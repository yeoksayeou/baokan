<h3 id="c25">美日外交接近與遠東（貞） <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>美日間之外交僵局。似已漸趨緩和。齋藤博與赫爾往返應酬。顯示太平洋之暗淡風。雲漸轉有晴霽之望。惟據日本所提對美妥恊前提之三要點。一爲拒絶移民。一爲承認僞滿。一爲撤廢菲島軍備。吾人就現勢加以分析。所謂移民問題。卽令美國解除有色人種之區别。照移民律之規定。日本人能移入美國者每年不過一百數十。並無補於實際。以日本外交之狡獪。固不必斤斤於虚名也。僞滿之不能承認。在胡佛氏當國時代卽早有宣言羅斯福繼任之初。其政府亦屢有否認之表示。此時决不肯輕上日本之當。而撤消以往光明正大之公言。以上兩端。卽日人亦未始不以爲係一種烟幕作用。借以掩飾實相而已。</p>
<p>提案之主要關鍵。仍在菲列濱之海空設備問題。蓋美國以菲島爲遠東根據地。非僅止軍事。卽與經濟亦有極密切之關聯。以軍事論。美國如能將馬尼剌與關島築成强有力之軍港。駐紮能勝征戰之艦隊與航空隊。則關島距横濱僅一千三百六十海里。馬尼剌距佐世保軍港。亦僅一千三百二十浬海程。日本所受之威脅最大。美國則卽遭損失。亦僅皮毛。故日本竭力高倡海軍比率平等之說。内以激動其國民。外以惹起英美之注意美國此時殊不願沾惹國際糾紛。致牽動其國内困難之擴大。此一百餘艘之巨大建艦計劃。雖未嘗無對日凖備之意味。然大半欲以彌縫其國内之工業。惟日本於此。殊不能無所忌憚耳。</p>
<p>不過美日間之經濟關係。不似英日關係之急驟。其相需之點。亦較英日爲多。英日固曾成立同盟。惟當時英日同盟之主要目的。在政治上共同動作。日本則猶在工業發展之初期。尙無與英國競賽之能力。現在時移勢易。遠東市塲幾爲日本所獨占。自印度以至於埃及。皆被日貨侵入。英貨勢將盡歸淘汰。是以英日衝突。乃漸行銳化。而美日之間。現在尙缺乏此種因素。美國之重工業產品。固急激需求海外消塲。此種消塲在遠東者。日本實居其一石油之消路。日本尤相當廣大。再則日本之生絲。唯一出路在美國。世人謂日本對外貿易在美國。實非過言。則日本之對美縱具充分仇視之心。實際上猶有不能脫離之苦矧美國現政府對日政策。仍以經濟戰爲核心。是以日人於此時。不能不急圖轉換其當前之急劇形勢。以美國放棄菲島軍備爲海軍比率之交換條件。所可注意者。美日間雖能暫時相當好轉。而日蘇關係。恐將更加惡化耳。</p>
<p>吾人於此種情勢之下。對美日關係與日本内情。須加以更深之推究。第一日本之外交政策。轉趨緩和。並非現在齋藤内閣之更換方針。實係日本軍部感於目前國際關係。不容日本繼續顯預。故乘勢求美國之諒解。希圖穩固彼日人在西部太平洋之地位。第二由此種外交上之應酬。可以窺知日本必借外交上之緩和。以便另有所企圖。其企圖中最急要者。一爲對付蘇聯。一爲侵略内蒙。其對蘇如何。姑置勿論。對内蒙之陰謀。則吾人不能不有嚴切之防備。我國今日之外交。處處痛感荆棘。進取固不易言。保持現狀。亦非易事。我國萬不宜過事遷就。形成畏怯之局。猶憶義和團事變後。李鴻章輩僅圖敷衍殘局。過存畏事之心理。致列國對華任意妄爲。終至滿清覆亡而始現轉機。現時我國國勢。較前固日有進境。而堅持一定方針。應用國際環境之力。則仍感不足。左右美日與日蘇關係。洵屬不易。然而抓着現實。確定方針。不作卑屈之折衝。不辭對等之交涉。認清對方之内情。穩定自國之地位。乘勢而進。或尙有克服目前困難。樹立國際間有利地位之一日耳。</p>

<p>前，昨兩日將問題提出，並對方君的觀點加了一點批判，今日進而研究方法，但首先仍應提出原則的討論，明日再將原則應用到問題的解剖。　　　　　　編者</p>
<p>在提出怎樣研究東問題的方法以前，我們要特别請求讀者注意的，是我們爲什麽要接受這一問題的檢討；爲什麽不呌諸君唸書，反而來談這國人所熟知的一筆舊賬呢？這緣因我們在前面已經略爲說過了，現在再要重復說的，祇是希望引起正在學習社會科學的諸君，在沉思默想之餘，將自己所學的理論運用到實際問題上來，在這裏，我們不過作一個例子，提示一些運用上的方法，自然，我們不能分析得更詳盡，也不能說完全没有缺點，道是要受篇幅及本欄的意趣限制的，同時，我們不是在這裏做文章，論「國是，」抒偉見，我們只是以「敎師」——如果不太僭越的話——的態度，來領導「學生」這二字也不很適當，請讀者勿笑我們自大也——去實習，但是，雖然是實習，却一點也不能媽虎，仍然像煞有价事的一樣，是以嚴肅的態度處理一切的。我們希望，今後本欄的讀者，大家來試作同樣的工作，把自己所學的理論，運用到解剖，批判某一政治，經濟或社會的具體問題，或應用到某一名著，某一名家小說，某一話劇，某一影片，某一自殺，「戀愛，」「盜文」，「綁票」等等方面去，以證實你的所學，而加强你的認識的力量。</p>
<p>以上的話交代過了，我們以爲，讀者再讀以下的本文時，是會感覺得更爲親切的。</p>
<p>現在回到東北問題這一實例上去罷。</p>
<p>研究東北問題，自然有許多的方法。但大致可歸納爲二種：一種方法是從靜態的，孤立的，主觀的方面去觀測；一種是從動態的，過程的，聯繫的，客觀的方面去觀測。在這二種方法的每一種中，因爲有些人徧重某一方面，或機械的死用法則，也可生出不同的結論，成爲非常混亂的現象，但是，眞正把握住了科學的精髓的人，並不會被這混亂現象所迷惑。</p>
<p>先略說第一種觀測的方法。</p>
<p>許多高等華人學者，都認東北問題的發生是出於日本軍閥的野心之故；並且不過是中國局部的問題，所以他們希望日本軍人覺悟，希望日本無產者起來革命，希望國聯主持正誼，希望國民鎭靜，慢慢使日人覺悟，希望由外交途徑去謀解决。他們中另一部分更聰明的學者還想引誘日本進攻蘇聯，以謀減輕日本的壓迫，認日人節節進逼是由於「匪」的出賣民族分散了抗日力量，認目前無抗日可能，至少還要等待十年（如胡適博士說的），所以現在只能談建設，培國力。</p>
<p>對於這些先生們的高論，自然，在這裏再用不着支費解了。鐵的事實，已揭穿了他們的虚僞。但是，他們這些「高論」儘管如何幼稚，荒謬，却也不是無原無故的。它仍是一種觀测方法下的結論。雖然，决定他们採取這種看法的是他們的羣團的利害關係，但是，這種看法却能麻痺許多追求眞理的青年的，譬如方君，無疑的就是其中的一個。</p>
<p>第二種觀測的方法，是在以下各種關聯上去觀察問題的發生，發展以及解决這一問題的途徑的。</p>
<p>（一）在國際（指資本主義體系）相互的關係上，卽在帝國主義與帝國主義國家的對立上，更具體的說，在世界經濟恐慌的深入，各帝國主義在太平洋的勢力的鬥爭上，去理解這一問題發生的一根據。</p>
<p>（二）在帝國主義與殖民地對立的關聯上去理解中國民族的危機。</p>
<p>（三）在資本主義與社會主義二大體系間的對立的關聯上，去理解反蘇戰爭，撲滅中國民族革命運動等。</p>
<p>東北問題是以上三組對立綜合上的產物，研究東北問題，不獨不能取第一種主觀的形式的研究法，而且也不能祇取第二種研究法中的任何的一部分，去機械的運用。因爲東北問題的複雜性，正是這三組對立交錯而造成的。我們祇有了解這種複雜性，了解造成這種複雜性的基礎，我們主纔談到正確的研究東北，認識這一問題的嚴重性。我們方纔談到如何正確的領導中國民衆去抗日救國。</p>
<p>但是，僅僅以把握了這問題發生的根源也還是不够的，因爲最近的國際事件是時時刻刻在變動的，這三組的對立雖然仍是尖銳的反映在東北及中國的全部，但因世界經濟的，政治的及社會的力的對比上起了變化，也是很機敏的要反映到這一問題上來的，這一來，問題就更複雜了。這是非常容易明白的，「九一八」的當日與現在比起來，當時的關係自然比現在要簡單，其嚴重性亦不似目前之可懼。我們在今日研究東北問題，也必須將的幾年的關係，判别到它的上面去，纔能使問題獲得最最現實的理解。</p>
<p>以上不過略示一點原則上的話，以下我們將以上的原則應用到問題本身上去，實行問題本身的解剖；同時，爲使讀者易於了解起見，在解剖的行文中，特提出形式觀察者的妙論作爲對照，並送他們到時代的昨日裏去。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c171">黎明卽起 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>在這長夜正漫漫，黎明尙有待的時代，居然有人發起黎明運動，理由是黎明卽起，可以暢暢地吸收幾口清鮮空氣，藏在肚裏，以免幹起事來，畏首畏尾地暮氣沉沉。</p>
<p>不錯，中國旣由老大帝國，返老還童而成爲少年中國之後，自然，甚麽都該奮發有爲，朝氣十足，才能不落伍，而不爲時代所吞噬。</p>
<p>所謂朝氣也者，自然幹起事來，切忌媽媽婆婆的，自然也不能無病而呻吟。</p>
<p>一年之計在於春，一日之計在於晨，黎明卽起，自然是一片大道理。不過黎明卽起，旣成爲運動，那麽，我想總也該訂定一些黎明卽起之後的工作，而似乎不該僅限於洒掃庭除，或練幾路太極拳，或宣揚一陣南無阿彌陀佛的佛號，或如有間階級般的提了百靈芙蓉上城隍廟喝茶。據我的鄙見，以爲不發起黎明運動則已，若要發起黎明運動，便該把辦公時間移到日出之時。因爲那時候，大地上滿佈着朝氣，大家在濃重的朝氣中辦公，服務精社，自然也會得孕育於朝氣之中，而甚麽都見得是有蓬勃的氣概了。——這總比了黎明卽起，暢昅朝氣，把朝氣藏在肚子裏慢慢地再呼出來，而溶化到工作裏去的要强得多了。這比了星期一三五舉行朝會，三次不到，卽予撤懲的規律也强些，因爲星期一三五雖然要舉行朝會，星期二四六，自然是不免堂而皇之地大窩其被窠了。這還成個甚麽話。</p>
<p>從前君主時代，五更三點，由宮女掌着紅紗燈上朝的，才是好皇帝＝。從此君王不早朝，從此天下多事矣。可知黎明卽起，確是極有道理。</p>
<p>長夜正漫漫，黎明尙有待，待到了黎明，大家起來罷，努力地在朝氣裏前進。</p>
<h3 id="c172">糞！ <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 老農</p>
<p>這也許大家要奇怪，我們每天是吃糞的，但是我要問；我們可否一天不吃飯，或一天不吃蔬菜，假使你的答覆是「不」的話，那我斷定你一定是吃糞的，因爲我們天天吃的東西，大半是靠着糞尿長成的。</p>
<p>我國拿糞尿來做肥料，已經有幾千年的歷史，除了一般生長在都市而不辨五穀的公子小姐們，大概都能知道這一回事。</p>
<p>糞尿在經濟上的價值，大可驚人，據金大敎授芮思婁Ｊ·Ｈ·Ｒeisner的統計，我國每年可出四千二百八十一萬二千萬磅的人糞，如果拿三分之二來做肥料，則爲二千八百五十四萬二千萬磅，約合二十一萬四千萬擔，假使每擔平均算他一角，已經值到二萬一千四百萬元的鉅欵了。</p>
<p>直接靠糞過生活的，固然要推農夫了，但商人靠糞發財的，正也不少。據說無錫的毛厠所以特别多，正是他們靠以度日的，聽說一家擁有毛厠三隻，就可以無凍餒之虞。</p>
<p>近來科學日漸昌明，糞的效用，亦合漸增大，德國有一位著名的科學家，名呌辛德門，他把糞製成了，硫酸錏，煤氣，炭氧二氣，松柏油，脂肪等用的吃的東西。</p>
<p>大家莫再瞧不起人糞，糞的效用，實在偉大，一般人稱糞爲「黃金汁」，倒並不過甚其辭。</p>

<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>端硯概况</p>
<p>硯的本質，前曾提到的，是在各地硯石中歸重於端歙澄三種，現在先就此三種提出說說，當然首要說到端了。</p>
<p>（一）水巖與山坑的分别　端石自唐初開採以迄清代至張之洞末次發掘爲止，其間開採的年代次數，與各坑的名稱，見於前人紀載甚夥，稍治硯學者都知道的，不須再煩縷述，大抵</p>
<p>唐宋時代所開的爲：下巖　中巖上巖　龍巖　半邊山諸巖　蚌坑　後歷茶園　將軍坑　小湘峽</p>
<p>明清時代所開的　大西洞　正洞　小西洞　東洞　（附拱篷　洞仔　廟尾）都稱爲水巖，卽唐宋時代所稱之下巖。此外在峽南的，如坑仔巖　老巖　宣德巖朝天巖　飛鼠巖　文殊坑　古塔巖屏風背等，在峽北的　龍爪巖朝敬巖阿婆坑等，在北嶺的　白綫巖　蟾蜍坑　宋坑　梅花坑　錦雲坑等，在西岸的　蘇坑　大坑頭　虎尾坑等，以上都稱爲山坑。（山坑僅錄其較著名者）</p>
<p>今所欲談的，第一問題就是水巖與山坑的分别，日人古河雅櫻在硯譚上曾說：「水巖與山坑的分别，日本的鑑賞家大家都能認識，但進一步能够分别山坑各石，孰優孰劣，已是甚少，若要更進而能够分虽水巖中孰爲正洞，孰爲東洞，孰爲大西小西，更不多見，至於指出水巖各石中爲第幾層石，則更談不到了，」這確是很不容易的事，不消說日本，卽以我國論，亦只有一二親自入山採購的風雅官吏與文人，及以開坑製硯爲生活的黃岡工人，能够辨别出來。自來討論硯質石性的著述，流傳亦實不少，但是能說得透切而有經騐的談話，確未多見。祇有道光年間嘉應吳石華所著的端溪硯史，最稱精覈，能將水巖四洞及每洞五層石質之美惡，逐一分别出來，前人對東西各洞之優劣，紛爭不已，後來都推重大西，石華所論，很正確的。吾人以爲欲認識水巖大西洞或水歸洞（卽大西洞之最深處）之石，所必需的條件：（一）「質」，密理堅細，温潤如玉，雖極光滑而能發墨下墨并脫墨。（滌之泮然無迹謂之脫墨）</p>
<p>（二）「色」宋以前的下巖北壁石，深紫如猪肝，潤若紫琳腴，磨之無聲，（此品已不多見）明以後的水巖，色多青白淡紫如羊肝，温柔軟煖，如新泉欲流。</p>
<p>（三）「聲」，扣之拍拍然如木聲，昔人稱爲無聲，非眞無聲也。</p>
<p>（四）「美文」如青花魚腦天青火捺蕉白鸜鵒眼等，都要鮮麗生動，紅白綠特别顯明活艷，如雲霞氤氲，有一片深純秀嫩之氣，合此數條件，必爲大西洞之名石。水巖以在水中，故愈見潤糯，前人神其說，稱爲泉生石中，非石生泉中，愛硯家奉爲名言至論，實則無是理也。</p>

<p>昨晚三四比二七勝英國</p>
<p>局勢緊張表演十分精彩</p>
<p>萬國女子籃球三角决賽、中華旣敗美國之後、昨晚遂與英國作最後决賽於中華籃球房、中華女將鑒於前次之敗於英國、昨晚無不小必翼翼、嚴密戒備、果然陣容一新、賴傳遞聯絡之美妙、陳榮明擲射妙中、中華遂以三十四比二十七擊敗英國、一雪前恥失敗之恨、並奪得本届上海萬國女子籃球錦標焉、茲先錄兩隊成績如下、</p>

<p>上半時　中華十八分　英國十六分　裁判舒鴻</p>
<p>下半時　中華十六分　英國十一分　檢察施肇康</p>
<p>神乎其技　昨戰形勢緊張、動作迅捷、興趣甚濃、中華女子活潑玲瓏、出神入化、前鋒銳利非凡、無空不入、陳榮明手法純熟、目光描凖、幾次遠射、神乎其技、堪嘆觀止、後衛因人矮吃虧、時有風險、幸球路純熟、先發制人、不使對方投籃、傳遞投射、華隊均在英國之上、而活潑善鬥、出没無定、尤爲對手不如、英國僅憑身體高大、論技術則遲鈍呆板、不足取也、觀者僅二三百人、吸引力似未見偉大、</p>
<p>得勝關鍵　全局聲勢緊張、激烈非凡、中華全隊平均、而陳聚明鷄羣鶴立、爲得勝功臣、英國之派克希爾與許列頓技亦甚佳、開始英國頗露鋒芒、華隊步步爲營、徐圖宏展、首節八比七佔先、第二節始、華隊分數大增、但卒被英國追上成十八比十六、上半時華隊僅勝二分、得勝關鍵、全在第三節中、中華共得十一分之多、對手僅取三分、縱然最後英或反攻、卒望塵莫及矣、</p>
<p>一分佔先　美國先聲奪人、出奇制勝、中鋒跳球、後衛接得、遙送籃下、Ｖ潑令斯與派克希爾互中一球、中華爲之一驚、後方乃嚴加防犯、楊森罰一中一、亦得三分、Ｖ潑令斯又中分、比數成七比三、英女大喜、華隊急起直追、前鋒漸能合拍、陳榮明不甘雌伏、近投遠射、大顯身手、霎時間連得五分、觀者精神興奮、雀躍三百、英國派克女士傷脚離塲、海蒙特替入、第一節於焉告終、中華八比七勝一分、</p>
<p>忽盛忽衰　派克女士繼續登塲、華人鋒芒正盛、不可一世、前鋒益見活躍、後方戒備益嚴、陳聚才首中後、楊森陳榮明相繼建功、分數大增、滿塲奔馳、勢若餓虎、英女大受威脅、鬰鬰頗不得志者甚久、然進取之心、未嘗稍懈、七比十八、相持未久、英隊亦步亦趨、咄咄逼人、形勢突然變更、Ｂ潑令斯罰球中的、星星之火、竟成燎原、往後、派克希爾等連得四球之多、分數一變而爲十八比十六、中華僅勝二分、</p>
<p>全盛時代　第二節中、最大比數、中華曾勝十一分、無猶非中華之黃金時代、下半時起、美國首中籃筐、成十八比十八、陳榮明三發三中美妙無比、愈戰愈勇、氣焰如熾、陳楊連續中的、聲勢浩浩、此爲中華之全盛時代、二十九比十九、相差十分、中華之基礎已固、勝利已具把握矣、</p>
<p>最後勝利　最後一節英國反攻甚烈、但門檻不精、被中華監佔後不能設法活動、故少投籃機會、故大機會、一再錯過、中華陣線頗見紊亂、形勢大不如前、雙方互有命中、表演則平淡無味、英國反攻猛烈、使中華飽受虚驚、最後一節八比五英國勝三分、總結果中華以三十四比二十七勝、</p>

<h3 id="c203">無聊 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 摩騰</p>
<p>文謅謅的摩登少年大多是没用塲的，因爲做起事來，只能空口喚旁人，譬如强盜進屋子里來了，他不能「以身捉賊」，只好讓强盜們將屋子搶光！</p>
<p>以身捉賊是要有本領的，因爲賊並不容易捉，卽是太極拳也要有功夫。其間大有愚智之分，不易易也。</p>
<p>且夫大道廢有仁義，詩亡然後春秋作，居士起而佛法亡，幽默興而是非死。所以然者，出於不得已，大家感覺無聊，嗡嗡嘖嘖，没有法子，怎樣呢，換一個湯頭吧。</p>
<p>蕭伯納好像描寫過一層地獄——與閻立本所畫的大有懸殊——這里没有惡鬼夜叉，鬼魂都好像浮烟似的。那里面有一個年齡問題，裝成十七八歲的女子麽，不時髦了，不如換一副時髦裝，那麽年齡在三十餘吧！算是更摩登一點。總之，得換過樣兒，打破氛圍的平庸與單調。好像金魚在玻璃缸里，游不出周圍透明的物質，那麽在里面多擺幾下尾兒吧，然也！</p>
<p>若干官僚的「風流」，「雅致」，大半是這麽養成的，逼出的。吃菜非某某廚子的不成，穿衣必用什麽質料。春來了必定去訪梅，秋深又必賞菊。這可以排遣悶氣怨氣之類，而且危險性較少。大旱，魚相濡以沫，如並此沫亦無呢，那麽大概都要乾涸成爲乾魚了。</p>
<p>哀哉！事物全没有永久性，話說便忘，飽後復饑，昨日旣以身捉賊，今日又還要捉賊，賊捉不完，如嗎啡針，要連連打下去。這便呌作没有法子。「吾摯愛之同胞乎」！聽隔墻之「杭唷」與木魚聲也！</p>
<h3 id="c204">春與女子 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 孟眞</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>春來了，在女子艷麗的新裝，在女子動人的眉梢「春意透酥胸，春色横眉黛。」是春已來到了人間。</p>
<p>只有我，依舊一件破棉袍，是春風吹不到。但是看見了春光耀眼，春色滿街，枯冬的心頭也不禁有點躍動起來了。</p>
<p>我走至大公司，看見五光十色的商品中，立着濃裝艷服，花枝招展般的女店員。她就是一種活動的廣告。</p>
<p>我漫步街頭，看見路上三五成羣的女郎，苗條的身材，鮮艷的旗袍；織腰一搦，臂影半圓，一擺一擺地遊着，正像玉泉的五色魚。</p>
<p>在從前，女子只是性慾的對象，生殖的機器，然而現在更是一件供人欣賞的藝術品。藝術品是珍貴易損的東西，所以我看見在女子身上，有禮敎與道德所寫就的紙條，警告一般的人們：</p>
<p>「眼看手勿動！」</p>
<p>Hadns　off！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>說到藝術品，女子可不是古董那樣的歷史的珍奇品，而爲一種如近代表現派，立體派的藝術般之流行的美術品。在女子的身上是充滿了時間的意義。</p>
<p>春來了，女子便是自然界的春的表現，春的象徴</p>
<p>因爲是這樣的富於時間性，所以像化妝品的雙妹牌，像香烟中的美女商標，在從前固曾是一世的流行，是所謂美的標凖，然而現在看去却成爲古董了，是時代落伍的事物了。</p>
<p>也因此故，所以孔二先生說過：「惟女子與小人爲難養也。」這意思便是說摩登男女是容易過時的。女子的青春期，至多不過十年—從十五到二十五—過了這時候，「綠葉成陰子滿枝，」已不是雜花生樹，羣鶯亂飛的陽春烟景了。</p>
<p>盧仝女兒曲云：「鶯花爛漫君不來，及至君來花已老，」所以美人遲暮，是人生最可傷感的事。而以此故，一般女子也確能把握住春光，不肯讓這如花的妙齡錯過。可不是嗎？春寒料峭，春正來到，男子尙多棉衣，女子已盡是飄飄然的單旗袍了。女子確是能迎頭趕上，得風氣之先的。在這一點；女子澈頭澈尾是個前驅者，她是與春同來人間的。並且，正如春象徴着萬物的萌生一樣，女子是人類的產生者。</p>
<h3 id="c205">我的目的（續） <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>（八）賭塲—是我在蕭山改的，那時正是日帝國主義者蹂躪淞滬的時候。這雖然是篇散文式的東西，我却也增加了三千字光景。這篇稿曾寄現代，編者以爲體材旣不像散文，又不類小說，故退；後刊登青年界。</p>
<p>其他三篇，比較改得少一點，所以不一一舉出。在這種事實之下，轉蓬一口咬定我「拿」了他的文章而未得他的允許，誠不知他的用心何在。其實在他已經知道文列的消息以後，他還呌我拿一篇下午到良友去，說他馬上要錢用，爲了方便點，問我可否署我的名字。我當時没有答應，他這種「明知故犯」，現在我才明白是什麽用意。</p>
<p>但不管如何，我過去對於創作的隨便，是無可容恕的錯誤。雖然我費了很多心血改作，使轉蓬的文章完全改了舊觀，但我並不想强辯，像上次那樣的企圖掩飾我們三個人罪過。除了轉蓬的文章，也曾改過陳福熙君的小說兩篇，拿過樓質明君的一篇，我也坦白的承認。而且像轉蓬指摘我的錯誤一樣的，我也希望他能很誠懇的改正跟我差不多的他的行爲：（一）他在南京中央日報上發表的太陽下的裸婦人，勞倫斯著，原譯者爲周光熙君；（二）他在杭州民國日報上發表的大學皇子，係傳尙杲君所作；（三）温梓川君的隨筆二册，他向彭成慧君要了去，說寄到中央公園去發表；（四）他也向陳福熙樓質明二君要過小說這種事實，在他的自白中，是不會說明的。我並不是存一種以怨報怨的心來檢舉，而是拿這事實來說明這種醜惡，並不是我個人的問題，而形成這種事實的，是傳統的虚榮—作家慾。這種虚榮，使我在開始時對於這件事企圖否認，以致有那篇「關於我的創作」。</p>
<p>可是事實告訴我，這種掩飾，祇有在利害相同的時候，才能奏效，否則遲早總要爆發的。因此，我深深的認識，這種醜惡的暴露，在表面上說來，是損害我的人格和名譽，其實是卽使把這種虚僞的人格與榮譽保持下去，也祇是戕害我自己。我年青，我應當有自信力，所以我現在很坦白的來承認我的錯誤。那就是說，作家這種虚榮，在我的生命中只是毒藥，我願意向我自己施一次肅清毒液的注射。但在這裏，我得鄭重的聲明，我並不一定放棄創作。不過我以後的創作態度，是要嚴肅而且忠實的。我决不想再唱「爲創作而創作」的那種空調子，而要從社會意義中去求表現的途徑。我對於目前以及過去的我，感到空虚而且渺小，但决不因此而灰心。我當警愓自己，從生活中去獲得創作的實踐的意義。我希望我自己能够沉默一個時候，如果是可能的話。</p>
<p>至於對楊邨人君等的威脅，我是絶對不會感到恐怖的，雖然他們在給陳福熙君的信上說：</p>
<p>「此事關係徐君，何君及先生三人，老實講如鬧出去，那是對於三位都有不利的，特别是何君……」</p>
<p>待桁君明目張膽的偏護轉蓬，說他「另有一番解釋」；那樣巧妙的說法，雖則很漂亮，却始終瞞不過賢明的讀者的耳目。</p>
<p>總之，我已從社會制度的根源上，認識了這一事實的意義，所以很直爽地承認我那篇「關於我的創作」是不坦白的，來向讀者揭發我自己的錯誤，希望能够得到公正的批判。至於那些威脅與帶惡意的攻擊，我却没有這麽多的閒功夫來理會。</p>
<p>這就是我的表白。</p>

<p>「媽的！」他彷彿要伸出拳來似的。「你拿去討飯嗎！一只碗也想偷……」他來回的走着，咬着牙齒。</p>
<p>他眞是一個眞正的北方人。</p>
<p>車子終於往前面　了。過了幾個高的牌樓似的鐵架，便停在一只輪船裏。走下去看可並不大。一共四排，只裝得下十二個車廂，機車把我們前面的四個車廂放下，再回去拖了四個來，最後又拖了剩下的二個。到了對岸，又這樣的來回了三次。七點四十五分到南京，十一點纔離開浦口北開。我覺得實在太慢了。照從前的辦法，我相信在這時間内，我們可以從南京到浦口來回兩三次。這偉大的輪渡，給我們的是肉體的舒服，不必上下，但同時牠給了我們靈魂的不安，使我們等候的焦急。牠又减少了我們一點行李的挑資，但同時也就减少了那些苦力的收入。</p>

<p>（一）</p>
<p>清早起，露水深，</p>
<p>打濕荷包與手巾。</p>
<p>打濕手巾不要緊；</p>
<p>打濕了荷包啊，</p>
<p>費姐錢幣又費姐心！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>日頭落山嶺背陰，</p>
<p>嶺背泉水冷清清；</p>
<p>勸姐莫吃冷泉水，</p>
<p>冷泉冷水冰良心，</p>
<p>嫁得人家無子孫！</p>
<p>苗。不曉得是心理的作用，還是眞的事實，總覺得没有可看的野景。記得去年夏天坐着車往蘇州，微黃的稻和碧綠的荳葉像輪子似的在眼下滾動着，是多麽有趣呵！</p>
<p>三·隴海道上</p>
<p>到了徐州，想念起這裏的幾個老朋友。不曾踏到這裏的土地，已經十幾年了。這十幾年怎樣過去的？夢一般。少年的筵席在那裏呢？有些死了，有些没有消息。我至少想望一望這久違的故國。但夜是黑暗的，什麽也没有，幾點暗淡的燈火，像幽靈一樣。</p>
<p>。　。車裏的乘客，現在完全換了一副相貌。他們的皮膚全是粗而且老，没有一個像年青的人。灰色或黑色的衣服，映着青銅的面色。男的女的，都緊紮着褲脚。車廂中偶然聞到剌鼻的蒜氣。雖然這許多人都是由不同的地方而來，但衣服行李，幾乎全是國貨，看不見一點洋氣或南方的風流。我感覺到我看見了眞正的中國人。</p>
<p>查票的每站都來麻煩，不曉得什麽意思。熟睡纔不久，就給推醒來。剛纔一個五六歲的孩子没有買票，現在一個三四歲的却必須買票了。</p>
<p>「四歲半票！章程這樣訂的！」</p>
<p>於是客人就没有話說，只好掏出錢來。</p>
<p>「他可没有辦法知道你眞的幾歲！」隨後一個跟着查票的兵士說，當他們查完了票以後過了一小站，查票的又來了。現在輪到了一個剛上來的鄉下的女人。她帶着一個三四歲的小孩。她不肯補票，她說一個月以前還坐過這車子，一樣帶着這個孩子，一樣没有買半票。然而她說孩子是四歲。</p>
<p>「四歲就得買半票，你現在再說一句，到底是幾歲吧！」查票的顯然對她特别客氣，希望她否認剛纔的話，把四歲改成三歲。</p>
<p>但她不瞭解，她不懂得說謊的利益，她依然回答說四歲。於是她不得不補了一張半票。</p>
<p>她眞愚蠢。在南方，聰明的人太多了。這種問題，不是連一個小孩子也曉得應付的嗎？</p>
<p>黎明的時候，機車噴着白沫，雲一樣，在地面蜿蜒着。牠掩住了荒凉的沙原，在我們的眼前幻出美麗的山水來。我十年前曾經走過這條路，但那時是在夏天，車廂開着窗子，進來的全是灰沙和乾燥的熱氣。現在兩旁的樹木愈加多了，可惜都還枯裸着。倘在春天，閉着車窗，擋住了灰沙的飛揚，在綠葉林中前進着，恐怕全中國再也找不出這樣美麗的旅程呢。（未完）</p>

<p>— 林徽音</p>
<p>依娜和以杰離開到現在已快四個月了；在離開的當時她只感到一種被遺棄的痛楚，而在現在却實受到了生活的壓迫。</p>
<p>在以杰剛走的時候，她想男子是那樣地無情，想玩遍一切的男子，可是，在事實上，在她能玩到一個男子以前，她就給一個定律束縛住了。她想以杰的所以能那樣地輕易離她而去，就爲她與他之間没有一個名義。她先要一個名義，要是她再同什麽男子結合的話。要是没有那個定律在那里作崇，她是早就可以和冶初同居了的。她覺得她是在愛他，可是她總放不下他那在他家鄉的妻子。</p>
<p>而現在她所最感到切要的並不在要得到，或者要怎樣得到一個男子，而在她和她的一家人的生活怎樣得以解决。要是有什麽熟人知道她的待解决的是這樣的一個問題，是會好笑或者會不相信的，這，她知道，可是在她自己，那確是一個不能稍微放鬆的事實，因此她更感到了雙重的悲哀。而她的所以以前不大寫東西而現在只要有人請她寫她就總想寫的唯一的關鍵就在一些急切待用的稿費。</p>
<p>就爲了那同一的理由，她答應了席卓雲爲文藝半周刊寫一個中篇小說。</p>
<p>從第二天，就是從星期一起，依娜的確開始了她的「生之味」。她預先關照好了她的母親，要她回答一切給她的電話說「她不在家，」而日夜地把自己關在她那小室中。</p>
<p>這樣地過了差不多兩個星期，那「生之味」完成了，一起有一百四十餘張原稿紙。完成了，依娜心中很高興，很輕快。因爲她想照預約好了的，每千字四元發表費，她可得到二百多元，可勉强過那年關了。要是能把版權同時賣掉，她還可在年底與歲首舒服幾天。</p>
<p>雖說是年底，歲首，其實那時年是已過了的。她脫稿的那天是一月二十日，可是是陰曆的十二月初六。——是的，她所說的年關是陰曆的，而且也只有陰曆年似乎才成爲關。在平時她不大注意陰曆的日子，可是一近陰曆的年底，她幾乎把陽曆完全忘去了，她只記得陰曆的。尤其在今年，時期還没有跨進十二月，她就在担心怎樣過她的年了。所以，現在她旣已寫畢了她的「生之味」，她的高興，她的輕快，顯然不是没有理由的。</p>
<p>脫稿是在晚上，而第二天，初七，是星期日，席卓雲並不去他的辦公室，她又不願意到他的家裏去，因此她决定把交稿的事情移下到了星期一。</p>
<p>而在星期日那一天，她去約了一兩個熟人，痛快地頑了一天，以舒展她的兩星期以來所被壓抑着的精神與身體。</p>

<h3 id="c245">要求麵包而不欲巡洋艦 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>全世界經濟恐慌日益加深，失業之羣有增無减，各國社會現狀愈趨不穩之勢。一般執政者，他們很明白這是個萬分危險的景象。可是現在世界各國，久已形成一種畸態的發展。這發展永是矛盾的，至今没法調濟。牠們一面目睹國</p>
<p>内幾百幾千萬衣食無依的工人，日陷於水深火烈之境，不思拯救。一面又把由國民身上榨取得來的大宗欵項，作爲製造殺人利器之需。意思牠們是以爲想解决失業問題，必先要維持資本主義的勢力。故牠們將國家所有的財物，盡量用於建戰艦造飛艇，而呌其他無以謀生的人，暫時餓着肚子。其實戰艦飛艇果能挽回不景氣的厄運嗎？誰都知道，現代各資本主義國家的生產組織，已呈着不少的缺陷。這缺陷最大者，卽是生產機關盡操在少數人的手裏，所以縱使武力眞可以促助資本主義的擴展，其利潤也不過爲幾個特殊階級者所獨佔，於大衆生活，還是没有影響的。最近英國倫敦非業工人看穿了這一點，便組織一個飢饉長行隊，向政府請願說：「吾人要求麵包，而不欲巡洋艦！」</p>
<p>眞的，只有麵包才能解决失業者的飢餓，巡洋艦反足以增重他們的痛楚。麵包可以養活人，巡洋艦却會殺人。然而現今世界各國，那一個不是在强奪飢餓者口裏的麵包，瘋狂地去趕造巡洋艦麽？</p>
<h3 id="c246">棉旗袍 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>「先生，你很怕冷嗎？」有一天早上，那還是一個深秋的早上吧，那時我還在一個學校敎書，穿了一件新縫成的棉旗袍到學校去上課，有一個學生這樣的問我。我告訴她是的，並且加上解釋，是因爲身體不大舒暢才穿得這樣早。小學生到底不懂得，過了兩天她看見我還是穿着那件袍子，她又像關懷似的問我說：「先生你的病還没有好嗎？」不隨人意的天氣，偏要在那幾天不刮寒風，弄得人們整天都在注意我的棉袍子，我不由得的回答：「是的，病還没有好哩！」可憐一片純凈的好意，受了我冷冷的這一句，還用着眼睛斜矑着她，把她嚇死，不岂說第二句的走開了。</p>
<p>晚上回到家裏，房間向北，想把袍子脫下，穿上單的好像很冷，思量了一會，還是把紐子解開，坐到床上，用氈子蓋着兩條赤脚，我想這樣至少可以使袍子的後面不會起好多縐紋。天天我都這樣的愛護它，但在人家的眼裏看來，它已經很汚舊了，</p>
<p>不管它是這樣的汚舊，它終歸是我唯一的棉旗袍，除了它，我又不能檢出兩件夏天的紗袍子來當秋天的夾袍子用。在没有縫它的時候，我也曾經打量了好久，很想把它縫成夾的，可是又怕穿了不久，天氣又冷了，那麽我再找不着錢來做第二件；若是棉的，到嚴寒的時候，我也不用愁，雖然目前受人家譏笑一下，於是我的棉旗袍已於四個月前的某一天縫好了。</p>
<p>回想耶穌聖誕的前夜，朋友硬拉我去跳舞，我很高興，但一想起自己穿着半舊的棉袍子，再幻想到在舞塲的小姐太太們，不是露臂的就是露胸露背，我却背着厚厚的棉袍子，那不引人注意暗笑嗎？老朋友過於熱誠，不管我怎樣推辭，結果她把我安置到舞塲的左邊好好的坐着，音樂鼓動了我的奮興，好幾次我也擠到人堆裏在地板上溜來溜去，溜得汗水也流出不少，後來又碰着許多熟人，他們都很高興的來請我跳一跳，過了幾個鐘頭，弄得自己很難耐。實在太熱了，汗流有如在暴日之下曬了半天一樣，我眞怕身上要發出不好的氣味，人家小姐們的味道的清香的，而我，啊，我不敢說了。</p>
<p>這一來，眞悔恨當時做棉旗袍的計劃。没有法子只得早些離開那暖氣重重的舞塲，走出馬路邊，寒風重新向我的臉上刮來，此時我又想，到底還是棉旗袍好！可惜它給我穿得太黑了，哥哥也說我的領頭已經起了黑色的油跡很難看，於是我下了决心把它送到洗衣館子去，他們開了一張洗費要八隻角子的單子給我。三天之後，我穿着一件過時的單衣立在玻璃窗外，看見它已經洗得很好的挾在許多别人的衣服當中，我想它是我唯一的棉旗袍，我希望下個星期可以把它拿回來，仍然屬我所有。</p>
<p>然而，春寒還是剌骨，下個星期是多麽難挨的呵！</p>
<p>我愛我的棉旗袍，它始終是我的寳貝。</p>
<h3 id="c247">「自殺底人」 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 子</p>
<p>「喂，朋友，你上那兒去的？這部車子到新世界就回頭的。」</p>
<p>「到黃浦灘去。……唉——」</p>
<p>「黃浦灘不去的，到新世界你下去吧。」</p>
<p>「唉——完了！」</p>
<p>一輛擁擠得水洩不通的一路汽車車廂裏，在後面一個角落，坐着一個中年的西裝漢子，把頭仰着眼珠向上翻起，口裏嘆氣，不時哼着「完了！」同車的乘客，都拿驚奇的眼光注視着他，賣票的也覺看了，擠過來打着上海的京腔在盤問他。車子到了新世界，賣票的硬要他下去，說是「車子回頭進廠了」；他没有理，還是嘆氣搖頭，咬着嘴唇，拿一方烏黑的手巾抹着眼角。</p>
<p>「這到外灘去找誰？」青年的賣票極社氣地像個審判官。</p>
<p>「到外灘找ＸＸＸ碼頭去，」答話太沉濁，含糊，聽不清。</p>
<p>「什麽？……碼頭？……」</p>
<p>「唉！你管我什麽碼頭！誰有心思和你歪纒？唉！」這次嘆出來的氣，聲音很尖銳，嗓子有些抖。</p>
<p>「自殺的人！」同車的乘客在交頭接耳的斷定這傢伙的奇怪行徑了。</p>
<p>車子靠在外灘的站頭，我打了同伴的一個招呼，就跟着這奇怪的人在人羣裏走出車廂外來。他朝南蹣跚地，横衝直撞的汽車，他似乎也毫不顧及地向着江邊奔去，我被他那離奇地誘惑，吃了一驚，以爲他眞個會自殺的了，也不顧不一切地趕上去抱着他的手臂。</p>
<p>「喂，你亡了命地跑到這江邊幹嗎？」我喘着氣大聲地問他。</p>
<p>「……」他睜着眼睛注視着我，從他的眼裏流露出他對於我底同情的感謝。</p>
<p>「你是不是要自殺？」我仍是這樣大</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>聲地問。</p>
<p>「不。……你這人怎的這般不會說話，開口就問人自殺？……」</p>
<p>「那麽你一個人跑到這江邊來幹嗎？朋友，今天我也没事兒，咱們談談吧。」我挽着他的擘，踏上愛多亞路朝西走着，於是我知道他是山西太原人，在法國學機械五年，一九三二年回國，現任雲南昆明市政府法文秘書，刻因故鄉的愛妻死了，老父打電報來趕他回去料一喪事。</p>
<p>「你上海來過没有的？有同伴麽？住在那裏？」</p>
<p>「只一個人，上海還是頭一趟來……唉……」</p>
<p>「你有什麽傷心的事，咱們四海皆兄弟，告訴我有辦法大家想想看吧。晚飯吃過没有？……」</p>
<p>「唉！山窮水盡，到上海來兩天了，只吃了一次麵，身上只四毛錢，還吃什麽晚飯！我伴鬼睡了兩宵了哪！……唉……」</p>
<p>「朋友，我請你吃飯去。你能翻譯去文嗎？我介紹你職業好嗎！」</p>
<p>「唉，你這人怎麽不怕煩，老拖着我幹嗎？快放我走。我又不是没事的誰要你的事」他掙脫我的手，又要回頭朝東走。我因爲好意要介紹他事情，他倒怪起我來，心裏很不願意，但我開始</p>
<p>對他懷疑了，我仍然拖着他的臂向西走，折北，朝西，又折北，又朝西。途中我又問他關於最近幾個在法國留學回來的朋友的事，當我提起他們的名字的時候，他總是重復一遍，說這個名字很熟的，但他說不出他們的情况來。後來我問以一個和他同年留法學機械同年回國</p>
<p>而新近因受了無業的剌激，便患了神經病的朱ＸＸ，他竟回說在法國學機械的並没有這個人。</p>
<p>「嗄嗄，你没事兒，可别誤了我的事，拖着我是不是要綁票？放！」當我們很平靜地走近一所紅牆高房子的時候，他拚命要掙脫我，並且把身體向後轉地拽着；我温柔的對他說：</p>
<p>「何必呢？朋友，中國的人才缺乏呀！學機械的將來有出頭的日子的……咱們吃飯去吧。……」</p>
<p>「别開玩笑，你請我吃飯，何必拖我上這裏來？剛剛走過飯館爲什麽不吃？」呀，原來我們已走上四馬路最冷靜的一段路上來了，前面的寫房子不是巡捕房嗎？哦，巡捕房，剛才他的「别開玩笑……何必上這兒來？……」就很新鮮　脆地振擊着我的腦經，我意識到他的一切，我心裏明亮地想着：「試探他一下吧，」我嚴厲地說：</p>
<p>「你看，我是巡捕房裏的偵探，你和我到房裏去坐坐去。」我把内衣上的館徽露出來給看，但很决地又把衣放下來。</p>
<p>「朋友，自家人開什麽玩笑？各人走各人的路吧。」他氮忿用力地摔脫我的手，逕自朝南大踏步去了。</p>
<h3 id="c248">婦女職業 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 沈敏</p>
<p>談到婦女職業，現在也可說是社會上一個重要問題了。但是：作者不是女性：又是最不會近女性的人：而且這個問題太複雜了，决非短短的篇幅就可研究的。所以這裏僅僅就個人一時感覺，來對本問題上做一些部份的貢獻！</p>
<p>隨便什麽事，都有來由的。婦女職業問題的來由，可以將婦女解放史來說：因爲向來婦女是主家的，家以外就没有她的地位，在她們人生意味上太拘束了，　以要　解放。解的初期，就是婦女求學。我們回想幾年之前，一般有知有覺的女同胞們，都在那裏爭得求學的機會。後來這問題，因爲是順着時代潮流的，所以勝利了，雖然也免不了一點波折。但是，求學不過是一種解放的前奏曲；換句說：求學的結果，不過得到一點知識和有一點應用技術罷了。有了知識，有了應用技術，當然要求用處；而且整個婦女解放問題上當然不能說得到一點學問就算够了，所以婦女職業問題，就是婦女解放的第二步工作；也是目前最重要的一個問題啊！</p>
<p>時代之潮是很凶猛的，在每一個浪花展開時，就有許多犧牲者，這是現實告訴我們是如此的。現在婦女職業問題，就同一個潮浪一樣，方在展開呢！所以我們翻開每日的新聞紙，就有許多在這潮流裏的犧牲報告。同時在這不景氣社會裏，要謀女子的出路，以乎也是萬分困難。</p>
<p>因此，我們要研究本問題，就不能不爲婦女安全上着想。或者有人說這是整個社會組織問題，必須要改造社會着手。我想，這或者不盡然吧？依我的意思遠是要婦女自己去解决。至於，我所貢獻的是這樣：在未出嫁的女子，應該充分凖備着各種普通應用技術或知識。將來得着伴侶了，就可帮助丈夫去工作。例如，丈夫是個醫生，那末，做妻的去担任助手；或者充看護。丈夫是個商人，做妻的也可以做會計一類的事。在已嫁的婦人呢，那就更容易了，只要就丈夫的事業範圍以内可以勝任的去做。這樣一來，婦女在工作之外就少了許多不便和危險。而且做丈夫的得到忠實可靠的助手，對於事業上，一定格外興奮。同時，婦女職業問題上，也可免了許多阻力。</p>
<p>或者有人說我的主張，仍舊免不了「女子爲男子附屬品」一句話，這話：在表面上，是有相當理由的，但實際上是一個不成問題的問題啊。因爲處在現今的社會，除了極小部份之外，無論男女在外做事，眞怕没有不受到壓迫的？愈其做别人的附屬品，倒不如做丈夫的附屬品。况且婦女在丈夫底下做事，在名義上是帮助丈夫，在實際上倒還是彼此分工合作。在另一方面，也有彼此監視行動的作用。其結果，當然可以彼此得到信任愉快。同時，也可說是男女平等的眞締；婦女解放的目的！</p>
<p>不過我這篇文字，特别爲一般知識界婦女寫的。在這裏附帶聲明，做本篇的結尾吧！</p>

<p>湖州丁家村有一個倚勢仗財的丁員外；他私自創一種魚稅，强迫一般漁人完納給他—他便坐着得許多銀錢，而且一文也不肯少欠。這圖就是一些漁人恭恭敬敬來繳納魚稅的情形。</p>

<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>是初春的天氣，空氣裏不見了寒凉，含藴着輕和的風，吹在人們的身上，爽爽地。</p>
<p>呵，多麽值得寳貴呀，這春宵的蕩漾。</p>
<p>挾着積鬰下的苦悶的心情，在堂皇的南京路上踏着，BulckFordDonge……油亮而光潔的，滾着，一陣輕風似的，從耳房過去了。</p>
<p>—坐一歇吧，呵？—去吧！</p>
<p>在永安公司的樓窗外，飛來了這樣的一句鶯聲，音波，是如此的恊調而細膩呵！</p>
<p>踏上了大東酒樓的石級，在我的心中悸動了一下！</p>
<p>—他們不會把我趕出來吧？或許，他們要盤問我一個仔細吧—像對待小偷是的？我自忖着，不能自禁的。</p>
<p>還好，忙碌的他們，似乎没有注意到我。於是，悄悄地，沿着那厚厚的氈子步上了樓，聲音是非常的低微的。</p>
<p>光彩的電燈，懸驟在一個甬道口上，燈下站着的，是許多穿了整潔的白衣衫底極有氣派的人。他們的眼睛向我釘視着，彷彿要披尋些什麽東西是的，於此，我　抖了，幾乎失去了前進的勇氣。</p>
<p>對天，我總算逃過了那個難關，雖則經過了一度的訊問。</p>
<p>進了禮廳，在眼前閃爍的是：白的桌布，白的椅套，無數的人頭，長短不等的身材，紅的綢幛，黃黃地金字……這，一切，向我撩撥着，直覺到有無數的火花在面前亂跳。</p>
<p>終於，我也被安置在一個白套椅上。經過了一個相當的時期，覺得這些人的眼睛，都不像甬道外的那般的利害，於此，先前的膽量，慢慢地恢復了。</p>
<p>屋頂，雪白的，每一個方隔子裏，乳色的燈泡在吐着乳色的光芒，一盞一盞地，溶在人們的臉上，現示着春情的活躍。</p>
<p>南首的一端，那年紅電管所綴就的喜字的台子上，光暈，紅紅地，浸潤着那鮮嫩的花朶，瞧，她在展笑了。</p>
<p>髮香，粉香，膚香，種種地香霧由時髦的女賓身上播送着，吹在年青人的心頭，吹在年老人的鼻管；否黃，赭石，咖啡，濃黑……不同的顏色，裏着不同的窈窕的身段。</p>
<p>瓜子，在各個人的嘴裏剥着，壳子不經意的吐在地上，香烟，在隨便的吸着，烟霧輕輕地繚繞在屋中：香蕉，皮子剥了下來，「撲」！帶有黑尖的一頭，由嬌紅的口唇裏吐在凈潔的盤子上。</p>
<p>菜，更換着，一樣一樣地，酒，在大的銅壼裏，灌進了小的銀壼中，再送入人們的肚子内。在新郎新娘透露了笑容「巡敬」以後，煩囂的一幕呵！漸漸地由稀薄而沉默了。</p>
<p>出了大東的門，風，迎面的吹來，輕和的，吹在人們的身上，空氣裏不見了寒凉，是初春的天氣。</p>

<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>雨聲起勁地打在雷上，没有停止的模樣。袁文向被水蒸水迷漫了的窗上望了一眼，自語似的說了：</p>
<p>「應該回去了……」</p>
<p>「早啊。」</p>
<p>剛說完話，茶役探進頭來問：「朱先生吃夜飯不？」我不及回答，文姊搶着說：「那我回去了！借一枘傘有嗎？」</p>
<p>問茶役有傘没，我向她說：「吃了夜飯去吧，或者雨停止。一個人在雨中走路不很方便？這個時候又呌不到車子。」</p>
<p>「那你送我去！」直截爽快地。</p>
<p>我遲疑了一下。</p>
<p>「不送也可以。」她笑着。</p>
<p>我點點頭說：「送你去。」回頭吩咐茶役我不吃飯了，請他們先吃罷。</p>
<p>走出門來，一望無際的雨。葛嶺那邊隱約幾處燈光，在雨絲中飄搖不定。我們倆個人合着一柄傘，在蘇堤上慢慢走去，没有說話，脚聲和着雨聲，倒是别有一番光景。到杭州將近半年，常喜歡獨自東跑西竄，自以爲杭州的勝景都找遍了，然而雨後的西湖却有别出的美麗。心中這末一轉念，想早些送她到校，好一個人在雨中暢玩，脚步自然放快了。</p>
<p>「走慢一點。」她的右臂撞我執傘的手，「回去時候怕鬼嗎？」她忘形似的笑起來，雨傘乘風一側，洒了滿面的雨。</p>
<p>走完蘇堤，向左拐個灣，就到她學校。她敲着門對我說：「校中的同事雖我很好，可我總同她們合不來，常常勉强地隨和着她們，太没有趣味，你空閒的時候來談談，二年多不見面了。」</p>
<p>隨意地點着頭，忙不及待的回身走。剛走上蘇堤，後面搶前兩個人，没有雨具，遍身淋着雨水，矮的一個提着一隻籃，盛着幾碗菜，已分不清是魚是肉了，及致祭的香爐燭臺等。長的一個喘着氣，跑路時像已失去了重心，東斜西倒的。矮的開口說了「媽，當心！」我纔知道是母子倆，掃墓歸去。</p>
<p>滿懷預備在雨中玩一回暢快的心，見了他們母子倆，忽然打消了。無謂的　到，表姊回到學校要怨恨我太冷淡嗎，校門中　角的桃花現在變了什麽　樣，同時想到同事們對於這不速之客作怎麽猜疑？而且莫明其妙地唸起「清明時節雨紛紛，路上行人欲斷魂！」的詩句來。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c255">黑人戲劇名著「瓊斯皇」現已製成電影 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 塵雄</p>
<p>黑人，似乎在我們紙醉金迷的城市裏，已經給與我們特殊的認識，特别在時行的跳舞塲，每夜加插表演節目中，常有什麽黑人跳舞，黑人滑稽表演，黑人蹕躂絶技，好像除了引動人們歡樂之外，黑人就不必去幹别的事業了。</p>
<p>我們知道美國文學幾部名著，都是關於黑人生活的描寫，其著者當推女作家史地萊所著，我國林琴南所譯的「黑奴籲天錄」一書，就是環球公司製爲影片的「黑奴魂」了。年前名導演金維多製作的黑人宗敎影片「夏里路也」，也是一部轟動銀壇的佳作。</p>
<p>戲劇家洪深與顧仲彜二人合譯的奥尼爾原著黑人戲劇「瓊斯皇」，於去年由聯藝公司製成電影近日可在本埠公映，影片的譯名已改爲「覇王末路」。原劇是一部獨幕劇，内分八場，在舞臺上表演着的是劇中人瓊斯在第一塲開始，已做了一個小島皇帝，這時正是他的末日降臨，島民謀叛，餘下七塲就描寫瓊斯在森林裏狂亂奔命樣子。電影的「瓊斯皇」則追述瓊斯未做皇前的事實，似乎比舞臺劇的故事詳盡一點，後半部瓊斯做皇帝情形，與舞台劇大同小異。</p>
<p>奥尼爾的戲劇製成電影的，前有葛雷泰嘉寳主演的「安娜克利斯蒂」（影片譯名爲「碧水情怨」），瑙瑪希拉主演的「奇怪的插曲」（影片譯名爲「紅粉飄零」）。後一部舞臺劇「奇怪的插曲」在紐約上演時，在下午二時開塲直做到十一時始散場。中間隔着給觀衆食餐與休息時間，這也算是奇怪的插曲了。「瓊斯皇」一劇曾有三種不同的演出：第一種是舞臺劇，由著名伶人齊爾賓氏飾瓊斯；第二種是歌劇，由歌壇驕子並一度蜚聲銀幕與露范麗合演「長恨天」的勞倫斯鐵拔飾瓊斯；第三種就是影劇了。</p>
<p>飾影劇的「瓊斯皇」主角保羅勞比生，比舞臺上的齊爾賓氏與歌劇的勞倫斯鐵拔還要馳名。這是因爲勞比生在三種不同演出的「瓊斯皇」舞臺，歌劇，影戲—他都扮演過了。勞比生原籍黑人，故此他所飾的瓊斯，更加逼眞透澈。勞比生曾在美國哥林比亞大學法律科畢業，但他不做律師而做演員，且他天賦的歌喉，極適合歌劇。他第一次登臺劇是奥尼爾的「上帝之子皆生翼」，繼後就是「瓊斯皇」。年前勞比生往倫敦表演歌舞的「瓊斯皇」，大受英皇及后的歡迎，因</p>
<p>爲勞比生雖是黑種人，不失爲一個學者，英國人又不像美國人對於黑人的歧視，故在英國時，著作家威爾斯，首相麥唐納，前首相勞意喬治，英王太子等皆以嘉賓待之。勞比生因爲這樣受着英國人的厚禮，本不想再回美國去，因聯藝聘他主演影劇的「瓊斯皇」，所以待影劇拍好之後，又到英國去永遠居住了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c256">評「幕中人」 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>—中央—</p>
<p>當我們檢討一次中國的文學作品的時候，有不少優秀的創作，說明了中國文壇的確是有了可喜的收獲。可是同時粗製濫造的東西，也的確多得可以。這不僅是一般内容空虚淺薄，而在創作技巧上亦顯得十分落後。自然，這是非常可怕的現象。</p>
<p>同樣，在電影領域中更是如此。一方面有着「人生」，「中國海的怒潮」等比較優秀的作品，另一方面也有「幕中人」這一類的影片存在。「姊妹花」不是已經映了三十餘天而企圖打破「愛斯基摩」的世界賣座紀錄嗎？雖然它影片本身到底有許多不够滿意的地方，但是它已經使歐美影片商人大爲驚訝了。然而我們的電影作家却應當何以更進一步的發揮這一光榮呢？這是「幕中人」的作者值得注意的了。</p>
<p>「幕中人」是月明公司的出品，我們不會忘記同一公司的「惡鄰」，雖然那也一過是幼稚的東西，但是比之「幕中人」却是强多了。</p>
<p>無論如何，「幕中人」是水平綫下的作品。原因是爲了拚命的迎合觀衆之低級興趣，於是不管三七二十一的將愛情，武俠，偵探，倫理，不倫不類的硬拉在一道。</p>
<p>有人說，對於小公司的出品，應當稍取寛容的態度，不能使用大公司同樣的尺度。這種說法，是否得當，在此不欲多言，但是是，像「幕中人」這樣無聊的東西，假使也不加以嚴格的批評，那不是有意斷送中國電影的前途嗎？</p>
<p>我希望「幕中人」的作者不再將電影作兒戲，很虚心的多下一番研究的苦功，否則恐怕將永遠被進步的觀衆所遺棄。</p>
<h3 id="c257">評「僥倖少女」 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 高原</p>
<p>“MaidHappy”—光陸蘭心—</p>
<p>影片作者當他創作的時候，假使爲了他劇作的便利，隨意的展開故事，在編劇，導演，…等上，只求簡便，迅速，以現實生活中片斷的形象來滿足他故事的完成，而不顧及這一片斷的形象，在該劇中或該塲中是否切合，是否眞實，在劇作者方面是容易的，但在作品的價值上說起來，就成爲大問題了。</p>
<p>凡是偉大的藝術作品，莫不是生活的眞實的表現。缺乏眞實性，是没有藝術價值的，對於藝術作品創作態變，需要嚴肅，偉大的藝術作品產生之所以是艱苦的工作，也就爲此。</p>
<p>「僥倖少女」在作者是以生活中的片斷形象來完成他的故事，而没有顧到生活的眞實性的。</p>
<p>最主要的，譬如：一個少年英俊的外交官，爲了一張外交機要的卡片給了一個少女，形成了這一劇的中心，許多人物圍繞着這一件事在活動，眞實的生活中我們就很難看到這種事實，可以說</p>
<h3 id="c258">愛火的起端—高占非，談瑛在聯華巨片「風」中的表情，吳村導演 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>是十分例外的。其餘劇情中巧合的地方很多，許多重要的關鍵，轉機都很虚搆，看了不是生活，而是假戲，而是爲了有這些機會，演員們出來會面，談話，唱歌，堆積些事實，做到最後一吻完塲而已。</p>
<p>英國是一個老大帝國，一切產業文化的發達都很早，以剥削殖民地和國内農工來維持他們上憎社會的生活，所以在上層社會所需要的，只是清淡的詼諧，清閑的音樂等以滿足他們剥削之餘的心情，實生活他們是不願觸及，卽觸及也要歪曲的。在英片（當然其他也很少例外）所以很難有價值的作品出現，也是有理由的。</p>
<p>導演者在這樣一個故事中要想展開他的手腕是很難的，而Mansfieldmarkbam，除了在音樂的效果上相當用心以外，此外和編劇一樣，笨拙的地方很多</p>
<p>Charlotteand和JohannesRiemann在這樣一個故事中，也没有充分發展他們技能的地方，Charlotteander的表演技能不及J·Ｒiemann。此外的男女老敎授，騙子，都能表現他那種人物所特有的性格，從他們的性格倒獲得了些零碎的效果，當然是覺得可笑的效果。背景在瑞士，塲面上所看見的風景，夜花園的生活，這些地方總算是盡了些「介紹風景」的任務，倘若純粹介紹瑞士風景，作爲紀錄影片，意義或者還要來得好些。</p>

<p>— 素梅</p>
<p>那個大廣廳裏，夜深人靜的時候，忽然一個黑影子在移動着。冬天皎潔的月光，從窗口射進來，映在地板上和墻上，幻成可怕的黑白的影子。那個黑影，一步一步移動，一步一步移動，一回兒已經走過了守衛兵的站立處，而掩入凱塞琳的寢室裏去了。</p>
<p>「小心，」甲必丹渥露夫彎着腰告訴睡在床上的皇后。「一切都預備好了，陛下，請快些。」凱塞琳從床上爬了下來。她穿着守衛兵的軍服，口裏說道：「我預備好了……怎麽我等候到不耐煩，竟睡着了。」她說着就跟着渥露夫出了寢室，跑到大廣廳裏。一個守衛來挑戰了，但是渥露夫眼明手快，一下子就把他綑綁起來了。這樣他們急速地離開了皇宮。凱塞琳跑到軍營裏，軍士認得是皇后，就立卽全體宣誓願爲她犧牲性命，并殲滅她的仇敵，大家呼着口號：「凱塞琳萬歲！沙皇死罪！」這樣他們就列隊出發了，凱塞琳騎着一匹白馬，在前面領導着。同時在敎堂裏，全體敎士們亦舉行着會議，等到凱塞琳到了，他們就全體一致擁護她爲敎會的元首。敎士們都跑着去吻她的手和足。一個敎士問道：「我們可以敲鐘了吧？全俄羅斯都在靜待着這個鐘聲哩。」凱塞琳一言不發地，自己去將那大鐘敲起來了。</p>
<p>彼得在宮裏，聽見鐘響，跳了起來。他離開寢室，走到走廊上，看見他的守衛被綑綁着，躺在地上。他喊道：「爲什麽鐘響？這是什麽意思？」黑影子裏有一個人答應道：「彼得，不久你自然會明白的。」甲必丹渥露夫很自在的走了出來。彼得一看見他，就高呌道：「你還要你的頭不要？你不知道我是皇帝嗎？」渥露夫道：「皇帝是已經没有的了。現在祇有皇后了。」他說完了，從口裂裏搯出一塊飯巾出來。彼得情知不妙，一面喊着救命，一面想逃進寢室，但是渥露夫走前一步，一個東西已經套在他的頸項裏。他立卽跪了下去，眼前一陣黑暗，他已不知人事了。渥露夫跑到彼得的寢室裏，看見伊麗沙白已是嚇得面無人色，在索索地發抖。渥露夫道：「你還不逃走，還要等着皇后的兵到，將你撕得粉碎嗎？」他說着就出來了。</p>
<p>那天是凱塞琳舉行加冕禮的日子。那知冕禮是在大禮堂裏舉行的。衆敎士高誦着讚美之歌。一位大祭士唱着：「我們的憂愁已到盡頭，我們的快樂卽將開始……你衷心的酷愛俄國，已傳聲於遐邇，所以全俄的人民，俱深盼你早登大位，解除他們的桎梏，廢除以前的一切危險政策。……現上帝及其天使，將永存於我們中間……使你的仇敵戰悚於塵埃之中……戴此皇冕之已往者，甚少光榮之君，但願你益加增進它的光輝與榮名」。說完了，他將那光輝燦爛的皇冠，加在凱塞琳頭上了。衆祭士，衆大臣等，俱一一上前，跑着去吻她的手。那憔悴得面無人色的亞萊克賽亦雜在衆人之中，畏縮得不敢上前。凱塞琳看見了，微笑着自己對着自己說道：「天下的事，誰能逆料呢？」（完）</p>

<p>Jin-Sui Army is Searching and Advancing</p>
<p>Ma Bufang's Troops Occupied Li Gang Fort</p>
<p>Sun Dianying Seems Forced to Step Down</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News, Ningxia Telegram, On the morning of the 19th, our army launched a general offensive against the enemy. The fierce battle lasted a day and night, extremely fierce. Until midnight, the enemy gradually became unsustainable and collapsed completely to the north. Our army stepped up the pursuit, killing countless enemies and capturing more than 2,000 prisoners, and obtaining a large number of spoils. The pursuit is still ongoing. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram, The Jin-Sui Army has adopted an encirclement strategy against Sun's troops. The fighting near Shizuizi is fierce. There is no report here as to whether Fu Li has left Sun's troops. Ma's troops in Ningxia have indeed launched an attack due to the Jin-Sui Army's advancing towards Shizuizi, besieging Sun's troops in Ningxia, fighting and retreating. There is a saying that they will withdraw from Li Gang Fort. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe Telegram, Sun's troops are demoralized as the Jin-Sui Army is pressing close to Shizuizi, and they cannot fight again. Originally, they planned to lead their troops to flee west, but because officers of that unit have received letters from family members staying in Sui recently, more than 1,000 in all, and have received news that the branch association has approved their reorganization, they are unwilling to flee with Sun. Seeing that the situation is over, Sun is said to be stepping down. Zhao Chengzhou personally supervised Sun Changsheng's cavalry brigade and advanced to search Shizuishan. The vanguard troops have already contacted Sun's army. Once the infantry reaches a considerable position, a fierce attack can be launched immediately. Sun's army near Ningxia's provincial capital is collapsing and retreating to Pingluo. Li Gang Fort's position has been occupied by the 2nd Division of Ma Bufang's Qing Army. Remnants of Sun's army are gathering in the Pingluo and Shizuishan area. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Baotou Telegram, The cavalry of Zhao Chengzhou's vanguard of the Jin-Sui Army has made contact with Sun's army, Wang Ying, and others in Shizuizi. It is reported that Sun has arrived near Shizuizi to command, but Sun's army lacks ammunition and has no fighting spirit. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Fu Zuoyi on the 20th, stating that the Ningxia army, together with the Gansu-Qinghai allied forces, launched a counterattack against Sun's army starting on the 19th. Yu Shiming, Ding Futing, and other troops in the suburbs of Ningyuan have contacted and surrendered one after another. Currently, the front-line troops are engaged in fierce battles with Sun's army's Liu Yueting's troops between Li Gang Fort and Pingluo. He hopes that the Jin-Sui Army will attack Shizuizi immediately in order to launch a pincer attack on Pingluo. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying, due to various considerations, is in a situation where he greatly wants to stop but cannot. Knowing that he will fail in the end, he still does not hesitate to fight like a cornered beast. The various reports in recent days are mostly smoke released by Sun's side to slow down the troops. Fu Zhan Kui, seeing that Sun is hesitating and wasting words, has left Li Gang Fort for Pingluo and is returning east in a hurry. He will report to Ping within days. In military terms, the Jin-Sui Army is urging all troops to approach Shizuizi on one hand, and is actively arranging transportation and communication on the other hand. Sun's army's Liu Yueting's troops are also rushing from Pingluo to Shizuizi to build defensive fortifications, attempting to fight the Jin-Sui Army with their backs to the city. However, the remnants of Sun's army are exhausted and cannot withstand the sharp edge of the Jin-Sui Army. Moreover, after the Ningxia armies started a flanking attack, they have already chased to Li Gang Fort, encircling and suppressing Pingluo. Sun's army will be attacked from both sides, and disintegration is imminent. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News, Sun Dianying is seeking a turnaround due to the urgent situation. The Jin-Sui Army, in order to comply with the authorities' orders, has decided to join forces with Ma's army in Pingluo. Sun's army's brigade commander, Lü Cunyi, sent a telegram to a certain party in Ping today, the 19th, explaining the process of surrender. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou Telegram, Zhu Shaoliang, considering that the Ningxia army is gathered in large numbers and urgently needs food, in addition to requisitioning 10,000 shi of military rations from grain-producing areas such as Gansu, Su, and Qingyang, also telegraphed seven counties in Qinghai, including Xining, Ledu, Datong, Minhe, Huzhu, Hualong, and Guide, to requisition 15,000 shi. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun's troops now only have two brigades, Shi Wenhua and Zhao Guozeng. His 117th Division, Ding Futing, 118th Division, Liu Yueting, 119th Division, Lu Fengnian, Supplementary Brigade, Sun Ziyu, Artillery Regiment, Liu Guangde, and other troops have all surrendered one after another in a false reorganization. Their strength has been almost completely lost. The issue of Sun leaving the army has not yet been clarified. There is news that he has arrived in Dengkou. Furthermore, the 15th Route Army's office in Beiping received a telegram on the 18th from the Ningxia communication office reporting the details of the Ningxia Chairman Ding Futing's surrender in Ningxia. Sun Dianying plundered the counties west of Sui, and the losses amounted to hundreds of thousands. The people of various counties have telegraphed the Sui Provincial Government requesting relief.

<p>Fierce Fighting Once Occurred in Taian Territory</p>
<p>(Jinan) Liu Guitang was encircled and suppressed by the cavalry regiment of Li Xuande's troops near Liangshan in the northeast of Yuncheng on the afternoon of the 21st. The battle was extremely fierce. The bandits resisted stubbornly. At dusk, the bandits collapsed and fled east. More than 100 bandits were killed, and more than 30 were captured, including three bandit battalion commanders. Sixty or seventy mules and horses were killed, and more than 50 were captured, along with two mortars, one machine gun, and more than 100 rifles. According to the captured bandits, the bandits lacked ammunition, and the mortar shells were exhausted. The bandits were very anxious. Han Fuju arrived at Dawenkou in person on the evening of the 21st to command and urged Ma Guanyi's brigade to rush forward to meet the enemy. On the morning of the 22nd, Han returned to Taian. Liu's bandits fled to the northeast of Wenshang and were fiercely suppressed by Ma's brigade, killing dozens of bandits and dozens of horses, and capturing dozens of bandits. The bandits fled to Ningyang territory and were contacted by the army, killing dozens of bandits. They were pursued to Taian territory, where a fierce battle occurred, killing more than 70 bandits. Liu's bandits suffered heavy losses and dared not cross the railway to the east. They collapsed in two directions to the west, one to Dongping and the other to Feicheng. Only seven or eight hundred bandits remained. Han ordered the Lin regiment of the 22nd Division and the cavalry regiment to pursue them to Dongping, and a part of the pistol brigade was sent to Feicheng to intercept them, and it would not be difficult to annihilate them. Han decided to return to Jinan on the 23rd. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>

The current situation is that Yin has decided to go to Yutian again on the first day of next month to handle the aftermath of the reduction and reorganization of the Yutian police team and to attend Han Dianbang's inauguration ceremony. The east Caojia Road mouth of Gubeikou has been taken over. The puppet border police team has been given a relocation fee of 500 yuan and moved outside the Great Wall.

<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Mining Bureau received a report from Tangshan on the 22nd that although the striking workers still have a stalemate intention today, the situation has eased. Some underground workers are working and draining water from the mines. All outside workers are still on strike. The workers in the Linxi, Guye, and Majiagou mines are stable and silent about the Tangshan labor strike. The Tang miners issued a declaration in the name of the Five Mines Workers' Union on the 22nd, stating the origins of the miners being abused and the police opening fire. The intention is quite fierce. The mine authorities believe that the declaration was issued by a small number of communist elements and was not truly issued by the Five Mines Workers' Union.

<h3 id="e25">Approaching US-Japan Diplomacy and the Far East (Zhen) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The diplomatic deadlock between the US and Japan seems to be gradually easing.  H. Saito's exchanges with Cordell Hull suggest a shift from the gloomy clouds over the Pacific Ocean towards clearer skies. However, Japan's three prerequisites for a compromise with the US are: (1) rejection of immigration, (2) recognition of Manchukuo, and (3) dismantling military installations in the Philippines.  Analyzing the current situation, the so-called immigration issue, even if the US were to lift discrimination against people of color, the immigration law would only allow a few hundred Japanese immigrants per year, which would not significantly benefit Japan in practice. Japan's diplomatic shrewdness makes it unlikely to fixate on empty gestures.  As for the non-recognition of Manchukuo, Hoover had already declared it during his presidency, and Roosevelt's government had repeatedly denied it at the beginning of his term. At this time, the US will definitely not lightly fall for Japan's schemes and retract its past righteous public statements. Japan likely views these two points as smokescreens to conceal its true intentions.</p>
<p>The main crux of the proposal remains the issue of naval and air installations in the Philippines.  The US considers the Philippines its base in the Far East, with close ties not only militarily but also economically. Militarily, if the US could build strong naval ports in Manila and Guam, stationing fleets and air squadrons capable of winning battles, Guam would be only 1,360 nautical miles from Yokohama, and Manila would be only 1,320 nautical miles from Sasebo naval port. Japan would face the greatest threat, while the US would suffer only superficial losses. Therefore, Japan is doing its utmost to advocate for naval parity, internally to stir up its people and externally to attract the attention of Britain and the US. At this time, the US is particularly unwilling to get involved in international disputes, lest it exacerbate domestic difficulties.  This massive naval construction plan of over a hundred ships, while not without the intention of preparing against Japan, is largely aimed at stimulating domestic industry. However, Japan cannot but be wary of this.</p>
<p>However, the economic relationship between the US and Japan is not as strained as that between Britain and Japan. Their mutual needs are also greater than those of Britain and Japan. Britain and Japan did form an alliance, but the main purpose of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance at that time was joint political action. Japan was still in the early stages of industrial development and did not yet have the ability to compete with Britain. Now, times have changed, and the Far Eastern market is almost exclusively dominated by Japan. From India to Egypt, Japanese goods have penetrated, and British goods are about to be eliminated. Therefore, the conflict between Britain and Japan is gradually intensifying. The US and Japan currently lack this type of factor. US heavy industrial products urgently need overseas markets. Japan is one of the most important consumers in the Far East. The consumption of petroleum is particularly extensive in Japan. Furthermore, Japan's raw silk has only one outlet: the US. It is no exaggeration to say that Japan's foreign trade depends on the US. Therefore, even if Japan harbors deep animosity towards the US, it cannot escape the difficulty of maintaining this economic relationship. Moreover, the current US government's policy towards Japan remains centered on economic warfare. Therefore, Japan cannot but urgently seek to transform its current precarious situation, offering the abandonment of US military installations in the Philippines as an exchange condition for naval parity. It is noteworthy that while relations between the US and Japan may improve temporarily, relations with the Soviet Union are likely to deteriorate further.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, we must conduct a deeper investigation into US-Japan relations and Japan's internal affairs. First, Japan's diplomatic policy is shifting towards moderation, not due to a change in direction by the current Saito cabinet, but because the Japanese military feels that the current international situation does not allow Japan to continue to act conspicuously. Therefore, it is seizing the opportunity to seek the US's understanding in the hope of solidifying its position in the Western Pacific. Second, from this diplomatic exchange, we can see that Japan is bound to use diplomatic moderation as a means to pursue other goals. The most urgent of these goals are (1) to deal with the Soviet Union and (2) to invade Inner Mongolia. How it will deal with the Soviet Union is not for us to discuss for now, but we must be strictly vigilant against its plot against Inner Mongolia. Our country's diplomacy today is fraught with difficulties. It is not easy to make progress, and it is not easy to maintain the status quo. Our country should not over-compromise and create a situation of timidity. I still remember that after the Boxer Rebellion, Li Hongzhang and his like only sought to patch up the aftermath and harbored an overly cautious mentality, which led the powers to act arbitrarily against China, until the fall of the Qing Dynasty before a turning point appeared. At present, our country's national strength has indeed made progress compared to the past, but the determination to adhere to a certain policy and the ability to utilize the international environment are still insufficient. Balancing US-Japan relations and Japan-Soviet relations is indeed not easy. However, by grasping reality, defining policies, not engaging in humble compromises, not refusing equal negotiations, understanding the other party's internal situation, stabilizing our own country's position, and advancing with the momentum, we may still be able to overcome the current difficulties and establish a favorable position in the international community one day.</p>

They were given a severe blow by our Li division's Tao brigade, suffering heavy casualties. They then fled to Hongqiao Cave. After being pursued by the Tao brigade, the bandits fled to the Huangjindong area of Dongmen City. Just as our Peng division arrived at Huangjindong, the Tao brigade arrived at Dongmen City, and the bandits fled to the Yangjiadong and Liuyangdong areas. We have just received news that the bandits have crossed the river south from Guandu, Liuyang. In recent days, groups of dozens or hundreds of bandits have surrendered to local militias, indicating that the Xiao and Gao bandits on the Western Route have indeed reached the final stage of their struggle. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Li Jue reported that the bandits Xiao and Gao have split up again. More than 2,000 of Xiao's bandits fled from the front of Pailou in Liudong and fled back to Yongxin via Pingbei. More than 1,000 of Gao's bandits fled to Huangjindong, Pingjiang, and are currently being pursued. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Shipowner Unwilling to Unload Cargo</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Russian cargo ship named "Lesao", carrying cargo from Leningrad to Vladivostok, ran aground on a reef on the night of the 11th of this month at a location between Hong Kong and the northern tip of the Philippine Islands because the lighthouse was not illuminated. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s tugboat attempted to tow it out three times, but failed due to the weight. It is reported that the Russian ship is carrying parts for a small cruiser, several small steamboats, and some machinery. The tugboat advised the Russian shipowner to unload some of the cargo, but the shipowner refused. The doors of all the cabins on the Russian ship are locked and no one is allowed to approach. Judging from the shipowner's intention, it seems that he would rather sacrifice the entire ship than reveal what it is carrying. A sister ship of the Russian ship is currently anchored nearby, and another Russian ship has rushed to Vladivostok to seek salvage equipment. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Japan Plans to Establish Secret Naval Base</p>
<p>(London) The government of Siam has decided to build a canal across the Kra Isthmus (this isthmus is located between Burma and the Malay Peninsula) to connect the Indian Ocean and the China Sea. According to a report in the Conservative Party's newspaper, the Daily Express, this canal is no less than the "Kiel Canal of Asia" (the Kiel Canal is located in northern Germany and connects the North Sea and the Baltic Sea). The funds are provided by Japan. This move is intended by the Japanese to counter Britain, as Britain recently decided to complete the Singapore naval base as soon as possible. The newspaper believes that Japan intends to use Siam for foreign expansion, regarding it as a base in the South Seas, etc. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) A traveling reporter for the London Daily Express telegraphed from Singapore that the Japanese are now actively seeking a suitable location for a secret naval base. The Japanese are currently negotiating to build a canal through the Kra Neck in southern Burma, so that ships docked at the secret base can avoid the Strait of Malacca between Malaysia and Sumatra. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from Brisbane, Australia, the Australian ship Mildred reported that a Japanese ship was engaged in secret work. Its crew of about 30 people was seen near Cairns on the coast of Queensland, seemingly collecting shellfish, but they did not allow anyone to approach, otherwise they would open fire. The Japanese are all carrying rifles and pistols. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Army Ministry Undertakes Large-Scale Military Reorganization</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Manchurian Incident, the Army authorities temporarily implemented the strengthening of troops stationed in Manchuria, reformed various systems, and prepared materials using funds for the current situation and military preparations. However, now that the incident has been resolved, it is planned to change the temporary measures into a permanent system. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Headquarters, the Inspectorate General of Military Education, and other top army organs are scheduled to establish a committee after the end of the Diet to study the military system reform plan. The main items to be reviewed by the committee are the "Manchukuo" national defense joint defense issue stipulated in the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, the standing army force to deal with internal and external situations, the garrison force in "Manchukuo," and other matters. It is reported that because Japan bears the important task of jointly defending "Manchukuo," it is necessary to permanently station several divisions in "Manchukuo." Therefore, the increase of the standing army force is a necessary matter to be implemented. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Ten-Nation Conference to be Held Next Year</p>
<p>To Handle All Far Eastern Problems</p>
<p>The US Will Not Lightly Show Its Hand Until the Unveiling</p>
<p>US and Japan Make Further Consultations to Improve Relations</p>
<p>(London) A Washington dispatch from the London Morning Post states that there will be no new developments in US-Japan relations until Japanese Ambassador to the US, Saito, returns to Tokyo to consult with the Japanese government. It is becoming increasingly clear that a new Pacific conference will be held at the same time as the Maritime Disarmament Conference next year. In addition to the five powers of Britain, Japan, France, Italy, and the US, China, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Russia will also participate. At that time, international problems such as the recognition of "Manchukuo" will be handled. However, the US will not show its hand until after the unveiling. The US remains indifferent to Japan's seizure of the British textile market in the Far East, because if Britain buys less US cotton, Japan will buy more. However, US rubber products and electrical appliances have recently been facing competition from Japanese goods, which the US cannot sit idly by and watch. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources today, consultations between the US and Japan regarding Pacific security and US-Japan relations, due to the exchanges between US Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota (according to yesterday's report, what Japan wants is the amendment of the US immigration law, the abandonment of US naval and air bases, and US recognition of "Manchukuo," Japan will exchange this by recognizing the current 5:5:3 naval ratio), Hirota and Hull's preliminary consultations have shown smooth progress, then Japanese Ambassador to the US Saito will prepare to have further discussions directly with Hull to seek to stabilize and improve US-Japan relations. Regarding the US abandonment of naval and air bases in the Philippines, it is widely believed that Japan is willing to guarantee the neutrality of the Philippines and will be prepared to abandon its insistence on naval parity with Britain and the US at the fourth naval conference to be held in 1935, and is willing to maintain the originally stipulated 5:5:3 naval ratio limit. This move is intended to dispel outside fears of a naval race and dispel the clouds of war in the Pacific. If the US-Japan negotiations in the US are successful, then the US and Japan may conclude a non-aggression treaty. (National News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) US newspapers and key figures in Congress have unanimously expressed their appreciation for the report on the consultations between Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and US Secretary of State Hull, and see this as a ray of hope for the development of the Pacific situation, and the reconciliation of disputes between the US and Japan may be led by this. A spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in an interview with the Associated Press, praised the exchanges between Hull and Hirota, believing that the US will discuss the differences between the two countries with an attitude of candor and sincerity. Republican leader Borah, known for his expertise in diplomacy, also said of the US-Japan consultations that it was like hearing the music of heaven, which was indeed pleasing to the ear, but what kind of impact it would have on the naval arms race was the touchstone of the recent consultations between the two countries. Senator Robinson said that if the consultations led to peace, he would also support them. According to government sources, the initiation of the consultations was by the US and not Japan, especially with regard to proposals to increase and maintain friendship between the two countries. Observers believe that all countries related to the Far East should participate in the US-Japan discussions. It is also said that in the reply, the US stated that the solution to the Pacific problem must be bound by existing treaties, because this is a multilateral issue rather than a purely US-Japan bilateral issue. Although there is much speculation here about the act of recognizing "Manchukuo," it is believed that the US may not take this step without the participation of China and the Soviet Union. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Public Voice Forum published an editorial stating that the exchange of letters between the US Secretary of State and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota is sufficient to show that the friendship between the two countries has been placed on a solid foundation, and the doubts held by the Japanese regarding the purpose of the US Far Eastern policy may be dispelled by the publication of these two letters. The newspaper also stated that opinions from well-informed sources in Japan also know that the US naval construction plan, aimed at reaching the treaty limit, does not mean changing the situation in the Pacific. On the contrary, this is merely a precaution. Only in this way can the US stand on an equal footing with Britain and Japan at the upcoming naval conference. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared that he believes that the US and Japan should hold preliminary talks on naval affairs before the Washington Naval Conference of 1935, and that the current ratio of naval forces between Britain, the US, and Japan should be maintained. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Japanese Ambassador to the US Saito, as a result of US-Japan friendship, the US may abandon its policy of rejecting the immigration of Japanese people to the US, which is greatly dissatisfied with by the Japanese people. Saito also said that he was very pleased to learn that the major powers are willing to follow the US's lead and no longer restrict the entry of Japanese people. He said that he does not want to force countries to amend their laws, as this matter is purely in the hands of the national parliaments. Saito also said that if the US can change its attitude, the Japanese people will benefit greatly and will deeply appreciate the kindness and fairness of the American people, and the friendship between the two countries will be greatly enhanced. This approach is not only a desire of Japan, but also an established policy. As for the foreign trade of Britain and the US, it may become an all-out battle in the future. Saito said that this was inaccurate, because Britain and the US are relatively good customers of each other, and the same is true in the Pacific, because the US and Japan are also relatively good customers of each other. Finally, Saito also dismissed rumors of an imminent Russo-Japanese war as unfounded. (National News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) The natural result of the exchange of letters between US Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota will be the US's recognition of "Manchukuo." All British newspapers, regardless of their party affiliation, answer this question in the affirmative. The Morning Post, which has always been known for its strong advocacy of British-Japanese friendship, even takes the actions on the other side of the Atlantic as a model and earnestly urges the British cabinet to give it deep consideration. The Conservative Party newspaper said that the Washington government's recognition of the puppet empire in the near future is inevitable. Former Secretary of State Stimson's doctrine of non-recognition is like an idol that has been destroyed, and President Roosevelt is the first to worship this idol. Therefore, Britain has no choice but to wander alone by the shores of Lake Leman, holding on to the remnants of the so-called non-recognition doctrine, adhering to its service unswervingly. The US, which had previously exhausted its efforts to isolate Japan, has now changed its attitude and abandoned this dangerous political error. Therefore, the Japanese, who held an unfair feeling that the US policy was like throwing poison and leaving a great disaster in the Pacific, have been comforted. This is undoubtedly gratifying. Another Conservative Party newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, although not taking such a stance, also believes that if the US can obtain guarantees for the open door and economic concessions in the eastern provinces, it may abandon its policy of non-recognition in exchange. However, it believes that the White House will not rashly follow this path without first seeking the opinion of the League of Nations "Committee on Non-Recognition of Manchukuo." The Liberal Party newspaper, the News Chronicle, while firmly believing that the Washington government will work hard to get the Chinese government to recognize it on its own, also believes that Japan may abandon its demands on naval tonnage ratios at the 1935 Disarmament Conference as an exchange condition.

<p>Amendment Returned to the Senate</p>
<p>(Washington) The House today rejected the Senate's amendment to the $500 million naval expansion bill and returned the bill to the Senate for further discussion of differences. The bill stipulates a large-scale program for building warships and aircraft. It was passed by the Senate with some amendments on March 6. The amendments include: (1) profits obtained by private contractors may not exceed 10 percent, (2) the government should only manufacture one-quarter of the 1,000 aircraft originally stipulated in the plan. Republican Senator Nye has criticized the bill as a grandiose statement and a bill aimed at rescuing workers manufacturing weapons, saying that the bill will increase the nation's burden by $100 million, as the bill stipulates the construction of six cruisers, thirty submarines, sixty-five destroyers, and one aircraft carrier over five years.

<p>Naval Program Does Not Exceed Treaty Limits</p>
<p>Expressing Willingness to Strive to Maintain the Authority of the League of Nations</p>
<p>(London) Today, British Prime Minister MacDonald delivered cautionary remarks in the House of Commons, defending the increase in naval, land, and air force expenditures, saying that Britain's current consideration of armaments is not intended to harm other countries, but to meet its own national defense needs. Britain's desire to limit armaments by treaty is for this reason. Now, in order to reduce danger, it is necessary to do so, but Britain still trusts treaties. Britain's naval program strictly does not exceed the scope of the naval treaty. However, the government must increase its tools to protect civilians and defend against aerial attacks. This kind of danger may not materialize for the time being, but it cannot be ignored, because even a slight negligence will have terrible consequences. Britain's only aim is peace based on international cooperation and the League of Nations. If the League of Nations is used well, it is the only mechanism to achieve this goal. Therefore, the British government will strive to maintain the authority of the League of Nations. Lord President of the Council Baldwin, speaking to conclude the defense debate, said that the method of international management of civil aviation to eliminate the harm of aerial attacks is impossible. He had suggested this method two years ago to seek a solution. The government immediately studied the matter and planned measures. Drafts were repeatedly changed, taking a lot of time, but after painstaking efforts, it still felt that it could not get a satisfactory solution, and no other country had put forward any plan that could be implemented or could solve this problem.

<p>More Than a Thousand Dead and Injured, Material Losses of 100 Million</p>
<p>Aomori At 6:50 pm on the 21st, a chimney in a bathhouse in Sumiyoshi Town, Hakodate City, suddenly caught fire. At that time, a strong wind of 30 meters was already raging, and in an instant, it spread to the entire city. More than 60 towns including Aoyagi, Akebono, Bunken, Aioi, and Kotobuki Town were all reduced to ashes. The cries of women were unbearable to hear. Due to the disruption of communication organs, the details are unknown. At 4:30 am on the 22nd, it was still burning. According to a report from the Sapporo Railway Bureau received by the Ministry of Railways, there were more than 1,000 deaths and injuries, and approximately 24,500 households were burned. (Dentsu, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tsuruga According to Wakasa Radio, a telegram was received at 6:40 am this morning stating that Hakodate City has been 80% destroyed. The wind is gradually weakening, there are 150,000 victims, and there are many deaths and injuries, which are difficult to count. Another telegram stated that the Hakodate fire was extinguished at 7:00 am this morning. (Nichi-Ren, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 7:12 pm today, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced the following damages from the Hakodate fire: 23,600 households destroyed, a disaster-stricken population of 92,000, 650 deaths, 460 injuries, and 32 shelters with a total of 27,000 people. (Dentsu, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a message sent by the Sapporo Broadcasting Station at 8:10 pm this afternoon, more than 140,000 Hakodate refugees are being housed in 32 places such as elementary schools, and are only given three meals a day. The refugees are suffering from hunger and cold, and women and children are especially pitiful. According to news received by the Wakasa Radio Telegraph Office, the losses suffered in this fire alone have reached 30 million yen for various insurance companies. If each household is counted at 500 yen, it exceeds 100 million yen. The army, navy, Ministry of Home Affairs, and Ministry of Railways have all increased their rescue teams. It is reported that the consulates and commercial agencies of Britain, Russia, and China are safe and sound. (Hua-Lian, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the damage from the Hakodate city fire is estimated to be no less than 20 million yen. Japanese fire insurance companies all consider Hakodate to be the most dangerous place. Assuming that the insurance premiums for this fire are 10 million yen, it accounts for half of the average annual expenditure of 20 million yen for national insurance companies. The largest record of insurance payments in Japan, apart from the Kanto earthquake, was 6 million yen during the Osaka fire 18 years ago. During the fire at the Shirokiya department store in Tokyo the year before last, the Daito and Nissho companies paid 2.3 million yen in insurance, leading to bankruptcy. After the news of the Hakodate fire was released, various insurance companies were panicked. (Nichi-Ren, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of the Navy received a telegram for help from the governor of Hokkaido last night. Navy Minister Osumi immediately mobilized the First Destroyer Division to dispatch. It is reported that four Japanese warships, including the Kamikaze, were ordered to sail to Hakodate this morning. The army also sent Type 88 reconnaissance aircraft to fly over Hakodate to investigate the disaster situation and report to various agencies to facilitate relief. According to a report from the Tsugaru Fortress Command, the important organs of the Hakodate Army have not been burned as of this morning, but the army officers' dormitory has been completely destroyed. (Hua-Lian, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Wakasa Wireless Radio Station on the outskirts of Hakodate City to Tokyo, the Hakodate fire, fanned by strong winds, continued until 5:30 am today, burning two-thirds of the city's 40,000 households before it was extinguished. Only Benten Town and Suehiro Town have not been completely burned. The entire city is now a vast expanse. Even the famous Goryokaku has been burned. As of 4:00 am today, approximately 24,500 households have been burned, more than 1,000 people have been killed or injured, and 150,000 victims have been left homeless, standing in the wilderness, suffering from hunger and cold. The scene is too terrible to describe. Important buildings that have been burned include the city hall, such as the Jitsugyo High School, Girls' High School, Nishihonganji Betsuin Temple, Broadcasting Station, Postal Bureau, Elementary School, Hakodate Shimbun, Hakodate Mainichi Shimbun, various government offices, etc. However, the consulates of various countries are located on the hillside and have been spared. The cause of the fire was that the chimney of the Sumiyoshi Town bathhouse was blown down by the wind, causing the fire. At that time, the southeast wind in Hakodate was strong, and the wind speed was still 30 meters at 5:00 am. The fire from the chimney was fanned by the wind and spread very quickly in an instant. In addition, the submarine cable also experienced an obstacle due to the strong wind at 11:00 pm last night, and communication was impossible, completely cutting off direct contact with Aomori City. Originally, Hakodate City was famous for fires, and burning 500 or 600 households was not considered a major fire, but the most recent record was 2,140 households burned on April 14, 1922, with losses of 18.5 million yen. However, compared to this fire, it pales in comparison. The total fire insurance amount in Hakodate City reaches more than 30 million yen, so insurance companies are panicking. Also, the Hakodate Fortress Command and the barracks of the heavy artillery unit seem to be safe. (Dentsu, 22nd)</p>
<p>Hakodate The Hakodate fire spread very quickly due to the strong wind and fierce fire. The victims had no time to take out all their property from their homes and flocked to Omori Beach for refuge, just like the clothing factory during the Tokyo earthquake. Omori Beach was also burned, and those who fled had nowhere to go. Some were burned to death, and some drowned in the sea. It was like Avici hell, and it was unbearable to witness. Therefore, there were many deaths in that area. In addition, all the prisoners in the Hakodate Prison were also released. The scope of the fire was three cho (more than 1,000 feet) wide and one and a half ri long. The losses are difficult to estimate. (Dentsu, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) To rescue the Hakodate fire disaster, at 2:35 pm today, the Ministry of Railways specially opened a rescue train from Ueno Station in the city. Director Haneda of the Social Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs and other officials, nurses, and other rescue teams, as well as 720 news reporters, departed on this train and rushed to Aomori City, and then took a boat from Aomori to Hakodate to rescue the victims, scheduled to arrive in Hakodate City tomorrow afternoon. (Hua-Lian, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from the Hokkaido Prefectural Office to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Hakodate fire is beyond salvage. The victims are extremely exhausted in the wind and rain. The government first purchased 6,000 bags of rice and mobilized youth groups and rural soldiers to cook outdoors to provide emergency relief. Martial law was declared throughout the city, and troops and police officers were ordered to maintain order and provide relief to the victims. They also sought help from the army and navy to cooperate in fighting the fire and disaster relief. The Ministry of Railways also compiled an emergency train to evacuate the refugees, and the entire city has become a field of rubble. (Hua-Lian, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The entire city of Hakodate was swallowed by flames. The authorities released the local prison this morning. The prisoners went out and acted recklessly. Having suffered a major disaster and being disturbed by prisoners, people were very panicked, presenting an increasingly chaotic and volatile scene. The Hakodate Heavy Artillery Brigade, seeing the seriousness of the situation, has also been fully mobilized to assist the police in enforcing martial law, but it is not enough to cope. The 5th Infantry Regiment of Aomori sent 60 people this afternoon, and the 8th Division of Hirosaki sent 100 people to the city. The Asahikawa Division is also preparing to send troops to assist.

<p>(Tokyo) Since the morning of the 21st, Japan has been attacked by strong winds across the country, with a wind speed of 20 meters. The damage has spread throughout the country. The Kan-Fu connection route, the Inland Sea-Kyushu route, the Kanmon connection ship, and others have all been suspended. In the Ishikawa Prefecture area, more than 500 houses in Daishoji Town were flooded, embankments collapsed, and bridges were washed away. In Taiwan, three fishing boats were overturned off the coast of Keelung, eight people were rescued, and seven people were missing. Near Tokyo, at the Yaguchi Ferry on the Tama River, all 120 gravel boats were also suspended. In the Ibaraki Prefecture area, the school building of the Yunosawa Village Elementary School in Makabe County and the newly built school building of the Taniida Village Elementary School in Tsukuba County were both blown down. The number of telegram and telephone damage accidents is even innumerable. The triumphal arch in Hirosaki City was destroyed. The wind speed in Aomori City was 25 meters, and in addition, snow was melting, and many houses were flooded. (Dentsu, 22nd)</p>

The case is that the government is authorized to buy silver at a price higher than the market price for foreign debts to pay for surplus American agricultural products. However, the government is indifferent to it. Because of the cold attitude of the White House, the entire battle for silver legislation has now gradually subsided. Silver leaders are also preparing to make concessions and accept amendments. All silver bills, stipulating a gold-silver ratio of 16 to 1, such as the Weiler and Fessinger bills, have very little hope of passing in this session of Congress. (Guomin Dian, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Roosevelt Tries to Curb the Strike Wave <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, President Roosevelt held the first meeting with leaders of both labor and management. The president's effort this time is to try to curb the national strike wave. There are more than 60 groups across the country currently brewing strikes, and approximately 35,000 workers are involved in the strikes, including thousands of bus drivers in New York and 6,000 shoemakers in Harvard. The rumored strikes in the automotive and railway industries are even more serious. The strike situation of 200,000 textile workers in the western United States is also continuing to increase. The workers in the steel industry are also unstable, and the blood-wolf gate strike on the west coast is also on the verge of breaking out. President Luo cautiously stated his personal position and said that he would use all his power to prevent strikes in the automobile industry and reduce the instability of workers in other places. Today, President Roosevelt issued an article at the White House after a meeting with a committee representing automobile industry employers, saying that the president has examined the strike situation from the employer's point of view, and tomorrow will meet with leaders of automobile industry workers. American Federation of Labor President Green was also invited to attend tomorrow's meeting at the White House. Automakers did not offer any criticism of today's meeting, but according to Labor Secretary Lobo of the Automobile Industry Chamber of Commerce, the meeting showed obvious progress. Also, the president has no intention of promoting the approach between labor and management under the current situation. The president's actions must be taken after understanding what concessions both labor and management will make. Today, the American Federation of Labor stated that it could temporarily postpone the request for workers to elect representatives to negotiate with employers as a group and organize workers' grievance groups. The Railway Workers Union has accepted the mediation proposal of Federal Transport Facilitator Esben to resolve the railway industry wage dispute, which is a good sign in the railway industry strike brewing. However, under the current situation, the union side is generally unwilling to have any negotiations with representatives of the railway authorities. Today, Gormen, vice chairman of the Textile Workers Union, told the Senate Workers Committee that 200,000 textile workers are angry and preparing to strike because employers have jointly refused to recognize their union. Senator General Bora attacked the combination of industrialists and condemned them for being greedy and responsible for the entire labor unrest. Bora also demanded that the government take action to prevent various illegal monopolies by industrialists. (Guomin Dian, 21st)</p>

<p>If War Breaks Out in Europe</p>

<p>Prague There are rumors in the Czech capital that during the Rome Conference, the prime ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary signed a military agreement in addition to various treaties.

<p>Except for the Economic Cooperation Little Agreement</p>
<p>Czech Foreign Minister Believes it is a Source of Disaster</p>
<p>Budapest Czech Foreign Minister Benes gave a speech on the Austrian issue to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives yesterday, saying that there are four solutions to the Austrian issue, and that the Czech government is prepared to participate in various discussions so as to reopen commercial negotiations with Hungary in the near future. Recently, the Czech government made a formal request to Hungary to start negotiations, first to establish a temporary agreement, and then to conclude a commercial treaty. The political and economic circles here were quite surprised to hear this. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Prague Czech Foreign Minister Benes gave his long-awaited speech today at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the two Houses of Congress. Mr. Benes expressed deep concern about the future war in Europe, and still adhered to his firm attitude towards the consistency of the current situation in Europe. Therefore, he opposed the revision of the peace treaty on the one hand, and repeatedly stated his difficulty in turning a blind eye to the merger of Germany and Austria on the other. Mr. Benes first discussed the previously proposed German-Austrian customs union. He said that the combination had created economic, political and psychological errors. However, the merger of Germany and Austria today is more dangerous than before, and the idea of ​​his suggestion is also different from before, because its purpose is to spread its national social movement widely within Europe, so that a kind of refined association can be achieved between the two countries in order to achieve the final political integration.</p>
<p>This kind of change, in the eyes of Mr. Benes, will inevitably cause a major conflict in the European political situation, but fortunately, he knows that Italy, France, Britain and other related countries will never make the slightest concession to the necessity of maintaining Austria's independence and integrity. Even if Austria temporarily becomes a national socialist country, it will not change its position. Mr. Benes then extended his condolences to Germany, saying that although Germany cannot implement its policy of merger, there is still considerable compensation, that is, Austria must not merge with any political and economic organization to oppose Germany. The current Austrian problem can only be solved by the joint agreement of Rome, Paris, Berlin and the Little Entente countries. However, if the current chaotic situation continues to exist, it will inevitably cause major disputes in the future, because the previous war was caused in Serbia, and the future war may originate in Austria. Mr. Benes did not say that the various principles and obligations of the Geneva Treaty of 1922 concerning the Austrian issue should be fully recognized by all relevant countries, and should not be limited to the four signatory countries. As for the recent Rome Three-Power Conference, Mr. Benes adopted a cautious attitude. He said that the Little Entente countries may not fully agree with Italy's enthusiasm for solving the Danube River basin problem, but his final judgment must wait for the Rome agreement to be specified in the future, and its legal, political and economic effects will be obvious before it can be decided. Furthermore, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini once stated that the establishment of the Rome Agreement did not conflict with the interests of the Little Entente countries. Mr. Benes expressed his welcome to this, but unfortunately, the possibility of the Little Entente countries being added has been reduced by Mussolini's subsequent declaration (Guomin Dian, 22nd).</p>

<p>(Nanjing) French Chargé d'Affaires Herbineau said that the rumor that various countries have recognized the puppet state of Manchukuo is a rumor. The French government still adheres to the main points of the League of Nations' handling of the incident, and has never intended to recognize the puppet organization, and its attitude has not changed in the slightest. As for the French investment, I have not heard of it. According to my speculation, the French government will never have such a move. As for the French merchants, although the government cannot prohibit their overseas investment, judging from the reason, this will not happen. Regarding the Sino-French Vietnamese commercial treaty, after several consultations between Welles and your Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the two sides have failed to reach an agreement on the issues of tariffs and taxation of foreign rice. I have not been assigned the task of discussing this matter this time. In the future, Ambassador Welles will come to China and set a policy again. (Special Telegraph, 22nd)</p>

One robber jumped into the counter and took more than 10,000 yuan in deposits from the cashier's department. When the robbers were robbing, Xie Fusheng, the accounting director of the bank, entered from the outside. Fearing that he would escape, the robbers fired a shot. Xie dodged the bullet and fell to the ground. The guard Yuan Zhen heard the sound and came to see what was happening. Seeing the situation, he fled out and shouted for arrest.

<p>Li Shouxin Assumes Position as Commander of the Puppet Chahar Garrison</p>
<p>Japanese Army Personnel, Yuan Ye, Organize Investigation Group to Enter Mongolia</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Japanese troops in eastern Chahar claim that the 8th Division and 7th Division are exchanging deployments in Guyuan and Duolun. However, the 7th Division has successively arrived in the Duozhan area, numbering nearly 1,000 men, while there has been no news of the departure of the 8th Division units originally stationed there. According to recent reports, the headquarters of the Japanese 10th Division has decided to establish itself in Duolun, and the entire division will be stationed in the Duo-Gu area. In addition, there are more than 9,000 men of the puppet army under Li Shouxin, who has assumed the position of Commander of the Puppet Eastern Chahar Garrison. Duolun is an important town in eastern Chahar and a transportation hub between Rehe and Chahar. The Japanese side's gathering of a large army to station in that area certainly has major intentions. The plan is roughly centered on Duolun, developing southward from the second and fourth districts of Guyuan (i.e., the seat of Xinyuan County), and northward from Duolun through the Su-Zhi-Pang-Jiang area of the Xilin Gol League, directly threatening Ude in the Chechen Khanate of Outer Mongolia. Ude is a transportation hub between Inner and Outer Mongolia and is especially a necessary route to Kulun. The arrival of the Japanese army there can cut off Sino-Russian transportation and threaten the Soviet Union. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province, especially accompanied Xiao Zhenying of the Military Commission to the Ju Ren Tang to meet with He Yingqin at 9:00 AM yesterday to report on the issue of the increased Japanese troops in eastern Chahar and requested instructions on how to deal with it. He stated that he had asked the Political Readjustment Council to be responsible for negotiating with the Japanese side to withdraw the troops. Furthermore, Qin Dechun, in response to Song's telegram, arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou by fast train at 9:30 AM yesterday. At noon yesterday, he accompanied Song and Huang Fu to a banquet and discussed diplomatic issues in Chahar Province. Song, Qin, and Xiao will stay in Beiping for a few days, and will return to Zhangjiakou after the defense of eastern Chahar has been arranged.</p>
<p>According to news from important Mongolian figures, the Japanese army's invasion of Chahar is aimed at Western Mongolia. On the 7th of this month, Japanese Lieutenant General Yuan Ye organized a so-called "Mongolia Investigation Group" in Changchun. A total of twelve people participated, including one descendant of the Qing Dynasty, two Japanese army strategists, three Japanese geographers, and three Mongolian staff members. They traveled from Changchun through Taonan and Rehe to the Xilin Gol League and Ulanqab League. It is estimated that they have now arrived in eastern Chahar. (March 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e92">Yang Jie's Letter Reporting on Italian Military Affairs <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Highly Praising the Completeness of Italian Military Affairs</p>
<p>And Deeply Admiring Mussolini as a Person</p>
<p>Yang Jie, President of the Army University, has been inspecting military affairs in various European and American countries for nearly three months. Yesterday, Zhang Qiazhong, Director of Education at the Central Military Academy, received a letter from Yang from Berlin, describing in detail his observations of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Party Army, engineering projects, aviation industry, automobile industry, shipbuilding industry, etc. in Rome and other places. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>My respects to Mr. Wenbai,</p>
<p>It has been two months since we parted in the capital. I miss our old friendship deeply. I arrived in Rome at 9:00 AM on December 9th of last year. Before unpacking, I was guided by Liu Wendao, the Minister to Italy, and representatives from the Italian military to begin the inspection according to Mussolini's scheduled itinerary. The first place shown to me was the world-renowned Air Force Department. Afterwards, I met with Mussolini, the intention being to give me the deepest impression. From the 9th to the 11th, I was in Rome. On the 12th, I was in Terni. On the 13th, I was in Livorno. On the 14th, I was in La Spezia. On the 15th, I was in Genoa. On the 16th, I was in Turin. On the 18th and 19th, I was in Milan and Brescia. I spent a total of eleven days in Italy, studying all aspects of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Party Army, and military industries. I obtained a wealth of material. I left Italy at 12:00 PM on the 19th, stayed in Geneva for a day to visit the League of Nations, and arrived in Berlin on the 22nd. On January 8th of this year, I continued my work. Except for the observations at the League of Nations, which were irrelevant to military affairs, and the inspection of Germany, which is not yet completed, I will briefly present my observations in Italy below:</p>
<p>The Italian military is centered on the royal family and based on the Fascist Party. The relationship between superiors and subordinates is one of solemnity and kindness, while subordinates show respect and love for their superiors. The superiors have a way to command, and the subordinates understand the meaning of obedience. The spirit is vigorous, and the actions are swift. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are divided into three parts. The Army is divided into thirteen military districts and thirty division districts. Officer training is carried out in specialized military universities and schools, with the Minister responsible for everything.</p>
<p>The Navy is divided into four coastal defense sectors, each with a commander-in-chief responsible for their respective areas. Talent is cultivated by the Naval Academy, the Naval Junior School, the Naval Senior Class, and Naval University students, directly under the Minister of the Navy.</p>
<p>The Air Force is divided into three air territory zones and three auxiliary zones. Part of its forces belong to the Army, Navy, and colonies, but the majority is directly under the Air Force Department. The establishment of talent and all organizational construction are under the full responsibility of the Minister of the Air Force. Regarding education, there are Air Force Universities for fighter, reconnaissance, bombing, air force weaponry, air force mechanics, and military training teams, etc.</p>
<p>The Party Army is a special organization, subordinate to the Party, responsible for training young people within the Party. There is a Party Army organization in every city, town, and village in the country. Important cities also have Party Army camps. The scale and equipment are no different from those of the regular army. The current commander-in-chief of the Party Army is an army lieutenant colonel. It is said that if there is a personnel change one day, he will return to his original position as a lieutenant colonel to perform his duties.</p>
<p>The armaments industry also has its merits. Its aviation industry is thriving. The most unique aspect nationwide is that it has achieved self-sufficiency. Aircraft manufacturers include Caproni, Fiat-Breda, and other factories. Among them, Caproni's reputation is particularly well-known domestically. However, due to a lack of light metal resources, they are forced to continue using wood. However, wood is far cheaper than metal, and its use is also a way to solve difficulties. All types of aircraft manufactured by each factory must first be sent to the National Aircraft Testing Ground to check their performance before they are allowed to be replicated or used. As for the new models built by the Air Force Department, the completeness of pneumatic and electrical equipment is unparalleled in the world, and the large number of aircraft is also impressive. The automobile industry is also booming throughout Italy. Fiat alone produces an average of 150 vehicles per day during peacetime and up to 350 vehicles during wartime. Its eight-wheeled large vehicles can accommodate as many as eighty passengers on just one level. In addition, snow transport vehicles, mountain climbing vehicles, tractors, and tanks are also quite developed, but they cannot be compared with the aviation industry. As for the shipbuilding industry, Italy's territory is mostly coastal, so its importance is natural. However, the recent trend is not to focus on maximum tonnage but on maximum speed. The improvement of ship shapes is being studied in great depth. Various types of ships are navigated in the water tank of the testing ground, and the resistance of water is measured mechanically to find the ship type with the least resistance. According to experts, the results obtained after the ship shape improvement are better than simply increasing horsepower, and the speed is even higher in certain situations. In addition, the construction of docks, shipyards, and wharves seeks to be both high-quality and low-cost. The two wharves in La Spezia are solid in content and beautiful in appearance, unmatched in the modern world. This is also a successful construction since Mussolini came to power. Regarding the manufacture of guns, cannons, bullets, etc., since the Great War, the working capacity has been reduced by three-quarters. Gun factories produce various automatic rifles, machine guns, anti-aircraft machine guns, grenade launchers, and various bullets. Its grenade launcher can also be used as a rifle. Its breech and those used by automatic rifles are very short, and the caliber is also less than 7 mm. This is to write about its unique features. The cannons produced by the cannon factory generally have a barrel length of 53 times the caliber. The shells produced by the shell factory during peacetime are entirely electroplated with lead on the surface, which does not rust and is easy to store. In addition, metallurgy factories and light metal factories are not behind other countries.</p>
<p>Italy, once the ancient Roman Empire during its golden age, has been languishing for more than three thousand years. Compared with our China, it can be said that both are peerless. Since Mussolini came to power in 1922, Italy, which had been weak and sick for years and going against the tide, has suddenly become one of the five powers, and recently has even shown a leading force. The reasons for this cannot be ignored. In the distant East, I have heard that Mussolini's dictatorship over the Party and the country is extreme, and he handles all affairs as he wishes. I thought that such an overwhelming approach would inevitably create enemies and accumulate resentment among the people. However, after arriving in Italy and carefully observing the hearts of the people, I realized that regardless of men, women, old, and young, they all regard Mussolini as a deity and are reluctant to call him by his name directly. Mussolini's smile is considered joyful by everyone, and Mussolini's anger is considered enraging by everyone. The joys and sorrows of the whole country are tied to one person. This is because Mussolini dedicates himself to the Party and the country, is selfless, and strives to strengthen the country. Therefore, he would rather take power by force to seek peace for the country, so he does not hesitate to humble himself to the Pope. From this, it can be seen that if one reaches the realm of "the world is for all," even if everything is dictatorial, people will still love and support them without hesitation. As for developing rural areas without favoring cities, vigorously building the country with the air force, and intensifying youth training, all have a unique vision and are related to the foundation of the country. As for the Fascist Party, it is extremely strict. The Party Army is only for Party members, and Party members are only limited to those who joined the Party from a young age and are not allowed to participate in middle age. Therefore, the Fascist Party has ruled Italy for ten years, and it is still vigorous and has no signs of corruption. According to Party records in 1934, Fascism, except for Soviet Russia, which is always at odds, has a tendency to be adopted by countries around the world. My words are rambling and I do not care if they are vulgar. I hope you will give me your advice.</p>
<p>With respect, I wish you well.</p>
<p>Yang Jie respectfully bows. (February 1st, Zhengqi Society)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Sichuan Army Launches General Offensive on Tongjiang <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Second Phase of the Annihilation Plan for Recovering Bazhong is Completed</p>
<p>He Chengjun Completes the Deployment of Military Defense and Returns to Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence: Since the Sichuan bandit suppression army began the second phase of its general annihilation campaign, all routes have made progress. However, due to the rugged mountain roads and the varying distances, the bandit forces are elusive, and the advance is uneven. Recently, Liu Xiang ordered a full-scale offensive on all fronts, advancing towards designated targets, and taking the recovery of Bazhong as the completion of the second phase of the plan. Once the dangerous points in the Enyang River area are recovered and Bazhong County is under the control of the National Army, Xu Bandit, unable to resist the momentum, led his main force, carrying baggage, to retreat to Tongjiang. Bazhong was then captured on the 18th by the Second Route Army Tian Songyao and the Third Route Army Li Qixiang. Thus, only Tongjiang and Nanzhang counties remain in the Red Area of northern Sichuan. Liu Xiang praised the efforts of the various armies in the annihilation campaign and telegraphed awards, ordering the First Route Army to attack Mumen, open the northern road, and contact the Second, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Routes to take Tongjiang directly, setting a deadline for the capture. However, Xu Bandit has built many solid fortifications in Tongjiang, and his main force is concentrated here, so he is bound to put up a final stubborn resistance. It is expected that the National Army's annihilation campaign will have even more fierce battles. Liu Xiang recently sent a telegram to Hankou, reporting the progress of the battle to the Wuchang Headquarters and the Hankou Pacification Headquarters, stating that Xu Bandit, Chen Changhao, and others, due to their inability to support themselves, once held a meeting to decide to concentrate all their strength and launch a fierce attack on our Fifth Route Army, hoping to break through the encirclement and flee to the Kuiwan River area of Sichuan and Hubei. Unexpectedly, the attacks over two weeks were all defeated, and the foundation of the Soviet area was shaken. The bandits, struggling to cope, moved important resources to Tongjiang. The elite of the bandits have been wiped out by more than half, and their forces have been dispersed, making it easy to annihilate them. It is said that the bandits are trying to hold Tongjiang to maintain their power in Sichuan, and are also preparing to harass the border areas of Shaanxi, Hubei, and Henan. The four famous local bandits in Henan Province, Wang You, Xiao Liushao, Gu Desheng, and Yang Xiaohei, have recently been incited by the bandits to unite in southern Henan and attempt to flee to northern Hubei as the vanguard of the bandits. Wang, Xiao, Yang, and Gu have a strength of no less than 4,000 people, and are familiar with the terrain, which is enough to disrupt the National Army's line. Therefore, Xu Bandit is eager to take advantage of them. However, Wang You's force has recently been completely eliminated by the National Army. Wang Bandit himself only managed to escape with his life. Yang Xiaohei's force was also eliminated after Wang's force, and Yang was captured alive by the National Army. Xiao and Gu have only a few hundred people and can hardly survive. Therefore, Xu Bandit's plan to build a new stronghold has suffered an initial blow. As for the defense of northern Hubei, He Chengjun has completed the deployment. He stayed in Xiangfan for six days, inspecting the garrison troops, inspecting the bunker projects, and instructing the generals on the measures to prevent Xu Bandit. He was very busy. Now that the deployment has been completed, he ended his trip to Yunyang and started his return to Hankou from Fancheng on the afternoon of the 21st. He is scheduled to inspect the local garrison troops in Zaoyang, Suixian, Yingshan, and Anlu, and will not arrive in Hankou until the 23rd. He will then prepare a fundamental plan to suppress the bandits and telegraph it to Chairman Chiang for approval. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Shandong Provincial Army Launches Large-Scale Encirclement and Annihilation of Liu Bandit <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>More Than 20,000 Troops and Militiamen Mobilized</p>
<p>More Than 1,000 of Liu's Bandits are Surrounded in Yuncheng</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence: Liu Guitang's forces were divided into two groups, attempting to flee to the Yuncheng area. The armies are intercepting them separately. Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division, has moved from Jining to Juye to command. Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 20th Division and commander of the Lunan Garrison, is commanding everything in Yanzhou. According to reports, Liu's forces total more than 2,000 people, with 21 machine guns, 8 mortars, and 1 radio. However, ammunition is very scarce. Handgun bullets are the most, but each gun has less than 100 rounds, so they dare not open fire with the government army. The telephone line between Dingtao and Cao County was cut by Liu's forces on the 18th and restored on the 19th. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, originally planned to go to Yanzhou early on the 19th to command, but the situation eased, so he temporarily suspended the plan. The special train is still stationed, waiting for orders. Fearing that Liu's forces would cross the Jinpu Railway to the east via the Dawenkou area and return to the old nest in the mountains of southern Shandong, Han ordered Zhan Shutang, commander of the 80th Division, to lead the directly subordinate battalions and companies and Tang Bangzhi's 241st Brigade to open up the Dawenkou Nanyi area for defense. Dai Hongbin, commander of the armored train, took three armored trains to patrol back and forth between Tai'an and Lincheng to prevent Liu's forces from destroying the railway. The Ma Guanyi Brigade of the 74th Division stationed in Dezhou had already passed through Jinan on the 19th. Han Fuju often used the phone to command the armies, and said that if Liu's forces passed through the defense zone and the officers and soldiers were not injured, it would be due to ineffective interception and annihilation, and they should be held responsible.</p>
<p>Also, according to reports from the front, it is said that Liu's forces of more than 1,000 people fled from Henan to Zhongdi Quan, 18 li southwest of Cao County on the morning of the 17th. In the afternoon, they were severely attacked by Wu Yuanxing's regiment of the 58th Brigade of the 20th Division, Liu Ying's third-way militia regiment of Gu Liangyou's forces, and the Cao County militia. When they tried to flee back to Henan, Tan Zixin's cavalry chased them from behind. In desperation, they fled north to Weiwanji, 35 li west of Cao County on the 18th. Wu Yuanxing's regiment followed and chased north. The first and second battalions of Gu Liangyou's militia regiment in Zhuanmiao were coming from the north, and both sides attacked in unison. In this battle, more than 200 of Liu's forces were killed. At night, Liu's forces fled east through Guyingji, west of Chengwu County, turned north, and passed between Rangouji, southeast of Dingtao County, and Chenji, northeast of Dingtao County. On the 19th, they were intercepted by Li Xuande's cavalry regiment and the Dingtao militia brigade. They then fled northeast and arrived at Taipingji, 60 li west of Juye County on the evening of the same day. This morning (20th), they were surrounded and attacked on all sides by Wu Yuanxing's regiment, Lin Binghai's regiment of the 22nd Division, Li Yide's cavalry regiment, and Gu Liangyou's militia regiment. The fighting was fierce. It is estimated that more than 200 of Liu's forces were killed, more than 300 horses were killed, more than 100 people were captured alive, and more than 100 guns were captured. Liu's elite forces were almost completely lost. The remaining remnants of 6-700 people fled to the northwest of Yuncheng this afternoon (20th). Tonight, the armies are encircling them from all sides from Jiaxiang, Juye, Shouzhang, Caozhou, and Wenshang. The government army, together with Gu Liangyou, Xie Changxian, and the militia regiments on each route, totals about 20,000 people. Liu's forces have really run out of options. The Yellow River is to the northwest of Yuncheng, and the Grand Canal is to the northeast. They are trapped in the horns, and the south is densely covered with troops. The government has long since sailed away the boats on the Yellow River and the Grand Canal, intending to annihilate Liu's forces there. Liu's forces cannot advance or retreat. It is expected that they will be eliminated within a few days. Liangshan, where Song Jiang and others were entrenched, is located in Yuncheng. The government, fearing that Liu's forces would flee there, has also sent heavy troops to guard it. (March 20th)</p>

<p>—Taining Recovered, Royal Troops Stationed in Taining City—</p>
<p>—The Red Bandits are Already Trapped in a Four-Sided Encirclement—</p>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence: According to a telegram from the 10th Column Headquarters received by the Fuzhou Provisional Headquarters on the 20th, Taining County was recovered by Wang Zhonglian's division on the afternoon of the 19th. The bandit puppet 7th Army Group retreated into Jianning. Wang's troops seized 2 heavy machine guns, more than 300 rifles, captured more than 200 bandit officers and soldiers, wounded one puppet division commander, killed two puppet battalion commanders, and wounded or killed more than 300 bandit soldiers. Wang's troops have stationed themselves in Taining City, sending teams to search for bandit traces in the villages and handle local relief. However, a group of local Red bandits, Zou Qi's force, numbering about 1,000 people, took advantage of the fierce fighting on the Fujian-Jiangxi border to wreak havoc between Chong'an and Pucheng counties. Yesterday, the Provisional Headquarters ordered Liu Heding, commander of the 9th Column, to quickly send Zhang Luanji's division, stationed in Pucheng, to carry out the annihilation campaign. As for the entire military affairs of bandit suppression in northern Fujian, Chairman Chiang originally ordered Wei Lihuang, commander of the Eastern Route Front, to preside over it. However, after Wei arrived in the province from Quanzhou, his old rib pain recurred, and he requested a month's leave to recuperate in the province. Recently, the military progress in northern Fujian has been extremely rapid, and it is essential to have a dedicated commander. A telegram was sent to Wei urging him to go to supervise the battle immediately. The Red bandits on the Fujian border are already trapped in a four-sided encirclement. The bandit areas only remain in Jianning, Ninghua, Changting, and Liancheng counties. The date of their elimination should not be far off. (March 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Xiamen Wealthy Merchant Zeng Shangyuan Kidnapped <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Boat Crossing the Sea Missing</p>
<p>No News for Four Days</p>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: Zeng Shangyuan, a wealthy Xiamen merchant who returned from Yangon, was kidnapped by someone on the night of the 17th while crossing to Gulangyu by private motorboat. The boat is missing. An empty boat was found on Dongyu the next day. As of today (21st), there is still no news. This is an unprecedented major kidnapping case in Xiamen. There are many wealthy overseas Chinese who have returned to Xiamen, but this is the first time someone has been kidnapped. The process is as follows:</p>
<p>Zeng Shangyuan is from Tong'an, an overseas Chinese from Yangon, 65 years old, and runs a business in Southeast Asia. He once served as the general manager of the Singapore Overseas Chinese Bank and is currently still the chairman of the bank's board of directors. He returned to China ten years ago and has a huge fortune. He invested in real estate development in Xiamen's municipal reform, and built a row of huge mansions on Datong Road, next to the customs, which also serve as the Daqian Hotel and Restaurant. He lives at 38 Anhaijiao, Gulangyu. He must come to Xiamen every day to observe the business. Although Zeng is a wealthy man, he is very frugal. He usually crosses the sea by small boat. Recently, he purchased a private motorboat from Linsen Company for crossing the sea early and late. At 9:00 PM on the 17th, Zeng left the Daqian Hotel and crossed the sea by private motorboat. Unexpectedly, late at night, the family saw that Zeng had not returned and called Daqian to inquire. They replied that he had returned. They urgently sent someone to inquire at the wharves and relatives' homes on Gulangyu, but there was no trace of him, and the motorboat was also gone. By the morning of the next day (18th), there was still no news. Zeng's son, Yangwang, reported the case to the Maritime Branch Security Bureau, the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, and the Eastern Route Headquarters sent personnel to investigate. He also hired Luanji Electric Boat to search the nearby sea. At about 4:00 PM, the Maritime Public Security Bureau received a report from Li Minghua and Li Yuji, the heads of Dongyu Village, across the sea from Xiamen, stating that an unmarked motorboat was found drifting near the coast of Dongyu in the morning of the 18th, without anyone driving it. They did not know who had lost it. In addition to sending a guard team to temporarily guard it, they requested that personnel be dispatched quickly to investigate. On the morning of the 19th, the Maritime Public Security Bureau dispatched personnel along with Zeng's family to Dongyu to inspect it. It was indeed the motorboat Zeng was riding in. Many white lime powders were found in the boat, and the carpets in the boat were very messy, as if the bandits and Zeng had a struggle. There was a bullet hole on the right side of the wooden side of the bow steering room, and the window glass was shattered. A Browning shell casing was left on the ground. Judging from this, the bullet seemed to have been fired from inside the boat, so the shell casing was left in the boat. However, no blood was seen. In addition to Zeng, the helmsman Lin Tianguo and the driver Xu Hanguo were also missing. After this case occurred, all the detectives from the Land and Maritime Public Security Bureau urgently investigated. According to reports late on the 19th, there were more than 20 bandits who kidnapped Zeng, with eight Mauser pistols and two Thompson submachine guns, using three sailboats to carry out the kidnapping. The boats were still in the Houneicao area behind Gulangyu and would soon be heading elsewhere. The Maritime Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched more than 20 armed police officers on two electric boats, but found nothing upon arrival. Daqian Hotel presented a petition to the Eastern Route Headquarters, requesting that they be ordered to solve the case quickly. Zeng's son, Yangwang, also presented a petition to the Overseas Chinese Association, requesting that they forward it to the authorities for rescue. The Overseas Chinese Association immediately forwarded it. As of the night of the 20th, according to Zeng's family, there was still no news, and they had not received a letter from the bandits. According to Daqian Hotel's news, two bandits had stayed at Daqian Hotel a week before. When Zeng went to the hotel every day, they talked to Zeng and were already acquainted with each other. On the night of the 17th, the two invited Zeng to dinner and then said they were going to Gulangyu. Zeng invited them to take the motorboat together, and the two replied that it was very good. They then took the motorboat together. It is suspected that Zeng was kidnapped by them. (March 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Nanchang Lantern Parade <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Promoting the New Life Movement</p>
<p>Over 70,000 Participants</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Nanchang New Life Movement Lantern Parade was held on the 18th. Various government organizations and schools enthusiastically carried lanterns to gather at the stadium, reaching over 300 groups. The number of participants reached 70,000 to 80,000, all assembled at designated locations. After the chairman of the presidium, Deng Wenyi, performed the opening ceremony, Deng delivered a speech, stating that implementing the New Life Movement is the glory of the Chinese nation. We must tell the people of the whole country to implement the New Life Movement. Although the lanterns held by everyone today are of various shapes and colors, they are not the same; however, I believe that everyone's spirit in implementing the New Life Movement is fully expressed. I hope to maintain this spirit, and I hope everyone will act according to the intention of today. Then slogans were shouted: 1. Cultivate Propriety; 2. Know Shame; 3. Be Responsible; 4. Observe Discipline; 5. Be Punctual; 6. Love Cleanliness. After the meeting, the parade began, led by the military band, followed by the New Life Movement Promotion Association, with Deng Wenyi, Shao Hua, Cheng Shih-kuei, and others in the ranks. Following them were women's groups, government agencies, industry, commerce, and academic circles, and party headquarters at all levels, guided by Boy Scouts. Many people watched along the way.</p>
<p>The number of people participating in this lantern parade was more enthusiastic than the previous lantern parade promoting domestic goods, and the types of lanterns and their splendor were also better than the previous one. The following describes the good ones: (1) The Headquarters used lantern colors to form a giant tree. The trunk was the Republic of China, irrigated by the rules of the New Life Movement, and then the result of a strong country and a rich people could be achieved, taking the meaning of cultivating the foundation before the branches and leaves can be luxuriant. There were also five cars, divided into performances of clothing, food, housing, travel, and keeping time. The first car, clothing, was decorated with costumes of farmers, workers, merchants, students, and soldiers. Although the styles were different, they all showed that they should be neat and tidy. The second car, food, was decorated with a cafe, where customers explained that cold food should not be eaten. The third car, housing, was decorated with a model family, showing people an example of living facilities. The fourth car, travel, was decorated with a public road, where there were many pedestrians, but they were all in order. The fifth car, keeping time, was equipped with a giant clock, showing that time should be cherished. Each car was decorated with slogans. The cars were tied into bunkers to show people the method of guarding. (2) The Provincial Government built three platforms. One was called the life of ordinary people, where chickens and dogs lived together, the commode was placed on the bedside, and the rice pot was placed next to it. This is a sketch of the old life of ordinary people, which urgently needs to be improved. The second was the life of a fallen family, which was decorated cleanly, the clothes were simple, and the children knew etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Xu Zhanyuan's children, the captain of the provincial government's guard, sang the New Life Movement song on it. (3) The Highway Department had a total of eight cars. The first four cars were performances of clothing, food, housing, and travel. The fifth car was the order of the highway, the sixth car was the state of the highways in the province, the seventh car was a clock, and the eighth car was a majestic lion with shining eyes, roaring like thunder, named the Awakening Lion, implying the meaning of awakening the people of the country quickly. Also, on the top of the fourth car, there was a small car with exquisite decoration, which attracted attention. (4) Various groups, the bank sector made a brand lamp, which read "Filial Piety, Brotherhood, Loyalty, Trustworthiness, Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame." Under each word, there were illustrations, which were quite essential. The Lead Printing Workers' Union and the Brush Printing Industry Workers' Union both used white cloth, supporting the face, filled with lights in the middle, looking like a dragon lantern from a distance, and covered with slogans when viewed, and printed cartoons of the New Life Movement, which were distributed everywhere for publicity. The Salt Stacking Workers' Union used more than ten horses, decorated with figures, all kinds of new-style modern, old-style villages, and various costumes, all of which were available, and many implications were worth adopting. The Cloth Industry Guild used various colors of local cloth to make lanterns, which also conformed to the purpose of simplicity. The Firecracker Industry had a platform for Mencius' mother teaching her son, and the Drama Industry had dramas of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love, all of which had profound meanings. (5) Schools: The lanterns of various primary and secondary schools were mostly in the form of New Life Movement symbols, and occasionally one or two made fly-swatting lanterns and garbage-sweeping lanterns. However, the ranks of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts from all walks of life were neat, shouting slogans, singing New Life Movement songs, and the order was orderly, which was better than the industrial and commercial sectors. (6) Shops: The lanterns participated in by various shops mostly contained advertising effects. (Datong Society, March 20)</p>

<p>Zhang Shunfu, a native of this county, carried a large batch of coffee essence (one of the raw materials for red pills) in Shanghai the day before yesterday, intending to take a boat to Haimen. He was seized by the Water Patrol Team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau at the Xirenhe Wharf in the South City. Both the person and the stolen goods were transferred to the local court for interrogation. According to Zhang's confession, this batch of medicinal materials was entrusted by his friend Jin Shaochang to be delivered to the Zhongying Pharmacy in Haimen County for use in combination with medicines, denying that it was a raw material for making red pills. The local court believed that it was necessary to thoroughly investigate whether this batch of medicinal materials was used for making red pills, so it sent a letter to the county government of this county, ordering the police to search the pharmacy. The county government secretly ordered the County Public Security Bureau yesterday (the 19th). The section chief Xu Wenlong and inspector Ding Zuozhou led more than ten armed police officers to search. They found eight iron boxes of coffee essence and more than ten pieces of scattered pill materials such as sugar powder and Taikoo sugar. They took the owner of the store, Pu Zhuping, to the bureau and sent him to the county government for interrogation the next day.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Public Appeal to Preserve Ancient Tombs of the Ming Dynasty <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>In You Duli, 18th ward outside the East Gate, formerly known as Huixi, there is an ancient tomb of the You family, which is recorded in the county chronicles. There are five people in the tomb: (1) You Jujing, a commoner of the Ming Dynasty, gifted the title of associate administrator; (2) You Wupu, repeatedly solicited for filial piety and integrity in Yongle Jihai, Xuande Kuichou, and Zhengtong Dingyi, assisted in the seventh rank, served as a great guest of the township drink, and was enshrined in the township sage shrine of this county; (3) You Zhengyan, a Juren in Jingtai Gengwu, the magistrate of Suian County, Zhejiang, and the associate administrator of Yongchang; (4) You Shiqian was recommended to serve as an instructor in Wujin County; (5) You Suiliang, a Juren in Chenghua Kuimao, served as the magistrate of Chuxiong, Chongyang, Cangwu, and Jiangchuan counties, and was enshrined in the famous officials shrines of Yunnan and Guangxi provinces. Gong Wupu wrote two volumes of quotations, which can be found in the History of the Ming Dynasty and the Collection of the Tenth Beginning, which can be found in the Bibliography of Xishan Dynasties. Gong Suiliang wrote the Draft of Political Affairs and the Draft of Living at Home, which can be found in the Bibliography of Xishan Dynasties. You Jujing was born in the fourth month of the third year of the Yuan Dynasty. He was ordered by the imperial court to cultivate ten hectares of land, and he opened a pool in the gap land and obtained thirty ingots of medium gold to help the villagers. The villagers praised his virtue, so they changed the name Huixi to You Tu (now called You Duli) to show that they would not forget. It can be seen that he was a famous sage at that time. At that time, Gong Wupu had submitted memorials to the Ministry of Personnel, etc., calling him a true Confucian scholar of the holy world, all of which are recorded in the county chronicles and the Changzhou prefectural chronicles. Recently, the Xihu Highway was built, and its route happened to include the tomb. After hearing the news, his descendant You Tong (Gan Cheng) said that the tomb had a historical relationship and was recorded in the county chronicles. There were only 26 famous tombs in the Ming Dynasty, and the You family actually occupied two of them. He could not bear to destroy the ancient tomb of the famous sage. On the 15th and 19th of this month, he telegraphed Shen, the director of the Construction Department, asking the county to bypass the tomb. After the telegram was sent, he did not receive a reply, so he submitted another presentation yesterday, detailing the process. The text briefly investigates and handles road work. Whenever encountering the tomb of a famous person, unless it is absolutely necessary, it is usually bypassed. Moreover, according to the method told by Director Zhang of the Construction Bureau, the shift is only dozens of feet, which has nothing to do with the overall situation. Moving the tomb to the plain is just a matter of raising a hand, and the ancient tomb of the famous sage can be preserved, which is a great blessing. It is now heard that the project will start soon, and I respectfully ask for a quick decision and a clear instruction. The dead will be grateful underground, and the living will be grateful for generations to come. It is also heard that more than ten gentry of the county, including Cai Wenxin, have also jointly submitted a presentation to Director Shen, asking to slightly change the route of the road, only needing to go straight to the route on the north side of Youdu River, after the Xiao Lane and on the roadbed of the Backpack Lane, which can be straightened and save the construction of a bridge, which is beneficial to both the public and private sectors. It is thought that Director Shen will definitely adopt it.</p>

<p>Liu Zhuomin, the former chief of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau in this county, was recently removed from his post by the order of the department, but Liu refused to hand over because he had a relative relationship with Li Shuyun, the concubine of Director Gu. His wife, Li Rongzhen, also made trouble in the bureau, obstructing official business. County Magistrate Yan has transferred Liu to the county court for interrogation. It is learned that the provincial government believes that Li Shuyun is also involved in this case, so it telegraphed Xu Pucheng, the chief of the First District of the Water Police, to detain Li Shuyun at 15 Xinmin Village, Malang Road, Shanghai, and present her to the Special District Court for temporary detention. At the same time, it telegraphed the county government of this county, County Magistrate Yan, to forward a letter to the county court for notification. After the procuratorate approved the letter, yesterday (22nd), it specially dispatched bailiffs Yang Shuzi and Feng Yongbao with documents to Shanghai to ask the Special Court to bring Li Shuyun back to Wuxi for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Recent Situation of the Liutang River Dredging Project <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the Liutang River Project in Jiangbei was in disrepair for a long time, so whenever there was a year of flooding or a mountain torrent, the farmland in the seven counties along the river, including Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, Shuyang, Lianshui, and Dongguan, would be flooded. Shen Baixian, the current director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, moved to dredge the river in all directions when he was the director of the Construction Department, but it did not come to fruition. Last year, when Shen first took office, he continued to proceed and was finally approved by the provincial government meeting, and Xu Dingkang, the director of the Transportation Bureau, was commissioned to concurrently serve as the director of the project. It has been three months, according to recent surveys, Shuyang should do the most engineering, totaling 800,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and County Magistrate Shen Jinghua is still able to be loyal to his duties, recruiting more than 14,000 workers every day, stationed in the work area to supervise, and the embankment project will be completed by the end of the month, and the dredging work will also be started after preliminary testing, and it can be completed in about less than May. Suqian, Lianshui, and Donghai counties have each allocated 400,000 cubic meters of earthwork, except for Donghai County Magistrate Wen Qinming, who was dismissed for negligence, Suqian County Magistrate Zhang Naifan and Lianshui County Magistrate Yang Tongsheng are all able to fulfill their duties and can be completed within April. Guanyun is located in the lower reaches of Liutang, and the river center of the Longgou and other places in the territory is silted up, making dredging difficult, and its county magistrate was also dismissed for negligence. It is difficult to reverse the construction period until the new county magistrate takes office. Siyang has allocated 100,000 more cubic meters of earthwork than Guanyun, totaling 350,000, and the number of workers arriving every day is about 4,000, and it can be completed after the middle of next month. Among the seven counties, Huaiyin has only allocated 130,000 cubic meters of earthwork, the smallest number, but there are more than 1,000 workers arriving every day, and it can also be completed within this month.</p>

Upon learning of this, the Newspaper Guild immediately convened an emergency meeting and telegraphed the Tangzha Public Security Bureau through the county government to detain the police car. County Magistrate Cheng also inquired about it by telephone with County Magistrate Lin of Rugao and reprimanded Police Zhou and others, who left Tong that night, and Zhu was released.</p>

<p>Recently, the silk market in Huzhou has been sluggish, and silk prices have plummeted. It is difficult for various silk weaving factories to maintain. Representatives from both capital and labor have held several meetings to reduce working hours, but there has been no result, so they have not yet started weaving. The local Huzhou Newspaper commented on the 19th from an impartial standpoint, urging both labor and capital to make concessions within the possible range in accordance with the principle of sharing the same boat, so as to avoid expansion. Unexpectedly, it caused a misunderstanding from the labor side. On the afternoon of the 19th, thousands of workers gathered and went to the county government to petition. After withdrawing, they went to the newspaper's editorial department and destroyed all the equipment and important documents. They illegally arrested Ding Zhenxiang, an employee of the newspaper's advertising department, and twisted him to the Silk Weaving Workers' Union, forcing him to hand over the editorial staff, and imprisoned Ding for two hours before releasing him. The local newspapers convened an emergency meeting at 2 pm yesterday to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that: (1) The party and government authorities should be required to severely punish the perpetrators and order them to compensate for the losses and ensure the safety of journalists in the future; (2) The newspapers should jointly send a telegram to the Hangzhou Journalists Association to express their support. After the meeting, representatives from the newspapers went to the county government and the county party headquarters to petition. County Magistrate Dai and Standing Committee Member Gu received them and gave satisfactory answers to the first item of the resolution and decided to investigate and severely punish the perpetrators.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Central Executive Committee Explains Penalties for Publishing Law <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>And Informs National Government to Order Courts to Comply</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency, Beijing: The Central Executive Committee previously received a presentation from the Shanghai Newspaper Guild requesting an explanation of whether newspaper editors or publishers should be dealt with in accordance with the penalties of the Publishing Law when they are sued for publishing news. The Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee submitted the case to the Standing Committee for approval and replied to the Guild. The Shanghai Newspaper Guild's presentation and the Central Executive Committee's reply are recorded below:</p>
<p>Editor and Publisher Sued for Publishing News: Presentation requesting instructions on whether newspaper editors or publishers should be dealt with in accordance with the penalties of the Publishing Law when they are sued for publishing news. The presenter believes that newspaper editors and publishers collect and record news as third parties. Even if the original manuscript contains excesses beyond the scope of facts and violates civil and criminal laws or other regulations, the editor or publisher has no initial intention to commit an offense and has no persistent malice. The legal responsibility they should bear is, at most, within the scope of negligence and cannot be regarded as intentional. Therefore, except for the serious circumstances specified in Article 19 of the Publishing Law, which should be punished in accordance with Article 35 of the same law, other circumstances are relatively minor and should be corrected by publishing corrections or rebuttals in accordance with Article 14 of the same law. Other laws should not be cited for sanctions against editors and publishers who are purely third parties. The Secretariat of the Union clearly explained this in its reply to the Civil Service Office of the National Government, Secret Letter No. 14298. However, in recent times, law enforcers have often ignored this explanation of the Union and have not examined the intent of the accused party, but have punished the author, editor, and publisher in accordance with civil and criminal laws or other regulations, causing the editors and publishers of newspapers to lose the protection they should have under the Publishing Law, and confusing the author's intentional actions with the editor and publisher's negligence, which is obviously unfair and violates the spirit of the law, making those who operate newspapers feel insecure. Therefore, the presenter is specially requesting the Union to review and approve a clear explanation order for compliance in order to end disputes and ensure the safety of the newspaper industry, which is not only the prayer of the presenter, but also the intention of the Central Government to maintain the newspaper industry. Respectfully presented to the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Deal with it in accordance with the Publishing Law, not with other methods: Regarding the case presented by your Guild requesting an explanation of whether newspaper editors or publishers should be dealt with in accordance with the penalties of the Publishing Law when they are sued for publishing news, the Standing Committee approved, "Check the case and reply," stating that newspaper agencies and news agencies are established after applying for registration in accordance with the procedures of the Publishing Law. Therefore, unless the editor of a newspaper violates the provisions of ordinary civil and criminal laws due to personal actions, or violates the restrictions of Article 19 of the Publishing Law, and can be punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of the same law in accordance with other heavier laws, for all other violations of the Publishing Law, courts at all levels should deal with it in accordance with the provisions of the Publishing Law and should not cite other laws for sanctions. This explanation has been transferred to the National Government to inform courts at all levels to comply with it and to inform the Ministry of the Interior. In view of the above, this reply is hereby made for your information. To the Shanghai Newspaper Guild, Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee.</p>

<p>The Shanghai North China Products Exhibition, sponsored by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, held its opening ceremony yesterday at 2:00 PM. Party and government agencies, as well as various commercial and industrial groups, sent representatives to attend the ceremony. More than a thousand people attended, making it quite crowded. The ceremony concluded at 4:00 PM. Details of the opening are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue: The exhibition is located inside the Zhabei Charity Association on Datong Road in northern Shanghai. A colorful archway was erected in front of the main entrance, with the words "Shanghai North China Products Exhibition" written on white cloth. Entering the gate leads to a temporary marketplace. The layout of the marketplace is in a three-curve shape, with temporary stores of various manufacturers on both sides. To the left of the marketplace, a temporary performance area is set up with a stage in the center. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the national flag are hung on the stage. To attract the attention of the citizens of northern Shanghai, the association has hung white cloth banners with the words "Shanghai North China Products Exhibition" all over the area, including Xinza Road Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, Xinmin Road, and Shanban Factory New Bridge.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: The attendees included Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao), Director of the International Trade Bureau He Bingxian (represented by Ji Zexin), Wang Yansong of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (represented by Yuan Hongjun), Wu Yun Chu (represented by Zhu Ligong) Manager of Tianchu Seasoning Factory, Chen Binghui, Yuan Hongjun, Cao Zhigong, Zhang Yichen, Situ Ji, Chen Weiwen, Zhang Yizhai, Sun Xiangpu, Liang Gengshun, She Xipin, Cai Qiajun, Fang Peicheng, Li Guilin, Yu Zhongxian, Wu Jue, Chen Jiufeng, Qiu Jialiang, Hu Fengxiang, and more than a thousand citizens.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: After the ceremony, Chairman Liu Zhongying gave a report, saying, "Distinguished representatives and guests, today is the opening ceremony of the Shanghai North China Products Exhibition organized by our association. We are honored by the presence and guidance of various sectors.</p>
<h3 id="e120">(Photo taken by Qichang Photo Studio) <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>We are both unfortunate and fortunate. Due to the tight schedule, we were unable to plan this national product movement in detail. Fortunately, we have received enthusiastic mutual assistance from various manufacturers, enabling us to achieve this great feat. We are privately delighted and hope that all sectors will offer advice from time to time to guide us and make up for our shortcomings. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches: Then, Ji Zexin, representing He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, delivered a speech, saying, "I am honored to participate in the opening ceremony of the National Products Exhibition organized by your esteemed association today. Your association members are not only enthusiastic about the production of national products, but also work hard to promote national products for the reference of the people. The purpose is to increase the general public's knowledge of distinguishing between national products and non-national products. This kind of movement is indeed a crucial plan for saving the country today. Since the opening of our country's ports, the import of foreign goods has increased year by year, and the patterns of imported goods are complex and varied. If foreign goods are allowed to have the same names and patterns as national products, we often buy daily necessities in the market and get confused between Chinese and foreign products, and we don't understand the truth. Some ignorant stores often pass off foreign goods as national goods, and sometimes pass off national goods as foreign goods, making it impossible for general customers to distinguish between right and wrong. Even patriotic men and women who are determined to buy national goods have nowhere to turn. This point is indeed a major enemy of national product sales. I sincerely hope that all those who are enthusiastic about industry in the country should promote the national product exhibition movement throughout the country and awaken the deep attention of our 400 million compatriots to national products. Furthermore, observing the progress of modern science, the advancement of material civilization, and those who are engaged in the manufacture of goods, they strive for perfection and strive to improve. The products of various modern countries are changing with each passing day, and the structure of goods tends to be practical, convenient, and modernized, so buyers are happy to use them. At the same time, in terms of raw materials and manufacturing methods, measures are taken to reduce costs in order to compete with foreign goods. In recent years, the import of Japanese goods has been astonishing in quantity, and the price is lower than any national product. From an economic point of view, people naturally buy cheap things, and the price is higher</p>
<p>Commodities, of course, are affected a lot. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the leaders of manufacturing plants in our country should cooperate by industry, organize product research institutions, gather specialized talents, and carefully study and test to improve national product manufacturing and reduce costs, in order to compete with foreign goods. And I hope that the export of national products will increase and occupy a considerable position in international trade, in order to wash away the humiliation of import surplus, which is our hope." After the speech, Li Dachao, representing Wu Tiecheng, delivered a speech, saying, "The mayor is busy with official duties and cannot attend the meeting, so he sent his brother to participate in this grand ceremony. Today, you can come to participate so enthusiastically, which shows everyone's enthusiasm for promoting national products. I hope that citizens will carefully select and purchase national products for all kinds of applied items related to clothing, food, housing and transportation in the future, and it will be effective in a few years." After the speech, Chen Binghui, Yuan Hongjun, and others gave speeches in succession (the speeches are omitted). Finally, Yu Zhongxian gave a thank-you speech, and then led the guests to visit the association for a week, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Entertainment Programs: After the opening ceremony was held in the assembly hall, the association began</p>
<p>Performing entertainment at 4:00 PM. Yesterday's program was the National Product Propaganda Drama of the Chinese National Product Dress-up Speech Group, and Lu Xiaowu, Pei Yanghua, Xu Shengxiang, etc. performed comedy and magic, which ended at 10:00 PM. It is reported that from 2:00 PM today, Lu Xiaohong, Lu Xiaolan, Su Tan, He Feixiang hula dance, etc. have been hired, which is quite exciting.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The Jianghai Customs Revises the Registration Method for Customs Declaration by Business Firms <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Register with the Customs in accordance with the regulations starting next month</p>
<p>Blank application forms can be obtained from the Customs</p>
<p>In order to revise the registration method for customs declaration by business firms, the Jianghai Customs Commissioner has issued Announcement No. 1348, stating that the method for business firms and customs declaration firms to register with the Customs has been announced by the General Affairs Section of the Customs on January 15 of the Republic of China, 21 years. Now, the items related to the customs registration of business firms in this method are revised as follows: Starting from April 1 of this year, all domestic or foreign business firms and individuals handling customs declaration matters must register with the Customs or re-register in accordance with the following regulations: (A) The first registration application must be certified. The certification procedures are as follows: (1) If the applicant is a domestic citizen, it must be certified by a reliable merchant, business firm, or institution known to the Customs. (2) If the applicant is a foreigner with extraterritorial rights, it must be certified by the competent consul. (3) If the applicant is a foreigner without extraterritorial rights, it must be certified by a reliable merchant, business firm, or institution known to the Customs. (B) All business firms or individuals who have registered must prepare an application form in January of each year and submit it to the Customs for re-registration once. However, this application form does not need to be certified. The method for customs declaration firms to register with the Customs has not changed, and the seals and signatures submitted to the Customs for record will not be affected by this revision. Starting from April 1 of this year, if business firms and individuals have not re-registered in accordance with this revised method, they will be deemed as unregistered.

The annual guarantee of each shipping company will not be affected by this revision. Business firms that need this blank registration application form can obtain it from the business firm and customs declaration registration counter in the General Affairs Section of the Customs.

<h3 id="e131">The Chamber of Commerce Requests a Reduction in the Diesel Tax Rate <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government in Nanjing yesterday, requesting a reduction in the diesel tax rate: (Titles omitted) Recently, the representatives of the member companies of the affiliated association have come to the meeting one after another, all stating that the Ministry of Finance has levied 26.3 gold units per ton of diesel oil imported since February 1 of this year, which is about 49 yuan in national currency. According to the original price of the diesel oil, which is more than 70 yuan per ton, the added tariff has reached 70% of the oil price, which is really unexpected. At this time when industry and commerce are declining, our power industry is particularly affected. If we suddenly increase this huge amount of oil tax again, business will be more difficult and will be in a desperate situation. We believe that your association is the hub of all industries in Zhejiang. Please consider the vital interests of the member companies and quickly appeal to the government to find a way to provide relief and maintain a glimmer of life. We are deeply dependent on it. It is said that the use of diesel engine power generation in the electrical companies in Zhejiang Province has accounted for 89%. At this time when the people are poor and business is difficult, the electrical industry is no exception. However, because public utilities are closely related to social stability and factory production, we have to maintain it despite the deficit. Now, the heavy tax on diesel oil has suddenly increased, which has put us in a desperate situation. Correspondingly, we hereby request your association to forward it to the government, requesting a reduction in the levy to relieve the business difficulties, etc., and to approve this. The National Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e132">A Wooden Ship with Sunken Wood off the Coast of Wusong Estuary <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The wooden ship Jinyufa, loaded with wood from Fujian to Shanghai, arrived at the Xiaota ocean surface about 70 miles off the coast of Wusong Estuary at about 8:00 PM on the 20th. Between buoys No. 3 and No. 4, it suddenly encountered a violent wind and rain, and huge waves, which caused it to lose its steering ability. After being hit by several huge waves, the bottom of the ship suddenly flooded and the hull cracked. Tens of thousands of pieces of wood were lost at the same time. At that time, all the sailors climbed to the mast and sails in an attempt to escape. In an instant, the ship completely sank into the sea, and only a few feet of the tens of feet high mast were exposed above the water. At that time, a total of 19 old sailors were drowned, including sailors Zhong Aden, Jin Yi, and Wang Xinzhang, who clung to the sails and drifted with the wind. In the evening and early morning, the Ningbo Liner New Beijing arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo, and heard Zhong and others shouting for help, and then learned the previous situation. However, due to the excessive speed of the ship and the tide, it was unable to rescue them at that time. When the ship arrived in Songjiang, it notified the Wusong Maoxing Company, which immediately dispatched the Lisheng small steamer to rush to the scene of the accident. Zhong and others were rescued back to Shanghai, and three more corpses were seen drifting with the sails. It was not until yesterday morning that people from the Shanghai Timber Company hired a boat to go to inspect and find ways to salvage them. It is reported that the loss of this shipment is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway Preparatory Office issued a notice the day before yesterday, stating that the association originally planned to hold the third inaugural meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 28th of this month, which has been notified by letter. Now, because that day coincides with the meeting held by the National Economic Committee in Beijing, and most of the initiators are members of the National Economic Committee, in order to avoid time conflicts, we have specially rescheduled the meeting to 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month, still at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for the third initiators meeting. In addition to sending letters, we hereby inform you to check and arrive on time. If you cannot attend in person, please send a responsible representative to attend.</p>
<h3 id="e134">New Initiatives of the China National Products Production and Sales Company <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Preparing to establish Nanjing and Fujian National Products Companies</p>
<p>Organizing two exhibitions in North China and Northwest China</p>
<p>Since the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Company was established on January 16, it has appointed Wu Tingsheng as the general manager and is making every effort to develop its business. In addition to formulating various business guidelines and phased plans, it is also preparing to establish two national products companies in Nanjing and Fujian, and two national products exhibitions in North China and Northwest China. It is assisting the Chicago Expo Production Association in collecting exhibits. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing National Products Company: The Nanjing National Products Company was initiated by Nanjing Mayor Shi Ying and was discussed and decided at the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the company. It was decided to prepare for the establishment first, and the total capital was set at 50,000 yuan. The Nanjing Municipal Government subscribed for 10,000 yuan of the company's shares and designated it as the share capital of the Nanjing Company. The remaining 40,000 yuan will be raised in Nanjing. After Ren Jinpin and Wu Guangzhi went to Beijing to prepare, a preparatory office was set up in the Nanjing Municipal Government. Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo was hired as the honorary director of the preparatory office, Mayor Shi Ying and Bian Xiaoqing were the directors and deputy directors, and Zhang Mengwen was the general secretary. Fifteen people including Zhang Bingsen, Bian Zhuxuan, and Huang Cilun were invited as secretaries. An outline of the organization was formulated, and preparations were actively made. It was decided that it could be opened within a month.</p>
<p>Fujian National Products Company: Former Fujian Finance Director Chen Peikun and Fujian Huixingyuan President Dong Kunfan believe that Fujian Province is an important commercial port, and foreign goods are dumped and domestic products are stagnant. After examining the reasons, it is because the commercial markets for promoting domestic goods are rare. Since the political upheaval, all industries have been depressed. In particular, promoting domestic goods and establishing sales agencies are urgent tasks today. Therefore, we immediately sent a letter to the company for review. Subsequently, the Shanghai Sanshan Guild also requested the organization of a Fujian branch to jointly discuss the progress. The company convened representatives from both sides on the 7th of this month to discuss the organization method. After negotiation and agreement, Chen Peikun and Dong Kunfan were invited to be responsible, and the Sanshan Guild would actively prepare. A concrete method will be available soon and will be carried out in order.</p>
<p>Setting up an Exhibition in North China: In order to develop trade in North China, the company has a plan to set up an exhibition in North China. Since Song Yunpu was sent to Beijing to discuss with Huang Fu, Chairman of the Peiping Organizing Government Affairs Committee, Yuan Liang, Mayor of Peiping, Leng Zhanqi, Chairman of the Peiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Wendian, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the North China authorities have sent letters successively, inviting the company to prepare as soon as possible and gather domestic product factories to participate. The company set up a preparatory office for the exhibitions in North China and Northwest China, and recently sent letters to Wang Wendian and Wang Hanshen in Tianjin to prepare and proceed first. In Shanghai, Zhu Dechao is in charge of everything, and is soliciting unanimous participation from various factories in the city. It is currently in active progress.</p>
<p>Assisting the Export Association: Since the Chicago Exposition Export Association decided to continue to participate in the 1934 Chicago Expo, it has been proceeding with all the work in separate groups because the opening date is approaching. In addition to sending letters to various provinces to collect exhibits, and because the company is a production and sales cooperation agency and has considerable contact with various manufacturers, it also sent a letter to request assistance. It is learned that the company is also sending letters to various factories to transport various excellent products to compete, as a prelude to developing foreign trade.</p>
<p>Setting up an Exhibition in Northwest China: The association had previously discussed the progress methods by letter between Liu Ruzhan, Director of the Gansu Construction Department, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Since the company was established, after Yu Zheren, Director of the province, came to Shanghai, Ren Jinpin and Zhu Dechao met and discussed that foreign goods were dumped in the Northwest, becoming more and more serious. If domestic goods were not actively promoted, the corner of the Northwest would be in a state of irrecoverable disaster. Therefore, a letter was immediately sent to Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of the province, to lead the progress. Once the letter is replied, it will be implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Municipal Council Approves the Expenses of the Band <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The expenses of the Municipal Council Band this year have been reviewed by the Music Committee. Including material expenses, the total is 245,590 yuan. During the discussion, the Director of Finance stated that, in view of the current financial situation, if the band cannot get the support of the public, it will be difficult to pay this expense. Therefore, we should consider how to attract public attention to this issue. The Chairman of the Committee expressed his sympathy for this proposal and said that the band is now making efforts to the public by presenting radio broadcasts, but there are still many aspects to be worked on and should be continued unremittingly. Regarding the appropriation of 2,800 yuan for the purchase of new musical scores listed in the budget, the Director of Finance stated that public opinion seems to be unwelcome to the new musical scores, and this appropriation is quite problematic. It is the consensus that this appropriation can be used to purchase more popular musical scores to make up for the current shortage. In addition, the band previously held a concert for young audiences, and the results were excellent. Many people requested another performance, which has been approved by the Committee, and it was decided to increase the price of tickets for adults. This proposal was submitted to the Board of Directors and was approved.</p>
<h3 id="e136">工部局 Considers Changing Election Procedures <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Not Feasible This Year</p>
<p>During the annual taxpayers' meeting in April of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council proposed a slight revision to Article 18 of the Land Regulations to improve the procedures for electing directors and to better suit the current situation. This revision includes four points: (1) increasing the number of polling places; (2) abolishing the procedure of voters signing their names; (3) extending the polling hours from the original 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM to 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; and (4) increasing the number of vote counters. After the proposal was passed by the taxpayers' meeting, the Municipal Council, following established procedures, sent a letter to the leading consul on April 27, requesting them to complete the necessary procedures so that the amendment could take effect. However, the Chinese government has not yet expressed its agreement to this amendment, so the procedures have not been fully completed. The board elections this year will still be conducted according to the old rules.</p>

<p>Dr. Miao Shukang, Deputy Medical Officer of the Municipal Council's Health Department, has been promoted from Grade B to Grade A in the second class and appointed as Deputy Director of the Pathological Research Laboratory due to his excellent service performance, as requested by the Director of the Health Department to the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Fare Increase for Joint Shipping Between Qingyang Port and Hupu <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Due to Soaring Fuel Costs</p>
<p>A New Stop Added at Dahongqiao for Joint Transportation</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway began joint shipping operations with the Yuan Ji Steamboat Bureau between Qingyang Port and Hupu on October 1st of last year. The original fare from Qingyang Port to Hupu was 35 cents. It is now learned that the steamboat bureau has informed the railway bureau that, due to rising fuel costs and increased expenses, it intends to increase the fare between Qingyang Port and Hupu by 15 cents, for a total of 50 cents. To facilitate short-distance passengers, a new stop will be established midway at Dahongqiao for joint transportation. The fare between Qingyang Port and Dahongqiao will be 40 cents. The railway bureau has approved these changes.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Railway Bureau Rectifies Order Inside and Outside Stations <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Opening Time for Ticket Windows at Small Stations</p>
<p>Must Open One Hour Before Train Arrival</p>
<p>The Two-Line Traffic Department issued a circular yesterday to rectify order inside and outside stations, stating: "In the minutes of the first section affairs meeting held in the Beijing-Danyang section on the 7th of this month, proposal number four stated that while station cleanliness is very important, order inside and outside the stations should also be rectified. It was resolved that (1) station chiefs and railway police will be responsible for maintaining order when passengers purchase tickets; (2) the opening time for ticket windows at small stations will remain as usual, opening one hour before train arrival; (3) station staff duties and regulations, and loud hawking by vendors will be specified and prohibited by the station chiefs separately. Regarding the first point, notifications have been sent to the police departments stationed along the two lines to cooperate in maintaining order, ensuring that passengers enter and exit the ticket windows and entrances in an orderly manner. The station chiefs of each station are responsible for properly handling the second and third points separately. The section chiefs of each traffic section should inspect and report at any time. This circular is issued for your information and compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e140">Cotton Cloth Market to Officially Open <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Notice to Weaving Households to Expedite Production of Light-Colored Cloth for the Market</p>
<p>Strict Measures for Receiving Yarn to Prevent Mixing in Inferior Yarn</p>
<p>The China National Cotton Cloth Market on Guizhou Road in this city is actively preparing for its official opening. In order to promote the sale of domestically produced yarn, in addition to speeding up the construction of its own market to ensure early completion, the market has notified weaving households to expedite the production of light-colored cloth for market sales. Basic weaving households have also signed contracts to expedite the production of ordered goods. To prevent a few unscrupulous individuals among the weaving households from taking advantage of loopholes and mixing in inferior yarn, the market has established rules that basic weaving households receiving yarn for weaving ordered goods must receive it according to a fixed quota and not take more than they need or spend less. With these regulations, weaving households will not be able to mix in inferior yarn or illegally reduce costs, and the quality of goods will be uniform, which will benefit the purchasing of various customers. It is reported that the first phase of contracted basic weaving households in the market consists of 2,000 looms, with each loom producing one bolt of cloth per day, resulting in a monthly production of 60,000 bolts, requiring 1,500 pieces of yarn. Once the cloth market is successful, it will gradually expand to achieve the goal of controlling the Shanghai family cotton cloth industry and promoting the sale of domestically produced yarn.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Pudong Bank to Move to New Location <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>New Facilities After Relocation</p>
<p>The Pudong Commercial Savings Bank was founded in 1928. It was initially attached to the Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange, and its scope was very small. However, under the diligent management of Manager Pei Zhenyong, the business prospered and developed year by year. In 1930, a branch was first established in Laiyidu, Pudong. In 1931, the head office moved to Jiangxi Road. In 1933, a Zhoupu branch was added, and a warehouse was built in Pudong. The business grew rapidly. The bank also fulfilled its obligations to local public welfare organizations, adhering to the principle of serving the community. It spared no effort in collecting donations for the Pudong Fellow Association, the Northeast Relief Association, and the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, remitting disaster relief funds to disaster areas, collecting electricity fees for Pudong, paying wages for various factories, collecting fees for schools, and paying salaries for government agencies. It was wholeheartedly committed to these tasks and has won social praise and credit from all sectors. Due to business development, the original location was no longer sufficient. A new six-story building has been built at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Henan Road. The internal equipment has been arranged, and the bank is scheduled to move to the new location on March 26th of the Gregorian calendar. Regarding future business plans, special preferential savings deposits will be offered to facilitate storage for all sectors, and small-amount credit loans will be increased to adjust the social economy. All of this is based on the spirit of service. Pei Deyao has been specially hired as Assistant Manager to promote business with foreign merchants. Mr. Pei has worked at the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China for more than ten years, has extensive experience, and is familiar with the trading conditions of foreign merchants. His future development is sure to be promising. The current directors of the bank, such as Du Yuesheng, Li Jisheng, Wu Fengru, Pei Yunqing, Xi Laiqing, Chen Zixin, Pan Zhiwen, and Zhu Jing'an, are all renowned figures, and their development can be assured.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Industrial Factories Compete to Use New Diesel Fuel <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Since machine factories, manufacturing factories, shipping companies, etc., in this city learned that the Meifu Company's Dali Diesel, the Yazhou Company's Sula Oil, and the Deshigu Company's Zhuli Oil had increased in price due to tariff increases, they were initially shocked because of cost concerns. Later, they learned that these three oil companies now supply a new type of oil for various diesel engines, and the results are excellent. The price is not much different from the original price of Zhuli Diesel, etc. Therefore, they have all adopted the new oil. According to reporters, this new oil is not only suitable for large engines, but also for small engines and Chinese-made engines. For example, the 30-horsepower engine installed at Nanyang Middle School, two 8-horsepower engines at Tiande Lane in Zhabei, a 20-horsepower engine at Hongzhen Shuntai Lumber Mill, and various shipping companies such as Ning Shao Inland Water Shipping Company and Tongsheng Shipping Bureau have all switched to the new oil. The results are as good as the original thin oil. This is indeed good news for machine factories and small industries.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Import of Headless Bulbs Taxed as Finished Products <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Unscrupulous merchants import inferior headless bulbs as raw materials to evade taxes, and then sell them under different brands, which greatly affects the sales of domestic electric bulbs. This has attracted great attention from the electrical industry. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Mr. Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association, yesterday to inquire about the outcome of the above matter. According to Mr. Hu, since last month, the government has instructed all customs offices to collect a tariff of four yuan per day for headless bulbs, as if they were finished products. However, the unscrupulous merchants, knowing that this method of tax evasion cannot last, imported a large number of headless bulbs before the collection method was corrected. There are still many headless bulbs in stock in this city, but they have to hide them for fear of retroactive payment of tariffs.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Wu Jianguang Settles Lawsuit Against In-Laws <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Compensation of Four Dollars for the Price of the Study Tool</p>
<p>Daughter Apologizes to Father-in-Law to Resolve the Matter</p>
<p>Wu Jianguang, a blind man, previously hired lawyer Xi Yafu to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against his in-laws, Huang Fuyi, Mrs. Zhong (Huang's wife), Huang Peichu (Huang's son), and Huang's daughter, Mrs. Wu (Wu Jianguang's daughter-in-law), for damage, insult, and theft of a 50-year-old study tool. The court once summoned them and ordered them to try to settle out of court. The court also ruled that Wu Huang氏's portion was not subject to self-representation according to the law and was therefore not accepted. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the case was scheduled for continued hearing. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were present. The presiding judge, Wu Xiangzu, first inquired about the settlement progress of the two parties. According to the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Xi, the two sides had begun negotiations during the adjournment, and the plaintiff had put forward two conditions: (1) The defendant was to issue a written apology; (2) The defendant was to compensate for the study tool. The defendant fully agreed to the first condition but refused to compensate for the second, resulting in the failure of the settlement. The defendant's agent, lawyer Jiang Chiping, also stated the mediation process. Judge Wu believed that the two parties were relatives and should not be involved in litigation, and that the matter was trivial. He asked the defendant, Huang Fuyi, whether he had the sincerity to settle. Huang remained silent for a long time and then said that he could only fulfill one of the two conditions. If he compensated for the study tool, he would not apologize. Subsequently, lawyer Xi persuaded Wu and proposed a solution: the defendant would compensate four yuan for the price of the study tool and express his apology in court. Both parties did not object. The defendant, Mrs. Huang Zhong, took out four yuan and gave it to Wu Jianguang, and her daughter, Mrs. Wu Huang氏 (the plaintiff's daughter-in-law), apologized to the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant. The case was then settled. After both parties signed, Judge Wu ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>

<p>The China Huanan Chemical Industry Company previously signed a contract with movie queen Hu Die to use Hu's portrait as a trademark to manufacture toothpaste, snow cream, face powder, perfume, and other cosmetics. However, due to a trademark dispute between the company and the Family Industry Company, the company delayed the manufacture of various products (only producing toothpaste). Hu Die, believing that the China Huanan Chemical Industry Company had violated the contract, hired lawyer Feng Xizui to file a complaint with the civil court of the Second Special District Court, requesting the termination of the contract with the China Huanan Chemical Industry Company. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend themselves. This has been reported in the newspaper. After the trial, the court ruled against the plaintiff's claim. Hu Die expressed dissatisfaction with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The Higher Court, based on the petition, held a hearing at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, presided over by Judge Guo Dezhang, with Assessors Zhang Chaozuo and Li Shouyi. Both parties were represented by lawyers. It was stated that the two parties were currently mediating outside of court and requested an extension. The court approved the request. If the mediation fails, a new hearing will be scheduled.</p>

<p>The Maochang Egg Factory, located on Huangtan Road north of the Waibaidu Bridge in Hongkou, also operates a refrigerated warehouse and sells machine ice. It specializes in the export trade of frozen eggs and offers storage for customers. If fellow businesses have fresh eggs and various fresh goods, they can be sent to the factory's refrigerated warehouse for storage, and the business is thriving. The factory buildings range from No. 34 to No. 45, with more than ten buildings. Yesterday afternoon, at around 1:00 p.m., a fire broke out in the central warehouse due to carelessness. The fire immediately broke through the roof. In addition to driving to the rescue, Western firefighters, the Pujiang firefighting boat also sailed to the Dongyang Company wharf to help extinguish the fire. It was extinguished after 3:00 p.m., and the loss was significant. It is reported that they all have fire insurance.</p>

<p>Elect Representatives to Petition the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Business Community Jointly Submits a Petition for Negotiation</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, shops in Xujiahui Town in western Shanghai gathered at the office of the Town's Business Community Federation to hold an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures against the French Municipal Council's demolition of water pipes, expulsion of vendors, and deprivation of our police power, which are major events. Those present included Yang Jingcheng of Bao Kang Rice Store, Jing Yiyi of Wan Shen Sauce Garden, Dong Xueshi of Dechangshun Nanhuhuo Store, Chen Qilie of Rendetang Pharmacy, Wang Yunqing of Wan Cui Sauce Garden, Zhu Zhaorong of Wan Yong Trough Workshop, Zhou Zhaochang of Xiangtai Butcher Shop, Xu Meilong of Longxing Restaurant, Xu Guoliang of Yuanshun Salted Goods Store, Zhang Chuanquan of Hengxing Doufu Store, as well as Zhou Chengxiang, Chairman of the Business Community Federation, Xu Jiyu, Head of the French Area Defense Corps, Chen Xiaomei of the Ninth District Party Department, Jin Xihan of the District Branch, Xie Qingbai of the Yancheng Fellow Association in Shanghai, Li Mengnan of the Ninth District Soap and Drug Industry Association, Ma Zhiyao of the Vendors' Federation, and Jiang Shouzhi, a citizen representative, totaling more than 20 people.</p>
<p>Zhou Chengxiang was elected as chairman and reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the road in question had always been under the jurisdiction of the Chinese authorities, with police posts set up to maintain traffic. In the spring of 1927, when the revolutionary army arrived in Shanghai, the French Municipal Council erected wooden stakes and installed barbed wire on the road to demarcate the boundary between the Chinese and French areas and prevent fleeing soldiers from entering. In 1931, the road was repaired by the Municipal Works Bureau and paved with asphalt. Subsequently, a British commercial bus from the Fourth Route turned around at the site and was prohibited from passing by the post police of the Second Station of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on the grounds that the land belonged to the Chinese area. This is a fact that everyone has seen and heard. Furthermore, the fort built by the French Municipal Council on the bank of the Zhaojiabang River was also seized without authorization, and the case remains unresolved to this day. Now, the French police have also pried off the lead plate of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Sixth District Second Station guard post nailed to the electric wire pole in front of Yang Baokang Rice Store, expelled the stationed police officers, and ordered the vendors to move away. This is a loss of sovereignty and humiliation of the country. After discussion, the results were: (1) Jointly submit a petition to the authorities to lodge a strong protest with the French Consul; (2) Elect representatives to petition the Municipal Government; (3) Send letters to various organizations for united assistance; (4) Schedule a general meeting of representatives from all walks of life in Xujiahui; (5) confidential; (6) Restore the original police power; (7) The French police are not allowed to interfere with the shacks along the riverbank under Xujiahui Road. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<p>All Criminals Transferred to Court Yesterday</p>
<p>On the 13th of this month, the Supervisory Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau suddenly received a secret report stating that a secret organization for manufacturing morphine and heroin was set up inside No. 23 Hengxing West Lane, 16th Pu, Nanshi, Chinese territory, specializing in manufacturing various drug pills and white powder raw materials. Among them, the Flying Horse brand of morphine was the most famous, and its poison reached a wide range of provinces. Please send personnel to arrest them quickly. After the supervisor reported, he personally supervised the officers and police officers to go to the ambush and arrest. Sure enough, the criminals and stolen goods were all seized. In addition to discovering a large number of drug raw materials, a large organization trigger box and a secret vehicle were also seized. (The vehicle's seat cushions and backrests are equipped with secret organizations that can hide 20 tins of red pills).

<h3 id="e151">Marriage Aims Not Achieved After Two Years of Marriage <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Sun Xiu'e Sues Sun Yusheng for Impotence</p>
<p>Requests Divorce and Return of Dowry</p>
<p>—Sun Yusheng Claims He Can Have Intercourse and Requests Inspection—</p>
<p>Sun Yusheng, a native of Nanxiang, is currently 26 years old. On November 10, 1931, he married Sun Xiu'e (currently 24 years old), a woman from Ningbo, through a matchmaker. Now, after more than two years, Sun Xiu'e hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the civil court of the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce and demanding compensation for dowry and other expenses totaling 2,970 yuan. The reason for this is quite amusing, and is briefly described below. The plaintiff married the defendant on November 10, 1931, and has been living with him for more than two years. Although they live in the same room, they have never been separated, but she is still a virgin and has never had intercourse. The defendant admitted that he has lung disease and often coughs up blood, so he cannot have intercourse. However, medical experts say that those who suffer from lung disease, even in the second or third stage, not only do not reduce their sexual desire, but are even more sexually motivated than ordinary people. It can be seen that the defendant must have a hidden illness that prevents him from having intercourse besides lung disease. He is obviously impotent and has no qualifications for marriage at all. The plaintiff is an old-fashioned woman and is ashamed to talk about such things. However, the defendant's condition is so serious that he is like a disabled person. If it can be cured, who would not want to be cured? Now that they have been married for two years, the purpose of marriage has not been achieved, which clearly shows that his illness is incurable. In accordance with Articles 995 and 999 of the Civil Code, she requests a divorce and the return of dowry, etc. Sun Yusheng also hired lawyer Chen Jinrong to request the Special First Court Mediation Office to summon and mediate the reasons for cohabitation. Sun stopped having intercourse for two years due to his lung disease and following doctor's orders, hoping to recover. Unexpectedly, last November, Xiu'e was instigated by others and used the excuse of returning to Ningbo to leave and never return. She also took away all the clothes and other items in the box and falsely accused him of suffering from a hidden illness. Yusheng stopped having intercourse for two years due to his doctor's orders, and the period has now expired. He is now about to have intercourse. Therefore, he requests mediation for cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo opened the civil court No. 7 to hear Sun Xiu'e's lawsuit for divorce. The plaintiff insisted that the defendant was unable to have intercourse, but Sun Yusheng denied it, saying that he could be inspected. The court ruled that the inspection would be rescheduled before further interrogation.</p>

<p>Accomplices in the 20,000 Yuan Robbery Case</p>
<p>Arrested in a Teahouse</p>
<p>On the 4th of last month, Shen Zhuang, the Shanghai branch of Rugao Gongyu Qianzhuang, located on the upper floor of No. 11 Hengxing West Lane, 16th Pu, Nanshi, was suddenly broken into by five bandits who robbed bank notes worth 20,600 yuan. The competent first district successively captured five bandits, including Xiao Mazi Zhou Huansheng and Qi Lingen (aka Huo Sun Lingen), who confessed that the mastermind was the company's cook, Zhou Xiaotao. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The day before yesterday, Lu Ying, captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly received a tip from a confidential informant that one of the bandits in the case, Ji Bingrong, had distributed the stolen money to acquaintances such as small vendors and coolies in the area of Fangbang Bridge and the Republic Theater at usurious rates, hoping to profit from the interest. Zhou Peisan and Pan Huanzhang, officers of the team, were immediately dispatched to secretly wait at a small teahouse next to the Republic Theater. Before long, Ji, the thief, came swaggering in and took the usurious money from a barber. They immediately rushed forward and arrested him and took him back to the team. During the preliminary hearing by Captain Lu, Ji confessed that his other name was Tianlong, 43 years old, from Wujin, and lived at No. 12 Rongxiang Lane, Songxue Street, in the city. He was originally a tailor. However, he completely denied his involvement in the case. The captain ordered the thief to confront Xiao Mazi and others who had been captured in the first district. Zhou, the thief, identified Ji Bingrong, also known as A Si, as having been invited by Yang Mingchang, the mastermind who was on the run, to rob the bank. When Zhou and others broke into Guangfeng Company, Ji and Xiao Mazi went upstairs together and went straight into Gongyu Qianzhuang. Zhou also forced the victim to hand over the key to open the silver box and rob the banknotes. Ji stood next to him and threatened them with a gun. When Ji was questioned again, the thief bowed his head and said nothing. Since the matter was important, he was ordered to prepare a document and send Ji, the captured thief, to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation yesterday morning. On the other hand, he ordered his subordinates to arrest the mastermind Zhou Xiaotao and the bandit leader Yang Mingchang, who were on the run, and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Murderer Li Zhongxian Admits to Killing</p>
<p>Concluding Arguments Yesterday, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Rong Laosan, a resident of No. 94 Zihua Road, Jiu Mu Di, and a native of Menghe, was stabbed to death by his tenant, Li Zhongxian, on the night of the 23rd of the twelfth lunar month last year for demanding rent without success. The patrol police arrested the murderer and sent him to the police station of the First Station of the Second District and then transferred him to the local court for interrogation and detention. After examination, it was confirmed that Rong Laosan died from knife wounds. The prosecutor's confession was true, and the case was prosecuted to the criminal court. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Luo Renji. First, Rong Jia氏, the wife of the deceased, testified that she was 37 years old and had one son and two daughters, all of whom were young. Her husband, Rong Laosan, was stabbed to death by Li Zhongxian. She requested justice. Her right-hand fingers were also stabbed when she went forward to seize the murder weapon. Even her ring finger and little finger were broken. Next, witness Chen Yonglin testified that he opened a redwood workshop at No. 94 and rented a one-story building to Rong Laosan for 12 yuan per month. Rong then sublet the mezzanine to Li Zhongxian. On the day of the incident, he had already gone to bed. Later, he heard screams for help upstairs. He put on his clothes and rushed upstairs and saw that Rong was dead. Li rushed out the door and ran downstairs. Because he saw Li holding the murder weapon, he did not dare to grab him. He followed him downstairs. The police knocked on the door outside. When he opened the door, Li was arrested by the police and the murder weapon was seized. Next, the murderer Li Zhongxian testified that he was from Shandong, 23 years old, and that he killed him and was not wronged. At this point, lawyer Zhou Yu defended the defendant and asked for leniency. The judge believed that the arguments were concluded and awaited sentencing. Li Zhongxian was returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Request from the International Cultural Research Society for Subsidies from the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Fund <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Request for subsidies to edit the book "Belgium"</p>
<p>The International Cultural Research Society of this city sent a letter yesterday to the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee, stating: "Respectfully submitted, the diplomatic relations between China and Belgium have always been extremely cordial, and the cultural cooperation between the two countries is particularly well-known in the world. Chinese students studying in Belgium every year follow one after another, resulting in a constant stream of talented individuals. Most of them are dedicated to Sino-Belgian endeavors, and the relationship between the two countries is becoming increasingly close. To show its goodwill, Belgium uses a large portion of its returned Boxer Indemnity to engage in cultural and educational undertakings between the two countries, which is managed by your esteemed committee. The members of your esteemed committee, with their broad vision and balanced judgment, are deeply appreciated by all Chinese people. We believe that in order to promote cultural undertakings, publications are necessary for practical communication. Although there are many Chinese students studying in Belgium, very few are dedicated to this field. As a result, the so-called cultural cooperation is only one-sided and not widespread. We have been engaged in publishing for more than ten years and have considerable experience. Recognizing this, we have undertaken the editing of a book entitled "Belgium," which collects as much information as possible on various aspects, such as Belgian politics, education, customs, social practices, study abroad conditions, travel guides, etc., all of which are written into special chapters to contribute to the Chinese people. On the one hand, it will allow the Chinese people to understand the actual situation of Belgium, and at the same time, it will allow future students studying in Belgium to follow the map and obtain what they learn from, which will be of great convenience. Your esteemed committee provides many subsidies for various cultural undertakings of the Chinese people, and you must be optimistic about the success of this kind of publication that practically communicates the culture of the two countries. Moreover, we have heard that the principle of your committee's subsidies is limited to those containing Sino-Belgian relations. This kind of publication is closely related to both China and Belgium and is very much in line with the principle of requesting subsidies. Therefore, we venture to request your esteemed committee to allocate subsidies as funds for the publication of this book, so that after the publication of this book, it can be distributed to various places at home and abroad to engage in the actual promotion of Sino-Belgian culture, which will definitely be of considerable benefit. Then not only will the colleagues be grateful, but the cultural future of China and Belgium will truly benefit from it. Enclosed is the entire book's content and the method of compilation, printing, and claiming funds, as shown on the left. We respectfully request your review and reply." Sincerely, International Cultural Research Society.</p>

<p>Temporary meeting held yesterday</p>
<p>Nominating reorganization committee members</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Suffrage Association held a temporary meeting at the YMCA on Sichuan Road at twelve noon yesterday to discuss expanding the organization into the Chinese Women's Movement Alliance. Fifteen members of the reorganization committee were immediately nominated. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members: More than 20 members attended, including Wang Liming, Qian Jianqiu, Liu Jichen, Li Caixia, Yang Meizhen, Tang Jiawei, Zhu Baoliang, Wang Ruizhu, Xu Danzhi, Hong Jianxia, etc. Wang Liming was immediately nominated as chairman, and Liu Jichen as secretary.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Wang Liming first gave a report, stating briefly: "This association was organized in response to the Beijing Women's Suffrage Association and was established in the tenth year of the Republic of China. The purpose at that time was to obtain women's suffrage. Today, women have the opportunity to participate in politics, which is the result of the association's efforts. Now that we have obtained suffrage, women's education, occupational family issues, and other issues still require us to strengthen the solidarity of women. Looking back at the women's community in our country, there is no solidarity, which is very distressing. Therefore, this association really needs to expand its organization, unite women across the country, and promote the development of the women's movement."</p>
<p>Discussion of Important Cases: Next, the motions were discussed. Wang Liming proposed to change the name of the association to the Chinese Women's Movement Alliance, which was resolved and passed. Li Caixia proposed that a committee be appointed to reorganize the committee, and it was resolved to publicly elect He Xiangning, Wang Liming, Tan Sheying, Liu Jichen, Tang Jiawei, Li Zhishan, Wang Ruiying, Li Caixia, Li Guanying, Guo Zhenyi, Man Ying, Chen Mingyi, Tang Qunying, Yao Kun, etc. as reorganization committee members, and Wang Liming was appointed to draft the reorganization declaration.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The New New Company's Gatekeeper Zhou Zhanyuan's Case of Shooting and Killing Li Minzhou Mentioned Above <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Police Believe Zhou Killed Li with Premeditation</p>
<p>Request to Abolish the Original Sentence of Zhou to Capital Punishment</p>
<p>Zhou Zhanyuan from Tianjin had been working as the deputy head of the gatekeeper at the New New Company on Guizhou Road for eight years. He was dismissed by Li Minzhou, the general manager of the company, on February 1st of this year due to a mistake in his work. Zhou harbored resentment and, at 5:15 p.m. on the same day, took advantage of Li going to room 327 of the New New Hotel to take a bath. He hid a pistol, broke into the room, fired a shot, and hit Li's vital point, causing him to die immediately. Zhou also took the opportunity to escape, fleeing to the Guohua Branch on Beijing Road, where he asked the gatekeeper No. 2139 to borrow travel expenses, intending to flee to the puppet Manchuria. The gatekeeper reported to the police station, and he was arrested and sent to the First Special Court, which sentenced Zhou to life imprisonment for the crime of murder. Since the judgment of this case, the police believe that the original trial did not sentence him to death for premeditated murder, which is not appropriate. Therefore, the police lawyer Gan Jingxian filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The grounds for the appeal listed the defendant's character, the reason for the dismissal, the course of the murder, the preparation for the murder, and the reasons for the appeal, totaling more than a thousand words. In short, it was believed that Zhou's killing of Li was premeditated, stating that Zhou Zhanyuan was usually fierce and addicted to gambling, disloyal to his duties, and committed more than four offenses, which led to Li's dismissal. Zhou handed over all the company's items to the head Zhu Delun, but did not hand over the pistol. He also wandered in the corridor for a long time before killing Li. Afterwards, he knew that the puppet state was a good place to avoid punishment. His intentional murder was self-evident. However, the first instance relied on Zhou's one-sided words and believed that it was not premeditated, which was very inappropriate. Therefore, the appeal was filed, requesting the abolition of the principle and a change of sentence to capital punishment, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu, accompanied by two judges Zhao and Zhou, opened a criminal court to interrogate him. Li Min and Zhou's family also hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to appear in court. After questioning by the court, the court ordered a change of date for further trial.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The First Step of the China-America Tobacco Company's Plan is Successful <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Second Step of the Plan Begins</p>
<p>Dinner for the Press of This City Last Night</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the China-America Tobacco Company, in view of the huge surplus of imported cigarettes, the company adhered to the purpose of promoting domestic products and worked hard to manage the company in order to recover rights. The initial plan was to create two famous brands of cigarettes within six months. So far, the two types of cigarettes, the Blue Major Commander and the Red Major Commander, which have been in operation for six months, have been welcomed for their good quality and low price, and they have indeed sold well in various places as scheduled. The first step of the plan has been successful. The second step of the plan will focus on the recently launched Ginseng brand and the soon-to-be-launched Guanghua brand. The company's general manager Jing Yimeng, associates Wang Yongchang, Yu Zhong'e, and others, in between the success of the first step of the plan and the start of the second step of the plan, yesterday evening specially invited the press of this city to Huaan to a dinner. Those who attended included Zhao Junhao, Ma Chonggan, Sun Enlin, Qian Hua, Jin Huating, Zhu Mingxin, Sun Daosheng from Shen Bao, Yu Kongwo, Jiang Jianhou, Jiang Zongyi, Fan Jingwu, Li Zutang from Xinwen Bao, Hu Hanzhu, Jiang Zongdao from Shibao, Huang Tianpeng, Yuan Xifan, Zhu Manhua from Shishi Xinbao, Xu Xingchu, Xu Zhuodai from Chen Bao, Guan Jiu'an, Wu Zhongyi, Jiang Hongjiao from Min Bao, Yao Tingchun from Da Wan Bao, and more than 30 other people. The company's staff warmly entertained them. During the banquet, General Manager Jing Yimeng reported on the company's organizational history (speech attached below). Next, Xu Zhuodai and Wu Zhongyi delivered thank-you speeches on behalf of the press. Finally, the company presented Red and Blue Major Commander Ginseng and other cigarettes. Jing Yimeng's speech is as follows: "It is an honor to have you here today. Our company was founded in the summer of last year and has only been in operation for more than half a year. It is still in its infancy. Today, we specially invite you to come and guide us, so that we can use it as a compass for future progress. Now, I will report to you the company's situation in the past six months. The establishment of our company was originally of a trial nature. It was initiated with accidental interest, and the initiators were mostly colleagues from Huaan Cooperative Life Insurance Company and Guanghua and Mei Da oil companies. Therefore, it was named Huamei. At that time, there were two trial purposes: First, because various industries are currently in a downturn, although cigarettes are consumer goods, their consumption is so large that it is one of the major industries. The people of our country consume about 200 million yuan on this every year, and 60% of them are produced by foreign tobacco companies, while Chinese merchants only account for 40%. Our colleagues believe that if we can do our best to recover rights and prevent leaks, we will gain an inch or a foot. However, at this time of market downturn, whether we can achieve one in ten thousand effects by fighting the environment, let's use this as a trial. Second, what kind of power is the promotion and development of cigarettes based on? If there is an existing brand, its brand name and the quality of the tobacco leaves are not inferior, but the reason why it cannot be sold well may be due to limited economic relations. Then, can we find a way to revitalize it and make the promotion effective? At that time, the Major Commander brand of cigarettes made by Shanghai Tobacco Company could not be fully developed due to the impact of the January 28th Incident. Therefore, the company transferred the production and sales rights of this brand to our company. Our company is also happy to accept it as a trial. Fortunately, in the past six months, this Major Commander cigarette has been approved by all sectors of society. Its sales volume has increased from 200 boxes per month to 700 boxes, and the quantity purchased by managers in various places has increased monthly, and there is a trend of development. Therefore, colleagues believe that the above two points of the trial are still effective. After this, we should work harder. However, outsiders do not know that because our company is named Huamei, it is suspected that there are foreign shareholders. I don't know that the name of our company is because it was initiated by colleagues from the above-mentioned three companies, so it has this name. The capital is entirely Chinese shares and has been registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in accordance with the law. It can be seen that the rumors from the outside are all false. Also, although the brand name of Major Commander is translated from English, this brand was originally created by Shanghai Tobacco Company, and the company is also a Chinese merchant and a member of the Chinese Cigarette Guild. The brand is now produced and sold by our company, and of course it is still a domestic product. There are outsiders who mistakenly believe that it is a foreign brand, which is a misunderstanding. For the above points, I would like to ask you to explain in the newspapers to dispel public doubts. It would be greatly appreciated. Our company's trial has been slightly successful, so we have expanded our capital since this year and made new brands by ourselves. The Ginseng brand has now been launched, and the Guanghua brand will also be launched soon. I hope that in the era of promoting domestic products, we will do our best to promote the development of domestic products. However, our company's colleagues have very shallow talent and experience. I still ask the gentlemen of the public opinion circle to give us advice at any time. I am very grateful. I would like to propose a toast to wish you good health."</p>
<h3 id="e159">Various Subsidies Proposed by the Municipal Council <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>At the meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors on the 21st, the following subsidies proposed by the Finance Committee were approved, and they will be included in this year's budget: 1. The Salvation Army's Relief Department for Released Prisoners, 5,000 yuan, the same as last year. 2. The Women and Children's Relief Association (an organization to prevent kidnapping), 28,000 yuan, the same as last year. 3. The Asiatic Society, in addition to the annual 4,200 yuan and 1,400 yuan, will be given an additional 1,400 yuan for the work of the society at the new site, totaling 7,000 yuan. 4. The Boy Scout Association, 700 yuan, the same as last year. 5. The Girl Scout Association, 420 yuan, the same as last year. In addition, the following were decided by the joint proposal of the Finance and Health Committees: 1. Guangren Hospital, 7,000 yuan, because the number of people sent by the police to the hospital for treatment has greatly increased, so the above amount is added from 4,000 taels. 2. Pushan Mountain Jiang, 10,000 yuan, the same as last year. 3. Jiangwan Jingchang (transliteration) Memorial Hospital, which handles tuberculosis treatment and plans to add a neurological department, requested a subsidy. It was decided to investigate the hospital's situation and scope of work, and how the French Concession and the Chinese area will subsidize it will be decided later. 4. Tongren Hospital plans to rebuild on Dixiwei Road. Because it is outside the boundary, it is specially asked whether the subsidy will be affected. According to the opinions of the Health Department and the Police Department, if it moves to that location, the number of patients in the boundary will inevitably decrease. It seems difficult to continue to subsidize the old number (20,000 yuan last year). Or the hospital can be rebuilt on the Yangshupu Road site. As a result, it was decided to notify the hospital that if the move to the new site affects the hospital's service to the Municipal Council, the subsequent subsidies should be determined according to the service situation.</p>

<p>The Electrical Industry Association repeatedly petitioned the Public Utilities Bureau for the harsh restrictions of the water and electricity company's regulations, requesting the bureau to order the power plant to amend them. The Public Utilities Bureau replied that the contract must be signed first, and after a considerable period of time, if there are indeed difficulties in fact, it will be transferred for amendment. After receiving the reply from the Electrical Appliance Association, it immediately convened a meeting of the industry to discuss and decide to continue to petition, requesting amendments. It also immediately nominated Ding Dixing, Li Henglin, Yu Mingxun, Qian Fengyi, and other four people as representatives to go to the Public Security Bureau yesterday to meet with the director and request permission to order the power plant to amend them. The director delegated Wang, the section staff, to meet with them. First, the representatives successively stated the harsh restrictions in the regulations and reported them in detail one by one. Next, they stated the reasons why they could not sign the contract. Finally, they made three requests: (1) The power plant notified the industry to send the signed contract to the factory before the 31st of this month, otherwise it would stop accepting installation orders. On this point, it is requested that the power plant be informed that the old regulations will remain in the factory during the amendment period of the new regulations, and the acceptance of installation orders shall not be stopped. (1) The new regulations are allowed to be amended. (2) Please convene both parties to discuss the points. Wang, the section staff, stated that the requests would be accepted. The first and third points can be done. The second point will be reported to the director according to the situation so as not to disappoint everyone. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Two Examples of Encouraging the Song Dynasty Canon <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Since the launch of the pre-order for the reproduction of the Song Dynasty Qisha Edition of the Great Canon, each copy is only priced at 525 yuan, which is less than one-tenth of the price of the Qing Dynasty Dragon Canon printed in Beiping. Therefore, famous temples, major libraries, and book collectors have paid to order from the Shanghai (714 Weihaiwei Road) Reproduction of the Song Edition Canon Association. Among them, there are two examples of pooling funds, which can be used as models for those who have faith and willingness but lack the financial resources to follow suit. They are recorded as follows: (A) Hongyi Chan Returns to the Record of Xiamen Poor Children Donating Funds to Request the Song Dynasty Canon: In June of the 22nd year of the summer calendar, the Miaoshi Temple in Xiamen raised funds to request the Song Dynasty Qisha Canon. After it was advocated, on the 15th, a poor mother brought her son to the monk's room and donated one yuan, saying that she wanted to help request the Song Dynasty Canon with this. When asked who gave it, she said the child gave it. When asked how the one yuan was obtained, she said the mother often gave the child one penny to ask for what he needed. The child did not waste it, but gathered and stored it. The mother gave it many times, and over the years, it became one penny, gradually filling one yuan. He had kept it in his arms for a long time, regarding it as a treasure. Today, he accompanied his mother to the temple to worship Buddha. When he heard others say that they were raising funds to request the Song Dynasty Canon, he was delighted and danced, praising it as a great opportunity. So he gave up what he treasured and rejoiced. The child was wearing torn clothes, barefoot without shoes, and had not yet reached childhood. His name was Wu Yi. Written by Shamen Hongyi Yinyin in the first month of Jiaxu. (B) The Guangxi Guiping Buddhist Research Society's Method of Encouraging the Request of the Song Dynasty Canon: (1) Initiated by the Guiping Buddhist Research Society, requesting the purchase of a Tibetan of the Shanghai reproduced Song Dynasty Qisha Sutras, totaling 6,310 volumes (1) The funds for requesting the sutras will be raised by the Buddhist Research Society issuing donation books to encourage subscriptions (1) The donation procedures are in accordance with the Forty-Eight Vows of Amitabha Buddha. Forty-eight donation books will be printed, one for each vow. Each book is limited to a donation of 25 cents (this is the Guangxi cent silver conversion, so this number is required). Those who receive the donation book must donate at least one yuan. The remaining 48 people will donate 50 cents each to complete one vow. However, for convenience, the person who receives the book can design and encourage donations at will, and must complete the vow (1) The donation receipt is first stamped by the Buddhist Research Society, and then signed and stamped by the handler (1) The deadline for returning the donation book is one month from the date of receipt, so that it can be remitted early and fulfill the pre-order (1) In addition to properly arranging the scriptures this time, the remaining funds will print the names of the kind men and women into a booklet according to the amount of donation, together with the scriptures, to be immortalized. Those who donate more than 5 yuan will be sent back a booklet, along with a scripture reading ticket, as a souvenir. Those who donate 50 cents up to 5 yuan will only be sent a scripture reading ticket and not a name list to save money. As for those who take on the responsibility of encouraging donations or donate one vow or more by themselves, in addition to sending booklets and tickets, the fundraising committee will present a silver-plated Amitabha Buddha commemorative badge, and those who recognize five to ten vows or more will be invited to take photos of the donors to hang on the Sutra Library to commemorate and promote virtue forever.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Thirty Cigarette Factories Send Letter to Association, Urging Swift Change to Cigarette Tax System <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after twenty-four locally owned cigarette factories in this city jointly petitioned the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance, Tax Affairs Administration, to change the new cigarette tax system, the Tax Affairs Administration immediately sent a letter to the city's Cigarette Factory Trade Association for a reply. Now, the following thirty factories:</p>
<p>Minzhong Tobacco Company, Yuxin Tobacco Factory, Datongnan Tobacco Company, Huaqing Tobacco Company, Jinsha Tobacco Factory, Huadong Tobacco Company, Jiangzhejian Company, Guochang Tobacco Company, Kefu Tobacco Company, Ximen Tobacco Company, Fuxin Tobacco Company, Huaxing Tobacco Company, Huamei Tobacco Company, Asia Tobacco Company, Shanghai Tobacco Company, Dada Tobacco Factory, Delong Tobacco Company, Xinmin Tobacco Company, Huapin Tobacco Company, Daxing Tobacco Company, Youli Tobacco Company, Changming Tobacco Company, Fuchang Tobacco Company, Jinshan Tobacco Company, Huafu Tobacco Company, Yonghe Tobacco Company, Jiuyi Tobacco Factory, Jiangnan Tobacco Company, Meixing Tobacco Company, and Minsheng Tobacco Company, have jointly prepared a letter of opinion and submitted it to the Trade Association, requesting that it promptly reply to the Tax Affairs Administration to improve the tax rate as soon as possible. The full text of the letter of opinion is as follows: Regarding the proposal, after investigating the joint petition from twenty-four tobacco companies, including Minzhong, regarding the current unequal treatment of Chinese and foreign cigarette taxes, we request a swift revision of the tax grades to provide relief. The Ministry of Finance, Tax Affairs Administration, has now sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Factory Trade Association for a reply. This case is of great importance to the survival of the Chinese cigarette industry. Ziping and others have repeatedly studied it and believe that the statistical tables submitted by Minzhong and other companies are based on the statistical bulletin and tax bulletin compiled by the Tax Affairs Administration. Since these bulletins are issued by the Tax Affairs Administration, the numbers listed are certainly accurate. According to this statistic, changing from a three-tier tax to a two-tier tax not only creates unequal treatment for Chinese and foreign companies but also greatly reduces government tax revenue. In the era of the three-tier tax, British and American cigarette sales used 30,472 stamps. In the era of the two-tier tax, they used 48,808 stamps. According to the unified tax regulations, one stamp is used for each box of cigarettes. Therefore, in the era of the two-tier tax, the number of British and American cigarette taxes increased by 18,336 boxes compared to the era of the three-tier tax, an increase of more than 50%. If the government still collects taxes according to the three-tier tax rate, without any reduction, tax revenue will definitely increase by more than 50%. In the era of the three-tier tax, the average monthly tax payment for British and American companies was more than 2.41 million yuan. If we conservatively estimate an increase of 50%, the monthly increase should be more than 1.2 million yuan. Therefore, the monthly tax payment for British and American companies should be more than 3.61 million yuan. However, according to the facts, in the era of the two-tier tax, the average monthly tax payment for British and American companies is only more than 2.72 million yuan. Comparing the two, the government actually collects 890,000 yuan less each month. This is the result of the tax reduction on high-end cigarettes. From this perspective, with the three-tier tax changed to a two-tier tax, the government collects 890,000 yuan less per month from British and American companies, and 10.68 million yuan less per year. Can it be said that this is not a loss for the government? If we talk about Chinese companies, in the era of the three-tier tax, other tobacco companies used 68,422 cigarette stamps. In the era of the two-tier tax, they used 44,323 stamps. Therefore, in the era of the two-tier tax, the number of cigarette sales of other tobacco companies decreased by about one-third. If the government still collects taxes according to the three-tier tax rate, without any reduction, tax revenue will naturally decrease by one-third. In the era of the three-tier tax, the average monthly tax payment for other tobacco companies was more than 2 million yuan. If it decreases by one-third, it should decrease by more than 660,000 yuan, which should be more than 1.34 million yuan. However, according to the facts, in the era of the two-tier tax, the average monthly tax payment for other tobacco companies is actually more than 2.55 million yuan. Comparing the two, Chinese companies increase their burden by 1.21 million yuan per month, and a total increase of 14.52 million yuan per year. This is the result of the tax increase on low-end cigarettes. Based on this comprehensive calculation, after the implementation of the two-tier tax, British and American cigarette sales have increased by an average of two-fifths, but the tax revenue has decreased by 10.68 million yuan throughout the year. Chinese cigarette sales have decreased by an average of one-third, but the tax revenue has increased by 14.52 million yuan throughout the year. Can it be said that this is not unequal treatment for Chinese and foreign companies? At this time of suppressing bandits and building the nation,</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants, for the Party and the Nation, Increase the Burden, We Dare Not Refuse. However, based on the above figures, the government collects 14.52 million yuan more from Chinese companies throughout the year, but collects 10.68 million yuan less from British and American companies. Therefore, by changing from a three-tier tax to a two-tier tax, the government's income is only 3.84 million yuan throughout the year, while British and American companies' income is actually 10.68 million yuan, almost three times the government's income. As a result of the two-tier tax, in terms of the entire cigarette tax, Chinese companies are the victims, British and American companies account for 75% of the beneficiaries, and the government only accounts for 25%. In terms of the government's tax revenue from British and American companies, the government is the complete victim, while British and American companies are the beneficiaries. Alas, Chinese companies are exhausted and bear more than 14.5 million yuan in heavy taxes throughout the year. If every drop belongs to the government, what can we say? Now, British and American companies are allowed to enjoy a profit of 10.68 million yuan every year, which is tantamount to extracting the blood and sweat of Chinese companies to supply British and American companies. British and American companies take advantage of this opportunity to extract the income of Chinese companies and drastically reduce prices to encroach on the market. Therefore, in one year, the quantity of cigarettes produced by British and American companies has suddenly increased by 50%, while Chinese companies have closed down one after another, from 150-160 companies to 40-50 companies. Although the loss of Chinese companies' taxes is only more than 14.5 million yuan, the loss of business is unknown by how many millions of yuan. Although the benefit of British and American companies' taxes is only more than 10 million yuan, the profit of business is again unknown by how many millions. However, this is still only in terms of the cigarette industry. If we talk about domestic tobacco leaves, the loss is also not small. Low-end cigarettes are all made of domestic leaves. Low-end cigarettes are not competitive due to heavy taxes, and domestic tobacco leaves will inevitably be unsalable. According to the statistics of Minzhong and other tobacco companies, the domestic tobacco leaves produced in Susong, Huanggang, Xinchang, Dengzhou, Guanshui, and Junzhou amounted to about 390,000 packages per year during the seven-tier tax era before 1930. After the three-tier tax was changed in November 1930, it decreased to 260,000 packages. After the two-tier tax was changed in 1932, it decreased again to 115,000 packages. Recently, after the tax was changed, it was heard that this tobacco leaf</p>
<p>Is Almost Unattended. Jiujiang and Laohekou Tax Affairs Administrations have established offices for domestic tobacco. We plan to forward a letter to the Tax Affairs Administration, ordering them to investigate and respond, and we will be able to obtain the truth. Under the current tax system, domestic tobacco is taxed at 4.14 yuan per 100 jin. If it is not sold because of this, what is the loss of government tax revenue? How much does the rural economy lose when tobacco farmers go bankrupt as a result? This is also not something that can be calculated with numbers. I believe that the mistake of the two-tier tax is entirely due to the tax reduction on high-end cigarettes and the tax increase on low-end cigarettes. High-end cigarettes are expensive, and low-end cigarettes are cheap. In terms of the seven-tier tax, the selling price of each box of high-end cigarettes is 1052 yuan, and the tax is 404 yuan. The selling price of each box of seven-tier cigarettes is 125 yuan, and the tax is 29 yuan. This is based on the principle of equal taxation, taxing according to value. The tax on one box of high-end cigarettes is enough to offset more than a dozen boxes of low-end cigarettes. Therefore, in order to have sufficient tax revenue, even if we do not focus on high-end cigarettes, we must treat high, medium, and low-end cigarettes equally. We must never focus solely on low-end cigarettes. Now, let us assume that the government must raise 3.8 million yuan in cigarette tax. If it does not solely blame the low-end cigarettes of Chinese merchants and also lets the high-end cigarettes of British and American companies share the burden, then let us take a step back and calculate at half of each. Chinese merchants only need to increase their burden by 1.9 million yuan. Why should they bear the heavy tax of more than 14 million yuan? If we say that regardless of the people's ability to pay, Chinese merchants must bear more than 14 million yuan in taxes, and British and American companies must also bear the same amount, then British and American cigarette sales are more than those of Chinese merchants, and what they sell are expensive high-end cigarettes. If we increase the tax according to value, the tax payment of British and American companies will simultaneously increase by more than 30 million yuan. The government's income can then increase by 50 million yuan annually. Therefore, for the sake of increasing tax revenue, the government must levy the same tax on high, medium, and low-end cigarettes. The principle is very simple. As for the two-tier tax, the tax increase on low-end cigarettes is too heavy, and the tax rate on high-end cigarettes is too light, only causing endless losses to Chinese merchants,</p>
<p>While British and American Companies Enjoy Huge Profits. It can truly be said to have hundreds of harms and not a single benefit. However, this is still in terms of the two-tier tax of 1932. If we consider the current two-tier tax, first-tier cigarettes are extremely rare, almost zero. What is actually collected is only the second tier, which is equivalent to only one tax grade. The price of low-end cigarettes has increased from 55 yuan per box to 80 yuan per box, which is even more than before. The price of high-end cigarettes has decreased from 95 yuan per box to 80 yuan per box, which is less than before. It has not been implemented for long now. What are the losses of Chinese merchants? What are the benefits of British and American companies? We have not obtained clear statistical figures. However, based on previous methods, the loss of Chinese merchants should be more than 20 million yuan per year, and the benefit of British and American companies should be at least 16-17 million yuan. If we must continue to implement it, we will see that these remaining 40-50 Chinese companies will also close down one after another, and all domestic tobacco leaves will be eliminated. Tobacco farmers in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui will then go bankrupt. Therefore, it is urgent to catch up and abolish it immediately, without allowing any hesitation. Some say that, as mentioned above, under the current tax system, low-end cigarettes are taxed at 80 yuan per box, and high and medium-end cigarettes are appropriately increased according to grade. Isn't this a clever trick to raise funds? Then, I think not. The tax of 80 yuan per box on low-end cigarettes is a heavy tax of 120% of the value, which the people cannot afford at this time. In recent years, Chinese merchants have closed down one after another, which is the result of low-end cigarettes being unable to bear the heavy tax. If we impose a heavy tax of 120% of the value on high and medium-end cigarettes, we are ordering the entire tobacco industry to perish together. The government and tobacco merchants will both suffer. There is no feasible reason. The only plan is to adopt the principle of equal burden for high, medium, and low-end cigarettes, and the tax rate should be handled moderately. The newly set two-tier tax rate, with high-end cigarettes at 36% of the value and low-end cigarettes at 120% of the value, is both too light and too heavy. If we appropriately change it to a uniform 50-60% of the value, the burden on tobacco merchants will be relatively fair. The government's tax revenue will decrease on low-end cigarettes, but it will greatly increase on high and medium-end cigarettes, which will benefit the national treasury. The public association does not have accurate records of the selling price and sales volume of various cigarette brands. The government has not announced them either. Ziping and others</p>
<p>Have No Way to Calculate Based On. The Tax Affairs Administration should have accurate registration. If we negotiate based on this principle, we will be able to set a fair and appropriate tax rate. As for what the Tax Affairs Administration's letter emphasizes, there are a total of three points: (1) Whether the tax revenue is affected; (2) Whether the opinions of the industry are consistent; (3) Whether there are obstacles to the implementation in practice. Ziping and others have repeatedly discussed this and respectfully answered as follows: (1) Whether the tax revenue is affected. As mentioned earlier, the failure of the two-tier tax lies in the tax reduction on high-end cigarettes. Therefore, the income from the tax increase on low-end cigarettes must still make up for the loss of the tax reduction on high-end cigarettes. Although the burden on Chinese merchants is heavy, the government does not benefit from it, because British and American companies enjoy the benefit of a tax reduction of more than 10 million yuan every year. If we break the idea of benefiting from the tax reduction on high-end cigarettes and appropriately increase the tax rate on high and medium-end cigarettes, then the benefit of the tax reduction that British and American companies have enjoyed every year must be returned to the government. We will see the daily increase in tax revenue. How can there be any talk of affecting tax revenue? (2) Whether the opinions of the industry are consistent. People's hearts are different, and each has its own face. It is impossible for the opinions of the industry to be consistent in fact. Let's try to make an analogy. Most Chinese people do not approve of the establishment of Manchukuo, but Zheng Xiaoxu and Shi Yousan, who were attached to the puppet regime, are also Chinese people. It is impossible for the world to say that Zheng Shi's attachment to the puppet regime means that the Chinese people are not consistent and should recognize Manchukuo. Therefore, when discussing the cigarette tax rate, we should only ask whether it is in line with the principle of fairness and whether it is harmless to our country's agriculture, industry, and commerce. We do not need to ask whether the industry is consistent. If a tax rate is in line with the principle of fairness and does not harm our country's industry, it should be adopted. Otherwise, it should be abolished. Whether the industry is consistent is not important. If it is said that it must be consistent, then under the current two-tier tax, twenty-four cigarette companies in Shanghai, including Minzhong, do not agree with it. Cigarette companies in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and other provinces have also opposed it one after another. It should have been abolished long ago. Therefore, this section does not need to be discussed. (3) Whether there are obstacles to the implementation in practice. This is probably due to concerns about the opposition of British and American companies. It is actually not worth worrying about. Before the establishment of the National Government, tariffs were restricted to 5% of the value. After the tariff autonomy, this unequal treaty has been broken. The consolidated tax is an internal tax. In the era of diplomatic failure of the Qing Dynasty, internal taxes were never interfered with by foreigners. China is originally an autonomous country. No matter how strong foreign merchants are, they can never interfere with internal taxes. Even based on the agreement between the Tax Affairs Administration and British and American companies, it only states that they must receive the same treatment as Chinese factories. There is no special preferential clause. If we set a fair tax rate that is consistent for Chinese and foreign companies and taxes according to value, we do not need to worry about foreigners making excuses. The above is what Ziping and others have thoroughly studied and agreed on. Now that the Tax Affairs Administration is soliciting the opinions of tobacco merchants and the members' meeting is studying the tax rate, it is reasonable to prepare a letter of opinion and submit it to the meeting, hoping that you will carefully review it, reply to the Tax Affairs Administration, and strive to improve the tax rate as soon as possible to save Chinese merchants from hanging upside down. The industry will be very grateful. This is addressed to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association Members' Meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Match Industry Association Requests Deferral of Consolidated Tax Advance Payment <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Huge Advance Payment Leads to Financial Circulation Problems</p>
<p>Another Letter to the Tax Affairs Administration, Requesting Accommodation and Approval</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance increased the consolidated tax on matches, the National Match Industry Trade Association, due to its difficult situation and inability to comply with the order, has again sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Affairs Administration. The original text is recorded as follows: We respectfully reply that we recently received Letter No. 2576 from your department, which roughly stated that regarding our association's previous letter requesting that the date for recording tax payments be appropriately extended, the tax payment recording was originally scheduled for the 25th of each month, which is already an extraordinary accommodation. At this time of extreme treasury shortage, even in terms of military supplies, it is difficult to cope with adequately. If the tax payments due from each of the tax-paying manufacturers can be recorded for as long as three months, once this precedent is set, how can we take care of the national treasury expenditure? The request is not approved, etc. Upon receiving this, the case was not approved, and we should obey. However, the match industry has been declining in recent years due to the dumping of foreign-made matches and the unlimited establishment of factories. The current increase in the consolidated tax on matches is almost one and a half times the old tax. The burden on match manufacturers has suddenly increased. Match factories with smaller capital are facing even greater operating difficulties due to financial circulation problems. This is truly insufficient to provide relief. Our association is not unaware of the current treasury shortage and the huge amount of military supplies. Therefore, after the tax increase was implemented, although we knew that it would be difficult for all members to shoulder this burden, we did not rashly request to withdraw the decision. However, recently, all members have been stretched thin and unable to maintain operations. We had no choice but to request an extension of the tax payment recording date. Our association and all members believe that this method can slightly help in terms of manufacturers' capital operation without affecting government tax revenue. It is truly a comprehensive and prudent method. However, we have still failed to receive accommodation and approval. If all members are exhausted and forced to close down one after another in the future, then hundreds of thousands of match workers will suddenly become unemployed, which is not a blessing for the country or society. At the same time, the collection of consolidated tax on matches will also be affected, which is far from the original intention of your department to increase taxes. Our association is a united group of match industries across the country. We have a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of this matter. We dare not use alarming words to scare people. The above is all factual information. We especially do not avoid bothering you and submit another letter, earnestly requesting your department to carefully observe the facts, carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages, and still approve the tax payment recording date to be appropriately extended. If this method is truly difficult to accommodate and approve, please also devise other relief methods to open a line of survival for match manufacturers, so that more than a hundred match factories will not close down and hundreds of thousands of match workers will not become unemployed. The country will be fortunate, and the match industry will be fortunate. We are extremely eager to await your orders. This is addressed to the Ministry of Finance Tax Affairs Administration, respectfully submitted by the National Match Industry United Association of China.</p>

<p>Yesterday and the day before, the problem was raised, and a little criticism was added to Mr. Fang's viewpoint. Today, we will further study the method, but first, we should still discuss the principles. Tomorrow, we will apply the principles to the dissection of the problem. Editor</p>
<p>Before proposing how to study the Northeast problem, we want to especially ask readers to pay attention to why we accept the review of this problem; why not ask you to read books, but instead talk about this old account that the Chinese people are familiar with? We have already briefly mentioned the reason in the front, and now we want to repeat it, just hoping to arouse those of you who are learning social sciences to apply the theories you have learned to practical problems after pondering and contemplating. Here, we are just acting as an example, suggesting some methods of application. Naturally, we cannot analyze in more detail, nor can we say that there are no shortcomings. This is due to the limitations of the length and the interests of this column. At the same time, we are not writing articles here, discussing "national affairs," expressing great opinions. We are just taking the attitude of a "teacher"—if it is not too presumptuous—to lead "students"—these two words are not very appropriate either, please readers do not laugh at our arrogance—to practice. However, although it is practice, it cannot be careless at all, and we still treat everything with a serious attitude as if it were a valuable thing. We hope that in the future, the readers of this column will all try to do the same work, apply the theories they have learned to dissect and criticize a specific political, economic, or social problem, or apply them to a famous work, a famous novel, a play, a film, a suicide, "love," "plagiarism," "kidnapping," and so on, to verify what you have learned and strengthen your power of understanding.</p>
<p>Having explained the above, we believe that readers will feel more cordial when reading the following text.</p>
<p>Now let's return to the case study of the Northeast problem.</p>
<p>There are naturally many methods to study the Northeast problem. But they can be roughly summarized into two types: one method is to observe from a static, isolated, and subjective perspective; the other is to observe from a dynamic, process-oriented, connected, and objective perspective. In each of these two methods, because some people focus on a certain aspect, or mechanically apply the rules, different conclusions can also be drawn, resulting in very chaotic phenomena. However, those who truly grasp the essence of science will not be confused by this chaotic phenomenon.</p>
<p>Let's briefly talk about the first method of observation.</p>
<p>Many advanced Chinese scholars believe that the occurrence of the Northeast problem is due to the ambition of the Japanese militarists; and it is only a local problem in China. Therefore, they hope that the Japanese military will realize their mistakes, hope that the Japanese proletariat will rise up in revolution, hope that the League of Nations will uphold justice, and hope that the people will remain calm, slowly making the Japanese realize their mistakes, and hope to seek a solution through diplomatic channels. Another group of smarter scholars even want to lure Japan to attack the Soviet Union, in order to reduce Japanese oppression. They believe that the Japanese are encroaching step by step because the "bandits" have betrayed the nation and dispersed the anti-Japanese forces. They believe that there is no possibility of resisting Japan at present, and at least ten years must be waited (as Dr. Hu Shi said). Therefore, now we can only talk about construction and cultivating national strength.</p>
<p>For these gentlemen's high opinions, naturally, there is no need to spend any more effort to explain them here. Iron facts have already exposed their hypocrisy. However, these "high opinions," no matter how naive and absurd, are not without reason. It is still a conclusion under a certain method of observation. Although it is the interests of their group that determine them to adopt this view, this view can paralyze many young people who are pursuing the truth. For example, Mr. Fang is undoubtedly one of them.</p>
<p>The second method of observation is to observe the occurrence, development, and solution of the problem in the following relationships:</p>
<p>(1) In the mutual relationship of the international (referring to the capitalist system), that is, in the opposition between imperialism and imperialist countries, more specifically, in the deepening of the world economic panic and the struggle for power among the imperialists in the Pacific, to understand the basis for the occurrence of this problem.</p>
<p>(2) Understand the crisis of the Chinese nation in the relationship of opposition between imperialism and colonies.</p>
<p>(3) Understand the anti-Soviet war and the suppression of the Chinese national revolutionary movement in the relationship of opposition between the two major systems of capitalism and socialism.</p>
<p>The Northeast problem is a product of the synthesis of the above three groups of oppositions. To study the Northeast problem, not only can we not take the first subjective form of research method, but also we cannot only take any part of the second research method and mechanically apply it. Because the complexity of the Northeast problem is precisely caused by the intersection of these three groups of oppositions. Only by understanding this complexity, understanding the basis for creating this complexity, can we talk about correctly studying the Northeast and recognizing the seriousness of this problem. Only then can we talk about how to correctly lead the Chinese people to resist Japan and save the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to simply grasp the root cause of the problem, because recent international events are constantly changing. Although the opposition of these three groups is still sharply reflected in the Northeast and the whole of China, it is also very sensitive to reflect on this problem due to changes in the balance of world economic, political, and social forces. This makes the problem even more complicated. This is very easy to understand. Compared with the day of "September 18th" and now, the relationship at that time was naturally simpler than now, and its seriousness is not as frightening as it is now. When we study the Northeast problem today, we must also judge the relationship of the past few years on top of it, so that the problem can be understood in the most realistic way.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief indication of some principles. Below, we will apply the above principles to the problem itself and implement the dissection of the problem itself. At the same time, in order to make it easier for readers to understand, in the writing of the dissection, we will specifically put forward the wonderful arguments of formal observers as a comparison and send them to the yesterday of the times.

<h3 id="e170">Letter <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor, Yesterday I read a news item in your newspaper's local news column about a dispute over the use of private houses to run a nursery. It said, "The day before yesterday, Yang Maorong even accompanied the patrol officer of the Second District, Second Precinct to force the tenants to move out, causing dissatisfaction among the tenants and arousing public anger. It is now learned that the tenants have united to deal with the situation, etc." I am very surprised. The houses at Nos. 1 to 7 Pinfang Lane were originally municipal property, not private houses. The Children's Welfare Committee had already submitted a request to the municipal government to allocate them for the establishment of a nursery. The Second District, Second Precinct had notified the tenants of these houses twice on the 3rd and 21st of last month to move out within a month. On the 10th of this month, the Finance Bureau also sent staff members Cheng Fengyun and Hu Jixing, accompanied by Patrol Officer Tu of the Second District, Second Precinct, and Maorong, to hand over and take over the houses and verbally informed the tenants to move out as scheduled so that the nursery could be opened as soon as possible. This is a matter of handling affairs according to regulations and is imperative. There was no coercion at the time, and there was no arousal of public anger. However, your newspaper reported that the use of private houses aroused public anger. It is regrettable that it hinders personal reputation is a small matter, but the impact on the opening of the nursery and the obstruction of the development of public welfare is great. I am writing to request a correction. Yours sincerely, Yang Maorong, March 22nd.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor, I read in your newspaper on the 21st of this month the conversation of Mr. Lang Guanpu, saying, "The old troops of Ma Zhanshan have gradually been reorganized by others, and only Tan Zixin's 2,000 or so men remain, now stationed in Henan and under the command of Liu Zhi, etc." Jianhua came to Shanghai from Henan Province not long ago. General Tan's troops fought bloody battles in the Northeast for many years. Last winter, they were reorganized by the Central Government into a division. Recently, due to financial difficulties, more than 2,000 men were cut off. The name is the 10th Cavalry Division, which is currently suppressing bandits on the front line. The relationship with the officials and people of Henan Province is very good. Jianhua was stationed in the headquarters of the division when he was in Henan and knows a lot about it. What Mr. Lang said is too far from the truth, and I am afraid it will lead to misunderstandings from the outside world. I have to trouble the esteemed editor to grant a correction. Thank you, thank you. Yours respectfully, Tao Jianhua.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e171">Rising at Dawn <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>In this era when the long night is still long and dawn is yet to come, someone has actually initiated a dawn movement. The reason is that rising at dawn allows one to absorb a few breaths of fresh air, storing them in the belly, so as not to be timid and sluggish when doing things.</p>
<p>Indeed, after China has rejuvenated from an old empire to become a youthful China, naturally, everything should be vigorous and energetic, so as not to fall behind and be swallowed by the times.</p>
<p>The so-called vigor naturally means that when doing things, one should avoid being fussy and should not groan without illness.</p>
<p>The plan for the year lies in spring, and the plan for the day lies in the morning. Rising at dawn is naturally a great principle. However, since rising at dawn has become a movement, then I think it should also set some work after rising at dawn, and it does not seem to be limited to sweeping the courtyard, practicing a few sets of Taijiquan, or proclaiming a burst of Amitabha Buddha's name, or, like people of leisure, taking a lark or hibiscus to the City God Temple for tea. In my humble opinion, it is better not to initiate a dawn movement. If you want to initiate a dawn movement, you should move the office hours to sunrise. Because at that time, the earth is full of vigor, and everyone works in the strong vigor, and the service spirit will naturally be nurtured in the vigor, and everything will be seen as having a vigorous spirit. - This is always much better than rising at dawn, enjoying the vigor, storing the vigor in the belly and slowly exhaling it again, and dissolving it into the work. This is stronger than the rule of holding morning meetings on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and being punished if you are absent three times, because although morning meetings are held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, it is inevitable to stay in bed grandiosely. What is this all about?</p>
<p>In the old monarchical era, good emperors were the ones who went to court at 3 a.m. with palace maids holding red gauze lanterns. From then on, the emperor did not go to court early, and from then on, there were many troubles in the world. It can be seen that rising at dawn is indeed very reasonable.</p>
<p>The long night is still long, and dawn is yet to come. When dawn arrives, let us all rise up and strive forward in the vigor.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Feces! <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Old Farmer</p>
<p>This may surprise everyone, we eat feces every day, but I want to ask; can we go without rice for a day, or without vegetables for a day? If your answer is "no," then I conclude that you must be eating feces, because most of the things we eat every day are grown with feces and urine.</p>
<p>Our country has been using feces and urine as fertilizer for thousands of years. Except for the young masters and ladies who live in the city and do not know the five grains, probably everyone knows this.</p>
<p>The economic value of feces and urine is staggering. According to the statistics of Professor J.H. Reisner of Jinling University, our country can produce 428.12 million pounds of human feces every year. If two-thirds of it is used as fertilizer, it will be 285.42 million pounds, which is about 214 million dan. If each dan is calculated at an average of one jiao, it is already worth 21.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Of course, farmers are the ones who live directly on feces, but there are also many merchants who make a fortune from feces. It is said that Wuxi has a particularly large number of outhouses, which is how they make a living. It is said that a family with three outhouses can be free from hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Recently, science has become increasingly prosperous, and the effectiveness of feces has also gradually increased. A famous German scientist named Sindermann has made useful and edible things such as ammonium sulfate, gas, carbon dioxide, pine oil, and fat from feces.</p>
<p>Everyone should no longer look down on human feces. The effectiveness of feces is really great. People generally call feces "golden juice," which is not too much of an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Poets are always lonely and arrogant, hating evil as if it were an enemy. If their actions are occasionally improper, the whole world will slander and scold them. Both gentlemen have the heart of a child, and their misfortunes are similar. Is there no joy in their lives? They avoid others for fear of being implicated. - This has caused these unparalleled people to die at the hands of vulgar men! (Both poets died in duels) When I read the poems of both gentlemen, tears often fill my sleeves: Although the words are indeed beautiful, they cannot understand the stench of the crowd. I feel even more sad for myself - my heartfelt words can be cursed!</p>
<h3 id="e175">Research on Inkstones (7) <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Wuliaoke</p>
<p>Overview of Duan Inkstones</p>
<p>The essence of inkstones, as mentioned earlier, is that among the inkstones in various places, the three types of Duan, She, and Cheng are the most important. Now, let's first discuss these three types, and of course, we must first talk about Duan.</p>
<p>(1) The Difference between Water Rock and Mountain Pit. From the beginning of mining in the early Tang Dynasty to the last excavation by Zhang Zhidong in the Qing Dynasty, there are many records of the years and times of mining and the names of each pit. Those who have studied inkstones a little all know this, so there is no need to repeat them. Generally, the ones opened in the Tang and Song dynasties were: Xia Yan, Zhong Yan, Shang Yan, Long Yan, Half-Mountain Rocks, Bang Pit, Later Licha Garden, General Pit, and Small Xiangxia.</p>
<p>The ones opened in the Ming and Qing dynasties were: Da Xi Dong, Zheng Dong, Xiao Xi Dong, Dong Dong (with Gong Peng, Dong Zi, Miao Wei), all called Shui Yan, which is the Xia Yan called in the Tang and Song dynasties. In addition, those in Xiana, such as Kengzi Yan, Lao Yan, Xuande Yan, Chaotian Yan, Feishu Yan, Wenshu Pit, and Gutayan Pingfengbei, etc., and those in Xianbei, such as Longzhao Yan, Chaojing Yan, and Apokeng, etc., and those in Beiling, such as Baixian Yan, Chanchu Pit, Song Pit, Meihua Pit, and Jinyun Pit, etc., and those on the west bank, such as Su Pit, Dakengtou, and Huwei Pit, etc., are all called Shan Keng. (Only the more famous ones are recorded for Shan Keng)</p>
<p>What I want to talk about now is the first question, which is the difference between Shui Yan and Shan Keng. The Japanese scholar Kogawa Masazakura said in his Inkstone Tan: "Japanese connoisseurs can all recognize the difference between Shui Yan and Shan Keng, but few can further distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of each stone in Shan Keng. If you want to go further and be able to distinguish which is Zheng Dong, which is Dong Dong, and which is Da Xi Xiao Xi in Shui Yan, there are even fewer. As for pointing out which layer of stone each stone in Shui Yan is, it is even more impossible." This is indeed not an easy task. Not to mention Japan, even in our country, only a few elegant officials and literati who personally went to the mountains to purchase and the workers in Huanggang who made a living by opening pits and making inkstones can distinguish them. Since ancient times, there have been many writings discussing the quality and stone properties of inkstones, but there are indeed not many insightful and experienced talks. Only the Duanxi Inkstone History written by Wu Shihua of Jiaying in the Daoguang years is the most accurate and can distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of the four caves of Shui Yan and the five layers of stone in each cave one by one. In the past, there were endless disputes about the advantages and disadvantages of the East and West caves, but later, Da Xi was highly praised. Wu Shihua's discussion is very correct. We believe that the necessary conditions for recognizing the stone of Da Xi Dong or Shui Gui Dong (the deepest part of Da Xi Dong) of Shui Yan are: (1) "Quality": dense texture, fine and smooth, warm and moist as jade, although extremely smooth, it can produce ink, release ink, and remove ink (washing it away without a trace is called removing ink).</p>
<p>(2) "Color": The stone on the north wall of Xia Yan before the Song Dynasty is deep purple like pig liver, moist like purple Lin Yu, and makes no sound when ground (this product is rare). The Shui Yan after the Ming Dynasty is mostly cyan-white and light purple like lamb liver, gentle and soft, like a new spring flowing.</p>
<p>(3) "Sound": When knocked, it sounds like wood. The ancients called it silent, but it is not really silent.</p>
<p>(4) "Beautiful patterns" such as cyan flowers, fish brain, sky blue, fire imprint, banana white, and oriole eyes, etc., must be bright and lively, and the red, white, and green colors must be particularly clear and vivid, like clouds and rosy clouds, with a pure, deep, delicate air. If these conditions are met, it must be a famous stone of Da Xi Dong. Shui Yan is in the water, so it is more moist and waxy. The ancients mystified it and called it "spring-born in stone, not stone-born in spring." Inkstone lovers regard it as a famous saying and supreme theory, but in fact, it is not reasonable.</p>

<p>When Ziqiang thought of this, he scratched his hair with one hand and beat the kang mat with the other, muttering to himself: Forget it, forget it, alas! Wang Shili was lying on the windowsill, filling out a form. Thinking that he had written it wrong, and that he was losing his temper there, he immediately stood up straight and asked: Isn't it written this way? Zhao Ziqiang suddenly heard him shout and realized what was happening. He stood up and asked: What are you talking about? I didn't realize you were in the room. Wang Shili said: Didn't the company commander just say forget it, forget it, was he greeting me? Zhao Ziqiang thought for a moment, shook his head and smiled: I didn't say you at all. I was thinking in my heart that these enemies are really hateful, flying their planes into our airspace as if it were no man's land. We don't have... Suddenly he laughed again and said: This time, we will definitely have planes coming, according to what I know, the number is still quite a lot. Wang Shili said: Since we have planes, why doesn't our air force launch? Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said: I'm just a small company commander, how can I answer you this question? If I were a commander-in-chief, I could answer you this question. Wang Shili said: I think maybe we don't launch the air force first in order to prevent the enemy from preparing, and when it is necessary to launch, we suddenly fly out all of them, two or three hundred planes, lining up in the sky and heading straight to the Northeast, bombing them unexpectedly. At that time, our army will also be more active. Company commander, do you think I guessed right or wrong? Ziqiang rubbed his chin with his hand and smiled slightly: Probably close enough, right? Wang Shili rubbed his hands together, shrugged his shoulders and smiled: If there is such a day, that would be fun. Ziqiang smiled: You do have a patriotic heart. Wang Shili stomped his foot and said: Company commander, don't mention it, I almost caused trouble because of patriotism. Once I went to the Dong'an Market, damn it, I met a large group of dwarfs.

Every considerable distance on the wall has a 30-foot-high watchtower, with complete telegraph and telephone equipment, and is in contact with the headquarters of the border guard. The purpose of this Great Wall is ostensibly to monitor contraband smuggled into Russia from abroad, but in reality, it is to prevent the Russian people from fleeing abroad. Therefore, if people are seen escaping outside the wall from the watchtowers, they can be shot from the towers.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Promulgation of Measures by the Ministry of Education for Subsidizing Diligent and Hardworking Students from the Northeast <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Northeast Youth Education Relief Office Sends Letters to All Schools Nationwide Requesting Applications for Subsidies from Students from the Northeast</p>
<p>(Nanjing Special Dispatch) The Northeast Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education has formulated the "Provisional Measures for Subsidizing Diligent and Hardworking Students from the Northeast." After submitting them to the Ministry of Education for approval, yesterday, it sent separate letters to all provinces, cities, bureaus, and colleges above the vocational level nationwide, requesting them to identify diligent and hardworking students from the Northeast as stipulated in the measures, fill out application forms, and apply to the office for subsidy fees. The original letter stated, "In order to expand educational opportunities and cultivate national salvation forces, the Ministry of Education has formulated twelve Provisional Measures for the Relief of Diligent and Hardworking Students from the Northeast (referring to students from Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin provinces and cities) who were forced or voluntarily entered the pass to seek education with diligence and ambition. These measures were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. In accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of these measures, the Northeast Youth Education Relief Office was established to handle various relief affairs. It was established in Shangjing on January 30 of this year and a resident office was established in Beiping on February 12 to be responsible for investigating diligent and hardworking students from the Northeast in the provinces and cities of North China. In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for the Relief of Diligent and Hardworking Students from the Northeast, relief matters are temporarily divided into four categories: '(A) The Ministry of Education continues to issue notices to all public and private schools at all levels nationwide, stipulating that diligent and hardworking students from the Northeast, who have been verified by the school, shall be exempt from tuition fees; (B) Subsidies shall be granted to those who are truly unable to afford meals, accommodation, books, etc., but have excellent academic performance; (C) Schools shall be established specifically for training students from the Northeast; (D) A quota shall be set for students from the Northeast studying abroad.' Except for A, C, and D, which have been handled separately, the granting of subsidies under category B has also been drafted by this office as Provisional Measures for Subsidizing Diligent and Hardworking Students from the Northeast and submitted to the Ministry of Education, which approved it under Order No. 1911. In addition to sending separate letters, we enclose a copy of the Provisional Measures for Subsidizing Diligent and Hardworking Students from the Northeast, as well as an application form, a guarantee letter, and a certificate, and send them to your 'Department,' 'Bureau,' 'School' for reference and distribution to your affiliated colleges and attached schools. Please thoroughly investigate the diligent and hardworking students from the Northeast who are currently studying. Those who meet the provisions of Article 1 of the Provisional Measures for Subsidizing Diligent and Hardworking Students from the Northeast should be instructed to fill out the application form, sign and seal it, attach a recent two-and-a-half-inch headshot, and obtain a guarantee letter from two individuals with considerable occupations or reliable credit. After verification by the college, fill out the official certificate and send it directly to this office (those closer to Nanjing, please send it to this office in Nanjing; those closer to Beiping, please send it to the resident office of this office on Dangbu Street, Beiping City) for verification and handling. This is for official communication."</p>

<p>China Must Establish Vocational Schools That Meet Needs</p>
<p>Efforts Should Be Made to Promote Elementary Education</p>
<p>Mr. Mowrer, Deputy Director of the International Labor Office, accompanied by Mr. Li Ximou, Commissioner of the Ministry of Education, and others, arrived at the Ministry of Education at around 4:00 p.m. on the 20th to discuss education issues. Minister of Education Wang Shijie invited Vice Ministers, Directors of various departments, Secretaries, Counselors, Section Chiefs, etc., to gather in one room. He first expressed his welcome and then exchanged views and reports on education issues. Mr. Mowrer said that although his stay in China has not been long, based on his observations, the most urgent need for education in China at present is to vigorously develop vocational education and to establish practical vocational schools that are not merely for show and that meet the needs. In order to promote the popularization of education, efforts should be made to promote elementary education. These were Mr. Mowrer's suggestions for China to pay attention to promoting vocational education and elementary education. He then asked about the Chinese education community's feelings regarding the recommendations on education in the report of the previous League of Nations inspection team. In addition to Vice Minister of Education Duan Xipeng reporting on the implementation of higher, secondary, and elementary education in the Ministry of Education in the past two years and the direction taken by Chinese education, he responded to Mr. Mowrer's inquiry about the recommendations in the report, saying that China has many similar plans to the League of Nations report and is currently carrying out these plans. Except for a small part that is difficult due to factual difficulties and national conditions in China and cannot be proportional, most of them are agreed with and accepted. As for the teaching of China to promote vocational education and elementary education, the Ministry of Education has plans and methods to promote them nationwide so as to gradually achieve expectations. It is also heard that Mr. Mowrer will still go to the Ministry of Education on the 22nd to discuss more specific education issues.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Explanation by the Ministry of Education on the Measures for Examining and Grading Student Performance in Primary and Secondary Schools <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on the inquiry from the Hebei Provincial Department of Education, asked whether the measures for examining and grading student academic performance in secondary schools and elementary schools during peacetime by educational administrative organs at all levels also included normal vocational schools. (The draft measures issued by the Ministry for secondary schools include middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. However, according to the provisions of Article 5 of the original measures, it seems to only refer to middle schools. Does this measure also apply to normal vocational schools?) It was instructed to explain, "The measures for examining and grading student academic performance in secondary schools and elementary schools during peacetime by educational administrative organs at all levels issued by this Ministry naturally include middle schools, elementary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. Article 5 of the original measures is specifically intended to supplement the measures for graduation examinations in middle schools, with special emphasis on middle schools and subjects that have not been examined and subjects with poor examination results. This provision does not exclude the peacetime examination of student academic performance in normal and vocational schools. Please be informed."</p>

<p>Dr. Pang Jingzhou, who was hired by the Ministry of Education, left Shanghai on the 5th of this month to inspect the state of medical education in North China in Jinan, Beiping, Baoding, Kaifeng, and other places. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his public duties and is resuming his regular medical practice. According to Mr. Pang, students in various places in North China are able to endure hardship, and the lives of teachers are also relatively stable, so the spirit of each school has special merits. However, the customs of the people are relatively closed, and patients who are hospitalized are generally perceived to be lacking, which poses a major difficulty for the clinical work of the medical school. As for his detailed report, it is currently being organized and will soon be submitted to the Ministry of Education.</p>

<p>Last night, they defeated Great Britain 34-27</p>
<p>The situation was tense and the performance was very exciting.</p>
<p>In the International Women's Basketball triangular finals, after China lost to the United States, last night they played the final match against Great Britain at the Chinese basketball court. The Chinese female players, mindful of their previous defeat to Great Britain, were extremely cautious and prepared last night. Sure enough, the lineup was refreshed. Relying on the wonderful passing coordination and Chen Rongming's excellent shooting, China defeated Great Britain 34-27, avenging their previous defeat and winning the Shanghai International Women's Basketball Championship. The scores of the two teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>China</p>

<p>Superb Skill　The situation in yesterday's battle was tense, the movements were swift, and the interest was very strong. The Chinese women were lively and exquisite, and their performance was superb. The forwards were sharp and extraordinary, seizing every opportunity. Chen Rongming's technique was skillful, and her eyes were focused. Several long shots were incredibly skillful, leaving the audience in awe. The guards suffered due to their short stature, and there were occasional risks. Fortunately, their ball skills were pure, and they took the initiative, preventing the opponent from shooting. In terms of passing and shooting, the Chinese team was above Great Britain. Moreover, their liveliness and fighting spirit, their elusive movements, were unmatched by their opponents. Great Britain relied solely on their tall physique, but their technique was slow and rigid, and not worth learning from. Only two or three hundred people watched, and the appeal did not seem to be great.</p>
<p>Key to Victory　The overall momentum was tense and extremely fierce. The Chinese team was well-balanced, but Chen Juming stood out from the crowd and was the hero of the victory. Great Britain's Parker Hill and Hugh Leighton were also very skilled. At the beginning, Great Britain showed its edge, but the Chinese team advanced step by step, slowly expanding their lead. They took the lead 8-7 in the first quarter. From the second quarter, the Chinese team's score increased significantly, but Great Britain eventually caught up, making it 18-16. The Chinese team only led by two points in the first half. The key to victory was entirely in the third quarter, where China scored a total of eleven points, while the opponent only scored three points. Even if Great Britain counterattacked in the end, they were still out of reach.</p>
<p>One Point Ahead　The United States took the lead with a surprise attack. The center jumped for the ball, and the guard received it, sending it to the basket. V. Poring and Parker Hill each scored a goal, surprising China. The defense was then strengthened. Yang Sen made one free throw, also scoring three points. V. Poring scored again, making the score 7-3. The British women were overjoyed. The Chinese team quickly caught up, and the forwards gradually coordinated. Chen Rongming refused to be outdone, making close and long-range shots, showing off her skills. In an instant, she scored five points in a row, exciting the audience and cheering them on. British player Parker injured her foot and left the field, replaced by Haymont. The first quarter ended with China winning by one point, 8-7.</p>
<p>Sometimes Strong, Sometimes Weak　Parker continued to play, and the Chinese team's edge was strong and unmatched. The forwards became more active, and the defense became more strict. After Chen Jucai scored first, Yang Sen and Chen Rongming successively made contributions, and the score increased greatly. They ran across the field, like hungry tigers. The British women were greatly threatened and frustrated for a long time. However, their determination to advance did not slacken. At 7-18, after a stalemate, the British team also followed closely, pressing hard. The situation suddenly changed, and B. Poring made a free throw, turning a spark into a prairie fire. Afterwards, Parker Hill and others scored four goals in a row, and the score changed to 18-16, with China only leading by two points.</p>
<p>Golden Age　In the second quarter, the biggest score difference was when China was ahead by eleven points. It was undoubtedly China's golden age. At the beginning of the second half, the United States scored first, making it 18-18. Chen Rongming made three shots in a row, which were wonderful and unmatched. She became more and more courageous in battle, and her arrogance was blazing. Chen and Yang scored successively, and the momentum was magnificent. This was China's golden age, 29-19, a difference of ten points. China's foundation was solid, and victory was already in sight.</p>
<p>Final Victory　In the last quarter, Great Britain counterattacked fiercely, but their shooting was inaccurate. After being monitored and occupied by China, they could not find a way to move, so they had few opportunities to shoot. The great opportunity was missed again and again. The Chinese line was quite chaotic, and the situation was not as good as before. Both sides scored alternately, but the performance was dull and tasteless. Great Britain's fierce counterattack made China feel scared. In the last quarter, Great Britain won by three points, 8-5. In the final result, China won 34-27.</p>

<p>— Moteng</p>
<p>Most modern youths who are excessively refined and bookish are useless because when it comes to doing things, they can only verbally instruct others. For example, if a robber breaks into the house, they cannot "capture the thief themselves," so they must let the robbers loot the house!</p>
<p>To capture the thief yourself requires skill because thieves are not easy to catch. Even Tai Chi requires skill. There is a great difference between foolishness and wisdom, which is not easy to discern.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the Great Way is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness; when poetry dies, then the Spring and Autumn Annals are written; when hermits arise, then the Buddhist dharma declines; when humor arises, then right and wrong die. The reason for this is out of necessity. Everyone feels bored, buzzing and grumbling, and there is no way out. So, what to do? Change the broth.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw seems to have described a layer of hell—very different from what Yan Liben painted—where there are no evil ghosts or yakshas, and the ghosts are like floating smoke. There is an age problem there. Pretending to be a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl is no longer fashionable. It is better to change into a fashionable outfit. Then, the age is over thirty! It is considered more modern. In short, you have to change the look, break the mediocrity and monotony of the atmosphere. It is like a goldfish in a glass tank, unable to swim out of the surrounding transparent substance, so let's swing the tail a few times in there, so be it!</p>
<p>The "romanticism" and "elegance" of some officials are mostly cultivated and forced out in this way. They won't eat vegetables unless they are made by a certain chef, and they must use certain materials to make clothes. When spring comes, they must visit the plum blossoms, and when autumn is deep, they must appreciate the chrysanthemums. This can relieve boredom and resentment, and the risk is relatively small. In a severe drought, fish moisten each other with saliva, but if there is no saliva left, then they will probably all dry up and become dried fish.</p>
<p>Alas! Things have no permanence. Words are forgotten as soon as they are spoken. After being full, one becomes hungry again. Yesterday you captured the thief yourself, and today you have to capture the thief again. Thieves cannot be caught completely, like morphine needles, which must be injected again and again. This is called having no way out. "Oh, my beloved compatriots"! Listen to the "Hang Oh" and wooden fish sounds from the wall!</p>
<h3 id="e204">Spring and Women <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Mengzhen</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Spring has arrived, in the gorgeous new clothes of women, in the touching eyebrows of women. "Spring feelings penetrate the crisp chest, spring colors cross the eyebrows." It is spring that has come to the world.</p>
<p>Only I am still wearing a broken cotton robe, which the spring breeze cannot reach. But seeing the dazzling spring light and the spring colors all over the street, the heart of a withered winter also can't help but throb a little.</p>
<p>I walked to a department store and saw the gorgeously dressed, flowery female clerks standing among the colorful goods. She is a kind of moving advertisement.</p>
<p>I strolled through the streets and saw groups of three or five girls on the road, slender figures, brightly colored cheongsams; a woven waist, a semi-circular arm shadow, swaying and swimming, just like the five-colored fish in Yuquan.</p>
<p>In the past, women were only objects of sexual desire, reproductive machines, but now they are more of a work of art for people to admire. Works of art are precious and easily damaged, so I see on women's bodies, strips of paper written by etiquette and morality, warning people in general:</p>
<p>"Look with your eyes, don't touch with your hands!"</p>
<p>Hands off!</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Speaking of works of art, women are not historical rarities like antiques, but fashionable works of art like the recent expressionist and cubist art. On the bodies of women, there is a full meaning of time.</p>
<p>When spring comes, women are the expression of spring in nature, a symbol of spring.</p>
<p>Because they are so full of temporality, the Twin Sister brand of cosmetics, like the beauty trademarks in cigarettes, used to be popular for a lifetime, and were the so-called standards of beauty, but now they have become antiques, outdated things.</p>
<p>For this reason, Confucius said: "Only women and petty people are difficult to raise." This means that modern men and women are easily outdated. A woman's youth is at most only ten years—from fifteen to twenty-five—after this time, "green leaves become shade and the branches are full of children," it is no longer a sunny spring scene where miscellaneous flowers grow and many orioles fly.</p>
<p>Lu Tong's daughter's song says: "Orioles and flowers are blooming, but you don't come, and when you come, the flowers are old," so the late beauty is the most sad thing in life. For this reason, women in general can indeed seize the spring light and are not willing to let this flowery age pass by. Isn't that right? The spring cold is still harsh, spring is just coming, men still have more cotton clothes, and women are all fluttering in single cheongsams. Women can indeed catch up and get the first of the trend. In this respect; women are thoroughly and thoroughly pioneers, they come to the world with spring. Moreover, just as spring symbolizes the germination of all things, women are the producers of mankind.</p>
<h3 id="e205">My Purpose (Continued) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiahua</p>
<p>(8) Gambling Den—I changed it in Xiaoshan, at that time it was when the Japanese imperialists were ravaging Shanghai. Although this is a prose-style thing, I also added about 3,000 words. This manuscript was sent to Modern, but the editor thought that the material was neither like prose nor like a novel, so it was returned; it was later published in Youth World.</p>
<p>The other three articles were changed relatively little, so I will not list them one by one. Under this kind of fact, Zhuanpeng一口咬定 that I "took" his article without his permission, I really don't know what his intention is. In fact, after he already knew the news of Wen Lie, he even asked me to take an article to Liangyou in the afternoon, saying that he needed money to use right away, and asked me if it was okay to sign my name for convenience. I didn't agree at the time. I now understand what his "knowing and doing it" means.</p>
<p>But no matter what, my past casualness about creation is an unforgivable mistake. Although I spent a lot of effort to revise it, so that Zhuanpeng's article completely changed its old appearance, I don't want to argue strongly and try to cover up the sins of the three of us like last time. In addition to Zhuanpeng's article, I also revised two novels by Mr. Chen Fuxi and took one by Mr. Lou Zhiming, which I also frankly admit. Moreover, just like Zhuanpeng pointed out my mistakes, I also hope that he can sincerely correct his behavior that is similar to mine: (1) The Naked Woman Under the Sun, written by Lawrence, originally translated by Mr. Zhou Guangxi, published in the Nanjing Central Daily News; (2) The University Prince, published in the Hangzhou Republic Daily, was written by Chuan Shangao; (3) He asked Peng Chenghui for two volumes of Wen Zichuan's essays, saying that he would send them to Central Park for publication; (4) He also asked Chen Fuxi and Lou Zhiming for novels, which he would not explain in his confession. I am not holding a grudge to report him, but using this fact to illustrate that this ugliness is not my personal problem, but the traditional vanity—the writer's desire—that forms this fact. This vanity made me try to deny this matter at the beginning, which resulted in that article "About My Creation."</p>
<p>But the facts tell me that this kind of cover-up can only be effective when the interests are the same, otherwise it will explode sooner or later. Therefore, I deeply realize that the exposure of this ugliness, superficially speaking, damages my personality and reputation, but in fact, even if I maintain this false personality and honor, it is only harming myself. I am young, I should have self-confidence, so now I am very frank to admit my mistakes. That is to say, this kind of vanity of a writer is just a poison in my life, and I am willing to give myself an injection to clear the poison. But here, I have to solemnly declare that I do not necessarily give up creation. However, my future creative attitude will be serious and faithful. I will never sing that empty tune of "creating for the sake of creation" again, but I want to seek the way of expression from the social significance. I feel empty and small about my present and past self, but I will never be discouraged because of this. I should be vigilant and obtain the practical meaning of creation from life. I hope that I can be silent for a while, if possible.</p>
<p>As for the threats from Yang Cunren and others, I will absolutely not feel terrified, even though they said in the letter to Mr. Chen Fuxi:</p>
<p>"This matter involves Xu Jun, He Jun, and Mr. three people. To be honest, if it is made public, it will be unfavorable to all three of you, especially He Jun..."</p>
<p>Dai Hengjun openly protected Zhuanpeng, saying that he "has another explanation"; such a clever statement, although very beautiful, still cannot hide from the eyes and ears of discerning readers.</p>
<p>In short, I have recognized the significance of this fact from the root of the social system, so I frankly admit that my article "About My Creation" is not frank, and I am exposing my own mistakes to the readers, hoping to get a fair criticism. As for those threats and malicious attacks, I don't have so much free time to pay attention to them.</p>
<p>This is my statement.</p>

<p>— Lu Yan</p>
<p>"Damn it!" He seemed about to reach out his fist. "Are you taking it to beg for food! You even want to steal a bowl..." He walked back and forth, grinding his teeth.</p>
<p>He is really a true northerner.</p>
<p>The car finally moved forward. After passing through a few high arch-like iron frames, it stopped in a ship. Walking down to see it, it was not very big. There were a total of four rows, which could only hold twelve carriages. The locomotive put down the four carriages in front of us, then went back to drag four more, and finally dragged the remaining two. When we arrived on the other side, we did this three times. We arrived in Nanjing at 7:45 and did not leave Pukou until 11:00. I thought it was too slow. According to the previous method, I believe that in this time, we can travel back and forth from Nanjing to Pukou two or three times. This great ferry gave us physical comfort, without having to go up and down, but at the same time it gave us spiritual anxiety, making us wait anxiously. It also reduced the carrying fees of our luggage a little, but at the same time it also reduced the income of those coolies.</p>
<p>Now I have been brought to the north of the Yangtze River. Looking out from the car window, I can only see yellow soil and wheat.</p>

<p>— Heartfelt Words</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the dew is heavy,</p>
<p>Wetting my purse and handkerchief.</p>
<p>Wet handkerchief is no matter;</p>
<p>But wetting the purse, ah,</p>
<p>Wastes my sister's money and worries her heart!</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The sun sets behind the mountain ridge,</p>
<p>The spring water behind the ridge is cold and clear;</p>
<p>I advise you, sister, don't drink the cold spring water,</p>
<p>Cold spring water chills the conscience,</p>
<p>Leading to a marriage without offspring!</p>
<p>Miao. I don't know if it's psychological, or a real fact, but I always feel there are no interesting country views. I remember last summer, sitting in a car to Suzhou, the slightly yellow rice and the bright green bean leaves rolled like wheels under my eyes, how interesting it was!</p>
<p>3. On the Longhai Road</p>
<p>Arriving in Xuzhou, I missed several old friends here. It's been more than a decade since I set foot on this land. How did these ten years pass? Like a dream. Where is the youthful banquet? Some have died, and some have disappeared. At least I wanted to take a look at this long-lost homeland. But the night was dark, there was nothing, just a few dim lights, like ghosts.</p>
<p>The passengers in the car now have completely changed their appearance. Their skin is all rough and old, not one of them looks young. Gray or black clothes, reflecting bronze complexions. Men and women, all tightly wrapped their trouser legs. Occasionally, the pungent smell of garlic wafted through the carriage. Although these many people came from different places, their clothes and luggage were almost all domestic products, with no trace of foreign style or southern elegance. I felt like I was seeing the real Chinese people.</p>
<p>The ticket inspectors came to bother us at every stop, I don't know what it means. I had just fallen asleep, and I was woken up. Just now a five- or six-year-old child didn't buy a ticket, but now a three- or four-year-old must buy a ticket.</p>
<p>"Four and a half years old requires a half-price ticket! That's the regulation!"</p>
<p>So the passenger had nothing to say but to take out the money.</p>
<p>"He has no way of knowing how old you really are!" A soldier who followed the ticket inspector said, after they finished checking the tickets, they came again after a small station. Now it was the turn of a village woman who had just gotten on. She was with a three- or four-year-old child. She refused to pay for the ticket, she said that she had taken this car a month ago, and she brought this child, and she didn't buy a half-price ticket either. But she said the child was four years old.</p>
<p>"If you're four years old, you have to buy a half-price ticket, say one more time, how old are you!" The ticket inspector was obviously particularly polite to her, hoping she would deny what she just said and change four years old to three years old.</p>
<p>But she didn't understand, she didn't understand the benefits of lying, she still answered that she was four years old. So she had to pay for a half-price ticket.</p>
<p>She is really foolish. In the south, there are too many smart people. Isn't this kind of problem something even a child knows how to deal with?</p>
<p>At dawn, the locomotive spewed white foam, like clouds, winding on the ground. It covered the desolate sandy plains, conjuring up beautiful landscapes in front of our eyes. I had walked this road ten years ago, but that was in the summer, the carriage windows were open, and all that came in was gray sand and dry heat. Now there are more and more trees on both sides, but unfortunately, they are all still bare. If it were spring, with the car windows closed, blocking the flying dust, and advancing in the green woods, I'm afraid you couldn't find such a beautiful journey anywhere else in China. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e209">Last Testament (3) <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>It has been almost four months since Yina and Yijie left; at the time of leaving, she only felt a sense of abandonment, but now she is indeed under the pressure of life.</p>
<p>When Yijie had just left, she thought men were so ruthless, men who wanted to play everything, but in fact, before she could play a man, she was bound by a law. She thought that the reason why Yijie could leave her so easily was that there was no official status between her and him. She wanted a status first, if she were to be with any man again. If that law wasn't there, she could have cohabited with Yechu long ago. She felt she loved him, but she could never let go of his wife in his hometown.</p>
<p>And now what she feels most urgent is not how to get, or how to get a man, but how to solve the problem of her and her family's livelihood. If any acquaintance knew that what she needed to solve was such a problem, it would be laughable or unbelievable, this, she knew, but to herself, it was indeed a fact that could not be relaxed slightly, so she felt doubly sad. And the only key to why she didn't write much before but now always wants to write as long as someone asks her to write is the urgent need for稿費.</p>
<p>For the same reason, she agreed to write a novella for Xi Zhuoyun's Literary Bi-Weekly.</p>
<p>From the next day, that is, from Monday, Yina indeed began her "Taste of Life". She had warned her mother in advance to answer all phone calls to her saying "she is not at home," and locked herself in her small room day and night.</p>
<p>After about two weeks like this, "Taste of Life" was completed, with more than one hundred and forty manuscript papers. Completed, Yina was very happy and lighthearted. Because she thought that according to the pre-arranged four yuan per thousand words publication fee, she could get more than two hundred yuan, which could barely get her through the year. If she could sell the copyright at the same time, she could still be comfortable for a few days at the end of the year and the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Although it is said that the end of the year is the beginning of the year, in fact, the new year had already passed at that time. The day she finished the manuscript was January 20, but it was the sixth day of the twelfth lunar month. - Yes, the end of the year she was talking about was the lunar new year, and only the lunar new year seemed to become a hurdle. Usually, she doesn't pay much attention to the lunar calendar, but as the end of the lunar year approaches, she almost completely forgets the solar calendar, she only remembers the lunar calendar. Especially this year, before the time had even entered December, she was worried about how to get through her new year. Therefore, now that she has finished writing her "Taste of Life", her joy and lightness are obviously not without reason.</p>
<p>The manuscript was finished in the evening, and the next day, the seventh day of the lunar month, was Sunday, and Xi Zhuoyun did not go to his office, and she was unwilling to go to his house, so she decided to postpone the submission of the manuscript to Monday.</p>
<p>And on Sunday, she invited one or two acquaintances, and had a good time playing for a day, to stretch her spirit and body that had been suppressed for two weeks.</p>

<p>—Central Bank Opens Current Account, Breaking $70 Mark—</p>
<p>The gold market was exceptionally strong yesterday due to the sudden shrinkage of silver prices, US banking leaders indicating no hope for silver legislation, and breaking through the $70 mark. In the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and US fell in unison, with forward silver prices on the gold and silver exchange falling by 3.5 to 4.5 percent. Exchange rates fell slightly, London gold fell by two pence, US cotton fell by fourteen points, US wheat fell by 0.25, and stocks also fell by $1.65. The wool market opened and immediately rose to $64, but then due to a cable from the Associated Press stating that leaders of US banking groups had secretly reached an agreement with the President, indicating that there could be no further discussion of silver legislation in this session of Congress, and that the Fessinger-Vela and other cases were hopeless, the market rose even further. After opening, banks pooled together and rose, and later Reuters reported that a former US Treasury Secretary had strongly argued for the restoration of the international gold standard, and Professor Whalen also had a theory to restore the old monetary system, but at the same time, foreign telegrams stated that US banking group members would convene as early as April 2, without waiting for Rogers to return to the country. The gold market was extremely calm, hovering around $6. The Central Bank opened current accounts, and the situation remained stable, as did the exchange rate market. The underlying trend continued to rise. Later, the domestic banking market was unusually tight, and a telegram from Bombay reported a decline of ten annas. Public confidence was soaring, and the $70 mark was finally broken. March futures trading continued to rise, breaking through the $720 mark, one yuan higher than the closing price. Red gold was priced at $979, and boiled red gold was slightly weaker due to the influx of eastern goods. The swap discount was around one yuan. The Central Bank opened more than 300 current accounts at a price of $967, and it was heard that a small number were opened later at a price of $969.50. A record of today's market situation is provided below:</p>

<h3 id="e213">Specified Interbank Loan Rate Difficult to Implement Temporarily <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The previous trial implementation of the prescribed foreign interbank loan rate, with a minimum of 5 points, unexpectedly resulted in an oversupply and a large disparity between supply and demand among the same industry in the morning, making it difficult to maintain the 5-point price. It was found that yesterday's check positions were as high as 1-2 million, and no one cared, so it was necessary to reduce the market price in order to sell off. As a result, the previous agreement was overturned, and the white loan market was reopened at 2 points. Therefore, the guild was in such a situation that it was difficult to force it, so it settled down and watched the movements. For the most part, there are still market prices of white loans and 2-3-4 points temporarily. If restrictions can be imposed in the future, it is necessary to wait for the opportunity to mature before determining the course of action.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Securities and Bond Markets Rise for Six Consecutive Days <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>1921 Customs Bonds Nearing 80%</p>
<p>Excessive Rise Requires Guarding Against Reversal</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rise in the Chinese Securities Exchange became more and more intense. The situation on the trading floor was extremely tense, and market prices soared, creating a "golden age" for government bond prices in spring. General psychology regarded it as a strange phenomenon. Since Friday of last week, after new high prices were discovered, this had been the sixth day, and no new high price had been discovered on any day. Observing the situation silently, at first there might be a small rebound, followed by a slight retreat at one point, but the rebound would inevitably exceed the retreat, and eventually the rise would become more and more vigorous, and new high prices would abound. Yesterday's situation, from beginning to end, every sector and every item was rising, and the rise was particularly strong after the afternoon opening. In such a high-price market situation, a sudden rise of half a yuan in one sector was almost crazy. Both the Unified Salt Tax Bureau had broken through 65%, 1921 Customs was nearing 80%, and 2021 both were nearing 70%. Since the September 18th Incident, such high prices had not been seen. Although it was due to the squeeze, there was no shortage of new bulls. The abnormal development to this point may come to an end, and a slight rebound is also expected, because sellers on the trading floor, such as numbers 38, 53, and 79, were selling very aggressively, and the northern gang was also actively selling, so the closing salt tax short was slightly tired. The number of bulls inside and outside the market was relatively high, and retail short covering was gradually satisfied, so it is necessary to guard against a reversal. As a result, market prices continued to rise by 2-3 cents to one yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 18-19 million, which was omitted due to the late closing. A comparison table of the resulting increases is shown below: (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e216">Serious Labor Strikes Cause New York Stock Market to Fall <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>According to a Wall Street Journal report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm, yesterday's New York stock market saw a sharp drop in various stocks, ranging from several corners to six dollars. This was because the labor strike situation remained severe, and traders were deeply concerned that although the government intended to stop the auto industry strike, it might be unable to do so. Therefore, many sold off their holdings. Later, due to the strength of Canadian securities, the market stabilized at closing. Many traders are adopting a wait-and-see approach, awaiting the development of the exchange management case. The small exchange market was mixed, with prices fluctuating unpredictably. Bonds and U.S. government bonds were mixed and slightly lower. Also, a report from our New York agent stated that (securities) are facing unrest due to labor strike issues, but the market lacks pressure. (Wheat) trading is almost at a standstill, with no positive news; the harvest is not prosperous, the southwest is still experiencing drought, and farmers continue to appeal for relief. (Cotton) has very few new transactions due to the chaotic situation, and bulls continue to sell off. There is slight unease regarding the labor strikes, and the spot market is quiet with a tendency to loosen. The Punkhead Act will be transferred to the Senate for discussion. According to the common opinion of brokers, it is only advisable to buy when prices fall, and traders should be cautious before the situation clears up. The Dow Jones New York index is recorded below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 101.01 99.33 Down 1.68</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 46.94 47.94 Down 1.00</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks 26.12 25.71 Down 0.41</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 92.77 92.58 Down 0.19</p>
<p>Eleven Commodities 53.96 53.29 Down 0.67</p>
<h3 id="e217">Old Standard Yarn Suffers the Worst Decline in Yarn and Flower Market <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Selling Pressure</p>
<p>Bulls Unable to Sustain Support Alone</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is sharp. This situation is entirely due to the adverse environment. Therefore, even though a certain factory is trying its best to maintain prices, the slightest bit of bad news causes sellers to rush in like a tidal wave, making it impossible for bulls to hold up the market alone. At the same time, rumors in the market suggest that the factory's opinions are still divided, and there are ample delivery chips, with more than 8,000 bales already delivered to warehouses. In this situation, sellers are particularly keen, and with U.S. cotton prices falling, the decline in old standards is becoming increasingly severe.</p>
<p>This Month's Futures Down 3.4 Yuan.  The previous market opening for standard yarn saw a sharp decline in old standards due to the weakness of U.S. cotton and the lack of major buyers in the market, falling from 1.9 to 2.6 yuan. Distant months fell by 6, 7, and 8 corners. In the afternoon, selling pressure remained strong, with each month falling by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 corners. Total transactions for the day were 48,900 bales. Sales included 1,750 bales of Mingde, 900 bales of Dafeng, 1,550 bales of Suilong, 1,000 bales of Yuanda, 850 bales of Yuande, 1,800 bales of Renfeng, and 1,700 bales of Changfeng. Purchases included 1,400 bales of Fuda, 1,000 bales of Jinchang, 5,050 bales of Gengfeng, 1,050 bales of Xiesheng, 1,250 bales of Tonghe, 650 bales of Tongxing, and 700 bales of Hengchang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>
<p>March 178.0 176.1 176.1 Down 3.40 30,650</p>

<p>The cotton market, which had been hovering for days, suddenly weakened. Although the U.S. cotton's Pinhade reduction plan has been passed, market prices have failed to rise. Meanwhile, the severe labor strike there has led to falling market prices, giving sellers a boost and intensifying the downward trend. At the same time, news of a sudden influx of more than 8,000 dan of goods into warehouses has further unnerved the market, causing the price of standard cotton for all months to break through the 42 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Breaks the 2 Yuan Mark  The previous market opening for standard cotton saw strong selling pressure due to falling U.S. cotton prices and unfavorable news from Indian cotton, with each month falling by 4.6 corners. In the afternoon, each month fell by 1.5 to 2.3 corners. Total transactions for the day were 160,100 dan. Sales included 8,900 dan of Chunji, 2,400 dan of Yukang, 5,200 dan of Gengfeng, 13,000 dan of Changfeng, 2,900 dan of Yongda, 3,800 dan of Xinhua, and 7,600 dan of Deji. Purchases included 4,500 dan of Dafu, 4,400 dan of Suilong, 3,900 dan of Huikang, 3,800 dan of Shenchang, 2,400 dan of Yuande, 2,700 dan of Yicheng, 3,500 dan of Dachang, 5,500 dan of Xincheng, 6,400 dan of Changhe, 2,500 dan of Shenji, and 2,100 dan of Yifeng.

<p>Increase of 2,811 Bales</p>
<p>According to a survey by a foreign firm in this port, the total number of Japanese factory yarn shipped from Shanghai to various regions in February was 23,249 bales, an increase of 2,811 bales compared to the previous month. The reason for this increase is said to be the launch of spring sales in Tianjin, North China, and brisk sales in India. However, sales in Incheon and this port have decreased significantly. The volume of shipments to various regions is recorded below (unit: bales):</p>
<p>Incheon 450 Decrease 1,230 India 3,945 Increase 1,065</p>

<p>—Market Prices Show Significant Improvement—</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, market conditions for all months turned favorable. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, continued to decrease by about one corner, while Canada had no market. When the morning market opened, it was rumored that the Yingkou gang had spot flour transactions, which stirred up long-dormant sentiment. Factory chips for this month were mostly automatically withdrawn, and the factory did not intend to release most of the chips, so people were fearless and rushed to buy, and the market became brisk. When the afternoon market opened, due to excessive speculative buying and price increases, speculative customers were no longer active, and the market was once again shaken step by step. It is said that this situation is due to an agreement among factories not to release new chips, which is closely related to the previous government wheat situation. Therefore, bulls disregarded the environment and arbitrarily raised prices. Judging from this situation, there must be significant internal discrepancies. As a result, this month's prices surged by 3.25 cents, May prices rose by 4 cents, June prices rose by 4.25 cents, and July and August prices rose by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e222">This Month's Wheat Futures See a Rise Due to Short Squeeze <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the morning and afternoon openings, the market conditions for all months showed a sharp increase in near-term prices and flat or soft conditions for distant-term prices. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, decreased by about one corner, while Canada remained unchanged. However, the opening price for this month in the morning saw a sharp increase, as bulls, said to be factories, intended to squeeze the shorts. Therefore, the opening price was gradually raised to 4.25 or 6 cents. In the afternoon, the market did not open. Distant months, being new goods, remained soft, but overall trading was brisk without special changes. As a result, this month's prices increased by 8 cents, August prices increased by a small 2 cents, and there were no other significant changes. The spot wheat market is trending stable and brisk, slightly better by 2 to 3 cents. Wuhe wheat opened at 3.57 yuan, substandard at 5.5 yuan, Tongzhou wheat at 3.58 yuan, and Yingzhou wheat at 3.54 yuan, totaling 4,000 bales, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Asking for Bread Instead of Cruisers <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>The global economic panic is deepening, the number of unemployed is increasing, and the social situation in various countries is becoming increasingly unstable. The ruling class in general is well aware that this is an extremely dangerous situation. However, the world's nations have long been developing in a distorted way. This development is always contradictory, and there is still no way to reconcile it. On the one hand, they witness hundreds of thousands of workers in their own countries who have no food or clothing, sinking deeper into misery, without thinking of saving them. On the other hand, they take the large sums of money squeezed from the people and use them to manufacture deadly weapons. They seem to think that in order to solve the unemployment problem, it is necessary to maintain the power of capitalism first. Therefore, they use all the country's wealth to build warships and create airships, while telling those who have no means of making a living to go hungry for the time being. Can warships and airships really reverse the misfortune of the depression? Everyone knows that the production organizations of modern capitalist countries already have many defects. The biggest of these defects is that the means of production are entirely in the hands of a few people. Therefore, even if military force can truly promote the expansion of capitalism, its profits will only be monopolized by a few special classes, and it will still have no impact on the lives of the masses. Recently, unemployed workers in London, England, saw through this point and organized a hunger march to petition the government, saying: "We ask for bread, not cruisers!"</p>
<p>Indeed, only bread can solve the hunger of the unemployed, and cruisers can only increase their pain. Bread can feed people, but cruisers kill people. Yet, which country in the world today is not robbing the bread from the mouths of the hungry and frantically rushing to build cruisers?</p>
<h3 id="e246">Cotton Cheongsam <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Boer</p>
<p>"Sir, are you very cold?" One morning, it was still a deep autumn morning, when I was still teaching at a school, I wore a newly sewn cotton cheongsam to school to teach, and one of the students asked me this. I told her yes, and added an explanation that I was wearing it so early because I was not feeling well. The elementary school student didn't understand after all, and two days later when she saw me still wearing the cheongsam, she asked me again with concern, "Sir, is your illness still not cured?" The weather, against people's wishes, insisted on not blowing a cold wind those few days, causing people to pay attention to my cotton cheongsam all day long, and I couldn't help but answer, "Yes, the illness is still not cured!" Pitifully, a pure good intention, received my cold sentence, and still glaring at her with her eyes, scaring her to death, and walking away without daring to say a second word.</p>
<p>When I returned home in the evening, the room faced north, and I thought about taking off the cheongsam and putting on a single one, but it seemed very cold. After thinking for a while, I still unbuttoned it, sat on the bed, and covered my bare feet with a blanket. I thought this would at least prevent the back of the cheongsam from getting a lot of wrinkles. Every day I took care of it like this, but in the eyes of others, it was already very old and dirty.</p>
<p>Regardless of how old and dirty it was, it was after all my only cotton cheongsam. Apart from it, I couldn't find two summer gauze cheongsams to use as autumn lined cheongsams. Before sewing it, I had also considered it for a long time, wanting to sew it into a lined one, but I was afraid that after wearing it for a short time, the weather would turn cold again, and then I wouldn't be able to find money to make a second one; if it was cotton, I wouldn't have to worry when it was severely cold, although I would be ridiculed for a while at present, so my cotton cheongsam was sewn on a certain day four months ago.</p>
<p>Recalling the night before Christmas, a friend insisted on dragging me to dance, I was very happy, but when I thought of myself wearing a half-old cotton cheongsam, and imagined the ladies and wives in the dance hall, either exposing their arms or exposing their chests and backs, but I was wearing a thick cotton cheongsam, wouldn't that attract attention and secret laughter? Old friends were too enthusiastic, no matter how much I declined, the result was that she arranged me to sit well on the left side of the dance hall, the music motivated my excitement, several times I also squeezed into the crowd and slid back and forth on the floor, sliding so much that a lot of sweat flowed out, and later I ran into many acquaintances, who all happily came to ask me to dance for a while. After a few hours, it became very difficult for me to endure. It was really too hot, the sweat was flowing as if I had been basking in the hot sun for half a day. I was really afraid that a bad smell would emanate from my body, the smell of those ladies was fragrant, but me, ah, I dare not say it.</p>
<p>This time, I really regretted the plan to make a cotton cheongsam at the time. There was no way but to leave the heavily heated dance hall earlier. Walking out to the side of the road, the cold wind blew on my face again, and at this time I thought again, after all, a cotton cheongsam is better! It's a pity that I've worn it too dark, and my brother also said that the top of my collar has black oil stains and it's very unsightly, so I made up my mind to send it to the laundry, and they gave me a list of washing fees for eight corners. Three days later, I was standing outside the glass window in an outdated single garment, watching it being washed very well and clipped among many other people's clothes. I thought it was my only cotton cheongsam, and I hoped that I could take it back next week and it would still belong to me.</p>
<p>However, the spring chill is still piercing, how difficult will it be to endure next week!</p>
<p>I love my cotton cheongsam, it is always my treasure.</p>
<h3 id="e247">"The Person Contemplating Suicide" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>"Hey, friend, where are you going? This bus turns back at the New World amusement park."</p>
<p>"To the Bund... Alas—"</p>
<p>"It doesn't go to the Bund. Get off at the New World."</p>
<p>"Alas—it's over!"</p>
<p>Inside a packed Route One bus, in a corner at the back, sat a middle-aged man in a Western suit. His head was tilted back, his eyes rolled upwards, and he sighed, muttering "It's over!" The other passengers stared at him with surprised looks, and the ticket seller, noticing, squeezed through the crowd to question him in the Shanghainese dialect. When the bus reached the New World, the ticket seller insisted he get off, saying, "The bus is turning back to the depot." He ignored them, continuing to sigh, shake his head, bite his lip, and wipe his eyes with a square black handkerchief.</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for at the Bund?" the young, impatient ticket seller asked like a judge.</p>
<p>"Going to the XXX pier on the Bund," the answer was heavy, mumbled, and unclear.</p>
<p>"What?... Pier?..."</p>
<p>"Alas! What pier is it to you! Who has the mind to argue with you? Alas!" This time the sigh was sharp, and his voice trembled slightly.</p>
<p>"A suicidal person!" the passengers whispered, convinced of his strange behavior.</p>
<p>The bus stopped at the Bund station. I nodded to my companion and followed the strange man out of the bus and into the crowd. He staggered south, oblivious to the oncoming cars, seemingly rushing towards the river. Intrigued by his odd behavior, and worried he might actually be suicidal, I rushed forward and grabbed his arm.</p>
<p>"Hey, why are you running towards the river like you're trying to die?" I asked, breathless.</p>
<p>"..." He looked at me, his eyes showing gratitude for my concern.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to kill yourself?" I asked again, loudly.</p>
<p>"No... Why do you people say such awful things, asking someone if they want to kill themselves?"</p>
<p>"Then why are you running to the river? Friend, I have some free time today. Let's talk." I took his arm and walked west along Avenue Edward VII. I learned that he was from Taiyuan, Shanxi, studied mechanical engineering in France for five years, returned to China in 1932, and was now a French secretary for the Kunming municipal government in Yunnan. He was heading home because his beloved wife had died, and his father had wired him to return for the funeral.</p>
<p>"Have you been to Shanghai before? Do you have any companions? Where are you staying?"</p>
<p>"I'm alone. This is my first time in Shanghai... Alas..."</p>
<p>"If you have something troubling you, we are all brothers. Tell me, and we can think of a solution together. Have you had dinner yet?"</p>
<p>"Alas! I'm penniless and at my wit's end. I've been in Shanghai for two days and only had one bowl of noodles. I only have forty cents left. What dinner can I have! I've slept with ghosts for two nights! Alas..."</p>
<p>"Friend, let me treat you to dinner. Can you translate French? I can recommend you for a job!"</p>
<p>"Alas, why are you so annoying, dragging me along? Let me go. I have things to do. I don't need your help." He broke free of my grip and turned to walk east again. I had intended to help him find work, but he was blaming me. I was annoyed, but I was also beginning to suspect him. I grabbed his arm again and walked west, then north, then west, then north again, and then west again. On the way, I asked him about some friends who had recently returned from studying in France. When I mentioned their names, he always repeated them, saying they sounded familiar, but he couldn't recall their situations. Later, I asked him about a Mr. Zhu who had studied mechanical engineering in France at the same time as him and had recently become mentally ill due to unemployment. He replied that there was no such person who studied mechanical engineering in France.</p>
<p>"Hey, you have nothing better to do, but don't delay me. Are you dragging me along to kidnap me? Let go!" As we walked calmly towards a tall red-walled building, he struggled desperately to break free, pulling backwards. I said gently, "Why? Friend, China needs talent! Mechanical engineers will have their day... Let's go eat dinner..."</p>
<p>"Don't joke around. If you're treating me to dinner, why are you dragging me here? Why didn't we eat at the restaurant we just passed?" Ah, we had already walked onto the quietest part of the Fourth Avenue. Wasn't the building ahead the police station? Oh, the police station. His earlier "Don't joke around... why are we coming here?..." rang clearly in my mind. I realized everything. I thought clearly, "Let's test him." I said sternly,</p>
<p>"Look, I'm a detective from the police station. Come with me to the station for a while." I showed him the badge on my inner shirt but quickly put my shirt back down.</p>
<p>"Friend, why are we joking with each other? Let's go our separate ways." He angrily shook off my hand and strode south.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Women's Professions <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>The topic of women's professions can be said to be an important issue in society today. However, the author is not female, and is not particularly close to women. Furthermore, the issue is too complex to be fully examined in a short piece. Therefore, I only intend to contribute some personal observations on certain aspects of the issue.</p>
<p>Everything has a cause. The cause of the women's profession issue can be traced back to the history of women's liberation. Traditionally, women were confined to the home, with no place outside it. Their lives were too restricted, so they sought liberation. The initial stage of this liberation was women seeking education. If we recall the past few years, most educated female compatriots were fighting for the opportunity to study. Later, this issue was resolved due to the momentum of the times, although not without some setbacks. However, education is only a prelude to liberation. In other words, education only provides some knowledge and technical skills. With knowledge and skills, there is a natural desire to use them. Furthermore, the entire issue of women's liberation cannot be considered complete with mere education. Therefore, the issue of women's professions is the second step in women's liberation, and the most important issue today.</p>
<p>The tide of the times is fierce. Every breaking wave has many victims. This is a reality we are told. The women's profession issue is like such a wave, currently unfolding. Thus, when we open the daily newspapers, we see many reports of victims in this tide. At the same time, in this economically depressed society, finding a career for women seems exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, when studying this issue, we must consider women's safety. Some may say that this is a problem of the entire social organization and must be addressed through social reform. I think that might not be entirely true. In my opinion, women themselves must solve it. My contribution is this: unmarried women should fully prepare themselves with various practical skills and knowledge. When they find a partner, they can help their husbands in their work. For example, if the husband is a doctor, then the wife can be his assistant or a nurse. If the husband is a merchant, then the wife can do accounting. For married women, it is even easier. They only need to do what they can within their husband's field of work. In this way, women will face fewer inconveniences and dangers outside of work. Furthermore, husbands will be more motivated in their careers with a loyal and reliable assistant. At the same time, many obstacles in the women's profession issue can be avoided.</p>
<p>Some may say that my proposal still implies that "women are appendages to men." This statement seems reasonable on the surface, but in reality, it is a non-issue. Because in today's society, except for a very small minority, whether men or women working outside the home, are afraid of not being oppressed? Rather than being someone else's appendage, it is better to be one's husband's appendage. Furthermore, when women work under their husbands, they are nominally helping their husbands, but in reality, they are cooperating with each other. On the other hand, they also monitor each other's actions. As a result, they can certainly trust and be happy with each other. At the same time, it can be said to be the true essence of gender equality; the goal of women's liberation!</p>
<p>However, I wrote this article specifically for women in intellectual circles. I will include this as a postscript to conclude this article!</p>

<p>— Meng</p>
<p>Ding Yuanwai of Dingjia Village, Huzhou, relied on his power and wealth. He privately created a fish tax, forcing fishermen to pay him—he would sit and collect a lot of money, and would not allow any to be owed. This drawing shows fishermen respectfully paying the fish tax.</p>

<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>It was early spring weather, the chill was gone from the air, containing a gentle breeze, blowing on people's bodies, refreshing.</p>
<p>Ah, how precious, this spring evening's undulation.</p>
<p>Carrying pent-up depression, treading on the magnificent Nanjing Road, BulckFordDonge... glossy and smooth, rolling by, like a gust of wind, passed the outbuilding.</p>
<p>"Let's sit for a while, huh?" "Let's go!"</p>
<p>Outside the window of the Wing On Company building, such a sentence flew out, an oriole's voice, the sound waves, so harmonious and delicate!</p>
<p>Stepping on the stone steps of the Da Dong Restaurant, my heart fluttered!</p>
<p>"They won't kick me out, will they? Maybe, they will question me in detail—like treating me as a thief?" I pondered, unable to restrain myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the busy them, did not seem to notice me. So, quietly, along the thick felt, I stepped upstairs, the sound was very low.</p>
<p>Bright electric lights, suspended at a passageway entrance, under the lights stood many people wearing neat white shirts, very dignified. Their eyes were fixed on me, as if searching for something, at this, I trembled, almost losing the courage to move forward.</p>
<p>Thank heaven, I finally escaped that difficult pass, although it went through a degree of interrogation.</p>
<p>Entering the hall, what flashed before my eyes were: white tablecloths, white chair covers, countless heads, bodies of varying heights, red silk draperies, yellow gold characters... all this, teasing me, I felt as if countless sparks were jumping around in front of me.</p>
<p>Finally, I was also placed on a white upholstered chair. After a considerable period of time, I felt that the eyes of these people were not as sharp as those outside the passageway, at this, the previous courage slowly recovered.</p>
<p>The roof, snow-white, in each square compartment, milky light bulbs were emitting milky light, one by one, dissolving on people's faces, revealing the vitality of spring.</p>
<p>At the southern end, on the platform with the double happiness characters made of red neon tubes, the halo, red, soaked the fresh flowers, look, she was smiling.</p>
<p>Hair fragrance, powder fragrance, skin fragrance, all kinds of fragrant mist were broadcast by fashionable female guests, blowing on the hearts of young people, blowing on the nostrils of old people; fawn, ochre, coffee, dark black... different colors, covering different graceful figures.</p>
<p>Melon seeds, being peeled in everyone's mouth, the shells were casually spit on the ground, cigarettes, being smoked at will, the smoke lightly lingering in the room: bananas, the peels peeled off, "thump"! The tip with the black spot, was spat by delicate red lips onto a clean plate.</p>
<p>The dishes, were being changed, one by one, the wine, in large copper pots, poured into small silver pots, then sent into people's stomachs. After the bride and groom revealed smiles and "toured to toast", a scene of chaos! Gradually thinned and quieted down.</p>
<p>Leaving the door of Da Dong, the wind, blowing in my face, gentle, blowing on people's bodies, the chill was gone from the air, it was early spring weather.</p>
<p>Ah! How precious, this spring evening's undulation.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Rain (4) <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>The rain beat vigorously on the roof, showing no signs of stopping. Yuan Wen glanced at the window, misted over with water vapor, and said to himself,</p>
<p>"I should go back..."</p>
<p>"So early."</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the tea server poked his head in and asked, "Mr. Zhu, are you eating dinner?" Before I could answer, Sister Wen interjected, "Then I'll go back! Do you have an umbrella to borrow?"</p>
<p>As she asked the tea server about an umbrella, I said to her, "Eat dinner first, or wait for the rain to stop. It's not convenient walking alone in the rain. You can't get a taxi at this time."</p>
<p>"Then you can take me!" she said directly and cheerfully.</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>"You don't have to," she said, smiling.</p>
<p>I nodded and said, "I'll take you." I turned around and told the tea server that I wouldn't be eating, and asked them to eat first.</p>
<p>Stepping outside, I saw endless rain. The lights on Ge Ling were vaguely visible, flickering uncertainly in the rain. The two of us shared an umbrella and walked slowly along the Su Causeway, not speaking. The sound of our footsteps, mixed with the sound of the rain, created a unique scene. I had been in Hangzhou for almost half a year and often liked to wander around on my own. I thought I had seen all the scenic spots in Hangzhou, but the West Lake after the rain had a different kind of beauty. This thought flashed through my mind, and I wanted to send her back to school early so I could enjoy the rain alone, so I quickened my pace.</p>
<p>"Walk slower." Her right arm bumped the hand holding the umbrella. "Are you afraid of ghosts on the way back?" She laughed uncontrollably. The umbrella tilted in the wind, splashing her face with rain.</p>
<p>After walking the length of the Su Causeway, we turned left, and we were at her school. She knocked on the door and said to me, "My colleagues at school are good to me, but I can't get along with them. I often force myself to agree with them, which is too boring. Come talk to me when you have time. It's been more than two years since we last met."</p>
<p>I nodded casually, and hurried back. As soon as I stepped onto the Su Causeway, two people rushed ahead from behind. They had no rain gear, and they were soaked. The shorter one carried a basket containing several bowls of food, which could no longer be distinguished as fish or meat, as well as incense burners and candle holders for offerings. The taller one was panting. He looked like he had lost his balance while running, swaying from side to side. The shorter one said, "Mom, be careful!" Only then did I realize that they were a mother and son returning from sweeping the tombs.</p>
<p>Filled with the anticipation of enjoying the rain, I saw them mother and son, and suddenly changed my mind. Pointlessly going, and my cousin would resent me for being too cold, what have the peach blossoms changed in the corner of the school gate, and at the same time thinking the colleagues thought I was a mysterious guest? And then without thinking, I began reciting the phrase "During the Qingming festival, the rain falls in torrents, travelers on the road are dejected!" (End)</p>

<h3 id="e255">Black Drama Masterpiece "The Emperor Jones" Now Made into Film <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>Black people seem to be given us special recognition in our money-worshipping cities, especially in trendy dance halls. Every night, performance programs often include black people dancing, black people doing comedy, and black people performing acrobatic stunts. It seems that besides entertaining people, black people don't have to do anything else.</p>
<p>We know that several famous works of American literature are about the lives of black people. The most famous author is Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose book "Uncle Tom's Cabin," translated by Lin Qin Nan in our country, was made into a film called "Black Slave's Soul" by Universal Pictures. A few years ago, the famous director King Vidor made a black religious film called "Hallelujah," which was also a masterpiece that caused a sensation in the film industry.</p>
<p>The black drama "The Emperor Jones" by Eugene O'Neill, translated by Hong Shen and Gu Zhongyi, was made into a film by United Artists last year and will be shown in the local area soon. The film's translation has been changed to "The Fall of the Overlord." The original play is a one-act drama divided into eight scenes. The stage performance begins with the character Jones as the emperor of a small island. At this time, his final days are approaching. The islanders are rebelling, and the remaining seven scenes describe Jones frantically running for his life in the forest. The film "The Emperor Jones" recounts the facts before Jones became emperor, which seems to be more detailed than the stage play. The second half of the film, which depicts Jones as emperor, is very similar to the stage play.</p>
<p>Previous O'Neill dramas made into films include "Anna Christie" starring Greta Garbo (translated as "Blue Water Love") and "Strange Interlude" starring Norma Shearer (translated as "Red Powder Drifting"). When the stage play "Strange Interlude" was performed in New York, it opened at 2 pm and did not end until 11 pm. In between, there were meal and rest times for the audience. This could be considered a strange interlude. The play "The Emperor Jones" has had three different performances: the first is the stage play, with the famous actor Charles Gilpin playing Jones; the second is the opera, with the singing star Lawrence Tibbett, who once made a splash on the silver screen with Lu Fanli in "Eternal Regret", playing Jones; and the third is the film drama.</p>
<p>Paul Robeson, the actor who plays the main character in the film "The Emperor Jones", is more famous than Charles Gilpin in the stage play and Lawrence Tibbett in the opera. This is because Robeson has played Jones in all three different performances of "The Emperor Jones" – stage, opera, and film. Robeson is originally black, so his portrayal of Jones is even more realistic and thorough. Robeson graduated from Columbia University Law School in the United States, but he did not become a lawyer and instead became an actor. He also has a natural singing voice that is well-suited for opera. His first stage appearance was in O'Neill's "All God's Chillun Got Wings," followed by "The Emperor Jones." A few years ago, Robeson performed the song and dance of "The Emperor Jones" in London, which was greatly welcomed by the King and Queen of England.</p>
<p>Because Robeson is a black person, but he is also a scholar, and the British do not discriminate against black people like the Americans do, so in England, writers H.G. Wells, Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, former Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and the Prince of Wales all treated him as a guest. Because Robeson was treated so generously by the British, he did not want to return to the United States. But United Artists hired him to star in the film "The Emperor Jones," so after the film was made, he went to England to live permanently.</p>

<h3 id="e256">Review of "People Behind the Scenes" <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>—Central—</p>
<p>When we review Chinese literary works, there are many excellent creations that show that the Chinese literary scene has indeed achieved encouraging results. But at the same time, there are indeed too many shoddy things. This is not only due to generally empty and shallow content, but also to the extremely backwardness in creative skills. Naturally, this is a very terrible phenomenon.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is even more so in the field of film. On the one hand, there are relatively excellent works such as "Life" and "The Wrath of the China Sea," and on the other hand, there are films like "People Behind the Scenes." Hasn't "Sister Flowers" been showing for more than thirty days and trying to break "Eskimo's" world box office record? Although the film itself does have many unsatisfactory aspects, it has already greatly surprised European and American film merchants. However, our filmmakers should consider how to further promote this glory? This is something the creators of "People Behind the Scenes" should pay attention to.</p>
<p>"People Behind the Scenes" is a product of Yue Ming Company. We will not forget the same company's "Bad Neighbors," although that was also a childish thing, it was much better than "People Behind the Scenes."</p>
<p>In any case, "People Behind the Scenes" is a work below the baseline. The reason is to desperately cater to the audience's low-level interests, so regardless, love, martial arts, detective, ethics, all kinds of things are forced together in an ugly way.</p>
<p>Some people say that we should be more lenient towards the productions of small companies, and we cannot use the same standards as large companies. Whether this statement is appropriate, I do not want to say more here, but, like the boring stuff of "People Behind the Scenes," if we do not also give it strict criticism, isn't that intentionally ruining the future of Chinese cinema?</p>
<p>I hope that the creators of "People Behind the Scenes" will no longer treat film as child's play, and will humbly put in a lot of hard work in research, otherwise I am afraid that they will be abandoned by the progressive audience forever.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Review of "Lucky Girl" <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Highland</p>
<p>“MaidHappy”—Guanglu Lanxin—</p>
<p>When a film's author is creating it, if for the sake of convenience in their script, they freely develop the story, and in terms of screenwriting, directing, etc., they only seek simplicity and speed, using fragmented images from real life to complete their story, without considering whether this fragmented image is appropriate or realistic in the play or scene, it is easy for the playwright, but in terms of the value of the work, it becomes a big problem.</p>
<p>All great works of art are nothing more than a true expression of life. Lacking authenticity, there is no artistic value. The creative attitude towards artistic works needs to be serious. The reason why great works of art are produced is arduous work, and it is for this reason.</p>
<p>In "Lucky Girl", the author uses fragmented images from life to complete their story, without considering the authenticity of life.</p>
<p>The most important thing, for example: a young and handsome diplomat gives a top-secret diplomatic card to a young girl, forming the center of this drama. Many characters are active around this event. In real life, we find it difficult to see this kind of fact. It can be said that it is</p>
<h3 id="e258">The Beginning of Love Fire—Gao Zhanfei and Tan Ying's Expressions in Lianhua's Epic Film "Wind", Directed by Wu Cun <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>extremely exceptional. There are many coincidences in the rest of the plot. Many important keys and turning points are very fictional. What we see is not life, but a fake play, just to have these opportunities for the actors to meet, talk, sing, pile up some facts, and end with a final kiss.</p>
<p>Britain is an old empire. The development of all industries and cultures was very early. They maintained the lives of their upper class by exploiting colonies and domestic farmers and workers. Therefore, what the upper class needed was only light-hearted humor and leisurely music to satisfy their feelings after exploitation. They are unwilling to touch real life, and even if they do, they distort it. It is also reasonable that it is difficult for valuable works to appear in British films (of course, other films are rarely exceptions).</p>
<p>It is difficult for a director to unfold his skills in such a story, and Mansfieldmarkbam, in addition to putting considerable effort into the musical effects, is as clumsy as the screenwriter in other aspects.</p>
<p>Charlotteand and JohannesRiemann did not have enough room to develop their skills in such a story. Charlotteander's performance skills are not as good as J. Riemann. In addition, the old male and female professors and the swindlers can express the unique character of that kind of person, and they get some fragmented effects from their characters, which of course are laughable effects. The background is in Switzerland, and the scenery seen on the scene, the life in the night garden, these places can be regarded as fulfilling the task of "introducing the scenery". If it is purely to introduce the scenery of Switzerland, as a documentary film, the meaning may be better.</p>

<p>— Sumei</p>
<p>In that large hall, in the stillness of the night, suddenly a black shadow was moving. The bright moonlight of winter shone in through the window, reflecting on the floor and walls, transforming into terrifying black and white shadows. The black shadow moved step by step, step by step, and soon passed the guard post and disappeared into Catherine's bedroom.</p>
<p>"Be careful," Captain Woronov bent down and told the queen sleeping in bed. "Everything is ready, Your Majesty, please hurry." Catherine climbed out of bed. She was wearing a guard's uniform, and said in her mouth, "I'm ready... why did I wait so impatiently that I fell asleep." As she spoke, she followed Woronov out of the bedroom and ran into the large hall. A guard came to challenge her, but Woronov was quick and tied him up in one fell swoop. In this way, they quickly left the palace. Catherine ran to the barracks. The soldiers recognized her as the queen and immediately swore to sacrifice their lives for her and annihilate her enemies. Everyone shouted slogans: "Long live Catherine! Death to the Tsar!" In this way, they set off in formation, with Catherine leading the way on a white horse. At the same time, in the church, all the priests were also holding a meeting. When Catherine arrived, they all unanimously supported her as the head of the church. The priests all ran to kiss her hands and feet. A priest asked, "Can we ring the bell? All of Russia is waiting for this bell." Catherine went to ring the big bell herself without saying a word.</p>
<p>Peter was in the palace, and when he heard the bell, he jumped up. He left the bedroom and walked into the corridor, where he saw his guard tied up and lying on the ground. He shouted, "Why is the bell ringing? What does this mean?" A person in the black shadow replied, "Peter, you will naturally understand soon." Captain Woronov walked out freely. As soon as Peter saw him, he shouted, "Do you still want your head? Don't you know I'm the emperor?" Woronov said, "The emperor is gone. Now there is only the queen." After he finished speaking, he pulled a napkin out of his mouth. Peter knew that something was wrong, and while shouting for help, he wanted to escape into the bedroom, but Woronov took a step forward, and something was already around his neck. He immediately knelt down, a wave of darkness in front of him, and he had lost consciousness. Woronov ran to Peter's bedroom and saw that Elizabeth was pale with fright and trembling. Woronov said, "Are you still not running away? Are you still waiting for the queen's soldiers to come and tear you to pieces?" As he spoke, he came out.</p>
<p>That day was the day of Catherine's coronation ceremony. It is known that the coronation ceremony was held in the auditorium. The priests chanted praises. A high priest sang: "Our sorrows have come to an end, our happiness is about to begin... Your sincere love for Russia has spread far and wide, so all the people of Russia deeply hope that you will ascend the throne early, remove their shackles, and abolish all previous dangerous policies... Now God and his angels will remain with us forever... May your enemies tremble in the dust... Few of those who wear this crown have been glorious monarchs, but may you further enhance its splendor and fame." After speaking, he placed the brilliant crown on Catherine's head. The priests and ministers all ran forward to kiss her hand. The haggard and pale Alexey was also mixed in with the crowd, shrinking back and daring not to step forward. Catherine saw it and smiled to herself, "Who can predict the things of the world?" (End)</p>
