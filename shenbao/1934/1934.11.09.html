<h3 id="c32">美國民主黨總選勝利 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>據最近美電。美國此次國會改選。主黨仍獲勝利。按美國衆院每二年改選一次。參院每二年改選三分之一。今民主黨於參衆二院。既能保持其絶大之多數。則羅斯福一年半來所行之新政。當能邁步前進。而不致横受阻梗也。</p>
<p>民主黨此次之勝利。自為美國多數人民信任羅氏新政之表示。世人對於美國之復興運動。每多悲觀之論調。而事實上之表現。亦未予我人以可以樂觀之憑證。如本年入夏以來。工潮迭起。情狀極為不安。可知羅氏之復興運動。雖推行甚力。結果則殊不見佳也。</p>
<p>然今次總選。何以美國人民對於民主黨仍予擁護。是亦不難加以説明者也。簡言之。即羅氏能使美國一九三三年初之空前金融恐慌。迅速中止。不可謂非一大成功。蓋美國一九三三年初之金融恐慌。為一九二九年後世界不景氣之結果。亦為美國産業畸形發展必至之境域。美國於大戰以前。雖已為近代工業之國家。然其工業生産之突飛猛進。實受歐洲大戰之賜。在此大戰期間。不獨歐洲各國之生産事業。幾於全部停頓。即軍需之補充。亦皆仰給於美。昔日局促於本國市塲之美國工業。至是乃雄飛於世界。其擴充發展之速。實為前此各國所未有。唯美人當時所獲之財富。大抵屬於記賬性質。而並未有多大之實利。故一至大戰告終。美人所得者。乃一筆鉅大之戰債。及龐大過當之工業設備而已。唯此後八九年間。（一）以歐洲各國戰後之復興。尚須仰賴美國物質上之援助。（二）以美國尚能維持其對外之貿易。（三）以歐洲各國尚未有賴債之行動。故美國經濟恐慌之條件。雖已具備。其人民則尚沈醉於虚僞的繁榮之中而不自覺。唯至一九二九年後。因各國關税壁壘之增高。對外貿易之衰落。此種經濟弱點。逐漸暴露。延至一九三三年初。遂成絶大之經濟恐慌。銀行之倒閉者。達數千家。各種證劵股票之價值。亦莫不大跌特跌。言其損失。共達百分之九○。戰時以世界唯一豪富見稱之美國。猶且發生偌大之恐慌。則今日欲使美國恢復戰後數年間之繁榮。其難可知。我人若以此種眼光。觀察羅氏之復興運動。庶不致有吹毛求疵之嫌。</p>
<p>美國金融恐慌之大爆發。猶在羅氏就職之前。然彼一就職後。即能力挽狂瀾。不能不令人敬佩其措置之有方。綜觀羅氏之復興計劃。其可得而言者。約有五端。（一）為貶低幣值。（二）為救濟失業。（三）為管理工業。（四）為救濟農業。（五）為擴大放欵。言其主旨。（一）在使債務人易於償債。抑止破産之風。（二）在提高物價。繁榮市面。（三）在增加人民之購買力。（四）在改善勞動者之待遇。（五）在限制個人主義之企業行為。觀此數端。羅氏政策固以多數人之福利為依歸也。</p>
<p>最近一年半以來。復興運動雖尚無甚大之成績。然亦不乏差强人意之處。如就物價一般言。至今年九月底止。約漲百分之二八。就原料言。約漲百分之四三。就農産言。約漲六四。若與戰前比較。無論農工産品。皆已超過戰前之水準。至於生産方面。除重工業外。凡屬日常必要用品。頗多增至一九二三年—五年之水準。而農人今年度之收入。亦較去年前年增加不少。故就大體論。羅氏之復興計劃。不能不謂其有相當之成功。由是以觀。今次民主黨之重行勝利。自非偶然矣。世人頗有以羅氏獨裁為詬病者。殊不知羅氏得國會之擁護。而為有條件的有期限的獨裁。此與希特勒墨索里尼輩之獨裁。逈不相同。且此種獨裁。主旨在於為國家建非常之功。故有利而無弊。再則羅氏對於復興計劃。最近又曾有逐步改善之表示。是其今後之施政。固非一成不變者。有此數因。故民主黨之重獲勝利。宜也。</p>

<p>英國疏通未易奏功</p>
<p>［倫敦］美日代表對於英國所提岀打破海軍談話僵局之方案、均不作響應、故前途殊形黯淡、該方案昨已通告日代表團、建議英美日應發一共同宣言、在原則上承認日本於安全上之平等權、另每國應自動發表片面宣言、聲明其關於海軍防務之需要、以代束縛的條約限制、日本專家今日表示對技術各點之不滿、日代表團雖未封閉對英國方案續作考慮之門户、但已表示其不能同意、美方對英國方案亦不欲作友好之表示、美代表雖主張締結堅固之恊定或條約、而願保留華府海軍公約、與維持五五三比率、惟須俟研究詳則後、始有正式之反響、外交部克萊可今晨曾謁見美總代表台維斯、解釋英國之方案、互談一小時半之久、美方現覺談話在目前之階段中、應全由英日代表互相接洽、俟獲妥恊後、美代表再以較大範圍參加之、一般輿情以為美日兩國皆堅持其原有立塲、英國疏通之努力當然失敗、蓋在日人觀之、既不饜滿其平等要求之志願、而在美人觀之、亦覺讓步過甚也、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英日代表團今日午後復正式舉行海軍談話、日本之提案終未因此稍有更改、故衆料談判必歸失敗、今英美日三國代表交換意見之唯一希望特點、厥為三方面皆願恊力防止海軍軍備競争而已、日本之平等要求、迄今未為英美代表團所接受、衆料將來談判之破裂、必因此暗礁所致、今日英日代表會議乃在下院首相麥唐納辦公室舉行、歷一小時半之久、雙方均無切實之建議、僅討論日本之提案而已、至英代表曾提議應許日本逐漸達到平等地位一節、已由當局切實否認、據日方消息、今日會議並未提及逐步平等問題、或原則上之平等、而附以目下不即事平等之約言問題、下次會議、大約仍將為英日代表全體之正式會議、惟日期未定、目前階段中之談話、乃求使英美日三國代表得相融洽、談話之機密性質、現未宣露、據現勢觀之、美代表覺妥恊難望成功、蓋英美均主維海軍比率、而日本則堅求平等、且欲採行總噸位制也、美代表尤覺海軍談話不特不能獲得妥恊、且將毫無結果而散塲、（七日路透社電）</p>

<p>根本方針不容退讓</p>
<p>［東京］英國麥唐納首相於日英會談曾提岀妥恊案、其内容為名目上承認日本之軍備平等權、惟以日英美三國締結紳士恊約、自制的得舉軍縮之實為前提、兹綜合海軍當局對此消息之意見如下、</p>
<p>雖於名目上承認平等原則、但若不包含實質、則等於無意義、至該提案之自制軍縮、將如何表示數字方式、現雖不明、但結果該方式僅欲將現行之比率主義、於實際上延長之耳、麥唐納首相於名目上顧全日本顔面、實則為圖保英美兩國優越地位之一策、然日本所得考慮者、始終以撤廢差等比率與確立軍縮平等權為根本、（八日電通電）</p>
<p>［東京］關於英國提岀之妥恊方案、海軍省雖尚未接到公電、但海軍當局抱有左列之見解、</p>

<p>（二）對於海軍力之限制方式、日本亦不固執己見、一俟檢討美國對策之内容、倘與日本主義相符合、則當適宜善處之、</p>
<p>（三）何為攻擊兵力、何為防禦兵力、其區别係歷年來之問題、即日内瓦之普通軍縮會議、早經議論紛紜、莫衷一是、當不能簡單訂定、英國之提案倘經明瞭、則日本亦須準備加以深刻之檢討也云云、（八日日聯電）</p>

<p>［巴黎］今晨國務會議開會時、急進社會黨四閣員、（不管部閣員赫禮歐、教育部長白爾都、商船部長裴德朗、農業部長葛意）向杜邁格總理正式提岀辭職、至十一點三十分、急進社會黨辭職四閣員退席後、杜邁格總理即與其同僚、起草内閣辭職書、於是政黨休戰内閣、遂遭顛覆、至急進社會黨各閣員致杜邁格總理函内、首先稱頌杜邁格之政績、次謂總理所提岀之憲政改革案、其性質逾越政黨休戰契約之範圍、彼等為忠於主義、並約束起見、不得不提岀辭職云、國務會議閉會時發岀公報、内稱急進社會黨各閣員對於臨時預算案意見不能一致、提岀辭職、故内閣乃提岀總辭職云、</p>
<p>按杜邁格内閣成立於本年二月九日、其時達拉第内閣因巴黎發生流血暴動、致遭顛覆、勒蒲侖乃授命前大總統杜邁格、聯合極端左派以外之各黨組織政黨休戰内閣、九閲月來、杜邁格内閣整頓財政、改革税收、節减政費、澄淸司法、預算賴以平衡、政局漸見穩定、最近杜邁格總理欲求澈底整頓内政、提高行政權力、乃主張改革憲政、憲政改革案有四要點、一則謀提高憲法中所忽略之行政權力、二則遇政府與兩院發生衝突時、如衆議院選岀已滿一年、但經大總統與國務總理同意、即可不經參議院核准而解散之、三則使立法權人員之服務保障、如公務人員有違抗政府行動時、得加以免職處分、此項憲政改革案、經朗特城急進社會黨大會加以討論、通過决議案、雖表示贊成提高行政權力、然對於不經參議院同意、解散國會一節、則加以反對、惟大會對於急進黨閣員、則仍予以自由表示態度之權、因此國會於昨日重開後、杜邁格總理本可即行提岀憲政改革案、惟修改憲法須經參衆兩院合併而成之憲法會議、加以討論、憲法修改後、解散國會重行改選、更需相當時日、明年度預算轉瞬即届、勢難久延、故杜邁格總理擬在國會提岀明年一二三月份之臨時預算案、請求通過後、乃續議憲法改革案、然急進社會黨各閣員、則遵守朗特城大會之决議、反對憲政改革案、因此對於提岀臨時預算案一節亦不能同意、雙方意見既相鑿枘、急進黨四閣員遂於今晨提岀辭職、至是杜邁格總理組織少數内閣、固屬不可能、且杜邁格昨日業已聲明、請求參院同意、解散國會、為彼所不欲為、蓋不然、則輿論將責彼為意欲獨裁也、因此杜邁格總理、乃决定本日午後不再岀席衆院、内閣遂向勒蒲侖總統提岀總辭職云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於避免閣潮各項努力、現均失敗、杜邁格總理亦已决定下野、目下最要之問題即「政黨休戰」之維持、既為大部分報紙所要求、而庶政整理又須繼續進行、則以何人負此重任、最為適宜、此蓋一般人所亟欲知悉者也、埃克西有報之言曰、「外國現方注視吾人、不可令其感覺吾人在内政上有參商之意見、蓋乘吾人内訌、以蹈嫌抵隙者、固不乏人也、為今之計、宜而沉着態度昭示國外、斯乃國人及各個人最高之義務、」晨報載稱、「由今晚起、即宜再組一政黨休戰舉國一致之新内閣、庶幾國外之窺伺者、得以辨别法國真面目、被欲利用吾國之弱點者、亦均廢然而返、」云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>高低務求整齊　據談、我國建築最大之缺點、即為高度相差之懸殊、試以上海之建築而言、低者除少數平房之外、大半為二三層以至五六層不等、而高者則有十餘層以至二十餘層、高度相差之懸殊、可謂達於極點、故頗足為空中爆炸之目標、蓋因建築高度相差之懸殊、在空中頗易識别、何者為何而加以爆炸也、大地震後之東京、所有建築之高度、均屬相差無幾、前者東京舉行防空演習之時、發覺東京最大百貨商塲之房屋、高岀於其他之建築、乃即通知該商塲、拆去一層、以除爆炸之目標、此固政府之責任也、我國最近宫殿式之建築、恒塗以紅緑顯明之顔色、此亦頗足以為爆炸之目標、而背乎防空之條件也、</p>
<p>地下須有設備　最近世界各國新式之建築、頂層均為平坦之露台、以供空軍來製時撤佈巨網、堆積沙袋、而免除炸彈之爆炸、地下尤須有地窟之設備、以供萬一之時、儲藏重要之文件、及作為生命避難之所、及視我國之建築、均以美觀是尚、毫不切乎實用、深覺不寒而慄、此固建築家之責任、尚希注意及之云云、</p>

<h3 id="c165">轟動徐家匯三届中校聯運會開幕 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>觀衆達一萬五千人以上</p>
<p>昨四項决賽兩項破紀錄</p>
<p>今日下午一時繼續舉行</p>
<p>第三届中等學校運動會、昨在徐家匯交通大學舉行、參加田徑賽者二十七校、團體操三十七校、會操達二千七百餘人之夥、會塲雖僻處滬地西隅、但觀衆排暇往觀者、仍不减勞神父路時之盛、大會昨日下午一時開幕、由潘局長致開會詞、褚民誼特蒞會致詞、男女各組五十公尺、百公尺、及男子四百公尺預賽、昨已全部舉行、决賽計完成男甲鉅球、男乙跳高、女子甲乙跳遠等四項、男甲鉅球正風關宏達、女乙跳遠愛國容淑儉、吴淞朱燕青均破上届紀錄、男子高欄及千五百公尺預案、昨以不及舉行、移至今日舉行、兹分誌如情如次、</p>
<p>會場一瞥</p>
<p>全塲正門在高敦路、塲内由南洋模範中學及保衛團維持秩序、昨日天氣晴朗、各校運動員無不精神百倍、塲之南北東三側為各校席次、各式旗幟、隨風招展、光彩奪目、司令台設塲之東側、陳列各項奬品、琳琅滿目）美不勝收、臺之左右、懸對聯一副、為「衛國端賴青年、為時勢造英雄、功在三復」、「尚武以强華冑、厲精神而運動、氣壯萬民」、各校運動員服裝不一、式樣美觀、交大田徑塲尚大、惟四週餘地較少、致觀衆擁擠、秩序頗難維持、</p>
<p>開幕典禮</p>
<p>一時行開幕典禮、各校田徑賽員、依次排列台前跑道、由公安局軍樂隊前導、次為大會職員、再次為女校運動員、後為男校運動員、在軍樂悠揚聲中繞塲一週、重立台前、行禮如儀、首由主席潘公展致開會詞、並代吴市長致詞、繼由市黨部代表喻仲標、名譽指導褚民誼、黎照寰等相繼致詞、即奏樂禮畢、開始運動、由仲子通指導唱運動會歌、即由各校學生入塲會操、由邵汝幹發令、沈賢示範、</p>
<p>主席致詞　主席潘公展致開會詞略謂、今天第三届中校運動會開幕提倡運動之意義、不是為少數學生争奪錦極、乃是鼓厲全體學生能注意國家民族的危險、以鍜鍊身體為將來民族打好基礎、本届參加田徑賽有七十一校、運動員九○九人團體操三十餘校、三十七節、參加會操者三十五校二千七百人、參加表演三女體校有四校、運動員四十五人較往年增加、希望今後與年俱進、使體育普及到全校學生云、</p>
<p>褚氏致詞　褚民誼氏致詞、略謂今天本人很高興參加本市第三届中校聯運會、中國體育近年來已漸發達、各地都有運動會舉行、惟運動會之薏義、並非養成少數選手、是要使每個學生都能運動、並推廣至學校以外、都能注意體育、中學生是身體正當發達時期、如在中學生時代、不加以訓練、即使養成墮落習慣、故中校運動會之意義、更為重要、在此國難時期、各位尤應注意體育、智育德育都要從體育上發展起來、望各位加緊努力云、</p>
<p>昨日得分</p>
<p>男甲田徑</p>

<p>决賽素描</p>
<p>男甲鉛球　昨日田賽决賽項目中、以男子甲組推鉛球競争最烈、計參加者有三十五人之多、淘汰至江淸、舒昌格、王遐齡、關宏達、黄龍煥、黄啓後等六人、競争尤烈、結果正風大胖子關宏達、以十一公尺八四成績、獲得第一、破謝全和保持之十一公尺五一紀錄、復旦舒昌格十公尺八九五、光華江淸十公尺八四五、相差尚少、</p>
<p>男乙跳高　男子乙組跳高參加者僅十餘人、民立吴禪深一公尺四八獲第一、成績雖以差、但跳來姿勢美妙、倘加以練習、亦可造之才、第二復中宋五昌成績一公尺四四、第三滬東施三詠成績一公尺四一、第四洋涇劉德綿、成績一公尺三五、</p>
<p>女甲跳遠　是項女子甲組、錢行素陳白雪以外、向無繼起人才、復中吴梅仙又退藏於密、人材愈見寥落、本届尤見悽凉、蜀中無大將、廖化作先鋒、務本譚尚珍僅以三公尺九三之成績、即登大室、較張蘋先之四公尺三十遜色多矣、</p>
<p>女乙跳遠　女子跳遠、乙組第一愛國容淑儉、與吴淞朱燕春、身輕體軟、脚頭十分有力、兩人成績同為三公尺八一、至最後决名次時、容淑儉一跳得四公尺○五、超過甲組成績、朱燕春亦增至三公尺九十、惜不得為正式紀錄也、</p>
<p>預賽觀察</p>
<p>昨日預賽共得六項、但臨時因天時黑暗、未能逐一舉行、高欄及千五米均改在今舉行、百公尺男子甲組大夏李松年、第一組、起步即掃得鰲頭、復中朱頌聖衝刺力豐富、允為後起奇材、是項成為十一秒八、較光華董寅初所造成之十二秒二又見燦爛、其他如上中葉海葉海濤之十二秒、青青陳永福之十二秒一、均屬可觀之成績、男乙第五組、上中唐祥林以起步流亮、獲得十二秒四之良好紀錄、推翻舊帳十三秒、殊非易易、此公姿勢跑步均見老練、預料複决兩賽中、實有搶得位置之可能、大夏蔣振華、步大而速、第一組以十二秒五、穩獲首座、女中甲組百公尺、第一組為華東施藕卿、成績十五秒、與次組張惠英之十五秒二、均破以往之紀錄、女甲五十公尺預賽、成績不妙、共得四組、均徘徊於九秒之外、實縁務本名將蕭傑英、南洋新人黎珂玲等、均因事未能加入、致四組首座、全屬愛羣天下、亦可謂冷門獨岀也、</p>
<p>開幕典禮（右角會長潘公展致詞、左角名譽指導褚民誼致詞）</p>
<p>— （王開攝）</p>
<p>五十公尺　女子五十公尺成績、甲乙組及體校、均屬平平、除體校以東南陳再春得八秒五外、餘均超過九秒、較小學運動會不如、良以南商黎珂玲未能參加、缺少一員虎將、華東沈嫣曾參加蘇省運動會、成績八秒左右、此次以起步太遲、退居第四、致遭落選、良屬可惜、</p>
<p>百公尺　男甲百公尺大夏李松年、畢竟不凡、成績十一秒八、其次如私立上中葉海濤、育青中學陳永福、亦頗不弱、决賽中必得地位、乙組當以大夏蔡振華、成績最佳、女子甲組華東施藕卿、决賽冠軍絶無問題、乙組務本鄧囡仙不可小視、愛國張敏知須加倍小心、</p>
<p>四百公尺　昨日男子甲乙組四百公尺預賽、原為最精采之一幕、惜在春色蒼茫中舉行、觀衆已漸减少、甲組中開明陳明良、乙組中光華陳業興、成績最好、</p>
<p>團體表演</p>
<p>昨為大會第一日、各校團體操表演有十三節之多、其中以澄衷中學器械操、高櫈　羅漢、高蹺體操、角力等最為整齊活潑、純熟美觀、惟覺過於硬性、似不甚合於體育原理、敬業中學之我們平日的早操、動作一致、精神飽滿、想見平日練習之勤愛國體育師範科之器械操、參加人數不多、但各人操來均見熟練、其他如民立中學之啞鈴操、吴淞中學之機警游戲、新亞之團體操、城東之健身操、洋涇之燕青拳、亦頗活潑可喜博得掌聲不少、</p>
<h3 id="c166">女選士遊行 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— （朱順麟攝）</p>
<p>會場花絮</p>
<p>三千餘人參加會操　昨日為開幕第一日、大會特舉行會操、參加各校男女學生三千餘人、分行排列、秩序井然、由競賽部主任邵汝幹發令、動作整齊美觀、精神尤見飽滿、為大會最生色之一節、</p>
<p>秩序欠佳各校注意　昨日各項田徑春開始時、各校運動員、滿塲亂跑、雖經保衛團、童子軍盡力維持、未見有效、希望今日各校體育教員特别注意、勸導學生、勿再亂闖、免碍觀瞻、</p>
<p>名落孫山淚眼相看　女子甲組五十公尺預賽時、華東女中健將沈嫣、在槍聲起後、尚未起步、迨後急起直追、已不可及、卒至名落孫山、不禁抱頭大哭、可惜之至、</p>
<p>體育皇后拍戲缺席　南洋高商黎珂玲、原參加五十公尺、及百公尺兩項、成績頗佳、旋以隨聯華影片公司赴蘇拍戲、未及參加、南洋實力、不免受其影響、一般影迷同志、更大失所望、</p>
<p>關大胖子無獨有偶　昨日男甲鉛球冠軍、為正風中學之關宏達、關體格魁梧、體重當在二百五十磅以上、其肥胖與最近來滬表演之美國鉛球好手鄧氏相仿彿、昨關乃成為視綫及鏡頭之集中點、亦可謂無獨有偶矣、</p>
<h3 id="c167">起賽之前應先作小練習 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>以活動血脈與筋骨</p>
<p>昨日新冬初賽、天氣較冷、一般成績、未能岀色、以饜衆望、其所以减色之原因、選手在未曾起跑比賽之前、皆未作活動血派筋骨之練習、實為大病、不特徑賽如此、田賽亦何獨不然、於是在此初寒之天氣中、不能大展其身手、尚望今日岀塲之男女選手與指導注意之、在成績方面、不無徵助也、</p>

<p>— 梅雪</p>
<p>度那學校生活的我，當然没有持螫賞菊的餘暇，但是我們的國學教授，每逢作文，常常岀着關係於蟹的題目，他老人家把蟹字寫上黑板，已有了兩三次。唉！可憐！可憐！嘴裏没有吃蟹，眼睛裏看了這黑板上的蟹字，豈不要三尺垂涎？四五百字的文章還没有完篇，倒是淋淋漓漓的沾濕了半邊！這是什麽？這是作文時掛下的饞涎。</p>
<p>蟹雖没有到嘴，但是想到吴諺中説及這個蟹字的，倒也供給我不少的幽默材料。蟹的諺語，如「吃老蟹，」「蟹手，」「呌化子吃死蟹隻隻好的」「荷葉包蟹，越包越弗是，」這是嫖賭吃着的棒喝語。年青的男子失身於蕩婦，呌做「吃老蟹，」是喜嫖的害處。碰和的手術不精，每賭必輸，呌做「蟹手，」是賭的害處。貪吃無厭，不顧衛生，呌做「呌化子吃死蟹，隻隻好的，」是喜吃的害處。專圖外面光鮮。不免内容暴露，呌做「荷葉包蟹，越包越弗是，」是喜著的害處。</p>
<p>其他，徒勞無益，呌做「牛吃蟹，」手足無措，呌做「嘸脚蟹肚肚，」每况愈下，呌做「一蟹不如一蟹，」供人奔走，斗做「蝦兵蟹將，」凡是吴諺中説及這個蟹字的，大抵有貶無褒。惟有一句「小洞裏摸岀大蟹來，」却可以鼓勵我們這一輩青年學子。現在埋頭苦幹，所得的學問雖甚渺小，但只須專心致志，鍥而不舍，終有大成的一日。譬如我們是學工程的，將來對於工程上，果有一種偉大的供獻，這不是「小洞裏摸岀大蟹來」麽？想到這裏，我便不敢以口腹之欲，妨碍我的學業，紙上的流涎便漸漸地乾了</p>

<p>第十七章　盛京之宫院</p>
<p>這一天，我們雖説是已經到了奉天，然而經過了好幾日的長途跋涉之後，人已疲憊得不知所云了；大家都在希望趕快休息，無論這些盛京的宫院是何等的偉麗動人，也没有精神去細細察看了，至多只能像走馬看花似的約略瀏覧一回，便算對於這個新環境，已有相當的認識了。好在我們今天來了，又不打算明天就走，依太后未啓程前的預算，準備要在這裏駐蹕七天，有了七天工夫，也儘够充分的盤桓一番了。但須過了今夜，各人的精力全恢復了，明天就好大大的逛一下了！我是最歡喜逛的，簡直恨不得今天就逛，可是我們有職事的人，行動那裏能自由呢？所以也只能忍耐着，到明天再逛了。</p>
<p>可是單只在這些空空洞洞的大宫院裏隨便逛逛，但能認識他的表面有而已，我是决不能滿足的；我必須設法知道他的歷史，和一切與他關的人的歷史，那才是真正的有趣味了！不過這些歷史，知道的人必然很少，在我們這些隨駕東來的許多人裏面，也許祗有一兩個人能説得岀幾句；而這一兩個人—當然就是李蓮英和慶善—又是我所不便，或不願多與接近的脚色，就是勉强去問他們，也未必能給我怎樣詳盡的答復。我想我父親十九是很淸楚的，無奈他此刻偏又不在這裏。那末再去問誰呢？别管他，明天决意向太后試一試，如其恰巧撞在伊老人家快話的時候，結果一定會十分圓滿的！（一七○）</p>

<p>十六歳，真是人生的一個最重要的關頭，因為你走上光明之路；或墮入黑暗之淵，或竟跑進墳墓，都是差不多在這十六歳上洒開的脚步。</p>
<p>在十六歳前，也是從呱呱墮地以至十六歳，這一個時期，是嬉笑跳躍在慈愛的父母的懷抱裏；當然，食是飽的，衣是煖的，一切的一切，都是只有愉快，没有憂愁，没有受到甚麽打擊，因為憂愁或打擊，都給父母承當去了，然而，父母的懷抱，年齡將不容許你長是依纞在那裏，同時，生活的鞭子，也跟着你年齡逐漸準備起向你示威了，於是至多到了十六歳，千金之子，自然例外，你終於不得不離開你慈愛的父母的懷抱，而洒開你人生的第一步，走上你的生活的前途去。</p>
<p>為的是第一步呀，是你入世生活的第一步呀，那一種重要性，你就萬萬不能忽視，何况，眼前的這個世界，正是光明和黑暗還没有分岀勝負的在激戰着，同時還有許多牛怪蛇神之類，在亂動，在騷擾；它們都是黑暗的偎鬼，它們都展着長爪，張着大口，在抓人吃人，然而，它們都戴着一個假面具，富有誘惑力和麻醉性的假面具，所以，不易為人察破，而反自甘自願的走入它們的圏子去，去膏它們的齒牙，結果，它們是勝利，你却完了，然而一個人這樣完了就算了嗎？這樣完了你的人生，你將何等對不住你自己，對不住你父母，更何等對不住社會並國家呀！所以，你欲發揮你的人生的意義，你便不能不特别着意你入世的第一步，你該正確你的意旨，縝密你的思想，鋭利你的眼光，振發你的精神，努力向黑暗奮鬥，尋找光明的大道而開步走。</p>
<p>真的，十六歳，一點不容忽視的，因為那時你將洒開你入世的第一步了。</p>

<p>— 張枕緑</p>
<p>那鶉衣百結，剛從地獄裏逃岀來的乞丏擠在花團錦簇，佈置得好像天堂一般的康莊大道上，非但破壞了都市的美觀，更且侵及羣衆的時間，衛生，甯靜的意志等等，尤其减滅本國人的國際的威儀，在華洋雜處之地。我們不能為了同情於他們的環境，而姑息容恕，任其自然。</p>
<p>在南京路上的乞丏，都是趕着行路人要錢的，那一流人物；他們的對象限於過路人，未見有店家麻煩的，他們的目的在現錢，通常心理以一個銅幣為應盡之義務，而他們的主要工作是「趕一，—在他們同業中的術語，稱為「趕猪玀」，顯然一個無賴的侮辱的名詞，既要你損失錢財，還把你看作畜類！</p>
<p>其中一個乞丐，年約三十，眼睛時常半開半掩，口角常呼着一小段香烟，面上浮混着烟色和菜色，穿一件短衣，這人有最多可以碰見的機會。他的特色是，一邊常像閉目養神而能快步趕着你，一看用本土口音滿口不停地嘮叨着。他的聲音是有意含糊，但又使你有時可以聽得岀一言半語。其他乞丐，也有在所欲不遂而灰心時候，漸漸離遠而作詆人的言語的，這個乞丏，他却不論你肯不肯給他錢，有時在開始追趕你，便發醜詞惡語可以聽得。又不論你是男，女，老，少，胆敢一視同仁地追罵。過路人若是婦女們，他更故意把含糊的語音放得淸楚一點，使人辨得岀他在謾罵中還雜有狎侮，譬如：「奶奶啊！小姐啊！救救我這窮極的人啊！你們都把我罷！……」大約他是仗着他骯髒的形態，和没落的地位，料到人家不值得和他理論的，或是熟習羣衆的忍辱負重，犯而不校的心理，所以他這樣地肆無忌憚，習以為常了罷！</p>
<p>又有一個女乞丐，年約四十左右，本地口音，記得似乎是麻面，伊的特色是能勤於乞工；伊可以趕着你走很長的一段路，不惜腰脚和口勁，直至錢到方休。伊得到你的給與，没一回兒又和你碰見了，諒伊是領悟了你樂善好施的性度，必來再度追逐你，追得更緊，除非你一再聲明不願再給了。不過，有時伊在趕你而未有獲得時，若然發現在你身上終於缺少希望的，或者劈面碰見一個或一夥比較指得穩的行路人，伊也决心放棄了你，用很熟習而輕快的動作，轉身去别行追求了。我曾見伊在瞬息的時間裏，輾轉往來換趕了好幾批的施主，那求討的口氣也緊接變更着，却是有趣！我也曾幾次瞧見伊搶在一羣窶人之前，索倒那包飯担上剔餘的飯菜。伊倒是一個丐業中的努力者，可稱為「標準女丐」。</p>
<p>一個老年的乞丐，留其鬚而長其衫，具有老紳士的觀瞻。他那一口不易辨淸的客邊口音，聒噪在人的耳旁，太不適意了！</p>
<p>他們三人是南京路上的常駐乞丐，風雨無阻，「黄昏時節又逢君」。他們的共同點，以緊趕，煩言，所憎於人，為獲得銅幣的手段，—自然，有時也趕外國人，而加强慾望。他們在趕時，必採取和你同樣速度的步伐。緊蹈你的後踪。在繁密的人叢中，你若偶因前面的特别情形而步調發生阻礙時，他們的身子會得撞到你身上來，或者踏掉你的鞋後跟，或者倒趕往你的面前去，—於是，為識趣計，為合於「趕」字的意義計，他們放慢脚步，或退縮回去，恢復一走一隨的原狀，而那骯髒的身子不須很密切地擦着你的衣服，在擁擠的環境裏是無法讓免。他們都没有什麽殘疾，都有練得很强的足力，和很長的説話精神，而甘於做這仰面求人的丐業。我想，他們當已了解「死要面子活受罪」的俗諺，情願「做末等生意，賺頭等銅錢」罷；在南京路上執行丐務，所得想當是不菲的。</p>

<h3 id="c193">懶人的哲學 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>也許是外在的原因—環境如此，也許是内在的原因—秉性如此，生就了一種懷疑的氣質，還外加了一副懶骨，從小的時候，一些年長的人，就認為既不可理喻的，又不可救藥的廢物，因為他們所講的一片大道理，我既不信，又不行，最後還加以嘲笑：比如一次某私塾師甲是個抽雅片的，有一次看到我，他大概那時雅片正抽足了，忽然興緻勃勃地對我説，「你是一個青年人呀，青年人應該有為，為什麽這樣懶？」我就不客氣對他説：「我的懶，也和你抽雅片一樣呀，這是我的嗜好，你既能抽雅片，我就不能懶麽？」講完後掉頭不顧而去，後來他見到我永遠不再提起我懶的事。又有一次一個放縱於色情的某乙見到我，他擺岀道貌岸然，令人起敬的氣概對我説：「你近來愈弄愈懶了。你也應該自愛呀！」我就隨口回答道：「我有什麽不自愛，我至少還潔身自好，没有去嫖得爛掉了鼻子，」這一下觸着的創疤，惱羞成怒，拍桌大罵，但他總有些内恧，也只好自己收篷而去。這種對付人家的方法，既行之有效，以後常用這種方法去對付那些好開口訓斥我的人，人家也覺得我這人雖然懶，也有些不易對付，見到我就不敢擺岀正人君子的態度，而我也省得了許多麻煩。</p>
<p>到了現在，年齡較大，懶的程度也自然較深。不過近來頗懂得了些世故，朋友好意問起了「為什麽這樣懶，頗不好意思直斥他們，只好推托説「我是個先天不足，後天營養不良的人，所以有了懶病」。但有些不識相的朋友還要窮追下去説：「看你面孔這樣紅潤，身體這樣堅實，並不像個病人」。我就無辭可對，即是勉强説：「這是我的人生哲學」。這自己也明知道是騙人的，因為懶人根本就没有哲學。懶人而有哲學，將不成為懶人，而將成為哲人，然而哲人却都是勸人勤勞，戒人懶惰的，你曾見幾名哲人讚美着懶惰過？</p>
<p>除非像晋朝的嵇叔夜那樣墮落的，自然是老莊思想者才會讚美懶惰，這原因是他自己即是個極懶的人。他的與山巨源（濤）絶交書中説：「少加孤露，母兄見驕，不涉經學，性復疏懶。筋駑肉緩，頭面常一月十五日不洗，不大悶養，不能沐也。每常小便，而忍不起，令胞中略轉乃起耳。…」最後幾句話，真是道岀了懶人的本色，夏天還可，到了冬天，睡在被中，小便對於懶人，確是極麻煩的事。懶人大都有這樣經騐，非到了十分廹不得已，才會起來去小解。懶人如不懶，要找一個古人做標榜，那末嵇叔夜就是歷史上的一個有趣人物。</p>
<p>前年英國哲學家羅素，也有一篇文章呌做懶惰的讚美（In　Praise　of　Idleness）登載九月號的Review　of　Reviews（英國的）上，他勸世界各地的青年會的領袖，應該起來勸誘世界青年走向懶惰。他認為現代工業已經這樣發達，人們不應該再像以前那般把他們全部時間，專化在謀衣食方面，尤其不應該消耗無數的金錢於戰争方面，應該有些多餘的時間去享受生活的樂趣。他並主張優閒應為一切人的東西，不應該多數人過分工作，而少數人專享優閑的工作。這種現代哲人的説教，自然要比嵇叔夜那般一味消極的懶惰高明得多。如果懶人而需要有哲學的話，羅素的話，自然我們可以全部抄襲過來的。不過羅素又説，遠東的國家（中國自然在内）還在前工業期（Pre-industriar），人類勞動所獲，並没有多量剩餘，所以這些國家内的人還不應該懶，應該努力工作以求達到工業化，然後才能懶惰。我們可以看岀羅素的讚美懶惰，是有其客觀條件的，像我們這樣的國家，我們這樣的人民，我也響亮地説一句，是不該懶惰的。我雖懶，我可以接受他的話，但當客觀環境不允許工業化，與國人不注意工業化問題時，我們這些人，即是不懶惰，又有什麽事可做，所以在這時代未來以前，我還是要懶惰，因為在我看來，懶惰也是一種美德，我認為羅素的意見是對的，懶惰應該讚美。</p>

<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>此刻唯有巴古里克，却帶着失望的神情，誰也料想不到他會把那美麗的希望丢棄了。</p>
<p>—巴彦王為什麽把牲口收去三分之一才讓我們動身到達里岡厓呢？—這個疑問從昨天起就在巴古里克腦子裏萌了芽，此刻是擴大起來了，他想從各方面，去尋找這疑問的答案。</p>
<p>於是巴古里克，用油亮的袖子擦了擦臉上的汗，聚精會神的看了他女兒安尼拉一眼，又轉過臉去看那些醬紫色的騎在駱駝上的人們，看流着汗的牲畜，看這郡被希望之火燃着的行列……最後又看到了巴彦王的使臣諾音，穿着巴彦賜給他的醬紫醬紫的，發着油津津的亮光的衣服，身上背着槍，威風懍懍的在後邊督促着這羣長長的行列。</p>
<p>「觸景生情」，巴古里克想起了；小的時候，跟着他祖母，爸爸，媽，許許多多的人，從畢哈圖奉巴音王命遷到努庫台平原，情形和現在完全一樣，臨走的時候，巴音王派使臣收去了牧民的三分之一的牲口。趕到了努庫台，人們把牲口快殺光了，每個人僅僅還剩下一匹馬，或是一個駱駝，再不然就是一頭牛或一隻羊。努庫台天氣又是那般冷，牲口又不吃那種荜草，有很多的餓死了，人們把牲口吃完，也就餓死了。巴古里克的一家人都死光了，他一個人獨自騎了一個駱駝，逃到努庫台平原南部……這回恐怕是把那次的悲劇再重演一次！他找到了這準確的答案，立刻由失望而變為憤怒，他眼前是淋漓的血跡，枯瘦的僵尸……他忍不住喊起來了：</p>
<p>—我們上了當了！</p>
<p>像一顆炸彈在羣衆中爆炸了，鋭利的眼睛百隻，千隻，萬隻……射滿巴古里克身。</p>
<p>—我們受騙了！巴彦王哄去我們的牲口，呌我們到達里岡厓去送死！</p>
<p>—巴古里克發痴了嗎？</p>
<p>帳幕剛搭起，驟然冷起來，接着括起大風，沙滿空飛，打着蒙古包，嘩唦嘩唦響：太陽早就落了，黑暗掩没了沙漠，掩没了天，掩没了蒙古包！掩没了……</p>
<p>風越括越兇，沙不住氣的往蒙古包上飛。外邊不知誰在喊着：</p>
<p>—扎喀薩的帳幕呌沙壓塌了！扎喀薩壓在裏面！</p>
<p>一陣騷動，孩子呌哭，女人咒罵着這大風！年輕的人在扒着塌了的蒙古包。</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>不知什麽時候，騷動平靜了，巴古里克的奮怒一直没有停止在胸中燃燒，在蒙古包裏走一陣，坐一陣，思想像是在他心上打了結。</p>
<p>女兒安尼拉已經看透了她爸爸的心事，這種心事慢慢的延退下去，很容易變成煩惱！爸爸的皮氣她很知道，她不忍苦惱纏住他爸爸，於是她笑迷迷的説：</p>
<p>—爸爸，一天怪乏的，早點睡吧，不是諾音使臣説，明天就可以到達里岡厓嗎？</p>
<p>—諾音的話一定靠不住，達里岡厓不是天堂，那裏是我們這羣牧民的地獄！那裏是什麽也不會有的！天底下那有冬天不下雪的寶地！我們是受了欺騙了！</p>
<p>安尼拉的話不但不能救滅巴古里克憤怒的火，反而火上加了油。</p>
<p>—趕快睡吧，爸爸！何必生悶氣！</p>
<p>和女兒躺下，閉上眼，心撲撲跳，等到女兒睡熟了，他悄悄的爬岀了蒙古包。</p>
<p>人們安息着，風咆哮着，黑暗的淫威，沙的飛騰，一切在消磨着沙漠上的夜。</p>
<p>第二天早上，在諾音使臣的帳幕裏發現了兩個屍首躺在血泊中，那不是别人，是巴古里克和諾音使臣，巴古里克手中的刀還握得結結實實。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c196">談迷信 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 佛朗</p>
<p>以為蠢笨的人才迷信，這意見是算不盡然的。往往豪傑之士才會迷信，才懂得迷信的真道理。</p>
<p>豪傑之士，是指「專識時務」者來講，識時務便當是聰明的人，聰明的人迷信，他的迷信可絶不是蠢事。</p>
<p>記得年紀小時候，讀韓愈的諫迎佛骨表，覺得他是頂不相信神佛之類的，心裏兀自佩服！因為在韓愈那時，連皇帝都愛好和尚，尊崇木偶，要把「死佛」抬到國門，可謂迷信到極，但韓愈竟敢冒不諱，説岀一大番破除迷信的大道理，去碰皇帝的釘子，直有點文起八代之衰的持正樣子。但到後來去唸着他的一篇祭鱷魚文，却全不是那回事。以這樣一位破除迷信的先生，跑到潮州做官，不想切實的辦法去除鱷魚的害，却焚香禱祝，拿文章去祭鱷魚，呌它們「率爾醜類」趕快滚蛋，未免仍屬是迷信的。但書上却明明載着鱷魚第二天就滚蛋了，當時真弄得我莫明其妙。可是後來年紀大了些，才恍然韓愈後來祭鱷魚是比起先諫迎佛骨聰明進步得多了。韓愈因為諫迎佛骨抛了高官，才貶到潮州，他因此學會了迷信的把戲，他知道迷信是很聰明的一件事，不能去怪那皇帝，於是應用起這法寶來。他的祭鱷魚文的意思，大概是知道那地方的民風很有點蠻横，怕吃了虧，便想岀了這麽一個方法來作下馬威，韓愈這次却并非是儍事，他打聽好潮水的漲退，才故意胡謅一篇文章，説是把鱷魚當真嚇退的，骨子裏，那篇文章的用意，却完全不是這會事。</p>
<p>這樣，迷信的涵義，是要解釋到「迷」人而自不「信」，才算發揮了迷信的至高意義；年來昝們貴國迷信之風是隨復古而甚見興盛的，從科學靈乩以至唸咒却敵，自然都是識時務的聰明人一種小聰明的買弄，聽説科學靈乩的發明家已經靠「碟仙」賺了一份三四萬塊錢的家當，他的小巧的把戲是成功了。在此，我又想到前幾天貼在北四川路某一家照相館前的一幅鬼影。據説這鬼影—一個糢糊不淸的鬼頭—是在青天白日下從攝影機攝影岀來的。因此，每天這間照相館面前堆滿許多人在看，而標在鬼影旁邊的一行小字，是：可供科學家研究，每張小洋二角。</p>
<p>照相館的主人是聰明的，碟仙的發明家是聰明的，提倡佛力禦敵的人是聰明的，甚至韓愈的祭鱷魚也是聰明的—然而，世上聰明的人也很多，聰明人的小聰明，究竟能不能迷人相信到底呢？狐狸的秃尾巴，我想，一下子就得露岀來的。</p>

<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>有淚在他眼窪裏發光，像當真在步行了千百里之後，帶着疲倦了的肚子，又饑又渴。臉上浮起臃腫的光，似笑而非笑，也許是對行人施與的輕蔑和憐憫。貪婪的望着從他身邊慌惶經過的旅客的臉。從那藏灰的胡子下發岀聲音：</p>
<p>「香莩，吾？不會白化的……南海觀音香莩……」</p>
<p>真是從鬍子下發岀的聲音哩，怎樣也不像是在説話哪。</p>
<p>他不同一般江湖客蠻横無理。以無恥的手扯住行人不放；或者拉一個所謂「誘子」，用打通的詞令，擺好的圏套將人弄昏，然後探手人家腰裏取岀錢來。他所用的方法近乎乞求，他説他並非賣藥營生者，而是受了囑託為人代辦，因為途中短了盤川，不得不便宜岀售。大家呢，也不是買藥，而是救援人在難中。香莩作算報答的禮物。</p>
<p>他伸岀食指戳着那欠正的鼻，眼無依的落在那些漠然的臉上，等待魚自己投進網裏。實在他此時不再像人，而倒是一個䘮家的狗。</p>
<p>淺笑由鬚根下痙攣的展佈開去，他咳嗽着，轉換了口訣和調子，聲音稍微提高。</p>
<p>「這寶物，」他揑一顆像橄欖核的東西放到鼻尖上，説：「岀自南海普陀山，普陀寺，乃觀音老母所植……」</p>
<p>這裏也許有人用——</p>
<p>「南海？可是南海大士的南海？」</p>
<p>這話打斷他。他仔細看那人是否要買，隨後像是快活了的顛着那多毛的頭，答道：</p>
<p>「對啦。」</p>
<p>不自主的荷荷笑一陣子，也是有的。那説話的遲疑着，望着别人的臉，並不要買。也許竟頭也回的逕自走掉。但他並不因之動氣。也知道那已去的人不會再回來招顧他，他也不再向那人多送一眼，就向周圍的老實漢解釋；這寶物十二年開花結子，不拘大小百病，十年不遇，十年不治，三顆包好……他更慷慨的將手中的一顆咬碎，送近每一個人的鼻端，很有把握的説着：</p>
<p>「來，真的搓在身上有薄荷凉……可别上了當，鄰居……來，來……」</p>
<p>用另一隻手背在帽沿下搓着顱頂，突然生氣了的，他嚷了：</p>
<p>「只賣十顆，十個！不嫌貴的來。」</p>

<p>— 宸</p>
<p>我們的文學博士胡適先生，五四時曾領導青年反抗過舊社會，也曾倡導過婦女解放運動，聲名播於一時。大概現在業已功德圓滿，於各種均已「嘗試」之後，此刻就呈現岀十分樂觀的論調了。前些時博士説，二十年來中國婦女解放已經進步很多，打破了舊家庭舊禮教，婚姻戀愛已自由，婦女已參加各種社會事業，經濟獨立，政治平等，小脚已變天足，且已使中國女子成為世界最美的女子，這是提倡新文化之胡適博士對於目前婦女解放的認識。</p>
<p>因為樂觀的原因，博士對於現時正嘆「走頭無路」的學生失業問題，發表了他與衆不同的見解。據六號與日日社記者的談話，博士謂：「本人執教北大，所見之大學畢業生甚多，除最少數有特殊情形者外，大多能於畢業後謀得相當職業…其少數不能就職，則因學而不能適用，岀路較為窄狹，如顧頡剛由研究哲學而改攻歷史，陳公博亦由研究哲學而從事實業。」并云，欲任事愉快，無失業之慮，第一須有任事之能力與學識，燕京每届畢業生之能先期被人争聘，蓋因其能予社會以良好印象，反之不能就業者，當求其不能就業之原因，不必怨天尤人，而唯責之於己，自己有能力，又何愁無飯吃。</p>
<p>萬事求諸己，躬自厚而薄責於人，這是我們十足國粹的處世哲學，以青年前導的適之先生，諄諄的誥誡現刻「愁無飯吃」的青年學子應當自省，實在無愧本色，敬佩之至。可是目前許多早已「責之於己，」亦未曾「怨天尤人」的青年學生，也不能「無失業之慮」是又令我對博士的訓誨不能無疑，且不能已於言者。</p>
<p>誠如博士所云，由研究哲學而攻歷史從事實業者極多，我們亦同樣看到許多工學士理學士的留學生大學生，跑到政治舞台上去作官僚政客。然而這不是甚麽無「任事之能力與學識，」恰正説明中國整個經濟在内外的種種桎梏下不得發展，不能容納這許多的拿了文憑要吃飯者。目前許多學生在此經濟恐慌中，已經極度的紆尊貶價岀售，終難找一噉飯之地，這樣還要他們「不怨天尤人，」「責之於己，」不是掩蓋一般學生失業的事實，便是勸人安心餓肚子。其次，固然有的學校畢業生能先期被人争聘，然而他們是幸運兒，否則是裙或帶的關係，使他們「無愁飯吃；」或者是鄉友世交族誼等，使他們獲得「社會的良好印象。」某機關之變為什麽同鄉會同學會某某宗祠等，不是使我們時常聽到的麽？</p>
<p>時代决定了目前學生失業的必然命運，許多無夤縁時會的幸運的學生，勸他們「不怨天尤人」「責之於己，」又何用呢？</p>

<p>棉絮樣的十月的風啊！在江邊飄拂。</p>
<p>—裘麗！</p>

<p>什麽？你説，你老這樣地呌我。看你像要什麽似的。説啊！你要什麽哪。</p>
<p>年青人的手掌裏冒着汗。嘴一張，下巴却抖了。</p>
<p>—是的我的裘麗，我想……</p>
<p>在高闊的胸部下，裘麗那寶　　的大眸子偷偷望着年青人的臉蛋　　　般情恩燃紅了的臉蛋。</p>
<p>裘麗看岀了他的心事，伸手把他的臉頰旋過來，對準了自己誘惑的眼珠。</p>
<p>—你想什麽啊！看，放在我們眼前的，這動人的江景，我們該怎樣來享受呀！</p>
<p>—是的。</p>
<p>—你來。</p>

<p>跳到艙裏，裘麗吩咐船夫隨便地在江上摇着。</p>
<p>船一偏，裘麗害怕得什麽似的倒在年青人懷裏。</p>
<p>—我怕，你快把我抱住呀！</p>
<p>抱了一個謎樣的女人，年青人痴痴地想着，想着自從認識了她錢化得很多啦！雖然她對自己很親熱，瞧她為什麽老微笑着不同自己訂婚呢？</p>
<p>想着，想着，身子一陣冷，汗毛孔開啦！</p>
<p>—怎麽？你發抖。</p>
<p>裘麗把他挾得緊緊的，她看着他今晚臉色有點二樣，於是，她又用手去撫摸他的臉頰。</p>

<p>—水冷呢，手不是要凍壞嗎？</p>
<p>—不會的，有着你的熱烈，我一點都不覺得冷。</p>
<p>年青人的臉在不自覺中是沉沉的。裘麗看這模樣，想呀想的，忽然對他説有動聽的故事講給他聽。</p>
<p>但，一天到晚忙着的裘麗，她腦子里有着些什麽呢？她想了好一嚮，才胡亂地指着陸上的建築，説房子多高啊！説年虹燈多紅啊！説張網捕魚的又多…</p>
<p>年靑人的思緒給她攪得粉碎了。他茫茫地跟她的手指望着，他看捕魚的，看年虹燈，看高房子，看一個個碼頭，看長髮的人獨個兒在碼頭上躑躅，又像看見這長髮的人縱身跳到浦裏，他看得呆了。</p>
<p>裘麗的笑聲却又鑽到他的耳裏，她説：</p>
<p>—這秋凉的夜裏，還有人到這裏來游泳，難道不怕冷嗎？真是賤骨。</p>
<p>她又説：到這里來游泳的全是下賤的。明年夏天，她將同他到北戴河去避暑，到那邊去游泳是高尚的。</p>
<p>説着又笑。然而，今晚上，他覺得裘麗的笑聲有些淫蕩氣味了。</p>
<h3 id="c200">饑餓的一羣 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>擠……擠……擠……</p>
<p>在施粥廠前，黑越越的擁着一大堆人，堆子是打得緊緊的，人頭在不住地波動；男的，女的，老的，少的，嚷着，嘈着，哭着，呌着，週遭的空氣裏，飛揚着灰砂和塵土。但人堆子儘管是越打越大。</p>
<p>今天阿長叔來得較遲，所以被擠在最外面；他挾了一隻缽頭，準備領到一缽頭粥回去，好給自己老夫妻倆和一個十一歳的兒子三口子飽一飽久攝的肚子。可是人又那麽多，説不定今天又要像前天一樣，空着缽頭回去啦！他這樣的想着，心裏不覺沉重起來；於是運用足了全身所有的力氣，拚命的向前挨。然而前面還是一動不動，在他的後面却又圍上了好些人，他給擠在里面，窒息得透不過氣來，要想退岀去鬆一口氣，但想到脇下挾着的鉢頭還空着，終於祗好忍着擠軋，而他自己兩隻脚早已離地面約莫有四五寸高了。飄飄忽忽的隨着人潮的掀翻而移動，前面施粥廠的兩扇大門依舊没有開，門楞子却被擠得格外響；有時前面一陣激動，許多人的脚跟都站立不穩，那些强壯的漢子倒還可以挨受，這班女人和上年紀的老頭兒老太婆，却委實吃不消了。他們只有在裏面呌救命！</p>
<p>數百個人，個個都伸長了𩓐子，把數百對眼珠子盯住了施粥廠的兩扇門，一副饑餓和焦灼的嘴臉，不住地對面前嘆氣！</p>
<p>「媽的，今天不開門了嗎？我們的膀子都站得酸了。」阿長叔實在站得不耐煩了，他憤憤的咕噥着嚷了起來。</p>
<p>「真的，往天晚到二點鐘準要開門的，今天烟囱上烟都不岀，恐怕不會開門啦！」站在阿長叔身傍的那青年漢子，也失望地説。阿長叔也認識他的，他就是對岸河埠頭的金根，他家同自己一樣的生活不下去。本來，這些年頭，别説自己和金根，就是全村子的人，也都在饑餓的羣里打旋。連年兵燹又夾着大水，有錢的人都已逃到了城市里去了，現在鄉下的土匪又是那麽多，到處還不是閙着搶劫，嚷着饑餓，這樣的日子，鄉下人真是活受罪。全村的人那一家能够飽飽的嚥一頓大米飯，反正誰都在連糙糠也不着落！而且老天爺偏要收拾窮人的性命：所以今年又來這麽一個亘古未有的亢旱，收成落了個空，可是田租糧税却不怕你短少了分毫。以後的日子真不知怎樣的過下去呢；今天，明天，後天，還有後天……他心里愈想愈痛苦，肚腸上已打了一百個結，他簡直不敢再往下想了。</p>
<p>「本廠購米未到，施粥暫停，此啓。」施粥廠的門上，突然有人來掛上了一塊白牌子。於是一陣喧譁，數百個腦袋又在太陽光下幌動，失望的面孔，饑餓的眼睛，哭的喊的嘆的聲音，混成了一片，幾乎把這世界都撼翻了。</p>

<p>— 皮</p>
<p>前日某小學一學生被綁，幸即察覺，當將肉票追回，月拿獲綁匪一名，據供，現在大票不大好做，因為做大票，必須用手槍，租汽車，容易尋獲綫索，萬一失風，往往釀成血案，而至蝕本，所以現在改變方針，專做小票，一不須手槍，二不須汽車，存本校較輕，綁票亦易，每張肉票，價僅五百元，即被綁者亦容易應付，真是綁票者之薄利多賣者，現在商業不景氣，所以用薄利多賣主義，賤價招來，不料綁匪亦用此法，專做小肉票，此真綁票之别開生面者。</p>

<p>— 哲人</p>
<p>（三）英雄主義</p>
<p>孩子是没有自身語價的，他不知道人類在宇宙裏邊，個人在社會裏邊的地位；他只是睁着好奇的眼觀察四週的事物，却忽略了「自我」這東西，所以他設有痛苦。可是當孩子生長起來能運用理性來思維的時候；「我究竟是怎樣的一種現實，怎樣的一種存在呢？」那樣的問題怕會終日炊惱着他吧。於是，他便開始從堆積在記憶裏的經騐，知識，和對事物的認識裏邊，抽岀一個尺度來，把人類在廣漠的宇宙中的位置，個人在複雜的社會構造中的位置衡量一下，自身評價便慢慢地形成了。然而這時的評價往往超過實際的「我」的價值，就因為這誇大的評價，年青人時常有着堅强的自信力，潑刺的氣分，充滿了架在半空的幻想，把人生看作滿開了薔薇花的坦道。等到他走岀學校的大門，離開父母的羽翼，單身跨入社會，在主觀的「自我」和客觀的「非我」的鬥争的過程中，就會發現「自我」的薄弱，對自身評價的數字上的錯誤了吧？「自我」原來是一點自由意志也没有，一點力量也没有，完全被决定於「非我」的衝東西呵！永恒的悲劇便從這裏展開了。一切思想的中心，經騐，知識，理智，精神上的儲蓄頓時崩潰了下來。在這樣的時候，人還能生存下去麽？</p>
<p>可是不能生存下去，又怎麽辦呢？於是單獨的人性便分歧起來，社會也有了萬華撩亂的種種相。有的變了懷疑主</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>義者，有的變了虚無主義者，有的變了浮士德和　吉訶德，也有人進了瘋人醫院　有人去睡在火車軌上，而種種思想，種種人生哲學也從這裏發生了。</p>
<p>人生的定命是一個永恒的悲劇：這是一個客觀地在在着的真理的命題。隨便你學釋迦牟尼那樣斬六賊，斷五情，消滅感覺使無法體騐人生苦也好，學波特來爾那樣吸食雅片，沉湎色情中以麻醉自己也好，那悲劇的命運總是殘酷地要到來的。避免痛苦是一個看似聰明，其實愚笨的方法，而且那樣卑鄙而懦怯的態度不正是應該被我們輕視的態度麽？</p>
<p>對於人生，我們不應該閉上了眼，應該勇敢地面對着牠，承認牠是無可避免的悲劇，而同牠反抗，用戰鬥的精神做我們生活的基礎，那樣的英雄主義不是我們所應該欽佩的麽？讓我們來學學駱駝，學學獅子，學學嬰兒吧！駱駝那樣忍苦耐勞的去認識人生，獅子那樣地去摧毁了傳統的人生，摧毁一切妥恊，畏避，然後再做一個嬰兒去重新肯定，重新創造吧！人類的父化和幸福不是唯物主義者那樣跟了歷史的定命去而獲得的，是戰鬥的英雄主義的結果。讓我們這受難的一羣來要求自己的戰鬥力，自己的意志吧。</p>

<p>竭三人之力，費二載時間，僅發明了如「酒醉」而已的一個玩意兒，似乎覺得太浪費了。在第二次世界大戰的前夜，應該發明什麽功效在「酒醉」以上的殺人利器；而法蘭西不此之圖。留法朋友説，法國女人最可愛，我説那工程師更可愛呢。</p>

<p>黑大個正在夢中和弟兄們推牌九，拿了一付「梅花九」想「吃通」呢，却呌人家吵醒啦，這是多掃興啊！一翻身坐起來，嘴裏不淸不白的罵着：</p>
<p>「日你個舅子的！俺還……」他剛罵到這裏睁眼一看，眼前可岀毛病了！三個穿着破爛灰色軍服的兵不像兵，老百姓不像老百姓，手裏都拿着槍的傢伙立在他跟前。</p>

<p>Visits Racecourse and Reviews Boy Scouts</p>
<p>Soong Cheh-yuan and Yang Yung-tai Arrived in Taiyuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Guihua: Chairman Chiang, on the morning of the 7th at 8:00 AM, disembarked from his special train to the headquarters to meet with Prince Yun, Prince De, Xiao Zhenying, and Prince Pan. He inquired about Mongolian politics and offered considerable encouragement. Subsequently, he summoned provincial party committee member Ji Shouguang and others. At 11:00 AM, he visited the Martyrs' Park. At 12:00 PM, he returned to the station to rest. At 2:00 PM, he addressed a gathering at the Xiaojiaochang Lianhuan Society. Over 500 government officials and military officers of company commander rank and above attended the address. Prince Yun, Prince De, Prince Pan, Bao Yueqing, Soong Cheh-yuan, Yang Yung-tai, Zhao Chengshou, Wang Jingguo, and others also participated. Chiang encouraged all circles to embody the spirit of self-improvement, implement the New Life Movement, revive traditional virtues, uphold the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace, and the four cardinal principles of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, and establish the foundation for national revival. After his address, he invited Prince De to speak. De stated that Chiang was the first national leader to inspect the Mongolian border in over 200 years, expressing hope for solidarity among the five races and joint efforts under Chiang's leadership. Following the meeting, Chiang, accompanied by Soong Mei-ling and others, visited the woolen mill, the agricultural and forestry experiment station, and the provincial government. They also toured the Litutai observation platform. Furthermore, the Suiyuan Construction Department convened a horse race on the 7th, featuring over forty prize-winning horses from the current horse show, divided into four groups for competition and equestrian demonstrations. Chiang was invited to observe, and both Chiang and Soong attended. As a result, Li Defu, a twelve-year-old boy from Guisui, won the horse championship. Chiang and Soong applauded enthusiastically. After the race, Li rode his horse to the front of the reviewing stand, where Chiang and Soong personally inquired about Li's name and age, awarding him 500 yuan. In addition to the 50 yuan awarded to Li, the remainder was distributed among the others. Subsequently, Chiang returned to his headquarters and held a tea party for various foreign missionaries. On the 7th, Chiang hosted a banquet for Prince Yun, Prince De, Xiao Zhenying, Bao Yueqing, Prince Pan, and others. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Guihua: Chairman Chiang, on the morning of the 7th at 9:00 AM, met with Prince Yun, Prince De, Bao Yueqing, and Xiao Zhenying at the headquarters in the Public Hospital, expressing deep concern about Mongolian affairs. Prince Yun and Prince De were extremely pleased. He also summoned the provincial party committee, the provincial committee, and various Suiyuan military generals, offering considerable encouragement to the foreign missionaries. At noon, Fu Zuoyi hosted a banquet at the provincial government in honor of Chiang and his wife, as well as Yang Yung-tai, Xuan Tiewu, Donald, Qian Zongze, and Shen Chang, inviting Soong Cheh-yuan, Zhao Chengshou, Wang Jingguo, the provincial party committee, the provincial committee, and foreign missionaries to attend. At 2:00 PM, he attended a joint celebration meeting of all circles in Suiyuan. At 3:00 PM, he visited the Suiyuan Woolen Mill, the library, and the agricultural and forestry experiment station. At 4:00 PM, he inspected the provincial government. At 5:00 PM, he went to the racecourse to watch the horse race. Chiang and his wife were very pleased, greatly praising Li Defu, the twelve-year-old boy who won first place in the final race, awarding him 50 yuan, with the remainder distributed among the others. Subsequently, he reviewed the Boy Scouts and students from ten schools at the racecourse. Chiang was in excellent spirits, still wearing his black cloak despite the howling wind and not feeling the cold. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Guihua: Chairman Chiang's special train arrived in Datong at 5:00 PM on the 5th. Zhao Chengshou, Li Fuying, and approximately 200 people from all walks of life gathered at the station to welcome him. Chiang, accompanied by Soong Mei-ling, Yang Yung-tai, Xuan Tiewu, and others, disembarked and immediately toured the Yungang Grottoes by car. At 6:30 PM, they quickly returned to the special train. The train remained in Datong on the night of the 5th. On the morning of the 6th at 11:00 AM, it headed west. Fu Zuoyi and Wang Jingguo had previously arrived at Pingdiquan to welcome him. The special train arrived in Suiyuan at 9:00 PM on the evening of the 6th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Democratic Party's Victory in the US General Election <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>According to recent American dispatches, the Democratic Party has once again secured victory in the recent US congressional elections. According to the US Constitution, the House of Representatives is re-elected every two years, and one-third of the Senate is re-elected every two years. Now that the Democratic Party has maintained its overwhelming majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Roosevelt's New Deal, implemented over the past year and a half, should be able to move forward without facing undue obstruction.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party's victory this time is naturally an indication of the American people's trust in Roosevelt's New Deal. The world often takes a pessimistic view of the American recovery movement, and the actual performance has not provided us with evidence for optimism. For example, since the beginning of summer this year, labor strikes have occurred frequently, and the situation has been extremely unstable, indicating that although Roosevelt's recovery movement has been vigorously promoted, the results have not been satisfactory.</p>
<p>However, why did the American people still support the Democratic Party in this general election? This is not difficult to explain. In short, Roosevelt's ability to quickly stop the unprecedented financial panic in the United States in early 1933 cannot be said to be a great success. The financial panic in the United States in early 1933 was the result of the global recession after 1929, and it was also an inevitable outcome of the United States' abnormally developed industry. Before the Great War, although the United States was already a modern industrial nation, its rapid industrial growth was actually a gift from the European war. During this war, the production enterprises of European countries were almost entirely suspended, and even the replenishment of military supplies depended on the United States. American industry, which was formerly confined to the domestic market, took off on the world stage. The speed of its expansion and development was unprecedented in other countries. However, the wealth obtained by Americans at that time was largely of an accounting nature, and there was not much real benefit. Therefore, when the Great War ended, what the Americans got was a huge war debt and an oversized industrial equipment. However, in the eight or nine years that followed, (1) the post-war recovery of European countries still depended on American material assistance; (2) the United States was still able to maintain its foreign trade; and (3) European countries had not yet taken action to rely on debt. Therefore, although the conditions for the American economic panic were already in place, the people were still intoxicated in a false prosperity without realizing it. However, after 1929, due to the increase in tariff barriers in various countries and the decline in foreign trade, this economic weakness gradually became exposed. By the beginning of 1933, it had become a major economic panic. Thousands of banks went bankrupt. The value of various securities and stocks also fell sharply. The losses amounted to 90 percent. The United States, which was known as the only wealthy country in the world during the war, still experienced such a great panic. It is conceivable how difficult it is today to restore the prosperity of the United States during the few years after the war. If we observe Roosevelt's recovery movement from this perspective, we will not be inclined to nitpick.</p>
<p>The great outbreak of the American financial panic was still before Roosevelt took office. However, after he took office, he was able to reverse the tide, which cannot but make people admire the effectiveness of his measures. Overall, Roosevelt's recovery plan can be summarized in approximately five points: (1) devaluing the currency; (2) relieving unemployment; (3) managing industry; (4) relieving agriculture; and (5) expanding lending. The main objectives are: (1) to make it easier for debtors to repay their debts and curb the trend of bankruptcy; (2) to raise prices and revitalize the market; (3) to increase the purchasing power of the people; (4) to improve the treatment of workers; and (5) to restrict individualistic business practices. From these points, it is clear that Roosevelt's policy is based on the welfare of the majority of the people.</p>
<p>In the past year and a half, although the recovery movement has not achieved great results, there are still some aspects that are barely satisfactory. For example, in terms of prices in general, by the end of September this year, they had risen by about 28 percent. In terms of raw materials, they had risen by about 43 percent. In terms of agricultural products, they had risen by about 64 percent. Compared with the pre-war period, both agricultural and industrial products have exceeded the pre-war level. In terms of production, with the exception of heavy industry, many daily necessities have increased to the level of 1923-1925. And the income of farmers this year has also increased significantly compared to last year. Therefore, on the whole, Roosevelt's recovery plan cannot be said to have had considerable success. From this point of view, the Democratic Party's re-election victory this time is no accident. Some people criticize Roosevelt's dictatorship, but they do not know that Roosevelt has the support of Congress and is a conditional and time-limited dictator. This is very different from the dictatorships of Hitler and Mussolini. Moreover, the main purpose of this kind of dictatorship is to make extraordinary contributions to the country, so it is beneficial and without drawbacks. Furthermore, Roosevelt has recently expressed his intention to gradually improve the recovery plan, which means that his future policies will not be immutable. For these reasons, it is fitting that the Democratic Party has won again.</p>

<h3 id="e68">British Proposal of a New Plan, Future of Naval Conference Still Bleak <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>United States and Japan Insist on Original Positions</p>
<p>British Efforts at Mediation Unlikely to Succeed</p>
<p>[London] The American and Japanese representatives have not responded to the British proposal to break the deadlock in the naval talks, so the future is very bleak. The plan was notified to the Japanese delegation yesterday, suggesting that Britain, the United States, and Japan should issue a joint declaration, acknowledging in principle Japan's equal rights in terms of security. In addition, each country should voluntarily issue a unilateral declaration, stating its naval defense needs, in lieu of binding treaty restrictions. Japanese experts expressed their dissatisfaction with the technical points today. Although the Japanese delegation has not closed the door to further consideration of the British plan, it has indicated that it cannot agree. The American side is also unwilling to make a friendly gesture toward the British plan. Although the American representatives advocate concluding a solid agreement or treaty, and are willing to retain the Washington Naval Treaty and maintain the 5:5:3 ratio, a formal response will only be made after detailed research. Foreign Office Clerk had an audience with the American chief representative Davis this morning to explain the British plan and had a conversation for an hour and a half. The American side now feels that in the current stage of the talks, the British and Japanese representatives should contact each other, and after a compromise is reached, the American representatives will participate in a larger scope. General public opinion believes that since both the United States and Japan insist on their original positions, the British efforts at mediation will naturally fail, because in the view of the Japanese, it does not satisfy their desire for equality, and in the view of the Americans, they feel that they have made too many concessions. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] The British and Japanese delegations formally held naval talks again this afternoon. The Japanese proposal has not changed slightly as a result, so it is expected that the negotiations will fail. The only hopeful feature of the exchange of views between the representatives of Britain, the United States, and Japan is that all three parties are willing to work together to prevent a naval arms race. Japan's demand for equality has not yet been accepted by the British and American delegations, and it is expected that the breakdown of future negotiations will be caused by this reef. Today's British-Japanese representatives meeting was held in Prime Minister MacDonald's office in the House of Commons and lasted for an hour and a half. Neither side made any substantive suggestions, only discussing the Japanese proposal. As for the British representatives' proposal to allow Japan to gradually achieve equal status, it has been firmly denied by the authorities. According to Japanese sources, today's meeting did not mention the issue of gradual equality, or equality in principle, but with a postscript that equality would not be immediate. The next meeting will likely be a formal meeting of all British and Japanese representatives, but the date has not been determined. The talks at the current stage are aimed at making the representatives of Britain, the United States, and Japan harmonious. The confidential nature of the talks has not been revealed. Judging from the current situation, the American representatives feel that a compromise is unlikely to succeed, because both Britain and the United States advocate maintaining the naval ratio, while Japan insists on equality and wants to adopt the total tonnage system. The American representatives especially feel that the naval talks will not only fail to reach a compromise, but will also end without any results. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Acknowledging the Principle of Japanese Equality</p>
<p>Distinguishing Between Offensive and Defensive Restrictions</p>
<p>[London] The Labor Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, reported that the British government is continuing its mediation efforts for the naval conference preparatory talks, and it is reported that it has put forward the following two suggestions: (1) Britain, the United States, and Japan jointly issue a declaration, acknowledging without reservation in principle Japan's equal rights in terms of security; (2) Britain, the United States, and Japan issue unilateral declarations, specifying the ship-building procedures that each country considers necessary to resist naval attacks, in order to avoid any restrictive clauses. The Daily Herald also said that the time for France and Italy to participate in the preparatory talks may be earlier than generally expected, so that they can express their opinions on this new plan. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] British Prime Minister MacDonald put forward a compromise plan at the fourth British-Japanese meeting. This plan, in a certain form, recognizes the principle of equality of armaments for the Japanese government, while stipulating restrictions. The content is as follows: (1) Stipulating a form different from the Japanese government's proposal to recognize the equality of armaments for Japan; (2) The method of restricting naval power is not a common maximum doctrine, but a compromise between the total tonnage doctrine and the ship number restriction doctrine; (3) Requiring the distinction between offensive and defensive forces to be mitigated.

<p>Seeking Substantive Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>Fundamental Policy Does Not Allow Concessions</p>
<p>[Tokyo] British Prime Minister MacDonald made a compromise proposal during the British-Japanese talks, the content of which was to nominally recognize Japan's equal rights in armaments, but on the premise that Britain, the United States, and Japan would conclude a gentleman's agreement to achieve the reality of disarmament through self-restraint. Here is a summary of the naval authorities' opinions on this news:</p>
<p>Although the principle of equality is recognized nominally, if it does not contain substance, it is equivalent to meaningless. As for how the self-restraint disarmament in the proposal will be expressed in numerical terms, it is currently unclear, but the result is that the method only wants to extend the existing ratio system in practice. Prime Minister MacDonald is nominally preserving Japan's face, but in reality, it is a strategy to protect the superior position of Britain and the United States. However, what Japan should consider is always the abolition of differential ratios and the establishment of equal rights to disarmament as fundamental. (Dentsu dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the compromise plan put forward by Britain, the Navy Ministry has not yet received an official telegram, but the naval authorities hold the following views:</p>
<p>(1) Although the form is different from the Japanese government's plan, it respects the face of various countries and recognizes the principle of equality of armaments in principle, but if it does not conform to Japan's doctrine and主張, it cannot be accommodated. Regarding Japan's fundamental policy, there is no room for the slightest concession.</p>
<p>(2) Japan is also not insisting on its own views regarding the method of restricting naval power. Once the content of the US countermeasures is examined, if it is in line with Japan's doctrine, it should be dealt with appropriately.</p>
<p>(3) What is offensive force and what is defensive force is a problem that has existed for many years. Even the Geneva General Disarmament Conference had already discussed it extensively and could not reach a consensus. It cannot be simply stipulated. If the British proposal is clarified, Japan must also be prepared to conduct a deep examination, and so on. (Japanese United News dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">U.S. Attitude Cool <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Election Victory Strengthens Government's Position</p>
<p>Japan's Treaty Abrogation Ultimately Detrimental</p>
<p>[Washington] A London dispatch states that the British Prime Minister MacDonald's suggestion for a compromise on naval issues has been met with a very cool reception from official circles here. The London dispatch said that the British Prime Minister suggested that Japan accept the principle of naval equality, but that the three countries form a "gentleman's agreement," each not building warships beyond a certain total tonnage limit. Officials here also doubt whether Japan can accept MacDonald's proposal, as Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito recently stated that Japan insists on achieving complete equality within a certain period of time. Today's official reaction seems to confirm previous indications that American officials and the public are gradually agreeing to let Japan abrogate the Washington and London Naval Treaties without hindering Japan's policy. This is because the general public believes that after the treaty is abrogated, the ultimate result of any Japanese shipbuilding plan will inevitably be to Japan's disadvantage. A Tokyo dispatch states that the Japanese cabinet has approved the abrogation of the treaty, and the Privy Council will discuss it as soon as the army exercises are completed. Washington also pays little attention to this news. An American naval expert said, "Japan has the right to abrogate the treaty. If Japan thinks it should be abrogated, then let it be abrogated." The Associated Press later learned from reliable sources that the United States is very willing to abolish the existing treaty and replace it with a "gentleman's agreement," but Washington insists that the existing naval ratio must be maintained. Well-informed sources believe that the results of yesterday's congressional elections will make the U.S. attitude even stronger, as the leaders of the Republican Party who criticized the government's shipbuilding plan were not elected.

<p>Considering the Impact After Japan Announces Treaty Abrogation</p>
<p>Planning to Bypass Japan and Have Four Countries Sign a Treaty</p>
<p>[London] A Tokyo dispatch states that the U.S. naval delegation here is considering the possible impact after Japan announces the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty. The United States is now considering whether it can bypass Japan and have the other signatory countries (i.e., Britain, the United States, France, and Italy) extend the Washington Treaty. However, if this action is implemented, Japanese naval construction will not be subject to any restrictions. As a precaution, a guarantee clause should be added, stipulating that if Japan increases its navy above the existing ratio, then Britain, the United States, France, and Italy may also increase their tonnage proportionally. However, the ratio set by Washington must be maintained among the four countries. In other words, no matter how the tonnage increases, the navies of each country should still maintain the ratio of Britain 5, U.S. 5, Japan 3, and France and Italy 1.75 each. This plan is still in a purely non-public stage and has not been formally proposed. However, Britain still wants Japan to participate effectively when the new agreement is established, so it takes a reserved attitude towards the above-mentioned U.S. plan, fearing that Japan might regard it as an attempt by the Anglo-American united front and have a violent reaction.

<p>Japan to Make Suggestions</p>
<p>British Government Decides to Ignore</p>
<p>[London] The Associated Press learned from reliable sources today that if Japan wants to request Britain to reduce the armaments of the Singapore naval and air force base in the preliminary naval talks, Britain will refuse to consider it. Singapore is also known as the "Gibraltar of the East." The defense project cost a total of 14 million pounds, of which 11 million pounds have already been used. The entire armament plan is expected to be completed in 1938. The British government believes that Japan wants to weaken Singapore's military value, so Britain has decided to ignore it. The Singapore base has indeed become an invincible naval port in the world, but Tokyo has hinted that Japan will propose to weaken the Singapore naval base in the preliminary naval talks. This spring, the Japanese Hochi Shimbun reported that Japan intends to declare that Singapore not only threatens Japan but also hinders world peace, and its operational scope will expand to the opposite shore of the Indian Ocean, the China Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the South Pacific, shaking the balance of power between Britain, the United States, and Japan. Japan should demand that Britain withdraw from the Singapore naval port, etc. The British side has already made blatant expressions on this, so Japan will not rashly raise this issue.

<p>[London] Lord Jellicoe, an important spokesman for the Admiralty (former commander-in-chief of the British Navy during the European War), and naval expert Beil Wardell have successively published works, both advocating that the British Navy should be expanded immediately. Today, Labour Party Senator Lord Strabolgi (former naval officer, former commander of the warship HMS Hanworth) responded in the Labour Party's official newspaper, the Daily Herald, saying, "The real threat at sea is not the invasion and bombardment of warships, but the deadly chronic blockade. Blockades can be carried out by surface warships, submarines, or aircraft, or a combination of the three. All maritime countries fear blockades, especially island nations such as Britain and Japan. Britain is still the strongest naval power. If it can raise its voice and advocate freedom of the seas, it will surely gain the support of the United States, Italy, and even France. If so, Japan will not dare to hold dissenting views alone, otherwise Japan will be in a situation of isolation and helplessness. Since the Kellogg-Briand Pact has regarded war as illegal, the blockade of commercial navigation should also be regarded as illegal." (Eighth Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e76">Democratic Party Wins Big in Elections, Roosevelt's New Deal Gains Popular Support <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Congressional Obstruction Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>Foreign Policy Can Be Implemented Smoothly</p>
<p>[Washington] The "New Deal" won a great victory in yesterday's congressional elections. The Democratic Party has won a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, so President Roosevelt's power to control the national legislature has become stronger. It is generally believed that the Democratic Party's victory is President Roosevelt's personal victory, so it is believed that congressional resistance to the president has been completely eliminated. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull's power to control American foreign policy has been further strengthened, because in the future, treaties with other countries that need to be approved by the Senate, the Democratic Party has exceeded two-thirds, and it is no longer necessary to rely on Republican support to pass them. After the defeat of several Republican leaders, the main critics of restoring international trade by concluding reciprocal treaties with other countries have been greatly reduced, so today some people hope that the United States' trade policy will make great progress, and the president's "Good Neighbor" policy towards Latin American countries can also be consolidated. (Seventh National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[New York] According to the opinions of political observers, the Democratic Party's great victory in the congressional elections may not result in the government moving to the left. It is expected that President Roosevelt will continue to adopt his moderate policy. Some observers even believe that the Democratic Party's two-thirds majority in the Senate may not be helpful, but will be inflexible. Wall Street does not seem to be affected by the results of this election, as it is expected that there will not necessarily be a positive trend. Today, government bonds initially fell and then rebounded, while industrial stocks were stronger. New York City bonds fell by 75 due to Taylor's election as mayor. This is a noteworthy development. Voters in New Jersey have different opinions, electing Democrat Moore as senator, while also electing Republican Hoffman as governor. Of the 32 states that elected governors, Democrats were elected in 21 states, Republicans were elected in 6 states, and the other 5 states have not yet been announced, but the Democrats seem to have the upper hand. According to the latest statistics, the number of seats in the House of Representatives is as follows: Democratic Party 301, Republican Party 93, Progressive Party 7, Farmer-Labor Party 2, and 32 results unknown. The number of seats in the Senate is as follows: Democratic Party 68, Republican Party 23, Farmer-Labor Party 11, Progressive Party 6, Republican Party 23, Farmer-Labor Party 11, Progressive Party 1, and 2 results unknown. The governors of Michigan and New Jersey, which were originally Democrats, have now switched to the Republican Party, while Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and Wyoming, which were originally Republican strongholds, have now been won by the Democratic Party. Of the 32 states that elected governors, the Democratic Party still retained its governor status in 14 states. California's incumbent governor, Mulie Wood, ran for election as a Republican and was elected with 1,011,000 votes, while socialist writer Sinclair received only 748,000 votes. (Seventh Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[New York] In this election, President Roosevelt gained the people's trust, which has not been seen by previous presidents. According to custom, when the Republican Party is in power, it usually encounters small failures between two elections. Now that the Democratic Party is in power, the situation has changed. The victory achieved this time is extremely surprising, because the Democratic Party has not only not regressed, but has also occupied more than two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives, destroying the right wing of the Republican Party, the so-called "old guard," and excluding most of the Republican leaders in the Senate. Moreover, the Republican members of the two houses who were re-elected this time are all supporters of Roosevelt's New Deal. And Pennsylvania, which was originally the territory of the Mellon family of big industrialists, and the Republican Party in that state was its tool, now the governorship of that state has been won by the Democratic Party. Senator Little in that state was defeated, and was replaced by Democrat Kiefer. Therefore, Pennsylvania, which was originally occupied by the Republican Party, has been "conquered" by the Democratic Party and has become the party's biggest trophy. (Seventh Havas Telegraph)</p>

<p>Inspection Team Goes to Puppet Manchuria, Says There is Absolutely No Political Nature</p>
<p>U.S. and Britain Continue Negotiations with Japan on Oil Monopoly</p>
<p>[London] After the United States and Britain received Japan's reply to their protests regarding the "Manchukuo" oil monopoly, they are now eagerly awaiting the development of this matter. A Reuters reporter in Washington today visited Deputy Secretary of State Phillips. Phillips did not want to comment on the content of the Japanese reply, but said that the U.S. government now intends to continue exchanging diplomatic documents with Tokyo on this matter. Judging from British Foreign Secretary Simon's remarks in the House of Commons today, Britain also wants to deal with this matter in this way. In the House of Commons today, a member asked the Foreign Secretary whether he could declare that the Japanese government is still complying with the principle of the Open Door in Manchuria, and whether this principle will be broken by the oil monopoly. The Foreign Secretary replied that the British government has notified the authorities in Manchuria and the Japanese government of its views on the oil monopoly, and has not yet received a reply, so he does not want to issue a resolution on this matter at present. The Foreign Secretary also replied to another question, saying that he could not inform the actions of other governments on this matter. (Seventh Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[London] Lord Cecil asked about the British inspection team's trip to Manchuria in the House of Lords today. Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Stanhope replied that the inspection team was purely commercial in nature and did not have the right to speak on behalf of the British government on any issue. The chairman of the inspection team had a letter published in the Morning Post on August 24, which can be checked. Britain has taken the opportunity to explain to the Japanese government that the inspection team is non-political and non-official. The House of Commons also discussed this matter today. Foreign Secretary Simon replied to an official's questions, saying that since the inspection team is strictly commercial and non-political in nature, the British government's agreement to the inspection team does not raise any questions. The British government's attitude towards the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo" still complies with the principles in the previous case passed by the League of Nations General Assembly on February 24, 1933. Conservative Party Hanning asked whether the inspection team's work was very beneficial to British trade. Simon replied, "Yes, but commerce and politics can be kept separate." Seligman, a member of the British industrial inspection team and manager of Seligman Brothers Bank of Britain, is on his way back to Britain and said today in Vancouver that Anglo-Japanese goodwill has been strengthened by the inspection team's travels. He believes that the inspection team has achieved its purpose. The members never mentioned politics during their travels. Their main purpose was to consolidate Anglo-Japanese friendship and promote trade. The leader of the inspection team, Barnesby, is in Honolulu and will return to London via San Francisco.

<h3 id="e80">Dumergue Cabinet Overthrown After Only Nine Months in Power <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Constitutional Reform Bill Was the Fatal Blow</p>
<p>Flandin Ordered to Form a New Cabinet</p>
<p>National Sentiment is Volatile; Paris is Under Strict Guard</p>
<p>[Paris] The Dumergue cabinet has recently resigned in its entirety. The reason is that Prime Minister Dumergue's proposed constitutional reform bill and the 1935 provisional budget bill were met with disagreement from the cabinet members of the Radical Socialist Party, and all the parties of the extreme left in the House of Representatives and the Radical Socialist Party also expressed their opposition. Therefore, the "Party Truce" cabinet, which was established on February 9 of this year, was inevitably disintegrated. (Eighth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Dumergue government, which had been in power for a full nine months, resigned today, which will once again set off a political storm in France. Dumergue had no choice but to step down because five cabinet members of the Radical Socialist Party refused to withdraw their resignation letters. After President Lebrun accepted the cabinet's resignation, he immediately invited Laval, the leader of the right-center party, to form a new cabinet. Laval declined, so the president invited Flandin, a member of the right-center party and the current Minister of Public Works, to form a cabinet. Flandin accepted this task, and the president was relieved.</p>
<p>After a cabinet meeting this morning, Cabinet Minister Herriot, without portfolio, gave a typewritten copy of his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, along with the resignation letters of the Radical Party cabinet members, to a group of French journalists and foreign reporters waiting. The letter, four pages long, was signed by Herriot and Minister of Education Bertod, Minister of Aviation Perrin, and Minister of Agriculture Quilles. Minister of Commerce Laimolo and Mahchando were not named due to illness. The letter stated that the Radical Socialist cabinet members strictly adhered to the contract of party truce made when they joined the cabinet, but Prime Minister Dumergue recently wanted to implement various major political reforms without consulting them first, causing them to no longer be able to respect the conditions in the contract.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the Prime Minister consulted with other cabinet members and drafted a letter to the President, which severely criticized the selfishness of the Radical Socialist Party, and said that if the demands of the political group holding full power on February 6 (when riots broke out in Paris, causing the Daladier government to collapse and the Dumergue government to take over) were to be succumbed to, then the "truce" could no longer exist, and the government's decisions would all follow the party's pleasures, which was not possible.</p>
<p>Dumergue was warmly cheered by the public when he left the presidential palace for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and returned to the Prime Minister's Office today. He then left the palace with his wife. Dumergue issued a warning to the nation, saying, "I have been forced to resign. I now urge all citizens to remain calm and self-possessed, as this is necessary in order to find the best way to escape today's difficulties and for the sake of the country's interests."</p>
<p>Dumergue told reporters that some people in Congress were planning to overthrow the cabinet by taking advantage of the country's current financial insufficiency.</p>
<p>The new Prime Minister Flandin has held various important positions in the government since the European War, but this is the first time he has served as Prime Minister. (Eighth Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Paris] At the same time, national sentiment is very volatile. Yesterday, the Prime Minister was not noticed when he left the House of Representatives, which has aroused general comments. The authorities are now afraid that the riots in Paris on February 6 will be repeated, so they have stepped up security. The number of police on the streets has tripled, and the Grand Conservatory of Music has been converted into a temporary headquarters for the police. (Seventh Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Paris] The streets of Paris are now on alert, fearing a reaction after the Dumergue cabinet is overthrown. There are now car guards stationed in the Luxembourg Palace, and police are also stationed in the Senate and the surrounding streets. (Eighth Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Paris] At the State Council meeting this morning, four cabinet members of the Radical Socialist Party (Cabinet Minister Herriot without portfolio, Minister of Education Bertod, Minister of Merchant Marine Pedron, and Minister of Agriculture Gueille) formally submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Dumergue. At 11:30 a.m., after the four resigning cabinet members of the Radical Socialist Party left the meeting, Prime Minister Dumergue and his colleagues drafted the cabinet's resignation letter. Thus, the Party Truce cabinet was overthrown. As for the letter from the cabinet members of the Radical Socialist Party to Prime Minister Dumergue, it first praised Dumergue's achievements, and then said that the nature of the constitutional reform bill proposed by the Prime Minister exceeded the scope of the Party Truce contract. In order to be loyal to their principles and obligations, they had to submit their resignations. A communiqué was issued when the State Council meeting closed, stating that the cabinet members of the Radical Socialist Party could not agree on the provisional budget bill and submitted their resignations, so the cabinet submitted its resignation in its entirety.</p>
<p>The Dumergue cabinet was established on February 9 of this year, when the Daladier cabinet was overthrown due to bloody riots in Paris. Lebrun then ordered former President Dumergue to unite all parties except the extreme left to form a Party Truce cabinet. For nine months, the Dumergue cabinet rectified finances, reformed taxation, reduced government spending, and clarified the judiciary. The budget was balanced and the political situation gradually stabilized. Recently, Prime Minister Dumergue wanted to thoroughly rectify domestic affairs and enhance administrative power, so he advocated reforming the constitution. The constitutional reform bill had four main points: first, to enhance the administrative power neglected in the constitution; second, when a conflict occurs between the government and the two houses, if the House of Representatives has been elected for a full year, but with the consent of the President and the Prime Minister, it can be dissolved without the approval of the Senate; third, to ensure the service of legislative personnel, such as civil servants who disobey government actions, they may be dismissed. This constitutional reform bill was discussed at the Radical Socialist Party Congress in Lanté and passed a resolution, expressing support for enhancing administrative power, but opposing the dissolution of the parliament without the consent of the Senate. However, the Congress still granted the Radical Party cabinet members the right to freely express their views. Therefore, after the parliament reopened yesterday, Prime Minister Dumergue could have immediately submitted the constitutional reform bill, but amending the constitution requires a constitutional conference formed by the merger of the two houses for discussion. After the constitution is amended, dissolving the parliament and re-electing it will take a considerable amount of time. The next year's budget is approaching in the blink of an eye, and it is difficult to delay for a long time. Therefore, Prime Minister Dumergue planned to submit a provisional budget bill for January, February, and March of next year to the parliament, requesting its passage, and then continue to discuss the constitutional reform bill. However, the cabinet members of the Radical Socialist Party, in accordance with the resolution of the Lanté Congress, opposed the constitutional reform bill, so they could not agree on the submission of the provisional budget bill. Since the opinions of both sides were incompatible, the four cabinet members of the Radical Party submitted their resignations this morning. At this point, it was impossible for Prime Minister Dumergue to form a minority cabinet, and Dumergue had already stated yesterday that he did not want to request the Senate's consent to dissolve the parliament, because otherwise, public opinion would accuse him of intending to be a dictator. Therefore, Prime Minister Dumergue decided not to attend the House of Representatives this afternoon, and the cabinet submitted its resignation in its entirety to President Lebrun. (Eighth Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Paris] All efforts to avoid a cabinet crisis have now failed. Prime Minister Dumergue has also decided to step down. The most important question now is the maintenance of the "Party Truce." Since it is required by most newspapers, and the consolidation of public administration must continue, who is most suitable to take on this important task? This is what the general public urgently wants to know. Excisive News said, "Foreign countries are now watching us. Do not let them feel that we have divergent opinions on domestic affairs, because there are many people who take advantage of our infighting to find flaws. For the sake of the present, it is appropriate to show a calm attitude to the outside world. This is the highest obligation of the country and each individual." The Morning Post wrote, "From tonight onwards, a new all-party truce national unity cabinet should be formed again, so that those who spy on the country from abroad can distinguish the true face of France, and those who want to take advantage of the weaknesses of our country will all return in despair."

<p>[Berlin] Regarding the Franco-German communiqué issued in Paris, it is believed here that there is no prospect of clarification on the Saar issue. Although French Foreign Minister Laval denied French press reports that the French government was preparing to invade the Saar region, this is a point that the German side may find somewhat satisfactory. However, on the other hand, the French Foreign Minister still insists that the French government has the legal and moral right to send troops into the Saar to maintain order and ensure the freedom of voters during the plebiscite. Therefore, German Ambassador Köster had no choice but to point out that this view is clearly unacceptable to Germany. However, the exchange of views may continue. In addition to the German ambassador to France, German representatives in London, Rome, and Brussels have also received instructions from their government to protest at any time against the entry of French troops into the Saar, as Germany considers any such action to be unjustifiable under any circumstances. (Seventh National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Paris] The current Franco-German talks, namely the discussions between French Foreign Minister Laval and German Ambassador Köster, are being given great importance by the French public. According to general public opinion, this meeting has been able to clarify the views of France and Germany on the Saar issue and will enable the Saar plebiscite to be completed without hindrance. Le Petit Journal stated that this meeting is a major step forward in easing the current situation and that neither France nor Germany wants to disrupt the vote. Le Petit Parisien stated that this conversation is the first direct exchange of views between France and Germany on the difficult issue of the Saar, and its significance can be measured from this point. La Victoire believes that the communiqué issued today is a tacit understanding between France and Germany, and that both sides are willing to bring the Saar issue to a swift conclusion.

<p>Merger of Togoland with French Territory Rejected</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Mandates Commission debated fiercely on France's request to merge the former German territory of Togoland with the French territory of Dahomey. Togoland is suffering greatly from the global economic depression, with an annual loss of four million francs. The chairman of the commission stated that since the commission had previously rejected the merger of a German territory with the Union of South Africa, it cannot now grant France's request. France should still find ways to make up for the financial shortfall. (Eighth National Telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e89">Under the Control of the Japanese Army, Sham Organizations Change Military Systems and Intensify Training <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Eliminating Complex Elements for Utilization</p>
<p>Establishing Horse Breeding Farms to Increase Military Horses</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Japanese army, considering that the elements within the puppet army are complex and that without strict elimination and special training, they are insufficient for the Japanese army to drive, has since changing the military district, implemented the recruitment of new soldiers and the establishment of a new army. As for the reconstruction of military camps and the establishment of military horse breeding farms, they are all very active. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for Recruiting New Soldiers: The Japanese ordered the puppet organization to change the military system, break the traditional private system, to prevent taking the opportunity to revolt. Since its implementation, the puppet army's senior military officers have been transferred separately. Now, in the name of refreshing the army, the old and incompetent elements are eliminated, and strong men are recruited. Regulations are formulated, and a semi-conscription system is tested. The Bao head, district head, and county head provide guarantees at each level, and those who have real estate, are between the ages of 18 and 25, are roughly literate, and are physically fit are qualified. The term of enlistment is temporarily set at two years. The Puppet First Military District Command has begun recruiting, with a total of seven locations in Fengcheng, Dihua, Linjiang, Yingkou, Shanchengzi, and Shenyang.</p>
<p>Puppet Review and Autumn Maneuvers: After the puppet military system was changed, all the puppet troops were nominally supervised by Puyi himself, and a large-scale autumn exercise was held. The exercise took place from October 13 for three days in Changchun, with the location being from Datun to Nanling. The soldiers were divided into the North and South armies. The North Army was the puppet "Fengtian Jing'an Army", and the South Army was troops drawn from Jilin and Heilongjiang. Each army had 2,500 men, with artillery covering infantry and cavalry combat. On the 15th, Puyi personally inspected the troops and held a military parade, with Yu Zhishan as the commander. In addition, the Puppet Ministry of Military Affairs, having changed the military system, and in order to boost the spirit of the army, summoned the commanders of 77 regiments of infantry and cavalry and gathered them at the Puppet Palace in Changchun on the anniversary of Japan's recognition of the puppet state of Manchuria (September 15). Puyi personally presented the military flags, granting each regiment a military flag, including infantry regiments 1 to 26, 33 to 35, cavalry regiments 4 to 32, 39 to 44, training infantry regiments 4 and 5, training cavalry regiments 4 and 5, and puppet Jing'an cavalry regiments 1 to 8, totaling 77 regiments.</p>
<p>Building Military Camps at the Dafosi Temple: The Puppet Ministry of Military Affairs previously designated the Dafosi Temple in Chengde City to be renovated into a military camp. The Yuji Construction Company has contracted for the renovation, and the work has been accelerated since construction began. It has now been completed and can accommodate more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Establishing Military Horse Breeding Farms: In order to improve and increase horses, the Puppet Ministry of Military Affairs established the puppet "National Horse Breeding Farm." In August, the official system of the puppet National Horse Breeding Farm was announced, and preparations were actively made. It is reported that it has been decided to establish two farms first: (1) the Hailar National Horse Breeding Farm, with jurisdiction over the Puppet Xing'an North Province and specific designated areas; (2) the Taonan National Horse Breeding Farm, with jurisdiction over Taonan, Anguang, Zhendong, Tuquan, Zhanyu, Kaitong, and other counties, as well as the Puppet Xing'an South Province and specific designated areas.

<h3 id="e90">Rampant Banditry in Yutian <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Rob in Broad Daylight in the City</p>
<p>Neighboring Counties Blockade to Prevent Bandits from Fleeing</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Banditry in various parts of eastern Luan has recently been most severe in Yutian. Just a dozen or so miles from the city, there are large and small groups of dozens to hundreds of bandits entrenched, looting in all directions during the day. The militia and police teams are overwhelmed with prevention and suppression. On the 3rd of this month, the Wang residence in Yutian South Gate was broken into by a gang of about 20 bandits in broad daylight and looted empty. Then they went to the adjacent Ye residence and looted countless valuables as well. The whole process lasted two hours. The security team of the war zone stationed in the city turned a blind eye and allowed them to plunder and flee far away. As a result, the upper classes of the city have moved away one after another to avoid banditry. The major towns of Yahong Bridge and Wangxiezhuang in Hongqiao Town outside the city have been looted dozens of times. The markets are deserted, and gatherings have stopped. Merchants have also transported bulky goods elsewhere. Wangxiezhuang was occupied by more than 200 bandits on the 4th of this month. The Yutian County Militia has been dispatched to suppress them. Zunhua, being adjacent to the county, has a duty to assist and has also sent police and militia to assist in the suppression. The militias of Zunhua, Qian'an, Fengrun, and Jixian, because of the large number of bandits in Yutian, are guarding against their intrusion and are all blocking the borders. In particular, Zunhua is facing enemies on both sides and must both guard against the bandits from Yanshankou outside the Great Wall and also consider the invasion of bandit gangs from Yutian. The militia is insufficient for deployment and defense. In order to defend themselves, the farmers have formed joint village associations. The 68 villages in the Mizi Camp in the Third District took the lead in forming an association a few days ago, gathering more than 500 village guards, with Wang Jizong as the commander for training. The weapons are all self-provided by the people. Other districts will also follow suit. It is said that the bandits in Yutian can be divided into three categories. The first category is purely bandits who are forced to make a living and seek to solve their current problems, accounting for about three tenths of the bandits in Yutian. The second category is the plainclothes teams of Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan, who have backgrounds, are between soldiers and bandits, and use saving the country as a slogan to carry out their robbery, accounting for about five tenths. The third category belongs to the Security Supplementary Team in the war zone. The team has not listened to the provincial order to reorganize from beginning to end, relying on Yutian being within the war zone, and the province cannot take decisive measures, so the relationship with Shi Yousan is still maintained. The team soldiers are in contact with the plainclothes teams. They are soldiers during the day and change into plain clothes to become bandits at night. Because guns and bullets are readily available, it is very easy to carry out robbery. This accounts for about two tenths of the total number of bandits in Yutian. Yutian is disturbed by these three categories of bandits, and the local area is unsettled, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted. Ba County is the hardest hit. Because the police and militia teams of Fengrun, Jixian, Zunhua, and Qian'an are still quite strong, and the border areas are strictly guarded, the bandits cannot cross over. The strength of the Ba County regiment police is weak, and because the Jiyun Canal in the county has overflowed after the water rose, and has not fallen until now, four districts of the county are a vast expanse of water, making transportation inconvenient. The bandits take advantage of the boats to intercept and rob. County Magistrate Zhao of Ba County has been planning to expand the police regiment and install long-distance telephone projects, preparing to clear the bandits in the territory during the winter defense period. In addition to the semi-official bandits in Yutian, who must wait for the War Zone Clearance Committee to be responsible for handling them, the newly appointed County Magistrate Huang Zhongkai is planning to gather the police regiment and increase the suppression of the pure bandits.

<h3 id="e91">Guangdong Province's Budget for the 23rd Year <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Income Does Not Cover Expenditures by More Than 26 Million</p>
<p>Changing Grain Tax to Land Tax to Be Implemented Soon</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province's finances have recently been burdened by heavy expenditures, and the budget for the 23rd year is in a situation where income does not cover expenditures. The authorities ordered the provincial government to order all agencies that, in the future, all directly productive agencies should continue to spend as before, but indirectly productive agencies should strive to reduce and conserve. According to the report on the total amount of income and expenditures for the 23rd year made by the Financial Commissioner's Office, the total budgeted income part of the year is 43,446,204.40 yuan. According to the 70% standard of the income in the 22nd year, the actual income is 31,715,729.22 yuan. The expenditure part is statistically 58,400,347.12 yuan. The income and expenditures do not cover 26,687,617.91 yuan. According to the authorities, in terms of donations and taxes, more than 80 kinds of harsh and miscellaneous taxes and donations were abolished before August 1 this year, resulting in a reduction of more than 4.7 million yuan per year. It is planned to abolish more than 40 kinds next year, resulting in a reduction of more than 1.6 million yuan per year. A total of more than 120 kinds have been abolished or scheduled to be abolished, resulting in a reduction of more than 6.4 million yuan per year. As for the item of increasing revenue, the change from grain tax to land tax throughout the province is being actively carried out. The investigation of farmland in each county will be completed one after another. The change to land tax can be implemented in the short term. In terms of the provincial treasury, the previous allocation of grain tax in each county was "80% allocated to the provincial treasury, 20% retained in the county" as local political expenses. If the land tax is changed, 50% can be allocated and 50% retained, and the government revenue will increase instead. This is because there is no bad habit of cheating on grain tax. In the past, the income from grain tax was only 60% to 70%. The accumulated abuses included "land without tax" and "tax without land". After changing to land tax, there will be no such abuses. The income of the local government in the county will also be relatively abundant. In the past, 20% of the grain tax was retained in the county, but now it is 50%. If so, the county's political expenses will increase, and the construction, education, and security expenses at the local level will not be as stretched as before. (November 3)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Records of a Northwestern Inspection <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>The Scenery of Anxi County</p>
<p>In the Spring and Autumn period, Anxi was the land of the Western Rong. The Yuezhi Rong of Qin resided there. During the Han dynasty, it was part of the Dunhuang Commandery, governing six counties, and was one of the four commanderies of the Hexi Corridor. The city was built in the sixth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty. It has a circumference of six li and seven fen, with open spaces at the four corners. Only around the Drum Tower and the east and west streets is there a concentration of population, occupying about one-sixth of the city's area. The desolate situation can be imagined. The county extends 580 li from east to west and over 500 li from north to south. This only refers to the more populated areas. If the vast, deserted lands to the north and south are included, the total area of the county exceeds ten thousand square li. It is 360 li northwest to Xingxing Gorge on the border of Hami, and extending to Hami, it is 880 li, all of which is Gobi desert. It is 250 li southeast to the Sandaogou on the border of Yumen. There are many ditches. Extending further to Lanzhou, it is 2,160 li, and to Nanjing, it is several thousand li. It is 130 li west to Shuang Dunzi, west of Luchao Gou on the border of Dunhuang, near the fields, which are prone to flooding. The facilities at each post station, during the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, included six horses per station and three grooms. Each horse was provided with 8.5 fen of silver for fodder daily, and each groom received one tael of silver per month for wages and five dou of grain. In the early Republic, the old stations were abolished and replaced with postal services. For Gobi stations where postal routes were not established, laborers were still hired to guard the wells and springs, receiving two or three dou of wheat per month.</p>
<p>The geology consists of the Mazong Mountain in the north and the Qilian Mountain in the south, both of which are igneous rock. In between lies a plain, cultivated for farmland. The land in Wuying and the various trenches, namely Nanbei Gong, Tashi, and the Third, Fourth, and Fifth trenches (all of which are village names), is loamy soil. Qiaozi, Bulongji, Dongbatou, etc., all have alkaline soil, and the rest is Gobi Desert. Fortunately, the water table is not very deep. The climate has a coldest period of about 90 days per year and a hottest period of 50 days. Rainfall is minimal, and winter snow and autumn dew are rare (the snow on the southern mountains never melts). The summer sun is scorching, and the winter is severely cold. In the spring and winter, there are particularly violent winds, with sand and gravel flying, darkening the sky and lasting for days. They uproot trees and destroy houses, causing great harm. In the past, the winds of Anxi, the cold of Zhenxi, and the heat of Turpan were known as the "Three Absolutes."</p>
<p>The Southern Mountain is fifty li south of the city, starting from Shuangtabao, called Luanshanzi, and extending west to Guazhou Kou, called Jieshanzi. It is mostly dark green and black stone, without water, and no grass or trees grow. There are occasional coal mines. West to Dunhuang, it turns into quicksand. This mountain stretches across the county for about 200 li, with peaks only a hundred feet high. The Snow Mountain is three hundred li south of the county, which is the Qilian Peak, over eight thousand feet high. The mountains are covered in snow, which melts slightly in the spring and summer, providing water for cultivation. It is rich in various metals and sulfur, but it is occupied by the Qing Fan (a term for local ethnic groups) and has never been mined. The Salt Lake is eighty li south of the city. Natural salt blocks can be dug freely. Transported to the city, they sell for only one or two copper coins per catty. Pu Cheng Mountain is 580 li north of the county and is rich in lead and silver deposits. It was mined in the past but was abandoned due to unrest. Da Qingshan produces Cistanche deserticola and Cynomorium songaricum. Licorice is everywhere. Locals cut the branches for firewood, and the thick roots, as thick as a fist, are used for medicine. Other products such as rhubarb, Lycium chinense, and Ephedra sinica are also abundant. The animal and livestock resources are complete. Wild animals include gazelles, wild foxes, badgers, wild rabbits, jackals, leopards, lynx, wild horses, deer, musk deer, etc. Apart from rice, all crops are grown. Melons and fruits come from Dunhuang.</p>
<p>One hundred and sixty li south of the city is the Yulin Grottoes. Springs come from both mountains and never dry up in all four seasons. Tall trees and abundant grass cover about forty or fifty li. Inside there is a large Buddha statue, sixteen zhang tall, with golden colors shining brightly, magnificent and solemn. The other Buddha caves also have many statues, said to be from the Western Xia Dynasty, later renovated by the Tang and Yuan dynasties. Also in this mountain is an ivory Buddha statue, the size of a palm, two pieces joined together, with a Manjushri Buddha image carved on the outside and countless small Buddhas carved on the inside, exquisite and intricate, resembling Indian carvings. It is undoubtedly an offering from a Tibetan monk of the Tang Dynasty. It is said that this Buddha is a sacred object to suppress the land and ensure peace. During the Tongzhi Rebellion, it flew away without wings, and the mountain spring suddenly dried up. Later, two or three thousand taels of silver were spent until the Guangxu period to find and return the original object. The spring water then flowed again, which can be called the ultimate in mythological ability. This Buddha is now treasured in rotation by local gentry. If one wants to borrow it, the city gentry entrust it to the village gentry, and the village gentry push it back to the city gentry. Therefore, the previous Northwestern Scientific Expedition and all past county magistrates wanted to feast their eyes on it but failed to do so. If this object is as precious and rare as described above, it should be properly preserved to avoid the fate of the ancient scriptures of Dunhuang, which were stolen by foreigners.</p>
<p>As for the ancient relics in the city, the first is a deep spring under the Drum Tower. Legend has it that "the spring is very strong, secretly connected to the Sule River north of the city. In the past, a geomancer said that Anxi would produce an official who would be rebellious and unfavorable to the border. If this spring were blocked, its feng shui could be broken." Later, it was covered with seven pots, and four wells were dug in four directions three or four zhang away to divert its source. Since then, although the spring still gushes out, its power has been greatly reduced. The deep spring is made into a well with stone, about ten feet deep. A wooden railing surrounds the well, three feet square at the bottom and about five feet high, with a door opening to the north for drawing water. A pillar stands on the railing, piercing the center of the Drum Tower's bottom surface, with two dragons coiling on it, opening their mouths and waving their claws, as if trying to enter the well. In addition, the two wells in the northeast have been filled in, and the two wells in the southwest are still used for drinking. However, residents compete to draw water from the deep spring for boiling opium, as it is said to filter the impurities and have a clear fragrance. The Drum Tower is over two zhang high and forty steps square, with eight-step-wide arches. There is a well in the center, and vegetable stalls are set up in the four arches, which hinders traffic and the view. The upper pavilion has long collapsed. South of the tower, leaning against the wall, is a Mingchi Building, as tall as the Drum Tower. Although it bears the sign of the Education Hall, it has been rented out as a shop. The current county magistrate, Xie Dousheng, upon taking office, seeing that the deep spring and the Drum Tower are the only historical sites in Anxi, plans to move the Mingchi Building to the top of the Drum Tower, add some repairs, and convert it into a public education hall. However, local funds are scarce, and implementation remains to be seen.</p>
<p>There is a river to the north of the city and a canal to the south. Digging five feet deep reveals a water source. The soil is fertile and suitable for cultivation. Willows and elaeagnus angustifolia are lush and verdant, stretching for dozens of li. Looking out from a height, one feels especially pleased. About five li south of the city, there is an ancient fortress, thought to have been a military camp that was abandoned. The north and south walls of the fortress have not collapsed much. The east and west sides have been blown by strong winds and are fragmented, resembling city battlements, and some are almost submerged by quicksand. Also, the south gate of Anxi and the inner walls of the east city are now blocked by quicksand. The east-west winds in Anxi are stronger than the north-south winds. When they come, they always carry fine sand. When they encounter city buildings, trees, or forests, they are slightly hindered, and the sand falls down, accumulating like sand dunes. It is said that the old barrier wall outside the east gate was once lively with residents but was buried by quicksand due to the lack of trees. Therefore, to reduce the disaster of wind and sand, planting forests extensively is essential. The water table in Anxi is shallow and abundant, making it easy to grow trees. For fields lacking canal water, wells can be dug for irrigation (various counties in Shandong benefit greatly from using well water to irrigate the fields). Local people, please do not neglect this.</p>

<p>Land Bureau to be Established on a Fixed Date</p>
<p>Our county previously received provincial orders to actively carry out land survey work, and the county magistrate was appointed as the preparatory member of the Land Bureau, to first engage in household land surveying. Later, the county magistrate resigned from his concurrent position, and Zhu Tongqi was appointed as the preparatory member in his place, with the office attached to the county government. Preparations have been completed, and it is scheduled to be officially established on the 11th of this month, with the bureau located at the First Building. The provincial government appointed Zhu, the preparatory member, as the director of the bureau. It is heard that the bureau will be divided into three sections, with a technical officer and employees also appointed. As for the internal staff, except for the head of the First Section, who will be concurrently held by the director, and the head of the Second Section, who will be concurrently held by the head of the land survey team, the rest have been largely decided internally.</p>
<p>Water Patrol Team Captures Suspected Thieves</p>
<p>The home of Zhong Yuping, located at Taipailou in our city, was suddenly broken into by four robbers carrying submachine guns and bayonets on the evening of the previous day. They gained entry by pretending to deliver a gift, tied up the victim, imprisoned him in a room, and stole over three hundred yuan in foreign currency, as well as gold jewelry and antiques. That night, special agents and security teams from the Public Security Bureau intercepted them from all sides but did not find them overnight. This case has attracted much attention from the military and police. The Water Patrol Team discovered a man named Qi Jingen (nickname Ata) behaving improperly at Jiangjing Bridge in our city, suspected him of being involved, and arrested him. The team investigated him. It is heard that Qi Jingen denies any involvement in the Zhong surname robbery and has permission to seek bail.</p>

<p>Disaster-Stricken Farmers Report Crop Failure to the County</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, Kunshan County has been plagued by drought. After surveying by the heads of various districts and townships, the total area of ​​disaster-stricken fields with no harvest is 111,708 mu. After the county reported the crop failure to the province, the county government was ordered to reject it and even increase taxes. Although various local public groups wired the province to argue for relief, there was no solution. At 10:00 AM on the 8th, over three thousand disaster-stricken farmers gathered at the East Gate and Da Xi Men, holding rice crops with no grains, and reported the crop failure to the county government, demanding the removal of disaster-stricken fields. County Magistrate Peng went to welcome Chairman Lin at the time. Section Chief Mei came out to comfort them with kind words and promised to report to higher authorities. The villagers then dispersed.</p>

<p>Employee of Bank of China Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Xu Zhenxia, ​​an employee of the Bank of China in our county, a 29-year-old from Suzhou, was the beloved son-in-law of the bank's director, Wu Zhihe. Xu's father, Weigan, was the director of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank in Hankou, and his uncle, Weizhen, was the director of the China Bank office in Changzhou. He had two younger brothers, Kuangxia and Qixia, who worked in the Bank of China in Suzhou and Shanghai, respectively. Zhenxia loved Peking opera and was skilled in writing. He was also a special contributor to the Shanghai Saturday Weekly, the Coral Magazine edited by Fan Yanqiao, and the Mingjing supplement of the Suzhou Ming Bao, under the pen names Juanhun and Juanyun. Seven years ago, Zhenxia's wife (Wu Zhihe's eldest daughter) passed away due to childbirth, and Zhenxia was always depressed. During his spare time after work, he would often go to the director's office to chat with his father-in-law, vaguely revealing his intention to marry his wife's younger sister. Wu's second daughter, Jin Hui, who is currently studying at Shanghai Tongde Medical School, is 29 years old and has both talent and beauty. However, Wu sternly refused. Zhenxia was disappointed that his request was hopeless, and his depression worsened. The night before, Xu was talking and laughing with his colleagues as usual, showing no signs of anything unusual. Unexpectedly, after returning to his dormitory to sleep, he had not arrived at the office by about 9:00 AM the next morning. The office staff went upstairs to wake him up and found the doors tightly closed. They knocked but received no response. When they peeked through the crack, they saw Zhenxia's neck tied with a trouser belt, cushioned with a towel, hanging himself by the door. They immediately reported to the director and broke down the door to enter and untie him, using artificial respiration to resuscitate him, but to no avail. They then requested Chinese and Western doctors such as Zhou Lun and Xu Songquan to provide emergency treatment, but it was too late to revive him. Director Wu has urgently telegraphed his family members to come to Wuxi to handle the funeral arrangements. However, the bank has kept it a secret from the outside world. The police investigation has also found no clues.</p>
<p>Agricultural Warehouse Rice Mortgage Measures</p>
<p>For the purpose of rescuing farmers and regulating rural finance, Wuxi Farmers Bank is planning to establish rural warehouses and agricultural product transportation offices, and the provincial bank has appointed Zou Hanxiang as the director of the Wuxi Transportation Office. In view of the severe drought this year, the Yangtze River Basin, known as the richest rice-producing area in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces, has suffered poor harvests, and there are even discussions about restricting exports. Even in Wuxi, the harvest is at most less than 60% of last year's. The lack of food next year is already foreseeable. Yesterday, the Agricultural Warehouse Committee was convened to discuss remedial measures, deciding to jointly establish 22 agricultural warehouses in the four rural areas with the Farmers Bank and the pawnshop trade association and passing the following measures: (1) Farmers Bank will operate warehouses independently at Dongting, Qianqiao, and Anzhen; (2) Each pawnshop acts as an agent of the agricultural warehouse at these locations: Qingming Bridge Shangtang, Youxiatang, Zhouxin Town, Nanqiao, Yanqiao, Changan Bridge, Bashi Bridge, Zhangjing Bridge, Yanjia Bridge, Meicun, Dangkou, Houzhai Town, Huadafang Village, Yuqi Town, Qianzhou, Yangshuyuan, Fengzhuang, Hudai, Yangjian Town, and 19 pawnshops; (3) The monthly interest on the loan is 1.5%, and the pawnshop agent charges 1.6%; (4) Each household must mortgage at least 5 dou and at most 10 shi of rice; (5) The mortgaged rice is calculated at 70% of the market price; (6) All warehouse mortgages start from December 1st. Also, the rice trade association, fearing that the Farmers Bank's operation of warehouses and transportation offices would affect the industry, declared its opposition. The Chamber of Commerce has been mediating. Yesterday (the 8th), the Chamber of Commerce convened the Farmers Bank and rice bean industry in the afternoon to negotiate. Both sides have thoroughly understood each other, and the rice industry has also agreed to improve its business policies to converge.</p>

<p>Relief Representatives from Jin Province Return to Changzhou</p>
<p>Wujin County suffered a severe drought this year. The provincial government previously allocated 20,000 yuan for drought relief, but the county government planned to use 120,000 yuan for dredging rivers with relief work. In addition to raising half of the amount locally, the provincial government must allocate at least 40,000 yuan or more, otherwise, it will not be enough to allocate. Shi Ziquan, the third section chief of the county government, previously went to Jin Province to fight for relief, but there were no results. Fellow villagers of Wujin living in Beijing held a meeting to discuss. In addition to Wu Zhihui writing to the chairman in his private capacity, requesting an increase in relief funds, they also appointed representatives Cheng Cangbo, Yang Bingquan, and Wu Jingyu to arrive in Zhen on the 5th. Wujin also appointed representatives Gao Bozhen, Chen Dayou, and Wu Jingyuan to arrive in Zhen on the same day. They went to the provincial government together on the morning of the 6th. The provincial government committee meeting had just ended. Chairman Chen received them. Zhao, the Director of the Finance Department, Yu, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Shen, the Director of the Construction Department, were also present. Each representative stated three points: 1. Please allocate relief funds. Chairman Chen replied that it was difficult to increase the overall budget. 2. Autumn survey issue: Please exempt the grain tax on fields with no harvest and implement a general reduction for the rest. Director Zhao of the Finance Department expressed his acceptance. 3. Please return the 35,000 yuan of Wujin governance public bonds borrowed from various counties in Jiangbei to be used for relief work. Director Shen of the Construction Department said that the money owed by various counties in Jiangbei has only been collected by 10%, so it is impossible to allocate it at this time, so nothing was obtained. Each representative then returned to Changzhou, and the representatives living in Beijing returned to Beijing. It is heard that the issue of relief work still needs to be discussed further.</p>

<p>The county government previously found that the prison was dilapidated, making defense unreliable, and the overcrowding made hygiene non-compliant. Therefore, it submitted an application to the High Court to raise funds and build a new prison. The work has been underway for two months. Now, all the projects have been completed and are in compliance with the original regulations.

<p>Bandits Kidnap and Injure People in Western Suburbs</p>
<p>The home of Jiang Fengting, a farmer from the Xujiaxiang village in the second township of Yishu, Yangzhou County, was suddenly broken into by many bandits armed with guns the night before. They forbade them from making a sound and immediately searched and looted clothes. Jiang's abdomen was shot by a bandit and he fell to the ground unconscious. When the bandits left, they kidnapped Jiang Fengting's ten-year-old child. At Yingwankou, the child suddenly cried for help, which was discovered by the villagers, who gathered a crowd, rescued the child, and captured a bandit named Li Xian'gen. The remaining bandits escaped. The villagers sent the bandit and the hostage to the Xupuqiao Security Detachment in Yishu, and the team then captured a suspect named Cao Yuanju in Yuetangji. As for Jiang Fengting, the injured victim, he died on the 6th due to his serious injuries.</p>
<p>Murderer of Adulterer Surrenders Himself</p>
<p>Wang Juchang, the manager of the Shuangguiquan bathhouse in Touxiang in our city, found his wife, Wu, sleeping with Chen Juyuan, a worker in the shop, and killed him with an axe. Afterwards, Wang fled to evade punishment. Zhu, the prosecutor of the Jiangdu Court Prosecutor's Office, verified the facts and issued a warrant for the arrest of the murderer and summoned the bathhouse workers for interrogation. It is now known that Wang Juchang hid elsewhere after the crime. On the one hand, he asked people to intercede with the victim (the wife of the deceased) to ask for money to settle the matter. Later, because the District Procuratorate was investigating urgently and repeatedly summoned workers for questioning, Wang feared implicating the innocent and surrendered himself to the court. After several interrogations by the District Procuratorate, Wang confessed without denial. Yesterday, the court filed a lawsuit with the criminal court on the charge of causing death by injury.</p>

<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>I have just read your newspaper and noticed a section on the Baoshan Party Affairs Dispute. This is inconsistent with the facts. The Baoshan Party affairs have been well managed for a long time and there are no disputes. Before me, Xuetian was the head of the Baoshan Urban-Rural Public Education Center for a year and a half and was repeatedly commended by the educational authorities. In August of this year, Xuetian was ordered to go to the central government for training. The Education Bureau ignored the facts and dismissed Xuetian with the words "ineffective work." However, a week after the dismissal, Xuetian received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, commending him for his excellent performance. At the Jiangsu Provincial Government banquet a few days ago, Xuetian also reported this matter in detail. Chairman Chen and the heads of various departments, as well as the members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, all found it strange and regrettable. Xuetian is now serving in Yutang, and his future actions will be determined by the Party and the country. The report in your newspaper is obviously a rumor intended to confuse public opinion. I am writing this special letter to correct this. Please publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section. I would be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhu Xuetian</p>

The petition stated: "To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, we have received a joint letter from the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Southern Vietnam and the Overseas Chinese Association for Promoting the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, requesting that we forward their appeal for the conclusion of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. Aside from the original documents on file, we will not repeat them. However, it is stated at the end: 'The industry and commerce of overseas Chinese in Vietnam are in a desperate situation. The only hope lies in the implementation of the Sino-French Commercial Treaty, reducing tariffs on Chinese goods and improving the treatment of overseas Chinese. Therefore, they are struggling to survive, awaiting a change in the situation.' We respectfully request that you urgently negotiate with France to reduce the tariffs on Chinese goods entering Vietnam. For goods that previously enjoyed special preferential tariff rates, we request that they be restored. For other Chinese goods, we request that they receive the most favored nation tariff rate.' We have approved this. This case has been repeatedly reported and urged by affiliated associations. The Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty has been delayed for several years, leaving hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam eagerly awaiting the relief this treaty would provide. The situation is particularly urgent. It is appropriate to cable the Ministry again to examine and approve this matter, and earnestly request that you promptly consult with the French Minister to conclude the treaty as soon as possible to reassure the overseas Chinese. This is our most sincere plea.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce of the Republic of China (Stamped)"</p>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Southern Vietnam and the Overseas Chinese Association for Promoting the Sino-French Commercial Treaty have also submitted a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent a copy to the National Federation of Commerce for reference. The original text is as follows: "We respectfully submit this document regarding the revision of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty and request the establishment of preferential tariffs for Chinese goods imported into Vietnam. On September 24th, we received a reply dated September 12th, No. Ou 8143, stating: 'We have received your submission. Upon investigation, the Sino-French-Vietnamese Treaty of May 16, 1930, clearly stipulates the rights that overseas Chinese should enjoy in terms of personal safety and commerce. Once the appendixes A and B are signed and the new treaty is implemented, the various unfavorable treatments currently suffered by overseas Chinese can be gradually improved. This Ministry will naturally negotiate strongly with the French side based on the interests of overseas Chinese to ensure the implementation of the new treaty. Please inform us accordingly.' We immediately announced this to the overseas Chinese in Vietnam for their information. On September 20th, we sent a submission reporting the Vietnamese government's plan to force Chinese merchants to use Western bookkeeping methods, and attached a French regulation regarding this matter. We trust that it has already reached your esteemed attention. We are now attaching a list of the types of Chinese goods imported into Vietnam and their new and old tariff rates for your consideration. We also request that you negotiate with the French government to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods entering Vietnam. For goods that previously enjoyed special preferential tariff rates, we request that they be restored. For other Chinese goods, we request that they receive the most favored nation tariff rate, so that Chinese goods can regain their sales channels in Vietnam and save the industry and commerce of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Furthermore, we are extremely concerned and eager to know the progress of the discussions between your ministry and the representatives of the French government regarding the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. The industry and commerce of overseas Chinese are in a desperate situation. The only hope lies in the implementation of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, reducing tariffs on Chinese goods, and improving the treatment of overseas Chinese. Therefore, they are struggling to survive, awaiting a change in the situation. We implore your Ministry to save them and to inform us of the progress of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty negotiations to appease public opinion. This would be a great kindness."</p>

<p>Attended by Over Four Thousand People, a Great Success</p>
<p>Newspaper Association Held a Luncheon Banquet</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese magnate Hu Wenhu has been warmly welcomed by all sectors since his arrival in Shanghai. He has been visiting the city center and major factories for several days. Yesterday at noon, the Shanghai Newspaper Association held a banquet for Mr. Hu Wenhu at the Tongxinglou Restaurant. At 3 PM, Shanghai organizations held the Shanghai Organizations Welcome Mr. Hu Wenhu Meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge. Over four thousand representatives attended. Mr. Hu arrived on time, entering the venue amidst the melodious military music and enthusiastic applause from the representatives. After Mr. Hu arrived, he announced the opening of the meeting. The meeting was very enthusiastic. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Newspaper Association Banquet <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Association, including Ma Yinliang, Wang Boqi, Huang Bohui, Xiong Shaohao, Pan Gongzhan, Guan Ji'an, Wu Shirong, etc., held a luncheon banquet for the leader of the Nanyang overseas Chinese, Mr. Hu Wenhu, at the Tongxinglou Hall yesterday at 12 noon. They also invited Hu Zhongying, Ye Guisong, Li Dachao, Hu Guigeng, Lang Jingshan, etc. to accompany him. Over thirty guests and hosts attended. During the banquet, Chairman Yuan Yeyu delivered a welcome speech, stating: "Today, I especially represent the colleagues of our association to welcome Mr. Hu. Mr. Hu is visiting for the second time since his return to China in 1929. We have a deep impression of Mr. Hu. Today, I would like to mention a few points to show our admiration: (1) Mr. Hu has established many newspapers in Nanyang and South China. The Sing Tao Daily in Singapore has become the center of public opinion in Nanyang. Therefore, Mr. Hu is not only a magnate businessman but also a great supporter of the newspaper industry. (2) Only an entire country can fight with other countries, but Mr. Hu can fight the world alone. This is truly commendable. (3) Mr. Hu repeatedly returns to China, allowing domestic compatriots to communicate news and connect feelings with overseas Chinese. Mr. Hu is a powerful facilitator. (4) Mr. Hu has established many businesses abroad, especially those that promote Chinese culture, which has contributed to the country. All of the above are the reasons why we welcome Mr. Hu today. I would like to raise a glass to wish Mr. Hu good health." Then, Mr. Hu Guigeng delivered a reply speech on behalf of Mr. Hu, stating: "I am honored to be able to meet with the leaders of the press today. Mr. Hu is a layman in the newspaper industry. I am grateful for this opportunity to learn from you. As for the four points mentioned by the chairman, they are an overstatement of Mr. Hu. I am truly unworthy. However, I will work harder with everyone's guidance, and I hope that you will provide more guidance to overseas Chinese so that they can pay attention to investing in the motherland and supporting construction." The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and did not disperse until 2:30 PM.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Venue: The venue was originally scheduled to be at the New Asia Restaurant, but due to the large number of participating organizations, it was temporarily moved to the City Chamber of Commerce. At the entrance of the City Chamber of Commerce, the Party and national flags were hung, as well as a bamboo cloth banner that read "Shanghai Organizations Welcome Mr. Hu Wenhu Meeting." Boy Scouts were stationed inside to maintain order. Lianhua Film Company also sent cameramen to the venue to film the meeting.

A military band was hired to play music at the venue.</p>

Finally, Hu Wenhu delivered a reply speech, followed by photography and adjournment. It was already after 5 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Mr. Hu Wenhu has carried on his father's business and has been doing business in Burma for more than seventy years. With his sophisticated talent and unique insights, he has been able to withstand the tides of the world market downturn and the decline of overseas Chinese businesses. His business has grown year by year. Judging from his achievements, among the overseas Chinese in Burma, apart from the late Mr. Lin Zhenzong of Fujian, Mr. Hu is undoubtedly the most prominent. We have admired his demeanor for many years. However, due to the vastness of the sea and sky, it has been difficult to meet him. We have only been able to express our admiration privately for his business. Now, we are fortunate that he has returned to the motherland for inspection. His visit coincides with the 73rd anniversary of his father, Mr. Ziqin, going to Burma. Two generations of hard work have created this great cause, opening up a glorious history for the overseas Chinese in Burma. This is even more meaningful than celebrating an individual's 70th birthday. Our association has prepared some refreshments today to hold this welcome meeting, which is nothing less than a celebration of the success of Mr. Hu and his father's seventy-year career in Burma. We are deeply delighted to have you here. It is often said that the British territories are all over the world, so their national flag has no sunset. Although our country's political power is not as good as theirs, the overseas Chinese are diligent and hardworking. Without the protection of the state, their footprints are all over the five continents. They often start from scratch and succeed. They can then use the capital earned from their hard work to benefit the motherland. Mencius said, 'Those who wait for King Wen to rise are ordinary people. As for heroes, they will rise even without King Wen.' Only our overseas Chinese are capable of this kind of courage. Therefore, our association is holding this welcome meeting today not only to celebrate the success of Mr. Hu's personal career but also to represent the Chinese people in expressing our gratitude to Mr. Hu for his continued support of the motherland's cause. On the one hand, we want to take this opportunity to show that the motherland is intensifying its construction, and it is in great need of the enthusiastic support of overseas Chinese. Our association knows that most overseas Chinese are struggling in adversity, and we have not heard that the Chinese people have provided any real protection. It is truly shameful to give without receiving. However, the protection of overseas Chinese and the prosperity of the motherland are closely related. To prosper the motherland, we must start by intensifying construction. Mr. Hu has a clear understanding of the situation, so he has repeatedly invested heavily in the motherland's construction, never tiring. This spirit of public service is the key to the revival of our nation and can serve as an example for the general public in the country. We believe that there will be those who will rise up in response to this trend. As the saying goes, words are limited, but the meaning is endless. Today, distinguished guests have arrived, and time is precious. I dare not bore you with lengthy words. I will just briefly state my thoughts and hope for your correction."</p>
<p>Speeches from All Sectors: After Yu's speech, Zhang Shouyong spoke, saying, "Today, Shanghai organizations welcome Mr. Hu Wenhu because he has made great contributions to society and because he is overseas but does not forget his motherland. Mr. Hu has inherited his father's business, worked hard, and gradually expanded it. His purpose in developing his business is to help the development of all social undertakings, such as education, journalism, and charity. Those who have received Mr. Hu's help are everywhere. Today, the country is suffering from natural and man-made disasters, which have plunged the people into deep water and fire. We hope that Mr. Hu can maintain his past spirit and continue to take effective measures to save us from this crisis. At a time when the country is making every effort to promote industry and commerce, we also expect Mr. Hu to do his best to invest." Wang Xiaolai spoke, saying, "Mr. Hu is an overseas Chinese who does not forget his motherland. Mr. Hu is an overseas Chinese who promotes the sale of national products abroad. Mr. Hu is an overseas Chinese who promotes industry. Mr. Hu can show his great personality everywhere. Therefore, Shanghai organizations have given him such a warm welcome." Chu Huiseng spoke, saying, "Today, there are disaster victims everywhere in the country. Taking Zhejiang as an example, millions of people have been affected by the drought. Mr. Hu has a heart to save the world, and he will surely do his best to help these disaster-stricken compatriots." Xu Tongxiong spoke, saying, "We hope that Mr. Hu can return to the country this time to conduct a detailed inspection, and we especially hope that Mr. Hu can travel to the Northwest. The Northwest is a treasure trove of our country. We hope that Mr. Hu can use his spirit of investing in industry to help the government develop the Northwest." Finally, Qu Wenliu spoke, saying, "Everyone knows Mr. Hu's spirit of loving his motherland. There is no need to say more. At a time when the country is in trouble, Mr. Hu will surely provide great help to his motherland."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's Reply: After the representatives finished their speeches, Hu Wenhu stood up and gave a speech, saying, "This time I returned to China to visit the new Shanghai plan and inspect the new construction in various places. I have been warmly welcomed by all sectors since arriving in Shanghai, and I feel honored and ashamed. I am even more embarrassed that the newspapers have mistakenly praised me as a great entrepreneur and a great philanthropist. It is the duty of all mankind to use surplus wealth to seek the welfare of the society and the people. I inherited my father's ambition and managed the pharmaceutical business. Although I have accumulated a lot of savings over the decades, I have always regarded it as something external. Money is both omnipotent and evil. If it is used well, it will certainly benefit the people. If it is not used well, it will not only create sins for oneself but also harm future generations. Although I do not hate evil capitalists, I often feel afraid of being a capitalist. Therefore, I am willing to use all the profits from my business every year for charitable and public welfare purposes, rather than buying land and houses and boasting about my wealth. The shops of our various branches are all rented from others, which is proof of this. However, these actions are only to fulfill my wishes and do what I can. People in the society have added the title of philanthropist to me. Although your intention is to promote good, it is very good, but I feel that the name is more than the reality, and I can't help but feel ashamed. In the future, I will work harder and do my best to serve the society. I plan to set up a hospital in each province of our country in five or ten years to repay the kindness of you and the people in society. If the rich can use their surplus money to seek the welfare of the society and the people, then use the wealth of the society to do the things of the society. Those who get it from the society should use it in the society. There is no class, and there is no struggle. This is my personal belief. Today, I am honored to receive your love, and I will mention it. As for visiting the city center and the new construction in various places in the past few days, I feel very satisfied. In particular, the Greater Shanghai plan is admirable. Eight years ago, I came to Shanghai and visited Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places. At that time, I felt that the land there was very good, but it was like wasteland, which was a pity. I had a vision of Greater Shanghai in my heart. Unexpectedly, when I revisit this place today, the Greater Shanghai in my dream has been gradually realized. How happy is it! Today, I am grateful to the organizations for holding a meeting to welcome me. There are many things I want to talk to you about, but due to time constraints, I can only briefly mention one or two. I will listen to your teachings again when I have the opportunity. Now, I would like to thank you very sincerely."</p>

<h3 id="e124">Five Banks Continued to Discuss the Wei River Diversion Loan Contract Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>An Agreement Can Be Reached After One or Two More Meetings</p>
<p>The Loan Disbursement Method Has Been Determined, and Funds Will Be Allocated at Any Time</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, after Lei Baohua, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Department, consulted with the borrowing banks at the Central Bank the day before yesterday, the Wei River Diversion Loan in Shaanxi Province has been determined to be 1.5 million yuan, with the water and land tax of the Luo, Jing, and Wei canals as the guarantee fund, and it is stipulated that the loan will be repaid within three years. It is learned that the borrowing banks continued to meet at the Central Bank on the third floor yesterday afternoon at 4 PM to discuss the loan contract. Chen Xing and Zhou Bangxin from the Central Bank, Zhang Peishen and Jin Guobao from the Bank of Communications, Liu Yingnong and Cheng Muhao from the Bank of China, Zou Bingwen from the Shanghai Bank, and Chen Liting from the Jincheng Bank, etc., attended.

After the meeting, Zhou Bangxin, Deputy Manager of the Central Bank, told a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency that the 1.5 million yuan Wei River Diversion Loan was borrowed by five banks: Central, China, Communications, Shanghai, and Jincheng.

As for the loan disbursement method, it has been decided that funds will be allocated at any time. The annual interest rate is still being discussed.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Sea Yuan Steamer Completes Factory Inspection Today, Reception Ceremony to be Held Tomorrow <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Minister Zhu Comes to Shanghai to Attend</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's new steamer, the Hai Yuan, has undergone continuous inspections since entering the Jiangnan Shipyard and is nearing completion. It is expected to leave the factory today and dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The reception ceremony will be held tomorrow. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Completion of Inspection and Departure from Factory: According to the contract, the ship was to be delivered in Shanghai, so it entered the Jiangnan Shipyard for a detailed inspection of all parts. The inspection costs were borne by the Swan Hunter Shipbuilders, who built the ship. The inspection has been ongoing for eight days since the ship entered the factory. Shen Jiyun, the general shipmaster of the China Merchants Bureau, has also been inspecting the ship daily and listening to inspection reports. The ship is expected to complete inspection and leave the factory today, moving to Jinliyuan Wharf.</p>
<p>Handover Procedures: The handover procedure involves the Jiangnan Shipyard sending the inspection report to the China Merchants Bureau. Once the bureau deems all parts qualified and in accordance with the contract, a telegram will be sent to London, instructing the supervising committee in the UK to pay the final installment of the ship's price to the shipyard. The shipyard will then telegram its Shanghai representative, Malcolm, to hand over the Hai Yuan to the bureau. Of the eight officers and sixteen sailors sent by the shipyard, all but one engineer will leave the ship, and the officers and sailors assigned by the bureau will board the ship to take up their duties. As of yesterday, the return telegram from the UK had not arrived, so the ship has not yet been handed over.</p>
<p>Reception Ceremony: The bureau will hold a grand ceremony for the reception of the Hai Yuan. It has been scheduled for 2:30 PM tomorrow. Five hundred invitations have already been sent out, including representatives from the military, government, press, and various sectors of Shanghai, as well as many foreign guests. Minister of Transportation Zhu Jia骅 will represent the bureau as the chairman of the reception ceremony. Director of the Maritime Administration Gao Tingzi will also come to Shanghai to participate in the grand ceremony. (The order of ceremony was published in this newspaper on the 12th of last month)</p>
<p>Crew Boarding: The entire crew has been appointed by the bureau. After the ship arrives at the wharf today, twenty-five service personnel will be the first to board the ship. Personnel in charge of the deck will also be dispatched to board the ship to inspect and receive items on board. The captain and other officers will board the ship and officially assume their duties once the handover telegram arrives from the UK.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Another Two Disaster Prevention Drills to be Held in the City <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Interview with Director Yang Hu of the Security Department</p>
<p>Another Drill on a Snowy and Cold Night</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Director Yang Hu of the Municipal Security Department told the agency that various party, government, and military agencies in the city had conducted disaster prevention drills starting from the 3rd. The results of the drills showed that, being the initial stages, there was a lack of coordination. However, the personnel's morale was good, and their actions were swift. Director Yang believes that the results of this drill are insufficient to cope with a disaster. Therefore, drills will continue in the future to ensure that disasters can be handled with ease. It has now been decided to hold a second disaster prevention drill on a snowy, cold, and freezing night.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Military Expert Discusses Air Defense <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Technology and Equipment: Our Country's Architecture Largely Ignores These Conditions, While Tokyo, Japan, Has Already Made Preparations</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, with the progress of science, the past planar warfare has been transformed into three-dimensional warfare. In addition to actively expanding their air forces, countries are also paying attention to air defense technology and equipment. A Central News Agency reporter met with a military expert who recently returned from overseas inspections. The expert stated that our country's architecture largely ignores air defense conditions and urgently needs to be improved to respond to emergencies. The details of the conversation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Uniformity in Height is Essential: According to the expert, the biggest shortcoming of our country's architecture is the extreme difference in height. Taking Shanghai's buildings as an example, the lower ones, apart from a few bungalows, are mostly two to three stories or even five to six stories, while the higher ones are over ten stories or even twenty stories. The difference in height is extreme, making them easy targets for aerial bombardment. The extreme difference in height makes them easily identifiable from the air, making it easy to determine which ones to bomb. After the great earthquake, all the buildings in Tokyo had similar heights. When Tokyo held air defense drills, it was discovered that the building of Tokyo's largest department store was higher than other buildings. The department store was notified to demolish one floor to eliminate the target for bombing. This is the responsibility of the government. Our country's recent palace-style buildings are often painted in conspicuous red and green colors, which also makes them easy targets for bombing and goes against air defense conditions.</p>
<p>Underground Facilities are Necessary: Recently, the top floors of new-style buildings in various countries around the world have flat terraces for deploying large nets and stacking sandbags to prevent bomb explosions during air raids. Underground facilities are also necessary for storing important documents and serving as shelters in case of emergency. In contrast, our country's architecture focuses on aesthetics and is not practical at all. This is deeply unsettling. This is the responsibility of architects, and it is hoped that they will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting Discusses Commercial Registration Law <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Resolution to Support Article 9 of the Draft Law</p>
<p>Request to Supplement Article 2 of the Draft Law</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, since Article 681 of the Civil Code's Law of Obligations stipulates that partners are jointly liable for partnership debts, the business community across the country has requested amendments due to conflicts with legislative fairness, policies, and the economic status quo of our country. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also submitted two petitions to the Legislative Yuan in March and June of last year, requesting amendments. The Legislative Yuan decided to draft a Commercial Registration Law to remedy this. The draft law has now been completed by the Legislative Yuan, reviewed in meetings, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has been requested to send representatives Chen Zheqing and Luo Qinghua to Beijing to express their opinions. The research was very detailed. The two representatives have now returned to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees to discuss the matter. Yu Zuoting, Jin Runxiang, Chen Zheqing, Ke Ganchen, Ma Shaoquan, Zheng Chengqing, Chen Yizhou, Hu Xiyuan, Zheng Zenan, Pan Xusheng, Ma Jiliang, Cheng Yujie, Luo Qinghua, Fang Jiaobo, and others attended. Yu Zuoting chaired the meeting. After the formalities, Chen Zheqing and Luo Qinghua reported on their experience attending the meeting in Beijing. Then, the draft Commercial Registration Law was discussed. It was resolved that Article 9 of the draft, which stipulates that "If the names and addresses of the partners and the types and amounts of their contributions have been registered by the individuals with the competent authority in the location of the business, they shall be liable for sharing losses within the limit of their contributions. The same shall apply when shares are transferred or changed," was unanimously supported, and it was hoped that it would be passed smoothly. Regarding Article 2 of the draft, which states that "Commercial registration shall be made by the parties concerned with the competent authority in the location of the business," it was requested to be supplemented to state that those with trade associations should have the association forward it to the Chamber of Commerce, and those without trade associations should have the Chamber of Commerce directly forward it, in order to comply with Article 7 of the Legislative Yuan's amended Trade Association Law, which states that trade companies and firms should join the association, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Submits Petition Urging Amendment of New Stamp Tax Law <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a further petition to the Executive Yuan urging the amendment of the new Stamp Tax Law, stating that: This petition concerns the urgent matter of requesting the amendment of the Stamp Tax Law. On the 7th of this month, we received a letter from the Silk and Satin Trade Association, stating that they had received a joint letter from 175 member companies, stating that after reading the newspaper reports, they were shocked to learn that the draft Stamp Tax Law prepared by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that the tax rates for invoices, bills, receipts, etc., are one cent for amounts from three yuan to ten yuan, and an additional one cent for every additional ten yuan. The stamp tax for stocks, loan agreements, contracts, etc., is two cents per hundred yuan, and the stamp tax for books is two jiao per year, which is several times or even dozens of times higher than the provisional regulations. They were extremely alarmed by this. They stated that in recent years, economic recession has spread across the country, and silk merchants are suffering from high tax rates and sluggish business conditions, making it difficult to maintain their businesses. They are unable to cope with the increased stamp tax rates, and the progressive calculation method is particularly burdensome. They requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward their request to the government, urging the government to consider the difficulties of merchants and reduce the tax rates to alleviate their plight, etc. (omitted). Based on this, we request that your association quickly forward our request, urging the government to consider the difficulties of merchants and appropriately reduce the stamp tax rates and abolish the progressive calculation method to maintain commerce. This will be greatly appreciated. We have already telegraphed the Central Political Council directly on October 13, requesting that it correct the situation based on the principles of the Stamp Tax Law formulated last year. We also submitted another petition to your council on October 18, requesting that you forward it to the National Government to temporarily not announce the implementation of the law until the Central Political Council has corrected it. Two weeks have passed since then, and we have not received a reply. We have repeatedly received detailed information from the paper, tea, and timber industries, requesting us to continue to appeal. Now, we have received a letter from the association with the same request. The amendment of the tax law is truly the universal and urgent wish of merchants. We hereby submit another written petition for your review and approval, urging you to investigate and approve the various points mentioned in the previous petitions as soon as possible, as it will be in the public interest.</p>

<h3 id="e134">China Foreign Famine Relief Committee Conducting Emergency Relief in Various Regions <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Haining and Haiyan: The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee is working hard to raise relief funds due to the severe drought in Haining and Haiyan, but fundraising is difficult. It has jointly launched a campaign with the Jisheng Association and Haining gentry in Shanghai. The Haining gentry raised 20,000 yuan, and the Jisheng Association and the committee jointly contributed 20,000 yuan, totaling 40,000 yuan. This is only enough to cover the third and fifth districts of Haining. The investigation was initiated, and although the investigation of the fifth district has been completed, there are 10,780 households in need of relief. Most households have four to five to seven to eight people. The third district is still under investigation, but it is also a significant number. Currently, there are too few resources for too many people, making it difficult to distribute them. It is reported that the three organizations will each raise another 5,000 yuan, totaling 15,000 yuan, bringing the total to 55,000 yuan. It is still unknown how this will be handled. The committee has also decided to allocate 5,000 yuan to Haiyan and will soon begin distributing emergency relief.</p>
<p>Liyang and Yixing: The disaster situation in these two areas is the most tragic and severe in Jiangsu Province. The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee has decided to allocate 10,000 yuan for emergency relief. The Wuxi Red Swastika Society has also raised 25,000 yuan for relief and is jointly conducting relief efforts. Because there are too many disaster victims in the area and too little relief money, there are concerns that riots will occur. The Red Swastika Society has raised another 10,000 yuan, and the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee has raised another 5,000 yuan. Shanghai gentry, recognizing the severity and scope of the disaster, have also contributed 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. They are jointly purchasing flour, and Lu Bohong will go to preside over the relief distribution. The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee has also raised 5,000 yuan for emergency relief in Yixing and will proceed with it in order.</p>
<p>Jiangbei and Jiangpu: The drought in Jiangbei is extremely severe, especially in Jiangpu. It is reported that the committee has allocated more than 8,000 yuan and is cooperating with cooperatives to distribute seeds and provide emergency relief.</p>

<p>No Water Nearby to Put Out the Fire</p>
<p>Three Houses Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Three bungalows were built on the open space at the south end of Sangguan Hall, Tangqiao Road, Pudong. The He Xinglong incense shop was opened there. The owner is a woman surnamed Jiang from Tongzhou, who employed more than a dozen workers. Yesterday evening around 8:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out for unknown reasons. The workers were unable to put it out, and it quickly spread. The nearby police officers sounded the whistle for help. Because there was no hydrant nearby, dozens of villagers could only draw water to put out the fire, which was to no avail. After burning for about two hours, all three houses were completely destroyed. Huang, the chief of the Tangqiao Police Station, ordered the fire victim Jiang to be summoned to the station for questioning.</p>

<p>Husband Misunderstands and Thinks It's a Joke</p>
<p>Tragedy Starts with a Trivial Matter, One Life Lost</p>
<p>Chen Yanghe, a 42-year-old man from Yancheng, and his wife Chen Fu, a 45-year-old woman, had two daughters and four sons. The sons are named Huaidong, Huainan, Huaixi, and Huaibei. The two daughters had already died. The family of six came to Shanghai to make a living because the rural family in their hometown had gone bankrupt and it was difficult to make a living. They lived at No. 28 Heming Lane, Dakang Lane, Kanti Road, French Concession. Chen set up a private school to teach at No. 26 next door. The four sons were all peddlers, making a living on their own. Chen's wife worked at home. At around 2:00 PM on the 6th of this month, a night soil worker came to collect the monthly fee of two jiao. Fu replied that she had no money and promised to pay it the next day. The night soil worker agreed, smiling and patting Fu on the shoulder several times before leaving. Chen Yanghe happened to see this and blamed his wife for joking with the night soil worker. Feeling wronged and unable to express her anger, she had a sudden thought. At around 10:00 AM the next morning, while her husband was out teaching and the four sons were out working, she committed suicide by hanging herself on the mezzanine on the second floor of the house. Around noon, Chen Yanghe returned home for lunch and discovered it. She had already died of suffocation, and her body was as cold as ice. He reported it to the French Police Department, who sent detectives to investigate the cause of death. Then, the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall Morgue. Yesterday morning, the Second Special Court commissioned Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor to examine the body and confirm that Chen Fu had indeed died of hanging herself before death. The body was handed over to her husband, Chen Yanghe, to claim the body and prepare for the funeral.</p>

<p>Ji Qingyuan, a fifteen-year-old from Haimen, was working as a young laborer at the Puyi No. 2 Cotton Mill at No. 8 Labour Sheng Road. At precisely 7:00 PM the night before, while he was working in the factory, a belt on a machine suddenly came loose from its axle. He intended to climb up and put the belt back in place, but unfortunately, the machine was still running. Ji was not careful enough at the time, and his sleeve got caught in the machine. Soon, various parts of his body were also severely crushed. Another worker, Jiang Guisheng, caught sight of the situation and quickly tried to rescue him, but it was too late. The factory took him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He soon died. The hospital reported to the Putuo Road Police Station in charge of the area, and they ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Tang, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, court clerk Wang Zuyi, and others to examine the body. Witness Jiang Guisheng testified that he was thirty-four years old, from Chongming, and a worker at the Puyi Factory. He said that he managed the machine and that the deceased happened to be sweeping the floor next to the machine when he saw the belt come off. Ji then volunteered to go up and install it, but he was not careful enough and was suddenly crushed by the machine. After seeing this, he immediately closed the machine door and tried to save him, but it was already too late, and so on. Ji Wanqing, the deceased's father, also gave a statement. Prosecutor Tang then declared that the deceased, Ji Qingyuan, was indeed injured by a machine and died. The body was handed over to his father, Ji Wanqing, who signed a receipt to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Continued Hearing of Liang Tongfang's Bombing Case <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Liang claims his intention was only to warn, not to kill.</p>
<p>The judge argues that kind words and advice should be used instead of throwing bombs.</p>
<p>—Because the case still requires investigation, the hearing is postponed to Saturday.—</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang, a patriotic young man from Shaoxing, was upset about the sale of inferior goods at the Yuelai Southern Goods Store at No. 354 Guangdong Road. So, at noon on the 19th of last month, he carried a bomb with the intention of giving a warning. Unexpectedly, the bomb exploded before he could throw it, injuring four people, including Yuelai staff member Pan Honghe, and seriously injuring Liang himself. He was arrested and taken to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide presided over a continued hearing in the Criminal Division. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that since the adjournment, he had repeatedly inquired with Liang about the true situation, but Liang refused to tell the truth. Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station searched Liang's residence at the East Asia Institute of Physical Education and found many leaflets. They contained phrases like "If you do not awaken, you will be annihilated," implying an intention to kill. The defendant previously stated that the bomb would explode one or two minutes after being thrown, but according to the foreign detective chief, this is not true. He brought an identical bomb to court today to prove that it could explode immediately. The Municipal Council is prosecuting under Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for attempted murder. Then, the foreign detective chief submitted a report on the use of the bomb. When questioned, Liang Tongfang testified that he went to Yuelai only to give a warning. He first told the store staff to leave and then removed the safety pin from the bomb, but it unexpectedly exploded immediately. If he had not told them to leave, he would not have been so badly injured himself. On the 18th, he and several comrades met at the Heming Hotel. He could not remember the room number but knew that the room was booked under the name of Hong En. The bombs they brought should have exploded one or two minutes after being thrown, but this time it exploded before it was thrown. The leaflets that were seized were delivered by comrades the night after September 18th. On September 18th, he distributed them to various stores, giving them one month to stop buying inferior goods or face annihilation, which was also intended as a warning and not intended to kill. He obtained the bomb after retiring from the Beiping Anti-Traitor Corps. The court then told him that since the government had not ordered a ban on the sale of inferior goods, one should simply advise unscrupulous merchants kindly. (Liang replied:) "Because inferior goods sell well in our country, causing economic panic, no one has ever listened to warnings." The court then asked the foreign detective chief whether Liang Tongfang's claim that the bomb could not kill people was true. (The detective chief replied:) "It can indeed kill many people." Next, Pan Honghe, a staff member of Yuelai Store, testified that he was just finishing his meal and going to work in the store when he saw Liang speaking eloquently. His two colleagues, Fu Rongsheng and Ding Yanzhi, did not understand what he was saying. Liang looked very agitated. He was about to go forward to inquire when the bomb exploded. He was injured in the face and did not know anything else. Police lawyer Wang then stated that the Yuelai Southern Goods Store received a letter on the 5th of this month from an assassination group with its name on it, with two points worth noting: (1) it mentioned using a handgun; (2) it demanded that Yuelai pay 20,000 yuan. He then presented the letter to the court. The court showed the letter to Liang and asked if it was written by his comrades. After reading it, Liang replied that the letter was not written by his comrades but by speculators who were taking advantage of the situation to sabotage their work and profit from it. At this point, the court, finding that further investigation was required, adjourned the hearing to Saturday of this week.</p>

<p>Criminals and loot handed over together</p>
<p>The morphine den on the third floor of the Japanese restaurant at No. 59 Henglu Dou Le'an Road, North Sichuan Road, was raided by the Diswei Road Police Station at about 4:00 PM on September 15th. A great deal of evidence was seized, along with the arrested Japanese man Ikeda, Chinese men Zhang Asan, Wang Asan, and Hang Xiqing, etc. They were all sent to the First Special District Court. The Japanese man Ikeda was transferred to the Japanese Consulate for investigation. Later, because it was found that the incident occurred in the Chinese territory, there was a question of jurisdiction, so the witnesses were transferred to the Nanshi Local Court. Prosecutor Xie Lian conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered them to be detained separately. A large number of seized items were placed on file pending instructions. It is now learned that yesterday afternoon, Director Wen Hongen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau instructed Captain Lu of the Detective Team to order team leader Gu Liancheng to take Detective Zhong Enquan, carrying documents, to the Local Court to request the transfer of the above three criminals along with the evidence. Prosecutor Xie approved the request. The Public Security Bureau hired a moving truck, parked in the open space behind the court. The clerk of the seized goods warehouse took out all the evidence and handed it over item by item, including the machine and large and small morphine vats, which were quite numerous. Team leader Gu verified that everything was correct and transported them back to the Public Security Bureau first, and then took the three criminals, Zhang Asan, etc., to the Bureau for detention pending instructions.</p>

She hoped that they would continue to work hard to achieve their goals. Next, Mrs. Tao Aidi, president of the American Red Cross, gave a speech. She said that she was very happy to attend the event. She had been in China for a week and deeply felt that the work with Chinese children was extremely important. China has 130 million children, but only 8 million are in school, which shows the lack of universal education for children. Three points should be noted for children's work: (1) children's health; (2) personality development; (3) educational training. The YWCA has always paid attention to family work, and many members are mothers of children. They have a great responsibility for this fundamental work of the nation. She hoped they would work hard to cultivate good citizens and wished the fundraising success. Then, Ms. Xue Weizengpei and Mrs. Bai Yuehan reported on the fundraising results. Team 1, Mrs. Lin Yutang, 410 yuan; Team 4, Ms. Zhou Cuiying, 550 yuan; Team 6, Mrs. Huang Shubei, 186 yuan and 2 jiao; Team 8, Ms. Li Guanfang, 50 yuan; Team 10, Mrs. Zhu Tingqi, 70 yuan; Team 11, Mrs. Jian Youwen, 420 yuan; Team 12, Mrs. Huang Xiufeng, 600 yuan; Team 13, Ms. Lu Deyin, 195 yuan; Team 14, Mrs. Li Ting'an, 20 yuan; Team 15, Mrs. He Linyi; Team 16, Mrs. Dong Xianguang, 560 yuan; Team 17, Dr. Kuang Cuie, 5 yuan; Team 18, Mrs. Wang Zhengxu, 675 yuan; Team 19, Mrs. Hai, 100 yuan; Team 20, Mrs. Mo, 200 yuan; Team 21, Mrs. Bai, 315 yuan; and a special donation of 3,000 yuan, for a total of 7,356 yuan and 2 jiao. There are a total of 21 fundraising teams in the association, and only 15 teams have reported their totals. The total amount should be more than this. Within a week, there have been such achievements, which shows the efforts of the staff of each team. It is heard that the second progress report meeting is scheduled to be held on the 15th at the British Consulate General on the Bund.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Joint Meeting of Various Organizations Decides to Bury Pan Hongsheng in the May 30th Cemetery <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Also passes a resolution to erect a memorial to Martyr Pan</p>
<p>Concession authorities refuse to issue a funeral permit</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Assistance to Patriotic Martyrs Committee convened a joint meeting of representatives from various organizations at the committee's location at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss and decide on matters such as public burial and the erection of a monument. In addition, the British and French Concession police authorities have refused to issue permits for Martyr Pan's funeral on the 11th, which has caused great indignation among all circles. It has been decided to continue negotiations. The details learned by the reporter of the Xin Xin News Agency are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives' Meeting Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, various organizations convened a joint meeting at the City General Chamber of Commerce. Over one hundred people attended, including Chen Jiufeng, Chen Binghui, Wang Jingdong, Qu Zhenhua, Zhang Xianfang, etc. Chen Jiufeng, Chen Peide, and Liu Zhongying served as the presidium. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Burial location: (Resolution) It was decided to designate the May 30th Cemetery as the burial place for Martyr Pan and to send a letter to the board of directors of the May 30th Cemetery to be handled by the funeral committee. (2) Erecting a monument to commemorate Martyr Pan Hongsheng: (Resolution) Passed. (3) Compensation: (Resolution) To submit a request to the government for compensation and to seek donations from all circles to compensate the family. The method will be formulated by the Patriotic Martyrs Association. (4) Date of memorial service: (Resolution) Set for December 7th. (5-7) To be handled by the funeral committee. (5) Present a request to the Fifth National Congress to prohibit the police from abusing electric shocks: (Resolution) Passed. (6) To publish a declaration against the illegal sentencing by the concession authorities, Tao Leqin was appointed to draft it. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Refusal to Issue Permit Representatives from various organizations, Qu Zhenhua and Zhang Xianfang, reported on the progress of applying for permits from the British and French authorities. The representatives reported that they applied to the British and French Concession police departments for funeral permits today but were refused. All requests were rejected. When repeatedly asked for the reason for the refusal, the reason given was that Pan Hongsheng's actions had political implications and that there was a fear that gangsters would take the opportunity to cause trouble along the way. After the representatives explained in detail and reduced the number of people attending the funeral, the authorities still insisted on not issuing the permit. The representatives asked for instructions from all the representatives.</p>
<p>Expressions from All Circles Upon learning of the above situation, representatives from all circles were indignant. They all believed that Martyr Pan sacrificed himself for the patriotic movement, which was very obvious. How could it be that the citizens of our country are not allowed to pass through the concessions leased to foreigners because they are patriotic? How can we accept the obstruction of the patriotic national movement of our citizens? Even if it is said that Pan Hongsheng's actions did contain undesirable political motives, he is already dead. Why should he not be allowed to be buried? If there is a fear that unscrupulous elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble, then the police have the responsibility to maintain law and order. According to the representatives' report, the authorities said that they could take a detour through the Chinese territory. However, the Xijin Guild Hall is located on Haining Road in the Public Concession. How will that be handled? Fortunately, Pan lived in the Chinese territory. If he lived in the concession, the coffin would not be able to leave. It is not known whether the authorities have regulations for refusing to issue funeral permits. Since the concession authorities said that there was no basis for it, the representatives' meeting should send representatives to continue to fight for it. Otherwise, the concession authorities will be responsible for any disputes.</p>
<p>Public Memorial by Righteous Army Members of the Shanghai Citizens' Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army held a meeting at the funeral committee of Pan Martyr at 8:00 AM yesterday to discuss donations and public memorial methods. Wu Huanwen, Hong Liehun, Ni Huaixin, Zhong Zhixiang, Xie Yuhai, etc. were present. Wu Huanwen was elected as the chairman, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Please publicly elect the convener: (Resolution) Wu Huanwen, Hong Liehun, Ni Huaixin, Zhong Zhixiang, Xie Yuhai, etc. were publicly elected as the convener. (2) How should we help Pan Martyr, who was poor after his death?: (Resolution) A. Each person should contribute a funeral gift and donate as much as possible. B. Each person should do their best to gather scattered comrades and enthusiastically donate and participate. C. Please ask the funeral committee to include an advertisement to gather comrades to inform everyone. (3) How to participate in the funeral ceremony: (Resolution) Use the Zhifu ritual to show respect. Temporary motion: (1) Please ask the Assistance to Patriotic Martyrs Committee to save waste and give substantial benefits to the family: (Resolution) Send a letter to the Assistance to Patriotic Martyrs Committee to pay attention. (2) The Citizens' Daily and the National Goods Movement Newspaper will publish special editions on the 11th of this month. Please ask comrades to contribute articles enthusiastically: (Resolution) Passed. (3) The public memorial will be held at 2:00 PM on November 10th: (Resolution) Passed. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Donations Liu Chunshan has been broadcasting on the Huaxing Radio Station for days to encourage donations from all circles. The donors have become more and more enthusiastic. Yesterday, the following donations were received: (1) Xu's laundry old lady, eight jiao; (2) female worker Song Jinmei, three jiao and two fen; (3) elementary school student Qu Zongjun's saved candy money, one yuan; (4) eight-year-old Zhao Yuanyuan, two jiao and eighteen copper coins.

<p>Broadcasting Propaganda Wu Zhihao, general manager of the Shanghai National Goods Company across from the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road, and manager Lu Qisheng have always held the purpose of saving the country. Therefore, the company sells various daily national goods at low prices to promote sales. It is learned that Wu and Lu deeply regret the passing of Patriot Bo Hongsheng and are especially saddened by the family's cries for food. They invited the famous Shanghai comedian Liu Chunshan and others to broadcast the deeds of Pan Martyr on the Huaxing Radio Station and plead for the family, hoping that all ladies and gentlemen will uphold their patriotic enthusiasm and generously donate to help.</p>

<p>Venue: New Municipal Government Auditorium in the city center</p>
<p>The Social Bureau noted that previous chrysanthemum exhibitions held in the city have been very popular, with enthusiastic participation from various public and private gardens, and have attracted public attention. Therefore, the Bureau decided to expand the exhibition into a horticultural exhibition, where all kinds of flowers, trees, fruits, vegetables, and other products, equipment, charts, and books related to horticulture can be displayed. In addition to the supply of a large number of new and famous chrysanthemums and various rare horticultural flowers and trees by the garden, the Bureau is also widely soliciting and collecting horticultural masterpieces from various public and private gardens and firms to be displayed together in public. The Bureau also plans to invite experts to contribute their planting, preparation, storage, and sales techniques to allow visitors to appreciate, learn from, study, and imitate each other to improve varieties and increase production. Currently, an organizing committee is being formed, with President Wu Xingya and Preparatory Director Bao Bodu actively making preparations. The Bureau is drafting the articles of association and formulating the solicitation methods, which will be sent to all exhibitors on the mornings of November 12th and 13th from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and the afternoons from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The items should be delivered to the Second Section of the Social Bureau in the city center. The Bureau will send staff to count the items and issue receipts. On the mornings of November 19th from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and the afternoons from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, the exhibitors should bring their receipts to the Bureau to collect the items and complete the procedures.

The Bureau is also soliciting poems and inscriptions to commend the exhibitors and sending letters to various organizations to solicit prizes for awarding separately. In order to facilitate the appreciation and viewing of various buildings and facilities in the city center by all circles, and to promote the concept of revitalizing the city center, the municipal government has approved the use of the New Municipal Government Auditorium in the city center as the venue for the exhibition. The dates for the exhibition are scheduled from November 15th to 18th. Visitors can take public buses No. 4 and 5 from the Baoshan Road intersection to reach the venue directly.</p>

<p>Gao Xiaohe, the warden of the detention center of the Second Special District Local Court of Shanghai, was accused by a detainee to the Ministry of Judicial Administration in the summer of this year for corruption and abuse of prisoners. The Ministry ordered the Gao Third Branch Court to send someone to investigate, but the matter was dropped due to lack of evidence. Not long after, three detainees, Xue Zhenyi (sentenced to seven years for attempted murder), Chen Fuliang (originally sentenced to two months for blackmailing and pimping, fined 200 yuan, but the sentence was changed to one year on appeal), and Yang Liusheng (sentenced to eight months for forgery), who were appealing their cases and detained in the detention center, jointly filed a complaint against Warden Gao Xiaohe and Director Cai Qinquan for embezzling food rations, engaging in favoritism and corruption, abusing prisoners, and providing poor treatment, among other things. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Shouyi of the Higher Third Branch Court, together with Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, signed a warrant to bring the three criminals to court for a secret investigation to determine the accuracy of the allegations. We will inquire and report in detail later.</p>

<p>Tragedy discovered after fire was extinguished</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 4:30 PM, a fire suddenly broke out at the residence of a certain family at No. 638 Ren Zhi Lane, Wuchang Road, North Sichuan Road, due to carelessness.

Neighbors also hurriedly carried their boxes and baskets and fled in a hurry. Fortunately, the Hongkou Fire Brigade learned of the fire and quickly drove fire trucks to put it out. It was completely extinguished at about 1:00 PM. However, when inspecting the scene, a seven-year-old girl was suddenly found burned to death, a tragic sight. It is believed that she was knocked down by the smoke after the fire broke out, leading to this tragedy. The police are still investigating the cause of the fire.</p>

<p>Qingtian People Scammed While Seeking Livelihood</p>
<p>Police Requested to Pursue and Arrest</p>
<p>Xiang Zefei, Chen Fanglin, Wu Meifa, Liu Zhenxing, Chen Yanhan, Zhou Ronglu, and others from Qingtian, Zhejiang Province, faced bankruptcy in their rural areas and lacked means to make a living. They planned to go abroad to do business and reluctantly scraped together 300 to 400 yuan each for travel expenses and passports. They entrusted a fellow townsman, Yang Zinan, to handle the matter. Xiang and the others then came to Shanghai from their hometowns and stayed at the Wu Tongchun Inn on Danfeng Road in the Nanshi district. They agreed with Yang to pay 400 yuan each, promising that they could go abroad within a month after payment. Unexpectedly, Xiang and the others waited in Shanghai for over a month without any news. When they inquired with Yang, Yang claimed that those going to countries like Austria and Germany had to go through Haiwei and enter via Siberia. Xiang and the others were going abroad for the first time and obeyed Yang's instructions, so they dared not offend him. However, after waiting another half month, there was still no news. Living in Shanghai was quite expensive, so they agreed with Yang to temporarily return to their hometowns and come to Shanghai again after the passports were processed. Who knew that after returning home for over a month, there was still no news? They came to Shanghai a few days ago to meet with Yang, but Yang only gave them a Tianjin boat ticket. When they questioned him about the passport, he said to pick it up in Haishenwai. Seeing that Yang's words were evasive and that it was not a Haishenwai boat ticket, Xiang and the others feared being trafficked as coolies. They were about to hand Yang over to the local police station, but Yang was alert and escaped. The six of them presented a list of the defrauded funds to the Yimiao Police Station a few days ago, requesting that they be strictly pursued, arrested, and punished.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by his eldest son and secretary Zhou Bomin, and science expert Mr. Yang, he went to the China Educational Supplies Manufacturing Factory on Kunming Road for a visit. President Yu was one of the founders of the China Bookstore, so he had a deep connection with the factory. He was received by factory director Hu Tingmei and general manager Wu Gusheng, who guided him through the production process in various workshops. President Yu greatly appreciated the physical and chemical instruments and botanical and zoological specimen models for primary and secondary schools. He particularly admired the factory's creation of microscope slides and the invention of the self-ringing calendar clock. He stated that he would vigorously promote these products in the Northwest provinces to aid the development of culture in the Northwest. After the visit, he personally inscribed a plaque to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<p>Young Customer Goes to Question Her</p>
<p>Police Search and Arrest the Assailant</p>
<p>At around 11 PM last night, a middle-aged man dressed in fine clothes and wearing glasses went to the Pear Blossom Brothel at No. 8, Lane 1, Fuxiang Li, Guangxi Road, for entertainment. It is said that he was acquainted with Pear Blossom Girl (Zhang Sujuan, 17 years old, from Lujiabang, Kunshan County) in the brothel and had been intimate with her. He had recently heard that the girl had taken another lover, so he went to question her. Unexpectedly, they disagreed, and the customer pulled out a self-defense pistol, firing a shot at the girl's leg before fleeing. After being shot, the girl fell to the ground and cried for help. The patrolling police arrived upon hearing the commotion, but the assailant had already fled. They immediately notified the fire department to send an ambulance to take her to the hospital. As the injury was to her leg, it was not serious. As for the customer's name, it was later learned that it was Chen Xin, who works at the Yifeng Enamel Factory. One theory is that Chen was drunk and playing with the gun, causing the accident. After sending detectives to investigate, the police are searching for the assailant and have reportedly apprehended him.</p>

<p>Ms. Wang, whose given name is Zhifen, wife of Li Shilin, a local resident of No. 24, Shangxianfang, Xiafei Road, French Concession, was in her seventh month of pregnancy on June 29th of this year. Li sent her to the Shangxian Hall Maternity Hospital behind Shangxianfang to await delivery. She gave birth to a son that day. Unexpectedly, three days later, the mother suddenly developed puerperal fever. As the hospital did not treat her, she was immediately taken home, where she died after doctors were called in for treatment but were ineffective. Later, Li Shilin believed that the hospital had been negligent in their duties and hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zhang Xiangwen, the hospital's director, Ge Chenghui, a doctor, and Gu Qin, the head nurse, of negligence in their duties, resulting in death due to negligence, and requesting that they be interrogated and punished according to the law. After receiving the complaint, Judge Wang Gangxu repeatedly held court sessions, summoning both parties for questioning, and requested the Chinese Medical Association to conduct an appraisal. The debate was declared closed, and a date was set for the verdict. The previous reports have chronicled each of these events. Yesterday afternoon was the date set for the verdict in the case. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, arrived at the court to await instructions. At 2:45 PM, Judge Wang announced the verdict in the criminal court, stating that Zhang Xiangwen, Ge Chenghui, and Gu Qin were all found not guilty. It is faintly heard that the plaintiff expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and will file an appeal after receiving the judgment.</p>

<p>Hundreds Already Caught</p>
<p>Stray dogs are rampant in various cities and towns along the Pudong coast. During the day, they roam the streets, competing for scraps from various households, and at night, they sleep anywhere. When people in uniform pass by, they bark madly. A supervisor from the Municipal Public Security Bureau was surrounded by stray dogs several times while inspecting Pudong at night. These dogs, especially the mange-ridden ones, are extremely foul and smelly. In view of this, the Municipal Health Bureau, for the sake of a permanent solution, hired dozens of workers to bring dog-catching vehicles to various parts of Pudong. Due to their skillful operations, the stray dogs were caught without exception. The results have been excellent in recent days. Combining the catches from various locations, no fewer than several hundred have been caught.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Letter from the French Concession Taxpayers' Association to the French Municipal Council <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Increased Tax on Jushenyee Sauce Garden</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the French Municipal Council yesterday, stating: We respectfully inform you that we received a letter from the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, stating that Jushenyee Sauce Garden, a member business located at No. 187 Sapo Sai Road, reported that in addition to operating a sauce business, they also sell Shaoxing wine. They pay property tax in accordance with the regulations of the French Municipal Council and have obtained a business license. They also pay a monthly wine tax of 2.80 yuan. They have been operating for many years without any problems. Unexpectedly, on August 16th of this year, they suddenly received a notice from the French Public Works Bureau tax collector, stating that starting from September, the wine tax should be increased by 4.20 yuan, for a total of 7 yuan, which is shocking. Upon investigation, wine tax is levied in three grades. Our business is an example of the second grade, paying 2.80 yuan per month. The tax amount has never been changed or increased since the business was established. The sale of Shaoxing wine is a side business, and the scope of business is small. In this time of economic recession, all businesses are struggling to survive. Therefore, although our business also sells Shaoxing wine, there is actually no business. It can be proven through on-site investigation. Now, the bureau ignores the difficulties of businesses and suddenly proposes to increase taxes by a large amount, which is really difficult to bear. Therefore, we specifically request your council to uphold justice and negotiate with the French Public Works Bureau to cancel the increased tax in order to maintain business. Based on this, since the business has not expanded or changed the tax amount, how can the tax be increased? In this autumn of economic decline, it is especially not the time to increase taxes. In addition to sending a separate letter to the French Public Works Bureau requesting the cancellation of the increased tax, we hereby forward the situation to your council for assistance, requesting that you promptly forward a letter to the French Public Works Bureau to maintain the original tax in order to maintain business.</p>

<p>Three Robbers Escape with Plunder</p>
<p>Police Detectives Arrive, Robbers Long Gone</p>
<p>At about 9:10 AM yesterday, three robbers suddenly came to the home of Xiao Yimin at No. 31, Qishan Village, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. One was wearing a navy blue suit, a gray woolen coat, and a bowler hat; another was wearing a gray suit; and the third was wearing a long robe. All spoke the local dialect. Each held a pistol. After entering, they immediately closed the front door and confined the family members to one room. Then, they began to rummage through boxes and cabinets, looting calmly. For about two hours, they stole a savings passbook from the Bank of China with 3,000 yuan, a gold ring inlaid with a ruby, a pearl bracelet, a diamond ring, a pearl ear pick, and two gold treasure rings. After obtaining the loot, they escaped calmly.

<p>Having read your newspaper's report yesterday about the dispute over medical expenses between patient Pan Jintao and our hospital on Pushi Road, we have found that it does not match the facts at the time. According to the hospital records, Mr. Pan suffered from cerebral hemorrhage, i.e., stroke. When it occurred and he fell to the ground, Mr. Pan's wife was not in the store. The group helped him to his feet and waited approximately half an hour, and only then was the hospital called for a consultation. When the director of our hospital arrived in person to diagnose and examine, Pan was already unconscious, had a feeble pulse and barely could feel it, and his breathing was on the verge of ceasing altogether. Our Doctor Gu therefore said that he could not be saved, but the shop attendants repeatedly begged to be saved. Doctor Gu therefore generously administered two Coramine injections, in the hope of saving his life for one out of ten thousand chances, but due to the excessive delay, he could not be saved and died. Coramine is considered a harmless and useful agent by doctors of all countries. The patient's family tried to deny our hospital's consultation fees and medical expenses, listening to the plan of a neighbor, who reported to the police station, saying that the injection administered by our Doctor Gu contained a toxic substance. Subsequently, the police station delivered the empty injection vial to the forensic doctor for inspection. On the previous day, after a detailed inspection by prosecutor Wang Ren and the two forensic doctors Wei and Jiang, they determined that Pan Jintao had died due to acute illness and that Doctor Gu was not at fault. The report stated that after the injection, the patient was still able to shout once, etc., but the hospital found that the contents are nothing more than hearsay and untrue. In the hospital's sincere concern, such that all sides may know the real truth, rumors were spreading, and the name and reputation of our hospital were damaged, this special letter would like to correct this, and we request that you print this as well. Best wishes, Shude Hospital, November 8.</p>

<p>Road Construction: In the years of the Republic of China 11, the Committee had already begun road construction plans. In the 12th year, it built the motor road from Xiangtan to Baoqing in Hunan Province, which was truly the beginning of promoting the national highway movement. The Committee continued to carry out this road construction project. Taking Guizhou Province as an example, there were no smooth highways by the end of the 15th year of the Republic. In the winter of the 16th year, the Committee cooperated with the Guizhou Provincial Government, employing 100,000 workers to build a model motor road of 500 miles, which was convenient for the people. From September of the 20th year of the Republic to March of the 21st year, the Committee undertook the construction of the highway between Xi'an and Lanzhou, with a total length of 480 miles, converting the original main road into a motor road, using 500,000 yuan (of which 200,000 yuan was allocated by the National Economic Council). All seven steep mountain ridges were leveled with explosives and manual labor, so that the two major cities in the Northwest were connected to each other. At the same time, many culverts and bridges were built. The Committee also built roads on Liupan Mountain in Gansu. The top of the mountain is about 9,000 feet above sea level, and the slope of the road built by the Committee is no more than 7%. It used to take 18 days to travel this road, but now it only takes three or four days by car. Since its establishment, the Committee has opened up 1,993 miles of new roads and repaired 1,296 miles of old roads in fourteen provinces.</p>
<p>Irrigation Projects: The Shilu Canal, ten miles west of Beiping in Hebei Province, was the first irrigation project undertaken by the Committee. It was completed in the 17th year of the Republic, with a cost of 134,040 yuan, so that 70,000 acres of semi-dry farmland in Hebei Province could be irrigated by the Yongding River. During the severe drought from the 17th to the 18th years of the Republic, the Committee's Engineering Department engaged in large-scale irrigation work, using 800,000 yuan to allow the water of the Yellow River to irrigate 1.2 million mu of farmland in Sa County, Suiyuan Province. This is the achievement of the Minsheng Canal. Although the canal was not completely successful, the Committee had a complete plan, so the central government paid great attention to it and has already sent personnel to take over the work to complete the unfinished task. The Jinghui Canal, jointly operated by the Committee and the Shaanxi Provincial Government, cost 1.3 million yuan, of which 750,000 yuan was donated by the Committee. The farmland that has been irrigated has been extremely productive, and land prices have increased accordingly. However, there are many projects that need to be developed in Shaanxi, and the provincial government still hopes for the Committee's assistance.</p>
<p>Future Work and Opportunities: (1) The most important thing the Committee is paying attention to today is the Fen River Diversion Project in Shanxi Province. Surveying has been underway for a year and a half, and the field work has been completed. The surveying and printing of reports cost a total of 100,000 yuan, all paid by Shanxi Province. Furthermore, this surveying includes four rivers outside the Fen River. According to the plan of the Committee's Engineering Department, the Fen River alone requires 1.27 billion yuan, of which 800 million yuan is for disaster prevention and 470 million yuan is for dredging. In this way, even in the event of severe drought, there is no fear of lack of water, and annual production can be increased. If this plan can be implemented, Shanxi Province will see countless benefits, and the livelihoods of 20 million people can be improved.</p>
<p>(2) In the lower reaches of the Yellow River between Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, hydropower can be used for grinding and electricity generation to develop industries. The Committee is currently studying and designing this, and the report will be published this autumn.</p>
<p>(3) Developing the Hetao area west of Baotou requires a surveying fee of 40,000 yuan. If this plan can be implemented, 6 million mu of farmland can be irrigated, and the benefits will be endless.</p>
<p>(4) There are many other river courses whose situations are not yet known, and they all have great value for urgent research, in order to start construction as soon as possible for the benefit of the people. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Opening of the Third Shanghai Middle School Joint Sports Meet Causes a Sensation in Xujiahui <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The audience reached over 15,000 people</p>
<p>Two records broken in yesterday's four finals</p>
<p>Continues at 1 PM this afternoon</p>
<p>The third Middle School Sports Meet was held yesterday at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui. Twenty-seven schools participated in the track and field events, thirty-seven schools in the group exercises, and the maneuvers reached a total of more than 2,700 people. Although the venue is located in the western corner of Shanghai, the number of spectators who took time to watch was no less than the grand occasion at Rue du Père Robert. The meeting opened at 1 PM yesterday, with Director Pan delivering the opening speech and Chu Minyi making a special trip to the meeting to deliver a speech. The preliminary rounds of 50 meters, 100 meters, and the men's 400 meters for both male and female groups were all held yesterday. The finals completed four events: men's Group A shot put, men's Group B high jump, and women's Group A and B long jump. Guan Hongda of Zhengfeng Middle School in men's Group A shot put and Rong Shujian of Aiguo Girls' School and Zhu Yanqing of Wusong in women's Group B long jump broke the previous records. The men's high hurdles and 1,500-meter preliminary round were postponed to today due to insufficient time yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The main entrance of the entire venue is on Gordon Road. The order inside the venue was maintained by Nanyang Model Middle School and the Home Guard. Yesterday the weather was clear and sunny, and the athletes from each school were full of energy. The north, south, and east sides of the venue were the seating areas for each school, and various flags fluttered in the wind, dazzlingly. The rostrum was set up on the east side of the venue, displaying various prizes, which were dazzling and beautiful. On the left and right sides of the rostrum, there was a pair of antithetical couplets: "Defending the country ultimately depends on youth; Creating heroes depends on the times; Merit lies in repeated efforts," and "Advocating martial arts to strengthen the Chinese race; Sharpening the spirit through sports; The spirit inspires all people." The athletes from each school wore different uniforms with beautiful styles. The Jiaotong University track and field venue is large, but the surrounding space is relatively small, causing overcrowding of spectators and making it difficult to maintain order.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>At 1 PM, the opening ceremony was held. The track and field athletes from each school lined up in front of the track in front of the stage in order, led by the Public Security Bureau military band, followed by the meeting officials, then the female school athletes, and finally the male school athletes. They circled the field once in the melodious sound of military music, then stood in front of the stage and performed the ceremony. First, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered the opening speech, and also delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu. Then, Yu Zhongbiao, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, Chu Minyi, the honorary advisor, and Li Zhaohuan delivered speeches in succession. Then the music was played and the ceremony was completed. The sports meeting song was sung under the guidance of Zhong Zitou, and then the students from each school entered the field for the maneuvers, with Shao Rugan giving the order and Shen Xian demonstrating.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Pan Gongzhan's opening speech briefly stated that the significance of promoting sports at the opening of today's Third Middle School Sports Meet is not for a small number of students to compete for championships, but to encourage all students to pay attention to the dangers facing the country and the nation, and to build a good foundation for the future of the nation by strengthening their bodies. Seventy-one schools and 909 athletes participated in this year's track and field competition. More than 30 schools and 37 sections participated in group exercises, and 35 schools and 2,700 people participated in the maneuvers. Four girls' physical education schools and 45 athletes participated in the performance, which is more than in previous years. It is hoped that it will progress year by year in the future, so that physical education can be popularized to all students in the school.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu's Speech: Mr. Chu Minyi's speech briefly stated that he was very happy to participate in the third Shanghai Middle School Joint Sports Meet today. Chinese sports have gradually developed in recent years, and sports meets are held everywhere. However, the meaning of the sports meet is not to train a small number of athletes, but to enable every student to participate in sports, and to extend it beyond the school so that everyone can pay attention to physical education. Middle school students are in the period of proper physical development. If they are not trained during the middle school period, they will develop bad habits. Therefore, the significance of the middle school sports meet is even more important. In this time of national crisis, everyone should pay special attention to physical education. Intellectual and moral education must be developed from physical education. It is hoped that everyone will work harder.</p>

<p>Finals Sketches</p>
<p>Men's Group A Shot Put: Among the field event finals yesterday, the men's Group A shot put competition was the most intense, with as many as 35 participants. It was eliminated to six people: Jiang Qing, Shu Changge, Wang Xialing, Guan Hongda, Huang Longhuan, and Huang Qihou, and the competition was particularly fierce. As a result, Guan Hongda, the big fat man from Zhengfeng, won first place with a score of 11.84 meters, breaking the record of 11.51 meters held by Xie Quanhe. Shu Changge of Fudan was 10.895 meters, and Jiang Qing of Guanghua was 10.845 meters, with little difference.</p>
<p>Men's Group B High Jump: Only a dozen people participated in the men's Group B high jump. Wu Chanshen of Minli won first place with 1.48 meters. Although the score was poor, the jumping posture was beautiful. If he is trained, he can also be a talent. Song Wuchang of Fudan was second with 1.44 meters, Shi Sanyong of Hudong was third with 1.41 meters, and Liu Demian of Yangjing was fourth with 1.35 meters.</p>
<p>Women's Group A Long Jump: In this women's Group A event, there has been no successor talent besides Qian Hangsu and Chen Baixue. Wu Meixian of Fudan has also retired into secrecy, and the talent is becoming increasingly scarce. This year is particularly desolate. "There are no great generals in Shu, and Liao Hua is the vanguard." Tan Shangzhen of Wuben only took the top spot with a score of 3.93 meters, which is much inferior to Zhang Pingxian's 4.30 meters.</p>
<p>Women's Group B Long Jump: Rong Shujian of Aiguo Girls' School won first place in the women's long jump Group B, and Zhu Yanchun of Wusong was light and soft, and their legs were very powerful. The scores of the two were the same at 3.81 meters. When the final ranking was determined, Rong Shujian jumped 4.05 meters, exceeding the Group A score. Zhu Yanchun also increased to 3.90 meters, but unfortunately it could not be recorded as an official record.</p>
<p>Preliminary Round Observations</p>
<p>There were six preliminary rounds yesterday, but due to the darkness of the weather, they could not be held one by one temporarily. The high hurdles and 1,500 meters were changed to be held today. In the 100 meters men's Group A, Li Songnian of Daxia took the lead as soon as he started. Zhu Songsheng of Fudan has a lot of sprinting power and is considered a rising star. This item became 11 seconds 8, which is more brilliant than Dong Yinchu's 12 seconds 2 from Guanghua. Others, such as Ye Haiye and Ye Haitao of Shangzhong's 12 seconds, and Chen Yongfu of Qingqing's 12 seconds 1, are all considerable achievements. In the fifth group of men's Group B, Tang Xianglin of Shangzhong won a good record of 12 seconds 4 with a smooth start, overturning the old record of 13 seconds, which is not easy. This public posture running is very experienced, and it is expected that he will have the opportunity to grab a position in both the semi-finals. Jiang Zhenhua of Daxia is big and fast, and won the first seat with 12 seconds 5 in the first group. The performance of the women's middle school Group A 100 meters is not good. There are a total of four groups, all hovering outside of 9 seconds. It is true that Xiao Jieying, a famous general from Wuben, and Li Keling, a newcomer from Nanyang, failed to join due to circumstances, so all four group leaders belonged to Ai Qun Tianxia, which can also be said to be a dark horse.</p>

<p>50 Meters: The scores of the women's 50 meters, Group A, B, and physical education schools were all average. Except for Chen Zaichun of Southeast Physical Education School with 8.5 seconds, the rest exceeded 9 seconds, which is not as good as the elementary school sports meet. It is true that Li Keling of Nanyang Business School failed to participate, and there was a lack of a strong player. Shen Yan of Huadong Middle School participated in the Jiangsu Provincial Sports Meet and scored around 8 seconds. This time, she started too late and fell to fourth place, which was a pity.</p>
<p>100 Meters: Li Songnian of Daxia is still extraordinary in the men's 100 meters Group A, with a score of 11 seconds 8. Others, such as Ye Haitao of Private Shangzhong and Chen Yongfu of Yuqing Middle School, are also quite weak, and must gain a place in the final. Cai Zhenhua of Daxia is the best in Group B. Shi Ouqing of Huadong Women's School is definitely the champion in the women's Group A final. Deng Guoxian of Wuben in Group B should not be underestimated, and Zhang Minzhi of Aiguo must be extra careful.</p>
<p>400 Meters: Yesterday's men's Groups A and B 400-meter preliminary round was originally one of the most exciting scenes, but it was held in the hazy spring, and the audience gradually decreased. Chen Mingliang of Kaiming in Group A and Chen Yexing of Guanghua in Group B had the best scores.</p>
<p>Group Performance</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the conference, and there were as many as thirteen group exercise performances from various schools. Among them, the apparatus exercises, high benches, Arhats, stilt gymnastics, and wrestling of Chengzhong Middle School were the most neat, lively, skilled, and beautiful. However, it was felt that it was too rigid and did not seem to be very consistent with the principles of physical education. The "Our Daily Morning Exercises" of Jingye Middle School were consistent in action and full of spirit, which showed the diligence of daily practice. The apparatus exercises of the Aiguo Sports Normal School had few participants, but each person was proficient in the exercises. Other exercises, such as the dumbbell exercises of Minli Middle School, the alert games of Wusong Middle School, the group exercises of New Asia, the fitness exercises of Chengdong, and the Yanqing boxing of Yangjing, were also quite lively and pleasing, and won a lot of applause.</p>

<p>Meeting Highlights</p>
<p>More than 3,000 people participated in the maneuvers: Yesterday was the first day of the opening, and the conference specially held maneuvers. More than 3,000 male and female students from various participating schools were arranged in order, and the order was well-organized. The actions were neat and beautiful, and the spirit was particularly full, making it the most impressive part of the conference.</p>
<p>Poor Order, Attention from Various Schools: Yesterday, when the various track and field spring events began, the athletes from various schools ran around the field. Although the Home Guard and Boy Scouts tried their best to maintain order, it was not effective. It is hoped that the physical education teachers of each school will pay special attention today, advise the students, and not run around again, so as not to hinder the view.</p>
<p>Tearful Eyes Looking at Failure: During the women's Group A 50-meter preliminary round, Shen Yan, a strong player from Huadong Girls' School, did not start after the gun was fired, and it was too late to catch up afterwards, and she finally failed. She couldn't help but cry bitterly, which was a pity.</p>
<p>The Sports Queen is Absent for Filming: Li Keling of Nanyang High School of Commerce originally participated in the 50-meter and 100-meter events, and her results were quite good. However, she went to Suzhou with Lianhua Film Company to film, and did not have time to participate. Nanyang's strength was inevitably affected, and the general movie fans were even more disappointed.</p>
<p>Guan the Fat Man is Not Alone: Guan Hongda of Zhengfeng Middle School won the men's Group A shot put championship yesterday. Guan is tall and burly, and weighs more than 250 pounds. His obesity is similar to that of the American shot put master Deng who recently came to Shanghai to perform. Yesterday Guan became the focus of attention and the camera, and it can be said that he was not alone.</p>
<h3 id="e173">A Small Practice Should Be Done Before the Game <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>To Activate Blood and Muscles</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first game of the new winter, and the weather was cold, and the general results were not outstanding enough to satisfy the public. The reason for the decrease in color is that the players did not do exercises to activate the blood and muscles before starting the race, which is a serious problem. Not only is this true for track events, but also for field events. Therefore, in this early cold weather, they could not fully display their skills. It is hoped that the male and female athletes and instructors who will appear today will pay attention to this, which will help with the results.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Defeated Datong with a Score of 48 to 32</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Yunfei Basketball Team first defeated Jiaotong University, then defeated Mailing. Last night, by appointment, they competed against Datong University at Datong. At the start, Datong showed vigor and took the lead with a score of 4 to 3. Yunfei quickly rallied, with Liang and Chen scoring almost every shot, taking a commanding lead of 16 to 6. Unexpectedly, Datong did not show any weakness and pressed forward, scoring five consecutive goals, tying the score at 16 to 16. The first half ended with this tie. In the second half, the teams remained evenly matched for a short time. Yunfei then connected passes smoothly and scored continuously, soaring ahead. At this point, Datong struggled to keep up and appeared outmatched. The final score was 48 to 32, with Yunfei emerging victorious. The referee was Sun Hebin. Furthermore, the Yunfei team plans to schedule a match against Shanghai University next Thursday at 6 PM. They hope Shanghai University will contact their team.</p>

<p>Tu Kaiyuan Goes Abroad Again: Mr. Tu Kaiyuan, a famous soccer player, previously studied in Germany for ten years and obtained a medical doctorate. After returning to China, he practiced at Jicheng Pharmacy for many years. However, Mr. Tu is still not satisfied and plans to further his studies. He is scheduled to travel to Europe again on the 13th via the Italian ship Coute Rosso, specializing in orthopedic surgery. Dr. Tu is usually very enthusiastic about sports, so during this trip to Germany, he will also deeply research all aspects of sports-related health facilities. When he returns to China after completing his studies, it will not only be fortunate for our sports community but also a blessing for society.</p>
<p>Xinji Football Team Reorganized: The Xinji Football Team, since its establishment last year, has had Mr. Tu Kaiyuan as its honorary advisor, enthusiastically coaching and sparing no effort. Although Mr. Tu was injured last time while representing the Chinese team against the Jewish team, he still instructed on the field despite his injury. After the Chinese Football Field was returned, practice was suspended due to the lack of a field. However, it is currently being reorganized and efforts are being made to borrow a field for practice. All members of the Xinyao team must register before the 10th, otherwise, new team members will be added.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Review Meeting on Methods for Repairing the Confucius Temple and Forest <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Expressed Dissent on Adding a Surcharge to Diplomas</p>
<p>In order to commemorate Confucius, the central government has resolved to repair the Confucius Temple and Forest in Qufu. The central government will provide a one-time subsidy of 200,000 yuan for repairs. The remaining funds are planned to be raised through two types of apportionment methods: (1) A surcharge will be added to the diplomas of students in universities, colleges, and schools: one yuan for each graduation certificate from specialized schools and above, five jiao for high school, two jiao for junior high school, and five fen for primary school; (2) The apportionment method for the tomb of Sun Yat-sen will be followed, with each provincial government being apportioned 260,000 yuan for large provinces, 150,000 yuan for medium-sized provinces, and 50,000 yuan for poor and small provinces. The resolution on this apportionment method was submitted to the Executive Yuan to order the Ministries of Interior, Education, and Finance to consult and verify before submitting it to the central government for a decision. At 9 AM the day before yesterday, the Executive Yuan convened representatives from the three ministries to meet at the Yuan to review the plan for repairing the Confucius Temple and Forest. Lu Xirong from the Ministry of Interior, Zhang Jiong from the Ministry of Education, and He Yimin from the Ministry of Finance attended, along with Teng Gu and Liang Dong from the Executive Yuan. Representative Zhang Jiong from the Ministry of Education reported on the difficulties of adding a surcharge to student graduation certificates and expressed dissent. The reasons were: (1) It is a form of arbitrary taxation and miscellaneous charges; (2) According to current statistics on the number of graduates from universities, colleges, and schools, only over 190,000 yuan can be collected annually, and it must be collected by local educational administrative agencies. The amount is small and sufficient to affect the efficiency of educational administration. Therefore, it was decided on the spot, "Regarding the cost of repairing the Confucius Temple and Forest, an estimated budget should first be prepared based on actual needs, and then an apportionment method should be proposed based on the number required in the estimated budget. The central government should first hire architectural experts to go to Qufu with representatives from the Shandong Provincial Government to conduct a survey, make accurate estimates, and construct in phases according to their urgency, prepare an estimated budget, and then discuss the apportionment method according to actual needs."</p>

<p>Chapter Four: A Cup of Water Reveals the Difficulty of Seeking Help; A Poor Worker Protects the Elderly; Ten Thousand Gold Can Be Obtained; A Cunning Official Forms a Group</p>
<p>These conversations were quietly overheard for a long time under the eaves by Zhang Jiefu and Li Shilian. Some of the words were heard very clearly. Some of the words were not very clear. However, the waiter's last words that the girl was also a pitiful person, and what Zhiqian said about you being a matchmaker, were all heard word for word. It was also said that the old worker would bring something to the girl. Zhang Jiefu whispered to Li Shilian with a smile: He wants to marry that girl, and he is very qualified, only he has that spare money. Li Shilian said: That's natural, the eyes of the people in the world are all bright. He sees that the person is someone who interacts with the director of the hall and the provincial committee, so naturally he wants to curry favor in that direction. Zhang Jiefu said: Mr. Li's letters, have they all been sent? I think you are a shrewd and capable person, and your future must be very promising. When Li Shilian heard someone praising him, he looked very proud, raised his eyebrows, and smiled: That's hard to say. Zhang Jiefu saw his appearance, he was a little conceited, and he couldn't help feeling ashamed that he didn't have the confidence to find a job. He put his hands behind his back and wandered around under the eaves. Li Shilian thought, his attitude is saying that I am bragging. When I have a chance, I will show off to him. So he shouted: Waiter, come, hire me a rickshaw to the Ministry of Finance. When Zhang Jiefu heard this, he glared at him but didn't say anything. When the waiter heard that he was going to the Ministry of Finance, it seemed that he was also getting a little bit of noble air, and he answered with a very crisp voice. So Li Shilian went back to his room to put on a mandarin jacket, put on his hat, came out, nodded to Zhang Jiefu and said: See you later. Zhang Jiefu smiled: Are you going to see Director Qian at the Ministry of Finance? Li Shilian puffed out his chest, buttoned the buttons on his chest and said: I'm going to try my luck, but I'm not sure. With that, he flicked his sleeves and walked out the door. When he arrived at the gate, the rickshaw hired by the waiter was already waiting in front of the door. The rickshaw puller asked: Sir, are you going to the Ministry of Finance? Li Shilian looked back, and answered in a low voice: I'm not going to the Ministry of Finance, pull me to Nan Yuan Men to buy something. (60)</p>

<p>— By Yishi</p>
<p>By chance, I met several Western friends. Whenever we met, we always had a good time talking and laughing. Because they have lived in China for many years, they can speak Shanghai dialect fluently. From then on, I began to pay attention to their actions, and sometimes I tried to test their patriotic personality.</p>
<p>Once in the park, we met unexpectedly, what a joy! To be in such a poetic and picturesque garden, and to be able to talk and laugh with each other, is such an interesting thing?</p>
<p>"Yi, are there no people in your country?" The most mischievous one, named J.K., usually likes to joke with people, this time he asked me like this right away.</p>
<p>"Haha! J.K., you are too naughty, we have 450 million compatriots, how can there be no one?" I was very surprised, and at the same time I was wondering if what he said contained a sarcastic meaning.</p>
<p>"Sigh! Yi, you are lying again, there are obviously no people in your country."</p>
<p>... Silence, hesitation stirred in my heart.</p>
<p>"Hey! Let me ask you, can anyone in your country manufacture weapons?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Can anyone in your country manufacture trains?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Can anyone in your country manufacture airplanes?"</p>
<p>"No." (The fourth one is still no)</p>
<p>"Then isn't there no one in your country?"</p>
<p>"Um..."</p>
<p>At that time, after hearing these words, my chest was filled with boundless grief and indignation, and I felt a burning sensation in my heart. Everyone was stunned for a while before parting.</p>
<p>Thank you to this friend for giving me an opportunity to reflect, and at the same time, I would like to encourage a group of passionate youths.</p>

<p>— (Qinfang)</p>
<p>I advise you not to be a philanthropist who gives away a single copper coin. You unintentionally encourage them to make begging a lifelong profession.</p>
<p>The chirping of crickets. It's like self-destructive heroes congratulating themselves. But now your end has come.</p>
<p>Sheep only need a rope to be tied together. The flock of sheep will follow. Even in the midst of狂风巨浪, people still cannot help each other.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Crab Proverbs <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>As someone living a school life, I certainly don't have the leisure to hold crabs and appreciate chrysanthemums, but our professor of Chinese studies often gives us essay topics related to crabs. The old man has written the character "crab" on the blackboard two or three times. Alas! Pitiful! Pitiful! My mouth doesn't eat crab, but my eyes see the character "crab" on the blackboard, wouldn't I be drooling three feet? The article of four or five hundred words is not yet finished, but it is dripping wet on half of the page! What is this? This is the drool left over when writing the essay.</p>
<p>Although the crab did not reach my mouth, what the Wu proverbs said about this character "crab" did provide me with a lot of humorous material. Crab proverbs, such as "eat old crab," "crab hand," "beggars eat dead crabs, all are good," "lotus leaf wraps crab, the more it wraps, the more it isn't," these are the warnings against whoring, gambling, and eating. A young man loses himself to a lascivious woman, called "eating old crab," is the harm of liking prostitution. The surgery for getting a winning hand is not good, every bet is bound to lose, called "crab hand," is the harm of gambling. Being greedy and insatiable, regardless of hygiene, called "beggars eat dead crabs, all are good," is the harm of liking to eat. Specially seeking outward beauty, inevitably exposing the content, called "lotus leaf wraps crab, the more it wraps, the more it isn't," is the harm of liking to dress up.</p>
<p>Others, laboring in vain, called "cow eats crab," being at a loss, called "footless crab belly," going from bad to worse, called "one crab is worse than another," running errands for others, called "shrimp soldiers and crab generals," all the Wu proverbs that mention this character "crab" mostly have negative connotations and no praise. Only one sentence, "摸摸 a big crab out of a small hole," can encourage us young students. Now burying ourselves in hard work, the knowledge we gain may be small, but as long as we concentrate and persevere, we will eventually achieve great things. For example, we are studying engineering, and in the future, we will make a great contribution to engineering. Isn't this "摸摸 a big crab out of a small hole?" Thinking of this, I dare not let my appetite hinder my studies, and the saliva flowing on the paper gradually dries up.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: The Palace Courtyards of Shengjing</p>
<p>Although we had arrived in Fengtian that day, after several days of long journeys, people were so tired that they were speechless. Everyone was hoping to rest as soon as possible. No matter how magnificent and moving the palace courtyards of Shengjing were, no one had the energy to carefully examine them. At most, we could only take a cursory glance, like riding a horse and looking at flowers, and consider that we had a considerable understanding of this new environment. Fortunately, we came today and do not plan to leave tomorrow. According to the Empress Dowager's estimate before departure, we plan to stay here for seven days. With seven days, it will be enough to wander around fully. But after tonight, everyone's energy will be fully restored, and tomorrow we can have a big stroll! I like strolling the most, I just can't wait to stroll today, but we who have official duties, how can we act freely? So I can only be patient and stroll again tomorrow.</p>
<p>But just wandering around these empty palace courtyards, can only know the surface of it. I can never be satisfied. I must find a way to know its history, and the history of everyone related to it, that is really interesting! However, very few people must know these histories. Among the many people who came with the Empress Dowager, maybe only one or two people can say a few words. And these one or two people—of course, Li Lianying and Qing Shan—are the roles that I am inconvenient or unwilling to approach too much. Even if I reluctantly ask them, they may not be able to give me a detailed answer. I think my father must be very clear, but he is not here at the moment. Then who else can I ask? Never mind, I am determined to try the Empress Dowager tomorrow. If I happen to catch her in a talkative mood, the result will definitely be very satisfactory! (170)</p>
<h3 id="e197">Seventeen Years Old <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>Sixteen years old is truly the most important turning point in life, because you embark on the road of light; or fall into the abyss of darkness, or even run into the grave, almost all of these steps are taken at sixteen.</p>
<p>Before sixteen years old, from the time you are born to sixteen years old, this period is spent laughing and jumping in the loving arms of your parents. Of course, you are well-fed, well-clothed, and everything is only pleasant, without worry, without suffering any blows, because worry or blows are borne by your parents. However, age will not allow you to always rely on your parents' arms. At the same time, the whip of life is also gradually being prepared to demonstrate to you as you get older. So at most by the age of sixteen, except for the sons of wealthy families, you will finally have to leave the loving arms of your parents and take your first step in life, embarking on your path of life.</p>
<p>Because it is the first step, it is the first step in your life in the world, you must not ignore its importance. What's more, the world in front of you is in a fierce battle where light and darkness have not yet been decided. At the same time, there are many monsters and snake spirits, moving around and harassing. They are all ghosts of darkness, they all stretch out their long claws, open their big mouths, to grab people and eat people. However, they all wear a mask, a tempting and anesthetizing mask, so it is not easy for people to see through, and instead they willingly walk into their circle, to fatten their teeth. As a result, they are victorious, but you are finished. However, is it okay for a person to end like this? Ending your life like this, how can you be worthy of yourself, worthy of your parents, and even more unworthy of society and the country! Therefore, if you want to give full play to the meaning of your life, you must pay special attention to your first step into the world. You should correct your intentions, be meticulous in your thinking, sharpen your vision, invigorate your spirit, and strive to fight against darkness, find the path of light and start walking.</p>
<p>Really, sixteen years old cannot be ignored at all, because that is when you will take your first step into the world.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Famous Cities All Have Many Beggars <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenlu</p>
<p>Those beggars in tattered clothes, who have just escaped from hell, are squeezed on the grand avenues that are like paradise, decorated with flowers and brocade. They not only destroy the beauty of the city, but also infringe on the public's time, hygiene, and the will for tranquility, etc., especially diminishing the international prestige of our country in places where Chinese and foreigners live together. We cannot sympathize with their situation and condone and tolerate them, allowing them to be natural.</p>
<p>The beggars on Nanjing Road are all rushing passers-by for money. Their targets are limited to passers-by, and they have not been seen bothering shopkeepers. Their purpose is cash. The usual mentality is that a copper coin is an obligation, and their main job is "rushing one"—in their jargon, called "rushing pigs," obviously a rogue's insulting term, not only making you lose money, but also treating you like livestock!</p>
<p>One of the beggars, about thirty years old, often half-opens and half-closes his eyes, and always has a short cigarette in the corner of his mouth. His face is mixed with the color of smoke and vegetables. He wears a short coat. This person has the most chances to be met. His characteristic is that he often seems to be closing his eyes to rest, but he can quickly catch up with you. At first glance, he chatters non-stop in a local accent. His voice is deliberately vague, but you can sometimes hear a word or two. Other beggars, when they are frustrated in their desires and discouraged, gradually move away and make defamatory remarks. This beggar, however, regardless of whether you are willing to give him money, sometimes starts chasing you and utters ugly and vicious words that can be heard. And regardless of whether you are male, female, old, or young, he dares to treat you all the same and chase and scold you. If the passers-by are women, he deliberately makes the vague voice clearer, so that people can recognize that in his scolding, there are also mixed with harassment, such as: "Grandma! Miss! Save me, this extremely poor person! You all abandon me!..." He probably relies on his dirty appearance and fallen status, expecting that people don't think it's worth arguing with him, or he is familiar with the public's psychology of enduring humiliation and bearing burdens, so he is so unscrupulous and accustomed to it!</p>
<p>There is also a female beggar, about forty years old, with a local accent. I remember that she seemed to have a pockmarked face. Her characteristic is that she can work hard at begging. She can chase you for a long distance, sparing no effort in her waist, feet, and mouth, until she gets the money. After she gets your giving, she meets you again in no time. It is understood that she has realized your generous nature, and she will definitely come to chase you again, even more closely, unless you repeatedly declare that you don't want to give any more. However, sometimes when she is chasing you and has not gained anything, if she finds that there is no hope on you after all, or if she suddenly encounters a passerby or a group of passersby who are more likely to give, she is also determined to give up on you and turn around to pursue others with a very familiar and brisk movement. I have seen her switching back and forth to chase several batches of benefactors in an instant, and the tone of her begging is also changing closely, which is interesting! I have also seen her several times搶搶before a group of poor people and demanding the leftover rice and vegetables from the rice carrier. She is really a hard worker in the begging industry, and can be called a "standard female beggar."</p>
<p>An elderly beggar, with a beard and a long shirt, has the appearance of an old gentleman. His accent, which is not easy to distinguish, is noisy in people's ears, which is too uncomfortable!</p>
<p>The three of them are permanent beggars on Nanjing Road, rain or shine, "Meeting you again at dusk." Their common point is to use tight chasing and annoying words, which are hated by people, as a means of obtaining copper coins—of course, they sometimes chase foreigners and strengthen their desires. When they are chasing, they must adopt the same speed as you. Closely following in your footsteps. In the dense crowd, if you accidentally encounter a special situation in front and your pace is hindered, their bodies will bump into you, or step on the heel of your shoe, or even rush in front of you—so, for the sake of being sensible, for the sake of conforming to the meaning of the word "chasing," they slow down, or retreat back, and restore the original state of walking and following, and their dirty bodies do not have to rub against your clothes very closely, which is impossible to avoid in a crowded environment. They have no disabilities, they have very strong foot strength and a very long speaking spirit, and they are willing to do this begging business of looking up to people. I think they must have understood the proverb "suffering for the sake of saving face," and are willing to "do the lowest business and earn the highest copper coins"; performing begging duties on Nanjing Road, the income should be considerable.</p>

<h3 id="e199">The Philosophy of the Lazy <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>Perhaps it is an external reason—the environment is like this, perhaps it is an internal reason—the disposition is like this, born with a skeptical temperament, plus a pair of lazy bones. From the time I was a child, some older people considered me an incomprehensible and hopeless waste, because the great truths they told me, I neither believed nor practiced, and finally I even ridiculed them. For example, once a private school teacher, Mr. Jia, was an opium smoker. Once he saw me, he was probably full of opium at the time, and suddenly said to me with great interest, "You are a young man. Young people should be ambitious. Why are you so lazy?" I unceremoniously said to him, "My laziness is just like your opium smoking. This is my hobby. Since you can smoke opium, can't I be lazy?" After speaking, I turned my head and left. Later, he never mentioned my laziness again when he saw me. Another time, a certain Mr. Yi, who was indulging in pornography, saw me, and he put on a solemn and respectable attitude and said to me, "You have become lazier and lazier lately. You should also love yourself!" I replied casually, "What don't I love myself? At least I still keep myself clean and don't go whoring to the point of rotting my nose." This touched a sore spot, and he became angry and scolded loudly, but he was still a little ashamed, so he had to withdraw himself. This method of dealing with people was effective, and I often used this method to deal with those who liked to lecture me. People also felt that I was a little difficult to deal with, even though I was lazy. When they saw me, they didn't dare to put on the attitude of a gentleman, and I saved myself a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Now that I am older, the degree of laziness is naturally deeper. However, I have recently understood some worldly ways. When friends kindly ask, "Why are you so lazy?" I am quite embarrassed to directly reprimand them, so I have to excuse myself by saying, "I am a person who is congenitally deficient and malnourished, so I have a lazy disease." But some insensitive friends still have to pursue it and say, "Looking at your face so ruddy and your body so strong, you don't look like a patient." I have no words to answer, even if I reluctantly say, "This is my philosophy of life." This myself also knows is deceiving, because lazy people have no philosophy at all. If lazy people have philosophy, they will not become lazy people, but will become philosophers. However, philosophers all advise people to be diligent and warn people against laziness. Have you ever seen a few philosophers praising laziness?</p>
<p>Unless it is like Ji Shuye of the Jin Dynasty who was decadent, naturally those who believe in Lao-Zhuang thought will praise laziness. The reason is that he himself is an extremely lazy person. In his Letter of Severance with Shan Juyuan (Tao), he said: "I was orphaned at a young age, and my mother and brothers spoiled me. I did not study the classics, and my nature was lazy. My muscles and flesh are relaxed, and my head and face are often not washed for fifteen days a month. I don't like to be suffocated, so I can't take a bath. Whenever I want to urinate, I endure it and don't get up, only getting up when my bladder is slightly turning..." The last few words really reveal the true nature of a lazy person. Summer is okay, but in winter, sleeping in bed, urinating is really a troublesome thing for lazy people. Lazy people mostly have this experience, and they will not get up to urinate unless it is absolutely necessary. If lazy people are not lazy, and they want to find an ancient person to be a model, then Ji Shuye is an interesting figure in history.</p>
<p>The year before last, the British philosopher Russell also had an article called In Praise of Idleness, published in the September issue of the Review of Reviews (British). He advised the leaders of youth associations around the world to rise up and persuade the youth of the world to be lazy. He believes that modern industry has developed so much that people should no longer spend all their time on earning a living as they did before, and especially should not spend countless amounts of money on wars. They should have some extra time to enjoy the pleasures of life. He also advocates that leisure should be for everyone, and that most people should not work excessively, while a few people exclusively enjoy leisurely work. This kind of modern philosopher's preaching is naturally much better than Ji Shuye's purely passive laziness. If lazy people need to have philosophy, then we can naturally copy Russell's words in their entirety. However, Russell also said that the countries of the Far East (China is naturally included) are still in the pre-industrial era, and the amount of surplus obtained from human labor is not much, so people in these countries should not be lazy, but should work hard to achieve industrialization, and then they can be lazy. We can see that Russell's praise of laziness has its objective conditions. In countries like ours, and people like us, I also say loudly that we should not be lazy. Although I am lazy, I can accept his words, but when objective circumstances do not allow industrialization, and the people of the country do not pay attention to the issue of industrialization, what can we do even if we are not lazy? So before this era comes, I still have to be lazy, because in my opinion, laziness is also a virtue. I think Russell's opinion is right, laziness should be praised.</p>

<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>At this moment, only Ba Gulik has a disappointed look, and no one would have expected him to abandon that beautiful hope.</p>
<p>"Why did Bayan Wang take away one-third of the livestock before letting us set off to Dariganga?" This question has been sprouting in Ba Gulik's mind since yesterday, and at this moment it is expanding. He wants to find the answer to this question from all aspects.</p>
<p>So Ba Gulik wiped the sweat from his face with his shiny sleeves, looked attentively at his daughter Anila, and then turned his face to look at those people in purplish-red riding camels, at the sweating livestock, at this group ignited by the fire of hope... Finally, he saw Bayan Wang's envoy, Nuoyin, wearing the purplish-red clothes that Bayan had given him, shining with greasy light, carrying a gun on his back, urging the long line from behind with great power.</p>
<p>"Evoking emotions from the scene," Ba Gulik thought. When he was a child, he followed his grandmother, father, mother, and many other people from Bihartu to Nukutai Plain by order of Bayin Wang. The situation was exactly the same as now. Before leaving, Bayin Wang sent envoys to take away one-third of the herders' livestock. When they arrived at Nukutai, people quickly slaughtered all the livestock, and each person had only one horse or one camel left, or a cow or a sheep. The weather in Nukutai was so cold, and the livestock did not eat that kind of grass. Many of them starved to death. People ate all the livestock and then starved to death. Ba Gulik's family all died, and he alone rode a camel and escaped to the southern part of Nukutai Plain... This time, I am afraid that the tragedy will be repeated again! He found the accurate answer, and immediately changed from disappointment to anger. Before his eyes were dripping bloodstains, skinny zombies... He couldn't help but shouted:</p>
<p>—We have been fooled!</p>
<p>Like a bomb exploded in the crowd, sharp eyes hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands... shot all over Ba Gulik's body.</p>
<p>—We have been deceived! Bayan Wang tricked us out of our livestock, telling us to go to Dariganga to die!</p>
<p>—Is Ba Gulik crazy?</p>
<p>The tents had just been set up, and it suddenly became cold, followed by a strong wind, sand flying all over the sky, hitting the Mongolian yurts, making a rustling sound: the sun had long set, and darkness covered the desert, covered the sky, covered the Mongolian yurts! Covered...</p>
<p>The wind blew harder and harder, and the sand kept flying onto the Mongolian yurts. Someone was shouting outside:</p>
<p>—Zhakasai's tent was crushed by the sand! Zhakasai is trapped inside!</p>
<p>A commotion, children crying, women cursing the wind! Young people were digging up the collapsed Mongolian yurts.</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>I don't know when, the commotion calmed down. Ba Gulik's anger has not stopped burning in his chest. He walked around in the Mongolian yurt for a while, sat for a while, and his thoughts seemed to be knotted in his heart.</p>
<p>His daughter Anila had already seen through her father's thoughts. This kind of thought slowly retreats down and easily turns into troubles! She knew her father's temper very well, and she couldn't bear the pain to entangle her father, so she said with a smile:</p>
<p>—Dad, it's been a tiring day, go to sleep early. Didn't envoy Nuoyin say that we can reach Dariganga tomorrow?</p>
<p>—Nuoyin's words must be unreliable. Dariganga is not paradise, it is hell for us herders! There will be nothing there! How can there be a treasure land in the world where it doesn't snow in winter! We have been deceived!</p>
<p>Anila's words not only failed to extinguish the fire of Ba Gulik's anger, but added fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>—Go to sleep quickly, Dad! Why be sullen!</p>
<p>Lying down with his daughter, closing his eyes, his heart was pounding, and when his daughter fell asleep, he quietly crawled out of the Mongolian yurt.</p>
<p>People were resting, the wind was roaring, the tyranny of darkness, the flying sand, everything was wearing away the night on the desert.</p>
<p>The next morning, two corpses were found lying in a pool of blood in envoy Nuoyin's tent. It was none other than Ba Gulik and envoy Nuoyin. The knife in Ba Gulik's hand was still held tightly. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e202">Talking About Superstition <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Fo Lang</p>
<p>It is not entirely true to think that only stupid people are superstitious. Often heroes are superstitious and understand the true principles of superstition.</p>
<p>Heroes refer to those who "know the times." Knowing the times must be a smart person. The superstition of smart people is definitely not a stupid thing.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, reading Han Yu's Memorial Against Welcoming the Buddha's Bones, I felt that he did not believe in gods and Buddhas at all, and I admired him in my heart! Because in Han Yu's time, even the emperor loved monks and respected puppets, and wanted to carry the "dead Buddha" to the gate of the country, which can be said to be superstitious to the extreme, but Han Yu dared to risk the taboo and say a lot of great principles to break superstition, and to hit the emperor's nails, it was a bit like the upright appearance of starting the decline of the eight dynasties. But when I read his Crocodile Sacrifice, it was not the same thing at all. Such a gentleman who broke superstition went to Chaozhou to be an official, but instead of taking practical measures to eliminate the harm of crocodiles, he burned incense and prayed, and took the article to sacrifice to the crocodiles, telling them "rascally ugly creatures" to get out quickly, which was still superstitious. But the book clearly states that the crocodiles got out the next day, which really confused me at the time. But later, when I got older, I suddenly realized that Han Yu's later sacrifice to crocodiles was much smarter and more advanced than his earlier memorial against welcoming the Buddha's bones. Han Yu was demoted to Chaozhou because he lost his high official position for memorializing against welcoming the Buddha's bones. He therefore learned the trick of superstition. He knew that superstition was a very smart thing and could not blame the emperor, so he applied this magic weapon. The meaning of his Crocodile Sacrifice was probably that he knew that the local customs were a bit barbaric and was afraid of suffering losses, so he came up with this method to make a show of strength. This time, Han Yu was not doing something stupid. He inquired about the rise and fall of the tide, and deliberately fabricated an article, saying that he really scared the crocodiles away. In essence, the intention of the article was not this at all.</p>
<p>In this way, the meaning of superstition is to be explained to the point of "bewildering" people without "believing" themselves, in order to exert the highest meaning of superstition. In recent years, the superstition in your country has become more and more prosperous with the restoration of the old. From scientific spiritualism to chanting spells to resist the enemy, it is naturally a kind of clever trickery of smart people who know the times. It is said that the inventor of scientific spiritualism has earned a fortune of thirty to forty thousand yuan by relying on "Ouija board." His small trick has been successful. Here, I also thought of a ghost shadow posted in front of a photo studio on North Sichuan Road a few days ago. It is said that this ghost shadow—a blurred ghost head—was photographed from a camera in broad daylight. Therefore, many people are crowding in front of this photo studio every day, and a line of small characters next to the ghost shadow is: available for scientists to study, two dimes per sheet.</p>
<p>The owner of the photo studio is smart, the inventor of Ouija board is smart, the people who advocate Buddha's power to resist the enemy are smart, and even Han Yu's crocodile sacrifice is smart—however, there are many smart people in the world. Can the clever tricks of smart people ultimately confuse people into believing? The fox's bald tail, I think, will be revealed all at once.</p>

<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>Tears shimmered in the hollows of his eyes, as if he had truly walked hundreds of miles, carrying a weary belly, both hungry and thirsty. A bloated light surfaced on his face, like a smile that wasn't quite a smile, perhaps a contempt and pity offered to passersby. He greedily watched the faces of the travelers hurrying past him. A voice emerged from beneath his ash-covered beard:</p>
<p>"Fragrant amulet, eh? Won't turn white... South Sea Guanyin fragrant amulet..."</p>
<p>It really did sound like it was coming from beneath his beard; it didn't sound like speech at all.</p>
<p>He was unlike the usual wandering hustlers, violent and unreasonable. Not grabbing pedestrians with shameless hands; or pulling in a so-called "decoy," using manipulative words and setting up traps to confuse people, then reaching into their pockets to take their money. His method was closer to begging. He said he wasn't a medicine peddler, but had been entrusted to handle things for someone else, and because he was short of travel funds on the way, he had to sell cheaply. Everyone else, he said, wasn't buying medicine, but rescuing someone in distress. The fragrant amulet was to be considered a gift of repayment.</p>
<p>He stuck out his index finger, poking his crooked nose, his unfocused eyes landing on those indifferent faces, waiting for the fish to swim into the net themselves. In truth, at that moment, he no longer resembled a person, but rather a bereaved dog.</p>
<p>A shallow smile convulsed and spread from beneath his stubble. He coughed, changing his spiel and tone, raising his voice slightly.</p>
<p>"This treasure," he pinched something like an olive pit and held it to the tip of his nose, saying, "comes from Mount Putuo in the South Sea, the Putuo Temple, planted by the old Mother Guanyin herself..."</p>
<p>Perhaps someone here would ask –</p>
<p>"The South Sea? Is that the South Sea of the Great South Sea Guanyin?"</p>
<p>This interruption stopped him. He carefully looked to see if the person wanted to buy, then, as if cheered up, bobbed his hairy head and replied:</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>Sometimes, he even chuckled to himself for a while. The speaker hesitated, looking at other people's faces, not wanting to buy. Perhaps he would even turn around and walk away on his own. But he didn't get angry because of this. He also knew that the person who had left would not come back to patronize him, so he didn't give that person another glance, and instead explained to the honest folks around him: this treasure blossoms and bears fruit every twelve years, cures all diseases, big and small, if you don't encounter it in ten years, it won't be cured in ten years, three will take care of it well... He even more generously crushed one of the beads in his hand and brought it close to everyone's nose, saying with great certainty:</p>
<p>"Come on, it really does have a minty coolness when you rub it on yourself... Don't be fooled, neighbors... Come on, come on..."</p>
<p>Rubbing the top of his head under the brim of his hat with his other hand, he suddenly got angry and shouted:</p>
<p>"Only selling ten, ten! Those who don't think it's expensive, come!"</p>

<h3 id="e204">No Need to Blame Heaven and Earth <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Our Doctor of Literature, Mr. Hu Shi, once led young people to resist the old society during the May Fourth Movement, and also advocated for the women's liberation movement, his reputation spread far and wide for a time. Presumably, he has now achieved perfect merit and virtue, and after having "tried" everything, he is now presenting a very optimistic view. Some time ago, the doctor said that Chinese women's liberation has made a lot of progress in the past twenty years, breaking the old family and old ethics, marriage and love are already free, women have participated in various social undertakings, economic independence, political equality, small feet have become big feet, and have made Chinese women the most beautiful women in the world, this is the recognition of the current women's liberation by Dr. Hu Shi, who advocated the new culture.</p>
<p>Because of his optimism, the doctor expressed his unique views on the current student unemployment problem, which is lamenting "no way out". According to the interview with the reporter of the Sixth and Daily Society, the doctor said: "I teach at Peking University, and I have seen many university graduates. Except for a very small number with special circumstances, most of them can find a decent job after graduation... The small number who cannot find employment are because their studies are not applicable, and their paths are relatively narrow. For example, Gu Jiegang changed from studying philosophy to studying history, and Chen Gongbo also changed from studying philosophy to engaging in industry." He also said that in order to enjoy work and have no fear of unemployment, the first thing is to have the ability and knowledge to do things. Every graduate of Yanjing University can be hired in advance by others because they can give society a good impression. On the contrary, those who cannot find employment should seek the reasons why they cannot find employment, and do not need to blame heaven and earth, but only blame themselves. If you have the ability, why worry about not having food to eat.</p>
<p>Seek everything from yourself, be strict with yourself and lenient with others, this is our full-fledged national essence's philosophy of life. Mr. Shi Zhi, who is a pioneer of young people, earnestly admonishes the young students who are currently "worried about not having food to eat" to introspect themselves. He is really worthy of his true colors, and I admire him very much. However, many young students who have already "blamed themselves" and have not "blamed heaven and earth" cannot "have no fear of unemployment," which makes me have to doubt the doctor's teachings, and I cannot help but express myself.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the doctor said, there are many people who have changed from studying philosophy to studying history and engaging in industry. We also see many Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Science students who have studied abroad and university students who have gone to the political arena to become bureaucrats and politicians. However, this does not mean that they have "no ability and knowledge to do things," but rather it precisely illustrates that China's entire economy cannot develop under various internal and external shackles, and cannot accommodate so many people who have diplomas and want to eat. At present, many students in this economic panic have extremely condescendingly sold themselves, but it is still difficult to find a place to eat. In this way, asking them to "not blame heaven and earth" and "blame themselves" is either covering up the fact of general student unemployment, or advising people to be content to starve. Secondly, although some school graduates can be hired in advance by others, they are either lucky ones, or it is because of connections, so that they "have no worry about food;" or it is because of hometown friendships, family connections, etc., that they get a "good impression from society." Isn't it often heard that a certain organization has become a hometown association, an alumni association, or a certain ancestral hall?</p>
<p>The times have determined the inevitable fate of student unemployment. What is the use of advising many unlucky students who have no connections or opportunities to "not blame heaven and earth" and "blame themselves"?</p>

<p>— Da Ye</p>
<p>The long-haired poet wandering on the banks of the Huangpu River hummed to himself in solitude:</p>
<p>(In the past! I was under the poetic moon, I was on the picturesque river; the boatman rowed us, Quli snuggled on my shoulder. She said this is not a dream! Love has grown in my heart. Now? She is as ruthless as flowing water, whispering love to others; she is happy but I am hurt, I painfully pretend to be wounded.)</p>
<p>The cotton-like October wind! Fluttered by the river.</p>
<p>—Quli!</p>
<p>Scarlet lips seared on the young man's well-shaved chin.</p>
<p>What? You said, you always call me like this. You look like you want something. Say it! What do you want?</p>
<p>The young man's palms were sweating. His mouth opened, but his chin trembled.</p>
<p>—Yes, my Quli, I think...</p>
<p>Under her high and broad chest, Quli's jewel-like big eyes secretly watched the young man's face, a face reddened by the burning of love.</p>
<p>Quli saw what was on his mind, reached out and turned his cheeks towards her, aiming at her seductive eyes.</p>
<p>—What are you thinking about! Look, in front of our eyes, this moving river view, how should we enjoy it!</p>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>—You come.</p>
<p>Quli dragged the young man to the pier. She waved to the sampan rower. The sampan rowed over.</p>
<p>Jumping into the cabin, Quli ordered the boatman to row around on the river as he pleased.</p>
<p>As the boat tilted, Quli pretended to be scared and fell into the young man's arms.</p>
<p>—I'm scared, hold me tight!</p>
<p>Holding a mysterious woman, the young man thought foolishly, thinking that since he met her, he had spent a lot of money! Although she was very affectionate to him, why did she always smile and not agree to get engaged?</p>
<p>Thinking, thinking, his body suddenly felt cold, and his pores opened!</p>
<p>—What's wrong? You're shivering.</p>
<p>Quli squeezed him tightly, she saw that his face looked a little different tonight, so she reached out again to stroke his cheeks.</p>
<p>However, the young man continued to think about his doubts, he thought, did Quli really love him?</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>—Quli, I know you love me, but...</p>
<p>The clever Quli seemed to not have noticed what he was saying, she was no longer afraid of the water and splashed the water on the edge of the boat.</p>
<p>—Look, the moon is so much fun in the water! Look, I'll grab it.</p>
<p>Saying that, she childishly let go of her hand and went to grab the water. The young man hurriedly grabbed her hand back.</p>
<p>—The water is cold, won't your hands get frostbite?</p>
<p>—No, with your passion, I don't feel cold at all.</p>
<p>The young man's face was unconsciously gloomy. Quli saw this and thought and thought, and suddenly told him that she had a good story to tell him.</p>
<p>But, Quli, who was busy all day long, what did she have in her mind? She thought for a long time before randomly pointing to the buildings on the land, saying how tall the houses were! Saying how red the neon lights were! Saying how many people were fishing with nets...</p>
<p>The young man's thoughts were shattered by her. He blankly followed her finger, watching the fishermen, watching the neon lights, watching the tall buildings, watching each pier, watching the long-haired man wandering alone on the pier, and it was as if he saw this long-haired man jump into the river, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Quli's laughter drilled into his ears again, she said:</p>
<p>—In this cool autumn night, there are still people coming here to swim, aren't they afraid of the cold? They're really cheap.</p>
<p>She also said that those who come here to swim are all lowly. Next summer, she would go with him to Beidaihe for summer vacation, and swimming there would be noble.</p>
<p>Saying that, she laughed again. However, tonight, he felt that Quli's laughter had a somewhat lewd smell.</p>

<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Squeeze... squeeze... squeeze...</p>
<p>In front of the soup kitchen, a large crowd of people huddled together, dark and dense, the crowd tightly packed, heads bobbing incessantly; men, women, old, young, shouting, clamoring, crying, yelling, the surrounding air filled with dust and dirt. But the crowd continued to grow larger and larger.</p>
<p>Today, Uncle Chang came later, so he was squeezed to the outermost edge; he held a bowl, preparing to receive a bowl of porridge to take back, so that he, his old wife, and an eleven-year-old son, a family of three, could fill their long-starved bellies. But there were so many people, and maybe today, like the day before, he would have to go back with an empty bowl! Thinking this way, he felt heavy in his heart; so he used all his strength and desperately pushed forward. However, the front was still motionless, and many people surrounded him from behind. He was squeezed inside, suffocated and unable to breathe. He wanted to retreat and take a breath, but when he thought that the bowl he was holding under his arm was still empty, he finally had to endure the squeezing, and his two feet had already been lifted off the ground by about four or five inches. He floated and moved with the overturning of the crowd, and the two gates of the soup kitchen in front were still not open, but the door frames were squeezed particularly loudly; sometimes there was a burst of excitement in the front, and many people's heels were unable to stand firmly. Those strong men could still endure it, but the women and the elderly men and women really couldn't stand it. They could only shout for help inside!</p>
<p>Hundreds of people, each stretching their necks, staring with hundreds of pairs of eyes at the two doors of the soup kitchen, with hungry and anxious faces, constantly sighing in front of them!</p>
<p>"Damn it, aren't they opening the door today? Our arms are sore from standing." Uncle Chang really couldn't stand it anymore, he muttered angrily.</p>
<p>"Really, they were supposed to open the door by two o'clock in the afternoon. Today, there's no smoke coming out of the chimney, I'm afraid they won't open the door!" The young man standing next to Uncle Chang also said disappointedly. Uncle Chang also knew him, he was Jin Gen from the river pier on the opposite bank, and his family couldn't survive like his own. Originally, in these years, not to mention himself and Jin Gen, but everyone in the whole village was spinning in the hungry crowd. Years of war were mixed with great floods, and the rich had all fled to the cities. Now there were so many bandits in the countryside, and everywhere was robbing and clamoring for hunger. In such days, the villagers were really suffering. Which family in the whole village could eat a full meal of rice, anyway, no one could even get hold of chaff! And God insisted on taking the lives of the poor: so this year there was such an unprecedented drought, and the harvest was empty, but the land rent and grain tax were not afraid that you would be short of a penny. In the days to come, I really don't know how to get through it; today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow... The more he thought about it, the more painful he felt, and a hundred knots had been tied in his stomach. He simply didn't dare to think about it anymore.</p>
<p>"The factory has not received rice, the porridge is temporarily suspended, this announcement." Suddenly, someone came to hang a white sign on the door of the soup kitchen. Then there was a burst of noise, and hundreds of heads flickered again in the sunlight, disappointed faces, hungry eyes, crying, shouting, and sighing sounds, mixed together, almost shaking the world.</p>

<p>— Pi</p>
<p>The other day, a student of a certain elementary school was kidnapped. Fortunately, it was noticed immediately, and the hostage was recovered. The police arrested a kidnapper. According to his confession, it is now difficult to do big kidnappings, because to do big kidnappings, you must use pistols and rent cars, which makes it easy to find clues. In case of failure, it often leads to bloodshed and even a loss. Therefore, he has now changed his policy and specializes in doing small kidnappings. He does not need pistols, nor does he need cars. The capital is relatively light, and the kidnapping is easy. The price of each hostage is only 500 yuan, which is easy for the kidnapped to pay. This is really a kidnapper who believes in small profits and quick turnover. Now the business is not good, so he uses the principle of small profits and quick turnover to attract customers at low prices. Unexpectedly, the kidnappers also use this method to specialize in small hostages. This is really a unique aspect of kidnapping.</p>

<p>— Philosopher</p>
<p>(3) Heroism</p>
<p>A child has no sense of self-worth. He does not know the position of mankind in the universe or the position of the individual in society. He only opens his curious eyes to observe the things around him, but ignores the thing called "self," so he has no pain. But when a child grows up and can use reason to think, the question, "What kind of reality am I, what kind of existence am I?" will probably bother him all day long. So he begins to draw a yardstick from the experiences, knowledge, and understanding of things accumulated in his memory, and measures the position of mankind in the vast universe and the position of the individual in the complex social structure. Self-evaluation is slowly formed. However, the evaluation at this time often exceeds the actual value of the "self," and because of this exaggerated evaluation, young people often have strong self-confidence, vigorous spirit, and are full of fantasies hung in mid-air, and regard life as an open road full of roses. When he walks out of the school gate, leaves the wings of his parents, and enters society alone, in the process of the struggle between the subjective "self" and the objective "non-self," he will find the weakness of the "self" and the errors in the numerical evaluation of himself, right? The "self" originally has no free will, no power, and is completely determined by the things of the "non-self"! Eternal tragedy begins from here. The center of all thoughts, experiences, knowledge, reason, and spiritual reserves collapses in an instant. In such a time, can people still survive?</p>
<p>But if you can't survive, what can you do? So individual human nature diverges, and society also has a myriad of different aspects. Some become skeptics,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>some become nihilists, some become Fausts and Don Quixotes, some go to insane asylums, some go to sleep on train tracks, and all kinds of thoughts and philosophies of life arise from here.</p>
<p>The destiny of life is an eternal tragedy: this is an objective and ever-present proposition of truth. Whether you learn from Shakyamuni to cut off the six thieves, break the five emotions, and eliminate the senses so that you cannot experience the suffering of life, or learn from Baudelaire to smoke opium and indulge in lust to numb yourself, the tragic fate will always cruelly arrive. Avoiding pain is a seemingly clever, but actually foolish method, and isn't such a despicable and cowardly attitude precisely the attitude that we should despise?</p>
<p>Regarding life, we should not close our eyes, but bravely face it, admit that it is an inevitable tragedy, and resist it, using the spirit of struggle as the foundation of our lives. Isn't that kind of heroism what we should admire? Let us learn from the camel, learn from the lion, learn from the baby! Like the camel, endure hardships and work hard to understand life, like the lion, destroy the traditional life, destroy all compromises and avoidances, and then be a baby again to reaffirm and recreate! The civilization and happiness of mankind are not obtained by following the destiny of history like the materialists, but are the result of fighting heroism. Let us, this group of sufferers, demand our own fighting power and our own will.</p>

<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch, Death Ray Gun Successfully Tested. According to engineer Clerc-Masse of the Ministry of Labor, he and his brother and an Austrian engineer named Rielhaus have succeeded after two years of testing. The function of the gun is not to kill people, but to make people temporarily lose consciousness, like being drunk.</p>
<p>It seems too wasteful to spend the efforts of three people and two years to invent something that only makes people "drunk". On the eve of World War II, we should invent killing weapons with effects above "drunkenness"; but France is not doing this. A friend who studied in France said that French women are the most lovely. I said that the engineer is even more lovely.</p>
<p>We Chinese are not willing to waste time and money like this. You invent as much as you like. You must know that the antiques in the old country are no less than the new gadgets. Just like this year's drought, the Soviet Union spent time and money to invent artificial rain, but our 63rd generation Zhang Tianshi only needs to set up an altar to perform rituals, and wouldn't it rain heavily?</p>
<p>However, I heard that Zhang Tianshi has committed suicide five times for some reason. I hope that he will quickly pass on all his magical powers to the 64th generation before he dies, otherwise, even toys that only cause "drunkenness" will be impossible to resist.</p>

<p>— Wan Guoan</p>
<p>"Fellow, wake up, don't sleep!"</p>
<p>Hei Da Ge was dreaming of playing Pai Gow with his brothers and got a pair of "Plum Blossom Nine" and wanted to "eat it all," but he was awakened by someone. How disappointing! He turned over and sat up, cursing unclearly:</p>
<p>"Damn your uncle! I still..." He just cursed to this point, opened his eyes and took a look, and something was wrong! Three soldiers wearing tattered gray military uniforms who looked neither like soldiers nor like ordinary people were standing in front of him with guns in their hands.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"We are the Red Army!"</p>
<p>These two words, Red Army, seemed to hit Hei Da Ge hard with a strong neck crutch. It gave him a shiver!</p>
<p>"Let's go, fellow! There are benefits to going with us. Drinking, playing with women, you can have whatever you want?"</p>
<p>When Hei Liu Ge heard that there were women to play with, he became confused. Anyway, he was useless. If he hadn't fallen asleep, wouldn't you three skinny ghosts be my prisoners? It's okay to go with you, let me, a Shandong guy, taste what a fellow province woman tastes like. He was thinking to himself while slowly climbing up. Hei Da Ge stood up, his two skinny legs were still a little weak, and he patted the dust on his butt with his hands. He had just taken two steps forward when he felt even more uncomfortable! He understood in his heart that his crutch was gone!</p>
<p>"Give me the gun,"</p>
<p>He said while reaching out to take it, but suddenly he got a kick in the butt, and the skinny guy cursed fiercely:</p>
<p>"You don't want to live, fellow! Don't you know that your gun has been confiscated?"</p>
<p>"I'm using it as a crutch."</p>
<p>"I think you look like a crutch, you bastard!"</p>

<p>Miss Bingmei's Selected Tang Poems</p>
<p>Huaxing (1260) 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Song of Everlasting Regret (Continued)</p>
<p>The wind blows her fairy sleeves, fluttering and rising,</p>
<p>As if dancing the Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Coat Dance.</p>
<p>Her jade face is lonely, tears streaming down,</p>
<p>Like a pear blossom, with spring bringing rain.</p>
<p>Full of emotion and tears, she bids farewell to the Emperor,</p>
<p>One parting, voice and face are lost in the vastness.</p>
<p>In Zhaoyang Palace, love and affection are severed,</p>
<p>In Penglai Palace, days and months stretch long.</p>
<p>Turning her head to look down at the mortal world,</p>
<p>She cannot see Chang'an, only dust and mist.</p>
<p>Only by sending old objects to express her deep affection,</p>
<p>She sends a gilded box and a hairpin.</p>
<p>One strand of the hairpin remains, joined to one fan,</p>
<p>The hairpin is split, the gold is divided, the gilded box separated.</p>
<p>But let the heart be as firm as the gilded box,</p>
<p>And they will meet in heaven or on earth.</p>
<p>Before parting, she earnestly sends words again,</p>
<p>In the words, there is a vow known to both hearts.</p>
<p>On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Hall of Longevity,</p>
<p>At midnight, when no one is around, they whisper secretly.</p>
<p>In heaven, they wish to be birds that fly wing to wing,</p>
<p>On earth, they wish to be trees with intertwined branches.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth may have an end,</p>
<p>But this regret will never cease.</p>

<p>Zhongxi (1040) 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening: Sweeping Qin</p>
<p>Don't laugh at my crazy, foolish, and filthy appearance. The Bodhisattva of the Underworld intentionally descends to the mortal world. He borrows a body to sit in meditation at Lingyin Temple. He writes poems on the wall to sweep away the Qin. The current prime minister comes to burn incense. Three sticks of pure incense held in his hands. He lowers his head and silently communicates with the spirits. He only hopes for favorable weather and good harvests. He only seeks for the husband and wife to have longevity. He blesses the virtuous father and sons of the Yue family. May they ascend to the immortal realm and be reborn soon. He raises his head and suddenly sees the poem left behind. The treacherous hero trembles with fear. This poem was made with the lady. When the matter is exposed, a raging fire arises. Immediately, he angrily calls for the mad monk. He knows that his words are full of Zen secrets and transformations. He can summon wind and rain and is capable of everything. He holds a fire tube to communicate with foreign countries. He also holds a palm broom to sweep away treacherous officials. The storm arises because of the exclusive power. He dies with resentment at Lengquan Pavilion. Returning home, the husband and wife discuss together. They shave their heads and convert to Buddhism, renouncing fame and wealth. They listen to the slanderous words of long-tongued women. They endure all the tortures of the Fengdu hell. Now, his whole body is cast in iron at Yue Wang's tomb.</p>
