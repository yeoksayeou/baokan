<h3>日［宣言］迄未正式發出　國際局勢轉陷混沌　美與關係國相約不受其拘束英將適可而止法取旁觀態度</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國政府對於日本政府發表之宣言、至少在目前不願提出抗議、此層似已證實、美國目前亦似不欲向九國公約各簽字國、普遍恊商、蓋美國之意、單獨由外交手續上、與日本進行談判、固所不願、卽使關係各國將共同討論、美國亦不欲首先提議也、大約美國僅將與其他一國或數國，公同登記日本政府發表之宣言、同時聲明各該國本身、不受此種片面宣言之拘束、而</p>
<p>各該國在國際上所有之權利、依舊維持、華盛頓人士謂日本外務省對東京報界代表發表宣言、已九日於茲、然其正式文件、各國政府尙在等候、大約國務院或美國駐東京大使、此時或已收到此項文件矣、（二十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）政府官員與各國駐使今日在此繼續恊商、國務總理赫爾在白宮與羅斯福總統會議逾一小時、副國務總理斐列普斯與英大使林特賽會談後、英大使默認彼曾與副國務總理從長研究遠東全局、因使觀察者信政府現正籌議英美對日一致行動云、此兩日造訪國務院討論時局之外交大員、討有中國公使施肇基·意國大使樂沙·法國大使賴巴萊·及嗬蘭公使第韋斯等人、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日此間接近外交界者盛傳、英美兩國刻已成立非正式諒解、準備採用雙管齊不行動、對付日本、此種消息雖爲接近政府各界所置信、然官方對新聞記者之質詢仍不置可否、據可靠消息、英美兩國之恊調、係以英國</p>
<p>駐美大使林德賽本星期三與美國國務院之談話爲根據云、（二十七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今晚英大使林德賽與副總理費立浦會談遠東大局、歷半小時之久、聞英大使曾以英政府所致日本之牒文副本送交費氏、並說明英國之立塲、又據某要津消息、美國對於此事迄今尙未取任何切實行動、美國未以任何公文致日本或九國公約其他簽字國、亦未表示卽將有何行動云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日與國務總理赫爾討論日本對華政策、歷一小時强、赫爾報告一般國際情形、尤注重日本問題、出白宮時、對新聞記者不表示意見、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本人之伎倆與　國際形勢展望　日本推托小提正式公文　歐美各國因覺無所適從</h3>
<p>（南京）據熟悉外交情形之某要人談、各國對日外務省十七日所發非正式聲明極注意、先後令各該國駐日外交代表向日外省詢問眞意、日外省則以該項聲明係非正式向報界發表、無關重要、始終推托、不肯將原文發表、致各國對該聲明内容及眞意、仍難充分明瞭、現歐美各國一部份因不明眞意、尙在詳細考慮中、一小部份因在遠東無多大關係、則緘口靜觀、英美則極重視、除英已令駐日大使向日外省提出口頭照會質問外、美政府對此事前持默察態度、近自各國務卿赫爾返華府後、空氣頓形緊張、除與羅總統商討應付方策外、並邀九國公約簽字國駐美外交代表談話、交換意見、預料美當局最近將發表具體宣言、申明美國政策、或亦與英同樣、令其駐日外使向日外交當局提出質問、據測、九國公約簽字各國不久亦有共同表示態度之可能、（二十七日中央社電）</p>
<h3>英日交涉内容　英大使向廣田堅决表示　維持對華條約權利義務</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日倫敦泰晤士報載稱、據外部所得駐日大使德萊之報告、英大使於四月二十五日與日外相廣田會晤時、曾明白告以英國保持其與中國締結各種條約下之權利、並遵守關於中國多邊公約下之義務云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外部今日披露星期三駐日大使林德萊與廣田外相會談之内容、據稱、英大使曾向日外相堅决表示、英國堅持其對華條約所規定之全部權利、並不放棄與中國有關之多邊公約下之各種義務云、今日掌璽大臣艾登於答復政府曾否要求日本詳細解釋對華供給戰鬥機·借欵·或其他接濟之質問時稱、英國政府之任何政策從未危害遠東和平、英國政策之目的在避免此類危害、故日本外務省所指實無根據云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）晨郵報外交記者稱、英國駐日大使林德萊已向日政府說明、任何片面行動、足以變更擔保中國土地與行政完整之九國公約者、英國不能認爲合法、英國完全遵守該公約所規定之門户開放政策、英政府以爲根據此約、日本在華之權益亦有充分保護、故變更此約或違反此約之任何行爲、英國碍難認爲合法云、晨郵報又稱、據東京消息、日外相廣田並未發言反對此項原則之聲明、是以就英政府而言、現不復有進行此事之理由、官塲以爲林德萊大使之交涉、說明英國態度、已挽回可變爲更緊張之局勢、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外相西門下星期一對下議院陳述英國政府對遠東問題之態度時、將以英國駐東京大使林德萊訪問日外相廣田之結果、報告下院、惟一般人以爲英國旣與日本政府有所接洽、不見再有其他舉動、蓋英國對遠東問題之態度、及其由各種條約取得之權利、業已向日本說明、至於任何國家、以片面意思、將規定列强在華地位之各種條約恊定、擅自作廢一層、亦經美國聲明反對華盛頓方面、對於日本亦曾有同樣表示、目下似不見再作此種聲明、一般人以爲九國條約其他簽字國、如認爲相宜、亦可照英美先例、各自</p>
<p>聲明其權利、就英國方面而論、殊不欲對</p>
<p>日本採取公同應付之行動、蓋恐使事件過於擴大而無益處也、此次英國駐美大使林德賽訪問白宮時、所以限於交換消息者、卽可見英國顧慮之心理甚重也、</p>
<p>（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國暫守緘默　不明白本眞意　靜待英美行動</h3>
<p>（巴黎）自日本政府發表宣言、說明其</p>
<p>對遠東特别對中國之政策以後、以間官塲極爲緘默、日本外務省之宣言、事後雖經一再補充說明、然日本眞正目的所在、究屬難於捉摸、惟負責方面旣無任何表示、可見法國在英美行動以前、不擬有何舉動、因英美對於遠東問題、關係較爲直接也、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>克倫斯基談話　遠東大戰難免　蘇俄無能爲力</h3>
<p>（巴黎）今日克倫斯基與美聯社訪員談話、稱世界緊張政局之重心、已自歐洲移至中國、故太平洋大戰已不可避免云、克倫斯基係沙皇遜位後第一届俄政府之領袖、今流亡在法、克氏宣稱、蘇俄不能爲任何遠東戰爭中之重要份子、蘇俄因受日本之威脅、在一年内或將贊同於［滿洲國］邊境設置非武裝區域云、至於何種國家將參加太平洋大戰、克氏並不指出、（二十七日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日使語調轉變　外務省宣言新解　忽欲根據四國銀團協定　由獨覇而爲利益均霑歟</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）日本駐美大使齋籐發表宣言、謂日本外務省發言人發表之聲明、此起全世界之震動、渠希望世界人士稍安勿燥、力求正當之理解、渠以爲外務省之聲明、如係出於首相或外相之口、則至少被人誤解之機會或可減少、齋籐又說明外務省發言人所以作此聲明之理由、謂多數外國新聞記者紛紛詢問中國商借外欵、以謀依據國聯會專家計畫從事建設、日本何以反對、外務省乃以此項聲明答復之、齋籐繼稱、渠無任何正式公文送達國務院、對於日本見地、亦不擬再作其他說明、旋又稱、國聯會各專家在中國之活動、爲日本政府所不滿、齋籐更稱、［日本以爲外國借欵中國、均須經由担任中國建設之法美英日四國銀行團、中國雖反對日本加入此項團體、日本亦必如此主張、］日本對於九國條約並無違反之意、特外國貸與中國之欵、不當使其用於軍事耳云云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英美輿論一斑　日成衆矢之的世界不能聽其僭竊　美國尤有直接關係</h3>
<p>（南京）華盛頓二十六日電、明星晚報社論稱、日本之驚人聲明、雖國際間對之尙未採取若何聯合步驟、但確將逐漸使日本變爲衆矢之的、日本之挑釁世界、决不能置若無睹、亦决不能聽其憯竊、而放棄國際間以條約所規定之在華權益、美國對於此事有根本合法及直接之利害關係、以日本之政策、文字上精神上、與門</p>
<p>户開放主義·九國公約·及非戰公約、均屬不合也、特權受侵害受限制之國家、對此政策、自均不能容忍、無論其過去之成功爲何、日木必須覺悟其帝國主義之野心、自有一種限制、逾此限制、卽必爲西方各國所决不能允許、日本旣已宣佈亞洲爲日本之亞洲、則固已達到此項限制矣、（二十七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）新聞紀事報評論遠東問題、以爲日本態度使以最温和方式解釋之、然果付諸實行、則必釀成完全之混亂、該報謂、［卽使日本所反對者、僅以向中國販賣軍械爲限、亦不能認爲有理、蓋販賣軍械雖爲不善之舉動、然較之阻止弱國不令自衛者、究勝一籌也、質言之、日本所聲明者乃表面之詞、其中包藏之實際問題固甚嚴重、日本以中國政局不定爲干涉之口實、然中國政府在水災瀕仍及日本侵略滿蒙所釀生之種種困權中、猶能毅然統治中國大部分之地土、其艱難締造、要亦有足多者、除人道上理由不計外、吾人猶希望中國日臻和平、日趨繁盛、而成吾人良好之主顧、第吾人所希望之中國繁榮、正日本之所畏也、［云云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國際援助與民族自救英</h3>
<p>今日我中華民族所過之外患。尙猶未達於極嚴重之時期耶若謂已達於極嚴重之時期。則又將如何應付之耶。此誠我四萬萬同胞於日本一再台硬宣言之後。所當予强烈注意之問題也。就歷史言日本自明治維新以後崛起於島嶼之間。掠臺灣。奪朝鮮。敗帝俄。所以欺凌我國者列强固莫不側目而視。而日本之野心。則仍未稍戢。厥後乘歐洲大戰。益肆兇鋒二十一條要求猶未滿足其鯨呑之志願。則我民族受生存上之威脅爲何如矣。由現狀言日本於各國列强環伺之下。率先對華實行破壞均勢之手段强裂東四省不足又進而决意把持整個中國與各國間關係。統制中國之富源與貿易充日本此次宣言之意。値欲舉全中國置其保護之下。淪我中華民族於萬刦不復之境地。封豕長蛇。貪慾無厭。豈但一二列强在華權利。受其影響而已哉今我國於此民族危機日擴之時。一般人之依賴外援者。僉謂日人如此悍然不顧。適足以攖英美之鋒。招國聯之反感。列强必將有以制裁其後此種不謀自救而專恃外援之心理。因不足以語民族自覺之道也。然而國家當至危極險之時。一方固在督促國民覺悟。集中全力以謀一致對敵然另一方面在外交上之運用。終不能盡行放棄。苟有一綫機會可以利用者則仍當竭全力以圖。卽如此次對日間題。吾人姑就目前之形勢言之日本恃其强大之軍力方以樹立遠東霸權自命。國聯如欲於聲威堕地之餘完成拉喜曼來華之使命。則非聯合英法之力。以美國之援助。對日施以重大之武力壓迫不可。然而以彼好戰之日閥。必所不辭。則英美法至此。果肯一拚否此人所懷疑者也再就今日國際間之情勢論。欲國際之聯合對日壓迫。必有其共同之利害在今各國之對華投資。英佔百分之六十。美佔百分之十。法則更少。此爲不能共同行動之點一。各國對日聯合制裁。必各無後顧之患。方足以鼓其爲市塲而决戰之勇氣。乃今英美法諸國。財政則貧困日增。社便則騷亂日甚歐洲時局亦動搖不定。有此後顧。更難共同行動。日人明乎此。爲敢下此極辣之手腕乃敢竭力加我民族以鐵枷。益使就範。以維持其所謂東亞和平政策此誠洞悉列强大勢之言。吾人固無可非議者也。然謂外交上有此失望。外交手腕卽可不用耶。歐美各國。確因利害不共同。内部有顧慮。而不易發生聯合制裁之行動。然而各國對於遠東之利害。實甚鉅大。目前雖有彼此之不同實亦可謂爲有全世界之關係。彼列强對我。誠非有何等之同情。而亦决不願坐視日本之强大。至於不可復制。試觀自日本發出宣言後各國輿論界惶恐之情形卽可知列强對此問題。亦未必全無考慮。有此慮。卽有容我外交上活動之可能譬</p>
<p>如人病。至極危殆。苟有一法可試。無不盡力試之。吾人對於外交之主張亦如是而已。</p>

<h3>宋子文報告　建設西北四項計劃　在西安各界歡迎大會演說</h3>
<p>小利—交通—農業—改良—衛生（西安）西安各界二十六日晨十時、在民樂園舉行歡迎經委會宋常委大會、到萬餘人、極盡熱烈、楊虎城主席、並致歡迎詞、宋常委及鐵次錢宗澤·程中行·焦易堂均有演說、末由邵力子致答詞、下午一時散會、宋演說原文如下、今天承蒙各界盛大的歡迎、子文現在首先想表示的、就是誠懇的感謝和說不出的快慰、子文此次代表全國經濟委員會、到西北實地考察、昨天一至潼關、自潼關一路到西安、沿途所眼見以及昨天本人到西安時所感到的、覺得西北門户的陜西、絶不是外間人想像的陜西、陜西的民衆已充滿了朝氣和復興的景象、此種現象、實在使得個人非常愉快、子文昨天方到西安、還沒有正式與各界交換意見、但是從各處的標語上、已能曉得陜西民衆對中央的希望、是能替他們建設、替他們解除痛苦要這種求、就是建設西北心理上的基礎、自民初以來、西北備受水旱兵疫地震及政治黑暗之災禍、西北眞是痛苦極了、我們因此連想幾年前到西北游歷的西洋人一句話、［西北地方是天之所忘］、這個意思、是天已經把這塊地方忘記了、所以西北經過這許多厄運、人民痛苦的呼聲、竟沒有人理會、但是最近是不大同了、中央的人紛紛到西北、社會的領袖也紛紛到西北、［到西北去］已成一種［國是］了、照我們的觀察、關於陜西復興事業、現在的陜西當局已經做了不少的基本工作、楊主任數年以來、維持治安、社會的安定已大有進步、治安爲建設的前提、有良好的治安、方能有計劃的建設、最近國内各大銀行、如上海中國交通金城、都紛紛到此投資、此乃全國金融界對於西北已有相當認識、亦就是楊主任努力治安的效果、邵主席尤是本黨有歷史的老同志、到西北後、修明政治、勵精圖治、在陜甘兩省對於地方有形無形的貢獻、陜西人民當然比我們知道的更淸楚、陜西有這樣兩位賢明的長官、因此經濟委員會在西北可以着手替民衆做點有益的事業、經濟委員會的使命、是爲全國作經濟之建設、他的對象是整個的、全國各省都要一視同仁、但是知道西北民衆陷於特别病苦之中、所以特别注意西北經濟委員會、因爲建設範圍太大、而財力人才有限、只能於地方需要最切而爲目前力量能辦得到的、先辦幾件、這幾件事是今年經委員全體大會所通過、付託西北辦事處劉主任來執行的、（一）水利、陜西爲我國文化發源之地、現在各事落後、政治上的不安、當然是最大的原因、關係經濟命脈的水利、不加興修、亦是根本的病源、關中自秦漢以來、歷代對於水都有好制度、所以關中沃野千里、成爲富足之區、淸末以迄民國、各方多難、無暇顧及、由是年歲豐歉、一任天命、雨多則泛濫成災、雨少則乾荒成災、極似菲洲之埃及、埃及開國極早、當初對於水利辦理有方、所以文化盛極一時、後來水政廢弛、沃野幾成石田、遂至衰亡、最近英國爲之興修水利、已逐漸恢復、富盛之基、我們根本先把陜西的水利能有辦法、關中恢復從前的繁榮、並非難事、至目前最需要而先着手的、第一便是恊助涇惠渠同洛惠渠的完成、涇惠渠在幾年前、經楊主任的督促贊助、已有甚好的成績、洛惠渠亦經開始、經濟委員會擬與以技術上經濟上的帮助、這兩個渠受經濟委員會的助力、成功當然可以格外迅速及圓滿、將來西北人民得益必多、西北最苦的水旱天災、必因兩渠告成而减少、此外尙有較大計劃、就是導渭計劃、須欵八千萬元之鉅、如能辦到、則全省永無水旱之憂、經濟委員會現正從事於技術上之研究、經濟上之籌劃、希望國家不久能有此力量可以辦到、（二）交通、現在隴海路不久可通西安、陜省對外交通已解决一部份、但要謀西北的繁榮、和全國經濟上國防上的聯絡、最低限度應將鐵路西通蘭州、南通四川、在目前中央財力有限、只能先從建設公路起始、以資補救、現在西安到蘭州的土路、一遇天雨、便不能行、若雨勢稍大、橋梁傾壞、計一年之中、可以通行實無幾時、而旅程爲期甚長、異常不便、現在我們暫時不望像歐美交通上之精良、但至少要做到天天能通車、天天能運輸、這一層在交通方面、確能貢獻於西北民衆、經濟委員會對西北道路有計劃、而嫌欵項不足、楊主任極願以兵工築路、軍隊本消費者、今一變而爲生利、軍政與經委會三方面合作、就使經費不充、亦必能達一定的目標、此可爲西北前途慶幸的、（三）農業改良、經濟委員會對於西北農業畜牧、因此爲立國之本、素所注意、故如農村建設農村合作等、皆在繼續研究之中、至於棉花、因爲是西北特產、尤爲研究之中心、所以在去年經委會、卽設棉業統制委員會、特聘陳光甫先生爲該會主任、一方面改良工廠技術、一方面發展棉產、並至美國選購棉種、分發各省播種、陜西旣爲產棉區域、於此自能獲益、畜牧於陜西雖無重要關係、然於西北其他各省之經濟、關係綦重、現在所擬辦者、一方面爲改良獸種、一方面爲設立獸醫、據統計西北牛羊因疾疫而死者、每年所値不下幾千萬元、自前述兩種改良辦法澈底實行以後、卽能爲西北人民每年增加幾千萬元之生產、（四）衛生、西北於衛生上無設備、嘗見歐美各國、年費幾千萬或幾萬萬國幣、設備衛生、誠以人民生活體格、不能健全、雖有良好建設、也無用處、中國貧窮、當然不能追蹤歐美、但是窮亦有窮的辦法、中國各省衛生設備、</p>
<p>已極不彰全、但各省尙稍有規模、西北則併規模也沒有、經委會對此認爲極端重要、希望能恊助各省積極進行、各種衛生建設事業、尤其對於西北、希望能替他作一點衛生設備上的基礎、上述四項、是我們想先行着手的、子文昨天方到、尙未有機會與各界討論、以後還請各界隨時指敎、並希望糾正其錯誤、經濟委員會所負的使命、前面已經說過、因西北特别情形、所以特别注意、祇爲財力所限、不許我們多作空談、本人素性尤不喜空談、祇想一心一意從實際上做去、但是亦要各界同軍政方面、一致合作、方能得到迅速而優良的效果、方能再進一步、爲大規模的建設、並且還希望全國各界、一致來西北從事經營、我曾和各銀行界領袖詳談、深知道各銀行到西北來投資、並沒有希冀獲得大利的心思、確是具有爲社會服務的覺心、我更以爲外省投資到西北、應注意兩個要點、並且遵守不渝者、（一）爲本省對於外來資本的保護、（二）投資者不可稍</p>
<p>存壟斷之心、現在中央全國各界、以及本人大家集中力量、溶成一片、來建設西北、西北的建設是一定成功的、西北的光明就在眼前、西北現在已經是光明了、鄙人今日所要答謝各界的、就是祝頌西北復興的永遠光明、程中行演說詞、原文如下、適在宋委員及錢次長已經盡量發揮建設西北的意義、鄙人想在文化的意義上、說幾句話、文化是一個民族爭求生存各種力量的總和、觀察民族的盛衰、不能不從文化着眼、中國自九一八以來、物質上失去東北四省、精神上更受到極大的打擊、兩年來國難的敎訓、使得中國的民</p>
<p>族復興運動、格外比以前奮發、大家要知道、民族主義的核心是什麽、就是要使大家認識自己民族過去的偉大、因此振起自己奮往直前的勇氣、意大利統一以前、意大利的民衆、大家曉得追念羅馬、土耳其最近百年來的獨立運動也是喚起土人對於君士但丁昔年雄風的感懷、此外英國人沒有不知道沙士比亞、德國人沒有不知道哥德、所以要眞實現民族主義、要使大家充分認識過去、過去的地域及人物、從這點來看西北、尤其是陜西、眞是中國民族文化發源之地、周秦漢唐的極盛時代都在陜西、周公秦始皇唐太宗都生長在陜西、陜西眞時提倡民族主義最好的實徵、世界民族的進步或不進步、可以拿他們對時間的觀念來判斷、不進步的民族對過去是留戀、對現在是敷衍、對將來是僥倖、進步的民族對過去是光大、對現在是努力、對將來是創造、我們今天的民族運動、不但只在認識過去、還在光大過去、陜西的過去旣然這樣偉大、將來創造的根據、根基也自雄厚、建設西北、本與中華民族的復興連成一氣的、西北的民衆及全國的人民應該認識西北的過去、光大這個過去、然後可創造民族的將來、陜西充滿了光明、中華民族也是充滿了光明、（二十六日中央社電）</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀書指導</h3>
<p>讀了三月二十八日的「我們一定要精通外國文嗎？」一文以後，我覺得還有幾句話要提出，並且請你們詳細指敎我。</p>
<p>我非常同意於你們的意見；業餘時間有限的店員等，不必去學習艱難的外國語。因爲卽就簡易如英文說、假如每天學習一小時，學六個年頭兒，程度不見得好。至於法文德文俄文，那更不用說。</p>
<p>不必學習艱難的外國文，我的意思不是說不必跟變動着的世界接觸。可是問題就發生了；要跟世界接觸，一定要有工具。外國語是一種唯一工具，可是却又太難了，那麽，學習容易的，比「英法語」容易，的世界語、（Ｅｐｅｒａｎ）ｌｏ）不是最妥當的辦法麽？</p>
<p>世界語因爲是人造語，文法簡單，各國的大衆都在活躍地支持着牠、愛護着牠，使用着牠，假如你要讀世界語書報，儘有給你讀；假如要跟　國的同職業的識世界語的人通信，也是可以的，因爲世界語運動，在各國均已風行一時啊！</p>
<p>至於站在聯合世界上的被壓迫民族的立塲說；我們學習世界語，不就是一種工具嗎？</p>
<p>—廣州熊之佛來信—</p>
<p>自我們在本欄内發表過一篇一我們一定要精通外國文嗎」一文以後，便先後接到了許多如熊之佛君一類的來信。他們一方面贊成我們的意見，另一方面提出了學習世界語的問題。現在，我們想對這問題來一次簡略的答覆。</p>
<p>「我們是不是可以學習世界語呢？」當讀者們向我們這樣問的時候，我們無疑地是回答；「可以的！而且是必要的」</p>
<p>世界語運動在國際間已往造成了很濃厚的空氣，這是誰也不能否認的。它的意義，不但在語言運動的本身上，有打破國際間語言上的隔膜可能，其本身卽帶有大衆文化運動的意義。作爲這運動的領導者，爲佔有全世界六分之一的蘇聯。那末，我們中國的大衆，假使不牟離開大衆獨立起來，假使我們也需要走入世界的大衆隊伍裏去，我們怎能不加緊去推動這運動，又怎能不學習這唯一的國際語－Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎ。呢？</p>
<p>有些反對者，以爲言語是自然長成的，不是可以由人工法製造；因爲這種人造的語言文字在未普及以前，想要一般人，均有練習的機會，實屬難能。旣不使練習，又怎能望其成熟。這樣從語言本身去了解世界語運動，自然不會得出正確的結論。世界語運動是隨着整個新文化運動的成熟而成熟，我們如果不否認將來的世界，有實現大衆文化之一日，我們便不該否認將有一種爲全世界大衆共通的語言成長之一日。譬如，中國的國語運動，雖然現在仍遭遇着極大的阻碍，但到封建殘餘完全肅淸，社會有了新的發展以後，一種新的共通的國語，必然要隨着政治經濟及新的文化的發展而發展，它將得極多數人的擬護而確立。當然，這樣說，並不是確認現在的世界語將來一定會成爲國際語，但將來的國際語，却一定從這裏出發，這是可以斷言的。因爲現在的世界語，已是一種意識的運動了。所以我們學習世界語，爲了文法簡單，容易學習，到是其次，主要的，還是爲了新文化運動的開展，爲了促進將來眞正的國際語言的建立。</p>
<p>在中國，雖然世界語運動，已有了　相當的基礎，但實際上這運動仍操在非大衆的人的手裏。與我們大衆尙距有一定的距離。不說别的，一本世界語的書，便比英文日文的書貴得多。這是事實，我們要戰勝這些事實，我們不僅是要學習世界語，我們還應該把這運動從少數人的乎内奪回來，成爲大衆自己的運動，就是說，中國世界語運動要轉過一個方向。這一點，却是配合着整個文化運動向來的。</p>
<p>最後，我們還得說一句，目前的世界語運動，雖然是整個新文化運動之一面，那末，當我們作爲一個新文化運動者的時候，如果我們自己還有比世界語更重要的基礎智識沒有具備，我們先决的問題，不在學習世界語而仍在着手獲得基礎知識，因爲世界語畢竟還是一種工</p>
<p>具啊！</p>
<p>質之高明，以爲如何？（完）</p>

<p>體育新聞</p>
<h3>江大運動會第一日　色項成績殊少特色　中央及光華將平分田徑錦標　女子田徑錦標中央一手包辦</h3>
<p>第七届江大運動會昨日下午在眞茹曁南大學舉行、各項節目、預决賽參半、各項成績、雖破江大紀錄有五六項之多、但殊少特色耳、田賽中央希望極大、徑賽當以光華之呼聲最高、女子全由中央包辦、今日下午全屬决賽、徑賽成績、或有可觀、昨日裁判員諸多未到、甚望今日全體出塲云云、詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>行開幕禮</h3>
<p>下午二時舉行開幕禮、大放爆竹、行禮如儀後、由名譽會長沈鵬飛致開幕詞（錄後）畢由曁南田徑家長曾榮忠代表全體運動員宣誓、草草了事、開始競賽、已三時許矣、茲錄沈鵬飛之演說詞如下、</p>
<p>各位來賓、各位同學、今天是江大運動會開會的第一天、鄙人因爲地主的關係、被推作代表來講幾句話、江大運動會是江南幾個大學聯合組織來提倡體育的一個集會、鄙人對於運動雖非有所專長、但關於提倡體育這個責任、是不敢推諉的、</p>
<p>提倡體育、何以要開運動會呢、第一是沒有運動會、不足以引起大家對於體育的興趣、因爲凡人都有好勝的觀念、如果沒有一種競賽來比較各人成績的高下、大家雖然知道體育的重要、也許不會十分注意運動了、第二是沒有運動會就缺乏了互助觀摩的機會、因爲各項運動成績的優良、是要有相當技能的、如果要體育技能有進步、除了練習之外、非互相觀摩不爲功的、所以運動會的第二個意義、就是使人們得到較大的觀摩機會、</p>
<p>故此、我們希望這個會的結果、可使到各校同學與社會的人們、對於體育上發生更深的興趣、也可使各位選手因互相觀摩的結果、得到更大的進步、至於勝負之數、乃兵家常事、我希望失敗者不必因敗而自餒其氣、正在因爲失敗而要加緊練習、以期獲得下次的勝利、又勝利者不可恃勝自　而荒廢了練習、因爲我們的目的應該不在江大的勝利、而在全國遠東、以至世界運動會的勝利、故此、希望大家共同努力造成將來良好紀錄、以期獲得國家的光榮、</p>

<h3>信手拈來</h3>

<p>ＸＸ　ＸＸ</p>
<p>女子二百米决賽、共四人報名、完全錄取、中央其三、光華其一、光華之曹慧貞大蹋便宜貨、落後有五六十碼之遠、畢竟得一第四、如中央隊中再加入任何一人、卽可得第四、然則曹小姐喜出望外矣、</p>

<h3>陜西敎育應行改進要點　敎部督學之報告</h3>
<p>敎育部前次派督學周邦道視察陜西省敎育、視察結果、業已呈報敎部、茲將陜西敎育應行改進之要點、探誌於左、</p>
<p>一·該廳各科會處工作尙見緊張、惟陜省地方遼闊交通梗阻、省督學一人、不敷分派、亟應增設、以便普遍視道、</p>
<p>二·各縣敎育局多已裁併、殊爲缺憾、應卽設法恢復、以增敎育行政效率、如爲節省行政經費起見、敎局職員、不妨暫時减至最小限度、薪金亦可酌量减低、</p>
<p>三·省縣敎育經費總計不滿二百萬元、數量殊少、應設法籌措、逐年增加、以資發展、</p>
<p>四·省敎育經費之支配、與部定標凖、多欠符合、中等敎育經費、職業佔百分之十四、師範佔百分之十三、中學佔百分之七十以上、尤形偏畸、應設法切實改進、</p>
<p>五·陜西省政府現厲行財政統一政策、各縣敎育經費、一時似不易達到獨立地步、但該廳應實行左列數事、期於統一之中、仍保存獨立立精神、（一）根據省府核定敎費數目、就各該縣預算歲入中、擇其稅源豐裕、及與敎育有關之欵項、指定作爲敎育專欵、俾來源穩妥、不受意外影響、（二）飭令各縣組織縣敎育專欵管理委員會、負保管稽核之責、（三）各縣如有增籌敎費之合理的辦法、應補助進行、俾得實現、（四）依照所訂整理各縣敎育經費辦法、切實厲行淸查漏匿、以裕收入、</p>
<p>六·省立中等學校所在地、分布欠匀、如省立中等學校總共不過十九所、西安一隅、已佔其七、職業學样二所、均在陜中、師範學校、以陜北疆域之大、僅在榆林有一女子師範、陜中設師範學校三所、而徧集東路、西路則獨向隅、中學分布稍廣、但陜北仍祗榆林設有一校、陜南除安康南鄭外、他處亦未設置、應卽通盤籌劃、重行分配、以期平均發展、</p>
<p>七·公私立中學職業學校、未標明初級高級字樣、及職業學科性質、名稱殊嫌淆混、應依照中學規程第三條、及職業學校規程第九條之規定、分别改正、</p>
<p>八·省立中等學校校名、無依照規程、以所在地地名名之、如省立第一中學校改爲省立長安第一初級中學、省立中山中學校改爲省立長安第二初級中學、省立第二中學校改爲省立鳳翔初級中學、省立第一職業學校改爲省立長安初級農業職業學校、省立第三職業學校改爲省立三原初級染織職業學校、省立高級中學、祗有一校、可以陪都稱、名爲省立西京高級中學、師範學校因有區域關係、可以範圍較廣之舊府名稱稱之、如省立第一師範學校改爲省立西安師範學校、省立第二師範學校、改爲省立同州師範學校、省立第五師範學校改爲省立漢中師範學校、省立第七師範學校改爲省立興安師範學校、省立第三女子師範學校改爲省立榆林女子師範學校、</p>
<p>（九）·省立師範學校可依照地方實際情形、暫分西安鳳翔·同州·榆林·延安·漢中·興安等七個區域、分别辦理各種師範學校、如因財力關係、一時不　易按區設立、可於劃定師範區内之省立中學、先附設簡易師範科、以培養目前需要之小學師資、（完）</p>

<p>此次　次在平津靑島濟南等處所見、日貨全形活躍、天津日人勢力甚大、隨時有發生危險之可能、且漢奸頗爲活動、尤以靑島天津爲甚北平次之、如靑島市黨部黃書記長大被暗殺、恐亦爲漢奸所算、至北方敎育情形、以時間匆促、未暇詳細考察、在濟時曾晤何廳長、參觀省立圖書館、頗爲完善、靑島敎育經費甚裕、各市鄕區學校校舍甚好、市校校舍建設經費達三四十萬元、故建築頗爲整齊、平市敎育經費前以崇文門稅收撥充、現此項稅收已歸中央、由中央年撥五萬元、市敎局經費現尙不至拖欠、</p>
<h3>本市敎費</h3>
<p>最後記者詢潘氏以本市敎費情形、據談市政府新預算對敎費並不增加、最多維持原狀、最近奉部令於二十三年度内本市設完全高初級職業學校一所、及女子師範學校一所、此兩校開辦費不算、經常費月需約一萬五千元左右、二十三年度上下兩學期、小學增加八十學級、每級一百元計算、月需八千元、中小學敎員年功加俸、月增二三千元、又社會敎會經費敎部規定至少占百分之十、現僅占百分之五、如增加約需四五千元、卽此數項、月增約三萬元、現本市敎費每年一百三十五萬元、平均每月十一萬餘元、尙不敷二三行元、一旦增加、本市敎費更感困難云、</p>

<h3>新式自動音量調節器</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>自動調節音量的方法、雖各有不同，但是牠的原理、總不外乎：當收音機接到外來的電波時，前方高週率可變放大係數眞空管的栅極上，卽有新的丙電壓產生，其數値之多少，與外來電波之强弱成正比。因爲可變放大係數眞空管放大力的大小，是與丙電壓的多少成反比的，所以當收音機接收本地或强力電臺的播音時，便能避免因過戴而引起的失眞；接收遠地播音時，又能避免衰落（Ｆａｄｉｎｇ），减少天電或其他騷擾。（請參閱本刋第十三期）</p>
<p>以前自動調節音量的方法，大槪都是另有一只眞空管專司其事的，此種裝置，使用雖甚滿意，但是實際上很不經濟；新式收音機有利用雙重二極三極管（ＤｏｕｂｌｅＤｉｏｄｅＴｒｉｏｄｅ）兼司檢波，放大，及自動音量調節等工作者，雖能省掉一只眞空管，但是一管身兼多職，效率自然减低；顧此失彼，事實上是很難兩全的。</p>
<p>最近英國新設計一種自動音量調節器，構造異常簡單，使用又極便利。第</p>
<p>第一圖一圖，虚綫内所示者，爲該器之内部構造情形。Ｒ爲高週率金屬整流器，（Ｈ·Ｆ·ＭｅｔａｌＲｅｃｔｉｆｉｅｒ）（正極向下，負極向上。）Ｌ爲高週波扼制綫圈，Ｃ爲電容器，Ｒ爲固定電阻。當外來高週率電流傳至Ｖ２屏路後，被阻于扼制圈Ｌ，乃繞整流器Ｒ而行，結果ＡＢ間便有電壓降，（Ａ端爲負，Ｂ端爲正。）其負極經過ＲＩ，Ｒ２及綫圈Ｌ１後卽直達ＶＩ栅極上。降落在Ｒ内之電壓，其數値卽依外來電波之强弱爲轉移，換句話說：外來電波强大時，眞空管Ｖ１之栅極負電壓，便立卽增加，同時牠的放大力便隨之减小：反之，電波微弱時，栅極負電壓减少，放大力卽加大其作用，正與普通用眞空管自動調節音量者相同。</p>

<h3>馬可尼勳爵六秩誕辰的訊息</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>本年四月二十五日爲新近來華備受歡迎的無綫電發明家馬可尼勳臘（ＭａｒｃｈｅｓＧｕｌｉｅｎｏＭａｒｃｏｎｉ）六秩誕辰，國際航海無綫電委員會（ＩｎｔｅｒｎａｔｉｏｎａｌＭａｒｉｔｉｍｅＲａｄｉｏＣｏｍｍｉｔｔｅ）於是日在英國倫敦代表世界五十餘國舉行慶祝，賀詞用無綫電播送全世界，並議决每年的四月二十五日爲「馬可尼日」，以紀念其發明無綫電成功的偉大。</p>
<p>馬可尼年已花甲，然精神矍鑠，大有老當益壯之槪！對於無綫電仍努力研究，現正專意於超短波的試騐，於其誕辰日在電話中對英國倫敦晨報聲稱：「今試騐五十糎至六十糎超短波已告成功，能於相距百里以外的Ｇｅｎｏａ與Ｌｅｇｈｏｎ二地通報，成績甚佳；絶無靜電吵擾，盡夜收發，無甚差異；惟有時突受變動，此原因迄今未明云，」</p>
<p>馬可尼氏又聲稱微波（Ｍｉｃｒｏｗａｅ）將來必能發達，以施用於無綫電報，電話，及電影上；無綫電將來應用於實業上，造福於人類，定非澕顯云。</p>
<h3>以新式複作用眞　空管１２Ａ７作單管交流機</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>在目下眞空管傾向多極的趨勢下，其内之構造日異月新，幾乎無從辨别，如複作用眞空管亦係近代新發現的一種，優點是一管可任兩種以上的工作，在上期本刋半解君已有詳述過了，毌須再贅。現在所述的１２Ａ７亦係新式複作用眞</p>
<p>空管之一，其内部構造和使用較半解君所述的幾種稍異，該管管内置有兩個陰極，熱度皆由同一燈絲供給之，並在兩陰極之間隔一遮蔽子，以防止雙方電子的互射而碍各部之工作也（如附圖眞空管虚綫所示處）上半部爲五極管，係４７的進步式，下半部爲兩極管，如１２Ｚ３整流管，該眞空管係專供放大和整流，或檢波和整流之需，（如附圖之接法）其燈絲電壓與普通眞空管稍異電壓爲十二弗打，電流爲十分之三安培，用以（照圖）作一單管交流機，乙電壓用九十弗打左右，則可用揚聲器來接收本埠各大電臺之播音，一管兩用，其工作和效率非舊式眞空管所能比，而用以作收音機管數亦較普通眞空管爲儉省，至於附圖除眞空管外，其牠多係普通另件故從略；</p>
<h3>短波常識（續）配諧轉盤的使用</h3>
<p>— 魏心蘇</p>
<p>普通短波收音機，有用一只可變電容器與三四個以上之挿入綫圈擔任配諧者。其所包括之波域，大抵自十五米突至五百米突。今如就其中取出一只綫圈觀之，姑定此綫圈所包含之波長波域ＷａｖｅｌｅｎｇｔｈＲａｎｇｅ爲二十米突至三十米突者。驟觀之下，吾人或誤以爲短波收音機配諧轉盤所包含之波域反不若廣播收音機之廣闊，蓋自十五米突至三十米突，其中所佔之地位僅十五米突而已；若廣播收音機則自二百米突至五百五十米突，其中實具三百五十米突。然事實則不然；蓋吾人所須計算者乃週率波域（ＦｒｅｑｕｅｎｃｙＲａｎｇｅ）而非波長波域也。十五米突之週率爲二○，○○○基羅週波；三十米突爲一○，○○○基羅週波，在配諧轉盤上所佔有者爲一○，○○週波。較之廣播收音機，二百米突爲一，五○○週波，五百五十米突爲五百四十週波，在配諧轉盤上所佔僅九百六十週波，是故在短波收音機配諧轉盤上所佔之波域較之在廣播收音機者寛闊十倍以上。反而言之，卽每一週波在配諧轉盤上其所佔之地位，在短波收音機上者較在廣播收音機上小十倍以上，亦卽在廣播收音機上每一週波所佔之地位等於短波收音機之十倍以上週波所佔之地位也。吾人如明瞭此種情形，則知使用短波收音機之配諧轉盤應如何耐心與徐徐移動矣。使用短波收音機如燥急從事，未有不失敗者也。</p>
<p>時差</p>
<p>如欲接收外國之播音，須明瞭地球上各經度之時差關係。例如蘇俄莫斯科之ＲＶ４９每日在下午八時格林維基標凖時間起始播送，在上海則爲翌日上午四時矣。美國之Ｗ３ＸＡＬ午後八點半格林維基標凖時間在紐約播送，在上海則爲次日上午四點半。英國之ＧＳＥ每日在倫敦午後二時半開始播送，合之上海時間則爲同日下午十時半。吾人如欲接收外國某地某時所播之無綫電，腦中須常記其間有時差存在。地球各經席之時差每十五度爲一小時，每十五分爲一分鐘，每十五秒爲一秒鐘。譬如在上海上午八時，在東京爲九時，在芝加哥爲午後六時，在紐約爲七時，在倫敦則爲午夜十二時。</p>
<p>距離時差地球儀　　凡備有短波收音機者，最佳能備一具地球儀。吾人由地球儀上取得播送地點與接收地點所距之經度，然後以１５除之卽得兩地之時差。吾人如欲求播送地點與接收地點之距離，可以細綫直接按兩點量取，其凖備遠勝於在普通地圖上以縮尺所量得者，蓋地面之曲度在較遠距離之測量上亦非可忽視也。</p>
<p>干擾問題</p>
<p>短波無綫電之接收，其所受天電干擾雖然較輕，甚至在夏夜雷電交加之下亦可獲良好效果；但於人爲干擾，則適相反。凡一切電氣機械如電車，自動電話，電風扇，年虹燈，電動機，發電機以及水汀引擎，汽車，飛機等等在短波收音機上所產生之干擾將遠過於普通廣播波域。是以裝置短波收音機之天地綫，其地位之選擇極關重要。如萬一收音機放置之處鄰近有上述干擾根原，則須用隔離引入綫（ＳｈｉｅｌｄｅｄＬｅａｄ·ｎ）與减少騷擾天綫裝置爲妥，關於减少騷擾天綫裝置法，容另爲文詳述之。</p>
<h3>眞空管之過去及現在</h3>
<p>— 飛利浦社來稿</p>
<p>（一）眞空管之產生及其萌芽時代；無綫電收音用眞空管之沿革，迄今恰正五十年。其原理最初得自大發明家愛迪生氏，愛氏在其初期之炭燈絲燈泡中另挿入一電極，實騐得在燈絲與新挿入之電極間有電流流通，此種現象卽所謂愛迪生效果」者是。</p>
<p>最初施諸實用之眞空管係弗蘭敏氏之二極管（一九○五），其後於一九一一年由封立民氏（ＶｏｎＬｉｅｂｅｎ）再施改良，眞空管高二十五粳，構造仍依初時，而挿入屏狀之一栅極。至一九一七年，眞空管始發售於市塲上，此時之眞空管又有相當改良。一九一八年飛利浦第一種眞空管（Ｄ號式管）始應時產生，該管在四弗打之電壓可得○·五安培之燈絲電流，而其屏極電壓則在三十與四十弗打之間。當時旣無高壓電源，其所需屏流只有取給於乾電池或小蓄電池之一途。其「低眞空」之眞空管（Ｄ２），因其屏電壓只需二十至三十弗打，故爲當時所重視。嗣後「後栅管」又應時而生，其屏電極祇需二十弗打；結果之優，於此可見。（待續）</p>
<h3>内外消息</h3>
<p>美國無綫電公司近况該公司經理之史德華收音機，早已膾炙人口，另有吉而文收音機，亦爲名貴收音機之一，其七燈長短波機，更爲特色，聞此次收音機新到申甚多，皆係最新式者，將於五月初旬舉行大减價，届時當門庭如市，未備收音機者，卽宜捷足，以期先得，又該公司經理之最新式沙而文燈泡，爲收音機中之靈魂，現到大批現貨，凡收音不甚淸晣之收音機，甚宜購備也。</p>

<h3>湖邊春色</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>宜南之　，車沿太湖，行半小時，湖中遠山遠山近山，面目畢現，有時片帆浮墨，有時叢樹隔靑，而水波浩瀚，雲天寥廓，方弗展秋山無盡圖卷也。　頭渚點綴已無隙地，僅留　頭淸凈，尙能遊目騁懷耳，小箕山全隸人工，與西湖豪者别業，同其都麗，宜於燕居，蓋幾忘在三萬六千頃驚濤駭浪中矣。夙聞人繩東大池之美，茲於歸途中折遊之。其他固幽　移人，若携　貯食，提壼沽酒，與二三知己，席草野餐，林花墜袖而舞，山鳥佐飲而歌，片時作桃源漁父，寗非佳事。惜來去匆匆，且春雨如絲，不堪久立，爲憾憾耳。宜興有東仇西仇，西仇之畔有雪堂，釣台諸勝。疏柳搖綠，映水如美人臨鏡。遠山疊翠，亂雲接白，有天然畫圖，爲之作背景，若得如錫人之好事，加以潤飾，不難成西湖第二也。蘇東坡有「買田陽羨吾將老，從此只爲溪山好。」之句，似非過情之譽，蓋環宜皆山，而洞壑之美，速勝林屋，西湖之烟霞水樂，膛　後矣。庚桑善卷兩洞，以深藏山中，遊者不易至，自宜錫公路通車，乃稱便焉。然舟車跋涉，尙不能早發夕至，而入山遊洞，尤須脚力，故女子之嬌不勝勞者，雖至而弗暢也。庚桑之遊有畫師陳涓隱夫人吳霞如女士，與不期而遇之宜興女中四女生，俱隨衆盤旋，往返行田隴達二十里，可謂健者已。然庚桑之遊，繼以善卷，吳女士亦謝不能從矣。其實善卷有籃與代步，反較庚桑爲省力也。</p>
<p>庚桑之山曰孟峯，善卷之山曰螺巖，背以洞狀爲名。螺巖之西麓有碧鮮庵，爲祝英台讀書處，似出附會。最可笑者，離山三里許，有村曰祝陵，謂爲祝英台埋骨處，其人有無不可證，卽信傳說爲實，其踪跡亦不在荆溪也。</p>
<p>胡樸庵先生長民廳時，曾有太湖公園之闢畫，簿書山積，研討盈庭，然以茲事體大，無從着手，人去政廢，遂失影響。然自京杭路宜錫路通環湖馬路已成其半，若進而成蘇錫路，復謀洞庭東西兩山，與石公包山之聯渡，則太湖公園之雛形已具矣。</p>
<p>太湖號稱盜藪，聞者有戒心，遊者每裏足，然公路旣闢，民居晏如，反較以前爲安寗，可知交通與治安，有深切關係也。</p>
<p>江以南惟西湖乃爲雅俗共賞，婦孺皆宜之地。自錫人潤飾湖邊諸山後，遊者乃盛，以其平易而供備周至，故每値休沐，自京滬蘇常計家眷等而至者，絡繹於道。而以梅花之號召爲最力，然湖邊春色，不必梅花，卽紅桃綠柳，亦頗蒨美可喜。若在初夏，則宜南渡至洞庭，迄乎秋深，乃須離湖入山。沿湖諸邑，惟屬吳江者，最平淡無奇耳。</p>
<h3>游侣</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>游山玩水，爲人生唯一樂事，脫能伴之以勝侣，則爲樂益永。所謂勝侣者，初不以男女别，而以各擅一藝者爲上；或擅攝影，或工繪事，或精音樂，或能文章，所至商討文藝，潤色湖山，於淸游之外，兼資玫錯，得益良匪淺鮮。此以益友爲游侣，游之勝者也。益友之外，復不可無膩友，此則限於一男一女，不能容第三人參列其問。船脣車腹，水涘山巓，有影皆雙，無肩不並，游踪所及，得佳山水，相與指點笑語，卽有爭辯，意亦良愜，此其爲樂，蓋有匪言可喻者。戊辰三月，偷得一日暇，嘗與伊人薄游梁溪，道出梅園，詣萬頃堂，放舟湖中，一攬黿頭渚之勝，三萬六千頃之春色，似悉瀉入我人懷抱者。繼復乘驛赴吳閶，小駐留園西園，登虎邱弔眞娘，拜鴦鴛塚，所至輒流連忘返，伊人每見佳聯，必錄存之，歸後卽手製心形小册子，寫以簪花小字，付予珍藏，用誌鴻雪。時不我與，今忽忽六年矣，言念昔游，恍如隔世，此爲我生命史中最可紀念之一頁，亦生平勝游中第一樂事也。茲以論列游侣，故附及之</p>
<h3>春在西湖</h3>
<p>— 孑如</p>
<p>一到春天，這天然圖畫的西子湖是越顯得妖嬈嫵媚更加令人可愛了。</p>
<p>湖裏的水，已不像冬天那麽消瘦枯瘠得掩不住湖底的泥濘。伊是滿的碧粼粼地在澄靜着，豐膄膩滑的宛如女人的酥胸，蜻蜓似的遊艇輕輕地在伊上面溜着。人斜躺在艇子裏，遠眺着周遭環抱的靑翠欲滴的山色，眞是心曠神怡的有說不出來的輕鬆愉快。</p>
<p>一縷一縷抑揚的歌聲，從每隻遊艇中悠悠地透漏出來，在湖面上交織着，籠罩着，陶醉了每個遊客的心靈。</p>
<p>湖畔的垂楊，抽出一絲一絲嫩綠的枝條，婀娜地在迎風飄舞着。碧綠的鵝絨似的草地上，間雜些嬌紅的，嫩黃的，淡白的花朶，把個西子裝點得十分濃艶。</p>
<p>肉香，脂粉香，充溢了周圍的空氣。短窄的袖子裏，露出一隻一隻白藕似的手臂，弔在每個西裝革履的男人的膀子上，　腰曼裊得越顯出那富有引誘性的曲綫美，圓　緻緻的兩條腿子，赤裸裸地在紅綠的旗袍底下隱約着，漏洩了無限的春光。</p>
<p>的確，伊們是「春」的先覺者；湖畔的點綴品，來來往往的把湖畔織成一團錦繡。</p>
<h3>飯樓小景</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>松江游記之片段肚子餓啦，走進一爿飯店，魚養在瓦缸裏，肉掛在鐵鈎上，眞鋔引人。</p>
<p>「就樓下吧，一樣的吃！」我說。我瞧着那邊桌子前站着的一個姑娘。</p>
<p>「我們難得到松江，不上樓定心的吃喝一些嗎？」胡沉舟可閙整扭。偏偏王琢亦贊成着；「好，上樓，上樓——」沒法想，跨着慢的步子，在樓梯上。他們那裏知道我的心事？不能在人家面前訴說的心事呵樓上很淸閒，沒有别的主顧，四角，靜悄悄地，把那隻花狸貓催入睡鄕了。三個子走到窗前，推開窗，暖和而帶着醉意的春光，便沒遮欄地瀉了進來，柔風，綿團兒似地扔上臉，扔上心窩，快意的，快意的。可是，心兒裏兀的一沉，悸着，跳着，年輕的人兒啊，是儘不起春色的挑引。</p>
<p>孤獨的人呵，老這麽孤獨下去？</p>
<p>「喝些酒吧，這麽個春天！」胡沉舟拍拍我的肩，微笑着。</p>
<p>便喝酒了，王琢喚了盆生蝦，依然是活跳跳的在盆子裏。我不忍吃，可是，已經是截去了手足的軀體啦。箝一隻浸在酒裏，讓它麻醉，讓它不覺得給牙齒　的痛楚。</p>
<p>「一樣的死啊，亦許，你的麻醉它的手段，在别人看來是更其兇暴了！」胡沉舟說。</p>
<p>我想不出回答的話的時候，便喝了一大口酒，伏在窗沿，瞧着樓下的小游，祗剩下淺淺的一綫水，近邊幾艘有帆杆的船擱起在汚泥上，春的陽光爬在上面，沒有陽光的地方，就攤溪下一片幽點的黑影。</p>
<p>對岸，平舗的石子街，白牆，黑色門，明凈的小建築輪廓，那麽很雅緻的在寂寞的　圍裏躺着。左邊，一支獨不橋，和在舌畫裏的一般，一些小販，一些姑娘，一些老年紀的人在上面來往着。我愛這樣内地風格的街。「我想住在這兒，我愛這兒的淸靜。」當他們呌我吃鱸魚的時候，我這樣地對他們說。王琢點點腦袋，胡沉舟也點點腦袋，儘悶聲吃魚。</p>
<p>「魚的滋味就怎樣好？」我有些氣憤。</p>
<p>「瞧姑娘的勁兒就怎樣好」他們譏諷。</p>
<p>笑出來啦，三個子。笑聲，把那隻睡着的花狸貓也驚覺啦。</p>
<h3>漠中怒筆</h3>
<p>— 大漠詩人</p>
<p>號野乾風走石磷。醜狐䀹眼鬼掀唇。可能噀血淫天下。直欲燔軀爇帝宸。八部諸龍爾何在。六根三毒我猶人。嘘空更向茫茫刦。孤影當隨月一輪。</p>
<h3>遊七里瀧</h3>
<p>— 陳師誠</p>
<p>里瀧者，漢隱士嚴子陵釣遊地也。子陵名光，一名遵，會稽餘姚人。光武帝屢徵不出；親幸之，堅臥不起。繼除諫議大夫，不屈；乃耕於富春山。後人名春釣處爲嚴陵瀨。事載漢書逸民列傳。富春卽富腸；易春爲陽者，避晋簡文帝鄭太后諱也。</p>
<p>自杭州湖之江而上；九十里富陽，又九十里桐廬；桐廬南三十里曰　　，更進，爲胥口。胥口鸕鶿間約三十餘里，名七里瀧。羣峯夾江而峙，山勢蜿蜒水流湍急，具巫峽之體而略微者也。其以七里名者，乃按舟行時刻計算；所謂順風七里，逆風七十里是也。</p>
<p>三月二十九日晚六時，乘友聲旅行團專車赴杭，就南星橋通商旅館宿。翌晨，赴江干搭錢江公司新江興輪赴桐廬。輪分早晚二班，早七時半，晚八時半；啓椗時刻，相差僅一小時耳。江邊水淺，輪大不能近岸泊；雖輪埠突出江心半里許，而登舟仍不能不以渡。舟至八時五分始成行。兩岸峯　起伏，作波浪形。桃已含苞，嶺猶積雪。江心多沙洲，洲植樹木，疏落有致。時宿雨初晴，江水陡漲，洲爲水淹，綠楊垂柳，僅露其顚。達山雲樹迷離，亂流斜陽明滅，如遊澤國，歎觀止焉。</p>
<p>四時二十分至鸕鶿；入七里瀧矣。兩岸羣山夾峙，巍然以高，峭然以險，江身寛狹　定，曲折之玄。遙望舟前，疑無去路，返觀船尾，失所從來；俯掠帆影，仰挹山光，翠滴松針，妍呈桃瓣，羊腸似線，樵子歸來，隱約山村，炊烟如縷，幾疑身入畫中，舟行釜底。古詩所謂「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村」者，庶幾近之。途中時見小瀑；舟人云，　之勝，在多石灘，水淺而淸，危石纍纍播水底，歷歷可數。今水漲，且挾泥沙，此景不可見矣，爲之憮然者久之。</p>
<p>四時三刻至嚴子陵釣壇，石壇二，雄據山腰，左右對峙。上築小亭，可以登覧。舟行速，不克留纞。按後漢書載光釣處爲嚴陵瀨，顧野王輿地志謂「七里灘在東陽江下，與嚴陵瀨相接」，據此，則七里權者，殆卽顧氏所謂七里灘歟？則其所謂嚴陵瀨者，又安在耶》豈瀧合灘瀨二者而名歟？抑又何以與灘同以七里名也。顧氏又謂「桐廬縣南有嚴子陵漁釣處，山邊有石，上下可坐十人，臨水，名嚴陵釣壇」。今壇高聳山腰，去水約二百餘尺，其何以垂釣，與顧氏「臨水」說不合。豈滄桑變易，今昔不同，有如是耶！苟斯壞而堪垂釣焉，杭郡盡澤國矣。雖然，子陵，巢許之流亞也，其亮節高風，千載而下，猶令人景仰不止。世之暮夜乞憐　人白畫者，對之能毌愧死。則壇之以子陵名，固不必問其是否垂釣處也。</p>
<p>六時十分過胥口，瀧至此已盡，山勢開展，波浪亦平，不復如前之險且窄；而同遊者胡伯翔諸子之影材畫稿，已滿篋矣。</p>

<h3>硯的研究（三三）附錄</h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>三吳蘭修端溪硯史載柳公權論硯，重端歙臨洮，次及於澄泥銅雀瓦，而　磯以下皆不與，余蓄硯亦以端石爲多，澄歙較少，至於洮石，僅二三方，瓦硯則一二方而已，蓋古洮石世不多見，古瓦至唐宋已多僞者，今卽欲求唐宋時代之僞者，亦不可多得矣。</p>
<p>四昔人論硯，皆以石之體質爲主，體質苟佳，卽非古坑無害，卽無名人題跋亦無害，王字泰曰，於硯重古，於墨重香，俗子之見，吳蘭修曰，刻硯必硯與人並傳。文與字並絶，若强作解事，蹈襲庸腐，</p>
<p>混題姓氏，乖悖古法，殊汚此端友，施愚山曰，近日官吏餽贈於貴人者，多命匠工雕琢各種星海雲龍山水人手，雖極精巧，然愈添俗氣，亦石之災也，余之主張亦如此。五　淸初愛硯家，得一名材，不忍妄施雕琢，輒裏以錦袍，什襲而藏，故今日流傳之硯板，尙有佳者，余存有硯板數方尙可觀。</p>
<p>六余先人遺有宋明人古硯數方，余又獲得明淸兩代之佳硯數十方，石質與作品，似均不惡，近因余六十賤辰，又蒙同事惠贈洮綠硯三方，可謂與硯有緣，爰易余齋額曰硯緣，並以誌同人厚意於永永不忘</p>
<h3>無聊來信</h3>
<p>— 無聊君尙有來函兩通，一併發表如左</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>一云一客來，見余作硯譚，卒然曰，子之責提倡新文化之責也。子所享受之生活。新生活中之生活也。奈何言舊。余曰，怪哉子之言也。子不見今日之新文化。有不於舊文化中討生活歟。子不見今日之新生活。有不於舊生活中討生活歟。古，舊也。復古，則新也。復古，舊也。復而參以新。古而雜以今。是曰調和。則新也。復而不復。廢而不廢。無今無古。無新無舊。是曰中道。則更新也。新舊安有一安哉。且余之談硯。不過自適其性而已。覆瓿可也。拭穢可也。金裝錦製。供諸案間。亦無不可。笑駡可也。鄙夷可也。視同正經。尊爲藝術。亦無不可。批評贊毁。一任諸人。客曰，如子言。曷不投以實申報不新不舊亦新亦舊中道而立之春秋。余曰可，乃携以付周君瘦鵑。無聊客識二云無聊藏硯中之較精美者。本擬將各硯題記及拓片。印於文後。惟爲地位所限。過於縮小。又不淸楚。致作罷論。殊爲歉仄。現擬預商館方。將來無聊如有興味。將該文補充材料。重加修訂。附以墨談。另印單行本。並將拓片製版。一同發表。未知能如願否耳（完）</p>

<h3>美學與生活</h3>
<p>— 徐懋厚</p>
<p>紀特（ＡｎｄｒｅＧｉｄｅ）的隨感錄中，有如左的一則；</p>
<p>一波特萊爾（Ｂｏｕｄｅｌａｉｒｅ）有句云；</p>
<p>在那里，一切全是秩序，美，榮耀，靜寂和快樂。（見旅行之邀請）</p>
<p>在無心的讀者看來，這只是名詞的羅列。但是我，却從中發現了藝術作品的完全的定義，我先把每個名詞所含的内容，個别地加以考量，而後對於牠們全體所構成的花束似的美麗及其效果，不禁大爲驚歎。因爲其中沒有一個字是非必要的，而且每一個字都安排得很妥當。把這些名詞作爲美學槪論的各章的標題，實在很適當，卽</p>
<p>第一章：秩序（論理，理論的構成）</p>
<p>第二章：美（綫，躍動，側面）</p>
<p>第三章：榮耀（規整的豐艶）</p>
<p>第四章：靜寂（動搖的鎭靜）</p>
<p>第五章：快樂（肉感，素材之美，魅力）</p>
<p>誠然，合乎這五者的境界，可以說是完美的境界，作品也是最完美的藝術的作品了。然而這樣的境界，究竟非人間世所有，故波特萊爾也只能幻想此種境界描寫在詩中，他說在那里，　　的天空中現着朦朧的太陽，如孩子們的含淚的眼簾中，透露着嫶媚的秋波，他說在那里，一切房中的飾物，無一不具着特殊的風味；他說在那里，整個世界被籠在温暖的光輝中。他呌「我的孩子們，我的姊妹」，一齊到那里去，戀愛那個地方，死在那個地方。</p>
<p>然而，這樣的境界，究竟非人間世之所有，是故人間也產生不出這樣完美的藝術作品。沒有充實的生活的基礎，則一切美學的標凖，都是可望而不可卽的。可是有許多藝術家，却死，抱住美學的標凖，每逢寫作，往往首先想到藝術的完成，換言之，卽欲以幻想的美學的境界來充實生活或掩飾生活的空虚。</p>
<p>這樣的把藝術建築在幻想的美學上面，託爾斯泰早曾反對。他說，將來的藝術該篆於别的基礎上面。「藝術不是一種職業，這是眞正的感情的表現，因此，藝術家祗在當他不孤立的」</p>
<p>時候，當他在人間過着自然的生活之際，始能經騐眞正的感情。所以逃避人生的人，一定是處於創作上的最壞的狀態的。」</p>
<p>生活和美學，在藝術家當然是不可偏廢的。但是不當將生活遷就美學，而當從生活中看出美學。美學的生活是空虚的東西，生活的美學纔是眞正的藝術。旣然如此，美學就沒有一定的標凖，才其是舊日的美學的標凖絶不是以範圍今日的藝術。因爲生活的美學是極其複難而且時常發動的。</p>
<h3>方巾氣研究</h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>在我創辦論語之時，我就認定方巾氣道學氣是幽默之魔敵。倒不是因爲道學文章能抵制幽默文學，乃因道學環境及對幽默之不了解，必影響於幽默家之爲寫作，使執筆時，似有人在背後怒目偷覷。這樣是不宜於幽默寫作的。惟有保持得住一點天眞，有點傲優，不顧此種陰森冷猪肉氣者，才寫得出一點幽默。這種方巾氣的影響，在論語之投稿及批評者，都看得出來。在批評方面，近來新舊衛道派頗一致，方巾氣越來越重。凡非哼哼喞喞文學，或杭唷杭唷文學，皆在鄙視之列。今人有人雖寫白話，實則在潛意識上中道學之毒甚深</p>
<p>，動輒任何小事，必以救國「亡國」掛在頭上，於是用國貨牙刷也是救國，賣香水也是救國，弄得人家一舉一動打一個　也不得安閒。有人留學，學習化學工程，明明是學製香水，練牛皮，却非說是實業救國不可。其實都是自幼作文說慣了「今夫天下」「世道人心」這些名詞還在潛意識中作崇吧。所以這班人，名詞雖新，態度却舊，實非西方文化產兒，與政客官僚一樣。他們是不配批評要人今夫天下的通電的。西洋人討論女子服裝，亦只認爲審美上問題，到中國便成了倫理世道什麽夷夏問題。西人看見日蝕，也只當作歷象研究，一到中國，也變成有關天下治亂的災異了。西方也有人像李格，身爲大學敎授，却因天性所近，好寫一些幽默小品，挖苦照相家替人排頭扭頸，作者讀者也沒有想到「文學正宗」「國家興亡」上面去。然而幽默文學，却因此發達。假如中國人如老舍作一篇「吃蓮花的」便有人責問，你寫這些有何關於世道人心，有何益於中國文化？這不是桐城妖孽還在作祟是什麽？因此一着，寫作的人，也無意中受此輩方巾氣之壓迫，拿起筆來，必以諷世自命，於是純粹的幽默乃爲熱烈甚至酸腐的諷刺所籠罩下去。</p>
<p>辦幽默刋物是怎麽一回事？不過辦一幽默刋物而已，何必大驚小怪？原來在國外各種正經大刋物之内，仍容得下幾種幽默刋物。但一至中國，便不然了。一家幽默，家家幽默，必須「風行一時一，人人效　。由是譽幽默者以世道譽之，毁幽默者，亦以世道毁之。這正如一個乳嗅未乾專攻文學　年的洋博士回到中國被人捧爲文學專家一樣的有苦難言，哭笑不得。其實我林語堂並無野心，只因生性所近，素惡東方雜誌長篇闊論，又好雜沓亂談，此種文章旣無處發表，只好自辦一個，幸而有人出版，有人購讀，就一直胡閙下氣。充其量，也不過在國中已有各種嚴肅大雜誌之外，加一種不甚嚴肅之小刋物，調劑調劑空氣而已。原未嘗存心打倒嚴肅雜誌亦未嘗强普天下人皆寫幽默文。現在批評起來，又是什麽我在救中國或亡中國了。（未完）</p>
<p>民謠</p>
<h3>登軋車　河北民歌</h3>
<p>— 俊儒</p>
<p>小－姐，登軋車，－登登到响午過，腿兒酸肚又餓婆婆扔個糠窩窩，咬一口，好難過！跳井吧，井又深；跳河吧！河又寛：把着房檐呌老天，眼兒通紅淚漣漣。</p>
<h3>買書的癖（續）</h3>
<p>— 劉大杰</p>
<p>回國以後，買書的興趣，又轉到綫裝書上去。兩年前專喜買一些詞的專集，五代的，宋元的，明淸的，見了心愛的就買了回來，一年以後，成績果然也就不壞。到了去年，對於詞集的興味又淡了，歡喜買些明末諸家的文集。這些書比起西文和詩詞來，要貴得多，一部書，不過薄薄的三五本，動輒要五六十塊錢。並且書店裏還不多見，書愈少，價錢愈貴，心裏也就更想買。有時付房租的付米賬的錢，也都送到書店老　的手裏去了。弄到我們一個小小的家庭。家用總是不够。自己這一年來，一件衣服也沒有添補，皮鞋的底也穿了洞，我也懶得去管牠，連太太幾件極不値錢的手飾，也替她弄得精光了。</p>
<p>有一天，妻給我七塊錢，呌我到先施公司去買一罐奶粉，給小孩吃。我去的時候，打算買了奶粉就回來的，可是，下了電車，覺得時候還早，何不到書店裏去看看呢！結果，是那七塊錢又送了書店，抱着幾本破書，在著色蒼茫中，坐上回家的電車了，那晚上，太太是如何的責備我，孩子是如何地在床上餓着哭，我也不必多寫了。</p>
<p>什麽事都怕成癖，成了癖，就好像抽烟上了癮似的，要戒也就很難了。記得英國吉辛有篇題名爲蠧魚的小說，就是</p>
<p>描寫一個買書成癖者的悲哀的故事。去年偶爾同郁達夫先生談到這一篇作品，他說；「要我們這些買書病者，才懂得這篇小說的好處。」我每天次感到買書無錢的苦痛的時候，就想起那篇小說裏的主人翁和他那病道的太太來。</p>
<p>這幾年來，大大小小我總也算是有職</p>
<p>業的人，可是，手中的餘錢，是一文也沒有，見了書就想買，要買又沒有錢，這種苦痛，同發了癮的人沒有錢買鴉片烟，是相差不遠的罷。然而這種苦痛，也要過來人才懂得。</p>
<p>最近我寫給林語堂先生的信上說；「學校欠薪，手中又無餘錢，買書成癖，奈何奈何？」初眼看吉，這三四句輕描淡寫的話，好像是小品式的尺牘，其實，在我個人，是感着幾分眞切的苦味的</p>
<h3>來函照登</h3>
<p>— 郭明謝雲翼同啓</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>自由談今日載林語堂一文，涉及敝刋，因答一書，寄請在自由談刋出，以明是非，不勝感幸！</p>
<p>郭明謝雲翼同啓</p>
<p>致林語堂書語堂足下：</p>
<p>今天在自由談上，得讀大作「周作人詩讀法」·涉及拙編人言週刋；謂人言與其他刋物對尊編人間世亦曾作系統的攻擊。披誦之餘，誠有令人不能巳於言者。</p>
<p>人言與足下之關係亦惟足下知之最深；前次足下在論語所刋啓事，同人固不願多所嘵舌；今番關於人間世，各方雖不無評質，然人言却未置一辭，在足下或以憤懣之餘，指鹿爲馬，而在同人却憑空生出是非來，實爲始料所不及。</p>
<p>足不提倡小品文，是乃各人嗜好，同人等當然無話可說；但平心而論，「十四年來中國現代文學唯一之成功，小品文之成功也，···」一段文字，究竟不無有「鬁鬁頭兒子自己好」之嫌。足下倡導「幽默」允宜超脫不覊，但近來尊作徒見懣盛之氣，倡幽默者果應如是耶。</p>
<p>夫小品文不過文學上一種體裁，固無提倡或打倒之必要，爭辯解釋，在同人看來，本來太覺「天眞」！</p>
<p>足下爲文學努力，不勝欽佩，但見仁見智，各有不同。方今政潮所趨，崇尙ＸＸ，足下談國事時，亦常以·········而鄙棄之，特觀最近足下論調，竟有欲行文學的獨裁之趨勢，不禁便人愕然。叨在知己，謹此附陳，如有未盡之處，而須指敎者，若其範圍僅限於個人之意見不同，而與大局無關者，自以約期面談爲妙。否則筆墨之間，徒留痕跡，轉貽人以「登龍有術」之譏，想亦爲足下所不取也。書不盡意，卽頌</p>

<h3>故鄕行</h3>
<p>「阿就是住人個　　　旅館，」他一半爲他自己解釋，一半詢問地說；他告訴了我有旅　，還告訴了我那一家最好。到光福他本可從御道一直去了的，可是他也折入了木凟鎭。在經過一案茶店的時　，我　他進去喝茶。在那茶店裏只有兩三個别的茶客，似乎他都總識，在同他們隨便談着。我</p>
<p>問他要不要吃些點心，他說他剛在觀前吃得很飽。因爲還要</p>
<p>趕路，坐了不久，他就走了。</p>
<p>臨走，爲了幾支烟和一杯茶，他又重新謝了再謝。其實我倒希望他把他光福的住址告訴我</p>
<p>，也許我會去看他。</p>
<p>問淸了石家飯店的所在，我也離開了那茶店。走了沒有幾步，就看到了一家石家飯店，可是名副其實地是賣飯的，並沒有可寄宿的地方。待過了一座橋，在下塘的沿河，從一塊白水灰的墻壁上才看到了那「石家飯店旅社」六個字。我　走了進去。一個茶房領着路。到了第　道客廳上，茶房在開一個房間的門。正在那時，我看到了一個第十七號的房間。我問他它開出了沒有。他說沒有。我便開了它，因爲我喜歡那個數目。</p>
<p>想到什麽地方去走走，所以略坐了坐，就出了石家飯店的門。在想了幾個去處以後，終於决定了到那在幼時甚爲嚮往的河灘去。</p>
<p>那確切的年齡現在記不起了，可是總在六歲以前，因爲六歲以後，我就離開了這出生之鄕上蘇州城去讀書去了。那我</p>
<p>所住着的屋子是臨着一條直貫木凟鎭的河流，那是一個運河與太湖之間的總滙。隔河有一個灘，在白天總是許多鴨在那里幽閑地修飾着羽毛，或者下到水裏去自在地游　。我眞　那情景。我常站在窗邊望着它們，凝注地，艶羨地。我眞想到它們的中間去，可是又似乎覺得那是那樣地遙遠，那樣地不可及，雖然那是一個在我</p>
<p>那一節生活中的最留戀的地方，我終於從沒有去過，雖然我嘗回到過不曉得多少次的木凟。</p>
<p>現在我是在回味地向那里走着。那離石家飯店並不遠，所以不幾分鐘就走到了。河灘似</p>
<p>乎依舊是那樣的河灘，鴨也似乎依舊是那幾隻鴨。我站在那架在一條支流上的小橋上望着它們，望着它們在幽閑地修飾着羽毛，在水面上自在地游盪。我並隔河望着那在其中嘗消磨了我一些生命的開始的歲月的屋子，可是那對我似乎並不熟悉。</p>
<h3>篇中世紀的小說（二）</h3>
<p>— 美國ＭａｒｋＴｗａｉｎ著尊寒譯</p>
<p>「你好好的聽我說啦。你要把我每句話都記牢。我們有着一條和日耳曼一樣古老的法律，」</p>
<p>凡一個女人不曾當着民衆合法地舉行過加冕禮時，卽使在公爵的寳座上坐下一刻兒，也要被處死刑。因此，你得記住我的話。你得裝作謙遜。你祗能在那安在公爵寳座底下的首相席位上宣讀你的裁决。你得這樣一直繼續到你舉行過加冕禮而被救時爲止。也許你的性别會永遠不被人發覺的，可是我們在這險惡的塵世生活中最好事事預防着。」</p>
<p>「啊，父親，難道因爲這原因，我的一生便得成爲一種虚誑嗎？爲什麽我得剝奪我那無罪的堂妹的權利呢？請你饒了我罷，父親，請饒了你了　孩子罷！」</p>
<p>「」怎的，壤東西！這就是我給你預備好那無上的幸運的報償啦！我向你發誓，你這種婆婆媽媽的嘴臉，是和我的性格不合的。給我立刻動身去見爵罷，並且當心不要反抗我的計劃。」</p>
<p>這便是他們父女倆的談話。我們可以想到那可愛的孩子的祈禱，請求，和眼淚都是沒有用處的。不論什麽都不能打動那固執的克魯根斯坦老爵爺的心。因此，這靑年女郎祇好滿懷悲痛地看着爵府的大門在她身後關上了，自己被一羣家奴騎十簇擁着，在黑夜裏跨馬前進。　　老男爵當他的女兒走了以後，沉默了一會，隨後轉身對他那悲戚的女人說道：</p>
<p>「夫人，我們的事情好像進行得很順利呢。我把那機靈而又漂亮的德淸伯爵送去引誘我哥哥的女兒康絲已經足足三個月了。如果他失敗，我們便不能够全　；但如果他成功，世問便再沒有什麽權力可以阻止我們的女兒成爲女公了，卽使惡運要使她永遠不能成爲公爵的話。」</p>
<p>「我心裏充滿着恐怖。然而一切還有成功的可能。」男爵夫人回答。</p>
<p>「嗤！夫人！你不要瞎操心罷。讓我們去睡且去夢想着勃郎登堡和它的威　罷！」</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在上節所述的事故發生六天之後，勃郎登堡公國燦爛的首都到處輝耀着華麗的軍用儀仗，響澈着忠誠的人民的歡呼。公爵的靑年繼承者　娜已經到來了。老公爵的心裏洋溢着喜悅之情，因爲　娜堂堂一表的容貎和優雅的舉止立刻把他引動了。爵府那些大廳裏全是貴人，他們都很有禮貎的接待　娜。前途是已從那些動人且幸福的顏色中預示出來，因此老公爵的恐懼和憂慮全消滅了，換上了一片愉快和滿足。</p>

<h3>金融市險象環生</h3>
<p>按四十兩月原爲銀錢業之最活動時期、而四月底因絲茶用欵特多、故較十底爲更甚、詎今年金融界以百業凋零、放欵特特别審愼、而另一方面因内地匪氛不靖、現金積集上海、致演成今日畸形之局面、目下北方環境不佳、則首先受其影響者、亦厥爲金融界、故今年長期方面殊無成績足言不過聯敷衍、以彰門面耳、昨日長期交易、新做出二百餘萬、交割三百四十餘萬、洋拆價較昨日加昻一分、計早午市同爲六分、劃頭加水二分、拆票交易、早市轉賬及新交易五百零數萬、午市交易二十餘萬、小總會中交易三十餘萬、銀行收解外商銀行收解票欵二百七十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊結雜等欵收解七百二十餘萬、電匯欵五十餘萬、出倉五十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百三十餘萬、各種貨滙押墊結雜等欵收解六百八十餘萬、關稅欵七十餘萬、電匯欵四十餘萬、出倉四十萬、日商銀行收解要欵三百五十餘萬、各種貨匯墊押結雜等欵收解五十五萬、進倉三十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千三百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解六百七十餘萬、各路滙欵六十餘萬、收現五六十萬、洋押欵交易取　及新做出一百七十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出二百三十餘萬、客路來源二十萬、去胃四十五萬、</p>

<h3>江角飛漲九元</h3>
<p>昨江南小洋、因繭市需廣闊、廠方派人搜求、致市面驟然緊張、早市開盤卽較前日高出四元半、計爲八百四十五元五角、午市因收數不足、復加高四元半、計爲八百五十元、結果較前日加昻九元、做出交易、早市九千角、午市一萬三千角、廣東小洋早市爲七百四十五元三角、午市爲七百四十五元二角、結果較前日跌小一元七角、做出交易早市三萬五角、午市二萬五千角、銅元較前日回落一千文、如三百二十六千五百文、交易代價洋一萬零七百元、合數量三萬四千九百二十五串五百文、</p>

<h3>紐約股市初穩繼跌</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告云、昨股市初甚穩定、末後因國務卿赫爾出席參院時聲稱世界恐慌中、美國行將遭遇破天荒絶大之經濟危機、投機家咸呈悲觀、奮勇抛出、市况遂形低落、金融家亦籲請國會迅速通過關稅稅則法案、爲未雨綢繆之計、故市塲雖有良好消息、若鐵路工潮之和解等、終被掩蓋不彰、工業人造絲股票爲跌落最大者之一、計小五元餘、小交易亦跌、債劵起落無定、美國公債鬆落、據報告（證劵）賣風雖熾、抵抗甚力金屬與特種股受擊最重、（小麥）產况消息繼續可驚、西北仍旱、以地位論極利買方、空方行將徒勞而力拙也、（棉花）通貨膨脹之可能性逐漸消沉、廠方抛出、紗布銷路遲慢、故有人謂紗廠行將减工、據報告云、農民對各人應減種之份發生不滿、多頭顯已大量了結、惟市面仍有動搖不安之象、進展猶待新激勵、（砂糖）市况淸平、現貨仍有進步、（橡皮）收盤挺秀、廠商購進、似將續高、（白銀）上海與倫敦瘦弱、故晨初跌落頗巨、後因五月期竟日有人支持、乃起反動、全日成交一百六十四萬股、茲將道瓊斯掻數列後、</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗花又轉軟落　—今日交割停市—</h3>
<p>紗市仍屬平澹之象、惟多數人心依然觀低逢漲抛賣者仍衆、故壓力尙重、但查　來華南華北買去期現紗約有二三萬包之巨、廠方鬆動不少、不過買去十支十六支粗紗占多數、交易所倉庫中的存貨、詢問者較鮮、標紗仍被壓迫、根本上存貨較前减少、</p>

<h3>美棉多頭了結而跌</h3>
<p>昨美棉市况、因大衆多頭了結、布疋市况不佳、南方賣出、市况極疲、結果現貨跌二十磅音、期貨跌十九磅音至二十一磅音、利物浦棉現貨跌十二點、期貨跌四點至七點、埃及棉現貨跌十一點、孟買棉市、始因歐洲出口商賣出而跌、後以投機家買進回漲、結果平加爾奥姆辣均跌三羅比、白羅溪跌三羅比二角半、原電錄左、（二十六日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　多頭了結期粉軟</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈鬆跌無已之象、洋麥報價、雖少上落、芝加哥祇好四分零、坎拿大小八分左右、但開價後、　業内外人心、依然一致不振、交易所之加證、已爲環境所衝破、良以此路諸帮、對於各種糧價、開空前之低落、以最近之粉價比較、終覺粉價尙在各種糧價之上、實銷帮之沉寂不前、諒屬此故、市面之　疲、亦非無因、迨至下午開盤、近期因多頭亟求了結、又見鬆落、遠期亦因客帮回出、及人心之虚疲、亦見軟弱、觀察後步、恐仍屬難振之勢也、結果本月份又回跌二分、五六月份跌一分半、七月份跌一分二厘半、八月份跌五厘、九月份跌七厘半、</p>
<h3>期麥一致下挫</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈一致見疲之象、以洋麥報價、無甚上落、而天氣已轉晴和、一般人之推測、以爲照此天氣、　後之年收估計、大有豐收之兆、兼之各種糧價、均在不斷之低落時期、新麥旺令、難以看好、因此市面又復步步下落、市塲之抛　雖未暢、由環境之　迫、市勢終於疲滯也、結果六月份較跌三分、七月份跌二分、八月份跌四分、餘無比較、現麥因廠　不動、仍　住未開、</p>
<h3>河下米市平定</h3>
<p>（河南）昨日各帮來源二十餘號、（四千餘　　　）其中晚稻居多、厚粳少數、客帮包　稍　　　　　南北洋兩帮共進千包左右、市况因售方　　、仍呈定局、各厚粳店　雖屬有　、伹以天陰、人心尙堅、市色亦見平定、杜洋尖及陰變元均無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地來源二十一二號、市上各貨銷路白粳高貨次、絞中關爲呆、埠尖杜尖客尖亦然、早稻勒價梢化、薄稻到貨不多、銷亦平常、白元羊尖尙稱活絡、陰元到銷兩平、市形白粳價短數分、羊尖薄稻高貨堅定、中次亦疲三五分、變元續修近角、埠尖疲軟之勢、杜尖客尖陰元價形穩固、</p>
<h3>客秈閩浙辦胃續暢　—小絞步漲三分—</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况、本有趨小之象、蓋來源旺湧、而去化减少故也、惟昨開市後福州胃口並不退化、反與新在市上顧問之浙省甬紹帮爭辦、泉州温台亦稍有少數應酬、全市成交七千三百三十八包、　省共去三千以上、浙省亦辦二千左右、其他均係三五百包之少數交易、浙帮注重中關機靖、閩省專重糙米、本街胃口不旺、辦少數機秈外、又成交陳小絞二百包、價開六元八角半、比前市大三分、其他各米行情均與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>黃荳暫無變化</h3>
<p>昨黃豆市况、暫居平定之勢、内地連日之胃、聞非正式銷化、爲此多係心思交易、故市雖緊張、胃不能聯、昨交易二百包、肥河豆勉立原盤「二元八角」所以人心略軟、此外廠家續辦穎州豆三車、價扯二元六角六、本街去肥河豆二車、價爲二元七角三及七角、</p>
<h3>絲茶浙屬春蠶發現蠶病</h3>
<p>杭紹「臨平」一帶農民、今届因早蠶出蟻不齊、咸起補育晚蠶、頭二眠中天氣晴暖、發育順利、三眠時天氣不正、忽雨忽寒、近兩日大雨不止、致蠶户飼葉不及、蠶食濕葉、發生空頭而腹洩、晚蠶亦食葉遲緩、口吐黑沬、指導員現正設法隔離、「餘姚」四鄕蠶事較晚、而農民一律孵育改良種、收蟻後指導員均採摘改良新桑葉、切碎飼蠶、更兼天氣良好、發育頗佳、早帮現已二眠足葉、晚帮亦二眠開葉多日、惜近數日中天氣寒冷繼以春雨連綿、温度較高、致起蠶病、蠶蟻行動呆笨、食慾驟减、間有下洩黃水、蠶户咸除去病蠶、以免傳染、「富陽」今届農民、春蠶飼蟻不足、出蟻後稚蠶飼料由指導員監督進行、經過良好、現正三眠旺葉、近兩日雨多晴少、加以天氣太寒、温度低而温度高、蠶體抵抗力薄弱、發現空頭、間有腹洩黑水、停食不眠、現狀不佳、「平湖」四鄕飼額不弱、土蠶　一律捨棄、均育改良種、並有指導員恊助飼育、開葉後發育頗佳、近兩日中春雨連朝、加以温度不高、稚蠶力弱、食葉遲緩、頭眠旺葉之蠶、大半僵伏蠶具、指導員現正設法調護、</p>
<h3>屯溪茶號增加</h3>
<p>屯溪茶業、邇來益形蓬勃、製銷洋莊綠茶莊號、新近添設二十四家、連原有茶號共有七十八家之多屯市及陽湖附近各處製茶莊屋、均已租賃凈盡、形勢異常熱閙、惟各鄕茶園、全未開採蓋因邇來天時寒冷茶身僅略露嘴、就現下情形觀察須俟立夏節邊方有新貨上市云、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮靑糖地價漲三角</h3>
<p>昨糖市以關金遞升二○五四、公會人氣甚佳、劃盤如二四粗砂白爲二十元○三角、比漲一角五分、成交百數包、九號ＫＮＧ嘜嗬赤喊十六元太古糖Ｂ嘜喊二十元○六角、均無做出、本廠一號綿白仍十八元六角、零星有交、國產潮靑昨接汕頭來電、報漲三角、原因爲靑島帮搜辦存底已空、故囑申貨暫時止兌、聞號方業已報緊喊漲、雷州赤砂開出六十餘包、價爲十三元、香港所來白片糖、前曾開過十七元八角、日前續到二百餘包、已經見樣、其貨頗佳、緣連日關金步升、成本增昻、故貨主非加價不兌、</p>
<h3>南北　貨金針菜突漲二元</h3>
<p>金針菜近以行號存底均薄、且連日廣潮兩帮熱烈採辦、號盤遂致扳緊、昨開數十包、價爲十七元六角、十八元、行家售盤亦比較突升二元有奇、據鎭江來函報稱存底不滿二百包、總計上海行號在内亦祗八九百包、照業中人推測、此去銷日方長、距出新時間尙卑、如各帮銷路再活、市價有看二十元以上之可能、</p>
<h3>蘭花米高貨仍缺　—色次貨依然少受—</h3>
<p>蘭花子以前到色澤次劣、問津者却步、尙未售通、號盤雖陸續曾有開出、但價格均屬低廉、聞最高貨價祇三十七八元、次自三十四五元至三十二三元不一、同日前太原輪有到十三彩、已經見辦、惜係仍飛上乘貨、故尙無對手云、</p>

<h3>最近的對日外交</h3>
<p>— 姑射</p>
<p>最近的對日外交，要算是民國二十三年來我國所逢到的最困難的難關，情勢最緊迫的一個外交局面了。日本是要整個呑下中國，英美則要共同平均分割，而中國的民衆，所要求的，則是反帝與抗日。問題的困難，就在這里。我們的政府，怎樣去應付這一空前的危急局面，以渡過這一從來未有的難關呢？這是很可注意的。</p>
<p>日本的希圖獨呑中國，這一陰謀，本不自今日始，老早就是日本對中國整個的策劃了。至於今日，這一策劃，就更表現到了最高度。華北的軍事控制，國聯技術合作的反對，以至於最近的日外務省的聲明，差不多已把日本對中國的陰謀，整個揭開到最最明白的地位。而最近日本在國際間的活動，對我國的種種恐嚇與强制，更把這一陰謀，表現到酷辣無餘。眼前我們只看見日本的一雙外交魔手，怎樣儘量在擺布着整個的中國，而中國呢？可憐的在這下面，竟嚇到一聲不敢響。眼看我們只有跟着他怎樣講便怎麽講了。這情形，簡直極人世未有之慘，開拓了一個國際間從來未有的悲慘局面。</p>
<p>一方，在國際間，則有英美各國對中國權利的鬭爭。他們都想在中國得到一份很好的財產，而這財產，現在正爲各國所爭奪着，日本尤其是野心最大的一個。怎樣在中國特别得到更豐富的財源，更優美的地帶，這是他們所日夜焦心苦慮，去籌劃着的。日本是今日中國眞正的宰制者、英美各國要在中國都能分得一杯羹，就非先驅除日本不可。因此，歐美列强，與日本在中國的衝突，就更激烈了。特别是美國，尤與日本立在了利害最尖銳的敵對地位。這樣，形成了九一八以來遠東方面的緊張局面。而在這鬭爭局面之下，盡量的被他們所踐踏着的，則是我們可憐的中國。</p>
<p>國際的風雲，日緊一日。中國的被分割，其危機也一天高漲一天，一天尖銳一天。立在這可怕的局面之下的中國，其出路究竟在那里呢。</p>
<p>據最近汪院長的報告，我國外交方針，决不變更，對日决不屈服，這話當然很對，我們單願政府當局能够如此。「實爲玉碎，不爲瓦全」，這是我們政府當局當今所應取的態度。否則，隨便因日本之恐嚇而就屈伏，那才眞會把整個中華民族，陷於萬刦不復之地。</p>
<p>一方，我們對中國一般民衆，更致其無窮之希望。這樣一個難關，我無條件的相信，只有中國民衆，只有中國一般人民的力量，才能打開。不要悲觀，我們民衆們的力量，終有一天，會取得我們中華民族的復興。國際帝國主義可怕的魔手的宰割，怕什麽呢？最後的勝利，一定還是由我們而獲得。金融資本下的帝國主義，終有一天要人倒台，而目前，這金融資本的基礎，也早已坍塌到不堪的程度了。我們的勝利，就要在看他們拆台的工作呢。</p>
<h3>處世小論</h3>
<p>— 逸鷺</p>
<p>「多聞闕疑，愼言其餘，則寡尤；多見闕殆，愼行其餘，則寡悔。言寡尤，行寡悔，祿在其中矣。一在「論語新解」（見論語卅五期）的補註說是消極的干祿，又同文正義曰「多吃飯，少開口，自然飯有你吃的。」信哉斯言！但是，孔老夫子本就看到做人的艱難，便借着答子張學于祿，發揮敎人處世要有涵養——也可說修養——的更深一層寓意，却不可將它白白的埋沒了。孔夫子說話，往往有答非所問的妙用，如「惟考，友於兄弟，施於有政，是亦爲政，奚其爲爲政？」就和前答子張的幾句話，有異曲同工之妙。然則，夫子亦善於幽默者乎？</p>
<p>幽默，夫子固亦幽默矣，但尙未造其頂極。蓋所謂「其餘」者，仍是某種一向鬱積在胸中，或固執着的成見。雖經過「多聞」「多見」的修養，反有越發堅持的可能，並且，這種成見，不問可知：與人至少是不同道的。一旦將它說出來，做出來，在某種塲合將於「踢屁股階級」，的人　利，卽最低限度亦使人不高興。須知，說話做事，使人不高興，就是不利於自己；於人不利，則不啻自殺！那末，夫子說「愼言其餘」，「愼行其餘」的意思，還是贊許人：「其餘」是言言不妨的，行行也不妨，祇要小心就是了。然而，夫子那里知道竟有言不得行不得也哥哥的危險在呢？所以，夫子說話，總還有點直心直肚腸，他的不肯對子張說：「勿言其餘，則無尤，勿行其餘在則無悔，無尤，無悔，祿在其中矣。」始終是千古遣憾！</p>
<p>在這個年頭裏，說話做事眞是難極，若不說不做罷，何以謀生？當然辦不到的。卽使像「多吃飯，少開口，自然飯有你吃的，」也不過有口飯吃吃而已，那豈不成了個糞的製造機？於是，多吃飯之外，還得要多「開口」，多「動手」。然「開口」「動手」，須把「愼言其餘」「愼行其餘」的「其餘」全部掉開，另闢途徑。至於「另闢途徑」的法術，一語道破，也簡單得很，就是把固有情感抑制住了，毌使有活動的可能，說話做事都得聽從「理智」的指揮——直截的說：爲求處世方便起見，總得忍痛把「良心」束之高閣，莫讓它出現搗鬼。</p>
<p>於是，說出的話，就不是原來心理想說的，卽不致得罪人：做出的事，便不是原來心理想做的，也不致抵觸人。這樣，人家就高興，會歡迎你，得利了，會敬仰你。有了歡迎，有了敬仰，說者行者，不但「飯有你吃的」，且聲望日隆，妻財子祿一世享受不盡！利人事小，利己事大，那些拖泥帶水的良心心問題，究何用哉？而當今處世之道，「愼言其餘」，「愼行其餘」之不是效法，亦明矣。噫嘻！</p>
<h3>打魚殺家</h3>
<p>要俊再來訪蕭恩，蕭恩告知遭寃經過：李俊見蕭恩形容枯槁，萬分憂憤。李俟辭出蕭家，路遇桂英底未婚夫花逢春，告知一切，花逢春悲恨交集。</p>
<h3>醫院裏的一夜</h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>太陽已歛住了它的光輝，悄悄地向西方的地平綫下消逝去了，病室裏的一切簡單的陳設，已經瞧不大淸楚了。麻姑撑着抱病的身體，勉强地從床上坐起來，順手把垂在床頭的電綫捻着！讓深藍色的電燈吐出暗沉沉的灰白色的光綫。　　「他怎麽到這個時候還不見回來呢？」麻姑緊縐着眉頭暗暗地自語，心裏好像在熱鍋裏走着的螞蟻般的焦急難過；同時，因爲受不了刀割般的肚子的疼痛，她終於又鑽進被窩裏去了。</p>
<p>室内的空氣，死一般的沉寂。暗淡的燈光，射照着她那蜡似的黃臉，和兩盞深陷得像窟窿似的眼睛，格外地顯出可怕的憔悴。</p>
<p>麻姑在寂寞的病室裏的唯一的安慰，祇有一隻約莫三寸大小的橡皮製成的洋呱呱，她也不知道從什麽時候引起她對於小孩子有這樣的興趣和好感，連她自己想起來也有點茫然。不過當她萬感交集苦悶寂寞湧上心頭的時候，她非從潔白的枕頭底下把這隻小小的洋呱呱抱到懷裏來撫摸不可的，但是，她對着這戴着高高的紅帽子的洋呱呱，她的心又像給整千整萬的針在刺着般的難過。</p>
<p>當看護婦每次走進來爲她下藥的時候，她的心就她像被那兇惡的毒蛇蛟住一口似的疼痛，腦袋立時地會脹大起來，眼前一陣昏暗，天地好像千秋般在翻轉了。</p>
<p>「爲什麽我要做出這不負責任而又不人道的事情呢？」她緊閉着眼睛苦痛地對着自己發問，鼻子裏覺得一陣酸，珠子般的眼淚從眼角連串地淌下來。</p>
<p>「如果不是爲了經濟的困難，生活問題的沒有辦法解决的緣故，誰又願意毁壞了她的小生命呢！所以，這種責任應該歸之現社會組織的不良吧。」當她悲痛到不能悲痛的時候，她終於搖搖着幾下頭兒這樣的自慰着。</p>
<p>扶梯上的皮鞋聲「咯咯」的響着，她想：「也許是靑萍回來了。」接着，門開了，靑萍靜悄悄地縮着頭兒進來。</p>
<p>「靑萍，冷嗎？外面刮起風來嗎？</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>麻姑覺得靑萍的手冷冰冰得血都凝結了。</p>
<p>「是的。說不定還要下雨。」靑萍走到桌子前面把屁股移到橙子上面去，兩隻手撑着蓬鬆的頭兒在沉思着。</p>
<p>室内的空氣越發沉悶，在寒風包圍中。</p>
<p>「姑，肚子還會疼痛嗎？下午可有好好的睡？」靑萍終於抬起頭來破着沉寂的問着，眉是緊鎖的，額上縐得像馬路交义的電車軌。</p>
<p>「肚子還會陣陣在作痛。據醫生說　　「現在温度已經和平常人一樣了，明天就可以出院。」麻姑緩呑知地說。「萍，朋友可有找到沒有？錢怎麽·····」　「眞是倒霉，一連走了幾個地方，都是碰壁！」靑萍的頭兒是更低郵了。　　「那末，明天將怎麽辦呢？萍，我眞想悔，我不該聽你的話到這個地方來，把我倆的···」麻姑的喉頭好像給麵包塞住了，深陷的眼睛起了一陣潮濕，眼淚滔滔地滴到素白的枕頭上面去了。</p>
<p>「這又有什麽辦法呢，像我們這樣的生活？」</p>
<p>呼呼的寒風挾着陣陣的細雨，打得玻璃窗上滴滴答答地響着，好像爲這一對宻創了的靑年人嘆息······</p>

<h3>阿人</h3>
<p>是一個春日的　　，在螢火般的暗淡的燈光下，我望着　人家　忙的女僕「阿黃」她在　滾她流下熟　。</p>
<p>最近又遭了失業。她的命　也是够苦了吧！十五歲的時候做了人家的童養媳，在苛刻的公姑虐待之下生活，七年之久，此後命運之神　與她作劇，她的丈夫逝世了，所存的是白髮的公姑和嗷嗷待浦的孩子，於是憑着她的强健的身手來維持一家幾口的生活。但是這樣二年以來愛兒們夭折了，公姑相繼去世了，在這茫茫的世間，祗有她這孤苦的伶仃的可憐的，漂泊在天之涯海之角，而無人願問到他的一切一切了。</p>
<p>幾年寂寞的生活，她是孤獨地過去了，眼淚倒往肚裏呑着。爲着生活的鞭撻和禮敎的束縛，她終是受着主人殘酷的虐待而在非人的境遇之下生活着！</p>
<p>最近她又被解僱了，經不起薦頭店老　重大的剝削，因此祇有在相熟的較好的舊主人那兒暫住，正是在一個春日的黃昏，她尋找了一天的事而忽忙地來告訴我們一天的成續：「唉！我今天東奔西走忙了一天，連飯都沒有吃過，祇吃幾個大餅就算了事。唉！像我這樣的人可算是苦倒絶點了。假使我自己不去找事，老實說連我餓死亦是無人知道的。狐狸有洞，飛鳥有窠，而我呢！什麽都沒有，僅是一個天涯漂泊的遊民。今天我得到二個消息，一個是「阿張」告訴我說：她的鄰居某太太，一家共有四口，薪工每月五元，但聽說這是做替工的，並且要在明天晚上才聽一個回音；還有一個是說ＸＸ樓要招十名女招待，所以我已經答應，請人替我去報名了····」</p>
<p>「什麽？去當女招待，那你還是直接去賣淫好了。假使你去做的話，你五六年守節所獲得的名譽全失了；老黃！主意拿定，窮要淸窮，寗死不要去幹這種下賤的玩意兒。」隔壁周家媽媽聽見了阿黃說她要去做女招待，急得打斷了她的話柄而大發她的議論。</p>
<p>阿黃急得連忙提出抗議來：「呵！周老太太的意見雖然不錯，可是這——女招待也是職業的一種，我祗要淸白自愛那有什麽關係呢！至於什麽名譽，我已給這殺人不見血的桎梏，困了這我年了，現在我已覺悟我不敢再信任它了，它會使我肚餓和體凍的。呵！種種的束縛呀！它們對我們窮人是太嚴厲了，它是會剝消了我的生存的權利的·····」她悲憤得淚珠奪眶而出了。</p>
<p>「女招待是一種職業，這是誰都不可否認的，至於「操副業」這是個人的問題，這與職業有什麽關係？這究竟是一種可賺飯吃的職業，比强餓而死總說得通些。禮敎祗是處人以絶境的領域，而沒有爲人尋活的方法呀！·····」我在旁同情地對阿黃說着。</p>
<h3>學音學的</h3>
<p>— 榖穗</p>
<p>在我貼出十幾張像招租一般的招收提琴學生的廣告的第六天，我接得像下面我所描寫的奇異的客人：</p>
<p>蒼白的悽慘的面容，長頭髮，支在一身不整齊而且骯髒的服裝，態度也有些怪，突然以沙聲的喉頭發音：</p>
<p>「就是你敎授提琴麽？先生。」</p>
<p>我略一頷首。</p>
<p>「我可以請求你拉一曲，拉一曲「沙費尼」（著名提琴曲名）麽？」他的視綫從我的頭部往下移到我破皮鞋而滯呆在一角地板上。目光有些陰險。</p>
<p>這種請求，在一個不相識的，并且討人厭的口中吐出來，平時我一定嚴詞拒絶；但那時我窮得已斷炊一天，受到二房東限一禮拜内付淸宿欠房金的第三次警告了。我希望他是奉主人命來探究一下，預先在樂片上聽過「沙費尼」曲，要把我敎師的　　　　生人，然後把學生送上的。假使　　是對的，送一個學生來，再由學生介絶别個學生，二個，三個······於是我回前的困難就可解决了。</p>
<p>就是這個希望給我力氣來請調調絃拉起那曲悲切的「沙費尼」來。</p>
<p>弓在四條絃線上動起來，使我暫時忘却自前困頓的境界。音符一個個越過我的面前鑽入我的耳膜裏，一個比一個更悽愴。在這悽然的節奏裏，我笑然發覺有披雅娜的伴奏參入進來。和諧，合拍，使我暫時停弓去找尋那伴奏的音源，啊，就是站在我面前的奇怪的客人，他仰首哼着，合拍的和諧的音，從他的喉頭流了出來。</p>
<p>他就這般哼着，一直到曲終。我停下弓，發見他眼眶裏有淚。</p>
<p>「這年頭，音樂家是註定餓死的！」</p>
<p>他說着，輕輕嘘了一口氣，視線落在窗外。</p>
<p>這句話刺痛我的心。</p>
<p>「先生也拉提琴？」我問</p>
<p>「不，我不會拉，我的女人，他拉」</p>
<p>得很好；我只會彈鋼琴。」</p>
<p>「現在——」</p>
<p>「現在我的女人已在天上，爲了窮」</p>
<p>，沒得錢吃藥。」</p>
<p>「這是社會組織的不好，——」我有些悽然，正要發牢騷，他又發言了。　　「讓麽鬼咒詛樂片吧，慕維通吧，無線電吧，一般人的欣賞從我們這里移開了。」</p>
<p>片刻的靜默，空虚抓去我們的心。　　「再拉一次「沙費尼」，請求你，先生，給我再度回憶，我的女人。」</p>
<p>我惘然的拿起琴，一曲悽然的節奏又充滿了亭子間。</p>
<p>曲終，無力的放下琴，我不知道什麽時候這位奇怪的客人不别的走了。</p>
<h3>賣弄機關</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>在日常中，我們幾乎隨時隨地可以聽見「某某最善於賣弄機關」，的這末一句話。初初聽着似乎覺得莫明其妙。實則在如今這個年頭，這現象差不多已成爲一種風習。所謂賣弄機關也者，並沒有什麽深奥的哲理，簡單地說：就是做人的手段，但這手段要煆煉到爐火純靑，應用襝如的地步，却不是輕易的事，而是必須經過一番工夫的。同時這手段是存乎其人，有某人卽有其獨出心裁之巧妙，不是大人都能學而得之。雖然人人都想能如此就好，因然天下事常常是一回生，二回熟，一回上當二回便學乖，問題是全在於够工人不够工夫，够工夫的，可以通通路，左右逢源，不够工夫的，不特處處磁壁，無孔可攢，而且容易令人唾棄。所以如果自問你的賣弄機關的本領——做人的手段，尙未圓熟，則寗可還是有什麽說什麽，應做卽做，不必固作虚玄，露出馬脚，以致弄巧反拙，就大可不必了。然而今日的社會完全是一個明爭暗奪的局面，簡直可以說是一個騙局，充滿了虚僞，狡滑，欺詐，而惟這種人始能屹立不動，升官發財，以至於成爲被人歌功頌德的赫赫大人物。反之，如果你是一個初出茅蘆的絲毫不懂人情世故的稚子，則任你有如何高尙的美德，淹博的學問。那是絶無用途的。不但無由飛黃騰達，而且只有癟着肚皮，終生鬱鬱不得志的。</p>
<p>古人亦曾說「人情練達卽文章，」眞是道破一切，何况在目下如此這般的勢利社會，而賣弄機關也正是滲透人情學的做人的技倆，故賣弄機關實是處世第一大秘訣。如能領略個中底細，着於運用，則包你萬事順遂，無往不馬到功成。譬如說：與人交往，只可說三分話，不可和盤托出，交涉事件，應以一種模棱兩可的態度緩緩對付，不可一語切斷。其他如看風掛帆，見機轉舵，這些都是屬於賣弄機關的法門。</p>
<p>在今日，賣弄機關已變爲一種謀生立身的新道德，得之者則浮，浮卽生存；且可享榮華富貴之福；失之者沉，沉卽難立足，是故吾人，欲；圖存於社會，不可無賣弄機關之本領也，然而，世風蓋亦已日下者矣，嗚呼！</p>
<h3>一個夜晚</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>無限的烈火，在菲的心裏燃燒着，使他意識到每個細胞都在不停的浮動。　　房裏，是靜靜地，除去放在那台子上的小玻璃鐘底滴搭聲嚮以外，再不聽見一些旁的聲息。夕陽，從一抹的流雲裏露出了臉，庭前的樹影，斜掛在那窗子上，再印到房裏的墻頭，多柔和的春意嬆！</p>
<p>對着鏡子，菲把打好了的領結，又拆了下來—</p>
<p>—眞豈有此理，總不能挺起！於此，他重復的打結着。</p>
<p>穿好了大衣，再把肉色的香粉撲了些，鏡子裏，瞧，多美麗的一個面容呵！笑了，在艶紅的口唇裏，兩列齊楚的牙齒，閃着凈潔的光。</p>
<p>開始的，他在走着，地板上，奏着恊調的音律。</p>
<p>—怎麽還不來呢？新，眞慢，已經半個鐘頭了！不耐煩的，他望着台子上的鐘。香烟，在他的嘴裏呼着，烟霧裊裊地，是一羣小的圓圈，貫珠是的，呵，大了，不見了。</p>
<p>餘輝，很快的　過去，庭心，房裏，都泛瀾着一層模糊。當他倆偕同着，經過了齊楚的冬靑，踱出了校門的時候，路上的火炬已全部的明亮了。</p>
<p>慢慢地，慢慢地，沿着望不見戰時遺跡的神秘街頭，行着，行着。</p>
<p>一條瘦窕的身影，輕風是的閃過去—Ｏｈｌｈｏｗｂｉｇｔｈｅｂａｔｔｏｏｋｌ跟着，笑着，興奮着，不能制止的誘惑撲上了心頭。</p>
<p>怪惹人的，一條豐滿的火腿，不，不僅是大腿，在那大腿以上以至於肩膀，都是怪惹人的。心，在痒痒地，臉，也有點子熱，肚裏，好像有一盆火在燃燒！</p>
<p>扶着熱烈的心情，躥了進去，懷着無窮的企望，坐了下來。燈，滅了，一幕幕　，在眼前閃着，流波是的，過去了。膠，彷彿有點發重，身體也格外的周轉不靈；失望。是佔據了整個的心房　　出來，轉到Ｍ　　　Ｐａｌａｃｅｏ</p>
<p>，在吐着幽暗的光，溶在各個人的臉上，怪陰森的。那脚底下，節拍是多麽的細膩喲，淸脆嗎？哼，老人的嘆息！</p>
<p>在這裏，是不凖許時間有「寳貴」性的，有的，那只是企望。</p>
<p>離開ＭｏｏｎＰａｌａｃｅ的時候，春風吹拂着，輕鬆地，軟軟地，柔和的氣息，在蕩漾着。</p>
<p>—得，天晚了，還是找小陳吧！到大東去。</p>
<p>愉快籠罩着菲的心弦。第二天，在菲的日記簿上，有了這樣的幾句；</p>
<p>陶醉吧，良宵，</p>
<p>莫等待那明朝；</p>
<p>但，我多麽愚魯喲！</p>
<p>竟沒有把她的唇兒吮嚼！</p>
<p>···········</p>
<p>陶醉吧·良宵，</p>
<p>莫等待那明朝；</p>
<p>哦，我多麽難熬喲！</p>
<p>那肉體，使我的心旌搖搖。</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>陶醉吧，良宵，</p>
<p>莫等待那明朝，</p>
<p>呵，我多麽幸福喲！</p>
<p>接受着她的輕　，淺笑。</p>

<h3>婦人心</h3>
<p>— 小岑</p>
<p>我的朋友，她有一次在我的房間忽然對我說：</p>
<p>「你來，你來，輕輕的把門關上吧！」</p>
<p>「什麽事要把門關上？」我問。</p>
<p>「我要告訴你，非把門關上不好說的！」</p>
<p>我照她的意思把門眞的關緊了。她很怕羞似的用手把我一拉，推到床上去，再把氈子一掀，蓋到我的頭上，當時我給她給了一驚，莫明其所以然，她還要緊圍着我的頭頸，把自己的面向下伏着，才開始說；「我要告訴你····我要····告訴你。」告訴什麽她始終又說不</p>
<p>出來，我給她的氈子悶死快了，眞想發脾氣。但爲着好奇心，我又問她究竟想向我說什麽？她說：「唔·····唔，我想和你商量，我眞苦呀！他們都愛我，他們要我最後的答覆，我不知道愛誰好呢！」</p>
<p>我說：「你愛誰多一點就愛誰好了，這有什麽難？」</p>
<p>「各有各的可愛，你敎我怎樣辦呢？你知道！一個是大學畢業生，現在某中學當敎務主任，思想很好，文章也寫得漂亮，但他長得一面胡子，他又是我的外甥，雖然年紀比我大，他愛我是從童年的時候，我想一朝拒絶了他的愛，他眞會鬧出自殺的慘劇，若是接受了他的愛，那麽我們非抛離家庭不行，那時候我的母親，你想她將如何的傷心？還有父親和自己的名譽會變成怎樣？我們逃開家庭後的生活情形又將如何了局？自己是不是抵受得住饑寒的壓迫？这種種問題都在我的腦筋裏面盤旋。」</p>
<p>「還有一個，他是很靑輕的，長得也漂亮，家裏很有錢，可是他的學識很淺，很浪漫，連自己父親的愛妾也和她發生種種艶事，不過，我爲着學校的風潮，要避免和人家衝突才住在他家裏，有一次我和他的妹妹從外邊買東西回來的時候，他總愛等候在家裏，聽見呌門的聲音，他不但要親自替我們開門，還要替我接住我們手上的東西，在我的身邊纏綿，你看他是多麽可愛喲！」</p>
<p>到底她是怕吃苦，慕錢貎，不久以後在上海和這位有財之子結婚了，我和她碰頭，她邀我到公園去玩，她的聲調已經和從前不同，很沉悶的說：「我們結婚以前，他是怎樣的服侍我，現在他天天穿的拖鞋非要我替他拿不行了，還有伯伯的妻子天天要露臉色，說我是自由女，那是敎人敎難受，我要出來敎書自己找生活，他們又不肯，從前我對你說的外甥，他現在在中國文壇上已經成了名，你看！」</p>
<p>「朋友！你的内心很後悔了嗎」我說　　「滾你的！誰告訴你後悔？誰願意嫁給那胡鬚公？」她突然向我發脾氣，眞是想不到，她這樣新理由的斥我。回家後，我自然不能忘記這回受辱的事情，但，我還得用沉默的態度去理解她，她的心確是痛苦的，她想不讓朋友知道她是在懺悔，她流露了她内心的積鬱，說時又希望朋友不明白她的自述，這裏就可以以看出她當時嫁給有錢的少爺完全是一種虚榮心，羨金錢，愛美貎，不嫁給她的外甥是受着封建思想的束縛，今日之痛苦與自悔，因爲她根本是一個大學生，她有新的理想，她受不住舊家庭的壓迫，和金錢支配的痛苦。在一個封建社會生長而在資本主義社會受敎養的女子，雖然明白了她自己的苦悶，但是除不了本身階級的虚榮性，所以還要向朋友發一下掩飾的脾氣，最後我敢說，婦人心是有階級性的，她的心理完全是由於社會環境所養成。在某一個階級裏面有某一種婦人心的存存，尤其在兩個不同的社會裏面，婦人心更不能一致而論。</p>

<p>同時接到校中開學通知書和藴姊的信。</p>
<p>我這學頭老了好幾個優等，開學日子胡校長一定撫了我的頭髮奬勵我幾句，這眞是値得喜歡的事。我巴巴跑去告訴媽，媽好像沒有聽見一般，自顧做她的事。我扭到她的身上去，她纔說：「阿鶯，下半年不要去讀了，你婆家已擇定日子，快在家裏趕些針綫罷。」我半嚮注視着媽的面上，因爲她是喜歡說笑話的，但是今天好像不見得是笑話。我不知想起了什麽傷心的事跑向房裏撲在牀上哭了。</p>
<p>我心中眞像一束亂麻一樣。想起我不能讀書了，我不能時常和藴姊在一起了，我還要離開我的媽，同時想到我從沒有見過面的他—那個要做我丈夫的人，是個怎生模樣？而且也自然的想到他，媽不是說有他這般的女婿就好了嗎，那末，爲什麽不把我嫁了他，而要嫁一個我所不認識的男子呢？那個可愛又可怕的夢境，又在我心上軸轤般的旋轉，我不能嫁一個我不愛的男子作爲丈夫。不知他也知道了這消息沒有，爲什麽已好多天沒有來了，他知道我要出嫁了嗎·····？我哭得換不過氣來，這樣愛我的媽，她忍心把女兒一學個一切都不知的道所在嗎？</p>
<p>好像背後有個人影，果然他已拍着我的肩頭，我暫時停了抽噎，是媽的聲音，那樣低低的說：「阿鶯，你爸死了後，我養到你這般長大，自然捨不得你離開。不過，孩子，女孩子大了總要婆家去的，你仍可以當常回來，不是像在家裏一樣，而且多一個人也使我歡喜。你不看見大姊嫁了很快活嗎？現在要生小孩子了。快些，孩子，别哭，哭了媽心裏也不她過的，阿鶯！」媽將我身體抱起來，拍着我，拿手帕替我拭乾了眼淚，「阿鶯，媽也捨不得你呢！」她眞像抱小孩子似的把我抱在懷中。媽是愛我的，不過，我對着她的臉說不出一句話來，我應該怎樣對媽說呢？</p>

<h3>Japan's [Declaration] Still Not Officially Issued: International Situation Turns Chaotic; US Agrees with Related Countries Not to Be Bound by It; Britain Will Do What Is Appropriate, France Adopts a Bystander Attitude</h3>
<p>(Washington) It seems confirmed that the U.S. government is unwilling to protest the declaration issued by the Japanese government, at least for the time being. The U.S. also appears unwilling to broadly consult with the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. It is the U.S.'s intention to negotiate with Japan solely through diplomatic channels, which it is unwilling to do. Even if the countries concerned jointly discuss it, the U.S. does not want to be the first to propose it. Approximately, the U.S. will only jointly register the declaration issued by the Japanese government with one or several other countries, while declaring that each country itself is not bound by this unilateral declaration, and that</p>
<p>all the rights of these countries in the international arena remain maintained. Washington sources say that the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a declaration to the Tokyo press representatives nine days ago, but the formal documents are still awaited by the governments of various countries. Presumably, the State Department or the U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo may have already received this document. (Havas Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government officials and foreign envoys continued to negotiate here today. Secretary of State Hull met with President Roosevelt at the White House for more than an hour. Under Secretary of State Phillips met with British Ambassador Lindsay. Afterwards, the British Ambassador acknowledged that he had extensively studied the overall situation in the Far East with the Under Secretary, leading observers to believe that the government is now planning a unified Anglo-American response to Japan. Diplomats who visited the State Department these past two days to discuss the situation included Chinese Minister Shi Zhaoji, Italian Ambassador Rosso, French Ambassador Laboulaye, and Dutch Minister de Weede. (National News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, those close to diplomatic circles here widely rumored that Britain and the United States have already established an informal understanding, preparing to adopt a "dual-track approach" to deal with Japan. Although this news is trusted by those close to government circles, officials remain noncommittal to reporters' questions. According to reliable sources, the coordination between Britain and the United States is based on Britain's</p>
<p>Ambassador to the U.S. Lindsay's conversation with the U.S. State Department this Wednesday. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) This evening, British Ambassador Lindsay met with Deputy Secretary of State Phillips to discuss the overall situation in the Far East for half an hour. It is reported that the British Ambassador submitted a copy of the British government's note to Japan to Phillips, explaining Britain's position. According to a key source, the United States has not taken any concrete action on this matter so far. The U.S. has not sent any official documents to Japan or other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, nor has it indicated that it will take any action soon. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt discussed Japan's policy towards China with Secretary of State Hull today for a little over an hour. Hull reported on the general international situation, with a focus on the Japan issue. When leaving the White House, he did not express his opinions to reporters. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Tactics and Prospects for the International Situation; Japan Evades Officially Submitting Formal Documents, Causing European and American Countries to Feel Lost</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a key figure familiar with the diplomatic situation, various countries are paying close attention to the informal statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 17th. They have successively instructed their diplomatic representatives in Japan to inquire with the Japanese Foreign Ministry about the true meaning. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has evaded the issue, claiming that the statement was made informally to the press and is not important, and has consistently refused to publish the original text, making it difficult for countries to fully understand the content and true meaning of the statement. Currently, some European and American countries are still considering it in detail due to a lack of understanding of the true meaning, while a small number of countries with little stake in the Far East remain silent and observe. Britain and the United States, however, attach great importance to it. In addition to Britain instructing its ambassador to Japan to present an oral note of inquiry to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the U.S. government has maintained a silent observation of the matter. Recently, since Secretary of State Hull returned to Washington, the atmosphere has suddenly become tense. In addition to discussing countermeasures with President Roosevelt, he has also invited the diplomatic representatives of the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty in the U.S. to talk and exchange opinions. It is expected that the U.S. authorities will soon issue a concrete declaration, clarifying U.S. policy, or, like Britain, instruct its foreign minister in Japan to raise questions with the Japanese diplomatic authorities. It is predicted that the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty may soon jointly express their attitude. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Content of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations; British Ambassador Firmly Expresses to Hirota: Maintaining Treaty Rights and Obligations toward China</h3>
<p>(London) Today's London Times reported that, according to a report received from External Affairs Minister De Lai, the British Ambassador, at a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on April 25, clearly stated that Britain maintains its rights under various treaties concluded with China and complies with its obligations under multilateral conventions concerning China. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office today disclosed the content of Wednesday's meeting between British Ambassador to Japan Lindsay and Foreign Minister Hirota. It is said that the British Ambassador firmly stated to the Japanese Foreign Minister that Britain insists on all rights stipulated in its treaties with China and will not abandon its various obligations under multilateral conventions related to China. Today, Lord Privy Seal Eden, in response to questions whether the government had requested Japan to provide a detailed explanation of the supply of fighter jets, loans, or other assistance to China, stated that any policy of the British government has never endangered peace in the Far East. The purpose of British policy is to avoid such dangers, so the allegations made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry are unfounded. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) A diplomatic reporter for the Morning Post stated that British Ambassador to Japan Lindsay has explained to the Japanese government that Britain cannot recognize as legal any unilateral action that could alter the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees the territorial and administrative integrity of China. Britain fully adheres to the Open Door Policy stipulated in the treaty. The British government believes that, under this treaty, Japan's interests in China are also fully protected. Therefore, Britain finds it difficult to recognize as legal any act that alters or violates this treaty. The Morning Post also stated that, according to sources in Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota did not speak out against this statement of principles. Therefore, as far as the British government is concerned, there is no longer any reason to pursue this matter. Officials believe that Ambassador Lindsay's negotiations, which clarified Britain's attitude, have salvaged a situation that could have become more tense. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) When Foreign Secretary Simon states the British government's attitude on the Far Eastern issue to the House of Commons next Monday, he will report to the House on the results of British Ambassador to Tokyo Lindsay's visit to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota. However, it is generally believed that, since Britain has had contact with the Japanese government, there will be no further action. Britain's attitude towards the Far Eastern issue and its rights obtained under various treaties have already been explained to Japan. As for any country unilaterally abrogating various treaty agreements that stipulate the status of the powers in China, the United States has also declared its opposition. Washington has made similar representations to Japan. It currently appears that no further statements will be made. It is generally believed that other signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty, if they deem it appropriate, can follow the British and American precedents and each</p>
<p>declare their rights. As far as Britain is concerned, it does not want to take a joint action to deal with</p>
<p>Japan, as it fears that this would excessively expand the incident without any benefit. The fact that British Ambassador to the U.S. Lindsay limited himself to exchanging information during his visit to the White House shows that Britain's concerns are very serious.</p>
<p>(Havas Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>France Temporarily Keeps Silent; Not Understanding the True Meaning, Awaiting British and American Actions</h3>
<p>(Paris) Since the Japanese government issued a declaration explaining its</p>
<p>policy towards the Far East, especially China, officialdom has been extremely silent. Although the Japanese Foreign Ministry's declaration has been repeatedly supplemented and explained afterwards, the true purpose of Japan remains difficult to grasp. However, since those in charge have made no indication, it is clear that France does not intend to take any action before Britain and the United States act, as Britain and the United States have a more direct relationship with the Far Eastern issue. (Havas Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>Kerensky's Remarks: A Major War in the Far East is Inevitable; Soviet Russia is Powerless</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, Kerensky, in an interview with an Associated Press reporter, stated that the center of the world's tense political situation has shifted from Europe to China, so a major war in the Pacific is inevitable. Kerensky was the leader of the first Russian government after the Tsar's abdication and is now in exile in France. Kerensky declared that Soviet Russia cannot be a major player in any Far Eastern war. Soviet Russia, threatened by Japan, may agree within a year to establish a demilitarized zone on the border with [Manchukuo]. As for which countries will participate in the Pacific War, Kerensky did not specify. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Changes Tone: New Interpretation of Foreign Ministry Declaration; Suddenly Desiring to Base Itself on the Four-Power Banking Consortium Agreement, From Hegemony to Equal Sharing of Interests?</h3>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Saito issued a declaration, saying that the statement issued by the spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Ministry has caused a worldwide shock. He hopes that people around the world will remain calm and strive for a fair understanding. He believes that if the Foreign Ministry's statement had come from the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister, there would have been fewer opportunities for misunderstanding. Saito also explained the reason why the Foreign Ministry spokesman made this statement, saying that many foreign reporters were asking why Japan opposed China borrowing foreign loans for construction based on the League of Nations' expert plan. The Foreign Ministry responded with this statement. Saito continued, saying that he has not sent any official documents to the State Department, nor does he intend to make any further explanations regarding Japan's views. Then he said that the activities of the League of Nations' experts in China are unsatisfactory to the Japanese government. Saito further stated, [Japan believes that foreign loans to China must be channeled through the American, British, French, and Japanese banking consortium responsible for China's construction. Although China opposes Japan joining this group, Japan will insist on this.] Japan has no intention of violating the Nine-Power Treaty, but foreign loans to China should not be used for military purposes. (Havas Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>Glimpses of British and American Public Opinion: Japan Becomes the Focus of Universal Condemnation; The World Cannot Allow its Usurpation, The United States Has a Particularly Direct Relationship</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Washington, 26th Telegram: The Star Evening News editorial stated that although the international community has not taken any united steps in response to Japan's shocking statement, it will gradually turn Japan into the focus of universal condemnation. The world cannot ignore Japan's provocation, nor can it allow its usurpation and abandonment of internationally stipulated rights and interests in China. The United States has fundamental legal and direct interests in this matter. Japan's policy, in both its wording and spirit, is inconsistent with the Open</p>
<p>Door Policy, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris. Countries whose privileges are infringed upon and restricted cannot tolerate this policy. Regardless of its past successes, Japan must realize that its imperialistic ambitions have a limit. Exceeding this limit will inevitably be unacceptable to Western countries. Japan has already reached this limit by declaring Asia to be Japan's Asia. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The News Chronicle commented on the Far Eastern issue, believing that Japan's attitude, even when explained in the most moderate way, would inevitably lead to complete chaos if put into practice. The newspaper said, [Even if what Japan opposes is limited to the sale of armaments to China, it cannot be considered reasonable. Although selling armaments is not a good thing, it is better than preventing a weak country from defending itself. In short, what Japan is declaring is a superficial statement, but the actual issues it contains are very serious. Japan uses China's unstable political situation as an excuse for intervention, but the Chinese government, in the midst of ongoing floods and various difficulties created by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, can still resolutely govern most of China's territory. The difficulties it has overcome are worthy of praise. Aside from humanitarian reasons, we still hope that China will become increasingly peaceful and prosperous, and become a good customer of ours. However, the prosperity of China that we hope for is precisely what Japan fears.] (Havas Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>Arichi Rushes to Tokyo to Discuss China Policy with Hirota</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to China Arichi Akira is scheduled to arrive in Beijing tomorrow morning. According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Arichi will report to Foreign Minister Hirota on the content of his meeting with President Wang, the way to resolve various pending issues between China and Japan, and suggest China policies. Foreign Minister Hirota plans to have Arichi make more contact with the authorities of the Army and Navy Ministries to exchange opinions on China policy, and then decide on a new China policy with Foreign Minister Hirota. Because the statement on the 17th aroused international criticism, the release of the new policy will be announced after careful consideration. (Chinese United Press, 27th)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan: Secretly Discussing Diplomatic Countermeasures; Xiao Shuyu Suggests Four Points; Liu Guanxun Presents Three Strategies; Decision to Submit for Review and Then Discuss</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the routine meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 27th was completed, member Xiao Shuyu made a temporary motion, saying that the Sino-Japanese diplomatic issue has recently become tense. After the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a declaration on China on the 17th of this month, its attitude became even more explicit. At this critical moment of survival, it is insufficient to rely solely on diplomatic responses from our government. There must be basic measures to unite the government and the people in order to overcome difficulties. I have several opinions on this and would like to submit them to the Yuan for recommendation to the central government for adoption and implementation. The chairman then announced a closed-door meeting and ordered the recorders and all audience members to leave the venue, after which Xiao continued to state the meaning of the motion and put forward four points of opinion. A. Regarding the government: 1. Since the September 18th Incident, the country appears to have been unified on the surface, but in reality it is not. Now that the diplomatic situation is serious, take this opportunity to abolish the two Southwest organizations to show the necessity of true unity. 2. Now that the country is in imminent danger, national defense construction and economic construction are extremely important. Although the government speaks of production construction and seeks unification through construction every day, there is still little practical manifestation. If building some roads is considered fulfilling its responsibility, it falls far short of the essence of construction. I believe that in order to achieve success in economic construction, human and financial resources should be concentrated to unify authority. B. Regarding people's navigation: 1. The government should launch a national savings campaign to arouse people's savings. Those with assets should save more, and those without assets should save less. Even if each person saves one or two jiao, it is not impossible. At the same time, investigate bank deposits and draw 5% or 10% to help save the country. As for the purpose, supervision, and management, the government and the people can jointly take responsibility. 2. The government should select strong men from all over the country and provide them with military training so that they have the ability to defend themselves and the country. This point can be gradually promoted by referring to the phased training method in Guangxi. After stating this, the motion was written in writing and co-signed by eight members including Chen Changheng, and submitted to the chairman for review. At this point, member Liu Guanxun also stood up and moved, saying that Japan has opposed economic cooperation between the powers and us, and declared its contempt for international conventions and insult to our country's sovereignty. It is tantamount to placing us under Japanese protection. If we do not actively open up diplomatic channels and impose severe sanctions, we are at risk of being bound by it and perishing. Three strategies for diplomatic use are proposed: 1. Arouse the people to strive for progress, 2. Order overseas envoys to actively engage, 3. Urge the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to pay attention to Japan's attitude and request suggestions from the Central Political Council for adoption. After Liu spoke, Chen Changheng, Dai Xiujun, Wang Changxiang, Gu Zhenggang, and more than ten other members also expressed their opinions. After two hours of discussion, it was decided to submit the two proposals made by Xiao and Liu for review first. The chairman appointed Fu Bingchang, Liu Guanxun, Liang Hancao, Gu Zhenggang, Ma Yinchu, Zhong Zixin, Xiao Shuyu, and seven other members to review, with Fu Bingchang as the convener. It adjourned at 12:00 noon. It is reported that the designated reviewers have scheduled a review meeting to be held at the Legislative Yuan next Wednesday afternoon to formulate concrete opinions and submit them for discussion and decision at next week's routine meeting. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang of the Executive Yuan interviewed Legislative Member Lou Tongsun on the 27th to solicit his opinions on Japan's statement on the 17th, as well as the tendency of various countries to express sympathy for our country, and our country's countermeasures. Lou made some statements. Wang inquired about the situation in Fujian Province and asked Lou to take the time to go to Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Xiamen, and other places to assist in handling matters.

<h3>International Assistance and National Self-Salvation</h3>
<p>Is the current national crisis facing our Chinese nation yet to reach its most critical stage? If it is said to have reached its most critical stage, then how should it be dealt with? This is indeed an issue that our 400 million compatriots should pay strong attention to after Japan's repeated arrogant declarations. Historically speaking, since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has risen from the islands, seizing Taiwan, conquering Korea, and defeating Imperial Russia. While other powers have watched with concern as it bullied our country, Japan's ambition has not diminished. Later, taking advantage of the European War, it intensified its aggression. The Twenty-One Demands were still not enough to satisfy its desire for annexation. What was the threat to our nation's survival like? In the current state, Japan, surrounded by various powers, is the first to implement measures to disrupt the balance of power in China, seizing the four eastern provinces and then proceeding to control the entire relationship between China and various countries. The meaning of Japan's declaration this time is to place the entire country of China under its protection, relegating our Chinese nation to an irrecoverable state. This gluttonous ambition is not just a matter of affecting the rights of one or two powers in China. Now that our country is facing an ever-expanding national crisis, those who rely on foreign aid all believe that the Japanese disregard is enough to offend Britain and the United States and incur the antipathy of the League of Nations. The powers will inevitably take measures to sanction it. This kind of mentality of not seeking self-salvation but relying solely on foreign aid is insufficient to speak of the way of national consciousness. However, when the country is at its most critical and dangerous time, on the one hand, it is to urge national awakening and concentrate all efforts to seek a united front against the enemy. However, on the other hand, the use of diplomacy should not be completely abandoned. If there is a glimmer of opportunity to use, then all efforts should still be made. Even with this Sino-Japanese issue, let us speak of the current situation. Japan relies on its powerful military force and is claiming to establish hegemony in the Far East. If the League of Nations wants to complete the mission of Rahman coming to China after its prestige has fallen to the ground, it must unite the forces of Britain and France and use the aid of the United States to impose heavy military pressure on Japan. However, with that warlike Japanese clique, they will not hesitate to fight. At this point, are Britain, the United States, and France willing to take a gamble? This is what people doubt. Furthermore, looking at the current international situation, if you want international unity to put pressure on Japan, there must be common interests at stake. The UK accounts for 60% of foreign investment in China, the US accounts for 10%, and France accounts for even less. This is the first point that makes it impossible to act together. Joint sanctions against Japan by various countries must be free from worries to boost their courage to fight as a market. However, the finances of Britain, the United States, and France are becoming increasingly impoverished, and social unrest is becoming increasingly serious. The situation in Europe is also unstable. With this concern, it is even more difficult to act together. The Japanese understand this, so they dare to use such a ruthless approach and are willing to do everything possible to place our nation in iron shackles and make it submit in order to maintain its so-called East Asian peace policy. This is indeed a statement that insightfully recognizes the general trend of the powers. We have nothing to criticize. However, does this mean that if there is such disappointment in diplomacy, diplomatic means cannot be used? The countries of Europe and America are indeed difficult to carry out united sanctions because of differing interests and internal concerns. However, the interests of various countries in the Far East are actually very large. Although there are currently differences, it can be said that they have a global relationship. Those powers truly do not have any sympathy for us, but they are also unwilling to sit idly by and watch Japan become so powerful that it cannot be contained. Just look at the panic in the opinion circles of various countries after Japan issued its declaration, and you can know that the powers have not completely stopped considering this issue. If there is this concern, there is the possibility for our diplomatic activities. For example,</p>
<p>when a person is seriously ill, if there is a way to try, they will do their best to try it. Our diplomatic proposition is the same.</p>
<p>However, we must be clear that our nation has fallen into the final crisis of extinction. Since diplomatic assistance is only one in ten thousand hopes and cannot be expected, the only way out to fight for the survival of the nation is to launch a national self-defense to fight. Those who are determined to save the nation should rise up quickly.</p>
<h3>The Southwest Political Council Vigorously Denounces the Japanese Declaration and Sends a Telegram to the League of Nations and the Signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty; Hu Hanmin Issues a Document to Friendly Nations</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tang Shaoyi, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zheru, Chen Jitang, and Li Zongren, permanent members of the Southwest Political Council, telegraphed the League of Nations and the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty on the 27th regarding the Japanese Foreign Ministry's declaration on the 17th, issuing the following statement: (1) The nature of the Japanese declaration is tantamount to saying that China's friendly relations with any country must be approved by Japan. This not only insults China's independence but also despises the credibility of international treaties. China is an independent country, and its friendly relations with various countries are inherent rights and powers that no other country should interfere with. If the Japanese declaration becomes a reality, it is not only China's security and independence that will be harmed, but the Open Door Policy, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations will all be eliminated. (2) Japan is plotting to implement a kind of Monroe Doctrine toward China. We believe that the League of Nations and the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty must strictly deny the Japanese declaration and state that the Chinese people's desire is to build a unified peace. Although China has not completed it, in fact, the current situation of China's unification is more advanced than it was ten years ago. If it were not for Japan's promotion of internal warfare in China, China's unification and peace would have been achieved long ago. Therefore, we hope that the League of Nations and various countries will assume their treaty obligations and prevent any country from interfering in China's internal affairs. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After Hu Hanmin delivered his diplomatic remarks on the 27th, he also issued a document to friendly nations on the Far Eastern issue, saying that Japan is taking advantage of the fact that Britain, the United States, and Russia cannot agree to take the opportunity to monopolize the Far East, annex China, and exclude other countries from the Far East. For the sake of its own survival, China will do its utmost to strive for it and hopes that Britain, the United States, and Russia will work together to safeguard the dignity of international treaties and not just sit and talk but rise up and act. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Political Council decided to send Zou Lu or Deng Qingyang to Hong Kong on the 28th to solicit Hu's opinion on Japan and at the same time telegraphed Tang Shaoyi to come to the province for a face-to-face discussion. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>The Panshi Righteous Army Defeats a Japanese Army Unit; The Japanese Army Sets Fire to Villages</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Jilin News: Hundreds of righteous soldiers were discovered on the 16th of this month in the Dongbei Fanmaizi area of Panshi County. The leader has not been named. The Japanese army dispatched the Horie squad to attack, but they were defeated by the righteous soldiers. They took their anger out on the villages, saying they were a haven for bandits, and set fire to the entire village. Hundreds of people who escaped were shot dead by the head. Righteous soldiers were discovered in Chaihe on the Jihai Road, and their momentum was great. They were approaching Jilin City. The Japanese army transferred the Takada unit of Xinmin to defend. Because the puppet state confiscated the firearms of the people in Heilongjiang, the people of the thirteen counties in Donghuang formed large platoons and cooperated with each other to resist the puppet army. Recently, a regiment of the Japanese army from the 14th Division stationed in Heihe took a boat from Harbin to assist Wang Shutang's brigade of the puppet army in attacking.

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jitang's representative Yang Zhao came to Beijing. According to him, 1. The recent declaration of the Southwest on the North China issue was advocated by some members of the Central Committee. The Guangdong Provincial authorities did not participate. 2. The issue of the existence and abolition of the two Southwest organizations was previously moved, but subsequently</p>
<p>because it was during the period of bandit suppression, there was no need to make major changes, and it has been temporarily shelved. 3. The finances of the Southwest are still difficult, and there is no way to remedy them in the short term. Yang has not returned to Guangdong recently. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Force Planning Permanent Station at Xifengkou, Japanese Find Suitable Housing, Japanese Troops Arrive at Gubeikou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, a Japanese police officer named Zhou Qiaorenbao, from the puppet border police force, led 30 Japanese soldiers from Pingquan, Rehe, by car to Xifengkou. Zhou Qiao then inquired at the Public Security Bureau and the town office whether there were any vacant houses, planning to establish a border police team at Xifengkou, with 30 policemen stationed permanently. The response was that there were no vacant houses. The Japanese officer then inspected a house belonging to the Shi family, a theatrical troupe, in the city, and hired workers to repair it for use as a puppet border police station.

<p>(Changshu) At the Gaopu estuary in Lao Wu Shi, at 4 pm on the 27th, two gray warships passed by and suddenly opened fire with heavy artillery on Laoshusha, and machine guns were fired. The sound was heard for several miles, and the residents were in panic for half an hour before it stopped. Afterwards, Zhao Jinbiao, the squad leader of the police team, recovered three shells in the fields of Nianbu Bridge and Tangyoujiao, one of which had exploded. The shells weighed 13 catties. At 7 pm, artillery fire was heard again, only damaging crops. Fortunately, no major disaster occurred. The authorities are currently investigating the truth. According to residents along the river, the warships seemed to belong to a certain country. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Public Security in Various Counties of Eastern Luan Cannot Be Maintained, Japanese Troops Stationed in Jianchangying and Saheqiao, Japanese Military Police Investigate Various Publications</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Provincial authorities recently received reports from more than 20 counties in eastern Luan, stating that Japanese troops are stationed in varying numbers in each county. Many traitors' shops and civilian houses display Japanese flags, and local officials are unable to negotiate effectively. The drug trafficking organizations established by Japanese and Koreans in each county are harboring bandits, supplying them with firearms and ammunition, and going out to harass at night. Those responsible for public security are all in a difficult situation. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

Chen Baosheng, the county magistrate, and Han Zexin, the captain of the security team, discovered this and dispatched security teams to intercept them at key roads such as Shimen Town, and sent personnel to inquire Wang, questioning the reason for the unauthorized transfer. Wang did not agree to withdraw the various departments that had set off to the original defense of Mashen Bridge. The security team believed that Wang's abnormal movement had an underlying motive and forced all of them to disarm and gather at Mashen Bridge to await orders, and telegraphed the provincial government and the Jilimi Commissioner's Office for instructions on how to deal with it. Wang is under surveillance. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Discusses Public Security Issues in Tianjin, Police Should Pay Attention to Their Own Responsibilities</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) After a robbery case occurred in the French Concession of Tianjin,</p>
<p>The British Concession's Bureau of Public Works issued a notice on the 27th to prevent the possibility of future incidents, stating that pedestrians who want to ask the patrolmen for information at night must not approach closely; otherwise, they will be regarded as bandits and will be responsible for any misunderstandings caused by gunfire. Yu Xuezhong said that the fact that bandits robbed police firearms in the South City shows that our police are too incompetent. The police's responsibility is to protect the people. Now that the people cannot be protected and they themselves are harmed first, isn't that too useless? In the future, there will be no new plans for public security, only that the police pay attention to their own responsibilities and change from useless to useful. Regardless of foreigners or Chinese, if they are detrimental to us, of course we cannot allow them to act arbitrarily. (Special dispatch, 27th) (Tianjin) Liu Kuaiqing, the patrolman who was shot dead by bandits in Fugui Village, South City, on the morning of the 25th, finally died in Madafu Hospital on the 27th due to his serious injuries.

The two sides then became enemies because of this, and took the opportunity to retaliate on the 25th. The South City robbery was directed at the new director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, Li Junxiang, with the intention of causing panic in our area, making it impossible for anyone to maintain it.

<h3>Song Ziwen Reports on Four Construction Plans for the Northwest, Speech at the Welcome Conference of All Circles in Xi'an</h3>
<p>Small profits - Transportation - Agriculture - Improvement - Sanitation (Xi'an) All circles in Xi'an held a welcome conference for Song, a member of the Standing Committee of the Economic Commission, at Minle Garden at 10 am on the 26th, with over 10,000 people attending, which was extremely enthusiastic. Yang Hucheng, the chairman, gave a welcoming speech, and Song, Tie Ci, Qian Zongze, Cheng Zhongxing, and Jiao Yitang also gave speeches. Shao Lizi gave a reply at the end. The original text of Song's speech is as follows: I am very grateful and unspeakably pleased for the grand welcome from all circles today. This time, I, Ziwen, represent the National Economic Commission to conduct an on-the-spot inspection of the Northwest. Yesterday, when I arrived at Tongguan, all the way from Tongguan to Xi'an, what I saw along the way and what I felt when I arrived in Xi'an yesterday, I felt that Shaanxi, the gateway to the Northwest, is definitely not the Shaanxi that outsiders imagine. The people of Shaanxi are already full of vigor and a scene of revival. This phenomenon is really very pleasant to me personally. I only arrived in Xi'an yesterday and have not yet formally exchanged opinions with all circles, but from the slogans everywhere, I can already understand the hope of the people of Shaanxi for the central government, which is to build for them and relieve their suffering. This kind of demand is the psychological foundation for the construction of the Northwest. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the Northwest has suffered from floods, droughts, wars, epidemics, earthquakes, and political darkness. The Northwest is really suffering. Therefore, we think of a sentence from a Westerner who traveled to the Northwest a few years ago: "The Northwest is a place forgotten by God." This means that God has forgotten this place, so the Northwest has undergone so many hardships, and the people's cry of pain has not been heard by anyone. But recently it is not the same. People from the central government have come to the Northwest one after another, and social leaders have also come to the Northwest one after another. "Going to the Northwest" has become a kind of "national policy." According to our observation, the current Shaanxi authorities have already done a lot of basic work regarding the revival of Shaanxi. Director Yang has maintained public security for several years, and social stability has greatly improved. Public security is the prerequisite for construction. With good public security, planned construction can be carried out. Recently, major domestic banks, such as Shanghai China Communications Jin Cheng, have invested here one after another. This is because the national financial community has a considerable understanding of the Northwest, which is also the effect of Director Yang's efforts to maintain public security. Chairman Shao is an old comrade of our party with history. After arriving in the Northwest, he has clarified politics and worked hard to govern. The people of Shaanxi certainly know more clearly than we do about the tangible and intangible contributions to the local areas of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. With such two wise and understanding officials in Shaanxi, the Economic Commission can start to do some beneficial things for the people in the Northwest. The mission of the Economic Commission is to carry out economic construction for the whole country. Its object is the whole, and all provinces in the country should be treated equally. However, knowing that the people in the Northwest are trapped in special suffering, special attention is paid to the Northwest Economic Commission. Because the scope of construction is too large, and the financial and human resources are limited, we can only handle a few things that are most needed by the local area and can be done with the current strength. These things were approved by the General Assembly of the Economic Commission this year and entrusted to Director Liu of the Northwest Office to implement. (1) Water conservancy. Shaanxi is the birthplace of Chinese culture. Now all things are backward. Political unrest is certainly the biggest reason. The failure to repair water conservancy, which is related to the economic lifeline, is also the root cause of the disease. Since the Qin and Han Dynasties, Guanzhong has had good water management systems in all dynasties, so Guanzhong has become a fertile land and a rich area. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty and until the Republic of China, all parties have had difficulties and have no time to take care of it. Therefore, the success or failure of the year depends on fate. Too much rain will cause floods, and too little rain will cause droughts. It is very similar to Egypt in Africa. Egypt was established very early. In the beginning, it handled water conservancy well, so its culture was very prosperous for a time. Later, water administration was abandoned, and the fertile land almost became stone fields, and it declined. Recently, the United Kingdom has repaired water conservancy for it, and it has gradually recovered. The foundation of wealth and prosperity. We fundamentally want to have a way to manage the water conservancy in Shaanxi, and it is not difficult for Guanzhong to restore its former prosperity. The most needed and first thing to do at present is to assist in the completion of the Jinghui Canal and the Luohui Canal. The Jinghui Canal has achieved very good results a few years ago with the urging and support of Director Yang. The Luohui Canal has also begun. The Economic Commission plans to provide technical and economic assistance. With the help of the Economic Commission, the success of these two canals will certainly be extra rapid and satisfactory. In the future, the people of the Northwest will definitely benefit greatly, and the natural disasters of water and drought in the Northwest will definitely be reduced due to the completion of the two canals. In addition, there is a larger plan, which is the Wei River Diversion Plan, which requires a huge amount of 80 million yuan. If it can be done, the entire province will never have to worry about floods and droughts. The Economic Commission is currently engaged in technical research and economic planning, hoping that the country will soon have this power to do it. (2) Transportation. Now the Longhai Railway will soon be open to Xi'an, and the external transportation of Shaanxi Province has been solved in part. However, to seek the prosperity of the Northwest and the economic and national defense links with the whole country, the railway should be extended westward to Lanzhou and southward to Sichuan at a minimum. At present, the central government's financial resources are limited, and we can only start with the construction of highways to remedy this. Now the dirt road from Xi'an to Lanzhou cannot be traveled when it rains. If the rain is a little heavier, the bridges will collapse. It is estimated that there are few times in a year when it can be traveled, and the journey is very long and extremely inconvenient. Now we temporarily do not expect the sophistication of transportation in Europe and the United States, but at least we must ensure that we can travel by car every day and transport every day. This level can definitely contribute to the people of the Northwest in terms of transportation. The Economic Commission has a plan for roads in the Northwest, but it is dissatisfied with the lack of funds. Director Yang is very willing to build roads with the military industry. The army is originally a consumer, but now it has become a profit-making one. The cooperation between the military and the Economic Commission will enable us to achieve a certain goal even if the funds are insufficient. This can be celebrated for the future of the Northwest. (3) Agricultural improvement. The Economic Commission has always paid attention to agriculture and animal husbandry in the Northwest because it is the foundation of the country. Therefore, rural construction, rural cooperation, etc. are all under continuous research. As for cotton, because it is a special product of the Northwest, it is the focus of research. Therefore, last year, the Economic Commission established the Cotton Industry Control Committee and specially appointed Mr. Chen Guangfu as the director of the committee. On the one hand, it improves factory technology, and on the other hand, it develops cotton production. It also goes to the United States to purchase cotton seeds and distributes them to various provinces for planting. Since Shaanxi is a cotton-producing area, it will naturally benefit from this. Although animal husbandry has no important relationship in Shaanxi, it has a very important relationship to the economy of other provinces in the Northwest. What is planned now is to improve the breed of animals on the one hand, and to establish veterinary services on the other hand. According to statistics, the value of cattle and sheep that die from diseases and epidemics in the Northwest every year is no less than tens of millions of yuan. After the thorough implementation of the aforementioned two improvement methods, it will be able to increase the production of tens of millions of yuan for the people of the Northwest every year. (4) Sanitation. The Northwest has no sanitation facilities. I have seen that in European and American countries, they spend tens of millions or hundreds of millions of national currency every year to equip sanitation. It is true that if the people's lives and physiques cannot be healthy, even if there is good construction, it will be useless. China is poor, so of course it cannot follow in the footsteps of Europe and the United States, but even if it is poor, there are ways to be poor. The sanitation equipment in various provinces of China,</p>
<p>is extremely poor, but the provinces still have some scale, but the Northwest does not even have a scale. The Economic Commission believes that this is extremely important and hopes to assist the provinces in actively carrying out various sanitation construction undertakings, especially for the Northwest, hoping to make a foundation for sanitation equipment for it. The above four items are what we want to start with first. I only arrived yesterday and have not had the opportunity to discuss with all circles. In the future, I would like all circles to give guidance at any time and hope to correct their mistakes. The mission of the Economic Commission has been mentioned earlier. Because of the special situation in the Northwest, special attention is paid to it, but we are only limited by financial resources and are not allowed to talk empty words. I especially do not like empty talk. I just want to do it practically with all my heart, but it also requires the cooperation of all circles with the military and political aspects to achieve rapid and excellent results, and then move forward to large-scale construction. And I also hope that all circles in the country will come to the Northwest to engage in business. I have talked with the leaders of various banking circles in detail and deeply know that the various banks do not have the intention of seeking great profits when they come to the Northwest to invest. They do have the consciousness of serving the society. I also believe that when foreign provinces invest in the Northwest, they should pay attention to two key points and abide by them without change: (1) The province should protect foreign capital; (2) Investors should not</p>
<p>have any intention of monopoly. Now the central government, all circles in the country, and I, everyone, concentrate our strength and merge into one to build the Northwest. The construction of the Northwest will definitely succeed. The light of the Northwest is just around the corner. The Northwest is already bright. What I want to thank all circles today is to wish the eternal light of the revival of the Northwest. The original text of Cheng Zhongxing's speech is as follows: Committee Member Song and Deputy Minister Qian have already fully explained the significance of building the Northwest. I would like to say a few words on the cultural significance. Culture is the sum of all the forces of a nation to strive for survival. To observe the rise and fall of a nation, one cannot but focus on culture. Since the September 18th Incident, China has lost the four northeastern provinces in terms of material and has suffered a great blow in terms of spirit. The lessons of the national disaster in the past two years have made the Chinese</p>
<p>The national revival movement is more vigorous than before. Everyone should know what the core of nationalism is, that is, to make everyone recognize the greatness of their own nation in the past, and thus arouse their courage to move forward. Before the unification of Italy, the people of Italy knew to recall Rome. The recent hundred years of independence movement in Turkey was also to arouse the Turks' feelings about Constantine's past heroism. In addition, the British know Shakespeare, and the Germans know Goethe. Therefore, to truly realize nationalism, we must make everyone fully recognize the past, the past regions and figures. From this point of view, the Northwest, especially Shaanxi, is really the birthplace of Chinese national culture. The most prosperous era of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang Dynasties was in Shaanxi. The Duke of Zhou, Qin Shihuang, and Emperor Taizong of Tang all grew up in Shaanxi. Shaanxi is the best practical proof of promoting nationalism. The progress or non-progress of world nations can be judged by their concept of time. Non-progressive nations are nostalgic for the past, perfunctory to the present, and lucky to the future. Progressive nations glorify the past, work hard for the present, and create for the future. Our national movement today is not only about recognizing the past, but also about glorifying the past. Since the past of Shaanxi is so great, the basis and foundation for future creation are also solid. Building the Northwest is connected with the revival of the Chinese nation. The people of the Northwest and the people of the whole country should recognize the past of the Northwest and glorify this past, and then they can create the future of the nation. Shaanxi is full of light, and the Chinese nation is also full of light. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>New Life Movement, Jiang Orders Implementation in All Provinces</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Jiang recently telegraphed the provincial governments, stating that the New Life Movement is vital to the survival of our nation and people. Its success or failure depends entirely on whether the local governments, police, and military officers and soldiers can implement it and understand its significance. Only then can our government officials and soldiers supervise society and influence the people, leading to success. The most important aspect is to implement guidance and supervision in all ship docks and public places, such as theaters, taverns, teahouses, parks, and our government offices and agencies, with particular attention to maintaining order. For example, when purchasing train tickets, theater tickets, and boarding or disembarking at stations and docks, the police must first supervise the scene, advising passengers to queue and advance in order, without jostling or pushing. Secondly, in public places, roads, and alleys, spitting, urinating, loud noises, and shouting should be prohibited. These acts of maintaining order and emphasizing public morality are fundamental to cultivating propriety, righteousness, integrity, a sense of shame, discipline, and collective virtue. It is hoped that this message will be conveyed to subordinates, implemented first in government agencies, and personally supervised by responsible officers. Daily and weekly inspections and reviews must be conducted to avoid a superficial or short-lived effort. It is hoped that you will diligently carry out these measures.

<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Reorganize Ranks, Reform Official System, Major Personnel Changes to Cope with the 1936 Crisis</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, Army Minister Hayashi resolved to demote or remove the anti-incumbent faction within the Army Ministry around August of this year to consolidate the ministry and promote its internal and external policies. The Navy, also mindful of the international crisis in 1935 and 1936 and sharing similar goals with the Army Ministry, plans to reorganize its ministry. The first round of reorganization has been decided and the names of those being demoted or dismissed will be announced on May 10. (Twenty-seventh Dispatch from the China United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) To prepare for the crisis in 1935 and 1936, the Navy has decided to revise the central ministry official system and strengthen its ranks. The positions of Director of the Naval Technical Department and Director of the Naval Air Department, traditionally held by vice admirals, can now be filled by admirals. It has also been decided that Admiral Nakamura Ryuzo, commander of the Kure Naval District, will be transferred to the position of Military Councilor and concurrently serve as Director of the Naval Technical Department. The order will be issued in October. The reason for this revision is that the responsibilities of the Naval Technical Department have expanded and the influence of the Air Force under the Naval Air Department has gradually increased. Furthermore, since the Director of the Army's Air Department can be a general or lieutenant general, it is necessary to maintain a balance. Vice Admiral Fujita Hisanori, the current vice minister, will be transferred to the position of commander of the Kure Naval District, and Vice Admiral Hasegawa Kiyoshi, from the Naval General Staff, will succeed him as vice minister. Rear Admiral Hibino Masaji, chairman of the Military Education Department, will be appointed to the Naval Ministry concurrently serving in the Naval General Staff. He will be succeeded as chairman by Rear Admiral Sakano Tsuneyoshi, from the Naval General Staff. (Twenty-seventh Dispatch from the Telegraphic Communication Society)</p>

<h3>Russian Telegram Reports Japan Using White Russians to Provoke, Planning Anti-Soviet Propaganda on May Day, Attacking Cultural Organizations in the East Road</h3>
<p>News from Boli (Khabarovsk) and Harbin states that White Russian organizations are being aided by Japanese police in preparing for criminal provocations on May 1st. These White Russians have already produced May Day leaflets with the Soviet national emblem, calling on the people to engage in anti-Japanese demonstrations. In order to conceal their true intentions, divert police attention, and implicate the local published newspaper, the "Oriental News," (which usually reveals some neutral news about the Soviet Union), they plan to use the same paper, logo, and style as the "Oriental News" to print the aforementioned leaflets. They plan to distribute these "documents" fabricated by the police on the eve of May Day as a basis for renewed attacks on cultural organizations along the Chinese Eastern Railway. This conspiracy between the White Russians and the Japanese police is a repetition of the provocations and fabrications that have been repeatedly carried out every year during the May Day commemorations for several years.

<p>Prague: French Foreign Minister Barthou arrived in Prague this morning from Poland and was received by President Masaryk, who hosted a banquet in his honor. Leading figures of the Czech government were invited to attend. In the evening, Foreign Minister Beneš hosted a banquet for Barthou. After the banquet, Beneš delivered a speech, stating that French Foreign Minister's official visit to the Czech Republic marks a new beginning, and he welcomed it wholeheartedly. When the Czech Republic was established, the European War had not yet ended, and its first government was organized in France. Therefore, the Czech Republic and France share deep and lasting feelings. France has never exercised hegemony over the Czech Republic, so the Czech Republic does not feel subservient. The two countries have always cooperated in the League of Nations, and their relationship is unshakable. They are determined to protect freedom, rights, and their own safety with the greatest determination. The friendship and alliance between the two countries have a constructive nature. Recently, the authorities of the two countries exchanged views, and their opinions on Central Europe and all international issues have coincided, which is gratifying. He spoke today on behalf of the countries of the Little Entente, just as Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu or representatives of the Yugoslavian government sometimes speak on their behalf. Beneš concluded by saying that he has great hope for the future and is willing to work together for peace to restore the general prosperity of Europe. [France is not only a friendly country and ally to us, but also our good model], etc. Barthou replied that he was very pleased to receive such sincere hospitality, which shows the strength of the friendship between the Czech Republic and France. Barthou continued by saying that the Czech nation has many excellent qualities. With its intelligence, perseverance, and hard-working nature, it was able to create the outline of a nation's existence in just a few years. Its politicians are also making tireless efforts to create peace. President Masaryk and Foreign Minister Beneš, both of whom are advanced in years, have long enjoyed a reputation worthy of the title of international statesmen. Barthou further stated that France and the Czech Republic share the same ideals, and the friendship between the two nations is sincere and without any barriers. Any hegemonic thinking is opposed. They only recognize justice and reason, and they do not recognize the existence of any other power. The peoples of both countries wish all nations to live in harmony and peace and have always trusted the League of Nations as one of the best tools of civilization. Barthou concluded by praising the actions of the countries of the Little Entente, saying that their sole goal is to consolidate peace, while also taking into account the security of neighboring friendly countries.

<h3>Economy in Panic, Germany Unable to Repay Debt, Britain Issues Strong Warning to Germany, Two Ways to Remedy the Situation, Either Increase German Exports or Stop Paying Debts, Creditors Hold Meeting in Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, said in a radio broadcast yesterday that one of the reasons for Germany's current economic panic is the boycott of German goods. Other reasons include the Treaty of Versailles, the devaluation of the dollar and pound sterling, increased tariffs, and import restrictions. Germany's current position is that it is no longer possible to fulfill even a portion of its foreign debt obligations in foreign currency as it did a month ago. The solution lies in increasing German exports, and for creditors to agree to Germany's request regarding interest rates and to extend the debt repayment period. Schacht's speech is very important because Germany's long-term and medium-term creditors are scheduled to hold a meeting in Berlin today to discuss solutions. (Twenty-seventh Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) It is learned that British Ambassador to Germany Sir Eric Phipps delivered a note to the German government, stating that the Dawes and Young loans were initiated by various governments and managed by agreements established by the London Conference of 1924 and the Hague and Paris Conferences of 1930. If Germany proposes to stop remitting payments on these loans, the British government will view it very seriously. According to German newspapers, Germany is expected to completely suspend payments on the Dawes and Young loans, stating that Germany will be forced to notify its creditors that restricting remittances is unavoidable, even for preferred loans. The reason for this is the declining foreign currency reserves of the German National Bank. (Twenty-seventh Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<h3>Liu Yinfuli Discusses Relief for Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Yinfuli, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry, stated that cotton mills are losing about 20 yuan per bale due to the dumping of foreign yarn. The reason for this is outdated equipment. The existing secondary industries are all from 30 years ago, making it difficult to compete with their products. The labor costs are also ten to three times higher than those of Japanese manufacturers. Although Chinese cotton is used, it is also controlled by the Japanese, who buy it in large quantities with cash, while Chinese merchants lack working capital and are unable to compete. The skills of the workers are also far inferior, and the labor system is not as orderly as that of other countries, which has a great impact on the quality of the products. Furthermore, the merchants themselves cannot unite and lack large-scale cooperatives, which hinders the flow of capital and creates obstacles in sales. In addition, banks cannot provide low-interest loans, which are all inevitable trends leading to the current crisis in the cotton industry. Relief efforts will be difficult to initiate without a large sum of money. Reducing cotton taxes is not a fundamental solution. It is hoped that manufacturers can first unite, improve product quality and management, and form large-scale cooperatives to reduce costs and improve sales. The government should then seek comprehensive relief measures at the fundamental level. (Twenty-seventh Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany's Eastward Policy Threatens Peace in Eastern Europe. Soviet Russia's Proposal to Conclude a Convention Rejected by Germany. Baltic Sea Countries Form Alliance to Protect Themselves</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to the German-Russian documents published by the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee, Soviet Russia previously proposed to sign a treaty guaranteeing the independence of the Baltic countries, but it has now been rejected by Germany. The Baltic countries include Finland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. This matter was previously exchanged between Germany and Russia, but now it is hopeless. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Germany's rejection of the proposed Baltic Sea Agreement has increased concerns here. It is widely believed that Germany's plot to invade the Baltic Sea will be the most urgent goal of Germany's current policy, and that westward expansion to develop is secondary. Foreign Minister Litvinov replied to German Ambassador Naduni that Germany's rejection of the Soviet Russian government's proposal was regrettable because the purpose of Soviet Russia's proposal was to consolidate peace in Eastern Europe and with Germany. Litvinov also said that the destruction of peace in Eastern Europe would be the harbinger of a new world war. It is tantamount to ignoring the international crisis to deny that the Baltic countries are under threat, he said. Germany rejected Soviet Russia's proposal on the grounds that the Russian government had proposed the same agreement to the Baltic states last December, and the second agreement was widely seen as aimed at resisting Germany. Since the publication of Germany's reply, Lithuania has proposed to Latvia and Estonia to sign a defense alliance to resist aggression from other countries. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The South Route Army Recaptures Junmenling</h3>
<p>Li Yangjing personally supervised the troops at the front as the remnant bandits fled to Qingxi, Luotian. Guangzhou Correspondence: The 2nd Column of the South Route Bandit Suppression Army, led by Li Yangjing, has recently been actively attacking the bandit stronghold of Junmenling. The 7th and 8th Divisions have successively recaptured strategic locations near Junmenling, such as Chengjiang, Luotang, and Pangu. They immediately surrounded Junmenling and transferred artillery companies from the 7th and 8th Divisions and the artillery battalion directly under the 3rd Army headquarters, concentrating them on high ground to bombard the defensive positions of the bandit army at Junmenling with 7.5-inch heavy artillery. At the same time, the 5th Air Force Squadron stationed in Meixian was ordered to send several aircraft daily to bomb the bandit strongholds with heavy bombs. The 2nd Column headquarters was advanced to Jitan, and Li Yangjing personally went to the front to direct the operation. The 1st Training Regiment of the 3rd Army, led by He Yushu, rushed from Puning to Jitan to await orders. On the 21st of this month, Li Yangjing ordered a general attack on all units at the front. Six aircraft from the 5th Air Force assisted in the battle, and the army and air force destroyed more than 20 bandit strongholds. The bandits under Ye Jianying who were defending the mountain suffered more than 600 casualties. After a day-long stalemate, the Lian Tangsheng Regiment of the 7th Division bravely charged and captured Junmenling in the evening. The remnant bandits fled to the Qingxi area of Luotian. Government troops also suffered more than 500 casualties in this battle. The telegrams sent from the front are recorded as follows: (1) Yang of the Political Training Department of the 3rd Army telegraphed: [On the 21st (of this month), the units under the 2nd Column launched a general attack on Junmenling, fought fiercely for a day, and captured strategic passes in succession. Government troops coordinated the attack and occupied Junmenling at Shen time (3-5 PM), killing, wounding, and capturing many bandits. The air force was exceptionally brave in this operation. Although the weather has been bad in recent days, the air force still risked advancing from Meixian to bomb Junmenling, making four or five round trips every day. After the recapture of Junmenling on this day, one aircraft was lost while flying astray. Commander Li Yangjing was very concerned when he heard the news and immediately telegraphed to various counties to search for its whereabouts. It was not until dusk that Captain Wu reported that he had safely landed at Chao'an Airport, and everyone was relieved.] (Signed by Yang, Political Training Department of the 3rd Army.) (2) Li Yangjing, Commander of the 2nd Column, telegraphed: [After the command post of my column advanced to Pangu'ao Yangjiaoying, it was learned that the main force of the bandits was southwest of Junmenling, where there were several places to ford. It was decided to attack in that direction with the main force, using the strength of seven regiments to attack and advance from Yangjiaoying, Xingcun, and Luobin this morning. The bandits facing us were the bogus 22nd Division and the Independent 5th Regiment, as well as more than 8,000 armed bandits with more than 6,000 guns from Xunwu, Luotang, Chengjiang, Yangjiaoying, Junmenling, and the Soviet area, occupying strong fortifications in the Panshan Wangtou Dongfenghuang Dongdasanggong Wushixia Huangshadong and garrisoned high ground, resisting stubbornly. Our army bravely advanced and fought fiercely all day. Except for a few bandit forts at Panshan Pass and garrisoned high ground that are still under siege and bombardment, the bandits were successively defeated. At 5 PM, the Lian Regiment of the 7th Division first captured Junmenling, and the bandits fled in panic to Qingxi, Luotian. Troops have been dispatched to pursue and suppress them. In this battle, more than 20 bandit bunkers were destroyed, and more than 600 bandits were killed or wounded. More than 500 guns were captured. Our army suffered more than 500 officer and soldier casualties. The prisoners have been escorted to Pingyuan. Respectfully reported.] (April 23rd)</p>

After the price increase, the market turned quiet.</p>

<h3>Wu Qiwai Attacks Ningdu and Captures Yunjizhai and Changshengqiao</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Northern Route Army's columns are advancing towards Ningdu and Guangchang. The divisions led by Fu Zhongfang, who are attacking Guangchang, have passed Ganzhu and are no more than ten li from Guangchang City. The recapture of the county seat is imminent. The troops led by Wu Qiwai, who are advancing on Ningdu from Le'an and Yongfeng, have completed transportation works and established effective communication with the rear after capturing Zhao Xie Shaxi, and are advancing southward. However, before the completion of Wu's works, the bandit side used the bogus 13th Army Corps, Divisions 1, 4, 5, and 6, to attack Wu's positions fiercely. Wu's troops defeated them, and the bogus 1st Army Corps retreated south, and the bogus 3rd Army Corps retreated east. Wu's troops then advanced from Shaxi to Toubei Longgang on the 21st. Unexpectedly, the bogus 23rd Division and various bogus independent regiments of Yongle were building fortifications in the Shanggu area, resisting stubbornly. From Chen time (7-9 AM) to Wu time (11 AM-1 PM), the fighting was fierce. The bogus 42nd Regiment was completely defeated by Wu's troops, who occupied the bandit's Xian Shanfeng fortress and then recaptured strategic locations such as Changshengqiao and Yunjizhai, and captured prisoners. Shanggu is adjacent to Toubei Junbu and Ningdu's Xiaopudong Shao Lukou side by side. If Longgang Toubei is captured, it will be like Guangchang losing Ganzhu, and the recapture of Ningdu will not be a problem. (April 24th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Inspects Upper Reaches of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Strict order for Rizhao regimental commander to pay attention to Liu bandits. Jailer of Dong'a county fired for dereliction of duty. Jinan Correspondence: Provincial government chairman Han Fuqu, now that the remnant troops of Liu Guitang have been resolved and the bandit suppression military affairs have ended, decided to go on tour to the counties in northern Shandong. First, he went to the upper reaches of the Yellow River, Dongping, Dong'a, Shou Zhang, and other counties to inspect the upper reaches of the Yellow River. This morning (26th), he set off at 7 AM. Accompanying him were provincial government advisors Han Duofeng, Ge Jinzhang, Guo Zhigang, Zhang Liansheng, and adjutant director Meng Guangshan, as well as a platoon of guards to protect him. The planned route was along the motor road on the south bank of the Yellow River, first to Changqing, then through Pingyin, Dong'a, and Dongping to Fan County and Pu County, and then to inspect the breach at Shitou Zhuang last year, and to inspect the experimental county area near Heze. He would return to Jinan in about three or four days and then go to the counties in northern Shandong for inspection. During Han's tour, government affairs were handled by Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun and Provincial Government Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, while military affairs were the responsibility of Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division, and Liu Shuxiang, chief of staff of the headquarters.</p>
<p>According to the long-distance telephone message from the east at 8:30 tonight, Han and his party arrived in Changqing at 8:15 AM in the morning. County magistrate Li Qiyuan and Public Security Bureau Director Huang Jiefu and others welcomed him outside Dongguan. Han got out of the car and briefly asked the county magistrate and others a few words, got in the car and passed through the city, and arrived at Wangshankou at 10 o'clock. This place is close to the Yellow River and has a stone yard set up by the River Affairs Bureau. Han got out of the car to rest and was received by Zhou Shangwen, director of the yard. Han, thinking of the Rizhao area of eastern Shandong, feared that there might be scattered bandits of Liu Guitang, so he telegraphed from Wangshankou to Rizhao, ordering county magistrate Yang Jinbiao to inform Regimental Commander Wu Yuanxing to strictly deal with the scattered bandits of Liu. If there is any negligence, only the regimental commander will be held responsible. At 10:30 AM, he went west again, passing through Pingyin County without stopping. At 2 PM, he arrived in Dong'a, also without stopping. Unexpectedly, the route was complicated, and he arrived at Weigou, eight li from Dong'a County, and found that the route was wrong. He got out of the car to rest and summoned the local people to talk, inquiring in detail about the hardships of the people and the water situation last year. Later, he turned back to Dong'a, and by the time he arrived at the county government, it was already 3 PM. After getting out of the car, he first went to the prison and gathered the prisoners to speak, about thirty prisoners. Han also asked each prisoner if there were any grievances, and whether the guards had extorted or abused them. There was a detainee named Zhao Yujing who stated the reasons for his crime to Han, roughly saying, "There are three sons in total. Because the eldest and second sons beat the third son to death, the eldest and second sons both escaped. Now I am confessing my crime on behalf of my son. The original sentence was four years of imprisonment. I have already served three years. I was tortured by the jailer Gong Zhaocai with 'sitting on a stove' and wearing 'big fetters,' and extorted sixty yuan in silver dollars, etc." Han was furious when he heard this and beat the jailer Gong Zhaocai a hundred times with a stick and immediately dismissed him. Han also took out sixty yuan to Zhao Yujing to compensate him for his losses. He then went to the county government to rest and had dinner. At this time, County Magistrate Zhuang Shouchong had just returned from inspecting the Yellow River project. Han instructed County Magistrate Zhuang Shouchong, saying that there were too many detainees and they had not been resolved for a long time, so he should quickly conclude the investigation, and interrogated forty or fifty unresolved cases, and still instructed the county magistrate to quickly conclude the investigation. At 4 PM, he left Dong'a for Dongping and arrived at 7 PM. County magistrate Zhang Zhixi, Public Security Bureau Director Li Yaorong, and other government officials welcomed him on both the north and south banks of the Daqing River. Han, seeing that it was late, did not have time to inspect and decided to stay overnight in the county at a Yuan family's home. Tomorrow (27th) morning at 6 AM, he will gather civil servants, the militia brigade, and public security bureau personnel to give a speech, and then go to Shitou Zhuang to inspect the Yellow River project.

<h3>Anhui Province Highway Construction. Scheduled Intermodal Transport on the Nanjing-Shanghai and Nanjing-Wuhu Routes</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The construction of highways and municipalities in Anhui Province has progressed rapidly in the past year or two. For example, the Wuhu-Tunxi highway, which starts in Wuhu, was cut off after the Jiangnan Railway Company built the Wuhu-Zha Railway, and the roadbed from Yanhu to Xuanzhi was cut off. The merchants and residents of Wuhu and Tunxi found it inconvenient to transfer in the middle because they could not reach the connection directly. After...</p>
<h3>"Seals" Discovered in Linzi. Like Current Sealing Wax. Used to Seal Bamboo Slips</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Linzi County, eastern Shandong, was the capital of the Qi Kingdom in the Zhou Dynasty. Until the Former Han Dynasty, it was mostly the fief of royal nobles. It has a long history and brilliant literature. Many ancient sites and artifacts. Recently, "seals" were discovered in the ancient city area of Liujiazhai and Jianzhai, more than two miles north of Linzi City. This object appeared in the past, but unfortunately, many people did not know its name and use, and most of them regarded it as waste and allowed it to be destroyed. Later, this ancient object also appeared in Sichuan and Shaanxi. At that time, everyone guessed that it was an ancient "mold" used to cast seals. Later, someone, based on the Book of Han, knew that it was a seal. Before Cai Lun in the Han Dynasty, China had no paper. All books and records used bamboo slips or silk. Sometimes, because there were too many words, they could not be fully recorded on one or two bamboo slips, so they were connected with ropes. The joints of the rope heads were sealed with mud. The seal of an individual or the government or a letter was also made for the bamboo slips. After the other party received it, the seal was removed and filed. It is similar to the use of sealing wax on envelopes now, but the intention is slightly different between ancient and modern times. According to this, it can be seen that ancient cultural relations were quite significant. During the late Qing Dynasty, a large number of these seals appeared in Linzi and were collected by Chen, a local collector, while the rest were bought by Wu Zibi of Haifeng (now renamed Wudi County). Chen and Wu were related as father-in-law and son-in-law. Later, the two men jointly studied and published a book "A Brief Study of Seals." After the death of the two men, Chen's collection was sold to the Japanese, and Wu's collection was also sold by his descendants. The number of Linzi seals that continue to be unearthed is also very large, and most of them have been purchased by collectors outside the province, such as Luo Zhenyu and Zhou Jimu. Wang Xiantang, director of the Shandong Provincial Library, also has some collections.</p>
<p>Further requests. At the same time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said that direct transit was appropriate, so he telegraphed the provincial government to change the route and still take Wuhu as the starting point, lay a new roadbed, and build it to Wanzhi. Jin Youqiao, a special commissioner for the inspection of Wuhu-Tunxi Road, who was the third district administrative commissioner and the director of the construction department, planned to gather workers and started construction in sections a few days ago. The Wuhu section is connected to the Nanjing-Wuhu Highway, and the Huangshan Tangkou remediation costs are huge. We have requested the rapid allocation of subsidies to avoid delays.</p>
<p>The surveying engineering for the Nanjing-Zhaotong Railway and Nanjing-Wuhu section of the railway planned by the Jiangnan Railway Company has passed the Caishi Town and will reach Wuhu by the end of this month. The Guxi River in Dangtu will build an iron bridge, designed by engineer Xia. The river is forty feet deep, and the foundation work will be tested soon. The bridge deck will be a cantilever steel plate, and construction is planned to begin in June.</p>
<p>The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, after the completion of the Nanjing-Wuhu highway and the connection with upstream riverboats, can reduce travel time. For the convenience of travelers, it has prepared intermodal transport. Recently, it has signed a contract with the Wuhu West Section Long-Distance Bus Company, which will be implemented on May 1. Passengers can purchase joint tickets at Shanghai North Station, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Jiangningzhen, Caishi, Dangtu, and Wuhu stations.</p>
<p>In addition to rice and grain, rapeseed is the largest export of Anhui Province. After the rice donation was stopped, rapeseed was exported from Wuhu. Because there was a suspicion of secretly selling it to the Japanese, donations were collected to show prohibition in the levy. Recently, Lou Daoxin, director of the Wuhu Works Bureau, requested the provincial government to continue the rapeseed donation specifically for the construction of the Wuhu Ring Road, Zhongshan Park, and the widening of Erjie Road because of the huge amount of money needed. The provincial government meeting has passed it and telegraphed to plan and proceed with the projects as soon as possible. (26th)</p>
<h3>Chiang's General Order to Provinces: People Must Perform Labor Service</h3>
<p>Implementation measures to be determined according to the needs of each province, starting with Baojia, teams, and public education propaganda.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang recently issued a general order to the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, stating: "In examining the future of our country's revival, striving for construction and cultivating national strength are of utmost urgency. Construction in all aspects relies on our entire citizenry, each according to their ability, each fulfilling their duty, and working together to accelerate efficiency and complete tasks. Article 26 of Chapter 2 of the Provisional Constitution during the Tutelage Period already stipulates that people have the obligation to perform labor service according to law. Starting this year, people in each province who have reached adulthood must perform a minimum of three days of labor service annually. The implementation measures and labor needs shall be formulated properly by each provincial government based on local conditions and social customs, and earnestly followed, with the paramount consideration being not to hinder agricultural activities. Before implementation, widespread publicity must be undertaken, especially focusing on such publicity when handling Baojia, training teams, and expanding public education, so that the people will all know that this type of labor service is a national obligation that should be fulfilled, so that its implementation will be smooth and the whole country will gladly follow, using the spirit of labor and unity to correct the long-standing habits of laziness and disunity. The Chairman has high expectations. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance and for submittal to subordinates for compliance, and the handling situation should be reported for record. This order."

<h3>Songjiang: Opposition to River Dredging Intensifies</h3>
<p>Regarding the dredging of the city river in Songjiang, the budget has been increased to more than double the original plan, and the hiring of outside laborers has disturbed the local area. The gentry and common people have repeatedly opposed it, but the county government has turned a deaf ear. Yesterday, citizens of Songjiang, Yao Songxian and Lei Junyan, sent a telegram urging the provincial authorities to dismiss County Magistrate Jin and Technician Xu to appease the people of Songjiang. Today, Chen Xiliang and others have completely exposed the malpractices involved and have also filed a complaint with the province. The original text is recorded below: "To Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government: Respectfully reporting, the dredging of the city river in Songjiang has the same route and the same dimensions, but the cost has suddenly increased by two-thirds compared to the tenth and fourteenth years of the Republic. The gentry and elders have repeatedly appealed, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Who would believe there are no malpractices involved? Recently, farmers and workers have gone bankrupt, and the number of unemployed has increased several times. Those who care about the people's suffering, at this time, if there is work available, it must be work-for-relief, so that both sides are taken care of and funds are not wasted in vain. Instead, outside workers are used, seizing the rights of the local people. This is scheme one. In past river dredging projects, the calculation of earthwork included difficult and distant work, totaling more than five jiao. Now, the earthwork is only opened at four jiao, so that when local workers see it, they will consider the wages too low and all refrain from participating. This is scheme two. In the past, the bid deposit was only a modest sum, never as high as two thousand yuan. We ask, how can poor workers have this borrowing ability? It is clearly intended to reject local workers. This is scheme three. The reason why they use all means to prevent local people from participating is that local workers are familiar with the situation and cannot avoid exposing their conspiracies. In this budget, on the pretext of difficult and distant work, each cubic meter of earthwork costs as much as one yuan and two jiao, which is truly shocking. The person in charge of the Taichang Gravel Company is a local official from another district. Since it is a gravel company, why is it overstepping its bounds to contract river work? If it is contracting river work, are there any precedents elsewhere? Are there any achievements? If there are achievements, why not state its name properly and still call it a gravel company? Recently, prices of goods and rice have fallen, and wages are also cheap. According to previous river dredging cases, about 20,000 yuan was already a generous sum. However, at a time when people's livelihoods are declining and beyond repair, the budget has suddenly increased by more than 40,000 yuan. This situation is truly worth pondering. Although the people of Songjiang are foolish, they are unwilling to be exploited and cannot help but appeal to you, urgently requesting that you instruct the Songjiang County to immediately reduce the budget to match the old plan, and dismiss the supposed gravel company and instead use local people. The people of Songjiang would be most fortunate. We cannot express our urgent desire to await your orders, Chen Xiliang, Zhu Mingxin, Sun Jingheng, Cheng Lihuan, Yao Bolian, Zhang Weizhi, Liu Meiqian, Wang Tiezheng, Zhang Shiliang."</p>
<h3>Grieving Over Child's Death, Angered at Doctor</h3>
<p>Cheng Jixin, residing at Yushu Tou, Changqiao South Street, because the infant child he produced was ill, once hired pediatrician Qian Qingshi for diagnosis and treatment, opened a prescription at the pharmacy, purchased medicine, decocted, and administered, but ultimately could not be saved and died prematurely the other day. Cheng Jixin was deeply grieved, believing that Dr. Qian's prescription did not match the symptoms, leading to this disaster. Filled with resentment, he pretended to seek a follow-up consultation the next day, continuing to hire Dr. Qian to come to his home. Dr. Qian immediately went by sedan chair, and upon entering the door, was immediately met by Cheng's family, launching a great accusation, followed by twisting, fighting, tearing clothes, and hitting the sedan chair, venting the grief of bereavement. Fortunately, Dr. Qian struggled and escaped danger. It is heard that after Qian returned home, he immediately hired a lawyer to write a complaint. It is recently learned that the Procuratorate has approved the petition and scheduled a summons for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: County Government Convenes Talks to Address the Rickshaw Pullers' Strike</h3>
<p>The Suzhou rickshaw pullers, dissatisfied with the authorities' ban on empty rickshaws traveling through the bustling city, went on a full strike on the morning of the 26th, causing an uproar that included assaults on police and the flying squad firing guns and injuring two rickshaw pullers. As of yesterday morning (the 27th), some rickshaws at Lou Qi, Panmen, and other places had resumed work, but were unable to reach the city center due to obstruction by striking rickshaw pullers. Around Lümen, because some small contractors believed that those arrested had not yet been released, they refused to release the rickshaws. Near the small vegetable market, two rickshaws that had been dragged there from other places were smashed. At the time, the horse-drawn carriages outside the city were also drawn into the vortex. They resumed work at 8 a.m. yesterday, but were once stopped at the intersection of Liuyuan Road and Huqiu Road around 10 a.m. After Police Chief Shen Gaozhen went there to lecture them, which lasted for an hour, the striking crowd dispersed. Yesterday morning, Guānqián Street was still guarded by military police. Around 9 a.m., two or three hundred rickshaw pullers gathered again and destroyed self-provided chartered rickshaws along the way. The flying squad then arrested Pan Zhulu and Liang Dejiang, two managers. The number of rickshaw pullers who had been arrested for causing trouble has reached thirty, all of whom are detained at the Public Security Bureau. The failure to resolve the resumption of work as scheduled yesterday hinged on the issue of empty rickshaws passing through the streets. On the surface, the point of contention between the two sides was that the officials ordered that work be resumed before releasing people, while the rickshaw pullers demanded that those detained be released before resuming work. The county government convened a temporary party-government talk meeting at around 11 a.m. to discuss handling measures. The results were: (1) The county government will issue a notice to inform all rickshaw pullers of the reasons why empty rickshaws cannot pass through the busy streets. (2) At the same time, the county government will issue another notice to persuade them to resume work, and in the future, no more incidents of fighting and disturbances may occur, and violators will be arrested and severely punished without leniency. (3) The rickshaw pullers arrested on the 26th will be allowed to be released on bail, and it was also decided that if there are other backgrounds in the obstruction of rickshaw pullers who have agreed to resume work, in addition to the Public Security Bureau being responsible for prevention, those who incite labor unrest will also be investigated and severely punished. Currently, the county party department is in the process of contacting representatives of the rickshaw pullers to resume work on the one hand and release people on the other.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Wu Zhihui Inspects the Desheng Bridge Project</h3>

Afterwards, he inspected the revetment in front of Daonan School, which also needed to be repaired. He immediately took out 300 yuan for labor and materials and handed it over to his nephew Zongjie for handling. After finishing, he took a car to Wuxi and took the Beijing-Shanghai special express train to Shanghai at 8:55 p.m.</p>
<h3>Baita: Further News of Trouble Caused by Temple Fair, Changzhou</h3>
<p>A temple fair was held in Baita Temple in the third district of Wuyi to welcome the gods. The district chief of the district, Chen Yi, together with the police team and the secretary of the Public Security Sub-station, Fang Yongqi, led the police to stop it. As a result, District Chief Chen and Secretary Fang were beaten and injured and then taken away, their whereabouts unknown. It was reported in yesterday's newspaper.

Subsequently, Xu Baoguang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally dispatched a shell team of thirty soldiers to rescue District Chief Chen and arrest the murderer and punish him. When the military and police arrived in the countryside, they learned that Wu Pingzhai, the inspector of the Public Security Sub-station, had hired two boats to search in the river. Chen, the district chief, and Fang, the secretary, were found in a small boat in the Caodang Bend. However, District Chief Chen was covered in wounds. It was said that he was tied up in Baita Temple, and someone wanted to burn him to death. Fortunately, he was rescued and hid in a small boat to escape danger, etc. Inspector Wu and others then carried the injured District Chief Chen and Secretary Fang to the city on the morning of the 26th for treatment. District chiefs from various districts and various organizations have sent telegrams to the county government to severely punish the criminals. District Chief Chen is recuperating at the Autonomous Research Association. Yang Kongxi, the chief prosecutor of the county court, personally went to examine the injuries. County Magistrate Cai also went to express his condolences. However, at that time, self-defense pistols and box guns were still missing, which still needs to be investigated strictly. As for the chief culprits who caused the trouble, they are being hunted down.</p>

<h3>News of the Collapse of the Wentian Dyke Stone Embankment</h3>
<p>The stone embankments of the Wenjia Dyke in the Xiao-Shao section of Zhejiang Province, such as the Bai, Ju, Shi, and Chang, are located at the confluence of the Fuchun and Puyang Rivers, opposite the Dongjiang Estuary. The river surface is only 700 meters wide, the narrowest point of the Qiantang River. The transverse current rushes, and the river bottom is scoured to a depth of more than 30 meters. There was a danger once in the 18th year of the Republic of China, but fortunately, the rescue was effective and it was not breached. On the 23rd of this month, the water level there suddenly dropped to 4.20 meters, breaking the record of the lowest water level of 4.40 meters on July 29, 21st year of the Republic of China. At the same time, the Tan water collapsed to a depth of 2 meters, and the soil attached to the embankment body began to crack. Fortunately, the rescue was effective and no disaster has yet occurred. On the 24th, the Water Conservancy Bureau reported that except for the slightly moving part of Juxing, the rest had been properly settled. On the 20th, a follow-up report stated that the river water had risen by half a meter, and the embankment body could be temporarily safe. Currently, more stones are being thrown to ensure safety. To prevent any eventuality, the Water Conservancy Bureau decided to build an earth reserve dike behind the stone embankment. Measurement has begun, and 500 workers will be recruited immediately to rush to complete the construction within two weeks.</p>
<h3>Murderer Who Buried Corpse Executed by Hanging</h3>
<p>Ge Yongyuan, who opened a small hotel in Maqiao, Haining, once traded dried mulberry leaves with Sun Fuchun for more than sixty yuan in the 17th year of the Republic of China. When the deadline arrived, Sun went to collect the debt. Ge claimed he had no funds to pay and, together with his partner Ma Ali, killed Sun on the way and buried the body in Jijiadi.

We are truly grateful for your public service.</p>

<h3>Zou Bingwen of the Cotton Control Association Traveled North Again Yesterday to Investigate, Xu Zhongdi Stayed in Shaanxi to Guide the Improvement Office</h3>
<p>After the National Economic Committee's Cotton Control Association jointly established the Cotton Production Improvement Office with the Shaanxi Provincial Government, the Cotton Control Association purchased 4,500 dan of American cotton seeds from Zhangde, Henan, and transported them to Shaanxi, and sent Xu Zhongdi and Zou Bingwen to establish the Cotton Production Improvement Office and distribute the cotton seeds. It has now been largely completed. Zou Bingwen returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Xu Zhongdi could not return to Shanghai temporarily because he needed to guide the office there. As Shaanxi is located on a plateau with few rivers, there is flooding after every rainfall, and in sunny weather the water source is cut off and there is no way to irrigate. The office is now dredging the Jinghui Canal and the Zhuanluo Canal to facilitate irrigation. Since construction began, it has been completed in sequence, which is convenient for farmers. The Cotton Control Association, in order to promote the improvement of cotton seeds in various places, specially sent Zou Bingwen to Jinan, Tianjin, and other places yesterday morning to investigate whether the cotton seeds in those places are suitable. If not, they will find ways to change the seeds for planting. He will return to Shanghai in about ten days. Because the Association believes that the consumption of cotton has been very large in recent years, and domestic production is not sufficient, and it is necessary to rely on foreign cotton, the promotion of cotton planting is to reduce the intrusion of foreign cotton into the market.</p>
<h3>Our Nation's Precarious Fishing Industry Future: Japanese Fish Dumping Methods Exhaustive; Organize Fishing Companies to Compete</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Regarding the coastal spring fishing season in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area, the yellow croaker and ribbonfish seasons have passed, and the squid season is approaching. The coastal fishing conditions this season are quite good, and the sea is also very peaceful, with no bandit disturbances. However, the drop in fish prices and the business conditions are not very good. Compared with last year's income, the loss is more than one-tenth. In the coastal areas, there are more than 900 pairs of large fishing boats, each pair consisting of two boats, a male and a female, hence the term "pair." More than 900 pairs means more than 1,800 boats. There is also a type of fishing boat called "ice fresh," which stores a lot of water and transports fresh fish. There are also more than 600 of these ice fresh boats. However, due to the recent drop in market prices and the unusual abundance of Japanese fish in the market, with exhaustive dumping methods, the future of our nation's fishing industry is quite precarious. According to those familiar with the fishing industry, our authorities should immediately organize a fishing company with the fishermen at this time to take charge of the matter, in order to expand operations and compete with foreign merchants.</p>

<h3>Tenants of Pei-Teh Lane Request Restoration of Water Supply: Representative Lawyer Writes to Chinese Ratepayers' Association, Forwarded by Municipal Council to Water Company</h3>
<p>Lawyer Wang Xian-gu, representing the tenants of Pei-Teh Lane on Xinza Road, wrote to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association: "Dear Sirs, we have recently received a petition from all the tenants of Pei-Teh Lane on Xinza Road. The tenants' water fees have been supplied by the landlord, the Catholic Church, for many years. In the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the water fee was increased by one yuan. However, this was not a fee that the tenants should have paid, but they did not argue due to the difficult times. Unexpectedly, the landlord became more and more demanding and planned to increase the water fee by five yuan per household. The tenants immediately refused because it was unreasonable and insatiable. Unexpectedly, the landlord, the Catholic Church, disregarded humanity and, without written notice, instructed the water company to close the water gate at 9 a.m. on the 24th of this month, implementing a water cut, placing more than 3,000 tenants in the lane in mortal danger. Such cruel behavior would not be openly attempted even by the most stubborn and completely business-oriented landlords. Now it is happening from the Catholic Church, which is known for preaching, which was completely unexpected. The tenants inquired with the Xinza Road Police Station because the incident was sudden, and were told that it was due to non-payment of housing taxes. They also went to the water company to inquire, and were told that they were instructed by the landlord because the tenants did not install sub-meters. The answers from both sides were different, which made people more suspicious. According to the patent contract between the Municipal Council and the water company on March 17, 1928, there is a clause that states, translated as, 'In houses where the landlord pays the water fee, if the house is inhabited, the water company shall not, at the request of the landlord, cut off the water supply to all or part of the house, but the landlord shall not be relieved of his responsibility to pay the full water fee.' It is very clear that the landlord and the water</p>
<p>company shall not cut off the water supply. If there was no collusion in advance, why would the Municipal Council repeatedly allow the company to break the contract without paying attention? Before the landlord fairly deducts the water fee from the rent, it is impossible to force the tenants to install sub-meters through pressure. However, water is essential to life and cannot be cut off even for a moment. The situation is urgent. Therefore, we have specially entrusted you to write to the Municipal Council and inform the water company to restore the water supply immediately and to effectively prevent the recurrence of such inhumane behavior in the future, in order to protect people's lives. We would be most grateful if you would investigate and reply. Respectfully submitted to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession."</p>

<h3>Deadline for Payment of Match Consolidated Tax: Ministry of Finance Agrees to Extend by One Month</h3>
<p>Ta Kung Pao reports: The National Match Industry Federation stated that since the Ministry of Finance increased the consolidated tax on matches, various match factories have suffered difficulties in their business due to payment issues. They have repeatedly submitted requests to the Tax Bureau to request the Ministry of Finance to extend the payment date. However, the Ministry of Finance refused to approve, stating that it concerned national taxes and fees and could not be changed. The federation continued to request, and yesterday received a reply agreeing to extend the payment by one month. The original reply is as follows: "Respectfully replying to your letter regarding the extension of the payment date for the consolidated tax on matches, please reply, etc. After reviewing the difficulties mentioned, they are factual. We have submitted a memorandum to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and have received a reply stating, 'The extension can be extended by one month,' etc. We should comply with this and stipulate that it will be calculated from May. It is understood that this method refers to the tax款 recorded from May, which can be extended to June 25 for clearance, and the tax款 for June can be extended to July 25 for clearance, and so on. We hereby clearly state this to avoid misunderstandings. In addition to instructing all subordinate units to take note, we hereby reply for your information. Please forward this letter to the various match factories for their information. To the National Federation of Match Industries."</p>
<h3>National Goods Factories Association Requests Revision of Import Tariff on Raw Material Poplar Wood, and Increase Import Tax on Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, and the National Tariff Commission, stating: "We have secretly learned that members China Reed Factory, Jiujing Reed Factory, Huachang Reed Factory, etc., have stated that the raw materials for matchsticks are white poplar wood and American poplar wood, which are soft in texture and can only be used for manufacturing matchsticks. It is not suitable for building materials, which is clear in the timber industry. If it is left for half a year, the quality will easily deteriorate and the color will turn black, becoming waste material. (Omission) Please your committee for assistance, report to the authorities for prompt approval, increase the heavy tax on Japanese semi-finished products, exempt the import tax on raw materials white poplar wood and American poplar wood, and reduce the export tax rate on nationally produced reed sticks and box pieces to the association. Accordingly, according to the customs import tariff category 12 timber products, heavy wood is subject to a customs duty of two yuan and three jiao per cubic meter. It is found that the raw material poplar wood for matchsticks is of poor quality and easily rotten, and the value is very different from the heavy wood of building materials. It is proposed that this poplar wood be treated in accordance with item 601 (G) wood chips, (Ren) wood sticks, and note that it is used for matchsticks, and levy a very light import tax to maintain the production of national reed wood. This is the first wish to request assistance. The current tariff system takes one object one tax as a principle. The factory tax bills for the yarn industry can offset the export tax on cotton cloth, and the matchstick matter is the same. All reed sticks made by merchant reed factories are semi-finished products. When exporting, it is proposed that the import poplar wood tax bills be allowed to offset the export tax on matchsticks, in order to comply with the principle of one object one tax. This is the second wish to request assistance. Japanese reed wood and raw materials are tax-free when exported in Japan, and they are sold in China. They are subject to a customs import tax, which is circulated throughout the country. Moreover, Japanese goods change the light weight to deceive Chinese merchants, so the same price, Japanese goods are still profitable, and Chinese goods are not enough cost. This is the main reason for the difference of two yuan and one jiao five points per dan. It is proposed to increase the import tax on Japanese wood chips or collect dumping tax to counter it. This is the third wish to request assistance. The association is not unaware that the national treasury is difficult, and the customs tax concerns the budget. When Japanese goods are falling in price and dumping, the Chinese merchants and factories are affected, and at the time of crisis, it is necessary to ask the major departments to consider both and reduce the tax rate on national goods in order to save them. For this reason, we pour out the following information and hope that the major departments will check and review, and think that the Shanghai Chinese reed factory is affected by the Japanese goods falling in price and dumping, and the business has stopped 70%, and the number of workers who lost their jobs is more than 10,000. The import tax rules for raw material poplar wood should be revised quickly, the export tax on semi-finished products should be exempted, and the import tax on Japanese wood chips should be increased, or a dumping tax should be levied so that the dying reed factory can continue to resume work and the unemployed workers can recover their life. It is not only the luck of the industrial future."</p>
<h3>Request for Return of Detained Matches: Reply from the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Area</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Branch of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association of this city, previously reported on the case of Taiyuanchang Tobacco Exchange on Limalu requesting the tax office to prove the detained matches and requesting their return. The branch received the reply from the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Area and the Shanghai Inspection Office yesterday. The letter from the Inspection Office stated: "We have received your letter, stating that Taiyuanchang Tobacco Exchange claimed that in November of the previous year, they批進ed Double Hand Brand matches from Zhongnan Match Company in Suzhou. Due to sluggish sales, there were still ten listening托别号代销s left. While transporting, there were two listening因包皮破碎s, and the seal驗戮 was untraceable, which was why they were detained. We hereby write to certify that it was not a tax evasion, and please return them. This case has been reported to the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Area for instructions on how to handle it, and should be followed by the Bureau's order. If the company believes that it did not evade taxes, it can directly apply to the District Bureau. We hereby reply, and we hope you will check and notify. Sincerely yours." The letter from the Consolidated Tax Bureau stated: "Your letter has been read. The Inspection Office's seizure of two listening Double Hand Brand matches from Taiyuanchang Tobacco Exchange has not been reported to the Bureau by the office. The previous letter has been approved. In addition to ordering the office to reply by Japan, it will be used to verify and handle it. We hereby reply in advance, and we hope you will check and notify. Sincerely yours." It is heard that the branch has informed the company accordingly.</p>
<h3>Industrial Association Submits to Ministry of Industry, Requesting Prompt Issuance of Awards to Hebei-Shandong Needle Factory</h3>
<p>The Qingdao Hebei-Shandong Needle Factory previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry for awards under the Special Industry Encouragement Law. It was sent to the Review Committee for review and decision. Subsequently, the Ministry of Railways replied that the factory's products did not meet the requirements of Article 1, Paragraphs A and C of the Special Industry Encouragement Law, and did not comply with Paragraph B of the same article. It was not convenient to reduce railway transportation fees, and the Ministry approved and notified. Now, the factory has been approved for awards, but the award certificate has not been issued yet, so the rights obtained cannot be enjoyed, resulting in losses for several months. At a time when foreign goods are being dumped, if the government does not provide maintenance, it will not only be unable to compete with foreign goods, but also fear that foreign merchants will take the opportunity to vigorously implement their sales policy. Although shipping transportation fees have been reduced, railway transportation fees remain the same. This type of loss needs to be remedied urgently. Therefore, the China General Federation of Industry has been requested to forward a report to the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the award certificate be issued promptly to reduce the burden and facilitate adjustment. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry has consulted with the Ministry of Railways on this matter. Once the reply arrives, the certificate can be issued.</p>

<h3>Industrial Circle: Organize National Goods Revolving Pawnshops, Implement Production and Sales Cooperation, Resist Dumping of Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Leaders of the industrial circle in this city, Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, etc., believe that if the national goods industry itself does not urgently seek production, sales, and transportation cooperation, it will be difficult to actively resist the dumping of foreign goods, and the future of the national goods industry is deeply worrying. Therefore, based on the purpose of promoting national goods, it is planned to organize national goods revolving pawnshops, in order to seek mutual production and sales cooperation within the national goods industry itself. It is heard that it is being actively carried out. All organizational outlines and detailed plans are being drafted. Once negotiations with the banking industry are completed, revolving mortgages will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Chinese Businessmen: After Representatives of Copper Factories Petition, Ministry of Industry Agrees to Consult Ministry of Finance to Increase Import Tax</h3>
<p>Chinese, Nanchang, China, Huaxing, Qixing, and other copper factories in this city, in view of the fact that Japanese copper is being sold at low prices and dumped, and unscrupulous merchants are seeking profits by secretly importing it, resulting in oversupply and declining business for Chinese factories, with the risk of collapse. Therefore, the factories, based on the friendship of being in the same boat, dispatched representatives to Beijing on the 18th of this month to petition. After Mr. Yu Zhongnan, the representative of the petition, returned to Shanghai, the Ministry of Industry's approval was obtained yesterday, allowing consultation with the Ministry of Finance for handling. Now, in order to achieve early realization, the factories have jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance again, requesting early implementation of the import tax rate, in order to alleviate the hardships of businesses and revitalize industry. The following is the previous report and the Ministry's approval:</p>
<h3>Petition</h3>
<p>Submitting a report on the plan to resist dumping, requesting an increase in the import tax rate to save business operations. Your merchants and others founded the copper skin business with the aim of resisting the intrusion of foreign goods, and have been operating diligently, and the scale has taken initial shape. In the past, factories in our country that specialized in imported copper skin now completely use national goods, because the products are excellent and cheap, and can fully meet the demand. Therefore, foreign goods have gradually disappeared in the past two years, and the rights and interests have been recovered. Your merchants and others secretly rejoice. Recently, Japanese merchants, unwilling to give up the rights they have manipulated for many years, have spared no effort to compete with Chinese factories by selling at low prices. It is heard that there are manufacturers who are greedy for profits and forget their hatred, and are being used by them to import privately. According to the survey, the number of Japanese goods imported has reached more than 5,000 dans in two months, and the goods ordered from Japanese merchants by other factories are not included, which is alarming. According to Japanese copper skin per dan (100 jin), it is only sold for 40 yuan, while national goods must be sold for 50 yuan. According to the cost calculation, national goods must lose 2 yuan per dan. If this continues, the business of our Chinese merchants will be in decline, and the future will be in danger. The reason for the low price of Japanese goods is that their raw materials have copper mines that can be extracted and supplied, while our country does not, so their cost is cheap and sales are easy. It is found that our country's copper skin business is still in its infancy, and it is not easy to compete with Japanese goods. After repeated deliberation, your merchants and others can only jointly prepare a document to submit to your ministry, and transfer it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the import of Japanese copper skin be subject to a dumping tax rate, directly increasing the cost of Japanese copper skin, and indirectly maintaining the lifeline of national copper skin. We hope that you will examine and approve our request, which will be a great convenience."</p>
<h3>Ministry Approval</h3>
<p>"It is found that the low price of Japanese goods is due to the low cost, which does not meet the requirements of Article 2 of the Anti-Dumping Law for goods, and it is not convenient to apply Article 3. As for increasing the import tax on foreign copper, the Ministry of Finance has been consulted for handling."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Convenes Technical Conference on Commodity Inspection, to be Held at the Ministry on June 10</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry will convene a commodity inspection conference and has notified the directors of commodity inspection bureaus in various ports. The director of the commodity inspection bureau in this port and the various directors received the notification yesterday, which was issued in the name of the Technical Research Association for Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Industry.

<h3>Repercussions of Subpoenaing a Lawyer: Since it Violates the Lawyers' Charter, It Should Be Handled According to Legal Procedures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court yesterday, stating, "Regarding the case of Xu Yuying accusing Ji Juemi of offenses against public morals, in which our member Gong Wenhuan is the lawyer, a subpoena from the Criminal Division of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court was suddenly received on the afternoon of January 30, one month after the verdict. The cause of the case is a violation of the Lawyers' Charter. The member went to the court on time and was interrogated by Prosecutor Guo Wei. However, according to the Lawyers' Charter, the discipline of a lawyer should be requested by the Chief Prosecutor of the Local Court. Also, the procedure for disciplining a lawyer is to notify the person to be disciplined in writing to submit a written opinion within the prescribed date, or to summon the person to be disciplined to appear and defend himself. Even if the lawyer is found to have grounds for discipline, the most severe result is expulsion. However, the Shanghai First Special District Local Court did not follow the disciplinary charter and directly issued a subpoena from the Criminal Division and had the prosecutor interrogate the lawyer. This kind of illegal behavior should be corrected by your association in the spirit of justice." According to this, even if a lawyer has violated the Lawyers' Charter, he should be disciplined according to the Lawyers' Discipline Charter. However, directly issuing a subpoena from the Criminal Division and having the prosecutor interrogate him is without legal basis. We hereby inform your court that you should pay special attention to this in the future, for the sake of public convenience."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Reforms Crew System: Seamen's Organizations Meet to Discuss Revisions; Workers Demand Reinstatement After Retrieval of the Jiangjing Steamer</h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is handling crew employment procedures, which has caused dissatisfaction among employees. The union held a meeting yesterday and negotiated with the company. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company implemented changes because it realized that stewards were extorting tips from passengers, making passengers afraid to travel and indirectly affecting business. Therefore, the company specially requested approval from the Ministry of Transportation to handle crew employment procedures. All stewards (i.e., middle-class) and tallymen will be employed by the company and paid wages by the company (stewards and tallymen were originally employed by compradors and were not paid wages, which led to the bad habit of extorting tips). The comprador sales system will be changed to a chief purser and business director system, with actual reporting and sales. The changes will be implemented step by step, starting with the Jiangjing steamer. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also announced to the workers of the Jiangjing steamer that they should follow the regulations and wear uniforms. All stewards, tallymen, and other workers must wear the same uniform and provide a letter of guarantee and a letter of voluntary service. Those who violate any of the following items in the regulations will be dismissed: (1) Drunkenness, gambling, and opium addiction; (2) Fighting and causing trouble; (3) Failure to obey the command of the captain, purser, or business director; (4) Insulting passengers or losing their belongings; (5) Extorting tips; (6) Privately carrying or stealing goods or contraband; (7) Arbitrarily being absent from work; (8) Impersonation; (9) Carrying passengers without tickets or seamen not serving on the ship; (10) Other serious errors that violate the company's regulations.</p>
<p>Joint meeting held. At 8 a.m. yesterday, the Seamen's Union convened representatives from various seamen's organizations to hold a joint meeting. Cheng Deyuan and Wang Zhonggang from the General Union, Gao Yimou, Lu Rongzhi, and Lu Shuangxi from the branch union, Zhou Xiaoting and Wu Shengqing from the Middle Class Guild, Zhao Lunyi, the tallyman representative from the Jiangjing steamer, and Xu Rengui, Wei Jiusao, Zhou Shaoda, and Li Jinsheng, the middle class representatives from the Jiangjing steamer, were present. Gao Yimou presided over the meeting. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) The Middle Class Guild can accept the principle of the company's proposed employment procedures; (2) The original workers of the Jiangjing steamer should be reinstated in their entirety after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company takes it back; (3) The detailed rules of the employment procedures shall be revised and handled fairly by the union, the company, and the relevant agencies; (4) The subsidies for all Jiangjing workers during the suspension of business shall still be supplemented by the company in full according to the previous subsidy method; (5) If the company causes disputes due to the reinstatement of the Jiangjing steamer, the responsibility shall be borne by the company.</p>
<h3>Raising Taxes on滩地 on Both Banks of the Huangpu River: Should be Handled in Consultation with the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau; Ministry of Finance Requests Municipal Government to Investigate</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Having consulted Shanghai Municipal Government Fu Zi No. 3980, according to a report from the Shanghai Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, it was reported on the 6th of this month that the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau announced in Announcement No. 84 that the recovery of Shatian official property within the city and its handling by the city itself had been approved by the Executive Yuan at the request of the bureau in conjunction with the Finance Bureau and implemented on January 1, 1934. From then on, all灘地官荒 and abandoned and useless official roads, as well as Gongbin bases, all land without deeds or taxes that has not been taxed, should be released and taxed by the bureau. It is now stipulated that within two months, the adjacent property owners of the滩地荒浜 road base or the current occupants should be given priority to apply for release, or the adjacent perpetual lease deed holders can also request to add rent to the deed. After this deadline, others will be allowed to freely apply for release. Anyone who wants to take over the land can submit a request to the bureau for verification. The adjacent property owners, etc., must not raise any further objections or obstruct the bureau's rectification policy, which would affect the city's treasury revenue. If they apply to other agencies in the future, all documents, regardless of the ministry's permits, etc., will be invalid. In addition to distributing the announcement and informing the land surveyors to inform the public, etc. According to the investigation, the issue of authority has arisen between this bureau and the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau regarding the tax collection of滩地 in the Huangpu River. This bureau submitted a detailed report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification on September 5 of last year. Although the announcement issued by the bureau this time did not specifically refer to滩地 on both sides of the Huangpu River, this bureau, due to its responsibilities, dared not remain silent. Because the special item of tax collection on灘地 on both sides of the Huangpu River (starting from the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau) should be handled by this bureau in conjunction with the Survey Bureau (now succeeded by the bureau) in accordance with Article 12 of the Huangpu Conservancy Regulations. This regulation was originally made to facilitate the management of the coastal waterline by this bureau in order to achieve the purpose of整治浦江 and developing port services. Over the years, Chinese and foreign coastal property owners have never raised any objections. Before the Huangpu Conservancy Regulations have been amended in accordance with proper procedures, if the municipal government establishes other measures, the coastal property owners and the Huangpu Conservancy Advisory Board will inevitably raise questions based on the regulations, and this bureau feels that it has no words to answer. Moreover, the issue of tax collection on灘地 in the Huangpu River was previously discussed repeatedly by Ziliang and Mayor Wu, although a concrete solution has not yet been reached, and the spirit of harmonious cooperation to seek a solution is mutually understood. The bureau's announcement this time, if it includes the滩地 along the浦江 River under the jurisdiction of this bureau, is obviously contrary to the spirit of previous negotiations. If it is deemed necessary to amend the tax collection of灘地 on both sides of the Huangpu River, it should be requested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consult with the relevant ministers and then order this bureau to comply, so as not to cause disputes. Moreover, all灘地 of this bureau have been reserved for future Huangpu Conservancy or port services, and most of them hold ministry permits. In the future, no one should request tax collection on the land owned by this bureau. In addition to sending the general map of all kinds of land of this bureau to the Shanghai Municipal Government, a copy of the document presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 5 of last year, along with seven blueprints of the ministry permits, is submitted for your review. It is requested that the Shanghai Municipal Government be consulted, stating that before the Huangpu Conservancy Regulations have been amended, all tax collection of灘地 on both sides of the Huangpu River should not be within the scope of the bureau's announcement and should still be handled in accordance with the regulations to avoid disputes, etc., as well as blueprints of the ministry permits. Based on this, after investigation,灘地 on both sides of the Huangpu River in Shanghai is inherently沙田性质 and should be handled in accordance with the Shatian Regulations. However, the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's original report stated that all灘地 of the bureau are reserved for future Huangpu Conservancy or port services, and most of them hold ministry permits for operation, etc., which is also true. Before the Huangpu Conservancy Regulations have been amended, regarding the tax collection of灘地 on the浦江 River, the貴市 government should consult with the bureau at any time to handle the matter in order to avoid disputes. Based on the previous report, in addition to instructing, we hereby request that you investigate and handle the matter accordingly."</p>

<h3>Conclusive Evidence of Corrupt Officials: Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping Accused; Liu Operated Government Bonds Using Public Funds of 410,000 Without Accruing Interest; Yang Purchased Real Estate on Avenue Joffre and Shared Large Commissions with Subordinates</h3>
<p>—Liu's Confession Shifts Responsibility to Wang Boqun—Liu Shufan, former Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau and the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, and current advisor to the Military Affairs Commission in Beiping, from Fujian, sold more than 400,000 government bonds for "Xun Kee" without collecting margin or handling fees. After investigation by the Control Yuan, it was found that Liu was operating the business and using funds from the Savings and Remittances Bureau to cover the payments without accruing interest as required, which resulted in losses to the national treasury. He was impeached, and the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee believed that there was a criminal suspicion and sent the case to the Jiangsu High Court for transfer to the Second Branch, ordering the Procuratorate of the First Special District Local Court to investigate Liu and his accomplices. When Yang Jianping was in charge of the Savings and Remittances Bureau, he purchased real estate on Avenue Joffre and Albert Road, valued at 1.2 million taels. The seller, a Westerner named Du Yi, only received 1.05 million taels. The remaining funds were divided among Zhao Baoshan, the younger brother of Zhao Baomin, the deputy director of the Shanghai Savings and Remittances Bureau, Yang Peichang, the head of business services of the Savings and Remittances Bureau, and Yang Jianping. After investigation by Prosecutor Zhong Qing of the First Branch, it was found that Liu Shufan instructed the director of the Shanghai Savings and Remittances Bureau, Ren, to sell government bonds on behalf of Xun Kee, and the funds were covered in advance, totaling more than 410,000 yuan. When the funds were returned, they were transferred from Liu Jianhou's account. Jianhou is Liu's alias, so it can be inferred that Liu was operating the government bonds himself, which was considered to have caused losses to the national treasury and to have violated the provision that public officials should not directly profit from matters under their supervision. Ren was deemed to have assisted in the act and was prosecuted under Article 136 of the Criminal Law. Regarding the purchase of real estate, the 1.05 million taels received by the seller, Du Yi, were signed and deposited into the Mercantile Bank. The remaining 150,000 taels received by Zhao Baoshan, Yang Jianping, and Yang Peichang were not signed by Du Yi, so it was determined that they had manipulated the price and inflated the value of the property. In addition to Yang Jianping, who was prosecuted by another prosecutor, Zhao and Yang were also jointly prosecuted in the Criminal Division of the same court under the same law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the First Branch of the Special Court summoned the defendants in the Eighth Criminal Court. Except for Zhao Baoshan, who did not appear, Liu Shufan, accompanied by his lawyer Liu Chongyou, Ren, accompanied by his lawyer Shi Ying, and Yang Peichang, accompanied by his lawyers Liu Shifang and Zou Yu, appeared in court. First, Prosecutor Zhong Qing stated the grounds for the prosecution and requested that the defendants be punished according to law. Liu's lawyer then stated that Article 136 of the Criminal Law provides for a sentence of imprisonment of not more than three years, and according to the amnesty decree, those who committed crimes punishable by imprisonment of not more than three years before March 5, 1932, are eligible for amnesty. Therefore, the case is eligible for dismissal and should be decided first. The court stated that whether or not the defendants are guilty should be examined first before a decision is made on whether or not they should be granted amnesty. When questioned, Liu Shufan confessed that Minister Wang Boqun had previously given him 100,000 taels and instructed him to keep it safe, so he used his alias and opened another account in the Savings and Remittances Bureau. The subsequent sale and purchase of government bonds by Xun Kee were all negotiated by Minister Wang's friend Yan Lunshan and the director of the Shanghai branch, Ren. Ren confessed that he had acted entirely on Liu's orders and handled the matter legally. Yang Peichang confessed that the 150,000 yuan for the purchase of real estate was a legitimate commission. Zhao Baoshan took 100,000 taels, he took 29,000 taels, and the remaining 21,000 taels were taken by another intermediary, a Westerner named Li Xun. Judge Liu stated that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered that the hearing be adjourned to a later date. Each of the three defendants paid a guarantee of 10,000 yuan or sought a commercial guarantor, and the guarantor must be responsible for being available at any time. Before the guarantor is found, the defense lawyers are responsible for submitting the guarantee letter before 1 p.m. on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Den Busted in East Tangjia Lane: In Addition to Secretly Selling Red Pills, It Also Provides Smoking Couches for People to Smoke</h3>
<p>Tao A'bing (32 years old), the son of Tao Yinlou, the manager of the Dafugui Restaurant on Zhaojiabang Road near Dadongmen, recently raised funds to set up a red pill den at No. 33 in East Tangjia Lane, Xiaonanmen. In addition to secretly selling red pill drugs, he also provides couches for people to smoke. Because the matter was not kept secret, it was discovered by the侦缉隊 of the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday. Led by squad leader Chen Caifu, they went to the address with Wang Dongfu, the police officer of the third precinct of the first district. They saw many smokers smoking red pills in the den, so they stepped forward and arrested the den owner Tao A'bing and nine smokers, including Tao Wang, Qian A'hu, Wang A'si, Sun Shuangqing, Yang Yuelou, Yan Longshou, Zong Sanbao, and Yang Ziliang. They also seized a large number of red pill smoking paraphernalia, as well as 32 yuan in banknotes and 24 cents in small change, and took them to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the station chief Jin Dianyang, they were handed over to the investigators for further investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Deposits by Employee of China Industrial Bank: Sentenced to a Fine of 500 Yuan and Ordered to Repay the Embezzled Funds</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiongwei, a Cantonese employee of the savings department of the China Industrial Bank on North Sichuan Road, was found to have embezzled more than 18,000 yuan from depositors' accounts between August of last year and January of this year. After the case was discovered, the Hongkou Police Department dispatched Chinese detective Zhu Jihuang secretly to arrest Zhou and transfer him to the First Special District Court to verify the actual amount, which was a total of 18,075 yuan and 44 cents. The plaintiff,延 lawyer, filed a civil suit, requesting full repayment. The defendant admitted the charges without denying them. The case was sentenced to a fine of 500 yuan, which, if converted to imprisonment, would be calculated at two yuan per day. He was ordered to pay 18,075 yuan and 44 cents to the Hongkou branch of the Shanghai China Industrial Bank. During the appeal period, he was ordered to submit a guarantee letter from a reliable shop worth 12,000 yuan. If no guarantee was provided, he would be returned to custody. Yesterday morning, the police and the court sent him to the Third Criminal Court.王耀堂, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that he would abandon the appeal. The defendant expressed obedience to the sentence. Judge Wu Zehan instructed the police to declare that they would not appeal, and the defendant also declared that he would accept the fine and the civil suit judgment and should be sent for execution.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Orders Trust Company to Plan for Ferrying Cars and Goods on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the mayor of this city, Wu Tiecheng, recently saw that the Pudong area is becoming increasingly prosperous, especially in the development of industry. In order to ensure the safety and convenience of cross-river ferries, he has already put into operation the newest type of municipal cross-river ferries on Dongmen Road and other places. Since the operation of these ferries, all sectors of Pudong have felt the convenience, but the original ferries are limited to ferrying pedestrians. With the development of Pudong's factories, the transportation of goods between the浦江 River is very busy every day. After all sectors of Pudong planned to build a new ferry at Dongjiadu, they requested that the transportation of goods be planned for as well. Mayor Wu believed that the request was indeed necessary, so he ordered the兴业信托社 to plan for the new ferry. In addition to the ferries for transporting pedestrians, they should also prepare ferries for transporting trucks. The company is actively planning after receiving the order, so ferries for transporting trucks will soon appear in the浦江 River, which will make Pudong more prosperous and make it easier for the industrial and commercial sectors to transport goods. Moreover, this ferry is also an innovation of this city.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Russian Paraffin Wax Imported: Totaling 150 Tons</h3>
<p>Since the Soviet Union adopted the Five-Year Plan, it has actively encouraged production, resulting in a surplus of agricultural and industrial products. Recently, in order to promote its products, it has tried its best to export them. After dumping glassware and other goods at lower prices, it is now promoting its surplus paper. According to transportation sources, the Russian goods shipped to China are mostly paraffin wax. Yesterday, another 150 tons were imported. The material is similar to American goods, which has further narrowed the market for paraffin wax from brands such as Asia and Socony. The selling price is declining day by day, with each box falling by one to two yuan compared to the previous week. The dumping power is quite terrifying.</p>
<h3>Aviation Highway Lottery: Fifth Period Prize Drawing Held Yesterday; Special Prize Was 284865; Won by a Young Merchant in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The fifth prize drawing of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was held publicly at Yiyuan on Albert Road in the French Concession at 2 p.m. yesterday. Many Chinese and foreign people went to visit. The Ministry of Finance, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce all sent representatives to the meeting to monitor. After checking the prizes and the numbered wooden balls and pouring them into the bronze ball, San Xiaolai, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, reported that the drawing started at about 2 p.m. The first prize was drawn on the second attempt, with the number 274265. However, it was found that it had not been sold, so after all the other prizes were drawn, the number 284865 was drawn as the special prize. According to reporters, the ticket was sold by Qian Tai Qian Zhuang in this city. The buyer was a merchant from Nanjing who won 500,000 yuan, which can be said to be lucky. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Scene at the Venue</h3>
<p>A white cloth banner was hung at the entrance of Yiyuan, with the words "Fifth Period Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Prize Drawing Held Here" written in large characters. Next to it was a prize兑change notice from the office. The layout of the prize drawing area was the same as the previous four times.

<p>Court, the banking sector, the office committee, and advisors were present, totaling about 10,000 people.</p>
<h3>Checking the Prize Numbers</h3>
<p>After the committee members and representatives of various agencies and organizations arrived at about 1 p.m., the supervisors ordered the staff to pour the prize numbers and lottery ticket numbers of each prize level into the three large bronze balls A, B, and C respectively. After that, Wang Xiaolai, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, reported that the fifth period of the Aviation Lottery was held today. All the numbers and wooden balls in the three bronze balls have been checked and found to be correct. Representatives of various agencies and organizations and all guests are also present to monitor. Now that the time has arrived, the event will be held on time.</p>
<h3>First Prize Drawn</h3>
<p>After the report was completed, the small wooden balls in each bronze ball were shaken evenly. The prize drawing began at 2:10 p.m. The first was the sixth prize, and the second was the first prize, with the number 274265. However, after the office checked, it was found that it had not been sold, so it was announced to the public that the first prize ticket had been sent to a car company in Shanxi for sale, but it had not yet been sold and had been returned. Therefore, in addition to the eighth and ninth prizes, which were still based on the last one or two digits of the number, a special prize was drawn again after all the other prizes had been drawn, according to the previous method.</p>
<h3>Seventh Prize Numbers</h3>
<p>After the first to sixth prizes were drawn, the office reported that they were drawing the seventh prize. This prize was originally drawn in the same way as the other prizes, but because there were 500 of them, it took too long. Therefore, since the last time, it was changed to drawing three digits. There were a total of 1,000 wooden balls for this item, from 000 to 999. After the representatives checked them, they were poured into the bronze ball. When "572" was drawn, all lottery tickets with the last three digits being "572" won the seventh prize.</p>
<h3>Special Prize Won in Beijing</h3>
<p>After all the other prizes were drawn, the special prize was drawn.</p>
<p>The guests who came to visit all looked at the stage with keen eyes. At that time, the atmosphere in the entire venue was quite tense. The special prize was drawn at 4:30 p.m., with the number 284865. It was a coincidence that its last two digits were the same as the first prize. According to reporters, the lottery ticket was sold as a whole by Qian Tai De Ji Qian Zhuang on Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road in this city on the 19th of this month. According to the staff of the Qian Zhuang, the buyer was a young merchant from Beijing who was well known to them, so he did not want to reveal his name.</p>
<h3>Remaining Prize Investigation</h3>
<p>According to reporters, two second prizes were</p>
<p>sold by the Hangzhou branch of the Dayun Company, one was sold by the Chengdu Bank of China and Junji Company, and four third prizes were sold. Two were sold by the retail department of the Dayun Company. One ticket, No. 287320, was sold in strips after being批 sold to Zhang Huiqing, an employee of the company.

<h3>Accountants' Association Meeting Minutes</h3>

It was resolved and passed that the matter be ratified. (2) The Standing Committee reported on the calling of the Spring General Meeting of Members and the matter of publishing a notice in the newspaper. It was resolved and passed. (3) The Standing Committee presented the order of business for the General Meeting. It was resolved and passed. (4) The Standing Committee presented the accounting records of the current term for review. It was resolved and passed that they be forwarded to the General Meeting.

The matter of how to handle this was discussed. It was resolved that, according to the association's charter, members have an obligation to pay dues, and should not enjoy rights before fulfilling their obligations. This matter will also be brought before the General Meeting. (6) A letter from Committee Member Jiang Wanping regarding the previous meeting's inquiry to Lawyer Huang Zhong about whether, in addition to submitting reports and schedules, accountants handling routine audit cases are required to provide an attestation. It was resolved that an explanation be requested from the ministry. However, upon reviewing the detailed rules of service for accountants, which extensively cover judicial treatment and procedures for exercising duties, there is no mention of attestation or the need to provide a guarantee. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to request an explanation. The question of whether this is inappropriate was raised for reconsideration. It was resolved that it is unnecessary to request an explanation and that Lawyer Huang be informed accordingly, based on the rules of service. (7) A letter from Member Ye Zhaochang inquiring whether it is legal for an accountant accepting a court-appointed case to request an increase in fees or to collect fees separately from the parties involved, given the low public fees provided.

(10) Committee Member Bei Zuyi and others proposed that the association should suggest to the National Accountants Association that they unify the membership application procedures and routine fee amounts for local associations, so that members may easily transfer to other associations at any time. It was resolved to submit the matter to the General Meeting. (11) Applications for membership from accountants Zhao Shaoding, Huang Zixiong, Cao Yu, and others were resolved and passed.</p>

<h3>Xujiahui: Neighborhood Security Team Leader Abuses Authority - 17-Year-Old Boy Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>The 3rd Platoon of the 10th Team of the South Shanghai District Neighborhood Security Team was stationed on Tang Street, West Ciyou Road, Xujiahui. Two weeks ago, when the tea servant of the platoon went out for business, he locked both the inner and outer doors. A thief suddenly stole the bedding, clothing, and leather shoes from the inner room. The case has not been solved to this day. Wen Guisheng, a resident at No. 127, who is a painter and is 60 years old, has a son, Liangtian, who is only 17 years old. Liangtian was apprenticing at a leather suitcase factory, but is now at home with nothing to do because the factory is closed. The platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon of the 10th Team of the Wudaitou Neighborhood Security Team, Zhang Liangcai, suspected that Liangtian was the thief for no reason on the afternoon of the 24th at 7 PM. He sent team members to arrest Liangtian and forced him to confess at the Wudaitou team headquarters. Liangtian was young and ignorant, panicked and did not know how to answer. The platoon leader immediately ordered that his hands be tied behind his back and that he be beaten. Liangtian was covered in injuries and on the verge of death before the beating stopped. However, he was still forced to confess. Liangtian, unable to endure the pain, confessed whatever they wanted. The platoon leader, seeing that Liangtian had confessed, arrested Liangtian's father at the team headquarters that night and forced him to pay thirteen yuan. Because his family was poor and had no money, the team leader ordered him to sign a note, which had to be returned by the end of the month, before Liangtian was released. Liangtian is now seriously injured and unable to walk. His father is very sad and angry that Liangtian was tortured and forced to confess to a false accusation for no reason. Moreover, the matter falls within the scope of the judiciary. The team not only failed to transfer the case to the judicial authorities but also abused its authority and privately carried out beatings, which is contrary to the original purpose of the people forming the neighborhood security team to maintain local security. The matter concerns the reputation and safety of the people. He has now requested assistance from charitable organizations to pursue legal remedies.</p>

<h3>The Efficacy of "Aotis" Eye Drops</h3>
<p>"Aotis" eye drops are the latest invention from France. After years of research in chemical laboratories and long-term trials by hospital doctors, they have been improved many times. They use the bactericide "zinc oxide" and the anti-inflammatory agent "sodium salicylate," so they can relieve pain, stop bleeding, astringe, soothe, and improve eye health. They can disperse blood stasis and reduce inflammation, treat eye diseases, and give hope for restored vision for nearsightedness and presbyopia. They are also especially effective for treating conjunctivitis, eyelid issues, tear duct problems, eye injuries, and infectious diseases such as scarlet fever and typhoid fever. As for drivers, pilots, those who work at heights, swimmers, those living in the tropics, electrotherapy doctors, and movie actors, because they are exposed to strong electric light, they should especially use "Aotis" frequently to prevent all eye diseases. Remove the eye cup attached to the bottle, pour half a cup of "Aotis" into it, then bend your head down, cover it with the eye cup, then look up and stand upright, open both eyes, then rotate your head left and right about seven or eight times to allow the liquid to flow left and right in the eyes and coat the eyeballs, but do not bend your head forward or backward, so as not to irritate the eyeballs. When the eye cup becomes cloudy, empty it immediately and wash the other eye using fresh "Aotis" according to the previous method. Before washing the eyes, drip a few drops onto sterilized absorbent cotton, use this to wipe the upper eyelids and eyelashes upwards, and the lower eyelids and eyelashes downwards, to remove dust, microbes, powders, creams, etc., so they do not enter the eyes. Wash your eyes once every night, which is good for healthy eyes. If you wear glasses, do it once each in the morning and at night. If you have a cold or infectious disease, do it once each in the morning, at noon, and at night. The price is low and the effect is great. Small bottles are 2.30 yuan, medium bottles are 3.40 yuan, and large bottles are 5.60 yuan. Please pay attention if you suffer from eye diseases.

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Reading Guidance</h3>
<p>After reading the article "Must We Master Foreign Languages?" on March 28th, I felt that there were a few more things to bring up, and I would like you to give me detailed guidance.</p>
<p>I very much agree with your opinion; shop assistants and others with limited spare time do not need to learn difficult foreign languages. Because even for something as simple as English, if you study for one hour every day for six years, your level may not be very good. As for French, German, and Russian, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>My intention of not learning difficult foreign languages is not to say that we should not come into contact with the changing world. But the problem arises; to come into contact with the world, we must have tools. Foreign languages are the only tool, but they are too difficult. Then, would learning an easy language, easier than "English and French," Esperanto, not be the most appropriate solution?</p>
<p>Because Esperanto is an artificial language, its grammar is simple, and the masses of various countries are actively supporting, cherishing, and using it. If you want to read Esperanto books and newspapers, there are plenty for you to read; if you want to communicate with people in the same profession in other countries who know Esperanto, it is also possible, because the Esperanto movement has been popular in various countries for a while!</p>
<p>As for standing on the position of the oppressed nations of the united world; is learning Esperanto not a tool for us?</p>
<p>—Letter from Xiong Zhifo in Guangzhou—</p>
<p>Since we published an article "Must We Master Foreign Languages?" in this column, we have successively received many letters like that of Mr. Xiong Zhifo. They agreed with our opinions on the one hand, and raised the issue of learning Esperanto on the other hand. Now, we would like to give a brief answer to this question.</p>
<p>"Can we learn Esperanto?" When readers ask us this, we undoubtedly answer; "Yes! And it is necessary."</p>
<p>The Esperanto movement has created a very strong atmosphere internationally, which no one can deny. Its significance is not only in the language movement itself, with the possibility of breaking down language barriers between countries, but it also has the meaning of a mass cultural movement in itself. The leader of this movement is the Soviet Union, which accounts for one-sixth of the world. Then, if the masses of our China do not break away from the masses and stand independently, if we also need to join the ranks of the masses of the world, how can we not step up the promotion of this movement, and how can we not learn this only international language - Esperanto?</p>
<p>Some opponents believe that language grows naturally and cannot be artificially manufactured; because before this kind of artificial language and writing is popularized, it is truly difficult for the general public to have the opportunity to practice. If they don't practice, how can we expect it to mature? Understanding the Esperanto movement from the language itself in this way will naturally not lead to correct conclusions. The Esperanto movement matures with the maturation of the entire new cultural movement. If we do not deny that the future world will realize the mass culture one day, we should not deny that there will be a day when a language common to the masses of the whole world will grow. For example, although the Chinese national language movement is still encountering great obstacles, once the remnants of feudalism are completely eliminated and the society has new developments, a new common national language will inevitably develop with the development of politics, economy, and new culture, and it will be protected and established by a very large number of people. Of course, this is not to confirm that the current Esperanto will definitely become the international language in the future, but it can be asserted that the future international language will definitely start from here. Because the current Esperanto is already a conscious movement. Therefore, our learning Esperanto is not only for the simple grammar and easy learning, but mainly for the development of the new cultural movement and for the promotion of the establishment of a truly international language in the future.</p>
<p>In China, although the Esperanto movement already has a considerable foundation, in fact this movement is still in the hands of non-masses. There is still a certain distance from our masses. Not to mention anything else, an Esperanto book is much more expensive than an English or Japanese book. This is a fact. We must overcome these facts. We must not only learn Esperanto, but we must also take this movement back from the hands of a few people and become our own mass movement, that is to say, the Chinese Esperanto movement must turn in a direction. This point is in line with the entire cultural movement.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also say that although the current Esperanto movement is one aspect of the entire new cultural movement, then, when we act as a new cultural activist, if we ourselves do not have more important basic knowledge than Esperanto, our first question is not to learn Esperanto but to obtain basic knowledge, because Esperanto is still a tool after all!</p>
<p>What do you think of the quality? (End)</p>

<h3>Jiangnan University Sports Meet Day 1: Few Special Features in Each Item's Results; Central and Guanghua to Split Track and Field Championship; Central Monopolizes Women's Track and Field Championship</h3>
<p>The 7th Jiangnan University Sports Meet was held at Zhenru and Jinan University yesterday afternoon. The programs consisted of both preliminary and final events. Although the Jiangnan University record was broken in five or six items, there were few special features. Central had great hope in the field events, and Guanghua had the highest voice in the track events. The women's events were monopolized by Central. All of this afternoon will be final events, and the results of the track events may be considerable. Many referees were absent yesterday, and it is hoped that all of them will be present today. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 2:00 PM with the release of firecrackers. After the ceremony was performed as usual, honorary chairman Shen Pengfei delivered the opening speech (recorded below). Then Jinan track and field parent Zeng Rongzhong represented all the athletes in taking the oath. After a hasty matter, the competition began. It was already past 3 o'clock. The text of Shen Pengfei's speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Distinguished guests, fellow students, today is the first day of the Jiangnan University Sports Meet. Because of my position as the host, I was chosen to say a few words on behalf of the organization. The Jiangnan University Sports Meet is a joint organization of several universities in Jiangnan to promote sports. Although I am not particularly specialized in sports, I dare not shirk the responsibility of promoting sports.</p>
<p>Why do we hold sports meets to promote sports? First, without sports meets, it is not enough to arouse everyone's interest in sports, because everyone has a competitive concept. If there is no competition to compare the merits of each person, even if everyone knows the importance of sports, they may not pay much attention to sports. Second, without sports meets, there is a lack of opportunities for mutual assistance and observation, because the excellence of various sports results requires considerable skills. If you want to improve your sports skills, in addition to practice, mutual observation is essential. Therefore, the second meaning of sports meets is to give people greater opportunities for observation.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that the result of this meeting will enable students from various schools and people in society to develop a deeper interest in sports, and also enable all athletes to achieve greater progress as a result of mutual observation. As for the number of wins and losses, it is a common thing in military affairs. I hope that those who fail will not be discouraged because of defeat, but will intensify their practice in order to win the next victory. Also, those who win must not rely on victory and indulge themselves and abandon practice, because our goal should not be victory at Jiangnan University, but victory at the National, Far Eastern, and even World Sports Meets. Therefore, I hope that everyone will work together to create good records in the future in order to obtain national glory.</p>
<h3>Situation of Each School</h3>
<p>Central's winning of the field event championship can be said to be without any problem. Judging from the preliminary review yesterday, Guanghua's momentum is very strong in the track event championship. Guanghua has great hope of scoring in the 100m, 200m, 400m, high hurdles, and medium hurdles. In addition, Guanghua's Dong Shuzhao is sure to win the 800m, so Guanghua's winning of the track championship is actually more certain than Central's. Central has a great chance of monopolizing women's track and field. Yesterday, there was only one men's track final and three field finals. There were a total of four women's events. The scores of each school are as follows:</p>
<p>Men's Field Events</p>
<p>(1) Central ······· 13 points (2) Fudan ····· 10 points</p>
<p>(3) Guanghua ····· 5 points (4) Jinan ····· 3 points</p>
<p>(5) Jinling ····· 2 points</p>
<p>Men's Track Events</p>
<p>(1) Guanghua ····· (2) Daxia ····· 3 points</p>
<p>(3) Fudan ····· 2 points (4) Jinling ····· 1 point</p>
<p>Women's Track and Field</p>
<p>(1) Central ····· 36 points (2) Daxia ····· 5 points</p>
<p>(3) Guanghua ····· 2 points</p>
<h3>Jiangnan University Record</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were four finals for men and women, and the Jiangnan University record was broken in three events. In the men's preliminaries, the Jiangnan University record was also broken in the 100m, 200m, and medium hurdles. However, to summarize, the results are only mediocre. The list is as follows:</p>
<h3>Men's Division</h3>
<p>Event New Record Old Record</p>
<p>1500m Final 4 minutes 32 seconds 4 minutes 36.4 seconds</p>
<p>100m Preliminary 11.3 seconds 11.4 seconds</p>
<p>200m Preliminary 23.3 seconds 24.1 seconds</p>
<p>Medium Hurdles Preliminary 61.2 seconds 61.6 seconds</p>
<h3>Women's Division</h3>
<p>Event New Record Old Record</p>
<p>200m Final 30 seconds 33.4 seconds</p>
<p>8-Pound Shot Put Final 8.08 meters 7.98 meters</p>
<h3>Men's Final Record</h3>
<p>1500m In the 1500m final, Guanghua's Dong Shuzhao and Daxia's Chen Xingpei stood out from the crowd, and the championship was bound to be contested by these two. After the start, the rest were behind. After one lap, the leaders gradually emerged. Fudan's Yang Qingxie and Jinling's Wang Fengting also competed to be the first, vying for temporary dominance. After two laps, Chen Xingpei took the lead and moved forward, with Dong Shuzhao closely following behind, not leaving an inch. After three laps, Dong and Chen made their final efforts to compete for dominance. In the last 50 meters, Chen's speed remained the same, while Dong accelerated and jumped ahead, winning the top spot with 4 minutes and 32 seconds, breaking the Jiangnan University record, beating Chen by six or seven yards. There were three competitors for third and fourth place. Central's long-legged Hu Shixuan was badly defeated. Yang Qingxie was third and Wang Fengting was fourth.</p>
<p>Long Jump Seven people participated. After two jumps, Chizhi's Jiang Xuexin gave up. Guanghua's Hong Yiting was a surprise, and Fudan's Liang Tiancheng and Central's Yang Daogui were all somewhat famous, but unexpectedly they were all defeated. Hong took the lead with 6.33 meters in the second jump. Yang Daogui made repeated efforts, but only got 6.16 meters in the fourth jump. Liang Tiancheng got 6.119 meters in the last jump, and his disappointment can be imagined. The results of the top four are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Hong Yiting (Guanghua) 6.33 meters</p>
<p>(2) Liang Tiancheng (Fudan) 6.29 meters</p>
<p>(3) Yang Daogui (Central) 6.16 meters</p>
<p>(4) Chen Baozhang (Central) 6.10 meters</p>

<p>Discus The results were mediocre, which is disappointing. Ten people participated. In the end, Central occupied three of the six people, and Fudan, Jinan, and Jinling shared the world. In the end, Xu Biao and Wang Zhengyin were eliminated. First place Zhong Jiqing from Central only got 31.675 meters. The remaining three were very average. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhong Jiqing (Central) 31.675 meters</p>
<p>(2) Gong Wanyu (Jinan) 31.14 meters</p>
<p>(3) Ma Qingyuan (Jinling) 30.61 meters</p>
<p>(4) Yin Xiamin (Central) 30.09 meters</p>
<p>High Jump In the high jump final, Central and Fudan shared the sky. Fudan's Liang Tiancheng won first place with 1.66 meters. The scores of the top four were very close.</p>
<p>(1) Liang Tiancheng (Fudan) 1.66 meters</p>
<p>(2) Deng Kanshun (Central) 1.64 meters</p>
<p>(3) Qiu Guangxie (Fudan) 1.63 meters</p>
<p>(3) Zhou Mengqiao (Central) 1.62 meters</p>
<h3>Women's Final Record</h3>
<p>High Jump Only three people participated in the women's high jump. Central's Yu Shufen was eliminated after jumping over 1.075 meters. Huang Zongwen and Zhuang Lingzhao competed for the championship. When it was raised to 1.115, both of them passed. When it was raised to 1.18, Zhuang knocked down the bar in three jumps, while Huang took the top spot.</p>
<p>(1) Huang Zongwen (Central) 1.18 meters</p>
<p>(2) Zhuang Lingzhao (Daxia) 1.115 meters</p>
<p>(3) Yu Shufen (Central) 1.075 meters</p>
<p>50 Meters Only six people signed up, so there was no preliminary round. However, two female generals from Guanghua were absent, so Central monopolized the event. Hu Ruisheng won the championship easily. Zhou Yueying was more than one yard behind. The time was 7.4 seconds, which is still good.</p>

<p>Shot Put Central's Wu Houbai broke Jinan's Wang Lan Yin's Jiangnan University record of 7.98 meters with 8.08 meters. A total of seven people participated. Yu Shufen was disqualified in the preliminary round. Wang Mingyu and Huang Zongwen failed to reach 6 meters in the final and fell to fourth place or later. Wu succeeded in the fifth throw. Liu Kanglin also got 7.62 in the fifth time, jumping to second place. The top four scores are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wu Houbai (Central) 8.08</p>
<p>(2) Liu Kanglin (Central) 7.62</p>
<p>(3) Zhuang Lingzhao (Daxia) 7.345</p>
<p>(4) Jiang Yin Yue (Guanghua) 6.82</p>
<p>200 Meters The women's 200-meter final was also a Central's throne. A total of four people started. Guanghua's Cao Huizhen was lucky enough to get fourth place. Liu Yulan, a female tennis player who attended the Far East Games, was the leader, with a time of 30 seconds. Liu Kanglin and Wu Houbai also shared the third and fourth places.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>Setting off firecrackers before the opening ceremony was novel and lively, but the lack of "blowing and beating" during the parade felt dull. Using two bugles from the Boy Scouts could have added some grandeur. A joker said, "This is all because Lin Yutang's loyal comrades are promoting humor!" However, joking aside, one shouldn't take it too seriously. Work requires a down-to-earth approach; what's the point of extravagance?</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Central's hurdle athlete Wu Xihong made two mistakes, leading to significant setbacks. First, in the second group of the high hurdles preliminary, Wu was originally in first place, but he tripped over the third hurdle, resulting in a failed attempt. Second, in the intermediate hurdles preliminary, Wu could have gotten second place, but unexpectedly, he fell while going over the second-to-last hurdle, leading to disqualification, significantly impacting Central's scoring in the track events.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>In the women's 200-meter final, all four registered participants were accepted. Central had three participants, and Guanghua had one. Guanghua's Cao Huizhen took advantage of a cheap opportunity, falling behind by fifty or sixty yards, but ultimately got fourth place. If Central had added just one more member to the team, they could have gotten fourth place. So, Miss Cao was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>After the meeting, a reporter and Mr. Xia returned to Shanghai from Zhenru, passing Zhongshan Road. The car's speed reached forty motors. Suddenly, they felt the car body swaying, and the front left wheel suddenly came off the axle, flying into the air and hitting an iron bar of a roadside telephone pole, bending it. It had the force of a thunderbolt. The driver said, "This is called a 'flying tire.'" Fortunately, no one was injured, otherwise, a tragedy would have occurred. Everyone thankfully claimed they were sure to win an aviation lottery ticket. After the wheel was repaired, they drove to Jing'an Temple and bought the evening paper to read. Everyone compared their purchased lottery numbers. After a while, everyone looked troubled and silently disappointed.</p>
<h3>Funds for Participating in the Far Eastern Games Still Short by 30,000 Yuan, Association Authorities Extremely Anxious, Ministry of Education's 45,000 Yuan Arrived</h3>
<p>The current Far Eastern Games will open in Manila, Philippines, on May 12th. Our country's authorities have been actively preparing for months, and the selection of various athletes is now nearing completion. They are preparing to depart for the Philippines on the President McKinley on May 2nd.</p>
<p>However, in terms of funding, the budget is set at over 90,000 yuan. Currently, the Ministry of Education has allocated 45,000 yuan, which was remitted yesterday. The remainder is being raised by the Association from enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life. Current statistics show that it is still less than 60,000. With the shortage of funds and the deadline approaching, there is great anxiety. All necessary expenses are being minimized. It is hoped that all sectors will generously contribute to support this grand event.</p>
<p>Shanghai Jicheng Pharmacy, in view of the funding shortage for the Far Eastern Games, generously donated a box of essential medicines to the athletes, which was delivered to the Association yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Far Eastern Games Track and Field Athletes Hold General Meeting, Decide to Participate Unanimously, Advocate Revising the Charter</h3>
<p>(Osaka, 27th, Japanese United News Agency) Regarding the question of whether Japan should participate in the Far Eastern Games, the Far Eastern Games track and field athletes held a general meeting at the Koshien Sports Dormitory at 7 PM on the 26th to decide on a final attitude. All forty-four athletes in the dormitory, along with the general director Okita and other staff members, attended. After discussion, it was decided that all athletes would unanimously participate in the Games. The meeting adjourned at 7:50 PM. At this time, newly made athlete uniforms, hats, shoes, and sportswear were delivered to the dormitory. The athletes were in high spirits and scheduled to hold a record competition on the 27th. On the 28th, they would travel to Kobe with the swimming athletes to prepare for boarding the ship.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Conversation from the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Tokyo, 27th, Japanese United News Agency) Prime Minister Saito, at the cabinet meeting on the 26th, explained the Ministry of Education's policy regarding sending athletes to attend the Far Eastern Games, requesting understanding from all members. The Ministry of Education immediately issued the following statement in the name of Ministry Official Aruya after the cabinet meeting to clarify the authorities' attitude: The Japanese Athletic Association is determined to work towards the issue of pseudo-country participation in the Games at the Philippine Games. The legal method to resolve this issue is to first reform the current charter, changing the rule that it cannot participate in the Games without unanimous approval of the entire association to a rule based on majority vote. The second step is to propose the issue of pseudo-country participation. If both the first and second steps fail and the purpose of pseudo-country participation cannot be achieved, then resolutely refuse to participate in the Games.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Improving Education in Shaanxi Province - Report by the Ministry of Education's Inspector</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent Inspector Zhou Bangdao to inspect education in Shaanxi Province. The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry of Education. The key points for improving education in Shaanxi are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>1.  The work of various sections and offices of the department is still tense. However, Shaanxi Province is vast and transportation is blocked. One provincial inspector is not enough to assign, and should be increased to universally inspect the road.</p>
<p>2.  Most of the county education bureaus have been abolished, which is a pity and should be restored immediately to increase the efficiency of educational administration. If the purpose is to save administrative expenses, the staff of the education bureau may be temporarily reduced to a minimum, and the salary can also be reduced appropriately.</p>
<p>3.  The total provincial and county education funding is less than 2 million yuan, which is a small amount and should be increased year by year to develop it.</p>
<p>4.  The distribution of provincial education funds does not meet the standards set by the ministry. Vocational education accounts for 14%, normal education accounts for 13%, and secondary schools account for more than 70%, which is particularly skewed and should be improved practically.</p>
<p>5.  The Shaanxi Provincial Government is now implementing a unified fiscal policy, and it seems that it is not easy for county education funds to achieve independence in a short time. However, the department should implement the following matters to maintain an independent spirit within the unity: (1) According to the number of education expenses approved by the provincial government, select items that are tax-rich and related to education from the budgeted revenue of each county and designate them as special education funds to ensure a stable source and avoid unexpected effects; (2) Order each county to organize a county education special fund management committee to be responsible for custody and audit; (3) If there are reasonable methods for each county to raise additional education expenses, it should be subsidized to achieve them; (4) Strictly implement the methods for sorting out education expenses in each county that have been ordered, and practically investigate leaks to enrich income.</p>
<p>6.  The location of provincial secondary schools is unevenly distributed. For example, there are only 19 provincial secondary schools in total, and Xi'an alone accounts for 7 of them. The two vocational schools are both in Shaanxi Province. In the vast territory of northern Shaanxi, there is only one women's normal school in Yulin. Shaanxi Province has three normal schools, which are concentrated in the east, while the west is left out. Secondary schools are distributed more widely, but northern Shaanxi still only has one school in Yulin. In southern Shaanxi, except for Ankang and Nanzheng, other places have not been set up. A comprehensive plan should be made immediately and redistributed to achieve balanced development.</p>
<p>7.  Public and private secondary and vocational schools do not indicate the words "primary" or "senior" and the nature of vocational subjects, and the names are too confusing. They should be corrected separately in accordance with Article 3 of the Secondary School Regulations and Article 9 of the Vocational School Regulations.</p>
<p>8.  The names of provincial secondary schools do not follow the regulations to name them after the place where they are located. For example, the First Provincial Middle School should be changed to the First Provincial Chang'an Primary Middle School, the Sun Yat-sen Provincial Middle School should be changed to the Second Provincial Chang'an Primary Middle School, the Second Provincial Middle School should be changed to the Fengxiang Provincial Primary Middle School, the First Provincial Vocational School should be changed to the First Provincial Chang'an Primary Agricultural Vocational School, and the Third Provincial Vocational School should be changed to the Sanyuan Provincial Primary Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School. There is only one provincial senior middle school, which can be called the provincial capital and be named the Provincial Xijing Senior Middle School. Normal schools can be named after the old prefecture names with a wider scope due to regional relations. For example, the First Provincial Normal School should be changed to the Xi'an Provincial Normal School, the Second Provincial Normal School should be changed to the Tongzhou Provincial Normal School, the Fifth Provincial Normal School should be changed to the Hanzhong Provincial Normal School, the Seventh Provincial Normal School should be changed to the Xing'an Provincial Normal School, and the Third Provincial Women's Normal School should be changed to the Yulin Provincial Women's Normal School.</p>
<p>9.  Provincial normal schools can be temporarily divided into seven regions, such as Xi'an, Fengxiang, Tongzhou, Yulin, Yan'an, Hanzhong, and Xing'an, according to the actual local conditions, and various normal schools can be established separately. If it is not easy to set up schools by region due to financial resources, a simple normal course can be attached to the provincial middle school within the designated normal school area to train elementary school teachers for the current needs.

<h3>### Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Pan Gongzhan, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Tianjin and Qingdao Are Flooded with Japanese Goods, and There Are Many Traitors; Tianjin Has Sufficient Educational Funds, and Qingdao's Schools Are Well-Organized</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, went to Beiping at the beginning of this month to attend the annual meeting of the Chinese Academic Society. After the meeting, he took the opportunity to travel to Qingdao, Jinan, Taian, Mount Tai, and other places. He returned to Beijing from Jinan the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 7:15 yesterday morning. A reporter from Shanghai Society visited Mr. Pan and discussed his trip to the north as follows:</p>
<h3>### Attending the Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The annual meeting of the Chinese Academic Society was held in Beiping on April 4th and closed on the 6th. Because there were many papers at the annual meeting, they were read within the meeting. Therefore, after the closing, he went to various schools to give lectures and visited domestic goods factories. On the 15th, he went to Tianjin to visit Nankai University and Nankai Middle School and met with Mr. Zhang Boling. Then he went to Qingdao to visit schools and was convened by the Qingdao Municipal Education Bureau to give lectures to students from six middle schools in the city at the Public Education Center. More than 1,000 students attended that day. He also went to Qilu University in Jinan to give lectures and then went to Taian, Mount Tai, and other places for sightseeing for two days before returning to Beijing from Jinan.</p>
<h3>### Impressions of the Trip to the North</h3>
<p>What I saw in Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places this time is that Japanese goods are very active. The power of the Japanese in Tianjin is very strong, and there is a possibility of danger at any time. Moreover, traitors are very active, especially in Qingdao and Tianjin, followed by Beiping. For example, Huang, the secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Party Department, was assassinated, which may have been done by traitors. As for the educational situation in the North, due to the short time, I did not have time to investigate in detail. When I was in Jinan, I met Director He and visited the Provincial Library, which was very complete. Qingdao has abundant educational funds, and the school buildings in each urban and rural area are very good. The construction funds for the city school buildings reached 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, so the construction is quite well-organized. The educational funds in Beiping used to be allocated from the Chongwenmen tax revenue. Now this tax revenue has been returned to the central government, and the central government allocates 50,000 yuan annually. The funds for the Municipal Education Bureau are not yet in arrears.</p>
<h3>### Municipal Education Funds</h3>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked Mr. Pan about the situation of the municipal education funds. According to him, the new municipal government budget does not increase the education funds, at most maintaining the status quo. Recently, we received an order from the Ministry to establish a complete senior and junior vocational school and a women's normal school in the city within the 23rd year. Not counting the start-up costs of these two schools, the regular expenses require about 15,000 yuan per month. In the upper and lower semesters of the 23rd year, 80 classes will be added to the primary school, calculated at 100 yuan per class, requiring 8,000 yuan per month. The annual salary increase for primary and secondary school teachers will increase by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per month. In addition, the Ministry of Education stipulates that social education expenses should account for at least 10%, but now it only accounts for 5%. If it is increased, it will require about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. These items alone will increase by about 30,000 yuan per month. Currently, the municipal education funds are 1.35 million yuan per year, an average of more than 110,000 yuan per month, which is not enough by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Once the increase is made, the municipal education funds will feel even more difficult.</p>

As of the first semester of the 22nd year, all subsidies due to each district were fully paid yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the association.

<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>New Automatic Volume Control</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Although there are different methods for automatic volume control, its principle is always the same: When the radio receives external radio waves, a new C voltage is generated on the grid of the front high-frequency variable amplification coefficient vacuum tube. The value of this voltage is directly proportional to the strength of the external radio waves. Because the amplification power of the variable amplification coefficient vacuum tube is inversely proportional to the amount of C voltage, when the radio receives the broadcast of local or strong radio stations, it can avoid distortion caused by excessive volume; when receiving distant broadcasts, it can avoid fading and reduce static or other interference. (Please refer to Issue 13 of this publication.)</p>
<p>In the past, the methods of automatic volume control mostly used a separate vacuum tube dedicated to the task. Although this device was very satisfactory, it was actually very uneconomical. Some new radios use double diode triodes to serve as detection, amplification, and automatic volume control, which can save a vacuum tube, but one tube has multiple functions, and the efficiency will naturally be reduced. In fact, it is difficult to have both.</p>
<p>Recently, a new type of automatic volume control has been designed in the United Kingdom, which is extremely simple in structure and very convenient to use.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the internal structure of the device. R is a high-frequency metal rectifier (positive electrode downwards, negative electrode upwards), L is a high-frequency choke coil, C is a capacitor, and R is a fixed resistor. When an external high-frequency current is transmitted to the V2 screen circuit, it is blocked by the choke coil L and travels around the rectifier R. As a result, there is a voltage drop between AB (A end is negative, B end is positive). Its negative electrode directly reaches the VI grid after passing through RI, R2 and the coil L1. The voltage dropped in R changes according to the strength of the external radio wave. In other words, when the external radio wave is strong, the negative grid voltage of the vacuum tube V1 will increase immediately, and its amplification power will decrease accordingly. Conversely, when the radio wave is weak, the negative grid voltage decreases, and the amplification power increases. Its function is the same as that of ordinary vacuum tubes for automatic volume control.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the appearance of the device.</p>

<h3>The Message of Lord Marconi's Sixtieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>April 25th of this year is the sixtieth birthday of Marchese Guglielmo Marconi, the radio inventor who recently came to China and was well received. The International Maritime Radio Committee held a celebration in London, England, on that day on behalf of more than 50 countries around the world. Congratulatory messages were broadcast to the world by radio, and it was decided that April 25th of each year would be "Marconi Day" to commemorate his great success in inventing the radio.</p>
<p>Marconi is already sixty years old, but he is energetic and has the spirit of being strong in his old age! He is still working hard on radio research and is now focusing on ultra-shortwave experiments. On his birthday, he told the London Morning Post in a phone call: "The experiment of ultra-short waves of 50 cm to 60 cm has been successful. It can communicate between Genoa and Leghon, which are hundreds of miles apart, with excellent results. There is absolutely no static interference, and there is no difference in receiving and transmitting all night; however, there are occasional sudden changes, and the reason for this is still unknown."</p>
<p>Marconi also stated that microwaves will surely develop in the future and be used in radio telegraphs, telephones, and movies; radio will surely be applied to industry in the future to benefit mankind.</p>
<h3>Using the New Compound Vacuum Tube 12A7 as a Single-Tube AC Machine</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>In the current trend of vacuum tubes tending to be multi-pole, their internal structure is changing with each passing day, making it almost impossible to distinguish them. For example, the compound vacuum tube is also a new discovery in modern times. The advantage is that one tube can perform more than two functions. Mr. Ban Jie has already described it in detail in the previous issue of this publication, so there is no need to repeat it. The 12A7 described now is also one of the new compound vacuum tubes. Its internal structure and use are slightly different from the types described by Mr. Ban Jie. The tube has two cathodes inside, and the heat is supplied by the same filament. A shield is separated between the two cathodes to prevent the mutual injection of electrons and hinder the work of each part (as shown by the dotted line of the vacuum tube in the attached figure). The upper part is a pentode, which is an advanced version of 47, and the lower part is a diode, such as a 12Z3 rectifier tube. The vacuum tube is specially designed for amplification and rectification, or detection and rectification (as shown in the connection method in the attached figure). Its filament voltage is slightly different from ordinary vacuum tubes. The voltage is 12 volts, and the current is three-tenths of an ampere. When used (according to the figure) as a single-tube AC machine, the B voltage is about 90 volts, and you can use a speaker to receive the broadcast of major radio stations in this city. One tube has two uses, and its work and efficiency cannot be compared with the old-fashioned vacuum tubes. It is also more economical to use it to make radio tubes than ordinary vacuum tubes. As for the attached figure, except for the vacuum tube, most of the others are ordinary parts, so they are omitted.</p>
<h3>Shortwave Knowledge (Continued) The Use of Tuning Dials</h3>
<p>— Wei Xin Su</p>
<p>Ordinary shortwave radios use a variable capacitor and three or four or more plug-in coils for tuning. The wave range included is roughly from 15 meters to 500 meters. Now, if we take out one of the coils for observation, let's say that the wavelength range included in this coil is from 20 meters to 30 meters. At first glance, we may mistakenly think that the wave range included in the tuning dial of a shortwave radio is not as wide as that of a broadcast radio, because from 15 meters to 30 meters, it only occupies a position of 15 meters; while a broadcast radio is from 200 meters to 550 meters, which actually has 350 meters. However, the fact is not the case; what we need to calculate is the frequency range, not the wavelength range. The frequency of 15 meters is 20,000 kilocycles; 30 meters is 10,000 kilocycles, which occupies 10,000 cycles on the tuning dial. Compared with a broadcast radio, 200 meters is 1,500 cycles, and 550 meters is 540 cycles, which only occupies 960 cycles on the tuning dial. Therefore, the wave range occupied on the tuning dial of a shortwave radio is more than ten times wider than that on a broadcast radio. In other words, the position occupied by each cycle on the tuning dial of a shortwave radio is more than ten times smaller than that on a broadcast radio, that is, the position occupied by each cycle on a broadcast radio is equal to the position occupied by more than ten cycles on a shortwave radio. If we understand this situation, we will know how patiently and slowly we should move the tuning dial when using a shortwave radio. Using a shortwave radio in a hasty manner is bound to fail.</p>
<p>Time Difference</p>
<p>If you want to receive foreign broadcasts, you must understand the time difference relationship between the longitudes on the earth. For example, the RV49 of Moscow, Russia, starts broadcasting every day at 8:00 PM Greenwich Standard Time, which is 4:00 AM the next day in Shanghai. The W3XAL of the United States broadcasts in New York at 8:30 PM Greenwich Standard Time, which is 4:30 AM the next day in Shanghai. The GSE of the United Kingdom starts broadcasting in London at 2:30 PM every day, which is 10:30 PM on the same day in Shanghai. If we want to receive the radio broadcast of a certain place at a certain time, we must always remember the time difference between them. The time difference of each longitude on the earth is one hour for every 15 degrees, one minute for every 15 minutes, and one second for every 15 seconds. For example, if it is 8:00 AM in Shanghai, it is 9:00 AM in Tokyo, 6:00 PM in Chicago, 7:00 PM in New York, and 12:00 midnight in London.</p>
<p>Distance Time Difference Globe Anyone who has a shortwave radio should have a globe. We can obtain the longitude distance between the broadcasting location and the receiving location from the globe, and then divide it by 15 to get the time difference between the two places. If we want to find the distance between the broadcasting location and the receiving location, we can directly measure it with a thin line, which is far better than measuring it on an ordinary map with a scale, because the curvature of the ground cannot be ignored in the measurement of longer distances.</p>
<p>Interference Problem</p>
<p>Although the shortwave radio reception is less affected by static interference, and can even achieve good results under thunderstorms in summer nights; the opposite is true for man-made interference. All electrical machinery such as streetcars, automatic telephones, electric fans, neon lights, electric motors, generators, and water-cooled engines, automobiles, airplanes, etc., will generate more interference on shortwave radios than ordinary broadcast bands. Therefore, the location of the antenna for installing a shortwave radio is extremely important. If the location where the radio is placed is close to the above-mentioned interference source, a shielded lead-in wire and a reduced disturbance antenna device must be used. The method of reducing the disturbance antenna device will be described in detail in another article.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Contributed by Philips</p>
<p>(1) The emergence of vacuum tubes and their budding era; the history of vacuum tubes for radio reception is exactly 50 years. The principle was first obtained from the great inventor Edison. Edison inserted another electrode into his early carbon filament light bulb and experimented to find that there was current flowing between the filament and the newly inserted electrode. This phenomenon is the so-called Edison effect.</p>
<p>The first vacuum tube put into practical use was Fleming's diode (1905). Later, in 1911, it was improved by Von Lieben. The vacuum tube was 25 inches high, and the structure was still based on the initial one, but a grid electrode was inserted. In 1917, vacuum tubes began to be sold on the market, and the vacuum tubes at this time had been considerably improved. In 1918, Philips' first vacuum tube (D-type tube) was born in response to the times. The tube could obtain a filament current of 0.5 amperes at a voltage of 4 volts, and its screen voltage was between 30 and 40 volts. At that time, there was no high-voltage power supply, and the required screen current could only be obtained from dry batteries or small storage batteries. Its "low vacuum" vacuum tube (D2) was valued at the time because its screen voltage only needed 20 to 30 volts. Later, the "post-grid tube" was born in response to the times, and its screen electrode only needed 20 volts. The excellence of the result can be seen here. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Internal and External News</h3>
<p>The current situation of the American Wireless Radio Company: The Stereo radio of the company's manager, Stewart, has long been well-known. In addition, the Gilmer radio is also one of the famous and expensive radios. Its seven-tube long and short wave machine is even more distinctive. It is said that this time a large number of new radios have arrived in Shanghai, all of which are the latest models. A big sale will be held in early May. At that time, the store will be crowded with people. Those who have not prepared a radio should hurry up to get one first. In addition, the latest model of Salmon bulbs managed by the company are the soul of radios. A large batch of them are now in stock. Radios that do not receive very clear signals should be equipped with them.</p>
<p>Tian Er Wireless Radio Company: The company has recently launched photosensitive batteries, which are sold at low prices and are durable. The company's repair department has been expanded. All radio repairs will be delivered within 48 hours, which can be said to be extremely fast. Those who need repairs during this plum rain season, please send them to No. 35 Renji Road to the company.</p>
<p>Special News on Radio Repair: The Yada Company, located at 24 Nanjing Road in this city, was originally established on Renji Road. Due to business development and expansion, it moved to a new location last month. Since the company specially established a radio repair department last year, it has taken the lead in promoting free inspection to serve the society. The precision and thoughtfulness of the repair work and the satisfaction of customers can be seen from the special achievement of repairing more than 2,000 radios in the past year. Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been cold and warm, and radio problems have sprung up. The company's repair department is facing an endless stream of customers.</p>
<p>Yada Company adds a radio manufacturing department: Yada Company, located at 24 Nanjing Road in this city, has recently added a manufacturing department, specializing in manufacturing radio broadcasting stations, naval, land and air force radio stations, and long and short wave wireless telephone and telegraph machines. The company employs specialized engineers to provide customers with design consultation on all wireless radio facilities and engineering, and the organization is very complete. K]</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Spring Scenery by the Lake</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>From Yixing to Nanjing, the car travels along Tai Lake for half an hour. The distant mountains, near mountains, and far mountains in the lake are all clearly visible. Sometimes a single sail floats like ink, and sometimes clusters of trees separate the green. The vast water and the vast expanse of clouds and sky are like an endless scroll of autumn mountains unfolding. Yuantouzhu is decorated without any gaps, leaving only Yuantou pure, still able to travel and broaden the mind. Xiaoji Mountain is entirely man-made, and is as luxurious as the villas of the wealthy in West Lake. It is suitable for living in seclusion, almost forgetting that it is in 36,000 acres of raging waves. I have long heard of the beauty of Rensheng's East Great Pond, and I took a detour to visit it on the way back. The other places are indeed secluded and moving. If you carry a basket, store food, carry a pot of wine, and have two or three close friends, sit on the grass and have a picnic. Forest flowers fall on your sleeves and dance, and mountain birds sing along with the drink. For a moment, you become a fisherman in a paradise. Is it not a wonderful thing? It is a pity that I came and went in a hurry, and the spring rain was like silk, making it unbearable to stand for a long time, which is regrettable. Yixing has East Chou and West Chou. Next to West Chou is Xuetang, Diaotai and other scenic spots. Sparse willows shake green, reflecting the water like a beauty facing a mirror. Distant mountains overlap with verdant greenery, and chaotic clouds connect with white clouds, creating a natural painting as a backdrop. If someone like the people of Wuxi can embellish it, it will not be difficult to become the second West Lake. Su Dongpo has the line "I will buy a field in Yangxian and grow old, from now on I will only love the streams and mountains," which does not seem to be an overstatement. The mountains surround Yixing, and the beauty of the caves is faster than Linwu. The mist and rosy clouds of West Lake have been compared. The Gengsang and Shanjuan caves are deeply hidden in the mountains, and it is not easy for tourists to reach them. Since the opening of the Yixi Highway, it has become convenient. However, traveling by boat and car still cannot reach the destination early in the evening, and entering the mountain to visit the cave requires physical strength. Therefore, delicate women who cannot bear the fatigue, although they arrive, are not happy. Among those who visited Gengsang were the painter Chen Juan, Mrs. Wu Xiaru, and four female students from Yixing Girls' Middle School who met unexpectedly. They all followed the crowd and traveled back and forth on the fields for twenty miles, which can be said to be healthy. However, after visiting Gengsang, followed by Shanjuan, Ms. Wu also declined to follow. In fact, Shanjuan has a basket to replace walking, which is less strenuous than Gengsang.</p>
<p>The mountain of Gengsang is called Mengfeng, and the mountain of Shanjuan is called Luoyan, named after the shape of the cave. On the western foothills of Luoyan is Bixian Nunnery, where Zhu Yingtai studied, which seems to be a forced connection. The most ridiculous thing is that there is a village called Zhuling about three miles away from the mountain, which is said to be the burial place of Zhu Yingtai. Whether the person existed cannot be proved. Even if the legend is believed to be true, her traces are not in Jingxi.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hu Puan was the head of the civil affairs hall, he had a plan to build Tai Lake Park. Documents were piled up like mountains, and discussions filled the hall. However, because this matter was of great importance, there was no way to start. When the person left, the government was abolished, and the influence was lost. However, since the Beijing-Hangzhou Road and the Yixi Road have been completed halfway around the lake, if the Suxi Road is advanced and the Dongting East and West Mountains and the Lian Ferry of Shigong Baoshan are planned, the prototype of Tai Lake Park will be formed.</p>
<p>Tai Lake is known as a den of thieves, and those who hear it are wary. Tourists are always careful. However, since the highway has been opened, the people live in peace, which is more peaceful than before. It can be seen that transportation and public security have a deep relationship.</p>
<p>South of the Yangtze River, only West Lake is a place for both the elegant and the popular, suitable for both women and children. Since the people of Wuxi embellished the mountains by the lake, tourists have become more prosperous, because it is easy and provides complete preparations. Therefore, every time there is a break, families come from Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Changzhou in an endless stream. The appeal of plum blossoms is the strongest, but the spring scenery by the lake does not necessarily need plum blossoms. Even red peaches and green willows are quite beautiful and pleasing. If it is in early summer, it is suitable to cross south to Dongting, and until late autumn, you have to leave the lake and enter the mountains. Among the cities along the lake, only those belonging to Wujiang are the most plain and unremarkable.</p>
<h3>Travel Companions</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>Traveling and enjoying the scenery is the only pleasure in life. If you can accompany it with a superior companion, the pleasure will be even more eternal. The so-called superior companion does not distinguish between men and women, but those who are good at one art are the best; some are good at photography, some are good at painting, some are good at music, and some are good at writing. Wherever they go, they discuss literature and art, embellish the lakes and mountains, and in addition to the clear tour, they also contribute to the beautiful scenery, which is very beneficial. This is taking beneficial friends as travel companions, which is the best of travel. In addition to beneficial friends, there must also be close friends. This is limited to one man and one woman, and no third person can participate in the question. On the lips of the boat, in the belly of the car, by the waterside, and on the top of the mountain, all shadows are double, and all shoulders are next to each other. Wherever they travel, they find beautiful mountains and rivers, and they point and laugh at each other. Even if there is a debate, the meaning is also very pleasant. The joy of this is beyond words. In March of the year of Wuchen, I stole a day off and once traveled with her to Liangxi. I passed through the Plum Garden, went to Wanqing Hall, and set sail on the lake to take in the beauty of Yuantouzhu. The spring scenery of 36,000 acres seemed to pour into our arms. Then I took the post to Wuchang, stayed briefly at Liuyuan West Garden, climbed Tiger Hill to mourn Zhenniang, and worshiped the Mandarin Duck Tomb. Wherever I went, I lingered and forgot to return. Whenever she saw a good couplet, she would record it and make a small heart-shaped booklet by hand after returning, writing it in floral script and giving it to me for safekeeping to record the flying snow. Time waits for no one. Now, six years have passed in a hurry. Thinking of the past travels, it is like a lifetime away. This is one of the most memorable pages in my life history, and it is also the most enjoyable event in my life's travels. Now I will attach it to the discussion of travel companions</p>
<h3>Spring is in West Lake</h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>Once spring arrives, the natural landscape of West Lake becomes more enchanting and charming, making it even more lovely.</p>
<p>The water in the lake is no longer as thin and barren as in winter, unable to cover the mud at the bottom of the lake. It is full and sparkling, serenely settled, plump and smooth like a woman's breasts, and dragonfly-like yachts glide lightly on it. People lie reclining in the boat, looking out at the lush green mountains surrounding them, and they feel relaxed and happy beyond words.</p>
<p>Strands of undulating songs gently leak out from each yacht, weaving and shrouding the lake surface, intoxicating the hearts of every tourist.</p>
<p>The weeping willows on the lake bank draw out strands of tender green branches, swaying gracefully in the wind. The emerald green velvet-like grass is interspersed with some delicate red, tender yellow, and light white flowers, decorating the West Lake very gorgeously.</p>
<p>The aroma of meat and the fragrance of rouge fill the surrounding air. From the short, narrow sleeves, one after another white lotus-like arms are exposed, hanging on the arms of every suit-and-tie man. The swaying waist makes the alluring curve even more obvious. The round and delicate legs are vaguely revealed under the red and green cheongsams, leaking endless spring scenery.</p>
<p>Indeed, they are the "spring" sensitives; the ornaments on the lake bank weave the lake bank into a brocade with their comings and goings.</p>
<h3>A Small Scene in a Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Fragments of a Travelogue of Songjiang: I'm hungry, so I walked into a restaurant. The fish are kept in earthenware jars, and the meat is hung on iron hooks, which is really tempting.</p>
<p>"Let's just stay downstairs, it's the same food!" I said. I was looking at a girl standing in front of the table over there.</p>
<p>"We rarely come to Songjiang, why don't we go upstairs and have a good meal?" Hu Chenzhou insisted on making a fuss. Wang Zhuo also agreed: "Okay, let's go upstairs, let's go upstairs--" There was no way to think, striding up the stairs slowly. How could they know my worries? Worries that cannot be told in front of others... The upstairs is very quiet, there are no other customers, four corners, quietly, putting that tabby cat to sleep. The three sons walked to the window, opened the window, and the warm and drunk spring light poured in without any barriers, and the soft wind threw on their faces like cotton balls, throwing on their hearts, happy, happy. However, the heart sank suddenly, palpitating, jumping, young people, after all, can't stand the temptation of spring.</p>
<p>Lonely people, will they continue to be so lonely?</p>
<p>"Let's drink some wine, such a spring!" Hu Chenzhou patted my shoulder and smiled.</p>
<p>So they drank wine. Wang Zhuo ordered a basin of raw shrimp, which were still jumping alive in the basin. I couldn't bear to eat them, but their limbs had already been cut off. I clamped one and immersed it in wine, letting it be anesthetized, letting it not feel the pain of being gnawed by teeth.</p>
<p>"The same death, perhaps, your means of anesthesia are even more violent in the eyes of others!" Hu Chenzhou said.</p>
<p>When I couldn't think of an answer, I took a big gulp of wine and leaned on the windowsill, looking at the little boats downstairs, only a shallow line of water left. Several boats with masts near the shore were stranded on the mud, and the spring sunshine was climbing on them. Where there was no sunshine, a faint black shadow spread out.</p>
<p>On the opposite bank, the flat cobblestone street, white walls, black doors, and clear outlines of small buildings lay quietly in the lonely atmosphere. On the left, a single bridge, like in a picture, some vendors, some girls, some old people were coming and going on it. I love this mainland style street. "I want to live here, I love the tranquility here." When they called me to eat perch, I said to them like this. Wang Zhuo nodded, and Hu Chenzhou also nodded, just eating fish in silence.</p>
<p>"How good is the taste of fish?" I was a little angry.</p>
<p>"How good is the strength of watching girls?" they mocked.</p>
<p>They laughed, the three sons. The laughter startled the sleeping tabby cat.</p>
<h3>Angry Brush in the Desert</h3>
<p>— Poet of the Great Desert</p>
<p>The wild dry wind blows stones and phosphorus. Ugly foxes squint their eyes and ghosts lift their lips. Maybe spit blood to defile the world. Straight to burn the body and scorch the imperial palace. Where are the eight dragon kings? The six roots and three poisons are still human to me. Sighing to the empty sky and facing the vast calamity. A lonely shadow should follow the moon in a circle.</p>
<h3>Traveling to Qili Creek</h3>
<p>— Chen Shicheng</p>
<p>Qili Creek is where the Han hermit Yan Ziling fished and traveled. Ziling's name was Guang, also known as Zun, a native of Yuyao, Kuaiji. Emperor Guangwu repeatedly summoned him, but he refused to come out; he personally visited him, but he insisted on lying down and refusing to get up. He was later appointed as a remonstrance official, but he refused to yield; so he farmed on Mount Fuchun. Later generations named the place where Chun fished Yanling Shoal. The events are recorded in the Biographies of Hermits in the Book of Han. Fuchun is Fuchang; the change of Chun to Yang is to avoid the taboo of Empress Zheng of Emperor Jianwen of the Jin Dynasty.</p>
<p>From Hangzhou up the Qiantang River; ninety li to Fuyang, and another ninety li to Tonglu; thirty li south of Tonglu is Zhanbei, and further in is Xukou. From Xukou to Luzi there are about thirty more li, which is named Qili Creek. The peaks stand opposite each other on both sides of the river, the mountain势 is winding and the water flow is turbulent, possessing the body of the Wu Gorge but slightly lesser. The reason why it is named Qili is calculated according to the time of the boat trip; the so-called seven li with the wind and seventy li against the wind is also.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the evening on March 29th, I took a special car from the Yousheng Travel Agency to Hangzhou and stayed at the Tongshang Hotel on Nanxing Bridge. The next morning, I went to Jianggan to take the Qianjiang Company's Xinjiangxing Ferry to Tonglu. The ferry has two shifts, one in the morning at 7:30 and one in the evening at 8:30; the departure times are only one hour apart. The water is shallow by the river, and the ferry is large and cannot dock near the shore; although the ferry terminal protrudes into the center of the river for half a li, boarding the boat still requires crossing. The boat started at 8:05. The peaks on both sides undulate, forming wave shapes. The peach blossoms are already budding, and the ridges still have snow. There are many sandbars in the center of the river, planted with trees, sparsely and appropriately arranged. At this time, the rain had just cleared, and the river water rose sharply, flooding the sandbars. The green willows and weeping willows only revealed their tops. The clouds and trees reached the mountains, the chaotic currents and the setting sun flickered, like traveling through a watery country, sighing in admiration.</p>
<p>At 4:20, I arrived at Luzi; I entered Qili Creek. The mountains stand opposite each other on both sides of the river, towering high, steep and dangerous. The width of the river is uncertain, and the twists and turns are mysterious. Looking ahead, I doubted that there was no way to go. Looking back at the stern, I lost where I came from; looking down at the shadow of the sail, and looking up at the mountain light, the pine needles dripped with green, and the peach petals showed their beauty. The mountain path was like a thread, and the woodcutters returned, vaguely in the mountain village. The cooking smoke was like a wisp, and I almost thought I had entered a painting, and the boat was traveling at the bottom of a pot. The ancient poem "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, I doubt there is no way out, but the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and another village" is almost close to it. Small waterfalls are seen along the way; the boatmen say that the beauty of Qili Creek lies in the many stone beaches, the water is shallow and clear, and the dangerous stones are scattered at the bottom of the water, which can be counted one by one. Now the water is rising and carrying sediment, and this scene cannot be seen, which makes me feel sad for a long time.</p>
<p>At 4:45, I arrived at Yan Ziling's Fishing Altar, with two stone altars standing majestically on the mountainside, facing each other on the left and right. Small pavilions are built on them, which can be climbed. The boat travels fast and cannot stay. According to the Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Guang fished at Yanling Shoal, and Gu Ye Wang's Geography Record said that "Qili Beach is under the East Yang River, connected to Yanling Shoal." According to this, then Qili Creek is probably Gu's so-called Qili Beach? Then where is his so-called Yanling Shoal? Could it be that the creek combines the beach and the shoal and is named? Or why is it named with the same Qili as the beach? Gu also said that "South of Tonglu County is Yan Ziling's fishing place. There is a stone on the side of the mountain, which can seat ten people up and down, facing the water, named Yanling Fishing Altar." Now the altar stands high on the mountainside, about two hundred feet away from the water, so how can one fish, which is inconsistent with Gu's "facing the water" statement. Could it be that the vicissitudes of life are different from the past, like this! If Si Huai can fish, then Hangzhou will be a watery country. Although, Ziling is the descendant of Chao Xu, and his bright integrity and high moral character still make people admire him endlessly after a thousand years. Those who beg for mercy in the dark and flatter people in broad daylight, can they not be ashamed to death in front of him? Then the altar is named after Ziling, so there is no need to ask whether it is a fishing place.</p>
<p>At 6:10, I passed Xukou. The creek ended here. The mountain势 expanded, the waves were also calm, no longer as dangerous and narrow as before; and the shadow materials and paintings of Hu Boxiang and other sons who traveled together were already full of boxes.</p>
<p>Chatting</p>
<h3>Research on Inkstones (33) Appendix</h3>
<p>— Idle Guest</p>
<p>The Duanxi Inkstone History of Sanwu Lanxiu records Liu Gongquan's discussion of inkstones, emphasizing Duan, She, and Lintao, followed by Chengni and Tongque tiles, while those below Ji Shiqian are not included. I also collect more Duan stone inkstones, fewer Cheng and She inkstones, and only two or three Tao stone inkstones. There are only one or two tile inkstones. Ancient Tao stones are rarely seen in the world, and there were many fake ancient tiles in the Tang and Song Dynasties. Even if you want to find fake ones from the Tang and Song Dynasties now, you can't find many.</p>
<p>In the past, people discussed inkstones, focusing on the quality of the stone. If the quality is good, it doesn't matter if it's not an ancient pit, or if there are no inscriptions by famous people. Wang Zhitai said that he valued antiquity in inkstones and fragrance in inksticks, which is a vulgar view. Wu Lanxiu said that engraving inkstones must be passed down with the inkstone and the person, and the writing and characters must be unique. If you pretend to understand things and follow mediocrity, you will mix up surnames and names, disobey ancient methods, and contaminate this Duan friend. Shi Yushan said that recently, officials have given gifts to dignitaries, and most of them ordered craftsmen to carve various stars, seas, clouds, dragons, landscapes, and people's hands, which, although extremely exquisite, add vulgarity and are also a disaster for the stone. My opinion is the same. In the early Qing Dynasty, inkstone lovers could not bear to recklessly engrave a famous material, so they wrapped it in a brocade robe and treasured it. Therefore, there are still good inkstone slabs circulating today. I have several inkstone slabs that are still worth seeing.</p>
<p>My ancestors left several ancient inkstones from the Song and Ming Dynasties, and I have also obtained dozens of good inkstones from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The stone quality and works seem to be not bad. Recently, because of my sixtieth birthday, I received three Tao green inkstones from my colleagues, which can be said to be destined for inkstones. Therefore, I changed my studio name to Inkstone Fate, and also recorded the kindness of my colleagues that I will never forget.</p>
<h3>Idle Letters</h3>
<p>— Two more letters from Mr. Idle, published together on the left</p>
<p>One said, a guest came and saw me writing about inkstones, and suddenly said, "You are responsible for promoting the new culture. You enjoy the life of the new life. Why talk about the old?" I said, "How strange are your words! Don't you see that today's new culture does not make a living in the old culture? Don't you see that today's new life does not make a living in the old life? Ancient is old. To restore the ancient is new. To restore the ancient is old. To restore and add new, ancient and mixed with the present, is called harmony, which is new. To restore without restoring, to abolish without abolishing, without the present and the ancient, without the new and the old, is called the middle way, which is renewal. How can there be peace in the new and the old?" Moreover, my discussion of inkstones is just to suit my nature. It is acceptable to cover the jar, and it is acceptable to wipe away the dirt. It is also acceptable to make gold-clad brocade and place it on the table. Laughter and scolding are acceptable, and contempt is acceptable. It is also acceptable to regard it as serious and respect it as art. Criticism, praise, destruction, and let everyone do it. The guest said, "According to your words, why not submit it to the Spring and Autumn of Shenbao, which is not new and not old, and stands in the middle way?" I said yes, so I took it to Zhou Junshou Juan. Idle Guest's knowledge. The second said that the more exquisite of the inkstones collected in idleness. Originally, it was intended to print the inscriptions and rubbings of each inkstone after the text. However, due to the limitation of the position, it was too small and unclear, so I gave up the discussion. It is very apologetic. Now, I plan to pre-consult with the curator. If there is interest in the future, I will revise the article with supplementary materials. Add ink discussions and print separate editions. The rubbings will also be made into plates and published together. I don't know if it will be as wished (End)</p>

<h3>Aesthetics and Life</h3>
<p>— Xu Maohou</p>
<p>In André Gide's reflections, there is the following passage:</p>
<p>Baudelaire has a sentence:</p>
<p>There, everything is order, beauty, glory, tranquility, and happiness. (See Invitation to Travel)</p>
<p>In the eyes of a careless reader, this is just a list of nouns. However, I have discovered the complete definition of a work of art from it. I first consider the content of each noun individually, and then I am amazed by the beauty and effect of the bouquet-like beauty composed of all of them. Because there is not a single word that is unnecessary, and every word is arranged very appropriately. It is very appropriate to use these nouns as the titles of each chapter of aesthetics, namely</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Order (logic, theoretical composition)</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Beauty (line, dynamism, side)</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Glory (regular fullness)</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Tranquility (shaking stillness)</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Happiness (carnality, beauty of material, charm)</p>
<p>Indeed, the realm that meets these five elements can be said to be a perfect realm, and the work is also the most perfect work of art. However, such a realm is not found in the human world, so Baudelaire can only imagine this kind of realm described in poetry. He said that in that place, the dim sun appeared in the hazy sky, like the charming autumn waves revealed in the tearful eyes of children. He said that in that place, all the decorations in the room had a special flavor; he said that in that place, the whole world was shrouded in warm brilliance. He called "my children, my sisters" to go there together, fall in love with that place, and die in that place.</p>
<p>However, such a realm is not found in the human world, so no such perfect work of art can be produced in the human world. Without the foundation of a fulfilling life, all aesthetic standards are unattainable. However, many artists die and hold on to aesthetic standards. Whenever they write, they often first think about the completion of art. In other words, they want to use the aesthetic realm of fantasy to enrich life or cover up the emptiness of life.</p>
<p>Tolstoy had long opposed such building art on fantasy aesthetics. He said that future art should be engraved on another foundation. "Art is not a profession, it is the expression of true feelings. Therefore, artists can only experience true feelings when they are not isolated and when they live a natural life in the world. So those who escape life must be in the worst state of creation."</p>
<p>Life and aesthetics are of course indispensable for artists. But we should not adapt life to aesthetics, but see aesthetics from life. Aesthetic life is an empty thing, and the aesthetics of life is true art. Since this is the case, aesthetics has no fixed standards, and the old aesthetic standards are definitely not to encompass today's art. Because the aesthetics of life is extremely complex and constantly evolving.</p>
<h3>The Research of Formal Demeanor</h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>When I founded *The Analects*, I believed that a solemn and moralizing demeanor was the enemy of humor. It wasn’t because moralistic writings could resist humorous literature, but because the environment of moralizing and the lack of understanding of humor would inevitably affect the writing of humorists, making them feel as if someone were glaring at them from behind while they wrote. This is not conducive to humorous writing. Only by maintaining a bit of innocence and arrogance, and ignoring this kind of gloomy, cold-blooded atmosphere, can one write a bit of humor. The influence of this formal demeanor can be seen in the submissions and critiques of *The Analects*. In terms of criticism, the new and old moral guardians have been quite consistent recently, and the solemn demeanor is becoming increasingly heavy. Anything that is not whining and complaining literature, or crooning literature, is despised. Some people today, although writing in vernacular, are actually deeply poisoned by moralizing in their subconscious, and any small matter is immediately linked to saving the nation or destroying the nation. Thus, using domestic toothbrushes is also saving the nation, selling perfume is also saving the nation, making people unable to have peace in any action. Some people study abroad, learning chemical engineering, clearly learning to make perfume and tanning leather, but they must say that it is saving the nation through industry. In fact, they are all used to saying phrases like "nowadays" and "the state of the world and the hearts of the people" in their essays since childhood, and these phrases are still at work in their subconscious. Therefore, although these people's terms are new, their attitudes are old, and they are not products of Western culture, just like politicians and bureaucrats. They are not worthy of criticizing the telegrams of important people about "nowadays". Westerners discuss women's clothing only as an aesthetic issue, but in China it becomes an issue of ethics, morality, or the differences between the Chinese and the barbarians. Westerners see solar eclipses only as astronomical research, but in China, they become omens related to the order and chaos of the world. In the West, there are also people like Stephen Leacock, who, as a university professor, writes humorous essays because of his nature, mocking photographers for posing and twisting people's necks, and neither the author nor the reader thinks about "literary orthodoxy" or "the rise and fall of the nation." However, humorous literature has therefore developed. If a Chinese person like Lao She writes an essay like "Eating Lotus Seeds," someone will ask, what does writing these things have to do with the state of the world and the hearts of the people, and what benefit is it to Chinese culture? Isn't this the evil influence of the Tongcheng School still at work? Because of this, writers are also unconsciously oppressed by this group's solemn demeanor, and when they pick up a pen, they must regard themselves as satirizing the world, so pure humor is shrouded in ardent and even sour satire.</p>
<p>What is the matter with running a humorous publication? It's just running a humorous publication, why make such a fuss? Originally, in foreign countries, various serious publications still allow for several humorous publications. But in China, it is not so. One family is humorous, every family is humorous, it must "be popular for a while, everyone imitates it." Therefore, those who praise humor praise it in terms of the state of the world, and those who destroy humor also destroy it in terms of the state of the world. This is just like a foreign Ph.D. who has specialized in literature for a few years and is still wet behind the ears returning to China and being praised as a literary expert, with unspeakable suffering, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. In fact, I, Lin Yutang, have no ambition. It is only because of my nature, I have always disliked the long-windedness of *The Eastern Miscellany*, and I like miscellaneous and rambling talks. Since there is nowhere to publish such articles, I have to run one myself. Fortunately, someone publishes it and someone buys it, so I have been messing around like this. At most, it is just adding a small, not-very-serious publication to the various serious magazines that already exist in the country, to adjust the atmosphere. I have never intended to overthrow serious magazines, nor have I forced everyone in the world to write humorous articles. Now, when criticized, it is again about whether I am saving or destroying China. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Folk Song</p>
<h3>Climbing on the Cart - Hebei Folk Song</h3>
<p>— Junru</p>
<p>Young - lady, climb on the cart, - climb, climb until after noon, my legs are sore and my stomach is hungry, the old woman throws a corn bread, take a bite, so sad! Jump into the well, the well is so deep; jump into the river! The river is so wide: holding the eaves, I call to the heavens, my eyes are red and tears are streaming down.</p>
<h3>The Addiction of Buying Books (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liu Dajie</p>
<p>After returning to China, my interest in buying books shifted to thread-bound books. Two years ago, I especially liked buying collections of Ci poetry, from the Five Dynasties, the Song and Yuan dynasties, and the Ming and Qing dynasties. I would buy back any that I liked. After a year, the results were not bad. Last year, my interest in Ci poetry collections waned, and I liked to buy collections of essays by scholars from the late Ming dynasty. These books are much more expensive than Western books and poetry collections. Each book is only three to five thin volumes, but they often cost fifty or sixty dollars. And they are not often seen in bookstores. The fewer the books, the more expensive the price, and the more I want to buy them. Sometimes the money for paying rent and buying rice is also sent to the hands of the old shopkeepers of the bookstores. This has led to our small family always being short of household expenses. I haven't added a single piece of clothing this year, and the soles of my leather shoes have holes, but I'm too lazy to care. Even my wife's few pieces of extremely worthless jewelry have been pawned off by me.</p>
<p>One day, my wife gave me seven dollars and told me to go to Sincere Company to buy a can of milk powder for the child to eat. When I went, I planned to buy the milk powder and come back, but after getting off the streetcar, I felt that it was still early, so why not go to the bookstore to take a look! As a result, those seven dollars were sent to the bookstore again, and I boarded the streetcar home in the dim light, holding a few tattered books. I don't need to write more about how my wife scolded me that night and how the child cried in bed from hunger.</p>
<p>Everything is afraid of becoming an addiction. Once it becomes an addiction, it's like becoming addicted to smoking, and it's hard to quit. I remember that George Gissing's novel titled "The Odd Women" tells the sad story of a person who is addicted to buying books. Last year, I happened to talk to Mr. Yu Dafu about this work, and he said, "Only book addicts like us can understand the merits of this novel." Every day when I feel the pain of not having money to buy books, I think of the protagonist in that novel and his sickly wife.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have always been a person with a job, big or small, but I don't have a penny left in my hand. When I see a book, I want to buy it, but I don't have money to buy it. This kind of pain is not far from the pain of an addict who doesn't have money to buy opium. However, only those who have been through it can understand this kind of pain.</p>
<p>Recently, in a letter I wrote to Mr. Lin Yutang, I said, "The school owes salaries, I have no money in hand, and I am addicted to buying books, what should I do?" At first glance, these three or four lightly written sentences seem to be small-talk correspondence, but in my personal experience, I feel a bit of real bitterness.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>— Guo Ming and Xie Yunyi jointly</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Lin Yutang's article in today's "Free Talk" involves our publication. Therefore, we are sending a letter to be published in "Free Talk" to clarify the truth. We would be grateful!</p>
<p>Guo Ming and Xie Yunyi jointly</p>
<p>To Lin Yutang:</p>
<p>Today, we read your article "Zhou Zuoren's Method of Reading Poetry" in "Free Talk," which involves our edited journal *Ren Yan* ("Words of People"); saying that *Ren Yan* and other publications have also made systematic attacks on your *Ren Jian Shi* ("This Human World"). After reading it, we sincerely feel compelled to speak out.</p>
<p>Only you know the relationship between *Ren Yan* and you best. Your announcement in *The Analects* last time, we did not want to say much. This time, regarding *Ren Jian Shi*, although various parties have made comments, *Ren Yan* has not said a word. In your anger, you may have mistaken a deer for a horse, but we have created right and wrong out of thin air, which was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>It is your preference not to advocate literary sketches, and we have nothing to say. But in all fairness, the phrase "the only success of Chinese modern literature in the past fourteen years is the success of literary sketches..." has the suspicion of "the ugliest child is the best to his own mother." You advocate "humor," and it is appropriate to be unrestrained, but recently your works only show anger. Should advocates of humor be like this?</p>
<p>Literary sketches are just a literary form, and there is no need to advocate or overthrow them. In our opinion, arguing and explaining is too "naive"!</p>
<p>We admire your efforts for literature, but opinions differ. Nowadays, the political tide is trending towards XX, and when you talk about national affairs, you often use ... to despise it. However, looking at your recent remarks, there is a trend towards literary dictatorship, which is surprising. As friends, we offer this advice. If there are any unresolved issues that need to be taught, if the scope is limited to personal differences of opinion and is not related to the overall situation, it is best to arrange a face-to-face discussion. Otherwise, there will only be traces left between pen and ink, which will lead to people's ridicule that you are "skilled at climbing the social ladder," which you would not want. We cannot express everything in this letter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<h3>Homecoming Trip</h3>
<p>"Ah, that is the hotel where people stay," he said, half explaining to himself and half inquiringly. He told me about the hotel, and also told me which one was the best. He could have gone straight to Guangfu from Yudao, but he also turned into the town of Mudu. When passing a teahouse, I asked him to go in and have some tea. There were only two or three other tea drinkers in the teahouse, and he seemed to know them all, talking casually with them. I asked him if he wanted to eat some snacks, and he said he had just eaten a lot at Guanqian. Because he still had to hurry on his way, he left after sitting for a while.</p>
<p>Before leaving, he thanked me again and again for a few cigarettes and a cup of tea. In fact, I hoped he would tell me his address in Guangfu, maybe I would go to see him.</p>
<p>After asking about the location of the Shi Jia Restaurant, I also left the teahouse. After walking a few steps, I saw a Shi Jia Restaurant, but it was literally selling rice and didn't have a place to stay. After crossing a bridge, on the riverside of Xiatang, I saw the six words "Shi Jia Restaurant Hotel" on a white lime wall. I walked in. A waiter led the way. When I arrived at the first reception room, the waiter was opening the door to a room. Just then, I saw room number seventeen. I asked him if it was available. He said no. I opened it, because I liked that number.</p>
<p>Thinking of going somewhere to walk around, I sat for a while and then left the Shi Jia Restaurant. After thinking about a few places to go, I finally decided to go to the river beach that I had longed for so much in my childhood.</p>
<p>I can't remember the exact age now, but it was always before the age of six, because after the age of six, I left this hometown to study in Suzhou City. The house where I lived was next to a river that ran straight through the town of Mudu, which was a confluence between the Grand Canal and Taihu Lake. Across the river was a beach, where many ducks would always be leisurely grooming their feathers during the day, or going down into the water to swim freely. I really loved that scene. I often stood by the window watching them, intently, enviously. I really wanted to go among them, but it seemed so far away and unattainable, although it was the most memorable place in that section of my life. I never went there, although I had returned to Mudu countless times.</p>
<p>Now I am walking there in recollection. It's not far from the Shi Jia Restaurant, so I arrived in a few minutes. The river beach seems to be the same river beach, and the ducks seem to be the same ducks. I stood on the small bridge over a tributary, watching them, watching them leisurely grooming their feathers and swimming freely in the water. I also looked across the river at the house where I had spent some of the beginning years of my life, but it didn't seem familiar to me.</p>
<h3>A Novel of the Middle Ages (II)</h3>
<p>— Written by Mark Twain, translated by Zun Han</p>
<p>"Listen to me carefully. You must remember every word I say. We have a law as old as the Germans,"</p>
<p>"That any woman who has not been legally crowned in front of the people, even if she sits on the Duke's throne for a moment, must be put to death. Therefore, you must remember my words. You must pretend to be humble. You can only read your judgments from the Prime Minister's seat under the Duke's throne. You must continue to do so until you have been crowned and rescued. Maybe your gender will never be discovered, but we in this treacherous earthly life had better take precautions in everything."</p>
<p>"Ah, Father, does my life have to become a lie because of this? Why should I deprive my innocent cousin of her rights? Please spare me, Father, please spare your child!"</p>
<p>"What, you wretch! Is this how you repay me for preparing such supreme fortune for you! I swear to you, this mawkish face of yours does not suit my character. Get on your way to see the Duke immediately, and be careful not to resist my plans."</p>
<p>This was the conversation between the father and daughter. We can imagine that the lovely child's prayers, requests, and tears were useless. Nothing could move the stubborn heart of old Duke Klugenstein. Therefore, the young woman had to watch the gates of the Duke's mansion close behind her with sadness, and she was escorted by a group of servants on horseback, advancing in the darkness.</p>
<p>After his daughter left, the old Baron was silent for a while, then turned to his mournful wife and said:</p>
<p>"Madam, our affairs seem to be going smoothly. I sent the clever and handsome Count Detqing to seduce my brother's daughter Constance fully three months ago. If he fails, we will not be able to succeed completely; but if he succeeds, there will be no power in the world that can prevent our daughter from becoming a Duchess, even if misfortune should prevent her from ever becoming a Duke."</p>
<p>"My heart is filled with terror. But everything still has a chance to succeed," replied the Baroness.</p>
<p>"Tch! Madam! Don't worry yourself unnecessarily. Let us go to sleep and dream of Brandenburg and its majesty!"</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Six days after the events described in the previous section, the splendid capital of the Duchy of Brandenburg shone with magnificent military regalia, resounding with the cheers of loyal people. The Duke's young successor, Nna, had arrived. The old Duke's heart was filled with joy, because Nna's dignified appearance and elegant demeanor immediately moved him. The halls of the Duke's mansion were full of dignitaries, who all received Nna with great courtesy. The future was foreshadowed from those moving and happy colors, so the old Duke's fears and anxieties were all dispelled, replaced by a sense of joy and satisfaction.</p>

<h3>Financials: Silver Prices Fall Slightly; Gold Prices Rebound by a Small Amount of Three Yuan and Four Jiao</h3>
<p>The gold market trended towards stability yesterday, silver prices fell only slightly, and the market was dominated by sellers. There were still embers of short squeezes, which were launched from time to time, but the 20 yuan mark was difficult to sustain. Although a small rebound was seen at the end of the day, there were still many price surges along the way, but the strength was not as strong as the day before. In the early morning, due to the slight contraction of silver prices in overseas markets in the UK and no movement in the US, the opening price of forward silver on the Precious Metals Exchange fell by just over one cent, and the closing price contracted by varying amounts from three to five li, which was particularly weak. Exchange rates also did not rise or fall. London raw gold rose one penny, US cotton continued to fall, US wheat was flat, and the wool market opened down to 11-12 yuan. In general, short sellers saw that people's hearts were still stable and came to cover their positions. Unexpectedly, the latent upward trend was rekindled, and the bulls took advantage of the situation to raise prices, and another surge was reported, again breaking through the 20 yuan mark. There were not many transactions, because it was difficult to take action in this chaotic situation. When the price rose above 20 yuan, there were more sellers, and then it retreated to 17-18 yuan. Later, Mitsui paid 33.125 yuan for August US dollars, which was blocked by the Dalian gang, agitating people's hearts. The price broke through the 20 yuan mark again, and finally retreated due to the lack of decline in silver prices and the diligent supply of high-priced sources. After the opening, a telegram reported that the silver faction in the US Congress accounted for two-thirds of the vote and would definitely be able to pass silver legislation with a majority to override the President's veto. The sellers originally wanted to act, and the domestic market turned loose and fell. Later, the banks continued to pay, and the rumor that Seattle futures silver fell by just over one cent, the upward trend had not yet disappeared, and it once again broke through the 20 yuan mark, but the gold market rose sharply, and the silver price did not increase much even though it fell by one hundred pounds, so the afternoon closing still retreated. Although there was a period of firmness in the afternoon, the overnight silver price suddenly rebounded and still fell, mainly because the sellers were still unwilling to exert their strength easily, and the situation was still stable. In today's international market, the gold market can still stand, and the bullish psychology has not disappeared. The price of red gold is estimated at 1030 yuan, with a swap rate of about 2.5 yuan. The daily market conditions are recorded below: The morning opening was 1018.5 yuan, a slight increase of 0.4 yuan compared to the previous closing. The goods opened at 9 yuan. The exchange market quoted recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling and 3 pence and 3125, and US exchange at 32.75 yuan. Shanghai blocked August US dollars 125, and Macquarie blocked the same month 1875, which gradually declined from 9 yuan, and Fuchang, Richang, Yuqing, Yongzhi, Feng, Yongyingfengheng, etc. sold out, retreating to 3.2 yuan. Sumitomo ate August US dollars 3125, and Macquarie, Mitsui, and Huqiao paid half a yuan for September, and Fuchang, Yongde, Dadecheng, and Tongchun came in, rising back to 6 yuan. After entering, it was learned that the listing should not be moved, and people's hearts were empty. July US dollars 25 were difficult to sell, and Zhifengyong, Richang Yida, Yongyuanchun, Fuxingyong, etc. sold out, falling to 1.3 yuan. The goods Hengyu and Fuan bought in, and although they returned to 2.8 yuan, Yitaiyong, Hengtai, and Hengxing still sold, still at 1.3 yuan. Yongfeng, Cuitai, Shunmao, Daxing, Yongzhifenglai entered, and Meifeng Huabi did 125 for June US dollars, rising back to more than 4 yuan, and Fuxingyong, Yidayong, Dadecheng, and Shengda sold out and retreated to 2.5 yuan. After entering, the situation hovered, and people's hearts were still stable, struggling around 3 yuan. When Zhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Yidayonglai entered, and Macquarie paid 625 for September US dollars, it gradually rose again to 6 yuan. Datong Huabi also paid 125 for June US dollars. Mitsui Macquarie blocked 33 yuan for June US dollars, and Yuanmao Yong, Shengda, and Fuxingyong sold out, and it fell again to 3.7 yuan. After entering, the situation was confused, and the turnover was reduced, and it was difficult to grasp, but the remaining embers of short covering had not been completely extinguished. As soon as there was a buyer, the shorts were anxious again, so Yuanchun Hengxing Dadecheng, Yongde Fuchang Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyonghengyu, etc. entered, and the price of gold soared again. Mitsui paid 375 for September US dollars and then became tense again, and then it was coaxed to 20 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengxing Zhifengyong and Yongde sold out, and the downstream immediately retreated to within 18 yuan. Fuxingyong Fuchang still entered, and it rose again to 9.5 yuan. Yidayong Yongde goods, etc. sold out and retreated to within 6 yuan, and the afternoon closing was 1016.2 yuan, and the goods were auctioned at 6.3 yuan.</p>

<p>Dalian gang Fuxingyong Fuchang came in, rising to 5.8 yuan, Yongde Fuyu Hengxing Yidayong sold tickets, Huabi blocked July US dollars 125, and then retreated to 4.4 yuan, but because Macquarie paid another 25 for August US dollars, Hengxing Fuxingyong Yuqing Yongfuchang and others scrambled to buy, rising to 8.2 yuan. Overnight silver prices rebounded by 60 pounds, and Hengtai Hengyu Zhifengyong Dadecheng and others sold to within 6 yuan. Although there was a rebound, it was not as good as Fuxingyong Shengda's sale of tickets, retreating to 5.5 yuan, and Fuchang bought domestically, and there was still a struggle. Sumitomo blocked August US dollars 25, Fuxingyong Shengda Yidayong Dadecheng Yuanmaoyong sold out one after another, and fell to 2 yuan. Mitsui continued to pay 4375 for September US dollars, and Zhizhi Yongfuchang took the opportunity to pay in low and turned stable,</p>

After the closing, Yuan Changyong Cuitai sold tickets, falling to within 4 yuan, Bingxing Yuanmaoyong still paid in and remained flat, and then scattered households sold out, and Shengda Hengyu Dadecheng also supplied, and even retreated to within 3 yuan. Checking that the highest price in one day was 1020.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 1011.3 yuan, there was a difference of 9.2 yuan. As a result, it fell back by 3.4 yuan compared to the previous closing,</p>
<p>The closing price was that the HSBC Bank's US exchange listing did not move, still at 32.625 yuan, and the combined standard gold price was 1060 yuan, as the closing price said, about 46 yuan, which was more than 3 yuan more than the previous closing. May's account was 1019 yuan, June's was 1016 yuan, the morning water replenishment was 1019 yuan, and the afternoon water replenishment was 1018 yuan.

The HSBC official exchange rate was announced, with no changes to British pounds or US dollars, but banks continued to bid on the dips, ultimately resulting in improvement, reportedly due to a decline of over one cent in the Seattle silver market. The market opened hesitantly and evenly, and later, Seattle nighttime silver prices suddenly rebounded by 6% and trended easier. The closing price for near-term selling price was British pounds at one shilling three pence three one two five, US dollars at thirty-two yuan eighty-seven cents five, compared to the previous close, reflecting a British pound easing of .0625, and a US dollar strengthening of .125. Chinese merchants tentatively sold over 300,000 US dollars and bid for over 100,000 British pounds. A record of today's transactions is as follows:</p>

<h3>Financial Market Fraught with Peril</h3>
<p>April, traditionally the most active period for silver and money businesses, is especially so towards the end due to the high demand for silk and tea funds, surpassing even the end of October. However, this year, due to the financial sector's wariness amid the decline of all industries and exceptionally cautious lending practices, coupled with the accumulation of cash in Shanghai due to internal unrest, a distorted situation has emerged. Currently, the unfavorable conditions in the North primarily affect the financial sector. Consequently, the long-term prospects this year are unremarkable, barely enough to maintain appearances. Yesterday's long-term transactions involved new deals of over 2 million and settlements of over 3.4 million. The overnight interest rate increased by one cent compared to yesterday, with both morning and afternoon markets at six cents, plus two cents for "hua tou" (commission). Discount bill transactions involved over 5 million in morning market transfers and new transactions, over 200,000 in afternoon market transactions, and over 300,000 in small exchange transactions. Foreign banks received over 2.7 million in ticket payments, over 7.2 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateral deposits, and miscellaneous payments, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 500,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks received over 3.3 million in ticket payments, over 6.8 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateral deposits, and miscellaneous payments, over 700,000 in customs duties, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 400,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Japanese banks received over 3.5 million in essential payments, over 550,000 in various goods, foreign exchange, collateral deposits, and miscellaneous payments, and 300,000 in warehouse entries. Money shops received over 43 million in foreign public bills, over 6.7 million in "yang hua tou" (foreign commissions), over 600,000 in remittances from various routes, and 5-600,000 in cash receipts. Foreign collateral deposit transactions amounted to over 1.7 million in withdrawals and new deals, over 2.3 million in banknote withdrawals and issues, 200,000 from client sources, and 450,000 in outflows.</p>
<p>Additionally, the total exchange volume at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 27th was 28,721,626.21 silver yuan, including 3,667,870.85 silver dollars and 25,053,755.36 silver yuan in exchange drafts.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Small Silver Soars by Nine Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver soared due to the widespread demand in the cocoon market, with factories dispatching personnel to seek supplies, causing sudden tension in the market. The morning opening was 4.5 yuan higher than the previous day, reaching 845.5 yuan. The afternoon market, due to insufficient receipts, rose again by 4.5 yuan, reaching 850 yuan. As a result, it increased by 9 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 9,000 "jiao" (units) in the morning and 13,000 "jiao" in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver was 745.3 yuan in the morning and 745.2 yuan in the afternoon, resulting in a slight decrease of 1.7 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 35,000 "jiao" in the morning and 25,000 "jiao" in the afternoon. Copper coins fell by 1,000 "wen" (copper cash) compared to the previous day, at 326,500 "wen," with a trading value of 10,700 silver yuan, equivalent to a quantity of 34,925 strings and 500 "wen."</p>
<h3>Securities - Increased Trading Volume in April Bonds</h3>
<p>Today marks the closing of large-month futures. Yesterday, April 27, was the settlement date for April futures on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The total settlement amount was 40,058,500 yuan, in 961 items, with 96 bonds accounting for 6.8 million yuan, the highest among all bond settlement amounts. Salt Tax bonds followed with 5.45 million yuan. Out of the total settlement amount, 26,380,000 yuan were settled independently by various brokers through account transfers, while the settlement amount at the exchange was 14,200,500 yuan. The settlement amount was larger than before, with loose goods dominating the deliveries, and profiteers accounting for the majority of the receipts. The April futures had only been trading for over fifty days, and since its debut on February 27, the market conditions have been better than in any other month, trending almost in a straight upward line. Since the resolution of Sun Chuanfang's rebellion, there have been no major setbacks in the environment. The shorts have failed repeatedly, covering their positions each time they sold, and the market price rose each time they covered. From the start of trading until April 2, only seven or eight days were marked by sideways stagnation, with new high prices reached almost every day. On April 9, the market price suffered a sharp blow due to Japan's reckless declaration and the issues of postal and railway connections in North China, but it rebounded to over half of its previous value the next day. However, since this disruption, public confidence has been weak and slow to recover. Currently, the international atmosphere is increasingly serious, and the bond market is swaying under the pessimistic sentiment. However, atmosphere is not fact, and war is not child's play. In the short term, it will be mostly limited to verbal and written conflict. The future need not be overly pessimistic. The highest and lowest prices of troop reduction bonds differed by more than seven yuan, and salt tax bonds differed by nearly five yuan. If not for Japan's reckless actions, salt tax bonds reaching 70% of face value would not have been impossible. If Japan softens its stance and the North China issue is resolved, the bond market could rebound and flourish. Starting today, we will add trading in June futures. Below is a classified list of the April futures settlement amount, transfer amount, and total trading volume (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Initially Stable, Then Falls</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Yang Hong, the stock market was initially quite stable yesterday, but later, as Secretary of State Hull stated during his appearance before the Senate that the world was in a state of panic and the United States was about to encounter an unprecedented economic crisis, speculators became pessimistic and vigorously sold off their holdings, causing the market to decline. Financial experts also urged Congress to quickly pass the tariff bill as a precautionary measure. Therefore, despite the presence of positive news, such as the resolution of the railroad labor dispute, it was overshadowed. Industrial rayon stocks were among the biggest losers, falling by over five yuan. Small transactions also fell, and bond prices fluctuated. US government bonds declined. According to reports, although selling pressure was intense, resistance was strong. Metal and specialty stocks were hit hardest. (Wheat) Crop news continued to be alarming, with drought persisting in the Northwest, which is extremely favorable for buyers. Shorts are likely to toil in vain. (Cotton) The possibility of inflation gradually diminished. Factories sold off their holdings, and cloth sales were slow. Therefore, some people say that yarn factories will reduce production. According to reports, farmers are dissatisfied with their allocated reductions in planting areas. Bulls have apparently liquidated in large quantities, but the market still shows signs of volatility and instability. Further progress awaits new stimulus. (Sugar) The market was calm, and spot prices continued to improve. (Rubber) The close was strong, with manufacturers buying, suggesting continued gains. (Silver) Shanghai and London were weak, so prices fell sharply in the morning. Later, because the May contract was supported throughout the day, it rebounded. Total daily trading volume was 1.64 million shares. The Dow Jones averages are listed below:</p>
<p>April 25	April 26	Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks	105.05	103.56	Down 1.49</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks	49.92	49.32	Down 0.60</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks	26.08	25.63	Down 0.45</p>
<p>40 Bonds	94.99	94.82	Down 0.17</p>
<p>11 Commodities	50.74	40.31	Down 0.43</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Marked Yarn and Cotton Turn Soft Again - No Trading Today Due to Settlement</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains sluggish. However, most people still anticipate lower prices and continue to sell on rallies, so selling pressure is still heavy. However, it is reported that about 20-30,000 bales of future and spot yarn have been purchased by buyers from South and North China, greatly easing the factory's situation. However, most of the purchases were 10s and 16s coarse yarn. Inquiries about the inventory in the exchange's warehouses are scarce. Marked yarn is still under pressure, but the underlying inventory is lower than before.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Decline</h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, the sentiment was flat due to the fall in American cotton. However, spot yarn sales remain active in the north, and Sichuan buyers are also active. Prices for various months rose and fell by 1, 2, and 3 dimes. In the afternoon, prices for various months fell back by 1, 2, and 3 dimes. Total daily trading volume was 9,050 bales. It is reported that Taichang sold 700 bales, Yuanda 400 bales, Mingde 650 bales, Tongxing 450 bales, Yuantai 750 bales, and Changfeng 700 bales. Deji bought 350 bales, Yuda 350 bales, Dafeng 700 bales, Yuantai 300 bales, and Senkang 350 bales. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>September	174.6	174.3	174.3 0.60	18,300</p>
<p>Total	179,350</p>
<h3>Customer Sales Are Still Good</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still active. Statistics on purchases show 146 bales were purchased. The market is flat. Buyer groups: Inland 563, Sichuan 400, Peers 3, Nanjing 10, Guangdong 200, Ningbo 6, Yunnan 160.</p>
<p>The cotton market has softened again due to the sharp decline in American cotton. Fortunately, the exchange rate contracted, offsetting the effect. However, calculated prices have fallen over the past two days. However, sellers are holding tight due to low inventories, so the market is still firm amidst the softness. Spot cotton sales in the market are sluggish.</p>
<h3>Cotton Falls by 2.5 Dimes</h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, prices fell by 2-2.5 dimes following American cotton. In the afternoon, the price for the current month rose by 5 cents, while prices for other months remained flat. Total daily trading volume was 49,600 "dan" (units). It is reported that Changfeng sold 8,800 "dan", Hengyi 1,100 "dan", Yuanda 1,400 "dan", Mingde 1,000 "dan", Taixing 1,200 "dan", Shenji 1,100 "dan", Dachang 1,100 "dan", and Tongfu 900 "dan".

<h3>American Cotton Bulls Liquidate and Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market weakened because the majority of bulls liquidated their positions, the cloth market was poor, and Southern sellers sold off. As a result, spot prices fell by 20 points, and futures prices fell by 19-21 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 12 points, and futures prices fell by 4-7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 11 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to selling by European exporters, then rebounded due to buying by speculators. As a result, Pinggal and Omlah both fell by 3 rupees, and Bairochi fell by 3 rupees and 2.5 "jiao". Original telegraphic records on the left (dated 26th):</p>

<h3>Grains - Bull Liquidation Leads to Softness in Flour Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for all months showed a continuous declining trend. Although foreign wheat quotations showed little fluctuation, with Chicago only up by four cents and Canadian wheat up by about eight cents, the sentiment inside and outside the industry remained consistently depressed after the opening. The exchange's margin calls have been overwhelmed by the environment. This is because various businesses are offering unprecedentedly low prices for all kinds of grains. Compared to the recent flour prices, the flour prices are still higher than the prices of various grains. The sluggishness of the actual sales businesses is likely due to this reason. The market's weakness is not without cause. By the afternoon opening, the near-term contracts showed further declines as the bulls were eager to liquidate their positions. The forward contracts also weakened due to customer selling and depressed sentiment. Looking ahead, the market is likely to remain difficult to recover. As a result, the current month fell again by two cents, May and June fell by 1.5 cents, July fell by 1.25 cents, August fell by 0.5 cents, and September fell by 0.75 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months showed a consistent weakening trend. Foreign wheat quotations showed little fluctuation, and the weather has turned clear and mild. General speculation is that the weather will lead to a bumper harvest. In addition, various grain prices are in a continuous period of decline, so the peak season for new wheat is unlikely to be favorable. As a result, the market continued to decline step by step. Although selling in the market was not smooth, the market was ultimately sluggish due to environmental pressure. As a result, the June contract fell by 3 cents, the July contract fell by 2 cents, and the August contract fell by 4 cents. There were no comparisons for the remaining contracts. Spot wheat remains inactive as factories remain unmoved.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>(Henan) Yesterday, there were over twenty sources (over 4,000 ). Late rice was the majority, with a small amount of thick "geng" rice. Customer purchases were slightly smaller. Both the North and South "Yang" groups purchased about 1,000 bags. Due to seller reluctance, the market remained stable. Although thick "geng" rice shops were available, the public sentiment remained firm due to the overcast sky, and the market appeared stable. "Du Yang" and "Yin Bian Yuan" rice showed no gains or losses.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were twenty-one or two sources from various places in Hexia. In the market, white "geng" rice had the best sales, followed by high-quality rice. "Jiaozhongguan" rice was stagnant. The same was true for "Bu Jian" and "Ke Jian" rice. Early rice was slightly discounted. There were not many thin rice arrivals, and sales were also average. "Bai Yuan Yang Jian" rice was relatively active. Arrivals and sales of "Yin Yuan" rice were balanced. The market price of white "geng" rice was slightly higher, and the price of high-quality "Yang Jian" and thin rice was firm. Medium-quality and lower-quality rice were also weak, down by 3-5 cents. "Bian Yuan" rice continued to be repaired close to the corner. "Bu Jian" rice was trending weak, while the price of "Du Jian," "Ke Jian," and "Yin Yuan" rice remained stable.</p>
<h3>Customer Sales of "Ke Xian" Rice from Fujian and Zhejiang Continue to be Smooth - "Xiao Jiao" Rice Increases by Three Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for "Ke Xian" rice seemed to be trending lower, because sources were abundant but outflows were decreasing. However, after the market opened yesterday, the appetite in Fuzhou did not decline, and the "Yongshao" group from Zhejiang province, which had recently been advising in the market, competed for purchases. Quanzhou, Wenzhou, and Taizhou also made some minor purchases. Total market transactions were 7,338 bags, with Fujian province purchasing over 3,000 bags, Zhejiang province purchasing about 2,000 bags, and other provinces making small transactions of 3-500 bags. Zhejiang buyers focused on "Zhongguan Jijing" rice, while Fujian buyers focused on brown rice. The appetite in this district was not strong, and in addition to buying a small amount of "Jixian" rice, 200 bags of old "Xiao Jiao" rice were also traded at a price of 6.85 yuan, which was three cents higher than the previous market. The prices of other rice types were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Yellow Soybeans Temporarily Unchanged</h3>
<p>The yellow soybean market was temporarily stable yesterday. The continuous demand from the mainland has not been officially sold off, and is therefore mainly speculative. Although the market is tight, demand cannot be linked. There were 200 bags traded yesterday. "Fei He" beans barely maintained their original price of 2.80 yuan, so sentiment was slightly soft. In addition, factories continued to purchase three carloads of "Yingzhou" beans at a price of 2.66 yuan. This district sold two carloads of "Fei He" beans at prices of 2.73 yuan and 7 cents.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Silkworm Disease Found in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Farmers in the Hang-Shao "Linping" area are raising late silkworms this season because the early silkworms hatched unevenly. During the first two sleeps, the weather was sunny and warm, and development was smooth. During the third sleep, the weather was irregular, with sudden rain and cold. In the past two days, heavy rain has continued, causing silkworm farmers to be unable to feed their silkworms with leaves. Silkworms eat wet leaves, causing empty heads and diarrhea. The instructors are currently trying to isolate the affected silkworms. Late silkworms are also slow to eat leaves and spit out black foam. Silkworm farming is later in the four rural villages of "Yuyao," and farmers are uniformly incubating improved varieties. After receiving the silkworm eggs, the instructors pick new, improved mulberry leaves, chop them up, and feed the silkworms. In addition, the weather is good, and development is quite good. The early batches are now finishing their second sleep, and the late batches have been feeding for many days. Unfortunately, in recent days, the weather has been cold, followed by continuous spring rain, resulting in high temperatures, which has caused silkworm disease. The silkworms move sluggishly, their appetite decreases sharply, and some have diarrhea with yellow water. Silkworm farmers are removing the diseased silkworms to prevent infection. In "Fuyang," farmers did not feed enough silkworm eggs this season. After hatching, the feeding of young silkworms is supervised by the instructors, and progress has been good. They are now in the middle of their third sleep. In the past two days, there has been more rain than sun, and the weather has been too cold. The temperature is low, and the temperature is high. The silkworms' resistance is weak, and empty heads have been found. Some have diarrhea with black water and stop eating. The current situation is not good. In "Pinghu," the amount of silkworms raised in the four villages is not weak. Local silkworms have been completely abandoned, and only improved varieties are raised. Instructors are also assisting with the raising. After feeding, development has been good. In recent days, there has been continuous spring rain, and the temperature is not high. The young silkworms are weak and slow to eat leaves. Most of the silkworms in their first sleep are stiff on the silkworm rearing tools. The instructors are currently trying to take care of them.</p>
<h3>Number of Tea Shops in Tunxi Increases</h3>
<p>The tea industry in Tunxi has been booming recently. The number of foreign-owned green tea shops has recently increased by 24, bringing the total number of tea shops to 78. Tea shops and tea houses near Tunxi and Yanghu have been fully leased, and the situation is unusually lively. However, the tea gardens in the villages have not yet been harvested because the weather has been cold recently and the tea buds have only slightly emerged. Based on the current situation, new goods will only be available on the market around the beginning of the Summer Solstice.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Land Price Rises by 3 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw customs gold rise by 2054, and the Public Association was very popular. Marked prices for 24 coarse granulated white sugar were 20 yuan and 3 jiao, an increase of 1 jiao and 5 fen, with hundreds of bags traded. No. 9 KNG mark red sugar was quoted at 16 yuan, and Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted at 20 yuan and 6 jiao, but no transactions occurred. Our factory's No. 1 refined white sugar remained at 18 yuan and 6 jiao, with sporadic transactions. Yesterday, Chaoqing sugar from Shantou reported a price increase of 3 jiao in a telegram, due to Qingdao merchants having exhausted their inventory, thus requesting a temporary halt to deliveries in Shanghai. It is said that the firms have already reported tight supplies and are quoting higher prices. Over sixty bags of Leizhou red sand sugar were offered, priced at 13 yuan. White slab sugar from Hong Kong, previously offered at 17 yuan and 8 jiao, recently arrived with an additional 200 plus bags, and samples have been viewed. As customs gold has been rising in recent days, increasing costs, the owners will not release the goods without raising prices.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Dried Lily Flowers Suddenly Rise by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, dried lily flowers have seen tight supplies among firms, and vigorous procurement by both Guangdong and Chaozhou merchants has tightened market quotes. Yesterday, dozens of bags were offered at prices of 17 yuan and 6 jiao, and 18 yuan. Sales prices from merchants have also risen sharply by more than two yuan. A letter from Zhenjiang reported that inventory is less than 200 bags, with total inventory in Shanghai firms also only amounting to eight or nine hundred bags. According to industry insiders, the sales season to Japan is still long, and the new crop is still some time away. If sales from various merchant groups become more active, market prices may potentially rise above 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Orchid Rice: High-Quality Goods Still Scarce - Inferior Quality Still Unpopular</h3>
<p>Previously, the inferior color and quality of the arrived Orchid rice deterred buyers, and sales have not been smooth. Although market quotes have been successively offered, prices have been low. It is said that the highest quality is only priced at 37 or 38 yuan, while inferior quality ranges from 34 or 35 yuan to 32 or 33 yuan. The Taiyuan ship recently arrived with thirteen colors of rice, and samples have been viewed. Unfortunately, it is not top-grade, so there are no buyers yet.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Wire Rises with Tight Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Since the tightening of foreign exchange over the past three or four days, new wire prices have been the first to be impacted and have risen. Prices for various types have increased by 2 or 3 jiao. Although actual transactions are not particularly brisk, market sentiment is quite strong, and prices show no sign of declining. Current market estimates are listed below for reference:</p>
<p>Type　　Current Price　　Exchange Rate Before Decline　　Price Difference</p>
<p>No. 8　　8.25　　7.90　　Rise of 0.35</p>
<p>No. 9　　8.40　　8.10　　Rise of 0.30</p>

<h3>Recent Diplomatic Relations with Japan</h3>
<p>— Gu She</p>
<p>The recent diplomatic relations with Japan represent the most difficult and pressing diplomatic situation China has faced since 1934. Japan seeks to swallow China whole, while Britain and the United States aim for joint and equal partition. The Chinese populace, however, demands anti-imperialism and resistance against Japan. The difficulty lies precisely in this. How will our government cope with this unprecedented crisis to overcome this unprecedented challenge? This warrants close attention.</p>
<p>Japan's ambition to exclusively seize China is not a recent development; it has long been Japan's overall plan for China. Today, this plan is manifested to the highest degree. The military control of North China, the opposition to League of Nations technical cooperation, and the recent statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry have almost entirely exposed Japan's conspiracy against China. Moreover, Japan's recent activities on the international stage and its various threats and coercions against our country further reveal the ruthless nature of this conspiracy. We can only see Japan's diplomatic claws manipulating the entirety of China, while China, pitifully, is too frightened to utter a sound. It seems we must simply comply with whatever it dictates. This situation is unprecedentedly tragic and has opened up an internationally unparalleled disastrous scenario.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the struggle for rights in China among Britain, the United States, and other nations. They all seek to acquire a valuable stake in China, and this asset is currently being contested by various countries, with Japan being particularly ambitious. How to especially obtain richer resources and more advantageous territories in China is what they are anxiously planning day and night. Japan is the true controller of China today, and if Britain and the United States wish to have a share in China, they must first eliminate Japan. Thus, the conflict between the European and American powers and Japan in China becomes more intense. The United States, in particular, stands in the most acute adversarial position against Japan. This has created the tense situation in the Far East since the September 18th Incident. In this struggle, the one being trampled upon to the greatest extent is our pitiful China.</p>
<p>International tensions are intensifying day by day. The crisis of China's partition is escalating, sharpening, and intensifying with each passing day. What is the way out for China in this perilous situation?</p>
<p>According to Premier Wang's recent report, our country's diplomatic policy will not change, and we will not yield to Japan. This is certainly correct, and we earnestly hope that the government authorities can adhere to this. "Better to be a shattered jade than a whole tile" should be the attitude adopted by our government at this moment. Otherwise, succumbing to Japan's threats would truly plunge the entire Chinese nation into an abyss of no return.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we place boundless hope in the general populace of China. I unconditionally believe that only the Chinese people, only the power of the general populace of China, can overcome such a difficult challenge. Do not be pessimistic; the power of our people will one day achieve the restoration of our Chinese nation. What is there to fear from the grasp of the terrible claws of international imperialism? Ultimately, victory will still be ours. Imperialism under financial capitalism will one day collapse, and currently, the foundation of this financial capitalism has already crumbled to an irreparable extent. Our victory lies in watching them dismantle their own stage.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Getting Along in the World</h3>
<p>— Yi Lu</p>
<p>"Listen widely, but reserve your doubts; speak cautiously about the rest, and you will have few reproaches. See widely, but reserve your judgment; act cautiously about the rest, and you will have few regrets. If your words bring few reproaches and your actions bring few regrets, official position will be in them." The commentary in "New Interpretations of the Analects" (see The Analects, Issue 35) says this is a passive pursuit of officialdom. Wen Zhengyi explains it as "Eat more, speak less, and naturally you will have food to eat." True words indeed! However, Confucius saw the difficulty of being human and, by answering Zizhang's question about seeking an official position, elaborated on the deeper meaning of teaching people to have cultivation—or rather self-cultivation. One should not simply bury this meaning. Confucius often used the technique of answering something other than the question, such as "Being filial, being fraternal, and exercising these qualities in government. This, too, is to take part in government. What else is required to take part in government?" This has the same subtle effect as his earlier words to Zizhang. Could it be that Confucius was also good at humor?</p>
<p>Confucius was indeed humorous, but not to the highest degree. The "rest" that is spoken about is still some kind of view that has been suppressed within one's heart, or an obstinately held notion. Even after the cultivation of "listening widely" and "seeing widely," there is the possibility of holding on more firmly to such views. Moreover, this kind of prejudice is, without a doubt, different from, or at least not in agreement with, others' views. Once it is spoken or acted upon, it will displease people, or at least offend someone in a certain situation. One must know that making people unhappy with one's words and actions is detrimental to oneself; harming others is no different from suicide! Therefore, Confucius's meaning of "speak cautiously about the rest" and "act cautiously about the rest" still approves of people saying and doing what they wish with the "rest," as long as they are careful. However, how could Confucius have known that there would be the danger of being unable to speak or act? Therefore, Confucius's words are still somewhat straightforward, and it is always a pity that he did not say to Zizhang: "Do not speak the rest, then you will have no reproaches; do not act the rest, then you will have no regrets. Without reproaches and regrets, official position will be in them." It is a regret that has lasted through the ages!</p>
<p>In this era, speaking and acting is extremely difficult. If one does not speak or act, how can one make a living? Of course, that is impossible. Even something like "Eat more, speak less, and naturally you will have food to eat" only means one has food to eat. Wouldn't that turn one into a manure-producing machine? Therefore, in addition to eating more, one must also "speak" more and "act" more. However, when "speaking" and "acting," one must completely discard the "rest" of "speak cautiously about the rest" and "act cautiously about the rest" and open up a new path. As for the magic of "opening up a new path," it is very simple: one must suppress one's inherent emotions, preventing them from having any possibility of activity. One must listen to the commands of "reason" in both speech and action—to put it bluntly, for the sake of convenience in getting along in the world, one must painfully put one's "conscience" on a high shelf and not let it appear and make trouble.</p>
<p>Thus, the words spoken are not what one originally intended to say, so they will not offend people. The actions taken are not what one originally intended to do, so they will not clash with people. In this way, people will be happy, will welcome you, will profit from you, and will admire you. With welcome and admiration, the speaker and actor will not only "have food to eat," but also enjoy increasing prestige, and endless wealth, wives, and children! Benefiting others is a small matter, benefiting oneself is a great matter; what use is a conscience that is wet and muddled? And it is clear that "speak cautiously about the rest" and "act cautiously about the rest" are not what one should emulate in getting along in the world today. Alas!</p>

<h3>One Night in the Hospital</h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>The sun has gathered its radiance and quietly disappeared below the western horizon. The simple furnishings in the sickroom are already difficult to see clearly. Magu, supporting her ailing body, barely sits up in bed and reaches for the light cord hanging by the bed! She lets the deep blue light emit a dim, gray-white glow. "Why hasn't he come back yet?" Magu mutters to herself, frowning, feeling as anxious and distressed as an ant walking on a hot pan. At the same time, unable to bear the knife-like pain in her stomach, she finally burrows back into the covers.</p>
<p>The air in the room is deathly silent. The dim light shines on her waxy yellow face and her sunken eyes, which resemble hollows, making her look particularly haggard.</p>
<p>Magu's only comfort in the lonely sickroom is a rubber doll about three inches tall. She doesn't know when she developed such an interest and fondness for children. Even she herself feels somewhat bewildered when she thinks about it. However, when a myriad of emotions, misery, and loneliness surge into her heart, she must take this small doll from under her white pillow and caress it. But when she looks at this doll wearing a tall red hat, her heart feels as if it is being pricked by thousands of needles.</p>
<p>Whenever the nurse comes in to give her medicine, her heart aches as if she has been bitten by a vicious poisonous snake. Her head immediately swells, and her vision blurs. The world seems to be spinning for ages.</p>
<p>"Why am I doing this irresponsible and inhumane thing?" She asks herself in pain, with her eyes tightly closed. She feels a tingling in her nose, and pearl-like tears stream down from the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for economic difficulties and the inability to solve the problem of livelihood, who would be willing to destroy her little life! Therefore, this responsibility should be attributed to the flaws in the current social structure." When she is so grief-stricken that she can no longer bear it, she finally shakes her head a few times, consoling herself in this way.</p>
<p>The sound of leather shoes on the stairs, "clop clop," rings out. She thinks, "Maybe Qingping is back." Then, the door opens, and Qingping quietly shrinks her head as she enters.</p>
<p>"Qingping, are you cold? Is it windy outside?" Magu feels that Qingping's hands are ice cold, as if her blood has congealed.</p>
<p>"Yes. It might even rain," Qingping walks to the table and moves her backside onto the orange, propping up her disheveled head with both hands, deep in thought.</p>
<p>The air in the room becomes even more stifling, surrounded by the cold wind.</p>
<p>"Gu, does your stomach still hurt? Did you sleep well this afternoon?" Qingping finally raises her head and asks, breaking the silence, her eyebrows furrowed, and her forehead creased like the streetcar tracks at an intersection.</p>
<p>"My stomach still hurts in waves. According to the doctor..." "The temperature is already the same as a normal person, and I can be discharged tomorrow," Magu says slowly. "Ping, did you find any friends? How about the money..." "It's really unlucky. I went to several places in a row, but I was met with rejection!" Qingping's head droops even lower. "Then, what will we do tomorrow? Ping, I really regret it. I shouldn't have listened to you and come to this place. It's ruined us both..." Magu's throat feels as if it's been blocked by bread. Her sunken eyes become moist, and tears drip onto the plain white pillow.</p>
<p>"What else can we do, with a life like ours?"</p>
<p>The whistling cold wind carries bursts of drizzle, hitting the glass windows with a dripping sound, as if sighing for this pair of young people who have secretly suffered...</p>

<h3>A'ren</h3>
<p>It was a spring day. In the dim light, I watched A'huang, the hardworking maidservant of a household, she was rolling down her familiar _____.</p>
<p>Recently, she had been unemployed again. Her life must have been bitter enough! At the age of fifteen, she became a child bride, living under the abuse of her strict in-laws for seven years. After that, the goddess of fate played a trick on her. Her husband passed away, leaving behind white-haired in-laws and crying children. Thus, relying on her strong body, she maintained the lives of several family members. However, two years later, her beloved children died prematurely, and her in-laws passed away one after another. In this vast world, only she, this lonely and pitiful person, drifted to the ends of the earth, and no one was willing to ask about anything concerning her.</p>
<p>She spent several years in lonely life, swallowing her tears. Because of the whips of life and the shackles of morality, she was ultimately subjected to cruel abuse by her master and lived in inhuman circumstances!</p>
<p>Recently, she was fired again. Unable to withstand the heavy exploitation of the broker, she could only temporarily stay with a familiar and relatively kind former master. It was on a spring evening that she hurriedly came to tell us about her day's results after searching for a job for a day: "Ah! I ran around all day today, without even eating a meal, only eating a few pancakes to make do. Ah! People like me can be considered to have reached the absolute limit of suffering. If I don't go and find a job myself, to be honest, no one would even know if I starved to death. Foxes have dens, and birds have nests, but what about me! I have nothing, only a vagrant drifting to the ends of the earth. Today, I got two pieces of news. One is that A'zhang told me that her neighbor, Mrs. So-and-so, has a family of four, with a monthly salary of five yuan, but I heard that this is a substitute job, and I won't hear back until tomorrow night; and another is that XX Restaurant is recruiting ten female hostesses, so I have already agreed and asked someone to register for me..."</p>
<p>"What? Go be a female hostess? Then you might as well just go and prostitute yourself. If you do that, all the reputation you have gained from five or six years of chastity will be lost! Old Huang! Make up your mind. It's better to be poor than to do such a base thing." The mother of the Zhou family next door heard A'huang say that she wanted to be a female hostess and was so anxious that she interrupted her and launched into a tirade.</p>
<p>A'huang hurriedly protested: "Oh! Old Mrs. Zhou's opinion is good, but this—being a female hostess is also a profession. As long as I am clean and love myself, what does it matter! As for reputation, I have been trapped by this bloodless shackle for years, and now I have realized that I dare not trust it anymore. It will make me hungry and cold. Oh! All kinds of shackles! They are too harsh on us poor people, and they will deprive me of my right to survival..." She was so grief-stricken that tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Being a female hostess is a profession, and no one can deny that. As for 'moonlighting', that is a personal matter, and what does it have to do with the profession? After all, it is a profession that can earn a living, which is better than starving to death. Morality only places people in a desperate situation and does not provide a way for people to survive..." I said sympathetically to A'huang from the side.</p>
<h3>Learning Sound Studies</h3>
<p>— Gu Sui</p>
<p>On the sixth day after I posted more than a dozen advertisements for violin students, which were just like rental advertisements, I received a strange guest, whom I describe as follows:</p>
<p>A pale, miserable face, long hair, supported by a disheveled and dirty outfit, and an attitude that was also somewhat strange, suddenly speaking with a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Are you the one who teaches violin, sir?"</p>
<p>I nodded slightly.</p>
<p>"May I ask you to play a piece, a piece of "Zigeunerweisen" (a famous violin piece)?" His gaze moved from my head down to my worn-out shoes and lingered on a corner of the floor. His eyes were somewhat sinister.</p>
<p>Such a request, coming from an unfamiliar and unpleasant mouth, I would usually sternly reject; but at that time, I was so poor that I had been without food for a day, and I had received the second landlord's third warning to pay the overdue rent within a week. I hoped that he was sent by his master to investigate, having listened to "Zigeunerweisen" beforehand, to first ______ the teacher, and then send the student over. If ______ was right, sending one student, and then the student introducing another student, two, three... then my current difficulty could be solved.</p>
<p>It was this hope that gave me the strength to tune the violin and play that sad "Zigeunerweisen."</p>
<p>The bow moved across the four strings, making me temporarily forget my current difficult situation. Note by note, the sounds crossed my face and drilled into my eardrums, each one more poignant than the last. In this melancholy rhythm, I happily discovered that a piano accompaniment had joined in. Harmonious, in sync, I temporarily stopped bowing to find the source of the accompaniment. Ah, it was the strange guest standing in front of me, humming with his head raised, the harmonious sounds flowing from his throat.</p>
<p>He hummed like this until the end of the piece. I stopped bowing and found tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>"In this day and age, musicians are destined to starve to death!"</p>
<p>He said, taking a light breath, his gaze falling outside the window.</p>
<p>These words pierced my heart.</p>
<p>"Does sir also play the violin?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, I can't play. My woman, she plays very well; I only know how to play the piano."</p>
<p>"Now—"</p>
<p>"Now my woman is in heaven, because she was poor and couldn't afford medicine."</p>
<p>"This is the fault of the social structure—" I was somewhat saddened, and just as I was about to complain, he spoke again. "Let the devil curse music records, Movietone, radio, the general public's appreciation has shifted away from us."</p>
<p>A moment of silence, emptiness grabbing at our hearts. "Play "Zigeunerweisen" once more, I beg you, sir, to give me a chance to remember my woman again."</p>
<p>Blankly, I picked up the violin, and a melancholy rhythm filled the small room once more.</p>
<p>At the end of the piece, I laid down the violin weakly. I didn't know when this strange guest had left without saying goodbye.</p>
<h3>Displaying Machinations</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>In everyday life, we can hear the phrase "So-and-so is best at displaying machinations" almost anytime and anywhere. At first, listening to it seems baffling. In fact, in this day and age, this phenomenon has almost become a fashion. The so-called display of machinations does not have any profound philosophy. Simply put, it is the art of getting along with people, but it is not easy to refine this art to the point of perfection and apply it seamlessly. Rather, it must be achieved through effort. At the same time, this art resides within the individual. With a particular person, there is a unique ingenuity that is not something that all adults can learn. Although everyone wants to be able to do so, things in the world are often unfamiliar at first, then familiar after practice, and then wise after being fooled once or twice. The question is whether one is skilled enough and has put in enough effort. Those who are skilled enough can find a way through any obstacle, and can find success in any situation. Those who are not skilled enough will not only be thwarted at every turn, finding no gaps to exploit, but will also easily be despised. Therefore, if you ask yourself whether your ability to display machinations—the art of getting along with people—is not yet well-honed, then it is better to say what you mean and do what you should, rather than pretending to be mysterious and revealing your flaws, which would lead to a self-defeating situation. However, today's society is entirely a scene of overt and covert competition, a scene that can simply be described as a scam, full of hypocrisy, cunning, and deceit, where only this kind of person can stand firm, get promoted, and get rich, to the point of becoming a great figure who is praised and celebrated. Conversely, if you are a novice who knows nothing about human affairs, then no matter how noble your virtues or how extensive your learning, it will be of no use. Not only will you be unable to rise in the world, but you will also have to tighten your belt and remain frustrated all your life.</p>
<p>The ancients also said, "Proficiency in human affairs is literature," which truly reveals everything. Moreover, in the snobbish society of today, displaying machinations is precisely the skill of getting along with people, and it is the number one secret to getting along in the world. If you can understand the details and apply them, you will be guaranteed success in everything you do. For example, when interacting with people, you should only say three-tenths of what you know, and not reveal everything. When dealing with matters, you should handle them slowly with an ambiguous attitude, and not cut them off with a single word. Other things, such as watching the wind and trimming the sails, and seizing opportunities, are all part of the art of displaying machinations.</p>
<p>Today, displaying machinations has become a new morality for making a living and establishing oneself. Those who possess it float, and floating means survival; they can also enjoy the blessings of wealth and honor. Those who lose it sink, and sinking means it is difficult to establish a foothold. Therefore, if we want to survive in society, we must have the ability to display machinations. However, the social atmosphere has indeed deteriorated day by day. Alas!</p>
<h3>One Night</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Limitless flames burned in Fei's heart, making him conscious that every cell was constantly fluctuating. The room was quiet, with only the ticking sound of the small glass clock on the table breaking the silence. The setting sun peeked out from a wisp of flowing clouds, and the shadows of the trees in the courtyard slanted across the window and onto the walls of the room. How gentle the spring air!</p>
<p>Facing the mirror, Fei took off the tie he had just tied—</p>
<p>—It's really absurd, it just won't stand up! He repeatedly knotted it.</p>
<p>After putting on his coat and applying some flesh-colored powder, he looked in the mirror. What a beautiful face! He smiled, revealing two rows of neat teeth in his bright red lips, sparkling with cleanliness.</p>
<p>He began to walk, his footsteps playing a harmonious melody on the floor.</p>
<p>—Why hasn't she come yet? Xin is so slow. It's been half an hour already! Impatiently, he looked at the clock on the table. Smoke puffed from his mouth, a swirling mist, like a string of small beads, growing larger and then disappearing.</p>
<p>The afterglow quickly faded, and the courtyard and room were bathed in a layer of ambiguity. When the two of them walked together, past the neat wintergreens, and out of the school gate, the torches on the street were all lit.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly, they walked along the mysterious streets, where no traces of wartime damage could be seen.</p>
<p>A slender figure flashed by like a breeze—Ohlhowbigthebattookl. He followed, laughing, excited, an irresistible temptation seizing his heart.</p>
<p>How alluring, a plump ham, no, not just the thighs, but above the thighs all the way to the shoulders, were so alluring. His heart itched, his face felt hot, and it felt like a fire was burning in his stomach!</p>
<p>Supporting his burning heart, he rushed in, full of infinite expectations, and sat down. The lights went out, and scenes flashed before his eyes, flowing like waves, passing by. The film seemed a bit heavy, and his body was particularly awkward. Disappointment occupied his entire heart. He came out and went to Moon Palace, which was emitting a dim light, melting onto everyone's faces, eerie. How delicate the rhythm under his feet, crisp? Humph, an old man's sigh!</p>
<p>Here, time is not allowed to be "precious," there is only anticipation.</p>
<p>When leaving Moon Palace, the spring breeze was blowing, lightly, softly, a gentle breath rippling.</p>
<p>—Well, it's getting late, better find Xiao Chen! Go to Da Dong.</p>
<p>Joy enveloped Fei's heartstrings. The next day, in Fei's diary, were these few lines:</p>
<p>Indulge, good night,</p>
<p>Don't wait for tomorrow;</p>
<p>But, how foolish I am!</p>
<p>I didn't even suckle her lips!</p>
<p>···········</p>
<p>Indulge, good night,</p>
<p>Don't wait for tomorrow;</p>
<p>Oh, how unbearable for me!</p>
<p>That flesh makes my heart flutter.</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>Indulge, good night,</p>
<p>Don't wait for tomorrow,</p>
<p>Ah, how happy I am!</p>
<p>Receiving her light caresses, faint smiles.</p>

<h3>A Woman's Heart</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cen</p>
<p>My friend, she once suddenly said to me in my room:</p>
<p>"Come, come, gently close the door!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter that requires closing the door?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I want to tell you something that can't be said without closing the door!"</p>
<p>I really closed the door tightly as she wanted. She shyly pulled me with her hand, pushed me onto the bed, and then lifted the blanket to cover my head. I was shocked by her at the time and didn't know what was going on. She also tightly wrapped her arms around my neck and put her face down close to mine before starting to say, "I want to tell you... I want to... tell you." She never managed to say what she wanted to tell me. I was about to suffocate from the blanket she put on me, and I really wanted to get angry. But out of curiosity, I asked her what she wanted to say to me. She said, "Um... um, I want to discuss something with you, I'm really suffering! They all love me, and they want my final answer. I don't know who to love!"</p>
<p>I said, "Love the one you love a little more, what's so difficult about that?"</p>
<p>"Each has their own loveliness. What do you want me to do? You know! One is a university graduate, now the director of studies at a certain middle school. He has great ideas and writes beautiful articles, but he has a face full of beard. He's also my nephew, although he's older than me. He's loved me since childhood. I think if I reject his love, he'll really commit suicide. If I accept his love, then we have to abandon our families. At that time, think how sad my mother would be? And what would happen to my father and my own reputation? What would our life be like after running away from our families? Could I withstand the pressure of hunger and cold? All these questions are swirling in my mind."</p>
<p>"There's also another one, he's very young and handsome, and his family is very wealthy, but his knowledge is very shallow and he's very romantic. He even has affairs with his own father's concubine. However, because of the school's situation, I live in his house to avoid conflicts with others. Once, when his sister and I came back from buying things outside, he always waited at home. When he heard the sound of knocking on the door, he would not only open the door for us himself but also take the things from our hands and linger by my side. See how lovely he is!"</p>
<p>In the end, she was afraid of hardship and admired wealth. Not long after, she married this son of wealth in Shanghai. When I bumped into her, she invited me to play in the park. Her tone was already different from before, and she said very depressingly, "Before we got married, he served me so well, but now he wants me to get his slippers for him every day. Also, his uncle's wife is always showing her displeasure, saying I'm a free woman, which is really unbearable. I want to come out and teach and find a job for myself, but they won't let me. The nephew I told you about before has now become famous in the Chinese literary world, you see!"</p>
<p>"Friend! Are you regretting it in your heart?" I said. "Get out! Who told you I regret it? Who wants to marry that bearded guy?" She suddenly got angry at me. I really didn't expect her to rebuke me with such a new reason. After returning home, I naturally couldn't forget the humiliation I had suffered, but I still had to understand her with a silent attitude. Her heart was indeed in pain. She didn't want her friends to know that she was repenting. She revealed the accumulation of depression in her heart, hoping that her friends would not understand her self-description when she spoke. From this, it can be seen that her marrying the wealthy young master at that time was entirely out of vanity, admiring money and beauty. Not marrying her nephew was due to the constraints of feudal ideology. Today's pain and self-regret are because she is essentially a university student. She has new ideals. She can't bear the oppression of the old family and the pain of being controlled by money. A woman who grew up in a feudal society and was educated in a capitalist society, although she understands her own suffering, cannot get rid of the vanity of her own class, so she has to throw a temper tantrum at her friends to cover it up. Finally, I dare say that a woman's heart has class characteristics. Her psychology is entirely formed by the social environment. In a certain class, there is a certain kind of woman's heart, especially in two different societies, a woman's heart cannot be discussed consistently.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow (4)</h3>
<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>At the same time, I received the school's opening notice and Sister Yun's letter.</p>
<p>This semester I got several more distinctions, and when school starts, Principal Hu will surely stroke my hair and praise me a few words, which is really something to be happy about. I eagerly ran to tell Mom, but she didn't seem to hear and just continued doing her own thing. I tugged at her, and she said, "Aying, don't go to school in the second half of the year. Your in-laws have already chosen a date, so hurry up and do some needlework at home." I stared at Mom's face for a while, because she liked to joke, but today it didn't seem like a joke. I don't know what sad thing I thought of and ran to the room and cried on the bed.</p>
<p>My heart was really like a bundle of tangled hemp. I thought of how I couldn't study anymore, I couldn't be with Sister Yun often anymore, and I had to leave my Mom. At the same time, I thought of him—the man who was going to be my husband—whom I had never met. What would he look like? And I naturally thought of him, didn't Mom say that it would be good to have a son-in-law like him, so why didn't she marry me to him, but to a man I didn't know? That lovely and terrible dream swirled in my heart like a spinning wheel. I can't marry a man I don't love as a husband. I wonder if he knew this news or not. Why hasn't he come for so many days? Did he know I was getting married...? I cried so hard that I couldn't catch my breath. My Mom loves me so much, how can she bear to send her daughter to a place she knows nothing about?</p>
<p>It seemed like there was a shadow behind me, and sure enough, he had patted my shoulder. It was Mom's voice, saying so softly, "Aying, after your Dad died, I raised you to be so big, of course I can't bear to let you leave. But, child, girls always have to go to their in-laws' house when they grow up. You can still come back often, it's not like you're still at home, and having one more person also makes me happy. Don't you see how happy your older sister is after she got married? She's about to have a baby now. Hurry, child, don't cry, crying makes Mom's heart ache too, Aying!" Mom picked me up, patted me, and used a handkerchief to wipe away my tears. "Aying, Mom can't bear to part with you either!" She held me in her arms like she was holding a child. Mom loves me, but I can't say a word to her face. What should I say to Mom?</p>
