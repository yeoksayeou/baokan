<h3 id="c24">哈蒲斯堡復辟問題　廷 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>日前盛傳奧總統米克拉斯。將於今秋辭職。繼任者非歐根大公。卽爲副總理史泰亨堡親王。此事而果實現。則哈蒲斯堡王朝之復辟問題。必將重行引起歐洲各國之嚴重注意。甚或造成希特勒主義與奧匃正統主義之對壘局面。亦未可知。</p>
<p>哈蒲斯堡之於中歐。不僅爲一普通之王室。且爲一根深蒂固之組織。其所操縱之政權。雖因上屆大戰。而至於完全消滅。而其組織之潛能。則依然存在。最近且有日益滋蔓之勢。吾人或能記憶。哈蒲斯堡最後之皇帝卡爾。雖嘗有不再參予奧匃兩國政務之聲明。而終其一生。迄未宣布實行下野。卡爾死後。其長子沃都大公。經其母氏齊太之長期訓迪。久在靜待時機。以求其所大欲。</p>
<p>當陶爾斐斯執政時代。奧國排斥國社黨與社會民主黨之運動。可謂不遺餘力。然陶氏之大政方針。動多偏於消極方面。而殊無何種使人興奮之標榜物。可以阻遏希特勒主義之入侵。有之。則沃都耳。在陶氏之意。沃都之復辟運動。苟能利用得當。未始不可一新奧人之耳目。而喚起國民部分之同情。卽其本人以篤信天主敎義及富於復辟思想故。亦頗願見帝政之重現。其所以未敢率爾主張。徒因格於外交形勢。雅不欲太形露骨。以引起國際之糾紛耳。陶氏旣死。正統派首領許士尼格及史泰亨堡親王繼任正副總理之職。二人素表同情於復辟。至是乃得相機實行其懷抱。是以近數月來。沃都回國之說。愈傳愈眞。其爲實行復辟之先聲。固無疑也。</p>
<p>且按諸事實。奧國新頒佈之憲法。關於國家正式名稱之條文中。業經删去「民國」字樣。卽前經列入憲法之取締哈蒲斯堡王室之規定。亦不再見。故沃都回國。巳無背於奧國之法律。此其有助於復辟運動之前途。自可以不言而喻且卽就外交上言。在聖日耳曼條約中。固未嘗提及哈蒲斯堡之名稱。惟一九二○年二月四日。與一九二一年四月一日之各國大使會議。曾兩次照會奧匃政府。謂哈蒲斯堡王室之復辟爲同盟國之所堅决反對而巳。而奧國之復辟派。則仍謂大使會議之聲明。惟匈牙利曾予以正式之承認。故祗能束縛匃牙利之行動。而不能束縛奧國云。</p>
<p>意大利與小恊商國之態度。最與哈蒲斯堡復辟問題有關。凡稍明國際情勢者。類能道之。墨索里尼對此問題。故作鎭靜。以自示其淡泊。實則未嘗有一日去諸懷。邇來報章頻傳。沃都大公行將與意郡主瑪麗亞締婚。以爲促進意奧關係之一助。人言藉藉。未始無幾分之可能性。惟意國政策。當視法之態度而轉移。而巴黎政府則尙在歧路徘徊之中。蓋藉哈蒲斯堡之緩衝。以反抗希特勒勢力之膨脹。自爲法人所樂聞。但如明目張膽以贊助沃都之復辟。則復不免有出賣小恊商國之嫌。此其所以不能不特加審愼耳。</p>
<p>小恊商國之所以反對沃都復辟。理由至爲單純。一言以蔽之。蓋恐復辟吿成後。中歐有一天主敎之君主國出。將因宗敎關係而引起捷克之斯洛伐克人。南斯拉夫之克羅西亞人。及羅馬尼亞之屈冷斯佛尼亞人之反叛運動。以與奧國相合併耳。其反對也固宜。然今日小恊商國之反奧精神。似已不如一九二一年時之熱烈。如沃都而竟有復辟之一日。捷克等國其果將實行興師伐罪。以引起慘酷之戰禍耶。殊未敢逆料其必然。</p>
<p>奧國之情形如是。而匃牙利則頗有所出入。一則因匃政府曾於一九二一年十一月十日。正式承認兩次大使會議之决議。以反對哈蒲斯堡復辟爲巳任。且於一九二二年加入國聯之時。重復承認此點之國際義務。以自示其無他。再則因現任攝政霍賽與總理貢波斯二人。與齊太沃都皆有甚深之宿𨻶。自未足以言和衷共濟也。</p>
<p>惟吾人有須注意者。在匃牙利之現行法律中。並未有繼任攝政應歸何人之規定。現任攝政霍賽。年巳六十有六。風燭殘年。來日無多。一旦謝世。惟國聯行政院有監視其繼任問題之權。屆時國聯行政院對於沃都在匃復辟。究將採取如何態度。殊不可必。惟就現狀而論。則哈蒲斯堡在奧活動之可能性。實較多於在匃活動耳。</p>

<p>汪院長訓詞云、主席、各位同志、今天八時行政院開會、一直開到現在才散會、所以兄弟來得遲這是要向各位抱歉的、前兩天在此地、曾開過郵政會議、在郵政會議開會的那天、兄弟曾到這裏來說過幾句話、同時看見許多郵政界的負責長官、集合在一堂、今天是電政會議、又見許多電政界的負責長官集合一堂、這是兄弟感到無限欣喜的、同時也以對於郵政會議的熱望、同樣希望於電政會議、在前幾天開郵政會議的那天、兄弟曾經說過、國難以來、各種建設事業、在困難中力求進展、而且較有成績的、要算交通和鐵道兩部、郵政和電政是交通部所屬的重要的國營事業、也都經過在種種困難中奮鬥、郵政上所受到的損害、電政上也同樣的受到、郵政上所感到的困苦、電政上也同樣的感到、這兩種重要的國營事業、同在困難之下、同在受極大損害之下、於國難及其他天災人禍之中、靠朱部長和各位負責人員的努力和奮鬥、才有現在的成績、電政是很專門的一種事業、兄弟缺乏這種專門的知識、沒有什麽可以貢獻、不過有幾句很普通、很簡單的話、向各位說一說、我們都知道、電政自民國以來、沒有多大發展、其所以不發達的原因、是經濟不足、而經濟不足的原因、是營業不良、交通部有鑒於此、因此求經濟上的合理進步、採用現金集中制度、現在電政經濟狀况、較諸從前、巳有很大的進步、而在其他制度方面、由朱部長及各位的努力、也改進不少、電政事業是一種國營事業、詳言之、是國營的一種商業、不過電政事業、常受到一種阻礙和壓迫、就是軍政機關的摧殘、使電政不能够完全發展、我想這一點、必是電政會議要討論的一個重要問題、兄弟覺得關於這個問題、交通部必定儘量設法、其他各機關必能儀量帮助、兄弟力量所及、必願盡量和各位合作、使各位在這次會議中、所貢獻的意見、見諸實現、本來電政事業是很可以發達的一種事業、但自民國以來、所以不能十分發逹的原因、就是受軍事政治上的影響、從前電政曾經成爲軍閥割據的一種事業、使整個的事業、成爲零零碎碎的事業、可以發逹的事業、成爲衰敗不堪的事業、而電政前途、因此受到很大的影響和打擊、這都是軍政機關、不明白電政事業是營業性的原故、其次、自從無綫電發明之後、有綫電與無綫電之間、發生了一個很大的問題、我們都知道、馬可尼發明的無綫電、是交通上一種很重大的貢獻、但是有綫電與無綫電之間、似成了一種對立的狀况、似乎有綫電與無綫電有不能相容的情態、其實有綫電與無綫電、各有各的用處、各有各的地位、舉個例來說、這次黄專使慕松到西藏去、自四川到西藏、一路都是高山峻嶺、有綫電當然不通、因有無綫電收發機隨帶、一路能隨時給我們通消息、隨時給我們有系統的報吿、否則到這個時候、我們必一點得不到消息、因此我們可以知道無綫電、可以補有綫電的不足、不過無綫電的情况、現在非常混亂、各省各機關、現在都自設電臺、租界内也有私設電臺、對於這種紊亂的制度、我們也應設法加以整頓和改良、使有綫電和無綫電都能有系統的發展、這或者也是本次會議中要討論的一個重要問題、這次的電政會議、各位提出了許多的議案、兄弟相信在這次會議之後、一方面將各位的意見貢獻出來、一方面各位在業務上、所受到的困難、也儘量發表出來、這樣不光是交通部可以採納各位的意見、分别施行、同時各位所受的困難、也因此可以設法解除、我們都知道電政上所受到的最大困難、就是軍政機關的强加壓迫、如民國以來、時常可以看到軍政要人的通電、往往要長至一二千字、而且這一二千字、不是緊要字句、乃是四六駢文、這種情形、實呌報務員受很大的寃苦、本來長文的電報、並不是必不可發、但必須是因爲要說明一件事的原委、出於不得已、但仍應把擬好的稿、加以修改、使文字省至不可再省、簡至不可再簡、這不但爲顧到報務員打電報時的困難、同時尤其是爲國家省用費、兄弟以爲如果各軍政機關都能想到這一點、對電政的營業收入、必大有可觀兄弟覺得、而且時常說的、有兩句話、一、軍隊國防化、二、國營事業商業化、軍隊如果能成爲國家的武力、國防的利器、這才是眞正的軍隊、國營事業能够商業化、才是成爲眞正的生產事業、一種國營的事業、是國家的命脈、民族的生命、所以國營事業有損失、也就是國家民族的損失、所以這種事業、必須使他成爲統一的事業完全國營的事業、而且是商業化的事業、以後這種營業、要就營業的規矩做去、從前電政上往往可以受到一種莫明其妙的損失、苦心孤詣的建設、又各受一陣狂風暴雨的摧毁、使得負責的主管人員、感到失望、使熱心的辦事人員、覺得掃興、這種種失望和掃興、諒必在這一次會議中、必儘量報吿出來、軍政機關的破壞、應使他們明白、對於國營事業之損害、亦即損害他們自己的利益、所以應該通力合作、行政院方面、當然儘力來帮助、現在電政上的毛病、外來的壓迫、希望不要顧慮的說出來、大家以大無畏的精神、說出所感受的痛苦、並以大無畏的精神、改革過去的錯誤、盼望各位誠心誠意的說出來、大家誠心誠意的來改革、（五日）</p>

<p>有獎儲蓄　「主席·諸位先生、兄弟今日得有機會來此講演、甚以爲榮、此次中國經濟學會第十一屆年會在長沙舉行、兄弟在湘目覩該省一切情形、覺得大有希望、只是資本缺乏、爲湘省之最大問題、然此乃整個的中國經濟問題、初不僅湘省如此、中國現有的資本、多集中于上海·廣州·天津·杭州·靑島·漢口·等九大都市、而尤以上海爲甚、現在上海約存有四萬萬之鈔票、五萬萬之現銀、二十一萬萬之存欵、影響所及、上海患膨脹病而内地則患貧血症、上海銀行界近來因中國實業界之衰落、與工廠管理法之衙門化與大家庭化、不敢再向工廠投資、又不能再以其資本作買賣公債地皮標金之投機生意、因此種投機、必在金價暴漲暴落之時、方可獲利、今公債價値穏定、此種投機當不可行、又不能以其資本收買地皮、因上海地皮價値、日在低落之中、于是有資本者乃以其所擁有之資金轉向美國作買賣之投機事業、今滬上有六大家專做此種生意、每値晚間、電燈輝、電話　通、營業甚爲發達、去年一年中、其所獲之和、達五千萬之多、但此種投機、危險性大、今日不幸或可損失五萬萬元之鉅欵、美國損失五萬萬不算什麽、中國損失五萬萬、則將陷財政于絶境、且資本集中上海、則内地虛無、農村貧困、我國爲入超國家每年不能不將現銀出口、于是内地金融必日益枯竭、將來第二次大戰發生、敵人以其砲火熱力威脅上海、不准動用各銀行鈔票之凖備金、已足使我們各個人所有之鈔票變成廢紙、如我加以抵抗、則經濟中心的上海、不難一旦毁敗于砲火之中、使我後方恐慌、無法維持、故現銀之集中上海、實是眞有莫大之危險性、而現銀之所以集中滬濱、亦由萬國儲蓄會及中法儲蓄會之有奬儲蓄、以此爲其最大之原因、至于有奬儲蓄之騙取人民金錢、那又是次要的另一間題、總理之遺敎、在利用外資以發展國内之工商業、而儲蓄會則反其道而行、利用我内資以助長外資之勢力、以我人民之金錢、送給外人、到滬租界上去建築洋房、現在萬國儲蓄會之儲蓄辦法、分三元·六元·十二元·等項之分月儲蓄、最多的每月十二元、須繳欵十四年、一月不繳、就失其得奬之權利、且無所謂利息、每月繳欵十二元、到十四年之後、無論存入那一個銀行、可得本利四千八百三十一元、而儲蓄會則僅得二千元、相差二千八百餘元之鉅、儲蓄會于此二千八百餘元之中、約以一千元作奬、其餘的則被其剝削了、此其一、儲蓄會之抽籤給奬、在上海舉行、旣無監察委員會等名稱之監察機關之組織、儲户又難于過問、個中眞相如何、究令人莫知底藴、此又其二、然這猶是個人的問題、我們爲整個的中國經濟前途着想、應反對内地資本集中上海、應該以上海的資金分散於農村、資本流入農村、則農民購買力强大、都市工商業發達、農村經濟繁榮、則敵人之飛機大砲雖能威脅或毁壞我少數的部市、但不　能控制我整個的農村、此爲兄弟反對有狀儲蓄之理由、</p>
<p>白銀問題　至于白銀問題、與有奬儲蓄、有深切的關係、可合爲一整個的問題、我國于各國多用金本位制之中、獨用銀本位制、自美國收白銀爲國有後、銀價日高、影響于我者甚大、在美國未吸收白銀以前、金與銀爲七二與一之比、今美國提高至一六與一之比、其算法如下、一盎斯銀可換一元二角九的紙幣、但鑄造費要百分之五十、故變成六毛四分五紙幣、以一半作其鑄造費、但紙幣有市價、六毛四分五之紙幣、値六毛九分的金子、即一盎斯的銀子、得三毛九的金子、結果金與銀變成五一與一之比了、即一盎斯銀僅値三毛九的金子、此種現象形成、有近因與遠因二種原因、而近因又可分爲三、即（一）美國現在民主黨執政、該黨與美之銀礦資本家有密切的關係、故必提高銀價、以助其勢力之膨脹、（二）美國近來物價日趨低落、工廠多已倒閉、故必以銀子替代金子、使金價低落、物價上昇、（三）美國想增加其對我國之出口貨物、與日本在華之經濟勢力相競争、於是提高銀價、使中國人得因此而多買美國之貨物、使美貨得排斥日貨、至於遠的原因有二、據兄弟之推測、美國以爲提高銀價、則中國現銀之存在外國銀行者、必賣歸美國、於是中國現銀缺乏、農村必起恐慌、鈔票必持以兌現、而剩有之現銀、必被收藏、在現銀一方面流出國外、一方面被人收藏之中、結果必至於現銀全無所見、美國乃乘機借我以白銀、有如以前十萬萬元現銀之借欵、以握取我國經濟的命脈、中國所有之現銀、約有二十萬萬之數、存在上海者約五萬萬元之譜、據海關之统計、今年我現銀之出口、巳達一萬三千萬、將來外國銀行之現銀運送國外以後、再向中國的銀行挪用、我因入超的關係、又無法抵制、於是上海的銀行界現銀空虚、必向内地挪用、使中國農村所有之現銀、流入海外、此爲美國人提高銀價以排斥在華日貨之政策、然兄弟以爲事實不可能、蓋日貨之傾銷中國、並不如以前之向中國投資、現在日本以貨易銀、再以銀轉賣美國、以圖其利、且以銀向美國購買原料、如棉花之類、歸日本製造後、又以貨物傾銷中國則以所得之銀賣入美、而爲繼續的同樣的買賣生意、結果、日貨未被美貨打倒、而美國則反受制於日本了、我國一般人對救濟此種危機之方策有二、（一）抽收白銀出口稅、（二）禁止白銀出口、前者之主張者、以爲一經抽稅　、則現銀不至出口、但兄弟不以爲然、因爲美國吸收白銀、以提高銀價、是慢慢的進行、不是陡然的使銀價提高、如我抽稅、一則外國銀行之現銀先行出口、集於無稅之香港、我係抽百分之三時、此現銀就運出到香港、到我抽稅至百分之十五時、則集於香港之銀必轉入於美國、可賺百分之十二的銀稅的利息、是以出口稅無用、至於禁止出口、也非辦法、因爲中國是入超的國家、斷不能不將銀出口、如果買金子以還償、則金價已漲、必不合算、至於最好的辦法、兄弟以爲要財政當局以清醒的頭腦、廉潔的行政、集中現銀、發行在法律上不兌現之鈔票、買用外貨、均付之以鈔票、凡衣食住之必需品、均可用國貨代替、至於關於「行」的方面的「飛機」「火車頭」之機器、則不能以鈔票購用、汽油一物、可用酒精代替、若夫衣食住、則外貨之流入中國、不能得現銀以出口、勢必以我國之出產品運歸、以貨易貨、在我可不虞白銀問題之嚴重矣、然此種救濟之方策、與有獎儲蓄、實有密切之關係、美國之白銀政策、與萬國儲蓄會同爲帝國主義對我之經濟侵略、我國如果不取締有獎儲蓄、則今日之萬國儲蓄會、即爲東印度公司第二、而白銀問題、亦將無法解决了、希望各界同胞及黨政當局注意及之、以促政府之注意焉、</p>

<p>在積極方面，婦女在社會上旣尋不到智識的用途在消極方面又有家事的牽累。家事，是束縛一切婦女的鎖鍵，是腐蝕婦女求知慾的主觀的最大原因，許多人認爲婦女是生理底及不上男子的，這並不是事實，婦女的不及男子，乃是家事這一根鐵鍵套上了她們的頸，已經設好了「男子治外女子治内」的圈套以後的事。有了家事牽累，婦女才變成家庭的奴隸，變成了男子的奴隸，變成了除掉生兒養女，服侍丈夫等外再沒有活動可能的家庭傀儡。這種束縛，無論是中國舊時的大家庭，或時髦的一夫一婦的新家庭内都牢固地牽住了婦女。譬如，在新式家庭内，婦女能不生兒女嗎？又能不養育兒女嗎？即使洗衣燒飯可以雇娘姨，然而，指揮料理那些所謂家務，旣輪不到男子，也還生成的是要主家婦自己來的。即退一步說，一切家務可以有人代管，但因爲旣有家事牽累，而家庭觀念，在傳統的支持下，一時又擺脫不了，以致男女的關係也不能不建築在家庭上，以家庭爲男女共同營求的唯一目標，以家庭爲男女給婚後的愛情的維繫，家庭破裂，男女間便一切都完了！這樣，無論男女，非到萬不得已時，决不願破壞家庭的平靜，作爲主家婦的女子，於是就使僅僅吃飯睡覺，也還是只有讓自己的頸套在這一鎖鍵内了。</p>
<p>要女子成爲社會人，是非走出家庭這一狹小的範圍，同時顧到世界不可，我們以爲女子與男子間的關係，應是一種眞忱愛情的結合，而這種愛情又是建築在互助，互相了解以及社會事業的努力上面的。這樣，婦女成了完全的自由人，完全獨立的人，也和男子一樣只有在學業上事業上才能求得她們的生存。試問她們還有什麽男子可做的事不可做呢？她們爲什麽會不努力獲取高深的智識，以爲求生的武器呢？</p>
<p>在中國，家庭制度自然有許多比歐美更大的弊害，且賢淒良母一向是視爲天經地義的。婦女不僅不能成爲社會人，且連以前爭取來的一點進學校，社交公開的權利，現在也有失去的危險。這種現象在目前是隨處可以看到的，像劉君的那位朋友能够拿社會科學的書給他的女人看，以及另一位並希望他的女人能够和他共同研究文學，這樣的事，自然不是少有，但這决不是普遍的情形，許多少年紳士均唯恐他們的妻子抛頭露面踏入社會，甚至等不及她們完成學校的學業，就把她們與社會的接觸一一</p>
<p>切斷了。</p>
<p>所以，婦女結婚後的均不求上進，决不能單怪婦女本身的堕落，實有其主要的客觀的原因存在。如果我們要解决婦女結婚後的自學問题，就不能不從根本解决她們生活的環境與思想間的矛盾着手。</p>
<p>如上面所及樹立婦女的社會地位和獨立的經濟權，以及解放家事，乃是婦女解放的第一要義。乃是婦女在事業上和學問上能够獲得眞正平等自由的主要條件，然而，這關聯着整個社會改革問題，不是一舉手便可成功的，在這裏，只能作爲關心婦女解放，婦女自學問題的人們一個努力的目標。</p>
<p>於是，我們能談到的便只有怎樣才能使她們的生活利於自學的條件了。（未完）</p>

<p>再講到「禮」、西洋人無論在何處都是彬彬有禮譬如在馬路上走路、碰了一碰、外國人是不顧你碰我、或者我碰你、他們都是很客氣的說聲對不起、中國人如果碰了一碰、就會開口相駡、動手相打、毫無禮貌、同時外國人買東西、都是不爭先順次序的一個一個進去、好像小學生排着很整齊的隊伍一樣這些都是他們禮的表現、也是他們社會之所以會有秩序最後講到「信」西洋入的守信精神、在晏會時最可表現、我們中國人則大不然、甚至六點鐘請吃飯、竟會到十點鐘開始的西洋各國就因爲有這四種美德所以他們人民能親愛團結、換言之、他們民族所以能够團結、就是仁義禮信四者去團結他們的而這四種美德、却是我國固有的敎條、近幾年來、我們中國雖然常有團結的呼聲、可是到現今仍是不能團結、這就是因爲吾國固有的仁義禮信的社會道德沒有發揚的緣故、反觀西洋各國仁義禮信的社會道德、却如此發展、所以他們能够團結、能够爲國家爲民族爲社會爲他人去努力去犧牲因此他們的民族就能發生力量、而造成了他們民族的富强、我們應該如何猛省呢、</p>
<p>三、民衆勤奮之精神　西洋各國人民、一般的都很勤儉耐勞、你們不要以爲西洋的物質文明如此發達、就想消費享樂、要知物質文明之眞諦、是創造物質、利用物質、並非享用物質、浪費物質、我們中國現在一般人、大家祇知道享用與浪費物質、而不去創造與利用物質、實在是物質文明的罪人、西洋物質文明、固如此發達、但是他們民衆刻苦耐勞、愛惜物力、創造物質的精神、却遠非吾人所及、這未始不是他們富强之源、我是向來不願意贊揚西洋民族的不過這種精神、確是値得欽佩、他們坐在光華燦爛的環境裏、一般的却都很勤儉、比我們在憂患困苦中更爲勤儉、我在比利時的時候、看到他們人民的生活情形、中人之家、生活頗爲清苦、早餐不過幾片麵包和一杯咖啡、中餐不過一兩樣菜而巳、晚上也和早餐一樣簡單、可是他們做起事來、都是很勤奮、黎明即起不用僕人、一切粗細工作、都自己來幹、我們在國難時期、一般人民、特别是都會裏的人民、仍是不知奮發、日高三尺、尙不起身、羣居終日、言不及義、縱欲消耗、不務正業、甚至倡「跳舞救國」「娛樂救國」之怪論、是將何以謀民族之復興乎希望當局、對於這種頽風、要加以切實的糾正、</p>
<p>其次、講到日本民族之情形、日本民族之發展、也有三個原因、這三個原因、雖與歐美不盡相同、亦屬近似、</p>
<p>一、「日本迷」丨丨日本人的民族意識、好像催眠術似的中了迷一樣、所以稱爲「日本迷」這可分三點來說、</p>
<p>（一）迷信國家他們說日本大帝國是神造的、是世界上頂天立地無比的大帝國、</p>
<p>（二）迷信民族他們說日本民族是神給他們選擇的日本民族是世界上最優秀無比的民族、所以他們不顧死活的拚命愛護他們的民族、甚至明明自己錯了、也還要同人家拚命、</p>
<p>（三）迷信皇槽日本維新的口號、是要尊王攘夷、他們迷信他們的天皇、是世界上獨一無二的統治者、大家絶對的擁護他、</p>
<p>日本民族、就因爲這個「日本迷」產生了上面三個結果、而他的民族也因此而發生了不可輕視的力量、</p>
<p>二、武士道武士道是日本維新運動的發動力、他的精神、就是一種生的奮鬥、爲求民族國家的生存而奮鬥、因這種奮鬥的精神、產生了他們「血淚的生活」、血就是對他的君主與民族國家流血犧牲的精神、淚就是爲愛憐他們的人民的精神、日本人民、處在此種生的奮鬥和血淚生活之中、所以他們對内是專制、對外能抵抗、這是日本民族所以强盛的第二個原因、</p>
<p>三、熱烈情感由日本人民熱烈情感中所表現出來的、也有三種精神、</p>
<p>（一）信仰的眞切日本民族的信仰心很堅、就是剛才我所說好似受了催眠術一樣的日本迷、</p>
<p>（二）爲大我奮鬥能犧牲小我爲大我去奮鬥、</p>
<p>（三）不打算這也是日本民族的一個好處、中國人遇見什麽事情總是先要爲個人私利經過一番細細地考慮打算、如果有不利於己的地方、就謝絶不幹、至於說到要他們爲國家民族去奮鬥犧牲、那是更不來了、而日本却不然、他們絶不爲自己打算、都肯負責、勇敢犧牲、我們紀得他們在日俄戰爭的時候、他們遇着了一條河、無法渡過去他們就絶不打算、爭先恐後的去塡滿那條河、讓他們的軍隊由上面渡過去、他們不但不退避、並且以爲愈塡在底下、愈爲光榮、這可見日本人的不打算、能負責、勇敢犧牲的精神、</p>
<p>日本人旣有了眞切的信仰、所以能不打算、因爲不打算、所以能够很負責很勇敢的去爲大我奮鬥犧牲、日本民族、就因人民有這種熱烈的情感、發生出熱烈的力量、這是日本民族所以强盛的第三個原因、</p>
<p>四·今後吾國公民敎育的主要原則現在我已把中外古今、各民族盛衰的因緣、大略的說過了、我們在這許多客觀而明顯的縱的歷史的陳蹟以及横的世界事象中、就可以歸納出今後吾國公民敎育應行注意的重要原則、這幾個原則、我不承認是什麽新奇的理論、祗能算是老生常談、你們不要以爲老生常談就是不好要曉得天下最有價値的、就是老生常談、老生常談、正好像家常便飯一樣、我們每日三餐、試問吃厭了沒有、我們在自然的生理上、不能天天拿希奇古怪的東西、來當作日常的食料同樣的在社會的生理上、也不能以新奇古怪的理論、去把衆生當試騐的蒭狗旨酒雖美、可以傷身、邪說惑人、可以喪邦、所以、眞正衛生的、决不貪口福、眞正能忠誠謀國者、也决不唱高調、在這一個信念上、我以爲今後吾國公民敎育的主要原則、當以下列三點爲旨歸、</p>
<p>一·啟發民族意識要啟發民族意識、我覺得至少要奉下例諸點爲信條、</p>

<p>▲獻給國貨工廠的領袖</p>
<p>爲目下國貨界打算，千端萬緒，好像是十分複雜，可是扼住要害，不過犖犖三大端：</p>
<p>（一）怎樣减低成本同一出品，何以人家賺錢，我們虧本？同樣一件紗，何以人家賣一百六十元，可以賺錢，我們賣一百八十元，還要虧本？同樣一疋布，我們賣三元總是折本，人家賣二元反而獲利？有時生薑湯白煖肚，還說他們有政府補助，其實那裏有這件事。天天說人家傾銷，說人家賤價競賣，其實天下無論那個人，决不做虧本生意。他們肯賤賣，自有他們的妙法。第一是原料的便宜，第二是機器的講究，保全得法，第三是工人的减少，第四是工作的頂眞，第五是辦事人的不揩油。而政府的帮忙，是運輸便利，保護周到。銀行家的帮忙，是利息低。學術家的帮忙，是研究深貢獻多。各方努力，效騐自來，這是第一要訣。</p>
<p>（二）怎樣改進出品同一出品，何以人家推陳出新，常常變花色，想新樣，好的更好，精了再精，我們老是這樣，當然不進則退。普通人心理，總是歡喜新奇的，倘使爲了提倡國貨，一定硬要呌人家常常用老式老樣的物品，亦非情理可通。所以工廠出品總要照着大學上『苟日新，又日新，日日新。』這句話，纔可以制勝外人，可操穩利。否則我們單是空口提倡國貨，說來說去，終究要惹人討厭的。改進出品，第一要羅致專門技師，第二要講究生產機器，第三要有優良設計，不斷的研究，不息的參觀考察，以求改良不已，難道到底趕不及人家麽？</p>
<p>（三）怎樣增加生產同一工廠，人家能製造迅速，大量出產，我們通病，往往約期不能出貨，遇到暢銷時候，而無貨可銷，及至貨物多了，而時令已過，此中損失，何可勝算？我前日參觀康元五和等廠，他們的製造，計算得準確萬分，什麽時候上機，什麽時候出貨，只有幾分鐘的參差。須知同一資本，同一工人，同一機器，同一開支，快的和慢的，相差多少？這種地方，全在有組織，有計畫，有賞罰的嚴明，有精確的審核，從主辦人以及小職員練習生，非要受過科學的洗禮，有科學的頭腦不可。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c213">白銀出口與國貨 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 丁杏</p>
<p>我國自本年一月間起，陸續有大批白銀出口。一般經濟學家，羣起撰文，述其利害。我們一般無知的小國民，當然莫測高深。就是有什麽佳妙的貢獻，也未能得大人先生們的採納！</p>
<p>不過自上月二十一日起，接二連三的又有大批白銀出口，連夜趕製銀箱咧，工人扛抬如何忙迫咧，······種種消息，載諸報端。據說：「總數爲一萬萬元。」</p>
<p>申報八，月二十六日時評最後一段說：「······我們看一看近年來上海華銀行，從内地所搜集的現銀是如何的充足，是怎樣的表示資金的集中。再看都市和農村的狀態如何？恐怕誰都不會有什麽滿意的結論吧！情形如此，卽令白銀永遠不流出去，滿滿地堆在銀庫中，難道我國的國民經濟就可以有什麽前進了嗎？」誠然的，在我們不懂經濟學的人看來，白銀出口，當然有相當利益的，不然，聰明銀行界，眞會幹這樣的笨事嗎？</p>
<p>八月二十六日申報：「七個月香水脂粉輸入一百餘萬元。」同日新聞報：「六個月紙烟輸入近二千萬元。」同上：「七月份對日貿易入超達二百九十餘萬元。」······等等驚人的消息，難道這鉅量的數字，就不是「白銀出口」嗎？這不過暗暗的流出，不爲國人所明知罷了。</p>
<p>美國的提高銀價，收買白銀，原是爲了他們自己備戰起見，而中國的白銀出口，是爲了有利可圖。不過其中最大的關鍵，就在大批白銀出口，那依金價計算的外國貨，却因了銀價提高而把貨値减低，於是中國市塲之上，平白地多了大批的外國貨，迷夢般的中國人，就要趨之若鶩了，我以爲在現在這樣的危急相乘的時候，更宜萬衆一心，切實的「服用國貨」纔好。要知道無形的白銀出口，丨丨就是去買外國貨，把金錢送到外洋去丨丨比較有形的白銀出口還要利害丨</p>
<p>大家很明瞭，白銀出口，是對於農村經濟，很有關係的，像現在的全國各省，閙着水，旱災的當兒，却又有大批白銀出口，這不是一件絶端矛盾的事嗎？所以我已說明了「有形」與「無形」。有形的，或許還有利可圖；無形的，却是如流水一般的逝去，永遠沒有利益，而且越流越少，越少越枯，非至滅絶時不止，到那時候，眞所謂是：「一籌莫展」了。</p>
<p>「切實服用國貨」，「勸君親友服用國貨」，這兩件大事，是現在中國人「對人」「對己」的最高無上的切身要事！</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3 id="c214">競爭和傾軋 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>國貨業裏面，我們時常可以聽到互相競爭的事，這並不是一件壞消息，只要競爭者沒有互相傾軋的意思，競爭就可以使出品更加優良，換一句話說：競爭就會使國貨事業進步。但是，有的大資本的商家，因爲要霸權於同業中，不顧利害，對於小資本傾軋，使他們不能立足。這才是國貨事業的一個危機。</p>
<p>譬如甲廠做一疋布，乙廠也做一疋布。如果甲廠和乙廠競爭了。那麽甲廠就設法研究這布怎樣可以使不退色？乙廠也找出怎樣才可以使布不容易破？這不是很有益處嗎？因爲世界上要使一件物件進步，最好的方法，就是競爭。</p>
<p>假使傾軋呢？甲廠因爲資本較大，便不管蝕本與否，减價競買，也就不得不跌價了。到了後來，乙廠就只好關店大吉，甲廠呢？不管布的質料和别人的信用，于是使得買國貨者不得不購求外貨，或竟對完全的國貨失了想信，這確是很重要的呀！</p>
<p>上面的話已說得很詳細，下面，我想吿訴賢明的購買者：</p>
<p>（一）假使有二件貨物，都是國貨的，你應該擇一件價較高貨物較好的，其次，你應該寫信給出品較劣的店家，吿訴他應謀出品的優良，同時勸吿他努力改良。</p>
<p>（二）假使你對於貨物的製造是有研究的，那麽更好了。你把不實用的或出品不良的緣故提出具體改良辦法來，給廠家做參攷。或者把外貨的製造的優點，吿訴他們改良。</p>
<p>我想，國家廠都想改良自己的出品，無形中就有一種可貴的競爭出來了。這不是有意思的事嗎？但是，有霸佔市塲的野心，這是無論如何要失敗的呀！</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>程志前以爲他們是感謝帶他們出去遊歷，因而感謝的，也連道這不算什麽。當時說得高興，盡歡而散。因爲程志前約好了，次日七時出發，所以張李二人到了早上五點鐘，就跳下床來。照着他二人的意思，以爲這個時候，必定是很早的。殊不知他們下床以後，旅館裏人，巳經是來往不絶。張李二人倒嚇了一跳，恐怕是起來晚了，程先生已走開。趕緊走到志前窗外向裏面張望着，見他側了身子，在床上鼾睡未醒，這才算是放了心。於是兩個人靜心靜意的在屋子裏等候着。始而是聽到程志前醒了，後來聽到他洗臉喝茶了，後來又聽到有茶房引了個人進去回話。一會兒功夫，他來喊道：張先生李先生起來了嗎？現在我們可以動身了，吳廳長沒有來，只派了車子來。我們這車子是要寛鬆得多。李士廉聽到，心想，我們第一天到，第二天就去遊園陵，那有這些閑情逸致？老實說，完全就爲的是會會吳廳長。旣是他不去，我也不要去了。他如此想着，推諉的話，還不曾說出來。張介夫道：好極，好極，我們就去罷。士廉以介夫已經答應了，自己却也是推諉不得。因爲程志前和吳廳長兄弟相稱，主席又請過他吃飯，總以不得罪他爲宜。於是也就委委屈屈的，跟着張程二人上了車子。及至出了大門的時候，才知道敎育廳已經派了一名常秘書奉陪，坐在車上，兀自未下來。程志前介紹之下，總算又認識了個官塲中人，心裏才安慰一點。汽車開出了西門，順着一條很寛平的公路，向西而行。（一三）</p>

<p>矮子李，天津人，客杭已久。</p>
<p>當「一二八」戰時，他從上海戰地寄來他的戎裝像片，英武動人，惟身材過矮，略視之類日人喬裝。</p>
<p>在像片裏附來短札，他說：「咱們中華男兒得替咱們中華掙氣」！他又說：「杭州不是咱們男兒常居處」！他呌我移居到他故鄕天津去，或者，也像他的投筆從戎到上海戰地去。</p>
<p>如今他已爲咱們中國犧牲了，然而咱們怎還記得有一個矮子李爲咱們犧牲了！</p>
<p>矮子李的影像常在我腦子裏盤旋，平素，他老是袒着胸說着他「咱們天津的故事多咧」！有一次，他吿訴我們他臉上的那個大疤的出典：那時他還在天津，他打一個爲日人作倀的天津著名的地痞，他也被那個地痞用石子擲了個大洞，頭上流了許多血，然而他不哼痛。</p>
<p>他的平生歷史：曾在北方賣過六年藝，在蘇州開過饅頭舖，杭州住過三年。</p>

<p>某縣長上×鄕視察災情。鄕長典質衣物殺鷄宰鴨請他。席間，鄕長請求着說：「總要縣長老爺帮忙，提早來救，我們眞苦死了。」縣長醉薰薰的說：「苦什麽！我們縣裏的人比你們還要苦，你們鄕下倒有得吃鷄吃鴨，我願一輩子住在你們鄕下。」</p>

<p>放着二個多月長的暑假，某小姐今年初中畢業會考及格，心頭無事，正可樂它一樂，早上從床舖子上一骨落爬起，哼着「花生米」那支曲子，方玻璃手錶上兩隻針正好九點十三分。</p>
<p>洗臉之前第一得吹吹風凉，站在三層樓那麽高的陽臺上，早晨已經這麽熱。</p>
<p>早餐放在檯上，照例是不用的，數二十四個銅子兒呌小大姐買一碗鱔絲拌麵吃麵看報，副刋，本埠新聞，廣吿，報看畢，麵吃完。</p>
<p>坐在客堂内太沒意思，動一動又會丢落四兩肉，手執一卷小弟弟或者小妹妹們的圖畫故事，小朋友畫報，靠在藤交椅上，兩脚向前擱起，搖搖芭蕉扇子，雖則比不上廬山靑島，但無憂無慮，其樂陶陶，身上不出一滴汗，要茶茶來，再熱則電風自來，坐到十一點半，後面溜溜坐坐，再停忽兒，便可吃中飯。</p>
<p>吃過中飯，談談笑笑，吃吃西瓜，不一會已經兩點半鐘，打個中覺，賽如游泳池中丨丨伊委實是不會游泳的。</p>
<p>倦眼惺忪，呌老媽子打水洗澡，一洗再洗日日洗，洗得乾乾凈凈，三花牌爽身粉噴噴香乘風凉，吃點心，張家姐姐來封信，明天你來剷麻將，看夜報，時光眞飛得快，天色又烏夜墨黑了，外面跑跑也好，反正很風凉，不然屋邊躱躱，唸着「咦！報吿單怎麽還不來，敎育局眞混蛋。」「下半年的書眞難呀！」「一粒馬眼寳鑲隻戒子祗十五塊。」</p>
<p>下面喊着吃夜飯。</p>
<p>肚子裝飽，搖搖扇子，吹吹風凉，等到九點一刻，上床睡覺，一𥇰睡到大天亮。</p>

<p>天上漏的時候，除是有雨衣或是汽車階級外，總得借重這圓形的洋傘；它一名雨傘，顧名思義，似乎遮雨之外不作别用的了！但是有着例外，街頭捉牙蟲的婦人，不論晴雨，老是和它手牽手結着不解緣？至於在田岸間行走的鄕農，常依它去抗烈日，但是都市裏的人們，除是下雨，總是不屑一顧，修洋傘的在雨天出現，也許是這個緣故？</p>
<p>據說女士們的大腿可以裸着，但是伊們的臉部是禁不起陽光晒的？於是時屆夏令，它就紅起來了！在街頭它常是依傍着女士們，其實呢？也是它在夏季穿得太漂亮，不像平時般褐色布袍一襲，不易受人靑睞，至於女士們呢？也不盡是爲遮陽，一半是爲着裝飾，盡報上時常有撑着傘的女子們的背影丨藝術照丨刋着，於是一則作爲裝飾品，一則藉以出風頭，相互利用，相得益彰。</p>
<p>爲着携帶累贅，男士們是非常蔑視它，卽使下雨也不顧借　它，但是有時爲着討好他的伊起見，也會和它行着着着握手禮？</p>
<p>這裏話更得說回來，男士們非絶對和它不妥洽，他們很多喜歡「飛洋傘」！這不是明證嗎？以前一位老同學，最近有了「飛洋傘」，我說：「老兄雨天可無慮了」？他說：「這是雨樣的呀！」</p>

<p>他們因爲所有的錢實在太少了，天天要活人吃的米，尙嫌不够，怎能再去辦那祭死人的酒菜，和化給死人用的紙錠呢？於是每逢清明節，他們雖然也一般的前去掃墓，但酒菜和紙錠是絶對不帶的了；他們只就墳的左近，掘幾塊泥土，親自捧着去堆在各個墳的頂上，再打道旁的楊柳樹上，隨便折幾枝嫩綠的新柳，揷在那泥塊的中央，丨丨因爲楊柳是每年春季最先有葉子長出來的樹木，所以人們對於它，也不免靑眼相看。丨丨作爲一種點綴品。這種點綴品，當然不是給過路的人賞鑒的，他們的意思是要使自己的祖宗知道他們雖然很窮，甚至無力購備紙錠，但在他們的心上，却還始終惦記着各位祖先咧！這樣，各位祖先雖然沒有酒菜好吃，也沒有紙鈔好用，而在心靈上，終於已得到一種安慰；做子孫的能使他們的祖先的在天之靈有以自慰，畢竟是可以歸納入「孝思不匱」的一類中去了！最後的一種人家，竟連泥土和新柳也不能備了；這裏所說的不能備，當然不是說他們買不起泥土或新柳，因爲這兩件東西原是不須化錢買的。但也許他們的祖墓離他們的家太遠了，他們或因盤費的缺乏，或因忙於工作，以圖糊口，不能前去，沒法就祗得讓他們的祖宗受些委曲了！現在，就是這一堆永遠無人前來祭掃的義塚所顯示着的荒凉悽寂的現象，打動了太后的龍心，以致於使伊在極興奮的旅途中，突然感受到了一陣不能形容的悲哀。（一二二）</p>

<h3 id="c224">北遊的幾個小印象 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>這回雖只到泰安爲止，但是已踏進了北國的地域了，北國的風槪，自然和南國不同，有幾個小印象，使我永遠不會忘記的。</p>
<p>春聯丨無論在城裏，在城外，沒有一家門楣上不貼着一副春聯的。上面再加上四個字的額，春聯的句子，多數是頌揚意味的吉祥文字，恐怕都是現成的句子。但是以前所習用的「皇恩春浩蕩，文治日光華。」現在已沒有了。在曲阜常有關涉孔二先生的，表示他們住在聖人之邦，𨴬家都是受孔敎的薰陶，而蔚成儒家的讀書種子的。字也難得瞧見很好的。這種非大衆化的文藝，倒大衆化了。在那裏都是泥打墻，至多牆脚砌幾尺磚頭，建築這們的簡陋，却不肯省掉春聯，春聯和南國少女的脂粉一般的成了不可少的裝飾。</p>
<p>人力車丨這是文化交流的利器，要是這地方有了人力車，那新的物質文明，便逐漸的運輸過來了。人力車是發祥於日本，上海接受得最早，但是到了現在，上海的人力車，遠不及北國的人力車，他們都是黑色的車身，實在不應當喚他黄包車。大喇叭發出宏大的聲音，上面裝着白布篷，車夫也得到蔭蔽，車柄上都鑲着黄銅，有的擦得雪亮，點的燈也是很堂皇地分置在左右，一切都和上海的自用包車差不多。不像蘇州的黄包車，小而且破，天雨了，那個篷張起來，上面碰頭，前面碰膝，包管濕得像落湯鷄。</p>
<p>蒼蠅丨在南國些微有一點衛生常識的人，都把蒼蠅恨得什麽似的，但是在北國便平淡無奇了。那些放在露天的攤子上的什物，儘管給蒼蠅攅滿了，不去驅逐他的。這幾天西瓜的殼，桃梨的皮，都是引誘蒼蠅的東西，所以到處有嗡嗡的聲音繁響着。我們瞧見了，竟不敢要他了。車站上的小販，比較的明白些，他們知道把一個很密的網遮在水果上面，放鷄的匣子有蓋的。</p>
<p>毛厠丨毛厠在北國是最齷齪了，旅館也如此，只有沿鐵路幾個大站上的「賓館」，纔有抽水馬桶，你要解决排泄問題，先要嫻熟那登坑技能。北國朋友簡直不會上馬桶的，所以兗州鐵路賓館，有一個抽水毛厠，算是因地制宜的新發明。</p>
<p>布丨在北國難得瞧見穿綢衣的，大多數是用布的。儘是靑春時代的少女，也穿着布衣，因爲伊們還未沾染到上海風，伊們沒有那麽勇氣，用一種華麗的顏色，和芳香的氣息，去引誘異性，使他們來追求。所以我見幾個女學生，有的穿着月白竹布的，有的穿着紫地黑花布的，還是南國的十九世紀呢。男子更努力地用布了，鞋子也難得用綢緞的。並且以靑和白兩種正色最習見，這是北國的精神。</p>
<p>渡過了長江，什麽都變換啦，難道這們的旱荒，南國朋友的生產牽，還比北國强多麽？我不信！</p>

<h3 id="c248">「少數」與「特殊」 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>有一位劉麟生先生著了一部「駢文學」，在商務印書館出版，因而他又在商務印書館的「出版周刋」上發表一篇「駢文研究法」，據他說來，雖在「這個高唱改良文學的時期中」，那「堆砌式的貴族文學」的駢文，還是値得「研究」，去學去做的，他的理由如下：</p>
<p>「少數人所欣赏的文學，學者以貴族文學稱之。假定這個名詞是至當不可移易的。那麽我們便須認識兩點：（少數）人所贊成的東西，不見得是壞的。這在政治學上，曾經有過熱烈的討論。發表少數人的意見，（minorityreprosentation）是今後政治上的一種方略，姑且不必細論。說到文學方面，也何嘗不是如此咧？詞與駢文，比較總是欣賞的人較少。（二）少數人所欣賞的東西，往往後來成爲多數人欣賞的東西。駢文固然不見得有這種趨勢，然而駢文的支流餘裔，如賀聯輓聯以及懸掛的對聯，能彀給人欣賞的地方，也著實是不少了。」</p>
<p>還有一層道理，則爲「駢文是我國特殊的產物」，足以對西洋文學「揚眉吐氣。」</p>
<p>說「少數」人的東西好，說「特殊」的東西可貴，這並不是劉先生在替駢文辨護時臨時找來的理由，而根本是從他們的意識形態出發的。我就用劉先生對於駢文的見解證明這一點。</p>
<p>劉先生的「駢文學」中，介紹着許多駢文作家，其清代的一部分，也發表在「出版周刋」上，他在每一作家的傳略後面，摘錄着這作家的警句，還有評語，如下式。</p>
<p>「毛奇齡，字大可，蕭山人。學者稱西河先生。明諸生。明亡，祝髮山谷，讀書土室中。康熙中，召試鴻博，授檢討，纂修明史，後以病乞歸。年九十四卒。所著經集文集，共二百三十四卷。</p>
<p>警句　自昔建武致治，寵干奸兵：貞觀昇平，高羅叛命。（平滇頌朱旗拭淚，盡作胭脂，素鉞失心，勿縣經國。（沈雲英墓誌銘）</p>
<p>西河以經學家而爲文，厚重不落時艶。沈雲英墓誌銘，最可代表。錢基博稱其整散兼行，並非鈎棘。」</p>
<p>駢文本身和清人的駢文，都自有其價値，當作古董看看，原也另有一種意思，然而要看必須看其全篇，摘出一兩句警句來欣賞，就毫無意思了。（我曾有「警句」一文，詳論此事，在這裏不多講道理了）譬如上引的毛西河的警句，在原文中誠然是出色的，但必須和全文聯繫起來，方有意思，現在孤立地摘出來看，我們看得出什麽好處來呢？再看看其他的警句，也是一樣，如陳其年的「倘有高軒入魏，幸言朱亥於市中：至於絳綬遊吳，願述伯鸞於廡下」。袁子才的「如太陽之沃霜雪，所過皆消；譬久旱之得雲霓，歸來恐後。」</p>
<p>然而有些人們爲什麽讀文章只讀警句呢？這是他們的意識形態使然，因爲他們的意識形態是個人主義的，所以範圍褊狹，宇宙間一切現象，在他們心目中，毫無聯繫性，只是一個個的孤立的，在個個孤立的現象中，他們找一個於自己有利的現象加以崇拜，視之爲諸現象的代表者統御者。因此在這些人眼中，沒有整個的宇宙，只有一個懸在中天的太陽，沒有整個的民族國家，只有帝王和將軍。沒有聯繫演變的歷史，只有特殊的盛衰之跡，甚而至於看花也只看看揷在瓶中的一枝，看文章也看旁邊打圈的幾句······</p>
<p>凡是這樣的人們，必定重視特殊，根本不會認識宇宙的本體，社會的機搆。對於大衆精神，當甚不會理解的。</p>

<p>「那一定學問上還有什麽缺點吧！或者我們說「仁愛」「仁愛」，别人並不相信我們的話呀，或者機會等待着我們，我們不曾抓住機會呀！」</p>
<p>「那有這話！伯夷叔齊不是活活餓死的嗎？王子比干爲什麽不好好地投機，還等待人家來剖他的肚子呢？唉！「匪兕匪虎，率彼曠野！」我們爲什麽這樣倒霉呢！」</p>

<p>「夫子也得遷就一些兒呀！這個社會，這個人羣，不遷就總是行不通的。」</p>
<p>「呌我怎樣遷就呢？「吾豈匏瓜也哉！焉能繫而不食？」在魯國，在楚國，只要有機會，我總一本正經想替他們做點事，他們總一脚踢開我，讓我滾來滾去。那回，連公山不狃招呼我，我都想去試一試。遷就，遷就，總有一個限度，遷呌我怎樣遷就呢？」</p>
<p>子貢默想了一回，覺得無話可說，也就退了出來。顏淵最後進去，仲尼極親熱地對他說：</p>
<p>「回，您說：「匪兕匪虎，率彼曠野！」我們爲什麽這樣倒霉呢？」</p>
<p>「夫子不必想到這方面的事。我們有財寳，他們不識貨，足見他們是爲多大的混蛋，我們何必想到倒霉不倒霉的事呢！」</p>

<p>— 狄舟</p>
<p>在Ｒ路上走着，使我陷入回憶裏了。我愼重地望着路旁的一所洋房子，牆色依然是紅的，可是有點黯然的樣子。以前是女生宿舍及圖書館的後面的一幢長方形的房子，靜悄悄的，沒有一個人。就在這裏，火爐在房内燒着，狹小的地方，坐滿看書的人，每人腦内，都有熱情在陰陰燃燒；每人胸中，都有期望在閃閃隱現丨自然，各人是各人的，相同的也有。</p>
<p>再緩緩前進幾步，建築的左側部，帶着許多窗眼，對着我了。窗子現在緊閉着。打開來讓陽光照進課室裏吧丨是的，那時正是冬末春初，冷冰冰的寒氣，就在日裏也向我們衝擊。我們把窗都打開，讓冷氣流，讓陽光進來。專心致志地揮動着鉛筆，在拍紙簿上記下講師的講義。我的眼睛，射出怎樣敬佩，愉快和堅毅的視綫呀丨夜裏，燈光明亮，像開宴會大張夜飲一般，跳躍着心·漲紅着臉，登上講臺，「同學們，社會進化的動力在那裏？丨今晚我們要來答覆這個問題···」響亮的聲音，緊張了空氣。夜，失掉了寂靜，倒像海潮的冲前和退後，掩以噝丨的緊促的大風。夜闌了，每人還是興奮，互相拍着肩膀，大脚步跨出校門······</p>
<p>稍遠，那片草塲臥在陽光裏，沒有一些改變，只那時的草才顯出綠色，挾着或捧着書本的人散亂地走着，或站住。清早和黄昏，常會從周圍聚集了許多人，像在俱樂部一般，放聲大笑，高聲地說話。又是兩個，三個地邊談邊走。我也曾和一個人，低低地談着：</p>
<p>「這不是尋常的學校呵！四面八方的城鎭鄕村，我們的同學都是從那邊歸來，想得到高深的造就」</p>
<p>「自人生的戰綫上回來的人倒底是另一樣呵，過去我唸了七年的書，還抵不到這裏的一天課程呢」</p>
<p>面向着草塲，是敞開的閱報室。雖然我這時不能看見它，那印象，却和眼前的景物一樣清晰。每日的早上，送報的未來，已有人在那兒靜等。報紙始終被這隻或那隻手所按着，我常在等候，時間靜靜延長下去，依然是擁擠，我便注視閱報人的姿態了。多數是邊看邊想，一個問題又一個問題似的，露着熱忱的半面像。我不耐煩了，便凑上去，和他們齊看。</p>
<p>離了閱報室，少數的兩三個一隊，向草塲走去，輕輕地對談。我，本來對於國際政治僅是糢糊地認識，在這數個月的雾圍氣中，我開始有較爲明確的槪念了。我開始懂得在小本子上摘錄每日國内外的大事。</p>
<p>Ｒ路，我所紀念的一條街。</p>
<p>從紅色的洋房子向西走一里多路，有一座朝北的房子，其中有一個房間，我有一張床在那裏占了一塊地方。Ｒiazanov的一本通俗著作的英譯本，我就在那裏丨靠着寛大的窗，看了一段落，便望過四方的空地，視綫停留在遠遠的天空的一角丨看完的。那裏，有我濃烈的友情，我們常時談着，談到夜半人靜。我記得在一個晚間，我寫了如次的詩句：</p>
<p>「我沒有别的思慮，我只沈溺着學習和友誼。」</p>
<p>「靜的生命在躍動，如掠過秋的空中的疾風。」</p>
<p>Ｒ路，我所紀念的一條街。我不禁又走回原路，向東步着了。可惜這時不是放工的時份，不然，我會如那時一樣，看到成千成萬的工人，成爲洪水，向四周汎濫。和聽到男女工人的笑謔，解消着他們終日的疲勞。我走到Ｒ路的東端了，齷齪的河流，是終年不變的，彷彿是工人身上充滿塵灰和煤烟的汗水的蓄貯。廠房依然那樣突直，莊嚴，機聲依然在響，在鳴，但立在河邊的我，已沒有再溢滿着可歌可泣的革命的羅曼蒂克的心情了。</p>
<p>那時，離現在巳經五年了。在Ｒ路上走着，便想起了過去，它在我的記憶裏，是立在岔路的交义地。</p>

<p>— 華圉</p>
<p>（十）不必恐慌</p>
<p>上次說過，在不識字的大衆裏，是一向就有作家的。我久不到鄕下去了，先前是，農民們還有一點餘間，譬如乘凉，就有人講故事。不過這講手，大抵是特定的人，他比較的見識多，說話巧，能够使人聽下去，懂明白，並且覺得有趣。這就是作家，抄出他的話來，也就是作品。倘有語言無味，偏愛多嘴的人，大家是不要聽的，還要送給他許多冷話丨丨譏刺。我們弄了幾千年文言，十來年白話，凡是能寫的人，何嘗個個是文學家呢？即使都變成文學家，又不是軍閥或土匪，於大衆也並無害處的，不過彼此互看作品而已。</p>
<p>還有一種是怕文學的低落。大衆並無舊文學的修養，比起士大夫文學的細緻來，或者會顯得所謂「低落」的，但也未染舊文學的痼疾，所以牠又剛健，清新。無名氏文學如「子夜歌」之流，會給舊文學一種新力量，我先前已經說過了；現在也有人紹介了許多民歌和故事。還有戲劇，例如「朝花夕拾」所引「目蓮救母」裏的無常鬼的自傳，說是因爲同情一個鬼魂，暫放還陽半日，不料被閻羅責罰，從此不再寛縱了丨丨</p>
<p>「那怕你銅墻鐵壁！</p>
<p>那怕你皇親國戚！」······</p>
<p>何等有人情，又何等知過，何等守法，又何等果决，我們的文學家做得出來麽？</p>
<p>這是眞的農民和手業工人的作品，由他們間中扮演，借目蓮的巡行來貫串許多故事，除「小尼姑下山」外，和刻本的「目蓮救母記」是完全不同听。其中有一段「武松打虎」，是甲乙兩人，一强一弱，扮着戲玩。先是甲扮武松，乙扮老虎，被甲打得要命，乙埋怨他了，甲道：「你是老虎，不打，不是給你咬死了！」乙只得要求互換，却又被甲咬得要命，一說怨話，甲便道：「你是武松，不咬，不是給你打死了？」我想：比起希臘的伊索，俄國的梭羅古勃的寓言來，這是毫無遜色的。</p>
<p>如果到全國的各處去收集，這一類的作品恐怕還很多。但自然，缺點是有的。是一向受着難文字，難文章的封鎖，和現代思潮隔絶。所以，倘要中國的文化一同向上，就必須提倡大衆語，在衆文，而且書法更必須拉丁化。</p>

<p>有一回，我在報上看見戰爭又起了。似乎很厲害，七八個大部隊的代表都在忙碌。這個跑過去，那個跑過來。接着就是通電。這個也要保衛桑梓，那個也要保衛桑梓。情形是一步一步的緊起來了。而且是大規模的。火綫接觸的地方，就離弟弟他們那兒不遠。自然他們這回又參加火綫了。</p>
<p>我很担心他，他這時不過是一個候差員，送上前綫去是不成問題的了。他一個星期來一封信，可是一個月以後就不曾來了。我很着急，寫信到家裏去問，而家裏也寫信來問我。說不定這回准是死了。報上曾經登載着一個這樣的消息，這回的戰爭曾經有許多外國人拿着望遠鏡在高山上觀陣，見兩軍白刃肉搏，死傷數萬，認爲雖第一次世界大戰也不過如是。呵，完了！我悲傷地把報紙丢在一旁，望着那窓外灰暗的天空，我才後悔我不該早不把弟弟勸回家去了！</p>

<h3 id="c253">機器發明以後 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>二十世紀的文明，是機器的文明。人類自從十九世紀機器發明以後，社會情形，起了一個急劇的變化。這個變化，便决定了近代人類的運命。機器發明以後，對於人類社會，究竟予以如何的影響？這因人的觀點之不同，而異其詞。</p>
<p>一部份人說，機器發明以後，社會上的生產力，突然增加了幾百十倍。從前手工業時代的生產方法極其簡陋，只憑着人類的兩隻手及粗劣的工具去製造物品，故生產力非常薄弱。機器工業時代就進步得多了，生產方法旣經改良，一部機器足以代替百千人的工作，因是生產力便一天增加一天。生產力一增加，人類的物質慾望就獲得了充分的滿足。而且，跟着生產力的增加，社會上的物質建設，便也自然而然地進步起來。十九世紀以前，世界上幾曾看到像現代這樣一艘横斷汪洋大海中的巨大輪船？幾曾看到像現代這樣一個大足供給一大都市全居民應用的電氣工程？這些物質建設，正是機器發明之賜。</p>
<p>可是另一部份人說，機器發明以後，社會上呈露在我們眼前的一個明顯的現象，卽是人類貧富階級的懸隔。機器發明以後，社會上的生產力量，雖然增加了很大，可是這一種增加，却僅是少數擁有機器者的幸福，大多數的勞作者，反而陷入一個異常悲慘的境地。這里有着十九世紀以前所無的資產階級和勞動階級的分别，這種階級的存在，便是機器發明以後所產生出來的罪惡。此外，機器發明以後的第二個不良的事實，就是人類工作的機器化。工作是神聖的，但總要有點興趣才是。未有發明機器以前，人類的工作，大半本着自已的能力所及和興趣所至以從事，其工作多少有些藝術化。然而有了機器以後，工作情形就改變了。無數工人在工廠裏作工，表面看來是工人在駕御機器，其實呢，却是機器在役使工人。工人簡直變成機器的奴隸。這種工作，其乾燥乏味，可以想見。</p>
<p>以上二說，各有各的片面理由。但機器給予我們人類社會的偉大的貢獻，這是一椿明白的事實，誰也不能加以否認。而產生出來的各種惡劣的病態，亦是不一而足。不過以我們的觀察，機器的發明，實不能不說是人類的無限的幸福。蓋我們有了機器，我們可以利用牠的力量，來改善我們人類的生活，提高我們人類的文化。至若其所遺給我們的不良的影響，只要我們人類善於運用調劑。能够好好把牠使用在有益的方面，其壞的部分，是不難立刻消除的。不然，機器本身是沒有什麽毒害的，現代人類社會因機器的發明而呈示出來的種種惡果，這都是人類自己的罪惡的表現。</p>
<h3 id="c254">麗娃麗妲河泛舟追記 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>是往事了，原是一篇很有生趣的題材，不知怎的一宕宕到今日，才拿起筆來作「追記」。個性原有點「因循」，連寫稿都受了傳染，應該是很危險了。我自己有這麽一個自覺。</p>
<p>麗娃麗妲這是蜚聲滬上的所在，那天我同幾個朋友游泳了一個下午，約定晚上再划船。晚上八九點鐘光景，一輪皓月掛在東邊的天際外，乳白的清輝照澈了將睡的宇宙，分外的幽清，分外的舒適，我們正團坐在校内的草坪上談天說地。童就像猴猻般的跳着呌近來了，說是船已預備好了，南公已在划了幾個週𢌞，其實說已預備好了還不如說已偷着了較爲妥當，船是學校裏的，原是一徑鎖着不開放的。童有一把鑰匙碰巧可以套開，所以他有夜夜船划的專利。我們到了河沿，才發現汝落了陣，鞠說他預備點心去了，我們才放心他不是「失踪」。</p>
<p>船，偷來了兩隻，艙面狹小，造船的匠人，似乎是只曾打算到給愛人倆划玩的，坐三個人的確有些容擠不下，而且一坐上去，船就好像沉似的，吃水特别深。於是發生了一個問題，　有「羅　」之　　　　，體重總在三百鎊以上我們一起六個人，每隻船坐三個，本是公分無私，只有他不好分配，推推扯扯了一回，汝才把他拉上了他的一隻船。</p>
<p>本來大家都帶着一股腦兒的高興，夜深了，天氣又格外來得凉爽舒適，兩隻船競賽的划了幾轉，大家到了氣力使盡了的時候，才把篙子一撑，停在水中央。這是汝獻功勞的時候了，他把預備好的汽水點心，擺上船頭。這裏完全是實行共產的，不，簡直是導演着掠奪行爲，一忽兒就搶光了。不過，有値得歌頌的地方，是雖然掠奪，到底還是平均分配，六隻嘴是一個時候停止的，所謂掠奪，其實不過是「玩弄」的異詞。</p>
<p>時會是異樣的幽靜，人們是異樣的歡愜，我們呷着汽水，我們嚼着糖菓，各個人所有的平昔失意悲傷，都電閃般的溜失了。無邊的論談，無邊的歡笑，我們好像六個天生的驕子，一齊逍遙在天國裏。</p>
<p>當我們正嚼得高興談得忘形的當兒，右邊忽的划來了兩隻等大的船、是兩對愛人兒，呞呞呞的划水聲，應答着嬝嬝不絶的歌音，將我們的注意力吸住了，大家不免有些感嘅，我們實在都太可憐太苦惱了，倘若是······當亦有一番使人羡　的　景啊。</p>
<p>於是我們又鼓起着氣力，重　我們的搖槳，承受着脈脈的月老水影，划到了河的黝黑的彼端，呵，這兒的秘密更多了，無數的船隻都靜寂的撑住在河邊，有的相偎的在船艙裏睡着了，有的上了岸，在偎蹲着竊竊私語，忽的一陣緊張的淫笑聲從黑影裏傳來。這環境使我們忍受不住，我們相約的又向河的另一端搖去，不一回，就搖到了麗娃麗妲村，這裏是名勝，是雅景，岸上是一個龐大的樂園，有跳舞塲，有咖啡座，有霓紅燈的映射，有爵士樂的繁響。琨聽得忘形了，還兩眼瞪瞪地注視着，我故意把船身左右一拐，嚇得他胆顫心驚，他才向我吿饒。一閃瞬，童，他們的一隻，巳不知去向了，原來他們更其忍受不住這環境的誘惑，已划去碼頭上岸了，我們也只得疾然划將歸去，這時巳是闃無人聲，靜寂到岸上的草叢裏彷彿有着小蟲子在跳呌。</p>
<p>這一夜之游，雖說是排遣了平日不少的積鬰，却也備受着無窮的懊惱，尤其是事後身體感到分外的疲勞。躺上鞠的床舖，一覺睡到翌日的中午，還像一條懶蛇般的爬不起床來。</p>

<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>（「人底本性是體騐太陽，</p>
<p>我們底沈沈着的性情便該是不要去反對太陽啊。」丨丨Ｄ·ＨＪ·陸侖斯：「鳥獸與花」）</p>
<p>就說生活的塲合該像鍊獄一般的吧，那也好：望着未來的時日的海，這中間蕩動着的是饑餓，恥辱，苦痛，困厄：多少年了，用一隻眼睛看着社會的歷史的動，可是也得留着一隻眼睛照顧自己的生存呢。人世的混合酒中是沒有紅的櫻桃與黄的波羅的，這我們都知道得最清楚，可是我們不斷地飲着。</p>
<p>說生活是鍊獄一般的吧，可是鍊獄中也有機會看得到太陽呢。早晨，不是嗎？太陽是大的，紅紅的，像車輪向日葵一般地放着許多針刺。人瞧着他，眼睛給炙痛啦：可是他是熱的，健康的，勞働動，强有力的，這光亮，消滅了夜的　黑，　黑了公子小姐的慘白的皮膚。充實了秋季的麥穗，滲進了病房的衛帘，陪伴了孤獨者的漫步。</p>
<p>但是，假使生活的塲合果眞是鍊獄一般的話，那是都够慶幸的事呢。眞的，鍊獄對於我們是天堂。不是嗎？就是在鍊獄中也看得到太陽呢；可是我們是生活在地下層的，在地下層生活着的人，太陽是永遠地僅存在在夢的虚構裏面的。</p>
<p>生活在地下層的人是沒有回憶，沒有籌思，沒有感傷，也沒有猜忌的。當然啦，過去的回憶與未來的籌思在我們簡直成了一種裝飾品了，這些，我們是沒有權利要的，起先是不能要，可是，你知道，後來在黑暗中習慣了之後，便簡直不屑要咧。我們知道的就祇有「現在」，「現在」是眞實的，血淋淋的，可是我們得把握住它，死命地抓着，不呌滑去；，不然，便早就失掉了生存的可能性咧。正像日夜在礦山中地下層工作着的年老的礦工一樣的，一分鐘一分鐘地搥着死一樣的煤塊，得緊張地把注意力集中在現在的一煞那。如果遇到了偶然的爆炸，那是必需有狗一般的靈敏把身軀立刻伏下的，不然你便給毁滅啦。</p>
<p>當然給毁滅是誰都不願意的。這樣，他們縱然是年老的，也得握住正在過去的現存的一閃間。誰還能記憶着年靑時候的活菊與笑，與曾在他身上照過的幼年時代的陽光呢？</p>
<p>可是生活在地下層中的人却知道記念着太陽；太陽該不是一種夢吧，人在前一個時候是或許見到他底光亮的手臂，於是便永遠地成爲一種不可磨滅的記憶了。而目前，在黑暗羣中，太陽是給像神話一般地談論着的。</p>
<p>記憶着，記憶着；不，甚至是努力的搜索了，可是那有什麽用呢？太陽和我們是給隔離了的，隔離的是重重的生活的鞭子所織成的厚幕。</p>
<p>驚奇着，二十世紀的太陽也是商品化了的；「上等人」在太陽光底下打網球，游泳，演鍍金戀愛的喜劇：那太陽也是熱的，嬌媚的，南方的果樹園的。</p>
<p>而這些在地下層生活着的人是沒有的，我們是沒有的。</p>
<p>但並不是在地下層生活着的我們是本元地沒有的。我們是得到了而又給隔離了的。人要努力去揭去這一層生活的幕子，該是多困難的事情啊。然而，爲了太陽，我們是什麽多能忍受的。</p>
<p>沒有太陽的人是不能生活的，自家兒是沒有太陽的嗎？誰說呢？不錯，縱說也是生活在地下層的，可是太陽却一樣地存在在自己的記憶中呢，永久地，永久地。</p>
<p>就在記憶中也好，我有我底太陽，而祇有我底太陽才能使我活下去的。</p>

<p>Three Breaches on the Upper Reaches of the Luan River</p>
<p>Water Levels in the Ji and Yun Rivers Surge</p>
<p>Severe Flooding in Yutian and Other Counties</p>
<p>Tangshan City Flooded to a Depth of Several Feet</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 3rd, the Luan River swelled dramatically, with three breaches on the upper reaches, each over twenty yards long. Dozens of boats were swept away without a trace. Villages along the river were submerged, with floodwaters four feet deep in the fields. Residents in the flooded areas took temporary refuge on rooftops and treetops. Countless people drowned. The Beining-Luan River railway bridge was only four or five feet above the water, posing a significant risk to the structure. The speed of passing trains has been reduced to five miles per hour. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 3rd, Yutian experienced a day and night of severe rainstorms, leading to mountain torrents and a surge in the Huanxiang and Ji-Yun Rivers. The rivers flooded the city and suburbs, reaching a depth of several feet. Breaches occurred along both banks at four or five locations, widening the river channel by four to five times. Hundreds of villages were submerged, with countless belongings washed away. Residents fled to higher ground in Hongqiao Town, building shelters for refuge. Thousands of flood victims are awaiting relief. County Magistrate Chen Baosheng has telegraphed the provincial government requesting assistance. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 3rd, Tangshan experienced all-day heavy rain. The Kailuan Mining Bureau's river overflowed, flooding the city to a depth of four feet. Shops in low-lying areas were inundated, causing incalculable losses to merchants. Train No. 101 from Tianjin to Kai and Yu was delayed at Tangshan Station for two hours due to flooding on the railway before proceeding eastward. The suburbs suffered particularly badly as the Dou River overflowed its banks, causing extensive damage. Countless fields were flooded, over a hundred houses collapsed, and transportation was completely disrupted. On the 4th, it was still drizzling, and the sky had not cleared. In Fengrun, heavy rain on the night of the 3rd caused the Dou River, a coal transport river, to overflow its banks, flooding farmland on both sides. The city was flooded to varying depths of three to four feet. Long-distance roads were washed away. Xuanzhuang and Wanglanzhuang, being low-lying, were submerged. The county government dispatched personnel to organize rescue teams and telegraphed the provincial government for relief funds. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 4th, the Dou River, due to sudden mountain torrents, could not contain the water volume and rose several feet, causing three breaches in the dikes, each approximately twenty yards long. Dozens of villages were submerged. Fengrun County Magistrate Zhang Renrong ordered the local militia to assist the villagers in attempting to close the breaches and dispatched personnel to provide relief to the flood victims.

<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong telegraphed the Central Government, reporting on the flood situation in Changyuan and Puyang Counties, stating that winter was approaching and relief was urgently needed. Last year, a disaster relief station was established at Daokou, saving countless flood victims. He requested permission to establish a disaster relief station in Changyuan and Puyang to handle winter relief efforts. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Qinglu, the County Magistrate of Changyuan, telegraphed the province, reporting that the main stream of the Yellow River had suddenly shifted northward, causing the collapse of the Fenglou earthen levee, reaching 40 meters from the Yanggeng Dam. The water flow was extremely turbulent. The County Magistrate was leading the local laborers, along with the River Bureau Chief, in emergency repairs. If Fenglou cannot be secured, the Yanggeng Dam will be in grave danger. The water level continues to rise, and the provincial government has telegraphed orders for immediate patching of the breach.

<p>On the 4th, the Yellow River south of Linhe County overflowed its banks. The river water rushed into the county from the southeast corner, blocking all four gates, leaving no outlet for the water. The city walls are made of earth and are in an extremely dangerous condition. Many canals near the county were breached. The water at the southeast corner of the city wall has accumulated to a depth of over two feet. The military and civilians are working together to block the breaches and drain the water.

<p>Talks Between Yin Rugeng and Shibayama</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng stated that the long-distance telephone poles destroyed by the flood in Sanhe County have been repaired. Bandits from Tangshan, Fengrun, and Baodi Counties have been routed by the security forces and are being pursued. Regarding issues in the war zone, discussions will be conducted jointly with Tao Shangming after his arrival in Beiping. Japanese and Korean thugs are selling drugs in the war zone, and strict orders have been issued to all counties to investigate and confiscate drugs. Several cases have been transferred to Beiping and sent to the Japanese police for punishment. However, continuous heavy rain has disrupted transportation, causing difficulties. Shibayama stated that he met with Yin Tong upon his return to Beiping and briefly discussed issues related to the war zone. Yin Rugeng plans to personally inspect the Eastern Mausoleums before taking them over, and Shibayama will accompany him. When the right to manage the Eastern Mausoleums is officially transferred, the Manchu troops stationed there will be withdrawn. The issue of deploying the newly formed Hebei security forces in the war zone, numbering 9,000, has not been fully determined and requires resolution by both sides. The issue of weapons will be discussed after the number of troops is decided. Concrete decisions regarding the overall situation in the war zone must wait until Huang returns to Beiping. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to relevant sources, discussions regarding the reorganization of the war zone will commence with the Japanese side after an exchange of views with Tao Shangming upon his arrival in Beiping within the next few days. There will be no formal meetings. The telephone poles along the line from Sanhe to Bangjun in eastern Hebei, which were previously destroyed by rain, have now been repaired, and communication is normal. However, the roads remain difficult to travel, and continuous alternation of sunny and rainy weather makes it impossible to begin repairs. Traffic to Gubeikou from Beiping has also been completely cut off recently. Japanese vehicles from Miyun to Gubeikou have suspended operation. Transportation within the war zone is extremely inconvenient. Repairs can only begin after the autumn rains decrease. The scattered bandits in Yutian have been routed by the security forces, and local peace and order have been restored. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Rumors in Tianjin Subside</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Public Security Bureau has arrested twenty people, including Liu Guitang's fake division and brigade commanders. The Judiciary Department interrogated them and sent those with the most serious offenses to the Fifth Army Headquarters. The rest will remain in the Bureau for further interrogation. Rumors in Tianjin have subsided, and society is calm. Most of the members of Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan's puppet troops are scattered in the suburbs, avoiding investigation and arrest by the authorities. Liu and Shi recruited nearly a thousand men for their fake East Asia Republican Army and Peace-Preservation National Salvation Army. But the majority of them joined due to poverty and aimed to make a quick profit. After obtaining money, they deserted. Due to the recent crackdown by the authorities, they are fleeing in alarm. Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan's residences on Yoshino Street and Naniwa Street in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin are afraid that our side will send detectives to search them, so they deploy multiple plainclothes teams to patrol the streets daily, unreasonably inspecting and detaining passersby.

<p>(Nanjing) It was reported that the Ministry of Finance's expenditures exceed its revenues and will issue government bonds worth 30 million yuan. Finance Vice Minister Qin Fen said that China's finances have been on track in recent years. Although the monthly deficit is 10 million yuan, over 170 million yuan is repaid in old debts each year. Based on this statistic, the annual income can still cover the expenses. If there were no old debts, there would be no deficit. The current financial income situation means that there is no need to issue government bonds again this year. The rumor of issuing 30 million yuan is not accurate. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Habsburg Restoration Issue - Ting <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>It was recently rumored that Austrian President Miklas will resign this autumn. His successor will either be Archduke Eugen or Vice Chancellor Prince Starhemberg. If this comes to fruition, the issue of the Habsburg dynasty's restoration will undoubtedly attract serious attention from European countries. It might even create a situation where Hitlerism and Austrian legitimism clash.</p>
<p>The Habsburgs in Central Europe are not merely an ordinary royal family but a deeply rooted organization. Although the power they wielded was completely eliminated by the last Great War, the potential of their organization still exists. Recently, it has even shown signs of resurgence. We may recall that Karl, the last emperor of Habsburg, although he stated that he would no longer participate in the political affairs of Austria and Hungary, never announced his formal abdication during his lifetime. After Karl's death, his eldest son, Archduke Otto, under the long-term tutelage of his mother, Zita, has been quietly waiting for an opportunity to realize his grand ambitions.</p>
<p>During the time when Dollfuss was in power, Austria spared no effort in suppressing the National Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party. However, Dollfuss's major policies were mostly inclined towards the passive side and lacked any inspiring banner that could curb the invasion of Hitlerism. Except for Otto. In Dollfuss's view, if Otto's restoration movement could be utilized properly, it might refresh the people of Austria and arouse the sympathy of some of the citizens. Since he himself was a devout Catholic and possessed restorationist ideas, he was quite willing to see the restoration of the empire. The reason he did not dare to openly advocate for it was solely due to the international situation, as he did not want to be too conspicuous and cause international disputes. After Dollfuss's death, the leaders of the legitimist faction, Schuschnigg and Prince Starhemberg, succeeded him as Chancellor and Vice Chancellor, respectively. Both of them had previously expressed sympathy for the restoration, and now they could seize the opportunity to realize their aspirations. Therefore, in recent months, the rumor that Otto would return to Austria has become increasingly believable, and it is undoubtedly a prelude to the restoration.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to the facts, the newly promulgated Austrian constitution has already deleted the words "Republic" from the clauses regarding the official name of the country. The provisions prohibiting the Habsburg royal family, which were previously included in the constitution, are also no longer seen. Therefore, Otto's return to the country no longer violates Austrian law. This is undoubtedly helpful for the future of the restoration movement. Moreover, in terms of diplomacy, the Treaty of Saint-Germain did not mention the name of Habsburg. Only the ambassadors' conference on February 4, 1920, and April 1, 1921, twice notified the Austrian and Hungarian governments that the restoration of the Habsburg royal family was firmly opposed by the Allied powers. However, the Austrian restorationists still claim that only Hungary officially recognized the ambassadors' declaration, so it can only bind Hungary's actions and cannot bind Austria.</p>
<p>The attitudes of Italy and the Little Entente are most relevant to the issue of Habsburg restoration. Anyone who is slightly familiar with the international situation knows this. Mussolini pretends to be calm about this issue to show his detachment, but in reality, he never forgets it. Recently, newspapers have frequently reported that Archduke Otto will soon marry Princess Maria of Italy to help promote Italian-Austrian relations. There is much talk about it, and it is not without some possibility. However, Italy's policy depends on France's attitude, and the Paris government is still hesitant. Using the Habsburgs as a buffer to resist the expansion of Hitler's power is something the French would be happy to hear. However, if they openly support Otto's restoration, they will inevitably be suspected of betraying the Little Entente. This is why they must be especially cautious.</p>
<p>The reason why the Little Entente opposes Otto's restoration is very simple. In a nutshell, they fear that once the restoration is completed, a Catholic monarchy will emerge in Central Europe, which will cause the Slovakians of Czechoslovakia, the Croatians of Yugoslavia, and the Transylvanians of Romania to rebel and merge with Austria due to religious reasons. Their opposition is, of course, appropriate. However, today, the Little Entente's anti-Austrian sentiment seems to be less intense than it was in 1921. If Otto were to restore the monarchy, would Czechoslovakia and other countries actually wage war to punish the crimes and cause a terrible war? I dare not predict its certainty.</p>
<p>The situation in Austria is like this, while the situation in Hungary is quite different. One reason is that the Hungarian government officially recognized the resolutions of the two ambassadors' conferences on November 10, 1921, and took it upon itself to oppose the Habsburg restoration. Furthermore, when joining the League of Nations in 1922, it repeatedly recognized this point of international obligation to show that it had no other intentions. Another reason is that the current Regent Horthy and Prime Minister Gömbös both have a deep-seated feud with Zita and Otto, which is insufficient to speak of harmony and cooperation.</p>
<p>However, there is something we must pay attention to. In the current laws of Hungary, there is no provision on who should succeed the Regent. The current Regent Horthy is sixty-six years old and in his twilight years. Once he passes away, only the Council of the League of Nations has the power to oversee the issue of his succession. How the Council of the League of Nations will react to Otto's restoration in Hungary at that time is uncertain. However, judging from the current situation, the possibility of Habsburg activity in Austria is actually greater than in Hungary.</p>

<p>First Landmine Detonates Too Late</p>
<p>Second Landmine Also Discovered</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Army and Japanese Army Engage in Fierce Battle for a Long Time</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today, an anti-Japanese army attempted to bomb a Japanese armored train on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The anti-Japanese army first planted a landmine in the railway track, about ten miles east of Muling or forty miles from the Fifth Station. The armored train was running ahead of the passenger train to Harbin because derailments had occurred frequently on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway in recent weeks, so this was used as protection. The anti-Japanese army apparently misjudged the situation, and the landmine detonated too late; otherwise, the Japanese soldiers on the armored train would have perished together. The explosion of the landmine created a huge crater. The passenger train driver immediately stopped the train upon hearing the sound, but the locomotive fell into the crater. At the same time, the armored train also stopped. The Japanese soldiers on the train immediately fired machine guns to counter the fierce bombing by the anti-Japanese army's rifles. The Japanese guards on the passenger train also joined the defense. The anti-Japanese army eventually could not withstand it and retreated. During the fierce battle between the two sides, the passengers were greatly shaken and all lay down in the train to avoid being hit. Afterwards, the railway track was inspected and another landmine was discovered about a mile west of the first landmine's detonation point, which shows that the anti-Japanese army's deployment was thorough and they were determined to destroy the Japanese train. The second landmine has been defused by the Japanese army's explosives experts. As of 6:00 PM tonight, no news of casualties from the battle between the two sides has been received.

<p>Hailanpao: The Amur State Shipping Bureau and the Harbin Shipping Bureau held a waterway conference in Heihe for two months. Now, both parties have signed a technical agreement on border waterways (including the Heilongjiang River, the Ya'ang River, the Songhua River, the Ussuri River, and Xingkai Lake). The signatories to this agreement were the Director of the Amur State Shipping Bureau from the Soviet side, Meituilizhai, and the Director of the Harbin Shipping Bureau from the "Manchukuo" side, Horiuchi. The agreement stipulates that both parties will jointly set up and maintain navigation markers in the border waterways, and the navigation rules stipulated in the conference should be uniformly observed by vessels from both parties. Izvestia commented on the signing of this agreement, saying, "According to the information we have obtained, the agreement signed in Heihe is not an agreement between two countries. All that is involved are technical issues. However, the signing of this agreement also has its political significance, as this agreement can express the Soviet Union's goodwill and can refute the claims in the Japanese and 'Manchukuo' newspapers that the Soviet authorities stationed on the Manchurian border are deliberately creating trouble and avoiding resolving issues with facts." The newspaper concluded, "In addition, the Heihe agreement can also show that if the Japanese and 'Manchukuo' sides can refrain from their favorite tactics, then all commercial matters can be resolved in a commercial way."

<h3 id="e37">Japan Plans to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) News from Harbin states that the Japanese and "Manchukuo" sides are using the recent train derailment incident on the southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to launch a frenzied anti-Soviet movement, while also conducting destructive propaganda against the Soviet people. The Harbin newspapers have openly promoted the military occupation of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Japanese army's unofficial Russian-language publication, "Harbin Times," claims, "If the Japanese army were to deploy to protect the entire Chinese Eastern Railway line, it would be a shortcut to opening up the situation, because it has now been proven that the Soviet people are indeed colluding with bandits." The Japanese "Harbin News" also had an article saying, "We must seize the Chinese Eastern Railway and protect it with the Japanese army." Regarding this point, if we compare the National News Agency's Changchun telegram stating that "the bandits who attacked the train were very well armed" with the same agency's Harbin report stating that the bandits possessed Japanese Type 38 rifles, it is particularly interesting. Foreigners in Harbin are paying close attention to the speed with which the bandits were captured and the kidnapped passengers (most of whom were Japanese) were released, because the Japanese and "Manchukuo" authorities usually seem powerless against bandits. When people in all circles in Harbin compare these facts with the Japanese propaganda to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, they believe that these attacks are all huge provocations.

<p>A telegram from Harbin states that Harbin newspapers recently claimed that some Japanese and "Manchukuo" figures intend to reorganize the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Japanese Electric Communication Agency's Changchun telegram stated, "The 'Manchukuo' authorities have decided to find a way to reorganize the Chinese Eastern Railway on a large scale." The newspapers clearly indicate that this is a new method discussed by the Japanese and "Manchukuo" sides on how to attack Soviet personnel on the Chinese Eastern Railway and how to oppose the rights granted to the Soviet Union by the Beijing-Fengtian Agreement. A Japanese representative named Sugihara, who was a member of the "Manchukuo" delegation attending the Tokyo railway sale conference, arrived in Harbin from Changchun. He told reporters, "The current state of the Chinese Eastern Railway must be completely changed because the current railway administrative system is not in line with the status of the Empire" (Sugihara clearly referred to "Manchukuo").

<p>(Harbin) On the first day, officials of "Manchukuo" arrested a suspicious person in Jiamusi. After interrogation, it was confirmed that he was an intelligence agent dispatched by the Soviet Far East Military District Command and was an organization that controlled bandits. He had been educated in Bo Li and opened a Chinese medicine store in Jiamusi in June last year. He used four subordinates to investigate the movements of the Japanese army and report to the military command by radio. Under his instructions, he contacted secret intelligence agencies in various parts of northern Manchuria and supplied bandits with radio equipment, machine guns, ammunition, and weapons, which were also controlled by the Red Army. After this discovery, the Soviet secret agencies in various places will be exposed one by one. (Fifth-day Denstu telegram)</p>

After the Japanese and "Manchukuo" officials made every effort to search for them, except for Kawazumi Ainosuke, Ishizaki Umejiro, and Xu Lechen, who are still missing, the other six have been found.

<p>Believed to be Intended to Promote the Eastern European Pact</p>
<p>Increase the Power of the League of Nations to Check Japan and Germany</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is bound to be approved by more than two-thirds of the members at the Council meeting on September 8 and the General Assembly on the 10th. It also reveals its impact on Japan as follows: (1) The Soviet Union's pro-French policy has taken effect, hindering Japanese-French friendship; (2) The Soviet Union has established a Locarno Treaty in Eastern Europe and is bound to advance to East Asia to the border; (3) Negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway will also be permanently stalled because the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations and, according to the League of Nations' resolution, does not recognize the puppet state of "Manchukuo." (Fifth-day China Alliance telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches great importance to the following intentions of the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations: (1) The Eastern European Locarno Treaty, which aims to directly check Germany and indirectly check Japan, has not been able to proceed as intended due to the opposition of small countries. However, after the Soviet Union joins the League of Nations, the establishment of this treaty will be much easier to resolve. Therefore, with the help of France, it attaches importance to the issue of joining the League of Nations, and there is no doubt that it will be able to establish the Eastern European Locarno Treaty immediately after joining. (2) The Soviet Union's purpose in joining the League of Nations is to suppress Germany and check Japan and the puppet state. By achieving these two goals, the Soviet Union will put Japan, which has withdrawn from the League of Nations, in an unfavorable international situation, abandon its previous attitude of belittling the League of Nations, maintain peaceful relations with European countries, and strengthen the role of the League of Nations. However, Japan will not change its established policy because of this. (Fifth-day China Alliance telegram)</p>

<p>Japan is Beset by Financial Difficulties, Russia is Too Busy with Famine Relief</p>
<p>Predicts That War May Not Break Out Immediately</p>
<p>(London) The Times commented today on the Russo-Japanese discord, saying that if the two Western governments presented their hatreds in this attitude and through news methods, the peace of Europe would be in obvious and imminent danger. Neutral countries cannot help but worry about the fact that both Russia and Japan have turned from differences of opinion to genuine anger. However, Japan still has many thorns in Manchuria and may not be willing to attempt to conquer Eastern Siberia next year, which would increase the financial burden on its administrative officials. The Russian oligarchs are too busy with famine relief to be able to mobilize farmers for a large-scale war, so they may not be willing to attack a powerful maritime and land power that is more than 3,000 miles away from their factories and military factories.

<p>(London) According to a report on the progress of civil aviation in 1933 released by the Ministry of Aviation today, British civil aviation has made great progress. The total number of passengers carried throughout the year was 83,100, a three-fold increase compared to 1931.

In addition, the value of gold and silver bullion transported by aircraft in 1933 was £47,238,000, compared to £25,038,000 in the previous year. As for the safety of British civil aviation, it has improved compared to the past. From 1919 to 1924, there was one accident for every 357,000 miles flown, while from 1930 to 1933, it had increased to 2,336,000 miles. (Fourth-day Reuters telegram)</p>

<p>Toronto, Canada: British Admiral Sir Keyes predicted today that Britain may withdraw from the London Naval Treaty. Keyes is a British naval authority and told the Associated Press, "I believe that Britain must break free from the shackles of the London Treaty." He expressed dissatisfaction with Britain binding itself by concluding naval treaties, and added, "France and Italy declared their withdrawal at the time of the London negotiations, which was quite self-aware and are now able to build freely for a reason. Britain, however, is restricted by the treaty and cannot freely build even the pocket battleships recently launched by Germany. Its unreasonable situation is evident. If this continues, the British navy will lag far behind." (Fourth-day National News telegram)</p>

Sir Keyes gave a speech at the Imperial Club today, saying that Britain may abandon the London Naval Convention, and that Britain does not demand the expansion of its navy, but only the right to replenish old warships. Since the signing of the London Naval Convention, Britain has been unable to build warships equal in capability to German pocket battleships, which is a great regret. French Minister of Public Works Florentin, referring to Sir Keyes' speech, said that Britain's maintenance of a strong maritime power is the greatest guarantee for maintaining world peace.

<p>(London) According to the Morning Post, it is rumored in political circles that Prime Minister MacDonald may resign, and the cabinet will therefore be reshuffled. MacDonald has always adhered to internationalism and advocated disarmament. Now, the British government is actively strengthening its national defense, which is contrary to his views. It is a question whether he is still willing to continue presiding over political affairs under such circumstances. Once the cabinet is reshuffled, Foreign Secretary Simon is likely to be assigned to another position, and Secretary of War Hailsham will succeed him. Given the current international situation, the policy of close cooperation between Britain and France is urgent, and Hailsham is the most suitable person to promote this policy.

<p>(Washington) The president of the Electric Boat Company, Charles, testified today before the Senate committee investigating the relationship between US arms manufacturers and foreign firms about the startling news of building submarines. According to him, the Electric Boat Company and the British Vickers Company divided the world into two regions, each occupying exclusive rights to sell submarines and exchanging all shipbuilding patents. He also said that Sir Zaharoff (a European eccentric and one of the richest men) received a 5% commission for the projects that the Electric Boat Company contracted for the Spanish government. Charles also said that the U-boats used by Germany during the European War were created by Germany infringing on a patent owned by the United States. The Electric Boat Company obtained this patent from the Austrian government and had a contract as proof. The Electric Boat Company had demanded compensation of $17 million for the infringement of the patent, but ultimately received nothing. (Fourth-day Reuters telegram)</p>

The first submarine built by Vickers was actually test-driven by the Electric Boat Company. Without the company, the British government would have no submarines to use. As for other remarks, he must consult with others before he can comment. He felt that there was no need to say anything more. (Fifth-day Reuters telegram)</p>

<p>Hitler Delivers Declaration</p>
<p>Revolution Ends, Construction Begins</p>
<p>Strive for Friendship and Peace with Foreign Countries</p>
<p>Nuremberg: The National Socialist Party Congress opened here today. Hitler read a document stating that last year the National Socialist Party's power had reached a solid position, and this year is the period for the National Socialist Party's major construction work. He had to explain that the revolution of the National Socialist Party had fully realized its expectations, because fanatics in the revolution still wanted to expand the scope of possible achievements or deliberately ignored this scope. It must be known that the revolution cannot continue forever, because endless revolutions will lead to great chaos and destroy all economic life in the country. The revolution itself is only secondary, and the most important thing is the purpose of the revolution. The current system must be replaced by a better one. The leaders of the National Socialist movement are the complete masters of Germany, and no one can deny this. The representatives of the National Socialist Party are, of course, the best people in the party in terms of intelligence and creativity. Hitler concluded that National Socialism is a world philosophy. (Fifth-day Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Nuremberg: Hitler delivered a declaration at the Sixth National Socialist Party Congress, which was read by Wagner, the leader of the National Socialist Party in the Bavarian region. The second paragraph of his declaration was a statement of foreign policy, stating that Germany has no grievances and no desire for revenge. What Germany seeks is to live in peace and friendship with its enemies of fifteen years ago. If a second World War were to break out, it would inevitably plunge Europe into communist chaos. The Third Reich, in view of this, is doing everything possible to improve its external relations. However, Germany's call for peace has not been fully understood by the world, but we still do not give up this hope. Our call will eventually be understood by the world. Germany will use all means to defend its honor, independence, and freedom. Germany will never give up the rights of a great power. The reason why Germany withdrew from the League of Nations is that the League of Nations was unwilling to recognize Germany's equal rights. Finally, he reiterated Germany's domestic affairs, saying that the success of Germany's judicial reform in terms of society is unparalleled. In addition, he also mentioned Germany's industrial recovery plan and road construction plan, saying that although German exports have encountered various difficulties, the price of the Mark must be kept stable.

<p>If the plebiscite next year results in a return to Germany, an arbitration court should be established to protect the rights of the people, and Germany should redeem the currency and mineral resources at a fair price.</p>
<p>(Paris) The French memorandum to the Council of the League of Nations regarding the Saar problem has been published. Its content concerns the various measures to be taken after the Saar plebiscite. According to the Treaty of Versailles, the Saar region will be administered by the Administrative Commission of the League of Nations for fifteen years, after which it can either maintain its original status and continue to be managed by the League of Nations, be ceded to France, or be returned to Germany, all of which will be decided by a plebiscite. This French memorandum considers the three possible scenarios separately: (1) If the plebiscite is to maintain the status quo, the French government believes that the people of the Saar should participate in the discussion on how the future system of the Saar region should be organized. (2) If the result of the vote is to cede the Saar region to France, the French government is prepared to announce that under French rule, the people of the Saar will enjoy the same rights as the French people, without discrimination based on race, religion, or language. (3) If it is decided to return the Saar region to Germany, the League of Nations should take the necessary measures to protect the vested rights of the people of the Saar in terms of social insurance and pensions, legally and administratively. The German government can only redeem the francs circulating in the Saar region at a fair price for the purpose of repaying foreign debts, and cannot regard them as German</p>

<p>property. As for the mineral resources operated by the French government in the Saar region, if the Saar region is returned to Germany, Germany should redeem them from France at a fair price. If the status quo is maintained, there will be no legal problem. However, the French government is well aware that mineral resources are the key to the entire economy of the Saar region. If they continue to be operated by France, it may not be compatible with the new organization after the Saar plebiscite. Therefore, it is prepared to cede most of the mineral resources to the Saar region under fair conditions. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Barthou submitted a memorandum to the League of Nations, proposing that if the result of the plebiscite in the Saar region next year is to return the Saar region to Germany, an arbitration court of mixed nationality should be established. The French government makes this proposal because it believes that in order to ensure the safety of voters and protect the rights of residents regarding property and monetary contracts, more thorough measures must be taken. The memorandum also suggests that in order to avoid long-term delays, France and Germany should agree on a draft agreement regarding the price of Saar minerals, so that when the plebiscite approves the return of the Saar region to Germany, Germany must pay the price of the minerals to France according to this draft agreement. The price of the minerals must be paid in cash before the mineral resources can be accepted. If the result of the vote is to maintain the status quo, France is willing to hand over most of the mineral resources to the Saar local authorities under appropriate conditions.

She also said that the Salvation Army's doctrine of saving souls would not change.

<p>If it Extends Beyond January</p>
<p>The U.S. Market Will Be Seized by Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) About half of the national textile industry is participating in the strike. If the strike extends beyond January, there is a risk that part of the U.S. textile industry's market will be seized by Japan. Sloan, president of the American Cotton Manufacturers Association, said in New York today that there would not be a shortage of goods for the time being, because the factories have enough inventory to meet the usual demand for four weeks. However, if the strike extends beyond four weeks, Japanese exporters can take part of the U.S. market and replace them. According to an Associated Press survey, about 50% are participating in the strike, with Connecticut being the most consistent, accounting for about 80%. There are 100,000 strikers in Pennsylvania, and 60,000 are still working as usual. In North and South Carolina, there are 750 textile factories, and only 225 are on strike. In general, there are more cotton mills than other factories, and silk mills have not responded at all. According to the leader of the United Textile Workers of America, the strike has been very successful. However, yesterday he said that 600,000 people participated, but today it has been reduced to 300,000. Judging from reports from all parties, the number of strikers is far less than the union claims. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(New York) The textile industry strike involves 1.25 million people, but there are actually many people working as usual, so those who have gone on strike are quite resentful, and there are fears of riots and bloodshed. Although today's report shows a large increase in the number of strikers, the estimate is still less than half of the total. Pickets appeared in New England and the Southern cotton region today, but they were peaceful. There have been a few minor conflicts between strikers and factory police. Governor Lehman of New York State said today that the government cannot provide relief to those who are not currently working, and that requests for relief must be studied separately. The strikers were discouraged by this statement. It is estimated that there are 50,000 strikers and 75,000 non-strikers in New England. In North and South Carolina, the number of strikers and non-strikers are about equal, at 80,000 each. 10,000 workers in the St. Louis cotton clothing industry and 5,000 in Kansas City have all received strike notices. Gorman, chairman of the strike committee, said today that he was very pleased that the textile workers obeyed orders and went on strike enthusiastically. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

No disturbances have occurred so far. It is expected that the government will submit the wage dispute to arbitration. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations between Tokyo Municipal Tram labor and management broke down. The union issued a strike order on the evening of the 4th, and all employees went on a general strike at 4:30 a.m. on the 5th. Temporary employees of the authorities drove the trams, and buses also ran temporarily. The Metropolitan Police Department dispatched a large number of police officers for serious security. The atmosphere is still calm. The Tokyo Tram Employees' General Strike reserve fund has reached tens of thousands of yuan. Each employee lives in his dormitory to maintain order. The municipal authorities temporarily recruited 2,000 employees to drive trams. In this era of unemployment, the news that 2,000 employees were recruited spread, and the city's unemployed army rushed to the Electric Power Bureau. Drivers and ticket sellers in Japanese and Western clothes immediately took up their duties. At this time, most of the temporary employees had no experience. They did not stop where they should, and stopped where they should not. The ticket sellers did not know the names of the stations. A triple collision of trams occurred near Manseibashi, causing passengers to realize the danger to their lives. This was the situation on the first day of the strike.

<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Believes It Violates the Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Iwate, the acting ambassador to Italy, on the 5th, stating that the Italian government had sent a letter to the embassy, stating that based on the reasons stated in the letter, it had decided on the 2nd to implement a distribution import system for Japanese goods such as eyeglasses, celluloid toys, and combs by order. The notice was received on the 4th. Although the eyeglasses item did not specify a distribution fee, it was explained that if Japan requested it, it would be considered in good faith. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believed that this measure by the Italian government violated the most-favored-nation treatment recognized by the treaty, that is, the absolute treatment stipulated in Article 9 of the Japan-Italy Treaty of Commerce regarding the prohibition of import and restriction of import should be eliminated. Therefore, the implementation of the above-mentioned distribution system for Japanese goods this time is recognized as a clear violation of the treaty. The letter notified by the Italian government also clearly stated that the Italian government, in view of the importance of Japanese goods imports, agreed to deal fairly with them in the past, and then implemented the distribution system, which is quite unreasonable. It has now telegraphed Iwate, the acting ambassador to Italy, to demand an explanation from the Italian government based on reason. (Japan United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Not Caused by Toxins</p>
<p>Research by German Medical Scientists</p>
<p>(Berlin) The discovery of tumor bacteria by Dr. Bremer, director of the Dahlem Biological Research Institute near Berlin, Germany, has been reported in various newspapers, but the details are unclear and a restatement is necessary. Dr. Bremer's report was completed two years ago. The reason for the delay in publishing it was that Dr. Bremer's experimental results had to be reviewed by several well-known German experts, which took a lot of time. According to Dr. Bremer's research, it has been proven that tumors are not caused by toxins, as previously believed, but are indeed a microbial disease. Dr. Bremer has also been able to extract these tumor bacteria from the red blood cells of patients, isolate them, and examine their development process. These bacteria are most suitable for a soda-like environment, so it can be known why the elderly are more susceptible to this disease. According to the "acidic basic average" experiment, it is proven that the older the age, the more the average of acidity and alkalinity is affected, because the alkalinity in the blood of the elderly is excessively increased. Although Bremer inoculated the isolated tumor bacteria into the bodies of mice, the mice soon developed obvious tumorous diseases, with sarcomas being the most visible, and true strains can be extracted from these sarcomas. However, after publishing Dr. Bremer's research report, Professor Schilling stated that whether the occurrence of this sarcoma is indeed a tumorous sarcoma still needs to be proven in the future. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since the shocking news of German bacteriologist Dr. Bremer's discovery of tumor bacteria was released, Bremer published an article this morning stating that he and his assistant Dr. Hamann have cured many people. Dr. Bremer has not only cured early-stage tumors in Berlin and Paris, but also more severe tumor diseases. Dr. Hamann has cured about 60 patients using Dr. Bremer's method.

<p>(Hangzhou) The person in charge of the National Silkworm Improvement Association stated that with the weather improving, the prospects for the autumn silkworm season are now optimistic. Zhejiang Province is expected to harvest 100,000 loads of cocoons. This year, Zhejiang Province is conducting its first trial of autumn silkworm rearing, and plans to conduct large-scale rearing again next autumn. However, current silk prices are extremely low. In addition to Zhejiang Province planning to spin silk and weave silk on its own, the Association is also planning to establish a large-scale Jiangzhe joint silk spinning factory. In the future, it is planned to be jointly operated by officials and merchants, or entirely by merchants, with the government only in a supervisory role. This has not yet been determined and is expected to be established in December or January. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e97">President Wang Attends Telecommunications Conference and Delivers Instructions <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News: The telecommunications conference convened by the Ministry of Communications opened yesterday (the 4th) at 9:00 AM. Those present included Zhu Jiahe, Minister of the Ministry; Zhang Daofan, Vice Minister; Yang Ziyi, Chief Secretary; Wang Fuyi, Counselor; Yan Renguang, Shen Shihua, Gao Tingzi, and Lou Guanglai, Directors; Lu Rongguang, Chief Accountant; Yu Senwen, Director of the Workers' Union; Mao Gongxiang and Chen Dajing, Secretaries; Yin Guoyong, Section Chief of the Telecommunications Department; Huang Renhao, Wen Yuqing, and Yan Gantang, Heads of Local Bureaus; and Chen Shaoxian, Secretary of the Conference, totaling 130 people. President Wang arrived slightly late due to attending a meeting of the Executive Yuan. The meeting was called to order at 9:00 AM with the ringing of a bell. After formalities, Chairman Zhu Jiahe delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Vice Minister Zhang Daofan. Director Yan Ren first reported on the preparations. Subsequently, Advisor Lang Ge, Counselor Wang Fuyi, and Bureau Chiefs Wen Yuqing and Gu Deming delivered speeches in succession. After President Wang arrived, he was immediately requested to deliver instructions and then a photograph was taken. A preparatory meeting was then held, followed by the election of members of various review groups, which were divided into six groups for review. The review meeting continued in the afternoon, and the formal meeting began today. The instructions of President Wang are recorded below.</p>
<p>President Wang's instructions: Chairman, comrades, the Executive Yuan meeting started at eight o'clock this morning and only ended now, so I apologize for my late arrival. Two days ago, a postal conference was held here. On the day the postal conference opened, I came here to say a few words, and I saw many responsible officials from the postal sector gathered together. Today is the telecommunications conference, and I see many responsible officials from the telecommunications sector gathered together. I am very pleased to see this, and I have the same hopes for the telecommunications conference as I did for the postal conference. On the day the postal conference opened a few days ago, I said that since the national crisis, various construction projects have been striving for progress in the face of difficulties, and the most successful ones have been the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways. Postal and telecommunications are important state-owned enterprises under the Ministry of Communications, and they have both struggled through various difficulties. Postal services have suffered damage, and telecommunications have suffered the same. Postal services have felt hardship, and telecommunications have felt the same. These two important state-owned enterprises, both under difficult circumstances and suffering great damage, have achieved their current success thanks to the efforts and struggles of Minister Zhu and all the responsible personnel in the face of national crises and other natural and man-made disasters. Telecommunications is a very specialized industry, and I lack that specialized knowledge, so I don't have much to contribute. However, I have a few ordinary and simple words to say to everyone. We all know that telecommunications has not developed much since the Republic. The reason for this lack of development is insufficient economy, and the reason for insufficient economy is poor business. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications is seeking reasonable economic progress and has adopted a cash concentration system. The economic situation of telecommunications now has greatly improved compared to the past, and thanks to the efforts of Minister Zhu and everyone, many other systems have also been improved. The telecommunications industry is a state-owned enterprise; to be precise, it is a state-owned business. However, the telecommunications industry is often subjected to an obstruction and oppression, namely the devastation of military and political organs, which prevents telecommunications from fully developing. I think this must be an important issue to be discussed at the telecommunications conference. I believe that the Ministry of Communications will do its best to find a solution to this problem, and other organs will certainly be able to help. I am willing to cooperate with everyone to the best of my ability so that the opinions contributed by everyone at this conference can be realized. Originally, the telecommunications industry could have been a very prosperous industry, but the reason why it has not been able to fully develop since the Republic is the influence of military and political affairs. In the past, telecommunications had become a form of military warlord separatism, turning the entire industry into fragmented pieces. An industry that could have prospered has become a dilapidated industry, and the future of telecommunications has been greatly affected and hit hard. This is all because the military and political organs do not understand that the telecommunications industry is a business. Secondly, since the invention of radio, a major problem has arisen between wired and wireless telecommunications. We all know that Marconi's invention of radio was a very important contribution to transportation. However, wired and wireless telecommunications seem to have become a state of opposition, as if they are incompatible. In fact, wired and wireless telecommunications each have their own uses and their own positions. As an example, when Special Envoy Huang Musong went to Tibet this time, from Sichuan to Tibet, the entire route was high mountains and ridges, and wired telecommunications were naturally impossible. Because a wireless transceiver was brought along, we were able to communicate news at any time and receive systematic reports. Otherwise, we would not have received any news at this time. Therefore, we can see that wireless telecommunications can make up for the shortcomings of wired telecommunications. However, the situation of wireless telecommunications is now very chaotic. Various provinces and organs are now setting up their own radio stations, and there are also privately set up radio stations in the concessions. We should also find ways to rectify and improve this chaotic system so that both wired and wireless telecommunications can develop systematically. This may also be an important issue to be discussed at this conference. At this telecommunications conference, everyone has put forward many proposals. I believe that after this conference, on the one hand, everyone will contribute their opinions, and on the other hand, everyone will also express the difficulties they have encountered in their work as much as possible. In this way, not only can the Ministry of Communications adopt everyone's opinions and implement them separately, but the difficulties that everyone has encountered can also be resolved. We all know that the biggest difficulty faced by telecommunications is the strong oppression of military and political organs. For example, since the Republic, it has often been seen that the telegrams of important military and political figures are often as long as one or two thousand words, and these one or two thousand words are not important sentences, but elaborate parallel prose. This situation really causes the telegraph operators to suffer a lot. Originally, long telegrams are not necessarily impossible to send, but they must be because it is necessary to explain the ins and outs of a matter and there is no other choice. However, the drafted manuscript should still be revised to make the text as concise as possible. This is not only to take into account the difficulty of telegraph operators sending telegrams, but also especially to save national expenses. I believe that if all military and political organs can think of this, the operating income of telecommunications will be considerable. Moreover, there are two sentences that I often say: First, the nationalization of the army and national defense; second, the commercialization of state-owned enterprises. If the army can become the national armed force and a sharp tool for national defense, then it is a true army. If state-owned enterprises can be commercialized, then they become true productive enterprises. A state-owned enterprise is the lifeblood of the country and the life of the nation, so losses in state-owned enterprises are also losses to the country and the nation. Therefore, these enterprises must be made unified and fully state-owned enterprises, and they must be commercialized. In the future, this type of operation should be done according to the rules of operation. In the past, telecommunications often suffered inexplicable losses. Hard-won construction was destroyed by a sudden storm, causing the responsible authorities to feel disappointed and the enthusiastic staff to feel discouraged. These various disappointments and discouragements will surely be reported as much as possible at this conference. The destruction by military and political organs should make them understand that damage to state-owned enterprises is also damage to their own interests, so they should cooperate fully. The Executive Yuan will certainly do its best to help. Now, I hope that you will speak out about the problems in telecommunications and the external oppression without any concerns. Everyone should speak out about the pain they feel with a spirit of great fearlessness, and reform past mistakes with a spirit of great fearlessness. I hope that everyone will speak out sincerely and that everyone will reform sincerely. (5th)</p>

<h3 id="e100">Nanchang City Work Plan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>After the General Association was formally established, it informed the New Movement Associations in various provinces and cities to reorganize, and actively planned the promotion work in Nanchang City. The content of the plan includes eight major categories: (1) Measures for government agencies to implement the new lifestyle; (2) Measures for public places to implement the new lifestyle; (3) Measures for stores to implement the new lifestyle; (4) Measures for public utilities to implement the new lifestyle; (5) Measures for city appearance improvement; (6) Measures for factories to implement the new lifestyle; (7) Measures for social organizations to implement the new lifestyle; (8) Preparations for reforming etiquette and customs. The work procedure is that the Investigation Section first investigates various situations and provides the results for the Design Section to use as a reference. Then, the Design Section formulates various implementation measures for the work, which are submitted for approval and then handed over to the Promotion Section for implementation. It is reported that in the past month, the work of each section that has already begun includes "Investigation of Wedding and Funeral Customs in Nanchang City" by the Investigation Section; and the drafting of various measures to implement the new lifestyle movement by the Design Section, divided into the following twenty-three items: (1) Inns and public offices; (2) Teahouses and restaurants; (3) Entertainment venues; (4) Bathhouses; (5) Barber shops; (6) Highways, automobiles, and stations; (7) Vegetable markets; (8) Improvement of public toilets; (9) Rickshaw pullers; (10) Cold food stores and ice shops; (11) Butchers; (12) Tofu shops; (13) Stores; (14) Cleaning of street walls; (15) Street vendors; (16) Docks; (17) Road safety knowledge; (18) General equipment knowledge for social organizations; (19) Training methods for store employees to implement the new lifestyle; (20) Training methods for factory workers to implement the new lifestyle; (21) Training methods for female domestic workers to implement the new lifestyle; (22) Principles for the first phase of the New Movement in various provinces and cities; (23) Principles for the first phase of the New Movement in various counties of Jiangxi. For the Promotion Section, these include convening talks with leaders of various industrial and commercial sectors, and participating in discussion meetings on implementing the new lifestyle in various trade associations and labor unions. Important departments include opening training classes for female domestic workers, guiding the activities of the Youth Service Corps, and deciding that each store should appoint one person as a service member, expanding publicity in the industrial sector, and correcting various ingrained habits.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Achievements in Promoting the New Movement in Nanchang <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Since the General Association was reorganized and established, the work of the New Movement in Nanchang has shifted from the initial creation and development stage to the planning and implementation stage. Therefore, publicity work has been greatly reduced, such as civic rallies, lantern rallies, and slogan speeches, which are no longer common. The emphasis is now on how to implement and how to execute. Although there has been no precise statistics on the effectiveness of this promotion in the past few months, the following can be observed in daily life: (1) People walking shirtless in the city have disappeared. Previously, a foreigner named Ding Kelan walked shirtless in the street and refused to stop after being warned by the military police, and the authorities have ordered him to leave the country. This is a very significant event. (2) Military police still conduct inspections on the streets, dissuading those who do not fasten their buttons or do not follow the path. The orderliness of the bustling streets is indeed more progressive than before and the situation in major cities. (3) The practice of giving gifts and hosting banquets in various government agencies has decreased. For example, it is stipulated that military and political figures cannot spend more than two yuan on gifts and cannot spend more than five yuan on banquets. Although this is due to the strict prohibition by the highest authorities, it is also the effect of the promotion of the New Life Movement. (4) The practice of large-scale sales and auctions in various stores has decreased, and there are many signs outside saying "Honest price reduction, no false discounts." (5) Hotel and restaurant waiters mostly wear white cloth clothes, know to pay attention to cleanliness, and are more polite than before. (6) The Municipal Council has formulated regulations on patriotic meals for restaurants, stipulating that the highest price cannot exceed ten yuan, and each person uses two pairs of chopsticks and two spoons. Most restaurants comply with these regulations. (7) Young people smoking cigarettes on the streets have disappeared. (8) Barber shops know to use disinfectant, and butchers know to use wire mesh covers. (9) Most public toilets have been improved one after another. Advertising signs and posting signs are all over the city, and the city appearance is very clean. (10) Social gambling has been especially reduced. (September 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Ma Yinchu's Speech in Hankou <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>丨The Silver Problem and Prize Savings丨</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hankou Special Municipality Party Affairs Rectification Committee invited Mr. Ma Yinchu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, to give a public speech on the afternoon of the 4th. His speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Prize Savings: "Chairman, distinguished guests, I am very honored to have the opportunity to speak here today. The 11th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society was held in Changsha. Having witnessed the situation in Hunan Province, I feel that there is great hope, but the lack of capital is the biggest problem in Hunan. However, this is the economic problem of the entire China, and it is not only the case in Hunan. Most of China's existing capital is concentrated in the nine major cities of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Hankou, etc., with Shanghai being the most prominent. Currently, Shanghai has approximately 400 million banknotes, 500 million in silver, and 2.1 billion in deposits. As a result, Shanghai suffers from inflation, while the interior suffers from anemia. Recently, the banking industry in Shanghai, due to the decline of Chinese industry, the bureaucratization and familialization of factory management laws, dares not invest in factories again, and cannot use its capital to engage in speculative businesses such as buying and selling public bonds and land. Because this kind of speculation can only be profitable when gold prices rise and fall sharply. Now that the value of public bonds is stable, this kind of speculation is not feasible. Nor can they use their capital to buy land, because the value of land in Shanghai is declining day by day. Therefore, those with capital are turning their funds to the United States for speculative business. There are now six major companies in Shanghai specializing in this kind of business. Every evening, the lights are bright, the phones are busy, and the business is very prosperous. Last year alone, their total profit reached more than 50 million. However, this kind of speculation is very risky. Today, it is unfortunate that 50 million could be lost. The United States losing 50 million is nothing, but China losing 50 million will plunge its finances into a desperate situation. Moreover, if capital is concentrated in Shanghai, the interior will be empty, and the rural areas will be impoverished. Our country is an import-dependent country and must export silver every year. Therefore, the financial situation in the interior will inevitably become increasingly exhausted. In the event of a second world war, if the enemy threatens Shanghai with its artillery fire and does not allow the use of reserve funds from various bank notes, it will be enough to turn all the banknotes we own into waste paper. If we resist, the economic center of Shanghai can easily be destroyed by artillery fire, causing panic in our rear and making it impossible to maintain. Therefore, the concentration of silver in Shanghai is indeed a great danger. The reason why silver is concentrated in Shanghai is also due to the prize savings of the International Savings Society and the Sino-French Savings Society. This is the biggest reason. As for the prize savings scam to defraud the people's money, that is another secondary issue. The Premier's legacy lies in utilizing foreign capital to develop domestic industry and commerce, while savings societies go against this, using our domestic capital to increase the power of foreign capital, and giving our people's money to foreigners to build foreign houses in the Shanghai concessions. The current savings methods of the International Savings Society are divided into monthly savings of three yuan, six yuan, twelve yuan, etc. The maximum is twelve yuan per month, which must be paid for fourteen years. If one month is not paid, the right to win a prize will be lost, and there is no interest. Paying twelve yuan per month, after fourteen years, no matter which bank you deposit in, you can get 4,831 yuan in principal and interest, while the savings society only gets 2,000 yuan, a difference of more than 2,800 yuan. The savings society uses about 1,000 yuan of this 2,800 yuan as a prize, and the rest is exploited by it. This is one reason. The lottery for prizes by the savings society is held in Shanghai. There is no supervisory organization such as a supervisory committee, and it is difficult for depositors to inquire. What the truth is is ultimately unknown. This is another reason. However, this is still a personal issue. We must consider the future of the entire Chinese economy, oppose the concentration of inland capital in Shanghai, and should disperse Shanghai's funds to the rural areas. If capital flows into the rural areas, the purchasing power of farmers will be strong, urban industry and commerce will develop, and if the rural economy prospers, the enemy's planes and artillery can threaten or destroy a few of our cities, but cannot control our entire rural area. This is the reason why I oppose the prize savings.</p>
<p>The Silver Problem: As for the silver problem, it has a deep relationship with the prize savings and can be combined into a whole problem. Our country uniquely uses the silver standard, while other countries mostly use the gold standard. Since the United States nationalized silver, the price of silver has risen day by day, which has greatly affected us. Before the United States absorbed silver, the ratio of gold to silver was 72 to 1. Now the United States has raised it to 16 to 1. The calculation is as follows: one ounce of silver can be exchanged for one yuan and two jiao nine of paper money, but the casting fee is 50%, so it becomes six mao four fen five of paper money. Half of it is used as its casting fee, but paper money has a market price, and six mao four fen five of paper money is worth six mao nine of gold, that is, one ounce of silver gets three mao nine of gold. As a result, the ratio of gold to silver becomes 51 to 1, that is, one ounce of silver is only worth three mao nine of gold. The formation of this phenomenon has two kinds of causes, near and far, and the near cause can be divided into three, namely (1) The Democratic Party is now in power in the United States. The party has a close relationship with the silver mining capitalists in the United States, so it must raise the price of silver to help its power expand. (2) Prices in the United States have been declining recently, and many factories have closed down, so silver must be used to replace gold, so that the price of gold will fall and prices will rise. (3) The United States wants to increase its exports to our country and compete with Japan's economic power in China, so it raises the price of silver, so that the Chinese can buy more American goods, so that American goods can exclude Japanese goods. As for the distant reasons, there are two. According to my speculation, the United States believes that raising the price of silver will inevitably cause the silver existing in foreign banks to be sold back to the United States. Therefore, China will lack silver, and the countryside will panic. Banknotes must be used to redeem silver, and the remaining silver must be collected. As silver flows out of the country on the one hand, and is collected by people on the other, the result will inevitably be that no silver can be seen at all. The United States then takes the opportunity to lend us silver, just like the previous loan of 100 million silver, to seize the economic lifeline of our country. China has about 200 million silver, and about 50 million exists in Shanghai. According to customs statistics, our silver exports have reached 130 million this year. In the future, after the foreign banks' silver is transported abroad, they will then misappropriate it from Chinese banks. Because of the relationship of import dependency, we have no way to resist, so the Shanghai banking community is short of silver and must misappropriate it from the interior, so that all the silver in the Chinese countryside flows overseas. This is the US policy of raising the price of silver to exclude Japanese goods in China, but I believe that this is impossible. The dumping of Japanese goods in China is not like the previous investment in China. Now Japan exchanges goods for silver, and then sells the silver to the United States to make a profit, and also uses silver to buy raw materials from the United States, such as cotton, which is manufactured in Japan, and then dumps the goods in China, and then sells the silver obtained to the United States, and continues the same buying and selling business. As a result, Japanese goods have not been defeated by American goods, but the United States has been restrained by Japan. The general public in our country has two strategies for rescuing this crisis: (1) Levying silver export tax; (2) Prohibiting silver exports. Those who advocate the former believe that once taxes are levied, silver will not be exported, but I do not think so, because the United States absorbs silver to raise the price of silver, which is a slow process, not a sudden increase in the price of silver. If we levy taxes, the foreign banks' silver will be exported first, and collected in Hong Kong, which is tax-free. When we levy 3%, the silver will be transported to Hong Kong. When we levy taxes to 15%, the silver collected in Hong Kong must be transferred to the United States, and we can earn 12% interest on the silver tax. Therefore, the export tax is useless. As for prohibiting exports, it is also not a solution, because China is an import-dependent country and cannot but export silver. If we buy gold to repay, the price of gold has already risen, and it will not be cost-effective. As for the best way, I believe that the financial authorities should use a clear head, honest administration, concentrate silver, issue banknotes that are not redeemable in law, and pay for foreign goods with banknotes. All necessities of clothing, food, housing, etc., can be replaced by domestic goods. As for the "airplane" and "locomotive" machines in the "travel" aspect, they cannot be purchased with banknotes. Gasoline can be replaced by alcohol. As for clothing, food, and housing, the inflow of foreign goods into China cannot get silver for export, and it is bound to transport our country's products back, and exchange goods for goods. We can not worry about the seriousness of the silver problem. However, this kind of rescue strategy has a close relationship with the prize savings. The US silver policy and the International Savings Society are both economic aggression against us by imperialism. If our country does not ban prize savings, today's International Savings Society will be the second East India Company, and the silver problem will also be unsolvable. I hope that all compatriots and party and government authorities will pay attention to it and urge the government to pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Dispute over the Wasteland Dam in Wuxi Expands <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Villagers in Gushan Township, Jiangyin County, crossed the border to demolish the wasteland dam in Chenshu Town, triggering a major dispute. The Construction Department only relied on Engineer Wang's speculative report on water level and hastily approved the opening of the dam. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, considering the high morale of the people in Chenshu Town, could not dissuade them, fearing other changes, telegraphed the Construction Department to send personnel for detailed investigation and to punish Zhou Weisan, the town leader of Gushan. Yesterday's news came, and it turned into an accident. The villagers in Chenshu Town, indignant at the violence of Jiangyin and the deception of the Construction Department, felt that justice was difficult to manifest, so they voluntarily gathered a few days ago and restored the dam to its original state. Unexpectedly, yesterday at about 11:00 am, Gushan Town Leader Zhou Weisan, upon hearing that the dam had been repaired, led hundreds of farmers, carrying farm tools, to the barren dam and demolished the dam without permission, and even wider than before. Workers were also sent to Chenshu Town to cause trouble with hidden iron rulers. All the shops and residents in the town panicked and closed their doors, and the situation was serious, as if Qin and Yue were facing each other. Nearby villagers, upon hearing the news, were filled with injustice and came out to stop them, causing conflicts and fights between the two sides for a long time, and were seriously injured. Chenshu Town Leader Zhou Zihua, upon hearing the news, telegraphed Zhao District Leader to report the conflict and damage situation to County Magistrate Yan for verification. At the same time, Town Leader Zhou felt that the morale of the people was high and he could not dissuade them, deeply feeling that his intelligence was exhausted and he could not cope. Yesterday, he also submitted a report to the county government, requesting reprimand and resigning from his position. County Magistrate Yan has telegraphed the situation to the provincial office for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Famous Bandit Hu Zufan of Zhenjiang is Captured <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Hu Zufan, a famous bandit leader in the Yili area, has been colluding with hooligans and organizing knife societies since 1927, engaging in racketeering and robbery in the border area of Jiangsu and Anhui, committing all kinds of evil. After many arrests by Yang Wei, the commander of Yixing (i.e., the commander of the 3rd Security Regiment), he was finally escaped and fled to Lishui. Recently, taking advantage of the famine victims搶米, he secretly returned from Lishui to encourage the famine victims, hoping to stir up trouble. After receiving the report, the company immediately remained silent and went to arrest him. When they arrived, they saw the bandit leading his accomplices, one with a steel knife, lying under a towering tree. The soldiers swarmed up and captured him. Another bandit, awakened from his dream, turned and fled, and was shot dead on the spot.</p>

<p>The German Minister Rushes from Ping to Attend</p>
<p>The large Junkers JU-52 aircraft newly arrived by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, piloted by the famous German aviation pioneer Baron Gebelenz and Mr. Ontot, departed from Berlin on the 29th of last month, taking the route through the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian coast, flying to China. It arrived in Ruopur, India, at 12:00 noon on the 2nd of this month, flew to Bangkok at 5:00 pm on the 4th, and arrived in Guangzhou at 5:30 pm yesterday. It is scheduled to depart from Guangzhou this morning. If it does not encounter a hurricane on the way, it will arrive at Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai at 5:00 pm today. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation has been preparing for the welcome for days and has issued more than 1,000 invitations, inviting Chinese and foreign dignitaries to attend. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Chairman Yu of the Chamber of Commerce will also be present to deliver speeches. German Minister to China Dr. Toddmann will also arrive in Shanghai from Ping today to participate in the welcome. The company has three buses available at the Customs Wharf at 4:00 pm today, and two more at Jing'an Temple. People from all walks of life who have received the company's invitation can go to ride for free. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. According to the spokesperson of the company, the nature of this aircraft's arrival in China is different from the previous demonstration flights, and it is not for the purpose of making any records. However, this kind of large aircraft has not been seen in China before. Now, the German Hansa Company has specially sent aviation pioneers to fly it here to enhance the friendship of national diplomacy, so there is this warm welcome. In addition, the aircraft flew according to the planned route this time, without any obstacles on the way, and the original landing points were all arrived on time, which is also of great record value.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Social Affairs Bureau Announces a Limit on the Highest Rice Price <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Severe Punishment for Any Under-the-Table Price Increases Found</p>
<p>Based on the request of the Food Committee to limit rice prices to no more than 13.5 yuan, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau issued an announcement yesterday and notified all rice merchants. The original text reads: "Recently, although rice prices in the city have risen sharply due to the scarcity of rice arriving in Shanghai, in fact, rice merchants cannot avoid manipulating and hoarding, resulting in an increase of nearly onefold in the price per stone compared with last year's rice prices. If restrictions are not strictly enforced, it will affect the food supply of the people. Now, the Food Committee of this city has submitted a report, proposing to limit the maximum price of japonica rice to no more than 13.5 yuan per stone, and medium-quality rice will be priced separately, requesting that an announcement be made for implementation. After reviewing the report, it is deemed feasible. In addition to reporting and issuing orders for compliance, it is urgently announced that the highest price of special grade japonica rice in this city shall not exceed 13.5 yuan per stone, and medium-quality rice will be priced separately. If there is any non-compliance, or any under-the-table price increases, severe punishment will be imposed once verified. You should all be aware of this and hereby announce it."</p>

<h3 id="e111">Liu Luyin Went to Beijing Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After Visiting Wang, He Went to Jiangxi to Visit Jiang</p>
<p>He Expressed His Feelings on the Revival of Germany and Italy</p>
<p>Liu Luyin, the Chinese minister to Italy, returned to China the other day and arrived in Shanghai. At 9:00 am yesterday, he visited Song Ziwen, standing member of the National Economic Commission, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, and Yang Hu, Director of the Security Office. He returned to his residence in the afternoon and received visiting reporters, and talked about his impressions in Germany and Italy. According to Liu, he has been abroad for almost three years, including two years in Germany and only nine months in Italy. During this period, he deeply felt that the spirit of national revival in Germany and Italy can be used as a reference. He believes that for the revival of a country, the following two points must be paid attention to: (1) The problem of system. Although the systems of various countries are different, they all have their strengths and weaknesses. We may as well take their strengths and abandon their weaknesses to suit the national conditions and use them for adjustment. (2) The problem of people. We can take Italian Prime Minister Mussolini as a model. In my observation, Mussolini's actions are like Zhuge Wuhou in the Three Kingdoms period of our country. His spirit of doing things can be described as "devoting himself to the task until his dying day, indifferent to fame and fortune." No matter how difficult it is, he will move forward bravely, and his governance is especially clear and honest. He is truly a model hero. Therefore, if the whole country can unanimously emulate Mussolini's spirit, then the future of revival can be expected. Liu took the night train to Beijing at 11:00 pm last night to meet with Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, and then went to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Jiang to report on the international situation, stay in Lu for a short time, and then return to his hometown of Wuxue to bury his grandmother.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Six Special Commissioners from the Jin Provincial Government Will Go Abroad Regularly <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Investigating Coking and Steelmaking</p>
<p>Returning to China in About One Year</p>
<p>In order to develop industry and construction throughout the province, the Shanxi Provincial Government has specially sent six people, including Qin Wenai and Dong Fengxian, to Europe and the United States to investigate coking and steelmaking technologies. Mr. Qin and others have already arrived in Shanghai one after another and will take the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso to go abroad on the 11th. A reporter from Dabaisha specially visited them and recorded the following:</p>
<h3 id="e113">Going Abroad Regularly <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>According to Qin Wenai, the investigators sent by the Shanxi Provincial Government this time are Suo Wen, Wang Rongting, Dong Fengxian, and myself. There are also Zhu Mumei and Dong Weihan, who were recruited by the Provincial Government as students to study abroad. They have already arrived in Shanghai one after another and are handling the procedures for going abroad. They will take the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso to go abroad on the 11th of this month and go directly to Venice to land.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Purpose of Investigation <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the investigation is to focus on various technologies of coking and steelmaking. Because Shanxi has abundant reserves of coal, iron, and ore, to develop Shanxi industry, it is necessary to first set up two factories for coking and steelmaking. Therefore, after arriving in Italy, Suo Wen and I will go to Germany to investigate the steelmaking industry, and at the same time, we will also investigate electrical and municipal knowledge for about six or seven months. If it is not enough, it will be extended to one year before returning to China.</p>
<p>Jin Province Construction</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation in Jin Province, it is quite stable, but it is waiting for the development of construction. Factories such as coking and steelmaking are urgently needed to be established, but due to economic relations, it is difficult to realize them immediately. However, the authorities are actively planning, and generally speaking, they will proceed step by step after the investigation team returns to China. Other constructions in Jin Province in recent years have not made significant progress due to limited funds. However, the Ordnance Factory has been manufacturing daily necessities with excellent results since it was abolished as a factory. Given some time, it may develop further.</p>

<p>Central News Agency said that Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Beijing at 7:30 am on the 5th and went to the Jiangnan Shipyard to rest. Then, he went to Fuchu Road to visit the illness of Li Shijia, member of the Fujian Provincial Government and commander of the port fortress. Li's stomach ailment has gradually improved since he was diagnosed and treated at Renji Hospital. He was discharged from the hospital on the evening of the 4th and returned to his residence, but he still needs to see a doctor every day, so the date of his return to Fujian will be after he has fully recovered.</p>

<p>Central News Agency said that Zhongwei Liu Luyin arrived in Shanghai on the Empress of Canada on the 26th of last month with his family and checked into rooms 726, 27, and 29 of the Yangtze Hotel, using the alias Dong Guoren. After being discovered by reporters, he changed his surname to Wu. He has been very busy socializing with Zhongwei in Shanghai for days. Because his whereabouts are secret and he refused reporters' interviews, the details could not be obtained. It is now known that Liu has checked out of the rooms he opened in the Yangtze Hotel the other night. It is still difficult to confirm whether he has left Shanghai to return south or has found another residence. As for Liu's plan to take advantage of his stay in Shanghai to go to Beijing, it is not confirmed news.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Domestic Goods Manufacturers Discuss Improving Goods <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>No Crude or Shoddy Manufacturing Allowed</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that domestic goods have developed rapidly in recent years, but due to poor quality, goods for export are often unsold. This time, the foreign merchant Spaik Foreign Firm distributed domestic goods in our country and went to Southeast Asia to promote sales, but also failed to achieve good results due to the poor quality of domestic goods in our country. Local domestic goods manufacturers and authorities, in view of this situation, specially convened representatives of more than 30 domestic goods manufacturers at the International Trade Bureau a few days ago to discuss rescue measures. It was decided that the quality of domestic goods is of great importance to the future of domestic goods and that there must be a standard for the quality of each domestic product, and that no crude or shoddy manufacturing should be allowed, so as not to lose the belief of those who purchase domestic goods. However, how to proceed is still to be discussed further.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Both Exchanges Set to Merge Starting Next Month <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The City's Financial Market to Implement Unification</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, besides the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the city's financial market also has a Merchandise Exchange. Authorities from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, based on laws and regulations stating that exchanges of the same nature should not coexist in the same location, repeatedly ordered the two exchanges to merge. As such, the merger of the Securities Exchange and the securities section of the Merchandise Exchange was implemented last year. However, the merger of the gold markets was delayed because each exchange held its own ground, and the opinions of both sides were vastly different. Therefore, even after the deadline for the merger set by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry in May of last year, it was still difficult to implement the merger. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry originally intended to enforce it strictly, but due to the mediation efforts of Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, etc., an extension was granted. After this, the merger of the two exchanges was handled by the establishment of a preparatory office, with authorities from both exchanges and Du and Zhang engaging in mutual consultation. After multiple twists and turns, a complete resolution was reached on the 29th of last month. Both sides signed a contract, stating that the gold market of the Merchandise Exchange would be merged into the Shanghai Gold Exchange starting from October 1st. The original capital of the Gold Exchange was 1.5 million, and the Merchandise Exchange would add an additional 300,000, for a total of 1.8 million. In addition, among the original 100 brokers of the Merchandise Exchange, 25 would join the Gold Exchange after the merger. The gold market of the Merchandise Exchange will cease operations by the end of September, and trading for September will end on the 15th of this month, with no rollover allowed. After the merger, the name will remain the Shanghai Gold Exchange, and the location will also be at the original site of the Gold Exchange. None of the directors of the original Merchandise Exchange will join the merged Gold Exchange. After the signing of this contract, the long-delayed exchange merger turmoil was completely resolved. The preparatory office jointly established by the two exchanges at the Great China Hotel has already concluded its work. As for the original site of the Merchandise Exchange at the corner of Sichuan Road and Avenue Edward VII, according to Sheng Pihua, a director of the exchange, they have decided to rebuild it in the near future. The site covers 11 mu of land, and the future use of the site has not yet been determined. It is understood that the original name of the Merchandise Exchange was the Merchandise and Securities Exchange. The initial business included five items: margin trading, securities, cotton cloth, fur, and miscellaneous grains. Among them, the miscellaneous grains and fur items were discontinued shortly after, and the cotton cloth item was also suspended midway due to the Cotton Cloth Exchange. The securities section was merged last year. Now that the gold business has been merged in accordance with the Ministry's order, the exchange is no longer necessary in fact.</p>

Zhu Yangwu, the executive secretary of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, received them. Hu and Chen reported in detail to Executive Secretary Zhu the various abuses they suffered in Japan and stated that all their property was confiscated upon departure, so they were unable to maintain their daily needs and expenses after arriving in Shanghai and requested immediate relief. Consul General Zhu expressed acceptance of the matters reported by Chen and Hu and promised to forward their difficulties. Regarding the request for relief, they should still request it from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The representatives then left at 11:00 AM to report to the other overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>Re-Examination Necessary</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received reports from domestic goods factories in the city that the Guangdong Province was planning to implement a special import tax on goods from other provinces, which would hinder the sale of domestic goods. It repeatedly telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Guangdong Finance Department, requesting the cancellation of the order. The telegram has been recorded in previous reports. Now it is learned that the Shanghai and Guangdong Chambers of Commerce are discussing the issue of special taxes on domestic goods with each other. The original correspondence is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Letter from the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Received your Chamber of Commerce's letter No. 63, stating: "Received a letter from the Enamelware Industry Association on the 9th of this month, stating that according to a letter from members of the Huafeng Enamelware Company, etc., Guangzhou customers claimed that Guangzhou is currently experiencing industrial depression, and major factories and businesses have successively closed. In addition to the original documents on file requesting exemption from redundant narratives, it is proposed that your Chamber of Commerce suggest to the bureau of your province to send personnel to Shanghai before the implementation to investigate and identify which are Chinese factories and which are not, so as to avoid domestic goods manufacturers from being affected equally." Approved this, this case was submitted by the government for discussion, and the case was deliberated and reported back to the government. The suggestion mentioned in the letter from the industry and commerce sectors is a misunderstanding. If your Chamber of Commerce considers it not entirely appropriate, you should make another suggestion to the government so that it is direct. Our Chamber of Commerce will also conduct separate re-examinations to ensure that purely domestic goods manufacturers both inside and outside the province are not harmed and to assist in the process." The letter is enclosed for your reference.</p>

<p>To the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, received your letter No. 874 on the 4th of this month with respect. Shanghai and Guangdong commerce are closely related and cannot be forcibly divided. Your Chamber of Commerce is a fellow traveler and has a duty to help each other. Since it is said that the provincial government's discussion on the special tax case is considered by your Chamber of Commerce to be worthy of re-examination, it is clear that public opinion is in the hearts of the people. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is grateful to hear this. We urge you to forward the letter previously sent to your Chamber of Commerce to the provincial government and to express your high opinions and thoroughly explain the advantages and disadvantages, so that the authorities will realize that benefiting others is benefiting themselves. Your Chamber of Commerce is close to the water and advocates fairness for the affairs of other provinces with the people of this province, and your position is more likely to be heard than that of our Chamber of Commerce. The success of this case depends on your Chamber of Commerce. As for the suggestion to make a direct suggestion, our Chamber of Commerce has already telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the provincial government since the occurrence of this case. Recently, we received a reply from the provincial government stating that the original telegram has been submitted to the Finance Department for joint review. Yesterday, we also telegraphed the Finance Department to clearly state the advantages and disadvantages. We have heard that your intentions are in line with our intentions and are reporting this together. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Municipal Finance Bureau Takes Over Tax Collection <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Long-Term Certificates Changed Every Five Years, Tax Amount Reduced</p>
<p>Fees for Collection Procedures Have Been Abolished</p>
<p>The city's brokerage tax has long been designated for education funding and has been handled by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office. The long-term and short-term brokerage taxes in the city area of the old Baoshan County were collected on behalf of the county government by the Management Office. The long-term brokerage taxes in the city area of the old Shanghai County were also collected on behalf of the county government. All short-term brokerage taxes in Shanghai County were handled by merchants on a quota basis. In order to unify administration, the Shanghai Municipal Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval this spring to take over the city's brokerage tax collection. The Municipal Government then sent personnel to negotiate with the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office to take over the procedures and, following the method of taking over the slaughter tax collection last year, agreed that the Shanghai Municipal Government would allocate 42,000 yuan annually to maintain special education funds. Thus, the city's brokerage tax, which had been collected by the province for many years, was transferred to the city for self-management on the first of this month. Yesterday, the Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice to start the collection. Before taking over, the Finance Bureau, after referring to the opinions of the National Finance Conference on the examination of brokerage tax and adopting the regulations of the Jiangsu Province Brokerage Association, drafted the Shanghai Municipal Brokerage Operation Rules and the Finance Bureau's Detailed Rules for the Collection of Brokerage Tax and submitted them to the Municipal Government for submission to the Ministry of Finance and then to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. It has also been announced and implemented by the Municipal Government. It is heard that after the Finance Bureau takes over the collection of the city's brokerage tax, the methods have been slightly changed compared to before. The main points are briefly recorded as follows: (1) The registration certificate for long-term brokerage tax was originally stipulated to be 20 years, but now, in order to facilitate the issuance of certificates to merchants, it has been changed to every five years, and the amount of registration tax has been reduced as much as possible (for example, the registration tax for a first-class long-term certificate in prosperous areas should have been 750 yuan, but it has now been changed to 160 yuan). (2) When paying the registration tax, the brokerage firm originally had to pay an additional 10% of the tax amount as a handling fee for the operating expenses of the collection agency. Now that it has been transferred to the city for self-management, the collection is directly collected by the collection offices under the Finance Bureau, and this handling fee is no longer necessary and has been abolished. (3) The items collected with the annual brokerage business tax in the city area in the past included education fees, construction special donations, self-government funds, and collection fees. These have now been abolished. However, the stamp tax that should be affixed to the certificate is still required to be handled in accordance with regulations because it is a central government tax. (4) Article 3 of the Ministry's Measures for the Reorganization of Brokerage Tax, promulgated in June of this year, restricts the commission charged by brokerage firms to 3%. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Brokerage Operation Rules promulgated this time also stipulate that the brokerage commission is limited to 3%, which is borne equally by both the buyer and the seller. (5) City area brokerage firms can contact the nearby collection offices to handle the payment of registration tax and business tax. Registration certificates that have not expired must be submitted to the collection office for verification and stamping before the end of this month to remain valid. Certificates that have expired must apply for new certificates in accordance with the regulations. (Regulations omitted)</p>

<p>The summer recess of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board has ended, and it reconvened on the afternoon of September 5th. Due to the fact that the Chairman, Mr. Arnold, encountered banditry while traveling through the Northeast on his return to Shanghai from Europe, and also encountered a hurricane in Qingdao, he was unable to return to Shanghai as scheduled, so the Vice Chairman, Mr. MacNaghten, presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>The Chairman announced that Mr. Funatsu, a director, had sent a letter requesting his resignation. Mr. Funatsu has served as a director for six or seven years. His enthusiasm and humble attitude have been unanimously respected. It is a great pity that he is no longer able to serve as a director due to his busy business. After speaking, Mr. Funatsu immediately expressed his gratitude to the directors for their kindness and was especially grateful for the chairman's words. He then nominated Mr. Yamamoto, the Shanghai branch manager of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, as a qualified candidate for the position of director. The directors unanimously decided to publicly elect Mr. Yamamoto to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Funatsu and serve as a director until the end of the current municipal year.</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Management Committee submitted a report to the Board of Directors, stating the work of the committee in August.

<h3 id="e135">Chinese and Foreign Charity Association Investigator Reports on Drought Situation in Jiangpu <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Charity Association at 97 Renji Road, considering that the drought in various places is extremely serious this time, has sent special investigators to investigate. The report on the drought situation in Jiangpu County is recorded as follows: The terrain of the county stretches from west to east across a large mountain range. The front of the mountain faces the river, and the back of the mountain borders the river. All the fields are divided into two parts: mountain fields and polder fields. The polder fields are further divided into upper and lower polders. The upper polders are no different from the mountain fields, and the lower polders are also difficult to get tidal water due to river siltation. The entire western district is all mountain fields, and the disaster is most severe in this area. The northern district is behind the mountain and is slightly less affected. The southeast district is in front of the mountain and has very few fields, and is even less affected. Since last winter, there has been little rain and snow in the county, and this year it has suffered a severe drought for three months. Statistics show that more than 80% of the county has been affected by the disaster. The crops in the high fields are not to be mentioned, and the drought-resistant grains have also sprouted sparsely after several sowings due to lack of rain. Although there has been autumn rain recently, it is too late to do any good. Food is now causing panic, and disaster victims are begging in groups everywhere. After inspecting for 20 to 30 li, there are no strong men in the fields, and there is no smoke from the chimneys in the villages. Only many disaster-stricken children are seen begging along the way or crying in hunger. It is heartbreaking and tragic beyond description. The county has a charity home, which can house some disaster-stricken children, but the number of people is too large and cannot be accommodated, and the expenses are also difficult, almost unsustainable.</p>

<p>Relief for Refugees in Zhenyejiaji</p>
<p>Handling Rice Sales at Par in Eastern Fujian</p>
<p>Investigating the Disaster Situation in Liyang</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Main Branch of the World Red Swastika Society received reports from Zhou Genjing, the commissioner of disaster relief in Anhui Province, and the Fuzhou Office regarding the disaster relief situation in great detail. They are recorded as follows: Anhui Luan suffers from severe drought this year, and the disaster is severe. The people are already sighing in despair. Recently, red bandits have continued to appear from time to time in the mountains between Ying and Huo, near the mountain market towns. The people cannot live in peace and have fled with their families, gathering in Zhenyejiaji, Luan. They are emaciated and have no clothes or food. The various tragic scenes are difficult to describe in words. The commissioner was in Luan, witnessed the situation firsthand, and saw the tragedy and could not help but file a petition on their behalf. After hearing the report from Commissioner Zhou, it was immediately discussed and telegraphed back to Commissioner Zhou, approving the allocation of 2,500 yuan from the relief funds to relieve the refugees in the Zhenyejiaji shelter.</p>
<p>The Fuzhou Office telegraphed that the 2,000 shi of rice allocated by the society was shipped to Fuzhou, but it was appropriately timed to when Fujian Province was not peaceful, and upstream traffic was blocked, so it could not be transported separately. Now that traffic has gradually resumed, transportation is still difficult. It is now found that the disaster area in the five counties under the jurisdiction of Funing in Eastern Fujian is in dire need of rice after the robbery. 500 shi of rice has been allocated and handed over to Chairman Lin Baoqi, together with Jun Hu, to escort and transport it for rice sales at par. It is heard that the office has telegraphed back to follow the instructions.</p>
<p>The office has paid close attention to the drought in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces and has determined that Liyang County in Jiangsu Province is the most severely affected area. Chairman Li Cikai of the office personally went to investigate and found that a family of eight had committed suicide by closing their doors. The tragedy that occurred in the northwest several years ago has now been staged in the southeast. It is hoped that people in the southeastern provinces will not ignore the disaster just because it has not yet reached them.</p>

<p>Health Bureau Has Established Preventive Vaccination Centers</p>
<p>Injections by Various Offices, Hospitals, Etc.</p>
<p>As summer ends and autumn arrives, seasonal epidemics will again become prevalent. In order to prevent them, the Municipal Health Bureau has decided to divide the city into 50 prevention centers starting from the 15th of this month to administer vaccinations to citizens. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Summer Cholera Has Passed Peacefully <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to You Jihua, the director of the South City Office of the Health Bureau, cholera and smallpox, which were prevalent in the summer, have been eliminated since autumn arrived. This year, due to the effective prevention by both the Chinese and foreign concessions, only two people contracted cholera, which can be said to have passed peacefully. The places with the highest incidence of cholera and smallpox internationally are Calcutta, Marmagoa, and Mathes. There is a possibility of occurrence in these places regardless of whether it is winter or summer. From the 18th to the 31st of last month, 143 people contracted cholera and seven people contracted smallpox.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Diphtheria and Meningitis Will Occur <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Now it is autumn again, and the most prevalent seasonal epidemic diseases are diphtheria and meningitis. These two diseases can become prevalent on cloudy days with low air pressure and on dry days with high air pressure. Children under the age of five should take preventive measures the most. Diphtheria should be prevented by injecting toxin antitoxin needles in advance. In order to avoid accidents for two or three years, it is hoped that middle and upper-class citizens will not hesitate to spend a yuan or two on the needle fees. As for the meningitis vaccine injection, the bureau can provide it free of charge.</p>
<h3 id="e140">More Than Fifty Free Injection Sites <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Health Bureau believes that the absence of diseases among citizens is the happiness of the entire city. Therefore, it is making every effort to prevent seasonal epidemics. The epidemic prevention office for preventing cholera and other diseases this year will be closed. The bureau will start preventive vaccinations on the 15th of this month, dividing the sites into fifty locations. Various health offices, hospitals, and registered qualified doctors will provide free vaccinations and administer vaccinations.</p>

<p>The Chinese American Tobacco Company's creation of the Chinese Historical Standard Hero Election Scholarship is an expansion of last year's "Buy Sī Qiān" scholarship program, and has therefore garnered much sympathy from all sides. The company's general manager, Jing Yi Meng, in order to realize his long-held ambition of promoting domestic goods and advocating education, has made enormous sacrifices for this contribution. For example, one million color hero election ballots were elaborately printed, with portraits and deeds of two hundred male and female heroes printed on the ballots and widely distributed throughout the country. The display windows of the company's Nanjing Road branch invited painters to exquisitely paint color portraits of two hundred people, classified and displayed according to sovereign, sage, literature, art, chivalry, modern heroes, and female models. The displays were dazzling and beautiful, attracting crowds. Furthermore, national scholar Yu Tingwu was invited to broadcast brief biographies of the two hundred people on Lì Lì every night from 8:00 to 9:00 PM. Therefore, more than 5,000 people request election ballots from various tobacco shops and the branch every day. The enthusiasm of all sectors' participation can be imagined.</p>

Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, they inquired about Qi from all sides, only to find that he had already left Shanghai for elsewhere. As a result, Li, Zhou, and their two children are stranded in Shanghai, unfamiliar with the area. They not only lack food and clothing, but also, as women, have no place to stay. They wish to return to their hometown but lack travel expenses. They specifically sent a letter yesterday to the Xinwei Relief Society on Yunnan Road in this city, requesting them to issue ship tickets to Tianjin in order to return home. At the same time, Wang Ziyao, a representative of Li and Du, sent a letter of certification, requesting special consideration and the immediate issuance of two ship tickets and 20 yuan each for travel expenses, so that they could return to their hometown as soon as possible. The Xinwei Relief Society, after reviewing the letter, will provide appropriate relief to prevent them from becoming destitute.</p>

<p>A Robber Fires a Shot and a Stray Bullet Wounds a Passerby</p>
<p>Qin Yushan from Hubei Province works as a recruiter for major hotels and ocean liners, and lives at No. 356 Fuyou Road in the city. His monthly income is reasonably adequate. Qin's wife, Zhan, although aging, has a fondness for adornment. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, as usual, she carried a basket to the market to buy vegetables. Unexpectedly, upon returning home, just as she arrived at the entrance of Mingzhu Lane on Fuyou Road, two robbers wearing dark-colored shirts and pants suddenly jumped out from the roadside. One robber pointed a gun at her side, forbidding her from making any noise, and immediately snatched a gold bracelet from her. They carried it and fled south. However, Zhan, seeing her gold object being robbed, shouted loudly to catch the robbers. One robber, in desperation, turned around and fired a shot. A stray bullet hit Zhang Jinxiang, a Hangzhou native who collects paper scraps and cinders, in the right leg. Zhang fell to the ground in pain. Wei Kun, a policeman from the No. 6 post of the First Sub-District of the Second District, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene and bravely gave chase. However, at that time, there were many passersby near the City God Temple, and the policeman was unable to fire his gun. Therefore, the two robbers took advantage of this opportunity and quickly disappeared into the crowd. Afterwards, Chief Shen Zhenhua led the police to the scene and sent the injured person to Shanghai Hospital by car. He also reported to the Inspectorate by phone.</p>

<p>Police Officers Find the Abductor Flees</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, Lu Zixiang, from the 39th post of the Sixth District at the intersection of Baihe South Road and Yidingpan Road in Western Shanghai, was on duty when he suddenly saw a girl with a beautiful face, short hair, wearing a cheongsam, and carrying a schoolbag, about ten years old, standing still and crying beside the post. He immediately went forward to inquire, but the girl cried even more sadly and did not answer a word, as if she were lost there. He immediately took the girl back to the Sixth District. After interrogation by District Officer Xing, the girl stated her name was Qin Baodi, twelve years old, and she lived at No. 83, Anlan Lane, Xuejia浜 in the South City. This morning, she left home to go to school. Because it was still early, she held two small yuan and wanted to buy a pen at a certain tobacco and paper shop. Just as she was knocking on the door of the shop, an unfamiliar man suddenly came from behind and told me to go with him to buy it. I believed him to be true and followed him for many roads, to near Jing'an Temple. I realized that I was being abducted and firmly refused to go. He forcibly dragged me to near the police post. Because my legs were weak and I could no longer walk, I stood and cried, intending to report it in the meantime, but I dared not speak. The man mistook my intent to report and immediately ran away. Seeing that I had escaped from the tiger's mouth, I was panicking when I was spotted by the police officer. District Officer Xing, after hearing her statement, determined that the girl had been abducted but had fortunately escaped by a clever plan. He immediately sent her to the bureau for disposal.</p>

<p>Two factions of butchers from the French Concession Slaughterhouse Company in Pudong and Jiangyin engaged in a fight last month. Xu Zhongqiu, Yao Shengxiang, Xu Mingde, Wu Fuda, and Ren Jintang, five people from the Jiangyin faction, were injured by knives and axes. The patrolmen arrived and arrested Qin Haichang, Gao Shanyun, Wang Renren from the Pudong faction. Subsequently, Chen Jinhai and four others from Pudong, suspected of instigating the fight, were arrested and transferred to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After the interrogation, the case was postponed for further investigation. It was reported in the previous news. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. First, the victim Ren Jinbao testified that at 12:00 midnight that night, he and four companions went to work at the company and were stopped by Chen Jinhai, who held a pistol to them and forbade them from working, forcing them into a dark alley. He saw more than twenty people who, without asking any questions, attacked them with iron rods and axes. He was slashed in the back by "Ā Sì Má Zi" (possibly a nickname) and fell to the ground screaming for help. He only recognized Chen Jinhai and their associates, as well as the people they had called in from other gangs. Based on this, the court interrogated Chen Jinhai, who categorically denied being at the scene, claiming that he was innocent and framed because his associates had reported them. Asked, "What does the associates' fight have to do with your boss?" He replied, "They suspect that I called the associates to report them." The court then summoned the defendant Chen Jinhai's witness, Gu Qiusheng (who had appeared in court last time), who testified that Chen Jinhai came to my place that night, as agreed the night before, to talk, and then he went back alone. At this point, Chen interjected, "Wasn't there a dog walker who came to call me at that time?" Gu also said that a dog walker had come, but he did not know his name. After questioning, the judge ordered the start of the debate, which was conducted by the patrol's lawyer Fei Xizhen and the two lawyers hired by the defendant, Wang Shizong and Jiang Yiping. After the lawyers debated the attached private prosecution, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for ten days later. The defendants were returned to custody. Chen Jinhai also filed a petition for bail, which the court ordered to be granted upon payment of a 3,000 yuan bond and a 3,000 yuan shop guarantee.</p>

His family members, upon hearing the news, were very anxious and went to the Patriotic Martyr Assistance Association, organized by various sectors, requesting assistance in transferring him to a hospital for treatment to avoid accidents. After receiving the report, the association sent committee member Chen Jiufeng to confer with the handling lawyers Wei Junshuo, Zhang Shizhao, Yu Hualong, etc., to discuss solutions. It was decided that Attorney Ma would draft a complaint requesting the prison warden to allow transfer to a hospital for medical treatment, and that they would visit him at the Tilanqiao Western Prison today together with his family members.</p>

<p>A Patient's Family Transforms into Extortionists</p>
<p>Forcing Gu at Gunpoint to Write a Note to Take Money Home</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Puller's Heroic Action of Jumping out of the Window to Save His Master is Laudable</p>
<p>Gu Also Jumps from the Window, Suffering Multiple Injuries</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Yuqi, the current president of Tongde Medical College at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Dagu Road, is originally from Wuxi. Because of his deep knowledge of medicine, he is highly trusted by patients. Earlier this month, a patient named Zhang requested a house call. This person lives in a three-story attic in a Westerner's house at No. 228 Huanlong Road. This was the third time this patient had requested Gu to provide treatment. Yesterday, after being invited by the patient, Gu went to Huanlong Road in his own car around 1:00 PM. Gu had a rickshaw puller as his attendant, to carry his leather bag and do other work. As usual, he accompanied Gu into the room. As Gu was taking the patient's pulse, several members of the Zhang family stood by. Unexpectedly, one of these people suddenly took out a pistol and struck the rickshaw puller on the head with the gun butt. The rickshaw puller immediately broke his skin and bled, falling unconscious for a moment. At the same time, another person among the group took out a gun and pointed it at Gu, demanding that he hand over his money immediately. Gu said that he had no money on him, and that his checks and other valuables were not with him, and that he needed to go home to get them, and told them that everything could be discussed. The other party immediately ordered Gu to write a note. The tone of the note roughly said, "The rickshaw puller's life is in danger, quickly go home and get money to redeem him." The note was written as if it were written by Gu's rickshaw puller. While Gu was writing the note, the rickshaw puller who had fainted woke up and saw his master in trouble. He disregarded his own safety and jumped out of the window on the third floor. Unexpectedly, because he was too high off the ground, he was injured on the spot in the lane there. Nearby neighbors gathered when they saw this situation. The people in the room, seeing that their plan had been exposed, scattered and left. Before leaving, they ordered Gu to wait ten minutes before coming out. At this time, Gu, fearing further danger, dared not go out through the front door, and also jumped out of the window. Because there happened to be a bed placed on the ground there, intending to jump on the bed, he failed to land properly and also fell to the ground. Neighbors who saw this gathered even more. At this time, Gu's rickshaw puller waited for a long time and did not see Gu come out, and there was noise from the back door. He left the rickshaw to investigate and saw this situation. He ran madly to Gu's friend's place, borrowed a telephone, and reported to the police and called for an ambulance. The Xuehuali Road patrol station dispatched a detective and an ambulance to send the two injured people to Guangci Hospital. The rickshaw puller's injuries were minor, but Dr. Gu suffered multiple injuries.</p>

<p>The Largest Batch Since January 28th</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, large quantities of Japanese kelp vegetables have not been shipped to Shanghai. Although some were shipped later, they were only three or four hundred pieces. Recently, Japanese marine products have been sold at low prices in various ports in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Therefore, yesterday, 10,000 pieces of kelp were shipped from Otaru and Yokohama in Japan, which is one of the largest batches of Japanese kelp imported since the January 28th Incident. It has been unloaded into the Huishan Wharf warehouse and will be completely transferred to various ports along the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Panic over the Impending Closure of Private Postal Services at the End of the Year <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Sending a Letter to the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association for Assistance</p>
<p>Submitting a Petition to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for a Five-Year Extension</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai received a letter yesterday from Hua Yunjin and others, representatives of the private postal services, requesting assistance. The original letter stated: "Greetings. According to the private postal service representatives Hua Yunjin, Wang Wenjiang, Wang Tongren, Wu Yunyu, Ren Shiting, and Yin Wutong, etc., our industry has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to cease operations by the end of this year. We are extremely anxious that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Inland Chambers of Commerce have repeatedly appealed on our behalf, but have not received approval from the competent authorities. Most of the people in our industry are fellow townsmen from Ningbo and Shaoxing. Now that the deadline is approaching, the lives of tens of thousands of fellow townsmen are at stake, and we must explain it clearly to your association. Private postal services have a history of over a hundred years, and they exist in both large cities and remote rural villages, involving countless connections. Can closing them down be completed in a few months? This is the first point. Most of the employees in various places are old and frail laborers, totaling no less than 30,000 to 40,000 people. Their livelihoods are at stake, which is an urgent and critical issue. Once unemployed, they will inevitably become starving corpses. This is the second point. Recently, industry and commerce have been declining throughout the country, and this year's drought is especially unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. The people in our industry cover agriculture, industry, and commerce, and are all in despair at this dead end. Is it possible for the country to disregard the lives of the people for the sake of postal unification, and is the Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood suitable? This is the third point. Various chambers of commerce and public institutions in various places have a strong need for private postal services, so they have consistently maintained them. This is a clear fact. Ordinary small industrial and commercial people have a particularly close relationship with them due to the convenience of delivery. The fellow townsmen from Ningbo and Shaoxing are even more of an exception, receiving assistance due to their proximity. This is the fourth point. In short, national policies and the lives of the people must be considered together in order to maintain fairness and reason. Therefore, the only solution now is to set a five-year deadline, with our industry issuing a written guarantee to gradually close down, which can alleviate its difficulties. The country has been operating the post office for forty years, and the effect of unification can be achieved in the near future. At this critical juncture, we have no choice but to risk offending and respectfully request your association to consider the feelings of our hometown and the urgency of our situation, to present the situation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Committee, to create blessings for our fellow townsmen, and to graciously order the Ministry of Communications to extend the deadline for five years to allow for closure. Then, our hometown will be grateful and our families will be blessed. We humbly submit our words of gratitude and await your instructions. Respectfully presented to the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai." (Below omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Hotel Industry Opposes Increasing Police Rates, Supplementing Three Reasons <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a petition was again submitted to the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency stated that the hotel industry has repeatedly opposed the Municipal Council's increase in police rates. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the industry again sent representatives Sun Qiuping, Chen Wenda, Gu Jiemei, Zhang Renliang, Zhang Qiyuan, Li Jiemei, Liu Qirun, Zhan Wenxi, Yao Hongchu, Zou Jincheng, etc., to petition the Municipal Council's Director He Dequi, supplementing the points not detailed in the past as follows: (1) The Ratepayers Department has repeatedly stated that if any of the businesses that have been added to the rates consider the increase unreasonable, they can apply to the Assessment Committee for reassessment. However, the Assessment Committee is not a third party, but merely an agency attached to the Municipal Council. To request the Municipal Council to reassess the rates that the Municipal Council has increased in order to seek exemption from the rates is like seeking the skin from a tiger. This is why the representatives are unwilling to apply to the Assessment Committee for reassessment. (2) The Taxpayers' Meeting resolved that, without the authorization of the taxpayers, no arbitrary increases in rates shall be made, except for newly built houses and rented city houses. Now, the Ratepayers Department has had a fanciful idea, using the prices of hotel rooms as a tool for assessing and increasing rates. However, the businesses that have been added to the rates had already been assessed by the Municipal Council in the past. Now, there is a sudden change in practice, is this not a contradiction in itself? And where does this place the resolution of the Taxpayers' Meeting? (3) Since the January 28th Shanghai War, there have been countless Japanese and Westerners who have defaulted on rates and taxes. The Ratepayers Department does not focus on this when rectifying tax collection, but disregards everything and imposes exorbitant taxes on our hotel industry, fully demonstrating the Ratepayers Department's weakness of bullying the kind and fearing the fierce. Our hotel industry is in a precarious situation, and we are forced to embrace a great determination and vow to persevere to the end. If the Ratepayers Department consistently refuses to accommodate us and withdraws its decision, we will not hesitate to make any sacrifices or be softened by any threats (i.e., revocation of licenses). Director He promised to submit the matter to the Board Meeting for discussion, and the representatives were satisfied and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e159">The French Concession Strictly Cracks Down on Rabid Dogs <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Dog Owners and All Sectors Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Health Department of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council, after finding that cases of rabid dogs biting people have occurred recently within the concession, has already presented the matter to the Superintendent-General Fu Lesi and decided to strictly crack down on them. In addition to notifying all dog owners, it will also distribute notices on preventing rabies. The notices are copied below: (1) Notice Regarding the Crackdown: It has come to our attention that there have been multiple cases of rabies in the French Concession recently. Strict measures have been adopted to suppress the spread of infection. Dog owners must strictly comply with Article 1 of the Bureau's regulations on dogs on the road. Any dog found walking on the road without a muzzle will be arrested by the patrolmen, imprisoned in the dog pound. In addition, dog owners must have their dogs vaccinated against rabies. This is the notice. (2) Notice Regarding Precautions: It has come to our attention that there have been multiple cases of rabies in the French Concession recently, and several people have been bitten by rabid dogs. Residents within the concession should pay attention to the following points: (1) What is rabies? Rabies is a severe disease. Although this disease is not contagious, humans can contract it by being bitten by a rabid animal. (2) Method of transmission: Whether this rabies is transmitted from animal to animal or from animal to human, the method of transmission is through bites, scratches by cats, or being licked on a wound by a rabid animal. The more wounds there are, the greater the risk of contracting rabies. The farther the wound is from the central nervous system, the less severe the rabies. Bites to the face are the most dangerous, followed by bites to the hands, upper body, and lower body, with the severity of rabies decreasing as the bite location descends. (3) Several symptoms of rabies in dogs: When a dog first contracts rabies, its temperament suddenly changes, gradually becoming melancholic, depressed, suspicious, and silent. It will avoid solitary and dark places, and its guarding ability will gradually decrease. If someone calls it, it must be forced to obey. It will crawl, with its ears drooping, and stare at its owner with a gloomy gaze. At this time, the dog has no intention of biting. Its appearance still appears healthy, and sometimes its appetite even increases. However, these symptoms increase rapidly, and the dog's suspicion becomes increasingly severe, often hiding in dark places, suddenly standing up, then suddenly lying down, repeating several times and constantly fidgeting. The disease then becomes more severe, leading to paralysis or madness. Therefore, if there is any change in a dog's habits or appearance, it should be suspected of having rabies and sent to a veterinarian for examination. (4) Methods of preventing rabies in dogs: A veterinarian can vaccinate a dog against rabies, providing immunity for approximately one year. (5) Consult a doctor immediately and do not delay.</p>

<p>Two Handguns Seized From Four Suspects</p>
<p>Confessed to Trafficking; Handed Over to Bureau for Legal Action</p>
<p>City Police Bureau Detective Team Deputy Leader Dong Wenrui received a tip that bandits were transporting firearms from the French Concession to the Xieqiao area in the Chinese district, intending to commit robbery. Dong immediately reported this to Detective Team Leader Lu Ying, who promptly dispatched several armed detectives, along with police detectives from the Second District, to Xieqiao around 8 PM the previous night. They lay in ambush on all sides. At 10:30 PM, two bandits approached in the darkness. The officers shouted "Catch them!" and surrounded them, apprehending Xie Hongsheng from Yancheng and Lü Delin from Ningbo. A five-inch Browning handgun with ten bullets was found on Xie. They were taken into custody. Lü confessed that another handgun was hidden at the home of accomplice Xu Zijie from Shaoxing, located at 213 Lujiazhai, Hutai Road, near the Sun Temple in Zhabei, at 204 Tianbao Lane, Haining Road, Zhabei. Acting on this information, the officers escorted the suspects, along with the Zhabei police, to the address, apprehended Xu, and confirmed the existence of another handgun, which had been sold to accomplice Yang Wenqing from Baoshan, residing at 27 Changxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. Officer Lu dispatched the same officers yesterday morning to the aforementioned location, where they apprehended Yang and confiscated a handgun with seven bullets. They were taken into custody. Yang confessed that he was currently working as a cook for Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and was also a member of the Pengpu Defense Corps. He stated that the handgun was purchased on behalf of a relative, Shui Ayang, and that he entrusted Xu Amao, a member of the Second Regiment of the Defense Corps in Lujiazhai, to buy it for thirty yuan, sixteen of which had been paid on the first of this month. Fearing accidents, he had Xie Hongsheng transport it. Officer Lu, considering the case involved the transport and private possession of firearms, ordered the four suspects, along with the two handguns and seventeen bullets, to be handed over to the Third Section of the General Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Turned Himself in to Police After Being Wanted</p>
<p>Claimed to Have Been Cheated of 30,000 by a Customer</p>
<p>Wei Zuzhen from Shaoxing was a broker at Yuan Yu Securities Firm at 4 Ningbo Road, 4 Yongqing Lane. On the 29th of last month, Jun Chang Securities Firm at 260 Avenue Edward VII purchased 50,000 yuan in 20-year customs treasury bonds from Yuan Yu. At 4 PM, Yuan Yu handed the treasury bonds to Wei to deliver to Jun Chang. However, Wei disappeared without delivering the bonds. Jun Chang reported this to the Shanghai Municipal Police, and the First Special District Court issued an arrest warrant. Yuan Yu offered a reward of 3,000 yuan and placed advertisements in newspapers for Wei's arrest. Unexpectedly, at 5:30 PM yesterday, Wei turned himself in to the police. Under questioning by Chinese Detective Zhang Mingde and Detectives Gao Yanrong and Huang Fusen, Wei claimed that after leaving the store with the bonds that day, he met a fellow broker named Wang Dequan at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Henan Road. Wang asked Wei to temporarily lend him 30,000 yuan of the treasury bonds, saying that a customer wanted to purchase that amount immediately, and that the funds would be returned in half an hour at the Shanghai Tea House near Daigou Bridge, along with a commission of 300 yuan. Wei, enticed by the small profit, handed over the bonds. However, Wang disappeared without a trace, and Wei has been unable to find him despite searching for days. He therefore turned himself in to the police and surrendered the remaining 20,000 yuan in bonds. Yesterday morning, he was brought before the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated the facts and charged Wei under Article 357 of the Criminal Code, adding that the reliability of the defendant's statement needed to be investigated and requesting a one-week adjournment. Judge Feng Shide questioned Wei briefly and ordered a one-week adjournment for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Robbers Posed as Passengers and Robbed the Bus South of Caohejing</p>
<p>Two Police Officers Fought Bravely Against Four Robbers, Killing One; the Rest Escaped</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Pinghu intercity bus operated by the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Company on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district, Bus No. 6, which departed from Shanghai at 10 AM the previous morning, was robbed of cash, foreign currency, and jewelry worth over a thousand yuan from passengers Liu Cui and others near the railway south of Caohejing Station. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Further details are as follows: At 10 AM the previous morning, Shanghai-Pinghu Bus No. 4196, carrying over twenty male and female passengers, was driven by driver Zhang Lansheng to the Tushanwan Station. Two robbers, one wearing a white short shirt and pants, and the other wearing a dark raw silk long gown and a straw hat with a pockmarked face,</p>
<h3 id="e165">Posing as Passengers <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>purchased tickets to Qianliangmiao Station. At 10:20 AM, about two miles south of Caohejing Station (i.e., north of the Huiling Station railway), the two robbers who boarded at Tushanwan revealed their sinister faces. Each drew a handgun, first forcing driver Zhang Lansheng to stop the bus, and then robbing passengers Liu Cui and three others. The items stolen included: (1) From female passenger Liu Cui, who lived next to the church in Haiyan, a jade bracelet, a jade ring, a diamond platinum watch, a gold ring, a small leather wallet, a Bing Chu gold pocket watch with a gold chain, two jade pendants, and a gold cigarette holder and gold toothpick, plus over ten yuan in cash; (2) From Wang Jiahou, who lived on Tinglin West Street, a gold watch; (3) From Tao Taiqing, who lived on Minhang North Street, a gold ring and nineteen yuan in cash; (4) From Huang Xingji, who lived on Shi Street in Pinghu, a check for three hundred yuan and over ten yuan in cash.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Total Losses <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>were estimated to be over a thousand yuan. At that moment, driver Pan Liansheng, driving a bus from Minhang to Shanghai for the same company, passed by. Zhang Lansheng signaled the robbery. Upon learning of the situation, Pan Liansheng sped to Caohejing Station and telephoned the Sixth District Third Precinct of the Municipal Police Bureau. Precinct Chief Wu Zhengding, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched patrol officers Yuan Desheng, Li Huapu, Fu Guohui, Ma Jilong, and others, leading a team of officers, and rushed to the scene to encircle and apprehend the robbers. He also notified the Meilong outposts of the Longhua harbor by telephone. At the same time, the two robbers on the bus, seeing the bus from Minhang to Shanghai pass by, dared not rob any further. They demanded the keys from driver Zhang Lansheng, opened the door, and fled to the northwest.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Fled in Panic <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>By the time the officers arrived, the robbers were already far away. They split up to track and pursue them. At Huacun Temple, passing the Sanguantang and turning north to Baziqiao (an area under the jurisdiction of the Hongqiao Township outpost of the First Precinct of the Sixth District), they spotted two men who resembled the robbers walking ahead. At that time, only police officers Deng Zhenxiang and Li Shuangying were present; the others had scattered. The two robbers noticed them and immediately opened fire to resist arrest. Deng and Li also drew their guns and returned fire. Seeing that the situation was not favorable, the robbers crossed several rivers. Pursuing them to the Puhuitang River, the robbers swam to escape. Deng and Li bravely crossed the river to continue the pursuit. At Wangjia Lane, east of Hongqiao Township, two robbers suddenly jumped out from a thicket of branches and willows beside a house, each drawing a handgun and joining the fierce battle. Gunshots rang out, and bullets flew like rain.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Both Sides Clashed <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The battle lasted fifteen minutes, with a total of sixty or seventy shots fired. One of the two robbers was shot by Officer Deng in the left chest and fell in front of the ancestral hall east of Wangjia Lane. He was apprehended, and a six-inch Browning handgun, No. 129012, was seized. Another robber was shot in the left foot and was carried away by the two robbers who had been lying in ambush. Officers Deng and Li, being over ten miles from their station and running out of ammunition and reinforcements, did not dare to pursue them further. They hired a rickshaw to transport the captured robber back to the station. He was still able to speak and identified himself as Zhang Shiying from Xujiahui, but said nothing else before</p>

<p>The robber was about thirty years old, with a flat-top haircut, wearing a white silk short shirt over a white undershirt, white cotton pants, dark brown silk socks, and black satin-topped leather shoes. He wore a jade bracelet and a jade ring, which the victim Liu Cui identified as the stolen items (yesterday's report incorrectly stated that two gold watches were recovered). Later, Prosecutor Tang from the District Court, accompanied by an examiner, arrived to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the robber had died from gunshot wounds sustained while resisting arrest. He ordered the local guard to prepare a coffin and temporarily house the body at the altar. It is reported that the bus company, to protect the safety of passengers, has requested that the authorities increase the number of officers patrolling along the route and has also dispatched personnel to protect the buses.</p>

<p>Wang Bao, a woman from Ningbo, aged 41, resided at 133 Datong Road, Zhabei, in a three-story attic room. Her husband, Wang Zhaowei, died of illness on December 27th of last year. Since then, she had been living alone and supporting herself by running a fruit stall in the vicinity. In March of this year, Wang Bao gave birth to a posthumous daughter. Due to a lack of breast milk, she sent the infant back to her ancestral home to be raised. The day before yesterday, at noon, Wang Bao's nephew, Wang Ziyu (who lived on the second floor), called her for lunch but received no response. He went up to the attic and found her lying on the floor, covered in urine and feces, with a hemp rope around her neck. Alarmed, he cried for help. Neighbors gathered and discovered that she had hanged herself with a thin hemp rope. Due to her obesity, the rope had broken. Despite attempts to rescue her, it was too late. Yesterday morning, the local Fifth District Third Precinct instructed the local guard Li A'er to report the incident to the District Court for an autopsy. Subsequently, Wang Ziyu, 24 years old, from Ningbo, and currently working as a craftsman at the American Electric Material Company, claimed to the court that the deceased, Wang Bao, was his aunt. Since his uncle's death, she had suffered a significant mental shock, often expressing a desire to end her life and attempting suicide, but had been persuaded to return home. This time, unfortunately, she succeeded. He also stated that her mother's family was still in her ancestral home and had already been notified. They would arrive in a few days. Fearing future complications, he reported the incident to request an autopsy and offered to arrange for the coffin and funeral. Subsequently, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, accompanied by an examiner, arrived at the scene and confirmed the facts, instructing that a coffin be prepared and further instructions awaited.</p>

<p>Intended to Open Fire on Guarding Police Officer</p>
<p>Police officer Li Ming'an of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, stationed at the intersection of Xibao Xing Road and Tiantong An Road in Zhabei, was on duty at around 10 PM the previous night when he saw a man running towards him. At the same time, cries for help were heard behind the man. Officer Li, realizing that something was amiss and seeing the man's panicked expression, ordered him to stop. The man, in a state of frenzy, pulled out a handgun, intending to fire at the officer. Fortunately, Officer Li reacted quickly, grabbing him from behind and disarming him. He was taken into custody. Under interrogation, the man identified himself as Wang A'gen, 34 years old, from Changshu. He had planned to rob someone on Baoxing Road that evening with an accomplice, Ding Youmei, but the plan had been discovered by the intended victim. He claimed that Ding Youmei was currently employed as a cook at the residence of a Russian dentist at No. 640 Avenue Joffre, Rue Massenet, French Concession. After obtaining this confession, the district office sent a letter to the French police, requesting them to apprehend Ding at the given address. Ding was apprehended and taken into custody. He confessed that he knew Wang but denied any knowledge of Wang's plans. He claimed that Wang A'gen had committed several robberies in the city in the past, had been sentenced to over eight years in prison, and had recently been released. He claimed that he had been falsely accused because Wang had been refused a loan and was holding a grudge. After verifying the confessions, the police ordered that they be temporarily detained and transferred to the City Public Security Bureau for joint investigation.</p>

<p>Murderer Zhang Jinbao, also known as "Long-legged Jinbao," from Yixing, was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment by the Second Special District Court for killing Gu Daosheng from Dachang at the Daji Lou restaurant outside Xiaodongmen in the French Concession in March of last year. Zhang appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court, where the case is currently under third instance review. He is being held in the detention center. However, Zhang has not shown any remorse. On the 9th of last month, he had an argument with fellow inmates Chen Zikang and Huang Hanan over cigarettes. When guard Zhu Fubao intervened, Zhang not only refused to comply but also punched Zhu, causing injury. Zhu reported this to the warden, who ordered Zhang to be shackled and transferred to the Second Special District Court Procuratorate for investigation. This was previously reported. Prosecutor Wang Ren has completed the investigation and filed a public prosecution with the same-level criminal court, charging him with obstructing official duties under the Criminal Code. Yesterday, Judge Sun Penghao, along with Prosecutor Wang, convened the Sixth Criminal Court to interrogate Zhang. First, the prosecutor stated the grounds for the prosecution, followed by Zhu Fubao's account of the assault. Zhang Jinbao vehemently denied the assault. The court summoned the warden, Director Wu, and inmate Huang Hanan for questioning and adjourned the hearing to the 11th for further witness testimony. Zhang was returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Achievements of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Gu Baiyan <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Gu Baiyan is known for his profound medical knowledge and extensive experience. He is particularly skilled in treating lung disease with hemoptysis, liver and stomach ailments, neurasthenia, kidney deficiency with spermatorrhea, prenatal and postpartum conditions, and menstrual irregularities due to blood deficiency. He is also quite adept at pediatric medicine. Last month, the eldest son of Mr. Fang Maohua, an employee of this newspaper, fell ill with a high fever all over his body, which worsened at night, causing restlessness and delirious speech, excessive thirst and urination, and extreme irritability. He was treated by renowned pediatricians and repeatedly by massage experts for over twenty days, all to no avail. The child, only three years old, became increasingly weak, and his condition deteriorated daily. Mr. Fang was extremely anxious. Subsequently, according to friends, Gu Baiyan, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner at 46 Heng'an Lane, Nanyang Bridge, outside the West Gate of this city, possessed medical ethics and skills unlike ordinary doctors, meticulously diagnosing illnesses and carefully prescribing medication. Seeing his son's worsening condition, Mr. Fang consulted him. Unexpectedly, after three doses, the fever gradually subsided; after six doses, the facial flushing disappeared; and after eight doses, the excessive thirst and urination stopped. He is now completely recovered. This illness was a case of latent heat. If not treated properly, it would have developed into consumption, threatening his life. Fortunately, he encountered a good doctor like Gu, who was able to bring him back to health from a serious illness.</p>

<p>The Xinmin News Agency was founded eight years ago and has been registered with the Shanghai Municipal Party Department. The current president is Cheng Xingzhi, and the reporter is Mr. Min Lianqin. Although the scale is relatively small, its contribution to the news industry is not insignificant. Recently, the agency read in the newspaper that Mr. Tang was planning to establish the Xinmin Telegraph Agency, scheduled to begin operations on September 1st. The agency immediately had its legal counsel, Mr. Yu Xiangqin, send a letter to the telegraph agency, requesting that it change the name "Xinmin" to avoid confusion. Because newspapers often abbreviate news sources to "Mou Mou She" (lit. So-and-So Agency), without distinguishing between "Tongxun" (news) and "Dianxun" (telegraph), the first two characters are crucial and must not be the same. This is obvious. Since Mr. Tang is also working hard for the news industry, he should also share the same enthusiasm for protecting the long-standing Xinmin News Agency and immediately change the name of his telegraph agency.</p>

<p>Shanghai has a large population, and although there is no shortage of Chinese and Western doctors, there are few traditional Chinese medicine practitioners specializing in skin diseases, which is insufficient to meet the treatment needs. The owner of Bao He Tang on North Sichuan Road, to alleviate the suffering of compatriots, has specially hired Huang Zhenwen, a renowned skin disease doctor from Guangzhou, to reside at the pharmacy and offer free consultations. Dr. Huang Zhenwen is the son of Huang Hezhou, a veteran doctor who founded the Guangxi City Western Charity Hospital and the Huihang Charity Hospital. He has a solid family foundation and has studied extensively. He graduated from Guanghua Medical School and has a thorough understanding of both Chinese and Western medicine. He has served as the director of surgery at various charity hospitals and has practiced in Guangzhou for over twenty years. He has experience in treating carbuncles, ophthalmic, ear, nose, and throat conditions. Therefore, shortly after arriving in Shanghai, he has been sought out by many patients. Because Dr. Huang's time at Bao He Tang is limited, he has established a clinic at 36 Sande Lane, Haining Road, telephone number 43348, to better serve the public.</p>

<p>Guangdong native Wen Jianqing was assaulted by a Westerner named Xiao Po and an Indian. The Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai has submitted a letter to the Xinzha Police, requesting negotiations to punish the perpetrators and maintain order. The original letter is as follows: To the Xinzha Police: Recently, our fellow townsman Wen Jianqing wrote, stating that on August 28th, Jianqing went to the Dahua apartment on Jing'an Temple Road to visit his aunt and deliver a letter. The doorman, an Indian (Hazara Singh) (Surla Singh), and a Westerner named Xiao Po, assaulted him without reason, injuring his internal organs and causing him to faint. Bystanders, feeling indignant, immediately called the police to arrest the assailants. Jianqing was then taken by police car to the Red Cross for treatment. Details can be found in the August 29th edition of the Times. Jianqing is a poor scholar who has suffered serious injuries, is unable to seek redress, and lacks funds for treatment. Knowing that your esteemed association has a long-standing commitment to helping fellow townsmen, we respectfully request permission to admit him to the Guangdong Civil Hospital for free treatment and also request that you promptly send a letter to the police to arrest and punish the perpetrators, which would not only be fortunate for Jianqing personally but for all three million fellow townsmen in Shanghai. In response to this, we have verified that our fellow townsman Wen Jianqing was indeed assaulted. Such barbaric and illegal behavior by the Indian and Westerner cannot be tolerated. We have arranged for Wen Jianqing to be admitted to the Guangdong Civil Hospital for treatment and accordingly request that your esteemed police promptly arrest the assailants, severely punish them in accordance with the law, uphold human life, and maintain order. We await your response with great anticipation. This letter is addressed to the Xinzha Police by the Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Since its establishment over twenty years ago, the Universal Goodness Villa has consistently undertaken benevolent deeds such as burying the exposed and providing medical treatment, which are genuinely significant in relation to public health. However, it has always lacked designated funds and relies entirely on the enthusiastic assistance of philanthropists from all walks of life. Director Mr. Wang Junsheng exerts his utmost to fulfill his duties and meticulously plans everything, taking great pains. According to records, in August of this year, a total of 113 large coffins and 3,412 small coffins were collected and buried in the Chinese and foreign concessions. Among these, 52 large coffins and 1,969 small coffins were from the Villa itself, 6 large coffins from the Chinese Red Cross Society, 6 large coffins from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, 1 large coffin from the Emergency Epidemic Hospital, and 1 large coffin from the Tongren Hospital. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession issued permits for the burial of 47 large coffins and 445 small coffins within the concession. The Xieqiao branch villa and various charitable halls in the French Concession collected 1,008 small coffins. A total of 1,398 large and small coffins were distributed. The New People's Road White Cross Universal Goodness Hospital provided medical treatment and medication to a total of 5,248 patients. Furthermore, over the years, 77,736 exposed corpses have been buried in the Jiangzhe area, and preparations are still underway to continue this effort. However, the expenses for these various projects are enormous, and it is hoped that all sectors will generously provide assistance to jointly support this benevolent undertaking, the merits of which are immeasurable.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang raised a question about women's self-study, asking why married women are unwilling to study. Today, we will first present the primary reason for women's decline after marriage, which is the lack of social economic status, in response to Mr. Wang's question. When the manuscript was being copied that day, the clerk made a mistake and wrote Liu Xunyue instead of Wang Yuqi. This is hereby clarified. Editor</p>
<p>On the positive side, women cannot find the use of knowledge in society. On the negative side, they are burdened by household affairs. Household affairs are the chains that bind all women, and the greatest subjective cause of eroding women's desire for knowledge. Many people believe that women are physiologically inferior to men, but this is not the reality. Women's inferiority to men is due to the iron chains of household affairs placed around their necks. After the trap of "men managing external affairs and women managing internal affairs" has been set, it has become impossible. With the burden of household affairs, women become slaves to the family, slaves to men, and household puppets with no possible activities other than bearing and raising children and serving their husbands. This kind of bondage firmly holds women, whether in the old Chinese joint family or in the fashionable one-husband-one-wife new family. For example, in a new-style family, can women not bear children? Can they not raise children? Even if laundry and cooking can be hired out to maids, the task of directing and managing those so-called household chores still falls to the housewife herself, not to the man. Even if we step back and say that all household affairs can be delegated, because of the burden of household affairs and the fact that family values, under the support of tradition, cannot be shaken off for a time, the relationship between men and women cannot but be built on the family, with the family as the only goal for men and women to pursue together, and with the family as the bond of love between men and women after marriage. If the family breaks up, everything is over between men and women! In this way, neither men nor women are willing to disrupt the peace of the family unless absolutely necessary. As the housewife, the woman is forced to let her neck be chained within this yoke, even just for eating and sleeping.</p>
<p>If women are to become members of society, they must step out of the narrow confines of the family and attend to the world at the same time. We believe that the relationship between women and men should be a combination of sincere love, and this love should be built on mutual aid, mutual understanding, and efforts in social undertakings. In this way, women become completely free people, completely independent people, and, like men, can only seek their survival in academics and careers. May I ask, what things that men can do cannot they do? Why would they not work hard to acquire advanced knowledge as a weapon for survival?</p>
<p>In China, the family system naturally has many more drawbacks than in Europe and the United States, and a virtuous wife and good mother have always been regarded as divinely ordained. Women not only cannot become members of society, but even the little bit of rights they previously fought for, such as going to school and public socializing, are now in danger of being lost. This phenomenon can be seen everywhere at present. It is naturally not uncommon for people like Mr. Liu's friend to give books on social science to his woman to read, and for another person to hope that his woman can study literature with him, but this is definitely not the general situation. Many young gentlemen are afraid that their wives will show their faces in public and enter society, and even before they can complete their studies, they sever all their contact with society.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fact that women do not seek to improve themselves after marriage cannot simply be blamed on women's own depravity, but there are major objective reasons for this. If we want to solve the issue of women's self-study after marriage, we must start by fundamentally resolving the contradictions between their living environment and their thoughts.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, establishing women's social status and independent economic rights, as well as liberating them from household affairs, is the primary meaning of women's liberation. It is the main condition for women to be able to obtain true equality and freedom in their careers and studies. However, this is related to the entire social reform problem and cannot be achieved with a single move. Here, it can only serve as a goal for people who are concerned about women's liberation and women's self-study issues to strive for.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we can talk about is only how to make their lives conducive to the conditions for self-study. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Considering that the current railway freight rates for agricultural products are high, those of the second class such as lychees, longans, raw silk, etc; those of the relatively low fourth class such as various fruits (except for a portion with special prices) and Lingbao cotton, Shaanxi cotton, etc; and those of the lowest fifth class such as rice, wheat, grains (except for a portion with special prices) and Tongzhou cotton, Taicang cotton, Hankou cotton, Jiangxi cotton, etc. In general, the method of determining freight rates is based on the distance of the journey, with higher rates for shorter distances. The longer the mileage, the lower the freight rate per ton per kilometer. Those transported on this line all adopt the principle of decreasing distance. Those transported by joint transport of each lines, there are even percentage rates of decreasing distance for joint transport freight rates, that is, after five hundred and one kilometers, a reduction of one percent is collected according to the fixed amount, and from then on, for every one hundred kilometers, a reduction of one percent is collected, up to a full journey exceeding two thousand five hundred kilometers to reduce collection by twenty percent, And the so-called joint transport freight rate is the total amount of freight calculated by each line. Considering the reasons, it is nothing more than taking care of the transportation costs of each line. Therefore, the freight rates of each line have not been able to be unified, and all agricultural products related to the rural economy, except for those included in special prices, can only be calculated according to the fixed rate to calculate the freight. This situation, at first glance, seems to be fair, but upon closer inspection, it is not enough to be reasonable, (1) For the same goods traveling a distance of 500 kilometers, if transported jointly by Lines A and B, the freight rate per ton is 20 silver yuan. If transported jointly by Lines B and C, due to the different transportation costs of Lines A and C, it may increase to 30 silver yuan per ton. Using the same goods traveling the same mileage, and shouldering freight rates that differ greatly, how can it be said to be level, (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e192">Recent Measures by the Japanese Puppets to Implement Enslavement Education in the Northeast <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲Using Students of All Levels as Propaganda Tools</p>
<p>▲Changes in the School System and Salary Cuts for Elementary School Teachers and Staff</p>
<p>▲Traitors Mindlessly Display Their Skills to Please the Japanese</p>
<p>(Shenyang News from the Northeast Agency) The actual power of education in the puppet Manchukuo is entirely in the hands of the Japanese, so that they can promote their youth enslavement strategy as much as possible. They are actively seeking to improve the friendship between Japanese and "Manchurian" education in order to achieve their purpose of using our youth. From elementary school, they are administering their anesthetic education, hoping to instill in them, through what they see and hear, a completely pro-Japanese and slavish mentality. The puppet organization has recently revised its new education policy. The Liaoning puppet education authorities are also using young people to promote their so-called "Wangdao spirit," hoping to deeply infiltrate people's hearts. Looking at the educational farce of enslaving the Northeast that they have been staging, new tricks are emerging one after another. The recent misdeeds of the Japanese puppets in education are described below:</p>
<h3 id="e193">Meetings and Propaganda <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The Liaoning Province Puppet Education Department held the Eastern Border Road Education-Related Public Security Work Committee in Shanchengzhen on the 25th of last month. Those present at the time, in addition to the traitor Wei, the puppet Education Director, included Inspector Morita (a Japanese) and several section chiefs of the department. The content of this meeting was that the Eastern Border Road area has long been a base for the activities of the Volunteer Army, and is an important obstacle to the public security of the puppet organization. Therefore, after the work of suppressing the Volunteer Army in the Eastern Border area, propaganda work should also be carried out at the same time. Those attending the meeting also included county magistrates, Japanese consultants, and education bureau chiefs from various counties in the Eastern Border Road, totaling no less than 50 people. The result of the meeting was that the population of each county in the Eastern Border Road is about 400,000 to 500,000, and each county education bureau has about 30 to 40 schools and other cultural institutions under its jurisdiction. According to statistics, there are more than 60,000 students in each county. Among the residents, there is one student for every eight people. The method of propaganda is to enable students to have a full understanding of the "puppet state" and an understanding of the Wangdao spirit, so that they can propagate it in rural areas in order to achieve quick and easy results. Therefore, the education in the Eastern Border Road will adopt this policy of using students for propaganda and actively carry it out, in order to spread slave propaganda throughout the region, so that the people of Liaodong will forever be tamed by the Japanese invaders and will not be allowed to harbor national ideas.</p>
<h3 id="e194">System Changes and Salary Cuts <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Since the first year of Kangde, the Puppet Ministry of Education has been actively changing the education policy of the puppet organization with the aim of fundamentally creating enslaved youth. The Puppet "Fengtian" Education Department first implemented the first step of the new education policy, changing the elementary school single-class grade system to a combined system, so as to use fewer teachers and facilitate the saving of funds. The first to implement the combined teaching system were the male and female sections of the First Normal School Affiliated Elementary School. The Puppet Education Authorities believe that adopting a combined system is most suitable within the puppet organization, and that receiving children of different grades in one class and teaching them in sequence can not only save educational expenses but also take up less classroom space. This is truly a means for the Japanese puppets to reduce education. In addition, the issue of salary reductions for principals and staff of elementary schools operated by the Liaoning Puppet Municipal Government has now been finalized as follows: the principal's monthly salary is 120 yuan, senior grade teachers 65 yuan, senior subject teachers 60 yuan, junior grade teachers 60 yuan, junior subject teachers 54 yuan, and clerks remain the same. All of the above teachers have had their original salaries reduced by 10 percent, and this has been implemented across the board starting in August.</p>

<p>The Japanese Puppet Joint Art Exhibition is scheduled to be held in mid-September, taking place in the three main locations of the puppet capital Changchun, Liaoning, and Harbin in rotation one after another. The "Fengtian Province" Puppet Education Department therefore convened a meeting of relevant parties a few months ago to discuss the method of soliciting exhibits. To date, no fewer than 3,000 pieces of exhibits have been received, all of which are the work of well-known calligraphy and painting experts in the province. It is reported that the deadline for soliciting exhibits is the 22nd, and all exhibits must be completely sent to "Xinjing" before the 25th for review and selection, so as to be displayed and exhibited at that time. Local traitors of calligraphy and painting and the like are vying to present exhibits, hoping to win the praise of the Japanese as the highest honor.</p>

<p>The provincial primary schools of Jiangsu Province have always paid great attention to experimental research. Recently, in view of the fact that the experimental research of each school is carried out independently, resulting in duplication and inefficiency, they considered ways to control it.  Therefore, the organization of the Experimental Research Committee was established.  It is now learned that the meeting is scheduled to be held at the Shanghai Experimental Primary School of Jiangsu Province on Shangwen Road, Shanghai, starting at 9:00 am on September 9th. The directors of experimental research from the provincial primary schools will all attend to discuss everything.</p>

<p>(1) These equipment standards were formulated by the Curriculum and Equipment Standards Compilation Committee of the Ministry of Education based on or with reference to the following materials: (1) The junior high school zoology and botany curriculum standards and the senior high school biology curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry; (2) The opinions of various authors; (3) The opinions of domestic biologists and botanists; (4) The opinions of domestic middle school biology teachers and botany and zoology teachers.</p>
<p>(2) These standards are divided into the following seven types. The first three types are permanent equipment, and the last four types are temporary materials that need to be added annually. (1) Instruments, (2) Preserved Specimens, (3) Charts or Models, (4) Live Specimens, (5) Reagents, (6) Glassware, (7) Other Supplies.</p>
<p>(3) These standards list thirty-two senior high school biology student experiments to comply with the Ministry-promulgated curriculum standards of one experiment per week.</p>
<p>(4) Sixteen student experiments are listed for each of junior high school botany and zoology.</p>
<p>(5) The various botany, zoology, and biology equipment listed in these standards are determined as the quantities required for selecting experiments for one class of students. As for the number of students in a class, it is divided into four groups of five students each, with twenty students as the standard.</p>
<p>(6) These standards propose both ordinary and minimum quantities.</p>
<p>(7) The quantity of reagents is determined based on the convenience of purchase, so it is slightly more than actually needed.</p>
<p>(8) When demonstrating, models are more realistic than charts, but the price of models is more than ten times higher than charts. If schools have financial difficulties, they can use charts.</p>
<p>(9) In addition to common live specimens, efforts should be made to cultivate them in the laboratory or nearby, and display them at all times for observation.</p>
<p>(10) The preserved specimens listed in these standards are the minimum teaching equipment. Schools should add other specimens as much as possible according to local conditions.</p>

<p>(Shanghai Society) The Business Management Design Committee, initiated and organized by the China Vocational Education Society, held its inaugural meeting and first regular meeting at the Society yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Attending Committee Members: Huang Renzhi, Xu Changqing, Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, Qin Hancai, Yao Zhongliang, He Qingru, Yao Huiquan, Jia Foru, Wang Yinfo, Wen Chonglu, Shi Yangyong, Yang Chonggao, Huang Zhuming. Chairman Jiang Wenyu, Recorder Shi Yangyong.</p>
<p>▲ Business Management: First, Huang Renzhi expressed specific opinions on business management, saying that he has recently become most interested in scientific management. In the past, various organizations rarely paid attention to business affairs. It should be known that the scope of business affairs is the largest and the relationship is the most important. For example, documentation, accounting, and general affairs all belong to the business aspect. Currently, there are special books for the study of documentation and accounting, and special lectures, but the general affairs aspect is uniquely lacking. There is a real need for research and training. The training steps should first determine the methods and then start training talents. It is hoped to create a well-defined path that ordinary people can rely on and learn from. In his personal opinion, the solution to this problem has the following points: (1) Determine the target, such as schools, factories, and administrative agencies, and discuss them separately. (2) Determine the scope, such as specifically referring to general affairs. (3) Analyze the parts, such as procurement management, workers, storage of goods, internal and external cleanliness, meeting arrangements, food handling, house repairs, and temporary events such as fire, sudden illness, and theft. (4) Specify the steps, such as procurement requiring the opening of the product name, explaining the purpose, the required date, after approval, using what method (either bidding or purchasing), drawing a formal invoice, etc. (5) Provide various major forms or documents, such as procurement procedures, storage ledgers, management of workers' essentials, handling emergency alarms, etc. If the methods can be studied in detail and concrete methods can be obtained, then it will not be difficult to further seek talent training.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: After Huang's presentation of specific opinions, Xu Changqing, Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, He Qingru, and others successively expressed their opinions. At the end, the proposals were discussed: (1) Proposal to nominate members to organize the opinions of the committee members, decided to nominate Huang Renzhi, He Qingru, Xu Changqing, Jia Foru, and Shi Yangyong to take charge. (2) Proposal for the date of the next meeting, decided to hold it at 3:00 PM this Saturday. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>The Great China Middle School on Fanwangdu Road in this city is a complete middle school affiliated with Great China University. It currently has three grades of junior high school, six grades of senior high school with a general course of study, five grades of business, four grades of civil engineering, and three grades of teacher training, with more than 600 male and female students in total. The school recently built an office building on the west side of the university, and two classroom buildings, including general classrooms, science classrooms, and work classrooms, totaling dozens of rooms. All equipment, lighting, ventilation, etc. are in accordance with the latest education standards. The school is located outside the city in western Shanghai, originally with a rural flavor, the Liva Lita River and newly opened sports field surround the new school buildings, making the scenery even better. Starting this year, the school will be stricter in teaching and guidance, hoping to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere. It is also heard that the school is scheduled to register on the 7th and 8th, and classes will begin in the new school buildings on the 10th.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Freshman Orientation Week at Ginling Women's University <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>New students often feel the pain of unfamiliarity with the place and the people. Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Nanjing has taken this into consideration, so it holds a freshman orientation week every year, which has been quite effective. This year, the school opened on the 3rd of this month. At 7:30 PM that evening, the faculty and staff held a welcome meeting for the new students, so that there would be opportunities for recognition between teachers and students. On the morning of the 4th, there was a lecture on curriculum planning and a tour of the school buildings. In the afternoon, a film was shown (the film was self-made by a Western professor) so that students would know the scenery of the capital and Ginling life. On the 5th, physical examinations were conducted and registration procedures and library usage methods were explained. On the 6th, physical fitness tests and concerts were held. On the 7th, registration and payment of fees were handled, etc. On the 8th, there was a guided tour of the capital's famous scenic spots. The purpose is to enable new students to understand the content and environment of the school, and to eliminate the pain of unfamiliarity with the place and people. Such a method is rarely held in domestic universities, so it is specially recorded above. It is heard that formal classes are scheduled to begin on the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>Wang Qingqi, a businessman from southern Guangdong, deeply feels that the weakness of the country is mostly due to the decline of education. In order to remedy the situation where the poor are unable to afford education, he has long planned to establish compulsory schools. Yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai to inspect business in various places and specially sold off more than 100 mu of his private property in Guizhou Province and donated it to the Shanghai East Commercial Vocational School, and designated it as the school's construction fund.</p>

<p>▲ Director Pan Delivers a Speech Introducing Graduates</p>
<p>This year, the Municipal Education Bureau and Chen Bao jointly run the High School of Commerce. Since the enrollment began, there has been an endless stream of applicants. It is now scheduled to hold a class placement test on the 8th and formally start classes on the 10th. According to Director Pan, who enthusiastically advocates production education, this city is the commercial center of the country, and there is a great lack of junior and intermediate commercial personnel, resulting in different supply and demand. Therefore, it was decided to concentrate the strength of various agencies to establish a High School of Commerce, on the one hand, to cultivate the skills of those who want to engage in business, and on the other hand, to increase their knowledge. In order to realize this, the curriculum will be strictly compiled, with equal emphasis on learning and application, and graduation will be required in one year. In addition to being retained by the two agencies, graduates will also make every effort to introduce them to society.</p>

<p>Mingguang Middle School: Since Chairman Wu Xingya and Principal Tang Zengyang took office at Mingguang Middle School at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Jiaozhou Road in this city, they have strived to enrich the equipment of sports equipment, physics and chemistry instruments, books and specimens, etc. The school buildings and playgrounds have been expanded. The teaching methods have been revised, and teaching and training are required to be strict. The curriculum is based on the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, and funds are being actively raised to build school buildings. Now the school's middle school department and Guoben Primary School have already started, and the surge in new students has exceeded expectations.</p>
<p>Navigation Confinement Center: This semester, the Cihang Confinement School at the north end of Kangnaot Road, Hede Road in this city is presided over by Mr. Wang Xuequan. The opening ceremony was held yesterday, with more than 100 new and old students and all faculty and staff of the school attending. Chairman Wang Xuequan reported on the administrative policy for this semester and encouraged students to work hard to cultivate themselves for future application. The end of the speech was delivered by the school's faculty and staff Hu Zhiyuan, Wang Bingquan, Li Yongzhong, Chen Weifan, etc. It is heard that the school has recently received letters from distant students requesting permission to be integrated into the school, several times a day. In order to facilitate the students, the authorities have approved them one by one.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce School: The Chinese typing class of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce School at Tianhou Temple Bridge has been established for four years. The school authorities believe that the structure of the Chinese typewriter is complex, and there is a lack of real professional talents in this area in society. In order to facilitate manual writing and clear official documents, and to enhance German learning technology, they can patiently induce students in the methods of teaching disassembly and repair, spelling, copying, and use, so that each student can achieve considerable results. Many have been entrusted to register and introduce them to serve banks, companies, and communities, not less than dozens of people. It is recently heard that the class will continue to recruit new male and female students from now on. Anyone with general knowledge can sign up for admission, preferential treatment will be given to poor children, and the skills of Chinese typing will be promoted, so the fees are also very low. In recent days, the reports have been very enthusiastic, and there are not many places left.</p>
<p>World Literature Correspondence College: The World Literature Correspondence College at No. 5, Penglai Li, Zhonghua Road, West Gate, Shanghai, is hosted by the Crazy Current Literature Society and has been established for many years. Recently, the college has been actively expanding. In addition to the chief of general affairs, the college has hired a Bachelor of Arts, Xie Guanjun, as the secretary-general, and Xie Zhonghua as the director. The college will also add more than ten departments and will hold a national literary youth art competition and expand the library, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e210">The Issue of Civic Education in National Revival (4) Zhang Yuangruo <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Speaking again of "rites", Westerners are polite everywhere. For example, when walking on the road, if they bump into someone, foreigners do not care whether you bump me, or I bump you. They are all very polite and say sorry. If Chinese people bump into someone, they will start scolding and fighting, without any manners. At the same time, when foreigners buy things, they do not rush to be first, but go in one by one in order, just like primary school students lining up in a neat team. These are all manifestations of their rites, and also the reason why their society is orderly. Finally, speaking of "trust", the Westerners' spirit of keeping promises can best be shown at banquets. Chinese people are very different. Even if they are invited to dinner at six o'clock, they will not start until ten o'clock. Because the Western countries have these four virtues, their people can be loving and united. In other words, the reason why their nations can unite is that the four things of benevolence, righteousness, rites, and trust are used to unite them. However, these four virtues are the inherent doctrines of our country. In recent years, although there have been constant calls for unity in China, we are still unable to unite today. This is because the social morality of benevolence, righteousness, rites, and trust, which is inherent in our country, has not been promoted. Looking back at the social morality of benevolence, righteousness, rites, and trust in Western countries, it has developed so well, so they can unite, can work hard, and sacrifice for the country, for the nation, for society, and for others. Therefore, their nations can generate strength and create the wealth and strength of their nations. How should we reflect deeply?</p>
<p>Third, the spirit of diligence of the people. The people of Western countries are generally very diligent and thrifty. You must not think that Western material civilization is so developed, so you want to consume and enjoy it. You must know that the true meaning of material civilization is to create material, use material, not to enjoy material, and waste material. Chinese people generally only know how to enjoy and waste material, but do not create and use material. They are really criminals of material civilization. Western material civilization is so developed, but their people's spirit of hard work, thrift, cherishing material resources, and creating material is far beyond what we can reach. This is not the source of their wealth and strength. I have never been willing to praise Western nations, but this spirit is indeed worthy of admiration. They sit in a bright and brilliant environment, but are generally very diligent and thrifty, more diligent and thrifty than we are in suffering and hardship. When I was in Belgium, I saw the living conditions of their people. The life of a middle-class family is quite difficult. Breakfast is just a few slices of bread and a cup of coffee. Lunch is just one or two dishes. The evening is as simple as breakfast, but they are very diligent in doing things. They get up at dawn and do not use servants. All rough and fine work is done by themselves. In the period of national crisis, the general people, especially the people in the cities, still do not know how to strive, and still do not get up until the sun is high. They live together all day long, without mentioning righteousness, indulging in consumption, and not engaging in proper business. Some even advocate the strange theories of "dancing to save the country" and "entertainment to save the country". How can we seek the revival of the nation? I hope that the authorities will make practical corrections to this kind of decadence.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of the situation of the Japanese nation, the development of the Japanese nation also has three reasons. Although these three reasons are not exactly the same as those of Europe and the United States, they are also similar.</p>
<p>First, "Japanese Obsession" - The Japanese people's national consciousness is like hypnosis, as if they are obsessed. So it is called "Japanese Obsession". This can be divided into three points:</p>
<p>(1) Believing in the Country. They say that the Great Japanese Empire is created by gods, and is an unparalleled Great Empire that stands tall in the world.</p>
<p>(2) Believing in the Nation. They say that the Japanese nation is chosen for them by gods. The Japanese nation is the most outstanding nation in the world, so they desperately protect their nation, even if they are clearly wrong, they still desperately fight with others.</p>
<p>(3) Believing in the Imperial Lineage. The slogan of the Japanese Restoration is to respect the emperor and expel the barbarians. They believe that their Emperor is the only ruler in the world, and everyone absolutely supports him.</p>
<p>Because of this "Japanese Obsession", the Japanese nation produced the above three results, and his nation therefore generated an undeniable power.</p>
<p>Second, Bushido. Bushido is the driving force of the Japanese Restoration movement. Its spirit is a struggle for life, a struggle for the survival of the nation and the country. Because of this spirit of struggle, they produced their "life of blood and tears". Blood is the spirit of bloodshed and sacrifice for their monarch and the nation. Tears are the spirit of loving and caring for their people. The Japanese people, living in this kind of struggle for life and life of blood and tears, are therefore dictatorial internally and able to resist externally. This is the second reason why the Japanese nation is strong.</p>
<p>Third, Passionate Emotions. There are also three spirits expressed from the Japanese people's passionate emotions:</p>
<p>(1) The Genuineness of Faith. The Japanese nation's faith is very firm, which is the Japanese obsession I just said, as if they were hypnotized.</p>
<p>(2) Struggling for the Greater Self. Being able to sacrifice the lesser self to struggle for the greater self.</p>
<p>(3) Not Planning. This is also a good thing about the Japanese nation. Chinese people always consider and plan for their personal interests first when they encounter something. If there is something unfavorable to themselves, they refuse to do it. As for asking them to struggle and sacrifice for the country and the nation, that is even more impossible. But the Japanese are different. They never plan for themselves, and are willing to take responsibility and sacrifice bravely. We remember that during the Russo-Japanese War, they encountered a river that they could not cross. They never planned and scrambled to fill the river, allowing their troops to cross it. They not only did not retreat, but also thought it was more glorious to be buried underneath. This shows the Japanese people's spirit of not planning, being responsible, and sacrificing bravely.</p>
<p>The Japanese have a sincere faith, so they can not plan. Because they do not plan, they can be very responsible and bravely struggle and sacrifice for the greater self. The Japanese nation, because its people have this kind of passionate emotion, generates passionate power. This is the third reason why the Japanese nation is strong.</p>
<p>Fourth, the main principles of civic education in our country in the future. Now I have roughly spoken about the causes of the rise and fall of various nations in ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. From these many objective and obvious longitudinal historical traces and horizontal world affairs, we can summarize the important principles that should be paid attention to in the future civic education of our country. I do not admit that these principles are any new theories. They can only be regarded as platitudes. Do not think that platitudes are bad. You must know that the most valuable things in the world are platitudes. Platitudes are just like everyday meals. We eat three meals a day. Have we ever gotten tired of eating them? In our natural physiology, we cannot take strange things as our daily food. Similarly, in the physiology of society, we cannot use strange theories to treat the masses as experimental animals. Fine wine is beautiful, but it can hurt the body. Heretical sayings can mislead people and ruin the country. Therefore, those who are truly hygienic will never be greedy for pleasure. Those who can truly serve the country with loyalty will never sing high-sounding tunes. Based on this belief, I believe that the main principles of civic education in our country in the future should be based on the following three points:</p>
<p>First, enlightening national consciousness. To enlighten national consciousness, I think we should at least follow the following points as creeds:</p>

<p>▲Track and Field Events Decided, Basketball Still Uncertain</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 5th Dispatch) The 11th World Games will be held in Berlin in two years. China will participate in the event, with the Sports Advancement Association's board of directors appointing Ma Yuehan, Huan Dunli, and Shen Siliang to prepare. Regarding the method for preliminary selection of representatives, Ma et al. have drafted guidelines. As the South China football team has a long-standing reputation, it was decided to send them to represent China. Basketball is also planned, but there is no certainty of success; whether to send a team is yet to be determined. For track and field, it has been decided to only participate in the 100-meter and 200-meter events, and the number of representatives and expenses are difficult to determine at this time.</p>

<p>Track and Field and Other Work Stalled</p>
<p>Due to Unfinalized Lease Contract</p>
<p>Since moving to Zhongyuan, the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association, while acknowledging the temporary nature of the site, is still working hard in light of the needs of sports. According to a Shen Shi News reporter's investigation yesterday, the construction of the association's track and field and basketball facilities is still stalled. This is because the lease contract has not been fully agreed upon. It is possible that the Shenyuan side may reclaim the land after the originally stipulated lease term expires. However, given the sluggish market and increasingly severe economic downturn, the association can at least maintain its operations for a certain period. It is also possible that the contract can be finalized in the near future. The association is currently starting to prepare for football matters, as the season is approaching and time is pressing. The organization is generally the same as the previous session. Although the one football field is considered insufficient, it can still be used with some difficulty.</p>

<p>A Few Words of Contribution</p>
<h3 id="e215">Three Small Gifts to仰葊 <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>▲Dedicated to the Leaders of Domestic Goods Factories</p>
<p>When considering the current state of domestic goods, there are countless complexities, but the key points are simply these three:</p>
<p>(1) How to reduce costs? For the same product, why do others make money while we lose money? For the same piece of yarn, why can others make money selling it for 160 yuan, while we lose money selling it for 180 yuan? For the same bolt of cloth, we always lose money selling it for three yuan, while others profit selling it for two yuan? Sometimes, even drinking ginger soup to warm our stomachs, we say they have government subsidies, but in reality, there is no such thing. We constantly say they are dumping and selling at low prices, but no one in the world does business at a loss. They are willing to sell cheaply because they have their own clever methods. First, cheaper raw materials; second, sophisticated and well-maintained machinery; third, reduced labor; fourth, dedicated work; and fifth, no embezzlement by administrators. Government assistance means convenient transportation and thorough protection. Banker assistance means low interest rates. Academic assistance means in-depth research and significant contributions. With efforts from all sides, results will naturally follow. This is the first key.</p>
<p>(2) How to improve products? For the same product, why do others innovate, constantly changing patterns and coming up with new designs, making good things even better and refined things even more refined, while we remain the same? Naturally, we will either not advance or regress. Ordinary people always like novelty. If, for the sake of promoting domestic goods, we insist on forcing people to use old-fashioned items, it is not reasonable. Therefore, factory products should follow the principle of "If one day is new, then make it new again, truly every day new," as stated in the Great Learning, to defeat foreigners and maintain stable profits. Otherwise, if we only promote domestic goods verbally, it will eventually become annoying. To improve products, first, recruit specialized technicians; second, pay attention to production machinery; and third, have excellent designs, constant research, and continuous observation and investigation to seek continuous improvement. Is it really impossible to catch up with others?</p>
<p>(3) How to increase production? For the same factory, others can manufacture quickly and produce in large quantities. Our common problem is that we often fail to deliver goods on time. When sales are brisk, we have no goods to sell. By the time we have more goods, the season has passed. How can we calculate the losses in this situation? I visited Kangyuan, Wuhe, and other factories the other day. Their manufacturing is calculated with extreme accuracy. When to start the machine, when to deliver the goods, with only a few minutes of difference. Know that with the same capital, the same workers, the same machines, and the same expenses, how much difference is there between fast and slow? This all depends on strict organization, planning, clear rewards and punishments, and accurate auditing. From the organizers to the junior staff and trainees, they must have undergone scientific training and have a scientific mindset.</p>
<p>Talks on Domestic Goods</p>
<h3 id="e216">Silver Exports and Domestic Goods <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Xing</p>
<p>Since January of this year, China has successively experienced large-scale silver exports. Economists have written articles discussing the advantages and disadvantages. We ignorant small citizens, of course, cannot understand the profoundness. Even if we have any good contributions, we cannot get the adoption of the great gentlemen!</p>
<p>However, since the 21st of last month, there have been consecutive large-scale silver exports, with workers rushing to make silver boxes overnight and carrying them away in a hurry... all kinds of news have been published. It is said that "the total amount is 100 million yuan."</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's editorial on August 26th said in the last paragraph: "...Let's take a look at how abundant the silver that Shanghai Chinese banks have collected from the interior in recent years is, and how it shows the concentration of funds. Then look at the state of urban and rural areas. I'm afraid no one will have a satisfactory conclusion! If this is the case, even if silver never flows out and is piled up in the vaults, can our national economy make any progress?" Indeed, in the eyes of us who do not understand economics, silver exports certainly have considerable benefits. Otherwise, would the smart banking community do such a stupid thing?</p>
<p>The Shen Bao on August 26th: "Imports of perfume and cosmetics in seven months exceeded 1 million yuan." The same day's Xinwen Bao: "Imports of cigarettes in six months approached 20 million yuan." The same source: "Trade deficit with Japan in July reached more than 2.9 million yuan." ... Such shocking news, is this huge amount not "silver exports"? It's just flowing out secretly, unknown to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The United States' raising of silver prices and buying of silver was originally for the sake of preparing for war, while China's silver exports are for profit. However, the biggest key is that the large-scale silver exports reduce the value of foreign goods calculated at gold prices, so a large number of foreign goods are added to the Chinese market out of thin air, and dreamy Chinese people will flock to them. I believe that in the current critical time, it is even more appropriate for everyone to be of one mind and truly "use domestic goods." It must be understood that the invisible export of silver is just buying foreign goods and sending money overseas, which is more harmful than the tangible export of silver.</p>
<p>Everyone understands very well that silver exports are closely related to the rural economy. At a time when provinces across the country are experiencing floods and droughts, there are also large-scale silver exports. Isn't this an extremely contradictory thing? That is why I have explained "tangible" and "intangible." Tangible may still be profitable; intangible, however, is like flowing water, gone forever, without any benefit, and becoming less and less, drier and drier, until it is completely extinct. At that time, it will be truly "helpless."</p>
<p>"Truly using domestic goods" and "persuading friends and relatives to use domestic goods" are the most important and supreme personal matters for Chinese people to address "to others" and "to oneself" now!</p>
<p>Discussion on Domestic Goods</p>
<h3 id="e217">Competition and Squeezing <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>Within the domestic goods industry, we can often hear about mutual competition. This is not bad news, as long as competitors do not intend to squeeze each other out, competition can make products better. In other words, competition will advance the domestic goods industry. However, some large-capital merchants, in order to dominate their industry, disregard profits and losses and squeeze out small-capital businesses, making it impossible for them to stand. This is a crisis for the domestic goods industry.</p>
<p>For example, Factory A makes a bolt of cloth, and Factory B also makes a bolt of cloth. If Factory A and Factory B compete, then Factory A will try to research how to prevent the cloth from fading? Factory B will also find a way to make the cloth less likely to tear? Isn't this very beneficial? Because the best way to improve an object in the world is through competition.</p>
<p>What if there is squeezing? Because Factory A has more capital, it doesn't care about losing money and reduces prices to compete, so others have to lower prices too. Eventually, Factory B has no choice but to close down. What about Factory A? It doesn't care about the quality of the cloth and the reputation of others, so buyers of domestic goods have to buy foreign goods or even completely lose faith in domestic goods. This is very important!</p>
<p>The above has been said in detail. Below, I want to tell the wise buyers:</p>
<p>(1) If there are two items, both of which are domestic goods, you should choose the one with a higher price and better quality. Second, you should write a letter to the store with the inferior product, telling them to improve their product and advising them to work hard to improve.</p>
<p>(2) If you have research on the manufacture of goods, that's even better. You should provide specific improvement methods for the reasons why the product is impractical or of poor quality, and give them to the manufacturer for reference. Or tell them the advantages of foreign manufacturing and tell them to improve.</p>
<p>I think that national factories all want to improve their products, and there will be a valuable competition in an intangible way. Isn't this interesting? However, having the ambition to dominate the market is bound to fail!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1 A Ghost Carries Distant Guests from Guanzhong, a Family With Nothing, and a Ferry Crossing Where People Lament the Qin Dynasty</p>
<p>Cheng Zhiqian thought that they were thanking him for taking them out for a trip, so he also repeatedly said that it was nothing. They were happy at the time, and they dispersed happily. Because Cheng Zhiqian had made an appointment to leave at 7:00 the next day, Zhang and Li got out of bed at 5:00 in the morning. According to their understanding, it was very early at this time. However, after they got out of bed, the people in the inn were already coming and going. Zhang and Li were shocked, fearing that they were late and Mr. Cheng had already left. They hurriedly walked to the outside of Zhiqian's window and looked inside, seeing him sleeping soundly on the bed, then they felt relieved. So the two of them waited quietly in the room. First, they heard Cheng Zhiqian wake up, then they heard him wash his face and drink tea, and then they heard a teahouse waiter leading someone in to report. After a while, he called out: "Mr. Zhang, Mr. Li, are you up yet? We can leave now. Director Wu didn't come, he just sent a car. Our car is going to be much more spacious." Li Shilian heard this and thought, "We've only been here for two days, and now we're going to visit the park and mausoleum? I'm not in the mood for that. To be honest, I'm completely here to meet Director Wu. Since he's not going, I don't want to go either." As he thought this, the words of excuse had not yet been spoken. Zhang Jiefu said: "Great, great, let's go." Shilian thought that since Jiefu had already agreed, he couldn't refuse either. Because Cheng Zhiqian and Director Wu were like brothers, and the chairman had invited him to dinner, it was always best not to offend him. So he reluctantly followed Zhang and Cheng into the car. When they came out of the gate, they found out that the Ministry of Education had sent a permanent secretary to accompany them, sitting in the car and not getting out. After Cheng Zhiqian's introduction, he finally met another person in the officialdom, and he felt a little more comforted. The car drove out of the West Gate and headed west along a very wide and flat road. (13)</p>

<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Shorty Li, from Tianjin, has been a guest in Hangzhou for a long time.</p>
<p>During the "January 28th" battle, he sent his military uniform photo from the Shanghai battlefield. He looked heroic and moving, but because of his short stature, he looked somewhat like a disguised Japanese person.</p>
<p>Attached to the photo was a short note. He said: "Our Chinese men must earn glory for our China!" He also said, "Hangzhou is not a place where our men should stay!" He called me to move to his hometown of Tianjin, or, like him, to join the army and go to the Shanghai battlefield.</p>
<p>Now he has sacrificed for our China, but how can we still remember that there was a Shorty Li who sacrificed for us!</p>
<p>The image of Shorty Li often swirls in my mind. Usually, he always bared his chest and said, "There are many stories in our Tianjin!" Once, he told us the origin of the big scar on his face: At that time, he was still in Tianjin, he beat a notorious Tianjin thug who was working for the Japanese. He was also hit with a stone by that thug, leaving a big hole and a lot of blood flowing from his head, but he didn't groan in pain.</p>
<p>His life history: He had sold art in the north for six years, opened a steamed bun shop in Suzhou, and lived in Hangzhou for three years.</p>
<p>He could also read, keep accounts, and hum a few poems. It is said that he had gone to school when he was young, and he was always proud of this. He often called himself a man of letters!</p>
<p>Alas! Shorty Li is dead! I can't think of any words to describe the longing in my heart, I can only imitate the tone of a lover and say: "Where has my beloved gone! ... Leaving only a photo that makes people cry!"</p>
<p>I often feel ashamed looking at the crooked words in that short note: "We are Chinese men!"</p>

<p>A certain county magistrate inspected the disaster situation in Xiang Township. The township head pawned clothes and slaughtered chickens and ducks to entertain him. During the banquet, the township head pleaded, "County Magistrate, please help us and send relief early, we are really suffering." The county magistrate said drunkenly, "What are you suffering! The people in our county are suffering even more than you. You have chicken and duck to eat in the countryside. I wish I could live in your countryside for the rest of my life."</p>

<p>— Shi Jihong</p>
<p>After a summer vacation of more than two months, Miss So-and-so passed the junior high school graduation exam this year. With nothing on her mind, she can enjoy herself. She got out of bed at nine thirteen in the morning, humming the tune of "Peanuts".</p>
<p>Before washing her face, she must first enjoy the cool breeze, standing on the balcony of the three-story building, it is already so hot in the morning.</p>
<p>Breakfast is placed on the table, usually untouched. She counts twenty-four copper coins and asks the maid to buy a bowl of eel noodles. While eating noodles, she reads the newspaper: supplement, local news, advertisements. Newspaper finished, noodles eaten.</p>
<p>Sitting in the living room is too boring, moving around will lose four ounces of meat. Holding a volume of picture stories for little brothers or sisters, children's picture newspaper, leaning on the rattan armchair, putting her feet up, shaking the banana leaf fan, although it is not as good as Lushan Qingdao, but carefree, happy, without a drop of sweat on her body. Tea comes when she wants it, and if it gets hotter, the electric fan turns on by itself. She sits until half past eleven, then strolls around for a while, and then she can have lunch.</p>
<p>After lunch, chatting and laughing, eating watermelon. Before long, it's already half past two, take a nap, better than swimming in the pool. She really doesn't know how to swim.</p>
<p>Weary eyes, she asks the maid to draw water for a bath, washing and washing every day, washing clean, sprinkling Three Flowers brand talcum powder to enjoy the cool breeze. She eats some snacks. Zhang's older sister sends a letter, "Come play mahjong tomorrow." Reading the evening newspaper, time flies so fast, the sky is dark again. It's good to run around outside, anyway, it's very cool, or hide around the house, muttering, "Why hasn't the report card come yet? The Education Bureau is really a mess." "The books for the second half of the year are really difficult!" "A horse-eye gem set in a ring costs only fifteen yuan."</p>
<p>Someone downstairs calls for dinner.</p>
<p>Stomach full, shaking the fan, enjoying the cool breeze, waiting until nine fifteen, going to bed and sleeping until dawn.</p>

<p>— Ning Yi</p>
<p>When the sky leaks, except for those who have raincoats or automobiles, they always have to rely on this circular umbrella; it is also called a rain umbrella, as the name suggests, it seems to be used only for covering rain and not for other purposes! But there are exceptions. Women who catch dental worms on the street, regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy, are always hand-in-hand with it, forming an inextricable bond? As for farmers walking on the banks of fields, they often rely on it to resist the scorching sun, but people in the city, except when it rains, always disdain it. The umbrella repairer appears on rainy days, perhaps for this reason?</p>
<p>It is said that women's thighs can be bare, but their faces cannot withstand the sun? So when summer arrives, it becomes popular! In the street, it is often next to the ladies, but in fact, it is also because it dresses too beautifully in summer, unlike the usual brown cloth robe, it is not easy to be favored. As for the ladies? It is not entirely for sun protection, half is for decoration, because the newspaper often has the backs of women holding umbrellas [art photos] published, so one is used as a decoration, and the other is used to show off, mutually beneficial, and complement each other.</p>
<p>Because it is cumbersome to carry, men despise it very much, even if it rains, they do not bother to borrow it, but sometimes in order to please his beloved, they will shake hands with it?</p>
<p>Let's talk about this again, men are not absolutely incompatible with it, many of them like "flying umbrellas"! Isn't this clear evidence? A former classmate recently got a "flying umbrella". I said, "Old brother, you don't have to worry about rainy days?" He said, "This is for rain?"</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because all their money was truly too little, even the rice needed for the living was not enough. How could they then prepare the wine and dishes for the dead and the paper ingots for them to use? Thus, every year during the Qingming Festival, though they still went to sweep the graves, they absolutely did not bring wine, dishes, or paper ingots. They would simply dig up a few clumps of earth near the graves, personally carry them, and pile them on top of each grave. Then, from the willow trees by the roadside, they would casually break off a few tender green new willow branches and insert them in the center of the clumps of earth. 丨丨Because willow trees are the first to grow leaves each spring, people inevitably view them with favor.丨丨 As a kind of adornment. This kind of adornment was certainly not for passersby to admire; their intention was to let their ancestors know that although they were very poor, even unable to afford paper ingots, they still constantly remembered their ancestors in their hearts! In this way, although the ancestors did not have delicious wine and dishes to eat, nor paper money to use, they finally received a kind of comfort in their spirits. For the descendants to be able to make their ancestors' spirits in heaven comforted was, after all, a kind of "unceasing filial piety"! The last kind of people could not even prepare soil and new willows. The inability to prepare them, as mentioned here, certainly does not mean that they could not afford to buy soil or new willows, because these two things originally did not need money to buy. But perhaps their ancestral graves were too far from their homes. Either due to a lack of travel expenses or being too busy working to make a living, they could not go. There was no way but to let their ancestors suffer some grievance! Now, it is this desolate and lonely phenomenon displayed by this pile of communal graves that no one ever comes to sweep that has touched the Empress Dowager's heart, causing her to suddenly feel an indescribable sorrow during her extremely exciting journey.

<p>Small Records of Local Customs</p>
<h3 id="e227">A Few Small Impressions of Traveling North <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Although this time I only went as far as Tai'an, I have already stepped into the territory of the Northern Country. The customs of the Northern Country are naturally different from those of the Southern Country. There are a few small impressions that I will never forget.</p>
<p>Spring Couplets 丨 Whether in the city or outside the city, there is not a single household that does not paste a pair of spring couplets on its lintel. Added to this are four-character plaques. The sentences of the spring couplets are mostly auspicious words with a praising meaning, probably all ready-made sentences. However, the formerly commonly used "Imperial grace is as vast as spring, the literary governance shines like the sun" is now gone. In Qufu, there are often matters related to Confucius, indicating that they live in the land of the sage, and every family is nurtured by Confucianism, forming a seed of Confucian scholars. It is rare to see good calligraphy. This kind of non-popular art has become popular. There, the walls are all made of mud, with at most a few feet of bricks laid at the base. The architecture is so simple, yet they are unwilling to omit the spring couplets. Spring couplets, like the rouge of Southern Country girls, have become an indispensable decoration.</p>
<p>Rickshaws 丨 This is a sharp tool for cultural exchange. If there are rickshaws in this place, then new material civilization will gradually be transported over. Rickshaws originated in Japan, and Shanghai was the earliest to accept them. However, now, the rickshaws in Shanghai are far inferior to those in the Northern Country. They all have black bodies, so they really shouldn't be called "yellow package cars." Loudspeakers emit grand sounds, and white cloth awnings are installed above, providing shade for the pullers. The handles are inlaid with brass, some of which are polished brightly. The lights are also very grandly placed on the left and right, almost like the private cars in Shanghai. Unlike the yellow package cars in Suzhou, which are small and broken, when the awning is raised on a rainy day, your head will hit the top and your knees will hit the front, guaranteeing that you'll be as wet as a drowned chicken.</p>
<p>Flies 丨 In the Southern Country, people with even a little bit of hygiene knowledge hate flies like anything, but in the Northern Country, they are commonplace. Those items placed on open-air stalls are completely covered with flies, and no one drives them away. In these few days, watermelon rinds, peach and pear skins are all things that attract flies, so there is a constant buzzing sound everywhere. When we saw it, we didn't dare to buy anything. The vendors at the station are relatively more aware, and they know to cover the fruit with a very dense net, and the chicken cages have lids.</p>
<p>Toilets 丨 The toilets in the Northern Country are the dirtiest. The same goes for hotels. Only the "guesthouses" at a few major stations along the railway have flush toilets. If you want to solve the problem of excretion, you must first be proficient in the skill of climbing into the pit. Northern Country friends simply don't know how to use toilets, so the Yanzhou Railway Guesthouse has a flush toilet, which is considered a new invention adapted to local conditions.</p>
<p>Cloth 丨 It is rare to see people wearing silk clothes in the Northern Country. Most people use cloth. Even young girls wear cloth clothes, because they have not yet been contaminated by the Shanghai style. They do not have the courage to use gorgeous colors and fragrant scents to lure the opposite sex and make them pursue them. Therefore, I saw several female students, some wearing moon-white bamboo cloth, some wearing purple-background black-flower cloth, which is still the 19th century in the Southern Country. Men work even harder to use cloth, and it is rare to use silk for shoes. Moreover, the two primary colors of blue and white are the most commonly seen, which is the spirit of the Northern Country.</p>
<p>Once you cross the Yangtze River, everything changes. Could it be that the drought and the production of Southern Country friends are stronger than those of the Northern Country? I don't believe it!</p>

<h3 id="e228">Financial Speculation Initiates Gold Price Rebound of $2.90 <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>▲ British Silver Recedes, Bullish ▲</p>
<p>The gold market was strong again yesterday. Major speculators covered their short positions, and market sentiment was excellent. The price once rose above the $50 mark. The market situation was still mediocre for half the day, and fluctuations were small. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets saw British silver recede and American silver remain flat. London raw gold fell by eight and a half pence. Although exchange rates rose, they were not affected. American cotton fell by seventeen pounds, and American wheat saw mixed ups and downs. Market sentiment was firm due to the major bank's clearing of silver accounts at the close of the previous day, the satisfaction of buyers, and the rumor that the United States had not purchased gold. The price of goods opened and immediately rose to $48. Trading preparations by gold merchants also showed a flat trend, but because the exchange market was ordinary and banks were still offering gold, the price briefly fell after the opening. However, market sentiment was very stable. Knowing that HSBC's listed exchange rates for British and American silver had each decreased by 0.125, and that the Central Bank also opened for cash transactions, the price rose after falling, but banks were still supplying gold. At this time, sellers were still eager, and the situation was not yet very bullish. However, under the relentless covering by Sen Changyong, the price was maintained with great effort. Chinese merchants also formed a union, and the exchange market gradually showed tightness, resulting in a situation of demand exceeding supply in the market. Major speculators such as Sen Changyong, Dadecheng, and Fuyu frantically purchased gold, and the gold price gradually rose and became firmer. Although there was a slow phase in the middle, the first-order prices had already tightened to the 5-pence mark, the buying interest was enthusiastic, and market sentiment was prosperous, so the price broke through the $50 mark. However, Yifeng, Yongfuxingyong, and Huixiang took advantage of the high price to sell off, and the midday close still succumbed to below the $50 mark. During the half day, there was a lack of important news, and the trend remained stable and mediocre. The Central Bank opened for spot transactions of more than 300 gold bars, about half a yuan higher than the futures price. The nine-ten month swap was flat. The situation of the half-day market is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $948, up $1.10 from the previous close. The price of goods opened at $8.10. The exchange market's morning opening prices for near-term sales were British exchange at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.03125, and American exchange at $35.625. Sen Changyong immediately entered the market and rose to $8.40. Hua Bi offered November American dollars at $0.6875 and December shillings at $0.125. Dafayong, Honglishun, Maohengyu, and Zhengchang all sold and retreated to $0.67. Although the price stabilized after entering the market, it hovered due to the banks still offering November American dollars at $0.6875. Knowing that HSBC's listed prices for British and American silver had each decreased by 0.125, Yuqing, Yongqing, Yuyingfeng, Hengshenkang, Dadecheng, Tongchun, Fuxingyong, and others advanced orders. There was news that the Central Bank had opened for cash transactions, and the price rose to $8.40. Hengyu, Fu'an, Fuchang, and Yongfeng sold off, and the price dropped to $0.77. Sen Changyong vigorously advanced orders and still announced firmness, but there was much struggle. Tianfeng also came to sell fiercely. However, Sen Changyong and Dadecheng's buying intentions were very strong, and the price rose to above $8. Hengyu, Fuyu, and Daxingyong vigorously purchased, and the price rose to $9.40. Hua Bi and Youli sold November British gold at $0.0625. Although Daxingyong and Zhaofengchang advanced, Hengyu, Yicheng, Dingkang, Fuchang, and Dadecheng fought to sell off, and the price dropped to $8.60. However, market sentiment was firm, and Dafayong, Fuyu, and Dadecheng vigorously advanced orders, and the price broke through the $50 mark, rising to $0.03. Yifengyong and Yuqingyong vigorously sold off, retreating to $49.50. Buying interest did not diminish, and market sentiment was upward. Hengtai, Yuanchangyong, Dadecheng, Bingxing, and others still had a buying appetite, especially Dadecheng's purchase was the most eager, and the price rose to $50.04. In the end, Yifengyong, Fuchangzhengchang, Fuxingyong, Huixiang, and others had strong selling intentions, and the midday close still retreated to $949.80. The price of goods was auctioned at $9.20. After the close, Huixiang and the goods market both sold off, retreating to within $9. The highest price during the half day was $950.04, and the lowest price was $946.07, a fluctuation of $3.07. As a result, it rose $2.90 from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on HSBC's listed American dollar exchange rate decreasing by 0.125 to $35.25, equivalent to a gold price of $981.56. In terms of the closing price, it was approximately $32 weaker, slightly more suppressed than the previous close. The bookkeeping price for this month was $951, and for October it was $950. The interest supplement in the morning was $951. The price of pure gold was calculated by adding $11, totaling $959. There was a lack of large inflows and outflows in the market. The Tianjin group was watching. The buying price for 99.3% fineness was generally calculated by adding $13, and the selling price was $14.50. Futures trading had become sluggish, and secondary goods saw slight transactions, calculated by adding about $12. The Central Bank opened for cash transactions of 210 gold bars, which were sold by Shenkang and Yingfengheng, at a price of $948. After entering the market, Yingfengheng then sold another 105 gold bars, slightly higher than the gold price. The nine-ten month swap was closed flat by Yingfengheng to Huiyuan for 84 gold bars. 861 gold bars remained in the current month, with a total of nine long positions and three short positions.</p>
<p>In the market, demand exceeded supply, and transactions were still flat. In total, Sen Changyong, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Tongchun, Yuanchangyong, Shenkang, Bingxing, Hongkang, Yongyuanxing, Daxingyong, Zhaojichang, and others were on the buying side. Zhengchang, Yifengyong, Dingkang, Fuchang, Shunmao, Fu'an, Yuanmao, Yonghuixiang, Yongdeyongfeng, Hengyu, Fuxingyong, and others were on the selling side. Dafayong and Yicheng Dingtai Yingfengheng went long first and then short. Yifengyong and Tianfeng Yuqingyong went short first and then long. The Dalian gang Wanxing did not trade a total of 1,000 gold bars and did not net much. Shunli traded a total of more than 400 gold bars and netted a little. The Guangdong gang Shenglida was calm, as was Hengxing. The total number of transactions on the day was 31,367 gold bars.</p>
<p>The October futures lineup: buyers included Wanxing with more than 4,700 gold bars, Yifengyong with more than 4,500 gold bars, Dadecheng with more than 3,900, Shunli with more than 3,000, Fuchangyongli with more than 1,900 each, Yuanhengding each with more than 1,200, Runchangyu and Daxingyong each with more than 1,100, Tongfenghun and Shunmao each with more than 800, Fuxingyong Hengxing Qiafengyong each with more than 700, Dachangxiang and Dashun each with more than 600, Changshengyong and Runchangyong each with more than 500, Shenyuqing and Fayongyuanshengyong Hongkangyong each with more than 400, Hongxingyong Bingxingshengda each with more than 300.

<h3 id="e229">Chinese Merchants Continue to Pursue Foreign Exchange, Slightly Tightening <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegrams, the London major silver decreased by 0.0625 in both near and far terms. Short-term buyers were satisfied. London raw gold fell by eight and a half pence. The British pound rose by one cent against the US dollar. The US dollar rose by two-thirds of a penny against the British pound. The British pound rose by twenty-two pounds against the French franc. The US dollar rose by 0.125 against the French franc. The exchange market's morning opening prices for near-term sales were British exchange at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.031215, and American exchange at $35.625, up 0.03125 for the British pound and flat for the American dollar compared to the previous close. The situation was stable after the opening. Although banks had a selling appetite, buyers were still eager. HSBC's listed prices were announced, with both British and American exchange rates decreasing by 0.125. After this, although the domestic market was flat, the underlying trend was tight due to the Chinese merchants' pursuit. After hovering, the Chinese merchants scrambled for shillings, stimulating the exchange market. The trend was bullish thereafter, but there were still no special changes, and the difference was minimal. The midday close prices for near-term sales were British exchange at 1 shilling 5 pence, and American exchange at $35.5625, both up 0.0625 compared to the previous close. The British exchange rate was tighter than the American dollar during the half-day process. Chinese merchants also worked hard to scramble for shillings. Banks such as HSBC, Hua Bi, and Jincheng offered silver, while Zhejiang slightly accepted it. Sassoon slightly offered it. Hua Bi, Shanghai, Overseas Chinese, Datong, and Maijiali supplied American exchange. The Chinese merchants scrambled for more than 100,000 pounds of shillings and 400,000 to 500,000 yuan of American exchange. The half-day transaction records are as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening price for near-term sales of British exchange was 1 shilling 5 pence 0.03125. Hua Bi offered December at 0.125.

<h3 id="e230">Silver Dollar Transactions are Tighter <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's price for silver dollar loans in the market was slightly softer than in the past few days, but the current situation and development indicate that it will definitely become firmer in the future. Therefore, the phenomenon does have a prosperous outlook. The interest rate for silver dollar loans was 1.2 cents for both the morning and afternoon markets, down 0.2 cents from the previous day. The phenomenon of "covering the head with water," i.e., using the principal to inflate the loan, was prevalent, and there was always blank credit. However, transactions were generally moderately busy. Loan transactions transferred over 3.9 million in the morning market and over 400,000 in new transactions. There were 600,000 in the afternoon market, and over 200,000 in small trade association transactions. Silver dollar collateral transactions saw more redemptions and fewer new loans, with 1.2 million in redemptions and 800,000 in new loans. The amount of banknotes collected and issued totaled 2.67 million, with 200,000 from customers and 400,000 going to stomachs. Bank collections and remittances were slightly busier than the comparable period yesterday, with foreign banks collecting and remitting notes and remittances totaling 334,000, telegraphic transfers of over 500,000, and various goods, exchange, collateral, and miscellaneous collections and remittances of 4.34 million, foreign exchange settlement of over 900,000, and 600,000 out of storage. Chinese banks collected and remitted notes totaling over 4.1 million, various goods, exchange, tax collateral, and miscellaneous collections and remittances of 6.3 million, foreign exchange settlement of over 1.2 million, telegraphic transfers of 800,000 to 900,000, and 800,000 out of storage. Japanese banks collected and remitted notes totaling 2.89 million, various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous collections and remittances of 4.89 million, foreign exchange settlement of over 1.4 million, and 400,000 into storage. The amount of foreign exchange remitted by money shops and public merchants was higher yesterday due to the comparable period, totaling over 51 million, foreign exchange remitted on "blank heads" totaling over 7.8 million, exchange remitted from various sources totaling over 800,000, and cash collection of over 1 million. The total amount exchanged on the 5th at the Clearing House was 10,005,958.74 silver dollars, including 5,732,574.42 silver dollars in silver coins and 4,323,384.32 silver dollars in exchange drafts.</p>

<p>▲ Guangdong Copper Reaches Its Peak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the copper coin market saw a sharp contraction in prices due to small traders extorting and hoarding. The price had already fallen by 3,000 cash the day before, and yesterday it plunged by another 7,000 cash, a huge drop of 10,000 cash in two days, which was rare. There were 38,160 strings of cash in transactions. Small Jiangnan silver dollars remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon markets at 833 yuan, down 3 yuan from the previous day. There were 4,000 jiao in transactions in the morning market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were at 754 yuan in the morning market, up 2 yuan from the previous day, and down 2 yuan again in the afternoon market, at 752 yuan, the same result as the previous afternoon. Because the market price rose, Suzhou had a source of supply, totaling more than 100,000 jiao, so the market price fell. There were 120,000 jiao in transactions in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market.</p>

<p>First Two Rounds of Eager Short Covering: Sharp Rise</p>
<p>Third Round of Floating Longs Emerging: Sudden Drop</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a surge in short covering, with strong buying interest from all groups, especially the northern group. Because the price for silver dollar loans was slightly down at 0.2 cents, the trend gradually became looser. The Russo-Japanese situation had shown significant easing, and international silver prices were gradually becoming more balanced. The environment was stable, and the short sellers were shaken. However, a large rise followed by a small retreat was inevitable. The sharp drop in the late session was probably due to mistakenly believing rumors in the evening newspaper. It is expected that the price of silver dollar loans will continue to trend downward in the future, and market prices should still fluctuate upwards. Yesterday's process saw strong buying interest from all groups at the opening, with the northern group being the strongest. Only No. 4 had some selling, and the table was extremely tight, with a sharp rise of several jiao to $1.75. In the second round, there were some temporary long liquidations in the middle, slightly weakening by one or two jiao, but the rest continued to be good by three to five jiao. At the close, some floating longs emerged, gradually weakening. A large rise followed by a small retreat was reasonable. After the close, the price unexpectedly fell by about one yuan because the evening newspaper reported that the Fuzhou-Shanghai telegraph line had occasional obstructions, and people generally misinterpreted the news and sold heavily. As a result, the market price only saw the September futures for the 22nd customs slip by 0.15 yuan, while the rest rose from 0.2-0.3 yuan to 1.2-1.3 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated at around 35 million yuan. The details of the rises and falls are listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>▲U.S. Treasury Department to Announce New Fiscal Plan</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company Stock Market Report: Yesterday (4th), the New York stock market was very sluggish as traders awaited the results of the textile strike and there was insufficient news to provide any excitement. As a result, it showed a slight downward trend. The stocks on the small exchange all trended downward. The bond market was mixed but lower, and the decline in government securities was particularly significant. This was because the dollar was loosening and the Treasury Department was about to announce its new fiscal plan. Generally, there was a large-scale sell-off, resulting in a drop of almost one point, reaching the lowest price of the year. Chicago wheat rebounded due to reports of a visible decrease in supply. The total daily trading volume was 310,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York index is as follows:</p>
<p>Date | 3rd | 4th | Change</p>

<p>丨Foreign Merchants Sell Off Immediately When Prices Rise丨</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning but was sluggish in the afternoon. Market sentiment remained soft, but current yarn sales to customers were still not bad, and market sentiment was difficult to stimulate, as there were fewer new buyers. As for the foreign merchants, they sold off in large quantities as soon as prices rose, so the market hovered.</p>

<p>The pre-market opening of cotton yarn futures showed a lack of new sellers in the market, but buying interest was sufficient to offset this. The prevailing sentiment was that prices had already fallen by more than ten yuan from their peak and were unlikely to fall much further in the short term. As a result, there was no intense selling pressure, and some participants had already taken long positions. At the same time, news regarding spot yarn was positive, with far-month contracts rising by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 yuan. However, the current month's contract remained unchanged. In the afternoon, foreign firms began selling, loosening up the market, and contracts for all months fell by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 18,400 bales. Sales included 1,150 bales by Dafeng, 450 bales by Tongji, 450 bales by Renfeng, 650 bales by Gengfeng, 450 bales by Yuanyi, 650 bales by Hengchang, and 850 bales by Xiesheng. Purchases included 1,050 bales by Jinchang, 800 bales by Changyu, 800 bales by Changfeng, 700 bales by Xiesheng, 550 bales by Huikang, 500 bales by Shenji, and 400 bales by Xiesheng.

<p>Spot yarn sales remained good. Total purchases by various guilds for the day were 1,028 bales, with prices similar to the previous day. The breakdown of purchases by guild is as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha   80      Haizhou   35      Local   95      Northern  10</p>

<p>The cotton market trended upward, as arrivals from various regions were not abundant and Xin Xin factories frequently purchased new spot cotton. Consequently, buyers' sentiment was strong, with no selling pressure. Although foreign cotton prices fell, the local market price was not significantly affected. However, with lackluster yarn market performance, the cotton market is unlikely to rise independently. With increasing future supply, market prices are likely to decline.</p>

<p>The cotton futures market opened higher, with strong buying sentiment. New cotton arrivals from various regions were not abundant, and Dafu (a company) short positions were still being covered. As a result, market sentiment was relatively tight, and contracts for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The afternoon opening was flat, and the market turned quiet after the first two or three rounds of trading. Prices suddenly rebounded, and contracts for all months rose by another 0.05 yuan. However, foreign firms continued to sell without change. The total trading volume for the day was 55,800 dan. Sales included 1,300 dan by Ruidai, 1,000 dan by Senkang, 1,600 dan by Tongfeng, 3,000 dan by Shenji, 2,000 dan by Runkang, 2,100 dan by Yuanxingchang, and 2,000 dan by Changhe, 1,400 dan by Ruiyuan.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton prices fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, southern hedging sales, and a sluggish cloth market. As a result, spot prices fell by 20 points, and futures prices fell by 12 to 17 points. British cotton futures remained unchanged. Indian cotton speculators made slight purchases, resulting in a fall of one rupee for Pingguoer, 1.5 rupees for Aomula, and 0.5 rupees for Bairoxi.

<p>According to a report from the Textile Division of the U.S. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, U.S. cotton exports in May totaled 285,000 bales, valued at $17,298,000. In May of last year, exports totaled 592,000 bales, valued at $25,787,000. U.S. cotton exports in May this year decreased by 102,000 bales, or 26%, compared to April of the same year. Over the past ten months, from August of last year to May of this year, U.S. cotton exports totaled 6,769,000 bales, valued at $370,307,600. This represents a decrease of 344,000 bales, or 5%, compared to the same period in the previous cotton season, but an increase in value of $95,831,000, or 35%.</p>

<p>Results Present a Mixed Picture</p>
<p>The flour market fluctuated significantly. After the morning opening, all months followed the previous day's sharp decline, and dealers across the board sold back their holdings. The market was even more sluggish around noon, with near-month contracts down by about 0.04 yuan and far-month contracts down by more than 0.03 yuan. Market sentiment remained weak, as factories sought to hedge their positions due to sluggish actual sales. Dealers, aware of the weak factory demand and slow customer sales, also rushed to sell. This renewed downward pressure occurred due to both factories and dealers competing to sell. However, after the price decline, factories stopped selling. Speculators took advantage of the low prices to cover their short positions, attracting new long positions from both inside and outside the industry. Prices gradually rose, recovering by 0.04, 0.05, or 0.06 yuan. The spot market sales remained weak, down by a little over 0.01 yuan. July contracts are down 0.01 yuan each, November is up by a significant 0.05 yuan, and December and February are each up by 0.015 yuan.</p>
<p>The wheat market fluctuated. After the morning opening, foreign wheat rose slightly, and factory demand for spot wheat revived, triggering short covering. Contracts for all months rose across the board, especially near-month contracts due to short covering, with prices rising significantly by 0.04, 0.05, or 0.06 yuan. However, after the price increase, the flour market declined, and sentiment weakened again. Traders, seeing the futures prices rise, thought it more favorable to sell futures and buy spot. Selling pressure increased, and prices fell again in the afternoon, declining by 0.05, 0.06, or 0.07 yuan. At the close, the current month was still up by a significant 0.01 yuan, October and November were down by 0.01 yuan each, December was down by 0.02 yuan, January was down by 0.03 yuan, and February was down significantly by 0.06 yuan. After factories lowered prices, spot wheat opened yesterday at 35,000 bags. High-quality wheat from Shandong and other regions was discounted by 2.6 yuan, down 0.15 yuan from the previous week.</p>

<p>(Shanghai Market) Yesterday, the supply from various guilds was still scarce, only about ten batches (totaling 1,400 to 1,500 shi). Sales were also slow, but sentiment was relatively stable, creating a tight situation. In the end, due to the unfavorable environment, there was no significant improvement. Prices for various grades of thick japonica rice and late-season rice remained unchanged. Only new japonica rice and "Shejian" rice were slightly more popular due to limited arrivals, while Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan rice remained stagnant. Factory owners also continued to offer 11 yuan.</p>
<p>(Northern Shanghai) Yesterday, about ten batches of rice arrived from various locations in Hexia. Various types of rice on the market, including white japonica, thin rice, Dongxin japonica rice, and Chen Yangjian rice, showed a slight increase in activity, and prices were slightly firmer. White Yuan, Xin Yangjian, and Kesjian rice remained sluggish, with prices down by 0.02 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the spot market for foreign customer indica rice was quite mixed. Due to ample inventory , the price has dropped and the merchants are trying to sell off their holding. The spot price of Grade 1 Saigon rice was very high in mid-last month, reaching 12.2 or 12.3 yuan. This was for 2,700 bags sold yesterday afternoon, with the price being only 11.2 yuan. When this batch arrived at the beginning of last month, importers had quoted 12.2 yuan, but the merchants were optimistic and did not sell. Now, the price has suddenly dropped by one yuan, and merchants and dealers are eager to sell. The price may need to be lowered further in the next day or two. Annan japonica rice is down slightly by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. However, the inventory of small-grained rice is low, and the supply is dwindling, so the market is relatively stable. Foreign Yuan rice is also scarce, so it can also hold steady. Due to various parties selling futures of foreign rice, the price is gradually declining. The total trading volume for the city was 500 tons for futures and 4,500 bags for spot. Customer indica rice has arrived slightly recently. While the domestic market continues to inquire, the Jiangxi guild has a strong appetite, and the market has shown signs of improvement. Yesterday, Gao Xiang rice saw a price increase of 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. The total sales of various indica rice in the city were 9,000 bags, most of which were purchased by the Jiujiang guild. Coarse rice and Zhangzhou rice were mostly inquired about by the domestic market, but they were not as popular as Xiangji factory rice. However, current digestion of various types of rice is active, and the Jiangxi guild still has a strong appetite, so market sentiment is still hopeful.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Sugar Market <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Raw Sugar and White Sugar Show Slight Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was sluggish due to low trading volume. The guild set the price for Grade 24 raw sugar and ordinary spot white sugar at 19.75 yuan, down 0.05 yuan from the previous day. The price for goods held by local merchants was 19.85 yuan, and the price for transit goods was 6.5 yuan. The price for ordinary Dutch red sugar was 14.6 yuan, and the price for transit goods was 5.5 yuan. The price for Taikoo Sugar B Mark was 20 yuan. The local price of Chaoqing (sugar) has been stable recently, but the supply is still insufficient. Local quotations are also flat. Due to low market activity, merchants' interest in purchasing is weak, so there is a lack of transactions between buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>New Yan Peach Meat Suffers Poor Harvest Due to Floods</p>
<p>The New Yan peach meat crop has already started. According to reports, the harvest has been greatly reduced due to recent floods, with only about 40% of the normal yield. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Hankou now, but it has been delayed by the floods and will be shipped out by the end of the week. The initial prices will be high.</p>

<p>More Than 2,000 Boxes of American Tinplate Ordered</p>
<p>Recently, the tinplate market in this city, regardless of American, German, Italian, or French goods, has seen transactions from both factories and customers and is no longer as sluggish as before. However, people have been hesitant to place orders due to high prices (3 to 6 or 7 yuan higher than the selling price in this city). Current market prices for American 90-pound tinplate are 16.5 yuan (single sheet) and 32.5 yuan (double sheet). 100-pound single sheet is 17 yuan, and double sheet is 35 yuan. German single sheet is out of stock, and 90-pound double sheet is 31.5 yuan, and 100-pound is 32.75 yuan. The prices for Italian and French goods are similar to German goods. Daily quotations have been quite high. However, an overseas transaction of American goods was reportedly made yesterday for more than 2,700 boxes, with prices of 9 gold yuan per box for 90-pound double sheets (without iron shell) and 9.25 gold yuan (with iron shell). 100-pound double sheets are 9.25 gold yuan per box (without iron shell) and 9.47 gold yuan (with iron shell). No transactions for single sheets have been reported.</p>

<p>Small Basket Soybean Oil Drops Slightly by One Yuan</p>
<p>The soybean oil market has been quiet for a long time. Due to sluggish sales and low production prices, market sentiment is weak. Buyers and sellers have been holding out for more than a week. Yesterday, only small basket oil was traded, with the "Shahe" steamer shipping out hundreds of pieces "including in stock". The price was 10.05 yuan, down by one yuan compared to the previous price. It is said that the market may not fall much further. Large basket oil remains stagnant. Overall, due to droughts in inland waterways, sales are sluggish, and the market is unlikely to develop in the short term.</p>

<p>The New York Raw Silk Exchange has only auctioned Japanese silk in the past. After repeated consultations by our government's consul general in New York, the American Silk Merchants Association decided that raw silk produced in all countries of the world that are exported to the United States in large quantities can be auctioned. Chinese silk was auctioned for the first time on the 4th of this month, with factory silk of 20-22 denier and 83 points of uniformity as the auction standard. This is good news amidst the declining sales of Chinese silk in the United States. However, the labor unrest in the American textile industry is becoming more serious, making it difficult for silk sales to recover. Silk factories in Lyon and other places are also experiencing weak demand for raw silk due to sluggish silk fabric sales. Silk telegrams have not shown any signs of improvement, and market sentiment remains sluggish. Only silk merchants continue to purchase 20 packages of white factory silk and 5 packages of printed silk, and the price remains firm.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Shexian Fine Eyebrow (Tea) Plummets <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>After Yingzhuang Jinlong Yanghang opened Shexian Fine Eyebrow green tea, Yihe, Xiehe, Tianyu, and other firms started to actively procure it yesterday. The market inventory of two or three thousand boxes has been almost completely sold out. However, the selling price was 65 yuan, a sharp drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous week, and a drop of 30 to 40 yuan compared to the opening price. Chinese tea merchants suffered significant losses. Ordinary wholesale goods of fine eyebrow tea from Tunxi, Wuyuan, and other regions are still selling slowly. However, Baochang, Yihe, and other firms are making sporadic purchases of core-extracted tea, but market prices are also trending downward.</p>

<h3 id="e251">"Minority" and "Special" <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Li</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Linsheng has written a book called "Parallel Prose," published by the Commercial Press. He also published an article titled "The Study Method of Parallel Prose" in the Commercial Press's "Publication Weekly." According to him, even in "this era of advocating literary reform," parallel prose, that "piled-up aristocratic literature," is still worth "studying" and learning to do. His reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>"Literature appreciated by a (minority) of people is called aristocratic literature by scholars. Assuming that this term is absolutely correct and unchangeable, then we must recognize two points: (1) Something supported by a (minority) of people is not necessarily bad. This has been the subject of heated discussion in political science. Expressing the opinions of minorities (minority representation) is a strategy in politics, so let's not go into detail. When it comes to literature, isn't it the same? Compared with poetry, there are always fewer people who appreciate Parallel Prose. (2) What is appreciated by a minority often becomes what is appreciated by a majority. Parallel prose may not have this trend, but the branches and remnants of Parallel Prose, such as congratulatory couplets, elegiac couplets, and hanging couplets, can indeed give people a lot to appreciate."</p>
<p>Another reason is that "Parallel Prose is a (special) product of our country" and is enough to "hold its head high" against Western literature.</p>
<p>Saying that things of "minority" people are good and that "special" things are valuable are not reasons that Mr. Liu found temporarily to defend Parallel Prose, but are fundamentally based on their ideology. I will use Mr. Liu's views on Parallel Prose to prove this point.</p>
<p>In Mr. Liu's "Parallel Prose Literature," he introduces many Parallel Prose writers, and the part about the Qing Dynasty is also published in "Publication Weekly." After the biography of each writer, he extracts the writer's aphorisms and includes comments, in the following format.</p>
<p>"Mao Qiling, style name Dake, from Xiaoshan. Scholars call him Mr. Xihe. A student of the Ming Dynasty. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, he shaved his head and lived in the mountains, studying in an earthen room. During the Kangxi period, he was summoned for the Hongbo examination, awarded the position of reviewer, and compiled the History of the Ming Dynasty. Later, he asked to return home due to illness. He died at the age of ninety-four. His collected works on classics and literature total two hundred and thirty-four volumes.</p>
<p>Aphorisms: Since ancient times, when Jianwu achieved governance, he favored treacherous soldiers; when Zhenguan achieved peace, he indulged rebellious commands. (Ode to Ping滇) When the Zhu Banner wipes away tears, it all becomes rouge; when the plain axe loses its heart, do not govern the country. (Epitaph of Shen Yunying)</p>
<p>Xihe was a classicist who wrote literature, which was profound and did not fall into the fashion of the time. The epitaph of Shen Yunying is the most representative. Qian Jibo said that his writing was both regular and free, and not thorny."</p>
<p>Parallel Prose itself and the Parallel Prose of the Qing Dynasty have their own value. Looking at them as antiques has a different meaning, but if you want to see them, you must see the whole article. It is meaningless to extract one or two aphorisms to appreciate. (I have an article on "Aphorisms" discussing this in detail, so I won't talk about the principles here.) For example, Mao Xihe's aphorisms quoted above are indeed excellent in the original text, but they must be connected to the whole text to make sense. Now, if we look at them in isolation, what good can we see? Let's look at other aphorisms, and it's the same, such as Chen Qinian's "If a noble carriage enters Wei, fortunately mention Zhu Hai in the city; as for the purple ribbons touring Wu, I wish to describe Bo Luan in the hall." Yuan Zicai's "Like the sun watering frost and snow, everything it passes disappears; like a long drought getting clouds and rain, I'm afraid it will be too late to return."</p>
<p>However, why do some people only read aphorisms when they read articles? This is because of their ideology, because their ideology is individualistic, so their scope is narrow. In their minds, everything in the universe has no connection, but is a series of isolated things. Among the isolated phenomena, they find a phenomenon that is beneficial to themselves and worship it, regarding it as the representative and ruler of all phenomena. Therefore, in the eyes of these people, there is no whole universe, only a sun suspended in the sky; there is no whole nation-state, only emperors and generals; there is no history of connection and evolution, only (special) signs of prosperity and decline; and even when looking at flowers, they only look at a branch inserted in a vase, and when reading articles, they only look at a few sentences circled on the side...</p>
<p>All such people must value the (special), and will not recognize the essence of the universe or the structure of society at all. They will never understand the spirit of the masses.</p>

<p>(II)</p>
<p>"It's really unlucky. I'm starving, but I'm still so cheerfully poor. That bookworm!"</p>
<p>As soon as Zilu said "bookworm," he quickly covered his mouth with his hand, fearing that Zhongni would hear him.</p>
<p>"Zhong You, what are you saying?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. I said: Scholars serve the ruler and follow the Way, and get promoted and rich. Other people are so happy, but you, old Master, are unlucky all your life!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Those who truly have knowledge have no reason not to be poor!"</p>
<p>"Then there must be some shortcomings in their knowledge! Or we say "benevolence" and "love," but other people don't believe us. Or we are waiting for opportunities, but we have not seized them!"</p>
<p>"That's nonsense! Didn't Boyi and Shuqi starve to death? Why didn't Prince Bigan speculate well and wait for people to cut open his stomach? Alas! "Not a rhinoceros, not a tiger, wandering in the wilderness!" Why are we so unlucky!"</p>
<p>Zilu silently retreated, and Zigong walked in.</p>
<p>"Ci! You say: "Not a rhinoceros, not a tiger, wandering in the wilderness!" Why are we so unlucky?"</p>
<p>"Master must also compromise a bit! This society, this group of people, will always fail if they don't compromise."</p>
<p>"How can I compromise? "Am I a bitter gourd? How can I be tied up and not eat?" In the State of Lu, in the State of Chu, as long as there is an opportunity, I always seriously want to do something for them, but they always kick me away and let me roll around. Last time, even when Gongshan Buniu greeted me, I wanted to try it. Compromise, compromise, there is always a limit. How can you ask me to compromise?"</p>
<p>Zigong thought for a while and felt that he had nothing to say, so he retreated. Yan Yuan finally went in, and Zhongni said to him very warmly:</p>
<p>"Hui, you say: "Not a rhinoceros, not a tiger, wandering in the wilderness!" Why are we so unlucky?"</p>
<p>"Master, you don't have to think about these things. We have treasures, but they don't know the value of them, which shows that they are big fools. Why do we have to think about whether we are unlucky or not!"</p>
<p>Zhongni was so happy when he heard this that he jumped up and said:</p>
<p>"Okay, Hui! You be the boss, and I'll be the partner!"</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>"Phoenix, phoenix, what virtue has declined! The past cannot be advised, but the future can still be pursued?</p>
<p>Enough, enough, those who are in politics today are in danger!"</p>
<p>This long and mournful Chu song pierced Zhongni's heart! (End)</p>

<p>— Di Zhou</p>
<p>Walking on R Road plunged me into memories. I carefully gazed at a Western-style house by the roadside, its walls still red, but somewhat dim. It used to be a rectangular building behind the girls' dormitory and library, quiet and deserted. Right there, the stove was burning inside, the small space filled with people reading, each with passion burning faintly in their mind; each with expectations shimmering indistinctly in their heart. Naturally, each was their own person, but they also had things in common.</p>
<p>Walking a few more steps slowly, the left side of the building, with many windows, faced me. The windows are now tightly closed. Open them and let the sunlight into the classroom! Yes, it was late winter and early spring then, the icy cold air assaulting us even in the daytime. We opened all the windows, letting the cold air and sunlight in. We concentrated on moving our pencils, recording the lecturer's notes in our notebooks. What admiring, joyful, and determined gazes shone from my eyes! At night, the lights were bright, like a grand banquet in full swing, hearts pounding, faces flushed, ascending the podium, "Students, where is the driving force of social evolution? Tonight we will answer this question..." The resounding voice tensed the air. The night lost its silence, resembling the ebb and flow of the tide, covered by the 'sizzling' sound of the rushing wind. Late at night, everyone was still excited, patting each other on the shoulders, striding out of the school gate...</p>
<p>A little further away, the lawn lay in the sunlight, unchanged, except that the grass then seemed greener, and people holding books scattered around, walking or standing still. In the early morning and at dusk, many people would gather around, like in a club, laughing loudly and talking loudly. Or two or three would walk and talk. I also spoke in a low voice with someone:</p>
<p>"This is no ordinary school! From all over the towns and villages, our classmates have returned from there, wanting to gain profound knowledge."</p>
<p>"Those who have returned from the front lines of life are indeed different. I studied for seven years in the past, but it's not comparable to one day of classes here."</p>
<p>Facing the lawn was the open reading room. Although I can't see it now, the impression is as clear as the scene before my eyes. Every morning, before the newspaper delivery, people were already waiting there quietly. The newspaper was always held down by this hand or that hand, and I often waited, the time extending silently, still crowded, so I focused on the posture of the newspaper readers. Most of them were thinking as they read, one question after another, revealing a passionate half-profile. Impatient, I would squeeze in and read with them.</p>
<p>Leaving the reading room, small groups of two or three walked towards the lawn, talking softly. Originally, I had only a vague understanding of international politics, but in this atmosphere of several months, I began to have a clearer understanding. I began to understand to take notes on major domestic and international events in a small notebook.</p>
<p>R Road, a street I commemorate.</p>
<p>Walking more than a mile west from the red Western-style house, there is a north-facing house, in which there is a room, and I occupied a space with a bed. Riazanov's popular English translation, I was there leaning against the wide window, reading a section, then looking out over the square open space, my gaze resting on a corner of the distant sky. There, I had intense friendships, and we often talked until late at night. I remember one evening, I wrote the following lines of poetry:</p>
<p>"I have no other thoughts, I am only immersed in learning and friendship."</p>
<p>"Quiet life is leaping, like a swift wind sweeping across the autumn sky."</p>
<p>R Road, a street I commemorate. I couldn't help but walk back the way I came, heading east. Unfortunately, it wasn't quitting time, otherwise, I would have seen thousands upon thousands of workers, becoming a flood, overflowing in all directions. And I would have heard the banter of male and female workers, dissolving their fatigue of the day. I reached the eastern end of R Road, the filthy river, unchanging year after year, as if it were a reservoir of sweat full of dust and coal smoke from the workers' bodies. The factory buildings still stood tall and solemn, the sound of machines still ringing and roaring, but standing by the river, I no longer felt filled with the romantic revolutionary fervor that could be sung and wept.</p>
<p>That was five years ago. Walking on R Road, I thought of the past, which stands at the crossroads in my memory.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Literary Talk Outside the Door <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(10) No Need to Panic</p>
<p>Last time I said that among the illiterate masses, there have always been writers. I haven't been to the countryside for a long time. Previously, when farmers had some free time, such as when cooling off, someone would tell stories. However, these storytellers were usually specific people who had relatively more knowledge and were good at speaking, able to make people listen, understand, and find it interesting. This is the writer, and copying down his words is the work. If someone's language is uninteresting and they are overly talkative, people won't listen and will give them cold remarks—satire. We have been using literary Chinese for thousands of years and vernacular Chinese for over a decade. Everyone who can write is not necessarily a literary figure, right? Even if they all became literary figures, they are not warlords or bandits, so they would not harm the masses, but just read each other's works.</p>
<p>There is also a fear of the decline of literature. The masses do not have the cultivation of old literature, and compared to the refinement of the literature of the literati, it may appear to be "declining." But it is not infected with the chronic diseases of old literature, so it is vigorous and fresh. Anonymous literature such as "Midnight Song" will give old literature a new strength, as I said before; now some people have also introduced many folk songs and stories. There is also drama, such as the "Self-Biography of the Impermanence Ghost" cited in "Picking Flowers at Dawn" from "Mulian Saves His Mother," which says that because he sympathized with a ghost, he temporarily released him back to the world for half a day, but was punished by Yama and never dared to be lenient again.</p>
<p>"I fear neither copper walls nor iron walls!</p>
<p>I fear neither imperial relatives nor nobles!"</p>
<p>How humane, how knowledgeable, how law-abiding, and how decisive! Can our literary figures do this?</p>
<p>This is a true work of farmers and manual laborers, occasionally performed by them, using Mulian's pilgrimage to string together many stories. Except for "Little Nun Going Down the Mountain," it is completely different from the carved "Mulian Saves His Mother." One section, "Wu Song Fights the Tiger," is played by two people, A and B, one strong and one weak. First, A plays Wu Song and B plays the tiger, and A beats B so hard that B complains. A says, "You are the tiger, if I don't beat you, won't you bite me to death!" B has to ask to switch roles, but is bitten so badly by A that he complains again. A says, "You are Wu Song, if I don't bite you, won't you beat me to death?" I think this is in no way inferior to the fables of Aesop of Greece or Sologub of Russia.</p>
<p>If we collect such works all over the country, there will probably be many more. But naturally, there are shortcomings. It has always been blocked by difficult characters and difficult articles, and isolated from modern trends of thought. Therefore, if Chinese culture is to move upwards together, we must promote mass language, mass writing, and even more so, the Latinization of writing.</p>

<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Once, I saw in the newspaper that the war had started again. It seemed very fierce, and representatives of seven or eight large armies were busy. This one ran over, that one ran over. Then there were telegrams. This one wanted to defend his homeland, and that one wanted to defend his homeland. The situation was getting tense step by step. And it was large-scale. The area where the front lines met was not far from where my younger brother was. Naturally, they would participate in the front lines again this time.</p>
<p>I was very worried about him. He was just a probationary officer at this time, and it would be no problem to send him to the front lines. He used to send a letter once a week, but after a month, he didn't send any more. I was very anxious and wrote to ask the family, and the family also wrote to ask me. Maybe he's dead this time. The newspaper once published such a message, saying that in this war, many foreigners took telescopes and watched the battle on high mountains, seeing the two armies fighting hand-to-hand, with tens of thousands of casualties, and thought that even the First World War was no more than this. Ah, it's over! I sadly threw the newspaper aside, looking at the gray sky outside the window, and I regretted that I hadn't persuaded my younger brother to go home earlier!</p>

<h3 id="e256">After the Invention of Machines <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The civilization of the twentieth century is the civilization of machines. Since the invention of machines in the nineteenth century, human society has undergone a drastic change. This change has determined the fate of modern humans. After the invention of machines, what kind of impact did they have on human society? This varies depending on people's different perspectives.</p>
<p>Some people say that after the invention of machines, the productive forces of society suddenly increased hundreds of times. In the era of handicrafts, the production methods were extremely crude, relying only on human hands and crude tools to manufacture goods, so the productive forces were very weak. The machine industry era was much more advanced. After the production methods were improved, one machine was enough to replace the work of hundreds or thousands of people, so the productive forces increased day by day. As productive forces increased, humanity's material desires were fully satisfied. Moreover, along with the increase in productive forces, the material construction of society naturally progressed. Before the nineteenth century, had the world ever seen a huge ship like the modern one that traverses the vast ocean? Had it ever seen an electrical engineering project like the modern one that can supply the needs of all residents of a large city? These material constructions are precisely the gifts of the invention of machines.</p>
<p>However, another group of people say that after the invention of machines, a clear phenomenon that appears before our eyes in society is the vast gap between the rich and poor classes of humanity. After the invention of machines, although the productive forces of society have increased greatly, this increase is only the happiness of a few who own machines, while the majority of laborers have fallen into an extremely miserable situation. Here there is a distinction between the bourgeoisie and the working class that did not exist before the nineteenth century. The existence of this kind of class is the evil produced after the invention of machines. In addition, the second bad fact after the invention of machines is the mechanization of human work. Work is sacred, but it must have some interest. Before the invention of machines, human work was mostly based on one's own abilities and interests, so the work was somewhat artistic. However, after machines were invented, the working situation changed. Countless workers work in factories. On the surface, it seems that the workers are driving the machines, but in reality, the machines are using the workers. Workers have simply become slaves to the machines. The dryness and monotony of this kind of work can be imagined.</p>
<p>The above two statements each have their own partial reasons. But the great contribution that machines have made to our human society is a clear fact that no one can deny. And the various bad pathological conditions that have arisen are innumerable. However, in our observation, the invention of machines cannot but be said to be the infinite happiness of mankind. Because we have machines, we can use their power to improve our human lives and raise our human culture. As for the bad influences that they have left us, as long as we humans are good at using and adjusting them, and can use them well in beneficial aspects, the bad parts are not difficult to eliminate immediately. Otherwise, the machine itself has no toxicity. The various evils presented by modern human society due to the invention of machines are all expressions of human's own sins.</p>
<h3 id="e257">A Memory of Boating on the Liwa Lita River <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>It's a past event, originally a very interesting subject matter, I don't know why it has been delayed until today that I pick up my pen to write a "recollection." My personality is a bit "indolent," and even writing has been infected, which should be very dangerous. I have this self-awareness.</p>
<p>Liwa Lita is a famous place in Shanghai. That day, I went swimming with some friends in the afternoon, and we agreed to go boating again in the evening. At eight or nine o'clock in the evening, a bright moon hung outside the eastern horizon, and the milky white light shone through the sleeping universe, exceptionally serene and exceptionally comfortable. We were sitting in a group on the school's lawn, talking about everything. Tong, like a monkey, jumped and shouted nearby, saying that the boat was ready, and Nan Gong had already paddled a few rounds. In fact, saying it was ready was not as accurate as saying it had been stolen, the boat was from the school, and it was always locked up and not open to the public. Tong had a key that happened to fit, so he had the exclusive right to boat every night. When we got to the riverbank, we found that Ru had dropped out. Ju said he was preparing snacks, and we were relieved that he wasn't "missing."</p>
<p>We stole two boats. The cabins were narrow. It seemed that the boat builders had only intended them for lovers to paddle. It was indeed a bit crowded for three people to sit, and as soon as we sat on them, the boats seemed to sink, and the draft was particularly deep. So a problem arose. There was "Luo," whose weight was always over 300 pounds. There were six of us in total, and each boat was supposed to have three people, which was fair and selfless, but only he was difficult to allocate. After pushing and pulling for a while, Ru finally pulled him onto his boat.</p>
<p>Originally, everyone was in high spirits. It was late at night, and the weather was particularly cool and comfortable. The two boats raced for a few laps. When everyone reached the point where their strength was exhausted, they propped up the punts and stopped in the middle of the water. This was when Ru showed off his merits. He put the prepared soda and snacks on the bow of the boat. This was completely a practice of communism, no, it was simply directing a looting behavior, and they were snatched away in a flash. However, there is something to be praised, which is that although it was looting, it was still evenly distributed. The six mouths stopped at the same time. The so-called looting was actually just a different word for "playing around."</p>
<p>The time was unusually quiet, and the people were unusually happy. We sipped soda and chewed on candy. All the past frustrations and sorrows that everyone had disappeared like lightning. The endless discussions and endless laughter made us seem like six natural darlings, all living in paradise.</p>
<p>Just as we were chewing happily and talking forgetfully, two boats of the same size suddenly paddled over from the right. They were two pairs of lovers, the rustling sound of oars echoing the continuous singing, drawing our attention. Everyone couldn't help but feel sentimental. We were all too pitiful and too distressed. If only... it would be a scene to envy.</p>
<p>So we mustered our strength again, re-rocked our oars, endured the watery shadows of the moon, and paddled to the dark end of the river. Ah, there were more secrets here. Countless boats were quietly propped up on the bank. Some were snuggling and sleeping in the cabin, and some were on the shore, squatting and whispering. Suddenly a burst of nervous lewd laughter came from the shadows. This environment made us unbearable, and we agreed to row back to the other side of the river. Before long, we rowed to Liwa Lita Village. This is a scenic spot, an elegant scene. On the shore is a huge paradise, with dance floors, cafes, the reflection of neon lights, and the noisy sound of jazz music. Kun listened ecstatically, his eyes still wide open. I deliberately turned the boat left and right, scaring him to the point of trembling, and he begged me for mercy. In a flash, Tong and the others' boat had disappeared. It turned out that they could no longer resist the temptation of this environment and had rowed to the dock to go ashore. We had no choice but to row back quickly. At this time, there was no sound, and the silence was so profound that it seemed like there were small insects jumping and chirping in the grass on the shore.</p>
<p>This night's outing, although it dispelled a lot of pent-up feelings, also suffered endless annoyance, especially afterwards the body felt particularly tired. Lying on Ju's bed, I slept until noon the next day, still unable to get out of bed like a lazy snake.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Singing for the Sun <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>("The bottom nature of human beings is to experience the sun,</p>
<p>Our deep and heavy temperament should not be against the sun." 丨丨 D·HJ· Lawrence: "Birds, Beasts and Flowers")</p>
<p>Let's just say that the arena of life should be like purgatory, that's fine: Looking at the sea of future days, what undulates in between is hunger, shame, suffering, adversity: For many years, using one eye to look at the movement of social history, but also having to keep one eye on taking care of one's own survival. There are no red cherries and yellow pineapples in the mixed wine of human life, we know this best, but we keep drinking it.</p>
<p>Let's say that life is like purgatory, but there is also a chance to see the sun in purgatory. In the morning, isn't it? The sun is big, red, like a cartwheel sunflower, releasing many needles. People look at it, and their eyes are scorched: but it is hot, healthy, hardworking, and powerful, this light, eliminating the darkness of the night, blackening the pale skin of the young masters and ladies. Filling the wheat ears of autumn, seeping into the curtains of the hospital ward, accompanying the wanderings of the lonely.</p>
<p>But, if the arena of life is really like purgatory, then that is something to be thankful for. Really, purgatory is heaven for us. Isn't it? Even in purgatory, you can see the sun; but we live on the underground floor, and for people living on the underground floor, the sun exists forever only in the fiction of dreams.</p>
<p>People living on the underground floor have no memories, no planning, no sadness, and no suspicion. Of course, the memories of the past and the planning for the future have simply become a kind of decoration for us. We have no right to want these things. At first, we can't want them, but, you know, after getting used to the darkness, we simply disdain them. All we know is "now", "now" is real, bloody, but we have to grasp it, grab it desperately, not letting it slip away; otherwise, we would have long lost the possibility of survival. Just like the old miners who work in the underground floor of the mine day and night, hammering the dead coal lumps minute by minute, they have to concentrate their attention on the present instant. If you encounter an accidental explosion, you must have the agility of a dog to immediately lie down, otherwise you will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Of course, no one wants to be destroyed. In this way, even if they are old, they have to grasp the flashing moment of the existing present. Who can still remember the lively chrysanthemums and laughter of their youth, and the sunshine of their childhood that once shone on them?</p>
<p>But people living on the underground floor know how to commemorate the sun; the sun should not be a dream, people in a previous moment may have seen his bright arm, and then it forever becomes an indelible memory. And at present, in the dark crowd, the sun is talked about like a myth.</p>
<p>Remembering, remembering; no, even striving to search for it, but what's the use? The sun and we are isolated, isolated by the thick curtain woven by the heavy whips of life.</p>
<p>It is surprising that the sun of the twentieth century has also been commodified; "Upper-class people" play tennis, swim, and perform gilded love comedies under the sun; that sun is also hot, charming, of the southern orchards.</p>
<p>And these are not for the people living on the underground floor, we don't have them.</p>
<p>But it is not that we who live on the underground floor are inherently without them. We got them and then were isolated from them. How difficult it is for people to try to tear away this layer of life's curtain. However, for the sake of the sun, we can endure anything.</p>
<p>People without the sun cannot live, so their children are without the sun? Who says that? That's right, even if they live on the underground floor, the sun still exists in their memories, forever, forever.</p>
<p>Even if it's just in memory, I have my sun, and only my sun can make me live.</p>
