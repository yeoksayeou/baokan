<p>時評</p>
<h3>倚賴推諉與研究日本廷</h3>
<p>國人向來的通病是倚賴病。東北未盡丢以前。倚賴不抵抗主義。剛丢以後。倚賴國聯和美國出來打［抱不平。］不料國聯不中用。美國太持重。便想倚賴蘇聯和日本火併一下。外交途徑。不盡順利。又想倚賴日本人内部出亂子。希望他們發生空前大革命。因爲日本果眞革命了。當然會自顧不暇。那時。收回東北。豈不易如反掌。至於天下有没有這樣僥倖便宜的事。儘可付諸命運。　　不過無論如何。染了倚賴病的人。總還不會忘情於其所希冀的目標。换句話説。國人抱着國聯美俄從旁援助和日本發生革命的奢望。總還想恢復東四省。現在呢。似乎症候更危險了一層。因爲大多數的人。認爲倚賴各方。没有多大希望。不倚賴罷。又看不見出路。所以又由倚賴病一變而爲推諉病。你推諉我不幹。我推諉你無能。好在國家大事。人人有責。你不盡力焉能怪我。於是各行其素。各求其安。國内民氣。便自蓬勃而冷淡。自冷淡而凍結。可憐數千萬同胞所托命的東四省。在關内一般人的心目中。恐已没有多少濃厚的印象了。</p>
<p>近聞佔全民極少數的智識階級中的極少數人。也許因爲自覺力特别敏鋭。感受的痛苦特别深刻。不得已乃在孤軍獨鬥。孜孜鑽求於日本的經濟雜誌和科學雜誌。推測他們的心理。似乎不在滿足初步的智識慾。便算了事。日人所以認爲這種研究含義深遠。不是區區［皮肉的現象。］着眼亦在於此。不過以極少數摃筆桿的人。居然想獨肩國家興亡的重擔子。而又不得不借助乞靈於敵方的資料。去求貫澈。究有成效多少。固不必論。而其苦心孤詣的地方已足够我們嘆息不置的了。</p>
<p>自九一八後。國内大多數人由倚賴而推諉。由推諉而實行其所安。事實具在。是無可諱言的。現在我們所希望於國民和政府的。第一要趕快醫好推諉病和倚賴病。明白承認自己的差誤。不要禱神求鬼。或怨天尤人。尤其是政府要引導大家去做［知其不可爲而爲之］的工夫。迎頭研究日本。便是做這種工夫的方法之一。</p>
<p>説到研究日本。和普通做學術上的研究工夫有些不同。我們要存一個成見在胸。不要因研究結果。給日本表面上的種種進步嚇退了。要知道日本比較中國固然强的多。而和歐美相抗衡。仍不免有落伍之嘆。我們越研究日本。越要恢復民族的自信力。越要消滅倚賴和推諉的劣根性。現在國内曾往日本留學的人不少。其中有些人。也許因爲了解［知己知彼］的大道理太過透澈了些。頭腦中牢埋着日本了不得的模型。不肯輕易地把牠撲碎。過猶不及。一樣的亟待改良。</p>
<p>有的人说。在這國難聲中的非常時。空氣沉悶。至於不想説話。還不如研究什麽日本問題成蘇聯問題。借以解嘲的好。不知道以研究爲解嘲。正如以逃禪爲超脱。同樣的没出息。同樣的跳不出倚賴和推諉的圈子。不幸而至此。我們亦要設法矯正一下才是。</p>

<h3>大空軍主義威脅日本</h3>
<p>世界社云、蘇聯在近年積極屬目於遠東航空路之進出、莫斯科伊爾庫資克綫已延長至海參崴、餘如由伯力經尼港抵北樺太之沃哈綫、以及由該綫中間之馬林斯克以抵北樺太之亞港綫、威爾弗奴勤斯克庫倫綫、尼港彼得洛泡羅斯克綫、均已各各實施、</p>
<p>在上述之綫路之中、其最值吾人之注意者、爲伯力樺太綫、此綫在一九三○年一月開始、除每月四號十號十一號之三日外、每隔五日運航於伯力活哈綫、（需時八小時四五分）以及伯力亞港綫（需時六小時四十五分）、該航空路除具有夜間航空設備外、且具有中間飛行塲三、及臨時降落塲十五、</p>
<p>對於蘇聯之大空軍主義、最感威脅者當然爲日本、如以海參崴爲中心點、描一現代平凡之爆擊機所具有之一千五百粁之活動半徑、則朝鮮全土·關東州·滿洲·北海道·千島·樺太·本州·四國·九州·冲繩·惠美大島均將被囊括於該圈内、卽以一半一百粁而論、朝鮮大部分及日本沿海岸地方之一部分、亦將在敵機威脅之下、在最近蘇聯當局以最積極的攻擊日本爲目標、特别置重於航續力之耐久、已在設計建造一ＴＢ｜二型之重　擊機、該機可乘十六人、裝有純國産　一七型六百馬力發動機大基、時速二百四十粁、航續力有十四小時之多、如由海參崴向東京進襲、則僅需五小時、卽達東京上空、可以在五小時内從容從事爆擊及空中戰鬥、</p>
<p>至於戰鬥機、最近蘇聯當局將Ｉ一五型（時速三百粁）之戰鬥機加以改良、裝置純國産Ｍ二二型七百馬力之發動機、最大時速增加至五百十粁、由大阪以至東京、可以在一小時餘之期間内翔破、</p>
<p>偵察機則有Ｒ六型、此爲裝備純國産Ｍ三四型八百馬力發動機之複座機、最大時速二百四十粁、航續力七小時、作爲中距離偵察機、其實戰的價值、實大堪注目也、</p>

<h3>廣田集全力</h3>
<p>打開日美外交出路</p>
<p>華聯社東京通信廣田弘毅自接任外長職、其外交認識確有轉變、廣田外相處理其外交之方針、與内田一樣承認亞洲門羅主義、惟其方法有異、内田外相不顧世界之非難、在荒木陸相之武力支持下、强行所謂焦土外交、旣願全國爲焦土、何苦又要談到外交、廣田外相乃爲清算此矛盾而當外長職、則欲以外交手段坐收與傾國武力而將得之一樣效果、廣田外相認爲日本欲遂行其大陸政策、最賣力反對者爲英美俄三國、中國則爲其犠牲之對象、英國因其國内不寗、不敢輕與日本動干戈、故爲日本死對頭之國家、僅有美俄而已、中國雖欲反抗、現在之國力打不過日本、如美俄不出阻、則日可在中國行其所欲爲矣、此爲廣田外交之基本認識、在此認識之下、廣田外相打開外交僵局之唯一手段、則先取和美政策、如得美國默認其東洋政策、［滿洲國］問題可謂日方之勝利、日外務省在此方針之下、集其外交界之精鋭進攻美國、九一八事變後担任對美外交之日要人甚衆、則新渡户博士·德川家達公爵（前任上院議長）·石井菊次郎子爵（前外長）·松方乙彦侯爵（羅斯福之老同學）及近衛文磨公爵（現任上院議長擬五月十七赴美）等、此等要人從旁工作、帮助大使齋藤博推進和美外交之工作、其目標如左、</p>
<p>（一）日本承認菲島之永遠中立、但美國須由該島撤回陸海空軍之根據地、（二）美國修改移民法、削除排日條欵、（三）美國承認［滿洲國］爲旣成之事實、在相當之時機予以承認、或不再重申史汀生原則、而日本則重申［滿洲國］實行門户開放及機會均等、日方且願與美恊定對華北投資之安全問題、（四）在右列各原則得美國同意之后、日願放棄軍備平等權、日外部則以此内容向美方提議、在此種了解之下、日美間可訂立十年間之互不侵犯條約、此係日方片面之要求、美方放棄史汀生原則、於目前之國内情勢、確不容易、且互不侵犯條約案、其内容比一九二八年之非戰公約内容更爲進步、美國共和黨自九一八事變后、非難日方撕破此約甚力、雖羅斯福對日有歷史的情感、亦不容易翻雲覆雨、此點日外部亦甚了然、惟特製造空氣並刺探美國之輿論耳、齋藤大使於五月底返國后、對右舉各項之報告、確值我國之注意、</p>

<h3>日人在歐洲方面的活動（續）世界電訊社</h3>
<p>經濟與政治並進各國咸受其威脅</p>
<p>利用金錢作不利於我國之惡宣傳</p>
<p>埃第阿皮的情形是如此、埃第阿皮以外、紅海兩岸的其他幾處地方、如埃及·如叙利亞·如伊剌克的情形、也都大同小異、埃及本是英國人自信可以藉政治勢力長久獨佔的市塲、但因爲日金跌價、日工資奇賤、同日本女子與孩童也隨着男子晝夜不停地工作的緣故、日貨價額低到萬分、英貨無論如何競爭不過、十年工夫、日本對埃及的輸出、由五十五萬八千英磅一躍而到二百十五萬二千英磅、反之、英國在尼爾阿畔的貿易、單就蘭卡市所産紡織品一項而論、就減少了一半的銷售、</p>
<p>以上所叙述的、是日本人對歐洲經濟的活動這種活動、無論是在歐洲或在歐洲以外歐洲人向來視爲經濟勢力範圍内的地方、總之、是歐洲人自九一八以來逐漸深刻感受到的一種威脅、九一八以前、歐洲人以爲日本的武力、是不可侮的、日本在東亞的地位、是他們所無可奈何的、九一八以後、經過許多新事實、於是他們進一步而感到日本的可怕、不僅僅限於太平洋、日本的侵略、不僅僅恃賴軍實、在歐美百業不振的今日、居然還有日本人來搶奪他們靠着生存的歐洲市塲、這不由得他們不起戒心、不回憶到［黃禍］的幻影、</p>
<p>經濟的活動之外、我們再看一看政治的活動、自從日本退出國際聯盟以來、日本表面上在歐洲似乎没有什麽政治的活動、其實不然、九一八事件發生時、歐美正處於經濟恐慌的危局、無論美·俄·英·各大國對遠東的劇變、都無過問的實力、這些國家知道眼前的日本、是在那裏趁火打刧、溷水撈魚、如果你没有眞正的力量足以壓服他、那麽、他是不肯罷休的、所以與其意氣用事、孟浪的對他决裂、自取侮辱母寗隠忍一時、以待將來各國本身困難解决之後、再圖萬全的對付、日本也看穿了這着、所以奪得了東北四省之後、暫時停止進一步的侵略、先盡全力去經營充實已得的土地、以鞏固大陸方面的根基、這須看近來日本在東北的種種動作、就自然明白、一方面對於軍事的整頓他們片刻也不停止、日本海軍的實力、比較英美、早已超過五五三的比率、因爲表面上日本的艦數噸數、雖合於五五三的比率、事實上日本藉名爲他國（如南美各國）在那裏建造許多軍艦、一旦有事、造船的不交貨給定船的、那許多軍艦、就一律變成日本自己的軍艦了、海軍是這樣、陸軍空軍也不斷的在那裏擴充、同時溥儀僭位、這自然是日本對中國·對世界·一個意義深長的警告、雖然美俄的復交、多少足以增添日本人的顧忌、然而美俄的難操勝算、日本人知道、美俄的隠忍自重、不肯輕易嘗試、日本人也知道、日本所打算的、不在現在而在未來、</p>
<p>未來日本所怕的、（一）是於中國·於太平洋·有利害關係的美英俄三國對日的共同動作、（二）是中國的復興、凡有歷史的智識、了解世界大勢的人、對後者是無疑問的、雖然緩速難以預斷、前者或可因後者而不見諸事實、反之、後者愈多費時日、則前者愈不可避免、莫索里尼氏所謂［太平洋的運命、繫於本世紀内中國人所去的脚色］若這樣解釋、最有意義、總之、日本對歐洲的活動、完全以這兩個念頭作中心、卽一方面藉德法以牽制英·俄·美、使他們自顧不暇、一方面極力掩飾他在中國挑撥離間、求延長中國的混亂、使中國不統一的陰謀、復利用國際新聞界的收　、同他自己通信社的宣傳、使歐洲人士對中國失望、使中國在國際地位日益墮落、</p>
<p>日本這種宣傳事業的巧妙靈活、實值得讚嘆、日本政府同財界對這種事業所支出的費用、不是眼前吾人的力量所能及、凡是日本聯合社發來的消息、没有不登的、發電的地方、如果僅是日本、僅是日本估領的東北、倒也不足怪、妙的是常常有載明南京上海北平或廣州來電的消息、那麽、應該是中國方面的消息了、而説的常常是無中生有、揑造出來、矇蔽歐洲讀者、誣辱中國的話、譬如説某某親日、某某要人主張中日合作、再不然、便是某將軍同某將軍又火拚、再不然、便是共産黨逼近某地、某處土匪猖獗、再不然、便是某處邊疆獨立、這些消息、十個中間往往也有一個近於眞的、其爲不利於中國的消息、則千篇一律、因爲有重德泅水一流常川駐歐、精通歐洲新聞事業的人、因爲又有錢、所以這些消息送去、不但没有不登的、登時而且説是來自南京、報紙上就是來自南京、説是來自廣州、報紙上就是來自廣州、反正日本人向歐洲報紙供給中國的消息、中國人自己還在夢裏、涓滴之水、可成江河、這樣的惡耗、時常給你在歐洲報紙雜誌上發表、試問一般僅靠報紙得到知識的人們、對中國能不能有好感想好印象、可憐中國在九一八以後、才在歐洲有個通信社日子還淺、資本又有限、然而幸而有這個通信社、歐洲人漸漸從中國人手裏得到眞正的中國消息、僅就過去短時期間、這通信社的貢獻、説已經是十分可貴、然要作到同日本聯合社比肩、必須有雄厚的資本、必須有政府的獎勵、同實業界切實久遠的辅助、</p>
<p>這是説日本人對歐洲藉宣傳以矇蔽事實、以毁損中國、至於日本的想利用德法以制英俄美、這也是顯然的事實、德國同日本同是退出國際聯盟的國家、希特勒掌政以來、德俄不相能、俄國如有事於遠東在西歐方面、難免有後顧之憂、當日俄關係險惡的時候一部份人士、盛傳德日新成立一種諒解、法國在遠東没有什麽利益、但法國的右黨、覺得英美俄如在太平洋同日本發生糾紛、法國在歐洲的地位、就不致動摇、法國的外交、就很簡單、不致於時常顧慮到英國態度的豹變、不致於感到蘇俄共黨的壓迫、不致於往往爲美國經濟的外交的勢力所左右、日本對法國還有一種暗算、就是吸收法國鉅額的資本到滿洲、將來這些資本、也許得到同法國借與帝俄的資本一樣的結果、换言之、化爲烏有、但至少眼前日本人可以活用這資本去開發東北、同時可在東北利用法國去抵制俄美、這把如意算盤、不幸同法國右黨所想的有一部份共同的利害、所以九一八後、法國右黨内閣時、日本暗中極力進行日法同盟的提議、又多方慫思法方成立百萬萬佛郎的借欵、不過兩者在法國左黨都是通不過的、所以終於未有結果、新近法國急進社會黨失勢、不久便有日法合组銀行圑從滿洲産業經營的計劃行將實現的消息、我們希望這只是日本向法國大規模借欵失敗後的一種餘波、希望法國右黨政治家、不至墮入日本狡獪的圈套、（三月十四日於巴黎）</p>

<p>第三、增加潛伏勢力、第一個步驟已成過去、卽長城各口戰事之終止是也、第二個步驟、爲馬蘭峪與察東二四兩區日軍之增加、第三個步驟、卽　灤東察東土匪之擴充編制與接濟、及冀察兩省土匪之聯絡、兩種步驟、均已逐漸完成、以前各特務工作人員、現已奉命中止活動、并將日使館華北特務活動費每月一百萬元裁撤、另成立國際軍事偵察部、是項部之固定地點、傳在天津、一説在北平、分男女兩組、男組首領傳爲荒木忠次郎女組首領則爲川島芳子、部長一職爲何人所擔任、尚無法探得偵探部之外、另有一測繪機關、似由日本駐屯軍直轄、測繪工作、係於去歳冬間開始、第一測繪目標、卽爲黃河、由洛陽至開封一段、已經測竣、内容爲（一）河身之寛窄、（二）河底之深淺、（三）兩岸之攻守地勢、（四）某段宜於渡河、（五）現在船隻之調查、第二測繪目標、卽爲察蒙與新疆聯絡之路綫、及貫通綏新出路之捷徑、現正在開始工作中、由熱河以至西蒙、設有電臺二十餘處、而測繪隊逐步前進、短波電臺、亦逐漸增加、</p>
<p>現在目的</p>
<p>日主現在對於華北、雖積極作侵略之恫嚇聲勢、但實際並不急於囊括華北、此殆爲日軍部旣定之政策、惟近來在國在外之軍人、亦分兩派主張、在國派着重於對俄、非至與俄宣戰之時、不願有所舉動、在外派則恐時間過遲、轉造成華俄軍事聯絡之機遇、故主張在華北建樹第二傀儡、以分化中國内部之實力、及在華北之政治軍事統治權、斯事前途之勝利、究竟歸於何派、此時未能悉其底蕴、外間有傳日本將助傀儡侵入北平、以建僞都者、實則完全係揣測之詞、日對傀儡、只有利用之餘地、而無恊助之可能、且絶不願傀儡養成氣力、已彰明較著、故其現在之目的、如在外軍人派戰勝利、則爲樹立華北第二傀儡、在國軍人派戰勝、則暫時放棄侵佔華北之野心、</p>
<p>將來企圖</p>
<p>日人現在積極西進之目的、實際爲佔領新疆塔城、對於察哈爾、似尚無若何企圖、但并非無此野心、特時間未成熟耳、其侵佔塔城之用意、一方阻蘇俄兩極端陸軍之聯絡、一方切斷中蘇溝通之路缐、免腹背受敵之大忌、據外人方面所得可靠消息、日人凖備以一年之長時間、而達到其目的、各項軍隊配備、亦正在調度中、完全採新式組織、戰車隊與化學藥隊、殆爲全軍之骨幹、而騎兵又將佔主力十分之六、預料是項企圖完成之時、卽爲日俄戰爭爆發之期、現在所傳之日俄戰爭空氣、距離時間尚遠也、</p>

<h3>孔祥熙昨晨抵滬發表書面談話</h3>
<p>華北吃緊未接任何報告</p>
<p>班洪事件係人意存挑撥</p>
<p>税收較前增加未借外債</p>
<p>中央社云、行政院副院長兼財政部長孔祥熙氏、前晚十一時、乘坐夜車離京來滬、昨晨七時二十分抵眞茹下車、逕返西愛咸斯路私邸休息、各報社記者、昨午訪晤孔氏於其私邸、當承接見、發表書面談話、茲特分紀如下、</p>
<p>華北形勢與前無異</p>
<p>（問）近日外間傳言、華北吃緊、黃委員長郛忽於此時南下、並傳汪院長及部長有飛贛之説、詳情如何、（答）華北方面、時有信使往來、個人方面、並未接有任何緊急報告、實與前此一般、至於外間謡言、聞係因張溥泉委員談話所引起、實際言之、現在全世界及我國全國、何處不在緊急狀况中、張委員前言之意、蓋恐國人存五分鐘熱度之心、宴安鴆毒、故大聲疾呼、以促國人之覺悟、堅强其愛國之心、至於黃委員長之南下、係述職之意、並無其他原因、黃委員長平日爲人、勇於負責、外面讕言、謂渠因華北緊急而棄職南歸、此可信其必無之事、華北固决無緊急消息、若果有之、則黃委員長以勇於負責之人、臨難而圖苟免、决無其理也、至汪院長之飛贛與否、尚無所聞、總之、蔣委員長係中政會常委之一、中央重要問題、當局自有與之晤商之必要、當此督勦期間、渠未便離軍、當局遇必要時、往贛面商、係尋常之事、外間不察、多所揣測、殊可不必、</p>
<p>班洪係班弄之誤傳</p>
<p>（問）報傳滇邊告警、詳情如何（答）外傳班洪事件、據個人所知、當係班弄之訛、班洪爲我國疆土、班弄則不屬我國也、中英邦交、素稱和睦、英國向具大國風度、當不致有武力侵略我國疆土之事、外傳云云、如非以訛傳訛、故甚其辭、則係有人意存挑撥、中傷中英國交、希望國人注意、</p>
<p>對外借欵並無其事</p>
<p>（問）外傳有外國銀圑以鉅欵借給我國之説、详情如何、（答）商借外欵、爲財部主管事件、本人以財長地位、絶未聞有此件、但近聞我銀行界有擬組織銀公司藉以利便將來外人投資我國建設事業之議、此事或係因此訛傳、查利用外資發展實業、原屬總理遺教所主張、個人認爲借欵以事建設、應屬於確實有利之生産事業、將來可資以償本付利者、而非如以前北平政府時代之濫借濫用、以致至今無法清償、内增人民之負擔、外損國家之信譽、與其借欵如此、不如節省緊縮、不事借債、至對國家債務、久具整理之心、惟須徐求辦法、至不能仰賴外國之借欵、觀現在世界經濟尚在不景氣之中、各國方籌舉債、正向其本國人民募集、而英美兩政府、且有不許别國在其國内借債之議、如此情形之下、卽使中國有意舉借外債、恐外人亦不能投資也、</p>
<p>税收方面較前增加</p>
<p>（問）近來財政狀况如何、（答）近來税收方面甚好、較前月比較增加、本人就任財部時、以開源節流昭示國人、近來外間僅知開源、而不知實際方面、現在軍政當局正積極於節流方面努力、希望於短期内、達到收支適合之鵠的、</p>
<p>西南合作可以實現</p>
<p>（問）近傳中央與西南合作問題、詳情如何、（答）近來中央與粤方信使往還頗頻、現在西南同志、以内憂外患之日深、經已覺悟、惟精誠圑結、可以救國、合作一舉、可望實現、此誠國家之福、蓋口言救國、而不能犠牲成見、徒唱高調、强人與我苟同、則救國適以害國誤國、將不待人之亡我、而我自趨於滅亡也、</p>

<h3>工部局核定本年度預算</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局本年度之經常及臨時收支預算案、及上年度（一九三三）之財政報告、昨由財務委員會提出於董事會會議、當經决議定案、</p>
<p>據財務處長向委員會報告、上年經常收入、除彌補一九三二年之虧欠外實爲一七·二五六·三五七兩、其中撥出一·六二三·四九○兩、以供教育之需、經常支出、連教育費在内、共一七·一八二·○○一兩、年終結算、計普通費尚餘一九·五九七兩、教育費尚餘五四·七五九兩、</p>
<p>上年經常收入方面、實收較預計約短七二八·○○○兩、此因當初估計不免略失之樂觀、而房屋空閉之數、亦超過预計之外、但同時各行政部分、對用欵均加謹愼、多數所費、時在規定之額以下、故收入雖减、而仍得扯平、</p>
<p>關於利息賬目、收入數計超出二五·○○○兩、但電氣處售價、末批已經交付、故此賬今後殆不克再有贏餘、查工部局近數年之收入、實虧缺約二厘市政捐之額、近兩年約以總凖備金提出彌補、然此只因有電氣處之售價而然、不可視爲常例、計近年因有此欵、已贖回公債三七·○○○·○○○兩、又爲一九二四至二七公債撥付减債基金一○·六○○·○○○兩、且自一九二九年起、各項建設費、總計約二九·六○○·○○○兩之數、均得以支付、而無俟乎舉債、否則、此項建設經費及公債所負利息、卽以五厘半計、勢需有五厘之市政捐、方能抵補、現在工部局負債之數、爲一九·五○○·○○○兩、而還債基金、則存有一二·○○○·○○○兩、兩抵約負債實只七·五○○·○○○兩、</p>
<p>論及一九三四年之預算、約計經常總收入額爲二四·四三一·七○○元、總支出（連教育費）二六·三九○·○六○元、不敷之數、已定由總凖備金提二·○○○·○○○元抵補、計應尚餘四一·六四○元、與上年比較、計收入方面增一·二八○·○○○元、（内地皮捐約可增九六○·○○○元、市政特捐·執照捐·市政總捐·及碼頭捐·均可增加、）支出方面、增一·四○六·○○○元、此則大抵因各行政部分事業增漲之自然結果、惟今後利息賬上、只能有虧無贏、則預算上之担負、將與年俱增、是以對於建設計劃、除極要者外、不可不力從緊縮也、</p>
<p>關於本年之臨時費預算、計總額（除教育臨時費）爲二四·七一○·八三○元、内有四·九五八·五七○元、係上年所虧之數、因彼時有欵墊付、故决定不舉債、以輕負担、而以此數歸入本年預算之中、至於本年、則需舉債、或以他項方法、籌出一五·五○○·○○○元、（此層在一九三○年卽經料及、）其具體辦法、俟納税人年會後、再行提請董事會核議、至本年之臨時支出、承各處長之切實合作、及各委員會之詳密考慮、已將其限於最急需不可再减之限度矣、</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在這座　　的後面，還有六乘全部漆着紅色的大轎，每一乘大轎，有八個太監抬着。這就是侍從女官們所乘坐的，我和我的妹妹容齡，便是其中之一。</p>
<p>整齊的行列，在一重極度肅靜的空氣裏前進着，人和馬都難得有聲音發出來，偶然可以聽到格拉格拉的幾響，那是笨重的轎槓，在轎夫的肩膀上轉動的聲音。除此以外，就祇那個天下聞名的大太監李蓮英，不時在前後左右走動，用一種雖低而極兇暴的聲音，向隊伍中的人呼叱着。因爲這些儀仗這些行列，事前都是由他一個人費了許多時候佈置下的，所以大家都得服從這個可怕的魔鬼的命令。</p>
<p>從頤和園的大門起，一直到熱河行宫的大門止，在這一條幾百里長的官道上，遍地舖着是金色的潮濕的黃沙，尋常的百姓們，不但不准走上這一條御道來。就是站在較遠的地方，瞭望鑾駕在這裏經過，也是要立斬不赦的，所以從來也没有人敢大膽違犯過。</p>
<p>行行重行行，這一條黃蛇似的御道，漸漸地折入蒼綠色的山谷中去了。我們暗暗在猜測太后這時候心頭上所懷的是怎樣的一種感想？伊離開熱河差不多已經有整整的五十個年頭了，那個地方，可算得是伊的發祥之地。其時，伊還是一個極美麗，極年輕的女人，伊在宫内的地位，却祇是咸豐皇帝的一個寵妃。因爲咸豐突然死了，便頓時勾起了朝中兩位權臣的陰謀，他們想把伊那年幼的兒子｜同治｜黜廢爲庶民，刦奪下他的皇位來。</p>
<p>雖然伊那時候對於朝中的一切情形，還是不很熟悉，伊也並没有什麽特殊的經騐，但是環境逼迫伊，使伊不得不用一種極巧妙的策略，去對付那兩個陰謀家｜弈訴和肅順。後來，伊就懷着滿腔的憂慮，把伊的兒子搶出了虎口，就在這一條黃蛇似的御道上，從熱河逃回了北平。（四）</p>
<h3>怎麽樣談話？</h3>
<p>— 沈敏行</p>
<p>一個善於談話的人，他利用美妙的言詞，和詼諧的音調，以引起他人的聽覺，而使他人傾倒，這種人，在一生中，一定會佔着不少的便宜。</p>
<p>所以一個善於談話的人，不但能使不相識的人見了他，會發生好感，並且能多識與多交許多朋友，再拿｜［一個人必須要有朋友］［朋友是我們的良師］［在外靠朋友］證實起來，那末善於談話的人，更能佔到莫大的便宜。</p>
<p>談話的精粗，優劣，最足以顯示出你的教育程度，與身分的高低，你的言語，往往會在無意之間，宣洩你一生的事蹟，你的談話，會將你一切隠秘宣佈出來，會將你的眞面目揭示給世界，</p>
<p>我們常常看到，有種人，心中有着意思，而詞不足以達，心中要想説話，而訥訥不能出口，這種人呢，可算是世界上最可憐的一種！</p>
<p>有些人有高超的思想，獨到的意見但是總不能出口，他們的語言，不足以將他們的思想裝扮得像個模樣，他們的話像走馬燈一般，説來説去總是一套，試問這種人，於社會上有什麽功効？</p>
<p>反之，這種人社會上需要嗎？</p>
<p>美國教育家伊立脱（Ｅliot）曾經説：［在造成一個［上流人］的教育中，有一種訓練是不能少的，就是：優美和文雅的談吐，］</p>
<p>所以談話的藝術是一種實用的需要，不能少的需要！</p>
<h3>雨底下</h3>
<p>— 尚文</p>
<p>雨在黎明的時候，便沙沙地下落了，但很小的：而空氣却變得異常的沉悶。似乎有霧，一切都混沌了起來，都染上了一層水蒸氣，濕漉漉地。</p>
<p>雨，到中午的時候，已下得很大了！天像比平時低了很多，空氣更加變得悶人：可惡的天氣，一絲風也没有，壓得人要透不過氣來了！</p>
<p>雨底下：想起我的傘，想起有傘的姐，三年雨底下和我在一起撑着傘的姐了！</p>
<p>九年前的事，那時候姐是愛我的，也没有去世。在雨底下，我們撑起一把傘。那傘是我們兩人的，一同從杭州買來的。</p>
<p>雨依舊的下着，我們的傘是綠悠悠地已褪成了蒼白色，算來已有九年了。姐姐呢，也死去三年了！</p>
<p>雨今天更下的猛了，打在我的身上，又印在我的心上。傘，丢掉了，雨底下，邁着我急遽錯亂的步子，兩行涙水從眼底下直流下來，被雨點打落了！</p>
<h3>大中華民國</h3>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十七回閩怨暗中消慈懷可感閒愁醉後起舊事難忘</p>
<p>楊桂枝這晚在床上幻想着消遣，自然是不免想到將來怎麽樣？可是一想到將來，便是這海甸街上，就有許多前例。有的是丈夫陣亡了，留下中年婦人，帶着弱小的兒女來過活。有的是兒子出去不歸，丢下年老的娘，天天在家裏盼望。若説自己未必就是這樣一個結果，但是落到這一步，那是可能的。再要説到黃曼英，他就不會了，他根本就是一個没有主的女人，和田連長的關係不過朋友而已。倒不必問田青的前途如何，就以現在而論，他要是去嫁什麽人的話，那是不犯法的。所以他很自由，對着家庭，對着朋友，毫不在乎，又公開的交上男朋友了。當時我見了他那朋大，都很替他害臊。可是他全没有那回事，還給我介紹，那是他表兄呢。這年頭兒原來男女談變愛就是這麽一回事，在一塊堆兒，親親熱熱的，恨不得變成一個人。可是掉轉身去，又各找各的愛人去了。自己呢。本來也有個愛人甘二爺。可是自己對於丈大很忠心的，和丈夫訂了婚以後，我就不把一點兒心事對他，他呢，大槪也知道我没有兩條心，就絶對不來逗引我了。假使他來逗引我，我能像黃曼英一樣，把他當表哥，引到家裏來談天嗎？桂枝將白天在黃家所看到的一件事，只管左盤右旋在腦筋裏轉着，想來想去，歸根還是那一個關鍵，人家是没有結婚的，自己是結了婚的，怎能有别人那樣自由？（三五五）</p>

<p>（九）葉九坑在溪頭西，有眉石，略爲粗慢。</p>
<p>（十）盧坑在縣西北，景祐中令曹平取之，守王君玉又取之，嘉祐中尉刁璆取之，石有青綠暈，今不復出。</p>
<p>（十一）濟源坑與碧裏水步，三坑並列，（水步石之有雨點白暈者，卽陸深春風堂藏書所稱之刷絲羅紋）。</p>
<p>（十二）靈巖山三洞相連，璞少瑕多，燥慢，瑩者擬端溪。</p>
<p>（十三）麻石中隠硯材數寸，猶玉在璞，在溪澗中，冬涸可取。</p>
<p>按以上所述各坑，據高似孫硯箋，當可信，惟據他書記載，尚有緊足，莊基，雨坑，與羅紋坑並列，其石次於舊坑，泥漿，棗心，綠石·三坑，在舊坑之側，泥漿石温潤細密，惟不甚堅實，棗心之細者，温潤可愛，中有小班租粗，微燥，綠石質稍嫩，以有羅紋者爲最上，水波坑與羅紋下坑相近，產瓜子羅紋，不可多得，惟因年代久遠，坑脈已不詳，廟前坑，在羅紋山古廟之前，潤如紫玉，有金星斑，宋景祐間曾發見一二，後卽不明其處。</p>
<p>各坑情形，大致如上述，惟其名材，亦往往在深溪中，須俟冬季水涸時，集數十工人發掘，偶一降雨，卽前工盡棄，開採之難，不下端溪之下巖，况宋後老坑盡皆廢塞，名材不復再出，非如端石之繼續發現，故歙硯而果爲舊坑之佳者，在今更可寳貴的。</p>

<h3>瘋女</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>是我去Ｗ城的第二天，在旅館的門口發現了一個奇異的女子，大約有二十來歳的年紀，穿着一件紫色底子起白花的棉袍，頭髮很長，梳得很光亮，圓圓的臉還長得相當的美麗，只是眼睛太凹下一點，望起人來時，好似老虎要吃人似的凶惡；一張嘴老是笑個不住，在旅館門口走來走出，咕哩咕嚕不知説些什麽。</p>
<p>男人走過時，她瞪起眼睛便駡，看到女人，她反哈哈地大笑起來。立刻，我明白這並不是四馬路一流的人物，而是個神經病患者。</p>
<p>吃晚飯時，尹先生告訴我，那瘋子是旅館經理的女兒，一個還未許人的［閨女］。</p>
<p>晚上十二點敲過後，忽聽得有摔凳子，關門的聲音，接着是潑婦似的惡駡，聲音凶惡而尖鋭，有時簡直像鬼呌一般。駡了一陣，又哈哈大笑起來；笑聲還没有停止，又放聲大哭；哭後又是摔東西，打玻璃，開門，關門，在天井裏吐痰，：：：閙得一塌糊塗。我想偷偷地開了房門出去，看看她究竟在幹什麽，但又覺得太可怕了，要是她追上我來，怎麽辦呢？卽使不追來，如果用什麽東西打傷了我，豈不白白地吃了傻虧？没有法，只好咬緊牙根眼睜睜地望着天亮。</p>
<p>［昨晚害怕不？］</p>
<p>早晨起來在天井裏嗽口時，尹先生這樣問我。</p>
<p>［阿彌陀佛，謝謝你告訴了我，所以今早還能起來。］</p>
<p>我這句話竟引得特和樓上的林都大笑起來。</p>
<p>我們吃稀飯時，瘋子拿一根油條在嘴裏嚼着，她望我們哈哈哈笑了一陣之後，又是一陣惡駡。我故意握緊拳頭裝出要打她的姿勢，她反而對我嫣然一笑；這時，我們竟完全受了她的支配也跟着笑了。</p>
<p>據説她瘋了四年了，許多人説這是［桃花病］，要結婚後，才能好的，但是天，這樣可怕的瘋女，誰敢娶她做老婆呢？［爲什麽早不嫁了她？］我問他們。</p>
<p>［她父親要選擇一個有錢的人才肯出嫁。］林説。</p>
<p>［但是有錢的人，要娶漂亮風騷的女人，誰又肯討個瘋婆呢？］</p>
<p>［是呀，他父親害了她一生！］</p>
<p>他們三個人都提議要我對瘋子的父親去説好話，使她得到解放。我笑着回答他們：</p>
<p>［你們誰肯娶她，她就得到解放了。］</p>
<p>又是一陣笑聲。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>前天接到尹先生來信，告訴我那個曾經駭得我一晚未睡的瘋狂底少女自殺了！得到這個消息後，我和特都感到凄然！</p>
<h3>航海</h3>
<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>没有太陽，西北風臘臘地吹着，暗灰色的天空擺着難看的臉色，海浪成排地推來，我們的船身便開始動摇不定了。</p>
<p>我一人立在尾樓上遙望，但見桅杆不住地向左右傾倒着，一點定力也没有似的，每逢一個浪頭打來，總有一班旅客被波及，損失了筷碗和打濕被服的人漸漸加多，他們便擠到中間去，然而中間也不是安全地帶，後來他們索興不再逃避了，坐待浪潮的來到，大家盲目地期待着環境自己能够改善。可是風和浪彷彿專和這班旅客開玩笑似的，旣没有大浪把他們捲去，也不立時平靜使他們安樂得所，老是這樣一波未平一波又起地把他們捉弄着。</p>
<p>遠處的天邊連一絲帆影都不能瞧見，只有我們這一葉孤舟在這寂寥的海中掙扎前進。</p>
<p>［生命的象徵啊！］我想。我們趁着這生命的孤舟，在這黯淡的人生海面上游行，前途的命運正不可知，而過去事又多半是不堪回首的。</p>
<p>現在，這不幸的孤舟，牠是負着使命，載着許多生命，要渡過風濤，駛向平安的佳境，這工作確是艱難的，可是他的船身還堅固，馬力也足，縱有險惡的打擊，也不能立時毁滅牠吧！雖然，這一趟行程確乎是負荷太重了一點，不過有了負擔，倒也可以减少牠内心的空虚和徬徨之苦，他現在唯一的企圖，就是衝破這灰暗的環境到達目的地。</p>
<h3>絮語</h3>
<p>— 瑕厂</p>
<p>（十五）</p>
<p>嚴首昇（平子）論小品文云：［此輩小傳小叙小記，頗足開顔。倘授以帝王本紀，名臣列傳，便閣筆矣。與之言性言天，能　亹到底，與之議天下事，能縷縷指掌，連續不盡乎？辟如小匠，築斗室，石橋，竹徑，厝置如意。一旦委以未央殿，承露盤，應袖手爾。而顧輕薄前輩，凌厲一時，去井蛙幾何也。］這當然是代表了正統派對於小品文的見解，這見解也可以説，並非基於文字的多寡，文體的大小，而實是出發於明代當時正統派作家，與小品文作家的思想的對立上，要以文字文體而論，實在是没有分别。</p>
<p>（十六）</p>
<p>檢舊抄本，又得小簡數則，皆關於雨中生活者，大有今日苦雨齋主人生活况味。其一爲莫廷幹（秋水）與黃望洲，文云：［雨中抱鬱，且人境塵喧，悲秋之士，極難爲情也。稍朗霽，西出圖面，不盡縷縷。］其二爲廷幹與徐文卿：［春雨雖佳，恨斷吾相知往還耳。不審齋頭作何事也？旦夕不晴，當須一面。案上置何書，且願聞之。］後一則，田園詩人的飄洒風姿，尤易見到。然叙雨中生活較詳者，則莫如徐世溥［巨源）與范大書。文云：［村居遇雨，來往絶人。自晨昏侍食之外，雖妻子罕見。居植修竹，間有鳥鳴。女墻低檻，疑近山岫。畫則讐校史書，夜則屈伸一榻。謝絶肥甘，疏遠苦醴。胸中無思，或會古今得失，一頓足而已。如此數日，天亦將晴，人亦將至，我亦將出，不可以不記也。因就燈書之。］舊時文人生活，於此可見一班。</p>

<h3>吉林民謡</h3>

<p>西村</p>
<p>騎毛驢，</p>
<p>上娘家，</p>
<p>道遠也不怕，</p>
<p>要看爹和媽。</p>
<p>一進娘家門，</p>

<p>哥哥看見瞧一瞧，</p>
<p>嫂子看見扭一扭。</p>
<p>［不用瞧，</p>

<p>不吃你們的飯與肉，</p>
<p>當天來，當天往回走！］</p>
<h3>［白話］［文言］新論</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>文章繁簡工拙之論，自唐宋平文運動初起時已有之：唐宋八家叢話記：［歐陽公在翰林日，與同院出遊，有奔馬斃犬於道，公曰，［試書其事。］同院曰：［有犬臥通衢，逸馬蹄而死之。］公曰：［使子修史，萬卷未已也。］曰，［内翰以爲何如？］曰：［逸馬殺犬於道。］</p>
<p>這有名的黃犬奔馬故事，他見於沈括夢溪筆談，陳善捫虱新語，其意大致相同。當時風尚，文人蓋以簡括爲貴。明人主張復古，亦多主簡：直到清初文人，始有兩可論斷，顧亭林云：［辭主乎達，不論其爲繁與簡也；繁簡之論興，而文亡矣。］可説是極通達的見解。</p>
<p>近來林語堂先生提倡語錄體，批評［今人作白話文，恰似古人作四六，一句老實話，不肯老實説出，憂愁則曰心弦的顫動，欣喜則曰快樂的幸福，受勸則曰接受意見，快點則曰加上速度。：：：便是嚕哩嚕囌，文章不經濟。］（論語二十六期）嚕哩嚕囌是［繁］，文章經濟是［簡］；推林先生之意，白話文的短處在繁，語錄體的長處在［簡］，這樣又回復到文章繁簡的爭辯舊圈子去了。當五四運動前後，提倡白話文的總説白話文是取口話爲文，使語文相接近：語體文盛行了十來年，結果却不是那麽一回事；女人筆下的白話文，有時會和引車賣漿者的口語相去十萬八千里。卽如林先生所引［母性之光］那一段［她的悲歌，她的血涙，觀衆們的同情傷感心弦的緊張｜｜就在這悲歌，血涙，觀衆們的同情傷感心弦緊張時，繡幕缓缓的垂落了］。的字幕，在引車賣漿者看來，並不比［子虚上林賦］來得容易。又如某詩人［詠石榴花］的名句：［越開越紅的石榴花紅得不能再紅了。］和厦門鼓浪嶼的［中華民國基督徙向孫中山先生遺像行三鞠躬禮認爲不合同盟會］，皆令人生白話文太嚕哩嚕囌之感。究竟白話文何以常是嚕哩嚕囌？白話文和文言文的不同之點在那里？語錄體是否有提倡之必要？我們應得重新考量一番的了。（未完）</p>
<h3>湖上的春</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>車到杭州了。</p>
<p>我的心給一個美麗的夢幻纏得緊緊的：西湖在那裏呢？我是那麽渴想着這江南的名勝呵！</p>
<p>坐上了黃包車，到湖濱去。｜｜一行十七個人，十七輛車子連接着在杭州的街上跑過。我想：杭州的春天是晴朗的，風是輕微的：我這顆十九歳的心在這里也應當愉快起來吧？</p>
<p>愉快的春天呵！</p>
<p>第一眼瞧見西湖，我不禁這樣喊了一聲。</p>
<p>｜｜不吃飯麽？</p>
<p>｜｜游湖去呵！游湖去呵！</p>
<p>把飢餓克服過來，我們五個人一同往湖邊走去。　　湖面是靜的，微微的縐紋緊拖在畫舫的後面；堤上的楊柳在風裏摇曳着，不知道那裏來的一陣花香，使站在湖畔的我有點陶醉了。</p>
<p>呌了隻艇子，五個人全坐了上去。暖和的太陽在我們的頭頂上照耀着，悠悠的湖水在我們的脚下蕩漾着，還有對面的青山，山上的塔像巨人似的站在那裏笑着。艇離了岸就向湖中心划去，輕飄瓢的，我們一時都默不作聲。</p>
<p>划到湖心亭，又划到三潭印月。</p>
<p>｜｜上去看看吧！</p>
<p>我們都聽從了密司Ｘ的話，一齊跳上岸去了。圍在四面的全是湖水：許多小鳥在樹枝頭喧呌着。那裏有許多字和畫，還有杭州特産的蓮粉和藕粉出賣。密司Ｘ買了點掛在手上，便又回到艇上來。</p>
<p>我們都在湖上笑着：心是愉快的，輕鬆的：：：</p>
<p>可是，不知道從什麽時候起，天上的烏雲漸漸加濃起來，太陽光已經隠没了。艇子划到平湖秋月的時候，綫點一樣的雨開始落到我們的身上。</p>
<p>｜｜下雨啦！怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>｜｜躱一躱吧，到上面：：：</p>
<p>｜｜還是划！讓大家打濕一身好了！</p>
<p>是的，雨也止不住我們的遊興，舟子也祗好無可奈何地繼續向湖中划去。</p>
<p>雨的西湖眞另有一番風味！迷濛的，遮着一重霧似的，三潭印月和湖心亭都半藏起它們的面目。過了一會，雨還没有止，蜜司Ｘ手裏的字畫已經全給弄濕了！</p>
<p>｜｜冷嗎？</p>
<p>她問我。</p>
<p>｜｜有一點：：：</p>
<p>直到黃昏，五個人帶着濕淋淋的，疲倦的身子回到旅舍裏，相顧之下，不覺大家失笑了。</p>

<p>女郎多得雲一樣。</p>
<p>雖則多得雲一樣，</p>

<p>她倒呌我快暢。</p>

<p>雖則好得像茶花，</p>
<p>我却不曾想她。</p>
<p>還是白衣絳服，</p>
<p>倒可和她歡洽。</p>
<h3>半天的功課（四）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>聽她這段話，使我想起了事變時讓日本兵抓跑的張先生，一别二年的張先生，不知她到什麽地方去了，像她那樣教導我們的好先生，現在無論如何也找不到了，把她從前説過的話來同校長的話比較一下，眞有天淵之别。什麽呌［新的教育］呢，是管日本人呌大爺麽，老老實實凖備作亡國奴麽？這萬惡的野鷄，她眞是十足的日本奴才！再過幾年，説不定就在這同一學校裏，造出大批大批的順民來，那時的學生們，一定會忘記她們自己原是被壓迫的中華民族的一份子的。</p>
<p>以後她又説些什麽話，我全没有聽進去，可是我單從她第一段的訓話中，就猜得出演稿一定是别人先給她作出來的，不然，就算兩句話，她也不會説得那樣有條理，把字句用得那樣的適當。</p>
<p>不一會工夫，她説完了話，校役抱來好幾束小小的紙國旗，小旗桿只有一尺多長，風吹旗紙花喇花喇地響着。學生每人發下了一面旗。訓育主任又來説話了，等他説完話，我們便由他領導着，整隊出發了。</p>
<p>可是，我却把他那句有趣的話記住了，一面走路一面想着。他那樣的跟同學們説：</p>
<p>［不要以爲開會是玩耍去的，其實就是上課呢！］</p>
<p>不錯，二年來上這樣的功課，記不清有過多少次了，常常因爲來一個日本小官，就會命令我們學生到車站去歡迎，這是新教育中的新功課。</p>
<p>順着蒙古旗胡同，我們的大隊向維新街走着，每人手裏的小旗，都在隨風飄動着，相反的每人的心理，却都死氣沉沉，因此，訓育主任大聲地喊着：</p>
<p>［怎怎都那樣垂頭喪氣的呢？你們想什麽呀？］</p>
<p>隊伍走到新開門街時，一隊學生擋住了去路，這是女子師範學校的學生，和我們一樣，她們每人的手中也都拿着一柄小國旗。街旁看熱閙的人，站的像兩面牆，到這時，就覺得身上有些熱了，不像車上的天氣還有點寒意。</p>
<p>天空中［嗚：：：］地響着，是三架日本飛機從北邊飛到南面去了，隨後，天空中像下雪似地落下一些東西，翻着，飛着，好半天工夫才落到地面上。這是些傳單，中文的和日文的都有。有些孩子們在人叢中擠着搶着，有如拾到什麽寳貝似的。</p>
<p>可憐的窮苦的孩子們，只知道搶着傳單，却不知傳單上印些什麽字。他們更不知自己是作了亡國奴。自然，他們是不必管這些的，他們的父母都是些苦力，每天只知爲生活奔走，只知把肚子塡飽，何嘗有餘暇想一想國家的存亡！他們才不計較這些勾當，有國無國還不是一樣過着貧困的生活，他們的孩子，當然同樣的留意不到國家興亡的事情。</p>

<h3>錢莊業務衰殆</h3>
<p>收解交易兩滯</p>
<p>連日銀行以外商封關後、始於開關日較繁、厥後以市氣不勁、外界不見十分繁榮、終覺放欵爲難、用途不暢、卒至市塲中人跡稀少、人心懈怠、洋拆始終無上落、早午市同爲五分、而劃頭加水亦始終不開、一槪白劃、拆票交易、早市轉賬欵四百二三十萬、新交易七八十萬午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中亦僅四十餘萬、洋押欵交易、目下房産進出稀少、僅持貨物及有價劵抵押、故數額不多、計取贖及新做不過一百三四十萬、鈔票進出一百五十餘萬銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵一百四五十萬、各種貨匯押墊雜欵收解三百零數萬、進倉及出倉軋直、華商銀行收解票欵一百九十餘萬、各種貨匯税押雜欵收解四百二十餘萬、出倉六十萬日商銀行收解票一百七八十萬、各種貨匯雜欵收解二百八十餘萬、出倉四十萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千八百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解六百三十餘萬、各路滙欵三十餘萬、收現八九十萬、客路來源二十萬、去胃僅長江十五萬、又本市票據交换所五日交换總數、銀元八百二十六萬五千三百五十二元三角三分、内計銀元四百九十萬零九千一百六十九元七角七分、滙劃銀元三百三十五萬六千一百八十二元五角六分、</p>
<h3>廣角跌落銅元又縮</h3>
<p>昨日江南小洋、早市及午市均無上落、與前日同價、爲八百三十三元、而交易亦僅早市五千角、午市停頓、廣東小洋似較前日跌小一元一角、計早午市同價、爲七百五十五元七角、做出交易、早市四萬五千角、午市二萬角、銅元縮短二千文、爲三百二十千零五百文、做出交易三萬二千零五十串、計代價洋一萬元、</p>
<h3>證劵美國債劵猛升</h3>
<p>新豐洋行昨日紐約股市云、上落微　、略有參差、蓋財部第四次自由公債之换債計劃仍循正宗途徑、美金因而有力、惟數種股票因特殊關係又破紀錄、低價股票尤形活潑、小交易所市况堅昂、上漲最多者達五元光景、債劵因財部之通告而猛升、美國公債好起半元鐵路債劵高漲數角至三元、又本行紐約代理人報告云、（證劵）呆滯而參差略高、（小麥）白銀膨脹之说甚　塵上、空方乃起補進、市况似將趨高、（棉花）買者之信任心逐漸增强、朋克海案現遇反對、惟此案擁護者預測必有完滿結果、國會中膨脹派繼續活動、交易所案被反對頗烈勢將使此案再行修改、蘇俄之需要仍爲一大潛勢力、現貨清靜、脚地平定、鬆軟時似可購進、全日成交一百五十六萬股、茲將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<h3>紗花沉悶不堪的現紗花</h3>
<p>紗市依然平淡無神、毫無精彩可言、期紗休業無市、市上集會者寥似晨星、惟外棉又見微漲、毫無影響、實以環境不良、實銷太滯、且外商在四方傾銷、使華紗更難插足、查全日各帮買去統計一百九十四包、行情一無變化、各帮買額如下、</p>

<p>棉市因標棉市塲停市、紗銷出路太狹、廠方更無辦意、在此停市之中、棉市消息尤覺沉悶、惟美棉又微漲十磅音云、</p>
<h3>美棉因抵空稍漲</h3>
<p>昨日美棉初因外商賣出而疲、後因布市順利及空户抵補而堅、結果現貨漲五磅音、期貨漲五至七磅音、英棉現貨跌五點、期貨漲一點、埃及棉現貨跌七點、印棉呆滯無特色、平果爾跌一羅比半、奥姆辣跌一羅比七角半、白羅溪跌半羅比、原電錄左、（四日電）</p>

<h3>糧食滬南米市無榮辱</h3>
<p>滬北昨未開斛</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源較稀、計共二十餘號、（三千餘石）銷塲方面、以天雨另　兩胃均見懈、形勢清寂、市况定局、本街所去常帮蘇同南　等粳價俱無榮辱、而青角松泗西練等晚稻、雖包胃續動、然如北洋帮納意不淡、僅採一千四五百包、行情猶難提升、居守老盤、杜羊尖以去路轉呆、略帶軟色、而價尚無上落、陰變元供求俱稀、尚無軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日各埠到貨甚稀、祇十餘號、市銷因斛師酒資糾紛、尚未解决、又值清明假節、去　清淡、賣買方均未上市、斛師問題、諒不日卽可解决、銷胃必好、昨日無市、</p>
<h3>黃豆銷路懈怠續跌</h3>
<p>生仁做開二千包</p>
<p>昨日黃豆市况依然下游、來源接而不湧、去路廠胃亦淡、人心浮動、行情續跌二三分、前途恐仍辱多而榮少也、昨計成交正陽關豆二百包、由本街出口採去、歸德豆開二車、爲内地本街分去、頴州豆開三百五十包、及肥河豆四百包、俱爲本街辦去、尚有大連四平街豆一百包、聞由内地取去、生仁市一度得産價報漲而提升後、因粤銷非賤不取、市面依然回疲、聞前晚有二批做開、計開　山貨千餘包、價爲三元五角半、及　州貨九百餘包、價三元四角半云、</p>
<h3>高機晚米已開八元一角</h3>
<p>湘米近有少數到申</p>
<p>昨日客秈到存兩少、各化活潑、繼續上展、高江西機晚米昨大至八元一角、湖南及其他高貨均被産地貨主限價、不允賤脱、惟中關湘米近日略有裝到、數亦不多、且一部份亦係限價出售、因此交易未能旺暢、全日由福州辦去機晚三百五十包、機砶靖米三百九十四包、沙市糙米二百十五包、蕪湖機秈三百八十包、高貨如機晚米漲近角、其他中次各擋一律續大五分至七八分不等、本街以客秈昂未有問訊、祇辦小絞一千色價仍八元七角半云、</p>
<h3>糖市太古糖上檔步緊</h3>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢尚屬平穏、進出依然不盛、公會划盤二四粗砂白普通十九元八角半本棧貨十九元九角半、轉口貨六元六角七分、均少變動、八九號荷赤亦乏走化、太古糖Ｂ　呌升五分、爲二十元三角、其次如ＣＷ　十九元九角半、ＤＹ　十九元七角、ＨＸ　十九元四角五分、均有做出、本廠綿白振記一號、十八元四角、金心一號同價、仁記一號十八元三角、其餘二三四號照退、號盤僅枝洋稍有開出、價爲十四元七角半、無甚上　、海南赤銷路有活動形勢、號盤未鬆、</p>
<h3>南北貨龍口粉新貨將到</h3>
<p>市價步鬆</p>
<p>龍口綫粉干、邇來銷路呆滯、兼之新貨不久將到、市勢步見下游、客貨開價亦鬆、比前已步降元許、而走塲仍未暢、昨聞地價劃申較宜、市勢更難轉機、行盤正牌奸貨十七元半、次之十七元趨勢平疲、</p>
<h3>油市白桐油漢市又漲</h3>
<p>白桐油漢市連日洋莊交易不絶、而來源仍屬稀少、致市面益形緊俏、自洋行箱進二十五元後、昨日電傳已售開二十五元七角、且形勢尚緊有繼續增加之可能、按漢市洋莊桐油、近年來免起鶻落、時有所見、惟漲時甚速、跌落亦易、獨此次情形與往時稍有不同、蓋漲勢並不激烈、由漸而進、故較暴漲之根本、似見穏固、非若漲速而跌亦易可相提並論也、不過市已漲至此步、欲希望其再有飛黃騰達、似屬不易、而小數增加、則已可槪見根本旣固、欲其回小、總非易事也、聞漢行開進客貨、襄桐在二十一元左右、南支二十元零七八角、來數不多、無大票可進、浙桐附和漢桐、亦漸加增、據昨日消息、杭行售送由須每砠二十一元四角、金蘭各産地亦已見漲、故其漲風尚方興未艾也、本埠近來有少數洋莊交易、係某豆米行家兼做、大槪數十噸生意而已、觀其進貨、當可槪見也、桐油號家、雖有一二家做洋莊貨、近來亦稍有售出、惟其數更少、内銷仍屬零落、故各號家對於進貨、雖有漢市之漲風、而依然未能踴躍也、</p>
<h3>絲茶華絲外銷不動</h3>
<p>紐約生絲銷用鋭减紐約絲織廠、因世界經濟恐慌、絲織品銷路呆滯、絲綢存底充厚、故均　工停機、生絲銷用鋭减、日昨美絲　　得紐約絲市電報、上月（卽三月）份紐约全市絲織廠共祇銷用生絲二萬八千三百九十四包、祗及往歳各月十分之五云、</p>
<p>輯里乾經美銷告絶浙湖所産之優等輯里乾經、盛銷美屬、近年來因摇製不良、已被日絲侵銷殆盡、紐約市塲輯里乾經已告絶跡、今歳三個月中、竟無乾經運美、最近祇有湖州白土絲三包、　往西雅圖聞係新絲樣品云、</p>
<p>洋莊絲市無生氣海外生絲市塲存絲充厚、銷費日减、里昂等處實銷不動、紐约絲價恐難立住、進口商手中存絲求售心切、滬埠廠經去電不轉、洋莊絲市仍無生氣、昨祇達昌等補進黃廠經十包、灰經五包、價仍不振、</p>

<h3>談言</h3>
<h3>關於囚犯的性慾問題</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>前天各報都競載着一則新鮮的新聞：［一日路透社電：廣州南雄當局，近接被判處長期徒刑囚犯等之呈文，要求當局准許各犯之眷屬，按時入獄同居，俾傳後代。呈文中復引用孔子［不孝有三，無後爲大］一語：聞當局已擬駁斥此項要求，認爲中國司法制度上，並無囚犯之妻可以入獄與夫同居之規定：：］云。</p>
<p>這一段新聞眞是新頴之極，奇怪之至。吾不知道文明各國，是否已有囚犯之妻，可以按期入獄與夫同居之明文規定嗎？如果眞有這樣事實話，那麽，吾想司法當局在建築監獄之外，更應建築若干間密室，以便使那些囚犯之妻，可以按期入獄與夫同居，俾可傳宗接代，的是功德無量，好生之德。</p>
<p>在呈文中引孔子［不孝有三，無後爲大］一語作爲標榜，吾想他們倒不愧爲［讀過孔子之書］，［達過周公之禮］的。的確，他們身雖處於囹圄，而猶孜孜不忘傳宗接代。可見得他們確實是一個偉大的孝子（？）：可敬，可敬！不過孔老夫子说出這話時，有没有替囚犯們設想及此：不然者，則吾不禁爲他老人家呼寃喊屈了。然而，吾又想到那些没有娶妻的囚犯們，又得用什麽方法來傳宗接代呢？這倒是一個重大的問題。</p>
<p>在許久以前吧！吾還記得羅文幹氏，曾發表過一次關於解放囚犯性慾的問題的意見。當時也曾引起各報的騰載：他已將本問題的大意，動機，呈請行政院批准，擬先將内地監獄試行，俟認爲確無任何弊　發生時，再行推行全國。［凡被判長期徒刑之囚犯，調查其確有夫妻關係者，得於規定期間内入獄同居。］自這消息發出以後，一般輿論界都有訾議。理由是囚犯的行爲惡劣，其不良之遺傳性的傳染，卽使受胎，亦無良好的種族。且當時雙方亦均在憂鬱悲苦的環境中，其思想未必會有愉快的表現。將來影響種族前途，實非淺鮮。而他們的眷屬願否入獄和他同居，還是屬於另一問題，可是時間的侷促，也是不能避免的事實。</p>
<p>後來，羅氏這一個建議，終没給行政院批准，於是，無形中烟消雲散，頓成泡影，久而久之，大家也已把這椿事情漸漸淡忘了。現在廣州的獄犯，居然會上起這樣地一件呈文來，眞可謂響應了羅氏的倡議。但不幸得很，却給廣州當局大加駁斥；這不啻一勺冷水從猛頭頂澆了下來，把他們滿懷的熱望都澆得冰冷。</p>
<p>但是，吾也聽得日本的法律制度上，的確有這樣一個事實。凡囚犯之被判有一年以上的徒刑者，他的眷屬每星期可至指定的密室裏與夫幽會一次的。但，倒底不知是否是事實嗎？</p>
<h3>我的故鄉</h3>
<p>— 乃碩</p>
<p>我的故鄉，不是湘鄉，而是小小的永豐。</p>
<p>在产曾湘鄉的盛名掩護下的湘鄉縣城，却老遠是那麽荒凉，冷落，櫛比的市房，不過是商民的寓宅罷了，怎樣也烘托不出一個商業城市的輪廊。永豐呢，雖然是那麽小小的一個市鎭，却有着雄厚的商業勢力，水有舟楫之便，陸上又有汽車飛奔，更扼着軍事上的要衝。雖然市房不多｜｜相當於江灣鎭，但他的實質却要勝過十倍呢。</p>
<p>恰是十年前的初秋，我由三十里外的隣鎭，投進這永豐的一所高小肄業了。説到這高小，它非但不像上海的一樓一底甚至僅有一亭子間的小學，簡直是要勝過上海的一般中學，它有着寛敝的校舍，它有着數百畝地的基金。臨江對峙的女子職業學校，是那麽的神秘呵！她們的勢力，眞是所届無疆，還記得當年我們的男學校裏是有着這樣的禁令：［傍晚學生外出散步，不得逗留女校對岸。］説到我們那高小，倒曾教育出過不少的人物。</p>
<p>當代許多革命的大將，都曾蒞止過，留　過我們的永豐，撒下過無數的革命種子。我們更曾親身迎陣，　食　漿。攀過將軍們的行輿，領會過那麽親善的點首笑語。我們更曾瘋狂似的滿街宣傳。憶當年，聖潔的心，只有希望革命成功的幻想呵！</p>
<p>那兒的商業是有着驚人的繁盛，貨積如山的南號，江西帮的大藥房，有轉運公司。那兒是遠近各處的土貨的集中點，也是消納外貨的消散地。天亮了，市民便滿街的擁擠着，有如一框蜂羣。夜深了，除了更夫的擊朴聲外，還能在清切的枕邊，細細地領會那圍鼓戲的夜的巡禮。不曾有過什麽饑荒，也就不知道什麽呌做不景氣。</p>
<p>比譬來説，它好像是一個滿懷聖潔的誠樸村女，只見蓬勃的生的喜悦，没有沈沈的暮氛。</p>
<p>這是十年前的情景。</p>
<p>也就成了十年前的情景，是往事了喲！</p>
<p>而今呢，眞是［不堪回首話當年］！去年我曾回去，一路上我只懷蓄着興奮的心情，那知見面之後，竟是那麽的使人驚訝呀！</p>
<p>一個熱烘烘的閙市，竟成了荒凉凄清的市墟，原有的商號，雖説還在勉强維持，可是誰都到了没落的尖端。</p>
<p>街頭只見狗兒困鬭，屋頂是烏鵲噪呌的所在。十年前的繁盛，已不知隠消到何方去了。</p>
<p>新有的是每當汽車駛進站來，多出了成羣的小販呌嚷，多出了幾家不中不西的旅館，棧房，多出了一批西裝少年在街頭閒逛。</p>
<p>最近我更連接了好幾個故鄉的音訊，都説它已成了像就木的老嫗。</p>
<p>最近我更邂逅着若干新從故鄉逃跑出來的鄉親，一會着面，一談及永豐，大家便只有摇頭，他們並不談什麽農村衰落，市面不景氣，只是異口同聲的説：</p>
<p>［一届兵荒一届災，故鄉是不堪聞問了！］</p>
<h3>白堤晚歸</h3>
<p>— 青木</p>
<p>一輪處女般的嬌日，已很怕羞似的隠到那邊峯　之下了。一片片富於曲綫美的五彩雲霞，也好像熱望求偶着的去尋覓她們的歸宿。那時候，白堤上蹂滿了芳艶的足跡，一對一對紅男綠女，才子佳人，都携着手在堤畔柳蔭之下，柔語蜜談。湖中狡獪的遊魚，也效學了他們交頭接耳的徘徊，依戀不捨，眞羨殺了我們單身漢。</p>
<p>一般老太太香客們，懸了黃色的香袋，經過這美的清秀的長堤從靈隠天竺進香回來，祈禱她們多福多壽，修子修孫。我孤零的遊覽着這堤上的勝境，放鶴亭，平湖秋月，西冷印社，反增添了我不少愁思。這本是騷客隠士品茗吟詩之所，現在呢，人頭濟濟，俗氣難堪，彷彿海上的茶肆！牠們本足以爲湖山生色，現在反變爲　蛇添足。</p>
<p>月亮漸漸的高起來，這就是暗示我歸去的記號。今天没有多走這麽路，這時候已感到疲乏和勞頓，多不中用呵。明天要絶早起身到望陽台上遠眺錢江日出的美景，雖然明天還有明天的機會，不過我們人生那裏有希望未來的可能，除了那時已到了我們的眼前。</p>
<p>在不經意的當兒，忽從昨天緊閉着的我們房間對面的客舍裏發出纏綿的聲浪促進我的耳鼓。不知有什麽魔力似的引起我的注意，我居高臨下的從窗隙中望去，不過很模糊的幻境似的現象印進我的眼簾，好像一對天使似的愛人，正在擁抱着緊緊的Ｋiss。我從他們外觀上的動作，恐怕不是一對正式的鴛鴦吧？這樣的熱情，恐怕也要羡殺那邊佛殿上的菩薩，何况我們單身漢：不過我已知道愛情，現在黃金可以買得到的愛情！</p>
<p>呵，愛情，勸你休講愛情！</p>
<p>你囊中可有滿滿的黃金？</p>
<p>倘若你還是個窮措大，</p>
<p>就勸你别向盈盈的調情！</p>
<h3>申報流通圖書館閲書記</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>申報流通圖書館創設於南京路大陸商塲三樓，雖開辦只有一年餘，成績却甚有可觀。這里因爲地點適中，交通便利，故每天到館借書或閲讀雜誌報章者，異常擁擠。我的住宅雖　此地很遠，但每逢有事外出，或無聊時去逛馬路，總習慣地要到館裏跑一趟，隨便翻幾頁雜誌或報紙看看，前星期三下午，還特地［光臨］來消磨了大半天的工夫。</p>
<p>由入口處領了一塊銅牌，我從書架上選取一册東方雜誌，就在閲書室内的一個空位子坐定了。未翻書看之先，我抬起頭向四面望一望，今天約莫有二十多位的讀者。有學生模樣的，有職業界中人，又有類似工人裝束者。［萬綠叢中一點紅］，凑巧在許多男人中，有一位小姐參雜其間。他們或坐，或立，或看雜誌，或讀報紙，一對對的眼睛，各凝注着排在桌上或執在手中的書卷，好像在找尋着什麽秘密似的。</p>
<p>我讀完了兩篇我所要讀的文章之後，想再去找一本我所要看的文學，可是不見了，已經被捷足者先取了去，於是我便到借書處去塡張借書單，希望借一二卷社會科學之類的東西來讀，豈料一連寫了四種書目，都没有借到。不得已，只好去翻閲日報，少頃，又借了一册中國大觀來看。閲書室里一會兒去了幾個人，一會兒又來了幾個人，來的比去的多一些。</p>
<p>時間已是五點二十五分了，我精神感到疲困，便交還了銅牌，踏出閲書室。此刻窗口外尚站立着許多人在等候着借書，館里的辦事員顯着十分的忙碌</p>
<p>在電梯中，我的腦里偶然湧現出一種疑問：這些人有空爲什麽不到遊藝塲去玩個痛快，偏要到這里來枯坐沉思，向着書卷發呆？哦！知道了，原來人類的生活，除了物質上的供養，還需要精神上的食量。精神上的飢餓，也同肚子里的空虚一樣難過。而圖書館是個供給［精神食量］的地方，怪不得無數有求知慾的人們都喜歡向這里跑，盼望由這里得到了多少精神上的滿足。</p>
<p>申報流通圖書館這個［公共精神食堂，］是申報誕生六十年所舉辦的一種社會事業。這個［食堂］是在供給一班精神飢荒者以營養料，於大衆是非常有益的。我們希望牠能一天天地擴大發展起來，把各色各樣的［珍　異饌，美酒佳餚，］備置豐盛，以便饗宴一般［飢渴者，］使社會人士不致感到有精神凍餒之虞，則造福文化不淺矣！</p>

<h3>談女子體育</h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>數千年來，女子困於陳腐的傳統習尚裏，除了深深的被囚在家庭，作奴隸和牛馬之外，一切自身急待解决的事業，都没有法子創造和開拓，那裏還有餘暇，去講求體育這個她們認爲額外的問題，和實地去練習一下的機會喲？因爲那時深嚴的封建思想，束缚着她們各自的腦筋，除了一部份女子，簡直不知道有這個名稱之外，有的也只認爲這不是女子本身所能享受得到的。似乎當時的社會制度，已經注定了女子這種命運，她們獲得到這種權利，不算是不幸，而且認爲是天經地義的理由；女子只能朝暮深處閨房中，做男人的牛馬和奴隸！</p>
<p>歐風東漸，經過了幾次婦女運動的打擊，而舊的制度漸漸隨着這種狂瀾而崩流，一切新的現象隨之勃興：女子體育，提倡女子體育的呼聲，因此日加響應了！以前所被視爲的［東方病婦］［病態美人］：：：男子對女子等等惡劣的稱呼，也因此改頭换面來一個什麽，須要健康美的名稱了。在客觀的事實上，我們當然不能否認，女子體育年來有驚人的進步！在各省各縣，都相繼發起女子體育競賽會，將數千年囚藏在黑暗地獄裏的女同胞們，都先後提拔到戰塲上來，顯示各人的本領，尤其是費去若干萬資本的去年偌大堂皇的全國運動會，在南京建築起莊嚴巍然的運動塲，各省都選出那樣多驚人的女英雄到塲表演，我們更不能否認，女子體育的進步一般事實的證明。這次鬥智鬥勇，心力交悴的萬國女籃球，果以三十四比二十七擊敗英國，奪回本埠萬國女子錦標，不落碧眼之手，實堪聊快人心。這種驚天的進步，在目前民氣衰頽達於極點的狀態下，不能不説是一種新生的現象；尤其是對於剛在萌芽的女子體育前途，是如何慶幸的一回事啊？</p>
<p>社會組織不良的結果，一切現象却畸形化，病態化的當中，雖然上面说了一些女子體育發展，進步的事實，然而我們仔細一看，還有多少地方，學校，尚待這種設施呵！所以女子體育，雖然有着一些成績出現，然而並没有進展到各個地方，普遍到一般受壓迫的女子身上去：</p>
<p>藝術是恢復人們的疲乏的優美現象；同樣的，體育亦是以强健身體爲目的，目前因爲基於一般制度組織的不健全，所以體育，没有健全到每一個人身上去，而只是畸形化，部份化了。尤其是女子體育，更是一個很明顯的事實。</p>
<p>在各個距城市不遠的，許多鄉村裏面，我們不是常常可以看見，數千年來被傳統下來的一些失去了天足的女子們，不仍然在那兒痛苦着，患着這種遺傳病麽？因此，我們知道所謂女子體育的發展，也不過只是在都市裏面，一部份人係摩登口號和裝飾品罷了。</p>
<p>提倡體育，我們是絶對應該的，尤其是女子體育，是刻不容緩的，須待振作呵！今後我們該怎樣來普及女子體育，使被壓迫的，數千年困囚在牢獄似的婦女們，都享受到這種權利，而走上健康的路！</p>

<p>女人自然是爲男子而生下來的，而男子也决少不了女人這東西。兩者的關係卽使小孩子亦莫不通曉，故母須多嘴。女人之存在猶如影之隨身，怎樣也不能分開的。世界上如果没有女人的點綴，卽將變成沙漠的荒凉。不但男人活不成，人類也老早完了。所以一談起女人，一瞧見女人，你總要情不自禁地眉開眼笑，無端而興奮，除非你是一塊無感覺的木頭不説。眞的女人是生命的源泉，比柴米更要緊的糧食，世界少了她便不成爲其世界，女人之効用魔力都令人不可思議。女人的一顰一笑莫不價值千金，但其禍害也往往由此而生，所謂有利必有弊。時常爲了那輕輕的一顰一笑，使得你神魂顚倒，什麽天大的事都抛向九宵雲外，卽是身亡家破也在所不顧，甚而至於［一顧傾入城，再顧傾入國］也有之，歷史上許多昏庸的君王都爲了區區一女兒身而致國亡滅種者不知有多少，一些人常常只覺得［豔色天下重］，把女人四脚四肘抬上雲端，自己甘願作柘榴裙下的牛馬奴隸，死心塌地耽樂於美人窩中。而未曾一想及女人害人的厲害可怕，明知是飲酖止渴，還是漠然的飲下去，的死不悟。卽是被女人害得支離破碎，凄凉苦楚，但仍是不加悔恨，依舊崇拜之，追逐之，俸之爲神聖尊嚴的聖物。這眞是可哭之至。</p>
<p>女人固然是非常需要，但必要加以相當的輕蔑，不可把她看得那末神秘，那末高貴，使她們多所反省，不敢忘自傲岸矜持，自以爲了不起的人物。因爲你若太看重，她們就會目空一切，而當你做牛馬騎着。况你是人，難道願以昂昂然七尺之軀爲之牛馬，不感到可恥麽？</p>
<p>女人這東西確是天生尤物，益人不足，害人有餘，旣然少不得，而又多不得，實在有點像鷄肋，食之無味，棄之可惜。她們頂會妖妖冶冶，你如果太過體貼客氣，他會得居然爬上你的腦袋上溺糞。當然，我並不絶對詆毁女人，我向來守身如玉，不學狂蜂浪蝶的奔逐，故不曾上了女人的當，更没有資格談到失戀，所以我之與女人，可説是無仇無怨，無憎也無愛·不過時常看見一班人侍奉女人幾有如待奉其祖宗父母，大有［萬般皆下品，惟有女人好］之慨，極盡委曲受辱之能事，耳聞目擊，中心有無限的感嘆·人心不古，江河日下，恐至此爲極吧我實在看不慣，因此來做些反面文章，使［只知有女人不知有其他的唯女人主義的人們不要那樣混帳一生，糊裏糊塗做女人的犠牲品，遺臭萬年。女人固然重要，但也要記住女人能够呌人身敗名裂，死無葬身之地的。對於此，如能細加深味，則其中有大道理在，且可以獲益無窮，而使你改變一向對女人的不正當的敬重觀念。</p>

<h3>業餘信箱</h3>
<h3>從花柳病談到青年的性煩悶</h3>
<p>｜編者的話｜</p>
<p>討論這個問題的信，已發表了三封，其餘的來函因爲意思都差不多，不擬再登載了。而且，這個討論已有一個多星期，讀者就是不厭倦，恐怕也是急待着编者［老着臉］下的結論吧！説來也很慚愧，我老着臉想説的话，現在已不敢老着臉説了，有點害羞了，爲的是這個問題要是大家不感到苦悶，處世和性的苦悶，就是苦悶也不從縱慾方面去謀發洩呢，解决又是很容易的，但若苦悶是不能免除，性的要求入無合理的解决，那就難了。所以編者從前對於這個問題的見解，雖則現在自己尚未以爲非，但究竟能否使青年不再去蹈這種危險。却又有點不敢自信，爲什麽呢？因爲這個問題不是一個獨立問題，乃是現社會上社會紛亂，一般人生活痛苦等等原因的促成，亦卽長現社會制度之缺陷之反映，所以它的合理解决是要在整個社會問題解决之後，换句話説，整個社會問題一解决，這是根本不成問題的。</p>
<p>何以這問題與整個社會問題有關呢？理由是這樣的：花柳病的起因是［嫖妓］。（就一般言）但是爲什麽要嫖呢？那就有兩種情形，一種人是飽食終日，無所事事，閒着難過，又不能把光陰消費到事業，正當娱樂之上，於是［吃，喝，嫖賭］樣樣都來：另外一種人則因年齡已到了或者超過了青春期，性的需要已感到十分迫切，但在經濟上又不允許他結婚，或者有了妻子，但不能同居，把性慾給以合理的滿足，於是明知嫖是不名譽的，是有危險的，也祇好不顧一切，飲酖止渴，冒險去做這種勾當。前一種人並非起因於性慾苦悶，雖然他們的胡調也是由於環境之驅使，究竟自己不好，因此編者並不爲他們着想，在本文所討論的對象，祗是後者的情形。</p>
<p>現在先説性慾的煩悶，是否一個人因爲性的衝動就非滿足不可。在編者以爲，這是不一定的。固然性慾是人類的天性，人類非有以相當的滿足不可，然而人的迫切的慾望或要求並不祗性慾一種，就如［食色性也］這一句話，也還要以食冠頭，由此可知性慾的要求並非一個人要求的全部。而且，人類的慾望是有等级的人類之滿足慾望，必儘先滿足最主要的以後再逐漸及於重要的，次要的，等等，［這是經濟學上心理學派對於慾望的解釋，從心理學上講，這是對的，但若以之應用到經濟學上却就錯了，不過那是另一回事，我們不必追究也。）俗諺所説的［飽暖思淫慾，飢寒起盜心］亦是此理，所以像我們一般窮困的大衆，旣因生活艱難而娶不了妻，不能合理的解决性慾，則無寗把他的精神，心力統統不要放在解决性慾上，而轉移到謀生活之改善，經濟之解放等等奮鬥上去。而且在心理學上又有所謂轉移原則，就是一個人在某方面不得已了，不能進取了，他是可把精神努力放到别一方面去謀發展的。編者從前在大學讀書時就有過這樣一個經騐，就是凡是面貌醜陋，經濟又不大充裕的男女同學，在學問上大都要努力些，用功些。因爲他們不能以色相，經濟條件上出風頭，不得已不另謀出路，找露臉辦法也。所以，編者雖不像一般禁慾主義者那樣忽視性慾之重要，但却主張一般不能合理的解决性慾者因其不能解决，索性不解决，而做些有效的工作，能够達到目的的事。想來這旣不違反人類的天性，未必就不能見諸實行罷！</p>
<p>其次，我們再説到社會的原因。有許多人因爲境遇之蹇舛，處世之苦悶，和生活之窮困，又想不出改善的辦法，奮鬥的途徑，於是索性一切不管，抱着信陵君醇酒婦人態度，盡情去享樂，荒唐。更因性的衝動，荒唐的行爲大都是色情的追求。我們看到親身經歷過花柳病痛苦的鐘戴二君，都是把生活的苦悶，和處世的艱險看得很重要，就可知［嫖］之主因不單是［性的要求］，或許竟是社會的原因是主因，而［性的要求］不過一種誘質而已，因爲性的要求不過是［要嫖］的動機，而那種自暴自棄心理纔是［去嫖］的决心也。所以我們對於這一層實應大大注意：不過這就社會一般講，説社會上［嫖］或［淫風］之盛行，花柳病之蔓延，不是［世風不古］［人心大壞］而是另有客觀原因，是可以的，若個人拿這種原因來做幌子，用以自恕，却是萬萬不可。因爲社會制度的不良，生活的痛苦，爲青年墮落之原因，誠然是不錯，但是擺在我們面前正有出路在，正有我們解除這些鎖鍊的奮鬥方針在，我們不但用不着消極，頽廢，而且消極頽廢，根本祗是一種［慢性的殺，］决不能因此减少環境的痛苦，反而要增加，至使你不克忍受（關於消極頽廢，當别作討論，茲不多説）所以青年因此而縱情聲色者，是他自己不好，爲我們所不能寛容的事。</p>
<p>總之，編者所欲爲一般青年告的一句話是：性的衝動或煩悶是不能爲害的，祗有自己的不能振作，纔是使你踏上危機的主因。</p>
<p>末了，編者對於來信討論的諸君，深爲感佩；他們能够把自身所感受的痛苦誠懇地告訴讀者，他們能以服務精神貢獻辦法，凡此均是現在社會中難能可貴的精神與態度。編者</p>

<h3>暹羅漫譚（五）</h3>
<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>不做和尚没有老婆</p>
<p>在我國，做和尚原是最可憐不過的。除了少數看破紅塵自己願意出家的人外，大多數是因爲家境貧苦自小被父母送到廟裏去，硬呌他度那没有人生樂趣的歳月，這確是似乎不很人道。偶然有一二個受不住生理壓迫，不得已做些偷雞摸狗的事，社會就要責他不守清規，甚至要受法律的制裁。可是在暹羅却不然：非特和尚可以生男養女，而且不做和尚還没有資格娶妻。所以全國人民，没有一個不要做一次和尚，就是貴爲國王，也要剃掉了頭髮，在廟裏住上這麽一月兩月。不過，不願還俗的僧人，也是很多的。這原因，並不是他們鄙棄情慾，摒絶塵緣。原來暹羅是佛教國，僧人的地位比平民要高貴得多。同時寺院裏，又都有着巨大的廟產，可以供他們揮霍。而且雖不娶妻，性的問題一樣可以半公開的解决。因此，只會消費不事生産的暹羅和尚，也就一天天的多起來了。</p>
<p>每當早晨五六點鐘的時候，我們無論在那一條街道上，都可以看到身褒黃綾手托鐵鉢的和尚們，一個個目不旁視的疾行着，這就是他們每天照律要舉行一次的募化了。善男信女　　見和尚來了，連忙跑在他面前，把凖備好的白米，香　，椰子，或　　等食物，雙手獻上，如果和尚肯用鐵鉢來受領你的話，你還得向他合掌叩謝。還有更奇的，就是每個和尚出門，後面必定有一個年青的　從跟隨，有太陽替他掌傘，買東西替他提包。眞是　氣作凡！若以我國的和尚來和他們比較一下，其　　實在是不可以這里計了。</p>

<h3>一個死而復生的人陳述渡入永生的滋味</h3>
<p>— 奚冷</p>
<p>愛德華魯濱生的經騐</p>
<p>可作科學參考之資料</p>
<p>死的感覺是怎樣的？它有什麽知覺？一個人當那黑幕漸漸遮蓋起他知覺的窗　的一霎那間，有什麽思想？有什麽反動？敢説我們中間，很少人有這種經騐的。但是愛德華魯濱生（ＥdwardＧＲobinoon），却有過這種經騐，而現在</p>
<p>還能够來和我們談話。他是死而復生的人，死得完全和屍體一樣，但是居然又救了回來，來和我們談话，一個人當走進了第二世界的邊境的時候，到底有什麽反響。這當然是千載難遇的奇事。</p>
<p>説魯濱生死而復生，這並不是什麽無稽荒誕的事情。他是淹死的。他的心都不跳了。他確已到了［死亡之谷］了。他的身體裏，已没了０一絲的生氣。醫生都説他是已經過世的了。總而言之，他已不復在人間世上了。但是後來用了人工的方法，將他肺裏盛滿的水掀了出來，將他已停止的心撥動起來，將他腦筋裏的知覺恢復過來。那時他還不過是個小孩子，但他直到現在還記得清清楚楚，每一個思想，每一個反動，在那度入永生的幾分鐘之内。</p>
<p>他那時候還在紐約的市立中學的附屬小學讀書。那時附屬小學的學生，可以在一定鐘點之内，在中學的運動室裏游泳的。愛德華因爲學習游泳過於起勁的緣故，所以竟超過了那規定的鐘點。有一位游泳教習，因爲要使他記住不要超過規定鐘點起見，就想用方法，懲治他一下。［那個時候］，愛德華説，［我剛吐完一口氣，正要吸進養氣的時候，我的兩只脚突然被人拉住了，拖到水面之下。這樣一來，咕嘟一下，他的肺裏都裝滿了水了。那一時窒息的恐恢，瘋狂的掙扎，要想透出水面，得些空氣，但是没有氣力了。在這個當然，我知道我要淹死了。那個教習，亦不理會他做了一件什麽事，很得意地游到一邊，等我自己上來。但是我没有上來。直等到我不掙扎了，我躺在池底不動了，他們才知道我是淹死了。］</p>
<p>於是他們慌忙地將他搬上來。那時候他們知道已是來不及了，因爲脈息已没有，呼吸已全停，心房亦不跳動了。他們急速召了一個醫生來，他説愛德華已死了，但是爲萬一起見，他吩咐用人工呼吸法來試试。他們於是這樣施用着人工呼吸法，差不多過了一個鐘頭，還是没有動靜。他們以爲是實在無望的了。忽然他的脈息有些跳動了。再一回兒，他的肺居然吸進了一些比世上一切還要貴重的空氣。這樣，他已入幽冥的靈魂，又回到陽世來了。（未完）</p>
<h3>影片談評</h3>
<h3>评［風］</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>｜金城映｜</p>
<p>［風］，被聯華影片公司當作超特作品宣傳着，因此使我們很關心而熱烈的期望着。</p>
<p>的確，［風］是值得注意的，不管是作者的意識形態，或是作者的表現方法，都使我們對於這位新進導演吳村先生懷着絶大的關切。正因爲如此，我們爲了愛護一個前進的作家，對於他的作品是不敢絲毫忽視的，也就是説，我們將率直的批評他的作品任何方面，使他在我們的意見之中知道我們的要求。這樣，想必然的爲作者開誠接受，因爲我們認定他是一個能够容納别人意見的人。</p>
<p>這是很明顯的事實，我們在［風］中可看出作者懷着巨大的熱情。他對於上層階級十分怨恨，他對於下層階級有着充分的同情。然而他自己旣不屬上層階級，也不屬於貧窮者之羣，他到底是一個中間階層覺悟的知識份子。於是，以他自己的生活和環境之意識的决定，他對於自己所怨恨者只能予以輕微的譏諷，同時對於勞苦羣衆也祗能給與善意的同情而已。</p>
<p>到底，作者因着生活的範圍，他對於上層社會没有機會去深切的了解，同樣，他對於下層社會也不肯找機會去進一步的理解，於是他只是憑着自己的聰明去想像揣摩。因此，卽使他熱情的將自身的一切希望都寄放在勞苦大衆身上，然而他不能更眞實的表現出來。何况，他不能放棄小布爾喬亞作者之詩的心境，於是在需要極端堅强的手法來處理毁滅與建設之偉大課題的時候，他所能做到的祗是對於正在崩潰着的醜惡加以浮面的暴露或譏諷，而對於另一方面也不能找住他的重心來發揚光大。説得更明白一點，他雙方面都没有抓住其眞實性，他僅是將自己的幻想展開，内容空虚的詩，便是他的電影作品。</p>
<p>很明顯的，他用着象徵的手法來創作電影，暴風雨的謳歌，成爲他作品主要的重心。王桂林所飾的醉鬼，殷秀岑所飾的大塊頭，高占非所飾海員工人，以及談瑛所飾的花瓶，差不多都是全部幻想的人物。王明的［秉燭夜游］，小明的剪碎妹妹的衣服，紳士殷先生的夜間撑雨傘等等，在作者也許都有深重的含義，然而在我們却以爲都是瘋人的行動。我們所要求的是社會的眞實，更要求着［比眞實更眞實］的表现方法。至於少珍的自迷惑至［覺悟］，雖然她的過程相當自然，但是那也祗是極少數的現象罷。而且她的所謂［覺悟］也是很值得考慮的。</p>
<p>我們在影片中看不到兩個階級之間的利害衝突，我們不了解扣留違禁品的原因和結果，這些，固然是作者對於社會現象没有更進一步的了解，而另一方面也是作者表現技巧的不够。</p>
<p>關於這一方面，我們不妨再具體的提出幾點意見，大槪是作者還是新手的原故，對於畫面的剪接還不够成就，這應當是［風］的主要缺點，重複，故事展開的過程，不够簡潔明白。前者可以小珍躱在假山後和殷绅士的在石洞中退不出來爲例，後者是通常的毛病。特别是暴風雨的前後，他要同時三緊張的描寫，寫夜園會，貨棧門口，還寫王明父子，這種塲面是極不容易處理的，顧此失彼，很不易於緊張。事實上他顧及了夜園會的緊凑，而貨棧門口便失了時間的Ｍontage了。總之，自首至尾不能給與我們明快的感覺。雖然我們並不致於看不懂，然而因着編輯的零亂以致於失了一貫嚴肅的感情，却是作品無可賠償的損失了。所以，假使認爲本片没有感情的話，除了一方面因着不够眞實的原因之外，而作者缺乏Ｍontage的研究，亦是主要的失敗原因。</p>
<p>但是，作者的聰明，却是不可磨滅的事實。諸如畫面的美麗，每一個人物動作的美化，以及每一個塲面的支配，都可看出前途有着極大的希望。當然，在這中間，我們决不會忽視攝影的成功，以及佈景的偉大。</p>
<p>不過，小缺點也是我們所當指出的，如有好些人物都是同樣的以扇或報紙請帖自臉上移下露出面部，使人感覺煩膩，如無味的噱頭之處理，如經理在寡婦家樓梯上臨走時談着解釋誤會之不合理，如好些對話不够流利或字的錯誤，如小珍兩次在屏風後出來，以及第一次肉感的照鏡時之時間的不合理，如小珍在經理和寡婦身旁竊聽而居然不給他們看見，如暴風雨之後有不少人點着燈籠，如最後王明父子三人之大寫，不爲一般觀衆所理解等等，都是值得提出研究的地方。還有船主淋着酒在王明頭上，因爲没有淋下來的畫面，也是给人誤會的，這大槪被剪掉了的。</p>
<p>我們相信，這部影片一定多少被剪，以致零亂。更明顯的是作者過於顧及了環境，以致不能暢所欲言。關於這一點，我們自然可以對作者大爲原諒，然而同時對於觀衆對社會也要負責的啊！</p>
<p>最後，我們得説到一些演員的演技。我們得以極大的驚奇，當我們看到了談瑛的成績之後。她有着嘉寳的神秘性，同時還有可愛的活潑姿態。我們希望她在這一方面多多努力。高占非因着劇本的限制，未見特長，王桂林亦平平。此外袁叢美演得還好，他的確是可以做戲的演員。</p>
<p>對於本片的每個工作人員，我們都私自慶幸發現了不少驚奇之處，但是因爲期望之殷，我們的要求也就過於懇切一點了。</p>

<h3>鼙劍影錄（Ｎana）（一）</h3>
<p>— 殷鳴</p>
<p>在那錦繡堆砌，金碧輝煌的大沙發上，娜娜俯伏着，將面龐鑽在絨墊裏，一回兒她的頭抬了起來，對着格雷納嫣然地笑着。她説道，［太柔軟了：：：太香了：：：我愛這種香味：：：］她的聲音是嬌柔無力的，她懶懶地抱住了那個墊子。她躺着的沙發，原來是鴨絨舖成的，可是娜娜一些也不覺得驚奇。實在的，一個月之前，她還睡在草墊子上哩。那時她白天在灶間睡着覺，夜裏在街上徜徉着。居然她吉星高照，遇見了一位貴人，就是那位格雷納老先生，他是巴黎最有勢力的一位戲台老板。他將她造成了一個偉大的女伶。但是娜娜旣不覺得驚奇，也不覺得感激，連什麽印象都没有。她半生遇見的事，形形色色，她都處之淡然，安之若素。譬如説，不久之前，有那麽一天，她看着她母親瘦弱的身體，在被慘殺之後，葬在叢塜裏，她眼看着她母親的屍體放下去，她亦無動於中，認識他的人，都咒駡她，説她没有良心。還有一天，更近了，那天黎明，他聽着那喀擦的一聲，那　落庭的刀切下來，將她父親的首级切了下來，作爲她母親被殺的報酬。旁的女人聽見了聲音，就暈過去了，但是娜娜看完了，慢慢地走開了｜她跑到一爿咖啡店裏，要了一杯紅酒，細細咀嚼着味道。</p>
<p>直到後來格雷納遇見了她，注意到她的絶美的姿容，呌她到他的戲院裏去，她亦就無可無不可的答應了｜其實她心裏並不覺得什麽稀奇。格雷納覺得她頗有演戲的天份，就將她的名字排進去了，她亦不覺得幸運，她亦不覺得高興。在她氷似的冷的心情裏，她祗有一點些微的廻憶，時常在她的胸中起着擾亂。那是一個面容留影。她祗看見過他一次｜在那［七條　魚的咖啡店］裏。他亦没有説過什麽話。他是一個少年軍官，和一帮朋友在一起。娜娜呢｜亦有許多朋友，咪咪和𤩀丁。</p>
<p>在娜娜的平日呢，她喜歡人家知道她是何等樣的人。這樣好使人家容易接近些。但是那天晚上，那個少年軍官的眼睛釘住了她｜他不知不覺地覺得害羞起來，她恨不得能在身上多披件衣服，臉上少顯露些本來的姿態。𤩀丁那時還説過：［軍人那裏有什麽錢呢！］想不到娜娜聽見了𤩀丁提起了錢，竟大發脾氣，和𤩀丁吵了起來。想在娜娜想起來以前的事，就摇着頭，好像要將腦筋上的痕跡，摇掉似的。她還將鼻子凑在枕墊上，嗅着上面的香味。一回兒化妝室的門開了，侍候娜娜的素跑了進來，她手裏托了一大堆的衣服。她看見了娜娜嬌慵無力地躺在沙發上，就對着格雷納喊道：［格雷納先生，你看看她。離啓幕祇有半個鐘頭了，她還躺着像没有事似的哩。這還是頭一次上臺。唉，天哪，我可是急死了｜］（未完）</p>

<h3>Tangshan Coal Mine Labor Strike: Mediation Gradually Shows Promise</h3>
<p>Tangshan Gentry and Business Representatives Confer at the Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>Decided to First Advance 11,000 Yuan for Bereavement Payments</p>
<p>Then Negotiate Resumption Conditions with the Mining Bureau</p>
<p>The Mining Bureau's Attitude is Exceptionally Firm</p>
<p>Tianjin Japanese Consul General Met with Yu Xuezhong Regarding This Labor Strike</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 4th, at 9 PM, Tao Shangming invited Zhao Xun, the factory representative of the Industrial Office, Li Yinchun, and Tangshan gentry and businessmen to a meeting at the Commissioner's Office to discuss solutions to the labor strike. The meeting adjourned at 12 AM without any results. On the 4th, Tao Shangming telephoned the Kailuan Mining Bureau in Tianjin, urging them to quickly send representatives to negotiate terms. The mining company insisted on an unconditional resumption of work and refused to send anyone. On the 4th, around 11 PM, Tangshan miners planned to surround the Commissioner's Office again, demanding that their conditions be met. Tao Shangming urgently sent people to stop them, telling them that he was trying to find a solution and urging them not to surround and disturb again. The workers demanded a final response by noon on the 5th, and all actions were prepared. If the mining company did not send anyone by noon on the 5th, they would take effective action. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 5th, striking Tangshan miners did not make any statements. He Zi'en, a member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, fearing that the deadlock would lead the workers to extremes and affect the market, joined forces with President Sun of Tangshan Jiaotong University, Zhou, the manager of the Bank of Communications, gentlemen Liu Jinping, Liu Xigui, and others, in the capacity of a third party, to discuss matters with Tao Shangming, Zhao Xun, and worker representatives. Because the strike had lasted for a long time and their livelihoods were difficult, the workers were unwilling to listen to Zhao Dazhong's commands and sincerely hoped that the mining company would allow reasonable conditions for them to resume work. Therefore, He and others came forward to mediate, and the situation was quite promising. Tao Shangming, Zhao Xun, and Tangshan gentry held a meeting at the Commissioner's Office on the 5th and decided that the local government should first advance 11,000 yuan to pay compensation for worker injuries and deaths, to ease the labor unrest, and then negotiate terms with the mining company, so that the workers could resume work as soon as possible. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 5th, at 3 PM, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Zhai Lansi, visited Yu Xuezhong at the Hebei Provincial Government regarding the Kailuan Coal Mine labor strike. They talked for a long time. The British side wanted the provincial government to forcefully suppress the workers and arrest Zhao Dazhong, who was instigating the labor unrest. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Mining Bureau successively submitted reports to the Hebei Provincial Government on the 3rd and 4th. (1) "This afternoon, the Mining Bureau received a phone call from Commissioner Tao saying that the leader of the Tangshan disturbance, Zhao Dazhong, claimed at the Commissioner's Office that if the Mining Bureau did not immediately agree to the two demands of increasing wages and paying all workers who did not work during the riots, then the workers would rush into the mine factory at 6 PM today, destroy the radio station, stop the water pumps, and flood the mine shafts, etc. The Mining Bureau has been fully aware of all the circumstances of the frequent riots in various mining areas recently. If there are problems between labor and capital, they should be raised in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the Factory Law. Why should they repeatedly use riotous behavior to pressure the capitalists, endanger lives and property, and disregard national laws, social order, and security? Moreover, Zhao Dazhong is not a worker, so how can he participate? This is even more bizarre. Under these circumstances, the Mining Bureau will never give in. In addition to requesting Commissioner Tao to protect lives and property at the time, it is reasonable to report to Your Excellency. We humbly request you to preside over and protect the lives and property within the Mining Bureau and mining areas." (2) (Above omitted) "The Mining Bureau has not complied with the legal procedures at all in the recent labor unrest. Without any warning to the capitalists, it immediately resorted to riots, endangering lives, damaging property, intimidating good workers, preventing them from going to work, and openly firing guns at disobedient workers, surrounding government offices, intimidating administrative officials and the Mining Bureau, and disregarding the government, disrupting order, which is tantamount to treason. The punishment they deserve seems to be more severe than that stipulated by the laws concerning ordinary labor-capital disputes; otherwise, national laws will lose their effectiveness, local security will not be maintained, and people's lives, property, and rights to be enjoyed within the scope of the law will not be guaranteed. Urgent words, we humbly ask Your Excellency to examine and preside over." (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Volunteers in Mishan Battle the Enemy</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Since March 30th, the Tanaka Detachment, together with the puppet army, has been attacking the anti-Japanese volunteers north of Mishan. Fierce battles have lasted for several days, and both sides have suffered losses. The Japanese claim that one Japanese soldier was killed and one wounded. (5th Hualian Dispatch)</p>

<p>Yesterday's Banquet for High-Ranking Military and Political Figures in Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Huang Shaohong's persuasion, He Yingqin has agreed to take the position of Chief Administrator to guide the autonomy of Inner Mongolia. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin hosted a banquet at Jurentang tonight for North China generals and political figures in Beiping. Those invited included Wan Fulin, Shang Zhen, Wang Shuchang, Jiang Bocheng, Ji Qiao, Fu Zhan Kui, Bao Wen Yue, He Qi Gong, Yuan Liang, Yu Jin, Yin Rugeng, and more than twenty others.

<h3>Puppet Police in Gubeikou Demand Withdrawal Fee</h3>
<p>Using Reimbursement of Huge Housing Repair Costs as a Condition for Withdrawal</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng Negotiates with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Chai Shan Telegraphed Songjing for Consultation</p>
<p>Japanese Emperor's Aide-de-Camp, Machijiri, Arrives in Beiping</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the puppet police in Caojia Road, Gubeikou demanding a huge withdrawal fee, Yin Rugeng is negotiating with the Japanese side. Chai Shan will go on the 6th to investigate the situation and then decide whether to withdraw. The provincial government allocated 10,000 yuan for the installation of long-distance telephone lines between Yutian, Zunhua, Malanyu, Gubeikou, and Tongpingjin. Construction started on the 5th and will be completed in two weeks. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng will not go to Beiping for the time being due to certain matters. Negotiations for the takeover of Malanyu will first be held with Chai Shan in Beiping. Implementation will be scheduled after progress is made. The political power there is originally in our hands, but the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops is the focus of the handover. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Machijiri Teiki, the Japanese Emperor's aide-de-camp who was ordered to comfort the Japanese troops stationed in North China, arrived in Beiping from Tianjin this afternoon. Accompanying him were Chief of Staff Zhu Chi and eight military officers. They are scheduled to inspect Gubeikou on the 6th, return to Beiping on the 7th, and go to Luandong on the 8th for inspection. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After we formally took over Gubeikou, the puppet border police team stationed there has delayed its withdrawal to this day. They stated to our side that the repair costs for the Caojia Roadkou and Nantianguan Beishanyin resident posts amounted to more than 920 yuan, and the repair costs for the puppet police headquarters in Nanguan, Gubeikou, amounted to more than 19,000 yuan. Only after our side reimburses them will they be able to find other houses and relocate. Our authorities believe that such a request is extremely difficult to fulfill in reality, and have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities, hoping for an early resolution. Japanese military officer Chai Shan has telegraphed Matsui, the head of the Kwantung Army Special Affairs Agency in Chengde, inviting him to go to Gubeikou on the 6th to discuss specific measures for the withdrawal of the puppet police. Yin Rugeng originally planned to attend, but due to official business in Tianjin, he has sent Huo Shi, director of the Gubeikou Office, as his representative. The future relocation site of the puppet police may be in Bakeshi Camp. (5th Dispatch)</p>

Yin Rugeng has received the funds and will return to Beiping this afternoon at 4 PM and send someone to assist Han Dianbang in handling the matter. The provincial government received a report that sandbags were piled up at the gates of Yutian City because Captain Han feared that the reorganized police would escape and disrupt the area, so he took severe precautions. The Yutian Security Team is organized into two battalions and two special teams, each battalion with three companies, plus the two special teams, for a total of eight companies. Feng Shoushan was appointed as the captain of the special team, but he is unwilling and wants to expand it into a large battalion. The provincial government holds Yin Rugeng and Han Dianbang responsible for handling this matter. It is rumored that Feng Shoushan secretly came to Tianjin and is active in a certain concession, but after investigation, this is not true. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 4th, the Yutian Security Team suddenly piled sacks on the city gates, created defensive works, and the team soldiers were armed and alert, strictly checking entry and exit.

<p>Men Bingyue Returns to Beiping to Report</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Baotou states that Men Bingyue returned to Beiping this morning to report on his mission and will arrive on the 6th. Yang Monkey's remaining bandits, numbering more than six hundred, fled to Wuchuan and have been surrounded by three regiments of the Jin-Sui Army. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zengruo, Secretary-General of Sun Dianying, telegraphed from Taiyuan to Beiping today, stating that He's letter to Sun has been forwarded. Sun stated that he would come to Beiping after finishing his personal affairs in Taiyuan. Liu telegraphed to Beiping, hoping that the authorities would cancel Sun's position as a member of the Military Branch Committee. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fu Zuoyi telegraphed to President Wang, stating that Sun's troops have been closely deployed between San Sheng Gong and Dengkou, using both coercion and inducement. They have been surrendering one after another in recent days. Today, they have all turned in their weapons, leaving not a single gun or bullet. They have all become unarmed and are being sent to the rear in succession. Except for Yang Monkey, a bandit chief with a thousand followers on the border between Sui and Ningxia, who fled into the mountains, our infantry, cavalry, and artillery joint force has been ordered to fiercely suppress him and has already annihilated four or five hundred bandits and captured his chief of staff, Nan Jingchen. The search and suppression is still actively underway. Countless guns and goods seized at the front are being inventoried by Division Commander Wang Jingguo and Men Bingyue, a senior staff officer. The bandit troops have been thoroughly resolved. This is respectfully reported by telegram. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ma Hongkui's representative, Bai Jianmin, came to Tianjin from Beiping on the 4th to entertain the press. According to him, Chairman Ma has been unable to extricate himself from the reorganization of military and political affairs and the aftermath, but he has decided to come to Beiping in person recently to report everything to the two chairmen, He and Huang. Sun Dianying's troops have been reorganized by various parties, but Yang Monkey's remaining six hundred men are still unwilling to submit and are fleeing east and west. The provincial army is searching and suppressing them and will soon be able to eliminate them. Although Ningxia is nominally a province, it only has eight counties. Since Sun's troops caused disturbances, the province has not received any tax revenue for two months, and the treasury is empty. Therefore, post-disaster relief is urgently needed, waiting for the 50,000 yuan allocated by the central government. At present, there is a lack of food for the people, and transportation in various places has not been restored, making it very difficult to transport supplies from other provinces. The worst affected are Pingluo and Dengkou, while Ningxia is lighter. Yu Ximing's troops have all surrendered their weapons. Ding Futing and Liu Yueting live in Ningxia and will be given other appointments by Chairman Ma in the future. Li Chunhua and Lu Chunyi's troops have recently received orders from the central government to go to Gansu for garrison. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Imperialists' Conspiracy in Tibet</h3>
<p>An Article in the Russian Pravda</p>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda published an article titled "Imperialists' Conspiracy in Tibet," stating, "The Exchange Telegraph Agency reported that a Tibetan delegation visited the Panchen Lama, urging him to enter Tibet. The agency also predicted that the civil war in Tibet is becoming increasingly mature. Since leaving Tibet, the Panchen has turned to serve Japanese imperialism in order to extend the latter's tentacles to Tibet, thereby threatening British interests." The newspaper pointed out that Tibet is the most important part of British imperialism's policy of plundering colonies. The British have established a military group and army in Tibet and are using their army to advance their military actions in China. This military action did not cease until the Dalai Lama's death and has recently been revived. British imperialism has turned "Greater Tibet" into "Lesser Tibet" by nibbling away at the outer edge of the land and is now working to expand it at the expense of other parts of China's territory, while using the soup from Tibet to aid its swallowing of these territories. Therefore, its opposition to the Panchen's return to Tibet is only natural." (4th Tass Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yunnan Military Officer Reports on the Evolution of Yunnan-Burma Boundary Affairs</h3>

<h3>Sino-Turkish Friendship Treaty Signed in Turkish Capital</h3>
<p>Our Representative is Hu Weide</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the Sino-Turkish Friendship Treaty was signed in the Turkish capital on the 4th. Negotiations on the treaty began in 1930 and took nearly four years of back-and-forth discussions before being signed on the 4th of this month. After ratification by the two governments, a commercial treaty will be negotiated. Although it is still too early to talk about sending ministers to each other, the authorities of both countries are already searching and considering candidates. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) For the sake of enhancing friendly relations between the Chinese and Turkish governments, both sides previously sent representatives to negotiate a treaty. However, due to various reasons, negotiations went back and forth for several years without any agreement. Recently, because Minister to Switzerland Hu Shize was going to Egypt to attend the Universal Postal Congress, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed Minister Hu to go to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to directly negotiate and sign a treaty with the Turkish Foreign Minister. According to a telegram from Minister Hu, the Sino-Turkish Friendship Treaty has been negotiated and signed with the Turkish Foreign Minister in the Turkish capital on April 4th. The treaty simply stipulates that the two countries will mutually send diplomatic representatives to enjoy the treatment recognized by the usual principles of international law. After the treaty is ratified by the two governments, the instruments of ratification will be exchanged in Geneva within days. Also, Turkish Foreign Minister Rastou telegraphed our Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang, expressing congratulations, and Wang replied with a telegram of thanks on the 5th. The two telegrams are as follows: (1) Telegram to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: I am extremely pleased to inform you that I have signed the Sino-Turkish Friendship Treaty with Minister Hu. I also take this opportunity to express to Your Excellency that I sincerely hope that the inherent friendly relations between China and Turkey will become even more developed. (2) Reply telegram to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Ankara: I am grateful for your telegram of the 4th.

Huang stated that many locations along the Huangtan and Changcheng lines have already been taken over, and negotiations are underway for those that have not. The proposal for through trains and postal services, previously raised, has been stalled due to differing opinions. North China is currently peaceful. Sun Dianying's troops have been reorganized, and the reorganization of the Yutian security force is also proceeding smoothly. The situation is generally optimistic.

<p>(Hankou) Before his departure, Huang Fu said that Japan's increased troop deployment in eastern Chahar will inevitably affect Inner Mongolia. However, the Bailingmiao Autonomous Council has been scheduled to be established, which is sufficient to respond to the situation. He has ordered relevant authorities to guard against Japan's recruitment of Chinese laborers. There is no need to expand the Peiping Political Reorganization Committee; rumors to the contrary are inaccurate. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Tang Youren stated that the situation in North China is not only serious diplomatically, but also complex in various other aspects. In the future, we must improve domestic governance to adequately respond to the situation. After persuasion, Shi Ying has agreed to return to Nanjing within days. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Control Yuan Members Advocate Expanding Powers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Members of the Control Yuan advocate expanding the powers of the Control Yuan regarding the section on its powers in the draft constitution.

<h3>President Wang Orders Investigation into Groups Damaging Clothing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang telegraphed the Ministry of Interior, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Peiping Political Reorganization Committee on the 5th, stating: "Reading newspaper reports, it is said that there are so-called 'destruction groups' in Hangzhou, Peiping, and other places, specializing in cutting and damaging Western-style clothes, and that Nanjing is also about to initiate such activities. Please investigate whether this is true. The Capital Police Department and the Public Security Bureau should be ordered to take concrete preventative measures and conduct strict investigations. It should be understood that such actions are childish and reckless, making us a laughingstock to the world. Furthermore, domestic woolen fabrics are a new emerging industry, and the government should actively promote and protect them, giving them the same importance as domestic silk and native cloth. If these people are allowed to run rampant under this pretext, it will not only infringe on the freedom and protection of the people's bodies and property, but also stifle the budding of new industries, which is unacceptable under the law. Moreover, today the army, navy, and air force personnel all wear uniforms, which are also so-called Western suits. In the eyes of these people, they should also be included in the destruction list. Is this not wanting the army, navy, and air force personnel to wear long gowns and mandarin jackets to the battlefield? Furthermore, our country, in view of its weakness, is promoting militarization. If everyone must wear long gowns and mandarin jackets, is this not the height of contradiction? Promoting domestic goods is indeed an urgent task, but we should also diligently persuade people to use domestic silk and cloth when wearing long gowns and mandarin jackets, and domestic woolen fabrics when wearing Western suits. If they act irrationally and presumptuously, they will be liable to violating the police regulations at the very least, and the criminal law at the most. Those responsible for maintaining public safety must not sit idly by and allow this to happen, lest they incur blame. Please comply accordingly." (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Reliance, Evasion, and Researching Japan's Court</h3>
<p>The Chinese people have always suffered from the common ailment of dependency. Before the Northeast was completely lost, we relied on the policy of non-resistance. Immediately after the loss, we relied on the League of Nations and the United States to come to our defense. Unexpectedly, the League of Nations proved ineffective and the United States was too cautious. So, we hoped to rely on the Soviet Union and Japan to engage in all-out war. Diplomatic avenues were not entirely smooth, so we also hoped for internal disturbances within Japan, hoping they would have an unprecedented revolution. Because if Japan were to truly have a revolution, it would naturally be too busy to take care of itself. Then, recovering the Northeast would be as easy as turning one's hand. As for whether such a lucky and convenient thing would happen, we could just leave it to fate.</p>
<p>However, regardless, those infected with the disease of reliance will never forget the goals they hope for. In other words, the Chinese people, while holding onto the extravagant hopes that the League of Nations, the United States, and Russia would provide assistance from the sidelines and that Japan would have a revolution, still wanted to recover the four eastern provinces. Now, it seems that the symptoms have become even more dangerous. Because most people believe that relying on various parties offers little hope. But if we don't rely on them, we can't see a way out. Therefore, the disease of reliance has transformed into the disease of evasion. You evade, saying you won't do it. I evade, saying you are incompetent. Fortunately, national affairs are everyone's responsibility. If you don't do your best, how can you blame me? Thus, everyone goes their own way, seeking their own peace. The people's spirit within the country gradually goes from vigorous to indifferent, and from indifferent to frozen. It's a pity that the fate of tens of millions of compatriots is entrusted to the four eastern provinces, but in the minds of the general public within the customs, I fear that there is not much deep impression left.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that a very small number of people among the intellectual class, perhaps because their self-awareness is particularly sharp and the suffering they feel is particularly profound, have been forced to fight alone, diligently researching Japanese economic and scientific journals, trying to guess their psychology. It seems that they are not satisfied with merely fulfilling their initial intellectual desires and considering the matter closed. The Japanese believe that this kind of research has profound implications, and is not merely a superficial phenomenon. The focus is also on this. However, it is not necessary to discuss how effective it is for a very small number of people wielding pens to attempt to single-handedly shoulder the heavy burden of national survival, while also having to rely on materials from the enemy to seek thorough understanding. But their arduous efforts are enough to make us sigh incessantly.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the vast majority of people in the country have gone from reliance to evasion, and from evasion to living in comfort. The facts are there, and there is no denying it. Now, what we hope for from the people and the government is, first, to quickly cure the diseases of evasion and reliance, to clearly admit our own errors, and not to pray to gods and ghosts, or to complain about heaven and blame others. In particular, the government should guide everyone to do the work of "knowing that it cannot be done, but doing it anyway." Head-on research of Japan is one method of doing this kind of work.</p>
<p>Speaking of researching Japan, it is somewhat different from ordinary academic research. We must have a preconceived notion in our minds. We must not be intimidated by the various superficial advances of Japan as a result of our research. We must know that while Japan is indeed much stronger than China, it still inevitably lags behind when competing with Europe and the United States. The more we research Japan, the more we must restore our national self-confidence, and the more we must eliminate the inferior roots of reliance and evasion. There are many people in the country now who have studied in Japan. Some of them, perhaps because they understand the great principle of "knowing yourself and knowing your enemy" too thoroughly, have the model of Japan as something amazing deeply embedded in their minds, and are unwilling to easily smash it. Too much is as bad as too little, and they also urgently need to be improved.</p>
<p>Some people say that in these extraordinary times amidst national disaster, the atmosphere is so stifling that they don't even want to speak. It's better to research some Japanese or Soviet problems to find some solace. They don't know that using research as solace is like using escapist Zen as transcendence. It's equally useless, and equally unable to escape the circle of reliance and evasion. If we unfortunately reach this point, we must also find a way to correct it.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Accelerates the Construction of Double Tracks on the Siberian Railway</h3>
<p>The Work is Largely Completed Except for the Coastal Provinces</p>
<p>Actively Promoting Colonization of the Far East</p>
<p>Troops are Gathering, Aiming at Self-Defense</p>
<p>(London) The new double tracks of the Siberian Railway, except for a few sections of bridges and tunnels, are now completed. The double tracks of the Amur, Vladivostok, and Dalniy line are also under construction. This was foreshadowed by Chairman Molotov at the People's Committee meeting on February 6th. Once this project is completed, Soviet Russia will still have 1,800 miles of railway that need to be built with double tracks. In the past two years, the policy of the Soviet Russian government has been to strive to enable the Far Eastern Army under General Galen to be self-sufficient. Therefore, it has specially promoted colonization in the Far Eastern territory of Soviet Russia, and granted various special rights, such as exemption from certain taxes and the government buying local products at high prices, to the residents of the area. At the same time, new coal mines are being mined in the Baikal region, and it is said that the production is extremely rich. News from all sides says that there is a thriving scene in the Soviet Russian Far East. The salaries of the army in the Far East have also been increased. Its strength currently totals 150,000 soldiers, and the army is equipped with many artillery pieces and tanks, and there is a gas manufacturing plant. Its headquarters are located in Chita, and it is reported that there are 250 aircraft stationed in Heihe. Moscow has repeatedly stated that this preparation is aimed at self-defense, but from time to time publishes alarming news about Japan's plot to attack Soviet Russia. However, well-informed sources in London say that relations between Japan and Russia have greatly improved in recent weeks. This is evidenced by the conciliatory negotiations between Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan Yurenev on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway.

<h3>The Doctrine of a Great Air Force Threatens Japan</h3>
<p>The World Society says that in recent years, the Soviet Union has actively focused on the progress of the Far East air routes. The Moscow-Irkutsk line has been extended to Vladivostok. Other routes such as the Khabarovsk-Nikolayevsk-Sakhalin route, as well as the route from Marinsk, a stop along that line, to Ayon on Sakhalin, the Verkhoyansk-Kuren route, and the Nikolayevsk-Petropavlovsk route, have all been implemented.</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned routes, the Khabarovsk-Sakhalin route is the most worthy of our attention. This route began in January 1930, and except for the 4th, 10th, and 11th of each month, it operates every five days on the Khabarovsk-Okha line (taking 8 hours and 45 minutes) and the Khabarovsk-Ayon line (taking 6 hours and 45 minutes). In addition to night flight equipment, the air route has three intermediate airfields and 15 temporary landing fields.</p>
<p>The one that is most threatened by the Soviet Union's doctrine of a great air force is, of course, Japan. If we take Vladivostok as the center point and draw a radius of 1,500 kilometers, which is the range of activity of a modern ordinary bomber, then the entire Korean peninsula, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Manchuria, Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Okinawa, and Amami Oshima will all be included in that circle. Even if we take half, 100 kilometers, a large part of Korea and part of the coastal areas of Japan will also be under the threat of enemy aircraft. Recently, the Soviet authorities have been particularly focused on the durability of the range, aiming at the most active attack on Japan, and have been designing and building a TB-2 heavy bomber. The aircraft can carry 16 people, is equipped with an all-domestic M-17 600-horsepower engine, has a top speed of 240 kilometers per hour, and has a range of more than 14 hours. If it advances from Vladivostok to Tokyo, it will only take five hours to reach the skies over Tokyo, and it can comfortably engage in bombing and aerial combat within five hours.</p>
<p>As for fighter planes, the Soviet authorities have recently improved the I-15 (top speed 300 kilometers per hour) fighter plane, equipping it with an all-domestic M-22 700-horsepower engine, increasing the maximum speed to 510 kilometers per hour. It can fly from Osaka to Tokyo in a little over an hour.</p>
<p>The reconnaissance plane is the R-6 type. This is a two-seater aircraft equipped with an all-domestic M-34 800-horsepower engine, with a maximum speed of 240 kilometers per hour and a range of 7 hours. As a medium-range reconnaissance aircraft, its practical value is truly worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Extension of the Non-Aggression Pact Between Russia and Eastern European Countries</h3>
<p>Remains in Effect for Ten Years</p>
<p>Only Poland Has Not Signed</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia and Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have decided to extend the previously signed non-aggression treaty for a new ten-year term. The treaty was jointly signed here on Wednesday by Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and the ministers of the three countries. The effective period of the treaty has been extended to 1945. Furthermore, the new treaty extending the non-aggression treaty between Soviet Russia and Poland has not yet been signed. (5th Kuomin News Agency)</p>
<p>Contents of the Document</p>
<p>The document has an introduction and two articles of text. The introduction states that the signatory countries signed this document because the signatory countries all wish to find a solid basis for promoting the friendly relations between the aforementioned countries, and are willing to provide new evidence to confirm that their peaceful friendship is appropriate and firm. The introduction also states that the contracting states are inspired by a desire to promote the consolidation of world peace and stability, and the development of peaceful relations between Eastern European countries. The contracting states added that the conclusion of the Mutual Non-Aggression and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes Convention has had commendable effects on their state relations and the resolution of the above-mentioned issues. Article 1 of the text stipulates that the above-mentioned convention and its accompanying documents shall continue to be in effect until December 31, 1945. Article 2 stipulates that this document shall be ratified as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Address by the Russian Foreign Minister</p>
<p>After signing the document, Litvinov delivered a speech saying, "The urgency of our three governments to extend these conventions can express their goodwill and the richness of their accumulated will for peace, and the above two points are further confirmed by the speed with which the Soviet Union's motion was realized in these conventions. This speed is unprecedented in diplomatic history, because only two weeks after the motion was proposed, the document was signed today. Does this not clearly show the long-term growth of mutual trust and understanding between our three countries? We are now extending these conventions for ten years. Ten years is still an initiative in conventions of this nature. However, what we must tell the world is that our proposal is neither temporary in nature nor prompted by accidental economic conditions. In fact, it is a manifestation of our firm policy of peace, so it is not limited by any period of time. One element in this policy is to safeguard the independence of the young countries you represent. The world talks and writes about the war clouds that fill the world every day, and we rarely hear any voices saying that this disaster can be avoided. Governments and politicians all agree that war is inevitable, and what they are considering is only the worldwide rearmament and the arms race. However, the past has clearly shown us that these actions not only cannot avoid war, but can only promote it. However, the document signed today will proclaim to the world that there are now several countries that take the consolidation of peace, at least the consolidation of peace in the region they can influence to some extent, as their international task. These countries will continue to implement their policies to maintain peace in specific regions, and the Soviet Union's policy is to want these countries to join the front line of maintaining peace. All patriotism, nationalism, and racial and ethnic prejudices are irrelevant to the Soviet Union. What the Soviet Union considers its problem is not to conquer others, or expand its influence, nor to expand its own territory. What it cites as its national glory is not militarism and education that does not depreciate the eyes of murderers. The problem and glory of the Soviet Union lies in the realization of its ideal of building a socialist society, because this is where the Soviet Union originated and where the meaning of its own existence lies. If the Soviet Union is not obstructed, it will devote all its strength to this. If someone calls out the list of countries willing to maintain and promote world peace, then they must answer, 'We are here.' Judging from the direct acceptance of our proposal by the countries you represent (this point has been expressed by the document signed today), your countries must also be able to answer in unison with the Soviet Union, 'We are here,' when this list of countries is called out."</p>
<p>Lithuanian Representative's Response</p>
<p>The Lithuanian minister then delivered a reply, deeply believing that the Baltic countries would fully support the great and deeply moving thoughts expressed by the Soviet Foreign Minister, without hesitation. He continued, "The extension of the non-aggression pact is extremely important, because the completion of this move is in a situation where any effort to consolidate world peace has special significance."

<h3>Saito Actively Responds to Internal and External Crises</h3>
<p>The Army Minister Will Visit Elder Statesmen to State the Military's Views</p>
<p>Konoe Meets with Hirota to Hear His Policy Towards the United States</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito has decided to cling to his position regarding cabinet issues, and plans to encourage all cabinet members in tomorrow's cabinet meeting to abandon their previous passive attitude and adopt a more active approach in order to break through international isolation. Regarding measures after withdrawal from the League of Nations takes effect next March and the Second Washington Conference, he should strongly support Hirota's diplomacy. All cabinet members are now also quite united, preparing to deal with all crises with the strength of unity. Regarding the rice control countermeasures and rural relief bills among domestic issues, since he has already decided to cling to his position, he will also actively establish fundamental policies. If there are no sudden changes, Saito said that the cabinet is willing to wait until the crisis of 1936 is over before retiring. (5th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi went to worship at the Kansai Imperial Mausoleum the other day, and plans to return to Tokyo at 10:00 PM tonight. Tomorrow, he will go to Xingxingjin to meet with Saionji to report on the army's budget for this year and the plan to build the Eastern Province. His main purpose is to state the military's attitude towards domestic and foreign policy. According to the army, its policies towards domestic affairs, Manchukuo, and Russia have not changed. Army Minister Hayashi also discussed the military's attitude with General Araki the other day, so this visit to Saionji has aroused much attention from all sectors.

<p>(Tokyo) Duke Konoe Fumimaro, speaker of the House of Peers, who is about to go to the United States, met with Foreign Minister Hirota on the afternoon of the 4th to hear Foreign Minister Hirota's opinions on the US issue. After meeting with the Foreign Minister, Konoe told reporters, "I am going to the United States this time in a personal capacity, and it is not necessary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send staff to accompany me. However, because I will be meeting with the US President or other dignitaries, I will first listen to Foreign Minister Hirota's entire picture of harmonious diplomacy, especially his policy towards the United States, in order to convey it to the American people. The trip to the United States will last about two months, and I plan to return to the country in early September. There is currently no intention to go to Europe." (5th Japan Alliance Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hirota Puts All His Efforts</h3>
<p>To Open Up a Way Out for Japanese-American Diplomacy</p>
<p>China United News Agency Tokyo Correspondence: Since Hirota Hiroki took office as Foreign Minister, his diplomatic understanding has indeed undergone a transformation. Foreign Minister Hirota's approach to handling his diplomacy is the same as that of Uchida, acknowledging the Asian Monroe Doctrine, but his methods are different. Foreign Minister Uchida, disregarding the world's condemnation, strongly implemented the so-called scorched-earth diplomacy with the support of Army Minister Araki's military force. Since he was willing to have the whole country as scorched earth, why bother talking about diplomacy? Foreign Minister Hirota is taking on the position of Foreign Minister to settle this contradiction, that is, to use diplomatic means to achieve the same effect as what would be gained with the strength of a ruined country's military force. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that if Japan wants to carry out its continental policy, the three countries that oppose it most vigorously are Britain, the United States, and Russia, and China is the object of its sacrifice. Britain, because of its domestic unrest, does not dare to lightly engage in war with Japan. Therefore, the only countries that are mortal enemies of Japan are the United States and Russia. Although China wants to resist, its current national strength cannot defeat Japan. If the United States and Russia do not come out to obstruct, then Japan can do whatever it wants in China. This is the basic understanding of Hirota's diplomacy. Under this understanding, Foreign Minister Hirota's only means of breaking the diplomatic deadlock is to first adopt a policy of reconciliation with the United States. If the United States tacitly approves its Eastern policy, the "Manchukuo" issue can be said to be Japan's victory. Under this policy, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is gathering the elite of its diplomatic circles to attack the United States. There are many important Japanese figures who have been responsible for US diplomacy since the September 18th Incident, including Dr. Nitobe, Duke Tokugawa Iesato (former Speaker of the Upper House), Viscount Ishii Kikujiro (former Foreign Minister), Marquis Matsukata Otogiko (Roosevelt's old classmate), and Duke Konoe Fumimaro (current Speaker of the Upper House, scheduled to go to the United States on May 17). These important figures are working from the sidelines to help Ambassador Saito Hiroshi promote the work of harmonious diplomacy with the United States. Their goals are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan recognizes the permanent neutrality of the Philippines, but the United States must withdraw its land, sea, and air military bases from the island. (2) The United States amends its immigration law to eliminate anti-Japanese clauses. (3) The United States recognizes "Manchukuo" as a fait accompli, and recognizes it at an appropriate time, or no longer reiterates the Stimson Doctrine, while Japan reiterates that "Manchukuo" implements open door and equal opportunity. The Japanese side is also willing to agree with the United States on the security of investment in North China. (4) After the United States agrees to the principles listed on the right, Japan is willing to give up the right to equal armaments. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has proposed this content to the US side. Under this understanding, a ten-year non-aggression treaty can be concluded between Japan and the United States. This is a unilateral demand from the Japanese side. It is certainly not easy for the US side to abandon the Stimson Doctrine given the current domestic situation. Moreover, the content of the non-aggression treaty proposal is more advanced than the content of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. The US Republican Party has strongly criticized the Japanese side for tearing up this treaty since the September 18th Incident. Although Roosevelt has historical feelings for Japan, it is not easy to reverse the situation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry is also very clear about this point, but it is especially creating an atmosphere and probing US public opinion. Ambassador Saito's report on the various items mentioned on the right after returning to China at the end of May is certainly worthy of our country's attention.</p>
<h3>Making Propaganda to the United States</h3>
<p>Tokugawa Completes His Mission and Returns Home</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Speaker of the House of Peers, Duke Tokugawa Iesato, arrived in Yokohama this afternoon aboard the Japanese ship Tatsuta Maru. Tokugawa told reporters that during his eight months in the United States, he had in-depth discussions with people from all walks of life in the United States on Japanese-American issues, and the atmosphere of friendship between the two countries had become slightly thicker. He denied that a major war would occur between Japan and the United States. Tokugawa broadcast four times in the United States, and gave forty lectures. In his lectures, he strongly denied that Japan had any intention of war against the United States, and opposed the theory of Japanese-American war.</p>

<h3>Britain and America Both Advocate Maintaining Current Naval Ratios</h3>
<p>Germany Said to be Participating in Next Year's Naval Conference</p>
<p>Aim is to Seek Revision of the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>Hoping to Ensure Maritime Security, Not to Equally Divide Sea Power</p>
<p>(London) According to foreign news reports, the United States seemed to have suggested to Britain that they exchange views before the naval conference in 1935. However, according to British officials, Britain has not received such a suggestion. Since Britain issued a memorandum on disarmament in March 1933, negotiations have continued between London and Washington, so there is no question of proposing an exchange of views. However, the content of the discussions between the two sides concerns the naval tonnage that should be replaced after 1935. So far, no agreement has been reached on this point. It is generally believed that Britain and the United States have no intention of modifying the current naval ratio at the 1935 naval conference, which is evident here. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today's newspaper reported that Germany will participate in the naval conference to be held next year. Its purpose is only to seek revision of the Treaty of Versailles in order to obtain greater security at sea, and not to equally divide sea power with the world's major naval powers. The German newspaper also published an official statement denying the claim that Germany plans to embark on a large-scale naval construction program. The report stated that it would take several years for Germany to build a large number of warships, and Germany does not have the financial resources for this. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Battleship Renovation Plan Shelved</h3>
<p>To be Discussed After Next Year's Naval Conference</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Concerns About the Situation in the Far East</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Naval Affairs Committee rejected the proposal to renovate the two armored ships, the "California" and the "Tennessee," at a cost of 20 million yuan. Foreign news sources say that this renovation project would take a long time. Once started, the two ships would not be available for use for two or even three years. Therefore, the refusal to start work is a sign of the government's concerns about the Far East issue. Recently, someone inquired about this news to Admiral Standley, Chief of Naval Operations. According to his reply, all obsolete US warships may be destroyed due to future naval agreements, so all renovation plans should be temporarily suspended and considered again after the naval conference next year. The reason why the "California" and "Tennessee" are not being renovated for the time being is nothing more than this. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(London) Yesterday, it was reported that Davis, the former US representative to the Disarmament Conference, had returned to London from Stockholm and may attend the meeting of the Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference as an observer.

According to the reply, Davis's stay in Europe is purely a private matter, and the State Department has no knowledge of his attendance at the meeting of the Steering Committee. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Some believe that Britain may advocate postponing the meeting of the Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference. The purpose is to allow the ongoing negotiations to continue through diplomatic channels. However, the Steering Committee is still scheduled to convene on April 10. If the meeting needs to be postponed, it should be decided by the Steering Committee itself. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Lies in Insufficient Righting Moment Against Waves</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the capsizing of the Japanese torpedo boat "Tomozuru," the inquiry committee headed by Admiral Nomura is conducting a detailed investigation into the cause and other matters. Today, the Ministry of the Navy announced the following: The capsizing of the Tomozuru, after comprehensive investigation, is believed not to be due to the operation of the boat or the watertight integrity of the boat. The main reason is that the righting moment against waves was insufficient. (Dentsu dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>World Women's Organizations Call for Peace</h3>
<p>(Paris) French women have also joined the World Women's Organizations to send a petition to the influential church leaders of various countries. The main purpose of the petition is to promote the unity of church leaders of various countries to promote the movement for world peace. The content of the petition is as follows: [We are the mothers of children, and the children of the world are our children. How can we sit idly by and watch our children slaughter each other without lending a hand? We are women, so whether we believe in God or not, it can be left aside. Our strength can be included in the word "love." Because of love, we boldly disregard the manner of diplomacy. We are so worried about current affairs that we cannot sleep or eat, so we have to petition the spiritual leaders of various religions in the world, such as Gandhi, Besant, and Einstein, and people with ideals and beliefs. We have never forgotten the past efforts of these people (referring to the leaders) to arouse world public opinion, so we cry out to these people by the side of the abyss, saying, "The world has entered a dangerous period. We women can never believe in the authority of international propagators of death, but we are willing to express our faith in the authority of the spirit. Driven by a single thought, we will, in the name of our innocent children, and in the name of mothers' love for their children, earnestly beg the spiritual authorities of the world, because only these people can create a group of sacrifices, continuously and tirelessly, demanding that the governments of various countries lay down their butcher knives." The above petition represents the 800,000 current female teachers from various countries and has been signed by Ms. Bunting, the chairman of the organization. Other organizations listed in the petition include the Education Committee of the World Friendship Alliance of Church Bishops, Gandhi's friends, and the International Women's Association.

<h3>French Government Issues Austerity Decrees, Civil Servants Rise Up in Resistance</h3>
<p>Decide to Launch a General Strike Starting on May 1st</p>
<p>President Voluntarily Reduces Salary as a National Example</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, French Prime Minister Doumergue has signed 15 decrees of the French government to ensure the safety of French finances. The saved government expenses will amount to approximately 2,500,000,000 francs. The contents of the decrees will be announced on Thursday. The main purpose of the government's cost reduction is to reduce official salaries. It is said that in addition to the reduction of official salaries, the French government will also order 68,000 elderly officials to retire. Prime Minister Doumergue's achievement this time is that he implemented it when French finances were in deficit, which can be said to be a decisive move. It is said that previous French prime ministers had also made similar efforts, but the results were complete failures and repeatedly led to the resignation of the cabinet. French officials are very united politically. Previous prime ministers of France have never been able to deal with them successfully. The French national budget for 1934, in addition to a shortfall of 6,000,000,000 francs, still has to repay domestic public debt and other items that are due, amounting to approximately 17,000,000,000 francs. This type of public debt is highly trusted by the French people. (Kokumin dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Paris) French civil servants will be greatly affected by the government's salary cuts, so they have risen up in resistance. The Civil Servants Union held a meeting today and decided to notify all members, including employees of public transportation companies, to launch a general strike starting on May 1st until the government withdraws the salary cut plan. It is said that French Prime Minister Doumergue wrote to the President a few days ago, advocating the abolition of concurrent positions and prohibiting the simultaneous receipt of salaries and pensions. Civil servants with lower salaries will have their salaries reduced by 5%, and those with higher salaries will have their salaries reduced by 10%. President Lebrun has voluntarily reduced his salary by 20%, and cabinet members have also expressed their willingness to reduce their salaries by 15%.

<h3>Australian Official Visits Japan as Prelude to Australia-Japan Negotiations</h3>
<p>Aim is to Eliminate Trade War</p>
<p>About to Travel to China</p>
<p>Soejima, an important official of the Australian government, arrived here today and will travel to China, Japan, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and Annam for three months. Soejima holds the three positions of Minister of Justice, Foreign Affairs, and Industry in the Australian Cabinet. According to official sources, Soejima's purpose in traveling is to enhance friendly relations between Australia and its neighboring countries and has nothing to do with commerce, but his entourage can provide all necessary information regarding commerce. However, it is generally believed that Soejima's trip has a mission: to negotiate a solution with Japan to avoid the possibility of a trade war between Australia and Japan. Australia had previously proposed increasing import taxes on Japanese goods due to the low value of the Japanese currency. Japan replied that Japan buys more from Australia than it sells to Australia. If Australia raises tariffs, it will be unfavorable to Japan, and Japan will have no choice but to purchase raw materials, such as wool, that it currently purchases from Australia from other markets.

<h3>The United States is About to Implement a Financial Blockade Against Europe</h3>
<p>Due to Prolonged Non-Repayment of War Debts by Various Countries</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Debts Will be Handled in the Same Way</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Congress completed the formulation of Johnson's proposal. This proposal will deal with the financial markets of the United States, because various countries have promised to repay the debts they previously borrowed from the United States, but they have not been fulfilled. The resolution has been placed in the drawer of President Roosevelt's desk and can be processed immediately upon the President's return from fishing. In the near future, the United States will implement a financial blockade policy against the following countries: Britain, France, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Australia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Except for Finland, all European countries are on the list of boycotts. The same steps will be taken to deal with the debts owed by Soviet Russia. Former President Roosevelt had also planned to have the Soviet Russian Import and Export Bank handle the case. Legislative authorities are now studying this issue because the debts were lent during Trotsky's tenure and may be considered a type of war debt. Although Germany's debts are not included in Johnson's proposal, it is generally believed that the debts between the United States and Germany have long been cut off because the interest rates of German banks have been disrupted by foreign public debts. Johnson's proposal is very firm, advocating that the United States will never lend another yuan to European countries. US authorities and US companies, whether individual or investment-oriented, will be prohibited from lending money to countries that have not repaid their debts and will not purchase the public debt tickets of these countries. Last week, the US Treasury Secretary added a correction, saying that there was a claim in Johnson's proposal that a group of New York banks planned to purchase a large number of French public debts and sell them in the United States. The Treasury Secretary has stated that this rumor is untrue. According to Johnson's proposal, it was passed by the Senate in February after reconsideration. (Kokumin dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Wang and Chiang Discuss the New Life Movement by Telegram</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Wang Zeng telegraphed Chiang to inquire about the boundaries of the New Life Movement's simplicity, etc. One concern is that it will interfere too much and become a disturbance, and the other is that it will be too ostentatious and turn into hypocrisy. For example, in the previous National Goods Movement in Beijing, shouting "Down with Western suits" caused panic among domestic woolen fabrics and advocating cloth clothing caused silk and satin to have no way out. These must be paid attention to. Chiang replied with two telegrams from Yanjiang, noting that the New Life Movement is to improve old bad habits. It must go from simple to complex, put public interests first and private interests second, extend oneself to others, and go from near and small to far and large. For the time being, the types are limited to rules and cleanliness. Emphasis should be placed on persuasion, not coercion, and guidance should come before supervision. Even if supervision is necessary, it should only apply to civil servants and students. The location should be limited to public places such as machines, schools, roads, docks, theaters, and hotels and should not extend to private bodies and homes. In particular, it is not appropriate for the authorities to take over, losing the interest of the people in participating as a group. The so-called "Four Not's, Six Not's, Ten Commandments, and Eight Precepts" should not be mixed in. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Xinjiang Diplomatic Envoy Wu Aichen Meets with Luo Wengan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Jingchen, Xinjiang Diplomatic Envoy, departed from Moscow on March 7th and arrived in Beijing on the night of the 4th. He reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 5th, awaiting an audience with President Wang Jingwei. He met with Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 5th. According to the discussion: (1) The Sheng-Ma conflict has indeed come to an end. Ma has led his troops deep into southern Xinjiang from Turpan. The disaster of war has not been extinguished, and there is a risk of recurrence in the future. (2) Zhang Peiyuan was indeed killed in a sniper attack during the loss of the army. (3) The independent situation in southern Xinjiang has become a reality. When Minister Luo toured Xinjiang last year, he originally intended to go to southern Xinjiang to offer comfort, and the people were prepared to warmly welcome him. However, due to the resumption of the Sheng-Ma war and the obstruction of transportation, Luo did not go, resulting in today's situation, which is deeply regrettable. The current independent situation is only manipulated by a few leaders, and the people still oppose it. If a solution is found as soon as possible, it can still be saved. (4) The overall situation in Xinjiang is extremely complex, especially in terms of diplomacy. Various countries are manipulating and instigating. If we do not fully respond, the destruction is worrisome. (5) I have been in Xinjiang for many years. I was summoned back to Beijing and will present all the details I know for your reference.

<h3>Japanese Activities in Europe (Continued) World Telegraph Service</h3>
<p>Economic and Political Advance Threatens All Countries</p>
<p>Using Money to Make Unfavorable Propaganda Against Our Country</p>
<p>The situation in Ethiopia is such, and the situations in other places on both sides of the Red Sea, such as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, are also largely the same. Egypt was originally a market that the British were confident they could monopolize for a long time through political power, but because of the devaluation of the Japanese currency, the extremely low Japanese wages, and the fact that Japanese women and children also work day and night with men, the price of Japanese goods is extremely low, and British goods cannot compete no matter what. In ten years, Japan's exports to Egypt have jumped from 558,000 pounds to 2,152,000 pounds. On the other hand, the trade of the British in the Nile region, taking only textiles produced in Lanka City as an example, has decreased by half in sales.</p>
<p>The above describes the Japanese economic activities in Europe. Whether in Europe or in places outside Europe that Europeans have always regarded as economic spheres of influence, it is, in short, a threat that Europeans have gradually and deeply felt since the September 18th Incident. Before the September 18th Incident, Europeans believed that Japan's military power was inviolable, and that Japan's position in East Asia was something they could do nothing about. After the September 18th Incident, after many new facts, they further felt that Japan was terrible, not only in the Pacific. Japan's aggression does not only rely on military strength. In today's Europe and the United States, where all industries are depressed, there are still Japanese people coming to seize the European market on which they depend for survival. This cannot help but make them wary and recall the phantom of the "Yellow Peril."</p>
<p>In addition to economic activities, let's take a look at political activities. Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, Japan seems to have no political activities in Europe on the surface. In fact, it is not the case. When the September 18th Incident occurred, Europe and the United States were in the midst of an economic panic. Neither the United States, Russia, nor the major powers had the strength to intervene in the dramatic changes in the Far East. These countries knew that the current Japan was taking advantage of the chaos to fish in troubled waters. If you don't have the real power to subdue him, then he will not give up. Therefore, instead of acting impulsively and rashly breaking with him, it is better to endure for a while and wait until the difficulties of the countries themselves are resolved before planning a comprehensive response. Japan also saw through this trick, so after seizing the four northeastern provinces, it temporarily stopped further aggression and first devoted all its efforts to managing and enriching the land it had already obtained in order to consolidate its foundation on the mainland. This can be naturally understood by looking at the recent actions of Japan in the Northeast. On the one hand, they never stop military rectification. The strength of the Japanese navy has already exceeded the 5:5:3 ratio compared to the United Kingdom and the United States, because although the number of ships and tonnage of Japan on the surface meet the 5:5:3 ratio, in fact, Japan is building many warships there in the name of other countries (such as South American countries). Once something happens, the shipbuilders will not deliver the ships to the original owners, and those many warships will all become Japan's own warships. The navy is like this, and the army and air force are also constantly expanding there. At the same time, Puyi's usurpation is naturally a profound warning from Japan to China and the world. Although the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is somewhat enough to add to the concerns of the Japanese, the Japanese know that the United States and Russia are difficult to win, and the Japanese also know that the United States and Russia are tolerant and self-respecting and will not easily try. What Japan is planning is not now but in the future.</p>
<p>What Japan fears in the future is (1) the joint actions of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia, which have interests in China and the Pacific, against Japan, and (2) the revival of China. Anyone with historical knowledge who understands the world situation has no doubt about the latter. Although the slowness is difficult to predict, the former may not come true because of the latter. Conversely, the more time the latter takes, the more inevitable the former becomes. Mussolini's so-called [The fate of the Pacific depends on the role played by the Chinese in this century] is most meaningful if interpreted in this way. In short, Japan's activities in Europe are completely centered on these two ideas, that is, on the one hand, using Germany and France to contain the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States, so that they have no time to take care of themselves, and on the other hand, trying to cover up his conspiracy to provoke discord in China and seek to prolong China's chaos and disunity. It also uses the news agencies that take retainers of international news agencies and its own propaganda to make Europeans disappointed in China and to make China's international position increasingly degenerate.</p>
<p>The ingenuity and flexibility of Japan's propaganda business are truly admirable. The expenses paid by the Japanese government and the financial community for this business are not within the reach of our current strength. There is no message from the Japanese Associated Press that is not published. If the place of the dispatch is only Japan, only the Northeast estimated by Japan, it is not surprising. The wonderful thing is that there are often messages stating that they are from Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, or Guangzhou, so it should be messages from the Chinese side, but they often say things that are unfounded, fabricated, to deceive European readers, and to slander China. For example, saying that so-and-so is pro-Japanese, that a certain important person advocates Sino-Japanese cooperation, or that a certain general and a certain general are fighting again, or that the Communist Party is approaching a certain place, that bandits are rampant in a certain place, or that a certain border area is independent. Of these messages, one out of ten is often close to the truth, and the messages that are unfavorable to China are always the same, because there are people like Chong Deqiu Shui who are stationed in Europe all the time and are proficient in the European news business, because there is also money, so these messages are sent, not only are they not published, but they are also said to be from Nanjing when they are published, the newspaper says they are from Nanjing, and they are said to be from Guangzhou, the newspaper says they are from Guangzhou. Anyway, the Chinese messages that the Japanese provide to European newspapers, the Chinese themselves are still dreaming. A drop of water can become a river. Such bad news is often published in European newspapers and magazines. I ask, can people who only rely on newspapers to get knowledge have a good impression of China? It is a pity that China only had a news agency in Europe after the September 18th Incident. The days are still short and the capital is limited. However, fortunately, there is this news agency. Europeans are gradually getting real Chinese news from the Chinese. Just in the past short period of time, the contribution of this news agency can be said to be very valuable. However, in order to be on par with the Japanese Associated Press, there must be strong capital, there must be government rewards, and there must be practical and long-term assistance from the business community.</p>
<p>This is to say that the Japanese are using propaganda in Europe to deceive the facts and damage China. As for Japan's desire to use Germany and France to contain the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States, this is also an obvious fact. Germany and Japan are both countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations. Since Hitler came to power, Germany and Russia have been incompatible. If Russia has something to do in the Far East, it is inevitable that there will be worries in Western Europe. When the relationship between Japan and Russia was dangerous, some people spread the rumor that Germany and Japan had newly established a kind of understanding. France has no interests in the Far East, but the French right-wing party feels that if the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia have disputes with Japan in the Pacific, France's position in Europe will not be shaken. France's diplomacy is very simple, and it does not have to worry about the unpredictable changes in the attitude of the United Kingdom all the time, and it does not have to feel the pressure of Soviet Russian communists, and it is not often left and right by the economic and diplomatic power of the United States. Japan also has a secret calculation for France, which is to absorb huge French capital into Manchuria. In the future, this capital may get the same result as the capital that France lent to Imperial Russia, in other words, it will be turned into nothing. But at least the Japanese can use this capital to develop the Northeast in front of them, and at the same time, they can use France in the Northeast to contain Russia and the United States. This wishful thinking unfortunately has some common interests with what the French right-wing party thinks, so after the September 18th Incident, when the French right-wing cabinet was in power, Japan secretly tried its best to propose a Franco-Japanese alliance, and also tried to persuade the French to establish a loan of one million francs, but both of them were not approved by the French left-wing party, so there was no result in the end. Recently, the French radical socialist party has lost power, and soon there will be news that the plan of a Franco-Japanese joint banking group to operate in Manchurian industries is about to be realized. We hope that this is just a remnant of the failure of Japan's large-scale loan to France, and we hope that French right-wing politicians will not fall into the trap of Japanese cunning.

<h3>Japanese Plan to Invade North China</h3>
<p>Reconnaissance and Surveying Begin to Take Action</p>
<p>Ultimate Goal to Occupy Tacheng</p>
<p>Troop Deployments Being Adjusted</p>
<p>Beijing News. The situation in North China has become increasingly dangerous. In fact, no one knows the specific details of the Japanese invasion policy and steps. According to the Mainland News Agency, they are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Invasion Policy</p>
<p>The Japanese divide their policy of invading North China into three steps: first, destroying the important places in North China, and second, deploying an encirclement.</p>

<h3>Important News from the Tangshan Labor Strike Regarding the Construction Industry</h3>
<p>Qixin Magnetic Factory in Tangshan has been selling various jars and bricks in Shanghai for many years, especially the 6-inch square red ones, which are the most popular. However, since the beginning of this year, labor strikes have been occurring frequently in Tangshan and other parts of North China, causing transportation difficulties. The strikes have become particularly severe in recent days, and it is feared that they will not be resolved in the short term. The existing stock of various jars and bricks in Shanghai is limited. In addition to urgently telegraphing Tangshan to immediately ship all manufactured goods to Shanghai to meet the urgent needs, we are also publishing this announcement to the construction and building industries, urging them to quickly come to negotiate to avoid delaying their projects.</p>
<p>General Manager: Hengda Foreign Company, Qixin Magnetic Factory Shanghai Office.</p>
<p>Address: 1st Floor, Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road. Telephone: 13544</p>
<p>Third, increasing latent forces: The first step has passed, namely the end of the battles at the various passes of the Great Wall. The second step is the increase of Japanese troops in the Malanyu and eastern Chahar's second and fourth districts. The third step is the expansion, organization, and supply of bandits in eastern Rehe and eastern Chahar, as well as the liaison between bandits in Hebei and Chahar provinces. Both steps have been gradually completed. Former intelligence personnel have now been ordered to cease activities, and the 1 million yuan monthly fund for intelligence activities by the Japanese embassy in North China has been abolished. An International Military Intelligence Department has been established. It is said that the fixed location of this department is in Tianjin, or some say in Peiping. It is divided into male and female groups. It is said that the leader of the male group is Tadatsugu Araki, and the leader of the female group is Yoshiko Kawashima. It is still impossible to find out who holds the position of the minister. In addition to the intelligence department, there is also a surveying and mapping agency, which seems to be directly under the jurisdiction of the Japanese garrison. The surveying and mapping work began in the winter of last year. The first surveying and mapping target was the Yellow River. The section from Luoyang to Kaifeng has been completed. The contents include: (1) the width of the river, (2) the depth of the riverbed, (3) the defensive terrain on both banks, (4) which section is suitable for crossing the river, and (5) an investigation of the current ships. The second surveying and mapping target is the route connecting Chahar-Mongolia and Xinjiang, and the shortcut connecting Suiyuan and Xinjiang. This work is currently underway. More than 20 radio stations have been set up from Rehe to western Mongolia, and short-wave radio stations are gradually increasing as the surveying and mapping team moves forward.</p>
<p>Current Objective</p>
<p>Although Japan is now actively making intimidating gestures of aggression towards North China, it is not actually in a hurry to encompass North China. This is probably the established policy of the Japanese military. However, recently, soldiers at home and abroad have been divided into two factions with different opinions. The domestic faction focuses on Russia and is unwilling to take any action until war is declared with Russia. The foreign faction is afraid that the time will be too late, creating an opportunity for military liaison between China and Russia. Therefore, they advocate establishing a second puppet regime in North China to divide China's internal strength, as well as political and military control in North China. It is still impossible to know which faction will ultimately prevail. There are rumors that Japan will help the puppet regime invade Peiping to build a fake capital, but this is purely speculation. Japan only has room to exploit the puppet regime and has no possibility of assisting it. It is clear that Japan does not want the puppet regime to gain strength. Therefore, its current objective, if the foreign military faction wins, is to establish a second puppet regime in North China; if the domestic military faction wins, it will temporarily abandon its ambition to invade and occupy North China.</p>
<p>Future Intentions</p>
<p>The actual purpose of Japan's current active westward advance is to occupy Tacheng in Xinjiang. It does not seem to have any plans for Chahar yet, but it is not without this ambition, just that the time is not ripe. Its intention to occupy Tacheng is to prevent the liaison between the extreme land forces of Soviet Russia on the one hand and to cut off the communication route between China and the Soviet Union on the other, avoiding the great taboo of being attacked from both sides. According to reliable information obtained by foreigners, the Japanese are preparing to achieve their goal over a period of one year. Various military deployments are also being coordinated, fully adopting a new organizational structure. Tank units and chemical warfare units are the backbone of the entire army, and cavalry will account for six-tenths of the main force. It is expected that the completion of this plan will be the time when the Russo-Japanese War breaks out. The current talk of a Russo-Japanese war is still far off.</p>

<h3>Legends of the Dalai Lama's Resurrection After Death</h3>
<p>| A Retrospective on the Dalai Lama's Death and the Events Surrounding It |</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reports that the 50 lamas sent by the Tibetan government to Nanjing to request the return of the Panchen Lama to Tibet boarded a ship in the Bay of Bengal yesterday to come to China. Meanwhile, a legend of the Dalai Lama's resurrection after death has suddenly arisen in the Kalimpong area. Although its truth or falsehood is yet to be determined, it is quite interesting. It is recorded below:</p>
<p>About a week before the Dalai Lama's death, the former abbot of Gaden Monastery went to Potala Palace to visit the Dalai Lama but was prevented by Gong Xierla, the Dalai Lama's trusted servant. At that time, the Dalai Lama was already suffering from a serious illness. Gong Xierla then informed the masses of a certain person who was believed to be possessed by the spirit of the god who protects Tibet and Buddhism. This person had been formally appointed by the Tibetan government to guide national affairs, both public and private. The medicine that Gong Xierla administered to the Dalai Lama was prescribed by this person. Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, the Dalai Lama's condition worsened. By December 16th, he was barely breathing. The former abbot of Gaden Monastery was summoned early in the morning, but by the time he arrived, the Dalai Lama had already left this world. Thereupon, the man recited prayers several times and prayed for the Dalai Lama's resurrection. Remarkably, the Dalai Lama actually regained consciousness and said in a faint voice to the former abbot that he should summon the prime minister and four key cabinet members. The prime minister was the Dalai Lama's nephew. It is believed that the Dalai Lama informed the former abbot about his reincarnation and instructed the prime minister on the handling of state affairs in his will. However, this conversation was extremely private, and no one knew about it except for those nearby attendants. It is said that after the Dalai Lama finished instructing, he ate a small amount of food. Shortly thereafter, he closed his eyes again and passed away in front of the prime minister and cabinet members. The next day, December 18th, a seven-week mourning period was officially announced, and singing and dancing were prohibited. All civilians were required to wear white, women were not allowed to wear jewelry, shops were closed, and all flags and banners were taken down. However, three weeks later, the aforementioned proclamation was rescinded. Shortly thereafter, the authorities ordered the arrest of Gong Xierla and three of his relatives. Upon hearing the news, his father fled in disguise with 50,000 rupees but was eventually arrested in Darjeeling and brought back to Lhasa for imprisonment. Gong Xierla was interrogated, and then the person possessed by the spirit was arrested and punished for prescribing the medicine improperly. However, the person attributed it to the mischief of the evil spirit Niyetrul and was spared further investigation. Niyetrul was a learned lama who was known for his loyalty to the central government during his lifetime. When the Tibetan troops invaded the east, he was imprisoned in Darjeeling and committed suicide out of resentment. Before dying, he said that he would make the Dalai Lama uneasy in his position after becoming a ghost because the Dalai Lama had ordered his imprisonment. Gong Xierla was also spared prosecution, but he was sentenced to life imprisonment in a certain temple for concealing the Dalai Lama's illness. His property was confiscated by the Tibetan government. A certain person in charge of the Lhatreng Monastery, aged twenty-three, was promoted to regent on February 15th of this year, in accordance with tradition. The procedure is as follows: the surnames of several candidates for regent are written on paper, sealed in wax balls, and placed in a golden cup, covered with silk. A religious ceremony is performed in front of a certain deity. Then, the silk is removed, and the wax balls are poured onto a table in front of the deity. The one that is closest to the deity is selected. If several balls are the same distance away, the one on the right is selected. It is said that the entire Tibetan people have great love and respect for the regent. The Dalai Lama also greatly respected him during his lifetime. It is said that the man possesses magical powers. Recently, there have been rumors that the Dalai Lama has been reincarnated in a certain place, but this statement is actually incorrect.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu Leaves Peiping to Go South</h3>
<p>First Visit Chiang in Jiangxi, Then Meet Wang in Nanjing</p>
<p>Political Affairs Handled by Chief Secretary He Qigong</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee, departed from Peiping West Station at 5:30 p.m. today (3rd) for Hankou. Accompanying him were Advisor Ge Jingyou, Secretary He Jiecai, Assistant Secretary Wang Dagang, staff member Gao Renjian, and several guards. Mrs. Huang is scheduled to take the Peiping-Shanghai train to Shanghai on the 4th. It is said that Huang plans to return to Peiping in two months. The special train will arrive in Hankou at 3:00 a.m. on the 5th to meet with Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Qun. He will then take a warship to Jiujiang and transfer to the Nanxun Road to Nanchang to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He will then go to Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Lin and meet with President Wang Jingwei. After that, he will go to Shanghai and spend a considerable period of time there before returning to Mogan Mountain for a visit, and then return to Peiping. After Huang leaves Peiping, the routine affairs of the Political Reorganization Committee will still be handled by Chief Secretary He Qigong. As for Huang's mission to the south, it is nothing more than discussing diplomacy with Japan and seeking stability in North China.</p>
<p>Huang's special train was prepared by the Peining Railway Bureau two weeks ago and parked at the East Station. It consisted of one covered freight car, one first-class compartment car, one first-class lounge car, one third-class sleeper car, one passenger car, and one guard car. At 1:00 p.m. today, it was ordered to move from the station to Fengtai. Then, it was ordered to switch tracks to the Peiping-Hankou Line and arrive at the West Station via Guang'anmen and the West Gate for standby. At 4:30 p.m., he went to the West Station. Those who saw him off included Gao Shengyue, representing He Yingqin, Mayor of Peiping Yuan Liang, Police Chief Yu Jinhe, and more than 50 other people. Huang arrived at the West Station by car at 5:15 p.m. After boarding the train, the special train departed. When Huang arrived at the station, the security was very tight, with soldiers and police densely deployed.</p>
<p>Huang's trip to the south was extremely secretive. At 2:00 p.m. today, Huang had already left the Diplomatic Building and first went to Jurentang to visit He Yingqin to bid farewell. At 3:00 p.m., he went to Xishengping Garden to bathe and temporarily invited Peiping Mayor Yuan Liang by telephone for a conversation. He then took a car to the station and boarded the No. 264 flower car. He summoned Yuan Liang and Shen Yi for a private conversation. When reporters also presented their cards requesting to see him, Huang, standing at the car door, said that he was going south for about five or six weeks, first to Nanchang to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and then to Nanjing to visit President Wang. After finishing his business, he would return to his ancestral home in Zhejiang to sweep the tombs. According to Secretary-General He Qigong, Huang will first go to Hankou, then to Nanchang to visit Chiang, and then to Nanjing to meet with President Wang to report on the political and diplomatic situation in North China. He will then return to his hometown in Mogan Mountain to sweep the tombs and will not be able to return to Peiping for about forty days. He only telegraphed the Executive Yuan in advance to report and did not ask for leave (3rd).</p>
<h3>Chiang Issues General Order to Ten Provinces to Rectify Officialdom</h3>
<p>Those Who Violate the Law Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Do Not Lightly Dismiss Them</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Nanchang Headquarters has recently issued a general order to the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces to rectify officialdom. The original order states [Now that the country is facing a serious national crisis, after the careful selection and appointment of administrative officials at all levels, they should be granted a longer term of office and strict responsibilities so that they can gradually implement all important policies without the mindset of a five-day magistrate. For incidents that warrant punishment, they should be given reprimands, demerits, salary deductions, and demotions, depending on the severity of the circumstances. They should not be lightly dismissed, lest cunning people take advantage of minor offenses to evade their responsibilities. If there is serious illegal behavior, they should be imprisoned or executed accordingly, and should not be dismissed lightly to comply with the ancient principle of using heavy penalties in times of disorder. This is the most effective method to curb corruption and negligence and to protect the virtuous and capable. The key to clarifying officialdom and increasing efficiency lies entirely in this. At this time, when the declining trend is prevalent and the country is facing a serious crisis, it is especially necessary to rigorously implement the aforementioned various punishments and not to lightly dismiss them, otherwise it will be impossible to revive the country. I hope that the administrative heads of each province and party will deeply understand this meaning and conscientiously implement it. In addition to issuing separate orders, I hereby order the provincial governments to comply and instruct their subordinates to be informed. This order is issued by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek] (April 4th)</p>
<h3>Liu's Bandits Flee Into Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Ganyu County Seat Has Been Occupied</p>
<p>Wang Jun Dispatches Troops to Encircle and Suppress</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After Liu Guitang's bandit gang fled back into Shandong province, they were attacked by Sun Tongxuan, Gu Liangmin, and other troops dispatched by Han Fuju. The bandits, having been on the run for a long time and exhausted, would collapse without a fight when faced with a large-scale military suppression. However, the bandits were mostly natives of eastern Shandong, familiar with the geography, and their movements were extremely unpredictable. They have recently fled south from Yishui into Jiangsu. The Jinpu Garrison Command received a telegram from Han Fuju reporting this. Wang Jun immediately dispatched the 19th Brigade, led by Li Shilong, stationed in Xuzhou, to take two trains east yesterday morning to defend the Xin'an Town area. Then, he received news that Liu's bandits had fled into Ganyu, a county under the jurisdiction of Hai Prefecture. Wang Jun again dispatched the 21st Brigade, led by Li Wenbin, stationed in Bengbu, to take two trains east last night to assist in the defense. In the evening, news came from the front that about 800 of Liu's bandits had surrounded Ganyu County Seat. Wang Jun immediately ordered Li Shilong's troops to advance rapidly towards Qingkou from the Caopu and Baitabu stations. This morning (4th), news was received that the bandits had captured Ganyu County Seat. Wang then led the chief of the staff section Su Ziwen, aide-de-camp Zhou Chuanduo, and telegraph operators and guards to the east on a special train at 12:00 noon to supervise the suppression between Xin'an and Xinpu. Ganyu is located in the northernmost part of the four counties under the jurisdiction of Hai Prefecture, adjacent to Shandong province. Qingkou is south of Ganyu County Seat, and Xinpu is south of Qingkou. After the bandits entered Ganyu County Seat, major stores and financial institutions in Qingkou moved their important items to Xinpu. The 7th Division troops were deployed north of the Longhai Line, and armored trains patrolled between Xuzhou and Haizhou. Before departing, Wang Jun told reporters at the station, "Li's brigade will be able to pass Qingkou this afternoon. If Liu's bandits stay in the city, they will definitely be surrounded and resolved. However, the bandits' intention is to loot money, not to occupy the land. I am afraid that once our troops arrive, they will flee again. I have telegraphed Han and Fang to ask them to dispatch troops to track and pursue. The Shandong army will attack from north to south, and our army will attack from south to north. The two sides will attack from both sides, and they will definitely be annihilated. It is heard that the Shandong army is deployed on the Shandong border, and it is not easy for the bandits to flee back. They will inevitably flow into Jiangsu province. Therefore, in addition to sending a part of the army to Ganyu this year, we will still pay attention to the interception of bandits flowing along the Longhai Line to prevent the bandits from crossing the line and causing serious trouble to the local area." Dong Yaotang, director of the Longhai Road Office in Xuzhou, also took a car to Xin'an this morning to facilitate the coordination of train and military transportation. As for the bandits entering Ganyu County Seat, they have looted extensively. As of this evening, there is no news of their withdrawal. The extent of the losses and whether there are any kidnappings are not yet known. There are not many garrison troops in Hai Prefecture, and local police forces are all guarding their respective areas. Tongshan and the counties east of Xuzhou have also dispatched police teams to defend the borders, coupled with the suppression by the large army, the bandits may not cross the line and flee south. (4th)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice Sends Personnel to Inspect Prison Administration</p>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration is organizing the national prisons, first conducting inspections to provide a basis for improvement. Zhou Zhenzuo, a technician from the ministry, and Wang Yuanzeng, director of the Prison Department, arrived in Songjiang today to inspect the equipment of the court prison and detention center. At noon, County Magistrate Jin hosted a banquet at the county government to welcome them and inquired in detail about the judicial situation in the county. It is heard that Zhou and Wang will leave for Jinshan and other counties tomorrow for inspection. After completing their work, they will return to the capital to report.</p>
<p>The Seventh Aunt of Baolian is Re-coffined</p>
<p>Shi Tao Hai, the son of the manager of the Songjiang Salt Office, redeemed the body of Baolian's seventh aunt from the Shanghai Xiaohua Garden brothel and married her as a concubine, hiding her in a golden house. However, just three days later, a tragic murder occurred. After the procuratorate verified the cause of death, it ordered the undertaker to prepare a coffin and collect the body. Later, the pimp learned of this and notified the deceased's family in Yixing. Yesterday, together with the seventh aunt's sister, they filed a lawsuit with the court to claim the coffin and belongings. The seventh aunt's sister felt that the coffining was inadequate. The pimp also cried sadly and negotiated with the Shi family to transport the coffin to the Haoyuan Cemetery, purchase a top-grade coffin and burial clothes, and re-coffin the body, spending about 300 yuan. The body is temporarily placed in the cemetery for selection of a burial site.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Narcotics Seized at the Station</p>
<p>The stationmaster of the Suzhou station on the Jinpu Railway seized four large boxes of raw materials for making narcotic pills, weighing over 500 catties, from passengers Jiang Jingsheng and Jin Zhiyuan on a passenger train from Shanghai on the 31st of last month. It is said that they were sent to the Renji Pharmacy in Suzhou City for receipt. The raw materials were sent to the Fuyin Hospital outside the Qimen gate for testing, and the passengers were detained at the station. However, because the Fuyin Hospital did not have a testing room, the original items were returned to the station. This matter was discovered by Liu Hong, a patrol officer of the third section of the Suzhou station police. He took the raw materials for the narcotic pills and the two passengers to the police station and reported to the police departments and management bureaus of both railways. Yesterday (5th), a reply telegram was received ordering the transfer of the raw materials to Shanghai for testing.</p>
<h3>A Traveler Commits Suicide in the Su Tai Inn</h3>
<p>A traveler named Wang Huiyu, a native of Ningbo, aged 27, came to the Lao Su Tai Inn outside the gate on the 27th of last month with his wife Liu Caiyun, his five-year-old son, and a suitcase. He booked room No. 50. On the 30th, he moved to room No. 28. The day before yesterday (4th), the couple took their son out in the afternoon. At 4:00 p.m., Wang Huiyu returned to the inn alone before his wife. At 6:00 p.m., Liu and her son returned and found the door locked. They shouted and knocked loudly. After a long time, a voice inside responded and opened the door. The waiter Wu Yongshan knew something was wrong and went inside to investigate. He found a bottle of Anshe medicine and two letters beside the pillow, indicating that he had taken poison. He immediately reported to the police officer and sent him to the Suyong Hospital for treatment. He is currently conscious. His family is still staying at the inn. When a reporter visited him yesterday morning, Wang refused to speak. However, it is known that Wang lived in Hongkou, Shanghai, and worked at the Gold and Silver Exchange. Due to business failure and difficult living conditions, he came to Suzhou to ask his brother-in-law (currently a military supply officer in the 88th Division) for help but failed. Therefore, he committed suicide.</p>

<h3>Second Labor Strike Occurs at Qingfeng</h3>
<p>The Qingfeng Yarn Factory in Zhoushan浜, due to improving work efficiency, replaced the male workers in the original steel-wire station with female workers. The laid-off male workers were reassigned to miscellaneous jobs. The workers expressed their dissatisfaction, causing a huge strike on the 21st of last month. After the party and government summoned all relevant parties and negotiated eight principles for mediation, the workers resumed work first, and then elected Xu Yongji, Yang Hanxi, Cheng Jingtang, and Chen Xiangchun to be responsible for the review in order to thoroughly resolve the issue. The county government sent a letter to each reviewer, scheduling a meeting for the review. Unexpectedly, the female workers in the weaving machine room had a conflict over the issue of fines at 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (4th), resulting in the destruction of the cloth inspection platform and windows in the cloth inspection room, and the books of fines were also torn up. Tang Guizhen and Zhu Huifen, female workers in the cloth inspection room, and Yang Zhemin, a male worker, were slightly injured. Wang Zhizhi, an employee of the cloth inspection room, was also hit by a copper pipe by the workers. At that time, the order was chaotic. After 6:00 p.m., more than 290 female workers in the weaving machine room all left the factory gate. Then, they gathered to discuss the matter. Yesterday, they brought along the spinning workers and also stopped working. Tang Xinghai, the factory director, immediately reported the situation to the county government and requested assistance in maintaining order. The workers, represented by female worker leaders Xu Axiu, Xu Lindi, Ge Aiyuan, Wang Xiaomei, Fan Xiaoying, and Zheng Qiaoyun, also reported to the county government through the labor union, claiming that the workers would be willing to have their wages deducted if their work was inferior. However, they should not be held responsible for issues such as yellow water, black spots, and uneven thickness, loose weave, etc., or if there was coal ash in the factory, or if the raw materials were not good, or if the machinery was too old. They proposed three conditions: (1) unanimously oppose female cloth inspectors, (2) refuse a certain employee of the cloth inspection room, Ding, to enter the factory again in the future, and (3) the reduction of wages should not exceed four points at most. The factory stated that, according to the cloth woven by female workers last year, 80 out of every 100 pieces could be considered A-grade (Double Fish), with only 20 pieces being considered B-grade (Cowherd). This year, only 40 out of every 100 pieces can be considered A-grade, with the rest having defects. Therefore, it is necessary to be more serious about the work. As for rewards, a total of 104 yuan and eight jiao in cloth weaving rewards and 332 yuan and one jiao and nine fen in material rewards were given in March. However, a strike still occurred, which is unfortunate. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the workers gathered at the labor union and then braved the rain to petition the county party headquarters and the county government, stating their difficulties in person. County Magistrate Yan received them and ordered them to resume work first and wait for a resolution after convening a meeting with the party headquarters.</p>

<h3>Incestuous Relationship Between Aunt and Nephew-in-Law Causes Murder</h3>
<p>A floating corpse was discovered in Dongqiaodi, Qinglian Township, the 16th District of Wuyi County, on the morning of the 5th. Wang Jun, the acting township head of the township, reported the incident to the district office, requesting that it be forwarded to the county prosecutor's office to send someone to conduct an autopsy. Zhou Weizhu and Zhou Weiyin from the township reported that their brother, Zhou Weisi, had suddenly disappeared. They requested Township Head Wang to accompany them to inspect the floating corpse. They saw that the deceased was indeed their brother, Weisi. Township Head Wang then inquired with the deceased's mother, Zhou Wei, who learned that the brothers had been arguing over property and that an incestuous relationship had occurred between her daughter-in-law and her nephew-in-law, resulting in Weisi being killed by Zhou Li and Zhou Ruilin. However, Zhou Li and Zhou Ruilin had already fled. Township Head Wang believed that the case involved murder and immediately dispatched the security team to investigate. They arrested the two in Qiuzhuang Village. He waited for Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongxi to come to the township for an autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that he had been strangled to death with a rope and thrown into the river. He ordered the family to collect the body and scheduled a hearing at the court on the 5th for all parties involved in the case. The criminals arrested by the security team were also sent to the court on the 5th for questioning.</p>

<h3>Conflict Between Militia and Farmers Causes Bloodshed</h3>
<p>A conflict occurred between the security team of the Fifth District and farmers in Xiangjiaqiao over the collection of land donations. The team members opened fire, killing and injuring many men and women, inciting public outrage. Liu Jinshan, the team member who caused the incident, was arrested and sent to the court. After the prosecutor's investigation, he was prosecuted with the death penalty. The criminal court scheduled the trial for the 17th.</p>
<h3>Local Court Scheduled to Be Established</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate civil and criminal litigation for parties in counties such as Ruhai, Taizhou, and Jingjiang in northern Jiangsu, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has ordered the Nantong County Court to be upgraded and reorganized into a local court. Preparations are underway, and it is scheduled to be established on July 1st.</p>

<h3>Affair Leads to Wife's Murder</h3>
<p>Liu Shizhen, the deputy head of Jibin Town in the Sixth District, who is over thirty years old, married Chen Jinrong's daughter through a matchmaker in the past. They were initially on good terms, but later Liu began an affair with Xu Degang's eldest daughter, Muying. This led to frequent quarrels between the couple. The day before yesterday (2nd), one of Liu's small boxes suddenly disappeared, containing photos of Liu and Muying together. Suspecting that Chen had stolen it, he beat Chen severely with a wooden stick three times, causing injuries all over her body and making her moan in pain. That night, he strangled Chen to death with a rope. The next day, he hastily coffined and buried her to cover up the traces. The wife's family was weak and kind, and had not yet reported the case.</p>
<h3>The High Court Sends Personnel to Re-examine the Gong Xueqing Case</h3>
<p>Gong Xueqing, the adopted daughter-in-law of Gu Falin in Shijia Town in the First District, suddenly died in February. The family of the deceased reported to the county for an autopsy. Deng, the trial judge, went to conduct the autopsy. The family of the deceased forcibly tried to force Deng to conclude that she had died from fatigue but failed. They surrounded and insulted Deng. Later, County Magistrate Zhang led the police to re-examine the body and found scars on her waist and back and rope marks on her neck. However, it remained to be proven whether she had been strangled. Last month, the county government arrested and questioned the main culprits, Gong Huangshi and Gong Hongyuan. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper twice. Later, Gong Huangshi, the family of the deceased, submitted a request to the county government to forward to the High Court for a re-examination. Xuan Zhiming, a forensic official from the High Court, arrived in Haimen in February. Yesterday (3rd), he opened the coffin at the Doutian Temple in the county seat and city to conduct a re-examination. The re-examination found whip marks on the upper right back of the deceased, rope marks on the neck from the root of the right ear to the jaw, an abrasion on the chest, and cyanosis on both fingernails. He concluded that she had hanged herself after being injured. His reasons were: 1. The rope marks ran from the root of the right ear to the jaw, while there were no rope marks on the left side. This was because her feet were off the ground when she hanged herself, her head tilted to the right, and the center of gravity shifted to the right. 2. The fingernails were cyanotic, which was because the body was hanging down during the suicide, and the blood congealed there. After the examination, the coffin was handed over to the town security to guard, pending a final decision before burial.</p>

<h3>Great Fire in Yuanfu Lane</h3>
<p>This morning (the 5th) around 2:00 AM, a fire broke out at the Fangzheng Tea House warehouse, number 20 Yuanfu Lane, Hangzhou, due to the stored lime getting wet. The fire quickly became intense and was extinguished after burning for an hour. Several thousand catties of stored tea leaves and the entire warehouse were destroyed, with losses estimated at over 30,000 yuan. Fortunately, the fire did not spread to neighboring houses due to the tall surrounding walls of the warehouse.</p>

<h3>Ban on "Upside-Down Seven" Opera Leads to Police Injury</h3>
<p>Since the Spring Festival, "Upside-Down Seven" operas (i.e., lewd and local operas) have been widely performed in urban and rural areas of Hefei. Initially, they were performed secretly, but now they are blatantly setting up stages, hiring female performers, and attracting customers, almost emptying the streets. On the 31st, Wu Jiatang and others performed with hired female performers behind the Great King Temple in the east suburbs, attracting over ten thousand spectators. Wang Jifu, a patrol officer from the East Suburbs Public Security Bureau, deemed the opera detrimental to public order and banned its performance, but his orders were ignored. That evening, the opera was staged with even greater fanfare. Wang led police to the scene and arrested seven male performers, including Chen Gongyu, Wang Shihe, and He Daoming, along with their gongs, drums, costumes, etc. However, the opera organizer led a crowd to the scene, and they attacked the police officers Ge Shihai and Wu Yugui, injuring their heads and causing them to bleed profusely. A rifle was seized and broken, and a rifle bolt was lost. Three of the opera performers were taken away by the crowd. Patrol Officer Wang then sent Chen Gongyu, He Daoming, Dai Wenchuan, and Wang Shihe to the Public Security Section for interrogation and treatment, while the injured police officers were taken to Mengjiu Hospital for treatment. The Public Security Section has reported the case to the county government and plans to arrest the opera organizer for punishment.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>No Reports Received on Tense Situation in North China</p>
<p>Ban Hong Incident Due to Deliberate Provocation</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Increased Compared to Previous Years, No Foreign Debt Incurred</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, left Nanjing by overnight train at 11:00 PM the night before and arrived at Zhenru at 7:20 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on West Aiham Road to rest. Reporters from various newspapers visited Kong at his private residence yesterday afternoon and were received. He issued a written statement, which is detailed below:</p>
<p>Situation in North China Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, there have been rumors that the situation in North China is tense, and that Chairman Huang Fu unexpectedly went south at this time, and that President Wang and ministers were said to be flying to Jiangxi. What is the truth? (Answer) There are frequent messengers traveling to and from North China. I have not received any emergency reports personally, and the situation is the same as before. As for the rumors, I heard that they were caused by the remarks of Commissioner Zhang Puquan. In reality, the whole world and the entire country are in an emergency situation. Commissioner Zhang's intention was probably to prevent the people of the country from having a five-minute heat and indulging in pleasure, so he shouted loudly to awaken the people of the country and strengthen their patriotic hearts. As for Chairman Huang's going south, it is to report on his work and there is no other reason. Chairman Huang is usually a responsible person. Outside rumors say that he abandoned his post and returned south due to the emergency in North China. This is definitely not the case. There is no emergency news in North China. If there were, Chairman Huang, being a responsible person, would never try to avoid danger. As for whether President Wang will fly to Jiangxi, I have not heard of it. In short, Chairman Chiang is a member of the Central Political Council, and the authorities naturally need to meet and discuss important central issues. During the period of suppression, he is not convenient to leave the army. When necessary, the authorities will go to Jiangxi to discuss matters in person, which is normal. Outsiders do not understand and make many speculations, which is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Ban Hong is a Misinformation of Ban Nong</p>
<p>(Question) Reports say that the Yunnan border is alarmed. What is the truth? (Answer) The rumored Ban Hong incident, as far as I know, is a mistake for Ban Nong. Ban Hong is our country's territory, while Ban Nong does not belong to our country. China and Britain have always had harmonious relations. Britain has always had the style of a great power and would not use force to invade our country's territory. The rumors are either based on misinformation and exaggerated, or someone is deliberately provoking and slandering Sino-British relations. I hope the people of the country will pay attention.</p>
<p>There is No Such Thing as Foreign Loans</p>
<p>(Question) There are rumors that a foreign banking group has lent a large sum of money to our country. What is the truth? (Answer) Borrowing foreign loans is a matter under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. As the Minister of Finance, I have never heard of this matter. However, I recently heard that our banking industry plans to organize a silver company to facilitate foreign investment in our country's construction projects in the future. This matter may be based on this misinformation. Examining the use of foreign capital to develop industry is originally advocated by the late Premier. I believe that borrowing money for construction should belong to a truly profitable production industry, which can be used to repay the principal and interest in the future, and not like the indiscriminate borrowing and abuse of the former Peking government, which has led to the inability to repay until now, increasing the burden on the people and damaging the country's reputation. Instead of borrowing money like this, it is better to save and tighten spending and not borrow money. As for national debt, I have long had the intention of reorganizing it, but we must seek a solution slowly and cannot rely on foreign loans. Seeing that the world economy is still in a depression, countries are raising debts and raising funds from their own people. The British and American governments even have proposals to prohibit other countries from borrowing in their countries. Under such circumstances, even if China intends to borrow foreign debt, foreigners may not be able to invest.</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Increased Compared to Previous Years</p>
<p>(Question) How is the financial situation recently? (Answer) The tax revenue has been very good recently and has increased compared to the previous month. When I took office as the Minister of Finance, I showed the people of the country the way to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Recently, the outside world only knows about increasing revenue, but does not know about the actual situation. Now the military and political authorities are actively working hard on reducing expenditure, hoping to achieve the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure in the short term.</p>
<p>Southwest Cooperation Can Be Realized</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, there have been reports about the issue of cooperation between the central government and the southwest. What is the truth? (Answer) Recently, there have been frequent messengers between the central government and the Guangdong side. Now, the comrades in the southwest have realized the deepening of internal and external troubles and that only unity can save the country. Cooperation is expected to be realized. This is truly a blessing for the country, because those who talk about saving the country but cannot sacrifice their prejudices and only sing high tunes, forcing others to agree with me, will only harm and mislead the country. We will not wait for others to destroy us, but we will destroy ourselves.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Association in Shanghai Telegraphs Request to Demarcate Borders</h3>
<p>For the British Army Occupying Ban Hong</p>
<p>Please Request the Government to Protest Severely</p>
<p>Since the British occupied Ban Hong in Yunnan Province, the Yunnan Association in Shanghai has been extremely angry. They held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the Association Hall on Baker Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than ten people including Zhang Yaozeng, Lu Zhiyi, Zhao Zhi, etc. attended. Zhang Yaozeng chaired the meeting and Zhao Zhi recorded it. First, the chairman reported on the important truth of the British army's invasion of Yunnan and the significance of holding the meeting. Then, Zhao Yunyan, who had been sent by the Yunnan Provincial Government to conduct an on-site inspection of the Yunnan-Burma border, attended the meeting and reported in detail on the causes and consequences of the Yunnan-Burma border negotiations. The meeting then decided to respond to the proposal of the Association in Beijing to unite with associations in various provinces and cities to protest together, and to telegraph the National Government and the Yunnan Provincial Government to lodge a serious protest with the British government, demarcate the borders, and strive to strengthen national defense in order to be prepared for emergencies. The original telegram is excerpted as follows: National Government and Yunnan Provincial Government: Since the British army occupied Ban Hong, it has been many days. Although the people of Yunnan have unanimously opposed it, the British have not shown any remorse. Such open aggression is related to the national territory. How can our government not severely stop it and deal with it carefully? The opinion of our association is that first, we should lodge a serious protest with the British government, order the British army to quickly withdraw to its original defense, and stop all construction work on bridges and roads, so that the Ban Hong area can completely restore its original state. Second, the British occupation of Ban Hong, although it has other intentions, the uncertain border is the cause of the disaster. We should take this opportunity to propose that the governments of the two countries each send senior officials to impartially survey the border, and measure one by one the places that were once regarded as disputed areas, so that there will be no ambiguity between this boundary and that boundary, so that disputes can be permanently prevented. Third, the Yunnan-Burma border is intertwined, and the national defense boundary cannot be ignored. The sage Yang Yiqing said that when there is nothing, we should be prepared for something, and when there is something, we should be calm as if there is nothing. These words are enough for people to follow today. We should ask the government to quickly rectify the border of Yunnan Province and strive to strengthen it, and not delay any longer, so that we can be prepared for emergencies. The above three points are related to safety and dare not be silent. The situation is urgent, and we hope for a decisive action. This is fortunate for Yunnan and fortunate for the country. Yunnan Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu is Coming to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador in Shanghai Waits to Meet Huang</p>
<p>Then Returns to Tokyo to Plan Countermeasures</p>
<p>Huang Fu, Chairman of the Peking Political Affairs Committee, is going south to Jiangxi this time to meet Chairman Chiang and report on the situation in North China and discuss response measures. It is said that Huang will go to Nanjing after meeting Chiang to meet with President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei, and then come to Shanghai. Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira went to Hangzhou for sightseeing and returned to Shanghai the night before. He will meet with Huang in Shanghai and then return to Tokyo to listen to the instructions of Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and plan new diplomatic strategies toward China.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Pays Attention to Fishery Companies</h3>
<p>Treacherous Merchants Are Induced to Sell Inferior Goods</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the January 28th Incident, the fishery merchants in this city have automatically inspected inferior goods. However, recently, a certain country's nationals, seeing that this movement in our country is not as enthusiastic as in the past, have induced treacherous merchants to organize a fishery company in name, with Chinese people coming forward, but actually all controlled by nationals of that country, so that they can sell inferior goods. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has paid special attention to this matter and has instructed the subordinate fishery organs to conduct a thorough investigation. Regarding the organization of fishery companies, the government should be very careful in issuing licenses. If such incidents are found in order to deceive, they will be severely investigated.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Central Government Requesting Discussion of Cigarette Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Forty Chinese Cigarette Factories Are on the Brink of Ruin</p>
<p>Livelihood of Hundreds of Thousands of Tobacco Farmers is Severed</p>
<p>Since the cigarette unified tax was changed to the new tax rate, Chinese cigarette factories have been greatly affected due to the unequal treatment of upper and lower cigarettes. After repeated meetings and discussions, they submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to organize a committee to publicly discuss the matter, but this has not been implemented. Recently, because the factories can no longer bear the burden of this unfair tax rate, they sent a letter to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday, requesting that it be forwarded to the central government ministries and departments to implement it as soon as possible. The original text of the letter is as follows: Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Tax Department: Recently, we received a joint letter from Shanghai Minzhong Cigarette Company and other forty cigarette companies, stating that the current cigarette taxes are unequal in terms of high and low tax rates, and requesting that the Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Tax Department, and Shanghai Cigarette Factory Industry Association each select members to publicly discuss revising the cigarette tax rates. The original text, except for the direct submission by the cigarette companies, is omitted here. The letter ends with the statement that after the Minzhong and other cigarette companies jointly submitted the request for revision, the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Department had previously issued a letter to the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Industry Association, which was forwarded to the members' meeting for discussion, and a decision was made to prepare a written opinion and reply to the Tax Department. However, a month has passed and no instructions have been received. The merchants can no longer endure the unequal tax rates and have jointly requested your association to unanimously request, etc. In view of this, we find that the current cigarette tax rates are light for upper cigarettes and heavy for lower cigarettes, and the high and low treatments are indeed unfair. Moreover, the tobacco leaves for upper cigarettes mostly come from overseas, and the operation is mostly done by foreign merchants. The tobacco leaves for lower cigarettes are mostly produced locally, and the operation is mostly done by Chinese people. If we follow the principle of protecting taxes, we should levy heavy taxes on upper cigarettes and light taxes on lower cigarettes. Even if we do not do this, we should treat them equally so that Chinese merchants and foreign merchants have the possibility of competition. According to what the merchants said, during the seven-tier system of cigarette tax, there were as many as 150 or 160 Chinese cigarette factories, and the annual sales of tobacco leaves in several counties such as Susong reached nearly 400,000 bags. Since the quota was changed to three tiers, and then from three tiers to two tiers, Chinese cigarette factories have gradually closed down. Today, there are only forty or fifty remaining. The sales of tobacco leaves in Susong and other counties have also gradually decreased, with annual sales of only about 100,000 bags. Since the implementation of the new two-tier system at the end of last year, cigarette merchants have been the first to bear the brunt, and these forty or fifty factories are also in danger. Tobacco farmers are also indirectly harmed and will be left to die. Moreover, if the previous seven-tier system is restored, tax revenue can be greatly increased, while with the current two-tier system, tax revenue is reduced. The statements are very detailed and are all facts. This is especially important for the national economy and people's livelihood and is not only about the interests of Chinese and foreign merchants. Our government should pay special attention to it. Based on the above, we have attached the letter and telegraphed it to your departments for review and approval. We earnestly request that the Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Tax Department, and Shanghai Cigarette Factory Industry Association each send representatives to organize a cigarette tax rate discussion committee to publicly discuss the matter, either restoring the seven-tier system or collecting taxes based on value, so as to be fair and benefit the people's livelihood. Attached are two documents. National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association Sent Two Sets of Election Ballots</h3>
<p>Commercial Group: 182 Ballots</p>
<p>Native-Place Group: 165 Ballots</p>
<p>The 13th election of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, for the Commercial and Native-Place groups, sent out election ballots at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from all sectors came to inspect and supervise the distribution of the ballots. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 13th election ballots were distributed, and the following representatives were present: Zhu Wenqi from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mao Heyuan from the Ningbo Native-Place Association, Lin Kanghou from the Banking Association, Zhang Yichen from the Citizens' Federation, Wu Rulin from the Money Industry Association, Qian Youlan from the Shaoxing Seven Counties Native-Place Association, and Xu Jizi, Wang Hanliang, Hu Fengxiang, and other representatives, more than ten in total.</p>
<p>Issuing Election Ballots</p>
<p>Each election of the Association is divided into three groups, with each group electing 27 representatives, for a total of 81 representatives. The 81 representatives then mutually elect the executive committee members of the Association and the Chinese directors and committee members of the Municipal Council to participate in various administrative matters. The Citizens' Group of this election has already been elected on March 27. The Commercial and Native-Place groups sent out election ballots yesterday and are scheduled to vote on April 9 and count the ballots on April 10. After the above representatives are elected, a date will be set for mutually electing the executive committee members and Chinese directors and committee members.</p>
<p>Investigation Report</p>
<p>The election report of the 13th group of the Association states: In the election of this group, 93 investigation forms were received from commercial groups, of which 4 forms only nominated 1 person. Therefore, there were a total of 182 people. The election roster is numbered 182, and 182 election ballots were issued, matching the above number. 86 investigation forms were received from native-place groups, of which 5 forms only nominated 1 person. Therefore, there were a total of 167 people. The draft number of the election roster is 167. However, after the roster was compiled, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District was suddenly allowed to open the names and addresses of the branches as a basis. Because the 13th District Branch was not listed, the investigation form of the Association was returned. Therefore, there were only 165 people in total. The official number of the election roster is 165, and only 165 election ballots were issued. Joint statement, April 5, 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Statement from Property Owners</h3>
<p>Last Year's Water Bill Ratio to Rent</p>
<p>Highest at Over 20%</p>
<p>Municipal Council's Information Is Inaccurate</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Municipal Council of the International Settlement issued a news item about water bills yesterday, stating that half of last year's water bills were slightly more than 7.5% of the rent, and half were slightly less than 7.5%. In order to clarify the facts, the reporter inquired with the relevant property owners and was told that this year's water bill has been implemented since April 1. Although it is said that the bill is collected at an 80% discount, since it has not been a month, the water value has not yet been paid. Therefore, whether it is cheaper or increased compared to last year is not yet known. As for the report that last year's water bill was between 7.5% of the rent, this is not accurate. Because in the past, when the water bill was included in the rent, it was paid at 7.5% of the rent. Later, the water company suffered heavy losses when paying 7.5%. It was changed to 10%. Later, due to the rising gold price, the water company changed to the current system (water meter system) in order to increase revenue. In the central area of the International Settlement, because the rent is high, after changing to the water meter system, the water bill is about 7.5% of the rent, and there is no loss. It is still cheaper to calculate at 10%, so there are fewer disputes. The Hongkou District is a labor area, and the rent is low. After changing to the water meter system, the water bill has increased sharply, exceeding 20% of the rent at the highest point, and usually between 15% of the rent. Therefore, disputes have occurred repeatedly. It is completely wrong to say that the water bill borne by ordinary people is within 7.5%. Moreover, there are resolutions from the Real Estate Association that can be checked when mediating disputes and cannot be ignored. The situation described today is not worth a smile from knowledgeable people.</p>

<h3>Social Bureau Sets Today to Mediate Customs Brokerage Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Workers Arrested, Union Rescues</p>
<p>Union Reports Causes of Labor Dispute</p>
<p>After the Customs Brokerage workers went on strike due to the Tianjin gang customs brokers destroying the cartage precedents, the Social Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate in detail and summoned both labor and management, strictly ordering the Customs Brokerage Association to be responsible for issuing cartage according to the precedents. Today at 2:00 PM, the Customs Brokerage Union and the Customs Brokerage Association will be summoned again for mediation. At the same time, the Municipal Party Department has been asked to send personnel to assist.</p>
<h3>Union Asks for Release of Arrested Workers</h3>
<p>The strike committee organized by the union found that Gongtai Customs Brokerage was destroying cartage and, during the strike, changed the customs declaration of Tianjin gang goods to Qingdao for transshipment. They sent investigators to persuade them, but it was ineffective. At 12:00 PM yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to arrest Cheng Pinshun, a worker of the union. It is said that it was to assist the request of the concession police and temporarily detain him in the Public Security Bureau. All the customs brokerage workers were very angry at the Public Security Bureau for arresting workers. The directors and supervisors of the union were deeply afraid of a major disturbance. In addition to advising the workers, they also sent directors to the Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Department to petition for rescue. It is reported that the Municipal Party Department and other departments notified the Public Security Bureau to release the workers because the matter belonged to a labor-management dispute.</p>
<p>Association Reports the Crux of the Dispute</p>
<p>The Transshipment Customs Brokerage Association submitted a document to the Social Bureau for mediation of the dispute, which is recorded as follows: Presentation for reporting matters. The association received a letter from your bureau on the 24th of the previous month, regarding the dispute over cartage for Tianjin gang employees, ordering representatives to come to the bureau for questioning, etc. Following this, on the 25th, we sent representatives Mao Yanling, a committee member, and Wu Yongxia, a public relations officer, to your bureau to await questioning. According to Committee Member Mao and others, they were instructed that the dispute should be mediated by the Association as soon as possible. On the 28th, we first summoned the Tianjin gang to the Association to inquire about the truth of the incident. According to the Tianjin gang associations, including Litaichang, Nangongyi, Yufengsheng, Taichangxiang, and Tongfagong, the cartage fees for customs brokerage employees were initially due to the long distance of shipment and inconvenient transportation. The customers sought quick transportation and had the practice of subsidizing cartage fees. Over time, it became a custom. However, this was obtained by the employees outside, and the customs brokerage never asked about it. In recent years, customers have directly handled goods from foreign firms, and this additional cartage fee is no longer recognized, resulting in threats of strikes by employees once before. As a result, the customers still paid as usual. After the January 28th Incident, Japanese customs brokerages took the opportunity to release the board, waived the cartage fee, and charged customers only 2.84 yuan per piece for shipping. As a result, many customers were greedy for convenience and entrusted the Japanese brokers to handle the shipment. Our association even had no goods to handle and watched the rights and interests flow out. In order to recover, we had to lower the price accordingly. This cartage fee came entirely from the customers, and the customs brokerage could not increase it for the customers, nor could it abolish it for the customers. Taking it would not harm the industry, and abolishing it would not benefit the industry. So why would the industry deprive the employees of their interests and cause meaningless disputes? As for the industry providing employees with monthly salaries and cartage fees for shipments, which are all paid by the industry, the industry has never reduced them because the customers give additional cartage fees. From a rational point of view, the industry has no responsibility for the existence or absence of this unexpected cartage fee. If they use this as a threat, the customers and goods will all fall into the hands of the Japanese, and the result will be the end of the world. Moreover, the current water foot for each piece of foreign cloth, cotton yarn, etc. is only 2.84 yuan collected from the customers. After paying the shipping company 2.52 yuan per piece, the truck fee 0.24 yuan per piece, and the dock workers 0.07 yuan per piece, the industry only has 0.01 yuan left. And the industry's employee salaries and all expenses are still unsettled. The market is so depressed, and the foreign invasion is so great. If our merchants still do not care about the pros and cons and fight each other, driving fish into the deep, it will be painful to say. We will report the whole story to the court. Based on this, Fucha Customs Brokerage and employees, in name, are in the position of capital, but what they rely on for life is all in the customers' goods. As for this additional cartage, according to the association, it comes entirely from the customers. The customs brokerage cannot take it for itself, and the employees do not take it from the customs brokerage. The two parties have no reason to infringe on each other. The reason for the incident is that Japanese customs brokerages release the board and lower prices, and customers flock to them. In order to recover the rights and interests, our customs brokerage has to reduce it accordingly. As a result, the customers also stopped paying the cartage fee, and the employees could not forcefully collect it from the customers. Once they suddenly lost this long-standing benefit, they could not help but vent their anger on the customs brokerage. I think that the most worrying thing at present is not that the dispute is difficult to solve, but that the customers and goods all fall into the hands of Japanese customs brokerages. Even if the industry tries its best to demand the recovery of this cartage fee, who is not greedy for cheap? If the customers and goods are stopped because of this, where can we take it from? The more the labor and management dispute, the more the Japanese industry develops, driving fish into the deep, and the result is the end of the world. This phenomenon should have been seen by your bureau long ago. The Association is in a neutral position and should fulfill its responsibility of mediation. In addition to continuing to summon both labor and management, we will sincerely advise them to eliminate the situation as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Consulate Flies Flags at Half-Mast in Mourning for Mrs. Cunningham</h3>
<p>The Remains Have Been Transported to Shanghai and the Funeral Is Scheduled for This Week</p>
<p>Mrs. Cunningham, the wife of U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Mr. Cunningham, passed away in Hangzhou the day before yesterday. Her remains were transported back to Shanghai by car that night. The Zhejiang Provincial Government sent four officials to accompany the transport. Mr. Cunningham also accompanied the transport. The funeral is scheduled to be held at the Hankou Road Cathedral at 11:30 AM on Saturday morning. The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai immediately flew the flag at half-mast upon receiving the news of Mrs. Cunningham's death. It is said that the flag will also be flown at half-mast on the day of the funeral. This is unprecedented and is intended as a special tribute. Mr. Cunningham has already published advertisements in Chinese and Western newspapers requesting friends not to send wreaths.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Approves This Year's Budget</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for regular and temporary revenue and expenditure for this year, and the financial report for the previous year (1933), were submitted to the Board of Directors meeting by the Finance Committee yesterday and were approved.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Director of Finance to the committee, the actual regular income last year, after making up for the deficit in 1932, was 17,256,357 taels, of which 1,623,490 taels were allocated for education. Regular expenditures, including education expenses, totaled 17,182,001 taels. At the end of the year, there was a surplus of 19,597 taels in ordinary expenses and a surplus of 54,759 taels in education expenses.</p>
<p>In terms of regular income last year, the actual income was approximately 728,000 taels short of the forecast. This was because the initial estimates were inevitably slightly too optimistic, and the number of vacant houses also exceeded expectations. However, at the same time, the various administrative departments were more cautious about the use of funds, and most of the expenses were within the prescribed amount. Therefore, although income decreased, it was still able to break even.</p>
<p>Regarding the interest account, the income exceeded by approximately 25,000 taels, but the proceeds from the sale of the Electricity Department have not been delivered, so this account is unlikely to have any surplus in the future. It is found that the Municipal Council's income in recent years has actually been short of the amount of approximately 2% of the municipal tax. In the past two years, it has been compensated by drawing from the general reserve fund. However, this is only because of the proceeds from the sale of the Electricity Department and cannot be regarded as a regular practice. It is estimated that in recent years, because of this fund, public bonds totaling 37,000,000 taels have been redeemed, and 10,600,000 taels have been allocated to the sinking fund for the 1924-27 public bonds. Moreover, since 1929, construction costs totaling approximately 29,600,000 taels have been paid without resorting to borrowing. Otherwise, the construction expenses and interest on public bonds, calculated at 5.5%, would require a municipal tax of 5% to cover. The Municipal Council's current debt is 19,500,000 taels, while the debt repayment fund has 12,000,000 taels. After offsetting, the actual debt is only 7,500,000 taels.</p>
<p>Regarding the 1934 budget, the estimated total regular income is 24,431,700 yuan, and the total expenditure (including education expenses) is 26,390,060 yuan. The shortfall has been decided to be covered by drawing 2,000,000 yuan from the general reserve fund, with an estimated remaining surplus of 41,640 yuan. Compared with last year, income has increased by 1,280,000 yuan (land tax can be increased by approximately 960,000 yuan, and municipal special tax, license tax, municipal general tax, and wharf tax can all be increased). Expenditure has increased by 1,406,000 yuan, which is largely the natural result of the increase in the business of various administrative departments. However, in the future, the interest account can only have losses and no profits, so the burden on the budget will increase with each year. Therefore, construction plans, except for those that are extremely important, must be tightly controlled.</p>
<p>Regarding the temporary budget for this year, the total amount (excluding temporary education expenses) is 24,710,830 yuan, of which 4,958,570 yuan is the amount of the previous year's deficit. Because there were funds advanced at that time, it was decided not to borrow money to reduce the burden, and this amount was included in this year's budget. As for this year, it is necessary to borrow money or raise 15,500,000 yuan by other means (this level was anticipated in 1930). The specific methods will be submitted to the Board of Directors for deliberation after the annual meeting of ratepayers. As for this year's temporary expenditures, thanks to the practical cooperation of the various directors and the detailed consideration of the various committees, they have been limited to the most urgent and indispensable limit.</p>
<h3>The Navigation Administration Bureau Reduces the Burden on Shipping Companies</h3>
<p>Since Director Peng took over the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, when technicians of the bureau went out to inspect ships in the past, in addition to shipping companies providing boats and vehicles for transportation, the technicians hired boats and vehicles on their behalf, and the fees paid on their behalf were reimbursed after the shipping companies paid them to the bureau. Approximately 9 yuan for large wheelers and 7 yuan for small wheelers. Director Peng believes that this method is prone to corruption and has decided to abolish it. He has issued a notice to all shipping companies and a letter to the Shipping Association stating that from the first of this month, before the bureau has boat and vehicle equipment, when shipping companies apply for inspection and measurement, they must provide their own boats and vehicles for transportation. Technicians will no longer pay on their behalf, nor will they charge fees from shipping companies, to reduce the burden on merchants. In addition, the bureau will provide the insurance steam valve keys for each ship in the future without additional charges, to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Telephones to Request the Cessation of the Collection of License Fees for Small Wheeled Boats in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications yesterday, saying: (omitted above) According to a letter from the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association, the association received a joint letter from members Yuantong and Tongyuan Shipping Bureaus, stating: We respectfully inform you that on December 7th of last year, we received a notice from the Executive Yuan ordering the Zhejiang Provincial Government to stop collecting wheel boat license fees, and we have already instructed our members to comply. However, the Zhejiang Second District Shipping Office and the Pingwang Nanxun Shipping Sub-Office are urgently urging the wheels of the Shenhang Shenhu Line of the Yuantong Bureau to pay fees and obtain licenses, and are also levying donations on the various routes along the way. The wheels of the Shengjia Jiahu Line of the Tongyuan Bureau are being urged by telephone to collect fees, as urgently as a fire. The Executive Yuan has already ordered Zhejiang Province to stop collecting wheel boat license fees, so why are they not complying? The office replied that the suspension of wheel boat license fees refers to ships that are numbered by the Marine Fisheries Administration Bureau. Whether this statement is true or whether the office is disobeying orders and misinterpreting them is unknown. We, as ignorant people, feel at a loss. Therefore, we telegram Your Association to examine the situation and forward it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, begging for a clear explanation as to whether the Zhejiang license fees for our wheel boat industry are not included in the suspension of collection. Please also consult the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Qian, the director of the Second District Shipping Office, that before the Executive Yuan issues an interpretation, they must not force donations or fees from the wheels of the Yuantong and Tongyuan Bureaus, for the sake of public well-being. According to this, after investigating, the Executive Yuan had already notified the Zhejiang Provincial Government in February of this year to stop collecting wheel boat license fees. Now, the Zhejiang Second District Shipping Office is still forcing the collection, which is not only a violation of the glorious order, but also a disturbance to merchants and harm to the people. Furthermore, the office replied that the suspension of wheel boat license fees refers to ships that are numbered by the Marine Fisheries Administration Bureau. This argument has no legal basis. At a time when the shipping industry is declining, it is absolutely inappropriate to engage in exploitation and increase the burden on the shipping industry. According to the situation in the letter, we specially telegram Your Association to beg you to forward it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, and quickly order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to instruct the Zhejiang Second District Shipping Office to stop collecting fees, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and maintain the shipping industry, which is for the benefit of the public. etc. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce salutes. After investigating, the original text of the Executive Yuan's No. 3066 instruction of last year states: After investigation, the Maritime Law stipulates that ships with a total tonnage of 26 tons and a capacity of more than 200 dan have been registered by the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications in accordance with the law, and tonnage inspection certificates and ship nationality certificates have been issued. Local government offices in various provinces should no longer order these ships to apply for licenses and collect fees, resulting in a situation of double taxation. The provincial government is ordered to comply. The wheel boats of the various member bureaus of the association, which sail on the inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, are all ships of more than 20 tons, and have all been registered with your ministry and the Ministry of Communications in accordance with the law, and have obtained inspection tonnage nationality certificates. The verification complies with the regulations of the Executive Yuan that provinces should not double-collect license fees. The said Executive Yuan order was issued to Zhejiang Province last year, and newspapers have already published it. The Zhejiang Second District Shipping Office has neither complied with the order to stop collecting fees, and has misinterpreted the Executive Yuan order. Its situation is particularly harmful to merchants and violates the law. It is reasonable to telegraph Your Yuan Ministry to examine and verify, and to order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to instruct them to stop collecting fees, in order to comply with the Yuan order, which is for the benefit of the public. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce salutes.</p>
<h3>News of Rent Reduction in Sanminli</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the rent reduction movement in Sanminfang, Puyudong Road, Nanshi, the tenants have elected representatives such as Zhang Gang to write to the landlords to persuade them to reduce the rent voluntarily. It is now heard that there is talk of reducing the rent by several percent, but the date of implementation must await the agreement of both parties.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Arrest of Union Cadres at the Wusong Machinery Factory</h3>
<p>Union Branches from Two Railway Lines Telegraph the Party Headquarters, Urgently Requesting Rescue Efforts</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Expresses Their Position, Responding to the Railway Bureau with a Demand for Cautious Handling</p>
<p>The Special Party Headquarters of the Two Railway Lines issued a statement saying that all workers at the Wusong Machinery Factory of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways had, in December of last year, reported Ying Heng, the chief of the General Affairs Department and concurrently chief of the Materials Department of the two railway lines, for defaming the Party Headquarters, undermining the labor movement, abusing his authority, and engaging in corruption. They telegraphed the Party Headquarters and the unions of the two lines, requesting them to send personnel to investigate, handle the matter impartially, and petition the Central Government and the Ministry of Railways to dismiss and punish Mo Heng. At that time, the Fujian Incident was occurring, and the Party Headquarters and unions of the two lines, in order to avoid escalating the situation, sent personnel to earnestly persuade and explain to the workers of the entire factory. At the same time, they petitioned the Central Government to order the Ministry of Railways to handle the matter impartially, and work was resumed, restoring the original situation. Later, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to investigate, and as a result, determined that Mo Heng, the chief of the General Affairs Department and concurrently chief of the Materials Department, had spoken incautiously, causing a misunderstanding and leading to the incident. The Ministry of Railways reprimanded Mo Heng, and he was given a warning. All problems were also resolved.</p>
<p>The Course of Events Leading to the Arrest of All Cadres</p>
<p>On the morning of March 30th of this year, at approximately 10:00 AM, Huang Boqiao, the director of the two railway lines, ostensibly convened a meeting with all the cadres of the branch office of the factory's union for discussions. Simultaneously, he secretly colluded with the police department of the two railway lines and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to entice and arrest ten cadres from the factory's union branch office: Cao Wenkui, Lin Jinlin, Li Kuikui, Tang Genfa, Xu Shanqing, Shi Genyuan, Han Weiyu, Zhou Weixian, Chen Shusheng, He Laixing, and others. They were put on a car and sent to the headquarters.</p>
<p>The Union Telegrams the Party Headquarters for Rescue</p>
<p>After the case occurred, the unions of the two railway lines immediately convened an urgent meeting. It was resolved to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the case and to appoint Director Min Luoheng to inquire with the Garrison Headquarters about the truth of the matter in order to reasonably respond to the Railway Bureau. They also telegraphed the Party Headquarters of the two railway lines, explaining the truth and seeking ways to rescue them. The original telegram is excerpted below (omitting the titles): Your esteemed consideration, upon investigating, on the day of the 30th of March, Huang Boqiao, the director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, convened all the cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory branch office of the two railway lines' union in the conference room of the Shanghai North Station Transportation Office under the pretext of holding discussions. Except for Tang Dafa and Zhu Derong, who were absent due to illness, the remaining eighteen people, Xu Shanqing, Lin Jinlin, Li Kuiyuan, Cao Wenkui, Tang Genfa, Chen Shusheng, Zhou Weixian, Shi Zhenyuan, He Laixing, Han Weiyu, and others, were suddenly arrested by railway police during the discussions and escorted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. All the employees of the railway were shocked upon hearing the news, but the reason for the arrest was unknown for a time. It was not until April 1st that the Shanghai newspapers contained detailed reports, stating that the cadres were arrested because the Wusong workers had filed a complaint against Mo Heng, the chief of the General Affairs Department and concurrently chief of the Materials Department of the Railway Bureau, which had resulted in a work stoppage in December of last year. Upon investigation, the work stoppage on that day was due to the workers' accusations against Mo Heng for insulting the Party and the country, undermining the labor movement, abusing his authority, and engaging in corruption. They listed the facts and earnestly requested the Railway Bureau to dismiss him from his post and investigate him, and sent representatives to the Railway Bureau to present their views. However, the Railway Bureau, considering the case to be related to the Railway Bureau's scandalous affairs, tried its best to whitewash it. The workers were even more indignant to see the Railway Bureau glossing over the situation in this way, and they all believed that in order to uphold Party affairs and the labor movement and to rectify official corruption, it was necessary to ask Chief Mo to personally come to the Songhu office to explain. They had already obtained Mo's agreement, who promised to go immediately, but day after day, he never set foot in the Song factory and did not notify the workers. Waiting for Mo's explanation led to the work stoppage. If it was a case of absenteeism, it should have been handled through legal procedures. Moreover, it was during the Fujian Incident, so how could they willingly step into the trap of the law? Therefore, Mo Heng was fully responsible for the work stoppage on that day. The union, considering the situation to be serious, sent personnel to guide the workers in various ways. Since the Railway Bureau refused to accept the case, the workers had no choice but to go to Beijing to petition the Central Government and the Ministry of Railways in order to clarify the Railway administration. Subsequently, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate, but the Railway Bureau again used deceptive tactics to deceive the special commissioner, covering up the facts and siding with Mo Heng. Fortunately, your esteemed association, under the leadership of the Central Government, guided the union and announced that they should work with peace of mind and file another petition for resolution. The workers, deeply understanding the righteousness during the Fujian Incident, gradually eased the situation. However, three months have passed since then, and the workers are still working as usual without any accidents. Since the Ministry had approved the investigation and handling, they should wait patiently for the resolution. Therefore, they abided by national laws and did not dare to make unreasonable demands. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Railways has delayed the decision for a long time, and the Railway Bureau has recently appointed Qiu Weiying, Li Xuanyu, Wang Shufang, and others to work at the Wusong Machinery Factory. The workers believe that the Railway Bureau has always used the slogan of saving Railway funds, but now it has suddenly added a large number of personnel to serve in the factory, increasing public funds by more than a thousand yuan per month, which is a waste of Railway funds. Why are all the workers' previous requests always rejected? This shows that the Railway Bureau's rectification of Railway administration and saving of Railway funds are just self-deceptive slogans. On March 21st, the Railway Bureau persuaded Chen Chengshi, the chief of the Car Affairs Section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the current executive member of the Party Headquarters of the two railway lines, to accompany Qiu and Wang to the factory to explain to the workers. However, a portion of the workers began to make noise before he finished speaking, and even threw debris, causing Chen to be injured and bleed on his forehead. On the 28th, the Railway Bureau issued an order to the union, stating that the workers' actions were lawless and undisciplined. If they were not corrected, what would become of the situation? It asked whether these rioters belonged to the Wusong Machinery Factory branch of the union, who was the instigator, and who was the accomplice. It ordered the union to investigate and report the details within three days of receiving the document for verification and handling. The union also believed that the actions of a few workers were rash and inappropriate. It was immediately decided to convene a meeting of the cadres of the branch office on the afternoon of March 30th to review the situation at the factory at the time of the incident. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the same day at 11:00 AM, the cadres were arrested at the North Station. At the same time, the Railway Bureau issued Order No. 129 of the General Department, stating that the workers of the Wusong Machinery Factory and the Materials Factory had previously accused Mo Heng, the chief of the General Affairs Department and concurrently chief of the Materials Department, and simultaneously implemented a work stoppage. Now, the Ministry of Railways has issued Order No. 8736, instructing the following: (1) The original accusations have been investigated and found to be without evidence and should be dismissed. (2) Chief Mo's incautious remarks caused a misunderstanding and should be given a warning. (3) The workers of the factory did not resolve the matter according to the law and instead engaged in a work stoppage to coerce, and Cao Wenkui has not yet complied with the transfer to Ningbo, which is inappropriate and should be handled according to the law. The Bureau will comply with these instructions. Upon investigation, the cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory branch of the union not only did not stop the previous work stoppage, but also violated the law by directly publishing articles to the outside world, and the directors and supervisors of the union did not correct them, which is inappropriate. At that time, the Central Government was suppressing the Fujian rebellion, and Shanghai was a key rear area. The Railway's military transport was also very tight. However, the two factories suddenly experienced a work stoppage, almost delaying the overall situation, which is extremely regrettable. The Railway has always been known as a model Railway, but now it has such a disreputable behavior, which is also very regrettable. The union's handling was inappropriate and should be reprimanded. The illegal actions of the Wusong Machinery Factory branch of the union should be discussed and dealt with by the union, and they should be warned not to have such out-of-bounds actions in the future, which is of utmost importance. It can be seen that the Railway Bureau should handle the case in accordance with the Ministry's orders, and the occurrence of this case was due to Mo Heng's defamation of the Party Headquarters, undermining of the labor movement, abuse of authority, and engagement in corruption. Mo Heng should bear full responsibility. Now, Mo Heng, with his guilty body, has escaped legal punishment, while the workers who filed the complaint according to the law have been arrested. There is nothing more bizarre than this. Moreover, the document mentions that the union should discuss and deal with the matter, but without waiting for the union's discussion and decision, it used emergency measures to entice and arrest all the cadres, which is even more absurd. The union sent personnel to Wusong to investigate the reason for the cadres' arrest. Unexpectedly, the Railway Bureau's notice had already been posted in the factory, stating that in December of last year, the workers of the Wusong Machinery Factory and the Wusong Materials Factory went on strike for a week under the pretext of various reasons, causing the Railway to lose huge sums of money. They also incited other workers to respond. At that time, the Central Government was suppressing the Fujian rebellion, and Shanghai was under martial law. The military transport of the two lines was very important. It was reported that reactionary elements were manipulating the situation, attempting to disrupt the overall situation. Now, the Ministry has ordered that this work stoppage should be handled according to the law. In addition to removing the employees who instigated the labor unrest in accordance with Article 30 of the Railway Employee Service Regulations, they should be transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation and punishment in accordance with the order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission. It also stated that the Railway Bureau had reported to the Ministry of Railways, which was then ordered by the Ministry of Railways via telegram, which had been forwarded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission for approval, outlining two points: (1) Cao Wenkui should be punished by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to the fullest extent of the law. (2) If the Wusong Machinery Factory attempts to strike again, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters will immediately send the Shanghai Municipal Security Team to severely suppress it. The Bureau has complied with the order and executed it on March 30th. From the above observations, it is clear that the Railway Bureau has a deep-seated hatred and resentment towards the Wusong workers for reporting the Mo Heng case and is eager to seize an opportunity to vent its personal anger. Considering the Railway Bureau's extreme hatred and resentment towards Cao Wenkui and the other cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory branch, the focus is on the Railway Bureau's mistaken belief that Cao Wenkui and others were the instigators of the report against Mo Heng. Therefore, it did not hesitate to fabricate charges against Cao and others and imprison them, which is truly painful to say. Because the cadres had difficulty restraining the workers during the work stoppage, they used the pretext of affecting the military transport of the Fujian rebellion, deliberately exaggerating the situation in order to shift the blame to the workers, fabricating facts. The Railway Bureau's deception of superiors and subordinates, sudden use of emergency measures, and illegal enticement and arrest of all cadres, where are Party discipline and national law? Upon investigation, the Ministry of Railways has determined that Mo Heng's incautious remarks caused a misunderstanding and has clearly ordered him to be warned. It is clear that Mo Heng should bear full responsibility for the cause of the work stoppage. Now, the Railway Bureau has completely shifted the blame to all the cadres and arrested them all, reversing right and wrong and greatly affecting the Party's and the people's future in the labor movement. We earnestly request your esteemed association to forward this to the Central Government and to telegraph Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to quickly order the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to investigate the truth, allow the release of all the innocent arrested cadres, so as to benefit the labor movement and reassure the public. The telegram ends with extreme anxiety and urgent waiting for orders, the Railway Union directly under the Ministry of Railways, Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, respectfully.</p>
<p>The Two Railway Lines Party Headquarters Expresses its Position</p>
<p>The Special Party Headquarters of the two railway lines believes that the Bureau's measures in this case were somewhat hasty. Because the labor unrest incident that occurred last year at the factory due to Mo Heng had already been resolved by the Party Headquarters, and work was resumed and the original situation was restored. It has been almost three months since then. The Railway Bureau did not take preventive measures before the case, and after the case, it delayed the matter and did not seek a quick and proper resolution. Recently, after receiving the order, it suddenly used decisive measures and secretly enticed and arrested the cadres, which is very regrettable. Now, the Party Headquarters, after the 62nd meeting of the Executive Committee, has resolved (1) to assign Standing Committee Member Chen Chengshi to properly handle the entire case, (2) to report to the Central Government and appoint Secretary Xie Chengyu to personally report everything to the Central Government, and (3) to express its position and respond to the Railway Bureau, urging it to handle the matter cautiously. It is hoped that this case can be properly resolved as soon as possible. The original text of the Party Headquarters' official letter in response to the Railway Bureau is excerpted below. To the direct reply, we have received your Bureau's letter No. 719, indicating the handling of the Wusong Machinery Factory workers' rejection of the newly appointed staff and the situation of Chen Chengshi being injured, etc. upon receipt of this letter. This Association believes that the matter is inconsistent with the facts and therefore solemnly declares the following. The case involving the Wusong Machinery Factory and the Materials Factory workers' complaint against Mo Heng last year is a misunderstanding. Upon investigation, although Comrade Chen Chengshi is a standing member of this Association, he accompanied Qiu and Wang to the Song Factory on March 21 to explain, without any mission from this Association, but in a personal capacity to assist the Railway Bureau and the head of the Wang Machinery Department, etc., with a friendship between classmates,勉任 mediation. Comrade Chen Chengshi himself has detailed reports in the Executive Committee and party-government talks of this Association, and your Bureau Director also made the same statement. This time, Comrade Chen Chengshi 暨 Qiu 王 was injured and insulted, purely for damaging the administrative dignity of the Road Bureau, and has nothing to do with the Party Department. In the last meeting, your Bureau Director put forward the severe sanctions, and Police Superintendent Ma advocated disciplinary rectification. The members of this meeting at that time expressed their approval under the principle of 整顿 Wusong Machinery Factory and maintaining national discipline. In addition, he made a statement that the work must be fair, find out the facts and must not implicate the innocent. Therefore, the decision of the meeting was to deal with it according to law, and after only a short time, the Wusong Machinery Factory cadre Xu Shanqing and others 10 people were suddenly induced to be arrested. After that, a letter was also known that it was discussed with this association and the issue was affected to a great extent, which is a pity. The case of the Wusong Machinery Factory and the Material Factory workers' complaint against Mo Heng occurred between December of last year and it has been three months now, and any emergency handling will never be delayed like this. That is, the second item of the Ministry of Railways' order said that Chief Mo's statement was not cautious, causing a misunderstanding, and should be warned, and that the case had already been returned to the fact as to how it was caused. At that time, this association considered the motives of the workers, for maintaining the Party and the labor movement, deemed that it was pure, but at this time, the actions of the Fujian rebellion should be more cautious, so it spared no difficulty in earnestly counseling, while submitting the details of the case to the Central Government, waiting for processing. Unexpectedly, this time a small number of workers at the Wusong Machinery Factory, under the pretext of saving public funds, hinted that they rejected the staff and the bad elements, and the case of injuring Comrade Chen Chengshi was suddenly added to the great subject of the previous year's检举莫案, combined and dealt with, and used a news-style smoke screen to confuse the listening, which is a pity. In short, this association believes that your Bureau will replace the Chang Wusong Machinery Factory and punish the bad elements of the 殴辱Chen Chengshi and the 裘王 two members, believing that it is purely an administrative scope, and your Bureau will not hold any dissent if it is handled fairly. The 10 cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory Branch Office were arrested, and there are Party members Xu Shanqing, Chen Shusheng, and He Laixing, probationary Party members Li Kuiyuan, Shi Zhengyuan, Cao Wenkui, and three people each, and even the Party Department Trade union was not known in advance, and was arrested. The nucleus and the Central Order and Law is obviously a conflict, like this destruction of Party affairs, the destruction of labor movement, which is not in accordance with,准函 front, corresponding letter, that is, hope to check,慎重处理, so as not to cause trouble and so on.</p>
<p>Various Unions Telegram for Quick Rescue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine Factory and the Shanghai-Hangzhou section of the Road, each sub-office, since the case occurred, have sent telegrams to the Party Department, and quickly依法 rescue, and the telegrams from the sub-office of each trade union are excerpted as follows (abbreviated): I read the news in the East Daily that all the cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory Trade Union sub-office were arrested. I felt very shocked. The safety of all the employees of the Road is a matter, and it is necessary to determine right and wrong.务乞钧部 according to reason, and will be given bail soon, so as not to hurt the innocent. The Shanghai Machine Factory Trade Union sub-office 冬, and also reported that ten cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory sub-office were arrested, I was very disturbed after listening to them. Is the real picture if any, first set up a rescue, 免累 innocent, it is public convenience, 沪杭 section of the Trade Union sub-office, ,</p>

<h3>The Second Branch Issued a Caution to Judge Wen for the Ji Case</h3>
<p>屏迹绝交 Strictly Prevent Gua Li</p>
<p>More Personal Inquiry 少接宾朋</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court yesterday issued an order to the judges of the hospital and the Shanghai First Special District Court, saying that the Shanghai First Special District Court accepted the case of Ji Juemi being sued for seduction. Some people presented to the Department of Judicial Administration that the judges Feng Shide and Xiao Xie 棻 had a friendship with Ji Jue弥, and they cited the Xiao Xie 棻撰赠 memorial association recorded in the 荣荣rong哀录 to prove it. After being ordered to strictly investigate, this hospital dispatched members to investigate in detail, and the hospital director personally went to various places to secretly visit, and transferred the Harvard 荣哀录 for reference. According to the mourning speeches published in the record, many people from political and business circles in Shanghai at that time were listed among them. 核 its nature, the whole is a kind of virtual text on the custom. 匪特 cannot be presumed that the judge has a friendship with Ji Jue弥, that is, with the Harvard What kind of friendship is, but can not be judged accordingly, has been truthfully reported in the case, but after查司法 officials,滥行应酬, once offered the Department of Judicial Administration twenty-one years of training words number 281 training to strictly prohibit it,况上海 place development, the society is complicated, 民商 and personnel, is the matter of life relations can not be avoided, 一有纠纷, it is inevitable that the public court will be right, at 自好者,固专依法律以求伸, and at 狡黠者 则每思诡获以取胜, 临讞遇此, 贵能公明, 然以第五伦之贤, still said that can not be without selfishness, 矧在常人, 倘与当事人素有往来, and did not reach the degree of avoidance, vertical not to deliberately move, and the chest can not be empty of things, case handling that is difficult to hope to hold on, to criminal cases, touching life reputation, more than civil affairs, and more important, and recently bad habits, every 有棍徒, 利用法庭 as a tool, often by 嗳昧 The matter is unclear,以為居间诈取之资, the other party is not the local big merchant, that is, the wealthy households, 司讞者 as always Fengcai Junzheng, still can not avoid 横遭 slander, Yin was coerced, If you have a knowledge of a certain construction, you will be used by it in a heavy time, and it will also lead to gossip in a light time, and the harm of abuse is not known to the extreme.This time, the Ji case can be used as a Yin Jian, and the special Shenxiao rebuke, all my colleagues, not only交游 should be cautious, that is, the usual response, also should stand self-cliff shore, 其有易</p>
<h3>Hu Xiyuan's Opinion on the Interpretation of Trademarks by the Judicial Court</h3>
<p>After Hu Xiyuan of the Electric Appliance Industry expressed his opinion on the second paragraph of Article 1 of the Trademark Law, which was interpreted by the Judicial Court, it aroused great attention from the industrial sector. The various industrial groups expressed their opinions one after another in order to remedy the situation. The industrial colleagues took Hu's written opinion as more detailed, so they asked the China Federation of Industrial Associations and Hu himself to review the original text, and in order to gather wisdom and benefit everyone's research, the original book is published as follows, for reference (略略略) Regarding the explanation of the second paragraph of Article 1 of the Trademark Law, only the shape of the word is discussed, and the sound is not asked. The industrial sector is not only anxious because of the personal interests of the industrial sector, but also has some inconsistencies in the legal and sentimental affairs. Now, let me say it separately, (1) The sixth item of Article 2 of the Trademark Law [the same or similar to the trademark used by others in the world for the same commodity] shall not be presented for registration as a trademark, and the [similar] two words have a wide range and have no express provisions for formal similarity, then it clearly includes the similarity of sound, which is among them, and the dispute of trademarks will necessarily arise from the commodity known in the world. If the name of the commodity has not been announced, except for special circumstances, there will be no trademark dispute, and even the strong people will use the same trademark, I am afraid that they will also frown and will not follow, and the article gives strong protection to the famous goods, and now if only the shape of the word is discussed, regardless of the sound, the original intention of the article will be completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhanggen Opened the Coffin for Examination</h3>
<p>Sudden Death Suspicious拘陆林清</p>
<p>法醫检騐 Today</p>
<p>Zhang Zhanggen, a copper smith in Zhangjiazhai, Nanxingwan, Gaohang, Pudong, was unemployed and distressed due to the closure of the Wusong Railway Factory. He was invited to Wusong by Lu Linqing and died suddenly. As a result, the corpse's wife Zhang Ling was given 70 yuan and代为收殓, the corpse was taken back to息事 after more than a month. However, because Zhang Ling wanted to sell her husband's land, she was stopped by her uncle, so she took the tablet to the police station to accuse her. After interrogation, the death of her husband was suspicious, and her sister Huang Zhang came to the office and claimed that her brother died suddenly, and the ears were green and swollen. Therefore, the station will be陆拘获解送 the court for interrogation and detention, (the details have been recorded in the previous report) The Procuratorate thought that the case of human life was serious, whether there was injury or not, it was not enough to judge without examination, so the family was declared, and the coffin was quickly sent to the hospital, and the coffin was opened for 相騐. Yesterday afternoon, the corpse Zhang Ling's, the corpse sister Huang Zhang's, the corpse coffin of Zhang Zhanggen was transported to the court. After reporting, he ordered the bailiff to take the family home and送至眞茹法醫研究所检騐 by the hospital car, and it was scheduled to open the coffin for inspection today (即6th) and so on.</p>

<h3>Health Bureau Announces Shooting of Horses with Glanders</h3>
<p>A Total of Twenty-Eight</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that yesterday, the Health Bureau announced that glanders in horses is extremely harmful, not only spreading among the herd but also posing a threat to humans. Not only is their flesh poisonous and highly dangerous, but their urine, saliva, and milk can also transmit the disease. Therefore, farmers who raise horses, grooms who tend horses, and soldiers in the army are often tragically killed by this disease. This is a matter of great concern for public health. Thus, Director Li ordered the slaughter of the horses. The horses had to be sent to the Health Laboratory for blood tests. The first test results revealed that twenty-eight horses were infected with glanders. Director Li, considering the importance of public health and national defense, did not hesitate to sacrifice the harmful horses. He requested the City Government to approve the destruction of all the infected horses by shooting and burning. To alleviate the hardship of the owners, the City Government will provide appropriate subsidies. Mayor Wu approved the request, and Section Chief Wang of the Second Division consulted with the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) to assist in the execution of the twenty-eight diseased horses. The SMC Public Health Department, recognizing the importance of public health, assisted in shooting and burning the diseased horses one by one the day before yesterday, eliminating them completely. This constitutes a new record in public health administration. In the future, the Health Laboratory will continue to actively inspect horses, and a request has been submitted to the National Health Administration to inform domestic industrial operators that many imitate but lack creativity. If one industry shows even a slight profit, everyone flocks to it, resulting in mutual destruction. The few who possess extraordinary ability and are not crushed and overturned simultaneously rely on the protection of trademark law. If we only consider the form and disregard the sound, the protection afforded by trademarks loses most of its effectiveness. Moreover, if a new product in an industry seeks a trademark that sounds the same as an established brand, their intentions are obvious. The reason they did not attempt this before was because they knew that the application of Article 1, Section 2 of the Trademark Law would not be favorable under previous interpretations. Now that the new interpretation facilitates considering form without regard to sound, the trend of allusive imitation will grow daily. This is the fifth point. (6) Considering the current environment, the market is flooded with inferior goods. Unscrupulous merchants, driven by greed, are racking their brains to counterfeit domestic goods. They are somewhat deterred by the protection of trademark law, so they must hide their intentions and dare not do so openly. If the interpretation of the Trademark Law disregards sound, they will blatantly engage in counterfeiting. If so, there will be no hope for domestic goods. This is the sixth point. In conclusion, if the interpretation of Article 1, Section 2 of the Trademark Law is not corrected, not only will trademark disputes never cease, but the future of the industrial sector will also become increasingly troubled and gradually approach extinction. I have not studied law, but what I have said above is not an exaggeration. Feeling a sense of danger, I dare not remain silent. Therefore, I have further elaborated on what was not fully covered in my previous letter, focusing on what will inevitably occur in reality. (End of excerpt)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Market Dominated by Superior Chinese Cement</h3>
<p>Daily News Claims Chinese Goods Exclusively Occupy the Market</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Trapped in a Desperate Situation</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun yesterday, since last year, the situation of cement in this port has been such that Chinese goods were originally priced at five dollars and seventy or eighty cents per barrel, while Japanese goods were cheaper, selling for only four dollars and forty or fifty cents. However, the Chinese side, using anti-Japanese sentiment, worked hard to maintain the market price and compete with Japanese goods. Although Japan's Onoda and Asano jointly stood on the front lines of competition, the Chinese side suddenly lowered prices, reducing the price per barrel to five dollars and twenty cents, with a difference of only thirty or forty cents compared to Japanese goods. In addition, the National Government recently added import duties, approximately one dollar and sixty cents per dan (a unit of weight). As a result, Japanese goods had to increase their market price. Because Japanese goods became more expensive, Chinese merchants hardly considered them at all. Currently, Japanese goods are in a desperate situation. On the other hand, Chinese goods have exclusively occupied the local market. Even imports from Soviet Russia have suffered a similar blow due to increased taxes, and are experiencing the same difficulties as Japanese goods.</p>
<h3>Telephone Company Disconnecting Lines Without Reason Should Compensate for Losses</h3>
<p>Chinese Ratepayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Yesterday</p>
<p>Strictly Managing the Powers of Franchise Businesses</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a complaint from the Zhonghua Box Factory stating that at 7:30 AM on the 29th of this month, the taxpayer's telephone line, number 53373, was disconnected by the Shanghai Telephone Company without reason, making it unusable. The factory immediately borrowed telephone number 53349 to inquire with the Business Department of the Shanghai Telephone Company, and was told that the 53373 telephone line had indeed been cut off. The taxpayer's telephone bill for this quarter was paid in full on March 17th, as evidenced by the receipt. However, the Telephone Company, without careful investigation, abruptly stopped the telephone service, deliberately neglecting its duties, for which it should be held responsible. We then borrowed telephone 53349 and directed our Huaji Road office to use telephone 52922 to inquire with the Business Department of the Telephone Company, but the staff replied that the telephone bill had not been paid or that the matter was not their concern. We also inquired with extension 01 and the accounting department, but received the same responses. Until there was a concrete response, for such a large franchised business organization, the internal disorder is inexplicable, disregarding the rights of its users and acting arbitrarily. We then negotiated several more times, and finally received an inquiry from 11044, which referred us to 15960. Upon calling 15960, we only heard a vague statement that they were aware of the matter, without explaining the reason for the disconnection. After several more reminders, the line was finally reconnected at 1:30 PM. The total time of unjustified disconnection was six hours, from 7:30 AM to 1:30 PM. The losses suffered by our factory in terms of business and reputation were significant and substantial. During this disconnection, our factory's customers assumed that our factory's financial situation was dire, unable to even pay the telephone bill, resulting in the Telephone Company abruptly taking action, stopping the telephone service, causing a major misunderstanding and leading to much discussion and speculation, all of which was caused by the Telephone Company. Therefore, the company cannot evade responsibility for this unjustified disconnection. Our factory, being a taxpayer, has reported the facts to your Association, and requests that you forward this letter to the Municipal Council, which is responsible for managing and supervising franchised businesses, and instruct the Telephone Company to compensate our factory for the losses suffered in terms of business and reputation, as a warning for the future. We hope that your Council will promptly exercise its authority to supervise and manage franchised businesses and order them to compensate the victims for their losses, demonstrating the intention to safeguard public utilities." Addressed to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Xin Jiangtian Encountered Fog and Almost Ran Aground</h3>
<p>Dangerous Situation, Narrow Escape</p>
<p>Crew and Passengers Rejoice in Their Survival</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiangtian departed from Shanghai. The ship was carrying as many as 1,700 to 1,800 passengers. To prevent pirates, the exterior iron gates were locked after the ship set sail. That night, the fog was thick and difficult to navigate. Because it was a scheduled run, the ship could not delay its departure, so it continued to sail. At 2:43 AM, the ship passed the Daxiaoji Islands. The sea was not visible, so it anchored to wait for the fog to clear before continuing, showing caution. In that sea area, there is a lighthouse called Valaon, which is located in an area full of hidden reefs, making it the most difficult area to navigate. A lighthouse was built there to guide the ships. Opposite the lighthouse is an area of clustered reefs. After the Xin Jiangtian anchored, it could not find the lighthouse. It was suspected that it had not yet arrived, and was still searching. At this time, Chief Navigator He Hongyao was on duty and ordered to steer to the right, intending to follow the Ningxing route. In fact, the Xin Jiangtian was anchored next to the lighthouse. The lighthouse light was obscured by the fog. Chief Navigator He Hongyao ordered to steer to the right, believing that the Ningxing route was viable for this ship as well. After only one minute of sailing, the captain urgently ordered to stop and wait to identify the direction before proceeding. At 2:48 AM, the fog cleared slightly. The crew on deck discovered a large black mountain ahead of the ship and rushed to report to the captain to quickly reverse the engines, as they were already in the reef zone. Fortunately, the captain had ordered to stop, because in just two more minutes, the entire ship would have run aground and been smashed to pieces. The danger was extremely close. They quickly reversed the engines and returned to the original anchorage near the lighthouse to wait for the fog to clear before proceeding. At that time, all the crew members were frightened and lost color, all claiming it was a great stroke of luck. If the captain had not stopped the ship, the Xin Jiangtian would have caused an unprecedented tragedy. Moreover, the passenger cabins were mostly locked, and if an accident had occurred, none of the passengers would have survived. It was truly a stroke of luck. After the ship returned to Shanghai, the crew members said that this time they had survived a disaster, and their lives were like being reborn. If the captain had not ordered to stop, the consequences would have been unspeakable. When the crew members arrived in Shanghai and spoke to others, they all expressed their good fortune.</p>
<p>The Changde Bao immediately went to investigate and report to the Sixth District for investigation.</p>
<p>The Horrific Scene of the Murder: After receiving the report, District Chief Tan sent Inspector Cheng, along with Police Chief Hu, to investigate. They found that the unidentified male corpse was approximately 30 years old, wearing a black cotton-padded jacket, blue cloth trousers, gray cotton socks, and blue imitation serge shoes. He was bald and had no hat, appearing to be a worker. Beside him was a blank diary, a cigarette case containing a pawn ticket. The lower half of his body was inserted into the mud at the bottom of the canal, while the upper half floated on the surface. The temples, forehead, tip of the nose, side of the mouth, and left cheek had sustained five or six knife wounds. There was a severe wound on the back of the head and another on the front of the neck, where the throat bone had been severed, with blood and flesh blurred, a truly tragic sight. It appeared that he had been murdered elsewhere and his body dumped here.</p>
<p>Request for Autopsy: District Chief Tan, considering that the case involved assassination, immediately ordered the detective team and the police officers under his command to strictly arrest the murderer for punishment. At the same time, he ordered Wang Songsheng, the local head of the 12th tu (a unit of households), to report to the local court for an autopsy. At 2:00 PM, Prosecutor Wu from the court arrived at the scene and determined that the unidentified male corpse had indeed been murdered. He ordered the local head to prepare a coffin for burial and ordered an investigation into the identity of the deceased's family and the arrest of the murderer for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Ships Carrying Dangerous Goods for Import Must Notify the Harbor Master in Advance</h3>
<p>Gu Lien, Harbor Master of the Jianghai Customs, issued Bulletin No. 11 yesterday, stating: "Hereafter, for any ships carrying dangerous goods, whether for import to Shanghai, transshipment, or passing through Shanghai, the Harbor Master's Office must be notified at least forty-eight hours before the ship arrives in Shanghai. If there is any doubt as to whether the goods are dangerous, the matter should also be reported to this office for determination. All ship managers and owners are hereby informed.

<h3>Municipal Council Reviews Applications for Hotel and Restaurant Licenses</h3>
<p>The Public Safety Committee of the Municipal Council held a special meeting on March 22 to review applications for hotel and restaurant licenses. Major Darby of the Salvation Army, and Messrs. Milligan, Fitch, Todd, Thomas, and one representative of a Japanese women's group attended the meeting. Major Darby stated that a large portion of the foreign community, especially the poor, suffered greatly from alcohol. Chinese wine and vodka were often sold in the alleys, and the poor, attracted by the low prices, would indulge in drinking, causing damage to their spirits and bodies, making it difficult to find work, and sometimes getting drunk and having their clothes stolen. Therefore, the issuance of liquor licenses should be strictly controlled, and the practice of issuing temporary licenses should be abolished. Mr. Fitch also said that there were already too many taverns, and the hours for selling alcohol should be further restricted. After discussion, the following decisions were made: (A) Applications for hotel licenses: 1. 287 Yunnan Road, 2. 164 Jing'an Temple Road, 3. 218 and 238 Yuyuan Road, 4. 873 North Sichuan Road, 5. 422 Tiantong Road. Except for the fourth one, which is not allowed to set up a public bar, all are approved. (B) Applications for hotel licenses: 6. 3A Xinkang Road, 7. 440 Sichuan Road, 8. 500 Tibet Road, 9. 216 Jing'an Temple Road, 10. 1269 Jing'an Temple Road, 11. 6 Dahua Road, 12. 139 Broadway Road, 13. 863 North Sichuan Road, 14. 93 Seward Road. All are approved, but the sixth one must be handled according to the instructions of the Works Department. Regarding applications for hotel licenses in movie theaters, as there were no violations, it was deemed unnecessary to change or add restrictions. Regarding the general restriction of alcohol sales hours, it was deemed to be closely related to the current policy, and no suggestions were made. (C)</p>
<p>Applications for restaurants (serving alcohol with meals) licenses: 15. 565 Nanjing Road, 16. 795 Jing'an Temple Road, 17. 870 Jing'an Temple Road, 18. 918 North Sichuan Road, 19. 368 Tiantong Road, 20. 10 Wiesen Lane, 21. 12 and 24 Lane 429 Wusong Road, 22. 662 Broadway Road, 23. 1-3 Yuanchang Road, 24. 6-8 Yuanchang Road. Except for numbers 22 and 23, which were rejected based on the opinions of the Police Department, the rest were approved. (D) Applications for beer and other ale licenses: 25. 104 Central Building, 26. Opposite 729 Fuxu Road, 27. 226-230 Jing'an Temple Road, 28. 1178 Jing'an Temple Road, 29. 1179 Jing'an Temple Road, 30. 224-226 Baker Road, 31. 27 Lane 1000 Gordon Road, 32. 4 Lane 455 Haifang Road, 33. 6 Peng Road, 34. 7 Lane 15A Peng Road, 35. 47 Peng Road, 36. 8 Lane 72 Peng Road, 37. 105 Peng Road, 38. 2258-9 Peng Road, 39. 101 Zhapu Road, 40. 336-338 Zhapu Road, 41. 358 Zhapu Road, 42. 306-308 Haining Road, 43. 125 Nanxun Road, 44. 404 North Suzhou Road. The twenty-sixth one will be approved after complying with the methods specified by the Health Department. The thirty-seventh one was rejected because the applicant had moved out of the address. The forty-third one was rejected based on the reasons given by the Police Department. The rest were approved. Furthermore, applications for renewal from those who have already obtained licenses for categories A, B, C, and D were also approved. The Committee's proposal was submitted to the Board of Directors and has been approved for implementation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk Industry Bank Held Its Third Annual General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ratified the Capital Increase Plan and Revised Articles of Association</p>
<p>Elected Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, located at 460 Hankou Road, has been established for three years. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the bank held its third annual general meeting at the Banking Association at 4 Hong Kong Road. In addition to all the directors, supervisors, and deputy managers, more than 300 shareholders attended, including Qian Xinzhi, Wang Shoushan, Tao Changhai, Xu Xinliu, Kui Yanfang, and Wu Yunchu. The meeting was declared open at 1:00 PM. After the usual formalities, Chairman Wang Yansong gave a report on the business situation, stating that the bank's development in terms of organization and business over the past year could be summarized in four points: (1) Increasing Capital: The bank's original capital was 600,000 yuan. Last year, as business gradually developed and credit grew, it was decided at the previous shareholders' meeting to increase the capital by 400,000 yuan. Later, due to enthusiastic investment from all parties, the amount exceeded the original amount. At the twenty-third board meeting, it was decided to revise the amount to 600,000 yuan, and the full amount has now been raised.

<h3>Smashing a Secret Destruction Bureau</h3>
<p>Detaining a Substitute and Summoning Witnesses for Verification</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the abolition of taels and the conversion to the yuan, the private destruction of national currency for recasting into silver ingots has been strictly prohibited, and orders have been issued to all provinces, cities, and counties for compliance. Last night at 8:30 PM, the First Precinct of the Second District of the city, acting on a tip, reported that Wu Yu Ji Sand Shop at No. 45 Fuyou Road was privately destroying national currency and melting it into silver ingots. Chief Shen immediately dispatched Inspector Hong Wensun, leading Police Chief Mu Zhenjiang and other officers, to the scene. They apprehended Wu Ruisheng, a Jiangxi native, his wife Wan Wu, and two furnace workers. They also seized six silver ingots (each weighing approximately 50 taels), one ingot mold, 13 various account books, three checkbooks, and two check stubs. All were taken to the precinct for investigation.</p>
<p>During interrogation by Chief Shen, Wu Ruisheng confessed, "We are the old hands at the sand shop. Wu Yu Ji has gone to another port to solicit business. These ingots are not from the private destruction of national currency for profit. They were entrusted by Juxing Silver Shop on Avenue Edward VII to be melted for the making of silver ornaments." The Chief questioned the origin of the ingot mold, to which he replied, "Old Wu used to run a silver furnace but was ordered to close it." Considering the case involved the private destruction of national currency and recasting into silver ingots, it was deemed necessary to detain them pending investigation and to summon witnesses for further verification.</p>

<h3>Cold Weather During Qingming Festival Leads to Many Illnesses</h3>
<p>Crops Grow Very Slowly</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been erratic, alternating between cold and hot, leading to a rise in cases of smallpox and scarlet fever among residents of this city. Yesterday, the 5th (Qingming Day), the weather suddenly changed from early morning, starting with drizzling rain followed by dark clouds and a piercing chill, making it unusually cold. With Qingming already past, such cold weather has caused crops in the rural fields to grow very slowly. As the Shanghai saying goes, "During Qingming in the second month, wheat grows evenly; during Qingming in the third month, wheat does not grow." This year, Qingming fell in the second month, but the wheat has still not grown evenly.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Rent in Xi Hua Li, Gongping Fang</h3>
<p>Xi Hua Li, Gongping Fang, located in a remote part of the Eastern District, are both properties of Fuyuan Real Estate Company. Monthly rent for single-unit houses is as high as 60 taels, and for two-story houses, it reaches 37 yuan. Since the January 28th Incident, the market has been sluggish, and tenants are unable to bear the burden. Slightly overdue rent situations have occurred, and lawsuits have been filed once, but ended in reconciliation. According to the reconciliation agreement, tenants who were one or two months behind in rent were suddenly sued again by the landlord, who also requested the court to execute a preliminary attachment. Tenants did not receive prior warning, leading to the forced closure of several businesses, including Fufeng Rice Shop. The city-wide rent reduction movement is progressing to revive the market, but the tenants in that neighborhood are instead being subjected to pressure. They have strengthened their unity to seek a reasonable solution.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in the Society section of your newspaper on March 28th, titled "Poochow Military Academy Fifth Term Graduate Yao Xijun Impersonates Teacher and Abuses Authority to Issue Orders," after investigation, there is no such person as Yao Xijun among the graduates of the Fifth Term of our school, nor is there anyone with the same name as the perpetrator in any term. It is evident that the perpetrator is using the name of a graduate of our school to impersonate a military officer and commit crimes. In addition to sending a separate letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters requesting severe punishment for the perpetrator, we hereby specially request your newspaper to promptly make a correction to avoid misleading the public and affecting the reputation of our school.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Having just read the news item published in your newspaper on the 5th of this month regarding the arrest of two more sanitation workers in western Shanghai yesterday, there are many discrepancies with the facts. Upon investigation, at around 3:00 AM yesterday morning (the 4th), officers from the Caojiadu Wujiaochang station brought in two sanitation workers, Jin Linsheng and He Yongfa, for allegedly spilling manure on the road, obstructing public sanitation. After interrogation by our district office, it was clarified that the manure workers claimed the manure cart had a crack, causing the manure to leak out, and they did not intentionally spill manure on the road. They were reprimanded and released, the manure cart was returned, and they were instructed to immediately repair the crack in the manure cart to prevent manure leakage and obstruction of hygiene. However, there was no arrest or detention of the manure workers.</p>
<p>We hereby inform you accordingly, hoping for a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Sixth District Office, Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau</p>

<h3>Imperial Incense: Hazy Records</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Behind this palanquin, there were also six large sedan chairs, all painted red, each carried by eight eunuchs. These were for the attendant female officials, of which my sister Rongling and I were two.</p>
<p>The orderly procession advanced in an atmosphere of extreme solemnity. People and horses rarely made any noise. Occasionally, there was a cracking sound, which was the sound of the heavy sedan chair poles turning on the shoulders of the carriers. Apart from that, only the world-renowned chief eunuch Li Lianying would move around, shouting orders in a low but extremely fierce voice to the people in the procession. Because these ceremonial guards and processions were all arranged by him alone, everyone had to obey the orders of this terrifying demon.</p>
<p>From the gate of the Summer Palace to the gate of the Rehe Imperial Palace, on this official road, hundreds of miles long, the ground was covered with golden, damp yellow sand. Ordinary people were not only forbidden to walk on this imperial road, but were also to be executed if they were caught standing in the distance, gazing at the imperial carriage passing by. Therefore, no one had ever dared to violate this rule.</p>
<p>The procession moved on and on. This yellow snake-like imperial road gradually wound its way into the verdant valleys. We secretly wondered what kind of thoughts the Empress Dowager was having at this moment? She had been away from Rehe for almost fifty years. That place could be considered her birthplace. At that time, she was a very beautiful and young woman. Her position in the palace was only that of a favored concubine of Emperor Xianfeng. Because Xianfeng died suddenly, it immediately stirred up the conspiracy of two powerful ministers in the court, who wanted to depose her young son - Tongzhi - and usurp his throne.</p>
<p>Although she was not very familiar with the situation in the court at that time, and she did not have any special experience, the environment forced her to use a very clever strategy to deal with those two conspirators - Yixuan and Sushun. Later, with a heart full of worry, she snatched her son from the tiger's mouth, and on this yellow snake-like imperial road, fled from Rehe back to Beijing. (4)</p>
<h3>How to Converse?</h3>
<p>— Shen Minxing</p>
<p>A person who is good at conversation, who uses beautiful words and humorous tones to arouse the hearing of others, and to make others admire him, will surely gain many advantages in his life.</p>
<p>Therefore, a person who is good at conversation can not only make strangers like him when they meet him, but also make and get to know many friends. Taking "a person must have friends," "friends are our good teachers," and "relying on friends when away from home" as proof, then a person who is good at conversation can gain even greater advantages.</p>
<p>The refinement or crudeness, the excellence or inferiority of conversation, is most sufficient to show your level of education and your status. Your words will often unintentionally reveal the events of your life. Your conversation will announce all your secrets and reveal your true face to the world.</p>
<p>We often see people who have ideas in their hearts, but their words are not sufficient to express them; who want to speak, but stutter and cannot speak. These people can be considered the most pitiful people in the world!</p>
<p>Some people have brilliant thoughts and unique opinions, but they cannot express them. Their language is not sufficient to make their thoughts look like something. Their words are like a revolving lantern, always the same set of words. I ask, what effect do such people have on society?</p>
<p>On the contrary, does society need such people?</p>
<p>The American educator Eliot once said: "In the education that creates an 'upper-class person,' there is one training that cannot be missing: elegant and refined conversation."</p>
<p>Therefore, the art of conversation is a practical need, a need that cannot be missing!</p>
<h3>Under the Rain</h3>
<p>— Shang Wen</p>
<p>The rain began to fall softly at dawn, but it was very light; and the air became unusually dull. It seemed misty, everything was blurred, and everything was stained with a layer of water vapor, damp.</p>
<p>By noon, the rain had become very heavy! The sky seemed much lower than usual, and the air became even more oppressive. Terrible weather, not a breath of wind, stifling!</p>
<p>Under the rain: I thought of my umbrella, I thought of my sister with the umbrella, my sister who had been with me under the umbrella for three years!</p>
<p>Nine years ago, my sister loved me then, and she had not passed away. Under the rain, we held up an umbrella. The umbrella belonged to both of us, and we bought it together in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The rain was still falling, and our umbrella, which was once a vibrant green, had faded to a pale white, already nine years old. My sister, too, has been dead for three years!</p>
<p>The rain is falling even harder today, hitting my body and imprinting itself on my heart. The umbrella is lost, under the rain, I walk with hurried, disordered steps, and two lines of tears flow straight down from my eyes, beaten down by the raindrops!</p>
<h3>The Great Republic of China</h3>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 27: The Grievances of Fujian Province Subside in Secret, Kind Hearts are Moved; Idle Sorrows Arise after Drunkenness, Old Affairs are Hard to Forget</p>
<p>Yang Guizhi was imagining ways to pass the time in bed that night, and naturally she couldn't help but think about the future. But as soon as she thought about the future, she remembered the many precedents on this Haidian Street. Some were middle-aged women left behind by their husbands who had died in battle, raising young children. Others were old mothers left behind when their sons went out and never returned, waiting at home every day. If she were to say that she might not end up like that, it was possible. Then there was Huang Manying, who would never be like that, because she was basically a woman without a master, and her relationship with Company Commander Tian was just that of friends. There was no need to ask about Tian Qing's future, because even as things stood now, it would not be illegal for her to marry someone. So she was very free, caring little about her family or friends, and openly dating a boyfriend. When I saw her boyfriend at the time, I was very embarrassed for her. But she didn't care at all, and even introduced him to me, saying that he was her cousin. These days, it turns out that love between men and women is like this: they are together, intimate, wishing they could become one person. But when they turn around, they each go and find their own lover. And me? I originally had a lover, Gan Erye. But I am very loyal to my husband, and after I got engaged to him, I didn't share any of my thoughts with Gan, and he probably knew that I wasn't of two minds, so he absolutely didn't come to tease me. If he did come to tease me, could I be like Huang Manying, treating him like a cousin and inviting him home to chat? Guizhi kept turning the event she had seen at Huang's house during the day over and over in her mind, thinking about it, and in the end, the key point was still that other people were not married, while she was married. How could she have the same freedom as others? (355)</p>

<h3>Research on Inkstones (17)</h3>
<p>— A Bored Guest</p>
<p>General Overview of She Inkstones</p>
<p>(4) The information provided in the previous section on inkstone pits is just a general overview. Now, I will record the famous pits separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Longwei Mountain is located in the southeast of Wuyuan County, about fifteen miles away. It is connected to Wu Creek in the west. The mountains are picturesque and the water is clear. All the other mountains are branches of Longwei Mountain, extending for over a hundred miles. This pit was opened during the Southern Tang Dynasty and abandoned during the Northern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>(2) Luowen Mountain, also known as Furong Creek, has more than ten interconnected pits along the creek. There are no stones in the creek. Some enthusiasts have passed down the story that they are called stones in the water. It is said that the old pit of Luowen is located in Zaitou, which is where Qian Xianzhe of the Northern Song Dynasty's Jingyou era visited the old stone quarry of the Southern Tang Dynasty. The color of the upper pit is slightly heavier, the color of the middle pit is slightly lighter, and the lower pit is the mudstone.</p>
<p>(3) Meizi Pit is located to the west of Luowen Mountain. From the creek to the pit is more than ten feet. The pit has no soil, and it is more than ten feet deep and two or three feet wide. It was discovered during the Kaiyuan era.</p>
<p>(4) Jinxing Pit is located to the northwest of Luowen Mountain. There are very few high-quality stones, and most are rough and sparse.</p>
<p>(5) Bili Pit is located in Jiyuan. The color of the stone is green and translucent. Within half a mile, there are Shuibu stones and Dadudian stones. Ten miles away, there are Qingshan stones, which are fine and green with golden patterns and halo-like markings, varying in shape.</p>
<p>(6) Shuixuan Pit is located outside the Mei Pit. It can be accessed when it is dry in winter. The stones are found at a depth of more than ten feet and often have golden flower eyebrow markings.</p>
<p>(7) Shui Jue Pit is located to the northwest of Luowen Mountain. It was discovered during the Jingyou era. The stones have wave-like patterns, but they are no longer available today.</p>
<p>(8) Xitou Pit is located to the north of Jinxing Pit. The Jinxing stones are flawed and slow to ink.</p>
<p>(9) Ye Jiu Pit is located to the west of Xitou Pit. It has eyebrow stones, which are slightly rough and slow to ink.</p>
<p>(10) Lu Pit is located to the northwest of the county. During the Jingyou era, the magistrate Cao Ping extracted stones from it. The guard Wang Junyu also extracted stones from it. During the Jiayou era, the lieutenant Diao Qiu extracted stones from it. The stones have a blue-green halo, but they are no longer produced.</p>
<p>(11) Jiyuan Pit, Bili Shuibu, these three pits are adjacent to each other. (The Shuibu stones with raindrop-like white halos are the "Shuasi Luowen" mentioned in Lu Shen's Chunfengtang Collection of Books).</p>
<p>(12) Lingyan Mountain has three interconnected caves. The raw stones have few flaws, dry slowly, and the lustrous ones resemble Duanxi stones.</p>
<p>(13) Hidden within the Ma stones are inkstone materials that are several inches long, like jade in the rough, found in the streams and can be collected when they are dry in winter.</p>
<p>According to Gao Sisun's Inkstone Notes, the above-mentioned pits are credible. However, according to other books, there are also Jinzu, Zhuangji, and Yu pits listed alongside the Luowen Pit. Their stones are inferior to those of the old pit. Mudstone, Zao Xin, and Green Stone are three pits located next to the old pit. The mudstone is warm, smooth, and dense, but not very firm. The fine Zao Xin stones are warm and lovely, with small patches of roughness and slight dryness. Green Stone is slightly tender in texture, and those with Luowen markings are the best. The Shuibo Pit is close to the lower pit of Luowen and produces Guazi Luowen, which is rare. However, due to the long passage of time, the pit veins are no longer known. The Miaoqian Pit is located in front of the ancient temple on Luowen Mountain, and it is as moist as purple jade with gold star speckles. One or two were discovered during the Jingyou era of the Song Dynasty, but their location has since been lost.</p>
<p>The conditions of the pits are generally as described above, but the famous materials are often found in deep streams. One must wait until the water is dry in winter and gather dozens of workers to excavate. If it rains even once, the previous work is all abandoned. The difficulty of mining is no less than that of the Lower Rock of Duanxi. Moreover, after the Song Dynasty, all the old pits were abandoned, and famous materials are no longer produced. Unlike Duan inkstones, which continue to be discovered, She inkstones that are truly good ones from the old pits are even more valuable today.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Firmly Oppose the Puppet State's Attempt to Participate in the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Convenes Responsible Organizations from Various Schools and Groups</p>
<p>Gathering the Strength of All to Make a Final Effort with Effective Methods</p>
<p>A Telegram Sent to the Shanghai Press Association Yesterday</p>
<p>Since Japan proposed that the puppet state of Manchuria participate in the upcoming Far Eastern Games, the voices of opposition from overseas Chinese in Manila have been very strong. Although our government has repeatedly expressed its attitude, firmly rejecting the puppet state's participation, the voices of opposition continue unabated. Our newspaper received another telegram yesterday from overseas Chinese in Manila to the Shanghai Press Association, stating that the Chinese Chamber of Commerce had convened various overseas Chinese newspapers, schools, and public organizations throughout the Philippines to form a support association to make a vigorous opposition and resolutely reject the participation of the puppet state of Manchuria. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>"[To] the Shanghai Shenbao and the Journalists' Association: Yesterday, the Manila Overseas Chinese Commercial Daily, New China Daily, News Daily, Pioneer Daily, and Minzhong Journal jointly requested the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to convene various groups, schools, and newspapers to organize an agency to deal with the puppet state's participation in the Games, suggesting three points: (1) The Chamber of Commerce should convene various chambers of commerce, the All-Philippines Salvation Federation, the National Crisis Support Association, various groups, schools, and newspapers to organize a responsible agency to address this issue. (2) In the name of the responsible agency, send telegrams to China and abroad to awaken the public to unanimously oppose the puppet state's participation in the Far Eastern Games, and issue documents to promote it abroad, so that people of all countries can know the true public opinion of our country. (3) If our country's sports association authorities, under the military pressure of the political environment, generously allow the puppet state to participate at the round table conference, then this responsible agency should gather the strength of all to make a final effort with effective methods, such as sending telegrams to various provinces in our country to dissuade athletes from participating. If there are those who are willing to be slaves of a subjugated nation and dare to attend, they should be condemned by all, and urge overseas Chinese to unanimously boycott the Games and not enter the venue. Today, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce has decided to fully accept it, and scheduled a general meeting on the ninth to discuss the implementation plan. Please publicize it widely. Sincerely, Pioneer Daily, Kouchi]"</p>

<h3>Li Gongying Creates New Amateur Shooting Record</h3>
<p>One Shot Scores 185 Points</p>
<p>Won a Total of 457 Points Yesterday</p>
<p>Will Win the Championship Steadily in Today's Continued Competition</p>
<p>Our country's shooting king, Li Gongying, met Combes yesterday in the Group A final of the Shanghai Amateur Association. Who will be the Shanghai shooting king will also be decided in the north. The first two rounds totaled 1,000 points, and Li has already won 457 points. Today, at 5:30 pm and 9:00 pm, each will compete for another 500 points, and Li can steadily win the championship. In the first round yesterday, Li took the lead with 500 points compared to 269. In the second shot of the second round, Li suddenly scored 185 points in various shooting methods, breaking the past amateur competition records held by Madina's 169 points and Bernal's 171 points. The huge score of the two rounds is as follows:</p>
<h3>Li Gongying (1,000 points)</h3>
<p>First Round 24, 21, 78, 29, 48, 65, 26, 36, 23, 31, for a total of 34 shots, averaging 14.7.</p>
<p>Second Round 21, 185, 25, 23, 49, 33, 28, 23, for a total of 40 shots, averaging 12.5.</p>
<h3>Combes (543 points)</h3>

<p>Second Round 42, 71, 26, 62, averaging 8.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Seven-Mile Cross-Country Championship</h3>
<p>A Total of Thirteen Teams Participating</p>
<p>To be Held on Sunday Morning</p>
<p>The Jiangwan Seven-Mile Cross-Country Championship, organized by the Westerners' Sports Association, is scheduled to be held at Hongkou Park at 10:30 am on the day after tomorrow (the 8th). There are a total of thirteen teams participating in this competition, with Chinese accounting for six teams, including the Jingwu Sports Association, the China Sports Association (two teams), the Huaguang Track and Field Team, and the Feima Hongkou Two Cross-Country Team. The Westerners include the Argentine Army, the British Army, the British Navy, the Russian Overseas Chinese Sports Association, and two teams from the association. The strongest in this competition should be the French Army, the British Army, and the Russian Overseas Chinese Team. There will be a fierce battle for the championship. The Chinese are not without capable players, but they are scattered among the teams. Although Jingwu has famous Shanghai players such as Chen Xuzhou, Wang Zhenglin, and Zhou Ruquan, the hope for the championship is very slim. Jin Zhongkang, who won the first place in the 10,000-meter demonstration at the National Games, has also joined the competition. However, he rarely practices at the venue. This kind of muddy road track requires sufficient experience to cope with, so it is still a question whether Jin can win the championship. In short, the Chinese have completely given up hope in this competition. The names of each team are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Westerners' Sports Association (Team A) 1. Niu Qibao, 2. Howard, 3. Mike Han, 4. Xipeng, 5. Pu Gees, 6. Niu Pan.</p>
<p>(2) British Navy Cruiser Brunswick 7. Max Dong, 8. Pan Sainash, 9. Deng Ge Lingxin, 10. Kos, 11. Bai Lieke, 12. Unknown.</p>

<h3>Fendou Shield Table Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Registration Closes Tonight</p>

<h3>Madwoman</h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>It was the second day I went to W City. I found a peculiar woman at the entrance of the hotel. She looked about twenty years old, wearing a purple cotton gown with white floral patterns, her hair was very long and neatly combed, her round face was quite beautiful, but her eyes were a little too sunken, and when she looked at people, she looked as fierce as a tiger about to eat someone; her mouth was always smiling, walking in and out of the hotel entrance, muttering something.</p>
<p>When men passed by, she glared and scolded. When she saw women, she laughed out loud. Immediately, I realized that this was not a character from Simalu, but a mental patient.</p>
<p>During dinner, Mr. Yin told me that the madwoman was the daughter of the hotel manager, a [maiden] who had not yet been betrothed.</p>
<p>After twelve o'clock at night, I suddenly heard the sound of chairs being thrown, doors slamming, followed by shrew-like scolding, the voice fierce and shrill, sometimes almost like a ghost crying. After scolding for a while, she laughed out loud again; before the laughter stopped, she started crying loudly again; after crying, she threw things again, broke glass, opened doors, closed doors, spat in the courtyard: : : It was a complete mess. I wanted to secretly open the door and go out to see what she was doing, but I felt too scared. What if she chased after me? Even if she didn't chase after me, what if she hurt me with something? Wouldn't I be foolishly suffering a loss? There was no way, so I had to grit my teeth and stare at the sky until dawn.</p>
<p>[Were you scared last night?]</p>
<p>Mr. Yin asked me this way when I rinsed my mouth in the courtyard in the morning.</p>
<p>[Amitabha, thank you for telling me, so I was able to get up this morning.]</p>
<p>My words made Te and Lin upstairs laugh out loud.</p>
<p>When we were eating porridge, the madwoman was chewing on a fried dough stick in her mouth. She looked at us and laughed for a while, then scolded for a while. I deliberately clenched my fists and pretended to hit her, but she smiled sweetly at me instead; at this time, we were completely controlled by her and laughed along with her.</p>
<p>It is said that she has been mad for four years. Many people say that this is [Peach Blossom Disease] and that she will only get better after marriage. But heavens, who would dare to marry such a terrifying madwoman as a wife? [Why didn't you marry her off earlier?] I asked them.</p>
<p>[Her father wants to choose a rich man before he will marry her off.] Lin said.</p>
<p>[But rich people want to marry beautiful and flirtatious women, who would want to marry a madwoman?]</p>
<p>[Yes, her father ruined her life!]</p>
<p>The three of them suggested that I say good things to the madwoman's father to get her released. I replied with a smile:</p>
<p>[Whoever is willing to marry her, she will be released.]</p>
<p>There was another burst of laughter.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Yin, telling me that the crazy girl who had frightened me so much that I couldn't sleep all night had committed suicide! After receiving this news, both Te and I felt sad!</p>
<h3>Sailing</h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>There is no sun, the northwest wind is blowing coldly, the dark gray sky is putting on an ugly face, and the sea waves are pushing in rows, so our ship starts to shake.</p>
<p>I stood alone on the poop deck looking into the distance, but I saw that the masts were constantly tilting to the left and right, as if they had no stability at all. Whenever a wave hit, a group of passengers would be affected, and the number of people who lost their chopsticks, bowls, and wet bedding gradually increased. They squeezed into the middle, but the middle was not a safe area either. Later, they simply stopped escaping, waiting for the arrival of the waves, and everyone blindly expected the environment to improve itself. But the wind and waves seemed to be joking with these passengers, neither big waves swept them away, nor did it immediately calm down to make them feel at ease. They always teased them like this, with one wave not yet calmed down and another rising again.</p>
<p>In the distance, not even a single sail could be seen on the horizon. Only our lonely boat was struggling to move forward in this desolate sea.</p>
<p>[The symbol of life!] I thought. We take advantage of this lonely boat of life, traveling on this dim sea of life. The fate of the future is unknown, and most of the past is unbearable to recall.</p>
<p>Now, this unfortunate lonely boat is carrying a mission, carrying many lives, to cross the wind and waves and sail to a safe and beautiful place. This work is indeed difficult, but its hull is still strong and its horsepower is sufficient. Even if there are dangerous blows, it cannot be destroyed immediately! Although this journey is indeed a bit too heavy, having a burden can also reduce the emptiness and confusion in its heart. Its only intention now is to break through this gray environment and reach its destination.</p>
<h3>Musings</h3>
<p>— Xia Chang</p>
<p>(Fifteen)</p>
<p>Yan Shousheng (Pingzi) commented on essays, saying: [These short biographies, short narratives, and short notes are quite pleasing. If they were assigned to write imperial biographies or biographies of famous officials, they would put down their pens. If you talk to them about nature and heaven, they can talk endlessly. If you discuss world affairs with them, they can point out the details and continue endlessly? It's like a small craftsman who builds a small room, a stone bridge, a bamboo path, and arranges it as he pleases. Once entrusted with the Weiyang Palace and the Dew-Collecting Plate, he should stand aside. How different are those frivolous predecessors, who were once powerful, from frogs in a well?] This, of course, represents the views of the orthodox school on essays. It can be said that this view is not based on the quantity of words or the size of the style, but rather on the opposition of the thoughts of the orthodox writers of the Ming Dynasty and the essay writers. In terms of words and styles, there is really no difference.</p>
<p>(Sixteen)</p>
<p>Examining old manuscripts, I found several more short notes, all about life in the rain, which have a similar flavor to the life of the owner of the Bitter Rain Studio today. One is from Mo Tinggan (Qiushui) to Huang Wangzhou, which says: [Embracing depression in the rain, and the noise of human environment, it is extremely difficult for melancholy scholars to express their feelings. When it is slightly sunny, I will go out west and not stop.] The second is from Tinggan to Xu Wenqing: [Although spring rain is beautiful, I regret that it has cut off the communication with my acquaintances. I wonder what you are doing in the studio? If it does not clear up sooner or later, we should meet in person. What books are on the table? I would like to hear about them.] In the latter, the elegant demeanor of a pastoral poet is especially easy to see. However, no one describes life in the rain in more detail than Xu Shipu (Juyuan) to Fan Dashu. It says: [Living in the village and encountering rain, coming and going is cut off from people. Apart from serving food from morning to dusk, even wives and children are rarely seen. Living and planting bamboo, there are occasional bird songs. The low parapet and railing suggest that it is close to the mountains. During the day, I proofread historical books, and at night, I stretch out on a couch. I reject delicacies and stay away from bitter wine. There are no thoughts in my heart, or I may consider the gains and losses of the past and present, and only stamp my foot. After several days like this, the sky will clear up, people will arrive, and I will also go out. It is impossible not to record this. Therefore, I write this by the light of the lamp.] The life of old scholars can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>New Discussion on [Vernacular] [Classical]</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The discussion on the complexity and simplicity, skill and clumsiness of writing began with the rise of the plain text movement in the Tang and Song dynasties. The "Miscellaneous Notes of the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties" records: [When Ouyang Gong was in the Hanlin Academy, he went on a trip with his colleagues. A runaway horse killed a dog on the road. Gong said, "Try to write about this." A colleague said, "A dog was lying in the thoroughfare, and a runaway horse trampled it to death." Gong said, "If you were to write history, ten thousand volumes would not be enough." He said, "What do you think, Intendant?" Gong said, "A runaway horse killed a dog on the road."]</p>
<p>This famous story of the yellow dog and the runaway horse is seen in Shen Kuo's "Dream Pool Essays" and Chen Shan's "New Words While Picking Lice," and the meaning is roughly the same. At that time, the fashion was for scholars to value brevity. The people of the Ming Dynasty advocated restoring the past, and most of them also advocated brevity. It was not until the early Qing Dynasty that scholars began to make ambiguous judgments. Gu Tinglin said: [Words should aim for clarity, regardless of whether they are complex or simple. When the discussion of complexity and simplicity arises, writing dies.] It can be said that it is an extremely insightful view.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Lin Yutang advocated the form of recorded sayings, criticizing [modern people writing in vernacular Chinese are just like ancient people writing in parallel prose. They are unwilling to say a truthful word honestly. When they are worried, they say "the trembling of heartstrings," when they are happy, they say "the happiness of happiness," when they are persuaded, they say "accepting opinions," and when they are quick, they say "adding speed." : : : It's just a lot of rambling, and the writing is uneconomical.] (Analects, Issue 26) Rambling is [complex], and economical writing is [simple]. According to Mr. Lin's intention, the shortcoming of vernacular Chinese is complexity, and the strength of the form of recorded sayings is [simplicity]. In this way, we have returned to the old circle of debate over the complexity and simplicity of writing. Around the time of the May Fourth Movement, the promotion of vernacular Chinese generally said that vernacular Chinese was taking spoken language as writing, so that language and writing were close to each other. For more than ten years, the colloquial style has been popular, but the result is not the same. The vernacular Chinese written by women is sometimes hundreds of thousands of miles away from the language of rickshaw pullers and peddlers. For example, the subtitle of [Maternal Light] quoted by Mr. Lin [Her lament, her tears of blood, the audience's sympathy and sorrow, the tension of heartstrings - just at this time of lament, tears of blood, the audience's sympathy and sorrow, the tension of heartstrings, the embroidered curtain slowly fell] - to rickshaw pullers and peddlers, it is no easier than [Zixu Rhapsody and Shanglin Rhapsody]. Another example is a famous line from a certain poet [Ode to Pomegranate Flowers]: [The more the pomegranate flowers bloom, the redder they are, the redder they cannot be.] And the [Chinese Christians in Gulangyu, Xiamen bow three times to the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, considering it inconsistent with the Tongmenghui], all make people feel that the vernacular is too rambling. Why is vernacular Chinese often so rambling? Where is the difference between vernacular and classical Chinese? Is there a need to advocate the form of recorded sayings? We should re-examine these questions. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Spring on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>The train arrived in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>My heart was tightly entangled in a beautiful dream: Where is West Lake? I was so eager to see this scenic spot in Jiangnan!</p>
<p>I got on a rickshaw and went to the lakeside. - A line of seventeen people, seventeen rickshaws connected and ran through the streets of Hangzhou. I thought: The spring in Hangzhou is sunny, the wind is gentle: my nineteen-year-old heart should be happy here too, right?</p>
<p>Happy spring!</p>
<p>I couldn't help but shout when I saw West Lake for the first time.</p>
<p>- Don't you want to eat?</p>
<p>- Let's go boating on the lake! Let's go boating on the lake!</p>
<p>Overcoming hunger, five of us walked together to the lake. - The lake surface was still, and slight ripples tightly trailed behind the painted boats; the willows on the embankment swayed in the wind, and a gust of floral fragrance from I don't know where made me a little drunk standing on the lakeside.</p>
<p>We called a boat and all five of us got on. The warm sun shone on our heads, the leisurely lake water rippled under our feet, and there were the green hills on the opposite side, and the tower on the mountain stood there smiling like a giant. The boat left the shore and rowed towards the center of the lake, lightly and driftingly, and we were all silent for a while.</p>
<p>We rowed to Huxin Pavilion, and then to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon.</p>
<p>- Let's go up and take a look!</p>
<p>We all followed Miss X's advice and jumped ashore together. Surrounded on all sides by lake water: many birds were chirping on the branches. There were many words and paintings there, and Hangzhou's special products of lotus root flour and lotus root starch were sold. Miss X bought some and hung them on her hands, then returned to the boat.</p>
<p>We were all laughing on the lake: our hearts were happy and relaxed: : :</p>
<p>But, I don't know when, the dark clouds in the sky gradually thickened, and the sunlight had disappeared. When the boat rowed to Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake, thin lines of rain began to fall on our bodies.</p>
<p>- It's raining! What to do?</p>
<p>- Let's hide for a while, go up there: : :</p>
<p>- Let's row! Let everyone get wet!</p>
<p>Yes, the rain couldn't stop our interest in the lake, and the boatman had no choice but to continue rowing towards the lake.</p>
<p>The rainy West Lake has a different flavor! Misty, covered with a layer of fog, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and Huxin Pavilion half-hid their faces. After a while, the rain still hadn't stopped, and the calligraphy and paintings in Miss X's hand were all wet!</p>
<p>- Are you cold?</p>
<p>She asked me.</p>
<p>- A little: : :</p>
<p>Until dusk, the five of us returned to the hostel with wet and tired bodies. Looking at each other, we couldn't help but laugh.</p>

<h3>Half a Day's Lessons (4)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Hearing her words, I thought of Mr. Zhang, who was taken away by Japanese soldiers during the incident. It has been two years since we parted with Mr. Zhang. I don't know where she went. Such a good teacher who taught us cannot be found now. Comparing what she said before with the principal's words, there is a world of difference. What is called [new education]? Is it calling the Japanese "grandpa"? Is it honestly preparing to be a subjugated slave? This evil wild chicken, she is really a complete Japanese lackey! In a few years, it is said that a large number of submissive people will be created in the same school. At that time, the students will definitely forget that they were originally a part of the oppressed Chinese nation.</p>
<p>After that, I didn't hear anything she said, but I guessed from her first paragraph of training that the script must have been written for her by someone else. Otherwise, even two sentences, she wouldn't be able to say them so logically and use the words so appropriately.</p>
<p>After a while, she finished speaking, and the schoolboy brought several bundles of small paper national flags. The small flagpoles were only a little over a foot long, and the flag paper rustled in the wind. Each student was given a flag. The director of discipline came to speak again. After he finished speaking, we were led by him and set off in formation.</p>
<p>However, I remembered that interesting sentence of his and thought about it while walking. He said to the students like that:</p>
<p>[Don't think that going to the meeting is for fun. Actually, it's just like going to class!]</p>
<p>That's right, I can't remember how many times I've taken such lessons in the past two years. Often, when a Japanese official comes, we students will be ordered to go to the station to welcome him. This is a new lesson in the new education.</p>
<p>Following the Mongolian Banner Hutong, our team walked towards Weixin Street. The small flags in everyone's hands were all fluttering in the wind. On the contrary, everyone's psychology was lifeless. Therefore, the director of discipline shouted loudly:</p>
<p>[Why are you all so dejected? What are you thinking?]</p>
<p>When the team reached Xinkaimen Street, a team of students blocked the way. These were students from the Women's Normal School. Like us, they all had a small national flag in their hands. The people watching the excitement on the side of the street stood like two walls. At this time, I felt a little hot, unlike the weather on the car, which was still a bit cold.</p>
<p>The sky was humming, and three Japanese planes were flying from north to south. Afterwards, things fell from the sky like snow, flipping and flying, and it took a long time to fall to the ground. These were leaflets, both in Chinese and Japanese. Some children squeezed and snatched in the crowd, as if they had found some treasure.</p>
<p>The poor children only knew how to grab the leaflets, but they didn't know what was printed on them. They didn't even know that they were slaves of a fallen country. Naturally, they didn't have to worry about these things. Their parents were all coolies, who only knew how to run around for a living every day, only knew how to fill their stomachs, and had no time to think about the survival of the country! They didn't care about these things. Whether there was a country or not, they still lived a life of poverty. Their children, of course, also didn't pay attention to the rise and fall of the country.</p>

<h3>US Tacit Approval of Silver Bill May Make It Difficult for the Gold Market to Sustain</h3>
<p>Despite Central Bank Buying Over a Thousand Bullion Bars</p>
<p>Frequent Selling by Major Players Leads to a Fall of Three Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market ultimately struggled to sustain itself due to frequent reports of adverse news from overseas. The afternoon market was relatively calm. Initially, the overseas silver market saw a united pullback in both British and American markets. The five metals exchange saw forward silver prices rise by nearly four hao to one li three, and fall by as much as one li one. Exchange rates have already shown a pullback. London spot gold fell eleven pence, US cotton rose six points, and US wheat rose one point. Wool futures opened and immediately rose to 57 yuan. Subsequently, due to Associated Press reports mentioning the proposal to raise silver prices, gains were limited. After opening, the HSBC exchange rate suddenly contracted, leading to a period of strength. Although the Central Bank then vigorously entered the market with over a thousand bullion bars, an Associated Press report stated that the US government, in light of congressional opposition to the Canadian hydroelectric power project, might use the silver bill as a bargaining chip. If the bill were to pass, the government would likely take action to raise silver prices. Major players such as Cheng Feng Yong continuously sold off their holdings, causing gold prices to decline repeatedly. Later in the day, the market stabilized as banks showed a strong appetite for purchases. However, market conditions were generally mediocre, with the price of pure gold quoted at 971 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning at 956.7 yuan, 1.2 yuan higher than the previous close. Commodities opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of one shilling four and one-quarter pence for British exchange and 34.6875 yuan for US exchange. The opening was unremarkable. Subsequently, the market rose due to purchases by Mitsui of August US dollars at 25, Da De Cheng Hui Xiang, and others. It was learned that the HSBC exchange rate had contracted by 125 for British exchange and 375 for US exchange, causing the price to rise further to 7.9 yuan. Wan Xing Hong Li sold off, and Citibank settled May US dollars at 8125, retreating to within 7 yuan. However, the market remained stable due to the Central Bank's spot purchases, with Ying Feng Heng Gan Chang Xiang Heng Tai entering the market to buy bars. Later, an Associated Press report stating that the US government would use the Canadian hydroelectric power project as a bargaining chip for the silver bill led to a weakening of market sentiment despite the Central Bank's vigorous spot purchases. The domestic market gradually loosened, with major players such as Yuan Mao Yong Yuan Chun Zhi Feng Yong Yi Feng Yong Yuan Heng Yi Da Yong Sheng Da Xiang Feng Heng Xing Gan Chang Xiang Fu Yu Tian Feng Jia Tai Yu Qing Yong repeatedly supplying the market. Gold prices gradually fell to 1.3 yuan. Mitsui and Wah Bi bought August US dollars at half a yuan, taking advantage of the low price to buy bars and stabilize the market. The noon close was at 952.1 yuan, and commodities traded at 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 952 yuan, and commodities opened at 2.1 yuan. Banks released May US dollars at 1875, and Sheng Da Heng Yu Zheng Chang sold down to 1.2 yuan. Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wah Bi all bought August US dollars at half a yuan, stabilizing the market. Subsequently, Macquarie bought June US dollars at 25 and August at half a yuan. Heng Xing Yi Da Yong Heng Yu and others entered the market up to over 2 yuan, and market sentiment was quite good. The market then rose again to 2.7 yuan. Fu Xing Yong sold bars, causing a slight setback. Zhi Feng Yong repeatedly sold aggressively, causing the market to retreat again to 1.6 yuan. Heng Xing Fu Chang bought bars, and the situation remained stable. Later, with the Dalian gang and Yuan Yi vigorously buying, July US dollars at 375 were difficult to close out, and the market rose again to 2.7 yuan. The closing price was 952.5 yuan, and commodities traded at 2.2 yuan. After the market closed, Zhi Feng Yong Tian Feng Yi Da Yong sold off, showing signs of fatigue. The highest price during the day was 957.9 yuan, and the lowest price was 951.2 yuan, a difference of 6.7 yuan. The result was a decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the HSBC exchange rate for US dollars, was 375 lower, at 34.375 yuan, resulting in a standard gold price of 1,006 yuan and change. Based on the closing price, the premium was approximately 54 yuan, a decrease of 14 yuan compared to the previous close. The registered price for this month was 953 yuan, and for May was 952 yuan. The morning supplement was 953 yuan, and the afternoon supplement was 954 yuan. The price of pure gold was quoted at 971 yuan. The boiled pure gold market was calm, with formal transactions in the market adding 13.5 yuan. Approximately 2,000 taels were bought by the Tianjin gang, seemingly for settlement purposes. The public orders cleared yesterday totaled 119 bars for Gan Chang Xiang and 21 bars for Ding Chang, with Tong Ying Feng Heng collecting 140 bars. The Central Bank released approximately 1,400 bullion bars yesterday, with the price gradually decreasing from 958.5 yuan to within 955 yuan. Tai Kang Run Da Feng Heng Da De Cheng each opened 105 bars, with the remainder handled by Ying Feng Heng. As of today, 308 bars remain for April.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was chaotic. In summary, Ying Feng Heng Da Fa Yong Yuan Yi Heng Yu Si Da Gan Chang Xiang Da Cheng Yuan Mao Yong Yi Feng Yong Da De Cheng Hui Yuan and others were on the buying side. Zhi Feng Yong Fu Yu Yu Qing Yong Rui Xing Yi Da Yong Heng Chang Yong Sheng Da Yuan Mao Da Xing Yong Chun Yuan Heng Xing Yuan Hong Li and others were on the selling side. Hui Xiang Fu Xing Yong Tong Chun initially bought and then sold. Heng Xing Heng Tai Yuan Chun initially sold and then bought. The Dalian gang and Wan Xing jointly traded over 2,000 lots, settling with a slight gain. Shun Li jointly traded over 1,400 bars, settling with a slight purchase. The Guangdong gang Sheng Da jointly released approximately 900 bars, buying approximately 500 bars. Heng Xing bought over 200 bars and released over 300 bars. As of today, the total number of May futures contracts was 21,413 bars, with a total of 43 long positions and 55 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 37,121 bars in the morning and 14,112 bars in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Native Bank Business Declines</h3>
<p>Both Collection and Settlement Transactions are Stagnant</p>
<p>In recent days, following the foreign banks' closure, business was only slightly busier on the reopening day. Subsequently, due to weak market sentiment and a lack of substantial prosperity, lending became difficult, and funds were not easily deployed. Ultimately, the market became sparsely populated, and morale waned. Foreign interbank lending rates remained unchanged, at five percent for both the morning and afternoon markets. Overdraft facilities also remained unavailable, with all transactions settled in cash. Transactions involving interbank lending bills amounted to 4.2 to 4.3 million yuan for transfers in the morning market and 700,000 to 800,000 yuan for new transactions. Afternoon transactions totaled just over 300,000 yuan, and transactions in the small general association were only slightly over 400,000 yuan. Transactions involving foreign collateral loans saw limited activity in real estate, with only goods and securities being used as collateral. As a result, the amount was not significant, with redemptions and new loans totaling just over 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. Transactions involving banknotes totaled just over 1.5 million yuan. In terms of bank collections and settlements, foreign banks collected and settled bill payments totaling 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan, and various goods, exchange, collateral, and miscellaneous payments totaling 3.0 million yuan. Direct offsets for warehouse receipts and releases totaled 600,000 yuan. Chinese banks collected and settled bill payments totaling 1.9 million yuan, and various goods, exchange, tax, collateral, and miscellaneous payments totaling 4.2 million yuan, with warehouse releases of 600,000 yuan. Japanese banks collected and settled bill payments totaling 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan, and various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous payments totaling 2.8 million yuan, with warehouse releases of 400,000 yuan.

Outgoing funds were limited, with only 150,000 yuan going to the Yangtze River region. Furthermore, the total number of exchanges at the local clearinghouse on the 5th was 8,265,352.33 yuan, including 4,900,969.77 yuan in silver dollars and 3,356,182.56 yuan in interbank transfers.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Coins Fall and Copper Coins Contract Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins remained unchanged in both the morning and afternoon markets, maintaining the previous day's price of 833 yuan. Transactions were limited, with only 5,000 jiao in the morning market and a standstill in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins appeared to have fallen slightly, by 1.1 yuan, compared to the previous day, with the price quoted at 755.7 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets. Transactions totaled 45,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins contracted by 2,000 wen, to 320,500 wen, with 32,050 strings transacted, representing a value of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities US Bonds Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Company reported yesterday on the New York stock market, stating that fluctuations were slight and somewhat uneven. The Treasury Department's fourth free public debt exchange plan was proceeding along the proper channels, strengthening the US dollar. However, several stocks broke records due to special circumstances, and low-priced stocks were particularly active. Market conditions on the small exchange were firm and bullish, with the largest gains reaching around 5 yuan. Bonds rose sharply due to the Treasury Department's announcement, with US bonds up half a yuan and railroad bonds rising several jiao to 3 yuan. The company's New York agent also reported that (securities) were sluggish but uneven, with slight gains. (Wheat) Rumors of silver inflation were rampant, causing short sellers to cover their positions, and market conditions appeared to be trending higher. (Cotton) Buyers' confidence was gradually increasing. The Punkhae case was currently facing opposition, but supporters of the case predicted that it would have a successful outcome. Inflationists in Congress continued their activities. The exchange case was facing strong opposition and would likely be amended again. Russian demand remained a significant potential force. Spot prices were quiet, and trading was stable, with purchases advisable during periods of weakness. The total volume traded for the day was 1.56 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>April 3 April 4 Change</p>
<p>30 Industrials 102.74 103.19 Up 0.45</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth The Current Yarn and Cloth Market is Incredibly Dull</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains lackluster and uninspired, lacking any excitement. There is no trading in yarn futures due to the market closure. The number of people gathering in the market is as scarce as the morning stars. Although foreign cotton has seen a slight increase, it has had no impact, primarily due to the poor environment and sluggish actual sales. Furthermore, foreign merchants are dumping their goods everywhere, making it even more difficult for Chinese yarn to gain a foothold. According to statistics, all gangs bought a total of 194 bales for the day. There was no change in market conditions. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 40 Northern gang 105 Wuhu 25</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 3 Inland 11 Xiamen 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is stagnant due to the closure of the raw cotton market. With limited outlets for yarn sales, factories have no good options. Amid this market closure, news about the cotton market is particularly dull. However, US cotton has seen a slight increase of ten points.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Rises Slightly Due to Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially weakened due to selling by foreign merchants, but then strengthened due to favorable conditions in the cloth market and short covering. As a result, spot prices rose by five points, and futures prices rose by five to seven points. British cotton spot prices fell by five points, and futures prices rose by one point. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by seven points. Indian cotton was stagnant and unremarkable, with Pingguor falling by one and a half rupees, Omla falling by one rupee and seven and a half jiao, and Bairoxi falling by half a rupee. Original telegraphs are recorded below: (4th telegram)</p>

<h3>Grains Shanghai South Rice Market Shows No Ups or Downs</h3>
<p>Shanghai North Did Not Open the斛 Yesterday</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) The source of goods for all gangs yesterday was relatively scarce, totaling approximately twenty companies (three thousand余石). In terms of sales, both 天雨 and 另两胃 saw slackness, and the situation was quiet and the market settled. The 粳 rice prices for 常帮苏同南 and others in this street showed no ups or downs. Although the 包胃 of 青角松泗西练 and other late rice varieties continued to move, as the 北洋帮 did not show a weakening interest, only purchasing 1,400 to 1,500包, it was still difficult for market conditions to improve, so prices remained stable. The 去路 of 杜羊尖 turned dull, showing slight softness, but prices still showed no ups or downs. Both 阴变元供求 were rare, and prices were still balanced.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) The goods arriving from all ports yesterday were extremely rare, only a little more than ten companies. Sales were 清淡 due to disputes over 斛师酒资, which had not yet been resolved, and the holiday of 清明. Both buyers and sellers did not enter the market. The issue of 斛师 is expected to be resolved soon, and sales will definitely improve. There was no market yesterday.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Sluggish Sales Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Raw Peanuts Opened with 2,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market continued to decline. The source of goods was continuous but not surging, and the demand from factories was also weak. Market sentiment was fluctuating, and prices continued to fall by two to three points. The future prospects are feared to be more declines than gains. Yesterday, a total of 200 bags of 正阳关 beans were traded, purchased by exporters in this street. Two cars of 归德 beans were opened, and distributed by domestic merchants in this street. 350 bags of 颖州 beans and 400 bags of 肥河 beans were opened, all processed by merchants in this street. There were also 100 bags of Dalian Sipingjie beans, which were reportedly taken by domestic merchants. The raw peanut market, after a temporary increase due to reports of rising产地 prices, has returned to sluggishness as Cantonese merchants only buy at low prices. Reportedly, two batches were opened the night before, including more than 1,000 bags of 州山货 at a price of 3.55 yuan, and over 900 bags of 州货 at a price of 3.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>High Quality Late Rice Already Opened at 8.1 Yuan</h3>
<p>Small Amount of Hunan Rice Has Recently Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival and inventory of 客秈 were both low, and all transactions were active, with prices continuing to rise. High-quality 江西機晚 rice reached 8.1 yuan yesterday. The owners of Hunan and other high-quality goods have set price limits at the产地 and did not allow for cheap sales. However, a small amount of 中关湘米 has recently been装到, and the quantity is not large. Furthermore, a portion of it is also sold with price limits, so transactions have not been robust. All day, 福州 purchased 350 bags of 機晚, 394 bags of 機靖米, 215 bags of 沙市糙米, and 380 bags of 芜湖機秈. High-quality goods, such as 機晚米, rose by nearly a 角, and all other 中次 grades continued to rise by five to seven or eight points. This street has not inquired about 客秈 due to its high price and has only purchased a small amount of 绞 at a price of 8.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Taikoo Sugar Prices Are Gradually Tightening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was relatively stable, with the volume of trade remaining unexceptional. The公会划盘 prices for 24th grade coarse granulated white sugar were 19.85 yuan for ordinary 本栈货 and 19.9 yuan for 转口货, with little change. There was also a lack of movement for 8th and 9th grade 荷赤. The prices for Taikoo Sugar B rose by five points to 20.3 yuan. The prices for other grades such as CW were 19.95 yuan, DY 19.7 yuan, and HX 19.45 yuan, all of which saw some trading. The prices for the 本厂绵白振记 1st grade were 18.4 yuan, the same price as 金心 1st grade. The prices for the remaining 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades were discounted. There was little opening for the 号盘, with 枝洋 priced at 14.75 yuan, without much upward momentum. Hainan赤 sales showed activity, and the situation for the 号盘 was not loose.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Longkou Vermicelli New Goods Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>Market Prices Are Gradually Loosening</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli sales have been sluggish recently. In addition, new goods will arrive soon, so the market trend is gradually declining. The opening prices for 客货 have also loosened, decreasing by approximately one yuan compared to before, but the 走场 is still not smooth. Yesterday, the地价划申 was reportedly more favorable, making it even more difficult for the market to turn around. The 行盘 price for genuine 奸货 is 17.5 yuan, and the price for secondary goods is 17 yuan, with a flat and weak trend.</p>
<h3>Oil Market White Tung Oil Hankou Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>In Hankou, the 洋庄 trading of white tung oil has been continuous for days, while the supply remains scarce, resulting in an increasingly tight market. After the 洋行箱 entered the market at 25 yuan, telegraphs yesterday reported that it had been sold at 25.7 yuan, and the situation remained tight, with the possibility of further increases. The recent免起鹘落 in Hankou 洋庄 tung oil is not uncommon. However, the price rises quickly and the price falls easily. The current situation is slightly different from the past because the price increase is not drastic, rising gradually, and therefore seems more stable than rapid increases. It is not as easy to compare with rapid rises and falls. However, now that the market has risen to this point, it seems unlikely that it will rise further, but a small increase is still possible. The root is stable, and it would not be easy for the prices to fall, as the basics are solid and it would be very difficult to turn the market down. It is reported that Hankou 行 opened and purchased 客货, with 襄桐 priced around 21 yuan, and 南支 at 20.78 yuan. The quantity coming is not large and there are no large volume purchases. Zhejiang tung followed Hankou tung and gradually increased. According to yesterday's news, 杭行 sold and delivered at 21.4 yuan per stone, and 金兰 various產地 have also seen increases, so its rising wind is still flourishing. There have been a few 洋庄 transactions in the local area recently, done by a certain soybean and rice merchant, with a transaction volume of about dozens of tons. In terms of inbound cargo, this can be said generally true, with a few 桐油号家 trading in 洋庄货. Sales have been slight recently, but in even smaller amounts. Domestic sales remain scattered, so despite the rise in Hankou, they are still unable to be more active in inbound cargo.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Foreign Sales of Chinese Silk are Stagnant</h3>
<p>New York Raw Silk Sales Decrease Sharply New York silk weaving factories, due to the global economic panic, have seen sluggish sales of silk fabrics, with full silk fabric inventories, so they are 工停机. Raw silk sales have decreased sharply. Yesterday, 美丝 received a telegraph from the New York silk market stating that in the past month (i.e., March), silk weaving factories in New York City only consumed a total of 28,394 packages of raw silk, only about 5/10 of that of months in previous years.</p>
<p>Ji Li Dried Silk Sales to the US are Terminated The superior Ji Li Dried Silk produced in Zhejiang and Hubei enjoyed strong sales in the US. In recent years, due to poor manufacturing, it has been almost entirely infringed upon by Japanese silk sales. Ji Li Dried Silk has become extinct in the New York market. This year, no Dried Silk was shipped to the US in the first three months. Recently, there were only three packages of Huzhou Baitusi shipped to Seattle, reportedly new silk samples.</p>
<p>Yangzhuang Silk Market is Lifeless The overseas raw silk market has a large raw silk inventory, and consumption is decreasing daily. The actual sales in Lyon and other places are stagnant, and New York silk prices will be difficult to sustain. The import merchants are eager to sell their raw silk inventory, but the Shanghai factory has not responded to the telegraph. The Yangzhuang silk market is still lifeless. Yesterday, only Dachang and others purchased ten packages of 黄厂经 and five packages of 灰经, but prices remained depressed.</p>

<p>Shanghai News Additional Supplement</p>
<h3>Casual Remarks</h3>
<h3>On the Issue of Prisoners' Sexual Desires</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, all the newspapers competed to publish a fresh piece of news: [A Reuters dispatch from Guangzhou Nanhiong authorities recently received a petition from prisoners sentenced to long-term imprisonment, requesting that the authorities allow the prisoners' families to enter the prison on time to cohabitate, so as to pass on descendants. The petition also cited Confucius' saying, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest." It is heard that the authorities intend to reject this request, believing that Chinese judicial system does not have a provision that a prisoner's wife can enter the prison to cohabitate with her husband:]: etc.</p>
<p>This piece of news is truly extremely novel and strange. I do not know whether the various civilized countries already have explicit regulations that a prisoner's wife can enter the prison on a regular basis to cohabitate with her husband? If there is such a fact, then, I think the judicial authorities, in addition to building prisons, should also build a number of secret rooms, so that those prisoners' wives can enter the prison on a regular basis to cohabitate with their husbands, so that they can pass on the family line. This would be immeasurable merit and a virtue of cherishing life.</p>
<p>The use of Confucius' saying, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest," as a banner in the petition, I think they are worthy of having [read Confucius' books] and [reached the rites of the Duke of Zhou]. Indeed, even though they are in prison, they still diligently remember to pass on the family line. It can be seen that they are indeed great filial sons (?): admirable, admirable! However, did Confucius consider this for prisoners when he said this? If not, then I cannot help but speak up for the injustice he suffered. However, I also thought of those prisoners who are not married, what methods should they use to pass on the family line? This is a major issue.</p>
<p>A long time ago! I remember that Luo Wengan once published an opinion on the issue of liberating prisoners' sexual desires. At that time, it also caused the newspapers to publish it. He had already submitted the main idea and motive of this issue to the Executive Yuan for approval, and planned to first implement it on a trial basis in inland prisons, and then promote it nationwide after it was confirmed that no malpractices occurred. [For prisoners sentenced to long-term imprisonment, if it is determined that they have a marital relationship, they may cohabitate in prison within a specified period.] After this news came out, there were criticisms from the general public. The reason is that prisoners' behavior is bad, and the transmission of their bad heredity, even if conception occurs, will not produce a good race. Moreover, at that time, both parties were in a depressed and sad environment, and their thoughts may not have been happy. In the future, the impact on the future of the race is not small. Whether their families are willing to enter the prison and cohabitate with them is another question, but the limitations of time are also an unavoidable fact.</p>
<p>Later, Luo's proposal was not approved by the Executive Yuan, so it dissipated into smoke and became a bubble. Over time, everyone gradually forgot about this matter. Now, the prisoners in Guangzhou have unexpectedly submitted such a petition, which can be said to be in response to Luo's proposal. Unfortunately, however, it was strongly rejected by the Guangzhou authorities; this is like a bucket of cold water pouring down from the top of their heads, chilling all their hopes.</p>
<p>However, I also heard that in the Japanese legal system, there is indeed such a fact. If a prisoner is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year, his family members can go to a designated secret room every week to have a rendezvous with her husband. But, I don't know if it is a fact?</p>
<h3>My Hometown</h3>
<p>— Naishuo</p>
<p>My hometown is not Xiangxiang, but the small Yongfeng.</p>
<p>In Xiangxiang County, under the fame of Zeng Xiangxiang, the county town is so desolate and deserted. The rows of shops are only the residences of merchants, and they cannot create the outline of a commercial city. Yongfeng, although it is such a small town, has a strong commercial force. It has the convenience of boats and ships on the water, and cars speeding on land, and it also controls a military stronghold. Although there are not many shops || equivalent to Jiangwan Town, its substance is more than ten times better.</p>
<p>It was exactly ten years ago, in the early autumn, that I went to Yongfeng to study at a high school thirty miles away from the neighboring town. Speaking of this high school, it is not like the small elementary schools in Shanghai with one or two floors or even only a pavilion room. It is simply better than the general middle schools in Shanghai. It has spacious school buildings and hundreds of acres of foundation. The Girls' Vocational School facing the river is so mysterious! Their power is truly boundless. I remember that in our boys' school in those years, there was such a prohibition: [In the evening, students are not allowed to linger on the opposite bank of the girls' school when they go out for a walk.] Speaking of our high school, it has educated many people.</p>
<p>Many revolutionary generals of the contemporary era have visited and stayed in our Yongfeng, and sown countless revolutionary seeds. We even personally welcomed the troops and provided food and drink. We climbed on the generals' carriages and received their kind nods and smiles. We even went crazy and propagated all over the streets. I remember in those years, our pure hearts only had the illusion of hoping for the success of the revolution!</p>
<p>The commerce there is surprisingly prosperous, with southern goods piled up like mountains, Jiangxi's large pharmacies, and transfer companies. It is the central point for local products from all over, and also the distribution point for foreign goods. When it dawns, the citizens crowd the streets like a swarm of bees. Late at night, in addition to the sound of the watchman's clapper, you can also subtly appreciate the night pilgrimage of the local opera troupe. There has never been a famine, so I don't know what it means to be in a recession.</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking, it seems like a pure country girl with a sacred heart, only seeing the exuberant joy of life, and no deep atmosphere of dusk.</p>
<p>This is the scene from ten years ago.</p>
<p>It has also become the scene from ten years ago, it's the past!</p>
<p>And now, it is truly [unbearable to look back on those years]! Last year, I went back, and I only had an excited mood along the way. Who knew that after meeting, it was so surprising!</p>
<p>A lively and bustling city has turned into a desolate and deserted market, and the original shops, although they are still struggling to maintain themselves, everyone has reached the tip of decline.</p>
<p>On the street, you can only see dogs fighting, and the roofs are where crows and magpies crow. The prosperity of ten years ago has disappeared to who knows where.</p>
<p>What is new is that whenever a car drives into the station, there are more groups of vendors shouting, more semi-Westernized hotels and warehouses, and a group of Western-suited teenagers strolling on the street.</p>
<p>Recently, I have received several pieces of news from my hometown, all saying that it has become like an old woman who is about to die.</p>
<p>Recently, I have also met several fellow villagers who have just fled from their hometown. As soon as we meet and talk about Yongfeng, everyone can only shake their heads. They don't talk about the decline of the countryside or the recession of the market, but only say in unison:</p>
<p>[One round of war and one round of disaster, my hometown is unbearable to inquire about!]</p>
<h3>Returning Late from Bai Causeway</h3>
<p>— Qingmu</p>
<p>A round of maiden-like delicate sun has shyly hidden behind the peak over there. Slices of colorful clouds, rich in curves, also seem to be eagerly seeking a partner to find their home. At that time, Bai Causeway was covered with fragrant and beautiful footprints, and pairs of young men and women, talented scholars and beautiful women, were holding hands and talking sweetly under the shade of the willow trees by the causeway. The cunning fish in the lake also learned from them, whispering to each other, lingering and reluctant to leave, truly envying us single men.</p>
<p>Generally, old ladies and pilgrims, hanging yellow sachets, returned from Lingyin and Tianzhu temples after offering incense, praying for more fortune and longevity, and for offspring to be successful. I lonely tour this scenic spot on the causeway, Fanghe Pavilion, Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake, Xiling Seal Engravers' Society, which only added to my sorrow. This was originally a place for poets and hermits to taste tea and write poetry, but now, it is crowded with people and full of vulgarity, like a teahouse on the sea! They were originally enough to add color to the lake and mountains, but now they have become superfluous.</p>
<p>The moon is gradually rising, which is a sign that prompts me to return. I haven't walked so much today, but at this time I already feel tired and exhausted, how useless. Tomorrow I must get up early to look at the beautiful scenery of the Qiantang River sunrise from the Wangyang Terrace. Although there will be another opportunity tomorrow, but where in our life is there any hope for the future, except for what has already arrived before our eyes.</p>
<p>In an unguarded moment, suddenly the lingering sounds from the guesthouse opposite our room that had been tightly closed yesterday promoted my eardrums. I don't know what kind of magic power it seemed to attract my attention. I looked down from the gap in the window, but only a very blurry phantom-like phenomenon was printed into my eyes, like a pair of angel-like lovers, embracing and kissing tightly. From the movements on their appearance, I am afraid that they are not a formal pair of mandarin ducks? Such enthusiasm, I am afraid, will also envy the Bodhisattva in the Buddha Hall over there, let alone us single men: but I already know love, love that can now be bought with gold!</p>
<p>Ah, love, I advise you to stop talking about love!</p>
<p>Do you have plenty of gold in your pocket?</p>
<p>If you are still a poor scholar,</p>
<p>I advise you not to tease the flirtatious!</p>
<h3>Reading Notes from the Shen Bao Circulating Library</h3>
<p>— Guanghan</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Circulating Library was established on the third floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road. Although it has only been open for more than a year, the results have been quite impressive. Because the location is suitable and the transportation is convenient, it is extremely crowded every day with people who come to the library to borrow books or read magazines and newspapers. Although my residence is far from this place, I am always in the habit of running to the library whenever I go out for something or when I am bored, and casually flipping through a few pages of magazines or newspapers. Last Wednesday afternoon, I made a special [visit] to spend most of the day.</p>
<p>After receiving a copper tag from the entrance, I selected an issue of the "Eastern Miscellany" from the bookshelf and settled down in an empty seat in the reading room. Before I opened the book to read, I raised my head and looked around. Today, there are probably more than twenty readers. There are those who look like students, those who are in the professional world, and those who are dressed like workers. [A touch of red amidst the green], coincidentally, among many men, there is a lady mixed in. They are either sitting or standing, reading magazines or newspapers, and pairs of eyes are all focused on the books and volumes arranged on the table or held in their hands, as if they are looking for some secret.</p>
<p>After I finished reading the two articles I wanted to read, I wanted to find another piece of literature that I wanted to read, but it was gone, it had already been taken by someone who was faster. So I went to the borrowing desk to fill out a borrowing slip, hoping to borrow one or two volumes of social sciences to read, but unexpectedly, I wrote four book titles in a row, but none of them were borrowed. Helpless, I had to flip through the daily newspapers. After a while, I borrowed a copy of "China's Grand View" to read. People left and came to the reading room for a while, and more people came than left.</p>
<p>The time was already 5:25, and I felt mentally exhausted, so I returned the copper tag and stepped out of the reading room. At this moment, there were still many people standing outside the window waiting to borrow books, and the clerks in the library looked very busy.</p>
<p>In the elevator, a question suddenly popped into my mind: Why don't these people go to the amusement park to have fun when they are free, but instead come here to sit and ponder, and stare at the books in a daze? Oh! I understand, it turns out that human life, in addition to material sustenance, also needs spiritual food. Spiritual hunger is as uncomfortable as emptiness in the stomach. And the library is a place to provide [spiritual food], no wonder countless people with a desire for knowledge like to run here, hoping to get some spiritual satisfaction from here.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Circulating Library, this [public spiritual canteen], is a social enterprise held by Shen Bao on the occasion of its 60th anniversary. This [canteen] is providing nutrients to a group of people with spiritual famine, which is very beneficial to the public. We hope that it can expand and develop day by day, and prepare a variety of [rare delicacies and fine wines] in abundance, so as to feast the general [hungry and thirsty], so that people in society will not feel the risk of spiritual cold and hunger, then the contribution to culture will not be small!</p>

<h3>On Women's Sports</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>For thousands of years, women have been confined by stale and antiquated traditions. Apart from being deeply imprisoned in the family, serving as slaves and beasts of burden, they had no way to create and develop their own urgent undertakings. Where would they have the leisure to discuss sports, which they considered an extra issue, and to actually practice it? Because at that time, strict feudal ideas bound their minds. Except for a small number of women, most simply did not know this term existed. Some even thought that it was not something women could enjoy. It seemed that the social system at that time had already predetermined women's fate. It was not considered unfortunate for them to be deprived of this right, and it was even considered a matter of course. Women could only stay in the depths of their boudoirs, serving as beasts of burden and slaves to men!</p>
<p>With the eastward spread of European customs and after several waves of women's movements, the old system gradually collapsed along with this turbulent current. All kinds of new phenomena rose up. The call for women's sports and the advocacy of women's sports became increasingly responsive. The derogatory terms previously used such as "sick women of the East" and "sickly beauties" were replaced with a new requirement for healthy beauty. Objectively, we certainly cannot deny the astonishing progress of women's sports in recent years! Women's sports competitions have been successively launched in various provinces and counties, and women compatriots who have been imprisoned in dark hells for thousands of years have been promoted to the battlefield one after another, demonstrating their respective skills. In particular, last year's grand and magnificent National Games, which cost tens of thousands of capital, built a solemn and majestic sports field in Nanjing. Each province selected so many amazing female heroes to perform on the field. We cannot deny the general factual proof of the progress of women's sports. This time, the international women's basketball team, with their intelligence and courage, and with their hearts and minds exhausted, defeated Britain by a score of thirty-four to twenty-seven, and regained the international women's championship in this city, not falling into the hands of blue-eyed people, which is really gratifying. Such earth-shattering progress, in the current state of extreme decline of national spirit, cannot but be said to be a new phenomenon. Especially for the just budding future of women's sports, what a fortunate thing is it?</p>
<p>As a result of the poor social organization, all phenomena are deformed and morbid. Although the above mentioned some facts about the development and progress of women's sports, how many places and schools are still waiting for this kind of facility! Therefore, although women's sports have some achievements, they have not progressed to all places and spread to the generally oppressed women:</p>
<p>Art is a beautiful phenomenon that restores people's fatigue; similarly, sports are also aimed at strengthening the body. At present, because of the unsound general system and organization, sports have not been soundly implemented in every individual, but are deformed and partial. In particular, women's sports are a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>In many villages not far from the cities, can we not often see women who have lost their natural feet, passed down from thousands of years of tradition, still suffering there, suffering from this genetic disease? Therefore, we know that the so-called development of women's sports is just a modern slogan and decoration for a part of the people in the city.</p>
<p>We should absolutely advocate sports, especially women's sports, which is a matter of urgency and needs to be revitalized! In the future, how should we popularize women's sports so that women who have been oppressed and imprisoned in jail-like conditions for thousands of years can enjoy this right and embark on the road to health!</p>
<h3>On Women</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Women are naturally born for men, and men can never do without women. The relationship between the two is understood even by children, so there is no need to say more. The existence of women is like a shadow following the body, and they cannot be separated in any way. If there were no women to embellish the world, it would become a desolate desert. Not only would men not be able to survive, but humanity would have ended long ago. So when you talk about women, when you see women, you always can't help but smile and become excited for no reason, unless you are a piece of insensitive wood. Indeed, women are the source of life, more important than firewood and rice, the world would not be the world without them, the magic of women is incredible. Every frown and smile of a woman is worth a thousand gold pieces, but its harm often arises from this, the so-called benefit must have its drawbacks. Often for that light frown and smile, you are so mesmerized that you throw all the big things to the back of your mind, even if you die or your family is ruined, you don't care. There is even the saying that "one glance can overthrow a city, and another glance can overthrow a country." In history, many昏庸昏庸kings have lost their country and extinct their race because of a mere woman's body. Some people often only think that "beautiful colors are important in the world," and raise women up to the clouds, willing to be cattle and horses under pomegranate skirts, wholeheartedly indulging in the beauty's den. And they have never thought about the terrible harm that women can cause. Knowing that it is drinking poison to quench thirst, they still drink it indifferently, and die without realizing it. Even if they are harmed by women and become fragmented, desolate and miserable, they still do not regret it, but still worship them, chase them, and enshrine them as sacred and dignified objects. This is truly worthy of tears.</p>
<p>Women are certainly very necessary, but it is necessary to add considerable contempt to them, and not to regard them as so mysterious and so noble, so that they can reflect more and dare not forget to be proud and reserved, and regard themselves as great figures. Because if you value them too much, they will look down on everything and ride you as a beast of burden. Moreover, you are a human being, are you willing to use your majestic seven-foot body as a beast of burden, and not feel ashamed?</p>
<p>Women are indeed naturally beautiful things, more harmful than beneficial. Since they cannot be dispensed with, and cannot be too much, it is really a bit like chicken ribs, tasteless to eat, but a pity to throw away. They are very good at being妖妖冶冶. If you are too considerate and polite, she will actually climb on your head and defecate. Of course, I do not absolutely slander women. I have always kept myself pure, and do not learn from the mad bees and wandering butterflies. Therefore, I have never been fooled by women, and I am not qualified to talk about unrequited love. So my relationship with women can be said to be without hatred or resentment, without hatred or love. However, I often see a group of people serving women almost as if they were serving their ancestors and parents, with the feeling that "everything else is inferior, only women are good," doing their best to endure humiliation. What I have heard and witnessed makes me feel infinitely感嘆. People's hearts are not ancient, and rivers are declining day by day. I am really disgusted, so I will do some counter-articles, so that "those who only know that there are women and do not know that there are other things, the only-womenists, do not live such a confused life,糊裏糊塗 making women's sacrifices, leaving a bad name for ten thousand years. Women are certainly important, but also remember that women can call people to ruin their reputation and die without a burial place. For this, if you can taste it carefully, there is a great truth in it, and you can gain endless benefits, and make you change your improper respect for women."</p>

<h3>From Venereal Diseases to Youthful Sexual Frustration</h3>
<p>｜Editor's Note｜</p>
<p>Three letters discussing this issue have already been published, and the remaining letters will not be published because their meanings are similar. Moreover, this discussion has been going on for more than a week. Even if the readers are not tired of it, they are probably eagerly awaiting the editor to draw a conclusion with an "old face"! It is also very ashamed to say that I dare not say what I wanted to say with an old face now, I am a little shy, because if everyone does not feel depressed about this issue, the world and the sexual depression, that is, the depression is not to seek catharsis from indulgence, the solution is very easy, but if the depression is inevitable, the sexual desire has no reasonable solution, then it is difficult. Therefore, although the editor's previous views on this issue are still not considered wrong by himself, he is still a little unsure whether it can prevent young people from taking this risk again. Why? Because this issue is not an independent issue, but is caused by the current social chaos, the pain of people's lives, etc., that is, it is a reflection of the defects of the current social system, so its reasonable solution is after the entire social problem is solved, in other words, once the entire social problem is solved, this is fundamentally not a problem.</p>
<p>Why is this issue related to the entire social problem? The reason is this: The cause of venereal diseases is "prostitution." (Generally speaking) But why prostitute? Then there are two situations, one kind of person is full of food all day, idle and bored, and can not spend the time on business, proper entertainment, so "eating, drinking, prostitution, gambling" are all coming: another kind of person is because the age has reached or exceeded puberty, the need for sex has felt very urgent, but economically does not allow him to marry, or has a wife, but can not live together, to give reasonable satisfaction to sexual desire, so knowing that prostitution is dishonorable, is dangerous, also has to ignore everything, drink poison to quench thirst, take the risk to do this kind of thing. The former kind of person is not caused by sexual desire depression, although their nonsense is also due to environmental pressure, after all, they are not good themselves, so the editor does not think for them, the object discussed in this article is only the latter situation.</p>
<p>Now first say whether the frustration of sexual desire is a must for a person to satisfy because of sexual impulses. In the editor's opinion, this is not necessarily the case. Of course, sexual desire is human nature, and human beings must have it with considerable satisfaction, but the urgent desires or demands of people are not only sexual desire, just like the sentence "food and sex are also", but also have to be crowned with food, from which it can be seen that the requirement of sexual desire is not the whole of a person's requirements. Moreover, human desires are graded, and human beings must first satisfy the most important desires and then gradually extend to the important, secondary, etc. ["This is the explanation of the psychological school in economics for desire, and it is correct from a psychological point of view, but if it is applied to economics, it is wrong, but that is another matter, we do not need to pursue it. ) The proverb "When you are full and warm, you think of lust, when you are hungry and cold, you have the heart to steal" is also the same principle, so like our general poor masses, since we can not marry a wife because of the difficulty of life, we can not reasonably solve sexual desire, then it is better to put all his spirit and energy on improving the life and liberating the economy, etc. Moreover, in psychology, there is also the so-called transfer principle, that is, a person is forced in a certain aspect, can not make progress, he can put the spiritual effort to another aspect to seek development. The editor had such an experience when he was studying at the university, that is, all the male and female students who were ugly and economically not very affluent had to work harder and more diligently in their studies. Because they can not make a show of themselves in terms of appearance and economic conditions, they have to find another way out and find a way to show their faces. Therefore, although the editor does not ignore the importance of sexual desire like the general ascetics, he advocates that those who can not reasonably solve sexual desire should simply not solve it and do some effective work and things that can achieve the goal. It seems that this does not violate human nature, and may not be able to see it in practice!</p>
<p>Secondly, we will talk about the social reasons. Many people can not think of a way to improve or a way to struggle because of the蹇舛of their circumstances, the苦悶of their lives, and the窮困of their lives, so they simply ignore everything, embracing the attitude of 信陵君fine wine and women, and enjoying themselves to the fullest. Moreover, because of sexual impulses, absurd behaviors are mostly erotic pursuits. We see that Mr. Zhong Dai Er, who has personally experienced the pain of venereal diseases, attaches great importance to the pain of life and the hardships of the world, so we can know that the main cause of [prostitution] is not only [sexual desire], or even social reasons are the main cause, and [sexual desire] is just an誘質, because sexual desire is only the motive of [wanting to prostitute], and that kind of self-abandonment psychology is the resolution of [going to prostitute]. Therefore, we should pay great attention to this level: but this is generally speaking about society, saying that the prevalence of [prostitution] or [lascivious customs] in society, the spread of venereal diseases, is not [the world is not ancient] [people's hearts are greatly bad] but there are other objective reasons, it is possible, if individuals take this reason as a guise to forgive themselves, it is absolutely impossible. Because the bad social system and the pain of life are indeed the reasons for the degeneration of young people, but there is a way out in front of us, there is a fighting direction for us to get rid of these shackles, we not only do not need to be passive and颓废, but also passive and颓废, fundamentally is a kind of [slow killing, ] can never reduce the pain of the environment, but will increase it, so that you can not bear it (about passive and颓废, should be discussed separately, here do not say more) Therefore, young people who indulge in sensuality because of this, it is their own fault, which we can not tolerate.</p>
<p>In short, what the editor wants to tell the general youth in one sentence is: sexual impulses or frustrations are not harmful, only your own inability to cheer up is the main cause of making you step on the crisis.</p>
<p>Finally, the editor is deeply admired for the gentlemen who came to discuss the matter; they can sincerely tell the readers the pain they have felt, they can contribute methods with a spirit of service, all of which are rare spirits and attitudes in the current society. Editor</p>

<h3>Rambling Tales of Siam (5)</h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>No Wife Without Being a Monk</p>
<p>In our country, being a monk is the most pitiful thing. Except for a few people who have seen through the mortal world and are willing to become monks themselves, most of them are sent to temples by their parents since they were young because of their poor family background, forcing him to spend those years without the joy of life, which does not seem very humane. Occasionally, one or two people can not stand the physiological pressure, and have to do some stealing chickens and dogs, and the society will责he does not abide by the rules, and even be subject to legal sanctions. But it is not the case in Siam: not only can monks have sons and daughters, but also have no qualifications to marry without being a monk. Therefore, none of the people in the country do not want to be a monk once, even if they are贵as kings, they have to shave their hair and live in the temple for a month or two. However, there are also many monks who are unwilling to return to俗. The reason for this is not that they despise情欲and discard尘缘. Originally Siam is a Buddhist country, and the status of monks is much higher than that of ordinary people. At the same time, the temples have huge temple properties, which can be used for them to squander. And although they do not marry wives, the problem of sex can still be solved semi-openly. Therefore, the Siamese monks who only consume but do not produce are also increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Every day at five or six o'clock in the morning, we can see monks wearing yellow robes and carrying iron bowls walking quickly, not looking at anything else, on any street, which is their daily alms collection.善男信女 see the monks coming, they hurry to run in front of him, and offer the prepared white rice, incense, coconut, or other foods with both hands. If the monk is willing to receive your offering with an iron bowl, you have to put your palms together and thank him. Even more strangely, every monk must have a young boy following him when he goes out, holding an umbrella for him in the sun and carrying a bag for him to buy things. It is really arrogant as凡! If you compare our country's monks with them, the 距离實在 is simply immeasurable.</p>

<h3>A Man Who Died and Came Back to Life Describes the Taste of Entering Eternal Life</h3>
<p>— Xi Leng</p>
<p>Edward Robinson's Experience</p>
<p>Can be used as scientific reference material</p>
<p>What does death feel like? What sensations does it have? What thoughts does a person have when the dark curtain gradually covers the window of his senses? What reactions are there? I dare say that few of us have this experience. But Edward Robinson (Edward G. Robinson) has had this experience, and now</p>
<p>can still talk to us. He is a man who died and came back to life, as dead as a corpse, but was actually saved and came back to talk to us, what is the reaction of a person when he walks into the border of the second world. This is of course a rare miracle.</p>
<p>Saying that Robinson died and came back to life is not an absurd thing. He drowned. His heart stopped beating. He had indeed reached the "Valley of Death." His body had no trace of vitality. The doctors all said he was already dead. In short, he was no longer in this world. But later, using artificial methods, the water filling his lungs was lifted out, his stopped heart was moved, and the sensations in his brain were restored. At that time, he was just a child, but he still remembers clearly every thought, every reaction, in the few minutes of entering eternal life.</p>
<p>At that time, he was still studying at the affiliated elementary school of the Municipal Middle School of New York. At that time, students of the affiliated elementary school could swim in the gymnasium of the middle school within a certain time. Because Edward was too enthusiastic about learning to swim, he exceeded the prescribed time. A swimming instructor, in order to make him remember not to exceed the prescribed time, wanted to punish him a little. "At that time," Edward said, "I had just exhaled and was about to inhale oxygen when my two feet were suddenly grabbed and dragged under the water. In this way, with a gurgle, his lungs were filled with water. At that time, the窒息of terror, the frantic struggle, wanted to透out of the water and get some air, but there was no strength. Of course, I knew I was going to drown. The instructor didn't care what he had done, and swam happily to the side, waiting for me to come up by myself. But I didn't come up. It wasn't until I stopped struggling and lay motionless at the bottom of the pool that they realized I had drowned."</p>
<p>So they hurriedly carried him up. At that time, they knew it was too late, because the pulse was gone, the breathing had stopped completely, and the heart was not beating. They quickly summoned a doctor, who said Edward was dead, but for the sake of万一, he ordered artificial respiration to be tried. So they used artificial respiration, and after almost an hour, there was still no movement. They thought it was really hopeless. Suddenly his pulse beat a little. After another while, his lungs actually inhaled some air that was more precious than anything in the world. In this way, his soul, which had entered the underworld, returned to the world of the living. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Film Review</h3>
<h3>Review of [Wind]</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>｜Jin Cheng Reflection｜</p>
<p>[Wind] is being promoted by Lianhua Film Company as an exceptional masterpiece, hence making us greatly concerned and eagerly anticipating it.</p>
<p>Indeed, [Wind] is worthy of attention. Whether it be the author's ideology or the author's method of expression, both make us hold great interest in this new director, Mr. Wu Cun. Precisely because of this, out of our love for a progressive writer, we dare not neglect his work in the slightest. That is to say, we will frankly criticize any aspect of his work, so that he may know our demands through our opinions. This, we believe, the author will openly accept, because we recognize him as someone capable of accommodating others' opinions.</p>
<p>This is a very obvious fact: we can see in [Wind] the author harboring great enthusiasm. He has deep resentment towards the upper class, and he has full sympathy for the lower class. However, he himself belongs neither to the upper class nor to the group of the poor; he is, after all, an enlightened intellectual of the middle class. Thus, determined by his own life and environmental awareness, he can only offer slight mockery to those he resents, and at the same time, he can only offer well-intentioned sympathy to the laboring masses.</p>
<p>Ultimately, due to the scope of his life, the author has no opportunity to deeply understand the upper class. Similarly, he is unwilling to find opportunities to further understand the lower class. Thus, he relies solely on his own intelligence to imagine and speculate. Therefore, even if he enthusiastically places all his hopes on the laboring masses, he cannot express it more truthfully. Moreover, he cannot abandon the poetic sentiments of a petty-bourgeois author. Thus, at a time when extremely strong techniques are needed to deal with the great issues of destruction and construction, all he can do is superficially expose or mock the collapsing ugliness, and on the other hand, he cannot find his center of gravity to promote and glorify. To put it more plainly, he has not grasped the truth of either side. He is merely unfolding his own fantasy; his film work is but empty poetry.</p>
<p>It is very obvious that he uses symbolic techniques to create the film. The ode to the storm becomes the main focus of his work. The drunkard played by Wang Guilin, the big fellow played by Yin Xiucen, the sailor worker played by Gao Zhanfei, and the vase played by Tan Ying are almost entirely characters of fantasy. Wang Ming's [Candlelit Night Tour], Xiao Ming cutting up his sister's clothes, the gentleman Mr. Yin holding an umbrella at night, and so on, may all have profound meanings for the author, but to us, they seem to be the actions of madmen. What we demand is the reality of society, and even more so, a method of expression that is [more real than reality]. As for Shao Zhen's journey from self-confusion to [enlightenment], although her process is quite natural, it is only a phenomenon of a very small number. Moreover, her so-called [enlightenment] is also worth considering.</p>
<p>In the film, we do not see the conflict of interest between the two classes. We do not understand the reasons and results for detaining contraband. These are, of course, due to the author's lack of further understanding of social phenomena, and on the other hand, also due to the author's insufficient expression skills.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, we might as well put forward a few more concrete opinions. Presumably because the author is still a novice, his editing of the scenes is not accomplished enough. This should be the main shortcoming of [Wind]: redundancy, the process of unfolding the story, is not concise and clear enough. The former can be exemplified by Xiao Zhen hiding behind the rockery and Mr. Yin being unable to get out of the cave. The latter is a common problem. In particular, before and after the storm, he wants to simultaneously depict three tense scenes: the night garden party, the warehouse door, and Wang Ming and his son. Such a scene is extremely difficult to handle. If you take care of one thing, you lose sight of another, making it very difficult to create tension. In fact, he took care of the compactness of the night garden party, and the warehouse door lost its time montage. In short, from beginning to end, it cannot give us a clear feeling. Although we are not unable to understand it, the disorganized editing leads to the loss of consistent solemn emotion, which is an irreparable loss to the work. Therefore, if we believe that this film lacks emotion, in addition to the lack of realism, the author's lack of research on montage is also the main reason for the failure.</p>
<p>However, the author's intelligence is an indelible fact. The beauty of the shots, the beautification of each character's actions, and the control of each scene all show that there is great hope for the future. Of course, in the meantime, we will certainly not overlook the success of the photography and the greatness of the set design.</p>
<p>However, small shortcomings should also be pointed out by us, such as many characters similarly moving a fan or invitation from their face to reveal their face, which makes people feel annoyed; the handling of tasteless gimmicks, such as the manager's unreasonable explanation of the misunderstanding on the widow's staircase before leaving; some dialogues not being fluent enough or the words being wrong; Xiao Zhen coming out from behind the screen twice, and the unreasonable timing of the first sensual reflection in the mirror; Xiao Zhen eavesdropping beside the manager and the widow without being seen by them; many people lighting lanterns after the storm; the close-up of Wang Ming and his son in the end not being understood by the general audience, and so on, are all worth studying. Also, the shipowner pouring wine on Wang Ming's head, because there is no shot of it pouring down, is also misleading. This was probably cut out.</p>
<p>We believe that this film must have been cut to some extent, resulting in disorganization. More obviously, the author was overly concerned with the environment, so that he could not speak freely. Regarding this point, we can naturally greatly forgive the author, but at the same time, we must also be responsible to the audience and society!</p>
<p>Finally, we have to talk about the acting skills of some actors. We were greatly surprised when we saw Tan Ying's performance. She has Garbo's mystery, and also has lovely lively postures. We hope that she will work hard in this area. Gao Zhanfei did not show any special talents due to the limitations of the script, and Wang Guilin was also mediocre. In addition, Yuan Congmei performed well; he is indeed an actor who can act.</p>
<p>For every staff member of this film, we privately congratulate ourselves on discovering many surprises, but because our expectations are high, our demands are also a little too earnest.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Pi Jian Ying Lu (Nana) (One)</h3>
<p>— Yin Ming</p>
<p>On that brocade-piled, gold-glorious large sofa, Nana lay prostrate, burying her face in the velvet cushion. After a while, her head lifted, and she smiled sweetly at Greiner. She said, [Too soft::: too fragrant::: I love this fragrance::: ] Her voice was delicate and weak, and she lazily hugged the cushion. The sofa she was lying on was originally made of duck down, but Nana was not surprised at all. In fact, just a month ago, she was still sleeping on a straw mat. At that time, she slept in the kitchen during the day and roamed the streets at night. Unexpectedly, her lucky star shone, and she met a benefactor, the old Mr. Greiner, who was one of the most powerful theater owners in Paris. He turned her into a great actress. But Nana felt neither surprised nor grateful, and had no impression at all. The things she had encountered in her life, in all their variety, she treated with indifference and equanimity. For example, not long ago, on one such day, she watched her mother's thin body, after being brutally murdered, buried in a mass grave. She watched her mother's body being lowered, and she was unmoved. People who knew her cursed her, saying that she had no conscience. And another day, even more recently, that dawn, she heard that snap, that the sharp guillotine blade came down and severed her father's head, as retribution for her mother's murder. Other women would faint upon hearing the sound, but Nana watched it all, then slowly walked away. She ran to a café, ordered a glass of red wine, and savored the taste.</p>
<p>Until later, Greiner met her, noticed her exquisite appearance, and asked her to come to his theater, she agreed without hesitation. In fact, she did not feel anything special in her heart. In her ice-cold mood, she only had a slight memory that often disturbed her in her chest. It was a lingering image of a face. She had only seen him once - in that [Seven Striped Fish Café]. He had not said anything either. He was a young military officer, with a group of friends. Nana, well - also had many friends, Mimi and Gudin.</p>
<p>In Nana's daily life, she liked people to know what kind of person she was. This made it easier for people to approach her. But that night, the young military officer's eyes fixed on her. He unconsciously felt shy, and she wished she could wear more clothes and show less of her original posture on her face. Gudin had even said at the time: [What money do soldiers have!] Unexpectedly, Nana, upon hearing Gudin mention money, became furious and argued with Gudin. Thinking back to things before Nana remembered them, she shook her head as if to shake off the traces on her brain. She also put her nose close to the pillow cushion, smelling the fragrance on it. After a while, the door of the dressing room opened, and Su, who served Nana, ran in, carrying a large pile of clothes in her hands. She saw Nana lying languidly on the sofa, and shouted to Greiner: [Mr. Greiner, look at her. There is only half an hour left before the curtain rises, and she is still lying there as if nothing is happening. This is still the first time on stage. Alas, heavens, I am so anxious!] (To be continued)</p>
