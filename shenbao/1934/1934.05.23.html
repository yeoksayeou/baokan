<h3 id="c25">投資開發四川敬 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>四川夙稱天富之國。論面積。將及一百三十萬方里論人口。超過七千二百萬。而其手工業之發達。農業之進步。尤不下於東南開發較早之省區。惜歷年以來。川省以中央政府鞭長莫及。遂致形成割據。儼然中恩系統而省内軍閥。又復擁兵自重。互相水炎於國家固無所謂貢獻。於人民更未見有何裨益。長此以往。將更使小民生計。疲弊不堪。益資土匪以造亂之機會而已。尤有進者强隣之經營西藏得寸進尺。蠶食不已。今且由前藏而侵及西康西康者。川邊也。西康亡則川局益危。瞻望前途。不寒而慄矣。</p>
<p>最近中國銀行總經理張公權氏。遊歷川省。實地考察。鑒於當地寳藏豐富。鑛產除一部分銅鐵外。多未開採。若自流井及五通橋之鹽井。天然瓦斯。及副產之石油。迄今仍多沿襲土法。稍加利用。苟以近代科発知識。盡量推廣。則爲利將不可勝言。張氏考察之餘深受感動。乃有自願介紹滬上財團前往投資之說。惟此舉能否見諸實行。第一須視四川政局之安危以爲斷。而財團眼光之遠近次之。任何高見遠矚之士。當知我國今日險象環生。前途荆棘正多。若川省之工業組織。固不易與人爭一日之短長。卽鄉村農產。亦感受傾銷之壓迫。欲救解除當前之困。厄尋覓將來之出路。則吸收資本。從事開發。自爲要圖。再就投資家之利益着想。投資四川。爲利至溥。蓋川省人烟稠密。人工之後備非常雄厚。而農業又相當發達食糧亦足以自給。同時川省本身卽抲爲出產品之消塲。交通亦有長江水運之便。凡此種種。皆爲其他邊省所不常見者。張氏之提倡投資。豈無故哉。</p>
<p>然私人投資。終不免於若干冒險性。投資者最先之所考慮。自爲資本安全問題。次乃及於利潤問題。今日四川之局面。至不穩定。人所共知。欲謀新興事業之安全。實無把握。設有軍隊爲奥援。容或可能。然川閥之交替極速。而事業經營。動須十年二十年之期間。則仍無補於實際。而况軍閥朝三暮四。不盡可恃乎。或者曰。目前川局已漸趨於統一。不知二劉之間并未完全諒解。鄧田楊諸軍。依然割據一方。而赤匪之縱横。尤足爲奠定川局之障礙。現狀如此。縱有目光遠大之投資家。亦終不能不大費躊躇。可斷言也。</p>
<p>是以欲求大規模投資開發四川一舉之實現。必先使該省政治在短時期内進入常　。而對於省内現有軍隊。尤應有一安挿之辦法。或則令其移駐邊境。或則令其從事屯墾。誠能使純粹消費之軍隊。一變而爲有組織之生產集團。則政治淸明。始有期望。私人投資。亦可源源而來矣。</p>

<h3 id="c105">全國財政會議提案整理地方財政案（部長交議）第整理田賦 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>查我國稅法以田賦爲最古、而積弊亦以田賦爲最深、自十七年田賦劃入地方財政範圍後、正稅之外、附加日多、其繁苛紊亂、更難究詰、本年四中全會通過整理田賦及减輕附加兩案、經奉行政院分别令行辦理、惟田賦情形複雜、各省不同、實施標凖、亟須共同討論、以利推行、</p>
<p>甲·土地陳報之實施土地陳報經四中全會通過原則大綱、並由行政院决議補充辦法、茲特就實施上允宜劃一規定者、发别擬定土地陳報實施章程草案一件、藉供討論、以便廣徵各方意見、并擬訂下列注意各點、（一）舉辦土地陳報一律不征收手續費（二）陳報手續表册應力求簡便陳報後應卽行改訂科則平均負擔、（三）各縣編造正式征册應有劃一規定、（四）陳報後應卽改進推收制度、（五）陳報後應卽改進征收制度、</p>
<p>乙·减輕田賦附加之標準田賦附加之輕重省異而縣不同、甚者竟超過正稅十餘倍之多、其如何切實減免之處、自應各就用途、於審核預算時規定辦法、并於土地陳報後、改訂科則、以謀整個之解决、茲擬訂下列各條、用作出賦未整理就緒以前之限制標凖、（一）田賦附加不得超過正稅總額、其在正稅科則原屬輕微之區、以正附併計、不超過地價百分之一爲限、（二）田賦附加、無論已否超過正稅、自本年度起、省縣均不得以任何急需任何名目、再有增加、（三）各縣區鄉鎭之臨時畝捐攤派、應嚴加禁止、其有因本區鄉鎭之公共利益而按畝出費者、亦應由省厘訂取締規章、嚴加限制、（四）附加帶征期滿、或原標的已不復存在者、應卽予廢除、不得再變更用途、繼續征收</p>
<p>第二改進地方稅制</p>
<p>查自十七年公布國地收支標凖、舉凡向屬中央之契稅牙稅等項、均劃歸地方、二十年中央實行裁厘後、公布營業稅法、復由各省市舉辦營業稅、現地方已有各稅、範圍日有擴展、亟應從事整頓、以裕財源、蓋正稅必先有增加、然後苛雜方易於廢除、茲就地方已有正稅之應加整頓及征收機關之應行統一各端、分述如下、以供討論、</p>
<p>甲·營業稅營業稅自開征以來、時逾兩載、除少數省份稍具成效外、大多障礙叢生、難獲預期之效果、茲據二年來實行之經騐、認爲其征收方法　序有應行改進者數端、（一）調查證應改稅證營業稅法第三條、原有商民請領營業稅調查證之規定、但本條内對於調查證應列欵目、并無明定、各省市征收機關、均係依據商民遵照第三條第一至第四之事項、申請書塡給調查證、而對於營業人應納稅欵等證内、並無載明、且調查證名稱、亦不甚適合、茲擬依照牌照方式、發給營業稅證、不收證費、令商民懸掛、卽以稅證爲征收稅欵之根據、稅證内應規定、載明左列事項、一、營業種類商店名稱、二、營業人姓名籍貫及住所、三、課稅標準及稅率、四、每年應納稅額、五、每期平均應納稅欵數目、前項稅證每年換領一次、不得征收任何費用、（二）稅率分級之限度、各省市現行課稅標凖、均取用資本額與營業額兩種、尚無以純收益額爲標凖者、其課稅稅率所分等級、往往過於繁細、征納兩方、均有不便、茲擬規定以營業額課稅者、其稅率分爲三級、以資本額課稅者、其稅率分爲四級、分級表、另附、（三）行業分類之限度、營業稅之征收、係以行業爲對象、而各省市現分行業種類太多、且不一致、亟應有劃一之規定、以資整理、而稅率高下、與行業之性質攸關、亦更有分别規定標凖之必要、行業分類表及行業分類課稅標凖表、另附、（四）不得對物征收、營業稅應以就業征收爲原則、不當以物品爲征收單位、物品販賣及製造各業之征收、以設有一定之營業塲所及製造塲所者爲限、不應以貨物爲對象、征收類似厘金之營業稅、（五）嚴守征稅之限制、營業稅應征稅率標凖、在營業稅法第四條已有明白規定、第五條對於以營業額不滿一千元資本額不滿五百元、應予免稅之限制、　須切實遵守、使小本營業之商人、得獲稅法保護之實益、</p>
<p>乙·牙稅各省市牙稅之弊、多在課稅標凖之不一、抽收牙佣之無一定限制、征收制度之未臻妥善、依照營業稅法第十條、本有暫照原有稅率改征營業稅之規定、此項牙稅、自應加以整頓、俾漸納於營業稅法定範圍之中、以除苛擾、其應行整理各點如下（一）限定牙行行所、牙行領證營業、不論短期長期、應於縣市鎭集交易地點、設有固定行棧、並不准於交易市集設卡或沿路攔徵收佣、（二）確定牙行責任、牙行爲貨物交易媒介、於售出之貨、對買方應担負完足貨物責任、售進之貨對賣方應担負賠償貨價責任、至貨物未經到埠、不得派遣行夥出埠拉客、及不得强迫直接買賣之客貨、投行納佣、又已經到埠貨物、並不得阻止貨客往投他行、（三）限制牙佣、牙行抽收佣金、各省市頗不一致、約自百分之一至百分之五、際茲農商交困、物價低落、似應予以限制、擬規定一律最多至百分之三、由各省市自行體察當地交易情形、酌定限制之、（四牙行營）業稅、應依交易或買賣額爲標凖、牙行課稅之標凖、有依買賣額或牙佣征收者、各省市亦均不同、因之牙商負担之稅率、恒發生畸重畸輕之弊、以應規定牙行每年或每季應納之營業稅（卽常年稅）按照其介紹之買賣總額規定之、（五）遊行牙紀應廢除、各省市牙行性質不一、亦有露天遊行之牙紀牙夥、雖亦領帖抽佣、並無固定行棧、多屬直接對貨抽收牙佣、違法滋擾、流弊百出、稅欵收入、得不償失、此項牙紀、亟應一律廢除、（六）嚴厲糾正不良征收辦法、各省市不得有變相征收貨物捐之牙稅、牙行之已由商人投標承包、或由官廳委託代征者、均以契約所定之期限爲限、限滿一律廢除、不應再有包徵專征代征等名稱、以除苛擾、</p>
<p>丙·契稅各省市契稅稅率不一、正稅而外、復多附加、遂使匿價漏稅者日多、正稅反受影響、加之推收與稅契、截然兩事、產權移轉、因匿不投稅、遂亦避免推收、糧柱失憑、流弊尤深、茲規定整頓辦法數端如下、（一）契稅稅率暫定賣契稅、不得過百分之六、典契稅不得過百分之三、（二）契稅附加不得超過正稅之半、（三）推收應與契稅同時辦理、一面納稅、卽一面辦理推收、（四）契紙應厘訂劃一式樣、推收過户及應納正賦稅額、均得於契内載明、所有過户印單、可卽廢除、</p>
<p>丁·徵收機關之統一今日地方稅徵收機關、實太複雜、約别之計有四種、（一）專征營業稅之徵收局、（二）征收田賦等省縣稅之各縣縣政府財政局、（三）未設財政局而經徵省縣稅之縣政府財政科、（四）其他廳處征收專欵之局所、（如江蘇敎育經費管理處在各縣招商承辦之（屠宰牙）稅征收處、其他各省、則有委託縣財政局或縣財政科代征者）此四種經征機關、除營業稅局尚有明確專一之責任、能完全對財政廳負責外、其餘則因隷屬之不同、遂致發生推諉侵蝕事　不一之弊、而包商征收者、更不易監督指揮、現欲謀地方財政基礎之確立、應統一地方稅征收機關、舉凡營業稅牙當屠宰等稅及各廳處原征之專欵、均應由財政廳於各縣設置地方稅局、統征收之如必此而後稅制之改進、征收之稽核、征稅人員之訓練、始能有所着手、并可使人民只知納稅機關、僅有一所、亦不致受稅吏之欺朦、統一之辦法如下、（一）各省爲統一地方稅之征收、應於各縣設立一地方稅局、所有營業稅牙稅當稅屠宰稅及其他省縣稅捐、均由該局統征收　解、（二）各縣地方稅局、受財政廳之指揮監督、其組織章程由各省自定之、（三）地方稅局成立後、所有以前之投禁承包委託代征等辦法、一律取銷、　　第三廢除苛捐雜稅</p>
<p>查民國十七年第一次財政會議議定劃分國家地方收支標準案、公布以後、各地方稅政宜可綱舉目張、循軌合轍、乃地方稅捐日益煩苛、呼籲之聲、不絶於耳、揆厥原因、實以改劃伊始、不無罣漏、有僅列稅目、迄未舉辦者（如所得稅之附加、卽係虚列名目之一、）有業已籌辦復經廢止者、（如内地漁業稅已奉明　免予舉辦、）有新闢稅源、辦理稽遲、或辦無成效者、（如營業稅本爲地方大宗收入、遲至二十年裁厘以後、各省市方陸續舉辦、收數亦頗不旺）有應依法改訂稅制、</p>
<p>而迄未改辦或變本加厲者（如各地方牙稅、）在營業稅法中規定係暫照原有稅率改辦營業稅各省市　未改辦、或竟改爲包征代征對物課稅、各省市以支出之日漸澎漲、而收入之基礎未固、故於靑黄不接之時、應事業所需之用、急不暇擇、各爲風氣、自立名目、取財於民、於是苛捐雜稅、紛至沓來、病商擾民、莫此爲甚、茲謀整理地方稅捐、非規定種類範圍、不足以明系統、尤非明定征收程序、不足以昭劃一、茲參酌現行法令、曁各省市現行稅制、規定地方稅捐之種類範圍如下、</p>
<p>（一）土地稅類一、田賦、（包括現行之地丁·漕米·租課·鹽課·漁課·蘆課·等、）二、法定之田賦附加稅、（不超過正稅稅及科則輕微區域、連同正稅一併計算、不超過地價百分之一、）三、依照土地法征收之地價稅等、四、房捐或舖捐、（依照房產或房租價値征收之、）五契稅、六、契稅附加捐、</p>
<p>（二）營業稅類一、依照營業稅法征收之營業稅、二、依照營業稅法應行改辦之牙當屠宰等稅、三、依法應行取締之營業稅、（如車捐船捐廣告捐等、）</p>
<p>（三）行爲取締稅一、直接征收者、（如卜筮星相等、）二、間接征收者、（如酒菜館之筵席捐、如戲館之娛樂捐等、）</p>
<p>（四）公益捐稅類一、對於因改良或修治一切土地水利工程、向受益人民及　車或其他使用者徵收之捐費、（如築路捐、堤工捐、水利捐碼頭捐、倉庫捐港務捐）二、地方政府或自治團體舉辦之公益或衛生事業、經依法定程序向人民征收之捐費、（如衛生捐、路燈捐、）</p>
<p>（五）手續費類一、各級地方政府依法征收之公文書紙價、二、各級地方政府依法征收之契紙價、三、各級地方政府依法政收之行政局法各項罰欵、四、各級地方政府依法征收之查騐費、手續費登記費、</p>
<p>上列地方征收之稅捐、旣經確定範圍則其征收程序、自應詳加規定藉收切實整理之效、而地方政府亦得有所依據、不致發生困難、其征收之程序、應先規定者如下列各點、（一）各省市征收本案列舉規定合法之稅捐、其開始征收時期、遠在民國十七年十一月國府公布國地收支標凖以前者、應將稅捐名稱用途、稅率征收槪數、徵收每月列表專案報部（二）各省市征收本案列舉規定之稅捐、而並未依據現行法律或法令舉辦、其徵收時期在民國十七年十一月國府公布國地收支標凖案以後者、應將稅捐名稱用途稅率徵收槪數徵收年月列表專案報部、轉送立法院補請審議、（三）各省市自民二十三年度起非經立法程序、一律不得徵收本案規定範圍以外之稅捐、（四）各省市非依法律或法令之規定、不得變更原有稅目或稅率、（五）各省市徵收稅捐或增减稅目、凡與法律或法令之規定有抵觸時、財政部得隨時制止撤銷之、（六）各級地方政府得征收手續費類内所列舉之規費、惟須依照現行法律或法令之規定徵收之、並須呈報上級政府或主管部備案、</p>
<p>地方稅捐徵收之範圍及其程序、旣有詳密之决定、則超過法定稅率範圍以外之稅捐、或超過本案規定範圍以外之稅捐、均應視爲苛雜範圍、律廢除、其種類如左、（一）中央各稅之附加稅捐、（二）妨害社會公共利益之稅捐、（三）妨害中央收入來源之稅捐、（四）與現行各稅相同之複稅、（五）妨害交通對物品或舟車通過徵收之稅捐、（六）爲一地方利益、對於地方貨物之輸入爲不公平之課、（七）對於貨物出產或銷塲徵收之稅捐、（八）現行營業稅之附加捐、（九）妨害平民生計之一切稅捐、以上所列、統自民國二十三年七月一日起至二十三年十二月底止、分期一律廢除、未徵者不得藉口任何用途、任何名義、擅自開辦、俾人民痛苦、早日解除、而地方財政基礎、得以確立、國計民生、均攸賴之、</p>
<p>第四案確定地方預案</p>
<p>查整理財政、首在確定預算、上列整理田賦、改進稅政、與廢除苛捐雜稅各事項、復在在與預算有關、各級地方預算究應如何編訂執行、方能使地方財政漸入正軌、以紓民困、問題至爲複雜、茲姑擇其關係較重、需要較切者、酌舉數端、提供討論、</p>
<p>甲、省與縣市地方收支之劃分、省與縣市政府編訂地方預算、自須各就範圍、統籌支配是省與縣市之收支如何、劃淸限界、實有訂定具體標凖之必要、顧各省情形互有異同、此項劃分標凖、似宜由各省政府自行擬訂、送經中央核准施行、但其標凖之擬訂須注意下列各點、（一）關於縣市之收支、當將原屬縣市及其區鄉鎭等者合爲一體、縣市以下不宜再加劃分、使縣市與其區鄉鎭等之財政、歸於統一、（二）關於稅收之劃分、當依稅捐種類分别歸屬、不宜以正稅附稅爲區分、其大宗稅捐、不能完全歸省或歸縣市者、按成數分配之、使省與縣市財政、各得相當穩固之基礎、（三）關於支出之劃分、當以其機關及事業設施目的之所屬爲依歸、使各地人民權利義務、得相當之平均、（四）省與縣市稅收劃分以後、彼此不得附加、以期各自整理、（五）省與縣市支出劃分以後、遇有必要、仍須互相恊助以期平均發展、</p>
<p>乙、訂定辦理縣市地方預算規章之要點、縣市地方預算、如何辦理、在中央現行預算章程内、並無規定、自當由各省訂定單行規章、以資遵守、但所訂辦法、須注意下列各點、（一）縣市政府編審地方預算時務使法團及公民有參加意見之機會、以示財政之公開、其預算之監督、須於行政機關以外别設機關爲之、以防止流弊、豫鄂皖三省剿匪總司令部所頒剿匪區内整理縣地方財政章程、規定設置之財務委員會、具有上項意義、極堪取法、（二）凡屬地方公有之收支不問其來源如何、用途如何、均須編入其預算、以顯示其全部財政狀况、（三）預算科目預求明顯、使一般人民易於通曉、（四）預算編審程序、務求簡便、多用集會查勘方式、以袪除隔閡减少文書承轉、以節省時間、（五）預算公布日期、至遲須在年度開始一個月之前、以便爲實施上之凖備、（六）預算之執行及追加預算、須有嚴格之規定、以杜苛徵濫用之弊、</p>

<p>昨據國際貿易局指導處主任季澤晋氏談華茶在南洋一帶銷路滯塞之原因、及其茶業之危機、言之甚詳、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c146">茶市衰落 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>據談、就星洲一埠言、華人之　　茶業、在疇昔頗爲發達、計大小各茶商商號、無慮四五十家至六七十家之譜、乃近年來以不景氣之關係、竟爾遞减全二三十家而已、茶之來源、率　厦門·福州·温州·等處運來、而大部份係自安溪及武彝山二地所採摘焙製者、其品質佳者、有名色種·奇種·鐵觀音·白毛狐·其次有水仙·烏龍·雪梨·等、查安溪一</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>縣、每年出產茶葉、銷售於潮州十邑·漳州十屬·同安·厦門·南洋·等地、每年約有國幣二百萬元之譜、安溪近來因多土匪之擾、民不聊生、故該地茶葉產量衰落異常、然此於國外貿易、人民生計、大有關係、</p>
<h3 id="c147">台茶傾銷 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>考近年來、馬來亞中國茶葉漸次銷滯、其最大之原因、雖與世界不景氣大有關係、然自台灣茶葉之競爭實爲主要原因、蓋台灣茶葉、現每箱（一百包二十五斤裝）只値二三元四五元叻幣、而國茶自厦門福州温州來者、均須在七元以上、宜台灣茶葉之浸浸乎欲駕國茶以上也、現日金奇賤、在叻雖一箱只賣二三元或四五元、而在台灣卽可獲四五元至七八元以上也、重利商人、見有利可圖、亦自多有棄國茶而取台灣茶以代之者、於是國茶之前途、乃愈不堪聞問、國茶在中國有四季之調和、其採摘茶葉、約在淸明立夏前後、一依氣節、故國產之茶葉、氣味特佳、與其他所產者不同、倘推銷得法、未始無挽回之望、</p>
<h3 id="c148">茶稅苛重 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>國產茶葉滯銷之又一原因、爲馬來聯邦之課收茶稅、一磅須納八占、一箱餉稅、竟有達二元六角餘者、其在荷屬亦然、以前課稅、每箱只四盾八、今竟須六盾至八九盾之譜、此種課稅加重、亦係國產茶葉之致命傷、又際斯不景氣之時、各茶商商店、爲推廣營業、均各設有小車沿街招攬主顧、以期維持營業、亦可見競爭之劇烈矣、</p>
<h3 id="c149">銷數銳减 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>

<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>鄙人近以暫離學校而家居，故於一切學科，均屬自修，致第每有疑難，輒喚奈何！邇復因讀物理學，而發生問題，以致狐疑滿腹。頃閱貴報，得知闢有讀書指導一攔，以備讀者之詢問，不禁大快，茲將急欲求解者，錄之於後：　　凡稍習物理學者，無不熟於伽利略之比薩歪搭實騐，以及牛頓之萬有引力定律。而鄙人之疑問，實以此發生。據伽氏之實騐，則謂凡物體於不受空氣阻止時，自空中在等距離處，同時自由落下，必同時至地，與物體之大小輕重無涉云云。又牛頓氏之定律，則謂凡物相互之引力，與其質量成正比例云云。二哲之言，似不無相背之處。今就鄙見所及，提出數點臚列於後。非敢妄議前賢，實因懷疑未解耳。</p>
<p>一，依伽氏意，以爲物體苟不受任何他物之抵抗或摩擦作用，則落下之速度恒等。以此理解面積與速度之關係則誠對；但就其質量言之，則於牛頓之萬有引力定律之「引力之大小與質量成正比例…」似說不通。　　二，設謂眞空中之物件，與引力無關，故不受地力之影響。果此理屬眞，則眞空中之物，自不能生運動，而當靜止於空間，因能固不能創造也。旣不受任何引力及運動力之作用，則其能自無來源，又何能運動而下落？故此理不能成爲事實。</p>
<p>三，若又謂凡組成物體之分子，係常在運動而非靜止狀態，故物體中早有能之存在，不需供給，平素所以靜而不動者，因受地力之關係，一旦釋其各方之牽制，則潛蓄之能，卽顯運動之現象；然則物體旣不受引力之作用，而由分子之潛力以運動，則其運動之方向，自無一定。何以如伽氏之眞空中之實騐，僅有向下之運動，而决無向上，向左或右各方面之運動？是其所以仍具趨地性者，實爲不脫地力關係之一明證。</p>
<p>總上所說，竊以爲二氏之學說，實相予盾；但後學淺識，莫决其非，旣乏解釋之方，復無供實際研究之具。但爲求知之慾所燃燒，故不揣冒昧，敢勞</p>
<p>淸神畀鄙人以袪疑之劑，則無任感荷矣。</p>
<p>（沅陵瞿起槐來信）</p>
<p>「如果沒有空氣的阻力，質量不同的物體　必以相等的加速度落下。」這個定律，是Ｇａｌｉｌｅｏ發現的，是Ｎｅｗｔｏｎ和Ｂｅｓｓｃｌ證明完全的。我們證明這個定律，正可以應用萬有引力定律，足見這兩個定律並不是互相背謬的。依據萬有引力定律：兩個物體間的引力和這兩個物體的質量之積成正比例，和這兩個物體的距離的平方成反比例。卽：</p>
<p>Ｅ＝Ｇｍｍ—ｒ２Ｃ是引力係數。</p>
<p>現設有三個物體，其質量爲ｍｉｍ２ｍ３。</p>
<p>這三個物體在空中同一地方，離地球有等距離ｒ。又設地球的質量爲Ｍ，則這三個物體與地球間的引力必爲：</p>
<p>ＦＩ＝ＧＭｍＩ—ｒ２Ｆ—２＝Ｇ—Ｍｍ２Ｆ３＝ＧＭｍ３—ｒ２</p>
<p>根據牛頓第二定律：力是質量和加速度之積。卽可推知：</p>
<p>Ｆ（）力</p>
<p>Ａ（加速度）＝——</p>
<p>ｍ（質量）。</p>
<p>則上面三個物體的加速度應爲：</p>
<p>ＡＩ＝ＥＩ—ｍＩＧＭＩ２Ａ２＝Ｆ２ｍ２ＧＭ－　２</p>
<p>Ａ３＝Ｆ３－Ａｍ３＝ＧＭ－ｒ３</p>
<p>卽：ＡＩ＝Ａ２＝３＝Ｇ　Ｉ－ｒ２</p>
<p>由是證明：物體從空中同一地方，同時自由落下，如無空氣或其他阻力，必同時落至地面，與物體的質量無關。</p>
<p>（又一證法）我們旣知：力是質量和加速度之積卽</p>
<p>Ｆ＝ｍａ，</p>
<p>則：ＦＩ＝ｍｉａ。</p>
<p>旣知：ＦＩ＝ＧＭｍＩ－ｒ２</p>
<p>則：ｍＴａ＝ＧＭｍＩ－ｒ２</p>
<p>卽ａ＝ＧＭ－ｒ２</p>
<p>依同法計算Ｆ２及Ｆ３，均得出同樣的結果　　你能了解這些證明，你的第一個疑問就消減了，你的第二第三疑問也就不攻自破了。</p>

<p>伊是絶對不許伊的子民向伊偷看的，所以伊的鸞輿在街上經過的時候，從沒有人敢佇立着觀看的。其實我們大定都知道，那些小百姓們往往在紙窗上挖破了幾個小洞，私下窺看御駕在他們的門前經過：所不知道的，只有太后自已。就是有人告訴伊，伊也不會相信有這些人竟是這樣的膽大。不過伊爲着要求格外的周密起見，在這一乘鸞輿兩邊的窗上，都掛着一種特别的簾子，每一邊的窗上，各掛着兩幅簾子，長短是相同的，不過靠近裏面的一幅，左右共兩幅—因爲正好貼近着伊所坐的地方，所以是用黄緞裏着絲棉做的，不但外面的人望不進來，就是伊自已也望不出去；這樣不是太氣悶了嗎？於是在外面的一幅，（中出是左右共兩幅）便改用透明的輕紗，使伊能够隱隱約約地看到外面的景色，而不爲外面的人所看見。倘若伊還嫌隔着這重輕紗看得太不淸楚，或太吃力的話，伊儘可把身子俯向前去，輕輕地拉開一些紗簾，側着臉張望着。就是這樣，外面的人也不用想窺見伊，卽使眼力最好的脚色，至多也只能窺見伊的幾根手指。（四○）</p>

<p>一碧無際的天空，掛着圓鏡也似的一輪明月，晶瑩朗潤，纎塵無着，髣髴絶代佳人在浴後的一刹那，赤裸裸的一絲不掛，探着首兒憑窗外望；有時，那輕絮般的烟雲，給微微的淸風推送到伊的懷前，把伊籠罩住了，那不過像冰肌玉膚披上蟬翼似的一層輕紗，無損於美，轉足以増其嫵媚，我端的爲伊顚倒，因爲伊太美麗了。在故鄉時，常會獨個兒跑到草坪上，席地而坐，舉頭而望，看伊給濃厚的雲霧掩蓋住了，我京替伊抱屈，看伊活潑地跳出雲層了，我就快活得不可名狀，伊沉思，我也沉思，我和伊已融和於兩靈交感之中，冷風吹蓬了我的頭髮，露水沾濕了我的衣裳，我是不以爲意的；人說我瘋狂，我只一笑置之，因爲這美的，凈化的時境，只可爲知者道，實難與欲人言的。　　當我倦極歸來，作敎我伴着影兒同行；我解衣就寢，伊又偷偷地爬進窗檽，移涉床上，吻我，撫我，直到我睡去爲止，伊那一副圓圓的臉龐，老是泛着慈祥的光輝，我在故鄉時，伊是怎樣，我在客中時，伊又是這樣；如果太陽是象徵着恩威並施的父親，伊便是以純愛涵煦我們的母親。</p>
<p>可是，爝火雖微，衆炎也可以掩大明，在夾着高層建築的馬路上，衖堂裏，伊常給白熱的電光奪去了位置，不是「今夜一輪滿」，早就把伊忘掉了，這是我的不是。</p>

<p>看呀，…大家到「沉香閣」裏，去看燒紙頭房子呀」。弄堂裏大大小小愛凑鬭熱悶的人們，都這樣喊着。　　這大，×宅正在那沉香閣做佛事。男女來賓，倒也不少。再加外面進來看熱鬭的人，一時便擁擠異常。這時就有幾個工役，在院中空地上，放着樹枝稻草之類。上面，再用一張張蘆蓆平舖着。於是把那已經做成的紙房子，從大殿搬進，紛紛勾搭起來。有前進，有後進。除了廳堂廂房之外，有廚房，有汽車間。眞是美輪美奂：内中各種陳設都備，如無綫電收音機等消閒娛樂之品，也應有盡有，各眞的一樣。雖則是座雛形的紙屋，人居然也可以出入。裏面，還堆着不少的冥鏹紙錠，一切享用，好算都已有了。</p>
<p>於是觀衆們，都贊着說：「老太太雖則死了，却眞好福氣，還能住着這樣考究的房子」。也有人嘆着說：「聽說這座紙房子，在冥器店定做的時候，共化去大洋一百幾十元。差不多是「貧户半年糧呢」！」</p>
<p>等到僧衆誦經已畢：就燃起火來，把這紙屋焚化。頓時烈焰飛騰，劈劈拍拍一陣子響。一刹那間，這「望之儼然」的紙屋，便化爲灰燼。</p>

<p>淸末文家，宗定　者綦夥，風會所趨，盛極一時，良以龍文縱横恣肆，有不可方物之妙。時天南遯叟大名震海南，遯叟曾入天平大國，不特爲文奇恣，且明於世界大勢，及戰守謀略，東南士子，咸奉爲祭酒，然其學派，固源出定　也。吾邑鄒酒丐先生，及遯叟門最久，深得其衣鉢珔傳，爲文能鎔當時新舊於五爐，詩詞亦情深意厚，不能以尋常吟風美月之章目之。先生於同光之間，卽以詞章馳譽海内，享文名凡三十年，可謂久矣。民十二間，余偕老友金石壽晤先生於滬西徐家匯之守死樓，余方弱冠而先生已逾古稀，一見如舊相識，縱談達半日，遂訂忘年之交，當時余曾賦詩六章記其事，利於自由談中。先生以游折其足，余暇時恒往晤談焉，厥後先生遷居故鄉后宅，遂不復見，僅間或一通魚雁耳。民十六，余與程小靑，徐碧波諸君，創公園電影院於吳門，先生閱報知其事，馳書爲賀。一日晨，余方高臥未興，週先生自錫游蘇，驅車來訪，僕役以余未起，且見先生衣服不華而跛一足，傲不爲禮，竟拒而勿納，先生乃投刺去，比余起床，僕以刺進，謂頃有跛叟來，告以先生未起，去矣，視刺，赫然先生名也，大　僕人以無禮繼思世固以衣服取人者，設先生衣華貴之服，則僕且足恭肅客人而呼余醒矣。俗有狗眼看人低之諺，世具狗眼者多，况僕乎？責亦奚爲？亟雇街車往訪，時先生寓蕭寺中，相見欣然道故，惟先生已衰態畢露，不復如當年之健碩，爲之惻然久之。又數年而先生死，不圖此匆匆一晤，竟爲最後之一面。先生一代詞家，而身後蕭條殊甚，天與才人者如是可慨也！</p>
<p>宦海現形，莫詳於南亭亭長官塲現形記一書，可謂五光十色，曲寫醜態，蓋在山泉淸，出山便濁，環境使之然也。頻年閱人已多，而秉性老誠，遇人忠厚者，無過疁城吳宗濂先生，先生字挹淸，遜淸卽任職顯要，人民國以後，復歷任國會議員及各國公使，尤嫻法語，爲吾國外交界之老前輩，今黨國要人中，因不乏曾列門牆者也。余識先生時方爲法租界公董局董事，年已七十有零，一見卽知其爲一和藹可親之長者，爾時，先生兼任某輪船公司總理，先生於此道，素屬門外，第爲少數人利用其名别有作用耳。余讅其詳，曾力勸，勿以名譽作無謂之犧牲，厥後先生亦憬悟，毅然絶裾去。惟以生性太忠厚，處處易受人愚，往往一事未了，瞬自之間，又墮入彀中，曾因代人作保，賠累不堪，涉訟甚久，終仍失敗。惟數受宵小播弄，名譽方面，乃頗受損失。歿後，有人謂其求進心急，執一中太甚，至有遭人面斥之事，余獨謂此實環境逼迫使然，蓋當時先生月須五六百金之負担，數年以來，晚境漸逆，收入銳减，舉債度日，不謀出路，實覺困難，衰年尚事奔波，其情亦至可憐，惟綜其一生，忠厚太過，而精悍不足，故外歷宦途，終仍兩袖淸風，鬱鬱不得志而歿。然作官而無錢，居今之世，殊屬難能可貴矣。先生嘗托余介紹入國民黨，不謂中央黨證甫下，而先生已歸道山，現此證尚存余處也。</p>

<p>（中央社馬尼剌特訊）出席十屆遠運會的我國選手團、到馬尼剌已是五天了、犬會昨日亦已開幕、這幾天、國内各報體育欄、必然是滿載着大會的消息、我們的選手情况如何、大會情形如何、比賽經過如何、大家也必十分關心、記者隨軍來菲、早想多寫一些花花絮絮、向大家報告一下、可是時間實在忙不過來、早六七點鐘規定是選手起床的時間、可是六點多鐘、已經是閙哄哄了、要想多睡一回、休想辦到、晚上不到十二點以後、也休想上床、整個的白天晚上忙着訪消息、發電報、連吃飯的時間、幾乎都找不到、可是自已得到參加這樣盛會的機會、倘不向大家報告一些、實在過意不去、於是我祗好忙裏偷閒的寫些不成文的東西、</p>

<p>我們道大中華的美人魚、眞是一條美人魚、當她從香港游上了麥金蘭總統輪時、就掀動了輪上的空氣、你看她光了腿兒、一天換上三四套輕如蟬翼的衣服、東游到西、西游到東、選手們的眼睛、眞是被她游得花了、現在我們道美人魚、又游到菲律賓了、馬尼剌狂熱的空氣、又被她掀動起來、菲律賓女子大學的宿舍裏、每天都擠滿了新聞記者、和僑胞、報紙上每天都登着她不同姿式的照片、無論走到什麽地方、碰到那一國的人、她們談起中國的選手、就要談到美人魚、於是「中國出美人、」「中國出美人魚、」就傳遍了菲島、我們這美人魚眞是一條美人魚、可是我們希望我們這美人魚、不要祗注意在美字上着想、而忘掉她是一條會游的魚、</p>

<p>我們的選手團、除總隊王正廷及其夫人、住在總領事鄺光林家裏、郝更生沈嗣良二代表、住在馬尼剌大旅社外、女選手是住在菲律賓女子大學、男選手住拉柴　大學、都　力　　ＲＩｚａｌ運動塲很近（日本與荷印選手也住在這裏）宿舍就是原來的敎室、議員選手都一樣的、是二三十個人擠滿了一個　　、除了一張小床、一頂小蚊帳外、别無他物、大家都是很快活的過着道單簡的生活、菲律賓的蚊子眞不錯、每天早上我們從疲惓的休眠中醒來的時候總要發現身上起了許多紅　、可是大家疲倦了一天、倒上床上的時候就同死去了一般給蚊子吸去　點血、眞是　不在乎因此到也並不以爲苦、膳食是包給廣東籍的一位華僑廚司的、第　天吃中菜、甜不甜、鹹不鹹酸不酸、辣不辣的幾碟菜、大定雖然餓着肚皮仍有難於下嚥之嘆、第二天改吃西菜、也不過是他那幾樣菜分食罷了、可是我們的經費不足、我們不能同日本一樣的帶了十多位廚司同來、也是沒有辦法、選手們都下了飯廳上祗要裝飽了肚皮、運動塲上都要拚命奮鬥的决心、因此到也平平靜靜、飯廳無戰事、</p>

<p>專爲探訪大會消息而來的各國記者、日本一共來了十六位、我國却祇就是小區一個人、數量上比起來、眞有小巫見大巫之槪、可是有一件事可以告慰大家的、就是小區區並沒有因數量少而丢了國家的臉、初到的一天、才走進宿舍、就給本地華字報西文報的大批同業包圍、第二天的報上、除掉文字的記載外、還在重要篇幅刋載了小區區的照片、這眞使我有點受寵若驚、十號的晚上七點半鐘、馬尼拉的記者公會、在本地最大的也是全世界最大的聖安娜舞塲、歡宴外來記者、本地重要的同業、都親出招待、我除掉凖時赴會外、還約了兼爲申新兩報發電的施肇康周家騏二君、和郝更生代表同往、可是大批的日本同業、都到八時半以後才姗姗而來、在最初的印象上、我們已占了一點不大不小的勝利、宴會中間、賓主免不了互相致詞、主人是由美聯社的Ｍｏｏｒｅ菲律濱自由社的Ｒｏｇｅｔｓ致歡迎詞、我們推郝先生致答詞、滔滔宏論、博得了不少的掌聲、日本的代表站起來、簡單的說了幾句不成體統的話、就坐了下去、宴會是在幾幕特别跳舞表演後完結、大批的日本記者、就這樣無聲無嗅無始無終的走了、我們周旋了一番、方才告别、在這幕莊嚴隆重的同業歡宴席上、我們總算未辱使命、爲國家爭了一點小小的體面、</p>

<p>日菲兩國之非法解散遠東體育恊會、另行組織所謂東亞業餘體育恊會者、已於昨日詳言之矣、日本恃其政治外交的威脅、使菲律賓代表接受另一背景之命、不得不爲之屈伏、於是向來任人宰割之我國、亦不得不以國家原氣之頽唐而影響到今日體育外交之失敗、然而菲律賓代表態度之所以突變、尤有不能不加以伸述者、</p>
<p>夫菲律賓籌備本屆速運大會、爲期一年之外、如新建列柴　運動塲等、所費達百餘萬元、當此經濟恐慌之秋、除一方面極力設法弭補外、更不得不仗門票之收入、以資挹注、但日本自提出要示僞組織參加後、在滬召集之三國圓桌會議時、因中日兩方各執其詞、雄辯不休、菲代表之所以嚴守中立、不絲毫發表其意見者、惟恐予任何一國有不利、致使大會前途發生障礙、而不能如期舉行、遭受經濟上之重大損失耳、故復極力在中日之間、搖尾乞憐、綏和空氣、以冀顧全菲律賓之立塲、及耗費鉅資經營第十屆大會之苦心、使大會得以如期舉行、遂提議將此問題提交在大會舉行時之定期執委大會中討論、圓桌會議暫作如是之結束、我國乃墮其圈之中、</p>

<h3 id="c243">小題大做 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 公羽</p>
<p>大題是難做的，也懶得做，祇得做小題；小題的結局不會大的，又憧憬於大，祗得小題大做。</p>
<p>八股文試士，那精義是在經書中割截出若干小塊，呌士子將文義聯貫起來，成爲一種大文；介浩浩蕩蕩的大文，任才使氣的作者，皆在黜斥之列的，不但寫者費力，看者勞神，而且人人談「今夫天下：：：」，那麽天下豈不會漸漸被談的不穩固了麽？原來束縛人心，禁制思想，古人早就有了妙法的。</p>
<p>然而一到不以文章取士了，情形何嘗會兩樣呢？最好是不談，也不要思想，大家悠閒。必欲說話呢？租界有西牢，巡捕有皮鞭，野有委蛇，澤有徬徨，郵信有扣留，報館有油墨：：：怎麽欄呢？依然要說話，則止許說」悠閒」，「雅逸」，「委婉」，「曲折」：：：的話，不許說「今夫天下」那種話…　　那麽，「天下」便無可說話之人了麽？在現代，似乎還不少．錦心繡口的才人，波瀾老成的文士，旣美過於鸚鵡，又巧過於獮猴。說，依然振振有辭，有方法，也依然是「小題大做」。</p>
<p>例如「事出有因，查無實據」，這種不着邊際的妙說，固然好像非常合理，然那方面早已坑去了是非。是非之情一失，則可說之話多矣，於是金聖歎之頭，和野人頭一同出賣：袁中郎，Ｘ中郎之鬼又出現於人間。何况逍遙齊物，實有空無，弄來弄去，要使自已對於一切者迷離　徜了。幸而當今文士，古氣不深，不然，是可以捧出若干陸離光怪的古董，來炫戁今人的耳目的。</p>
<p>但讀者時常對於小題不滿，所以那方面又祗得大做。我們祗見「幽默」，「俗字」，「西裝不好論」：：；在耳際喤喤，其實皆是小題，氣力可也眞白費了。</p>
<h3 id="c244">平綏綫上 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>坐平綏車是不舒服的。震盪之外，車走得也慢。</p>
<p>北平一些拉駱駝載重的　，常常使那雙峯動物成串地在鐵軌綫上進行，長𩓐子下面的銅鈐噹浪噹浪嚮着，火車來了，不慌不忙地走開去。據說，那銅鈴鐺的用處是在驚狼。</p>
<p>除了正太路之外，恐怕這一條路是比較多山而惡險的吧。山是北方式，禿禿的全裸着，大石塊參差伸張，是枯乾上塗抹着黧黑和薑黄。四月天氣還不見地皮靑。</p>
<p>車不敢走快了。有一段是因爲枕木已腐朽，走快了怕出軌；有一段是車與山勢成直角的上升，怕中途滑下；有一段是因爲載客頗多，怕脫鈎。某一時期還有些煤水不濟的怪現象，可惜我未親眼看到。</p>
<p>這列車上，武裝同志總是那麽特别多。多而不和氣。</p>
<p>第一名是淸華園，第五站是南口…這類有名的地方，我不必人云亦云地費筆墨。簡單說，見到果樹較多時便近平地了。到康莊，以下便是平且眞個「康」了。到「懷來」可以遙望果樹林一片。</p>
<p>江南的路畔是靑且綠，淸新而有朝氣，縱然是破弊，但終見出奮發，但塞北，是灰黯，是枯乾，到處是失掉了靈魂的體骨，到處是露骨的飢寒，不蔽風雨的屋，餓孩子，大眼睛，瘦的臉。</p>
<p>到大同，特别看見了窮因，大地上滿是土砂，有些人家的生活賴着「性」的交易。</p>
<p>大同一帶差不多天天刮黄風，砂石蔽天，弄得饅頭也牙滲了。水也是黄濁。砂土地裏只有一欄產品；山藥蛋（卽馬鈴薯），這是大部人們的菜又是飯，吃得嘴裏發酸。倘使有一天，沙漠南移到大同，恐怕連山藥蛋也不會再出產。</p>
<p>爲了生活賣「性」又豈是願意呢？這裏有秀麗的顏色和瘦小的脚。「人下人」的境遇中又是多少血涙呵！</p>
<p>暑天時，也許可以見到筱麥田，麥穗兒如飛燕蹁躚。用這做成的面餅，外省人不習慣吃，因爲是極滑腸的。</p>
<p>車停止在包頭，再西向便　沒鐵軌了。</p>
<p>包頭市上還是有古風的。帝國主義的煤油雖然暢銷，但人們睡覺還是很早。</p>
<p>有一天，我坐在一個高樓上吃茶，見樓下街心中，一位衣冠中人，用手拾起路上的新鮮馬糞，放在懷裏。</p>
<p>馬糞乾可作柴燒，沒有氣味。蒙古包裏的唯一燃料便是它。</p>
<p>有人和我講到蒙古包去。你騎在馬上不下來，喊一聲，主人如歡迎，便有女人來請你下馬，進去，到一定的客位上，坐臥都由你，吃的時候一起吃，不必道謝，不必給錢，走的時候最好不告而去，他們也不追…</p>
<p>我還不大會騎馬，止於包頭，沒再西去。</p>

<p>— 高平</p>
<p>粉讀文學三五兩月的專號後</p>
<p>「文學」在這半年中，於三月間出了一個「弱小民族文學專號」</p>
<p>近來鄙薄翻譯的名流，多半是自已通外國文，會看「原本的，但所通的或是英文，或是法文，或是德文俄文，懂得匈牙利文猶太文和波蘭文的，恐怕很少罷？假使沒有英，德，法文的譯本，那麽我們的名流，也何從接觸弱小民族的文學？」</p>
<p>「原本主義」在中學和大學，不知貽誤了多少的學生，在文藝上，又不知嚇倒了多少的讀者！</p>
<p>我們的讀者並不都通外國文，卽使學過，也只一二種，然而他們有接觸世界文學的必要，於强國文學之外，也有接觸弱小民族文學之必要。稍有心肝的人，就不能不承認我們本國的創作是還不及外國的作品的，「他山之石」，總應該歡迎。假如不然，我國的創作竟己好過外國的了，可是我們仍然應該讀外國作品的，卽使單是爲了使自己的眼界廣大，趣味豐富。旣然要讀外國作品，則翻譯這工作就廢不了，恰如在男女尚無直接的社交不能自由變愛的時代，媒婆總是不可少的，如果想結婚。</p>
<p>也有自已是創作家而看不起翻譯的，這是恐怕讀者一注重翻譯就不免「長他人志氣滅自家威風」之故。這還可以拉扯了國貨與洋貨的事例作證。然而國貨之所以不能抵抗洋貨，豈不是因爲國貨不能仿傚洋貨的製造方法之故麽？國貨年的要着，其實，應該是督促廠家，參考洋貨的製法，生產出同樣精美的品物來。否則，摩登仕女到底喜用舶來品的。經濟上抵抗不住洋貨的輸入，在文藝上，對於外國作品的閉關政策，却大大地奏了效，這是怎樣一回事啊！</p>
<p>在翻譯上頗盡了力的魯迅，在一篇短文中，曾有這樣的話：「遙想漢人多少閎放，新來的動植物，卽毫不拘忌，來充裝飾的花紋。唐人也還不算弱，例如漢人的墓前石獸，多是羊，虎，天祿，辟邪，而長安的昭陸上，却刻着帶箭的駿馬，還有一匹駝鳥，則辦法簡直前無古人。現今在墳墓上不待言卽平常的繪畫，又有人敢用一朶洋花一隻洋鳥，卽私人的印章，可有人肯用一個草書一個俗字麽？許多雅人，連記年也必是甲子，拍用民國紀兀。不知道是沒如此大膽的藝術家；還是雖有而民衆都加迫害，他於是只得萎縮，死掉了？</p>
<p>「宋的文藝，現在似的國粹氣味就薰人。然而遼，金，元陸續進來了，這消息很耐尋味。漢唐雖然也有邊患，但魄力究竟雄大，人民具有不至於爲異族奴隷的自信心，或者竟毫未想到，凡取用外來事物的時候，就如將彼俘來一欄，自由驅使，絶不介懷。一到衰敝陵夷之際，神經可就衰弱過敏了，每遇外國東西，便學得彷彿彼來俘我一樣，推拒，惶恐，退縮，逃避，抖成一團，又必想一篇道理來掩飾，而國粹遂成爲孱王和孱奴的寳貝。」</p>
<p>這話雖然本不是論翻譯的，但是可以移贈　部分看不起翻譯的人。一定說翻譯不容易好的人，也犯了把外國東西過於可怕的毛病。魯迅在那篇短文中，還說起楊光先反對湯若望的事，「寗可使中夏無好曆法，不可使中夏有西洋人」，現在的有些反對翻譯者，其實也有着這種心理的。</p>
<p>在讀者方面，也有因爲現在的譯文往往不很流暢，看起來不「爽快」，所以厭棄翻譯的。其實所謂流暢，本有種種的程度。林琴南的譯文，是被一般人們認爲流暢的，但是我們且不說他的不「信」，只問對於文言文沒有較深的修養的人們，能够「爽快」地讀林譯的說部麽？同樣，說現在的譯文不爽快的人們，其實，也是對於現代的語體文的文法和結構不甚了然之故，别的人們就並不以爲不爽快。而且一味要求流暢，也不是讀者的正當的態度，我們讀中國的古書的時候，不也常常遇到不流暢的地方麽？然而，我不曾聽見人們因此否定古書的價値。還有許多文豪們，在摹仿古書的深奥，故意要使人看不懂，自以爲能呢！</p>
<p>在翻譯工作被阻遏得幾乎全然停頓的今日，「文學」出了兩個翻譯專號，實在是一件很痛快的事。最有力的，是這兩個專號中，所提供的良好的譯文，對於「呌誰譯？」這個問題，這兩個專號便以鐵證答覆着。讀了三月的「翻譯專號」中的伊凡的不幸，二十六個和一個，改變，山中笛韻和五月的「弱小民族文學專號」中的獄中，在公安局，桃園，催命太歲諸篇之後，我們就可以斷然的說，周筧，陳節，芬君，張祿如，丙甲，連鎖，餘聲幾位譯者，是最堪負翻譯之責的。他們的譯文，簡直和創作一樣，並且在内容上也使我們相信是可信的，因爲是尋不出破綻來。尤其値得注意的，是這幾位譯者的名字都是我們未嘗見過的，也許其中不無「文壇老將」的化名，但新的翻譯者，也一定是有着的，這事情也够使我們十分掀喜。</p>
<p>我相信「文學」的這兩期專號，對於中國的文壇，不會沒有影響的。至少，這使讀者相信中國有着上述的極好的翻譯者，而且别的許多譯文，也都能給人以很好的印象。中國的讀者，必將因此重視翻譯，而促進翻譯的工作，而與世界文學多所接觸的罷？</p>
<p>不過，對於「譯什麽？」這問題，文學是還不曾具體地答覆的。我希望「文學」對於這，不但能早日答覆，而且能早日實行。譬如，許多世界的不朽的巨著，無人譯，或譯了無書店肯印的，文學不妨託人譯出連載，就是一年只能連載一部也好。</p>

<p>— 高碧</p>
<p>—爲故友陳行叔逝世三周紀念作—</p>
<p>（六）行叔的天性非常發達，不幸他一生下來就失去了他慈愛的母親，這在他引爲畢世難忘的缺憾。他雖有着好多的兄弟和姊妹，洋溢着彼此的呴濡，仍然不能减少他孺慕的惆悵。我也早就喪了母親的，平日行動，難免有一些悽凉的流露，就在這一點上引起他的共鳴，對於我，格外顯示着親熱與諒解了。實際我的氣質根本與他不同：我木訥而剛强，他委婉而温柔；我一味任性，他百般容忍；我禁不得感情的激動，往往造成言詞的過失，他能以理智調節感情，使之有適度的發展。兩人對比之下，該是難以調和的了；可是，我自己雖然木强任性，却極希望别人能够給我一些善意的熨貼，而最能慰藉我的便是行叔；同時我也見得行叔雖然時時顧到理性，實在他一身滿貯着豐富的感情，當情理兩者在内心衝突得厲害的時候，定會使他感到痛苦與煩惱，我將這層觀察所得的向他啓示，他完全認爲知言。我們的友誼就在這樣相互諒解之下而堅凝了。</p>
<p>我對於行叔的廣泛交際，以及他面面俱到的手腕，也曾起過一度强烈的反感。我確曾加以嚴厲的批判，甚至公然指斥他是懷着不誠實的心思，而且具有可怕的「手段」的—這自然是一種有意的督過，一種含有挑戰性的壓迫。他在這樣嚴重譏彈之下，總是顯着萬分寃屈的樣子，用他特有的委婉語調，來申釋他的立塲—現在想起來我是多麽的殘忍啊—最後他還巧妙地說：「卽使我是善用「手段」的人，也不至於將「手段」施用到你的身上來。」這名話我是非常滿意地接受了。</p>
<p>記得有一次，他若有所思地默坐着，我和仲持踱過去，他忽然向我說：「假使可能的話，你對於社會一般人給你的觀感，有着甚麽的希求呢？」我坦率地道：「我希望任何人都能敬憚我。如此而已。你呢？」我反問他。他微笑着說：「我也同你一樣，只是將「敬憚」二字改作「親愛」罷了。」那時仲持在旁直覺地說：「這是你們意念的不同點；也就是你們行徑的分野綫。」</p>
<p>現在有一節應該使我故友知道的，就是：從前他常常勸我　抑感情的金玉良言，我當時雖也有接受的意思，總還以爲是一種「人情世故」上的訓練，而無關於立身的宏旨的，現在纔明白這是我的極大誤解。一個人不在理智上下一番分析工夫，而只是逕行直遂，籠統發揮，結果非陷於愚昧，卽入於蒙蔽；這明明是意識的不健全，換言之，也就是人生的大缺失。我一想到過去許多可詛咒的任情行爲，眞是羞慚無地，而惜乎今日之轉移，已不能得到行叔的贊許了。</p>

<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>阿根擎了燒餅回店，座上已來了許多茶客。</p>
<p>不必一一介紹，都是風雨不更的那幾隻熟面孔。這五家鎭稍可露露臉的人是都在這裏聚全了。</p>
<p>如其不是出什麽猛將會之類的把戲，福興茶園裏是不會有陌生面孔發見的；一個難得踏進茶園的人想到這裏來歇脚，第一得大爺二爺…的侍餱那輩自以爲爺類的長衫同志—五家鎭上穿長衫的都是有身份的人—而且他們的眼睛都打着問號在你臉上旋轉，哼！你也可以到茶可以到茶園裏來聊大嗎？</p>
<p>說到阿根，自然送茶送水忙得他脚底老在汚泥老在汚泥上打淌，而且他心中記掛着兩塊大洋的損失，他傻念着那是笑話，朱大爺沒有死，門外，不是？嗨，朱大官，那，朱大爺一定沟有死</p>
<p>「朱大官，朱大爺沒有來？」阿根被兩塊錢想獃了喊了出來。</p>
<p>朱大官滿頭是汗，身體像秋千般沒處安放，對了那末多的父執也沒有叔叔伯伯的呌一陣，</p>
<p>擘開了迎上來的阿根，沒頭沒腦的問；</p>
<p>「你們看見他嗎？」</p>
<p>徐大爺倒底是五家鎭上坐第一把交椅的，他出的主意，不，他的命令誰最哼一個不字，眞是要吃不了兜着走哩。不過，這五家鎭上誰都可以死，朱小全郤天不能沒有眼睛，徐大爺幾乎忘了吃燒餅，就在盤算這件事的命令。朱二官那傢伙不是好惹的，他不懂得父執是什麽東西，更不懂得坐第一把交椅者的威權，他講拳頭，打出人命來可以開碼頭，抓信了他也能說過二十年又是一條好漢。徐大爺最怕的就是好漢，因爲好漢的兩個拳頭並不像阿根似的常常打在自已屁股上來。徐大爺許多年每天吃三個燒餅，郤沒有吃過拳頭；不過他是五家鎭坐第一把交椅的，拳頭迎面飛來，也得把自已的面頰往前去凑一凑，所以阿根爲了朱小全的死損失兩塊錢，無論如何不及徐大爺的擔心之萬一。朱大官來了，「你們看見他嗎？」似乎「他」的拳頭，就在徐大爺的面前幌動，但是坐第一把交椅的徐大爺不能不發命令。</p>

<h3 id="c267">對於我國遠東運動會選手進一言 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 家聲</p>
<p>第十屆遠東運動會於昨日（五月二十日）宣告閉幕。我國除保持足球錦標，及在田賽中陳寳球得鉛球第二，和符寳盧得撑竿跳第二稍有面子外，其他球類，田徑賽，游泳等錦標，都歸日菲榮獲。我國成績之不能迎頭趕上，比美遠東，槪可想見！茲悉我國選手團將於後日（二十三日）乘傑克遜輪船返國，我十二萬分的願意，把我赤裸裸的心，在選手團前展露，希望選手團對於我這篇小小文字，留意一下。</p>
<p>我國成績所以不及日菲的緣故，歸納起來有二點：</p>
<p>（一）關於先天的：</p>
<p>記得去年某先生到我們校裏來講演，他說：「第三屆全國運動會在杭州舉行的結果，劉長春與孫桂雲大出風頭，全國景仰，但是我考察他倆所以對於賽跑有特殊成績的緣故，發現他倆的祖先在日時，每天總要跑幾十里路，就是從他家裏到客地去經商，他們的祖先，有跑路的本能藴蓄在細胞中，把這種本能，流傳到後代，他們的子孫，當然是賽跑的名將無疑！」我們對於某先生這番話，雖然不能完全信托，但至少先天本能的發展，有相當存在的價値，我們只要在馬路上觀察西洋人和中國人的一盤體格，就可以知道遺傳的不虚了。</p>
<p>由此類推，我國成績的落後，先天遺傳的不足，是無可否認的：補救唯一的辦法，只有鍜鍊我們的體格，日進康健之境，希望我們的下一代，體格康健起來，再與異邦爭覇。日本體質的改進，是前車之鑒。</p>
<p>日本菲列賓選手的先天比較强；我國選手的先天比較弱，以致成績落後，這是我們可以原諒的。</p>
<p>（二）關於後天的：</p>
<p>凡是一事件的成就，决不是偶然的，非有長久時間的訓練，和精神的修養不可，現在分别討論如下：</p>
<p>（甲）長久時間的訓練：</p>
<p>這大槪是我國運動員的通病罷！凡是對於體育已經稍露頭角的人，在平時不去練習，逢到萬國運動會，遠東運動會，分區運動會，江大運動會，學校運動會，團體對抗之前的幾個星期，才開始練習，經過長時間的停止，忽然劇烈的練習，他們的成績能否進步？卽使進步，他的速率决沒有平時長時間的練習進步快。所以我希望今後的選手們，要有長時間的練習，萬萬不可臨時的抱佛脚。</p>
<p>（乙）精神的修養</p>
<p>沒有精神上的修養，體格决不能康健，成績更談不到！我們說名良心話，中國的運動員，對於精神修養，實在太缺乏了。跳舞塲，影戲院，咖啡店…，…都滿佈着他們的踪跡，追求異性，更是他們的願望，這樣的毁壞身體，浪費精力，成績安得不落後，這一方面我們不能否認是社會環境使然，但是他們意志的薄弱，亦誰敢否認呢？我希望今後的選手們，痛改前非，注重精神的修養：這非但在在績上能猛進不已，於吾人的壽命上，也得延長些吧！</p>
<p>至於其他如：選手間意見的衝突，選擇標凖的不正確，選手散居各地，缺乏聯絡等等，是次要的緣故，只得不提。</p>
<p>總结起來：關於先天方面，雖不及日本，菲律賓，以及其他一切强種的國家，但倘若對於後天方面，能充分的修養和節制，我們的成績，也决不怎樣落後的。我希望在第十一屆的遠東運動會塲上，目睹我選手們吐眉揚氣，打倒異族，奪知錦標歸來，替祖國爭一口氣，那是作者所馨午禱祝的。</p>
<h3 id="c268">關於學生吸烟問題 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>前天報紙上敎育新聞裏有一條說：「敎育部通令各省市學校，嚴禁學生吸烟」。不標使我感慨繫之！</p>
<p>近年來，烟捲成爲一種極流行普遍的消耗品了。大部分靑年都會吸烟。有些人竟以爲不會吸烟就非摩登人物。所以往往有些不會抽烟的人也夾起一支烟捲呑雲吐霧似的玩着。在學校裏這些現象是極普遍的。</p>
<p>不但如此，而且吸起烟來非洋貨不足以示闊。在吸烟的學生底目光裏，國貨裏最優等的烟捲，無論如何比不上最劣等的洋貨。換一句話說，寗可把錢送到外洋去。</p>
<p>這裏現象是多可怕啊！這樣下去，一方面學生的心理日趨惡劣，一方面經濟的漏巵更大。結果有不堪設想者！</p>
<p>在這一點上論，嚴禁學生吸烟不愧爲一種仁政！</p>
<p>然而，懷疑跟着來了！無論那個學校的章程上都有不准吸烟的規則，同時沒一個學校裏沒有吸烟的學生！這些矛盾的現象又是如何產生的呢？更在消極一方面說：在社會上會吸烟的人物未始都不是從學校裏出來的。卽使在學校裏不抽烟，到了社會上之後也會吸起烟來的！難道說一脫難學生生活之後馬上可以吸烟？</p>
<p>如果說在學生的年齡是不能吸烟的，回爲對於身體有害。但是，我們知道砒霜可以毒死老年人同時也可以毒死靑年人的。爲什麽對於學生的身體地樣掛懷，而對於學生以外的人們那麽輕視？</p>
<p>話似乎太歪一些，意思也未免「丢曲」。不過，禁止學生吸烟是否一個通令就可見效的？我可以武斷地說一名！</p>
<p>任何通令總敵不過旅惑的力量！</p>
<p>在新生活運動的呼聲之下，這些通會的產生是必然的事。不過我要求敎育當局注意到别一點去！一天到晚上跳舞塲，影戲院，大菜館，摟着女人的學生正充滿在各學校裏。我不敢相信這些行爲會比吸烟理高上一些的。</p>
<p>我不提倡吸烟—雖然我自己吸烟—我也不反對出通令嚴禁學生吸烟。不過我希望；</p>
<p>（一）注意到比吸烟更壞的學生行爲。</p>
<p>（二）改良學生界的環境；减少不良的引誘。</p>

<p>— 櫻櫻</p>
<p>寫字桌前，安設着那隻大的玻璃高脚缸。儲養了好多條小的金魚。</p>
<p>從缸的外邊，透進到里面那幾條水棲動物，都是那般的細小，靈活！</p>
<p>攢着，從同伴間的肩膀邊攢過來，又從另外那個同伴的尾巴跟游了過去！</p>
<p>一息都不肯停歇；像是個小小的游</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>泳專家，有着極堅持的長力！</p>
<p>綠油油的細草，襯托了一雙同樣金黄顏色的；又同樣那樣嬌小的金魚，並游着！怪親熱得像一對小情侶。</p>
<p>有一條全身都是那麽的烏黑！祗當中小肚子邊，有一層如白色，比較最長成些，全隊裏一個老大哥。</p>
<p>還有條金紅色，有着一條蝴蝶姑娘肢膀形的尾巴！</p>
<p>四個可愛的小同伴，整天不做什麽　大家爭着學習游泳，希望一個好的志向，能實行做一個游泳家。</p>
<p>雪弟弟放學回來。第一抛去了書包，先看一看他的小朋友們可安全，可活潑？把母親分給他自已吃的小餅子，也分些給它們吃。</p>
<p>他說，不吃東西，不會游！不會游了，就不再好玩。</p>
<p>天眞的小心靈，根本不懂得怎麽喚着死？他祇知道不動啦，總不再會使感　興趣！</p>
<p>每次定要自己看過了，才算放懷！於是再温書，寫字。</p>
<p>但是不幸的事實，總會有一天眞的來臨了！</p>
<p>一般和平時一樣，他從校裏回家來。大氣量的把姊妹給他的小麵包，散些進了那個玻璃缸中！</p>
<p>突然的，他哭起來啦。</p>
<p>「怎麽啦，雪雪」？媽問着他。</p>
<p>「不好啦，媽媽，小金魚不動了—甜的麵包片，也不要吃」。</p>
<p>不知什麽時候幾條小生命這麽的死去啦！</p>
<p>「雪雪，小金魚都死去哩！自然它不來吃你的甜麵包啦」。</p>
<p>「怎麽死了？我要它不要死，讓它吃我給它的甜麵包」！</p>
<p>「死了，怎麽會活！明天再買幾條，你把甜麵包藏好了。這幾條讓花花伴夜飯吃吧」。</p>
<p>「那麽的呑進去嗎？啊，不許的。花花不罪過」？</p>
<p>急忙的他抽開了一只盛香烟的壳子。把死去的幾條金魚，輕輕地都划進到盒子里。涙汪汪的，眼睛哭得像死去的小金魚突出的眼睛一樣腫得可憐！孩子的心才最仁慈—他替那些可憐的小生命安葬了！</p>
<h3 id="c270">中國婦女底具體前途 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 秀英女士</p>
<p>頃閱十九日本刋中國婦女的前途一文後，深深引起個人對於作者波兒君發生相當同情，並認爲該文言論比起一般空喊婦女運動及一切亂出風頭的主張，高明而且正確得多。現在個人也不揣冐昧，試草一點意見；倘能與前文相接應，則個人貢獻於婦女同志之愚見，有如次之三點：</p>
<p>第一，客觀的事實早已說明了，所謂「婦女參政運動」及「自由戀愛」都是過去的口號。誠然，在打倒舊的束縛習慣制度時，婦女是需要那樣的解放。可是，現今許多有閒階級之浮薄靑年男女，已經把「自由戀愛」變成四馬路上野雞式的「唯財是愛」主義；同時，「參政運動」之意義，已經變成「妻以夫貴」之特殊階級的活動現象：：：：。凡此一切，豈不充分的警告了我們，所謂「現在的婦女運動是應該改換口號了」嗎？而且接着下來的婦女運動，不能不採取更進一步的方針。所以，我們認爲：婦女平等戀愛的基礎，要在生產勞動過程中建立生活；婦女政治主權要在推翻剥削階級及一切視女性爲附屬或裝飾品的奮鬥過程中創造自已底地位。唯有這樣，才是婦女爭取自由平等之出路！</p>
<p>第二，關於體力與腦力，自然是因歷史上一貫之束縛，使婦女缺少發展之機會。但是，現在我們應該在實際操作習慣中，鍜鍊出來。在加一方面，要堅决地反對那種有閒階級之閒情無聊的什麽「提倡婦女敎育」或風頭式的「婦女健康」等等蔑視，婦女玩弄婦女的口號。因爲，事實告訴我們，現在一般敎育和體育傾向，至少在中國這一封建束縛及帝國主義壓迫之下，毫無疑義，是一種裝飾統治階級的外衣，乃至於愚弄大衆的麻醉劑。我們曾經看見，無數的大中學校畢業的女生，旣不能替社會辦事，又不能料理日常家庭生活，甚而至於連自已生活必需的操作都辦不了——然則，這究意是她們腦筋受了專制約束呢？還是體質完全都不健康呢？天曉得！她們是祗有把體力培植去專們令異性肉感方面努力；同時，又把腦力用到迎合情人之手淫式或買賣式的功夫方面去消耗了。所以，爲了尊重女權，婦女現在應該在認識社會與充實知識方面去鍜鍊腦力！應該在操作技能方面（由工廠乃至於廚房都應該一樣的要用心啊！）鍜鍊體力！唯有這樣，才可以表現出婦女之眞正的美德</p>
<p>第三，根據以上第一點所述之「客觀環境中建立婦女奮鬥之標凖，」及第三點所述之「主觀質量上建立婦女堅固的力量」；最後，應該把婦女運動當如戰爭一樣，在策略上，要把一切有閒階級壓迫或蹂躪婦女（不僅是男子拳足打人，至於以勢利誘迫婦女結婚，或强姦等情，亦屬於壓迫和蹂躪）者及其制度，當做敵人。把一切爲社會大衆福利而勞動（不分精神或體力）者及其所切望的止標，當做友軍，這樣方可完成婦女運動底任務。這是極其鮮明的大道，正如世界婦女運動之策略，在弱小民族的中國應該打倒列强而聯合一切弱小民族一欄，是一種鬥爭的陣勢呵！</p>
<p>總結起來：婦女前途已經走到社會運動之尖端。解放的奮鬥，亦正如現今實際生產力需要一種適合於它自身之發展的新生產制度一樣的迫切了。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>洪亮而悠長地一聲汽笛，緊迫，催促，驅逐着人們。一個個便開始亂滾，像潮水似的，各處奔流，狽狼地洶湧地。</p>
<p>輪船漸漸開始移動了，屁股後的浪花，打着無數的白旋，滾，濺，一團團的水花，滿天笙衝。</p>
<p>嗚地最後一聲兒，輪船終於離開碼頭了，我與Ｈ地六個月的生活，從此作别了。</p>
<p>個人的旅程，我感學是椿苦悶不過的事。有誰願意把悶氣放在肝裏呢。</p>
<p>無聊地我站在甲板上，瞧着那靑蒼的天，無崖的海岸，浴着日光，濺着海水，被淸凉的海風掃過的臉上，頓時我感覺種無限輕鬆的愉快。</p>
<p>可是不外之後，一種崇高的隱憂，仍舊深深地蟄伏在我的心底深處。生活的路程長跑不盡的，我的前途可不是像汪洋這般茫茫嗎？</p>
<p>爲了敎育，爲了生活的鐵索所鞭韃　　—許我這麽擔白地說罷—我是必須到處飄泊着…</p>
<p>此刻，我感覺空虚，生疎，寂寞，矛盾，……大地老是凌亂地汚濁地絶無生氣似的。對於家庭我是陌生了，對於社會我也是陌生了。我覺得自已是孤另另地在這冷森森的社會裏活着，我沒有感到熱情，親切，可以合作的情緒。</p>
<p>負了創痛底歷史的重擔，我艱難因苦地蹌踉着，路是越走越遠呢。</p>
<p>哀傷地我嘘了口氣，抖了下身子，揩揩臉上被海水濺着的小珠。</p>
<p>這時，站在我旁邊的一位新從美國轉來向我自動介紹他自已的法學博士拍拍我的肩膀說；</p>
<p>「密絲脫，你不是很寂寞嗎？全中國都是寂寞的，糟糕，我也很恨懊悔自已回到一塌湖塗的中國來啦，」</p>
<p>「怎麽呢？」我冷悄悄地反問他名。他眼睛一睜，說；</p>
<p>「中國不成不成，你瞧：骯髒，凌亂，腐敗，卑鄙，野蠻，····簡直不配稱謂文明國啊！密絲脫，美國便不同了，他們是富於創造性，活生生的，什麽東西有軌道，難怪他們是國富民强，……我敢大胆說，美國是個天堂，中國是個地獄。密絲脫，你會相信我這話嗎？……</p>
<p>「我不願意聽你先生那麽定斷……」</p>
<p>「那末，你覺得我這話就不對嗎？</p>
<p>老實對你說，密絲脫，中國想强，只好跟着美國跑，我以爲我們必須和美國合作，不然中國永遠沒有希望了，」</p>
<p>我冷冷給他一眼，心裏忍不住在暗笑，我想這是洋博士，大學敎授，擔當着國家最高文化的指導者之一，狗屁不通，中國不是受了他們這類人的毒的嗎　　於是我率直地對他說；</p>
<p>「博焉，你怎的也變不了是個中國人，那幅黄面孔，老洗不脫呢？我十二分的睜望你，睜大了眼睛，冷靜地研究下眞正的中國，眞正的世界的情形，再來定斷，再來討論，然而，千萬不要忘掉你也是個中國人啊！」</p>
<p>他由鼻裏哼了聲，氣冲冲地向我說　　「你不懂！你不懂！你沒有禮貌！」於是急急地跑開了。</p>
<p>𠷺𠷺！汽笛呌了兩聲，我也跑進房去了。心裏仍舊寂寞的，但有幾分好笑呢。</p>
<h3 id="c273">遊記隨筆之類 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>續幽默之後，遊記隨筆之類，似乎又進而估着文壇的上風了。我們隨手翻美一本報章雜誌看看，這類文章，是隨時可以找得到的；甚且，有些刋物，竟然專門靠此以行世。</p>
<p>遊記隨筆之類，在今日之所以會大量的生產，作者或許也是有他們自己的苦處的。　苦處，大槪是由於生在此亂離之世，旣不願歸依權　，（或是鑽營無門），做些歌功頌德的奴才文章，又懾於槍刀，不敢正面反抗，寫些非議。世道，矯正人心的大作；如要閉口含默，不問世事，不但内心殊覺不快，還生怕每天的三餐白飯問題，無法解决；所以，只得選好這一路，同跑上去了。晋朝淸談之風，極盛一時，明末小品文，能風靡於世，其理由或許也就在這裏。　　生在擾攘不安的中國，尤其是在這充溢着煤烟氣的大都市，人們的精神生活，是受到萬分的壓抑和不舒適的。自已旣沒有到高山大川去看勝蹟，去鬆舒一口氣的淸福，走入深林名山做個隱士，又更是辦不到的；所以，睡在亭子間裏，讀讀名人們的遊記隨筆之類，倒也得到刹那間的淸閒和安慰。望梅止渴，就是這一個道理。</p>
<p>人們是需要一點小小的安慰的；但是，由於這些遊記隨筆之類所得來的安慰，是否會弄到人們對於人間世的情形，都糊塗隔膜了呢？這誰都不敢說。</p>
<p>湮滅了二三百年的明末的小品文的風氣，現在又似乎有復活之象了。本來，主趣不强括，法不凖古，見從已出，不效顰古人的明末性靈學派，其見地是很對的，一個忠實的作家，是不可不這樣做，就在數百年後的現在來提倡，也並不失其本來的價値。但，可惜的是，現在的一班作者，竟沾汚了前人的主張，而大行模仿起前人的作品來的這一點。</p>
<p>記得魚迅在小品文的危機一文中說：生存的小品文，必須是七首，投槍，能各讀者一同殺出一條生存的血路的東西，我們現在不是不需要小品文，而是不滿意於現在找不到七首投槍這類的東西。</p>

<p>「王先生收到我們的信？」北平太太微笑着。</p>
<p>「剛收到我就到這裏來，和君揚三年不見了。」心中却是——眞有他！那個個不懂得女人的傢伙！</p>
<p>「君揚時常說起王先生，一個漂亮的男子。」銀鈴似的笑起來，然而那樣自自然，一個可以使君揚在都市女人面前吐口氣的北平太太。</p>
<p>「君揚老說笑話，他說着玩的。」微微抬起身體說話，却是考爾門的眼珠子在對面衣櫉的鏡中瞥着卓别林的頭髪，希佛萊的鼻子各嘴巴，及衣襟上雪白的絲巾角。</p>
<p>——一個漂亮的男子？成羣的都市女人，紅嘴唇的小姐，高跟鞋老打着拍子的舞女包圍着他，但是「誰會愛他們」！沒有一個姑娘上世界貿易公司經理先生敏蓀的考爾門的眼珠子。</p>
<p>收回視綫來見對方迷人的笑着，再對衣襟上的絲巾角瞥了一眼，抽着烟，維持着紳士的態度。</p>
<p>「王先生，沒有事嗎？」北平太太誤會了意思。</p>
<p>「沒有！」微微搖動卓别林的頭髮，表示那樣有禮貌，「君揚大槪就要回來來吧？」</p>
<p>「他找幾個朋友去，也許到世界貿公司，他知道王先生已到這兒來。一定就回來的！」</p>
<p>第二枝烟捲親熱的授上來的時候，外面輕微的叩着門。</p>
<p>「君揚回來了。」敏蓀幾乎失了紳士的風度跳起來。</p>
<p>北平太太洩着輕快的步伐，那樣飄飄然然像女神一樣。開個門，穿白制服的侍者卑躬的說：</p>
<p>「太太，有電話。」</p>
<p>太太返過身來，「王先生，請請寛望一會。」</p>
<p>「請便。」</p>
<p>站起身送了太太出門，敏蓀就在房内徘徊。他瞧見房中到處有一位漂亮的男子行走着：卓别林的頭髮，考爾門的眼珠子，希佛萊的鼻子和嘴巴，及衣襟上雪白的絲由角。</p>
<p>——地傢伙，騙了漂亮的女人回上海來，眞有他！但是想起了他揮揮手的「我失戀了！」不禁希佛萊式的笑着；立卽像被人發見了秘密似的歛了笑容，對鏡子整了整領帶，回到原來的座位上去，那樣有禮貌的整襟危坐。</p>
<p>在北平太太當前，他發見了自已的渺小。</p>
<p>有紀律的高跟皮鞋聲行近門來，太太顯然是個跳舞的能手。——那傢伙坐咖啡館坐來的吧？</p>
<p>「王先生，眞笑話！君揚說被朋友拉住了脫不了身；我說王先生不是你的月友嗎？人家已來了半天，不見得沒有事的！</p>

<h3 id="c275">震動蘇聯電影界的名導演路姆褫職事件 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 巽之</p>
<p>本年三月十九日，蘇聯人民委員會直轄電影事業主務局以疾風迅雷的手叚，褫奪了蘇聯第一級導演Ａ·Ｍ·路姆（Ｒｏｏｍ）的在電影界的職位，同時還决定交付查問委員會議處一切，這事件震動了整個蘇聯影界，凬時他得影響還波及了世界各國。在蘇聯，有第一級導演之榮譽的技術員現在祗有五人，就是（一）「普巧姆金」和「新的與舊的」的愛森斯坦（Ｋ·Ｓ·Ｅ）「四個女性」的休勃女士（ＥｓｔｈｅｒＳｖｈｕｂ），（四）「帝國的碎片」「呼應計畫」的埃姆來爾（Ｅｒｍｉｅｒ），和這兒要說的以「大事業計畫」成名的路姆。在蘇聯，第一級導演有最大的威權和名譽，可以由自己的意思選擇劇本，可以自由地製作影片，所以列名第一級導演的褫職，無疑地是本年蘇聯電影界的一件大事。路姆在一九二零年初期，已經陸續地製作了「死港」，「奸細」，「第三梅西街」等等名作，「不歸的幻影」，是他代表的成功之作，一九三零年，他完成了蘇聯最初的同時也是最偉大的藝術聲片「大事業計畫」，他的聲名和新銳的聲勢，不在普特符金和愛森斯坦之下。這次的褫職事件的原因，是爲着工作散漫，和浪費公欵。他自從「大事業計畫」以來，已經休息二年以上，直到一九三三年二月，開始計畫新作，最初預定從二月至五月爲凖備期間，五月到次年五月攝影完了，可是路姆在這期間之内不曾决定攝影計畫，不曾寫好完全的攝影台本，以漫然無方針的態度工作，至本年二月一日爲止，在預定製作費六十萬羅布中，計已消費五十萬九千羅布，而攝成影片，則祗全片百分之五。因此，第十七次蘇聯黨大會認定路姆的行爲爲官僚主義的蔑視責任，在第二次五年計畫突擊過程中，斷難容許，遂决定褫奪職位，交付懲戒，以爲一般電影從業員之誡。三月十九日由主務局主席委員休米志基名義發表上項决定，同時還决定了莫斯科攝影所藝術製作部長施惠尼基監督不力，莫斯科綜合電影工塲主任梅它洛夫處理無方，壛付訓斥。路姆事件，與去年普特符金受譴斥事件，頗多類似之處，因爲普特符金於前年起開始攝製「脫走者」新片，這片子以德國工人運動爲題材，後來因爲德國客觀情勢激變，所以内容屢次改攝，以至原片消費四十萬呎，製作日期亦延長至二年以上，該片製成之後，藝術上雖有獨到之處，但觀點上則頗有錯誤，所以爲着明白責任，亦曾由電影事業主務局施以訓斥，從上述兩件事件，可以知道蘇聯電影事業的組織的統制，與第二次五年計畫中電影從業員的那種悽愴與悲壯的情緒也。</p>

<p>— 王本禧</p>
<p>自有重大的意義　何必利用肉感？</p>
<p>演員方面，都有相當成績，無可庛議。</p>
<p>談瑛飾年靑的寡婦、表情深刻，活　出一個雖在舊禮敎的更壓迫下，而好靜止的心靈，所希求着春之滋潤的少女。談瑛轉變作風後的成績，遠超過她以前的作品。但她畫提折柳絲一般的眉毛，和燙着的頭髮，却與劇中人身份不合。雖然這問題屢次有人糾正，却終不爲製片當局所注意。幾幕肉感的鏡頭，也覺得無謂。一部偉大的作品，自有牠重大的意義，何必利用肉感？</p>
<p>最後，我以爲如「暴雨梨花」「良宵」等作品，如果能利用有聲，將更可增强劇中情緒，雖然這部影片的字幕，也簡潔動人，但總不及有聲的强烈。</p>

<p>— 徐梅蘭</p>
<p>一位女子的呐喊</p>
<p>我看了這張片子，不禁發生了一種感想。</p>
<p>禮敎究意意吃人嗎？這個問題，我懷疑了好多年了，現在「良宵」裏牠已經很明白的答覆我，牠說：「禮敎是要吃人的，被吃的，尤其是我們女子。」</p>
<p>在一夫一妻的原則之下，夫妻雙方應該互相保守着貞操。妻死了，夫再娶。那末夫死了，妻去再嫁，無疑的也是一件正而且當的事情，但是我國的所謂禮敎，牠却不然了，牠祇允許了男子死了妻，是可以再娶，而女子死了丈夫，却不能再嫁。她是應該爲死去的丈夫守節的，爲了奬勵這種節婦起見，於是便連帶產生了貞節牌坊。試問，這守節，究竟有什麽意義，這顯見得是摧殘我們女性，可憐這種殘酷不人道的制度下，幾午年來，不知被呑噬了我幾千萬女同胞的生命。在一班人所認爲莊嚴的神聖的貞節牌坊之下，不知抑壓了多少我女同胞活潑的靈魂，這是一件何等悽慘何等寃酷的事情啊　！</p>
<p>現在該是我們起來反抗的時候了。我們爲我們自己前途幸福計，我們不能再屈服在這種不人道不合理性的制度之下。我們應該一致起來與這吃人的禮敎來交戰，來肉搏。我們必以最大的勇氣，來打倒她，以贖回我們的自由和幸福</p>
<p>女同胞們，看了「良宵」拿綢帕來拭滬，這是沒有用的呀！</p>

<p>— 思痛</p>
<p>書於觀「良宵」後</p>
<p>事實上，封建勢力和舊禮敎到今仍是根深蒂固地屹立着。牠束縛了多少人們的心靈，摧殘而且葬送了多少可貴的人生。雖然，自五四運動以來，一部份的社會已算是得到了解放，（其實，不過是以頽廢，浪漫，肉慾······來代替了封建勢力和舊禮敎，根本離解放尚遠，這是令人最痛心的。）但除去幾個大都市和少數風氣開通的地方以外，多數同胞仍是在這種壓力之下展轉呻吟着。因此，反封建運動仍應再接再勵的幹下去，以求最後的勝利，走向光明的前途。「良宵」的出現，正所以給掙扎着的人們注射一管嗎啡針，我們不能說牠的取意已經失去了時代的精神。這是應當認識淸楚的一點。</p>
<p>可是，在這片中的最後結果，却不能令人滿意。朱英對於雲琳的環境與以十二分的同情，而且屢言「把她以火阱中救出來，」「打破禮敎的束縛。」······；雲琳和她的阿婆劉節母在種種壓力之下消逝了她們的靑春；以及族長，奸人，之僞君子的描寫和罪惡的暴露等等；結果，仍是只能與他們以輕微的口頭的懲戒，劉節母且竟犧牲了，這未免出於觀者意料之外，而且令人覺得不平，這樣，僞君子，暴徒，反而得到勝利，弱者終於還是弱者。未能指示一條明路給現在無數劉節母和雲琳。所以，劉節母的犧牲和雲琳的無歸宿，只給與人們多了一個歎息的資料。</p>

<p>黑人入天堂歌舞的節目，是很繁多的。亞爾等到他自已歌唱完了，連忙去看殷納絲。殷納絲。正在她的化妝室裏哭。她說哈雷一定是被她殺死了。亞爾對她哈哈大笑起來，說她發瘋了，哈雷不過受些皮塲，現在已經和弗林上尉回家去了，到了明天什麽事都沒有了。他說着輕輕地將一件披肩，替她圍在肩上，心裏想着以後要怎樣地去安慰她，使她忘情於哈协。他的一顆心是充滿了熱望。他要在一切完畢之後，回來告訴她他怎樣地愛她。他要自己送她回家去。但是等到他出去了一回。回來的時候。湯梅已經在殷納絲的化妝室裏了。湯梅看見了亞爾，連忙喚他進去。亞爾進去了，但是看見了他們二人，都比自己年輕，並且顯出輕憐密愛的神氣，自己朱免有些忸怩。他看見殷納絲臉上還是塗着許多化妝油，就說道：「小心臉上的油，把你們粘住了。」殷納絲聽了就將一條手巾遞給湯梅。湯梅連忙接了過來，喜不自勝地替她擦着臉上油。他一面擦，一面說道：「蜜，這不是和從前一樣了嗎？」他又對亞爾解釋道：「從前她臉上的油，總是我替她擦的。現在不擦已經很久了。」</p>
<p>亞爾看了那副神情，自己心中未免難受，就對着殷納絲道：「等一回兒，我送你回家去。路上吸些新鮮空氣，你一定就覺得好些了。」他們却默然了一回，然後殷納絲說道：「好，你待我太好了。」湯梅站了起來說道：「好是好的，但是，亞爾，我新譜了一支歌，要彈給她聽。讓我送她回去好了。」殷納絲不知不覺地將一隻手拉着湯梅的手。」亞爾死着不在乎的神氣道：「那亦好。」殷納絲道：「你和我們一同走，好不好？」湯梅亦說道：「好極了，你來和我們一同走。」亞爾笑着。他一臉的黑漆，因爲他還沒有卸裝，遮蓋了他内心的苦楚，因爲他的希望，現在全歸泡影了。他心裏明白他們兩個年輕人，是在可憐他一個年老人而加以仁愛哩。可是他臉上還裝得若無其事似的笑道：「坐着聽兩個小孩子唱山歌？我可不幹」他走向門去了。他說：「祝你們快樂吧。這實在是他至誠的祝福，但是他自己不知不覺地」肩膀癱軟了下去。</p>
<p>一夕的歌舞歡娛完了。桌子都空了。紅紅綠綠的紙條都斷了。瓶裏的花都乾了。一個疲倦的歌劇者，正在擦去他臉上剩留的一些黑油。他最後一個從奇異酒店裏走了出來。酒店裏電燈，一盞一盞地熄滅了，顯出東方漸放光明的魚肚白。一個賣報童子，己在呌喊着號外。亞爾咬了咬嘴唇，向那賣報童子招着手。他買了一份號外。打開報的時候，他的心勃勃地，不平均地跳着。然後他深深地吸了一口氣。什麽事都沒有了。殷納絲不要緊了。但是他不應當讓她知道的。那報上大題目是：「弗林上尉和着名舞者哈雷　車慘死。」（完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The 22nd was the second day of the National Financial Conference. At 11:30 AM, Kong Xiangxi led all members to the National Government to pay respects to Chairman Lin and receive his instructions. Mr. Lin offered much encouragement, hoping to establish a solid financial foundation for the future. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the four review groups, led by conveners Peng Xuepei and others, convened review meetings in the respective review rooms of the Ministry of Finance. It was decided to continue the meetings for review tomorrow. At 7:00 PM in the evening, Executive Yuan President Wang Zhaoming hosted a banquet for all representatives. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 11:30 AM on the 22nd, Finance Conference Chairman Kong Xiangxi, along with chairmen Zou Lin and Qin Fen, led more than sixty attending members from various provinces and cities to pay respects to Chairman Lin of the National Government. After the members successively entered the National Government, they first rested and gathered in the first conference hall of the National Government. After the Chief of Civil Affairs and the Chief of Military Affairs reported to the Chairman, they first entered the auditorium and stood on either side. The members then entered the main hall in single file and stood in three rows facing the platform. Immediately, Chairman Lin appeared, and everyone bowed three times to the Chairman. Chairman Lin then delivered a speech, followed by a response from Kong Xiangxi. Everyone then bowed once more to the Chairman. The Chairman withdrew first, followed by the Chief of Civil Affairs and the Chief of Military Affairs, and then everyone withdrew. Chairman Lin's speech to all members was roughly as follows: Since the global economic depression, the finances of all countries have fallen into difficulty, and our country has also been greatly affected. After the September 18th Incident, the national crisis has become serious, and domestic finances have become increasingly difficult. Fortunately, since Minister Kong took charge of finance, he has been opening up new sources of revenue and cutting expenses, making great efforts to economize and rectify, and it has gradually become stable. This time, the financial conference is convened, firstly to rectify land taxes and local finances, and secondly to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes. Both are urgent tasks at present. If there can be practical solutions, it will be very beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Everyone is rich in experience in finance. I hope that you will use your knowledge and experience to work hard and study so that after this conference, the national income and expenditure will be balanced, and a satisfactory result can be achieved in finance. I also wish you all good health. Kong Xiangxi then gave a speech on behalf of all members, saying: "I have just received the Chairman's instructions, and all colleagues are inspired. Before the founding of the Republic of China, our country's finances were extremely chaotic. Since the founding of the Republic of China, due to many national misfortunes, it has not been stable. Xiangxi has falsely held the position of Minister of Finance, and I feel that my talents are lacking. However, during this time of national crisis, I will do my best to serve the country. Recently, in view of the decline of all industries in the country and the bankruptcy of the countryside, it is appropriate to strengthen the state's tax revenue. Therefore, the Second National Financial Conference was convened. Now, representatives from various provinces and cities and directors of various departments and bureaus have been able to come to Beijing to attend, which proves that they have sympathy for rectifying our country's current finances. We will abide by the Chairman's instructions and strive to create a new path for the country's finances." Regarding the overall planning proposal, Wang Chengying and others were designated to draft it. Regarding the proposal on dividing central and local revenue and expenditure, Zhu Jingzhou and others were designated to draft it. (Ding)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Problem of Salt Transport by Sailboats in Shierxu: Wang Boling Meets with Kong Xiangxi to Negotiate and Decide on Both Temporary and Fundamental Solutions <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the issue of sailboat transport in Shierxu is very important, so it specially dispatched Commissioner Wang Siboling to negotiate with Minister Kong. Mr. Wang came to Beijing from the Beijing-Hangzhou Railway yesterday and met with Minister Kong at the Ministry of Finance. Because of the continuous petitions of boatmen, who were crying and complaining about their hardship, they were also planning to find ways to maintain it. Commissioner Wang then described in detail the advantages and disadvantages of wheel transport and sailboat transport, the policy of drinking poison to quench thirst by increasing salt tax, the exhaustion of salt merchants, the danger of future tax revenue, and the fact that Yangzhou's public security, education, charity and other funds all rely on public welfare donations. It was decided to adopt two policies: temporary and fundamental. The temporary solution is that the Ministry of Finance will order the Huaihai Salt Transport Office, led by concurrently Transport Envoy Miao, to return the 200 tickets on the Anhui shore to sailboat transport as usual, and convert 200 tickets on the Hunan shore to one ticket for sailboat transport to maintain the livelihood of the boatmen before June. As for approving wheel transport and ordering the change to sailboat transport, Commissioner Wang will be responsible for handling it on the merchant side. The fundamental solution is to consider the proportion of 500 tickets for wheel transport in the 1,300 tickets that have been decided, and to allocate sailboats and wheel transport equally in turn. First allocate sailboats, and then, in order to increase the Mao tax and collect Yin, etc., policies such as intercepting the nets will be restored as usual. The local public welfare donations, etc., will be reported and written off by the receiving agency, and no separate reporting agency will be established to maintain the Yangzhou area. After this matter, the boatmen have suffered great pain. Such a solution is also a glimmer of light for the sailboat boatmen in Shierxu. (22nd Central News Agency Electric Dispatch)</p>

<p>Sichuan has long been known as a land richly endowed by nature. In terms of area, it is nearly 1.3 million square miles. In terms of population, it exceeds 72 million. Moreover, the development of its handicrafts and the advancement of its agriculture are no less than those of the provinces in the Southeast that were developed earlier. Unfortunately, over the years, Sichuan Province has been beyond the reach of the central government's long arm, leading to the formation of separatist regimes. The warlords within the province, wielding their own military power, engage in internecine strife, contributing nothing to the nation and providing no benefit to the people. If this continues, it will only worsen the people's livelihoods, creating more opportunities for bandits to incite chaos. Furthermore, the strong neighbor's encroachment on Tibet has been relentless, advancing inch by inch. Now, they are even encroaching on Xikang from Tibet. Xikang is the border region of Sichuan. If Xikang falls, the situation in Sichuan will become even more precarious. Looking ahead, one cannot help but feel a chill of fear.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Zhang Gongquan, the general manager of the Bank of China, traveled to Sichuan Province for an on-site inspection. He recognized the local abundance of resources. Apart from some copper and iron, most of the mineral resources have not been exploited. The salt wells of Zigong and Wutongqiao, the natural gas, and the by-product petroleum are still mostly exploited using traditional methods with only slight utilization. If modern scientific knowledge were applied to promote them extensively, the profits would be immense. Mr. Zhang was deeply moved by his inspection and suggested introducing Shanghai financial groups to invest in the region. However, whether this can be realized depends first and foremost on the stability of the political situation in Sichuan, followed by the long-term vision of the financial groups. Any person with foresight should know that our country is currently surrounded by dangers and faces many thorns in the future. The industrial organization of Sichuan Province cannot easily compete with others in the short term, and even rural agricultural products are suffering from the pressure of dumping. To alleviate the current difficulties and seek future prospects, attracting capital for development is essential. From the perspective of the investors, investing in Sichuan offers immense benefits. Sichuan has a dense population and an abundant labor force. Its agriculture is also quite developed, with sufficient food for self-sufficiency. At the same time, Sichuan itself serves as a consumer market for its products. Transportation is also convenient due to the Yangtze River waterway. All of these advantages are rarely seen in other border provinces. Therefore, Mr. Zhang's advocacy for investment is not without reason.</p>
<p>However, private investment inevitably involves some risk. Investors will first consider the safety of their capital, followed by the issue of profits. The instability of the current situation in Sichuan is well-known. It is difficult to ensure the safety of new ventures. Having military support might be helpful, but the rapid turnover of Sichuan warlords and the fact that business operations require ten to twenty years offer no practical solutions. Moreover, can the fickle warlords be fully trusted? Some might say that the situation in Sichuan is gradually moving towards unification. However, there is no complete understanding between the two Liu's, and the armies of Deng, Tian, and Yang still control their respective territories. Furthermore, the rampaging of the Red bandits poses a significant obstacle to stabilizing the situation in Sichuan. Given the current situation, even investors with a broad vision would hesitate greatly. This can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>Therefore, to realize the large-scale investment and development of Sichuan, the political situation in the province must first be stabilized in the short term. Furthermore, a solution must be found for the existing armies within the province, either by relocating them to the border regions or by engaging them in land reclamation. If the purely consuming armies can be transformed into organized production groups, then there will be hope for political clarity, and private investment can flow in continuously.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Roosevelt's Message to Congress: Advocates Passing the Silver Bill, Silver as 25% of Currency Reserves, Fixing Silver Purchase Price at 50 Cents per Ounce, Concluding a Global Bimetallic Agreement <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress today advocating legislation to make silver 25% of the US currency reserve. The main points of the message are as follows: 1) Buy domestic silver at a price limited to 50 cents per ounce; 2) Seek to conclude a global bimetallic agreement as the ultimate solution to the silver problem; 3) Request Congress to authorize the acceptance of excess domestic silver not needed by industry at an appropriate price, and regulate the import and export of silver and other transactions; 4) Advocate levying a tax of at least 50% on profits from silver transactions; 5) Request Congress to pass this legislation during the current session. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt submitted the silver bill to both houses today. This message is extremely important, as it aims to quell the aggravation of the monetary issue in this session of Congress. In his message, the President declared that the US currency reserve should be expanded to include silver, in order to complete the current monetary reform policy. The President proposed that the silver bill be passed in this session of Congress, stating that US policy will continue to increase the use of silver as currency, until the reserves reach a ratio of 75% gold and 25% silver, and requested Congress to grant the power to purchase silver to facilitate this ratio. The President also stated that the gold bill is only part of a far-reaching plan to reform the US monetary system. We should continue to move forward, expanding reserves, stabilizing the purchasing power of our currency, and achieving a balance in debt repayment. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Roosevelt's Concessions to Silver Supporters Have Political Implications; Mackay's Suggestion Difficult to Implement; Observations from London's Financial Circles <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(London) London's silver circles anticipate that President Roosevelt will not make any startling pronouncements to Congress today. Roosevelt's concessions to silver supporters are a political maneuver aimed at maximizing the political benefits for the United States with the least possible disruption on the international stage. There has been much speculation here regarding the backlash in China due to the sudden rise in silver prices. It is generally believed that China will not allow its export trade to be destroyed. If the United States buys silver on the world market, China may sell its silver reserves and adopt the gold standard. Mr. Mackay, the former general manager of Jardine Matheson in Shanghai, today disclosed a letter in London responding to Mr. Deterding, the general manager of Royal Dutch Shell, stating that he could not imagine Shanghai property speculators swaying Chinese bankers. He believes that if countries with large gold reserves hold 20 to 30 percent of their hard currency reserves in surplus silver, the silver reserves could be absorbed. In addition, silver demand could also meet supply and demand. A well-known silver expert told a Reuters reporter today that he knows there is not enough silver supply on the market to meet the 25% reserve requirement for US currency, so Mackay's suggestion cannot be implemented. He believes this move could raise silver prices to 30 or 35 pence per ounce, which China cannot accept. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e28">League of Nations Optimistic About Russia Joining; Rumors of a Franco-Russian Military Agreement; Exclusion of Germany and Japan; However, French Media Deny the Matter <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Parties connected to the League of Nations are currently very optimistic about the prospects of Soviet Russia joining the League. Soviet Russia previously requested that it be invited to join by a full vote of the League of Nations Council, similar to the procedure used for Mexico. It is now reported that Soviet Russia has abandoned this request. After Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov met with French Foreign Minister Barthou last week, France agreed to nominate Soviet Russia and seek election by the League of Nations Council, which requires a two-thirds majority for admission. The meeting between the two foreign ministers was initiated at the request of the Russian side. They also discussed disarmament issues and the Soviet Union's proposed mutual security pact. However, reports circulating in some quarters suggesting that they also discussed a mutual defense alliance are considered inaccurate here. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) It has been widely rumored here recently that during Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov's visit to Geneva, he and French Foreign Minister Barthou agreed on a Franco-Russian military agreement. The only remaining issues are minor procedural matters. It is also said that Foreign Minister Barthou has reported and discussed the contents of the agreement in detail during cabinet meetings. One newspaper even explicitly declared that Britain and other powers have the possibility and freedom to join the agreement, but they must have the same goal, which is to exclude Germany in Europe and Japan in Asia. It is said that the Soviet government believes that the time is not yet ripe to declare war on Japan, but after the situation between Russia and Germany becomes clear, Russia will shift its focus and begin negotiations with Japan. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated its willingness to maintain peace in the East and hopes that Britain, Italy, and Poland can join the Franco-Russian agreement. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a report in a major American newspaper, French Foreign Minister Barthou and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov apparently discussed a Franco-Russian defensive alliance treaty during their recent meeting in Geneva. All French newspapers have rejected this claim, saying that such news is alarming and practically absurd. Consider the following reasons to see why this claim is unbelievable: the League of Nations Covenant does not permit member states to enter into secret special treaties. Even local consultations (as detailed in Article 21 of the Covenant) must conform to the spirit of the Covenant and be registered with the League of Nations to be valid (as detailed in Articles 18 and 20 of the Covenant). Since the Soviet Union is not yet a member of the League of Nations, it would never enter into a secret alliance treaty with France, as it would increase the difficulty of joining the League. Therefore, if France and Russia want to enter into such a treaty, they must do so within the framework of the League of Nations. Moreover, a defensive alliance treaty is not something that can be easily accomplished. How could it be hastily concluded in a matter of hours without the preparation of lawyers and experts? Considering these two reasons, it can be seen that the report in the American newspaper is entirely based on speculation. However, the discussions between the French Foreign Minister and the Soviet Foreign Minister have not only greatly benefited Franco-Russian relations but have also had a positive impact on the evolution of the League of Nations, as the scope of the League of Nations should encompass the entire world. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) "Le Temps" published an editorial commenting on the recent talks between Foreign Minister Barthou and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in Geneva, stating: "The talks between Barthou and Litvinov were quite cordial. Litvinov currently has great power over Soviet foreign policy. He will soon be conducting negotiations with the foreign ministers of the Little Entente. The relationship between Moscow and Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia is undoubtedly becoming closer, and the rapprochement of the four countries is a prelude to Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. International figures are already openly discussing Soviet Russia's accession, and if this happens, it will have a significant impact. The Soviet Union's accession not only demonstrates that the Soviet Union is rejoining the so-called capitalist group of European countries, but it will also greatly change the League of Nations' position. This is especially important because after Japan and Germany successively left Geneva, the League of Nations felt quite empty internally. If the Soviet Union can join, its situation will be transformed again. There are various benefits to Soviet Russia joining the League, such as expanding mutual non-aggression pacts and clearly defining aggressor states, which is the main principle of Moscow's foreign policy. Promoting this will provide more practical security in general, which is a benefit of Soviet Russia joining the League. However, there are also some dangers, which we should prevent by reliable methods." (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>Sofia: After the Bulgarian coup, the whole country is peaceful and quiet, which is really beyond everyone's expectation, because people at all levels have acquiesced to the success of this coup, and according to the opinions expressed by reliable observers, the people of the whole country of Bulgaria have long been aware that the countless small political parties previously fighting each other are more harmful than beneficial to the country, so they are eager to ban them as soon as possible. At present, in addition to military patrols on the streets of the Bulgarian capital, there are no other revolutionary phenomena. The new Minister of Military Affairs, Shilyadov, said in a radio broadcast today that in these few days, the Bulgarian army has completed its task of saving the country. Afterwards, the people of the whole country must unanimously support the work of the army and the national government. In the future, the government authorities must fundamentally and severely deal with all internal political disputes brewing by various separatists. Furthermore, the former tobacco strike in southern Bulgaria, which previously threatened to spread throughout the country, has now been resolved. This is also a good phenomenon after the establishment of the new Bulgarian government. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Premier Georgiev of the Bulgarian capital recently ordered that the salaries of all ministers be reduced by 50 percent. There are also strict restrictions on the use of cars by ministers and senior officials. Ministers are no longer allowed to travel in special cars. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Sofia: This morning, the former cabinet handed over power to the new government. Former Premier and Foreign Minister Muchanov gave a farewell speech to the members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that Bulgaria's international status has been improved in recent years thanks to its diplomatic policy. He is very pleased that the new government's foreign policy will remain the same. The new Premier Georgiev, who is temporarily also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, echoed Muchanov's speech, saying that Bulgaria's reputation abroad has indeed grown in recent times. The new Premier is 52 years old this year and has made numerous achievements in the successive Balkan Wars and the European War. In 1925, he served as Minister of Railways. Later, Georgiev organized a non-partisan group whose purpose was to unite all national forces to thoroughly reform political, economic, and social life, and to establish a strong government.

<p>(New York) US labor unions are now continuing to take a tough offensive to seek employer recognition of the unions. Striking workers seem to be increasingly prepared to take violent actions to achieve their goals. The Steel and Tin Workers Union in Sandy Hook, representing 100,000 workers, is demanding recognition from employers. 35,000 construction workers in Minneapolis City are offering massive support. Today, workers and police clashed violently. The workers used seven-section staffs and threw bricks, resulting in 18 police officers and 11 strikers being injured. Dock workers in New Orleans clashed with police, and both sides fired multiple shots, resulting in many strikers being arrested. The number of striking dock workers in Pacific coastal ports now totals 12,000 and is increasing daily. Striking dock workers in San Francisco drove away 50 Japanese sailors who were unloading goods. Such incidents are too numerous to mention. However, the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Labor rushed from Washington to investigate the situation and still hopes to resolve the dispute. Currently, maritime transport along the Pacific coast is almost completely paralyzed. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(New York) Mr. Ryan, the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, will leave here after Wednesday to assist in resolving the dock strike on the Pacific coast.

<p>(New York) Yesterday, the labor sector in many parts of the country showed instability. Experienced observers here believe that this is a prelude to a major labor strike at the end of this summer. The current strike is not like past strikes, which only demanded increased wages and shorter working hours. Its main goal is the issue of union recognition. The American Federation of Labor has decided to wage a resolute struggle against the major industrialists in the country. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Recovery Affairs Investigation Committee, chaired by Darrow, issued a report severely attacking the Recovery Bureau. After this incident occurred, officials and General Johnson, the head of the Recovery Bureau, were greatly shaken. Those involved in the secrets of the Recovery Bureau have had conflicting opinions since the report was released. One faction supports the conclusions of Darrow's report, while the other faction opposes the report and expresses sympathy with General Johnson, creating a danger of internal strife. Darrow's Investigation Committee intends to issue another statement today, saying that General Johnson strongly believes that the points made by the committee criticizing the Recovery Bureau are false, but cannot provide concrete evidence. Darrow also said that General Johnson and legal counsel Richberg roared like madmen when they heard the committee's assessment that their operations were not perfect and could not be improved, as if they regarded the Recovery Bureau as their private property. Darrow's statement said that the committee will issue another report describing the situation of several industries, which is even worse than what was described in the first report. Darrow will also ask the Recovery Bureau to clearly explain whether it allows certain industries to engage in monopolies. Most newspapers regret that General Johnson and Richberg responded to Darrow's report with insults instead of calmly accepting it. As for the Investigation Committee chaired by Darrow, its enthusiasm is somewhat untimely. It is likely that the President will order its dissolution. There is no doubt that the committee's report can be used as a tool to attack the government by those who oppose the recovery efforts. Many people are concerned for the President, believing that the Investigation Committee was originally established at the initiative of Roosevelt, but as a result, it wantonly attacked the government's recovery efforts. In Roosevelt's words, this is like slapping his own face. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The resignation of the Saito Cabinet is now only a matter of time. The political world is gradually showing signs of an impending storm. The House of Peers observes the current political situation as follows: since things have reached this point, the resignation of the cabinet is inevitable after all. In order to avoid confusion in the political situation, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance must inquire about the opinions of the elder statesmen and deal with them properly regarding the successor. Therefore, the resignation will take place at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. The head of the next cabinet will be either Vice President of the Privy Council Hiranuma, Governor-General Ugaki, or Count Kiyoura. However, Count Kiyoura is too old, and some elder statesmen oppose Mr. Hiranuma, so it is unlikely to be realized. The result will definitely fall to Governor-General Ugaki, but some in the army also oppose Governor-General Ugaki. However, if Ugaki can follow the army's opinion, in other words, the direction of Army Minister Hayashi, then the realization of the Ugaki cabinet is not difficult. Once the imperial mandate is given to Ugaki, he will inevitably organize a cabinet based on the personnel of political parties. However, it is difficult to find a Minister of Finance who will not change the current financial policy of Takahashi. (Den-tsu, 22nd)</p>

All members except the Minister of Railways attended. Finance Minister Takahashi requested the understanding of each cabinet member regarding a certain major incident, saying, "As the Finance Minister, I deeply regret this incident. I intend to first focus on stabilizing the morale within the Ministry of Finance." Prime Minister Saito also reported on his attitude, stating, "There are many rumors about this incident. Currently, the truth of the incident is not yet clear, so it is not the time for the cabinet to take any measures. Before the incident is clarified, we intend to continue to observe the situation." The meeting adjourned at noon. Furthermore, the true intention of the Prime Minister's report, according to various sources, is that after the truth of the incident is clarified, the current cabinet intends to carry out a complete resignation.

<p>(Tokyo) The Minrinkai held an emergency board meeting at 2 PM today. President Tanaka and others attended. They issued a statement saying, "The Saito Cabinet should resolutely settle its responsibilities at this time," and discussed that the succeeding cabinet must be one that is unrelated to established political parties and zaibatsu. (22nd, Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito believes that the collapse of the Saito Cabinet is only a matter of time, and the leadership has begun to discuss countermeasures. The Ugaki theory is quite influential regarding the succeeding cabinet. However, if the Ugaki Cabinet is realized, it will naturally be organized on the basis of political parties. The Minseito intends to support this with the entire party and have party leaders as representatives in the cabinet. However, the attitude of the Seiyukai, especially the possible entry of Tokonami Takejiro into the cabinet, is becoming a problem. However, the result is that the Seiyukai will undoubtedly send cabinet members. However, the opposition to the Ugaki theory from the military, especially the navy, has not yet been resolved, so its realization will inevitably face considerable obstacles. If a dispute occurs, some observers believe that the Kiyoura Cabinet will be realized. The Minseito also intends to provide the same support for the Kiyoura Cabinet. On the other hand, the "Seiyu-Minsei Coalition" faction, led by Suzuki Masaya, the president of the Seiyukai, does not believe in the Hiranuma theory at all. (22nd, Dentsu Telegram)</p>

It is believed that the parliamentary group will be able to avoid this. Even if the government adopts reactionary policies, Mr. Malvy will be able to respond appropriately. The motion also requested that the Second International recognize the New Socialist Party and advocated for the implementation of necessary social reforms.

<p>(British-French): Today (May 22nd), the opening price was 77 francs 28, up 7 pounds from Saturday's closing price. Subsequently, due to very little demand for francs, the price slightly loosened, so it fell to 77 francs 09, 19 pounds lower than the opening.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) At 8:50 PM on the evening of the 22nd, a person wearing a gray military uniform suddenly came to Jiuhua Silver Shop on Hangzhou Zhongqing Street. Under the pretext of buying gold jewelry, he robbed two gold rings, used a pistol to threaten them to keep silent, went out the door and fled towards Zhongqing Lane. When the shop reported to the police for pursuit, the robber had already gone far away. When the shops on the street heard the alarm, they all closed their doors, and panic was extreme.

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The matter of the Japanese army in Tianjin forcibly occupying land in Balitai, Nankai, Tianjin to build an airfield is still under negotiation as of today. The protest letter sent by the Tianjin Municipal Government to the Japanese Consulate on the 7th of this month will be half a month old by now. The Japanese side has always ignored it, causing our side to feel that the Japanese attitude is unfathomable, and the negotiation feels there is no way to start. On the 17th of this month, the Municipal Government issued a second protest based on the recent investigation report from the Provincial Public Security Bureau, stating all the legal responsibilities of this matter, based on the original land lease of Guangrentang, should be borne by the Japanese side, and reserved the right to claim compensation for damages before the negotiation is resolved. The Provincial Public Security Bureau ordered the police in the Second District to send competent police officers to patrol the area near Balitai in plain clothes every day. The progress of the Japanese construction was reported to the Bureau several times a day, and the Bureau forwarded it to the provincial and municipal governments. As for the airfield's embankment project, more than 130 acres have been completed. No less than 140 or 150 workers are working every day, supervised by several Japanese police officers in shifts, speeding up the work. Ignorant workers, incited by the Japanese, are unusually hostile to Chinese people passing through the area, so many people have been driven away and injured recently. The Central Government has not yet sent any instructions to Tianjin regarding this matter. The Provincial Government is handling this matter in accordance with the wishes of the Beiping Military Branch, temporarily maintaining a calm attitude. All materials have been compiled and submitted to the Central Government, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to preside over negotiations with Japan. The Municipal Government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the original land lease of Guangrentang, why it was transferred from Zhang Shaoqing's name to the Japanese Okura Company. The landowner, Guangrentang, is concerned that if the dispute expands, the company is the original owner, fearing that it will not be understood by the people of the country, so it filed a lawsuit with the Tianjin Local Court yesterday, requesting to summon the original tenant, Zhang Shaoqing, to the court to recover the land property rights and cancel the original contract. Although this move cannot make the Japanese people who enjoy extraterritoriality submit, it is sufficient to prove in the negotiation process that the Japanese side did not obtain the consent of the original owner and started construction on the land. However, silently judging the intention of the Japanese side, no matter how we protest and sue, it cannot prevent their construction from proceeding. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Tragic Scenes After the Disaster in Northern Sichuan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>--The Number of Deaths in Guangyuan Alone Exceeds 100,000--</p>
<p>--Epidemics are Prevalent in Xuanhan, Resulting in Even More Deaths--</p>
<p>Chengdu Aviation News: The counties in northern Sichuan that fell into the hands of bandits have now been gradually recovered, but the people have suffered extremely deeply. The number of deaths is more than one million. Even those who are fortunate enough to survive are mostly homeless and displaced in foreign lands. The remaining small portion who have returned to their hometowns are also without clothes, food, cattle, or seeds, and have no way to cultivate the land. At the moment, Liu Xiang, the Sichuan Pacification Supervisor, and Zhang Lan, the Pacification Committee Chairman, have decided on a strategy of suppressing bandits on one hand and pacifying the people on the other. However, the affected counties number 16, and the surviving people number 6 to 7 million. With Sichuan in a state of public and private hardship, where will the huge sum be raised to save these refugees? The future is worrying. The following is an excerpt from the report of the investigation into the disaster areas of Guangyuan and Xuanhan counties dispatched by the official Pacification Committee to see a glimpse of the situation. If the central government does not take measures and the people of the country do not provide assistance, starvation and cold will be more pressing than fire and cattle. Once it breaks loose, the harm will be endless.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Investigation Report on the Bandit Area of Guangyuan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The situation of Guangyuan County being ravaged by bandits, according to the investigation reports of Pacification Committee investigators Wan Chucheng and Pang Mingshi, is excerpted as follows: (1) The red bandits engaged in extremely severe massacres wherever they went. According to the Protection Bureau's roster, there were about 17,000 people massacred near Wangcangba. In the four townships, there were more than 100 pits of massacres that could not be investigated, about 7,000 to 8,000 people. More than 2,000 people were killed at Puziling, more than 3,100 people were killed at Mumen, more than 30,000 people were killed at Changchi, more than 800 people were killed at Luojiaba, more than 300 people were killed at Wulangmiao, and more than 900 people were killed in the Pinghe and Daheba areas. A total of more than 230 people were killed at Liulisi and Fenshuiling. More than 170 people were killed at Dahui Houba. Excluding Changchi, which is under the jurisdiction of Nanjiang, the Guang-affiliated districts 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 had a total of about 32,600 people massacred by the bandits. As for the corpses seen along the way from Guangyuan to Nanjiang, they often numbered in the tens of thousands. Half of those killed in a pit were buried alive. The corpses of women either had children on their backs or infants in their arms. Most of them had wooden sticks inserted into their vaginas. It can be said to be the most tragic sight in the world. In the Yang family's outhouse at Puziling, seventeen or eighteen young children, all two or three years old, were thrown in and drowned while hugging their heads. In the rich households' granaries in Changchi and Mumen, there were many full of human heads. All of this was done by the communists when they were leaving. As for the traces of killing when the bandits first arrived and last year, they have not yet been discovered because the refugees have not returned. I am afraid that once a detailed investigation is conducted, the number of people who died unjustly in this year will be more than the 100,000 mentioned in the previous telegram. (2) About one-twentieth of the civilian houses in each district were burned down, and more than two-tenths were demolished. As for the rest, all the windows and doors were gone, leaving only four walls. (3) The grain in each district had already been completely transported away by the time the bandits retreated. The refugees who remained in the bandit areas still had some grain left to maintain the current situation, but those who fled back to their hometowns had nothing left and could not maintain their livelihood. The people mostly eat tender grass and wild vegetables. There is also an extreme shortage of grain seeds. Many rice paddies have already been leveled, but there are still no grains to sow. The county government is rushing to transport and distribute them. (4) Most of the people in each district who were coerced by the bandits have returned from the front lines of Nanjiang recently because the military and the government have been lenient and not investigating the past. (5) The eastern districts 7, 8, and 9 have been lost for the longest time, and the banditization of various places is also deep. Under the Soviets, there are economic communes, cooperatives, etc. However, the bandits arbitrarily massacred, thus losing the sympathy of the people. (6) Although the sections of Wangcangba, Puziling, Zhenwugong, Miaoerwan, Mumen, Fenshuiling, Nulangmiao, and Malingba in the seven districts have been completely lost, destroyed, and ravaged, fortunately, the winter grain in each place has all been cultivated. To this day, one can still see the bandits' slogans of "Strive for Autumn Harvest, Strive for Cultivation," which shows that the bandits also attached importance to grain cultivation, so there is little wasteland. However, at that time, people were uneasy, and the cultivation was perfunctory. Later, the military and bandits clashed, and irrigation was neglected. When a timely rain fell, the seedlings and grass grew together, which also affected the quantity of the harvest. However, the land for growing tobacco in the past accounted for about one-tenth of the total area. This year, it is all cultivated for grain, compensating for the shift, and may be no different from normal years. However, now that the grain is running out, and there are survivors after the robbery, there is bound to be a sigh of empty pots and broken stoves, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Investigation Report on the Bandit Area of Xuanhan <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Xuanhan investigators Li Shuyang and Lin Ze investigated the situation in the county as follows: (1) Guandu, Changxi, Huangjinkou, Xiagengkou, Dongshengchang, and other places in Xuanhan were heavily re-occupied by bandits, and many residents were displaced. The livelihood of the people in Dongshengchang is also very dilapidated. However, the most tragic place is Huangjinkou. The grain and rice buried underground by the people have fortunately survived, but the seedlings of peas and rape are almost completely gone. The spring harvest is mostly no more than 10%. Although there are now few troops and refugees left, and the disaster has been eliminated, people are starving to death every day. Hujiacheng, Maoba, Yanshanchang, and parts of Mingguchang, Chixichang, and Maduguan were heavily re-occupied by bandits. Many people were killed, and even more fled. Moreover, the main forces of both sides fought fiercely for more than two months, with corpses all over the fields. The seedlings that were trampled on were innumerable. Not only have many displaced children not returned home, but the local groups have not yet been restored. The remaining waters and mountains are unbearable to look at. In the future, disaster relief measures must be given special emphasis, otherwise it may not be enough to preserve the survivors. Although there is a worry about the lack of food in the various Changs below Aikou, they have been recovered for a long time, and there are no other unexpected losses, so rescue is easier to carry out. (2) The grain seeds in Xuan territory are mostly problematic. At the moment, the personnel handling emergency relief are conducting on-the-spot investigations and providing subsidies to the various towns that are unable to purchase and transport rice seeds, taking into account the situation, from the emergency relief funds they are carrying, so that they can handle it themselves. If it is not enough, they can report back to the county and add more funds. Although there is bound to be a worry about too many monks and too little porridge, in the midst of this financial difficulty, we can only save the emergency situation first. (3) At present, epidemics are prevalent in the various Changs of Xuan territory, especially in the northwest two districts. After inquiring, the number of patients in each Chang is counted in the hundreds, and eight or nine out of ten die without effective treatment. Generally, they die within eight or nine days. After diagnosis, enteritis typhus accounts for eight or nine out of ten, and influenza accounts for two or three out of ten. Treatment is very difficult, especially for enteritis typhus. In the aftermath of this great disaster, money and medicine are both empty, which is deeply worrying. Moreover, the infectious characteristic of enteritis typhus is that the stronger the person, the easier and more severe the illness they suffer, and the faster they die. I think that agricultural labor and hard work all rely on strong men. Now, in the aftermath of the bandit disaster, many strong men have been lost. The work of farming and harvesting mostly falls to the bodies of healthy women. Overcoming this epidemic, what will be the future? Furthermore, from spring to summer, the scorching sun is increasing day by day, and the spread of the infection will have a prairie fire potential. We want to treat but cannot, and we cannot not save. This is what we worry about. We only pray that we appeal to medical and charitable organizations inside and outside the province to send enthusiastic and intelligent doctors with a large number of enteritis typhus preventive injections to inject everywhere. Those who are not sick can be guaranteed not to get sick, and those who are already sick may not be allowed to die, which is a great contribution to preserving the survivors. The investigation shows that the infection is from food and spring water. The duties, etc., have persuaded people to pay attention to cleaning techniques and to set up calamus, Atractylodes lancea, and Asarum roots in drinking water to kill germs. However, in this time of difficulty in making a living, how many can do it, and how many can believe it? Chang is not known. (National News Agency)</p>

<p>Since the opening of the road for motor vehicles, the water and land transportation in Songcheng has become increasingly convenient. Visitors from outside the area come to Songjiang in droves. Li Zufu, the chief of the first district, believed that Ximen Street, where shops gathered, had a large number of vehicles entering and leaving, and the street pavement was already broken and sunken, or the ditches were blocked, and rainwater accumulated on rainy days, soiling clothes and shoes, which greatly hindered pedestrians. Therefore, it was decided to hire workers day and night to repair the section from Suspension Bridge to Pagoda Bridge. Work was done at night from Suspension Bridge to Long Bridge, and work was done during the day from Long Bridge West to Pagoda Bridge to maintain traffic. Also, because the Huayang Bridge in the eastern suburbs has not yet been leveled, it is quite inconvenient for passengers to get on and off the bus at the bus station. It is also planned to rebuild it. A letter has been sent to Xu Chunbo, the town mayor of the town, inviting local people to gather together to discuss fundraising and planning, and report for approval. Once the bridge is leveled, the bridges in Songcheng can all be used for traffic.</p>

<p>Yangchenghu in the county has always been a place where bandits haunt. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, shipowners Zhou Zhilin and Zhu Rongxiang loaded 1300 bags of salt from Liuhe and went to Wujin to unload it. Unexpectedly, when they reached Yangchenghu near Bacheng Town, they suddenly encountered two bandit boats. There were more than ten bandits on board, armed with guns, who boarded the ship to rob. When Zhou and others saw this situation, they did not dare to resist. The bandits immediately loaded the salt onto the bandit boat, fired a gun to show off, and set sail. Afterwards, Zhou immediately reported to the Bacheng Public Security Bureau, which sent police to pursue them, but the bandits had already gone far away.</p>

<p>Mao Yijun, the director of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, has been working diligently to search and arrest smokers and gamblers for a year since taking office. On the evening of the 11th of last month, Director Mao again dispatched officer Sun Zhongjie to lead the police to arrest 16 gamblers, including Zhu Wangshi, at Zhu Hongda's home under Tatan outside Nanmen. Each was fined, and the bureau issued a receipt for the fine. Recently, a teacher named Hou Zhuoying from a primary school outside Nanmen collected 11 fine slips from this case and had them photographed by a photography studio, pointing out that this fine slip had not been reported. Unexpectedly, officer Sun Zhongjie of the bureau found out about it and went to a photography studio without authorization, daring to bring out five photos of the fine slips taken by Hou and hand them over to a lawyer, personally notifying a lawyer by telephone and urging them to proceed, etc. Director Mao of the branch bureau found out about it, thinking that Sun was unpredictable, so he went to the general bureau to report to the director. Director Chen immediately dispatched Chief Wang Inspector to lead a team of car patrol officers to the third branch bureau at 9:00 AM the day before, summoning officer Sun Zhongjie, employee Pu Jihong, police chief Liu Desheng, office police officer Xu Yi, Shao Liren, Wang Fusheng, etc. to the general bureau together, and searching Sun Zhongjie's bedroom and home once. Later, he ordered to summon the gambler Zhu Wangshi and the head of the map, Pan Hongqi, to the bureau. After Director Chen personally questioned them, he ordered Sun Zhongjie and Xu Yi to be suspended from their duties and taken into custody, and Pu Jihong, Shao Liren, and Wang Fusheng to be released on bail. All the others were ordered to return. Yesterday (the 22nd) at 8:00 AM, Director Chen prepared a document and sent police to transfer Sun Zhongjie, Xu Yi, Pu Jihong, Shao Liren, Wang Fusheng, Liu Desheng, and six others to the local branch of the court for handling. However, it is heard that the director of the branch bureau, Mao Yijun, has also resigned himself.</p>
<p>Chen Diaoyuan</p>
<p>Develops the Longwei Inkstone Stone of Wuyuan</p>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: Longwei Mountain is a branch of Furong Ridge, a hundred miles east of the county, connecting Wuxi in the west. The mountains are clear and the waters are beautiful, stretching for more than a hundred miles. The mountain produces inkstone stone, which is the most famous, especially the golden star, jujube core, eyebrow, and brocade patterns are the most valuable. The mountains producing inkstones in that place include Longwei Mountain, Luowen Mountain, Meizi Pit, Jinxing Pit, Biyu Pit, Shuixuan Pit, Shui蕨 Pit, Ye Jiu Pit, Xitou Pit, Lu Pit, Jiyuan Pit (all of the above are in the east of the county), and Lingyan Mountain (in the north of the county), etc., eleven places. However, the stones from each mountain pit have been abandoned since the Northern Song Dynasty, and the years have been lost, and they are all barren. The name of Longwei has long become a historical trace. This time, Chen Diaoyuan led his troops to station in Wuyuan. Seeing that the burial and abandonment of Longwei inkstone stone was a pity, he summoned the county squire Jiang Youbai to the headquarters a few days ago to inquire about the situation of the inkstone stone. According to Jiang's answer, the stone pit has not been opened for many years, and it is full of sand and stones. The location of the stone seedlings is mostly unknown. Only one old man in the village can still remember it. To mine this stone, one must wash away the accumulated sand and stones before one can find and recognize the source of the stone. However, it requires a huge amount of money, which is difficult to start. Chen believed that this stone was so valuable that he decided to take advantage of the fact that this guide was still actively developing it, and invested 1,000 yuan himself, ordering County Magistrate Liu to order the district to start washing away the sand and stones, and then find a way to collect them. After Liu received the order, he was already preparing to proceed. From now on, the Longwei inkstone stone, which has become the Guangling San, will be re-pioneered, and soon it will give a new contribution to the literary and artistic circles. (May 17th)</p>

<p>Liu Zuomin, the former director of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau in this county, and his wife, Wen Rongzhen, were arrested by County Magistrate Yan and sent to the former County Court for questioning because of their resistance to the transfer of power. After the court's prosecutor's office investigated, it was determined that Liu Zuomin and Wen Rongzhen definitely had obstructed official duties, so on the 30th of last month, they filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court of the same court. It is now known that yesterday (the 20th) was the first day for a public hearing of this case. At 2:00 PM, Judge Liu brought Liu Zuomin and Wen Rongzhen, who were in custody, to the court together. First, he questioned Liu Zuomin, who did not admit to resisting the transfer of power and hiding official seals, etc., and also supplied that Li Shuyun, the wife of Gu Renfa, did not go to Wuxi, etc. Next, Wen Rongzhen was summoned for questioning. Wen testified that she was really wronged in this case. I knew Li Shuyun four or five years ago on a train in Hunan. Liu went to Wuxi to serve as the director of the branch bureau, and I did not tell Li Shuyun that. On the day of the reception, I did not fight with the members from the General Bureau. At that time, because Liu was in the town, I asked the members to come again in a day. Unexpectedly, they wanted me to be responsible for the transfer, and later they put me under surveillance and did not allow me to move freely, etc. By this point, it was already past 5:00 PM. After the interrogation, it was still ordered to be returned to custody and await review.</p>

<p>Important Matters</p>
<h3 id="e105">Compilation of Proposals from the National Financial Conference Regarding Local Finance (Submitted by the Minister for Discussion) 1st: Reorganization of Land Tax <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Land tax is the oldest tax in our country, but also the one with the most deeply ingrained malpractices. Since the 17th year of the Republic when land tax was assigned to local finance, surcharges have increased daily. Their complexity, harshness, and disorder are difficult to fully understand. The Fourth Plenary Session of this year approved two proposals to reorganize land tax and reduce surcharges. The Executive Yuan has ordered separate implementation. However, the land tax situation is complex and varies from province to province. Implementation standards urgently require joint discussion to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>A. Implementation of Land Reporting: The Fourth Plenary Session passed the general outline for land reporting, and the Executive Yuan decided on supplementary measures. The following draft articles of the Land Reporting Implementation Regulations are specifically formulated for uniform regulations in implementation, to facilitate discussion and collect opinions from all parties. The following points should be noted: (1) No handling fees will be charged for land reporting; (2) Reporting procedures and forms should be simplified. After reporting, tax rates should be revised to ensure an even burden; (3) Formal tax registers compiled by each county should have uniform regulations; (4) The tax collection system should be improved immediately after reporting; (5) The tax collection system should be improved immediately after reporting.</p>
<p>B. Standards for Reducing Land Tax Surcharges: The severity of land tax surcharges varies from province to province and county to county, in some cases exceeding ten times the principal tax. The ways to effectively reduce or eliminate them should be determined on a case-by-case basis when reviewing budgets, and tax rates should be revised after land reporting to achieve a comprehensive solution. The following articles are proposed as restrictions before land tax is fully reorganized: (1) Land tax surcharges should not exceed the total amount of the principal tax. In areas where the principal tax rate is originally low, the combined principal and surcharges should not exceed 1% of the land value; (2) Regardless of whether land tax surcharges already exceed the principal tax, provinces and counties are prohibited from increasing them for any urgent needs or under any pretext starting this year; (3) Temporary mu (unit of area) levies and apportionments in counties, districts, townships, and towns should be strictly prohibited. If expenses are incurred per mu for the public interest of the district, township, or town, the province should formulate regulations for stricter restrictions; (4) Surcharges collected for a fixed term or for a specific purpose that no longer exists should be abolished immediately and not used for other purposes or continue to be collected.</p>
<p>2nd: Improving the Local Tax System</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the National and Local Revenue and Expenditure Standards in the 17th year of the Republic, all items previously under the central government, such as deed tax and broker tax, were assigned to local governments. After the central government implemented the abolition of likin (internal transit tax) in the 20th year of the Republic, the business tax law was promulgated, and provinces and cities began implementing business tax. Local governments now have various taxes, and their scope is expanding daily. It is urgent to carry out rectification to increase financial resources. Increasing regular tax revenue must precede the easy abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. The following is a breakdown of the points that should be rectified for the existing local regular taxes and the unification of tax collection agencies for discussion.</p>
<p>A. Business Tax: Since the implementation of business tax, more than two years have passed. Apart from a few provinces that have achieved some results, most have encountered numerous obstacles and have failed to achieve the expected results. Based on the experience of the past two years, it is believed that several aspects of the collection method need to be improved: (1) Investigation Certificates Should Be Changed to Tax Certificates. Article 3 of the Business Tax Law originally stipulated that merchants should apply for a business tax investigation certificate. However, this article does not clearly define the items to be listed on the investigation certificate. Tax collection agencies in various provinces and cities issue investigation certificates based on the matters in Articles 3, 1-4, that merchants must follow when applying. The amount of tax payable by business operators is not specified in the certificate. Furthermore, the name "investigation certificate" is not very suitable. It is proposed to issue business tax certificates in the form of licenses, without charging any fees, and require merchants to display them, using the tax certificate as the basis for collecting taxes. The tax certificate should specify the following: 1. Business type and store name; 2. Business operator's name, place of origin, and residence; 3. Taxable standard and tax rate; 4. Annual tax payable; 5. Average tax payable per period. The tax certificate should be renewed annually without collecting any fees. (2) Limits on Tax Rate Grading: Currently, provinces and cities use both capital and turnover as taxable standards. No province or city uses net income as the standard. The number of grades into which the tax rate is divided is often too detailed, causing inconvenience to both taxpayers and tax collectors. It is proposed to divide the tax rate into three grades for those taxed on turnover and four grades for those taxed on capital. A grading table is attached separately. (3) Limits on Industry Classification: Business tax collection is based on industry. The number of industry types currently divided in various provinces and cities is too many and inconsistent. Uniform regulations are urgently needed for sorting. The level of the tax rate is related to the nature of the industry, and it is even more necessary to have separate standards. An industry classification table and an industry classification tax standard table are attached separately. (4) No Tax Collection on Goods: Business tax should be collected on employment in principle, not on goods as the unit of collection. Collection from the sale and manufacture of goods should be limited to those with a fixed place of business or manufacturing site. Business tax similar to likin should not be collected on goods. (5) Strict Adherence to Tax Collection Restrictions: The standards for business tax rates are clearly stipulated in Article 4 of the Business Tax Law. Article 5 stipulates that businesses with a turnover of less than 1,000 yuan or a capital of less than 500 yuan should be exempt from tax. It is necessary to strictly adhere to this provision so that small businesses can receive the practical benefits of tax law protection.</p>
<p>B. Broker Tax: The problems with broker tax in various provinces and cities are mostly due to the inconsistent taxable standards, the absence of fixed restrictions on the commission rate, and the imperfect collection system. According to Article 10 of the Business Tax Law, there is a provision to temporarily change to business tax according to the original tax rate. The broker tax should be reorganized to gradually bring it into the legal scope of business tax, to eliminate harassment. The following points should be reorganized: (1) Limit Brokerage Firms: Brokerage firms should have fixed trading posts in counties, cities, towns, and market trading locations, regardless of whether they are operating in the short or long term. They are not allowed to set up card checkpoints or intercept and collect commissions along the road in trading markets. (2) Determine the Responsibilities of Brokerage Firms: Brokerage firms are intermediaries for the sale of goods. They should be responsible to the buyer for the completeness of the goods sold, and responsible to the seller for compensating the price of the goods sold. They should not dispatch brokers to solicit customers outside the port before the goods arrive. They should not force customers who directly buy or sell goods to consign the goods through brokerage firms. They should not prevent customers who have already arrived at the port from consigning the goods through other firms. (3) Restrict Brokerage Commissions: The brokerage commission rates vary greatly from province to province, ranging from about 1% to 5%. Now that agriculture and commerce are in difficulty and prices are falling, restrictions should be imposed. It is proposed to uniformly limit the maximum to 3%, with provinces and cities considering local trading conditions and determining the restrictions accordingly. (4) Brokerage Business Tax: The standard for brokerage taxation should be based on transaction or sales volume. The standards for brokerage taxation vary from province to province, with some based on sales volume and others on brokerage commissions. As a result, the tax rate borne by brokers is often disproportionately high or low. It should be stipulated that the annual or quarterly business tax payable by brokerage firms (i.e., regular tax) should be based on the total sales volume introduced by them. (5) Abolish Itinerant Brokers: The nature of brokerage firms varies from province to province. Some brokers are itinerant, operating in the open air. Although they also collect commissions after obtaining permits, they do not have fixed trading posts. They mostly collect commissions directly on the goods, which is illegal and disruptive, and creates many malpractices. The tax revenue does not compensate for the losses. These brokers should be abolished uniformly. (6) Strictly Correct Improper Collection Methods: Provinces and cities should not have broker tax that is disguised as a commodity tax. Brokerage firms that have been contracted by merchants through bidding or entrusted by government agencies to collect taxes should only be allowed to do so for the period specified in the contract. All such arrangements should be abolished after the contract expires, and there should be no more terms such as contract collection, special collection, or delegated collection, to eliminate harassment.</p>
<p>C. Deed Tax: Deed tax rates vary from province to province. In addition to the principal tax, there are many surcharges, which leads to more and more people hiding prices and evading taxes, which in turn affects the principal tax. In addition, transfer and tax deeds are completely separate matters. Property transfer is avoided due to concealing tax payment, which also avoids transfer tax. Grain pillars (tax payment receipts) lack evidence, and malpractices are even deeper. The following are several ways to reorganize: (1) The deed tax rate is tentatively set at no more than 6% for sales deeds and no more than 3% for mortgage deeds; (2) Deed tax surcharges should not exceed half of the principal tax; (3) Transfer tax should be processed at the same time as deed tax. Tax payment and transfer should be processed at the same time; (4) Uniform deed forms should be formulated. Transfer and the amount of principal tax payable should be stated in the deed. All transfer stamps can be abolished.</p>
<p>D. Unification of Collection Agencies: Today, local tax collection agencies are too complicated, with approximately four types: (1) Business tax bureaus specifically for collecting business tax; (2) County government finance bureaus for collecting land tax and other provincial and county taxes; (3) County government finance sections for collecting provincial and county taxes in counties without finance bureaus; (4) Bureaus and offices of other departments for collecting special funds (such as the Slaughtering and Brokerage Tax Collection Office in various counties contracted by Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office. In other provinces, the county finance bureau or county finance section is entrusted to collect the tax on their behalf). Among these four types of collection agencies, only the business tax bureau has a clear and specific responsibility and can be fully responsible to the finance department. The rest, due to different affiliations, lead to various malpractices such as shirking responsibility and encroachment. Contractors are even more difficult to supervise and direct. If we want to establish the foundation of local finance, we should unify the local tax collection agencies. All business tax, broker tax, pawn tax, slaughtering tax, and special funds originally collected by various departments should be collected uniformly by the local tax bureaus established by the finance department in each county. Only in this way can the improvement of the tax system, the audit of collection, and the training of tax collectors begin. Furthermore, the people will only know that there is one tax payment agency, and they will not be deceived by tax officials. The method of unification is as follows: (1) In order to unify the collection of local taxes, each province should establish a local tax bureau in each county. All business tax, broker tax, pawn tax, slaughtering tax, and other provincial and county taxes and fees should be collected and remitted by the bureau; (2) Each county's local tax bureau is under the command and supervision of the finance department. The organizational regulations are determined by each province; (3) After the establishment of the local tax bureau, all previous methods such as bidding, contracting, and entrusting collection should be abolished.</p>
<p>3rd: Abolishing Harsh Taxes and Miscellaneous Fees</p>
<p>Since the first National Financial Conference in the 17th year of the Republic resolved to divide national and local revenue and expenditure standards and promulgate it, local taxation should be based on guidelines and follow a proper path. However, local taxes and fees have become increasingly burdensome, and calls for reform are endless. The reason for this is that at the beginning of the reform, there were omissions. Some items were only listed but never implemented (such as the surcharges on income tax, which is a nominal item). Some items were prepared but then abolished (such as the inland fishing tax, which was explicitly exempted). Some new sources of revenue were slow to develop or failed to achieve results (such as the business tax, which was originally a major source of local revenue, but was not successively implemented by provinces and cities until after the abolition of likin in the 20th year of the Republic, and the amount collected was not very strong). Some should have revised the tax system according to law, but they have not been revised or have become even worse (such as local broker tax). The Business Tax Law stipulates that business tax should be temporarily changed according to the original tax rate. However, various provinces and cities have not revised it or have changed it to contracted collection, delegated collection, and taxation on goods. Because local governments' expenditures have gradually increased and the foundation of revenue has not been consolidated, they have been eager to choose any method to meet the needs of their operations and have independently established items and taken money from the people. As a result, harsh taxes and miscellaneous fees have come one after another, harming businesses and disturbing the people. To reorganize local taxes and fees, it is necessary to define the types and scope to clarify the system, and it is even more necessary to clearly define the collection procedures to show uniformity. Based on current laws and regulations and the current tax system in various provinces and cities, the types and scope of local taxes and fees are defined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Land Tax Category: 1. Land tax (including current land tax, grain tribute, rent tax, salt tax, fishing tax, reed tax, etc.); 2. Legal land tax surcharges (not exceeding the principal tax, and in areas with low principal tax rates, the combined principal and surcharges should not exceed 1% of the land value); 3. Land value tax collected in accordance with the Land Law; 4. House tax or shop tax (collected according to the property or rental value of the house); 5. Deed tax; 6. Deed tax surcharges.</p>
<p>(2) Business Tax Category: 1. Business tax collected in accordance with the Business Tax Law; 2. Broker tax, pawn tax, slaughtering tax, etc., that should be changed in accordance with the Business Tax Law; 3. Business tax that should be banned in accordance with the law (such as vehicle tax, boat tax, advertising tax, etc.).</p>
<p>(3) Conduct Tax: 1. Collected directly (such as divination, astrology, etc.); 2. Collected indirectly (such as banquet tax for restaurants, entertainment tax for theaters, etc.).</p>
<p>(4) Public Welfare Tax Category: 1. Fees collected from beneficiaries and vehicles or other users for improving or repairing all land and water conservancy projects (such as road construction tax, dike construction tax, water conservancy tax, pier tax, warehouse tax, port affairs tax); 2. Fees collected from the people by local governments or autonomous organizations for public welfare or health undertakings, in accordance with legal procedures (such as health tax, street light tax).</p>
<p>(5) Handling Fee Category: 1. Paper prices for official documents collected by local governments at all levels in accordance with the law; 2. Deed prices collected by local governments at all levels in accordance with the law; 3. Various fines collected by local governments at all levels in accordance with the law; 4. Verification fees, handling fees, and registration fees collected by local governments at all levels in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Since the above-mentioned scope of taxes and fees collected locally has been determined, the collection procedures should be specified in detail to achieve the effect of effective reorganization, and local governments can have a basis for avoiding difficulties. The following points should be specified first in the collection procedure: (1) Provinces and cities that collect taxes and fees legally listed in this proposal and that began collecting before the State Council promulgated the National and Local Revenue and Expenditure Standards in November of the 17th year of the Republic should list the name, purpose, tax rate, estimated collection amount, and collection month of the taxes and fees in a special report to the Ministry; (2) Provinces and cities that collect taxes and fees listed in this proposal but that have not been implemented in accordance with current laws or regulations and that began collecting after the State Council promulgated the National and Local Revenue and Expenditure Standards in November of the 17th year of the Republic should list the name, purpose, tax rate, estimated collection amount, and collection month of the taxes and fees in a special report to the Ministry and forward it to the Legislative Yuan for review; (3) Starting from the 23rd year of the Republic, provinces and cities shall not collect any taxes and fees outside the scope stipulated in this proposal without legislative procedures; (4) Provinces and cities shall not change the original tax items or tax rates without the provisions of laws or regulations; (5) If the collection of taxes and fees or the increase or decrease of tax items by provinces and cities conflicts with the provisions of laws or regulations, the Ministry of Finance may stop or revoke them at any time; (6) Local governments at all levels may collect the fees listed in the handling fee category, but they must collect them in accordance with the provisions of current laws or regulations and report them to the superior government or the competent department for record.</p>
<p>Since there are detailed decisions on the scope and procedures for the collection of local taxes and fees, taxes and fees that exceed the legal tax rate range or that exceed the scope stipulated in this proposal should be regarded as harsh and miscellaneous taxes and abolished. The types are as follows: (1) Surcharges on central taxes; (2) Taxes and fees that harm social public interests; (3) Taxes and fees that harm the source of central revenue; (4) Duplicate taxes that are the same as current taxes; (5) Taxes and fees that obstruct transportation and are collected on the passage of goods or vehicles; (6) Taxes that unfairly tax the import of local goods for the benefit of one locality; (7) Taxes and fees collected on the production or sale of goods; (8) Surcharges on current business tax; (9) All taxes and fees that harm the livelihood of the common people. All of the above should be abolished in stages from July 1, 23rd year of the Republic to the end of December 23rd year of the Republic. Those who have not been collected should not arbitrarily start them under any pretext or in any name, so that the people's suffering can be relieved as soon as possible, the foundation of local finance can be established, and the national economy and people's livelihood can be relied upon.</p>
<p>4th: Determining Local Budgets</p>
<p>To reorganize finances, the first step is to determine the budget. The above-mentioned matters of reorganizing land tax, improving tax administration, and abolishing harsh taxes and miscellaneous fees are all related to the budget. How should local budgets at all levels be prepared and executed to gradually bring local finance onto the right track and alleviate the people's difficulties? The problem is very complicated. Now, we will choose several points that are more important and more urgently needed to provide for discussion.</p>
<p>A. Division of Local Revenue and Expenditure between Provinces and Counties/Cities: When provinces and county/city governments prepare local budgets, they must allocate and control resources within their respective scopes. Therefore, it is necessary to establish specific standards for how provinces and counties/cities divide revenue and expenditure. However, the situations in various provinces are different. The standards for this division should be formulated by the provincial governments themselves and submitted to the central government for approval and implementation. However, the following points must be noted when formulating the standards: (1) Regarding the revenue and expenditure of counties/cities, the revenue and expenditure originally belonging to the counties/cities and their districts, townships, and towns should be combined into one. There should be no further division below the county/city level, so that the finances of the county/city and its districts, townships, and towns are unified; (2) Regarding the division of tax revenue, the attribution should be based on the type of tax, not on the distinction between principal tax and surtax. For major taxes that cannot be completely attributed to the province or county/city, they should be distributed according to percentages, so that the finances of the province and county/city each have a relatively stable foundation; (3) Regarding the division of expenditure, it should be based on the affiliation of its agencies and the purpose of its business facilities, so that the rights and obligations of the people in various places are reasonably equal; (4) After the division of tax revenue between the province and the county/city, they should not add surcharges to each other, so as to reorganize themselves; (5) After the division of expenditure between the province and the county/city, they must still assist each other when necessary to achieve balanced development.</p>
<p>B. Key Points for Formulating Regulations for Local Budgets of Counties/Cities: How local budgets of counties/cities should be handled is not specified in the current central budget regulations. Each province should formulate separate regulations for compliance. However, the following points should be noted in the formulated measures: (1) When county/city governments prepare and review local budgets, they must allow legal entities and citizens to participate and express their opinions to show financial transparency. The supervision of the budget must be carried out by agencies other than the administrative agencies to prevent malpractices. The Finance Committee established under the Regulations for Reorganizing Local Finances of Counties in the Bandit Suppression Area promulgated by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has the above-mentioned meaning and is very worthy of learning from; (2) All revenue and expenditure of local public ownership, regardless of its source or purpose, must be included in its budget to show its entire financial situation; (3) The budget items should be as clear as possible so that the general public can easily understand them; (4) The budget preparation and review procedures should be as simple as possible, using meetings and inspections to eliminate barriers, reduce document transfers, and save time; (5) The budget announcement date must be at least one month before the start of the year to prepare for implementation; (6) The execution of the budget and the supplementary budget must have strict regulations to prevent the abuse of harsh levies.</p>
<p>C. Matters to be Noted by Local Governments at All Levels in the Preparation of Budgets during the Period of Reorganization of Local Finances: (1) Local budgets at all levels should be based on revenue and expenditure to make them easy to establish and implement effectively; (2) Expenditure should be tightened as much as possible, and appropriate ratios should be set for administrative expenses and business expenses to reduce consumption and promote production; (3) Tax revenue should be listed as regular revenue, and illegal taxes and surcharges exceeding the quota can only be listed as temporary revenue until they are reduced to gain the people's understanding and tolerance; (4) The central and local finances are currently facing difficulties. Local budgets at all levels must find ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to adapt to the situation. They should not request subsidies from superior governments unless they encounter incidents or special facilities; (5) When the provincial and municipal local budgets are sent to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, a copy should be sent to the Ministry of Finance. After the provincial government approves the county/city local budgets, the provincial government should send a copy to the Ministry of Finance for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e112">First Proposal Group: Fujian Provincial Department of Finance <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Proposal to Implement the Reduction of Surtaxes on Field Taxes to Alleviate the People's Suffering in Accordance with the Ministry of Finance's Measures for Reorganizing Field Taxes Surtaxes.</p>
<p>(Reasoning) Upon investigation, the surtaxes on field taxes in various counties of Fujian Province are numerous and complex. Those belonging to the provincial treasury include a 10% surcharge for grain donation, ticket fees, a 20% collection fee, and a highway fee, totaling four types. Those belonging to the local governments include a county police surtax, education fee, new education fee, self-government fee, group fee, and other local surtaxes, totaling six types. Among these, the 10% surcharge for grain donation, ticket fees, 20% collection fee, highway fee, county police surtax, education fee, and new education fee are common to all counties in the province. However, approximately twenty counties also have self-government fees, group fees, and other local surtaxes. Among the three, the group fee is the heaviest. The method of collection is also very uneven. In terms of surtaxes on field taxes, the higher ones reach three yuan per tael, which far exceeds the amount of the principal tax. The lower ones reach one yuan, which is equivalent to half of the principal tax. If all counties uniformly collect this tax, based on the calculation of 50% of the province's grain quota, it would reach over 1.5 million yuan. No policy is more harmful to the people than this. Now, for the sake of addressing the root cause and ensuring clarity, the following reduction measures are proposed:</p>
<p>(Measures) 1. The Department of Finance shall draft a survey form for surtaxes on field taxes and issue it to all counties with a deadline for response. It shall investigate and ascertain the types of surtaxes existing in each county in addition to the principal tax on land and population, as well as their tax rates, amounts, and uses, in order to make separate approvals or exemptions based on this information. 2. If the surtax on field taxes exceeds the principal tax, regardless of the reason, it should be resolutely reduced. 3. After the surtaxes on field taxes reported by each county have been reviewed and approved, they shall be submitted to the provincial government for announcement. Hereafter, no expenditure, regardless of its nature, may be requested from the surtaxes on field taxes, nor may the cancelled surtaxes be used for other purposes. 4. If any county collects surtaxes on field taxes without authorization after approval, it shall be punished as privately collecting taxes. 5. The reduction procedure shall follow Article 4 of the measures promulgated by the Ministry, with administrative expenses being given priority, followed by project expenses. 6. After the surtaxes on field taxes have been reduced, the county government shall convene a meeting of various community organizations, gentry, and merchants to comprehensively plan for any shortfalls, or seek other sources of funding, pending the increase in the grain quota resulting from the re-measurement of fields to compensate for the shortfall. The above proposals are submitted for public deliberation to determine their appropriateness.</p>

<p>Proposal to Issue Land Reorganization Public Bonds to Conduct Field Measurement to Implement Fundamental Solutions for Reorganizing Field Taxes.</p>
<p>(Reasoning) Regarding the collection of taxes, nothing is more important than simple procedures, reliable tax sources, and fair burdens. The reorganization of field taxes cannot deviate from these principles. However, due to the chaotic nature of tax regulations, the mixture of population and grain levies, the loss of maps and registers, and the concealment of names in our country's field tax system, clerks and insiders engage in fraud, powerful individuals rely on their influence to resist payment, and taxes are arbitrarily levied and fraudulently transferred, resulting in numerous malpractices. To speak of reorganization, the only fundamental solution lies in "assessing grain based on land" and converting to a land value tax. However, implementing a land value tax must begin with measuring fields, which cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. It is necessary to temporarily adopt a "assessing grain based on households" as a temporary measure. Regarding the situation in Jiangxi, with the exception of counties such as Gao'an and Jing'an, which have well-organized volunteer drawing systems and can collect the full amount of taxes each year, most other counties collect only about 70-80% at most, and only 20-30% at least. The reason for this is that the grain registers contain many household names that are not easy to verify. Jian Tao's method of organizing volunteer drawing is a relatively effective way of assessing grain based on households. Therefore, by adopting the successful cases of volunteer drawing in Gao'an and Jing'an, and incorporating new regulations, a general rule for volunteer drawing has been drafted, and a procedure for implementation has been established. The main points include clarifying the names of grain households, compiling registers for collection, stipulating the responsibilities of drawing heads and township leaders, and limiting the period for clearing the drawing and verifying its accuracy. Since the issuance of these rules in the autumn of the year before last, only about twenty counties have reported their completion, due to local unrest and deeply ingrained habits. Even if it were implemented throughout the province, it would only be possible to hold the drawing heads and township leaders accountable for the names of the grain households. In terms of collection, it may gradually become effective, but the problems of having land without grain and having grain without land would still not be completely eliminated, which is not consistent with the goal of reorganizing field taxes. Therefore, assessing grain based on households is only a temporary measure. (Measures) The fundamental solution is to convert to a land value tax, because the purpose of the land value tax is to ensure that those who have land must have grain, and those who have grain must have land. In other words, the grain follows the land, and the land and grain are combined. Therefore, to adopt this tax system, it is necessary to first measure the fields and go through procedures such as investigation, valuation, and registration before it can be implemented. In July of the twenty-first year, Jiangxi entrusted the Aerial Survey Jiangxi Branch of the General Bureau of Land Surveying of the General Staff Headquarters to first conduct aerial surveys in Nanchang as a pilot project. By January of the twenty-third year, 8,615 original field maps had been produced. The work of investigation, calculation, mapping, and registration was handled by the Jiangxi Provincial Land Reorganization Office. The various tasks are nearing completion. Once the land value is assessed, land registration will be carried out to serve as the basis for abolishing the population and land tax and converting to a land value tax. However, the expenses for the aerial survey in Nanchang County and various tasks were shared by the eight counties of Nanchang, Xinjian, Fengcheng, Qingjiang, Jinxian, Anyi, Xingan, and Gao'an according to the amount of population and land tax. A surveying fee of 400,000 yuan was borrowed. It is now planned to continue using aerial surveys to produce original field maps for the ten counties of Xinjian, Fengcheng, Qingjiang, Jinxian, Anyi, Xingan, Gao'an, Linchuan, Jinxi, and Dongxiang. Considering the excessive cost in Nanchang, triangulation will not be used, and only longitudinal and transverse triangulation chains will be implemented for correction. The deadline for completion is two years. All tasks of investigation, calculation, mapping, registration, valuation, and registration will be carried out in sequence, and the deadline is also set at two years. The total cost is estimated to be over 2.22 million yuan. When the ten counties have achieved considerable results, the plan will be extended to the remaining seventy counties, which will require approximately 8.09 million yuan for aerial surveying and various tasks. The total cost will be over 10.31 million yuan. If this huge amount of funding is still borrowed and collected from the counties along with the grain tax, it would be difficult for the people to bear, considering Jiangxi's years of banditry and the bankruptcy of the rural economy. It should be centrally planned by the government to alleviate the burden on the people and achieve success. It is found that other provinces' land reorganization projects, except for Jiangsu Province, which collects surveying fees along with the grain tax and has sufficient funds for application, are generally hampered by a lack of funds and cannot progress. The surveying of fields and the implementation of various tasks are fundamental to the reorganization of field taxes. Although the land reorganization plan is approved by the Ministry of Interior, it is proposed that the Department centrally plan and manage the funding aspect. According to the needs of each province, the revenue from surveying and measuring fees will be used as a fund to issue land reorganization public bonds. The funds raised will be deposited in banks, or the banks will raise funds to underwrite the bonds using the public bonds as collateral, and allocate them as needed. The land administration agencies of each province will use these funds, and the Department will appoint accounting specialists to manage them. The surveying and measuring fees collected by each province should be deposited in banks for timely disbursement of the principal and interest of the public bonds, or for repayment of the underwriting funds. With funding in place, success can be achieved on schedule, and this can be used as the basis for promoting the land value tax, so that it conforms to the principles of simple procedures, reliable tax sources, and fair burdens. The most difficult to solve field tax problem in our country can also be easily resolved. It is submitted for public deliberation whether the reasons for proposing the issuance of land reorganization public bonds to provide sufficient funding for surveying fields are appropriate.</p>

<p>After arriving at the Diplomatic Building, the Panchen Lama rested briefly and then received reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city to give a speech, which was translated by his secretary-general, Liu Jianqiu. The reporter first asked how many days he would stay in Shanghai this time. He replied that he had come to Shanghai from Hangzhou in 1924 for a short trip to Putuo, so this was his second time in Shanghai. He planned to stay for a week to take the opportunity to tour the city and visit various construction projects, and then go to the capital.

<p>The reporter then asked when he would return to Tibet to preside over the major affairs of Tibet. He replied that he had been away from Tibet for a long time. Since the passing of the Dalai Lama, there was no one to preside over Tibetan affairs, so he was eager to return to Tibet. He had previously sent representatives, including Anqin, to Tibet, who had now returned to Beijing. He knew that the Tibetan people were eager for him to return to Tibet soon, and there were many letters and telegrams urging him to return. Therefore, after seeking instructions from the central government in Beijing, he would return to Tibet to preside over the government. As for the route back to Tibet, whether it would be via India or Qinghai, it had not yet been decided. The Panchen Lama believed that the Kangzang dispute was a local matter and not the entire Kangzang issue, and it would not escalate.</p>

<p>The reporter then asked how the Lama would bridge the gap between the central government and Tibet and enhance unity after returning to Tibet to preside over the government. He replied that he had come south in the early years of the Republic and had stayed in Beijing, Ping, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. He also had a general understanding of the construction projects in various places. After returning to Tibet this time, he would make efforts in various construction projects. He was determined to uphold the spirit of unity among the five races. After returning to Tibet, he would also promote the virtues and intentions of the central government so that the Tibetan people could fully understand the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People.

<p>Finally, regarding the Kalachakra initiation, he said that it was initiated by lay Buddhists in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou as a purely religious expression, with the purpose of praying for national prosperity, peace, and world peace. He was happy to preside over it, and now it was completed. When the Panchen Lama spoke, his attitude was extremely sincere. After each sentence, he silently recited sutras with his eyes closed, and his eyes were sharp and piercing, showing that he was a man of extraordinary wisdom.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in addition to the Panchen Lama, there were more than 60 lamas who had come to Hangzhou from Ping to participate in the Kalachakra initiation on the special train to Shanghai. After the special train arrived in Shanghai, these more than 60 lamas took five cars and left for the North Station. At 7:17 PM last night, they left for Nanjing to transfer back to Ping.</p>

<p>A Prelude to the Development of the Northwest</p>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, after Mr. Song Ziwen's return from his inspection tour, he believes that the Northwest, with its vast territory, is the only lifeline of the Chinese nation and that it is necessary to actively develop it. He is even more enthusiastic about the plan for the Construction Bank Corporation. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency has made a special recording of the recent preparatory situation of the company, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Submitting to the Ministry for Registration <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The initiators of the Construction Bank Corporation, including Song Ziwen, Li Shizeng, Kong Xiangxi, Bei Songsun, Shao Lizi, Yang Huchen, Tang Shoumin, Chen Guangfu, etc., have translated the previously drafted company articles of association, originally in English, into Chinese, and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for registration in accordance with the Company Law and the Company Law Implementation Regulations, requesting the issuance of a business license. As soon as the license is issued, they can publicly advertise for subscriptions, convene a shareholders' meeting, elect officers, and begin operations. It is heard that the registration fee of more than 600 yuan has been remitted to the Ministry and will be approved soon.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Determination of Share Subscriptions <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The capital stock of the Construction Bank Corporation is fixed at 10 million yuan. The full amount was subscribed by the initiators before Mr. Song's trip to the Northwest. However, in recent weeks, there have been some changes in the previously subscribed shares. The exact amount has been determined again recently. According to inquiries from various sources by the reporter, the exact amounts are as follows: Bank of China, 2 million yuan; Communications Bank, 1.5 million yuan; China Industrial Corporation, 500,000 yuan; Jin Cheng Bank and Zhongnan Bank, 250,000 yuan each; Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Continental Bank, Sze Ming Bank, Bank of Communications, and the Gold Exchange and Securities Exchange, 150,000 yuan each; Juxingcheng, Jiangzhe Bank, and Donglai Bank, 100,000 yuan each. In addition, the Central Bank subscribed 1.5 million yuan, and Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi are responsible for raising another 2.5 million yuan. The above totals 10 million yuan. Yesterday, Bei Songsun, manager of the Bank of China, told a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency that the 2 million yuan subscribed by the Bank of China is for the purpose of recruitment and will not necessarily be Bank of China shares in the future.</p>

<p>The Construction Bank Corporation is entirely for investment in the Northwest and is the overall authority for design, credit, investigation, and management for those investing in Northwest projects. Investment projects are very broad, including water conservancy, sanitation, animal husbandry, reclamation, and mining. The capital required is very large and is not limited to just 10 million yuan. In the future, if a project is to be developed in the Northwest and the entire plan requires capital of tens of millions of yuan, the bank can temporarily raise capital from various parties, design and operate the project. Investors can rest assured with the organization of this trust institution, without having to manage it themselves. This type of organization is used for domestic and foreign investment in European and American countries. It is very common and effective. Our country is 生 落後, and there is 談 唔到 about foreign investment. There is also no organized structure for domestic investment. The Construction Bank Corporation planned by Mr. Song will pioneer large-scale industrial operations in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Qingdao Industrial Inspection Delegation's Itinerary Yesterday and Today; Factories Hold Banquets for Several Days <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Qingdao Industrial Inspection Delegation, a group of seventeen members, after arriving in Shanghai, successively visited various factories. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, accompanied by Hu Shuchen of the China Industrial Federation, they continued to visit the Huacheng Tobacco Company on Huishan Road and the Yong'an Yarn Factory in Wusong. Guo Shun hosted a luncheon at the Yong'an Textile Company. After the meal, they toured Baotaiwan. In the afternoon, they went to the Dayouyu Oil Factory, where the factory director Xue Chunsheng led them to the Yaguang Electrical Wood Manufacturing Factory. Yaguang Company specially distributed daily necessities to all delegation members. Then they went to the Shufangnian Hong Company and the Tianyi Insurance Company, where the company manager Liang Nonglan specially prepared refreshments. They returned to their residence at six o'clock for rest. In the evening at seven o'clock, the Maochang Egg Factory held a banquet at the Dadong Restaurant to entertain them. Afterwards, Xue Chunsheng invited the delegation members to watch a play at the Tianchan Stage, inviting Wang Xiaolai, Guo Shun, and others to accompany them. This morning, they visited the China Chemical Industrial Society and the Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. At noon, the Donglai Bank hosted a banquet at the Dongya Restaurant.

<h3 id="e142">American Chamber of Commerce of California Vice President Peng De's Impressions of China: All Construction Affairs Must Not Adhere to Old Ways <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Press, Peng De, Vice President of the American Chamber of Commerce of California, has extensive experience in engineering. Recently, he and his wife have been traveling around the world. On Sunday (the 20th), they arrived in Shanghai from Pinghan. According to an interview with a reporter from the Continental Press, the general American public knows very little about Chinese customs, culture, and history. If this understanding can be developed, it will greatly increase the happiness of the Pacific region. This trip is his first time in China and he cannot stay long, but the unlimited potential for China's future development cannot help but move him. China has a large population and abundant resources, which makes it very promising. The most important thing is to build roads to facilitate transportation and unify the language. One thing that is surprising is that China still uses traditional methods to manage new-era construction projects. For example, a dam can be completed in one year using modern methods, but it takes five years using traditional methods. Is China's inability to achieve real progress due to adhering to old ways in all matters? According to Peng and his wife, they left Los Angeles on March 19th and spent several weeks traveling in Japan, Korea, and North China. According to Peng, there is no doubt that Korea has made progress, but Koreans are still openly opposed to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Mayor Wu Hosted a Banquet for Cai Ning Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>After Archbishop Cai, the second papal representative to China, arrived in China, he was warmly welcomed by all walks of life. Yesterday morning at seven o'clock, he held a Mass at the Catholic Church outside the Xinbei Gate to bless the faithful. He also visited the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart of Mary Church, where the Women's Catholic Action Association made contributions. He then visited the Catholic Church in the city and the Anlao Nursing Home on Jichang Street in the Nanshi area. Because Archbishop Cai had run a nursing home in his hometown ten years ago, he was very interested in this. At noon, at the invitation of Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city, he went to Wanglu on Haige Road for a banquet. Those who accompanied him were Counselor Archbishop An, Bishop Hui of Shanghai, Bishop Zhu of Haimen, the deans of various Catholic churches in Shanghai, the editor of the Shengjiao Magazine, Father Xu Zongduo, and others. Among the faithful invited to the banquet were Lu Bohong, president of the National Catholic Action Association, and his son Yinxeng, Song Hanzhang, director of the Bank of China, and He Lizhong, Gu Shouxi, Shen Xinsheng, and others, presidents of the Catholic Action Associations in various districts of Shanghai. Because Mayor Wu had important official duties, he did not arrive until one o'clock. He was received by Secretary-General Yu and Tang Shixuan, Geng Jiaji, and others. During the banquet, the atmosphere was lively with toasts and laughter. Afterwards, they took photos in the garden to commemorate the occasion. They dispersed at about three o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Tang Youren Explains Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations; The Key to Diplomacy Lies Entirely in the Northeast Issue; Other Outstanding Cases Can Be Negotiated at Any Time <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Tang Youren, Permanent Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, has been bedridden in Shanghai for nearly a month due to poisoning of his left middle finger. After treatment by Japanese doctor Yoshida, he has largely recovered. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency specially visited him at his residence on Ganstone Road yesterday and was granted an audience. According to him, his finger ailment has now largely recovered, but it will still take more than ten days for it to fully heal. However, as he is in charge of routine affairs, there are many matters that urgently need to be handled in Beijing. Therefore, he has now decided to return to Beijing by the end of this month to make some arrangements before returning to Shanghai for a short rest. Then, talking about Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the recent rumors circulating outside about direct Sino-Japanese negotiations are entirely a misunderstanding by the general public. Whether or not there are direct negotiations only refers to the Northeast issue. In the past, our country proposed that it be handled by the League of Nations because it did not want to negotiate directly with Japan. As for various other outstanding cases, there is always the possibility of negotiation at any time, regardless of whether it is direct or indirect. Later, when the reporter asked about Wang Yitang's trip to Japan, which was rumored to be for the restoration of the Huiye Bank, Tang replied that Wang's trip to Japan was entirely his personal action and he was not carrying any mission from the government. Because Wang is a Buddhist, he went to participate in a Buddhist conference. As for the Huiye Bank, its business has always been exclusively engaged in Sino-Japanese debt. However, our country cannot currently talk about repaying Japanese debt for the time being, so the bank has no way to recover at all.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Ji Zezin Discusses the Reasons for the Stagnant Sales of Chinese Tea; Commercial Decline and Heavy Dumping of Japanese Tea; We Must Strive to Recover by Improving the Quality of Our Tea <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>According to Ji Zezin, director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, who spoke yesterday about the reasons for the stagnant sales of Chinese tea in the Nanyang region and the crisis of the tea industry, he spoke in great detail. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e146">Decline of the Tea Market <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>According to his account, taking Singapore as an example, the Chinese tea industry used to be quite developed in the past. There were no fewer than forty or fifty to sixty or seventy tea merchants, large and small. However, in recent years, due to the economic downturn, the number has decreased to only twenty or thirty. The source of the tea is usually transported from Xiamen, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and other places, and most of it is picked and roasted from Anxi and Wuyi Mountains. The best quality teas include famous varieties such as Seczhong, Qizhong, Tieguanyin, and Baimao Hou, followed by varieties such as Shuixian, Wulong, and Xueli. Anxi County alone produces tea leaves every year that are sold in Chaozhou, Zhangzhou, Tong'an, Xiamen, Nanyang, and other places, amounting to about two million yuan in national currency every year. Anxi has recently been plagued by many bandits, and the people are struggling to survive, so the tea production in the area has declined abnormally. However, this has a great impact on foreign trade and people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Dumping of Taiwanese Tea <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the sales of Chinese tea in Malaya have gradually stagnated. Although the biggest reason is closely related to the global economic downturn, the competition from Taiwanese tea is the main reason. Taiwanese tea currently sells for only two, three, four, or five Straits dollars per box (one hundred packs, twenty-five catties each), while Chinese tea from Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Wenzhou must be above seven dollars. It is appropriate that Taiwanese tea wants to surpass Chinese tea. Japanese gold is currently extremely cheap. Although a box only sells for two, three, four, or five dollars in the Straits, it can earn four, five, seven, or eight dollars or more in Taiwan. Merchants who seek heavy profits, seeing the opportunity to profit, also abandon Chinese tea and replace it with Taiwanese tea. As a result, the future of Chinese tea is becoming increasingly bleak. Chinese tea has the harmony of the four seasons in China, and the tea leaves are picked around Qingming and Lixia, following the solar terms, so the aroma of Chinese tea is particularly good, different from that of other products. If the promotion is done properly, it may not be impossible to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Heavy Tea Taxes <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Another reason for the sluggish sales of Chinese tea is the tea tax levied by the Federated Malay States. It is necessary to pay eight cents per pound, and the tax on one box can reach more than two dollars and sixty cents. The same is true in the Dutch East Indies. Previously, the tax was only four guilders and eight cents per box, but now it is as much as six to eight or nine guilders. This increase in taxation is also a fatal blow to Chinese tea. In addition, during this time of economic downturn, tea merchants and shops have set up small carts along the streets to solicit customers in order to expand their business and maintain operations, which also shows the intensity of the competition.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Sharp Decline in Sales <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The total number of tea imports into Malaya in 1933 has not yet been printed and published. The statistics for 1932, 1931, and 1930 are listed below to give a glimpse:</p>
<p>Imports from China: Weight/Value</p>
<p>1930: 4,704,780 lbs / 1,556,760 dollars</p>
<p>1931: 5,510,601 lbs / 1,065,149 dollars</p>
<p>1932: 3,590,990 lbs / 689,743 dollars</p>
<p>In 1932, tea imports into Malaya from China, Ceylon, Taiwan, and other places totaled 4,971,654 pounds, worth 1,196,582 dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Further News on the Tianxiang Steamer Grounding and Sinking; Part of the Crew Can Arrive in Shanghai Today or Tomorrow; The Ship Has Not Completely Sunk and Six People Have Been Sent to Guard It <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Tianxiang Steamer of the Donggang Heji Company ran aground and sank on the morning of the 20th of this month near Nianzi Reef, near Beitongtou Mountain, off the coast of Wenzhou. Fortunately, the crew and passengers were all safely rescued and arrived in Ou. It is now heard that part of the crew will depart from Wenzhou to Shanghai. The following is the latest news obtained yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Crew Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>After the Tianxiang Steamer ran aground and sank on Nianzi Reef on the morning of the 20th due to thunderstorms, wind, and fog, the crew and passengers were rescued and arrived in Wen, temporarily housed in the Siming Guild Hall in the area as a reception center. The local Donggang Company received two telegrams the day before yesterday, but no telegram report yesterday. However, according to oral reports, part of the crew, led by the compradore Yang Zhiting, is taking a steamer from Wenzhou to Shanghai. If they take the Ping'an Company's Dahua Steamer, they can arrive this afternoon. If they take the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan Steamer, they can also arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. However, it is not certain which ship they are taking. As for the insurance company's compensation issue, it will be negotiated after the crew arrives in Shanghai and provides a detailed report.</p>
<h3 id="e152">People Sent to Guard <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The ship sank at Nianzi Reef, under Beitongtou Mountain. Therefore, after the accident, the crew and passengers left the ship and first went to the mountain, and then hired fishing boats to go to Wenzhou. The shipowner saw that the stern of the ship had sunk, and the bow was still stranded on the rocks. The pilothouse could still be seen when the tide was high, and the bow could be seen three feet above the water after the tide receded. Therefore, before leaving the mountain for Ou, six crew members were sent to guard it, awaiting company orders. However, how the company will deal with the sunken ship depends on the insurance company that underwrote it.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Settlement Measures <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Tianxiang Steamer of the Donggang Heji Company has 30,000 yuan of peace insurance underwritten by the Joint Shipping Insurance Association. After the grounding, the company immediately reported to the insurance company. Now the Insurance Association has decided to wait for the crew to arrive in Shanghai to report before deciding on settlement measures based on the extent of the grounding. It is likely that they will give up salvage because the insurance amount is only 30,000 yuan, and salvage and repair may not be cost-effective.</p>

<p>According to the Shishi News Agency, the China National Aviation Corporation's No. 17 aircraft has been missing for nearly a month. Yesterday, the company received a report that a body of a radio mechanic who was missing with the plane had been found in the waters off Zhejiang. This confirms that the people and the plane are all dead. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e155">Body Found <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Since the loss of the plane, the China National Aviation Corporation has been constantly inquiring about the personnel who were missing with the plane. At 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, they suddenly received a telegram from Chen Baolin, the magistrate of Cixi County, stating that at dusk on the 20th, Shen A-da, a fisherman from Gaobishan, Shenshi Bridge, Cixi North, discovered a Western body while fishing. The body had been dead for a long time and was swollen and rotten all over. Several business cards with the words "A.M. Carlson, American Pacific Airlines, No. 3 Guangdong Road, Shanghai" were found on the body. After receiving the telegram, the company believed that the body was undoubtedly that of the radio mechanic Carlson (A.M. Carlson). They immediately dispatched Ling Yang last night, carrying funds, to take the Xinningxing Steamer to Zhejiang to collect the body and transport it to Shanghai. Carlson had only arrived in Shanghai two months before the loss of the plane. He was 30 years old and not yet married, so there are no family members in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Notification to the United States <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The American pilot Garcia de la Torre and Carlson, who died on the No. 17 aircraft, had life insurance with a certain insurance company in the United States. Since the accident, the families of the three had requested telegrams to the United States proving their deaths so that they could receive the insurance amount. The Ministry had not replied immediately because the whereabouts of the pilot had not yet been found. The discovery of Carlson's body this time can definitively prove that the other crew members have also undoubtedly sunk into the sea. Therefore, after receiving a detailed report from the China National Aviation Corporation, it will send a telegram to the United States to formally prove that the pilots and others have indeed died in the plane crash. At the same time, the families of the deceased will be notified.</p>

<p>Temporary Permission for First Mates to Serve as Captains on Ships Under 1,000 Tons; Shipping Guilds and Other Organizations Will Petition in Beijing Again; After the Ministry of Communications issued an order forbidding ship personnel from serving beyond their ranks, stipulating ship tonnage standards, implementing examination and verification for qualification, and setting a deadline of the end of June this year, otherwise their duties would be suspended, various shipping companies and shipping organizations in the city requested temporary flexibility from the Shipping Administration Bureau yesterday due to difficulties in handling. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e161">Standards for Ship Personnel Service <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the standards for ship personnel service for Chinese and foreign shipping companies, it is stipulated according to ship tonnage, divided into ocean routes, coastal routes, and inland river routes. Ships with a tonnage of more than 1,000 tons should have one captain, first mate, second mate, and chief engineer, etc. Ships with a tonnage of more than 500 tons and less than 1,000 tons should follow the same as above. However, shipping companies often hire qualified and experienced ship personnel as captains on ships with a tonnage of more than 1,000 tons, and the positions of the original first mate, second mate, and chief engineer are also uneven. The Ministry of Communications believes that this system has a great impact on the shipping industry, so it stipulates tonnage standards to prevent abuses and ensure safety.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Joint Request for Flexibility <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. tomorrow, representatives from the Shanghai Shipping Guild, the Marine Engineers General Guild, the Sanbei Company, the Dada Steamship Company, and other organizations will meet with Peng Hu, director of the Shipping Administration Bureau, to request flexibility in the standards for ship service before the deadline. Director Peng replied that the matter concerned orders from above and there was no room for flexibility. However, to take into account the difficulties of the shipping merchants, he replied to the representatives that ship personnel on ships with a tonnage of more than 1,000 tons should be handled according to the standards and should not serve beyond their ranks. On ships with a tonnage of more than 500 tons and less than 1,000 tons, first mates will be temporarily allowed to serve as captains, and second mates will be promoted to first mates before the deadline. Other chief engineers, etc., will also be appointed accordingly, as an expedient compromise. It is also heard that shipping guilds and other organizations will send representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Communications in the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Land Prices on West Yuhua Road Soar <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>North Sichuan Road has been known as the second Nanjing Road, because it is close to the central area and all kinds of conveniences are available. West Yuhua Road, which borders it to the north, is only four miles away from Nanjing Road and the Bund, which is closer than Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road in western Shanghai. Moreover, the width of the road, the quiet scenery, and the fresh air are better than those of Yuyuan Road and other places. In addition, water, electricity, and public utilities are all available, public buses run all day long, and transportation is extremely convenient. The residents nearby are either villas or public officials, teachers, students, and farmers, so it is very suitable for building houses and settling down. Before January 28th, the land price rose to 5,000 or 6,000 taels per mu. After the Shanghai Incident, the price once fell, but there were few sellers and transactions stagnated. Since the municipal government moved to the downtown area, land transactions in the area have become active. Recently, because Xinhua Bank has opened Xinhua Village in the middle of the road, it is heard that many wealthy businessmen and financial circles are building houses and settling down in the area, or buying large amounts of land to carry out similar plans. Therefore, land prices have soared, and there is a trend to restore the prices before January 28th. Recently, the land price has reached 4,500 taels to 5,000 taels per mu.</p>

<p>Zhou Songqian and others, shareholders of the Chinese Light Bulb Factory on Xinzha Road in this city, sued Tong Zhihe and others in the Criminal Division of the Shanghai First Special District Court for embezzlement and breach of trust, alleging that Tong Zhihe and others had committed embezzlement and breach of trust. The plaintiffs stated that in October of the 21st year, they and the defendants jointly organized the Chinese Light Bulb Factory, appointing Tong Zhihe as manager and Sheng Henian as assistant manager. Since its opening, it has been quite successful. However, the defendants, intending to embezzle, colluded with shareholder Yu Yinda and others, and on March 7th of this year, Sheng Henian, Yu Yinda, and others issued a written document transferring the Chinese Light Bulb Factory, which the plaintiffs had invested in, to Tong Zhihe for continued operation, and all the shares held by the plaintiffs in the factory were discarded as waste paper. The defendants are representatives of the British American Tobacco factory workers.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Yesterday They Petitioned Party and Government Agencies; Today, Representatives of Two Factories Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss the Formation of a Strike Committee <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, all the workers of the new British American Tobacco Company factory in Pudong, in order to help the unemployed workers of the old factory, declared a work stoppage a few days ago to urge the factory to realize the situation. The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, considering that the labor unrest might be difficult to resolve and to avoid the expansion of disputes, yesterday sent representatives to petition the party and government separately, and decided to hold a workers' representative meeting of the two factories today to discuss the formation of a strike committee. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Petitioning Party and Government) In order to seek the prompt resumption of work at the old British American Tobacco factory, the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union specially sent Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, and 37 others as representatives to petition the party and government agencies at 9:00 AM yesterday, first going to the Municipal Government, where Secretary-General Yu received them. After the labor representatives explained the situation in detail, Yu negotiated with the British American Tobacco Company. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, where Secretary Li received them and gave a similar reply. Finally, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition, where Committee Member Wu Kaixian received them. The labor representatives demanded that the Party Headquarters uphold justice and quickly find a solution to avoid the expansion of disputes. Wu promised to consult with the Municipal Government and then determine a solution, but hoped that the workers would fight in an orderly manner to avoid causing other disputes. They all left after 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>(Appealing for Assistance) In addition to sending representatives to petition, the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union also submitted a petition to the party and government for assistance. The original petition stated: "Submitted for the matter of petitioning. The British American Tobacco Company suddenly closed the first factory in Pudong on the 12th of this month without reason, and more than 3,000 workers in the entire factory were suddenly plunged into despair. It is unbearable to speak of the sadness and fear. Looking back, the first factory has been in operation for more than 30 years and is the ancestor of the company's factories in China, earning profits of no less than tens of millions, all of which are the crystallization of our workers' blood and sweat. In recent years, the company's management has been unable to unify, often causing disputes. The workers are deeply aware that the country is in a difficult situation and have made concessions step by step, but the company has taken advantage of the opportunity to gain an inch. In the middle of last month, the factory used the excuse of sluggish business to continuously reduce work. After the Municipal Government's approval number 30 ordered compliance, the factory was not allowed to reduce working hours without submitting a request to the主管官署 for approval. Unexpectedly, the factory refused to comply. On the 10th of this month, it again arbitrarily reduced the working hours, only doing 36 hours per week. The union believed that it was difficult to maintain the workers' livelihood and petitioned the party and government agencies. We also received the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's approval number 3614, ordering the factory to postpone implementation temporarily in order to provide some security for the lives of 7,000 workers. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of this month, the company regarded the orders of the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau as worthless, using the excuse of sluggish business and refusing to follow orders, and actually closed the old factory, plunging more than 3,000 workers in the entire factory into despair and causing panic in the society. The previous reduction in work was due to the use of new high-speed machines to increase speed, and the outsourcing of raw material rolling to factories such as Citibank, resulting in overproduction, which has nothing to do with sluggish business. The closure of the first factory this time is because some workers have been working for two or three years and their wages are all above one or two yuan. The intention is to lay off old workers and save wages, and then hire new workers when the factory resumes operation in the future. If this example is set, not only will British American Tobacco's factories in China follow suit, but other factories will also follow suit, affecting the future of workers across the country, which is no small matter. In this crisis, our hearts are filled with anxiety. We are sending another group of 39 representatives, including Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, and Zhang Ziping, to come forward to petition and present everything in person, hoping that you will provide a solution for us to follow."</p>
<p>(Forming a Strike Committee) In order to seek the immediate resumption of work at the old British American Tobacco Company factory, the workers of the new and old factories resolved at the representatives' meeting the day before yesterday to organize a factory resumption movement committee, and decided that if there was still no solution before Thursday of this week, it would be changed to a strike committee. Now that the deadline is approaching and the factory still has no hope of resuming work, the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union decided to hold a workers' representative meeting at the Lannidu clubhouse at 5:00 PM today to discuss the formation of a strike committee.</p>
<p>As the assistant manager, he disregarded the legal interests of the plaintiffs' shareholders, intending to illegally possess the factory invested in by the plaintiffs that he managed for himself or a third party, and for the benefit of himself or a third party in handling the plaintiffs' affairs, he engaged in an illegal transfer that violated his duties. This is a crime in violation of Articles 357 and 366 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the complaint and opened the trial yesterday. After the plaintiff stated the intention of the lawsuit, the defendant denied everything. The court immediately ordered the start of the debate and announced the conclusion of the trial, scheduling sentencing for the 26th of this month.</p>

<p>Yi Xiangshan, a native of Hubei, recently acquired a strange child. The child has two heads at both ends, with four hands and three feet. The lower part is fused together, resembling twins who have not been fully developed and separated. It has been a year since it was born, and it is fed with milk. Its crying and laughing are no different from ordinary children, except that sometimes one head is asleep while the other is still awake. A few days ago, Yi brought the strange child to the home of a relative, Liu Shunfa Rice Shop, at No. 14 Wujianong, Pudong, for a temporary stay. Unexpectedly, nearby residents, who had never heard of a two-headed child, could not help but regard it as a strange thing and flocked to the rice shop to watch. Yi, seeing that it was a rare commodity, stayed at the Pudong Hospital to avoid the crowds. The Yangjing District Tongcai Charity Association learned of the matter and, with Yi's consent, began selling tickets for public viewing in a building at a certain number on Dongchang Road yesterday. The proceeds from the tickets were used to fund the association. The audience was quite crowded.</p>

They are bright and dazzling, and extremely beautiful. The price is also lower than in previous years. As the summer season approaches, orders for fans from various places are pouring in, and the factory is overwhelmed.</p>

<p>According to Datong News Agency, the day before yesterday evening, a kind of anonymous mailed letter was found in this city. After carefully checking the postmark of the mailing location on the envelope, it belonged to Nanjing. The letter revealed that some Buddhists were preparing to participate in the Second Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Conference in Tokyo. Datong News Agency reporters, considering that the matter concerned the national system, specially explored the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Opening Statement of the Anonymous Letter <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the anonymous letter said: "In late July of this year, the Japan Buddhist Youth League will hold the Second Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Conference in Tokyo. The countries it invites openly lists the pseudo-state of Manchuria as the second and China as the third. Also, its organizing staff lists Fujii Sousen, the head of the Chinese team, and Kobayashi Keizen, the head of the Manchurian team, insulting our country in every possible way. Any Chinese with a bit of blood should be angry and resentful. However, on the 8th of this month, the Chugai Nippo, published in Kyoto, Japan, reported that Fujii, the head of the Chinese team, reported that more than a dozen Buddhist monks in our country had been persuaded by him, claiming to be representatives, and decided to attend the conference."</p>
<h3 id="e182">The List Is Clear and the Words Are Evident <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The following is a list of the names of those who have decided to attend the conference, which seems to be based on evidence. The list is as follows: Chang Xing (Fujian Minnan Buddhist Academy), Cai Qicheng (Fujian Buddhist Youth Association), Yu Yu (Fujian), Hui Quan (Fujian), Tan Xuan (Wuchang World Buddhist Academy Library), Deng Xia (Nanjing World Buddhist Academy General Academy Preparatory Office), Ji Ying (same as above), Zhifeng (Hangzhou Yanqing Temple), Hui Lu (same as above), Wu Kai (same as above), Hui Song (Hangzhou Zhaoxian Temple).</p>
<h3 id="e183">Some of the Representatives Are Also from Shanghai <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>It is also said that there are also Gao Jiyun (Shanghai) and Chao Yi (Sichuan) who intend to go as representatives. The report also stated that Chang Xing has arrived in Shanghai and is in contact with the Chinese Buddhist Association. In the future, the representative group will probably be chaired by Chang Xing. Below, the person who sent the anonymous letter expressed his feelings, saying, "The Buddhist community in our country has always lacked unity, so that a small number of degenerates have taken the place of representatives and acted recklessly, which has become commonplace. However, this time Japan is holding a conference, including the pseudo-state puppet on one side and enticing monks from our country to attend on the other, trying to make our country have relations with the puppet, their intentions are sinister and unspeakable. However, Chang Xing and others are ignorant of the big picture, recklessly participating, and wanting to associate with representatives of the pseudo-state that the world does not recognize, humiliating themselves and the country, there is nothing more serious than this. I hope that the people of our country will unanimously find ways to stop it, which is the fortune of the country's future."</p>

<p>After receiving the news, the Datong News Agency reporter went to the Chinese Buddhist Association on Avenue Edward VII and Hart Road yesterday morning to inquire. According to Secretary Xu Guangrong, the association also received the letter yesterday and was very surprised. It has now been decided to convene a National Buddhist Representatives Conference on the morning of the 10th of next month to discuss the matter and investigate the truth.</p>

<p>The following is an exploration of Chang Xing's experience: Shi Chang Xing, a native of Hebei, is a disciple of Master Taixu. He is currently a member of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Dean of Xiamen Buddhist Academy, and Abbot of Changzhou Guangxiao Temple.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Apprentice Dies Suddenly, Suspect; Proven to Be Caused by Arsenic Poisoning; Judge Orders Autopsy <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Senchang Jewelry Store at No. 136 Peng Road is opened by Li Wanchang from Wuxi. The business is quite good, employing eight or nine partners and apprentices. One of the apprentices, Qi Zhugen, a native of Shaoxing, is seventeen years old and has been apprenticed at the store for only two months. Around 7:00 PM the night before last, Qi went out to urinate. After finishing, he returned to the store. Li and others suddenly saw his hands and feet shaking violently, so they immediately sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He soon died. The hospital reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered Detective Jin Guanya to investigate. The body was then taken to the Philen Road autopsy site. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was reported, and Prosecutor Diao Chengtang, together with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., arrived at the site to examine the body. He then took the stand and announced the case. First, the Western police chief reported that there was a medical certificate here stating that the deceased died from brain damage or arsenic poisoning. Arsenic is a chemical substance that is also available in the store for cleaning silver utensils. However, according to the investigation, the arsenic is placed on the second floor of the store, and the apprentices also know that it is poisonous. The medical certificate was submitted for inspection. Li Wanchang, 45 years old, said that the store was founded by him. Around 7:00 PM that night, after we finished dinner, the deceased went out to urinate. Unexpectedly, he came back in a moment, and his hands and feet suddenly trembled. He was immediately sent to the hospital and there was no quarrel. Tao Zifeng, 31 years old, who is a partner in the store, testified that the store owner did not quarrel with the deceased. He also submitted the previous information. Qi Chengshan, 43 years old, a native of Guixing, said that the deceased was his son. At that time, he did not know. After going to the hospital to see, he had already died. He should be thoroughly examined. After hearing the statements, Diao ordered that the body of the deceased Qi Zhugen be dissected and examined, and the body was handed over to his father, Qi Chengshan, to receive the coffin and bury it.</p>

<p>Zhou Yu'exuan, the eldest son of Zhou Weisheng, the owner of Zhou Gengji Yarn Shop who once served as the president of the Suzhou Association in Shanghai, freely fell in love with Zhang Zhuying in the past and formed a small family. Soon a son was born, named Dayuan. Unexpectedly, Weisheng found out and ordered his son's small family to be dissolved, causing Yu'exuan and Zhuying to go their separate ways. The child was raised by Zhuying, and the necessary living expenses were provided by Yu'exuan. Until last autumn, Yu'exuan suddenly stopped paying the living expenses, causing Dayuan to face starvation. Therefore, Zhang Zhuying sued Yu'exuan for abandonment on behalf of her son in the First Special District Court. After the trial was concluded, the defendant was found not guilty, as reported in this newspaper. However, Zhang Zhuying was very unwilling to accept the verdict and vowed that Dayuan was indeed born to her and Zhou Yu'exuan. On this point, even if it cannot be positively proven, it is only necessary to carefully examine Dayuan's lips and eyes, which are very similar to Zhou Yu'exuan, with almost no difference. Unexpectedly, she still lost the lawsuit, making Dayuan a fatherless child. She was extremely heartbroken, so she continued to hire lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Luo Jiaheng, and Xiang Xun to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, listing the reasons and requesting a reversal. Yesterday, Judge Yu opened the court for trial, and both the plaintiff and defendant, as well as Dayuan, were present. First, Zhang Zhuying stated the course of her separation and reunion with the defendant, and then Zhou Yu'exuan defended himself. The testimonies of both parties were roughly similar to those stated in the first instance. Judge Yu ordered a postponement of the hearing because he still needed to summon witnesses to investigate the facts.</p>

<p>Cen Dazhi, a student at Chizhi University, a native of Guangxi, 23 years old, living at No. 17 Datongli, Seymour Road, is the fourth son of Cen Chunxuan, the former Governor-General of Liangguang in the Qing Dynasty. Recently, Wu Fusheng, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 17 Qingdao Road, and his daughter Wu Xiubao (also known as Amao, 17 years old), hired lawyer Huang Xiubo and filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing him of abducting a woman under the age of 20 and abortion, and requesting that he be punished according to Article 257, Paragraph 1, and Article 307, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Wu Xiubao</p>
<h3 id="e189">Is a Dancer by Profession <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>She used to dance in various dance halls such as Dahua, Dashu, and Vienna. Three years ago, when Xiubao was a dancer in Dahua, she met Cen Kui, who often went to the dance hall to dance. At that time, Cen had a good feeling for Xiubao, and then seduced her with sweet words, promising to marry her in the future, causing Xiubao to be seduced by Cen to various hotels, such as the Dongya and China Hotels, and had sexual relations. Cen wrote a note,</p>
<h3 id="e190">Willing to Marry Her <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Recently, half a year ago, they continued to have sexual relations in Room 21 of Anlegong. As a result, Xiubao became pregnant and is now five months pregnant. However, Cen recently changed his mind and stopped contacting her. On the morning of April 4th of this year, Cen Dazhi's elder brother, Cen Lao San, brought an abortion drug to Wu's house and forced Xiubao to have an abortion, and snatched the note written by Cen Dazhi. Xiubao at the time</p>
<h3 id="e191">Refused to Have an Abortion <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Lao San took the note and left. However, her father, Wu Fusheng, did not know about Xiubao's illicit behavior with Cen Dazhi. After this move, he questioned Xiubao and finally learned the whole story, leading to the lawsuit. The court approved the complaint. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the Second Criminal Court for trial. The defendant Cen Dazhi did not appear. His mother, Cen Jiang, entrusted two lawyers, Peng and Zhang, to appear in court, saying that the defendant was currently in Suzhou and could not surrender. He requested a postponement. After Judge Liu briefly questioned the plaintiff, he ordered a postponement of the hearing to a later date.</p>

Recently, because the Wu surname sold the property to the Lin surname from Beiping, it was rebuilt into a three-story steel-concrete residential building, which was contracted by Qiasun Construction Factory. There was a contract with a deadline for completion. Therefore, ditching and pile driving have been underway in recent days to make three-in-one soil foundations. Because the neighboring Lu surname's lean-to was not supported beforehand, the foundation of the wall shook and collapsed. One or two lean-tos were destroyed. Fortunately, it was daytime and no one was injured. The injured Lu surname owner reported it to the responsible public security bureau of the first sub-district, who sent personnel to the scene to investigate. It was found that the Qiasun Construction Factory had reduced the work in various ways, which caused the collapse. Moreover, there were several ancient tombs underground, all built of brick corridors, which were extremely strong. Two of the ancient tombs happened to be located at the ditching and pile driving site and had been opened. However, the coffins had rotted, leaving only skeletons. The skeletons were bright red in color. Because there was water in the corridor, they were all picked up from the water. There were also small items such as ancient coins and jade objects, which were all hidden by the workers. Although the tomb had brick boards, they had been broken and the inscriptions were difficult to identify. It is not known whose family tomb it is, and no one has claimed the bones. There are still two tombs left underground, which have not been excavated or reburied. It is said that the Lu surname is now demanding that work be stopped pending resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Tragic Murder Case Beside Zhaofeng Garden: Immoral Woman with Other Desires Plots with New Lover to Kill Old Flame <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Around 11 PM the night before last, a love triangle murder case occurred beside the small stone bridge near Zhaofeng Garden, next to the Shanghai West Caojiadu Extra-Settlement Road YMCA. The deceased was named Qiang Fugen. The adulterous lover and the female lead have both fled without a trace. The detailed circumstances are investigated and recorded below:</p>
<p>(Shouts for Help Resound) At 11 PM the night before last, Gao Shanxian, a policeman from the Sixth District of Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road, received a report from a Wang surname resident of the YMCA compound, stating that a man had been assassinated near the small stone bridge and was lying on the ground. Two Western men and women happened to pass by, heard the sound, and caught a glimpse, instructing the resident to report the incident. The policeman immediately went to the location and found blood everywhere, indicating severe injuries. He hired a car to take the injured man back to the district.</p>
<p>(Death Due to Severe Injuries) The injured man was still conscious when he arrived at the district. After being questioned by District Chief Tan and District Officer Xing, he was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. Doctors found a knife wound about two to three inches deep in his waist and abdomen. His internal organs were damaged, and he lost too much blood. Despite emergency surgery, his injuries were too severe, and he died at 0:50 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>(Love Quadrangle) According to the deceased's statement, his name was Qiang Fugen, 30 years old, from Wuxi, currently residing at No. 3 Yikang Lane, Huajin Lane, Sanma Road, Public Concession. He had no family in Shanghai. He used to work as a clerk at the Shanghai Telephone Company and later as a cashier at a dance hall. He became unemployed in January of this year. Four years ago, he became acquainted with Mrs. Lu Wang, the wife of Lu Zixi (also known as Lu Yizhang), residing at No. 1 Tongqing Lane, Minguo Road. They were deeply in love and often met secretly in hotels. Unexpectedly, in January of this year, the woman became secretly involved with Zhang Hanzhang, who runs a butcher shop at No. 6 Huikang Lane, Caojiadu, Shanghai West. She became tired of the old and favored the new, developing a dislike for Qiang and colluding with Zhang to plot his murder.</p>
<p>(Luring for Murder) The day before yesterday afternoon, the woman tricked Qiang to Shanghai West, feigning intimacy. They went to Zhaofeng Garden to play. Around 10 PM, they left the garden and walked to the small stone bridge at Sujiajiao. Unexpectedly, her new lover, Zhang Hanzhang, had been lying in wait there. Seeing Qiang approaching, he grabbed him and pulled out a sharp dagger from his waist, stabbing Qiang violently in the right abdomen three times. Qiang fell to the ground in extreme pain. Zhang and the woman, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled out of the alley, each hiring a rickshaw for two small silver coins to get to Wujiaochang, where they got off and hired a Haining Company car to escape Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Separate Investigations) The rickshaw puller, seeing that the man and woman looked panicked and suspicious, reported to the local police post. When the police arrived after receiving the report, the car had already gone far away. The police took the rickshaw puller, named Ju Jinhui, to the district. District Chief Tan immediately dispatched Patrol Officer Cheng, along with Detective Team Leader Wu Kezhong, Detectives Yang Qing, Wang Yixin, etc., to No. 1 Tongqing Lane, Minguo Road, to arrest Lu Zixi, the female lead's husband, and bring him back to the district. Patrol Officer Long was also dispatched with bailiffs to No. 6 Huikang Lane to arrest Zhang Hanzhang's wife, Mrs. Zhang Wang (32 years old), and concubine, Zhang Cai (22 years old), and bring them to the district as well.</p>
<p>(Seizing the Murder Weapon) Yesterday morning, Patrol Officers Cheng and Long went to the scene of the incident to investigate. They found a sharp knife about eight to nine inches long in the nearby grass. After bringing it back to the district, they ordered the local Baotou to report it to the local court for examination. Subsequently, the court appointed a prosecutor to inspect the scene and confirm that the deceased had been fatally stabbed. The Baotou was instructed to prepare a coffin for burial. District Chief Tan then questioned Lu Zixi, Mrs. Zhang Wang, and Zhang Cai separately, deciding to temporarily detain them pending further investigation. The rickshaw puller was released.</p>

<p>Lu Jinbao (also known as Yun Lun Jiting), the owner of Lu Linji Automobile Shop on Kunming Road, from Taizhou, committed a series of kidnappings between February and December of the 21st year of the Republic of China, including Tian Wuxing, Sheng Yishao, and Le Zhenbao, the owner of Taichang Wood Shop, demanding huge ransoms. He fled after the incidents, and his whereabouts were unknown. Eventually, Chief Detective You A'gen and Detective Liu Junqing of the Zhabei Police Station arrested Lu on Aiduya Road. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station filed a public prosecution according to law. After the Special Court No. 1 concluded its interrogation, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court yesterday morning and announced the judgment: Lu Jinbao was found guilty of kidnapping for ransom and sentenced to death.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Four Gangs Open Eight or Nine Gambling Dens, Multiple Raids Fail, Finally Busted on Tangshan Road – Police Tea Server Joins in Gambling – <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Wu Genyuan, Superintendent of Section D of the Public Concession Police, along with Sun Baoshan and Gu Junxian of the Huishan Police Station, recently received a tip that Bao Kaiyi, Chen Longji (nicknamed Yellow Croaker Head), Mao Fu, Rui Kang, and others, all well-known Shanghai East gangsters and leaders of four gangs, had recently opened gambling dens in the Huishan area, enticing respectable women to gamble and taking commissions. The stakes were very high, and they were requested to investigate. The two detectives secretly investigated for about ten days and learned that their organization was very tight and that the gambling dens, as many as eight or nine, such as those on Xihuade Road, Puqing Lane, Longqing Lane, Xingqing Lane, etc., were constantly moving, making it difficult to catch them. They had applied to Special Court No. 1 for search warrants seven times, but because they were well-informed, they had failed to crack the case. However, the night before last, they learned that the gambling den had moved to No. 31 Houde Lane, Tangshan Road. They immediately applied to Special Court No. 1 for a search warrant. At 10:15 PM, Detectives Sun and Gu led Chinese and foreign detectives, disguised, to the location and finally cracked the case. They arrested Bao and Chen but failed to catch Mao Fu and Rui Kang, who were not present. They also arrested 28 male gamblers and 9 female gamblers, seizing two sets of Pai Gow, two sets of Mahjong, and gambling chips. They were all taken back to the police station. However, one of the 28 men, Liu Juzi, was a tea server from the detective office of the Huishan Police Station. It was unknown how, but he escaped midway. After the arrest of Bao and Chen, many people called the police station requesting bail, but Superintendent Wu refused. The suspects were then detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of Special Court No. 1. Attorney Jiang Bao of the police station requested that they be severely punished according to the law and that an arrest warrant be issued for Liu Juzi. Two of the gamblers, Shen Baolin and Xu Xinde, were suspected of other criminal offenses, and it was requested that their cases be postponed. Judge Wu Xiangzu questioned each of the defendants one by one, severely punishing and fining them. The gambling equipment was confiscated.</p>

<p>Chen Zhongxing, a Cantonese overseas Chinese residing in the upstairs of No. 2 Wufeng Lane at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Luban Road in the French Concession, was previously friendly with his fellow townsman Tan Lengyu. Tan stole more than 3,000 yuan in foreign currency from Chen in early winter of last year. Chen discovered the theft, reported it to the police, and Tan was detained and sentenced to four months in prison by the court. Tan harbored a grudge because of this and conceived the idea of killing Chen. After being released from prison in early spring of this year, he invited Qian Qichang, a Zhenjiang native and fellow inmate, to rent the main hall upstairs at No. 28 Baoren Lane, Xiafei Road. On the morning of March 27, at about 8 AM, Tan lured Chen to No. 28 Baoren Lane, first ordering him to play chess with Chen to pass the time. At about 1 PM, Tan made his move to kill Chen, hitting him on the head with a cloth-wrapped iron hammer, causing him to be injured and die instantly. Qian fled first. Tan then wrapped the body in bedding and clothes, sprinkled kerosene on it, and set it on fire, attempting to destroy the body and eliminate evidence. After setting the fire, he calmly escaped. The fire was later discovered by the second landlord, the Russian Yuri Aivov, who reported it to the fire department. After the fire was extinguished, Chen's body was discovered. The police took the body to the mortuary for examination and reported it to the court for investigation. The family of the deceased claimed the body for burial while the police investigated the suspects. Detective Superintendent Jin Jiulin of the French Concession Police learned that the accomplice Qian Qichang had fled back to his hometown in Zhenjiang. He rushed there on April 5, arrested Qian, and brought him to Shanghai. Qian confessed that the main culprit, Tan Lengyu, had fled to Guangzhou. Qian was sent to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. Detective Superintendent Jin and others rushed to Guangzhou to arrest Tan, but were unsuccessful. The details of Qian's trial have been reported previously. The court appointed a pro bono lawyer to defend Qian, and the trial concluded. Yesterday morning, on the date of sentencing, the police brought Qian to the court. At 10:30 AM, Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Qian Qichang to fourteen years of imprisonment for assisting in premeditated murder. The number of days of pre-trial detention was converted to imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. During the appeal period, he will be detained in the detention center pending further instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Galileo's Experiments and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>Recently, I have been at home away from school and studying all subjects on my own, so I always encounter difficulties! I was reading physics and had questions that left me full of doubts. I was delighted to learn that your newspaper has a reading guidance column to answer readers' questions, so I am writing to ask for help with the following pressing questions: All students of physics are familiar with Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. My questions arise from these. According to Galileo's experiment, when objects are not hindered by air resistance, they fall freely from the same height at the same time and reach the ground at the same time, regardless of their size or weight. Newton's Law states that the gravitational force between objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses. It seems that these two principles are contradictory. I would like to present a few points for discussion. I do not dare to question the wisdom of the ancients, but I am genuinely puzzled.</p>
<p>1. According to Galileo, objects fall at the same speed if they are not resisted or subject to friction. This is true in terms of area and speed, but with mass, it seems to contradict Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that "the magnitude of the gravitational force is directly proportional to the mass…"</p>
<p>2. Suppose that objects in a vacuum have nothing to do with gravity and are not affected by the earth's gravity. If this is true, then objects in a vacuum cannot move and should remain stationary in space because energy cannot be created. Since they are not subject to any gravitational or motive force, how can they move and fall? Therefore, this principle cannot be true.</p>
<p>3. If it is said that the molecules that make up an object are constantly in motion rather than static, so energy already exists in the object and does not need to be supplied. The reason why objects are usually still is because of the earth's gravity. Once the constraints from all sides are released, the potential energy will be manifested as motion. However, if the object is not subject to the influence of gravity and moves by the potential energy of the molecules, then its direction of motion is not fixed. Why, as in Galileo's vacuum experiment, is there only downward motion, and no motion upward, to the left, or to the right? The fact that it still has a tendency to move toward the earth is clear proof that it is still related to the earth's gravity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that the theories of the two masters are contradictory. However, I have little knowledge and cannot determine what is wrong. I lack the means of explanation and have no equipment for practical research. But I am consumed by a desire for knowledge, so I boldly ask</p>
<p>Your esteemed selves to provide me with an antidote to my doubts. I would be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>(Letter from Qu Qihuai, Yuanling)</p>
<p>"If there is no air resistance, objects of different masses must fall at the same acceleration." This law was discovered by Galileo and completely proven by Newton and Bessel. We can use the Law of Universal Gravitation to prove this law, which shows that these two laws are not mutually contradictory. According to the Law of Universal Gravitation: The gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. That is:</p>
<p>E = Gmm/r^2 (C is the gravitational constant)</p>
<p>Now suppose there are three objects with masses m1, m2, and m3.</p>
<p>These three objects are in the same place in the air, at an equal distance r from the earth. Suppose the mass of the earth is M, then the gravitational force between these three objects and the earth must be:</p>
<p>FI = GMmI/r^2 F-2 = G-Mm2 F3 = GMm3/r^2</p>
<p>According to Newton's Second Law: Force is the product of mass and acceleration. It can be deduced that:</p>
<p>A (Acceleration) = F (Force)/m (Mass)</p>
<p>Then the acceleration of the above three objects should be:</p>
<p>AI=EI/mIGMI2A2=F2m2GM-2</p>
<p>A3 = F3-Am3 = GM-r3</p>
<p>That is: AI = A2 = 3 = G I-r2</p>
<p>It is proven that: objects fall freely from the same place in the air at the same time. If there is no air or other resistance, they must fall to the ground at the same time, regardless of the mass of the objects.</p>
<p>(Another proof) We already know: force is the product of mass and acceleration, that is, F = ma.</p>
<p>Then: FI = mia.</p>
<p>Already know: FI = GMmI-r2</p>
<p>Then: mTa = GMmI-r2</p>
<p>That is a = GM-r2</p>
<p>Using the same method to calculate F2 and F3, the same result is obtained.</p>
<p>If you can understand these proofs, your first question will be resolved, and your second and third questions will be answered without question.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Record of the Husband's Murder of His Wife's Lover: The Wife's Lover Dares to Continue Their Affair After They Relocate, The Husband Witnesses It and Becomes Enraged, Leading to Murder <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>At around 9 AM the day before yesterday, a case of a husband stabbing his wife's lover and injuring his wife occurred at No. 49 Yongji Lane, Xinzha Road. The circumstances have been briefly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the deceased was named Gao Yihe, a native of Taizhou, 21 years old, who was working as a chef at a restaurant at No. 259 Wuding Road. Because of his affair with the woman Qin Yu, he was discovered by her husband, Qin A'fa, which led to this tragic murder case of jealousy and adultery. After the Xinzha Police Station heard the report, it immediately ordered Chinese Detective Yao Yuanlong, Detective Yang Feizhang, and Baotou Wang Pingsen to investigate. They arrested the murderer Qin A'fa, along with</p>
<h3 id="e201">a sharp blade <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>and brought them to the police station for detention. Qin Yu was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. It is said that her injuries were quite serious. Gao Yihe was sent to Baolong Hospital but died on the way due to his serious injuries and excessive blood loss. His body was transferred to the Fei Lun Road Mortuary to await examination. Yesterday morning, the police first sent Qin A'fa to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Attorney Gan Jingxian of the police station presented the case, stating that according to Article 282 of the Criminal Law, the defendant was charged with murder. However, the victim Gao Yihe had not yet been examined by the prosecutor, so it was requested that the case be postponed. Detective Yang Peizhang also reported</p>
<h3 id="e202">investigative circumstances <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>stating that the deceased Gao Yihe died in the kitchen downstairs, while Qin Yu was upstairs, both injured in the legs. When questioned, the defendant Qin A'fa confessed that he was a native of Wuxi, 29 years old, and Qin Yu was his wife. He did not know the deceased. He used to live in the front building of a restaurant at No. 259 Wuding Road and was a driver for the Xiangsheng Automobile Company on Beijing Road. The deceased was a cook at the restaurant, so they knew each other. When he was working at Xiangsheng Company, he heard rumors that the deceased was having</p>
<h3 id="e203">an affair <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>with his wife, but he had no proof. So he often took time to investigate secretly. He was caught twice. Once he saw the deceased playing mahjong upstairs, and his wife was sitting on his leg, very close, looking very intimate. Another time, he saw them talking secretly in the room, so he had doubts in his heart. His parents-in-law came to Shanghai from their hometown and lived with him. They also saw through the secret and told him to move quickly, otherwise they would not be responsible if something happened in the future. So he took his parents-in-law out to look for a house for several days in order to</p>
<h3 id="e204">cut off their desires <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>He also asked the company for three days of leave. He found a spare house at No. 49 Yongji Lane, Xinzha Road, and moved in the day before yesterday. Yesterday, his mother-in-law and others wanted to return to their hometown, so he sent his mother-in-law to the station in the morning. After getting on the train, he went home. He wanted to find his uniform and hat in the company's box to prepare for work. Suddenly, he found a photo of his wife in the box. He asked Yu because she usually didn't have photos, and even if she took photos, there should be two. Where did the other one go? She couldn't answer, and then claimed that she had given it to a young sister, and</p>
<h3 id="e205">roared loudly at me <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>deliberately provoking a quarrel. He didn't want to argue with her, so he left in anger and went to the company to do business. But he thought that Yu was already restless and usually spent 70 to 80 yuan of his hard-earned wages at will, with unknown purposes. He was very angry and had no intention of doing business, so he continued to take two days of leave from the company and went home immediately. Unexpectedly, when he entered the door, he saw his wife and Gao lying on the bed, talking intimately. He couldn't help but feel angry and loudly asked Gao why he had come again. Because he was afraid of him, he moved here. As he spoke, he slapped his wife twice. Gao, seeing his lover being humiliated, looked around and</p>
<h3 id="e206">took a pig-killing knife <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>from the door, intending to strike. At this time, he was outnumbered and afraid of danger. If he didn't take precautions, he would be harmed. So he bravely stepped forward, snatched the knife, and seeing his wife willing to be cheap, he stabbed his wife's leg with the knife. The deceased Gao Yihe stepped forward to help and wanted to snatch the kitchen knife back, accidentally injuring his left leg fatally. Qin also hired Attorney Chen Tingrui to defend him. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered the defendant Qin A'fa to be remanded in custody and adjourned for seven days for another hearing. The detectives then took Qin down and escorted him to the mortuary. Prosecutor Diao Chengtang, along with clerk Wang Zuyi and medical examiners Wei and Zhang, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. After a thorough examination, they took their seats and questioned Qin A'fa again. They stated that the examination revealed that the deceased Gao Yihe was indeed stabbed in the leg by Qin A'fa before his death. The body was handed over to Pulun Mountain Villa for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e207">A Record of Lingering Fragrance <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Besides these, like hand towels, powder, rouge, combs, etc., everything a female emperor uses for makeup is available. The most ingenious is this box, which can be used as a handrail when lowered and instantly turns into a long mirror when lifted: thus, the Empress Dowager can dress up as much as she likes on the way without being seen by others.</p>
<p>She absolutely did not allow her people to steal a peek at her, so no one dared to stand and watch when her imperial carriage passed by on the street. In fact, we all knew that those commoners often poked small holes in the paper windows to secretly watch the imperial carriage passing in front of their doors: the only one who didn't know was the Empress Dowager herself. Even if someone told her, she would not believe that there were people so daring. However, in order to ensure extra secrecy, special curtains were hung on both sides of the window of this imperial carriage. Two curtains were hung on each side of the window, the same length. However, the one closer to the inside, two in total on the left and right - because it was right next to where she was sitting - was made of yellow satin lined with silk wadding. Not only could people outside not see in, but she herself could not see out; wouldn't this be too stuffy? So the one on the outside (there were two in total on the left and right) was changed to transparent light gauze, so that she could vaguely see the scenery outside without being seen by people outside. If she still felt that it was too unclear or too difficult to see through this layer of light gauze, she could lean forward, gently pull open some of the gauze curtains, and look sideways. Even so, outsiders need not think of spying on her. Even the sharpest eyes could only see a few of her fingers at most. (40)</p>
<h3 id="e208">Bright Moon <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>A boundless azure sky, hanging a round mirror-like bright moon, sparkling and clear, without a trace of dust, vaguely like an unparalleled beauty in the instant after bathing, stark naked, craning her neck to look out the window; sometimes, those light wisp-like clouds, pushed by the gentle breeze to her bosom, enveloping her, but that is just like a layer of light gauze draped over icy skin and jade flesh, not detracting from her beauty, but rather adding to her charm, I am truly fascinated by her, because she is so beautiful. When I was in my hometown, I would often run alone to the lawn, sit on the ground, and look up, watching her being covered by dense clouds and mist, and I would feel sorry for her, watching her jump out of the clouds lively, and I would be indescribably happy, she pondered, and I pondered, and I and she had merged into a spiritual communion, the cold wind tousled my hair, and the dew dampened my clothes, I did not care; people said I was crazy, I just laughed it off, because this beautiful, purified state of mind, can only be told to those who understand, and is really difficult to tell to others. When I return extremely tired, the moon teaches me to walk with my shadow as a companion; I take off my clothes and go to bed, and the moon secretly climbs into the window lattice again, moves onto the bed, kisses me, caresses me, until I fall asleep, that round face of hers, always radiates a benevolent light, when I was in my hometown, she was like this, when I am away from home, she is also like this; if the sun symbolizes a father who combines grace and power, she is a mother who nourishes us with pure love.</p>
<p>However, even a small flame can be obscured by many flames, on the road flanked by tall buildings, in the alleys, she is often robbed of her place by the incandescent electric light, if not for "a full moon tonight", I would have forgotten her long ago, this is my fault.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Paper House <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>"Look, everyone, go to 'Shenxiang Pavilion' to see the burning paper houses." People, big and small, who like to join in the fun in the alleys, were shouting like this. This large, × residence was holding a Buddhist service in Shenxiang Pavilion. There were quite a few male and female guests. Added to the people outside coming to see the excitement, it was extremely crowded for a while. At this time, several workers were putting branches, straw, and the like in the open space in the courtyard. On top, they spread reed mats flat. Then they moved the already made paper house from the main hall and hooked it up one after another. There was a front yard, and a back yard. In addition to the halls and厢房, there were kitchens and garages. It was truly magnificent: all kinds of furnishings were prepared inside, such as wireless radios and other entertainment items, everything was available, just like the real thing. Although it was a miniature paper house, people could actually go in and out. Inside, there were also piles of underworld money and paper ingots, so it could be considered that everything for enjoyment was already there.</p>
<p>So the audience all praised and said, "Although the old lady is dead, she is really blessed, she can still live in such an elaborate house." Some people also sighed and said, "I heard that this paper house cost more than one hundred and several tens of yuan in silver when it was ordered from the paper goods store. That's almost half a year's worth of food for a poor family!"</p>
<p>After the monks finished chanting sutras: they lit a fire and burned the paper house. Suddenly, the flames soared, with a burst of crackling sounds. In an instant, this "reverent in appearance" paper house turned to ashes.</p>
<p>At this time, the family members and relatives and friends of the × residence all had smiles on their faces. It seemed that by doing this, they had fulfilled the "rites of a son". The deceased old lady, under the nine springs, could get some comfort.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-ninth Reply Letter With Sadness, Claiming Solitude, Listen Together To Swear Blood To Dismantle Jingzhong</p>
<p>Jiang said: If you want to write a reply, that's fine, but after you write the letter, you must read it to me. If it's not right, I can tell you to change it. Don't think I don't recognize the words, I have eaten a few more pounds of salt than you, and maybe I can see things you can't see. Guizhi said: That's fine too. Originally, I couldn't recognize even three words, so what's the point of writing a letter. But I can't ask anyone to write this kind of letter, so I have to make do with it myself. After saying that, he immediately took the letter to his own room, closed the door, and slowly started writing. After writing for about two hours, looking up the thousand-character classic and elementary school textbooks, he pieced together a letter. Then he ordered someone to take the letter to the front yard to report to Jiang. When Jiang saw Guizhi ordering someone to bring the letter in, he knew that he was going to read it to him, so he grabbed Guizhi's sleeve and pulled him straight into the inner room, then let him sit on the edge of the brick bed, sat down opposite him, and asked him softly? Read it, don't shout. So Guizhi held the letter and read:</p>
<p>To Uncle Ji Zhi: I was very surprised to receive your letter. I am now on very good terms with Company Commander Zhao, as everyone knows. As the saying goes, a horse should not be saddled twice, and a woman should not marry two men. Although I am the daughter of a poor family, I also know some propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. How can there be a virtuous wife who communicates with others. Since you have written a letter, I can't stop you, I hope you won't do this in the future, if people find out, it would be a joke. You are a gentleman, do I need to say more? I hope you will forgive me. My mother also knows about this and sends her regards to you. Zhao Yang Guizhi sends his greetings</p>
<p>After listening, Jiang nodded and said: That's about it. But how should this letter be sent? (390)</p>

<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Baoshan Road north crosses Qiujiang Road, less than two hundred paces, and Hongxing Road comes from the northwest to meet. Currently, at the intersection of these two roads, the Shanghai Police Memorial Tower is being built. Construction has been underway for several months, with dozens of stonemasons chiseling away day and night. The tower base is built into a trapezoid shape, wider at the back and narrower at the front, according to the terrain, all made of stone. There are three stone steps on the front and back to climb up, with giant stones used as railings, also divided into three levels, getting higher and higher towards the back. A stone statue platform is paved in the middle, and a square stone the size of an eight immortals table is used as the base in the center, with a tower core more than ten feet high glued on with cement. The tower core will be surrounded by giant stones measuring a foot thick, five feet wide, and ten feet long to form a square pillar shape. Currently, these four giant stones have been chiseled out. On one stone is carved the inscription "Shanghai Municipal Martyrs' Police Memorial Tower" in twelve large characters, inscribed by Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and it has also been engraved. The unveiling ceremony can be held soon when these four giant stones are erected. After the January 28th Incident, Baoshan Road was covered in scars, but now it has been slightly rebuilt. The addition of this solemn and magnificent memorial tower is enough to add to its embellishment.</p>
<p>On the side of Baoshan Road, there are open spaces everywhere. The former Chinese mansions are now flat ground. Since the beginning of spring, the survivors of the disaster have greatly developed the interest in flying kites. On days when the wind is gentle and the sun is warm, they all come to this open space to launch a kite into the sky. On the ground, the young and old are bustling, looking up and laughing. In the sky, there are centipedes, eagles, four-cornered and eight-cornered kites, long snakes, airplanes, and other kites in various shapes, nothing is too strange.</p>
<p>Sometimes moving, sometimes still, sometimes sinking, sometimes floating, each taking advantage of the long wind to compete. The once densely populated Baoshan Road has now transformed into a place for chasing kites. Who could have foreseen this two and a half years ago?</p>

<p>Qian Da of Jiangnan</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, there were many writers who followed Zong Ding, and the trend of the times made it extremely popular for a while, precisely because Dragon's writing was unrestrained and bold, with a wonderfulness that could not be measured. At that time, Tiannan Dun Sou's great name shook Hainan, Dun Sou had entered the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, not only was his writing strangely unrestrained, but he was also clear about the general trend of the world, and the strategy of war and defense. The scholars of the southeast all regarded him as the head of the literati, but his school of thought originated from Ding. Zou Jiugai, Mr. Zou Jiugai of my county, had been with Dun Sou for the longest time, and deeply inherited his mantle. His writing could melt the old and new of that time in five furnaces, and his poems and lyrics were also deeply affectionate and meaningful, not to be seen as ordinary chapters of singing about the wind and admiring the moon. Mr. had been famous at home and abroad for his poems and essays between Tongzhi and Guangxu, and enjoyed a literary name for thirty years, which can be said to be a long time. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, I and my old friend Jin Shishou met Mr. at the Shousi Lou in Xujiahui, Shanghai. I was just a young man and Mr. was already over seventy. We felt like old acquaintances at first sight and talked for half a day. We then made a friendship that transcended age. At that time, I wrote six poems to record the event, which are published in Free Talk. Mr. broke his foot while traveling, and I often went to visit him in my spare time. Later, Mr. moved back to his hometown of Houzhai, and I never saw him again, only occasionally exchanging letters. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, I and Cheng Xiaoqing, Xu Bibo and other gentlemen founded the Gongyuan Cinema in Wumen. Mr. read the newspaper and learned about it and sent a letter to congratulate us. One morning, I was still asleep, when Mr. Zhou came from Xiyou Su, drove to visit. The servants, seeing that I had not gotten up and that Mr.'s clothes were not fancy and he had a limp, were arrogant and impolite, and refused to let him in. Mr. then threw his card and left. When I got up, the servant brought in the card, saying that a lame old man had come a moment ago, told him that Mr. had not gotten up, and left. Looking at the card, it was Mr.'s name. I blamed the servant for being rude and thinking that the world judged people by their clothes. If Mr. had worn fancy clothes, the servant would have been respectful and called me to wake up. There is a saying that dogs look down on people, and there are many people with dog eyes in the world, let alone servants? What's the point of blaming him? I quickly hired a rickshaw to visit him. At that time, Mr. was living in a Buddhist temple. We were happy to see each other and talk about the past. However, Mr. had already shown signs of decline and was no longer as robust as he used to be, which made me feel sad for a long time. A few years later, Mr. died. I never thought that this hurried meeting would be our last. Mr. was a lyricist of a generation, but his life after death was very desolate. It is a pity that heaven gave talent to people like this!</p>
<p>To see the true picture of officialdom, there is no better book than Mr. Nanting Tingchang's "Records of the True Appearance of Officialdom", which can be said to be colorful and vividly depicts the ugliness. It is said that in the mountains, the spring water is clear, but it becomes turbid when it comes out of the mountains. The environment makes it so. I have seen many people over the years, but no one is more honest and treats people with kindness than Mr. Wu Zonglian of Yucheng. Mr. Wu Zonglian's courtesy name is Yiqing. He served in important positions during the late Qing Dynasty. After the Republic of China, he served as a member of the National Assembly and ministers to various countries. He was especially proficient in French and was a veteran of our country's diplomatic circles. Today, among the important figures of the party and the country, there are not a few who have studied under him. When I met Mr., he was the director of the French Concession Public Works Bureau. He was already over seventy years old. At first sight, I knew that he was a kind and amiable elder. At that time, Mr. also served as the general manager of a certain shipping company. He was not familiar with this field, but a few people used his name for other purposes. I learned the details and strongly advised him not to sacrifice his reputation for nothing. Later, Mr. also realized this and resolutely left. However, because of his honest nature, he was easily fooled by others everywhere. Often, before one thing was finished, he would fall into the trap again in an instant. He had to make compensation because he guaranteed for others, and he had been involved in lawsuits for a long time, but he still failed in the end. However, he suffered a lot of losses in terms of reputation because he was played by villains several times. After his death, some people said that he was too eager to seek advancement and was too persistent in one thing, to the point where he was scolded in person. I alone said that this was actually forced by the environment. At that time, Mr. had to bear a burden of five or six hundred gold per month. In recent years, his later years had been gradually declining, his income had been sharply reduced, and he had to borrow money to make a living. He found it really difficult not to seek a way out. It was pitiful that he was still running around in his old age. However, summing up his life, he was too honest and not smart enough. Therefore, he went through officialdom, but he still had nothing to his name and died unhappily. However, it is rare and valuable to be an official without money in today's world. Mr. once asked me to introduce him to the Kuomintang. Unexpectedly, Mr. had already passed away as soon as the central party certificate was issued. This certificate is still with me.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Philippine Newspapers Uphold Justice and Criticize the Philippine Sports Authorities A Country That Is Not Yet Independent Dares to Publicly Violate World Opinion Arrogantly Wants to Recognize the Pseudo-Organization Cowardly, Untrustworthy, and Without Independent Personality <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 22nd) On the 22nd, various Philippine newspapers published commentaries heavily criticizing the Philippine sports authorities for being coerced by Japan to overturn the resolution of the 20th Congress, illegally disband the Far Eastern Games, and form a new association. The Manila Bulletin and the Tribune both stated that the Philippines' fear of Japan was like a subordinate's fear of a superior. Currently, in all countries around the world, except Japan, there is a country that is not yet independent that violates world opinion and wants to recognize the pseudo-organization. This is extremely arrogant. The Philippine sports community has also launched a great resistance to the reckless actions of a few leaders who violate public opinion, and they are unwilling to join the new association. Our country's representatives believe that this kind of rogue behavior is entirely the result of Japan's use of political violence, and that the Philippines is willing to collude with it under coercion, which is exposing its weakness of fearing Japan and showing that it has no independent personality. They have decided to ignore it. The current meeting of the committee did not dare to mention the pseudo-organization, that is, the so-called new association, and did not dare to publicly propose it. We have not failed in justice. Furthermore, it can be seen that the Philippines fears Japan. In the high hurdle competition on the 17th, the Japanese player Kiyoshi Adachi won the third place, but he had knocked down four hurdles. The Philippine prosecutor judged that he was disqualified. Japan filed an unreasonable protest. The competition committee accepted the protest and withdrew the prosecutor's judgment, causing all the prosecutors to angrily withdraw and issue a declaration criticizing the authorities. The authorities then hired another prosecutor to stop the line. From this, it can be seen that the Philippine authorities are cowardly and incompetent.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Manila, 22nd) The Manila Newspaper, owned by Americans here, wrote an article attacking the actions of Japan and the Philippines in the Far Eastern Games. The article said that the dissolution of the Far Eastern Games by Japan and the Philippines was a cowardly and untrustworthy act. The article continued that China was the country that initially initiated the Far Eastern Games twenty-two years ago. At yesterday's meeting, although the Philippine side was extremely solemn in form, it ultimately listened to Japan's orders and made China withdraw. Under such circumstances, it was very reasonable for China to withdraw. The only thing we cannot answer is why the Philippines did this. The Philippines certainly has the right to choose its friends. If they think Japan is better, then at least they should apologize to China and do this act of untrustworthiness and cowardice. The representatives of Japan and the Philippines dissolved the Far Eastern Games in the absence of the Chinese representatives yesterday and created the Oriental Amateur Sports Association to accommodate "Manchukuo." The Chinese delegation believes that this move is illegal because China has not received proper notification of the actions of Japan and the Philippines.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 22nd) Zhang Jiong, Director of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, said that the Far Eastern Games has a glorious history. It is the accumulation of the spirit of all member countries for thirty years, and it can only be promoted and developed by the spirit of all member countries. It cannot be easily destroyed by a few member countries with ambitions. As for forcibly revising the constitution and attempting to have the puppet Manchukuo participate, our country's representatives have no need to discuss it. The responsibility for destroying the Sports Association and destroying the Far Eastern Games this time should of course be borne by Japan. The Ministry has not yet received detailed telegrams from the representatives, but our delegation has left the Philippines and is returning home. After they arrive, the Ministry will immediately convene the Sports Committee to make a solemn statement to clarify our country's position.</p>

<p>(Central 22nd, Manila) After the Japan-Philippines meeting on the 21st organized the so-called East Asia Amateur Sports Association, they also notified the pseudo-organization that if they applied to join, they would be approved.</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd) The director of the Japan Sports Association, Tabata, visited the traitor Ding Shiyuan at the puppet state's embassy at 6 p.m. yesterday, saying that the regular meeting of the Far Eastern Games in Manila had decided to dissolve the Far Eastern Games and organize a new meeting. After your country's Sports Association requests it, your country will be decided as a new member country. Therefore, he advised them to apply to participate.</p>

<p>(Central 22nd, Manila) Although the friendship between China and the Philippines in sports has been severed, our delegation's attitude is bright and generous. On the 22nd, they still hosted a banquet for the Philippine sports authorities. At the same time, overseas Chinese leaders and the overseas Chinese press were invited. During the banquet, our chief representative, Wang Zhengting, delivered a speech, thanking the Philippine side for their recruitment and the enthusiastic assistance of the overseas Chinese. Then, the Philippine representative Vargas replied, saying that without China's assistance, this conference would not have been so successful, and hoped that international competitions could continue in the future. Some aspects were not well understood at the luncheon on the 22nd, but our delegation claimed that the invitations had been sent out and could not be canceled in four days.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Far Eastern Games Highlights Record <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen)</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Manila) The Chinese athletes' delegation attending the 10th Far Eastern Games has been in Manila for five days, and the dog meeting also opened yesterday. In the past few days, the sports columns of domestic newspapers must have been full of news about the conference. Everyone must be very concerned about the situation of our athletes, the situation of the conference, and the progress of the competition. The reporter came to the Philippines with the army, and had long wanted to write more highlights to report to everyone. However, time is really tight. It is stipulated that athletes get up at six or seven o'clock in the morning, but it is already noisy at six o'clock. If you want to sleep a little longer, don't even think about it. You can't go to bed until after twelve o'clock in the evening. All day and night, I am busy visiting the news and sending telegrams. I can hardly find time to eat. However, since I have the opportunity to participate in such a grand event, I would feel really bad if I didn't report something to everyone. So I had to steal some time from my busy schedule to write something that is not very good.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Chinese Team That Won the Far Eastern Games Football Championship <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<h3 id="e220">The Mermaid Alarmed the Philippine Island <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Our Dao Da Zhonghua's mermaid is really a mermaid. When she swam from Hong Kong to the President McKinley, she stirred up the air on the wheel. Look at her bare legs, changing three or four sets of clothes as light as cicada wings a day, swimming east to west, west to east. The athletes' eyes were really dazzled by her swimming. Now our Dao mermaid has swam to the Philippines again, and the hot air in Manila has been stirred up again. The dormitories of the Philippine Women's University are crowded with journalists and overseas Chinese every day. The newspapers publish her photos in different poses every day. No matter where she goes, whoever she meets, when they talk about Chinese athletes, they talk about the mermaid. So "China produces beauties" and "China produces mermaids" spread throughout the Philippine Islands. Our mermaid is really a mermaid, but we hope that our mermaid will not only focus on the word "beauty", but forget that she is a swimming fish.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The General Life of Athletes <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Our delegation, except for General Team Wang Zhengting and his wife, who live in the home of Consul General Kuang Guanglin, and the two representatives Hao Gengsheng and Shen Siliang, who live in the Manila Hotel, the female athletes live in the Philippine Women's University, and the male athletes live in Lacha University. They are all very close to the Rizal Sports Ground (Japanese and Dutch Indian athletes also live here). The dormitory is the original classroom, and the congressmen and athletes are the same. Twenty or thirty people are crammed into one room. Except for a small bed and a small mosquito net, there is nothing else. Everyone is living a very simple life happily. Philippine mosquitoes are really good. Every morning when we wake up from a tired sleep, we always find many red bumps on our bodies. However, after a day of fatigue, when we fall on the bed, we are like dead people, letting the mosquitoes suck some blood. We really don't care about it, so we don't think it's hard. The food is contracted to a Cantonese overseas Chinese chef. On the first day, we ate Chinese food, a few dishes that were not sweet, not salty, not sour, not spicy. Although we were hungry, we still found it difficult to swallow. The next day, we changed to Western food, but it was just him serving the same dishes again. However, our funds are insufficient, and we cannot bring more than a dozen chefs with us like the Japanese. There is no way to do it. The athletes have all made up their minds to fill their stomachs as long as they go to the dining hall, and they must fight hard on the sports field. Therefore, everything is calm and quiet, and there is no war in the dining hall.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Weather Is Extremely Hot and the Practice Is Hard <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The weather in May is the hottest time in the Philippine Islands. Schools are on summer vacation, and the mercury in the thermometer often rises to one hundred degrees. For the sake of our athletes, especially those from the north, it is really a bit unbearable to practice non-stop in such a climate. They sweat all day long, and everyone is not afraid of the stench, and there is a layer of black oil on their faces. Everyone thinks that it has increased their healthy beauty, but their skin is tanned and scorched, even to the point of cracking. Everyone is gritting their teeth, which is really a bit difficult to endure. They take cold showers every day, and the bodies that are drenched in sweat are poured over their heads with cold water. If it weren't for the fact that they would sweat again after washing, I don't believe that everyone could safely maintain their health.</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Reporter Was Actually Surrounded <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Journalists from various countries who came specifically to explore news about the conference, Japan came a total of sixteen, but our country is just a small area. Compared in quantity, it is really like a small witch seeing a big witch. But there is one thing that can comfort everyone, that is, the small area did not lose the face of the country because of the small number. On the first day of arrival, as soon as I walked into the dormitory, I was surrounded by a large number of colleagues from the local Chinese and Western newspapers. The next day's newspapers, in addition to the written records, also published a photo of the small area in an important section. This really made me a little flattered. At 7:30 p.m. on the 10th, the Manila Journalists Association hosted a banquet for foreign journalists at the largest and largest St. Anne's Dance Hall in the world. Important local colleagues personally came to receive us. In addition to attending on time, I also invited Shi Zhaokang and Zhou Jiaqi, who were also sending telegrams for Shen Xin, and representative Hao Gengsheng to go with me. However, a large number of Japanese colleagues did not come until after 8:30 p.m. In the initial impression, we had already won a small victory. In the middle of the banquet, the host and guests inevitably gave speeches to each other. The host was the Associated Press's Moore and the Philippine Free Society's Rogets, who delivered welcome speeches. We pushed Mr. Hao to deliver a reply speech, and his eloquent remarks won a lot of applause. The Japanese representative stood up, said a few incoherent words simply, and sat down. The banquet ended after several special dance performances. A large number of Japanese reporters left silently and without beginning or end. We went around for a while before saying goodbye. At this solemn and grand colleague banquet, we finally did not disgrace our mission and won a little face for the country.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we detailed the illegal dissolution of the Far Eastern Athletic Association by Japan and the Philippines and the subsequent organization of the so-called East Asian Amateur Athletic Association. Relying on its political and diplomatic threats, Japan compelled the Philippine representative to accept orders from another power, leaving them no choice but to succumb. As a result, our country, which has always been at the mercy of others, has also suffered a setback in sports diplomacy today, influenced by the decline of our national vitality. However, the sudden change in the Philippine representative's attitude warrants further examination.</p>
<p>The Philippines prepared for this year's Far Eastern Championship Games for over a year, spending more than a million yuan on projects such as building the Rizal Memorial Stadium. During this time of economic panic, in addition to making every effort to make up the cost, they also had to rely on ticket sales to supplement the expenses. However, after Japan proposed the requirement for the participation of the puppet organization, during the trilateral roundtable conference convened in Shanghai, the Philippine representative strictly maintained neutrality, refraining from expressing any opinions, fearing any disadvantage to either China or Japan, which might hinder the Games from proceeding as scheduled and cause significant economic losses. Therefore, they tried their best to appease both China and Japan, hoping to preserve the Philippines' position and the painstaking effort of investing heavily in the 10th Games, so that the Games could be held as scheduled. Thus, they proposed submitting this issue to the regular executive committee meeting to be held during the Games, and the roundtable conference temporarily ended as such. Our country fell into their trap.</p>
<p>As a result, the Games were able to proceed as scheduled. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines believed that the Philippine representative's unchanging attitude at the Shanghai roundtable conference and the failure of Japan's cunning schemes were fortunate and offered their full spiritual and material support to the Philippine Athletic Association, welcoming the motherland on one hand and supporting the Philippines on the other. The Games proceeded smoothly, and ticket sales increased significantly. The Philippine Athletic Association itself should have expressed sincere friendship in terms of moral and spiritual values, given our Athletic Association's sincere maintenance and the overseas Chinese's wholehearted assistance. Unexpectedly, not only did they not do this, but they also drastically changed their sinister faces, believing that their goal had been achieved. They intensified their efforts to assist the wicked, colluding with Japanese imperialists to dissolve the Far Eastern Athletic Association through extraordinary means and initiate the pseudo-organization of the East Asian Athletic Association. People like the Filipinos are worse than snakes and scorpions; it is not enough to talk about eating their flesh and sucking their blood to vent our indignation.</p>

<p>Re-scheduled to be held in advance at 5 PM on the 26th</p>
<p>800, 200, and 3000-meter three preliminary events</p>
<p>---Competition Department staff has already been appointed---</p>
<p>The fifth amateur public sports meet organized by the Municipal Education Bureau has received over 500 participants by the registration deadline, more than in previous years. It is learned that the Education Bureau originally scheduled the opening ceremony for 8 AM on the 27th of this month and would begin the competition immediately afterward. However, due to the large number of people and the fact that many athletes will be participating in several events in one day, it is feared that they will not have enough energy. Therefore, it has been changed to hold the preliminary rounds of the 800-meter, 200-meter, and 3000-meter events in advance at 5 PM on the 26th (Saturday), after the closing ceremony of the Joint Elementary School Sports Meet. Participants in these three events are requested to be on time. In addition, the staff of the competition department has been appointed as follows:</p>
<p>Director of the Competition Department: Jiang Shuxun Chief Referee: Dong Chengkang Track Referee Director: Dong Chengkang Track Referees: Zhou Junren, Zhang Wenyuan, Wang Meizhong, Huang Shengbai Starter: Chen Yuze Inspectors: Zhang Longhai, Hu Zongfan Examiners: Yin Lisheng, Xu Mingle Track Records: Xiang Xianggao Timer: Sun Yiming, Shen Zhaofeng Field Referee Director: Sun Hebin Field Referees: Gu Yu, Shen Xian, Ruan Weilin, Wang Huating Field Records: Gong Zhenyi Announcer: Wen Huaiyu, Qu Yue, Shen Baolun Chief Record Keeper: Xiang Xianggao Chinese Martial Arts Judges: Tong Zhongyi, Hua Xiangjiu, Luo Shuqing, Liu Desheng</p>

<p>Yesterday also beat the 克馬 team by one to zero</p>
<p>In the first Shanghai Open Handball Tournament, the doubles team of Zhu Kuan, Hong Yu Kui, yesterday defeated the doubles champions of the West Qing team, 克拉麥馬, and 駱夫, by two to zero again. Zhu and Hong have excellent skills and experience. Zhu is especially outstanding. The wonder of saving dangers and killing shots is almost unbelievable. Zhu and Hong have already won against two powerful doubles teams. The champion seat is almost certainly theirs. That night, a certain 西靑 singles player named 却克令 defeated 批安斯 by two to zero. In other singles matches, Sun Daosheng and Luo Tai each won without labor due to their opponents' default.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>

<p>Minli Has Already Won the Women's Championship</p>
<p>The second day of the Middle School Athletic Association Volleyball Tournament was held yesterday. A gentle breeze and thin clouds made for pleasant conditions. Each of the athletes was energetic and competed fiercely on the track and field. In the first match, Fudan Brothers fought against each other in their own camp. Fudan Middle was no match for Fudan Practical, losing by two to one. However, both sides fought earnestly during the battle and did not show favoritism, so the scores were very close. Hujiang defeated Minli, like a tiger capturing a sheep. Jinan defeated Fudan Practical, expending all their strength. The Fudan Practical team had many veteran players, and Fudan has a tradition of producing volleyball stars. However, their defeat to Jinan yesterday was purely due to panic in the heat of the moment. In addition, Jinan's front-row blocking was strong. Although Fudan Practical tried their best to block, it was difficult to be effective. But Fudan Practical's defeat means that the final will become a multi-faceted love affair. If Jinan can defeat Hujiang again today, they can win the Group 中 final. If they are defeated by Hujiang again, they will form a three-legged situation with Fudan Practical and Hujiang, and they will have to fight again. And the battle between Guanghua and ? scheduled for today will have to wait for a good time. On the women's side, Minli did not have to use an arrow or spill blood when they first met Patriotic, and they got two points easily. Yesterday, they defeated Guanghua again, making it easy. The championship is securely won, and there is no problem. Today's battle between Guanghua and Patriotic is completely unrelated to the main point. The order and results of yesterday are listed below.</p>

<p>Sports Performance—To Be Held Soon</p>
<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School in Jiangwan has been established for ten years, with remarkable achievements. Now that it is the tenth anniversary, according to the school authorities, it was originally intended to expand the celebration to commemorate it. However, in the current national crisis, it is not what is desired. Therefore, the students' usual achievements in each subject will be performed in stages. The sports performance is scheduled for May 27th, the track and field sports meet is on June 3rd, and the commemorative ceremony will be held on the morning of the 14th, with a recreational meeting in the afternoon. A large number of people will visit at that time, so the school has agreed with the China General Omnibus Company that the No. 4 public bus will extend the closing time to 12 o'clock to facilitate transportation. It is also heard that the school authorities, in order to encourage the New Life Movement, will decline all gifts and congratulatory messages sent to the school to save expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Groundbreaking for New Provincial Shanghai Middle School Building <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>School Site Over 400 Mu, Construction Cost 700,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Requesting Education Commissioner of Jiangsu Province Zhou Fohai to Officiate at the Groundbreaking</p>
<p>Due to the small school site, unsuitable school buildings, and poor environment, the Provincial Shanghai Middle School in this city had plans to relocate and rebuild as early as five or six years ago. In recent years, with the efforts of Principal Zheng Xigu of the school and the support of provincial and municipal authorities and community members, steady progress has been made. Last winter, all procedures for selling the old school site and purchasing the new site were completed. This spring, architect Qi Minghe was commissioned to draw up plans for the new school buildings, and construction began in mid-March. Yesterday afternoon, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at the new school site in Wujia Lane on Hu-Min Road. Over two hundred people attended, including representatives of the school's faculty, staff, and students, as well as Commissioner Gu, representing Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Education Commissioner Zhou of the Jiangsu Education Department, Counselor Luo, representing Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Bureau Directors Pan, Wu, and Wen, Director Xu, Magistrate Pan of Shanghai County, Section Chief Xue of the Provincial Education Department, and guests Ouyang Yuanhuai, Jiang Wenyu, Yao Mulian, He Bocheng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Zhixin, and others, totaling over fifty people. At 2:00 PM, the meeting commenced with music, followed by a ceremonial procession. Education Commissioner Zhou laid the foundation stone, and Principal Zheng delivered a speech, reporting on the process of relocation and rebuilding, and the points of effort that should be made in the future. Next, Education Commissioner Zhou delivered a speech, hoping that the school would pay attention to material construction, and at the same time, pay attention to spiritual training. Counselor Luo, Bureau Directors Pan, Wu, and Ouyang Yuanhuai, Jiang Wenyu, and Lin Kanghou then delivered speeches successively, with much encouragement in their words. The meeting concluded with a photo session at 4:30 PM. It is reported that the new school site covers a total of 450 mu, and the cost of purchasing the land, constructing the buildings, and equipping the facilities is approximately 700,000 yuan, truly a model for middle schools in the country. In the future, it is also planned to implement life education, and at the same time, use the school as the center of the community to promote compulsory education and engage in rural improvement.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Making a Big Deal Out of a Small Thing <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Yu</p>
<p>Big topics are difficult to tackle, and I'm too lazy to do them, so I can only do small topics; the outcome of small topics won't be big, and yet I yearn for something big, so I have to make a big deal out of a small thing.</p>
<p>The Eight-legged Essay examination for scholars, its essence is to cut out several small pieces from the classics, and ask the scholars to connect the meaning of the text, to become a kind of grand essay; but those who write grand essays in a vast and unrestrained manner are rejected, not only is it strenuous for the writer and taxing for the reader, but also everyone talks about "Now, of all things under heaven...", so wouldn't the world gradually become unstable from all the talking? Originally, there were ingenious methods for binding people's hearts and suppressing thought long ago.</p>
<p>However, once people are no longer selected based on essays, does the situation change? It's best not to talk, and don't even think, everyone should be leisurely. But if you must speak? The concession has Western prisons, the police have whips, the wilds have winding paths, the marshes have hesitation, letters are detained, newspapers have ink: ... how to stop it? You can still speak, but you're only allowed to say things like "leisurely," "refined," "subtle," "indirect": ... you're not allowed to say things like "Now, of all things under heaven"... In that case, is there no one left to speak about "the world"? In modern times, there seem to be quite a few. Talented people with golden words and embroidered mouths, experienced writers with imposing styles, are more beautiful than parrots and more skillful than monkeys. They still speak eloquently, with methods, and it's still "making a big deal out of a small thing."</p>
<p>For example, "There is a reason for the incident, but no evidence has been found," this kind of ingenious saying that doesn't touch the edges of things certainly seems very reasonable, but it has already buried right and wrong. Once the sense of right and wrong is lost, there is much more that can be said, so Jin Shengtan's head, and the heads of barbarians, are sold together: the ghosts of Yuan Zhonglang, X Zhonglang reappear in the world. What's more, wandering freely and treating all things equally, actually have emptiness and nothingness, messing around and trying to make oneself confused about everything. Fortunately, contemporary writers are not deeply rooted in antiquity, otherwise, they could bring out some bizarre and gaudy antiques to dazzle the ears and eyes of modern people.</p>
<p>But readers are often dissatisfied with small topics, so the other side has to make a big deal out of it. We only see "humor," "vulgar characters," "Western suits are not good to discuss": ... resounding in our ears, but they are all actually small topics, and the effort is really wasted.</p>
<h3 id="e244">On the Ping-Sui Railway Line <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>It is not comfortable to sit on the Ping-Sui train. In addition to the vibrations, the train also travels slowly.</p>
<p>Some people in Beiping who pull camels to carry heavy loads often make those two-humped animals proceed in strings on the railway tracks. The copper bells under the long whiskers jingle, and when the train comes, they unhurriedly walk away. It is said that the purpose of the copper bells is to scare away wolves.</p>
<p>Apart from the Zhengtai Railway, I am afraid that this is a relatively mountainous and dangerous road. The mountains are in the northern style, bald and completely naked, with large rocks jaggedly stretching out, and a dry landscape painted with dark brown and ginger yellow. Even in April, the ground is not green.</p>
<p>The train does not dare to go fast. One section is because the sleepers are already rotten, and going fast is feared to cause derailment; another section is where the train and the mountain form a right angle of ascent, and there is fear of sliding down halfway; another section is because there are quite a few passengers, and there is fear of decoupling. At one time, there was also the strange phenomenon of insufficient coal and water, but unfortunately I did not see it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>On this train, the armed comrades are always particularly numerous. Numerous but not amicable.</p>
<p>The first stop is Tsinghua Garden, the fifth station is Nankou... I don't need to waste ink repeating what everyone else says about these famous places. To put it simply, when you see more fruit trees, you are close to flat land. Reaching Kangzhuang, the following is flat and truly "Kang" (peaceful). Reaching "Huailai," you can see a vast expanse of orchards from afar.</p>
<p>The roadsides in Jiangnan are green and lush, fresh and full of vigor. Even if they are dilapidated, they still show striving. But in the north of the Great Wall, it is gray and dark, dry and lifeless. Everywhere there are bodies that have lost their souls, everywhere there is stark hunger and cold, houses that do not shelter from the wind and rain, hungry children, large eyes, thin faces.</p>
<p>Arriving at Datong, I particularly saw the cause of poverty. The land is full of sand, and some families rely on the transaction of "sex" for a living.</p>
<p>Around Datong, yellow winds blow almost every day, and sand and gravel obscure the sky, making even the steamed buns gritty. The water is also yellow and turbid. There is only one type of product in the sandy soil: potatoes (i.e., potatoes), which are the vegetables and food for most people, making their mouths feel sour when they eat them. If one day, the desert moves south to Datong, I am afraid that even potatoes will no longer be produced.</p>
<p>Who would willingly sell "sex" for a living? Here there are beautiful colors and small feet. What tears and blood are shed in the circumstances of "people below people"!</p>
<p>In the hot summer, perhaps you can see buckwheat fields, with the ears of wheat fluttering like swallows. Outsiders are not accustomed to eating pancakes made from this, because it is extremely purgative.</p>
<p>The train stops at Baotou, and there are no more railway tracks to the west.</p>
<p>The city of Baotou still has an ancient style. Although the imperialist's kerosene sells well, people still go to bed very early.</p>
<p>One day, I was sitting in a tall building drinking tea, and I saw in the street below a person dressed in formal attire pick up fresh horse manure from the road with his hand and put it in his bosom.</p>
<p>Dried horse manure can be burned as firewood without any smell. It is the only fuel in the Mongolian yurt.</p>
<p>Someone talked to me about going to the Mongolian yurt. You ride on your horse without dismounting, and shout, and if the host welcomes you, a woman will come and invite you to dismount, enter, and sit or lie down in a certain guest seat as you please. When eating, you eat together without having to thank or give money. When leaving, it is best to leave without saying goodbye, and they will not chase after you...</p>
<p>I am not very good at riding horses yet, so I stopped in Baotou and did not go further west.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Translation <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Ping</p>
<p>After Reading the "Literary Works" Special Issue for March-May</p>
<p>"Literary Works" published a "Special Issue on the Literature of Small Nationalities" in March during this half-year period.</p>
<p>Most of the celebrities who recently belittle translation are those who understand foreign languages themselves and can read "the original," but the languages they understand are either English, French, German, or Russian. I'm afraid very few people understand Hungarian, Jewish, and Polish, right? If there were no English, German, or French translations, then how would our celebrities come into contact with the literature of small nationalities?</p>
<p>"Originalism" has misled many students in middle schools and universities, and frightened many readers in the arts and literature!</p>
<p>Our readers do not all understand foreign languages. Even if they have studied them, they only know one or two. However, they have the need to come into contact with world literature, and in addition to the literature of powerful countries, they also have the need to come into contact with the literature of small nationalities. Anyone with a little conscience cannot but admit that our own country's creations are still not as good as foreign works. "Stones from other mountains" should always be welcomed. If not, even if our country's creations are already better than foreign ones, we should still read foreign works, even if it's just to broaden our horizons and enrich our interests. Since we want to read foreign works, then the work of translation cannot be abolished, just as matchmakers are indispensable in an era when men and women do not have direct social interaction and cannot freely fall in love, if they want to get married.</p>
<p>There are also creative writers who look down on translation, because they are afraid that if readers focus too much on translation, they will inevitably "inflate the ambition of others and deflate our own prestige." This can also be used as evidence by drawing parallels to the example of domestic goods versus foreign goods. However, isn't the reason why domestic goods cannot resist foreign goods because domestic goods cannot imitate the manufacturing methods of foreign goods? The key to domestic goods should actually be to urge manufacturers to refer to the manufacturing methods of foreign goods and produce equally exquisite products. Otherwise, modern ladies will ultimately prefer to use imported goods. Economic resistance to the import of foreign goods has failed, but in the arts and literature, the closed-door policy toward foreign works has been highly effective. How can this be?</p>
<p>Lu Xun, who put a lot of effort into translation, once said this in a short essay: "Imagining how open-minded the Han people were, they did not hesitate to use newly arrived plants and animals to fill their decorative patterns. The Tang people were not considered weak either. For example, the stone beasts in front of the tombs of the Han people are mostly sheep, tigers, Tianlu, and Bixie, but on the Zhaoling tombs in Chang'an, there are carved galloping horses with arrows, and even an ostrich, which is simply unprecedented. Nowadays, not to mention on tombs, even in ordinary paintings, would anyone dare to use a foreign flower or a foreign bird? Even on private seals, would anyone be willing to use a cursive script or a vulgar character? Many refined people even use the sexagenary cycle to record the year, and only use the Republic of China era name when forced. I don't know if there are no artists with such boldness, or if there are any, but the people persecute them so much that they can only wither and die?</p>
<p>"The art and literature of the Song Dynasty had a national essence flavor that suffocated people, just like now. However, the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties came in one after another. This news is worth pondering. Although the Han and Tang dynasties also had border troubles, their spirit was ultimately雄大. The people had the confidence not to be slaves to foreign races, or they didn't even think about it. Whenever they took foreign things, it was as if they had captured them and could freely drive them, without any concern. Once they became decadent and declined, their nerves became weak and sensitive. Whenever they encountered foreign things, they learned to look as if they had been captured by them, pushing away, panicking, retreating, escaping, shaking in a ball, and then they had to think up a reason to cover it up, and the national essence became the treasure of weaklings and weak slaves."</p>
<p>Although this passage is not about translation, it can be given to those who look down on translation. Those who insist that translation cannot be good have also made the mistake of making foreign things too frightening. In that short essay, Lu Xun also mentioned Yang Guangxian's opposition to Johann Adam Schall von Bell, saying, "Better to have no good calendar in China than to have Westerners in China." Some opponents of translation today actually have this kind of mentality.</p>
<p>On the reader's side, there are also those who dislike translation because the current translations are often not very fluent and do not look "爽快." In fact, there are various degrees of so-called fluency. Lin Qinnan's translation is generally considered to be fluent, but let us not talk about his "unfaithfulness," but only ask whether people who do not have a deeper cultivation of classical Chinese can "爽快" read Lin's translated novels? Similarly, people who say that the current translations are not 爽快 are actually not very clear about the grammar and structure of modern vernacular Chinese. Other people do not think they are not 爽快. Moreover, demanding fluency is not a proper attitude for readers. When we read ancient Chinese books, we also often encounter places that are not fluent, right? However, I have not heard people deny the value of ancient books because of this. There are also many great writers who imitate the profundity of ancient books, deliberately making them difficult to understand, thinking that they are capable!</p>
<p>In an era when translation work is being hampered to the point of almost complete stagnation, "Literary Works" has published two special issues on translation, which is really a very pleasant thing. The most powerful thing is that in these two special issues, the excellent translations provided answer the question of "Who should translate?" with ironclad proof. After reading Ivan's Misfortune, Twenty-Six and One, Change, Flute Melody in the Mountains in the March "Translation Special Issue" and In Prison, In the Public Security Bureau, Peach Garden, and Life-Taking Taishui in the May "Literature of Small Nationalities Special Issue," we can resolutely say that translators Zhou Jian, Chen Jie, Fen Jun, Zhang Luru, Bing Jia, Lian Suo, and Yu Sheng are the most worthy of the responsibility of translation. Their translations are simply like original creations, and in terms of content, they also make us believe that they are trustworthy, because no flaws can be found. What is especially worth noting is that the names of these translators are all names that we have never seen before. Perhaps there are some pen names of "veterans of the literary world" among them, but there must also be new translators, which is enough to make us very happy.</p>
<p>I believe that these two special issues of "Literary Works" will not be without influence on the Chinese literary world. At the very least, it makes readers believe that China has the above-mentioned excellent translators, and that many other translations can also give people a good impression. Chinese readers will definitely attach importance to translation because of this, and promote the work of translation, and have more contact with world literature, right?</p>
<p>However, "Literary Works" has not yet specifically answered the question of "What to translate?" I hope that "Literary Works" will not only be able to answer this question soon, but also be able to put it into practice soon. For example, many immortal masterpieces of the world have no one to translate, or even if they are translated, no bookstore is willing to print them. "Literary Works" may as well entrust people to translate them and serialize them, even if only one book can be serialized in a year.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Reminiscences <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Bi</p>
<p>—Written in Commemoration of the Third Anniversary of the Death of My Old Friend Chen Xingshu—</p>
<p>(6) Xingshu's nature was very developed, but unfortunately he lost his loving mother as soon as he was born, which he regarded as an unforgettable regret for life. Although he had many brothers and sisters, overflowing with mutual warmth, it still could not reduce his longing for his mother. I had also lost my mother early on, and in my daily actions, I inevitably revealed some sadness. It was on this point that he felt a resonance, and he showed me extra warmth and understanding. In fact, my temperament was fundamentally different from his: I was taciturn and strong, he was gentle and tactful; I was willful in every way, he was tolerant in every way; I could not stand emotional agitation, and often made mistakes in speech, while he could use reason to regulate his emotions, allowing them to develop appropriately. Compared to the two of us, it should have been difficult to reconcile; however, although I myself was stubborn and willful, I very much hoped that others could give me some kind words of comfort, and the one who could comfort me the most was Xingshu; at the same time, I also saw that although Xingshu always took reason into account, he was actually full of rich emotions, and when reason and emotion clashed fiercely in his heart, it must have caused him pain and annoyance. I revealed this observation to him, and he fully agreed that I understood him. Our friendship became strong and firm under such mutual understanding.</p>
<p>I also had a strong aversion to Xingshu's extensive social interactions and his all-encompassing skills. I did indeed criticize him severely, and even openly denounced him as harboring dishonest thoughts and having terrible "means"—this was naturally a deliberate supervision, a kind of challenging oppression. Under such serious ridicule, he always looked extremely wronged, and used his unique tactful tone to explain his position—now that I think about it, how cruel I was—in the end, he cleverly said, "Even if I am a person who is good at using "means," I would not use "means" on you." I accepted this famous sentence very satisfactorily.</p>
<p>I remember once, he was sitting silently in thought, and Zhongchi and I strolled over, and he suddenly said to me, "If possible, what would you hope for in the general public's perception of you?" I frankly said, "I hope that everyone can respect and fear me. That's all. What about you?" I asked him in return. He smiled and said, "I am the same as you, except that I would change the word "respect and fear" to "love" instead." At that time, Zhongchi said directly from the side, "This is the difference in your ideas; that is also the dividing line of your actions."</p>
<p>Now there is one thing that my old friend should know, and that is: in the past, he often advised me to restrain my emotions with words of gold and jade. Although I also had the intention of accepting it at the time, I always thought it was a kind of training in "worldly wisdom" and had nothing to do with the grand purpose of establishing oneself. Now I understand that this was my great misunderstanding. If a person does not do some analytical work in reason, but just goes straight forward and expresses himself in a general way, the result will either be ignorance or deception; this is clearly an unsound consciousness, in other words, it is a great flaw in life. When I think of the many damnable emotional behaviors of the past, I am truly ashamed and without ground, and alas, today's change cannot be praised by Xingshu.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Corpse <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>A Gen held sesame cakes and returned to the store, and many tea customers had already arrived.</p>
<p>There is no need to introduce them one by one, they are all those familiar faces that do not change in wind and rain. The people who can show their faces a little in this Five Families Town are all gathered here.</p>
<p>If it weren't for some kind of fierce general meeting or something, there wouldn't be any strange faces discovered in Fuxing Tea Garden; a person who rarely sets foot in the tea garden who wants to come here for a rest, first of all has to be served by those comrades in long gowns who consider themselves masters—those who wear long gowns in Five Families Town are all people of status—and their eyes are rotating on your face with question marks, huh! Can you also come to the tea garden to chat grandly?</p>
<p>Speaking of A Gen, he is naturally busy serving tea and water, and his feet are always paddling in the mud, and he is thinking about the loss of two big oceans in his heart. He foolishly thinks it is a joke, Zhu Master has not died, outside the door, isn't he? Hey, Zhu big officer, that, Zhu Master must not have died.</p>
<p>"Zhu big officer, Zhu Master has not come?" A Gen was stunned by the two dollars and shouted it out.</p>
<p>Zhu big officer was covered in sweat, and his body was like a swing, with no place to rest. He didn't even call out uncle or elder to so many elders and fathers,</p>
<p>He pushed aside the welcoming A Gen and asked headlessly;</p>
<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>
<p>Old Master Xu is after all sitting in the first seat in Five Families Town. Whoever dares to say no to his ideas, no, his orders, will really not be able to handle it. However, anyone in this Five Families Town can die, but Zhu Xiaoquan can't be without eyes. Old Master Xu almost forgot to eat the sesame cakes, and was planning on this matter of ordering. Zhu Second Officer, that fellow, is not easy to mess with. He doesn't understand what elders and fathers are, let alone the authority of those sitting in the first seat. He talks about fists, and if he kills someone, he can open a pier. If he catches him, he can also say that in twenty years he will be a good man again. What Old Master Xu is most afraid of are good men, because a good man's two fists are not like A Gen's, which often hit his own buttocks. Old Master Xu has been eating three sesame cakes every day for many years, but he has never eaten a fist; however, he is sitting in the first seat in Five Families Town, and if a fist comes flying at his face, he has to move his own face forward to meet it, so A Gen's loss of two dollars for Zhu Xiaoquan's death is in no way as worrisome as one ten-thousandth of Old Master Xu's concern. Zhu big officer has come, "Have you seen him?" It seems that "his" fist is waving in front of Old Master Xu's face, but Old Master Xu, who is sitting in the first seat, cannot but issue an order.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Financial - Silver Price Rise, Gold Price Falls by Four Dollars and Ten Cents - Exchange Market Still Tight, Market Situation Quite Stable - Overnight Silver Frequently Rises, Still Much Struggle <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>In the gold market, during the two days of closure before the previous dynasty, overseas silver markets both rose and fell. However, U.S. President Roosevelt's message to Congress, in which he advocated a gradual approach to purchasing silver, kept people's hearts calm and the market stable. In the early morning, due to the rise of both British and American silver markets overseas, the forward silver price at the precious metals exchange rose by between 1.5 and 2.2 percent. Exchange rates did not fluctuate much. London raw gold rose by half a penny, American cotton fell by eight pounds, and American wheat rose by 8.75. The gold exchange has moved into the new market place and, in accordance with the resolution of the Brokers' Association, will now open at 9:00 a.m., with preliminary trading at 8:55 a.m. Initially, it was $1001.02, then rose to $1002.03. After the opening, with bank support, the domestic market tightened, and the market situation was quite firm, gradually rising. It was expected that HSBC's listing would be extended once, then retreat. However, with healthy bank reserves, the exchange market remained tight. The Central Bank opened with spot prices, which mostly rebounded. Subsequently, the domestic market loosened slightly. Reuters, reporting from the U.S. silver trading floor, stated that most bulls were unwilling to release silver because the President had not yet announced silver policies, which, although lacking major impact, caused the gold market to decline at one point. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy again, maintaining stability. Later, the situation stabilized. Although there were reports of overnight silver prices in Seattle rising by 25 and 125, there was still little change. The future market tended to fall as overnight silver prices in Seattle both rose by 25, approaching the $1,000 mark. People's hearts remained calm. Foreign firms settled accounts, and banks were willing to buy cheaply. Later, prices gradually rose again. Trading in the market was light in the evening, and the market became stagnant, lacking special changes. Afterwards, a spiral pattern emerged, with the situation remaining stable. The price of pure gold was $1015, with swap spreads around $1.50. The day's market situation is recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw little change in the market. Only due to differences in the occasional adoption or abandonment of bull and bear swaps, market prices differed slightly, and the amount was extremely small. Rising and falling cycles did not escape the consolidating trend. Although there were only three days left in this month's trading, both sides were extremely calm, seemingly confident and fearless. Perhaps there would be some slight jostling in the last day or two, but it was likely that there would not be much change. In the first session of the morning, only stock 61 was sold slightly more, and the rest were scattered, with stock 8 being sold at most. Market prices were quite chaotic, with most stocks falling more than rising, by about one cent. Transactions were still swaps. In the second session, bulls had quite a few swaps, with near months weaker and distant months stronger, improving by about one cent in comparison. In the afternoon, bears took the opportunity to swap positions, with stocks 4, 49, and 50 all in demand. They generally continued to improve by about one cent. The closing price was also considered firm. Judging by the trend, it seemed unlikely to decline slightly. Judging by people's minds, most were pessimistic. Therefore, in the near future and after settlement, there would be a period of calm. Yesterday's market price results mostly improved by five cents and one cent.

<h3 id="e261">Grains, Flour, and Wheat Remain Sluggish and Depressed <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Wheat prices experienced a sluggish trend across all months after yesterday's futures market opened. Imported wheat quotations retreated by 10 to 20 cents. Although the weather was variably cloudy and sunny, the climate was very good. According to news from various inland gangs, the new wheat harvest is expected to begin in about a week, with a flourishing market in three weeks. Judging from the current situation, there is a strong indication of a bumper harvest. Given the flat sales of flour and the inability to replenish new goods, the market is expected to continue to decline in the future. As a result, July fell by one cent from the previous day, August fell by three cents, and September fell by three cents. Spot wheat remained flat. As new wheat is about to enter the market, sources of old wheat from various regions continued to arrive. Yesterday, another three to four thousand bags of wheat arrived via the Jinpu Railway. According to estimates by industry members, even after the new wheat is released, old wheat will continue to arrive. It was reported that over four packages of rail wheat from various regions were handled by Fuxin. The prices were estimated to be three yuan for Dangshan and Guide, 2.97 yuan for Dali Ji, 2.95 yuan for Yingzhou, and 2.92 yuan for Bengbu. The second grade was reduced accordingly. The market situation stabilized.</p>
<p>Flour: After the flour market opened yesterday morning, all months initially showed signs of fatigue followed by stability. Imported wheat quotations fell by about 10 to 20 cents in Chicago and about 15 cents in Canada. Therefore, after the opening, market prices for all months were down by one cent or 7.5 cents compared to the previous day. Later, as factories did not sell, the market lacked sufficient chips. External bears made slight adjustments. Afterwards, opening prices showed slight stability again. In the afternoon, the market situation for all months generally consolidated, with very few sales. Although factories were willing to sell, the market lacked buyers, making sales difficult. For example, although the Yingkou Gang moved the previous day, it remained on the sidelines yesterday, indicating that the actual purchasing power was still dismal. According to news from the gang, spot flour market values ​​there had fallen by 17 cents (per dan). Based on this analysis, the future flour market may not be optimistic. As a result, May and June fell by 7.5 cents, July rose by 5 cents, and August, September and October were unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e262">River Down Rice Initially Sluggish, Later Tight <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>(South) Yesterday, the supply from various merchant guilds was somewhat scarce. It is estimated that the arrival of late rice was for the 12th or 13th, thick japonica and various grades for the 13th or 14th (totaling over 5,000 piculs). Regarding sales at the market, for example, the initial market for late rice contracts only showed slight movement from the Beiyang and Weihai guilds, and the situation was still weak. Later, the Nanyang, Xiamen, and Xinghua guilds emerged, competitively purchasing 1,200 to 1,300 packages of Zhongguan goods. The current situation suddenly seemed lively, and sellers took the opportunity to tighten prices. Goods in the middle range were quite active, and the market color slightly turned. At the same time, the Beiyang guild also brought in over 1,000 packages of high-quality goods. Therefore, the overall situation reversed from weak to tight. However, the final market price still found it difficult to loosen the buying pressure, and the gains or losses were not yet apparent. The overall situation of urban and rural shops and warehouses was similar to the previous day. The prices of late rice and various thick japonica, Duyang pointed rice, etc., have all stabilized. Only the price of "Yin Bian Yuan" continued to fall by 1-3 cents because the sales channels were not wide.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the river's various goods arrived on ships numbered 21 and 22. Sales of various grades of white japonica in the market were sparse in the morning but improved at noon. The price of "Bai Yuan" short grain rice continued to soften. Early thin rice was average. Transactions of "Yang Du" and "Bu Ke" pointed rice were sluggish. The market situation for white japonica stabilized, while prices for "Bai Yuan" and early thin rice weakened by a cent or so. High-quality "Yang Jian" rice stabilized, while middle and lower grades were slightly soft. The market for "Cun Bu Ke" pointed rice stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Silk, Tea, Red and Green New Teas Successively Enter the Market <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the tea market of foreign firms in Shanghai, new shipments of red teas from Qimen, Fuliang, Qiupu, Ningzhou, and other areas, as well as green teas from Tunxi, Pingshui, and other areas, arrived. Various tea merchants displayed new samples, totaling over 40 boxes. The much-anticipated Qimen red tea was initially offered by German merchant Xingcheng Foreign Firm at 170 yuan for the first batch. Depending on the quality, high-grade goods from Qimen Southern Road were subsequently offered by firms such as Tongfu and Jinlong at a maximum price of 200 yuan. Fuliang and Qiupu goods were offered at 120-130 yuan, and Ningzhou goods were offered at 86 yuan. The opening market price for red tea was on average 10-20 yuan higher than last year, and the situation was quite favorable. As for the green tea market, sales were also not very quiet. High-grade "Zhen Mei" from Tunxi was initially offered at 132 yuan, and first-grade "Zhu Cha" from Pingshui was initially offered at 86 yuan. The market price was not significantly higher or lower than last year. In addition, there were sporadic transactions of "Zhen Mei," "Zhen Mei needle," and "Shrimp Eye" teas from Wenzhou, Suian, and other areas of local merchants. However, the selling prices were low. Judging from the current market situation, red tea is better than green tea.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Oil Market: Both Hong White and Tung Oil Trend Upward <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Sales of Hongjiang tung oil in the spring were not very brisk, so price fluctuations were only a few cents. After entering the summer season, due to the reduced output of various oil presses in the production area, the supply seemed less abundant than in previous years. The situation suddenly changed, shifting from stable to rising. The output of "Fu Hong Qing Yuan Feng" was the least. According to investigations, the total inventory is only 4,000 to 5,000 barrels, and the supply falls short of demand, which is quite obvious. Merchants had already sensed an opportunity to profit. Although the selling price of local firms has been increased to 23.60 yuan per barrel, the situation is still tight. "Yang Heng Yuan" was larger than "Qing Pai" in previous years, but is now cheaper, probably because the price has not been fully increased. "Zheng Hong Ji Chang He" is still selling for 27 yuan plus a little, and "Ji Ying Feng" is around 26 yuan, which is stable because sales have not yet reached their peak. There were no large transactions of white tung oil by foreign firms in Hankou. However, the supply is still scarce, and only a few transactions can be done at a price of 28 yuan. For larger quantities, the price must be 28.40-28.60 yuan. Last night, Shanghai received a telegram from Hankou stating that the price of Xiang Tung oil opened by Hankou merchants had risen to 23.40-23.50 yuan, an increase of 4-5 cents compared to the previous day. Perhaps foreign firms are conducting procurement, which is unknown. According to the Hangzhou firms, the selling price of Zhejiang tung oil in Shanghai is 25 yuan per "zhu" delivered to Shanghai, and transactions are not numerous. However, since Hankou has tightened, Zhejiang prices are unlikely to be low.</p>

<p>Recently, Hunan lotus seeds have seen slightly more activity due to the rebound in land prices. In addition, the inventory in Shanghai is low, so the price has increased by 3-4 yuan. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade Xiangtan lotus seeds was 46-47 yuan, and the price for second-grade Changde lotus seeds was also 39-40 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market remained weak. The Association's price for Class 14 Coarse Sand White was 20.70 yuan, and only ten packages were sold. The sluggishness of sales can be seen. The price for goods in local warehouses was 20.78 yuan, for transshipment goods 6.77 yuan, and for high-grade No. 8-9 Dutch Red sugar 16 yuan. The price for Taikoo Sugar's "B" mark was 20.80 yuan. It was heard that the off-market price for No. 1 refined white sugar from the local factory had already reached 19.10 yuan. Due to the favorable outlook for brand-name goods, domestically produced Chaoqing sugar merchants were reluctant to sell. The asking price for "Ti Zhuang Qing" was 12.50 yuan, but no transactions were made. Only over 50 packages of genuine refined red sugar were offered at a price of 14 yuan. Hainan red sugar was offered slightly, with a price of 12.50-12.60 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e267">A Word to Our Country's Far Eastern Games Athletes <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Jiasheng</p>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games concluded yesterday (May 20th). Our country, apart from maintaining the football championship and Chen Baoqiu winning second place in the shot put and Fu Baolu winning second place in the pole vault in track and field, all other championships in ball games, track and field, swimming, etc., were won by Japan and the Philippines. It is conceivable that our country's performance cannot catch up with the Far East! Now I understand that our country's delegation will return home on the Jackson steamship the day after tomorrow (23rd). I am 120,000% willing to expose my naked heart to the delegation and hope they will pay attention to this little article of mine.</p>
<p>The reasons why our country's performance is not as good as Japan and the Philippines can be summarized into two points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding innate factors:</p>
<p>I remember a certain Mr. coming to our school last year to give a lecture. He said, "The result of the Third National Games held in Hangzhou was that Liu Changchun and Sun Guiyun were a great sensation, and the whole country admired them. However, after investigating the reasons why they had special achievements in running, I discovered that their ancestors had to run dozens of miles every day in the past, that is, from their homes to other places to do business. Their ancestors had an instinct for running stored in their cells, and this instinct was passed on to later generations. Their descendants are undoubtedly famous runners!" Although we cannot completely trust what Mr. said, at least the development of innate instincts has considerable value. We only need to observe the physique of Westerners and Chinese on the road to know that heredity is not false.</p>
<p>By analogy, our country's backwardness and the lack of innate heredity are undeniable. The only way to remedy this is to temper our physique and move towards a state of health and strength, hoping that our next generation will have a healthy physique and compete with foreign countries again. Japan's improvement in physique is a lesson from the past.</p>
<p>The innate strengths of Japanese and Filipino athletes are stronger, while the innate strengths of our country's athletes are weaker, resulting in backward performance, which we can forgive.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding acquired factors:</p>
<p>The success of any event is never accidental. It requires long-term training and spiritual cultivation. Now, let's discuss them separately:</p>
<p>(A) Long-term training:</p>
<p>This is probably a common problem among our country's athletes! Anyone who has shown some talent in sports does not practice regularly. Only a few weeks before the World Games, the Far Eastern Games, the District Games, the Jiangda Games, the School Games, and the group competitions do they begin to practice. After a long period of cessation, suddenly practicing intensely, can their performance improve? Even if it improves, its rate is definitely not as fast as regular, long-term practice. Therefore, I hope that in the future, athletes will have long-term training and never resort to temporary cramming.</p>
<p>(B) Spiritual Cultivation:</p>
<p>Without spiritual cultivation, the physique cannot be healthy, and performance is even more out of the question! To be honest, Chinese athletes are really lacking in spiritual cultivation. Dance halls, cinemas, cafes..., are full of their traces. Pursuing the opposite sex is their wish. Such destruction of the body and wasting of energy cannot but lead to backward performance. On the one hand, we cannot deny that this is due to the social environment, but who dares to deny their weak will? I hope that in the future, athletes will thoroughly correct their past mistakes and pay attention to spiritual cultivation. This will not only make great progress in performance but also extend our lifespan!</p>
<p>As for other reasons, such as conflicts of opinion among athletes, incorrect selection criteria, and the scattered residence of athletes, lack of contact, etc., are secondary reasons and will not be mentioned.</p>
<p>In conclusion: Regarding innate aspects, although we are not as good as Japan, the Philippines, and other strong nations, if we can fully cultivate and restrain ourselves in acquired aspects, our performance will definitely not be so backward. I hope to witness our athletes at the 11th Far Eastern Games raising their eyebrows and exhaling, defeating foreign races, and winning the championship back, fighting for a breath of fresh air for the motherland. That is what the author prays for sincerely.</p>
<h3 id="e268">On the Issue of Students Smoking <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Jingjia</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper education news had a piece saying: "The Ministry of Education issued a circular to schools in all provinces and cities, strictly prohibiting students from smoking." This made me feel deeply emotional!</p>
<p>In recent years, cigarettes have become an extremely popular and widespread consumer product. Most young people smoke. Some people even think that not smoking is not being a modern person. Therefore, some people who don't smoke often pick up a cigarette and play with it, as if they are puffing clouds. In schools, these phenomena are extremely common.</p>
<p>Not only that, but smoking foreign goods is not enough to show off wealth. In the eyes of smoking students, the best domestic cigarettes are no match for the worst foreign cigarettes. In other words, it is better to send money abroad.</p>
<p>How terrible are these phenomena! If this continues, on the one hand, students' psychology will become increasingly bad, and on the other hand, economic leakage will be even greater. The consequences are unimaginable!</p>
<p>On this point, strictly prohibiting students from smoking is undoubtedly a benevolent policy!</p>
<p>However, doubt follows! The regulations of every school have rules prohibiting smoking, and at the same time, there is no school without smoking students! How are these contradictory phenomena produced? Moreover, on the negative side, people who smoke in society are not all from schools. Even if they don't smoke in school, they will smoke after entering society! Does it mean that they can smoke immediately after leaving student life?</p>
<p>If it is said that students are too young to smoke because it is harmful to their health. But we know that arsenic can kill old people and young people at the same time. Why are we so concerned about the health of students and so dismissive of people outside the student body?</p>
<p>The words seem too crooked, and the meaning is inevitably "distorted." However, can prohibiting students from smoking be effective with just a circular? I can say categorically, no!</p>
<p>Any circular cannot resist the power of temptation!</p>
<p>Under the call of the New Life Movement, the emergence of these circulars is inevitable. However, I ask the education authorities to pay attention to another point! Students who dance all night in dance halls, cinemas, and fancy restaurants, holding women, are filling the schools. I dare not believe that these behaviors are more noble than smoking.</p>
<p>I don't advocate smoking—although I smoke myself—and I don't object to issuing circulars strictly prohibiting students from smoking. However, I hope:</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention to student behavior that is worse than smoking.</p>
<p>(2) Improve the environment in the student world; reduce bad temptations.</p>

<p>— Yingying</p>
<p>In front of the writing desk, there is a large glass high-footed tank. It holds many small goldfish.</p>
<p>From the outside of the tank, those aquatic animals inside are so small and agile!</p>
<p>Crowding, squeezing past the shoulders of companions, and swimming past the tails of other companions!</p>
<p>They never stop for a moment; they are like small swimming</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>experts, with extremely persistent endurance!</p>
<p>Green and lush fine grass set off a pair of goldfish of the same golden color; swimming together so intimately like a pair of little lovers.</p>
<p>There is one that is all black! Only the middle of the belly has a layer of white, which is relatively longer, like an older brother in the team.</p>
<p>There is also a golden-red one, with a butterfly girl's wing-shaped tail!</p>
<p>Four adorable little companions do nothing all day but compete to learn to swim, hoping that a good ambition can be realized to become a swimmer.</p>
<p>Snowy younger brother comes home from school. First, he throws away his schoolbag and looks at his little friends to see if they are safe and lively? He also shares some of the small cakes that his mother gave him to eat.</p>
<p>He says that if they don't eat, they won't swim! If they don't swim, they won't be fun anymore.</p>
<p>The innocent little heart doesn't understand how to call death? He only knows that if they don't move, they will no longer be of interest!</p>
<p>Each time, he must see them himself before he can rest assured! Then he reviews his lessons and writes.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the fact will really come one day!</p>
<p>As usual, he came home from school. He generously scattered some of the small bread that his sister gave him into the glass tank!</p>
<p>Suddenly, he cried.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Xuexue?" Mom asked him.</p>
<p>"It's not good, Mom, the little goldfish aren't moving—they don't want to eat the sweet bread."</p>
<p>I don't know when these little lives died!</p>
<p>"Xuexue, the little goldfish are all dead! Of course, they won't eat your sweet bread."</p>
<p>"How did they die? I don't want them to die, I want them to eat the sweet bread I gave them!"</p>
<p>"If they're dead, how can they live! We'll buy a few more tomorrow, and you hide the sweet bread. Let Huahua eat these for dinner."</p>
<p>"Swallow them like that? Ah, no way. Huahua is not guilty?"</p>
<p>He hurriedly opened a cigarette case. He gently scooped the dead goldfish into the box. Teary-eyed, his eyes swollen like the protruding eyes of the dead goldfish, looking pitiful! The child's heart is the most kind—he buried those poor little lives!</p>
<h3 id="e270">The Concrete Future of Chinese Women <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Xiuying</p>
<p>After reading the article "The Future of Chinese Women" in the 19th issue of this journal, I deeply sympathize with the author, Mr. Boer, and believe that the article's arguments are much more intelligent and correct than the general empty calls for women's movement and all kinds of flamboyant propositions. Now, I will also try to write a few opinions, and if they can be connected with the previous article, then my humble opinions to female comrades are as follows:</p>
<p>First, objective facts have already shown that the so-called "women's suffrage movement" and "free love" are slogans of the past. It is true that women needed such liberation when overthrowing the old shackles of habits and systems. However, nowadays, many frivolous young men and women of the leisure class have turned "free love" into a "love of money" style of prostitution on the streets; at the same time, the meaning of "political participation movement" has become an activity phenomenon of the special class of "wives gaining status through their husbands":::::. All of this is not a sufficient warning to us that the so-called "current women's movement should change slogans"? Moreover, the following women's movement cannot but adopt a more advanced policy. Therefore, we believe that the foundation of women's equal love must be established in the process of production and labor to build life; women's political sovereignty must create their own position in the struggle to overthrow the exploiting class and all those who regard women as appendages or decorations. Only in this way can women fight for freedom and equality!</p>
<p>Second, regarding physical and mental strength, it is natural that women lack opportunities for development due to historical constraints. However, now we should train in actual operating habits. On the one hand, we must resolutely oppose the leisure class's idle and boring "promoting women's education" or flamboyant "women's health," etc., contempt, and slogans of women playing with women. Because the facts tell us that the current general education and physical education trends, at least in China under this feudal restraint and imperialist oppression, are undoubtedly a kind of clothing to decorate the ruling class, and even a kind of anesthetic to fool the public. We have seen countless female graduates of large and small schools who can neither do things for society nor take care of daily family life, and even cannot handle the necessary operations for their own lives - then, is this because their brains are subject to autocratic restrictions? Or is it that their physiques are not healthy at all? Heaven knows! They only cultivate their physical strength to specialize in efforts to make the opposite sex sensual; at the same time, they use their mental strength to cater to the masturbatory or buying and selling skills of their lovers. Therefore, in order to respect women's rights, women should now train their mental strength in understanding society and enriching knowledge! They should train their physical strength in operational skills (from factories to kitchens, they should be attentive!), only in this way can the true virtues of women be expressed.</p>
<p>Third, according to the "establishment of women's struggle standards in the objective environment" mentioned in the first point above and the "establishment of women's solid strength in subjective quality" mentioned in the second point; finally, the women's movement should be regarded as war, in strategy, all those who oppress or trample on women of the leisure class (not only men punching and kicking people, but also using power and profit to force women to marry, or rape, etc., also belong to oppression and trampling) and their systems should be regarded as enemies. All those who labor for the welfare of the public (regardless of mental or physical strength) and the goals they desire should be regarded as friendly forces, so that the task of the women's movement can be completed. This is an extremely clear path, just like the strategy of the world women's movement, in the weak Chinese ethnic group, it should overthrow the great powers and unite all the weak ethnic groups, which is a fighting formation!</p>
<p>In conclusion: The future of women has reached the forefront of social movements. The struggle for liberation is as urgent as the current actual productive forces need a new production system suitable for their own development. (Rewarded)</p>

<p>— Boer</p>
<p>A loud and long whistle, pressing, urging, driving people away. One by one, they began to roll around, like a tide, rushing in all directions, wolfishly and turbulently.</p>
<p>The ship gradually began to move, and the waves behind its stern hit countless white swirls, rolling, splashing, and clumps of water flowers, soaring into the sky.</p>
<p>With a final "woo," the ship finally left the dock, and my six months of life in H city were over.</p>
<p>For me, the journey is nothing but a boring thing. Who wants to put boredom in their liver?</p>
<p>Bored, I stood on the deck, looking at the green sky, the endless coastline, bathing in the sunlight, splashing with seawater, and the cool sea breeze swept across my face. I immediately felt an infinite sense of ease and pleasure.</p>
<p>But soon after, a lofty sense of worry still lurked deeply in my heart. The road of life is a long run without end, isn't my future as vast as the ocean?</p>
<p>For the sake of education, whipped by the iron chains of life—allow me to say it so bluntly—I must wander everywhere...</p>
<p>At this moment, I feel empty, unfamiliar, lonely, contradictory... The earth is always messy, dirty, and lifeless. I am unfamiliar with my family, and I am also unfamiliar with society. I feel that I am living alone in this cold society, and I do not feel any enthusiasm, kindness, or cooperative emotions.</p>
<p>Bearing the heavy burden of a history of trauma, I stagger through hardship, and the road is getting farther and farther.</p>
<p>Sadly, I sighed, shook my body, and wiped the small beads of seawater splashing on my face.</p>
<p>At this time, a Ph.D. in law who had just returned from the United States and voluntarily introduced himself to me patted me on the shoulder and said;</p>
<p>"Mr., aren't you very lonely? The whole of China is lonely, and it's terrible. I also regret coming back to the messed-up China."</p>
<p>"Why?" I coldly asked him his name. He opened his eyes and said;</p>
<p>"China is not good, not good. Look: dirty, messy, corrupt, despicable, barbaric... It's simply not worthy of being called a civilized country! Mr., the United States is different. They are rich in creativity, living, and everything is on track. No wonder they are a rich country and a strong people... I dare to say boldly that the United States is a paradise and China is a hell. Mr., would you believe me?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to hear you make such a judgment..."</p>
<p>"So, you don't think I'm right?"</p>
<p>To be honest with you, Mr., if China wants to be strong, it can only follow the United States. I think we must cooperate with the United States, otherwise China will never have hope."</p>
<p>I gave him a cold glance, and couldn't help but laugh secretly in my heart. I thought this was a foreign Ph.D., a university professor, one of the guides of the country's highest culture, talking nonsense. Wasn't China poisoned by people like them? So I bluntly said to him;</p>
<p>"Dr., how can you not change into a Chinese, that yellow face can never be washed off? I hope you, very much, open your eyes wide, calmly study the real China, the real situation of the world, and then make a judgment, and then discuss, but, never forget that you are also a Chinese!"</p>
<p>He hummed from his nose and said to me angrily, "You don't understand! You don't understand! You have no manners!" Then he ran away quickly.</p>
<p>Woo! The whistle sounded twice, and I also ran back to my room. My heart was still lonely, but there was some amusement.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Travel Notes and Essays <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>Following humor, travel notes and essays seem to be taking the upper hand in the literary world. If we casually flip through an American newspaper or magazine, we can find this type of article at any time; moreover, some publications even rely solely on this to make a living.</p>
<p>There are likely hardships for authors in today’s mass production of travel notes and essays. The hardship is probably due to being born in this chaotic world. They are unwilling to pledge allegiance to power (or have no way to curry favor), writing flattering articles like slaves. They are also afraid of guns and knives, daring not to openly resist and write great works that correct the world and people’s hearts. If they were to remain silent and not ask about worldly affairs, not only would they feel unhappy inside, but they would also worry about solving the problem of three meals a day. Therefore, they have to choose this path and run along with it. The trend of pure conversation in the Jin Dynasty was extremely popular for a time, and the small essays of the late Ming Dynasty were able to sweep the world, perhaps for the same reason. Living in a turbulent and uneasy China, especially in this metropolis full of coal smoke, people's spiritual lives are extremely oppressed and uncomfortable. Not having the opportunity to go to high mountains and great rivers to see scenic spots, to relax and enjoy a breath of fresh air, and to become a hermit in deep forests and famous mountains is even more impossible. Therefore, lying in a small room, reading travel notes and essays of famous people, one can also gain a moment of leisure and comfort. Quenching thirst by thinking of plums is the same principle.</p>
<p>People need a little comfort. However, will the comfort gained from these travel notes and essays cause people to become muddled and estranged from the real world? No one dares to say.</p>
<p>The trend of small essays from the late Ming Dynasty, which had been buried for two or three hundred years, now seems to have signs of revival. Originally, the Spirit School of the late Ming Dynasty, which did not force a strong interest, did not follow ancient methods, and expressed its own views without imitating the ancients, had a very correct perspective. A faithful writer must do this. Even if it is promoted now, hundreds of years later, it does not lose its original value. However, it is a pity that the current group of authors has tainted the predecessors' propositions and greatly imitated their works.</p>
<p>I remember Lu Xun saying in his article "The Crisis of Small Essays": A surviving small essay must be a dart, a throwing spear, something that can kill a bloody path to survival together with the readers. We do not not need small essays now, but we are dissatisfied with not being able to find darts and throwing spears of this kind now.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wang received our letter?" Mrs. Beiping smiled.</p>
<p>"I came here as soon as I received it. I haven't seen Junyang for three years." But in his heart he thought - he really has her! That guy who doesn't understand women!</p>
<p>"Junyang often talks about Mr. Wang, a handsome man." She laughed like a silver bell, but it was so natural, a Mrs. Beiping who could make Junyang breathe in front of urban women.</p>
<p>"Junyang is always joking, he's just kidding." He raised his body slightly to speak, but Caulmen's eyeballs were glancing at Chaplin's hair, Heifetz's nose and mouth, and the snow-white silk scarf corner on his collar in the mirror of the opposite wardrobe.</p>
<p>-- A handsome man? A group of urban women, red-lipped young ladies, dancers in high heels surrounding him, but "who would love them"! No girl has the manager of the World Trading Company Mr. Min Sun's Caulmen's eyeballs.</p>
<p>Retracting his gaze to see the other party smiling charmingly, he glanced at the corner of the silk scarf on his collar again, smoking a cigarette, maintaining a gentleman's attitude.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, is something wrong?" Mrs. Beiping misunderstood.</p>
<p>"No!" Slightly shaking Chaplin's hair, expressing such politeness, "Junyang is probably coming back soon, right?"</p>
<p>"He went to find a few friends, maybe to the World Trading Company. He knows Mr. Wang has arrived here. He will definitely come back!"</p>
<p>When the second cigarette was offered warmly, there was a slight knock on the door outside.</p>
<p>"Junyang is back." Min Sun almost lost his gentlemanly demeanor and jumped up.</p>
<p>Mrs. Beiping walked with light steps, fluttering like a goddess. Opening the door, a waiter in white uniform said humbly:</p>
<p>"Madam, there's a phone call."</p>
<p>Mrs. Beiping turned around, "Mr. Wang, please wait a moment."</p>
<p>"Please go ahead."</p>
<p>Standing up to see Mrs. Beiping out the door, Min Sun paced in the room. He saw a handsome man walking everywhere in the room: Chaplin's hair, Caulmen's eyeballs, Heifetz's nose and mouth, and the snow-white silk scarf corner.</p>
<p>-- That guy, tricking a beautiful woman back to Shanghai, he really has it! But thinking of his waving "I'm heartbroken!" he couldn't help but smile in a Heifetz style; he immediately restrained his smile as if his secret had been discovered, straightened his tie in the mirror, and returned to his original seat, sitting upright with such politeness.</p>
<p>In front of Mrs. Beiping, he discovered his own insignificance.</p>
<p>The sound of disciplined high-heeled leather shoes approached the door, the lady was obviously a skilled dancer. - That guy must have come from sitting in cafes, right?</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, what a joke! Junyang said he was held back by friends and couldn't get away; I said isn't Mr. Wang your friend? People have been here for half a day, there must be something going on!"</p>

<h3 id="e275">The Dismissal Incident of Renowned Soviet Film Director Room Shocks the Soviet Film Industry <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Zhi</p>
<p>On March 19 of this year, the Soviet People's Committee's Film Industry Main Affairs Bureau swiftly and decisively dismissed A.M. Room, a first-class Soviet director, from his position in the film industry. At the same time, it was decided to hand him over to the inquiry committee for deliberation. This incident shocked the entire Soviet film industry, and its impact even spread to countries around the world. In the Soviet Union, there are currently only five technicians with the honor of first-class director: (1) Eisenstein (K.S.E.) of "Battleship Potemkin" and "The Old and the New," (2) Ms. Schub of "Four Women" (Esther Svhub), (4) Ermler of "Fragment of an Empire" and "Counterplan," and Room, whom we are going to talk about here, who became famous with "The Great Undertaking." In the Soviet Union, first-class directors have the greatest authority and reputation. They can choose scripts according to their own wishes and freely produce films. Therefore, the dismissal of a first-class director is undoubtedly a major event in the Soviet film industry this year. In the early 1920s, Room successively produced famous works such as "Death Bay," "The Spy," and "Third Meshchanskaya Street." "Bed and Sofa" is his representative successful work. In 1930, he completed the Soviet Union's first and also the greatest artistic sound film "The Great Undertaking." His reputation and the momentum of his new talent were not inferior to Pudovkin and Eisenstein. The reason for this dismissal was lax work and waste of public funds. Since "The Great Undertaking," he had been resting for more than two years. Until February 1933, he began planning a new work. Initially, it was scheduled to be prepared from February to May, and filming would be completed from May to the following May. However, during this period, Room never decided on a filming plan, never wrote a complete filming script, and worked with a vague and directionless attitude. As of February 1 of this year, out of the planned production cost of 600,000 rubles, a total of 509,000 rubles had been spent, while only 5% of the entire film had been completed. Therefore, the 17th Congress of the Soviet Party determined that Room's behavior was bureaucratic contempt of responsibility, which could not be tolerated during the second Five-Year Plan's shock process. It was decided to revoke his position and hand him over for punishment as a warning to all film practitioners. On March 19, the above decision was announced in the name of Shumyatsky, Chairman of the Main Affairs Bureau. At the same time, it was also decided that Shvinnikov, Director of Artistic Production of the Moscow Film Studio, was negligent in supervision, and Metalnikov, Director of the Moscow Combined Film Factory, was inept in handling affairs, and they were given reprimands. The Room incident is quite similar to the Pudovkin reprimand incident last year. Because Pudovkin began filming the new film "Deserter" the year before last. This film was based on the German workers' movement. Later, due to the drastic changes in the objective situation in Germany, the content was repeatedly reshot, so that the original film consumed 400,000 feet, and the production date was extended to more than two years. After the film was made, although it had unique artistic qualities, it had quite a few errors in its point of view. Therefore, in order to clarify responsibility, the Film Industry Main Affairs Bureau also imposed a reprimand. From the above two incidents, we can know the organization and control of the Soviet film industry, as well as the poignant and tragic emotions of film practitioners in the second Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e276">After Seeing "Good Night" <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Benxi</p>
<p>It has great significance, why use eroticism?</p>
<p>The actors all have considerable achievements and are beyond reproach.</p>
<p>Tan Ying plays the young widow with profound expressions, bringing to life a young girl who, although under the oppression of the old etiquette, has a quiet heart that seeks the nourishment of spring. Tan Ying's achievements after changing her style far exceed her previous works. However, her willow-like eyebrows and permed hair are incompatible with the identity of the character in the play. Although this issue has been corrected many times, it is ultimately not noticed by the production authorities. The several erotic scenes also feel unnecessary. A great work has its own great significance, why use eroticism?</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that if works such as "Pear Blossoms in the Rain" and "Good Night" can be used with sound, it will further enhance the emotions in the play. Although the subtitles of this film are also concise and moving, they are not as strong as sound.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Thoughts After Seeing "Good Night" <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Meilan</p>
<p>A Woman's Cry</p>
<p>After watching this film, I couldn't help but have a feeling.</p>
<p>Does etiquette really devour people? I have doubted this question for many years. Now, in "Good Night," it has very clearly answered me. It says: "Etiquette is going to eat people, especially us women."</p>
<p>Under the principle of monogamy, husband and wife should mutually maintain chastity. If the wife dies, the husband remarries. Then, if the husband dies, the wife remarries, it is undoubtedly a proper and appropriate thing. However, our country's so-called etiquette does not allow it. It only allows a man to remarry after his wife dies, but a woman cannot remarry after her husband dies. She should observe chastity for her deceased husband. In order to reward such chaste women, chastity arches are produced. May I ask, what is the significance of this chastity? This is obviously to destroy us women. Under this cruel and inhumane system, I don't know how many tens of millions of my female compatriots' lives have been devoured over the years. Under the solemn and sacred chastity arches recognized by a group of people, I don't know how many lively souls of my female compatriots have been suppressed. What a tragic and unjust thing this is!</p>
<p>Now is the time for us to rise up and resist. For the sake of our own future happiness, we can no longer succumb to this inhumane and unreasonable system. We should unite and fight this man-eating etiquette, to melee. We must use the greatest courage to defeat her, to redeem our freedom and happiness.</p>
<p>Female compatriots, it is useless to wipe tears with silk handkerchiefs after watching "Good Night"!</p>
<h3 id="e278">Norma Shearer's masterpiece "The Divorcee" - Starting Thursday at the Grand Theater <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<h3 id="e279">Homeless Sacrifice <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Si Tong</p>
<p>Written after watching "Good Night"</p>
<p>In fact, feudal forces and old etiquette are still deeply rooted. They bind the hearts of many people, destroy and bury many precious lives. Although since the May Fourth Movement, a part of society has been liberated (in fact, it is just replacing feudal forces and old etiquette with decadence, romance, and carnal desire... It is still far from liberation, which is most heartbreaking.) But except for a few big cities and a few places with open customs, most compatriots are still groaning under this pressure. Therefore, the anti-feudal movement should continue to be carried out to seek the final victory and move towards a bright future. The appearance of "Good Night" is precisely to inject a shot of morphine into the struggling people. We cannot say that its intention has lost the spirit of the times. This is a point that should be clearly recognized.</p>
<p>However, the final result in this film is not satisfactory. Zhu Ying gave twelve points of sympathy to Yun Lin's environment, and repeatedly said "rescue her from the fire pit" and "break the shackles of etiquette"...; Yun Lin and her grandmother Liu Jiemu disappeared their youth under various pressures; and the descriptions of the clan chief, villains, and hypocrites, and the exposure of crimes, etc.; in the end, they can only give them minor verbal punishments, and Liu Jiemu even sacrificed herself, which is beyond the audience's expectations and makes people feel unfair. In this way, hypocrites and thugs get victory instead, and the weak are still weak in the end. It fails to indicate a clear path to the countless Liu Jiemu and Yun Lin now. Therefore, Liu Jiemu's sacrifice and Yun Lin's lack of belonging only give people more material for a sigh.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Written after watching "Two Against One" <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Huang</p>
<p>If you have seen "Sisters," and then go to see "Two Against One," then you must shout that you have been wronged, and say that Mingxing became rich and then messed things up.</p>
<p>Because the consciousness of this film is fundamentally wrong. As for the football field, it is messed up, and the confusion when kicking the ball is the worst.</p>
<p>As for the actors, there is really no place to show their strengths, and they are not very hardworking. Wang Xianzhai and others are completely disappointing.</p>
<p>There are also a few actresses who are too contrived, so they are also very disappointing.</p>
<p>In short, this film is the worst production of Mingxing this year, far worse than "Sisters." It is hoped that the Mingxing authorities will carefully investigate future productions, otherwise their credibility will be lost.</p>
<h3 id="e281">"Wine, Sex, Wealth, and Temper" Grand Hotel <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>All ten interior scenes of Lianhua Second Factory's new film "Wine, Sex, Wealth, and Temper" can be said to be great. Recently, the interior scene of the corridor on the upper floor of the hotel, which is being filmed, is only the so-called passing scene in the play. However, under the Lianhua production principle of not being sloppy, "the set with not many shots was built in six days and nights of continuous work, covering an area of more than fifty square feet. The elevators, escalators, rooms, and corridors are all completely lifelike, and the style and decoration are even more modernized. It is said that when designing this set, set designer Liu Jin San Jun visited more than a dozen new-style hotels in Shanghai and consulted many architectural drawings for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e282">"Rouge and Iron Blood" Premieres Today <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Tianyi Film Company's recent production "Rouge and Iron Blood" stars Wang Yuanlong, Fan Xuepeng, Tang Jie, Lu Jianfen, Wang Huijuan, Xiao Zhengzhong, Shu Lijuan, Wu Yixiao, and others. The entire play is full of tension and sorrow. Tianyi Company once selected this film to participate in this year's National Domestic Film Competition. Now, the film is scheduled to be released at the Beijing Grand Theater on the 23rd of this month. At that time, there will be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Letter to Mr. Guo Jilong: Thank you for inquiring about the dates of the film reviews of "Life" and "Return." According to our investigation, they were published on February 4 and February 19, respectively. We are specifically replying. Since you are a patron of this publication, please keep it after reading it in the future.</p>

<p>— Shu Ming</p>
<p>The black people's song and dance program in Heaven is very extensive. After Al finished his own singing, he hurried to see Inez. Inez was crying in her dressing room. She said that Harry must have been killed by her. Al laughed at her and said she was crazy. Harry was just hurt, and he has already gone home with Captain Flynn. By tomorrow, everything will be fine. As he spoke, he gently put a shawl around her shoulders, thinking about how to comfort her later and make her forget about Harry. His heart was full of hope. He wanted to come back after everything was over and tell her how much he loved her. He wanted to take her home himself. But when he went out for a while, when he came back, Tommy was already in Inez's dressing room. Tommy saw Al and quickly called him in. Al went in, but seeing that the two of them were both younger than him and showing a sense of light pity and affection, he couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed. He saw that Inez's face was still covered with a lot of makeup oil, so he said: "Be careful of the oil on your face, it will stick you together." When Inez heard this, she handed a towel to Tommy. Tommy quickly took it and happily wiped the oil on her face for her. While wiping, he said: "Honey, isn't this the same as before?" He also explained to Al: "I always wiped the oil on her face before. It's been a long time since I wiped it."</p>
<p>Al saw that expression and couldn't help but feel uncomfortable, so he said to Inez: "I'll take you home in a while. Breathe some fresh air on the road, and you'll definitely feel better." But they were silent for a while, and then Inez said: "Okay, you are too good to me." Tommy stood up and said: "Good is good, but, Al, I have composed a new song and want to play it for her. Let me take her back." Inez unknowingly took Tommy's hand. Al pretended not to care and said: "That's fine too." Inez said: "Walk with us, okay?" Tommy also said: "That's great, you come and walk with us." Al smiled. His face was black because he hadn't taken off his makeup yet, covering the pain in his heart, because his hopes were all in vain now. He understood in his heart that the two young people were pitying him, an old man, and adding kindness. But he still pretended to be nonchalant and smiled: "Sitting and listening to two children singing mountain songs? I can't do it." He walked towards the door. He said: "I wish you happiness." This was really his sincere blessing, but unknowingly his shoulders slumped down.</p>
<p>A night of singing and dancing was over. The tables were empty. The red and green streamers were broken. The flowers in the bottles were dry. A tired opera singer was wiping off some of the black oil left on his face. He was the last one to walk out of the Wonder Bar. The lights in the hotel were extinguished one by one, revealing the gradually brightening fish-belly white of the East. A newsboy was already shouting extras. Al bit his lip and waved to the newsboy. He bought an extra. When he opened the newspaper, his heart was pounding and beating unevenly. Then he took a deep breath. Nothing happened. Inez was fine. But he shouldn't let her know. The headline on the newspaper was: "Captain Flynn and famous dancer Harry died tragically in a car accident." (End)</p>
