<p>（一）軍縮對策、日政府對於海軍會議努力實現日本澈底的大軍縮案、同時請求美國諒解、以期會議圓滿成立、然如情形變化、則臨時採用適當辦法、</p>
<p>（二）通商對策、根據日美合作精神、極力維持日美通商現狀、</p>
<p>（三）排日問題、美國亞里索那省、排斥日僑農民問題、對於日美外交有致惡影響可能性、日政府信賴美政府希望早時解决本問題、然情形惡化、則由中央政府用外交手段處理之、</p>

<p>根本方針、日美間從來無、重大利害之對立、足爲戰爭之原因者、確信能充分舉恊和親善之實、故一切之問題、以和平手段處理解决、爲根本方針、</p>
<p>軍縮問題、帝國政府始終主張廢棄旣存華府條約、而提出公正妥當之實質的軍縮案以代之、以確保國際間之和平、爲根本目的、</p>
<p>滿洲問題、「滿洲國」名實均爲獨立之國、現正充分發展、所謂「滿洲國」問題之解决、在於列國率直承認此現實而已、</p>
<p>中國問題、帝國政府、特别關心在中國之特殊利害、已屢次聲名、今後仍根據此項信念、向確保遠東和平邁進、極期待美國政府精神的支持、</p>
<p>通商問題、兩國在經濟方面有有無相通之關係、今若仍本此友好精神、以增進日美相互之通商利益爲愈、</p>
<p>移民問題、排日移民法案、爲帝國政府所深引爲遺慽者、如亞里索那州之事件極感不滿、望美國官廳以適切有効之取締、從速圓滿解决、並望充分取締、</p>

<p>大局顯轉惡化、加泰隆之外省刻仍在叛黨之掌握、匿於吉瓊東面羣山中之叛黨見由飛機指導軍艦發砲轟之、衆信社會黨將於今夜大舉實行暴力政變鐵路總罷工將於明日實現、屬於全國勞工聯合會之無政府黨現亦贊助社會黨發起之罷工運動、此項運動現已延至無政府黨佔强大勢力之安杜魯西亞以故政府益增困難今日内閣正在開會、大約將决議下令召集第一第二軍之後備兵以應付嚴重之時局、如果出此、則全國男子之在三十九歲以下者均須入伍、</p>
<p>法西斯黨領袖里夫拉、卽已故西班牙狄克推多之子、今日晋謁總理勒樂、願以其黨徒六萬人爲其馳驅、</p>
<p>今晚京中之戰事、共死七人、内有著名某咖啡館之侍者者兩人、當時彈雨横射索爾大街、郵政局之玻璃窗全遭擊碎、當道現恐人民因糧食缺之、結衆槍店、城中現無麵粉麵包芋薯、有許多居民僅賴牛奶粉度活、</p>
<p>政府深慮鐵路總罷工將於明日實現、故作先發制人之計、於各鐵路實行軍治、召集所有鐵路後備人員服務、鐵路織工至是當然須受軍法部勒、如稍抗命、卽有立時槍决之虞、</p>
<p>據最近消息、阿斯特里亞礦區之形勢仍不見佳、罷工者挾有軍械、恐尙有砲隊也、現電話綫均被割斷、道路被拆毁、其地崎嶇多山進兵甚爲困難、</p>

<p>都有狠大的進步、可知各軍民長官、大家都能共同努力、來盡自已的職　、照武漢的現狀來推察國家的前途、一定是有狠大的希望、一定可以達到我們救國的目的、這一點是兄弟覺得非常之安慰的不過、無論什麽事業、尤其是政治上的事情、决不是一朝一夕所能希望有大的成功的、要能做出大事業來、一定要能够本着「自强不息」的精神、繼續不斷的努力、一方面日新又新的進取、一方面日積月累的增益、這樣政治上才能根本的改造起來、然後政治上一切的基礎、才能照我們主義的目標、一天一天建設起來、現在武漢方面、政治上的基礎、雖然還没有狠穩固的建設起來、但是初步的規模、可以説已經有了、我們旣的了這樣一個規模、只要大家在精神上、能一天天有進步、以後我相信無論政</p>
<p>治·軍事·社會·敎青·各方面、一切改革和建設的事業、一定能够同時並進、一定可以奠定狠緊實的基礎、來完成我們大家所負救國的使命、關於湖北政治的設施、我在民國二十一年快要離開武漢的時候、曾經頒訂整理湖北政治綱要十八條、現在過了兩年、根據這個綱要來檢查一下、許多事情、雖已舉辦、有狠大的進步和成效、但是還有許多事没有辦到、甚至根本還没有舉辦、其實綱要中所　的事情、都是最急切、最簡易的初步設施、現在過了兩年、還没有完全辦到、這一點黨然是我頒訂綱要的人、感覺非常之慚愧的、因此今天我再要將這十八條綱要唸　、希望今後大家能照此共同努力、務求完全實現、「一、實施行政督察專員制度、務令完全得以行使其職權、愼重各縣縣長及公安局長人選、應切實考績、加以保障、並厲行獎　條例、</p>
<p>三、各縣現有之警察、及地方自衛之保安隊、應即嚴加整理、改善其編制、核實其名額、確定其餉源、並保障其公有或私有槍枝、切實加以訓</p>
<p>練、對於政治常識、及國術科目、尤應特别注重、四、各縣保安隊及其他地方目衛團隊、經整理後、應規定各縣壯丁常備預備後備服役期限、並劃分管區、以寄内政於軍令、由保安處擬具實施方案、分期進行、其第一期之整理工作、應於二十二年三月完成、五、依編查保甲户口條例、實行編查保甲户口、並須遵照編查限期進度表之規定、依限編查完竣、遇有特别情形、確不能依限辦理者、得據實呈明候核、酌爲展期、但最遲不得逾二十二年三月、全省必須一律辦竣、並應於同年五月赴至九月止、全省亦復查一次、六、</p>
<p>除湖北省下政府及漢口市政府之預算、衆經核定外、全省各縣政府扩其附屬關、一切地方經費之收支、應即編造止式預算、呈由財政廳轉陳核定、公佈施行、限明年二月起一律依照新預算實施、七、省農民銀行及各縣信用合作社之設立、限二十三年三月初步完成、八、清文土地、預定五年完成、惟二十二年一年間之初步計劃、應儘先規定、九、各財政機關應立即實施會計制度、十、各級財務人員、須取具保證、由主管機關隨時切實監察、如有營私舞弊情事、應切實追賠、盡法懲治、十一、省公路、暫出建設廳擬具一年内築路計劃分期進行、第一期工作、應於二十二年三月完成、十二、湖北堤防水利工程、應移歸全國經濟委員會統籌計劃、並責成該會所屬之江漢工程局專責曾理、以省胼枝、而杜冒溢、十三、湖北各縣中、尤其被匪區内、除依土地處理條例及農村合作社條例、努力農村復與之工作外、應選檡適當地區哨創辦集團農塲、試行最新耕作及管理方法十四、中小學敎育、應在各種課程中、激　與生之民族意識、餈成爲國　牲之精神、十五、小學及初中、應　　訓練　子軍、十六、初中以上之學校、應注重軍　敎育、並使學生生活軍隊化、十七、平民識字運動、由敎青廳規定一年計劃、先從漢實行、十八、各級司法機關、對於訴讼　案、應限期清理完竣、嗣後民刑訴訟、應依法定程序、敢多不得逾一個月了結、以免民衆因訟受累」、當時所訂整理湖北政治綱要、就是這十八條、其中有幾件狠　要的事情、如編查保甲户口、濟丈土地、編造各縣地方正式預算、推行各縣合作事業、創辦集團農塲、這幾項、現在或是没有辦好、或是尙未開始舉辦、希望今後能够積　舉辦、伜　先完成才好不　是各民政長官　　力來做、凡是　區各高級軍官、對於所駐區域以内一切政治上的設施也要如此實行、和地方民政長官通同合作、切實照着綱要來做、不要以爲道些事、是專屬民政範圍、帶乓官可以不管、必要如此政治與軍事、才能恊同推進、勦匪才能澈底成功、各地方才有眞正清明之一日、這是希望各位軍民長官、今後要共同努力、切實做到整理湖北政治綱要中所規定的事情的一點意思、其次、這幾天觀察的結果、雖然漢在各方面、都有狠大的進步、但是無論政治軍事、市政軍政任何方面、有幾點仍舊要特别注意的、第一、我們無論要做一件什麽事、必須注事實在、表裹如一、不可只講一個表面的形式、即如就道路的整潔而言、現在各處的道路一般都比較整潔、但是如果看道路兩旁的僻處、仍就不免有髒的地方、什麽紙屑垃圾、都是隨便亂散、又如中國各地普通各機關的情形、表面看去、大體是整潔、但是你如果走進去看一看厨房、再看看厠所、狠多都是髒得不堪、這些最容易發生微菌傳染疾病的地方、一般只顧形式不重實質的人、就不知道注意、這種積習、實在是中國人一般的老毛病、即如普通一個家庭　掃地、往往就只婦房子中关間一塊地方、其餘墻脚上門角裹、這種地方、永久也不去洒掃、中國人家庭的生活、就如此推而至於社會上、政治上切的事情、也莫不相同、所以我今天要特别提出這一點來、和大家講一講、要請大家有則改之、無則加勉、以後無論什麽事情、要注重實在你們做主管長官的人、一定要對於最容易發生弊病、而他人最不經意、而實在最要緊的地方、</p>
<p>格外留心整頓、這是我們辦事的一個根本要訣、</p>
<p>無論政治上、軍事上、社會上、都是一樣、比方講帶軍隊、就不單只知道每天出出操、上上課、或是普通查一查内務而已、必須切它實注意經理衛生各方面的事情、尤其是厠所厨房這些地方、格外要勤於檢查才好、至於警察廳管的事情、格外複雜、一切格外要實事求是才行、即就整潔一項而論、你們看現在武漢所有的公安局和崗位所在附近的地方、是不是都已澈底、達到了整潔的要求、希望你們做主管長官的人、格外要注意才好、這是講辦事要力求實在、第二我們一切的設施、以後不僅要注意都市、而且更加要注意到鄉村僻巷、比方講現在武漢各處的道路狠整潔、新生活軍動已經一步步見諸實行、只要大家以後能繼續不斷的努力、不怕辦不好、但是我們的工作、不是只將都市改進了就算事、要知道都市的事情、不過是我們全部工作百分之一二的事情、</p>
<p>其餘尙有百分之九十八·九十九的事情、都在各縣地方和鄉村裹面、現在湖北各縣縣城、和各處農村的情形怎樣呢、據我沿遂視察所得、一切無秩序、不整潔的情形、不僅和民國二十一年以前的情形差不多、而且和三四十年以前都没有兩樣、可以説毫無進步、不必講各地的情形、　就武漢來講、現在城市裹面、無不論道路·公圍·警政財政·敎青·都進步、形式上都狠有可觀、但是只要走到比較遠一點的、如口和劉家廟一帶地方、窮苦的民衆、和破敗的茅棚、就特别多、雖然有一條馬路通了、但是附近的街道仍舊没有　　、陰溝和其他關於公共衛生、社會敎育等極種有益於一般貧苦民衆有設備一點也没有注意、殊不知這些地方、如果你不注意、就容易發生各種的毛病、如此、雖然都市裹弄得狠好、也不會有完滿的成效、而且不是有知　的人、無論中外、他要看我們政治、决不會只注意都市裹面的設施、一定要格外注意你對於鄉村的設施如何、對於一般貧苦民衆的福利注意不注意、昨天我就遇見兩個外國人、在那邊視察、他一看就知道中國政府做事、只集中都市的馬路、不注重市外的鄉村不能爲一般貧苦的民衆謀利、還有我們現在所做的、新生活運動、也不是只注意改良都市裹面一般人的生活、目的是要使全國國民、自　都大埠、以至窮鄉僻壤、無論男女、老幼·貧富·的生活、都要能普遍的改進、使能達到整齊」「　潔」「簡單」「樸素」「迅速」「確實」諸條件、合乎禮義　　的精神、所以大家以後對於鄉村和一般最窮苦最骯髒的地方、一定要特别注意、想種種方法先來改良、多爲一般最貧苦的民「衆造福、這是希望大家今後要特别注意的第二點、第三、我們現在做事、一定要目上至下、以勤勞的精神補物質之不是、現在一般人無論什麽事、動不動就先要錢、説没有錢就不能做、這種説法、一般以爲不無道理、實在是不對的、普通許多的事情、並不是一定要錢、才可以做、即如要使一個地方整潔、並不一定要建築下水道就是簡單的挖明溝排洩活水也行、這件事不一定是要錢才能辦、就由我們警察劃一條綫、來責成地方保甲長、或街長等、分由各户負責挖成、</p>
<p>這樣不是成功了嗎、就是民衆没有工作器具、由我們警察局備、點借給他們應用、也不費什麽錢、又如上兩個星期、我在湖口等縣走過一個地方、很多很可用的　頭石條亂擺着、縣政府一點也不注意整理、問他的時候、他就説没有錢、無從着乎、其實這些事情、何當需要什麽錢、只要縣長稍微注意到、責成各村鎭保甲長指導一般民衆費點勞力、整頓一下、就不知有幾多國物可以利用、幾多不整潔的地方可以整潔起來、諸如此類、都是們中國人自上至下偷情的痼疾、今後要澈底改過來才好、要曉独我們革命黨員的本領、就是要能以身作則、領導一般民衆、以勤苦耐勞的精神、來補救我們物質之不足、我們要没有金錢、也能做好事情、更要曉得、土地就是金錢、人民的勞力、更是生産的資源、我們只要能想法子盡其地利、來增加生産、用其民力來改造社會、就不要金錢、而可做成種的事業、管子所講的「以死敎民强、以勞敎民富」、上一名就是説我們要使國家和一般民衆羆够强起來、就要使他明生死之大義、打破生死關頭、能够養成其勇於爲國犠牲的精神、下一句就是要使民衆習勞、所以「民生在勤」的意思、就政府而言、就是要能善於利用民力、來增進民衆本身的福利的意思、現在一般人、以爲要做一件事業、必先要金錢、就要想方法、如何來捐欵抽税、剝削民衆、殊不知一個人如果事事非錢莫辦、這個人一定　錢也不能做什麽事、何况要向民衆來剝削金錢、這是要剝削完的、要亡國的、惟有善用民　的勞力、來增進民衆本身的利益、才是革命建設的正道、唯有善用勞力、才是惠而不費、取之不盡、亦惟有用以增進民衆本身福利、才會勞而不怨、用之不竭、所以南昌行營那方面、曾有一個通令、規定每個壯丁每年要爲國家做三天工、</p>
<p>如果道個辦法、能够普遍實行的話、每縣除老幼及婦女以外、平均以五萬壯丁來計算、每縣每年就有十五萬的義務勞工、只要政府能以合理的計劃來利用、無論是用於修堤、濬河·築路·不是</p>

<p>都有很大的工程可以完成　、這樣徵工的辦法、</p>
<p>起初兩三年、或許遠要政府强迫、幾年以後、人民得了實益、成了習慣黨然要信賴政府、不待政府强迫、而能自動的榮於爲國家、爲社會公益的事　來出力、如此年年繼續下去、還有什麽建設事業不能成功、一般國民、那裹還有不富足的的道理、這「以勞敎民富」的道理、古人早已告訴我們、只怪現在一般人不能體會實行、所以無論什麽事、總是説没有錢就不能做、所心今天兄弟特别提一提、此外還有一點意思要補充的、就是我們利用民力、一定要配置得法、調理適當、對於利用的地點時閒和工作、都要斟酌完善、並且要研究管理和利用的方法、使民力不僅不致濫用浪費、而月能發生最大的效果、即於就利用民力的地方而言、大概以用於本地爲原則、什麽地方的事情、就在什麽地方徵工、什麽地方徵到的勞工、就用於有益於什麽地方的事業、必須如此、然後民衆的勞力、才能作最有效的利用、並且能使一般民衆勞而不怨、以上所講　一做事要力求實在、表　如一、第二、一切政治設施、要注重鄉村、要爲一般平民造福、第三要上下一致、以勤勞的精神助物質之不足、就是今天兄弟特别要向大家貢獻的幾點意思、也可以説是這次到武漢來的感思、其餘的話、一時也講不盡、</p>
<p>總希望大家能體會我講今天所講的意思、遵照整理湖北政治綱要所規定的項目、切實研究、共同努力來做、現在已有了這個規模、以後一定能够一天比一天更有進步、希望湖北能建設一個</p>
<p>强固的救國基礎、切盼大家努力、並祝各位健康、一云云、</p>

<p>匪軍總崩潰的徵象</p>
<p>南昌通訊、國軍於雷撥嶺之役、在擊斃僞三師營長張勝身際搜獲匪首彭德懷之僞訓令一件、其中叙述僞官兵投誠報密所受影響、與匪軍解體、均無門志各節、足</p>
<p>體其離總崩潰之期、當屬不遠、茲爲關心剿匪者明瞭匪軍内部眞象、特摘錄僞訓令原文數節如下、（一）軍團首長、（彭匪自稱）於廿六晚就正確估量敵（指國軍以後同）情、而發出了廿七日的作戰命令、廿七晚由兩次電話來補足這命令、規定了四時前、完了戰門準備、并規定了不斷接敵偵察和觀察哨的動作、然而各部通夜没有關於敵人接近的報告、並且十四團三營進入陣地後、卸下裝具睡覺、右側陣地只派丁四個步哨、突繫隊在掩壕内被</p>
<p>敵人投入手溜彈的爆炸聲、方從夢中驚走、團屬機槍、根本没有進入陣地、團的第二梯隊還在屋外出操、被敵人枹彈和飛機投彈、將部隊攔阻、增加不上、十三師卅九團陣地、只一小哨、面没有守兵、</p>
<p>這些嚴重的鬆懈和疏忽、便給了敵人襲取的機會、因此十四團三營陣地未響槍、</p>
<p>便被敵人閉塞了、堡壘的咽喉部、堅固工事、只卅分鐘便完全送給敵人、（二）敵人從十四團與卅九團接合部之大嶺格襲入、</p>
<p>五師因急求卅九團的援助時、才發覺卅九團陣地内根本没人、保護山危急的時候、十二團二營營長欲向比鄰求援時、乃不知比鄰部隊所在、保護山失守已久、敵將威脅萬年亭的右側、而十三團尙未知右翼的情况、尤其是敵人到達陣地前、突擊隊不出繫、（三）蠟燭形守備隊的降敵份子、將蠟燭形的蔭蔽機關槍窖和裝置的地雷、告知了敵人、而使敵人的飛機在開始進攻時、便將機關槍窖炸燬、地雷也很容易被敵破壞了、大嶺格降敵排長將左冀卅九團陣地空虚和接合部警戒薄弱、</p>
<p>告知了敵人、并引導敵人向此變擊、」按匪軍官兵自經我迭次圍剿後、深感切身物質痛苦、與數年盲從實行共産之經騐、</p>
<p>深知不適合於我國國情、均經覺悟、惟因</p>
<p>處於匪黨殘忍監視之下、無隙擺脱、故每乘國軍進展接近時、則紛紛携械投誠、而匪首等猶復聵聵、不自省察、妄心屢次失敗、歸咎於匪軍各部疏懈、欲籍一紙令</p>

<p>章　若講·</p>
<p>丨在中華職業敎育社丨</p>
<p>緒言丨今天承中華職業敎育社邀請兄弟到此講演、得與諸位相聚一堂、共同研究、甚爲愉快、今天雨下得很大、一天未停、諸位冒雨來此、這種精神、尤令見弟欣佩、</p>
<p>今天的講題、共分九節、但是兄弟的演講據以前在靑年會以及各大學演講的經騐來看、</p>
<p>每次總要講兩三小時、這個題目、内容更爲複雜、恐非今天規定的時間、所能充分發揮、還要希望各位自已再去研究、</p>
<p>一，講題之由來、我今天所以要講這　題目、是以我一貫的中心思想做基礎的、我不敢自命不凡、學着孔子説、「吾道」以貫之、」但我自已很相信、我自已的確有一個一貫的思想、這貫的思想、就是民族主義、兄弟自已天天、或者可以説是時時刻刻、無論是求學、做文、作事的時候、或者回到家庭的時候、我都是一刻不忘我們的民族、兄弟可以説是一個澈頭尾澈的民族主義熱烈的信仰者、因此我無論講那一種束西、無論研究那一種學問、無論那一種問題的時候、我的出發點與　结點、都是以民族爲前提的、這是我要講這個題目的最初原因、治學的方法、自然應當一本科學的精神、冷靜客觀的態度、我自已是研究政治、特别是研究公法學的、</p>
<p>可是我在研究專門學問的時候、總是帶一點感情在裏頭、本來一個專門學者、應該有科學的理智的頭腦、不能參雜個人的感情、情感的衝動是治學的人所不能有的、但是兄弟何以要明知故犯呢、道裏的理由很多、非一言能盡、簡單的講、</p>
<p>我是主張情感與理智、應該平衡發展的、所以我無綸講那一種問題、都是帶着濃厚熱烈的情感、</p>
<p>如我研究憲法、也帶了民族主義的精神與情感、去年在大公報上我曾作一篇民族與憲法的論文、我那種理論、恐怕是世界那一國的憲法學裏所没有的、這也是因爲受了我一貫的思想的影鄕、這樣講學問、人家也許會　笑我、説、你什麽都要變成民族化了、你的學問還成什麽東西呢、其實、我們所以要求學問、我們所貴乎有學問者、無非是要把他來貢獻給我們的民族、來維持與推進民族悠久偉大的生命、離開了民族的利益、就没有學問的價値、離開了民族生存的基礎、創造不了我們學問的系統、因此我自已很堅决的相信自已、我求學、我做事、我在無論那一個地方説話、或在房間裏作文章、都不應離開了這一個所謂民族生命的基礎、這是我們研究學問的人所應該大家勉勵自已的、我今天一方面固然説明題目的由來、我一方面還委誠懇的勸各位、要本着這種精神、去充實各人的智識能力、去發揚我們中華民族的文化、挽救目前民族的厄運、尤其是在這樣嚴重的國難時期、我們讀書人所負的使命、應當是特别的重大、</p>
<p>二，民族復興與「力」的關係、前幾天有一個朋友從北平來、他是在北平一個大報館做主筆、同時他是北平各六學的名敎授、也是我在歐洲的一個很好的同學、同他講到復興民族的問題、他説、「我覺得民族復興、是一個「力」的問題、政治也是「力」我們怎樣可以運用這「力」、來推動政治、復興民族、這是我們目前應該注的意大問題、」我就跟着接下去反問他説、「那麽這種「力」在那裏呢、」這一點就是我要創造、自力主義「的起點、國難以來、國内的與論及民氣、都狠激昂、很慷慨、很熱烈、在這許多激昂慷慨的與論和民氣之中、我們固然也可以找到許多有價値的値得我們欣佩的意見同理論、可是有一部份、我們却不能否認它是失之於空洞、失之於虚浮、我想這就是因爲一般人受了直覺的衝動、而没有加以冷靜的理智的考慮的原故、我以理智和情感就不得平衡、因此我們到處看見的聽見的、都是一種單純直覺衝動的理論與文章、這種理論文章、實際上是不能救民族的、　如一般人祇是在口頭上主張抗日救國、而實際上却毫不凖備、他們這種理論、在表面上誰能説一個「不」</p>
<p>字、但是我們要問、抗日的「力」量、究竟在何處呢、我們的國防到底有没有鞏固呢、無論是民衆方面、政府方面、種方面、我們有抗日的實力嗎、儘管慷慨激昂的在口頭上講抗日、儘管一時一刻不忘的在心理上要抗日、而實際上、我們到底有没有力量去抗日、有没有辦法去抗日、他們却一概不問、一概不研究、一概不凖備、祇是逞着情感、唱徒快人意的、不負責任的高調、更痛心的、還有少數人的目的、祇在表面的激昂、去　民衆的歡心祇在　緣時會、出他個人的風頭、</p>
<p>目前我們中國的投機份子實在太多、固然做官有投機、就是做愛國運動也有投機的、逞着國難的關頭、説幾句不負責任的徒快人心的話、使大家擁護他、利用這力量使他自已能得到地位、而發展他自已的前途和私慾、這種言行不一、欺騙民衆的役機份子、是不能救國的、或者可説是國家的罪人、記得兄弟在九一八以後、有一次大家開會討論抗日問題、兄弟提出十二條抗日方案、而他們對於我的提案、却完全不明瞭、我便很悲痛的回去痛哭流涙地寫了一篇文章（題爲救亡誓言）、在中報·時事新報·發表、這篇文章、</p>
<p>説的都是老實話、一句是調也没有、後來倒有很多報紙、很多地方、把我這篇文章轉載翻印、還　幾位朋友、説我這篇文章的價値、幾同德國Ｆichce的告國民書一樣、可見我的理論雖然不能取决一時、結果却終於不能永久埋没、所以從國難以來、我是立志唱「低調」的、到現在我還是唱低調、不管有没有人贊成我、我也不要借此爲我自已盜虚聲、找出路、謀地位、也並不是因爲人家唱高調、我特别要標新立異的唱低調、我覺得中國民族現在的衰落、現在如此嚴重的國難之由來、確非一朝一夕所致、我可以説、我們民族的衰落、當前的國難、是幾千年來民衆的社會的惰力」所造成、、我們民族被種根深蒂固的社會的惰力支配着、一切社會的活動、人民的力量、都無從發揚、因此無論國家那一方面的、</p>
<p>無論是文的、是武的、經濟的、政治的、社會的、</p>
<p>敎育的、各種各樣的事業、都没有長足的進步、</p>
<p>中國雖然是文化先進的國家、而中國的文化幾千年來受　種、大惰力」的壓制、没有能發揚、</p>
<p>因此、以一個最先進的文化國家、而現在竟成了最　落没有的國家、或者是文化進步最慢的國家、因爲這個原故、跟着文化所　、生的一切政洽、經濟、軍事、等各種「國力」、都無從發生、而成爲無「力量」的民族、民族旣没有「力量、」則在一優勝劣敗、天演的定律上、自然難免失敗、照社會學的原　説、本來人類發展的路向、是朝着阻力最小的方向進行的、日本、看我們中國無「力」</p>
<p>、他就從我們這條路向來發展它的軍國主義、發展它的帝國主義、發展它一切的侵略主義、所以　們展族衰落的原因、國難形成的原因、並不是從九一八才發生的、其禍根已老早埋伏着了、</p>
<p>我、今日如果要想救國、第一先要明白民族衰　的原因、研究如何充實國力的方法、並且還要脚踏實地、以身作則的做充實國力的凖備、我們現在旣已知道民族　落的原因、一方面、就要去消除阻碍民族發展的「惰力」、一方面、就要積極的作發展「國力」的凖備、有了健全的國力、自然會有抗日的力量、會有復興民族的力量、</p>

<p>停刊「讀書問答」啟事</p>
<p>時光過得　快，「讀書問答」與諸君見面已整整的九個月了。除開舊歷年關，和偶然因爲本報篇幅不够的關係停過不上十次的刊以外，</p>
<p>天天都有整萬讀者在閲讀它。我們非常的榮幸，我們在精神上獲得了如此多數的同情者，但在另一方面，我們不能不感覺慚愧了。</p>
<p>我們到底給了一些什麽與讀者了呢？在這停刊的前夜，我們確事的反省了一回。我們在此臨别之前，不能不有一番自白，我們不能不承認我們給與别人的東西，如果不是零，那也是太有限了。</p>
<p>這决不是謙虚的話。第一，因爲「讀書問答」本不過是本部工作的一部分，同時本部本身也不過是圖書館的一部門，我們没有更充足的時間來把「讀書問答」弄得更有聲色，更合實際。第二，因爲本報篇幅的關係，新聞稿件常常擁擠不堪，對於一篇貧弱的「讀書問答」，常常不得不截成幾段，使讀的人前後不相關聯，</p>
<p>讀了等於不讀。第三，因爲寫讀書問答的人，</p>
<p>在槪都是幾個書獃子，與店員學徒的實際生活，隔得太遠，所寫出的東西，不能不仍是帶着書生的氣氛，不能使眞正没有敎養的人去接近它。第四，我們也還受着許多方面善意的責難，嚴正的糾正，强勉盡棉力，想做到超然，實在心勞力拙，不能不負大家的期望。總之，反躬自問，除慚愧外，祇有自責。現在我們是不想再繼績做這種我們不能做的工作了。敬向關心我們的一切人士致謝並告罪。</p>
<p>今後呢？我們本是圖書館的工作者，對於館中的讀書指導的工作並不因此而終止，反之，我們更　集中精力在其他方面。同時還可附筆告慰讀者，讀書生活社不久將出版一種讀書雜誌名呌讀書生活半月刊，以後凡關於讀書的問題，或者該刊也要談到的，現在我們把這一報角暫時取銷，大致不會怎樣感覺寂寞罷丨</p>
<p>前後，我們萬分希望讀者隨時在生活中去攝取新的知識，今日的中國，定在一個非常豐富的時代中，祇要自已忠於生活，勤於攝取，</p>
<p>誠無往而不可獲得知識，我們勸諸君用心讀書，但同時不要太相信書，勸諸君有一分鐘時光就在大街閙市中去翻閲，不要回到明窗凈几的書　中地去。並祝大家珍重。</p>
<p>讀書指導部特另啟事··本部負責編輯的讀書問答雖宣告停刊，但我們並没有因上停止對本館或本報讀者讀書的指導，讀者諸君如有書本上的疑難，仍然可以盡量提出和我們討論，</p>
<p>在個别的覆信中我們當盡力代爲解答，以後讀者來信仍寄至上海南京路大陸商塲三樓申報流通圖書館讀書指導部收。</p>

<p>幼童文庫特刊</p>
<h3 id="c189">從教育的立場談談幼童文庫 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 董任坚</p>
<p>人，特别在幼童的時候，只要父母或社會有能力擔負没有不想給他受一種良好的敎育。</p>
<p>但是爲什麽要受敎育應該受什麽一種敎育有没有比較簡便的方法可以受到良好的敎育。</p>
<p>我們用不着談高深的學理，簡單地説，敎育無非是爲了做人就是要幼童認識人們的事事物物，了解人們的言語思想，覺察人們的喜怒哀樂要他可以和人們相處和人們合作然後他才可以加入了人們的社會，人們才不致擯棄他到社會之外換名話説：敎育的根本在使幼童「人化」</p>
<p>當然，幼童自出生，便沈溺在人們的經驗裏面：他見的無非是人們的事事物物他聽的無非是人們的言語思想，他感覺的無非是人們的喜怒哀樂然而他見的一時或許不很清楚，聽的一時或許不很明白，覺得的一時或許不很感動他常常看這樣看那樣又看别樣；問這個，問那個，又問别個：這是什麽？這做什麽用的這是從什麽地方來的這常常是這樣的嗎？怎樣做的？是誰做的？我能做嗎···敎育者就應該回答他這些問題而教育，就是在這些問答裏面！我們能够回答他，能够充分地回答他有趣地回答他他便會再看，再問，再去感覺體察，從一點到别點，從一步再進一步直到他能够自已解答自已進步爲止。</p>
<p>我們曉得當代的社會已經不似從前的一樣簡單一樣容易看到聽到感到就是一般的成人那裏都能够認識覺察社會的事事物物就是認識了覺察了他們那裏都能够曉行怎樣表示給幼童看出，解釋給幼童聽懂刺激給幼童覺得就是和幼童很接近的父母，就是有了敎學經驗的幼稚園和小學低年級敎師也似乎很難保證他們定有成效。所以無論在家庭，在學校，無論是父母，是敎師是幼童自已都需要有一種優良的指導，學習的工具，和人化的媒介。這點，從敎育的立場看來記者以爲是商務印書館所發行「幼童文庫」的眞實貢獻我們特地製了下列「兒童的發達和幼童文庫圖」表示這個意思并祝這「幼童文庫」的成功和編輯發行這新文庫者的繼續努力</p>
<h3 id="c190">幼童文庫的解剖 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 徐應昶</p>
<p>我記得在今年兒童節的時候，曾經寫了「從兒童節説到商務印書館的兒童用書」一文，内容大槪是説在兒童節應該把良好的兒童讀物贈給兒童並且把小學生文庫所含各類的書，作一簡括的介紹；最後又説到小學生文庫的書是屬於小學中高年級的，希望本館在不久的將來，對於小學低年級方面也有整套的讀物出版。</p>
<p>的確，小學低年級生也要欣賞有趣的讀物，也有求知的慾望如果對小學低年級生稍存岐視，不把相當程度的圖書供給他們那就非但對不起一般小學低年級生，並且有背敎育的原則，這件事似乎不容忽視。並且敎育部所訂小學國語課程敎學要點中也曾説起：「每週除精讀外，應有定時指導略讀」又説「···除課内指導外應督促兒童課外痥讀···」本館爲了完成供給小學低年級生課外讀物的使命於小學生文庫編輯完成之後卽積極進行編印這部幼童文庫以適應小學低年級生的需要。</p>
<p>幼童文庫經過嚴密的計劃，並承三十多位富有敎學及編撰經驗的同志合作，幸告成功，不久就可以和全國小朋友見面了爲了要使得全國人士明瞭幼童文庫的内容起見我們特地把牠的内容加以解剖希望國内兒童敎育專家小學敎師及家長們指正。</p>
<p>（一）本文庫的取材</p>
<p>無論編印一本或一部的兒童用書，取材方面如果單以迎合兒童的低級興趣爲目的這種書不但於兒童無益並且有害兒童本文庫取材方面曾經再三斟酌，詳訂編輯條例各書内容完全以復興民族爲中心如提倡勞動生産，指示禦侮救國，培養公民道德，啓發科學知識等無不兼籌並顧凡含有自私自利攘奪，關爭，消極，畏縮，悲觀，束縛及封建思想等等材料一律避免此外又注重兒童活動的材料；有可以唱的，有可以玩的，有可以做的，凡兒童愛好的活動都盡量搜集在内。全書材料創作特多。</p>
<p>（二）本文庫的程度</p>
<p>本文庫是按照小學低年級生的程度而編輯的全部以圖書爲主。輔以簡短文字的説明；凡讀過半册或一册國語敎科書的小學生祇須敎師或家長略加指導，便能够自已閲讀。</p>
<p>（三）本文庫的門類</p>
<p>本文庫參照小學低年級課程標準的科目，把内容分爲：社會、公民、自然、算術、衞生體育勞作美術詩歌語文謎語故事等十二類，凡小學低年級生所應有的如能，無不具備現在，我們把本文庫第一集二百册各類材料的比例分析如下：</p>
<p>門類册數％比門類册數％比</p>
<p>社會二九１４·５公民六８·０</p>
<p>自然四一２０．５算術四２．０</p>
<p>衛生一一５．５體靑三１．５</p>
<p>勞作八４．０　術五２．５</p>
<p>詩歌七３．５語文四２．０</p>
<p>謎語四２．０故事七八３９．０</p>
<p>統計二○○１００．０</p>
<p>把十二類材料歸納起來，在致可分爲兩大項：（甲）屬於知能的，如社會、公民、自然、算術、衛生、體育、勞作、語文、謎語等：（乙）屬於欣賞的，如算術、詩歌、故事等。</p>
<p>試把這兩大項材料統計一下屬於知能的合計一百十册，屬於欣賞的，合計九十册，兩相比較，所差無幾。根據這一個比例，可以知道本文庫的内容，無論質和　兩方面都委均衡還没有偏重任何一種材料的弊病。</p>
<p>（四）本文庫的支配</p>
<p>本文庫第一集因限於册數（二百册，）每一門類當然不能把應有的材料，完全包括在内，但是我們經過詳細的計劃，已將每一門類中最重要的材料盡量容納了現在我們且把本文庫社會類所包含的書作爲一個例子，略示我們對於支配每一門類的計劃。</p>
<p>本文庫社會類的書計二十九册，書名如下：</p>
<p>一、可愛的中國二、各書地圖的形狀</p>
<p>三、我的家四、我的鄉</p>
<p>五、我們的學校六、我們的圖書</p>
<p>七、太古人的生活八、樹居人</p>
<p>九、穴居人一○、衣</p>
<p>一一、食一二、住</p>
<p>一三、行一四、掃街</p>
<p>一五、救火一六、國貨展覽會</p>
<p>一七、熱的地方一八、冷的地方</p>
<p>一九、各國的國　二○、各國的小朋友</p>
<p>二一、孫中山二二、　花</p>
<p>二三、雙十節二四、兒童節</p>
<p>二五、幾個偉人（上）二六、幾個偉人（下）</p>
<p>二七、我們的海軍二人、我們的　軍</p>
<p>二九、我們的空軍</p>
<p>上列各書如可愛的中國各省地圖的形狀目的在引起兒　的國家觀念；我的家，我的鄉可以使兒　認識自已的家鄉；我們的學校，我們的圖書室，可以使兒童明瞭學校的組織及其環境太古人的生活，樹居人，衣，食，往，行，可以使兒童明白人類生活的進化概况摕街救火屬是於社會事業的材料國貨展覽會目的在養成兒童愛用國貨的習慣熱的地方，冷的地方，是屬於地理的知識：各國的國旗，各國的小朋友，是屬於國際的材料孫中山，黄花岡雙十節目的在使兒童明瞭、總理及其他先烈締造民國的功動，並知道國慶日的可愛兒童節和兒童有密切的關係，可以使兒童知道尊重自已的地位；幾個偉人裏的代表人物，有的和文化有關係，有的是愛國志士，有的是料學家，有的是探險家，都可以給兒童做模範的；我們的海軍，我們的陸軍，我們的空軍，可以使兒童對於國防的設備有所認識。</p>
<p>綜看上述各書的内容可以略見本文庫材料支配的適當和聯絡的密切了他如公民，自然，算術等類材料的支配，都各有特色，因限於篇幅，不能一一列舉舉。</p>
<p>（五）本文庫的體例</p>
<p>本文庫中除勞作美術詩歌謎語等因性質特殊外，其他各類的書，每册都自成一個單元各書的體裁，依材料的性質而不同有韻文有散文韻文不僅限於詩歌一類，卽社會，公民，自然，衞生，體育，謎語等，也有用韻文寫成的，因爲韻文有音節，可吟誦易於上口，便於記憶，閲讀興趣，也比較的濃厚，所以本文庫的材料凡，可以用韻文編撰的便用韻文編撰以增進兒童閲讀的效率。</p>
<p>（六）本文庫的字句</p>
<p>本文庫各書用字，異常審愼；先依據各專家研究結果，作爲藍本用字，並參酌現行各科低年級用書擬定一種常用字彚然後依據字彚決定本文庫各書的用字。關於語句的組織，竭力注意簡短；每面最多不過八句，每句至多不過九字（間有若干册書如我的玩具，動物園等，因説明須詳盡語句不得不較原來標準稍多，但此種盡數，不超過百分之七。）名法完全適合兒童口吻，務使幼童閲讀便利，效率因此而增高。</p>
<p>本文庫因爲要符合課程標準，自初小三年級起，有「國音注音符號的熟習」的規定起見，所以本文庫各書一律不加注音符號，以便專供低年級生用。</p>
<p>幼童讀物的字體要大，在閲讀時　能够一目了然，且不致傷害目力本文庫的字體，全是楷書體最大的等於普通頭號鉛字其次也相當於普二號鉛字。字體挺秀，筆　清楚，可作兒童書寫的模範。</p>
<p>（七）本文庫的圖書</p>
<p>兒音歡喜欣賞圖書，比較欣賞文字更加熱烈，本文庫每一册書都有優美活潑的圖書，一方面能使兒童對於書的内容發生深刻的印象，一方面又能引起兒童愛美的興趣，在圖書上也收到相當的教育效能。</p>
<p>本文庫第一集二百册内有五十册用五彩精印，五十册用兩色套印，一百册用單色彩墨印刷。凡事物須表現其眞實性的，都用五彩精印，使兒童對於某種事物有正確的認識。例如動物園，鳥，蝶和蛾，我們的果子各書，就是全書用彩色印成的幾個例子。</p>
<p>（八）本文庫的紙張</p>
<p>兒童讀物的紙張，須比普通的堅厚，纔不容易破壞本文庫所用的紙張是一百四十磅的厚瑞士紙，質地堅　，各書可以長久保存。紙張不但潔白，並且没有反光，不傷目力，這也是本文庫的一種特色。</p>
<p>（九）本文庫的書式</p>
<p>兒童讀物的版式，過大或過小，都不適宜；版式過大，不但庋藏時要佔據很大的地位，卽在　帶時也不方，便；如果版式太小，就不能不把字體和圖書縮小，這樣又要妨礙了兒童學習的心理。本文庫的版式高市尺七寸五分，寛四寸，與本館出版的敎科書及兒童書報同樣大小，無論庋藏帶，都很便利。</p>
<p>（十）本文庫的應用</p>
<p>本文庫因爲内容豐富，編制完善，圖書多，文字淺所以牠的應用範圍也比較的廣。除專供家庭組織圖書館，備兒童在家閲讀，及學校圖書館另　低年級圖書室備低年級生在校閲讀外，又可供成人圖書館另　兒童閲書部，備附近兒童到館閲讀；更可作爲各地民衆敎育館，農民敎育館及公共閲書報處備年長失學者作爲補習書用。</p>
<p>關於本文庫的内容和形式方面已略加解剖如上；至於本文庫出版後各方面應用的效果，容有機會，再行報告。</p>

<p>— 藩之展</p>
<p>記得在去年的國慶日，我曾發表一篇介紹小學生文庫的文字到現在恰是一整年。在過去的一年裏，全國訂購小學生文庫的據説已超過一萬閲讀的小學生，照約略的估計，當在百萬左右：小學生閲讀了所得的益處必然很大。</p>
<p>小學生文庫的内容，適合小學中高年級生。如果要供給小學低年級生閲讀還須另行編撰一部較爲淺顯的文庫。商務印書館爲適應這個需要在小學生文庫編輯完成後，便從事幼童文庫的編輯；現在已集稿付印定期出版了這件工作我覺得很有價値他的價値可説和小學生文庫的一樣。</p>
<p>編印一部眞能適合幼童閲讀的文庫，的確是一件不很容易的事我以爲編印這種文庫，至少要顧到下列這幾點。</p>
<p>第一，整部的文庫，必須有整個的計劃和組織在可能範圍内各册更須成爲整個的單元。</p>
<p>第二，所有材料要適合幼童生活，幼童閲讀了經驗可以逐漸發展。</p>
<p>第三，各册所用的字彚，要使幼童容易認識並了解句法也須適合幼童的口吻。</p>
<p>第四，幼童極喜歡欣賞圖書，所有揷圖，必須生動活潑富於興趣。</p>
<p>第五，印刷裝釘，不但要美觀，而且要堅牢；因爲美觀　容易引起幼童閲讀的興趣；裝釘堅牢，　可保存長久。</p>
<p>我們要介紹幼童文庫。當然不能忽略上列五點。</p>
<p>幼童文庫第一集共二百册，分爲社會，公民、自然算術衛生體育勞作美術詩歌、語文、謎語、故事等十二類，已把幼童應有的知識技能和各種活動包括在内據編輯人稱，各類的材料各有相當的聯絡，各册也儘可能的自成單元幼童閲讀了不但能生活充實而。且能養成應付現社會的能力全文庫所用字彚都有根據句法也儘量顧到幼童的口吻。所有揷圖，線條很是活潑彩色更是美麗所用紙張質料堅厚，而没有反光，幼童閲讀，可不傷目力。</p>
<p>所以，就事實來説，幼童文庫對於上述五點，都能顧到在幼童讀物貧乏的我國，有了這部幼童文庫供給全國幼童閲讀收效之大當不難想像。</p>
<p>全國小學校如果缺少低年級補充讀物各家庭如果願爲孩子謀敎育方面的幸福，各圖書館如果要創辦幼童部，我想，這部幼童文庫定能予以很大的幫助。</p>

<p>但中途形勢　堅後疲、一天市况頗形恍惚、十一月期仍隨舊標凖爲轉移、但因多頭有敲大掉期之謠、兩日間差度升至二元關、前途預測、如照大條而言、則十一月份之多頭、似較十二月爲不穏、設按結價而言、則以二元之差度、買方似乎吃虧也、十一月份籌碼已减少至二萬三千一百條、今將一天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開爲九一九元六角、較前收下跌四元六角、匯市晨開近期曾價英匯一先令五便士七五、美匯卅六元三一二五、元茂永恒餘正昌賣出、華比出來正月份差金八七五、而自二○元一角退至八元一角、大德成福興永元茂永大發永大連帮餘慶水等進條、而升至九元四角、福昌又賣到八元二角、預悉匯　掛牌英美各升一二五未能滿意、大發永福興永兆豐昌元亭慶餘恒餘等奪購下、而漲到廿二元二角、元茂永恒餘永利售條、退至零五角、大德成恒餘大發永雖有買胃、永利元昌永永豐元豐永福餘尙賣、復由二元退至零三角、恒餘大德成大發永福興永同福宏利春源永等仍進正月份美金五六二五、已告難結、而升至二元、順茂元豐永益成雖賣至一元一角、人心尙好、生大元茂永餘慶永福餘永利恒餘連續購買、乃漲到三元半、銀行對做正月份美金已四三七五、鴻興福興永福安餘慶永義豐永趁高脱乎、華比塞十一月份美金三一二五、十二月份三七五、而降爲零七角、恒興源大德成來進拉上一元、但因散户力撳而仍挫、迨夫元一上塲猛售、立破二十元關、退至十八元七角、大德成恒餘雖進至九元關、内盤已硬、　氣殊濃、大連帮兆豐昌春源永等脱乎、下降爲七元、天豐永福餘大德成進條拉上一元、午收仍爲九一七元六角、</p>
<p>後市開盤九一七元八角、塲外曾退至七元二、人心尙好、良以中央續有開現之聲、</p>
<p>華比吃十二月份美金五六二五、大連帮及乾昌祥雖售、益成大德成則進、逐漸拉上、入後大德成一再進條、而漲到二十元外、銀行出來十一月份美金五六二五、慶餘餘慶永賣出、降爲十八元三角、匯豐麥加利力扒英金、塲内頗多求方、恒餘元茂永鼎泰納條、而升至二十元外、大發永春源永乾昌祥大德成更進、孟買電告微跌、而漲到二十一元半、麥加利塞十一月份美金四三七五、</p>

<p>結價因匯豐銀行美匯掛牌升一二五爲三十五元八一二五、合標金價九六六元、照收盤價言約撳四十六元弱、較前收略有多撳、十二月份新標凖結價、因中央銀行標金標凖價計九五六元有零、照收盤價言約撳四十六元餘、較前收多撳五元、本月份登賬價九一八元、十一月份同、十二月份同、上午補水九一八元、下午補水九二○元、赤金仍照加十元光景、掛牌九二九元六角、塲内毫無動靜、津貨買價照加十一元半、</p>

<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>記得美國詩人惠鐵門（Ｗhitman）在他的一篇論文Ｄemoceratic中，講起美國已是民主政體的政府，而亞洲各國如中國土耳其等，還是極端專制政體，他頗深以爲這是美國可驕傲的地方。誰知過丁幾十年，在東亞方面，也起了革命的浪潮，竟將數千年來的專制政體推翻。所以，辛亥革命，就其本身講，是有特殊意義的，換名話説，辛亥革命，雖不能如法國革命對全世界有所貢獻，但亞洲濃厚專制空氣中，突然有此霹　一聲，自然，使亞洲各民族也起了不少的波動，這是我們可以講的。</p>
<p>不過，有人也許要講美國革命後，卽走上憲政軌道，而中國自革命後，混亂的局面，延長了二十多年之久，對國事前途發生感慨。其實，這不足怪的，我們要知道，美國的上憲政軌道，也不是一蹴而幾的，開國之始，也有黨爭，及後經過一次内戰，政治才安定。並非美國人是安格羅撒克遜的子孫，安格羅撒克遜的特質，正如英國政論波克（Ｒurke所説，是一向有愛好自由的精神的，他們秉其過去的傳統，民主政體的成功，自然容易。中國歷史遺留下來的，恰巧相反，在這樣情形之下，自然易爲政客軍閥所利用了。</p>
<p>今年已辛亥革命二十三年了，「大亂之後，必有大洽」，倘使以往多年的混亂，已大得够了，則來日希望，正未爲遠，今年的雙十節，更値得特别紀念了。</p>

<p>三個靑年，全穿西裝，兩個戴鴨舌子便帽，另一個高個兒的歪頂首一個呢帽。</p>
<p>紅着眼珠子·幾條腿在盡着圏，咕噥着，從一家酒館門口拐了出來。</p>
<p>雙十節，黄昏的衛，店舖前掛滿了黨旗國旗，「雙十節大　價」的廣告幟，各舖子樓窗上的喇叭大鼓搥得有勁兒地，街，比平日熱閙多了。</p>

<h3 id="c239">我所見的龍眠鄕村學校 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 天聾</p>
<p>在未談本題之前，作者先要略説桐城的文化和敎育；桐城的文化，往日確有幾位老師宿儒，苦撑持着幾百年，在海内也還　薄享點倖名，而今是式微極了！</p>
<p>敎育是與文有聯銷的關係，文化旣然式微，敎育也跟着落後了，但是，桐城的學堂，開辦得最早，在甲午以後，舉國昌言維新，吳摯甫先生自日本考察敎育回來，首先就在家鄕開辦學堂，依年齒序，差不多和「北京大學」是連胎的弟兄哩，到今日，吳先生所手創的學堂，名義上還存在、骨子裏，也就今我們不好措詞了！</p>
<p>桐城北，緊傍着「龍眠山」，上接天柱，潛獄，諸峯，綿延千百里靑葱不斷的山脈，山中千萬户人民，都靠着挑柴，賣炭、來撑持龍眠山的塲面，這些苦朋友和他們的子弟，「字」是無緣認識，「敎育」更是與他們無分。</p>
<p>民國二十年多。桐城有一個學初等敎育的，姓王，號華英，他想獨力在這個山中，辦一個「龍眠鄕村學校」，首先來和我商量，我固極端的贊成。但我自嫌生命太若，要終年的東奔西騁的去找飯吃。要是辦這樣的敎育，來救濟失學的人，慚愧！我是個泥菩薩，雖然濟世有心，若要從水救人，却恐自身莫保，我看他有　　偉大的動機，也就本着我的熱腸，替他計劃着：怎樣入手，怎樣布置、怎樣施敎，末了，我還鼓勵他幾句道：「山東武訓，是一個乞丐，他到能一手創辦堂邑，臨清，館陶二縣的學校，梁任公爲之立傳，敎育部替他褒揚，喧騰中外，何况你還是個學敎育的？」</p>
<p>他的信念，從此更堅决，摒　一切職務，專心在這個「龍眠鄕村學校」上科求，（皖滬各報，均有紀載其事　）現在居然早已開學了。</p>
<p>這裏我再夾雜着叙述他辦這個學校的宗旨，是採取建敎合一爲原則的，課室雖然有固定的房　，但是流動敎室，是採用露天演講式的，課本就取諸大自然的實物（農業，如森林果實，五毅，菜蔬等類。工業，如木，鐵，銅，錫等類）。學生全招收農工及農工的子弟，不分年齡與等級，可是敎授須分門類，每一門功課授完了，就呌「畢課」，不呌「畢業」。大槪在這個學校裏讀書的、是個個能生産的，一面生産，一面受敎，到很合乎「生産敎育化」與「敎育生産化」的條件。</p>
<p>最後，我再略述這地方的山水，從前戴南山先生、曾用「秀絕人　」四個字來揄揚過的，可惜山水雖秀麗，敎育和文化，不能相稱！就彷彿掀唇豁齒的醜婦人，穿着一件極華麗的鮮艶衣服，路人望見，不免要搖頭，説一聲「作賤綾羅」！名山勝水，是與人文，互相媲美的，桐城旣有「秀絕人衰」的大自然風景，敎育和文化這樣的落伍，可不是也令山靈减色嗎？於今突然有了這個嶄新的學校，這不單是地方之幸、並且也替山靈增色不少呀！</p>
<h3 id="c240">雙十回憶 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>清代的末年，我還很小，因此對於那時的雙十革命，情形一點也不清楚，但在家裏激起的小小變動，却到如今，仍舊依稀記得。</p>
<p>那是一個深秋的早上，霜雖還没有在田野間出現，但穿着的夾衣，却已經不够使人暖和了。閒着的么叔，便拉着我在門外的土牆邊，靠着葉子半黄的桑樹，坐在石滚（農家壓平土塊用的）上，晒着温熱的朝陽。</p>
<p>陽光煦育着的田野中，胡豆剛從潤𣺝的黑土裏、冒出一兩分長的嫩苗，龍鬚菜却已是碧油油的生長着，密密地舖在田裏了。預備種麥的地，亦已　了出來，正對着晴郎的秋空，吐散着新鮮的泥味。丨丨這正是成都原野裏很好的深秋時節。</p>
<p>「呵」！</p>
<p>么叔忽然氣促地驚呌了一聲，我立即隨着他的眼睛望去，原來是長着龍鬚菜的田邊，開有粉白野菊花的小路上，正對我們走來六七個着短衣　黑布套頭的精壯漢子，腰上都掛有生黄牛皮做鞘的短刀。至於有没有槍，却是記不起了。</p>
<p>「呵，珍珍娃兒！」（娃兒二字須拚成一個音讀）</p>
<p>么叔認出一個熟人來了，驀地這樣自言自語地小聲説着，却没有喊出來。但爲首一個螃蟹臉的，老遠便反遲着刀把子的手一揚，向着么叔做聲做氣地呌道：</p>
<p>「老么！你認得我嗎？去告訴你的伯伯，説是陳大爺來了！」</p>
<p>他知道我的父親和么叔他們，都把祖父喊做伯伯的。么叔嚇得紅漲着臉，一時回答不出話來。</p>
<p>這時祖父不知得了誰的通知，已把家裏一匹車水灌田用的褐色大騾子，牽出門來了，現着驚惶的臉色，嘴唇抖抖地説道：</p>
<p>「老丨」剛吐出這麽一個字，便忙又改口了，「陳大哥，諾（騾）子，你，你牽去好了。」</p>
<p>那個螃蟹臉的，從祖父手裏接過騾子的韁繩，同時睜大眼睛，將下巴尖往左一擺。</p>
<p>「你曉得嗎？老傢伙！官兵快要打來了。那時候，一刀一個，一刀一個，大的小的，都不留！」</p>
<p>説到這裏他把凶厲的眼鋒，向我横掃了一下。往後，我在夜裏做夢，倘若是遇着了嚇人的强盜，那就多半是有着一個螃蟹的臉和這麽一對可怕的眼睛的。</p>
<p>他一面爬上了大騾子的背，一面快活地説道：</p>
<p>「不要怕！不要怕！他娘的官兵！」</p>
<p>臨走時，他又回頭向祖父粗聲地喝道：</p>
<p>「放心些！老傢伙，打退了官兵就還你！」</p>
<p>他們走了之後，祖父就呌我們進去，趕快把大門緊緊關着。</p>
<p>這時候，祖母從屋裏拐着小足怱怱地跑了出來，一面把水緄的手，朝藍布的圍裙上，不住地揩着，兜頭對祖父顫聲地駡道：</p>
<p>「下年灌田怎麽辦呀！你，你，昨晚還在賭咒：那個牽你的騾子，要拚命····你今天····就是你自家呵····」</p>
<p>祖父到這時好像要把剛才的氣，完全爆發出來似的，沙啞着喉嚨，厲聲地回駡：</p>
<p>「現在大家都造反了，不牽他，他會進來搶光你的，····連你的衣服，連你的褲子！」</p>
<p>········</p>
<p>第二天下午，么叔揹着我，和提　包袱的祖父祖母母親他們，一塊兒離開了家，父親和另一些人却留着。</p>
<p>當父親送了我們一會之後，轉去時，吩咐大家説：</p>
<p>「晚上要挨着土墻睡呀！子彈會穿通木板的。」</p>
<p>因爲父親進過學校，並且最近到塲上匏哥大爺那裏拜過把，加入了反清的同洽會的，所以曉得官兵已在用着洋槍了。</p>
<p>「曉得呀！」</p>
<p>母親似乎在含着眼涙回答。</p>
<p>現在想起，這便算是有生以來，開始逃難的一次了。但逃得並不遠，只逃在兩三里路　的族人家裏住着而已。</p>
<p>不幾天，父親來接我們，説是革命已經成功不再打仗，可以安安穩穩地回家了。但回家時，祖父發現留在家裏的人，已經全把鷄鴨殺來吃，並且又打失　騾子，便氣憤憤地駡了一陣，從上變成不平家了。每年一到雙十節前後，家人若談到這次逃難的事情，祖父便會特别黑起臉無故駡人的。</p>
<p>如今别了九年的故鄉，不知遭了幾多次的戰爭，想來飽嘗逃難之苦的祖父，到今年的雙十節，該已對於往事心平氣和了吧。</p>

<p>坐在下手位的開暘麻，皮因爲是主人，覺得有勸解勸解這一次爭論的必要了。拿起酒壼向大生先生酒杯裏灌了一滿杯，接着又向馮文先生木仁老····依次瀉去。</p>

<p>這一席話給坐在一旁的人説的發聲呌好了。坐在床沿上底阿賢，坐在小竹椅上的阿得火眼，都點起頭來。</p>
<p>「是呀！大生叔當然也是一時之見，推做不管丨丨不過，我想，第二次抽不抽還説不定，現在可不必講遭事了一。阿賢參加着説。阿賢是住在開暘麻家隔壁。此刻却不是來吃忌飯的。他是打着空來聽新聞。</p>

<p>Legislative Yuan Passes Draft Constitution</p>
<h3 id="e6">Examining Clauses Regarding the Examination Yuan and Control Yuan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>No Examination Committee to be Established in the Examination Yuan</p>
<p>Control Yuan May Question Various Yuan</p>
<p>Impeachment Case Referred for Review Again</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued to discuss the draft constitution at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Chairman Sun Ke declared the meeting open and deliberated on Article 86 of Section 5 of Chapter 4 of the Examination Yuan: "The Examination Yuan is the highest organ of the Central Government exercising the power of examination and assessment." Huang Youchang proposed deleting the words "and assessment" and adding "in charge of examinations." There were no objections and it was passed. The third amendment to Article 87 of the draft constitution is: "The Examination Yuan shall have one president, with a term of four years, appointed by the President with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The President of the Examination Yuan shall be responsible to the National Assembly." Zhong Tianxin said that in order to eliminate the malpractices of manipulating examinations, the term should be extended to eight or ten years. Liu Guanting said that whether the term is extended or not is irrelevant to the independence of the examination power. Lü Zhiyi said that according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, examination matters should be presided over by the Examination Committee. In the past, the goodness of examinations was that the examiners were temporarily designated, and the candidates could not cheat. As a result, the third amendment was passed. Article 88: "The Examination Yuan shall establish a Ministry of Personnel and an Examination Committee when conducting examinations." Jiao Yitang advocated retaining the Examination Committee to handle examination affairs. Luo Ding agreed. Zhang Zhihan, Lü Zhiyi, and others opposed it. Lü said that there is no need to establish an Examination Committee. The President should be responsible for examination affairs. If there are many examination affairs, more administrative officials can be appointed, so as to avoid duplication and lack of concentrated responsibility. The Chairman stood up and said that this issue is very simple and does not need much discussion. Examination matters can be stipulated in the organizational law of the Examination Yuan, and he also does not advocate establishing an Examination Committee. It was then put to a vote and passed, maintaining the original proposal. Article 89: "The Minister of Personnel shall be nominated by the President of the Examination Yuan according to law and appointed and dismissed by the President. The Chairman and members of the Examination Committee shall be nominated by the President of the Examination Yuan according to law and appointed by the President." There were no objections to this article and it was passed as originally proposed. Article 90: "The following qualifications shall be determined by the Examination Yuan through examination: (1) Qualifications for appointment of civil servants; (2) Qualifications of candidates for public office; (3) Qualifications for practicing specialized professions or technical personnel." Luo Yunyan questioned whether the qualifications of candidates for public office referred to in the second item include representatives of the National Assembly. Huang Youchang said that the examination and determination of qualifications are of great importance and should be stipulated in the constitution, and requested that the words "according to law" be added under the words "Examination Yuan." Hu Xuanming proposed changing "or" in the third item to "and." Wei Tingsheng proposed that it is difficult to examine representatives of the National Assembly because of their varying levels of education. Jiao Yitang and Lü Zhiyi opposed it. Then the Chairman, based on the opinions of the committee members, revised and passed the second reading, as follows: "The following qualifications shall be determined by the Examination Yuan according to law: (1) Qualifications for appointment of civil servants; (2) Qualifications of candidates for public office; (3) Qualifications for practicing specialized professions and technical personnel." Article 91: "The organization of the Examination Yuan shall be determined by law." There were no objections and it was passed as originally proposed. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. The deliberation continued in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan deliberated on the articles of the Examination Yuan of the draft constitution on the morning of the 9th. After the discussion, the discussion continued on Article 92 of Section 6 of the Control Yuan: "The Control Yuan is the highest organ of the Central Government exercising the power of supervision, in charge of impeachment and auditing, and responsible to the National Assembly." Article 93: "The Control Yuan shall have one president, with a term of four years, and may be re-elected." There were no objections to the above two articles and they were passed as originally proposed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan met on the morning of the 9th and passed the following articles, starting from Article 94: "During the adjournment of the National Assembly, when the President of the Control Yuan leaves office due to any reason, the members of the Control Yuan shall elect an acting President." There were no objections and it was passed as originally proposed. Article 95: "The members of the Control Yuan shall be elected by the National Assembly. Each province shall elect three representatives, and the National Assembly representatives elected by Mongolia, Tibet, and overseas Chinese shall each elect two representatives. The candidates are not limited to the National Assembly representatives." This article was changed to "The members of the Control Yuan shall be pre-elected by the National Assembly representatives elected by each province, Mongolia, Tibet, and overseas Chinese, with each electing two representatives, and submitted to the National Assembly for election. The candidates are not limited to the National Assembly representatives," according to the proposal of Zhong Tianxin and others. The second reading was amended and passed. Article 96: "The term of office of the members of the Control Yuan shall be four years and they may be re-elected." Passed as originally proposed. Liang Hancao proposed adding an article within the powers of the Control Yuan: "Regarding supervisory matters, the Control Yuan may submit inquiries to various yuan, ministries, and commissions." Liu Guanting and Jiao Yitang both expressed their support. Chen Changheng strongly opposed it, saying that if the Control Yuan can submit inquiries to various yuan, it will interfere with the policies of the Executive Yuan. Moreover, if the Executive Yuan is questioned and the reply is not satisfactory, disputes will inevitably arise, which is inappropriate. The President announced the vote and the amendment was passed. The original text is: "In order to exercise its supervisory powers, the Control Yuan may, according to law, submit inquiries to various yuan, ministries, and commissions." (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued to deliberate on "Article 98" at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. "When central and local civil servants violate the law or neglect their duties, the members of the Control Yuan shall file an impeachment according to the following provisions: 1. For impeachment cases against the President and Vice President, the proposal must be made by more than ten members of the Control Yuan and co-signed by more than one-half of all the members of the Control Yuan. 2. For impeachment cases against the Presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan, the proposal must be made by more than five members of the Control Yuan and co-signed by more than one-third of all the members of the Control Yuan. 3. For impeachment cases against the members of the Executive Council, the ministers of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan, the chairmen of the various committees, the members of the Legislative Yuan, and the members of the Control Yuan, the proposal must be made by more than two members of the Control Yuan and co-signed by more than five members. 4. For impeachment cases against other civil servants, the proposal must be made by more than one member of the Control Yuan and co-signed by more than three members." The committee members had divergent opinions on this article. Zhang Weihan believed that it would be difficult for the Control Yuan members to impeach the President and members of the Control Yuan because of personal relationships, and such a thing would never happen. Cheng Zhonghang proposed that the impeachment of the President of the Control Yuan should be listed in a separate clause in the second item, and the impeachment of the members of the Control Yuan should be listed in a separate clause in the third item. The number of reviewers and co-signers should be reduced compared to the impeachment of other Presidents, members, and ministers, so that the impeachment case can be easily established. Di Ying, Shi Weihuan, and Gu Zhenggang agreed. Fu Bingchang reported the opinions of the review committee on this article, saying that the members of the Control Yuan are different from the censors of the past. If the censors of the past impeached falsely, they would be punished by the imperial family, but the members of the Control Yuan would not. Therefore, the number of proposals and co-signers for impeachment cases should be increased. The proposal for an impeachment case must first go through the review and decision procedures before it can be co-signed, so as to avoid the malpractice of indiscriminate impeachment. Luo Ding said that the amendments of the review committee are too strict on the impeachment procedures, which may hinder the exercise of the power of supervision. Deng Gongxuan and Feng Zhaoyi believed that the first and second items can be stipulated in the constitution, and the third and fourth items should be deleted. Hu Xuanming, Wang Yuxiang, and Chen Ruxuan advocated maintaining the original proposal. Liu Guanting advocated fundamentally reforming this article and proposing another amendment. Liang Hancao added to Liu's proposal. Liu and Liang jointly proposed an amended article: "When the Central Yuan finds that a central or local public official has violated the law or been derelict in their duties, an impeachment case may be filed upon the proposal of one or more members of the Central Yuan and the review of five or more members. However, for the impeachment of the President, Vice President, and the Presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan, the proposal must be made by ten or more members of the Control Yuan, and the review must be decided by more than one-half of all the members of the Control Yuan before it can be filed." Huang Youchang and others seconded the proposal and requested that it be put to a vote. As a result, the amended article was passed in the second reading. Article 99: "Impeachment cases shall be submitted to the Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries, unless otherwise provided by the Constitution." Lin Bin and others proposed an amendment to this article, which reads: "Impeachment cases shall be submitted to the Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries. During the adjournment of the National Assembly, impeachment cases against the President, Vice President, and the Presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan shall be jointly reviewed by five members of the Legislative Yuan and judges of the Judicial Yuan elected by each other, with the President of the Legislative Yuan presiding. However, when the President of the Legislative Yuan is impeached, the President of the Judicial Yuan shall preside. When the impeachment case is deemed reasonable after review in accordance with the preceding paragraph, a provisional National Assembly shall be convened to resolve whether or not to remove the impeached official. When the impeachment case in the second paragraph is deemed reasonable after review, the impeached person shall immediately recuse themselves, and the agency of their functions shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution." Lin Bin explained the reasons for the amendment. Shi Shangkuan and Luo Ding opposed, saying that the impeachment case of the President by the Control Yuan can be directly submitted to the National Assembly without going through this review body. Wu Shangying advocated that the impeachment case of the President should be reviewed entirely by the Legislative Yuan. Tao Lüqian and Chen Changheng seconded the proposal. Shi Weihuan advocated that one person should be selected by the National Assembly representatives of each province to be specifically responsible for reviewing impeachment cases of the President. This representative shall be convened only when there is an impeachment case of the President and shall not exercise any other powers at other times. At this point in the discussion, the Chairman, considering the great importance of this article, designated Tao Lüqian, Wu Shangying, Chen Ruxuan, Lin Bin, and Chuan Bingchang to review it again and submit it to the next general meeting for discussion. The meeting was then adjourned at 5:30 PM, and it was decided to continue the general meeting at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 11th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the establishment of the War Zone Reorganization Committee, all outstanding issues in the war zone will be handled by the committee. The committee will be divided into four sections: security, transportation, military affairs, and foreign affairs, for separate reorganization. Security will be reorganized by Li Zeyi, transportation by Yin Tong, military affairs by Zhu Shiqin, and foreign affairs by Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others, so that all issues in the war zone can be gradually resolved. (9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming called on Huang this morning at 8:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, Li Zeyi, Yin Tong, Tao Shangming, and others jointly discussed the war zone issues and the steps for reorganization at the Political Reorganization Council. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The branch cards at the five passes of the Great Wall in the Tianjin Customs District were established one after another last month. Due to heavy rains in Hebei and Rehe, the roads were destroyed, transportation was inconvenient, and tax revenue was low. Cattle and sheep produced in western Rehe and Mongolia are transported in large numbers through Gubeikou to the south every day. The revenue of the Gubeikou branch card is better. The five passes collect a total of about 50,000 yuan per month. Due to the length of the Great Wall branch card line, which reaches thousands of miles, it is not easy to implement anti-smuggling measures for the time being. Zhang Yongnian, the tax director of the Tianjin Customs District's Great Wall Pass Branch Card Office, is preparing to inspect various branch pass cards and then plan anti-smuggling measures for the entire line.

<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<h3 id="e9">Decides on Policy Towards the United States <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Seeking American Understanding on Disarmament Proposal</p>
<p>Maintaining the Status Quo in Trade between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Seeking Early Resolution of Anti-Japanese Incidents Involving Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Ambassador Saito Hiroshi Carries New Instructions and is Scheduled to Return to Post Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since returning to Japan on July 17, Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi has visited the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, and the Navy to exchange opinions, and inspected the current situation in "Manchukuo." Now that his official duties have been completed, he is scheduled to take the Chichibu Maru from Yokohama to the United States on the 11th to return to his post. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the upcoming naval conference to be quite serious, and convened the highest-level meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 8th to re-examine the specific policy towards the United States. As a result, the following policy was decided:</p>
<p>(1) Disarmament Countermeasures: The Japanese government will strive to realize Japan's thorough disarmament plan at the naval conference, and at the same time request the United States to understand in order to ensure the smooth establishment of the conference. However, if the situation changes, appropriate measures will be adopted temporarily.</p>
<p>(2) Trade Countermeasures: Based on the spirit of Japanese-American cooperation, efforts will be made to maintain the status quo of Japanese-American trade.</p>
<p>(3) Anti-Japanese Issues: The issue of Arizona's exclusion of Japanese farmers may have a negative impact on Japanese-American diplomacy. The Japanese government trusts the US government and hopes to resolve this issue as soon as possible. However, if the situation worsens, the central government will handle it through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>In addition, the draft instructions carried by Prime Minister Saito will be formally handed over by Foreign Minister Hirota separately. (Nichi-Ren dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Ambassador Saito to the United States returned to Japan, he not only contacted Foreign Minister Hirota, but also exchanged opinions with Prince Saionji and various parties, and inspected the situation in China and Manchuria. It is now scheduled that the Ambassador will return to his post by Chichibu Maru from Yokohama on the 11th. Before the Ambassador's return to his post, he revisited Vice Minister Shigemitsu yesterday and exchanged opinions with Director Horiuchi of the American Bureau, Director Togo of the European and Asian Bureau, and Director Kuwashima of the East Asian Bureau. He further visited Foreign Minister Hirota, who gave him the following important instructions with the following meaning:</p>
<p>Fundamental Policy: There has never been a major conflict of interest between Japan and the United States that could be the cause of war. We are confident that we can fully promote cooperation and friendship. Therefore, it is our fundamental policy to handle and resolve all issues through peaceful means.</p>
<p>Disarmament Issue: The Imperial Government has consistently advocated abandoning the existing Washington Treaty and proposing a fair and appropriate substantive disarmament plan in its place to ensure international peace as the fundamental purpose.</p>
<p>Manchurian Issue: "Manchukuo" is in name and in fact an independent country, and is now fully developing. The solution to the so-called "Manchukuo" issue lies in the candid recognition of this reality by the nations.</p>
<p>China Issue: The Imperial Government is particularly concerned about its special interests in China and has repeatedly stated that it will continue to move towards securing peace in the Far East based on this belief, and highly expects the support of the US government.</p>
<p>Trade Issue: The two countries have mutually beneficial economic relations. If we continue to maintain this friendly spirit, it will be better to increase the mutual trade interests of Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>Immigration Issue: The anti-Japanese immigration law is deeply regretted by the Imperial Government, and we are extremely dissatisfied with incidents such as the one in Arizona. We hope that the American authorities will take appropriate and effective measures to resolve it quickly and satisfactorily, and we hope that they will fully take measures to prevent this from happening in the future.

<p>Japan Decides to Announce the Abolition of the Treaty</p>
<h3 id="e10">Demanding Naval Equality <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(New York) Lieutenant General Yamamoto Isoroku, who was dispatched by the Japanese government to London to participate in the preliminary talks of the naval conference, has arrived here, as reported in yesterday's telegram. Yamamoto recently declared that Japan has a great possibility of demanding naval equality with Britain and the United States, but also said that "Japan also proposes to make efforts to greatly reduce naval armaments." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government officially decided to abolish the Washington Treaty on September 7. Britain and the United States are trying to prevent Japan from announcing the abolition or making it lose the opportunity to abolish it. However, the Japanese government, in accordance with its established policy, will announce the abolition within the year, and will present a new disarmament proposal at the preparatory conference, pointing out the inappropriateness of the Washington Treaty. If the British and American opposition is clear during concrete discussions, the Privy Council will be asked to approve the abolition. The timing will be around late November.

<p>Turkish Bombardment of French Ships</p>
<h3 id="e11">Both Sides Resolve the Issue Satisfactorily <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The French warships that were bombarded by Turkish batteries in the Turkish port of Smyrna have now been resolved to the satisfaction of both sides. French officials announced that the rapid resolution of the case was purely due to the open and frank exchange of views between the two sides after the incident. It is said that the incident occurred because the French Navy Department failed to receive prior notice that foreign warships were prohibited from entering the port. The two French ships, the torpedo boat Gaeba and the destroyer Kaiser, are continuing to sail to Istanbul. The bombardment of the French ships was actually the third time in the past three months that foreign ships have been shot at in Turkish territory. In July of this year, an Italian fishing boat was shot at by Turkish shore troops in the Dodecanese, killing several people. Two weeks later, several officers of the British cruiser Dauntless were shot at while sailing in a yacht near the shore, and Major Robinson was fatally wounded. This is actually the third time. (National Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the bombardment of the French destroyers Cassard and Guepard by the coastal battery in the Turkish port of Smyrna, the Navy Department recently released accurate information, stating that the Turkish battery only fired blank rounds, requesting the French warships to raise their national flags and stop moving forward. The French warships immediately turned back to the Bay of Mytilene to await instructions from the naval authorities. As for the rumors that the French destroyers were shot at and retaliated, they were all unfounded. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Our Silver Protest</p>
<h3 id="e13">American Response Drafted <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Silver Purchase Policy Facilitates Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance's Remarks Can Be Seen as a Side Response</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News stated that the US Treasury Department's remarks on silver policy after China's protest may have to be regarded as insignificant in part, as this is only a side response to one of China's two notes. China's protest has shocked Washington's political circles. No matter how it responds, it seems inevitable that it will disrupt foreign relations or the powerful silver industry in the country. It is heard that Secretary of State Hull has been working diligently on drafting a response for the past week, but it has not yet been completed. Therefore, although yesterday's remarks by officials of the Treasury Department in Washington are a side response to China, they can also be seen as a genuine response. According to an article published by Treasury Department personnel in Washington yesterday, the government's method of buying silver abroad can facilitate foreign exchange and assist foreigners in purchasing American goods and paying off debts to the United States when possible.

<p>Madrid and Barcelona</p>
<p>Sporadic Battles Occur Intermittently</p>
<p>Conditions in Various Places Gradually Return to Normal</p>
<p>Madrid, the government issued an official statement tonight, stating that the civil unrest has been quelled and the government is now in full control of the situation. The current state of the Spanish capital is no different from peacetime, and the traces of the recent unrest have also been completely cleared.</p>
<p>Transportation has also returned to normal. Restaurants have started trading, and factories have also reopened, but the number of workers is still insufficient in many places. The Lerroux cabinet is preparing to attend parliament tomorrow. Lerroux stated that he is quite confident about the future and takes it upon himself to guarantee the unity of Spain. Moreover, after the unrest was quelled, the public's faith in the new government has increased significantly. People generally believe that the Lerroux cabinet's measures have made great contributions to maintaining national unity. According to news from Asturias and Galicia provinces, the situation there has not changed, and the rebels have not been completely eliminated. In Ferrol and Corunna, battles occurred last night. Work in Catalonia, such as the provincial capital Barcelona, has resumed. Active repairs are underway on telephone and telegraph communications with Asturias. (8th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid, at midnight, the capital regained its tranquility. The future situation is more optimistic. The Socialist Party has apparently realized that there is no chance of winning the war. Railway traffic throughout the country, except for that in Asturias, has been restored. After a lengthy cabinet meeting, it was announced that military trials would be held today. Most of the captured individuals will be tried in Barcelona and severely punished according to the law, without any leniency. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Sporadic Battles Continue in Two Major Cities</p>
<p>Barcelona, the foreign legion from Spanish North Africa arrived here today. The residents were overjoyed and defied the night curfew, thronging the streets to welcome them, shouting "Long Live Spain!" Although sporadic battles are still ongoing, the army is now able to control the overall situation. Two battalions of the foreign legion have rushed to Sabadell, where the revolutionaries are currently putting up a stubborn resistance. The Minister of Interior in Madrid issued a statement saying that the revolution has completely failed.</p>
<p>This time, it relied on the people of the capital abiding by their civic duties and the brave defense force of Oviedo fighting valiantly for the country. The Socialist Party's plan to occupy the capital and Asturias failed. Now, only small groups of rebels outside Oviedo are still causing trouble.</p>
<p>This morning, scattered skirmishes continued in the capital and Barcelona, but there were no fierce battles. Postal and telegraph services are gradually returning to normal.</p>
<p>(9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid, incidents continue to occur in the capital and outer provinces, resulting in five deaths and more than twenty injuries. Transportation in the northern part of Madrid province is still difficult, and news is arriving very slowly. In Oviedo province, government troops have been dispatched and have suppressed several rebellious villages. In San Sebastian, twenty-two Socialist Party members hiding in residential houses were arrested. When they were arrested, they fired shots at the police from inside the house. The owners of all taxi companies in the capital received orders to have their taxis operate as usual before noon today. Those who violate this order will have their taxi permits revoked. The situation in the capital appears the same as yesterday morning. Public transport vehicles are still operating under military protection, but the number of vehicles seems to have increased. Shops in the city center have fully opened. According to a report in the "Qingyi Daily," former Premier Azaña and former Basque Provincial Governor Carvino have been summoned to court on suspicion of smuggling arms. The telegram also stated that all the arms of the revolutionaries were shipped from Germany. In total, the number of deaths has reached thirty-three. By evening, the entire city had outwardly returned to normal, and evening newspapers were published at their usual times. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Spanish Capital</p>

<p>Rebels Occupy Outer Provinces of Catalonia</p>
<p>Planes Guide Warships to Shell</p>
<p>Government Strictly Prevents New Incidents from Occurring</p>
<p>Madrid, fierce fighting broke out again here this evening.</p>
<p>The overall situation has clearly worsened. The outer provinces of Catalonia are still in the hands of the rebels. The rebels hiding in the mountains east of Gijón are being shelled by warships guided by planes. It is widely believed that the Socialist Party will stage a violent coup tonight. A general railway strike will take place tomorrow. The Anarchist Party, which belongs to the National Confederation of Labor, is now also supporting the strike initiated by the Socialist Party. This movement has now spread to Andalusia, where the Anarchist Party has a strong influence, thus increasing the government's difficulties. The cabinet is meeting today and will probably decide to order the mobilization of the reserves of the First and Second Army to deal with the serious situation. If this happens, all men in the country under the age of thirty-nine will have to enlist.</p>
<p>Fascist Party leader Rivera, the son of the late Spanish dictator, visited Premier Lerroux today and offered to have his 60,000 party members at his disposal.</p>
<p>Tonight's fighting in the capital resulted in seven deaths, including two waiters from a famous cafe. At that time, bullets were flying across Sol Street, and the windows of the post office were shattered. The authorities are now worried that people, due to the lack of food, will gather to loot gun shops. There is currently no flour, bread, or potatoes in the city, and many residents are relying only on powdered milk to survive.</p>
<p>The government is deeply concerned that the general railway strike will take place tomorrow, so it has taken preemptive measures to implement military control over all railways and summon all railway reserve personnel to serve. Railway workers will naturally be subject to military law and will be shot immediately if they resist in the slightest.</p>
<p>According to the latest news, the situation in the Asturias mining area is still not good. The strikers have weapons, and it is feared that they also have artillery. Currently, telephone lines have been cut, and roads have been destroyed. The terrain there is rugged and mountainous, making it very difficult to advance.</p>
<p>Two thousand five hundred soldiers, mostly Spanish foreign legionnaires, arrived in Gijón in Oviedo province by ship from Morocco today. Some of the rebels are now hiding in the mountains east of Gijón and are being heavily shelled by warships.</p>
<p>A general strike has been declared in Málaga in Granada province. The militia is engaged in street fighting with the strikers. The barracks of the militia in Barruelo in Valencia province was bombed by the rebels today. All the family members of the militia who were sheltering in the barracks were killed. An orphanage for miners run by nuns in Barruelo was also bombed by the rebels, killing many orphans and nuns.</p>
<p>Two thousand reinforcements have been dispatched to Tarragona to deal with any incidents that may occur in Catalonia. The government forces there have so far suffered nine deaths and thirty-seven injuries. Many government offices in Catalonia are storing arms. Today, government forces in Barcelona searched the Interior Department and found 1,000 rifles, eight boxes of bombs, 125 boxes of explosives, and countless small arms.</p>
<p>Two regiments of the Spanish foreign legion arrived in Barcelona today. Although the government claims that the overall situation in Catalonia is under its control, the true situation remains unclear to everyone. However, residents of Barcelona can now go out, but when passing shops, they must raise both hands to show that they have no other intentions. Although the outer provinces of Catalonia are still occupied by the rebels, the government is confident that it can soon subdue the rebels. However, the strikers in that area are resisting more fiercely, and the future is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Today, in Asturias, a motor vehicle carrying troops was bombed by the rebels, killing fifty-two people. The number of deaths and injuries nationwide is still unknown, but it is estimated that the number of deaths is over five hundred and the number of injuries is about two thousand.</p>
<p>The military court will probably open the trial tomorrow. The arrested rebels will probably be sentenced to death, but the leaders will likely be treated with leniency.</p>
<p>If they are executed, they will be regarded as martyrs by the public.</p>
<p>The rebels in Mondragon near San Sebastian built</p>
<p>a wooden架, placed in front of the city hall, saying that all those who refuse to obey would be</p>
<p>hanged in public. The rebels also threatened to execute the captured militia by hanging. Near Seville, a 16th-century ancient church was burned down by rioters. The precious works of art it contained were all destroyed. In Navas, fifty miles from Barcelona, extremists arrested a priest, poured oil on his body, and set him on fire. As the priest screamed in pain from the fire, the crowd applauded and cheered, taking pleasure in it. Also, in San Vicente, a priest narrowly escaped the same fate. The rioters then turned their anger on the church he presided over and set it on fire.</p>
<p>The female operators at the Madrid telephone exchange have been staying at the exchange for four days. Currently, one line connects to Paris and one line connects to London. However, the two lines from London and Paris to Barcelona have been cut by the rebels. Fortunately, the army arrived in time, so the water supply to Barcelona was not cut off by the rebels. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid, street fighting continued all night, greatly undermining the official atmosphere of optimism. According to reliable sources, the government suspects that there will be new incidents in the situation and is now on high alert. It is heard that the strike leaders will order railway workers to strike. The government is now conscripting reserves to suppress them. Once the railway workers go on strike, they can come out to maintain the railway administration and at least support some of the transportation. According to the official newspaper, about 500 rebels who fled into the mountains have surrendered to the Central Army. It is also heard that former Socialist Party Finance Minister Prieto was arrested for participating in the Catalan coup. It is heard that former Premier Azaña has escaped. According to reliable sources, Azaña and two Catalan deputies and left-wing figures have crossed the border and fled to France. The government attended parliament today. Although the left-wing parties have decided not to participate in the meeting to boycott the government, parliament will continue to meet on schedule in the future. Premier Lerroux denied to reporters that the military court in Barcelona had sentenced anyone to death. (9th Guomin Telegram)</p>

<p>Leaders Arrested, Remaining Troops Surrender with Weapons</p>
<p>Madrid, the rebels are now gradually surrendering, but in the workers' gathering place in the northern Asturias province, there are still remnants who are stubbornly resisting. According to government estimates, the Socialist Party spent as much as four million pesos preparing for this uprising. Interior Minister Vallejo declared that the rebellion has been suppressed. The cabinet has also urged the competent authorities to quickly organize military courts. There are still sporadic skirmishes in some areas of the capital tonight, and the number of deaths and injuries is unknown. It is generally known that the rebels have the latest weapons. The leader of the Socialist Party in parliament, Jiménez, has now been arrested. Machine guns are still placed in some locations in Seville. There were many shootings in Bilbao, resulting in four deaths. Striking workers have destroyed many factories. In Algeciras, the rebels announced a revolutionary strike.

<p>Lisbon, several anti-government figures have recently been detained, including some military officers. Telephone communication between here and Madrid is again disrupted.

<p>Regarding the incidents in Spain, the Premier decided to strictly guard the border. If any rebels cross the border, the local authorities should designate a residence for them in a remote location, treating them as foreign political prisoners.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the reform of the institutions stationed in Manchuria, as a result of discussions at the cabinet meeting on the 9th, it was generally agreed that it is no longer appropriate to have the commander of the military police concurrently serve as the chief of police. However, the strongest opposition this time was to the issue of police militarization.</p>
<p>Therefore, the police should not be turned into military police, and concrete methods should be adopted to demonstrate this outwardly, and the details should be implemented in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome. The opinions of the cabinet members on this have become consistent. (9th Japan United News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before the cabinet meeting this morning at 9:50, Army Minister Hayashi met with Premier Okada at the Premier's residence and strongly advocated the legitimacy of the Army's plan. If it is revised, it will inevitably provoke the issue of political responsibility and expose the government's fickleness. Because the Army Minister's attitude was so strong, Premier Okada was in a dilemma. (9th China United News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Vice-Minister of Colonial Affairs Tsubogami drafted a compromise plan to resolve the dispute between the Army Ministry and the police officers of the Kwantung Government.

Therefore, Premier Okada, who is also the Minister of Colonial Affairs, has a responsibility that cannot be ignored.

<p>(London) The general public believes that President Roosevelt's currency experiment has now concluded, so they are rushing to buy US dollars.</p>
<p>The pound has therefore weakened again and again, which is one of the reasons why the price of gold continues to rise and reach new heights. Today's gold price is 142 shillings and 9 pence, which is 13 pence higher than the price of four dollars and nine cents and three-seventy-five, and eight and a half pence higher than the price of 74 francs. European operators are vying to buy gold, fearing that countries using the gold standard will be forced to abandon it, and the situation in Belgium is also causing suspicion. According to them, if countries using the gold standard abandon it, the pound will be even more affected. Therefore, in this environment, the general sentiment seems to be that the pound will continue to decline and the price of gold will continue to rise. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>Promote Politics with Emphasis on Rural Construction</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Chairman Chiang, at 7:00 AM on the 8th, summoned Wang Shuchang, Commander of the Pingjin Garrison, and Guo Chiping, Chief of Staff of the Western Route Army Headquarters of the Five Provinces, to the Xingyuan (temporary headquarters). After inquiring about their situation, he crossed the river at 8:30 AM to attend the General Headquarters Expansion Anniversary Week. Senior personnel from the Party, government, military, police, and academia first gathered at the headquarters. At 9:00 AM, Chiang arrived in full military uniform amidst solemn silence, leading the attendees in formal salutations. He then delivered an admonishment, the original text of which has been organized and published as follows:</p>
<p>"Deputy Commander Zhang, esteemed officers, today I have come to Wuhan and happened to coincide with the Premier's Memorial Week. I would like to take this opportunity to share my observations with everyone. I haven't been to Wuhan for a long time. This time, upon inspection, I have seen great progress in all aspects, whether political, military, police, or municipal. It is evident that all military and civilian officials have been working together diligently to fulfill their duties. Judging from the current state of Wuhan, the future of the country is certainly filled with great hope, and we will definitely be able to achieve our goal of saving the nation. This is something that brings me great comfort. However, no undertaking, especially in politics, can hope for great success overnight. To achieve great things, one must be able to uphold the spirit of 'unceasing self-improvement,' and continue to work hard. On one hand, we must strive for progress day by day, and on the other hand, we must accumulate gains day by day. Only in this way can politics be fundamentally transformed. Then, the foundation of everything in politics can be built day by day according to the goals of our ideology. Although the political foundation in Wuhan has not yet been firmly established, it can be said that a preliminary framework has already been formed. Now that we have such a framework, as long as everyone can make progress in spirit day by day, I believe that in the future, all reform and construction efforts in politics, military affairs, society, and education will be able to advance simultaneously. We will certainly be able to lay a solid foundation to fulfill our mission of saving the nation. Regarding the political measures in Hubei, when I was about to leave Wuhan in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), I promulgated the 'Eighteen Articles for the Reorganization of Hubei Politics.' Now, two years have passed. Based on this outline, I have examined and found that although many things have been done and there has been great progress and achievement, there are still many things that have not been done, or even started. In fact, the things in the outline are the most urgent and simplest preliminary measures. Now that two years have passed and they have not been fully implemented, I, as the person who promulgated the outline, feel very ashamed. Therefore, today I will recite these eighteen articles again, hoping that everyone can work together to fully realize them in the future. 1. Implement the system of administrative supervisory commissioners, ensuring that they can fully exercise their powers. Prudence in the selection of county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs, their performance should be thoroughly evaluated, guaranteed, and strict reward and punishment regulations should be enforced.</p>
<p>2.  The existing police and local self-defense security teams in each county should be strictly reorganized, their organization improved, their numbers verified, their source of funding secured, and their public or private firearms guaranteed. They should be thoroughly trained, with special emphasis on political knowledge and martial arts. 4. After the security teams and other local self-defense teams in each county have been reorganized, the term of service for conscripts in each county, including regular, reserve, and auxiliary forces, should be stipulated, and jurisdictions should be divided to integrate internal affairs into military orders. The Security Department should prepare an implementation plan and proceed in phases. The first phase of the reorganization work should be completed by March of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). 5. Implement the household registration system based on the Regulations for Compiling and Investigating Baojia Household Registration, and ensure that the compilation and investigation are completed within the prescribed time limit according to the compilation and investigation schedule. In case of special circumstances that make it impossible to complete the process within the prescribed time limit, a factual report may be submitted for approval to extend the deadline, but the extension should not exceed March of the 22nd year of the Republic. The entire province must complete the process uniformly, and a review should be conducted from May to September of the same year. 6.</p>
<p>Except for the budgets of the Hubei Provincial Government and the Hankou Municipal Government, which have been reviewed and approved, the revenue and expenditure of all local expenses of the county governments and their affiliated agencies throughout the province should be compiled into formal budgets, submitted to the Department of Finance for review and approval, and promulgated for implementation. Starting from February of next year, all expenses should be implemented in accordance with the new budget. 7. The establishment of the Provincial Farmers Bank and credit cooperatives in each county should be preliminarily completed by March of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). 8. The land survey should be completed within five years, but the preliminary plan for the first year of the 22nd year of the Republic should be stipulated as soon as possible. 9. All financial institutions should immediately implement the accounting system. 10. All levels of financial personnel must obtain guarantees, and the competent authorities should conduct thorough supervision at all times. If there is any case of embezzlement or fraud, they should be strictly pursued for compensation and punished according to the law. 11. The Provincial Department of Construction should temporarily prepare a one-year road construction plan and proceed in phases. The first phase of work should be completed by March of the 22nd year of the Republic. 12. Hubei's dike and water conservancy projects should be transferred to the National Economic Commission for unified planning, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, affiliated with the commission, should be responsible for management, in order to save expenses and prevent overflow. 13. In the counties of Hubei, especially in the bandit-affected areas, in addition to striving for rural revitalization in accordance with the Land Management Regulations and the Rural Cooperative Regulations, appropriate areas should be selected to establish collective farms to test the latest farming and management methods. 14. Primary and secondary school education should stimulate students' national consciousness in various courses and cultivate the spirit of sacrifice for the country. 15. Primary and junior high schools should conduct military training for boy scouts. 16. Schools above junior high school should emphasize military education and militarize students' lives. 17. The literacy movement for civilians should be planned for one year by the Department of Education, starting from Hankou. 18. All levels of judicial organs should complete the clearing of lawsuits within a time limit. In the future, civil and criminal lawsuits should be concluded within one month in accordance with legal procedures, so as not to burden the people with litigation." The eighteen articles were the outline for the reorganization of Hubei politics that were established at that time. Among them, there are several very important things, such as compiling and investigating baojia household registration, measuring land, compiling formal local budgets for each county, promoting cooperative enterprises in each county, and establishing collective farms. Some of these have not been done well, or have not yet started. It is hoped that they can be actively implemented in the future and completed as soon as possible. It is not just the civil affairs officials who should work hard to do this. All senior military officers in the areas where they are stationed should also implement all political measures within their respective areas, cooperate with local civil affairs officials, and earnestly follow the outline. Do not think that these matters belong exclusively to the scope of civil affairs and that military officers can ignore them. Only in this way can politics and military affairs advance together, bandit suppression can be thoroughly successful, and all localities can have a truly clear and bright day. This is the meaning of hoping that all military and civilian officials will work together in the future to earnestly implement the matters stipulated in the outline for the reorganization of Hubei politics. Secondly, as a result of the observations in recent days, although Wuhan has made great progress in all aspects, there are still several points that need special attention in any aspect, whether political, military, municipal, or military affairs. First, whatever we do, we must pay attention to reality, be consistent inside and out, and not just talk about a superficial form. For example, in terms of the cleanliness of roads, the roads are generally cleaner everywhere now, but if you look at the secluded places on both sides of the roads, there are still inevitably dirty places. Scraps of paper and garbage are scattered everywhere. Also, like the situation in ordinary agencies throughout China, things look generally neat on the surface, but if you go inside and take a look at the kitchen and the toilets, many of them are unbearably dirty. These places, which are most prone to the spread of germs and infectious diseases, are not paid attention to by people who only care about form and not substance. This accumulated habit is really a common problem of the Chinese people. For example, an ordinary family often only sweeps the middle of the house, and the corners of the walls and doors are never swept. The life of a Chinese family is like this, and the same is true for everything in society and politics. Therefore, I want to specifically raise this point today and talk to everyone, asking everyone to correct it if they have it, and to encourage themselves if they don't. In the future, no matter what you do, you must pay attention to reality. You, as the leading officers, must pay extra attention to the places where malpractices are most likely to occur, which others are most negligent of, and which are actually the most important to rectify. This is a fundamental key to our work.</p>
<p>The same is true in politics, military affairs, and society. For example, when leading troops, you should not only know how to drill every day, take classes, or conduct routine inspections of internal affairs. You must pay close attention to the management and hygiene of all aspects, especially the toilets and kitchens. You should be diligent in inspecting these places. As for the things that the Public Security Bureau manages, they are especially complicated, and everything must be based on facts. For example, in terms of cleanliness, have all the public security bureaus and posts in Wuhan thoroughly met the requirements of cleanliness? I hope that you, as the leading officers, will pay extra attention to this. This is about striving for reality in doing things. Second, all our measures should not only pay attention to cities in the future, but also pay more attention to rural areas and remote alleys. For example, the roads in Wuhan are very clean now, and the New Life Movement has been implemented step by step. As long as everyone can continue to work hard in the future, there is no need to worry about not doing well. However, our work is not just about improving cities. You should know that the affairs of cities are only one or two percent of our entire work.</p>
<p>The remaining 98 or 99 percent are in the counties and rural areas. What is the situation in the county seats and rural areas of Hubei now? According to what I have seen during my inspection, the state of disorder and uncleanliness is not only similar to what it was before the 21st year of the Republic, but also no different from what it was thirty or forty years ago. It can be said that there has been no progress at all. Not to mention the situation in other places, even in Wuhan, everything in the city, whether it is roads, parks, police administration, finance, or education, has progressed, and the form is very impressive. However, as long as you go a little further, such as to the areas of Hankou and Liujiamiao, there are especially many poor people and dilapidated thatched huts. Although a road has been opened, the nearby streets have not been improved. Drains and other facilities related to public health and social education that are beneficial to the general poor people have not been paid attention to at all. Little do they know that if you do not pay attention to these places, various problems are likely to occur. In this way, even if the city is doing very well, there will be no complete success. Moreover, any knowledgeable person, whether Chinese or foreign, will never only pay attention to the facilities in the city when they look at our politics. They will definitely pay extra attention to how you are doing in rural areas and whether you are paying attention to the welfare of the general poor people. Yesterday, I met two foreigners who were inspecting there. At a glance, they knew that the Chinese government only focuses on the roads in the city and does not pay attention to the rural areas outside the city, and cannot seek benefits for the general poor people. Also, the New Life Movement that we are doing now is not only about improving the lives of the general people in the city. The purpose is to make the lives of all citizens in the country, from large cities to remote villages, regardless of men, women, old, young, rich, or poor, universally improved, so that they can meet the conditions of "neatness," "cleanliness," "simplicity," "frugality," "promptness," and "certainty," and conform to the spirit of propriety, righteousness. Therefore, everyone must pay special attention to the countryside and the most poor and dirty places in the future, and think of various ways to improve them first, and create more benefits for the most poor people. This is the second point that I hope everyone will pay special attention to in the future. Third, we must do things from top to bottom and use the spirit of diligence to make up for the lack of material things. Nowadays, people generally want money first for everything. They say that they cannot do anything without money. This statement is generally considered reasonable, but it is actually wrong. Many ordinary things do not necessarily require money to do. For example, to make a place clean, it does not necessarily require building a sewer. It is also possible to simply dig open ditches to drain flowing water. This thing does not necessarily require money to do. We can just draw a line through the police and assign the local baojia chiefs or street chiefs to be responsible for each household to dig it.</p>
<p>Wouldn't that be a success? Even if the people do not have working tools, we can provide them with tools from the police station and lend them to them. That doesn't cost much money either. For example, the last two weeks, I walked through a place in Hukou and other counties, and there were many usable stone strips lying around randomly. The county government did not pay any attention to organizing them. When I asked him, he said that he had no money and could not start. In fact, these things do not need any money. As long as the county magistrate pays a little attention and asks the village and town baojia chiefs to guide the general people to spend a little effort and organize them, many national objects can be used, and many unclean places can be cleaned up. Things like this are all the chronic diseases of the Chinese people from top to bottom. We must thoroughly change them in the future. We must understand that the ability of our revolutionaries is to be able to lead the general people by setting an example and using the spirit of diligence and hard work to make up for our lack of material things. Even if we do not have money, we can do things well. We must also understand that land is money, and the labor of the people is even more of a resource for production. As long as we can think of ways to make full use of the land to increase production and use the people's labor to transform society, we can do many things without money. Guanzi's saying "to teach the people to be strong by death, and to teach the people to be rich by labor" means that we want to make the country and the general people strong, we must make them understand the great righteousness of life and death, break through the barrier of life and death, and be able to cultivate their spirit of courage to sacrifice for the country. The latter sentence is to make the people accustomed to labor. Therefore, the meaning of "the people's livelihood lies in diligence" is that the government should be good at using the people's labor to increase the welfare of the people themselves. Nowadays, people generally think that to do a career, they must first have money, and then they must think of ways to raise money, levy taxes, and exploit the people. Little do they know that if a person cannot do anything without money, this person will definitely not be able to do anything even with money. Moreover, to exploit money from the people is to exploit them to the point of completion and to destroy the country. Only by making good use of the people's labor to increase the interests of the people themselves is the right way to revolutionary construction. Only by making good use of labor is it beneficial and inexpensive, and inexhaustible. Only by using it to increase the welfare of the people themselves will it be hard work without complaint and inexhaustible use. Therefore, the Nanchang Xingying had a circular order stipulating that every strong man should do three days of work for the country every year.</p>
<p>If this method can be universally implemented, each county, excluding the old, young, and women, will have an average of 50,000 strong men. Each county will have 150,000 obligatory laborers every year. As long as the government can use them with a reasonable plan, whether it is for repairing dikes, dredging rivers, or building roads, isn't it</p>
<p>Continued on page thirteen</p>
<h2>Page 13</h2>
<p>There is a large project that can be completed. This method of conscripting labor,</p>
<p>In the beginning, for two or three years, the government may have to force it. After a few years, the people will get real benefits and become accustomed to it. Naturally, they will trust the government and be able to automatically contribute to the country and to public welfare without the government forcing them. If this continues year after year, what construction projects cannot be successful? How can the general public not be well-off? The ancients have already told us the principle of "teaching the people to be rich through labor." It is only because the general public cannot understand and implement it now that they always say that they cannot do anything without money. Therefore, today I would like to specifically mention it. In addition, there is one more point that I would like to add, that is, when we use the people's labor, we must allocate it properly and regulate it appropriately. We must carefully consider the location, time, and work used, and we must study the methods of management and utilization so that the people's labor will not only not be misused and wasted, but also be able to generate the greatest effect. For example, in terms of the location where the people's labor is used, it is generally based on the principle of using it in the local area. What happens in a certain place is where labor is conscripted, and where labor is conscripted is used for the benefit of that place. Only in this way can the people's labor be used most effectively, and it can also make the general public work hard without complaint. What I have said above is about striving for reality in doing things, being consistent inside and out, second, paying attention to the countryside in all political facilities, and creating welfare for the general civilians, and third, being consistent from top to bottom and helping the lack of material things with the spirit of diligence. These are the few points that I would like to contribute to everyone today, and they can also be said to be my thoughts on this trip to Wuhan. The rest of the words cannot be said all at once.</p>
<p>I hope that everyone can understand the meaning of what I have said today, follow the items stipulated in the Hubei Political Reorganization Outline, earnestly study them, and work together to do them. Now that we have this scale, we will definitely be able to make progress day by day in the future. I hope that Hubei can build a</p>
<p>A strong foundation for saving the country. I sincerely hope that everyone will work hard and wish everyone good health.</p>

<p>Bandit Leader</p>
<h3 id="e86">Peng Dehuai's Confession <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Signs of Total Collapse of Bandit Army</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: During the Battle of Lei Bo Ridge, the National Army seized a counterfeit training order from bandit leader Peng Dehuai when it killed Zhang Sheng, the battalion commander of the pseudo-Third Division. It described the influence of the surrender and betrayal of secret information by the pseudo-officers and soldiers, as well as the disintegration of the bandit army.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the time for their total collapse is not far away. In order to clarify the internal truth of the bandit army for those who are concerned about suppressing bandits, we have specially extracted a few sections of the original text of the pseudo-training order as follows: (1) The corps commander (Peng Bandit's self-proclaimed title) correctly estimated the enemy's (referring to the National Army, the same below) situation on the evening of the 26th, and issued the combat order for the 27th. On the evening of the 27th, the order was supplemented by two telephone calls, stipulating that the combat preparation should be completed before 4 o'clock, and stipulating the continuous action of reconnaissance and observation posts against the enemy. However, all departments did not report on the approach of the enemy overnight. Furthermore, after the Third Battalion of the Fourteenth Regiment entered the position, they took off their equipment and went to sleep. Only four sentries were dispatched on the right flank.</p>
<p>The sound of the explosion of hand grenades thrown into the bunker by the enemy awakened them from their dreams. The regiment's machine guns did not enter the position at all. The regiment's second echelon was still drilling outdoors and was blocked by the enemy's artillery and air strikes and could not be reinforced. The position of the Thirty-ninth Regiment of the Thirteenth Division only had a small post, and there were no soldiers guarding it.</p>
<p>These serious slackness and negligence gave the enemy the opportunity to attack. Therefore, the position of the Third Battalion of the Fourteenth Regiment was closed off by the enemy without firing a shot.</p>
<p>The throat of the fortress, a solid fortification, was completely given to the enemy in only 30 minutes. (2) The enemy attacked from the Dalingge section where the Fourteenth Regiment and the Thirty-ninth Regiment joined.</p>
<p>When the Fifth Division urgently requested assistance from the Thirty-ninth Regiment, it was discovered that there was no one in the position of the Thirty-ninth Regiment at all. When Baohushan was in danger, the Second Battalion Commander of the Twelfth Regiment wanted to ask for help from the neighboring troops, but he did not know where the neighboring troops were. Baohushan had been lost for a long time, and the enemy was threatening the right flank of Wannianting, but the Thirteenth Regiment still did not know the situation on the right wing. Especially before the enemy reached the position, the assault team did not attack. (3) The enemy-surrendered members of the candle-shaped defensive team told the enemy about the candle-shaped concealed machine gun bunker and the buried landmines, so that the enemy's planes destroyed the machine gun bunker when they began to attack, and the landmines were easily destroyed by the enemy. The enemy-surrendered platoon leader of Dalingge told the enemy that the left wing of the Thirty-ninth Regiment's position was empty and that the junction's alert was weak.</p>
<p>Told the enemy and led the enemy to attack from this side," After our repeated encirclement and suppression, the officers and soldiers of the bandit army deeply felt the personal material suffering, and the experience of blindly following communism for several years,</p>
<p>Deeply knew that it was not suitable for our national conditions, and they all realized it. However, because</p>
<p>Under the cruel surveillance of the bandit party, there was no chance to get rid of it. Therefore, whenever the National Army advanced and approached, they carried their weapons and surrendered one after another. However, the bandit leaders were still deaf and self-righteous, and did not introspect. They blamed the failure on the slackness of the various departments of the bandit army, and wanted to use a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Wen, no matter how much the military's morale has been lost, deceiving oneself and others, and further exposing his desolate rubber and urging his collapse. (7th)</p>

<p>丨Wang Jun Leads Troops to Tunxi丨</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Luo Binghui faction, gathered a crowd of about three thousand people, and suddenly sneaked into Anhui a month ago, causing great disturbances. Various parties have sent teams to encircle and suppress them, and they have gradually disintegrated. In addition to dispatching Cai Bingyan, the director of the Security Department of the Anhui Provincial Government, to lead the Security Regiment to Tunxi for garrison, Wang Jun, the commander of the Seventh Army, was also ordered by Chairman Chiang,</p>
<p>Personally went to Anhui to supervise the suppression in order to completely annihilate them. Wang arrived in Wuhu by car from Beijing this afternoon. He met with representatives of the Huizhou Association in Wuhu and military and political officers. At 6:00 PM in the evening, he took a train from Xuancheng directly to Tunxi. According to Wang, the Luo bandits were severely attacked by his troops head-on in Yucun, Shicheng and other places in Huizhou, and a large number of them were killed. Even more were captured and wounded. According to the captured bandits, the role definitely killed</p>
<p>Two pseudo-division commanders, and now they have lost their ability to resist, so the remnants have fled back to the deep mountains on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi. The security of Huizhou,</p>
<p>There is no problem at all. I am going to Tunxi under orders to command the troops and track down the Qing Dynasty, so I will stay in Tunxi for no more than two weeks. (8th)</p>

<p>丨Bandits Kill Village Leaders Out of Revenge丨</p>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou reports that the remaining bandits in the Chaozhou and Meizhou region have recently shown signs of resurgence as the main forces have moved to develop the Fujian-Jiangxi border area. Zhang Ruigui's division, stationed in Puning Liusha, and Chen Yaoshu's regiment entered Nanshan on September 27th to suppress the bandits. The first battalion encountered bandits in Xikeng, killing 14 on the spot. The remaining bandits scattered and fled into the deep mountains of Chizhuya.</p>
<p>The Sixth District of Chaoyang, including Shifo, Shenyang, Wai (Outer), Nei (Inner), and Ba Villages, is connected to Beishan. It is rumored that many of the bandits from Nanshan have fled into Beishan, which is located at the border of Jieyang and Puning. Therefore, Zhang's division destroyed the watchtowers in Nanyang, Wujiao, Dakeng, and other villages in Beishan. However, the bandits are now gathering on Yanquanling, Fangshan, Erfangshan, and the highest peak of Beishan (five miles from Dakeng).</p>
<p>At night, villagers can remotely see the bandits' flashlight beams and hear their gunshots. Moreover, bandits occasionally visit villages to give speeches and distribute reactionary propaganda songs and publications, causing great panic among the residents of more than ten nearby villages. The Houxigang port of Chaoyang faces the Shantou sea from a distance. Recently, a ship carrying seafood to Shantou was attacked by a bandit ship with weapons in front of the Qingyu Leprosarium, resulting in significant losses for the seafood merchants. The Haimenzhen Hefeng and other firms have petitioned the county government's squadron headquarters to strictly investigate and prosecute the robbers. On the 28th, the garrison in Guanbu Barracks, Chaoyang, executed six communist bandits, including Chen Yaqin, by firing squad as a warning to the public. As for the Putoubu Village in Qiupu Township, Fourth District of Chaoan County, on the 28th of last month,</p>
<p>it was invaded by over a hundred bandits who surrounded the residence of the village leader, Chen Yumei.</p>
<p>Chen, who was already asleep, was captured on the spot and shot to death.</p>
<p>Chen's wife, Ding, was also killed. The bandits then left with shouts and whistles. It is heard that the bandits specifically target district and village leaders for revenge because these leaders are quite capable of assisting the government in organizing and training militia to suppress bandits. Moreover, Dazhai Township in the Seventh District has also been subjected to bandit raids, causing widespread panic. The Luo Ji battalion stationed in Jinsha Township in the district believes that the district's reserve team is incompetent and should be entirely replaced with newly selected militia. On the 31st, Battalion Commander Luo went to the Dazhai Township Office and convened a security meeting attended by 26 village leaders. It was resolved that gatehouses and walls should be built in the strategic locations of the township within ten days, and each village should send ten militiamen to patrol and stand guard every night. This should be completed within three days. All firearms must also be replaced with better ones, with the village leader being responsible. Village leaders who store good firearms and fail to report them will be charged with collaborating with the bandits. All township offices and Shangguanlu Village should install telephones to facilitate communication and report bandit alerts. The</p>
<p>Shangguanlu Village watchtower should be reinforced with defensive works within three days and fitted with iron gatehouses within fifteen days. Watchtowers on the sides of all township offices should be constructed immediately to prepare for unforeseen events. Furthermore, County Magistrate Liang of Fengshun arrived in Shantou yesterday and stated that the remaining bandits in the mountains of Fengshun only come down to the villages at night to steal food and are not a major concern.</p>
<p>The bandits transferred by the Second Regiment Headquarters in Tangkeng to the county government for imprisonment include communist bandits Deng Ronghua and Liu Geng, both only thirteen years old and still wet behind the ears. They have no idea what politics and ideology are. There is an intention to release them separately. As for the female communist bandits Jian Azhen, Lan Wangshi, Lan Zhengshi, and Guan Lanshi, they are all mountain villagers who gather firewood and herd pigs and were forcibly hired by the bandits to carry goods. Although they are in prison, release is possible. On the 29th, the Third Battalion stationed in the county executed six communist bandits, including Huang Xuan, by firing squad. The Fengshun Lukou bridges, which were washed away by floods last month, have now been rebuilt. The Lengshuikeng section of the Fengliu Road has been completed, and four bridges on the Fengtang Road have also been temporarily repaired.</p>
<p>All roads are passable. There are some remaining bandits led by Gu Dacun in Yetian, Menxi, Hanxi, and other places. The Fifth Company of Meixian, in coordination with the Wang Minduo Battalion stationed in Fengshun, went to suppress them. On September 25th, they fought a major battle with the bandits on Menxi Mountain. The military and police charged to the mountaintop, and the bandits scattered and fled. The military and police then seized military blankets and left. (2nd)</p>

<p>Extortionists Sent to Court for Review</p>
<p>Wang Baoyuan, a resident of Xita Alley in this city, suddenly received a threatening letter demanding 300 yuan. The case was reported to the Second Precinct, and Inspector Lang, along with the detective team, ambushed and apprehended two youths, Lu Jiuxian and Yu Yaozhang, at the Release Pond. During interrogation, both denied sending the extortion letter. However, their handwriting was compared on the spot, and Yu Yaozhang's handwriting closely resembled that of the original letter. Inspector Lang was dispatched to Yu Yaozhang's home to collect evidence. Two envelopes with the inscription "Confidential, Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang" were found on his desk, matching the format of the original extortion letter. They were taken back for investigation. However, Lu Jiuxian and Wang Baoyuan are cousins on their mothers' side. Lu Jiuxian</p>
<p>had previously borrowed money from his aunt (Wang Baoyuan's mother) and always had his wishes granted. Now, unfortunately, he has gone astray. His aunt is kind-hearted and could not bear it. She requested the Public Security Bureau to be lenient and exempt him from investigation. However, the Public Security Bureau stated that the case involved extortion and was related to local security, and the request was denied. After recording their statements, the case was formally submitted to the County Court Prosecutor's Office for review yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e102">New Broadcasting Studio of Provincial Telephone Bureau Completed <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The broadcasting studio of the Zhejiang Provincial Broadcasting Station was originally located in the Provincial Government. Due to the simple construction of the building and the lack of acoustic principles, the broadcast could not be as satisfactory as possible. The location was also unsuitable, and it was inconvenient for people from all parties to go to the station to broadcast. It is now known that the station, in order to actively reorganize, has built a new broadcasting studio on the northeast corner of the open space behind the Telephone Bureau on Huanxing Road. The construction is exquisite, and the equipment is perfect. It is divided into broadcasting studio, monitoring room, reception room, and office. The height, depth, and width of the broadcasting studio are also built according to the principles of sound, in a ratio of two, three, and five.</p>
<p>The broadcasting studio is also equipped with soundproof panels to prevent outside noise from entering. In addition, it is also equipped with broadcasting signal lights to indicate the actions of the broadcasting staff.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned new broadcasting studio was completed last month. The station has started broadcasting in the new broadcasting studio from the 1st of this month. The station also invited people from all walks of life to visit on Double Tenth Day.</p>

<p>Two Major Naval Constructions</p>
<h3 id="e113">Dockyard and Aircraft Factory Completed Simultaneously <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Grand Ceremony Held Today</p>
<p>The Navy Department's Third Large Dockyard and the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant will hold a joint completion ceremony at the same time this morning.</p>
<p>The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e114">Completion of the Third Dockyard <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy originally had two docks. The first one is 550 feet long and the second is 402 feet long. However, these two docks are not suitable for building and repairing larger and longer ships. Years ago, the Naval Commander Chen Shaokuan,</p>
<p>Because of the plan to add a new No. 3 dock with deeper draft and longer capacity, the original total length was 640 feet, and the first phase is now completed, 386 feet long, 80 feet wide at the entrance, and 27 feet deep. The dock wall is made of double-layered cast iron sheet piles, with ladders on both sides leading straight to the bottom of the dock, and a slope at the end of the dock,</p>
<p>Prepared for transporting and unloading heavy machinery. The dock gate is also made of steel, with water tanks inside to manage the lifting and lowering of the gate. There are two water pumps, each capable of pumping 31,700 gallons per minute, and two motors, each with 380 horsepower and 720 revolutions, and a voltage of 400 volts. The above-mentioned water pumps are installed next to the dock. The newly built house is equipped with bathtubs, etc., for the use of the crew of ships entering the dock. All the equipment is extremely perfect and is truly a major construction of our country in recent years. It is also named the Third Dockyard of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy. This dock has now been completed. The first phase of the project, totaling 386 feet, will hold a completion ceremony today, and the newly built Navy Yixian warship will be used by the Jiangnan Shipyard to enter the dock, in order to take the meaning of the first premier's training and construction. The project that should be expanded to the original planned 640 feet is still in progress. The Jiangnan Shipyard must clear the arsenal warehouse and the warehouse connected with the ordnance factory before starting construction. It is estimated that after the completion of the entire dock, the magnificence of the scale will not only be unmatched by the Shanghai Chinese and foreign shipyards, but also by the shipyards under the jurisdiction of China. Mr. Chen's plan this time is not only for the navy to build and repair large warships, but also for the various ship organs that should be needed in the country, such as the customs, China Merchants Bureau, salt affairs, water patrol police in various provinces,</p>
<p>And all the large industries, Chinese and foreign merchants, etc., are convenient. It is a relatively large construction in recent years. Today, the Navy Department sent Wu Zhennan, the director of the Coast Guard, to the dock to preside over the ceremony, and the wife of Zeng Yijing, the director of the Aircraft Division of the Jiangnan Shipyard, held the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Jiangnan Shipyard has already sent invitations to various agencies and Chinese and foreign shipping companies to attend the ceremony at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Aircraft Factory Completed Simultaneously <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, because the original factory buildings were too narrow and could not meet the needs of aircraft manufacturing, Zeng Yijing, the director of the plant, specially drafted an expansion plan, which was approved by the Navy Department,</p>
<p>An expansion fee of 40,000 yuan was allocated. The project was tendered to Shengzaoji Construction Factory in this city to build a new aircraft assembly factory building on the open space in front of the original factory building. Construction started in April this year. The combined factory is 96 feet 10 inches wide and 121 feet deep. The house is a two-story building with a height of 25 feet on both sides and a height of 43 feet in the middle. The entire factory building is divided into sections. The middle part is used for aircraft assembly, the upper floor is used as an office, and the original factory building,</p>
<p>Used as a paint wood factory and tarpaulin factory. The newly built aircraft assembly factory has now been officially completed. It is scheduled to hold a completion ceremony at 10:00 a.m. today with the third new dockyard. Chen Zaofan will execute the completion ceremony, and the factory will start working from that day.</p>

<p>A Total of Eight Men, Women, Old and Young Were Miserable. The seventh batch of eight men, women, old and young overseas Chinese expelled from Japan took the Japanese ship Rokkaku Maru at noon yesterday and arrived in Shanghai miserably. They landed at the Huishan Wharf. The representatives of the six batches sent people to the port at one o'clock to take care of them. Because it was too late, they did not meet.</p>
<p>The returning overseas Chinese compatriots looked haggard. Their miserable situation was very pitiful. At 12:15, because they had no money,</p>
<p>Each visited relatives and friends. In addition, the eighth batch of ten people is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Tsukuba Maru on the 14th, and the Asuka Maru on the 20th and the Kasagi Maru on the 21st will also have overseas Chinese compatriots who have been expelled from Japan to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Development of Commercial Aviation <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Dai Enji, the general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, yesterday presented a general overview of the development of commercial aviation in China in the past five years, saying that people from all countries have always considered our country's transportation industry to be extremely naive. The source of this concept is actually because our country's railways are not very developed, and everyone thinks that building railways is the most important issue in building our country's transportation industry. However, everyone knows that our country has relied on the benefits of Tianhe waterway transportation since ancient times. Improving this waterway will be of great benefit to preventing various water and drought disasters. Moreover, judging from the production of various provinces, most of the provinces can close their borders and be self-sufficient. Therefore, although there is a lack of railways, it is not so difficult. However, our country's territory is almost the same as the entire Europe. If we want to build railways throughout the country, the huge cost required may not be borne by the country for a while. What our country currently needs is not ordinary railways, but a more convenient and economical transportation tool than railways, which can increase the special speed for the transportation of mail and goods and the travel of passengers, in order to make up for the shortcomings of waterway transportation, and will not consume huge resources to increase the burden on the country and the people. There are two tools: highways and aviation. The effect of highway construction is actually twice the result with half the effort compared to railways. All goods transportation and ordinary travel across the country are convenient. As for aviation, its efficiency has been recognized by the world. If waterway, highway, and aviation transportation can be used at the same time, then our country's transportation problem can be completely solved. At the beginning of the establishment of the National Government, Sun Ke, the Minister of Railways, realized this, and signed a contract with the US Aviation Development Company to establish China National Aviation Corporation in order to promote air transportation. At that time, there were slight setbacks, but it was still able to work hard to achieve its success. This is the beginning of the development of our country's aviation industry. At the beginning of the establishment of China National Aviation Corporation,</p>
<p>There were many difficulties in the arrangement of everything. For example, the lease of various aircraft fields and their equipment, the investigation and research of climate changes in various places, and the training of radio telegraphers and clerks at each station, etc.</p>
<p>It is enough to cause setbacks. The day of the beginning of preparations was July 8th, the 18th year of the Republic of China. By October 20th, everything was ready. On this day, a Lockheed aircraft was used to make the first official flight between Shanghai and Hankou. The stations in the middle were Nanjing, Anqing, and Jiujiang. The distance was 516 miles. This is the general situation of the establishment of the aviation line in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. On April 1st, the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai-Hankou route was extended to Yichang. On October 11th of the same year, it was extended from Yichang to Chongqing. The entire route from Shanghai to Chongqing totaled more than 1,600 miles. The stations along the route are all commercial centers in the Yangtze River Basin. After the Hankou-Chongqing route was opened to traffic, preparations were immediately made for the Beiping route. This route officially started flying on January 10th, the 22nd year of the Republic of China, stopping along the way in Haizhou, Qingdao, and Tianjin. The success of this route is entirely due to the urging and economic assistance of Zhu Jia-hua, the Minister of Transportation, so that the company would not suffer a major economic loss when opening this route. On October 24th of the same year, the Shanghai-Guangdong route was also officially opened, passing through Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou. This route connects the three basins of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River, so that important cities across the country can communicate with each other. On November 11th of the same year, thanks to the efforts of Minister Zhu, the Chongqing-Chengdu route was established. By this time, Chengdu, the richest city in Sichuan, was also connected to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Equipment and flights: The aircraft used on the Shanghai-Chongqing route are Lockheed amphibious aircraft, which can carry one pilot, one co-pilot, and four passengers, with a speed of 90 miles per hour. There is one flight back and forth between Shanghai and Hankou every day, and three flights back and forth between Hankou and Chongqing every week. The aircraft flying on the Shanghai-Beiping and Chongqing-Chengdu routes are Stinson land-based aircraft, which can carry one pilot, one co-pilot, and four passengers, with a speed of 110 miles per hour. There are three flights back and forth between Shanghai and Beiping every week, and four flights back and forth between Chongqing and Chengdu every week. The Shanghai-Guangdong route will use Douglas Daerfang amphibious aircraft from October 15th of this year. This aircraft can carry one pilot and one co-pilot each, as well as eight passengers, with a speed of 150 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Pilots: The pilots hired by the company are strictly selected,</p>
<p>Have received special training, so they are rich in commercial aviation experience. This is not easily achieved by any country's airline. Currently, 12 pilots and 12 co-pilots have been hired, including 11 Americans, 1 German, and 11 Chinese.</p>
<p>Future expansion plan: Recently, the company's business development has seen rapid progress, which shows that air transportation is in urgent need in the society. In order to meet this need, a future plan has been formulated to develop our country's aviation industry. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hankou route: It is planned to replace the existing Lockheed aircraft with two Fairchild amphibious aircraft with 700 horsepower. The aircraft has a speed of 160 miles per hour and can carry two pilots and eight passengers.</p>
<p>It is also planned to change the flights from one flight back and forth every day to two flights back and forth every day.</p>
<p>Hankou-Chongqing route: It is also planned to replace the existing Lockheed aircraft with Fairchild aircraft, and it is planned to change from three flights back and forth every week to one flight back and forth every day.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Beiping route: The Stinson aircraft currently used on this route will also be</p>
<p>Replaced by a new type of Lockeheed variable engine aircraft. The speed per hour is 200 miles, and it can carry one pilot and ten passengers.</p>
<p>It is planned to change the number of flights from three times a week to one time a day. Chongqing-Kunming route: Yunnan's transportation relies solely on the Dian-Yue Railway. If you travel from Chongqing to Kunming, the only means of transportation is mostly carrying shoulders and walking on sheep intestines trails, crossing mountains and ridges. It takes 12 days to reach Guiyang, and another 12 days to reach Kunming. It is now planned to open a Chongqing-Kunming route in the shortest possible time. It takes one and a half hours to fly from Chongqing to Guiyang, and another one and a half hours,</p>
<p>That is, it reaches Kunming. Therefore, the arduous journey that takes 24 days can be completed in three hours.</p>
<p>Radio equipment: The company has radio stations at each station and backup airport. The Douglas Daerfang aircraft used on the Shanghai-Guangdong route last month, and the Lockeheed and Fairchild aircraft planned to be used on the Shanghai-Beiping and Shanghai-Chengdu routes are all equipped with radio equipment, which can communicate with land stations at any time during the flight.</p>
<p>The company suffered heavy losses at the beginning of its establishment. This situation is unavoidable for airlines in all countries. What is gratifying is that the company's business report on June 30th this year, apart from depreciation, has a slight surplus. This achievement is enough to break the records of famous airlines around the world, because the company has not received government subsidies, and this result is unique. The company's directors, in view of this excellent result, plan to purchase the latest equipment mentioned above with a huge amount of more than one million yuan, in order to achieve the purpose of expanding business and serving the people.</p>

Therefore, the Ministry of Railways came forward and formally consulted with China Construction Bank Company. Later, due to the treaty relationship between the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road and the British side, the loan amount increased to 16 million yuan. Therefore, it was decided that the China-British Bank</p>
<p>Company and China Construction Bank Company would jointly borrow. After months of long-term consultations, all items such as guarantee interest rates have been</p>

<h3 id="e123">Thorough Investigation of Tax Police Harassing the People <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Accusing Good People of Being Smugglers</p>
<p>Identifying Pickled Vegetables as Prohibited Items</p>
<p>Shanghai County citizen Qin Xitian and others specially jointly petitioned Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi regarding the tax police harassing the people. The text reads: A petition for the tax police to violate the law and harm the people. Please investigate thoroughly and severely punish them to stabilize the local area and rectify discipline. Shanghai County's second district borders Huangpu and does not produce salt. Residents all make a living by farming. On September 2nd of this year, a boat was robbed in the port. The owner followed the trace ashore and shouted for villagers to catch two thieves and send them to the county. The gang of thieves harbored resentment, so at midnight on the 4th, they gathered 30 to 40 people, each armed with guns, and robbed four families in a row. The villagers were terrified and guarded each other. In the evening of the 8th, there were also four people dressed in plain clothes and carrying cloth bags on their backs, wandering around looking suspicious. The villagers went to interrogate them, but those people took out the guns they were carrying on their backs and shot at people.</p>
<p>The villagers rose up to resist, injuring one person in the brawl and capturing three people, along with the guns, and sending them to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau. Later, the tax police captain filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court. The court immediately subpoenaed witnesses for investigation. On the morning of the 21st, dozens of armed men suddenly took a boat from Pudong to the district and raided in teams. A total of eight families were destroyed with doors, windows, and utensils, and robbed of gold and silver jewelry. Ten people were kidnapped. Several days later, four of them took the opportunity to escape back and claimed that they had been dragged off the boat by the police and taken to Dujiaxing Town in Nanhui County, where they were detained at the police headquarters. They were repeatedly subjected to private torture and beatings, forcing them to confess to salt smuggling, resulting in injuries all over their bodies. The whereabouts of the other six people are unknown. Therefore, the villagers were afraid of their return, abandoned their fields and houses, and fled one after another. On the 26th, when the court summoned them, Li Youlian, the head of the district, learned that the six kidnapped people had been sent to the court by the police. The court ordered Li District Head to find bail and release them. The case has not yet been closed. It is found that the Shanghai newspapers on December 23rd, 22nd year of the Republic of China, carried a Nanjing special telegram with a notice from Junbu that in the future, the tax police organs in each district, if the tax police detect that civilian households and shops are harboring smuggled salt, they must search, and they can first send police to guard outside,</p>
<p>At the same time, tax police wearing uniforms should cooperate with the local authorities to handle the matter in accordance with the law, and must not arbitrarily enter and search in order to maintain police discipline and avoid incidents. Those who violate this will be severely punished, etc. The Ministry of Finance's earnest intention to rectify discipline and maintain public order, but the tax police in each district often use the name of searching to intimidate and defraud the weak, plunder property, and even plant evidence to extort ransoms, accusing good people of being smugglers and identifying pickled vegetables and pickles as prohibited items. They act like tigers and foxes and run rampant everywhere. Our people are occasionally angered by them, and they are subjected to severe torture and heavy fines, causing them to be crippled, their families ruined, and their grievances unanswered. For example, in the case of the second district, because the villagers were repeatedly robbed, questioning pedestrians was still a legitimate defense. Why didn't the tax police report the incident, and immediately used their wild methods, which led to a fatal case. When the lawsuit was filed with the court, why didn't they wait for the court to handle it, and dared to openly rob, arrest civilians, use private torture, and illegally imprison them in broad daylight with armed ammunition,</p>
<p>Such trampling on civil rights, violating Jun orders, harming the political system, and not benefiting tax revenue,</p>
<p>If it is not thoroughly investigated and severely punished, how can the local area be stabilized and military discipline rectified? The commanders of the responsible district teams, who allow their subordinates to run rampant and do not prohibit them, are also difficult to excuse.</p>
<p>In order to dare to ask Junbu to select honest and just officials, go to the scene of the incident, conduct a thorough investigation, and give each a corresponding punishment, so that they can eliminate evil and appease the good in order to live up to Junbu's admonitions to the tax police. For the sake of public gratitude, I respectfully present to Minister of Finance Kong, The person who filed the report is Qin Xitian, a citizen of Shanghai County, Jiangsu Province (</p>
<p>74 years old, residing in the fifth district of Shanghai County, co-signed by Jin Qingzhang, Qiao Tang, Ding Jicheng, Kang Yongnian, Kong Xiangbai, Niu Changkang, Shi Qiguang, Gu Wenjun, Cai Yan, Ren Yongkang,</p>
<p>Not Joining the Guild</p>
<h3 id="e124">Still Liable for Membership Obligations <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Replied to the City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce previously stated that the failure of merchants in various industries to join the industry guild hindered the sound organization of the group, and had repeatedly requested the government to determine the sanctions for industries that do not join the industry guild. The situation was previously published in the newspaper. It is now learned that the association recently received a reply from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, saying, "Both reports are known. Regarding the case of industries not joining the guild, the Central People's Movement Committee and the Hubei Provincial Government have recently transferred the consultation, according to which the Hankou City Chamber of Commerce requested that clear methods be stipulated to force industries to join the guild uniformly, and that for merchants who do not join the association,</p>
<p>They should be held equally liable for all the obligations of members, etc. It should be based on Article 3, Paragraph 2, Article 4, Paragraph 1, and Article 7 of the Industry and Commerce Guild Law. The members of the industry guild are the companies and firms of all industries in the local area. All industries should naturally join the guild, fulfill the obligations of members, and abide by the rules of association. There is no freedom to withdraw or not join the association except for those who are suspended, relocated, or removed from the association. The so-called joining the association in Article 4, Paragraph 2, Item 5 of the same law refers to the regulations for joining the association. If a merchant is negligent in fulfilling the procedures for joining the association, it cannot be exempted from its obligations.</p>
<p>The association's proposal to hold merchants who do not join the association equally liable for all the obligations of members is in accordance with the laws and regulations. The most important obligation of members is to pay membership dues. For those who do not fulfill this obligation, the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan on May of last year, No. 914, can be applied and used for payment in accordance with the law, etc." I hereby reply to your knowledge, and it is necessary to inform you of this approval.</p>

<p>Europe's Light Industry Is Exceptionally Developed</p>
<p>To Save the Countryside, Production Should Be Promoted</p>
<p>According to the National Society, Qian Chengxu, PhD, the secretary-general of the Municipal Industrial Federation, attended the International Labor Conference on behalf of our country. After the conference closed, he stayed in Europe for a long time and traveled to various countries to inspect industry. His footprints covered the entire Europe. Now Mr. Qian has returned home. The reporter specially went to inquire yesterday and was told about the journey.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Foreign Impressions <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Qian stated that his recent trip to Europe to attend the International Labour Conference, after several years of absence, revealed a changed European landscape. Although Europe is affected by the economic downturn, with a sharp increase in unemployed workers, causing social and economic panic, Europeans are now</p>
<p>devoting themselves to the cause of production, hoping to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>Consequently, emerging light industries are exceptionally developed, with numerous inventions of light industrial machinery. These machines occupy less space and are cheaper, making them extremely common. He has compiled two books based on his observations: one is "An Economic Atlas of Europe,"</p>
<p>which uses diagrams to illustrate European economic relationships, and the other is "A Report on Industrial Investigation in Europe," which provides a very detailed account of European industry, totaling over a million words.</p>

<p>Mr. Qian further told the reporter that China has suffered from the global economic panic externally and frequent disasters internally in recent years, leading to the increasing bankruptcy of the rural economy. He believes that there is no alternative but to devote ourselves to production. He is now planning to gather like-minded people to establish a light industry manufacturing company, initially setting up a flour mill. This type of factory requires very little capital and yields significant benefits. If people across the country can emulate its establishment, it will greatly benefit the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>Inspecting the Status of Industry and Commerce in the Motherland</p>
<p>According to news from the Overseas Chinese community in this city, the industrial inspection group to return to the country organized by the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, originally planned to inspect the industrial and commercial conditions of Haikou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Hankou, Beijing, Shandong, Qingdao and other places in the motherland, in order to learn from them. However, due to its overly broad scope and excessive time required, most overseas Chinese merchants, being busy with business, could not make such a long trip. Therefore, the association reconvened a meeting,</p>
<p>and it was decided on the spot to first go to Haikou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Shang</p>
<p>hai, Nanjing, and other major ports to save time. The overseas Chinese departed last month on the first day, and after inspections in various places, they are scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong and other places in mid-month, and are expected to depart from Hong Kong to Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Presents to the Municipal Government</p>
<h3 id="e134">Request to Establish Pudong Waterworks <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Concerning the request for approval, on the 8th, according to the Pudong Branch Office, it was stated in a letter jointly signed by 60 merchants and residents, including Chengtai Company, of the Pudong Lan Ni Du Street area, that the drinking water of the Pudong citizens is usually turbid, and in the event of a fire, it often spreads due to the distance of the water source. Hygiene and fire prevention are inconvenient. In recent years, transportation has become convenient, and the population is dense. The tap water that the people rely on for their lives is urgently needed for construction. (Omitted) Therefore, we jointly request that the Municipal Government be requested to review and approve the matter, and that the Finance and Public Works Bureau be ordered to complete the Pudong Waterworks as soon as possible to benefit the people. It is for the sake of virtue," etc. The letter was forwarded to the Association. It was found that Pudong</p>
<p>has a dense population, and its position is comparable to that of Nanshi and Zhabei. However, the district's drinking water problem has not yet been fully addressed, which is an inevitable shortcoming of the city's municipal administration. According to previous reports, the tap water</p>
<p>plant can be established with an estimated investment of 300,000, which is not a very large amount. Compared with the construction of the city center, which requires large investments, the situation seems to be more or less difficult. According to the previous situation in the letter, it is appropriate to submit a document to your office for review and approval, and to order the Finance and Public Works Bureau to make arrangements for implementation as soon as possible, which would be in the public interest.</p>

The statement in the newspapers yesterday (8th) and today (9th) that the Navigation Administration Bureau convened representatives of the Drivers Association for mediation is not accurate.</p>

<p>Huzhou Area</p>
<h3 id="e140">Six County Groups Wire for Disaster Relief <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Huzhou Disaster Relief Committee, in view of the deep and widespread disaster in the homeland and the serious situation, is now working hard to provide relief and raise funds. It is heard that the association has recently received disaster reports and requests for disaster relief funds from the governments, county party headquarters, county chambers of commerce, and disaster relief associations of the six counties in Huzhou. Most of the people in the districts and villages initially mortgaged and borrowed goods to assist in the rescue. Then, the disaster has already formed, and the autumn harvest is hopeless, resulting in many houses being empty, and mournful cries everywhere. There are even those who do not have enough food and starve to death, and those who have built up debt and commit suicide out of despair. As for the looting of rice, it is even more common. In a blink of an eye, the severe winter is approaching, and millions of disaster victims have no food to eat or clothes to keep warm.</p>
<p>Mortgages are empty, and borrowing is impossible. If relief is not provided quickly, they will either die of starvation or freeze to death. Looking around at the disaster victims, one cannot help but feel sad. Moreover, the northeast of Huzhou borders Taihu Lake, and the southwest belongs to mountain villages. Bandits are lurking in all four townships,</p>
<p>always thinking about moving. The future of public security should be prevented in advance. Disaster relief and security are matters that cannot be delayed. It is hoped that people outside the Huzhou area have already realized this serious situation and will have the good intention of handling the aftermath well.</p>

<p>Leiyunshang Hosts Press</p>
<p>Will Invite Party, Government, and Industry Circles in Stages Tomorrow and the Day After</p>
<p>Leiyunshang Songfentang North Branch is scheduled to open for business on the 14th of this month. Mr. Lei Xianzhe, the owner and manager of the Hall, in order to connect with all walks of life, hosted a banquet at the Jinling Restaurant in West New Bridge at 6:00 last night to invite the press in this city. About 60 reporters from various major and minor newspapers in this city attended. Mr. Jiang Liusheng, Mao Zihou, and others greeted them separately. The atmosphere was lively and bustling. Halfway through the meal, Mr. Lei Xianzhe stood up to give a speech, saying that the Hall was founded in the first year of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, and has been more than 200 years old since then. The various medicines, pills, and powders produced on weekdays only seek material perfection, add more materials, and gain the trust of customers. They never make false discounts, cut corners, or deceive customers. Therefore, for more than 200 years since its creation, they have never held a major price reduction</p>
<p>to attract customers. Fortunately, they have been recognized by customers from all walks of life, and business has been quite satisfactory. Recently, in order to facilitate customers in the northern part of the city, a North Branch has been established, and departments such as sliced medicinal herbs and ginseng bird's nests have been opened to meet demand. Today, I am very honored that so many gentlemen from the press in this city have come, and I hope that they will give me advice from time to time to correct my shortcomings. Until about 9:00, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed. It is also heard that the Hall will host banquets for the party, government, and industry circles and staff in stages tomorrow and the day after.</p>
<p>Dispute over Burned Diamond Ring Pawn Ticket</p>
<p>Wang Pengzhou, a 50-year-old man from Yuyao, who sells foreign socks, lives in Yucang Street,</p>
<p>In the city, a man named Chen Qifa from Taizhou, about 34 years old, living at No. 90 Yuli, took a box of gauze silk stockings from Wang a week ago. At that time, he issued a banknote of ten yuan as a mortgage to Wang. Afterwards, Wang used the banknote, and the smoke exchange store said it was counterfeit and asked Wang where he got it from. Wang went to look for Chen Qifa, but Chen denied it. Wang was furious and lit a cigarette. He accidentally burned a cigarette case belonging to Chen. Chen immediately negotiated with Wang because there was a pawn ticket in the burned cigarette case, which was a diamond ring, which was also burned. He wanted Wang to compensate for the loss. Because of the dispute, police officer Wang Yaozong from the post arrived and detained both of them at the Laobeimen Police Station for investigation. According to Chief Shen's interrogation, Wang Pengzhou Chen Qifa used counterfeit banknotes and negotiated with him. According to Chen Qifa, Wang Pengzhou burned my cigarette case, which contained valuable pawn tickets, and wanted to shirk responsibility and deliberately falsely accused me of using counterfeit banknotes. As the case is related to the use of counterfeit banknotes and fraud, although the statements of both parties are contradictory, they will be handed over to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Another Theft Case in the Second District of the County <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Two Households Robbed in One Night, The Victim Suffered Injury</p>
<p>In the territory of the Second District of Shanghai County, theft cases have occurred frequently recently. Around 11:00 pm the night before last, more than a dozen bandits came to Sunjiazhai, Guantao Township in the district. They were all armed and broke into the homes of residents Sun Shuxiang and Sun Tusheng. The victims were awakened from their sleep. The bandits first tied up the men, women, old, and young and placed them in a corner, forbidding them to make a sound. Then they rummaged through the boxes and cabinets and searched wantonly. The silver dollars, clothes, and chickens and ducks robbed from the two families totaled hundreds of gold in losses. The search lasted about two hours before they let out a shout and fled south with their loot.</p>
<p>When the bandits were searching, Zhang, the mother of the victim Sun Tusheng, was beaten severely and suffered serious head injuries for shouting at the bandits. She is now groaning in bed, and her life is worrying. The victim has reported the incident to the Tangwan Public Security Sub-station for investigation, and it has been forwarded to the Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

<p>Zhu Hailiang, a 49-year-old man from Anhui, lived in a hut at Gaolang Bridge, Yangshupu Lan Road. Yesterday morning, at about 10:00, due to economic pressure and no way out, he had the idea of committing suicide. He then committed suicide by hanging himself in the room.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Yulin Road Police Station sent Chinese police officer No. 242 to the scene. The body was transported to the Tongren Hospital for examination at the autopsy room.</p>

<p>Should be Transferred to the District Court for Trial</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Tsz Wei Road Police Station discovered a red pill drug manufacturing operation on the 15th of last month at around 4 PM, inside a house at 59 Route Say Zoong, confiscating a large quantity of morphine, heroin, and other materials, as well as machine parts. They arrested three workers on the spot: Wang Asan from Wuxi, Zhang Asan from the local area, and Hang Xiqing from Ningbo. Hang attempted to escape by jumping out the window, injuring himself, and was sent to the hospital for treatment. The next morning, Wang and Zhang were sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. It was revealed that the operation was established by a Japanese man named Ikeda, and police detectives subsequently arrested a Japanese man named Gai Li and sent him to the Japanese Consulate for investigation.</p>
<p>Orders were given for the two defendants to be remanded in custody, pending Hang Xiqing's recovery from his injuries and further interrogation. Yesterday morning, Hang recovered and, along with Wang and Zhang, was sent to the Third Criminal Court.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that according to the Japanese side's testimony, two Chinese shareholders named Lu and Shen were at large. The police station filed a public prosecution under Article 6 of the Opium Suppression Law, requesting severe punishment according to the law. Judge Xiao briefly questioned the defendants and, due to the case being under incorrect jurisdiction, ordered the case to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for trial. Lawyer Li stated that during the appeal period, the defendants should remain in custody, which the court approved.</p>
<p>Extortion Case</p>
<h3 id="e146">Ji Zhongming Found Not Guilty <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Tang Naixiu, a Cantonese resident at 246 Route Lyonne, recently received multiple threatening letters from bandits, demanding 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Initially, a negotiation was arranged at the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession, but it was ignored. Then, another meeting was set near 451 Jiangxi Road, instructing to throw the money into a drain, where someone would retrieve it. Tang reported it to the Tsz Wei Road Police Station, who dispatched Detective Chief Fan De Fu,</p>
<p>Detective Liu Decheng, and others. On the 1st of this month, they prepared five-yuan and one-yuan notes of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, mixed with ghost money, and went to the designated location and threw the package into the drain. After waiting for a while, there was no sign of anyone taking it. The detectives found a hole connecting to the house at 455, and inside, they apprehended Ji Zhongming from Haimen, who was highly suspected. He used to work as a tea server at Tang's place and resigned for unknown reasons. He was arrested and taken to the police station. He claimed that the incident was his father's doing and was sent to the First Special District Court. His testimony was evasive, and he was remanded in custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Su Xiebin presided over a further hearing in the Third Criminal Court. When questioned about his confession at the police station, he stated that admitting it was his father who took the package and other statements were made under duress. He claimed he had no grievances against Tang, and his father was in his hometown and had not come to Shanghai, requesting the court's understanding. Judge Xiao Xiebin found the evidence insufficient and declared Ji Zhongming not guilty.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested remand in custody pending appeal, which the court granted.</p>

<p>Bo Xi, a young man from Hubei, 19 years old, was introduced by his uncle, Guo Naishan (54 years old, from Tianjin, currently residing at 8 Xideli, Route Paul Henry, in the French Concession, working as a customs broker), to learn the customs brokerage business at the Yu Yansheng Customs Brokerage at 6 Xiangxing Lane, 91 Route de la Grande Armée, a year and a half ago. Recently, his behavior changed; he became lazy at work,</p>
<p>and focused solely on gambling. Last Saturday and Sunday, he did not complete the unified tax certification form and gambled with the drivers at night. On Sunday, the manager, Zhou Wenqing (40 years old, from Ningbo), found out and reprimanded him. The young Liao, in a fit of anger, felt he had nowhere to vent his frustration and became despondent. That afternoon at 4 PM, he bought two large boxes of raw opium and, at 10 PM, returned to the brokerage, went to bed, and swallowed it, committing suicide. At 9 AM on the 8th, his colleagues noticed that he had not gotten up. They called him, but he did not respond. When they lifted the covers, they found Liao dead in bed. They immediately informed the manager and reported it to the police station. Detectives were sent to investigate, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy. The deceased's parents are still in his hometown of Wuchang. His uncle telegraphed them to inform them. Yesterday, the police station reported to the First Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor and recorder, to examine the body. They questioned the deceased's uncle, Guo Naishan, the manager, Zhou Wenqing, and witness He Yumin,</p>
<p>concluding that Liao Bo Xi had indeed died from swallowing raw opium. The body was released to Guo Naishan and others for burial. A small amount of opium was stored in the warehouse.</p>

<p>Lawyer Cai Xiaobai married Wu Xuegui, daughter of the fortune teller Wu Zhifen, known as "Little Confused," in the summer of last year. Wu Kaisheng and Xue Dubi were the marriage witnesses at the wedding held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao. After the wedding, they lived together on Route Massenet. After living together for a year, in the early summer of this year, they quarreled over minor issues and filed assault charges against each other at the French police station. The Second Special District Court summoned them, and after mediation, they reconciled. However, the reconciliation was short-lived, and the couple's relationship broke down again. Wu left Cai's residence. At this point, Cai believed that the</p>
<p>marital relationship was irreconcilable and petitioned the Second Special District Court, requesting a divorce through mediation. Because the defendant, Wu Xuegui, did not appear, the mediation failed. Details have been previously reported. Cai Xiaobai has formally filed a lawsuit,</p>
<p>requesting a summons and a divorce ruling. The Second Special District Court granted the request, and Judge Ma Yishu issued summonses, notifying both parties to appear at the Seventh Court at 10 AM on the 11th (tomorrow) for a hearing. It is unknown whether the defendant, Wu Xuegui, will appear in court at that time.</p>

<p>The Child Welfare Association has been established for six years,</p>
<p>striving for the well-being of children through methods such as protection, security, and relief, with education and relief complementing each other. Although it may not be perfect, it has a basic structure. Recently, the Association has further sought the development of child welfare work, so that the organization of child welfare groups across the country</p>
<p>can gradually become unified in an orderly manner. The key question is how to seek appropriate connections, how to develop concrete education plans, how to adapt to the psychology and physiology of children, and how to meet the needs of the social environment. Furthermore, in response to the national government's clear directive,</p>
<p>which designates 1935 as Children's Year, how should preparations be made to promote this great movement nationwide? All of these issues</p>

<p>Providing Small Loans to Regulate the Farmers' Economy</p>
<p>Cotton Production Cooperation and Transportation Have Been Quite Effective</p>
<p>In recent years, China's rural economy has been utterly ruined, and the lives of farmers have been arduous, urgently requiring relief. Banks in this city are investing in rural areas to regulate the rural</p>
<p>economy, in order to restore their original prosperity. Recently, JinCheng Bank has jointly established the North China Agricultural Improvement Association with the Ding County of Hebei Province and the Mass</p>
<p>Education Promotion Association, with the goal of developing cotton production in Ding County. Recently, they also plan to invest funds. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Cotton Production Transportation Quite Effective <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>This year, JinCheng Bank of this city, together with the Ding County of Hebei Province, the Mass Education Promotion Association, and the Economic Research Institute of Nankai University, jointly established a North China Agricultural Improvement Society. Its business operations involve transportation cooperation. According to the original cotton-producing area of Ding County, it can produce 300,000 dan of cotton annually, worth approximately 30 million yuan. Previously, the transportation cost per dan of cotton and the commissions earned by middlemen required about 7 to 9 yuan. Now, after the bank and the Livelihood Department of the Mass Education Promotion Association have cooperated in transportation, the transportation cost per dan of cotton is only 2.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Investing Two Hundred Thousand in Rural Loans <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>It is also reported that after the bank cooperated with the local Mass Education Society to carry out rural undertakings, remarkable results have been achieved.</p>
<p>There is very little risk in lending to rural areas, so it is planned to temporarily invest 200,000 yuan this year. If good results are obtained in the future, it is planned to increase the investment amount. As for the investment policy, it is said that it will focus on small loans, with most requiring reliable collateral. The various regulations that have been formulated are extremely strict, and progress has been quite smooth in recent days.</p>
<p>Hongkou Xiangyan Bridge</p>
<h3 id="e164">Trial of Homicide Case Opens <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Caused by Borrowing an Opium Pipe, Resulting in Tragedy</p>
<p>The Deceased Was an Only Child, His Father Has No One to Rely On</p>
<p>At the entrance of Juxing Lane, Xiangyan Bridge, Hongkou, at around 10 PM on the night of September 4th, a melee occurred, and a stray bullet struck the abdomen of Liu Jinfa, who worked at the Huasi Cloth Factory at No. 22 in the lane. He was immediately</p>
<p>sent to Tongren Hospital, where he died despite treatment. Afterward, the Linping Road Police Station arrested Sun Jieshou (also known as Sun Laosan), who fired the shot, and transferred him to the District Court, where he was interrogated and detained pending</p>
<p>investigation. The details were previously reported. As for the cause of this case, it is said that Xie Arong, a resident of the kitchen shed at No. 25 Juxing Lane, and</p>
<p>Ji Laosan, who lived in the nearby Xiangshan Lane, both privately operated opium dens, providing opium for people to smoke. Xie and Ji were also close friends. One day, Xie Arong's opium had run out, and his customers were impatiently waiting. Therefore, Xie went to Ji Laosan's house to borrow four opium pipes. Ji's wife instructed Xie to take five opium pipes from the opium jar himself. The next day, Xie only returned four pipes. Ji's wife immediately questioned Xie as to why he had returned one less pipe. Xie refused to accept this, which led to a conflict. Both sides invited many people to engage in a melee, resulting in a fatality. Now, the case has been preliminarily investigated by Prosecutor Kong Xianglin, who has filed a charge of homicide with the Criminal Court. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Judge Zhang Shao specially opened the Fifth Court for the trial, ordering the prisoner, Sun Jieshou (also known as Sun Laosan), to be brought to the case. He stated that he was 23 years old, a Shanghainese, residing at No. 1, Lane 77, Taiping Bridge Road, and working as a supervisor at the Mingsheng Smelting Factory. When asked, "Do you know Zhu Laosan?" he replied, "I don't recognize him." When asked,</p>
<p>"Why did you fight on the night of the 4th of last month?" he replied, "I don't know. At that time, I was still working at the factory and had not yet left work." When asked, "Did you shoot Liu Jinfa, causing his death?" he replied, "That is not true." When asked, "When were you arrested?" he replied, "I was arrested at home around 12 AM that night." When asked, "Before the deceased died, he said in the hospital that Sun Laosan definitely fired the shot and that he was a big man. Furthermore, the prosecutor from this court said that you fired the shot when he examined the injury in the hospital. Where is the handgun now?" he replied, "I am a businessman, how would I have a handgun?" The official ordered the witness, Zhu Laosan, to be brought to the case. He stated that he was 29 years old, from Xinghua, residing in Xiangshan Lane, Wuhua Road, and working as a laborer at an egg factory. On the 4th of last month, Xie Arong came to my house and called me outside, accusing me of reporting his privately operated opium den to the police,</p>
<p>saying that I was the one who reported it. Therefore, Xie, along with Sun Jieshou (also known as Sun Laosan) and three or four others, made trouble for me. Because I saw Sun Laosan holding a handgun, I was extremely frightened and fled, and then I heard a gunshot. When asked, "Have you known Sun Laosan for a long time?" he replied,</p>
<p>"I recognize him." Next, according to Zhang Liu, 36 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 22 Juxing Lane, Xiangyan Bridge, and working at the Huasi Cloth Factory, the deceased, Liu Jinfa, was an apprentice of my husband, Zhang Yulin. On the night of the shooting, I was not at home. It is said that Liu Jinfa and my six-year-old son were watching a small book under the electric light at the door when this tragedy occurred. When I returned home and learned of it, I telegraphed the deceased's father, Liu Liansheng, to come to Shanghai. When asked, "Do you recognize Sun Laosan?" she replied, "I don't recognize him." Finally, according to Liu Liansheng, 54 years old, from Xiaoshan, my son, Liu Jinfa, died tragically for no reason, but I only had one son, and I will have no one to rely on in the future.</p>
<p>I request justice. The judge said, "If you have a request, you should formally file a petition. There is still a need to investigate this case, so we will continue the hearing later." He was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Mother Returned Home Late at Night</p>
<h3 id="e165">Daughter Had Already Burned to Death <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Fire at Home, No One to Rescue the Girl</p>
<p>Regret After the Fact, How Could the Deceased Come Back to Life?</p>
<p>Chen Du, a woman from Nanhui, residing in the front building at No. 33, Yongshou Lane, 584 Route Joffre, in the French Concession, 33 years old, told her six-year-old daughter, Jin Di, to</p>
<p>go to bed first the night before last. She then took her young son out for a stroll, not returning until late at night. Unexpectedly, at 1:20 AM that night, the kerosene lamp placed on the table in front of the bed somehow fell over, causing the fire to spread to the mosquito net. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Neighbors discovered the fire and reported it to the police, and the fire brigade immediately drove a pumper to put out the fire, which was eventually extinguished. Fortunately, the fire did not break through the roof, only burning the bed, curtains, and miscellaneous items in the room. However, the girl, Jin Di, who was sleeping in bed, was not rescued in time and perished in the fire. When the fire brigade pulled out the body, it was charred,</p>
<p>her forehead and skull were gone, her abdomen was broken, and her intestines were exposed, a horrific sight. When the fire alarm sounded, Chen Du returned from her stroll. When she arrived at the entrance of the lane, she heard the alarm and mistakenly thought it was a robbery, so she did not dare to enter the lane. When the fire was extinguished and she entered the lane, she learned that there had been a fire at her home and that her daughter had already been burned to death. She ran to the door, wailing as she embraced the body.</p>
<p>Later, the police station sent detectives to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy. Yesterday, the Second Special District Court was notified, and Prosecutor Wang Ren went to the scene and confirmed that the deceased had been burned alive. After questioning the mother, he ordered the body to be released to the mother for burial.</p>
<p>Police in Datuan Township Are Brutal</p>
<h3 id="e166">Villager Tied Tightly to a Small Cart <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jincai Died Tragically from His Injuries</p>
<p>The Body Will Be Sent to Shanghai for Examination</p>
<p>Wang Jincai, a villager from Dongmachang in Datuan Township, Pudong, was a Taoist priest, nearly sixty years old, with an elderly mother, children, and grandchildren,</p>
<p>five generations under one roof, and a modest family fortune. On the morning of September 25th of this year, the police station accused Wang of selling morphine and sent police to arrest Wang and escort him to the Nanhui County Government. Unexpectedly, Wang suddenly died en route. Now, Wang's family claims that Wang Jincai was accused of being a morphine trafficker by the Nicheng Public Security Bureau, which dispatched several police officers,</p>
<p>who tied Wang with ropes. When Wang Puchai, who was a good citizen, was arrested for no reason, he argued with them, but this angered the police officers,</p>
<p>who struck him severely in the chest with the butt of a gun, causing serious injuries. He could not walk, so the police officers</p>
<p>used a small cart to lay Wang Jincai horizontally</p>
<p>and tie him tightly to the cart. When the carter, Yan Asan, pushed the cart slowly,</p>
<p>he was also beaten and scolded by the police officers,</p>
<p>who then pushed the cart themselves,</p>
<p>rushing wildly for less than half a li. Wang Jincai, after being injured and tied tightly to the cart, was subjected to severe shaking, and he died en route. This is truly a terrible injustice. They have requested a thorough investigation from the County Government. Now, the County Government's examination has confirmed that there are indeed injuries, but the police side claims that Wang Jincai died after being arrested due to poisoning himself. The two sides have conflicting accounts. Currently, the Nanhui County Government, in order to clarify the matter, plans to send Wang Jincai's body to the Zhenru Forensic Examination Institute for identification to determine whether he died from injuries or from poisoning, before making a final decision.</p>

<p>Zhang Yongsheng Sentenced to Seven Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Binghua Laoliu, formerly a prostitute, gave birth to a daughter while working as such. She later married an Englishman named Tana, who is currently a detective in the Public Concession police force. The girl was taken along and Tana treated her as his own, naming her Mengna Tana. She is now six years old. Recently, she was abused by Zhang Yongsheng and Zhu Asong, servants at their residence, causing injuries to her lower body. Binghua Laoliu then informed her husband Tana, who dismissed Zhang and reported the matter to the police, who arrested both men and brought them to the First Special District Local Court,</p>
<p>accusing them of raping a young girl. This was previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Judge Liu has thoroughly investigated the case. Yesterday morning, the two defendants, Zhang and Zhu, were brought before the court, and the verdicts were announced. Zhang Yongsheng was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for raping a girl under the age of sixteen. Zhu Asong was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for indecent behavior towards a girl under the age of sixteen. The number of days spent in custody will be deducted from their sentences at a rate of one day for every two days served.</p>
<p>After the verdicts were announced, the police took the two criminals back into custody to await confirmation before being sent to prison to serve their sentences.</p>
<p>China Economic Credit</p>
<h3 id="e168">Overview of the Cooperative Society Over the Past Year <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the social economy has gradually declined, and the economy of the general public has been particularly panicked. Mr. Zhang Shouyong and Mr. Qiu Hanping of this city, in order to promote cooperation and seek an economic way out for the common people, founded the China Economic Credit Cooperative Society last winter. To this day, it has been a year, and the achievements are quite remarkable. The general situation is as follows: (1) Organizational system: The highest authority of the society is the general meeting of shareholders, which elects the board of directors and the board of supervisors. The board of</p>
<p>directors appoints the general manager. Under the general manager, there are four departments: documentation, administration, accounting, and</p>
<p>cashier, and four divisions: savings, loans, mutual assistance, and investigation. There are also an investment review committee and an investment fund management committee. Zhang Shouyong is the chairman of the board, Qiu Hanping is the general manager, and the standing directors are Qiu Hanping, Zhang Yongnian, Xia Fengqi, Zhuang Zutong, and Chen Kan (Xia, Zhuang, and Chen also serve as directors of the savings, accounting, and documentation departments). Liu Daofang is the director of the mutual assistance division, Zheng Tianren is the director of the administrative department, and Lin Kanghou, Xie Xiaochu, Zhang Yuelian, Xi Yushu, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, and others are members of the fund management committee. There are about ten other staff members, all of whom have a deep understanding of their work. Among them, Zhang Shouyong and Qiu Hanping are the most responsible and hardworking. (2) Business situation: Cooperative movement is still in its infancy in China, and most people are indifferent to cooperative undertakings. Therefore, it is often not easy for general cooperative societies to develop. However, the society's methods are excellent and have won social sympathy. In the past year, the number of members has increased to more than a thousand, and the amount of social funds recognized each month varies, with some saving five yuan per month, and some saving ten or fifteen yuan per month. The society's savings are all managed by the management committee, which uses them properly and invests prudently.</p>
<p>A portion is also used for loans to members, which is convenient for them. It is estimated that at least several thousand yuan are loaned out each month. (3) Mutual assistance undertakings:</p>
<p>The society is very enthusiastic in handling mutual assistance affairs for its members. The most notable achievements are legal advice, medical advice, guidance for further education, free schooling, preferential shopping in stores, and lodging in hostels. (4) Entertainment facilities: The society has an entertainment room, a reading room, a conference room, and a billiard room, with a radio, various chess and ball games, and various books and newspapers. (5) The society has made great efforts to promote cooperation. Special supplements have been attached to major newspapers in this city for the opening ceremony and the solicitation of members. The Economic Cooperation Monthly, the Economic Cooperation Weekly, and the Society News have been published successively. The Economic Cooperation Weekly is distributed as a supplement to the Morning Post, and the Society News is edited and printed by the society itself and is still being published. (5) Society facilities: The society's offices are located in a three-story</p>
<p>Western-style building at the intersection of Hankou Road and Shilu Road, Tong'an Lane. The ground floor is the general office and dining room, the second floor is the entertainment room, reading room, conference room, billiard room, and manager's office, and the third floor is the hostel, dormitory, and bathroom. It is said that due to the development of the business, the current address is not sufficient for office use, and it will soon be moved to No. 918, Edward Road, which is opposite the Nanjing Grand Theater, and is larger in scale and</p>
<p>convenient for transportation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Agreed to Investigate and Handle</p>
<p>The residents of a section of Wuzhen Road, Zhabei North (between Xinmin Road and Xinjiang Road), all live in houses built with lead sheets, totaling about a hundred households.

<p>they were in a state of panic. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, they gathered more than a hundred residents, set out in a group, and went to the Municipal Government to petition.

<p>Mr. Hu Yongqi, General Manager of the Ningshao Life Insurance Company in this city, went to Hong Kong and Guangdong on the 25th of last month aboard the Hoover to inspect the financial situation and returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Hu,</p>
<p>the expansion of silver and the abnormal development of social finance have become the general state of our country. In Hong Kong and Guangdong, the interest rate of ordinary banks is only 3%, and there is an overabundance of cash, which cannot be invested. This is even more convincing. The industrial and commercial enterprises in Hong Kong and Guangdong are still thriving and have not been affected by the recession. Today, the company's colleagues will be at the Mainland Commercial Club of the Ningshao Life Insurance Company</p>
<p>for a wash of Mr. Hu, and there will be a report on the inspection of Hong Kong and Guangdong.</p>

<p>Three Editions of Hong Yanghao Knight Biography Premieres. Aidao Ya Road Rongji Dance Hall, since rehearsing the Hong Yanghao Knight Biography, because it praises revolutionary martyrs,</p>
<p>and imparts social education, and has absolutely no superstitious insertions, it was praised by the Municipal Education Bureau. The first two plays have been performed for a month each. The third edition has been rehearsed to perfection and will be performed starting on the evening of the Double Tenth Festival. The content is more exciting than before. Xiao Chaogui, the Western King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, dies in battle during the attack on Changsha in the play, played by Wang Huchen. The compiler paid special attention to national consciousness, so the excitement and tragedy are no less than Xiang Yu's suicide at Wujiang, in order to stimulate the audience and make them aware of the seriousness of today's foreign insults. In the scene where Xiao Chaogui's army leaves and Hong Xuanjiao bids farewell, the famous Kun corner Tong Yuejuan draws her sword and dances. Not only is the dance technique different from Farewell My Concubine, but it also firmly grasps the four characters of national revolution, and the consciousness is even faster than it. As for the scenery and costumes, the play has an outstanding reputation and is ingenious, even better than the first two editions. I will not say more about it for now. The dance hall decided to perform three editions of the Hong Yanghao Knight Biography starting on the evening of the Double Tenth Festival and the 11th. Art lovers should not miss it.</p>
<p>In addition, the daytime plays on the Double Tenth Festival are Wang Huchen's masterpiece Zhou Yu Returning to Heaven and Chang Liheng and guest star Ms. Tong Liying's Fourth Son Visiting His Mother, which are also major highlights.</p>

<p>By Zhang Ruoji</p>
<p>| At the China Vocational Education Society |</p>
<p>Introduction | Today, I am honored to be invited by the China Vocational Education Society to speak here, to gather with all of you and study together. It is a great pleasure. The rain is very heavy today, it hasn't stopped all day, and all of you have braved the rain to come here. This spirit is especially admirable to me.</p>
<p>The topic for today is divided into nine sections, but based on my previous experience of speaking at the Youth Association and various universities,</p>
<p>each time it always takes two or three hours. This topic is even more complex, and I'm afraid the time allotted today won't be enough to fully explore it. I hope that everyone will continue to study on their own.</p>
<p>1.  The Origin of the Topic: The reason I want to talk about this topic today is based on my consistent central idea. I dare not consider myself extraordinary, imitating Confucius by saying, "My Way is consistent." But I firmly believe that I do have a consistent idea. This consistent idea is nationalism. Every day, or rather, every moment, whether studying, writing, working, or returning home, I never forget our nation. I can say that I am a thorough and ardent believer in nationalism. Therefore, no matter what I speak about, what kind of knowledge I study, or what kind of problem I consider, my starting and ending points are always based on the nation. This is the initial reason why I want to talk about this topic. The method of learning should naturally be based on a scientific spirit and a calm, objective attitude. I myself study politics, especially public law.</p>
<p>However, when I study specialized knowledge, I always bring some emotion into it. Originally, a specialized scholar should have a scientific and rational mind, and should not mix in personal feelings. Emotional impulses are something that scholars should not have. But why do I deliberately violate this? There are many reasons, which cannot be explained in a single sentence. Simply put,</p>
<p>I advocate that emotion and reason should be developed in a balanced way. Therefore, no matter what kind of issue I discuss, I always carry strong and fervent emotions.</p>
<p>For example, when I study the constitution, I also bring the spirit and emotion of nationalism. Last year, I wrote an essay on the nation and the constitution in the Ta Kung Pao. My theory is probably not found in the constitutional law of any country in the world. This is also because it is influenced by my consistent ideas. Some people may laugh at me for studying in this way, saying, "You want to nationalize everything. What will your knowledge become?" In fact, the reason why we seek knowledge, and what we value about having knowledge, is simply to contribute it to our nation, to maintain and advance the long and great life of the nation. Without the interests of the nation, there is no value in knowledge. Without the foundation of national survival, we cannot create a system of knowledge. Therefore, I firmly believe in myself. Whether I am studying, working, speaking anywhere, or writing articles in my room, I should not deviate from this so-called foundation of national life. This is what all of us who study knowledge should encourage ourselves with. Today, while I explain the origin of the topic, I also sincerely advise everyone to enrich their knowledge and abilities based on this spirit, to promote the culture of our Chinese nation, and to save the nation from its current plight. Especially during this period of severe national crisis, the mission that we intellectuals bear should be especially significant.</p>
<p>2.  National Revival and the Relationship of "Power": A few days ago, a friend came from Beiping. He is a chief editor in a major newspaper in Beiping, and he is also a renowned professor at the six universities in Beiping. He was also a good classmate of mine in Europe. When talking to him about the issue of national revival, he said, "I feel that national revival is an issue of 'power.' Politics is also 'power.' How can we use this 'power' to promote politics and revive the nation? This is a major issue that we should pay attention to at present." I then followed up by asking him, "Then where is this 'power'?" This is the starting point for my creation of the "self-reliance" doctrine. Since the national crisis, domestic public opinion and popular sentiment have been very激昂, very慷慨, and very fervent. Among these many激昂慷慨 opinions and popular sentiments, we can certainly find many valuable opinions and theories that are worthy of our admiration. However, we cannot deny that some of them are empty and superficial. I think this is because the general public has been subjected to intuitive impulses without adding calm and rational consideration. I believe that reason and emotion should be balanced. Therefore, what we see and hear everywhere are theories and articles that are purely intuitive impulses. These kinds of theories and articles cannot actually save the nation. For example, generally people only advocate resisting Japan and saving the country in words, but in reality, they are not prepared at all. No one can say "no" to this kind of theory on the surface, but we must ask, where is the "power" to resist Japan? Is our national defense consolidated? Whether in terms of the people, the government, or various aspects, do we have the real strength to resist Japan? Despite慷慨激昂 speaking about resisting Japan, despite never forgetting to resist Japan psychologically, do we actually have the power to resist Japan? Do we have the means to resist Japan? They don't ask, don't research, and don't prepare. They are simply indulging in emotions, singing irresponsible high-sounding tunes that please people temporarily. Even more painful is that the purpose of a few people is only to激昂on the surface, to please the public, to seize the opportunity, and to show off their personal style.</p>
<p>There are too many opportunists in China today. There is speculation in being an official, and there is also speculation in doing patriotic movements. Seizing the opportunity of the national crisis, they say a few irresponsible words that please people temporarily, so that everyone will support them, and they use this power to gain a position and develop their own future and selfish desires. This kind of inconsistency between words and actions, opportunistic elements who deceive the public, cannot save the country. They can even be said to be criminals of the country. I remember that after the September 18th Incident, we had a meeting to discuss the issue of resisting Japan. I proposed twelve plans for resisting Japan, but they did not understand my proposal at all. I went back home in great sorrow and wrote an article with tears (titled "Vow to Save the Nation"), which was published in the Central Daily News and the China Times. This article</p>
<p>told the truth, without a single embellishment. Later, many newspapers and many places reprinted my article. Some friends even said that the value of my article was almost the same as Fichte's "Addresses to the German Nation." It can be seen that although my theory cannot be adopted immediately, it will eventually not be permanently buried. Therefore, since the national crisis, I have been determined to sing a "low-key tune." I am still singing a low-key tune now. Regardless of whether anyone agrees with me, I will not use this to steal a false reputation for myself, find a way out, or seek a position. It is not because others are singing high-key tunes that I especially want to sing a low-key tune to be different. I feel that the current decline of the Chinese nation, and the origin of the current severe national crisis, are definitely not the result of a single day. I can say that the decline of our nation and the current national crisis are caused by the "inertia" of the people's society over thousands of years. Our nation is dominated by deeply rooted social "inertia," and all social activities and the power of the people cannot be developed. Therefore, no matter which aspect of the country,</p>
<p>whether it is literary, military, economic, political, social,</p>
<p>or educational, all kinds of undertakings have not made significant progress.</p>
<p>Although China is a culturally advanced country, Chinese culture has been suppressed by this kind of "great inertia" for thousands of years and has not been able to develop.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the most advanced cultural country, it has now become the most落后 and without a country, or the country with the slowest cultural progress. Because of this reason, everything that follows culture, such as politics, economics, and military affairs, cannot be generated, and it becomes a nation without "power." Since the nation has no "power," it is naturally unavoidable to fail in the law of survival of the fittest. According to the principle of sociology, the direction of human development is originally towards the direction of the least resistance. Japan, seeing that China has no "power,"</p>
<p>it developed its militarism, its imperialism, and all its aggression from this direction. Therefore, the reason for the decline of our nation and the formation of the national crisis did not start with the September 18th Incident. The roots of the disaster have long been buried.</p>
<p>If we want to save the country today, the first thing we must do is to understand the reason for the decline of the nation, study how to enrich national power, and prepare to enrich national power in a down-to-earth and exemplary manner. Now that we know the reason for the decline of the nation, on the one hand, we must eliminate the "inertia" that hinders national development, and on the other hand, we must actively prepare for the development of "national power." With sound national power, there will naturally be the power to resist Japan and the power to revive the nation.</p>

<p>Notice of Suspension of Publication of "Reading Q&amp;A"</p>
<p>Time passes very quickly. "Reading Q&amp;A" has met with you for a full nine months. Except for the Lunar New Year and the occasional suspension of publication for no more than ten times due to insufficient space in this newspaper,</p>
<p>tens of thousands of readers have been reading it every day. We are very honored that we have gained so many sympathizers in spirit, but on the other hand, we cannot help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>What have we given to the readers after all? On this eve of suspension of publication, we have reflected on it earnestly. Before parting, we cannot help but make a self-confession. We cannot help but admit that what we have given to others, if not zero, is too limited.</p>
<p>This is by no means a humble statement. First, because "Reading Q&amp;A" is only a part of the work of this department, and this department itself is only a department of the library, we do not have more sufficient time to make "Reading Q&amp;A" more vibrant and more practical. Second, because of the space limitations of this newspaper, news articles are often crowded, and for a poor "Reading Q&amp;A" article, it often has to be cut into several paragraphs, so that readers are not connected before and after,</p>
<p>and reading it is the same as not reading it. Third, because the people who write Reading Q&amp;A,</p>
<p>are mostly a few bookworms, too far removed from the actual lives of shop assistants and apprentices, and what they write inevitably still carries the atmosphere of scholars, and cannot make people who really have no education approach it. Fourth, we are also subject to many well-intentioned criticisms and strict corrections from various aspects. We勉强尽棉力 and want to be detached, but we are really exhausted and cannot live up to everyone's expectations. In short, looking back on ourselves, besides shame, there is only self-blame. Now we don't want to continue doing this work that we can't do. We respectfully thank and apologize to everyone who cares about us.</p>
<p>What about in the future? We are library workers, and our work of reading guidance in the library will not stop because of this. On the contrary, we will concentrate our efforts on other aspects. At the same time, we can add a note to comfort readers that the Reading Life Society will soon publish a reading magazine called Reading Life Bi-monthly. In the future, any questions about reading, or that publication may also talk about it. Now that we have temporarily canceled this corner of the newspaper, we probably won't feel too lonely.</p>
<p>Before and after, we sincerely hope that readers will always take new knowledge in life. Today's China must be in a very rich era. As long as you are loyal to life and diligent in taking,</p>
<p>there is really nowhere that you cannot gain knowledge. We advise you to study hard, but at the same time, don't believe in books too much. We advise you to spend one minute reading in the streets and markets, and don't go back to the book room with bright windows and clean desks. And wish you all take care.</p>
<p>Special announcement from the Reading Guidance Department ·· Although the Reading Q&amp;A edited by this department has been announced to be suspended, we have not stopped guiding the readers of this library or this newspaper in reading because of this. If readers have any doubts about books, they can still ask them as much as possible and discuss them with us.</p>
<p>We will do our best to answer them in individual replies. In the future, readers' letters should still be sent to the Reading Guidance Department, Circulation Library, Shen Bao, 3rd Floor, Continental Shopping Center, Nanjing Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Special Issue of the Children's Library</p>
<h3 id="e188">Talking about Children's Library from the Standpoint of Education <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Renjian</p>
<p>People, especially when they are young children, as long as parents or society have the ability to bear it, there is no one who does not want to give him a good education.</p>
<p>But why should one receive education, what kind of education should one receive, and is there a relatively simple way to receive a good education.</p>
<p>We don't need to talk about profound academic theories. Simply put, education is nothing more than to be a person, that is, to let young children know people's things and affairs, understand people's words and thoughts, and perceive people's joys, anger, sorrows, and happiness, so that he can get along with people and cooperate with people, and then he can join people's society, and people will not abandon him outside society. In other words: The root of education lies in making young children "humanized".</p>
<p>Of course, young children from birth, are immersed in people's experiences: what he sees are nothing but people's things and affairs, what he hears are nothing but people's words and thoughts, what he feels are nothing but people's joys, anger, sorrows, and happiness. However, what he sees may not be very clear for a while, what he hears may not be very clear for a while, and what he feels may not be very touching for a while. He often looks like this, looks like that, and looks like something else; asks this, asks that, and asks something else: What is this? What is this used for? Where does this come from? Is this always like this? How is it done? Who did it? Can I do it··· Educators should answer these questions for him, and education is in these questions and answers! If we can answer him, answer him fully, and answer him interestingly, he will look again, ask again, and feel and observe again, from one point to another, from one step to another, until he can answer himself and progress himself.</p>
<p>We know that contemporary society is no longer as simple as it used to be. It is easy to see, hear, and feel. Even ordinary adults there can recognize and perceive social affairs and objects there even if they recognize and perceive, they there can know how to show it to young children, explain it so that young children can understand it, and stimulate it so that young children feel it even parents who are very close to young children, even kindergartens and low-grade elementary school teachers who have teaching experience also seem to be difficult to guarantee that they will be effective. Therefore, whether in the family or in the school, whether it is parents, teachers, or young children themselves, they all need a kind of excellent guidance, learning tools, and a medium for humanization. From the standpoint of education, the reporter believes that this is the real contribution of the "Children's Library" published by the Commercial Press. We have specially made the following "Chart of Children's Development and Children's Library" to express this meaning and wish this "Children's Library" success and the continued efforts of those who edit and publish this new library.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Dissection of the Children's Library <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yingchang</p>
<p>I remember that during Children's Day this year, I wrote an article entitled "From Children's Day to the Children's Books of the Commercial Press." The main content was about giving good children's books to children on Children's Day and giving a brief introduction to the various types of books contained in the Elementary School Students' Library. Finally, I mentioned that the books in the Elementary School Students' Library were suitable for the upper grades of elementary school, and I hoped that the Commercial Press would publish a complete set of readings for the lower grades of elementary school in the near future.</p>
<p>Indeed, lower elementary school students also want to enjoy interesting readings and have a desire for knowledge. If we are prejudiced against lower elementary school students and do not provide them with books of a comparable level, we would not only be unfair to general lower elementary school students but also go against the principles of education. This matter should not be ignored. Moreover, the "Teaching Points for Elementary School Chinese Language Curriculum" formulated by the Ministry of Education also mentioned, "In addition to intensive reading each week, there should be regular guidance for extensive reading" and "Besides in-class guidance, children should be urged to read extensively outside of class..." In order to fulfill the mission of providing extracurricular reading materials for lower elementary school students, the Commercial Press actively carried out the editing and printing of this Children's Library after the completion of the Elementary School Students' Library to meet the needs of lower elementary school students.</p>
<p>The Children's Library went through careful planning and was successfully completed with the cooperation of more than thirty colleagues with rich teaching and writing experience. It will soon be able to meet with children all over the country. In order to make people all over the country understand the content of the Children's Library, we specially dissected its content, hoping for corrections from domestic children's education experts, elementary school teachers, and parents.</p>
<p>(1) The Selection of Materials for This Library</p>
<p>Whether editing and printing a single book or a series of children's books, if the selection of materials is solely aimed at catering to children's low-level interests, such books are not only useless but also harmful to children. The selection of materials for this library has been repeatedly deliberated and detailed editing regulations have been formulated. The content of each book is entirely centered on the revitalization of the nation, such as promoting labor production, instructing on resisting foreign aggression and saving the country, cultivating civic morality, and enlightening scientific knowledge. All of these aspects have been taken into consideration. Materials containing selfishness, profiteering, contention, passivity, timidity, pessimism, restraint, and feudal ideas are all avoided. In addition, attention is paid to materials about children's activities: there are things to sing, things to play, and things to do. All activities that children love are collected as much as possible. The entire book consists mostly of original material.</p>
<p>(2) The Level of This Library</p>
<p>This library is edited according to the level of lower elementary school students, with books as the mainstay, supplemented by short textual explanations. Elementary school students who have read half or one volume of Chinese textbooks can read on their own with only slight guidance from teachers or parents.</p>
<p>(3) The Categories of This Library</p>
<p>This library refers to the subjects in the curriculum standards for lower elementary schools and divides the content into twelve categories: society, civics, nature, arithmetic, hygiene, physical education, labor, art, poetry, language, riddles, and stories. Everything that lower elementary school students should have is included. Now, we analyze the proportion of each category of materials in the first collection of 200 books in this library as follows:</p>
<p>Category Number of Books % Category Number of Books %</p>
<p>Society 29 14.5 Civics 16 8.0</p>
<p>Nature 41 20.5 Arithmetic 4 2.0</p>
<p>Hygiene 11 5.5 Physical Education 3 1.5</p>
<p>Labor 8 4.0 Art 5 2.5</p>
<p>Poetry 7 3.5 Language 4 2.0</p>
<p>Riddles 4 2.0 Stories 78 39.0</p>
<p>Total 200 100.0</p>
<p>If we summarize the twelve categories of materials, they can be divided into two major categories: (A) those related to knowledge and skills, such as society, civics, nature, arithmetic, hygiene, physical education, labor, language, and riddles; (B) those related to appreciation, such as arithmetic, poetry, and stories.</p>
<p>Let's statistically analyze these two major categories of materials. Those belonging to knowledge and skills total 110 books, and those belonging to appreciation total 90 books. Comparing the two, the difference is negligible. Based on this ratio, we can know that the content of this library is balanced in both quality and quantity, without the drawback of favoring any one type of material.</p>
<p>(4) The Distribution of This Library</p>
<p>Due to the limitation of the number of books in the first collection of this library (200 books), each category cannot, of course, completely include all the necessary materials. However, after careful planning, we have accommodated the most important materials in each category as much as possible. Now, we will take the books included in the society category of this library as an example to briefly illustrate our plan for distributing each category.</p>
<p>There are 29 books in the society category of this library. The titles are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Lovable China 2. Shapes of Maps of Various Provinces</p>
<p>3. My Home 4. My Hometown</p>
<p>5. Our School 6. Our Library</p>
<p>7. Life of Ancient People 8. Tree Dwellers</p>
<p>9. Cave Dwellers 10. Clothing</p>
<p>11. Food 12. Shelter</p>
<p>12. Transportation 14. Street Sweeping</p>
<p>13. Firefighting 16. National Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>14. Hot Places 18. Cold Places</p>
<p>15. National Flags of Various Countries 20. Children of Various Countries</p>
<p>16. Sun Yat-sen 22. Yellow Flower Hill</p>
<p>17. Double Tenth Festival 24. Children's Day</p>
<p>18. Several Great People (Part 1) 26. Several Great People (Part 2)</p>
<p>19. Our Navy 28. Our Army</p>
<p>20. Our Air Force</p>
<p>The purpose of the above books, such as "Lovable China" and "Shapes of Maps of Various Provinces," is to arouse children's national consciousness. "My Home" and "My Hometown" can allow children to understand their own hometown. "Our School" and "Our Library" can enable children to understand the organization and environment of the school. "Life of Ancient People," "Tree Dwellers," "Clothing," "Food," "Shelter," and "Transportation" can enable children to understand the evolution of human life. Street sweeping and firefighting are materials related to social undertakings. The purpose of the National Goods Exhibition is to cultivate children's habit of using domestic goods. "Hot Places" and "Cold Places" are knowledge related to geography. "National Flags of Various Countries" and "Children of Various Countries" are materials related to international affairs. "Sun Yat-sen," Yellow Flower Hill, and the Double Tenth Festival aim to make children understand the contributions of the Premier and other martyrs to the founding of the Republic of China and to know the loveliness of National Day. Children's Day is closely related to children and can enable children to know to respect their own position. The representative figures in "Several Great People" are related to culture, some are patriotic heroes, some are scientists, and some are explorers, all of which can serve as models for children. "Our Navy," "Our Army," and "Our Air Force" can enable children to have some understanding of national defense equipment.</p>
<p>Looking at the content of the above books as a whole, we can get a glimpse of the appropriateness of the distribution of materials in this library and the closeness of the connections. The distribution of materials in other categories such as civics, nature, and arithmetic also has its own characteristics. Due to space limitations, it is not possible to list them all.</p>
<p>(5) The Style of This Library</p>
<p>Except for labor, art, poetry, and riddles, which are special in nature, each book in other categories in this library forms its own unit. The style of each book varies depending on the nature of the material. There are rhymed texts and prose. Rhymed texts are not limited to the poetry category; society, civics, nature, hygiene, physical education, riddles, etc., are also written in rhymed texts. Because rhymed texts have syllables, they can be recited, are easy to remember, and have a relatively strong interest in reading. Therefore, the materials in this library that can be compiled in rhymed texts are compiled in rhymed texts to increase children's reading efficiency.</p>
<p>(6) The Words and Sentences in This Library</p>
<p>The words used in each book of this library are extremely careful. First, they are based on the research results of various experts as a blueprint for the words used, and then a vocabulary of commonly used words is formulated with reference to the current textbooks for the lower grades of each subject. Then, the words used in each book of this library are determined based on the vocabulary. Regarding the organization of sentences, we strive to be concise. Each page has a maximum of no more than eight sentences, and each sentence has a maximum of no more than nine characters (some books, such as "My Toys" and "Zoo," require detailed explanations, so the sentences have to be slightly longer than the original standard, but this number does not exceed seven percent). The wording is completely suited to children's tone, so that young children can read easily and efficiency is increased.</p>
<p>Because this library has to comply with the curriculum standards, starting from the third grade of elementary school, there is a provision for "familiarity with the National Phonetic Alphabet," so the books in this library do not uniformly add phonetic symbols in order to be dedicated to use by lower-grade students.</p>
<p>The font of children's reading materials should be large, so that they can be clearly seen at a glance when reading, and it will not hurt eyesight. The font of this library is all regular script, the largest is equivalent to ordinary first-size lead characters, and the second largest is equivalent to ordinary second-size lead characters. The font is elegant and the strokes are clear, which can be used as a model for children's writing.</p>
<p>(7) The Illustrations in This Library</p>
<p>Children like to appreciate illustrations more enthusiastically than they appreciate text. Each book in this library has beautiful and lively illustrations, which on the one hand can give children a deep impression of the content of the book, and on the other hand can arouse children's interest in beauty, so that considerable educational benefits can be achieved in the illustrations.</p>
<p>Among the 200 books in the first collection of this library, 50 books are printed in five colors, 50 books are printed in two colors, and 100 books are printed in single-color ink. All things that need to express their authenticity are printed in five colors to give children an accurate understanding of certain things. For example, the books "Zoo," "Birds," "Butterflies and Moths," and "Our Fruits" are all examples of books printed in full color.</p>
<p>(8) The Paper in This Library</p>
<p>The paper for children's reading materials must be thicker than ordinary paper so that it is not easily damaged. The paper used in this library is 140-pound thick Swiss paper, which is strong and durable, so that each book can be preserved for a long time. The paper is not only white but also does not reflect light, which does not hurt eyesight. This is also a feature of this library.</p>
<p>(9) The Format of This Library</p>
<p>The format of children's reading materials should not be too large or too small. If the format is too large, it will not only take up a lot of space when stored, but it will also be inconvenient to carry. If the format is too small, the font and illustrations will have to be reduced, which will hinder children's learning psychology. The format of this library is 7.5 inches in height and 4 inches in width, the same size as the textbooks and children's books and newspapers published by this library, which is very convenient for storage and carrying.</p>
<p>(10) The Application of This Library</p>
<p>Because this library is rich in content, well-organized, has many illustrations, and the text is easy to understand, its scope of application is relatively wide. In addition to being specially provided for families to organize libraries, for children to read at home, and for school libraries to set up separate lower-grade reading rooms for lower-grade students to read at school, it can also be provided for adult libraries to set up separate children's reading sections for nearby children to read at the library; it can also be used as supplementary books for older illiterate people in various local mass education halls, farmer education halls, and public reading rooms.</p>
<p>The content and form of this library have been briefly dissected as above. As for the effects of the application of this library in various aspects after its publication, I will report on it when there is an opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Introduction to the Children's Library <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Zhizhan</p>
<p>I remember that on last year's National Day, I published an article introducing the Elementary School Students' Library. It has been a full year since then. In the past year, it is said that more than 10,000 copies of the Elementary School Students' Library have been ordered across the country. According to a rough estimate, there should be about one million elementary school students reading it. The benefits gained by elementary school students from reading it must be great.</p>
<p>The content of the Elementary School Students' Library is suitable for upper elementary school students. If lower elementary school students are to be provided with reading materials, another library that is more simple and easy to understand must be compiled. In order to meet this need, the Commercial Press engaged in the editing of the Children's Library after the completion of the Elementary School Students' Library. Now the manuscripts have been collected and sent to print and are scheduled to be published. I think this work is very valuable, and its value can be said to be the same as that of the Elementary School Students' Library.</p>
<p>Compiling and printing a library that is truly suitable for children to read is indeed not an easy task. I think that at least the following points must be taken into account when compiling and printing such a library.</p>
<p>First, the entire library must have an overall plan and organization. Within the possible range, each book must also become a complete unit.</p>
<p>Second, all materials must be suitable for children's lives. Children can gradually develop their experience by reading them.</p>
<p>Third, the vocabulary used in each book must be easy for children to recognize and understand, and the sentence structure must also be suitable for children's tone.</p>
<p>Fourth, children like to appreciate illustrations very much. All illustrations must be vivid, lively, and full of interest.</p>
<p>Fifth, printing and binding must not only be beautiful but also strong and durable. Because beauty can easily arouse children's interest in reading, and strong binding can preserve it for a long time.</p>
<p>When we introduce the Children's Library, we cannot ignore the above five points, of course.</p>
<p>The first collection of the Children's Library has a total of 200 books, divided into twelve categories such as society, civics, nature, arithmetic, hygiene, physical education, labor, art, poetry, language, riddles, and stories, which include the knowledge, skills, and various activities that children should have. According to the editors, each category of materials has considerable connections, and each book is also as much as possible a self-contained unit. After reading, children will not only enrich their lives but also develop the ability to cope with the current society. The vocabulary used in the entire library is all based on evidence, and the sentence structure also takes children's tone into account as much as possible. All the illustrations have very lively lines and even more beautiful colors. The paper used is strong and thick and does not reflect light, so children can read without hurting their eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, in fact, the Children's Library can take care of the above five points. In our country, where children's reading materials are scarce, the great effect of providing this Children's Library for children across the country to read is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>If elementary schools across the country lack supplementary reading materials for lower grades, if families are willing to seek educational happiness for their children, and if libraries want to establish children's sections, I think this Children's Library will definitely provide great help.</p>

<p>Football Friendly Match</p>

<p>9:30 AM at Shenyuan</p>
<p>The Lafayette football team has been reorganized this session, and the team's affairs are becoming more and more prosperous. Since the start of the competition, it has responded to the invitation letters from various strong teams in Sudi and has held its maiden game. It has won many victories in matches against strong teams such as Soochow University football team and Suzhou United team in Sudi. Today is the Double Tenth Festival commemorative day, and at 9:30 AM,</p>
<p>At Shenyuan Stadium, Lafayette will play a friendly match against the Xishang A team. The Xishang A team performed very well in the A team competition of the Xilianhui last session, and the team has always been known as one of the strong teams in the Shanghai football circle. Since its reorganization, the Lafayette team has a number of new talents, many of whom are veterans of the battlefield. This time, the Lafayette team will play against the Xishang A team. It is predicted that the Lafayette team will have more misfortune than good fortune, but when the time comes, the two teams will meet, and a wonderful performance will be given, no matter who wins or loses. It is hoped that the Lafayette team members will be present at the second floor of the YMCA at Baxianqiao at 9:00 AM on the morning of that day for the timely departure. Judge Shen Huichun,</p>

<p>Track and field performance in addition to ball games</p>
<p>The East Asia Physical Education School of Lujiagou in this city trains its students with extreme strictness. Especially focusing on closed-door hard training in athletic skills.

The guarantee deposits for these badges have already been paid to the association by each school and will be returned (the schools should bring the association's general receipt to the meeting to collect them). 5. Regarding the collection of educational film fees, there are occasionally a few schools that refuse to pay, and how to handle this. It was resolved that the Education Bureau will dispatch personnel to assist members of this association in collecting fees from the schools. 6. A report stated that the International Alliance had sent a letter to the general association, requesting that schools at all levels in our country be consulted to organize educational film pioneer teams to make full use of films and increase educational efficiency. The Department of Education has instructed each provincial and municipal education bureau to investigate and handle this matter.

<p>The Patriotic Girls' Middle School held a memorial week at 11 a.m. the day before yesterday. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, was invited to give instructions. Mr. Pan arrived at the school,</p>
<p>and after being introduced by the principal, Ji Yisheng, he delivered a speech to the students entitled "A Patriotic Plan," the main points of which were: "The method of patriotism requires the preparation of three kinds of power: (1) self-reliance, (2) self-defense, and (3) organizational power. The emergence of self-reliance lies in the development of intelligence and ability, and its purpose is to seek self-production and not rely on others. The emergence of self-defense lies in the tempering of physical strength, and its purpose is to resist insults and defend against enemies to ensure survival.</p>
<p>The emergence of organizational power lies in the possession of morality, and its purpose is to gather individuals to form a nation, so that the ability of self-reliance and self-defense can achieve the greatest effect. In the past, people divided morality into public morality and private morality, which is a great mistake. Morality cannot be established without society. In other words, the cultivation of self-reliance is intellectual education, the cultivation of self-defense is physical education, and the cultivation of organizational power is moral education. The production of these three components all belongs to self-confidence. If young students can be confident that they have self-reliance, self-defense, and organizational power, then the desire for patriotism can be fulfilled." Mr. Pan was energetic, and his speech lasted for more than an hour without fatigue, repeatedly citing analogies, and his attitude was extremely sincere. The three or four hundred people in the audience were all solemnly moved, as if they had received timely rain and transformation.</p>

<p>The Price of British Silver Rises to 23 Pence</p>
<p>Premium Falls Again by $3.90</p>
<p>The gold market continued to fall yesterday due to the creation of a high price for British silver in recent years.</p>
<p>However, the situation was strong at first and then weak, and the market conditions for the day were quite uncertain. The November term still followed the old standard for transfer, but because there were rumors that the bulls were knocking out large spreads, the difference between the two months rose to the $2 mark. As for the future forecast, if we look at the big picture, then the bulls in November seem to be less stable than in December. If we look at the settlement price, then with a difference of $2, the buyer seems to be at a disadvantage. The number of November contracts has decreased to 23,100. The market conditions for the day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was $919.60, down $4.60 from the previous close.

According to the closing price, the premium was about $46 weaker, which was slightly more than the previous close. The new standard settlement price for December was about $956 based on the central bank's premium standard price, and the premium was about $46 according to the closing price, which was $5 more than the previous close.

<p>and the selling price was $13.50. (Futures) The central bank still slightly opened spot premiums,</p>
<p>and the price was more expensive than the futures premium. After the gold market fell, public orders seemed to have not been resolved. Only 21 contracts remained for the next month.</p>

<p>Exchange Rate Drops Again and Silver Price Soars</p>
<h3 id="e219">British and American Exchange Rates Continue to Harden <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, the London big bar rose 25 in both the near and far terms, and the American silver actually rose 375. London raw gold rose 3 pence, the British-to-American rate shrunk by 625, the American-to-British rate fell by 1.5 points, and the British-to-French rate fell by 19 pounds. The exchange market opened in the morning with the selling price of the near-term British exchange rate at 1 shilling 5.75 pence and the US exchange rate at $36.3125, which was 125 looser for the British and 125 harder for the American compared to the previous close. The opening was strong, and the British exchange rate showed a loosening trend while the American exchange rate showed a tightening trend, which was due to the weak situation downstream and the limited rumor of stopping the US dollar from falling. The market was flat in the morning, and banks still had a selling appetite. When it was learned in advance that HSBC Bank's listing for the British and American exchange rates had only risen by 125, there was great disappointment, and the process tightened. Merchants continued to have an appetite, but there was a lot of hovering. When the banks had reciprocal transactions, the market became tense again, but the market atmosphere was sluggish. Finally, Chinese merchants came to stuff, and the noon moment was still hard. In the afternoon, there was news that the central government had opened spot transactions, and the sentiment was still flat, and the banks also had a accepting appetite, which slightly tightened the market. The Bombay telegrams were not moving and small, and the situation was very good, but Chinese merchants still had a selling appetite. The second Bombay telegrams were not moving, and the market situation was stable. At the close, the actual price of the near-term British exchange rate was 1 shilling 5.75 pence, and the US exchange rate was $36.3125, which was 125 looser for the British and 1875 weaker for the American compared to the previous close.

<p>The silver dollar market has been weak recently. Due to the sluggish market demand and the reluctance to lend money, the market atmosphere has become increasingly sluggish. The market interest rate has been declining in an orderly manner every day, which is like a river flowing downwards. The early market was 6 points, and the noon market fell to 4 points. Such a continuous decline will inevitably lead to no interest at all. The stagnation is extremely high. In the transaction of interest-bearing notes, the total turnover and new transactions in the early market were more than 3.3 million, and the turnover in the afternoon market was more than 200,000. In the Small General Association, the transaction volume was more than 400,000. In the transaction of foreign mortgage loans, more than 700,000 were redeemed and more than 900,000 were newly made. In the bank settlement, foreign banks settled more than 2.2 million for ticket payments, more than 2.9 million for various goods, exchange mortgage miscellaneous payments, more than 700,000 for telegraphic transfers, more than 900,000 for foreign exchange settlements, more than 500,000 for special exchange payments, and 400,000 were shipped out. Chinese banks settled more than 2.6 million for ticket payments, more than 3.5 million for various goods, exchange mortgage miscellaneous payments, more than 400,000 for telegraphic transfers, more than 1.2 million for foreign exchange settlements, more than 800,000 for special exchange payments, 600,000 for customs duties, and 300,000 were shipped out. Japanese banks settled more than 1.7 million for ticket payments, more than 4.1 million for various goods, exchange mortgage miscellaneous payments, more than 900,000 for foreign exchange settlements, and 500,000 were shipped in.

<p>The source of funds from outside was 200,000, and the outflow was 250,000. In addition, the total amount exchanged in the bill exchange office in this city was 8,692,847 silver dollars, including 4.05663.58 silver dollars and 4.587183.4 silver dollars for remittance.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Jiangjiao Recovers and Copper Coins Remain Unchanged <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the small silver coins in the south of the Yangtze River rose by 2 yuan in the early market, reaching 822 yuan. At the close of the noon market, they continued to rise by 4 yuan, reaching 826 yuan. As a result, they rose by 6 yuan compared to the previous day. In the early market, 4,000 jiao were traded, and 6,000 jiao were traded in the noon market. The small silver coins in Guangdong were the same at 749 yuan in both the early and noon markets, which was slightly better by 1 jiao compared to the previous day. In the early market, 140,000 jiao were traded,</p>
<p>and 60,000 jiao were traded in the noon market. Copper coins were 323,000 wen, with no change compared to the previous day. The transaction price was 9,600 foreign dollars, totaling 31,008 strings of wen.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e222">Public Bonds Recover with a Small Breeze <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Good 3 jiao to 6 jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to a couple of brokers switching from short to long, the price rose. After a period of weakness, there has not been a major price drop,</p>
<p>making the short sellers impatient. The foreign interest rate was only 6 points, and the silver market appeared to be loosening. In reality, even if the interest rate was small, borrowing money was still extremely difficult. It was apparently loose but actually tight.</p>
<p>Earlier, Zhejiang issued 20 million in new public bonds and mortgaged them to the financial community. The scope of bank lending has become increasingly narrow. Therefore, the future of the bond market is only a small recovery, which is already difficult. The amount of floating capital is surging, and there is no way out. Yesterday, when the market opened, the prices of the 56th and 51st companies, who were short sellers, immediately rose by 2 jiao to 3 jiao to 5 jiao or 6 jiao, causing the retail investors to panic slightly. The secondary market made up for it slightly, and the prices continued to rise by 1 jiao or 2 jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, the upward momentum was obviously weak. The 56th and 51st companies felt that they were unable to pull the prices up, and the market price immediately became chaotic, with high and low prices alternating, and the number was only 1 jiao or 2 jiao. At the close, the long sellers were slightly absent, and the major customers stopped buying, and the prices uniformly recovered slightly by 2 jiao or 3 jiao. This kind of recovery may not continue, and the future cannot be viewed optimistically. The result of the market price was a rise of 3 jiao to 6 jiao.</p>
<p>The total number of transactions was 16,155,000 yuan. In addition, the number of shares in this exchange was 10 shares. The number of shares has now increased, and a comparative table is listed below. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e223">New York Specialty Stocks Have More Fluctuations <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>A report from the Xinfeng Foreign Firm states that yesterday (the 8th) trading on the New York Stock Exchange was quiet and prices were slightly lower. The price fluctuations of certain specialty stocks, however, were quite large. Speculators are perplexed by the drop in silver stocks. The price of silver in New York and London is very high due to purchases and speculative activity by the US government. Some believe that this is due to Washington's shift to the right. The purchase of dividend stocks is continuous. The small exchange and the bond market are slightly higher than the odds and ends. The demand for US government bonds is quite high. Chicago wheat is trending lower. The total transaction volume for the day was 450,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>6th 8th Up and Down</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 92.85 92.50 Fall 0.35</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 55.97 35.61 Fall 0.36</p>

<p>The yarn market is slightly firm because the sales of spot yarn are becoming more active. The procurement from various ports in the south is relatively strong, which makes people feel firm. As for the increase in the estimated output of American cotton,</p>
<p>the price has not changed much. Therefore, it has failed to arouse the interest of speculators.</p>
<p>However, most people think that the yarn price has fallen by 18 or 19 yuan compared to its peak, so they are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Jinji Scattered Short Covering <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The market opening before the ban on yarn was flat, as was the price of American cotton.</p>
<p>Both the long and short sides were also bleak and listless. There were very few transactions, and there was little fluctuation in each month. When it was taken to the second and third markets, it was heard that the sales of spot yarn were still good. The scattered short sellers covered their positions, and the market gradually became tight. Each month rose by 1, 2, and 4 jiao. When it was taken in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was still strong.</p>
<p>Some said that there was a rumor that the unified tax on cotton yarn would be increased. Whether this is true or not remains to be proven by the facts. This caused short covering. At the same time, it was heard that there were more than 2,000 packages of spot yarn transactions. Tomorrow is National Day, and the market will be closed for one day. Both the long and short sides want to cover the straight overnight to avoid the risk of eaves. Therefore, the market atmosphere is relatively tight. However, when it was taken to the closing time, the distant months were again flat. As a result, each month rose by 2, 3, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 22,500 bales. It was found that Hengyi sold 550 bales, Ruichang sold 400 bales, Changyu sold 800 bales, Yuan Yi sold 400 bales, Chongan sold 450 bales, Tongxing sold 450 bales, Xiesheng sold 850 bales, and Yuda sold 350 bales. Shenji bought 1,050 bales, Renfeng bought 1,250 bales, Hengchang bought 400 bales, Changfeng bought 800 bales, Deji bought 500 bales, Tongfu bought 350 bales, Taixing bought 300 bales, Yuande bought 350 bales, and Senkang bought 350 bales.

<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that the total number of bales bought by various groups throughout the day was 2,305,</p>
<p>and the market price was similar to that of the previous day. The amount bought by each group is as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market rebounded, and the situation was tight. The US cotton third estimate announced that the output would increase by 191,000 bales. The sellers in the market were not strong, and the market price fell slightly, but the multi-party sentiment stabilized. Therefore, the market price rebounded, but there were still no new buyers, because there was news that the sources from various places were surging.</p>

<p>The cotton market opened flat because the US cotton estimate was announced without much weight. Speculators did not take any action, so the market price was flat. However, there were more retail investors covering their positions, and each month rose by 1 and 2 jiao. In the afternoon, some said that the US cotton market would have the ability to rebound tomorrow, and the buying atmosphere was strong again.

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market situation was serious. The government report was favorable to the bulls, but this was offset by sluggish spot sales and a poor cloth market. Spot prices fell five points per pound.</p>
<p>Futures prices fell one to seven points per pound. British cotton futures rose three to four points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to bull liquidation, but later rebounded due to short covering. As a result, Bengal rose one rupee, and Oomra and White Broach rose 1.25 rupees.

<p>Another shipment of foreign wheat is confirmed</p>
<p>Futures wheat consistently decline</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market opened lower due to reports of lower prices from abroad by 3-4 jiao. Spot foreign wheat also followed suit. The factories immediately started selling off their stock, causing the price to open lower and then gradually decline. At noon, prices for all months fell by 1-2 fen. In the afternoon, another shipment of foreign wheat was confirmed, causing the price to fall another 5 fen compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>It was only 4.57 yuan, and foreign merchants were still lowering prices to sell, so the first session in the afternoon saw another sudden drop of 2-3 fen, 4-5 fen lower than the previous day's closing price. Fortunately, the northern merchants made small purchases, and the market stabilized again. The closing price for this month was down 2.75 fen, next month was down 4.25 fen, December was down 3.75 fen, January was down 4 fen, and February was down 3.75 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market opened higher in the morning due to the rebound the previous day. Hoarders liquidated and new shorts sold, and foreign wheat prices were reported lower, causing flour prices to fall. Sentiment was weak, and the opening price was immediately 4-5 fen lower. In the afternoon, with the confirmation of a shipment of foreign wheat and the flour market declining further, selling pressure on the market increased, and the decline was even greater. As a result, October was down 8 fen, November was down 6 fen, and December and January were down 7 fen each. February was down 9 fen. 1,000 bags of spot wheat were opened and handled by Fuxin, Gaofeng, and Shenda. Gao Che wheat was 3.30 yuan, with medium and lower grades also declining.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Kiln Middle Baige Falls by 3 Jiao <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the sources of goods were slightly more plentiful, with over twenty numbers arriving, totaling over 3,000 shi. Sales were normal, and sentiment was even weaker. In addition, the National Day holiday was the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sellers with more new goods were eager to sell, making the situation even weaker. Although there were purchases, such as the Qingdao merchants buying over 200 bags of kiln middle grade,</p>
<p>it did not reverse the trend. Furthermore, the local sales of Baige were sluggish, leading to price cuts to attract buyers, causing prices to plummet. The price of kiln middle Baige fell by 3 jiao. New white rice and other thick new japonica rice arrived in small quantities and softened accordingly. Only new Du Yangjian was in short supply, and the stores were eager to stock up, so it remained firm. Other varieties of broken rice and Yantai rice were handled late in the evening, close to 100 bags of late rice, but because the local market was stagnant, the overall market was flat and weak. The exchange rate also continued to be sluggish, and the price gradually depreciated. New exchange bills were in short supply and had no market. New white coins opened at 9.40 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai North: Yesterday, the first 21 or 22 boats arrived from the river merchants. All goods on the market</p>
<p>were selling well. New and old white japonica rice and new Yang Du tip and old white coin were trading well. Kiln rice was scarce. The remaining goods were flat. Broken japonica and white coins were firm. New Yangbu tip and new japonica rice showed a slight softening trend. New Du tip arrived in small quantities and rose several fen. Old Bu tip and old guest tip prices were firm.</p>
<p>Hardware: Dong White Iron will have incoming goods</p>
<p>Since the disaster in Osaka, where Dong White Iron was hit by a typhoon, deliveries have been cut off. As a result, the local market has seen soaring prices. The trend is so strong that it is almost unique in Shanghai. The price of 3-foot 6-inch sheets has risen to 1.26-1.27 yuan per sheet, and 3-foot 7-inch sheets are estimated at 1.45-1.46 yuan per sheet. However, customers who are slow to purchase are generally unable to buy the goods. According to news from the tea house yesterday, a foreign firm revealed that Dong goods will be available in Shanghai around the 20th of this month, as all the machines have been restored.</p>
<p>However, only the raw material for Western black iron sheet has fallen. Therefore, the local market may change in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Celebrating the Double Tenth Festival <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>I remember that the American poet Whitman, in his essay "Democratic Vistas," mentioned that the United States was already a democratic government, while Asian countries such as China and Turkey were still extremely autocratic regimes. He deeply felt that this was something for America to be proud of. Who knew that several decades later, a wave of revolution would rise in East Asia, overthrowing the autocratic regimes of thousands of years. Therefore, the Xinhai Revolution, in itself, had special significance. In other words, although the Xinhai Revolution could not contribute to the whole world like the French Revolution, the sudden thunderclap in the thick autocratic atmosphere of Asia naturally caused a lot of waves among Asian nations. This is what we can say.</p>
<p>However, some people may say that the United States embarked on the path of constitutionalism after the revolution, while China has been in a chaotic situation for more than twenty years since the revolution, and they feel emotional about the future of the country. In fact, this is not surprising. We must know that the United States' path to constitutionalism was not achieved overnight. At the beginning of the founding of the country, there were also party struggles, and political stability was only achieved after a civil war. It is not that Americans are descendants of the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxon character, as the British political theorist Burke said, has always had a spirit of love for freedom. They follow their past traditions, and the success of a democratic government is naturally easier. The legacy of Chinese history is exactly the opposite. Under such circumstances, it is naturally easy to be exploited by politicians and warlords.</p>
<p>This year is the 23rd anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. "After great chaos, there must be great order." If the chaos of the past many years has been great enough, then the hope for the future is not far away. This year's Double Tenth Festival is even more worthy of special commemoration.</p>

<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Three young men, all wearing Western suits, two wearing peaked caps, and another tall man wearing a tilted felt hat.</p>
<p>With red eyes, staggering around, mumbling, they turned out of the door of a tavern.</p>
<p>On Double Tenth Festival, the streets of the city were filled with party flags and national flags hanging in front of shops. Banners advertising "Double Tenth Big Bargain" were everywhere. The loudspeakers and drums on the upper windows of the shops beat powerfully. The streets were more lively than usual.</p>
<p>— It's Double Tenth Festival!</p>
<p>— It's a day to look for happiness!</p>
<p>— Let's have a good time all night long!</p>
<p>They laughed, ha ha.</p>
<p>— Today is National Day!</p>
<p>— National Day is a good day for us!</p>
<p>The three of them danced and gesticulated on the street. The tall man held a thin cigar, and the two wearing peaked caps whistled.</p>
<p>— It's the song of the Double Tenth Festival!</p>
<p>— Who says it isn't?</p>
<p>Under the streetlights, the smiling girls swayed their waists, walking in front, one after another.</p>
<p>The three men quickened their pace, following closely behind.</p>
<p>— Today is a day to look for happiness!</p>
<p>Then, they confusedly took the women into a room on the fifth floor.</p>
<p>The glaring electric light, the peach-colored wallpaper, the calendar on the wall was red.</p>
<p>The tall man hugged the woman, kissing her, the smile on her crimson lips becoming a line. He took his felt hat, which had been with him for several years of wandering, and put it on the woman's head, completely covering her eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>— Today is the Double Tenth Festival!</p>
<p>— Give us a smile, girl.</p>
<p>— Girl, sing a National Day song!</p>
<p>— Sing it! Our whistle is a better mandolin than anything else!</p>
<p>The woman shook her head with a smile. She couldn't sing such a song.</p>
<p>The room was filled with the strong smell of wine and the mixed aroma of cigar and face powder.</p>
<p>Intoxicated dusk!</p>
<p>The lantern parade of elementary school students passed through the street below the foreign building. The street was filled with the cheers of young lives.</p>
<p>In the room upstairs, a few intoxicated hearts heard the slightly disturbing sounds and felt uneasy.</p>
<p>One of the men wearing a peaked cap jumped up, closed the window, and then drew the curtains.</p>
<p>After the street quieted down, a few beggars sucking in the cold wind were left, wriggling on the cement ground; in the dim streetlights, they stared blankly—</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival of the 23rd year of the Republic of China has passed again!</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Longmian Rural School as I Saw It <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Long</p>
<p>Before discussing the topic, I would like to briefly talk about the culture and education of Tongcheng. In the past, Tongcheng indeed had several teachers and respected scholars who struggled to maintain it for hundreds of years, and they still enjoyed a little bit of a reputation at home and abroad. Now, it is extremely declining!</p>
<p>Education is related to culture. Since culture is declining, education is also lagging behind. However, Tongcheng was one of the earliest places to open schools. After the Sino-Japanese War, the whole country advocated reform. Mr. Wu Zhipu returned from Japan after studying education and was the first to open a school in his hometown. In terms of age, it is almost a twin brother of "Peking University." Today, the school founded by Mr. Wu still exists in name, but in essence, it is difficult for us to describe it!</p>
<p>To the north of Tongcheng, close to "Mount Longmian," connecting to Mount Tianzhu and Mount Qian, a continuous mountain range of thousands of miles, green and unbroken. Millions of people in the mountains rely on carrying firewood and selling charcoal to make a living. These poor friends and their children have no chance to know "words," and "education" is even more irrelevant to them.</p>
<p>More than twenty years after the founding of the Republic of China, there was a man in Tongcheng who studied elementary education, surnamed Wang, named Huaying. He wanted to independently run a "Longmian Rural School" in this mountain. First, he came to me to discuss it, and I strongly agreed. But I deplored that my life was too short, and I had to run around all year to find food. If I were to run such an education to help out-of-school people, I would be ashamed! I am a clay Bodhisattva. Although I have the heart to save the world, if I were to rescue people from the water, I am afraid that I could not protect myself. I saw that he had great motives, so I, based on my enthusiasm, planned for him: how to get started, how to arrange things, how to teach, and finally, I encouraged him a few words: "Wu Xun of Shandong was a beggar, and he was able to single-handedly found schools in Tangyi, Linqing, and Guantao counties. Liang Rengong wrote a biography for him, and the Ministry of Education praised him, making him famous at home and abroad. Moreover, you are someone who studied education?"</p>
<p>His belief became even more determined from then on. He abandoned all his duties and focused on the "Longmian Rural School." (Various newspapers in Anhui and Shanghai have reported on this matter.) Now, it has actually been opened for a long time.</p>
<p>Here, I would also like to interject and describe the purpose of his running this school, which is to adopt the principle of integrating construction and education. Although there are fixed rooms for classrooms, mobile classrooms are used in the form of open-air lectures. Textbooks are taken from the real objects of nature (agriculture, such as forests, fruits, grains, vegetables, etc.; industry, such as wood, iron, copper, tin, etc.). Students are all recruited from farmers and workers and their children, regardless of age or level. However, teaching must be divided into categories. After each subject is taught, it is called "completion of the course," not "graduation." Generally speaking, those who study in this school are all capable of producing. They produce while receiving education, which is very much in line with the conditions of "production education" and "education production."</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to briefly describe the landscape of this place. Mr. Dai Nanshan once used the four words "beauty surpassing human decline" to praise it. It is a pity that although the mountains and rivers are beautiful, education and culture are not commensurate! It is as if an ugly woman with a broken lip and missing teeth is wearing an extremely gorgeous and colorful dress. Passers-by cannot help but shake their heads and say, "What a waste of silk!" Famous mountains and scenic spots are mutually comparable with humanities. Tongcheng already has the natural scenery of "beauty surpassing human decline," and education and culture are so backward. Isn't it also making the mountain spirits lose their color? Now that this brand-new school has suddenly appeared, it is not only the fortune of the local area, but also adding a lot of color to the mountain spirits!</p>
<h3 id="e238">Double Tenth Memories <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>At the end of the Qing Dynasty, I was very young, so I don't know anything about the Double Tenth Revolution at that time, but the small changes that occurred at home are still vaguely remembered today.</p>
<p>It was a late autumn morning. Although frost had not yet appeared in the fields, the lined clothes we were wearing were not enough to keep us warm. My idle uncle took me to the earthen wall outside the door, leaned against the mulberry tree with half-yellow leaves, and sat on the stone roller (used by farmers to flatten the soil).</p>
<p>In the fields warmed by the sun, broad beans had just sprouted tender seedlings an inch or two long from the moist black soil, but the dragon's whisker vegetables were already growing lush green, densely covering the fields. The land prepared for planting wheat had also been turned over, facing the clear autumn sky, emitting the fresh smell of mud. This was a very good time of late autumn in the Chengdu plains.</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>My uncle suddenly exclaimed with a gasp. I immediately followed his eyes to look. It turned out that on the small road with pink and white wild chrysanthemums beside the field with dragon's whisker vegetables, six or seven strong men in short clothes and black cloth hoods were walking towards us, all with short knives with sheaths made of raw yellow cowhide hanging on their waists. As for whether they had guns, I couldn't remember.</p>
<p>"Ah, Zhenzhen wa'er!" (The two characters "wa'er" must be pronounced as one sound)</p>
<p>My uncle recognized an acquaintance and muttered to himself in a low voice like this, but he didn't shout it out. But the crab-faced man at the head waved his hand holding the knife handle from afar, and shouted to my uncle in a loud voice:</p>
<p>"Old Mo! Do you recognize me? Go tell your uncle that Grandpa Chen is here!"</p>
<p>He knew that my father and my uncle called my grandfather "uncle." My uncle was so frightened that his face turned red and he couldn't answer for a while.</p>
<p>At this time, my grandfather, having been informed by someone, had already led the brown mule used for irrigating the fields out of the door. With a frightened face, his lips trembled and he said:</p>
<p>"Old—" He had just uttered this one word, and then quickly changed his words, "Brother Chen, the mu—mule, you, you can take it."</p>
<p>The crab-faced man took the mule's reins from my grandfather, and at the same time widened his eyes and swung his chin to the left.</p>
<p>"Do you know? Old man! The government troops are coming soon. At that time, one knife for each person, one knife for each person, big and small, none will be left!"</p>
<p>Saying this, he swept his fierce eyes across me. Later, when I dreamed at night, if I encountered scary bandits, they would mostly have a crab's face and such a pair of terrible eyes.</p>
<p>He climbed onto the back of the big mule and said happily:</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid! Damn the government troops!"</p>
<p>Before leaving, he turned his head and shouted rudely at my grandfather:</p>
<p>"Don't worry! Old man, I'll return it to you when I beat back the government troops!"</p>
<p>After they left, my grandfather told us to go inside and quickly close the gate tightly.</p>
<p>At this time, my grandmother hobbled out of the house with her small feet, constantly wiping her wet hands on her blue cloth apron, and scolded my grandfather in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"What are we going to do to irrigate the fields next year! You, you, were still cursing last night: whoever takes your mule, you would fight with them to the death... You today... It's you yourself..."</p>
<p>At this time, my grandfather seemed to want to completely explode the anger he had been holding back, and he croaked back sharply:</p>
<p>"Everyone is rebelling now, if I don't give it to him, he will come in and rob you clean... even your clothes, even your pants!"</p>
<p>... ... ...</p>
<p>The next afternoon, my uncle carried me on his back, and my grandfather, grandmother, mother, and others, carrying luggage, left home together. My father and some other people stayed behind.</p>
<p>After my father sent us for a while, when he turned to leave, he told everyone:</p>
<p>"Sleep close to the earthen wall at night! Bullets will go through wooden boards."</p>
<p>Because my father had been to school, and recently visited Grandpa Pao at the market to become sworn brothers, and joined the anti-Qing Tongzhi Association, he knew that the government troops were already using foreign guns.</p>
<p>"Understood!"</p>
<p>My mother seemed to be answering with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, this was the first time I had ever been a refugee. But we didn't flee far, only to a relative's house two or three miles away.</p>
<p>A few days later, my father came to pick us up, saying that the revolution had succeeded and there was no more fighting, and we could return home safely. But when we got home, my grandfather found that the people who had stayed at home had killed all the chickens and ducks to eat, and had also lost the mule, so he scolded angrily for a while, and turned from being unfair to being dissatisfied with the family. Every year around the Double Tenth Festival, if the family talked about this escape, my grandfather would become especially dark-faced and scold people for no reason.</p>
<p>Now, having been away from my hometown for nine years, I don't know how many wars it has suffered. Thinking of my grandfather, who had suffered so much from being a refugee, he should have been peaceful about the past by this year's Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Take it down! We want to welcome the lantern parade! <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3 id="e240">Mr. Village Chief (2)(10)(3) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>Kai Yangma, who was sitting in the lower seat, felt it was necessary to mediate this argument because he was the host. He picked up the wine pot and poured a full cup for Mr. Dasheng, then poured wine for Mr. Feng Wen, Old Muren... in turn.</p>
<p>"Please drink! Don't keep nagging about those nonsense things. On the anniversary of the grandfather's death, shouldn't the descendants have a good drink? Uncle Muren, don't worry about those things either. The boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge gate. Will our subordinates let the predecessors eat the dates! When that time comes, when Awen becomes the village chief, will he not arrange a suitable position for you?"</p>
<p>This remark caused the people sitting on the side to exclaim good. Ah Xian, who was sitting on the edge of the bed, and Ah De Huoyan, who was sitting on a small bamboo chair, both nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes! Uncle Dasheng is of course only seeing things one way, pushing away and not caring... However, I think it's not certain whether there will be a second extraction. There's no need to talk about things getting bad now." Ah Xian joined in, saying. Ah Xian lived next door to Kai Yangma's house. But now he didn't come to eat the anniversary meal. He came empty-handed to hear the news.</p>
<p>"Yes! I think there won't be a second ex—" Ah De Huoyan also said in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>"There won't be a second extraction? Tsk, hum!" Mr. Dasheng's civilized voice came again. "There will definitely be an extraction! Definitely an extraction! The World War is coming, so surely we Chinese have to have some preparation? Everyone needs military training! Every able-bodied man needs military train! My child Wuda, he's also receiving military training at school! Humph! World War!"</p>
<p>A room full of surprised eyes, one by one, floated up. This pitch-black house, with gray corners everywhere, was now clearly reflected in everyone's eyes. The worn-out bed, used as a front and back partition, laden with a bed full of dust, lay gaspingly across the back. The sound of stir-frying vegetables and washing dishes also came over from the inner room.</p>
