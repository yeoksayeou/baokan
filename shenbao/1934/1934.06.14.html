<p>（南京）美國某報記者曾爲藏本失踪事、往日使館採訪消息、據其事後告人、當時據使館人員稱藏本於返家後、自道渠之隠藏、全由於「家事及昇遷太遲」之故、藏本不認計劃自殺、據藏本所述渠於星期五晚離日使館、送日大使有吉赴滬後、僱人力車往東門、潛行入城、未被駐運注意、旋登孝陵後紫金山、遙望入睡之城市、舉手過首、且揮且呼「再會罷、一切的一切」述至此、有人問以隠藏之原因何在藏本興奮而言、渠乃欲「遯跡」而已、是晚、據稱、渠於倉卒之間、着手築一風屏、以碎石堆成四壁、此數日中、藏本在山上、夜則搬石建築風屏、日則閒游於山麓、最初發現者爲一農人、時間在下午一時、渠方偃臥於此小舍中也、農人卽報告警署、藏本遂被帶至總部、</p>
<p>藏本到警署後、所留之時間甚暫、此時卽由署員詢問、渠卽宣稱、失踪乃係自動的、因上星期遺失某種公文、爲上司所讉責、未免難堪、據觀藏本之外貌、雖甚枯疲、但並無顯着之困頓及身體上之異狀、當美報訪員往警署時、藏本能道其名、其後對於外部人員亦然、渠云除覺腹中饑餓外、别無所苦也、有詢以目下回返都市、心中亦感欣悅否、藏木力言渠殊勿願返來、並稱、「余之返來甚不相宜、」更詢以對於妻孥作何打算、　本夷然言「若輩自有生存之道、」窺藏本之意、自警署返至日使館、殊無特殊之興味、今日下午五時、渠於外部、交由日總領須磨之手帶回日本領館、在京日本新聞記者、現尙不獲在日領署中訪問藏本、因領署中人稱、「體弱不能再行勞動」故也、但聞藏本在紫金山上時、曾至山脚下購取食物、則又不似體力衰頽一致於此、又外訊日方將令藏本備函向我外交部表示歉意（十三專電）</p>

<h3>德意兩首相會談之前途</h3>

<p>意奥匈。三國總揆會於羅馬之後。歐洲風雲。忽然變色。經濟合作之口號。僅爲一種表面文章實際作用。仍在於政治上之諒解。換言之。卽建立意大利中歐覇權之基礎是也。德意志旣不能充分得志於奥。撕毁凡爾賽和約之舉。復不克如願以償。東進政策。又爲蘇法一致所阻。外交上遂處兩難之境。旣不肯屈意以返國聯。又不能充分利用大陸諸國之矛盾。以自闢出路。於是德國外交。遂陷於泥塗中而難以自拔。在歐洲諸國。可與德爲友而又立於同一利害觀點。或相近似之立塲者。大國中僅意大利一國而已。在意奥匈三國諒解未成立之前意德間之諒解。或不甚難。進而聯合對法事亦可能。蓋意國亦爲凡爾賽條約之不平分子。其於國聯亦早倡改組之異議。德國則自法蘇接近以來。四週益受制限。於是意德之間。更易接近矣。第一意德旣同爲反國聯分子。不願英法一手把持。而欲重新估定歐洲之平衡關係。勢已瞭然。設使德國果能脫離和約覊絆者。則意國可借此以均分中歐之覇權。甚至擴展其北非之勢力。是意德根本立塲雖不同。其欲摧毁國聯之桎梏則一也。第二陸軍軍備意誠不弱於法。但新式武器。尤其是航空軍之設備與機械工業之底力。意大利皆不能與法比拚。其天賦資源又甚貧乏若不深結外援。善於利用外交上之對立關係。則意國殊不易保持其大國之地位。德國際此法蘇妥恊英國表面靜觀之時。自不能不堅持其軍備平等之主張。以鼓勵其國民之勇氣。增高其國際之地位意國則因不能敵法。而欲借德之力以自助。此意德可以籌商妥洽之又一原因也。有此兩原因。於是乎兩獨裁宰相乃有今日會晤於水鄕威尼斯之議。會談之内容究竟如何。吾人固不必一一加以預測。蓋由前此三國恊商之事。已可窺見其大意。除上述兩點以外。殊不易形成更爲有力之行動。以打破今日歐洲之現狀也。</p>
<p>夫奥國之所以抛棄與德國同種同文之關係而與意國親近者卽以德國國社黨過事魯莽。致與陶爾斐斯輩以難堪同時德國又不能行期給與奥國以海上出路。使彼經濟恐慌。早日恢復。遂促成意奥匈三國之諒解。儼然有經濟聯盟之勢。墨索里尼與希特勒晤談。苟不涉及政治經濟問題則已。如一且涉及政治經濟關係。則奥匈問題。立卽成爲當前之難關。更易激起兩個極端國家主義之尖銳對立。彼此皆欲藉奥國爲衛星。以爭握中歐之霸權。加以法蘭西左右其間。問題更愈見複雜矣。對蘇聯關係。就意德表面情勢。論以不致有甚大之捍格。然今日之德。旣不能積極與法一較短長。但不能不設法衝破四圍之一種弱點。以圖國力之發展。故對蘇採取積極攻勢。殆爲理勢所必然。在純粹理論上觀察。意國於此。或可同意。但事實上。亦詎願德國之盡量發展耶。歐戰前意大利原爲同盟國之一員。其後卒加入恊約方面而與德爲敵。前事可鑑也。故意德雙方。尙不免有互相警戒之意。於對蘇關係。尤爲顯明。且自多腦河流域諸小國。對法表示不滿後。意國頗擬乘機進取。樹立中歐霸權之意。德國於此。亦正亟思染指。詎肯讓意國獨占。是又爲意德不能恊調之另一因素也。然則意德兩國間之合作。最多僅能打破歐洲現狀之一階段。其餘則仍互相對立耳。</p>

<h3>張公權　暢論遊歷四川感想</h3>
<p>中國銀行總經理張公權氏、以此次遊川、頗多觀感、爰將考察所得、草成一文、以供各界向川省發展之參考、茲照錄如次、</p>
<h3>貨物入超金融枯竭</h3>
<p>此次遊歷四川、先至重慶·繼至内江·自流井·而至成都、由成都而嘉定·叙府·瀘州·折至重慶、又至北涪、來往四十五日、各省所固有之通病、如政治不良、租稅負擔過重、農民生活困苦、購買力低减、輸出入不能相抵、金融枯竭等、四川當然均兼有之、</p>
<h3>特殊之病共有四點</h3>
<p>第一爲防區制度、去年以前、四川幾分爲四五國、有廿一軍防區、廿四軍防區、有廿八軍、廿九軍、等區、儼然各自獨立、甚至租稅貨幣、均各自爲政、商貨轉運、經過一防區、卽須徴一次稅項、自二劉戰事終了、劉文輝退居西康、劉湘督辦之防區、大爲擴充、卽彼之勢力、已超出各軍之上、其他如楊·鄧·田·各軍勢力、逈不如前、但防區制度、依然存在、第二爲田賦重征、各防區因財政困難、每年田賦可征十餘次、平均至少爲七次、而人民不得不勉力擔負、其困苦可想而知、第三爲苛捐雜稅、各省均廢除厘金、而川省對於各種貨物之通過稅、幾樣樣有稅、設卡征收、無異變相厘金、第四貨幣不統一、現各省均改用大洋、獨川省有特殊之川洋成色較大洋爲低、每千元約低一百餘元、尙有他區行使小洋者、</p>
<h3>天產豐富思想好新</h3>
<p>四川人口、幾爲各省之冠、據云有七千萬、較日本一國爲多、而其蕃殖力、尙日見增加、務農者異常勤苦、吾輩遊歷所經之田、幾無曠十、田畝整齊、一望　知爲勤於工作之國民、次則天產豐富、地土肥沃、全省除棉花之外、幾於無物不產、所謂有人斯有土、有土斯有財、四川足以當之、惜其財用之養兵内戰有負此終歲勤勞之人民、天賦之寳藏耳、同時有一點可注意者、四川人思想好新、善於追逐潮流、如現在重慶有公庫、有證劵交易所、大致上海之事事物物、輸入極易、此亦將來四川革新之一大便利、社會不乏有志之士、如盧作孚君等苦心從事社會工作、努力精神建設、均可注意而忻快者也、</p>
<h3>今後希望各軍覺悟</h3>
<p>現劉湘督辦、努力從事剿匪、渠曾表示剿匪完成、卽從事善後、設法裁减軍隊、整理内部、而後從事建設、其愛護四川之熱誠、及整理四川之决定、與乎其個人立身之不苟、洵屬可佩、但最要者、仍在各軍覺悟、共同打消防區制度、使政治統一、財政統一、减輕人民負擔、有合理之稅則、庶幾豐民可以稍舒喘息、間接防止人民之流爲共產、直接促進生產之增加、然後可以談善後、可以期剿赤之成功、否則竊恐本末倒置耳、尤盼向來足未出四川之軍政當局、多到外省遊歷、使各省與夫南京上海多與四川溝通、則四川之進步建設、當更迅速、</p>
<h3>滬商對川應具眼光</h3>
<p>以四川人民之衆、物產之富、論其面積、幾同德國一國、所以四川一省、當視爲一上海工業之大市塲、在消費方面固不必說、即如棉紗一項、若四川一省果能安定、人民購買力稍稍增加、則上海各中國紗廠所出之棉紗不難盡爲四川一省所吸收、但若欲使四川爲上海製造品之推銷市塲卽須設法增加四川人民之購買力、要增加購買力、卽須增加四川人民之生產力、使生產增加、同時帮助四川推銷其物產、使四川之出口入口、可以相抵、故一方面應有技術人才、多往四川、帮助其計劃種種建設、一方面俟政治稍稍安定、幣制稍稍整理時、卽逐漸輸入資金、以增加其生產資金、此爲上海實業界應具之眼光要之、外省人當以深切之同情、多與四川人接近、以盡輔導之責也、</p>
<h3>發展大上海　市府發行公債　總額三百五十萬元　業經中政會議通過</h3>
<p>中央社云、本市居東亞巨埠、梯航雲集、人文薈萃、非特爲全國經濟及文化中心點、且爲國際觀瞻所繫、市政之規劃與改進、洵不容緩、本市市長吳鐵城、爲適應將來之需要與建設上之便利計、故積極謀新市區之發展、自市中心區本府新厦落成遷移以來市民觀聽、已爲一新、惟是事業之建設方殷、地方之資源有限、揆以本市原有收入、已虞不足抵支原辦事業之應用、遑云偉大之建設、爰由吳市長請求中央、准以本市捐稅作抵、發行本市二十三年七厘公債三百五十萬元、業經中央政治會議議决通過、一俟立法院審核通過後、卽可發行、據悉該項公債之用途、業經規定如下、</p>
<h3>建築育塲</h3>
<p>本市爲全國敎育中心、提倡體育、尤爲中央所特加重視、且下届全國運動會、已定於明年在本市舉行、而遠東運動會、亦將在上海舉行、故本市亟應籌建廣大之公衆體育塲、以應環境之需要、</p>
<h3>設立博物院</h3>
<p>近代科學昌明、整理國故、與推進新文化、有密切關係、本市地位之重要、對於博　物研究機關、尙付闕如、自　興辦公衆博物院、以興觀感、而故宮古物、存屬之一部份、現均租房存儲、如該院興建後、亦可酌量寄存保管、以免另覓會　儲錢、致多困難、</p>
<h3>創辦圖書館</h3>
<p>本市又爲人文薈萃之區、前確有商務印書館設立之東方圖書館、但於「一二八」一　、燬於日軍砲火之下、未能恢復、現在公私立之圖書館、均嫌設備簡陋、値茲提倡學術救國之際、本市亟應建設規模較具之公衆圖書館、以謀文化之復興、</p>
<h3>建築市醫院</h3>
<p>本市人口之稠密、甲於各大都市、對於民衆衛生、應有完善之設備、故市府方面、現將於公債中劃出一部分、建築一完善之市立醫院、俾全市市民、均得醫藥上之便利及安全</p>
<h3>舉辦屠宰塲</h3>
<p>本市爲亞東最大商埠、卽就宰牲一事、在租界上已早經改良、並由租界當局設立屠宰塲以備應用、而華界尙無此項設備、與市民公共衛生關係非淺、雖經市府籌議舉辦、祇因限於財力、未能實現、故此次發行公債後、此事卽將舉辦</p>
<h3>修理各馬路</h3>
<p>本市自一二八事變後、閘北一帶、災區遼闊、雖經舉集戰後復興公債、以資救濟、僅能完成一部工作、目前之急待整理擴充者、如（甲）毘連特區各馬路及橋梁之建設、與修理工程、（乙）修築溝渠、（丙）完成中山路、（丁）建築並改善水電路等、此皆與發展市中心區有極大關係、故一俟公債成交後、卽可動工云、</p>
<h3>陳公博昨晋京　報告視察南洋經過</h3>
<p>實業部長陳公博、前偕同商標局長何焯賢、赴南洋一帶視察、十一日晨、乘輪返滬、稍事休息、昨日下午四時零五分、陳氏由北站乘京滬車晋京、向中央報告視察經過、</p>
<h3>財孔今晨來滬</h3>
<p>財政部長孔祥熙、昨乘夜快車出京、今晨抵滬、</p>
<h3>日使有吉　電日報告藏本尋獲　日使館昨午四時已接京通知</h3>
<p>中央社云、日本駐京副領事藏本英明、於八日夜、在京失蹤後、頗引起中外人士之注意、行政院長兼外交部長汪精衛得悉後、卽訓令首都軍警、全體出動搜尋、而日本駐泊滬漢等處之軍艦、亦奉令紛紛駛泊下關江面、於是益引起中外人士之注意、茲悉藏本副領事、已於昨日下午一時許、在首都明孝陵、經我方尋獲、卽送至首都警廳、外交部得報後、卽書面通知南京日總領事須磨、須磨卽於四時許、由京滬長途電話報告有吉公使、茲將本埠所得消息、分誌如次、</p>
<h3>我方努力搜尋</h3>
<p>藏本副領事、於八日夜、有京失蹤後、首都警察廳及警備司令部、卽奉令四出搜查、日以夜繼、而日使館警務署長淸水、亦派員恊同搜尋、多日無結果、而駐泊上海江面之對馬葦號·及停泊長江上游之各日艦、亦均奉令陸續駛京、駐泊下關江面、同時首都日僑認藏本在首都失蹤、顯係我國保護不力所致、頗形憤激、於是藏本失蹤事件、數日來日見嚴重</p>
<h3>明陵附近發現</h3>
<p>迄至昨日下午一時許、藏本副領事始於明陵安全發現、其發現經過、據本埠日方消息、昨日下午一時許、明陵陵役、在無意中、於附近發現一日人、當時尙不知彼卽數日來搜查不得之藏本副領事、乃向首都警察廳報告、警察廳得報後、卽派武裝警士兩人、便服偵探一人、前往發現地點尋認屬實後、卽雇車送至警察廳、日方得悉後、亦派員趕往明陵尋認、其時藏本副領事、已送至警察廳矣、</p>
<h3>滬日領署消息</h3>
<p>又據本埠日本總領事署情報處代表岩井英一、語中央社記者、藏本副領事在京發現、上海總領事館、已得到此項報告、發現詳情未悉、岩井並云、南京總領事須磨、於四時後用京滬長途電話、向有吉公使報告稱、「南京日總領事署頃得中國外交部正式通知稱、藏本副領事、已於本日（卽昨日）下午發現」、詞句甚簡、故詳細情形、無從見告云云、</p>
<h3>有吉電日報告</h3>
<p>有吉公使得報後、卽電達東京外務省報告、並悉駐滬日本總領事館、因藏本發現情形、迄至下午五時止、尙未接得詳細報告、故昨特延長辦公時間、俾待電訊云、</p>
<h3>俄大使已返滬　中俄一切外交懸案　雙方迄未進行交涉</h3>
<p>蘇俄駐華大使鮑格莫洛夫、曾於上月赴平視察談地僑民狀况後、卽由平往津、會晤我國駐俄大使顏惠慶博士、並招待津市新聞界、以示聯絡、旋卽南下抵京、參加上星期五外部新厦路成典禮、茲悉鮑氏業於前晨由京返滬、下榻外灘蘇俄領事公館、關於中俄一切外交懸案、據新新社記者由外交界方面探悉、彼此迄未進行交涉、至外間所傳中俄互不侵犯條約及中俄商約等、業經中俄外交當局商談就緒之說、恐係出於一種推測云、</p>
<h3>中央銀行投資　建設全國糧食倉庫　八省糧食運銷局將改由中央主辦　糧食倉庫先建築上海開封等八處</h3>
<p>申時社云、八省糧食會議、所產生之糧食運銷局、原由蔣委員長極力主持進行、股本二百萬元、由各省分别攤派一百萬元、中央負責借貸一百萬元、無如各省應繳</p>
<p>薪、無濟於事、因此糧食運銷局籌備主任顧聲馨一·副主任吳桓如·進止爲難、日前赴贛請示、陳明一切困難情形、但蔣氏仍主積極進行、如各省不再繳欵、决將已繳各欵、如數退還、完全由中央出資主辦、當時孔祥熙適在贛、卽由蔣氏面諭飭財孔籌劃、由中央銀行出資進行、</p>
<h3>顧馨一連日訪財孔</h3>
<p>此次中央銀行總裁孔祥熙於財政會議結束後來滬、以糧運局旣奉蔣氏面諭、必須遵令實行、曾迭邀顧馨一氏商談進行辦法、並由顧氏報告糧運局一切籌備情形及各省市繳欵數目、孔氏以爲糧運局之組織、原由商人出資辦理、今以商股未能繳齊、若由中央主持、勢須變更組織、且須與全經會宋子文商酌、將來此項機關、或須隷屬全經會、合併於籌組成立之糧食統制會、故允於日内研究一切章則、再與宋氏商酌後、俾决定具體辦法、</p>
<h3>投資建設全國倉庫</h3>
<p>申時社記者昨向中央銀行探悉、孔氏對於糧運局、已願積極籌劃進行、惟最主要者、爲建設糧食倉庫問題、因運銷局最重要之作用、在調節糧良、換句話說、卽由國家力量、統制糧食市價、農民有餘糧時、糧運局卽大批收購、長期存儲、農民缺糧時、則出倉儲、大量供給、此爲供求調節之總樞紐、各地非有廣大之糧食倉庫、不足以應付、現孔氏已决定在上海·南京·蕪湖·九江·漢口·長沙·開封·洛陽·等八處、先行建築大規模之新式倉庫各一處、至少可儲備三百萬元之糧食、以備不時之需、所須經費、每處約需五十萬元、共爲四百萬元、當由中央銀行投資建築、此項倉庫之建築、上海市政府原擬進行、且有詳細預算、及甲·乙·丙·丁·四科建築計劃、後以經費籌集爲難、中止進行、現孔總裁已囑市府當局、將是項建築計劃、呈備參考、</p>

<h3>補助華絲出口　中外商輪减收運費　國内絲繭减收半價　運美絲每件收二元</h3>
<p>中央爲救濟華絲出口、除關於改革絲蠶辦法十項、早經實業部公布到滬外、中有减輕絲繭運輸費用、及各項捐稅等等、由行政院轉令交通財政各部、分飭所屬各關係機關辦理、本埠中外輪公司、亦已得到該項令文、業經擬定减短水脚、以促進華絲之輸出矣茲將所聞情形、分述如下</p>
<h3>國内半價收費</h3>
<p>本埠各輪公司、得到交部轉來訓令後、對於救濟絲蠶之减短絲繭桑苗等項之運費、本埠國營招商局首先議定、凡屬局輪通行之埠、如遇有絲繭桑秧報裝者、准予特别减價收費、議定照各路所訂之運費價目一律以對半收取以示優惠之意、業經該局呈報交部、轉咨實業部矣、至於其他民營各輪公司、與鐵道各路綫、亦各擬减、收絲繭等運率矣、</p>
<h3>外輪减價運裝</h3>
<p>中美間太平洋内各郵船、向來上海出口貨、以華絲爲最多、各輪公司平日亦以競載湖絲爲最烈、由上海至美各埠、若舊金山西雅圖、或坎拿大溫古華每件湖絲、重一百十二磅、昔時需運費十二元美金、後因互相爭裝、跌至六元七角半、近因出口額日少、輪公司又繼續以跌價號召、每件减收至五元、復跌至四元、最後至三元一件、可謂無復最廉矣、近因我國政府救濟出口華絲特函請洋商輪商、亦酌予减費、俾輕成本滬上太平洋水脚公會、特召集各輪公司代表磋商、結果、自本月十一日起、凡由滬運美之華絲、每件再跌價一元、祇收美金兩元、昨已知照各郵船一律實行、據輪公司中人言、照現在水脚、僅足付上下駁送及存棧等項工資、在輪公司殊無貨脚可得也、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>怎樣做讀書筆記　丨丨答王韶華君</h3>
<p>以前我們在「讀書方法論的討論」上，就略微討論過做剳記的方法，最近王韶華君又重新把這問題提出來，他的來信說：</p>
<p>「······據老前輩說：「讀書必得要寫筆記」。但是我們知道，寫筆記對於時間是太不經濟的，我們必須看到相當的程度、纔會發生興趣，纔能動手抄寫。這是多麽躭擱功夫啊！我們業餘自修者，讀書的光陰是千金一刻，非常寳貴。而且，鈔寫起來，日積月累，册帙定然可觀，看第二次，也是要費很多的時間。若用這些寳貴光陰去看别的新書，或許能獲得更多的智識。所以我覺得做筆記有點得不償失，是不是？但老前輩又那麽說，因此，使我猶豫不决，請過來人的先生們暫我斟酌一下。」</p>
<p>的確，有許多人總覺得做剳記是一椿於時間太不經濟的事，把做剳記的時間去看些旁的書不是獲益更多些麽，這種懷疑很常有的。但做剳記所用的時間並不會如你所說的浪費，其原因就是我們求知識一方面固應進取，同時亦要顧到防守，做剳記是一種後防的工作，它使已獲得的知識系統化，深刻化。反之，如果一個人不能把他所得的知識，自已加上點消化作用，把精華提鍊出，渣滓排洩去，將它深刻化，那儘管吸收得多，像流寇打天下一樣，只攻不守，也是一無用處，至多我們祇能加他一個前幾天所討論的「書獃子」的徽號。假如我們把排好的字板的鉛字倒翻，亂七八糟混在一起，那就完全失掉了字板的作用，祇是一堆鉛字了。</p>
<p>我們在現在研究學問，讀書，較古人是要便利多了。各種科學難說還在創造，和繼續不斷的研究中，但都已確立了一個系統。所以在初讀某一種學科的人，應當先讀該學科的槪論書籍，更應當把這槪論裏所叙述的該學科的一般槪念澈底的了解，並能記憶其要點。做筆記就是靶龐大的方面，縮成簡短的幾句，使你便於記憶，使你更加經濟。</p>
<p>普通做筆記，大半是用的摘要式的方法，把所讀的一本書，按照章節，把它的重要點節錄下來，好像是做一個縮本。這雖是最笨的方法，然而對於初學的人是很有用處的，因爲它可以訓練讀者怎樣地把握每一問題的核心，同時可使讀者的記憶力集中，不致浪費。</p>
<p>做筆記進一步的方法自在能不照書選鈔爲妙，就是他自已能够再加一番反省。我們在把所讀的書讀完之後，把那一門學科所研究的内容或對象先弄淸白，再把這内容仔細地回憶起來，然後再動手去做。所以做筆記所用的功夫，七分是在「想」　，寫是祇占「三」成。這是做摘要的原則。</p>
<p>其次，我們要討論一下做這類筆記的具體方法。首先，我們可把所讀的書，名稱，目錄，緒論，結論，頁數，出版的年月，作者的立塲，及讀時所費的時間等，很簡單地叙述一下。然後，我們就可把這書的内容，就自已所記憶的，用自已的句了寫下來。我們不必拘於原書的格式，我們要照自已的方便和自已的意見去寫。原書把一椿事或因篇幅關係，分成數章來寫，或因叙述的便利起見，把這一部分與那一部分的叙述分開得很遠，但我們所要獲得的是系統的知識，烏瞰的綱要，所以我們可以把繁重的零碎的叙述放棄，分開來講的東西聯系起來。至於叙述的方式固然愈簡潔愈好，但却不能把重要的内容遺漏掉。如果自已興趣濃厚的話，多寫一點也是沒有什麽關係的。</p>
<p>不論是那一本書，我們不能說是完全無缺憾。不論是怎樣的認眞，初讀某一種學科書時也常有不能了解的地方。事守上讀者對於作者竟見的齟齬和懐疑，對於某一部分不能透澈了解，定所難免。如果遇到了這種問題，同時又不能解决，那就不必過分壓制自已的見解，盲從書本，你在内容叙述過之後，可再將這些問題逐一記下來。這可作你將來進一步研究的重心，我們研究學問興趣所以逐漸濃厚，就是研究愈深，問題也愈多。你要解决這些問題，就必需再做進一步的研究，而因此，你的學問上的成就，自然也就愈深入了。所以這部分在筆記上也是很必要的。</p>
<p>總之，做筆記是帮助你將所獲得的知識系統化，深刻化，並留備日後參考之用的。它的主要的目的，却着重在防守，古人說做學問好比「紥硬塞打死仗」，這是非常有理的話，我們如果因爲後防的防禦工事所花費的時間，比起進擊中的認爲不合算，那是很大的錯誤了。</p>

<p>移民敎養所之拓殖敎育</p>
<p>日本爲海中之蕞爾小島、領土不及吾國十七分之一、而人口之比例、殆難望其項背、日本本邦人口約有六千餘萬、每年平均約增七十五萬、千人中軍增十四人、每方里人口密度爲二六○二人、此不過指内地而言、各大都市猶未歸納在焉、日多山地、雖無山不綠、無地不耕、（吾人行經别府鄕村、道旁一分一厘之地、亦盡利用其生產）然可耕之地、祇佔全國總面積七之一、供應究屬相差、矧一般女子又出而服務社、凡食堂旅舍等侍者、汽車電車等售票員、各商店店夥、以及男子之浴室、莫不賴女子之服役、遂令一部份男子無業可尋卒致失業、去歲全世界失業工人逹四千五百萬、美以人口多、失業者有一四·○○○·○○○、次則推英海日本、日之失業人數爲五三○·○○○、若以人口比例之、數當驚人、歲暖而號寒、年豐而啼飢、舉國騒然、無怪其殖民政策、益有急轉直下、刻不容緩之勢、於是拓殖省省成立矣、拓殖學校由台泫灣協會學校升格爲拓殖大學矣、其主要對象、無非在我、飛艇巨砲之侵略、固應抵抗、而拓殖敎育之暴戾恣睢、要亦用心提防、</p>

<p>一般平民之進移民敎養所、先由政府到處張貼募集移民巴西之廣告、廣告大且多、吾人旅居内地亦常寓目、廣告上並載鼓勵之詞及說明、每人可得五十金之津貼、全家前往者尤爲歡迎、以便若輩作永久之殖民、爲祖國開闢固定之樂土、使失業人有相當之出路、迨若輩向外之心旣堅了、乃有所謂海外演、講會從事初步之敎養、然後由海外移會社辦理手續、送入該校入校最要條件爲身體檢查、身體缺陷中如有砂眼發現則絶對無入校資格、因美利堅拒絶砂眼患者登陸故也、砂眼之在歐美、殆不多見、惟日本特多、吾國亦不少、世人稱之曰「東方病」皆傳染有以致之、身體檢查外、復行預防注射、深恐經越熱帶途中罹病、預防工、可謂周到、</p>

<h3>草地網球聯賽　中華會昨勝法商會　結果九比六前途頗樂觀　德孚潘禮費區勝邱飛海王文正</h3>
<p>草地網球聯賽昨日中華會對法商會比賽、事前預料、中華極端危險、蓋本届法商人材濟濟、欲圖霸業、但結果完全出於意料之外、中華以九比六獲勝、以此成績推論、中華會之前途、仍甚樂觀、</p>
<p>昨日第一組之比賽、最爲精彩、法商會由名聞中外之潘禮費區與德孚二人代表、其實力與潘禮費區與卡爾遜組、有過之無不及、邱飛海興王文正合組果能奪得一盤、殊非容易、但王究以資格欠缺、不能聯絡、然雙方表演、殊見精神、潘德</p>
<p>二人大刀闊斧、雙管齊下、向兩邊製擊、邱飛海盡力招架先以六比三勝第一盤、施以七比九之劇戰、失第二盤第三盤對手愈爲得手、邱王幾無招架能力、連負五局、極爲容易、最後以二比六敗、</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>國貨界應注意對外貿易</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨的出路，不僅僅在國内各地，更應推廣於國外市場。在這經濟恐慌徧布全世界的時代，無論那一個國家，都在那裏拚命的推廣出品的銷路。用盡種種方法，想盡種種計畫，一方求自已出品的暢銷，一方限制外貨的入口，所以像最善鑽營無孔不入的日貨，目下居然也是到處碰壁，有出路困難的現象。我國貨廠商在此情境之下，惟一自救的方法，惟有先從避免國内的競爭一致注意於國外貿易一途。須知同業傾軋，同業嫉妒，已爲過去的惡習，在今日絶對不應有此。凡屬國貨界人大家站在同一的步驟，以應當前的危機，由同業合作，進而爲非同業合作。努力求成本的低廉，出貨的精美，少者三年，多至五年，中國的國貨，不難角逐於國外市場。最近實業部長陳公博氏，到南洋攷察實業，其任務不僅把本國的生產界和國外的消費者聯成一氣，使我國國貨得以擴大其市塲，尤欲使南洋華僑，與當地政府，得有一種的相當交換。陳氏返國之後，極言南洋商業，頗有發展希望，當地僑胞，大都傾向祖國，尤其對於國貨非常熱心，一致樂於服用；惜乎國貨廠商，尙沒有强固的組織，以致不能盡量將國外市塲擴大。南洋僑胞都說，彼等極希望能多消費國貨，但來貨往往與當地所需者不能適合，如布疋的尺寸，商品的裝璜，以及服用者之心理，這是國貨在南洋不能盛銷的原因。聽了陳氏的報告，今後我廠商應一致注意於出品的選擇，投合南洋各地的所好，以擴大出路，尤其希望許多廠商聯袂赴南洋各地，作實際的攷察，爲友誼的聯絡，並帶各種出品，前往展覧，研究其嗜好，迎合其需要，改良製造，便利運輸，製造品可以仿照日本辦法，專製南洋暢銷的物品，能如是，則我國國貨，何難與日本等國競爭國外？是在廠商之眼光與魄力如何而已。</p>
<h3>靑滬實業家携手提倡國貨</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>靑島工業考察團，於五月十六日來申後，逐日排定日程，分往各工廠參觀，共有一旬之久。籌成與中華工業總聯合會幹事吳叔臣君，伴同前往，故所有各處宴會，亦均在被邀之列。而以二十四日在覺林蔬食處席上所談最有價値。</p>
<p>是日係中華職業敎育社，中華職業學校，中國化學工業社，中華鐵工廠，中華琺瑯廠，美亞織綢廠，五和織造廠第工團體出面公宴，推黃任之君致歡迎詞，黃君除推崇考察團諸君熱心提倡國貨外，并謂當此國難嚴重時期，「實業救國」四字，工業界自應服膺勿忘，靑島與上海兩處工業界，相互聯絡，已非一日，彼此均組考察團，而參觀工廠，上海方面，并曾集各工廠之出品，於去年赴靑開展覧會，所有成績，冠於他處，卽此一點，可見靑島同胞愛用國貨之熱忱，勝於其他各埠。所謂聯絡者，不是張姓與李姓兩家之聯絡，不是甲事與乙事兩事之聯絡，應有具體之組織，大致分兩種，（一）同業與同業之聯絡，不分區域，（二）不論同業與否，以區域爲限之聯絡，鄙人希望考察團諸君子，不以此次來滬參觀工廠後，回靑作一報告而了事，應乘此機會，想一有具體之組織，此事不獨於工業上有關係，於國際上政治上亦均有關係，卽以今日起，由靑滬兩地工業領袖，作爲携手之起點，努力於工業之發展，國貨之推銷，以塞漏巵，而挽國運。戰警堂團長致答詞謂：「普及敎育發展實業」八字，係今日救國要訣，前日參觀中華職業學校，見各學生手腦並用，體强耐勞，與普通之一般學校不同，可見在座諸先進，對於工業研究有素，殊堪欽佩，二十世紀係商戰時代，靑島前在德日之手，工業無從講起，收回後逐漸整理，依舊外國工廠較多，卽以紗廠而言，敝團副團長吳伯生君，在靑設有華新紗廠一家，日本人方面則有六家紗廠，從事傾銷，以一敵六，困苦情形，不言而喻。幸靑地工友，咸具有愛國心，前年外國工廠罷工至數月之久，中國工廠照常工作，勞資合作，堪禦外侮，希望滬上企業家，赴靑開廠，以作生力軍，而與外商奮鬥，蓋靑島不特風景優美，交通便利，并且所有工人，生活簡單，能耐勞苦，以前紛往東三省謀生，自九一八以後，均已回魯，人浮於事，祇求溫飽，工資之廉，遠勝滬上，黃君之主張，極有見地，願借主人之酒以謝諸君。繼由任士剛君提議賓主方面，均介紹歷史，以作初步之携手，賓的方面，請警堂君將各團員個人經營之事業，逐一說出，被介紹者起立，以便同席之認識。主的方面，推潘仰堯君依次介紹，亦將各人以往之夏歷史，詳細說明，此種辦法，較之互換名刺而略事寒暄者，收效多而頗有趣味。厥後吳伯生君謂辦工廠，不應專從謀利着想，應發菩提心，俾苦同胞均有飯吃，僉謂此卽佛家所謂無我相，果能如此，卽可同登彼岸，以佛地而說佛語，卽景生情，皆大歡喜。</p>
<h3>端節和國貨</h3>
<p>— 張彰</p>
<p>端節到了，眞的，年年的端節，再過一天，又要來臨了！在端節的前後幾天，咱們中國人的俗禮，是有相互送禮這一回事的，本來這種俗禮，在明白人眼光中看來，固然是應該剷除，應該廢止，可是，在一般人的腦海中，似乎還牢牢的不肯打破，尤其是一般主持家政的主婦們，更是不容易剷除，不容易革掉，這眞是一件浪費的事情！我們减在國民經濟的立塲上看來，當然認爲是不合理的，可是，我們如果站在國貨的推銷方面的立塲上看來，倒是國貨推銷的一個絶好的機會，絶好的時機，只要主婦們能明白提倡國貨，購用國貨的重要，明白提倡國貨，購用國貨，是主婦的天職而努力起來實行的話，那末，端節這一天，我們大可以稱牠爲國貨節，這眞是主婦們，國貨界的日人，所應該共同起來注意的一個問題。</p>
<p>主婦在端節裏，怎樣來提倡國貨，購用國貨呢？我的意見，有下面數項：</p>
<p>（一）送國貨的禮物在端節贈送禮物，我認爲可省則省，如必不可省時，那末，贈送禮物，給親戚朋友，應以購買國貨爲目標，同時，購買的時候，必定要到靠得住的國貨工廠，和國貨公司裏去，那才不致受枉，上當，否則，奸商們的欺騙手段，是層出不窮的，說不定我們要受那改頭換面的仇貨的欺騙呀！</p>
<p>（二）受國貨的禮物贈送禮物的意義，不過是表示親戚友朋間的情感而已！可是，進一步還有提倡國貨的意義在裏，所以，在送禮物的人，固然要購買國貨，來贈送給親戚朋友，可是，在受禮物的一方面，尤其要注意送來的禮物，是不是國貨？假如是國貨的話，那末，可謝了幾聲，收受下來，假如不是國貨的話，我們可以回他一條紙條，說明所以不受的理由，能如此，大家都能如此，那末，送非國貨禮物的人，下次一定不會再去買外貨來送人了，這個效力，實在是偉大得很，我很希望，全中國的智識階級，大家來實行這個方法，貫澈這個主張，於國貨運動的前途，和國貨推銷的進行，實有偉大的帮助。</p>
<p>唉！端節，眞是一個國貨推銷的好機會，我很希望大家來共同注意這個問題，替國貨推銷，多一條出路，多一個生機。</p>
<h3>「日貨到處碰壁」的感想</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>「日貨」，「日貨」，這一個可痛可怖的名詞，自然凡是我們稍具有些血性的國人，無論在報紙上看到了，或是從親友談話中聽到了，總是要立起，種憤怒的態度，和仇視心理的，此無他，不過因爲他對於我們的惡感，是已有了很深切歷史的證明，很能肯定的認他是一種最毒的蛇蝎，假如它的擾動，實的猖獗，都在在足以危害我們社會經濟的崩潰，國計民生的安定，而關於這怪物平日間的行動，格外引起我們的重視，和十二分的注意吧了·</p>
<p>在最近，我們於報紙上，又看到了「日貨到處碰壁」的一個極題，原來他的内容是這樣：「埃及國因鑒於近來日貨傾銷的劇烈，以最堅决的態度，特命駐神户領事候其氏向東京外務省抗議，意欲調整日方之片面貿易，而同時駐神户海地國領事哥爾日氏，也通告大版工商會議所，務　日商購買該國出品，以調整雙方貿易之均衡，否則，海國卽將禁止日貨進口，態度尤爲堅硬，還有牙買加與英國其他屬地，也無不紛紛增加關稅，取締日棉織品進口，表示一致行動云」，從這裏，我們就可更深切地看利日貨傾銷於，世界市塲的猛烈，但，前幾個月聽見的二十七國抵制日貨運動，和現在「日貨到處碰壁」的消息，却也眞是他最嚴重的報復。</p>
<p>不過，在這裏，我們却又得三個很深切的感想，原來，世界各國究竟是不好侵犯的，他們誰也不甘受抵戰意味之傾銷的突擊，而早紛紛提高關稅，匯兌管理，輸入限制，施行傾銷稅等，以作最强有力的制裁，而反顧我國，仇貨的充斥，却依然如故，據昨天報載四月份的中日貿易中，日貨進口只有較三月份更有激增的趨勢，他們是堅築了高硬的壁壘，使日貨到處碰壁，但我們却正如水銀瀉地，仇貨的滾來，是無孔不入，致國貨工業，更受威脅，而永遠地透不出一口氣來，這是什麽原因？正是一個「可痛之謎」！</p>
<h3>一週間國貨新訊</h3>
<p>（一）實業部長陳公博，在南洋考察實業，業已返國，此行對於推銷國貨，極有成績。</p>
<p>（二）山東國貨推銷會，議决强制推銷國貨，函市府限各商於三個月内肅淸外貨，專售國貨，以外貨冒充國貨者，按價倍罰。</p>
<p>（三）中國華絲，在美國交易所正式開拍。</p>
<p>（四）長沙·鄭州·南京·廣州各地中國貨公司，均已籌備將竣，約在二個月内行後開幕。</p>
<p>（五）廣東統制糖業計畫，已由省政府核准公布。</p>
<p>（六）國際貿易局，介紹國產水果向海外推銷，頗有成績。</p>
<p>（七）北平鐵展會開幕半月，國貨售品，已達十八萬四千元。</p>

<p>（十）松江國貨展覧會於六月十日開幕。</p>
<p>總之，在現階段，日貨的傾銷，已到任心般深刻化，並且，它在世界市塲上遇到碰壁後，其結果，必的量將他危機的損失，揀擇最易侵襲的中國，而儘量轉嫁，自然，它此後的對華傾銷，將更跟着視綫而集中，那麽，我全國的同胞們，爲未雨綢繆計，對此嚴重之問題，將怎樣地去步各國後塵，作一度最有效的制裁呢！</p>
<p>短訊盆湯弄大馬路口天祿鞋莊，爲上海唯一著名鞋店，設置完備，爲該業冠，式樣不拘新古，統有出售，現値該號舉行减價期間，所有國產原料各鞋，本提倡國貨之熱忱，特别削碼，以示提倡。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在滿淸帝國未覆亡之前，穿衣服也有一定的法令制定着的，所有一切官吏，命婦，都得服從。但是這些法令倒也並不如何不近人情，祇是照着春夏秋冬四季的分别，規定各式不同的衣服罷了。而每個季節又用一種花來代表。在冬季裏，用的是黃色的臘梅花；在春季裏，用的是牡丹花；在夏季裏，用的是荷花；在秋季裏，用的是菊花。所有宮裏面的各位女官，和宮外的那些朝臣的妻子們，每一季所穿的衣服上，如果要繡花的話，就得繡代表這一季的花。譬如春天，必須繡特丹花，否則不但不合時式，還得領一個抗旨的罪名咧！</p>
<p>除掉衣服上的花飾之外，衣服的式樣，也是因着季候的不同：而分别規定着的。譬如到了冬季，雖然都須穿皮衣服，但有時候只要穿出鋒的皮衣，有時候却須穿全部襯着皮的皮衣：便是皮的種類，也不是一律的。規定的共有四種，都是依着天氣的寒煖而更換的，這四種皮是：銀鼠，灰鼠，狐，紫貂。</p>
<p>一到冬季的開始，皇太后就得布一道詔書下去，普通總是在隔夜發出去的；這一道詔書上，大約是說「自翌日起，應各服裘。」當然，這詔書的内容决不如此簡單，照例還有洋洋一大篇的官樣文章，可是綜合起來，總不出這兩句話的意思。所以每一個朝臣，大槪都有很多的衣服藏着；因爲待到太后的手詔一下去，明天上朝的時候，他們無論如何，就得把皮衣服穿起來了。倘平時不端整好，臨時那裏來得及呢！（五七）</p>
<h3>所謂科學靈乩</h3>
<p>— 羅二</p>
<p>幾位男女親戚朋友聚在一塊，討論科學靈乩。</p>
<p>余太太因爲懷念伊的已死的姪兒，想求碟仙召他的靈魂來談談，尤其是想他將臨死的時候欲和伊談的話說出來。</p>
<p>魯二先生很鄭重地說了一件碟仙靈蹟的新聞，神乎其神！</p>
<p>「有一位同事曾經祈問碟仙第五期航空獎券頭彩的號碼，結果彩的號碼，結果得了末尾一個五字的回答。開獎以後，這位同事雖不中，亦小進財，因爲他得了不少末一和末二同獎。你說不靈，這又是這麽一因事！」</p>
<p>方大先生聽完了這一番話，連連地喊道：「還有我的一位同學，那更是奇怪。他請碟仙召一位活朋友談話。等到談話完畢，他宣佈請的是活人，大家不由地一陣喧笑那時際碟仙忽地一跳丈把高，重重地打了他的腦袋一下。你們說吧！」</p>
<p>余太太圓睜兩眼，不斷地喊着：「嘖！嘖！嘖！靈呀！好靈的大仙呀！該打！打得好！」</p>
<p>「寗可信其有，不可信其無。」魯二先生連點腦袋，打着土白說。</p>
<p>方大先生最是好奇。第二天買了一付靈乩，在客堂間裏，求仙，請神，召魂，至誠可感天地。</p>
<p>三隻不同形式的手指，緊緊地按住碟仙的屁股。一等五分鐘，不動，二等十分鐘，不動，三等一刻鐘，不動。六隻眼睛漸漸地轉紅，三隻手指像在顫動，但是碟仙的身子被按僵了。</p>
<p>吧！無！璫瑯瑯！瑯瑯！碟仙一怒，忽地身躍一丈多高，投在痰孟裏而亡。</p>
<p>這纔聽見方大先生氣虎虎地駡道：「該死該死，尋老子開心！」</p>
<h3>逆子讀孝經</h3>
<p>— 淸</p>
<p>阜寗縣長李晋芳，是江蘇省以第一名考取的縣長，自出長阜寗以來，政績很是不錯。昨天，有個阜寗的朋友李君，告訴我李縣長處罰逆子事，很饒興趣，特記之如次：</p>
<p>阜寗縣東城，有個董ＸＸ，曾在敎育界服務，總算是個知識份子。但是他有一種壞處，就是不孝父母，對於他的父親，任意侮辱，信口謾駡，他父親祇有一個兒子，所以並不和他計較。那知道他竟得步進步，和他父親索起債來，大槪是去年吧！他寫了一封信給他父親，上欵是ＸＸ見字：（他父親的名號）下欵則署大太爺手書，内容是有錢趕速淸償，否則應書一欠據。如將來無力償還時，則來生須變驢馬，以償大太爺的欠欵。當時他父親非常震怒，立向李縣長處，告他忤逆李縣長是以保存舊道德爲宗旨的，聽見這事，就把他抓了來，押在監獄裏。並且買了一部孝經，給董ＸＸ誦讀，一直等到他悔悟以後，纔把他釋放出來，聽說他對他父親，已經不像從前那樣了！</p>
<p>各地的逆子多着呢！如果能全是這樣的處治一下，倒也是一件大快人心的事啊！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十回　目送哀鴻埋頭守國土　彈穿勁臂灑血染孤城</p>
<p>這時他得着營長的命令，加築寨子，南門外的防禦工事。在這南門外頭，本來已經有了兩道暫壕。　芳總怕敵人的唐克車，不容易抵抗，所以又命令自强，帶了他自已一連弟兄，在南門外再挖一道乾壕，壕上堆着樹枝鹿岔以便擋住敵人。自强站在土坡上，向下面看着弟兄們挖壕，偶然一抬頭，却看到本寨了裏的老百姓扶老携幼向進口子的路上走。自已所託的那位老百姓，也在其中慢慢的走着。他似乎也看到自强站在坡上來注意着他，因之在懷裏一摸，摸出一封信來，向前面連連揮了幾下，看他那意思，好像是表示，他凖可以把這封信帶到。自强沒有别的話說的只是遙遙的望着他。因爲他要抬起手來有什麽表示的話，就會讓弟兄們看到。覺得自已不能專心軍事，還要思念着家庭，這是一種惰性，所以並不動作，只把眼睛來看住也好像是並不知道有這件事一般，那些在坡下工作的弟兄們，都靜等着連長來指揮。現在見連長只管向回南的路上呆望，也許是看了向前走的老百姓，有些想家吧？因爲如此，向外搬土的，手捧了糞箕，不知道倒下去，也向前望着。在坡下用鋤頭挖土的，雖是看不到上面，却也手扶了鋤頭，昻着腦袋，向坡上望着。一個如此，全體都不免停止了工作。自强偶然回頭，看到大家這副情形，心裏想着，這可了不得，偶然五分鐘的忍略，幾乎全體怠工了。於是也不責問弟兄們，自已跳下坡去，拿過一柄鋤頭，高高舉起，就挖起十來。（四○八）</p>
<h3>賣油條的小孩子</h3>
<p>— 連城</p>
<p>還是那樣的黝黑的時候，，就有一種很悽慘的「油條啊！油條啊！油條啊！」的聲音，從一個小孩子的口中發出來。這種聲音，直到日上三竿，少爺小姐們起身的時候，才烟消雲散的沒有了。差不多一年以來，不論寒暑，不論晴雨，都是這樣的。</p>
<p>我當每次聽到這種聲音的時候，總是下意識的駡着：「自已不要睡眠，爲什麽要防碍人家的睡眠呢？」</p>
<p>雖然，我是恨極了他，但當他呌着的時候，總沒有勇氣去制止他。</p>
<p>近幾天來，忽然不聽見這種聲音了。自喜以後可以安安穏穏的睡覺，眞是得其所哉。可是天下事，總是出乎意料以外的，才自喜睡眠的障碍！「油條啊！油條啊！」的聲音是沒有了，不知怎樣又來了一種妨礙睡眠的聲音。但是這種聲音，與從前比擬起來，更是悽慘了，更是難聽了。從前是小孩的聲音，現在是婦人的聲音，從前是「油條啊！油條啊！的呌賣聲，現在是「我的兒，我的肉」的哭聲。</p>
<p>啊！我聽够了，我聽够了還是掉換原來的聲音吧！但是啊！那小孩再也不呌了。</p>
<p>術蹤所至</p>
<h3>南遊拾零福州市街景</h3>
<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>福州是華南的名都，那邊有十幾里路的長街，長街兩旁滿是現代式的建築物，商市中用以招徠顧客的播音機終日哼着流行的閩曲，省會官員們用以經濟時間縮减距離的汽車在平直的水泥道上奔突着，角聲隨處可聞，合併都市特有的煩喧而成現代的交響。女人，也是不甘落後的，服飾的式樣眞趕得上先進的上海，而風度與體態都帶着南國味的。但是福州可眞像一般想像的那麽繁榮嗎？不不，這龐大的城市並不曾逃出普遍的經濟恐慌的網圈，不景氣的衰亡的面幕早與許多别個城市同樣蒙罩了。</p>
<p>到過福州的人該會知道吧，福州的繁榮是單純地植基於商業經濟上，市民消費的機會多，生產的機會少，雖然馬路上儘多着赤脚的勞働婦女，但是這不够將多數肚皮的飢餓隠蔽的。社會上的許多罪惡是由貧困造成的，傍晚的公園裏固不乏善良女人的閒步，但是與此同樣，通明的電炬光裏粉臉女正尋覓着伊一家人的命運。飢餓的威力已敎伊們低頭無奈了，一陣失望襲來的時候，伊們那裏敢於悲嗚呢？祇有把疲弱的視綫投向士敏土做成了的頭，因爲祇有士敏土的頭是知道伊們的。</p>
<p>異國的語言</p>
<p>「女息奔嗎？息鬼碗？阿腮阿腮，阿綠阿綠」。眞够要命呵，這福州的語言。不但福州，全福建的語言，都是像異國人的話，聽見了眞够你像腦筋呢。</p>
<p>初到福州的人丨就使住了相當久的人，那一個不感有言語不通的苦處呢？就如你要雇一輛車，「車子車子」的呼聲呌得震天價響，而車夫却是如無所聞的，有的甚至呆望着你，以爲你在發什麽瘋癲病。買東西，問路······還不都是一樣地費勁嗎？但是費勁還不是徒然嗎？對方是絶不會了解你的言語的意思，也正如你不能了解對方一樣。朋友對我說：「外國言語聽不懂我們也還甘心，但是中國人聽不懂中國人的話，這是不近情理而且說不過去的呵」。但是不近情理的事情儘有着，並且儘多着，這難道不是我們自國的莫大恥辱嗎？</p>
<p>從前聽見别人說福建語言像烏呌，我們未敢置信，因爲照想像，福建的語言至多也如北方話和上海話的差别似的，腔雖不同，而字眼的發音祇差得半個，而說出來多少是有點相像的。但是返顧吃飯呌「息奔」，是是呌「阿腮阿腮」，比到全國通用的普通話相差何止千萬理呵，說這是異國的語言想不致過分吧。</p>
<p>但是這種異國的言語似的閩語還該讓它永遠存在下去嗎？</p>
<p>定光塔</p>
<p>在福州的任何平曠的原野向城廂望，祇要前面沒有足以障礙視綫的高大建築或密林，那麽，你准會瞧着在雜色的房屋的瓦蓋所織成的深奥之巨痕中，有兩條挺直的烟柱突出在空裏，好像站立在鷄羣當中的鸛鶴，一條是白的，一條是黑的。黑的雖然同樣刺着遊衆的眼睛，但在談話間，記憶裏，常是被人所遺漏，白的是高傲的，跟白衣大士一樣，常常掛在人的嘴唇上，這便是這裏要說的定光塔了。</p>
<p>大甲蟲似的于山上，豎了許多古碑，巖石上，刻了紀念戚繼光的詩詞，從山上俯首看下去是禪房深幽的白塔寺，但是隨着構築招起頭來看，你便瞧見了定光塔的雄姿。</p>
<p>老僧在塔門向遊客討幾個銅板的進塔錢進塔是異常黝暗的，循着盤旋的樓梯上去，從一層到七層，牆上繪了慈祥的佛像，寫着名流的題字，但是「Ｘ月Ｘ日余與妻來上一游」的無聊話語也夾雜其間，更有的是歪詩「高山有好水，平地有好花」等句，大好的勝地被俗客玷汚了。但是白塔之雄姿依然高傲地在混水似的潭城廂裏轟立着。</p>
<p>塔的外緣，每層都有石闌，是供人憑眺的，在那裏可以俯瞰全城的風物。異敎堂裏的聖處女在低頭漫步着，擊球的姑娘劃出了輕盈的笑聲。</p>
<p>白塔的扶梯是三面凌空，盤旋以達於頂，可說科學已極，但是談者嘴上掛着的祇有蘇俄的什麽大厦，美洲的什麽高樓，自國的建築的偉大從來就被人忽略的，這是多够人的呌屈而慨嘆呢。</p>

<h3>玩具</h3>
<p>— 宓子章</p>
<p>今年是兒童年。我記得的，所以時常看看造給兒童的玩具。</p>
<p>馬路旁邊的洋貨店裏掛着零星小物件，紙上標明，是從法國運來的，但我在日本的玩具店看見一樣的貨色，只是價錢更便宜。在擔子上，在小攤上，都賣着漸吹漸大的橡皮泡，上面打着一個印字道：「完全國貨」，可見是中國自已製造的了。然而日本孩子玩着的橡皮泡上，也有同樣的印子，那却應該是他們自已製造的。</p>
<p>大公司裏則有武器的玩具；指揮刀，機關槍，坦克車······。然而，雖是有錢人家的小孩，拿着玩的也少見。公園裏面，外國孩子聚沙成爲圓堆，橫挿上兩條短樹幹，這明明是在創造鐵甲砲車了，而中國孩子是靑白的，瘦瘦的臉，躱在大人背後，羞怯的，驚異的看着，身上穿着一件斯文之極的長衫。</p>
<p>我們中國是大人用的玩具多，姨太太，雅片槍，麻雀牌，毛毛雨，科學靈乩，金剛法會，還有别的，忙個不了，沒有工夫想到孩子身上去了。雖是兒童年，雖是前年身歷了戰禍，也沒有因此給兒童創出一種紀念的小玩意，一切都是照樣抄。然則明年不是兒童年了，那情形就可想。</p>
<p>但是，江北人却是製造玩具的天才。他們用兩個長短不同的竹筒，染成紅綠，連作一排，筒内藏一個彈簧，旁邊有一個把手，搖起來就格格的響。這就是機關槍！也是我所見的惟一的創作。我在租界邊上買了一個，和孩子搖着在路上走，文明的西洋人和勝利的日本人看見了，大抵投給我們一個鄙夷或悲憫的苦笑。</p>
<p>然而我們搖着在路上走，毫不愧恧，因爲這是創作。前年以來，很有些人駡着江北人，好像非此不足以自顯其高潔，現在沈默了，那高潔也就渺渺然，茫茫然。而江北人却創造了粗笨的機關槍玩具，以堅强的自信和質樸的才能與文明的玩具爭。他們，我以爲是比從外國買了極新式的武器回來的人物，更其値得讚頌的，雖然也許又有人會因此給我一個鄙夷或悲憫的冷笑。</p>
<h3>北山與廟會</h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>丨吉林雜寫之二丨</p>
<p>說起北山，都可以說是吉林風景絶佳的地方。山不大，也不太高，躺在城外西北角上。山上有濃蔭蔽日的高樹，有零亂錯雜的矮林，有碧綠如茵的草坪，同時還映襯着紅黃相兼的沙路與列石。還有匠人雕畫的殿台，但又不乏鄕村野老隨意搭成的茅棚草舍。山後坡，有幾座傾斜的塔頂，緊依着洋化工程的自來水池，好似故意表明它們自身是東西兩洋文化的代表者。沙石路，彎彎曲曲，從山下沒入山上，路旁陳設着大小的茶棚與書塲。羊腸小路，也有好幾條。當夏秋李節，日落垂暮的時候，一般人們爲的想要吐一吐城市中的悶氣，修養一下精神，總是來到北山游玩的。在山上，一邊聽着廟裏的鐘聲，一面享受傍晚的凉風的吹拂，再遠眺松花江上漸起漸濃的霧氣，和西半天上反映出的紅霞，是别有一種輕快之感。</p>
<p>山下面，平舖着一大片平地，平地邊上緊依着一片淸澈見底的池水，水裏點染着一叢叢的綠蒲與水草。一座石橋從水上爬過去，這是往來城裏山間的要道。垂楊到處都有，總是喜歡隨着風勢弄皺了池水。吉海鐵路，沿着水邊，靠着山根，曲折地從東北竄到西南去。因此，這風景絶佳的山水，平原，常常撒上一團一團的機關車的煤烟。</p>
<p>每年，北山都有一次廟會的，廟會的盛况，只要是省裏人沒有不知道的。廟會日是舊曆四月二十八日，這是「正日」，再加上二十七，二十九兩個「副日」，一共有三天。</p>
<p>每逢廟會前幾天，鐵路局就要加開車輛，而且票價還要打着折扣，多麽難得的機會！外鄕的農民們，爲的討便宜，爲的要到省城裏逛逛景緻，還有的人爲得要到廟上燒香還願，到這時，寗肯犧牲幾天田裏的工作，都願意藉此玩上幾天的。</p>
<p>說到廟會本身，其實是使人耗財曠時的舉動。除了當時有些臨時市塲添設出來，一些大小商店趁此作着生意外，再有的事情，就是燒香。所有遊山趕會的人，多多少少總要化上幾個錢。</p>
<p>雖說廟會是一年一次，但是一九三二年，却破例地由省城行政當局通令停止，原因是地方不靖，丨丨吉林城四外潛伏的義勇軍，隨時都有攻入省城的可能，廟會因之遭到了厄運。說實在話，那一時，人們眞沒有逛廟趕會的心情：住城的旣然恐慌不安，鄕裏人也都是過着「明天死活未卜」的日子，這又可說是大動亂给代與的恩賜。</p>
<p>但是一九三三年情形就不同了。因爲日本的兵力，把義勇軍略爲鎭住。於是，這一年的廟會，特别提倡興辦，成爲「恊合會」宣傳「王道主義」的工具。藉廟會來作政治上的宣傳，恐怕是北山有廟會以來的第一次吧。</p>
<p>所謂藉廟會宣傳，簡單得令人聞之欲笑。只是藉重日本飛機，在天空上向山上山下一帶地上亂撒一些傳單，標語而已。這裏就是一張字跡最少的傳單：「新國之賜」金戈定得太平春新國雨露澤人民行看哪百工如林起生活得營錦衣玉食辭却貧</p>
<p>這可是有意掩埋事實，故意欺騙百姓。事實上，東北還是沒有一塊稱得上是太平的地方，錦衣，玉食，也許鄭孝胥，熙洽一流人得到了，一般老百姓，多是弄得失家失業，米飯布衣猶患不足，玉食錦衣談何敢！</p>
<p>一九三四年舊歷四月二十八日又過去了，但不知這一回的廟會是否舉行？如果舉行了，是否又有别的新花樣。想來，總不至停止的，因爲他們不是可以藉此再來一次王道主義的宣傳麽。</p>
<h3>六月的夜</h3>
<p>— 雨果作穆木天譯</p>
<p>夏天，在白晝逝去的時節，在遠處：雜花絢爛的平原散出醉人的薫香：眼睛閉着，耳朶，半啓着，聽着喧　，人只是在透明的睡眠中半睡着。</p>
<p>星光是更純潔，陰影像是更好；　　漫淡的薄明塗上了永刧的穹窿；</p>
<p>而溫和且蒼白的黎明，在等待着他的時間，好像整夜裏，在天空下邊彷徨着。</p>
<h3>第三個娜娜</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>電影把娜娜變成茶花女，並不是一個很拙劣的手法。娜娜的確是從茶花女脫化出來的，稱娜娜爲第二個馬格萊脫，或稱馬格萊脫爲第一個娜娜，都未常不可。她們都是被踐踏的女人，馬格萊脫對於踐踏她的男子，並不比娜娜更少了解。但馬格萊脫還夢想眞純的戀愛丨丨其實這在娜娜也多少還有丨丨崇高的犧牲，所以她受了雙重的踐踏。無論她對大呂班先生是怎樣地至死敬愛，她所受的呂班這一類的人的踐踏，並不比從他所憎惡的人受來的爲少。</p>
<p>娜娜就再不相信高貴的人的聖潔了，她雖然同樣得到純眞的靑年的熱愛，但她只怕這或者是一種罪孽，而並不覺這可以引入一種理想。她脫出這一種踐踏，而對於另一重踐踏，也有了更勇敢的對付，她受着男子的踐踏，同時却也踐踏男子。肉體與金錢的蹂躪，都只是細節，她的重大成功，是使人知道在所謂沒有靈魂的女子之外，更有同樣沒有靈魂的男人。</p>
<p>我不敢斷說左拉稱娜娜爲毒菌是什麽意思。自然更不知道他，是否在想應該撲滅，及打算如何撲滅。雖然文學家多數是預言家，左拉到底離另一種社會還遠。我們現在和十九世紀初還差不了多少，多數人還想把馬格萊脫的夢再纒住娜娜，則娜娜得救，而社會也得救。電影的娜娜，就是在這種心理下產生。</p>
<p>然而現社會裏，也就有了鄧肯那樣的女子。忽視鄧肯的藝術的人，大槪不會把鄧肯比娜娜看得高上多少。在鄧肯生涯中的男人，事實上怕也沒有鄧肯筆下寫出的那樣可愛。哥登格雷要她在家爲他削鉛筆，也就不是一個並不尋常的男子。至於那個大闊老的羅鴻林，無論如何，總不免是使人不舒服的人物。也許是鄧肯太偉大，也許是她太軟弱，她不曾像娜娜樣地控制男子。</p>
<p>可是現社會裏還只有娜娜可以不太吃虧。在社會上還殘留不少踐踏女人的男人時，終會產生同樣多的踐踏男人的女人。這女人將不是一個單純的娜娜，而將是加有鄧肯的理想的娜娜，第三個娜娜，而她也未必仍是毒菌。</p>

<p>（九）「二酉委譚」中，尙有一則，亦甚佳，並錄於此。其文云：「余性不耐冠帶，暑月猶甚。豫章喜早熱，而今歲尤甚。春三月十七日，觴客於滕王閣，日出如火，流汗接踵，頭涔涔幾不知歸，而發狂大呌。婦爲具湯沐，便科頭裸身赴之。時西山雲霧，新茗初至，張右伯適以見遺。茶色白大，作荳子香，幾與虎丘埒。余時浴出，露坐明月下，亟命侍兒汲新水煮嘗之，覺沆　入咽，兩腋風生。念此境味，都非宦路所有。琳泉蔡先生老而嗜茶，猶甚於予。時已就寢，不可呼之共啜。晨起復烹遺之，然已作第二義矣。追憶夜來風味，書一通贈生生。」所謂「淸淡雋永」，此文可謂有之。</p>
<p>（十）胡應麟「甲乙剩言」中，也很有幾則可誦的，如「王太僕」等篇。抒情之計，祇有「李惟寅」一條。其言曰：「李惟寅太保，别僅一再易凉暑耳，遂不良於行。蹣跚出客，道故殷勤，至涕落不能止。因念走馬長干，鍾陵躍澗時，何輕捷也？而一旦衰憊爾爾，乃知人生壯盛，足恃幾何，不覺覧鏡，亦爲　絲興歏。」此類短小的抒情文，在「寳顏堂秘笈」等書中，甚是不少，而「百家小說」則不多，想係爲編者删却耳。</p>
<p>跋右隨筆十則，讀「皇明百家小說」時之雜記也。當讀畢時，靈鳳爲「萬歲」素稿，曾取其冷刺熱諷的部份，成「明朝的笑話」一篇予之。最近，再閱全書，仍有不能已於記者，因再成此篇。在百家小說之中，其系統而優秀，爲我所愛讀的，尙有寫倪雲林生活之顧元慶的「雲林遺事」，追懷故去友人們往事之張鴻磐的「西州合譜」，寫地方景物生活之費元祿的「嚣采淸課」紀鬼怪艷遇之陸燦的「洞簫記」，但篇幅較長，祇有收入個人秘笈矣。至涉及文網禁書等事者，當别錄之。</p>
<h3>火災（八）</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>當天的下午，我從姑丈，張君和朋友們處得到一點旅費，乘着擁擠着的汽車，逆了我的原意重回棉蘭。這時，我只帶着穿在身上的一身衣服，别的統統理葬在火裏。呵，可憐珍貴着的上些費了許多精神，時間和金錢收集得來的文件和照片，是完全喪失了，這在我是怎樣傷心啊！</p>
<p>在棉蘭，整理了我的幻滅的心，和疲倦的身體，又重新購備了旅具，從朋友處再借了些錢懊喪地歸國了。回國後，我把詳細的經過報告某校校長和書店裏的編輯先生。他們除了悼惜之外，倒安慰我好幾句。</p>
<p>回國後一個月，我接到一封張君從新加坡寄來的信：「一月十日之災，君不幸乃同罹浩刦，運何丕哉！當夜風勢之猛，火勢之烈，思之猶覺心悸！先父五十載慘淡經營之基業，至乃廢於一旦，豈不痛哉！幸廣隆號東許佑文先生，爲家父盟兄弟，雖對之淺於世故，薄</p>
<p>訓；然尙千方設法，將來或當另建爐　，必不爲人謀所傷也。惟根基旣頽，今萬非昔比矣，聞此次火災，雖火起於敝店，而其火源實屬令姑丈·········僑界間現頗有煩言，而居留政府現亦偵騎四出，恐不日當水落石出也。」</p>
<p>對於這封信，雖曾一時惹起我心裏的不安；後來因爲奔走生活，也便漸漸地记忘却了。突然八個月後，又接到姑丈從廣東原籍裏寄來一封信，内面附着一張滙票。信裏說：「年初姪之南渡，寄宿敝店者祇一日，乃命途何蹇，竟分受祝融之災，余深爲姪嘆也！嗣後余遍受訓謗，埠人士乃多以火災之責，加余身上。更有甚者，新加坡廣隆號因其在本埠福和號之債務不少，無法收回，不思火由福和而起，乃竟敎唆張姓小子，聯絡僑界中不識不知之輩，控余以生意頽敗，故意縱火，以圖救濟經濟危機，月圖收受保險金之罪。余姪乎，余一生淸白，豈能忍受此不白之寃？故延律師爲文辯訴。此時保險公司亦派探偵查，多方諜訊。幸埠中少數明達公允之士，羣爲余助，以余數項淸晰，存欠相抵有餘，固無須爲此卑下忍毒之計也。甲必丹（十四）爲我僑之長，職責攸關，勢當莫能緘默。彼明達士也，故力辯余寃。於是涉訟半載之寃案，終且得白；今余且已領取保險金矣。除以八十千還債，十千費於訟費外，尙餘銀一萬盾。念余一生寄跡洋邦，備嘗艱苦。今老矣，當退隠鄕梓，藉薄田以終余天年也。聞姪行李一箱，中多文件影像諸品，彼時未能搶出，至以爲憾！今寄上匯票一千元，希向海上銀行收領，以償所失。則前事只値一晒，而姪可不損分毫矣！」</p>
<p>這封信使我怏怏了好幾天！千元的欵項固然可以暫時救我生許之急，然而那些珍貴的文件和照片所費去的精神或時間，豈是一千元的金錢所能補償麽？并且，幸而我尙能收回我的一點損失費，而那些無產的店夥和工人們，應該依靠那個地方爲生的；或者雖有點薄產而破失了他們的定，失了他自父祖們所遺下來的生活的根據的僑胞們，他們除了白受寃枉的災禍之外，要用什麽别的方法繼續生活下去呢？</p>
<p>（註十四）殖民地政府除利用酋長幚助他們洽理土人之外，在華人方面，又設着馬腰，甲必丹等幾個官銜幚着他們管理華人。至於甲必丹的權限在法律上不很明晰；自然在政治上完全無力，而在管理華僑的稅收和糾紛上，却大有用處的。（完）</p>
<h3>關於「開離了馬來亞的海岸綫」</h3>
<p>本刋於二日發表新詩「離開了馬來亞的海岸綫」後，三日卽有流氷君來館，親交一函，略謂「······那篇詩是鄙人所作，已於今年一月發表於中國詩歌會主編的「新詩歌」第五期中。（現在特將該刋寄上一閱，）不想到現在，竟有人「明火打刦」，將拙作增减了幾個字，改過了所謂「秋濤」先生自已的大名，更敢投到數萬觀衆的自由談發表（中略）。現在，鄙人爲文責關係，恐怕引起各方的誤會，不得不通知先生，並懇先生自由談中，將這封信公開」</p>
<p>編者正在設法調查此事眞相之時，乃有人已在别種報紙公開揭發，故不得不將流冰君來函，節刋如右。並依本報慣例，聲明取銷稿酬資。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>取締婦女奇裝異服</h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>確實的，近年來婦女的裝束之標奇立異，差不多是到了難以形容的境地，時而膀膊畢露，倐爾粉腿悉陳、已極時髦摩登之能事。時裝企業家曁新裝公司倡導號召乎上，無數小姐奶奶由而趨競之，一唱一和，蔚然而成這一花花綠綠的大觀！旣然婦女裝束已經風靡一時的孳求於「盡態極研」的考究，勢必違乎「衣以護體」的主旨，流於令人肉麻的現象，所謂「炫奇鬥巧，不但妨害衛生，而且有傷風化」者正是。</p>
<p>本來這一風氣是隨社會之日簿崦嵫，人們之企求肉的享樂以忘掉現實而日益滋長，絶非衛道者慨嘆之「世風日下人心不古」有以所致。因此牠的消滅已不是局部的「風化」事態，而成爲，與之密相連繫的整個社會問題，我們看以儉樸爲宗旨的新生活運動雖風湧全國，但是一點也沒有影響到太太小們愛漂亮的心，奇裝異服之依然甚熾，便爲顯明的實例。可是現在爲政者亦注意到奇裝異服之傷風化礙衛生，而有取締之舉，究竟與不規則的摩登破壞團更有絶大的功德，足爲此刻摩登婦女的當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>據報載，江西省政府奉蔣委員長手令，業已訂定取締奇裝異服辦法，令飭省令公安局及關係各廳會知照，旗袍最長須離脚背一寸，衣領最高須離顎骨一寸半，袖長最短須齊肘關節，開叉不得過膝蓋以上三寸······等，先從女公務員女學生公務員家屬起實行，再推行其他各地各界婦女，婦女衣着不遵守本辦法者，由崗警加以干涉，如有反抗，得拘局懲處云云。同樣的禁令，在不久前見之於魯省當局，據傳廣西更加雷厲風行，女學生不僅崇尙簡樸，且以養成當看護服工役爲美德。</p>
<p>婦女裝束之「炫奇鬥巧」，讓那些唯美主義先生們去譽爲社會文明的表現罷，我們若稍微仔細的考審牠所表示的社會美意，則其結論不能不是「國家將亡，必有妖孽」。不過是女子主觀的要這樣趨時髦尙摩登麽？又確乎未必。中國目前是整個國民經濟破產動盪騒亂的社會，而在這破產動亂的過程中，則又分成兩個絶相懸殊的階級。上之是養尊履厚驕奢淫佚的生活，一雙結婚皮鞋花去幾百番，洗澡一次牛奶數桶，毫不爲奇，至於無數打入飢餓羣中的婦女，一方是極端貧困使能够「成家立業」的男子减少，坤象過剩，一方面則因這許多婦女感於經濟的壓迫而被提到人肉市塲來，供一般「色情狂」的去洩慾。前者爲要爭奪「三大兩小」的專房寵幸，後者爲要將貨色打扮得以廣招來，於是便一肌一容盡態極妍，此婦女奇裝異服之所由風靡也。</p>
<p>所以欲求婦女奇裝異服　取締禁絶，首先得根本消滅婦女用此以取媚逢迎男子的心理，欲求婦女這一心理的除去，則賴乎事先將造成婦女縱慾离享樂和肉體拍賣的社會基因與以廢止。</p>
<h3>送行</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>黑暗的夜空，黑暗的都會，黑暗的人的臉龐，······總之，一切都黑暗化，一切，都被黑暗包圍着。</p>
<p>在這黑暗的環境裏，鐵不幸被送到了一個不著名的醫院了，苦楚，自然是不能避免的，在焦灼，煩悶，交攻得使他難以持忍的時候，他覺悟了。他訴說過這一切旣成形態的不合理，他也發願過打算剷除了這當前的障魔；病，逐漸的好了，好了，那深印下來的影子，無論如何，他是不會遺忘的。於此，他曾經預備挖墾這艱苦的工作，但是，無數的魔掌在牽拉着他，威嚇着他，結果，他不能不在雙重的威迫下而退避了。</p>
<p>幾天以後，他給了我這樣的一封信！</p>
<p>！······弟爲女色所誤，身敗名裂，欲待自殺，旣恐遺世人以不齒，復仇雪恨，則又無此等之能力；久停於此，目觸神傷，殊不若離此罪惡之淵藪爲愈也，······現擬於明晚乘輪返里，蓋我鄕縱已破產，但自有其天然之淸趣存在，絶不似都市之專以聲色炫人也······</p>
<p>爲了想留一個握别時最後的會語，在工作完了以後，很早的跑到了他的家。推開門，房裏的秩序很雜亂，鐵的臉上，被一層很勉强的愉快蒙罩着，面對着我，沒有說什麽，只在苦笑着，彷彿想要使人領略這其中的含意是的。</p>
<p>夏初的時候，日間的時間雖已增長，但一轉眼，又上燈了。不知怎麽，在今天，只覺得心在空虚着，電燈也特别的幽暗，到處，都顯示着一種凄凉。</p>
<p>晚飯，擺在六仙的桌上。這次，把所餘留的飯票，更添了幾樣菜，並且，又買了點黃酒，預備澆滅了内心的幽沉。我們對坐着，空氣，非常的肅穆，肅穆，幾乎肅穆得有些怕人，心聲，在淸晣的擊奏着，酒，是慢慢地少了，乾了，沒有鏡子，只覺得臉上有點發燒，眼睛裏，是辣辣地。</p>
<p>鐘，敲過了十下，戰後的閘北，已沉寂得死去了一樣，夜空，那樣的黑暗，沒有繁星，又沒有月華，也沒有流雲，兩輛黃包車在坑坎的石子路上奔跑着，路旁，不見高樓，更不見大厦，那矮矮地，是一羣發着霉臊氣味的茅棚呵！不辦路名，也不必去認識方向，一切，都聽憑他跑去。</p>
<p>拐了好幾個灣了，拉到了一個碼頭。嘿，不錯，碼頭上的燈到怪亮的呢！左側，停靠着一隻船，有幾個人在陸續的爬了上去。江水，多黑喲，拍搭拍搭地，聲音又多脆喲！</p>
<p>買到了一個舖位，把行李攤開了，坐下去，都沒有話說。是的，生離和死别在人生中是最痛楚的，何况是受到絶大的刺激而懷着另一種心情的人呢？我想勸解他，又想安慰他，但，怎樣的開口呢？滿腹的語言，是被阻梗在喉頭，不能透一點兒聲息。</p>
<p>夜，更深了，江上的風從窗口吹進來，使人覺得有些凉意，看看，是將近十二時了。</p>
<p>！再見吧，願你此去珍重，常有信來！</p>
<p>我的聲音有點發抖，他的眼眶，也有點微紅。</p>
<p>不知所以的，我們兩人的手握着了，一陣凉氣，由他的掌心裏一直的傳送過來。</p>
<p>沒有繁星，沒有流雲，沒有月華。一切。都被黑暗籠</p>

<h3>長途</h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>太陽已跌進對面的山凹，一輛重負的兩輪車在長途上推進，前面四個，後面二個，他們從太陽背後升出來的時候，就開始他們的旅程，現在他們的影子已長長地拖在相反的方向了。</p>
<p>除了在中午時候打過尖，他們沒有休息過，推動着這重負的兩輪車一步一步的從這鎭到那鎭；而且終年他們在這遙遠的長途中來往，沒有一天休息，像一天不能不吃飯一樣。</p>
<p>太陽在最後的一瞬間沉沒了，僅僅幾片五彩的雲霞，作最後的掙扎，一天已完了，經過了前面的小橋，就可以望見這鎭上茶館的市招了。</p>
<p>在前一個年紀較大的揮了揮手，其餘五個像在被太陽囇黑了的手腕上增了更大的力量，一聲喲，咿，六條身體努力地和地面成了個銳角形，腿肚上的血管紡紼蚯蚓一般爆綻出來，那輛車終於被拖上了橋面。他們微微地喘了一下氣，粗魯地用手背捋去了額角上的汗珠，繩子從肩上卸下來，六條身體再向後仰，將車輛慢慢的吊下橋面。</p>
<p>隨着傾斜的滑勢，輕鬆地跑了一陣路，那個茶館老關打哈哈的姿勢已站立在他們面前。他們已交卸了一天的責任，車輛停住了之後，六個人跳進茶棚底下，店小二已端了三盆臉水送上來。各人赤了上身洗過了，粗野地圍攏桌來，喝着溫凉了的茶，眞像牯牛飲水一樣，一大缸的茶平均的分配到六個旅人的腹中去了。</p>
<p>這時候是他們一天最愉快的時候，晚幕已經罩上來，夜風吹拂他堅强的身體，彷佛被愛人撫摩着一般舒適。也有微微闔上眼皮，頭斜臥在茶棚的柱子上，幻想他們的家鄕，這該是孩子們捕知了的時候了。</p>
<p>老是打着哈哈的茶館老間，見他們已安適地休息着了，　啣了旱烟袋跑近來，先大聲地笑着說：</p>
<p>「伙計們，做些什麽吃？」</p>
<p>雖說這是每天的慣例，也是常年如此，吃些大包子和牛肉，但是老闆非得問過了纔安心似的；而且不說笑話，如其你要換換口味，這茶館而兼飯館的老闆，他簡直做不出第二個菜來。</p>
<p>「來罷，别嚕囉了！」</p>
<p>年紀較大的不耐煩地喊了。在他們間不知道什麽呌禮貌，心裏所要說的話就率直地說出來了，所以老闆聽了還是打着哈哈趕到灶下去。</p>
<p>塡滿了肚皮，他們才從兜肚裏珍貴地掏出烟捲來抽着，有的抽了米截忙搯熄了藏回原處。這時他們都精神興旺起來，老闆也加入了他們的集團，胡拉胡拉的談笑話，談起了女人，他們更是惡樣地做作。他們已忘了長途的拔涉，完全把自已沉醉在夜的懷抱中。</p>
<p>然而，「兄弟們，睡罷！」那年紀較大的命令了，他指着月光底下那輛車子，要在明天天明之前卸下了貨色，才來得及趕回鎭去。</p>
<p>茶棚内的茶桌，橙子，都是他們的臨時眠床，沒有褥，沒有被，那樣隨便地睡了，完了他們一天做人的責任。</p>
<h3>母與子</h3>
<p>— 維煥</p>
<p>六歲的寳兒，活潑地，乖巧地，誰都見了要逗着他玩，他有着一對又大又圓的眸子，還有一只伶俐的小嘴。</p>
<p>「媽······媽······」他慣用這樣的聲調，在沒有事情的事候喚他的母親。</p>
<p>他的母親正在做活計，聽見這樣的呼聲，下意識地望了他一下。在往日，她看了一眼，就很快的縮回來，仍舊做她未完成的衣裳，今天可有點兩樣了，像看見一件秘密似的。</p>
<p>「寳兒」！你來，這頭上的血跡給誰打開的，快說出來，一她用嚴利的目光注視着寳兒。</p>
<p>「媽媽，我不覺痛。」他像求恕似的望着母親。</p>
<p>他常常着見母親發怒的時候，就機警地把身子朶在壁角落，預備來打他時很快的可以逃跑。</p>
<p>「你還不說出來嗎？」聲音顯然有點動怒，把懷裏的衣裳一擲，很快的一把掇了過來，輕輕地爲他揩去了血跡，血還沒有乾，就把香灰按住了。</p>
<p>「寳寳，你是沒有爸爸和兄弟姊妹，多命苦的孩子呵！以後，不要再和阿和一道出去玩，好好的在這裏玩玩吧，寳寳，你曉得嗎？」說着聲音有點顫抖。</p>
<p>阿寳見媽媽已歛了怒容，就很快的溜去了。</p>
<p>跑出大門，就是他小朋友阿和的家裏。阿和比他大兩歲，生就一副凶横的臉孔。柔順的阿寳，常常被他挨打的。　　他出了大門，像已忘掉剛才媽媽對他說明一番話，悄悄地立在壁角裏偷看他們在吃櫻桃，他眼望他們吃得很有味，又紅又甜，一顆顆的往嘴裏塞，饞涎不住的往肚裏嚥，而且又往脣外流，他覺得一隻食指那裏有他們櫻桃的滋味呢，他烏溜溜的眼睛，像老鷹一般的打着滾；他想乘他們不備的時候，去攫一把來，究竟是怎樣味兒的，他躡着脚步走近桌旁，伸手輕輕地攫了三顆，猛不防彼阿和的妹妹看見了。</p>
<p>「哥哥，阿寳搶我們的櫻桃呀！」他們迫切的追上去，終於彼他們攫住了。</p>
<p>這時，阿寳手裏的櫻桃，還是不肯放，嫩白的小手，被他們揑得紅紅的。　　「你搶了我們的東西，還不肯放嗎？」他們兄妹倆這樣的呌喊着，他不肯，我不息，就紛亂的打起來，這時阿寳寡不敵衆，響亮地哭起來，同時頭上又給他們敲了一箇塊。</p>
<p>他媽媽給他的哭聲跑出來，拉了阿寳的一隻手，領他到家裏去了。</p>
<p>「寳寳，你又給誰欺啦？」</p>
<p>阿寳一邊哭着說：一邊揉着眼。</p>
<p>「不要哭，你爸爸明天有更好的東西帶給吃呢。一她溫柔地撫磨着他頭裏的塊說。</p>
<p>她低着頭不停地縫紉，兩年的光陰，就像她的針綫裏悄悄地溜過了。但她並不感到怎樣的孤寂，未來的憧憬，全都寄托在阿寳身上，無論在怎樣極度的煩悶中，她祇要望一望阿寳，種種的苦悶，就會無形地消滅。正像黑暗裏的人們，切望着光明的來臨。</p>
<p>團　的月，像水銀一般地瀉在地上，草上，屋上和一切的景物上，幻成一幅幽美而靜穆的村落，微風帶着溫和的氣息，拂着她們母子二人的身上，阿寳陪在母親的旁邊，時時望着他母親的臉　　「媽媽，你昨天講的故事怎樣了？後來他的爸爸回來沒有？請你再講給我聽吧！」阿寳用乖巧的目光要求他的母親繼續講完這個故事。</p>
<p>「寳寳你愛聽嗎？我就講下去丨丨那時她幾次三番的寫信去催他歸來。一天下午，他果眞回來民了······他是消瘦得很可憐呵！寳寳············他患着可怕的咯血症，沒有寛裕的金錢與他治療，到家還不上一月，就棄了他們母子遠去了，也許是永不回來的了。他剩下一個四歲的孩子，一個年靑的少婦，在這世上，沒有父親的兒子，和沒有丈夫的婦人，始終沒有得到人們的同情······她們以後的生活，不消說是很淸苦的了，她的孩子，據說現在已有六歲了，他的媽媽很鍾愛他，名字就呌做寳寳丨丨她講到這裏，阿寳在她膝上呼呼的睡熟了。祇見她眼淚像斷珠似的落下來，在明亮的月光下閃鑠着。</p>

<h3>裸體運動</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>内體，本來就是靈性動物的模型，人類，當然也是一樣：雌雄之别，乃是一種生理上具有不同的形態和個性。男女之間，也爲了生理關係之不同，而引出也許多隔閡與奇蹟；其實，牠的五管四肢，各人都沒有什麽多大的差别，生活也是同樣的。</p>
<p>世人有創美醜之說者，每以外形爲標凖。所以數千年來，宋玉，潘安，西施，王嬙，均爲世人所羨慕，而反之，猛揚，嫫母之輩，却爲人人所垂棄的了。</p>
<p>從前西子病心而顰，人皆美之；是以後來的美人，總要常帶三分病的。可是近代歐風吹遍了中國，那些弱不禁風的病美人，亦已一跳而變爲體魄結實的女英雄，將肉體的美，赤裸裸地貢獻於人們的面前，於是，街頭，市稍，每見一般摩登密司們，曲綫畢露，玉腿掩映，袒胸露臂的招搖過市，引得一班急色兒，眞是纔涎欲滴。近且，有人袒胸露臂猶嫌未足，而竟大膽地提倡起裸體運動來，必欲將古今人所諱言的男女秘密完全暴露。幾年以來，裸體運動熱甚囂塵上，無奈均爲當局所禁止，遂不得使牠不脛而走，到處風行，一般裸體同志，殊覺怏怏！</p>
<p>按此風首先起於德國，美國繼之。吾國漢口，在數年以前，亦曾有此一度風聞，然而曾幾何時，又被當局取締了。最近香港，號稱裸體聖地的香粉寮地方，有一個「裸體運動會」，會長是西人達連氏，會裏同志很不少；不過還沒有女性加入，這不免有些遺憾！而他們却有一個積極的辦法，就是凡在會會員，每人必須帶一個女性參加。日來天氣漸熱，溽暑將臨，因此裸處運動，亦應時地活躍起來了。聽說該會並已凖備向各省各埠活動；據達氏對人表示，對此似有幾分把握。這件事，似乎可信的；因爲吾們見六日本埠報載「盛夏將届，裸體運動囂傳滬市，虹口區域已成立支部說，一說租界决不容其立足·········」云。不錯，吾們在那糢糊的腦筋上似乎還約略記憶得起，去年此時，曾有過這末一回事的，可是不幸（？）得很，後來爲市商會得知了這個消息：而馬上函請租界當局查禁了。於是，這轟傳一時，萬人翹首的裸體運動，終於沒有出現在大上海，吾們也只有自嘆眼福淺薄！如果今年這舉動，租界當局肯通融的話，那麽行見這些半遮半掩的倒可絶跡，而乾脆來玩一套赤裸裸地一絲不掛的裸體美；反正，大家都有的是肉體，還有什麽神秘可言？回復了原始狀態，返還到自然生活，豈不大好麽？</p>
<p>提倡者說：「裸體運動不是羞恥事，對於人類確有極大關係的，因爲大自然間的日光浴，空氣浴，和水浴，是能使人們的體魄强健和淸潔。况且，吾們以淸白的肝膽，廉潔的身體，坦然你吾共見，事實上並不能說它是羞恥事。人類並非無恥的，但如偷竊，姦淫，當娼，偷偷摸摸，這纔算是羞恥！這在數千年來的中國，將男女之間看得太神秘了，所以才有這樣的遺毒！······」照他們的表示，正不愧理由充足，態度光明；恰和幾年前的某博士提倡「性學」，眞有巽曲同工之妙，而且更爲大膽。這事實能否實現，吾們却不妨拭目以俟之。</p>
<h3>出賣</h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>爲了路延續生命，所以不得不設法來維持生活；然而，又爲了要維持生活的緣故，於是，什麽都得出賣了。出賣人格，出賣良心，出賣肉體，出賣妻子兒女，賣笑，賣血，出賣勞力，出賣腦汁，出賣·········好！賣吧，儘量的出賣吧！反正，現實的世界上，一切都得出賣，一切都得廉價出賣！</p>
<p>但，吾却沒有良心好賣，而人格也是不値錢的東西，肉體是一個臭皮囊，妻子兒女更不必說，當然沒有人要；笑是苦笑，笑中藏滿了熱淚的，還有誰會歡迎呢？至於血，吾又是一個患貧血症的人，那里還有血可賣，所以，吾唯一的出賣對象，只有勞力和腦汁；雖然，吾也知道出賣勞力和腦汁是最痛苦而得不到相當代價的勾當，可是不賣又不行。並且，有時候，也許連勞力和腦汁還沒有受主啦！要想不賣吧！然而，生活的重負，却緊緊地壓住在胸頭；那會使吾不由自主地去出賣的。但是，出賣的結果，生活依然延續不下。</p>
<p>講到吾現在的生活，眞是非入的生活，終日只在屈服與受氣之下。一天實足十七小時工作，而所得的報酬，不過幾毛錢的代價，吃的，住的，穿的，還不如那些勞工神聖。何况吾除了出賣勞力之外，還得要去出賣腦汁呢！這賣腦汁的痛苦，誰多曉得的，但是吾却連出賣腦汁的自由都被剝奪殆盡了。</p>
<p>人類需要生活來維持生命的，但，生活又得到那里去找呢？在這樣的社會，這樣的世界，到處都在嚷着「不景氣」，各業又是人浮於事，要想尋一噉飯之地，眞好比難若登天。然而，世界儘是矛盾的，社會也在畸形的開展着，處在這不平衡的狀態下。前進者過度的前進，沒落的相繼着沒落，出賣腦汁和勞力者，總不昨一飽，反之，終日坐着不動的，倒是吃得肚子膨脹。一方面，金錢和女人在他們懹裏跳動，而吾們却只有腦汁和汗血在迸流，不住的迸流！唉！這是什麽社會？</p>

<p>文塲本來是搖動筆捍兒的人們，以文會友的地盤，可是自從被一羣帶了算盤的商人作家在耀武揚威以後，文塲也就變成了商塲。商人作家其爲文也并不是在「以文會友」，而志在賺錢。因爲志在賺錢，便亂七八糟地粗製濫造以欺騙讀者亦在所不顧，這呌做賣野人頭。而這文塲的商塲偏和四馬路靑蓮閣一樣，有商人在打算盤，出賣貨物，也有跟着商人一起進來的出賣靈魂的野鷄。商人唯利是視，人格不顧，有時連人格與貨物一起出賣都不要緊，只要有錢可賺；野鷄左右謟笑，善於逢迎，也是連人格與貨物一起出賣都不在乎，只要嫖客破鈔，於是乎銅臭薫天，得意揚揚。商人作家之賣野人頭也，旣然志在賺錢，於是乎八面玲瓏，各方討好，又有所謂烏龜政策。所謂烏龜政策，卽是「增廣」書上說，「近來學得鳥龜法，得縮頭處且縮頭」，任憑人家唾駡，縮起頭來不管，亦卽是大丈夫能屈能伸的能忍美德。而野鷄作家之登龍妙訣，却在於頌揚野人頭，左右恭維，得實野人頭者的片言隻語的提詙，蒼蠅附着驥馬的尾巴，扶遙千里，左右逢源。</p>
<p>賣野人頭的交易已經在文塲上成爲一椿好買賣，近來又有賣死人頭的嶄新超絶的生意經，說是文人死後爲貴，於是乎萬商雲集，死人頭價格高漲，野人頭原廠出品終究有限，死人頭又更是鳳毛麟角，市面行情，價高者日益高漲，而野人頭與死人頭可以操縱市價無疑。商塲重於競爭，文塲不能例外，競爭結局，野鷄作家經賣野人頭者的提拔而爲野人頭，到那時野人頭行情如不慘跌，恐怕舊的野人頭都成爲死人頭，而死人頭的市價更爲高漲，定在意料之中了。</p>

<h3>節母坊（一）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>差不多是從來沒有的事，一個六歲的孩子果然能够如此機警的剛一天亮便自已悄悄的起來。自然，這使他非常興奮，祇要一想起昨天晚上，長工灰鷄婆答應在今天早上帶他到田坂上去捉蟋蟀，而且可以到村裏去玩。原因是，到村裏去在他是十分少有的事，雖然他的家隔村裏不過是四五百步之遙，可是在他的習慣中，差不多是到另一個世界中去似的。</p>
<p>他懷着一夥奇異的心，靜悄悄的摸索着打開每一扇通到廚房裏的門，從後門出去走向灰屋裏去。極重的歡喜在心頭跳躍，一路上低聲的喊着：</p>
<p>「灰鷄婆哥！······」</p>
<p>可是沒有答應的聲音，這使他十分擔心，難道說他已經去了麽？果然，灰屋裏不見他在睡覺，他幾乎要哭出來了。他再焦急的從菜園裏跑向大門，微弱的光地，極稀薄的洒在地上。遠遠的似乎看見前面有一塊石頭，他很小心希望踏在石塊上跨過去，可是踏着的却是一團水。原來不知道在什麽時候下了一次雨，不過他記得昨天在蜘蛛忙着結網的黃昏，還是沒有落一滴小雨的。一直跑出大門，在那一株蓋過大路的陽傘樹下面，他似乎看見了灰鷄婆還在挑着空　向前走，前面還有幾個他所認得的人，都是臨時請來帮忙割稻子的。於是他拚命的跑過去，扯住他的衣角，幾乎要哭出來。只見他停下來摩着小主人的頭頂說：</p>
<p>「什麽？你眞的要我帶你去嗎？回頭給你母親知道要駡我的哩。」</p>
<p>「不管」，小主人說：「你帶我去好了。」</p>
<p>「他要去幹什麽呢？」另一個人問。他們都停下來不走了。</p>
<p>「昨天晚上，他就跟我說，也我帶他到田坂上捉蟋蟀去。」</p>
<p>「捉蟋蟀？自家園子裏多着哩，爲什麽要到村裏去！」</p>
<p>「誰知道，他根本就是想和我們到村裏玩兒去。」</p>
<p>「哼，這個小孩兒也太可憐了，一天到晚關在家裏，又沒有一個小孩兒和他來往，怎麽能使他不想往外面跑呢？」</p>
<p>「好罷，又是灰鷄婆說：「坐在籮裏米，我挑你去。可是回頭你母親駡你，你可别往我身上推呀。」</p>
<p>於是小主人史時敏便快樂的爬到籮裏去。後面籮裏裝的。一大瓦壺的茶。　起來正好記擔，前後的重量，差不了很多。</p>

<h3>中國電影演員簡論（中）</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>至於趙丹和鄭君里二位，我們知道都是由舞台到銀幕極有成績的天才演員，特别是趙丹，更是明星公司最會做戲的小生。再加之他們二人都有很好的學問修養，對社會有着深切的認識，當然是前途遠大無窮，謹在此爲他們祝福。但是消息來，鄭君是在給一個善吃辣椒的女人弄得昏頭昏腦，從前所熱心幹的事，現在一槪置之度外。而趙丹仁兄也在單戀着一個新發現的舞台演員，這樣一來，不能不爲之擔憂。寄語二君，大好前途，千萬别在我愛你你愛我聲中輕輕斷送了。而演技上的比較，那末趙丹是更多方面一些的，鄭君里却以「人生」的典型最成功。另一方面，同樣也以小生資格上銀幕的，如何非光，蔣君超，龔稼農，孫敏諸人，都個别的有其介偶然的成績，而後二人較爲遲鈍一些。唯有張振鐸却眞是無可誇獎，他雖然是那般年紀，但有時還是小生扮裝哩，這是難於理解的了。假使可能的話，他應當扮裝中年而完全放棄文明戲的成分。</p>
<p>無可否認的，生活糜爛，不學無術，乃是一部份演員失敗的致命傷。特别是有些女演員，更染着這一通病。我們不必像煞有介事的指明誰淸白，誰又不淸白，我們也不必因着某人過去的品行不端而作爲蓄意攻訐的焦點，不過事實俱在，眞正希望自已長進的電影演員、應當從私人生活上改善，祇有這樣才能杜絶别人的口實，方能使自已不致被人目爲被玩弄的女性，也祇有這樣才能成爲完全的社會人以及求得演技上之進展。可不是嗎？女演員所以被人們看不起，目爲娼妓同等，所以有人喊着跳出黑暗的電影圈，所以謠傳着誰是台基，誰是達官貴人的外婦，難道不是她們自招侮辱嗎？雖然我們也承認，在現社會中，頗有姿色的女人，要想做一個完人，要想不做商品而不出賣肉體，的確不是一椿容易的事。然而給千萬觀衆所嘱望的女演員，到底得覺悟的潔身自愛，爲了自已的前途，就使生活得淸苦一點，也是很有意義的。（未完）</p>

<h3>評「大富之家」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＴｈｅＨｏｕｓｅｏｆＲｏｔｈｓｃｈｉｌｄ</p>
<p>丨南京丨（一）</p>
<p>據說，這是一部歷史影片，也是二十世紀公司認爲本年度最偉大的出品。所謂歷史劇自然是根據於歷史的某一葉而編製的劇本，然而某一葉歷史在今日能被採爲電影之題材，决不是一椿偶然的事。譬如說在目前的中國，假使將秦始皇的虐政，以至於陳勝吳廣的揭竿起義，作爲電影的題材，决不是沒有價値的。而歷史的片段，在通過了劇作者的世界觀之後，拿破崙大戰當時的歷史，能反映在「大富之家」的電影中來，一定有其時代的意義。所以，我們對於「大富之家」决不應當因其爲歷史的記載便忽視劇作者觀念的檢討，正相反，祇有這樣才是作品之本質的批判。</p>
<p>（二）「大富之家」所叙述的故事是這樣的：</p>
<p>在猶太人街中，那裏有一羣襤褸的猶太人。他們在黃昏的時候，便被一道鐵練的網封鎖，和猶太人街以外的地方隔離着，不能和外人相往來。</p>
<p>這一羣上帝的選民是被人們輕視着的，成爲下賤的民族，同時就在人們所認爲汚穢齷齪的生活中，我們看見一個老頭兒藏匿着他的錢，告訴他的兒子們怎樣保守他的錢，當官吏來敲詐時候，他們是怎樣裝扮爲窮酸。······也許這便是所謂嗇吝的猶太人之素描罷。直到他臨死的時候，他敎給他的五個孩子怎校樣增加財產的利潤，並且成爲爭奪自由平等之手段。丨丨這算是序曲。</p>
<p>接上我們便看見這Ｒｏｔｈｓｃｈｉｌｄ的錢莊分佈了全歐洲的各地，他們已經擴大了他們父親的資財，而當拿破崙掃蕩歐洲的時候，每一個錢莊所在地的高級官憲，都在向他們借欵，以作爲抵抗拿破崙之軍費。這時英國大將威靈呑也到了倫敦的「大富之家。」就由於他們兄弟的借　，恊約國征服了拿破崙并且將他放逐到巴爾幹　上去了。但是他們所希望的猶太人的自由平等，終於沒有得到，而且猶太人的家屋被人們擲着石塊。甚至於威靈呑所告訴南丹的公債投標，也沒有獲得勝利。直至拿破崙又從关島逃走了以後，整個的歐洲又像陷在地震中的一般驚恐。於是恊約國的政治家將軍們又得求助於這猶太人之家，並且答允了他們要求保障自由平等的條件。到後來南丹露德蔡諸兄弟，冒着極大的危險。直至滑鐵鑪大戰之後，拿破崙再敗，而主人公南丹也受了英國皇家之男爵的封位，猶太人的姑娘也能與威靈呑部下之大將結婚了。</p>
<p>（三）在這故事中告訴我們一些什麽呢？猶太人是愛好和平的，猶太人在大戰中發了財，猶太人因接濟恊約國之軍餉而獲得了爵位，猶太人在拿破崙敗後便獲了自由平等之待遇了。這些是否全是歷史之眞實的記載，我們不必在此置辯，而劇作者的認識，却在此表白了。假使有錢的猶太人可以拿出錢來，打擊歐洲的覇主，便可以抬高他們的地位。但是拿破崙敗後，是否就是眞正的和平呢？而且他們援助軍餉，是否就是爲了和平的奠定呢？與其說是爲了公理或正義，到毌寗說是大富翁戰事的投機吧。敎育錢人犧牲自已的一切來維持和平，這在事實上無論如何是不多見的。至於說從他們手中來獲得民族的自由平等，更是難能可貴的事了。不過他們有錢人却因着軍事投機而買得了爵位，到是我們可以相信的，但這决不是民族解放。</p>
<p>進一步說，歐洲大戰之中，有不少人因軍事投機而發了財，但是德國的戰敗並不是世界的和平。雖然戰後也有一個短時期的資本主義之穏定，可是這一時期早已過去，現在是新的動力在不住的生長，而第二次大戰也快要爆發在目前。所以眞正的和平，决不是建築在少數人身上。</p>
<p>因此，在這裏所表現出來的劇作者的意識，是包含着某種煽動的。至於或許有人說，這是德希特勒驅逐猶太人的反應，也許在這裏頗有附會的可能，果如此，是否就是敎被驅逐着的猶太富翁，帮助軍事野心消滅獨裁政治的德國，而打擊希特勒的國家主義呢？這是我們所不懂的。</p>
<p>總之，我們對於這一影片，决不可相信劇中的唆示，而認爲那是同情弱小民族解放的作品，相反的，他們的解放，無非是富翁們的解放。卽就目前來說，猶太富翁在歐洲握着金融界之絶大勢力，而另一方面猶太民族的勞苦大衆，却始終是毫無國土的在歐美各地操着下賤的苦役，不平等待遇，始終像鐵練一樣繞住着他們的全身。</p>
<p>然而在國家主義跋巵的目前，猶太富翁必然因着民族的關係而被另一民族所排擠，這在德國特别表現得至爲明顯。所以如敎掌握金融之樞紐的猶太人，帮助恊約國消滅正在跋巵着的德國野心家，有如消滅當年的拿破崙一樣，不是毫無原因的；在軍縮會議不能得着他們所想像的效果的當時。這是製片者的政治野心，但是所謂世界和平，却無論如何是一種可怕的欺騙。</p>
<p>（四）至於說這一影片爲什麽對於英國那般表示好感的？那我們當然不能忽視歷史之根據，因爲威靈呑的成功，確實得力於露德蔡不少。又如蘇彝士運河之英國的收買，也是露德蔡一家拿出錢來的。何况亞立斯和卡洛夫諸人都是英國人。</p>
<p>（五）我們從整個的作品來說，在自首至尾劇的發展上，劇作者是極聰明的充分的維持了他的主張，很難看到他意識的矛盾。譬如說他要那富翁南丹向政治當局提出自由平等之要求，而迫着他們簽字，首先便敎我們看見他們自已的家庭也遭受人們石塊的抛擲，使南丹兄弟深感有平等待遇之必要；雖然另一方面，我們也看到他在公債投標的當時，因着那班政治家的操縱而沒有操着勝算。一直到最後爲止，他都自然的將故事發展下去，以至英庭的大受封，而勝利的結論了他的主張。另一方面，南丹的女兒之嫁給英軍官，雖然在劇中只佔着一小部份，但是不能通婚以至於高攀大將，却是强調了劇的主題的。</p>
<p>（六）同樣，自導演以至於表演，都是非常勝利的成功了的。從每一塲面之劇的成份的十分充實，以致於劇的ＴＥＭＰＯ之把握，都顯出電影藝術在現階段中之最高發展。也許有人說當寫到英倫之外的其他四兄弟之支店時，導演運用着完全相同的手法，不免覺着笨拙，然而這是一種不當的評語，因爲旣然不能讓一個故事分四條綫平均發展下去，那末就得極簡潔的聚中在一條主綫上，而完全運用省略法將其餘枝節略去，所以那種採用同樣的方法，正是一種大膽而合理的嘗試。</p>
<p>至於喬其亞理士和卡洛夫的表演技術，直是達到了爐火純靑的地步，不，甚至於那個做南丹兄弟之母親的也是十分成功的。我們簡直可以這樣說，每一個不重要的配角，都有恰到好處的成績。假使我們要看現代電影之藝術，特别是表演技巧，那我們認爲這一「大富之家」，乃是値得十分注意的了。</p>
<p>（七）再還要說到的，便是佈景或攝影收音成功，幾乎是我們用不着在此特别稱讚的，反正在　大的資本之下，這些都是無可否認的做到了。</p>
<p>不過却有人完全給這「偉大」二字迷惑了，非批判的接受作品的全部。所謂「一個弱小民族的反抗，同時向世界作和平之呼籲，以完成了······電影的使命，」這種大膽錯誤的論調，應當是我們所指斥的。</p>

<p>Nervous Breakdown, Suicidal Intent</p>
<p>Taken Back from Suma to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deputy Consul Kuramoto of the Japanese Consulate General was safely found around 1:00 PM on the 13th. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Incident of Japanese Deputy Consul Kuramoto, Plainclothes Police Searched the Suburbs. On the 13th, a Squad from the Special Police Division of the Police Department Went to Ming Xiaoling and Other Places, Searching Strictly. They Received Reports from Villagers That a Suspicious Person Had Been Wandering in the Mountains for Several Days, Wearing a Suit, Seeming Not to Be a Local. The Police Went to the Back Mountain of Ming Xiaoling and Searched Deeply. They Indeed Found a Person Leaning Against a Tree, Looking Extremely Weak. They Took Out a Photo of Mr. Kuramoto to Compare and Knew That He Was Indeed Kuramoto Himself. Therefore, They Devised Various Plans to Help Him Down the Mountain and Hired a Car Back to Nanjing. It Was a Little After 2:00 PM. They Went Directly to the Police Department, Where Director Chen Zhuo Met Him. Director Chen Had Known Mr. Kuramoto for a Long Time. They Shook Hands and Wept. Director Chen Advised Him to Eat Some Milk, Biscuits, Etc. Kuramoto Was Very Grateful and Drank Two Cups of Milk and a Cup of Soda. Mr. Kuramoto Gave the Following Account: On the Evening of the 8th, I Originally Wanted to Send Ambassador Arishima Off, But There Were Not Enough Seats in the Car (He Wept as He Said This), So I Didn't Send Him Off. I Personally Took a Rickshaw Out of Zhongshan Gate, Along Zhongshan Avenue. Before Reaching Zhongshan Mausoleum, I Turned Into a Mountain Path and Went Up Zijin Mountain. Arriving at the Mountain, I Looked at Nanjing City. The Lights Were Brightly Shining. I Bided Farewell to Nanjing. (He Raised His Right Hand to His Forehead.) There Was a Wooden Frame There. I Nailed My Photos and Business Cards to the Frame as a Memorial. I Had Never Been to Zijin Mountain Before. I Thought There Must Be Many Huge Beasts on the Mountain. At That Time, I Was Lying Under a Tree When I Suddenly Heard the Sound of a Leopard, Coming Closer and Closer. I Took Off My Clothes and Buried Them in the Ground as Food. The Reason for Taking Off and Burying My Clothes Was, First, to Give Convenience to the Leopard, and Second, to Leave No Trace. However, the Leopard Came and Went Several Times, But Never Appeared. The Next Day (the 9th), I Was Very Thirsty on the Mountain, So I Went Down the Mountain to Find Water to Drink. There Was No Spring Water to Drink in the Zixia Cave and Ming Xiaoling Area of Zijin Mountain. That Evening, I Was Still on the Mountain. The Next Day (the 10th), I Was Very Hungry and Thirsty. I Went to a Teahouse Down the Mountain Once to Drink Tea. I Intended to Dig a Big Hole to End My Life, But Because I Had Been Fasting for a Day, I Was Too Weak. So, on the Morning of the 11th, I Went to a Small Noodle Restaurant Down the Mountain and Ate a Bowl of Noodles. When I Went, I Only Had a Couple of Silver Coins Left. Later, I Took Off a Gold Button from My Clothes and Gave It to the Teahouse as Payment, But the Teahouse Didn't Accept It, Saying That Since I Had Forgotten to Bring Money, I Could Pay It Back Next Time. I Don't Want to Talk About the Meaning of This Trip. (He Shed Tears as He Said This.) I Don't Want to Make It Public After Returning to the Consulate. I Originally Didn't Want to Return to Nanjing, But Because the Personnel of Your Department Were Very Sincere, I Was Moved, So I Came Back With Them. At That Time, I Thought to Myself, My Survival or Death Has Nothing to Do With the Empire or Your Country. Now That I Have Returned, Your Country Owes Me Nothing, and I Owe Your Country Nothing. Don't Ask Me Why I Did This. I Don't Want to Say. (He Shed Tears as He Said This.) Then, Director Chen Advised Him to Rest a Little. Mr. Kuramoto Sat on the Sofa, Frequently Raising His Hand to His Forehead. Around 3:00 PM, Shen Jinding, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Dijun, Director of the Intelligence Department, Gu Zhenglun, Garrison Commander, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and Xu Peigen, Director of the General Staff Headquarters, All Heard the News and Visited the Police Department. All of These People Knew Kuramoto and Comforted Him Together. Around 4:00 PM, Shen Jinding Accompanied Him to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Then to the Japanese Consulate. The Strange Mystery That Had Been Widely Reported in Chinese and Foreign Newspapers for Days Had Come to an End. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since 9:30 AM on the 9th of This Month, After Being Notified by Personnel Sent by the Japanese Consulate General That Deputy Consul Kuramoto Was Missing, the Police Department Immediately Began a Strict Search at 12:00 PM That Morning. Police Were Dispatched for Several Days, First to the Most Complex Residential Areas in Nanjing and Places Where Foreigners Frequently Visited, Conducting a Thorough Search, But to No Avail. Then, They Turned to the Suburbs and the Areas Along the Jingwu Road Under the Jurisdiction of the Riverside Police Stations, Strictly Ordering the Subordinate Police Stations to Search Separately. Starting on the 12th, They Instructed the Police in Each District With Search Standards: (1) Those With Suspicious Behavior, (2) Those Who Don't Speak the Local Dialect, (3) Those With Strange Appearance, (4) Those Who Seem to Have Mental Illness. All Should Be Noticed, and a Large Reward Was Offered to Ensure Discovery. At 9:00 AM on the 13th, They Received a Call From Zhang, a Local Resident Near the Mausoleum Garden, Requesting That They Send Personnel Quickly, Saying That He Had Important Information to Report. They Immediately Instructed Zhang to Wait in Front of the Tomb in the Mausoleum Garden and Sent Personnel to the Designated Location to Meet Zhang. According to Zhang, Someone Came This Morning to Ask for Water to Drink. The Person Was About 40 Years Old, of Medium Height, With a Small Mustache, Wearing a Semi-New Western Suit. After Drinking the Water, He Walked Slowly Up the Mountain Alone. The Personnel Went to the Mountain Behind the Mausoleum Garden to Search According to This Clue. Around 11:00 AM, They Found a Person Under Zijin Mountain Behind Ming Xiaoling. His Appearance, Build, and Age Were Similar to Those Described by Zhang. He Looked Spiritless, With Disheveled Hair and a Dirty Face. When Asked His Name and Origin, He Was Evasive and Hesitated to Speak. The Personnel, Because He Was Suspicious, Took Out the Photo of Kuramoto That Had Been Prepared in Advance and Compared Them With Each Other. They Felt That They Were Very Similar, and Then Knew That He Was Undoubtedly Kuramoto. They Sincerely Told Him About the Government's Order to the Military Police to Search After the Deputy Consul Left, and Invited Him to Go Down the Mountain and Get Into a Car to Enter the City. Kuramoto Initially Seemed Negative and Refused the Request. After Repeated Persuasion, He Finally Got Into the Car. It Was a Little After 2:00 PM When They Entered the City. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At Noon on the 13th, Kuramoto Eimei, the Japanese Deputy Consul Stationed in Nanjing, Was Discovered by Our Police and Military Police on Ming Xiaoling Mountain. He Was Immediately Escorted Into the City to the Police Department, Where He Was Greeted by Director Chen. Personnel Were Then Dispatched to Escort Him to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Where Suma, the Japanese Consul General Stationed in Nanjing, and Arayano, a Counselor at the Japanese Embassy, Picked Him Up and Took Him Back to the Consulate. According to Reports, Kuramoto Took a Rickshaw Out of the City Alone on the Evening of the 8th and Climbed the Mountain, Attempting Suicide Unsuccessfully. At Noon on the 13th, After Kuramoto Was Escorted to the Police Department by the Police and Military Police, Mai Jiayan, a Reporter From the China United Press, Bi Fanyu, an American Minister, and Zhao Minheng, a Reporter From Reuters, Went to Comfort Him and Inquire About the Details. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Another Source, the Reasons Why Kuramoto Was Mentally Disturbed and Had Suicidal Thoughts Were as Follows: (1) Kuramoto Has Been in the Japanese Diplomatic Service for More Than 20 Years, But He Is Still a Deputy Consul, Feeling Frustrated. (2) Ambassador Arishima Came to Nanjing This Time, and Kuramoto Was Not Included in the Japanese Consulate's Banquet, Which Made Him Extremely Angry. (3) When Sending Ambassador Arishima to Shanghai, Kuramoto Prepared Luggage for the Ambassador, But Could Not Get a Seat in the Car. His Nerves Received a Great Shock, and He Was Angry and World-Weary. Another Saying Is That Kuramoto Had a Quarrel With His Wife Before Leaving. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Confirmed News. The Reason for Kuramoto's Suicide Was Due to His Personal Pessimism and Weariness of the World. The Detailed Reason Is Being Studied. Some People, Because His Suicide Action Was So Peculiar, Questioned Him, Saying, "If You Want to Die, Just Die. Why Do You Have to Hide Like This?" Kuramoto Said, "After I Climbed the Mountain, I Was Afraid That Wild Animals Would Come and Harm Me. I Once Wanted to Commit Seppuku, But I Didn't Bring a Sword, and I Didn't Have Money to Buy a Knife, So I Couldn't Do It." When Asked Why He Didn't Think of His Life's Work When He Thought of Committing Suicide, Kuramoto Said, "I Was Really in Great Pain. I Had to Say Goodbye to the World." When Asked Why He Didn't Think of His Children, Kuramoto Said, "There Is No Need to Worry About Children. It's Like a Tree Has Already Sprouted. Why Worry That It Won't Grow Up?" When Asked If He Didn't Think of His Beloved Wife, Kuramoto Said, "My Wife Is Not Enough to Stop My Suicidal Thoughts." When He Was Told That Since the News of His Disappearance Spread, His Old Mother in Japan Had Been Crying All Day Long, Didn't He Think of This? Kuramoto Knelt Down, Raised His Hands to the Top of His Head and Pressed Them Together, Repeatedly Saying "Amitabha Buddha," Tears Streaming Down His Face, and Cried Bitterly. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Deputy Consul Kuramoto Was Found by the Police Department on the 13th, the Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Shen Jinding, Was Notified to Go to the Department to Talk With Mr. Kuramoto. Director Shen Immediately Went to Meet Mr. Kuramoto, First Comforting Him, Then Asking About the Situation After His Disappearance, and Its Reasons and Motives. Mr. Kuramoto Did Not Want to Say the Reasons and Motives, and Said That Without the Consent of the Consul General, He Would Not Make It Public. He Only Described His Experiences in the Mountains, and Also Talked About and Drew a Diagram of Where He Hid and Stayed. The Following Is What Mr. Kuramoto Said in Response: "I (Kuramoto Self-Described) Intended to Depart This World on the Evening of the 8th. I Originally Planned to Send Ambassador Arishima and Other Secretaries to the Station to Say Goodbye, But Because There Were Not Enough Seats in the Car, I Gave Up and Let My Colleagues and Guests From Shanghai Go. I Originally Wanted to Go to Qixia Mountain, But Because the Train Time Was Not Suitable, I Changed My Destination to Zijin Mountain. The Local Staff Had All Gone to Xiaguan. I Left the Consulate at About 10:45 PM and Hired a Rickshaw Separately, Asking Him to Pull Me to Outside Zhongshan Gate. When the Rickshaw Arrived at Zhongshan Gate, the Rickshaw Puller Refused to Leave the City Because It Was Too Late. I Got Out of the Rickshaw in Front of Zhongshan Gate and Walked Out of the City. I Walked to the Top of Zijin Mountain, Looking Down at the City. I Saw the Electric Lights Shining Brightly. I Was Filled With Emotions. I Put My Hands Together and Said Goodbye to All My Relatives and Friends in the City. At That Time, I Had Realized Everything. After Saying Goodbye, I Climbed the Triangular Tower on Zijin Mountain. When Climbing the Tower, I Took a Few Business Cards and Photos From the Business Card Holder, Tied Them With a Handkerchief, and Hung Them on the Handrail of the Triangular Tower as a Sign That I Had Been Here. I Spent the Night on the Mountain That Evening. I Suddenly Encountered a Large Wild Animal, Similar to a Leopard or a Large Wildcat. I Had Already Decided to Commit Suicide, So I Didn't Have to Worry About Being Chewed to Death by It. I Was Only Afraid That If I Was Bitten to Death by a Wild Animal, My Clothes Would Definitely Be Left in That Place and Easily Discovered by People. I Took Off My Clothes and Buried Them in the Ground, Waiting Quietly for It to Attack. Unexpectedly, This Beast Chased Other Small Animals Elsewhere. Then, I Thought That Being Bitten to Death by a Wild Animal Was Not Worth It, So I Lodged on a Pine Tree, But the Large Wild Animal Never Came Again. The Next Day, I Went Down the Mountain. Then, Because I Wanted to See the Beautiful Scenery of the Sunrise, I Climbed the Mountain Again. At This Time, I Was Very Hungry, So I Walked to Zixia Cave to Drink Water. Last Night, I Spent the Night on a Large Tree Near Zixia Cave. There Were Also Many Wild Animals Near That Place, But I Was Still Safe and Sound, and I Felt Very Happy Instead." (At This Time, Director Shen Took Out a Slip of Paper and Asked Him to Draw a Diagram and Dates.) Kuramoto Continued, "Until the 10th, I Went From Zixia Cave to the Back Mountain of Zhongshan Mausoleum. At That Time, I Planned to Fast and Die Here. So, I Planned to Move Stones to Build a Place to Die. However, There Were Too Few Stones in That Place to Build a Grave. On the Evening of the 10th, I Spent the Night on a Large Tree in That Place. On the Evening of the 11th, I Went From Zhongshan Mausoleum to the Back Mountain of Ming Xiaoling. I Also Moved Stones in That Place and Started Building a Grave Again. However, Because That Place Was Close to the Edge of the City and There Was a Small Road, I Was Deeply Worried That After I Died in That Place, the Corpse Would Smell Bad and Be Easily Discovered by People. Therefore, I Changed My Plan Again and Walked Further Into the Mountains. I Found a Cave. This Cave Seemed to Be a Nest of Wild Animals. I Modified This Cave a Little and Hid in It. However, Until the 12th, Because of Intense Hunger, I Slinked Out of the Cave to Drink Water Again. On the Evening of the 12th, I Returned to the Cave to Spend the Night. Today, I Was So Hungry That I Couldn't Bear It Anymore, So I Went Out of the Cave Again and Went to a Teahouse in Front of Ming Xiaoling to Drink Tea. At That Time, There Were Only Two Mao Coins in My Pocket. I Paid the Teahouse Fee. However, Because I Was Very Hungry, I Ate Noodles Again, So I Gave a Pair of Gold Buttons to the Teahouse Landlady. She Said That What I Ate Was of Very Little Value and Refused to Accept It, Saying That I Could Wait Until Next Time. I Replied That I Might Not Come Again, So I Gave This Button to a Nearby Worker, Asking Him to Buy Chicken Eggs for Me. I Went Back to the Cave to Rest. However, the Nearby Residents Already Knew That I Was Hiding in the Mountains, So They Searched the Mountains Extensively and Were Finally Discovered by Them. The Above Is the Situation After I Left the Consulate on the Evening of the 8th Until I Was Discovered. I Regret That I Went Out of the Mountain to Find Food and Drink, Which Caused the Residents to Be Suspicious." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>

Because He Had No Money, He Wanted to Leave His Western Shirt and Gold Cufflinks With the Store Owner Liu Fengxiang. Liu Told Him That If He Had No Money, He Could Send It Over Tomorrow. Kuramoto Said That It Didn't Matter and That He Would Bring the Money Tomorrow to Pick It Up. So, He Put Down the Gold Cufflinks and Left. At That Time, Liu Did Not Suspect That He Was Japanese Because Kuramoto Spoke Fluent Chinese. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An American Newspaper Reporter Went to the Japanese Embassy to Collect News About Kuramoto's Disappearance. According to What He Told People Afterwards, the Embassy Staff Said at That Time That After Returning Home, Kuramoto Himself Said That His Hiding Was Entirely Due to "Family Matters and Too Slow Promotion." Kuramoto Did Not Admit That He Planned to Commit Suicide. According to Kuramoto, After Leaving the Japanese Embassy on Friday Evening, After Sending Japanese Ambassador Arishima to Shanghai, He Hired a Rickshaw to Dongmen and Sneaked Into the City, Not Noticed by the Garrison. Then, He Climbed Zijin Mountain Behind Xiaoling, Looking at the Sleeping City From Afar, Raising His Hand Over His Head and Waving and Calling Out, "Goodbye, Everything, Everything." When Describing This, Someone Asked Why He Hid. Kuramoto Said Excitedly That He Only Wanted to "Escape." It Is Said That He Hastily Started to Build a Windbreak That Evening, Piling Up Stone Walls. During These Days, Kuramoto Was on the Mountain. At Night, He Moved Stones to Build a Windbreak. During the Day, He Leisuredly Traveled at the Foot of the Mountain. The First Person to Discover Him Was a Farmer, At One O'Clock in the Afternoon. He Was Lying in This Small Hut. The Farmer Reported to the Police Station, and Kuramoto Was Taken to Headquarters.</p>
<p>After Kuramoto Arrived at the Police Station, He Stayed for a Very Short Time. At This Time, He Was Questioned by the Staff, and He Declared That His Disappearance Was Automatic, Because He Lost Some Official Documents Last Week and Was Reprimanded by His Superior, Which Was Inevitably Embarrassing. According to Kuramoto's Appearance, Although He Was Very Exhausted, There Were No Obvious Difficulties or Physical Abnormalities. When the American Newspaper Reporter Went to the Police Station, Kuramoto Could Say His Name. The Same Was True for the Personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He Said That He Felt Nothing But Hunger in His Stomach. When Asked If He Felt Happy About Returning to the City Now, Kuramoto Strenuously Said That He Did Not Want to Return and Said, "My Return Is Very Inappropriate." When Asked What He Planned to Do With His Wife and Children, He Said Casually, "They Have Their Own Way of Surviving." Looking at Kuramoto's Intention, From the Police Station Back to the Japanese Embassy, There Was No Special Interest. At 5:00 PM This Afternoon, He Was Handed Over to Suma, the Japanese Consul General, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Taken Back to the Japanese Consulate. Japanese Newspaper Reporters in Nanjing Are Still Not Allowed to Visit Kuramoto in the Japanese Consulate Because the People in the Consulate Said, "He Is Too Weak to Work Again." However, It Is Said That When Kuramoto Was on Zijin Mountain, He Went to the Foot of the Mountain to Buy Food, So He Did Not Seem to Be Physically Weak. In Addition, Foreign News Said That the Japanese Side Will Order Kuramoto to Send a Letter to Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Express His Apologies. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Central News Agency Reporters Learned That Kuramoto Was Found, They Immediately Bought a Car Out of the City to Explore Where He Was Hiding. When They Arrived at Ming Xiaoling, There Were Still Dozens of Police Officers Patrolling There, Everyone With a Tired Look on Their Faces, But Now With Happy Faces. When Asked Where Kuramoto Was Hiding, They Said That It Was Behind the Mountain, and It Would Be Difficult to Reach All Day Without Someone to Guide Them. At the Ming Xiaoling Sacrificial Hall, They Saw an Officer of the Military Police Headquarters, Leading a Bare-Chested Man, Preparing to Enter the City. This Person Was Wei Zongqing, the Mausoleum Garden Worker Who First Discovered Kuramoto. The Reporters Climbed the Mountain Led by Zhang Qihe, a Staff Member of the Mausoleum Garden, Climbing Up the Mausoleum. The Road Was Only Wide Enough for One Person, With Random Stones Protruding. They Walked for About a Li to the Top of the Tomb and Went Down Again. Wild Grasses Were Luxuriant and There Was No Road to Find. They Pushed Through the Grass and Advanced. After a Long Time, Under a Wild Soybean Tree, They Found Where He Was Hiding. This Place Was a Small Hole, Only Enough to Accommodate a Person's Body. The Head Had to Be Exposed Outside the Hole. The Hole Was Surrounded by Wild Soybeans and Wild Grasses, Like a Wild Animal's Nest. Kuramoto Took Leaves and Flattened the Bottom of the Hole and Lay in It. Kuramoto Had Another Cave for Resting During the Day, One Li Away, Also in a Place Rarely Visited. Our Military Police Finally Discovered It. Their Diligence and Hard Work Can Be Seen. Kuramoto Had Been Hiding for Five Days, Looking Haggard, With a Worried Look on His Face All Day Long, Looking Down With His Eyes, As If Unable to Bear the Sighs. He Needed Someone to Help Him Walk, Unable to Lift His Feet. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central News Agency Reporters Learned That the Person Who First Discovered Kuramoto on the Morning of the 13th Was Wei Zongqing, a Mausoleum Garden Worker. Because Kuramoto Had Been Living Alone in the Mountains for Several Days and Was Extremely Thirsty, He Went Down the Mountain to Find Water on the Morning of the 13th and Met Wei. Kuramoto Spoke Very Fluent Chinese. They Talked to Each Other. Wei Bought Four Chicken Eggs for Kuramoto to Fill His Stomach. After a While, Zhang Qihe, a Staff Member of the Mausoleum Garden, Saw the Situation and Also Went to Investigate, Suspecting That It Was Kuramoto. He Urgently Reported to the Military Police by Phone, and Kuramoto Was Found. Wei Zongqing Is From Suxian County in Southern Anhui, 33 Years Old, and Usually Works in the Mausoleum Garden, Earning a Few Corners of Wages a Day. He Has Now Been Taken to the Headquarters by the Military Police and Will Be Rewarded. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Reliable Sources, Kuramoto Went From His Residence to the Consulate at 10:30 PM on the Evening of the 8th, Intending to Go to Xiaguan to Send Arishima to Shanghai. Because the Car Was Full, He Did Not Get His Wish. Then, He Hired a Rickshaw, Reached Zhongshan Gate Along Zhongshan Road, and Gave the Rickshaw Puller a Silver Coin of Two Corners. Then, He Walked Up the Mountain Alone. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mr. Kuramoto, the Japanese Deputy Consul Who Went Missing Last Friday Evening, Was Found Asleep in the Forest Under Zijin Mountain Around 2:00 PM Today. The Finders Were Four Detectives. Mr. Kuramoto Was Mentally Disturbed. Because He Had Been Sleeping Outdoors for Several Days, He Was Quite Tired, But His Health Was Still Good. After Being Awakened by the Detectives, Kuramoto Initially Did Not Want to Return to Nanjing. After Repeated Persuasion, He Agreed to Return. It Was 3:00 PM. The Police Department Treated Him With Food. At 4:00 PM, a Reuters Reporter Went to See Him. Kuramoto Spoke Very Fluent Chinese and Described in Detail the Situation After His Disappearance, Saying That After 10:00 PM on the Evening of June 8, I Was at the Japanese Consulate General Preparing to Go to Xiaguan to See Japanese Ambassador Arishima Off, But the Car Was Very Crowded, So I Hired a Rickshaw and Went Along Zhongshan Road to the Mausoleum Garden. I Arrived at Zhongshan Gate at Midnight. The Rickshaw Puller Was Unwilling to Go Forward, So I Waved Him Away and Walked Out of the City. The Gatekeeper Did Not Stop Me. The Reuters Reporter Asked Him the Reason for This Strange Action. Kuramoto Initially Did Not Want to Say, But Then Said That When I Walked Out of Zhongshan Gate That Night, I Felt a Strange Feeling of Happiness and Satisfaction. I Walked Past the Mausoleum Garden and Climbed Zijin Mountain. I Looked Down at Nanjing From the Top of the Mountain and Saw the Electric Lights Flickering. I Waved My Hand and Said Goodbye to China's Beautiful Capital. The Wind on the Mountain Was Strong, Especially That Night. I Piled Up Stones to Build a Temporary Dwelling for Myself. I Did This Every Night. I Was Originally Determined to Abandon the World. Unfortunately, I Drank Water. Otherwise, I Wouldn't Be Here Now. The Reuters Reporter Told Him That Nanjing Was Very Happy to Hear That He Was Safe. Kuramoto Replied, "I Am Not Happy. Everyone Has Different Views on Life." The Reuters Reporter Told Him That His Wife and Children Would Be Happy to See Him Return. Kuramoto Replied, "They Can Take Care of Themselves." The Reuters Reporter Asked Him If He Was Hungry. Kuramoto Replied That He Did Not Feel Hungry After the Police Department Provided Him With Food. After the Conversation, Kuramoto Shook Hands With the Reuters Reporter to Say Goodbye. The Handshake Was Strong, But His Fingers Were Slightly Wet, Which Proved That His Nerves Were Not Calm. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Case of a Student Studying in Japan Being Brutally Murdered: Japanese Side's Evasive Words; Light Punishment for the Murderer Watanabe</h3>
<p>Nagasaki: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo made an unofficial announcement on the 12th regarding the brutal murder of Ye Muhua, a Chinese student studying in Nagasaki. However, the truth is as follows: On May 20th, at 12:25 PM, three students from the private Nichika Commercial School in Higashiyamamachi, Nagasaki City, were playing soccer in the street in front of the school. At that time, Ye Muhua, a Chinese student from Fuzhou, residing at 27 Shinchi, Nagasaki City, aged 19, was passing by. Watanabe Tatsuo, a student from the school, accidentally kicked the ball at Ye, and the two began to argue. Watanabe stabbed Ye in the chest with a short knife, and Ye immediately lost consciousness and died. The police arrested Watanabe and, after a thorough interrogation, punished him. However, the reason was that the two had been on bad terms for some time, and Ye insulted Watanabe, leading to the act of violence. However, this is merely a children's quarrel, completely different from the Kura Moto incident where a diplomat disappeared in the capital. (13th Dispatch from Dentsu)</p>

<h3>Mongolian Political Affairs Committee Striving to Carry Out Construction</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Bailing Temple stated that the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee is striving to carry out construction, such as surveying the population of Mongolians and the exact number of lamas, developing Inner Mongolian industry and commerce, and building roads between the various leagues and banners, all of which will be started in the shortest possible time. The security team is beginning to be organized. The Inner Mongolian authorities originally planned to organize a cavalry regiment, but due to various reasons, it was changed to a security team, and the number of personnel is not enough to form a regiment. The problem of the Japanese forcibly setting up a radio station in Prince Suo's mansion last year has now been resolved. Because Prince Suo at that time flew in 2,000 elite soldiers to gather at Prince Suo's mansion, the Japanese immediately withdrew. A portion of the expenses for the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee has been allocated in the past. If it cannot be allocated in the future, it will be planned locally. Currently, Wu Heling and others are still in Nanchang negotiating. The seals of the various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia are still using old objects from the Qing Dynasty.

He had a good impression of his trip to the south and said that everything requires hard work. There are no foreign affairs in Shandong, and the bandit atmosphere is gradually calming down, but there are still some bandits in the southeast, which is not a cause for concern.

<h3>38th Division Circular: Reports of Towns Being Captured Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The 38th Division's staff office issued a circular on the 12th, stating: "Recently, we read in the newspapers of Beijing and Tianjin that Sichuan telegrams reported that the Red bandits had retreated to southern Shaanxi and that Zhenba had been captured by bandits, which is extremely surprising. After investigation, it was found that Xu Xiangqian's gang in northern Henan attempted to disturb southern Shaanxi, which may be the case. However, in order to guard against any eventuality, our army has long been deployed and ready. The border areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi, such as Zhenba and Zichang counties, are all equipped with heavy troops and have strong fortifications. They are waiting to join forces with the Sichuan army to attack the bandits, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. These unfounded rumors are purely fabricated by traitors in an attempt to confuse public opinion, which is tantamount to propaganda for the bandits. However, the facts are there, and in due course, the people of the country will see the truth. "Letter from the 38th Division Staff Office in Hanzhong (12th) (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Future of the German and Italian Prime Ministers' Meeting</h3>
<p>— Respectfully</p>
<p>After the heads of state of Italy, Austria, and Hungary met in Rome, the situation in Europe suddenly changed. The slogan of economic cooperation was merely a superficial gesture; its actual effect lay in political understanding. In other words, it was to establish the foundation for Italy's hegemony in Central Europe. Germany, unable to fully succeed in Austria and failing to achieve its wish to tear up the Treaty of Versailles, and with its eastward expansion blocked by the united efforts of the Soviet Union and France, found itself in a diplomatic dilemma. Unwilling to condescend to return to the League of Nations, yet unable to fully exploit the contradictions among continental European nations to forge its own path, German diplomacy fell into a quagmire from which it was difficult to escape. Among European countries, only Italy shared similar interests and viewpoints with Germany. Before the understanding among Italy, Austria, and Hungary was established, an understanding between Italy and Germany would not be difficult, and even a joint effort against France was possible. This was because Italy was also dissatisfied with the Treaty of Versailles and had long advocated for reforming the League of Nations. Since the rapprochement between France and the Soviet Union, Germany had faced increasing restrictions on all sides, making Italy and Germany more inclined to approach each other. First, Italy and Germany were both anti-League of Nations forces, unwilling to let Britain and France control everything, and wanting to re-evaluate the balance of power in Europe. It was clear that if Germany could break free from the constraints of the treaty, Italy could use this to share hegemony in Central Europe and even expand its influence in North Africa. Although Italy and Germany had different fundamental positions, they shared the goal of destroying the shackles of the League of Nations. Second, Italy's army was not weaker than France's, but in terms of new weapons, especially the equipment of the air force and the foundation of mechanical industry, Italy could not compete with France. Its natural resources were also very scarce. Without strong external support and skillful use of diplomatic conflicts, it would be difficult for Italy to maintain its status as a major power. Germany, seeing the compromise between France and the Soviet Union and Britain's superficial observation, had to insist on its claim of equal military strength to encourage its national courage and enhance its international status. Italy, unable to compete with France, wanted to use Germany's strength to help itself. This was another reason why Italy and Germany could negotiate an agreement. With these two reasons, the two dictators had today's meeting in Venice. We do not need to predict the specific content of the talks, as the general idea can be gleaned from previous consultations among the three countries. Apart from the above two points, it is difficult to form a more powerful action to break the current situation in Europe.</p>
<p>The reason Austria abandoned its kinship with Germany in terms of race and language and became close to Italy was that the German National Socialist Party was too reckless, causing embarrassment to figures like Dollfuss. At the same time, Germany was unable to provide Austria with a maritime outlet, causing its economic panic and hindering its early recovery. This led to the understanding among Italy, Austria, and Hungary, creating a semblance of an economic alliance. If the meeting between Mussolini and Hitler does not involve political and economic issues, it will be fine. However, if it touches on political and economic relations, the Austrian-Hungarian question will immediately become a current obstacle, further stimulating the sharp opposition between the two extreme nationalistic states. Both want to use Austria as a satellite to compete for hegemony in Central Europe, and with France mediating between them, the problem becomes even more complicated. Regarding relations with the Soviet Union, based on the superficial situation between Italy and Germany, there should not be much conflict. However, today's Germany, unable to actively compete with France, must find a way to break through its surrounding weaknesses to develop its national strength. Therefore, adopting an aggressive stance towards the Soviet Union is almost inevitable. In pure theory, Italy may agree with this, but in reality, would it really want Germany to develop as much as possible? Before World War I, Italy was originally a member of the Allied Powers, but later joined the Entente and became an enemy of Germany. The past serves as a lesson. Therefore, Italy and Germany cannot avoid being wary of each other, especially regarding relations with the Soviet Union. Moreover, since the small countries in the Danube River region expressed dissatisfaction with France, Italy intends to take the opportunity to advance and establish its hegemony in Central Europe. Germany is also eager to get involved and would not allow Italy to dominate alone. This is another factor that prevents Italy and Germany from coordinating. Therefore, the cooperation between Italy and Germany can only break the current situation in Europe to a certain extent, and the rest will still be mutually opposed.</p>
<h3>Our Country Implements Factory Law; Concession Authorities Obstruct</h3>
<p>Representative Li Submits to the International Labor Organization</p>
<p>Industrial Development Targeted in Four Years</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the meeting of the International Labour Office, Mr. Li, the acting representative of China, stated today while discussing the report of the board of directors that the Chinese government recently intended to implement the Factory Law of 1929 and sent personnel to investigate and supervise the working conditions in factories in the concessions. However, the concession authorities refused, which is a great act of divergence, as the concessions are still Chinese land. Mr. Li also mentioned that the Chinese government has formulated a three-year plan to place unemployed workers in road construction and other projects. The Chinese government also seeks industrial development and plans to implement a four-year plan with 620 million yuan. Five large factories have now been established. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>The Two Ruthless Italian and German Leaders Meet in Venice Today; Heart-to-Heart Talks on Major Issues at the Palazzo Pisani; Austrian Situation and Disarmament are Focuses of Discussion; Hitler Arrives by Plane This Morning; Italian Ships Gather in the Adriatic Sea to Show Respect</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Mussolini of Rome and Chancellor Hitler of Germany are scheduled to begin their meeting on the 14th at the Palazzo Pisani in Stra, between Padua and Venice. Most of the Italian representatives participating in the meeting have already departed for Venice tonight. Hitler will come by plane with Foreign Minister Neurath and will arrive on Thursday morning. German Ambassador to Italy Hassell will also participate at that time. Prime Minister Mussolini is currently in Cordenons and will go directly to the meeting place from there. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Note: Venice was a republic from 697 to 1797. This time, when Hitler visits, celebrations will be held here to commemorate the prosperity of the Venetian Republic.</p>
<p>Rome: German Chancellor Hitler will arrive in Venice tomorrow. However, it is generally believed that Italian newspapers are criticizing France's policies in anticipation of his meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Ten Italian warships have gathered in the lagoon west of the Gulf of Venice to show respect. The two prime ministers will meet at the Palazzo Pisani in Stra, ten miles west of Venice. The mansion formerly belonged to a noble family, and Napoleon once resided here when he drove the Austrians out of the city. In front of it is a large square surrounded by ancient trees. When the two prime ministers discuss world affairs in the mansion, no outsiders will be able to observe them, as police and plainclothes officers will be stationed around the mansion. Hitler will travel with Foreign Minister Neurath and is expected to arrive by plane at 9:30 tomorrow morning. Mussolini and others will greet him at the airfield on the outskirts of the city and prepare a grand banquet to welcome the two guests. In the afternoon and evening, the two prime ministers will discuss everything at the Palazzo Pisani. On Friday morning, the meetings will continue. Italian Undersecretary Suvich will host a luncheon for Hitler and Neurath at the Lido Dance Club at noon. Hitler will host a banquet at his hotel in the evening for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and others. When the two prime ministers meet, the Italian side will include Undersecretary Suvich, Italian representative to the League of Nations Aloisi, Italian Ambassador to Germany Cerruti, and Fascist Party Secretary Starace. The German side will include Foreign Minister Neurath and German Ambassador to Italy Hassell. Roman authorities remain silent on the issues to be discussed, and newspapers have not carried any news. It is heard that this meeting was initiated by Berlin, and Mussolini only agreed to it when he saw that the Geneva Conference was about to fail. Disarmament and Germany's return to the reorganized League of Nations are certainly on the agenda, but the situation in Austria seems to be a matter of great concern to both sides. Mussolini will advocate that Germany no longer assist the Austrian National Socialist Party, and Hitler seems likely to reiterate that Germany does not want to achieve the union of Germany and Austria by force.

<h3>Italian Newspapers Constantly Criticize France's Group Policy, Saying it Poses a Major Threat to Europe</h3>
<p>Rome: After the Franco-British-American compromise plan was established at the Disarmament Conference on the 8th of this month, the Italian press launched a propaganda campaign, saying that the European situation was controlled by France's "group" policy. Now that the two Italian and German prime ministers are about to meet, Italian newspapers continue to conduct this propaganda, saying that France's "group" policy is a threat to Europe, and its result will lead to the confrontation of other groups. Although Italian newspapers claim that they have never heard of the meeting between the two Italian and German leaders, their intention is to create an atmosphere in advance. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Shipbuilding Plan Causes Great Anxiety in Britain, Fearing it Will Affect Next Year's Naval Reduction Conference</h3>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Cesser suggested in the House of Commons today that Italy should be asked to postpone its decision to immediately build two 35,000-ton battleships, as this move may make it impossible for the 1935 Naval Conference to agree to reduce the existing tonnage by one level. Secretary of the Navy Monsell replied that he hoped that all relevant technical issues would be discussed during the preliminary talks between the two sides to be held soon. All countries that signed the Washington and London Naval Treaties have been invited to participate in these talks. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Expansion Plan: Adding 600 Aircraft Within One Year, Training Pilots, and Increasing Squadrons to Compete with France</h3>
<p>(London) British Privy Council member Baldwin recently stated that if a disarmament restriction agreement cannot be reached, Britain will try to catch up with the world's largest air force in the shortest possible time. Based on this proposal, the Aviation Department is now planning to expand the British Air Force and will submit it to the Cabinet meeting soon. It is heard that this new plan proposes to increase the number of air force squadrons by 50. In other words, 600 aircraft will be added within one year, 20 new airfields will be added, and the number of aviation personnel will be greatly increased. The UK has 800 first-line aircraft and about 130 second-line aircraft, excluding 100 aircraft in India. If expanded in the future, the UK air force will roughly be able to compete with France. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, the aircraft construction plan currently being prepared in the UK plans to build 100 to 150 aircraft in the first year, and then add more aircraft each year depending on national defense needs. If France remains the strongest air force in the world, the ultimate goal of the UK's construction of the air force will always be to reach the same level as France. Extensive propaganda is now being carried out to encourage people to become airline pilots. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>Two of Malta's newest British cruisers, the HMS Curlew and the HMS Arethusa, suddenly collided here today during naval, land and air force maneuvers. The hulls of both ships were damaged and have been put into dry dock for repairs. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japan Emphasizes the Air Force; Army Minister Hayashi Inspects the Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi is scheduled to depart from Tokyo on the 15th to inspect the Kakamigahara and Hamamatsu Nagato Regiments, as the expansion costs of the air force unit will be included in next year's budget. Therefore, preparations are being made in advance. After the Manchurian Incident, the army improved part of its air force through temporary expenses and equipment improvement expenses. However, compared to other countries, the number of aircraft in the Japanese army is very inferior, with only 800 aircraft and one anti-aircraft artillery regiment. It is planned to request defense facility expenses and fixed expenses for air defense flight teams next year. The authorities are currently drafting a plan, and once a plan is completed, it will be negotiated with the government. (Den-tsu, 12th)</p>
<h3>Not Deceived by the Japanese; Mexico Refuses to Recognize the Puppet State; The Estrada Doctrine Does Not Apply</h3>
<p>Mexico: The Associated Press correspondent learned today that Mexico has not been induced by Japan and has refused to recognize "Manchukuo". It is said that the Japanese Minister to Mexico, based on the Estrada Doctrine, strongly urged Mexico to recognize "Manchukuo". The Estrada Doctrine stipulates that Mexico recognizes friendly countries, regardless of how the country was established. According to reliable sources, Mexican government officials told the Japanese minister that the Estrada Doctrine only applies to established countries, and "Manchukuo", as a newly emerging country, is not within the scope of recognition. The Estrada Doctrine was advocated three years ago by Mr. Estrada, the former governor of Mexico (Estrada is currently the ambassador to Spain). At that time, coups broke out in Central and South American countries, and the situation was turbulent, making Mexico's position difficult. Therefore, the doctrine was advocated.

<h3>Honolulu Meeting; Japan Seeks to Realize It; Hirota Instructs the US Ambassador to Inquire About the Truth; and Hopes Roosevelt Will Visit Tokyo</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that US President Roosevelt plans to meet with influential Japanese figures in Honolulu this summer to exchange views. As the Naval Disarmament Conference is about to be held, Foreign Minister Hirota believes that it is necessary for Japan and the United States to have an understanding. On the afternoon of the 12th, he specifically sent a telegram to Ambassador Saito in the United States, instructing him to confirm this news. (Nichi-ren, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Foreign Minister Hirota received the report that President Roosevelt intended to meet with Japanese politicians in Honolulu, he immediately telegraphed Ambassador Saito to inquire whether it was true. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that a frank talk between the top politicians of Japan and the United States would have a significant peaceful effect. Therefore, it welcomes its realization. It is rumored that Foreign Minister Hirota has revealed to his aides that if the US government formally invites him, he himself intends to go. Furthermore, if President Roosevelt agrees, he will follow the old wisdom of General Grant in previous years and formally propose to invite President Roosevelt to visit Tokyo, which would be even more meaningful. This matter is also under consideration. (Den-tsu, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Naval Disarmament Preparatory Conference will be held next week to discuss quality issues. The Japanese Navy intends to send experts to participate in the conference. However, due to the lack of time, it has been decided to order Rear Admiral Hong Taifu, the Japanese naval representative currently in Geneva, to rush to London to attend and assist Ambassador Matsudaira in his work with Naval Attaché Oka Arata.

<h3>The US Once Again Cables Britain; War Debts Can Be Renegotiated; Requests Britain to Submit New Suggestions; and Allows Debt Repayment in Goods</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States delivered a cable to Britain today regarding war debts, requesting that new suggestions be submitted. This shows that the United States clearly wants to reopen all war debt negotiations based on a new position. The cable is only a response to Britain's statement of suspending war debt payments. Secretary of State Hull personally handed it to British Ambassador Lindsay. It states that the United States welcomes Britain's suggestion of paying off debts with goods. Observers indicate that the right to pay off debts with goods may be extended to other debtor nations. If so, the entire war debt problem will be completely changed. Hull said that he had also received a cable from France. Although the content of the cable has not been made public, France has also formally notified its decision to suspend the war debts due on June 15. In his cable to Ambassador Lindsay, Hull said that the United States is very willing to informally discuss any suggestions from the British government. Although there has been no discussion of paying off debts with goods before, such suggestions, if beneficial to both countries, can be discussed at length for submission to Congress for approval. Hull also asked Britain to pay attention to President Roosevelt's message to Congress. Observers here generally believe that the United States' new action is a wise step. The cable will lead to negotiations for the United States to accept British rubber, tin, ingots, and other goods that the United States lacks. Secretary of State Hull and the French Ambassador to the United States are unwilling to criticize the French cable. However, a cable from France stated that the French Cabinet had decided to continue the suspension of payments, so the French cable formally notified the suspension of payments, which is beyond doubt. Belgium and Czechoslovakia also cabled the State Department yesterday, suspending debts due on Friday. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The possibility of repaying debts with goods mentioned in the American war debt message is attracting great attention here, especially because it represents a more conciliatory attitude on the part of the US government. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Since the American statement on war debts agreeing to accept goods in lieu of cash was released, the stock exchanges yesterday evening and today have shown a marked improvement. The American statement is seen as very important because (1) it contains formal American recognition of the difficulty of repayment, and (2) it offers hope of solving the war debt problem by substituting cash with tin, rubber, manganese, and whiskey. However, this kind of transaction may cause serious disturbances in the foreign exchange market, which will result in (1) a more stable dollar price, which the American authorities do not want, and (2) disrupting the balance of the British imperial currency, as the British government must purchase and sell tin and other goods from various parts of the empire. Some people speculate that due to the above-mentioned difficulties and because Finance Minister Chamberlain believes that Britain's repayment of American war debts should depend on whether various governments repay British war debts, the British government may not be happy with the idea of substituting goods for cash.

<p>(Paris) The French government's decision to refuse to repay a portion of the war debt owed to the United States when it becomes due on the 15th of this month has been approved by the French cabinet today, and it has been decided to send a cable to Washington tomorrow.

(National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government has prepared an official document regarding the war debt issue due on June 15 this year, which has been telegraphed to the French Ambassador to the United States, de Laboulaye, instructing him to forward it to the US government. The document states that the French government maintains the legal view of the French Chamber of Deputies' decision of December 14, 1932 regarding war debts, that is, since Germany has stopped paying France, France cannot repay debts to the United States either. Since December 14 of that year, although various events have occurred, the French government has always adhered to the view of the French Chamber of Deputies. It is heard that de Laboulaye will deliver this document to the US government before June 15. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Netherlands and Belgium Maintain the Gold Standard</h3>

<p>Brussels: After the formation of the new government of Mr. de Broqueville in Belgium, most of the newspapers' comments are lukewarm. The semi-official Belgica News Agency said that the industrial and commercial sectors are quite welcome to the new government, believing that the organization of the new cabinet is enough to prove Belgium's determination to maintain the gold standard. Therefore, "the market value of various public bonds has risen, and the closing of the Belgian franc against the foreign exchange market is also below the gold export point," and so on.

<h3>Yugoslavia is Willing to Devote Itself to Peace; Foreign Minister Delivers a Speech in Paris</h3>

<h3>Central vs. Local: Spain's Serious Situation - Catalonia to Declare Republic, Central Government to Stop by Force</h3>
<p>The situation between the autonomous region of Catalonia in Barcelona and the central Spanish government has become serious due to the new Catalan land law. Today, troops here are gathered in military camps awaiting orders, and public institutions are protected by soldiers. The only topic of general discussion is the possibility of Catalonia declaring a republic. Today, crowds gathered in front of the parliament, shouting "Long live the Republic, Down with the traitors!" The Spanish flag hanging in the parliament has been removed. The president of the Catalan autonomous region addressed the crowd, saying that the central government will use force to prevent the implementation of the new land law. It is reported that the land law recently passed by the Catalan parliament cancels the contracts concluded between tenants and landlords regarding land taxes, etc., which are generally paid by the tenants. This plan was later deemed invalid by the central government's court. As a result, thirty-six Catalan members withdrew from the National Assembly, claiming that if the central government did not change its attitude, they would no longer enter the National Assembly. Catalonia includes the four provinces of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida, and Girona. According to the law passed by the Spanish National Assembly on September 9, 1932, an autonomous region can be established within Spain, with a parliament and an executive council, independently managing education, economy, society, and police affairs within the region. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>The leaders of the Spanish constitutional faction in Madrid are striving to extend the life of the cabinet and enable the parliament to continue until December next year. Robert, the right-wing leader who controls the parliament, admitted this to an Associated Press interviewer, saying, "We must do our best to clear the thorns of the current government so that we can form a majority party government in the fall. Only a government supported by the majority party in parliament can solve economic and social problems." Robert believes that the current parliament may not be able to continue until December 1935. Robert indicated that since the right-wing controls the parliament, there is a risk that the parliament will be dissolved at any time. It is heard that Robert will succeed Zapote as Prime Minister.

<h3>Disturbances in Austria</h3>
<p>The terrorist activities of the National Socialist Party members within Austria are planned and presided over by Berlin and Munich. The Austrian government now has solid evidence in hand. Today, two National Socialist Party members were arrested while preparing to load a car with a large amount of extremely powerful explosives and fuses, intending to transport them to Innsbruck. These explosives are unprecedented in Austria. The boxes containing the explosives were labeled "Inspection Office of the Ministry of National Defense, Berlin," indicating that the explosives were shipped from Germany, which is beyond doubt. In addition, high-voltage power lines in some areas were destroyed by bombs. (Havas News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Vienna's official gazette officially announced that multiple terrorist activities have been uncovered, all committed by National Socialist Party members. Some are being planned, and some have already been implemented.

<h3>British Colonies Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(London) The Governor of Malta has also ordered the implementation of import quotas for foreign cotton and rayon fabrics from May 7 to December 31. Quotas for Japanese goods have been established. In addition, the Legislative Council of British West Africa's Nigeria has passed various bills that stipulate quotas for boycotting Japanese goods. Members believe that this is a moral assistance to Britain, as the various plans do not include any features to protect the local products. Since these people are suffering from low product prices, they will be forced to buy expensive foreign goods in the future. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Signs Reciprocal Tariff Act</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt signed the Reciprocal Tariff Act today. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement saying that the act aims to revitalize international trade based on the principle of reciprocity. Hull hopes that international stability can be fully achieved so that all countries can restore past trade. Hull also stated that the act will eventually equalize currencies and improve the international financial structure. Although Hull's statement expressed optimism, it is generally believed here that if there is no hope of breaking the war debt stalemate, the value of negotiating reciprocal tariffs with various countries will be greatly diminished, as the act does not mention the cancellation or reduction of war debts. Therefore, if the United States conducts reciprocal negotiations with debtor countries, the debtor countries will take the opportunity to demand a reduction in war debts. The act authorizes the President to directly negotiate commercial treaties with foreign countries and modify tariffs based on these treaties. According to recent information, the act will reduce taxes on some imported goods, but the President still signed the act. Those affected by the act include automobiles, trucks, foot-operated vehicles, wood, wood products, books, and coal. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Central Meteorological Research Institute to Build Three More Observatories</h3>

Wu and Wang have been sent to Lhasa with instruments. Wu and Wang have arrived in Xining and are trying to detour to Lhasa.

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Discusses Shanghai Municipal Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Tiecheng talked about: (1) There has been no special progress recently in the negotiations on Shanghai's recovery of road rights outside the concessions.

<h3>Disaster Situation in Hengfeng County | The Provincial Relief Committee Sends Personnel to Inspect |</h3>
<p>Hekou Correspondence: Among the counties in eastern Jiangxi that have fallen to banditry, Hengfeng is the most deeply affected. In the winter of the 16th year of the Republic of China, bandits Fang and Shao launched an uprising, and Ge Yuan Town and the county seat were successively lost, and the entire territory was red. Recently, the 21st Army of the National Army recovered Hengfeng County.

He arrived in Hekou on May 30. When the Hengfeng County Government heard the news, they sent Tong Section to Hekou to negotiate and expressed their welcome. Inspector Min then went to Hengfeng, passing through villages along the way, inspecting each one in detail. A desolate scene of weeds and broken walls was unbearable to witness. After arriving at the county seat, County Magistrate Xie and Wang Instructor of the 21st Army's Training and Political Office led him to inspect the disaster situation in the urban and suburban areas. The next morning, he went to the disaster victims' homes to express his condolences one by one, and then went to the temporary rehabilitation committee for investigation. Then he went to the 21st Army Headquarters to meet with Commander Liang to discuss the relief situation. He immediately returned to Hekou to report the actual situation of the Hengfeng disaster to the provincial government, the disaster relief committee, and Chairman Wen for instructions. Attached is the telegram as follows: "On the order of this month, I went to Hengfeng from Hekou on the 2nd to inspect the disaster situation. Passing through the villages, the roads were covered with weeds, there were no residents in the houses, and the dilapidated and destroyed state was extremely tragic. After entering the city, the fields and gardens became barren land, and seven or eight out of ten houses were burned. Those who survived had no doors and no walls, and it was impossible to find a table or a chair to rest on. Recently, several refugees have returned and surrendered, mostly with no clothes to cover their bodies and no food to eat, looking emaciated and starving. Hengcheng has just been recovered and has no resources for relief. Even neighboring counties such as Raoyan and Yi are areas affected by banditry and have no time to care for their neighbors. For the sake of appeasing the people, it is necessary to telegraph Your Excellency to allocate relief funds and send personnel to set up a reception center to comfort those who have returned. Otherwise, the refugees will have nowhere to beg and the wandering masses will hear and stop. It is very worrying. Is there anything appropriate? I am waiting for your instructions." (5th)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Bandits Surrender, Claiming Internal Disintegration; Inspector Suggests Developing Transportation to Liu Chengfu; the More Transportation is Advanced, the More Difficult Transport Becomes, Sharing Similarities with the Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi; Steady and Solid Progress is the Only Unchanging Principle in Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Chengdu Dispatch. The military operations to suppress bandits in Sichuan Province are progressing rapidly. Recently, the bandits have been increasingly disintegrating and living in constant fear.</p>
<p>The supplies in Dehan City have gradually moved towards the Bashan Mountains, indicating their intention to flee into the mountains. This shows their final desperate struggle and that they are in their last throes. It is expected that the suppression of these bandits is just around the corner after the start of the fourth phase of the general offensive. Recently, many have returned from the front lines to surrender. From the 3rd Division, 9th Brigade, several bandits, including Qiao Yulong and Yang Fatang, surrendered with their weapons. They claimed that there is a Wangjiaba within the Liangzi Mountains of Bashan, which serves as the bandits' general hospital, housing over ten thousand seriously wounded. The number of lightly wounded is countless. They also stated that the old bandits from other provinces are very wary of the new bandits from Sichuan, prohibiting them from whispering or walking in groups of three. Each guard post has "old countrymen" (口號 - their motto) from other provinces monitoring them. Therefore, the Sichuan people among the bandits are suffering unspeakably, and everyone wants to revolt but lacks the opportunity. Our defection and escape were also fortunate successes. According to what we know, the number of those killed for wanting to revolt is no less than a thousand. This is enough to know that the internal disintegration of the bandits is not difficult to eliminate. However, due to the high mountains and dangerous terrain in the Tongba area, the roads are difficult to travel, and all kinds of transportation are challenging, causing military delays. This is the reason why Inspector Luo Shuchang of the Fifth Route and Inspector Shuzhi of the Sixth Route saw this and telegraphed General Commander Liu Xiang, offering suggestions on developing transportation and preventing bandit conspiracies. Liu Xiang greatly appreciated it. The original text of their suggestion stated, "Transportation is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In peacetime, it facilitates the circulation of goods, promotes culture, transmits politics, and prospers the local area. In wartime, it facilitates military transport, quickens the flow of information, supplements military opportunities, and reduces labor costs. The various benefits are truly difficult to fully enumerate. In the recent situation in eastern Sichuan, if there were convenient transportation, then the small area of Tongjiang and Wanyuan would have been swept clean of bandits long ago, gathering and annihilating them. Why would we be constrained and affect progress? Although each route is winning step by step, the more we advance, the more difficult transportation becomes. Despite spending tens of thousands of dollars on labor and materials every day, the army at the front is still struggling to sustain its food supply. This is the same problem as the past failure of bandit suppression in Jiangxi, which was caused by the inconvenience of transportation. For more than a year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has firmly advocated the principle of steady and solid progress. Whenever a position is captured, transportation is immediately established along with it. The actual benefits are not superficial. Compared to the labor costs of the civilians, it cannot be measured in miles. Moreover, from now on, for ten or a hundred years, the people will forever enjoy its benefits, and the utility of local products is secondary. Sichuan is a land of abundance. All of the province's hundred-plus counties are fertile areas, especially the Tongba area, bordering Shaanxi. The terrain is naturally dangerous. Zhang Xianzhong, Wang Sanhuai, and their ilk successively occupied it to cause chaos in Shu. The historical scars are still there, all because transportation was inconvenient, making it difficult to suppress them, and this contributed to it. It is proposed to instruct the highway bureaus to strive for the development of transportation in eastern Sichuan. The section from Wanxian to Xuanhan should be built quickly to benefit bandit suppression. After the bandits are cleared, the section connecting Tongba should be built. This will solve the problem once and for all, remove obstacles, make it difficult for bandits to hide, and bring endless blessings to the local area for generations to come. It is also heard that the bandits have sent people to instigate our military laborers to riot and to supplement our soldiers to create internal chaos. If this is true, the rear is truly worrying, and the front will also be significantly affected. It is requested to instruct all departments and supply stations to pay special attention, conduct strict investigations and defenses, and carry out party purification work in each county to eliminate hidden dangers. It is also heard that due to the hot weather along the supply lines, porters are dying every day. If more medical personnel can be sent, carrying medicines, to provide timely relief at each supply station, it will prevent the reduction of transportation capacity, and the future will rely on it."</p>
<h3>Kailuan Majiagou Coal Mine Labor Strike Occurs; Workers Strike Because Reduced Work Affects Livelihood; Settled After Mediation</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch. The Kailuan mines have been troubled in recent years. The Tangshan mine strike almost became unmanageable. Just over a month after it was settled, incidents occurred again at the Tangjiazhuang and Majiagou mines. The Majiagou mine workers went on strike at 12:00 AM on June 8th. The cause of the strike was that the mine bureau reduced workers' working hours to control output and prevent surpluses. The workers went on strike because their income was insufficient to maintain their livelihood, demanding the restoration of the original working hours. Originally, the Majiagou mine had over a thousand workers, producing about 2,300 to 3,000 tons of coal per day. This year, the sales of Kailuan coal outside the pass were affected by the arbitrary imposition of tariffs by the puppet state. Even the Jinxi and Xingcheng areas could not transport coal to within the war zone. Furthermore, due to the intrusion of the puppet Beipiao coal and Fushun coal, the sales along the Yangtze River were also squeezed by the dumping of Fushun coal. Sales were not as good as before. Since spring, there has been a large amount of coal in stock. To avoid surpluses, the mine management specifically controlled production, intending to restore the original production of each mine after the stored coal was sold off, starting with the Majiagou mine. Production was reduced from 2,300 tons to 400 tons per day. The workers were originally contract workers, earning more wages when they produced more coal. Since the amount of coal produced was reduced, their income naturally decreased. The workers calculated that their income was insufficient to maintain their lives. Two days ago, they contacted the labor liaison office newly established by the mine bureau in the mine area, requesting a return to normal. The mine bureau ignored their request and did not reply. By 12:00 AM on the 8th, the workers could no longer endure it and went on strike during the shift change. The order was still good after the strike. The mine inside and outside was protected by the mine area's second security team. The mine bureau was informed the next morning and immediately sent Secretary Zhang Guanru to mediate. Zhang arrived at the mine at 3:30 PM on the 9th. At the same time, Li Yinchun, the resident inspector of the Industry Department in Tangshan, also rushed to the city to mediate with the workers. Apart from the previous request, the workers had no other conditions. Zhang Guanru reported this to the mine bureau. The mine bureau believed that the Tangjiazhuang mine had not fully resumed work, and the Majiagou mine could not have another strike, which would reduce the total amount of coal produced. Therefore, it was handled according to the contract agreement and restored the amount of work that the workers should do. The workers were satisfied and returned to work at 12:00 AM on the 9th. Although a small number of workers did not immediately return to work, it was due to private disagreements with the contractors, not related to the mine bureau. Therefore, in fact, the mine had returned to peace after the strike. The incident at the Tangjiazhuang mine was at the end of last month, when the mine's power generator caught fire, burning the second coal mine. After a week of repairs, coal has been produced. However, production has been reduced by two-thirds. A few days ago, the water pump in the third coal mine suddenly broke, and water poured out like a waterfall, flooding the mine. More than a hundred workers working inside were killed, and dozens were injured. The water in the mine was eight or nine feet deep. Technicians have been supervising the work to pump water out for days, but it has not been completely pumped out. The third coal mine cannot produce coal in a short time. The entire Tangjiazhuang mining area has a total of three tunnels. Now two of them have been destroyed. The coal seam in the first tunnel is almost exhausted, and there is not much production per day. Therefore, the entire mine is currently equivalent to being abandoned, and the mine management has suffered significant losses. (10th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang, Sheshan Robbery Injures Neighbors</h3>
<p>Robbery cases in the four townships of this county occur from time to time. Yesterday (the 12th) at about 9:00 PM, at the home of Jiang Xinyuan, across the river from the Yejiafen cemetery about half a mile south of Sheshan, suddenly four or five bandits speaking with a Hakka accent arrived, holding firearms. During the robbery, the village dogs barked wildly, alerting the neighbors, who got up to investigate. Knowing that the Jiang family was being robbed, they quickly beat gongs to warn others. The bandits, relying on their guns, were not afraid at all and continued to rob as usual. When Shen Shunzhou and Shen Wang Asan, a woman, went to peep in front of the Jiang family's door, they were seen by the bandits, angering them. The bandits fired shots, hitting Shen Shunzhou in the right waist and his wife in the right arm. They fled in pain, and the bandits chased them but fortunately missed. By the time they got home, they were covered in blood and breathing rapidly. Shen Shunzhou's injuries were severe. After the bandits left, the neighbors gathered to watch and then transported them to Songjiang to receive treatment at the Ruoshe Hospital.</p>
<h3>Kunshan, Chief of Public Security Bureau Changes</h3>
<p>Hua Shijun, the Chief of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, has only been in office for nine months. He has now received an order from the provincial government to be transferred to the province. His vacated position will be filled by Hu Xingbo. After receiving the order, Hua has instructed his subordinates to rush to complete the handover. It is heard that the new Chief Hu is scheduled to arrive in Kunshan on the 20th to take over.</p>
<h3>Fire Brigade Members Clash with Patrol Officers</h3>
<p>The fire fighting efforts in this county have always been well-developed. The reason is that the members of the fire brigades in each district are all volunteers. Whenever there is a fire, they rush forward bravely. Therefore, the people of all circles have deep faith in the fire brigades. Whenever purchasing equipment, they donate enthusiastically. Therefore, the equipment of the fire brigades in each district is mostly excellent. At 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th, a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Shen Zilan in Houbang due to carelessness. Members of the fire brigades in each district heard the alarm and drove to the rescue one after another. Fortunately, it was extinguished quickly. When the members of the fire brigade in the west district heard the alarm, they were late because of the long distance. The patrol officers blamed them for being late. The members were not convinced, leading to a quarrel. Both sides fought. A member was beaten by a patrol officer, arousing public anger. They dragged the fire engines into the Public Security Bureau. Afterwards, the audience numbered in the thousands, and the voices were boiling. Zhang Ruifu, the inspector of the Public Security Bureau, feared that the situation would escalate and urgently invited Li Jie, the chairman of the Fire Brigade Federation, to the bureau. He asked Li to persuade the members to drag the fire engines back, promising to investigate the patrol officer who caused the incident and punish him severely. After Li's persuasion, the members dragged the fire engines back. Today, the Federation convened a meeting to discuss negotiation methods.</p>

<h3>Wuxi, Military Officer Who Embezzled Funds Arrested in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wang Mengting, a supply officer with the rank of major in the Second Regiment of the Jiangxi Nanchang Tax Police, a native of Suzhou, absconded with 850 yuan in salary and two orderlies, Wang Xiaosan, last month. After the regiment commander discovered the incident, he immediately telegraphed the public security bureaus of Beijing and Shanghai to arrest him. After leaving Jiangxi, Wang Mengting took Wang Xiaosan by ship to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Wang Xiaosan suddenly stole the salary and fled. Wang Mengting was extremely frustrated. After arriving in Shanghai, he heard that Shanghai had received a telegram from Nanchang and knew that it was difficult to gain a foothold. He fled to this county the day before yesterday and stayed at the No. 1 Hotel on Tongyun Road. The public security bureau of this county had also received a telegram requesting the arrest. After learning that Wang was staying at the No. 1 Hotel, they sent detective Wang Shuanglin and others to the address and arrested Wang Mengting and took him to the bureau. Zhang, the section chief of the Third Section, interrogated him in court and ordered him to be temporarily detained to await the arrival of officials to bring him back to justice.</p>

<h3>Rural Woman Commits Suicide by Ingesting Opium</h3>
<p>Wu Zhongda, 30 years old, a resident of the Wu Zhongda of the Shuiqueli area near Houqiao Town in the Ninth District, opened a brothel in Shanghai. In his youth, he hired Shao Qiaosheng, a tailor from Anzhen, to marry his daughter Gendi. They married in 1929. Gendi lived in the countryside, and Wu took a concubine in Shanghai, neglecting his wife's livelihood. In recent years, Wu has shrunk his brothel and changed it to a hotel, but he was not good at business and suffered huge losses, leading to bankruptcy. Gendi, facing a broken livelihood, suddenly had the idea of suicide and secretly ingested raw opium yesterday afternoon. After being discovered by neighbors, a doctor was called to provide emergency treatment, but it was too late. She died in the evening. Shao Qiaosheng, the woman's father, heard the news and launched a major protest, intending to report to the local branch to request an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Nantong, Gang of Bandits Defeated on Nantong Coast</h3>
<p>On the coast of Jiangbei's Nantong, a large gang of Haizhou bandits invaded, and the situation was extremely rampant. The Provincial Security Department telegraphed Shen Yishan, the captain of the maritime guerrilla team, ordering him to lead his troops to suppress them. Shen's troops set out from Fengjue and sunk two bandit ships. The remaining bandits fled north.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang, Large Quantity of Opium Confiscated in Xialiuwei</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Huangpu ship arrived near Xialiuwei Port in the Seventh District and threw two bags of opium, weighing 66 and a half catties (approximately 40 kilograms). A water patrol boat from the Public Security Bureau was protecting it nearby. Just as they were about to retrieve it, a patrol boat from the Provincial Maritime Public Security Third Detachment, stationed in Bajiwei Port, arrived to investigate. A conflict broke out, and gunfire was exchanged. The opium traffickers Tian Juquan (aka Tian Jingan), Liu Yu (aka Liu Xueyi, chief of the Public Security Bureau patrol), Zhang Heqing (aka Zhang Zhilian, patrol officer of the Public Security Bureau), and a No. 2 box gun (number 2111) and two bags of opium were seized by the water police. The two sides were in a stalemate. Chen Xingya, the patrol officer of the county water patrol team, immediately sent a police officer to report to the General Bureau. Director Zhang led twelve armed police officers to the scene at 3:00 AM that night, and the personnel and contraband were placed under custody at the Seventh District Office. All the officials of the district office mediated for an entire night before a resolution was reached. 49 and a half catties of opium and Tian Juquan were handed over to the county government. The rest was ignored. The county government was unaware of the details and detained Tian Juquan and confiscated the opium.</p>
<h3>Haimen, Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits in Tianbu Township</h3>
<p>Zhou Zengchuan, the captain of the First Battalion of the Guard Regiment, and Jing Bo, the chief of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, jointly led twenty members of the regiment and police on patrol at the border between the First and Second Districts at 2:00 AM yesterday (11th). When they arrived west of the Wu Shaoshi store in Tianbu Township in the Second District, more than ten robbers suddenly came face to face. The regiment and police shouted for them to stop, and the robbers immediately opened fire. The regiment and police returned fire. For a moment, the sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of firecrackers, and bullets fell like rain. Before long, the robbers suddenly shouted "not good" and fled southeast in droves. The night was still dark, and reeds grew densely along the road, so the regiment and police did not dare to pursue them, fearing an ambush. When they advanced to the original location of the robbers, they saw two bandits dead after being shot. Villagers identified them as Shi Zhiqiu and Huang Yunxian, both living in Jiusi Township in the First District. A box gun with eleven bullets and a large flashlight were found on Shi's body. Ten handgun bullets and a洋燭 (wax candle) were found in Huang's pocket. They continued to search the homes of Shi and Huang, but their families had fled. Thirty-six box gun bullets and 13 pieces of clothing and bedding and a wallet were found separately. Yuan Wenhuan, Zhang Guanchou, Ni Baoxiang, and three other suspects were arrested near Dalian Township in the First District. They were all presented to the county government for interrogation in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou, Patrol Team Intercepts Flesh Ransom</h3>
<p>Yang Jiang's barge was sailing from Zhongyou to Jiangjiaba the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, when it reached the reeds at the river mouth, it suddenly encountered six bandits who fired their guns as a warning and shouted for the barge to stop. They swarmed onto the boat and searched, stealing a handbag containing 60 yuan in silver and clothing. They also kidnapped Yang Jiang's granddaughter-in-law, Ms. Liu, and her eight-month-old great-grandson. At that time, Hu Xiaojin, the patrol officer of the Second Detachment of the Gaobao Patrol Team, was leading a team patrolling the lake. Suddenly hearing the sound of gunfire, they immediately pursued them, knocking down one of the kidnapped Ms. Liu, a flesh ransom. The bandits had already disappeared. As it was getting late, it was not convenient to pursue them further. However, Yang Jiang's great-grandson was still in danger. Team Leader Wang of the Gaobao Patrol Team has ordered detectives to investigate in all directions.</p>
<h3>Jiashan, Widow Commits Suicide to Preserve Chastity and Follow Husband</h3>
<p>In the area of Xu Jia Bang north of Dingjiazhai, the farmer Xu Zhongyou had two sons, Erguan and Fusheng. Erguan married a woman the year before last, but died of illness. Fusheng married a Ms. Li. Ms. Li had some knowledge of writing and was named Yueying. After marriage, their relationship became very close. Unexpectedly, Fusheng's tuberculosis became severe and he soon passed away. Ms. Li was extremely saddened and vowed to preserve her chastity. The day before yesterday, her brother-in-law Erguan actually wanted to marry his brother's widow and had obtained the consent of his parents. When Ms. Li heard about it, she secretly hanged herself last night to follow her husband in death. It was truly tragic.</p>
<h3>The Bride is Actually the Goddess of Fire</h3>
<p>Xu Kefu, a resident of Hujia Bang in Yangmiao Town, married his son Zhuoying the day before yesterday. Xu was a wealthy man, and the bride, Zhou Meizhen, had received an education. Therefore, guests gathered and the wedding was extremely extravagant. The bride's trousseau was also quite rich. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the same day, just as the newlyweds were holding their wedding ceremony, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen. For a moment, the flames soared and could not be approached. Relatives and friends fled for their lives, in a state of extreme embarrassment, with loud cries and shouts, and the order was chaotic. Fortunately, someone managed to escort the bride back to her parents' home. All the houses, buildings, and utensils were reduced to ashes. In the chaos, the groom broke a leg and was taken to Jiashan Hospital for treatment that night.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou, Hanghui Highway Automobile Robbed</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Hanghui Highway last year, travelers and merchants from Zhejiang and Anhui provinces have found it convenient. At 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month, a Huizhou man, Cheng, and two tea merchants, Fang and others, took a small charter car, Anhui character 1032, from She County to Hangzhou. At 3:15 PM, when they drove through the area where Moshikeng in Lin'an County in Zhejiang Province meets Zhoushan Station, two robbers suddenly appeared, each holding a handgun, and shouted for them to stop. Cheng was robbed of 65 yuan in paper money. Fang and others were robbed of a gold ring worth one钱 (approximately 3.7 grams) each and 6 yuan in silver. They then left. Fortunately, more than 2,000 yuan in paper money was hidden in a handbag and was not searched and robbed. The incident was reported to the Lin'an County government by telephone, requesting the arrest of the robbers.</p>
<h3>Hefei, Adultery Murder Case Occurs in Liu Mu Alley</h3>
<p>Li Decai, a native of Liu'an, who lived in Liu Mu Alley in the north gate, was acquainted with a woman from Changzhou, Ms. Li, and lived in Hefei. Currently, Li Decai is addicted to opium and is in dire straits. Ms. Li then had an affair with Li Jingnan, a clerk at the Hu Hongsheng Paper Shop on Dongmen Street. On the night of the 9th, when Li Jingnan was having a secret rendezvous with Ms. Li, Li Decai found out. Burning with anger, he charged into the bedroom with a kitchen knife and hacked at the adulterous couple. Li Jingnan's head, neck, and arms were cut six or seven times, and Ms. Li's abdomen, legs, and lower body were cut four or five times. They both cried for help, alarming the landlord, Wu Qifa, who opened the door to look. Li Decai then abandoned the knife and fled. Li Jingnan and Ms. Li were both lying in a pool of blood, on the verge of death. On the morning of the 10th, the Wu family reported the case to the military police and the court, causing a sensation throughout the city. The crowd of onlookers was huge. A serious manhunt is underway.</p>
<h3>Chu Family Robbed of Large Amount of Gold Jewelry</h3>
<p>The home of Chu Wuluan, a wealthy man in the upper part of Youfang Lane, had purchased a large amount of gold jewelry and gold bars during the life of his father, Chu Huaiqing, and stored it under the floor in his mother, Zhang's room. Even the family members did not know about it. Unexpectedly, last night, seven or eight robbers climbed over the back wall and hid in the kitchen. When Chu's daughter-in-law, who was in confinement, ordered the maid to prepare supper, she suddenly saw the robbers with their faces covered and was greatly frightened and wanted to run away. The robbers stopped the woman and then pushed into Chu's mother's bedroom. Chu's mother knew they were being robbed and hurriedly took out 400 yuan to give to them. They ignored it and went straight to the head of the bed, moved the jar of salted eggs, pried open the floor, and took out two large boxes containing more than 120 taels of pure gold and more than 20 gold bars. Together with the 400 yuan given by Chu's mother, they were all robbed. Afterwards, the military police were reported to arrest the robbers, but they had disappeared without a trace. However, since the Chu family had buried the gold more than ten years ago, only two groups of people knew about it, so there was no suspicion. Also, since the neighbors were very suspicious, it was reported today and more than twenty people were arrested for strict questioning.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Zhang Gongquan Discusses His Impressions of Traveling in Sichuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan, the general manager of the Bank of China, had many impressions from this trip to Sichuan. Therefore, he wrote an article on his findings for the reference of all circles to develop Sichuan Province. The record is as follows:</p>
<h3>Trade Deficit Exhausts Finances</h3>
<p>This time, I traveled to Sichuan, first to Chongqing, then to Neijiang, Zigong, and then to Chengdu. From Chengdu to Jiading, Xufu, Luzhou, and back to Chongqing, and then to Beipei, traveling for 45 days. Sichuan naturally has all the common problems of various provinces, such as poor politics, excessive tax burdens, difficult lives for farmers, reduced purchasing power, trade imbalances, and exhausted finances.</p>
<h3>There are Four Special Diseases</h3>
<p>The first is the defense zone system. Before last year, Sichuan was almost divided into four or five countries, with defense zones for the 21st Army, the 24th Army, the 28th Army, and the 29th Army, each seemingly independent. Even taxes and currencies were managed independently. When goods were transferred through a defense zone, they had to be taxed once. Since the end of the Second Liu War, Liu Wenhui has retreated to Xikang, and the defense zone run by Liu Xiang has greatly expanded. His power has exceeded that of other armies. The power of other armies, such as Yang, Deng, and Tian, is far less than before, but the defense zone system still exists. The second is the heavy collection of land taxes. Due to financial difficulties, each defense zone can collect land taxes more than ten times a year, averaging at least seven times, and the people have to work hard to bear the burden. Their suffering can be imagined. The third is miscellaneous taxes. Various provinces have abolished Likin, but Sichuan Province taxes various goods passing through, almost every item has a tax, and the establishment of checkpoints for collection is no different from Likin in disguise. The fourth is the non-unification of currency. The provinces now use silver dollars, but Sichuan has a special Sichuan silver dollar, which is of a lower standard than the silver dollar, about 100 yuan lower per 1,000 yuan. There are also other areas that use small silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Abundant Natural Resources and New Thoughts</h3>
<p>The population of Sichuan is almost the highest among the provinces, said to be 70 million, more than the entire country of Japan, and its reproductive capacity is still increasing daily. Farmers are exceptionally hardworking. The fields we have traveled through have almost no wasteland. The fields are neat and tidy. It is known at a glance that they are a hard-working people. Secondly, natural resources are abundant, and the land is fertile. The entire province produces almost everything except cotton. It can be said that where there are people, there is land, and where there is land, there is wealth. Sichuan is enough to be called it. It is a pity that the wealth is used to raise soldiers and fight civil wars, which is a disservice to the people who work hard all year round and the natural treasures. At the same time, one thing to note is that the people of Sichuan have new ideas and are good at chasing trends. Now Chongqing has a public treasury and a securities exchange. Generally, things from Shanghai are easily imported. This is also a great convenience for the future reform of Sichuan. There is no shortage of ambitious people in society, such as Mr. Lu Zuofu, who is painstakingly engaged in social work and striving for spiritual construction, all of which are noteworthy and gratifying.</p>
<h3>The Hope for Awareness from All Armies in the Future</h3>
<p>Currently, Liu Xiang, the Supervisor-General, is diligently engaged in bandit suppression. He has expressed that after the bandit suppression is completed, he will immediately engage in post-disaster recovery, find ways to reduce the army, reorganize internally, and then engage in construction. His enthusiasm for protecting Sichuan and his determination to reorganize Sichuan, as well as his personal integrity, are truly admirable. However, the most important thing is still the awareness of each army, jointly abolishing the defense zone system, unifying politics and finance, reducing the burden on the people, and having a reasonable tax system, so that the people can have a little respite, indirectly prevent the people from becoming communists, and directly promote the increase of production. Only then can we talk about post-disaster recovery and hope for the success of the red suppression. Otherwise, I am afraid that the cart will be put before the horse. It is especially hoped that the military and political authorities who have never left Sichuan in the past will travel to other provinces more, so that the provinces and Nanjing and Shanghai can communicate more with Sichuan, then the progress and construction of Sichuan will be more rapid.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants Should Have Vision for Sichuan</h3>
<p>Given the large population and abundant resources of Sichuan, and its area almost equal to that of Germany, Sichuan Province should be regarded as a large market for Shanghai's industries. Needless to say, in terms of consumption, even for cotton yarn alone, if Sichuan Province can be stable and the people's purchasing power slightly increased, then the cotton yarn produced by Shanghai's Chinese yarn factories can easily be absorbed by Sichuan Province alone. However, if we want to make Sichuan a sales market for Shanghai's manufactured goods, we must find ways to increase the purchasing power of the people of Sichuan. To increase purchasing power, we must increase the productivity of the people of Sichuan. To increase production, we must also help Sichuan sell its products, so that Sichuan's exports and imports can offset each other. Therefore, on the one hand, there should be more technical personnel going to Sichuan to help plan various constructions, and on the other hand, when the political situation is slightly stable and the currency system is slightly reorganized, funds should be gradually input to increase its production funds. This is the vision that Shanghai's industrial circles should have. In short, people from other provinces should approach the people of Sichuan with deep sympathy to fulfill their responsibility of guidance.</p>
<h3>Developing Greater Shanghai: The Municipal Government Issues Public Bonds Totaling 3.5 Million Yuan Approved by the Central Political Conference</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, this city is a major port in East Asia, with ships gathering and talents flourishing. It is not only the economic and cultural center of the country, but also related to international observation. The planning and improvement of municipal administration should not be delayed. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of this city, is actively seeking the development of new urban areas in order to adapt to future needs and construction convenience. Since the completion and relocation of the new building of the municipal government in the city center, the citizens' perceptions have been refreshed. However, the construction of undertakings is in full swing, and local resources are limited. According to the city's original income, it is feared that it will not be enough to cover the application of the original undertaking. Moreover, great construction is not possible. Therefore, Mayor Wu requested the Central Government to approve the issuance of 3.5 million yuan of 7% public bonds in this city in the 23rd year of the Republic, using the donations and taxes of this city as collateral. It has been resolved and approved by the Central Political Conference, and it can be issued after being reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan. It is reported that the use of the public bonds has been stipulated as follows:</p>
<h3>Building a Sports Field</h3>
<p>This city is the education center of the country. The promotion of sports is especially valued by the central government. Moreover, the next National Games has been scheduled to be held in this city next year, and the Far East Games will also be held in Shanghai. Therefore, this city urgently needs to build a large public sports field to meet the needs of the environment.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Museum</h3>
<p>Modern science is prosperous, and the organization of national heritage is closely related to the promotion of new culture. The importance of this city's position, for the research institution of museums, is still lacking. Since the establishment of a public museum, to promote impressions, and the ancient relics of the Forbidden City, a part of the belonging, are now rented for storage. If the hospital is built, it can also be deposited and kept in moderation, so as to avoid the need to find another storage money, resulting in more difficulties.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Library</h3>
<p>This city is also a gathering place of talents. The Oriental Library, established by the Commercial Press, did exist before, but it was destroyed by Japanese artillery fire during the "January 28th" Incident and has not been restored. At present, the public and private libraries are all poorly equipped. At the moment of advocating academic national salvation, this city urgently needs to build a larger public library to seek the revival of culture.</p>
<h3>Building a Municipal Hospital</h3>
<p>This city has the most dense population among major cities, and should have perfect facilities for public health. Therefore, the municipal government is now planning to allocate a part of the public bonds to build a perfect municipal hospital, so that all citizens can enjoy the convenience and safety of medicine.</p>
<h3>Organizing Slaughterhouses</h3>
<p>This city is the largest commercial port in Asia. Even the slaughter of animals has long been improved in the concession, and the concession authorities have set up slaughterhouses for application. However, there are no such facilities in the Chinese boundary, which is closely related to the public health of the citizens. Although the municipal government has discussed the organization, it has not been realized due to limited financial resources. Therefore, this matter will be organized after the issuance of public bonds this time.</p>
<h3>Repairing Various Roads</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the disaster area in Zhabei has been vast. Although public bonds for post-war reconstruction have been raised to provide relief, only a part of the work can be completed. The most urgent things to be reorganized and expanded at present are (A) the construction and repair of various roads and bridges in the Balian Special Zone, (B) the construction of ditches, (C) the completion of Zhongshan Road, and (D) the construction and improvement of water and electricity roads. These are all of great significance to the development of the city center. Therefore, work can be started as soon as the public bonds are sold.</p>

<p>Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, went to Southeast Asia for inspection with He Zhuoxian, the Director of the Trademark Bureau. On the morning of the 11th, Chen returned to Shanghai by ship, rested for a while, and left from the North Station by the Beijing-Shanghai train at 4:05 pm yesterday to go to Beijing to report to the central government on the inspection.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Arima Reported to Japan That Kuramoto Was Found. The Japanese Embassy Received a Notice from Beijing at 4 PM Yesterday.</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the disappearance of Kuramoto Hideaki, the Japanese Deputy Consul in Beijing, on the night of the 8th, has attracted the attention of Chinese and foreign people. After Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs, learned of the news, he immediately ordered the military and police of the capital to mobilize and search. The Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai and Hankou also received orders to sail to the waters of Xiaguan one after another, which aroused the attention of Chinese and foreign people. It is now learned that Deputy Consul Kuramoto was found by our side at Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum in the capital at about 1:00 pm yesterday and sent to the Capital Police Department. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately notified Suma, the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, in writing. Suma reported to Ambassador Arima by long-distance telephone between Beijing and Shanghai at about 4:00 pm. The news obtained in this port is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Our Side Worked Hard to Search</h3>
<p>After Deputy Consul Kuramoto disappeared in Beijing on the night of the 8th, the Capital Police Department and the Garrison Headquarters immediately received orders to search in all directions, day and night. Shimizu, the police chief of the Japanese Embassy, also sent personnel to assist in the search, but there were no results for many days. The Japanese warships stationed on the Shanghai River and the Japanese warships stationed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River were also ordered to sail to Beijing one after another and stationed in the waters of Xiaguan. At the same time, the Japanese expatriates in the capital believed that Kuramoto's disappearance in the capital was obviously due to our country's lack of protection, and they were quite indignant. As a result, the Kuramoto disappearance incident has become increasingly serious in recent days.</p>
<h3>Found Near Ming Mausoleum</h3>
<p>It was not until about 1:00 pm yesterday that Deputy Consul Kuramoto was safely found at Ming Mausoleum. According to the Japanese news in this port, at about 1:00 pm yesterday, the Ming Mausoleum guard accidentally found a Japanese person nearby. At that time, he did not know that he was Deputy Consul Kuramoto, who had been searched for for several days but could not be found. He reported to the Capital Police Department. After receiving the report, the Police Department immediately sent two armed policemen and one plainclothes detective to go to the place of discovery to confirm the truth and hired a car to send him to the Police Department. After learning of the news, the Japanese side also sent personnel to Ming Mausoleum to find and identify him. At that time, Deputy Consul Kuramoto had already been sent to the Police Department.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Japanese Consulate News</h3>
<p>According to Iwai Eiichi, the representative of the Information Office of the Japanese Consulate General in this port, told the Central News Agency reporter that the Shanghai Consulate General had received a report that Deputy Consul Kuramoto was found in Beijing. The details of the discovery are unknown. Iwai also said that Suma, the Consul General of Japan in Nanjing, reported to Ambassador Arima by long-distance telephone between Beijing and Shanghai after 4:00 pm, saying, "The Consulate General of Japan in Nanjing has just received a formal notification from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that Deputy Consul Kuramoto was found this afternoon (that is, yesterday)." The wording is very simple, so detailed information cannot be disclosed, and so on.</p>
<h3>Arima Reported to Japan by Telegram</h3>
<p>After receiving the report, Ambassador Arima immediately telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo to report. It is also learned that the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai had not received a detailed report on the discovery of Kuramoto until 5:00 pm, so the office hours were extended yesterday to wait for the telegram.</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Has Returned to Shanghai. No Negotiations Have Been Conducted Between the Two Sides on All Outstanding Diplomatic Cases Between China and Russia.</h3>
<p>Soviet Russian Ambassador to China Bogomolov went to Ping to inspect the situation of overseas Chinese, then went to Tianjin to meet with Dr. Yan Huiqing, the Chinese Ambassador to Russia, and hosted the Tianjin press to show contact. Then he went south to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the new building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last Friday. It is now learned that Bogomolov returned to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and stayed at the Soviet Russian Consulate on the Bund. Regarding all outstanding diplomatic cases between China and Russia, according to the Xinhua News Agency reporter's investigation from the diplomatic circles, no negotiations have been conducted between the two sides so far. As for the rumors that the China-Russia Non-Aggression Treaty and the China-Russia Commercial Treaty have been negotiated and finalized by the Chinese and Russian diplomatic authorities, it is feared that this is only a speculation.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Invests in the Construction of National Grain Warehouses. The Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of Eight Provinces Will Be Run by the Central Government. Grain Warehouses Will Be Built First in Eight Places Including Shanghai and Kaifeng.</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times News Agency, the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, which was produced by the Eight Provinces Grain Conference, was originally vigorously promoted by Chairman Jiang. The share capital was 2 million yuan, of which 1 million yuan was allocated separately by the provinces, and the central government was responsible for borrowing 1 million yuan. Unfortunately, the provinces should pay the salary, which is of no help. Therefore, Gu Shengxin, the director of the preparation of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, and Wu Huanru, the deputy director, found it difficult to advance or retreat. They went to Gan the other day to ask for instructions and clarified all the difficulties. However, Jiang still insisted on active progress. If the provinces no longer pay the money, they decided to return all the money that has been paid as it is, and the central government will completely fund the operation. At that time, Kong Xiangxi happened to be in Gan, and Jiang personally instructed and ordered Cai Kong to plan and the Central Bank to fund the progress.</p>
<h3>Gu Xinyi Visited Cai Kong for Days</h3>
<p>This time, Kong Xiangxi, the president of the Central Bank, came to Shanghai after the financial meeting. Since the Grain Transportation Bureau had been instructed by Jiang, it must be implemented according to the order. Gu Xinyi was repeatedly invited to discuss the progress plan, and Gu reported all the preparations of the Grain Transportation Bureau and the amount of money paid by the provinces and cities. Kong believed that the organization of the Grain Transportation Bureau was originally handled by merchants with their own funds. Now that the merchant shares cannot be paid in full, if the central government takes charge, the organization must be changed, and it must be discussed with Song Ziwen of the National Economic Commission. In the future, this agency may have to be subordinate to the National Economic Commission and merged into the Grain Control Association that is being organized and established. Therefore, he promised to study all the rules and regulations within a few days and then discuss them with Song before deciding on a concrete plan.</p>
<h3>Invest in the Construction of National Warehouses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times News Agency reporter learned from the Central Bank yesterday that Kong is now willing to actively plan the progress of the Grain Transportation Bureau. However, the most important thing is the construction of grain warehouses, because the most important function of the Transportation and Sales Bureau is to regulate grain. In other words, the state's power is used to control the market price of grain. When farmers have surplus grain, the Transportation and Sales Bureau will purchase it in large quantities and store it for a long time. When farmers lack grain, they will take it out of the warehouse and supply it in large quantities. This is the general hub for regulating supply and demand. Without large grain warehouses in various places, it will not be enough to cope with it. Now Kong has decided to build a large-scale new-style warehouse in each of the eight places including Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Changsha, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. At least 3 million yuan of grain can be stored to prepare for emergencies. The required funds are about 500,000 yuan for each place, totaling 4 million yuan, which will be invested and constructed by the Central Bank. The Shanghai Municipal Government originally planned to carry out the construction of these warehouses and had detailed budgets and construction plans for Class A, B, C, and D. Later, the progress was suspended due to the difficulty of raising funds. Now President Kong has instructed the municipal government authorities to submit this construction plan for reference.</p>

<h3>Suspension of Attendance</h3>
<p>According to the articles of association of the Chamber of Commerce, those who owe membership fees for less than two years will be suspended from enjoying their rights, and those who owe membership fees for more than two years will be expelled. It is now found that the following 15 trade association members owe membership fees for more than two years: embroidery industry, boiled water shop, spring chair industry, cotton ginning industry, Chinese and Western furniture shop industry, tourism industry, old flower industry, Chinese medicine industry, machine mold industry, silk dyeing industry, noodle industry, auction industry, pollen industry, letterpress printing industry, and fresh meat industry. In addition, Zhenhua Paint Factory and Yili Soda Factory, two store members, were decided by the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday. If they do not pay the outstanding fees before the General Assembly on the 17th of this month, they should immediately be suspended from enjoying their rights and stop issuing attendance certificates to the General Assembly representatives. Whether to expel them will still be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<h3>Payment of Debt Interest</h3>
<p>The association also decided to pay half of the second installment of the interest on the old Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Public Bonds and the full amount of principal and interest on the seventh installment of the Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce Construction Public Bonds from July 1.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zaizhen Telegraphed to Report That He Long's Bandits Invaded Guizhou</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Jiang Bixu, the commander of the Qian Division stationed in northern Guizhou, sent a telegram to Deng Wujie (Deng is from Guizhou), the representative of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Supervisor in Shanghai, describing the situation of He Long's bandit forces invading Guizhou. The original telegram is as follows: Mr. Deng Wujie, I trust that you have received my previous telegram. I have received your telegram forwarded by Gong, and I understand the situation. The Communist bandits entered our defense of Paishui in Houping County, which belongs to Pengshui in Sichuan, and were hit head-on by our Yang Brigade. The bandits avoided the real and attacked the empty, climbed mountains and ridges, and fled to Baicun area in Wuchuan County. Yesterday, they came into contact with our troops stationed in Wu. The situation has been telegraphed to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of Nanchang, for investigation. The Communist bandits call themselves the Third Revolutionary Red Army of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guizhou. He Long is the commander of the bandit army, Guan Hongying is the political commissar of the bandit army, and Xia Xi is the chairman of the bandit army. They have about six or seven thousand guns and more than ten thousand people, with not many bullets. They attempt to turn northern Guizhou red and then attempt Qinan and link up with the bandit army of the Fourth Front Army in northern Sichuan. If they are encircled and suppressed before they go too deep, it will be very easy. The details will be telegraphed separately. Jiang Zaizhen, printed.</p>
<h3>China Aviation Corporation Discussed: The Shanghai-Ping Route Detours to Weihai. Weihai Has a Large Existing Airfield. Takeoffs and Landings Are Handled by the Management Office on Behalf of the Company.</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Corporation previously received a letter from Xu Dongfan, the Weihaiwei Management Commissioner, stating that Weihaiwei is an important port in North China. In addition to the highway between Yantai and Weihai for automobiles, the land transportation is quite far from the Jiaoji and Jinpu railways, so passengers and mail traveling by land are quite inconvenient. More than three years have passed since the port was recovered. At present, all local administrative affairs have been actively carried out, and it will surely become an important commercial port in North China and the only military port in Beiyang. Land transportation must rely on aviation. The Changfeng area of Weihaiwei has a huge airfield, and the necessary equipment for aircraft takeoffs and landings has been completed. If the airline adds Weihai to the route and makes it a takeoff and landing station, passengers and mail traveling to and from Weihai will be greatly facilitated, and the company will be spared the work and expenses of opening a field and other equipment, which can also achieve twice the result with half the effort. After receiving the letter, the airline attached great importance to it and immediately replied, stating that if the Shanghai-Ping route detours to Weihai, it will have to be increased from eight hours to ten hours. It is currently under discussion. Later, Commissioner Xu telegraphed again, stating that flying and landing during the day would take 11 hours. During the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, it should be within a possible range and should not cause difficulties. However, the matter concerns aviation time, and the company should directly measure and allocate the time and re-specify it, or it may be shortened. However, after setting up a station, the Weihai Management Office can assign personnel to handle the care of aircraft takeoffs and landings, as well as the reception of passengers and the sale and collection of tickets, purely as an obligation, so that the company can be exempted from the station expenses. The company is now conducting in-depth research on this issue.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau: Reorganizing the Machine Style and Expanding the Lines. The Number of Lines to the Concession Has Increased to 70 Pairs.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications requested the Ministry of Communications to reorganize the user small exchange and expand the wiring business in order to maintain the telephone service. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Machine Style</h3>
<p>The telephone bureau believes that the small exchanges of users in various districts have different styles, which makes it difficult to maintain. Therefore, it intends to determine the reorganization method and submit it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. According to the number of relay lines and extensions required by users, it is divided into three types: intercom type, button type, and floor-standing type. Those who use one to sixteen extensions will be equipped with intercom type exchanges. Ten to sixteen extensions can be equipped with button type exchanges. Those who use sixteen to fifty extensions will use floor-standing type exchanges. It has already been ordered from various electrical material firms to purchase products manufactured in China. Once they are delivered, they will be reorganized one after another.</p>
<h3>Expanding the Number of Lines</h3>
<p>There were 50 pairs of existing lines to connect to the concession. Recently, the number of users requesting installation has increased, and the telephone business has also developed accordingly. In addition, after the bureau canceled the five-point call fee, the original number of pairs of lines was insufficient for application. Therefore, the telephone bureau plans to expand the number of Chinese-concession call lines from 50 pairs to 70 pairs in the near future, and then expand again in the future according to business needs. The zero-number switchboard connecting to the concession will also be expanded in response to user needs. In addition, after the telephones in Longhua, Pudong, and other places were reformed, the telephone bureau specially compiled a new directory for the 23rd year. The bureau sent a letter to each user with a coupon to receive it, which can be started in about 20 days.</p>

<h3>Subsidizing Chinese Silk Exports: Chinese and Foreign Merchant Ships Reduce Freight Rates. Domestic Silk Cocoons Reduce by Half Price. Silk Shipped to the United States Is Charged Two Yuan per Piece.</h3>
<p>In order to rescue Chinese silk exports, in addition to the ten items on reforming the silk and silkworm method, which were announced to Shanghai by the Ministry of Industry long ago, there are reductions in the transportation costs of silk cocoons and various donations and taxes. The Executive Yuan has transferred the order to the transportation and finance ministries, and ordered the relevant agencies under their jurisdiction to handle the matter. The Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this port have also received the order and have already drawn up plans to reduce water feet to promote the export of Chinese silk. The situation heard is described as follows:</p>
<h3>Domestic Half-Price Charge</h3>
<p>After receiving the instructions from the Ministry of Communications, the shipping companies in this port first negotiated the reduction of freight rates for silk cocoons, mulberry seedlings, and other items to rescue silk and silkworms. The state-owned China Merchants Bureau in this port first decided that where the bureau's ships pass, such as when silk cocoons and mulberry seedlings are reported for loading, special reduced rates will be allowed. It was decided that the freight rates set for each route will be charged at half price to show preferential treatment. The bureau has submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications and transferred it to the Ministry of Industry. As for other private shipping companies and railway lines, they are also planning to reduce and charge the transportation rates of silk cocoons and other items.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Reduce Prices for Transportation and Loading</h3>
<p>The most common export goods from Shanghai to the United States via Pacific mail ships between China and the United States are Chinese silk. In the past, shipping companies competed fiercely to load Huzhou silk. From Shanghai to various ports in the United States, such as San Francisco, Seattle, or Vancouver in Canada, each piece of Huzhou silk, weighing 112 pounds, used to cost 12 US dollars. Later, due to mutual competition for loading, the price fell to 6.75 US dollars. Recently, due to the declining export volume, shipping companies continued to call for price cuts, reducing each piece to 5 US dollars, then falling to 4 US dollars, and finally to 3 yuan. It can be said that there is no more cheapest price. Recently, the Chinese government specially requested foreign merchant shippers to reduce the fees to help export Chinese silk, so the Shanghai Pacific Water Foot Association specially convened representatives of various shipping companies to discuss the matter. As a result, starting from the 11th of this month, the price of Chinese silk shipped from Shanghai to the United States will be reduced by another one yuan per piece, and only two US dollars will be charged. Yesterday, all mail ships were notified to implement it uniformly. According to people in the shipping company, the current water feet are only enough to pay the wages for loading, unloading, and storage. The shipping company has no freight feet to get.</p>
<h3>Plan to Dredge the Wusong River</h3>
<p>Funding: 2.4 Million</p>
<p>Project: Completed within Six Years</p>
<p>Regarding the dredging of the Wusong River, the Ministry of Interior convened representatives from four agencies, including the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Ministry of Communications Waterway Consolidation Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, to hold a meeting in Beijing a few days ago to discuss the dredging plan and funding in detail, and decided to continue to hold a meeting in Beijing yesterday to discuss. As for the dredging funding, it has been predetermined to be 2.4 million yuan, which will be borrowed from the National Economic Commission. Moreover, due to the large area of the river, the dredging work will divide the mouth into four sections, and the entire project is expected to be completed within six years. As for the detailed plan, it is still under discussion.</p>

<h3>Families of Jilin Volunteer Army; Central Government Approves Funds for Repatriation to Xinjiang; Four-Article Plan Drafted for Sending Them Back; To Be Handled by Li Du</h3>
<p>The families of various units of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, after being forced to retreat into Russia, entered the mainland last spring, residing in Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places. It has now been over a year. The livelihoods of these families have been maintained by charitable organizations and various sources of assistance. However, some have been repatriated to their hometowns, while many remain. Among these families, those belonging to Generals Li Du and Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin are the most numerous. Sacrificing for the country and drifting from place to place is not a long-term solution. General Li Du recently submitted a request to the central government for funds to repatriate them to their hometowns, allowing them to seek their own livelihoods. It is reported that the central government has approved the request and has drafted four articles for sending the families of Jilin soldiers to Xinjiang, to be handled by General Li Du. The Far East News Agency reporter has gathered the following information: (1) Repatriation Preparations: (A) Regarding the families of current Jilin military officers residing in Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin, Commander Li Du should first conduct a separate investigation, inquire whether they are willing to go to Xinjiang, and record the current position and location of their family heads. A clear list should then be submitted. (B) After the investigation is completed, Commander Li Du should appoint escorts and propose a schedule for gathering the families in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping. The departure time should be determined in consultation with the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the families should be notified to board the train on time. (C) All families willing to go to Xinjiang should be notified to prepare themselves in advance for departure. (2) Repatriation Route: It has been decided that the families will enter Xinjiang via Suining. The transportation will be divided into three stages as follows: (A) From Shanghai via Tianjin and Beiping to Baotou is the first stage. The Railway Department should be instructed to prepare trains for transportation. (B) From Baotou to Ningxia is the second stage. The Suiyuan Provincial Government will provide transportation by automobile. (C) From Ningxia to Dihua is the third stage. The Ningxia Provincial Government will continue the transportation by automobile. (3) Repatriation Funds: A detailed budget should be prepared for the funds. The following temporary advance payment methods are proposed: (A) Subsistence Allowance: Each family member will receive a subsistence allowance of four yuan per day from the date of boarding. The allowance for the first stage will be budgeted by Commander Li Du, issued to the escorts, and accounted for upon completion. The Suiyuan and Ningxia Provincial Governments will verify the number of family members and estimate the transportation time for the second and third stages to calculate and advance the payment. (B) Automobile Expenses: The automobile expenses for the second and third stages will be paid by the Suiyuan and Ningxia Provincial Governments, and a report will be submitted afterward along with the subsistence allowance for verification and reimbursement. (C) The aforementioned expenses will be issued by the Ministry of Finance, and a detailed budget will be prepared for special disbursement. (4) Others: (A) When the families begin their journey, the Xinjiang Provincial Government should be notified by telegram so that each family head can prepare for resettlement. (B) During the journey from Baotou via Ningxia to Dihua, the Ministry of Military Affairs should instruct the garrisons along the way to provide adequate protection from the start of the repatriation.</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Labor Dispute; Municipal Government to Convene Mediation Today; Central Investigator Returned to Nanjing Last Night to Report</h3>

<h3>Central Commissioner Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, in order to understand the truth of the Anglo-American labor dispute and facilitate mediation, specially dispatched Wang Diwen, the director of the Workers' Section, to Shanghai for investigation.

All work has been completed, and he took a train back to Nanjing last night.</p>
<h3>Jardine Employees Refuse to Transport</h3>
<p>The stevedores and cargo handling employees of Jardine Matheson's Jianghai Shipping, in order to support the Anglo-American workers, have decided to refuse to transport Anglo-American products from today. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Strike Committee stating: "To the Esteemed Committee, We have heard that the Anglo-American Puxi old factory was suddenly shut down, and the issue remains unresolved to this day. Upon hearing this, the members of our union have been extremely indignant. Such unreasonable actions violate our national laws and regulations. Such is the true face of imperialism. If we do not resist with all our might, what future can your committee envision? Our maritime unions are also deeply affected. Under these circumstances, our union expresses deep sympathy for your committee's solidarity, resistance, and sacrificial struggle. After discussion, if the Anglo-American Tobacco Company does not realize its error within this week and there is still no satisfactory resolution, our union, mindful of our shared interests, is prepared to act as your rearguard with all our strength. In addition to notifying the Jardine Matheson Shipping Company to suspend the acceptance of Anglo-American cigarettes, we will also notify all cargo handling employees of our affiliates to unanimously refuse loading, mindful of our shared interests. After several meetings among the workers of various ships, the dispute with your committee has not been resolved. We will unanimously refrain from smoking Anglo-American cigarettes to urge the Anglo-American tobacco factory to realize its error. We will also jointly issue a declaration with the cargo handling clubs of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Taikoo Dockyard, and Nissin Kisen Kaisha to provide assistance. Therefore, our union has specially dispatched executive member Chen Yuanlong to deliver this letter to express our condolences. We hope that your committee will strive forward without laxity or flattery. As it concerns the future of the labor movement, you must fight to the end until you achieve victory. This is our sincere hope." Jardine Matheson Cargo Handling Club.</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Department; Requests Thorough Investigation of the Cai Qiyi Private Torture Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers’ Association of the International Settlement sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department stating: "Regarding the case of Cai Qinshi, the wife of Cai Yangqi, an accountant at the Long Shun Public Goods Store at No. 58 South Side of the Old North Gate Bridge, who accused Lang Zuyin, a detective of the Old North Gate Police Station, of using cruel private torture that resulted in permanent disability, our association sent a letter on May 15th requesting a thorough investigation without any concealment. We subsequently received your reply dated May 19th, which stated that a thorough investigation could only be conducted if there were credible rumors published in newspapers. If Cai Yangqi wishes to file a complaint regarding the treatment by any personnel of the department, the department is willing to receive evidence from him personally. The department would only be able to investigate if he is able to come to the office of the Director-General at his convenience, with or without friends or lawyers. This matter was discussed at the Second Executive Committee Meeting of our association, which concluded that since Cai Qinshi had already filed a lawsuit in the judicial aspect, your department should order the detectives involved in this case to be summoned for questioning and await the court's judgment. In the administrative aspect, your department has a responsibility to conduct its own thorough investigation to determine whether there were any tools or actions within or outside the police station that could cause permanent disability. You should not offer empty words or engage in concealment or abetment. We ask, since your department does not and cannot conduct a legally effective interrogation after instructing Cai Yangqi to file a complaint, and since detectives are employed and directed by your department, a failure to investigate the truth after an accusation is made will only lead to the perception of protection and bias. Such a method is extremely unwise. Therefore, we are writing to your department again, urging you to investigate as requested in our previous letter, conduct a thorough and strict investigation on your own, and strictly order or detain the detectives involved in this case for interrogation according to the law, without any protection. This is our earnest hope."</p>
<h3>Wang Zhixiang, Director of the Shangbao Saltpeter Bureau, Arrested; His Family Is Trying to Rescue Him</h3>
<p>China East News reports that on the 8th of this month, the central authorities received a confidential report stating that Wang Zhixiang, Director of the Shangbao Saltpeter Bureau, was suspected of being a communist. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was immediately ordered to dispatch inspectors from the Inspection Department of the bureau, along with secret service detectives, to the bureau at around 8:00 AM that morning. Together with police detectives from the Second Sub-station of the Fifth District, they arrested Wang while he was eating inside and escorted him to the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>After Wang's arrest, his family was extremely panicked. His relatives and friends are now working separately to rescue him.

<h3>Qia Da Lumber Company Declares Liquidation Yesterday; Inventory Piling Up, Financial Turnover Impossible; Debts Reach Around 400,000</h3>
<p>Qia Da Lumber Company, located at the intersection of Guangfu Road and Meiyuan Road in Zhabei, Shanghai, was established in 1912 and has been in business for over twenty years. Its internal scale is grand, making it a giant in the lumber industry in Shanghai. Manager Zhang Shenju is capable and talented, with an excellent reputation for integrity. Various banks competed to invest in the company. Recently, due to the accumulation of old inventory and sluggish cash flow, coupled with the misunderstanding of creditors, it was unable to maintain operations and declared bankruptcy yesterday.</p>
<p>Investors Affected: When the company was established in 1912, its capital was only twenty to thirty thousand yuan. Due to effective management, its business grew rapidly. During its peak period, its total annual turnover reached seven to eight hundred thousand yuan, and usually it was around four to five hundred thousand yuan. Therefore, it enjoyed a high reputation in the business community. Large and small banks in Shanghai competed to invest in the company, with some investing one to two hundred thousand yuan and others several thousand yuan. This sudden bankruptcy has greatly affected the banking community. It is said that the total amount of debt reaches around 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Declaration of Liquidation: After the company's bankruptcy, it immediately entrusted lawyer Tang Wushi and accountant Wang Sifang to handle the liquidation. In addition to sending people to seal up the old inventory and notifying creditors and debtors to register within a specified period, a meeting of creditors will be convened to discuss a proper solution.</p>
<h3>Monument to Deceased Police Officers; Unveiling Ceremony Postponed</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Municipal Monument to Deceased Police Officers," which the Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted for approval to the Municipal Government to commemorate deceased police officers of past sessions, has been delayed due to the incomplete construction of the entire project. It is now learned that as of yesterday, the stone monument and the surrounding arrangements have been completed. The monument is located at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Hongxing Road in northern Shanghai. The area around the monument has been landscaped with walkways and planted with flowers and trees. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau had previously scheduled the unveiling ceremony to be held in front of the monument tomorrow (the 15th) morning. However, according to a message from the bureau yesterday, it will be postponed until this Sunday (the 17th). At that time, in addition to Director Wen Hongen personally attending, senior bureau officials and a portion of the police officers will also be present to offer sacrifices. In addition, the bureau has sent letters to various agencies, inviting them to send representatives to participate at that time.</p>
<h3>National Exhibition Invites Visitors from All Walks of Life; Sets Schedule for Receptions</h3>
<p>Since its opening on June 1st, the National Goods Movement Exhibition at the Shanghai Ponglai Market has attracted large crowds of visitors every day, achieving excellent results. In order to broaden its reach, the Association has drafted a plan to invite representatives from industry, commerce, education, and the press to visit in stages, and has set the following dates for the receptions: June 16th for the industrial sector, June 18th for the commercial sector, June 20th for the educational sector, and June 22nd for the press and citizens of the special districts. Yesterday, the Association issued many invitations to leaders from various sectors, such as the General Labor Union, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Student Union, the Journalists Association, and the Joint Association of Citizens from the First and Second Special Districts, inviting them to lead visits, with entertainment to add to the festive atmosphere. The original letter sent to various sectors is recorded below: "To Our Respected Guests, The nation is declining and foreign aggression is imminent. To save the situation, it is imperative to promote national goods. Based on this principle, our Association has led its employees and factories to organize the Shanghai National Goods Movement Exhibition, which opened on the 1st of this month. Exhibits from over two hundred factories are displayed, giving our compatriots the opportunity to learn about and foster a love for national goods. It is estimated that the city's industrial workers account for one-third of the city's population. If they can use national goods for all their daily needs, how significant would it be for the development of national goods? It has been agreed that June 16th will be the reception day for the industrial sector. Therefore, we specially invite your Association to lead workers from across the city to visit the exhibition at that time. We hope for your kind attention and compliance."</p>
<h3>Xinghua Jiangyong Ship Arrives Safely in Yichang; Rumors of Anchorage Upstream of Jiujiang Untrue</h3>
<p>The Xinghua Shipping Company of this port, organized by major maritime merchants, invested over 200,000 yuan to order an upstream river ship from the Yuanda and Fada factories, naming it Jiangyong. Its cabin comfort, hull strength, and tonnage are the best among upstream river ships. It departed from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th of this month and arrived safely in Hankou on the 9th and Yichang on the morning of the 11th. However, yesterday, rumors spread in this port that the ship had suffered mechanical damage and was anchored upstream of Jiujiang. According to General Manager Liu Yuan of the company, the Jiangyong's hull was manufactured by the Yuanda factory, so it is extremely strong, and the machinery was made by the Fada factory, so the engine's horsepower is sufficient. There is absolutely no such situation. This rumor may be due to a misunderstanding. At the time of the statement, he showed a safe arrival telegram from the ship, saying that yesterday's telegram had reported that it had left Yichang and was heading directly to Sichuan. What the outside world is saying is clearly untrue.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Promulgates Navigation Route Marking Regulations</h3>

<h3>China-Europe Sugar Factory Has an Excellent Reputation</h3>
<p>The Mello Peppermint Candy produced by the China-Europe Sugar Factory in Wu Feng Li, Rue Pére Froc, French Concession, Shanghai, has long been sold in various ports. The factory was founded by sugar magnate Mr. Chen Jusheng over ten years ago. He has done extensive research on producing various kinds of candies, so the business is booming. Recently, competitors, envious of the factory's thriving business, attempted to destroy the Mello Peppermint Candy trademark, leading to litigation. The Second Special District Court ruled against them yesterday.</p>
<h3>Recent Report from the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association; Fundraising Conference Progressing Rapidly; First Clinic Established; Children's Summer Camp Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association began fundraising, reports have been frequently published in the newspapers. It has been learned that the association has recently received donations from various sources, including 1,000 yuan from Du Yuesheng (raised by Mr. Shi Liangcai), 500 yuan from Zhang Xueliang, 200 yuan from Kong Xiangxi, and 100 yuan from the Huaan Hequn Life Insurance Company. The total amount has reached over 20,000 yuan. The association's budget plan, which includes popularizing anti-tuberculosis education nationwide and establishing sanatoriums, requires over 200,000 yuan. Although the funds raised are far from the budget, in order to meet the needs of society and promote the health of the people, the first clinic and a summer children's health camp have been established successively. Their dedication to public welfare is truly commendable. It is reported that the first clinic (located within the City South Health Office at the intersection of Xilin Road and Xumen Xie Xu Road) officially opened this month. Doctors and nurses have also been hired, and dozens of citizens come to the clinic for treatment every day. In order to reduce the burden on the people, the association does not charge consultation fees, but medicine fees are charged. Those who are poor are exempt. This is a true blessing for the poor and sick. Furthermore, the summer children's health camp, jointly organized by the association and public organizations in Shanghai, is now ready after several preparations. It is scheduled to be held from July 6th to August 16th at the middle school of the National Tongji University in Wusong. Children aged seven to twelve, regardless of gender, are welcome to join. The sole purpose of the camp is to improve children's physical and mental health during the summer vacation, cultivate good hygiene habits, and pay special attention to nutrition. Experts in education and medicine have been invited, and a resident school doctor, nurse, teachers, teaching assistants, and staff will be responsible for guiding and managing everything. There is a prescribed daily routine. It is expected to have good results. It is reported that the camp is limited to one hundred students. The registration deadline is at the end of this month. Those who wish to join can register at the following locations: (1) Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association, No. 41 Chihbang Road (near Datong Road intersection), Avenue Edouard VII; (2) Chen Pao News; (3) City South Clinic, Xilin Road, Xumen Xie Xu Road. When registering, parents must fill out an application form and pay a registration fee of three yuan.</p>

<h3>Young Shao Weizu Despairs of Life; Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea from the Wanxiang Ship; Leaves Behind Three Poems Filled with Emotion; Captain Reports to the Shipping Bureau for Record</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Shipping Company's Wanxiang ship, which departed from Shanghai to Fujian on the 3rd of this month, suddenly had a young passenger commit suicide by jumping into the sea. He left behind three poems expressing his despair, filled with emotion. The next morning, a tea server discovered the poems and reported them to the ship's captain, Yang Baokang. Mr. Yang immediately reported the incident to the Fujian-Shanghai Shipping Administration authorities, requesting that it be filed for record and investigated. The report is recorded below: "Report Regarding the Discovery of a Missing Passenger"</p>
<h3>Missing Passenger Suspected Suicide</h3>
<p>We respectfully submit this report regarding the discovery of a missing passenger, suspected to be a suicide, requesting your kind review and filing for record. Our ship departed from Shanghai to Fujian on June 3rd. One third-class passenger, approximately 24 or 25 years old, left his bunk at around 12:00 AM that night, presumably to use the toilet. Therefore, no one suspected anything amiss. However, by the next morning, he had not returned to his bunk. The tea server and nearby passengers noticed and reported to the purser, who reported it to the captain. The captain immediately ordered a ship-wide search, but no trace of him was found. His belongings were then carefully inspected, including a leather suitcase, a felt hat, a business card identifying the man as Shao Weizu of Baoshan, Jiangsu, and a portrait of a man with Western hair (a photograph of which the area was measured at 3.5 cm at the widest point and 4.5 cm at the longest point), and</p>
<h3>Three Pessimistic Poems</h3>
<p>The first, "What does it matter whether I stay or go, a man's ambition soars; like a grain of rice, I drift across the vast seas." The second, "The future stretches like a long night; past events are like fleeting waves." The third, "Since I was not born at the right time, why begrudge death? A moment can be seen as a hundred years." Reading them filled us with sadness and remorse. Thus, it was determined that this gentleman was already weary of life and committed suicide by jumping into the sea. Shao Weizu is likely his surname. In addition to reporting the incident to the local maritime public security bureau and notifying the Fujian branch of the shipping company and the Shanghai headquarters upon the ship's arrival in the Min River, we have also kept the recovered belongings in anticipation of family members claiming them. We respectfully submit this report, requesting your kind review and filing for record, and requesting your instructions to comply. Respectfully submitted, Yang Baokang, Captain of the Wanxiang Ship, Sanbei Shipping Company. It is reported that the Shipping Administration Bureau, after receiving the report, has been trying to locate the family members in order to notify them and enable them to claim the belongings.</p>
<h3>Ping Pong Championship Dispute; Mediation Failed Yesterday; Court Orders Formal Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Xiangbin Cup Ping Pong Tournament, organized by the Racecourse Club, attracted many participants. After the battles, the Jiande Ping Pong Team and the Guangdong Ping Pong Team were tied for first place with 17 points each. Subsequently, the organizing committee of the cup competition scheduled the final match to be held on the evening of the 26th of last month at the Meifeng Branch Ping Pong Room. However, the members of the two final teams were participating in the China Ping Pong Association's pre-selection for the China-Japan Far East Ping Pong Tournament. Therefore, in accordance with Article 7, Section 5 of the Xiangbin Cup competition regulations, they sent a letter requesting a postponement. The committee replied one hour before the final match, denying the request. The Guangdong team arrived on time. The Jiande team, due to time constraints, was unable to gather its members and did not attend. The referee, Zhou Weixin, then ruled that Jiande had forfeited, placing them as runners-up. However, the organizing committee of the cup competition changed the referee's ruling and re-ruled that the Jiande team had withdrawn midway, and their scores would not be counted. The Jiande team argued that the withdrawal midway must be voluntary and cannot be forced. Moreover, as the regulations did not authorize the organizing committee to make any rulings, they believed that the ruling was not only illegal but also damaging to their reputation. Therefore, they engaged lawyers Yang Ruinian and Yin Jingyuan to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing the organizing committee members Li Hongde, Lu Xiwu, Shen Zhirui, Shen Ding, Lu Hanjun, Weng Shoufeng, etc., of abusing their authority and requested a preliminary mediation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shi Meiyu of the First Special Court convened a mediation session in Civil Chamber Ten. The Jiande team was represented by Lu Xiu and their agents, lawyers Yin and Yang. Only Lu Xiwu appeared on behalf of the defendants. As the case concerned the future of the sports community, many people attended the court as observers. First, lawyer Yin stated the background, arguing that the withdrawal midway ruled by the defendants must be a voluntary application. The requester's request for postponement was fully compliant with the law and the notification was made, hence the other party had indeed abused their authority. Judge Shi then inquired of Lu Xiwu whether there was a basis for changing the referee's ruling of withdrawal midway. He replied that it was based on Article 7, Section 9 of the regulations. Judge Shi then declared that since the Jiande team and the Guangdong team had made a legitimate request for postponement, and the procedures and regulations had all been completed, it could not be considered non-compliant. As for the meaning of the term "withdrawal midway" in Article 7, Section 9, it applied only if the Jiande team had voluntarily requested to withdraw from the competition. How could that be used as a basis for the ruling? In the opinion of this judge, it would be better to resolve this game-related incident through reconciliation to avoid litigation. The best solution would be for the Jiande and Guangdong teams to compete again and achieve victory through strength, which would be the most appropriate. What do you think? However, Lu Xiwu insisted that this was unacceptable. Judge Shi repeatedly tried to persuade him, but to no avail. Judge Shi then declared that the mediation had failed and ordered the Jiande team to file a formal lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Arrest Gold Smugglers; Customs Actually Assist Japanese Police in Escorting [Them] to Japan from Chinese Territory</h3>
<p>On the 14th of last month, the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru sailed from Japan to Shanghai. A Chinese passenger, Fu Zhilin, and a tea server, Qiu Zhihao, were carrying over 1,760 taels of gold bars, all hidden in two vests. As the passengers were disembarking, the police officer of the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai, upon receiving a telegram from Japanese authorities, stated that Fu and Qiu had violated Japan's gold export ban and should be immediately intercepted and sent to Japan for interrogation. The Japanese Consulate consulted with the Customs authorities and requested assistance in the search. As expected, Fu and Qiu were found among the passengers, and the gold-laden vests were discovered on their persons. Consequently, they were immediately taken to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation along with the witnesses. At that time, Fu and Qiu's families were not in Shanghai, so no one could rescue them, and they were allowed to be escorted back to Japan by the Japanese police. It is now reported that Fu and Qiu's families have heard the news and come to Shanghai, but their inquiries at various government offices have yielded no results. They know that they have been sent to Japan by the Japanese Consulate. However, it has been found that since the Nagasaki Maru has already arrived in Shanghai, it should not arrest people across borders and extradite them privately within Chinese territory. They are now engaging lawyers to petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urgently send a telegram to the Japanese Minister, requesting negotiations in accordance with the treaty.</p>
<h3>Apricot Blossom House Bombing Case: Appeal by the Police Begins; Debate Concludes; Judgment to Be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang, a Sichuan native, is currently twenty-two years old. He used to serve as a volunteer soldier in Zheng Guilin's army. After retiring from the army, he came to Shanghai and joined the Red Blood Assassination Group, which aimed solely to warn treacherous merchants. On May 10th of this year, Zhang learned that the Apricot Blossom House Restaurant on Sima Road was selling Japanese goods such as shark fin, abalone, and dried shrimp. Therefore, at eight o'clock that evening, he threw a bomb as a warning. The bomb did not explode, and Zhang was immediately arrested and handed over to the First Special District Court. After the trial, it was considered that Zhang's actions stemmed from righteous indignation, and he was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. However, Mr. Boling, the Chief Attorney of the Legal Department of the Municipal Council, believed that Zhang Guoxiang had not thoroughly investigated whether Apricot Blossom House was selling Japanese goods. Even if Japanese goods were indeed used, he should not have dealt with it with drastic measures. His blind obedience was obvious. How could it be said to be motivated by righteous indignation? Therefore, he disagreed with the judgment and, together with the lead attorney, Li Zhishan, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting that the original judgment be overturned and a suitable judgment be made. Yesterday afternoon, Zhao Zheng, Jiang Shuzi, and Zhou Han, judges of the Second Branch of the High Court, held a hearing. Attorney Wang Yaotang appeared in court on behalf of the Municipal Council and stated the reasons. The court then interrogated Zhang Guoxiang and announced the conclusion of the debate, setting the judgment to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Begging Unsuccessfully, Old Woman Injures People with Snake; Sentenced to Six Days of Detention</h3>
<p>An old beggar woman, Pan Li, from Anhui Province, fifty years old, went to a certain butcher shop at No. 558 Minguo Road outside the Xiaobeimen of the French Concession at around 8 PM on the 5th of this month to beg unsuccessfully. She took out a poisonous snake she was raising to threaten people, causing the shop's local clerk, Zhu Jinbao, to be bitten on his right hand. The patrol arrested the old woman and brought her to the police station along with the poisonous snake. The snake was first killed, and then the old woman was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday, Judge Qiu Huanying continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. First, Gu Shouxi, the police attorney, presented the case and the investigation process. Then, the plaintiff, Zhu Jinbao, described how the defendant injured people with the snake. After the official questioned the defendant, he sentenced Pan Li to six days of detention. The number of days of pre-trial detention before the judgment is finalized shall be offset against one day of detention, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Women's Organizations: Women's Movement Alliance; Preparatory Meeting to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Women's Political Participation Association, in view of the fact that Chinese women's right to political participation has already been obtained and that there is no complete women's movement organization in the country, convened a general meeting of all members this spring. Ms. Wang Ruizhu, Tang Jiawei, Liu Jichen, Zhu Baoliang, and other gentlemen and ladies proposed to reorganize into the Chinese Women's Movement Alliance. All the members present passed the resolution and publicly elected Ms. Wang Xiaoying, Qian Jianqiu, Chen Lingyi, Chen Yongcheng, Wen Siying, Liu Wang Liming, Mao Manyi, Yang Sulan, Chen Hongbi, Tang Guanyu, Li Guanfang, and Guo Zhenyi, among others, as reorganization committee members.

<h3>Ministry of Industry Approves: Accountants Association Filed for Record</h3>
<p>The Accountants Association of the Republic of China received a dispatch from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, with Commercial Character No. 26525, stating: "Acknowledged upon presentation.

<h3>Huang Jinrong: Establishes Caoxing Temporary Hospital</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Jinrong, a prominent figure in Shanghai, believes that Caohejing is located in the remote west of Shanghai and has never had a hospital, which is inconvenient for the local residents. The poor and sick, in particular, have no one to turn to. In view of this, Mr. Huang plans to build a Caoxing Hospital on the east side of his residence, the Huang Family Garden, with complete new equipment and employing senior doctors to provide some happiness for the local residents. The blueprints of the hospital have already been completed and construction will begin soon. However, with the hot summer approaching and the heat a concern, the spread of epidemics is a matter of urgency. As the area is far from the city center, there may be delays in seeking medical attention for emergencies. Therefore, a Caoxing Temporary Hospital will be temporarily established inside the Caohejing Theater in the east of the garden. Medicines will be given to the poor and sick free of charge, and a special Jinrong refreshing medicine water will be provided, which all residents of Caohejing can receive as a gift. The hospital affairs will be entrusted to the Shanghai Jishen Hospital, with Director Wang Zhenchuan in charge of everything. Well-known doctors will also be employed to be stationed in the hospital for regular consultations. The official opening will be on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>American Soldiers Wander, Car Causes Accident; Driver Carelessly Hits Utility Pole; Passengers Injured and Sent to Hospital</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, three American soldiers and a Western woman went to the Yellow Car Company on Rue Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession to rent a car. The company ordered Jiang Amei (28 years old, from Pudong) and his assistant, Hu Shaoying (19 years old, from Suzhou), to drive car No. 12054 to Minhang for sightseeing. When they were returning to Shanghai after the tour, the car crashed into a utility pole on the side of the road near Huiling School. The driver, Jiang Amei, suffered serious internal injuries on the spot. His assistant, Hu Shaoying, suffered minor facial injuries. Afterwards, they were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The four Westerners in the car were sent to Russian Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Carelessness at Cotton Shop in Dadongmen</h3>
<p>Cai Shunxing Cotton Shop at No. 33 Fuan Street, Zhaojia Road, inside Dadongmen City, Nanshi, was established by Cai Xingsheng from Dachang. It was founded in 1920 and has been in operation for fourteen years. The business has been able to maintain itself. His wife, Zhang, has a son and three daughters, and employs two partners. To their surprise, at around 5 AM yesterday morning, a loft downstairs in the shop suddenly caught fire. The police chief of the Third Precinct of the First District immediately informed the fire brigade to send vehicles to rescue. However, cotton is very flammable, so the fire was very fierce. Although the firefighters bravely rescued, the fire had already spread to the adjacent salted meat shop at No. 31, opened by Pan Caizhang from Ningbo, and the home of Liu Jingwan at No. 82, Alley 6, Mianjin Lane, causing heavy losses. After the fire was extinguished, Chief Jin Dianyuan detained the arsonist Cai Xingsheng and sent him to the General Bureau for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Record of the Re-election of the Ham Industry Association</h3>

<h3>What is Heard About the Panchen Lama's Medical and Dental Care: Dr. Huang Bingji, Doctor of Dental Science</h3>
<p>In recent days, newspapers have reported that the Panchen Lama came to Shanghai for medical and dental treatment.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Recently, I read the report on page 13 of the fourth page of your newspaper on the 10th of this month, in the local news column, with the headline "Local Tyrants Collude with Police Station Chief to Set Up Red Pill Organization," and the situation described in it is mostly inconsistent with the facts. The Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Mr. Wen, received two anonymous letters a few days ago, saying that there are many places in the area of the first station of the fifth district where red pills are sold and where people can smoke red pills. He immediately ordered the detective team to send detective leader Chen Fucai to investigate and arrest them strictly. At about 5:00 PM on the 7th of this month, detective leader Chen Fucai led many detectives to the station and asked to send police to cooperate in handling the matter. The chief of this station immediately sent police officer Tang Xixiang to go with them. They searched the addresses, but found nothing. Only in front of the building on Delin West Lane Road, Dongbaoxing Road, a smoking lamp, a pipe, and 25 red pills were seized on the spot, and Liu Ziye, Liu Linshi, Ni Bing, Shang Zhenjiang, and the police chief Yuan Fuchen and Wang Futian of this station were arrested. It was found that Shang Zhenjiang used to be a petitioning policeman at the Hong Kong Grand Theater. Later, the theater stopped performing and there was no need for a petitioning policeman, so he applied for cancellation in May, which was approved by this station.</p>
<p>The theater, and did not continue to ask for a petitioning policeman. According to police chiefs Yuan Fuchen and Wang Futian, they went to the tailor shop to get clothes and did not know that there was a place for people to smoke red pills. They happened to be there and were mistakenly involved in the arrest. However, although the police chiefs were police officers, even if there was no act of shielding or smoking red pills, there was still suspicion. In addition to handing over the police chiefs and all the witnesses to detective leader Chen Fucai to be taken to the bureau for interrogation, the chief of this station has already requested punishment for failing to supervise and detect the matter. He is deeply afraid that the rumors are false and will damage his reputation. He should communicate with you to correct it. This is respectfully addressed to the chief writer of Shenbao, the first station of the fifth district of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, June 12.</p>

The Preparatory Committee of the China Pilot Association in this city has translated an article from the China Review Weekly and announced it to the people of the country, refuting the arguments of foreign newspapers. The statement says: In the editorial of the April issue of the Oriental Affairs Monthly, there was a lengthy discussion on this issue. The paper cited many treaties signed between China and the powers as the basis for the debate, intending to confuse the readers who do not have accurate knowledge of the fact that foreign pilots at Chinese treaty ports, how and when they were formed, and how they were able to be compared with the hardworking and experienced Chinese pilots. It also criticized the newly promulgated pilotage management regulations of the Chinese government, nothing more than to echo the foreign pilots in Shanghai and increase their arrogance, and vaguely to speak for the consular corps. The monthly also indiscriminately attacked the declaration issued by the Preparatory Committee of the China Pilot Association with biased eyes and fabrication. The reporter distorted the treaties and added his own absurd personal views, intending to reap unilateral benefits.</p>
<p>Only facts can reveal the truth of a matter. Therefore, we must have a true understanding of China's situation a century ago in order to understand the treaties cited. For example, the treaty signed in Huangpu on October 14, 1884, is a document that, today, unless you refer to books of historical events, it can be said that no human can correctly interpret it. It must be known that China at that time had only five ports open to foreign trade, and foreign pilots had not yet reached these five ports. The entry and exit of all foreign ships at these ports depended entirely on Chinese pilots. However, for some reason, foreign ships often could not find Chinese pilots at will, and the pilotage fees were not determined. This is why the words "foreign ships have the right to hire pilots" and "the issue of pilotage fees should be regulated by Chinese officials in consultation with foreign consular corps" were inserted into the treaty. According to this, the so-called special regulations are only limited to the pilotage prices of Chinese people. Moreover, the pilot mentioned here clearly refers to Chinese people and foreigners, because China has no jurisdiction over foreigners. It would be ridiculous to say that the powers have therefore allowed China to exercise its jurisdiction over foreign pilots. Foreign pilots invaded Chinese ports far after China signed various treaties. Did not the late Sir Robert Hart report this fact to the Prime Minister's Office in 1867 (that is, the seventh year of Tongzhi)? From September 10 of the same year, including from May 30, 1866, to May 11 of the following year, there were a total of 203 pilots in all trading ports (including 103 Chinese, 40 British, 35 Americans, 10 Portuguese, 6 Danes, 6 Swiss, 2 Dutch, and 1 Austrian). The report also included a statement saying that although according to international law, the right to pilotage along the Chinese coast should be reserved for Chinese pilots only, according to the current situation, it is necessary to formulate temporary regulations to jointly manage Chinese and foreign pilots. Subsequently, Hart was ordered to draft these regulations, which were submitted to the Prime Minister's Office for approval and publication. Regarding this, there was no formal report on whether Hart had consulted with the ministers of the powers at that time. Even if there was, we cannot recognize it, because the regulations have become a form of agreement. The regulations clearly state that it is an order or regulation of the Prime Minister's Office, which is self-explanatory. We　know that only sacred laws have permanent properties, and these regulations of 1868 are already 66 years old, how can they be unchangeable? They should have been revised or re-ordered long ago. These regulations may have been reluctantly applied in the past, but in wartime, they endanger China's national defense. Moreover, since the implementation of the regulations, China has repeatedly signed conventions with the powers, the nature of which conflicts with the regulations. Therefore, they are no longer applicable today. Regarding the former item, an example is the Sino-French War of 1885. The following are excerpts from Mori's International Law and times,</p>
<p>In March 1885, the American Minister to Beijing, Yang, sent a telegram to the U.S. government regarding the Sino-French war at the time, saying, "The Chinese government opposes American pilots piloting French warships. Should it be stopped?" U.S. Secretary of State Bai Yade replied by telegram, "The intention is very good, but we cannot stop our citizens from privately taking risks to enter into private contracts, which are not prohibited by national law, nor can they be ordered to return to court by the consul."

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>How to Take Reading Notes 丨丨 Reply to Mr. Wang Shaohua</h3>
<p>Previously, in the "Discussion on Reading Methodology," we briefly discussed the method of taking notes. Recently, Mr. Wang Shaohua has raised this question again in his letter, saying:</p>
<p>"......According to the elders, 'One must take notes when reading.' However, we know that taking notes is too uneconomical in terms of time. We must see a considerable extent before we become interested and start copying. How much time does this waste! We amateur self-learners value reading time as if it were gold. Moreover, as copying accumulates, the number of volumes will surely be considerable, and it will take a lot of time to look at them a second time. If we use this precious time to read other new books, we may gain more knowledge. Therefore, I feel that taking notes is a bit of a losing proposition, isn't it? But the elders say so, which makes me hesitate. Please, experienced gentlemen, give me some advice."</p>
<p>Indeed, many people feel that taking notes is too uneconomical in terms of time, and that reading other books with the time spent taking notes would be more beneficial. This kind of doubt is very common. However, the time spent taking notes is not wasted as you say, because while we should be aggressive in seeking knowledge, we must also take defense into account. Taking notes is a kind of rear-guard work, which systematizes and deepens the knowledge we have already acquired. Conversely, if a person cannot digest the knowledge he has obtained, extract the essence, eliminate the dross, and deepen it, then no matter how much he absorbs, it is like a marauding bandit trying to conquer the world, only attacking and not defending, which is useless. At most, we can only give him the label of "bookworm" that we discussed a few days ago. If we turn over the arranged type of a printing plate and mix them up, it will completely lose the function of the printing plate and become just a pile of type.</p>
<p>We now study and read books with much more convenience than the ancients. It is difficult to say that various sciences are still being created and continuously researched, but they have all established a system. Therefore, those who are new to a certain discipline should first read the introductory books of that discipline, and should thoroughly understand the general concepts of that discipline described in the introduction, and be able to remember the key points. Taking notes is to condense the vast aspects into a few short sentences, making it easier for you to remember and more economical for you.</p>
<p>Usually, most notes are taken using the summary method, extracting the important points of a book according to chapters, as if making a condensed version. Although this is the most clumsy method, it is very useful for beginners because it can train readers to grasp the core of each problem and concentrate the reader's memory, preventing waste.</p>
<p>A further method of taking notes is to avoid copying directly from the book as much as possible, which is to say that one can add one's own reflections. After we have finished reading a book, we should first clarify the content or object of study in that discipline, then carefully recall this content, and then start taking notes. Therefore, the effort spent on taking notes is 70% "thinking" and only 30% "writing." This is the principle of making summaries.</p>
<p>Next, we will discuss the specific methods of taking this type of notes. First, we can briefly describe the name, catalog, introduction, conclusion, page number, publication date, author's position, and time spent reading the book. Then, we can write down the content of the book, according to what we remember, in our own sentences. We do not have to adhere to the format of the original book; we should write according to our own convenience and opinions. The original book may divide a matter into several chapters due to length or separate the descriptions of one part from another for the sake of narrative convenience, but what we want to obtain is systematic knowledge and an overview. Therefore, we can abandon cumbersome and fragmented narratives and connect things that are discussed separately. As for the method of narration, the more concise the better, but important content cannot be omitted. If you are very interested, writing a little more is fine.</p>
<p>No matter what book it is, we cannot say that it is completely flawless. No matter how serious, it is common to not understand certain points when reading a book on a certain subject for the first time. In fact, readers' disagreements and doubts about the author's views, and the inability to thoroughly understand certain parts, are inevitable. If you encounter this kind of problem and cannot solve it, then don't over-repress your own views and blindly follow the book. After you have described the content, you can record these questions one by one. This can serve as the focus of your further research in the future. The reason why our interest in studying gradually increases is that the deeper the research, the more questions there are. To solve these problems, you must do further research, and therefore, your academic achievements will naturally become more in-depth. Therefore, this part is also very necessary in notes.</p>
<p>In short, taking notes helps you systematize and deepen the knowledge you have gained and keep it for future reference. Its main purpose is to focus on defense. The ancients said that doing scholarship is like "fighting a hard battle to the death," which is very reasonable. It would be a big mistake if we thought that the time spent on the defensive fortifications of the rear guard was not worth it compared to the offensive.</p>

At exactly 3 o'clock, Van Stoddard Bro led the crowd to the auditorium, stood up, and delivered the opening speech, saying that China can express extremely profound meanings with extremely simple brush and ink, full of charm and demeanor.

<h3>Japanese Observation Notes of the Chinese Children's Education Society (8)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>Colonization Education at the Immigration Training Center</p>
<p>Japan is a small island in the sea, with a territory less than one-seventh of that of our country, and the proportion of the population is difficult to compare. The population of Japan proper is about 60 million, with an average annual increase of about 750,000, and a military increase of 14 per 1,000. The population density per square mile is 260, excluding the major cities. Although there are many mountains, there is no mountain that is not green and no land that is not cultivated (when we passed through the villages of Beppu, every inch of land along the road was used for production), the cultivable land accounts for only one-seventh of the total area of the country, and the supply is still insufficient. Moreover, women are also working in society. Waiters in restaurants and hostels, ticket sellers in cars and trams, shop assistants in various shops, and even men's bathrooms all rely on women's services, which leaves some men unemployed. Last year, there were 45 million unemployed workers worldwide. The United States has a large population, and there are 14,000,000 unemployed. The next is Britain and Japan. Japan has 530,000 unemployed. If the proportion of the population is considered, the number should be astonishing. Although it is warm, they cry cold, and although the year is prosperous, they cry hungry. The whole country is in an uproar. No wonder its colonial policy has become more and more urgent. Therefore, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs was established, and the Colonial School was upgraded from the Taiwan Association School to the Colonial University. Its main target is none other than us. We should resist the aggression of airships and cannons, and we should also be careful to guard against the violence of colonial education.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Immigration Training Center is to train ordinary people to prepare for the necessary skills and knowledge to cultivate in South America, and to enable them to live and work in Brazil. The school was founded by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and is directly managed by the Minister of Colonial Affairs, Ryuichiro Nagai. The training courses are nothing more than alphabets, simple language, etiquette, travel common sense, and medical common sense. The training period is extremely short, reportedly only eight days. Two trainings are scheduled each month, with 700 people each time, and more than 10,000 people each year. The most difficult thing during training is children who go with their parents. In this short period of time, it is very difficult to obtain good results.</p>
<p>To enter the Immigration Training Center, ordinary people must first see the government post advertisements everywhere to recruit immigrants to Brazil. The advertisements are large and numerous. We often see them when we travel in the interior. The advertisements also contain encouragement and explanations. Each person can get a subsidy of 50 yuan, and families are especially welcome to go, so that these people can become permanent colonists, open up a fixed paradise for the motherland, and provide a decent way out for the unemployed. When these people have a firm heart to go abroad, there will be so-called overseas lectures to engage in preliminary education. Then, the Overseas Immigration Association will handle the procedures and send them to the school. The most important condition for entering the school is a physical examination. If trachoma is found in a physical defect, they will definitely not be qualified to enter the school, because the United States refuses to allow trachoma patients to land. Trachoma is rarely seen in Europe and the United States, but it is especially common in Japan and also in our country. The world calls it "Eastern disease." They are all caused by infection. In addition to the physical examination, preventive injections are also given, fearing that they will get sick during the tropical journey. Preventive work can be said to be thorough.</p>
<p>The school has two four-story buildings with 860 beds. Each family can live in one room. There is one treatment room and one clinic. Medical treatment is completely free. There is one examination room for examining feces, etc. There is one supply yard for immigrants' supplies, and one men's and women's bathroom each. (According to Japan's influence from China and European and American customs in recent years, men's and women's bathing is completely separated. Even in inland hotels and public bathhouses, except for the beach sand baths in Beppu and the hot spring baths in Atami, men and women do not bathe together. Is this kind of reform evolution or degeneration? It all depends on the wise seeing wisdom and the benevolent seeing benevolence.) There are several bedrooms, and each bedroom has 12 beds. There are many unsanitary aspects. When we went to the top floor, we saw a large photograph of a ship, with the words "Pioneer of South American Immigration." This ship is the Kanagawa Maru. On March 10, Meiji 45, it carried 1,500 people and sailed from Kobe. The well-wishers were endless on the road. From this, we can see the general history of immigration to South America.</p>
<h3>Vocational Education in Hyogo Elementary School</h3>
<p>After visiting Kitano Elementary School and Kobe Immigration Training Center on the morning of April 4, the local municipal government hosted a lunch at the Central Pavilion. It is said that it is very rare for the government to host foreign guests. This time, we were very grateful for being treated so well. When we went to the banquet, we were afraid that they would ask unavoidable questions, so we were all on our guard. When we first arrived at the port, one or two newspapers had published reports on Sino-Japanese friendship, the Chinese government sending a large number of investigators to Japan, and saying that we were very surprised by the greatness of Nagasaki's construction. In fact, the China Children's Education Society is entirely a private legal group. The desolation and coldness of Nagasaki are no more than our Wusong. What is friendship? What is surprise? This kind of trick is nothing more than to cover the eyes and ears of the world and use it for external propaganda. Fortunately, the representative sent by the Kobe Municipal Government that day was still witty, starting with perfunctoriness and ending with perfunctoriness.</p>

<h3>Soccer and Swimming on Jinan's Eighth Anniversary | No Gains for Either Side |</h3>
<p>Basketball: 46 to 26, Jinan Wins over Daxia</p>
<p>Jinan University held two demonstration matches in soccer and basketball yesterday afternoon to celebrate its eighth anniversary. The Youyou soccer team and the Daxia basketball team were invited to play. However, due to the hot weather, the game was bland and lacked excitement. As a result, the soccer game ended in a draw with no gains for either side, while Jinan won the basketball game with a score of 46 to 26 against Daxia. Tennis was not held due to unsuccessful negotiations. The situation of yesterday's game is briefly described below:</p>
<h3>(1) Soccer Game</h3>
<p>The soccer game started at 4:00 PM. The players on both sides had not played for a long time, and their skills were rusty. In addition, under the strong sunlight, each player was panting and exhausted. The game passed in a bland atmosphere. At the beginning of the game, Jinan took a breath and the offensive was very strong. Luo Haiguang led the three armies and approached the enemy's goal, but there was no chance to take advantage of due to the strict defense. After a while, Youyou counterattacked, but also returned without success. No gains were made in the first half. In the second half, both sides made major troop adjustments. Youyou veteran Huang Ruihua also retired due to lack of energy and was replaced by Liang Shutang. The offense and defense of both sides were very balanced. Until the end, they still failed to open the record. The game ended in a friendly atmosphere. Referee: Mei Zhengbao.</p>

<h3>(2) Basketball Game</h3>
<p>The basketball demonstration match between Daxia and Jinan started at 5:00 PM. Liu Zhenzhong, my country's distant sports representative, also played for Daxia and served as a defender. The performance was excellent, but the whole team lacked connections, which led to a crushing defeat. At the beginning of the game, both</p>
<p>Parties held their ground for a long time, up to ten minutes. Suddenly, Jinan gained momentum, Han Zhenyuan opened the record, and the flames were soaring. The score increased steadily. When Jinan scored eight points, Daxia started by Chen Zhaoqiu hitting a goal. The first half ended with 26 to 5. In the second battle, the Daxia players tried their best to cheer up and scored repeatedly, but unfortunately, they lost too much in the first half, and as a result, they lost to the opponent by 26 to 46. Referee: Wu Jiasang.</p>

<h3>Dispute over North China Swimming Competition</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 13th) This year's North China Swimming Competition was originally planned to be held in Ping, but due to the poor facilities of the Zhongnanhai swimming pool and financial difficulties, it was decided not to hold the competition, but Yuan Lidun and others still insisted on holding it, and the dispute was fierce. The Sports Federation will hold a meeting in the next few days to decide.</p>
<h3>Lawn Tennis League: China Club Beat French Business Club Yesterday | Result: 9 to 6, Prospects Quite Optimistic | Defu and Pan Lifeifei Beat Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng</h3>
<p>In yesterday's lawn tennis league match between China Club and French Business Club, it was expected beforehand that China was extremely dangerous. The French businessmen are full of talents this year and want to dominate, but the result was completely unexpected. China won by 9 to 6. Based on this result, the future of China Club is still very optimistic.</p>
<p>Yesterday's first group match was the most exciting. The French Business Club was represented by Pan Lifeifei and Defu, who are famous at home and abroad. Their strength is no less than that of Pan Lifeifei and Carlson. It is not easy for Qiu Feihai and Xing Wang Wenzheng to win a set. However, Wang lacked qualifications and could not connect. However, the performance of both sides was very energetic. Pan De</p>
<p>The two wielded their broadswords and attacked on both sides. Qiu Feihai tried his best to parry and won the first set with 6 to 3 first. After a fierce battle of 7 to 9, he lost the second set. The opponent became more and more handy in the third set, and Qiu Wang had almost no ability to parry, losing five games in a row, which was very easy. He finally lost by 2 to 6.</p>
<p>The second group, Ma Anquan and Guo Yujie, also lost by 1 to 2. The opponents, Brunsch and Mays, are veterans. If Ma Guo can proceed carefully, it is not difficult to win. Unfortunately, there are too many suicides and they cannot control others. The third group, Zhang Dingzhao and Zhou Guanjun, were not angry at all. They subdued their opponents with calmness and stability. The score was a straight three, which was the biggest contributor to China yesterday.</p>
<p>In the fourth and fifth groups, China Club also won by 2 to 1. The competition time for the fourth group was very long. It was composed of Tu Kaiyuan and Sun Linfang. The opponent was mediocre. With Tu Sun's technology, it is not difficult to win completely. The second set was 6 to 8, which was completely due to carelessness. The same is true for the fifth group, Tang Yongchun and Zheng Zirong. They won the first and third sets with 6 to 3 and 6 to 2, but lost the second set with 0 to 6. In total, China won three to two sets, with a score of nine to six. The scores of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Qiu Feihai {6 to 2} Pan Lifeifei Lost one to two</p>
<p>Qian Wenzheng {7 to 9} Defu</p>
<p>{2 to 6}</p>
<p>(2) Ma Anquan {2 to 6} Brunsch Lost one to two</p>
<p>Guo Zijie {7 to 5} Mays</p>
<p>{2 to 6}</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Dingzhao {6 to 3} Krenov Three Wins</p>
<p>Zhou Guanjun {6 to 4} Turner</p>
<p>{6 to 4}</p>
<p>(4) Tu Kaiyuan {6 to 3} Fu Jieshi Win two to one</p>
<p>Sun Linfang {6 to 8} Kerr Mei</p>
<p>{6 to 3}</p>
<p>(5) Tang Yongchun {6 to 3} Lieklei Win two to one</p>
<p>Zheng Zirong {○ to 6} Lusenwei</p>
<p>{6 to 1}</p>
<h3>Hua Fenggang Wins Youth Association Handball Championship</h3>
<p>Six Players Get to Participate in Graded Tournaments</p>
<p>The Youth Association's newcomer handball competition has ended in the past few days. Hua Fenggang won the championship by defeating Qu Zhenhu with 21 to 15 and 21 to 8. In the first game, Qu showed his skills in smashing and saving the ball, but his left arm, strength, and chasing position were not as good as Hua's, so he was defeated in the second game. However, both players' skills are quite advanced, and there is great hope in the future. Therefore, Hua Fenggang, Qu Zhenhu, Yu Guanghan, Ma Xinyuan, Yuan Zongji, and Ding Bingyao will all be able to participate in the association's next Yize Cup graded handball tournament.</p>

<h3>The China-America Tobacco Company's Special Edition on the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>A Jumbo Edition Published Today</p>
<p>Mr. Jing Yimeng, General Manager of the China-America Tobacco Company and publisher of the China-America Monthly, felt indignant at the illegal dissolution of the Far Eastern Games by the Philippines and Japan. He also believed that the lack of widespread sports participation in our country could not be effectively addressed without the unanimous promotion by the entire nation. On the day after the conclusion of the Far Eastern Games, he urged the Shanghai Municipal Authorities and sports reporters from major newspapers to compile a comprehensive review of the Far Eastern Games. The China-America Tobacco Company spent a large sum of money to print and distribute these reviews in major Shanghai newspapers, which were well-received by readers. Now that the Far Eastern Games have concluded, and the future remains uncertain, it is necessary to publish a special edition to review the past and look forward to the future. Therefore, the China-America Monthly’s third issue will be a special edition on the Far Eastern Games, encompassing everything. The richness of its content is self-evident. A special column for discussions on the Far Eastern Games has been opened, featuring insightful talks by important representatives and coaches from our country who participated in the Games. The truth of the Games is exposed without reservation, making it an indispensable reference for those concerned about sports in our country. The book is scheduled to be published today, with a jumbo edition priced at 20 cents per copy, distributed by the Modern Bookstore. Holders of Guanghua Brand Cigarette Coupons can redeem them at 590 Nanjing Road.</p>

<h3>National Product Industry Should Pay Attention to Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>— Yang Yan</p>
<p>The outlet for national products is not only in various parts of the country, but should also be promoted in foreign markets. In this era of economic panic spreading across the world, every country is desperately promoting the sales of its products, using all kinds of methods and thinking of all kinds of plans, both seeking to boost the sales of its own products and restricting the import of foreign goods. Therefore, even Japanese goods, which are best at exploiting every opportunity, are now encountering obstacles everywhere, facing difficulties in finding outlets. In this situation, the only way for our national product manufacturers to save themselves is to first avoid domestic competition and focus on foreign trade. It must be understood that infighting and jealousy among peers are past bad habits that should absolutely not exist today. Everyone in the national product industry should stand together, taking the same steps to respond to the current crisis. Through cooperation among the same industry, and even cooperation among different industries, striving for lower costs and exquisite products, China's national products will not find it difficult to compete in foreign markets in a few years, perhaps three to five. Recently, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo went to Nanyang to investigate industries. His task was not only to connect the country's production sector with foreign consumers, so that our national products can expand their market, but also to enable overseas Chinese in Nanyang and the local government to have a kind of appropriate exchange. After returning to China, Chen strongly stated that Nanyang's commerce has considerable development prospects, and that most of the local overseas Chinese lean towards the motherland, especially being very enthusiastic about national products, unanimously happy to use them; unfortunately, national product manufacturers still do not have strong organizations, so that they cannot fully expand the foreign market. Overseas Chinese in Nanyang all say that they are very eager to consume more national products, but the goods often do not suit the needs of the local area, such as the size of fabrics, the decoration of goods, and the psychology of users. This is the reason why national products cannot sell well in Nanyang. After hearing Chen's report, our manufacturers should uniformly pay attention to the selection of products, catering to the preferences of various places in Nanyang, in order to expand outlets, especially hoping that many manufacturers will jointly go to various places in Nanyang to conduct practical investigations, to establish friendly contacts, and bring various products to hold exhibitions, study their preferences, meet their needs, improve manufacturing, and facilitate transportation. Manufacturers can imitate the Japanese approach, specializing in the production of goods that sell well in Nanyang. If this can be done, then how difficult is it for our national products to compete with Japan and other countries in foreign countries? It depends on the vision and courage of the manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Industrialists Join Hands to Promote National Products</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Qingdao Industrial Inspection Group came to Shanghai on May 16th, and arranged a daily schedule to visit various factories, lasting for over ten days. Choucheng and Mr. Wu Shuchen, an executive of the Chinese Industrial Federation, accompanied them. Therefore, all the banquets in various places were also on the list of invitees. However, the talks at the banquet in Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant on the 24th were the most valuable.</p>
<p>On that day, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Chinese Vocational School, the Chinese Chemical Industry Society, the Chinese Iron Factory, the Chinese Enamel Factory, the American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory, and the Wuhe Weaving Factory jointly hosted a public banquet. Mr. Huang Renzhi was recommended to deliver a welcome speech. In addition to praising the members of the inspection group for their enthusiasm in promoting national products, Mr. Huang also said that during this period of severe national crisis, the four words "Industrial Development to Save the Nation" should be firmly adhered to and not forgotten by the industrial sector. The connection between the industrial sectors of Qingdao and Shanghai has been more than a day. Both sides have formed inspection groups to visit factories, and Shanghai has even gathered products from various factories to open an exhibition in Qingdao last year. All achievements were the best compared to other places. From this point alone, it can be seen that the Qingdao compatriots' enthusiasm for using national products is better than other ports. The so-called connection is not the connection between the Zhang and Li families, nor the connection between the A and B matters, but should have a concrete organization, roughly divided into two types: (1) the connection between the same industry and the same industry, regardless of region, and (2) the connection regardless of whether it is the same industry or not, limited by region. I hope that the gentlemen of the inspection group will not just come to Shanghai to visit factories this time, and then return to Qingdao to make a report and be done with it. They should take this opportunity to think of a concrete organization. This matter is not only related to industry, but also to international politics. Starting from today, industrial leaders from Qingdao and Shanghai should start joining hands to work hard for the development of industry and the promotion of national products, in order to plug the loopholes and save the country's fate. The head of the War Police Corps said in his reply: "Universal Education and Industrial Development" are the key to saving the country today. The other day, I visited the Chinese Vocational School and saw that the students used both their hands and brains, were strong and hardworking, which was different from ordinary schools. It can be seen that the seniors present have a thorough understanding of industrial research, which is admirable. The twentieth century is an era of commercial warfare. Qingdao was previously in the hands of Germany and Japan, and there was no way to talk about industry. After the recovery, it was gradually reorganized, and there were still many foreign factories. Taking the yarn factory as an example, Mr. Wu Bosheng, the deputy head of our group, has a Huaxin Yarn Factory in Qingdao, while the Japanese have six yarn factories, engaging in dumping. It goes without saying that the situation is difficult with one against six. Fortunately, the workers in Qingdao all have patriotic hearts. In the previous year, foreign factories went on strike for several months, while Chinese factories worked as usual. Cooperation between labor and management can resist foreign aggression. I hope that Shanghai entrepreneurs will go to Qingdao to open factories, to be a new force, and fight with foreign merchants. Qingdao is not only beautiful and convenient for transportation, but also all workers have simple lives and can endure hardships. In the past, they went to the three northeastern provinces to make a living, but since the September 18th Incident, they have all returned to Shandong. There are more people than jobs, and they only seek to be warm and full. The wages are much lower than in Shanghai. Mr. Huang's proposal is very insightful. I would like to use the host's wine to thank you all. Then, Mr. Ren Shigang proposed that both the guests and the hosts should introduce their history, as a preliminary hand-in-hand. On the guest side, Mr. Jingtang was asked to tell each member's personal business one by one, and the introduced person stood up so that everyone at the table could recognize them. On the host side, Mr. Pan Yangyao was asked to introduce them in order, and he also explained everyone's past history in detail. This method is more effective and interesting than exchanging business cards and exchanging pleasantries. Afterwards, Mr. Wu Bosheng said that running a factory should not only think about making profits, but should also have a compassionate heart, so that fellow compatriots can all have food to eat. Everyone said that this is what the Buddhists call having no ego. If we can be like this, we can all reach the other shore. Speaking Buddhist language in a Buddhist place, the scenery and emotions are intertwined, and everyone is happy.</p>
<h3>Dragon Boat Festival and National Products</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival is here, really, the Dragon Boat Festival every year, in one more day, it is coming again! In the few days before and after the Dragon Boat Festival, our Chinese custom is to give gifts to each other. Originally, this kind of custom, from the perspective of enlightened people, should of course be eliminated and abolished. However, in the minds of ordinary people, it seems that they still firmly refuse to break it, especially the housewives who are in charge of household affairs. It is even more difficult to eliminate and abolish. This is really a wasteful thing! From the perspective of reducing the national economy, of course, we think it is unreasonable. However, if we stand from the perspective of promoting national products, it is an excellent opportunity and time to promote national products. As long as housewives can understand the importance of promoting national products and purchasing national products, and understand that promoting national products and purchasing national products is the housewife's natural duty and work hard to implement it, then on this day of the Dragon Boat Festival, we can call it the National Products Festival. This is really an issue that housewives and the national product industry should jointly pay attention to.</p>
<p>How can housewives promote national products and purchase national products during the Dragon Boat Festival? My opinion is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Gifts of national products: I think that giving gifts during the Dragon Boat Festival can be saved as much as possible. If it is unavoidable, then the goal of giving gifts to relatives and friends should be to purchase national products. At the same time, when purchasing, you must go to reliable national product factories and national product companies, so that you will not be wronged and deceived. Otherwise, the deceptive methods of unscrupulous merchants are endless. Maybe we will be deceived by the altered enemy goods!</p>
<p>(2) Receiving gifts of national products: The meaning of giving gifts is only to express the feelings between relatives and friends! However, there is also the meaning of promoting national products in it. Therefore, those who give gifts must purchase national products to give to relatives and friends. However, those who receive gifts should especially pay attention to whether the gifts sent are national products? If they are national products, then you can thank them a few times and accept them. If they are not national products, we can return a piece of paper to him, explaining the reason for not accepting. If everyone can do this, then those who send non-national product gifts will definitely not buy foreign goods to send people next time. This effect is really great. I hope that all Chinese intellectuals will implement this method and implement this proposition, which will be of great help to the future of the national product movement and the promotion of national products.</p>
<p>Alas! The Dragon Boat Festival is really a good opportunity to promote national products. I hope that everyone will pay attention to this issue together, to create one more outlet and one more opportunity for national product promotion.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "Japanese Goods Encountering Obstacles Everywhere"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>"Japanese goods," "Japanese goods," this painful and terrifying term, naturally all of us Chinese people with a little bit of blood, whether we see it in the newspaper or hear it from friends, will always stand up with an attitude of anger and a psychology of hatred. There is no other reason than that it has given us a very deep historical proof of its malice, and we can definitely recognize it as a kind of most poisonous snake. If its disturbance is truly rampant, it is all enough to endanger the collapse of our social economy and the stability of the national economy and people's livelihood. Regarding this monster's daily actions, it particularly arouses our attention and 120% attention.</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen in the newspaper a headline that "Japanese goods are encountering obstacles everywhere." It turns out that its content is this: "The Egyptian government, in view of the recent drastic dumping of Japanese goods, with the most resolute attitude, ordered its consul in Kobe, Mr. Houqi, to protest to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, intending to adjust Japan's one-sided trade. At the same time, the Consul of Haiti in Kobe, Mr. Gerj, also notified the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry to urge Japanese merchants to purchase Haitian products in order to adjust the balance of trade between the two sides. Otherwise, Haiti will prohibit the import of Japanese goods, with an even tougher attitude. In addition, Jamaica and other British colonies have also increased tariffs one after another, banning the import of Japanese cotton fabrics, expressing unified action." From here, we can more deeply see the fierceness of Japanese goods dumping in the world market, but the news of the 27-nation boycott of Japanese goods movement heard a few months ago and the current "Japanese goods encountering obstacles everywhere" is really his most serious revenge.</p>
<p>However, here, we have three very deep thoughts. Originally, the countries of the world are not easy to invade. None of them are willing to be subjected to the blitzkrieg of dumping with a meaning of resistance, and they have already raised tariffs, foreign exchange management, import restrictions, and implemented anti-dumping duties to make the most powerful sanctions. But looking back at our country, the flooding of enemy goods is still the same. According to yesterday's newspaper, in the Sino-Japanese trade in April, the import of Japanese goods has an even more sharply increased trend compared to March. They have built high and hard barriers to make Japanese goods encounter obstacles everywhere, but we are just like mercury spilling on the ground. The enemy goods are rolling in and are ubiquitous, causing the national product industry to be even more threatened and unable to breathe forever. What is the reason? It is a "painful mystery"!</p>
<h3>National Product News of the Week</h3>
<p>(1) Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo has returned to China after inspecting industries in Nanyang. This trip has been very successful in promoting national products.</p>
<p>(2) The Shandong National Product Promotion Association resolved to force the promotion of national products, and sent a letter to the municipal government, limiting each merchant to clear foreign goods within three months and specialize in selling national products. Those who pass off foreign goods as national goods will be fined double the price.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese raw silk was officially auctioned on the American Exchange.</p>
<p>(4) Chinese goods companies in Changsha, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, and Guangzhou have been preparing to be completed and are scheduled to open within two months.</p>
<p>(5) The Guangdong Unified Sugar Industry Plan has been approved and announced by the provincial government.</p>
<p>(6) The International Trade Bureau has been introducing domestic fruits to overseas promotion with considerable success.</p>
<p>(7) The National Iron Exhibition in Peiping has been open for half a month, and the sales of national products have reached 184,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(8) The Northwest National Product Mobile Exhibition was exhibited in Kaifeng and then exhibited in Zhengzhou, with even better results. It is scheduled to go to Luoyang on the 24th to hold an exhibition.</p>
<p>(9) The Chinese Industrial Federation requested the Central Aviation School to use domestic light bulbs, and the school has replied that it will do so.</p>
<p>(10) The Songjiang National Product Exhibition opened on June 10.</p>
<p>In short, at the present stage, the dumping of Japanese goods has become as deep as any scar, and after it encounters obstacles in the world market, the inevitable result is that it will choose the most easily invaded China to transfer its crisis losses as much as possible. Naturally, its subsequent dumping on China will follow the line of sight and concentrate. Then, for the sake of preventing problems before they occur, how will our compatriots all over the country follow in the footsteps of various countries to make the most effective sanctions on this serious issue?</p>
<p>Short news: Tianlu Shoe Store at the entrance of Banzhang Lane on Great Malu, as the only famous shoe store in Shanghai, is well-equipped and is the crown of the industry. Styles, whether new or old, are all sold. Now that the store is holding a price reduction period, all domestic raw material shoes, with the enthusiasm of promoting national products, are specially reduced in price to show promotion.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Imperial Fragrance Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Before the collapse of the Manchu Qing Empire, there were certain laws and regulations for clothing. All officials and their wives had to obey them. However, these laws and regulations were not inhumane, but simply prescribed different styles of clothing according to the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. And each season was represented by a flower. In winter, the yellow wintersweet flower was used; in spring, the peony flower; in summer, the lotus flower; and in autumn, the chrysanthemum flower. All the female officials in the palace and the wives of those courtiers outside the palace had to embroider the flower representing the season on the clothes they wore each season if they wanted to embroider flowers. For example, in spring, they had to embroider peonies, otherwise not only would it be out of fashion, but they would also be charged with disobeying the imperial decree!</p>
<p>In addition to the floral decorations on the clothes, the style of the clothes was also prescribed according to the different seasons. For example, in winter, although everyone had to wear fur clothes, sometimes they only had to wear fur clothes with exposed fur edges, while other times they had to wear fur clothes that were fully lined with fur. Even the types of fur were not all the same. There were four types prescribed, all of which were changed according to the warmth of the weather. These four types of fur were: silver fox, gray fox, fox, and sable.</p>
<p>At the beginning of winter, the Empress Dowager would issue an edict, which was usually issued overnight. This edict would say something like "From tomorrow onwards, everyone should wear fur." Of course, the content of this edict would not be so simple. According to the rules, there would be a long official article, but in summary, it would not go beyond the meaning of these two sentences. Therefore, every courtier probably had a lot of clothes hidden away, because when the Empress Dowager's edict was issued, they would have to put on their fur clothes when they went to court the next day, no matter what. If they were not prepared in peacetime, how could they have time to do so temporarily! (57)</p>
<h3>The So-Called Scientific Spirit Medium</h3>
<p>— Luo Er</p>
<p>Several male and female relatives and friends gathered together to discuss scientific spirit mediums.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu wanted to summon the spirit of her deceased nephew to talk to her because she missed him. In particular, she wanted him to say what he wanted to talk to her about when he was dying.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Er solemnly told a news story about the miracle of the spirit medium, which was miraculous!</p>
<p>"A colleague once asked the spirit medium for the winning number of the fifth phase of the aviation lottery. As a result, he got the answer of the number five at the end. After the lottery was drawn, this colleague did not win, but he also made a small profit, because he won a lot of same-number awards at the end one and end two. If you say it's not effective, then what is this all about!"</p>
<p>After hearing this, Mr. Fang Da shouted repeatedly, "There is also one of my classmates, which is even more strange. He asked the spirit medium to summon a living friend to talk. When the conversation was over, he announced that he had invited a living person, and everyone couldn't help but burst into laughter. At that moment, the spirit medium suddenly jumped ten feet high and heavily hit him on the head. What do you say!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu opened her eyes wide and kept shouting, "Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Effective! What an effective spirit! It should be hit! Good hit!"</p>
<p>"It's better to believe it exists than not to believe it exists." Mr. Lu Er nodded repeatedly, saying in his native dialect.</p>
<p>Mr. Fang Da was the most curious. The next day, he bought a pair of spirit mediums, and in the living room, he begged the immortals, invited the gods, and summoned souls, so sincere that he could touch heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Three fingers of different shapes pressed tightly on the spirit medium. Wait five minutes, no movement, wait ten minutes, no movement, wait fifteen minutes, no movement. Six eyes gradually turned red, and three fingers seemed to be trembling, but the spirit medium's body was pressed stiff.</p>
<p>Bang! Nothing! Dangling! Dangling! The spirit medium was angry, and suddenly jumped more than ten feet high, threw itself into the spittoon and died.</p>
<p>Only then did Mr. Fang Da angrily scold, "Damn it, damn it, making fun of me!"</p>
<h3>Unfilial Son Reads the Classic of Filial Piety</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Li Jinfang, the magistrate of Funing County, was the county magistrate who was admitted with the first place in Jiangsu Province. Since he became the magistrate of Funing, his political achievements have been quite good. Yesterday, a friend from Funing, Mr. Li, told me about Magistrate Li's punishment of the unfilial son, which was very interesting. I will record it as follows:</p>
<p>In the east city of Funing County, there is a Dong XX, who has served in the education sector and can be regarded as an intellectual. But he has a bad habit, which is that he is unfilial to his parents. He insults his father at will and scolds him arbitrarily. His father only has one son, so he doesn't care about him. Who knew that he would actually make progress and start asking his father for debt? Probably last year, he wrote a letter to his father, with the heading "XX sees the letter:" (his father's name) and the signature "written by the old master," with the content that he should quickly repay the money, otherwise he should write a note of debt. If he is unable to repay in the future, he must turn into a donkey to repay the debt of the old master in the next life. At that time, his father was very angry and immediately reported him to Magistrate Li for unfilial piety. Magistrate Li's purpose was to preserve the old morality, so after hearing about this, he grabbed him and put him in prison. He also bought a Classic of Filial Piety for Dong XX to read, and only released him after he repented. It is said that he is no longer like he used to be to his father!</p>
<p>There are many unfilial sons everywhere! If they can all be treated like this, it would be a very gratifying thing!</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Watching the Mourning Geese Bury Themselves to Guard the Territory; Bullets Pierce Strong Arms, Sprinkling Blood to Dye the Lonely City</p>
<p>At this time, he received the battalion commander's order to build up the village and the defensive works outside the south gate. Outside this south gate, there were already two temporary trenches. Fang was always afraid that the enemy's tanks would not be easy to resist, so he ordered Ziqiang to lead his own company of brothers to dig another dry trench outside the south gate, with branches and deer forks piled on the trench to block the enemy. Ziqiang stood on the earthen slope, looking down at his brothers digging the trench. Accidentally, he looked up and saw the old people and children of the village inside the stronghold walking towards the entrance. The old man he had entrusted was also walking slowly among them. He seemed to see Ziqiang standing on the slope paying attention to him, so he reached into his arms and took out a letter, waving it repeatedly in front of him. It seemed that he meant to indicate that he could take the letter to him. Ziqiang had nothing else to say, just watching him from afar. Because if he raised his hand to show anything, it would be seen by his brothers. He felt that he could not concentrate on military affairs, and still had to think about his family, which was a kind of laziness, so he did not move, but only watched with his eyes as if he did not know about this at all. The brothers who were working on the slope were all waiting quietly for the company commander to command. Now that they saw the company commander only staring at the road back to the south, maybe they were looking at the old people and children walking forward and thinking of home? Because of this, those who were carrying earth outwards, holding manure baskets, did not know where to pour it, and were also looking forward. Those who were digging earth with hoes on the slope, although they could not see the top, were also holding their hoes and raising their heads, looking up at the slope. One was like this, and everyone inevitably stopped working. Ziqiang accidentally turned his head and saw everyone in this situation, thinking to himself, this is terrible, a momentary negligence of five minutes almost caused a collective slack. So he did not question his brothers, but jumped down the slope, picked up a hoe, raised it high, and dug ten times. (408)</p>
<h3>The Dumpling Seller's Child</h3>
<p>— Liancheng</p>
<p>Still in the darkness of early morning, a sorrowful voice cries, "Dumplings! Dumplings! Dumplings!" from the mouth of a small child. This sound doesn't dissipate until the sun is high and the young masters and misses rise from their beds. It's been like this for almost a year, regardless of cold or heat, rain or shine.</p>
<p>Every time I hear this sound, I instinctively curse, "If you don't need sleep, why disturb others' sleep?"</p>
<p>Although I hate him intensely, I never have the courage to stop him when he cries out.</p>
<p>But for the past few days, I haven't heard this sound. I was glad, thinking I could finally sleep peacefully. It truly felt like regaining something precious. But things in this world rarely go as expected. Just as I was celebrating the end of the sleep disturbance, the "Dumplings! Dumplings!" sound disappeared, and another sound disrupting sleep appeared in its place. But compared to the previous one, this new sound is even more sorrowful and even more unbearable. The previous sound was a child's voice; now it's a woman's. Before, it was the selling cry of "Dumplings! Dumplings!"; now it's the weeping cry of "My child, my flesh!"</p>
<p>Ah! I've had enough! I've had enough! Bring back the original sound! But alas! The child no longer cries out.</p>

<h3>Random Jottings from a Southern Tour: Street Scenes in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>Fuzhou is a famous city in South China. It has a long street that stretches for several miles, with modern buildings lining both sides. Radios in the shops play popular Min tunes all day long to attract customers. Cars used by provincial officials to save time and shorten distances speed along smooth cement roads, with horns blaring everywhere. Combined, the unique clamor of the city forms a modern symphony. Women, too, are unwilling to lag behind; their clothing styles keep up with advanced Shanghai, and their demeanor and physique carry a southern charm. But is Fuzhou really as prosperous as people imagine? No, no, this massive city hasn't escaped the pervasive economic panic. The shadow of recession and decline has already enveloped it, just like many other cities.</p>
<p>Those who have been to Fuzhou probably know that Fuzhou's prosperity is simply based on commercial economy. Citizens have more opportunities for consumption, and less opportunity for production. Although there are many barefoot working women on the streets, this is not enough to hide the hunger of many stomachs. Many social evils are caused by poverty. In the park at dusk, there is no shortage of virtuous women taking leisurely strolls. But at the same time, under the bright electric lights, powdered-faced women are searching for the fate of their families. The power of hunger has made them bow their heads in helplessness. When a wave of despair washes over them, how dare they wail? They can only cast their weary gaze at the cement heads, because only the cement heads understand them.</p>
<p>Foreign Languages</p>
<p>"Nü xi ben ma? Xi gui wan? A sai a sai, a lü a lü." It's really maddening, this Fuzhou language. Not only Fuzhou, but the languages of all of Fujian are like foreign tongues. Hearing them makes your brain ache.</p>
<p>Those who arrive in Fuzhou for the first time—even those who have lived there for quite some time—all experience the difficulty of not being able to communicate. For example, if you want to hire a rickshaw, you can shout "Rickshaw! Rickshaw!" until your voice shakes the heavens, but the rickshaw puller acts as if he hasn't heard anything. Some even stare at you blankly, thinking you're suffering from some kind of madness. Buying things, asking for directions… isn't it all just as difficult? But the effort is often in vain. The other person will never understand what you mean, just as you can't understand them. A friend said to me, "We can accept not understanding foreign languages, but for Chinese people to not understand other Chinese people is unreasonable and unacceptable." But unreasonable things abound, and there are many of them. Isn't this a great disgrace to our own country?</p>
<p>I used to hear people say that the Fujian language sounds like bird calls, and I didn't dare believe it. Because I imagined that the Fujian language was at most like the difference between Northern Mandarin and Shanghai dialect. Although the accent is different, the pronunciation of the words only differs by half, so there is some resemblance when spoken. But in retrospect, "eat" is called "xi ben," and "yes" is called "a sai a sai." How many thousands of miles is that from the common Mandarin used throughout the country? It would not be an exaggeration to call this a foreign language.</p>
<p>But should this Min language, which is like a foreign tongue, be allowed to exist forever?</p>
<p>The Dingguang Pagoda</p>
<p>From any open field in Fuzhou, looking towards the city, as long as there are no tall buildings or dense forests obstructing your view, you will surely see two straight columns of smoke protruding into the sky amidst the deep and vast patterns woven by the multi-colored rooftops. They stand out like cranes among chickens, one white and one black. Although the black one also stings the eyes of tourists, it is often overlooked in conversation and memory. The white one is proud, like the White-Robed Avalokiteśvara, and is often on people's lips. This is the Dingguang Pagoda that I'm going to talk about.</p>
<p>Like giant beetles, many ancient steles stand on the mountain, and poems commemorating Qi Jiguang are carved on the rocks. Looking down from the mountain, you can see the secluded Chan rooms of the White Pagoda Temple. But looking up again, you see the majestic appearance of the Dingguang Pagoda.</p>
<p>An old monk stands at the pagoda gate, asking tourists for a few copper coins to enter the pagoda. Entering the pagoda is extremely dark. Following the winding staircase upwards, from the first floor to the seventh, there are compassionate Buddhist images painted on the walls and inscriptions written by famous people. However, trivial words like "On X month X day, I came for a visit with my wife" are also mixed in. Even worse are twisted poems like "High mountains have good water, flatlands have good flowers." Such a beautiful scenic spot has been defiled by vulgar visitors. But the majestic appearance of the White Pagoda still stands proudly in the muddy waters of the city.</p>
<p>The outer edge of the pagoda has stone railings on each floor for people to lean on and enjoy the view. From there, you can overlook the scenery of the entire city. Nuns in the foreign church are walking with their heads bowed, and girls playing ball make light laughter.</p>
<p>The handrail of the White Pagoda spirals upwards from three sides, reaching the top, and can be said to be the epitome of science. But those who speak only mention the skyscrapers of Russia or the high-rise buildings of America. The greatness of our own country's architecture is always ignored. How much does this cause people to lament and complain?</p>

<h3>Toys</h3>
<p>— Mizi Zhang</p>
<p>This year is Children's Year. Because I remember this, I often look at the toys made for children.</p>
<p>In the foreign goods stores next to the road, sporadic small items are hung up, with labels indicating that they are shipped from France, but I have seen the same goods in Japanese toy stores, only the price is cheaper. On shoulder poles and in small stalls, rubber bubbles that gradually inflate as you blow into them are sold, stamped with the words "Completely Domestically Made," indicating that they are manufactured in China. However, Japanese children also play with rubber bubbles with the same stamp, which should be made by them.</p>
<p>Large companies have weapon toys: command swords, machine guns, tanks... However, even children from wealthy families rarely play with them. In the park, foreign children gather sand into round piles, and insert two short tree trunks horizontally. This is clearly creating armored gun vehicles. Chinese children, on the other hand, have pale and thin faces, hiding behind adults, shyly and surprisedly watching, wearing extremely refined long gowns.</p>
<p>In China, there are many toys for adults: concubines, opium pipes, mahjong tiles, light rain, scientific spiritualism, Vajra Dharma assemblies, and more, keeping everyone busy. There is no time to think about children. Even though it is Children's Year, and even though we experienced the ravages of war the year before last, there hasn't been a memorial keepsake created for children. Everything is still copied as before. Then next year it won't be Children's Year, and the situation is easy to imagine.</p>
<p>However, people from Jiangbei are geniuses at making toys. They use two bamboo tubes of different lengths, dyed red and green, connected in a row. Inside the tube is a spring, and there is a handle on the side. When you shake it, it makes a rattling sound. This is a machine gun! It is also the only creation I have seen. I bought one on the edge of the concession, and walked down the road shaking it with my child. Civilized Westerners and victorious Japanese people mostly give us a contemptuous or pitying bitter smile.</p>
<p>However, we walk down the road shaking it without shame, because this is a creation. Since the year before last, many people have scolded the people of Jiangbei, as if this is not enough to show their nobility. Now they are silent, and that nobility is also vague and boundless. But the people of Jiangbei have created crude machine gun toys, using their strong confidence and simple talent to compete with civilized toys. I think they are more worthy of praise than those who buy the latest weapons from abroad, although perhaps some will give me a contemptuous or pitying sneer because of this.</p>
<h3>Beishan and Temple Fair</h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>丨Miscellaneous Writings from Jilin, Two丨</p>
<p>Speaking of Beishan, it can be said that it is the most beautiful place in Jilin. The mountain is not big, nor too high, lying on the northwest corner outside the city. The mountain has tall trees that shade the sun, scattered and mixed low forests, and green lawns like carpets, while also contrasting with red and yellow sandy roads and rows of rocks. There are also carved palaces and platforms by craftsmen, but there is no shortage of thatched huts and grass huts built at will by rural elders. Behind the mountain slope, there are several tilted pagoda tops, closely adjacent to the westernized water pool, as if deliberately declaring themselves as representatives of Eastern and Western cultures. The sandy road, winding and winding, disappears from the foot of the mountain into the mountain. Large and small tea sheds and book stalls are lined up along the road. There are also several sheep intestines trails. During the summer and autumn plum festivals, when the sun sets and dusk falls, people generally want to spit out the stuffiness in the city and cultivate their spirits, they always come to Beishan to play. On the mountain, listening to the bells of the temple, enjoying the cool breeze of the evening, and looking out over the Songhua River, gradually rising and thickening, and the red glow reflected in the western half of the sky, is a kind of lighthearted feeling.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, a large open space is spread out, and next to the open space is a clear pool of water, dotted with clumps of green cattails and aquatic plants. A stone bridge climbs over the water, which is the main road between the city and the mountain. Willow trees are everywhere, always liking to wrinkle the water with the wind. The Ji-Hai Railway meanders from the northeast to the southwest along the water's edge, close to the mountain roots. Therefore, this beautiful landscape of mountains, rivers, and plains is often sprinkled with clusters of coal smoke from locomotives.</p>
<p>Every year, Beishan has a temple fair, and everyone in the province knows the grandness of the temple fair. The temple fair day is the twenty-eighth day of the fourth lunar month, which is the "main day", plus the twenty-seventh and twenty-ninth two "auxiliary days", there are three days in total.</p>
<p>A few days before each temple fair, the railway bureau has to add trains, and the ticket prices are discounted, what a rare opportunity! Farmers from outside the township, in order to bargain, in order to go to the provincial capital to visit the scenery, and some people in order to burn incense and fulfill their vows in the temple, at this time, would rather sacrifice a few days of work in the fields, and are willing to take this opportunity to play for a few days.</p>
<p>Speaking of the temple fair itself, it is actually a move that wastes money and time. In addition to some temporary markets being added at that time, and some large and small stores taking the opportunity to do business, the only other thing is burning incense. All the people who visit the mountain and attend the fair will spend some money.</p>
<p>Although the temple fair is once a year, in 1932, the provincial administrative authorities exceptionally ordered it to be stopped, because the area was not peaceful, and the volunteer army lurking around Jilin City could attack the provincial capital at any time, and the temple fair suffered an unfortunate fate as a result. To be honest, at that time, people really didn't have the mood to visit temples and attend fairs: those living in the city were panic-stricken, and the villagers were also living a life of "not knowing whether they would live or die tomorrow," which can be said to be a gift given by the great turmoil.</p>
<p>But the situation in 1933 was different. Because the Japanese troops had somewhat suppressed the volunteer army. So, this year's temple fair was specially promoted and held, becoming a tool for the "Cooperation Society" to promote "Royal Wayism". Using the temple fair to carry out political propaganda is probably the first time since there has been a temple fair in Beishan.</p>
<p>The so-called propaganda by the temple fair is so simple that it makes people laugh when they hear it. It only relies on Japanese planes to scatter some leaflets and slogans in the sky over the mountain and the ground below. Here is a leaflet with the fewest words:</p>
<p>"The Gift of the New Country"</p>
<p>"Golden spears are sure to bring a peaceful spring"</p>
<p>"New country rain and dew benefit the people"</p>
<p>"Look! Hundreds of industries rise like a forest"</p>
<p>"Live a life of brocade clothes and jade food, saying goodbye to poverty"</p>
<p>This is intentionally burying the facts and deliberately deceiving the people. In fact, there is still no place in the Northeast that can be called peaceful. Perhaps Zheng Xiaoxu, Xi Qia and others have obtained brocade clothes and jade food, but most ordinary people have lost their homes and jobs, and are still suffering from a lack of rice and clothing. How dare they talk about jade food and brocade clothes!</p>
<p>The twenty-eighth day of the fourth lunar month in 1934 has passed, but I don't know if this year's temple fair will be held? If it is held, will there be any new tricks? I think it won't stop, because they can take this opportunity to promote Royal Wayism again.</p>
<h3>June Night</h3>
<p>— Hugo, translated by Mu Mutian</p>
<p>In summer, at the hour when the days are done,</p>
<p>The plain is full of flowers, a perfumed wind;</p>
<p>The eye is shut, the ear is half awake,</p>
<p>And sleep suspends in a half-dreamed behind.</p>
<p>The stars are purer, the shadows seem more bland;</p>
<p>A gentle twilight streaks the steep dome blue;</p>
<p>And the pale dawn, still lingering in the land,</p>
<p>Looks through the heavens all the long night through.</p>
<h3>The Third Nana</h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>Turning Nana into the Camille is not a very clumsy technique. Nana is indeed evolved from the Camille. It is not impossible to call Nana the second Marguerite, or to call Marguerite the first Nana. They are both women who have been trampled upon. Marguerite does not understand the men who trample on her any less than Nana does. But Marguerite still dreams of pure love丨丨 In fact, Nana also has some of this丨丨 sublime sacrifice, so she suffered double trampling. No matter how respectful and loving she is to Mr. Grand Lieu until death, the trampling she receives from people like Grand Lieu is no less than that from people she hates.</p>
<p>Nana no longer believes in the sanctity of noble people. Although she also gets the love of pure youth, she is only afraid that this is a sin, and does not feel that this can lead to an ideal. She escapes from this trampling, and also has a more courageous way to deal with another kind of trampling. She is trampled by men, but at the same time she also tramples on men. The ravages of the flesh and money are only details. Her great success is to make people know that in addition to the so-called soulless women, there are also equally soulless men.</p>
<p>I dare not say what Zola meant by calling Nana a poisonous fungus. Of course, I don’t even know if he was thinking about whether to put it out, and how to put it out. Although most writers are prophets, Zola is still far from another kind of society after all. We are not much different from the early nineteenth century. Most people still want to re-entangle Nana in Marguerite's dream, so that Nana will be saved, and society will be saved. The Nana in the movie was produced under this psychology.</p>
<p>However, in today's society, there are also women like Duncan. People who ignore Duncan's art probably won't think of Duncan as much higher than Nana. The men in Duncan's life are actually not as cute as Duncan wrote. Gordon Craig wanting her to sharpen pencils for him at home is not an unusual man. As for that rich man, Rohon Lee, in any case, he is always an uncomfortable character. Perhaps Duncan is too great, perhaps she is too weak, she has never controlled men like Nana.</p>
<p>But in today's society, only Nana can avoid suffering too much. In a society where there are still many men who trample on women, there will eventually be just as many women who trample on men. This woman will not be a simple Nana, but will be a Nana with Duncan's ideals, the third Nana, and she may not still be a poisonous fungus.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Reading "A Hundred Schools of Novels of the Huangming Dynasty" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(IX) In "Eryou Weitan," there is another story that is also very good, and it is also recorded here. The text says: "My nature is not tolerant of wearing a hat and belt, especially in the hot months. Yuzhang likes to be hot early, and this year is even worse. On the seventeenth day of the third spring month, I entertained guests at the Tengwang Pavilion. The sun came out like fire, and sweat followed in succession. My head was sweating so much that I almost didn't know how to go home, and I shouted madly. My wife prepared a bath for me, so I went to it with my head bare and my body naked. At that time, the West Mountain was full of clouds and fog, and the new tea had just arrived, which Zhang Youbo happened to leave as a gift. The tea color was white and large, with a bean fragrance, almost comparable to Tiger Hill. I was bathing out at that time, sitting naked under the bright moon, and hurriedly ordered the servant girl to fetch new water to cook and taste it. I felt the water entering my throat, and a wind blew through both armpits. I thought that this realm was not found in the officialdom. Mr. Linquan Cai was old and addicted to tea, even more than I was. At that time, he had already gone to bed, and it was impossible to call him to drink it together. I cooked it again in the morning and left it for him, but it was already a second meaning. Recalling the taste of last night, I wrote a letter to give to Sheng Sheng." What is called "clear, elegant and enduring," this article can be said to have it.</p>
<p>(X) In Hu Yinglin's "Remaining Words of Jia Yi," there are also several readable stories, such as "Wang Taipu" and other articles. In terms of expressing emotions, there is only "Li Weiyin." He said: "Li Weiyin Taibao only changed the cold and heat once or twice, and then he was not good at walking. He staggered out of the guest room, the road was very diligent, to the point that tears fell and he couldn't stop. Because he remembered when he ran horses in Changgan and jumped over streams in Zhongling, how agile he was? And once he was weakened, he knew how much life's prosperity could be relied on. I couldn't help but look in the mirror and sigh for the silk. "There are many short lyrical articles of this kind in books such as "Baoyan Tang Secret Collection," but there are not many in "A Hundred Schools of Novels," which is thought to have been deleted by the editor.</p>
<p>The above is a postscript to ten anecdotes, miscellaneous notes when reading "A Hundred Schools of Novels of the Huangming Dynasty." When I finished reading it, Lingfeng used the raw draft of "Long Live" and took the cold, sarcastic and satirical parts to make an article "Jokes of the Ming Dynasty" for him. Recently, after rereading the entire book, I still cannot stop writing, so I made this article again. Among the hundred schools of novels, the systematic and excellent ones that I like to read are Gu Yuanqing's "Yunlin Yishi," which writes about the life of Ni Yunlin, Zhang Hongpan's "Xizhou Hepu," which recalls the past events of deceased friends, Fei Yuanlu's "Xiaocai Qingke," which writes about local scenery and life, and Lu Can's "Dongxiao Ji," which records ghosts and romantic encounters, but the length is longer, so only included in the personal secrets. As for matters involving literary nets and banned books, they should be recorded separately.</p>
<h3>Fire Disaster (8)</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>That afternoon, I obtained some travel expenses from my uncle, Mr. Zhang, and friends. Against my will, I boarded a crowded car and returned to Medan. At that time, I only had the clothes on my back, and everything else was buried in the fire. Alas, it is so heartbreaking that those precious documents and photos that I had collected with so much effort, time, and money were completely lost!</p>
<p>In Medan, I composed my disillusioned heart and tired body. I purchased new travel necessities and borrowed some money from friends before returning to my country in disappointment. After returning home, I reported the detailed circumstances to the principal of a certain school and the editor of a bookstore. Besides expressing their condolences, they also comforted me with a few words.</p>
<p>A month after returning home, I received a letter from Mr. Zhang, postmarked from Singapore: "In the disaster of January 10th, you unfortunately suffered the same calamity. How unfortunate is your fate! Thinking of the fierceness of the wind and the intensity of the fire that night, I still feel palpitations! My father's fifty years of arduous efforts and foundation were destroyed in one day. How painful! Fortunately, Mr. Xu Youwen, the owner of Guanglong Company, is my father's sworn brother. Although he is not very familiar with the ways of the world and is lightly lectured, he is still trying every possible means to rebuild the business in the future, and will certainly not be harmed by others' schemes. However, since the foundation has been ruined, it is now completely different from the past. I heard that although the fire originated in our store, the source of the fire actually belongs to your uncle... There is quite a bit of gossip among the overseas Chinese community, and the resident government is also sending out detectives to investigate, fearing that the truth will come to light soon."</p>
<p>Although this letter caused some anxiety in my heart for a while, I gradually forgot about it because of the struggle for life. Suddenly, eight months later, I received another letter from my uncle from his original home in Guangdong, with a remittance enclosed. The letter said: "At the beginning of the year, my nephew went south and stayed in my store for only one day. How unfortunate that his fate was so difficult that he shared the disaster of the fire god. I deeply sigh for my nephew! Afterwards, I was subjected to slander and accusations, and many people in the port placed the blame for the fire on me. What is even worse is that Guanglong Company in Singapore, because Fuhua Company in this port owed them a lot of money and they could not recover it, did not consider that the fire originated from Fuhua and actually instigated a young man with the surname Zhang to collude with ignorant people in the overseas Chinese community to accuse me of deliberately setting the fire because of business failure, in order to alleviate the economic crisis and attempt to receive insurance money. My nephew, how can I, who has lived an honest life, endure this unjust grievance? Therefore, I hired a lawyer to write a defense. At this time, the insurance company also sent detectives to investigate and spy on various parties. Fortunately, a few enlightened and fair people in the port helped me, proving that my accounts were clear and that my assets exceeded my debts, so there was no need for such a base and vicious plan. The Kapitan (Note 14) is the leader of our overseas Chinese and has a duty to speak out. He is an enlightened person, so he strongly defended my innocence. Thus, the half-year-long unjust case was finally cleared, and I have now received the insurance money. After using eighty thousand to repay debts and ten thousand for litigation costs, there is still ten thousand shields of silver left. Thinking that I have spent my life in a foreign country and endured many hardships, I am now old and should retire to my hometown, relying on a small piece of land to end my days. I heard that your suitcase contained many documents and images, which could not be rescued at that time, which is regrettable! I am now sending a remittance of one thousand yuan, hoping you can collect it from the Maritime Bank to compensate for your loss. Then the previous matter is only worth a smile, and you can avoid any loss!"</p>
<p>This letter made me feel dejected for several days! The one thousand yuan could temporarily alleviate my urgent needs, but how could the effort or time spent on those precious documents and photos be compensated by one thousand yuan? Moreover, fortunately, I was able to recover some of my losses, but what about those propertyless shop employees and workers who depended on that place for a living; or those overseas Chinese who had a little property but lost their settlement and the basis of their lives inherited from their ancestors? What other way could they continue to live besides suffering an unjust disaster?</p>
<p>(Note 14) In addition to using tribal chiefs to help them manage the indigenous people, the colonial government also set up several official titles such as "Ma Yao" and "Kapitan" in the Chinese community to help them manage the Chinese. The authority of the Kapitan is not very clear in law; naturally, they have no power in politics, but they are very useful in managing the tax collection and disputes of the overseas Chinese. (The End)</p>
<h3>Regarding "Leaving the Coastline of Malaya"</h3>
<p>After this publication released the new poem "Leaving the Coastline of Malaya" on the second, Mr. Liu Bing came to the office on the third and personally handed over a letter, which roughly stated "...... That poem was written by me, and it was published in the fifth issue of "New Poetry" edited by the Chinese Poetry Society in January of this year. (Now I am sending the publication for your review.) I did not expect that now, someone would "rob in broad daylight," adding and subtracting a few words from my work, changing it to Mr. "Qiutao's" own name, and daring to submit it to the Free Talk section for tens of thousands of viewers to publish (excerpt omitted). Now, because of my editorial responsibility, I am afraid of causing misunderstandings from all parties, so I have to notify Mr. and ask Mr. to publish this letter in the Free Talk section."</p>
<p>While the editor was trying to investigate the truth of the matter, someone had already publicly exposed it in another newspaper. Therefore, I have no choice but to publish Mr. Liu Bing's letter as follows. According to the custom of this newspaper, the manuscript fee is cancelled.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: The Swap is About to Expire, the Gold Market is Stable, the Silver Price and Exchange Rate are Shrinking, and the Result is Still a Rise of One Yuan and Two.</h3>
<p>The gold market showed a stable appearance yesterday. The market situation was mediocre in the morning, fluctuating uncertainly. There were more buyers in the market, so the result was a continued rise compared to the previous day. This is also a phenomenon that should exist before the swap. In the early morning, the overseas silver market in London shrank and the United States was flat. The forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange fell from one hao to four hao. The exchange rate shrank, and the price of raw gold in London fell by two pence. US cotton rose by fourteen pounds and the US wheat rose by six two five. Stocks also rose by nine jiao and six fen. People's hearts were still stable due to the influence of the silver price shrinking. The over-the-counter trading opened slightly higher, then broke through the 20 yuan mark, and finally retreated into the 20 yuan range due to the ample supply at high prices. After opening, the bank sold some, and the selling pressure in the market was stronger, coupled with the short-selling pressure from retail investors, but the HSBC listed price was flat in both England and the United States, which was still stable. Foreign telegrams said that there was news that they were opposed to using silver to repay the war debts that were due. The bank also bought on the cheap, and it was still able to recover. Later, the bank's appetite was uncertain, the domestic market was stable, and the market situation also showed fluctuations. When the Seattle night silver price reported that the rise was 125, 125, 125, it once fell, and the bank's appetite was still good, and the central bank continued to settle shillings, and the buyers were still excited and rose, but did not cross the 20 yuan mark. The momentum was peaceful at noon. There was no special change in the morning, and the opinions of the industry were different. The exchange of drafts was also mutually beneficial. The market situation was moderate and the transaction was flat. The price of red gold was 1,029 yuan and 7 jiao. After recording the market situation in the morning,</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1,019 yuan and 7 jiao, which was 2 yuan higher than the previous closing price. The opening price of goods was 9 yuan and 3 jiao. The exchange market opened in the morning with a recent purchase price of 1 shilling, 3 pence, 625 for the British exchange, and 32 yuan and 875 for the US exchange. Mitsui sold 33 yuan and 125 for August and 1875 for September. Huabi sold 25 for September. Hengyu Yuqing Yongtong Taichang and others sold, and fell from 9 yuan and 8 jiao to 7 yuan and 3 jiao. It was learned that HSBC's listed prices for England and the United States were flat. Zhentai Dadecheng Hengyu Yuqing Yong and others advanced, rising to 8 yuan and 8 jiao. The bank still sold, and Yingfeng Heng Tong Taichang Yuqing Yong sold to 7 yuan and 5 jiao again. Yuanmao Yongding Kangfu Yu Chang Sheng Yong bought. Citibank bought 25 US dollars in September and 375 in October, and rose to 9 yuan and 8 jiao. Yuqing Yong sold, and retreated to 8 yuan and 5 jiao. Dadecheng advanced, rising to 9 yuan and 3 jiao. At this time, it hovered around 9 yuan. When the Seattle night silver price reported that the rise was 125, Hengyu Huixiang and others supplied, and fell to 7 yuan and 7 jiao. Yuan Yi Fu Yu Hengyu Yuqing Yong and others all had a good appetite, and gradually rose. McGalli bought 3125 US dollars in October, and rose to 9 yuan and 9 jiao. There were many sellers at the 20 yuan limit, and it was difficult to rise again. Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong Yuqing Yong Yuan Yi and others sold off one after another, falling to 8 yuan and 8 jiao. The noon closing price was 1,018 yuan and 9 jiao, and the goods were sold at 8 yuan and 8 jiao. After the market closed, although Yuan Yi sold, Fuxing Yong and others still bought, and it was quite stable. The highest price in the morning was 1,019 yuan and 9 jiao, and the lowest price was 1,017 yuan and 3 jiao, with a fluctuation of 2 yuan and 6 jiao. The result was a rise of 1 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the previous closing price.</p>
<p>The closing price was 33 yuan and 625 for the US exchange listed by HSBC Bank, and the combined standard gold price was 1,060 yuan, 0 jiao and 53 fen. According to the closing price, the discount was about 41 yuan, which was 1 yuan less than the previous closing price. The registered price for July was 1,019 yuan, and the water replenishment in the morning was 1,019 yuan. The price of red gold was 1,029 yuan and 7 jiao, which was about 10 yuan more expensive. The market was flat and tired. As the swap approached, each spot number knew its appetite, and those with more spot goods must short the futures, and there was a risk of a swap. Therefore, Tianjin goods were only 10 yuan and 0 jiao more expensive, and there was a lack of transactions. The Central Bank remained silent.</p>
<p>Buyers were crowded in the market. In summary, Wanxing Yifeng Yongheng Tai Yuanmao Yongchang Shengyong Hongxing Fu'an Yuanchun Dachang Xianghong Kang Yong Fu Tai Heng Xiang He Yongde Fuxing Yong Shunli and others were on the buy side. Tong Taichang Yongfeng Hengyu Yi Yu Yicheng Huixiang Tongchun Yuan Dadecheng and others were on the sell side. Yuqing Yong Hengyu first came out and then came in.

Guang bang Shengda still rarely entered, Hengxing was silent. The total number of transactions on the day was 19,439.</p>

After opening, the bank's supply trend was slightly looser, but because HSBC Bank's listed price was announced, the prices of British and American exchanges were flat, and the bank took the opportunity to buy and settle, the process was still flat. Later, the appetites of Chinese merchants and banks were different, and the market situation became fluctuating and lacked special changes. There were uncertain reports about the denial of using silver to pay for war debts and the night market silver price rising by 125. The situation was still good at noon. The closing selling price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 625 for the recent British exchange, and 32 yuan and 875 for the US exchange, which was 0625 tighter than the previous closing price.

<h3>The Foreign Money Market Still Opens at 8%, the Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars is Flat.</h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the lunar calendar, the habits of society are difficult to change. Therefore, once the festival arrives, the general expenses remain the same. The silver and money industry often shows a state of tension at this time. In recent years, due to the impact of the recession, the purchasing power of all sectors is weak. After the silver and money business slightly improved the day before yesterday, it was like a flash in the pan. By yesterday, it was felt that it had regressed. The price of adding water has fallen by one point compared to the previous day, with a price of three points. The foreign money market has not risen or fallen. Both the morning and noon markets were at 8 points. The transaction of clearing notes in the morning market and the new transaction was more than 4.4 million, the transaction in the noon market was more than 500,000, the transaction in the small general meeting was more than 300,000, the foreign mortgage transaction was more than 700,000, and the new transaction was more than 1.2 million. The bank's receipt of solutions was far less than the previous day. It is estimated that foreign banks received more than 2 million in bills, more than 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, and more than 4.3 million in various goods, exchange pledges, and miscellaneous solutions. 600,000 were released from the warehouse. Chinese banks received more than 3.1 million in bills, more than 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 700,000 in customs duties, and more than 3.9 million in various goods, exchange pledges, and miscellaneous solutions. 300,000 were released from the warehouse. Japanese banks received more than 1.5 million in bills, and more than 4.2 million in various goods, exchange pledges, and miscellaneous solutions. 400,000 were put into the warehouse. The money shops received more than 36 million in foreign public bills, more than 4.8 million in foreign exchange, and more than 800,000 in banknotes were returned.

Also, the total number of exchanges by the local bill exchange on the 13th was 6,962,840 yuan and 02 jiao 7 fen, including 3,768,300 yuan and 004 jiao 9 fen in silver dollars, and 3,194,539 yuan and 7 jiao 8 fen in exchange transfers of silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Corners Arrive and the Price Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan's small foreign exchange did not return because it had arrived in small quantities. The morning market price was 820 yuan, and the noon market price was 818 yuan, which was the same as the previous day. The transaction was 4,500 yuan in the morning market and 2,000 yuan in the noon market. The stock of Guangdong's small foreign exchange was already sufficient, and yesterday another 100,000 yuan arrived, which led to a sharp drop in the market price. The opening price in the morning market was 733 yuan and 5 jiao, which was 2 yuan and 7 jiao lower than the previous day. The closing price in the noon market continued to fall by 3 yuan and 5 jiao, to 730 yuan. The result was a drop of more than 6 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the previous day. The transaction was 50,000 yuan in the morning market and 55,000 yuan in the noon market. The copper yuan increased by 500 yuan compared to the previous day, to 331,000 yuan. The transaction price was 13,100 yuan, equivalent to 43,361 strings of money.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt Rose Sharply in Late Trading, All Rose by 45 Jiao to More than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese Securities Exchange, the market moved very violently and suddenly. At first, the news about the Bank of Japan was dull, and its environment and atmosphere seemed to be gradually deteriorating, and the rumors did not stop. People's hearts were weak and the market price was chaotic and tired. At the close of the market, it was suddenly reported that the Bank of Japan had been found in Beijing. The news came suddenly, and the market price changed very quickly. The shorts failed again, and the market situation was turbulent. The market price had fallen slightly due to the disappearance of the Bank of Japan last time. The shorts were very enthusiastic, so its reaction must be greater than before, and the future will see new highs again. The opening yesterday was due to the sale of No. 6, 38, and 48, etc., and only No. 4 and No. 11 were mostly on the buying side. The market price fell by one jiao to four and a half jiao uniformly, and the trend was quite tired. The short-selling party slightly pulled up in the second round, and slightly recovered by five fen and one jiao. The whole six were good for three jiao. The news was still dull after the opening in the afternoon, and the disarmament fell by another three jiao, and the rest were tired and unable to rise. When the market closed, it was suddenly reported that the Bank of Japan had been found, and people were still confused, but the market price rose sharply. Most of them rose sharply by seven or eight jiao to more than one yuan. As a result, the market price rose by four or five jiao to more than one yuan uniformly. Only the current month was 19 off, only five fen was good. The total number of transactions was about 20 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Lively Rise</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York Stock Exchange market rose lively yesterday (12th) due to the strong performance of miscellaneous grains. Corn was particularly strong, rising by more than three points. According to news, the fields have been suffering from drought for a long time, and recently there have been rampant pests, resulting in heavy losses. Agricultural tool stocks and mail-order store stocks were boosted, and soon the rising trend spread to the entire market. The small exchange rose due to the good demand for gasoline stocks. Bonds also rose with stocks. The (securities) buying sentiment was strong, with the demand for department stores, metals, and railway stocks being the most active. The (wheat) public shifted their attention to corn, and the overall situation did not change. The rain seemed to have ended, and the condition of the crops in the fields was still poor, so it was appropriate to buy when it fell. (Cotton) The main reason for the market's rise was the news of bad weather. At the same time, the active export sales and the disappearance of supply at the beginning of the morning were also helpful to the popularity. The cotton exchange estimates that the domestic consumption in the United States in May totaled 535,000 bales. (Rubber) The market rose due to large purchases by the industry in this place (New York) and London. The market was extremely strong, and the total transaction was 950,000 shares throughout the day. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: US Cotton Strengthens, Standard Yarn Rises</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm due to the rising trend of foreign cotton, and people's hearts are rising. However, the sales of current yarn are becoming increasingly quiet, so the market situation is not very good. However, the buyers are optimistic and expect that the business of the customer gangs will improve after the festival, and the number of factories reducing and stopping work is increasing, so the selling pressure is suppressed.</p>
<h3>Forward Yarn Rises Back One Yuan</h3>
<p>The opening price of the standard yarn in the previous market was because the US cotton rose again, there was a lack of sellers, and the trading floor was tighter. At the same time, retail shorts covered their positions, and each month rose from seven jiao to one yuan and one jiao. It was heard in the afternoon that there were not many spot yarn transactions, and the market atmosphere was slightly looser, and each month fell by one, two, three, four, and seven jiao. The total transaction statistics for the day were 23,150 bales. It was found that Da Ji sold 1,600 bales, Yuan Da 700 bales, Yu Kang 600 bales, Ming Hua 850 bales, Chang Feng 750 bales, Geng Feng 500 bales, Yuan De 500 bales, Yuan Da bought 500 bales, Heng Yi 500 bales, Da Fu 1,550 bales, Tong Fu 800 bales, Tong Ji 1,150 bales, Da Ji 650 bales, and Chang Yu 650 bales, Xin Cheng 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>

<p>November 184.0 183.3 183.8 1.00 33,700</p>
<p>Total 306,450</p>
<h3>Spot Sales 547 Bales</h3>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that a total of 547 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day. The market situation is similar to the previous day. The actual amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Wuhu 5 Guangdong 37 Sichuan 400</p>
<p>Inland 80 Peers 25</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm again due to the rise of US cotton and retail shorts slightly covering their positions. However, the long companies continued to close their positions when the price rose, so the market atmosphere was not as strong as the previous day. The amount of money that the Han gang took out was quite large. According to the investigation, the Cotton Inspection Office has delivered more than 34,000 dan of goods.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Returns to Fourth Corner</h3>
<p>Before the flower season market opened, it rose following foreign cotton. Buying was more vigorous, with each month rising four to five corners. In the afternoon, the bulls closed out positions. However, the Ningbo group entered again, and bull companies slightly closed out. The current month fell one corner, and the far month fell five points. The total daily turnover was 70,700 dan. The source of sales was Yuan Da with 15,500 dan, Yu Kang with 1,200 dan, Da Feng with 1,700 dan, Jun Chang with 1 dan each, Yi Chang with 1,000 dan, Chang Feng with 6,000 dan, and Rui Yuan with 1,200 dan.

<p>Total 808,400</p>
<h3>Reduced Work Affects Cotton Sales</h3>
<p>The current cotton sales are still sluggish. Many factories are reducing work. The source includes Yao flowers with 540 bales and Tong flowers with 240 bales. The current flower prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 42.25 Yong An Factory enters 400 bales and sends the goods to the factory now.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rises Fifteen Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to poor news from Liverpool. Later, it strengthened due to unfavorable weather and buying by the industry. As a result, spot prices rose fifteen points, and futures prices rose fourteen to fifteen points. British cotton futures fell one to two points. Indian cotton was soft due to bull closing and selling by futures traders. As a result, Pingguoer fell four rupees two and a half, and Aomula and Bai Luo Xi both fell four and a half rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated the 12th).</p>

<h3>Tianjin Cotton is Still Firm</h3>
<p>Tianjin News: The market for Xihe flowers is still firm. However, due to the sharp rise, transactions have decreased, and factories are sluggish. Lower quality goods continue to be made. Yesterday, foreign merchants bought 100 bales, with an opening price of 35 yuan, and another 200 bales, with prices ranging from 38.50 yuan to 37 yuan. Also, yarn is stable, and transactions are not smooth.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Totaling more than six thousand pieces</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton arrived yesterday. The British ship "Sutun" (transliteration) entered the port at 5:00 AM, carrying more than 1,900 pieces of cotton. In addition, the "Kaitepu" (transliteration), which entered the port at 1:00 PM, carried 1,100 tons of cotton, approximately 4,400 pieces, all transported from Mumbai, British India.</p>
<h3>Food: Standard Flour Turns Stable in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, each month showed signs of initial weakness followed by stability. The quoted price of foreign wheat was about one or two corners better in Chicago and about four points better in Canada. After the opening price, the general public observed that although foreign wheat seemed to be doing well, the degree of rise was weak and insufficient to carry weight. Coupled with the reversal of the previous day, people's hearts had also weakened. Therefore, the opening price was unstable. The near-term fell slightly by one or two points, while the far-term remained fixed. Later, because the Jiangsu and Zhejiang groups slightly bought, the market rebounded. The far-term remained flat. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, buying interest from outside the industry had slightly increased, and the market became stable. Later, factories sold off, and it returned to stability. As for the standard for this month, because Fufeng has already been drawing, the Tianjin group feels quite convenient. As for the various months in the far-term, they can currently be held. However, given this year's abundant wheat harvest and the inability to increase actual sales, the accumulation of wheat and the lack of outlets for flour in the future, the market may inevitably change. As a result, this month was down five li, July was unchanged, August was up two and a half li, September and October were up half a point, and November was up seven and a half li.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Price High, Futures Return Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, each month showed signs of first falling and then stabilizing. The quoted price of foreign wheat was better, although by varying amounts from four points to one or two corners. However, due to the weakening of the flour market, people's hearts had also become unstable. Although the opening price was down by varying amounts, small by one or two points, the market price of new wheat in the Suxi area was quite high, and the industry there had a bullish mindset. Therefore, the standard product saw buying, and the opening price turned higher, two or three points better than the initial opening. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market for each month had turned to hovering. Because the Northern Jiangsu group was still thinking of selling at a high price, people's hearts softened again. As a result, July and August were up one point, September was up three points, and October was down one point. As for the source of new wheat, it is now gradually becoming more vigorous. Yesterday, four to five thousand bales of Northern Jiangsu wheat arrived, with high and clean samples and adequate quality. The opening price for boat wheat was 2.65 yuan, and for Nanjing wheat, it was 2.8 yuan, with more than a thousand bales opened.</p>
<h3>Xian Rice Sales Still Slow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the guest Xian rice market was that arrivals were scarce due to the approaching festival. Arrivals from various wheeled routes were less than 2,000 bales, but sales were also slow. The Zhejiang and inland groups will have to wait until after the festival to handle it, and the local market has no interest. Although Fujian province has continued to handle it, it is only perfunctory. Yesterday, the Fujian appetite was particularly weak, with only 750 bales sold throughout the city. However, local rural villages were inquiring, handling more than 1,000 bales, but the total was still less than 2,000 bales. The market was originally expected to be lower, but because both arrivals and sales were low, cargo owners were not very eager to sell, so market prices have stabilized.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Continues to Rise Five Points</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source from various groups is nearly 30 companies (4,500 to 600 stones). Late rice and thick japonica rice each account for half of the varieties. Sales of late rice are more active than thick japonica rice. The opening procedure showed vitality. The Northern Ocean, Tianjin, and Weihaiwei groups are competing with each other, and their interest is quite strong, moving forward all the way without any sign of slowing down. The closing price was that the groups successively bought Qing Jiao, Song Si, and other goods in 14 to 15 loads, approximately 2,000 bales. However, because the festival is near at hand, sellers are in a modest position, and the price has only continued to rise by five points. As for thick japonica rice, although the group also moved, the number was ultimately limited, only two to three hundred bales, and the local store appetite was flat, so it remained in a stable situation. Therefore, the prices of the Chang, Su, Tong, and Nangang groups all saw little change. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan have seen no great glory or disgrace to this point.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 companies arrived from various routes in Hexia. Various white japonica rice, high-quality, and flat materials were sluggish on the market. Medium and lower grades continued to trade. White Yuan rice continued to sell cleverly. Thin rice had a rather active appetite. Yang Du Jian rice, without picking high-quality, was considered not bad. The medium and lower grades were sluggish. The port customer tip also expressed sympathy. The market situation was that high-quality white japonica rice was slightly on track, medium and lower grades were fixed, White Yuan rice was weak by several points, Yang Du and port customer tips were high and firm, medium and lower grades were slightly weak, and the customer tip showed a flat and fair trend.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Sugar Continues to Open Two Hundred More Packages</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, because the customs gold returned slightly, the public association's atmosphere was idle. The drawn plate was like No. 4 coarse sand white at 20 yuan 0.65, No. 9 He Chi at 15 yuan 8, No. 8 KNG Mark at 156 yuan, Taikoo Sugar B Mark still at 20 yuan 0.8, DY Mark at 20 yuan 0.2, HX Mark at 19 yuan 9, No. 1 local factory white at 19 yuan 1, and Yuan Xing Factory No. 1 white goods were slightly inferior at 18 yuan 7. Each of the above grades had sporadic transactions. Domestically produced Hainan red sugar continued to open two hundred more packages, with the price still at 12 yuan 8. Ordinary branch red sugar opened more than a hundred packages, with prices ranging from 13 yuan 8 to 13 yuan 6.5. Because the firms on both sides held on, Chao Qing did not trade.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt After the Rise Ceases</h3>
<p>Asphalt has been ordered to be discontinued. In previous years, it still had outlets in soap factories, but this summer it has been taken over by coconut oil and butter. It is like the sheep announcing the new moon. The rise in the Hankou market half a month ago was stimulated by purchases from Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Ningbo. Since spring and summer, the market has been getting worse and worse, almost without any stop. Fortunately, this pillar was able to stabilize it, so in the past two weeks it has seemed slightly more vigorous. The heavy Jing in the Hankou market is around 15 yuan per Zhui, so heavy is 14 yuan 6.7, and Ping Jing is 14 yuan. Macheng oil is also slightly weaker at 14 yuan. However, since prices have risen, buyers have also collected their hands. Therefore, the situation in recent days has felt rather quiet. According to details in the Hankou letter, there are transactions that seem slightly cheaper, but the summer season has arrived, and both candle and tao have stopped production. Soap factories have no use for them, so sales are completely blocked. Local firms do not have very thick inventory, and customer goods continue to arrive. Even if they are handled from Hankou, they do not dare to have many appetites. However, the market has fallen to this point, and there is very little hope of falling further. However, because soap factories do not use it, the inventory in various places is always difficult to use up. It all depends on the use of candles and tao, which is always limited. Measuring by this, even until after autumn, I am afraid there will not be much of a good face.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea Sells Well and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, foreign firms in the coming routes were still very interested in Zhenmei green tea. The Barth firm has started to operate again, and transactions are extremely vigorous. Among them, the market prices of Zhenmei from the Xi Wu Dong and other routes have suddenly risen by four to five yuan. The green tea market has made significant progress. As for black tea from the Qi Ning and other routes, the market has also turned firm due to the surge in demand from the Russian Cooperative Association. The sales of coarse black tea from the Wenzhou local firm and other routes are particularly active. The situation in both the black tea and green tea markets is stable.</p>
<h3>Hardware: British, German, Italian, and French Tinplate Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to overseas telegrams, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, and other countries have united to ship tinplate, and the selling price has also been jointly increased, rising by one-tenth to five-tenths. The overseas tin price has been rising continuously, leading to an even greater rise in tinplate prices. Therefore, a telegram from Danlian estimated 17 shillings and 8 pence per box (with iron list) and 16 shillings and 9 pence (without iron list). Double-linked without iron list opened at 34 shillings, and with iron list at 35 shillings and 2 pence. Although local colleagues have not seen a purchase order, the consolidation of market sentiment is not what it used to be. Therefore, the trend of tinplate has been unusually good in recent days. Therefore, colleagues and factories who generally hold inventory, upon hearing this news,</p>

<h3>Banning Women's Strange and Unusual Clothing</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Indeed, in recent years, women's clothing has become so bizarre and unusual that it is almost indescribable. Sometimes shoulders are fully exposed, and suddenly powdered legs are completely revealed, reaching the height of fashionable modernity. Fashion entrepreneurs and new clothing companies advocate and call for it, and countless young ladies and grandmothers follow and compete, singing in harmony, forming a magnificent spectacle of colorful hues! Since women's clothing has become a fashionable pursuit of "utmost beauty and meticulous study," it is bound to violate the main purpose of "clothing to protect the body" and degenerate into a nauseating phenomenon. The so-called "showing off strangeness and competing in skill not only harms health but also damages public morals" is precisely the case.</p>
<p>Originally, this trend grew as society approached twilight, and people sought carnal pleasure to forget reality. It was by no means caused by moralists lamenting "the decline of public morals and the loss of ancient values." Therefore, its elimination is no longer a local "public morals" matter but has become a social problem closely related to it. We see that although the New Life Movement, which advocates frugality, is sweeping the country, it has not affected the love of beauty in wives and concubines. The fact that strange and unusual clothing is still prevalent is a clear example. However, the current government is also paying attention to the damage to public morals and health caused by strange and unusual clothing and is taking measures to ban it. This is of greater merit than the irregular destruction groups of modernity and is a head-on blow to fashionable women at this moment.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, upon receiving an order from Chairman Chiang, has already formulated measures to ban strange and unusual clothing, ordering the Provincial Public Security Bureau and relevant departments to be informed. The longest cheongsam must be one inch from the back of the foot, the highest collar must be one and a half inches from the jawbone, the shortest sleeve length must be even with the elbow joint, and the slit must not be more than three inches above the knee, etc. It will first be implemented among female civil servants, female students, and family members of civil servants, and then promoted to women from other regions and fields. Women who do not comply with these measures in their clothing will be subject to intervention by patrol officers. If there is resistance, they may be detained and punished. Similarly, such a ban was seen in the Lu Province authorities not long ago. It is said that Guangxi is even more swift and resolute, with female students not only advocating simplicity but also considering it a virtue to become nurses and servants.</p>
<p>Let those aesthetician gentlemen praise women's clothing of "showing off strangeness and competing in skill" as a manifestation of social civilization. If we examine the social implications it represents more carefully, the conclusion cannot but be "when a state is about to perish, there must be monsters." Is it simply that women subjectively want to be fashionable and modern? It is certainly not necessarily so. China is currently a society of national economic bankruptcy, upheaval, and unrest. In the process of this bankruptcy and unrest, it is divided into two extremely disparate classes. The upper class leads a life of indulgence, luxury, and licentiousness. Spending hundreds of foreign dollars on a pair of wedding leather shoes and using several buckets of milk for a bath is not uncommon. As for the countless women who have fallen into the hunger groups, on the one hand, extreme poverty reduces the number of men who can "establish a family and a career," and the female element is excessive. On the other hand, these many women feel the pressure of the economy and are brought to the human flesh market to satisfy the lusts of the general "sex maniacs." The former strives to win the exclusive favor of the "three big and two small," and the latter dresses up the goods to attract customers widely. Thus, every muscle and every appearance is made to the utmost. This is why women's strange and unusual clothing has become popular.</p>
<p>Therefore, to ban and eliminate women's strange and unusual clothing, the first thing to do is to fundamentally eliminate the psychology of women using this to please and cater to men. To remove this psychology of women, we must first abolish the social genes that cause women to indulge in lust, leave pleasure, and be sold as flesh.</p>
<h3>Seeing Off</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Dark night sky, dark metropolis, dark faces of people... In short, everything is dark, everything is surrounded by darkness.</p>
<p>In this dark environment, Tie was unfortunately sent to an unknown hospital. Suffering, naturally, was unavoidable. When he was in anguish, depressed, and tormented, making it difficult for him to endure, he became aware. He had complained about the unreasonableness of all this established form, and he had vowed to remove the current obstructing demon. His illness gradually improved, and no matter what, he would not forget the deeply imprinted shadow. At this point, he had prepared to dig and cultivate this difficult work. However, countless demonic hands were pulling at him, threatening him. As a result, he could not but retreat under double duress.</p>
<p>A few days later, he gave me this letter!</p>
<p>! ... Brother was misled by female lust, his reputation was ruined. I want to commit suicide, but I am afraid that the world will despise me. To avenge and雪恨, I do not have the ability. Staying here for a long time, my eyes and spirit are hurt, so it is better to leave this source of sin. ... I plan to take a boat back to my hometown tomorrow night, because my hometown, although bankrupt, has its own natural 清趣, unlike the city, which specializes in showing off 声色...</p>
<p>In order to have a last word at the farewell, I ran to his house very early after finishing work. Pushing open the door, the order in the room was very chaotic. Tie's face was covered with a very forced joy. Facing me, he did not say anything, only smiled bitterly, as if wanting people to understand the meaning of it.</p>
<p>At the beginning of summer, although the hours of daylight have increased, in the blink of an eye, the lights were on again. I do not know why, but today I only feel emptiness in my heart. The electric lights are also particularly dim, and everywhere shows a kind of desolation.</p>
<p>Dinner was set on the six-immortal table. This time, I added a few dishes with the remaining meal tickets and bought some yellow wine to extinguish the inner gloom. We sat opposite each other, the air was very solemn, solemn, almost frighteningly solemn. The heart sound was playing clearly. The wine was slowly reduced, and it was dry. There was no mirror, but I only felt a little fever on my face, and my eyes were hot.</p>
<p>The clock struck ten times. The Zhabei after the war was as silent as death. The night sky was so dark, without stars, without moonlight, without flowing clouds. Two rickshaws were running on the bumpy stone road. Beside the road, there were no tall buildings or mansions. Those low ones were a group of thatched sheds with a musty smell! There was no need to write down the road name, and there was no need to know the direction. Everything was left to him to run.</p>
<p>After turning several bays, we pulled up to a pier. Hey, that's right, the lights on the pier are quite bright! On the left, a boat was moored, and several people were climbing up one after another. The river is so black, and the sound of the paddles is so crisp!</p>
<p>I bought a berth, spread out the luggage, and sat down. There was nothing to say. Yes, 生離和死别 are the most painful in life, let alone people who have been greatly stimulated and have another kind of mood? I wanted to persuade him, and I wanted to comfort him, but how to open my mouth? A belly full of words was blocked in the throat, and I could not utter a single sound.</p>
<p>The night was deeper, and the wind from the river blew in from the window, making people feel a little chilly. Looking at the time, it was almost twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>! Goodbye, I wish you well on this trip, and I will have news from you often!</p>
<p>My voice was a little trembling, and his eyes were also a little red.</p>
<p>For some reason, the two of us held hands, and a burst of cold air was transmitted all the way from the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>No stars, no flowing clouds, no moonlight. Everything. Is covered by darkness</p>

<h3>Long Journey</h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>The sun has fallen into the mountain hollow on the opposite side. A heavily laden two-wheeled cart is advancing on the long journey, four in front and two in the back. They started their journey when they rose out of the sun. Now, their shadows are drawn long in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Except for a quick lunch at noon, they have not rested, pushing this heavily laden two-wheeled cart step by step from this town to that town. And year after year, they travel back and forth on this long journey, without a day of rest, just like they cannot not eat for a day.</p>
<p>The sun has set in its final moment, with only a few colorful clouds struggling at the end. The day is over. After crossing the small bridge in front, you can see the teahouse sign in this town.</p>
<p>The older one in front waved his hand. The other five, as if adding greater strength to their arms tanned by the sun, with a "yo" and an "yi," six bodies struggled to form an acute angle with the ground. The blood vessels on their calves burst out like earthworms. The cart was finally dragged onto the bridge deck. They gasped slightly and rudely wiped the sweat from their foreheads with the back of their hands. The ropes were unloaded from their shoulders, and the six bodies leaned back again, slowly lowering the vehicle off the bridge deck.</p>
<p>Following the sloping slide, they ran easily for a while. The tea house owner's laughing posture was already standing in front of them. They had handed over their responsibilities for the day. After the vehicles stopped, six people jumped under the tea shed, and the waiter had already brought three basins of water for washing their faces. Each person stripped off his upper body and washed, rudely gathered around the table, and drank the lukewarm tea, truly like oxen drinking water, a large tank of tea evenly distributed into the stomachs of six travelers.</p>
<p>This is the happiest time of their day. The evening curtain has already covered them, and the night breeze is blowing on his strong body, as comfortable as being stroked by a lover. Some also slightly close their eyelids, their heads leaning against the pillar of the tea shed, fantasizing about their hometown. This must be the time when the children are catching cicadas.</p>
<p>The tea house owner, always laughing, seeing that they were resting comfortably, bit his dry tobacco pipe and ran over, laughing loudly first:</p>
<p>"Guys, what are you eating?"</p>
<p>Although this is a daily routine, and has been for years, eating some large buns and beef, the boss seems to be relieved only after asking; and without telling jokes, if you want to change the taste, this tea house cum restaurant owner simply cannot make a second dish.</p>
<p>"Come on, stop nagging!"</p>
<p>The older one shouted impatiently. Among them, they do not know what politeness is. They say what they want to say in their hearts straightforwardly, so the boss, after hearing this, still laughs and hurries to the stove.</p>
<p>After filling their bellies, they treasuredly took out cigarettes from their pockets to smoke. Some smoked only a small stub before quickly extinguishing it and hiding it back in its place. At this time, they were all in high spirits. The boss also joined their group, chatting and laughing wildly, talking about women, and they made even more grotesque gestures. They had forgotten the hardships of the long journey and completely immersed themselves in the embrace of the night.</p>
<p>However, "Brothers, let's sleep!" the older one ordered. He pointed to the vehicle under the moonlight, saying that they had to unload the cargo before dawn tomorrow to make it back to town in time.</p>
<p>The tea tables and benches inside the tea shed were all their temporary sleeping beds. Without mattresses or quilts, they slept so casually, completing their responsibility as human beings for the day.</p>
<h3>Mother and Son</h3>
<p>— Wei Huan</p>
<p>Six-year-old Bao'er, lively and clever, was doted on by everyone who saw him. He had a pair of big, round eyes and a nimble little mouth.</p>
<p>"Mom... Mom..." he used this tone to call his mother when nothing was happening.</p>
<p>His mother was doing her needlework when she heard the call, and subconsciously glanced at him. In the past, she would have quickly looked away and continued sewing the clothes she hadn't finished. But today was a little different, as if she had seen a secret.</p>
<p>"Bao'er!" Come here. Who caused this blood on your head? Tell me quickly! She stared at Bao'er with a stern look.</p>
<p>"Mom, it doesn't hurt," he said, looking at his mother as if asking for forgiveness.</p>
<p>He often saw his mother get angry, so he would alertly hide in the corner of the wall, ready to run away quickly if she came to hit him.</p>
<p>"Are you still not going to tell me?" Her voice was obviously angry. She threw down the clothes in her lap, quickly picked him up, and gently wiped away the blood. The blood hadn't dried yet, so she pressed incense ash on it.</p>
<p>"Bao'er, you have no father or siblings. What a hard life! In the future, don't go out to play with A He anymore. Just play here nicely, Bao'er, do you understand?" Her voice trembled as she spoke.</p>
<p>Seeing that his mother's anger had subsided, A Bao quickly slipped away.</p>
<p>Outside the gate was the home of his friend, A He, who was two years older than him and had a fierce face. The gentle A Bao was often beaten by him. He went out the gate and seemed to have forgotten what his mother had told him. He quietly stood in the corner of the wall, peeking at them eating cherries. He watched them eat with relish, the cherries red and sweet, stuffing them into their mouths one by one. Saliva dripped constantly into his stomach, and even flowed out of his lips. He imagined that his index finger tasted like their cherries. His black, shiny eyes rolled like a hawk's as he thought of seizing a handful when they weren't paying attention to see what they tasted like. He tiptoed to the table and gently grabbed three cherries, but A He's sister saw him.</p>
<p>"Brother, A Bao is stealing our cherries!" They eagerly chased after him and finally caught him.</p>
<p>At this time, A Bao still refused to let go of the cherries in his hand, and their white hands pinched his small hand until it was red. "You stole our things, and you still won't let go?" The siblings shouted. He refused, they persisted, and a chaotic fight broke out. A Bao was outnumbered and cried loudly, and at the same time, he was hit on the head again.</p>
<p>His mother ran out at the sound of his crying, took A Bao's hand, and led him home.</p>
<p>"Bao'er, who bullied you again?"</p>
<p>A Bao cried and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>"Don't cry. Your father will bring you something even better to eat tomorrow," she said gently, stroking the bump on his head.</p>
<p>She lowered her head and sewed tirelessly. Two years passed quietly like her thread and needle. But she didn't feel lonely. All her future hopes were pinned on A Bao. No matter how extremely annoyed she was, she only had to look at A Bao, and all her troubles would disappear. Just like people in the darkness eagerly awaiting the coming of light.</p>
<p>The round moon poured down like mercury on the ground, grass, roofs, and all the scenery, turning it into a beautiful and serene village. A gentle breeze carried a warm breath, caressing the mother and son. A Bao stayed by his mother's side, constantly looking at her face. "Mom, what happened to the story you told yesterday? Did his father come back? Please tell it to me again!" A Bao used his clever eyes to ask his mother to continue the story.</p>
<p>"Bao'er, you like to listen? Then I'll continue... At that time, she wrote letters several times to urge him to return. One afternoon, he really came back... He was very thin and pitiful. Bao'er... He was suffering from terrible consumption, and there wasn't enough money to treat him. He hadn't been home for even a month before he abandoned his mother and son and went far away, perhaps never to return. He left behind a four-year-old child and a young woman. In this world, a son without a father and a woman without a husband never received people's sympathy... Their life afterwards was undoubtedly very difficult. Her child, it is said, is now six years old. His mother loves him very much, and his name is Bao'er." As she spoke, A Bao fell fast asleep on her lap. Tears fell from her eyes like broken beads, shimmering in the bright moonlight.</p>

<h3>Nudity Movement</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>The body is originally the model of a spiritual animal, and humans are of course the same. The difference between male and female is a physiological difference with different forms and personalities. The difference in physiological relations between men and women also leads to many divisions and miracles. In fact, the five senses and limbs are not much different between people, and life is the same.</p>
<p>Those who create theories of beauty and ugliness in the world often use external appearance as the standard. Therefore, for thousands of years, Song Yu, Pan An, Xi Shi, and Wang Qiang have been envied by the world, while Meng Yang, Momo and the like have been abandoned by everyone.</p>
<p>In the past, when Xi Shi frowned due to heart disease, everyone thought it was beautiful. Therefore, later beauties always had to have a bit of sickness. However, in modern times, when European styles swept across China, those weak and sickly beauties jumped up and transformed into female heroes with strong bodies, nakedly offering the beauty of their flesh to the people. As a result, on the streets and markets, we often see modern misses with curves fully exposed, jade legs looming, and bare breasts and arms swaggering through the city, attracting a group of lustful men who are truly drooling. Recently, some people feel that baring their chests and arms is not enough, and they have boldly advocated the nudity movement, determined to completely expose the male and female secrets that people have avoided talking about in ancient and modern times. For several years, the nudity movement has been rampant, but unfortunately it has been banned by the authorities, so it cannot spread quickly and become popular everywhere. The general naked comrades feel very disappointed!</p>
<p>According to this trend, it first started in Germany, followed by the United States. In our country, Hankou, several years ago, there was also a rumor about this, but after a while, it was banned by the authorities. Recently, Hong Kong, in the place called Xiangfen Liao, the holy land of nudity, has a "Nudity Sports Meeting". The chairman is a Westerner named Dalian, and there are quite a few comrades in the meeting. However, no women have joined yet, which is a bit of a pity! But they have a positive approach, that is, every member must bring a woman to participate. Recently, the weather has been getting hotter, and the muggy heat is approaching. Therefore, the naked movement has also become active in a timely manner. It is said that the association has also prepared to operate in various provinces and ports. According to Dalian's expression to others, he seems to have some confidence in this. This matter seems credible, because we saw in the Japanese newspaper in Shanghai that "The hot summer is approaching, and the nudity movement is rampant in Shanghai. It is said that a branch has been established in the Hongkou area, and it is said that the concession will never allow it to stand..." That's right, we seem to vaguely remember in our vague minds that this happened around this time last year. But unfortunately (?), the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce learned of this news and immediately sent a letter to the concession authorities to ban it. As a result, this sensational, highly anticipated nudity movement did not appear in Shanghai after all, and we can only lament our shallow eye blessings! If this year's action is tolerated by the concession authorities, then it seems that those half-covered and half-hidden things can disappear, and we can simply play a completely naked and unclothed beauty of nudity. Anyway, everyone has a body, so what mystery is there? Returning to the original state and returning to natural life, wouldn't that be great?</p>
<p>The advocates say: "The nudity movement is not a shameful thing. It has a great relationship with mankind, because sunbathing, air bathing, and water bathing in nature can make people's bodies strong and clean. Moreover, we have a clear conscience and a clean body. We frankly meet you and me. In fact, we cannot say that it is a shameful thing. Humans are not shameless, but stealing, adultery, and being a prostitute, doing things secretly, this is shameful! In China for thousands of years, the relationship between men and women has been seen as too mysterious, so there is such a legacy!..." According to their expression, it is worthy of being justified and has a bright attitude. It is just like a certain doctor who advocated "sexology" a few years ago, which is really wonderful and bold. Whether this fact can be realized, we may as well wait and see.</p>
<h3>Selling</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>In order to continue life, we have to find ways to maintain life. However, in order to maintain life, everything has to be sold. Selling personality, selling conscience, selling the body, selling wives and children, selling smiles, selling blood, selling labor, selling brainpower, selling... Good! Sell it, sell it as much as possible! Anyway, in the real world, everything has to be sold, and everything has to be sold cheaply!</p>
<p>However, I have no conscience to sell, and personality is also a worthless thing. The body is a stinky skin, and wives and children are even more unnecessary to say, of course no one wants them. Smiles are bitter smiles, full of hot tears, who would welcome them? As for blood, I am also a person suffering from anemia, where is there blood to sell, so my only sales target is labor and brainpower; although, I also know that selling labor and brainpower is the most painful thing and you cannot get a reasonable price, but you can't do it without selling. And, sometimes, maybe even labor and brainpower have not been accepted by the master! I want to not sell! However, the heavy burden of life is tightly pressed on my chest; that would make me involuntarily sell it. However, as a result of the sale, life is still not continued.</p>
<p>Speaking of my current life, it is truly a non-human life, only in subjugation and under oppression all day long. A full seventeen hours of work a day, and the reward is only a few cents, the food, housing, and clothing are not as good as those labor saints. What's more, in addition to selling labor, I have to sell brainpower! Who knows the pain of selling brainpower, but even the freedom to sell brainpower has been almost deprived of me.</p>
<p>Humans need life to maintain life, but where can life be found? In such a society, in such a world, everywhere they are shouting "recession", and various industries are overstaffed. Finding a place to eat is as difficult as climbing to the sky. However, the world is full of contradictions, and society is developing in a deformed way. In this unbalanced state, those who advance excessively advance, and those who decline successively decline. Those who sell brainpower and labor are always not full, on the contrary, those who sit still all day long eat until their stomachs are bulging. On the one hand, money and women are dancing in their arms, while we only have brainpower and sweat blood spurting out, constantly spurting out! Alas! What kind of society is this?</p>
<h3>The Literary Arena and the Business Arena</h3>
<p>— Qi Sheng</p>
<p>The literary arena was originally a place for people who wielded pens to make friends through writing. However, since a group of merchant writers with abacuses swaggered in, the literary arena has become a business arena. Merchant writers do not write in order to "make friends through writing", but aim to make money. Because they aim to make money, they carelessly produce shoddy goods to deceive readers, which is called selling savage heads. And this business arena of literature is just like Qinglian Pavilion on Fourth Horse Road. There are merchants calculating and selling goods, and there are also wild chickens who sell their souls coming in with the merchants. Merchants only care about profit and do not care about personality. Sometimes it doesn't matter if they sell their personality together with their goods, as long as there is money to be made. Wild chickens flatter on the left and right and are good at pandering. They also don't care if they sell their personality together with their goods, as long as the patrons pay. Thus, the stench of copper fills the air, and they are proud and complacent. Merchant writers sell savage heads because they aim to make money. Therefore, they are all-rounders, pleasing everyone, and they also have the so-called turtle policy. The so-called turtle policy is what the "Zeng Guang" book says, "Recently learned the turtle's method, shrink your head where you should shrink your head." No matter how people scold, shrink your head and don't care, that is, the great man can bend and stretch the noble virtue of forbearance. And the wild chicken writer's wonderful trick to climb the dragon lies in praising the savage head, flattering on the left and right, and getting a few words of praise from those who really get the savage head. Flies attach to the tail of a thoroughbred horse, soaring thousands of miles, with sources on the left and right.</p>
<p>The transaction of selling savage heads has become a good business in the literary arena. Recently, there is a brand-new and outstanding business strategy of selling dead heads. It is said that literary people are valued after death. Therefore, merchants gather, and the prices of dead heads rise. The original products of savage heads are ultimately limited, and dead heads are even rarer. The market situation is that those with high prices are rising higher and higher, and there is no doubt that savage heads and dead heads can manipulate market prices. The business arena focuses on competition, and the literary arena is no exception. As a result of competition, wild chicken writers are promoted to savage heads by those who sell savage heads. At that time, if the market price of savage heads does not plummet, I am afraid that the old savage heads will become dead heads, and the market price of dead heads will rise even higher, which is expected.</p>

<h3>Widow's Arch (1)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>It was almost unheard of for a six-year-old child to be so alert as to get up quietly by himself as soon as it dawned. Naturally, this made him very excited, as long as he thought about yesterday evening, when the hired hand Grey Chicken promised to take him to the Tianban to catch crickets this morning, and he could also go to the village to play. The reason was that going to the village was very rare for him. Although his home was only four or five hundred steps away from the village, in his habit, it was almost like going to another world.</p>
<p>With a strange heart, he quietly groped to open every door leading to the kitchen, went out the back door and walked towards the grey house. Extreme joy leaped in his heart, and he whispered along the way:</p>
<p>"Brother Grey Chicken!... "</p>
<p>But there was no answering sound, which made him very worried. Could it be that he had already left? Sure enough, he was not seen sleeping in the grey house, and he was almost crying. He ran from the vegetable garden to the gate in a panic. The faint light was sparsely scattered on the ground. From a distance, he seemed to see a stone in front of him. He carefully hoped to step on the stone and step over it, but what he stepped on was a puddle of water. It turned out that it had rained sometime, but he remembered that there was not a drop of rain yesterday evening when the spider was busy spinning its web. Running all the way out of the gate, under the parasol tree that covered the road, he seemed to see Grey Chicken still carrying an empty basket and walking forward, with several people he recognized in front of him, all of whom were temporarily hired to help harvest the rice. So he ran over desperately, grabbed the corner of his clothes, and almost cried. He saw him stop and rub the top of the little master's head and say:</p>
<p>"What? Do you really want me to take you? If your mother finds out, she will scold me."</p>
<p>"I don't care," the little master said, "You take me."</p>
<p>"What does he want to do?" Another person asked. They all stopped walking.</p>
<p>"Last night, he told me to take him to Tianban to catch crickets."</p>
<p>"Catch crickets? There are plenty in your own garden, why go to the village!"</p>
<p>"Who knows, he just wants to go to the village with us to play."</p>
<p>"Hmph, this child is too pitiful. He is locked up at home all day long, and no children come to play with him. How can he not want to run outside?"</p>
<p>"Okay," Grey Chicken said again, "Sit in the rice basket, and I'll carry you. But if your mother scolds you later, don't blame me."</p>
<p>So the little master Shi Jimin happily climbed into the basket. The other basket was filled with. A large earthenware pot of tea. It was just right to carry on the shoulder, and the weight in the front and back was not much different.</p>

<p>Film Special Issue</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Chinese Film Actors (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Dan Feng</p>
<p>As for Zhao Dan and Zheng Junli, we know that both are talented actors who have achieved great success from the stage to the screen. Zhao Dan in particular is the most talented young leading man in the Star Film Company. In addition, they both have good academic backgrounds and a deep understanding of society. Of course, their future is infinitely bright, and I hereby wish them well. However, the news is that Zheng Jun has been infatuated with a woman who likes to eat chili peppers, and the things he used to be enthusiastic about are now put aside. Brother Zhao Dan is also in love with a newly discovered stage actor. In this way, we cannot help but worry. I would like to say to the two gentlemen, do not lightly sacrifice your great future in the midst of "I love you, you love me." As for the comparison in acting skills, Zhao Dan is more versatile, while Zheng Junli is most successful with the "Life" archetype. On the other hand, He Feiguang, Jiang Junchao, Gong Jianong, Sun Min and others, who also entered the screen as young leading men, have individually achieved occasional success, while the latter two are somewhat more sluggish. Only Zhang Zhenduo is really not worth praising. Although he is that old, he sometimes still dresses up as a young leading man, which is difficult to understand. If possible, he should dress up as a middle-aged man and completely abandon the elements of civilization drama.</p>
<p>Undeniably, a decadent life and lack of knowledge are the fatal wounds of the failure of some actors. In particular, some actresses are even more infected with this common problem. We don't have to point out who is innocent and who is not, and we don't have to use someone's past misconduct as a focus for deliberate attacks. However, the facts are all there. Film actors who truly hope to improve themselves should improve their private lives. Only in this way can they prevent others from criticizing them, and only then can they not be regarded as women who are being played with. Only in this way can they become complete social beings and seek progress in acting. Isn't that right? The reason why actresses are looked down upon and regarded as equal to prostitutes, the reason why someone shouts to jump out of the dark film circle, and the reason why it is rumored who is the mistress of a high-ranking official, is it not because they invite insult upon themselves? Although we also admit that in today's society, it is indeed not an easy task for a woman with quite a beautiful appearance to be a perfect person and not to sell her body as a commodity. However, actresses who are expected by millions of viewers must realize that they must cherish themselves and maintain their integrity. For the sake of their own future, it is meaningful to live a hard life. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "The House of Rothschild"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The House of Rothschild</p>
<p>丨Nanjing丨 (1)</p>
<p>It is said that this is a historical film and that Twentieth Century Fox considers it their greatest production of the year. A historical drama is, of course, a screenplay based on a certain page of history. However, the fact that a certain page of history can be adopted as a film subject today is by no means accidental. For example, in the current China, if the tyrannical rule of Qin Shi Huang, leading up to the uprising of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, were made into a film, it would definitely not be without value. The historical fragment, after passing through the worldview of the playwright, and the history of Napoleon's great wars, can be reflected in the film "The House of Rothschild," it must have its significance in the times. Therefore, we should never neglect the examination of the playwright's ideas of "The House of Rothschild" simply because it is a historical record. On the contrary, only in this way can we achieve a critique of the essence of the work.</p>
<p>(2) The story told in "The House of Rothschild" is as follows:</p>
<p>In a Jewish neighborhood, there is a group of ragged Jews. At dusk, they are sealed off by a chain-link net, separated from the outside world, and cannot associate with outsiders.</p>
<p>This group of God's chosen people is despised by people and becomes a lowly race. At the same time, in what people consider to be dirty and filthy lives, we see an old man hiding his money, telling his sons how to keep his money, and how they disguise themselves as poor scholars when officials come to extort money... Perhaps this is the so-called sketch of stingy Jews. Until his death, he taught his five children how to increase the profits of their property and make it a means of fighting for freedom and equality. 丨丨 This can be considered the prelude.</p>
<p>Next, we see the Rothschild bank spread across all parts of Europe. They have expanded their father's wealth, and when Napoleon swept across Europe, high-ranking officials in every location of the bank were borrowing money from them to use as military expenses to resist Napoleon. At this time, the British general Wellington also arrived at the "House of Rothschild" in London. Due to the loans from their brothers, the allied powers conquered Napoleon and exiled him to the Balkans. However, the freedom and equality that they hoped for for the Jews were not obtained, and Jewish houses were pelted with stones. Even Wellington's telling Nathan about the public debt tender did not achieve victory. Until Napoleon escaped from the island again, the whole of Europe was frightened as if it were in an earthquake. So the politicians and generals of the allied powers had to turn to this Jewish house for help again, and agreed to their demands for guaranteeing freedom and equality. Later, the Rothschild brothers took great risks. Until after the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon was defeated again, and the protagonist Nathan was granted the title of Baron by the British Royal Family, and the Jewish girl was also able to marry a general under Wellington.</p>
<p>(3) What does this story tell us? Jews love peace, Jews made a fortune in the great war, Jews obtained peerages for supplying the Allied forces' military expenses, and Jews obtained freedom and equality after Napoleon's defeat. We do not need to argue here whether these are all true historical records, but the playwright's understanding is revealed here. If wealthy Jews can take out money to strike at the European hegemon, they can raise their status. But after Napoleon's defeat, is it true peace? And is their aid to military expenses for the sake of establishing peace? Rather than saying it is for the sake of justice or righteousness, it is more like speculation in the war by the wealthy. Teaching wealthy people to sacrifice everything for the sake of maintaining peace is, in fact, rarely seen. As for gaining national freedom and equality from their hands, it is even more precious. However, we can believe that wealthy people buy peerages through military speculation, but this is by no means national liberation.</p>
<p>Further speaking, in the European war, many people made fortunes through military speculation, but Germany's defeat is not world peace. Although there was a short period of capitalist stability after the war, this period has long passed, and new forces are constantly growing, and a second world war is about to break out. Therefore, true peace is never built on a small number of people.</p>
<p>Therefore, the consciousness of the playwright expressed here contains a certain amount of agitation. As for perhaps someone saying that this is a reaction to Hitler's expulsion of the Jews, perhaps there is a possibility of interpretation here. If so, is it to teach the expelled Jewish tycoons to help military ambition to eliminate dictatorial Germany and strike at Hitler's nationalism? This is something we do not understand.</p>
<p>In short, we must not believe the instigation in this film and think that it is a work that sympathizes with the liberation of small and weak nations. On the contrary, their liberation is nothing more than the liberation of the wealthy. Even in the present day, Jewish tycoons hold the great power of the financial world in Europe, while, on the other hand, the working masses of the Jewish nation have always been without land, engaged in lowly hard labor in various parts of Europe and the United States, and unequal treatment is still wrapped around their entire bodies like iron chains.</p>
<p>However, in the current situation of rampant nationalism, Jewish tycoons are inevitably being squeezed out by other ethnic groups due to ethnic relations. This is particularly evident in Germany. Therefore, teaching the Jews who control the hub of finance to help the Allied powers eliminate the German warmongers who are currently rampaging, just as eliminating Napoleon in those years, is not without reason. At a time when arms reduction conferences cannot achieve the results they imagine, this is the political ambition of the filmmakers, but so-called world peace is, in any case, a terrible deception.</p>
<p>(4) As for why this film shows such goodwill towards England? Of course, we cannot ignore the historical basis, because Wellington's success was indeed due to a great deal of help from the Rothschilds. Also, the British purchase of the Suez Canal was also made possible by the Rothschild family taking out money. What's more, Arliss and Caloff are all British.</p>
<p>(5) From the overall work, in the development of the play from beginning to end, the playwright is extremely clever and fully maintains his proposition, and it is difficult to see contradictions in his consciousness. For example, he wants the tycoon Nathan to make demands for freedom and equality to the political authorities, forcing them to sign, and first teaches us to see that their own family is also subjected to people throwing stones, so that the Nathan brothers deeply feel the need for equal treatment. Although, on the other hand, we also see that at the time of the public debt tender, he did not gain the upper hand due to the manipulation of those politicians. Until the very end, he naturally develops the story to the point where the British court is greatly ennobled, and concludes his proposition with victory. On the other hand, Nathan's daughter's marriage to a British military officer, although it only occupies a small part in the play, the fact that she cannot intermarry to the point of marrying a high-ranking general emphasizes the theme of the play.</p>
<p>(6) Similarly, from the director to the performance, they are all very successful. From the full fulfillment of the dramatic elements of each scene to the grasp of the TEMPO of the play, it shows the highest development of film art at the current stage. Perhaps some people say that when writing about the branches of the other four brothers outside of England, the director's use of the exact same technique is inevitably clumsy. However, this is an inappropriate comment, because since it is not possible to let a story develop evenly along four lines, then one must concentrate very concisely on one main line and completely use the method of omission to skip the remaining branches. Therefore, the adoption of the same method is a bold and reasonable attempt.</p>
<p>As for George Arliss' and Boris Karloff's acting skills, they have truly reached the point of perfection. No, even the actress who played the mother of the Nathan brothers was very successful. We can simply say that every unimportant supporting role has just the right achievement. If we want to see the art of modern film, especially acting techniques, then we believe that this "House of Rothschild" is worth paying close attention to.</p>
<p>(7) What remains to be said is that the success of the scenery or photography and sound recording is almost something we do not need to praise here specifically. Anyway, under the enormous capital, these are undeniably achieved.</p>
<p>However, some people are completely confused by the word "great" and accept the entirety of the work uncritically. The so-called "the resistance of a small and weak nation, while at the same time appealing to the world for peace, in order to fulfill the mission of film," this bold and erroneous argument should be what we criticize.</p>
<h3>The Three Protagonists of "The Cup of Joy" (Left) Spencer Tracy (Center) Movie Novel "Three Sisters Star Company Production Li Pingqian Director (1)" Xiao Rong Stars: Hu Die, Yan Yuexian, Lin Li, Sun Min, Zhao Dan, etc. (1)</h3>
<p>Lazy autumn has arrived, the withered yellow leaves have fallen from the branches, and gusts of cold wind are blowing, adding a bit of autumnal mood to this world. At this time, the famous painter Wu Yunlin bid farewell to this cruel world, leaving behind his elderly wife, his three lovely daughters, and hundreds of carefully crafted masterpieces from his lifetime, and quietly passed away. In order to mourn and commemorate this famous painter, his family members and his students opened a "Posthumous Works Exhibition" for him and sold his works. Those taking care of the scene that day, in addition to his three daughters, Jingfen (Hu Die), Ruifen (Yan Yuexian), and Shufen (Lin Li), also included his students Zhao Xuan (Zhao Dan) and Ma Yicang (Sun Min), etc. The gentlemanly student Ma Yicang (Sun Min) looked at a portrait of a beautiful woman and thought silently in his heart, "How beautiful this woman is! But it's a pity that this one is not for sale." He asked Jingfen in a low voice, "Is this photo for sale?" "Ah!" Jingfen seemed to be troubled when she heard this. After a moment of contemplation, she said, "Ah! You have to ask my mother!" "Then I'll just have to come to your house tomorrow to discuss it with your teacher's wife." The next morning, this gentlemanly college student drove an eight-cylinder Buick car to Jingfen's house. As a result of the discussion, Mother Wu was unwilling to sell it, because it was a posthumous portrait of her younger sister. But Yicang had no choice. He saw that everything in the room seemed to be messy. He tilted his head and asked very affectionately in a kind tone, "Looking at them like this, are they going to move?" Mother Wu smiled bitterly and nodded, "That's right! We don't have a house and we're in trouble!" Hearing this, Yicang turned his head to look at the beautiful three sisters and said, "Teacher's wife, it's a bit presumptuous to say this, but I wonder what you think? I have a new villa that's empty." Mother Wu was still being polite, but Yicang said again, "Don't be polite, old lady! We are teacher and student!" The "Three Sisters" also urged, "Mother, let's move!" In the end, the old woman could not resist Yicang's repeated requests and the encouragement of her three daughters, and she finally agreed. They moved into their new home. These three innocent and lively sisters were all angels in the eyes of the gentlemanly Ma Yicang, especially the quiet and gentle eldest sister Jingfen, who was the one he loved day and night in his mind. So one day he asked, "Miss Wu, can you allow me to paint a portrait of you?" Jingfen said, "I have to discuss it with my mother first!" The next day, Jingfen discussed this with her mother, and her mother agreed immediately. Rui and Shu also supported it. Suddenly, the poor boy Zhao Xuan ran over. When he heard about this, he expressed his opinion: "I still shouldn't associate with him too much! Whenever the teacher was alive, he would scold him harshly!" (To be continued) The novel "Till Seas Dry and Rocks Rot" will be suspended for a few days due to the non-arrival of the continuation.</p>
