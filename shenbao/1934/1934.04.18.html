<p>康藏糾紛。時起時伏。其所以起伏不定未見積極之原因。一則以地方邊遠。交通梗澁。負責官吏。祇須暫時無事。抱得過且過之苟安觀念。再則藏人迄未有十分嚴密組織。主動者亦非有急速席捲康藏之企圖。故遷延復遷延。敷衍再敷衍。以掩飾當前之危局。現在達賴已圓寂。藏衛一切政敎。皆陷於停滯狀態。班禪又卓錫東南。一時不易西返。則藏中缺乏政敎主持之中堅。其東犯陰謀與服從中央之傾向。勢難立時確定。是以興兵來犯之舉。恐尚屬一時暴動性質。非眞有戰爭之意味也。頃者劉文輝已與當地藏民相約。訂定恢復大金寺辦法。果我方辦理得宜。藏民内向者究占多數。則少數狡獪之徒。不難依法治理。或以德意感化之也。</p>
<p>近年來達賴似已學悟親英非長久之計。内向之心頗切。所惜者其志願未能完全實現。班禪亦未返藏。康藏糾紛。因以延而未决耳。設使西康當局。能及時奮起。一面整頓吏治。一面充實軍備。放棄歷年來川省鬩墻私鬥之恶習。革面洗心。爲整個邊防籌劃縱西康一區。不足以言國防。然而鎭撫藏民。掃除不良分子。則此實力。已足應付而有餘。所可慮者。西康之富源。尚完全埋藏地中。絲毫未曾開發。在最短期内。又爲國内資力及交通所制限。殊不易實行開發。僅恃少數手工力以維持廣大邊陲之安定。殊爲不足。况値此列强環伺之際。動多掣肘。對付更感困難。而北隣康藏之靑海新疆。復値多事。不已漢回紛擾此種影響。及於内地關係者尚微。而於西藏則甚嚴重也。其間更困難者。卽四川積年内戰。軍閥相互仇視。彼此欺騙。殆已成公開之狀態。如不澈底淸除。則易啓遠人離二之心。召内部紛亂之漸。故非有整個計劃。齊以具體的指導。恐無成功之希望也。夫西康農業。在今日尚未充分發達。靑海則仍在牧畜時代。欲收指臂合作之效。勢甚不易。經濟方面旣與内地同處困窘。政治又不能卽刻有光明之設施此誠最棘手之問題也。</p>
<p>然則所謂整個計劃何在。曰惟有切實開發而已。此開發計劃。如再不切實做去。恐時將不我許耳。蓋西隣之窺伺。已非一日。中亞細亞之爭奪戰。其實際行動之劇烈。並不下於太平洋之海軍競爭。我國所處地位。又正相同。設使我國能就西康靑海。先行基礎上最低限度之廉潔政治。使民族自覺。不致陷於泥塗。則西藏或可長作屏藩。爲我中華民國之一忠實分子也。至新疆方面。紛爭已久。口頭勸說。或一紙警吿。實難收效。據今日情勢觀測。新疆糾紛之解决。恐不能不運用兵力以事遠征。惟此種勸遠企圖。實現亦實不易。然舍此而外。更將有何法以保持西北。植民族復興之基礎耶。</p>
<p>爲新疆及極北一帶邊防基礎之河套。在往昔卽居十分重要地位。現在平綏路旣通。内蒙處非常緊急狀態。河套關係。乃更見嚴重。匪特爲西北邊防之軍事中心。且亦爲穀類之資源地。惟歷年以來。每駐重兵。幾經喪亂。致移　之民。日漸减少。昔爲豐富之農區。近則僅有荒地。卽欲從事墾殖。而耕牛缺乏仔種稀少。勢非重新籌劃。亦少更生之望。一旦國際間發生重大事變。如日蘇戰爭果實現者。則我國邊防。不能不有所整備。設不能充分利用河套穀倉惟爲軍用食糧之泉源。損失亦甚重大。是故欲作邊防上之凖備工夫。在極西方面。必須先安川康政局。使彼川閥接受中央之正確指導。深悔以往内訌之錯誤。然後經濟建設。乃有着手餘地。藏人方不致反覆。至在另一方面。如何援助新疆。如何維擊内蒙。須先充實兵力。與刷新政治而其前提。則皆有賴於河套農業之開發。蓋經濟基礎之健實。實爲鞏固邊心之重要條件也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）財相張伯倫定今日午後在下院提出其第三届預算案、在數小時前、議院已無虚席、下院共有議員六百五十人、而坐位僅有四百五十席、故在今日侵晨、各議員卽紛紛預留坐位、以免向隅、午後下院之景象、至形燦爛、全院人滿、幾無插足之地、議員多有不得坐位、而入旁聽席者、貴賓席中亦早人滿、前排坐各國大使及其他外交家、蓋皆欲知英國如何恒能使其預算案收支平衡、而尤注意財相上年如何能獲豐富之盈餘也、貴族席中亦吿人滿、各命婦華麗之服裝、益增議院之𤈎華、院中毫無緊張之象、院外則民衆麕集、竚觀閣員之入、而財相入時、衆尤注目、</p>
<p>財相旣入、語新聞記者曰、余希望余之建議能爲衆所滿意、而視爲回復繁榮時代之起點、</p>
<p>財相並定今晚以其豫算案撮要由無綫電播送全國、全國民衆今方引領以待之、</p>
<p>開會之後、卽照例從事問訉、而各議員紛紛交談、故閣員怱遽作答之語聲、殊難明晰以聞、無何、問訉之時間終止、議院遂成一度支委員會、議長退席、主席卽請財相出席、時爲三點四十四分、</p>
<p>於日財相於歡呼聲中起立於閣員席前、啓財政部與歷史有關之紅革公文篋、取出其預算案、演說約一小時半之久、財相演詞謂本届預算案、在較前二年更見淸朗之空氣中提出、殊可令人欣慰、最近十二個月内之事績、證明政府之努力漸獲效、現已呈露一種希望與信任之新精神例如二釐半息之公債劵、今價視大戰前爲高、工業產量增加甚巨、收支平衡業已恢復、一切進步、幾全由内國市塲之擴張有以致之、</p>
<p>盈餘三千一百萬鎊、今後不能望其復見、雖輸出貿易已有起色、但較之數年前猶相形見絀、過去一年中之眞正盈餘可謂爲三千九百萬鎊左右、因還債凖備金亦取給於此也、國人如注視電氣之銷費數運輸鋼鐵出產與房屋建築數、則定見商業之切實回復、英國已恢復第一輸出國之地位、但從前國際貿易循以自由流動之途徑、現仍閉塞、經濟的國家主義之感想仍蔓延無已、故此途徑今尤難望其通過、國人更有可畏之新競爭、以攫取英國所有之貿易</p>
<p>統計一年收入、爲七二四·五六七·○○○鎊、支出爲六九三·四九一·○○○鎊、故收入超過支出三千一百萬鎊有奇、但國債之非常低利率、不能望其永久存在、國人之繳付所得稅者履行義務、異常踴躍、至屬可嘉、英國在此一年中收入一筆最大各稅、爲歷史上所僅見、</p>
<p>匯兌平凖金亦有盈餘、上年所盈餘者、將用以償還債務而補前年之不足、</p>
<p>至於本届財政年度、英國欠美之債務、與英國所可收之戰債與賠欵、因未有新發展、故擬仍照去年辦法、不在預算中有所規定、</p>
<p>上届茶稅收入、約短少三十五萬鎊、此定爲限制印度錫蘭與荷屬印度茶葉之進口所致、蓋普通茶價因限制而高漲、致需求不旺也、糖之稅收、亦短少一百萬鎊左右、此乃優待帝國糖產之結果、</p>
<p>固定債務仍將爲二二四、○○○、○○○鎊、故估計支出將爲六九八、○○○、○○○鎊、預料關稅與國產稅連啤酒在内收入可望增多、查啤酒稅一項、上年收入數預算增五百萬鎊、故啤酒稅之總額本年當可達五八、五○○、○○○鎊、</p>
<p>關稅與國產稅之總收入、上年爲二九○、○○○、○○○鎊、照目前之稅率、估計收入當可達七二七、○○○、○○○鎊、而在釐訂後當有二九、○○○、○○○鎊之盈餘、</p>
<p>上届預算盈餘之巨、爲過去十年所未有、可使政府開始一般人所久盼之救濟、以减輕其過去數年中犧牲之擔負、但時機一至、渠將有以受國人之望、</p>
<p>財相於是提議有權擔保爲掉換現有擔保借欵而發行之新債劵、又提議减輕汽車馬力捐、每匹馬力由一鎊减至十五先令、並恢復一九三一年各項减俸之半數、至於失業救濟金之縮减、今後將完全恢復、間接稅不减、所得稅將减六便士、</p>
<p>財部繼復宣稱、恢復減俸半數之追加預算、將自七月一日算起、估計此項恢復、全年共需五百五十萬鎊、（此項一部分恢復與公務員高級文官敎員警察海陸空軍法官等有關、）估計所得稅收入、可得二四○、○○○、○○○鎊、比上年多一一、○○○、○○○鎊、附稅可收五○、○○○、○○○鎊、死稅可收七六、○○○、○○○鎊、財相又聲明失業救濟金之恢復、必須首先實行、不日將提出一案、規定自七月一日起完全恢復失業救濟金、估計本年須需三、六○○、○○○鎊、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>日本警察的精密嚴整、號稱爲世界第二、差不多的違法行爲、都不能逃脫法網、但是近年以來、左翼團體的地下運動、格外發達、屢次的檢舉、並不能將猛烈的運動撲滅、而且大有燎原之勢、右傾運動、也可以得到一部分人的同情、甚至可以得到現役軍人與在鄕軍人的援助、因而他們的行動、格外便利些、但是缺點是在缺少武器、日本的手槍子彈、是可以公開買賣的、但不能像歐美諸國那樣自由、必須受當地警察官吏的限制、如有人要買一枝手槍、若干子彈、卽須在警署註册登記用了一顆子彈、也須如數呈報、否則一旦發生自殺或他殺案件、有手槍的人、卽應受檢查、然而在這樣綿密的組織之下、日本社會中所有未經註册的槍枝、竟多至不可勝計、而陸海軍人所佩帶的槍、還不在内、所以暗殺案件、竟層出不已、當道要人、無論是財閥·是官僚·都時存戒備、不敢說一定沒有事、</p>
<p>這次手槍的大秘密輸入、是從大森的川崎第百銀行分行、發生刦案的時候當局就發覺了、共產黨所用的槍械、是由神户小田槍砲火藥店所供給、那時候曾將小田東逮捕、在大阪地方裁庭廳判處徒刑一年、也不服提起上吿、去年二月卽保釋出獄、但是他依舊不肯放棄他秘密經營、的買賣、在别的同黨倉庫中、還寄放得有手槍三千八百零四枝、子彈三十三萬三千八百發、這是單就已經發現了的來說、其餘未發現的、還不知有多少呢、因爲他們運用非常巧妙、組織非常精密、牽聯的人又很廣泛、所以現在所發現的數目、是否正確、依然不能無疑、現在先就小田東個人作個簡略的叙述、</p>
<p>小田東、是這次大秘密輸入手槍的主幹人、他本籍是盛岡縣、在盛岡商業學校讀書、十四歲時卽中途輟學、同他的伯父堀尾榮助、在神户經營火藥店、他曾因試騐火藥炸去右手的五個指頭、他在那家火藥店住了八年、因而領會得槍砲火藥的經營方法、到大正十三年（一九二四年）、他自已領得了經營槍砲火藥店的牌照、他卽在神户加納町開設了小田槍砲火藥店、那時候適當歐戰之後、德國的小手槍、自戰時殘留下來的、和生產過剩的、都很多、而且沒有銷路、小田看淸了來路、又利用他自已多年的訓練、與曾經特許的火藥店、就與當局者接洽、要實行大批輸入手槍、和其他軍械的分部、因此又得到非軍用品修械廠的牌照、那時候、他將從德國輸入來的槍砲子彈、都轉賣到天津·靑島·東三省·各地方去、因此他博得了巨利、擁有資財在百萬以上、於是他竟至利用往來於歐洲的郵船、後來祇帶些槍械的部分品等、到回來再行裝置、日本當局、也利用他這種營業、販槍到中國去、日可以容許、而且於牠的侵略是有利的、</p>
<p>殊不知這種圖利的經營、他本身唯一的目的是在乎圖利、所謂愛國的話、祗是表面上的說法、有大利可圖時、他就會犧牲愛國心、所以共產黨的武器、都可以從小田槍砲火藥店秘密購買、右傾團體、也是一樣、其賣價是、布朗林手槍每枝九十二圓日金、左輪一類的槍、則爲四十五圓、這樣秘密在日本境内賣出的、至少有三萬枝以上、子彈不下四十萬發、這自然要</p>
<p>更引起日本社會的不安、震撼政治界的秩序、這纔着手搜查、并將小田拘押起來、然而槍械已經散出去了、現在所搜得的、祇是擺在棧房裏的東西、而實際的困難、并不在這幾百枝已搜獲的槍上、（四月十三日於東京）</p>

<p>三年完成虬江碼頭、擬築於殷行區虬江口、計劃已久、且已測量完竣、自市府遷往市中心區後、市府對此碼頭之興建、尤爲積極、更經市中心區建設委員會决議、限期於三年内完成、市府前擬招商承辦、雖有應招前往接洽者、但均未成議、據記者探悉、中央銀行有投資承建之意、但尚未與市府接洽、故是否能成事實、亦尚未可知、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c188">釋疑—答許樂眞君— <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>我們接到許君與我們討論讀書問題的信已有幾次，對於他的不恥下問，孜孜好學的態度，早已感佩，但我們對於這封信却特别欣喜，爲的是，他不但肯信任我們，讀我們介紹給他的書，並且還能把書中的疑難很詳細地摘下，來和我們探討。這種不憚煩勞，不肯馬虎的求知精神，確是難能可貴，我們應該非常欽敬和效法的。所以，雖則他所半的書讀者們未必都要讀，他所不懂的名詞和句子或許讀者們都能了解，因此，看到這種討論或許會感到乏味，但是我們公佈這封信的主要的目的却並不是認爲這些問題應當提出討論，却是希望讀者能够摹做他這種求是的精神，精細的讀書，並能够這樣很具體地把書中的費解之處來和我們討論。如果將來這種樣子的來信增多，那末，我們將選擇其所讀的書確是一本好書又是一般的讀物，而所舉出的困難更爲一般讀者常會發生的，在報上發表，因爲這對於讀者，我們想來，也是很有益處的，其價値恐怕也不减於以前登載的讀書方法和某種問題的研究的探討罷。</p>
<p>現在我們將許君的問題逐一解答如下，但因篇幅關係，我們祗能很槪略地叙述；不過，假如是單獨答覆，或許是會詳盡一點的。</p>
<p>（一）我現在開始談辯證法唯物論敎程，但不知該書報吿應取什麽方式？</p>
<p>答··關於讀書報吿，我們將在下一期讀書消息裏詳細提出意見，現在暫且不說。</p>
<p>（二）「現實」與「實踐」二詞作何解，它們如何區别？</p>
<p>答··在這裏講的「現實」是有哲學上的意義的，它與「可能」這一個名詞相對立，所謂「可能」者，是指着這樣一種狀態，（正確地說，該是塲合二字）卽某種事物之存在或產生條件</p>
<p>業已具備，但我們却還不敢斷言其必然產生·但是如果這種「可能」實現了時，則就是「現實」了。故所謂「現實」者，是「可能」進展到「必然」後的一種塲合。至於「實踐」二字有「行動」的意見，它是與「理論」對立而又統一的。我們可以這樣說，「現實」指的是客觀環境，而「實踐」則爲我們變更客觀環境的行爲。</p>
<p>（三）何謂少數派？（原書第一頁）</p>
<p>答··少數派在這裏的意思，是指着俄國一切反對現在的社會主義建設路綫的主張者而言，這名詞是襲用了俄國舊日社會民主勞働黨中多數派與少數派的「少數派」而來的。少數派又名孟雪維克。</p>
<p>（四）何謂「意德沃羅基」？（第四頁）</p>
<p>答··「意德沃羅基」卽英名Ｉｄｅｏｌｏｇｙ之音譯，通常譯爲「意識形態」，又有人譯爲「思想系統」。卽「社會意識」（ＳｏｃｉａｉＣｏｎｓｃｉｅｎｃｅ）之意。所謂「社會意識」者，是指某個社會裏的人們對於世界和社會各種現象的情緒　觀點，槪念，和觀念等。這些觀點等系統化之後，鑄成功一個整個的觀念系統之後，於是就名之爲「意識形態」，科學，宗敎藝術等等都是的。但是」意識形態」如何產生出來的呢？這是因爲人們的意識是由社會生產底關係和條件决定的，它是現存底社會結論，生產關係的反映，所以社會上纔有系統的意識；因此生產條件一起變化，意識形態也隨之而變。在階級社會内，意識形態都是有階級性，超然於階級以外的意識形態是沒有的。這種解釋的根據，是··「客觀者物質存在决定思維。」</p>
<p>（五）「對於社會主義的「今日」的問題，都沒有實行必要的轉變。」這兩句話請更明顯的解釋一下。（同頁第九行）</p>
<p>答··這看了上下文就會明白。上文說過「實踐，爲理論的結論所支持，更加確實的前進。」又說過，「我們理論的思想必須與社會主義的實踐同着步調而進行」。因此，理論不應該停滯不進。這兩句話是說過去蘇聯的學術界（卽理論）對於處置目前的問題，還沒有從實踐中去研究，還是因襲舊說，而加以曲解。</p>
<p>（六）「應當從客觀的現實出發」作何解？（</p>
<p>第九頁三行）</p>
<p>答··這卽是「從實踐中去認識世界」的意思　　（七）「去征服盲目的必然」作何解？十三頁六行）</p>
<p>答··這句話又是承接上文的。上文的眉批上不是有過這樣兩句話嗎？「不單是說明世界，而必須改造世界」；上文不是說過嗎··「革命的變革客觀的實在，把必然性轉變爲自由。」所以，懂得了上文，也就懂得這句話的意思·你不懂此句，恐怕還是不懂「改造世界」的意義罷。現在就爲你淺釋如下；資本主義是必然要崩潰的，但如不加以人力的推動，是不會消滅的。所以我們應當「征服盲目的必然」。換句話說，以人力來改造現實，促進必然之從速實現。（未完）</p>

<p>— 德德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因此’我又不免　　在着那行車的鐵路員工擔心’也許這些火車的轉動’會有什麽使皇太后不滿意的地方’他們就得連帶送命了。只要這個老婦人隨便說一句很簡單的話’他們的腦袋便立刻可以吊下來了！</p>
<p>其時’我們的皇太后是眞像一個小孩子得到了一件新的玩具一樣。</p>
<p>在伊沒有走上這一列神秘的火車之前’伊决意要看一看它</p>
<p>畢竟是怎樣的一件東西？於是伊就命令抬轎的人把鸞輿歇下來’讓伊可以隨意的指揮’伊先敎火車慢慢地望前開去’火車動了’伊眞是萬分的歡喜；竟把伊自己的尊嚴也忘了’俯下了腰’儘瞧着那些在轉動的鐵輪出神’同時又連珠般的發出了無數的問句來。伊問··機關車裏怎麽會有蒸汽的呢？蒸汽是怎樣造出來的呢？究竟是什麽東西在推動這些輪盤？爲什麽火車不能在平地上走’必須在鐵軌上走呢？伊的神氣是完全變做一個小孩子了’誰也不會再想到伊是一個專制的女皇！</p>
<p>火車依着伊的命令向前’後退’向前’後退’一直到伊看得滿意了；似乎伊自己已經懂得火車是怎樣會行動的了’伊這才吩咐上車。</p>
<p>在伊所用的一輛車的前面’舖着一方像輪船上擱着的跳板一樣的木板’板上是覆着一條黃色的絲絨毯··李蓮英先走在伊的前面’扶着伊的手臂’兩旁另有許多太監用手夾護着她’以防傾跌’待伊跨上了車廂’這一方木板便立刻移去了。（一三）</p>

<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>要剷除封建勢力’須把舊有的封建遺物’漸漸的毁滅’因此蘇州的江蘇巡撫部院門前兩根旗杆也不能倖存了。言兩根旗杆’爲何時所立？無從查考。現在吳縣縣政府爲了留之無用’棄之可惜’便送給東吳大學。東吳大學本來想移過來用作國旗的標杆的。先雇工估計搬運的工程’那些工</p>
<p>匠’竟對着搖頭’因爲四五丈的高度’旣不能豎着拿’又不能橫着杠’後來只好截成三段’放在坍車上運送’把原有計畫抛去’改作别的用塲。大家都有一種感想’當時從山裏截下來’運進蘇州城’要費掉多少人工？封建時代的魄力’眞是可驚’當轉灣抹角時候’或者竟拆去民房’也未可知。</p>
<p>旗杆不僅是衙署的獨有物’廟宇門前</p>
<p>也有的’連科第人家也有的’相傳中了舉人’就得立一根旗杆。蘇州葑門内彭家’祖孫會狀’兄弟同榜’是科第最多的一家。因此他家門前’旗杆林立’至今旗杆雖已無存’夾輔旗杆的石柱’却還排列着’蘇州人就稱他家爲「旗杆裏」’這一類的旗杆’又充滿着科舉的臭味了。</p>
<p>說起旗杆’還有一點小掌故’那扯着巡撫部院的老旗杆’在辛亥九月十六日’扯過「江蘇都督府」和「興漢安民」的新旗呢。那麽這兩根旗杆’倒也是黨國元勛咧。呵呵！</p>

<p>無綫電話’如今是成爲高尚家庭’大商店中的必不可少的一種點綴品了。</p>
<p>商店中裝了一架收音機’雖然在這不景氣的年頭兒’也能吸引得門口常駐着幾位不買東西’而僅聽無綫電的掛名主顧。雖然這種情形’對於營業上是絕對不會發生一些好轉的影響的’但是說塲面’總比了櫃友們袖籠着手’伏在櫃上瞧雀兒在門口跳舞的强些。這是商店中裝置無綫電話的動機。</p>
<p>在家庭裏呢’老太太愛念佛的’在無綫電裏’可以聽到阿彌陀佛。少太太愛聽三笑姻緣’珍珠塔的’那麽’也可以在無綫電裏’聽到叮叮咚咚的彈唱着方卿唐伯虎。少奶奶别無所好’所好者惟蘇灘申曲’那麽’燃着一支烟捲兒’聽聽十八摸’小孤孀’有時撥得巧’來一下子桃花江’催眠曲’倒也是怪有味的。大小姐二小姐’三小姐’星期休息’各把甜心兒帶到家來’候着無綫電裏的爵士音樂’摟摟抱抱’得其所哉。這是高尚家庭中’少不了無綫電話的道理。　　無綫電話’風行一時’玩留聲機器’是落伍了。但在無綫電播音裏’却還有不少的唱片節目。雖然唱片已失時’但是在播音裏’依然是很受人歡迎’這倒也是怪有趣的一個現象。</p>

<p>出席遠東運動會之我國籃球選手、經四塲比賽之後、由選拔委員選出正式代表十二人、公佈如下、</p>
<p>唐堃賢張育才劉振元牟作雲李震中王玉增張景實尹鴻祥王錫良王湛若陳盛魁于敬孝</p>
<p>十二人中、京滬兩隊不獲一人、華北隊選上十人、僅劉學錡與王湛斌二人不入選、由湖北隊之陳盛魁于敬孝二人補充、查陳于二君、亦以前董守義指導下之華北名將也、</p>
<p>此次華北湖北上海南京四隊之全國籃球預選賽、業已竣事、南京兩戰兩北、上海勝京而敗於鄂、鄂則兩戰兩勝、最後却令治賽則敗於華北、</p>
<p>各隊實力、當以華北最强、蓋集名聞全國之平津好手合組者、亦爲全國人士所公認之出席遠東之理想代表、是以正式出席遠運代表、雖經預選、實則胸有成竹早經内定、今果不出所料、亦全國衆望之所歸者、</p>
<p>然而華北隊雖屬理想代表、未必均有入選資格、易言之、他隊中未必無一二出類拔萃之好手足以當選、出席預選之南京上海兩隊人員、技術雖屬平平、然未必預備員之資格俱無者、竟華北隊之預備員亦不如乎、</p>
<p>至於選拔方法、早經全國體恊會公佈、並一再聲明以個人技術爲標凖者、今證之所選代表、是否以個人爲標凖、抑以整個球隊爲禁凖、令人不解、</p>
<p>抑尤有進者、卽使以整個球隊爲選拔標凖、則預備員儘不妨在他隊中選入一二人、理正言順、亦人情之道、豈他隊中預備員之資格亦無乎、</p>
<p>湖北隊中之于敬孝、在四塲比賽中、一無可取、攻旣不足、守亦不取、較之同隊吳國霖、技術高下懸殊、今竟棄吳而取于、况吳勝其他正式代表尚多、南京之王士選、上海之陸鍾恩、亦足够預備員之資格、而王錫良王湛若之入選、實屬勉强、或曰、戰略不同、故而王陸之不能入選、此說於正式選手有關、而於預備員不生影響、况人在事爲、未必以一二預備員而致影響全隊、故王陸之入選、亦人之常情也、所謂標凖、所謂選拔、如此而已、</p>

<p>參加遠東籃球預選昨日華北湖北最後一塲却令治賽之結果、華北以七十二比三十五之鉅大比數、戰勝湖北、其間因比賽之傾於一面、局勢始終不見緊張、上半時華北隊有若干之巧妙表演外、下半時雙方皆以後備軍出戰、以致興味大减、以云精彩、不敢言也、觀衆則有二千人之譜、爲預選賽最盛之一次、</p>

<p>據黃氏談、關於大學校長、不得兼職一節、前蔣部長任内時、曾一度主張、時蔣氏卽將浙大一職、堅决辭去、蓋欲實行此項辦法、最近立法院修正通過之大學組織法第九條條文、其内容如何、本部尚未得覩、至謂大學校長不得兼職、究指何項職務、此時尚未明瞭、惟恐此次修正之條文、較以前所限制者、更爲嚴密耳、</p>

<p>敎育部前次派員視察浙江省敎育視察結果業經呈報敎部、茲將關於浙江敎育應行改進之意見探誌於左、</p>
<p>（一）該省轄區雖不遼闊、但省督學事務繁重、現有員額、未敷分派、自應酌量情形、設法增加、又大多數縣份、縣督學之視察、未能普遍、且有未設督學專職者、並應分别令飭酌量增添、</p>
<p>（二）地方敎育輔導會議、成績尚著、但少數縣學區輔導會議、其討論内容、尚嫌散漫、嗣後應再刻意改進、力求中心問題之研究、藉收實效、</p>
<p>（三）各縣所設學區敎育員者、因待遇菲薄能力參差、行政效能未能顯著者、應提高待遇、審愼人選、厲行考成、以期效率之增進、又各縣敎育委員會之設、用意良佳、但多數縣份、其工作尚嫌鬆懈、並應加意督促、以資策勵、</p>
<p>（四）省立各校中、尚有警官學校、自治專修學校、助產學校、水產學校、農業推廣人員養成所、及治蟲人員養成所等數校、因主管系統關係素不受該廳管轄設旋内容亦嫌參差、應由廳提案於省府會議會商各該主管行政機關、設法改進、並使受該廳之監督指導、以一事權、至水產科職業學校及其附設機關、尤應從速收歸該廳直接辦理、</p>
<p>（五）省敎育經費之數量、旣未能適合事實上之需要、而今後各種敎育事業之擴充、在在需費、應設法增籌以資補苴、</p>
<p>（六）省敎育經費業經獨立、嗣後省立敎育機關會計人員、應設法由廳直接派充、以重度支、</p>
<p>（七）各縣市敎育經費、除極少數縣份外、數量多嫌不足、辦理情形、亦頗紊亂、自應由廳會商民政財政二廳、酌量各縣情况、妥訂辦法、一面指定確實財源予以有效之介障、一面責成全體公務人員擔負整理之任、并組織特種機關、嚴督實施限期完成、</p>
<p>（八）各縣市免費學額、辦法參差、對於貧寒之弟之奬進、未能多所裨益、應由廳從速斟酌各地敎欵情形、令飭各縣設置奬學金、又省欵補助省立中等以上學校淸寒優良學生辦法、内容尚欠允當、並應由廳妥加修訂、</p>
<p>（九）省立醫藥專科學校、辦理尚切實際、但經費不敷分配、應設法酌予增加、以便充實研究實習室及科學醫療之設備、餘如專任敎員之增聘、藥科學額之擴充、學生程度之提高諸端、亦均應努力策進、</p>
<p>（十）歐美官費生缺額、待補者尚多、應參照部頒國外留學規程、妥訂選派辦法、定期考選合格學生、派往歐美留學、以宏人才之造就、其在留學期間内、呈送研究報吿及畢業後在本省服務之養務、尤當有確切之規定、</p>
<p>（十一）關於該省師範敎育及職業敎育之推進、業經本部另案辦理、餘如該廳所擬督促私立中等學校推進職業敎育辦法、在原則上尚稱切要、但具體實施之辦法、仍應參酌實情迅予擬訂、又推廣女子中等敎育辦法、核與實際需要、亦能適合、自屬可行、惟女子師範敎育以及適於女子職業之蠶桑編造紡織等科、尤應注意提倡、</p>
<p>（十二）縣市立聯立私立各中等學校、除少數尚有可觀外、辦理欠完善者、爲數不少、應嚴加考核、切實予以取締整頓、</p>
<p>（十三）中等學校校長敎員薪俸之標凖、核與當地生活、大抵尚屬相稱、惟縣市立私立中等學校初級中學敎員之最低標凖、尚嫌過於菲薄、應酌加增益、</p>
<p>（十四）各省立中學校舍、類多不敷應用、將來省敎費得有增加時、應由廳　衡　急、次第修葺建築省立杭州師範學校及省立湘湖鄕村師範學校校舍、尤當首先籌建、</p>
<p>（十五）各中等學校各科敎學設備、簡陋者多、亟應設法充實、以利敎學、至勞作科設備、亦多欠缺、並應隨時添置、力謀擴充、</p>
<p>（十六）一般中等學校課程内容充實、敎學精神亦稱振作、惟少數學校、實騐實習未甚得法、敎學用語尚操地方方言、敎學效率爲之减退、應卽切實改進、</p>
<p>（十七）中小學體育之訓練、鮮著成效、健設備身、多嫌不足、應迅予妥訂辦法、加緊實施、尤須依據全國體育會議之建議、對於必要設備、分期添置、</p>
<p>（十八）各縣市小學數量、未敷需要、鄕僻之區更甚、亟應儘量添設、以期義務敎育之推進、尤須利用私塾改作短期義務小學、以資救濟、</p>
<p>（十九）各縣市區立小學之中、規模狹小學額欠足、設施内容未能適合者、不在少數、應由敎局設法通盤計劃、務使聘合鄰區、共同設置規模較大班數較多之完善學校、以增效率、</p>
<p>（二十）行複式及單級敎學法之小學、於各組活動之支配、每欠洽當、應由輔導機關加意研究、認眞輔導、</p>
<p>（二十一）民衆學校之推進、頗具相當成績、惟民衆敎育館之事業、尚多偏重形式之舖張、其輔導社會敎育之效率、亦多未能盡量發揮、亟應設法改進、俾收良果、</p>
<p>（二十二）廓淸文盲、指導民衆體育之工作、尚未著效、嗣後均應分别妥訂實施計劃、嚴督進行、</p>

<h3 id="c228">小說之隨筆化 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>現在中國文壇有一個現象是値得注意的。那就是小說之隨筆化。這好像是同近來的幽默小品’心境隨筆之發達’相連繫着的。並且這與現在中國的社會環境有關。生活的空虚’使人傾向於「容易的文學」（Ia　IitteratureFａｃｉｌｅ。）</p>
<p>隨筆式的小說’比嚴正的小說好作的多。避難就易’作隨筆式的小說’是暴露着作家的創作態度之欠嚴肅與生活之欠充實。</p>
<p>有一個編雜誌的朋友吿訴我說··「近來有些東西簡直分不出是小說還是散文」。可見這種傾向是在日日滋長着’越來越顯著。</p>
<p>我以爲小說與隨筆是文學上的不同種類的樣式’其間是有着嚴正的區别的。</p>
<p>哈密爾頓一流的小說研究家說’小說須具有結構’人物’背景等等的要素。英國是近代工業資本主義的先進國’小說的樣式’在英國發達最早。李却生’費爾定給小說規定了很多的條件。那麽’反乎小說的條件的’無結構’人物’背景諸條件的東西’便可以稱之爲隨筆或散文。</p>
<p>若就其發生的社會基礎上說’小說是向上的市民層的產物’而散文隨筆則是貴族或士大夫層的產物。小說有結構’有事件的轉折’故事的展開’而散文則是閑逸而散漫的’在大部分的塲合近於詩’是詩之散文代。</p>
<p>這自然是指先世紀以前的小說而言；到了十九世紀末季’在唯美主義’印象主義’象徵主義一對於現實主義之反動一的空氣中’作家大部分離開現實對於la　betisehumainei不敢正視的時候’有些小說抛棄了社會表現的任務’於是小說之散文隨筆化的傾向’日趨發達了。法朗士的大部份作品卽其一例。</p>
<p>小說之散文隨筆化這種傾向’大體上說’總不是向上的傾向。這裏含着一種危機。巨匠安得烈’紀得（A·Gide）是一位藝術的良心的最强的人’是一位追求欲最烈的人’在他的許多小說作品中’他只承認「造假錢的人羣」是一篇正格的長篇小說（roman）。其卓識遠慮’槪可想見。當隨筆散文侵入小說園地的時節’我們的作家們是不是要爲「小說之防禦」而努力呢？我們是不是要保障小說樣式之獨立呢？</p>
<p>我以爲這種小說之隨筆化底傾向’我們是須特别注意的。「容易的文學」之發達’我們是須時時加以防止的。一方面’我們作家須創造新的更進一步的小說樣式’而他方面’是要時時刻刻防禦着小說之隨筆化底這個危機。</p>

<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>（遊西天目）</p>
<p>三月三十日’星期五’陰晴。　　西天目山’屬於潛縣。昨天在地名藻溪的那個小站下車’坐轎向北行三四十里’中途曾過一敎口嶺’高峻可一二十丈。過敎口嶺後’四面的樣子就不同了。嶺外是小山荒田的世界’落寞不堪；嶺内向北’天目高高’就在面前’路旁流水淸滄’自然是天目山南麓流下來的雙淸谿澗’或合或離’時與路會’村落很多’田也肥潤’橋梁路亭之多’更不必說了。經過白鶴溪上的白鶴橋’月亮橋後’路只在一段一段的斜高上去。入大有村後’已上山路’天色陰陰’樹林暗密’一到山門’在這夜陰與樹影互競的黑暗網裏’速遠聽到了幾聲鐘鼓梵唱的催眠暗示’一種長怖’寂滅’皈依’出世的感覺’忽如雷電似的向腦門裏襲來。宗敎的神秘作用’奇蹟的可能性’我們在這裏便領略了一個飽滿’一半原係時間已垂暮的關係’一半我想也因一天遊旅倦了’筋骨氣分’都已有點酥懈了的緣故。</p>
<p>西天目的開山始祖’是元嘉熙年生下來的吳江人高峯禪師。修行坐道處’爲西峯之獅子巖頭’到現在西天目還有一處名死關的修道處’就係高峯禪　師當時榜門之號。禪師的骨塔’現在獅子峯下的獅子口裏。自元歷明’西天目的道塲廟宇’全係建築在半山的這獅子峯附近一帶的所謂師子正宗禪寺者是。元以前’西天目山名不確見於經傳’東坡行縣’也不曾到此’謝太傳遊山’屐痕也不曾印及。元明兩代’寺屢廢屢興’直至淸康熙年間’玉林國師始在現在的禪源寺基建高峯道塲’實卽元洪喬祖施田而建之變淸莊遺址。　　在陰森森的夜色裏’轎子到了山門；下轎來一看’只看見一座規模浩大的八字黃牆’牆内牆外’木架橫斜’這天目靈山的山門似正在動工修理。入門走一二里’地高一段’進天王殿；再高一段’入韋駄寶殿；又高一段’是有一塊「行道」的匾額掛在那裏的法堂。從此一段一段’高而再高’過大雄寳殿’穿方丈居室’曲折旋繞’凡走了十幾分鐘’纔到了東面那間五開間的樓廳上客堂裏。窗明几凈’燈亮房深’陳設器具’却像是上海灘上的頭號旅館’只少了幾盞電燈’和賣唱賣身的幾個優婆夷耳。</p>
<p>正是舊歷的二月半晚上’一餐很舒適的素菜夜飯吃後’雲破月來’迴廊上看得出寺前寺後的許多靑峯黑影’及一條怪石很多的曲折的山溪。溪聲鏗鏘’月色糢糊’剛讀完了第二十八回野叟嚗言的語堂在師’含着雪茄’上迴廊去背手一望’回到爐邊’就大呌了起來··　　這眞是絕好的Ｄｉｃｈｆｕｎｇ！　　可惜山腰雪滿’外面的空氣尖冷’我們對了這一個淸虚夜境’只能割愛；吃了些從天王殿的攤販處買來的花生米和具有異味的土老酒後’幾個Ｄｉｃｈｔｅｒ也只好抱着委屈各自上床去做夢了。</p>
<p>侵晨七點’詩人們的夢就爲山鳥的淸唱所打破’大家起來梳洗早餐後’便預備着坐轎上山去遊山。語堂受了一點寒’不願行動’只想在禪源寺的僧榻上臥讀野叟曝言’所以不去。</p>

<p>— 伊人</p>
<p>這是在一九二八年深秋的一天’我在杭州害過了一塲大瘧疾’便不得不失望地回到武漢去；經過上海的時候’因爲允諾借二十塊錢給我的一位朋友臨時爽了約’我便不得不坐統艙。</p>
<p>黃昏時候’復下着凄淸的細雨’送我上船的只是我底唯一老友谷城。因爲在外國輪船上要少些打半票的丘八以及其它的糾紛發生’比較來得淸爽些’所以我便上了ＸＸ公司底輪船’統艙裏恰恰剩下了一個上層的舖位’我便把它定下了。我在舖着牀時’谷城復從岸上買來一大串香蕉；在我底牀底下層的客人是一個少女和一個四十來歲的婦人’她們聽得我們談話是湖南口音’便以湖北口音開始和我們攀同鄕—說湖南湖北是一家。谷城恐我一個人在船上太孤寂’也樂得和她們攀談幾句’我們談着’吃着香蕉地混了一些時候’谷城便辭别上岸去了··我站在船門口目送着谷城底黑影從濛濛的雨中消逝’心中很覺惘惘；回到艙中’隨後便一覺睡了。</p>
<p>一覺醒來’船已進了長江好遠了。雖然天亮還不久’我却已有些餓意；洗過臉吃過牛乳’仍覺無聊’便走到船邊去看風景。風景沒有什麽可看的；可是’我再回到艙中’却找到了對於我有一種新奇興趣的東西了··睡在我底牀下層的兩個湖北女人把我底墊毯展開大半邊從牀緣懸下—好像是當作着帳子一般；遮着在裏面的’是橫躺着她們兩個女人在抽鴉片烟。抽鴉片烟並沒有什麽稀奇；可是她們做泡的技術’她們底手的活潑靈巧’確使我佩羡而感到賞鑑的興趣··那少女底左手拿着一個銅元’右手拈着一根光光的鐵針；她用那光光的鐵針向一個小小鴉片盒裏一挑’不多不少的鴉片膏恰恰粘在那光光的針上面；於是很活潑地一邊向燈上燒着’一邊向銅元上轉着；燒時能使它不至燒燃’轉時能使它不至粘上銅元··她這樣的技術’已使我十分心佩了。接着我再看那婦人底技術却更高··她在燈上燒時’恰恰在欲燃而止’欲滴而掄；在銅元上轉時’一轉便十分圓澈’操縱自如’無不恰到好處　　他們過足了癮’熄了燈’向我道了歉’將我底墊毯仍復墊好時；我却仍興趣正濃地覺得鑑賞未足。於是我便向别處去找抽鴉片烟的看。（未完）</p>

<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>在荒山曠野中行走’有時是需要一點曲懞憧；如果太常常敏感了’倒反而更要痛苦些。這不是偶然心血來潮的感想’却是我先前旅行於高黎貢山中’留下來的經騐。</p>
<p>記得那一天的山路’是沿着一條曲折的山澗的。澗邊路旁’樹木蓬生’抬起頭望’天光雲影’頗不容易窺出。沿途只見奔流的溪水’常從轉折的叢莽處’迎面鑽了出來’碰在嶙峋的石上’濺着珠花’孩子似地笑着跳着’打我身邊衝下坡去。有些時候’山路却又蜿蜒到溪溝那面’便不得不踏着水中挺露的大石’走了過去。甚至這樣的情形’也是有的··突然間山路溪水’彷彿全沒有了’立在面前的’只有高聳的危巖和稠密的林叢；然而’一從崖上的小徑’爬了過去’轉眼之際’先前的景象’又都展露出來。這樣的旅途’就是整天地走着’我想’大約誰也不會感到一些厭倦吧？</p>
<p>約莫將近走完這條山路的時候’驀地遇見對面來了一人’手裏是提着一把長刀的’便把我馬上嚇呆了’一路吹着的口哨兒’立卽停止’靜靜地屏着呼吸。但他却是神色驚惶地走了過來’瞧我一眼’又怱怱地走了過去。我大大喘了一口氣’細看他繫在背上的小竹筐’裝着的原是一些馬鈴薯和果實’才知道他並非「賊爺爺」’不過一個過路的農人罷了’提刀而行’目的僅在保衛自己。到這時我始明白’這條山路大槪是不甚安全的。然而也可說’許是那人太神經過敏了吧？總之’我一開始就不曾敏感着「會碰見賊爺爺」’而只是懞里懞懂地前進着’無論如何’這算是有福的了。卽使中途被人突然一刀斷送性命’也要比一路膽戰心驚而遭不幸的來得舒適痛快些。</p>
<p>因此’倘若在人生的旅程上’坦然前進’而要少受些苦痛的話’那末’我以爲也應該像走在荒山曠野一樣’有時是必須一點懞懂的。</p>

<p>「眞是這樣的’在家千日好’唉····」沉默了一會’他垂下頭嘆氣了’於是拿屁股抵住牆’搖了兩下手臂’彷彿自白一般’開始混亂而夾雜地訴說起他流浪中的艱苦和他的妻兒來’他把他們留在故鄕的小屋裏’而現在是音息皆無了。他的叙述不時爲酒呃所打斷’而且還接二連三地反問着··</p>
<p>「你說呢？」</p>
<p>「唔’唔····」在好多次的追問之後’她不得已地應聲了’一面縮躡地望衖堂里面退去。　　「呀’一個啞子？」那漢子吃驚地追問’他接着又用那一面在心里轉念頭的聲調嚷道··　　「眞的是啞子？」</p>
<p>「唔····」她已經隱沒在暗影中了’而來人却依舊站在原處’一隻眼睛瞄着路燈’手搔着突出的下巴上的鬍鬚。在一忽的沉思中’他用一種爲寂寞所苦的感情嘆息道··</p>
<p>「眞沒法子····」接着’他從她隱沒的處所跟去了’而到了次一天的早晨’才揉着眼睛離開那人類的巢穴。但此後却不時地來拜訪了’爲了一點冷飯或零錢’一直到被那孀婦發現了他們的秘密。這大漢子婦人’兩支手插在絨線背心的口袋裏’彷彿一個剛才生了蛋的鷄婆一樣’「死泥鍬也有餓老鴉呀！」她笑嚷着’跑遍了每一家的灶間’而且在已經集合起來的人衆前提出她聰明的推測··</p>
<p>「要是她勾上小偷呢？」</p>
<p>「呀’難怪我前回掉了兩塊水布！」一個滿臉雀瘢的女人搗着鍋鏟驚呌了。接着大家也都神經過敏起來’而一個驅逐的提議’馬上便在主人們嫌惡和擔心的感情裏通過了。於是就在這天早上’她不得不收拾起她所有的財產’（這簡陋得恰像是對於我們的法律的一點諷刺··因爲她只有一只破碗’和一般魚網般的棉絮。）離開了這個衖堂’用她那一個人在衖道上彳亍的步調’在人們的嘲笑當中’在那大公無私的陽光下面’·····（完）</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>日本國之外交手段’眞所謂花樣翻新’無奇不有。先則用親善之假面具’來蒙蔽各國之耳目’無中生有’淆亂聽聞。繼則以鄙卑之行爲’來向各國疎通’甜言密語’極盡鼓吹之能事。更則暴露其獰惡面目’實行其斷然手段’卑劣齷齪莫過於此！</p>
<p>日來’彼等世界戲劇之導演者’又在掀風作浪’推波助瀾’以擴大其演出之塲面’喜劇’悲劇’吾人當拭目一觀之。然則’彼等終在劍拔弩張’雙管齊下之運用其靈敏奸詐之政治外交手段。趁此各國軍政紛亂之機會’一方面在圖謀永久侵略整個華北計劃之進行’一方面則竭力緩和蘇俄方面之空氣’及擬聯絡美國；並從中作梗’使美俄復交破裂。但此項計劃終吿失敗’陰謀手段亦無從進行’祗得徒呼負負而已。然’孰知其不將變更策略’以促其夢想之實現耶？</p>
<p>前次’日本之煽動菲洲獨立’亦爲其陰巧微妙之外交方式之一種’而不久亦吿失敗。惟其始終抱定「失敗是成功之母」之决心；是以’雖屢吿失敗’亦並不因此而氣餒’再接再厲’又欲饜足其野心而後已。以故’邇來彼等已實行外交總動員’向世界各國’游說’拉攏’破壞’活動’無微不至’無孔不入。其鬼計多端’醜態畢露’誠可憐亦復可恨！四月’各報載··二日華聯社電訊’「菲洲東北部之黑人國’亞比西呢亞王族’欲娶日婦候補皇妃’已定爲黑田子爵二女政子女士’此政策與川島芳子嫁蒙王同工異曲’日軍政方面對此期待甚大。因好事多磨’美人計功敗垂成’日稱意國暗中阻止此好事’亞比西呢亞外長不得已取銷此婚約云」觀乎此’卽知日人之陰謀詭計’到處昭然若揭’固毌待贅言。然嘗憶曩年川島芳子之獻與蒙王’亦卽此同樣之手段’而孰知此次之計劃’竟爲意大利從中作梗’致使其「美人計」功敗垂成’其啣恨於意國之刺骨切齒’固可想見矣。</p>
<p>日前報載··日本運大批植物赴美’其中暗藏多量激烈毒素’後爲美國當局察出’遂加扣留’始未爲其奸計所逞。然其居心之陰險酷毒’於此可見一斑也。</p>
<p>東北傀儡溥儀’在所謂「滿洲國」登極後’日方卽進獻日本美女若干人’以供娛樂’藉慰枯寂’其愛護之忱’眞是體貼入微。但’吾人試細味其用意固何在哉；善意乎’抑係另有作用歟？吾人不難一索其底藴。蓋其利用美色淫樂以監視溥儀之行動’使其不致越雷池一步耳。其用心之深遠’設想之週密’豈吾渾渾噩噩之國人所能望望塵及之乎！噫吁！</p>

<p>端的不會死’那就來幹一幕自殺的把戲’他們（或她們）都認自殺是唯一的歸宿’唯有自殺才能解决自身的一切。</p>
<p>近一月來校裏竟繼續地閙了幾件自殺的慘案··</p>
<p>某一個雨天的晚上’舍監上寢室點名’在某號宿舍裏失踪了×女士’一直到第二天晚飯的時分才在訓育室旋發見了她的遺書’大致是這樣寫的··</p>
<p>「···生着旣找不到人生的樂趣’還生苦味的人了’所以還是投身於茫茫無際的大海裏’隨着怒濤奔騰的浪花去吧。啊！世界是一個極大舞臺’任何人都是其中取一個角色’我演了一幕悲劇’我就首先下台；對於人生’對於戀愛’對於金錢’這始終是幾個不可解决的謎’呵！謎呀’戀愛的味兒我已嘗試過了’而且嘗試過了幾次’不過我是失敗了’它們的滋味是苦的’是辣的····永决了’我的師’我的友····」</p>
<p>由此我們知道她是去自殺了’並且推知一定是投海或黃浦自殺的。因此學校裏同學之間又多了一種新的談話資料了。有幾個偵探般的以喜管閒事聞名的同學吿訴我是這樣的一回事··</p>
<p>「×女士在門房裏給了三元錢’所以門房就給她不請假出門了····」</p>
<p>聽到了門房私下拿錢的話’不覺我的心頭起了一些無名的反感’所以我不讓同學說下去就首先搶着高聲的說··「哩！門房私下拿錢這算得什麽一回事’×同學不是親口吿訴我說她會要出口方便而給了門房二元錢的嗎’還有××要出去看電影也給了它六毛錢嗎？哩！諸如此類的事不知有幾多呢？」</p>
<p>「是囉！校役祗想「揩油」私下拿錢私偷嬾’學校以收入學費爲事’其他的一切不問不置’學生約會看影戲閙戀愛’置功課於腦後’呵！這樣的是大學裏的敎授學生和校工的生活！不過現在我將某女士的事再講給你聽！據說×女士曾戀愛過了三個異性’可是她終因爲自己虚榮心的難以滿足而遺棄了人’自討苦吃’到了現在的地步。」</p>
<p>由×女士的慘劇裏也足以很明顯地暴露了這時代靑年内在的矛盾’啊！矛盾’人偏是在這樣矛盾中生活着。</p>

<p>少奶奶心裏覺得嫁了這種夫婿’不去賺錢揚名顯親’弄到父母憎惡’未免傷心’一陣鼻子酸溜溜眼眶裏頭涙兒在汜濫着。</p>

<p>— 蘭蕪</p>
<p>記得有一張似乎呌做「英倫艶史」的，（？）他一開幕就是極濃的朝霧，人們在迷霧中行動＊</p>
<p>。迷霧是倫敦的特色，說明這張影片是以倫敦做背景的。但是他接着出現的是倫敦街道上的＊</p>
<p>舊式的車輛’這在說明倫敦之外，更說明英人保守的性格。而在迷霧中，他只出現着極少數＊</p>
<p>的行人和汽車，只是聽到送牛乳車的鈴聲，漫漫的自遠而近，又慢慢的遠了。這樣使觀衆陶＊</p>
<p>醉於街頭朝霧的詩的空氣中。至於拿戰爭爲背景的自然更可以描得風聲鶴唳的戰爭的空氣。＊</p>
<p>而不必待眞的戰爭出現。卽使戰爭影片，那末，戰爭的恐怖空氣，决不在於轟天的大砲聲，＊</p>
<p>和連珠似的機關槍聲中，反而在大戰時，或則終了以後的受傷的馬的哀嘶。</p>
<p>中國電影要做成農邨的和平空氣，常常拿柳塘鵝樂來表現，這自然可以的。但是我覺假＊</p>
<p>使能够攝一個佳穀滿田的平疇的遠景，接着一個一輛牛車滿載而歸的近景；特别注意的是輝＊</p>
<p>煌的落日餘光，照在牛車載滿佳穀的一邊。更接着一個趕牛車的農夫的頭部特寫；太陽光塗＊</p>
<p>滿着草帽的微笑。更接着一個遠景是小村莊的依依炊烟，一條路上，牛車漸走漸遠，終於＊</p>
<p>「淡入」。假使是有聲片，那末在第一個遠時，田歌聲自遠而近，第二個近景歌聲更大一點，＊</p>
<p>第三特寫，唱歌。第四個遠景歌聲再自近而遠，這樣就不是「無目的對於自由界的唯美主義＊</p>
<p>的欣賞」而把「自然界和牠的週圍的人物混合起來」（Ｇ湼拉陀夫序「鐵流」）這較之柳塘鵝樂，＊</p>
<p>不知有力多少？我們假使要加强電影的效果，影片的空氣，是値得注意的。</p>
<p>和空氣相似而實際上不同的，就是所謂地方色彩了。上邊所說的「英倫艶史」的濃霧，就＊</p>
<p>是表示倫敦的地主色彩。而「伏虎美人」中的，豹，一方面原可以表現女王的威力，一方面也＊</p>
<p>可以表現撤哈拉的地方色彩。至於名片「金山」中一個女人的以葵花子，那更表示出高加索一＊</p>
<p>帶的地方色彩了。</p>
<p>中國電影的作才者，要使觀衆知道這一個故事發生的所在地，較高明一點，像拿沙遜大厦＊</p>
<p>等來表示上海，天壇等來表示北平，更拙劣一點的，只有用字幕來說明了，這樣效果是極少。＊</p>
<p>極少的。</p>
<p>無論如何，形式總是内容决定的，創作方法，是一切藝術的基本。「自然界只是人物的＊</p>
<p>一個鏡框子一，「自然界並不是死的，完全不是冷淡的」；「自然界有時候是牧歌的詩境似的冲＊</p>
<p>淡和親愛，有時候又像雷電似的可怕」；「自然丨丨這是一種力量，直接參加大小事變的力＊</p>
<p>量，是不疲倦的證人，善良的朋友，或則兇惡的仇敵」。（Ｇ湼拉陀夫序「鐵流」）所以要借着＊</p>
<p>自然界表示出地方色彩，我們也應該把自然界的動態表現出來，「英倫艶史」的濃霧，是非常＊</p>
<p>適當的配合着牛乳車的鈴聲而織成「詩境似的朦朧」。只是生硬的介紹天壇或沙遜大厦，是沒＊</p>
<p>有用的。何况「英倫艶史」的濃霧，和劇情還有關係，在濃霧中看到一個女人不很晰，因而＊</p>
<p>誤會。「金山」中的女人的吃葵花子，除了表示出地方色彩以外，更表示出他們當時的閒逸心＊</p>
<p>情「付虎美人」中，豺的表示威力，更不用說了。</p>
<p>至於同一「存在」，因爲表現方法不同而成兩種完全不同的空氣，更有例可舉。「金山」的＊</p>
<p>烟突的畫面，因爲鏡頭離烟突近，更攝有濃烟，就使觀衆感到工廠的偉大和可怖。國片「壓＊</p>
<p>迫」中的烟突，因爲鏡頭離得遠，帶及工廠屋頂更因爲要表示工廠停工而沒有烟，就使人有＊</p>
<p>一張風景畫的感覺，我想假使這一個鏡頭，離得近一點，在畫面上是一個烟突的上半截的特＊</p>
<p>寫，我想觀衆們，就不會有風景畫面的感覺了。</p>
<p>藝術家們，給自然界與生命罷，只有這樣纔能够完成空氣和地方色彩的最好的效果。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c258">評「春戀」　Ｔｈｅ　Ｓｏｎｇ　Ｙｏｕ　Ｇａｖｅ　Ｍｅ　一國泰一 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 亞夫</p>
<p>一看了「春戀」的題名’使我想起日前自由談上的漫畫「春遊」’一笑’</p>
<p>戀愛’戀愛’徹頭徹尾的戀、愛’徹頭徹尾的羅曼斯。還帶一點傷感的情調。也許’在情塲失意高貴的人們’將因其以輕鬆的手法所寫的Ｓｅｎｔｍｅｎｔ而感動’然而這又何嘗不是笑話。</p>
<p>因爲劇作者要寫一個所謂可愛的羅曼斯’於是他聰明的寫了這一個銀幕的男女糾紛。的確’這裏充分的運用了電影所特用的表現技術’（如琵琵妲妮兒在門後裝扮假與别人接吻等）使這一羅曼斯非常生動而有趣。反之’在文學上無論如何是不能如此充分表現的了。技巧始終是由於内容所决定的’羅曼斯到　有羅曼斯獨持的技巧。</p>
<p>再說’每一個演員都適當的使這羅曼斯掙扎着存在。這不僅是琵琵妲妮兒盡了最大的責任’就連那飾捧角客的三人’也給導演支配得十分活潑有趣了。所以’從各方面來看’這「春戀」並不在Ｒｏｆｎａｎｉｓｍ的影片中央却它的地位’而且是新型’這在英美影片中不可常見。　　　　。有人給它感動了之後’而否認它是羅曼斯的時候’那末我們祇要在歌女不嫁給包圍在她周圍的人們’而獨和那相當窮酸的歌劇家結合’這一點便是劇作者之最大的幻想。然而在此’便說明劇者之傷感的來由’他同情那鼎鼎大名之歌女的遭遇’他以爲天下之大’只有那個未成名的音樂家才是眞正愛她的’而且是了解她的。</p>
<p>在目前’有少許人認爲電影是「軟性藝術」’這一名詞運用得十分奇妙’據解釋因爲膠片便是軟的；所以影片可以毫無意識。那末我以爲這一「春戀」應當最適合他們口味的了。</p>
<p>最後’我以爲劇中的木人戲’倒是很値得我們看看的’爲了戲劇的研究’我們不妨學習一下。至於這種影片在風雲滿天的目前’它將在觀衆中間取得什麽作用呢？那我想是不用多說了。</p>

<p>有人看了「體育皇后」，以爲它的主＊</p>
<p>張打破運動界的錦標制度，針砭體育皇＊</p>
<p>后的金冠是很好的，首先，這位先生不＊</p>
<p>懂得錦標制度的所以存在，實有其深邃＊</p>
<p>的社會原因。敎育的商品化，使運動兢＊</p>
<p>賽變成商品的商標，用以號召他們的主＊</p>
<p>顧，於是不得不有錦標制度來鼓勵一輩＊</p>
<p>勇士們。近代社會的種種腐敗墮落的現＊</p>
<p>象，經濟破產，政治黑暗的事實，擺在＊</p>
<p>學生前面，搖動了他們中間大多數的心＊</p>
<p>，頭腦比較淸楚的，對於這種現狀自然＊</p>
<p>非常不滿，於是這種學生被人們厭惡，＊</p>
<p>而用許多方法來擾亂學生們的目光，「＊</p>
<p>體育」便是其中之一，用錦標制來加强＊</p>
<p>體育的刺激力，更容易的去完成現在的＊</p>
<p>「體育」的任務。而别一方面，錦標制度＊</p>
<p>的本身是無可非議的，但是因爲錦標制＊</p>
<p>度是用在現在的敎育制度上，這種敎育＊</p>
<p>制度根本上是反進步的，所以一般的浮＊</p>
<p>面的觀察者，總認爲錦標制度是應該打＊</p>
<p>破，反而忘記了現在的體育敎育的反進＊</p>
<p>步的本質了。</p>
<p>這位先生是不知道這一點的，而且＊</p>
<p>，他也沒有看到「體育皇后」的作者想說＊</p>
<p>而不敢明白說的一點。在世界大戰爆發＊</p>
<p>的時候，各國的民衆被什麽「光榮」欺騙＊</p>
<p>住了，白白的犧牲，正像秋華那樣的犧＊</p>
<p>牲在運動塲裏一樣，在第二次世界大戰＊</p>
<p>的前夕，我們是應該認識到所謂「光榮」＊</p>
<p>對於民衆是無關的，民衆是不應該再白＊</p>
<p>白的犧牲了，在民衆的面前是奮鬥與前＊</p>

The remaining bandits are scattered and fleeing, and their annihilation is imminent. He hoped that all committee members would arrive at the temple soon to attend the political conference's founding meeting on the 23rd.

<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram, 16th: Fu Zuoyi has resolved to thoroughly eliminate the small bandit forces of Yang Hou that fled to the Mongolian border to the east. After returning to Suiyuan, he immediately decided on a detailed encirclement and suppression plan, ordering infantry, cavalry, and artillery units to advance double-time from San Sheng Gong towards Wuchuan. According to reports from the front lines, the encirclement and suppression arrangements have been successfully completed. As a result of continuous suppression over the past few days, the bandits have scattered and fled in different directions, and Bailing Temple has also been secured by troops dispatched from here, ensuring there is no danger. Since Fu believes that bandit suppression is no longer a problem, he is scheduled to go to Baotou on the morning of the 17th to handle unfinished matters regarding the reorganization of Sun's troops. Furthermore, because the Mongolian Autonomous Committee has decided to hold its founding assembly at Bailing Temple on the 23rd, he is sincerely afraid that committee members, not understanding the true situation, will hesitate to attend. Therefore, he specially telegraphed all committee members to report the bandit suppression situation, hoping they will arrive at the temple immediately to ensure the opening ceremony proceeds as scheduled. The original text roughly stated: "The small bandit forces of Yang Hou, who recently fled to the vicinity of Beile Temple, have been under intense suppression by dispatched troops in recent days. The remaining bandits are scattered and fleeing. The Mongolian Political Committee is scheduled to hold its founding assembly at Beile Temple on the 23rd. Promoting Mongolian political development from this point forward is extremely important. At the beginning of this founding, we earnestly hope that it will be held as scheduled to meet the expectations of the Mongolian people and establish great confidence. The small bandit forces of Yang Hou are being encircled and annihilated by our troops, and the time of their collapse is believed to be not far off. We sincerely hope that all gentlemen will arrive at the temple on the scheduled date to ensure a successful event. In the unlikely event that the bandit forces cause disturbances at that time, we will dispatch troops to escort them to the temple, ensuring a successful event."

<h3 id="e27">Northwest Border Defense and Development <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Kang-Tibetan dispute rises and falls intermittently. The reason for its instability is the lack of proactive measures. One reason is the remoteness of the region and obstructed transportation. Responsible officials are content with temporary peace and hold a complacent attitude of muddling through. Another reason is that Tibetans lack a fully organized structure, and the instigators do not have a rapid and sweeping ambition for Kang and Tibet. Therefore, they delay and prevaricate, covering up the current crisis. Now that the Dalai Lama has passed away, all political and religious affairs in Tibet have fallen into a state of stagnation. The Panchen Lama is also residing in the southeast and cannot easily return to the west for the time being. Thus, Tibet lacks a strong political and religious leader, and it is difficult to immediately determine its eastern encroachment conspiracy and its tendency to obey the central government. Therefore, the act of sending troops to invade is likely just a temporary riot and not a true indication of war. Recently, Liu Wenhui has reached an agreement with the local Tibetans to restore the Da Jin Temple. If we handle this properly, the majority of Tibetans will be inclined to us. The few cunning individuals will then be easily governed according to the law or influenced by virtue.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Dalai Lama seems to have realized that relying on Britain is not a long-term solution and has a sincere desire to be aligned with the central government. It is a pity that his wishes were not fully realized and the Panchen Lama has not returned to Tibet. The Kang-Tibetan dispute has thus been delayed and unresolved. If the authorities in Xikang could rise up in time, rectify official corruption on the one hand and strengthen military preparedness on the other, abandon the long-standing evil habit of internal strife in Sichuan Province, and reform themselves to plan for the entire border defense, even if Xikang alone is not enough to speak of national defense, it would be sufficient to appease the Tibetans and eliminate the undesirable elements. The worrying thing is that Xikang's resources are still completely buried in the ground and have not been developed at all. In the shortest possible time, it is also restricted by domestic capital and transportation, making it difficult to implement development. It is insufficient to rely solely on a small number of manual labor to maintain the stability of the vast border area. Moreover, at a time when powerful nations are watching us, there are many constraints, making it even more difficult to deal with. Furthermore, Qinghai and Xinjiang, which border Kang and Tibet to the north, are also experiencing many troubles. The impact of Han-Hui conflicts on the inland is still small, but it is very serious for Tibet. What is even more difficult is that Sichuan has been plagued by years of civil war, with warlords hating and deceiving each other, which has almost become an open secret. If this is not thoroughly eliminated, it will easily incite the alienation of distant people and cause internal chaos. Therefore, without an overall plan and concrete guidance, there is no hope of success. Agriculture in Xikang has not yet been fully developed today, while Qinghai is still in the pastoral era. It is very difficult to achieve coordinated cooperation. With the economy in the same predicament as the interior and the political situation unable to have immediate bright prospects, this is truly the most thorny issue.</p>
<p>So, where is the so-called overall plan? I say it lies in practical development. If this development plan is not carried out earnestly, I fear that time will not wait for us. The coveting of our western neighbor has been going on for more than a day. The actual actions of the struggle in Central Asia are no less intense than the naval competition in the Pacific Ocean. The position of our country is exactly the same. If our country can first establish a minimal level of clean government in Xikang and Qinghai, and make the people aware of their national identity so that they do not fall into the mire, then Tibet may long serve as a barrier and be a loyal member of the Republic of China. As for Xinjiang, disputes have been going on for a long time, and verbal persuasion or a written warning are difficult to achieve results. Judging from the current situation, the resolution of the Xinjiang dispute may require the use of military force for a distant expedition. However, the realization of this kind of remote enterprise is also very difficult. But besides this, what other method will there be to maintain the northwest and establish the foundation for national rejuvenation?</p>
<p>The Hetao area, which is the foundation for border defense in Xinjiang and the far north, has always been in a very important position in the past. Now that the PingSui Railway has opened and Inner Mongolia is in a very critical state, the relationship of Hetao is even more serious. It is not only the military center of the northwest border defense, but also a resource base for grains. However, over the years, heavy troops have been stationed there, and it has suffered many disasters, causing the people who migrated there to gradually decrease. It used to be a rich agricultural area, but now it is only wasteland. Even if we want to engage in reclamation, there is a lack of plowing cattle and few seedlings, making it necessary to re-plan to have any hope of regeneration. Once a major international event occurs, such as the realization of a Japanese-Soviet war, our border defense must be prepared. If we cannot fully utilize Hetao as a granary and a source of military food, the loss will be very significant. Therefore, to make preparations for border defense, in the far west, we must first stabilize the political situation in Sichuan and Kang, so that the Sichuan warlords accept the correct guidance of the central government and deeply regret the past mistakes of internal strife. Then, economic construction will have room to start, and the Tibetans will not waver. As for the other aspect, how to assist Xinjiang and how to protect Inner Mongolia, we must first strengthen our military force and reform politics. And the prerequisite for all of this depends on the development of agriculture in Hetao. The sound economic foundation is an important condition for consolidating the border.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Foreign Ministry issued unofficial remarks regarding Sino-Japanese relations, which read as follows: Japan's position is sufficient to do its utmost to fulfill its mission in the East. Although Japan's position towards China differs from that of other countries, hence the event of Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations, Japan believes that it is a natural move for it to maintain peace in the East and to be responsible for it itself. Japan is willing to share with China the responsibility for maintaining peace and security in the East. The restoration of order in China depends on China's own efforts. Therefore, Japan cannot but oppose actions by China that may conflict with peace in the East. Any actions by other countries that hinder peace in the East will also be opposed by Japan. Supplying China with military aircraft, military instructors, and political loans are all actions that will inevitably provoke Japan's opposition. Japan has heard that other countries are jointly assisting China, so it must explain Japan's position towards China. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">British House of Commons Filled to Hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer Explain the Budget - Balanced Revenue and Expenditure, Solid Finances - Tax Cuts and Salary Restorations to Alleviate People's Hardships - Trade Still Ranks First in the World - Debt Owed to the U.S. Not Included <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain is scheduled to present his third budget to the House of Commons this afternoon. Hours before, the parliament was already full. The House of Commons has 650 members, but only 450 seats. Therefore, early this morning, members rushed to reserve seats to avoid being left out. The scene in the House of Commons this afternoon was brilliant. The whole house was crowded, with almost no room to stand. Many members could not get seats and entered the galleries. The VIP seats were also full. The front row was occupied by ambassadors from various countries and other diplomats, all wanting to know how Britain could consistently balance its budget, and especially paying attention to how the Chancellor managed to obtain a rich surplus last year. The aristocratic seats were also full. The magnificent attire of the ladies further enhanced the splendor of the parliament. There was no sense of tension in the parliament. Outside the parliament, the people gathered, watching the ministers enter. When the Chancellor entered, he attracted even more attention.</p>
<p>After the Chancellor entered, he told reporters, "I hope that my recommendations will be satisfactory to the public and seen as the starting point for a return to prosperity."</p>
<p>The Chancellor is also scheduled to broadcast a summary of his budget to the nation via radio tonight, and the people are eagerly awaiting it.</p>
<p>After the meeting began, the usual question period followed, and the members were talking to each other, so the voices of the ministers answering hastily were difficult to hear clearly. Soon, the question period ended, and the parliament became a committee of the whole house. The speaker withdrew, and the chairman invited the Chancellor to attend, at 3:44 PM.</p>
<p>Amid cheers, the Chancellor stood up in front of the cabinet seats, opened the historically significant red leather briefcase of the Treasury, took out his budget, and delivered a speech for about an hour and a half. The Chancellor said that this budget was presented in a clearer atmosphere than the previous two years, which was very gratifying. The achievements of the last 12 months have proved that the government's efforts are gradually taking effect, and a new spirit of hope and trust has emerged. For example, 2.5% interest public bonds are now higher than before the war. Industrial production has increased significantly, and a balance of revenue and expenditure has been restored. Almost all progress is due to the expansion of the domestic market.</p>
<p>A surplus of £31 million will not be seen again in the future. Although export trade has improved, it is still dwarfed by what it was a few years ago. The true surplus for the past year can be said to be around £39 million, because the debt repayment reserve is also taken from this. If the people pay attention to the consumption of electricity, the production of transportation steel, and the number of houses built, they will surely see a real recovery of commerce. Britain has regained its position as the top exporting country, but the path of free flow formerly followed by international trade is still blocked. The feeling of economic nationalism is still spreading endlessly, so it is still difficult to see this path being followed. The people have even more terrifying new competition to seize the trade that Britain possesses.</p>
<p>The statistics for annual income are £724,567,000, and expenditure is £693,491,000, so income exceeds expenditure by more than £31 million. However, the extraordinarily low interest rates on national debt cannot be expected to last forever. The people who pay income tax fulfill their obligations with extraordinary enthusiasm, which is commendable. Britain received the largest amount of various taxes in this year, which is rare in history.</p>
<p>The exchange rate equalization fund also has a surplus. The surplus from last year will be used to repay debts and make up for the shortfall from the previous year.</p>
<p>As for this fiscal year, the British debt owed to the United States, and the war debts and reparations that Britain can collect, have not had any new developments, so it is planned to continue the method from last year and not make any provisions in the budget.</p>
<p>The tea tax revenue from the previous year was about £350,000 short. This was due to restrictions on the import of tea from India, Ceylon, and the Dutch East Indies, because the general price of tea rose due to the restrictions, leading to weak demand. The sugar tax revenue was also about £1 million short, which was the result of preferential treatment for imperial sugar production.</p>
<p>The fixed debt will still be £224,000,000, so the estimated expenditure will be £698,000,000. It is expected that the revenue from tariffs and domestic taxes, including beer, will increase. It is found that the beer tax alone had an increase of £5 million over the budgeted amount last year, so the total amount of the beer tax this year should reach £58,500,000.</p>
<p>The total revenue from tariffs and domestic taxes last year was £290,000,000. At the current tax rates, the estimated income should reach £727,000,000, and after adjustments, there should be a surplus of £29,000,000.</p>
<p>The huge surplus of the previous budget, which has not been seen in the past decade, can allow the government to begin the long-awaited relief for the general public, to alleviate the burden of sacrifices in the past few years. When the time comes, they will be able to meet the expectations of the people.</p>
<p>The Chancellor then proposed the power to guarantee new bonds issued for the swapping of existing guaranteed loans, and also proposed reducing the motor vehicle horsepower tax from one pound to fifteen shillings per horsepower, and restoring half of the salary cuts from 1931. As for the reduction in unemployment benefits, it will be fully restored in the future. Indirect taxes will not be reduced, and income tax will be reduced by sixpence.</p>
<p>The Treasury further announced that the additional budget for restoring half of the salary cuts will be calculated from July 1, and it is estimated that this restoration will require a total of £5.5 million for the whole year (this part of the restoration is related to civil servants, senior civil servants, teachers, police, naval and air force officers, and judges). It is estimated that income tax revenue can reach £240,000,000, which is £11,000,000 more than last year. Additional taxes can collect £50,000,000, and death duties can collect £76,000,000. The Chancellor also stated that the restoration of unemployment benefits must be implemented first. A bill will be submitted soon, stipulating that unemployment benefits will be fully restored from July 1. It is estimated that this will require £3,600,000 this year. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Secretary of State for India Abuses Prerogative - Forces the Revision of Opinion Papers on India - Criticized by Churchill in the House of Commons <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(London) A major event occurred in the House of Commons today, shocking the entire assembly. Conservative hardliner MP Churchill declared that a case of "abuse of privilege" should be reported to the House, involving Secretary of State for India Hoare and Lord Derby, a member of the Joint Select Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform. Churchill said that various economic groups had submitted opinion papers on the Indian issue. Among them, an opinion paper from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce was disliked by Hoare and Derby. The two then exerted intense pressure to force the Chamber of Commerce to withdraw the original opinion paper and revise it. Hoare and Derby are both members of the Joint Select Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform. This kind of behavior is an abuse of the Committee's privileges and should be investigated by the House. After Churchill's report, the entire House and the government agreed to conduct an investigation. Hoare also agreed to the investigation procedure, but stated that his intervention was not done in the name of a member of the Joint Select Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform, nor was its purpose to support the government's views on the Indian constitutional issue. His actions were all done in the name of the Secretary of State for India. At that time, commercial negotiations were underway between India and the United Kingdom, and his intervention was to ensure that these negotiations could continue, etc. This case has been handed over to the Committee of Privileges for review. The Committee is composed of representatives from all parties in the House, including MacDonald, Baldwin, and Attlee (Labour Party member), etc., totaling ten people, but none of them belong to the far-right of the Conservative Party. Whether Hoare's position in the cabinet will be shaken depends on the decision of the Committee of Privileges. If the facts stated by Churchill are deemed correct by the Committee of Privileges, and the Committee's interpretation is the same as Churchill's, then Hoare may not be able to avoid leaving the cabinet. Currently, the Conservative hardliners continue to campaign against the White Paper (the government's draft Indian constitutional reform), while supporters of the government are constantly giving speeches in the House of Commons, supporting the government's Indian policy.

<h3 id="e34">The Rise of the British Blackshirts - Resonates with Italian and German Pan-Nationalism - Under Mosley's Leadership - Party Members Reach 500,000 - Branches Established Throughout the Country Engaging in Military Training - Preparing to Participate in the Next General Election - Labour Party Uneasy <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British Blackshirts, now supported by influential newspapers, have become a cause for concern among politicians. Since Lord Rothermere used newspapers to promote to British youth the overthrow of the incompetent and senile politicians to save the motherland, and those who join the Fascist movement led by Mosley are increasing by the thousands every week. In less than two years of history, Lord Mosley has rigorously trained a small number of young people, and now has 500,000 party members. In the next British general election, the Fascist Party may threaten the existing system. At that time, they will campaign everywhere. Two months ago, British society did not pay much attention to Mosley, nor did it know the Blackshirts he led. Although the party occasionally clashed with the Communists in the streets, the newspapers never recorded it. The party's conventions and the speeches of its leaders were mostly ignored by the newspapers. Once Rothermere gave his support, the party was able to leap to the center of politics. The Labour Party newspapers and their leaders are now greatly uneasy about the party they have always despised. Lord Mosley has had the talent to lead since the beginning, and can promote fascism to all parts of Britain in an understated manner, to achieve success. Mosley has now established a brown house in London similar to Hitler's, and has built a large square building on Curzon Street to house the party members of his so-called defense force. The building can accommodate 5,000 people, and party members pay five shillings a week to get full room and board. Blackshirt comrades guard the entrance. Military training and brisk action of the party can also be seen almost everywhere. The internal company library, accounting, branch organizations, propaganda work, legal department, and self-defense forces, the headquarters review reports of meetings everywhere, and hold about 600 meetings a week. The headquarters often sends 15 to 20 propagandists to work in various places. The party now has two publications, one called Blackshirt and one called Fascist Weekly. The party has now completed the two phases of preliminary organization and propaganda, and the future goal is to complete the work for the next general election. The party leader said that British fascism is not modeled on Italy and Germany, but it is similar to Italian and German fascism. Lord Mosley said that fascism has been the creed of the 20th century, and we are transplanting it to British soil in a British method and form, to be compared with the current system, and can use the vitality of youth to establish a novel and noble culture, and will replace the warmongering class with patriotism. It is said that the Fascist parties of Britain, Germany, and Italy are now gradually resonating and sympathizing with each other, with the countries ruled by Mosleyism. The British Fascist movement is named the "British Union of Fascists" and now has more than 300 branches. It is also making rapid progress in industrial cities such as Liverpool and Manchester in the north. Internal disputes within the party have made Lord Mosley feel a little thorny, but the party's work has not been seriously affected. (National News, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Communist Countries Turn to Civil Rule - Determined to Reform Internal Affairs - Abolish the System of Private Torture <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian judicial authorities have now decided to adopt a new system due to the stability of the political situation. The date of its implementation is not far away, or may already be in progress. This new system is similar to that commonly used in Western civil countries. The key point of this reform is to abolish the death penalty or long-term imprisonment and exile imposed on the people by the Soviet Russian administrative authorities in the future. All political prisoners and other criminal offenders will henceforth be publicly tried in court, and secret trials by the secret police and various brutal private torture systems will no longer be used. In Soviet Russian prisons, there are still countless prisoners isolated from the world. An investigation is now underway. Once the new law is implemented, it will be explained as soon as possible, and it will not be long before this is done. Among them are many famous figures from the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary parties. Soviet Russian leader Stalin is now keenly aware of the progress of the economic situation, the need for people to operate farmland, and the progress of the Soviet Russian diplomatic position after the United States recognized the Soviet Russia, so he is determined to reform internal affairs. It is reported that 60% of the secret police have already been disbanded, and they have all been reassigned to factories and collective farms. An internal affairs department will be set up for this purpose. According to investigations, the total number of secret police reaches as many as 50,000, and they will soon be reorganized into the Ministry of the Army and become the new Red Army of Soviet Russia.

<p>(Paris) At 9:30 AM this morning, the cabinet members gathered at the Presidential Palace to hold a state affairs meeting. Interior Minister Sarraut proposed that Trotsky, the leader of the Soviet Russian anti-cadre faction, had not observed the obligation of political neutrality and should have his residence permit in French territory revoked. The state affairs meeting passed the proposal. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Barbizon) It is now believed that Trotsky may seek refuge elsewhere for fear that the White Russians will take action against him. Judging from the current situation, the French government may not ask him to leave France. It is found that Mr. Trotsky moved here from Corsica in July last year. His residence is heavily defended, surrounded by barbed wire obstacles, and kept several guard dogs. There are two pistols on the desk. Four months ago, Mr. Trotsky secretly obtained permission from the French government to reside in French territory due to the White Russians' attempt to assassinate him. No one knew about it at first, until his neighbors reported to the authorities that the people entering and leaving the house were suspiciously behaving. The police surrounded and searched it, and it was then revealed. Mr. Trotsky's wife told the police officers that her husband was preparing to organize a new party according to communism. It is also learned that Mr. Trotsky is now advocating the organization of the Fourth International, with revolution as the main principle. Therefore, the authorities are now strictly checking the large amount of mail that Mr. Trotsky sends and receives. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(New York) Eastman, a close friend of Trotsky, said today that the Fourth International has been completely organized and has established general offices in New York and other cities. Eastman has now received news from France that the government is deeply concerned that Mr. Trotsky will organize this kind of group when he appears in French territory, so he is making this statement. According to Eastman's statement today, the purpose of the Fourth International is world revolution. We all know that Mr. Trotsky now lives in Bami-Rang, France, but he was originally a person of interest to all parties, so his whereabouts are extremely secret, so as to avoid his life being poisoned by the Soviet Russian search team.

<p>(London) The German government's reply to the British inquiry about the reasons for increasing defense spending was distributed to members of the House of Commons today by British Foreign Secretary Simon. It stated that military spending increased by a total of 172 million marks, which was due to the situation in disarmament negotiations. The increase of 50 million marks in naval expenditure was due to the higher cost of renovating old ships. The ships were old and dilapidated, endangering the safety of the military personnel, so renovation could not be delayed any further. The budget of the German Aviation Ministry should not be regarded as a military budget but only as an air transport budget. The expenditure on aviation is now 160 million marks; in 1933, it was 77 million marks. This is because dilapidated postal aircraft must be replaced with new ones, private Lufthansa is now subsidized by the government, single-engine aircraft must be replaced with multi-engine aircraft, and the number of night flights must be increased because long-distance air routes operate the same in winter and summer. The document also stated that it is now necessary to increase the security of the skies and to develop overseas transportation. The construction of bright radio and other directional equipment for fifty locations will also require huge sums to accomplish. Sky protection costs are now a total of 50 million marks, compared with 1.3 million marks last year. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to well-informed political observers, there is little hope for the passage of the Silver Bill in this session of Congress. Although the White House has issued a statement by President Roosevelt requesting Congress to express its attitude on monetary issues, observers now believe that President Roosevelt has asked the leaders of both houses to shelve the Silver Bill and other currency bills in this session of Congress. It is said that President Roosevelt has now notified the leaders of the House that he will use the powers conferred by the Thomas Amendment to expand the utility of silver. This statement was also confirmed by Lanay when he met with the Associated Press reporter this afternoon. According to Lanay, there is sufficient indication that the Silver Bill will not be passed in this session because this session is scheduled to close in mid-May. President Roosevelt will use the powers conferred by the Thomas Amendment to support silver. Lanay continued that the President's opposition to the passage of the silver bill in this session is very obvious because the President wants to allow the silver purchase program to demonstrate what achievements it can ultimately have. However, the President strongly supports the Dies Bill, so he may not veto the bill. The silver faction in Congress met today and decided to directly petition President Roosevelt to cancel his plan to shelve the silver bill. Democratic Senator King hopes to have a consultation with the President within two or three days. At the same time, the various silver factions have decided to focus on the Dies Bill and hope that it will become the only silver bill passed by Congress. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Case of Secret Importation of a Large Quantity of Firearms from Japan (Japanese Correspondence) - Over 30,000 Pistols, 330,000 Rounds of Ammunition <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The meticulousness and rigor of the Japanese police are renowned as second in the world. Almost no illegal behavior can escape the reach of the law. However, in recent years, the underground movements of leftist groups have become particularly developed. Repeated investigations have failed to extinguish the intense movement, and it has even shown signs of spreading like wildfire. The right-wing movement can also gain the sympathy of some people and even receive assistance from active-duty soldiers and veterans, thus making their actions more convenient. However, their weakness lies in the lack of weapons. Pistols and bullets can be bought and sold openly in Japan, but not as freely as in European and American countries. They must be restricted by local police officials. For example, if someone wants to buy a pistol and some bullets, they must register with the police station. They must also report the use of each bullet. Otherwise, if a suicide or homicide case occurs, the person with the pistol should be inspected. However, under such a dense organization, the number of unregistered guns in Japanese society is countless, and this does not include the guns carried by the army and navy. Therefore, assassination cases continue to occur. High-ranking officials, whether *zaibatsu* or bureaucrats, are always vigilant and dare not say that nothing will happen.</p>
<p>This large-scale secret importation of pistols was discovered when the authorities investigated the robbery at the Kawasaki Hundredth Bank branch in Omori. The Communist Party's firearms were supplied by the Koda Firearms and Gunpowder Store in Kobe. At that time, Koda To was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison by the Osaka District Court. He refused to accept the sentence and appealed. He was released on bail in February of last year. However, he still refused to give up his secret business. In the warehouses of other accomplices, he still had 3,804 pistols and 333,800 rounds of ammunition. This is only what has been discovered. It is not known how much remains undiscovered. Because they operate very skillfully, their organization is very precise, and the people involved are very extensive, it is still impossible to be certain whether the number discovered is accurate. Now, let's give a brief account of Koda To himself.</p>
<p>Koda To is the main figure in this large-scale secret importation of pistols. His ancestral home is in Morioka Prefecture. He studied at Morioka Commercial School. At the age of fourteen, he dropped out of school and operated a gunpowder shop in Kobe with his uncle, Horio Eisuke. He lost five fingers on his right hand in an gunpowder explosion. He lived in that gunpowder shop for eight years, and thus understood the management methods of guns, cannons, and gunpowder. In Taisho 13 (1924), he obtained a license to operate a guns, cannons, and gunpowder shop himself. He then opened the Koda Firearms and Gunpowder Store in Kanomachi, Kobe. At that time, after the European War, there were many German small pistols left over from the war and overproduction, and there were no sales channels. Koda saw the way to come, and used his own years of training and the licensed gunpowder shop to contact the authorities to implement the large-scale import of pistols and the distribution of other military equipment. Therefore, he also obtained a license for a non-military goods repair shop. At that time, he resold the guns, cannons, and bullets imported from Germany to Tianjin, Qingdao, Manchuria, and other places. As a result, he made huge profits, owning assets of over a million. He then used mail ships traveling to and from Europe, only bringing back some parts of firearms, and then assembling them upon his return. The Japanese authorities also used this kind of business to sell guns to China, which was tolerable and beneficial to its aggression.</p>
<p>However, the only purpose of this profit-seeking business is to make profit. The so-called patriotic words are only a superficial saying. When there is great profit to be made, he will sacrifice his patriotism. Therefore, the Communist Party's weapons can be secretly purchased from the Koda Firearms and Gunpowder Store, and the same goes for right-wing groups. The selling price is 92 Japanese yen per Browning pistol and 45 yen for a revolver. At least 30,000 or more of these have been sold secretly in Japan, with no less than 400,000 rounds of ammunition. This will naturally</p>
<p>further arouse unease in Japanese society and shake the order of the political world. Only then did they begin searching and detain Koda. However, the firearms have already been dispersed. What has now been found is only what is stored in the warehouses, and the real difficulty does not lie in these few hundred seized guns. (April 13th, Tokyo)</p>

<p>Liaoning Correspondence: Japan is actively developing the rich mineral resources of Northeast China, nominally in the name of joint ventures between Japan and the puppet regime, and ordering the puppet state to contribute a portion of the funds. In reality, however, the power is entirely in the hands of the Japanese, completely controlled by the Japanese side. Recently, the so-called Japanese-puppet joint venture Manchurian Coal Mine Joint Stock Company was established, with a capital of 16 million yuan (of which 6.8 million yuan is invested by the puppet state's industrial sector, 1.2 million yuan is invested by the puppet Central Bank, 5 million yuan is invested by the South Manchuria Railway's industries, and 3 million yuan is in cash). In addition to the coal mines already mined by the South Manchuria Railway in Yantai and Benxihu, there are still large amounts of buried coal, all of which are controlled and developed by the coal mine company. The following is a summary of each coal mine:</p>

<p>The coal mine in Wuhuzui, Fuxian County, is extremely famous, about nineteen kilometers from Wafangdian Station, about eight kilometers from Sanlibao Station, and about forty minutes by sea from Sandawan. This coal mine was discovered during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. It was first operated by Chinese using native methods, and later fell into the hands of the Russians. After the Russo-Japanese War, the coal mine began to have relations with Japan, but it was still operated by Yan Wengui, a Chinese merchant from Dalian. Because of his strong capital, the business was very good. After Zhou's death, the coal mine was placed under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Mining Bureau of the former Liaoning Province. After the September 18th Incident broke out, the Mining Bureau was dissolved and taken over by the puppet state, which entrusted the South Manchuria Railway to operate it. The amount of coal buried in the coal mine has not been fully measured, so there are no accurate statistics, but according to the investigation of the old Northeast Mining Bureau, it is about 16 million tons. The coal mine has thirteen layers, with an average thickness of one meter to three meters. Because the coal is loose and weak, there are very few large pieces of coal, but because it has a semi-metallic luster, it can become anthracite coal, and the sulfur content is relatively low, so it is quite suitable for use as a raw material for coking. The coal mine's output is about 200,000 tons per year, based on past performance. Its sales channels are the three northeastern provinces, South China, Shandong, and various places in mainland Japan. The coal mine is the only place to supply anthracite coal in Manchuria and is close to the seaport, so its future is promising due to these superior conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Badaoju Coal Mine <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Badaoju Station in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, is about one kilometer south of the Datong Line, about three kilometers from Dahushan, about 137 kilometers from Jinzhou, and about 160 kilometers from Fengtian. It was discovered by local people in the eighth year of the Republic of China, and they began small-scale mining. Later, when Zhang Zuolin was the Inspector General, he inspected the area and paid attention to the coal mine. He sent his chief of staff to manage it, mainly to supply military needs. During the September 18th Incident, because it was managed by the Northeast Mining Bureau, it was confiscated and is now entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway for continued operation. Although the exact amount of coal buried in the coal mine has not yet been determined, it is estimated to be around 20 million tons. There are five or six coal seams, with a thickness of about one meter to five meters. The coal is mostly bituminous coal, with some close to lignite. Because it is jet black, it has a fatty luster, but this kind of coal is very easy to weather, so it is difficult to have any hope. The coal's sales channels are mainly Fengtian, Jinzhou, Yingkou, Tongliao, and along the Datong Line, for use in power plants. However, because there is no large market nearby, and it is hit by Fushun coal and Beipiao coal, it is increasingly in a difficult situation. However, the Japanese are planning to revive it.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Weiming Mountain Coal Mine <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Weiming Mountain is in Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, about seven or eight kilometers south of the Yantai Coal Mine, which belongs to the South Manchuria Railway, about 43 kilometers to Liaoyang, and about 71 kilometers to Shenyang. Although there was a fact that Koreans mined the coal mine in the early days, it was operated by the Tianhe Company, a Sino-Russian joint venture, in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign. After the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian rights were lost. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance invested in it, and it became a self-operated business of the provincial government. After the September 18th Incident, although it was temporarily managed by the local public security maintenance association, the mining was stopped due to the activities of the militia. Although there are no accurate statistics on the amount of coal buried in the coal mine, there are about 1.7 million tons in the Weiming area and about 7.68 million tons in the Xintai Peninsula area, totaling about 9 million tons. The coal mine is part of the Yantai Coal Mine. There are a total of eighteen coal seams, but only five have been mined, with a thickness of one meter to two meters. Due to the various differences in the coal seams, there are both anthracite and bituminous coal. As for sales channels, it has only been sold in Shenyang, Liaoyang, Yingkou, and other places, mostly for use in coal stoves. During the era of cheap silver, there was a considerable revival, but it is now at a disadvantage due to competition with Yantai coal.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Xinqiu Coal Mine <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Xinqiu is in Fuxin County, Rehe Province, in the mining areas of the Daxin and Daxing companies. It is 32 kilometers from Xinlitun Station on the Datong Line to the mining area. The coal mine was discovered in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign. It was first operated by the Beijing-Fengtian Railway. In the third year of the Republic of China, a technician from the Japanese Okura Group went to the area to inspect it, but was killed on the way, and demanded compensation, and then acquired the rights to the mining area. The Daxin and Daxing companies were reorganized as Sino-Japanese joint ventures. Before the September 18th Incident, the coal mine was exclusively needed by some parts of the testing cones. After the incident, mining was stopped due to the unrest. The amount of coal buried in the coal mine has not been thoroughly investigated, so its exact number is unknown, but according to the general measurement, the number should be 1.1 billion tons. The coal mine's coal seams are, from a general perspective, about three layers, with the lowest part being the best, and its thickness is particularly high, averaging from six meters to ten meters. Although the coal is very good, part of it is mostly bituminous coal that is jet black and very intolerant of fire, and is quite similar to Fushun coal. The coal's sales channels are only in the vicinity of the coal mine and Fuxin, Xinlitun, Heishan, Yixian, and other places, with a very small scope. However, the amount of coal buried in the coal mine is very rich in Manchuria, and it is also relatively easy to mine, so after the completion of the Huludao Seaport, the coal area can be used as the second Fushun.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Heligang Coal Mine <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Heligang is in Yangyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, about 500 kilometers down the Songhua River from Harbin, on the opposite bank of Jiamusi. There are more than 50 kilometers of railway dedicated to coal mines from Yunjiang, which can directly reach the mining area. The coal mine was discovered in the third year of the Republic of China. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, it began to be mined through official-merchant joint ventures. Zhang Xueliang, Wu Junsheng, and Guangxin Company all had very large relations with it. However, the local authorities, feeling the difficulty of funding, even had the idea of selling it to foreigners for a time. After the September 18th Incident, with the mediation of the puppet state's Ministry of Industry, a company was organized this spring to continue mining. The amount of coal buried in the coal mine is about 300 million tons in the old area and 300 million tons in the planned new mining area, totaling 600 million tons. There are six coal seams in the old mining area, with the thickest coal seam being four meters. There are also six coal seams in the new mining area, with a thickness of seven meters to ten meters. There are four open-pit mining areas, with a total area of 41,000 square meters and a depth of 15 meters. From the mountain peaks to the banks of the Songhua River, there are coal transportation railways for transportation, so its sales channels are along the Songhua River and the fuel for ships sailing on the river, as well as the Northern Manchurian, Hu-Hai, and Qi-Ke Railways, which are often its customers. Harbin, Anda, Suihua, Hailin, and other places are its main markets. The coal is a viscous, jet-black, high-quality bituminous coal, and its burial volume is particularly abundant. Even from the perspective of open-pit mining, it is beyond the reach of other coal areas. However, the Songhua River, which is its only transportation route, experiences obstacles in transportation when it freezes every winter, which is its shortcoming. Now, the Japanese are rushing to complete the railway network in order to increase the coal mine's output. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Living Buddha Nor-na Hutuktu of Xikang Arrives in Guangzhou to Perform a Seven-Day Dharma Ceremony for Eliminating Disasters and Benefiting the People <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Nor-na Hutuktu, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and a Living Buddha from Xikang, arrived in Guangzhou on the 8th of this month with seven people, including Li Gonglie, Yongzhong Lama, Cao Yabo, Qian Wenzhu, Wang Weibai, Gu Yaoshan, and Wang Zicai. They first went to the Liurong Temple. Several thousand Buddhist followers in the province held a meeting to welcome them at the temple. In the afternoon, the Disaster Elimination and People's Benefit Dharma Assembly also held a welcome meeting at the Provincial People's Education Center, with even more devout men and women attending. Nor-na said to the crowd, "Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the five races have been one family. I came to Beijing in the 18th year of the Republic of China and performed Dharma ceremonies for society four times before and after. This time coming south is the fifth Dharma ceremony. I will sincerely pray to relieve suffering and help those in need. Both Confucianism and Buddhism advise people to do good. Evil comes from an evil heart, and good comes from a good heart. If people can practice Dr. Sun Yat-sen's so-called psychological transformation, the world will naturally be peaceful." After the meeting, Nor-na took a car to the Bailingshan Leili, ascended to Nengren Temple, and prepared for the Dharma ceremony. Later, because those seeking an audience came in droves and the altar had not yet been fully arranged, he went down the mountain on the 11th at the invitation of Chen Jitang to preach. The reporter took the opportunity to visit him at the temple. Nor-na said that this time the Dharma ceremony for the Disaster Elimination and People's Benefit Association would begin around the 13th and would take about seven days. Afterwards, he would grant initiations and establish karmic connections for his disciples at the request of the public. He plans to leave Guangzhou next month, not returning to Ningbo, and will return to Xikang via Annam or Yunnan Province. In the Kang-Tibetan region, all religions worship the Buddha. Although there is the Yellow Sect, the White Sect, and the Red Sect, there is actually no difference in doctrine. However, the Red Sect has the oldest history. The White Sect began in the 1903rd year of the true transmission of Sakyamuni, and the Yellow Sect has only been practiced in Kang-Tibet for more than 400 years. The Red Sect is divided into outer, inner, and innermost esoteric sects. Outer and inner esoteric sects are mostly worshiped in the front and rear Tibet, while in Xikang, outer, inner, and innermost esoteric sects are all worshiped. Esoteric and exoteric practices are both emphasized and interconnected. One cannot become a Buddha without the other. The government and religion of the Kang-Tibetan region have always been unified. There are four Hutuktus in Kang-Tibet who are in charge of religious, political, military, and other affairs. Tibet was formerly under the Panchen Lama, and later under the Dalai Lama. However, in Xikang, all religious, political, and military affairs are under my control. The population of Xikang is about 7 million. Because the area belongs to the border region, it has long been coveted by foreigners. A portion of Tibet has long been occupied by the British, and another portion has been invaded by the French. Recently, border wars have broken out again, and the future seems worrying.</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Auditing Office Actively Rectifies the Changlu Salt Affairs, Appointing Zeng Yangfeng as Manager and Transport Commissioner <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Changlu salt affairs have long been known for their corruption and mismanagement. In particular, the anti-smuggling police are extremely corrupt, engaging in embezzlement and dereliction of duty. These malpractices have become deeply ingrained habits. They openly smuggle salt and extort fees, treating it as normal. They even fabricate charges and demand payments that are more than fifteen times the price of the salt. As a result, private smuggling has become rampant, and official sales have sharply decreased. In the twelfth year of the Republic [1923], the official sales in the Zheng'an area of the region were about 3.75 million dan [unit of dry measure]. Later, this number gradually decreased. By the twenty-second year of the Republic [1933], official sales were only about 2.64 million dan. The loss in tax revenue was about 8 million yuan. Ineffective anti-smuggling efforts were the main reason for this situation. The Chief Auditing Office, recognizing this problem, specifically appointed Chief Inspector Zeng Yangfeng to concurrently serve as Manager of the Changlu Branch Office and Transport Commissioner to carry out rectification. Since taking office, he has shown great determination to reform the system, and his achievements are already apparent. Both internal and external personnel have shown renewed vigor. In the past, it took a week after reporting the shipment to receive the approval documents and transportation permits. Now, they can be obtained the next day. Everything is no longer as slow and inefficient as it was before, and the bad practices have been eliminated. It is reported that the anti-smuggling team was reorganized into a tax police force on April 1st, with a total of 2,100 officers and police. They are divided into seven districts. The district chiefs are either selected from those who have rich experience in anti-smuggling in the district or transferred from the successful tax police officers of Lianghuai. A tax police soldier training institute has also been established. Officers and police are rotated for training to get to the root of the problem and make rectification easier. The Henan Inspection Bureau, which was previously funded by anti-smuggling donations, has been abolished. Its duties have been transferred to the Sales Supervision Bureau. The savings from this have been used to train three special task force squads, which will actively rectify saltpeter production in the future. In addition, Manager Zeng has also proposed seven measures for reorganizing the Changlu salt affairs: 1. Management of salt fields: Fragmented and scattered salt fields should be consolidated, and ditches and roads should be dug and built around the outer perimeter of the salt fields to facilitate anti-smuggling. Field affairs offices and tax police stations should be established to manage the field property. 2. Management of abandoned salt fields: Roads should be built and police stations should be set up to prevent the concealment of bandits and maintain local security. 3. Management of local salt areas: As a short-term solution, widespread publicity should be conducted to discourage consumption and cooperate with local governments to strictly prohibit transportation and sale. Then, opportunities should be taken to destroy the pans and pools used to produce local salt. As a long-term solution, soil experts should be hired to test the technique of changing the properties of alkaline soil to benefit agriculture. 4. Management of Liaoning and Eastern smuggling: The customs should be requested to assist in investigating maritime smuggling, and police stations should be set up along the coast to serve as watchposts. 5. Reorganization of anti-smuggling efforts: The reorganization should be carried out by imitating the methods of the Lianghuai tax police. 6. Improvement of transportation merchants: The regulations for managing transportation merchants should be revised. The minimum quantity of salt to be transported per shipment should be set for each port, and transportation merchants should be held responsible for transporting the full amount. The selling price should be reviewed at any time, and the quality of salt should be inspected to reduce the burden on the people and benefit official sales. 7. Improving work efficiency: The management of salt mounds and salt fields should be the responsibility of the inspecting personnel from the auditing side and the field affairs personnel from the field offices, respectively. The Tanggu branch office should be abolished and a salt mound supervision office should be established to simplify the chain of command and facilitate command. All the above reorganization plans have been reviewed by the Salt Affairs Administration and the Chief Auditing Office and will be implemented in order. It can be predicted that official sales will be smooth and tax revenue will increase sharply in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e94">A Drug Manufacturing Organization Was Uncovered in Xuzhou; Seven People Jointly Manufactured Heroin; The Offender, Jiang ZhanKui, is Detained in the County Government <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: When Li Yannian was the garrison commander of Xuzhou some time ago, a large-scale drug manufacturing organization was uncovered. It was managed by well-known figures in Xuzhou. The manufacturing plant was located in the home of Zhang Weishun, a wealthy man in Yongcheng County. Li sent troops from the Ninth Division to arrest Zhang and also arrested Liu Bingchen, Ding Yinzhou, Cao Ziting, Jiang Zhankui, Wen Baoyu, etc. Liu and Ding fled quickly upon hearing the news. Cao, Jiang, and Wen were arrested successively. At that time, local people all advocated for strict punishment. However, Li was about to leave Xuzhou, so they were leniently sentenced to pay 100,000 yuan. Before the money could be paid, they were sent to the county prison. During the term of the previous County Magistrate Yu, the detainees requested bail to raise the money. They were released on bail one after another and paid a small amount of the gambling debt. Afterward, as time passed and circumstances changed, the fugitives secretly returned to Xuzhou. This case had been dormant for a long time. However, Jiang Zhankui, who was a leader of the mob, did not repent. After being released on bail, he colluded with many people to secretly set up a plant near Zifang Mountain in the Eastern Station area to manufacture heroin. It was stipulated that each person had one share, and each share was 500 yuan. There were as many as seven partners. There were two drug-making machines. The county government arrested two drug dealers, Dai Xiaochun and Chen Yuankui, and learned the inside story. County Magistrate Wang sent police officers to Jiang Zhankui's place, pretending to be Zhengzhou merchants who wanted to buy heroin for resale with 200 yuan in cash. Jiang thought they were in the same business and discussed the price back and forth. On the evening of the 12th, the money and goods were exchanged. Several other police officers lay in ambush outside the room. When the goods were delivered, they rushed in and arrested Jiang. He was taken to the county government for secret interrogation. Jiang confessed that he had set up a factory to make drugs. The shareholders were Zhao Shoushan of Sanduo Pharmacy, Mi Heng of Huabei Hotel, Cao Yunzhen, Wang Zhaoji of Jinpu Hotel, Liu Peiji of Jiangbei Restaurant, and Liu Xiwu, a resident of Zifang, totaling seven people. The two manufacturing machines were both located at Liu Xiwu's home, and Li Lantings was hired as a technician. The drug-making machines were purchased by Zhao and Cao in Shanghai. Using opium as raw material, they could produce fifty or sixty taels [unit of weight, approx. 1.3 oz] per day. They started manufacturing in October of last year, and the raw materials were purchased from the Tongguan area, etc. After hearing the confession, County Magistrate Wang immediately sent police officers with secret warrants to arrest each of the criminals in their homes and shops. However, all the criminals had fled upon hearing the news. Only drugs and sundries were found in Liu Xiwu's home, and the drug-making machines had also been dismantled and hidden. Jiang is currently detained in the county government, and the remaining criminals are still being hunted. Local people attach great importance to this case and advocate strict legal action.

<h3 id="e95">Songjiang: Continued Report on the Lantern Parade Incident Causing Trouble <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Villagers near Tinglin, because of the dragon lantern parade, disobeyed the prohibition of the Public Security Bureau branch, which led to the destruction of the Public Security Bureau branch in the town. It is now learned that since the district office and the public security organs convened a meeting with the heads of various towns and villages, the villagers Gu A'gen, Gu A'wu, Jiang Kunquan, and others were arrested, identified as the main culprits, and sent to the county bureau for legal action. As a result, the farmers near the town have all fled, which will hinder spring plowing. According to villagers from the area who came to Songjiang to report the situation, the three men were beaten by the police after being detained by the sub-bureau. However, it is still doubtful whether the three men are indeed the perpetrators of the lantern parade incident. Therefore, Mei Shuibu, the head of the district, has submitted a request to the county government, asking that innocent people not be implicated to avoid hindering spring farming.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Suzhou: Detailed Account of Qiu Chunwu's Suicide <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Chunwu, a Suzhou native who is currently working as a clerk at the Shanghai Gold Exchange, suddenly committed suicide by hitting himself on the railway tracks near the Zhenru station a few days ago. His brains splattered, and his death was very tragic. His coffin was transported to Suzhou on the 16th. The details of the case are recorded below. Qiu, whose courtesy name is Wu Hong and who is also known as Shu Bin, is 22 years old. He has four brothers, and he and his second brother are currently working at the Gold Exchange, enjoying a comfortable life. His home is located at No. 115 Xiangfu Temple Lane in Suzhou. His father's name is Rong Sheng, and his family has a small amount of land. Qiu and his brothers were born to his father's concubine, Madam Wang. He liked Peking Opera and often went to the Shanghai Datong Peking Opera Club in his spare time. About three weeks ago, Qiu and several friends went to visit the Wusong Fort. At that time, a hurricane suddenly arose, blowing Qiu's mud hat into the Pudong beach. Qiu was about to bend down to pick it up when another gust of wind came, causing Qiu to lose his footing and fall into the river. Fortunately, he was familiar with the water and did not drown. He then returned to Suzhou to rest. On the eighth of this month, he went to Shanghai to work. On the twelfth, his second brother returned to Suzhou for business. Later, he suddenly went missing. The staff in his office sent a letter to Suzhou to inquire whether Qiu had returned home. Qiu's family was extremely panicked (because according to the rules of the office, the two brothers could not ask for leave at the same time unless there was a special accident). They replied to the office and asked them to investigate on their behalf. However, on the afternoon of the next day (the 13th), Qiu's family suddenly received a telegram from the Nanxiang District Office, stating that a young man was found near Jilu Lane, Cheng Ba Tu, Shenghua Township, near the Beijing-Shanghai Railway near Zhenru, wearing a camel hair robe, covered with a blue cloth shirt, twill pants, and yellow-striped leather shoes, died there, hoping to come and identify him quickly. His brother received the telegram and went to check with his uncle Xifan on the same day. They saw that it was indeed Qiu's body and found a suicide note addressed to his parents next to him. It briefly stated that he had no choice but to take this path, but it was not for economic reasons, not for love, and not related to friends. He expressed his gratitude for their upbringing and said that he would repay them in the next life. He asked them to take care of themselves and not to be sad about his death, etc. He then asked the local county government for permission to waive an autopsy and transported the coffin back to Suzhou. The reason for his suicide is still unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Wuxi: Active Factory Inspections Are Underway <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In order to improve factory management and increase factory production, the Ministry of Industry has decided to implement factory inspections in stages, with a five-year deadline. Wuxi, as the county with the most factories in the interior of Jiangsu Province, is particularly difficult to promote. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has specially dispatched Han Xicheng, Secretary of the Central Factory Inspection Office, and Cheng Qijun, Factory Inspection Commissioner of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, to come to Wuxi to discuss with County Magistrate Yan and Bureau Chief Zhang of the Construction Bureau. It has been decided to start with the cotton spinning and flour industries. The Chamber of Commerce has been invited to send letters to various factories in the two industries, asking them to send responsible representatives to a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 17th to discuss the implementation procedures. Yesterday afternoon, Bureau Chief Zhang of the Construction Bureau accompanied the two commissioners from the Ministry and the Province to attend the meeting. The textile industry was represented by seven factories, including Shenxin, Qingfeng, Guangqin, Zhenxin, Yukang, Lixin, and Yeqin. The flour industry was represented by four factories, including Maoxin No. 1 and No. 2, Jiufeng, and Tailong. First, Mr. Han explained the factory inspection system. The first to pilot the system was the United Kingdom, which has a history of more than 100 years. Subsequently, countries around the world have followed suit and achieved good results. The Chinese government, in order to improve its international standing and develop its industrial plans, has formulated the Factory Inspection Law in order to implement it step by step. At present, governments in various provinces and cities are actively carrying it out. The Shanghai Chinese Concession factories have been inspected by Tian Heqing and others sent by the municipal government. Zhejiang, Shandong, Henan, Yunnan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Hankou, Weihaiwei, and other places are also making efforts by the respective provincial and municipal governments, and the results are good. Wuxi is a factory area, which is related to the expectations of China and foreign countries. This work really cannot be delayed any longer. The current needs of the environment should be carefully reviewed, and the implementation procedures for factory inspection should be formulated. The order of priority should be determined according to the urgency, difficulty, and ease of implementation, so that it is easier to promote and achieve practical results. Finally, the method of starting inspections of various factories was discussed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Changshu: A Major Fire at Canghai Temple on Yushan Mountain <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>On the 16th of this month (the 3rd day of the 3rd month of the lunar calendar), according to local customs, there has been a custom of pilgrimage on this day since the Ming Dynasty. The incense societies from various villages all take the Xuan Di Ancestral Temple in Canghai Temple on the top of Yushan Mountain outside the west gate as their destination. On this day, the pilgrimage is no less crowded than the Tianzhu Temple in Hangzhou. However, this year it is even more prosperous than in the past. Pilgrims and spectators, from the west gate to Ancestor Mountain, a distance of about five miles by land and water, are all walking one after another. And the monks in the entire temple on the mountain rely on the income of this one day for their food and clothing for the year. However, on the night of this day, the pilgrims scattered. The monks in the temple were cleaning up and tidying up, and they did not go to sleep until 3 a.m. on the 17th. After a while, they were suddenly awakened by the sound of wood exploding. They quickly put on their clothes and got up to look. They suddenly saw that the Great Compassion Hall in the back was on fire, and the fire was very fierce. However, there were no neighbors in the mountains, and they could not call for help. Moreover, there was a lack of firefighting equipment on the mountain, and there was no way to draw water. Therefore, they could only sit and watch. It was not until dawn that hundreds of villagers from the foot of the mountain climbed up to extinguish the fire. The burned buildings include the Great Compassion Hall, Amitabha Pavilion, Wenchang Pavilion, East and West guest rooms, and the main kitchen. Except for the main hall and the Hall of Three Lives Buddhas, the remaining dozens of temple buildings were all reduced to ashes. However, the amount of loss this time is particularly shocking. Just the income on that day was about 3,000 taels of silver. In addition, there were various utensils and miscellaneous items donated by various incense societies, as well as hundreds of paintings and calligraphy by famous figures from ancient and modern times in the temple. The total is estimated to be around 30,000 taels of silver. It is also known that during the fire, two temple keepers, because they had not slept for many days and were extremely tired, did not wake up in time to escape and were buried in the fire. One was 55 years old, and the other was 15 years old. The situation was extremely tragic. Now, the abbot of the temple, Monk Zhiguang, is extremely anxious.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Changzhou: Re-registration for Adding Rickshaws <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Wu County Government previously planned to add 300 rickshaws, including 100 in the city area and 200 on various roads, inviting merchants to register and claim them. Each rickshaw was required to pay a car price of 60 yuan and a public welfare donation of 120 yuan. Later, because no one took it up, it was submitted to the province for approval. It was ordered to cancel the distinction between urban and rural areas and re-register within a limited time. County Magistrate Cai specifically raised the matter for general discussion at the administrative meeting on the 16th. The resolution is excerpted below: 1. The Provincial Department ordered the registration of 300 vehicles. According to the needs of local transactions, half of them will be released first. For example, if 10 licenses are received, 5 will be released first, and so on. 2. Each vehicle will pay a public welfare donation of 120 yuan, and the price of each vehicle is 80 yuan, which will be deposited in the bank for verification. 3. The vehicles will be changed to chartered cars, and the style will be specified by the third section of the county government and manufactured accordingly. 4. When existing vehicles are inspected, if they are found to be old and unsuitable for riding, they should be ordered to be renovated according to the new style within a limited time. Otherwise, the license will be revoked and compensated by vehicles that have received new licenses but have not yet taken to the streets. 5. If the registration exceeds the quota, it will be determined by drawing lots. 6. The registration date is from April 21st to April 23rd.</p>

<p>Xu Qinwen was implicated in the case of Tao Sijin's tragic murder of Liu Mengying. Liu's sister, Qingxing, sued him for obstructing family harmony, and the Supreme Court ruled him innocent. However, Liu Mengying often lived in Xu's residence in Lotus Pavilion, and she and her friends held gatherings there. The prosecutor of the Zhejiang High Court investigated and found that Liu Mengying was actually a Communist Party member, and Xu Qinwen knew that Liu was a traitor but allowed her to stay, which constituted a crime of harming the Republic of China. He was prosecuted and sentenced to five years in prison and sent to the military prison for execution last fall. It is now learned that the Supreme Court believes that there is some doubt as to whether Xu knew that Liu was a communist. Therefore, yesterday, it specially sent the case back to the Zhejiang High Court for retrial, which is expected to begin soon.</p>

Subsequently, the prosecutor refused to accept the acquittal and appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back for retrial.

This matter has gradually become more favorable than last year, so promoting it will be even more beneficial. In the near future, new problems will arise between China and Japan." It is heard that Envoy Arichi plans to return to his country on the Ryuta Maru on the 21st or the Shanghai Maru on the 25th.</p>

<h3 id="e124">New Clues Found in China Aviation Company Plane Crash Yesterday: Fishermen Recovered Lost Mailbags in the Waters Off Huangmang Mountain, Zhenhai County; Reports of Finding the Plane Are Misleading <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, the China Aviation Company's No. 17 Sikorsky aircraft has been missing for a week. Yesterday morning, two mailbags scattered from the crashed plane were discovered in the waters off Zhenhai. The mailbags were recovered by a fisherman surnamed Zhang in the waters off Huangmang Mountain near Zhenhai. After receiving this information, the company sent Alison and two others by plane to search the area yesterday. They returned to Shanghai at around 3:00 PM, but no new discoveries were made. It is generally speculated that the plane has undoubtedly sunk and been destroyed at sea. The company will hire boats starting today to conduct a detailed search in the waters near Zhenhai. The reports yesterday from Hangzhou stating that the missing plane had been found were misleading. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Discovery of Scattered Mail from Missing Plane <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the China Aviation Company received two bags of mail scattered from the No. 16 missing plane, brought in by the Xinjiang Tianlun steamer. The items were recovered on the morning of the day after the plane went missing (i.e., the 11th) by fisherman Zhang Huixi while fishing near Huangmang Mountain, five miles from Zhenhai. After realizing that they were from the China Aviation Company's missing plane, they were handed over to Lin Jiexian, who was left in Zhenhai with the damaged No. 19 plane. Lin then entrusted the Xinjiang Tianlun steamer to bring them to Shanghai with a letter. This is the process of the discovery. The items included a yellow canvas official mailbag from the China Aviation Company with the word "Swatow" written on it in English, containing a book of China Aviation Company passenger tickets, two daily postal transport report forms, one daily passenger ticket report form, and an English pilot report form. All of the above items were intended for use by the company's Fuzhou station. In addition, there was a small white postal bag from the Postal Administration with the words "Shanghai No. 45-394" written on it, containing a small box of rubber nipples for baby milk bottles, sent by the Ke Fa Pharmacy in Shanghai to the Fuzhou station. All of the above items had water stains and yellow mud marks due to being washed by seawater.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Another Plane Dispatched Yesterday to Search and Track <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After learning of this clue, the China Aviation Company consulted and decided to send pilot Alison in a Lockheed aircraft at 11:00 AM yesterday, along with Gleeson and Chinese mechanic Mr. Gao, to search the waters near Huangmang Mountain and the surrounding islands, hoping for further new discoveries. They then flew to Zhenhai and landed. Gleeson and Mr. Gao stayed in Zhenhai and hired a boat with Mr. Lin this morning, along with the fisherman who found the mail, to search the waters near Zhenhai and the surrounding islands, hoping to find other clues. Alison flew back to Shanghai by plane at 3:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e127">General Speculation: People and Plane All Sank <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Based on the lost items found yesterday, it is speculated that the missing plane and its passengers have all perished without a doubt. Moreover, the fuselage must have shattered upon entering the water; otherwise, the mail would have been difficult to discover. However, according to Manager Dai of the China Aviation Company, speaking to a reporter from Shenshi News Agency, they still have one last hope: that the passengers may have been rescued by fishermen on nearby islands, but due to injuries and language barriers, they were unable to immediately send news. However, this is just a hope against all odds. The company will make further efforts to search in the coming days, regardless of life or death, in order to bring the matter to a conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Board Meeting to Improve Flight Routes <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>After the plane crash, the company has decided to hold a full board meeting at 5:00 PM this Friday to discuss all follow-up issues. At the same time, how to ensure the safety and improvement of China Aviation's existing routes will also be discussed separately. According to a company announcement yesterday, the Shanghai-Guangdong route will be actively resumed, and new aircraft will be purchased from the United States in the coming days. Whether to continue using Sikorsky aircraft or purchase other types will be decided after the board meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Reports of Finding the Aviation School Plane Are Misleading <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Aviation News Agency, the reports yesterday from Hangzhou stating that the missing plane had been found by the aviation school are completely false. The plane found in the waters near the Weiyuan Fort in Zhenhai was actually the No. 40 plane, which was forced to land and damaged while searching for the missing plane. Furthermore, the reports that passenger numbers on the company's Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Beiping routes have decreased due to the Shanghai-Guangdong plane crash are not entirely accurate. Even before the plane crash, there were often periods of low passenger numbers on these two routes. Moreover, the Shanghai-Hankou route flies along the river, allowing for safe landings at any time, and the stations are close together, making it convenient to report weather conditions and inspect aircraft. The Shanghai-Beiping route has never experienced any unfortunate incidents, and the company plans to purchase new aircraft to operate on this route in order to reduce flight time.</p>

Although the school dispatched aircraft for reconnaissance, no findings were made. This is hereby clarified. Central Aviation School Seal.</p>

<p>According to New Sound News Agency, in order to facilitate the development of postal services for the people, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated regulations for the joint establishment of postal and telegraph offices and has issued strict orders to the Directorate General of Posts and the relevant telegraph bureaus to comply with the contents of the regulations. The original texts of the Ministry's orders to Shanghai and other postal and telegraph offices yesterday are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Joint Establishment Plan: The most important aspects of the joint establishment regulations are the following two: (1) Telegraph bureaus of the third class or below in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces shall all be jointly established with local post offices. (2) Telegraph receiving offices shall be set up in all postal branches in major commercial ports throughout the country, and postal branches shall be set up in all telegraph bureau receiving and dispatching offices (note: the major commercial ports referred to have been designated by the Ministry of Communications as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Chongqing, Xiamen, Changsha, Shantou, Zhangjiakou, Yichang, Fuzhou, Xi'an, Ningbo, Yantai, Guiyang, Jinan, Wanxian, Wuhu, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, Shashi, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Chengdu, Suiyuan, Hangzhou, Taiyuan, Xuzhou, Anqing, Wenzhou, Jiujiang, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Quanzhou, Bengbu, Wuzhou, Nanning, Wuchang, Changde, Baoding, Kunming, Qinhuangdao, Kaifeng, and Shijiazhuang, a total of 47 locations). Currently, all locations have begun to implement the first regulation separately. Regarding the second regulation, all locations have made excuses such as small houses and unsuitable locations to delay and postpone implementation. The establishment of telegraph receiving offices in post offices has not been widespread, and the establishment of postal branches in telegraph bureau receiving and dispatching offices is even rarer.</p>
<p>Newly Revised Regulations: In order to promote new policies and benefit the people, the Ministry of Communications yesterday (the 17th) specially stipulated three regulations and ordered all postal and telegraph bureaus to comply: (1) Postal bureaus and their branches in Shanghai and other places must universally establish telegraph receiving and dispatching offices, regardless of grade, without exception. If the postal branch houses are too small to accommodate them, they should be relocated to suitable houses in order to be jointly established with the nearest telegraph bureau or receiving and dispatching office. The receiving and dispatching office may also be equipped with a telegraph machine. (2) Telegraph bureaus in Shanghai and other places must universally establish postal branches. If the houses are too small, they should be relocated to suitable houses in order to be jointly established with the nearest post office or postal branch. (3) The original receiving and dispatching offices of telegraph bureaus in Shanghai and other places should be abolished. Those that are allowed to be retained due to special circumstances, such as important locations and special business connections, must still have postal branches set up by the post office, without exception. The Ministry of Communications has strictly ordered all relevant bureaus to strictly comply with the above three regulations. Those who make excuses to delay will be dealt with for dereliction of duty.</p>
<h3 id="e133">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company New "Four Seas" Ships Officially Named: Hai Yuan, Hai Heng, Hai Li, Hai Zhen; Design Logos Also Drawn Up; To Be Sent to England Immediately for Manufacturing According to the Style <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company used Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds to order four "Four Seas" ships from England to expand the South China shipping routes. Wu Damming and Shi Gan were specially sent to London to supervise the construction, which has already begun. The first batch of two ships is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of September, and the second batch of two ships is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of December. The ship names and application designs for the new ships were finalized by the company yesterday and sent to the Jianghai Customs for inquiries. There were no duplicates. The ship names, etc., will be sent to England immediately for manufacturing according to the style. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>New Ship Names Finalized: The names of the four new ships ordered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in London were initially drafted by the company's secretariat and shipping department with the characters "Guo" (National), "Hua" (China), and "Hai" (Sea) and submitted to the board of directors for selection. After discussion by the board of directors, it was decided that since the two recently purchased Norwegian ships used the names "Hai Rui" and "Hai Xiang," the four new "Four Seas" ships should also be named with the character "Hai." They were changed to "Hai Yuan," "Hai Heng," "Hai Li," and "Hai Zhen" as the names of the four new ships. After formal approval by the board of directors, they were sent to the shipping department and forwarded to Wu and Shi in London.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Customs Reply: Names Can Be Used <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The shipping department, noting that many Chinese merchant ships in recent years have used names with the character "Hai," had to inquire in advance to determine whether the four new ship names were the same as those of other ships. They sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs, which replied yesterday that after a thorough search of incoming and outgoing ships, there were no names identical to these four new ship names, and they could be used.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Design of the Character "挻" (Shun) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The ship names, due to the large size of the ships, must be six feet square. Qian Jinding of the shipping department wrote out the eight characters "Hai Yuan," "Hai Heng," "Hai Li," and "Hai Zhen" yesterday in preparation for sending them to Wu to have them placed on the outer hull of the ships in the same style. The design logos for all items used on the new ships were also drafted by the company and consist of a round shape resembling a lifebuoy with the national flag and the company flag crossed in the middle, the five characters "Guo Ying Zhao Shang Ju" (National China Merchants Steam Navigation Company) horizontally above, and a shape resembling a sailor's belt drawn below. However, there are no English characters in the design. It was drawn up yesterday and will be sent to London along with the ship names for manufacturing.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Crew and Technicians to Go to England in Batches <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The "Hai Yuan" and "Hai Heng" are the first two new ships to be built. The company-assigned crew and technicians who need to go to England to practice on the new ship machinery have already provided their resumes and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications. As soon as the approval order arrives in Shanghai, technician and director of the Inland China Merchants Factory Huang Zonglun, chief engineer of the Jiahe ship Li Guoquan, two third engineers, and two marine engineering students selected from the Wusong Merchant Marine School will be sent to the British shipyard for practice first. It is planned that these six people will go abroad by early May at the latest. Captains Ma Jiajun and Teng Shibiao, who will go to pick up the ships, will be sent to England from Shanghai in July.</p>

<p>Recently, the water level of the Sichuan River has risen sharply, making navigation even more difficult for ships on the upper Yangtze River. With even slight carelessness, ships may hit reefs. A foreign merchant ship company in Shanghai received a telegram from Yichang yesterday stating that the Minsheng Company's Minqiang ship suddenly hit a reef above Yichang. The ship's hull was damaged, and it sank completely before rescue could be carried out. This matter is of great importance. The situation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Difficult Navigation Due to Rising Water in Sichuan River <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan River waterway in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, from Yichang to Chongqing, is the most difficult to navigate. There are numerous dangerous shoals in the river, making navigation very dangerous. During the low water period, it is easier to see the shoals. From the first of this month, the river water has been rising daily, and the submerged reefs and beaches are covered by the river water. If the river pilot is even slightly careless, the ship's hull may hit a submerged reef. Therefore, upper Yangtze River ships regard this "insufficiently risen water" period as the most difficult period for Sichuan River ship navigation.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Minqiang Ship Hits a Reef <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the Minsheng Company has the most ships navigating the Sichuan River. Their routes are divided into the Shanghai-Chongqing and Yichang-Chongqing routes. The Minqiang ship, with a deadweight of 200 tons, is used for Shanghai-Chongqing navigation during the low water period and operates on the Chongqing-Yichang route during the high water period. This time, it was loaded with cargo and passengers from Chongqing. On the 15th of this month, the ship was passing through the Shiguan Shoal. After passing the shoal, it sailed to the Xintan River surface, where there are many submerged reefs (above Miaohua, opposite Yaowan). It was also during the rising water period, and there was fog. The pilot's careless navigation caused the ship's hull to hit a submerged reef on the Xintan River. The water rushed in quickly, and the ship's hull immediately broke.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Entire Ship Submerged in the River <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>After the Minqiang ship broke, river water rushed into the cabin madly. Because the cargo was loaded in each cabin, the ship sank immediately due to the heavy load and the reef. Yesterday afternoon, Shanghai received a telegram from Yichang stating that after the Minqiang ship hit a reef in Xintan, the bottom of the cabin was severely damaged, and it could not be rescued. The ship's hull was completely submerged in the river.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Number of Losses Unknown <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The cargo loaded in the ship also sank into the river with the ship. All crew members, sailors, and passengers on board fled for their lives in sampans and other small boats. Some were rescued by passing civilian boats, sailboats, and merchant ships. The Chongqing Minsheng Company headquarters has also dispatched ships to the site of the accident for rescue. As for cargo losses and crew and passenger injuries, it is currently unknown. Detailed reports are expected in the next day or two.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Workers Resumed Work Yesterday; Some Workers Also Entered No. 9 Factory; Other Factories Continue Strike <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The strike by workers at the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory has lasted for more than a month. After the joint announcement by party and government agencies, they were ordered to resume work, and the issue of wage reduction will be resolved through legal mediation. It is reported that more than 1,000 workers at the main factory of Ma Lang Jing Wei in the French Concession entered the factory yesterday morning and resumed work as usual. Fifty or so workers also entered the No. 9 Factory on Xujiahui Road and resumed work. Other factories, such as No. 2 Factory on Jiaotong Road, No. 3 and No. 4 Factories on Jiaozhou Road, No. 5 Factory on Luban Road, No. 6 and No. 8 Factories on Xietu Road, No. 7 Factory on Quzhenren Road, and No. 10 Factory on Yokohama Bridge, still have no workers resuming work. Party and government agencies met yesterday to discuss disposal measures and decided to convene a mediation meeting in the near future. Regardless of whether representatives from both sides attend, a ruling will be announced. If the workers do not resume work, the factory will be allowed to recruit new workers to avoid prolonging the strike.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Rent Reduction Committee Cables Administrative Yuan Requesting Approval of Rent Reduction <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Rent Reduction Committee cabled Director Wang of the Administrative Yuan yesterday, stating: "To Nanjing National Government Administrative Yuan Director Wang: Since China was invaded by Japan, Shanghai has suffered from war and economic decline. Rural areas have gone bankrupt, unemployment has increased, and the market has declined. Shanghai is a densely populated area. Previously, there was a shortage of houses, but this is no longer the case. Many houses are empty. The reason is that the commercial market is sluggish (original text) and housing prices are expensive, which is not enough to maintain livelihood. The economic situation is unprecedented in history. (Omission) Reducing rent will alleviate the burden on the people. With rent reduced, there will be no empty houses, and the market prosperity can be turned around. As in the case of the rent reduction in the capital, which was approved by the Central Political Committee and promulgated by your Yuan, the Shanghai rent reduction measures should also be approved by your Yuan as soon as possible to stabilize society and maintain the people's livelihood. The telegram is urgent. Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee bows and salutes."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Social Bureau and Others Convened Silk Factory Businessmen Yesterday to Discuss Relief Measures; Instructed Both Sides to Report the Details of the Decline <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>China's silk industry has been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk in the European and American markets. The market price of Chinese silk has been falling sharply, resulting in huge losses for silk factories and workers. Silk factory owners and workers have requested relief from the Ministry of Industry and other departments. The Municipal Social Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Industry through the municipal government, ordering it to discuss and formulate a relief plan. It specially convened a meeting with representatives from both labor and management of silk factories in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Peishen of the Shanghai Silk Factory Owners' Association, Yang Gengti, Yuan Yunlong, and Chen Xiupu of the 4th and 6th District Silk Reeling Workers' Union, and representatives from the Municipal Party Department and the Ministry of Finance attended the meeting to handle the matter together. Wang Gang, director of the Huigong Section of the Social Bureau, chaired the meeting. After the chairman questioned both sides, he instructed them to report the current situation in detail so that a relief plan could be decided upon.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Duck Industry Experiences Market Suspension Crisis; Chicken and Duck Dealers Arbitrarily Changed the Three-Seven Foreign Exchange Rate; Telegrams Sent to Various Ports to Stop Loading Ducks to Shanghai <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai chicken and duck industry and the duck slaughtering industry have experienced a market suspension dispute due to the issue of three-seven foreign exchange rate payment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Dispute: Duck slaughterers purchase ducks from chicken and duck dealers and pay for them with 30 yuan of corner silver for every 100 yuan (10 corners equal one yuan), which is the so-called three-seven foreign exchange rate. This has been used for more than 30 years. In 1930, there was a dispute, which was later resolved by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau convening representatives from the two industry associations to sign a commercial dispute settlement record. The record was divided into two articles: (1) Except for the Nandefeng and Xinchangshun chicken and duck dealers, which all use silver dollars, the other dealers will still use the three-seven foreign exchange rate calculation, because the Nandefeng and Xinchangshun dealers have open spaces in their stores where they can store ducks, allowing vendors to buy and slaughter them at any time, which is more convenient than other dealers who need to feed the ducks. (2) After the settlement case is signed, if any members of the industry do not comply, the two industry associations may jointly decide on measures to ban them in a joint meeting and submit them to the Social Bureau for record and implementation. After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the chicken and duck dealers changed to collecting money in silver dollars. At that time, the duck slaughterers sent representatives to negotiate with the association, but it was ineffective. They submitted a request to the Municipal Social Bureau for mediation, but there was no result. Therefore, they convened a members' meeting on April 8 to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Triggering the Crisis: The meeting concluded by requesting the Chicken and Duck Association to show mutual aid and love and continue to sell at the three-seven foreign exchange rate. However, the Chicken and Duck Association replied that the customer did not agree and could not comply. Moreover, those chicken and duck dealers who were willing to sell at the three-seven foreign exchange rate were stopped by Zhao Songge, chairman of the Chicken and Duck Association, and telegrams were sent to various ports north of the Yangtze River to stop loading ducks to Shanghai. Those that had already been loaded and shipped to Shanghai were also ordered to be loaded back onto the original ships. As a result, duck slaughterers were forced to suspend business, and the crisis expanded.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Machine Industry Association Cables Administrative Yuan Requesting That the Authorities Deal with Factory Inspections; Asks the Municipal Government to Urge a Prompt Protest <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession's Industry and Construction Board recently suddenly inspected the Hongxing Hosiery Factory and demanded a factory inspection fee of 70 yuan, causing a backlash from various domestic goods factories. The Machine Industry Association believes that this matter concerns national sovereignty. In addition to submitting separate protests to the Municipal Government and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, it also cabled the Administrative Yuan yesterday, stating: "To Nanjing Administrative Yuan: We have recently received a letter from our member, Hongxing Hosiery Factory, stating that on the 6th of this month, the French Concession Health Bureau sent personnel accompanied by the Fire Department, carrying machinery, to inspect our factory's boiler, injecting 120 pounds of cold pressure. The result was deemed satisfactory, and they left. Unexpectedly, a notice was sent today stating that our factory should pay a total of 70 yuan in inspection fees and other expenses annually, which is very surprising. The factory believes that this matter concerns the entire initiative of the factory, and the factory should not rashly set a precedent, etc., and attached a copy (photo) of the French notice to the association. It is found that the issue of factory inspection rights in the Shanghai Concession has not yet been resolved, and the French Concession authorities are using their power and influence to oppress factories and demand payment of inspection fees. If they refuse to pay, they are weak and powerless. If they reluctantly pay, it concerns the entire national sovereignty. The factory is in a畸形 state, and it is difficult to advance or retreat. Although the association is a legal industrial and commercial group, it is our duty to protect the factories of our members, but we still need to rely on the Yuan to hold a strong position and urge the municipal government to file a protest as soon as possible so that the strength is sufficient to withdraw the factory inspection fee and avoid losing sovereignty. In addition to cabling the Ministry of Industry and submitting a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government for a protest, and sending a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession for negotiation, we especially cable the Yuan for consideration and order compliance. The situation of last year's protest by the association against the Public Concession authorities ordering factories to improve and relocate is detailed in the book 'Industrial Safety and Management,' which is sent separately. Please review. Shanghai Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factory United Association bows."</p>

<p>New tea produced in the mountains of Zhejiang's Hangzhou and surrounding areas has now entered the market. It is packaged into basket tea or wrapped tea and transported to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway by various transport companies. This has always been a large volume. It is now known that the sample tea of the first batch of new tea (green leaves packed in baskets) was loaded onto freight cars at Nanxing Bridge yesterday and unloaded at the South Station, totaling dozens of baskets. These will be delivered separately by the China Transport Company. It is verified that this green tea is sold to the domestic population. However, large quantities of basket tea and wrapped tea will not be transported to Shanghai by the Railway Bureau until the middle of next month. In addition, the top-quality black tea produced in Zhejiang and Anhui provinces is selected and packed in boxes specifically for sale overseas (Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, etc., with Russia having the widest sales, reaching hundreds of thousands of boxes each year). These box teas are expected to arrive in Shanghai around mid-May. The Railway Bureau has a special agreement with Huitong and Mao Shuntai companies, contracting them for transportation at special prices, handling at least 200,000 boxes each year.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Dongjiadu Ferry Operators Self-Managing Ferry Services: A Summary from the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, Why Must the Xingye Trust Company Compete? <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association submitted a summary to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government regarding the Dongjiadu ferry operators raising funds to self-manage ferry services. The document reads: "Respectfully summarizing, this association previously received a letter from the Dongjiadu ferry industry requesting that the Municipal Government be asked to allow the original ferry operators to raise funds to self-manage the improvement of ferry services. This was submitted by this association, but was not approved. The ferry operators, fearing that they would be unemployed and lose their livelihoods, submitted another request. I, Yong, with respect for my hometown, which has always been valued, must speak on behalf of my fellow villagers to our Party Department and Mayor. In my humble opinion, it is more appropriate and proper for Dongjiadu to be managed by the original ferry operators raising funds. Let me explain the reasons: The purpose of improving ferry services is to facilitate the public. If this purpose can be achieved, it is acceptable for the city to manage it, and even more acceptable for the people to manage it. If the Dongjiadu ferry must be managed by the Xingye Trust Company, disregarding the original ferry operators, it would appear to be using political power to compete with the people for profit. This is the first reason. Under party rule, the government aims to implement the Three Principles of the People, and the Principle of People's Livelihood is one of the Three Principles. Administrators should always consider this. If the Dongjiadu ferry must be managed by the Xingye Trust Company, hundreds of families who directly or indirectly depend on the original ferry operators for their livelihoods will become unemployed, which is contrary to the Principle of People's Livelihood. This is the second reason. According to the regulations on supervising privately-operated public utilities promulgated by the National Government, and the ferry regulations promulgated by the Municipal Government, privately-operated ferries are not absolutely prohibited. This applies even to newly established businesses. The Dongjiadu ferry industry, which has a history of hundreds of years, should be allowed to convert to ferry services. From a legal perspective, there is no conflict. This is the third reason. When the Municipal Government manages municipal affairs, using its own power results in small achievements, while using the power of the people results in great achievements. Since the original ferry operators are willing to raise funds to self-manage the Dongjiadu ferry, granting them permission would be a good use of the people's power, making it easier for municipal public utilities to develop. This is the fourth reason. The government should focus on major and long-term issues. The navigation rights of our country are mostly controlled by foreigners, and recovering them for self-management is a major and long-term issue. The Dongjiadu ferry is a minor and short-term issue. If the people have the ability to self-manage it, then let them do so, and the Xingye Trust Company should focus on major and long-term issues that the people cannot handle. This is the fifth reason. The government is the government of the people, and the Party Department announces to the citizens that all citizens should hear it together. The government is the government of the people. Any measure that benefits the people should be implemented even if it has not been formally approved. Conversely, any measure that is detrimental to the people should be revised even if it has been formally approved. If the Dongjiadu ferry is transferred to the Xingye Trust Company, hundreds of families who directly or indirectly depend on it for their livelihoods will become unemployed, which is greatly detrimental to the people. Although the Municipal Government has approved the company's proposal, the ferry operators' petition has been pending for a long time. The documents are available for review. Moreover, the people's ferry is to facilitate the people's travel, and the ferry for the people's travel should be allowed to be self-managed by the people. The Trust Company should have many other businesses to manage, so why must it compete for this? Changing course for profit is a common practice for politicians. This is the sixth reason. The Dongjiadu ferry industry dates back to the eighth year of the Shunzhi reign of the former Qing Dynasty, lasting hundreds of years. Hundreds of families, and thousands of men, women, and children, directly or indirectly depend on it for their livelihoods. It has a long history and a broad impact. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, Huang Zihe, who had no historical connection with Dongjiadu, petitioned to take over the management and was approved. Now, the original ferry operators, who have a history of hundreds of years with Dongjiadu, are requesting to self-manage it, but are being denied permission. In terms of reason and sentiment, how can this be considered fair? This is the seventh reason. The Municipal Government approved the association's submission, stating that after the Xingye Trust Company manages the Dongjiadu ferry, it will still allow the ferry industry to operate in consideration of the ferry industry. From the surface, it seems to be taking everything into consideration, but in reality, it will result in mutual damage. The lesson of Qingning Temple is still fresh. If the operation is still allowed, why not just improve it? The Trust Company can also avoid some losses. Some may say that the weak ferry operators, with their old-fashioned ferries, cannot compete with the powerful Xingye Trust Company and its modern ferries. This kind of approach is nominally considerate, but actually ridiculous. It is not a groundless worry. The government should set an example for the people and should not do this. This is the eighth reason. Some may say that after the Xingye Trust Company manages the ferry, the original Dongjiadu ferry workers can still be employed. However, this approach can only save a portion of the ferry workers and cannot save most of the ferry operators. Even for the small number of rescued ferry workers, the power of hiring and firing is in the hands of others, and the foundation is not secure, causing great concern. This is the ninth reason. The Xingye Trust Company was established using a portion of the Reconstruction Public Bonds. Its mission should be to rebuild Zhabei, which was destroyed by the violent Japanese, in order to fulfill the purpose of establishing the company. Now, without hearing any plans for the reconstruction of Zhabei, it is first plotting to seize the livelihood of the Dongjiadu ferry industry, so that those who want to revitalize the people's business are instead destroying the people's business. Isn't this contrary to the true purpose of establishing the company? This is the tenth reason. In summary of the above reasons, I sincerely request the Party Department and the Mayor to accept the opinions of the ferry operators of the original ferry, allow them to raise funds to self-manage, emphasize the people's livelihood, and conform to party rule. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Mayor Wu, Du Yong, Chairman of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, April 13, Year 23."</p>

<p>Yesterday at 9:15 AM, a fire broke out in the home of Gu Liansheng, a native of Zhoushan, who lived in the front building at No. 2 Yifeng Lane, Lane 123, Menghua Lou Street, Nanshi. Gu was unfortunately out at the time. Only his wife, Ms. Lin, his eldest son, Changgen (15 years old), his youngest son, Gendi, and his three-year-old daughter, Baogen, were at home. Fortunately, Changgen had already gone to school an hour earlier. Ms. Lin and her second son and youngest daughter went out shopping. By the time they returned home, the fire had spread and was beyond control. Zhao Xu, a resident of the rear building, had a daughter married to Wu Ronglin, and they lived together. Wu had a daughter named Meidi, who was only two years old. At the time, due to the intense fire, the whole family jumped out of the window to escape, but Meidi could not be carried out and eventually perished in the flames. Firefighters from various districts in Nanshi were alerted and rushed to the scene to put out the fire, fortunately preventing it from spreading to neighboring houses. The fire was quickly extinguished. Police from the 2nd Precinct of the 2nd District arrived at the scene and took the arsonist into custody. The child was pulled out, but was already a charred corpse. Chief Tang ordered the local leader, Jiang Pingyang, to report to the District Court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Yang and others, commissioned to perform the autopsy, clarified the cause of death and instructed the family to collect the body and wait for the arsonist to be brought to justice.</p>

<p>Wu Dongsheng, a native of Ningbo, 36 years old, who lived at No. 71 Guanxi Pavilion in the city and worked as a dock laborer, was sound asleep at 10:30 PM the night before last. For some unknown secret reason, he had a feud with Chen Youxing, a Shaoxing native (37 years old, also a laborer) who lived with him. Seeing Wu asleep, Chen took a kitchen knife and slashed Wu Dongsheng's head and right arm twice, then fled, abandoning the knife. Wu fell bleeding. After neighbors discovered the incident, they urgently called Li Gengchen of the 21st Precinct, who arrested Chen Youxing. Wu Dongsheng was found barely alive and unable to speak. He was immediately hired a car and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, there were concerns about his life. Chen Youxing was handed over to the precinct. After questioning by Chief Liu, Chen Youxing confessed that he had no feud with Wu Dongsheng and that he was instigated to commit the crime by Lu Quansheng, a native of Ningbo, who lived at No. 47 Guanyin Pavilion. Chief Liu then arrested Lu Quansheng. After questioning, Lu Quansheng denied the allegations, claiming that Chen Youxing was trying to implicate him because Chen Youxing had been slapped by Lu. Subsequently, Lu Quansheng's uncle, Fu Amao, went to the precinct to testify, proving that Chen Youxing was falsely implicating Lu Quansheng due to a feud. However, the cause of the initial conflict and the true facts remained unclear, making the case confusing. As the case involved injury, all the witnesses and the murder weapon were sent to the District Court for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Murder Case at the Zhabei Theater: Caused by the Installation of a Poison Device, the Murderer Didn't Escape After the Axeing <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 3:30 PM, while the audience was absorbed in the performance at the Zhabei Theater at the intersection of Datong Road and Mongolia Road in Zhabei, a spectator in the third seat of the fourth row on the ground floor was suddenly struck twice on the head with a woodcutter's axe by someone behind him. The injured person immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The audience stood up in alarm, and the timid ran out, causing chaos. The performance was immediately stopped. When the theater staff arrived and inquired, the murderer was still standing beside him with the axe and did not flee. The theater staff immediately seized the axe and called Zhang Qingjie, a policeman from the 7th Post of the 4th District Public Security Bureau, who took the murderer and the axe to the district. The injured person was hired a car by theater staff member Li Chongshan and sent to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road in the concession for treatment. After arriving at the district, the murderer claimed to be Ni Heshang, 26 years old, a native of Changzhou, who lived in the kitchen shed at No. 18 Faxiang Lane, Datong Road. The injured person was Lu Gensheng, a native of Nanxiang, around 20 years old. One month ago, he and Lu rented the kitchen shed at No. 18 Faxiang Lane to set up a device for selling red pills. Due to poor security, they were arrested by the Public Security Bureau's detective team, but Lu escaped. Later, the Public Security Bureau released me after I was imprisoned for six days, because I was not the main culprit. Because I didn't have money to do business, I borrowed ten yuan at a high interest rate. Today, because the rent was due, I not only pawned my pawn (and showed the pawn ticket) for one yuan and six angles to pay the interest, but he also moved away the utensils and my clothes in the house. This person is very fierce, and I can't deal with him. If I don't kill him, I will surely die in his hands in the future. After investigating, it was found that the kitchen shed at No. 18 Faxiang Lane not only sold red pills, but also provided people for smoking opium. The interrogating officer ordered that the suspect and the weapon be sent to the Zhabei Judicial Branch of the Public Security Bureau for handling, and that an investigation be conducted to determine whether the injured Lu Gensheng was in danger of losing his life. Later, Baolong Hospital reported that the injured man's skull was shattered, and there were fears that his life could not be saved.</p>
<h3 id="e156">How Can a Woman Marry Two Men? Miss Yu Si from Jiangbei Comes to Shanghai to Remarry; Her Original Husband Finds Her and She is Found Guilty <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yu Si, a woman from Bentuo Town, Dongtai, Jiangbei, was betrothed by her parents to Miao Zhu from the same town when she was six years old. At that time, she became a child bride. Ten years passed, and Yu's parents passed away one after another, while Miao and others had also grown up. Miao, now 28 years old, worked as a farmer, while Yu was 18 years old. They held a wedding in their hometown on the 18th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar last year. The couple's relationship was initially very harmonious, but recently, Yu, because she disliked her husband's poverty and was incited by her brother, Yu Shanqing, harbored ulterior motives. On the 3rd day of the second month of the lunar calendar this year, Yu's grandmother passed away due to illness. Miao's father sent Yu Si back to her mother's home. Yu never returned and disappeared without a trace. Although Miao searched nearby, he found nothing and had to ask people everywhere to inquire, hoping to get her back. Little did he know that Yu had already harbored wicked intentions. On the 18th day of the third month, she and her brother conspired with Wang Rusong, a fellow villager, to come to Shanghai by boat to marry Chen Lanpu, a man from Jiangbei. Chen was 27 years old and ran a bicycle rental shop at No. 414 Qipu Road. He had not yet married. Because he knew Wang Rusong, Wang acted as a matchmaker for Yu Si, falsely claiming that she was not yet engaged. At that time, it was agreed that the betrothal gift would be 120 yuan, with 80 yuan paid in advance. Chen, unaware that the woman was already married, chose an auspicious day, the 25th day of the second month, to formally marry her at the Dali Restaurant on Tiantong Road, and they lived together in the shop on Qipu Road. However, less than ten days later, the matter was discovered by her original husband, Miao Zhuqing, who tracked her down to Shanghai. At 3 PM yesterday, he went directly to Chen's house on Qipu Road and found his runaway wife, intending to take her back. However, Yu Si denied that Miao was her husband, claiming not to know him. At the same time, the matchmaker, Wang Rusong, happened to be at the scene, leading to a conflict. It was discovered by a Chinese constable from the 19th Precinct, who took both parties to the Huizi Police Station. After learning the details, Chinese detective Zhuge Huan ordered Yu and Wang Rusong to be detained separately. This morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, stated the above situation, saying that Yu was being prosecuted for bigamy under Article 254 of the Criminal Law, and Wang was being prosecuted for assisting in bigamy. He requested a judgment in accordance with the law. Subsequently, Miao Zhuqing filed a case, stating that Yu was his wife and had secretly fled in February this year. He had only just found her yesterday and requested to take her back, presenting a red wedding invitation. Yu was questioned and admitted everything, declaring that she did not want to go home with Miao. Wang Rusong's testimony was cunning, claiming that he did not know Yu Si already had a husband. The police lawyer, Gan, stated that this matter was entirely conspired by Wang Rusong and Yu's brother, Yu Shanqing, and should be severely punished according to the law. Judge Liu Yugui ruled in court that Miao Yu Si was guilty of bigamy and sentenced her to six months of imprisonment. Wang Rusong was guilty of assisting in bigamy and sentenced him to six months of imprisonment. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day.</p>

<p>The reprinting of the Song Dynasty Qishasha Edition of the Great Buddhist Canon, which had previously suffered a major disaster, is now underway. The first batch of 50 volumes of scriptures has been published, consisting of a total of 329 works, 616 scrolls, which were engraved during the Duanping, Jiaxi, and Chunyou periods. In the cultural history of our country, and in the version studies of the Buddhist canon, due to economic constraints, only 500 copies were printed.

<h3 id="e158">Completion of the Qiu Jiang Pier Limited to Three Years <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: In order to promote the construction of Greater Shanghai and prosper the new urban area, the Shanghai Municipal Government plans to develop the Qiu Jiang Pier. All surveying work has been completed, and the Municipal Central District Construction Committee has resolved to complete all construction within three years. The land was purchased by the Central Bank and will be discussed with the Municipal Government for construction. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Qiu Jiang Pier to be Completed in Three Years, planned to be built at the mouth of Qiu Jiang in Yinhang District, has been planned for a long time and has already been surveyed. Since the Municipal Government moved to the central district, the Municipal Government has become more active in the construction of this pier. The Municipal Central District Construction Committee has resolved to complete it within three years. The Municipal Government previously intended to invite merchants to contract the project, although some respondents went to negotiate, but no agreement was reached. According to reporter investigations, the Central Bank intends to invest in the construction, but has not yet contacted the Municipal Government, so whether it can become a reality is still unknown.</p>
<p>Central Bank Purchases Land The land was originally private property, with a company named China Enterprise Company occupying more than 800 acres. The Municipal Government, in order to build the pier, had to requisition private land. To avoid disputes, it announced that the land could not be transferred. However, fearing that disputes would arise during requisition in the future, it agreed with the Central Bank to purchase the land. According to the Central Bank, the land price has been paid in full, and it will apply to the Municipal Government for a business license soon for the transfer. The land now belongs to the Central Bank. The Municipal Government has ordered the Land, Public Works, and Construction Bureaus to contact the Central Bank on matters related to the construction of the Qiu Jiang Pier.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Completion of the Central District Telephone Exchange Expected by the End of September: Expensive Telephone Rates in Pudong, Users Oppose Again; All Cross-Border Machines to be Completely Removed This Year <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, telephone rates have been higher than in other districts due to the river-crossing lines. Local residents are dissatisfied with this. All cross-border telephones in the concession area will be completely removed this year. The reconstruction of the Longhua exchange is expected to be completed by mid-May. The Central District Exchange is expected to be completed in September. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Opposition Rises Again Since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau established the Pudong Branch at the end of November last year, the prices set for telephones have been more expensive than in other districts, such as the north and south cities, Wusong, Zhenru, Longhua, Jiangwan, because of river-crossing water lines. (The monthly fee for residents in the north and south districts is 7 yuan, and 10 yuan for shops, while the monthly fee for residents in Pudong is 12 yuan, and 15 yuan for shops.) Lei Shi had been opposed by all circles in the area. The Telephone Bureau had requested instructions from the Ministry of Communications, and the result was that it still charged according to the fixed price because of the water lines. Unexpectedly, the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association also opposed it recently because of the high price. It is now known that the Telephone Bureau is still waiting for the Ministry of Communications to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Removal of Cross-Border Machines As for the telephones of the Concession Telephone Company that cross the border and are installed in the districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, Dianru, Wusong, Longhua, Jiangwan, and Pudong, the total number is 288. Except for the 78 machines in Pudong District, which were removed in February after the establishment of the branch, the Telephone Bureau has removed more than 30 machines based on the temporary contract. At that time, because the Telephone Bureau canceled the five-cent call fee, the No. 0 manual station connected to the concession was suddenly busy. Fearing that the removal would cause obstacles to telephone services, it was planned to expand the No. 0 station before removal. It is now known that the manual station equipment will begin to be expanded in May, and all cross-border machines will be removed one after another this year.</p>
<p>New Machines in Longhua There were originally more than 80 exchange machines in Longhua. Because the city is becoming increasingly prosperous and the original machines are old and insufficient, the Ministry of Communications ordered 150 of the most modern automatic telephone machines. Since the dismantling and installation began last month, the assembly project has been largely completed. However, due to the continuous rain in the past few days, the outdoor lines could not be installed. Yesterday, Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer of the Telephone Bureau, told reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency that all projects can be completed on May 10. After the line is tested, the official call period must be extended to around May 20.</p>
<p>Central District After the Municipal Government moved to the central district on New Year's Day in order to plan for the prosperity of Greater Shanghai, the Ministry of Communications believed that prosperity in the city was most important. Therefore, it had purchased five acres of land in the urban area to build a branch. At that time, due to procedural relations, it could not be established early. Therefore, all telephones in the central district are transferred from Zhabei. Dong Ruihua Architects have won the bid to build the branch and have started filling the soil. In order to establish the branch as soon as possible, the Telephone Bureau has limited the completion date to the end of September.</p>

<p>The Chinese Benevolent Children's Association held its 63rd Executive Committee meeting at the Bankers' Association a few days ago. Those present included Kong Xiangxi, Luo Yunyan, Fei Meide, Lin Kanghou, Sun Ruihuang, Ying Shi, Le Lingsheng, Zhao Jinqing, Fei Wusheng, Hu Mengjia, Wu Weide, Li Ting'an, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jianping, Wang Guanyi, and over twenty others. In addition to the routine reports and discussions, this meeting particularly focused on the issue of commemorating the late Executive Committee member, Mrs. Ke Yinhun. The meeting began with Chairman Kong Xiangxi leading everyone in standing silently in mourning for three minutes. He then delivered a eulogy, saying that Mrs. Ke Yinhun had been in China for many years, was enthusiastic about public welfare, and recently took a special interest in benevolent children's causes and provided assistance in many ways. Unfortunately, heaven did not grant her a long life, and she passed away suddenly, and her colleagues mourned her greatly. To fulfill her unfinished benevolent will and to commemorate her past contributions, it was proposed to raise $6,000 to build a memorial hall at the Jiangwan Yeyuan Children's Sanatorium to cherish her memory forever. Everyone unanimously approved the proposal and resolved that the association would advance $6,000 to start construction before the funds were raised and that construction would proceed immediately. Xu Jianping, Wang Guanyi, and others, together with Dr. Yan Fuqing, the director-general of the Shanghai Medical Affairs Enterprise Board, decided on the architectural drawings and planned the steps for implementation. In addition to publicizing the plan in newspapers, separate letters will be sent to Chinese friends and acquaintances to solicit donations for the Ke Yinhun Memorial Hall building fund. It is reported that the architectural style of this hall will be Chinese with scientific equipment. If the construction cost exceeds $6,000, additional funds will be sought. The sanatorium will have both medical and educational departments so that impoverished children suffering from lung disease, tuberculosis, and rickets will not only receive medical treatment during their convalescence but also enjoy educational activities. At the same time, the sanatorium is located in the southernmost part of Yeyuan, facing the water and nestled against the mountains, with a superior environment where convalescing children can enjoy beautiful scenery, experience pleasant sensations, promote health, and benefit from education. This is a groundbreaking endeavor in the field of children's welfare and an outstanding memorial hall.</p>

<p>The popularity of domestic cigarettes is due to the improvements in their quality. The enthusiasm in promoting them has also facilitated the development of China's cigarette industry today. The Shanghai banking community has recently made it their mission to support Chinese industry, and they use domestic products as much as possible for daily necessities. Even for cigarettes, a necessity for social interactions, they all use Chinese cigarettes as the standard. Recently, when the China National Goods Bank moved to its new building, the cigarettes used to entertain guests and for self-use were all "Guanghua" brand Chinese standard cigarettes manufactured by Huamei Tobacco Company. Major banks such as the Bank of China, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Chekiang Industrial Bank, and others also consistently use Chinese cigarettes. With such strong support from the banking community, the future of China's cigarette industry looks bright and promising.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Emergency Joint Meeting of Silk and Electrical Machinery Industry Associations Yesterday Regarding the Detention of Domestic Silk Products in Guangzhou <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Association learned that domestic intertwined silk products shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong by Guangdong Zhongxing Company were detained and classified as foreign goods requiring special taxes. Despite the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce providing additional proof, the goods were still not released, and over 3,000 bolts of silk were detained. As a result, Guangdong merchants have been sending telegrams to halt the shipment of domestic silk, causing great panic. Therefore, yesterday, the association, together with the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Factory Association, held an emergency joint meeting, inviting representatives from the Guangdong Silk and Cloth Industry Association to attend and discuss solutions. Over twenty people attended, including Lou Fengshao, Tu Shenying, Zhang Hongsun, Lu Zhengbing, Cao Zhixiang, Wu Xingcha, Shao Maozhang, Wu Zhihao, Pan Runsheng, Shen Ji'en, Xi Gongshi, Gao Shiheng, Qian Jixi, Wu Qinxuan, Zhu Yiliang, Chen Yusheng, Deng Hanchen, Lu Shunchou, Lei Songpan, and Chen Depei. Lu Zhengbing served as chairman, and Li Boheng recorded the minutes. After the chairman reported on the detention of goods in Guangzhou, all agreed that the Guangdong Zhongxing Company was established to collect special taxes on foreign cloth and that the domestic silk products, manufactured in domestic factories and conforming to the fourth-class domestic product standard promulgated by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, were completely unrelated. However, the company forced the issue and deliberately made things difficult. If they did not fight hard, the day of factory closures and business shutdowns would be imminent. It was resolved to send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting them to send telegrams to the Central Party, government departments, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, and the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department, asking them to order Zhongxing Company to release all the detained domestic silk products as soon as possible to maintain the domestic silk business. Pan Runsheng and Lou Fengshao from the silk industry, Gao Shiheng and Qian Boxi from the electrical machinery industry, and Chen Yusheng, Deng Hanchen, and Chen Weihan from the Guangdong silk and cloth industry were immediately appointed as representatives to bring petitions to Beijing and Guangdong, vowing to fight for their rights. It is reported that the representatives are scheduled to depart tomorrow, first going to the capital.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Reinstatement of Special Tax on Pisi <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Shanghai Pisi Tobacco Industry Association, document number Shui Zi 196, on the 13th of this month, stating: "We hereby inform you that after the Fujian Incident occurred in November of last year, all native tobacco leaves and their processed tobacco silk from that province, transported into the special tax zone of the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, were subject to the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. These regulations stipulated that the first special tax authority at the point of entry should collect the special tax, issue a tax payment certificate, and affix a stamp to the packages before they could be transported to Shanghai. This department has previously informed your association of these regulations. Now that the Fujian Rebellion has been quelled, the Fujian Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau has reported that it has taken over the local areas of the province, except for the Ting and Long prefectures, where banditry has not subsided. The bureau has dispatched personnel to take over the various sub-bureaus and supervise the implementation of the native tobacco special tax. The Ministry of Finance has approved that since the various prefectures in the province have resumed the special tax system, all native tobacco leaves and tobacco silk from that province that have paid the special tax should be allowed to pass through the special tax zone of each province upon presentation of the tax payment certificate or shipping permit, with a stamp affixed to the package, after inspection by the relevant special tax authority. This will restore the original situation and benefit commercial transportation. As for the Ting and Long prefectures, where banditry has not subsided and the bureau has not yet dispatched personnel to take over, the method of supplementary tax payment should be restored when native tobacco leaves and tobacco silk from these two prefectures are transported into the special tax zone to maintain tax administration. In October of last year, your association stated that the tobacco silk produced in the Yongding area of Ting prefecture, transported from Shantou to Shanghai, and shipped by post from the place of origin or Guangdong province into the special tax zone, was first subject to a tobacco silk tax of 2 yuan per package (equivalent to 100 small packages weighing 67 market catties net) by local authorities in the Yongding area, such as the Post-War Relief Branch and the 7th District Tobacco and Alcohol Inspection Branch and its subordinate agencies (after deducting additional taxes and surcharges). The native tobacco leaf special tax was not fully paid. Later, when requesting supplementary payment of the special tax, it was calculated at 4 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen per 100 market catties. As for the original tobacco silk tax, it was requested that the evidence be verified and the refund be approved. This tax refund should be used to offset the special tax due, limited to 2 yuan per 67 market catties. If there is no such evidence, the full 4 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen per 100 market catties should be collected in accordance with the regulations. Four measures were drafted and submitted to the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau for review and transfer. This department temporarily approved the implementation of these measures and ordered compliance. Before the Ting and Long prefectures are taken over for special taxes, all native tobacco leaves and tobacco silk from these two prefectures transported into the special tax zone may temporarily be subject to supplementary special tax collection by the relevant special tax authority in accordance with the above measures. Tax payments already made at the place of origin are also allowed to be offset against the special tax upon verification of the original tax certificate, limited to 2 yuan per 67 market catties. However, tax certificates issued by pseudo-agencies during the Fujian Incident shall not be valid for offsetting. The special tax offsetting situation should be clearly noted on the back of each copy of the tax payment certificate by the issuing agency, and the original tax certificate should be attached to the tax payment certificate for verification and submitted together in accordance with the prescribed procedures to ensure accuracy. All of the above should be complied with. This letter is hereby issued for your information, and it is hoped that it will be relayed to all members of the association. In the future, when encountering Fujian tobacco silk being transported to Shanghai, except for tobacco silk produced in the Ting and Long prefectures and transported from Shantou or by post to Shanghai, the previous method of supplementary tax payment and tax refund should be applied. For tobacco silk transported from the special tax zone of the province, merchants should fill out an application form, together with the original and duplicate copies of the yellow declaration form, and submit them to the department for verification. The original yellow declaration form will be endorsed with a stamp and returned to the merchant, who can then declare and release the goods.

<p>According to the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, the recent status of trade between Yokohama and China is as follows: (1) In January of this year, the port of Yokohama exported 35 kinds of goods to mainland China, the three eastern provinces, and Dalian, valued at 4,900,145 Japanese yen. The statistics for goods exported to the three regions are as follows: Exports to mainland China were valued at 648,263 Japanese yen, with electric wires, machinery, and iron being the main commodities, followed by refined sugar and other miscellaneous goods. The three items of electric wires, machinery, and iron were valued at 102,291 Japanese yen, accounting for one-sixth of the total export value. Exports to the three eastern provinces were valued at 318,292 Japanese yen, with wheat flour being the main commodity, followed by machinery and iron. Wheat flour was valued at 109,573 Japanese yen, accounting for one-third of the total export value. Exports to Dalian consisted mainly of wheat flour, copper, iron, electrical machinery, and refined sugar, totaling 3,933,590 Japanese yen. Wheat flour was valued at 1,131,408 Japanese yen, accounting for one-third of the total export value. Comparing the total value of exports to the three regions, Dalian accounted for nine-tenths of the total export value. (2) A total of 35 kinds of goods were imported from mainland China, the three eastern provinces, and Dalian to Yokohama, valued at 5,508,649 Japanese yen. The statistics for goods imported from the three regions are as follows: Imports from mainland China consisted mainly of cotton, cowhide, and tin, followed by coal, hemp, and other miscellaneous goods, totaling 2,006,152 Japanese yen. Cotton was valued at 684,444 Japanese yen, accounting for three-tenths of the total export value. Imports from the three eastern provinces consisted mainly of soybean cake, iron, and coal, followed by small beans, sesame, and other miscellaneous goods, totaling 3,325,426 Japanese yen. Soybean was valued at 997,584 Japanese yen, accounting for one-third of the total export value. Imports from Dalian mainly consisted of crude salt, followed by old iron, valued at 177,071 Japanese yen. Crude salt was valued at 45,773 Japanese yen, accounting for one-third of the total export value. Comparing the total value of exports from the three regions, the three eastern provinces accounted for the largest share, accounting for six-tenths of the total export value. (3) Trade between Yokohama and mainland China has declined, while trade with the three eastern provinces and Dalian has surged. Due to the deteriorating international relations between China and Japan in recent years, the export of goods to mainland China remains stagnant, and imports from China to Yokohama have not increased significantly. However, trade with the three eastern provinces and Dalian has developed exceptionally well. Most of the purchasing power is controlled by Japanese merchants, and most of the trade in Yokohama is exports to the United States and South America, with only a small amount of trade with Japan. Under the current circumstances, it is expected that trade between Yokohama and mainland China will remain difficult to develop.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News yesterday, the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that Japan's trade last month showed exports of 175 million yen and imports exceeding 31 million yen. Since January, accumulated imports have exceeded 65 million yen, a decrease of 61% compared to the previous year. Among them, exports to China in March were 9.66 million, while the same period last year had a surplus of 3 million. Since January, the accumulated import surplus has been 2.13 million yen.</p>
<h3 id="e168">The 蒲滙塘 Dike Has Been Built Yesterday <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The 蒲滙塘 (Pu Hui Tang) in western Shanghai has been neglected for years and is severely silted. Previously, the 94-year-old elder Ma Xiangbo and others initiated a proposal to the War Zone Relief Commission to allocate funds for dredging and building a dike at the Tianyaoqiao Bridge in Xujiahui to permanently block the flow of black water westward. A new channel was dug southward in Xiaozha to connect the Caoghejing River, leading out through Longhua Baibukou and reaching the Xepu River. The entire project was completed last autumn. However, the eastern half of the sixth section (from the eastern end of Zhongshan Bridge, at the pailouwan, eastward to Tianyaoqiao Bridge in Xujiahui) has not been dredged due to lack of funds. The Public Works Bureau has contracted Wang Rongji to carry out the work. Yesterday, he instructed the foreman Liu Renji to supervise the workers in building the dike at the pailouwan. Today, they will begin pumping water, and excavation is expected to begin one week later. It is estimated that the dredging of this section will be completed by the end of next month.</p>

<p>Film star Hu Die signed a contract with the Huanan Chemical Industry Company to use her photograph as a trademark for cosmetics. Recently, she suddenly regretted the contract, leading to a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court. Ms. Hu lost the case, as previously reported. Ms. Hu, dissatisfied with the judgment, hired lawyers Qin Liankui and Feng Xizui to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Huanan also hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun to defend their case. The Third Branch of the High Court has now announced its verdict, upholding the original judgment. Ms. Hu lost the case again.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Derailment of China General Omnibus Company Trolley on Route 3 <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:20 AM, trolley number 40 on route 3 (i.e., the Circular Route) of the China General Omnibus Company, pulling trailer number 73, fully loaded with passengers, was heading north from the Old West Gate towards the Fangbang Bridge and the Yingshi Memorial Tower. Due to the driver's carelessness, the trolley derailed. Since the road was under construction at that location, the trailer also tilted off the tracks. The passengers were startled and quickly disembarked. The China General Omnibus Company trolleys on routes 2 and 4 were blocked and had to turn around at the Old West Gate. The French Omnibus Company trolleys on routes 3, 5, and 6 also had to turn around at Fangbang Bridge. The company was notified and dispatched workers with lifting equipment to lift the derailed trailer back onto the tracks. It took about two hours to move the derailed vehicles for repairs and restore traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Trial of the Case of Military Officer Li Chao's Wife Accusing His Concubine of Stealing Funds Has Concluded; Li Chao's Condition Has Improved, and It May Be Necessary to Summon Him; Although the Trial Was Concluded Yesterday, the Judgment Has Been Extended <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Military officer Li Chao, formerly employed at the General Headquarters, possesses a large fortune. In the past, when Li went to Japan, he stored the deeds and account books of his assets in a bank safe deposit box. Li kept the key himself, while the seal required for withdrawing items was entrusted to his beloved concubine, Shi Jingxin. Later, Li returned from Japan and soon fell ill, bedridden and in serious condition. Li's wife, Zhou Likai, fearing that her husband's condition might not improve, urgently obtained the key and opened the box at the bank to inspect the stored items. Unexpectedly, the valuable deeds and account books were missing, and assets worth about 200,000 yuan had vanished. After investigation, it was discovered that the concubine, Shi Jingxin, had secretly taken them away. Zhou immediately sued Shi in the Second Special District Court. The trial concluded that the case should be under the jurisdiction of the First Special District Court. The defendant was released on bail of 50,000 yuan and transferred to the First Special Court. After several hearings, the case was continued yesterday afternoon by Judge Huang. According to lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Concession Police, the plaintiff's husband, Li Chao, has shown signs of improvement, and he requested that the trial be suspended until Li recovers and can personally testify. However, this request seemed legally unfounded and should be reviewed. Judge Huang declared that suspending the trial was legally unfounded and difficult to approve. The facts of the case have been investigated and clarified, and the closing arguments should now proceed. The date of the verdict will be extended. If Li Chao fully recovers before the verdict and it is deemed necessary to summon him, the closing arguments may be reopened. Li and Zhou were questioned again, and then both sides presented their closing arguments. The judge adjourned the court and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Xie Dazhong, an Accomplice in the Kidnapping of Qiu Jianfei, Was Arrested <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Guoliang, also known as Jianfei, a local real estate merchant from Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, was kidnapped near Guangxi Road and Hankou Road on July 5, 1930, at approximately 1:00 AM. He was held for ransom in a house at 32 Mingde Lane, Huanlong Road, in the French Concession for about two weeks. His family paid a ransom of 40,000 yuan for his release. Later, the police arrested a suspect named Zhu, who was sent to the First Special District Court and sentenced to life imprisonment last July. Recently, Chinese Detective Shen Chongli and Detective Supervisor Bao Shuji of the Hongkou Police learned that an accomplice, Xie Dazhong (also known as Xuedao), from Anhui Province, was hiding at 13 North Zhejiang Road. They coordinated with Western detectives and secretly went to the address, arrested him, and brought him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Bureau stated that the investigation revealed that the defendant was invited by the convicted Zhu to guard the kidnap victim at the location and was paid 450 yuan afterward. He then fled to Fujian, where he served as a police officer. He had only been in Shanghai for four or five days and was arrested by police detectives. He requested an extension to summon the victim to court for identification. The defendant confessed that a friend named Zhu had asked him to go to the location where the kidnap victim was being held and guard the victim with two other people. He did not know how much the family paid for the ransom. Regarding the 450 yuan he received afterward, he stated that he had 300 taels of opium that he brought from his hometown to Shanghai, which Zhu sold for him. He then went to Fujian, where he joined the militia. He returned home when the Fujian Incident occurred and recently came to Shanghai to seek employment. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered him to be detained and scheduled another hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>A new factory building was being constructed at the Japanese-owned Huafeng Spinning Mill on Yunzao Road, Wusong. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at around 11:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the material room. The flames quickly spread, and the fire was very fierce. The Second Section Fire Brigade of Wusong District drove the fire engines to extinguish the fire, preventing it from spreading to other buildings. However, the material room was completely destroyed, with losses estimated at over 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Tax Office Section Chief Killed by Car, Driver Sentenced to Three Years <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Wang Mo, also known as Bingqing, a 60-year-old Shaoxing native residing at No. 9 Xinmale Lane, Xin Chongqing Road, Malishi Road, Public Concession, served as the Chief of the Document Section in the Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, located in the Jianghai Customs building on the Bund. On the morning of the 22nd of last month, at approximately 9 a.m., Wang left his home and walked to the tram station at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan in the French Concession. He intended to take the number four tram to the Tax Office. As he was about to board the tram, a private car, number 891, owned by a Western doctor named Sheerbakov, driven by the chauffeur Gao Chunsheng, sped from west to east. Unable to avoid the collision, the car struck Wang, causing a head injury. Despite medical treatment, Wang died at Renji Hospital that afternoon. The police transported the body to the coroner's office for examination, and the Second Special Court dispatched personnel to verify the cause of death. Wang's family claimed the body for burial. Meanwhile, the Traffic Department detained the chauffeur Gao Chunsheng and handed him over to the Second Special Court, charging him with manslaughter. The deceased's son, Wang Jiazhen, also hired a lawyer to file a civil suit seeking damages of 30,000 gold yuan. These details were previously reported in the newspapers. After the conclusion of the interrogation, Judge Xiong Huiping of the Criminal Division One Court yesterday sentenced Gao Chunsheng to three years of imprisonment for causing death due to professional negligence. The number of days detained before the judgment is finalized will be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment. The defendant was transferred to the detention center to await further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Zhang Jilan Surrenders and is Detained; Uses False Name to Run School and Forcibly Seizes Land <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jilan, a comprador for the Bank of Taiwan, in the years of the Republic of China 14 and 15, under the pretense of establishing a school, applied to the authorities and was granted permission to seize over 300 acres of farmland in the Yinxiang District of Eastern Shanghai. At the time, he paid a meager official price of two to three hundred yuan, causing thousands of farming households to become destitute and their homes to be reduced to ruins, leading to widespread resentment. As a result, he was exploited by the Japanese, mortgaging the property rights to the Bank of Taiwan for a huge sum, amounting to a staggering three million taels of silver. Now, the land has become a Japanese-owned sports field. After the Nationalist Army settled the Southeast region, the local agricultural and commercial associations reported the matter. Mayor Zhang Dingfan ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest Zhang and hand him over to the court. Later, a major merchant secured his release on bail with a substantial written guarantee. Now, Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying, considering this cunning behavior to be truly despicable, strongly advocated for strict punishment. Therefore, Zhang Jilan was prosecuted for robbery. President Shen of the court assigned Judge Sun of the Criminal Division to pay close attention to the case. A hearing was held once, but Zhang did not appear. The day before yesterday, it was not a scheduled court date, but the lawyer suddenly accompanied Zhang to surrender, and he was subsequently detained. Zhang was quite distraught, but it was too late.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Debate Ends in Gao Xiaochen and Tao Jiaoyao Debt Dispute Case; Stock Inspection is Necessary <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Gao Xiaochen from Xuzhou, previously represented by lawyer Liu Cailiang, filed a case in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court against Tao Jiaoyao from Jiangxi. After the court held two hearings, both times the plaintiff failed to appear in court. The judge, considering the defendant's counterclaim of false accusation, ordered the plaintiff to appear in court in person for further verification. Yesterday was another scheduled hearing, and both parties, each with their legal representatives, arrived at the court to await the trial. Judge Tu Shenjie presided over the trial in the Second Court. First, the plaintiff Gao Xiaochen was questioned regarding his age, origin, residence, and the details of the case. Then, the defendant Tao Jiaoyao was asked if the case could be resolved through amicable relations between the parties. Tao replied that the truth of the matter must be clarified, and he would not be satisfied until the truth was revealed. He claimed that the plaintiff had falsely accused him without reason, and he requested the court to render a fair judgment. At this point, the official debate began. The plaintiff's lawyer, Liu Cailiang, argued that the late Shanghai Police Commissioner Xu Guoliang owed the plaintiff 40,000 yuan. After Xu's death, his family pleaded with the defendant Gao to assume the debt of 20,000 yuan on behalf of Xu and entrusted him to settle the debt. Apart from the 5,000 yuan that had already been paid, the remaining 15,000 yuan was settled by Cao Boshan, who personally handed over two shares of Tongjisheng Salt Company stock worth 15,000 yuan to the plaintiff to offset the debt. At that time, the plaintiff acknowledged the debt and went to the company to verify that there were no errors and canceled the original interest ledger. The plaintiff did not immediately transfer the shares, but shortly afterward, the salt company went bankrupt. When the plaintiff sought repayment from Tao, Tao refused to settle the debt, which clearly constituted fraud. The plaintiff requested that the case be handled in accordance with Article 363, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and that a civil suit be filed to recover the debt. The defendant's lawyers, Luo Jiaheng, Wang Zaoshi, and Li Guozhen, argued that although there was a transfer of debt, the defendant had already offset the debt with the shares of Tongjisheng Salt Company. The middleman, Cao Boshan, and the plaintiff went to Tongjisheng together to verify that there were no errors, and the plaintiff acknowledged and accepted the offset. The plaintiff's failure to transfer the shares at the time was his own fault and had nothing to do with the defendant. Furthermore, this debt dispute was entirely a civil matter and could not be considered a criminal matter in any way. The plaintiff should not have rashly filed a criminal lawsuit, which was a deliberate attempt to damage the defendant's reputation and extort money. Therefore, the defendant filed a counterclaim for false accusation, requesting the court to declare the defendant not guilty, reject the civil lawsuit, and punish the plaintiff Gao Xiaochen for falsely accusing the defendant. At this point, the court decided that the stock issue still needed to be investigated, and announced the suspension of the debate. The debate was rescheduled for May 1, and then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e189">Answering Questions—Answering Mr. Xu Lezhen— <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>We have received several letters from Mr. Xu discussing reading problems with us. We have long admired his eagerness to learn and his willingness to ask questions. However, we are especially pleased with this letter because he not only trusts us and reads the books we recommend, but also extracts the difficulties in the books in great detail and discusses them with us. This kind of knowledge-seeking spirit that does not fear trouble and refuses to be careless is truly rare and valuable, and we should respect and emulate it very much. Therefore, even though the books he has read may not be read by all readers, and the nouns and sentences he does not understand may be understood by readers, and seeing this kind of discussion may feel boring, the main purpose of publishing this letter is not to think that these questions should be raised for discussion, but to hope that readers can imitate his spirit of seeking truth, read books carefully, and be able to discuss the difficult parts of the book with us in such a concrete way. If the number of letters like this increases in the future, then we will choose a book that is indeed a good book and a general reading material, and the difficulties raised are more likely to be encountered by general readers, and publish it in the newspaper, because this will also be very beneficial to readers, we think, and its value is probably no less than the reading methods and research and exploration of certain problems published before.</p>
<p>Now we will answer Mr. Xu's questions one by one, but due to space limitations, we can only describe them very briefly; however, if we were answering them separately, it might be more detailed.</p>
<p>(1) I am now starting to talk about the Dialectical Materialism Course, but I don't know what form the book report should take?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the reading report, we will put forward detailed opinions in the next issue of reading news, so we will not say it for the time being.</p>
<p>(2) What is the meaning of the two words "reality" and "practice," and how do they differ?</p>
<p>Answer: The "reality" mentioned here has a philosophical meaning, which is opposed to the term "possibility." The so-called "possibility" refers to such a state (correctly speaking, it should be the two words "situation"), that is, the conditions for the existence or occurrence of a certain thing are already met, but we still dare not assert that it will necessarily occur. However, if this "possibility" is realized, then it is "reality." Therefore, the so-called "reality" is a situation after "possibility" progresses to "necessity." As for the word "practice," it has the meaning of "action," which is opposed to and unified with "theory." We can say that "reality" refers to the objective environment, while "practice" refers to our behavior of changing the objective environment.</p>
<p>(3) What is the minority faction? (Page 1 of the original book)</p>
<p>Answer: The meaning of the minority faction here refers to all those who oppose the current socialist construction line in Russia. This term is inherited from the "minority faction" of the majority faction and minority faction in the old Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. The minority faction is also known as the Mensheviks.</p>
<p>(4) What is "Ideology"? (Page 4)</p>
<p>Answer: "Ideology" is the transliteration of the English name "Ideology," usually translated as "consciousness form," and some people translate it as "ideological system." That is, the meaning of "social consciousness" (SocialConscience). The so-called "social consciousness" refers to the emotions, viewpoints, concepts, and ideas of people in a certain society regarding the world and various social phenomena. After these viewpoints are systematized and cast into an entire system of concepts, they are named "Ideology," which includes science, religion, art, and so on. But how does "Ideology" arise? This is because people's consciousness is determined by the relations and conditions of social production. It is a reflection of the existing social conclusions and relations of production, so there is a systematic consciousness in society; therefore, when the conditions of production change, the Ideology also changes accordingly. In class society, Ideology is class-based, and there is no Ideology that is detached from class. The basis for this explanation is: "Objective material existence determines thinking."</p>
<p>(5) "There has been no necessary change in the 'today' problem of socialism." Please explain these two sentences more clearly. (Line 9 on the same page)</p>
<p>Answer: This will be clear after reading the context. The previous article said, "Practice is supported by the conclusions of theory, and it moves forward more certainly." It also said, "Our theoretical thoughts must proceed in the same pace with the practice of socialism." Therefore, the theory should not stagnate and not advance. These two sentences mean that the academic circles (that is, theory) in the Soviet Union in the past have not studied the current problems from practice, but are still following the old saying and distorting it.</p>
<p>(6) What does "starting from objective reality" mean? (Line 3 on page 9)</p>
<p>Answer: This means "to understand the world from practice." (7) What does "to conquer blind necessity" mean? (Line 6 on page 13)</p>
<p>Answer: This sentence is also a continuation of the previous article. Didn't the previous article have these two sentences in the marginal notes? "Not only to explain the world, but must transform the world"; didn't the previous article say... "Revolutionary change objective reality, turn necessity into freedom." Therefore, if you understand the previous article, you will also understand the meaning of this sentence. If you don't understand this sentence, I am afraid that you still don't understand the meaning of "transforming the world." Now I will give you a brief explanation: Capitalism is bound to collapse, but if it is not promoted by human power, it will not be eliminated. Therefore, we should "conquer blind necessity." In other words, transform reality with human power and promote the speedy realization of necessity. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e190">Imperial Incense飘渺Green <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Princess Der Ling Original, Qin Shouou Translation</p>
<p>Therefore, I couldn't help but worry about the railway workers driving the train. Perhaps some movement of the train might displease the Empress Dowager, and they would be executed along with it. Just a simple word from this old woman, and their heads could be hung up immediately!</p>
<p>At that time, our Empress Dowager was truly like a child who had received a new toy.</p>
<p>Before she boarded this mysterious train, she decided to see what it was like.</p>
<p>After all, what kind of thing was it? So she ordered the palanquin bearers to stop the imperial carriage so that she could command at will. She first instructed the train to move forward slowly. The train moved, and she was truly overjoyed; she even forgot her own dignity, bent down, and stared intently at the spinning iron wheels, while also firing off countless questions. She asked: How is there steam in the locomotive? How is steam made? What is actually pushing these turntables? Why can't the train run on flat ground and must run on rails? Her demeanor completely transformed into that of a child; no one would have thought that she was a tyrannical empress!</p>
<p>The train moved forward and backward according to her commands, forward and backward, until she was satisfied and seemed to understand how the train could move on its own. Only then did she order the boarding.</p>
<p>In front of the carriage she used, there was a wooden board like a gangplank placed on a ship, covered with a yellow velvet carpet. Li Lianying walked ahead of her, holding her arm, and many eunuchs on both sides protected her with their hands to prevent her from falling. As soon as she stepped onto the carriage, the wooden board was immediately removed. (13)</p>
<h3 id="e191">Flagpole <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>To eradicate feudal forces, it is necessary to gradually destroy the old feudal remnants. Therefore, the two flagpoles in front of the Jiangsu Governor-General's office in Suzhou could not escape their fate. As for when these two flagpoles were erected, there is no way to verify. Now, the Wuxian County Government, feeling they are useless to keep but a pity to discard, has given them to Soochow University. Soochow University originally intended to move them and use them as flagpoles for the national flag. They first hired workers to estimate the moving project, but those workers shook their heads, because the height of four or five zhang (approximately 13-17 meters) meant they could neither be carried upright nor lifted horizontally. In the end, they had to cut them into three sections and transport them on flatbed carts, abandoning the original plan and using them for other purposes. Everyone has a feeling: how much manpower was spent back then to cut them down from the mountains and transport them into Suzhou city? The power of the feudal era is truly astonishing. Perhaps even houses were demolished when turning corners, who knows.</p>
<p>Flagpoles are not unique to government offices; some temples also have them, and even families with successful candidates in the imperial examinations have them. It is said that after passing the imperial examination, one had to erect a flagpole. The Peng family in Suzhou's Fengmen, with ancestors and descendants who were top scholars and brothers who passed the examination together, was the family with the most successful candidates. Therefore, there was a forest of flagpoles in front of their house. Although the flagpoles are no longer there today, the stone pillars supporting the flagpoles still stand in a row. The people of Suzhou call their home "Qigan Li" (Flagpole Lane), and these kinds of flagpoles are filled with the stench of the imperial examination system.</p>
<p>Speaking of flagpoles, there is also a little anecdote: those old flagpoles that once stood in front of the Governor-General's office raised the new flags of the "Jiangsu Military Governor's Office" and "Revive the Han and Pacify the People" on September 16th of the Xinhai year (1911). So, these two flagpoles can also be considered founding heroes of the Party and the Nation, ha ha!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Wireless Telephone <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Weijing</p>
<p>The wireless telephone has now become an indispensable decoration in upscale homes and large stores.</p>
<p>A store equipped with a radio, even in these economically depressed times, can attract a few nominal customers who don't buy anything but just listen to the radio, constantly stationed at the entrance. Although this situation will absolutely not have any positive impact on business, in terms of show, it's still better than the clerks with their hands in their sleeves, leaning on the counter and watching sparrows dance in front of the door. This is the motivation for stores to install wireless telephones.</p>
<p>In families, the old lady who loves to chant Buddha's name can hear Amitabha Buddha on the radio. The young lady who loves to listen to "The Story of Three Smiles" and "The Pearl Pagoda" can hear the clanging tunes of Fang Qing and Tang Bohu on the radio. The young mistress has no other hobbies except for Suzhou opera and Shanghai tunes, so she can light a cigarette and listen to "Eighteen Touches" and "Little Widow." If she tunes in just right, she might even catch "Peach Blossom River" or a lullaby, which can be quite interesting. The eldest, second, and third young ladies bring their sweethearts home on their days off, waiting for jazz music on the radio, hugging and cuddling, getting what they want. This is the reason why upscale families cannot do without wireless telephones. Wireless telephones are all the rage; playing phonographs is outdated. However, radio broadcasts still have many record programs. Although records are out of fashion, they are still very popular in broadcasts, which is a rather interesting phenomenon.</p>

<p>— Dinghua</p>
<p>Stepping on the creaking frozen road, facing the whistling, sharp wind, a group of children walked towards a village town in twos and threes. A thin, small carrying pole, with two heavy baskets hanging on each end, rested on everyone's shoulder, and their clothes were full of holes. Before dawn, they had already reached the entrance of the town.</p>
<p>"Malt candy... Old man!" The voice was like a cuckoo in the middle of the night, made even more eerie by the wind.</p>
<p>"Malt candy, old man... Hey, old man..." They walked all over East Street, South Street, West Street, North Street, all the streets in the town. Each person's basket was still full.</p>
<p>"Malt candy, old man... Hey... old man." Hunger and cold raised their voices.</p>
<p>Snap! The upstairs window of a house facing the street opened. Dozens of eyes simultaneously shot a beam of hope upward. "Making a ruckus on the street early in the morning, disturbing my old lady's sleep! You little country bastards, no parents to discipline you!" A mouthful of phlegm, acting as the "accompaniment" to the cursing, fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Snap! The window closed again.</p>
<p>"Want malt candy! Want malt candy!" The voice was much lower.</p>
<p>The children still carried the full baskets of malt candy back, knowing that there would be no food to eat today.</p>

<p>The woman stood on the left side of the writing desk, her face slightly flushed.</p>
<p>"Has it come yet?" The doctor raised his head, seemingly impatiently, lacking the kindness of the first question.</p>
<p>"..." Still no answer.</p>
<p>This time the doctor felt annoyed. His head immediately returned to its original position.</p>
<p>"Dr. X!" The assistant across from him seemed to have caught the "impatience" too.</p>
<p>"Hmm..." The doctor's head was mobilized again, but the situation was lazy.</p>
<p>"Probably hasn't come yet!"</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"She's shaking her head!"</p>

<p>He thought that he had no need to avoid her. Therefore, from afar, he took off his fur hat and nodded to Guizhi. How could Guizhi ignore him? So she nodded in return and smiled, "Second Master has come back for the New Year." Ji Zhi smiled, "The Chinese always have such deep family values. If I didn't come back, I couldn't face my elder brother and sister-in-law. Mrs. Zhao has gained weight since I last saw her." These three words, "Mrs. Zhao," were the first time Gan Jizhi had called her that, and it was also the first change in address since they had known each other. For some unknown reason, Guizhi's heart immediately pounded when she heard this form of address, and her face flushed. She forced a smile and replied, "Isn't that right? People just get stupider as they grow older." As she spoke, she pulled the scarf she had added forward, trying to cover her pregnant belly. Ji Zhi put his hat back on and clasped his sleeves together, looking very composed as he walked towards the street. At this time, Guizhi saw him clearly. His complexion was the opposite of what it used to be, very haggard. The dry and disheveled hair was visible outside the fur hat, showing that he no longer had the rich and elegant air he once had. Guizhi thought, "Since he has treated me with such openness, I might as well treat him with the same generosity." So she smiled at him and said, "Second Master Gan has become thinner." Ji Zhi raised his head and sighed deeply, "How could I gain weight? As the saying goes, 'A spacious home produces young masters,' and I am the opposite of those five words. Mrs. Zhao, do you believe that life is full of joys and sorrows, partings and reunions, just like a play? In the end, it's all empty." Guizhi turned her head to look at the house and then said to Ji Zhi, "Second Master Gan, why are you making such complaints?" Ji Zhi said, "I'm not complaining, I'm telling the truth. You see, I'll be a monk soon." Guizhi smiled, "Why are you saying these things during the New Year?" Ji Zhi said, "If it weren't for the New Year, I wouldn't be making these complaints. Think about it, how quickly does time pass?" (364)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Research on Inkstones (24) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Wuliao Ke (Bored Guest)</p>
<p>Other Famous Inkstones</p>
<p>The general characteristics of the Duan, She, and Cheng inkstones have been described above. Besides these three, there are a few other extremely famous inkstones that are rarely seen in genuine form today, or could even be said to be non-existent, but they are the objects of dreams for inkstone lovers, so it is also necessary to briefly describe them.</p>
<p>1.  Ancient Tile Inkstones and Ancient Bricks</p>
<p>I have not researched ancient tile inkstones very much, because very few ancient tile inkstones have been passed down to the present day. There are also many imitations made in the Tang and Song dynasties, and it is quite difficult to distinguish the genuine from the fake, so it does not arouse my interest in research. Therefore, today I will only briefly discuss what I know. The ancient tile inkstones that I have seen are only the Weiyang, Tongque, Xinghe, and Shiqu varieties. The most famous are the Weiyang and Tongque.</p>
<p>Weiyang Tiles: In the seventh year of Emperor Gao of Han, Xiao He built the Weiyang Palace in Chang'an. The tiles of the palace halls were like half-cylinders, and those covering the eaves had their heads facing outward, with a round face of five inches in diameter and a circumference of slightly more than one chi and six cun (approximately 53 cm). There were four seal characters of six different types: "Han Unifies the World," "Eternal Joy Unending," "Chuxu Weiyang," "Eternal Life Without Limit," "Boundless Longevity," "Eternal Longevity," and "Taiji Weiyang." They were about an inch (approximately 3 cm) thick. Later, those who obtained them removed the body to make inkstones, which are commonly called tile head inkstones. The half-cylinder tiles could also be used to grind ink after slightly flattening their backs. However, their quality was slightly inferior to that of the Tongque, and after being buried in the soil for many years, they were quite thirsty for water. However, since the early Han Dynasty to the present, almost three thousand years, it is difficult to obtain them, so people regard them as treasures. Among the verifiable imitations made later, those from the Ming Dynasty are the best. Tang's Inkstone Treatise records that Wang Gongzai, named Zuo, of Jishui, said: "During the Xuande reign, the old prince of the Ning Mansion in Jiangxi created Han Weiyang Palace tile inkstones, changing them to the current cloth tile style, which were extremely exquisite and were often given to visiting officials as treasures for enjoyment. Grinding ink on them did not make them thirsty for water. There was an inscription on the surface with eleven lines, each line with six characters, and at the end, there were three characters written by Yuexian in ancient clerical script. Below were two small seals with the characters 'Ning Guo.' In the middle of the surface were carved four [characters], making a small ring pattern. The inkstone had a water pool, with eight seal characters on the left: 'Ancient Tile of the Yan Han, Bestowed by Heaven,' and on the right: 'Sons and Grandsons Forever Preserve [It].' Below were twelve small seal characters in four lines: 'For Cherishing the Quality of Pottery, It Is Appropriate to Add the Sealing of Jimo.' On the back, in the middle, were written the six large characters 'Weiyang Palace East Pavilion Tile,' enclosed in a square of one cun. On the left were the four characters 'Great Han Tenth Year,' and on the right were the six characters 'Supervised by Marquis of Zan, Xiao He,' all in clerical script, slightly smaller than the middle ones." These inkstones imitated by the old Prince Shen are already rare today. How much more difficult is it to obtain a genuine tile from the early Han Dynasty, which has been eroded and damaged for many years? The tiles produced later were all crudely made and not worth looking at. Therefore, today, if you want to study tile inkstones, you only need one with a relatively ancient color, finer texture, and more elegant clerical and seal carvings to be considered a treasure, without the need to worry about its authenticity.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Announcement of Chinese Basketball Players Attending the Far Eastern Games: All Representatives from North China Join, Chen and Yu from Hubei Supplement; No One from Beijing or Shanghai Selected Due to Failure to Meet Individual Technical Standards <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>After four matches, the selection committee has chosen the official 12 representatives of the Chinese basketball players attending the Far Eastern Games, announced as follows:</p>
<p>Tang Kunxian, Zhang Yucai, Liu Zhenyuan, Mu Zuoyun, Li Zhenzhong, Wang Yuzeng, Zhang Jingzhi, Yin Hongxiang, Wang Xiliang, Wang Zhanruo, Chen Shengkui, Yu Jingxiao</p>
<p>Among the 12, no one was selected from the Beijing and Shanghai teams, while 10 were selected from the North China team. Only Liu Xueqi and Wang Zhanbin were not selected, and Chen Shengkui and Yu Jingxiao from the Hubei team supplemented the roster. It is known that Chen and Yu were also famous North China players under the guidance of Dong Shouyi.</p>
<p>The National Basketball Preliminary Tournament of the North China, Hubei, Shanghai, and Nanjing teams has concluded. Nanjing lost both matches, Shanghai won against Beijing but lost to Hubei, and Hubei won both matches. However, they lost to North China in the final round.</p>
<p>Among the teams, North China is the strongest, as it is composed of well-known players from Beijing and Tianjin, and is recognized by people across the country as the ideal representative to attend the Far Eastern Games. Therefore, although the official representatives to attend the Far Eastern Games went through a preliminary round, the decision was actually made internally long ago. Now, as expected, it has met the expectations of the nation.</p>
<p>However, even though the North China team is the ideal representative, not all of them necessarily have the qualifications to be selected. In other words, there may be one or two outstanding players in other teams who are qualified to be selected. Although the personnel of the Nanjing and Shanghai teams who attended the preliminary round have mediocre skills, it is not necessarily the case that none of them have the qualifications to be alternate members, and that they are all inferior to the alternate members of the North China team.</p>
<p>As for the selection method, the National Sports Association has already announced it and repeatedly stated that individual skills are the standard. Now, looking at the selected representatives, it is unclear whether individual skills were the standard, or whether the entire team was the standard.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if the entire team was used as the selection standard, it would be reasonable and humane to select one or two alternate members from other teams. Is it really the case that none of the alternate members from other teams have the qualifications?</p>
<p>Yu Jingxiao from the Hubei team was unremarkable in the four matches, lacking both offense and defense. Compared to Wu Guolin from the same team, the difference in skills is vast. Now, Wu has been abandoned in favor of Yu, and Wu is even better than many of the official representatives. Wang Shixuan from Nanjing and Lu Zhongen from Shanghai are also qualified to be alternate members. The selection of Wang Xiliang and Wang Zhanruo is actually forced. Some say that the strategy is different, which is why Wang and Lu could not be selected. This argument is relevant to the official players, but does not affect the alternate members. Moreover, it is not necessarily the case that one or two alternate members would affect the entire team. Therefore, the selection of Wang and Lu is also normal. This is all there is to the so-called standard and the so-called selection.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Track and Field Supplementary Selection Today at 3 PM at the Track and Field Ground <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The 25 track and field athletes who have been selected have already been listed in the previous newspaper.

<h3 id="e200">Leaving for Hong Kong Today to Participate in the Preliminary Round; A Group of Fourteen Led by Feng Jianwei; Dai, Sun, Lu, and Feng Will Not Be Able to Go Due to Other Matters; Will Have a Second Preliminary Match with the South China Team <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai football team participating in the Far Eastern Games preliminary round, a group of fourteen led by Feng Jianwei, is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong on the Dollar Line's President Grant at 2 PM today to have a preliminary match with the South China team. They are expected to arrive in Hong Kong on Friday noon. The full list of team members is as follows:</p>
<p>Li Ning (Captain), Xu Heng, Jiang Shanjing, Gu Shangxiang, Guan Xun'an, Tu Kaiyuan, Liang Shutang, Chen Zhenxiang, Wan Xianghua, Wu Youliang, Chen Hongguang, Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun, Lu Zhongen, Dai Linjing, and Feng Yunyou will remain in Shanghai. Sun Jinshun cannot leave Shanghai because his wife and son are both ill. Lu Zhongen is on his honeymoon. Dai Linjing is busy with the affairs of the National Goods Bank, which is currently relocating. Feng Yunyou is also unable to leave due to his duties. Dai may depart with Shen Siliang in the future, but it has not been decided yet. The Shanghai team will have a second match with South China in Hong Kong. After the team members for the Far Eastern Games are selected, they will have two or three practice matches before departing for Manila. Those who are not selected will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Yesterday, the Shanghai team specially arranged a practice match with the Whites, resulting in a 3-3 draw. The match report is as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3 PM, the team had a practice match with the Whites at the Shen Garden. Unfortunately, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, and Feng Yunyou did not play. The match ended in a 3-3 draw. The referee was Chen Jixiang.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Still the Same as Before <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Being a practice match with no bearing on the outcome, coupled with a long absence from team play and a lack of stamina, it is difficult to expect a wonderful performance and surprising events. All seventeen members of the team, except for Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Feng Yunyou, and Lu Zhongen, took to the field and participated in the match in rotation. The team's cooperation was naturally lacking, and their individual performances were still the same as before, with no special contributions. It is difficult to judge their merits. Perhaps they will show something in the upcoming matches in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e202">First Encounter with Misfortune <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The Whites' left winger, Merlin, made a diagonal kick, which Xu Heng jumped up to deflect behind. This was the Shanghai team's first encounter with danger after kicking off. Subsequently, Wan Xianghua created a favorable situation, but Chen Zhenxiang kicked the ball into the sky. The enemy counterattacked, and A Qiao received the ball from the right and passed it diagonally to the left. Tao Lewei took the opportunity to shoot, hitting the back of the net. The Shanghai team conceded the first goal.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Good News Comes in Succession <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Li Ning sent a long ball, and Wan Xianghua advanced quickly, dodging the enemy generals and passing to Li Yichen. Li did not hog the ball and passed it to the right. Chen Jiaqiu did not fail in his mission and kicked the ball into the net off the goalpost, tying the score at 1-1. This goal came only a few minutes after conceding the goal. Five minutes later, Zhong Yongsen penetrated the left flank, and the Shanghai forwards surged forward like a tide. The ball was passed from left to center, and Li Yichen and the enemy fought for it, both falling to the ground at the same time. Chen Hongguang reaped the benefits, making the score 2-1 in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Peaceful Ending <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Not long after the start of the second half, Wu Youliang intercepted the enemy's path in the middle and passed the ball to the front. Chen Hongguang dribbled and advanced, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to pass the ball diagonally to the left. Li Yichen fell to the ground and kicked the ball into the net, giving Shanghai a dominant position of 3-1. Subsequently, the Shanghai team frequently substituted players, and the line became disorganized, repeatedly being pressed by the enemy. Fortunately, goalkeeper Xu Heng was still competent, providing temporary security. Until the last fifteen minutes, the enemy generals redoubled their efforts, and A Qiao scored two goals in a row, resulting in a 3-3 draw.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Second Day of Women's Tennis Preliminary Round; Liu Yulan Wins Again Over Huang Shuyi; Huang Sisters Will Compete Today <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the women's tennis preliminary round. Liu Yulan from Nanjing defeated Huang Shuyi from Beiping after a three-set battle. Shuyi and Shuqing have the same problem: too many out balls and net touches, lacking control. Liu eventually won the first set with a steady performance. Liu's victory was easy. Huang's second set performance was very good, winning with long and short balls. However, she could not maintain the original state in the third set and was defeated again. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>6-0</p>
<p>Liu Yulan 2-6 Huang Shuyi</p>
<p>6-1</p>
<p>Shuyi's skills are much better than Shuqing's. Her serve and backhand are the most reliable, and her posture is beautiful with sufficient power, which Liu lacks. However, her footwork is sometimes chaotic, with frequent errors. Liu won entirely with baseline long shots, persisting with perseverance and without losing her temper.</p>
<p>Liu won the first set very easily, with Huang completely at a loss, losing all six games. In the second set, Huang changed her strategy, using balls to the left, right, near, and far to embarrass the opponent, and concentrated her attack on Liu's backhand, causing Liu great distress and panic. Huang won 6-2. Seeing this situation, it was thought that it would not be difficult for Huang to take the third set, but she suddenly changed her form again and was put on the defensive, making one mistake after another. Liu won again 6-1. At 3 PM today, Huang Shuqing and Shuyi will compete against each other at the China Tennis Court.</p>

<p>Participating in the Last Match of the Far Eastern Basketball Preliminary Round</p>
<h3 id="e208">North China Decisively Defeated Hubei Yesterday; North China Performed Skillfully, Hubei Found It Difficult to Cope; 72-35, a One-Sided Situation <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The result of the final match between North China and Hubei yesterday in the Far Eastern Basketball Preliminary Round was a decisive victory for North China with a score of 72-35. Because the game was one-sided, the situation was never tense. North China team had several clever performances in the first half, but in the second half, both sides sent out reserve forces, greatly reducing the interest. It is difficult to call it a wonderful match. The audience numbered around 2,000, the largest crowd for the preliminary round.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Polished and Skillful Performance <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>In the first half, North China first sent out Tang Baokun and the other five players from Tianjin, the former Lianghua Five Generals. Their teamwork was very polished, and their skillful short passes were especially appreciated. Li Zhenzhong has improved since his last visit to Shanghai. The speed of the whole team was not very fast, and there were very few long shots. Most of the shots that went in were near the basket. It is feared that they will not have such a relaxed opportunity to compete against Japan and the Philippines. Because Hubei team fundamentally lacked defensive strength, Wang Jianmin was barely able to hold his own, and Yu Jingxiao was especially lax on defense. North China was able to drive straight in. In the second half, both sides sent out reserve forces, and Hubei was even worse. North China's reserve force was originally made up of players from Beiping, so they were able to do whatever they wanted. Finally, Hubei's official lineup was sent out again to end the game.</p>
<h3 id="e210">North China Drove Straight In <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Guoxun served as the referee. After the two sides engaged, Hubei's Yu Jingxiao made a long shot from the right corner, scoring successfully. Hubei opened the scoring first. Li Zhenzhong flicked the ball twice under the basket, scoring both times. Yu Jingxiao also scored again, tying the score at 4-4. Zhao Zhenzhong brought the ball in and scored 7 points on his own. After 11-4, North China drove straight in without any hindrance. After 19-6, Liu Xueqi replaced Liu Zhenyuan, but contributed nothing. Liu then re-entered. The result of the first half was 31-11.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Reserves Fully Mobilized <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, all the official players from both sides withdrew. The North China team was replaced by Wang Yuzeng and others, while the Hubei team was replaced by Cheng Yuehan and others. Wang Yuzeng was as light as a swallow, cooperating with Mou Zuoyun in and out of the basket, continuing to score points. However, the Hubei players were merely second-rate, so the performance became dull. The score became 51 to 16, with an even greater difference between the two sides. Chen Shengkui and others reappeared on the court, but it could no longer add to the interest. The situation became slightly more moderate, and both sides reluctantly finished the match. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>North China Free Throws Fouls Points Hubei Free Throws Fouls Points</p>
<p>Liu Zhenyuan ○○○○ Chen Shengkui 二三一七 (2 3 17)</p>
<p>Liu Xueqi ○一三一 (0 1 3 1) Cheng Yuehan ○一○○一 (0 1 0 1)</p>

<p>Bai Hong originally scheduled a friendly match against Zhonghua on March 22nd at the Zhonghua Athletic Field. It is now known that only six members of the Zhonghua team have come to Shanghai and are unable to compete. The Northeast team will replace them at that time. The Northeast team is very strong. Bai Hong has sent letters to out-of-town players Zhang Jiakui, Lu Yaxiong, Chen Ling, Wu Zijing, Liu Yingjun, and Li Disheng, inviting them to come to Shanghai to participate. The Northeast team members are all athletes from the four northeastern provinces who were scattered after the September 18th Incident and displaced. This reorganization aims to remind the public not to forget the Northeast. As for technical exchanges, that is secondary. The list of Northeast team members is as follows: Liu Changchun (Liaoning), Zhang Lingjia (Liaoning), Fu Baolu, Ha) Xiao Dinghua (Liaoning), Wang Shilin (Jilin), Wang Mingshen (Harbin), Yi Fuzhen (Liaoning), Liu Renxiu (Liaoning), Zheng Sen (Liaoning), Peng Yongxin (Heilongjiang).</p>

<p>According to Huang, the issue of university presidents not holding concurrent positions was once advocated by former Minister Jiang. At that time, Jiang resolutely resigned from his position at Zhejiang University in order to implement this measure. The recent amendment to Article 9 of the University Organization Law passed by the Legislative Yuan, the content of which the Ministry has not yet seen. As for which positions university presidents should not hold concurrently, it is not yet clear at this time. It is feared that the amendments this time will be even stricter than before.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Degree Law to Add a Level <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>As for the Degree Law, the Ministry originally considered setting up two levels, Bachelor's and Doctorate. Now, in order to accurately distinguish the levels of graduates, it has been decided to add a Master's level. Therefore, the Degree Law will be divided into three levels. It is currently being drafted and will soon be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Preparation for University Entrance Examinations Begins <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of holding university entrance examinations, scholars have advocated for its implementation recently. After careful consideration, the Ministry has also confirmed that it is necessary to implement. However, the prerequisite for implementing this matter is to define university course standards. University course standards are different from the course standards of primary and secondary schools. Primary and secondary schools have fewer subjects and the level is more uniform, making it easier to compile. Universities focus on researching academic principles, and ordinary levels can only be set in colleges or departments. It is impossible to set standards for each course. Currently, medical colleges have collected textbook materials from schools and plan to establish a medical course standards committee to start work. The second step is to research the course standards of law colleges, and then proceed to research the courses of science, agriculture, and engineering colleges in turn. The medical course standards committee will be established in two months, and the law course standards committee can also be established next semester.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Major Universities Establish Affiliated Research Institutes <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a joint meeting of various Geng Fund organizations resolved to use Geng Funds to handle various educational undertakings. The Ministry plans to handle the case of universities establishing affiliated research institutes first. However, there are many universities, and it is difficult to handle them simultaneously. It will start with national universities first. The preparation period for this research institute is expected to be three years. The first step is to investigate the existing equipment of each school, and then request funding to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Executive Yuan Decides to Subsidize Private Schools <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Huang finally stated that the Executive Yuan has recently approved the subsidy for private universities, and the annual subsidy has been set at 720,000 yuan. How to allocate these funds will be decided after investigating the current situation of each school. Priority will be given to subsidizing more complete private universities.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Key Points for Improving Zhejiang Education: Report from the Ministry of Education Inspector <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent personnel to inspect education in Zhejiang Province. The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry of Education. The opinions on how to improve education in Zhejiang are explored below:</p>
<p>(1) Although the province's jurisdiction is not vast, the affairs of the provincial supervisors are heavy, and the existing staff is insufficient to assign. The number of staff should be appropriately increased based on the situation. In most counties, the county supervisors' inspections are not universal, and some counties do not have full-time supervisors. Orders should be issued to add staff as appropriate.</p>
<p>(2) The local education guidance conferences have achieved significant results. However, the content of discussions at the guidance conferences in a few county school districts is too scattered. Efforts should be made to improve in the future, striving to focus on the study of central issues to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>(3) The education staff set up in each county school district is not effective due to low salaries and varying abilities. Salaries should be increased, personnel should be selected carefully, and performance evaluations should be strictly implemented to increase efficiency. The establishment of education committees in various counties is well-intentioned, but in most counties, their work is too lax. They should be urged to encourage them.</p>
<p>(4) Among the provincial schools, there are still several schools such as the police academy, the autonomous specialized school, the midwifery school, the aquatic products school, the agricultural extension personnel training center, and the pest control personnel training center. The content is uneven and should be proposed by the Education Department at the provincial government meeting, together with the relevant administrative agencies, to discuss and improve them, and to make them subject to the supervision and guidance of the Education Department, so as to unify authority. In particular, aquatic vocational schools and their affiliated institutions should be taken over by the Education Department as soon as possible for direct management.</p>
<p>(5) The amount of provincial education funds is not suitable for actual needs, and the expansion of various education undertakings in the future requires funding. Efforts should be made to raise funds to supplement them.</p>
<p>(6) The provincial education funds have been separated. In the future, the accounting staff of provincial education institutions should be directly assigned by the Education Department to emphasize funding.</p>
<p>(7) The amount of education funds in each county and city is mostly insufficient, except for a very few counties. The management situation is also quite chaotic. The Education Department should consult with the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to formulate appropriate measures based on the situation of each county. On the one hand, it should designate a reliable source of funds to provide effective protection. On the other hand, it should hold all public officials responsible for the task of reorganization and organize special agencies to strictly supervise the implementation within a limited time.</p>
<p>(8) The methods for free places in each county and city vary, and they do not benefit the advancement of poor students. The Education Department should consider the situation of education funds in various places as soon as possible, order the counties to set up scholarships, and the methods for provincial funds to subsidize outstanding students from poor families in provincial secondary schools and above are not appropriate, and should be revised by the Education Department.</p>
<p>(9) The provincial medical and pharmaceutical specialized school is run practically, but the funding is insufficient. Efforts should be made to increase it appropriately to enrich the research and practice room and scientific medical equipment. The recruitment of full-time teachers, the expansion of the number of pharmacy students, and the improvement of student levels should also be promoted.</p>
<p>(10) There are still many vacancies for government-funded students in Europe and the United States. The Ministry's regulations for studying abroad should be followed, and measures should be taken to select and send qualified students to study in Europe and the United States regularly to cultivate talents. Definite regulations should be made for the submission of research reports during the study period and the obligation to serve in the province after graduation.</p>
<p>(11) The promotion of normal education and vocational education in the province has been handled separately by the Ministry. As for the measures proposed by the Education Department to urge private secondary schools to promote vocational education, they are still necessary in principle. However, the specific implementation measures should be formulated promptly after consulting the actual situation. The measures to promote secondary education for girls are in line with actual needs and are feasible. However, attention should be paid to promoting normal education for women and sericulture, weaving, and textile subjects suitable for women's careers.</p>
<p>(12) Most of the county, city, and joint private secondary schools are not well managed, except for a few that are still worth watching. They should be strictly assessed and rectified.</p>
<p>(13) The salary standards for principals and teachers in secondary schools are commensurate with the local cost of living. However, the minimum standards for teachers in junior secondary schools in county, city, and private secondary schools are too low and should be increased appropriately.</p>
<p>(14) Most of the provincial secondary school buildings are insufficient. When the provincial education funds increase in the future, the Education Department should balance the urgency and repair and construct the buildings of the Provincial Hangzhou Normal School and the Provincial Xianghu Rural Normal School in order.</p>
<p>(15) Most of the teaching equipment in various secondary schools is simple and should be enriched to facilitate teaching. The equipment for labor courses is also lacking, and should be added and expanded at any time.</p>
<p>(16) The curriculum content of general secondary schools is rich, and the teaching spirit is also vigorous. However, in a few schools, the experiment and practice are not very effective, and the teaching language is still in local dialect, which reduces the teaching efficiency. It should be improved immediately.</p>
<p>(17) The training in physical education in primary and secondary schools is not effective, and the physical fitness equipment is mostly insufficient. Measures should be taken to implement them as soon as possible. The necessary equipment should be added in stages according to the recommendations of the National Sports Conference.</p>
<p>(18) The number of primary schools in each county and city is insufficient, especially in remote areas. They should be added as much as possible to promote compulsory education. Private schools should be used as short-term compulsory primary schools to provide relief.</p>
<p>(19) Among the district primary schools in each county and city, many schools have small scales, insufficient student numbers, and facilities that do not meet the requirements. The Education Bureau should plan comprehensively to ensure that neighboring districts are hired to jointly establish complete schools with larger scales and more classes to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>(20) The distribution of activities in each group of primary schools implementing compound and single-grade teaching methods is often inappropriate. The guidance agencies should study and guide them carefully.</p>
<p>(21) The promotion of civil schools has achieved considerable results. However, the cause of civil education halls is still too focused on formal display, and the efficiency of guiding social education has not been fully utilized. Efforts should be made to improve them to achieve good results.</p>
<p>(22) The work of eliminating illiteracy and guiding mass sports has not been effective. Plans should be formulated and implemented to supervise progress.</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Essayification of the Novel <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>There is a noteworthy phenomenon in the current Chinese literary scene: the essayification of the novel. This seems connected to the recent flourishing of humorous sketches and "essays of the mind." It is also related to the current social environment in China. The emptiness of life leads people to gravitate towards "easy literature" (la Littérature Facile).</p>
<p>Essay-style novels are much easier to write than serious novels. Choosing the easy path of writing essay-style novels reveals the writer's lack of a serious creative attitude and an unfulfilled life.</p>
<p>A friend who edits a magazine told me, "Lately, some works are simply indistinguishable between novels and essays." This trend is visibly growing day by day, becoming more and more prominent.</p>
<p>I believe that novels and essays are different genres in literature, with strict distinctions between them.</p>
<p>Novel scholars like Hamilton say that novels must have elements such as structure, characters, and setting. England, as the advanced country of modern industrial capitalism, developed the novel form earliest. Lyly, Richardson, Fielding, and others set many requirements for the novel. Therefore, anything that contradicts the conditions of the novel—lacking structure, characters, and setting—can be called an essay or prose.</p>
<p>In terms of its social foundation, the novel is a product of the upwardly mobile bourgeoisie, while essays are products of the aristocracy or literati. Novels have structure, plot twists, and story development, while essays are leisurely and rambling, often close to poetry and a prose substitute for poetry.</p>
<p>Of course, this refers to novels before the last century. By the late 19th century, in the atmosphere of aestheticism, impressionism, and symbolism—a reaction against realism—most writers abandoned reality, daring not to face la bêtise humaine. Some novels abandoned the task of social representation, and the trend of essayification of the novel grew daily. A significant example of this is much of Anatole France's work.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the essayification of the novel is not an upward trend. It contains a kind of crisis. The giant André Gide, a man with the strongest artistic conscience and the fiercest pursuit of desire, only acknowledges "The Counterfeiters" as a proper novel (roman) among his many works. His insightful and far-sightedness is imaginable. When essays invade the realm of the novel, should our writers strive for a "defense of the novel"? Should we protect the independence of the novel form?</p>
<p>I believe that we must pay special attention to this trend of essayification of the novel. We must constantly prevent the development of "easy literature." On one hand, our writers must create new and more advanced novel forms, and on the other hand, they must constantly defend against the crisis of the essayification of the novel.</p>

<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>(Traveling to West Tianmu)</p>
<p>March 30th, Friday, cloudy and sunny. West Tianmu Mountain belongs to Qian County. Yesterday, I got off the train at a small station named Zaoxi. From there I took a sedan chair north for thirty or forty li. Midway, I passed Jiaokou Ridge, which was about one or two hundred zhang high. After passing Jiaokou Ridge, the scenery on all sides changed. Outside the ridge was a world of small mountains and barren fields, desolate and unbearable. Inside the ridge to the north, the lofty Tianmu was right in front of me. Clear streams flowed beside the road; naturally, these were the Shuangqing streams flowing down from the southern foot of Tianmu Mountain. Sometimes converging, sometimes separating, the streams sometimes met the road. There were many villages, the fields were fertile, and there were many bridges and roadside pavilions, to say nothing of other things. After passing the Baihe Bridge over the Baihe Stream and the Moon Bridge, the road ascended gradually. After entering Dayou Village, I was already on the mountain road. The sky was overcast, the trees were dark and dense. As soon as I reached the mountain gate, in this dark net where the night and tree shadows competed, I soon heard the hypnotic suggestion of bells, drums, and chanting. A feeling of prolonged fear,寂滅, conversion, and world-renunciation suddenly struck my mind like lightning. The mysterious power of religion and the possibility of miracles were fully comprehended here. This was partly due to the lateness of the hour, and partly, I think, because I was tired from a day of travel, and my muscles and energy were a little relaxed.</p>
<p>The founder of West Tianmu was the Chan master Gao Feng from Wujiang, born in the Jiaxi era of the Yuan dynasty. His place of practice was the Lion Rock Head of West Peak. To this day, there is still a place called the "Dead Pass," which was the name Gao Feng Chan Master used when he was practicing. The Chan Master's bone pagoda is now in the Lion Mouth below Lion Peak. From the Yuan to the Ming dynasties, the temples and monasteries of West Tianmu were all built around the Lion Peak, the so-called Lion Orthodox Chan Temple. Before the Yuan dynasty, the name of West Tianmu Mountain was not clearly seen in the classics. Su Dongpo did not visit it during his county travels, nor did Xie An leave any traces of his mountain excursions there. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the temple was repeatedly abandoned and rebuilt. It was not until the Kangxi era of the Qing dynasty that the National Teacher Yulin began to build the Gao Feng Daocheng at the base of the current Chanyuan Temple, which was actually a variant of the Qingzhuang ruins built by Yuan Hongqiao's ancestor who donated fields. In the gloomy night, the sedan chair arrived at the mountain gate. Getting out of the sedan chair, I saw a huge eight-character yellow wall, with wooden frames scattered inside and outside. It seemed that the mountain gate of this sacred mountain of Tianmu was under construction. After entering the gate and walking for one or two li, the ground rose a section. Entering the Hall of the Heavenly Kings. After another section higher, entering the Hall of Weituo Bodhisattva. Again a section higher, there was a plaque with the words "Xingdao" hanging there, the Dharma Hall. From here, section after section, higher and higher, passing the Grand Hall of the Great Hero, passing through the abbot's residence, winding and circling, it took over ten minutes to reach the guest room on the eastern five-bay upstairs hall. The windows were bright, the tables were clean, the lamps were bright, and the room was deep. The furnishings were like those of a top-notch hotel in Shanghai, only missing a few electric lights and a few female believers selling songs and bodies.</p>
<p>It was the evening of the 15th day of the second lunar month. After a very comfortable vegetarian dinner, the clouds broke and the moon came out. From the corridor, I could see many green peaks and black shadows in front of and behind the temple, as well as a winding mountain stream full of strange rocks. The sound of the stream was sonorous, and the moonlight was blurred. Yu Tang, who had just finished reading the twenty-eighth chapter of "A Rustic's Exposure," was on the corridor with a cigar in his mouth, looking into the distance with his hands behind his back. Returning to the hearth, he exclaimed: "This is truly an excellent Dichtung!" Unfortunately, the mountainside was full of snow, and the outside air was sharp and cold. Facing this clear and empty night, we could only reluctantly give it up. After eating some peanuts bought from the vendors in the Hall of the Heavenly Kings and drinking some local wine with a peculiar taste, the few Dichters had no choice but to go to bed with resentment and dream their own dreams.</p>
<p>At seven in the morning, the poets' dreams were broken by the clear singing of mountain birds. Everyone got up to wash and have breakfast, and then prepared to take sedan chairs up the mountain to see the sights. Yu Tang caught a bit of a cold and was unwilling to move, only wanting to lie on the monk's bed in Chanyuan Temple and read "A Rustic's Exposure," so he did not go.</p>

<p>— Yi Ren</p>
<p>It was one day in the deep autumn of 1928. I suffered a severe bout of malaria in Hangzhou and had to return to Wuhan in disappointment. When passing through Shanghai, because a friend who promised to lend me twenty dollars temporarily broke his promise, I had to travel in steerage.</p>
<p>At dusk, a bleak drizzle fell. The only friend who saw me off was Gu Cheng. Because there would be fewer squabbles with ticket-scalping soldiers and other disturbances on a foreign ship, I boarded a ship of the XX Company. Luckily, there was one upper berth left in steerage, so I booked it. As I was making the bed, Gu Cheng bought a large bunch of bananas from the shore. The passengers in the lower berth were a young girl and a woman in her forties. Hearing our Hunan accent, they began to claim the same home with us in a Hubei accent—saying that Hunan and Hubei were one family. Fearing that I would be too lonely on the ship, Gu Cheng was happy to chat with them for a while. We talked and ate bananas for a while, and then Gu Cheng said goodbye and went ashore... I stood at the ship's door, watching Gu Cheng's black shadow disappear in the misty rain, and I felt very lost in my heart. I returned to the cabin and soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>When I woke up, the ship had entered the Yangtze River quite far. Although it was not long after dawn, I was already a little hungry. After washing my face and drinking milk, I still felt bored, so I went to the side of the ship to see the scenery. There was nothing much to see. However, when I returned to the cabin, I found something that piqued my curiosity... The two Hubei women sleeping in the lower berth had unfolded a large part of my mattress and hung it from the edge of the bed—as if it were a curtain; what was covered inside was the two women lying horizontally smoking opium. There was nothing unusual about smoking opium, but their technique of making the bubbles, the dexterity of their hands, did make me admire them and feel a sense of appreciation... The girl held a copper coin in her left hand and a shiny iron needle in her right hand. She used the shiny iron needle to pick a bit of opium paste from a small opium box—just the right amount—and then, very deftly, she burned it on the lamp while rotating it on the copper coin. She was able to prevent it from burning and rotate it without it sticking to the copper coin... Her technique had already impressed me very much. Then I saw that the woman's technique was even better... When she burned it on the lamp, it was just about to burn and stop, about to drip and not drop. When she rotated it on the copper coin, one turn was perfectly round, manipulating it freely, nothing was not just right. After they had enough of their addiction, they extinguished the lamp and apologized to me, putting my mattress back in place. But I was still very interested and felt that my appreciation was not enough. So I went elsewhere to look for opium smokers to watch. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Ma Zongrong</p>
<p>10.  Marriage comes from love, and vinegar comes from wine; it is a measured drink, not very palatable and bitter. Time makes it lose its heavenly fragrance and turns it into a household, tasteless, and ordinary drink. (Byron - English)</p>
<p>11. Women, never trust the vows of men... In order to get what they fervently desire, they are less sparing of vows than they are of promises; as soon as their desires are satisfied, they immediately forget their promises and their vows. (Catullus - Latin poet)</p>
<p>12. Lovers who do not quarrel are about to stop loving each other. (Ovid - Latin poet)</p>
<p>13. If you hear a woman slandering love, and a man of letters expressing dissatisfaction with public opinion, you can say that one has lost her beauty, and the other has exhausted his talent. (Diderot - French)</p>
<p>14. Women love, but do not know how to use love. (Alexandre Dumas fils - French)</p>
<p>15. Do not boast that the woman you love very much loves you very much. (Pythagoras - Greek)</p>
<p>16. What is generally called love in the world is not love; it is extreme selfishness... it is loving oneself in another person. (Esquiros - French)</p>
<p>17. No passion is more likely to arouse some noble or brave heart in us than sincere love. Love has a kind of heat that can give courage to those who lack courage. (Saint-Évremond - French)</p>
<p>18. The arguments of lovers are precisely what renew their love. (Terence - Latin poet)</p>
<p>19. The most disgraced mistress, as soon as she shows that she loves another man more than her lover, can make him restless and arouse all sorts of passionate shadows in his heart. (Stendhal - French)</p>

<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Walking in the wilderness, sometimes you need a bit of muddled ignorance; if you are too often sensitive, it will only cause more pain. This is not just a whim, but the experience I gained from my previous travels in the Gaoligong Mountains.</p>
<p>I remember that the mountain road that day followed a winding mountain stream. Trees grew profusely along the sides of the stream. Looking up, it was difficult to catch a glimpse of the sky and clouds. All along the way, I only saw the rushing stream, often bursting out from the winding thickets, colliding with jagged rocks, splashing pearls, laughing and jumping like a child, rushing down the slope past me. Sometimes, the mountain road would wind to the other side of the stream, and I had to step on the protruding stones in the water to cross. Sometimes, even this would happen... Suddenly, the mountain road and the stream seemed to disappear completely, and all that stood before me were towering cliffs and dense forests. However, once I climbed past the small path on the cliff, in the blink of an eye, the previous scenery would all reappear. I think that even if you walked all day on such a journey, no one would feel any fatigue, right?</p>
<p>When I was almost finished walking this mountain road, I suddenly encountered someone coming from the opposite direction, carrying a long knife in his hand, which immediately frightened me. The whistling I had been doing along the way immediately stopped, and I quietly held my breath. But he walked past me with a look of panic, glancing at me and hurrying past. I took a deep breath and looked closely at the small bamboo basket tied on his back. It was filled with potatoes and fruits. Only then did I realize that he was not a "bandit grandpa," but just a passing farmer, carrying a knife only to protect himself. It was then that I realized that this mountain road was probably not very safe. However, it could also be said that perhaps that person was too nervous? In short, from the beginning, I had not been sensitive to "meeting a bandit grandpa," but had simply moved forward in a muddled state. In any case, this could be considered fortunate. Even if someone suddenly ended my life with a knife along the way, it would be more comfortable and enjoyable than being frightened all the way and then meeting misfortune.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to move forward frankly on the journey of life and suffer less pain, then I think you should also be like walking in the wilderness, sometimes you must have a bit of muddled ignorance.</p>

<p>— Wang Yue</p>
<p>"It's true, 'home is good for a thousand days,' alas..." After a moment of silence, he lowered his head and sighed, then leaned against the wall with his buttocks, swung his arms twice, and began to tell, in a confused and mixed way, about his hardships as a wanderer and his wife and children, whom he had left in a small house in his hometown, and now there was no news of them. His narration was interrupted from time to time by hiccups caused by alcohol, and he repeatedly asked:</p>
<p>"What do you say?"</p>
<p>"Um, um..." After being asked many times, she reluctantly responded, shrinking and retreating into the alley. "Oh, a mute?" the man asked in surprise, and then he exclaimed in the tone of thinking it over in his mind, "Really a mute?"</p>
<p>"Um..." She had already disappeared into the shadows, but the man still stood there, one eye staring at the street lamp, his hand scratching the beard on his protruding chin. In a moment of contemplation, he sighed with a feeling of being tormented by loneliness: "There's really no way..." Then he followed her to the place where she had disappeared, and only left that human nest the next morning, rubbing his eyes. But after that, he would visit from time to time, for a little cold rice or pocket money, until the widow discovered their secret. This burly woman, with her hands stuck in the pockets of her wool vest, like a hen that had just laid an egg, laughed and ran through every kitchen, and in front of the assembled crowd she put forward her clever guess:</p>
<p>"What if she hooks up with a thief?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no wonder I lost two washcloths the other day!" A woman with a freckled face exclaimed, stirring her pot. Then everyone became nervous, and a proposal for expulsion was immediately passed in the feelings of disgust and worry of the owners. So on this morning, she had to pack up all her property (which was so meager that it was like a bit of irony to our laws... because she only had a broken bowl and some cotton wool like a fishing net), leave this alley, walking in her solitary way through the alley, amidst the ridicule of the people, under the impartial sunshine... (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e236">Gold and Silver Prices Suddenly Drop, Gold Price Rises 7.8 Yuan <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose due to the plunge of American silver, but forecasts suggest it may rebound. The daily situation was relatively soft. In the morning, overseas silver markets rose in British currency but contracted in American currency. The Far East Gold Exchange's forward silver price plummeted by 9.5 to 1.24 cents. Exchange rates were flat. London bullion fell 1 penny. American cotton fell 24 points per pound. American wheat plummeted 4.625 points. Stocks fell 1.47 yuan. The wool market opened and immediately soared by more than 10 yuan, then rose to over 70 yuan before falling. However, Reuters reported that the U.S. Speaker of the House, Rayburn, stated that silver legislation was not included in the implementation process in the current Congress, and that President Conant was only willing to continue to provide purchasing power under the London agreement. Still able to rise, so after opening, it once rose to 70 yuan. Subsequently, Reuters reported that the U.S. Senate Special Silver Committee unanimously agreed to immediately pass silver legislation, and the announcement caused a decline, but it mostly hovered. The domestic market gradually loosened, and morale turned weary. The gold price gradually fell. The after-market initially rose due to large purchases, but Seattle's overnight silver market fell and then recovered, so the gold market stabilized and then weakened. Overnight predictions suggest that American silver will inevitably rebound, and many sellers have moved to offload, but the trend ultimately feels favorable for the multiple positions. Although there was a setback, there was much struggle. The red gold price was 984 yuan, with a swap discount of 7 yuan. Here is a record of today's market situation:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 969 yuan, an increase of 11.8 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 9.1 yuan. The exchange market opened with the recent selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 0.0625, and American exchange at 34.5 yuan. Zhengjin bought August U.S. dollars at 34.8125. Shengda, Yida, Yonggan, Chang, and Xiang all made progress, rising from 8.8 yuan to 70 yuan. Yuqing, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Yifeng, and Yong took the opportunity to sell high, retreating to 8.5 yuan. However, it was rumored that HSBC's listing contracted 0.125 in British currency and 0.25 in American currency, still struggling. Macgary and Mitsui both blocked June U.S. dollars at 0.625. Dadecheng, Yida, Yongsheng, Dahengxing, Yuqing Yong, etc., sold even to 7.6 yuan and slightly stabilized. Yuqing, Yongyi, Dayong, Chang, and Xiang advanced, and then rebounded to 8.4 yuan. However, Hengxing and Yuqing Yong supplied repeatedly, and morale could not hold. Shanghai released August U.S. dollars at 9.375. Shengda, Zhaofeng, Changfu, Changyuan, Mao Yongfu, Xingyong, Bingxing, Shunli, Dingkang, etc., jointly supplied, so it fell to 5.6 yuan. The domestic market continued to strengthen. Wanxing came forward, rising to 6.3 yuan. The noon close was 966.1 yuan, with goods bid at 6 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 965.9 yuan, with goods opened at 6 yuan. Heng, Yu, Gan, Chang, Xiang, Fuchang, etc., all advanced, gradually rising to 7.7 yuan. The overnight silver market reported a drop of 140 points. Yifeng Yongheng, Changyong, and Yuan also sold heavily, retreating to 7.1 yuan. Fuchang, Dadecheng, Senchang, and Yong all advanced, again rising to 7.6 yuan. However, with the exchange market calm, Yuqing Yongyi, Dayong, Fuxing Yong, Shengyong, Dahongli, etc., sold one after another. It was said that the overnight silver market rebounded by more than 40 points, then retreated to 5.2 yuan. Shanghai released July U.S. dollars at 8.75, and August at 35 yuan. Zhifeng Yong Yuan, Mao Yong, Yingfeng Heng took advantage of the low prices, rising to 5.8 yuan. Soon after, Hengxing, Yuanchun, and Hengtai continued to sell fiercely, and the close fell to 965 yuan, with goods bid at 4.8 yuan. The highest price of the day was 970 yuan, and the lowest price was 965 yuan, with a fluctuation of 5 yuan. As a result, it rose 7.8 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was due to HSBC's listing of American exchange contracting by 0.25, to 34.125 yuan, and the combined standard gold price of 1,013.92 yuan, which at the closing price, pressed about 49 yuan, not much different from the previous close. The registration price for this month is 975 yuan, 974 yuan for May, and 966 yuan for June. The water supplement in the morning was 975 yuan, and the water supplement in the afternoon was 974 yuan. The red gold price was 984 yuan. The red market situation was calm, because swap transactions lacked wholesale volume, so the Tianjin gang situation was silent. Inside the market, only the silver shops sold a small number to Yingfeng Heng, adding 16 yuan. The Guangdong gang sold 985 fineness to Yingfeng Heng, adding only 10.05 yuan, about 400 taels. Swap transactions were not many, and the situation was boring. The initial bid was around 8 yuan, but there were no opponents. Then Yicheng, Yuan Mao Yongfu, etc., paid Yifeng Yong 7.2 yuan, and then Fengda, Dadecheng, and Yifeng Yong paid again to 7 yuan. In the after-market, Shunli and Yingfeng Heng paid Gan Changxiang still at 7 yuan. In addition, it is feared that there were only scattered transactions. As of today, there are only 56 tickets left for this month. On the 18th, Dafeng Heng redeemed 56 public tickets, and Yingfeng Heng took them in. There are 9,030 tickets left for May.</p>
<p>Trading inside the market was flat. In total, Shunli Hengxing, Wanxing, Fuxing Yong, Dadecheng, Chang Sheng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Dekang Xiangfeng, Zhifeng Yongda, Changxiang, Xianghe, Yingfeng Hengxie, Xingyong, and Tongfeng Hengyuan Yishengda were on the selling side. Fuchang, Cuitai, Hengchang, Yongda, Cheng Tianfeng, Hengtai, Ruixing, Qingfa Yongyi, Dayong Shunmao, Tongchun Zhaofeng, Changtong, Yi Tongfu, Ruikang Fuyu, Dafa Yongshen Changyong were on the buying side. Yuqing Yong Yongde, Futai Heng, Bingxing advanced and then exited, and Yifeng Yongheng Yuanyuan Mao exited and then entered. The Dalian gang Wanxing made more than 2,800 tickets, settling more than 100 tickets. Shunli made more than 2,100 tickets, settling more than 600 tickets. The Guangdong gang Shengda advanced about 500, exiting more than 700. Hengxing advanced more than 100 tickets, exiting more than 800 tickets. As of today, there are 18,900 chips for June, with a total of 52 long positions and 50 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 43,645 in the morning and 16,345 in the afternoon.</p>

Compared to the previous close, British pounds tightened by 0.125 and US dollars tightened by 0.3125, which was also due to Reuters reports of obstacles to silver legislation. After the opening, it was calm at first. The HSBC exchange rate was announced, British pounds shrank by 0.125, and US dollars fell by 0.25. Afterwards, the banks' appetite became constricted, the process gradually loosened, and besides swap transactions, there was a lack of trading in the after-market. The silver price in the Seattle night market initially fell and then rose, and the domestic market results seemed firm. By the close, the near-term selling price for British pounds was one shilling, four pence and 0.125, and US dollars at 34.625 yuan. Compared to the previous close, British pounds tightened by 0.0625, and US dollars tightened by 0.1875.

<h3 id="e238">Difficulties in the Development of the Banking Industry <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>This year, various industries have been affected by the trends of the times. Not only are they in a state of decline, but also the situation in various aspects is silent and stagnant. For example, the current silk cocoon and tea industries, which in previous years would have been thriving, are now facing a bleak future. According to recent investigations, people in the industry are afraid to engage in long-term business. The market atmosphere is declining, and the banking industry is only receiving and not lending. If this continues, there may be unimaginable consequences. It is observed that although the interbank lending rate in the morning and afternoon markets yesterday was slightly better at 2 fen, calculated at 5 fen, it is ultimately not a good sign due to the lack of smooth circulation. Adding water to the "劃頭" (a type of transaction) is calculated at 2 fen. The turnover of interbank drafts in the morning market was over 4.1 million, with new transactions over 200,000. The turnover in the afternoon market was over 400,000. The turnover in the Small General Association was over 500,000. The turnover of foreign mortgage transactions for taking and making redemptions was over 1.5 million. The receipt and issuance of banknotes was over 1.8 million. The collection and delivery of bills for Chinese banks was over 2.9 million. The collection and delivery of various goods, exchange, mortgage, tax, and miscellaneous funds was over 3.9 million. The outflow from warehouses was 300,000. The collection and delivery of bills for foreign banks was over 1.8 million. The collection and delivery of various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous funds was over 4.2 million. Telegraphic transfers amounted to 400,000. The inflow into warehouses was 500,000. The collection and delivery of bills for Japanese banks was over 2.2 million. The collection and delivery of various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous funds was over 3.9 million. The collection and delivery of foreign public bonds for money shops was over 38 million. The collection and delivery of foreign exchange "劃頭" funds was over 5.7 million. Remittances from various routes amounted to 600,000. Cash delivery was 600,000 to 700,000. Customer source was 100,000. Clearing was 450,000. The total number of exchanges by the Shanghai Joint Reserve Committee's bill exchange house on the 17th was 8.1098344 million silver dollars, including 4.12433473 million silver dollars in cash and 3.98549967 million silver dollars in exchange drafts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver dollar (小洋) was 838 yuan in both the morning and afternoon, which was 2 yuan higher than the previous day's morning market and 1 yuan lower than the previous day's afternoon market. The turnover in the morning market was 7,500 jiao, and in the afternoon market was 4,000 jiao. The Guangdong small silver dollar was 750 yuan and 0.6 jiao in the morning market, which was 0.4 jiao lower than the previous day's morning market. The afternoon market rebounded by 0.2 jiao to 750 yuan and 0.8 jiao. The turnover in the morning market was 65,000 jiao, and in the afternoon market was 80,000 jiao. Copper coins remained at 325,500 wen, with a turnover of 31,899 strings, equivalent to 9,800 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Securities Market in a Phase of Consolidation Amidst Easing Political Situation <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Most transactions were swaps...Market fluctuations were limited. Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed a slight consolidation trend. Because major players were all engaging in swaps, with different choices, market prices fluctuated within a limited range. However, the "96" bond fell quite sharply. The political situation seemed to ease slightly due to Huang Fu's arrival in Shanghai and diplomatic developments. Various trading houses initially sold off intensely, but then stopped. However, a major player in the "96" bond had a large short position and the price was not low, so they deliberately sold more to suppress the price. But it still went up after going low, showing the stubbornness of the bulls. With the settlement date approaching, the competition between the two sides will surely be lively. At this time, the weaknesses of both sides have not yet been revealed. The morning opening yesterday was extremely chaotic, with highs and lows mixed, and a generally weak appearance. Most transactions were swaps. The "96" bond fell by 3 to 5 jiao due to the frantic selling by firms No. 4 and No. 46. The second round still felt inconsistent, with the front rows slightly firm and the back rows still weak. Firm No. 31 sold the "96" bond again, falling by about 7 jiao. The afternoon opening still showed supply exceeding demand on the trading floor. Only firm No. 53 entered the market to buy a significant amount of "Disbandment of Troops Bonds" (裁兵), which helped maintain the original price. The rest fell by 2 to 4.5 jiao due to firms No. 35 and No. 46 and others continuing to sell. The Salt Tax bonds were relatively firm because firm No. 4 had a unique appetite for them. The major players stopped selling the "96" bond, and it rebounded by about 3 jiao. The close was firm and steady, with a slight overall increase of 2 to 3 jiao. The situation was erratic. The final market prices showed that the "Troop Disbandment" and "1928 Customs" bonds were firm and slightly stronger, while the rest were mostly slightly lower by 1 to 2 jiao. The "96" bond was lower by about half a yuan. The closing time was 7 PM. The number of transactions was not inspected in detail, estimated to be about 20 million yuan. The high and low results are listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to the Wall Street Journal market report from Sin Fung &amp; Co., yesterday's stock market experienced a sharp decline, with the largest drop reaching as much as 16 yuan. President Roosevelt's opposition to silver legislation is tantamount to opposing inflation, causing silver prices to plummet. At the same time, the Chicago wheat May futures trading was about to expire, and the bulls were eager to get out, resulting in a miserable squeeze. It was rumored that a major speculator suffered irreparable losses. The market price drop was the largest this year. As a result, the stock market also loosened. However, there was a slight rebound before the close. The small exchange followed the stock exchange's decline. Bonds also weakened due to the stock market's loosening and the bulls closing positions, but the drop was smaller. A few bonds even rose against the trend. In addition, according to the report from our New York agent (securities), they fell due to the sharp drop in commodities, but rebounded later and showed good resistance. (Wheat) fell due to the bulls selling out. Washington's opposition to inflation legislation made buyers lack confidence. It can be bought when it falls again. (Cotton) The prospects for silver legislation and inflation are quite dim. Silver prices and 　prices were weak, and cotton bulls sold off as a result. The strike situation also had an adverse effect. When it fell, fellow traders and outsiders engaged in buying. (Silver) According to Rayner, the president's attitude was against silver legislation, and the market situation collapsed as a result. However, we believe that the drop was too large and expect it to rebound slightly tomorrow. The total daily turnover was 1.29 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is becoming more severe. The lowest closing price for the April contract of Manchu yarn (標紗) has been seen at 160.90 yuan. New lows are discovered every day. However, judging from the market situation, it is feared that the 160 yuan level will be difficult to maintain due to the thick inventory and foreign merchants selling off. Therefore, the bulls of a certain factory were also forced to close their positions by the sellers. The market became more and more slack. According to another message, it is said that Japanese merchants made profits and covered a lot of short positions in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(Manchu Yarn Fell Sharply by More Than Two Yuan) The Manchu yarn market opened in the morning, with the sharp drop in American cotton causing particular anxiety. Selling pressure rose sharply, with each month falling by 1.346 yuan. The afternoon was still sluggish, with each month falling by another 0.679 yuan to 1.13 yuan. The total daily turnover was 53,400 bales. It was found that the sales sources were: Yuan Da 1,100 bales, Ren Feng 1,600 bales, Yi Yu 1,150 bales, Yu Kang 2,150 bales, Jin Chang 　1,950 bales, Sen Kang 1,150 bales, Shun Da 1,050 bales. The purchases were: Heng Da 1,350 bales, Da Ji 950 bales, Yuan Da 1,600 bales, Da Feng 2,450 bales, Shen Ji 1,000 bales, Tong Xing 1,750 bales, Chang Feng 2,950 bales, De Ji 1,250 bales, Yi Cheng 1,000 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>(1,400+ Bales of Yarn Sold) Sales of spot yarn are still smooth. It was found that the total purchases by various firms for the day were 1,464 bales. Prices fell by 0.5 to 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Yunnan 315 Guangdong 45 North Firms 15 Nanjing 5 Mainland 220 Jiangxi 60 Shantou 2</p>
<p>The cotton market has fallen sharply, and the situation is quite weak. Because American cotton has been consolidating for many days, the spot price suddenly broke through the 1.2 fen level. As a result, the bull camp was agitated, and the sellers took advantage of the situation to sell off. The market fell sharply, and people were slightly panicked. Foreign merchants also closed their positions. However, the Guangdong firms continued to absorb a lot in the futures. The future depends on foreign cotton.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Fell by 6 to 7 Jiao) The Manchu cotton market opened in the morning, with the sharp drop in American</p>
<p>cotton causing anxiety. The selling pressure was particularly strong, with each month falling by 4.5 to 7 jiao. The afternoon was close to falling by 1 jiao, and the distant months rose by 0.5 fen. The total daily turnover was 127,500 dan. It was found that the sales sources were: Chang He 5,500 dan, Rui Da 3,700 dan, Tai Chang 2,700 dan, Tong He 1,300 dan, Da Fu 2,200 dan, Ming Hua 1,700 dan, Tong Ji 2,100 dan, Xie Sheng 1,300 dan, De Ji 1,300 dan.

<p>(Factory Demand is Only 800 Bales) The current cotton demand has turned slightly dull. The sources of supply are: Xin Yao cotton 187 bales, Tong cotton 804 bales. The current cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 47.00 Feng Tian Factory bought 00 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory</p>

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market fell due to crowded domestic arrivals, weakness in the Shanghai market, and bulls closing positions. As a result, spot prices fell by 30 points, and futures prices fell by 22 to 28 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 1 point. The Bombay cotton market fell due to European exporters selling and bulls closing positions. As a result, Pingal fell by 0.5 rupee, Omra fell by 1 rupee, and Bai Luoxi fell by 1 rupee and 2.5 jiao. The original telegrams are recorded on the left (16th telegram).</p>

<h3 id="e244">Grain Quiet and Weak, Flour <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, turned flat and weak again. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, fell sharply by 1.45 yuan because the president opposed inflation. Canada also fell by a small 0.120 yuan. When the price opened, people naturally saw it as flat. However, in the current market, most manufacturers are watching and do not want to hedge sell. Therefore, although the environment is not good, the degree of decline is not significant. Otherwise, a sharp drop would be unavoidable. When the market opened in the afternoon, the atmosphere of each month was still flat. However, manufacturers' selling was lonely, and customer appetite was also inactive. Therefore, under mutual exclusion, transactions were not smooth. As for the current flour going to the military ship, it has been loosened, and it has only risen by 0.03 yuan according to the standard. As a result, this month was slightly smaller by 0.01 yuan, May and June were smaller by 0.005 yuan, July was smaller by 0.0075 yuan, and August and September were smaller by 0.005 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Futures Wheat in a State of Stagnation <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, each month was stagnant. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, fell sharply by about 1.45 yuan, and Canada fell by a small 0.120 yuan, the market remained calm and unchanged due to the economic decline in the country, and domestic and foreign buying and selling could not attract its attention. Only July and August saw some active trading, and the rest were rarely opened. As a result, August was slightly smaller by 0.01 yuan. The current wheat market is still standing. Arrivals are gradually imported, and the quality is good. Because new goods are approaching, old goods must be sold. The opening price of Yingzhou wheat was 3.43 yuan, Guzhen wheat was 3.54 yuan, Bengbu wheat was 3.40 yuan, Yaowan wheat was 3.56 yuan, and 0.05 yuan, Nansuzhou wheat was 3.50 yuan, a total of 6,000 bags, which were handled by Shen Da Hua Feng.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Central Customs Late Rice Shows Well <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) The sources of various firms are relatively rare, totaling nearly 30 (over 5,000 stones). On the sales side, the customer firms are still able to continue smoothly. Only late rice is moving, and thick japonica rice is also being purchased. The market shape is quite lively. However, in recent days, the customers from Nanyang are in the main venue, and their intention is to focus on the goods from the Central Customs and seek those with heavier qualities. The current shape is only better for those from the Central Customs. The high-priced goods are only slightly taken by the Northern Customs, and those who handle thick japonica rice also want to seek heavy qualities. The Nanyang Customs are moving, and the two customs have a total of 2,500 to 2,600 bags. The prices of Xilian Fengjing goods and others continue to rise by 0.05 yuan, and the Qingjiao Songsi and other major markets follow slightly by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. The prices of Chongte and Zente are stable. The appetites of various thick japonica rice stores are still ordinary. And the situation of goods such as Nangang is soft. The supply and demand of Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan are similar, and they are still flat.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 35 to 36 ships came from various places in He Xia. The sales of white japonica, sheep Du Kejian, and white yuan were moved to the river in Jiang Donghua. Early thin rice, Bu Jian, and zero appetite were quite stagnant. The market prices of white japonica, sheep Du Bu Jian, and early thin rice were flat and weak. The prices of Bian Kejian were firm. Yin Yuan goods were scarce and there was no market.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Hunan Rice Arriving Gradually, One Customer is Turning Light, Market Prices are Maintaining <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market, customers were slightly interested, but the entire batch transaction has not yet started. Although the cargo owners are willing to depreciate the price to seek sales, but because local customers have no large ticket interest, it is not cost-effective to depreciate the price and sell cheaply in retail transactions. Therefore, they still hold on to the insistence. The Tongshi opened 300 bags of Hunan machine 礱 rice, 1,250 bags of Shashi machine milled rice, and 100 bags of Nanjing machine Xian rice. Most of them are still handled by the Min Province. Wenzhou and Benjie only deal with each other. The prices are similar to the previous market, but yesterday's arrivals are active, especially from Hunan. Yesterday's two batches of arrivals were mostly machine red rice, totaling more than 4,000 bags. Other machine yuan, machine oil, and rough rice were only slightly seen as embellishments.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Soybean Consumption Greatly Declining <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Soybean sales are much worse compared to the end of last week, due to the fact that manufacturers are all taking a wait-and-see attitude, and other firms are also lazy and indifferent, resulting in a softening of people's hearts. Fortunately, the source is not surging, and market prices are still stable. It is difficult to grasp the future situation. It is estimated that more than 300 bags of Feihe beans were transacted, and the price was 2.72 to 2.77 yuan, which were divided by the local and Fuzhou firms. One car of Zhengyangguan beans was priced at 2.75 yuan, which was taken by the local firm. In addition, the mainland handled 600 bags of Jiujiang Poyang beans, and the price was 2.51 yuan. Three hundred bags of Sha Huang were opened, and the price was 2.85 to 2.88 yuan, which was taken by the Guang firms.</p>
<h3 id="e249">The North-South Golden Needle Vegetable Market is Calm <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the Golden Needle Vegetable market has been slightly active, with Quanzhou and Guang firms purchasing. The stock numbers, opened by the firm a few days ago, were more than 50 bags. The price was from 15 yuan to 14.8 jiao to 14.2 jiao. Now it is found that the stock in the Shanghai bottom firm is less than 1,000 bags. That is, there are only more than 400 bags in Zhenjiang. However, the actual sales have not been smooth, and the condition is still flat. The most recent selling prices are listed below: Daxing Vegetable 15.5 yuan, Top Village Vegetable 17 yuan (out of stock), Xiang Village Vegetable 15 yuan, Yanghua Vegetable 15.3 jiao, Zhongxing Vegetable 14 yuan, Suqian Vegetable 14.5 yuan, Xuzhou Vegetable 14 yuan (out of stock), Bozhou Vegetable 13 yuan</p>
<h3 id="e250">Silk and Tea, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Spring Silkworms are Hatching in Sequence <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>(Guangdong Silk Actively Lowering Prices for Dump Sales) Overseas Guangdong silk sales have been almost completely invaded by Japanese silk. The Guangdong silk warehouses are filled with silk, and the foreign silk sales have almost stagnated. Therefore, they are all transported to Shanghai to sell to the silk merchants. However, the prices of European and American silk have been falling continuously. The silk factories are watching and not moving forward, and they all buy with a small price. Recently, the spring silkworms in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been hatching in sequence, and the spring cocoons will be seen soon. Guangdong silk merchants are actively lowering prices for dump sales. In the most recent ten days, (from April 1st to 15th), Shanghai and Hangzhou silk factories, such as Jin Yun and Xin Feng, purchased more than 180 boxes of new-style Guangdong white factory silk, (80 catties per box), which were sold by Guangdong silk merchants Yishun Sheng and others. Most were 20 to 22 filature, and the price was only 380 to 390 yuan. The 14 to 16 filature thin filature was also sold for only 410.20 yuan.</p>
<p>(Yellow-White Coarse Silk Printing Sales Decreasing Daily) The yellow-white coarse silk produced in Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, Shandong and other provinces has always been sold to India. Recently, due to the world economic recession, Indian silk sales have been degrading daily. In the most recent half month, (from April 1st to 15th), each Indian firm (i.e. white head foreign firm) only purchased 38 packages of yellow-white coarse silk. The export was also only more than 300 packages.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Hardware, New Arrival of 2,000 Boxes of German Tinplate <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Although the business of German tinplate has not been as smooth as American iron recently, it has felt much more progressive than British goods. However, due to the scarcity of sources, the bottom goods often suffer from the pain of being crowded and lacking. Yesterday, 2,000 boxes of new goods arrived, so those who need to handle this cargo competed to get delivery. Therefore, the market has already thrown out 400 to 500 boxes yesterday. The price of 90-pound single-link is estimated at 15 yuan, and the double-link opens at 30 yuan. One hundred-pound single-link opens at 15.5 yuan, and double-link opens at 31 yuan. It is found that most of the purchasers are local can factories.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Lead Brought High Due to Tea Merchants' Purchases <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>The transaction of lead was very good yesterday. As the time for new tea to enter the market is approaching, tea merchants are buying lead to make tea boxes. Therefore, the transaction has been very lively for consecutive days. However, the arrivals are not many and the existing stock is also thin, so the market's sentiment is particularly strong. The standard has risen sharply, and each dan can be estimated at 15.25 yuan, which is better than before. It is heard that tea merchants from Anhui, Jiangxi, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Fuzhou have been in contact to purchase, so the market is increasingly bright. In addition, printing houses and tin foil factories are also interested, so the market is likely to rise and not fall.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Beauty Trap <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Japan's diplomatic tactics can truly be described as "constantly innovating" and "nothing is too strange." First, they use the facade of friendship to deceive the world, fabricating stories out of thin air to confuse public opinion. Then, they resort to vile actions to lobby various countries, showering them with sweet words and flattery to the best of their ability. Further on, they expose their ferocious nature and implement decisive measures. Nothing could be more despicable and contemptible!</p>
<p>Recently, those directors of world dramas are again stirring up trouble, adding fuel to the fire to expand the stage for their performance. Whether it's a comedy or a tragedy, we should watch closely. Ultimately, they are wielding both carrot and stick, employing their clever and treacherous political and diplomatic tactics. Taking advantage of the military and political turmoil in various countries, they are simultaneously plotting the permanent annexation of the entire North China region and striving to ease tensions with Soviet Russia and attempting to connect with the United States, while also sabotaging US-Russian reconciliation. However, this plan ultimately failed, and their underhanded schemes were unable to proceed, leaving them with nothing but futile sighs. Yet, who knows if they will change their strategies to realize their dreams?</p>
<p>Previously, Japan's instigation of African independence was also one of their subtle and cunning diplomatic maneuvers, but it too soon ended in failure. However, they are determined to uphold the motto that "failure is the mother of success." Therefore, even though they have repeatedly failed, they are not discouraged. They continue their efforts, determined to satisfy their ambitions. As such, they have recently launched a full-scale diplomatic campaign, lobbying, co-opting, sabotaging, and engaging in activities in every corner of the world and without regard to any detail. Their numerous schemes and ugly behavior are both pitiful and hateful! In April, newspapers reported: "A dispatch from the China United News Agency on the 2nd stated that the Abyssinian royal family in the black African country wants to marry a Japanese woman as a candidate for Empress. Ms. Masako Kuroda, the second daughter of Viscount Kuroda, has been chosen. This policy is similar to Kawashima Yoshiko's marriage to the Mongolian prince, albeit with different methods. The Japanese military and political circles have high expectations for this. However, due to numerous obstacles, the 'beauty trap' failed. Japan claims that Italy secretly prevented this from happening, and the Abyssinian Foreign Minister had no choice but to cancel the engagement." From this, it is clear that the Japanese's conspiracies and schemes are obvious everywhere, and there is no need for further elaboration. However, I recall that Kawashima Yoshiko's offering to the Mongolian prince was also a similar tactic. Who knew that this time, Italy would obstruct the plan, causing their "beauty trap" to fail? One can imagine how bitterly they resent Italy.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that Japan shipped a large number of plants to the United States, secretly containing a large amount of potent toxins. However, the US authorities discovered this and detained the shipment, preventing their plot from succeeding. However, their sinister and cruel intentions are evident from this incident.</p>
<p>After the puppet of the Northeast, Pu Yi, ascended the throne in the so-called "Manchukuo," the Japanese immediately offered him several beautiful Japanese women for entertainment, to alleviate his loneliness. Their affection is truly considerate in every detail. However, what is their true intention? Is it goodwill, or is there another purpose? It is not difficult for us to discern their underlying motives. They are using the lure of beauty and pleasure to monitor Pu Yi's actions, preventing him from stepping out of line. The depth of their scheming and the meticulousness of their planning are beyond the comprehension of our ignorant countrymen! Alas!</p>

<p>— Bei Bei</p>
<p>One early morning, the golden sunlight, gently, shone on the two floor-to-ceiling windows with their thin square grilles at the front of a bedroom! The thin wire mesh, plated with nickel, allowed one to vaguely make out the tiny squares through the inner silk gauze curtains, like a pattern painted by a great artist!</p>
<p>Outside was a small courtyard, planted with many red and yellow wintersweet flowers! The ripe fragrance was released, filling the quietness. From the gridded long windows, passing through the extremely thin silk gauze, the whole room was filled with that fragrance!</p>
<p>Next to the window was a newly purchased "Simmons" spring sofa. At this moment, it was crowded with piles of candy and the discarded wrappers. There was also a pair of pure goatskin gloves, with slender fingers! One could guess that they would not fit just any man.</p>
<p>A small mirror inlaid with a large square was also present!</p>
<p>In the eastern corner was a small triangular dresser, covered with a patterned tablecloth. On top of it was a large "RCA" radio, its power cord snaked out, with the plug inserted but not removed!</p>
<p>Next to it was a pair of small "armchairs," close to the bed.</p>
<p>The bed was open and disheveled, almost in the middle of the entire room!</p>
<p>The circular canopy, hung down from the very center, and was tied at the bottom with a red silk knot!</p>
<p>Warm spring has arrived! It is melancholy! Because its mistress is out of sorts.</p>
<p>The mistress, the intelligent mistress丨Miss Cherry Blossom! Was wrapped up in a milky white quilt.</p>
<p>The little angels' bell had just rung six times. It was still so early!</p>
<p>Little Plum also hadn't gotten up yet. Sleeping in the back, in the small iron</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>If they can’t bring themselves to die, they enact a suicide scene. They (or she) see suicide as the only escape, the only way to resolve all their issues.</p>
<p>In the past month, several tragic suicide cases have occurred on campus…</p>
<p>One rainy evening, the resident advisor was taking roll call. Miss × was missing from her dormitory. Her suicide note was discovered in the disciplinary office the next evening. It read roughly as follows:</p>
<p>“...Being alive, I cannot find the joy of life, only its bitterness. Therefore, I shall throw myself into the vast and boundless sea, following the surging waves. Ah! The world is a grand stage, and everyone plays a role. I have acted in a tragedy, so I will be the first to leave the stage. Life, love, money, these remain unsolvable mysteries. Ah! Mysteries, the taste of love I have already tried, and tried several times, but I have failed. Their flavors are bitter and spicy... Farewell, my teachers, my friends...”</p>
<p>From this, we know that she went to commit suicide, and we infer that she must have thrown herself into the sea or the Huangpu River. Therefore, the students at school had a new topic of conversation. Several students, known for their nosiness like detectives, told me the following:</p>
<p>"Miss × gave the gatekeeper three yuan, so the gatekeeper let her leave without permission..."</p>
<p>Hearing about the gatekeeper taking money on the sly, an inexplicable sense of revulsion rose in my heart, so I interrupted the student and exclaimed loudly, "What's the big deal about the gatekeeper taking money on the sly? Didn't Miss × tell me personally that she paid the gatekeeper two yuan for the convenience of leaving? And didn't ×× give him six dimes to go see a movie? There are so many things like this!"</p>
<p>"That's right! The school staff only think about 'getting a cut,' taking money on the sly and slacking off. The school only cares about collecting tuition and ignores everything else. Students make dates to see movies and engage in romance, putting their studies behind them. Ah! This is the life of professors, students, and staff in a university! But now I will tell you more about Miss ×'s affair! It is said that Miss × had been in love with three men, but she abandoned them due to her insatiable vanity, causing herself suffering and ending up in this state."</p>
<p>Miss ×'s tragedy clearly exposes the internal contradictions of the youth of this era. Ah! Contradictions, people live in such contradictions.</p>

<p>(II)</p>
<p>Sixth Master returned home and went straight to his wife's room, but she wasn't there. He turned around and went to the small dining room in the back, where his wife and daughter-in-law were waiting for dinner. Sixth Master didn't say a word, just ate his food, his face no different than usual. The daughter-in-law stood beside him serving him, naturally not daring to say a word. Sixth Master's wife had originally wanted to speak but didn't dare given the situation. The servants, such as the maids, the old nannies, and the old servant Pu Ning, didn't even dare to cough. It was raining softly outside the eaves.</p>
<p>Sixth Master suddenly stopped eating, looked at his wife, and said,</p>
<p>"That beast is back. I don't want to see him. Don't call him to see me! It's not right for him to live in the house. If he has nowhere to go, the new house in the back is empty, tell him to live there." He glanced at Pu Ning and said, "Pu Ning is enough to accompany him!" After eating a few bites, he said, "A karmic debt from a previous life, to give birth to this child who harms his parents!"</p>
<p>His wife replied, "It's truly a karmic debt! He doesn't dare to see you either, no need to be angry. This kind of child who harms his parents only causes me grief and doesn't give me any blessings. I don't want to see him either!"</p>
<p>The daughter-in-law felt saddened that she had married such a husband who didn't earn money or gain fame to honor his parents, instead causing his parents to hate him. Her nose twitched, and tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>After dinner, Sixth Master went to his wife's room to wash his face and instructed the maid drawing water to ask his wife to come. Sixth Master picked up his wife's water pipe and smoked, and when his wife entered the room, she asked what was the matter. Sixth Master didn't immediately speak, and his wife, thinking he was angry, didn't dare to ask further and went to wash her face. After she washed her face, she sat on a chair, watching Sixth Master pacing back and forth in the room.</p>
<p>Sixth Master suddenly stopped, and said indignantly,</p>
<p>"Do you still want this son?"</p>
<p>"Do you still want this son?"</p>
<p>His wife became somewhat saddened, her voice nearly choked with tears,</p>
<p>"I've already lost hope in him! Raising him for over twenty years, not a single day has passed without causing me grief. He was sick when he was a child, and now he's causing trouble outside! Even though he's back now, the officials still want to arrest him, and the family will lose money again! A child who harms his parents, how can I hope he'll support me in my old age?... But my second son, Jianming, is still young, and I don't know how he'll turn out in the future. Why is my life so bitter!" As she spoke, tears streamed down her face!</p>
<p>Sixth Master said, "Jianming seems to be following the rules and studying hard in Shantou. Of course, I hope for more good sons, but one bad son is already too much! Now!" He raised his head and saw the maid standing by the door, shouting, "Get out!" The maid was startled and ran to the kitchen. "Now that this beast is back, whether we want him or not is in our hands! I've already discussed it with Second Master, we'll kill him ourselves!"</p>

<h3 id="e258">The Atmosphere and Local Color of Film <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Wu</p>
<p>I remember a film that seemed to be called "Scandals of England" (?) opened with an extremely dense morning fog, people moving in the haze*.</p>
<p>The fog is a characteristic of London, indicating that the film is set in London. But what followed was old-fashioned carriages on the streets of London*,</p>
<p>This, in addition to illustrating London, further illustrates the conservative nature of the British. In the fog, only a very small number*</p>
<p>Of pedestrians and cars were present, only the sound of a milk cart bell heard slowly approaching from afar, then slowly fading away. This allowed the audience to become drunk*</p>
<p>Enchanted in the poetic atmosphere of morning fog in the streets. As for using war as a background, it is of course possible to depict a war atmosphere filled with ominous sounds and panic*.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for a real war to appear. Even in war films, the terrifying atmosphere of war does not lie in the earth-shattering cannon fire*,</p>
<p>And the sound of machine guns like a string of pearls, but rather in the mournful whinnying of wounded horses during or after the war.</p>
<p>If Chinese films want to create a peaceful atmosphere of rural life, they often use willow ponds and the sounds of geese, which is of course possible. But I feel that if*</p>
<p>They can film a distant view of a vast plain with ripe grain filling the fields, followed by a close-up of an ox cart fully loaded returning*; Special attention should be paid to the brilliant rays of the setting sun, shining on*</p>
<p>The side of the ox cart filled with grain. Followed by a close-up of the head of the farmer driving the ox cart; The sunlight paints*</p>
<p>A smile on the straw hat. Following that, a distant view of a small village with wisps of smoke rising from the chimneys, on a road, the ox cart gradually walks further and further, eventually*</p>
<p>"Fading out." If it is a sound film, then in the first long shot, the sound of field songs gradually comes closer, in the second close-up the singing is a little louder,*</p>
<p>In the third close-up, singing. In the fourth long shot, the singing gradually fades away again. This is not "a purely aesthetic appreciation of the free world without purpose"*</p>
<p>But rather "mixing the natural world with the people around it" (G. Nela Tofu's preface to "The Iron Flood"). This is more powerful than willow ponds and the sounds of geese by*</p>
<p>I don't know how much? If we want to strengthen the effect of the film, the atmosphere of the film is worth noting.</p>
<p>Similar to atmosphere but actually different is what is called local color. The dense fog of "Scandals of England" mentioned above is*</p>
<p>Is to express the local color of London. And in "Bringing Up Baby," the leopard, on the one hand, could express the power of the Queen, and on the other hand, it also*</p>
<p>Can express the local color of the Sahara. As for the famous film "The Golden Mountain," a woman eating sunflower seeds, this is even more indicative of the local color of the Caucasus*</p>
<p>The local color of the area.</p>
<p>If Chinese filmmakers want the audience to know the location where the story takes place, a slightly more sophisticated approach would be to use Sassoon House*</p>
<p>Etc. to represent Shanghai, the Temple of Heaven etc. to represent Beijing, and a more clumsy approach would be to simply use subtitles to explain. This has very little effect.*</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>In any case, form is always determined by content, and the method of creation is the basis of all art. "The natural world is only a frame for people-" "The natural world is not dead, not indifferent at all"; "The natural world is sometimes like a pastoral poem filled with gentleness and affection, and sometimes as frightening as thunder and lightning"; "Nature - this is a force, a force that directly participates in major and minor events, an untiring witness, a good friend, or a vicious enemy." (G. Nela Tofu's preface to "The Iron Flood") So to use*</p>
<p>The natural world to express local color, we should also express the dynamics of the natural world. The dense fog of "Scandals of England" is very*</p>
<p>Appropriately matched with the sound of the milk cart bell to weave a "poetic haziness." Simply introducing the Temple of Heaven or Sassoon House in a stiff manner is not*</p>
<p>It's useless. What's more, the fog in "Scandals of England" is still related to the plot. In the fog, seeing a woman not very clearly caused*</p>
<p>Misunderstanding. The woman eating sunflower seeds in "The Golden Mountain," in addition to expressing the local color, also expresses their leisurely mood at the time*</p>
<p>State of mind, not to mention the leopard's display of power in "Bringing Up Baby."</p>
<p>As for the same "existence," becoming two completely different atmospheres due to different methods of expression, there are more examples to cite. The*</p>
<p>The smokestack screen of "The Golden Mountain," because the camera is close to the smokestack and more smoke is captured, makes the audience feel the greatness and horror of the factory. The*</p>
<p>The smokestack in the domestic film "Oppression," because the camera is far away, includes the factory roof and because it is meant to show that the factory is closed and there is no smoke, gives people the impression*</p>
<p>The feeling of a landscape painting, I think if this shot were closer, in the picture it was a close-up of the top half of the smokestack*,</p>
<p>I think the audience would not have the feeling of a landscape painting.</p>
<p>Artists, give nature and life peace, only in this way can we achieve the best effect of atmosphere and local color.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e259">Review of "Spring Love" The Song You Gave Me - Guotai I <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fu</p>
<p>Upon seeing the title "Spring Love," it reminded me of the cartoon "Spring Outing" in a recent "Free Talk" column, and I smiled.</p>
<p>Love, love, love through and through, romance through and through.  It also carries a touch of melancholy. Perhaps, those dignified individuals who have been disappointed in love affairs will be moved by the Sentiment written with a light touch, but isn't this also a joke?</p>
<p>Because the playwright wanted to write a so-called lovely romance, he cleverly wrote this cinematic entanglement of men and women.  Indeed, the film fully utilizes the expression techniques unique to cinema (such as Bipitada Nair pretending to kiss others behind the door), making this romance very vivid and interesting.  Conversely, it could not be so fully expressed in literature.  Technique is always determined by content, and romance has its own unique techniques.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each actor appropriately makes this romance struggle to exist.  It is not only Bipitada Nair who has done her utmost; even the three supporting actors are directed in a very lively and interesting way.  Therefore, from all aspects, this "Spring Love" is not in the center of Rofnanism films, but it occupies its place and is a new type, which is not commonly seen in British and American films.  If someone is moved by it and then denies that it is romance, then we only need to consider the fact that the singer does not marry any of the people surrounding her, but instead unites with that rather impoverished opera performer – this is the playwright's greatest fantasy.  However, here lies the origin of the playwright's sadness: he sympathizes with the plight of the famous singer, believing that in all the world, only the unestablished musician truly loves her and understands her.</p>
<p>Currently, a small number of people consider film to be a "soft art," a term used very strangely.  It is explained that because the film is soft, the film can be without consciousness. Then I think this "Spring Love" should be most suitable for their taste.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the puppet show in the play is worth seeing. For the sake of theatrical research, we may wish to learn from it. As for what effect this kind of film will have on the audience in the current turbulent situation, I think it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e260">Regarding "Sports Queen" <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yue</p>
<p>Some people who have seen "Sports Queen" think that its main point is to break the championship system in the sports world and criticize the golden crown of the sports queen, which is very good. First of all, this gentleman does not understand the reason for the existence of the championship system, which has profound social reasons. The commodification of education has turned sports competitions into trademarks for commodities, used to appeal to their patrons, so there must be a championship system to encourage a group of warriors. The various corrupt and degenerate phenomena of modern society, economic bankruptcy, and political darkness, are placed in front of the students, shaking the hearts of most of them. Those with clearer minds are naturally very dissatisfied with this situation, so these students are hated by people, and many methods are used to disrupt the students' vision. "Sports" is one of them, using the championship system to strengthen the stimulation of sports, making it easier to complete the current task of "sports." On the other hand, the championship system itself is beyond reproach, but because the championship system is used in the current education system, which is fundamentally anti-progressive, general superficial observers always believe that the championship system should be broken, but they forget the anti-progressive nature of the current sports education.</p>
<p>This gentleman does not know this, and he has not seen what the author of "Sports Queen" wanted to say but dared not say explicitly. When the world war broke out, the people of various countries were deceived by what was called "glory" and sacrificed in vain, just like Qiu Hua sacrificed in the sports arena. On the eve of World War II, we should realize that so-called "glory" has nothing to do with the people, and the people should no longer sacrifice in vain. In front of the people is struggle and progress!</p>

<h3 id="e261">Impressions After Seeing "The Fugitive" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Li Tian</p>
<p>The impression that the film gives the audience is like a fleeting dream, disappearing like smoke, undoubtedly a failed production. Another kind of film not only engraves endless traces in the depths of your mind, but also further triggers your profound thinking. The "?" symbol constantly revolves in your brain; that is a successful blockbuster.</p>
<p>I don't like the so-called song and dance blockbusters that are full of carnal and fragrant scenes; I don't want to see the love story of talented scholars and beautiful ladies under the moonlight; I don't want to see wild beasts and natives being cruelly chased by civilized people. I eagerly hope that films with social significance will provide us with spiritual food.</p>
<p>"The Fugitive," in my mind, is a successful blockbuster and a film with social significance. It exposes the darkness and pain of prison life, the cruelty of the jailers, and the corruption of the prison system. We must know that this is a serious social problem!</p>
<p>Paul Muni is indeed a successful person in the film industry. His expression is not just on his face. In his whole body, there is a burning emotion of fierce resistance, a manifestation of the inner self.</p>
<p>Alan's two risky escapes are enough to make us hold our breath. The jailers' whipping of the prisoners reminds me of all the brutal systems in our country's prisons. Let's think about it, are prisons and laws the only way to bring prisoners back on the right track?</p>
<p>When Alan whispered to Helen, "I am leaving, and this life will end as a fugitive. Please don't think of me again!" Can one not be heartbroken as a fugitive? May I ask, who is to blame for the creation of fugitives?</p>
<p>The clanging of iron chains, the shouts in the mine, the sound of gunfire chasing, the barking of hunting dogs, and the whispers of farewell still echo in my mind. Paul Muni's profound performance and thought-provoking plot reappear before my eyes.</p>

<p>This play, after the efforts of Yuan Congmei and all the cast and crew, has completed nine-tenths of the entire drama. Now, only one interior scene remains. When this interior scene is filmed, the entire drama will be completed successfully.</p>
<p>It is said that the set for this scene is very grand, so it is necessary to increase the number of workers and it will also take some time to build. However, it is expected that it will be completed by the middle of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e263">Records of War Drums and Sword Shadows (Nana) (7) <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Ming</p>
<p>Nana said frankly: "I have nothing to say. I don't think there is anything shameful about my love. To ask me to deny my love or apologize for my love is to blaspheme and despise it. Greina, no matter what you scold me, I can never blaspheme or despise my love." The old man shouted furiously: "See what you are without me. Get out! Get out!" Go to the street! Without Greina, don't even think about having a place to eat. You try!" Nana slowly walked to the door. When she reached the door, she turned back and said to Greina, "Thank you, Gejina, for everything you have done for me. I will always remember that my first meeting with the only person I love was in your theater." After she finished speaking, she quietly left.</p>
<p>Greina was not bad. He was a man of wealth and power. He used his money and power to make it impossible for Nana to find any work in all the theaters in Paris. At first, she sold some of the jewelry she had brought with her to make a living, living in a dilapidated small house, while her old friends, Mimi and Sanding, still relied on her. Not only Mimi and Sanding, but also Su Yi lived with her, because Greina determined that she must also be an accomplice and fired her. Returning to a life of poverty, Nana didn't care much. She treated this arrival of frustration just as she had treated the arrival of success not long ago, calmly and without surprise. After some time, she seemed to have forgotten the glory of the surging sound and applause in the theater. There was only one thing that made her feel uneasy day and night... That was that after George left, there was no news at all. She wrote many letters to him, but it was in vain. Now she was sitting at a broken desk again, writing a letter... She always hoped that this letter might get a reply. After she finished writing, she raised her head and said sadly to Mimi, "I really don't understand... Even if we had a quarrel..." Mimi took the letter and asked her, "Poor baby, don't try to understand it. I'll mail it for you." Nana gave her a sad smile and said, "Yes, Mimi, thank you."</p>
<p>As soon as Mimi took Nana's letter and walked out of the room, she was stopped by Su Yi. She asked, "Is it another letter to George?" Mimi said, "Yes. I feel like I've committed some crime, always destroying other people's letters, and I feel uneasy. And George's letter, did another one come today?" Su Yi said, "Yes, another one came today. I'm already ashamed. This is a very difficult thing, and I know it. But someday she will be grateful to us. This matter probably won't last long. She's about to give in. She'll be with someone else soon." Mimi said, "George doesn't have much money. How can he support her? So as long as she can understand in her heart and find such a person, take out some money to enable her to return to the stage, then Greina will have to watch and there's nothing he can do." They secretly discussed like this, thinking that by that time, they could all enjoy endless pleasure again. (To be continued)</p>
