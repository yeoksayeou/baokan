<h3>時評　中越商約亟應復活　廷</h3>
<p>法使韋禮敦氏。昨日由平抵。京有與我國我外交當局續談中法越南商約之。説按遜淸光緖十三年（一八八七）年間訂結之中法越南邊界通商章。程早於民國十五年八月滿期。其後迭與法方交涉續訂新。約而法方則藉詞推。託遲不肯行。直至十九年五月。［中法規定越南及中國邊省關係專約］始告成。立約成後。我國卽予批准。而法方旣經簽訂。又復異議。蓋該約内容。大體上尚與我國有利。法人乃以中越懸案尚待解决及中越來往貨物税率表尚未訂妥爲藉口。不肯迅卽批准。自我國征收洋米入口税後。法方更以爲越米輸華大受影響。必須减低税率。作爲交换條件。我國不允所。請以致雖有新約而無法實行。</p>
<p>以前中越通商章程。本有華貨入越享受特别優待税則之規定。舊章於十五年滿期。越南政府自十八年七月起。卽取消華貨入口特别税則。以對待無約國之最高新税則施諸華貨。據本年八月間旅越僑商報告。當地抽收華貨税率。有增加十倍至數下倍者。以是大宗運越華貨。如絲織品。顧繡。磁器爆竹等幾至完全絶跡。華僑工商業。乃有破産之虞。一般僑民旣無條約之保議。又受經濟之壓迫。因失對歸國或無力完納身税而被驅逐出境者。幾逹總數之半。卽幸而得苟延殘喘。亦不勝種種苛例之束縳。而無可奈何。今日如不迅與法方交涉批准新約。勢將使全體華僑無從立足。此不能不望我外來當局之能當機立斷也。</p>

<p>吾人以爲外交折衝。本非易事。而訂約之困難尤。甚惟訂雙方應各有其最低限度之希望。能逹到此希望。卽當引爲相當滿意。中越訂。約在我國立塲。當以保僑爲第一義。此點如能辦到。其餘皆可通。融今後當局與法使會商之。頃如法使仍以减低洋米入口税爲請。似不妨予同情之考虑。蓋洋進口征。税本應隨時變更辦法。在國内需要洋米時。税率自應减。低而在洋米價格極度高漲時。又應增高税率。甚或禁止進口。因時制宜本非一成不變者也。且廣東方面。對於洋米進口。征税較低。米商中有向越南西貢訂購糙。米運抵廣州加以辗白。然後轉滬銷售。而得漏税者可見征税一。舉本難完全推行。而况西貢輸出之米。半數以上實權均在華僑之手。减低貢米進口税。亦與當地華僑有益也。</p>
<p>此外我當局可爲法使告者。（一）我國與越南貿易。常處於入超地位。卽如本年年初四個月中。越貨之入超額逹。一千四百四十六萬元之鉅爲法人利益計應顧全我中國之友誼。而迅卽批准前訂之條約。（二）據十八年一月中法關税新約規定。兩締約國人民在彼此領土内。對於關税。内地税。或任何税項。享受平等待遇。同時又經聲明。此項待遇包括屬地。殖民地。及保護地在内故有此關税條約。在緃無十九年新約。亦不應對於華貨有所歧視也。</p>

<h3>來件　中國應取　何種方針應付世變　（續）</h3>
<p>章淵若講　（李光縢筆記）</p>
<p>我這種理論、或許一般人會以爲不可能、可是我敢肯定的説、這不是一個理論、確是一種現勢、也不是一種過於樂觀的空想、而是一種極其可能的推想論、凡是瞭解世界現勢深悉日本國情的人、都會作如是觀、我們若要戰勝日本、首應知彼知已、必須曉得日本的地位如何、透視到他們的心理、始克有濟、日雖横極侵中國、可是他們早就料到一九三六年的危機、委當必而恐懼這危機的降臨、而視爲最嚴重的國難時期、他們正是所謂外强中乾啊、最近日軍部在所發表的小册子、國防之本義及其强化之提倡的結讑中、就有同我所説一様的恐慌情形、可見這汪是我個人的偏見、所以他們現正積極從事於打倒中俄美英的聯合戰綫、而急爲進行防俄和美聯英的工作、（關於這層、是專門問題、今天不過將日本目前的策略、是如何在用盡心機、挑撥離間、使中國孤立無援、以遂其所慾、稍爲陳説而已、詳情當另爲講述、）所以我們現在當此危機緊迫之秋、能否安然渡過難關、則全視我們能否做到我這一個主張、我這一個策略以爲繼、這是一定呆以推想的、*</p>
<p>、講起中日外交的地位、我國本比日本爲優、不過、我們不能分析國際的情勢、不等利用有利於我的機會、致我國地位雖優、不能獲到一點利益、日本地位雖孤、因她善爲利用、反較我國爲優、這是很可育心的一件事、假如我們政府當局、能照我今天所講的原則、切實地定下方案、去节實推行、我想一定能有效果的、我們要曉得、國際間的外交、是没有是非、没有情感、没有貞操、没有正義的、有的、祇是利害、-支配着整個世界的形勢是經濟、（兄弟前在民智書局出版一書國際問題經濟的視察、説得很詳細、可請參閲、）决定一國外交策略的、也就是經濟和利害、我們從上述闡論中、已明瞭我國現在正處於極危難時期、我們要打破這個危機、就應切實明晰世界大勢、各國實際的利害關係、來確定我們的外交策略、從利害上去運用、取得有利的外交地位、一切幼稚的緃横捭闔、固屬幼稚、一切虚僞的酬聯絡、尤爲徒勞、　　（丁）我前面所講應付方針、其實還祇是治標的辦法、説到治本、則首在全國人民、能够［自力］）我近來提倡（自力主義、曾載本年十月十一月申新時事等報、）爲什麽要這様説呢、因爲外交既是祇講利害、如果我們要本没有力量、則列强豈肯與我結交聯絡、故根本上必須培植自已的力量、他們才會看得起我們、來和我們聯合、這是最最基本的條件、也是救亡圖存興民族的根本原則、（完）</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不能羞任敎平視西賓何足貴空辱虚心</p>
<p>賈多才也知道胡嫂子自已，未嘗不害臊，這是搭訕着説話。便指着靠門的那個方凳子，向他道：你就坐到這裏好了。説畢，可就帶了笑臉，又向月英道：囉—這裏邊有張椅子，坐下。説着，他把嘴向墻角落裏努着。顯然的，他對着月英，又是一副態度了。月英看了他那様子，更有些不好意思，只是低了頭，將右手去摩弄自已的紐扣。胡嫂子本來是坐下了，見他還是有害臊的様子。於是再站起來，拉住月英的袖子，向那邊空椅子上拖了去，笑道：你在家裏，什麽話都會説，怎麽到了這裏，一個字也不響？月英也不便僵持着站在這裏，随了他的手勢，向這邊的空椅子上坐來。依然是微笑着，没有答復一個字。賈多才對於風月塲中的事，本也有相當的經騐。但是所遇到的人，也都是風月塲中的人，自已有説有笑，他們也有説有笑。現在遇到了這位來自田間的姑娘，他一個勁兒的害臊，越鬧這情形越僵，因之他也感到没有了辦法，口裏啣了烟捲，背了兩手，只管在屋子裏來回的踱着方步。斜了眼看着月英，不住的噴烟。月英在這時，倒腾出了工夫來觀察這屋子：對面床上那床被單，首先就讓他驚異一下子，那白的底子，其白如雲，印的紅花，是有面盆大的朶子，這且不説，曾仔細的看了半天，却看不出這被單上面那裏有線縫，乃是一條整個兒的。看那被單下面，很是肥實，不知墊有多少棉絮或氈子。但看上面叠的蓋被，就是三床，下面是一條花綢子的，正中是一條黄綢的，上面又是一條綠綢子的。（八九）</p>

<p>張小子是個江北人，在吾們嘉定西城角裏，搭了兩間芧棚，遮蔽風雨，説起來：他的生活，株是拉車度日的；那末：這種下賤的資格，還有那一個去看他呢？然而他呌［張小子］，倒也實在不容易哪—因爲他，人人認識，他是個張小子，其實他同鄉中，明明呌他是張孝子。有一天，我有些不懂，就在一個賣水果的口中，得到這個緣故；他奉老母極孝，所以同鄉當中，没有人不呌他張孝子；但［孝］字，像念［小］字差不多，以致有許多人，不甚明瞭他，是個晚近社會上很可敬可嘉的人範哩！</p>
<p>據説：他的老母，年紀已經過了花甲，兩目不明，狀極龍鍾，他的妻某氏，在家與人洗衣，亦不像貧家的女流，奉事恭順，只生了一個兒子，方纔四齡，他的一家老小，平居餬口，實在是朝不保暮，專靠他夫妻倆一個用兩隻腿，一個用兩隻手來過活。唉！不料一天，張跌壞了膝蓋骨，遂至不能拉車，就此饔餮不繼，莫以能舉火，而他的妻僅存十指，也計無所出，眼看着老母，坐在牀上，因爲數日粒食没有到口，昏厥了多次，張不覺揮涙，暗地裏向妻説：［老母壽命已促，將奈何？妻答：［我那忍坐視，現在祇有一策，不曉得你允許否？］詢之，妻含涙而吐，［唉！與其使老母奄奄一息，坐以餓斃，聽汝抱恨終天，曷若將此無知的孩子，售與人家，以孫子之身，延祖母之壽，得非急救的一法麽？］於是他夫妻兩人，竟拿這四歲的兒子，得錢四十千，售在西門外同鄉的某船户，權當菽水承歡的過用物，後來張的脚病好了，仍舊度着拉車的生活，至今還侍奉他的老母，必恭必敬咧！　　喂—張孝子的名，也從此藉藉的在江北人們口中傳遍了；但［孝］字，都像念着［小］字，故我反他紀出來，也可見得［十室之邑，必有忠信，五步之内，必有芳草，一這句話；現在知道實在不是虚言啊。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （龍）</p>
<p>▲眞奇怪，情人當了面，他們的談話是講不完的，尤其是在别離後的情書裏。</p>
<p>▲一個人在夏天羡慕冬天好，到了冬天又羡慕夏天好，唯一般有産階級，纔没有這種矛盾的思想，尤其是上海的富豪。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>他雖然從不曾知道做一個皇帝的肩上該負怎様重大的責任，但他確也曾坐過朝，於是就有這麽一件小小的龍袍了。—袍是黄緞製的，上下左右，全是用金綫繡成許多飛龍，色調依然很鮮艷；當太后俯下身去，湊在盒蓋上，仔細張望的時候，裏面彷彿有一片光，隔着玻璃，反映到太后的臉上來。就爲着要使伊的兒子保持穿這一件龍衣的資格起見，在咸豐死去不久的當兒，太后確曾冒着绝大的危險，和四周的惡境齋鬭過：也就虧這一齋鬭，竟使伊老人家得以大權獨欖，睥睨當世，成爲歷史上一個罕見的女政治家。伊當日原是爲這一件小龍袍的主人而齋鬭的目的，後來却成就了伊自已：這結無疑的是等於失敗！</p>
<p>我們一起圍聚着細細地賞鍳這一件滿繡着金龍的黄袍，因此又發現它的衣領是用藍色的貢緞製的，還有幾顆龍眼大小的明珠釘着，華貴固然是華貴極了，然而小也小得可以了！從這件龍衣的大小推測起來，同治委實是一個很瘦弱的孩子。</p>
<p>他對於銅製的東西似乎有特殊的愛好。所以這裏收拾得很多；其中有一對小小的銅鼓，製作非常精巧。我想這一對鼓要如給一個精熟的鼓手打起來，它的音節之美妙。必非世界上任何一個鼓所能比擬的。但是它們的生命也已隨着它們的主人而結束了。將永遠一聲不發地在這些古宮中蜷伏着。（一九九）</p>
<h3>厭倦了人生</h3>
<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>現代潮流的趜向，什麽都趨重藝術化。對門的王家小姐，伊是在滬上某藝專畢業的，父母把伊培植到專科畢業，也算盡責了。因爲伊的父親只開設一片小洋雜貨店，供給伊數千元的學雜費，已够精疲力盡了。</p>
<p>可是王小姐在十七歲的時候，就在伊父母面前唱抱獨身主義了。原來伊從小就由父母作主替伊和陳家訂了婚，現在伊不滿於陳家有這許多造孽錢，向伊父親提出嚴重的抗議，責難伊父親爲什麽要把伊的自由主權用金錢的對象出賣？戀愛是否用金錢可以换得？</p>
<p>可憐！伊的父親是一個小商人，那裏及到伊的嘴厲害，鋒芒的吐詞，怎不使伊父親倒躱？</p>
<p>可是伊父親只知咆哮，只知揮拳，伊到底屈服伊父親的嚴威下，母親的慫恿下。</p>
<p>距離喜期不遠的某夜，伊竟仰藥自殺了！絶命書上只有［我厭倦了人生，再會吧！］數字，伊的父親見伊自殺了，很覺悲痛，悔當初没有聽從伊的要求，至有今日！</p>
<p>然而社會上一般人，還在議諷伊父親，説他何苦來，化了許多錢，只换得一個自殺的藝術化代名詞！厭倦了人生！，但是有學問的人仍很痛惜伊的遭遇！伊今年只二十一歲呢。</p>

<h3>乞賑之歌</h3>
<p>— （我本村人</p>
<p>都市的畸形發展反映出鄉村的日薄　過。救濟農村的呼聲，憑他高唱着，却只見農村的資金愈加涸竭；農村無業的衆競向都市推擠。有無地容身之苦。</p>
<p>杜工部　代詩豪。而妻兒不勉凍哸，現代託跡在都市的文人，爲着投合一般上層階級欣賞的口味，連直道民間疾苦的歌詠都不常見，我在村人，議我來學個［落葉秋蟬吟］議：</p>
<p>［都市肥，農村瘦；</p>
<p>都市香，農村臭；</p>
<p>都市艷，農村陋；</p>
<p>都市樓高摩將漢；農村十屋九破漏。</p>
<p>都市　　　　　，村婦　衣不覆肘。</p>
<p>都中當訴訟者逹實，誰見農村哮嘋嘋口！</p>
<p>莫做農村人，寗作都市狗。</p>
<p>吁麽乎，救濟農村唱入雲，潦餓盡餅何曾有！）</p>

<h3>太湖中的漁船生活</h3>
<p>— 倪尚龍</p>
<p>太湖是江南的巨澤，跨江浙兩省，共有八百多里的面積，烟波浩渺，雖没有滔天般巨大的風浪，倒也有些險惡，但是湖裏的水産物很是豐富，所以有很多靠羅網爲生的人，終年浮泛作家在湖上。</p>
<p>湖中共有可張七道帆的大漁船五六十隻，它</p>
<p>没有推進機，全憑風力而進行的，船身的大小，和行駛長江的商輪不相上下，每一船的價値，約在萬元左右，它終睥不攏岸邊，船上的人要想登陸，必須用舢舨過渡，這許多的船人，大都不是親，就是族，所以利害相共，都能互相聯絡。在捕魚的時候，兩船列成一排，各繫網的一端，曳足了帆，任憑風的勢力面向前推進。所捕得的魚，兩船均分，並没有爲了勞逸而有爭論多少的事情發生。</p>
<p>船上一年之計在於冬。第當朔風怒吼的時候他們莫不眉花笑眼，喜色相告，因爲魚類春孵而冬巨，且在極度的酷寒之下，已麻木得不能動彈，大都貼在淤泥中取温，船人趁此時候，着泥拖網，很不費力，又隨了狂風的勢力，迅速的向前推進，一夜可行二三百里，每日可得魚三四千斤不等。但他們所最可憂慮的，太湖雖廣而很淺，往往風雪過大，湖水忽凝結成冰，那末，他們一年中所懇切期望的生産，就付之虚牝了。</p>
<p>爲了上述的事情，所以他們對於天時預測的經騐，很是豐富，而有些也很正確；像今年的夏天大熱，據老於湖上的人説：［到冬天必定有大冷的天氣。］其他像三九逢月固，定必酷寒無疑。湖中的流沙湧悳將近湖膏。（湖水結冰，船人俗呼膏。）所以他們在冷天行船，見到湖中流沙湧起，水黏如漿，覺得船行凝滯，便將篙子蘸水而瀝之，倘使水滴滴難下，那末，知道就要湖膏，便迅速將船駛到有伙食可辦而各陽的山面附近，期待着春風來解凍。他們並且知道保時冰解，何日發東風或是東南風。而對谥晴·雨·風的變移，更瞭如指掌，但是大都只能預料而不明其理的。</p>
<p>凡是漁船上的男女，没有一個不啫酒的，這也是他們最普遍的啫好，所以登岸必飮，飮必盡量，就是在採辦糧食等東西的舢舨上，酒囊是一件不可缺少的點綴物。婦人和男人恰相反，他們都勤儉操作，絶無這種嗜好，並且在治餓之餘，還要結網裁衣。因爲環境然，没有一個女子不懂針綫的。到了冷天漁忙時候，伊們徹夜不睡，幫着男子們起網下網。</p>
<p>船上的婚姻，除了少數和陸上的居民結婚，大都是同類相偶的。船人登陸探親，必帶一些乾的或是鮮的魚蝦等送給親戚，但親戚也須回贈一些别的東西，不如此，以爲看不起他們，往往爲了這點而絶交的很多。凡是做兒女的親家，到了年底，必定拿五六十斤的年糕互相贈送，所以親戚多的人家，往往要做五六百斤以上的年糕。這也是一些厅異的風俗。</p>
<p>船上也有敎育，但他們的讀本，只是幾本百家姓，三字經，千字文，神童詩一等籠了。敎授的方法，和私塾一樣，完全取個别方法的。敎師由十數船全騁，膳宿供給，照每船上子弟的多少而輪洈的，他們待遇敎師，很是敬重，三餐之外，下午更辦點心，這是先生獨享的，並且隔二三日，必另外設宴，欵待先生，此外像衣服的洗濃和裁製，以及舖床，叠被，洗水烟筒等，都不領先生費心，自有學生家族留心和學生侍奉着，但束修很少，每年只有五六十元。</p>
<p>以上的種種的事情，都是我的老友（太湖東山人）講給我聽而爲出來的。</p>

<h3>翻譯的信與雅</h3>
<p>— 霜杰</p>
<p>近代意大利有名的美學家克洛司（Ｂ·Ｃroce）在他那本美學中説過這様的話：［已用美的形式造成的東西，我們可將牠用論理的形式再度表逹出來，但已具有美的形式的東西，却不能將牠改爲也是美的另一形式。翻譯的結果，或是减少及損壞原有的表現，或是把原有的表現放入溶爐中又滲和了翻譯家本人的印象，而創造出一個新的表現來……『忠實的醜女或不忠實的美女』這句俗語正説明了每個翻譯家兩難的局面。一他的意思是，如果我們在翻譯的時候不僅以原文的銓釋爲滿足，更進一步要求和原文一様之美的表現時，我們會落入進退維谷的地步。這種見解，在稍有過一點翻譯經騐的人看來，是决不會厭其誇張的。一個民族語言文字的産生與發展，是爲其最根柢的經濟生活所規定，經濟性質不同，民族心理及反映這心理的文化狀態然也面目各殊，欲求了解另一國的藝術已是不容易的事，何况更用審美的文字將它［適如其分］地表逹出來！</p>
<p>一個作者在他藝術衝動旺盛之時，那美的價値是完全的，等到這衝動在腦中形成一個明確的槪念時，這價値忆减去一分，在腦中把這槪念譯爲成形的文字再把它托諸腕書寫出來時，這價値又减掉一分，然而這只是它本來面目。等到另一國的翻譯家以另種生活習慣中培育出的頭腦透過語言和翳障來理解它，體會它，再把牠用另一種語言表逹出來時，這已與原作者的本意相去很遠了。如果翻譯家原作者的氣質生活環境及其所使用的語言有着深切的了解，並能自由驅使本國的文字，這還可給讀者看看原作的粗技大葉，否則真與原作差到十萬八千里。何况一個字不是孤立地存在，隱在這字後的是那一民族整個的縱的歷史與横的福會，在那一國的詞棠中，某一字究竟有着怎樣的涵養，其在人們心理中唤起的聯想是怎樣？都要給以明白的分析。這樣看來，翻譯的工作，縱不如克洛司所説的那樣不可能，至少是很吃力，很艱難，而應審愼從事的。</p>
<p>法國批評家居友説：［理想的直綫是從一點到另一點的最短距離，理想的文體也是從一人的心情到另一人的心情之最短的距離。一由這數學的與力學的槪念出發，斯賓塞卽説言語爲人們相互交通的機械，求一個字之位置得當去唤起讀者的心情，這是藉直觀與知覺以唤起或指導注意與聯想的問題。這在翻譯上也是如此。不繼地溶冶，锺錬，藻飾，以求兩種語言之勉强地貌合神似，把彼此的距離减少到可能的最小限度，這是翻譯家應負的責任，而當他做了如此地步時，他已美滿地完成他的任務了。</p>
<p>自從文學雜誌出版翻譯專號後，繼之而起的有譯文與民界文學兩個專此介紹外國文學爲職志的刊物，在［攻錯他山］的意義上説，國外作品的中譯，是只會嫌少不會嫌多的。然而我們要求的是良好的翻譯，縱不能有像茂德Ａlnier　Maude那樣在俄國陪伴了托兩斯太許多年再來動手譯述他的作品，但總不能把這工作看得過於輕易，希望一手拿筆一手翻字典地那麽把外國作品介紹過來。我們對於目前翻譯家的要求，説多了可以寫一長篇，説短了則不過是譯得［一方面有對得起原作者的忠實，一方面有對得起讀者的流利。］的一點不過奢的希望而已。</p>
<h3>東京一瞥</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>悶懨懨的坐在火車裏，偶而從窗外望出去：蔚藍的天幕下是一片廣闊無邊的田野，古老的農舍，半藏在碧綠的樹林中，天邊只見灰漠漠的一片烟雲，籠罩着淡淡的幾顆遠樹。</p>
<p>這一幅遼闊的安南境土，眞够火車跑了。從早晨六時就起身，不繼的直着，目的地還是那末在得遠遠的。</p>
<p>天氣是特别的熱，生長在温帶地方的我們，對於這氣候，是感覺得異常難過的；加以在河口嗅到的那股難的烟瘴氣味，又時時跟踪追着襲來，人不禁有幾分頭痛了。</p>
<p>同車的差不多盡是牙齒染得漆黑，嚼着一口鮮紅檳榔的安南人。在這些人中，有少數穿着短短的黑紗長衫，白布褲子，頭上</p>
<p>裹着一塊紗帕，脚上只套着一雙木頭鞋，並不着襪的貴族。除了這少數人之外，大都是穿着咖啡色的長衣，蓬首垢面，不大整潔的勞苦大衆了。</p>
<p>這些從鄕村裏出來的勞動者，帶着種種自已辛苦得的農産品，擠擠嚷嚷的坐在火車裏，大槪是販着東西到城市裏去賣吧？那末興奮的樣子，有的竟把脚踏在坐板上，唧唧喳喳的同伙栏交談着，火車裏顯得非常之熱鬧。</p>
<p>埋着頭，怪無聊的伏在車窗上，心不禁想起那遠在天邊的爸爸來了，我那年老無依的爸爸，他此時或者正揑着鋤頭在挖地……但他那裏想到此時，他的一個眼巴巴正望着來帮助他的兒子，會悄悄的遠離開他呢？而且，這是一文錢也没的出走…………</p>
<p>這末默默的在想着時，心裏不禁有些沉重了，但隨卽被未來的涉茫的希望鼓勵着，又有些釋然了。</p>
<p>天已經晚了，坐車的人不知在什麽時候，已下去了許多，車裏只剩下很少的幾個。黄昏帶來了凉爽的江風，在暮色蒼茫中，東京的那巍峨的建築物，已黑鬰鬰的望得見。四周瀰漫着炊烟似的暮靄，火車悠長地呌了兩聲，便轆轆地跑到耀着二十世紀文明的雄姿，長約八九里，横貫富良江和李仙江的那座鐵橋上去了。</p>
<p>這橋大約有四丈寛，鐵軌的兩旁，汽車可以駛過，橋上是滾滾奔流着的江水，江上浮着許多的木筏，映着東京的明亮的電燈光，這江上的風景，是格外的好看！</p>
<p>坐在火車上，過了這末一二十分鐘，才算把這橋通過。橋是直逹東京車站，火車過了富良江和李仙江，更由東京市的許多房子上經過，從窗外望下去，橋下的房子是那末低低的伏在車底下。…………</p>
<p>車到東京時，已是華燈初上的時候，馬路上兩旁的商店，羅列着耀人眼目的商品，光滑的柏油路上，汽車嗚嗚的呌着，如風馳電擲般的溜溜過去。這殖民地的新興都市，不用説；是和近代的其他大都市一樣的。</p>
<p>從車裏搬着行李，到了一家廣東人的開的店子裏，才把飯吃過，又怱怱的躍上車上去了。</p>
<p>這時，已是夜間九點多鐘，在這只有江風在呼呼的吹着的夜裏，懐着一顆惜别的心，便同東京分别了！</p>
<h3>論作品與生活的關係</h3>
<p>— 周毓英</p>
<p>最近接連有林焕平吳立平孟加三们先生接連討論作家的現實生活問題。林先生主張作家應該有［豐富］的［生活經騐］。吳先生則説［文學家决不是造成的，他不過是實際生活的人，作品也只是直接生活的經騐，他生活並不是爲着要産生偉大的作品。］孟先生是擁護前者而反對後者。對這問題我想説出幾點見，假使爭論不就此停止，也許好給大家作個參考。</p>
<p>第一，文學終究是以感情爲中心的一種學科，到了近代的進步的文學出現，這才加入思相的要素，於是感情和思想並重了。不過任憑把文學中的思想提高到如何程度，但文學中的感情與思想的發揮終究還要藉着［想像］。出想像構成文學的實體，而發揮出熱烈的感情－－通過某種思想的感情。文學的實體旣由想像來構成，想像只有深刻圓潤和浮淺惡劣的分别，决没有生活充實不充實的分别。荷馬的詩，托爾斯泰的小説，若要他們先嘗到作品中所描的生活然後再從事創作，這恐怕是不合理的要求吧。</p>
<p>第二，巴爾札克和高爾基的作品，也許有許多是他們［生活過來的實際生活的記錄］。但世界上像巴爾札克和高爾基那樣的窮苦流浪勞作的實際生活多得很，爲什麽只有巴爾札克和高爾基能够寫出作品來呢？又如中國的葉紹鈞芧盾張天翼等人，他們决不是絶對失敗的作家，難道他們的作品都應該是實際生活的記錄嗎同時巴爾札克和高爾基如發揮着高强的想像的藝術能力去描寫别種故事，好像辛克萊的描寫一個煤油大王的毁滅，描寫炭坑和屠塲的慘苦，這難道不比私生活的記錄有同樣價値嗎？</p>
<p>第三，文學是由藝術的想像所構成的實體，這想像的構成並不定要限於個人的實際生活的範圍，不過想像也不难離開了眞實的一般的生活。作家如抱着某種目的寫作品，自已的實際生活中又不曾有過那樣的經騐，遍得在亭子間裏大洋樓裏去想像社會的事情，想像力强的人本可寫出一點若有其事的作品來，想像力幼稚的便只能愚笨地説誑，作品完全失去眞實性。所以我相信作品的成功與否，完全是作家的能力問題，雖然难力弱的作家，描寫自已有經騐的故事比較容易成功，但這是作家的取巧而不能槪論文學的全體。</p>
<h3>從歷史到天文</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>近來天文學漸漸被注意起來，舊有的唯一的一本較完全的談天，常被人提起；國立編譯館編的天文學各詞，且在物理學名詞之先出現；恒星圖说也出現了；萬前文庫第二集裏預備收的關於天文的書有十幾本，此个别的書局也印了些物理的宇宙觀，神秘的宇宙，星空的巡禮等。</p>
<p>自己是也正在很高興讀天文書，自然引爲喜悦。過去爲找天文書看，曾感到一點痛苦，幾個可以去的圖書館裏，找不出幾本天文學書，想自已買，又老是没有錢，而且有些實在貴得可怕，譬如星空巡禮的原本，薄薄的九十幾頁，價格就是四元半。而且偶然有點餘錢，想買的書書店中不一定有，譬如天文年曆，自二十二年的中國天文年曆停印以後，就只好這年員本美國世界通書，那年買本日本天文年鑑。前幾天去買天文年鑑，新的還没有到，却在一家買航海用品店看到英國的節本航海通書，就隨便先買來看。</p>
<p>航海曆是講實用的，自然把一些可認爲不關緊要擱開不提，例如紀行星蹁度的部份，就史記金，火木土，星，而水，天，海就人不提。這使我記起某君所説天王星海王星與社會無關的意見。我是相信那意見的，雖然如果有一本專講天王星，海王星的書，我也很想讀，但那只是個人的偏嗜。</p>
<p>不過聲明的是，這偏嗜倒不是爲了想增加天文知識，對於這方面的偶然涉歷，還不曾使自已愚妄到以爲能專研究天王海王星。不過知道像羅惠爾用畢生之力研究火星，他雖然非常專門，寫出的書却頗足供人作詭奇的談助，而人人也頗樂於知道一點。到近兩年；引人注意的似乎是木星而不是火星了。依兩星相遇説者的意見，木星是太陽系形成的關鍵。太陽的歷史也許在森星外的行昨上記載着，那末，天王星海王星也許眞有一天變成一般人的普遍話題吧。</p>
<p>十年前拉勃垃斯的星雲説猶爲大家所信認，我也曾讀了從星雲到人類一本小册而彷佛若有所悟。右是現在這種溝通天文，地理的學説所藴藏的天文，地理間的矛盾，到底被發現了。星雲説所測得太陽生長的年齱，却不够地球生長，乃至不够地球上的生物生長。</p>
<p>近來的歷史學家，不再拘局於有語言文字以後的史實，而把年代放長，有的簡直從原生物講起。如果説這是歷史學的進步，這進步是要靠别棟科學的進步作基礎的。古代社會的研究，要人類學的研究先有眉目，人類學内就有許是地質學的問題，因地質學而引起整個地球的問題，而地球學又只是天文學的一分科。單就現在天文學還宵曾能决定地球的年齡這一點説，歷史年代的放長，是仍只能到某一限度，並且在這限度内，也不一定就絶無問題。</p>
<p>人類的每以人類爲重，固然是很自然的事，然就這層過去已給與進化論以很大的阴礙，到現在普通學校裏還不肯肯歷史的界限寛放。可是知道進化論對於歷史的重要的人，看見把歷史扯到天文，説不定也以爲悠謬。但我相信在從星雲到人類那個題目下，總會再另有新的好書出現。</p>
<h3>明天（十）（六）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Cornad）著吴向隅譯</p>
<p>她的包頭落在地上，他彎下腰去拾起來；她已不見了。他把它繞在他的手臂上，昂然走向窗口，他看見在圈椅中坐着一身體魁梧的胖子，一張没有的遮掩的燈，四周頭髮蓬鬆扁平的大面孔上面生着一張闊嘴，正在呵欠｜還看見貝珊小姐的頭及上半身。呌喊停止了，瞎子已逹到目的。他想到一切事都不如意，心中極爲紛亂。父親瘋了；不能走進屋去。没有錢回去，一個飢餓的留在倫敦伙伴也許要開始想到他已被他有意置之不理了。［作孽，］他喃喃説。自然他可以打開門進去；但他們也許爲了他没有問一聲，就要他綑縛得不能透氣｜｜這並不是一件多麽了不得的事，只不過他極怕被鎖起來，即是出於誤會。他想到這地方混身變冷，他在濕的草上用脚重踏着。</p>
<p>［你做什麽事的？｜｜一個水手麽？］一個激動的聲音説。</p>
<p>她已跑出來，也只是一團黑影，這黑影是被那她家窗上等待她的卤莽的黑影所吸引而來的［隨便什麽事。我的才能並不限於船上的一個水手。這次就是那樣來家的。］</p>
<p>［你從什麽地方回來的呢？］她問。</p>
<p>正在一個快樂的宴飲後，］他説，［乘倫敦的火車來｜｜曉得麽？晤？我很恨關閉在火車中。我對於一座房子倒不這樣難受。］</p>
<p>［啊］她説，［那還算幸運的。］</p>
<p>［因爲一座房子中，你還能在隨便什麽時候開開了那扇可惡的門，跑上横在你面前的路。］</p>
<p>［從此，就不回來了麽？　］</p>
<p>［至少十六年不回來，］他大笑。［到這兔圈中來，吃着一下倒楣的鍬……］</p>
<p>［一隻船也不見得怎麽大呀。］她譏刺地説。</p>
<p>［不，但海是大的呀。］</p>
<p>她垂下來了她的頭，像煞她的耳朶被那世界的聲音吸引得張開了一樣，她聽到在海堤以外的昨天的海風激起的流濤，拍着海岸，發出單調的嚴肅的振盪聲，似乎全地球都已變了一個喪鐘一般。</p>
<p>［哎，這就所謂一隻船是一隻船。你愛她你離開；一個海程不是一個結婚。］他這樣毫不在意地引用水手的諺語。</p>
<p>［那不是一個結婚，］她低語。</p>
<p>［你到這兒來是什麽目的呢？］她　制了恐懼地問。</p>
<p>［五金鎊，］他立即回答。［我們享樂得太過分一些，弄得有些困難了。］</p>
<p>［你一直是飲酒的麽？］她問。</p>
<p>［飤醉了三天；存心如此。我並不嗜酒｜你不要誤會。没有一件事，也没有一個人，能够制服我，除非我愛怎樣。我能够像一塊岩石一樣堅定。我的伙伴今早看到報紙，他對我説：［進行吧，哈利：愛你的父親。一定可以得到五金鎊］。因此我們搜刮各人的袋子凑成路費。可詛咒的戲弄。］</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>國聯理事的幽默</h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>天氣悶熱，獨坐亭子間中，十分無聊，身上覺得有些兒發癢，想着一個多月不去洗澡了，還是去洗個澡罷，便拿了换的衣服，走到附近一家澡堂子裏去洗澡，於是寛衣，解帶，洗澡擦背，出浴，揩身，一切的一切後，堂倌先生要好，又在我睡的前面，擺了一只矮矮的小凳，來替我揑脚，這時問我的開心快樂，眞是難以言語形容，［不知牛之夢爲胡蝶歟？胡蝶之夢爲牛歟？牛與胡蝶則必有分矣，］</p>
<p>於斯時也，抬起頭來看看天花板，或抽一根牙籤剔剔牙穢，或者看看指甲，兩個多月没有修，長到怎様地步，這時間的牛，眞是心廣體胖，一塵不染，無思無慮，其樂陶陶，假定這時有只照相機，把我這様的一付［牛頭馬］拍上一張照片，我想比［勞萊］［哈台］的面，當還要滑稽而幽默，</p>
<p>十日日内瓦電，國聯行政院今日午後重開會議時，羅馬尼亞外相蒂杜萊斯科發言，痛底匈國，［謂國聯前匈代表亞邦伊伯爵之逝世，彼等從未覺得若此之損失，伯爵恒根據於此，從事討讑，而匈國評讑家，今日則遭挑撥之無謂譴責，渠久寓英國與瑞士，試問兩國歷史，有容逋逃犯携帶軍械，及以軍械子彈與炸藥綀習事乎］，行政院諸理事，聞羅外之言，多侷促不安，意代表阿洛錫凝視天花板，法外長賴代亦從事剔牙，英掌璽大臣艾登，頻頻其指甲，我想這時國聯行政院幾位理事先生，到有些兒難過，因爲身任國聯行政院理事，而對於馬賽血案任問題，無法解决，現在聽到羅外相的一番議讑，只有啞口無言，故示鎭靜態度，眞有些兒尶尬，</p>
<p>國聯原是列强的一個分贓機關，對於弱小國間的糾紛，或者還有些兒辦法，還有權威來判斷，若一遇到强有力的國家出來搗亂，可以説絶對没有辦法，例如我國［九一八］之役，國聯幾次會議，我國代表侃而談，直陳正誼和公道，而國聯諸理事，到底無法罷佈，也只有看看天花板，剔剔牙穢，頻頻視指甲而已，此外還有什麽辦法呢？故國聯的［紙糊老虎］，早給日本人矗穿，還要去幹些什麽？語云，［不痴不聾，不作阿家翁］，這是國聯行政院諸理事所處的最好態度，這種態度，雖和我洗澡時間同，但是良心上的責備，總有些兒隱痛，總有些兒［難爲情］吧，倘然這時把諸理事的［照會］拍下來看看，一定有些兒味道，</p>
<h3>西貢岸</h3>
<p>— 李淡</p>
<p>輪船飄過了七洲洋，濃黑的海水，漸漸變成淡綠色了：靑山亦在糢糊隱約中出現。船裏面权到南洋求生的旅人們，他們的面前渺茫的跳動，已漸成較落實的歡躍了，大批没有嘗過［番客］的味道的新客，他們的心，更加搖幌着黄色的金夢呵。飄盪着新鮮的［番客］的大希望｜｜到番邦去做［番客］，賺錢！雖然番邦是有點迷茫而不可捉摸；但畢竟番邦是他們家鄕許多多富人的發祥地。所以他們多是生債賣子作舟資的，滿腔辛酸，猶是懷着驚喜而來。</p>
<p>船入港了，旅人們的心情更是活潑。沿港七十九個彎是那麽幽秀彎曲的，就像條長蛇，灣灣曲曲的爬進去，數不清的港灣一個復一個的過去。兩邊俱是靑綠的草萋萋。没有高天的大樹，只是浩曠一片濃綠。中間雜着些芧屋，没有像故國那様的高房子，那是越南土人的窮處所。和故國的風光，顯出是兩樣的情調了。</p>
<p>過完了七十九個灣，西貢岸上的海關商巍的建築物就站立在面前。到了番邦了！旅人們老早整好行李，等待離開厭倦的輪船，爬上目的地去嘗新味。但是熱烈的希望漸漸倦上來了。船靠岸許久，還没有動靜。岸上除了一些來接客的華僑之外，海關面前的法國人越南人就像若無其事的間走着。彷佛和船中焦急的客人是毫無關係的。</p>
<p>首先日本人自由的走上岸了，大模大樣的走入西貢市内去，並没有經過［新客衙］。其次，有錢的和街牌税的店主人，都事先有用錢討了人情，給他們的親友喜笑的接了去。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>剩一來的就是最大多數的困窮的人們了，他們不能預先用錢去討人情，所以就只好不安的在急等着。但是，時間儘是過去，還是没有響動，只有他們自已的不安和騷亂劇增。免不了焦燥不耐煩和担心的聲音四起：</p>
<p>［怎麽樣呀？］</p>
<p>［爲什還不上岸？］</p>
<p>然而，海關面前還是幽間的，没有法國人安南人走近船，他們眼巴巴的望着，終是落在空矌的地上，渺茫的徘徊着。船上孩子在哭，婦人們呢喃着。</p>
<p>等到法國人，進入新客衙辦公已經是太陽正烈的中午了。船上的旅人，已經等了半天。在猛烈的太陽光底下站，晒得昏糊了，脚酸手軟，仍是要耐心的等候着。這些客人，就给亡了國的安南人奉命的看守着，等着法國人辦那入口的手續。</p>
<p>近赤道的太陽光，比故國的熱了些。番邦的新味就先嘗到了這一點。等候到新客衙去，那是更多的麻煩了。船到西貢岸，他們已經失去了對於番客的羡慕，而不由不想着故鄕裏的家人。嘆着異邦不如故國！但是他們又看到日本人和有錢的中國人，又是另一番情狀。</p>
<h3>打更的，賣唱的，算命的</h3>
<p>— 峰</p>
<p>｜北平印象錄之四</p>
<p>古城像一個老人很早地便它歇了他累積着疲勞的身體。古城的夜是寂寞的，不像其他各都市通宵逹旦的熱鬧着；這寂寞來得很早。</p>
<p>在寂寞裏有三種人在寂寞地掙扎着：打更的，賣唱的，算命的。三種人用三種不同的聲音來表示他們的活動；一個是梆子，一個是三弦琴，又一個是簫。他們都具着一種凄然的音調。</p>
<p>八句鐘的時候，寂寞的小巷裏便可聽到那猛然的一聲響｜｜鐸，這是頭更，當你聽到那梆子很有節韵的五下五下那麽響，那是五更，早四五點的時候，天快亮了。任是風天雪夜，更夫們總是順着黑暗的胡同。拐過了條又一條，不時地注視着每一家的大門，如果是敞開着，他會唤起大門的主人：一喂，留神點兒，關上吧。然後又按着他們的步伐敲出那有節韵的鐸鐸之聲。那聲音是一種警告，但小的作夜活者聽到那聲音響近了時，會漸漸地屈伏着的。更夫們手中拿着一支竹竿，竹竿掛着鈎子。這竹竿引起我許多想像：黑色的墻頭上屈伏着胆小的賊人，誰家的門墻上靠着一架上梯子，或是靠墻的電桿上掛着一條黑色的褂子……讓他們手裏那半明减的燈光照出來了……。</p>
<p>那聲音又是一種安慰，在鐸的一下子裏有着抖擻的勇敢，像是睡覺着的人們的看守者。然而在不能安睡者的耳裏，那聲音便是魯莽的了，翻來覆去，正打算着不去計算時間的當兒，那聲音會鐸的一下子敲進你的心底去，告訴你那又是幾點了。</p>
<p>梆子聲還有點勇敢的氣息，三弦琴和簫便只有乞憐的音調了。這在凄然裏又似乎有些咽嗚。</p>
<p>彈三弦琴的多帶着靑年的姑娘，有時，這個人會是姑娘的家人。他們永彈着同一的調子，偶爾敲着大鼓，所謂大鼓，其實並不大，那是在預備唱的時候，放在姑娘面前，支在一個三角架子上來做姑娘唱的拍節的。他們的活動地域多是公寓和旅舍的附近，疲乏的客人或流浪者有時是有和一個女子對談的需要的。［伙計，呌打鼓的進來。］公寓有十五燭光電燈的房子裏，講着價錢，點着戲目，做着那無趣而必當的工作。完了</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>之後；［多給幾個酒錢吧，先生。彈琴的這樣央求着，然後走出公寓的門，在另］段街上彈出那同一的調子，依然是咽嗚的。</p>
<p>簫音，在咽嗚裏肯着更多的怨抑，像怨抑着命運的巔波吧？然而他們是算命的。算命的爲什麽多是瞎子呢？我不明白。他們拿着一支竹棍，在不平的地面是觸，他們該曉得地而的高低的，他們永不疑惑他們的着脚點，一步又一步地前走像命運註定了那樣的怨抑。他們在算着别人的命，知道那一個老頭那一年生，那一個姑娘那一年嫁；而他們似是並不算到自已的命的，他們只有怨抑着。</p>
<h3>怎様選擇雜誌和怎樣讀雜誌？</h3>
<p>— 章玉卿</p>
<p>因爲今年是雜誌年，甩以雜誌的名目會多至六百餘種，這様在整個文化的立塲上講起來，却是値得稱慶的一件喜事｜的確，它是打破了中國的例年來的畸形文化的怪現象。但是，患了知識飢餓荒的我們，該怎様的來選擇雜誌，和怎様讀雜誌？</p>
<p>果眞現代的書籍是太多了，而同時價格的昂貴，實非中産以下的所能買得起的｜而現代的生活又是十分的忙碌，在忙於生活的人，肆抽出一些時間來求知識，眞非易而做到的哪！第一要取最經濟的方法双我自已的經濟能力所能及者作原則；第二要取最切實的知識，以我自已所需要的知識爲目標，那末就只有雜誌了。</p>
<p>目觀近年來的雜誌的傾銷，書籍的停滯，大半的原因，當然是大多數人的購買能力薄弱之所致。雖然單行本並非本本都是壞。雜誌更非冊冊都是好，總之，先是中國的社會成了畸形，於是便有了這畸形文化怪現象的發生。</p>
<p>怎様選擇雜誌，怎樣讀雜誌？也許有很多的讀者都已明白了，或者也有些人眞待需要着有這樣的一個答案吧？不過。我很坦白地説：我非名流學者，現在我之所以寫這篇東西的動機，無非是把我自已讀雜誌的一些感慨來説一個大槪吧了。</p>
<p>第一在我們没有翻開雜誌將要讀雜誌的時候，應該先要認淸楚這冊雜誌是否我自已所需要的雜誌。原因是一本雜誌包招的内容比一本書來得複雜，而同時亦有專門性質的，那該又是怎末様呢？自然，首先我們該要在雜誌分類的常識了，但有，這分别却很不容易呢。我曾經見過有人這樣的説：［在那麽多的雜誌中眞使人一時分不出好歹呢！而且總難免那辦雜誌的人是有背景的，當然受了他人的金錢，總不能不替那出錢的人説幾句話吧？但是，很多的作家又是都用筆名，在初刊的時候眞容易上當，所以常常要在出過期之後才能看得出他們的底細，内容到底是説明了它的本身的，］因此，我們當一本雜誌在手的時候，應該先要辯别這本雜誌的内容。當然，站在純客觀立塲的雜誌和作家也不是完全没有的。</p>
<p>至於怎樣讀誌？然而讀雜誌的方法不外乎有四種：（一）全讀：就是把一本雜誌完全讀完，無讑自已需要不需要的都讀它一遍，明瞭整本雜誌的内容。（二）選讀：把自已心愛的東西，或是切實需要的文章，儘可選着來讀。（三）快讀：比全讀可以馬虎些，比台像有趣味的小品文以及小説等，以明白全篇的大槪。（四）細讀：每篇的文章都該仔仔細細地讀，就好像批評家似的態度，用冷靜的頭腦和判斷的目力，來衡量雜誌的内容，但切不可參加自已主觀的見解，該站在純客觀的地位。</p>
<h3>日光浴</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>孤獨</h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>冷的風，括着那寂靜的路面，枯黄的落葉在那地上打滾，他踏着缓步的在徘徊，他心裏感到寂寞而又感到沉悶，他想在，在想着那结過去知現在，將來呢？他只有望着那闇黑的天，和那寂靜的馬路，感到了茫茫，［永遠是這樣了吧？］他時時這樣的自問着，可是誰能給他一個回答呢？只有風，緊括着路面的風，在他的耳邊響着，似乎是説：［你的前途，就好似你現在跑在這馬路上。］</p>
<p>夜的黑手緊摸在都市的頭上，黑暗佔有了他眼前的世界，他呆望着，遙遠地注視着那熱鬧街市的燈光，他憎惡牠，痛恨牠，一切在他都感到悲哀，明白這憎惡，這痛恨都是多餘的，都是一個孤獨的人，所不應該有的念頭。他明白大幾年前，當在他過着快樂的生活的時期，他見了那些，那些現在擺現在他的探野中的事物是可愛的，是如何瘋狂的去追求牠。可是人的心理是自私的不足的，當他有着那樣歡樂的環境，他是絶不想到那些和他現在處在相同的境地的人們。然而現在，變了，環境變了，他的感覺也變了，他只有感到自已的悲哀和孤獨，一個人，如他，就是這樣的自私着。</p>
<p>［没落了吧！我就是這樣的孤獨，小資産階級的末路的悲哀呀！］</p>
<p>他閉上了疲倦的眼眶，抖身上的舊秋衣，躺落在那冷冰的床上，沉入了回憶的夢海中。</p>
<p>他想着，他夢着，他憶起承島市上的一個冬天的晚上。</p>
<p>島市的冬是可愛的，是温瞹的，是美麗的。那是一個睛朗的午後，他拉着蘋的手，缓步在海濱，沐浴在太陽的光輝裏，聽着那海潮的低微地嘯聲。海灘上的淺沙，一望的白色，沿着港灣的曲綫，他和她在缓步着。</p>
<p>［再走吧！這是你最後的看到這島市的景色了。去過希望着，我意有一天會離開了這裏，去過一個冬，那嚴寒的冬，同時也和着你。］</p>
<p>他似乎是醉了，他一點也没有感覺到，他該怎樣回答她，該怎樣的向她説些安慰的話，他只是望着那在他脚下，他感到苦悶和寂寞，他第一次的感覺到這樣的心境。</p>
<p>太陽在那茫茫的深藍色的水邊跳躍，似乎在告訴人們；［天已經是快晚了，快樂的人們喲！離開了這裏吧！都市的夜，是在等待着你們去享樂了，那裏有的都是你們的世界，别醉了吧！快樂的人們。］</p>
<p>冰冷的風，刺進她的軀體，他明白，他驚醒，他知道那是過去的往事了。他睜開了兩眼，望着黑洞洞地房子裏，在他眼前，一切都糢糊，都寂靜着，他伸起了腰，探望着那窗外，擺現在恨前的，又是那都市的繁盛的夜，光明的夜，快樂者的夜，令人陶醉的夜。</p>
<p>孤獨，孤獨，他只更加的感受到了人生的孤獨，他又低聲的念着！</p>
<p>［没有了吧！我就是這樣的孤獨，小資産階級的末路的悲哀呀！］</p>

<h3>美車重入歐洲市塲</h3>
<p>— 雪萊</p>
<p>｜半年來出口增進一倍｜</p>
<p>在已往的二二年中，歐洲因爲鬧着不景氣，各種工業都受極大的打擊，社會經濟的衰落，工人的失業更是不一而足，政府爲補救於萬一起見，對於外貨的侵入，都抱着嚴厲的態度，不是高築關税壁壘，便是加重税收，像椯法意德等國，對付國外汽車的輪入多用這種方法去抵制，一方面可以限制金錢的流出，一方面救濟國骨的失業工人，爲各國明身經濟關係着想，當然也是未强厚非的，這種情形，一直到今年春天，似乎稍有轉變，因爲歐洲的經濟狀况，略現好轉，各業也隨之而有起色，嗣後情形一天姨過一天，直至最近，歐洲的汽車市塲便大有轉機了，而其中尤以美國汽車的地们日見隆增，本來是銷路滯呆的，現在很覺活動，本來人家無力購置的，現在多躍躍欲試，並且已經有許多的美國太型汽車在歐洲暢銷，預料將來的情形，還有蒸蒸日上之勢。</p>
<p>歐洲製造汽車的國家，以英法意三國爲最發逹，英國因爲機械業發逹，屬地的輸出較殷，所以他的汽車工業，尤在法蘭西和意大利之上，在近年在，英國得獲各國减買美車的機會，便竭力的奮鬭着，想在歐洲得到更佔優勢的汽車市塲，本來這個機會是很好的，而且已經略有成效了，可惜目下情勢變動，原有熱望，未免成爲泡影，因爲事實上，最近美國汽車在歐洲不但恢復了已經失去的市塲，並且還有增進的可能，在同時英國的歐洲汽車市塲却受了一個重大打擊，這一點不能不呌英國汽車製造商担心的，加以最近的三四個月中，英國本身的汽車市塲中，給美國車子侵入，其他領屬各地，美車也大見傾銷，本來這一部份貿易可算得是英人私有的，現在也給美人攫去了，怎不更令英國的車商搯着一把汗呢？</p>
<p>據英國汽車製造商人的統計。一九三四年開首的六個月中。美合衆國出口到歐洲的汽車數。除不列顚之外。計共二七·０００輛。至於英國所造的汽車。輸出至歐洲各國的。那末祇不過五千六百四十三輛。英車出口總數中。包括輸往愛爾蘭自由邦的一千三百六十五輛。這個市塲。對於英國汽車的出路是極有利益的。至於美國汽車呢。差不多完全不能輸入愛爾蘭了。這個原因。説起來是很容易明白的。因爲愛爾蘭自由邦政府現在禁止整個的外國汽車輸入。由此可知美車不但目前無從踏進愛邦。就是將來的情况。一時也難以推斷哩。所以在今年的開始六個月中。美合衆國雖然有三０·０００輛的整部汽車輸入歐洲各國。可是到愛爾蘭去的。不過一百九十八輛。拿全數比較起來。還不及百分之一哩。</p>
<p>一九三四年一月到六月中的半年裏。美國汽車在歐洲市塲中。最暢銷的一國是比利時。雖然比國對於外國汽車的進口税。徵取甚高。可是在這六個月中。他向美國購了九千七百五十一輛汽車。瑞典的汽車塲。近年來向爲英國汽車製造商所注意的。半年中購進美車五千四百六十三輛。他向大不列顚所買的代步品。祇有四百三十三輛。兩相比較大爲懸殊。講到英國自已。他是歐洲各國購買美車的第三個好主顧。在今年開始的六個月。美車英的共計三千七百五十九輛。此外。美國汽車輸入丹麥的計三千三百六十二輛。荷蘭二千六百三十八輛。英國汽車進口的祇有三百二十八輛。美車輸入瑞士的一千五百八十輛。英車不過一百四十一輛。</p>
<p>若然拿全世界來購。美國汽車輸往全球各國的。一九三四年的開首六個中。較之一九三三年的同時期。增加逹一倍有奇。一九三四年六月底止。美國在倍有奇。一九三四年六底止。美國在海外所售出的私用汽車計逹七八·六三六輛。一九三三年同時期爲三三·三八六輛。加上歐洲各國所購的三０·０００輛。其中二八·三一六輛爲英國各地所購進。</p>
<p>不列顚自身之汽車工業。目下亦有相當之發逹。不過在已往之若干時期中。美國汽車輸入英國的非常的微細。這裏是有兩個原因。一個便是馬力税的實行。於是大汽車的銷塲就大見低落。其次是關税壁壘。外車未免受打擊。此外像社會經濟的不佳。失業人數的增加。都在密切關係。所以美車在英的銷塲。可説是涓滴而已。至於具呢。情勢轉换。美國汽車進口至不的。今年較去年增加了五倍之多。據公家的統計根本。本年一月一日至九月三十日止。美車在英共銷五千二百三十四輛。去年同時期的九個月中爲一千四百三十輛。英國又向其所屬領各地輸入汽車二千二百四十輛。這種汽車的原製造者就是美國。不過想從徵百分之三十三又三分之一的税。减至百分之二十五起見。所以裝到坎拿大去裝配轉運到英國去。向來英國對於外國所造的汽車輸入。都收税百分之三十三又三之一。而從坎拿大去的呢。可獲有特殊的優益。所以這種汽車在表面上看起來，好像是從坎拿大出口的，實際上確是美國出産的轉口貨哩。坎拿大所購法蘭西汽茲一百七十一輛。世界其餘各國的汽車計一百十三輛。</p>
<h3>一九三五年式奥斯汀新車</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>｜業已到滬｜</p>
<p>嘗考奥斯汀汽車分司。對於新車之榸構製。實自有其確定不移之方針。而非盲從附和。徒以變更花樣爲能事者可比。惟其然也。該公司旣經殫思竭慮。悉心研討。製成一種確實可靠之車輛後。卽不復輕舉妄動。貿然變更。以冀炫奇立異。每一年中。縱或稍有改變之處。亦皆以適應公衆需要爲主。奥斯汀之價値與可靠。所以永享盛名於世者。此種政策，蓋卽其重大原因之一也。茲者一九三五年式奥斯汀新車。業已到申。爰特以其槪况。略述如次。以餉讀者。</p>
<p>奥斯汀廠方之意。以爲本年所需要者。乃更較寛敞之車身。而非機械方面之重大變更。故目下旣無所謂流綫轎車。亦無所謂獨立懸置，按以流綫轎車而論。奥斯汀爵士。曾表示其意見曰。此種型態車身所裝配之斜坡狀屏風。適足以阴礙駕駛人之視綫耳。若奥斯汀新車。則無引種缺憾。新車所稍加變更者。乃車身綫度較長。姿態彌極曼妙而自然。至於最新設計之水箱殻。與長形發動機罩。則使其全部形式。極美妙壯觀之至。各項設備。較前尢爲整齋劃一。且皆鑲嵌於車身。因斯全部觀瞻。倍覺整潔雅緻。毫無累贅之象。到以底盤而言。則一九三五年式奥斯汀新車機械工程方面之主要改進。厥爲第二擋排。與第三擋及末擋。完全採用諧式是也。按此種改革。奥斯汀爵士某次演説。曾謂廠方認爲無足重輕。原非必要。祇以公衆人士。旣皆愛好此項裝置。爰特裝配於新車。以適合计會人士之需要。至於海斯齒輪盒。於上次展覧時卽已博得一般人之讚賞。公認爲奥斯汀僅有之特色。惟以出産方面種種因難。致未充分應用。今則産量大增。十六及十八匹馬力式。並皆可裝配之。按奥斯汀新車。雖具有上述種種改進。但所售價格。大致與前相同。無甚變更。而其中尤以七馬力式爲最足稱。蓋在價格方面。旣具有相當减抑。而在品質方面。則其種種改良。與偉大進步。尤非同類車輛所可同日而語。其底盤特别低落。底板髙度。較前减低五寸之多。車身後部。地位寛敞。倍蓰於前。兩前座均可朝前摺疊。以便上下。並極便於分别梭正其位置。以享受極度安適。兩車門胥極寛闊。窗框細狹異常。駕駛人置身座上。舉目四曯。一覧無餘。車身備輪罩。及行李夾。均係密藏於内。毫無妨於觀瞻。</p>
<p>此外種種變更。計有嵌置之方面指示器。苟便轉向輪管轄器。加大輪胎。蓄電池藏置發動機罩下。以及特優推進軸等。其管理之便易。與操縱之得心應手。殊足使駕駛之者。驚喜不置。至凡爲經濟着想。欲以最低廉代價享受乘車樂趣者。則有奥波爾雙座式。在其國内。零售價格僅一百鎊。裝配舊式水箱。外觀式樣。與去歳岀品同。</p>
<p>按上述種種進步與變更。不僅小奥斯汀爲然。卽較大汽車。亦復如此。一馬力四缸式。輸出數額已逾五萬輛。其新增設備。計有均衡電壓表。雙屏風刷。新式車頭燈。及節熱保冷裝置。轎式車身。較前更加寛闊宏敞。輕便十二匹式。或用十二·九匹馬力之四缸引擎。或用十三·九或十五·九匹馬力之六缸引擎。均無不可。如須較大底盤。則有十六匹及十八匹馬力式。台約克轎車。乃最新增加之一種式樣。凡此諸種式樣。均可添設臨時座。故儘可儎客七人。無虞侷促。况後座極便梭正。故尤易於支配。再此諸車。如須裝配海斯齒輪盒。均可照辦。至於十二匹四缸式。亦已裝配諧動二擋排。但各項管理裝置。則悉仍其舊。未經變更。最後尚須述及者。卽二十匹馬力式。斯爲富麗矞皇之大汽車。除具在其餘各式奥斯汀新車之一切最新進步餐。且更具有堅强卓絶之低落式Ｘ横擋車架。與新式轉向機。</p>
<p>關於海外推销。奥斯汀新車。且更具有特色多種。如各種式樣。除十二匹四缸，及二十匹式外。統可裝配左手轉向盤，及管理裝置。特别地面距隙。特殊懸置。及輪胎。以及三層堅厚玻璃等。凡此蓋皆其特色之犖犖大者。</p>

<h3>記［車輪之前進］</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>利喴汽車公司於九日假座卡爾登大戲院放映英國奥斯汀汽車製造廠攝製之業務宜傳影片［車輪之前進，］事前揭示於報端，歡迎各界人士前往參觀，是日適爲星期例假，晨十時，參觀人士，已踵趾相接，樓上下均告客滿，甚有扶老携糼，關第光臨者，其盛况實爲前此所未有，愚至該院，承招待者設法覓得一座，其餘因無坐而傍立，以及無處可立则退出者，尚有數百人，號召力亦云偉矣。</p>
<p>十時半放映，第一幕背景爲一家庭，父方傍爐而坐，子則據案習書，詢其父昔年之交通情形，由其父之演述中，乃映出今昔交通不同之對照，初爲一馬車，車内乘客甚擠，疾馳有頃，備受顚簸之苦，繼則映最初發明之汽車，又映近代之汽車，有私人乘坐者，有公共乘坐之雙層式者，其中富麗舒適，不可與昔同日而語，嗣又映邮最初之火車，乘客所坐之客車，無蓬無窗，僅如一運石碴之邊車，内中乘客甚多，皆蹲伏車内，下車時用木製之短梯，扶携乃得下，以視今日乘客可以在車内閲書報，用西餐者，不啻霄壤。</p>
<p>新舊交通工具比照之後。於映奥斯汀廠之内部工作狀况，凡車身，車輪，引擎，等，雖細微至於一鋼桿，一曲棍，皆詳細顯出其製造經過極詳，車成後，繼以髹漆，裝箱而出口，無不畢呈於目前，卽吾人親歷該廠參觀，其眞切亦不過如是，該廠佔地九十三畝，工人一萬六千人，監工六百人，偉大爲歐洲之冠，尤堪注意者，卽油漆部分，悉用女工，工作時以車身作鏡，頻頻自理其髮，殊足顯其車身光亮之之斑。</p>
<p>廠内各部映完，復映該廠出品之爬山之奇蹟，山爲挪威之高峯，滿山皆雪，爬行極爲困難，而該車卒得逹其絶巓，其機力之優良，可以槪見。</p>
<p>嗣則又一甜蜜之家庭，夫婦偕子女二人乘奥斯汀車作郊外之遊，入一森林中，備享大自然之樂，又有驅車偕侶入海濱游泳者，意皆自得，總之，凡此種種，皆顯露汽車對於人民之需要，而有置備之必要也。</p>
<p>最後爲英國著名之風景片，山水淸明，令人悠然神往，幾如身歷其境，查廣告式之宣傳影片，最難引起觀衆之興味，蓋其取材既狹，又復枯澀之味，獨此片以新穎之故事叙述，佐以優美之風景攝影，而以業務宣傳，置之於不知不覺之間，是誠堪爲各汽車廠商所借鏡也，因就所憶者記之。</p>

<h3>The Division of the Hebei-Peiping Boundary is Not Easy to Resolve Temporarily</h3>
<p>(Peiping) On the issue of the Hebei-Peiping boundary division, the opinions of both sides have not yet been unified.

<h3>The Committee for the Preservation of Antiquities Requests the Opening of Yi's Case for Trial</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee for the Preservation of Antiquities studied the case of Yi Peiji's antiquities. In addition to submitting another case for instructions on the part of Ma Sai's private transport of antiquities, the evidence and number of Yi's theft were truthfully reported first, and the case was submitted to the National Government, ordering the judicial organs to promptly judge it according to law. The original report is extremely long, with three paragraphs of suspected theft and replacement, but it is not stated that the above three facts show that the president of the court is suspected of seriously stealing and replacing the palace jade. After checking, this case has been reported in newspapers, spread all over China and foreign countries, and people all over the country have severely criticized it. After the court's investigation, it has been completed for a long time and is quite troublesome. The materials obtained are sufficient to be based on, and a public prosecution has been filed. If the president of the court has no theft or replacement, he should stand up and present a defense. He has nothing to fear from the national laws, and even more so to use the concession, use his political position, and repeatedly resist appearing in court, which shows that the president of the court Yi Peiji and others have obviously apparent malpractices and cannot be denied. Since this case has been filed for public prosecution by the court, it seems that there is no need for this committee to re-investigate it. It is proposed to ask your hospital to submit it to the National Government, ordering the Judicial Yuan to handle it quickly to dispel the doubts of the people, and the dignity of the law is related to the national prestige. Judicial officials should be those who enforce national laws, and the country should be responsible for giving them full authority and guaranteeing their safety with national power, so that they can fully exercise their powers from beginning to end and make a swift judgment in accordance with the law, so as to maintain the spirit of the rule of law and judicial independence of the country. In addition to submitting another case for instructions on the part of the smuggling of antiquities in Marseille, I respectfully submit to your hospital for review and implementation the circumstances of this committee's handling of the case of the theft and replacement of jewelry in the Forbidden City. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Central Committee for the Preservation of Antiquities sent Huang Wenbi and Teng Gu to Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to inspect the current state of antiquities in various places.

<h3>Chiang Agreed to Allocate Funds to Assist in Eradicating Opium in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned Beijing Mayor Shi Ying on the 13th to inquire about the anti-opium movement in the capital, and said that the establishment of a temporary drug rehabilitation hospital requires funds, and he was deeply worried that the municipal treasury would be exhausted and unable to bear the burden. He agreed to allocate 50,000 yuan from the Military Supplies Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs to Mayor Shi in two monthly installments to assist. In addition, Chiang is extremely concerned about municipal construction. After returning to Beijing this time, he repeatedly telegraphed and summoned Mayor Shi to meet and talk, and wrote letters to Mayor Shi twice to instruct him on everything. He paid special attention to rectifying the city appearance, promoting national loans, improving customs, banning strange costumes, promoting the New Life Movement, and eradicating opium, and the instructions were extremely detailed. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing Municipal Government ordered its public officials and teachers to confess to their superiors within three days if they were smoking opium or taking highly toxic drugs, and they would still be allowed to stay in their positions for compulsory rehabilitation. Those who are found after the deadline will be sent to court for heavier punishment in addition to being dismissed from their duties. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to those in charge of the anti-opium association and the Ministry of Health, the rumors that the deadline for drug rehabilitation is three months or six months are all inaccurate. The anti-opium association advocates that everyone should quit at once in a shorter time, and even for those who are deeply addicted, it does not take such a long time to quit. However, how to regulate it is still to be determined at the second standing committee meeting, based on the medical treatment and accommodation conditions. The second standing committee meeting will be held after the Fifth Plenary Session closes. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

He visited Chiang and Wang in Beijing several times, and the central government was extremely satisfied with everything in Qingdao. There is no problem with issuing public bonds.

<h3>British to Protest Japanese Oil Control Again</h3>
<p>(London) The British government has repeatedly negotiated regarding Japan's oil control law and is now planning to lodge another protest with the Tokyo government, although the date has not yet been confirmed. According to the control measures set by Japan, foreign companies wishing to sell oil in Japan must establish storage tanks and store enough oil to last for six months based on the previous year's sales. The Japanese government also reserves the right to set oil prices and has the right to requisition all stored oil for public use at any time, paying compensation at the price set at that time.

<p>Warsaw Polish markets have recently discovered Japanese goods, such as a batch of Japanese thermometers selling for only three Zlotys per dozen (Polish currency name). Someone in Lodz is also promoting Japanese raw silk. Currently, the amount of trade between Poland and Japan is very small. In the first ten months of this year, Poland's exports to Japan totaled 1.2 million Zlotys, while Japan's exports to Poland were only 900,000 Zlotys. However, according to news obtained in Warsaw, Japanese loans will be vigorously promoted in the Polish market. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

It is now learned that the Exchange has formed a subcommittee composed of one director and three brokers to study this issue. No decisions have been made yet, but it is known that the committee has found a place to store silver bars, and some say that operations can definitely begin in February next year. However, most people believe that it will take longer to handle all matters, and it may not be possible to open in February. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary: The Sino-Vietnamese Trade Treaty Should Be Revived Urgently. Ting</h3>
<p>French Minister Wei Lidung arrived in Beijing from the plains yesterday, and there are reports that he will continue to discuss the Sino-French Vietnamese trade treaty with our country's diplomatic authorities. According to the Sino-French Vietnamese border trade regulations signed during the thirteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1887), it expired in August of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. Since then, there have been repeated negotiations with the French side to renew the new treaty, but the French side has been using excuses to delay it. It was not until May of the nineteenth year that the "Sino-French Special Agreement on Relations between Vietnam and the Border Provinces of China" was finally concluded. After the treaty was concluded, our country immediately approved it. However, the French side, after signing it, raised objections again. The content of the treaty was generally beneficial to our country, so the French argued that the pending issues between China and Vietnam had yet to be resolved and that the tariff schedule for goods traveling between China and Vietnam had not yet been finalized as excuses for refusing to approve it quickly. After our country levied import duties on foreign rice, the French side further argued that Vietnamese rice exports to China were greatly affected and that tariff rates must be reduced as a condition for exchange, which our country did not allow. As a result, even though there was a new treaty, it could not be implemented.</p>
<p>The previous Sino-Vietnamese trade regulations originally stipulated that Chinese goods entering Vietnam would enjoy special preferential tariffs. The old regulations expired in the fifteenth year. Since July of the eighteenth year, the Vietnamese government has cancelled the special tariff for Chinese goods and applied the highest new tariff for non-treaty countries to Chinese goods. According to a report from overseas Chinese merchants in Vietnam in August of this year, the local tax rate on Chinese goods has increased by ten to several times. As a result, bulk Chinese goods transported to Vietnam, such as silk fabrics, Gu embroidery, porcelain firecrackers, etc., have almost completely disappeared. Chinese overseas industry and commerce are on the verge of bankruptcy. The general overseas Chinese have no treaty protection and are subject to economic oppression. Those who are deported for failing to return to their home country or for being unable to pay their personal taxes account for almost half of the total number. Even those who are lucky enough to survive are overwhelmed by various harsh regulations and have no choice but to endure them. If we do not quickly negotiate with the French side to approve the new treaty today, it will make it impossible for all overseas Chinese to gain a foothold. This is what we cannot help but hope that our foreign authorities can decisively resolve.</p>
<h3>Naval Negotiations Ultimately Fail After a Month of Stalemate in London</h3>
<p>British Cabinet Decides on Indefinite Suspension</p>
<p>Quietly Awaiting Japanese Government's Announcement of Treaty Abandonment</p>
<p>(London) The British government held a cabinet meeting on the morning of the 12th to discuss countermeasures for the naval preparatory conference and decided: (1) Suspend the preparatory conference before Japan announces the abandonment of the Washington Treaty; (2) Reopen the preparatory conference in March or April next year. The United States seems to have no objection to this proposal. If Japan agrees, the suspension can be realized. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) British Representative Councilor Craig visited the US and Japanese representatives at noon on the 12th based on the decision of the government cabinet, proposing a temporary suspension of the preparatory conference and requesting their consent. Japanese Representative Matsudaira immediately telegraphed his home government for instructions. The US representative had no objection. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The delegations from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan will hold a three-nation plenary meeting on the 13th or 14th because the preliminary talks are about to be suspended. It is reported that Representative Yamamoto plans to return home within the year to report on various matters to the government. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, commented on the failure of the naval talks, emphasizing the necessity of cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States, and stated in brief, "If the naval talks fail, and we still expect the success of the official naval conference, it is tantamount to wishful thinking. Although this is an unpleasant matter, the fact is so, and we must plan for a response. Japan has already destroyed the naval restrictions created by the Washington and London Treaties and the Pacific security system. Now that things have come to this, there is no need to panic, and it is even more inappropriate to waste financial resources and greatly expand the navy on this pretext. For the present plan, the United Kingdom and the United States should maintain the closest cooperation, remain calm and composed, and jointly respond." (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>MacDonald and Davis Hold a Long Private Meeting</h3>
<p>Progress in British-American Relations</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald held a private meeting with US Representative Davis this morning for 45 minutes. Later, it was heard that the date for reopening the naval talks has not been determined. Although Japan wants to convene a talk again, this may not happen. Preparations for the 1935 naval conference will be handled by the diplomatic side. Both the United Kingdom and the United States believe that a new development is necessary to make it worthwhile to reopen the naval talks before a new talk can be convened. A spokesman for the British delegation told a Reuters interviewer today that the naval talks were quite beneficial because they increased relations between the United Kingdom and the United States. Obstacles have now been cleared, and public opinion has crystallized, and the way forward is now certain. Everyone feels that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan each have their own definite naval policies, which they will use to prepare for the naval conference. Davis is not disappointed that the talks have not achieved any concrete results. He feels that the hard work of the representatives has created a good result of clearing the air and establishing a stable and certain ideology. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry and Navy Department Confer on Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Abandonment of Treaty Announced on the 22nd</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has not received the official announcement of the suspension of the naval conference, but Ambassador Matsudaira has sent a telegram to the Foreign Ministry reporting the matter. The Foreign Ministry is currently discussing countermeasures with the Navy Department. Japan does not welcome the suspension of the naval conference and hopes to separate the issue of abolishing the Washington Treaty from the naval conference and continue the talks. However, because there was no result from requesting to continue the talks, it agreed to the suspension. Therefore, the Japanese government's policy is to agree on the condition that preparatory talks be reopened next year and has issued a recall telegram to Representative Yamamoto. (Jiji News Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Privy Council has confirmed that it can decide on the abandonment of the Washington Treaty on the 19th. After the government officially decides at a cabinet meeting on the 19th or 20th, the abandonment of the treaty will be announced on the 22nd. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Washington Prepares to Speed Up Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>Naval Aircraft Squadron Flies to Fiji</p>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials did not express surprise today when they received news from London that the naval talks would end on the 15th of this month. According to the opinion of the Navy, a decision will be made to accelerate the shipbuilding process after knowing the final result of the naval talks. Secretary of the Navy Swanson said today that he can begin building sufficient warships within the next two years so that the US Navy can reach the strength allowed by the treaty in 1939. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>San Francisco According to reliable news from the New Mexico flagship, the US Navy is currently planning a squadron flight during the naval exercises next spring. The destination of this squadron flight is the Philippine Islands. It is speculated that the details of the plan have not yet been finalized. Whether to take the route through Honolulu and the southern air route, or the route through Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Japan, and China, the Navy has not yet decided. If the northern route is followed, there will be more places to land in the event of an accident, but the climate along the way is changeable and often foggy, so it is better to take the Hawaii route. Secretary of the Navy Swanson said that long-distance flights must be held during the naval exercises next spring, but he said that where to fly has not yet been decided. Secretary Swanson did not directly indicate whether to fly to the Philippines. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>We believe that diplomatic negotiations are not easy, and the difficulty of making a treaty is even greater. However, both parties to a treaty should have their minimum expectations. When these expectations are met, they should be considered quite satisfactory. In our country's position in signing a Sino-Vietnamese treaty, protecting overseas Chinese should be the top priority. If this point can be achieved, everything else can be accommodated. If the French minister still requests a reduction in the import tax on foreign rice, we may wish to give sympathetic consideration to it. Taxes on foreign imports should be changed at any time. When there is a need for foreign rice domestically, the tax rate should be reduced. When foreign rice prices are extremely high, the tax rate should be increased, or even imports should be prohibited. Adapting to the times is not immutable. Moreover, the import tax on foreign rice is lower in Guangdong. Some rice merchants order rough rice from Saigon, Vietnam, transport it to Guangzhou, whiten it, and then transfer it to Shanghai for sale, thereby evading taxes. It can be seen that levying taxes is difficult to fully implement. Moreover, more than half of the actual power of rice exported from Saigon is in the hands of overseas Chinese. Reducing the import tax on Saigon rice is also beneficial to the local overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>In addition, our authorities can tell the French minister: (1) China's trade with Vietnam is often in a deficit. In the first four months of this year alone, the deficit in Vietnamese goods reached 14.46 million yuan. For the benefit of France, we should take into account the friendship of our China and quickly approve the previously concluded treaty. (2) According to the new Sino-French tariff treaty of January 18, the people of the two contracting countries enjoy equal treatment with respect to tariffs, internal taxes, or any taxes in each other's territory. At the same time, it was also declared that this treatment includes territories, colonies, and protectorates. Therefore, with this tariff treaty, even without the new treaty of the 19th year, there should be no discrimination against Chinese goods.</p>
<h3>US Representatives to Spend Christmas in England</h3>
<p>Return Trip Postponed</p>
<p>(London) It is now learned that the US representatives participating in the three-nation naval talks will not be leaving for home on Saturday as expected but will be spending Christmas in England. The talks will be extended to the 20th of this month, at which time all the representatives, including British Prime Minister MacDonald, will leave London for other destinations to spend their holidays. It is said that the reason for the postponement of the US representatives' itinerary is that instructions from Tokyo to the Japanese representatives have been delayed. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) According to confirmed news, the US representatives, including Davis, who participated in the preliminary naval negotiations, will return home on the Manhattan and Washington ships. The two ships are scheduled to depart on December 15 and December 29, respectively. After learning that the British government had decided to suspend negotiations indefinitely before Japan officially announced the abandonment of the Washington Treaty, the US delegation held a meeting on Wednesday afternoon to decide on future policies. The US delegation has now left the matter of reopening negotiations to the decision of British Prime Minister MacDonald, but only if Japan proposes new suggestions as a condition for reopening the meeting.

<h3>Singapore Spy Case: Nishimura Commits Seppuku; Autopsy Performed</h3>
<p>Police Announce Details of the Case</p>
<p>Singapore The sudden death of Nishimura, manager of Ishihara Sangyo Co. and president of the Singapore Japanese Association, in the local police station last Saturday has caused a "spy panic" and shocked the world. Today, the remains were examined in court as usual, without a jury. The government pathologist claimed to have found crystals of strychnos nux-vomica in Nishimura's abdomen, which was the cause of his death. At the time, a small crowd was watching the examination, mostly Japanese. After the pathologist left the witness stand, the police stated that on the evening of December 4, a Japanese man named Kashima was found in a park outside Singapore. When asked to show his passport, he replied that it was at Nishimura's place. Nishimura was then summoned to the station that night. Nishimura handed over the passport, proving that Kashima was his employee, and took out a ship ticket to prove that Kashima would be leaving the next day. The next day, Nishimura returned to the police station to provide information that the police wanted to know. Nishimura confessed everything to the Chief Inspector of the Asian Division of the Special Branch of the police station. When the Japanese translator of the police station entered the room, he said a few words to Nishimura, the nature of which is unknown. Nishimura suddenly fell to the ground and fainted. Four doctors rushed to the scene within 20 minutes, but he still died. Later, a Japanese doctor stated that Nishimura was in good health and had not taken any medicine containing strychnos. Another Japanese doctor testified that he had made a phone appointment with Nishimura on the morning of December 5 to talk at the Japanese Club at 8 pm, as the deceased was the president of the club. Nishimura agreed to the appointment. Nishimura's wife, who is young and</p>
<p>short, spoke Japanese very calmly. According to her testimony, her husband returned home for lunch at noon on December 5, as he always did at this time. After lunch, he went to the bathroom and then went out at 2 pm. Rubber broker Fukuda testified that on December 5, Nishimura strongly urged him to participate in the Japanese Association meeting that night because he had previously opposed attending. Nishimura planned to go to the meeting later and then separated to go to the police station. The examination then ended. The coroner announced that the verdict would be announced on December 15.

<p>Taking Offensive Action Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Singapore Eighteen destroyers and the aircraft carrier Eagle, carrying 24 aircraft, and the cruiser Cambellton are scheduled to leave here tonight for somewhere in the Chinese Sea to launch an attack on Singapore. The two armies will likely make contact on Saturday or Sunday afternoon. At that time, four scout airships and 24 bombers will fly to the sea to search for the invading fleet and attack them with bombs. However, no matter what happens at sea, the defending army will allow the fleet to approach the coast and attempt to land troops, and then 4,000 regular and volunteer soldiers from Singapore will meet them. The victory or defeat of the attacking air force will depend on whether their visibility is clear. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>San Diego Spy Case: Japanese Villager Released</h3>
<p>Sketches in His Pocket Arouse Suspicion</p>
<p>Why Loitering Near the Fortress?</p>
<p>San Diego, California The spy case discovered in San Diego yesterday has been resolved today. Justice Department officials have determined that the suspect, Japanese Villager, is innocent and has released him. According to Justice Department officials, the military port defense sketches found on Villager by the police are indeed garden designs in Villager's imagination. It is said that although Villager's car was parked near the Rosecrans Fortress, Villager was sitting silently inside. However, San Diego teenagers often do this, thousands of them every year. The Rosecrans Fortress is located on Point Loma, overlooking the city of San Diego. There are no signs prohibiting parking there, and from there, the lights of the distant city can be seen flickering on the beach, making it a rendezvous point for lovers.

<h3>Mussolini to Propose Six-Nation Pact</h3>
<p>To Replace Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact</p>
<p>(London) There have been various rumors recently about Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's diplomatic plans. The Labor Party's organ, the Daily Herald, commented on them, saying that Mussolini will propose a six-nation pact in the short term to replace the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, because the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact plan is bound to fail. It is argued that the four-power pact signed in Rome on July 15 last year by the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany should be expanded to include Poland and the Soviet Union, becoming a six-nation pact. The Daily Herald also said that the Italian Prime Minister's plan is a kind of exploratory nature. Mussolini will wait until French Foreign Minister Laval visits Rome before proposing a plan on Central European issues. At that time, Mussolini may not be satisfied with discussing the issue of Franco-Italian understanding. According to well-informed sources here, the date of Laval's visit to Italy has not yet been determined. It is said that Laval does not want to have in-depth talks with the Italian Prime Minister until he is sure that Italy's policy in Central Europe is compatible with France's policy. People here believe that Italy's conciliatory attitude in Geneva has created a good atmosphere for Franco-Italian agreement. Since Italy implemented fascism, the atmosphere has never been as good as it is today. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

The reason for this is that Germany is a powerful country very close to us, so we must maintain diplomatic relations with Germany. I firmly advocate being pro-German, as Germany is friendly to Hungary. I am even more inclined to present-day new Germany than to Germany during the Weimar era, because new Germany is implementing Bismarckianism. The last time I visited Germany, German leader Hitler personally declared his sympathy for Hungary.

<h3>British Officer to Command Saar Police Force, Germany Welcomes</h3>
<p>(London) Berlin political circles especially welcome the appointment of British Army Major General Brind as the commander of the international police force maintaining order during the Saar plebiscite.  Since Saar Governing Commission Chairman Knox and Major General Brind are both British, cooperation between them can be ensured.  German political circles particularly praise Britain's automatic assumption of this difficult international mission, which further proves that the spirit of the Locarno Treaty is not dead.  The British contingent, in addition to the 1st Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the Essex Regiment, also includes Royal Engineers, Signals, Medical and other groups, totaling 1,500 officers and soldiers.  They will arrive in the Saar before Christmas.  The 12th Rifle Brigade and eight armored vehicles will follow after Christmas.  Although Major General Brind is the commander of the international police force, the British contingent will be commanded by Brigade Commander Pulsterman.  All military equipment is in active duty status.  Two detachments of British soldiers arrived in Calais yesterday and are encamped in a certain fortress alongside French infantry, planning to depart continuously until Tuesday. Last night, the British House of Commons declared that the dispatched troops are not performing ordinary police duties and will be prepared to prevent disturbances. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Polish Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Warsaw Polish Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lancivir today published an important statement on Polish foreign policy in the newspaper, generally stating that the policies of some politicians dealing with Germany are based on a strategy of encirclement, which is quite inappropriate. Therefore, Poland has adopted a good policy of cooperation with Germany. In all respects, Poland is happy to agree with anything that brings about new common interests and does not contradict the aim of establishing harmonious relations with neighboring countries to seek peace and tranquility. Therefore, in addition to signing a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia, Poland has also signed an equal non-aggression treaty with Germany. As for France's view that Poland's policy towards Germany has shown a softening attitude, it is completely unfounded. The signing of the non-aggression treaty does not mean that various disputes between Poland and Germany have been written off. Even after the signing of the non-aggression treaty, neither Poland nor Germany has ever harbored such illusions. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

The Kra Isthmus is part of the Malay Peninsula belonging to Siam. Digging a canal only 30 kilometers or so in length would connect it. After the canal is completed, the Japanese naval fleet can enter and exit the China Sea and the Indian Ocean through it, and the naval base built by Britain in Singapore will no longer be able to stop it.

<h3>Decline of the Japanese Seiyukai Party</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Mr. Akita left the party, the internal strife within the Seiyukai has become increasingly apparent. There is now a so-called purification movement. For example, Mr. Tsusaki Naotake, due to his close relationship with Akita, also submitted a resignation letter to Secretary-General Wakamiya on the morning of the 13th. It is said that there are still many people following Akita in leaving the party. This means that the new party movement will advance further, and the crisis of the Seiyukai will become increasingly pressing. (Rengo, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Akita Kiyoshi's withdrawal from the Seiyukai has caused a major shock in the political world. Many expect Akita to organize a new political party with Tokonami, Uchida, Yamazaki, etc., who previously left the Seiyukai. However, based on the current situation, not many people will participate in the new party. They will temporarily cancel the extreme movement, wait for an opportunity to brew, and implement a major split in the Seiyukai. The Seiyukai will inevitably present a major chaos before the opening of the ordinary parliament. (Rengo, 13th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Declares War on Arms Dealers, Forms Committee to Control Arms Trade</h3>
<p>Drafting a Plan Similar to Wartime Regulations</p>
<p>Eliminating Profiteering and Guaranteeing Equal Distribution</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States government has begun to declare war on arms dealers. President Roosevelt convened subordinates today to organize a powerful general staff to implement opposition to arms dealers who profit from murder. Within hours of the President's declaration of war, the department held a meeting to begin drafting a mobilization plan. This plan is similar to the War Department's wartime mobilization regulations, meaning that the capital of arms dealers should be controlled by the government during wartime, and the price of arms should be regulated. The President's sudden move was the result of the Senate Arms Investigation Committee's discovery of various facts about the international activities of arms dealers. In addition to all cabinet members, the new staff currently being organized includes 15 prominent leaders from various sectors of the national economy, politics, finance, commerce, and labor. Senate Arms Investigation Committee Chairman Nye believes that the President's move is a bit premature. The White House intends to limit the arms industry, while DuPont CEO DuPont Eglini said that the President's proposal is very good. However, other than that, Mr. DuPont did not show any sign of satisfaction. President Roosevelt said that the plan drafted at this meeting should take into account human issues. During the European War, the mobilization was not equal, so frontline soldiers only received one dollar a day, while workers manufacturing arms lived comfortably in the United States and could earn eight to ten dollars a day. The current demand of veterans for immediate payment of pensions is also the result of this relationship. Mr. Roosevelt also said that his actions were not due to any international crisis, but only to consider what the United States should do in case of war. It is more appropriate to implement this kind of law only when there is no danger of war at present. However, in any case, this move is not a preparation for war. The President believes that this meeting can agree on a thorough plan, which he can submit in a special message after Congress opens. He also indicated that this plan will be one of the most important bills in the next Congress. Mr. Roosevelt further indicated that the scope of the discussion at the meeting will be very broad, not only from the perspective of the interests of arms dealers, but also from an economic point of view, and pay attention to the lessons learned from the European War. In addition to the cabinet members, attendees at the first meeting included former NRA Director General Johnson, US Army Chief of Staff McCard, Federal Railway Adjustment Director Eastman, President's International Trade Advisor Pick, prominent banker and economist Baruch, Undersecretary of the Navy Henry Roosevelt, Undersecretary of Agriculture Brain Trust Leader Tugwell, and Undersecretary of Labor McGrady. The government has always appointed committees, but never before have so many well-known figures gathered together. Therefore, the President's emphasis on this matter can be seen. The strangest thing is that none of the people in the Senate Investigation Committee expressed enthusiasm for this. Senator Vandenberg, a member of the Investigation Committee, said that he did not welcome this kind of cooperation, but he also knew that Congress was very willing to handle this matter itself. Chairman Nye, in addition to complaining that the timing was not ripe, also said that the various departments of the government were actually co-defendants with the arms dealers. The new committee will be named the "War Profits Committee." Mr. Baruch was elected as chairman. Mr. Baruch declared that limiting the activities of arms dealers by levying excessive profit tax is the most effective method. Mr. Baruch praised the Senate Investigation Committee very much, and said that there was no conflict between the two sides. It is learned that the plan drafted by the new committee is quite similar to the War Department's wartime regulations, including the following: (1) Organize an industrial control bureau, similar to the industrial bureau during the European War; (2) Guarantee equal distribution of labor; (4) Preserve the capital of the arms industry; (5) Establish special trade agencies to control the international trade of the arms industry.

<h3>The Truth About Arms Manufacturing in Various Countries</h3>
<p>British Vickers Factory Makes Huge Profits</p>
<p>Chamberlain and Simon are Both Major Shareholders</p>
<p>Zaharoff Became Rich by Selling Arms</p>
<p>Destroying Peace and Ruining Civilization</p>
<p>▲National Society Indian Calcutta Correspondence American submarine building office's electric boat company officials, in the Senate investigation committee announced that the American arms factory Vickers Armstrong and the American submarine building office electric boat company have signed a contract, all of which cannot be described in detail in a few words. The officials frankly admitted that they had paid commissions for South American business, and when the investigation began, they declared that the American company had paid Sir Zaharoff, a great financier, 150,000 pounds sterling between 1919 and 1930 as a kickback for receiving an order from the Spanish government in the United States to purchase submarines. This statement did not attract any attention at the time. But then who is Zaharoff? A few years ago, a poor Greek man named Zacharias came to England, that is, today's Sir Zaharoff, suddenly the largest arms dealer in the history of the world. Mr. Qi first made a profit from running dogs in the Balkans and the Near East. The South African War arose in response, and at that time he was quite close to Lloyd George. At that time, his private property was no less than one trillion gold yuan. Mr. Qi is now eighty years old, but his twilight years are still not enough to prevent him from making huge profits by manufacturing ordnance. The director of the American Electric Boat Company, Mr. Qi, is one of the greatest figures he has ever seen, and his admiration is evident from this. When we talk about Britain, we must think of the famous Vickers-Armstrong Ordnance Factory. It is said that the Vickers-Armstrong factory can always see the sunlight, because Italy, Japan, Spain, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand all have Vickers-Armstrong branch factories, and its business is also the most profitable. In 1932, the major shareholders of the Vickers factory were British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Chamberlain, Sir Austen Chamberlain, who won the 1925 Nobel Peace Prize, and Foreign Secretary Sir Simon, but Foreign Secretary Simon sold his shares last year. When the European War broke out in 1914, many people were forced to invest, such as the great philosopher Sir Balfour, the president of the YMCA, Sir Kinnett, and the chief pastor of St. Paul's Church, Angie, and three other priests were forced to invest in the Vickers factory. Sir Snowden (the Labor government's finance minister at the time had not yet been knighted) said in Congress, "If you throw a stone at the seat on the opposite side, it is impossible not to hurt a shareholder of an arms factory." Not long ago, when the war between Bolivia and Paraguay was still fierce, according to the spokesman of the authorities, "British ordnance factories freely supply ordnance to the two belligerent countries." The Times and the Manchester Guardian came out and made sharp remarks, scolding it as a fallacy, but this protest quickly subsided without a sound. In fact, the British government is unable to restrain these ordnance factories, and the latter do whatever they want, while the former humbly tolerates. The Vickers factory is like this, and the ordnance factories of various countries are also like this. Consider the French Schneider-Creusot Ordnance Company, whose owner is Mr. Schneider, who is the mastermind of hundreds of military supply warehouses in Europe. Then consider the Czech Skoda Company and the American ordnance warehouses. Before the European War, the Krupp Ordnance Factory supplied ordnance to 52 countries. During the war, it resisted the world on its own. After the war, it was bound by the Treaty of Versailles. The Krupp factory only makes locomotives, bridges, railway and other materials. In addition to the major ordnance factories we have already mentioned, there are still a large number of large and small arsenals. When the world's economic panic is at its height, the trade and export of its ordnance and ordnance suddenly increase sharply. Since 1928, the trade in ordnance has almost doubled. Mr. Kobayashi Ichizo, the director of the first-class Japanese company Tokyo Electric Power Company, said frankly, "The military industry of various countries is very prosperous. The war,</p>
<p>Raw materials can supply the needs of any scope for a while, and commodities cannot fill the market, so their prices are fortunate to be exempt from fluctuations and declines. This is a special nature of war raw materials, and it is also what we pay attention to." The above-mentioned major ordnance factories firmly grasp the whole of Europe in their palms, and grasp it very tightly, and bind it very severely. Those who talk about disarmament are purely empty theories that can only win the hearts of ordinary people. Unless the governments stop this kind of activity that destroys and ruins mankind, otherwise, if they increase their activity, there may be a war in the near future. These ordnance manufacturers are truly the enemies of peace, the enemies of progress, and the enemies of culture. Therefore, ordnance manufacturing should be restrained, so that the world can regain the dawn of peace from the terrible war.</p>
<h3>India-Italy Issue, British Parliament Ends Debate</h3>
<p>Labour Party Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>(London) The three-day debate in the House of Commons on the Indian Constitution ended today. The amendment proposed by the Labour Party, which advocated that the Indian Constitution Bill should be based on the report of the Labour Party representatives of the Mixed Committee, so as to stipulate that India should enjoy the status of an overseas autonomous region in the future, was finally rejected by 491 votes to 49.

In addition to the Labour Party, there were 75 Conservatives on the opposition side. The government's Indian case will be submitted to Congress at the beginning of the new year.

<h3>Italy Implements Equal Land Rights</h3>

<p>Occupational Group Council Passes Bill</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Occupational Group Council (that is, the legislative body that replaces Congress) recently passed a bill to transform large landlords into small and medium-sized landlords. Because Italian land is concentrated in large landlords, and most agricultural laborers wander around without land to cultivate, the government has enacted laws to distribute part of the land of large landlords to wandering farmers. Those who voluntarily transfer land will be compensated by the government for one-third of the land price, and those who are designated by the government to transfer land will be compensated by the government for the full land price.

<h3>Taking the Italian-American Route Back Home, Mao Bangchu and His Party Leave London</h3>
<p>(London) Mao Bangchu, director of the Chinese Aviation Inspection Group, issued a statement before departing from London today, taking the Italian-American route back home, thanking the British authorities everywhere for the generous treatment and sincere assistance given to the group.

From the initial stage of training pilots to the aviation technology of the Royal Air Force's fast aircraft, everything had been reviewed. Mao and others had to make comments after the inspection was completed, but they were bound to have a deep impression on the completeness of the British aviation organization. Mao especially paid attention to the trial work of the Farnborough Research Office. Mao had boarded a seaplane at Calshot. He felt that this aircraft was very versatile. Mao also boarded an automatic aircraft. Although Mao could not determine the military use of this aircraft, he thought it was very suitable for civil aviation. Mao and the members of the group visited the main aircraft manufacturing plants in England. Wherever they went, they were welcomed. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Problem of Huai Salt Transported by Sailing Ships</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain official of the Salt Administration said that the government should take into account the three items of people's food, commercial situation, and national tax when handling salt affairs, and that transportation by steamship is beneficial to these three, while transportation by sailing ship is the opposite. Because steamship transportation is tightly sealed and saves scattering and expenses, the salt quality is clean. Sailing ship transportation stops everywhere and is prone to theft, which not only harms national tax but also easily leads to uncleanliness. However, the salt authorities are now taking a prudent policy, gradually increasing the number of steamships, and at the same time trying to relieve workers to avoid unemployment.

<h3>Liu Xiang Arrived in Hankou Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Will Fly to Yichang Today, Then Transfer to Chongqing</p>
<p>To Go to the Front Lines to Supervise Suppression</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Xiang, traveling westward from Nanjing on the Wuxue steamer on the 10th, passed Jiujiang on the 12th, and arrived in Hankou at 11 AM on the 13th. Chief Zhang Lingjiu, representing Yu Weiyi, Qiu Jia, and others accompanied him. Liu stayed at the Central Bank and is scheduled to take a plane with Zhang Lingjiu and Zhang Biguo to Yichang on the 14th, then transfer to Chongqing to go to the front lines to supervise the suppression. Liu made a statement to reporters, roughly saying that this trip east to meet Chiang and the central authorities had resulted in concrete decisions regarding military and political affairs in Sichuan Province. In military affairs, there is a deadline to eliminate the remaining bandits. Currently, bandits in northern Sichuan are trying to flee to Sui and Xuan, resulting in fierce battles. Bandits in southern Sichuan are retreating to the border of Hunan, and the central government also has plans for suppression. After returning to Chongqing, I will go to Chengdu, and then to the front lines to make arrangements, and coordinate with the Shaanxi army for a general offensive. During this period, the central government will provide monthly aid of 800,000 yuan for bandit suppression expenses. In politics, a provincial government will be established, and finances will be reorganized. The central government will establish special commissioners to be responsible for national taxes. Finally, he said that everything he saw in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou was being constructed under the guidance of Chairman Chiang and was on a grand scale, which left a very good impression.

<h3>Northwestern Inspection Notes</h3>
<p>By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Old and New Relay Stations at Yandun Completely Destroyed by War</p>
<p>On the 16th, going west from Gedaying, two or three consecutive stations were short on water and grass. Camels travel slowly, especially at these impoverished stations. (It is commonly said that the route from Lanzhou to Suzhou is the wealthy eighteen stations, from Suzhou to Hami is the poor ten stations, and from Hami to Dihua is the neither rich nor poor eighteen stations. The route we are taking is precisely the poorest of the poor ten stations.) Empty-bellied and carrying heavy loads, it is truly difficult to proceed. Therefore, we decided to abandon camels for horses and travel with the entangled soldiers. The journey was across an endless sandy plain, with all the riders competing to be first. Only the sound of hooves and the sight of flying sand and dust were heard and seen. In a single day, we covered an estimated 180 li. The names of the stations we passed, starting from Gedaying, are: 40 li to "Kushui Jing" (Bitter Water Well), where the water contains saltpeter and alkali, causing drinkers to immediately suffer from diarrhea, let alone the bitter taste being hard to swallow. There are more than ten broken-walled yards, where the lonely and miserable mail carriers are pitiable. 70 li to "Yaodianzi" (Waist Shop), a circle of ruined walls, with a pond of green water nearby. The thirsty horses were about to drink, but everyone stopped them with whips. One horse's nose spurted fresh blood, and its chest and feet were like stocks, bleeding profusely as it walked. 70 li to "Gezi Yandun" (Grid Beacon Tower), abbreviated as Yandun. We dismounted to rest. The carcasses of dead horses and camels were constantly seen along the way, especially in the Yaodianzi section, where an average of one camel or horse died every four telegraph poles. It is said that on the thousand-li journey to Anxi and Hami, an average of one camel or horse dies every three li, totaling as many as 340 or 350 animals. The poverty of the "poor stations" can be imagined. However, if each station had shops with complete grass and fodder, and the camel drivers and owners did not abuse the animals, the deaths of camels and horses would not be so severe. That night, we arrived at Yandun, with the clock pointing to ten o'clock. The entangled soldiers led us to the home of a postal worker, where we piled our bedding on his heated kang (brick bed). In front of the kang was a stove, burning firewood vigorously, with the bottom end connected to the heated kang. Tea was being cooked on the stove.</p>
<p>Long Liushui Ka Long "Tuokute Man", aged 48, who could speak Chinese, was always by our side. According to him, his job is to specifically check travelers passing through. If they do not have a passport, they must be turned back. Since Ma Zhongying's two disturbances in Xinjiang in the 20th year, many poor people from Xinjiang have brought their families to the interior, fleeing to Long Liushui. If those without passports are turned back, then Hami City is still three stations away. They will have no way to survive after trekking through the Gobi Desert, which violates the law. Applying for a passport in Hami costs about several dozen taels of silver per person, which is not a big deal, but it requires submitting an application to the provincial government for approval by telegram, which is quite troublesome. Later, company commander "Tun Lan Kele" and others went out to feed the horses, and the Ka Long (checkpoint chief) held the reporter's hand again and said, "Sir, (a common form of address in Xinjiang) I want to make friends with you. When you meet Director Yao (Dr. Le), please tell him that 'Tuokute Man Man Ka Long is a good person, and Tuokute Man Man Ka Long also says Director Yao is a good person, and Young Director (Yao's son) is also a good person.' I am called</p>
<p>Tuokute Man Man Ka Long, please remember it firmly." Seeing his sincere attitude, although the reporter wanted to explain something, at least he had to explain that he dared not falsely assume the title of "Sir," but he did not want to disappoint or spoil his mood. Moreover, he had repeatedly told him about the reporter's mission, but he still seemed not to understand, so he had to nod in response to this ridiculous request, doing him a favor. He immediately looked triumphant, stroked his beard, and leaned back, but unexpectedly, a slight resistance like human movement suddenly occurred under the bedding he was leaning on. He seemed to sense something was amiss and asked with a cough, "Is it a cat?" The postman, hearing this, gave an irrelevant answer, calling out, "Get up, get up, let the adults sleep on the kang for a night!" Then, a young woman's head, with an displeased expression, lazily emerged from the bedding, seemingly still trying to put on clothes in the bedding. The Ka Long immediately spat on the ground and said, "Oh, sorry, I'm just an old man." He then jumped down from the kang, and the reporter also went outside to walk in the moonlight. There were about six or seven houses in the neighboring area, and the beams and rafters had all been dismantled and burned, leaving not a single complete room to live in. The bright moon shone askew, making us feel even more desolate. The well water in Yandun has a slight bitter taste, and there is a small amount of grassland nearby that can be used for wheat fields, but strong winds often blow, easily damaging crops. All grains and fodder from the stations west of Xingxingxia come from Qin City. Qin City is located on the southern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, where snowmelt can be used for irrigation, the land is fertile, and the agricultural production is abundant. The city is inhabited by farmers and merchants, with an estimated two hundred and several dozen Han households, totaling over a thousand people. There was a proposal to establish an Yiwu County in the 20th year, but unfortunately, the incident broke out, and the entire city was massacred, with less than one or two out of ten people surviving. As a result, fields and gardens were abandoned, and houses were in ruins. The stations that relied on the city for food supplies now have to seek supplies from Anxi and Hami even further away. However, the sandy land in each station is not entirely incapable of growing vegetables and wheat. It is only necessary to dig deep trenches to plant what are called "cellar seedlings," which (1) can access groundwater and retain moisture, (2) can reduce and avoid wind and sand disasters, and (3) the climate must be warmer than the ground, and sunlight can still directly penetrate. Cellar seedlings have these four benefits and can thrive. Two li east of Yandun is a ruin with the remains of a beacon tower and broken walls. The surrounding sandy land has crisscrossing earth embankments, and the sand is scaly, as if it had been plowed. It is said that this was the old Yandun relay station, which was moved to its present location after the Tongzhi Rebellion. Unexpectedly, it was destroyed by Ma Zhongying again. To restore the old appearance, in view of the current situation, it cannot be done in three or five years. Before Li, he put forward a condition, saying that as long as Tang Shixia completely returns the valuable items privately pledged by Tang to a certain bank to the Wang family, everything can be discussed. Tang Shixia had some difficulties with this, so the matter was shelved. The reason for Zai's concern is that the antiques secretly pledged by Tang to a certain bank will mature next summer, with the outstanding interest already reaching a huge 110,000 yuan. Among them are four pairs of the most precious agate bowls, which were tributes from Siam during the Jiaqing era. Antique dealers who have seen them said that each bowl can be worth three or four thousand yuan, and even more if sold to Westerners. In addition, there are many exquisite gold-inlaid jade items. The bank is planning to ship them to London after maturity to sell them at a good price. If this batch of antiques flows into Europe and America, it will be the second major loss of national treasures worthy of the attention of the Chinese people after the theft of antiques from the Forbidden City to Paris. It is reported that the authorities in Beiping and Tianjin have conducted some investigations and are preparing to closely monitor and detain these antiques when they are exported. (11th)</p>
<h3>Fujian-Jiangxi-Guangdong Border Designated as Pacification Zone</h3>
<p>Guangdong's Military Suppression of Bandits Comes to an End</p>
<p>Shantou Communication: After the remnants of the Red bandits fled west, the local order in the Fujian-Jiangxi border area gradually recovered. Western Fujian, including Shanghang, Wuping, and Yongding, was originally garrisoned by Huang Renhuan's division of the Guangdong Army, which has recently returned to defend the Guangdong border. The Second Brigade, consisting of Li Hengzhong and Wu Hanping's two regiments, returned to Jiaoling on the 4th. The southern Jiangxi area has been designated as the Sixth Pacification Zone, with Yu Hanmou as the Pacification Commissioner, overseeing the ten counties of Ganzhou, Nankang, Zhiyou, Chongyi, Xinfeng, Anyuan, Longnan, Dingnan, Qiannan, and Xunwu. Junmenling, originally belonging to Huichang County, belongs to the Fifth Zone. Luotang and below belong to Xunwu. Chen Cheng's troops have moved south from Ruijin to take over the defense. All previous organizations for supply stations and combat operations have come to an end. The troops stationed in the Chaozhou and Meizhou counties have also been working hard on pacification, actively organizing local guard teams, and focusing on security construction. (7th)</p>
<h3>Anqing Repairs City Walls and Builds Bunkers</h3>
<p>Organizing a City Defense Works Committee</p>
<p>Levying Commercial Donations and Rent</p>
<p>Anqing Communication: When Jin Youshu was the head of the Anqing Municipal Preparatory Office years ago, he dismantled the city walls around the northeast gates and opened roads to promote the prosperity of the city of Anqing. In recent years, bandit alarms have been frequent, and the authorities have temporarily added defense works to the dismantled areas. Recently, Sun Peifang, the magistrate of Huaining County, following Chairman Chiang's orders, invited gentry and businessmen from the provincial capital to form the Anqing City Defense Works Committee to repair the remaining city walls. This has been approved by the provincial government, and it is proposed to levy commercial donations in the city, collecting a quarter of the annual business tax at once. In addition, one month's rent will be collected from the city, borne by the landlords, and paid in two installments by the tenants, each time deducting half a month from the rent they should pay. The receipt for the payment will be used to offset the rent due to the landlords. The City Defense Committee will assign donation collectors, carrying receipts, and members of the Public Security Bureau will be dispatched to collect the donations. The committee is now actively surveying, soliciting bids from merchants, and preparing for construction. The county government has issued a notice urging merchants and people to pay the commercial donations and rent donations. The rent donations will be paid in November and December. If the November rent has already been paid to the landlords, it should be postponed from November to January 1935, and the tenants should still deduct it from the rent they should pay, so as to collect one month's rent, so that the two projects of repairing the city walls and building bunkers can be completed as soon as possible.

<h3>Guangdong News Industry Holds Memorial Service for Shi Liangcai</h3>
<p>All Organizations Sent Representatives to Attend</p>
<p>To Encourage Continued Spirit of Mr. Shi</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: On the 9th of this month, the Guangdong Newspaper Industry Association, the Guangdong Provincial Journalists' Association, and the Guangzhou Journalists' Association held a memorial service for Mr. Shi Liangcai, General Manager of the Shanghai Shen Bao, in the auditorium of the Provincial Public Education Center on Zhonghua North Road. On that day, six or seven hundred people from the entire news industry and journalists attended, and organizations such as the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Guangdong Machinery Industry Association, and Fangbian Hospital sent representatives to attend. The orphanage's silver band played music at the scene, and the atmosphere was solemn and tragic. The meeting began at noon. Students from the orphanage played mournful music. The presidium and representatives of the organizations took their seats separately. The entire assembly saluted the party and national flag, then bowed three times to Mr. Shi Liangcai's portrait and observed three minutes of silence. After reading the memorial oration, the chairman delivered the opening address and reported on Mr. Shi's life. Next, Tan Huiquan, the representative of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, delivered a speech, roughly saying that today is Mr. Shi's memorial service, and he was ordered to attend, feeling infinite grief. Moreover, the assassination of Mr. Shi gave rise to infinite thoughts. Mr. Shi worked hard in the news industry for more than ten years and achieved remarkable results, both using newspapers as the mouthpiece of the people and promoting cultural and social undertakings to seek happiness for the people. His great courage deserves to be a mentor to the people. The success of Mr. Shi's career benefited society, but unexpectedly, he was shot and killed by violent thugs on his way back from Haining. The reasons for the assassination and the identity of the murderers have not yet been solved. The thugs' disregard for the military police, their disregard for the law, and their indiscriminate killing of people are truly enemies of humanity. Mr. Shi devoted his life to promoting the evolution of society and seeking happiness for the people. His death seems to be without regret, but Mr. Shi's death is still a great loss to today's society. However, it is hoped that the news industry will continue Mr. Shi's past spirit and work together, so that today's memorial service for Mr. Shi will have meaning and value. After the speech, guests such as Zhou Qiying delivered speeches. Finally, mournful music was played again, and the meeting dispersed in solemnity. The memorial oration and elegiac couplets from various circles are omitted.</p>
<h3>Puyi's Sister-in-Law, Tang Shixia's Treachery</h3>
<p>The Story of Tang's Separation and Reunion with Her Husband Pujie</p>
<p>Will Act as a Female Spy to Pledge Allegiance to the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: Tang Shixia, the wife of Pujie, the younger brother of Puyi, the puppet ruler of Northeast China, is known in Beiping society as the Second Grandma Pujie. When the puppet organization was first established the year before last, she once gave a speech, frankly discussing with reporters in Beiping and Tianjin that "the puppet regime is completely a puppet of the Japanese, and I personally absolutely stand as a Chinese, and from a patriotic perspective, I will strive to oppose Puyi in the future, and divorce Pujie to show my determination." Her outspokenness was well-known at the time. Even today, when people talk about her, they still regard her as a fashionable noblewoman. Yesterday, I met an official who was closely related to the former Regent's Palace and learned about Tang Shixia's words and actions over the years and her recent secret activities, which are also related to the political situation in the puppet regime. Here is a description as follows: After Tang Shixia stole and sold a large number of important cultural relics and antiques from the former Regent's Palace in Beiping last year, she secretly pledged the remaining treasures (including the Song edition of the Thirteen Classics, which is related to culture, and Wang Xizhi's calligraphy) to a foreign bank in Dongjiaomin Lane, obtaining 400,000 yuan. She then took her male companion, a certain Mr. Si, and several personal servants, left Beiping for Shanghai. On the way, she hired two foreign warriors as bodyguards, and whenever passing through land and water checkpoints, these</p>
<p>large numbers of boxes and cages were rarely inspected because the two foreigners came forward to claim that they belonged to foreigners. After arriving in Shanghai, they secretly rented a large house on a certain road, and their whereabouts seemed to be less active, but the meaning was very secretive. Zaiyi, the former Regent who was trapped in the Beiping Wang Mansion, was afraid that Tang would ruin the family reputation and flee with the money, and that she would come to Beiping again to thoroughly extort money, so he reported it to the Public Security Bureau. On the one hand, he opened a list of the stolen antiques and treasures, requesting an investigation, and on the other hand, he reported all the existing public property and valuable items in the mansion, requesting that they be registered and protected. At the same time, he secretly transferred the grand mansion and private deposits in the Shichahai area to a certain foreigner and voluntarily paid a large amount of protection money each month, begging the foreigner to forcibly and illegally occupy the property in his name to prevent Tang's covetousness. According to Zaiyi's investigation, after Tang Shixia lived in Shanghai, she had a relationship with a young man surnamed Wang and changed her name to Shi Fenjia. This summer, she openly went to Qingdao with Wang to escape the heat. Before long, her relationship with Wang soured, and she went to Dalian alone. Later, unable to bear the monotonous life, she longed for a reconciliation with her husband Pujie, so she wrote to her father-in-law Zaiyi (Puyi's relative), elaborately explaining that her previous statement of loyalty to the Republic of China and scolding the puppet regime was a self-preservation and a means of protecting the property of the Beiping Mansion. In fact, her heart was still extremely loyal, and since she was ultimately Pujie's wife, she wanted to use a mask to operate between the Republic of China and the puppet regime, trying to contribute to Puyi, and so on. Zaiyi, upon receiving the letter, understood that Tang Shixia intended to undo what had been done, but Zaiyi deeply disapproved, so he wrote to his son Pujie, strongly urging him not to be</p>
<p>fooled by her. Pujie, hearing that his wife had expressed a desire to repent, could not</p>
<p>suppress his old affection, so he secretly went to Dalian from Changchun. After meeting, they cohabited, but ultimately, due to the fierce opposition from his parents-in-law and the puppet emperor Puyi's entourage, the reunion could not be realized. Seeing that this plan was difficult to sell, Tang Shixia changed her approach and eagerly wanted to do espionage work to gain merit and be seen by the puppet regime, and then negotiate with the Pujie family, hoping that the couple's reconciliation could be promoted by political power. With Tang's plan decided, she recently returned to Tianjin again, accompanied by several transformed guards from both the Japanese and puppet regimes, who provided protection along the way. After arriving in Tianjin, she stayed in the Asahi Street in the Japanese concession and acted unusually secretly. According to those who have seen Tang Shixia, Tang claims that her recent activities have been well received by the puppet regime, but she desperately hopes to cooperate with her husband Pujie and hopes for the understanding of her father-in-law. After this news spread, the remnants of the Qing Dynasty (because most of the surviving elders residing in Beiping and Tianjin are in the Northeast) came forward to mediate for Zai</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Xi Chan Temple Monk Forcibly Seizes Fenglong Temple Property</h3>
<p>The Xi Chan Temple monk Lan Feng, in regards to the issue of forcibly seizing the property of the Fenglong Temple, falsely accused the principal of Bailong Elementary School to the county court, alleging that the principal had instructed school workers to obstruct his freedom. Although the prosecutor's office had determined that there was no supporting evidence and declined to prosecute, monk Lan Feng, not giving up, appealed to the High Court for reconsideration, which ordered a retrial. Investigations reveal that the Fenglong Temple has historically been local government property, as recorded in the county chronicles. Later, because the temple was not regularly worshiped and lacked incense offerings, monks from Xi Chan Temple took it upon themselves to renovate it and convert it into monk quarters, claiming to be in charge and effectively seizing it. Last year, due to the increasing number of students at Bailongtan Elementary School and the inadequacy of school buildings, the school petitioned the education bureau, which forwarded the request to the provincial government. After deliberation, it was approved to allocate the temple to the school for use, with appropriate compensation to Lan Feng for renovation expenses. The school proceeded with the takeover and submitted a report to the education bureau for review and record. Simultaneously, it obtained approval from the education bureau to hire workers for construction. Unexpectedly, the monk continued to insist on the issue of ownership, falsely claiming that the original sixth-grade classroom of the school belonged to Xi Chan Temple, and falsely accused the school of encroachment in the county court. After several interrogations, the case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence. Undeterred, the monk repeatedly gathered monks, arbitrarily destroyed the fence built on the land, and engaged in vandalism and harassment, assaulting people. At the same time, he used a large brick to injure a school worker. The school worker, in self-defense, slightly resisted. The monk then colluded with incense-offering patrons to accuse the school principal of instructing the school worker to obstruct his freedom. After investigation, it was found that the principal had no criminal suspicion and was again not prosecuted. Unable to implicate the principal, the monk again appealed to the High Court for reconsideration. Now, all the teachers and students of the school believe that monk Lan Feng is intentionally creating trouble and undermining education, and have sent public letters to their fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai, calling for united support for justice.</p>
<h3>Ye Zongcheng Dies of Illness in His Hometown</h3>
<p>Ye Zongcheng, the director of the First National Tax Collection Office of this county, was previously reported for corruption in the conversion of rice into tribute grain. After being reported by local people, he was summoned and detained, and Yang Yunwen was appointed as the new director. Later, the provincial committee conducted an investigation and ordered Director Ye to progressively remit the funds, with the assurance of guarantee from Lu Longxiang, director of the fund production office, and Li Zongtai, the sixth district chief, and were approved by the department order. He was ordered to go to his hometown to collect the tributes of rice and grain in order to end this case. Unexpectedly, Ye requested to send two political police officers to Yang Luming's home in Caojing, but he did not know why he died at Yang's house this morning. It is said to be caused by phlegm asthma. The telegram county government transferred to the county court, prosecutor Zhu to go to the township for inspection. Ye's family members have also hired a car to go to the township to take care of the funeral.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zhuang Villagers Robbed</h3>
<p>Chen Ruitang's home, a villager in the eleventh village of Jiang Zhuang, in the eighth district, was robbed by more than a dozen bandits with local accents at about 12 o'clock the night before. They carried box guns, iron rulers, and other items, and forcibly robbed him of more than fifty single and lined garments, three silver bracelets, forty bolts of cloth, five leather jackets, and nine hemp sacks. Before leaving, they also beat the homeowner's son, A Jin, in the face and fled southeast. The area public office has reported to the county and asked for an arrest.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Another Robbery Occurs in Suzhou City</h3>
<p>Ma Chengji's soil plaster shop, number 52, in Bifengfang Lane, Zhongbi Palace Lane, Suzhou City, was suddenly entered by six burly men at about 7 pm on the 12th. All of them spoke with local accents. Four of them held handguns and rushed in, silencing anyone who tried to make a sound. They searched at will and robbed more than ninety taels of opium, more than one hundred and eighty silver dollars, more than one hundred and sixteen small silver coins, and various fractional notes and copper coins, and then fled with the loot. After the incident, the public security bureau ordered each branch office and station to conduct a night-long investigation and to check suspicious persons at each city gate, but to no avail. After investigation by various stations, more than ten suspects with suspicious appearances, including Wang Wanqing, Qian Damaizi, Yin Desheng, Shan Zhanyun, Xiao Lao Jiu, Xiao Haizhou, and Yao Zaisheng, were arrested and are being interrogated separately. The county government has reported to the Department of Civil Affairs for review and handling yesterday (the 13th). Since entering winter, four robberies have occurred in Suzhou City in less than two months. Residents with some wealth are all uneasy.</p>
<h3>Peng Gongfu Returns to Suzhou</h3>
<p>Peng Gongfu, a famous painter from Wumen, was previously recommended by the Zheng She Painting and Calligraphy Association to go to Peiping to organize the Zheng She Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition, which was highly praised by all sectors. Recently, the Wuxian sojourner's association in Beijing held an opening ceremony and invited Zheng She to exhibit. Peng was also entrusted to collect exhibits in Beijing, obtaining more than a hundred pieces of exquisite works, which he brought back to participate. Now that the event is over, he said he will return to Suzhou. It is said that after a little rest, he must respond to the invitations from members in Hankou, Guangdong, Japan, and other places, and go to hold exhibitions in turn.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Strict Prohibition of Extortion of Disaster Relief Fees</h3>
<p>The county government of this county has, in response to repeated provincial orders regarding the autumn disaster this year, stipulated that the county-wide general reduction should be the primary measure, preventing malpractices. Only completely barren fields should be exempted in full. Orders were issued to various districts to compile registers of barren land. Although the registers from various districts have been submitted, some districts have not yet finalized them, so they have not been announced. The original report from the district chiefs was for more than 225,000 mu, but after officials from the finance, civil affairs, and construction departments of the province came to Wuxi and conducted a joint survey with the county, the area was determined to be more than 148,000 mu. The procedures for verification and elimination are very complicated. Unexpectedly, district secretaries and map officials are using this as a means of making money, extorting barren land fees, reporting cultivated land as barren, and reporting barren land as cultivated, leading to numerous malpractices. The villagers are complaining and repeatedly submitting complaints to the county government. Yesterday, in addition to issuing a public notice strictly prohibiting such practices, the county government also instructed the district chiefs to promptly investigate and find out those who have been extorted, ordering the original handlers to refund all the money; otherwise, they should report them truthfully for legal action.</p>
<h3>Disputes over Extortion by Xicheng Company</h3>
<p>The Xicheng long-distance bus company has been repeatedly complained about by passengers because of the unfairness of the prescribed fares. Once, Bian Shang and other merchants and residents of Qingyang, at the junction of Xicheng, submitted a report to the provincial government. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. Yesterday, Chen Shengfu and Feng, two men from Yueqiao, Cheng, were holding round-trip tickets from the company. When they were about to take a bus back to Cheng at the Xizhan station, they were dragged down by the ticket inspector, saying that the ticket was out of date. Later, they were forced to go to the ticket office and pay four small silver coins per person. After Chen and others arrived, they said that the ticket had not expired, and that the company was extorting money. Therefore, they went to the town to report the information to the Second District Party Department, and then made serious negotiations with the Xicheng Company. I don’t know how to solve it.</p>
<h3>Injury of Police Officer in Gambling Arrest Case to be Handled by the Court</h3>
<p>Jin Bingchun, a patrol officer from the Anzhen Zhi Ba branch station, led police officers to arrest gamblers in the Zhou San Wang and Lin teahouses in Donghutang. Suddenly, a commotion broke out, and there was a conflict with the local defense corps. Both sides opened fire, and stray bullets accidentally injured police officer Su Kan (i.e., Su Sanbao) and beat Chen Lixiang and two others, which aroused a strike by the town's stores. Yesterday, Patrol Officer Jin came to the city from the countryside and reported the information to the public security bureau. Director Chen sent an official letter to the local branch court's prosecutor's office, requesting an injury examination. The chief prosecutor Qian sent a prosecutor and a coroner to the township to examine the injuries and ordered them to return home and seek medical treatment. At the same time, the county government also dispatched Zhu Wenying, the captain of the second squadron of the security team, and twenty soldiers to the scene of the incident to investigate. It was found that there were more than a dozen bullet holes in the wall of Wang Helin's house and several blood stains on the ground. The injured police officer Su Kan is being treated at Chen Tonghui's clinic. The prosecutor also confirmed the injury. After the town leader Wu Shouhuan and Captain Zhu persuaded them, half of the town's stores had resumed business as usual. The remaining stores are still on strike because the case has not been resolved. According to the merchants and residents of the area, the 22nd squadron of the defense corps does not have handguns, only rifles. The bullet holes that injured the police officer were caused by a handgun, which is probably a police accident injury. The case is now being handled by the court.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Bandit Wanted in Taixing Captured in Cheng</h3>
<p>Lu Shuxue, also known as Ma Dacheng, from Bachigou, Fifth District, Taixing, is 31 years old. He joined the bandit gang in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China. Under Li Fang (who has been executed), he participated in riots, burning, looting, and doing everything. Later, because of the tight arrest, Lu hid in the port area and became friends with the blind Tao, who opened a rattan shop, and became intimate with Liu Zhang, marrying her as his wife. Lu still went out as a bandit from time to time, returning with plenty of loot and savings. Those who did not know thought he was a businessman. This year, in the eighth month of the lunar calendar, because his whereabouts were known in the port area, he came to Jiang and lived in the Fengyuantai Rattan Shop at Xiaoxiangkou, Beiwai, renting a house from Zhang Rugen, who owned a barber shop. He disguised himself as a peanut factory cloth merchant to avoid attention. Later, after being detected by the Taixing County Government, on the 8th of this month, police officers were sent to Jiang to assist in the arrest. His friend sent a message to escape, only the rattan shop owner Feng Tongfu was taken away. The shop thought that Feng was implicated for no reason, so they went out to find out. Yesterday (the 12th) at 4 pm, Su Lingen, an apprentice from Chenbi Lane, Nanwai, saw Lu standing on the bow of a small boat in the Meijia Shuigoutou River in Banqiao. He secretly reported to the Fifth Squadron of the Nanwai Business Corps. The instructor Chen Yongsheng immediately led the members to go there. When Lu saw the situation, he tried to escape by swimming. The business corps fired a warning shot and chased him for about a mile. With the help of the villagers, Lu was captured. There were also accomplices Zhou Xiaozhang, Zhang Shuren, and Lu's mistress Liu Zhang on the boat, and they were all taken to the team headquarters. Lu confessed to being a bandit under the alias Wang Hui and having committed many crimes. He was taken to the hall that night, and after a brief interrogation by the investigation team, a long-distance call was made to the Taixing County Government, who sent police to Cheng to take him back for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Provincial Inspector Investigates Gambling Case</h3>
<p>Li Kaizhou, a police inspector from the Department of Civil Affairs of the Provincial Government, was ordered to investigate the public security facilities in Jiangyin and Jingjiang and has completed his duties. Recently, it was learned that Zhang Zhendong, a patrol officer from the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau, went to Yunting to arrest gamblers, and a conflict occurred between the police and the people. On the 11th, he went to investigate the truth and learned all the inside secrets. He returned to the city that day and reported to the province on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Danyang: Robbery of Rice Boat Injures People</h3>
<p>Zhu Lazi, a boatman from outside the south gate of the county, led his four sons from Jintan to Danyang with rice. When they arrived at Jinjiadu in Jiuli Town, it was getting dark, so they stopped overnight. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 in the middle of the night, a number of robbers, each holding a sharp weapon and speaking in mixed accents, rushed onto the boat, claiming to be checking the boat. Zhu thought it was true and opened the hatch, and was slashed on the head by the robbers. He resisted the pain, causing him and one of the robbers to fall into the water. His four sons heard the sound and rushed to get up, and fought the enemy separately. However, the robbers had weapons and the number of people was far from equal, and eventually the robbers robbed the boat and escaped. Later, the robber in the water was not good at swimming and was caught on the spot. At the same time, the nearby police station heard the news and arrived with armed reinforcements, searching everywhere, and caught another robber, who was immediately taken to the county for interrogation. The two robbers, Chen Yuanlong and Chen Hetang, confessed to the robbery of the rice boat. Zhu Lazi, the boatman, was seriously injured and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Local Bully Gathers Crowd to Rob Rice, Causing Trouble</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiao (nicknamed Mazi), Zhang Da Mao (nicknamed Xiazi), Zhang Suochuan, and others, local bullies in Maixi Village, Second District, are often colluding with unemployed vagrants to rob grain from people's fields. If they are offended, they set fire at night and burn things. The local people fear them like tigers. The night before, the local bullies gathered again and openly robbed more than ten stones of Yuandao rice. The owner shouted for help, but the neighbors were afraid of trouble and no one responded. After the local bullies divided the stolen rice, they divided it up and dried it in Zhang Rulin and others' yards, intending to dry it and sell it. The owner secretly identified the stolen goods and reported to the village chief and impartial people, inviting them to the yard to verify the stolen goods and order the workers to carry them back. Unexpectedly, the local bullies held knives and sticks and forcibly blocked them, provoking public anger. Everyone stepped forward and twisted the local bullies into the public hall, and reported to the Yanling branch station, which sent police to take the local bullies to the county.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Province Civilian Loan Office</h3>
<p>Will Begin Lending Soon</p>
<p>Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Zhao Dihua, Director of the Department of Finance, are concerned about the civilians of this province. In order to assist small business owners, they have proposed setting up a small loan office, which will be jointly operated by Jin Cheng, Farmers, and Jiangsu banks. Yesterday, a meeting was held at the Shanghai Jin Cheng Bank, and Wu Yunzhai, manager of Shanghai Jin Cheng Bank, Hou Houpei, deputy manager of Farmers Bank, and Tian Shitai, assistant of Jiangsu Bank, were appointed as directors of the board. Yang Zhaoxiong and Chen Qixiang were appointed as supervisors by the Department of Finance. The loan regulations and operating rules were approved, and Hou Houpei was elected as the managing director. The loan rules stipulate the use of funds, which are divided into four categories: (1) Purchasing goods or raw materials, (2) Adding tools for crafts and agricultural work, (3) Subsidies for promoting domestic goods, (4) Other production uses. Any small business owner in agriculture, industry, or commerce with a fixed address and legitimate business can apply for a loan. The general office is located at the Zhenjiang Farmers Bank, and the first office is located at the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Bank outside the city. It will be established and start lending in the near future. The minimum loan is one yuan, and the maximum shall not exceed two hundred yuan. In the future, small civilians will definitely benefit a lot. The office has a director and deputy director, who are said to be internally determined and will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Haiqi Disaster Victims Organize Collective Eating Groups</h3>
<p>This county suffered a prolonged drought this summer, and the autumn harvest was sharply reduced. Food shortages are severe in various districts, and people's hearts are panic-stricken, especially in Xiasha. Although local people have been running around and appealing to all parties for alms and relief, they have not received a penny so far. The disaster victims who lack food and clothing are forced to form groups and go out to beg for food, and incidents of harassment are heard every day. Recently, disaster victims in the north of Nanyang Village, Sixth District, organized collective eating groups to rob food from the homes of wealthy people in various villages. Disaster victims in the northeast of Qidong also responded, and the momentum is spreading rapidly. If the authorities do not provide relief urgently, the local security will be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Yinyang Town: Sea Bandits Land</h3>
<p>Yinyang Town, Qidong, is located on the east coast. The day before yesterday (the 10th) afternoon, a bandit ship suddenly arrived, and more than twenty sea bandits landed with weapons, robbing food. Before leaving, they also kidnapped three villagers. When the security team received the news and rushed to pursue them, the bandits had already left.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Prison Official Bribes on Behalf of Drug Offender</h3>
<p>The Nantong District Commissioner's Office learned that Zheng Ge, a prison official in Haimen County, bribed on behalf of drug offender Pu Zhuping and reported it to the High Court, which dismissed Zheng Ge from his post and transferred him to the Nantong Court for trial. On the 12th, Judge Shao of the Criminal Court interrogated Zheng Ge and took him into custody pending judgment.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Director of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Accused of Corruption</h3>
<p>Shi Jichang, director of the Jiangyi Gaobao Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau, has contracted the tobacco and alcohol tax from the provincial bureau. Since the quota has increased, the tobacco and alcohol merchants in the city and countryside are unable to pay. He once sent a letter to the county government, ordering the chairmen of the industry associations to comply with the regulations and make arrangements for payment. Subsequently, Teng Yizhai, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, mediated, and the eight industry associations, including Guanghuo, jointly recognized the tax of 1,400 silver coins per quarter. The approximately 500 shops that do not belong to the association are directly collected by the bureau. Unexpectedly, Director Shi was unable to obtain the department's license due to unpaid provincial taxes, and even imagined that the bureau would issue receipts and collect taxes from the shops. Later, fearing that people would report him, he sent staff to collect the receipts, which caused dissatisfaction among the tobacco and alcohol merchants, who questioned the bureau. It is heard that only a part of the receipts have been collected, and the merchants of the general intellectual class are unwilling to return them, as evidence of the director's corruption. At the same time, the eight industry associations, believing that Director Shi illegally collected taxes and deceived merchants, have collected evidence and submitted complaints to the Department of Finance and the Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, requesting investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Bandit Gang Robs Nunnery</h3>
<p>The Beisheng Nunnery in the North City of Fengjing has always been prosperous with incense. The eight or nine young nuns in the nunnery are good at flattery, so there are many pilgrims and the income is not bad, which has been coveted by bandits.

<h3>Victory Telegram from the Guangxi Army: Bandits Fleeing Guangxi Suffered a Total Rout</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that sources related to Guangxi province in this city recently received a victory telegram from the Guilin headquarters of the Guangxi bandit suppression army, which stated: "(1) Although the communist bandits claim to have more than 100,000 people in this all-out westward flight, they took an offensive posture after passing through southern Jiangxi and southern Hunan, and stayed in Yizhang for more than ten days, showing a leisurely attitude. Since arriving on the Guangxi border, their main force, the 358th Army Corps, was defeated by us in northern Guan, and many were captured. Their steps are now gradually disordered, and they are all fleeing west along the Yuecheng Ridge on the border of Xiyan Chetiian through Longsheng. (2) Our Xia (Wei) army followed closely in Xing'an territory at Simenqian, Qianjia Temple, and Jiangdi from Yu (the 6th), Yang (the 7th), Qi (the 8th), and Jia (the 9th), capturing more than a thousand people. Liao's army also achieved great success in intercepting and suppressing at Hekou Matijie, north of Longsheng, on Qi and Jia days. Even Yan Sengwu's battalion defeated Dong Zhentang's division of the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps and captured more than 600 people, which shows the bandits' panic. As of today, the total number of prisoners confirmed to have been captured is more than 5,000, not including those not yet reported. (3) Wei De and Wang Jiasui were surprised by our Liang Jin regiment at Qianjia Temple and rushed into the headquarters, and the bandit leaders fled in disarray. The number of military horses captured in this battle was very large. (4) Based on estimates of the bandits' marching routes and camping locations, there are at most only about 40,000 people remaining, exhausted and不堪. After the bandits left their nests, they have lost their foundation, and their combat effectiveness is indeed ordinary. Our army has dispatched large detachments to pursue and suppress them, hoping to join forces with friendly Hunan and Guizhou forces to attack and annihilate them. Guilin Headquarters, Jia Xu."</p>
<h3>After the Closure of the Private Postal Bureaus: Post Office Expands Facilities</h3>

<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Submits to the Central Government: Please Ban Empty Banks</h3>
<p>Bankruptcies Are Often Heard Of</p>
<p>Sufficient to Disrupt Finance</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters submitted a document to the Central Executive Committee yesterday, stating: "Submitting a case for forwarding. According to the report submitted by the Third District Party Headquarters affiliated to this association, it is believed that banks are the highest financial institutions, used to regulate the economy and stabilize society. How their capital should be sufficient is known to all. In recent times, the economy has collapsed, and all industries have declined. As a result, banks are the first to bear the brunt. Those with strong capital have no problems, but those who are usually empty are inevitably in danger. Therefore, various savings categories are widely established, or even high interest rates are offered to attract customers and make up for losses. However, transferring from east to west inevitably leads to inadequate resources. Therefore, bankruptcies are often heard of, disrupting society and harming the people, which is by no means insignificant. For this reason, the 88th Party Member Congress of the affiliated sub-department resolved to submit a request to your association to forward to the central government and the executive院,派members to conduct a thorough investigation of the capital of banks nationwide. If they are insufficient, take measures to rectify them, or order them to liquidate within a time limit, so as to ensure the stability of the social economy and prevent the people from suffering from bankruptcy, which is a public convenience, etc. Based on this, it is believed that the bankruptcy of banks that are not substantial has a very bad influence on the entire economy and harms society and the public. At a time when the national economy is declining and international finance is turbulent, if thorough investigation and suppression are not carried out, once flaws arise, what consequences will be left behind? Therefore, after the 98th Standing Committee meeting of this association, it was decided to forward it to the Municipal Executive Committee for discussion and recording. It is reasonable to submit a document to your association for review and approval, and to request your approval to forward it to the central government and forward it to the Executive院 for a thorough investigation to stabilize finance and benefit society, which is a party convenience, etc. According to this, it is found that what is said is indeed the truth. In addition to replying, it is reasonable to submit a document for forwarding, and to request your association to review and handle it, which is a party convenience. Sincerely submit to the Central Executive Committee", and so on.</p>

The art of transforming the people is to guide with virtue and especially to be consistent with etiquette. If the clothing is not harmonious, it is a disaster for oneself. Frugality and simplicity are the basis of etiquette. Our China has always been known as a land of etiquette and righteousness. The clothing of the upper country has long shaken the customs. Since the reform of political affairs, the large ceremonial dress, large ceremonial hat, regular ceremonial dress, and regular ceremonial hat have been clearly stipulated by the internal affairs department. Drawings and explanations have been attached, and the whole country has been instructed to guide the operation. The materials are mainly domestic products. However, after many years, the so-called formal attire and hats have not been seen to be guided. Even if there is guidance, most of them are not domestic products. For example, in folk celebrations or wearing Chinese clothes or Western clothes or square gowns and robes, the colors are mottled or the sleeves are short and narrow, and the forms are bizarre, even to the point of boasting about new products purchased from abroad, vying for beauty and splendor, exhausting the imported goods, men are like this, women are even worse, disregarding laws and regulations, laughing at friendly countries, nothing is more so than this, those who are different from animals and beasts are those who can understand etiquette and know how to love their country, those who cannot understand etiquette, then strange clothes and dresses are just to lose the respect of looking, those who do not know how to love their country, then barbarian cloth and Japanese robes can better see the overflow of rights and interests, in order to guide the new life, this association intends to ask that hereafter, if there are (1) weeks of commemoration and important meetings, (2) celebrations, funerals, etc., should be wearing formal attire, and public officials, except for the military police, should especially practice it in person, and order that when making formal attire, whether it is silk, wool, or cotton, all domestic products should be used, so that the clothes are neat and respectful, and the promotion of cloth will not overflow, matters related to the national system and people's livelihood, in addition to presenting the National Government, the Military Commission, the Executive院, and the Ministry of Interior, should be telegraphed to your meeting for review and approval, and promptly implemented, Chen Qicai, chairman of the Lake Society Committee, Luo Qinghua, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Silk and Satin Industry Association, Wang Shiqiang, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Industry Association, and so on, bow</p>

<h3>Qinghai Protector of the Nation Zen Master Minzhu'er's Mission to Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Raise Funds for Mongolian and Tibetan Primary Schools</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that Minzhu'er, the Director of the Qinghai Seven Hutuktu Office in Beijing, who is also the Pure Light Pure Cultivation Guangci Protector of the Nation Hongjiao Grand Protector of the Nation Zen Master, came to Shanghai recently to raise funds for the Qinghai Guanghui Temple Primary School, which he founded, with the introduction of Shi Qingyang, the Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. He stayed at the Dadong Hotel and took the opportunity to treat his dental disease. The reporter met Minzhu'er at his residence yesterday and inquired about the mission of this trip. According to him, Qinghai is located on the border and has a backward culture. In recent years, the central government has actively developed the Northwest and promoted education in the border areas. Although it has gradually progressed and changed its old appearance, the Tibetan ethnic group and the youth of various monasteries still have few opportunities to study. The temple in Qinghai was established as a new era in the establishment of schools in various monasteries in Qinghai. The National Government awarded the plaques "Teaching First and Nurturing Righteousness" and the Executive院 awarded the plaque "Promoting Culture" to show encouragement. All expenses in the school, which are required 600 yuan every day, are borne by the author. Last year, due to the sudden increase in students, the school building was added, and the expenses were huge and difficult to raise. So far, it has not been completed. After the start of school this term, there are a lot of textbooks and educational supplies needed. I sent someone to Shanghai to buy them, but they have not been bought because of the need for money. The fourth-grade students will graduate next spring. In order to facilitate further education, it is planned to expand the senior class to complete the fundamental basis of Mongolian and Tibetan education. However, the current situation is not easy to support, and development is difficult. Therefore, I discussed with Shi Qingyang, the Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to find a way. Mr. Shi is very caring and believes that if no way is found</p>
<p>rescue, it will inevitably lead to the interruption of education, which is a pity, we must rely on the power of gathering small efforts, and collect the power of everyone to make it easy, so introduced by Mr. Shi, to celebrities in Beijing and Shanghai, and those who care about Mongolian and Tibetan education,</p>
<p>Fundraising separately, the money donated, in addition to purchasing books and educational supplies, and allocating a part of the subsidy to school building expenses, the remaining number is deposited in the provincial treasury bank to be used as the school's fund, so that the Guanghui Temple Primary School has a basis for regular expenses, and border education can be perfected day by day. In the future, developing the Northwest, relying on the power of religion, and uniting to protect the border can also slightly relieve the central government's worries about Xigu and avoid the sigh of being unable to reach the whip. Moreover, the hearts of the people in Qing land are extremely corrupt, and most do not like their children to study. There are 240 students in this school, which is not easy, but I hope to continue to work hard, break through the difficulties, so that everyone has the opportunity to be educated and not be used by foreigners. I will stay in Shanghai for a few more days, and after the public is over, I will return to Nanjing.</p>

<p>時間已促亟須確定預算</p>
<p>Time Is Pressing; the Budget Needs to Be Determined Urgently</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu Tiecheng designated Guo Shun and Hu Xiyuan as conveners for the participation of Chinese domestic goods in the Philippine Carnival, the preparatory committee mutually elected Guo Shun as chairman and Hu Xiyuan as vice chairman.

Therefore, the preparatory office has sent another letter to the municipal government urging them to inquire and requesting them to specify the amount of the budget to facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Overseas Chinese Merchants from Singapore Come to Shanghai to Discuss Opening Overseas Markets for Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>籌備大規模展覧會</p>
<p>Preparing for a Large-Scale Exhibition</p>
<p>Lin Wentian, Chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and Lin Qingnian, Vice Chairman, believe that Singapore is a gathering place for overseas Chinese. Although there was previously a domestic goods exhibition hall, it only had an exhibition function and lacked practical sales methods. In order to promote the outward development of domestic goods, they specially dispatched representative Zhang Manshi to Shanghai a few days ago. Zhang went to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and contacted the chairman, Mr. Lin Kanghou, requesting him to cooperate with various domestic goods organizations and domestic goods manufacturers to discuss holding a large-scale domestic goods exhibition in Singapore. In the future, they will also promote domestic goods in Singapore in order to open up the Nanyang domestic goods market. Mr. Huang also brought a survey of daily necessities needed by overseas Chinese, along with the types and samples, urging domestic goods manufacturers to manufacture according to the samples in order to expand sales. After receiving him, Mr. Lin said that with the current promotion of domestic goods, this was a rare opportunity and agreed to notify the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene various domestic goods organizations and manufacturers within a few days to discuss a concrete plan, collect goods and samples, and study transportation methods in order to facilitate this grand event.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Revises Regulations for Chartered Rickshaw Licenses</h3>
<p>明年元旦起實行</p>
<p>Effective from New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently revised the licensing regulations for private rickshaws (i.e., chartered rickshaws) in accordance with the newly established principles to ensure consistency. The revised regulations will be implemented starting on January 1st. The provisions regarding the license plates on the vehicles will be implemented starting on April 1st. According to the regulations, chartered rickshaw licenses can only be issued for vehicles used by the owner for personal use or those hired for at least one month. Applicants applying for or renewing licenses must declare in writing that the vehicle is for personal use only; however, family members may also use it. If the applicant is a company or firm, the vehicle may not be used for the transportation of persons outside of the organization.</p>
<p>Those pulling chartered rickshaws must be licensed rickshaw pullers. The employer's name and vehicle number must be indicated on the rickshaw puller's license. If a vehicle is to employ more than one rickshaw puller, prior written permission from the Shanghai Municipal Council is required. Licensees must not allow their vehicles to be rented out or used to solicit passengers. Vehicles must not be used for advertising purposes, and must not be equipped with horns or other sound-producing devices. Licensees must report any changes of address to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Rickshaw pullers must be given a copy of the "Notice to Chartered Rickshaw Pullers" and instructed on the regulations to be followed.</p>
<p>Starting from April 1st of next year, chartered rickshaws will be issued with enamel license plates with white characters on a black background, which will be affixed to the left side of the vehicle. If the license plate is damaged or lost, a replacement will be issued upon payment of one silver dollar. In addition to the license plate, a small colored tag will be issued each quarter and affixed to the vehicle along with the license plate. The license plates are the property of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the licensee is responsible for their safekeeping. They must be returned to the issuing office when not in use. The license fee must be paid as long as the license plate is registered in the licensee's name, regardless of whether the vehicle is in use or not.</p>
<p>Chartered rickshaw licenses issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council are valid in the French Concession. However, residents should apply for licenses from the Public Concession or the French Concession depending on their place of residence. For companies or firms applying for licenses, the location of their principal office will determine where they should apply.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Iron Works Creates "Kai" Character Electric Sock Knitting Machine</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Iron Works, located at Gaoyang Temple, West Zhalankou, in this city, concerned about the backwardness of knitting machinery in our country, relying on more than ten years of manufacturing experience and two years of dedicated research, has successfully developed a new type of "Kai" character electric automatic sock knitting machine, adding a brilliant touch to China's knitting industry. The machine has five major advantages: (1) The sock knitting machine is fully automatic from the opening to the tip, without manual labor; (2) One person can manage five to ten machines, which is simple and labor-saving; (3) It produces men's and women's long socks quickly and at a low cost; (4) The socks are neat and have a suitable tightness, surpassing hand-operated machines many times over; (5) The labor cost for knitting various silk and wool socks is only four cents per dozen. Since the factory created the "Kai" character electric sock machine, knitting factories in various ports have purchased and used them, praising them unanimously as a powerful tool to resist foreign goods. The factory's distribution office is located at No. 202 Caishi Road, French Concession.</p>

<h3>Exposure of a Gambling Den Scam in the French Concession</h3>

<p>Demanding a Bribe of Up to 45,000 Yuan for Each Letter of Introduction</p>
<p>-探員喬裝資本家接洽始得破案-</p>
<p>-Detectives Pose as Capitalists to Negotiate and Crack the Case-</p>
<p>Recently, rumors have been spread that Mr. Meyrier, the Consul General of the French Concession, will be taking leave to return to his country. The new Consul will allow the opening of gambling dens in the Concession in view of the declining market in the Concession, with the aim of defrauding bribes. The matter was detected by the French Police, who sent personnel disguised as capitalists to feign negotiations for investment with the scammers. Eight members of the fraudulent gang have been arrested and sent to court for interrogation and investigation. The details of the case have been briefly reported. It is now known that the mastermind behind this case is Yang Yingchu (58 years old), a Cantonese residing at No. 13, Dakangfang, Baier Road, French Concession. Recently, he has been impoverished and bored. Upon learning that the current French Consul General will be taking leave to return to his country, he took the opportunity to spread rumors that the new Consul, in order to</p>
<h3>Revitalize the Concession's Economy,</h3>
<p>has been approved by the French government to allow the opening of five gambling dens in the French Concession. At the same time, he colluded with his fellow villager, Pan Shucan (32 years old, residing at No. 61, Sichuanli, Sichuan Road), to impersonate an advisor to Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Minister to France, falsely claiming that Pan could arrange for the movement to obtain a letter of introduction. At the same time, Yang ordered Cai Binshan (34 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 226 Caishi Road, French Concession, who was previously arrested and sent to court for a flower society case with a Mr. Hua, but was acquitted due to lack of evidence) to find capitalists to invest in opening gambling tables. Cai then entrusted Yang Dingguo (40 years old, from Guangdong, residing at No. 61, Hongli, Roberts Road) to find investors. Yang then, based on Cai's words,</p>
<h3>Engaged in Extensive Planning and Promotion.</h3>
<p>The matter was discovered by the French Police, who dispatched interpreter Jiang Futian, disguised as the accountant of capitalist Hong Bingan, and Zhang Zhongan, representing his employer Hong Bingan, to Room 202 of the Dadong Hotel on West Xinqiao Street on the afternoon of December 30th to invite Yang Dingguo to negotiate. Yang then invited Yang Yingchu and Pan Shucan to the scene. Pan claimed to be an advisor to Minister Gu, and Yang Yingchu and Pan told Jiang Futian, the disguised representative of the fake capitalist, that they could issue letters of introduction. Two letters had already been taken by someone surnamed Sun, and there were three more, each requiring a capital of one million yuan to be deposited in the bank. After the Consul General and Deputy Consul General confirmed the reality, the letters of introduction could be signed and issued, subject to a monthly payment of 225,000 yuan. At the same time, an "activity fee" of 45,000 yuan must be paid for each letter of introduction, and it was said that 35,000 yuan of this sum had to be handed over, with 10,000 yuan going to</p>
<h3>Those Handling the Matter.</h3>
<p>"You need to raise the money quickly, it shouldn't be delayed." At that time, Jiang feigned agreement and replied that he could discuss it with his employer, and agreed to talk again the next day. That night, they went to the Guangdong restaurant Tiantian Restaurant on Sichuan Road for dinner and dispersed. The next day, December 1, at noon, Jiang again invited Yang Dingguo to Room 301 of the Dafang Hotel at No. 33 Zhengjia Muqiao Street to discuss the matter. Yang then telephoned the Wu Palace Hotel and invited Yang Yingchu, Cai Binshan, Pan Shucan, and their accomplices Wang Boqing (50 years old, from Guangdong, residing at No. 1319 Roberts Road), Fu Fengshan (33 years old, from Guangdong, residing at No. 18 Yong'an Street), Pi Xichun (44 years old, from Hunan, residing at Room 25 of the Yixin Commercial Inn on Hunan Road), and Zhu Zhenhua (36 years old, from Changzhou, residing at No. 4 Hongfa Lane, Roberts Road) to the scene. At the same time, the police ordered interpreter Li Xianyang</p>
<h3>To Disguise Himself as a Capitalist,</h3>
<p>Hong Bingan, to the scene. On the other hand, they dispatched gambling detectives Cai Zongyi, He Zongyu, Zhu Junpei, Liu Delin, and Tan Rongxuan, led by detective leader Hang Bingquan, to lie in ambush in the Dafang Hotel. The two interpreters, Jiang and Li, who had been sent by the police to disguise themselves as capitalists, waited for Yang Yingchu and others to arrive before proceeding to negotiate all the conditions, agreeing to all of them. Yang and others then ordered that the capital of one million yuan be deposited in the Shanghai Bank and instructed that a long-term account be opened in the name of the group for them to carry out the procedures for obtaining the license. By evening, after the two parties had negotiated the conditions in detail, they signed a contract, agreeing that one party would raise funds and organize a gambling den, and the other party would carry out the procedures for obtaining the license. By the time the contract was signed, it was already 8:30 PM, and both parties</p>
<h3>Were About to Disperse.</h3>
<p>The undercover detectives who had been sent by the French Police came out and arrested Yang Yingchu, Cai Baoshan, Yang Dingguo, Pan Shucan, and their accomplices, a total of eight people, on the spot, without missing a single one. A document regarding the organization of a flower society was found on Yang Yingchu's person, and a contract document for organizing flower society gambling was also found during a search of Cai Baoshan's home. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. The case has been thoroughly investigated by the police, and the statements of each person have been recorded. Yesterday, Sun Penghang, a judge from the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, presided over the hearing. Yuan Jiahong, the police lawyer, stated the facts of the case and said that the first and fourth defendants, Yang Yingchu and Cai Baoshan,</p>
<h3>Habitually Committed Fraud.</h3>
<p>The police charged them with fraud under Article 364 of the Criminal Code, and the remaining defendants were charged with fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. At this point, official witness Jiang Futian appeared in court, and after being sworn in, he testified to the circumstances of being ordered to disguise himself as a representative of the capitalist and negotiating with the defendants Yang Dingguo, Yang Yingchu, Cai Baoshan, Pan Shucan, and others. Later, the court instructed the police to charge the first and fourth defendants under Article 364 of the Criminal Code, but there were problems with the handling of the case, so the court ruled that the case would be adjourned and transferred to the local court for trial at 9:00 AM on the 7th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Old Stamps from China and Foreign Countries Exempt from Import Tax</h3>

<p>The Jianghai Customs Issued a Public Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>Tang Haian, the Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, and Bertheau, the Customs Commissioner, issued a joint notice No. 1409 yesterday regarding the exemption of import taxes on old Chinese and foreign stamps: "Now, in compliance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, all old Chinese and foreign stamps imported from December 3rd of this year will be exempt from import tax. This is hereby notified to all merchants and people."</p>
<h3>The Xin Renhe Tragedy: Private Lawsuit Partially Settled</h3>
<p>以一千四百元了結</p>
<p>Settled for 1,400 Yuan</p>
<p>當庭繕就筆錄簽字</p>
<p>Minutes Prepared and Signed in Court</p>
<p>In March of last year, the Xin Renhe steamship of the Yu Yu Shipping Company in Nanshi, while sailing from Haimen back to Shanghai, tied up five peddlers on board, including Mei Laoer and Ma Koubao, with lead wire, attached them to large rocks, placed them in sacks, and threw them into the sea to drown. After the tragedy occurred, the victims' families learned of the previous situation and were extremely saddened and angry. They filed a lawsuit in the local court, and the ship's owner, Sun Xingsheng, the comprador, Chen Baosheng, and the bookkeeper and sailors were arrested, interrogated, and sentenced to life imprisonment or varying terms of imprisonment. In the private lawsuit portion, a judgment of over ten thousand yuan was issued, with each defendant jointly liable. Sun and others refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which ordered the case to be sent to Suzhou for trial. Recently, the court arrested two other crew members, Wu A'er and Li San, who were accomplices, interrogated them, and sentenced them to await instructions. It is now known that the private lawsuit portion has not yet been resolved. Recently, new employees on the ship and others, feeling that the families of the victims were all suffering, and that Sun Xingsheng and others had been imprisoned for a long time, and that their families were in dire straits, no less than the families of the victims, repeatedly negotiated and raised funds to distribute to the families of the victims to help them live. However, none of them were willing to come forward. Fan Si Rongqing came forward and was willing to act as a representative, entrusting lawyer Guo Yihua to submit a statement to the court, stating that funds had been raised for condolence. After receiving the submission, the court specially opened the Second Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, presided over by Judge Wang Run. The plaintiffs who reported to the court included Mei You (27 years old, from Hubei, wife of the deceased Mei Laoer), Zhou Ma (i.e., Zhang Ma, 32 years old, from Pinghu, wife of the deceased Zhou Jinsheng), Shen Zhou (48 years old, from Zhenjiang, wife of the deceased Shen Xianzhang), Ma Liu (43 years old, from Rugao, mother of the deceased Ma Koubao), and Wei Zhu (52 years old, from Anhui, mother of the deceased Wei Jinren). After the judge took his seat, he ordered each of the victims' families to come to the case and briefly interrogated them, according to which each of the corpses claimed that because the ship was carrying contraband items, it was seized by the police and thought to be reported by the deceased and others, so five people were brutally killed. Our livelihood has been cut off. When they finished speaking, they all wept sadly. Then, lawyer Guo stated that colleagues of the Yu Xing Company were now willing to offer condolences of 1,400 yuan, which had been agreed upon with the opposing lawyer Yu, and had been agreed to by the victims' families. The judge asked each of the victims' families, and there were no objections. They claimed that they requested to withdraw the private lawsuit and that they urgently wanted to return to their hometown to live. After the interrogating official obtained the confession, he prepared the minutes and ordered each of the victims' families to affix their fingerprints in court. At the same time, lawyer Guo presented a check for 1,400 yuan to the court. After the interrogating official examined it, he transferred it to lawyer Yu for collection. The victims' families thanked him and left.</p>
<h3>The Railway Bureau Absolutely Prohibits Waiters on Railway Dining Cars from Accepting Tips</h3>
<p>餐費收條上蓋有戳記</p>
<p>The Receipt for Meals Is Stamped</p>
<p>In addition to the cost of meals, passengers on the railway often give tips to the waiters. The Transportation Department believes that the dining car employees are hired and paid by the railway, and all services such as serving meals are their inherent responsibilities. The bad habit of demanding tips should be completely eradicated. Even if passengers voluntarily give tips, they should not be accepted without authorization in order to set an example of integrity. Therefore, the managers of each dining car have been notified that if any waiter is found to be soliciting tips from passengers in the future, in addition to severely punishing the offending waiter, the manager on duty will also be held jointly responsible. Even if passengers are willing to give tips, they should be politely declined and not accepted. On the other hand, the meal receipts are stamped with the words "Tipping is strictly prohibited, please help us maintain this," in order to prevent passengers from repeating old habits. Railway colleagues can also act as supervisors when riding the train to help with the rectification.</p>
<h3>Wu Nailong, a Teacher at Nanyang Advanced Commercial School, Dies After Jumping from a Window</h3>
<p>患病甚重𤍠度驟增</p>
<p>Seriously Ill with a Sudden Increase in Temperature</p>
<p>神經頓變態所致</p>
<p>Caused by a Sudden Change in Mental State</p>
<p>Wu Nailong, a 21-year-old Cantonese teacher at the Nanyang Advanced Commercial School on Shanhai Pass Road, lived at No. 1, Zhenqing Lane, Chuan Highway, Zhabei. Two weeks ago, Wu suffered from typhoid fever and was quite ill. Although he had consulted doctors, he had not yet recovered. Because there were many people in his family, the patient inevitably felt disturbed, so on the 11th of this month, his mother, Wu Lu, and others accompanied Nailong to the Shanghai Sanatorium Hospital on Bafu Road and resided in Room 400 on the fourth floor for treatment. Unexpectedly, the illness worsened suddenly the night before last, and the temperature suddenly increased to 105 degrees, causing his nerves to suddenly become abnormal. He walked to the window, jumped out, and fell to the ground. He died immediately due to severe injuries. After Chen Xuezhi, a nurse at the hospital, noticed it, she immediately reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered Chinese Detective Feng Qi to investigate. He then carried the body to the Feilun Road Verification Office. Yesterday morning, Tang, the prosecutor, was appointed by the First Special District Local Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wu Zuyi, to visit the office and verify the body. According to Chinese Captain Zhu Mengwei's report of the previous situation, Tang ordered that the deceased Nailong, male, had suffered from an illness and died from a fall. The body was handed over to Wu Yuanlong, Wu's brother, for coffin burial after he signed a statement.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Prepare for Children's Year</h3>
<p>已通過籌備委員會大綱</p>
<p>The Outline of the Preparatory Committee Has Been Approved</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Shanghai Chinese Benevolent Association had suggested to the two internal education departments the organizational outline of the China Children's Year Preparatory Committee, and the clothing and jewelry of the preparatory committee members, which were quite fashionable. Ning, a teacher who recently returned home, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and brought many local products from Ningbo. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, he planned to give a part of the local products to his family member, Zhang Yaozhang, who lives at No. 1, Taikang Lane, Dalin Road, Xiaoximen, who currently works at Qianxin Foreign Firm. Unexpectedly, just as he was about to carry the items out of the door, a bandit wearing a blue cloth short coat suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and followed him to the back door of No. 1 Taikang Lane. He took out a pistol and forbade him to make a sound, and snatched a gold bracelet worth more than 50 yuan from Yuan's arm. He then shouted for help. The lane guard, Ma Haiji, heard the alarm and chased after him, grabbing the bandit. The bandit, in desperation, fired a shot to warn him. It so happened that Zhao Jinguan, an 11-year-old apprentice from Pudong, Yangsi Bridge, No. 110 Huangjia Que Road, who runs the Jiang Yixing Cotton Shop, was passing by while shopping. The stray bullet hit his left waist, piercing it on the spot, and blood flowed like a river. The bandit took the opportunity to escape. The Sanguantang police station under the jurisdiction heard the alarm and immediately reported it to the Ximen branch, first sending Zhao Jinguan to the hospital for treatment, and then tracking down the murderer for arrest and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Forged Bill of Lading - Illicit Removal of a Large Quantity of Tea</h3>
<p>Colluding with Brokers for Sales</p>
<p>A Portion of the Stolen Goods Recovered</p>
<p>Zhang Wanquan, a Cantonese residing at No. 12, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road, is the owner of the Lily Wah Tea Company. All tea belonging to the company is stored at the Tiancheng Tea Warehouse, No. 7, Lane 576, North Shanxi Road. Normally, to withdraw tea, Zhang would stamp and write a bill of lading and present it for collection. Yu Yingxing, formerly an old clerk at Zhang's company, but now dismissed, still occasionally visited Zhang's residence for leisure. On the 8th of this month, Zhang wanted to withdraw a box of tea from the Tiancheng Tea Warehouse as a sample to sell to various colleagues. Because Zhang was not good at writing, he instructed Yu to write a bill of lading, which Zhang stamped, ordering him to collect the tea from Tiancheng. Unexpectedly, Yu had ill intentions and secretly hid the box of tea he withdrew. On one hand, he falsely told Zhang that the bill of lading was lost. On the other hand, he secretly forged the Lily Wah Tea Company's seal, wrote a bill of lading, and on the 9th, withdrew 26 boxes of tea from the Tiancheng Tea Warehouse, totaling a value of $694.50. He colluded with a broker from Huizhou, Wang Xiuchuan, and sold the tea to Zhu Yizhi, owner of the Yongxiang Tea Company, No. 77, Yuqing Lane, Tianshui Road, obtaining $416.70, which he spent. Zhang Wanquan learned of this and reported it to the Mixed Court Police Station, which dispatched detectives Yang Zhaoqing and Ma Ya to arrest Wang Xiuchuan in Zhabei the day before yesterday and bring him back to the police station. However, Yu Yingxing is still at large. Subsequently, guided by Wang, 26 boxes of the original stolen tea were recovered from the Zhengtai Tea Warehouse, No. 12, Pengcheng Lane, North Henan Road, and a box of tea and an empty box were found at the No. 5 Tea Market, Lane 313, Qipu Road, and all were transported back to the police station for temporary storage. Yesterday morning, Wang Xiuchuan was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court to be prosecuted for forgery under Article 233 of the Criminal Law. First, the police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the case and requested a postponement. Zhang Wanquan also complained about Yu and others forging the seal and illicitly withdrawing goods. Zhu Yizhi, owner of the Yongxiang Company, testified that the tea was brought to him by broker Wang Xiuchuan, who claimed to be the manager of the Lily Wah Tea Company, and asked him to sell it. He bought it at the market price, at $20 per dan, for a total of $416.70. When questioned, Wang Xiuchuan confessed that the tea was brought by Yu Yingxing, who claimed to be the manager of the Lily Wah Tea Company, and asked him to sell it. He only received a commission of $30, and Yu took the rest of the money. After verification of the confession by Judge Liu Yugui, Wang was allowed to be released on bail of $400 and to appear whenever summoned. The case was postponed for seven days for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of the Dingsheng Comprador Case Solved - Li Shanting's Coffin Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Case Was Solved After Two Years and Four Months</p>
<p>The Ring Leader Injured His Paramour's Husband, The Wife and Her Husband Reported Him Out of Extreme Anger</p>
<p>The Dingsheng ship, belonging to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., was stolen in Tianjin, taking the comprador Li Shanting and the dockside accountant Zhang, on August 13th of the year before last. Two years and four months passed without solving the case. Now, the main culprit has been arrested in Tianjin. Li Shanting was killed and his body arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The matter is quite tortuous. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Revisit the Old Matter</h3>
<p>The Dingsheng ship of British merchant Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. was a regular Northern shipping vessel. The ship arrived at Tanggu, Tianjin on August 13th (year 21 of the Republic). Li Shanting was in the ship's accounting office. At around 5 p.m., several cars suddenly arrived, and the ring leader led his gang onto the ship to kidnap Li. Li locked the accounting office door, and the bandits could not open it, so they shot off the cabin door lock, then entered and took Li onto the car and fled. Zhang, the dockside accountant, was also kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shot Dead First</h3>
<p>After the case occurred, the British consulate negotiated with the North China authorities, ordering them to rescue Zhang and Li, and to eliminate the bandits. The Tianjin military and police authorities obtained a tip and discovered the bandit's lair more than 40 miles from Tianjin. A team was dispatched to suppress them, and a confrontation occurred. Zhang, the dockside accountant, was nearly 60 years old and escaped from the bandit's nest, but was shot dead by the bandits on the way. Li Shanting was kidnapped by the ring leader and escaped. This occurred during the winter of that year. Since then, there has been no news of Li's whereabouts.</p>
<h3>Bandit's Wife Turns Against Him</h3>
<p>The ring leader was rumored to be a military officer from a defeated warlord. He took Li Shanting and fled, and his wife and others were in Tianjin. Later, due to the lack of news, the bandit's wife suspected that her husband was dead and had an affair with another man in Tianjin. Until October of this year, when the case was fading, the ring leader secretly returned to Tianjin to look for his wife. He heard that she had already had an affair with someone and had a major conflict with the paramour. The ring leader used a pistol to injure the paramour. His wife turned against him and reported to the military authorities, stating the facts of the kidnapping for ransom and resisting officers two years ago. An old case from over two years ago was solved due to a dispute over a wife.</p>
<h3>Li's Body Discovered</h3>
<p>The ring leader was arrested by the Tianjin authorities in October. The reason for kidnapping Li Shanting, the comprador of Dingsheng, was investigated. The bandit said that Li refused to send a letter to his family to pay a huge sum, so he was shot dead. The bandit collected the body and buried it in a coffin worth over $130, intending to use it as a step to make his family pay a ransom to redeem the body. Later, the coffin was located and examined, and after confirmation, the military and police authorities notified the Tianjin branch of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and wired Shanghai, ordering Li's family to go to Tianjin to claim the body and return to Shanghai for burial.</p>
<h3>Coffin Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>After Li Shanting's wife received the news, she went to Tianjin to claim her husband's body and escorted the coffin to Shanghai for burial. Li's wife went north on the Dingsheng ship, and now she has received her husband's coffin and is returning to Shanghai on the Dingsheng ship. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Wednesday, but was delayed by one day due to fog on the way. It entered the port at 6:30 a.m. yesterday and arrived at the dock at about 8 a.m., where it was unloaded and prepared to be transported to the ancestral home for burial.</p>
<h3>Cheng Yushu Accuses Sang Zhichuan of Abandonment</h3>
<p>Fifty Years Old and Still Seeking Pleasure</p>
<p>Abandonment Soon After Giving Birth</p>
<p>Sang Zhichuan, a Ningbo native residing at No. 58, Changyun Lane, No. 468, Dagu Road, is 56 years old and runs a leather trunk shop. He has many children who have grown up and started families. However, Sang, past his prime, still indulged in seeking pleasure outside. On September 1st of last year, he met Cheng Yushu, a Cantonese woman, who was only twenty years old. Sang immediately seduced her to a hotel and committed adultery. Because Sang had a wife, Cheng could only become a concubine. She rented a house outside and lived secretly. In a few months, Cheng became pregnant. On July 4th of this year, she gave birth to a son at the Zhongde Hospital. Unexpectedly, Sang recently changed his behavior and not only ignored Cheng's life but also beat and abused her. Cheng Yushu hired a lawyer and filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Sang Zhichuan and his eldest son, Sang Jianzhang, second son, Sang Jianheng, third son, Fuyuan, and Fuyuan's wife, Ms. Hu, of abandonment and encroachment, and also filed a civil lawsuit for $18,700. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the trial at the Eighth Criminal Division. Of the five defendants, only Sang Zhichuan appeared in court. The plaintiff, Sang Cheng Yushu, held her five-month-old child and claimed that on September 1st of last year, Sang Zhichuan forcibly raped her at the Central Hotel and stated that he already had a wife, advising her to temporarily become a concubine. She had no choice but to agree. On October 1st, she rented a room at No. 361, Dahua Apartment, and began living together. About two months later, on December 22nd, she moved to his home at No. 86, Changyun Lane, Dagu Road. As soon as she arrived at his home, she was resented by his sons and daughters-in-law. First, they insulted her, then they used force and beat her. At that time, they went to the Xinza Gate Police Station, and the head instructed them to return for self-mediation. That evening, his sons and daughters-in-law robbed all her belongings and drove her away. Later, after mediation, she made peace with Sang Zhichuan and continued to live together at No. 39, Ronggui Lane, Avenue Haig. Before half a month had passed, another rift occurred. Because she had nowhere to live, she temporarily resided at No. 22, Xinshun Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei, at the home of her foster father, Wang Jinshan. All her daily expenses were also paid by Wang. Unexpectedly, on the 21st of last month, Sang gathered a crowd and suddenly came to her place, making all kinds of noise and forcing her to go with him, causing a major dispute on the way. The police took them to the Fourth District Police Bureau, where Sang pointed her out as his runaway concubine, who had taken his belongings worth over $600, resulting in her being detained. Later, she was transferred to the court prosecutor's office for investigation, which resulted in a decision not to prosecute. Therefore, she is now filing a lawsuit, accusing Sang and others of abandonment and encroachment, and requesting that they be punished according to the law. When questioned, Sang Zhichuan confessed that the plaintiff was his concubine, but now his legal wife had committed suicide because of the plaintiff, so she could be made his legal wife. The child she was holding was indeed his. Now, he could order her to go home, otherwise she was committing adultery with Wang Jin, occupying another man's wife, and taking someone's child, and should be investigated. Judge Wu advised the plaintiff to go home, but she resolutely refused, only requesting that the law be strictly enforced. The court ordered that the case be postponed for seven days, pending the summons of Sang Jianzhang and others for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Relocation of the Waste Meat Disposal Plant</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department abattoir has an attached waste meat disposal plant for destroying meat unfit for consumption. Recently, the machinery in this plant has become too small and insufficient for use. Next year, the equipment needs to be expanded. The board of directors, based on the recommendations of the health and finance committees, has decided to relocate the plant to another building at No. 320, Section 3 East, to prepare for the handling of waste meat sent from the abattoir and outside. $95,000 will be allocated in next year's budget to meet this need.</p>

<p>The China-America Tobacco Company established the Guanghua Scholarship for the Election of Standard Great Persons in Chinese History, which is an expansion of last year's Buy-A-Car Scholarship.

The deadline is at the end of this month. With the goal in sight, the elections from all sides are becoming increasingly heated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank - Handling Tobacco Loans in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Organizing Production and Sales Cooperatives to Be Established Within the Year</p>
<p>Cotton Loans in Shaanxi Province Will Expand in Amount</p>
<p>In recent years, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank has been quite active in investing in rural areas. Recently, it plans to provide tobacco loans in Qingzhou and Xuzhou, Shandong Province. The existing cotton cooperative in Shaanxi will expand its organization and increase the amount of investment. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Handling Tobacco Loans in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>According to the bank's spokesperson, the output of silk tobacco in Shandong Province is increasing daily. There are more than 300 production and sales cooperatives in Linzi and other places. The results of the silkworm loans issued by the bank through the cooperatives last year were very satisfactory. Recently, it is planned to establish a tobacco production and sales cooperative in Qingzhou, with the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute responsible for production guidance, the Shandong Provincial Construction Department responsible for organization, and the bank responsible for loans. It can be established within the year, preparing for the tobacco loans.</p>
<h3>Expanding Investment in Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>In addition, the six major cotton production and sales cooperatives established by the bank in Shaanxi Province and the eight major cooperatives organized by the China Continent and other five banks have had very poor results since the cotton loans began. The borrowers and lenders have a good relationship. In order to expand the scope of its loans, the bank plans to add several cooperatives next year. However, the specific plan is still under negotiation, and the exact number has not been determined. The business will still focus on cotton loans.</p>
<h3>The Reputation of Vita-C Bao Ming</h3>
<p>Xinyi Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, No. 20, Avenue Massenet, Shanghai, issues Chang Ming brand Vita-C Bao Ming, which mainly treats neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, spermatorrhea, anemia, insomnia, poor appetite, beriberi, postpartum, post-illness, and opium addiction. It is the highest authority of supplements. The medicine is divided into male and female types. The pills are divided into fifty pills and one hundred pills. Injectables are packaged in boxes of ten tubes, each tube containing two grams. Now, in order to make all circles recognize the efficacy of this medicine, a sample of 15 pills per box will be given away for five dimes. However, this trial sample period is only limited to the end of March of the 24th year, and will be invalid after the deadline. At this time of winter supplementation, it would be a pity to miss Xinyi Chang Ming brand vitamin.</p>
<h3>Giving Away Winter Clothes for Babies</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Wu Tiecheng, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Li Dachao, Yuan Ludeng, and others, founders of the Pingmin Obstetrics Hospital in Tilanqiao Hongkou, and the hospital director, Wang Boyuan, have always held the spirit of serving society and saving the economy of the common people. They provide free delivery for poor pregnant women and set up clinics at the intersection of Tongzhou Road, charging nothing, which has gained the trust of society. Recently, it has been observed that many impoverished pregnant women who give birth in the hospital lack winter clothes for their babies, which is very pitiful. Wang Boyuan specially made many winter clothes for babies and gave them to the poor pregnant women, which is truly a benevolent act.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of Zhang Yuguang's Painting Exhibition</h3>

The exhibition is scheduled to last for four days.</p>
<h3>After the Closure of Chengchang Native Cloth Store</h3>
<p>Large Deposit Amounts, Creditors Continue to File Lawsuits</p>
<p>Chengchang Native Cloth Store, a well-known store in the South City of Shanghai, was affected by the January 28th Incident, and its business was sluggish. Subsequently, in February of the 22nd year, it entrusted accountant Chao Jimei and lawyer Xue Lisheng to announce liquidation. However, Chengchang was an old store with decades of business and had annual profits. Because its credit was solid, it had many deposits in various places. Once it suddenly announced liquidation and repaid debts proportionally, the creditors protested. At that time, six creditors, including Chen Xiuji, had deposits of more than 10,000 and hired a lawyer separately to file a lawsuit against the store's manager, Qiao Qiupu. However, because Qiao Qiupu had no assets to execute, there were no results. Now, Chen Xiuji and others have learned that Chengchang is a partnership store, and its shareholders, such as Zhou Chunji and Li Xinji, own large amounts of assets in Shanghai. Therefore, they have re-hired lawyer Zhang Baotang, collected evidence, and filed lawsuits against the shareholders. It is heard that a judgment has been made, ordering the shareholders to jointly repay Chen Xiuji and others' deposits of more than 8,000 yuan and interest.</p>

<h3>Incoming Correspondence: Which Policy Should China Adopt to Deal with World Changes? (Continued)</h3>
<p>Lecture by Zhang Yuanruo (Notes by Li Guangteng)</p>
<p>Some people may think that my theory is impossible, but I can say with certainty that this is not just a theory, it is indeed a current trend. It is not an overly optimistic fantasy, but an extremely possible conjecture. Anyone who understands the current world situation and is familiar with the national conditions of Japan will have the same view. If we want to defeat Japan, we must first know ourselves and our enemy, and we must understand Japan's position and have insight into their psychology in order to be successful. Although Japan is extremely aggressive towards China, they have long anticipated the crisis of 1936, and they are indeed afraid of the arrival of this crisis and regard it as the most serious national crisis. They are exactly what is called "outwardly strong but inwardly weak." Recently, the Japanese military department published a booklet, "The Essence of National Defense and its Strengthening," which contains the same panic as I have described. It can be seen that this is not just my personal prejudice. Therefore, they are now actively engaged in defeating the united front of China, Russia, the United States, and Britain, and are urgently working to prevent Russia and unite with the United States and Britain. (Regarding this point, it is a specialized issue. Today, I will only briefly explain how Japan is currently using all its ingenuity to sow discord, isolate China, and achieve its desires. Details will be discussed separately.) Therefore, now that we are in this time of urgent crisis, whether we can safely overcome the difficulties depends entirely on whether we can implement my proposal and my strategy. This is definitely something that can be predicted.</p>
<p>Speaking of the diplomatic status between China and Japan, our country is inherently superior to Japan. However, we cannot analyze the international situation and do not use the opportunities that are favorable to us, so that although our country's status is superior, we cannot obtain any benefits. Japan's status is isolated, but because they are good at utilizing it, they are actually superior to our country. This is a very worrying thing. If our government authorities can earnestly formulate a plan based on the principles I have talked about today and implement it diligently, I think it will definitely be effective. We must know that in international diplomacy, there is no right or wrong, no emotion, no chastity, no justice. What exists is only interest. What dominates the entire world situation is economics. (I published a book "Economic Observation of International Problems" in Minzhi Bookstore before, which explains it in detail, please refer to it.) What determines a country's diplomatic strategy is also economics and interests. From the above discussion, we have clearly understood that our country is currently in an extremely dangerous period. If we want to break this crisis, we must thoroughly understand the world situation and the actual interests of various countries in order to determine our diplomatic strategy. We must use it based on interests and obtain a favorable diplomatic position. All naive alliances and disconnections are inherently naive, and all false courtesy and connections are especially futile. (D) The response policies I mentioned earlier are actually only temporary solutions. When it comes to fundamental solutions, the first is that the people of the whole country can [rely on themselves]. I have recently advocated [self-reliance doctrine, which was published in Shenxin Shishi and other newspapers in October and November of this year]. Why do I say this? Because diplomacy only talks about interests. If we have no power, how can the great powers be willing to form alliances and connections with us? Therefore, fundamentally, we must cultivate our own strength so that they will look up to us and unite with us. This is the most basic condition and the fundamental principle for saving the country, surviving, and revitalizing the nation. (End)</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team Captures a Female Bandit on the Xin Ningshao Steamer</h3>
<p>The Bandit is only in Her Twenties and Fashionably Dressed</p>
<p>A Handgun and Bullets Were Found in Her Suitcase</p>
<p>Her Testimony is Incoherent and She Has Been Handed Over to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The Xin Ningshao steamer, operated by the Ningshao Company in this city, which runs the Shanghai-Ningbo line, set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 10th of this month. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, when the ship was about to set sail, a young female bandit carrying weapons was captured by the police officers of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team in cabin 62 of the ship. After an interrogation by the Water Patrol General Team, she has now been handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for disposition. A Datong News Agency reporter has investigated and reported the details below.</p>
<h3>The Female Passenger Looked Flustered</h3>
<p>The Xin Ningshao steamer was preparing to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on the afternoon of the 10th. At around 3:00 PM, a young female passenger booked cabin 62 with Zhang Jinzhong, a waiter on the ship. After placing her small mesh basket, clothing bag, and fruit in the cabin, she went ashore because it was still early before the ship sailed. At about 5:00 PM, the female passenger returned with a small leather suitcase. When she was about to board the ship at the lower station pier, she was spotted by Li Yunting, a police officer of the Water Patrol Team, who noticed that she looked quite flustered.</p>
<h3>A Handgun was Found in Her Suitcase</h3>
<p>The police officer immediately joined the ship's escort police and followed her into cabin 62 for inspection. When they inspected her small leather suitcase, the female passenger suddenly claimed that she had forgotten the key at home. After speaking, she immediately got up and tried to escape. The police officers stopped her and found the key on her person. They opened the suitcase and found a handgun with the number 241560, and two rows of bullets, each row with eight bullets, a total of sixteen bullets. When the female passenger saw that her actions had been exposed, she immediately took out a gold bracelet and two finger rings and offered them as bribes to avoid further investigation. The police officers refused and placed her under guard.</p>
<h3>A Thorough Search of the Ship's Cabins</h3>
<p>The shipowner, upon hearing the news, feared that there were still accomplices hiding, and immediately ordered all the escort police officers to conduct a detailed inspection of the luggage and belongings of passengers in each cabin. No other contraband was found. The female bandit, along with her luggage and prohibited items, was escorted by the water police officer Li Yunting to the Dongjiadu Water Patrol General Team for investigation. Therefore, the ship's departure from the Bund was delayed until after 6:00 PM, more than an hour later than the usual departure time.</p>
<h3>The Female Bandit's Testimony is Incoherent</h3>
<p>After the female bandit was escorted to the Water Patrol General Team, she was strictly interrogated by the General Team Leader, Mr. Zhu Haishan. She has now been handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for disposition. Her testimony at the Water Patrol Team is recorded below. Wu Zhangshi, 24 years old, from Ningbo, her husband is called Wu Wenpei, from Anhui, working as a coppersmith in France, location unknown. The handgun belongs to my husband's friend called Sun Ruifu, with a leather suitcase, entrusted me to take it to his home in Zhoushan, Ningbo. He is going to Zhuangyuan Bridge in Zhoushan. I have no place in Shanghai. My uncle runs the Ruichang Machine Factory on Tongzhou Road. I don't know there are handguns in the suitcase, etc.</p>
<h3>The Evidence is Very Valuable</h3>
<p>The evidence seized was also sent by the team to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for safekeeping. The list of evidence is as follows: two mesh baskets, one bundle, one leather suitcase, one handgun, sixteen bullets, two bullet clips, one pair of gemstone gold earrings, one gold bracelet, two gold rings, two gemstone rings, eighty yuan in banknotes (including one five-yuan counterfeit banknote from the Central Bank), one cigarette case, two baskets of fruit.</p>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Sixth Chapter: A Poor Girl Does Not Feel Ashamed to Teach, Viewing Western Teachers as Unworthy of Respect, Vainly Humiliating One's Mind</p>
<p>Jia Duocai also knew that Aunt Hu herself felt embarrassed; she was just making conversation. He pointed to the square stool near the door and said to her, "Just sit here." After speaking, he smiled and said to Yueying, "There, there's a chair here, sit down." As he spoke, he gestured with his mouth towards the corner of the wall. Clearly, he had a different attitude towards Yueying. Yueying felt even more embarrassed by his appearance, and just lowered her head and fiddled with her buttons. Aunt Hu had already sat down, but seeing that she still looked embarrassed, she stood up again, grabbed Yueying's sleeve, and dragged her towards the empty chair over there, laughing, "At home, you can say anything, why don't you say a word here?" Yueying couldn't very well stand there stiffly, so she followed her gesture and sat down on the empty chair here. She was still smiling slightly, without uttering a word in reply. Jia Duocai also had considerable experience with matters of love and pleasure. But the people he had encountered were all people of that world, and they laughed and talked along with him. Now that he had encountered this girl from the countryside, who kept getting embarrassed, the situation became more and more awkward. As a result, he felt helpless. He put a cigarette in his mouth, put his hands behind his back, and paced back and forth in the room. He glanced at Yueying, constantly puffing out smoke. At this time, Yueying found the time to observe the room: the bedsheet on the opposite bed was the first thing that surprised her. The white background was as white as clouds, and the red flowers printed on it were as big as washbasins. Not to mention that, she looked closely for a long time but couldn't see any stitches on the bedsheet; it was a whole piece. Looking at the bottom of the bedsheet, it was very thick and substantial. She wondered how much cotton or felt was padded underneath. But looking at the quilt on top, there were three layers: the bottom layer was made of patterned silk, the middle layer was made of yellow silk, and the top layer was made of green silk. (89)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaozi</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaozi is from Jiangbei. He built two thatched sheds in the corner of our Jiading West City to shelter from the wind and rain. Speaking of which, his life is spent pulling a rickshaw. Well then, who would bother to look at such a lowly person? However, his name [Zhang Xiaozi] is really not easy to come by—because everyone knows him. He is Zhang Xiaozi, but in fact, among his fellow villagers, he is clearly called Zhang Xiaozhi. One day, I didn't quite understand, so I got the reason from a fruit seller. He is extremely filial to his old mother, so no one among his fellow villagers doesn't call him Zhang Xiaozhi. But the character [孝] (filial piety) sounds almost like the character [小] (small), so that many people don't quite understand that he is a very respectable and commendable person in modern society!</p>
<p>It is said that his old mother is already over sixty years old, her eyes are blind, and she is extremely frail. His wife, a certain woman, does laundry for others at home and is not like the women of poor families, but she is respectful and obedient. They only have one son, who is just four years old. His family, old and young, barely manage to make a living, relying solely on him and his wife, one using two legs and the other using two hands to survive. Alas! Unexpectedly, one day, Zhang broke his kneecap, and as a result, he could no longer pull the rickshaw. As a result, he couldn't continue to cook, and there was no way to start a fire. His wife, with only ten fingers left, could also think of nothing. Watching his old mother sitting on the bed, fainting many times because she hadn't had a bite to eat for several days, Zhang couldn't help but shed tears and secretly said to his wife: [My old mother's life is coming to an end, what should we do? His wife replied: [How can I bear to watch her? Now there is only one solution, I don't know if you will allow it? When asked, his wife said with tears in her eyes, [Alas! Rather than let our old mother linger and starve to death, leaving you with regrets for the rest of your life, why not sell this ignorant child to someone else, so that the grandson can prolong the grandmother's life? Isn't that a method of urgent rescue? So, the couple took their four-year-old son, got forty thousand cash, and sold him to a boatman of the same hometown outside the West Gate, as a temporary means of providing food and comfort. Later, Zhang's leg injury healed, and he continued to live by pulling the rickshaw. To this day, he still serves his old mother with utmost respect and reverence! Hey—Zhang Xiaozhi's name has since spread among the people of Jiangbei, but the character [孝] (filial piety) always sounds like the character [小] (small), so I recorded him as such. It can also be seen that the saying "In a village of ten households, there must be loyalty and trustworthiness, and within five steps, there must be fragrant grass" is indeed not an empty word.</p>
<h3>Bits and Pieces</h3>

<p>▲ It's strange, when lovers are face to face, they can't stop talking, especially in love letters after separation.</p>
<p>▲ In the summer, people envy the good of winter, and in the winter, they envy the good of summer. Only the propertied class doesn't have this contradictory thinking, especially the wealthy people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Records of the Fragrant Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although he never knew the heavy responsibilities that an emperor should bear, he did sit on the throne, so there was this small dragon robe.—The robe was made of yellow satin, and all around it, many flying dragons were embroidered with gold thread. The color was still very bright. When the Empress Dowager bent down, leaned over the box lid, and looked carefully, there seemed to be a light inside that reflected onto the Empress Dowager's face through the glass. For the sake of preserving her son's qualification to wear this dragon robe, not long after Xianfeng died, the Empress Dowager did take great risks and fight against the surrounding hostile environment. It was thanks to this fight that Her Old Highness was able to seize great power, look down upon the world, and become a rare female politician in history. Her original intention in fighting for the master of this small dragon robe eventually fulfilled herself. This undoubtedly amounts to failure!</p>
<p>We gathered around and carefully admired this yellow robe embroidered with golden dragons, and thus discovered that its collar was made of blue tribute satin, and there were several pearls the size of longans studded on it. Its magnificence was certainly extremely magnificent, but it was also very small! Judging from the size of this dragon robe, Tongzhi was indeed a very thin and weak child.</p>
<p>He seemed to have a special love for bronze objects. Therefore, many of them were collected here. Among them were a pair of small bronze drums, very exquisitely made. I think that if these drums were played by a skilled drummer, the beauty of their rhythm would be unmatched by any drum in the world. But their lives have also ended with their master. They will forever lie dormant in these ancient palaces without making a sound. (199)</p>
<h3>Weariness of Life</h3>
<p>— Yan BOGUANG</p>
<p>The trend of modern trends is to emphasize art in everything. Miss Wang, who lives across the street, graduated from a certain art school in Shanghai. Her parents cultivated her until she graduated from a specialized school, which can be considered fulfilling their responsibilities. Because her father only runs a small foreign grocery store, and supplying her with several thousand yuan of tuition and miscellaneous fees is already exhausting.</p>
<p>But Miss Wang, at the age of seventeen, began to advocate for celibacy in front of her parents. It turned out that from a young age, her parents had arranged an engagement for her with the Chen family. Now, she is dissatisfied with the Chen family having so much sinful money and raised a serious protest to her father, accusing him of why he sold her freedom and sovereignty to a monetary object. Can love be exchanged for money?</p>
<p>Alas! Her father is a small businessman, how can he be a match for her sharp tongue and cutting words? How could it not make her father shrink back?</p>
<p>But her father only knew how to roar and wave his fists. She finally succumbed to her father's strict authority and her mother's encouragement.</p>
<p>On a certain night not far from the wedding date, she committed suicide by taking poison! The suicide note only had the words [I am weary of life, goodbye!]. Her father was very saddened to see that she had committed suicide and regretted not having listened to her demands in the first place, leading to today!</p>
<p>However, the general public is still ridiculing her father, saying what a waste it was to have spent so much money, only to get an artistic euphemism for suicide! Weariness of life! But learned people still deeply regret her fate! She was only twenty-one years old this year.</p>

<h3>Song of Begging for Relief</h3>
<p>— (I am a Villager)</p>
<p>The abnormal development of the city reflects the decline of the countryside. The call for rural relief, despite its high-pitched singing, only sees rural funds becoming increasingly depleted; the unemployed in the countryside compete to squeeze into the city. There is the suffering of having no land to live on.</p>
<p>Du Gongbu is a great poet. But his wife and children can't avoid freezing and hunger. Modern writers, hiding in the city, in order to cater to the tastes of the upper classes, even songs directly speaking of the suffering of the people are rarely seen. I am a villager, and you discuss me learning a [fallen leaf cicada's song]:</p>
<p>[The city is fat, the countryside is thin;</p>
<p>The city is fragrant, the countryside is smelly;</p>
<p>The city is glamorous, the countryside is ugly;</p>
<p>The city has high buildings reaching the Milky Way; the countryside has ten houses, nine are dilapidated.</p>
<p>The city, the village women's clothes don't cover their elbows.</p>
<p>Those who complain in the city are abundant, who sees the countryside panting and complaining!</p>
<p>Better to be a city dog than a country person.</p>
<p>Alas, the call for rural relief rises into the clouds, but how much watery gruel has ever been had!)</p>
<p>Random Remarks</p>
<h3>Fishermen's Life on Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>— Ni Shanglong</p>
<p>Taihu Lake is a vast expanse of water in Jiangnan, spanning the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It covers an area of over eight hundred li. Although its waters do not produce monstrous waves, there are some treacherous conditions. However, the lake is very rich in aquatic products. Consequently, there are many people who make a living by fishing nets, spending all year floating and living on the lake.</p>
<p>There are about fifty or sixty large fishing boats in the lake, each capable of hoisting seven sails. They have no engines and rely entirely on wind power for propulsion. The size of the boats is comparable to merchant ships traveling on the Yangtze River. The value of each boat is approximately ten thousand yuan. They generally do not dock on the shore. If the people on board want to go ashore, they must use sampans to cross over. Most of these boat people are either relatives or members of the same clan, so they share common interests and can all stay in contact with each other. When fishing, two boats line up side by side, each with one end of the net attached, and they hoist their sails, allowing the force of the wind to propel them forward. The fish caught are divided equally between the two boats, and there are no disputes over who has worked harder or less.</p>
<p>For the boats, the entire year's planning hinges on winter. When the north wind howls fiercely, they all beam with smiles, sharing their joy. This is because fish are hatched in the spring and grow large by winter, and in the extreme cold, they become numb and unable to move, mostly clinging to the mud to keep warm. The boat people take advantage of this time to drag mud nets, which requires little effort, and with the force of the gale, they move quickly forward, sometimes covering two or three hundred li in a night, catching three or four thousand catties of fish or more per day. However, what they worry about most is that although Taihu Lake is wide, it is very shallow. Often, when there is too much wind and snow, the lake water suddenly freezes into ice. In that case, the production they have earnestly hoped for throughout the year will be in vain.</p>
<p>Because of the above, they have a very rich experience in predicting the weather, and some of their predictions are very accurate. For example, this summer was very hot. According to those who are experienced on the lake: [There will definitely be very cold weather in winter.] Other observations include that if the ninth day of the third lunar month is fixed, there will undoubtedly be severe cold. The quicksand in the lake wells up and almost becomes lake "cream" (lake water freezing, which boat people colloquially call "cream"). Therefore, when they are sailing in cold weather and see quicksand welling up in the lake and the water viscous like a paste, and feel the boat moving sluggishly, they dip a pole into the water and drain it. If the water droplets drip with difficulty, then they know that the lake is about to "cream" and quickly sail the boat to a sunny mountainside with food supplies, waiting for the spring breeze to thaw the ice. They also know when the ice will thaw, and on what day the east wind or southeast wind will blow. They have a thorough understanding of the changes in sunny weather, rain, and wind, but mostly they can only predict them without understanding the reasons.</p>
<p>Every man and woman on the fishing boats loves to drink wine. This is their most common habit. Therefore, they must drink when they go ashore, and drink as much as possible. Even on the sampans that are used to purchase grain and other supplies, a wine bag is an indispensable adornment. Women and men are quite the opposite. They are all diligent and frugal, with absolutely no such habit. In addition to satisfying their hunger, they also knit nets and sew clothes. Because of the environment, there is not a single woman who does not understand needlework. When it is the cold weather fishing season, they stay up all night, helping the men raise and lower the nets.</p>
<p>Marriages on the boats, except for a few who marry residents on land, are mostly between people of the same kind. When the boat people go ashore to visit relatives, they must bring some dried or fresh fish and shrimp to give to their relatives, but the relatives must also reciprocate with some other gifts. If they do not, they are considered to be looking down on them, and many break off relations because of this. When children get married, the parents of the bride and groom must give each other fifty or sixty catties of New Year cake at the end of the year. Therefore, families with many relatives often have to make more than five or six hundred catties of New Year cake. This is also a strange custom.</p>
<p>There is also education on the boats, but their textbooks are only a few copies of the "Hundred Family Surnames," "Three Character Classic," "Thousand Character Classic," "Prodigy Poems," and so on. The teaching method is the same as that of a private tutor, entirely individualized. The teacher is hired by a dozen or so boats, and their meals and lodging are provided. The cost is shared depending on the number of children from each boat. They treat the teacher with great respect. In addition to the three meals, they also provide snacks in the afternoon, which are exclusively for the teacher. Every two or three days, they hold a separate banquet to entertain the teacher. In addition, the students' families take care of the teacher's laundry, sewing, making the bed, folding the blankets, and cleaning the water pipe. The students take care of this, so the teacher does not have to worry about it. However, the tuition is very low, only fifty or sixty yuan per year.</p>
<p>The above information was all told to me by my old friend (a native of Dongshan, Taihu Lake), and I have written it down.</p>

<h3>Education News: Survey of Slave Education within the Territory of Dalian and Lushun</h3>
<p>▲ Dalian and Jinzhou Youths Deeply Influenced by Slave Education Spread Throughout [Manchukuo]</p>
<p>▲ These People Assist Tyranny, Northeastern Compatriots Suffer Even More</p>
<p>▲ Since the Incident, Japan Has Urgently Sought to Popularize Slave Education in Dalian and Lushun</p>
<p>(Northeast News Agency, Dalian) Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have run rampant in the Northeast, and many youths from Dalian, Jinzhou, and other places, who have been influenced by slave education, have greatly assisted them. Many of those who serve as translators for the Japanese army and as lackeys for the puppet officials are graduates of schools in Dalian and Jinzhou. Although it is hateful that Chinese people are acting as accomplices for the Japanese invaders, who are ravaging and trampling on our compatriots, it is evident that slave education has deeply penetrated people's hearts. Now that the Northeast is entirely under slave education, the future is even more unimaginable. Recently, the Japanese have invested heavily in establishing so-called secondary schools, public schools, and ordinary schools in the cities and villages of Lushun, Dalian, Jinzhou, Pulandian, and Bizigao within [Kwantung Leased Territory], specifically to enroll Northeastern youths and instill slave education in them. According to Japanese data, the schools currently established in these five districts include three secondary schools: Lushun Higher Public School, Dalian Commercial School, and Jinzhou Agricultural School; eleven public schools in the five districts of Lushun, Dalian, Jinzhou, Pulandian, and Bizigao; and a total of one hundred and fourteen ordinary schools.

<h3>National Labor Exhibition: Judging of Results Begins</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th) The judging of the National Labor Exhibition began on the 13th, divided into three categories: A, B, and C. It is scheduled to end on the 15th. The Ministry of Education hosted a banquet for all the judges on the evening of the 13th.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Foundation Donates Lectureship to National Central University</h3>
<p>▲ Dr. Stuart Loring, PhD in Physics, Arrives in Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 3rd) The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee has donated a lectureship to National Central University. President Luo and the London China Universities Committee have agreed to hire Dr. Stuart Loring, a PhD in Physics from Cambridge University, England, and currently a professor at the University of Liverpool, England. Cambridge University is a world-renowned center for physics, and the awarding of its PhD degree is extremely cautious. The University of Liverpool is also a university in England known for its science. This selection is extremely appropriate. It is also reported that Dr. Stuart will arrive in Nanjing around January 20th. After that, the university's College of Science should have even more colorful clouds.</p>
<h3>Selection of Exhibits for Chinese Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>The International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London is scheduled to open in London in November next year. The Chinese exhibits have been selected and appraised by a preparatory committee of the exhibition, which has invited experts Yang Zhensheng, Ye Gongchuo, and more than ten others to participate. The main parts of the exhibits are calligraphy, painting, bronze, and porcelain. It is reported that in terms of calligraphy and painting, more than 300 pieces have been selected, ranging from the Qianlong and Kangxi periods of the former Qing Dynasty to the Five Dynasties and Song Dynasty. In terms of porcelain, more than 300 pieces have also been selected from the Qing Dynasty and earlier. However, due to standards, only more than 180 pieces of bronze ware from the Three Dynasties have been selected. A preliminary exhibition is planned to be held in Shanghai in March of next spring. At that time, foreigners will be invited to offer opinions and request modifications. As long as China does not experience any difficulties or cause the exhibits to be difficult to transport and display, temporary adjustments can be made. After participating in the London exhibition, when the exhibits return to China, they will be exhibited again in Nanjing.</p>

<p>Requests Allocation of Sponsorship Funds</p>
<p>The Chinese College at the University of Frankfurt, Germany, was founded by Professor Richard Wilhelm, who once taught at Peking University. Countess Graefin Sierstorpff of Germany donated to help establish it. Wilhelm was a specialist in Chinese Confucianism and translated the Four Books and Five Classics, as well as the books of Lao Tzu, Zhuangzi, Mozi, and Liezi, introducing many Chinese philosophies to Europeans for study. After the European War, when Germany's economy was in difficulty, Wilhelm painstakingly maintained the Chinese College, which was not affected. Wilhelm died the year before last, and the successor Director is D. Rousselle. The Vice Director is Ding Wenjiang's younger brother, Mr. Ding Wenyuan, who consulted with our country's envoy Jiang Zuobin. Upon proposal by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the central government and its passing, China would sponsor 80,000 marks annually as the Chinese Lecture Fund for the University of Frankfurt. However, due to financial difficulties, it was subsequently resolved that the Ministry of Finance would allocate 40,000 yuan. The Ministry of Education, on the other hand, was already allocating 5,000 yuan annually to the college for publishing the journal "Sinica." Now, the subsidy for the journal has been allocated during Minister Wang Shijie's term, but the 40,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance has not yet been remitted. The Vice Director of the college, Ding Wenyuan, came to China specifically for this matter. He arrived at the Ministry of Education at 4:00 PM on the 12th and consulted with Department Chief Qiu and Section Chief Zheng to request the allocation of funds. It was mentioned that the college is now planning to establish a Chinese Culture Museum and that it has been in contact with intermediaries in Shanghai. Several thousand yuan has already been donated, and there have also been donations for the museum, which will be established soon. It is hoped that the 40,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance will be allocated quickly to facilitate the progress of the Chinese lecture project. He is currently consulting with the Ministry of Finance on the remittance. He also said that the college has a board of directors, whose chairman is the envoy to China, Bu Liangxi.</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Institute Sends Letters to Schools Nationwide to Investigate Agriculture, Forestry, and Economics</h3>
<p>Fill Out Survey Forms and Receive a Free Subscription to the "Current Affairs Monthly"</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Facts and Avoid Misleading Information When Conducting Surveys</p>
<p>The Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Institute sent letters to schools nationwide yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that, for the purpose of studying agricultural, forestry, and economic issues in our country, our institute has formulated a survey form on the population density of rural forests and land utilization. We have sent letters to various schools recommended by the county governments or education bureaus to fill out the forms. We are grateful for the enthusiastic support of teachers and staff from various schools. Many schools have already filled out the survey forms, but a small number of schools have not yet filled them out, presumably because the survey forms did not reach them. According to statistical principles, the more locations surveyed, the closer the results are to the truth. Our institute wants the results to be as close to the truth as possible, so we are sending another copy each of the survey forms on the population density of rural forests and land utilization, the second survey form on the tenancy system, and the survey form on the food problem, along with postage stamps for returning them. Please distribute and fill out the survey forms and return them to our institute. Once we receive the filled out survey forms, we will send you a free one-month subscription to the 'Current Affairs Monthly.' If you are willing to continue working as a correspondent for our institute, we will gradually send you subscriptions to the 'Current Affairs Monthly' or other publications after our review and approval. If there are no teachers or staff at your school who are familiar with rural conditions, please forward the forms to enthusiastic individuals in the local rural areas who are dedicated to public service to fill them out. All the questions in the survey forms are simple, and anyone familiar with agricultural and forestry conditions can report them. However, if you are not careful when filling them out, it is easy to stray too far from the truth. Therefore, we would like to ask you to pay attention to the actual facts when filling them out. Please take note of this and handle accordingly. We would be very grateful."</p>

Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Improving Comic Books: The society, recognizing that the comic books and novels popular on the market either promote myths and monsters or are indecent and unsuitable, which has a detrimental impact on readers, has not only requested the Education Bureau to review, burn, or prohibit their publication, but has also actively compiled improved comic books to supplement them. It is reported that the first collection, compiled by Mr. Qiu Jiyin, is entitled "Sister-in-Law Wang," which promotes the literacy movement and is full of social education significance. It is currently in print, and many other improved comics, such as "The Story of Yue Fei," are being compiled.</p>
<p>Holding a Book and Painting Exhibition: In order to encourage members' interest in books and paintings, the society has collected members' works to hold a book and painting exhibition. It is scheduled to open on New Year's Day at the Citizens' Education Center. Pan Gongzhan, Ding Nianxian, Chen Songchun, Ma Gongyu, Qian Shoutie, Zhang Rongsun, Xie Xianou, Gu Kunbo, Shi Chongpeng, Tang Rongkai, Zhao Limin, Yang Changnian, and others have all sent works to the exhibition. It is said that the price of each work is ten yuan, and the proceeds will be used to fund the improvement of comic books.</p>

<h3>Liangjiang Wins Three Out of Three Matches in Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ A Fierce Battle Against the Wuxi Lingling Team</p>
<p>▲ Lingling Suffers a Crushing Defeat Due to Disparity in Strength</p>
<p>(Wuxi Letter) The Shanghai Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team, renowned for its agility and skill in nine battles, recently embarked on a tour of various cities along the Jinghu Line. After achieving great success in Suzhou some days ago, they came to Wuxi yesterday to challenge. At 9:30 AM, they first faced the Jiangnan Women's Middle School basketball team, but Jiangnan was no match for them. The result was 58 to 2, with Jiangnan suffering a crushing defeat. At 2:30 PM, Liangjiang challenged the Jingzhi Women's Middle School, with Liangjiang winning with its brave fighting spirit. Jingzhi was also defeated miserably, with a score of 82 to 10, Liangjiang winning by a large margin. At 3:30 PM, Liangjiang, with the momentum of two consecutive victories, faced the Lingling team, composed of physical education teachers from various women's schools in Wuxi. Shen Jizhi, the director of the Public Sports Field, served as the referee. The Liangjiang team attacked from all sides, while the Lingling team tried their best to resist. The situation was extremely tense, with the score changing rapidly. However, the Lingling team only had six players, with no new reinforcements, while Liangjiang had eighteen players who rotated frequently. Therefore, the strength of the two sides was unequal. In the end, the Lingling team was exhausted and had to surrender. As a result, Liangjiang still won by a large margin, with a score of 38.</p>

<h3>The Faithfulness and Elegance of Translation</h3>
<p>— Shuang Jie</p>
<p>The famous modern Italian aesthetician, Croce (B. Croce), said in his book on aesthetics: [What has been created in a beautiful form, we can re-express it in a logical form, but what already has a beautiful form cannot be changed into another form that is also beautiful. The result of translation is either a reduction and damage to the original expression, or putting the original expression into a melting pot and mixing it with the translator's own impressions, creating a new expression... The saying "a faithful ugly woman or an unfaithful beauty" perfectly illustrates the dilemma of every translator.] What he means is that if we are not satisfied with simply interpreting the original text when translating, but further demand an expression that is as beautiful as the original, we will find ourselves in a dilemma. This view, to anyone who has had even a little translation experience, will not find it an exaggeration. The creation and development of a nation's language and writing is determined by its most fundamental economic life. If the economic nature is different, the national psychology and the cultural state that reflects this psychology will naturally have different appearances. It is already not easy to understand the art of another country, let alone express it with aesthetic words [appropriately]!</p>
<p>When an author is in the midst of a strong artistic impulse, the value of that beauty is complete. When that impulse forms a clear concept in the brain, that value is reduced by one point. When the concept is translated into formed words and entrusted to the arm and written out, that value is reduced by another point, but that is only its original appearance. When a translator from another country uses a mind cultivated in different living habits to understand it, experience it, and then express it in another language through language and obscurity, it is already very far from the original author's intention. If the translator has a deep understanding of the original author's temperament, living environment, and the language they use, and can freely use their own language, this can still give the reader a glimpse of the rough outline of the original work, otherwise it will be a hundred thousand miles away from the original. Moreover, a word does not exist in isolation. Hidden behind the word is the entire vertical history and horizontal range of that nation. What is the connotation of a certain word in the vocabulary of that country, and what kind of associations does it evoke in people's minds? All of these must be given a clear analysis. From this point of view, the work of translation, even if it is not as impossible as Croce says, is at least very laborious, very difficult, and should be approached with caution.</p>
<p>The French critic Guyau said: [The ideal straight line is the shortest distance from one point to another, and the ideal style is also the shortest distance from one person's mood to another person's mood.] Starting from this mathematical and mechanical concept, Spencer said that language is a machine for people to communicate with each other. Finding a word's position properly to evoke the reader's mood is a matter of using intuition and perception to evoke or guide attention and association. This is also true in translation. Constantly dissolving, refining, and embellishing, to seek a forced resemblance between two languages, reducing the distance between them to the smallest possible limit, is the responsibility of the translator, and when he has done so, he has perfectly completed his task.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the special translation issue of literary magazines, there have been two publications, Translation and Folk Literature, that specialize in introducing foreign literature. In the sense of [attacking flaws with the help of others], translated works from abroad are only considered too few, not too many. However, what we require is good translation. Even if we cannot have someone like Aylmer Maude who accompanied Tolstoy in Russia for many years before starting to translate his works, we still cannot take this work too lightly, hoping to introduce foreign works by holding a pen in one hand and flipping through a dictionary in the other. Our requirements for current translators can be written in a long essay if we say too much, but in short, it is just a little hope that the translation is [on the one hand, faithful to the original author, and on the other hand, fluent for the reader.]</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Sitting in the train, feeling bored, occasionally looking out the window: Under the azure sky is a vast expanse of fields, ancient farmhouses, half-hidden in the verdant woods, with only a hazy cloud of smoke at the horizon, shrouded with a few faint distant trees.</p>
<p>This vast territory of Annam is enough for the train to run. I got up at six o'clock in the morning, and I've been traveling continuously, but the destination is still far away.</p>
<p>The weather is particularly hot. We who grew up in temperate regions find this climate exceptionally difficult to bear. In addition, the unpleasant, miasmic smell I encountered in Haiphong constantly follows and attacks me, causing a bit of a headache.</p>
<p>Almost all of the passengers on the train are Annamese people with teeth dyed jet black, chewing mouthfuls of bright red betel nut. Among these people, there are a few aristocrats wearing short black gauze robes, white cloth pants, a gauze turban wrapped around their heads, and only a pair of wooden shoes on their feet, without socks. Apart from these few people, most of them are poorly dressed, coffee-colored gowns, unkempt, and unclean working class people.</p>
<p>These laborers who have come out of the countryside carry all sorts of agricultural products they have worked hard to obtain, sitting crowded and noisy on the train, probably taking things to the city to sell? They look so excited, some even put their feet on the seats, chattering and conversing with their companions, making the train very lively.</p>
<p>Burying my head, feeling quite bored, I leaned on the train window, and my heart couldn't help but think of my father far away in the heavens, my old and helpless father. At this time, he might be gripping a hoe and digging the ground... But how could he have thought that at this moment, his son, whom he was eagerly hoping would come to help him, would quietly leave him? And, this is a departure with not a penny to be had...</p>
<p>As I thought silently, my heart couldn't help but feel a little heavy, but it was immediately encouraged by the vague hope for the future, and I felt somewhat relieved again.</p>
<p>It was already late, and I don't know when many of the passengers had gotten off the train, leaving only a few in the car. Dusk brought a cool river breeze, and in the dim twilight, the majestic buildings of Tokyo could already be seen dimly. A twilight haze like cooking smoke permeated the surroundings, the train gave two long whistles, and then rumbled onto that iron bridge that shone with the civilization of the twentieth century, about eight or nine miles long, spanning the Red River and the Clear River.</p>
<p>This bridge is about four zhang wide. Cars can pass on both sides of the tracks. Under the bridge is the rushing river water, and many wooden rafts float on the river, reflecting the bright electric lights of Tokyo. The scenery on this river is particularly beautiful!</p>
<p>Sitting on the train, it took about ten or twenty minutes to cross the bridge. The bridge leads directly to Tokyo Station. After the train crossed the Red River and the Clear River, it passed over many houses in Tokyo. Looking out the window, the houses below the bridge were so low that they were almost hidden under the train.</p>
<p>When the train arrived in Tokyo, it was already the time when the lights were coming on. The stores on both sides of the road displayed dazzling goods, and cars roared on the smooth asphalt road, speeding past like lightning. Needless to say, this emerging colonial city is like other modern metropolises.</p>
<p>Carrying my luggage out of the train, I went to a store opened by a Cantonese person, where I had a meal, and then hurriedly jumped back onto the car.</p>
<p>At this time, it was already past nine o'clock at night. In this night where only the river breeze was whistling, carrying a heart of reluctant farewell, I parted ways with Tokyo!</p>
<h3>On the Relationship Between Works and Life</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuying</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Lin Huanping, Mr. Wu Liping, and Mr. Meng Jia have successively discussed the issue of writers' real lives. Mr. Lin advocates that writers should have [rich] [life experiences]. Mr. Wu says that [writers are by no means created, they are only people who actually live, and their works are only direct life experiences. They do not live in order to produce great works]. Mr. Meng supports the former and opposes the latter. I would like to say a few points on this issue, and if the debate does not stop here, it may be good for everyone to use as a reference.</p>
<p>First, literature is ultimately a discipline centered on emotion. It was not until the emergence of modern and progressive literature that the element of thought was added, and then emotion and thought were given equal importance. However, no matter how much the thought in literature is elevated, the expression of emotion and thought in literature still relies on [imagination]. Imagination constitutes the substance of literature, and it expresses fervent emotion – emotion that passes through a certain thought. Since the substance of literature is constituted by imagination, imagination only has the distinction between deep and mellow and superficial and poor, and there is absolutely no distinction between abundant or not abundant life. Homer's poems, Tolstoy's novels, it would probably be an unreasonable request to ask them to taste the life depicted in their works before engaging in creation.</p>
<p>Second, perhaps many of Balzac's and Gorky's works are [records of their actual lives lived through]. But there are many actual lives of poverty, wandering, and labor like those of Balzac and Gorky in the world. Why is it that only Balzac and Gorky were able to write works? Also, people like Ye Shaojun, Mao Dun, and Zhang Tianyi in China are by no means absolutely failed writers. Should all of their works be records of actual life? At the same time, if Balzac and Gorky used their strong artistic ability of imagination to depict other stories, such as Sinclair's depiction of the destruction of an oil tycoon, and the misery of coal mines and slaughterhouses, wouldn't this have the same value as a record of private life?</p>
<p>Third, literature is a substance constituted by artistic imagination. The constitution of this imagination does not necessarily have to be limited to the scope of personal actual life, but it is not difficult for imagination to depart from the general life of reality. If a writer writes a work with a certain purpose, and does not have such an experience in his own actual life, he must imagine social matters in a pavilion or a western-style building. A person with strong imagination can write a work that seems to have actually happened, but a person with immature imagination can only say stupidly and untruthfully, and the work completely loses its authenticity. Therefore, I believe that the success or failure of a work is entirely a matter of the writer's ability. Although a writer with weak ability may find it easier to succeed in describing stories that he has experienced, this is the writer's trick and cannot generalize the whole of literature.</p>
<h3>From History to Astronomy</h3>
<p>— Prism</p>
<p>Recently, astronomy has gradually attracted attention. The only relatively complete existing book on astronomy is often mentioned; the terminology of astronomy compiled by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation has even appeared before the terminology of physics; a illustrated book about constellations has also appeared; over a dozen books on astronomy are planned to be included in the second collection of the Wan Qian Library. Individual bookstores have also printed some works on the physics of the universe, the mysterious universe, and pilgrimages to the starry sky, etc.</p>
<p>I myself am also very happy to be reading astronomy books, which naturally brings me joy. In the past, when looking for astronomy books, I felt a bit of distress. I couldn't find many astronomy books in the few libraries I could go to. I wanted to buy them myself, but I never had enough money, and some were terribly expensive. For example, the original version of "Pilgrimage to the Starry Sky," a thin book of just over ninety pages, cost four and a half yuan. Moreover, when I occasionally had some spare money, the bookstore might not have the books I wanted, such as the astronomical almanac. Since the cessation of publication of the Chinese Astronomical Almanac in 1933, I had to buy the English-language "Nautical Almanac" that year, and the Japanese Astronomical Almanac in another year. A few days ago, when I went to buy the astronomical almanac, the new ones hadn't arrived yet, but I happened to see the British abridged "Nautical Almanac" in a nautical supply store, so I bought it to read.</p>
<p>The nautical almanac is practical, so it naturally omits some things that can be considered unimportant. For example, the section on planetary movements only mentions Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, but not Mercury, Uranus, or Neptune. This reminded me of someone's opinion that Uranus and Neptune are irrelevant to society. I believe that opinion, although if there were a book specifically about Uranus and Neptune, I would very much like to read it, but that is just a personal preference.</p>
<p>However, I must state that this preference is not for the sake of increasing astronomical knowledge. My occasional exposure to this field has not made me so foolish as to think that I can specialize in Uranus and Neptune. However, I know that Lowell spent his life studying Mars, and although he was very specialized, the books he wrote were quite sufficient to provide material for strange discussions, and everyone was quite happy to know a little bit. In the past two years, it seems that Jupiter, rather than Mars, has attracted more attention. According to the opinions of those who believe in the "two stars meet" theory, Jupiter is the key to the formation of the solar system. The history of the sun may be recorded on planets beyond Saturn, so perhaps Uranus and Neptune will one day become a common topic for ordinary people.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Laplace's nebular hypothesis was still widely believed. I also read a small booklet called "From Nebula to Mankind" and seemed to have gained some understanding. But now, the contradictions between astronomy and geography implicit in this kind of theory that connects astronomy and geography have finally been discovered. The age of the sun's formation measured by the nebular hypothesis is not sufficient for the formation of the earth, let alone the development of life on earth.</p>
<p>Recent historians no longer confine themselves to historical facts after the existence of language and writing, but extend the timeline, some even starting from protozoa. If this is said to be the progress of history, this progress depends on the progress of other sciences as a foundation. The study of ancient societies requires the study of anthropology to have some direction, and anthropology itself has many questions that are geological questions, which lead to the entire problem of the earth, and earth science is only a branch of astronomy. Just from the fact that astronomy has not yet been able to determine the age of the earth, the extension of the historical timeline can only reach a certain limit, and even within this limit, there are not necessarily no problems.</p>
<p>It is natural for humans to place themselves at the center of everything, but this has given great obstacles to the theory of evolution in the past, and even now ordinary schools are unwilling to broaden the boundaries of history. However, those who know the importance of evolution to history may think it absurd to drag history into astronomy. But I believe that under the topic "From Nebula to Mankind," there will always be new and good books appearing.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (10)(6)</h3>
<p>— Written by (Joseph Conrad), translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>Her headscarf fell to the ground, and he bent down to pick it up; she was gone. He wrapped it around his arm and walked boldly towards the window. He saw a burly fat man sitting in an armchair, an unshaded lamp, and a large, flat face with shaggy hair all around, with a wide mouth yawning; he also saw Miss Bessan's head and upper body. The yelling had stopped; the blind man had achieved his goal. He thought that everything was unsatisfactory, and his heart was extremely chaotic. His father was crazy; he couldn't go into the house. He had no money to go back, and a hungry partner left in London might be starting to think that he had been deliberately ignored. ["Damn it,"] he murmured. Of course, he could open the door and go in; but they might tie him up so tightly that he couldn't breathe just because he didn't ask; this was not a big deal, but he was extremely afraid of being locked up, even by mistake. He felt cold all over as he thought of this place, and he stomped heavily on the wet grass.</p>
<p>["What are you doing? -- A sailor?"] An excited voice said.</p>
<p>She had run out, and it was just a black shadow, a shadow attracted by the reckless shadow waiting for her at her window. ["Anything. My talents are not limited to being a sailor on a ship. This time, I came home that way."]</p>
<p>["Where did you come back from?"] she asked.</p>
<p>["After a happy banquet,"] he said, ["coming on the London train -- do you know? Huh? I hate being closed in a train. I don't feel so bad about a house."]</p>
<p>["Ah,"] she said, ["that's lucky."]</p>
<p>["Because in a house, you can open that damn door at any time and run onto the road in front of you."]</p>
<p>["From now on, won't you come back?"]</p>
<p>["At least not for sixteen years,"] he laughed. ["To this rabbit hole, eating a bad shovel..."]</p>
<p>["A ship isn't that big either."] she said sarcastically.</p>
<p>["No, but the sea is big."]</p>
<p>She lowered her head, as if her ears were drawn to the sound of the world, and she heard the tide stirred up by yesterday's sea breeze beyond the seawall, slapping the shore, making a monotonous, solemn vibration, as if the whole earth had become a funeral bell.</p>
<p>["Hey, that's what they call a ship a ship. You love her, you leave; a sea voyage isn't a marriage."] He quoted a sailor's proverb so nonchalantly.</p>
<p>["That's not a marriage,"] she whispered.</p>
<p>["What is your purpose in coming here?"] she asked fearfully.</p>
<p>["Five pounds,"] he replied immediately. ["We enjoyed ourselves a little too much and got into some trouble."]</p>
<p>["Have you been drinking all the time?"] she asked.</p>
<p>["Drunk for three days; deliberately so. I am not addicted to alcohol -- don't get me wrong. Nothing, and no one, can subdue me unless I want to. I can be as firm as a rock. My partner saw the newspaper this morning, and he said to me: [Go ahead, Harry: love your father. You can definitely get five pounds]. So we scraped together the fare from everyone's pockets. A cursed mockery."]</p>

<h3>Finance Supply and Demand are on a Balanced Line</h3>
<p>Gold Price Shows No Significant Fluctuations</p>
<p>Slight Increase and Slight Decrease...Return Hanging Two Jiao</p>
<p>Since the gold market rebounded the day before yesterday, the situation has been stable. The market initially rose and then fell yesterday. Although the result was a slight decrease, the day's market conditions were very mediocre, and sentiment was very stable. Supply and demand are balanced, lacking special risks. The morning opening showed that both British and American silver markets were shrinking overseas, and the forward silver price was flat. However, large-scale capital was relatively strong, exchange rates slightly contracted, and London spot gold rose by half a penny. Pre-market trading opened outside the exchange, immediately rising to 71.2 yuan. Sentiment was quite stable. Subsequently, the Central Bank's listing was announced, with both British and American rates remaining flat, and the customs gold unit rose by one li. The standard gold price was listed at 1003.5 yuan and continued to rise. The morning opening was high, and the situation was stable after the opening, hovering around 2 yuan. Then, the bank's support for the shilling caused buying to rise in the market, leading to an increase. Knowing that HSBC's British and American exchange rates would not change, supply became abundant, and the market was downstream. Banks heavily sold US dollars, and sellers showed strength, once approaching the 70 yuan mark. However, because the Central Bank supported the shilling, the price fell but recovered. The silver balance tax was announced unchanged, still levied at 6.75%. The British exchange rate, calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 59375, was even flatter, fluctuating between 1 and 2 yuan, but the trend was easier to pull up. Therefore, buying activity slightly increased after entering the market, and the upward trend resumed, causing the 10 yuan line to turn around. However, many people took the opportunity to sell, and banks continued to sell US dollars, suddenly reviving the buying sentiment. The price fell immediately after rising, but the overall trend was still fluctuating at noon. The market continued to be stable in the afternoon, and trading was normal, with a sluggish market for quite some time. Until the first report from Mumbai showed a decrease of 4.4.4 anna, the market price rose, but the selling sentiment followed. Banks slightly sold US dollars, and sellers took advantage of the situation to become active, gradually moving downstream. When the 70 yuan mark was broken, many long positions rushed to sell, and large accounts also cut their losses. Sentiment was uneasy, leading to a decline. However, because the exchange market was normal and the second report from Mumbai showed no change, buyers repeatedly became active at low prices, and silver bars were also digested, gradually rising back to over 7 yuan. However, the upward momentum was only temporary, and large accounts still closed positions. The market finally succumbed within the 70 yuan mark, which was due to the swap relationship, and many long positions dared not linger. The current swap period coincides with Saturday, starting early at 10 am. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 972.7 yuan, an increase of 2.7 yuan compared to the previous close. The situation was ambiguous at the beginning, but due to Shunmao, Richang, and Wanxing selling bars, the price retreated from 3 yuan to 1.5 yuan. Hengyu, Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng accepted bars, rising to 2.5 yuan. Shenkang and Fuyu sold, retreating again to 1.4 yuan. At this time, Zhengjin was selling spot shillings at 9375, while HSBC and Citibank were supporting, stabilizing sentiment. Dadecheng, Fuxing, Yongzhaofeng, Changyongfeng, Yuanchang, and Yongfu'an accepted bars at low prices, gradually rising to 4 yuan. Knowing that HSBC's British and American exchange rates would not change, Fuxing, Yongdingkang sold, dropping to 2.5 yuan. Huabi supported February shillings at 4375, and Dadecheng and Futaiheng still had buying interest, gradually rising to 3.5 yuan. Soon, Shanghai and others came out with February US dollars at 875, and Sassoon also had selling interest. Fuxing, Yongda, Dadecheng, Dingkang, Qingyu, etc. sold, falling to 0.1 yuan. The Central Bank supported January shillings at 625. Dadecheng and Fuxingyong maintained at low prices, gradually rising. The silver balance tax was announced unchanged. After this, the price once rose back to over 2 yuan. Shanghai came out with February US dollars at 875, and Hengyu supplied bars, falling again to 1 yuan. After entering the market, sentiment gradually strengthened. Fuyu, Dingkang, Juchang, Hengxingyuan, Yongli, etc. rushed to enter bars, rising to 4.5 yuan. Changda and Dalian Gang took the opportunity to sell bars at high prices, dropping to 3.3 yuan. However, Juchang, Fuxing, and Yuanyi continued to accept, and the price later rose to 4.5 yuan. Zhaofeng, Changda, Dalian Gang, Hengxingchang, Dada Xingyong, etc. successively sold off, and banks continued to sell US dollars. Sassoon sold light shillings, gradually moving downstream. Later, Tianfeng sold heavily, dropping to 1.2 yuan. Huixiang and Hongxing maintained at low prices, and Yuanmao Yong also came to buy, stabilizing the situation. The price then rose back to 2.2 yuan. The noon closing was 972.1 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 972.2 yuan. Hengxing, Qianchang, Xiangfu, Fuyu, etc. accepted bars, and the situation was stable. Youli supported February shillings at 4375. However, because there were very few transactions, the situation was sluggish, and the range was also small. Until Mumbai's first report announced a decrease of 4.4 anna, the price rose to 2.9 yuan. Wanxing, Renfa, Yongyuankang, Xiangfu, Xingyuanyi, Fuxingyong, Yuanmao, Yongzhentai, Zhaofengchang, etc. continuously sold bars. Korea came out with January US dollars at 25, gradually moving downstream. After the 70 yuan mark was broken, the long side stirred again, falling to 68 yuan. Qingyu, Hengyu, Tianfeng, and Hu heavily accepted bars at low prices. Mumbai's second report telegraphed no change, rising to 9.7 yuan. Zhaofengchang and Yuanmaoyong sold again, retreating to 8 yuan. Yuqingyong, Hengyiyifeng, Yongding, Taichun, and Yuanyong all rushed to buy in, gradually rising back to 70.6 yuan, Yongli at 8 jiao. Fuyu, Zhengchang, etc. came to buy in, maintaining the price and rising to 70 yuan. After hovering, the closing was 969.8 yuan. After the market closed, Hengxing, Fuxingyong, etc. accepted bars, and the situation stabilized, rising back to above 70 yuan. The highest price of the day was 974.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 968 yuan, with a fluctuation of 6.5 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 2 jiao lower than the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was listed by the Central Bank's gold price as 1003.5 yuan, approximately 33 yuan higher than the closing price, an increase of half a yuan compared to the previous close. The January account price was 972 yuan, with a morning water supplement of 963 yuan and an afternoon water supplement of 961 yuan. The red gold price was still 1 yuan lower than the futures price, at 971.7 yuan. The spot market was still quiet, with a higher water supplement. Generally, Tianjin goods were about 1 yuan higher than the futures price, but there were no transactions, and the trend was extremely bleak.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre. In summary, Zhaofengchang, Yuanyi, Yongli, Shunmao, Yuanmao Yong, Xianghe, Yuqingyong, Fuchang, Fuxingyong, Changda, Dafen, Daxingyong, Tianfeng, Tongyi, Tongchun, Runchang, Rongkang, Renfa, etc. were on the selling side. Fuyu, Juchang, Dachang, Xiangfu, Taiheng, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Yongfeng, Yuxinxiang, Tongfu, Yuanchang, Yong Hongxing, Hengxing, etc. were on the buying side. Fuxing and Fu'an advanced and then exited, while Hengxing Qingyu and Dingtai exited and then entered. Dalian Gang and Wanxing did a total of over 600 bars, netting over 200 bars. Shunli did a total of over 300 bars, netting a slight exit. Guang Gang Shengda was calm, and Hengxing slightly netted. The total number of transactions for the day was 30,205 bars in the morning and 15,547 bars in the afternoon. There were 28,231 January chips, with a total of 61 long positions and 56 short positions.</p>

Compared with the previous close, the British and American rates were flat. After the opening, the Central Bank's listing was announced, with both British and American rates remaining flat, and the customs gold unit rose by one li. The market situation was quite stable, and banks had a strong buying interest, with frequent transactions and a tight process. HSBC's British and American exchange rate listings were announced unchanged, and banks slightly sold US dollars. However, because the central government was still accepting shillings, the silver balance tax was announced unchanged, still levied at 6.75%. The British exchange rate, calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 59375, was still mediocre. After this, although Sassoon sold shillings, it was difficult to change the overall situation, with a slight tilt and a potentially tight situation. However, the expensive bank sold US exchange again, and the market was extremely stable in the afternoon. There were not many transactions. The first report from India Silver announced a decrease of 4 anna. After entering the market, the psychology of Chinese merchants suddenly weakened, and they came to supply in droves. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy, and the first report from India Silver announced no change. The process remained flat. Near the close, the recent selling prices were the British exchange rate at 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 875, and the US exchange rate at 34.8125 yuan.

The foreign interbank rate was 2 jiao and 3 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, also the same as the day before.

<h3>Auxiliary Currency Fluctuates in a Small Range</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars once fell by 5 jiao in the morning market, making 837.5 yuan. The situation in the afternoon market tightened, and transactions were booming, adding a good 2.5 yuan, to 840 yuan. Therefore, the result was still an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were made: 3,000 jiao in the morning market and 7,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were still 752.3 yuan in the morning market and changed to 752 yuan in the afternoon market. The result was only 3 jiao lower than the previous day.

<h3>Securities Bond Market in Extreme Stagnation</h3>
<p>｜Continuing a Small Fraction of Five Cents, One Dime to Three Dimes｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, foreign exchange rates, and market prices remained almost unchanged. The stagnation was unprecedented, and most people were watching. Although those who are bullish recently feel it's a good deal, the money supply is ultimately a factor. For forward contracts, the market price is too high, and the spread is excessive. Although money is tight, it shouldn't affect the fundamentals of the bond market. The environment is good, the country is united, and there are many rescue methods being considered. The financial sector prefers shorting sterling to public bonds, which is also a business strategy, choosing to act for profit. Therefore, although the near and far terms are distorted, it is a temporary phenomenon. Before long, domestic cash will return, and it should not be difficult to gradually return to normal. Although it is unknown whether the large short positions in the market will cover their positions, retail investors' arbitrage trading has gradually picked up. Market prices may have a round of recovery. Because the accumulation of weakness has been going on for a long time, the highest price for the current June contract is already down a little over four yuan. A slight movement in trading can easily trigger short covering and new long positions. Yesterday, only the opening session in the morning saw a relatively large sell-off of contract number 38, and the market price remained sluggish, down a small two or three dimes. The second session and the opening and closing sessions in the afternoon immediately entered a state of abnormal stagnation. Prices rose and fell differently, with great discrepancies, or even no change at all. The high and low differences were only five cents to one or two dimes. Observing the trading floor, large short positions often took the opportunity to exert pressure, as if fearing a rise in market prices. Judging from the situation, their short positions may also be floating and unsubstantial. We shall see what happens later. The result of the day's market prices was a continuation of a small fraction of five cents, one dime to three dimes. The total turnover was 12,621,100 yuan, plus 25 shares of stock. The results of the increases and decreases are listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Has Turned Stable</h3>
<p>Report from Sinfeng Foreign Firm: Yesterday (12th), the New York stock market trend turned stable, but the atmosphere was abnormally dull. Traders said that yesterday's decline was due to profit-taking by bulls, and the decline triggered limit orders. However, there were no insufficient funds in the accounts of today's traders, and there were very few margin calls. Russ Films was actively traded, and the price has stabilized slightly. Although the Steel Age magazine's estimate of steel workload showed an increase, steel stocks were still slightly lower. Railway stocks showed mixed gains and losses. Other sectors generally rose by a few dimes. The bond market stabilized. Small exchange stocks were uneven. Chicago wheat was dragged down by corn. The fall in corn was due to the weakness of the Argentine market, it was said. The total trading volume for the day was 790,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>Eleven Days Twelve Days Increase/Decrease</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Flower - Yarn and Cotton Flower Under a Calm Market Situation</h3>
<p>The yarn market is increasingly gloomy. Tongcheng Company remains unchanged. New sellers are also lacking. Both bullish and bearish sides are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, there are very few transactions, and the market is very calm. There were many short sales in the morning market, which shows that people are scattered.</p>
<h3>Cold Bidding of Yarn</h3>
<p>The market atmosphere was quite calm in the opening session of the yarn bidding market. Because both long and short sides in the market were silent, there were very few transactions. Blackboards accounted for the majority of the offerings. As a result, the near end rose by 1, 2, and 3 dimes. The market remained weak in the afternoon session. It is found that current yarn sales are smooth, and the turnover of various groups is around 2,200. However, the market sentiment has not been stimulated. Because the end of the year is approaching, most people are closing their positions, and new buyers are relatively rare. Therefore, each month fell by 2, 4, and 6 dimes. It is found that 500 bales were sold by Ren, 200 bales by Xinchang, 600 bales by Dafeng, 200 bales by Mingde, 450 bales by Shenji, 300 bales by Yi Da, and 400 bales by Yicheng. 750 bales were bought by Gengfeng, 400 bales by Changfeng, 350 bales by Suilong, 300 bales by Yuanyi, and 250 bales by Xincheng.

<p>The cotton market started strong and then fell. But U.S. cotton saw mixed gains and losses. Indian cotton rose, and the market was relatively strong. However, the local market showed weakness. This was because of news of declining prices in Hankou and the producing areas, coupled with sluggish demand from Shanghai factories. Therefore, the market gradually showed weakness.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Seems to Have a Cheerful Appearance</h3>
<p>When the Biao cotton market opened, Indian cotton continued to rise. People's sentiment was good, but the yarn market was weak. The market was relatively flat until the third closing session. As a result, each month rose by a fraction to a dime. In the afternoon, some bulls closed their positions and short positions increased. It was heard that the market price in Hankou was slightly loose, and people's sentiment was tired. However, the bulls in the Tongzhou gang and the financial sector remained unchanged. As a result, each month fell by one and a half to two dimes. It is found that 2,000 piculs were sold by Jifeng, 1,300 piculs by Dafu, 1,000 piculs by Hengyi, 1,200 piculs by Ruichang, 4,600 piculs by Changfeng, 1,400 piculs by Yuanda, and 1,900 piculs by Tongxing. 1,000 piculs were bought by Ruichang, 3,300 piculs by Senkang, 2,500 piculs by Xincheng, 2,100 piculs by Changhe, 1,200 piculs by Qingfeng, and 1,600 piculs by Yuanxingchang.

<p>Total 804,900</p>
<h3>Factory Demand Has Completely Stalled</h3>
<p>Spot cotton sales remain sparse. Factory demand is not smooth. The source is 1,750 bales of Yao cotton flower and 385 bales of Tong cotton flower. Spot cotton business has completely stalled.</p>
<h3>Hankou Cotton is Slow to Sell</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The cotton market situation in this city is that 5,273 piculs and 90 kilograms have passed the inspection by the Commodity Bureau, and 582 piculs have failed the re-inspection. Because the Shanghai exchange rate is still shrinking and money is extremely tight, various cotton firms are hesitant to transport goods to Shanghai. Sales are sluggish and market prices have also fallen by about one yuan. It is found that Hankou First Factory, Shenxin Factory, and foreign firms Xinchun, Yuji, and Japanese firm Taian purchased a total of 480 large bales, 502 medium bales, and 880 small bales. 471 pieces were transported to Shanghai, equivalent to 3,973 and a half piculs. The price at Yuekou was 33 yuan 9 and a half dimes to 34 yuan, the price at Tianmen was 33 yuan 8 and a half dimes, the price at Liujiage was 33 yuan 8 and a half dimes per picul, the price at Zaoyang was 34 yuan 2 dimes, and the price at Zhumadian was 34 yuan 5 dimes to 35 yuan 7 dimes.</p>
<h3>Minor Fluctuations in US Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened steadily, rising slightly by 1 point. Domestic and foreign counterparts all bought in. However, brokers sold slightly due to the weakness of Chicago wheat. At the same time, the amount sold to the government has not disappeared. After that, there was not much change. The December bull slightly closed out, and Japanese merchants sold, but they were all absorbed by mainland merchants, especially the October contract. The closing was stable, up or down 1 point. The spot price was unchanged, the near-term futures fell 1 point, and the far-term futures rose 1 point. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 12th):</p>
<p>US Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to National Currency British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to National Currency</p>

<p>Also, according to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairo Creek Flower on the 13th was 227 rupees, down 7 and a half annas from the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>Grains - Futures Flour Plunged by 4-5 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after foreign wheat was quoted in the flour market, all months showed a consistent and miserable decline. According to foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell by about 1 dime to 4 dimes, and Canada fell by about 1-2 dimes. When the prices were opened, due to the continued small price of foreign wheat and the rumor that foreign wheat would no longer be taxed, people were very uneasy. The opening prices fell one after another. Generally, bulls gradually spit out, and factories also continued to sell. Near and far market sentiments fell in unison. When the afternoon market opened, the market sentiment in each month was still weak. The current month was relatively stable in the midst of weakness due to active spot sales. The long term contract prices continued to fall due to factory hedging, and sellers continued to sell. Looking at the subsequent ups and downs, we should look at the foreign wheat situation and then determine the ups and downs. As a result, the current month fell 3 cents compared to the previous day, January fell 3 cents 7.5 li, February fell 4 cents 2.5 li, March fell 4 cents, and April and May fell 5 cents 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Consistent Decline in Wheat Futures and Spot</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the late morning, each month showed a consistent decline. According to foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell by about 1 dime to 4 dimes, and Canada fell by 1-2 dimes. When the prices were opened, the market situation in each month was that the end of the national calendar was approaching, and all parties were watching and waiting. Therefore, although the price of foreign wheat continued to be small, the transactions in each session were not prosperous. In the afternoon sessions, the market presented a settled situation, with no ups and downs compared to the morning. It is feared that such a situation will continue unless there is only a small increase of 2 cents, January will be down 3 cents, and February and March will be down 5 cents. In the spot wheat market, due to the continuous decline in the flour market, factories are watching and waiting. The prices quoted by each stall are 3-5 cents lower, and the price of Guiede Xuzhou wheat is 4 yuan 2-3 cents, and the price of Yao Guan wheat is 4 yuan. 3,000 bags will be shipped by Huafeng, it is said.</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market is in a heavy state. Flour sales are good. The news that France is dumping surplus wheat has also resurfaced. The Winnipeg market is slightly soft due to a lack of maintenance.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat 11th 12th Increase/Decrease</p>

<h3>North and South Rice Markets Down Another Dime</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, fewer groups came to the market, a total of 40 groups (nearly 7,000 dan of goods). Sales were average and morale was difficult to boost. Although Qingdao gangs brought in nearly 1,000 bags, it was short-term and difficult to grasp. Late rice continued to fall by a dime, while each thick japonica rice fell by another dime and a half. Du Yangjian also brought a small dime, and Yin Yuan also showed weakness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 34-5 groups arrived from Hexia, with about 110 boats stored in the river. Sales of white japonica rice were flat, and retail sales were the same. Each sharp and early thin rice brought small gains, and Bian Yuan and Yin Yuan prices had some transactions. The market price of white japonica rice was down nearly a dime, each tip was flat and tired. Bian Yuan was up a dime, and early thin rice was up a small dime.</p>
<h3>Xiang Oil Rice Fell by a Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were some arrivals of customer Xian rice. Hunan oil rice was selling well and the price was high, which led to more goods being brought in. However, yesterday the local market was still, and the Zhejiang gangs were also still. Only Chongsha Changxi bought 1,140 bags of machine-milled rough rice, machine oil rice was down a small dime, and rough oil followed by a few cents. Each type of Xian rice, such as Wuxi inland rice, was slightly engaged, with a total of 2,000 bags opened. The local market only handles Rong Yuan and Machine Jing rice, and the market is flat and soft. The current foreign rice market is still active in the local market, and the market price is stable, selling 2,000 more bags of Saigon and Siam rice. Siam High Machine rice is in short supply, and is instead quite tight. Both the local market and the mainland are greedy for futures foreign rice, and there are few goods already in the warehouse being released. However, yesterday the market was slightly soft due to the insistence of various foreign firms to sell.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 bags of Siam rice were loaded by China Merchants Bureau's Gongping Wheel, as mentioned in previous reports. Yesterday, according to the China Merchants Bureau, the ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday (12th). Due to the heavy fog on the sea recently, navigation was inconvenient and the speed was reduced, so it could not arrive in Shanghai as scheduled. Gongping also reported that it would have to be postponed to Monday next week (17th) before it could arrive in Shanghai. As for the unloading of foreign rice into the warehouse, the Bureau has now stipulated that it will be unloaded into the South Warehouse of Yangjiadu in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Sales of Chinese Silk to the US Have Been Completely Usurped by Japanese Silk</h3>
<p>Japanese silk is being sold cheaply in the United States, causing sales of Chinese silk to the US to plummet. This year, from January to the end of last month (ie November), the total amount of silk shipped from Shanghai to the US was only 2,488 bales, only about two-tenths of the amount in the same period last year (over 12,000 bales of silk were exported to the US from January to the end of November last year). At the beginning of the month, US sales seemed to be active, and each US firm in Shanghai started to cover their short positions. For a time, over 700 bales of yellow and white silk were traded, and the price also rose by 30-40 yuan. However, the situation was only temporary. Yesterday, according to Mr. Shi, an important Chinese employee of the silk building of American firm Ganli Foreign Firm, the reason for the decline in sales of Chinese silk to the US is that Japanese Akiran, although it was a soft harvest this year, has a very large backlog of goods (raw silk) from previous years. They are now actively shipping and dumping in the US. Therefore, more than 40,000 bales of Japanese silk were imported into New York in the middle of last month, and the current inventory (Japanese silk) is about 70,000 bales. They are being sold cheaply in the market, and the process is continuing unabated. Therefore, the current silk market price is unlikely to stabilize, and there is still no possibility of a turnaround in sales of Chinese silk to the US.</p>
<h3>Precious Eyebrow Pearl Tea Sales to Europe Recovered</h3>
<p>Green tea such as the eyebrow shrimp eye sesame pearl of Luzhuang has been quiet in recent days. Yesterday, British firms Xiehe, Tongfu, Fushi, and Dude Foreign Firms responded to overseas telegraphs and gathered to search for it again. However, because there are not many high-quality ones, the goods of high-end firms are still in short supply. Green tea such as needle eyebrow and bud eyebrow also continue to be actively traded. Although the green tea situation has caused many merchants to suffer losses due to the rapid price drop in the past few months, judging from the current market situation, it seems not difficult to clear the inventory. As for black tea from the two lakes (Hunan and Hubei), British firm Jinlong Foreign Firm imported more than 400 boxes yesterday, and the market is still stable.</p>
<h3>Metals - White Iron Tile Was Almost Completely Purchased</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of white iron in the spring and summer seasons, the industry did not dare to place orders for the autumn and winter sales. Therefore, the current imports are like morning stars, and the inventory in the market is also about to be purchased completely. Currently, building gangs and product gangs are adding more, but the No. 26 color is already in a situation where there is no stock to supply. Driven by the environment, prices are rising step by step. It is estimated that No. 24 sells for 11 yuan 4 and a half dimes per dan, No. 26 sells for 12 yuan 5 dimes, and No. 28 sells for 13 yuan 3 and a half dimes, all up about 2 dimes compared to before. It is found that the current circulating goods are extremely scarce, and the morale is very good. Therefore, there is still a possibility that the standard will continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Small Guangzhou Leather, Market Weak</h3>
<p>In the past month, the 2-foot, 6-foot, 18-sheet large Guangzhou leather has seen active purchasing and a brisk market trend. The standard price soared to 11 yuan 5 dimes. Because buyers were in urgent need, they did not reduce their demand because of the high price. Therefore, the market trading was still very pleasant. In recent days, the new goods have arrived frequently, but because the end of the year is approaching and money is tight, the way out is much less and the market is declining day by day. It is estimated that each dan sells for 10 yuan 2 and a half dimes, a drop of 5 dimes compared to before. If the decline continues to weaken, morale will soften again, and there is a fear of another drop in sales.</p>

<h3>Humor of the League of Nations Council</h3>
<p>— Niu</p>
<p>The weather was sultry, and I was sitting alone in my garret, feeling very bored. My body felt a little itchy. Thinking that I hadn't taken a bath in over a month, I decided to go take one. So I grabbed a change of clothes and went to a nearby bathhouse. I undressed, took off my belt, washed, scrubbed my back, got out of the tub, wiped myself dry—everything. The attendant was very kind and even placed a short stool in front of me before I went to sleep, to massage my feet. At that moment, my happiness and joy were truly beyond words. [I don't know if the ox dreams of being a butterfly, or the butterfly dreams of being an ox. There must be a distinction between the ox and the butterfly.]</p>
<p>At that time, I looked up at the ceiling, picked my teeth with a toothpick, or examined my fingernails, which I hadn't trimmed in over two months, to see how long they had grown. At this moment, I, Niu, was truly relaxed and carefree, pure and without worries, completely happy. If there were a camera at this moment, taking a picture of me in this [bull-headed horse] pose, I think it would be even more comical and humorous than the faces of [Laurel] and [Hardy].</p>
<p>A dispatch from Geneva on the 10th reported that when the League of Nations Council reopened its meeting this afternoon, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu spoke, severely criticizing Hungary. [He said that they had never felt such a loss as the death of Count Albert Apponyi, the former Hungarian representative to the League of Nations. The Count had always relied on this to engage in debate, and Hungarian commentators were now facing unwarranted condemnation. He had resided in England and Switzerland for a long time. Could one ask if the histories of these two countries allowed fugitives to carry weapons and practice with weapons, bullets, and explosives?] Many council members were uneasy upon hearing the Romanian Foreign Minister's words. The Italian representative, Aloisi, stared at the ceiling, the French Foreign Minister, Leygues, picked his teeth, and the British Lord Privy Seal, Eden, frequently examined his fingernails. I think the several council members of the League of Nations were somewhat distressed at this moment, because as members of the League of Nations Council, they were unable to resolve the problem of the Marseille massacre. Now, hearing the Romanian Foreign Minister's debate, they could only remain silent and feign composure, which was somewhat awkward.</p>
<p>The League of Nations was originally a machine for the great powers to divide the spoils. It might have some means of resolving disputes between small and weak countries, and it might have the authority to make judgments. However, if it encountered a powerful country causing trouble, it could be said that there was absolutely no solution. For example, during the [September 18th Incident] in our country, our representative eloquently spoke at several League of Nations meetings, directly stating justice and fairness. However, the League of Nations council members were ultimately unable to take action and could only look at the ceiling, pick their teeth, and frequently examine their fingernails. What other solutions were there? Therefore, the League of Nations' [paper tiger] had long been pierced by the Japanese. What else could it do? As the saying goes, [One cannot be an elder if one is not foolish and deaf.] This is the best attitude for the League of Nations Council members to adopt. Although this attitude is similar to mine when I take a bath, the reproach in their consciences must cause some hidden pain, some [embarrassment]. If a [photograph] of the council members were taken at this time, it would certainly be interesting.</p>
<h3>Saigon Shore</h3>
<p>— Li Dan</p>
<p>The ship drifted past the Seven Islands Sea, and the dark black seawater gradually turned light green. Green mountains also appeared vaguely in the distance. The travelers on board, who were heading to Nanyang to make a living, their vague hopes were gradually turning into more concrete joy. A large group of newcomers who had never tasted the life of a ["foreign guest"] were even more swayed by dreams of yellow gold. They were filled with fresh hope of being a ["foreign guest"]! To go to a foreign land to be a ["foreign guest"] and make money! Although the foreign land was somewhat hazy and elusive, it was, after all, the birthplace of many wealthy people in their hometowns. Therefore, many of them sold their children into debt to raise the fare, their hearts filled with bitterness, yet they came with surprise.</p>
<p>The ship entered the port, and the travelers' moods were even more lively. The seventy-nine bends along the harbor were so beautiful and winding, like a long snake crawling in a winding manner. Countless harbors passed one after another. Both sides were lush with green grass. There were no tall trees in the high sky, only a vast expanse of dense green. Interspersed in the middle were some thatched houses, without the tall buildings like in their homeland. These were the poor dwellings of the Vietnamese natives. The scenery was different from that of their homeland.</p>
<p>After passing the seventy-nine bends, the towering buildings of the customs and merchants on the Saigon shore stood before them. They had arrived in the foreign land! The travelers had long packed their luggage, waiting to leave the tiresome ship and climb to their destination to experience new tastes. However, their fervent hopes gradually turned weary. The ship had docked for a long time, but there was still no movement. Apart from some overseas Chinese who came to pick up guests, the French and Vietnamese people in front of the customs walked around as if nothing had happened. As if they had nothing to do with the anxious guests on the ship.</p>
<p>First, the Japanese freely went ashore, strutting into Saigon city without going through the ["New Guest Office"]. Next, the wealthy and shop owners with street license taxes had bribed people in advance to have their relatives and friends pick them up with joy.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>What remained was the largest number of impoverished people. They could not bribe people in advance, so they could only wait anxiously. However, time passed, and there was still no response, only their own unease and commotion increased dramatically. Inevitably, impatient and worried voices arose:</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Why can't we go ashore yet?"</p>
<p>However, the area in front of the customs remained quiet. No French or Annamese people approached the ship. They gazed eagerly, but their gazes fell on the empty ground, wandering aimlessly. Children cried on the ship, and women murmured.</p>
<p>It was noon, with the sun blazing, when the French entered the New Guest Office to work. The travelers on the ship had been waiting for half a day. Standing in the intense sunlight, they were dazed and exhausted, their legs sore and their arms weak, but they still had to wait patiently. These guests were guarded by the Annamese people who had lost their country, waiting for the French to complete the entry procedures.</p>
<p>The sunlight near the equator was hotter than in their homeland. This was the first new taste of the foreign land they experienced. Waiting to go to the New Guest Office would bring even more trouble. By the time the ship reached the Saigon shore, they had already lost their admiration for being a "foreign guest" and could not help but think of their families in their hometown. They sighed that a foreign land was not as good as their homeland! But they also saw the Japanese and wealthy Chinese people, who were in a different situation altogether.</p>
<h3>Night Watchmen, Street Singers, Fortune Tellers</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>| Impressions of Beiping, Part Four</p>
<p>The ancient city, like an old man, went to rest early, exhausted from its accumulated fatigue. The night in the ancient city was lonely, unlike the bustling all-night activity in other cities; this loneliness came very early.</p>
<p>In the loneliness, there were three kinds of people struggling: night watchmen, street singers, and fortune tellers. The three kinds of people used three different sounds to express their activities: a clapper, a sanxian lute, and a xiao flute. They all had a mournful tone.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock, the sudden sound of the clapper could be heard in the lonely alley—this was the first watch. When you heard the clapper rhythmically sounding five times, five times, that was the fifth watch, around four or five in the morning, when it was almost dawn. Regardless of wind, snow, or night, the watchmen always followed the dark alleys, turning corner after corner, constantly watching every household's gate. If it was open, they would wake up the owner of the gate: "Hey, be careful, close it." Then they would continue with their rhythmic clapper sound. The sound was a warning, but small businesses working at night would gradually submit when they heard the sound getting closer. The watchmen held a bamboo pole with a hook. This bamboo pole aroused many imaginations in me: a timid thief crouching on the black wall, a ladder leaning against someone's wall, or a black coat hanging on a telephone pole against the wall... let the dim light in their hands illuminate them...</p>
<p>The sound was also a comfort, with a spirited courage in the sound of the clapper, like the guardian of the sleeping people. However, in the ears of those who could not sleep, the sound was reckless. Tossing and turning, just when they were planning not to calculate the time, the sound would knock into your heart, telling you what time it was.</p>
<p>The sound of the clapper still had a bit of courageous breath, but the sanxian lute and the xiao flute only had begging tones. In the mournfulness, there seemed to be some sobbing.</p>
<p>Those playing the sanxian lute often brought young girls, and sometimes, this person would be the girl's family member. They always played the same tune, occasionally hitting a large drum. The so-called large drum was actually not very large. It was placed in front of the girl when she was about to sing, supported on a triangular frame to keep the girl's rhythm. Their activity area was mostly near apartments and hostels. Tired guests or wanderers sometimes had the need to talk to a woman. ["Waiter, call in the drum player."] In the fifteen-candlepower electric-lit room of the apartment, they bargained about the price, ordered songs, and did that uninteresting and necessary work. After it was over,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>[Give a few extra coins for drinks, sir." the lute player pleaded, then walked out of the apartment door and played the same tune on another] street, still sobbing.</p>
<p>The sound of the xiao flute contained more resentment in the sobbing, as if resenting the ups and downs of fate? However, they were fortune tellers. Why were fortune tellers mostly blind? I didn't understand. They held a bamboo cane, touching the uneven ground. They should know the height of the ground, and they never doubted their foothold, walking forward step by step, like the resentment that fate had destined. They were calculating other people's fates, knowing which old man was born in which year, and which girl would marry in which year; but they seemed not to calculate their own fates, they only resented.</p>
<h3>How to Choose Magazines and How to Read Magazines?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuqing</p>
<p>Because this year is magazine year, the number of magazines will reach more than six hundred. From the perspective of the entire culture, this is something worth celebrating - indeed, it breaks the strange phenomenon of the distorted culture of China in previous years. However, for those of us suffering from knowledge hunger, how should we choose magazines and how should we read magazines?</p>
<p>Indeed, there are too many modern books, and at the same time, the expensive prices are really beyond the reach of those below the middle class - and modern life is very busy. It is really not easy for those who are busy with life to take some time to seek knowledge! The first principle is to take the most economical method that my own financial ability can afford; the second is to take the most practical knowledge, with the knowledge I need as the goal, then only magazines are suitable.</p>
<p>Looking at the sales of magazines and the stagnation of books in recent years, most of the reason is, of course, due to the weak purchasing power of the majority of people. Although not every single book is bad, and not every single magazine is good, in short, Chinese society has first become distorted, and then this strange phenomenon of distorted culture has occurred.</p>
<p>How to choose magazines and how to read magazines? Perhaps many readers already understand, or perhaps some people really need such an answer? However, I am very frank to say: I am not a famous scholar, and the motivation for me to write this article now is nothing more than to talk about some of my own feelings about reading magazines.</p>
<p>First of all, before we open a magazine and are about to read it, we should first recognize whether this magazine is the magazine I need. The reason is that the content of a magazine is more complicated than that of a book, and at the same time it also has specialized properties, so what should it be like? Naturally, first of all we should know the common sense of magazine classification, but however, this distinction is very difficult. I have seen someone say this: [There are so many magazines that it is really difficult for people to distinguish between good and bad at once! And it is always inevitable that the people who run magazines have a background. Of course, they have received money from others, so they cannot help but say a few words for the people who paid the money? However, many writers use pen names, and it is really easy to be deceived when it is first published, so you often have to see their details after the expiration date, and the content is finally explained by itself.] Therefore, when we have a magazine in hand, we should first distinguish the content of this magazine. Of course, magazines and writers who stand on a purely objective position are not completely non-existent.</p>
<p>As for how to read magazines? However, there are only four ways to read magazines: (1) Read all: that is, to read a magazine completely, regardless of whether you need it or not, read it all once to understand the entire content of the magazine. (2) Selective reading: Read what you love or what you really need. (3) Speed reading: be more casual than reading everything, more like interesting essays and novels, so as to understand the general content of the whole article. (4) Read carefully: every article should be read carefully, like the attitude of a critic, using a calm mind and discerning eyes to measure the content of the magazine, but do not add your own subjective opinions, and stand in a purely objective position.</p>
<h3>Sunbathing</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Solitude</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>The cold wind whipped across the quiet road surface, and withered yellow leaves tumbled on the ground. He paced slowly, feeling lonely and depressed in his heart. He was thinking, thinking about the past, the present, and what about the future? He could only look at the dark sky and the quiet road, feeling lost. ["Will it always be like this?"] He often asked himself this question, but who could give him an answer? Only the wind, tightly whipping the road surface, echoed in his ears, as if saying: ["Your future is just like you running on this road now."]</p>
<p>The black hand of night tightly touched the head of the city, and darkness occupied the world before his eyes. He stared blankly, watching the lights of the bustling streets in the distance. He hated it, hated it. Everything made him feel sad, understanding that this hatred, this hate, were all superfluous, all thoughts that a lonely person should not have. He understood that a few years ago, when he was living a happy life, he saw those, those things that were now placed in his eyes were lovely, how madly he pursued them. However, people's psychology is selfish and insufficient. When he had such a joyful environment, he never thought of those people who were in the same situation as he is now. But now, it had changed, the environment had changed, his feelings had also changed, and he only felt his own sadness and loneliness. A person, like him, was just so selfish.</p>
<p>[Fallen, right! I am just so lonely, the sadness of the end of the petty bourgeoisie!]</p>
<p>He closed his tired eyes, shook the old autumn clothes on his body, lay down on the cold bed, and sank into the dream sea of ​​memories.</p>
<p>He thought, he dreamed, he remembered a winter night in Chengdao City.</p>
<p>Winter in the island city was lovely, warm, and beautiful. It was a clear afternoon, he was holding Apple's hand, walking slowly on the beach, bathing in the sunlight, listening to the faint whistling of the tide. The shallow sand on the beach was a stretch of white, and he and she were walking slowly along the curve of the bay.</p>
<p>[Let's walk again! This is the last time you see the scenery of this island city. Go and hope, I intend to leave here one day, to spend a winter, that severe winter, and be with you at the same time.]</p>
<p>He seemed to be drunk, he didn't feel anything, he should how to answer her, how to say some comforting words to her, he just looked at that under his feet, he felt depressed and lonely, he felt such a mood for the first time.</p>
<p>The sun was jumping on the vast deep blue water, as if telling people; [It's almost evening, happy people! Leave here! The night of the city is waiting for you to enjoy, there are all your world, don't be drunk! Happy people.]</p>
<p>The cold wind pierced into her body, he understood, he woke up, he knew that it was the past. He opened his eyes and looked at the dark house. Everything was blurred and silent before his eyes. He stretched his waist and looked out the window. What was placed before his hatred was the prosperous night of the city, the bright night, the night of the happy, and the intoxicating night.</p>
<p>Lonely, lonely, he only felt the loneliness of life even more, and he murmured again!</p>
<p>[No way, right! I am just so lonely, the sadness of the end of the petty bourgeoisie!]</p>

<h3>American Cars Re-enter the European Market</h3>
<p>— Shirley</p>
<p>| Exports have doubled in the past six months |</p>
<p>In the past 22 years, Europe has suffered from economic depression. Various industries have been severely hit. The decline in social economy and the unemployment of workers are innumerable. In order to remedy any possible situation, the government has adopted a strict attitude towards the intrusion of foreign goods. Either high tariff barriers are built, or taxes are increased. Countries like France, Italy, and Germany have used this method to resist the entry of foreign cars. On the one hand, it can limit the outflow of money, and on the other hand, it can relieve unemployed workers in the country. Considering the economic relations of various countries, it is of course not too strong. This situation seemed to change slightly until this spring. Because the economic situation in Europe has slightly improved, and various industries have also improved accordingly. Afterwards, the situation improved day by day. Until recently, the European car market has undergone a major change. Among them, the position of American cars has increased day by day. Originally, the sales were stagnant, but now they feel very active. Originally, people could not afford to buy them, but now they are eager to try. Moreover, many large American cars are selling well in Europe. It is expected that the situation will continue to improve in the future.</p>
<p>Among the European countries that manufacture cars, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are the most developed. Because the United Kingdom's machinery industry is developed and its territorial exports are more abundant, its car industry is even better than that of France and Italy. In recent years, the United Kingdom has seized the opportunity of various countries to reduce the purchase of American cars and has been working hard to gain a more dominant car market in Europe. Originally, this opportunity was very good, and it has already achieved some success. Unfortunately, the current situation has changed, and the original hope has inevitably become a bubble. Because in fact, American cars in Europe have not only recovered the market they have lost recently, but also have the possibility of increasing it. At the same time, the British car market in Europe has suffered a major blow. This point cannot but worry British car manufacturers. In addition, in the past three or four months, the British domestic car market has been invaded by American cars. American cars are also selling well in other territories. Originally, this part of trade could be regarded as the private property of the British, but now it has been seized by the Americans. How can British car merchants not be sweating?</p>
<p>According to the statistics of British car manufacturers, in the first six months of 1934, the number of cars exported from the United States to Europe, excluding Great Britain, totaled 27,000. As for the cars manufactured in the United Kingdom and exported to European countries, there were only 5,643. The total number of British car exports includes 1,365 cars exported to the Irish Free State. This market is extremely beneficial to the British car market. As for American cars, they are almost completely unable to enter Ireland. The reason for this is easy to understand. Because the government of the Irish Free State now prohibits the import of all foreign cars. It can be seen that American cars not only have no way to enter Ireland at present, but it is also difficult to predict the future situation for a while. Therefore, in the first six months of this year, although the United States had 30,000 complete cars imported into European countries, only 198 went to Ireland. Compared with the total number, it is less than one percent.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1934, from January to June, Belgium was the country where American cars sold the best in the European market. Although Belgium levies a very high import tax on foreign cars, it purchased 9,751 cars from the United States in these six months. The Swedish car market has been noticed by British car manufacturers in recent years. In half a year, it purchased 5,463 American cars. It bought only 433 mobility products from Great Britain. The comparison between the two is very different. Speaking of the United Kingdom itself, it is the third-best customer for buying American cars in Europe. In the first six months of this year, the United Kingdom imported a total of 3,759 American cars. In addition, American cars imported 3,362 cars into Denmark and 2,638 into the Netherlands. Only 328 British cars were imported. 1,580 American cars were imported into Switzerland, but only 141 British cars were imported.</p>
<p>If we take the world as a whole, the number of American cars exported to various countries around the world in the first six months of 1934 has increased by more than double compared with the same period in 1933. As of the end of June 1934, the United States had more than doubled. As of the end of June 1934, the number of privately-owned cars sold by the United States overseas reached 78,636. In the same period in 1933, it was 33,386. Adding the 30,000 cars purchased by European countries, 28,316 of them were purchased by various parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The automotive industry in Great Britain itself is also quite developed at present. However, in some periods in the past, the number of American cars imported into the United Kingdom was very small. There are two reasons for this. One is the implementation of the horsepower tax, which greatly reduced the sales of large cars. The second is the tariff barrier. Foreign cars are inevitably hit. In addition, factors such as the poor social economy and the increase in the number of unemployed are closely related. Therefore, the sales of American cars in the United Kingdom can be said to be dripping. As for the specifics, the situation has changed. The number of American cars imported into the United States has increased fivefold this year compared with last year. According to official statistics, from January 1 to September 30 this year, a total of 5,234 American cars were sold in the United Kingdom. In the same period of nine months last year, it was 1,430 cars. The United Kingdom also imported 2,240 cars from its territories. The original manufacturers of these cars were the United States. However, in order to reduce the tax from 33 and one-third percent to 25 percent, they were assembled in Canada and transshipped to the United Kingdom. In the past, the United Kingdom collected a tax of 33 and one-third percent on the import of foreign-made cars. And those from Canada can enjoy special benefits. Therefore, these cars seem to be exported from Canada on the surface, but in reality, they are transshipped goods from the United States. Canada purchased 171 French automobiles and 113 automobiles from other countries in the world.</p>
<h3>1935 Model Austin New Car</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>｜Already Arrived in Shanghai｜</p>
<p>I have considered that the Austin Motor Company has its own definite and unwavering policy for the construction of new cars, and is not blindly following and echoing others, merely changing designs for the sake of it. Because of this, the company has exhausted its thoughts and carefully studied the matter, and after manufacturing a truly reliable vehicle, it does not act rashly or change it easily, hoping to show off its novelty and originality. Even if there are slight changes in each year, they are all mainly to meet public needs. The reason why Austin's value and reliability have always enjoyed a great reputation in the world is that this policy is one of its major reasons. Now, the 1935 model Austin new car has arrived in Shanghai. Here is a brief description of its general situation, as follows, to be offered to readers.</p>
<p>The Austin factory believes that what is needed this year is a more spacious body, rather than major changes in the mechanical aspects. Therefore, there are currently no so-called streamlined sedans or independent suspensions. Regarding streamlined sedans, Sir Austin once expressed his opinion that the sloping screens installed on this type of body are suitable for obstructing the driver's vision. However, the Austin new car does not have such shortcomings. The slight changes made to the new car are that the body lines are longer, and the posture is more graceful and natural. As for the newly designed water tank shell and the long engine hood, they make the entire form extremely beautiful and spectacular. The various facilities are more uniform and unified than before, and they are all inlaid in the body, so the overall appearance is more clean and elegant, without any cumbersomeness. As for the chassis, the main improvement in the mechanical engineering of the 1935 model Austin new car is that the second gear shift, the third gear, and the final gear all use synchronized shifting. According to Sir Austin's speech on this reform, the factory believes it is insignificant and unnecessary. It is only because the public likes this device that it is specially installed on the new car to meet the needs of the public. As for the Hayes gearbox, it has already won the admiration of the general public at the last exhibition and is recognized as a unique feature of Austin. However, due to various difficulties in production, it has not been fully utilized. Now, production has greatly increased, and both the 16 and 18 horsepower models can be equipped with it. Although the Austin new car has the above-mentioned improvements, the selling price is roughly the same as before, with little change. Among them, the 7-horsepower model is the most commendable. In terms of price, it has a considerable reduction, while in terms of quality, its various improvements and great progress are unmatched by other similar vehicles. Its chassis is particularly low, and the floor height is more than five inches lower than before. The rear of the body is spacious, twice as large as before. Both front seats can be folded forward for easy entry and exit, and it is extremely convenient to adjust their position separately to enjoy the ultimate comfort. Both doors are extremely wide, and the window frames are unusually narrow. The driver sits in the seat, and everything he sees is unobstructed. The body is equipped with wheel covers and luggage clips, all of which are hidden inside and do not hinder the appearance at all.</p>
<p>In addition to these various changes, there are embedded direction indicators, a convenient steering wheel manager, larger tires, a battery hidden under the engine hood, and excellent drive shafts. The ease of management and the convenience of operation are enough to surprise the driver. As for those who are economically minded and want to enjoy the pleasure of riding in a car at the lowest cost, there is the Austin Opal two-seater, which retails for only 100 pounds in its country, equipped with an old-fashioned water tank, with the same appearance as the product from last year.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned progress and changes are not only for the small Austin but also for the larger cars. The 1-horsepower four-cylinder model has exceeded 50,000 units in output. The new equipment includes a balanced voltmeter, double windshield wipers, new headlights, and a heat-preserving and cold-preserving device. The sedan body is wider and more spacious than before. The lightweight 12-horsepower model can use either a 12.9-horsepower four-cylinder engine or a 13.9 or 15.9-horsepower six-cylinder engine. If a larger chassis is needed, there are 16-horsepower and 18-horsepower models. The台約克轿车 (Tái Yuēkè Jiàochē, could not translate) is the newest model added. All of these models can be equipped with temporary seats, so they can accommodate up to seven passengers without feeling cramped. Moreover, the rear seats are extremely easy to adjust, making them particularly easy to control. Furthermore, these cars can be equipped with Hayes gearboxes if needed. As for the 12-horsepower four-cylinder model, it has also been equipped with synchronized two-gear shifts, but all the management devices remain the same and have not been changed. Finally, it must be mentioned that the 20-horsepower model is a large car of magnificent splendor. In addition to all the latest progress of the other Austin new cars, it also has a strong and outstanding low-slung X-shaped frame and a new steering gear.</p>
<p>Regarding overseas sales, the Austin new car also has many features. For example, all models, except for the 12-horsepower four-cylinder and 20-horsepower models, can be equipped with left-hand steering wheels and management devices, special ground clearance, special suspension and tires, and three-layer thick glass. These are all the major features.</p>
<p>As for the Austin truck group, it includes a 7-horsepower model with a load capacity of five CWt·, a 10-horsepower four-cylinder model with six to eight Cwt·, a lightweight 12-horsepower six-cylinder, and a lightweight 12-horsepower four-cylinder model with various chassis. All of these vehicles only use synchronized final gear and three-gear shifts. In addition to this, there are ambulance chassis and 12-horsepower four-cylinder bus chassis equipped with inverted rear springs to lower the body frame.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>As for Austin sports cars, there are a total of five types: the Nimble 7-horsepower, the Express 7-horsepower, the 10-horsepower four-cylinder律普萊式 (Lǜ Pǔlái Shì, could not translate), the 紐勃里運動篷車 (Niǔ Bólǐ Yùndòng Péngchē, could not translate), and the 坎姆登運動轎車 (Kǎnmǔdēng Yùndòng Jiàochē, could not translate) equipped with a 12-horsepower six-cylinder.</p>
<h3>The Standard New Car is the Soul of British Cars</h3>
<p>(1) The Beauty of Performance</p>
<p>The 1935 Standard new car is unanimously recognized by the general British public as the soul of British cars. The so-called 1935 Standard car has now arrived in Shanghai and is on display in the model room of the China Motor Company on Jing'an Temple Road. The 1935 Standard 9-horsepower four-door exquisite sedan, due to its fuel economy and smooth driving, will be considered satisfactory by any car owner. In fact, this new car is a representative product of the British automobile industry's efforts. The clear lines and proper control, after the new car is constructed, have achieved such results. The engine is a four-cylinder, with a volume of 1.052 cubic centimeters. When it rotates 1,000 times per minute, the plug force can reach 18 horsepower, and when it rotates 3,000 times per minute, it can reach 23 horsepower. A single-piece dry clutch and a four-speed two-wheel box make the engine completely use a buoyancy device, that is, there are also two points in the front, all supported by rubber pads.</p>
<p>(2) The Completeness of Accessories</p>
<p>The carburetor adopts a mixed gas temperature control, and the result can save cylinder wear during long-distance travel. The ignition point and distribution can be automatic. Water gates, spark plugs, oil pool dipsticks, inverted coils, external oil pools, etc. are all perfectly placed on the side of the valve. The fan and generator are driven by the same belt. After the generator starts, the belt will automatically tighten. The gasoline input to the carburetor has a pump mechanism, which is placed on the outside like the generator. The parts box and battery are placed on the instrument panel, and there is a cam rotation. Gears two, three, and the highest gear are synchronized. The open drive shaft has a metal joint, and the關浮式 (Guān Fú Shì, could not translate) rear axle is equipped with灣拿齒輪 (Wān Ná Chǐlún, could not translate) drive. The frame uses a crossbar, which is very strong, and the plug itself can generate power. During operation, the hand lever and foot pedal are placed in front of the front seat, which is very convenient and within easy reach. The device uses semi-elliptical springs with hydraulic shock absorbers. The frame and springs are all under the rear axle.</p>
<p>(3) The Swiftness of Driving</p>
<p>This new car performs exceptionally well. Even if you travel across the entire territory of the United Kingdom, you can obtain a rate above the standard. Second gear: 28 miles per hour; third gear: 40 miles; highest gear: 55 miles. The rear wheel axle ratio is five, five-seven to one. Without special acceleration, you can also reach a considerable rate. The engine's action is very smooth. The test drive has found that all the control is very convenient. The weight of the entire car is 17 CWT·. The factory estimates that one gallon of gasoline can travel approximately 38 miles. The wheelbase is seven feet six and a half inches, and the track is three feet ten inches.</p>
<p>(4) The Ten-Horsepower New Car</p>
<p>Among the Standard new cars, in addition to the exquisite 9-horsepower car, the next is the 10-horsepower new car. The engine has a three-bearing crankshaft, water pump circulation. When the engine rotates 3,600 times per minute, the plug force can reach 32 horsepower. Among the various modern devices and accessories, there are automatic engine restart reserve瓦脱 (Wǎtuō, could not translate) control, which allows the battery to supply power as needed, so power waste can be avoided. The springs have silent coupling shaft sleeves, window switches, pure steel safety body, and the windshield can be centrally controlled. Both front and rear seats have 睹藏馬逹 (Dǔcáng Mǎdá, could not translate) for opening and closing the door and window curtains. The engine is also a four-cylinder, with a volume of 1.343 cubic centimeters. All gear ratios are 5.43, 7.88, 13.18, 21.42 to 1. The diameter of the plug drum is eight時｜｜與九四相同｜ (Shí ｜｜ Yǔ Jiǔ Sì Xiāngtóng ｜, could not translate) weighs 19 CWT, the wheelbase is seven feet ten時 (Shí, could not translate), and the track is three feet ten inches.</p>
<h3>A Record of [The Advance of the Wheels]</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The利喴 (Lì Wēi, could not translate) Motor Company screened the business propaganda film [The Advance of the Wheels] produced by the British Austin Motor Manufacturing Factory at the Carlton Theater on the 9th. It was advertised in the newspapers in advance, welcoming people from all walks of life to visit. That day happened to be a weekly holiday. At 10 o'clock in the morning, the visitors were already crowded, and both the upstairs and downstairs were full. There were even people who came with the elderly and children. Its grand occasion was unprecedented. I went to the theater and was found a seat with the help of the receptionists. There were still hundreds of people who were standing because there were no seats, and those who had nowhere to stand had to leave. Its appeal is also great.</p>
<p>The screening started at half past ten. The first scene was a family background. The father was sitting by the stove, and the son was studying at his desk. He asked his father about the traffic situation in the past. From his father's narration, the contrast between today's and yesterday's traffic was shown. First, there was a horse-drawn carriage, and the passengers in the carriage were very crowded. After a while of galloping, they suffered a lot of bumps. Then, the first invented car was shown, and then the modern car was shown, some of which were ridden by individuals, and some were double-decker for public riding. The richness and comfort of them cannot be compared with the past. Then, the earliest train was shown. The passenger car where the passengers were sitting had no awnings and no windows, just like a side car for transporting stone ballast. There were many passengers inside, all squatting in the car. When getting off the car, they used short wooden ladders to help each other to get off. Compared with today's passengers who can read books and newspapers and eat Western food in the car, it is like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>After comparing the old and new means of transportation, the internal working conditions of the Austin factory were shown. Whether it was the body, wheels, engine, etc., even as small as a steel rod or a crank, the manufacturing process was shown in detail. After the car was completed, it was painted, packed, and exported, all of which were presented in front of us. Even if we personally visited the factory, its authenticity would be no more than this. The factory covers an area of 93 acres, has 16,000 workers, and 600 supervisors, which is the largest in Europe. What is particularly noteworthy is that the painting department is all female workers. When working, they use the car body as a mirror and frequently take care of their hair, which is enough to show the brightness of the car body.</p>
<p>After the various departments in the factory were shown, the miracle of climbing mountains produced by the factory was shown. The mountain was the high peak of Norway, covered with snow, and it was extremely difficult to climb. However, the car finally reached its summit, and the excellence of its mechanical power can be generally seen.</p>
<p>Then, there was a sweet family, a couple with two children taking a suburban tour in an Austin car, enjoying the fun of nature in a forest. There were also those who drove with their companions to swim by the sea, all feeling content. In short, all of this reveals the need for cars for the people and the necessity of owning them.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a famous British landscape film, with clear mountains and rivers, which made people feel relaxed and yearning, almost as if they were in the scene. It is found that advertising-style propaganda films are the most difficult to arouse the interest of the audience, because their materials are narrow and have a dull taste. This film alone uses a novel story narrative, supplemented by beautiful landscape photography, and puts business propaganda unconsciously. This is truly a mirror for various automobile manufacturers. Therefore, I recorded what I remembered.</p>
