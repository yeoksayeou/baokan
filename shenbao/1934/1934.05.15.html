<p>前據報載。本年二月十六日。英政府曾通知國聯會秘書長愛文諸氏。謂倫敦郵政局。接『滿洲國』郵政總管理局來函。請照郵政聯曾會公約規定。將各種統計表寄與『滿洲國』。以便對假道洲往退寄送之郵件淸算郵費。英國政府甚願知外國郵政與『滿洲國』郵政。在事實上發生關係。究竟能至如何限　。而不致有承認滿洲現組織之據云云。愛氏接到通知後。决定於五月十四日召集中日顧問委員會。以便研究方法。一方能使郵政章程實行於各國與滿洲地方之間。一方又不使各國有承認『滿洲國』之嫌。</p>
<p>三月十三日英掌　大臣文登在下院　請。國聯顧間會定五月十四日開會。考慮英國對『滿洲國』之郵政問題。英政府始终不改變其對於承認問題之熊度。四月子六及二十六兩日。英下院對於僞國通郵問題。復續有討論。</p>
<p>吾人確信英政府之外交政策。有維持國聯威信之誠意與必要。其建議討論與僞郵之關係問題。當不至於含乓翻國聯不承認主義之動機致使日內瓦處置滿案之唯一具體成績及其殘餘威信。摧毁無遺轉而影響英帝國維護國聯之初衷雖然吾人仍覺欲在實行郵政公約於僞滿及不承認主義之夾縫中求一圓滿出。路豈僅不易着手。簡直絕無辦法英政府如不能自擬具體提案。以供討論顧問委員會又焉能别出心裁。</p>
<p>且所謂不承認『滿洲國』之辦法。早經顧問委員會通過由國聯秘書長以通告形式送逹國聯會員國及曾經送致大會報告書之各非會員國而郵政與郵票問題。卽爲當時七種討論項目之一。中國政府事前曾請萬國郵政聯合會通告各會員國三點（一）一切滿洲郵政。暫行停辦（二）一切寄往歐美之郵件。嗣後將分經蘇　士運河及太平洋送逹中國政府請各會員國之郵政局。對於寄往中國之郵件亦採取同様辦法。（三）傀儡政府所發行之郵票一律無效。該項建議卽由顧問和員會轉請國聯會員國注意假若任何會員國能一體尊重顧問委員會及中國政府之立塲。旣不致有『假道滿洲往返寄送之郵件。』又何來僞滿郵局要求淸算郵費之根據</p>
<p>最近電訊謂。顧問委員會對於英國提議。必至感覺棘手恐將移送萬國郵政聯合會决定之。藉以迴避責任云云。不知僞滿之要求郵費淸算係按照郵政公約規定而提出。然僞滿本身。原非萬國郵政聯合會會員此後縱欲參加公約。亦經顧間委員會特别向瑞士政府建議。在其、提出要求時表示反對足見移送萬國郵政聯合會之舉。仍無補事實於毫末。當顧問委員會建議不承認『滿洲國』草案時。誤將『滿洲國』與鴉片一條列入建議准許各國政府對於運往『滿洲國』之鴉片。發給護照。嗣後幸經國聯行政院予以糾正始不致鑄　承認僞滿之謬舉。此次深望該委員會愼重將事勿可再蹈覆轍　　本　二月間上海外僑聯合會因由歐洲取道西比利亞寄滬之郵件收到甚遲電請在埃及集議之國際郵務大會設法。冀籍大會之努力使取道西比利亞之郵件得以加速。外僑所嘗之痛苦。吾人　嘗不表同情然深覺其國政府當向日本嚴重交涉中國郵務當道與第三者。旣不能負責且亦無從補救吾人對於英國今茲向顧問委員會之提議亦作如是觀</p>
<p>夫顧問委員會重要使命之一。本在研究關於否認『滿洲國』所發生之種種問題者也。問題之性質。可以不同要當以切合不承認原則爲指歸吾人雖深知　國提議出於純潔之動機。然其結果將影響於不承認原則殆可斷言。在此意義下。吾人乃不能不表示堅决之反對。</p>
<p>自拉西曼報告書之發表。日人同國聯挑戰益形露骨爲國聯威信計惟有積極加强其原有之立塲。决不可使之再行軟化。夙以維護國聯爲外交政網之英政府。當更有同感也。</p>

Ｄ女士的宴會時間，祇有十五分鐘了。Ｃ先生連忙趕回家去，換上禮服，坐了汽車，趕到情人的空裏，時間却好，並未遲到。Ａ先生就入席，忽見Ｄ女士的招乎，不甚親熱，也不向賓客介紹。Ａ先生不知其故，只好冷冰冰的坐着，一塲没趣。席散之後，再三懇求，Ｄ女士方始告訴他説，宴會時頸際的横領結不能歪斜，這是此地的忌諱，賓客們也不知底細，所以並不綛眞，否則早已和你割斷愛情了。Ｃ先生恍然大悟，想那歪科的綠故，大約在下車後，把衣一牽，帶歪了領結了。留心衣帶　　有人在合抱跳舞的時候，偶一不愼，踏污了小姐雪白的舞鞋，一定要惶恐萬狀；因此步伐不正，　態大亂。其實污了舞鞋，交際塲中不以爲奇，那裏可説忌諱呢？每逢發生這種意外之事的當　，合舞的小姐，一定要輕　地安慰他道，『没有豺狼來，放心吧』！倘使小姐所穿的舞衣，胸前乳　有衣帶結的，一旦　脱，在大庭廣衆之間，萬萬不可對伊説你的結散了，也不能自作聰明，把乎指指；若有這種　動，下次再也不必要求那小姐跳舞，休想伊曾答應你的了。見了况結，連忙把放在腰間的手伸過來，伊　　　，早已知道在伊身上，發生什麽事了，伊也就停止跳舞，那麽能够替伊結了。</p>

<p>自由談	碎月灘和如意寺  英子　丨新安風景丨　　三月的麥田的輕風啊！　　萬年橋垜那幾個浣衣婦的笑聲銷沈下去了。便低低地用口笛吹着鳲鳩的呌聲，沿着那麽流利的河水、在細軟的沙灘上悉悉的踏着拍子各給蘆　遮蔽了的碎月灘走去。　　隔岸的田野那兒傳來了布　的鳴聲。　　帶着土的熱香跟阿莫尼亞的輕風從水面上飄送過來。三月的江南的農邨呵！菜花是一畦一畦的黃，麥秧是一畦一畦的綠。···　　脚下踏着那麽軟軟的沙，心却給一個悠遠的農村的夢帶去了。便出神地望着隔了一道漪流的對岸，那給淡淡的靑色的霧籠住了的遠山、那田野，那邨莊；那剛着一層嫩綠顏色的垂垂的柳絲。···　　『唧』的一聲；是南來的燕子呢。　　從嬝嬝的柳條中穿出來，又在水面上橫掠着了。水淺的地方，那兒有個壯健的船夫在艱苦地背着　，要背倒腰似的；拉着一隻小小的篾篷船緩緩兒的走。　　拐個彎，啊，瞧哪！那座巍峨壯麗的十六個大橋洞的河西橋便呈現在我眼前了。　　嗚嗚丨丨蕪屯路的汽車從橋上駛過。　　離開沙灘走上橋。橋底這頭是蕪屯路的西門站。那麽多的人啊！賣熟食的，逛馬路的，睜着眼珠了接客的。···　　走到橋當中那個凉亭那兒停下來。　　亭裏供了個送子觀音。四邊亭角上掛着風鈴！風激盪着就『叮叮』地響着那麽淸湛悠脆的聲音。　　　憂憂丨丨晴朗空曠的天空中點綴着幾隻在輕風裏泅着的蒼鷹，髣髴按照風鈴上響出的音波來跳着迴旋舞似的，飛着，飛着。　　靠着橋欄杆，閑適地望着從橋洞裏流出來的水，奔向碎月灘去。那麽幾個淺淺的灘，陽光底温柔的觸手落在上面，也給漾成細碎的潾潾的燦爛的金點子了。再過去，可以隱約望到泊在漁梁的船底檣桅。···　　這邊兒，可以望到的黃山却隱在凝靄裏。河灘下的枯黃的蘆　裏放着幾匹褐色的馬，靜悄悄地在嚙着水草。坡上底白楊樹隙裏露出遠遠的，披着春季流行色的田野。丨是米勒的田舍畫哩。　　橋盡處是太白樓。從這兒朝左邊靠山脚拐過去，向如意寺進發。　　沿着那條狹狹的仄徑走。　　裏邊是苔蘇蒙茸的露着石骨的山壁。外邊有頽圮的不完整的欄楯蜿着，許多野生的灌木叢條從那兒伸出來。叢條外有潺潺的流水響，那就是碎月灘底流水　着白石子的聲息了。　　叮叮丨丨風吹着寳塔上鐵馬的聲音。　　用急速的步調拐過去。就看到那朝山巔伸上去的石級了。石級兩旁夾着高高的參差的喬木。那麽一種靜穆的意味啊！　　便像見了熟習的朋友似的迎着走上去，轉了幾個　，打後門進了如意寺。　　寺底後邊兒有間磨房，一匹牛靜靜地躺在欄旁打着鼾，不作聲。從磨底右旁石級上拐到一泉上居』。這地方够靜謐的，據説完工還不到六年呢，雖然是那麽仄小。　　就在籐椅上躺下來。一面和　　當家師嘮叨着，一面呷着本山泉水的淸茶！許多日子來壓在脊梁上的疲倦不知怎麽一下子就减輕啦。　　而那淡淡的木瓜跟幽蘭底香味是更醉人咧。在這兒，是四季都嗅得到花香的。　　　嗚嗚丨丨杭徽路的汽車吼着從對面的山坡上駛來，曳着一縷烟，很快的在牕框裏消失了。於是一個意念在腦袋裏活動起來，便　到那個三面都開着敞窗的『印月閣』去。　　許多活躍的風景綫都跳到窗口來。　　那遠遠的問政山，那黃泥的珠蘭花舍，那葱鬱的一叢一叢的竹！那斗山，那鳥聊山，那許多放着風箏的年靑人；那山下的鱗比的屋字；那　護着屋字的城郭；那城郭外蛇似的無盡綫延展的杭徽公路；那公路坡下的河流；那河裏底航船在窗前底樹梢上躺着似的；那樹，那樹上跳竄着的小松鼠···　啊！　　便像塑在那兒似的楞着了。　　有着古舊的鄕邨空氣和近代意味的塲所啊！每一因來，總要坐到蝙蝠駛着黃昏的色情飛進這個閣子裏來酌時候，纔帶了點悵惘的情緖　上歸途。我是怎様戀戀於新安的景物啊？（一九三四；三，一○。）好名  珮離　　　　好名是一種美德，其源出自性天。與花之散芳，雁之流響，麋鹿之弄姿，孔雀之振羽，是一様的道理。故有『名譽爲第二生命』之稱，西洋人好名大槪比中國人加甚；其實聲明文物之發揚，人類的繁衍，甚有賴於『藏識』中這一種子，丨『如海遇風緣，起種種波浪』。　　照世俗的説法，世上只有兩種人··一者爲名，一午爲利。這分類也許太荒唐吧，倒是很槪括的。普通人爲了衣食，爲生活奮鬥，生無益於時，死無聞於後，是不覺得『名』之重要的，倒是切實的『利』，較爲動心。但生存的目的，不僅是『爲利』而已，而是於生存之外，要求温飽，温飽之外，要求精神的發展。占社會最高價值的是生命，生命不是用金銀可以鑄成。敎育的目的並非敎人掙錢，而是注重使生命有最高度的發展。　　試想一部人類史，除了戰功紀略或貨殖列傳外，没有歷代的文人，學者，聖哲，那狀態豈不非常可怕？一個民族通通化爲商人，到處只見談『生意經』，又將成爲什麽世界？但人類中終於出了不同一點的人，如印度的學者丨是不是『爲名』者流？丨簡直是鄙棄物質，創造出敎理，普被羣生，使人類的生活臻於較善較美之境地。　　着衣噉飯，凡人皆知，然徒然着衣吃飯，那景况便將黯淡了，雖屬有生，終無活氣，不得謂之生活。囚徒也有生活，甚而至於動植特界皆有生活，人的生活究應有所不同。古人設敎不『言利』，並非没有看淸楚人類應該着衣吃飯的。　　『爲利』者斥『爲名』爲優瓜，爲痴人，以爲要活一千歲嗎？『不朽』又怎様？反之，問他『朽』又怎様呢？也茫無可説。放開眼光看，則知一生的工作，爲己之外，也應爲旁人，爲後人！好名者是有出息的，唯恐現代人不好名。不一定是『當世名』，也有『後世名』。眞好名的在現代也許不多見吧，當亂世有名亦明哲之所忌，古來便多『隱逸』。雄雉（詩經試譯）  于夏時　　　　（一）雄的野雞在飛，翅膀慢慢地撥。我正掛念到他，他給自己阻擱（二）雄的野雞在飛，唱着高低歌聲。我的老實人兒，實在累我勞心。（三）看看光陰過去，我自長長掛懷。道路又道麽遠，乍麽能够回來！（四）凡是你們人兒難道不知道德！但不害人利己，那件不好做得？『人海』雜拾陳友琴　　關於淸代詩人，我最愛的是海寗查初白。因爲他的詩完全是以『白描』見長的。今人曾毅，批評初白，説是『詩學蘇陸，才氣開展，工力純熟，微少藴藉，蓋其書卷少，不能使典，又好議論，專用白描，亦其失也。』我以爲由現代文學眼光看起來，初白之『不能使典』而『專用白描』，正是其特别見長處。關於查之白描文學，暇當另寫專文，此處所要述出的，只是關於他所寫的隨筆『人海記』。　　本來，『萬人如海一身藏』，在都市裏的人們，同有此感。讀人海記，不免且雜拾一番。（一）　　金錢人人愛，固不獨官家爲然。不過在打倒貪官污吏的口號之下，一窮不受幕夜之金』，似乎也是當官兒的本分。不幸『位尊多金』，古今來事同一例，其來路當然不出於賄賂一途。至於美其名曰餽贈的，受者和授者態度，各有不同，有『君子不可以貨取』的孟軻；又有『天知地知你知我知』的楊震。但是我覺得他們那些態度雖然都很對，似乎還不及人海記的一件故事，更覺可人！　　人海記下卷『郤餽茶葉』一則云··　　鄭端簡公曉官文選時，里中仕宦有餽金首飾者，承篚，而以茗覆其上。直以爲茗也受之。其夫人乎撥茗，知之，面頸發赤，亟傳柝請公入，以語公。公不動聲色，第令覆茗如初，徐出，召其人，還之。謂曰··『吾初以家適乏茗，故拜君惠，頃入內詢之，家尚有餘茗。心謝，尊意不敢當也。』遂令持歸。　　這是一件多麽可人的故事，妙在不動聲色的原封不動，尤妙在其夫人手撥茗，知之，面頸發赤，而亟傳柝請公。我不知今日非貪官污吏的在大位者，如果遇到這様的事，將怎麽様去處置？其房中有新知識的摩登夫人，面頸發赤不發赤？卽不傳柝而打電話，電話裏又將怎麽説？或者竟連電話也不打一個，亦未可知！（二）　　這幾年以來，書坊裏似乎需要愛國英雄故事什麽的，因此有不少我國的古代英雄，新近都被人用白話　寫了一　。我也曾經替老　們寫過　繼光和史可法的故事，搜羅　不少舊籍，不幸却遺漏了下面兩段。　　關於戚繼光的，人海記中有一段云··　　　『戚少保繼光，鎭薊門，駐三屯營最久，經　周詳，殁後，有祠。總兵尤繼先到任不拜祠。除夕，公庫災，獨題梁及銀牌存，題梁年月，少保所書，繼先數戚公神人也，刑牲以祭』。　　這雖然是偶然的一回事，不足據爲神奇，却是歷史上　有這様敷會之説的很多用來嚇嚇尤繼先那一班人，未始不是趣事。　　關於史可法的··『儀徵陳延　先生題史可法手製砲云··　　『昔之用砲也，以敵愾而勤王；今之用砲也，將以殺夫蚩蚩之氓。嗟無知之頑鐵，胡有時而不祥？願存此千秋忠義之物，以示彼猛如虎狼如羊貪如狼者』！搂晚公手製砲欵識云，『崇禎甲由年三月，南京兵部正堂史』舊藏公祠中，祠久駐兵，坦壁薪木俱燬，砲幸無恙，殆公靈爽默佑歟！一則曰題梁獨存，一則曰砲幸無恙，都是給後人做紀念的佳話，我們在今日摭拾前人故事而傳記之，關於這一類的材料，也是很珍貴的。（三）　　『美人絕世原妖物』，這是前人詠綠珠的詩，其實妖物何止綠珠一個。孫秀和石崇爭的是綠珠，吳三桂和李自成爭的是吾家圓圓。丨按此係仿ＸＸＸ稱吾家太炎，ＸＸＸ稱吾家適之而來。不料圓圓之後，又有一個金陵陳妓，惹得王謝兩家大鬧爭奪的風潮。陳妓原是楚撫宋一鶴的妾，一鶴敗没，門客王屋與貴陽謝參政爭娶之。人海記載和奎絕句云··　　『歌舞　中度歲華，一朝忽散抱琵琶。前身定是烏衣燕，不入王家卽謝家。』　　這雖然帶一點文字游戲的意味，却是給爭女色者以莫大的敎訓，小燕兒一般的女子，一會兒飛到王家，一會兒又飛到謝家，有幾個眞是啣泥尋故主的多情燕子呀！初次上火綫  渾　　這是石生七年前軍隊生活的一頁。　　那年秋天，某軍由他鄕間經過，沿途招募新兵；他就應募充當一名新兵了。因爲某軍急於要回Ｘ省去，部隊用强行軍的速度在行進中，所以他補到連上，雖説約莫有一個月了；但是一面動作，一面喊着『一二一二』的訓練，還没正式受過一次。一天，營長用命令式的口氣向各連士兵報告··『現在敵人祇隔二十里，明天天亮，我們開始向敵人攻擊。今晚三點鐘吃飯，四點鐘集合，四點半鐘出發，攻擊前進，大家好好凖備着！』石生聽着營長的報告，知道明天要上火綫　　了，低着頭獨自默想··假如一粒子彈打來，中着腦壳，或是身上其他要害處，豈不是性命會要送掉了嗎？就是打斷了一隻手，一條腿，做半世殘廢人，這苦楚也難受。他想到這裏，幾乎渾身發抖，大悔不該來當兵的。在晚飯後他找着鴉片烟鬼王得勝問道··　　『上火綫，有没有法子不受危險？』王得勝在這一連士兵中資格算最老，參加過大小戰鬥不下十次。他每一次聽見槍聲響了，就找一個安全地方躱着，他看見有打死了的，不論是敵人或是自己這一邊的人，京去搜摸他身上的手錶戒指等東西；所以他遇到上火綫時，暗中還格外喜歡。他聽見新兵石生這様問他，照例的回答一聲··『有什麽危險，砲彈不打長命人的。』　　石生仍是放心不下，在一支燃着的臘燭光下，把自己家內地址，詳細寫在一張紙條上，藏在貼身口袋內。他以爲如果明天打死了，有一個址，也好以後由官長把欠餉和撫卹金寄到他家內去。　　天空微微的發光，長蛇様的隊伍在山巒起伏的蓬蒿蔓草內爬着前進；無數的鋭利槍刺在灰暗中擺動。每一個人的耳朶聽着，眼睛望着，心內想着，在希望敵人出現。但是石生的兩條腿，却彷彿綁了石頭様，用盡氣力纔提得起來，心頭也愈走愈跳得厲害。　　劈拍的聲浪逐漸展開到漫山遍野了。鳴丨鳴丨吱丨吱丨，石生遵着班長的話，蹲在　溝內，端着槍向着槍聲響得最密的，或是樹林內竪关戰旗在飄蕩着的地方開始射擊。　　砰丨砰丨，一股一股濃濃的黑烟在空中滾着。　　『王班長，這是那一邊的大砲？』石生問着。　　『這是我們的砲兵營轟擊敵人的機關槍陣地。』石生聽着，於是又放心繼續射擊。　　嗒丨嗒嗒，機關槍火花左右掃射着，砲彈爆炸隆隆聲散到無邊際的遠處了。王班長剛把頭從　溝內抬起來瞭望，撲的一聲下嘴唇打脱了，鮮血淋淋；四眼狗張標腦蓋骨打破了，倒裁葱似的死在血地裏；還有老郭，斜倚在一　堆背面，呻吟着要一點水喝。這一切一切慘不忍暏的血肉飛舞情狀，都一一映在石生腦膜上，他正悲憤無地的時候，忽聽見連長拿着手槍高聲喊着··『士兵同志們！現在我們不消滅敵人，我們就要被敵人消滅了，大家衝鋒前進吧！　　號兵吹着··『多多地，多多地』。『殺呵！殺呵！』　　石生也血紅着臉，毫不畏縮地灣关腰跑步衝向前去了。病囚雜記  嘯龍　　（七）家人的探望一般監獄對於囚犯的家人的探望，是有一定的時間的限制的。我們的病院也没有兩様。不過時間是寛得多。照例是每天下午一時至三時，和晚上七時至八時。過了這個時候，那些看護們便會和那些獄卒一様，毫不客氣地請你出去的。所以這每天的三個鐘頭，在每一個病人看來，都是最可寳貴的。一個病者的寂寞的心情，和那一種需要安慰的迫切，在這裏是毫不掩飾地表示出來了。　　我們四個中，那個小孩子的母親來得最多。我想大槪是因爲他是小孩子，所以特别允許她吧。另一個理由，恐怕也是因『面子』之故，因爲他的母親也是和病院裏的人認識的。她每天必多來一次，便是在上午八九點鐘的時候。她來便給她的孩子喂飯，洗臉等。她不特爲了她的孩子，還時時帮忙我們。這個身材瘦小的婦人，是仁慈而良善的。每次她要走的時候，她的孩子必得大哭一塲，她也必得用種種的方法來哄騙他，才得脱身。這一種情形，誰看見了也要感動的。銀行行員的親友來看的，大槪算最多了。他的夫人（如果我没有猜錯），每天總按了時間來，替他把那不曾恢復了知覺的手按摩着。有時候一兩句安慰的話，有時候是一兩句滿充了憐愛的輕輕的責駡，卽如在他不當心地要把身體移動着，或是没有把被蓋好的時候。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言『國際原則瓊聲』  瓊聲　　　　日本自四月十七日發表關於對華政策聲明，以傲慢的態度，反對其他各國對華襄助的『不友好行爲』，儼然想獨霸東亞，視中國若禁　；這一顆炸彈擲諸角逐於太平洋的列强間，登時轟動全球，火花　裂。英國對日本之『對華不染指』表示拒絕於前，四月二十九日美向日提出反對東亞門羅主義的正式照會，最近日本駐法大使佐藤會晤法外長巴爾都時，巴爾都亦一再説尊重中國獨立與列强條約權利，重申九國公約第七條的意議。　　狡　的木屐朋友，看見形勢不佳，於是擊鈴自解，由廣田答覆英美大使説十七日聲明並未『正式存在』，表明撤消了對華宣言的意旨。出爾反爾，以外交負責員人而竟被迫得自掌其頰，何以致此？據廣田的談話説，日本尊重中華民國的主權，無在任何情勢下侵犯中國主權的意志，並不違反門户開放政策，亦遵重各國在華的條約與權利，這是甚麽？廣田言此乃日本極欲遵守的『國際原則』。　　國際原則是甚麽？是在華府會議時中國所爭得名爲保持中國領土主權完整，實則純爲國際市塲之『次殖民地』的賣身契；所謂機會均等門户開放，就是不許任何列强獨佔，也不讓任何列强被排擠之眞意的解釋。惟聰明的侵略者，於囊括東北四省未感饜足之餘，利用歐洲多事，北美無力，而且各國爭議正多的時候，企圖打破這一均勢，當然是想打破這一『國際原則』了，因之我們可以警告倡合作言親善的人們，『國際原則』正是中國民族的鐐銬絕不能將這一『原則』看作靈符，背着牠向各處請求來圖存。事實上告訴我們，是不可能的我們旣不願人家把鐵鳥軍艦來打破此國際原則，只有我們自己用民族革命戰爭的方式來粉碎這一『國際原則』，才能爭得中國民族的眞正獨立。科學靈乩及其他  席珍　　　偉大的時輪金剛法會，究竟偉大到什麽地步，我們無從猜想；然而神聖的黃色的風吹到了上海，在靈滿了煤烟，垃圾與脂粉的都市中，雖然不及西湖靈隱的淸稚莊嚴，但偶而走到街上，也能看到街頭巷尾的報灘上，書灘上，滑頭書店門口，小販的手中，洋襪寛緊帶攤上附設的『寄售部』，全是密盛盛地掛出了一張張的神聖的黃色的東西，上面印了半部排成圓圓形的『學生字典』又在圓圈的中央放了一個三分像人，七分像鬼的歪臉，（據説這也是近代的一種最大的發明），還有黃色的標語··『完全科學方法』，『破除迷信』，『靈不靈一試便知』，『三分鐘人鬼通話』，最後是··『科學靈乩每份祇售大洋二角』　本來上海人眼裏看的，心裏想的，夢裏做的，全以黃色爲主，對於這全黃色的『完全科學化』，的東西大約是不會厭惡到那裏去的，從『極一時之盛』的狀態上看來，它底銷路至少也得比『子夜』多賣出五六倍。大學生，中學生，小學生，小姐，奶奶，娘姨與包車夫，莫不人手一篇。而據説它底功用也實在大得可以；化了二角大洋，上則可以問問國運的盛衰（有人從科學靈乩中請到了一個鬼，問他中日的前途如何，回答説是日本的猖狂，是一個定數，暫時抖一下子，不久天神天將就會下來收拾他們的；而且説中國是個堂堂的大國，犯不着和這種蠻子去爭短長，聽其自滅可也。我疑心是請到了阿Ａ的靈魂，想請魯迅先生把阿Ａ　的生年死月及時辰八字抄出來，預備給他在時輪金剛法會中設一個長生祿位。）；次之也不妨問問下一期的航空獎劵的頭獎號碼，再化上十塊錢去買他一個整張來，關起門預備拿五十萬（這筆交易大約還值得一做吧？）下焉者至少也可以請一請『奇俠張玖琯』來問問明天早筒的花會，就是當了被單也得去打上一塊錢，到明天下午便三十五白花洋錢一個月的房飯錢全不用愁了。二毛錢一份的科學靈乩，功用實在比十五個銅子一包的老牌人丹大得多··人本來是聰明的動物，而况是特别指定的『二十世紀』的人類，便宜的交易不幹才是頭等優子哩。上海也究竟是個黃金的都市；從前有人聽説倫敦遍地是金沙，便不遠千里的步行到倫敦，結果是上了一個大當，而我們現在儘可放心膽大的拍着胸部對人家説，上海滿牆都是金錢··十元換五十萬，一元換三十五，『多則類推』；而科學的發逹到了這個地步，也的確可以説是科學的莫大的光榮了。　　可是財是人人要發的，我們『爲避免擁擠起見，不得不略加限止』，航空獎劵每條一元，寫明是人人可得的，可是拿不出一塊錢的人就不可得了；而『科學靈乩』的攤子前面，也儘多袋子裏連一個銅子都不剩的面黃飢瘦的人圍着看熱鬧哩。　　這世界終究是好玩的，每天有無數的『新的演出』給人消受，給人欣賞；然而就在這『金剛法會』與『科學靈乩』的熱鬧聲中，我們竟看到秦氏一門嘆着『好種不留』而尋求那最後的擺脱了。對於這，我們能説什麽呢？觀江灣賽會後  吉三　　　　今年本是兒童年，又是婦女國貨年，這在去年早已議訂的。近來似乎又添加了一個『神鬼年』（？）了丨　　可不是嗎？自淸明節到現在，那久已爲政府所認爲不良風俗而明令禁止，沉寂已久的迎神賽會提燈游行等種種集會，忽風糜一時，不約而同，先先後後地，萬人空巷的熱烈舉行，儀仗的爭奇鬥勝，光怪陸離；信士的拈香拱拜，架犯游行；若非此不足以威悦神鬼，不足以自　隱愆；不爲神明所保佑，而國泰民安，五穀豐登者然。看了江灣東嶽廟劉三爺的所謂出巡··參加者有五萬之衆，前往觀賞者不下二十萬人，甚至有上寳南通等縣也有儀仗彩排，列隊游行，眞可謂空前盛舉，可見民衆對於固有習俗之熱烈一般　　記起四月四·五·六三日滬西蓬塲廟出燈，據熟識內幕之友人謂··那次光是點燈·待佛·伙食·搭置燈彩等費用，共計十數萬元，若以民衆之香燭及零星消耗併入計算，不下二三十萬元，如此無意義的消費，輕舉妄動，雖然是民衆娛樂之一法，終是有多少迷信舉動，且屬勞民傷財，的是不良習俗，如中央</p>

<p>電影專刊　　中華民國貳拾參年伍月拾伍日星期貳ＴｈｅＳｂｎｎＰａｏＳｃｒｅｅｎＳｅｃｔｉｏｎ葛雷泰嘉寳受人崇敬的一斑（下）  西林　　　　這是個很奇怪的事實，就是許多明星們，和葛雷泰嘉寳在同一公司裏服務的，他們都和這位瑞典怪女星没有見過一面。卽以雷門諾伐羅而論，他的攝影塲就在嘉寳的隔壁，他的化妝室，離開嘉寳的化妝室不過幾步，但是他們二人在六年之中，從來没有看見過，直等到他們合演ＭａｔａＨａｒｉ。魯意斯史東曾和嘉寳合拍過許多戲，但是他自己曾向友人説過，他除掉爲完成拍影片的任務，和嘉寳接洽之外，並未和她交換過私人的談話。嘉寳對於一般崇拜她的人，是不過問而不在她心上的。好萊塢並没有什麽擁護嘉寳的會社。嘉寳亦從來没有對於她的擁護者發表過什麽談話。她從來没有回復過一封她的擁護者的信，亦没有簽過一張相片送給她的擁護者。可是任何誰的擁護者，都難和嘉寳擁護者的熱誠愛戴相比擬。擁戴嘉寳者的熱誠，可以説近乎狂顚了。　　要是一家電影雜誌，對於這位嘉寳發表了什麽不恭維的言論，它馬上就會接得無數抗議的信扎的。你要是看了那種信，你一定以爲你犯了什麽大不敬或褻　的罪了。英雄崇拜没有那様的熱烈。宗敎狂熱，亦没有那様眞誠。有一位無綫電播送者在無線電裏，説了幾句對於嘉寳略致詼諧的話。他明天一天就接到了五百封唾駡他的信。　　供獻是敬神的一種表示。嘉寳亦是常受人家供奉的。幾年以前，有一個不知姓名的人，每天送她一束外國所認爲最名貴的蘭花，呌Ｏｒｃｈｉｄｓ的。匣子上有一家花店的名字，但是從花店調查。他們都不知道那買花的人是誰。嘉寳每天接到了，也置之不問。有人向她説，可以設法阻止的，但是嘉寳説··『讓他去好了。各求其心之所安，或者他這様才心安呢？一後來她發現了那送花的人，是地屈洛意一個富有的律師，她馬上就不再接受了。後來那位律師又寄給她一張她的書像請她簽字。她簽了。那位律師是多末幸運呀，因爲她是很少簽字送给人的。天下各處送给她禮物的人眞多，但她一槪原封不動的璧返了。她祇愛些鮮花，尤以那種名貴的蘭花爲最多。　　從葛雷泰的眼光看起來，世界上　無論什麽人，没有什麽重要不重要的。當瑞典王太子遊歷美國的時候，他因爲本國出了這様一位大明星，要想和她見見，但她竟不加以延見。美國人所認爲當代最偉大的一位新聞家來到了好萊塢。他和约翰巴里摩亞是朋友，因此他到攝影塲來訪問他，看他拍戲。那時嘉寳正和巴里摩亞拍着『大飯店。』忽然間嘉寳停止了。他走到巴里摩亞的面前，對他説道··『約翰，對不起得很，我們等一等再拍戲吧。』她説完了就回頭向着她的妝化室去了。巴里摩亞追上去説道··『那是亞塞爾勒里斯本，是世界上最有名的新聞主筆著作家一嘉寳道··『但是，約翰，你想勃里斯本先生在執筆作文的時候，願意我走到他的公事房裏，從他肩膀上看他作文章嗎？』她這類的事情很多。她拍戲的時候，向來不許生人那兒旁觀的。米高梅公司裏許多重要的職員，都没有看見過她拍過戲。她的怪僻旣如此，而能受人的崇拜又如彼，其所以然的奥妙，始終没有人猜得透也。（完）影片談評『眞好女子』評  羅平　　　　ＴｈａｔｓａＧｏｏｄＧｉｒｌ　　丨南京　　像患了懷鄕病似的，當那無聊的胡鬧的一切，觸進我的眼　，在黑暗中差不多是枯坐了兩個鐘頭。　　　我默默地坐着，對於『眞好女中』中的不自然的歌唱，淺薄無聊的跳踉，矯揉造作的笑聲，我還能説什麽話才好呢？　　故事是説一個欠了許多債的人，要去繼承他叔父的鉅萬的遺產，在旅邸中愛上了一個女人。那是這様的空虚，我　　們絕對不能從這裏看到一點社會背景，也不能看到劇中人的個性，歌曲，舞蹈，跳跟，便是『眞好女子』的一切。　　對白，歌聲，一字或一句地入了我們的耳膜，意義，我們懂得，但是到最後，我們却不會明白這裏講的是些什麽！　　莫明其妙的跳起來，莫明其妙的唱起來，莫明其妙的追和逃起來，莫明其妙的吵起來，全部的膠片都給這些無聊的造作所佔據去了。　　然而，果如所宣傳的那様新鮮，還有可説；但一貫的英國的音樂喜劇的老調，跌，打，擲破瓶子，舞臺上鬧笑話，大團圓的結束，那一切，都　是陳舊的而不免令人厭倦的。　　那二個人的談談唱唱，擠眉弄眼，跳跳追追，眞有點像中國的雙簧，然而，很不幸，便是這種雙簧式的滑稽佔去了『眞好女子』的全部，假使這些在有聲電影的初期，自然也有其存在的意義，在今天，我們也没有話好説的了。　　　賈克卜淦南的以前的一張『桃李芬芳』，是多少可取的，然而『眞好女子』是遠不如的，主演導演，都是賈克，這　　個劇本，根本只是爲池他個人的胡鬧而寫的。　　他不但不能和希佛萊相等，只能説和華爾塞惠爾勒殊途同歸，一様的無聊丨『互助』提出的一個問題  胡越　　　　『互助』雖然被上海的電影觀衆與影評人輕輕的放過了，但是，正如什麽地方説過的，它之在三十年代的勞動節與中國觀衆相見，其意義是很嚴肅的。　　在柏勃斯德的沈鬱雄奇的『筆觸』下，我們是被那偉大的民衆的倫理觀念，和推倒人類間厚壁的國際主義感動了。自然，如『亡命者』那様，『互助』是一部粗獚的率直的而不是雅緻的精巧的作品，而且因爲製作時期的早在一九三一所，被當時一般的技術水凖所限制，部分的檢討起來，有幾許地方是可疵議的。　　我們又要注意到本刋三位執筆者的合評中所提到的缺點；『互助』如果能把其主題更深化，就是説，如果更寫實一些，那麽民族的偏見與地底的壁壘是誰造起來的一點，也可以告訴我們了。現在，這裏有的是對於這種牆壁的驚嘆與憤怒而在相差僅是一紙的地方便中止了。　　還有使我們感動的，德法礦工在語言不通中握手的困難的描寫。『互助』的各方面，差不多都有人批評到，但是這一點，注意的人却少。我們且搬開這部紀錄電影的其他方面不説，這個民衆間怎様密切握起手來的問題，顯然的，我們不應該忽視的，『互助』恰正嚴重的提出了這個問題。　　我們相信，每一個觀衆，看到被困的德國工人在言語不通時的燥急焦慮，都立刻刻感覺到這是一個非常嚴重的問題。可是，『互助』的提出了這個問題，似乎還没人注意到。　　帝國主義的分化政策，在各地的民衆間造丐了民族僣家的高牆，更以言語來築成了厚壁。隔斷了民族與民族間情愫的交通。　　我們在『互助』中，覺到了我們需要一種世界各民族所能共同應用的語言。當然世界語有相當的價值和造就，但是它在東方的勢力，還極薄弱。將來是否能有一種眞正的ＵｎｉｖｅｒｓａｌＬａｎｇｕａｇｅ出來，却是一個很有意義的問題。　　葛蘿利亞史璜孫不久將重返銀幕  馥　　　　老牌風騷明星葛蘿利亞史璜孫，自從多年以前一念之差，要想生兒育女而作賢妻良母，放棄了銀幕生涯之後，忽忽已若干年了。她雖没有爲一般健忘的觀衆所完全忘却，但年華易逝，要想重返銀幕，度其燦爛生涯，却已覺得難乎其難了。不過她重返銀之心甚切，奮鬥亦極力。到了現在，有志者事竟成，消息傳來，她已贏行了米高梅當局的同情，而給了她一個合同。米高梅公司正爲她尋覓適當民本事，據云最近已經選定了伊琳諾爾格林所著的，三星期了。米高梅本來是衆星匯萃之地。現在已有的一斑女星，如葛雷泰嘉寳瑙希拉，瓊克勞馥，漢倫海斯，曼琳黛維絲等，已不一而足。現在又添了一個史璜孫，當然是很足慶幸的。不過她已是個半老徐娘，不宜於再飾少女，將來究意有多少號召力，還須拭目以視也。好萊塢的離結婚統計  東林　　　　許多人都説，去处卽一九三三年是好萊塢之最大的離婚年。可是據統計告訴我們，去年不過只有二十五對男女的離婚，而却有三十一對男女的結婚。但是一九三二年却有三十七對男女的離婚和三十二對男女的結婚。　　我們並不需要，用百分法亦可以知道，一九三三年離婚的次數，的確比一九三二年，减少了不少，可是人們爲什麽不説，一九三二年，是最大的離婚年呢？　　這是因爲，去年中有兩個月在好萊塢是接連的有人離婚着，而這離婚的主角都是影界之大人物的緣故呀！電影小說歡喜寃家（二）  隴耕　　　　王玉和，一個機關裏的科員，一個没有了父母的飄零人。他愛桂英，他眞情地愛桂英。他曾經把一束鮮花帶着他熱的眞情，呈獻予桂英。桂英雖然剛受過一下新的刺激而正在痛惡一切的男人，可是，這抹不了她靑春的熱情。王玉和的眞情，於是掉換得桂英的愛　　在濟才的家，在玉和家的園裏，在花的包圍裏，他們開始了他們『愛』的甜蜜的陶醉和享受了。白桂英又像是一枝枯殘了的玫瑰，復又開放着它深紅色的花瓣了。　　可是，王玉和的姑丈，是不允許他的熱情，在一個女戲子身上燃燒，來辱没他家的門風。他説唱戲是不正當的職業，同時，他侮辱了一切唱戲的人。丨雖然，白桂英已唱戲了。然而，王玉和不能没有情感。他解釋，他懇求，他要姑丈了解，他要姑丈允許他愛白桂英。可是，姑丈是頑固的，他使勁地擊着桌子，命令王玉和，如果你要愛她，你就離開這裏。　　愛是犧牲的。王玉和不能爲了姑丈的攔阻，中斷了他烈燄般的愛，他預備忍痛地脱離姑丈，他堅决地離開這裏了。　　可是，白桂英是在門外，把一切都聽明白了。她攔住要出走的王玉和，他勸玉和服從他姑丈的訓言，她願意玉和忘記了她，她願意犧牲了她的愛來成全玉和姑丈的感情，她又是一朶偉大的玫瑰。　　然而，王玉和是始終愛白桂英的，他是勇敢地堅决地脱離了姑丈之家，而來到白桂英這裏，要追回他神聖的愛。　　　白桂英的少女的心，現在是開始彷徨，他愛玉和，然而她又不能親近玉和。同時，桂英的娘，又苛求桂英回復她的舞臺生涯。　　娘的苛求她是忿氣的拒絕了。她明白她不能再過她的唱戲生活了。她的拒絕，是希望她不再得到人們的瞧不起，然而，她將怎様來回答可愛又可憐的王玉和呢？　　熱烈的情感終於是突破了理智。白桂英大膽地，從容地，握起王玉和的手走『愛的實現』之路了。　　曾經把自殺來要挾她頑固的娘的允許她嫁給王玉和，爲着白桂英的娘是卑視玉和做『小科員』，『窮光蛋』，而堅决地不准許他們的結合。這結果是在程秋雲的帮助之下，竟圓滿了。　　可是，進一步的不幸，突然襲進了活躍着的二人之間。王玉和爲了籌備婚事，誤了要公而被撤職了（未完）</p>

Gu Weijun represented China at the Executive Council and the China Technical Cooperation Committee. China did not attend the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee because it is not a member of the committee. It is believed that after the meeting, the international community's non-recognition of the puppet state will be further strengthened. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3>Japan Watches the Progress, Worried About the Maneuvering of Chinese Representatives and Small Countries, Especially Deeply Concerned About League of Nations Technical Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Council will meet in Geneva for a week starting today. The Sino-Japanese Incident Advisory Committee and the Committee on Technical Assistance to China will also meet at the same time. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese problem and the Manchurian problem will again be the focus of discussion. The Japanese diplomatic authorities attach great importance to this and intend to monitor the maneuvering of the Chinese representatives and small countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that (1) the Sino-Japanese Incident Advisory Committee will not convene the subcommittees on non-recognition of "Manchukuo" and the embargo on weapons to China and Japan this time, but will only put on the agenda the issue of calculating the transit fees for Manchurian mail proposed by the British government. The committee will inevitably take one of the following two paths regarding this matter: either it will decide on the calculation method in a form that does not conflict with the resolution on non-recognition of "Manchukuo," or it will evade responsibility by transferring it to the Universal Postal Union for decision, fearing that the result will de facto be equivalent to recognizing "Manchukuo." (2) The Committee on Technical Assistance to China will discuss based on Dr. Raciman's report. Next, representatives from Britain and France, etc., may ask rather profound questions about whether aid to China is like Japan's unofficial statement on its China policy, interfering in China's internal affairs. As a result, it may be passed with conditions that more strictly fulfill the scope of technical assistance. It is also unknown whether Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, etc., will attack Japan in the same way as at the General Assembly last September. At a time when Japan's unofficial statement on its China policy was made on April 17, it may cause unexpected waves. Therefore, the Japanese authorities are extremely vigilant about the trend of the committee.</p>

<h3>Arima Returns Next Week with New Instructions from Hirota, a Fundamental Policy Toward China Has Been Decided, and Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations Will Be Induced</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) According to diplomatic circles, American-Chinese-Japanese Minister Arima Ming is determined to leave Beijing for Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. Minister Arima has repeatedly consulted with Foreign Minister Hirota in Tokyo, and it is said that opinions on China have been largely agreed upon. It is said that his attitude towards China should be as follows: (1) Strive to awaken the Chinese government's attention to peace in East Asia and demand that the Chinese government begin direct negotiations with Japan, and not decide its policy towards Japan by watching the attitudes of the League of Nations and the United States. If the Chinese government still ignores Japan's wishes and does not show sincerity in a short period of time, the Japanese government will implement its original plan and take decisive action to awaken the Chinese government. (2) Vigorously promote the area in North China where Japan has special rights and interests, and start working on Sino-Japanese economic relations from North China. The Japanese plan can also be actively carried out in the Yangtze River and South China at the same time to restore the Japanese goods market in China. (3) On the issue of traffic and postal services, Japan will never change the established original plan. After Arima returns to his post, he will negotiate with the Chinese side as soon as possible according to the original plan. (4) After the unofficial statement on April 17, the anti-Japanese atmosphere in various countries has eased slightly, so we can hold new hope for carrying out the various tasks mentioned above. (China United Press dispatch on the 14th)</p>

The Holy See also hopes that the two sides will officially send representatives soon so that they can contact each other at any time. Moreover, the Holy See considers Nanjing to be the capital of China and one of the important international regions, so it plans to add a new diocese in Beijing as the first district in China.

<p>Liu Wenhui Cables Report of Repulsing Sneaking Tibetan Troops</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui cabled yesterday that Tibetan troops attempting to cross the border were repulsed by Sichuan troops. According to Mai Juezhongni of the Tibetan Office in Beijing, since the passing of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan government has become increasingly inclined towards the Central Government. All disputes regarding the Kang-Tibetan region are handled in accordance with the Central Government's intentions. The senior officials dispatched by the Central Government have already set out for Tibet, and the Tibetan side is preparing to welcome them. At a time when relations between China and Tibet are gradually improving, the Tibetan side would definitely not take such disruptive actions. The Central Government has not received any reports from Tibet regarding Liu Wenhui's cable to Beijing, and the truth is still difficult to ascertain. Yu Ba urgently telegraphed Xiamen to inquire about everything in detail, and a clear understanding should be available within ten days. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance Rejects Hubei Province's Request to Levy a Salt Surcharge</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Hubei Provincial Government requested that the central government's original subsidy of 200,000 yuan per month to the province be changed to a special education fund, allocated from the Hubei salt tax, and that a surcharge of two jiao be levied on each dan of Hubei salt tax to subsidize education in the recovered communist areas. The Executive Yuan submitted this to the Ministry of Finance for review. The Ministry of Finance stated that when the likin was abolished, the Ministry had allocated a monthly subsidy of 200,000 yuan to Hubei Province, which had been disbursed monthly. If Hubei Province deems educational expenses important, it can independently earmark and store the amount allocated by the national treasury for dedicated use, without needing to reallocate it from the salt tax, which would affect the original purpose of the salt tax. Furthermore, since the National Government explicitly ordered that the salt tax be collected by the Ministry, provinces should not levy any surcharges under any name. The request to levy two jiao per dan on Hubei salt tax is clearly inconsistent with the National Government's order. In addition, the Hubei salt tax rate has already been adjusted, with the tax rate of ten yuan or more reduced to ten yuan, originally to reduce the burden. Therefore, it is inappropriate to consider increasing it again. Based on this, the Ministry of Finance rejected the request from the Hubei Provincial Government. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

He has instructed the military authorities to study the policy and exchanged views with Nagai Taku and others. As a result, it was decided that the most urgent tasks to be implemented first are stabilizing hearts and minds and developing industry in "Manchukuo." The Kwantung Army considers its first task of restoring order to be nearing completion. It also recognizes the necessity of implementing the second task of stabilizing hearts and minds. The Army has ordered the Kwantung Army Headquarters to vigorously assist "Manchukuo" in establishing local administration, thoroughly popularizing education, and attracting Japanese capital to "Manchukuo" to develop industry.

<p>The Alps No Longer an Impenetrable Fortress: Switzerland Expands Self-Defense Military Preparations</p>
<p>Adding Eighty Aircraft to Enhance Air Defense, Hoping to Remain Neutral in the Next Great War</p>
<p>(Geneva) Switzerland is now also joining the arms race. The Swiss government is deeply worried about the failure of the disarmament conference and the recurrence of a European war. Fearing its country's being invaded, it has now decided to allocate 82 million francs to modernize its military equipment, including 46.2 million francs to purchase artillery and ammunition, and another 12 million francs to purchase eighty aircraft. Switzerland's actions are purely for self-defense and precautionary purposes, as it hopes to remain neutral in the next European war. However, unconfirmed reports claim that Germany plans to pass through Switzerland to attack southern France. The Swiss government is greatly disturbed and has decided to take the above-mentioned actions. The newly allocated funds will be distributed over twenty-five years, so Switzerland can obtain new military equipment to defend against any enemy invasion. Switzerland relies on the natural barrier of the Alps and is confident that its existing military strength is sufficient to resist any invasion before foreign aid arrives. Switzerland is surrounded by mountains, so before the invention of aircraft, it was as secure as a rock. However, today, the rivers and mountains remain, but the situation is completely different. With France to the west, Germany to the north, Italy to the south, and Austria to the east, the Swiss are deeply afraid that the next air war may affect Switzerland. The fear of aircraft bombing and the spreading of poisonous gas has made Switzerland eager to remain neutral in the next European war. Furthermore, Switzerland is a federation with a mix of French, German, and Italian ethnic groups, so it is impossible to take sides. Therefore, Switzerland's expansion of military equipment is purely a security plan to prevent neighboring countries from attacking other countries through Switzerland. Switzerland already has one hundred and twenty-five aircraft and now plans to add another eighty new aircraft. This action indicates that the Swiss people firmly believe that they must defend against aerial attacks. The government has not yet adopted a public plan to protect residents from aerial or poisonous attacks. Switzerland has not been as noisy as most European countries about training in the use of gas masks. Switzerland has five major cities that could be targeted for bombing by enemy countries. The largest of these is Zurich, the center of Swiss commerce. Next is Bern, the capital of Switzerland, with a population of 111,000. The city is adjacent to both France and Germany, so it feels quite uneasy. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>French Hegemony Wavers, Old Entente Crumbles, New Alliances Are Treacherous</p>
<p>(London) Post-war Europe is now showing its cracks again. The current panorama of Europe is like a vast ice field. When the spring sunshine shines, fissures appear everywhere. Today, the sounds of diplomatic thunder are deafening. The old Entente is falling apart, and some ice floes have drifted away with the waves, while others are sinking to form new groups. The Treaty of Versailles came at the cost of sacrificing ten million lives in the World War. Although a few people still want to maintain this self-defeating treaty, both victors and losers alike generally acknowledge that Versailles has created a great mistake unprecedented in history. Therefore, the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, which were born with this treaty, have long been regarded as failures. Today, the Treaty of Versailles is seen as loose sand. The post-war European political system is indeed based on it and serves as a tool for the victorious countries to permanently control the defeated countries. Turkey was the first country to counterattack this. Only four years after the Western Front armistice, Kemal launched a military campaign that inflicted a major defeat on Greece, freeing Turkey from the shackles of the Treaty of Lausanne. Nine years later, Japan, far from the European battlefield, exposed the League of Nations' inability to sanction powerful countries. Germany has long harbored grievances, so it overthrew its rulers and took a further step to resist the current European system. Hitler has jumped to power, and his first diplomatic move was to announce Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Hitler also publicly demanded equality in armaments and is now moving forward bravely, seeking to restore his military power. The current facts are clear: Germany will inevitably restore its armaments and reject the control of its former enemies. At the same time, Britain, Italy, and other countries recognize that Germany should no longer be considered a second-class country, so the foundation of Versailles has begun to shake. European diplomats now know that Germany's military power will exceed that of France in the coming years. France's wartime allies are now unwilling to be drawn into the vortex again and are becoming increasingly alienated. Italy is dissatisfied with France because it has gained nothing in the settlement of Mediterranean and colonial issues. Britain is unwilling to make additional guarantees to France. Poland has also directly signed a non-aggression treaty with Germany, weakening France's diplomatic influence in Europe. Belgium, which borders France, also took similar steps in March, indicating a reconciliation with Germany. France's position in Central Europe and Southeastern Europe is thus wavering. As for the Little Entente, it is also showing signs of disintegration. Czechoslovakia plans to sign a non-aggression treaty with Hitler, as does Yugoslavia. Romania has also hinted at this intention, fearing that Italy's influence over Austria will be even greater than Germany's, so it is urging them to reconcile with Germany. The actions of the Little Entente are tantamount to removing the firewood from under the cauldron, undermining France's dominant position in Europe. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Mussolini Explains Reasons for Expanding Navy: To Develop Towards Africa and the Far East</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's naval affairs reporter, Pei Waite, met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss the Italian naval issue. The Italian Prime Minister explained to him why Italy must establish a strong navy: "More than thirty Italian provinces are on the coast, and the capital Rome is not far from the sea. Geographical location is enough to determine the fate of a nation. This is an unchangeable fact." When discussing international issues, Mussolini said, "The principle that the League of Nations must be reorganized has been recognized by the whole world. However, reorganization can only be implemented after a disarmament treaty is concluded. If a disarmament treaty cannot be concluded, the League of Nations is equivalent to bankruptcy. What is there to reorganize?" It is generally recognized that the Disarmament Conference is about to fail, at least in its main objectives. Countries that have already established armaments are unwilling to reduce them, while countries that have not established armaments will reorganize their defensive armaments. Under such circumstances, what is there to talk about disarmament?" Speaking of Italian colonial issues, the Italian Prime Minister said that Italy has the right to develop towards Africa and Asia based on its geographical and historical position. Italy is the closest of all Western European countries to these two continents. But the world must not misunderstand Italy's mission. We have no ambitions to invade territory. We only seek cooperation between Italy and the African and Far Eastern peoples based on natural development. Italy believes that the resources of these two continents are inexhaustible, especially Africa. We must find ways to develop them so that these two continents can be closely linked to the civilized world. Italy is confident that it can assume this mission." (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>American Airships Possess Considerable Combat Capability.</p>
<p>After the Miami airship Macon re-entered the exercises, it returned today after completing exercises off the coast of the Caribbean. The combat capability of the Macon has been warmly praised by the commander. Commander Tracy declared that the Macon's performance was impeccable and believed that airships would be effective in wartime. However, other air force experts do not entirely share Mr. Tracy's view, so the United States' airship policy still needs to be studied further. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<p>American Aircraft Sell Well Worldwide: A Prelude to Future War?</p>
<p>(New York) The business director of a major American aircraft company predicted today that 1934 would be one of the best years for aircraft sales. This statement is based on the trend of increased sales both domestically and abroad. The recent declaration by Japan that it does not want American aircraft to be sold in large quantities to China has not had much impact. Furthermore, Japan also purchased aircraft from the United States last year. Moreover, the United States Navy has ordered 1,100 aircraft based on the "Vinson-Trammell" naval act, and the Army also needs to add 1,800 aircraft. Therefore, domestic aircraft manufacturing is already overwhelmed. As for the foreign market, it is also very active. In the past two years, the annual export of aircraft and components has reached a quarter of all American industrial products. Reading the 1933 business record of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation reveals the scope of American aircraft sales in the world market. Last year, the company's aircraft sold well in Soviet Russia, Japan, China, Germany, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Alaska, Australia, Spain, Poland, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Bulgaria, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico, Cuba, El Salvador, Canada, and Turkey. Furthermore, with the depreciation of the US dollar, sales have increased. In the eleven months of 1933, the export of American aircraft and motors totaled 6,402,086 yuan, an increase of 6.7% compared to the total export of 6,001,963 yuan in the previous year. According to statistics, the export amount in 1933 increased by 16% compared to 1932. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>British House of Commons Discusses Troop Strength in Shanghai</p>
<p>(London) Conservative Party member Knox raised the issue of British troops stationed in Shanghai in the House of Commons today, saying that the number of Japanese and French troops stationed in Shanghai is greater than that of British troops. If the United States also increases its troop strength in Shanghai, British troops will be in fourth place. This situation does not seem to be in line with Britain's position in Shanghai. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that he had not received a report from British Ambassador Cadogan regarding the United States' increase in troop strength in Shanghai. He believed that it would be useless to ask the US government about its intentions. The Foreign Secretary did not answer the general question about the strength of British troops in Shanghai. Conservative Party member Moore asked Naval Secretary Monsell whether he had received a report from the British naval attaché in Beijing regarding the United States' desire to increase troop strength in Shanghai. Waters replied that he had not received this report. Moore then asked the Naval Secretary to instruct the naval attaché to report on this matter, as the issue of the United States increasing troop strength in Shanghai has become a general topic of conversation and comment in Shanghai. Waters agreed to consider this point. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Contents of Australian-Japanese Talks: Latham Urges Japan to Declare Non-Armament of South Pacific; Hirota Disagrees to Dispatch Envoy to Australia</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota and Australian Foreign Minister Latham had a long secret talk on the 13th. Various newspapers and news agencies at home and abroad have published or telegraphed the contents of the talks. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, fearing that there might be errors in the external transmission, today afternoon specifically released the contents of the talks to Cardrak, the special correspondent of the Australian news agency who came to Japan with Latham, and asked him to telegraph them to Australian newspapers: (1) Latham asked whether the Japanese Navy had established military equipment in the islands in the South Pacific under mandate and whether there was any intention to establish military equipment in the future. Hirota replied that there was no such fact, and he personally believed that it would be better not to establish military equipment. (2) Latham advised Hirota that it would be better for Japan to rejoin the League of Nations to resolve the "Manchukuo" issue. What was his opinion? Hirota did not answer this question. (3) Hirota asked about Australia's expansion of its navy, what was its intention? Latham replied that it was for self-defense and to deal with the defenses of New Zealand and the Dutch East Indies. (4) Latham asked whether the Japanese government would officially declare that Japan had no intention of arming the mandated islands in the South Pacific to dispel doubts. What was his opinion? Hirota replied that he would consider it. (5) Latham advised Japan to dispatch an envoy to Australia. Hirota hoped to dispatch a commercial officer instead. (14th Chinese Alliance Telegram)</p>
<p>America Will Assist Chile in Economic Competition Against Japan, Seize Cuban Market.</p>
<p>(Washington) Reliable sources announced today that the State Department is currently studying how to assist Chile so that it can compete with Japan in business in the Caribbean. The Chilean Chargé d'Affaires Boro recently made an informal suggestion to the State Department on this matter. Last year, Chile sold beans worth 950,000 pesos to Cuba (each peso is worth about two silver dollars). However, Japan was able to seize most of the Cuban bean market because of Japan's low shipping costs. Currently, the freight rate between Chile's Valparaiso and Cuba's Havana is US$11.50 per ton, while the freight rate between Kobe and Havana is only US$8 per ton. It is said that even the freight rate from Tianjin is two yuan cheaper than that from Chile. The American Grace Line monopolizes shipping between the United States and Chile, and Havana is one of the ports in the route, so a reduction in freight rates would first affect this shipping company. Chile is confident that if it can obtain equal freight rates, its sales of dried beans and radishes will greatly improve. (13th National Telegram)</p>

<p>US Silver Advocates End Spat with Roosevelt, Will Offer New Proposal</p>
<p>Washington - Senate silver faction leaders, concerning the forced passage of the silver coinage bill, and the nationalizing of silver bill, have essentially declared a "truce". Senator Thomas further elaborated his views today, separately stating that if President Roosevelt refuses to accept the silver bill, then the silver faction will re-submit the Dies bill. Some members of Congress now consider the Dies bill dead, however, believe that the Senate committee can resurrect the bill. The situation surrounding the silver bill is extremely chaotic, and even sensitive observers are unable to predict its outcome. The President's position is also unfathomable, due to conflicting statements by both the president and the Senate's silver faction. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will meet with President Roosevelt early next week, seeking to clarify the government's position, and then the silver faction will visit the President to propose a new silver bill.

<p>German Airship Nearing Completion - Using Inert Gas to Prevent Accidents</p>
<p>Large Airframe, Fully Equipped, Exceeding Zeppelin's Expectations</p>
<p>Friedrichshafen, Germany - The newest and largest German airship, the LZ-129, is nearing completion and will soon be available for public viewing. Every thirty visitors will have one person who can ride the ship for free. The ship is 135 feet wide and 42 feet long, with four public promenade decks, a reading room, a smoking room, a dining room, a kitchen, and twenty-five bedrooms, all equipped with hot and cold water. The cargo hold is large enough to hold several cars. This ship has clearly been remodeled in light of the cause of the crash of the British airship R-101 in France in 1929, which killed forty-nine people, not only with designs to prevent similar disasters, but also utilizing many of the original materials of the R-101, as the German government purchased the destroyed materials after the British airship crashed. It has been found that Germany, before the British aircraft accident, had already started the construction of an airship project and was halfway complete. When they heard of the tragedy of the British airship, they stopped work, and the new drawing board was that the only way to ensure safety was to rebuild it. So it demolished an airship nearly halfway complete and rebuilt it. To prevent major disasters, the airship uses inert gas, and uses unrefined oil to generate propulsion. The gas volume is 190,000 cubic meters and is stored in 19 separate gas cells. The famous Zeppelin airship had only 13 gas cells, storing 137,000 cubic meters of gas. The ship is equipped with four Maybach diesel engines of 850 to 1,000 horsepower, rotating four propellers, and has a speed of 80 to 93 miles per hour, so major disasters can be greatly reduced.

<p>Local News: Hong Kong and Guangdong Press Delegation Arrives in Shanghai. The Delegation is Scheduled to Go to Beijing on the 17th.</p>
<p>A delegation of eight people from the Hong Kong and Guangdong press circles, including Chen Kewen, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3 PM via the McKinley Liner from Hong Kong. They plan to stay for three days to visit various newspaper offices and printing factories in Shanghai before proceeding to Beijing and then traveling to various locations along the Pinghan Railway. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the press circles of Guangdong and Hong Kong, in order to strengthen ties among the national press industry and investigate the actual conditions of economic construction in various regions, formed a domestic inspection team of Guangdong and Hong Kong press. All members of the team arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4 PM on the President McKinley. Representatives of Hong Kong and Guangdong newspapers stationed in Shanghai, the local Newspaper Association, the Reporters Association, the China Daily, and representatives from the municipal government went to the Jianghai Customs to welcome them.</p>
<p>List of Team Members</p>
<p>The team members include Wen Xinggong, representing the Hong Kong Xunhuan Daily, Xunhuan Evening News, Daguang Daily, and Guangzhou Xinguohua Daily; Hu Zhiwu, representing the Industrial and Commercial Daily, Industrial and Commercial Evening News, and Tianguang Daily; Liang Yuzhang, representing the Huazi Daily; Wei Guolun, representing the Overseas Chinese Daily, Nanzhong Daily, and Nanqiang Daily; Chen Kewen, representing the Nanhua Daily; Zhong Zheng and Zhong Chaoqun, representing the Guangzhou Gongping Daily; and Chen Jiarui, representing the Guangzhou Chengbao Daily. In total, there are eight team members representing fifteen newspapers. Two more team members are expected to arrive within the next few days. All team members are currently staying at the New Asia Hotel on Yangsichuan Road.</p>
<p>Inspection Itinerary</p>
<p>The team's planned inspection locations and itinerary are as follows: Starting from Hong Kong, they will arrive in Shanghai and stay for three days to inspect the city's industrial and commercial sectors and various newspapers. They will also visit the war zone. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing on the 17th, then proceed to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and observe the situation in the former communist-controlled areas. Afterward, they will return to Jiujiang and take a boat to Wuhan, then travel along the Pinghan Railway to Beijing and Tianjin to assess the situation in North China. They will then take the Jinpu Railway through Qingdao and Jinan back to Nanjing, and then travel along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to inspect various locations in Suzhou and Hangzhou. Finally, they will return to Shanghai and take a boat back to Hong Kong. The entire journey is expected to take approximately three months.</p>
<p>Four Objectives</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Hu Zhiwu, a team member, spoke on behalf of the team to a reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency, stating that the purpose of this domestic inspection team organized by the press circles of Guangdong and Hong Kong has four points: (1) To connect with the national press industry to seek common cooperation; (2) To visit the capital and understand the progress and new atmosphere of various political and economic constructions since the establishment of the capital in Nanjing; (3) To investigate the industrial and commercial sectors in North and Central China, so that they can provide introductions and reports to the people of South China after returning to Guangdong and Hong Kong, to further promote close connections; (4) To inspect the progress of communist suppression in Jiangxi and the reconstruction situation after the recovery of communist-controlled areas, to understand the overall situation. In addition, they will also investigate various points that should be noted in the newspaper industry at any time. Regarding the situation in South China, it is said that Guangdong, Hong Kong, and various southwestern regions have recently been stable. The work of suppressing communists in Guangdong Province has been quite effective. The authorities are currently working hard to implement the three-year construction plan. Although there are rumors of recent Japanese threats to South China, there is no actual indication of it. However, based on past conspiracies, other actions are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Local Reception</p>
<p>After the team arrived in Shanghai, the local Newspaper Association, the Reporters Association, and various private newspaper companies, in order to connect with industry colleagues, will host banquets in the next two days. The municipal government has also scheduled a banquet today to welcome them and has arranged for officials from the Social Affairs Bureau to lead them in visiting the city's industrial and commercial sectors and the "January 28th" battlefields in Zhabei and Jiangwan, starting today. It is reported that the team is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing on the 17th, and then travel to various locations in Wuhan, Beijing, and Tianjin for inspection.</p>
<p>Selangor Overseas Chinese Asian Inspection Team to the Yangtze River Basin</p>
<p>Sending Representatives to Inspect Culture, Transportation, and Industry, with a Focus on the Northwest after Visiting the Yangtze River Basin</p>
<p>The Selangor Overseas Chinese of British Malaya have organized an Asian inspection team to investigate the culture, transportation, and industry of their homeland in order to report to the overseas Chinese community, encourage investment in the country, and revitalize the foundation of industry. The team consists of four members. Except for one member who was injured in a communist attack, the remaining three members have completed their investigation in Shanghai and will take a boat to various ports along the Yangtze River and then to the Northwest. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has agreed to provide half-price tickets. Yesterday, a reporter met with the team leader, Mr. Tang Baiqing, who described their journey as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Focus on the Homeland</p>
<p>There are many Chinese residing in Selangor, British Malaya. Recently, various overseas Chinese organizations, wishing to understand the situation in their homeland, specifically appointed the Selangor Health and Sports Association to form an Asian travel inspection team. Tang Baiqing, Liao Yu, Ding Zhiwen, and Chen Xinya were selected as members of the inspection team. Their inspection covers Asia, and each member departed from the Republic of China in 1931. They first arrived in Hong Kong, then entered Jiangxi from Fujian, planning to travel from Jiangxi to Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and other provinces, and finally to North China. Their investigation focuses on culture, education, transportation, industry, and local customs, with a planned duration of four years.</p>
<p>Encountering Bandits and Injury in Jiangxi</p>
<p>The team entered Jiangxi from Fujian and ventured deep into the communist-controlled areas of Jiangxi, where they were surrounded by communists and faced great danger. Fortunately, the Central Army launched an offensive, and the team members escaped amidst the gunfire. However, Ding Zhiwen, who was responsible for documentation, was shot in the leg by the communists and could not continue the journey. He returned to Fuzhou from Jiangxi and then went to a hospital in Hong Kong for treatment. As a result, the planned route was also changed, and it was decided to first visit Annam and Burma, and then inspect the Central Plains.</p>

<p>Tang Baiqing and Liao and Chen changed their route to Haiphong, Annam. Unexpectedly, when they arrived in Vietnam, they were detained by the French authorities, who did not allow them to enter for inspection. The reason given was that they did not have a written notice from the Chinese Ambassador to France. Although Tang and others presented passports issued by the national government, they were still ineffective. As a result, they were detained for twenty-four days. Later, with the certification from local overseas Chinese and the Chinese consulate, they were released. After the setbacks in Annam, they did not get discouraged and inspected Burma and other places.</p>
<p>Completing the South China Inspection and Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>After inspecting Burma, they went to Yunnan and Guizhou, and then from Guangxi to Guangdong. It is said that the hardships and difficulties they experienced during the inspection of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi were indescribable. Their inspection of these four provinces took a long time. Now they have come to Shanghai from Guangzhou. It is estimated that they have inspected five provinces in the Southwest, as well as Taiwan, Vietnam, Burma, and other ports. After arriving in Shanghai, they have met with Mayor Wu, Wen Hongen, Tang Haian, and others. They now plan to go to Beijing and then to the Yangtze River basin.</p>
<p>Leaving for the Yangtze River Immediately</p>
<p>In recent days, Tang and others have been inspecting various locations in Shanghai with the introduction of Mayor Wu, which is nearing completion. Yesterday, they specifically went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to request fare reductions, and the company has agreed to charge half price to show preferential treatment. Tang and others plan to take a boat from Shanghai to Beijing in a day or two to meet with important figures in the central government, and then follow the Yangtze River route to inspect the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. According to Mr. Tang, a detailed report of the investigation will be sent to the Selangor headquarters every two weeks and relayed to overseas Chinese in various ports. In the future, an "Asian Inspection Book" will be compiled for reference by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Northwest is Particularly Important</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, the great rivers and mountains of the Northeast have been forcibly occupied by the Japanese puppet regime. Mr. Tang said that the most important area for the team is the Northwest. The Northwest has vast land and abundant resources. If our country can seize the opportunity to develop it, then each region can benefit from its resources, no one will be left abandoned, and the strength of the country will depend on it. After the investigation of the Yangtze River basin is completed, I will go to the Northwest for a detailed investigation and provide the information obtained from the field investigation to overseas Chinese in various regions so that they can invest and assist in development.</p>
<p>In order to connect with industry colleagues, banquets will be hosted in the next two days. The municipal government has also scheduled a banquet today to welcome them and has arranged for officials from the Social Affairs Bureau to lead them in visiting the city's industrial and commercial sectors and the "January 28th" battlefields in Zhabei and Jiangwan, starting today. It is reported that the team is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing on the 17th, and then travel to various locations in Wuhan, Beijing, and Tianjin for inspection.</p>
<p>Lu Jingpu, Director of Preparations for the Central Machine Factory, Went to England Yesterday to Purchase Machinery</p>
<p>According to the Daily News Agency, the Central Machine Factory, which has been under preparation by the Ministry of Industry for a long time, originally planned to locate its factory in Caoxie Gorge, Nanjing. However, due to the low-lying terrain in that area, the filling work would be very costly, and the construction of factory buildings would not be very economical. Therefore, Lu Jingpu, the director of preparations for the factory, came to Shanghai a month ago to survey another site. He identified several dozen acres of land remaining at the Junpu Bureau in Pudong, which has now been purchased and a contract has been signed. As for the construction funds for the factory, 6,000 pounds have been borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, and the procedures are about to be completed. In order to expedite the construction, the Ministry specifically sent Lu to England to purchase machinery. It is learned that after being dispatched, Lu came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and took a boat to England on the morning of the 13th. He will stay in England for about three months and will be able to start construction after returning to China.</p>
<p>Interest on the 44 Million Yuan Loan Has Been Paid by the Customs</p>
<p>The face value of the certificates is under negotiation.</p>
<p>It is not true that it is circulated abroad and in the market.</p>
<p>After the 44 million yuan loan from sixteen banks, including the Central Bank, to the Ministry of Finance was fully disbursed, the principal and interest from January to April of this year have been paid by the Customs. The certificates will definitely not be circulated abroad or in the market. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Repayment of Principal and Interest</p>
<p>The principal and interest of the Italian Boxer Indemnity loan, which should be repaid by the Ministry of Finance to the bank syndicate, have been allocated by the Jianghai Customs to the Central Bank at the end of each month in accordance with the contract provisions. The Central Bank then transfers the funds to the China and Communications Banks, which are entrusted by the bank syndicate to receive and pay them. The two banks then distribute the funds to each bank according to the amount borrowed. It is estimated that the principal repayment has been 375,000 yuan per month from January to April of the Republic of China Year 23. At the same time, each bank returns the certificates issued by the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Finance for cancellation on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Continued Negotiation of Certificates</p>
<p>The face value of the certificates is divided into two types: 10,000 yuan and 1,000 yuan. The bank syndicate, consisting of sixteen banks such as the Central Bank, China Bank, Communications Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Continental Bank, Jincheng Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Shanghai Commercial Bank, China Industrial Bank, Guohuo Bank, Guohua Bank, Kenye Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Donglai Bank, with varying borrowing amounts, requested the Ministry of Finance to divide the certificates into three types: 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Conducts Intermodal Transportation</p>
<p>Zhou Fengtu, Director of Intermodal Transportation, Returns to Shanghai. The Beijing-Ningbo Railway Has Signed the Agreement, and the Ping-Sui Railway's Implementation is Temporarily Delayed.</p>
<p>Zhou Fengtu, who went to Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping to negotiate intermodal transportation for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, returned to Shanghai the morning before yesterday. The Beijing-Ningbo Railway contract has been signed, and the Ping-Sui Railway agreement has been reached and the contract is in the drafting process. The implementation of the Ping-Han and Jin-Pu Railways is scheduled to proceed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Determination of Jiaoji Railway Freight Rates</p>
<p>Zhou Fengtu, a specialist in the intermodal transportation division of the business department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was ordered to go to Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping and other places to negotiate water and land intermodal transportation matters. He has now completed his mission. He took the Ping-Hu intermodal express train from Beiping and arrived in Shanghai the morning before yesterday. He went to the bureau yesterday morning to report the progress of the negotiations with the various railways to He Molin, the director of the business department, and Liu Hongsheng, the general manager. After the implementation of the Jiaoji Railway intermodal transportation, the detailed pricing of the intermodal transportation has been negotiated by Zhou Fengtu and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau and finalized and printed.</p>
<p>Signing of the Beijing-Ningbo Railway Contract</p>
<p>Regarding the Beijing-Ningbo Railway water and land intermodal transportation, Zhou Fengtu and Chen Qingwen, the director of the transportation department of the Beijing-Ningbo Railway, and Wang Xuan, the director of the accounting department, formally signed the contract in Tianjin last week. The content is the same as the Longhai and Jiaoji Railways, stipulating Tanggu and Tianjin as the transfer locations. All railway stations are added to handle intermodal transportation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company handles intermodal transportation ports in Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. All intermodal transportation documents have also been drafted, and the implementation date is approximately in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Proper Negotiation of the Ping-Sui Railway</p>
<p>After the Beijing-Ningbo Railway contract was signed, Zhou Fengtu went to Beiping and contacted Jin Shiyi, the director of the transportation department of the Ping-Sui Railway, to handle intermodal transportation matters. The result was very satisfactory. The draft of the water and land intermodal transportation contract has been drafted. After review by the Railway Bureau and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it can be formally signed. All intermodal transportation goods are transported from the Ping-Sui Railway to Fengtai, transferred to the Beijing-Ningbo Railway to Tianjin or Tanggu as the transfer location. Therefore, the implementation date must be determined after the Beijing-Ningbo Railway is implemented.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Jinpu Railway and Pinghan Railway signed the water and land intermodal transportation contracts separately, the transfer location for the Jinpu Railway is Pukou, and the transfer location for the Pinghan Railway is Hankou. Now, the intermodal transportation dock warehouse on the Hankou riverside of the Pinghan Railway and the newly built lighter of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have been completed. In addition, the intermodal transportation procedures for the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways have also been prepared. It was originally scheduled to be implemented this month, but it was postponed due to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company being busy with the Jiaoji Railway intermodal transportation. It is now decided to implement the Pinghan Railway first in early June. As for the Jinpu Railway intermodal transportation, it will be implemented around early July.</p>
<p>Now, because each bank has interest coupons for certificates with less than 1,000 yuan per period, it is still difficult to distribute them if they are divided into three types. Therefore, the bank syndicate and the Ministry of Finance are continuing to negotiate. The number of certificates. The first phase of certificates from January to June of the Republic of China Year 23 has been issued. The second phase of certificates after June of the Republic of China Year 23 will be issued after the negotiation is completed.</p>
<p>No Circulation Allowed</p>
<p>It is rumored that the Italian Boxer Indemnity loan certificates issued by the Ministry of Finance can be sold abroad and circulated in the market. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banks in the bank syndicate yesterday that this is absolutely not true. Because the Ministry of Finance repays the bank syndicate's principal and interest at the end of each month, the bank syndicate must return the certificates for that month for cancellation. Therefore, it can only be circulated among the banks in the bank syndicate to adjust the financial situation. If it is circulated outside the bank syndicate, it will inevitably cause difficulties when returning the certificates each month.</p>

<p>Shunkang Ran into Fog and Ran Aground</p>
<p>The Location is Near Datong, and Two Ships Have Been Sent to Tow it Away.</p>
<p>The Shunkang, a ship owned by the Shanghai Meishun Shipping Company, ran aground near Datong due to fog while transporting goods from the Yangtze River to Nanhua. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transporting Goods to Nanhua</p>
<p>The Shunkang, owned by the Meishun Company, weighs over 3,100 tons and is a "wild chicken" cargo ship that regularly travels between Shanghai and various ports in Nanhua, specializing in cargo. This time, the ship loaded 2,800 tons of coal and timber from Anhui Province, destined for Xiamen for unloading. It set sail on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Foggy Conditions and Ship Aground</p>
<p>The Yangtze River has been experiencing heavy fog recently, making it difficult for ships to navigate. The Shunkang ran aground near Datong, at a location called Fitzroy Island Middle Channel on the river. The pilot on board the Shunkang was negligent, causing the ship to run aground on a sandbar on the riverbank. Due to the heavy cargo on board, the ship sank deep into the water. Although the shipowner tried various methods to get it out of danger, it was unsuccessful, so he sent a telegram to Shanghai for help.</p>
<p>Sending Ships to Tow It Away</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Meishun Company received a telegram from the Shunkang shipowner. After discussion, the company decided to send the Shihe and Minghe ships, along with workers and necessary equipment, from Shanghai to Datong in the morning. They plan to first unload part of the cargo on the ship to reduce the weight of the hull and then tow it. According to company personnel, the Shunkang hull has not been damaged, and it should be possible to tow it out of the shallows in a day or two.</p>
<p>Male Corpse in the Wheat Field of Shenjia Lane, Pudong</p>
<p>The Corpse Was Covered in Knife Wounds, and the Death Was Extremely Tragic.</p>
<p>In Shenjia Lane, Pudong, east of Xiaolijiazhai, there is a vast wheat field with few pedestrians. At 6:00 PM the night before last, a patrol officer from the first precinct of the third district arrived there and was suddenly reported by a village child that there was a male corpse with knife wounds in the wheat field. The patrol officer went in to investigate and found a corpse lying in the field. However, the wheat grew so tall that it was difficult to see from the road. The patrol officer immediately returned to the station to report, and Director Yang immediately dispatched patrol officer Sun Yulin and police chief Dai Guanqing to investigate. It was found that the deceased was about thirty years old, with a flat-top haircut and long hair. He was wearing blue cloth shirt and pants, gray socks, and black cloth shoes. There was one knife wound in each eye, one on each cheek, one on the mouth, two on the neck, one on the chest, and knife wounds on the lower abdomen. The neck was stabbed the most severely, with a large piece of flesh missing and the heart visible. The death was extremely tragic. However, there were no bloodstains next to the corpse, indicating that the murderer secretly moved the corpse there after killing him to avoid suspicion. It is estimated that the corpse was moved in the middle of the night one or two days ago, making it difficult to find clues about the murderer for a while. The patrol officer returned to the station and sent police officers to guard the site. Yesterday morning, Director Yang instructed Baojia Shen Lansheng to report to the local court for inspection. In the afternoon, the court appointed a prosecutor to come to the scene in Pudong for an inspection. It was verified that the deceased was indeed assassinated. As no relatives came forward to claim the body, it was ordered to be sent to the funeral home and the murderer was to be arrested and prosecuted.</p>
<p>After the Son Secretly Seized the Inheritance, He Sold His Cousin as a Concubine</p>
<p>Fortunately, a Bill of Sale Was Not Signed, and a Lawsuit Was Filed in Court to Seek Justice.</p>
<p>Feng Jindi, a woman from Wuxi, is 28 years old. Both of her parents died when she was young. Fortunately, she still had a small inheritance, which was enough to make a living. Later, after a family meeting, Feng Rongzhao's younger brother was established as her adopted son. After Jindi got married, the entire inheritance would be handed over to the adopted son. However, after Feng Rongzhao's younger brother became her adopted son, he saw that Jindi never mentioned marriage, which greatly hindered his inheritance of the property. Therefore, Feng Rongzhao and his wife, Zhu, secretly devised a plan. In February of this year, Zhu told Jindi that a Mr. Jiang wanted to marry a second wife because his first wife had died, and her brother could help her. She would be married to him as a replacement and married in a Shanghai hotel. Jindi, being of age, expressed her permission to choose a match. She asked them to seek the consent of her aunt, Xue, who, not knowing the truth, also agreed. In early March, she followed them to Shanghai and was introduced to Jiang Yaoquan (manager of He Kang Sauce Garden on North Zhejiang Road), who was also from their hometown. It was agreed that the wedding would be held on March 19. At that time, two written documents were taken out and Jindi was asked to sign. Jindi saw that these two documents were not like wedding invitations or marriage certificates, and she became suspicious. Because she was illiterate, she did not sign and made an excuse to take one copy back to ask someone to read it. After reading it, it turned out that the</p>

<p>Business News, Financial Swap Relationship Margin Rises to Six Yuan. Starting Next Week, Opening Will Be Changed to 9:00 AM. The Gold Market Yesterday, After Approval by the Board of Directors, Saw a Rise in Swap Relationships, Short Covering, a Sudden Surge in Buying, and a Noticeably Brisk Market. Early Morning Was Influenced by Overseas Silver Markets Where the British Pound Weakened and the US Dollar Strengthened. Five Gold Exchanges Experienced Mixed Fluctuations in Spot Silver, Ranging from a 1% Decrease to a 4.1% Increase. Exchange Rates Generally Decreased. US Cotton Rose Slightly While US Wheat Declined from 0.879 to 1.625 Points. (According to Today's Telegraph, If Rain Is Obtained, the Harvest Will Be Excellent, and the Order to Limit Production Has Been Canceled, Leading to a Bearish Outlook.) London Spot Gold Fell by Three Pence. In Washington, It Was Believed That the Silver Faction Would Be Subdued by the President, and Hopes for the Silver Bill Were Dim, Which Greatly Boosted Confidence. Subsequently, There Was a Strong Increase of 10 Yuan. Major Dealers Such as Zhengchang, Qianchang, Xiangfu, Chu, etc., Vigorously Covered Their Positions. Western Merchants Also Entered the Market. Although There Was a Downturn, the Lowering of Exchange Rates Still Allowed It to Hold Above the 30 Yuan Mark. Later, Due to Banks' Efforts to Sell, the Domestic Market Weakened, Forcing a Citywide Downturn, but the Underlying Strength Was Extremely Firm. When Bank Selling Weakened, There Was a Rebound. The Market Was Originally Optimistic, and at the Slightest Fluctuation, an Upsurge Immediately Appeared, Eventually Rising to 35 Yuan After the Noon Session. The Market, Influenced by the Noon Session, Opened High, and Short Covering Continued. It Was Also Rumored That the Central Bank Was Buying Spot. Mumbai Fell and Then Rose, but Banks Took Advantage of the High Prices to Sell Vigorously, and Gold Prices Returned Slightly, but the Market Still Showed Demand Exceeding Supply. The Swap Premium Saw Some Bulls Willing to Pay an Additional 5-6 Yuan to Extend Their Positions, but Others Were Looking at 3-4 Yuan. Short Sellers, Due to the Approaching Swap Deadline, Were Reluctant to Lightly Add to Their Positions. Subsequently, News of Japanese Cash Being Intercepted En Route Caused Another Surge, Almost Approaching the 4,000 Yuan Mark.

Before the close, the empty side made up for it and rebounded. It is still difficult to measure the degree to which the exchange case will affect the market. Traders are unwilling to take risks during the weekend. American Telephone and Telegraph is flat due to expectations that the board of directors will maintain the regular interest rate for this quarter. According to rumors, the Ministry of Finance sold gold and bought foreign exchange and silver, so the silver price rebounded, but the silver stocks were tired.

There are large households selling off yarn and flower labels. The yarn market has turned flat and tired again. Because the Tianjin gang has not purchased the spot yarn, people's hearts are slightly weakened. There are large households selling off, and the market situation is relatively tired, but the demand from Yunnan and other gangs is said to be good, but it is still difficult to attract more. However, recently, the purchase from all parties has been very strong, and the factory's inventory has been reduced a lot, and the flower price is also very high, so the yarn market will not fall sharply. The yarn label is flat and tired. The yarn label opened in the previous market and took the lead from last Saturday. The prices of all months jumped up by eight or nine corners. In the second market, the American cotton was flat, and there were not many buyers. Most of them were short sellers.

[P Grain Market Initially Set for Continued Rise in Flour&gt; Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a sign of initial setting and continued rise. Because the foreign wheat quote in Chicago continued to fall by about 245 points, and Canada fell by 400 points, people's hearts were still stable at the beginning. Later, due to the rising rice prices in recent days, people's hearts in the industry could not help but turn, and some Doumi industry customers and North Road gangs all rushed in, resulting in a strong market atmosphere, and the market gradually rose, regaining a fraction compared with the closing price of the previous week. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the transactions in each month were slightly less than in the morning. Factories in this city and some southern factories gradually sold off, and even Jinbang slightly returned, so in the tense market, it was already weak. It is found that the current inventory is still thick, and the old wheat has continued to arrive, and the new wheat will soon be on the market. After that, the rise and fall still depends on the actual sales as a shift. As a result, this month rose by one and a half points, June and July rose by one point and seven minutes and a half, August and September rose by two minutes and five, and October rose by one point and seven minutes. The wheat futures market turned to a soft route. Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a sign of initial stability and then falling.

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Discussion: "International Principles, Qiong Sound"</p>
<p>Qiong Sound</p>
<p>Since Japan issued a statement on its policy towards China on April 17th, it has arrogantly opposed other countries' "unfriendly behavior" in assisting China, seemingly wanting to dominate East Asia and treat China as its possession. This bombshell, thrown among the powers vying for the Pacific, immediately caused a global sensation, with sparks flying. Britain rejected Japan's "non-interference in China" in advance, and on April 29th, the United States formally presented a note to Japan opposing the Monroe Doctrine of East Asia. Recently, when Japanese Ambassador to France Sato met with French Foreign Minister Barthou, Barthou also repeatedly stated his respect for China's independence and the treaty rights of the powers, reiterating the meaning of Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>The cunning "wooden clogs" friends, seeing the unfavorable situation, then rang the bell to extricate themselves. Hirota replied to the British and American ambassadors, saying that the April 17th statement was not "officially existing," indicating the withdrawal of the intention of the declaration on China. To go back on one's words, and a diplomatic official being forced to slap his own face, what caused this? According to Hirota's remarks, Japan respects the sovereignty of the Republic of China, has no intention of infringing upon China's sovereignty under any circumstances, does not violate the open-door policy, and also respects the treaties and rights of all countries in China. What is this? Hirota said this is the "international principle" that Japan is extremely eager to abide by.</p>
<p>What is the international principle? It is the "indenture" that China won at the Washington Conference, nominally to maintain the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, but in reality, it is purely a "semi-colony" of the international market. The so-called equal opportunity and open-door policy is the true meaning of not allowing any power to monopolize and not allowing any power to be excluded. However, the clever aggressor, not feeling satiated after seizing the four northeastern provinces, took advantage of the troubles in Europe, the weakness of North America, and the numerous disputes among countries, attempting to break this equilibrium, and of course, wanting to break this "international principle." Therefore, we can warn those who advocate cooperation and goodwill that the "international principle" is precisely the shackles of the Chinese nation. We must never regard this "principle" as a magic charm, carrying it around everywhere to seek survival. The facts tell us that it is impossible. We do not want others to use iron birds and warships to break this international principle, so only we ourselves can smash this "international principle" through national revolutionary warfare to win the true independence of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Scientific Spiritualism and Others</p>
<p>Xi Zhen</p>
<p>To what extent is the great Kalachakra Tantra assembly truly great? We have no way of guessing. However, the sacred yellow wind has blown to Shanghai. In this city filled with coal smoke, garbage, and cosmetics, although it is not as clear, pure, and solemn as Lingyin Temple in West Lake, one can occasionally see on the street, at newsstands, at bookstalls, in front of slippery bookstores, in the hands of peddlers, and in the "consignment department" attached to the foreign socks and elastic band stalls, all hanging densely with sheets of sacred yellow things, printed with half of a "student dictionary" arranged in a circle, and in the center of the circle, there is a crooked face that looks three parts human and seven parts like a ghost (it is said that this is also one of the greatest inventions of modern times), and there are yellow slogans... "Completely scientific method," "eliminate superstition," "you'll know if it's effective after one try," "three minutes to talk to ghosts," and finally... "Scientific Spiritualism, only 20 cents per copy." Originally, what the people of Shanghai see in their eyes, think in their hearts, and do in their dreams is all dominated by yellow. They probably won't be disgusted by this all-yellow "completely scientific" thing. Judging from the state of "extreme momentary prosperity," its sales must be at least five or six times more than "Midnight." University students, middle school students, elementary school students, young ladies, grandmothers, nanny, and rickshaw pullers, everyone has one in hand. And it is said that its function is also really great; spending 20 cents can ask about the rise and fall of the national fortune (someone invited a ghost from the scientific spiritualism and asked him about the future of China and Japan. The answer was that Japan's arrogance is a fixed number, they'll shake for a while, and soon gods and generals will come down to clean them up; and said that China is a great country and shouldn't argue with these barbarians, let them perish on their own. I suspect that the soul of Ah Q was invited. I want to ask Mr. Lu Xun to copy out Ah Q's year of birth, death, month, day, and time to prepare a longevity tablet for him in the Kalachakra Tantra assembly.); secondly, one might as well ask about the winning numbers for the next aviation lottery, and then spend ten dollars to buy a whole ticket, close the door and prepare to get 500,000 (this deal is probably worth doing, right?). At the very least, you can invite "Knight Zhang Jiu Guan" to ask about tomorrow morning's flower game, and even if you pawn the bed sheet, you have to bet a dollar, and by tomorrow afternoon, you won't have to worry about 35 white silver dollars for a month's room and board. A scientific spiritualism for two mao is much more effective than a packet of the old brand Ren Dan for 15 coppers... People are inherently clever animals, especially the "20th century" humans who are specially designated. Not doing a cheap deal is the top-notch idiot. Shanghai is indeed a golden city; in the past, someone heard that London was full of gold dust, so they walked thousands of miles to London, and as a result, they were greatly deceived. Now we can confidently pat our chests and say to others that Shanghai's walls are full of money... ten dollars for 500,000, one dollar for 35, "and so on by analogy"; and science has developed to this point, it can indeed be said to be the greatest glory of science. However, everyone wants to get rich. "To avoid crowding, we have to slightly limit it." Each aviation lottery ticket costs one dollar, and it is clearly stated that everyone can get it, but those who can't come up with a dollar can't get it; and in front of the "scientific spiritualism" stalls, there are also many yellow-faced and emaciated people with not even a copper coin left in their pockets watching the excitement. This world is ultimately fun. There are countless "new performances" for people to enjoy and appreciate; but in the midst of the noise of the "Kalachakra Tantra assembly" and "scientific spiritualism," we actually saw the Qin family sighing "good seeds are not left" and seeking that final relief. What can we say about this?</p>
<p>After Watching the Jiangwan Competition</p>
<p>Ji San</p>
<p>This year is the year of children and the year of women's national products. This was already agreed upon last year. Recently, it seems that a "year of gods and ghosts" (?) has been added.</p>
<p>Isn't that right? From Qingming Festival to now, all kinds of gatherings such as welcoming gods and holding lantern parades, which have long been regarded as bad customs by the government and explicitly prohibited and have been silent for a long time, have suddenly become popular. Without prior consultation, they have been held enthusiastically, one after another, with ten thousand people thronging the streets. The rituals are competing for novelty and splendor, bizarre and colorful; the believers are offering incense and kowtowing, and the convicts are parading through the streets; as if this is not enough to please the gods and ghosts, not enough to atone for one's sins; as if without the protection of the gods, the country will not be peaceful and the people will not be safe, and the five grains will not be abundant. After watching the so-called inspection tour of Liu Sanye of the Dongyue Temple in Jiangwan... the number of participants was 50,000, and the number of spectators was no less than 200,000. Even counties such as Shangbao and Nantong also had rituals and rehearsals and parades. It can be said to be an unprecedented grand occasion, which shows the enthusiasm of the people for their inherent customs.</p>
<p>I recall the lantern festival at the Pengchang Temple in West Shanghai on April 4th, 5th, and 6th. According to a friend who knows the inside story... the expenses for lighting lanterns, waiting for the Buddha, meals, and setting up lanterns alone amounted to tens of thousands of yuan. If the incense and candles of the people and the scattered consumption are included, it would be no less than two or three hundred thousand yuan. Such meaningless consumption, rash actions, although it is one way for the people to entertain themselves, are ultimately too many superstitious actions, and they are a waste of money and manpower. It is indeed a bad custom, as the Central</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>The People's Training Council issued a general order to correct it urgently. Not only correct it, but also punish those who take the opportunity to collect money and are suspected of neglecting government orders. I hope that the authorities and those with prestige in society will learn from the past and avoid future mistakes, so that such a year of gods and ghosts (?) will no longer appear in today's party rule.</p>
<p>I think that instead of holding competitions in various places to welcome gods and pray for blessings, why not participate in the Kalachakra Tantra assembly initiated by the Panchen Lama and other important figures? Any "bitterness for deceased relatives, or prayer for the well-being of existing parents, or elimination of one's own karma, or prevention of other disasters, to recommend the deceased and prolong life, and to resolve temporal calamities," its "supernatural recommendation of the spirits of those who died violently and without masters, is of great merit"! But this is built for the noble people. Ordinary poor and hardworking people cannot participate and receive Bodhi. Moreover, who among the laborious people who are far away from the mountains and rivers have the time and money to visit the beautiful West Lake and go to Lingyin Temple in Tianzhu to receive the light of the Dharma! Even if it is possible to set up a position on their behalf, it is not as interesting as personally participating in a more popular competition nearby. Moreover, chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha and welcoming gods and holding competitions are both worshiping virtuous predecessors and gods. Therefore, the people driven by enthusiasm ignore the government orders and rashly do what they should do. Although there is no great gentleman advocating it like the dharma assembly, they are quite willing, which contains a lot of upward and downward force! Presumably, the authorities are inconvenienced to correct it immediately and let it take its course. The fact is that throwing a rat and fearing breaking the dishes is difficult to justify. I don't know how the authorities will resolve the contradiction, to manifest virtue to the world, and to guide the feudal and superstitious people under the true clear sky and white sun.</p>
<p>"As You Wish" Transmission (1)</p>
<p>Forgetting Self Self-Introduction Name Furu Yinu Slave Education</p>
<p>Jing Jia</p>
<p>Evening. Leaning alone by the window, gazing idly. A vendor carrying a load of candy stopped at the entrance of the alley, and many children immediately came to surround the load.</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman, holding a child of five or six years old, passed by this place. The child saw the candy load and stopped.</p>
<p>"Mom, I want to buy candy to eat." The child pleaded, looking at the woman's face.</p>
<p>"There's some when we get home!" The woman said kindly... "You can't eat this kind of candy, it's poisonous, and you won't grow up if you eat it! There's some when we get home!"</p>
<p>"No, I want to eat this candy!" The child insisted.</p>
<p>"Be good, I'll give you some right away when we get home!"</p>
<p>"No!" The child looked at the candy load.</p>
<p>"Let's go home!" The woman commanded.</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Okay, you stay here, I'm leaving! A kidnapper will come and take you to a foreign country, aren't you afraid?" The woman deliberately took a few steps forward. The child still didn't leave.</p>
<p>"The kidnapper is really coming! Over there, over there!" The woman tricked the child. The child really got anxious, ran over, but when he looked back, no one was coming, and he stopped again!</p>
<p>"Aren't you leaving?" The child didn't move.</p>
<p>The woman caught up and hit him lightly... "Are you leaving?" The child cried aggrievedly. In the end, he didn't satisfy his desire and followed her away!</p>
<p>I sighed. This truly deserves to be called a "good" education! To save a few copper coins, they don't hesitate to use deception on their own children, and then follow it up with beatings, cultivating the child's servility. After the country is conquered in the future, there's no need to worry about not having food to eat!</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox Husband's Unfaithfulness</p>
<p>Editor Sir,</p>
<p>I have a very difficult matter now that I want to ask you about. I am a person who has not received a high-level education, and my writing is very poor. Please forgive me and answer me as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I am 22 years old this year, and my family is old-fashioned. When I was 15 years old, a matchmaker introduced me to a family named Li in Shanghai. At that time, my fiancé was 18 years old, three years older than me, named Yueru. My parents arranged for me to be engaged to the Li family. Before the engagement, his father and son came to see me. When I was 17 years old, they wanted to get married. I was young and ignorant, but they insisted on getting married, so I married him. Later, after the Shanghai January 28th Incident, he didn't talk to me at all. I was baffled. I didn't say anything good or bad to him. Why did he ignore me?</p>
<p>Now he suddenly wants to divorce me. Sir, I have two children, one five years old and one three years old. If I divorce him, won't I be abandoning my own children? If I don't divorce him, I will have to endure his coldness. I have become a person with no place to settle down.</p>
<p>I am now in a dilemma. I haven't done anything bad. What should I say to him? Please teach me, sir.</p>
<p>People say that he now has someone else. He doesn't live at home now. But he doesn't come to talk to me in person. Alas! He can have a new person, but I cannot have a new person. Sir, please find a way for me!</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Li Chengxuezhen</p>
<p>Reply: In your situation, it is probably very difficult to get your husband to change his mind and reconcile. Because he abandoned you, not because you offended him, and therefore ignored you. He has another "new person," so he ignores you. Have you ever asked someone to persuade you? If not, you might as well try it. But I think it's useless.</p>
<p>If mediation is unsuccessful, you can only resort to legal means. He married another person, which is a crime of bigamy; he ignores you, which is a crime of abandonment. If you don't want to divorce him, you can ask for a separation and let him continue to pay for household expenses. These are clearly stipulated in the current law, and you can demand them according to the law. However, if his finances are not abundant and he really can't afford alimony and can't afford two families, then it will be difficult. Also, if your request is not only economic, and you also want to restore the happiness of your family, it will be even more difficult. These, unless "he" can truly change his mind, there is no way, the law cannot solve it. But why do you feel so unfortunate? Why can't you get remedies? How can we prevent this kind of pain from happening again?</p>
<p>In this society, the husband's abuse and bullying of his wife cannot be resisted by the wife. The reason is that the wife has to rely on her husband for a living. Therefore, in the old concept, it is not surprising to see this kind of thing. Instead, they created the "three obediences and four virtues," "a peasant who harvests an extra load of rice can marry another wife," and so on, which elevated the husband's power to the extreme, while women were left to the husband's disposal. Since women are bound because they cannot be economically independent, wouldn't it solve everything if they could be independent? This is not the case. This kind of talk only sounds good, and in reality, it is not a thorough solution to women's problems. If women are truly economically independent, they can no longer be bound by their husbands. However, in this tide of unemployment, is it easy for women to find a job? That's hard to say. If they can't find a job, they are still not economically independent, wouldn't they still be subjugated to the power of men?</p>
<p>Therefore, in the current situation, in your situation, you can at most get some economic compensation, and this compensation is not necessarily very guaranteed if your husband is poor. As for a thorough solution and to prevent the occurrence of pain like yours, we can only hope for the coming of a society in the future where everyone has a job.</p>
<p>Novel: The Poor Gentleman (7)</p>
<p>Translated by Sun Pu</p>
<p>Now, Dingbali has not completely lost the hope of returning to his inherent society, which lies in the fact that he has carefully preserved a night suit and a pair of patent leather shoes that are still decent. Many times, he was very tempted to sell these seemingly superfluous things; and more than once, in the impoverished tail end of his four quarterly interest collections, the suit had pawned for a few shillings; but separating from the most supreme symbol of decency was a painful thing - this was inconsistent with Mr. Dingbali's passive and enduring mood. His ornaments, even the watch chain, had already been sold - such trifles were not something a gentleman's decorations could lack. He now rejoiced in his own carefulness, because the meeting with Mrs. Kalman was making him happy and also making it difficult for him, and thinking of that social evening was setting his heart on fire. He hurried home; he examined the formal attire with uneasy caution, and did not find too many shortcomings. A shirt, a stiff collar, and a tie were necessary to purchase; fortunately, he still had money. But how could he explain himself? Could he describe the address of his residence, his astonishing poverty? To do so would be tantamount to begging for the sympathy of his old friends, and he was aghast at daring to take this step. If possible, a gentleman should not reveal painful circumstances, so was it necessary to fabricate a lie? Furthermore, telling the whole truth was tantamount to blaming Mrs. Kalman's husband - this kind of insolence he could not endure.</p>
<p>The next evening, he was still troubled by this difficult situation. He had not yet made any decision when he arrived at Mrs. Kalman's house. There were three people waiting for him in the guest room - the hostess, her daughter and son-in-law, and the Weier couple. The warmth with which he was received almost brought tears to his eyes; overcome by many emotions, his mind was confused. He spoke casually; and as a result, he fabricated a bizarre lie, which even he himself was stunned by as soon as he finished speaking.</p>
<p>The beginning of the story was answering the natural question of where he lived.</p>
<p>Now - he laughed meaninglessly - I rent a room and guest room on a small street in Islington.</p>
<p>Dead silence ensued. Astonished eyes were fixed on him. If it weren't for these gazes, who would have known what kind of confession Mr. Dingbali had made? But in reality...</p>
<p>Mrs. Kalman, I said that I must confess to a quirk. I hope you will not be surprised. Simply put, I have dedicated my poor efforts to social work, living among the poor, as one of them, in order to gain some knowledge that cannot be obtained otherwise.</p>
<p>Ah, how noble! the hostess exclaimed.</p>

<p>Republic of China 23rd Year, May 15th, Tuesday</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Screen Section</p>
<p>Some Aspects of Greta Garbo's Adoration (Part 2)</p>
<p>Xi Lin</p>
<p>It is a very strange fact that many stars who work in the same company as Greta Garbo have never met this Swedish eccentric actress. Take Raymond Novarro, for example. His studio was next door to Garbo's, and his dressing room was only a few steps away from Garbo's, but they had never seen each other in six years until they co-starred in Mata Hari. Louis Stone has co-starred with Garbo in many films, but he himself has said to friends that he has never exchanged private conversations with Garbo except for contacting her to complete the filming task. Garbo is indifferent and unconcerned about the general public who worship her. There are no Garbo support societies in Hollywood. Garbo has never made any speeches to her supporters. She has never replied to a single letter from her supporters, nor has she signed a photograph to send to her supporters. However, it is difficult for anyone's supporters to compare with the enthusiasm and love of Garbo's supporters. The enthusiasm of Garbo's supporters can be said to be almost fanatical.</p>
<p>If a film magazine publishes any unflattering remarks about Garbo, it will immediately receive countless protest letters. If you read those letters, you will definitely think that you have committed some great disrespect or blasphemy. Hero worship is not so enthusiastic. Religious fanaticism is not so sincere. A radio broadcaster said a few slightly humorous words about Garbo on the radio. The next day, he received five hundred letters scolding him.</p>
<p>Offering is a way of showing reverence to God. Garbo is also often offered. Several years ago, an unknown person sent her a bouquet of orchids, considered the most precious in foreign countries, called Orchids, every day. The box had the name of a flower shop, but an investigation from the flower shop revealed that they did not know who the flower buyer was. Garbo received them every day and didn't ask about it. Someone told her that they could find a way to stop it, but Garbo said, "Let him go. Everyone seeks peace of mind, or maybe he feels at ease this way?" Later, she found out that the flower sender was a wealthy lawyer in De Qu Luo Yi, and she immediately stopped accepting them. Later, the lawyer sent her a picture of her book and asked her to sign it. She signed it. How lucky the lawyer was, because she rarely signed and gave autographs to people. There are so many people all over the world who send her gifts, but she returns them all unopened. She only loves flowers, especially those precious orchids.</p>
<p>From Greta's point of view, no one in the world is important or unimportant. When the Crown Prince of Sweden traveled to the United States, he wanted to meet her because his country had produced such a big star, but she refused to see him. The American people considered the greatest journalist of the time came to Hollywood. He was friends with John Barrymore, so he came to the studio to visit him and watch him film. At that time, Garbo was filming "Grand Hotel" with Barrymore. Suddenly, Garbo stopped. She walked up to Barrymore and said to him, "John, I'm very sorry, let's wait a while before filming." After she finished speaking, she turned and went back to her dressing room. Barrymore chased after her and said, "That's Asare Reisbon, the most famous news editor and writer in the world-" Garbo said, "But, John, do you think Mr. Brisbane would be willing for me to walk into his office and look over his shoulder while he is writing?" There are many things like this she does. When she is filming, she never allows strangers to watch. Many important staff members of MGM have never seen her film. Her eccentricities are so great, and she can be so admired, but no one has ever been able to figure out the mystery of why. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Commentary: "A Good Girl" Review</p>
<p>Luo Ping</p>
<p>That's a Good Girl</p>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>As if suffering from homesickness, when all the boring nonsense touched my eyes, I sat almost withered in the darkness for two hours.</p>
<p>I sat silently. For the unnatural singing, shallow and boring dancing, and contrived laughter in "A Good Girl," what else can I say?</p>
<p>The story is about a person who owes a lot of money and is going to inherit his uncle's huge inheritance, and falls in love with a woman in the hotel. It's so empty that we can't see any social background or the personality of the characters in the play. Songs, dances, and jumps are all there is to "A Good Girl."</p>
<p>Dialogues and songs enter our eardrums word by word or sentence by sentence. We understand the meaning, but in the end, we won't understand what this is all about!</p>
<p>Jumping up inexplicably, singing inexplicably, chasing and running away inexplicably, quarreling inexplicably, all the films are occupied by these boring contrivances.</p>
<p>However, if it is as fresh as advertised, there is still something to say; but the consistent old tunes of British musical comedies, falls, hits, breaking bottles, making jokes on stage, and a grand reunion ending are all old and inevitably tiresome.</p>
<p>The two people's talking and singing, winking, jumping and chasing, are a bit like Chinese double acts, but, unfortunately, this kind of double act-style slapstick occupies the entirety of "A Good Girl." If these were in the early days of sound films, they would naturally have their meaning, but today, we have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Jack Buchanan's previous "Blossom Time" was somewhat commendable, but "A Good Girl" is far inferior. The starring role and director are both Jack. This script is simply written for his personal nonsense.</p>
<p>He is not only not equal to Chevalier, but can only be said to have reached the same end as Walter Wheeler, equally boring.</p>
<p>A Question Raised by "Kameradschaft"</p>
<p>Hu Yue</p>
<p>Although "Kameradschaft" was lightly passed over by Shanghai's film audiences and film critics, it is, as it has been said somewhere, very serious in its meaning that it met with Chinese audiences on Labor Day in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Under Pabst's somber and magnificent "brushstrokes," we were moved by the great ethical concepts of the people and the internationalism that overturned the thick walls between humans. Naturally, like "The Outcast," "Kameradschaft" is a crude and straightforward rather than elegant and sophisticated work, and because it was produced as early as 1931, it was limited by the general technical standards of the time, and some parts can be criticized when reviewed.</p>
<p>We should also pay attention to the shortcomings mentioned in the joint review of the three writers of this magazine; if "Kameradschaft" could deepen its theme further, that is to say, if it were more realistic, then the point that national prejudice and underground barriers were built up by whom could also be told to us. Now, all there is here is amazement and anger at this kind of wall, and it stops only a hair's breadth away.</p>
<p>What also moves us is the depiction of the difficulty of German and French miners shaking hands in the absence of a common language. Almost all aspects of "Kameradschaft" have been criticized, but few people have paid attention to this point. Let's put aside the other aspects of this documentary film, the question of how the people closely shook hands should obviously not be ignored. "Kameradschaft" just seriously raised this question.</p>
<p>We believe that every viewer, seeing the anxiety and impatience of the trapped German workers when they could not communicate in the same language, immediately felt that this was a very serious problem. However, it seems that no one has noticed that "Kameradschaft" raised this question.</p>
<p>The imperialist policy of division has built high walls of national arrogance among the people in various places, and even used language to build thick walls, cutting off the communication of feelings between nations.</p>
<p>In "Kameradschaft," we feel that we need a language that can be commonly used by all nations in the world. Of course, Esperanto has considerable value and achievement, but its power in the East is still very weak. Whether there will be a true Universal Language in the future is a very meaningful question.</p>
<p>Gloria Swanson Will Soon Return to the Screen</p>
<p>Fu</p>
<p>Old-brand charming star Gloria Swanson, ever since a moment of folly many years ago, wanting to have children and become a virtuous wife and good mother, gave up her film career, and many years have passed in a flash. Although she has not been completely forgotten by the generally forgetful audience, but as time flies, wanting to return to the screen and spend her brilliant career, she has already found it difficult. However, her desire to return is very strong, and her struggle is also very strong. Now, where there is a will, there is a way. News has come that she has won the sympathy of the MGM authorities and has been given a contract. MGM is looking for a suitable script for her. It is said that the Three Weeks written by Elinor Glyn has recently been selected. MGM was originally a place where stars gathered. The existing female stars, such as Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Helen Hayes, Marlene Dietrich, etc., are more than enough. Now that another Swanson has been added, it is of course very fortunate. However, she is already a middle-aged woman, not suitable for playing young girls anymore. In the future, how much appeal she will have still needs to be waited and seen.</p>
<p>Hollywood Divorce and Marriage Statistics</p>
<p>Dong Lin</p>
<p>Many people say that the year 1933 was Hollywood's biggest divorce year. But according to statistics, there were only twenty-five couples who divorced last year, but there were thirty-one couples who married. But in 1932, there were thirty-seven couples who divorced and thirty-two couples who married.</p>
<p>We don't need to use percentages to know that the number of divorces in 1933 was indeed much less than in 1932, but why don't people say that 1932 was the biggest divorce year?</p>
<p>This is because there were two months last year when there were consecutive divorces in Hollywood, and the protagonists of these divorces were all big figures in the film industry!</p>
<p>Film Novel: Happy Enemies (2)</p>
<p>Long Geng</p>
<p>Wang Yuhe, a section member in an agency, a wandering person without parents. He loves Guiying, he truly loves Guiying. He once presented a bouquet of flowers with his hot true feelings to Guiying. Although Guiying had just suffered a new shock and was hating all men, this could not erase her youthful enthusiasm. Wang Yuhe's true feelings then exchanged for Guiying's love.</p>
<p>In the house of Ji Cai, in the garden of Yuhe's house, surrounded by flowers, they began their sweet intoxication and enjoyment of "love." Bai Guiying was like a withered rose again, re-opening its deep red petals.</p>
<p>However, Wang Yuhe's uncle-in-law did not allow his enthusiasm to burn on a female actress, to humiliate his family's reputation. He said that acting in plays was not a proper profession, and at the same time, he insulted all the people who acted in plays - even though Bai Guiying had already acted in plays. However, Wang Yuhe could not live without emotions. He explained, he pleaded, he wanted his uncle-in-law to understand, he wanted his uncle-in-law to allow him to love Bai Guiying. However, the uncle-in-law was stubborn. He hit the table hard and ordered Wang Yuhe, if you want to love her, you leave here.</p>
<p>Love is sacrifice. Wang Yuhe could not interrupt his fiery love for the obstruction of his uncle-in-law. He was prepared to painfully break away from his uncle-in-law, and he resolutely left here.</p>
<p>However, Bai Guiying was outside the door and understood everything. She stopped Wang Yuhe who was about to leave, and she persuaded Yuhe to obey the teachings of his uncle-in-law. She was willing for Yuhe to forget her. She was willing to sacrifice her love to fulfill the feelings of Yuhe's uncle-in-law. She was again a great rose.</p>
<p>However, Wang Yuhe always loved Bai Guiying. He bravely and resolutely broke away from the house of his uncle-in-law and came to Bai Guiying's place, wanting to reclaim his sacred love.</p>
<p>Bai Guiying's young heart is now beginning to wander. She loves Yuhe, but she cannot be close to Yuhe. At the same time, Guiying's mother is demanding that Guiying resume her stage career.</p>
<p>She angrily rejected her mother's demands. She understood that she could no longer live her acting life. Her rejection was to hope that she would no longer be looked down upon, but how would she answer the lovely and pitiful Wang Yuhe?</p>
<p>Fervent emotions finally broke through reason. Bai Guiying boldly and calmly took Wang Yuhe's hand and walked the path of "realizing love."</p>
<p>She once threatened to commit suicide to force her stubborn mother to allow her to marry Wang Yuhe, because Bai Guiying's mother despised Yuhe for being a "small section member" and a "poor wretch," and resolutely refused their union. This result was fulfilled with the help of Cheng Qiuyun.</p>
<p>However, further misfortune suddenly struck the active couple. Wang Yuhe was dismissed for neglecting his official duties in order to prepare for the wedding (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Advisory Committee of the League of Nations and the Issue of Pseudo-Postal Services</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>As previously reported, on February 16th of this year, the British government notified Mr. Avenol, Secretary-General of the League of Nations, that the London Post Office had received a letter from the "Manchukuo" Postal Administration requesting that various statistical tables be sent to "Manchukuo" in accordance with the Universal Postal Convention. This would facilitate the settlement of postage fees for mail transiting through "Manchukuo." The British government was eager to know to what extent foreign postal services were practically involved with the "Manchukuo" postal service without implying recognition of the existing organization in Manchuria. Upon receiving the notification, Mr. Avenol decided to convene the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee on May 14th to study methods that would allow the postal regulations to be implemented between various countries and the Manchurian region without causing any country to be suspected of recognizing "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>On March 13th, Mr. Wenden, the British Postmaster General, stated in the House of Commons that the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations would convene on May 14th to consider the British postal issue concerning "Manchukuo." The British government has consistently maintained its stance on the issue of recognition. On April 16th and 26th, the British House of Commons continued its discussion of the issue of postal relations with the pseudo-state.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the British government's foreign policy includes the sincerity and necessity of maintaining the prestige of the League of Nations. Its suggestion to discuss the issue of relations with pseudo-postal services should not contain any motive to overturn the League's non-recognition principle, thereby completely destroying the only concrete achievement and remaining prestige of the League of Nations' handling of the Manchurian issue, and consequently affecting the British Empire's original intention to uphold the League. However, we still feel that seeking a satisfactory solution in the narrow space between implementing the postal convention in pseudo-Manchukuo and the principle of non-recognition is not only difficult to start, but simply impossible. If the British government cannot propose a concrete proposal for discussion, how can the Advisory Committee come up with a novel idea?</p>
<p>Moreover, the method of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" has already been approved by the Advisory Committee and sent to the member states of the League of Nations and non-member states that had previously received the General Assembly report in the form of a notification by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The issue of postal services and stamps was one of the seven items discussed at the time. The Chinese government had previously requested the Universal Postal Union to notify its member states of three points: (1) All Manchurian postal services should be temporarily suspended. (2) All mail sent to Europe and the United States will subsequently be delivered via the Suez Canal and the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese government requests that the postal administrations of all member states adopt the same approach for mail sent to China. (3) All stamps issued by the puppet government are invalid. This recommendation was forwarded by the Advisory Committee to the member states of the League of Nations for their attention. If any member state can fully respect the position of the Advisory Committee and the Chinese government, there would be no "mail transiting through Manchuria," and therefore no basis for the pseudo-Manchukuo postal administration to demand the settlement of postage fees.</p>
<p>Recent telegraphs stated that the Advisory Committee will find the British proposal difficult and will likely transfer it to the Universal Postal Union for a decision, in order to evade responsibility. However, the pseudo-Manchukuo's request for postage settlement is based on the provisions of the Postal Convention. Yet, pseudo-Manchukuo itself is not a member of the Universal Postal Union. Furthermore, even if it wished to join the convention in the future, the Advisory Committee has specifically advised the Swiss government to express its opposition when it submits its request. It is clear that transferring the matter to the Universal Postal Union will not change the facts in the slightest. When the Advisory Committee proposed the draft on non-recognition of "Manchukuo," it mistakenly included "Manchukuo" in the same category as opium, suggesting that governments be allowed to issue passports for opium transported to "Manchukuo." Fortunately, the Council of the League of Nations corrected this error in time, preventing the erroneous act of recognizing pseudo-Manchukuo. This time, we sincerely hope that the committee will act cautiously and avoid repeating the same mistake. In February of this year, the Shanghai Foreign Association cabled the International Postal Congress meeting in Egypt, complaining about the slow delivery of mail sent from Europe to Shanghai via Siberia, requesting the Congress's efforts to expedite the delivery of mail via Siberia. We certainly sympathize with the suffering experienced by the foreign community, but we deeply believe that their governments should seriously negotiate with Japan. Chinese postal authorities and third parties cannot be held responsible and have no way to remedy the situation. We hold the same view regarding the British proposal to the Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>One of the important missions of the Advisory Committee is to study all the issues arising from the denial of "Manchukuo." The nature of the issues may vary, but they should all be aligned with the principle of non-recognition. Although we deeply believe that the British proposal stems from pure motives, it is almost certain that its outcome will affect the principle of non-recognition. In this sense, we cannot but express our firm opposition.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the Lytton Report, the Japanese have become increasingly blatant in challenging the League of Nations. For the sake of the League's prestige, it is necessary to actively strengthen its original position and not allow it to soften any further. The British government, which has consistently maintained the League of Nations as its diplomatic cornerstone, should feel the same way.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Tragedy in Hong Kong: Sudden Explosion of Gas Storage Tank, Surrounding Houses Engulfed in Flames, Residents Unable to Escape, Number of Casualties Still Unknown, Estimated to be No Fewer Than a Thousand</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) At 10:00 AM this morning, a gas storage tank at the Hong Kong Shek Tong Tsui Gas Company exploded. Gas leaked out and ignited upon contact with fire, instantly setting ablaze thirteen nearby residential buildings, including six on Tsing Shing Street, six on Kalun Street, and one on Yu On Terrace. The fire was extinguished by 3:00 PM. Afterward, eleven bodies were found at the scene, with over sixty people missing and more than 120 injured. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) At 11:00 AM on the 14th, the gas tank of the Hong Kong Western District Shek Tong Tsui Gas Company suddenly exploded. The opening was about three feet wide and thirty feet long. Gas leaked out and was blown around by the wind. Houses at No. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 Kalun Terrace, No. 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 Tsing Shing Street, and No. 1 Yu On Terrace were instantly engulfed in flames. Residents panicked and were unable to escape. Over twenty people were killed on the spot and transported to the National Hospital or funeral homes. About thirty to forty injured people were admitted to hospitals, with countless others treating themselves. The number of those buried alive in the fire is unknown as excavation has not yet begun, but it is generally estimated to be over a hundred. The fire was brought under control around 1:00 PM. All fire brigades, emergency response teams, and ambulance teams in Hong Kong were mobilized and dispatched to the scene. This is truly an unprecedented disaster for Hong Kong. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) There are two theories regarding the cause of the gas tank explosion at the Hong Kong Gas Company. One theory suggests that some kind of explosive was shot into the tank from nearby Kalun Street, causing the gas to ignite. The other theory is that the tank, which has been in operation for eighty-three years, had corroded ore plates, causing the gas to leak out. Insurance companies have dispatched staff to the scene to investigate. The presiding judge of the Central Magistracy, government photographers, forensic examiners, and medical examiners have also personally gone to investigate the bodies in order to hold a court hearing soon. According to eyewitnesses, the gas tank was about seventy feet high and fifty feet in diameter. With a loud bang, the entire area shook, and residents fled in panic, not knowing where to go. When the gas shot out, it reached a height of about ten feet, and anyone caught in it was immediately burned to death. The scene was extremely tragic. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Following the tragic explosion at the Hong Kong Gas Company's gas tank, a total of 124 injured people were admitted to hospitals, half of whom were women and children. The bodies of fifty-two people who were burned to death have been found. The fire brigade is still excavating day and night, as over a hundred people are still missing and feared buried in the rubble. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tonight, rescue teams are still clearing the rubble and searching for bodies. Twenty-seven more bodies have been recovered, and it is believed that more will be found. Hong Kong Governor Sir Peel visited the disaster area this afternoon and issued a statement expressing his shock and grief over the tragedy and conveying the government's condolences to the families of the victims. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) This morning, a large gas leak occurred at the Hong Kong Sai Kok gas plant, causing a fire and explosion in the workers' residences across the street. The force was so strong that some nearby residential buildings were completely lifted up. Flames erupted in all directions, and all fire brigades on the island rushed to the scene to provide assistance. A Reuters reporter who rushed to the scene saw firefighters carrying bodies, some of which were so badly burned that they were difficult to identify. The scene was extremely tragic. As of 1:00 PM, a total of ten bodies had been found, and it is feared that many more are buried in the rubble. About a hundred people have been taken to hospitals, most of whom are severely burned and on the verge of death. Few seem likely to recover. In addition to the dead and injured, it is reported that sixty people are still missing. Several Europeans also participated in the rescue work. A priest who serves as the principal of a nearby Catholic church school courageously rushed into the fire zone and rescued many people. The Reuters reporter saw injured women in the fire zone crying out in pain, searching for their husbands and children. The scene was extremely tragic. There were also men working outside who rushed to the scene after hearing the news, searching for their families, appearing frantic. The majority of the dead and injured were women and children, as most of the men were already out working. Strangely, the gas plant itself was not damaged, and the employees, except for a few who suffered minor injuries, escaped safely. The fire burned for twenty hours before it was extinguished. When the fire was raging, a woman ran naked into the street, her clothes completely burned off, her body covered in burns. Residents near the fire zone were shocked and terrified, and no one knew the real situation. Medical students from the University of Hong Kong also joined the rescue effort. The fire zone is now a scene of rubble, too tragic to witness, causing some to weep. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Today's fire is one of the greatest tragedies in Hong Kong's history. Even tonight, it is impossible to estimate the exact number of casualties. The explosion occurred around 10:55 AM. A three-story building across from the gas plant was instantly engulfed in flames. Due to strong winds, the fire spread rapidly. Because the disaster struck suddenly, people inside the building were unable to escape. In an instant, a nearby building was also surrounded by flames. The chaotic scene was indescribable. Thousands of panicked people rushed to safer areas. All emergency teams in Hong Kong were dispatched to the fire zone. Dozens of people collapsed on the ground when the explosion occurred, and the cries for help from those trapped inside the burning buildings were heartbreaking. The first fire brigade and a police team arrived at the scene and immediately began clearing onlookers from the streets and starting rescue work. They helped those who had fallen on the street and rescued those who had jumped from the windows on the second and third floors. Their clothes and hair were on fire. Many of them broke their necks and bones upon landing. A Chinese translator named Lan Dong (transliteration) from the University of Hong Kong was severely injured and in critical condition. Two Indian guards were also seriously injured. The residents of the area are all Chinese, so all the victims, except for the two Indians, are also Chinese. According to eyewitnesses, Father Vicarini of St. Anthony's Church was particularly courageous in rescuing people, fearlessly rushing into the burning buildings and guiding panicked women and children to safety. He repeatedly carried several children in his arms out of the fire. The exact number of deaths is still difficult to estimate, but the number of injured may exceed a thousand.

<h3>Memorial Weeks at the Central Government and the National Government: Reports</h3>
<p>Chen Ce: Situation of European and American Navies</p>
<p>Ju Zheng: Only Chinese People Can Save China</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 130th Memorial Week on the morning of the 14th. About 500 people attended, including Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Chen Ce, Li Ciwen, Li Zonghuang, Ji Liang, Ke Xing'e, Xiao Jishan, and staff members. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Chen Ce reported on his inspection of European and American navies last year, stating briefly that the navies of various countries have recently adapted to their needs and established new policies. For example, Britain relies on the navy as its main force, the United States emphasizes both land, sea, and air forces, and focuses on submarines, Italy emphasizes torpedo boats, and Germany emphasizes small-tonnage warships. It can be seen that the navy occupies a very important position in national defense. Our country has the Pacific Ocean as its gateway, but now the river defense is not even solid, how can we talk about coastal defense? However, the navy has the effect of assisting the land and air forces to strengthen national defense and should quickly learn from the strengths of various countries to immediately establish a new naval policy to save the country from danger. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Memorial Week on the morning of the 14th. Ju Zheng, Deng Jiayan, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, Cao Haosen, Li Yuanding, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 300 officials from various ministries and departments attended. Chairman Lin led the attendees in paying their respects. Ju Zheng then reported on "Only Chinese People Can Save China," stating briefly that since Japan forcibly interfered in our country's cooperation with international bodies and issued its so-called declaration, the Chinese people have felt a new diplomatic stimulus. Diplomatic problems have naturally become difficult for our country, and at the same time, they have caused the great powers to feel the impact internationally. To cope with the crisis, we must rise up and rescue ourselves, calmly respond appropriately, and take advantage of this urgent situation to promote positive progress in domestic affairs. We believe that Chinese people can save China. Those who are familiar with Roman history can feel that the current Chinese nation is following in the footsteps of the Roman nation. Only people within Rome can control the Roman language. We should change the tone of that statement to "Only the people of China can solve China's problems." (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
