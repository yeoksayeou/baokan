<p>時評</p>
<h3>德意妥恊後之歐局</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>自希脫拉執政迄今。德國外交始终陷於孤立地位。英雖間或假以辭色。實則不過周旋於法德之間。以調人自居而已。英非纯粹歐洲性之國家。顧慮多端。自難望其遽有切實之援助也。至於法國。則因希脫拉之崛起而振振有辭。遂得利用國際形勢。使希氏陷於本國勢力大包圍之下。他若奥局之棘手。俄人之飛躍亦在。在使希氏感覺難堪。此其所以有意大利之行也。</p>
<p>方意德二雄之會談也。屏絕侍從。關防森嚴。局外人自難明其眞相所在。惟最近電訊。則謂其要點凡三。（一）此後對於國際問題。兩國採取恊商政策。（二）德國承認奧國獨立。以意國承認德國軍備平等爲條件。（三）兩國對多瑙河各國經濟合作。就此數點而觀。意德雖尙未簽訂何種恊定。然政治經濟雙方。從此將開一新紀元。或無疑問。结果雖謂意奧匈集團擴大。而成爲意德奧匈之集國亦無不可。蓋意奧匈之恊定。目的亦在政治經濟之合作。與意德兩雄今次之會談實無二致也。</p>
<p>若就經濟的立塲言。則意德之合作。其利益尤遠在意奧匈合作之上。憑過</p>
<p>去此四國之貿易數字而論。意與奧匈之貿易。不及意德貿易遠甚。故意奧匈之結合。其意義偏重於政治的。而意德之結合則兼重政治與經濟也。且奧匈之對外貿易。歷來亦以德居首位。故德而眞能加入意奧匈三國之集團。經濟上實能相得益彰德。與奧匈向爲同盟國家。卽意大利於歐戰前亦與有淵源。今以時勢之相需。而重復合作。本爲極自然之動作。四國領土相毘連。聲息相溝通。一旦戰事發生。其地位實遠勝於法國集團。此足増强意德勢力。固意中事也。</p>
<p>唯其如是。故意德今次之妥恊。對於歐局前途影響極大。簡而言之。實具抵消俄法结合之效力。此爲德國希脫拉登台後第一次之外交勝利。希氏返國之後。又將有波蘭之行。其意在於對俄。甚爲明顯。然能否成功。不能無疑。窺希氏之意。以爲德若侵俄。當可得英之默視。法若出助。則有意大利爲之牽掣。故向此途發展。窒礙較少。事成之後。再以坐大之勢。徐謀對法。當無不利。然由吾人觀之。意德之合作。雖有减削法俄结合之功能。若謂德國於此卽可自由對俄。亦殊難能。蓋意德今次之合作。雖足增强歐洲反法反俄之勢力。同時亦足使法俄之结合。隨之加强。英法之關係。轉而和洽。蓋英之所以屡次助德抑法者。以德弱法强耳。意德携手之後。法之勢力。已無形减損。英之目的。謂已有部份之達到。忌法之心。自必隨而轉淡。再則意大利爲地中海之國家。若其國力過盛。或竟凌駕法國。當非英國之利。英國爲保持其印度之通道計。自不容地中海上有一過强之國家。今次意國擴建海軍。所以遭英國之側目者。其敌卽在於是。故爲英國計。必以保持法意地中海之均勢爲有利。不欲使意大利之實力過强也。</p>
<p>一言以蔽之。意德之携手成。則歐洲新均勢之局面現。無論何國。倉卒言戰。必無勝算。故其结果。必將益呈鈎心鬥角之奇觀。以等待最後大爆發之降臨焉。</p>

<h3>希特勒之演說　痛詆合縱連横政策　威尼斯會後第一聲</h3>
<p>（柏林）　昨晚希特勒總理在某處演說、痛詆列强之合縱連横傾向、此係希特勒與墨索里尼在威尼斯舉行重大會議、回國後之第一次演說、其言實對法俄同盟計晝而發、希特勒宣稱、「世界愈益宣揚合緃連横政策、則吾人愈有維持吾人權力之必要、吾人並未與其他民族結成任何集團、但吾人務須留意、此項集團必不撼動德人之地位、或者問曰、國家社會黨苟要求德國之平等、則吾人不得不實行武裝、吾人答曰、以吾人自身而論、此固能爲、因吾人無意攻擊他人也、吾人僅欲自强至某種程度、他國庶可因此放弃其侵略吾人之野心、吾人處理國事、尙應接不暇、而其他民族當亦以興修内政爲念、各國政治家如能分其一部分對付國外之精力、從事改革内政、則世界之改善定非淺鮮」云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　今日德總統希特勒於返柏林途中之吉拉地方演說、略謂吾人對於他國不抱陰謀、亦覺他人陰謀不能毁滅德國、全國志願之團結、較諸大砲與坦克車尤爲有力、吾人雖極爱和平、德國雖極不願有戰爭、但吾必竭力維護德國之自由與榮譽、德國已作許多可能工作以期致世界之和平、吾人不獨敎導民衆自衛、且亦示以保障他人權利之道、他國領袖蓋亦表示此種精神云、按此爲德總理在威尼斯會議後之第一次演說、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>蓋拉　此間國社黨舉行地方大會、總理希特勒趕至參加、發表演說、謂德國已感覺其本身之力量、其言曰「外國人問德國何所欲者、吾人將答以無諭國内國外、吾德惟求旁人之不干涉、如有人詢予將何所作爲、以謀世界之和平、吾將答以吾輩訓練七千萬人民、使其自行尊重、並能尊重他人之權利、又謂已盡吾人之能力、吾人惟望其他國家之當局、亦能使其人民、尊重吾德之生存權利、吾儕國社黨、對内有極大計晝、尙待實行、故吾人有尋覔和平、與各國友誼之義務、吾人尤須使他國對德不加干涉、各國報紙均應對世界和平之維持、予以援助、凡與和平相反之分子、報界不當供其利用」云云、希氏又謂、「凡能追憶歐戰之錯誤、而切盼各民族之調和者」、德國望其成功、「其在國際上徒使挑撥、至戰爭發生、則不願置身疆塲者」、則爲德國所反對、談及軍備權利平等時、希氏謂「吾德生存之權、决不容人置喙、有謂德國如欲軍備平等、則他國卽當更擴充軍備者、吾人將答以儘可如此行之、蓋吾人之目的、僅在有充分之力量、足以防止他人攻擊德國之野心、德國之志、固不在攻擊他人也、吾可對全世界擔保、德國有絕對維持和平之志願、而絕無好戰之心、故實際上吾人之行動、只在保障德國民族之自由、與榮譽耳、」希氏演說時、歡呼聲不絕於耳、旋放禮砲、繼以國社黨之行列、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　伊斯維斯太報於論希特勒與墨索里尼在威尼斯會見之文中、指明希氏實未能避免關於奥國問題之談判而於此項問題、德意兩國適有確定而逕相反之觀點、此兩種相交之觀點中、僅有一種可意想之「妥洽」、此卽德國至少須暫停其在奧國之特種活動也、唯此種「妥洽」直等於法西斯之德國在國際戰塲上復經一次挫敗耳、「每日要聞報曽載意國願以維持國聯威信爲條件、贊成德國重返聯盟、此說如確、則卽以德國現政府之虔誠信從視之、此項價格亦不能與德國於其外交政策一基本問題上所作之讓步相等云、（十六日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>日本擴充空軍　陸軍當局銳意研究</h3>
<p>（東京）　陸軍當局現正趕製擴大航空部隊之計劃、前因第六十五議會通過農村救濟、海軍二次補充計晝預算未能實現此計晝、然至今情勢、航空部隊之擴大及、</p>
<p>充實爲必要之緊急事、陸軍省决定將此計晝所要經費列入明年度預算中、提交議會、要求通過、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　爲明年度陸軍預算核心之空軍擴充計晝、目下在當局銳意研究之中、尙未完成、空軍之擴充於將來之國防旣爲最堪重視之事、故以空軍最活躍之歐洲大戰史爲重要參考資料、與以注意、歐洲戰爭之初期、英法德之一國平均陸軍機數爲二百三十三架、大戰末期之一國平均數爲八千五百架、一個月間之損耗率爲百分之二十乃至三十、現在英美法意俄五國之平均所有數爲二千四百架、約當歐戰初期之平均數三十六倍、若將來發生戰事時、空軍之發逹、推算與歐戰採同樣之經過、則未來戰之末期、一國之平均數應逹八萬六千架之多、未來戰初期與末期之全平均應爲四萬三千架、以此爲基礎、推算損耗率爲百分之二十五、則每月最少須補充一萬架、此自然不過極消極的推算而已、蓋歐戰初期、飛機偉力尙爲疑問、今日不然、其能力已充分被人承認、故今後之大戰、不能斷定必須歐戰當時之經過、因此非常時局、迫在目前之今日、空軍之擴充必爲大規模的、駕駛者平均最少須四萬三千人、而每月計算損失一萬人、則空軍擴充計晝須以下列三點、爲主要點、卽（一）飛機所有數之增加、（二）飛機製造施設及材料之充實、（三）駕駛者之充實、（十八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　將來戰爭時之國防第二綫現益覺重要、其中空軍尤占重要地位、空軍之最後决定、受制於民間航空事業之情形如何者居多、此乃當局之一致意見、若以民間航空駕駛者之數、由列國之現狀觀之、</p>
<p>美國　一八、五九四名、英國　　二、七六六名、法國　　一、一○○名、德國　　二、五○○名、均佔優勢、日本於昭和七年度時、僅有三九一名、不僅駕駛者、卽於製造飛機之能力等、日本最劣、若照此情形、雖若何充實航空兵力、亦難期日本空中國防之完備、故今陸軍頗留意於民間航空力之增進、（十八日電通電）</p>

<h3>風雨漂搖中的齋藤内閣日本通信　軍部旣不維持亦不倒閣　宇垣繼任組閣恐難實現</h3>
<p>掛起立憲招牌、實行武人專政的日本、近來的表現越發露骨了、原來黑田英雄受賄案揭穿之後、高橋卽不安於財長之位、齋藤因此而受牽累、但以海軍大功臣東鄉的病卒、一般新聞都集中於東鄉氏的記載１從他的生前功績到他的死後榮哀１於是轉移了一般的視綫、倒台運動本没有什麽力量　因此就更加鬆弛了、齋藤氏所以受了致命打擊依然繼續維持、在他自己與高橋財長的解釋、是要等到黑田案眞相判明之後、纔提出辭呈　現時還得稍事猶豫、同時有力者方面、特别是軍部、縱不肯積極支持現内閣、但也不肯積極的倒閣、而兩大旣成政黨、又都毫無生氣、他們因與自身没有利益、取不到内閣總理的地位、所以也不十分熱烈進行倒閣、</p>
<p>不過齋藤内閣的崩潰已經是必然要發生的事實、是客觀形勢形成了的、所差者是主觀的推動而已、齋藤一旦辭職之後、後繼的人現在呼聲最高的是朝鮮總督宇垣一成、並且黑田事件發生後、民政黨就派了三個人到朝鮮去、表面上說是視察朝鮮米市塲、及生產情形、與以後如何與日本内地產米調和的事、實際上則是去和宇垣氏商量繼任内閣問題、並歡迎他到東京一行、與各方面接洽、這事情雖然民政黨曾加以否認、但事實並不是偶然的擁宇垣上台的除民政黨以外、還有政友會中的床次竹二郎所領導一派、與久原房之助的一派、卽是所謂政民兩黨聯立派、如果宇垣組閣其基礎是是在民政黨和政友會的床次·久原兩派、眞演成事實的話、恐怕政友會卽不免分裂了　這是政友會幹部正在設法防止的事、</p>
<p>至於反對宇垣登台的人、最主要的是軍部、其所以反對他的原因、據一般公開的說法、是陸軍中堅幹部不滿於　宇垣的缓進政策、尤不滿於宇垣之接近政黨、恐怕宇垣上台之後、將扶助財閥的發展、致軍部的侵略政策不能澈底實行、其實這不過是許多原因之一、其内部旣有種種勢力的相互對立、宇垣是陸軍行政　派的頭目、從前他在陸軍大臣任内、曾借陸軍整理之名、犠牲過許多中下級幹部、這些人現時都屬於荒木派、所以含恨甚深、反感極烈、此時宇垣登台不致於　强提整理陸軍的計劃、但是荒木派對他依　舊不肯表示贊同　這是可想而知的、</p>
<p>在海軍方面對宇垣本無惡感、而且還有一部分青年軍人表示好意、卽現任海相大角也寄與若干同情、所以海軍普及委員長坂野常善少將、發表一個單獨申明說、「海軍方面不反對宇垣内閣」這事情正當宇垣到東京的時候、可說是爲宇垣氏個人生色不少、但是反而因　此惹出是非來了、第一是海軍主腦人物如海相、如海軍軍令部部長、事前都不知道　這件事</p>
<p>在意識上固然默認宇垣組閣、但還没明白表示、這様一聲明、反惹起陸軍方面的不快、第二是坂野申明顯示　海陸軍的意見歧異、更引起社會上的猜疑、所以海軍部下令免去坂野的普及委員長職務、藉以表白海軍對内閣繼任人選的意見、因此宇垣上台、反而發生出特别　的阻碍來了、</p>
<p>至於日本内閣更動、無論繼任者是什麽人、不管是宇垣·是淸浦·還是齋藤再拜受大命、就整個情形而論、仍須受制於軍部　充分表現法西斯化的色彩、其對外關係、特别是對華關係、不但是要照預定的計劃進行侵略、熱河鐵道成功以後、還會向西窺進、並且還要製造新事實、挑動另外的事變、以加緊其所謂的非常時期、助</p>
<p>長軍部挾制内閣的權力、所以繼任内閣無論是誰、依舊是軍部的傀儡而已、（六月十三日於東京）</p>

<h3>軍校十週紀念　蔣校長訓詞原文</h3>
<p>中央軍校十週年紀念會、蔣校長出席訓詞、原文如下、</p>
<p>「各位同志、今天本校舉行成立十週年紀念大會、我們在紀念的時候　應當要想到十年以來、尤其是最初創辦時所經過一切艱難困苦的情形、昨天我做了一篇「十年來革命經過之回顧」的論文、關於十年以來中國革命歴史、亦可說是本校革命經過的歴史、惟有關於本校最初艱難創造的情形、或許有許多學生還不知道、所以在這十週年紀念的時候、我要簡單的向大家報吿一下、本校的開創、是在國民革命最困頓的時候、是在反動軍隊和一切恶勢力包圍的一個環境當中、當時總理雖然是大元帥、但是不能發一個有效的命令、更不能如願的實行一點主義、革命的勢力、在反革命的空氣包圍籠罩之下、不能活動　下、當時總理在困頓抑鬱之中、千辛萬苦來創辦我們黃埔軍校、來要奠定革命武力之基礎、完成國民革命的事業、在開創的時候、黃埔學校的地址、還被其他的軍隊佔住、總理下手令要他們遷移、他們都不理會、後來和他們辛辛苦苦的再三要求、然後才遷出、他們遷出以後、雖有了黄埔一片乾凈土作我們的校址、然而當時本校校舍之簡陋、有很多同學都親自住過或看見過的、不僅不堪做一個軍官學校、不能如現在之高大完美、就是供一營部隊長期駐紥、也不相宜、但是我們總理當時除了黃埔以外、更找不到第二個革命的立足點、所以就以黃埔彈丸之地、困陋就簡、來開創這個學校、第一期自民國十三年的今日開學、到十二月就出發東江討逆、這六個月當中、時時刻刻都是在一切反革命勢力包圍嫉忌之中、其困苦艱難的情形、實在不堪言狀、現在本校一般學生官長士兵、有這樣高大的房子可以住、有這樣完備器械可以用、吃得飽穿得暖、這種種都是十三年本校開創的時候所絕對得不到的、當時總理和廖黨代表以及一般同志創辦本校、是怎樣一種困難情形呢、不必說反革命的軍隊時時刻刻在輕視我們嫉視我們、隨時要來消滅我們、單是學校經費的困難一項　也就使本校受到萬分的苦痛　我只舉一個例來講一講、大家就可以白的、就是有一天、我們費盡心力還没有籌到伙食、第二天、就没有米可以煮飯、要斷炊了、當時還要到廣州去找廖黨代表、拿了三百塊錢買了米、運到黃埔、然後第二天才有飯吃、這種苦痛　你們一般學生、當時那裏知道呢、你們由這件事、就可以想見當時本校的情形、是如何的艱難困苦、但是我們就在這種環境當中、以六個月的短時間　訓練成功革命的勁旅　奠定革命武力的基歴、試想一般師生是如何的刻苦耐勞、如何的惕勵奮勇、我們今後要完成革命的事業、一定不可忘記、根本要永遠記得當時總理和廖黨代表以下一般同志、千辛萬苦來創辦本校的情形、廣東有句土話說、「偷偷摸摸」、當時總理和廖黨代表以下一般同志、眞是偷偷摸摸在忍飢挨餓艱難困苦之中、創辦了本校、我們今後所擔負的國民革命的工作、比過去十年還要格外的艱鉅、我們要想完成這些事業、盡到我們的責任、一定要比過去的十年、更要提起革命的精神、更比創辦本校的時期、要格外的刻苦耐勞、冒險犯難、矢勤矢勇、惕勵奮勉、來擔負這個使命、最重要的、我們要接受總理的革命精神、奠定革命的基礎、必須由刻苦耐勞做起、以上是專就最初半年中生活環境一方面來講本校創始的情形、現在再要將初期奮鬥的情形講一講、本校在開學的時候、不過有五百個學生、除死亡或被淘汰者以外、到畢業的時候、只剩了四百五十名、大家曉得我們成立軍官學校來訓練學生、最要緊的是武器、最初五百人的步槍、是從那裏來的呢、當時廣州兵工厰已爲軍閥所把持、就是大元帥府想領一桿槍、也要向軍閥苦求、幸虧當時兵工廠的廠長、還是我們革命黨的一個黨員、他奉到大元帥的命令、才偷偷摸摸的用了兩三個月的苦心、偷了五百餘條步槍給我們黄埔軍校、我們就是拿了這五百條步槍來訓練學生軍、來與四方八面一切惡劣的環境反革命的勢力奮鬥、當初一般軍官、看見大元帥將這五百條槍發給黄埔軍校、以爲將來必要被陳炯明繳去、他們料我們學校就是這樣無用、但是我們拿了這五百條步槍、能够不斷的恶戰苦鬥、奠定最偉大革命武力的基礎、最初就是廣州的商團造反、並且勾結帝國主義者爲外援、各國帝國主義都很多兵艦開到廣州、就停在黄埔本校的前面、來威脅我們、但是我們就憑五百條步槍來和這幾十隻兵艦以及四面佈滿機關槍的惡劣環境奮鬥、無論敵人有多大的力量、無論他如何來威脅我們、我們始終奮鬥不懈、仍舊是每天出操上課、加緊的訓練、那　個帝國主義者、也不能來消滅我們、所以我們全體師生和全體同志以及各位將領、要知道我們當初只有五百條步槍、何以能奠定今日革命武力的基礎、進而掃除一切軍閥、抵抗一切帝國主義者呢、還完全是由於總理所傳授給我們的革命精神、亦就是黄埔精神、現在我們學校成立已有了十載、不必說各期畢業的學生有兩萬多人、就是現在只在校的官長學生的人數、也要比當初多過十倍、一切設備武器等等、也比以前好過十倍、但是在這個本校十週年紀念和第二期國民革命開始的時候、我們目前革命的環境　還是和十年以前在廣東第一期國民革命開始的工作那個時候一樣　以後必有很多帝國主義的兵艦來威脅、甚至比以前還要威脅的更厲害、但是我們想到十年以前本校有五百條步槍、就可以抵抗帝國主義、現在有了千條槍、還怕什麽人、還有那一個帝國主義者不能抵抗、我們全校師生和一般將領、必須有當年黄埔的勇氣、革命的信心、共同生機、致奮鬥、以必死的决心、來同南京城共存亡、來保護我們革命的首都、這樣才可以做總理的信徒、才不愧爲本校的師生、今天本校舉行十週年紀念、我們想到過去十年當中、我們一般死了的師生、他們是如何的勇敢、來爲黨爲國　主義而犠牲、更想到本校師生在過去十年中、掃除全國一切軍閥、完成的第　期國民革命的事業、是何等的光榮、何等的偉大、我們第一期國民革命的工作、　奠定更偉大的第二期國民革命的基礎、我相信本校全體師生、一定能在這個基礎上繼續努力、將過去的功業、一天一天的發掦光大、不過大家要曉得第二期的國民革命、比較第一期國民革命更加艱鉅、所以我們務必比以前更加倍的提起革命精神、努力奮鬥、在今日舉行這個重大的十週紀念典禮時、我們要在總理銅像的面前、在先烈的靈魂感應之下、下定我們的决心、刻苦耐勞　沉毅堅忍、黨存與存、國亡與亡、將我們的身體心血和生命、統統貢獻於黨國、以實現我們的三民主義、創造頂天立地事業、建設一個眞正自由平等的中華民國、這就是本校全體師生的使命、亦就是今天本校舉行十週年紀念的時候、個個同學個個同志所應有的一種革命的决心、</p>

<h3>平瀋通車細則　中日雙方將同時公佈　七月一日正式實行　合組機關主持其事　-黄郛將於月底前北近-</h3>
<p>關於平瀋通車問題、因尙有若干技術上枝節、尙待商洽、故迄未正式實行、連日電訊所傳、日人方面、已有迫不及待之勢、昨據有關係方面傳出消息如次、</p>
<h3>决定細則同時公布</h3>
<p>據某有關係方面之負責　　人聲稱、平瀋通車、刻已　　决定於七月一日正式實行、中日雙方迭經商洽之通車細則、業經雙方同意、亦决於本月二十八日由中日雙方同時公佈、在此時期中、苟無其他枝節發生、當不致有延期等情事、而滯留滬瀆靜待時機成熟之行政院駐平政務整理委員會委員長黄膺白氏、當可於本月底以前返平主持一切、</p>
<h3>合組機關主持其事</h3>
<p>主持平瀋通車之事務者　　、中日兩政府機關、均未　　參預、係由雙方合組一商務機關以經營之、其形式略如通濟隆公司承辦萬國臥車彷彿、聞日本方面已决定委由遼寗觀光局辦理、該局係於九一八戰事之前、向中國政府註册登記、其性質係專辦旅行業務與經售客票等手續、而中國方面則尙無此項負責機關、在政府所屬意中者、厥爲中國旅行社堪勝此任、</p>
<h3>中國旅行社之難題</h3>
<p>中國旅行社是否允負此　　責任、頗爲一般所重視、　　茲據該行負責人稱、鐵道部對於此事、確曾向該社徴求同意、並正式委托該社辦理、但中國旅行社爲一純粹商業性質之機關、雖欲仰體政府苦心、深恐承辦平瀋通車、責任重大、將來中日間或不免發生糾纷、爲避免應付政治上之麻煩起見、祇允予以考慮、並未承受其事、日内擬召集董事會議、聽取公衆之意見後决定、</p>
<h3>借車行駛依法登記</h3>
<p>此次主持通車營業之商　　務機關、其辦法乃係借　　鐵路而行駛車輛、現在距離正式通車之期極近、自辦車輛、當然不及、祇可暫由北寗路或南滿路借車應用、先行開駛、預定在一年以後、再由該機關措資訂購客貨車輛應用、但該機關於辦理正式通車之前、應按照中國法規、先向中國政府主管機關註册登記、而營業上之利益、則祇有佣金五厘、</p>
<h3>永久性質避免僞滿</h3>
<p>又據官塲方面消息、中　　日雙方合組之通車商務　　機關、其名稱現在尙未確定、但其性質則係永久的、將來「滿洲國」由我國或以武力或以政治方法收回失地之時、此項機關、不受任何影響、仍得存在營業、目前通車細則所定之内容、亦絕對避免有「滿洲國」名義之參加、中國方面、刻雖未確定何項機關承辦、然而一般預料、總不外中國旅行社負此責任也云云、</p>

<h3>（一）關於讀書會的話</h3>
<p>靑年會讀書會已於前日（十七）開過成立會了。靑年會讀書會與我們的一段姻緣，似乎從此可以吿一段落了。但我們覺得還有向讀者作一回筆談的必要了。</p>
<p>本刋公佈讀書會的消息是在第五期上，隔現在剛剛有了兩月之久。在這期間中，我們天天都收到讀者諸君的來信，探詢和建議的函件已逾六百多通了。我們非常慚愧，未能一一個别作覆祇在本刋上接連的報吿讀書會的消息，後來因爲報名加入的人數增到二百了，客觀上的因難使我們不能單獨進行，所以纔有與靑年會商議合辦之舉。大家雖然同意了，但在辦事的系統上却不能不出靑年會來負全責，我們祇能在精神上加以帮助。自從靑年會主辦這事後，我們將已在本舘簽名的讀者發出開會的通知，請他們到靑年會去繳會金、領取入會證，同時我們中有幾人榮幸的受了靑年智育部的聘請，作爲讀者會顧問，將來在讀書會中仍有大家見面的機會，這更是非常可慰的。並且，我們還貢獻了許多我們指導讀書的經騐，以供靑年會的參攷。這樣一來，我們對社會服務的實質已經盡了，雖然我們非常的遺憾，我們不能單獨來做這項工作，有許多地方是對不起讀者的，許多讀者來信責備我們，要我們公佈與靑年會合作的原因，實在，我們除在本刋第五期以後各期上公佈的消息以外，並無其他原因可說，現在大會已開過會了，所以我們還需要將以上的經過作一簡明的陳述，藉此結束這一項懸案。</p>
<p>我們萬分愉快參加了前日的成立會。當我們看到參加高級班的同學對於分組的那般認眞熱烈的討論，恐怕是任何大學裏都没有的現象罷！這，無疑地，是非常可喜的現象。讀書會無疑義的是有着非常廣大的前途的。</p>
<p>這項工作，在本部卽作了如是的結束了。以後讀者倘有對於讀書會消息的見詢，也請直寄靑年會，本部不代收一切函件及作覆。但本刋「情報」一欄中，在相當時期預備將靑年會讀書會的消息彙集刋出，以報吿本部外埠關心讀書會的讀者。</p>
<p>（二情報）</p>
<h3>（一）讀者通信用箋不日發售</h3>
<p>信箋用道連紙精　　印，毎張可寫三　　百五十字。四週附姓名，通訊處，第Ｘ次通訊，所提問題性質等，旣合實用，又富美觀。印刷成本費每百張裝成一本，約合大洋二角。不日在本舘詢問處發售。我們决定於八月一日起全體改用此項信箋，希望讀者能早日卽照本部决定實行。</p>
<h3>（二）不收著作</h3>
<p>我們常常收到讀者寄來許多大　　著要求介紹出版，因爲我們自　　已尙未有出版計晝，亦無自已的出版部，實不能收稿，至於介紹書店，不獨我們無此多餘時間向書店交涉，卽各書店此時亦多不收稿，實在愛莫能助。因恐往返郵寄遺失，本部要求讀者以後請勿再寄來部，卽寄</p>
<p>來本部亦决定隨郵奉還，恕不拆閱也，千乞原諒！</p>
<p>書報推薦</p>
<h3>文心</h3>
<p>夏丐尊葉聖陶合著　　　　　定價大洋七角　　　　　開明書店出版　　文心是一部用故事的體裁來寫關於國文的全體知識的書。就體例說，這是空前未有的著作，夏葉兩先生眞不愧是中國的伊林先生。這</p>
<p>在把艱解的知識通俗化的一意義說，這部書的出版是值得特别注意的。　　全書計三十二篇，每一篇討論一個國文上的主題。因爲作者能將抽象的知識鎔化到具體的事實中去，所以雖然是論「文」之作，讀起來並不感到艱澀。理論並不妨害故事的發展，我們祇會覺的越讀越覺的新鮮，生動，引人入勝。</p>
<p>我們在推薦此書之後，我們更感覺到中国目下更需要的是有人能將社會科學，自然科學的知識寫成「文心」似的故事，使大衆易於攝取這些平日素來不敢問津的知識。我們自己現在也正朝着這方向努力。</p>
<p>我們大家正需要伊林先生！</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我不禁又聯想到一件關於服裝的故事。這件　　故事至今還是很鮮明地印在我的腦神筋上，像昨天所發生的事情一樣。那是太后的誕辰的隔夜，因爲明天少不得將有一番上壽的大典，所以我們大家就一齊忙着，要凖備衣服。可是我却偏不凑巧，没有適當的衣服；或者可以說是有的，而且它的式樣，顏色，都很精美，爲我自己所十二分滿意的，無奈这一件衣服上有貂皮的出锋裝着，而那個時候還没有到規定穿貂皮的時期咧！要是我公然穿了這一襲貂皮出锋的衣服，前去給太后磕頭上壽的話，那就難逃一個抗旨和越禮的罪名了。不過平心論來，那時候已將交十二月，天氣委實是很冷了，所爲難的就是太后的詔書還不曾頒下去，誰也不敢把貂皮穿出來；不但不敢穿，便是有膽量向太后建議，催促伊早些頒布那換穿貂皮的詔書的人，也從來不曾有過。但是這一次，我竟極勇敢地向伊建議了。眞可說是冒了一次絕大的危險！可是那也只能說機會凑巧，並不全賴我的膽量。其時，我照例又是站在太后的背後，因爲伊不時要命令我給伊辦些雜務，所以我總是站得很貼近伊的。一陣微風飄過，伊似乎有些發抖，一面就喃喃地說道：「這天氣眞是太冷了！」</p>
<p>伊這句話一說，我立刻便認爲是絕好的機會來了。我的膽子也突然放大了，這不是我自己誇大，讀者要知道在皇太后跟前本不是隨便可以說話的，說得不好，往往會立刻得到一個罪名。（六一）</p>
<h3>草場上</h3>
<p>— 馬嬰</p>
<p>黄昏時候，草塲上聚集了一堆人；</p>
<p>老的，少的，村的，俏的。前三層的人都掇條長凳坐着，後面没有凳子的，便都站成一個圓圏，可是大家都不動，瞪起了眼睛張着耳朶，像是用木頭刻成的人像。</p>
<p>但如果你有力量衝進重圍，你便可以看見一張桌子，一把戒刀，和一面小鑼，桌旁站着一個紫銅色面孔穿着舊長衫的先生，也許他手裏還有一把扇子。他的確是一個萬能的人物，有時要笑，有是要哭，有時要做英雄，有時要做美人，就是這些英雄，美人，痛哭，獃笑，把四圍人們的靈魂攝了去了。</p>
<p>「嚇！你看那趙子龍的一枝槍，左挑右撥，盤根蓋頂，······」先生口裏嚷着，腿子早已擺好姿勢，睜眉怒目，把手裏的扇子在空中舞動着，好像他就是趙子龍，而那摺扇就是爛銀槍。</p>
<p>聽的人都欣然，却又有些心慌，怕那枝爛銀槍直捲過來，那准得搠幾個透明窟窿。</p>
<p>可是趙子龍却已殺到古井旁，遇着糜夫人了，於是那先生在千慌萬忙中，頓减英雄氣概，娉娉婷婷，鶯聲燕語，顯然他已經變換了個女身，在没有一秒鐘的很快的時間裏，</p>
<p>聽的人更欣然了，却都張大了口，睜開了眼，似乎都想衝進去抱着糜夫人親一個嘴。</p>
<p>就在這樣忽男忽女忽笑忽哭的忙動中，那先生得了相當的代價，而四圍的人們也得了相當的安慰，都心滿意足的走了。剩下寂寞的草塲在暮色裏。</p>
<h3>傷風</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>初夏的季節，氣候是最會變化，一忽兒很熱，一忽兒又轉冷了。倘使我們不時時刻刻留心自己的衣着，是很容易傷風的，傷風的現象，就是；鼻塞，頭痛，或咳嗽，感到極度的身體不適，假使我們每天服幾片阿四匹林，在三四天骨就會好的。</p>
<p>可是中國人最迷信，自己患了傷風，就拿一張紅纸寫些在上面，隨便貼在人家的白壁上，它的詞句是：「出賣重傷風，一見就成功。」據一般有經騐的人傳說，這兩句詞貼在人家墙上或電桿木上，不出三日这内，自己的傷風就會好的。</p>
<p>在這上面看來，顯見中国人是没有道德，自己生了傷風病，却想傳染給人家，現在提倡新生活運動的當兒，正在努力提倡舊道德，我希望中國的民衆，再不要玩這種迷信的舉動，免給外人看了好笑。流行的傷風是很容易傳染的，被傳染者並不是看了「出賣重傷風，一見就成功」的。</p>
<p>最近我們家内的兩個小女都患了傷風病，全家二十幾個人差不多個個都流行過了，難道我們都是向人家買來的嗎？</p>
<p>可見這種迷信是不打自破的啊。</p>

<p>彈穿勁臂灑血染孤城</p>
<p>現在休息以後。身上出的汗冷了下來。臉上也就慢慢的　　覺着有些割人，在空塲裏的風向人身上擈來，不由得人簌簌的抖颤着。抬頭看着天空，太陽光變淺紅色。雲彩捲着濃厚的團團成爲雞子黄色，讓地面上的積雪，向上反映着，更覺得這宇宙之間，都帶着一種死色。因之天空裏，不見一點靑綠的影子，更也不見一隻飛鳥，由天空裏飛過，慢慢的在灰色的天空裏，露出一兩個星點，該是天色垂黒了，心裏說不出來，有一種什麽感觸，只覺有一件事情、不曾辦了，要跟着辦下去才對。但是自已又明知道並不是如此，這是心理作用，把自已閙糊涂了。於是安心回連部去辦理公事，趁着勞碌，把心理的煩悶掃除了，累了一天，到了晚上九點鐘，吹了安息的號，自已先倒在坑上睡下，泰然的失去了一切知覺。可是正在睡夢中感到舒適的時候，鳴打打的凖備號令。送入了耳鼓。在這種環境之下，當連長的人，可以說是脚底下有個螞蟻走着，都可以聽得出嚮聲來的。這樣緊急的號聲，趙自强那裏有不感覺到的。因之他首先一骨碌起來，搶火似的，將衣服穿整齊了，立刻跑到弟兄住的屋子裏去，看他們起來了没有。聽得弟兄們在黑暗裏嚮亂着，又跑回房去，繫上了子彈帶，背上了手槍，這其間統共不能超過十分鐘，傳令兵就跑了來對自强道，營長請連長就去。自强剛只答應了一句話，傳令兵轉身已走，似乎又已傳令給别個連長去了。（四一二）</p>

<p>幾部汽車，像紅葉飄在河流般打從西蒲石路上滑過。一直開進了明星影片公司。</p>
<p>停下來，一叢人往會客室裏闖　擁。正秋劍雲等春風滿面地殷勤接待着，接待這位將要返藏主持政務的班禪大師。　大師穿黄色長袍，軒昂地頻頻微頷其首，在與大家表示酹應。</p>

<p>越日，大師又來到明星攝影塲，專誠看拍戲，作陪者有李大超王孝英等。</p>
<p>這天晚上拍的是李萍倩導演的「三姊妹」。</p>
<p>「這部戲是由日本文藝家菊池寛氏名著「新珠」改编的。故事述說三個姊妹，在伊們父親１１１畫師１１死後所遭受到的壓迫的悲哀，有的是機警者，有的是動搖者，有的是没落者，其描畫戴着桂冠紳士們之玩弄女性處，如追求，熱愛，厭視，遺棄種種，都有細膩描寫，其於男性底中心社會的醜惡面也有更深刻的諷刺與抨擊。」譯者講給班禪大師聽。</p>
<p>「據說：這部戲已排定廢曆端午節在新光上演了。」</p>
<p>「噢，噢。」</p>
<p>夜風吹殘了月色，他們一夥纔又懷着倦意踏着銀光載車歸去。</p>

<p>拉雑話</p>
<h3>我談狗（上）</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我生平最愛養狗，　　所以對於狗的生活狀態，稍有經騐，現在我把蓄養的心得，來介紹一下。</p>
<p>（一）買小狗時的注意，普通生後過了二個月爲離乳期，這時母乳中的滋養分加爾秀姆（Ｃalcium）已不足補給小狗的營養了，應當另喂他種食物，助長其發育，每年到了四五月，出賚小狗最多，但夏產的狗，容易脫毛，所以養狗以冬產者爲宜。我在北平時，每逢廟會，必跑到土地廟，龍福寺，白塔寺去看狗市，當時蓄養了大小八隻哈白狗，都是很伶俐的，民国十六年南歸時爲友人索去四隻，帶了四隻回來，其中兩隻，已完全悟解人言，隨時可代傭人搬取物件，後來割愛送給王曉籟先生了。與余有同癖的周亞衛君，跑到他的庽所，差不多爲狗羣佔滿房間，每日除了辦公時間外·幾乎終日與狗遊玩。說到買狗時最要注意的，第一要鑑定它是否健康，就是（一）看狗的身體發逹肥滿結實，行動活潑，，（二）眼睛明朗。（三）鼻尖潮濕，（四）毛色光潤，（五）大便稍硬，具備五種條件，可斷定爲健康的。我国的俗語，說短嘴善吠者，稱守門狗，體肥不吠者，曰食狗，倘若背脊彎曲</p>
<p>，眼脂流出，眼球不潔，鼻尖乾燥，鼻涕常流，便糞稀薄，步行不如意，齒齦呈蒼白色，那是有病的徴象。其次爲年齡的鑑定，選買小狗，應當知道其年齡，如乳齒已生者，是二個月，門齒（在前面二齒）已換永久齒者，（白而大的齒）已有四個月，中齒（門齒旁的齒）已換者約有五個月，隅齒（中齒旁的齒）已換者，約有五六個月，永久齒已完全者爲六個月。最後要分辦狥的善意，這是很難的事，没有養過狗的人，當然不懂的，普通多以自己所愛的形體選購，可是形體的最要者，（一）要身體混圓而長，頸部不可太長，（三）頭面要短阔（臘犬，與西巴</p>
<p>特種例外）（四）四肢肥硬，（五）眼白紅經密布，（六）聞聲兩耳直聳發勁，（七）驟見生人，目光炯炯注視，如具備上述七種要件，那可算良種了（二）狗屋的造法，狗的住屋，須放在乾燥面太陽的地方，就是要冬暖夏凉，切不可放在出入煩雜之處。狗屋以木造爲最宜，中間塡以稻草麻袋，（夏則換蓆）出入口釘以交錯的板，便於冬季防寒，屋離地面，須有一尺高，狗屋應常整理消毒，普通狗病最多的，爲希拉里耶病，這病都是蚊子傳染的，所以狗屋的出入口，須用鐵絲綱，門的啓閉，用雙面活動彈簧，床板用臭藥水洗滌，那末，可防害蟲發生的。（三）喂食的注意，離乳的小狗，先喂以稀薄的粥，粥内拌些猪肝牛肉漸漸混入其他食物，食量不宜過多，以有八分飽爲宜。但是食物尙熱，或有辛辣甘甜的物，切不可喂，且須常給淸潔温水，夏季尤不可忘，鹹菜能助消化，每次拌進少許，小的肉骨頭，最喜歡吃，骨頭内含有燐酸加爾秀姆，應常喂飼。</p>

<h3>主席報吿</h3>
<p>主席鈕長耀報吿略謂、六區　　社敎同志、過去雖同在辦理社敎事業、但因時間的牽制、區域的隔閡、不能時常聚首、相互研討最近敎廳訂定省立社敎機關輔導各縣社會敎育辦法、把蘇省劃成六區　每區指定省立民敎舘擔任指導事宜、並規定分區社敎研究會議辦法、以謀發展社敎、本區包括舊松屬七縣及嘉寳太三縣合共十縣、各縣臨近海濱、當此太平洋風雲日益險惡的今日、我們不能</p>
<p>再唱高調、應從速計劃、共謀促進社會、以復興民族、本屆大會以生計敎育爲討論的中心、同時又舉行十縣生計敎育聯合成續展覽會、我們希望乘這個機會、集思廣益、捨短取長、討論出確切有效的辦法、去解紓國家當前的危機、增加民衆生產的力量云、</p>
<h3>代表致詞</h3>
<p>省敎廳代表吳剑眞致詞略謂　　、社敎發展可分三個時期、（一）試辦時期、（二）推行時期、（三）普及時期、日前蘇省社敎情形、正是停頓於高原的時期、是第二時期過渡到第三時期之關鍵、希各位努力、超過此難關、以期逹到普及、欲改進社敎必需、（一）組織健全、（二）工作確實（三）經費節省、（四）政敎合一、（五）以社會爲本位云、省黨部代表邱有珍致詞略謂　關於政敎合一、兄弟略有感想、依過去歷史來看、從前政治長官負責較少、地方事業之進步、並不依靠政治、是由地方人士如族長、士紳等負責改進、現在封建制度之崩潰、地方領袖之動搖、此等人已失其地位、故地方事業之改進亦失掉中心、許多事業遂由地方機關去辦、但政治之設施、完全本其政治基礎建築而來、我們欲謀地方政治之改進、從事社敎者、應設法把政治基礎轉移到人民身上、而使政府一切措施、均應民衆的需要、地方事業才有進步云、</p>

<h3>第十三屆衛生運動特刋緒言編者胡昌治</h3>
<p>特刋者何？得通儒碩望之言，以障挽傾頽也。淫辭邪僻之不放正也久，將有作於上者，抑詭怪而暢皇極，語默之間，興廢所由也，可不愼乎！衛生運動，論者衆，或失浮薄，或甚剔抉，枝辭琢正，纷紊糾射，而悱然非矣，藐然聽矣。大雅宏逹，於茲爲羣，爲緒言以序端。</p>
<h3>爲十三屆衛生運動吿全市民衆</h3>
<p>— 李廷安</p>
<p>公共衛生，簡言之，欲人之無病而已矣。然進言之，於個人則非獨祛除疾病，克享大年。而優哉遊哉，人生之興趣盎然，魁乎雄乎，工作之効能增矣。於國家則死亡率旣經下降，經濟上無謂之損失，因以得免，而工作効力旣已遞增，生產上經常之民獲，必以倍豐，此公共衛生所以爲近代國家要政之一也。迺者，蔣委員長倡新生活於南昌，以正心誠意，將大有爲於國家民族，而獨舉衛生淸潔，爲入德之門，是豈窮居獨善　　[Ｉ&gt;</p>
<h3>吳鐵城市長近影</h3>

<p>，抑深有憂懐在耶。於是邑之人多有以擴大衛生運動，必須及時舉行言者。爰由市衛生局召集市府以下二十六機關團體，組織十三屆衛生運動籌備會，孹劃經營，月餘而底成，濟濟蹌蹌，讜言宏說，元元本本，殫見洽聞，而二租界衛生工務警務三處，亦竭誠合作，共相匡襄。廷安有愧而　，且喜中外之同域也，，抑有言者，本屆衛生運動，爲使政府集中力量，民衆集中注意，宣傳中心，厥定爲五：一曰吐痰必須養成良好習慣。二曰小便必上厠所。三曰垃圾必傾倒入垃圾桶内。；四曰飮水必飮沸水。五曰[Ｉ&gt;</p>

<p>接受防疫注射。雖曰小善，能行是，是</p>
<p>亦足矣。事有終始，先後不可以不知也。非徒此也，民衆漠然於衛生淸潔久矣，蓋衛生觀念蕩然耳，雖然，欲觀念之，確立，又非直接灌輸所能收効，必先之以日常生活之改變，具體行爲之指導，上述五項中心，實爲銷鑰。他日觀念旣固，自是以發，舉凡政府所欲民衆厲行之衛生習慣，將如水之流下，不待濬注而自一日千里矣！國家經濟之復興，民族精神之奮發，可期而待。生活之新，其在斯乎？其在斯乎？</p>

<h3>上海市第十三屆衛生　運動大會宣言</h3>
<p>一，衛生運動之意義</p>
<p>衛生運動普行國内已久，乃其意義所在，尙尠知者。雖曰理論之齗齗，無關實際，而民衆之蚩蚩，厥賴啓示。夫衛生運動，自表面觀之，誠屬一時之興奮，而其微旨所歸，乃在乎綿延亘續，歷時日而不衰。不過開其端，利其勢，不能不有此一時之興奮，以引導之耳，譬之機器，方其靜止也，累重拙劣，欲其一輪一齒之轉動，幾不可得，乃夫開機者，加手於機關之上，一撥之勞，如河之决，如山之崩，其勢不可復遏，無復須假手於人矣，然則運行不輟，盤轉如飛，固賴機器本身之機能，而一指旣撥，萬輪以動，寗可自表面觀之，謂爲僅屬一時之鼔動而已哉！是故公共衛生雖未能自劃於一時之衛生運動，而衛生運動實爲一切公共衛生事業之發軔，二者有相生相承之用，不可偏廢，胡爲而輕視衛生運動若贅　。</p>
<p>二，本屆衛生運動之使命</p>
<p>雖然，衛生運動非可期以奢望者也。必實事求是，由近及遠，自小至大，不患無成功之一日。是故衛生運動雖每年僅舉行一次，而其逐步計劃，終不失其一貫之精神。上海市之有衛生運動，歷十二屆於茲，同人等捫心自問，不禁有昨非之　。迺者蔣委員長倡新生活運動於南昌，兢兢以鶩高遠蹈，空虚爲戒，風尙所移，頑廉懦立，同人等計過不安，爲是惶悚，僉以本屆衛生運動，誠宜力求實際，重立基礎，小心翼翼，敢以一言一行爲復興民族之根本，舉凡本屆衛生運動舉辦事項，不事舗張，不尙俗好，一以久遠切實爲歸，蓋公共衛生而欲有澈底厲行之一日，固不宜徒務高遠，而民族復興，任重道遠，亦願以今日之進尺，樹基於萬年也！</p>
<p>三，本屆衛生運動之中心</p>
<p>衛生運動自有連續之步驟，有如前述，本屆衛生運動亦應標樹其獨具之中心五：曰吐痰須吐安全地，小便必上厠所，接受防疫注射，垃圾須倒垃圾桶内，喝水必喝沸水，良以惡小如隨地吐痰小便，傾倒垃圾等，不知糾正，亦足釀</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>火禍。而善小如上述五項之厲行，澈底爲之，影響國家民族之前途，寗屬淺鮮？蓋生活之新，於是乎始，而運動之義，於是乎得，以是爲中心，庶幾近務本　。</p>
<p>四，本屆衛生運動之期望</p>
<p>國家之興，其來有自，禛祥之兆，常在民衆。任何運動，誠具其個别之功用，而民族發展，乃有其唯一之目標。同人等舉辦衛生運動，在此運動期間，固有待民衆之竭誠合作，而馨香祈禱，深望吾民衆共同努力於運動後者，蓋無窮焉。用是宣言，永昭大義。</p>
<h3>上海市第十三屆衛生運動大會敬吿民衆書</h3>
<p>親愛的同胞們：事急了！我國民族體質之不振，世無倫比，原因雖然很複雜，但癆病的侵害，實爲其中原因最大之一。所以關於癆病問題，不能不向同胞們略吿一吓。我國向爲衛生智識落後</p>
<p>的國家，成年男女，百分的九十八，已受着癆菌的威脅，那些生機堅强的或者能够抵抗，但可惜一般脆弱的民族，體力旣然孱弱，生機亦極平庸，因此一經癆菌的侵襲便束手就擒了。國家這樣，我們還堪設想嗎？所以當前的局面，實在是我們民族生死的一個重要關頭，不可以等閒視的。根據最近的统計，世界癆病的死率，以十萬人爲單位：牛西蘭死五十一人，埃及死七十二人，美國死七十九人，德國死八十六人，英國死一百零二人，西班牙死一百三十六人，義國死一百四十八人，法國死一百七十五人，日本死一百八十六人，但是我國的癆病死率，竟逹到四百人。由此看來，我國的癆病死率，八倍於牛西蘭，六倍於埃及及美國五倍於德國·四倍於英國，三倍於西班牙，二倍於義國法國及日本。更使我們可怕的，假如患是病的，每十人中死去一人，十萬人中，便應有患癆病的四千人，中國人口以四萬萬計，應有一千六百萬人，換句话說，中國毎二十五人，必有患癆病一人，我國全年所死的癆病人數，不下一百六十萬人，一年三百六十五日，一日二十四小時，一小時六十分，全年共有五十二萬五千六百分鐘，每分鐘死三人，每十分鐘卽爲三十人：還有，我國現有一千六百萬患癆病的專家，每人平均負傳播癆菌與十人之責。那麽，一年之間，我國不</p>
<p>難產生一萬萬六千萬的病夫。一年一年的遞增，我們整個民族，在最短期間内，不難全體陷於不可救治之慘狀了，然則吾國的癆病狀况，已日趨嚴重，實遠超過日奴飛機的轟炸，海軍的封鎖，如果不及早預防，對於已患的實行，補救之治療，對於未患的，實施防癆之敎育，則東亞病夫之譏，不但不能洗雪於萬一，卽民族一綫的生機，亦爲之斬斷無餘了。我們目睹斯狀，所以聯合各界同志，組織防癆恊會，凖備和那摧殘民族的大敵抗。我們很希望，同胞們能够知所預防，預防的方法如下：（一）養成有規則的良好衛生習惯，可以抵抗癆菌。（衣食住行睡工皆有規則及合乎衛生是）。（二）隨各人之需要，參加合乎中庸的體力運動。（三）多見陽光，與呼吸新鮮空氣。（四）病人之隔離，不使傳播癆菌。（五）檢查身體。（六）已病者施以適當之療養。誠能如此，則癆菌無由侵入，疾病不會叢生，民族便也康健，國家也就漸漸强盛了。</p>
<p>淸潔衛生是健康之始基有健康的國民民族纔可以復興</p>

<h3>關於大語衆文學的建設</h3>
<p>— 陳望道</p>
<p>在中國文學史上，筆頭用語本來很複雜，简單分起來，大約可以分成下面這樣一個表所列：</p>
<p>貴族語（文言）</p>
<p>筆頭語　市民語（白話）　敎士語（語錄體）　　　　　　　　　　　大衆語（在宋代如「评話」上用語）</p>
<p>五四前後「文學革命」時代關於筆頭語的論戰，便是市民語和貴族語的論戰。當時對文言爭市民權的筆頭語，是包括着敎士語和大衆語兩種語。而且往往把兩種語平等的看待，留一個退入語錄語的可能。這是當時的短處。但當時所以把敎士語和大衆語同等看待，不過是當時急於和文言對立的情勢逼他顯出了那樣看相，骨子裏到底並不是把語錄體做範本的。這比起以前的一切等等始終不脫把語錄體做中心的理論或者實際來，又不能不說是當時的長處。現在陳子展先生，提出大衆語來，可說是吸收了當時的長處，又抛棄了當時的短處。我想大家不會不贊成的。</p>
<p>不過關於大衆語的性質方面，恐怕還有商量研究的餘地。子展先生只提出說，聽，看三樣來做標凖，我想是不够的，寫也一定要顧到。寫的簡便化，這幾年來已經有好多人研究，也是一種進步的現象，將來研究文學的人似乎也不能不注意研究。將來大衆語的語彙裏頭一定不免有外路語輸入，但必須用本國文字寫它的音，讓大家說得出。照過去的經騐看來，輸入些外路語或起用些古典語，在大衆也並不覺得十分不便，只要確實是當時大衆所必需的。如摩登，摩托，冰淇林，手續，引渡之類。這類語彙實際時時在變換，變換起來實際也没有變換語法那樣的煩難。不過總要不違背大衆說得出，聽得懂，寫得順手，看得</p>
<p>明白的條件，才能說是大衆語。</p>
<p>大衆語的修練，只能靠平時，不能靠臨時。一切的規律一切的强制，在臨時纏住心頭，都會妨害了筆頭的自由抒寫。在寫成的文字上顯出了不自然的痕跡。在小說詩歌戲曲之類描寫具體形象的文字上更其如此。所以這里，便要發生了要建設大衆語文文學，必須實際接近大衆，向大衆去學語言的問題。單單躱在書房裏頭不同大衆接近，或同大衆接近不去注意他們語言，都難以成就大衆語文學作家。</p>
<p>大衆的語言確實是値得學習的。尤其是文法。它有好些地方都已經變得比文言更整齊，更巧妙，更自然。比如桐城派的人極賣力地說過的，所謂實字虚用虚字實用，在文言中如「雨欲吳王我乎」「春風風人」，都不過用字來硬用，文法上並没有一定的方法可以帮凑，所以讀起來也覺得很不自然，說起來更不必說，在大衆的口頭語上，却有一定說法。要把虚字實用，便可以加「頭」之類實字的接尾。如「想」字要實用，就可說「想頭」之類。要把實字虚用，也同樣地有方法。可以添加「了」「着」「起」「下」「去」「來」等等字。如「車」「袋」等字要虚用，便可以說「車了去」</p>
<p>「袋了去」之類。這等語言的進步性質，固然極應該學。不過文學並非單有語言就行的。一切的文學都需要會得看現實，看現實又需要有一定的態度。態度的修養，實際又比語言的修養更重要。有些語言上的問題，也需要從態度上去選擇去决定。</p>
<p>要建設大衆語文學問題很多，需要大家，來細心地討論。</p>
<h3>各盡所能</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>生在現在的中國，眞是幸運得很，是有好多的事，待我們去作。作創作也好，作批評也好，作繙譯也好，作研究也好。如果能各盡所能去作事，是有好些事可以作的。</p>
<p>Ｋnow　Tbyself，我覺得這是一句立身的金言。也是許年齡的關係罷，我現在覺得「各盡所能」這四個字是很能帮助我們的工作效率的。</p>
<p>靑年的時候，有時喜歡唱高調，是非常浪漫諦克的。好高務遠，結果，一無所成。空想是没有收穫的。與其那樣，到不如縮小範圍，認眞地作點小事。</p>
<p>我不是說文人不應當有奔放的憧憬，憧憬是需要的。我不是說文人不應當有强大的野心，野心是一種推動力。不過不能實現的憧憬與野心，是有碍工作的。我以爲，與其那樣，不如度德量力，各盡所能，反倒好得多。</p>
<p>Ｋnow　Tbyselt自知，是必要的。有的人無妨從象牙之塔到十字街頭，而有的人在大科學的研究室去作工作也是必要的。到羅馬的大道，不只一條。研究古代和研究現代，都可逹到同樣的結論。能在哪個分野成功，無妨就在哪個分野中盡力之所能。</p>
<p>以先對於一些國文學的註册式的研究者我表示着不滿。總以爲那種掛帳式的研究，羅列式的考據，是不成爲歷史的研究的。現在，覺到那種想法，是不對的。那些羅列式的考據，雖不成爲歷史，至少得成爲史料。如果他們的考據是精確的話，那麽，他們也算盡了很大的任務了。</p>
<p>俗語說得好：「一鍫挖不得一個井。」如果有人想編制一本好的文學史的話，是須有豐富的正確的材料作爲根據。如果有人不會蓋房子而能打得很好的地基的話，他的功勞也不算小。只要他對於工作忠實，那麽，我們對於他是要致敬意的。</p>
<p>我說：人要各盡所能。如果有能而不盡，是罪該萬死。譬如說，有人英文很好，不譯英美文學，而去投機取巧地去間接譯法國的文學，這是不好的。因爲間接繙繹，是一種滑頭辦法。如果不得已時，是可以許可的。但是，避難就易，是不可以的。如果有人有批評的才能，而因爲繙繹省力，不去作批評而作繙繹，這也是不可以的。各盡所能，主要的點，是在於一個「盡」字。</p>
<p>對於一件事情没有深切的了解，總覺得那件事容易作。有人說西洋文學研究起來比中國文學容易。其實不然。他大概還是没了解到其麻煩。比方說，懂英文的，不去介紹Ｄospassos而去介紹ＡndreGido就是此種之一例。這一類的例子，不是表明介紹者理解不深，就是表明他有點要唱高調。我以爲介紹一作家時，至少須讀過他的幾本代表作。不然，弄錯了自己都會不曉得。這種不切實的介紹者雖比只談原則公式，不管事實的人好些，但是同爲淸談主義者，能說他們各盡所能麽？他們不是没有才能，他們爲什麽不發揚自己的所長呢？</p>
<p>Ｋnow　Thyself！各盡所能！在現在中國，是需要切實地作一點事情的。作點傻事罷！淸談是足以誤國的。</p>
<h3>五明與三明</h3>
<p>— 穆</p>
<p>班禪額爾德尼，近日在某處演說，敷衍五明論，語焉不詳，一因譯者失眞，二因記者闇昧，反將明顯之義理，又要弄成「不可思議」了，因作此文，以袪衆惑。</p>
<p>大唐西域記乃玄奘法師所著，玄奘卽俗稱之唐僧。唐僧往「西天」！！卽印度！！「取經」，從戒賢法師學得大乘瑜伽論。其實那時求法，無異於今之出國留學。求學在於問道，問道在於參師，古希臘有在外留學著名的梭龍，至今歐西還有遊學的風氣，古日本也多入唐求學的名僧，也不過來求學而已。</p>
<p>可貴的是這許多求法之士，也從外國給紹介了各種風土民情。如大唐西域記中，記載印度敎育，有這麽一段文字；</p>
<p>「七歲之後，漸授五明大　　論：</p>
<p>一曰聲明：釋詁訓字，　　詮目流别。</p>
<p>二日巧明：技術機關，　　陰陽曆數。</p>
<p>三曰醫方明：禁咒閑　　　，藥石針艾。</p>
<p>四曰因明：考定正　，　　研　眞僞。</p>
<p>五曰内明：究暢五乘，　　因果妙理。：：：</p>
<p>師必博究精微，貫窮玄　　奥，示之大義，導以微言　　，提撕善誘，彫朽勵薄。</p>
<p>若乃識最通敏，志懹逋　　逸，則拘緊及關，業成後　　已，年方三十，志立學成　　。！！</p>
<p>旣居祿位，先酬師德。　　　其有博古好雅，肥遁居　　貞，沈浮物外，逍遙裠表　　，寵辱不驚，聲聞已遠。　　君王雅尙，莫能屈迹。</p>
<p>然而國重聰數，俗貴高　　明，褒贊旣隆，禮命亦　　　，故能强志篤學，忘疲遊　　藝，訪道依仁，不遠千里　　，家雖豪富，志均　旅，　　口腹之資，巡匈以濟，有　　貴知道，無恥匱財。」···　這麽看來，五明者，今之大學之五科而已。聲音明是文科，包括文字學，聲韵學，文學之類，但一經現代報纸登出，就非「通鳥語，知吉凶」不可了。班禪大師，未必作如是言說。漢人有意弄成神秘，惑亂愚民的。</p>
<p>挍巧明無非工科也包括天文學，醫方明無非醫科，因明是哲學，内明是宗敎學。因爲古代印度還有些像中國舊社會，敎育是私塾制，重專授，重私傳，重遊學，較之西方近代學制，終嫌不開化，然神秘的意味是没有的。</p>
<p>普通人稱「佛法無邊」，通常只指印度文化的廣大深微而已。五明是印度文化，是佛法的所由來，但班禪演講一次，好奇者如雲而起，以爲又是「不可思議」了。（「不可思議」，與「不可名言」「不可書喩」，及「不能思議」不同，嚴幾道解釋的最淸楚，見天演論論佛敎。）其錯誤，是將五明和三明混爲一談。</p>
<p>「　侈遮羅那三般那」１１秦言明行足。大論云：宿命，天眼，漏盡，名爲三明：：：智論問：神通與明，有何等異？答：直知過去宿命事，名通：知過去因緣行業，名明。直知死此生彼，名通：知行因緣際會不失，名明。直盡結使，不知更生不生，名通：若知漏盡更不復生，名明。（以上見翻譯名義集。）</p>
<p>據說佛悉具足三明，那麽也是天地間一　笑談吧，亦「不可思議」已。</p>
<h3>關於木刻</h3>
<p>— 猛克</p>
<p>現在，學美術的新靑年，大抵在要求着國際新　作品的介紹吧，看現在出版界的情形，關於國際的名家集子，出來的也不能說不多，但是，那比較前進，切實，可供學徒們參考，取法的東西，却到底還是少的。本來呢，介紹美術品也不是一件容易事，就是繪畫，倘不能將原作搬來，單靠幾張縮小的照像，是要失眞，讀者仍然得不到益處的。旅隼先生在「論翻印木刻」一文裏，說：「假使將象縮小如猪，老虎縮小如鼠」，就不「會令人覺得原先那種氣魄」，這話極中肯。</p>
<p>美術上算作小品的，除漫畫外，就是木刻。有一個時期，木刻彷彿不大爲人注意；一但現在在國際藝壇上，又幾乎佔着重要的位置了，晝籍的插圖，又多用起木刻來。木刻的長處，是用刀刻鑿，較用筆掃刷的表現力更强，而雖是黑白的兩色，却比複雜的彩畫明快，給人的印象，也特别深些。現在中國的書籍和刋物，爲加濃讀者的興趣，也正在需要這種木刻的插圖，且感到這種人材的缺乏。倘想給美術界的靑年一點切實的參考品，又要少失去點原作的眞面目，暫時是最好翻印木刻。近年來，倒也有人在做這件事了，這是極可喜的，但是，我們要慚愧：至今這工作的担任者，還是文學界的一兩位熱心的前輩。</p>
<p>現在介紹進來了的木刻，除了散見在各刋物上的，還有良友出版的麥綏來勒的連環木刻集四種，由私人用玻璃版印的士敏土之圖」一種。在初學者，總算已有了初步的借鏡了。自然，這些還是熱心者零星收集起來的東西，倘要由此知道一國木刻的趨勢和傾向，那是很不够。</p>
<p>日昨，我無意中看到了一本剛出版的「引玉集」，這却是本非常完備的現代俄國木刻集。集中包含密德羅辛等十三個作家的作品。前面冠有陳節先生節譯的楷戈逹耶夫的「十五年來的書籍版畫和單行版畫」一文。在「後記」裏，並有密德羅辛等五個作家親爲這集子作的自傳。將書前的「代序」和各家的作品依次對閱，我們就可以知道，俄國近五十來自「藝術世界」至現實主義的轉變的過程；新舊各派不同的特點，也可由此找出，例如：帶着裝飾氣味的「鐵流」與粗豪堅實的「母親」兩種插圖的作風，就很顯明的表逹出新舊之間的懸隔。再看自傳，則我們於研究作品之餘，又可知道一點各作家的身世，這是極有意思的。我想，這樣有系统的木刻集，對於初學者，一定有更大的帮助吧。</p>
<h3>桂英爸（四）</h3>
<p>— 嘩子</p>
<p>桂英爸望着她的後影，並不激昂地說：　「我要殺你，你這老婆子，走路也不成個樣子，這麽一拐一瘸地。」　說着，他模仿那一拐一瘸的樣子，看的人大笑了。　「哼，要不是看小玉的面上，我早已把她殺了。」桂英爸接着說：「小玉活着的時候，常常對我說：爸爸，看媽病得太可憐，你要原諒她，多讓她些，不要同她閙。我依着小玉的話，所以老是讓她。：：：小玉：：：小玉：；：。」</p>
<p>突然，他頽唐起來，垂了眼，慢慢地拿起第二碗酒，只呷子一小口，隨卽放下，兩手托在櫃台上，有一分鐘不抬頭，似乎要睡去的樣子。　看的人並不因此走散。　桂英爸慢慢地抬起頭來，又呷一口酒，忽然把濕潤的眼光釘住我。　「哦，徐先生嗎，請了請了！哈哈！老三好福氣，你看徐先生多麽温文，老實。」　我的妻排行第三，所以桂英爸呌她老三。　「啊，我的小玉眞可憐呀！」他忽又轉到小玉去了。「徐先生，小玉就是樂建英，就是桂英的哥哥，他是像你這般温文的一個孩子，他是一個革命黨，革命黨是好人，是好人呀！」　他把「是好人」這三個字說得很用力，似乎非使人相信不可。</p>
<p>「不過，說革命黨是好人，我先前是不相信的，自從小玉做了革命黨之後，我方纔相信了。徐先生，你看我這個老頭兒，我曾當過多年的兵，什麽地方都去過，杭州，蘇州，湖南，湖北，福建，廣東，你們紹興我也到過。各地的閒話我都聽得懂，說得來，你們紹興人駡人的話我也駡得來：「那１媽１石１比１農１格１逃１生１子」。不是這樣的麽，杭州呌什麽東西都有個兒字，頭兒，腦兒，盆兒，碗兒，划子嫟，到旗下耍子兒。１不是這樣的麽？這些話，徐先生是懂的，他們未見世面鄉下人，都不會懂的。他們只知道說「格姆」「格樣」，外邊人不呌「格姆」，是呌「什麽」的。徐先生，對不對？」</p>
<p>他說「他們」的時候，手指着店外的觀衆。我以爲他要專講語言學了，但是並不然。　「我在杭州的時候，」他說：「正閙着革命黨那時候，我只知道革命黨就是亂黨，亂黨就是長毛，長毛是該殺的。我們常常看殺革命黨，很高興。有一回，我跟一班弟兄，也捉住一個革命黨，過了幾天就把他殺了。不料宣统三年，革命黨倒得了天下，我在那年因爲生大病就退伍出來，回到家裏，後來便賣燒餅賣山粉腐過日。在我的心裏，革命黨雖然得了天下，總是革頭王，一朝眞命天子復了位，他們總要殺光的。誰知過了十五年，眞命天子還没有出，第一批革命黨還没有消滅，第二批又出來了。我的小玉，瞞着我入了黨」。</p>
<p>說到這里，也歎了一口氣，拿起酒又呷了一口。</p>

<h3>紗花　現銷大活標紗驟漲</h3>

<h3>糧食　遠期粉買氣濃密</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、初呈平定之象、以洋麥報價、兩日來報價、互有二三角之漲落、故市塲人心、初見平平、旋以業外人之買氣、依然濃厚、不論價格、一意收買、致市面又見步昂、不過實銷客帮、鎭靜如常、所以表面上形勢雖覺良好、骨裏則仍軟弱也、迨至下午開盤、本月份因雙方均屬了結居多、市面平平、致遠期各月份、因銀錢業之買力、仍不减退、故市面又見提升、至業外之購買、其側重之點、起於美國麥區之旱災、以爲此後洋麥來華、爲不可能之事、又因一部分廠家、暗放流言、引起銀錢業之吸買、但以實際情形而言、華北實銷、一無起色、國内新麥、又值豐年、故此種無意識之購買　、此後不免爲事實所衝動也、結果本月份較小二厘半、七月份好一分二厘半、八月份好一分、九月份好一分二厘半、十月份好一分七厘半、十一月份好七厘半、</p>
<h3>產地市價帶高期麥</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈穏俏之象、以洋麥報價、雖少上落、但本地行家、因新麥雖見豐收、出貨雖亦見湧、惟以寂寞多時、急於買賣、一方在產區收買、一方則裝申待售、所以產地市面、未免帶俏、故標凖市面亦爲之略見俏利、不過亦有一部分之内地行家、從事套賣、故遠期市况、已呈不穏、此後情形、到貨方面、如果一得甘霖、必能大暢、另一方面、將看厰家之銷胃額、是否有繼續性也、結果七月份好五分、八月份好二分、九月份好四分、十月份好二分、十一月份小一分、現麥市面、略有軟弱、較前日計軟一二分、因市上到貨甚湧、客貨均求急脫、故高次各檔、已呈　勢、開大橋黄橋六合高郵麥二元八角、明光麥二元九角、次八角八分、蚌埠麥二元九角、浦口麥二元七角七分次七角半、臨淮關麥二元八角八分、采石磯麥二元七角半、次七角三分、和州麥二元七角三分、蕪湖麥二角七角、南京麥二元七角、浦東麥二元五角半、安高亭二元六角七分、蓬萊麥二元六角半、河頭麥二元六角九分、崑山麥二元七角、由福新去一萬一千包、阜豐去三千包、華豐去三千包、信大去二千包云、</p>
<h3>晚稻貨多續疲</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源三十餘號、（貨共四千五百餘石）、其中晚稻較厚粳爲夥、而去路客帮包胃又復懈淡、故市况續呈疲軟、北洋天津威海衛烟台等帮自開市袖手觀望、去胃不暢、至收市共辦靑角松泗練塘等貨一千四五百包、而吃盤又極嚴格、惟售方則以本街形勢頗緊、不願再受硬削、結果略修數分、各厚粳銷塲、店胃人心仍屬頗佳、市形殊緊、然因晚稻勢趨向下、不免被受影響、故如常帮蘇同南港等貨價祇有數分秀色、惟陰變化則以到稀、故已能回起數分矣、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船十三四艘、市上各種銷塲白粳尙佳、早薄稻續動、白元及羊杜尖胃納尙可、埠客尖續有交易、市形白粳高緊數分中次好角餘、早薄稻挺立、白元及羊杜尖價緊近角、客尖高料緊加角許、中次挺立之格、</p>
<h3>節後客秈銷化漸活</h3>
<p>昨爲節後開市、本客辦胃轉活、尤以福州帮本有暢胃、連日擯持之後、各地需要漸股、昨到市暢辦、興味殊濃、但市上有底甚足、逐有零星到埠、經多日之擯守後、行情立被擯小二三角、昨市面雖活、價已跌落、統市開出沙市漢口等六千包、贛皖八百九十包、湘米及蕪湖蚌埠各米一千二百包、總計八千二百九十一包、餘本衛去湘機元三百二十四包、内地去少數漢口糙米外、盡由閩省辦去、惟行情則較小一二三角不等、</p>
<h3>大批餅屑麩皮運日</h3>
<p>我國每年運日之雜糧肥料、爲數至鉅、前日日郵社之摩耶丸出口、裝有荳餅屑及麩皮約三千餘噸、該項貨物、均由長江運來、轉往日本之尾道市、又今日出口之生駒丸、裝有蠶荳百餘噸菜子七十餘噸云、</p>
<h3>甬江新菜籽開四元　黄豆一味下游</h3>
<p>雜糧新貨市况、蠶荳似已跌定、昨開嘉定白蠶六七百包、價爲三元、甬江白蠶開百餘包、價爲二元二角六及二角、温州白蠶開二元四角半、閔行靑蠶開三百餘包、價爲二元九角、崇明沙田靑蠶三四百包、價爲二元五角、又成八月份交貨二千包、價爲二元三角、菜籽趨勢疲軟、昨甬江新籽首次抵一百五十包、價開四元、貨品尙佳、九江貨開三百餘包、價爲三元四角、近來黄荳市面、自連電回跌後、市氣一味下游、廠家雖動、但非賤不進、行情較上週又跌五六分不等、來貨方面、車輪陸續有到、刻下交易所期荳跌風甚熾、故現荳一時恐難看好也、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮靑糖號盤仍擯持中</h3>
<p>昨糖市以節後人心未見發動、厥狀穏定、公會劃盤如二四號粗砂白二十元○六角三分、轉口貨六元七角、成交數百包、八九號嗬赤仍十五元七八角、一號本廠白十九元、一角五分、零星亦有做出、太古糖B嘜喊二十元○八角、無交、國產</p>

<h3>南北貨　桂圓銷滯續跌</h3>
<p>雜路桂圓、以銷路久寂、市疲一蹶不振、行方鑒於霉汛將迫、更不敢買進、故號盤亦久無開出、從形勢推測、此去殊榮少辱多也、茲錄最近行家剪圓賣盤如下、頂極四十六元、天吉三十五元、天宏二十三元、出瓣十三元、正二售十元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外日絲傾售頗力</h3>
<p>▲里昂廠經猛跌　里昂生絲市塲、近因日新絲貶價傾售頗力、華絲市價隨之猛跌、Ａ級白廠經金雙鹿牌十三十五條份、每基羅祇開六十一法郎、計跌五法郎、扯合華幣毎祇六百十餘元、約小五十餘元、雙特號信昌本牌九至十一條份、毎基羅亦祇開六十七法郎二五云、</p>
<p>▲華絲運法　前日法郵船安得來　號出口、祇信孚等有黄白廠經八十一包裝往　　等埠、　　▲洋莊絲銷閒散　昨日本埠洋莊絲銷閒散、歐美市塲、日絲充斥、傾銷不懈、華絲無人問訊、滬埠絲電不轉、華洋雙方均觀望不動、市氣益淸、昨祇印莊進黄白粗絲八包、價仍　疲、</p>
<h3>平水綠茶歐銷略動</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、紹興平水綠茶、歐銷略見活動、惟因市面疲滯已久、各茶市盤、均一致降低、優等頭號珠茶、縮至八十元、較前减低七八元、至路莊珍眉綠茶、英莊怡和洋行、進胃極大、　他行家、亦均有零星購進、市勢依然堅挺、祁　浮梁等路紅茶、俄莊恊助會洋行、進意轉　濃厚、花香一項、英俄兩莊去路、尤爲活潑、紅茶市面、尙較綠茶爲佳、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>師道</h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>記得前一些時也曾閙過師道的問題，似乎是師生兩方面各祭起法寳在空中，鬥法，而結果是否勝負不分，或者是個死個活，可惜沒有下文。如今又有人大喊維持師道的尊嚴，而且是發了宣言要和對方勢不兩立，可是宣言的對象却並非學生，而是同一方面的老師。師生鬥法本來已經煞是好看，這回是老師和老師鬥法，法力如不相上下，那就更加熱閙。聽說某一個地方的鄉下的私塾老師和學堂老師有一次在鬥法的時候，一方是標榜着有圖畫手工唱歌體操的功課，一方是號召着敎四書五經左傳東萊博議的聖賢書，結果是私塾老師約期比試八股文、學堂老師「棄權」掛了白旗。如今學堂老師和學堂老師鬥法，自然是誰都在敎着圖畫手工唱歌體操的，學術的比試已經不用提起，那恐怕是要顯出學術以外的法寳了。這種學術以外的法寳，那是各有各的神通，不知道比試的結果，是不是勝負不分，沒有下文，還是毛厠越攪越臭，引起敎育界「尊嚴」之地，變成其臭難聞之塲。如果不幸言中，那末本意在維持尊嚴，而反成自己出馬打倒</p>
<p>尊嚴了。</p>
<p>師道本是尊嚴的，一有所爭已經失去了尊嚴，爭之不已以至鬥法，連師道都扔下毛厠去了，不知後事如何，眞是爲敎育前途担心。</p>
<h3>爺爺</h3>
<p>— 若望</p>
<p>毎次從外邊回來，總看見唐老頭子坐在客堂間裏，看見我，對我微笑着頓一頓頭，怪閒靜地。</p>
<p>『老先生，你早呀，』晨間他起得很早，聽見我說，依然怪閒靜地微笑着頓一頓頭。</p>
<p>唐老頭子這種和氣待人，常常使我想跟他寒暄幾句，但是每跟他說话，他說祇是微笑着頓一頓頭，却是不說话。　　客堂間裏養着一盆金魚，金魚祇吹水泡，不會說话，這便是唐老頭子唯一解悶的東西。餘外，還有一隻鳥籠，可</p>
<p>是籠裏的鳥已經死了，祇剩下直條條的</p>
<p>小竹栅。晒台上也還種着一盆小天竹，兩棵鳳仙花，毎天下午他到晒台上去澆水，於是鳳仙花一天天的大了，時光是一天天的過着。</p>
<p>『爺爺，爺爺！』唐老頭子的孫兒從學校裏回來了，呌他的時候，他不答應。媳婦房裏的收音機哼出怪迷人的小曲，他也不要聽，他祇閒靜地在客堂間裏坐着。</p>
<p>『爺爺，聽！爺爺，聽！』孫兒把他拖着去聽收音機，他的媳婦便站起來附到他耳朶邊指收音機說：『這裏邊有人說話的。』這說話的聲音不是說，是呌喊，但是他還不大明白的說的什麽，等到再呌了幾次，他於是乎異常吃驚，用着大聲說：『眞的嗎？眞的嗎？』他媳婦點了點頭，他便把耳朶傾靠在收音機上，他笑了，無聲的笑，笑得閉不上嘴。從此以後，他知道這個木頭匣子裏有說話的聲音。</p>
<p>孫兒和爺爺是住在亭間裏的一張床上的，因爲爺爺毎天都給他銅板，他便離遠了嚴厲的父親，疏遠了娘，他祇要爺爺，似乎這世界上祇有爺爺是愛他的。</p>
<p>『爺爺來，爺爺來！』孫兒被媳婦打了求爺爺救，爺爺不睬，不是不睬，是爺爺沒有聽見。</p>
<p>有一天唐老頭子身邊沒有錢買烟抽了，自然也沒有另錢給孫兒了，孫兒哭着要，唐老頭子也發脾氣了，平素少言語的人，這時變得異常話多，從樓上呌起呌到樓下去，從樓下又呌到樓上來，一老一小把一家的空氣一弄堂的人心都閙翻了。</p>
<p>但是這閙是老毛病，並不是沒有方法治。</p>
<p>『爺爺，這是兩塊錢，這是一匣香烟。』唐老頭子的媳婦老用這個方法來治老頭子的閙，果然，這是一匣萬應藥膏，老頭子的嘴立刻被淡味的紙烟塞住了，手牽着孫兒的手，送他上學校。</p>
<p>不一刻兒，唐老頭重新把耳朶傾靠在收音機上，收音機裏唱着迷人的小曲，他聽着笑了，默默地笑着。</p>
<h3>知識與道德</h3>
<p>— 乃碩</p>
<p>人類道德，不能謂非是一件不重要的事件。但世界上，有把道德看得很重，却又並未得着若何成效。反之，並不如何提倡道德，却道德自然高尙。比方咱們貴國，就是非常注重道德的，而西洋却並不期期於此。這可以從許多有名的敎育家學者的言論中看出，且讓我約略的來引證一番。</p>
<p>在咱們中國，從前發蒙時所讀的一本三字經，就幾乎全是道德的說敎，換句話說，中國人以爲若想道德高尙的，是非從書本上敎育上儘力灌注不可。所以三字經上有：「苟不敎，性乃遷，」中庸上有：「率性之謂道，修道之謂敎，」總之孔孟的大業，孜孜以爲垂訓的，是：「講德道，說仁義，」就是宋明學者的所謂「明心見性」，「希聖希賢」，也都是崇尙道德的極致。</p>
<p>這在西洋則逈乎有異，他們對於兒童以至靑年成年，在敎育上所表現的是注重知識的發展，幾乎不知道有什麽道德，是我們人類平時應當修養的。在修學上他們是注重辯論術，文法，口令等。大哲學家蘇格拉底有過這樣的名言：「知識卽道德」！卽是人們只要獲得有知識，就有高尙的道德。康德一生的問題是：「吾人能知道甚麽」？更是特别的注重知識。培根更主張「知識卽權力」，杜威主張「創造的知慧」。由這許多的例證看來，西洋確實是只注重知識的發展，對道德是無所謂也。</p>
<p>因爲歷來中西敎育學說之不同，所以知識與道德乃爲極迷糊而亟待解决之一問題。</p>
<p>近來許多的敎育家以及一般的學校對於道德一科的處置各有不同。重視道德者，乃把「修身」「公民」「精神講話」「讀經」，當作毎個學生的必修科。輕視道德者，根本沒有道德的學科。還有注重平日訓練而不注重課堂講授者，以爲道德訓練應由訓導處職掌，在課堂裏是用不着嘵嘴的　　這三者，說來各有錯誤，前者是犯了把道德只看作一種知識，免不了坐而言不能起而行的毛病。中者是犯了太重視實際生活，忽略了人與人的關係，斷難使人人格健全。末者的錯誤，卽等於社會法庭之錯誤，只能以法制學生而不能使學生道德化。</p>
<p>現在我們要說的是：「道德到底是什麽」？概言之，它是人與人的關係中的法則，而這法則却又是自然的。是由平日的習慣而形成，形成以後，乃就成了法則，例如中國戀愛間的道德，漸漸由西洋傳來，漸漸成爲習慣，至現在乃有法律上的明文了。而其内容則不外是：（一）知識，（二）感情，（三）意志，三者鎔成一體。子孝其親是道德，小孩墮水，我們去援救，也就是這三種原素構成的行爲，也就是道德。</p>
<p>至於道德之表現，是主觀與客觀二方面的，主觀是動機，客觀是結果，唯心派主張主觀（良心），而唯物派則主張結果，這兩派在倫理學上是千古難泯的論戰。</p>
<p>而道德的存在，以至表現，則是隨社會而變化的，質言之，是隨一般的生產關係而變化而隨時不同的。它有時間性，也有空間性，例如夫妻間的道德，就可作個說明，在人類未開化以前，男女亂交是道德的，其後進爲一妻多夫，再進爲一夫多妻，又進爲一夫一妻，都是合乎當時的生產關係而來的。其空間性亦復如此，上海的道德與北平的不同，美國的道德與中國的又不同。</p>
<p>至於道德與知識原是聯緊的，絕對不是對立的。可以說道德是知識的推廣，是趨利避害的行徑。孟子見齊宣王，從恿他行仁政，齊宣王曰：『我好財貨，又好色』，孟子曰：「那都是無妨的，只要把它推廣，使「内無怨女，外無曠夫」，那麽好色也就是偉大的了」。</p>
<p>然而我們對於道德應取何種態度？尤其對於學生應怎樣的去訓練？這我有下面的幾項意見：</p>
<p>（一）學校對道德一科應特别注重。</p>
<p>（二）但又不應特列專科。</p>
<p>（三）更不應專恃規律之訓練。</p>
<p>（四）所謂人格的感化，其效力實至微小。</p>
<p>（五）陶養學生道德應使學生生活社會化，生活社會化，則其人生必極充實，也就是朋友多的人，其道德程度一定比一般的人來得高尙，俗語有云，十個麻子有九個陰狠，其原因就是因爲他在年少的時候，小孩都不高興與他在一塊，使他的生活孤獨化了，同時他也就永遠視他人如仇敵，所以養成了他的陰狠的性根。若單從書本中去找道德，那是不可能的，卽能也是靠不住的，所以學生的道德的培養，應使其生活社會化做起</p>
<h3>進行曲</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>１一個戰士的日記１</p>
<p>人數並不很多，兩個號兵，二十幾名兄弟，蛇行的在那漫天的山野裏，脚步，是那樣的輕悄，甚至連心底脈動的聲息都能極淸晰地聽得到。天上，沒有烏雲，下弦的斜月吊掛在天之一角，幾點稀星在閃耀着。他們不說什麽，由那月華的投射裏，像隻大的爬虫似的在悠悠地山腰裏蠕動。</p>
<p>「噓噓噓１」一聲幽亮的音響，拉得很長，突破了這死悶的空圍。隨着爲首的爬虫停住了，驚異顯現在各個人的臉上。</p>
<p>１莫非這次的計畫，已被敵人識破？各個的心裏浮蕩着這樣的念頭，雖則大家都沒有知道到底是爲着什麽。</p>
<p>「倒！倒下去！」彷彿有一種共同的力量同時的支配着他們的身子，不自覺的，在隨同着前面的人伏了下去。緊張，佔有了整個的情緒。</p>
<p>遠處不見什麽，山風呼嘯着，一些枯枝在颯颯地響。突的，那枯樹裏，電箇亮了兩下，光，並不很强，許是距離得還遠吧？只像一隻夜螢的尾光一樣。</p>
<p>逐漸的，聽見了對方的脚聲，卽刻的，伙伴們在振奮着，期待着，那將被受宰的羔羊。</p>
<p>「護。」更近了，他似乎已發覺到這</p>
<p>方的凖備。於此，他吐出了那緊急的口令，更迅速的向這面狂奔着！</p>
<p>「排長，敵人現在石咀子的附近，以情形看去，似乎有起遷的模樣！」探子在喘息着說。</p>
<p>一轉眼，探子又怱忙的遁去了，大虫仍繼續地爬行着。</p>
<p>１喂，馬當，你不要說敵人的人數不多，但他們也很利害呢！</p>
<p>１什麽？利害？哼！他們有手，我們呢？沒有嗎？</p>
<p>１不是，他們的武器很兇呢！</p>
<p>１怎麽？只有武器能兇麽？那些，是毫不足怕的，牠是相差數倍於我們懹恨的心情喲！</p>
<p>轉過了田啞子，已到了另外的一個</p>
<p>山頭，從高的地方向四周瞭望一下瞧山窪裏，是黑黝黝地，山背上，像雲霧似的舗了一層暗淡的薄紗；這時，月兒換搖地欲墜，景色，開始在糢糊中泛起了一些極混沌的輪廓。</p>
<p>「停住！」排長用望遠鏡眺望了以後說：「西南角上，已看見了敵人的炊烟，這面，我們要更輕巧的爬了過去，每</p>

<p>人的距離不妨稍遠一點？」</p>
<p>在離石咀子不到一里路的一個小山坡，他們駐住了，刺刀極快的裝上了他們的槍頭，腰帶更勒得緊了些；細胞暴跳着，血液，更增快了速率，不覺得累，也不覺得飢，眼睛裏，只有些火辣辣地。</p>
<p>１弟兄們，進吧，生存的意義，正肩負在我們的身上。弟兄們，看！他們</p>
<p>不是已在預備着起程嗎？這，多好的一個機會呵，走，趕緊的，進吧！</p>
<p>到相距最近的時候，一致的舉起了雪亮的鋒刀，往正在起行的敵陣裏殺去。形勢像海濤似的滚進了敵人的垓心，不及措手的，敵人倒退了。</p>
<p>鮮明的旗幟在迎風飛舞着，這，正當日出前黎明的時候。</p>
<h3>賣藝者</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>每當黄昏的時候。暮色蒼茫中，在這些長街與長街之間，老是瞧見一對街頭賣藝者。一個拉着胡弦，一個唱着歌，沿着長街的住屋一直走去，走過每一家屋前時，便扮了笑臉問着要不要來一隻曲子，然而很少會這樣兜上生意，而且往往被無情的趕出來，因爲他身上穿的是一付流浪人破爛污髒的衣服。會呌人一看作恶的。男的跟女的年紀的相差，大約父親和女兒一樣，他們到底是不是父女的關係，可不知道，而亦不曾有人去留意。在那些地方不知消磨過多少日子了。不論是雨天是睛天，一到了萬家燈光燦爛的黄昏，便聽見那凄蒼而鬱悴的弦音，和淸脆而怨抑的歌聲，一輕一重地，在微茫的靜寂的空中流蕩着。在這些長街之間流蕩着，輕輕地擾亂了一角寂寞的空氣。</p>
<p>在一個外國兵營的窗口上，蹲着幾個士兵，並沒有人呌他們唱，他們兩個却在人行道上站住了。男的沒完沒結把胡弦拉了好一會，接着女的便張開喉管唱起來了。聲音是淸麗的，可是毎個音符裏面都載着沉重的憂鬱感，和塗抹在他們臉上的憂鬱的表情一樣。幾個兵士裝着詼諧的嘴巴，貪婪的笑着，目不轉睛的釘視着女人的身上，咕嚕咕嚕的不知在說些什麽話。那女人一面營養不足的黄色的瘦臉龐，亂蓬蓬的頭髮拖到額際上邊。但是面目倒有幾分俊俏，如果加以一番裝扮，穿上挺時髦的華麗的衣服，大概和那汽車裏面的闊小姐亦不見有什麽差别吧。可是，她是一個街頭賣藝的流浪少女啊！她給兵士們瞧的有些窘迫起來，於是轉了身子，背着牆，然而另一面又圍着三五個像無賴的漢子，亦同樣地以猥邪的眼睛死瞟着她。使她低垂下了腦袋，眼珠瞅着地面，再也不敢抬上來。圍繞着的人儘管嘻嘻地笑着，說着，甚至於調戲着，這是很明顯的，這些人對於他們兩個自然不會有什麽同情，而是懷着一種卑鄙的心。</p>
<p>曲子唱完，胡弦停了，有的已先一跨腿走開，男人伸着手，望他們一半是乞求的說：「先生給幾個銅板吧！」</p>
<p>大家都打着鬼臉，一個個各自散了。瞧着散去的人們，他兩個同時深深地嘆了一口氣。夜的黑翅膀已蓋在頭上，街道舗滿了明亮的燈光。然而他們的心是空洞的，飢餓的，彼此無言地相視了一下，又默默的走了。</p>
<p>命運賜予他們的是一塊黑色的　，沒有光，沒有感情。毎天跑折了腿，嘶破了咽喉，換得一口兒冷飯，換得更多的侮辱和奚落。少女的靑春便這樣地消磨於街頭下流的調笑中，可憐的人啊！</p>
<h3>智多星</h3>
<p>— 不掦</p>
<p>别小覻他人矮，肚子裏的疙瘩多着哩！</p>
<p>高額角表示他聰敏；尖下巴表示他精幹；多肚腸表示他會心算；眞的，他具有三個臭皮匠的智慧。當人家竪起大拇指稱他智多星的時候，他總是得意地接受着。</p>
<p>智多星的典型是應該這樣的。</p>
<p>他姓朱，從前的名字是一位搖頭擺脚的老童生給他取的：「德培」，可是他覺着「培」是「敗」的轉音，對於多智一方面是受着影響的。於是他放開慧眼向自己看過的稗官小說上找去，突然在目錄裏發現旗開得勝的字句，於是貯在高額角裏的腦膜很快的觸動一下：</p>
<p>！！得勝！</p>
<p>尖下巴抽動着，他覺着這名字很合自己的身份。</p>
<p>當然，智多星是應該旗開得勝的。　　有時他還會懷疑自己的姓氏：「朱」「豬」怪難聽的，可是那不掙氣的老貨偏偏和屠塲裏的畜生同姓「聲」。假使姓眞的可以更換的話，那末他一定改姓趙１翻開百家姓就是的那個趙。可是不能够，他捨不得那老貨牛像掙來的財產。</p>
<p>「智多星」「朱得勝」，諧音格，他佩服自己姓名的玄妙。</p>
<p>智多星最忌的是人家呌他「矮子」，可是事實上，他的確比别人矮得多，坐在櫈子上像猴似的，兩脚老是虚懸着。他時常想把身體改造過，改造得和别人一樣長，可是身體不是名字，可以隨他自由更動的！</p>
<p>於是多智的他就預備千篇一列的答案，只要有人觸犯他就很快的還擊過去。</p>
<p>１矮子！　　１矮您的兒子！　　他勝利地笑了，於是别人也笑了。　　１矮子！</p>
<p>矮您的兒子。　　他又勝利地笑了。</p>
<h3>當太陽還未東升時</h3>
<p>— 澍白</p>
<p>天色朦朧，離早晨曦光升起的時候該已不遠了吧！</p>
<p>大地靜悄悄地無聲，像這個世界已死了似的；從樹梢吹來的夜風還使人感覺到一點寒慄，雖說時候已在初夏，月亮已失去了她故有的光芒，星星也已停止熌爍着她的媚眼，因爲她們的命運已被淘汰，而另一個更有着生命活氣的太陽，將衝破這黑夜，代替了那月亮星星來照耀出另一個有着像玫瑰花般芬芳的世界。</p>
<p>但是時間像一匹笨牛般的在走着一毫沒有帶來淸晨曦光的意思；時常有一二顆星星突然的發亮着，像還在午夜一樣。烏雲也重層的遮蓋着從東邊升起來的一點曙光，是在傍晚吧？人們疑惑着。</p>
<p>但是宇宙間的一切已從黑夜的睡夢中醒過來了。假使我們仔細的聽着，那海水在澎湃，牠會衝破岸堤，淹沒了這一個睡着的世界；麻雀也睜開眼珠在窠裏低聲的啾唧，待着那光明的來到而作一個遙遠的征途。玫瑰也堅直了嬌軀慢慢的在展開花瓣，以待淸晨時放出她底芬芳；一切都是凖備了，祇等待着光明的來到。空氣所以刺人地感覺到一點寒意，這因爲黑暗在和光明爭札緊漲的緣故。</p>
<p>淸晨還未來到，而石榴花的樹葉已被黑夜的寒風吹落了不少。那麽，温和的曙光爲什麽還不照臨到這黑暗的世界？然而淸晨是無疑的會來到的，雖說黑雲還時常蓋去了東方天際的曙光，星星也時常的熌爍着她的光煇，但是這一切都是要消滅的，黑雲終久會被光明的太陽衝破，星星終也會在光明的照耀下央去了她底生命，因爲這是她們的末日已到，已不是她們底力量所能挽回。</p>
<p>那麽，我們待着吧，待着光明的，芬芳的，温和的淸晨曦的光的來到！</p>

<h3>節母坊（五）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>這時時敏呆呆的站在那裏，不哭亦不笑，但總覺得自己怪不自然的。他想他們是相熟的一羣，而自己却是孤單單的一個。在自己身邊不遠，他聽見一個騎在牛背上的孩子低聲的和另一孩子說：</p>
<p>「上次我的牛在路上走，偸偸的吃了一口正輔公公家裏的禾，給他家裏的長工看見了，便一掌打在我的臉上，還說要牽我的牛去。」　　「可不是麽？」另一孩子應着說：「他家裏的人眞是可惡極了。」　　這在時敏聽來，未免覺得怪不舒服的，那些都是他不認識的人，可是他們都在談論着關於他家裏的事。忽然聽見一個爬在牌坊上的孩子說：</p>
<p>「喂，時敏，你要嗎？我給你敲一個菩薩下來。」　　時敏覺得非常高興，連忙點着頭。於是那孩子又爬下來，拿了一塊石頭上去。那牌坊上彫了許多石人，有的是騎着馬，前面又有人掌着旗，都是穿着胃甲的，好像戲台上的二花臉一樣。再有的是花園，橋，房子之類，還有鳥寵，可惜都是高高的，拿不下來。頂上面有一方直扁，上面寫着聖旨二字，這是他認得的。下面是萬古流芳四個字，再下面是一塊長扁額，寫的是史母劉太夫人貞節坊幾個。那些字大概從前都是貼了金的，可是現在却褪色了。　　那孩子在上面敲着那個人頭，看上去似乎非常吃力，因爲他的手不够長，差不多是三寸的距離，他不能很方便的將那小石像敲下來。時敏覺得很替他擔心，生怕他跌下來，忽然他聽見一個粗壯的聲音在他背後吆喝着，他回轉頭來，却看見是灰鷄婆哥站在那圓洞門的當中，裝着非常可怕的臉，在駡那小孩兒不應該敲破石牌坊，於是那孩子很害怕的爬下來，對於灰鷄婆，簡直不敢正望一下。可是他還在駡着：</p>
<p>「你這小野種，你不怕死麽？昨天時敏的爸爸還說，『村裏的牌坊給人家」</p>
<p>敲得一塌糊塗，眞是大可惜了······。』原來就是你們這班小野種弄壞了的。看罷回頭給時敏的爸爸知道了，總看見你的屁股打　好看哩。」</p>

<h3>好萊塢　幾個著名女星的薪</h3>
<p>— 金鶴琴</p>
<p>我們時常聽到人說好萊塢的明星是賺極大的薪金。但不知他們究竟賺多大。關於這個問題那些明星是極守秘密的，因恐給人曉得了，要引起一般匪類的覬觎。爲了外界不曉得他們的實數，因此好萊塢就有很多人喜歡把他們薪金的數目，胡亂加以猜測，說那邊那些大明星至少有數萬美金一月，甚而也有賺幾十萬一月的，因此消息傳佈開來，全世界都以爲他們的薪金是了不得的了！其實他們的薪金也並不是謠傳的那麽大。</p>
<p>本來，我們也不能曉得，因爲不久以前琪恩哈羅因要求米高美公司加薪，未得如願，她氣不過，於是就把幾個有名女星薪金實數都說了出來。原來她在本年度全好萊塢女明星競選中是獲得第三席，而她的薪金連比第十名還不到一半，無怪要把這個潑辣明星氣得發跳了。現在我把她所說的前十名女明星的薪金實數，譯述在下面：</p>
<p>（一）曼麗特蘭漱１１每星期三千五百美金　　（二）珍妮蓋諾１１１每星期四千五百美金　　（三）琪恩哈羅１１１毎星期一千五百美金　　（四）瓊克勞馥１１１每星期四千五百美金　　（五）葛雷泰嘉寳１１每星期九千美金　　（六）梅惠絲脫１１１每部片子需七萬美金　　（七）康絲頓絲白納１每星期七千美金　　（八）露絲蔡頓１１１毎星期七千五百美金　　（九）恩哈婷１１１１每星期六千美金　　（十）瑪琳黛曲麗許１毎星期五千美金</p>
<p>（按以上名次是依競選中的位子排定的，並非依薪水的高低而定的）　　從以上的薪水表裏看來，神秘女郎葛雷泰嘉寳到底是賺得最大，老牌皇后曼麗特蘭漱雖名稱第一，而她的薪金除琪恩哈羅外十個女明星中可說是最低，可見皇后牌子雖老，究竟比不上神秘女郎的吸力偉大。這個潑辣女星琪恩哈羅，以一極輕年紀明星，竟能在數千女明星中得高佔第三席，的確魔力也是不少。可是影片公司老板因她年紀輕，資格嫩，究竟還不買她的賬，不肯把她薪金增到和老牌明星一樣，無怪她要失望了，其實她的薪金也不能說小了，較之我國女明星幾十元一月，眞有天壤之别了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>寫於觀「漁光曲」後</h3>
<p>— 乃煌</p>
<p>「漁光曲」因爲編劇者的精心結構，所以能够使劇情的首尾精神飽滿，若論編劇上的價値，是値得我們注意的。　　「漁光曲」的題材是用漁民們地獄一般的生活，來博得觀衆們的同情，它寫漁户方面生活的艱難，受寃枉，進牢獄，卒被火燒身死，同時富人們家庭的不幸，經理舞弊，妻子捲逃，股東相逼，卒至自殺，也一一寫出。</p>
<p>但是事實上也有不妥的地方，姑且舉出兩點來講。</p>
<p>一，十匪來的時候，决不會先搶貧人，而不搶富人的。</p>
<p>二，的確這一點是最大錯誤，什麽漁民區裏，竟有這樣一幢堡壘似的房子，因爲事實上是不會有的。</p>
<p>以一二點是「漁光曲」的缺點，也許是一時的粗心吧！但因它對於漁民的生活，和富人的生活，都有深刻的描寫，所以終於能够收到極好的效果。</p>
<p>至於演員方面都很努力，王人美很不差，動作上也很自然，但是韓蘭根有一些做作，其餘諸人多還可以。</p>
<p>攝影方面，倒很靈活，所以能够使「漁光曲」，成一精美的畫面。</p>
<p>總之「漁光曲」的確和「姊妹花」是不相上下，它是蔡楚生導演的成功作。也是聯華本年度最佳的出品。</p>
<h3>「漁光曲」我談</h3>
<p>— 杜存杰</p>
<p>確然！「漁光曲」又是聯華底一部有力的作品。</p>
<p>同時，也是繼續「人生」之後中國銀壇的一部出類拔萃的作品，該是無可否認的事實！</p>
<p>當畫面的展開，卽見東海裏陽光剛從蒼翠的東山漸漸的升上來，朝霞映照着動盪而激流的波浪中，漁人們在海面上悠揚地唱着悅耳的歌曲：：：漁光曲，多麽的充滿着詩情底一張畫圖哪！</p>
<p>可是，谁知他們背面的痛苦和慘劇？</p>
<p>演出大都稱心滿意，特别是火燒的一個塲面。</p>
<p>不過話得說回來，本片自然多少不免有它瑕疵的地方：如字幕尙欠簡潔，而導演對比的手法亦似嫌太多。</p>
<p>總之，「漁光曲」不失爲嫓美「人生」的作品啦。</p>
<h3>觀「王先生」後</h3>
<p>— 冠雲</p>
<p>葉淺予所作的「王先生」漫畫，由天一公司搬上了銀幕我爲了素來喜歡看葉君的漫畫，所以到北京去看了一次。影終人散以後，覺得對於該片有些不很滿意的地方，現在姑且舉出幾點來談談：</p>
<p>一　小陳的太太在出門看電影之前，要小陳陪她同去，除了小陳的裝肚子痛了那飾陳太太的舒麗娟是一無表情，而鏡頭就嫌太冗長了。</p>
<p>二·王先生在戲院中逃出來，撞倒了人而再溜走，也是一個多餘的鏡頭。</p>
<p>三·鞋店中二個胖子的幾次吵嘴，打架，不見其所謂幽默，只是胡閙而已。</p>
<p>四·王先生的釘梢，以及釘梢的結果，不看說明書簡直是使人莫明其妙的。</p>
<p>五·小陳與王柳如到了跳舞塲，應該來一個跳舞的鏡頭，而再閙出一點笑話，但是映出來的却是幾個西洋女子的舞蹈。</p>
<p>六·結局所謂的「一塲風波，引起了全舞塲的人哄堂大笑」也沒有演出來。</p>
<p>至於說員方面，大體還一差，攝影與佈景也很好。聽說天一公司還要拍續集「？」，我們希望他能够内容充實一點，努力的去幹，使得牠在國產滑稽片中放一異彩。</p>
<h3>好萊塢的四角戰爭開始了</h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>孩子們，孩子們，戰爭開始了。一圈就定了嗎？還是十圈八圈永不停止的呢？好萊塢出現了這四大金剛，可以說影界沒有安靜的日子，這四大金剛，就是嘉寳，黛德麗許，貝格娜，和史丹四個女明星。</p>
<p>葛雷泰嘉寳的後台老板是米曲羅。派拉蒙正在爲瑪琳黛德麗許搖旗呐喊着。沈克和聯藝公司則竭力慫恿着貝格娜。突然間桑高文又掮出了安娜史丹的金字招牌。好萊塢好似一個大雷台，看她們四個人到底誰的法力大。不過我們可以預先替她們估計一下：</p>
<p>嘉寳女士具有無限的威望。她的個性是不可思議的，她的好鏡頭，全靠着她一個人的獨脚戲！祇要她那副充滿悲劇意味的面龐，就足够了。黛德麗女士呢？她是最富有性感的女星，她有誘惑的個性。她在演戲的時候，祇要稍爲着力，就極動人，眞是輕而易舉，事半功倍。貝格娜是位優良的女伶。她的才能是無所不備的！聰明，細膩，輕鬆，奇特，悲哀。她在凱塞琳女皇中的成就，是别人不可望的成就。但她並不具有驚人的美貌，亦缺少靑年的魔力。至於安娜史丹呢，她所擅長而爲其餘三人所不可及的，就是她美貌動人。她的表演亦頗不惡。她的身段苗條，確是個無上的衣架子，但是她的美貌尤其是光彩四射，不可向邇。</p>
<p>她們四個人都不是美國的土產，一個是瑞典的，一個是德國的，一個是英國的，一個是俄國的，但是她們的製片家，都拿她們當作奇貨，互相爭競起來。他們不顧一切地，不惜鉅萬金錢的，各人都在將他所標榜明星捧上去。這　競爭已經開始了，什麽時候才可以分一高低呢？</p>
<p>聯華一廠，費穆繼「人生」編導的「香雪海」，在題材上這戲是創立了新的格調，但它不對封建殘餘舊農村的不自由婚姻加以抨擊與正當啓示，而且對於宗法社會也有新的理解。這部片子將來出演，不消說，中國銀壇又是一個絕大的榮譽收穫。</p>
<p>日前，拍阿素（阮玲玉）入菴爲尼一幕，情景非常凄凉。阿素爲了自己的兒子發下了宏願，她以爲兒子的不死是神的力量，便去爲尼，她的丈夫阿根，（高占非）和她的小兒（黎鏗）那裏肯讓她去，但她是很堅决的，當阿根領着小兒到尼菴來哀求她回去時，他們都痛哭失聲了。這時全塲空氣十分緊張而又慘淡，各工作人員都給他們哭得心弦有些發顫。等這一個鏡頭拍完後大家都不則一顫，只見阮玲玉拭着淚去坐在一張椅子上，黎鏗嗚咽的倚着她，老高是默默地抱着拳頭坐在一塊假山石上眼看着地。　　一旁許多參觀士女們，這時臉然色都是很靜的把視綫放在他們三人的身上。</p>

<h3>Correcting the Misunderstandings of the Two Terms "Democracy" and "Modern"; President Wang's Speech at the National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang reported at the National Government Memorial Week on the 18th, entitled "Correcting the Misunderstandings of One or Two Slogans." One was "Regarding Democracy" and the other was "Regarding Modern." The general idea is as follows: (1) Regarding democracy, the report last week on the establishment of a Tax Supervision Committee in the Ministry of Finance and the establishment of Tax Supervision Committees in various provinces and cities has been submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan based on the resolutions of the Financial Conference, and has been forwarded to the Central Political Council for record. Although this kind of organization is not formal, it can be effective for the reorganization and supervision of taxes with the participation of the people. Some people say, now is the period of political tutelage, why promote this kind of democratic system method? It has been said in the report last week that the period of political tutelage is to train the people to exercise political power. In the constitutional period, the people's training is mature, and they can exercise political power. One is being trained, and the other is already mature in training. The need for the expression of the people's power and meaning is the same. The people's power and the political system are two different things. The political system is divided into decentralization and centralization. Decentralization can avoid arbitrariness, but its drawbacks are laxity and slowness. As for centralization, it can increase political efficiency and solve problems quickly, but its drawbacks are that it is easy to become arbitrary and make the people puppets. The system is not absolutely certain. Recently, political organizations have gradually tended to centralization. Italy under fascist rule and Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party are certainly like this. Even in the United States, which is known for its perfect democratic politics, the US Congress recently granted great power to President Roosevelt to handle government affairs to save the economic crisis. These are all system problems, or can be said to be administrative technical problems and have nothing to do with the essence of democracy, because decentralization and centralization both have prerequisite problems, that is, the problem of people's power. The so-called people's power includes both ability and power. On the one hand, there must be political, economic, and educational abilities of all kinds, and on the other hand, there must be the power to participate in politics. If the people have power, decentralization and centralization can be implemented. On the contrary, if the people have no power, decentralization is easy to create a habit of laxity and slowness, and centralization is even easier to create the drawbacks of puppets and fish meat. China today has only two problems. One is that due to economic, educational, and other reasons, the ability of the Chinese people is very weak, so we must encourage production and construction to increase the people's power. The second is that the Chinese people have been liberated from the autocratic political system and must be trained to exercise political power. The people have the power and can exercise their power, and then they can participate in politics. All of this should be trained from today, led to realize, and never achieved overnight. In short, the prerequisite problem today is the problem of people's power. If the people have power, the political system is just a technical problem. If the people have no power, politics is just like water without a source and a tree without roots. There is no system to speak of. (2) Regarding Modern, the word "modern" is translated from the French Moderne, which means modern. At present, China is lagging behind in everything and is working hard to become a modern country and a modern society. For example, the New Life Movement is modern life, and modern systems have gradually improved from previous generations. The word modern not only contains the meaning of being suitable for today, but also contains the meaning of analyzing, detailing, deliberating, and choosing what is passed down from previous generations to become more progressive. Translating "modern" as modern makes its meaning vague and unclear, and even opposes it, which should be corrected. It is pointless to oppose fashion because of opposing modern, and it is even more impossible to oppose the present age because of opposing modern. May I ask, if China does not strive to become a modern country and a modern society, does it want to restore the past? Can restoration save the country and survive? Therefore, modern social morality and social discipline cannot be reconciled with restoration thoughts. Do we still train the people with modern social morality and social discipline, or do we use the restoration mentality to hinder all progress? This is something that those who pay attention to social problems cannot ignore. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Reports; Criticisms of the Constitutional Draft from Various Parties; At the Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 135th Memorial Week at 8:00 am on the 18th. Chen Guofu, Sun Ke, Deng Jiayan, Liu Shouzhong, Wang Zhengting, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Fu Rulin, Xie Zuomin, Miao Peicheng, Yang Hu, Luo Jialun, Gu Zhenggang, and all staff members, totaling more than 500 people, attended. Chairman Sun Ke presided over the meeting and reported, saying that the first draft of the constitution has been promulgated for several months and has received many criticisms, which can be roughly divided into two factions. Due to different positions, the criticisms are also different. One faction is based on the Three Principles of the People, while the other faction opposes taking the Three Principles of the People as the principle of national construction. The former is appropriate and has made many contributions, while the latter is the tone of the opposition and obliterates China's forty years of revolutionary history. In addition, there are liberals who say that the chapter on people's rights does not list the guarantees of people's freedom, and there are rigid regulations. There are also those who advocate that the National Assembly should meet every year, and that the election method should be based on the population ratio and occupation. There are also those who say that the government organization is very complicated, and that there is no need to set up five courts to implement the five powers. The president is responsible for actual administrative responsibilities. Since there is an Executive Yuan, there is no need for a National Government. There are also those who advocate that the provincial government should be regarded as a sub-region of the central government. As for the power of the party, whether it is political tutelage or constitutional government, it can represent the people in charge, and the responsibility of the party is not over when it comes to constitutional government. In short, the people of the country have many opinions and criticisms on the constitutional draft, which can be used as a reference for the drafting of the legislation in the future, so that it can be submitted to the National Assembly next year for decision. After speaking, the meeting adjourned at 9:00 am. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

Finally, he hoped for four points: (1) Be able to automatically find things to do within the scope of your duties, without waiting for the supervision of superiors. (2) Get rid of all bad habits. (3) Maintain the spirit of hard work that has been made in the past year and continue to progress upwards. (4) Implement the New Life Movement to serve as a model for soldiers in North China and a model for the people of the whole country. At all times and in all things, we must have a competitive spirit, and then knowledge will progress, careers will be successful, and the revival of the country and the nation will be hopeful. The speech lasted about an hour. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Peiping) The murderers of the American missionary tragedy had no clues as of the 18th. Yu Xuezhong, because the case was of great importance, sent Li Qingbo to lead the investigation. After the Ying case occurred, the Peiping Municipal Government reported the situation to President Wang and Chairman Huang. Huang sent a telegram to Peiping yesterday, saying, "I have received the telegram. Please ask Chairman Yu to forward it to Wanping County to cooperate with the municipal government in strict arrest." He Jialuan, the chief of staff of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, told reporters on the 18th that our department regretted the American missionary tragedy due to the thinness of our troops. After American Ambassador Johnson notified the situation by phone at noon on the 15th, he immediately replied that he was responsible for the arrest and immediately summoned Ma Yulin, the captain of the investigation team, and Yu Jinhe, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to urgently discuss the matter. He also ordered a certain regiment of Miao Zhengliu's department stationed in the western suburbs to cooperate in the handling of the case, and strictly ordered Wan Yi, the county magistrate of Wanping County, to strictly arrest the suspects, but there are still no clues as of now. It is now planned to conduct a census in the Shijingshan area. Fortunately, the investigation team has always been very quick in handling cases, and it is expected that it will be solved in the shortest time. Also, according to a certain foreigner, after the Ying case occurred, the American ambassador had telegraphed the government to report it, but the nature of this matter did not have a political effect and would never have an international impact. If there are any parties who donate funeral gifts to Ying, they will be handed over to the Union Church for the Luhe Public School Fund. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The European Situation After the German-Italian Compromise</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power, German diplomacy has been in a state of isolation. Although England occasionally offers words of appeasement, in reality it merely mediates between France and Germany, acting as a peacemaker. England is not a purely European nation, and its considerations are multifaceted, making it difficult to expect immediate and substantial assistance. As for France, the rise of Hitler has given it ample reason to act, and it has taken advantage of the international situation to place Hitler under a broad encirclement of its national power. Other thorny issues, such as the Austrian situation and the soaring influence of Russia, also add to Hitler's predicament. This is why he embarked on a trip to Italy.</p>
<p>During the meeting between the two powers of Italy and Germany, attendants were excluded and security was tight. Outsiders find it difficult to ascertain the truth. However, recent telegrams suggest that the main points were as follows: (1) From now on, the two countries will adopt a consultative policy on international issues. (2) Germany recognizes Austria's independence, on the condition that Italy recognizes Germany's equality in armaments. (3) The two countries will cooperate economically with the countries of the Danube. From these points, it can be inferred that although Italy and Germany have not yet signed any agreement, a new era will begin in both political and economic spheres. There is no doubt about this. It can also be said that the result is an expansion of the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian group into an Italian-German-Austrian-Hungarian group. This is because the purpose of the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian agreement is also political and economic cooperation, which is exactly the same as the recent meeting between the two powers of Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>From an economic standpoint, the benefits of cooperation between Italy and Germany far outweigh those of cooperation between Italy, Austria, and Hungary. Based on past trade figures for these four countries, trade between Italy and Austria-Hungary is far less than that between Italy and Germany. Therefore, the union of Italy, Austria, and Hungary is more politically oriented, while the union of Italy and Germany places equal emphasis on politics and economics. Furthermore, Germany has always been the leading country in Austria-Hungary's foreign trade. Therefore, if Germany can truly join the group of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, it will be able to complement each other economically. Germany and Austria-Hungary were once allied countries, and even Italy had historical ties with them before the European War. Now, due to the needs of the times, they are cooperating again, which is a very natural move. The territories of the four countries are adjacent to each other, and their voices are interconnected. Once war breaks out, their position will be far superior to that of the French group. This will strengthen the power of Italy and Germany, which is certainly something Italy desires.</p>
<p>As such, the recent compromise between Italy and Germany has a significant impact on the future of the European situation. In short, it effectively counteracts the union of Russia and France. This is the first diplomatic victory for Hitler since he came to power in Germany. After returning to Germany, Hitler will also visit Poland, with his intention clearly directed against Russia. However, it is doubtful whether he will succeed. Hitler seems to believe that if Germany invades Russia, it will gain England's tacit approval, and if France comes to Russia's aid, Italy will be able to hold it back. Therefore, developing along this path will encounter fewer obstacles. After the matter is accomplished, Germany can then slowly plot against France with its increased power, which will be to its advantage. However, in our opinion, although the cooperation between Italy and Germany can reduce the function of the union between France and Russia, it is difficult to say that Germany can freely act against Russia at this point. This is because although the current cooperation between Italy and Germany can strengthen the anti-French and anti-Russian forces in Europe, it can also strengthen the union between France and Russia. The relationship between England and France will become more harmonious. England has repeatedly helped Germany to suppress France because Germany was weak and France was strong. After Italy and Germany join hands, France's power will be reduced, and England's objective will have been partially achieved. Its apprehension of France will naturally fade. Furthermore, Italy is a Mediterranean country, and if its national power becomes too strong, or even surpasses France, it will not be in England's interest. In order to maintain its passage to India, England will not allow a country in the Mediterranean to become too strong. Italy's current expansion of its navy is being watched closely by England because of this. Therefore, for England's sake, it is beneficial to maintain the balance of power between France and Italy in the Mediterranean and not to allow Italy's strength to become too strong.</p>
<p>In short, the successful alliance between Italy and Germany marks the emergence of a new balance of power in Europe. No country will have a chance of victory if it rashly starts a war. Therefore, the result will be an even more spectacular display of intrigue and confrontation, awaiting the arrival of the final explosion.</p>

<h3>Bandit Leader Zhu De to Die Soon - Bandit Situation Reported by Surrendered Bandit Soldiers</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Longgang Special Report: The Sixth Route Army advanced south from Longgang on the 7th of this month and occupied the areas of Xia Zhang, Bogongnao, and Taiping on the same day. On the 8th, they continued to advance and encountered a portion of the pseudo-13th Army Corps and the pseudo-Guard Division and pseudo-23rd Division, totaling approximately 8,000 bandits, near Yinlongxia and Tieluxia, about 40 li from Longgang. The bandits stubbornly resisted, occupying dangerous terrain. After five hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated and routed. In this battle, 15 bandit forts on high ground were captured, and over 1,000 bandits were killed or wounded. More than 200 rifles and machine guns were seized. Currently, the Route Army is actively repairing roads and building pillboxes, and expediting local rehabilitation. In recent days, bandit officers and soldiers have been surrendering with their weapons. According to the actual situation reported by the surrenderers, as recorded below: (1) Each bandit company has only two platoons, with 45 officers and soldiers, and about 30 rifles. Each rifle is only equipped with three to six clips of ammunition. (2) Salt in the bandit areas is extremely scarce. Pseudo-currency can only buy two liang of salt per yuan. (3) The bandit soldiers are all aware of our lenient treatment of those who surrender with their weapons. The number of deserters has been increasing daily, so the morale is extremely low. (4) It is heard that bandit leader Mao Zedong has indeed been killed in action. Zhu De is now suffering from neurasthenia and must take one liang of Korean ginseng daily. He is likely to die from his illness. (5) Cash in the bandit areas is completely exhausted. The price of pseudo-currency has plummeted. 25 yuan is only worth one silver dollar. One yuan of pseudo-currency can buy half a jin of lard, and one silver dollar can buy 12.5 jin. (6) There are no able-bodied men in the bandit areas. They are now forcing adult women to serve as bandits. However, men and women are fleeing en masse. Some are using herbal medicines to ulcerate their legs in order to feign lameness and escape. Observing the various realities of the bandit situation, it can be known that they are bound to disintegrate and be wiped out soon. (Datoong News Agency, June 16th)</p>

<h3>Cuba Party Strife Leads to Bloodshed: Ten Dead, Fifty Wounded</h3>
<p>Havana - Cuban political parties clashed with each other on the streets daily, almost turning them into battlefields. The fighting lasted two hours before subsiding, resulting in ten deaths and fifty injuries. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Havana - Another bloody tragedy occurred in Havana today. Three young men used machine guns to fire upon a pro-government march, killing seven. The three young men also suffered cruel retribution. The details are as follows: Sixty members of the ABC group marched in formation through the streets, expressing support for President Mendieta and congratulating him on escaping danger. At this moment, three young men suddenly appeared in a car and strafed the march with machine guns. Four men and three women in the march were hit and fell to the ground, while other pedestrians with lighter injuries scattered and fled to avoid the ruthless bullets. The sound of screams was unbearable to hear. However, the marchers were not afraid and attacked the car carrying the three young men. Several people jumped onto the car, and the perpetrators surrendered. The marchers then resorted to cruel methods, using matches to ignite gasoline in the tank, burning the three men to death inside the car. In the past twenty-four hours, a total of nine men and three women have died due to terrorist activities. It is said that the three men burned to death were followers of former President Machado. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Havana - Yesterday, this area was in a state of terror throughout the day, with people feeling uneasy, fearing tragedy would occur at night. The ABC Party held a mass meeting that day, and the leftists tried to obstruct it from early morning, but to no avail. About fifteen to twenty thousand people participated in the ABC Party's meeting. Although the leftists attacked four times, the ABC Party's demonstration proceeded peacefully. The labor union had previously issued an order for all transportation workers to strike, preventing people from participating in the ABC Party meeting, but only a few taxis complied with the strike order. One of the most dangerous scenes yesterday was when a leftist crowd fired machine guns at a tram and pushed the vehicle off the tracks down a slope. The driver was forced out of the car, and the tram crashed through the front of a dye shop. On the ABC Party's side, they set fire to a vehicle carrying communists to the police station. By 5 p.m., it was reported that seven people were dead and forty-eight were seriously injured, including several women. Another report stated that approximately twelve people had died or were critically injured. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Havana - Finance Minister Sáenz, a leader of the ABC faction, narrowly escaped death during the shooting by rioters yesterday. As Sáenz was traveling in a car, another car suddenly appeared from the side of the road and fired at Sáenz's vehicle. Sáenz ordered his entourage to lie down on the sidewalk to avoid the oncoming car, while Sáenz himself engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. The thugs in the other car also fired at the crowd, but were quickly overwhelmed by the crowd. Yesterday, the ABC Party held a demonstration, and the followers of former President Samartín also demonstrated in opposition, leading to disturbances in several parts of the capital. In total, thirteen people died and more than fifty were injured in yesterday's unrest. However, the actual number of injuries is difficult to determine, as many people sought treatment at private hospitals after being injured. It is said that a certain far-left leader, known for his animosity towards the ABC Party, has been seriously injured. Several injured people have been arrested for participating in the attack on the ABC Party. However, most of the victims were members of the ABC Party. The atmosphere in the capital has not yet returned to calm, as there are fears that the ABC Party will also attack trams in retaliation. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Empty Gold Reserves</h3>
<p>(Berlin) - Due to payments of Young Loan interest and the costs of population and essential goods, the Deutsche Bank's cash and foreign currency reserves decreased by twenty million marks last week. Today, its gold reserve has fallen to 2.9%, which is quite alarming. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Close Relations Between Italy and Germany: Not Aimed at France, Mussolini - A Pragmatist, Hitler - A Dreamer</h3>
<p>Rome - It was firmly stated here today that the result of the meeting between the Italian and German heads of government in Venice is that the relationship between the two countries is indeed becoming closer, but this should not be seen as aiming to oppose France. The goal is actually to seek the minimum level of harmony in European politics. According to the Messaggero newspaper, all proposed solutions to the Austrian problem, from German-Austrian unification to restoration, have been proven impossible. The Venice meeting has demonstrated the great difference in the characters of the two dictators. Mussolini is pragmatic and determined to work hard, while Hitler is a dreamer who often contemplates the vastness of space. The conversations between the two leaders were conducted in German, with no one else present, so it is not surprising that their interpretations of the agreements reached differ. The Italians say that Germany will now stop supporting the Nazi movement in Austria, while German sources claim that this is conditional, and that recognition of the Austrian Nazi movement, although not specifically stipulated, must be included. Hitler has returned to Berlin today after a brief rest in his hometown of Bavaria, while Mussolini is still staying in Riccione. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech: Criticizes Entente Policies, First Statement After Venice Meeting</h3>
<p>(Berlin) - Last night, Chancellor Hitler gave a speech somewhere, strongly criticizing the tendency of the powers to form alliances. This was Hitler's first speech after returning from the important meeting with Mussolini in Venice. His words were actually aimed at the Franco-Russian alliance plan. Hitler declared, "The more the world promotes entente policies, the more necessary it is for us to maintain our power. We have not formed any alliances with other nations, but we must pay attention to ensure that these alliances do not shake Germany's position. Some may ask, if the National Socialist Party demands equality for Germany, then we must implement armaments. We answer that, as far as we are concerned, this can be done, because we have no intention of attacking others. We only want to strengthen ourselves to a certain extent, so that other countries can abandon their ambitions to invade us. We are still too busy dealing with domestic affairs, and other nations should also focus on domestic reforms. If politicians in various countries can devote some of their energy that they use to deal with foreign affairs to domestic reforms, then the world will definitely improve significantly." (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) - Today, on his way back to Berlin, German President Hitler gave a speech in Gera, briefly stating that we harbor no conspiracies against other countries, and we believe that others' conspiracies cannot destroy Germany. The voluntary unity of the whole country is more powerful than cannons and tanks. Although we deeply love peace and Germany does not want war, I will do my best to defend Germany's freedom and honor. Germany has done many possible things to achieve world peace. We not only teach the people to defend themselves, but also show them how to protect the rights of others. Leaders of other countries have also expressed this spirit. This was the German Chancellor's first speech after the Venice meeting. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Gera - The local National Socialist Party held a congress, and Chancellor Hitler rushed to participate and delivered a speech, saying that Germany has felt its own strength. He said, "Foreigners ask what Germany wants. We will answer that, whether domestically or abroad, Germany only seeks non-interference from others. If someone asks me what I will do to seek world peace, I will answer that we will train seventy million people to respect themselves and the rights of others. We have done our best. We only hope that the authorities of other countries can also make their people respect Germany's right to exist. We National Socialists have great plans to be implemented internally, so we have an obligation to seek peace and friendship with all countries. We must also ensure that other countries do not interfere in Germany. Newspapers in various countries should provide assistance to the maintenance of world peace and should not allow elements that are contrary to peace to exploit them." Hitler also said, "For those who can recall the mistakes of the European War and sincerely hope for the reconciliation of all nations," Germany hopes for their success, "Those who only provoke internationally and do not want to be on the battlefield when war breaks out" are opposed by Germany. When talking about the right to equality in armaments, Hitler said, "Germany's right to exist will never be allowed to be questioned. Some say that if Germany wants equality in armaments, then other countries should expand their armaments even more. We will answer that they can do so, because our purpose is only to have sufficient strength to prevent others from attacking Germany. Germany's ambition is not to attack others. I can guarantee to the whole world that Germany has an absolute desire to maintain peace and no intention of war. Therefore, in reality, our actions are only to protect the freedom and honor of the German nation." During Hitler's speech, cheers were incessant, followed by celebratory artillery fire and a parade of National Socialist Party members. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) - The Izvestia newspaper, in an article on the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in Venice, pointed out that Hitler could not avoid negotiations on the Austrian issue, and that the two countries had definite and directly opposed views on this issue. Of these two intersecting views, only one can be imagined as a "compromise," which is that Germany must at least temporarily suspend its special activities in Austria. However, this "compromise" is equivalent to another defeat for fascist Germany on the international stage. The Daily News reported that Italy is willing to approve Germany's return to the League of Nations on the condition of maintaining the League's credibility. If this is true, even if Germany's current government is sincerely following this, this price cannot be equated to the concessions that Germany has made on a fundamental issue of its foreign policy.

<h3>Direct Franco-German Negotiations: Hitler's Special Envoy Visits French Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>(Paris) - According to information obtained today, Ribbentrop, German Chancellor Hitler's special envoy for disarmament, secretly came to Paris during German Chancellor Hitler's meeting with the Italian Prime Minister in Venice and explained to French Foreign Minister Barthou Germany's demands on armaments in detail. Barthou replied that Germany must first re-enter the League of Nations and restore Germany's position in the disarmament conference, and then France can fairly study Germany's demands. It is heard that the French Foreign Minister has received an invitation from British Prime Minister MacDonald and will visit London on July 9th and 10th. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - The Paris Echo newspaper today published an article on the meeting between German disarmament commissioner von Ribbentrop and French Foreign Minister Barthou, warning Barthou not to be fooled by the Germans and fall into their trap, because Germany's attitude, according to the newspaper, has remained unchanged throughout. After the conversation between von Ribbentrop and Barthou concluded, a semi-official statement was released, stating that the focus of the conversation was the disarmament issue. Von Ribbentrop, as the German Chancellor's representative, repeatedly explained Germany's position on disarmament, and Barthou replied that Germany should rejoin the League of Nations and the disarmament conference, and that Germany's efforts would be treated with a fair attitude.

<h3>Japan Expands Air Force: Army Authorities Keenly Research</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - The army authorities are now rushing to create a plan to expand the air force. Previously, because the 65th parliament passed rural relief, the navy's second replenishment plan budget could not realize this plan. However, the current situation is that the expansion and strengthening of the air force is a necessary and urgent matter. The Ministry of the Army has decided to include the expenses required for this plan in the next year's budget, submit it to the parliament, and request its passage. (Domei, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The air force expansion plan, which is the core of the next year's army budget, is currently under keen research by the authorities and has not yet been completed. Since the expansion of the air force is the most important thing for future national defense, the history of the European War, where the air force was most active, is used as an important reference material. In the early stages of the European War, the average number of aircraft in the army of one country in Britain, France and Germany was 233, and the average number of aircraft in one country at the end of the war was 8,500. The loss rate per month was 20% to 30%. Currently, the average number of aircraft owned by the five countries of Britain, the United States, France, Italy and Russia is 2,400, which is about 36 times the average number of aircraft in the early stages of the European War. If a war breaks out in the future, the development of the air force is estimated to follow the same course as the European War. Then, at the end of the future war, the average number of aircraft in one country should reach as many as 86,000. The total average for the early and late stages of the future war should be 43,000. Based on this, if the loss rate is estimated to be 25%, then at least 10,000 aircraft must be replenished every month. This is naturally just a very passive estimate. Because in the early stages of the European War, the power of aircraft was still in doubt, but this is not the case today, and its capabilities have been fully recognized. Therefore, the future war cannot be determined to follow the course of the European War at that time. Therefore, in today's very urgent situation, the expansion of the air force must be on a large scale, and the average number of pilots must be at least 43,000, and the loss of 10,000 people per month must be calculated. Therefore, the air force expansion plan must have the following three points as the main points, namely (1) the increase in the number of aircraft owned, (2) the enrichment of aircraft manufacturing facilities and materials, and (3) the enrichment of pilots. (Dentsu, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The second line of national defense in future wars is now becoming more important, and the air force is particularly important. The final decision of the air force is mostly controlled by the situation of the civilian aviation industry. This is the unanimous opinion of the authorities. If we look at the number of civilian aviation pilots from the current situation of various countries,</p>
<p>United States 18,594, United Kingdom 2,766, France 1,100, Germany 2,500, all have an advantage. Japan had only 391 in 1932. Not only in terms of pilots, but also in terms of the ability to manufacture aircraft, Japan is the worst. If this situation continues, no matter how much the air force is strengthened, it will be difficult to expect the completion of Japan's air defense, so the army is now paying close attention to the improvement of civilian aviation power.

<h3>Initial Anglo-American Naval Talks: Great Difference of Opinion Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>(London) - British and American politicians held the first preparatory meeting for the 1935 naval disarmament conference at 10 Downing Street this morning. Today's meeting lasted one hour and forty-five minutes, and many important issues were reviewed, but no resolutions were announced. The British delegation was led by Prime Minister MacDonald, and the American delegation was led by Special Envoy Davis. It is heard that the British and American opinions on naval issues differ greatly, so further talks will be held in the future. The issue of complete disarmament may not be discussed, but the two delegations hope to resolve the date and location of the formal meeting, as well as whether other smaller naval countries should be invited to participate in addition to the five major powers of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States. The 1935 naval conference is a world conference compared to previous naval conferences. It is said that Japan opposes the participation of small countries in the conference, fearing that they will take a united front to oppose Japan's demand for equality with the British and American navies. The results of the talks between British and American politicians may determine whether the 1935 conference should discuss political issues in the Far East. According to informal but reliable sources in Tokyo, they oppose this discussion. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - In order to cope with the current international situation, Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to establish a major diplomatic policy.

<h3>US Labor Strike Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>San Francisco - The striking workers have refused to accept the compromise reached by their representatives on Saturday and Sunday, so the labor strike that has been hindering Pacific shipping since May 9th seems to be extended indefinitely. This morning, the International Longshoremen's Association branches in Bertron and San Francisco voted to overturn the compromise signed by Bean and Coxeo. This afternoon, two more International Longshoremen's Association branches passed resolutions rejecting the solution to the labor strike. The Longshoremen's Association in Seattle will also discuss this matter on Monday. According to those familiar with the labor strike, the employers plan to use force to ship goods. The Waterfront Employers Association announced tonight that it will open the port on Sunday, because the labor strike has ended after Bean accepted the compromise and the Longshoremen's Association branches have no right to refuse. The workers are not intimidated by the employers' threats and are clearly united tonight, demanding unconditional recognition of the union. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>International Labor Conference: Invites the US to Join the International Labor Office</h3>
<p>(Geneva) - The International Labor Conference unanimously passed a resolution today inviting the United States to join the International Labor Office.

<h3>Dumping of Japanese Goods in South America</h3>
<p>Colon, Panama - A large number of Japanese cotton fabrics have been imported into the British West Indies island of Jamaica in recent years. However, since the recent British Empire adopted trade restrictions, Japanese goods can no longer be transported to the ports of Jamaica. Japanese cargo ships that used to carry cotton fabrics to Jamaica have now changed their routes to Venezuela and Colombia, because Japanese goods are selling well in these two countries.

<h3>Yokohama: Mitsubishi Warehouse Fire Causes 1.2 Million Yen in Damage</h3>
<p>Yokohama - At 10 p.m. last night, a fire broke out in the No. 1 warehouse of the Yokohama Mitsubishi Company branch. Because the warehouse was full of cotton, the fire was very fierce, and flames quickly filled the inside of the warehouse. Fire brigades from all over Yokohama rushed to extinguish the fire, and the warehouse was completely destroyed until 11 p.m. The damage was estimated at more than 6,000 bales of cotton, worth over 1.2 million yen. The cause seems to be a short circuit. (Domei, 18th)</p>
<h3>Pre-World War I: Anglo-French Naval Secret Agreement Incident</h3>
<p>(Paris) - American famous comic newspaper owner Hearst was expelled by the French authorities in 1930. According to news published today by the Paris edition of the New York Guide, the French government has now cancelled the previous order and allowed Hearst to revisit France. The French government's order has been sent to Hearst, as Hearst is currently traveling in Spain. However, it is not yet known whether Hearst will take this opportunity to revisit France. The incident of Hearst being expelled by the French government occurred in September 1930. At that time, Hearst was in Paris, and Holland, the Paris reporter for the New York American newspaper, found the original text of the Anglo-French naval secret agreement and discussed it with Hearst. Hearst immediately published the secret agreement in his comic newspapers. The French Théodore Steeg cabinet considered it inaccurate and immediately arrested and deported Holland, and Hearst was also among those who were deported. However, Holland claimed that the original text of the secret agreement was obtained from an official of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the official was subsequently dismissed.

<h3>Communist Professor Missing</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - William Bickerton, a former English professor at the First Higher School, has been detained by the Metropolitan Police Department on suspicion of involvement in a communist private trial incident. It is now learned that he was the first foreigner involved in the Japanese Communist Party incident. He established contact with overseas red elements and donated hundreds of yen to the party. When he took a vacation and returned home last April, he did not return to his hometown of New Zealand, but went to Moscow, bringing back to the Japanese Communist Party hard-to-obtain publications such as the International Communist Party's organ. Now the investigation has basically ended, so he was allowed to be released on bail earlier this month and returned to his home in Chigasaki. Unexpectedly, he suddenly disappeared on the 15th, and his whereabouts are unknown. Although the authorities are actively searching, it is feared that he has fled overseas. (Dentsu, 18th)</p>
<h3>India Agrees to Raise Silver Prices</h3>
<p>(New York) - According to a telegram received here today from Karachi, India is prepared to cooperate with the United States in minting silver coins to raise world silver prices. It is said that the world-renowned currency expert Wheeler told President Roosevelt that India is willing to cooperate with the United States on this matter. Commodity prices in the United States and India are still falling, and Wheeler is said to have told President Roosevelt to take the necessary steps. Silver advocates here unanimously welcomed this report. Wheeler was a member of the Currency Committee in 1921 and 1922. Based on the committee's report, the United Kingdom abolished India's silver standard, closed the mint, and established a gold standard for the rupee. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3>The Saito Cabinet in Stormy Weather - Japanese Dispatch - The Military Doesn't Maintain or Overthrow the Cabinet - It is Feared That Ugaiki's Succession Will Be Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>Japan, which has put up the signboard of constitutionalism and implemented military dictatorship, has become more and more blatant in its recent performance. Originally, after the Kuroda Hideo bribery case was revealed, Takahashi was uneasy about his position as finance minister, and Saito was implicated as a result. However, with the death of Togo, the great naval hero, general news focused on the record of Togo, from his achievements during his lifetime to his posthumous honors, thus shifting the general focus. The overthrow movement itself did not have much power, so it became even more relaxed. The reason why Saito received a fatal blow and continued to maintain his position is, according to his own explanation and that of Finance Minister Takahashi, that they will wait until the truth of the Kuroda case is clarified before submitting their resignations. At present, they still have to hesitate. At the same time, the powerful parties, especially the military, are unwilling to actively support the current cabinet, but they are also unwilling to actively overthrow it. The two major established political parties are also lifeless. Because they have no interest in it and cannot obtain the position of prime minister, they are not very enthusiastic about overthrowing the cabinet.</p>
<p>However, the collapse of the Saito cabinet is already an inevitable fact, formed by the objective situation. What is lacking is subjective promotion. After Saito resigns, the person with the highest voice to succeed him is currently the Governor-General of Korea, Ugaiki Kazushige. Moreover, after the Kuroda incident, the Minseito Party sent three people to Korea, ostensibly to inspect the Korean rice market and production situation, and how to coordinate with rice production in the Japanese mainland in the future. In reality, they went to discuss with Ugaiki the issue of succeeding the cabinet and welcome him to Tokyo to contact all parties. Although the Minseito Party has denied this matter, the fact is that it is not accidental. In addition to the Minseito Party, there is also the faction led by Tokonami Takejiro in the Seiyukai Party, and the faction of Kuhara Fusanosuke, which is the so-called coalition faction of the two parties. If Ugaiki forms a cabinet, its foundation will be in the Minseito Party and the Tokonami-Kuhara factions of the Seiyukai Party. If this becomes a reality, the Seiyukai Party will probably split, which is what the Seiyukai Party executives are trying to prevent.</p>
<p>As for those who oppose Ugaiki's rise to power, the most important are the military. The reason for their opposition, according to general public opinion, is that the middle-level cadres of the army are dissatisfied with Ugaiki's gradualist policy, especially his closeness to political parties. They fear that after Ugaiki comes to power, he will support the development of the zaibatsu, so that the army's aggressive policy cannot be thoroughly implemented. In fact, this is just one of many reasons. Internally, there are various opposing forces. Ugaiki is the head of the army's administrative faction. In the past, when he was Minister of the Army, he sacrificed many junior and middle-level cadres in the name of army reorganization. These people now belong to the Araki faction, so they hold deep resentment and strong antipathy. At this time, Ugaiki's rise to power will not necessarily strongly propose a plan to reorganize the army, but the Araki faction still refuses to express its support for him. This is conceivable.</p>
<p>The navy has no ill feelings towards Ugaiki, and some young officers have expressed goodwill. The current Naval Minister Osumi also has some sympathy for him, so Rear Admiral Sakano Tsuneyoshi, chairman of the Navy's Popularization Committee, issued a separate statement saying, "The navy does not oppose the Ugaiki cabinet." This matter, when Ugaiki went to Tokyo, can be said to have added a lot of luster to Ugaiki personally, but it has caused trouble instead. First, the leading figures of the navy, such as the naval minister and the chief of the naval general staff, did not know about this matter beforehand.</p>
<p>They tacitly approved of Ugaiki's formation of a cabinet in their consciousness, but they had not explicitly stated it. Such a statement aroused the displeasure of the army. Second, Sakano's statement showed the differences in opinion between the army and the navy, which further aroused suspicion in society. Therefore, the navy department ordered the removal of Sakano from his position as chairman of the Popularization Committee, in order to express the navy's opinion on the selection of the next cabinet member. Therefore, Ugaiki's rise to power has encountered special obstacles.</p>
<p>As for the change of the Japanese cabinet, no matter who the successor is, whether it is Ugaiki, Kiyoura, or Saito being re-appointed, the overall situation will still be subject to the military, fully expressing the color of fascism. Its foreign relations, especially its relations with China, will not only carry out aggression according to the planned plan, but also look westward after the success of the Jehol Railway, and create new facts and provoke other incidents to intensify its so-called emergency situation and help.</p>
<p>The military will increase its power to control the cabinet, so no matter who succeeds the cabinet, it will still be a puppet of the military. (June 13th, Tokyo)</p>

When the camels saw it from afar, they actually returned to the market on their own and lay down to eat the fodder bags, which was also strange. At the beginning of the journey, licorice grew all over the fields. Diggers could get 30 catties a day, which could be sold for 4 jiao. There was a spring flowing along the road, and the banks were covered with alkali, as white as powder. There were two or three willows on the left side of the road, the only tall trees seen in the past two days. Crows and sparrows built nests on them, as dense as spring orchids in a bunch. After passing several sand ridges, there was no grass or trees, the color was white and the surface was flat, like a group of naked women lying down. Looking closer, the insect tracks and ripples were woven like brocade, undulating and stretching, with thousands of shapes. The camel team walked slowly, resembling a swimming dragon. After walking more than 30 li on the ridges, some camel drivers were entangled by the sleeping devil, so they hugged their dogs and snored on the sand surface. When the camel bells were far away and inaudible, the dogs would get up and chase, and the people would also wake up in surprise. Below the ridge, we crossed a shallow river, with green grass like a carpet on both banks and sand ridges surrounding it, forming a natural barrier. Fearing that there would be no water source if we continued, we camped by the stream. That day's journey was only 50 li. We washed our feet in the stream under the moonlight. Suddenly, a flock of water birds flew up with a cackle. I couldn't tell if they were wild ducks.</p>
<p>On the 26th, the morning sun entered the tent. We got up and saw a flock of more than 200 sheep grazing on the green grass, docile and lovely. The shepherd girl was already of marriageable age, wearing a fur coat and braids. She behaved generously. According to her, "My name is Bai Danu, and I originally came from inside the pass. Three years ago, I came here with my relatives and rented a qing of land from the Tartars (commonly known as Mongolians) to plant millet for one season. I harvested more than 40 shi, and the rent of 10,000 wen has already been paid in advance. Now my father is dead and my mother is alive. I am herding sheep for others for 20 yuan a year to make a living." When asked about the situation of sheep herding and production, she replied, "There are 200 sheep. They are sheared twice a year, worth about 40 yuan. Ewes give birth three times a year, each time giving birth to two or three goat kids and one or two lambs. About 100 large sheep can be sold each year, worth about 300 yuan." After the conversation, I gave her a cake, which she accepted with a smile. Then she untied her food bag and poured out fried corn kernels to repay me. Chewing each grain was like eating fragrant beans. After lunch, we formed a team and set off from the stream. Suddenly, there was a heavy rain. It came quickly and cleared quickly. Although the ground was wet, it was not deep. The camels walked and their hooves lifted, and we could see the dry sand immediately. The cross-section of the sand ridge was four or five zhang high and layered. The upper layers were white sand, the middle layers were mixed with gravel and slightly red, and the bottom layers were dark yellow and firmly bonded. It was thought to be alluvial material from ancient times, and it could be used to measure the Yellow River at that time. The color must have been truly yellow, and not as crimson as it is today. Leaving the river and climbing the ridge, although it was still sandy land, wormwood, horsetail, and shepherd's purse grew everywhere. There were many rat holes near the roots, and they were breeding luxuriantly. The 20-li ridge ended on flat ground. Seven or eight broken houses were scattered in various places, and the nearby land had been cultivated. Cellars were dug in the corners of the land to store grain. A woman was driving away sheep that were eating the grass on the cover. Her feet were small and her clothes were short, so it was expected that the villagers were Han Chinese.</p>
<p>After passing a village, we passed a trench, only one zhang and five chi wide, and twice as deep. The cross-section was all yellow clay, far from comparable to the condensed sand in the east of the ridge. The camel team turned around, shaped like a flattened "Z". The head of the team had already reached the other side, the middle of the team was still in the trench, and the tail of the team was still dragging on this side. Zhou Jun, the wheel driver, took the opportunity to pass out cakes, throwing them up and catching them down, which was convenient and interesting. After the whole team had passed, more than 100 camels came towards us, fully loaded with wool. They stood aside to make way. Continuing southwest, weeds spread endlessly and were boundless. The soil was very good and could be cultivated. We passed five or six intersections, with overlapping footprints. It was expected that there were villages, but we couldn't see them. At 9 o'clock, we arrived at Da Jing (Big Well) and camped on the beach, traveling 60 li. The well was circular and made of stone, about 7 chi in diameter and less than one zhang deep, and we could get clear water. Stone troughs and willow buckets were placed next to it for the camels to drink. About a li away from the well, there was a village named Da Jing. The Mongolian cavalryman An Baozi asked the camel drivers for flour in the evening and stayed overnight in the village.</p>
<p>At 4 a.m. on the 24th, I was awakened from my sleep by a loud thunder. I put on my clothes and went out of the tent. Dark clouds covered the sky and the slanting moon was dim. I hurriedly moved the boxes and things, shoveled sand to pile up and press down the tent leaves. The heavy rain poured down in the midst of thunder and lightning. It was difficult to continue the old dream, so I sat and waited for dawn. Another team had three guests who had not prepared a tent because they had few companions. They began to flee here, and their clothes were soaked. By noon, the rain had not yet cleared. The dung was wet and could not be used to make a fire, so I went to the village to bake cakes. I entered a "Ma Yingchang's Small Shop". Ma was curled up smoking, looking gaunt and old, and his clothes and fur were dirty, which made people unable to approach him. According to him, he was a Mongolian named Ma Shiyin. He had served as the fourth battalion commander of the cavalry regiment of the Darlat Banner and the captain of the road protection security team. He had been in the army for more than 30 years without fighting a single battle. The organization was quite similar to a formal army, but the monthly salary was very small. Each soldier received two yuan a month, a squad leader three yuan, a ten-man leader four yuan, a platoon leader six yuan, and even the battalion commander only twelve yuan. However, the foreign money obtained from chasing bandits and the rewards obtained from protecting the road were not turned over and could be divided equally. The current battalion commander is Seng Galin Ying, with 300 soldiers, and the methods are still the same as the old regulations.</p>
<p>An old man was sitting in the corner of the kang. He was over 80 years old, with five generations living together, totaling more than 30 people. He was originally from Qin Province and had been farming here for more than 50 years. His sons and grandchildren had gone to Wuyuan (400 li away from here) to rent land to farm. They had just returned from escaping donations. The old man told about the agricultural situation in the two places as follows: "The sovereignty of the grassland originally belonged to the Mongols. People (also called farmers) who come here to farm must rent land from the prince. The area of the rented land is not measured in qing or mu, but is marked by the land objects. For example, the east is from that mountain ridge (that is, the mountain ridge), the west is to this bump, the south is from that trap ditch, and the north reaches this short tree. The cultivated land within several hundred li nearby is first owned by large landowners, who directly register large plots with the Dara (banner) prince, not knowing how many qing or mu there are. They only state that the annual rent is so many thousand wen. Then the farmers sublet from the large landowners and pay rent according to the land area, the same as before. However, in recent years, disasters have occurred frequently in Shanxi and Shaanxi, and more and more refugees have fled here to rent land. The large landowners took the opportunity to increase the rent, changing from thousand to yuan (previously the rent was about ten thousand wen, but now it is changed to ten yuan). In addition to collecting the total rent from the large landowners, the Dara prince also sends Mongolian soldiers to directly collect food and fodder from the farmers, collecting five sheng of grain and 50 catties of grass per yuan of land (paying one yuan of rent is called one yuan of land, and so on). If you herd 100 sheep, you pay three yuan for water and grass in the spring and send two sheep to reward them in the autumn, all of which are exclusively enjoyed by the prince. After the grassland has been cultivated, planting millet (also known as yellow rice), buckwheat, millet, sesame (for oil), and potatoes (potatoes) can all be produced, but the amount of harvest varies from year to year. If the rainfall is even, it will be a big harvest, otherwise there will be widespread planting but little harvest, or even no harvest at all. 'Relying on the sky for food' is what this means."</p>
<p>The old man's eldest son, who was also gray-haired, said, "Wuyuan's water conservancy and soil fertility are really beyond the reach of other counties, but the donations and taxes are so harsh that they are almost unparalleled in other counties. I have been farming there for more than ten years, and the only deep impression I have is 'one year is worse than the other.' But this does not mean that the land and weather are not as good as before, but that the donations and taxes are becoming more and more harsh, increasing year by year, and the burden on farmers is becoming heavier and heavier. I plant one qing of millet, which can usually harvest about 60 shi. Last year, I just harvested 60 shi, and each shi was sold for 1.8 yuan, earning 108 yuan. This year, in March and April, each shi rose to 16 yuan, but there was no grain to sell. As for the harm we pay (farmers near the river in Wuyuan call donations and taxes 'harm,' such as land harm, slaughter harm, etc.), the land rent is 60 yuan, the county government's expenses are 25 yuan, the prison grain (commonly known as white grain, for prisoners to eat) is 2 shi, worth 3.6 yuan, the military grain is 2 shi and 7 dou, worth 4.86 yuan, the military grass is 5,000 catties, temporarily not counting the price, the county government fee is 3.7 yuan, the district office fee is 2.5 yuan, and the water conservancy bureau's water rent is 16 yuan, totaling 115.66 yuan. Deducting expenses from income, there is a deficit of 7.66 yuan, and the labor, food, seeds, fertilizer, etc. are not included. This spring, during the Sun-Ma war, camels and carts were requisitioned. The camels and horses were killed and eaten, and the carts were burned for warmth. My family lost two horses and one cart. Those who did not have carts and horses were required to pay money and provide laborers, and they suffered no less. In addition, there are livestock harms, with each head of cattle, horse, and camel paying 0.66 yuan a year, donkeys paying 0.33 yuan, and pigs paying slaughter harm, with each head paying 0.55 yuan. Pig bristle harm is 0.46 yuan. Pig bristles are not worth that much money, and the slaughterer jokingly sent it to the donation collector, who refused to accept it and immediately threw it on the ground. Last year, the opium donation in the whole county was planned to collect 90,000 yuan, but due to the disaster, only 60,000 yuan was actually collected. The collection method was that in June and July, the county magistrate, together with the district and village chiefs, inspected the opium seedlings and assessed their quality. The upper land was collected at 12 yuan per mu, the middle land at 8 yuan, the lower land at 4 yuan, and the lower-lower land at 2 yuan. There were many abuses, which cannot be described in a word. Most of the farmers near the river in Wuyuan come from Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. The cultivated land and houses are all rented. They have no permanent property or ancestral tombs. Suffering so much harm, what else can they do but escape?" He sighed incessantly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Surround the Changli County Government - Forcing the County Magistrate to Release Drug Traffickers - Negotiations Intensify, Japanese Consul Arrives in Tangshan</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: The Changli County Government was surrounded by the local Japanese garrison force at 2 p.m. on the 14th, and County Magistrate Liang Yu was insulted. After this incident occurred, it has become a serious diplomatic issue in eastern Luan. Here is a detailed account of the incident:</p>
<p>County Magistrate Liang Yu of Changli used to be the dean of the Faculty of Arts of Northeastern University and was a student who studied in the United States. After becoming the county magistrate of Changli, he was upright and selfless and worked hard to govern. He especially strictly cracked down on the drug dens set up by Japanese and Korean vagrants in the county, and imposed heavy penalties for each case. There was a company of Japanese garrison troops stationed there, under the jurisdiction of Lieutenant Colonel Ochiai, the battalion commander of the Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan. The company commander was Captain Niwada, the platoon leader was Lieutenant Horio, and there was also Abe, the patrol chief of the Changli branch office of the Shanhaiguan Japanese Police Station, and Taki Moto Tomizo, the commander of the military police, all of whom had agencies in the city, colluding with the garrison troops. Whenever the county government cracked a case, they would interfere, either forcibly demanding the release of the prisoners or ordering the return of the赃物. Magistrate Liang insisted on his indomitable spirit and dealt with the Japanese side, so the resentment grew over time. Two months ago, the county arrested a suspect named Wang in a bandit case and a suspect named Li in a drug trafficking case. The Japanese military police commander and the garrison commander came to protest one after another, demanding the release of the persons and goods. Liang said that the arrested persons were all Chinese, and that Chinese officials should not punish Chinese criminals. Wouldn't this be deliberately destroying China's administrative and judicial spirit? Seeing that Liang refused, the Japanese side still used threats and inducements to force Liang to release them, but Liang did not budge. Until recently, the bandit suspect Wang was released after investigation because there was insufficient evidence of his crime. The next day, Japanese garrison commander Niwada held a banquet to invite County Magistrate Liang and the gentry of the whole city, saying it was a celebration. After all the guests had arrived, he suddenly led a person out of the back room, quickly to the head seat, and showed him extreme respect. This person was none other than the bandit suspect Wang. After Wang sat down, the Japanese dragged County Magistrate Liang to sit under Wang's shoulder. County Magistrate Liang knew that they intended to insult him, but he still managed to drink a cup, made an excuse and left the seat to return to the government. Seeing that they had not fully accomplished the insult, the Japanese side sent platoon leader Horio to the county government again that night, demanding the release of the drug trafficking criminal Li. The county magistrate refused, and Horio left angrily. At 2 p.m. on the 14th, Japanese garrison commander Niwada suddenly sent Horio to lead more than 30 soldiers, fully armed, and carrying two machine guns, and rushed into the county, surrounding the various departments in the government. At that time, County Magistrate Liang was working in his office. Horio and the soldiers drove Liang into the room, their voices fierce, and showed him their guns, ordering him to release Li immediately and compensate Li for his losses of 4,900 yuan, otherwise they would shoot Liang to death. Liang argued and refused to yield. The Japanese captain remained barbarous and refused to leave. After a two-hour stalemate, Horio voluntarily changed the conditions, demanding that Li be released within three days and that the stolen money of 1,500 yuan and four packages of opium be returned. If he did not comply, he would come again and kill the county magistrate. After the Japanese soldiers left, County Magistrate Liang hurriedly sent Li Weiting, the chief of the judicial section of the county office, to Tangshan to report to Tao Shangming, the administrative inspector of Luan and Yu, requesting him to negotiate with the Japanese side to stop them. In the afternoon, the section chief went to Shanhaiguan to see Su Yuqi, the chief of the local public security bureau, and asked Su to accompany him to visit Commander Ochiai, requesting him to order the troops to stop their illegal actions. At 1 p.m. on the 15th, Tanaka, the Japanese vice-consul stationed in Tianjin, had arrived in Tangshan and was discussing solutions with Tao Shangming. Because the three-day deadline was tomorrow, if the Japanese garrison troops relied on their barbarity and shot County Magistrate Liang, the situation would escalate. However, by the evening, no order had been issued, and it was not yet decided what to do. Li, who was trafficking drugs, was said by the Changli Japanese garrison to be the troop's bartender (that is, a servant), but according to investigation, he was purely a Chinese traitor raised by the Japanese garrison troops, who trafficked drugs for profit and shared the profits. The future of Changli is very dangerous, and the people are very panicked, fearing that the Japanese army will take illegal actions. (15th)</p>
<h3>Tax Police Corps - Construction of Roads in Zhusha Creek, Thorough Implementation of Cleaning, Resettlement of Refugees</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: According to a dispatch from Zhusha Creek, Zhusha Creek is located between Tengtian and Longgang, surrounded by mountains and lush forests. Clear streams flow through the town. Two miles south is Longgang, where the ancestral tomb of Ouyang Wenzhong of the Song Dynasty is located. The tombstone of Longgang still stands tall. The beauty of the scenery is unimaginable for city dwellers. However, the lack of man-made construction makes it seem somewhat simple. Since the Tax Police Corps was ordered to station here in late April, it has been actively seeking to beautify and improve Zhusha Creek. Therefore, it is building ring roads around the city to facilitate the movement of people, establishing a work and rest bell to encourage diligence, and constructing parks, music pavilions, and sports grounds for people's recreation. All construction projects have been completed in order.</p>
<p>Zhusha Creek has inconvenient transportation, barren land, and poor people. The residents have shallow knowledge and pay little attention to public health. Therefore, an epidemic occurred years ago, killing thousands of people. The Tax Police Corps believes that with the hot summer approaching, it is necessary to carry out a thorough cleaning campaign to prevent disasters. Therefore, it is actively promoting work such as dredging ditches, building public toilets, sweeping garbage, eliminating flies, and inspecting restaurants. After two weeks of rectification, the appearance of the entire town has been completely changed. It is expected that various infectious diseases can be reduced this summer.</p>
<p>The head of the Tax Police Corps, Wen Yingxing, has been working hard on matters such as searching for and suppressing remnants of bandits, defending the local area, resettling the people, and training the team. Therefore, in the past month, the local area has been peaceful, the markets have gradually prospered, and many people have returned from afar. Moreover, groups of hundreds of people have fled back from bandit areas. The corps commander has sent personnel to properly appease them one by one and find locations for them to live in. The bandits are exhausted and isolated, and there are occasional reports of them surrendering with their weapons. Recently, bandits from the fake Western Army and the fake Longgang Guerrilla Team surrendered, each carrying automatic rifles and 7.9mm rifles. Both the political training and military law departments of the corps have jointly interrogated them, awarded them bonuses, and dismissed them. It is said that automatic rifles were awarded 50 yuan and rifles were awarded 20 yuan. According to the bandits, the bandit side has been blockaded and is extremely short of materials. Salt costs three taels per yuan, and there is nowhere to buy it. The bandit army's rifles are only equipped with six bullets, and the Mauser pistols are equipped with three bullets. Now, the lower-level officers and soldiers are all looking for opportunities to escape. Therefore, the time for their annihilation can be expected soon.</p>

<h3>Military Academy's 10th Anniversary - Original Text of Principal Chiang's Address</h3>
<p>The following is the original text of Principal Chiang's address at the Central Military Academy's 10th Anniversary celebration:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, today our academy is holding its 10th anniversary celebration. When we celebrate, we should think about all the hardships and difficulties that we have experienced in the past ten years, especially in the initial establishment. Yesterday, I wrote a paper titled "A Review of the Revolutionary Process in the Past Ten Years," which is about the history of the Chinese revolution in the past ten years, and can also be said to be the history of our academy's revolutionary process. However, many students may not know about the initial difficult creation of our academy. Therefore, on this 10th anniversary, I would like to briefly report to everyone. The establishment of our academy was at the most difficult time of the National Revolution, in an environment surrounded by reactionary troops and all evil forces. At that time, although the Premier was the Grand Marshal, he could not issue an effective order, let alone implement any doctrine as he wished. The revolutionary forces were surrounded and shrouded in the air of counter-revolution and could not move. In the midst of hardship and depression, the Premier painstakingly founded our Whampoa Military Academy to lay the foundation for revolutionary military power and complete the cause of the National Revolution. At the time of its establishment, the site of the Whampoa School was still occupied by other troops. The Premier issued an order to move them, but they ignored it. Later, after repeated hard work and requests, they finally moved out. After they moved out, although we had a piece of clean land in Whampoa as our school site, the school buildings were so simple at that time that many students had personally lived in or seen them. Not only were they not suitable as a military academy, and not as tall and perfect as they are now, but they were not even suitable for a battalion of troops to be stationed in for a long time. However, our Premier could not find a second revolutionary foothold other than Whampoa at that time. Therefore, he used the small and simple place of Whampoa to establish this school. The first class started on this day in 1924 and set off for the Eastern Expedition in December. During these six months, we were constantly surrounded and jealous of by all counter-revolutionary forces. The hardship and difficulty were really unbearable. Now, the general students, officers, and soldiers of our academy have such tall houses to live in and such complete equipment to use. They eat well and dress warmly. All of these were absolutely unattainable when our academy was founded in 1924. What kind of difficulties did the Premier, Party Representative Liao, and other comrades face in establishing our academy at that time? Not to mention that the counter-revolutionary troops were always despising us, jealous of us, and ready to eliminate us at any time, the difficulty of school funding alone caused our academy to suffer immensely. I will only give one example so that everyone can understand. One day, we had exhausted all our efforts and still had not raised enough food. The next day, there was no rice to cook and we were about to run out of food. At that time, we had to go to Guangzhou to find Party Representative Liao, who took out 300 yuan to buy rice, which was transported to Whampoa, and then we had food to eat the next day. How could you general students know about this kind of suffering at that time? From this incident, you can imagine how difficult and arduous the situation of our academy was at that time. However, in this environment, we successfully trained a revolutionary elite army in a short period of six months and laid the foundation for the revolutionary military power. Just think about how hardworking and enduring the general teachers and students were, and how vigilant and courageous they were. We must never forget this in the future when we complete the revolutionary cause. We must always remember the hardships and difficulties that the Premier, Party Representative Liao, and other comrades went through to establish our academy. There is a local saying in Guangdong, "Sneakily." At that time, the Premier, Party Representative Liao, and other comrades really established our academy sneakily in the midst of hunger, hardship, and difficulty. The task of the National Revolution that we will undertake in the future will be even more arduous than in the past ten years. If we want to complete these tasks and fulfill our responsibilities, we must be even more revolutionary than in the past ten years, and we must be even more hardworking, enduring, adventurous, and courageous than in the period of establishing our academy. Most importantly, we must accept the Premier's revolutionary spirit and lay the foundation for the revolution, starting with hard work and endurance. The above is just a description of the initial establishment of our academy from the perspective of the living environment in the first six months. Now, I will talk about the early struggles. When our academy started, there were only 500 students. Except for those who died or were eliminated, only 450 students remained at the time of graduation. Everyone knows that the most important thing for us to establish a military academy to train students is weapons. Where did the rifles for the initial 500 people come from? At that time, the Guangzhou Arsenal had already been controlled by the warlords. Even the Grand Marshal's Office had to beg the warlords to get a rifle. Fortunately, the director of the arsenal at that time was still a member of our revolutionary party. He followed the order of the Grand Marshal and secretly used two or three months of hard work to steal more than 500 rifles for our Whampoa Military Academy. We used these 500 rifles to train student soldiers and fight against all the bad environments and counter-revolutionary forces in all directions. At first, the general officers saw that the Grand Marshal had given these 500 rifles to the Whampoa Military Academy, and thought that they would definitely be confiscated by Chen Jiongming in the future. They thought that our school was useless. However, we used these 500 rifles to continuously fight hard and lay the foundation for the greatest revolutionary military power. At first, the Guangzhou Merchant Corps rebelled and colluded with the imperialists for foreign aid. The imperialists of various countries sent many warships to Guangzhou, which were parked in front of our Whampoa School to threaten us. However, we relied on 500 rifles to fight against these dozens of warships and the bad environment filled with machine guns in all directions. No matter how strong the enemy was, no matter how they threatened us, we always fought unremittingly and still went to drill and class every day, intensifying our training. Those imperialists could not eliminate us. Therefore, all our teachers, students, and comrades, as well as all the generals, must know that we only had 500 rifles at the beginning. How could we lay the foundation for today's revolutionary military power, and then eliminate all the warlords and resist all the imperialists? It was entirely due to the revolutionary spirit taught to us by the Premier, which is also the Whampoa spirit. Now, our school has been established for ten years. Not to mention that more than 20,000 students have graduated from various classes, even the number of officers and students currently in school is more than ten times that of the beginning. All equipment, weapons, etc. are also ten times better than before. However, at this 10th anniversary celebration of our academy and the beginning of the second National Revolution, our current revolutionary environment is still the same as it was ten years ago when the first National Revolution began in Guangdong. In the future, there will definitely be many imperialist warships threatening us, even more threatening than before. However, when we think that our academy had 500 rifles ten years ago and could resist imperialism, now that we have thousands of rifles, what are we afraid of? Is there any imperialist that we cannot resist? All our teachers, students, and generals must have the courage of Whampoa in those years, revolutionary confidence, common vitality, and strive to fight to the death and coexist with Nanjing City to protect our revolutionary capital. Only in this way can we be the Premier's followers and be worthy of being the teachers and students of our academy. Today, our academy is holding its 10th anniversary celebration. When we think about the teachers and students who died in the past ten years, how brave they were to sacrifice for the party, the country, and the doctrine, and when we think about the first National Revolution that our academy's teachers and students completed in the past ten years, eliminating all the warlords in the country, how glorious and great it was. The work of our first National Revolution laid the foundation for a greater second National Revolution. I believe that all the teachers and students of our academy will definitely continue to work hard on this foundation and carry forward the past achievements day by day. However, everyone must know that the second National Revolution is more arduous than the first National Revolution. Therefore, we must be more revolutionary and work harder than before. At this important 10th anniversary celebration, we must make our determination in front of the Premier's statue and under the inspiration of the souls of the martyrs, work hard, be persevering, and never give up. We will live and die with the party and the country, and dedicate our bodies, minds, blood, and lives to the party and the country to realize our Three Principles of the People, create a great career, and build a truly free and equal Republic of China. This is the mission of all the teachers and students of our academy, and it is also a revolutionary determination that every student and every comrade should have when our academy holds its 10th anniversary celebration today."</p>
<h3>Wuyuan and Guangze - Two Counties Assigned to Jiangxi Province - Chiang's Letter to the Executive Yuan for Information</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang recently stated that the terrain of Wuyuan in Anhui and Guangze in Fujian is not well-organized, and military and political facilities are inconvenient. Moreover, the Red bandits can use the distorted terrain as a hiding place. In order to facilitate suppression facilities, the two counties were assigned to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province. In addition to ordering the provincial governments of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Anhui, he also informed President Wang of the Executive Yuan to distribute to various ministries and courtyards for reference. The original letter is as follows: "It is found that the Red bandits are disturbing several provinces, and they always rely on remote places as a haven for rats. Therefore, the military and political affairs of the counties on the borders of each province, which are not well-organized in the situation, are inconvenient, which reduces the efficiency of suppression. Now that the army is winning victory after victory and the bandits are increasingly poor, it is appropriate to wipe them out in one go, and they should not be allowed to use the terrain to survive. This is for the situation in the border counties, and it is necessary to properly arrange them in order to suit the opportunity. Now, due to the special terrain of Guangze County under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province and Wuyuan County under the jurisdiction of Anhui Province, it is necessary to assign them to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province. The reasons and methods are listed separately on the left: (1) Guangze County is very long from southwest to northeast, bordering Licuan, Zixi, Guixi, and Qianshan Counties in Jiangxi Province. Only the southeastern part, shaped like a bowstring, borders Shaowu and Chong'an Counties. From the perspective of the situation, the Guangze area is completely protruding into Jiangxi Province. Now, for the convenience of military construction and political aspects, it has been decided to assign the entire Guangze County to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province in order to maximize efficiency. (2) According to the "Anhui Tongzhi", Wuyuan County belonged to Jiangnan Road in the Tang Dynasty. In the Song Dynasty, it was proposed to change it to Jiangxi Province because it could rely on Maoling and Xinling as the boundary, and the waters south of the mountains all flowed into Jiangxi. Now, it is observed that its terrain protrudes greatly into Jiangxi Province, and it is very scattered in Anhui. The political progress and military planning were very inconvenient in the past, and it is appropriate to change the subordination. It is also decided to assign the entire Wuyuan County to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province in order to facilitate facilities and facilitate suppression. In addition to ordering the governments of Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangxi Provinces to hand over Guangze and Wuyuan Counties according to the original county boundaries and erect obvious and solid boundary markers, two simple maps are to be drawn and sent to your hospital. Please check and order the competent department to make a decision and transfer it to the National Government for inspection and distribution to the departments of the hospital. I hope to see a reply." (17th)</p>
<h3>Recent News on Bandit Suppression in Chaozhou and Meizhou</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The joint bandit suppression between Fujian and Guangdong will soon be seen. Chaozhou and Meizhou are the rear of the Fujian and Guangdong armies after they were dispatched. The local security and pacification are closely related to the military affairs of bandit suppression on the front line. Currently, the upper reaches of the Dongjiang and Hanjiang Rivers are the responsibility of Deng Longguang to suppress bandits. The coastal area of ​​Chaoshan is the responsibility of Zhang Ruigui to defend. Deng also ordered the militia escort teams of Punin, Jieyang, Fengshun, Meixian and Ningwu Hua counties to surround and intercept Gu Dacun's bandits at designated locations. If neighboring districts and townships do not report or intercept bandits passing through the territory, they will be punished as collaborating with bandits. A notice of repentance from Gu Dacun's bandit army was issued: (1) If the bandits can capture Gu Dacun alive or kill him and bring him back, they will be allowed to rehabilitate completely and will be generously rewarded; (2) If they cannot capture or kill the bandit leader, they can surrender with their weapons and will be allowed to rehabilitate. Those who surrender their guns and bullets will be rewarded generously; (3) Those who surrender unarmed and can reveal the bandits' secrets will also be allowed to rehabilitate and will be rewarded appropriately. These printed materials have been distributed to various counties, districts, and townships. Among the rehabilitated communists are Zou Hanshi and others, who are now serving as plainclothes detectives in the bandit suppression army, leading troops to search the mountains, and confirming that Peng Li, a messenger of the Fengshun County Office, was a red bandit communications officer and was related to the assassination of County Chief Lin. Peng was executed by firing squad, and seventeen male and female bandits were captured in Datangdu, Tongziyang. The bandits in Fengshun have been hiding in the mountains of Wuhua Zijing due to strict searches. Therefore, the upper reaches of the Hanjiang River can be slightly prosperous.</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Red bandits originally gathered in the following mountains: (1) Nan Shan, the junction of Chaoyang, Punin, and Huilai. The Red bandits here have been completely suppressed after more than a year of encirclement and suppression by Zhang's division. Chen Yaoshu's regiment of the division is currently handling the aftermath. Recently, the household registration of each district and township in the vicinity has been re-adjusted, ten families have been jointly guaranteed, and armed roll call has been strictly implemented. If the number of people called out in each district and township has not been reported to the township head, they will be treated as bandits and executed on the spot. Since last month, the processing has been very strict and has been very effective. More than ten bandits have been captured one after another and executed on the spot. Chen Tuan ordered Punin, which is located in the commanding height of Nan Shan and Bei Shan, to build blockhouses and telephones as soon as possible to prevent bandits. (2) Bei Shan, the junction of Jieyang, Chaoyang, and Punin. Bandits have recently been active here. On the evening of the 7th, more than 100 bandits suddenly appeared in Dayuanbu Chizhuling, Guanbu District, armed with sharp guns and cannons and flashlights. They cut off the telephone lines directly connected to the county government and the East District Pacification Commissioner's Office in the vicinity of eight townships, destroyed fourteen wooden pillars, and destroyed more than seven feet of telephone wire. Xilu Township blew up the blockhouse, distributed reactionary leaflets, and roared away. The independent fourth division's forward command post was located in Tangkeng, the junction of Jieyang and Fengshun. An order was immediately issued to all villages in the bandit suppression area of ​​each county to cut off people's traffic from 8:00 pm to dawn the next day. If you come and go to report the bandits' situation or for other important public affairs, you should hold bright lights, and absolutely obey the sentry's inspection and proceed along the designated route. Those who dare to disobey will be punished as bandits. (3) Sangpu Mountain, the junction of Chaoan, Chenghai, and Jieyang. After the Chaoan Detective Team and the plainclothes team searched this mountain in the same way as the garrison, there were no large groups of bandits. The garrison's capture of bandits was extremely strict. For example, last month, when they surrounded and searched Zhuanglong Township in Anbu, they captured more than 100 strong men. Those who have guarantors will be released, but the guarantee procedures are quite complicated, so there are no bandits there. (4) Qinglan Cave, the junction of Chaoan, Chenghai, and Raoping. This group is Hong Zhizheng's bandits, about four or five hundred people. The nearby districts and townships are mostly forced to pay rice and grain. The garrison is now suppressing them strictly. Hong's bandits fled from Raoping to Guanpoxia Ge, the junction of Zhao'an. This place is the most dangerous, with many mountain pits and stone caves. Yang Alu led his troops to draw smoke here, and more than 1,000 militiamen were wiped out here.</p>
<h3>Bandits in Eastern Hubei Surrounded - Armies Join Forces to Suppress Bandits on the Borders of Three Provinces - Zhang Xueliang Goes to Huangma to Supervise the Battle</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Zhang Xueliang, the deputy commander of bandit suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, has adopted a strategy of pursuing and attacking the remnants of bandits in the border areas of the three provinces since taking office in Wuhan. He has already designated elite troops to form a pursuit team to search and suppress bandits horizontally and vertically so that they cannot rest. On the one hand, he has built deep trenches and high fortresses in important areas and stationed heavy troops to prevent attacks. The bandits have broken through several times, but they have not succeeded, and their strength is gradually dying out. The false Fifth and Eighth Armies have merged and reorganized into the false Twenty-fifth Army, claiming to be three divisions, and are fleeing in the territory of Shangcheng and Lihuang counties, attempting to prolong their lives. After the reorganization of the bandit army, although its strength has slightly concentrated, it has suffered repeated losses, with only more than 2,000 people and guns remaining. In addition, with the material blockade and the depletion of resources, it will be difficult to defend itself. On July 25, the bandits fled to Diaolingji in eastern Shangcheng, looting food everywhere. They were attacked by Wang Yizhe's troops of the 67th Army and suffered hundreds of casualties. On the 27th, the bandits took advantage of the gap to flee west from Caojiaji via Shawa to Wushi Ancestral Hall between Baiqueyuan and Lishupeng, Hongjiazai, and Chongshanzhai, joining forces with the Guangshan False Independent Regiment, totaling more than 3,000 people. They were again attacked by He Zhuguo's troops of the 97th Army and the 25th Route Army. They fled north to Zhuanqiao via Liangting East. The 25th Route Shi brigade followed and suppressed them. On the 28th, they fled to Liangshuji and Kanjiapeng near Popihe, where they were intercepted by Liang Guanying's troops stationed in Popihe, killing more than 100 bandits. The bandits took advantage of the night to bypass the highway and flee to Yangfanqiao and Lijadian. The Shi brigade pursued them to Zhangjiafan and Hetoudian, and contacted the bandits occupying Beichenjia'ao and Chuanjiaqiao, killing hundreds of bandits. On the 30th, the Shi brigade pursued them to Qianjiahepeng and defeated the bandits again. Most of them fled to the high mountains between Dushaghe and Xuanhuadian, such as Liujiaqiao, Wangjia, Lingyun Temple, Darenjian, and Huangtulao, relying on the danger to stubbornly resist. The Shi brigade climbed up to attack and fought fiercely day and night, engaging in more than ten hand-to-hand combats without success. Later, after several aircraft bombed fiercely, the bandits could not support themselves and fled in a panic. In this battle, more than 1,000 bandits were killed or injured, and a large number of military supplies were abandoned. The strategic passes of Liujiaqiao were completely recovered by the Shi brigade. On the 2nd of this month, the bandits returned to disturb eastern Hubei and fled to Xijia Chong and Laojun Mountain, where they were chased and bombed by aircraft. They fled again to Lijiawan, Dazhuyuan, and Hujiahe. On the 3rd, Xiao Zhichu's troops of the 26th Army and Yu Zhaolong's brigade rushed from Xuanhuadian and Luwangcheng to intercept them, killing more than 300 bandits. They took advantage of the night to flee north of Xuanhuadian via Yangqiao and Xindianji to Panxindian and Yangjiadian. On the 5th, they fled north again to Shantang and Fengdian, and occupied Wulidian Langganpu with a part of their troops, burning, looting, and killing, which was extremely inhuman. Since the bandits collapsed, most of the people have not followed them, so they have changed their policy of temptation to hostility. At this time, Liu Duoquan's troops of the 105th Division rushed to encircle and suppress them from Xinyang and Huaibei, and joined forces with the security team to attack. The bandits heard the news and fled back to Zhutangdian. On the 7th, Yu brigade chased them from Jiandao to the east side of Gangdian and launched a fierce attack on the bandits. The bandits were caught off guard and fled to Gangdian and Nanda Mountain. On the 8th, Yu brigade caught up with them at Pengjiawan and fought fiercely all day long. The bandits were killed and injured and left more than 400 bodies. They fled in a panic to Yangjiadian and Wanjiaodian. On the 10th, Yu brigade continued to pursue them. The bandits joined forces with local scattered bandits to occupy the mountains and resist. They were again killed more than 100 people, captured more than 100 guns, and captured more than dozens of bandits. At this time, the Shi brigade of the Fifth Route Army, Xiao Junyang brigade, and Liu Shi launched a joint suppression from the east, west, south, and other directions. The bandits' vigor was completely frustrated and they dared not fight again. On the 11th, they fled south to Yaojiafan and Chaotian Mountain. On the 12th, they fled east to Wangjia and Dingjiaba. On the 13th, they returned to the mountains of Hujiahe and Likou in eastern Hubei. At this point, they were completely surrounded by the National Army. After repeatedly receiving good news from the front, Deputy Commander Zhang set off from Wuhan to eastern Hubei to supervise the suppression at 7:00 am on the 16th, leading senior staff officer He Kui and others. After briefly staying in Hengdian and Songbu, he stayed in Huang'an that night and reviewed Dong Yingbin's division of the 57th Army. On the 17th, he went to Lindian to review Chang Jingwu's division and stayed in Shaheji that night. Army Commander He Zhuguo had set up a temporary command post in a certain place in Huang'an in advance for Zhang to stay and command. It is said that Zhang plans to deploy in eastern Hubei before going to Huangchuan in southern Henan for inspection. Wang Yizhe, the army commander of the 67th Army, and Liu Handong, the division commander, came to Wuhan on the 17th for official business and decided to return to their posts on the 18th to greet him (17th).</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Deploys National Defense; Guangzhou Establishes Municipal Defense Committee; Shantou Inspects Population and Passengers</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, as the international situation has become urgent and diplomacy in South China has become increasingly serious, the Guangdong provincial authorities are actively reorganizing for national defense. Furthermore, the Guangzhou Municipal Government, in consideration of municipal defense, has also begun organizing a municipal defense committee, consisting of five members: one senior staff officer appointed by the General Headquarters, one executive committee member each from the provincial and municipal party headquarters, and two advisors and bureau chiefs appointed by the municipal government. The committee includes an economic group, a rescue group, an engineering group, and a technical group. The economic group is responsible for investigation, statistics, coordination, stockpiling, advance planning for city-wide coupon rations, controlling city-wide food supply, and the safe transport of refugees and wounded soldiers; planning the coordination of emergency finance; and raising emergency funds. The rescue group is responsible for summoning city-wide doctors and nurses, preparing all emergency rescue and sanitation work, concentrating city-wide sanitation materials and equipment, contacting city-wide fire brigades, and pre-planning emergency fire fighting, excavation, and burial work. The engineering group is responsible for planning the construction of city-wide land, sea, and air defense works. The technical group is responsible for guiding factories in the manufacture of smoke screens, gas, and other emergency chemical tools, and guiding factory workers in the manufacture of gas masks, steel helmets, etc. Each of the above four groups has one standing committee member. The Director of the Social Affairs Bureau serves as the standing committee member for the economic group, the Director of the Health Bureau serves as the standing committee member for the rescue group, and the Director of the Public Works Bureau serves as the standing committee member for the engineering group. The General Headquarters dispatches specialists to serve as the standing committee member for the technical group. Shantou connects to Quanzhou, Lianjiang, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen, and is located on the coast with a mixed population of Chinese and foreigners. Recently, it was rumored that Xiamen vagrants had secretly organized an armed force of about ten thousand people, infiltrating the interior with the intention of causing trouble. It is currently believed that this group of vagrants is hiding in Shantou, secretly operating. For preventative measures, in addition to maintaining strict security, the authorities also plan to implement inspections of inbound ship passengers starting on the 14th of this month. The inspection method will be determined by the Shantou Municipal Government and the Customs Superintendent's Office. A room will be borrowed within the customs office for use as an office. When customs officials inspect ships entering port, they must be accompanied by inspection personnel dispatched by the municipal government. The inspections will be conducted by two groups of inspectors from 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM each day. (The inspectors have already been appointed by the municipal government. When inspecting ships, they will verify the names on the lists submitted by consuls of various countries and shipping companies. For passengers in the steerage and other passengers not on the list, they can instruct the passengers to sign their names. If they cannot write, the inspectors will fill in the names on their behalf, and they must declare where they are coming from and where they are going, in order to facilitate investigation. No ambiguity is allowed. (12th)</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang: Zhenjiang County Government Rectifies Land Tax</h3>

<h3>Jiaxing: Three Suicide Cases in One Day</h3>
<p>This county has always been known as a wealthy area, and there have been very few cases of suicide. However, since last year's impact of rural bankruptcy, the number of suicide cases in society has been increasing day by day. Here are the details: (1) Feng Rongsheng, a resident of Dongchengmenkou, originally from Xiashi, was a coal merchant. He married a Ms. Zhang and had two sons and two daughters. The entire family depended on Feng alone for support. Feng initially opened a Feng Shuntai coal shop, but business declined last year and he declared it closed. He then opened a small liquor shop, but it also closed down in less than a month. He accumulated heavy debts that he could not repay, so he hanged himself yesterday. His wife and children cried and wailed, a very miserable sight. (2) Shen Amao, a villager from Kejiatai Township, Xitang, was extremely poor. The day before yesterday, a tenant farmer, Zhang, demanded rent from Shen, using all kinds of coercion. Shen, left with no choice, promised to pay on the Dragon Boat Festival to buy time. After Zhang left, Shen Amao became overwhelmed with resentment and hanged himself last night. (3) Bu Xiaoshang, a plasterer from Zengduowei, north of the Diaoqiao outside the West Gate, came from a relatively well-off family. This year, he completed the wedding for his son, Xu Jin. However, not long after, the father and son died one after another. Xu Jin's wife was restless and remarried. Bu Xiaoshang's wife suddenly felt lonely and helpless and was also facing financial difficulties, so she drowned herself in the river yesterday.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: All District Chiefs Go to the Province to Petition</h3>
<p>The district chiefs of the county's twelve districts, Zhu Wuchang, Wan Diankui, etc., are currently petitioning in the provincial capital because the county government has been in arrears with autonomous district funding for eight months, and only twenty yuan was allocated to each district for this Dragon Boat Festival, so the district chiefs are unwilling to accept it. On the morning of the 15th, all the district chiefs went to the provincial government's Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to petition, requesting that the county government be ordered to find ways to issue the owed funds in order to emphasize district administration.</p>
<h3>Haimen: The Case of Hugging a Female Student Escalates</h3>
<p>Lu Zhenyi, a teacher at the county's Shishan Central Elementary School, hugged a female student in the dormitory the day before yesterday and was caught by Lu Jinrui, a student in the sixth grade. The teacher Lu became enraged out of embarrassment and used a pretext to physically punish and expel the student Lu. The student Lu's mother, Lu Zhang Yanzhen, filed a criminal complaint against the teacher Lu with the county government. Yesterday, Cheng Shengshi opened a court session to investigate the case, confirming three areas of injury caused by the wooden instrument. The defendant, Lu Zhenyi, did not appear. The court instructed that the case be further investigated by the Education Bureau and then reviewed and handled. At the same time, the teacher Lu instigated more than a hundred ninth-grade students to petition the county party headquarters, the county government, and the Education Bureau, demanding that Lu Jinrui be punished for insulting the teacher. The relevant authorities met with them and persuaded them to disperse. However, both sides are taking extreme measures, and the situation is showing signs of escalating.</p>

<h3>Details of the Ping-Shen Through Train; China and Japan Will Announce Simultaneously; Officially Implemented on July 1st; Joint Organization to Manage It; -Huang Fu Will Go North Before the End of the Month-</h3>
<p>Regarding the Ping-Shen through train issue, because there are still some technical details to be discussed, it has not yet been officially implemented. According to recent news reports, the Japanese side is eager to start. Yesterday, a related party released the following information:</p>
<h3>Simultaneously Announce Final Details</h3>
<p>According to a person in charge of a certain relevant party, the Ping-Shen through train has now been decided to be officially implemented on July 1st. The through train details, which have been repeatedly discussed by China and Japan, have been agreed upon by both parties and will be announced simultaneously by China and Japan on the 28th of this month. During this period, if there are no other unforeseen incidents, there should be no postponement. Huang Yingbai, the chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Ping, who is staying in Shanghai waiting for the opportunity to mature, should be able to return to Ping before the end of this month to preside over everything.</p>
<h3>Joint Organization to Manage It</h3>
<p>The affairs of the Ping-Shen through train will not be managed by government agencies from either China or Japan. Instead, a commercial organization jointly established by both parties will operate it. Its form is roughly similar to the Wagons-Lits Company's management of international sleeping cars. It is reported that the Japanese side has decided to entrust the Liaoning Tourism Bureau to handle it. The bureau was registered with the Chinese government before the September 18th Incident. Its nature is to specialize in travel services and handle procedures such as selling passenger tickets. However, the Chinese side does not yet have a responsible agency for this matter. Among the government's considerations, the China Travel Service is deemed suitable for this task.</p>
<h3>The Difficulties of the China Travel Service</h3>
<p>Whether the China Travel Service will assume this responsibility is of great concern to the general public. According to the person in charge of the agency, the Ministry of Railways did indeed solicit the agency's consent for this matter and formally entrusted the agency to handle it. However, the China Travel Service is a purely commercial organization. Although it wants to support the government's efforts, it is deeply concerned that undertaking the Ping-Shen through train is a major responsibility and that disputes between China and Japan may inevitably arise in the future. In order to avoid dealing with political troubles, it is only willing to consider it and has not yet taken it on. It plans to convene a board meeting in the coming days to hear public opinions before making a decision.</p>
<h3>Borrowed Cars to Operate, Legally Registered</h3>
<p>The commercial organization that will operate the through train will be borrowing railways to operate vehicles. Now, with the official opening date approaching, it is naturally too late to purchase vehicles. It can only temporarily borrow cars from the Beining Railway or the South Manchuria Railway for initial operation. It is planned that after one year, the organization will raise funds to order passenger and freight vehicles for use. However, before officially starting the through train operation, the organization should register with the relevant Chinese government authorities in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations. The business profits will only be a commission of 5%.</p>
<h3>Permanent Nature to Avoid Puppet Manchuria</h3>
<p>According to news from official circles, the name of the through train commercial organization jointly established by China and Japan has not yet been determined, but its nature is permanent. When "Manchukuo" is recovered by our country through either military or political means in the future, this organization will not be affected in any way and will still be able to exist and operate. The content of the current through train details also absolutely avoids the participation of the name "Manchukuo." Although the Chinese side has not yet determined which agency will undertake it, it is generally expected that the China Travel Service will bear this responsibility.</p>

<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Rickshaw Owners' General Meeting Declaration states: "It is said that if things are not balanced, they will make a sound. Things are like this, and people are even more so. Our special district rickshaw merchants, from the beginning of their business to the present, have a history of several decades, and there are more than a thousand business owners, all under the control of the Municipal Council's Vehicle Affairs Department. All the regulations, rules, and systems promulgated by the department have been changed several times, and they have been able to consider the difficulties of the merchants and make appropriate arrangements in accordance with the situation and the law. The rickshaw merchants have always obeyed and proceeded accordingly. Since last year, the Municipal Council, due to the dissatisfaction of one or two Westerners with the rickshaw industry, specially established a Rickshaw Committee to conduct deliberations. As a result, the words of the representatives of the inquiry association were generally not adopted, but only based on untrue and insubstantial investigations, using the major issues of improving vehicles and helping rickshaw pullers, and suggested sixteen articles. Subsequently, the rickshaw merchants and pullers unanimously opposed them, but thirteen articles were still passed and a Management Office was established to preside over everything. Unexpectedly, since the establishment of the office, the so-called method of improving vehicles does not ask for material solidity and applicability, but only seeks formal modernity and beauty, and does not ask for the actual possibilities of the industry, and rashly advocates changing the style. Not only will the original vehicle capital be discarded, but the cost of making another vehicle will be doubled, and business must be repeatedly suspended for repairs. The loss of the rickshaw owners is of course substantial, and the rickshaw pullers will have no cars to pull, which will harm their livelihoods, and this is no trivial matter. According to the Management Office's announcement of the method of helping rickshaw pullers, from August, in addition to paying the prescribed rickshaw rental, rickshaw pullers must also pay a relief fee of one dime per day, which will be collected by the rickshaw companies and paid to the Management Office at the rate of 1.5 yuan per rickshaw per month, totaling 180,000 yuan per year, to be used as expenses for organizing a mutual aid relief society. From this point of view, it is actually exploiting the rickshaw pullers, and yet it is euphemistically called relief. Who will believe it? What is even more shocking is that the relief society will have three directors, who will be appointed by the Municipal Council from the current members of the Management Office: Massey, Zhu Maocheng, and Wang Zhicheng. All the expenses of the Management Office, estimated at about 50,000 yuan, and the registration fees for rickshaw pullers, about 40,000 yuan, will be borne by the relief society. In other words, it will be paid from the one dime per day collected from the rickshaw pullers. It is under the name of relieving rickshaw pullers, but in reality, it is used to fill the expenses of the newly hired staff handling rickshaw affairs. To sum up the above, these are the most unreasonable and most unreasonable proposals. Other demanding methods are too numerous to mention. Looking at its effect, it actually intends to deprive and eliminate the rickshaw industry. Our rickshaw owners, for the sake of business and for the sake of survival, have no choice but to struggle together. The decisions are as follows: (1) The Management Office is a redundant agency of the Vehicle Affairs Department, which does not understand the situation of the rickshaw industry, does not consider the hardships of the rickshaw merchants, and does not solicit the affordability of all related parties, and goes its own way. Rickshaw owners generally do not accept all measures of the office. All the certificates issued are purely a method of binding rickshaw owners, and we vow to refuse to accept them together to show our firm rejection. (2) The rickshaw industry has always been under the jurisdiction of the Vehicle Affairs Department. In the future, all tax payments, license renewals, delivery inspections, and business operations are still requested to be handled by the Municipal Council in accordance with the old regulations. (3) The rickshaw owners' method of maintaining business is to obey the legitimate struggle of this office. At this time of crisis and survival, if we rickshaw owners do not argue according to reason, not only will the rickshaw industry be on the verge of bankruptcy, but we are afraid that all Chinese merchants will have the worry of everyone being in danger in the future. At the 5th General Meeting of Members of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the above-mentioned strict measures of the Management Office, not only did not give full consideration to the parties involved, but also did not notify them in advance, and were forcibly implemented. It was raised for discussion, and it was deeply gratifying that all colleagues agreed to provide assistance and passed the motion. Our colleagues are concerned about their own interests, how can they not rise up to oppose the impossible proposals in order to maintain business and ensure survival. This is a special declaration, and we hope that you will take it into consideration.</p>

<h3>Sino-French Negotiations on Outstanding Issues Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the outstanding issues in the Sino-French negotiations in Shanghai, such as the subsidy for private schools in the French Concession and the division of police power in Xujiahui, it is understood that both our authorities and the French authorities feel that they should not be suspended for a long time and should seek a solution quickly. Representatives were separately designated by both sides to start negotiations, and the progress is satisfactory. It seems that a solution is possible soon.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond Boundaries Proceed Smoothly; Draft of the Temporary Agreement Framework Largely Determined</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after repeated discussions between Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Concession Municipal Council, regarding the negotiations on road construction beyond boundaries, there has been considerable progress. The draft of the temporary agreement framework for the issue has also been determined. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency learned about the recent progress of the negotiations as follows:</p>
<h3>Temporary Agreement Largely Determined</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side objected to the settlement, the negotiations on road construction beyond boundaries have been proceeding one step at a time and have been quite smooth. The draft of the temporary agreement framework has also been determined. The focus of the negotiations on the issue is (1) police district, (2) finance, and (3) police force. The police district and police force issues have now been resolved. The financial issue is still under negotiation. However, it is understood that the opinions of both sides are still close and can be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Police District and Police Force Issues Substantially Resolved</h3>
<p>The police district issue has now been demarcated to 7,923 mu (Translator's note: The area of the Public Concession is only 5,583 mu). It is said that this issue has been completely decided and there are no problems. The police force issue has also been decided. A police chief will be established in the road construction beyond boundaries area, who will be a Chinese. A deputy police chief will be appointed by the British. Under the deputy police chief, there will be two more police officers, one Chinese and one Japanese. Their powers are subordinate to the deputy police chief, and their names have not yet been determined. As for the number of police officers in the area, it has not yet been decided because the issue is minor.</p>
<h3>Financial Issues Still Awaiting Further Discussion</h3>
<p>The financial issue has become the center of the resolution of the case. Because the road construction beyond boundaries area is vast, the financial expenditure is very large. Therefore, a decision must be made in advance. The two sides are currently in negotiations. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, met with Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, last week. It is understood that the discussion on this issue has been held more than once. The Municipal Council's intention is that the financial expenditure in the road construction beyond boundaries area should be shared by the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council. The Municipal Government has not yet agreed, but the opinions of both sides are still close and can be resolved in the short term.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Dyeing Experiment Hall Signed Contract Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Cotton Textile Dyeing Experiment Hall signed a contract at the Cotton Industry Control Committee at 10:00 AM yesterday. The representative from the Academia Sinica was Cai Yuanpei, and the representative from the Cotton Industry Control Committee was Chen Guangfu. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Cultivate Specialized Talents</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Cotton Industry Control Committee has begun to send representatives to various provinces for investigation. Now, all investigators except for Tong Lüqing and others who went to Shandong have returned to Shanghai. As for the results of the investigation, they still need to be sorted out and will not be published until mid-August at the earliest. At the same time, the committee attaches importance to cotton planting and the cultivation of technical talents. Therefore, it consulted with the Academia Sinica to establish a Cotton Textile Dyeing Experiment Hall, the purpose of which is to cultivate talents in this industry so that the quality of our country's cotton yarn products is excellent, the cost is reduced, and it can compete with imported goods, so as to recover the outflow of profit rights.</p>
<h3>Five-Person Steering Committee</h3>
<p>The hall's funding is estimated at 400,000 yuan, with the Academia Sinica contributing 150,000 yuan and the Cotton Industry Control Committee contributing 250,000 yuan. The organization will be a steering committee composed of five people, with each party electing two representatives and jointly electing one representative. The steering committee will be responsible for all affairs of the hall. The steering committee members from the Cotton Industry Control Committee are Nie Lusheng and Li Shengbo. The jointly elected steering committee member is Tong Runfu. The steering committee members from the Academia Sinica have not yet been elected. All operating plans for the hall must be decided at the first steering committee meeting.</p>
<h3>Shipping, Customs Declaration, and Transportation Trade Associations Request Amendment to the Ordinance Prohibiting Drugs; Chiang Kai-shek Orders That There Is No Need to Worry; Legislative Yuan Refers It to the Criminal Law Committee for Reference</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Trade Association and the Transportation Trade Association believe that the second article of the Ordinance Prohibiting Potent Drugs issued by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission contains ambiguous wording and is prone to unjust convictions. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Executive and Legislative Yuan, requesting that the wording of the article be amended or supplementary articles be added. The responses from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek are recorded below: (1) Letter from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan: "The President has issued a case, stating that Article 2 of the Provisional Ordinance Prohibiting Potent Drugs, regarding transportation, is prone to unjust convictions, and requesting supplementary articles to be added to provide relief, etc. Approved, referred to the Criminal Law Committee for reference, etc. In addition to referring it, a corresponding letter is sent to you for reference."

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Baoshan Tooth Tax Bureau to Correct Illegal Collection of Tooth Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a special letter to the Baoshan Tooth Tax Inspection Office and the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office yesterday regarding the illegal collection of tooth tax by the Baoshan Tooth Tax Inspection Office, requesting strict correction in accordance with the tax law. The original letter is recorded below. “Dear Sirs, On the 17th of this month, we received a letter from the Timber Industry Trade Association stating that more than 20 timber companies in Zhabei, including Huisen and Tongfu, reported that recently, personnel from the Baoshan County Tooth Tax Inspection Office have been leading armed police to forcibly collect tooth tax licenses. They also misunderstand the 'Chu Xing' (delivery) mark on invoices as commission, considering them brokers, detaining them at the Baoshan County Government for punishment and demanding tooth tax licenses. Currently, two companies have been punished and issued licenses: (1) Zhabei Sanyang Tongli Timber Company was fined 20 yuan to obtain a license; (2) Qingyun Road Zhenfeng Timber Company was fined 80 yuan, also to obtain a license, causing panic among the people and making it difficult to maintain business. They request assistance, etc. According to this, after investigation, these companies are all operating with their own capital and are not buying and selling on behalf of customers or collecting commissions. Their nature is absolutely different from that of tooth brokers and they should not be required to obtain licenses according to the law. As for the words 'Chu Xing', they are a substitute name for the handling fee for delivery by the stackers, a habit that timber merchants have used for a long time. If this is used as a criterion, then any company can be regarded as a tooth broker, which is not only an illegal forced levy, but will also greatly affect the market. Therefore, we ask you to send a letter to the Baoshan Tooth Tax Bureau to stop this action, and also ask you to inform the 4th and 5th districts of the Public Security Bureau not to send police to assist, in order to stabilize business. Sincerely, etc. According to investigation, the timber companies under the said association are all operating with their own capital and are not buying and selling on behalf of customers. Their nature is completely different from that of tooth brokers. However, the Baoshan Tooth Tax Inspection Office hastily used the words 'Chu Xing' on the invoice, taking it out of context and interpreting it as a tooth broker, forcibly ordering them to obtain licenses and imposing fines. The handling is completely inappropriate. Regardless of whether the two words 'Chu Xing' are a substitute name for stacker fees or not, they are absolutely unrelated to tooth brokers. Even based on the long-standing commercial names, those specializing in wholesale and with larger scales are called 'Hang', while those with door shops for retail and with smaller scales are called 'Hao'. 'Hang' is one meaning, and 'Tooth Hang' is another meaning. Their nature should be distinguished by their business. There is absolutely no case where a company with the word 'Hang' on its signboard can be forcibly designated as a tooth broker. The Inspection Office is unaware of the commercial situation and illegally collects taxes without authorization. We hope you will strictly correct it, order them to return the licenses and refund the taxes, in order to maintain business and comply with the tax law. Sincerely.”</p>
<h3>Fresh Pork Industry Asks for Correction of Business Tax Rate in Jiangsu Province. Ministry Orders Implementation Based on Tax Rate of Five Per Thousand. Pork Industry Petitions to Abolish the Contractor System</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance implemented a business tax on pigs last year, originally based on the Anhui Province model of having merchants pay on behalf of others. According to the order of the Ministry of Finance, taxes should be levied at a tax rate of five per thousand. In May of this year, the Provincial Department of Finance changed the method and invited bids. The merchant Chen Shuaichu contracted for 135,000 yuan. The pork industry in this city believes that rural areas have declined this year and pig prices are extremely low. According to statistics, Jiangbei produces one million pigs annually. Based on the current estimated price, each pig is worth 10 yuan, totaling 10 million yuan. According to the five per thousand rate, the annual tax can be 50,000 yuan. After Chen Shuaichu took over, he planned to levy a tax of 1.5 jiao per pig, which is three times higher than the rate set by the Ministry. After jointly submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance for correction, the Ministry of Finance issued Approval Order No. 1469, stating that it has consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government to quickly instruct the Department of Finance to comply with the established case. Various industry groups have also sent letters to Chen Shuaichu, the commissioner for business tax collection, requesting that all accounts be temporarily recorded and paid in full after the tax law is determined. Various industry groups have also sent representatives to Beijing and Zhenjiang to petition for the abolition of the contractor system and the appointment of honest personnel to collect taxes fairly in accordance with the regulations. They will not stop until the goal is achieved.</p>
<h3>Preparation for the Establishment of the Municipal Botanical Garden</h3>
<p>The Municipal Botanical Garden of this city has been in preparation since the Municipal Government Education Bureau commissioned Shen Xiangrui, Chen Songchun, and Lü Hailan. The site has been selected as the location of Gaochang Temple Gezhi Academy. It is currently under active arrangement. The houses and trees are already roughly in place, but a large number of plant seeds still need to be purchased from various sources. The Municipal Government's funds are extremely tight, and it is difficult to allocate a large sum of money at once for the construction of everything. However, because the garden has been in preparation for a long time, it urgently needs to be established early. The expansion will be done later. The establishment period should be around mid-August.</p>

<h3>Road Bureau Stipulates the Authority of the Branch Office of the Labor Union. Cannot Independently Issue Documents and Telegrams to the Outside. Orders the Councils of the Two Road Labor Unions to Comply</h3>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administration issued an order yesterday to the councils of the two road labor unions, stating, "Regarding the instructions from the Ministry of Railways, General Order No. 9914, after reviewing the simplified rules for the organization of labor union branch offices, it has been stipulated by the central government and communicated to all roads by the Ministry in Order No. Ye Zi 6307 in March of the 20th year. According to the provisions of Article 2 of the simplified rules, labor union branch offices must not independently engage with external parties. Recently, it has been found that labor union branch offices on various roads often violate the regulations and indiscriminately issue documents and telegrams to external parties without authorization, which is inappropriate. We now order the Bureau to instruct the labor unions on the roads to communicate to all their branch offices that they must strictly comply with the central government's regulations. Any statements must be submitted to the labor union for review and forwarding. If the above-mentioned circumstances occur again, the Bureau must investigate and deal with them at any time to emphasize the importance of the law. This order, etc., is for the Association to be informed and instructed to comply. This order."</p>

<h3>National Government Inscribes and Awards a Plaque to Hu Wenhu, "Great Deeds and Extensive Charity"</h3>
<p>Hu Wenhu, the owner of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, visited Fujian in August last year. At that time, he was persuaded by Cai Hongji, the former Fujian Provincial Government's Tobacco Prohibition Commissioner, and Lin Honghui, the Magistrate of Minhou County, to raise funds to build the Fujian Model Prison. Hu generously agreed to donate 200,000 yuan to Fuzhou Hospital, and first allocated 80,000 yuan for the construction of the new prison. The funds were telegraphed to the Provincial Government by the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Bank in October of the same year. This time, after Wei Datong, the President of the High Court, returned to his post, he investigated the storage situation of the funds. He was approved by the Provincial Government and the Bank of China to reply that the funds were taken by the pseudo-organization's Ministry of Finance during the Fujian Rebellion. Wei believed that although the funds were gone, Hu was enthusiastic about prison affairs, and Cai and others worked hard to raise funds, so they could not be ignored and not recognized. He specifically requested the Ministry of Justice Administration to transfer the request for awards. Recently, the National Government approved the inscription and award of the plaque "Great Deeds and Extensive Charity" to Hu Wenhu, "Righteousness and Courage" to Cai Fengji, and "Benevolent Heart and Quality" to Lin Honghui. The High Court has already checked the inscriptions yesterday and sent them to Hu et al. for verification and collection.</p>

<h3>Fire Equipment in Gaoqiao Town. Du Yuesheng and Others Donate Fire Engines. The Public Security Bureau Requests the Municipal Government to Commend Them.</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng, a prominent figure in this port, believes that although Gaoqiao Town in Pudong is remote, it has become densely populated and industrialized in recent years. The fire equipment is not yet perfect. The town's fire brigade only has a few old-fashioned wooden cages, which are unable to provide assistance once a fire occurs, and are insufficient to maintain local security. Moreover, Du learned that Wen Hongen, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, had instructed the department to find ways to improve the situation. Therefore, he and local gentry invested in purchasing three of the latest model pump belt fire engines from the Aurora Fire Extinguisher Factory, worth about 8,000 yuan, and donated them to the town. They were shipped to the Pudong Fire Brigade for use yesterday. From now on, the fire brigade in the area can strengthen its forces. Director Wen is very impressed with Du et al.'s enthusiasm for public welfare and generous donations, and has specifically submitted a document to the Municipal Government to commend them for encouragement.</p>
<h3>Yu Taiji, Who is Still at Large, is Finally Arrested</h3>
<p>Yu Taiji, a prominent figure in Jiading, served as the captain of the detective team in the county from the first year of the Republic of China to the twentieth year of the Republic of China, and also concurrently held other prominent positions. He was very powerful. He is currently the chairman of the Fishermen's Association. Two years ago, he and Tian Zhihe, the chief of the Liutang Public Security Sub-bureau, were accused of taking bribes and releasing bandits. The case was reported by the county party department and ordered by the High Court to be investigated by the Local Court. Tian Zhihe and Yu Taiji were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment. During the appeal period, they were allowed to be released on bail. Later, the High Court sentenced Tian Zhihe and Yu Taiji to three years each and a fine of 600 yuan. Since the decision, both have fled and disappeared. Tian has since been arrested by the Local Court and has been escorted to the Caohejing Second Prison for execution, while Yu has three hidden places and also has sufficient potential, so it is not easy to arrest him and he has been at large. Now, the court has ordered the police Zhou Qiwu et al. to investigate and arrest him strictly. After the police purchased leads and investigated, it was not until yesterday that they obtained information that Yu Taiji often opened a room in Room 6004 of the New New Hotel. They immediately reported to the Laozha Detective Room and ordered Chinese and Western detectives to arrest him. However, Yu was cunning and had already planned to evade, so he had already left the hotel. However, the police knew his cunning, so they had already secretly deployed a dragnet, and as a result, he was intercepted between Guangxi Road and Sanma Road. He was immediately taken to the detective room to be identified and escorted to prison for execution.</p>

<h3>Limbs Severed, Blood and Flesh Flying. Worker in Japanese Cotton Mill Dies Tragically. Belt Fell Off, Iron Wheel Attempted to Repair. Unexpectedly, Clothing Was Caught and He Died Tragically.</h3>
<p>Dong Shoujun, a native of Yancheng, residing at 54 Changan Road, Zhabei, had no occupation. He had a son named Xinshan, 18 years old, who worked in the Japanese Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 7 at 213 Yichang Road. His wages were used to make a living. Unfortunately, at around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, when Xinshan was working in the weaving room of the factory, he suddenly saw the belt on the machine fall off the iron wheel. He tried to put the belt back in its original position. Due to temporary negligence, his clothes were suddenly caught and he was rolled into the machine. His limbs were immediately severed, blood and flesh flew, and he died on the spot. The scene was too horrible to look at. After being glimpsed by his companion Chen Youde and others, they rushed to close the machine door, but it was too late. The factory then reported to the Putuo Road Detective Room and ordered detectives to investigate. They managed to remove him from the machine and take his body and severed limbs to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the prosecutor assigned by the First Special District Local Court, accompanied forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi to the office to examine the body. After verifying the body, and after hearing Chen Youde's testimony of the previous situation, Mr. Guo ruled that the deceased, Dong Xinshan, male, had his limbs severed by the machine before death. The body was handed over to his father, Dong Shoujun, to sign for and take back for coffin and burial. It was also heard that the factory was only willing to pay a consolation fee of 100 yuan for the coffin and other expenses.</p>
<h3>Li Shuyun's Mother Sues Gu Renfa. Should be Prosecuted for False Accusation of Collateral Ascendants. So That Parents Can Avoid Being Heartbroken by Their Children.</h3>
<p>The case of Gu Renfa, the former Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, accusing his wife Li Shuyun's mother and daughter of selling official positions and accumulating money, which was widely publicized throughout the country, has been investigated several times by the Wuxi Court. It was determined that there was insufficient suspicion of a crime, and a decision not to prosecute was made. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The parts of Li Shuyun's accusation against Gu for bigamy and the counter-accusation of false accusation by Li's mother and daughter have been heard in court by the Wuxi Court twice. However, because Gu has never surrendered himself, the court could not proceed, so Li Shuyun was extremely saddened. She specially hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao the day before yesterday to supplement the indictment, requesting the Wuxi Court to arrest him according to law, so the third hearing this week is quite important. If Gu still fails to appear in court, the Wuxi Court will approve Li's request and issue an arrest warrant. However, although this case has been sensational for a long time, the outside world has never disclosed Li's mother and daughter's indictment. Perhaps some people want to read it quickly. We have obtained the original text of the indictment of false accusation against relatives by Li's mother, which is transcribed below. The words and expressions are sad and seem like the cries of the weak. The indictment states, "After investigation, the defendant, because he was threatened by Ai Chengmei's accusation of bigamy, wanted to use the Liu Zhuomin anti-delivery case as an excuse to falsely accuse and trap the plaintiffs, mother and daughter, in prison, in order to cover up his crime of cheating and marrying again. At first, he falsely used the power of the Civil Affairs Department to arrest the plaintiffs, mother and daughter, privately. After the court repeatedly summoned him, he refused to appear in court again. As for the charge of instigating obstruction of official duties, the testimony of Liu Zhuomin and his wife is conclusive and not related. The defendant has not been able to present any legal and positive evidence from the beginning to the present. The only reason is that he married his daughter, which caused the plaintiff to be imprisoned innocently for more than ten days, transferred through several counties, and severely restricted, treating her like a bandit. Day and night, she wondered what crime she had committed and what law she had violated. Can it not make all parents in the world cry together? According to the provisions of Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the plaintiff is actually the defendant's collateral ascendant. The defendant's intention to harm, fabricating facts, has already been fully exposed, and he has clearly committed the crime of false accusation under Article 180 of the Criminal Law. He should be prosecuted according to Article 181, Paragraph 2 of the same law for false accusation of collateral ascendants. Even if Su Zhang is resurrected, he cannot defend him. I beg you to strictly arrest the defendant and bring him to justice, prosecute him for his deserved crime, in order to rectify people's hearts and uphold the national law, so that all parents in the world can avoid being heartbroken by their children. I am deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>Accused of Abusing Adopted Daughter. Dance Hostess Shocked and Swallows Smoke. Why Abuse if Afraid of Seeing Officials?</h3>
<p>Zhang Aizhen, a dance hostess from the former Great Shanghai Dance Hall, is a local and is now 21 years old. She lives at No. 6 Huai'an Lane, Baker Road. Three years ago, she bought a six-year-old Jiaxing girl, Xiao Bao, as an adopted daughter for 50 yuan. She was exquisite and lively, and seemed quite lovable. However, Xiao Bao was still young and her knowledge was undeveloped. She inevitably stole food from time to time, which led to Zhang Aizhen's beatings, and she was beaten with chicken feather dusters on her face and legs. The China Children's Welfare Association was notified, and representative Zhao Jian, at 9:30 AM on the 13th of this month,</p>
<p>reported to the Xinzha Detective Room and sent Chinese Detective Li Shizhong and Detective Ding Huaguo to investigate and confirm the facts. They then took the young girl Zhang Xiaobao to the Detective Room and transferred her to Guangren Hospital, where the injuries were verified. The next morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court, where they were ordered to send Xiaobao to the Children's Welfare Association for temporary care. A summons was also issued and handed over to the Detective Room to order Zhang Aizhen to surrender herself to the Criminal Court of the court to await questioning. Yesterday morning was the scheduled date for the trial. Zhang Aizhen did not arrive. The lawyer Zhang Tianyin from the Detective Room stated that the Detective Room was prosecuting the defendant for injury under Article 294 of the Criminal Law. However, after receiving the summons from the court, the defendant was extremely frightened, which led to pessimism. Last night, she secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Fortunately, it was discovered early and she was sent to Renji Hospital by car. After the doctor performed surgery, she was out of danger and her life was not in danger. However, she could not be discharged from the hospital for the time being, so she could not be present in court today and requested a postponement. In addition, the young girl Zhang Xiaobao complained about being beaten by Zhang Aizhen, but now she does not want to accuse her. After reviewing the confession, Judge Wu Tingqi ordered the case to be adjourned for seven days for further questioning, and Zhang remains temporarily at the China Children's Welfare Association.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Weng Xisheng Case Involves Wang Xinggao Cannot Prove Wang's Involvement Surrendered and Immediately Released</h3>
<p>Last year, on November 7th, at 5:45 PM, Weng Xisheng was suddenly kidnapped by several bandits in Ziwu Pu. The bandits sent a letter demanding a huge ransom. The Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested several bandits, including Liu Yudong from Jiangbei, and sent them to the First Special Court. After several interrogations, Liu confessed that Wang Xinggao instigated the kidnapping. The police officers went to Wang's house to arrest him but failed. The Special Court issued an arrest warrant to apprehend him. Around 9:00 PM the night before last, Wang Xinggao (also known as Wang Xiaogao's son) from Funing, accompanied by lawyer Fan Gang, surrendered himself to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police chief ordered his detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The defendant hired lawyers Fan Gang and Jiang Yiping to defend him in court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council was prosecuting the defendant under Article 371 of the Criminal Law and Article 1, Section 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. The case against the defendant, Wang Xinggao, stemmed from the confession of the arrested bandit Liu Yudong, who stated that Wang designed and instigated the kidnapping of Weng Xisheng. The court issued an arrest warrant, but Wang had not been apprehended until the night before last when he surrendered to the police station with lawyer Fan Gang. Detectives Qi Mengqing and Western detective Hua Sheng had Liu identify the defendant in a crowd, but Liu could not recognize him. Therefore, it was unclear whether the Wang Xinggao mentioned by Liu was the defendant or someone else. Liu had been brought to the court for questioning. Liu Yudong then testified that he was from Jiangbei and did not know the defendant, so he could not identify him. When questioned, the defendant stated that his name was Wang Xinggao and that he had never met Liu. He had worked in the political arena, previously serving as the director of the Public Security Bureau of Guanghua County in Ningbo. In 1930, he was appointed as the chief of the intelligence section of the 19th Route Army. From August 1, 1931, he was transferred to Yichang, Hubei, as the warden of the Second Prison, a position he still held. He had taken leave to come to Shanghai on the 13th of this month to visit his elderly mother, after hearing from his wife that police detectives had been to his house to arrest him. Unsure of the reason, he went to lawyer Fan Gang for investigation. Lawyer Fan clarified that the Jing'an Temple Police Station had an arrest warrant out for him, so he surrendered to the police station. He argued that he was in Hubei when Weng Xisheng was kidnapped, so he could not have committed the crime. Furthermore, he had always been law-abiding and had never committed a crime. He did not know Liu Yudong at all and requested the court's judgment. Lawyer Fan presented several letters of appointment on behalf of Wang, stating that the case was clear and requesting an immediate release. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the testimonies and ruled that Wu Xinggao was innocent and released him.</p>
<h3>Cigarette and Paper Shop on Avenue Foch Burglarized No Loot Taken, One Thief Captured Shopkeeper's Wife Bravely Blocks the Door, Foiling the Thief Two Thieves Flee Seeing the Situation Unfavorable One Thief is Eventually Arrested</h3>
<p>At 7:45 PM last night, a small cigarette and paper shop on Avenue Foch in the French Concession was suddenly burglarized. Fortunately, the shopkeeper's wife was alert and blocked the door, preventing the thieves from entering. As a result, there were no losses. One thief was intercepted and captured by the police. The thief was shot twice and was on the verge of death. Details are provided below:</p>
<h3>Diligence and Frugality</h3>
<p>The Xie Da Chang cigarette and paper shop at No. 265 Avenue Foch in the French Concession is owned by Wang Zhengcai (35 years old) from Ningbo. Although the business is small, Wang and his wife are diligent and frugal, so their income is sufficient to maintain it. However, it attracted the attention of thieves. At 7:45 PM last night, three thieves suddenly arrived: two wearing long gowns and one wearing a short blue cloth jacket.</p>
<h3>Blocking the Door</h3>
<p>The three thieves walked to the entrance. The one in the long gown stood outside to keep watch, while the one in the short jacket entered with a gun. Because the shop's counters were all equipped with iron bars, the thief tried to sneak in through the side door. Fortunately, the shopkeeper's wife had noticed something amiss and bravely blocked the door, loudly asking the thief what he wanted. The three thieves, seeing the situation unfavorable, hurriedly fled in different directions.</p>
<h3>Firing a Warning Shot</h3>
<p>The shopkeeper's wife saw the three thieves fleeing and shouted for the police. In addition to the two thieves in long gowns escaping, one thief in a short jacket was pursued by policeman No. 235 from the French Concession Police Station, who heard the call. Nearby police officers also joined in the chase. The thief fired two warning shots along the way. The thief fled from Avenue Foch to Rue Garaud, crossed Avenue Baille, and entered Rue du Marché.</p>
<h3>Thief Enters a House</h3>
<p>The thief turned into Rue du Marché and fled into the Rue du Père Froc. However, the alley was a dead end. The thief turned back and escaped into a pottery shop owned by Zhang Xinglong (55 years old) from Ningbo at the entrance of the alley. He ran straight upstairs and hid in an empty pottery box in the loft. By this time, the French Concession Police Station had received information and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives. Detectives Zhu Julong, Chen Lishun, Bai Shouzheng, and others bravely rushed upstairs.</p>
<h3>Finally Captured</h3>
<p>The detectives went upstairs, and the thief was like a turtle in a jar, surrendering. However, he had been shot twice, once in the chest and once in the left waist. He was on the verge of death. A pistol with five bullets was confiscated. He was immediately taken to the Aurora Hospital on Rue du Père Robert. His injuries were reportedly severe, and his life was likely in danger.</p>

Mr. Martin then gave a reply, stating: "I have just arrived in Shanghai and am scheduled to leave in thirty-six hours. My friends have told me that my time in Shanghai is too brief, and I feel the same way. I believe there are many more places in Shanghai worth visiting. However, I need to travel to Nanjing, North China, Moscow, Berlin, London, and many other places in a short period, so I must leave Shanghai in a hurry. But I hope to have a longer stay when I have the opportunity to come to Shanghai again in the future. I am honored to be hosted by Mr. Zhang and the colleagues of the four organizations in such a quiet and beautiful garden, with not only exquisite refreshments but also such wonderful singing and music. Therefore, although I am leaving Shanghai in a hurry, Shanghai has left a deep impression on my heart."</p>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>To enhance the guests' enjoyment, the host prepared various entertainment programs. First, Tong Dianshun performed the amazing feat of playing with a jar, manipulating an ancient Chinese jar on his palms and head, which was very impressive.

<h3>Anti-Japanese General Zhou Juemin and Others Invent a Water Safety Belt</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Juemin, former Deputy Commander of the Fourth Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, after arriving in Shanghai, observed the dangers of navigation. If a ship has an accident, many passengers will surely be killed. Therefore, he, along with Ye Gongfu and Zheng Linxiang, graduates of Waseda University of Technology, carefully researched and invented a water safety belt to ensure the safety of passengers during navigation and prevent them from drowning. This belt is made according to physical science and has great efficacy, is easy to carry, and is sold at a low price. It was tested on the Huangpu River a few days ago. The belt is tightly tied to the body. After falling into the water, the belt can automatically float to the surface in less than seven seconds. It is truly necessary for travelers. It is reported that Zhou and Ye have applied to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for a patent registration. The office is located at No. 21 Renle Village, Chongde Lane, Rue Luban, named Qunyi Gongji Scientific Society, and has hired lawyer Zhang Shiying as its perennial legal advisor.</p>
<h3>A Tragedy of Teenagers' Illicit Affair The Girl Becomes Pregnant and Attempts to Elopes Unsuccessfully In Extreme Anger, She Kills Herself with Scissors to the Throat</h3>
<p>Shen Liutai from Ningbo, who is in the silk business, has a daughter named Yi Ying, who is 19 years old and not yet engaged. Fang Qixian from Haimen is in the same industry as Shen. Due to business relations, he often went to Shen's house in Yifeng Lane, Guizhou Road, to discuss transactions, which led to him meeting Yi Ying. Fang is 38 years old and not yet married. The two developed from friendship to love. In November of last year, they engaged in sexual relations. Unexpectedly, one night of passion resulted in the girl becoming pregnant. She is now six months pregnant with a large belly. Shen thought it was a disease and consulted doctors, but to no avail. The girl, fearing that her father would discover the truth, secretly plotted with Fang to escape. They decided to elope on the 16th of this month. Fang booked room 304 at the China Hotel as a temporary shelter before finding a house to live together. However, their plan was not secret. When the girl was packing her clothes, Shen discovered it and ordered the servants to secretly monitor her and prevent her from leaving. Seeing that her plan had failed, the girl closed the door and stabbed herself in the throat with scissors. Shen's family found out, broke into the room, but she was already unable to speak. She was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital informed the General Police Station, which ordered detectives Pang Jinshan and Mao Yunlong to investigate. They went to room 304 of the China Hotel and arrested Fang. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, explained the situation and prosecuted Fang under Article 257 of the Criminal Law. Shen Yi Ying was too ill to attend court. When questioned, Fang Qixian confessed to having an affair with Yi Ying in November of last year and that she was now six months pregnant. He claimed that the motive for the elopement was initiated by Yi Ying's stepmother. He cried incessantly, seemingly filled with boundless grief and regret. Judge Qian Hongye verified the testimonies and adjourned the case for another week.</p>
<h3>Changxing Steamer Sinks a Cargo Ship in Wuhu Reportedly Drowning Two Boatmen</h3>
<p>The Changxing steamer of the Sanbei Company, which was traveling from Hankou to Shanghai, sank a civilian ship in Wuhu. It is reported that two boatmen drowned. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The Accident: The Changxing steamer of the Sanbei Company is a regular Yangtze River vessel. On the 16th of this month, while traveling from Hankou to Shanghai, the Changxing was turning around to berth at the wharf in Wuhu. At that time, a civilian ship loaded with gypsum was also near the Sanbei barge in Wuhu. When the captain of the Changxing turned the ship, he urgently sounded the whistle, ordering the civilian ship to move away quickly so as not to obstruct the berthing. However, the civilian ship ignored the warning. The river water was very turbulent. The Changxing ship was swept sideways and unable to stop, resulting in a collision with the civilian ship.</p>
<p>Sinking of the Civilian Ship: Because the civilian ship did not heed the Changxing captain's warning, it was impacted by the current when the Changxing was berthing at the barge. The rear of the civilian ship was destroyed by the Changxing steamer. The civilian ship was entirely to blame and the Changxing steamer bears no responsibility. After the civilian ship was damaged, all the gypsum in the ship fell into the river, and all the boatmen on board fell into the water. The Changxing steamer tried to rescue them and pulled the boatmen out of the water.</p>
<p>Report to Shanghai: The sunken civilian ship, along with the gypsum and other goods on board, incurred huge losses. According to the boat boss who was rescued, two boatmen who fell into the water could not be recovered and may have drowned. The search for the missing persons is still underway. Yesterday, the Changxing steamer returned to Shanghai from Wuhu. The captain reported the incident to the company in detail, stating that he had warned the civilian ship to move away, but the Changxing steamer could not avoid the collision. The families of the victims will seek compensation from the company.</p>
<h3>Zhang Sumin Lectures on Exchange Control</h3>
<p>Economic expert Dr. Zhang Sumin gave a lecture yesterday at the invitation of the International Trade Society of Fudan University on "The Classical School's Theory of International Trade Balance and Today's Exchange Control." His speech was insightful and well-received. A summary of Dr. Zhang's speech is as follows: The classical school believed that international trade always tends towards balance. If an imbalance occurs in trade between two countries, it will soon be restored. The philosophical background of this theory is laissez-faire, which is contrary to today's control policies. However, its theoretical content, such as the rise of foreign exchange or the low price of domestic goods, which can encourage exports, and the fall of foreign exchange or the high price of domestic goods, which can encourage imports, is still the basis for today's exchange control. Today, there are only two types of exchange control: one is that the government sets up a foreign exchange bureau, adopts a fixed exchange rate, and restricts and allocates foreign exchange, which can be called the Continental or South American style; the other is that the government sets up an Exchange Stabilization Fund to manipulate the exchange rate, which can be called the British and American style. The first type is clumsy, and the second type is very skillful. Now, let's focus on the second type. The Exchange Stabilization Fund was first established in Britain, followed by the United States. The United States initially allocated 2 trillion US dollars for this fund this year and has only recently used it to purchase gold and silver, so its history is very short and not worth mentioning. The British fund was established by the newly promulgated financial law in April 1932 and began to operate on July 1 of the same year. The initial fund was 175 million pounds. After the United States abandoned the gold standard, it increased by another 200 million pounds. Its purpose is nothing more than: (1) to lower the exchange rate of the pound sterling to increase exports; (2) to permanently retain capital fleeing from other countries in Britain. The operation of the fund is very secret. But what we know is that Britain initially used the fund to purchase US dollars, absorbing British cash. In this way, it lowered the pound sterling on the one hand and increased the reserve of the Bank of England on the other hand, which can be said to kill two birds with one stone. After the United States abandoned the gold standard and banned gold exports last year, the role of the British fund began to be hit, so it turned to France, that is, it changed to buying French foreign exchange, lowering the value of the pound against the franc, so as to absorb French cash. In addition to purchasing foreign exchange, the British fund also directly purchases cash, but its purchase of cash is even more secret. As for the lessons we have learned from the British fund: (1) Lowering the exchange rate of domestic currency against foreign currency is conducive to the export trade of the country. Purchasing cash has less to do with export trade. (2) The operation of the exchange fund is only effective for countries that do not prohibit cash exports. (3) The number of funds must be large, such as Britain's 375 million pounds and the United States' 2 trillion US dollars. (4) China is a country that uses silver, and the problem is more complicated. It is not easy to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Bicycle Kills a Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Mrs. Huang Liu, mother of Huang Yifu, a resident of No. 8 Yongji Lane, Sapo Sai, French Concession, was 50 years old this year and had always been addicted to alcohol. On the Dragon Boat Festival, after enjoying a festival meal and drinking wine at home, Mrs. Liu went out shopping at 1:45 PM. She was walking along the right side of the road, heading south on Rue Massenet, when Liu Liansheng (21 years old) from Jiangbei, a rickshaw puller residing at No. 20 Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, was riding a bicycle northwards and collided with her, causing her to fall and injure her head. The police found them and took both parties to the police station. Mrs. Liu was transferred to Renji Hospital, but she died of her injuries at 8:00 PM the next night. The hospital notified the police station, which moved the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, the Traffic Department of the French Concession Police Station reported to the Second District Court of the Special Court. The chief prosecutor and forensic doctor arrived at the hall to examine the body. The son of the deceased filed a request for justice. The official questioned the defendant about the circumstances of the accident and ruled that Huang Liu had indeed been hit by a vehicle, causing a brain injury and death. The body was taken by the family for burial. The defendant was returned to the Traffic Department for handling.</p>
<h3>Free Water Supply To Aid in Summer Disease Prevention</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, in order to cooperate in the prevention of cholera, has, at the request of the Central Epidemic Prevention Bureau, consulted with the Shanghai Waterworks Company and plans to follow the same method as last year and the year before by providing free clean water to Chinese residents in areas where household water pipes have not been installed in order to prevent cholera. The Board of Directors of the Shanghai Waterworks Company has agreed to do so and has expressed its willingness to fully assist in epidemic prevention work. The Municipal Council has sent a letter to the company to express its gratitude.</p>
<h3>Penglai Bank Robbery Those Arrested are a Motley Crew Includes Prostitutes and Cigarette Factory Workers All Detained for Rendezvous</h3>
<p>On the 8th of last month, the Penglai Bank on Penglai Road in the Nanshi was broken into and robbed of a large sum of money. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau immediately launched an investigation. Recently, Detective Gu Liancheng discovered that the robbers were hiding in rooms 36 and 46 of the Xinyuelai Hotel at No. 74 Guangdong Road in the Public Concession. The day before yesterday, he, together with Chinese detectives He Renrui and Cui Yulou from the Laozha Police Station, went to the address and arrested Kang Amao (a hotel tea boy), Chen Alin, Ge Yousheng, Fan Jinsheng, Chen Sandi, Yang Shenggen, Wu Hongxiang, Guo Bingwen, Chen Hongsheng, Chen Guiqing, Huang Liangqing, Shen Xingsheng, Li Zhirong, Chen Hongsheng, Zhu Xingfu, Wang A'er, Lu Jinquan, Huang Genchu, and women Gu Sannan (a prostitute), Chen Hu, Wang Meiying, and 21 other people. Three pistols, 24 bullets, one hand grenade, two coils of lead wire, and one axe were confiscated and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, explained the case and stated that the Public Security Bureau had sent personnel to the court to receive them. Detective Gu then submitted an official document requesting permission to transfer them. When questioned, the defendants all denied involvement, claiming compensation or visiting friends. However, the testimonies of Zhu Xingfu and Wang Meiying were quite amusing. According to Zhu, Wang was his first lover, and they went to the hotel for a rendezvous, resulting in their mistaken detention. Wang Meiying testified that she works in a cigarette factory and met Zhu on the way yesterday. She claimed that Zhu repeatedly enticed her, so they went to the hotel together and opened room 35, intending to enjoy themselves, but were arrested. She insisted that it was their first time. Judge Qian Hongye verified the testimonies. Because some of the defendants may be completely unrelated, he adjourned the case for another week and ordered the police station to request the release of the three unrelated people as soon as possible to avoid implicating the innocent.</p>

Then, they voluntarily reported the workers Wu Qisheng, Bian Huimin, He Shoulian, Chang Fangcai, and the fourth person, who caused the trouble by pouring manure in front of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau in April, and punished them. In addition to publicly apologizing and bowing three times to the portrait of the Prime Minister, the workers observed five minutes of silence to show their repentance and each submitted a letter of remorse to the association, guaranteeing that they would not engage in out-of-bounds behavior in the future.</p>

<h3>(1) About Reading Clubs</h3>
<p>The Youth Association Reading Club held its founding meeting the day before yesterday (17th). Our connection with the Youth Association Reading Club seems to be coming to an end. However, we feel it is necessary to have one more written conversation with our readers.</p>
<p>The news of the reading club was published in our 5th issue, just two months ago. During this period, we have received letters from our readers every day, with more than 600 inquiries and suggestions. We are very ashamed that we were unable to reply to each one individually, but we have continuously reported the news of the reading club in our publication. Later, because the number of people who signed up increased to 200, objective difficulties made it impossible for us to proceed alone, so we discussed co-sponsoring it with the Youth Association. Although everyone agreed, the Youth Association had to take full responsibility in the operating system, and we could only provide spiritual assistance. Since the Youth Association took over this matter, we sent out notices of the meeting to the readers who had signed up at our library, asking them to go to the Youth Association to pay their membership fees and pick up their membership cards. At the same time, several of us were honored to be hired by the Youth Association's Intellectual Education Department as reading club consultants, and we will still have the opportunity to meet everyone in the reading club, which is very gratifying. Furthermore, we contributed many of our experiences in guiding reading to the Youth Association for reference. In this way, we have done our best in terms of social service. Although we are very sorry that we cannot do this work alone, there are many things that we have done that are not fair to our readers. Many readers have written to us blaming us and asking us to announce the reasons for cooperating with the Youth Association. In fact, we have no other reasons to say other than the news published in the various issues of this publication after the fifth issue. Now that the conference has been held, we still need to make a brief statement of the above process to end this pending case.</p>
<p>We were very happy to participate in the founding meeting the day before yesterday. When we saw the serious and enthusiastic discussion of the students in the advanced class about the group division, it was probably a phenomenon that no university has! This is undoubtedly a very gratifying phenomenon. Reading clubs undoubtedly have a very broad future.</p>
<p>This work has come to such an end in our department. If readers have any questions about the reading club's news in the future, please send them directly to the Youth Association. This department will not collect or reply to any letters. However, in the "Information" column of this publication, we plan to compile and publish news about the Youth Association Reading Club in a considerable period of time to report to the readers outside the department who are concerned about the reading club.</p>
<p>(Two pieces of information)</p>
<h3>(1) Reader Correspondence Stationery to Be Sold Soon</h3>
<p>The stationery is printed on Daolian paper, and each sheet can write 350 characters. The name, mailing address, Xth communication, and the nature of the question are attached around the four weeks. It is both practical and beautiful. The printing cost is about 20 cents in silver for each hundred sheets packed into a book. It will be sold at the inquiry desk of the library soon. We have decided to use this stationery entirely from August 1st, and we hope that readers will be able to implement the decision of our department as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>(II) No Manuscripts Accepted</h3>
<p>We often receive many great works from readers, requesting introductions and publication. However, since we currently have no publication plans and no publishing department of our own, we really cannot accept manuscripts. As for recommending bookstores, not only do we not have the spare time to negotiate with bookstores, but most bookstores are also not accepting manuscripts at this time. We are truly unable to help. To prevent loss during return postage, we ask that readers please do not send manuscripts to us in the future. Even if sent, we will return them immediately without opening them. Please forgive us!</p>
<p>Book Recommendation</p>
<h3>Wen Xin (Literary Mind)</h3>
<p>Co-authored by Xia Gengzun and Ye Shengtao　　　　　Price: 70 cents　　　　　Published by Kaiming Bookstore　　Wen Xin is a book that uses a narrative style to write about the entire body of knowledge concerning Chinese language and literature. In terms of format, it is an unprecedented work. Mr. Xia and Mr. Ye truly deserve to be called the Chinese equivalents of [Waldemar] Kaempffert. In the sense of popularizing difficult-to-understand knowledge, the publication of this book deserves special attention. The entire book consists of thirty-two articles, each discussing a theme related to Chinese language and literature. Because the authors can melt abstract knowledge into concrete facts, even though it is a work discussing "literature," it does not feel difficult to read. Theory does not hinder the development of the story; we only feel that the more we read, the more fresh, vivid, and captivating it becomes.</p>
<p>After recommending this book, we feel even more that what China needs most right now is someone who can write stories like "Wen Xin" about social science and natural science knowledge, making it easier for the public to absorb knowledge that they usually dare not ask about. We ourselves are now also working towards this direction.</p>
<p>We all need a Mr. Kaempffert!</p>

<h3>Imperial Incense Misty Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I cannot help but think of a story about clothing. This story is still vividly imprinted in my mind, as if it happened yesterday. It was the night after the Empress Dowager's birthday. Because there would inevitably be a grand birthday celebration tomorrow, we were all busy preparing our clothes. However, I happened to not have suitable attire. Or, it could be said that I did have some, and its style and color were exquisite, pleasing me very much. Unfortunately, this garment had sable fur trim, and the time for wearing sable had not yet been officially announced! If I openly wore this fur-trimmed garment to kowtow and offer birthday wishes to the Empress Dowager, I would be charged with the crime of disobeying and exceeding the prescribed rituals. However, in all fairness, it was already approaching the twelfth month, and the weather was indeed very cold. The problem was that the Empress Dowager's decree had not yet been issued, and no one dared to wear fur. Not only did no one dare to wear it, but there had never been anyone bold enough to suggest to the Empress Dowager that she issue the decree for changing to fur clothing earlier. But this time, I bravely suggested it to her. It can truly be said that I took a great risk! But it could only be said that the opportunity presented itself by chance and did not entirely depend on my courage. At the time, I was standing behind the Empress Dowager as usual, because she often ordered me to handle various tasks for her, so I always stood very close to her. A gust of wind blew by, and she seemed to shiver a little, murmuring, "This weather is really too cold!"</p>
<p>As soon as she said this, I immediately recognized that it was an excellent opportunity. My courage suddenly grew bolder. This is not an exaggeration, readers should know that one could not speak casually in front of the Empress Dowager. Speaking improperly would often lead to immediate punishment. (61)</p>
<h3>On the Meadow</h3>
<p>— Ma Ying</p>
<p>At dusk, a crowd gathered on the meadow;</p>
<p>Old, young, villagers, pretty girls. The first three rows were seated on long benches, and those without benches stood in a circle, but everyone remained motionless, eyes wide and ears open, like statues carved from wood.</p>
<p>But if you had the strength to break through the crowd, you would see a table, a broadsword, and a small gong. Beside the table stood a gentleman with a bronze face, wearing an old long gown, perhaps with a fan in his hand. He was indeed an all-powerful figure, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, sometimes acting as a hero, sometimes as a beauty. It was these heroes, beauties, weeping, and silly smiles that captivated the souls of the surrounding people.</p>
<p>"Hark! Look at Zhao Zilong's spear, thrusting left and parrying right, sweeping across the top..." The gentleman shouted, his legs already posed, eyes wide with anger, waving the fan in his hand in the air, as if he were Zhao Zilong, and the folding fan was the silver spear.</p>
<p>The listeners were delighted, yet somewhat uneasy, fearing that the silver spear might sweep over and stab a few transparent holes.</p>
<p>But Zhao Zilong had already fought to the ancient well, encountering Lady Mi. Thus, the gentleman, in a state of panic, abruptly diminished his heroic aura, becoming graceful and delicate, speaking in the soft voice of a nightingale, clearly transforming into a female body in less than a second.</p>
<p>The listeners were even more delighted, but all opened their mouths wide and widened their eyes, as if they all wanted to rush in and kiss Lady Mi.</p>
<p>In this flurry of sudden changes between male and female, laughter and tears, the gentleman received a considerable reward, and the surrounding people also gained considerable comfort, all leaving contentedly. Only the lonely meadow remained in the twilight.</p>
<h3>A Cold</h3>
<p>— Yan Bоguang</p>
<p>In early summer, the weather is most prone to change, turning hot one moment and cold the next. If we are not constantly mindful of our clothing, it is easy to catch a cold. The symptoms of a cold are a stuffy nose, headache, or cough, causing extreme physical discomfort. If we take a few aspirin tablets every day, we will be well in three or four days.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese are very superstitious. When they catch a cold, they write something on a red paper and randomly stick it on someone else's white wall. The words are: "Selling a severe cold, success upon sight." According to experienced people, sticking these two sentences on someone's wall or a telephone pole will cure one's cold within three days.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it is clear that the Chinese lack morality. Having caught a cold themselves, they want to pass it on to others. Now, as we are promoting the New Life Movement and striving to promote old morality, I hope the Chinese people will no longer engage in such superstitious behavior, lest foreigners laugh at us. Common colds are easily contagious. The infected person did not see "Selling a severe cold, success upon sight."</p>
<p>Recently, my two young daughters at home have caught colds, and almost everyone in our family of over twenty has had it. Did we all buy it from someone else?</p>
<p>It is evident that this superstition is self-defeating.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of Northeast China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty</p>
<p>Gazing after the departing wild geese, he buried himself in defending the homeland</p>
<p>A bullet pierced a strong arm, dyeing the desolate city with blood</p>
<p>After resting now, the sweat on his body had cooled down. His face gradually felt a bit cutting. The wind in the open square struck his body, and he couldn't help but shiver. Looking up at the sky, the sunlight turned pale red. The clouds rolled into thick clusters, becoming egg-yolk yellow, reflecting upwards from the snow on the ground, making him feel that this universe was tinged with death. Therefore, there was not a trace of green to be seen in the sky, nor a single bird flying across it. Slowly, one or two stars appeared in the gray sky, indicating that dusk was approaching. He felt an indescribable emotion in his heart, as if there was something he hadn't done, something he should continue to do. But he also knew clearly that this was not the case. It was a psychological effect, making him confused. So, he resigned himself to returning to the company headquarters to handle official business, hoping to dispel the psychological depression through hard work. After a day of toil, when nine o'clock in the evening arrived, the bugle call for rest sounded. He collapsed on the bed first, peacefully losing all awareness. But just as he was feeling comfortable in his sleep, the urgent bugle call shattered into his eardrums. In this kind of environment, a company commander can hear even an ant walking under his feet. How could Zhao Ziqiang not sense such an urgent call? Therefore, he jumped up immediately, put on his clothes as quickly as a flash of fire, and ran to the brothers' room to see if they had gotten up. Hearing the brothers' commotion in the dark, he ran back to his room, fastened his ammunition belt, and slung on his pistol. The entire process could not have taken more than ten minutes. Then, a messenger ran over to Ziqiang and said, "The battalion commander requests the company commander to come immediately." Ziqiang had barely answered a word when the messenger turned and left, apparently to deliver the same order to another company commander. (412)</p>
<h3>The Panchen Lama's Visit to the "Star" Film Company: A Brief Account</h3>
<p>— Bi Yin</p>
<p>The night was a net cast across the earth, the moonlight crystalline, brightly illuminating the quiet sidewalks.</p>
<p>Several cars, like red leaves floating on a river, glided along Xishe Road, driving straight into the Star Film Company.</p>
<p>Stopping, a crowd of people rushed and thronged into the reception room. Zheng Qiujian and others, with beaming faces, were warmly receiving the Panchen Lama, who was about to return to Tibet to preside over political affairs. The Lama, wearing a yellow robe, nodded his head frequently with a dignified air, expressing his appreciation to everyone.</p>
<p>After visiting various departments, they all returned by car.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>The next day, the Lama came to the Star Studios again, specifically to watch the filming, accompanied by Li Dachao, Wang Xiaoying, and others.</p>
<p>That evening, they were filming "Three Sisters," directed by Li Pingqian.</p>
<p>"This film is adapted from the famous work 'New Pearl' by the Japanese writer Kikuchi Kan. The story tells the tragedy of three sisters who suffer oppression after the death of their father, a painter. Some are alert, some are wavering, and some are declining. It depicts in detail the manipulation of women by crowned gentlemen, such as pursuit, love, dislike, and abandonment. It also offers a deeper satire and critique of the ugliness of the male-dominated society," the translator explained to the Panchen Lama.</p>
<p>"It is said that the film is scheduled to premiere at the New Light Theater during the old lunar Dragon Boat Festival."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh."</p>
<p>The night wind withered the moonlight, and they all returned home by car, weary and bathed in the silvery light.</p>
<h3>Observations in a Letter to a Friend</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>(Candle Shadow Swaying Red) The ocean of songs and music, leaning against the vermilion railing, surprised by the first sight. Tears of red remain beneath the peach blossom fan, not the usual swallow. A unique sorrowful resentment for the passing spring. Talking lightly, Mount Penglai is not far. A hundred kinds of plays in the mundane world, emerald towers, breaking the heart so many times. Laughing at your deep affection, the dreams and thoughts of the heart are like rolled-up banana leaves. Lightly testing the promised future with fine wine, ruining the flower-like face. Gratefully thanking the warbling orioles, who cares for the splendor of bygone years. In the old garden tonight, after finishing embroidering the palindrome, how boundless is the longing.</p>
<p>Chatter</p>
<h3>My Talk About Dogs (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have loved raising dogs the most, so I have some experience with their living conditions. Now I will introduce my experiences in raising them.</p>
<p>(1) Things to note when buying a puppy: Generally, two months after birth is the weaning period. At this time, the nutrients and calcium in the mother's milk are no longer sufficient to supplement the puppy's nutrition. They should be fed other foods to help their development. Puppies are most often born in April or May each year, but dogs born in summer are prone to shedding. Therefore, it is better to raise dogs born in winter. When I was in Beijing, I would always go to the Land God Temple, Longfu Temple, and White Pagoda Temple to see the dog markets during temple fairs. At that time, I raised eight large and small white Pekingese dogs, all of which were very clever. When I returned south in 1927, I was asked by friends for four of them, and I brought four back. Among them, two had completely understood human speech and could be used by servants to fetch things at any time. Later, I reluctantly gave them to Mr. Wang Xiaolai. Mr. Zhou Yawei, who shares the same hobby as me, has a dwelling that is almost entirely occupied by his pack of dogs. Every day, except during office hours, he spends almost the entire day playing with the dogs. The most important thing to pay attention to when buying a dog is to determine if it is healthy. That is, (1) see if the dog's body is developed, fat, and strong, and if its movements are lively, (2) if its eyes are bright, (3) if its nose is moist, (4) if its coat is shiny, (5) and if its stool is slightly hard. If it has all five of these conditions, it can be determined to be healthy. According to our country's common saying, dogs with short snouts that bark well are called guard dogs, while dogs that are fat and don't bark are called food dogs. If the back is curved, fluid leaks from the eyes, the eyeballs are not clean, the nose is dry, mucus constantly flows from the nose, the stool is loose, walking is impaired, and the gums are pale white, then there are signs of illness. The next thing is to determine the age. When choosing to buy a puppy, you should know its age. If the milk teeth have already erupted, it is two months old. If the incisors (the two teeth in the front) have been replaced with permanent teeth (white and large teeth), it is four months old. If the middle teeth (the teeth next to the incisors) have been replaced, it is about five months old. If the corner teeth (the teeth next to the middle teeth) have been replaced, it is about five or six months old. If the permanent teeth are completely erupted, it is six months old. Finally, you need to distinguish the dog's good intentions. This is very difficult. People who have never raised dogs will naturally not understand. Usually, people choose to buy dogs based on their own preferred appearance. However, the most important aspects of appearance are: (1) the body should be round and long, (2) the neck should not be too long, (3) the head and face should be short and broad (except for dachshunds and Shiba Inu breeds), (4) the limbs should be thick and strong, (5) the whites of the eyes should be densely covered with red veins, (6) both ears should perk up and tense when hearing a sound, (7) and when suddenly seeing a stranger, the eyes should be bright and focused. If it has the above seven essential features, it can be considered a good breed. (2) How to build a dog house: The dog's house should be placed in a dry, sunny place, so it is warm in winter and cool in summer. It should not be placed in a busy place. The dog house is best made of wood, with the middle filled with straw sacks (changing to mats in summer). The entrance should be nailed with staggered boards to facilitate cold protection in winter. The house should be one foot above the ground. The dog house should be regularly cleaned and disinfected. The most common dog disease is Hilaria disease, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. Therefore, the entrance of the dog house must be covered with wire mesh, and the door should be opened and closed with a double-sided active spring. The floorboard should be washed with disinfectant, so as to prevent pests from occurring. (3) Feeding: Weaned puppies should first be fed thin porridge, mixed with some pig liver and beef, and gradually mixed with other foods. The amount of food should not be too much, only about 80% full. However, you must not feed hot food or spicy or sweet things. You must also always give clean, warm water, especially in summer. Pickled vegetables can aid digestion, so add a small amount each time. Small meat bones are the dog's favorite food. Bones contain calcium phosphate and should be fed regularly.</p>

<h3>North China Games: Recent Preparations</h3>
<p>The grandstand for the athletics field is over half complete.</p>
<p>Swimming pool is planned to be rented elsewhere in Peiping</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch: The 18th North China Games are scheduled to be held in Tianjin on the Double Tenth Festival (October 10) this year. The preparatory committee has already been established, and various departments have also started working. The sports field is being built at the General Station, north of Beining Garden, a spacious location that is sufficient for the needs. At the moment, the grandstand for the athletics field is two-thirds complete, and various preliminary competition venues are also under construction. Regarding the swimming pool, it was originally planned to be built in Tianjin, but due to funding reasons, it is now planned to be rented in Peiping. A location has not yet been decided. It will only be resolved when the North China Sports Federation convenes a meeting. The internal work is currently very active, and the competition department is even busier. However, most of the department heads are Education Department officials, and many have now left their positions. For the time being, no one is responsible, and the work has temporarily come to a standstill. The recent developments in sports construction and the internal preparations are listed below.</p>
<h3>Construction Status of the Venue</h3>
<p>The construction project of the North China Sports Meet venue, after the first standing committee meeting decided to build it at the north training field of Beining Garden, due to its low-lying and sunken terrain, was initially contracted to the Sino-German Soil Filling Company for filling and leveling. It officially commenced on December 18th of last year. Over the months, the progress was generally smooth. The original completion date was set for the end of April this year. However, due to adverse weather conditions in the middle, and the false pretense of the puppet state recruiting laborers to cross the border, a large number of workers were lured to abscond, causing the ongoing soil filling project to stagnate for many days. The filling and leveling was not fully completed until May 25th. The Preparatory Committee, recognizing the Sino-German Company's delay was due to obvious difficulties, leniently decided not to penalize them. The company is currently working on filling small ditches, which will form the roads of the venue.</p>
<p>The construction project of the sports field was contracted by the Tianjin Zhenxingcheng Construction Company, with a construction cost of over 248,000 yuan. In early May, the company began building the foundation. On May 16th, the former Director of Education, Chen Baoquan, representing the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, Yu Xuezhong, personally officiated the groundbreaking ceremony. Since then, the project has progressed more actively. As of now, two-thirds of the entire horseshoe-shaped track and field grandstand has been completed, with only eight small sections of ordinary stands remaining. All stands are constructed with reinforced concrete, and the steel pipe railings are connected with 8-inch wide concrete pillars, inserted into the lower base pillars by about 14 inches, making them exceptionally strong and safe. Except for the commander's platform and the east grandstand, which have 21 tiers, the ordinary stands have varying numbers of tiers, such as 15 or 12. The total capacity of all the stands is estimated to be over 30,000 spectators. The construction of the surrounding 500-meter track is even more solid. The foundation is divided into four layers, with large stones at the bottom, followed by small pebbles. The first and second layers consist of coarse and fine cinder ash. Therefore, it is extremely flat and firm. Moreover, there are hidden ditches along the edges of the track, allowing rainwater to flow smoothly away, so the track does not retain water after rain and can continue to be used for competitions. The foundations for various preliminary competition fields are also being excavated, including three basketball courts, one football and baseball field each, as well as volleyball and tennis courts, which will be completed soon.</p>
<p>The sanitation and electrical engineering projects within the track and field arena have been tendered to contractors successively, and the Zhenxingcheng Company won the bids and contracted the work. They are now starting installation separately. As for the location of the swimming pool, no decision has been made yet. Originally, it was considered difficult to build due to the financial constraints of Hebei Province, and there is no suitable swimming pool in Tianjin City. The Beining Garden swimming pool, which had already taken shape, has also been abandoned due to a decision to cease construction. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee has turned its attention to Beiping, intending to negotiate renting swimming pools within the city. However, rumors of borrowing the one in Zhongnanhai were dismissed after clarification, due to concerns about water cleanliness. It is now rumored that they intend to borrow the one inside Tsinghua University, so there are many conflicting stories. When the reporter interviewed Deputy Secretary-General Zhao Wenzao, he said that the North China Sports Federation plans to convene a temporary meeting in Beiping in the coming days to resolve the swimming pool issue. The grandstand of the sports field is expected to be fully completed by the end of July, and then the interior of the field and the grandstand will be arranged. In total, all the work can be completed within a month.</p>
<h3>Internal Preparations</h3>
<p>Since the 18th North China Sports Meet Preparatory Committee was formally established in the spring of this year, it has been attached to the glass hall of the Department of Education as an office location. For months, the construction of the venue and the creation of the budget for the games have taken up all the time, so internal preparations have not been very active. Since last month (May), there have been prototypes, and with the games approaching, all preparations should be started. Therefore, on May 13th at 3:00 PM, the fourth plenary session of the Standing Committee was convened in the meeting hall of the Hebei Provincial Government. In addition to setting the date for the groundbreaking ceremony, five divisions were established, including Competition, Prizes, Performances, National Arts, and Publicity. The heads and deputy heads of each division were also determined. The draft budget for the games, amounting to 510,000 yuan, was also presented for discussion at the meeting. After discussion, due to the severe financial difficulties of Hebei Province, it was difficult to bear this huge sum. Therefore, Yuan Dunli, Zhao Wenzao, and eight other members were selected as review committee members to carefully review the budget and strive for economy. As a result of the review, the budget was reduced to 400,000 yuan (including 30,000 yuan for land purchase), which was approved at the fifth Standing Committee meeting on May 31st. At the same time, it was decided that from the 20th of this month (June), all established divisions would officially move to the office in the venue to work. It is reported that the Preparatory Committee is scheduled to convene the sixth Standing Committee meeting around the 20th of this month to discuss various important ongoing matters. The recent preparations of the established divisions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Competition Division) The head of the division is Li Youzhen, and the deputy head is Chen Wenhuan. Li is the director of physical education at Luhe Middle School in Tongzhou. He came to Tianjin at the end of last month and has now begun work. The entry instructions for the games and the instructions for athletes, such as the instructions for unit team leaders, are now ready. (National Arts Division) The head of the division is Xu Lanzhou, director of the Hebei Provincial National Arts Hall, and the deputy head is Wei Mingchu, president of the Industrial College. Wei has requested to resign from the position due to his busy schedule. The Preparatory Committee is currently trying to retain him. (Prizes Division) The head of the division is Sun Shutang, and the deputy head is Wang Fasan. Wang was previously in charge of the prizes division of the National Games and is enthusiastic and experienced. Sun is the Director of Academic Affairs of the Department of Education and has now resigned. Candidates for the position have not yet been determined. (Publicity Division) The head of the division is Tong Yaohua, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, and the deputy head is Zhang Xuan. Zhang is the chief of the third section of the Department of Education and has now resigned. There is no successor. The division is currently rushing to produce the sports manual and preparing a special issue to expand publicity. The heads and deputy heads of the Reception Division, Yin Zuying and Xu Yi, are both officials of the Department of Education and have also resigned. However, the division has not yet done any work.</p>

<h3>Zhi Ren Yong Girls' Middle School Volleyball Team Defeats Min Li Girls' Middle School</h3>
<p>▲A Ratio of Three to Two</p>
<p>The volleyball team of Zhi Ren Yong Girls' Middle School in this city has recently competed with various schools and has won every time. The school's reputation has greatly increased and it is known as an unexpected force that is invincible. Last month, the school's achievements were that it defeated China Women's Physical Education College, Patriotic Women's Physical Education College, and Biwen Girls' Middle School. Even Wu Ben, which is famous for volleyball in Shanghai, was defeated miserably by a score of three to zero. Therefore, the school often receives letters from various schools requesting competitions to happily determine the winner. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the school competed with Min Li Girls' Middle School. The two teams were evenly matched, so both sides fought fiercely. The defenders were skilled and the attackers were brave. After a fierce battle, the first set was lost. In the second set, the school reorganized its forces and attacked hard, while the opposing side was exhausted and unable to hold on, losing successively. Judging from the two teams' ball skills, Zhi Ren Yong was more skilled, so the result was a score of three to two, and the school won again.</p>

<h3>Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The conference first held an expanded memorial week at 8:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Niu Changyao. Qiu Youzhen, a member of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a speech on "The Three Principles of the People and People's Education." Then, at 9:00 AM, the opening ceremony was held.

Niu Tisheng, the founder of the Provincial Yu Tang People's Education Hall, as well as Jin Tigan, Pan Zhongjia, and Wang Hongwen, gave speeches successively. The ceremony ended at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Niu Changyao's report stated that although the social education comrades in the Sixth District have been engaged in social education, they have not been able to gather and discuss frequently due to time constraints and regional separation. Recently, the Department of Education formulated measures for provincial social education institutions to guide social education in various counties, dividing Jiangsu Province into six districts, each with a designated provincial people's education hall to be responsible for guidance, and stipulating measures for district social education research conferences to seek the development of social education. This district includes the former seven counties of Songjiang and the three counties of Jiabao Tai, a total of ten counties. Each county is close to the coast. At a time when the situation in the Pacific Ocean is becoming increasingly dangerous, we cannot continue to sing high-sounding tunes. We should quickly plan and jointly seek to promote society in order to revive the nation. This conference focuses on livelihood education, and at the same time, a joint achievement exhibition of livelihood education in ten counties is held. We hope to take this opportunity to pool our wisdom, learn from each other's strengths, and discuss effective measures to alleviate the current crisis of the country and increase the people's productive power.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Speeches</h3>
<p>Wu Jianzhen, representative of the Provincial Department of Education, stated that the development of social education can be divided into three stages: (1) the trial period, (2) the implementation period, and (3) the popularization period. The current situation of social education in Jiangsu Province is stagnating in the plateau period, which is the key to the transition from the second period to the third period. It is hoped that everyone will work hard to overcome this difficult period in order to achieve popularization. To improve social education, it is necessary to have (1) a sound organization, (2) solid work, (3) economical expenses, (4) political and educational unity, and (5) society as the base. Qiu Youzhen, representative of the Provincial Party Committee, said that he had some feelings about the unity of politics and education. Looking at the past history, political officials were less responsible in the past, and the progress of local undertakings did not rely on politics, but was the responsibility of local people such as clan leaders and gentry. Now that the feudal system has collapsed and local leaders have shaken, these people have lost their position, so the improvement of local undertakings has also lost its center. Many undertakings are then handled by local authorities, but political facilities are entirely based on their political foundation. If we want to improve local politics, those engaged in social education should find ways to transfer the political foundation to the people, so that all government measures should meet the needs of the people, and local undertakings can make progress.</p>
<h3>Niu's Speech</h3>
<p>Niu Tisheng's speech stated that social education is a term that exists in all countries, but social education in our country is different from that in other countries. It is close to adult education and is the work of awakening the people during the political tutelage period. Today's conference participants are from ten counties, which are located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the Shanghai Concession, and are the seaports below the capital and the wealthy areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Their importance is greater than that of other provinces. At a time when the national crisis is imminent, the people of our ten counties should work harder to develop the country's wealth and strength, especially for the promotion of medicine, the implementation of technical studies, and the encouragement of young people to receive military knowledge, which are important tasks of livelihood education. We should study and plan implementation according to the needs of the times in order to revive the nation.</p>
<h3>Review of Proposals</h3>
<p>This conference received more than 100 proposals, which were divided into four groups: livelihood education group, health education and language education group, conference affairs group, and special group. Each group appointed more than ten review committee members to hold group review proposal committees from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM. At 4:00 PM, they visited the livelihood education achievement exhibition, and tea and snacks were provided by the Maqiao District Office, Farmers' Education Hall, and other institutions. At 7:00 PM, the China Education Film Promotion Office showed educational films and various comedies to add to the fun.</p>
<h3>Livelihood Exhibition</h3>
<p>In addition to the Yu Tang People's Education Hall holding a horticultural exhibition, a spring-ripened agricultural product exhibition, a cooperative business exhibition, and a women's product exhibition yesterday and today, a joint exhibition of livelihood education achievements in ten counties was held at Maqiao Qiangshu Primary School. Each county displayed in one room, with products divided into agricultural products, handicrafts, specimens, charts, photographs, and other items, totaling more than 2,000 items. Taicang had many handicrafts, Qingpu had many agricultural products, and Shanghai Jiading had many local cloths. The production work models of Songjiang and the salt-making sequence and small models of agricultural tools of Fengxian were quite exquisite.</p>
<h3>Today's Order</h3>
<p>From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, Professor Yu Qingtang of the Provincial Education College will be invited to give a speech. The research conference will begin at 9:00 AM. The meeting will continue from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the afternoon. The closing ceremony will be held at 5:30 PM. A public banquet will be held by the Shanghai Party and government agencies at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Run Summer Scout Training Class</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education to Partially Rectify Peiping University</h3>
<p>▲Each College Not to Be Merged, High School Has a Saying That Postpones Suspension</p>
<p>▲School Affairs Meeting to Set Up Administrative Committee to Rectify Education</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: Xu Songming, President of Peiping University, went to Beijing to consult with the Ministry of Education on various outstanding cases and the continued operation of the high school. The Ministry of Education convened a discussion meeting on the rectification of Peiping University to discuss and resolve the various issues of the school. In principle, a decision has been largely made. Xu returned to Peiping by the Pinghu train at noon the day before yesterday because his mission had ended. According to an interview with Xu today, after I arrived in Beijing, I submitted the following four principles for the rectification of Peiping University to the Ministry of Education: (1) Seek rectification based on the current situation of Peiping University, and the organization should not be changed; (2) Strive for unified authority; (3) Rectify education and affairs in stages, first rectify education in the first stage, and then rectify affairs next year; (4) Continue to operate the high school for one year. I believe that the rectification of Peiping University must first start with the unification of authority. The Ministry of Education's position on this point is consistent with mine. The internal colleges of Peiping University are independent, so if the authority is not unified, orders cannot be implemented and the entire school's education policy cannot be promoted. If it is possible, I strongly advocate that the colleges of Peiping University be merged into one place. Moreover, a school has its historical evolution, and it is impossible to fundamentally overthrow everything in the past to carry out rectification. Only by seeking partial rectification under the current situation can there be a way. If the facts are ignored and major changes are made, it will be easy to destroy but difficult to build. Regarding the internal rectification of Peiping University, negotiations with the Ministry of Education began on the 7th of this month, and a total of several negotiations have been conducted. In general, there have been results. Director Huang (Jianzhong) of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education instructed Yu to return to Peiping first. If there is a major reform, I must be notified before the order is issued. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly stated to me that there will be no major changes in Peiping University next year (such as the merger of colleges), but small reforms (such as the merger of departments and duplicate courses within a college) are inevitable, and I am invited to submit rectification opinions for mutual discussion. The position of President of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences has not yet been determined since Fan Wenlan resigned. My opinion is to look for someone in a transcendent way. The enrollment matters for the next semester will be handled by the Peiping University Office. At present, the routine affairs of the college are handled by the secretary on behalf of the president, so there is no difficulty. Regarding the high school issue, the Ministry of Education advocates suspending it if it can be suspended, and if it cannot be suspended, there is still room for accommodation. After the current class of students graduates, no more students will be enrolled. It seems that the Ministry of Education has no longer insisted on suspending it. I conveyed this idea to the students, and the students were very satisfied with this, so the students' idea of petitioning to Beijing has been dispelled. Peiping University plans to establish an appointment committee next year to preside over the appointment of faculty and staff of various colleges of Peiping University. The president and deans of the colleges are ex officio members, and there are also representatives of professors participating. The organizational regulations of this appointment committee have been approved by the school affairs meeting. The date of establishment has not yet been determined, and the members have not been hired. The Ministry of Education's opinion on the method of rectifying Peiping University is slightly different from mine. The Ministry of Education advocates a thorough rectification at one time, which is different from my method of rectifying in stages. My method of rectifying in stages has about six points in education: (1) Professors' part-time teaching shall not exceed the original number of hours; (2) Professors' part-time positions shall not be paid; (3) Increase professors and reduce lecturers; (4) Increase professors' salaries; (5) Reorganize the curriculum and reduce hours; (6) Revise and unify various forms in the service. The above six points will be discussed with the deans of the colleges within a few days. The affairs will be carried out one year later because it is more difficult to carry out both sides at the same time. Because the spirit of 23 years is concentrated on the rectification of education, it will be necessary to rectify affairs next year.</p>
<h3>Ding Wenjiang Arrives at Academia Sinica to Take Office</h3>

While not considered few, given the large number of specialists in our society, only about 50 theses were submitted in a year, which is insufficient to fully demonstrate our capabilities. Therefore, we aim for more than 100 theses this year. We hope the thesis committee will work hard to solicit submissions, and we recommend Chu Coching (Chairman), Zhang Jingyue, Xie Jiarong, He Heng, Cao Liangxia, Mao Yisheng, Gu Yiqun, Ye Qisun, and Wang Jiaji as the nine members of the thesis committee. (3) The lectures at this year's annual meeting should be well-organized in advance. A systematic lecture program should be planned for science education, and several specialized lectures on production and national defense should also be held. Hu Hsien (Chairman), He Lu, Yan Jici, Yang Shaozeng, Wu Xianwen, Qin Renchang, Hu Boyuan, Chen Qinghua, and Zhang Yanxiang are publicly recommended as the nine members of the lecture committee. (4) Hu Buchen proposed that in recent years, various specialized academic societies have gradually been established, but initially, there was no connection between them. Our society, being the largest academic society in the country, encompassing various disciplines, has the position to connect various specialized societies. Dr. Amadeus W. Grabau, a member of our society, has repeatedly proposed to emulate the British and American Associations for the Advancement of Science by inviting one or two other specialized societies to hold concurrent meetings during our annual meeting each year to jointly discuss specific issues. This year, the Chinese Botanical Society intends to join our annual meeting for the first time, and the Chinese Zoological Society also plans to hold its inaugural meeting during our annual meeting. We ask for a public vote on whether to approve this. It was resolved to organize the society's shareholding methods on one hand and to contact and connect with other specialized societies on the other hand, and the two societies of botany and zoology were welcomed to join the fourth annual meeting. (5) Liu Chuan, Fang Xizhou, and Lu Baogan were approved as general members.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Health Movement</p>
<h3>Introduction to the Special Issue on the 13th Health Movement Editor Hu Changzhi</h3>
<p>What is a special issue? It obtains the words of a knowledgeable and respected scholar to prevent and reverse decline. It has been a long time since deviant and improper language has been rectified. When those in authority act, they suppress strangeness and promote the supreme standard. Between speaking and remaining silent, the rise and fall are determined, so how can we not be careful? There are many discussions on the health movement. Some are superficial and frivolous, others are overly critical, with elaborate arguments and chaotic debates, which are neither insightful nor heedful. The grand and accomplished ones are here in groups, providing an introduction to start the discussion.</p>
<h3>Proclamation to All Citizens for the 13th Health Movement</h3>
<p>— Li Ting'an</p>
<p>Public health, in simple terms, is to prevent people from getting sick. However, in a more advanced sense, it not only eliminates diseases and allows individuals to enjoy a long life, but also makes life enjoyable and interesting, and increases the efficiency of work. For the country, the mortality rate has been reduced, and unnecessary economic losses have been avoided. With the efficiency of work increasing, the regular benefits of production will inevitably be doubled. This is why public health is one of the most important policies of modern countries. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, with the intention of doing great things for the nation and the people through rectifying the mind and making the will sincere. He uniquely cited hygiene and cleanliness as the gateway to virtue. Is this simply seeking personal well-being in seclusion?</p>
<h3>A Recent Photograph of Mayor Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<p>[Picture]</p>
<p>Or is there a deep concern? Therefore, many people in the city have said that expanding the health movement must be held in a timely manner. Thus, the Municipal Health Bureau convened 26 government agencies and organizations below the Municipal Government to form the Preparatory Committee for the 13th Health Movement. After more than a month of planning and operation, it was finally completed. The committee members spoke candidly and comprehensively, providing a thorough and well-informed discussion. The health, public works, and police departments of the two concessions also cooperated sincerely to assist each other. Ting'an is ashamed, but also pleased with the cooperation between Chinese and foreigners. Some have said that in order to enable the government to concentrate its efforts and the public to focus its attention, the publicity center of this health movement is determined to be five points: 1. Spitting must develop good habits. 2. Urination must use the toilet. 3. Garbage must be dumped into the trash can. 4. Drinking water must be boiled. 5.</p>
<h3>Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting'an</h3>

<p>Receive immunization injections. Although they are small good deeds, being able to do them is enough. Everything has a beginning and an end, and the order of events must be known. Not only that, but the public has been indifferent to hygiene and cleanliness for a long time, and the concept of hygiene has disappeared. However, if you want to establish a concept, it cannot be effective through direct indoctrination. It must first be preceded by changes in daily life and guidance on specific behaviors. The above five central points are the keys. When the concept is solidified in the future, it will naturally develop from this, and all the sanitary habits that the government wants the people to strictly implement will be like water flowing downwards, and it will advance a thousand miles without having to be dredged! The revitalization of the national economy and the uplift of the national spirit can be expected and awaited. The new life, is it here? Is it here?</p>
<h3>Report on the Preparation Process of the 13th Shanghai Health Movement</h3>
<p>The Health Movement in this city has been held for many years, but it is always regrettable that it is widespread. This spring, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the people with the New Life, and health and cleanliness are in line with its principles. Therefore, it is believed that planned steps can be taken to open a new era in the Health Movement, and there is a plan to expand the organization. The participating agencies and organizations convened include the Secretariat of the Municipal Government, the Public Security Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Health and Public Works Departments of the Public Concession, the Health and Public Works Departments of the French Concession, the Seaport Quarantine Office, the Health Departments of the Two Railway Lines, the YMCA and YWCA, the China Benevolent Child Association, the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, the Shanghai Medical Association, the Pharmaceutical Society of the Republic of China, the Puyi Society, the Shanghai Journalists Association, the Youth Propaganda Group, and the Shanghai Dental Association. The Preparatory Committee was organized, and the assistance of the Police Department of the Public Concession, the Police Department of the French Concession, the Security Department, and the Boy Scout Council was also requested. A representative meeting was held at the Qingnianhui on Sichuan Road on the 7th of the month to pass the articles of association and elect standing committee members to organize the standing committee. Seven groups were set up to handle affairs, including general affairs, publicity, inspection, epidemic prevention, tuberculosis prevention, and cleaning. The groups held separate meetings to formulate plans, which were submitted to the standing committee for approval and actively implemented. The date of the conference was set for 10:30 AM on the 19th of this month and lasted for one week. The exhibition venue was divided into five locations and held simultaneously, namely Pudong New Village, Hudong Commune, Huxi New Village, Puyi Society, and Tianhou Palace Shuji Elementary School. The publicity outline has also been drafted. In order to unify and concentrate efforts, it was resolved that the publicity center of this session should be five: 1. Spitting must be done in a safe place. 2. Urination must use the toilet. 3. Garbage must be dumped into the trash can. 4. Drinking water must be boiled. 5. Receive immunization injections. Since the Health Department of the Two Concessions sent personnel to attend the meetings upon invitation, they also provided assistance and worked together sincerely. Many hospitals are willing to participate in the work at the time, and more than 30 have formally notified the preparatory committee. However, since the scope has been expanded and the content has been enriched, the required expenses are more than in the past. Even with extreme savings, it is impossible without 4,600 yuan. In addition to the subsidy fee of 800 yuan from the Dental Association and the income from advertising at the exhibition, which is about 800 yuan, there is still 3,000 yuan that must be subsidized by the Municipal Government. The articles of association of the preparatory committee, the minutes of the standing committee meetings, the work outline of each group, and the budget are attached for reference.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the 13th Shanghai Health Movement</h3>
<p>I. The Significance of the Health Movement</p>
<p>The Health Movement has been widely implemented in China for a long time, but the significance of its location is still little known. Although it is said that the quibbles of theory are irrelevant to practice, and the ignorance of the people depends on enlightenment. The Health Movement, from the surface point of view, is indeed a temporary excitement, but its subtle purpose lies in continuous and lasting, enduring over time without weakening. It is only to start it and benefit from its potential that there must be this temporary excitement to guide it. It is like a machine, when it is still, it is heavy and clumsy, and it is almost impossible to get one wheel and one tooth to turn. However, the person who starts the machine puts his hand on the mechanism, and with the effort of a single pull, it is like a river breaking its banks or a mountain collapsing, and its momentum cannot be restrained. There is no need to borrow hands from others. Therefore, continuous operation and spinning like a fly depend on the function of the machine itself, and with one finger pulled, ten thousand wheels move. How can it be viewed only from the surface and said to be just a temporary drumming? Therefore, although public health cannot be separated from a temporary health movement, the Health Movement is the starting point of all public health undertakings. The two have the use of mutual generation and succession and cannot be ignored. Why should we despise the Health Movement as superfluous?</p>
<p>II. The Mission of This Health Movement</p>
<p>However, the Health Movement cannot be expected with extravagance. It must be realistic, from near to far, from small to large, and not worry about the day of success. Therefore, although the Health Movement is held only once a year, its step-by-step plan never loses its consistent spirit. The city of Shanghai has had a Health Movement for twelve sessions. Colleagues have searched their hearts and asked themselves, and cannot help but have the regret of yesterday's mistakes. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, cautiously aiming high and avoiding emptiness as a warning. The customs were moved, and the stubborn became honest and the cowardly became strong. Colleagues were uneasy about their calculations, so they were panicked and agreed that this Health Movement should strive for practicality, re-establish the foundation, be careful, and dare to use every word and deed as the foundation for the revival of the nation. All the matters held by this Health Movement are not for paving the way or for popularizing customs, but for a long-term and practical return. The thorough implementation of public health should not be limited to high aspirations, and the revival of the nation has a long way to go. I also wish to use today's progress as the foundation for ten thousand years!</p>
<p>III. The Center of This Health Movement</p>
<p>The Health Movement has its own continuous steps, as mentioned earlier. This Health Movement should also mark its unique center: 1. Spitting must be done in a safe place. 2. Urination must use the toilet. 3. Receive immunization injections. 4. Garbage must be dumped into the trash can. 5. Drinking water must be boiled. The evil of small things, such as spitting, urinating, and dumping garbage, will not be corrected, and it is enough to cause</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Fire. And the goodness of small things, such as the thorough implementation of the above five items, how can it not affect the future of the country and the nation? The new life begins here, and the meaning of the movement is obtained here. Taking this as the center is probably close to the fundamental affairs.</p>
<p>IV. The Expectations of This Health Movement</p>
<p>The rise of the country has its own origins, and the signs of good fortune are often in the people. Any movement has its own individual function, and national development has its only goal. Colleagues are holding the Health Movement. During this movement, there is a need for the sincere cooperation of the people. We earnestly pray and hope that our people will work together after the movement, which is boundless. This is the declaration to show the great righteousness forever.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Thirteenth Health Movement Congress's Public Announcement</h3>
<p>Dear Compatriots: The situation is critical! Our nation's physical weakness is unparalleled in the world. Although the reasons are complex, the encroachment of tuberculosis is one of the biggest causes. Therefore, we must inform our compatriots about the issue of tuberculosis. Our country has always been a nation with backward health knowledge.</p>
<p>Ninety-eight percent of adult men and women are already threatened by tubercle bacilli. Those with strong vitality may be able to resist, but unfortunately, most of our weak nation has frail physiques and mediocre vitality. Therefore, they surrender once attacked by tubercle bacilli. Can we even imagine such a situation for our country? Thus, the current situation is indeed a critical juncture for our nation's survival and cannot be taken lightly. According to recent statistics, the world's tuberculosis mortality rate, per 100,000 people, is: New Zealand 51, Egypt 72, the United States 79, Germany 86, England 102, Spain 136, Italy 148, France 175, Japan 186, but our country's tuberculosis mortality rate reaches 400. From this, we can see that our country's tuberculosis mortality rate is eight times that of New Zealand, six times that of Egypt and the United States, five times that of Germany, four times that of England, three times that of Spain, and twice that of Italy, France, and Japan. What makes us even more afraid is that if one out of every ten people suffers from the disease, then out of every 100,000 people, there should be 4,000 people with tuberculosis. With China's population of 400 million, there should be 16 million people with tuberculosis. In other words, one in every twenty-five people in China must have tuberculosis. The number of tuberculosis patients who die in our country each year is no less than 1.6 million. There are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour, for a total of 525,600 minutes in a year. Three people die every minute, and thirty people die every ten minutes. Furthermore, our country currently has 16 million tuberculosis patients, and each person is responsible for spreading tubercle bacilli to an average of ten people. Then, within a year, our country will</p>
<p>easily produce 160 million weaklings. With each passing year, our entire nation will, in the shortest period, be plunged into an incurable and tragic state. Therefore, our country's tuberculosis situation is becoming increasingly serious, far exceeding the bombing by Japanese warplanes and the naval blockade. If we do not take preventive measures early, provide remedial treatment for those already infected, and implement anti-tuberculosis education for those not yet infected, then not only will the label of "Sick Man of East Asia" not be erased, but the very lifeline of our nation will also be severed completely. Witnessing this situation, we have united with comrades from all walks of life to organize an anti-tuberculosis association, ready to fight against this great enemy that is destroying our nation. We sincerely hope that our compatriots can learn how to prevent it. The prevention methods are as follows: (1) Develop regular and good hygiene habits to resist tubercle bacilli. (Clothing, food, housing, transportation, sleep, and work should all be regular and hygienic). (2) Participate in moderate physical exercise according to individual needs. (3) Get plenty of sunlight and breathe fresh air. (4) Isolate patients to prevent the spread of tubercle bacilli. (5) Get physical examinations. (6) Provide appropriate care for those who are already sick. If we can do this, then tubercle bacilli will have no way to invade, diseases will not multiply, the nation will be healthy, and the country will gradually become strong.</p>
<p>Cleanliness and hygiene are the foundation of health. Only a healthy population can revive the nation.</p>

<h3>On the Construction of Popular Literature</h3>
<p>— Chen Wangdao</p>
<p>In the history of Chinese literature, written language has been very complex. Simply put, it can be divided into the following table:</p>
<p>Aristocratic Language (Classical Chinese)</p>
<p>Written Language　　Civilian Language (Vernacular)　　Clerical Language (Sayings Style)　　　　　　　　　　　Popular Language (Used in "Pinghua" in the Song Dynasty)</p>
<p>The debate about written language during the "Literary Revolution" era around the May Fourth Movement was a debate between civilian language and aristocratic language. At that time, the written language that fought for civil rights against classical Chinese included both clerical language and popular language. Moreover, the two languages were often treated equally, leaving a possibility of retreating into the sayings style. This was a shortcoming at the time. However, the reason why clerical language and popular language were treated equally at that time was only because the urgent situation of confronting classical Chinese forced them to appear that way. In essence, it was not taking the sayings style as a model. Compared with everything else before that always centered on the sayings style in theory or in practice, this must be said to be a strength at the time. Now, Mr. Chen Zizhan's proposal of popular language can be said to have absorbed the strengths of that time and abandoned the shortcomings of that time. I think everyone will agree.</p>
<p>However, there may still be room for discussion and research regarding the nature of popular language. Mr. Zizhan only proposed listening, seeing, and speaking as standards. I think this is not enough. Writing must also be considered. The simplification of writing has been studied by many people in recent years, and it is also a phenomenon of progress. It seems that people who study literature in the future cannot but pay attention to research. In the future, the vocabulary of popular language will inevitably have foreign words imported, but it must be written in Chinese characters to pronounce its sound so that everyone can say it. According to past experience, importing some foreign words or using some classical words does not feel very inconvenient to the public as long as they are indeed necessary for the public at that time. Such as "modern," "motor," "ice cream," "procedure," "extradition," and the like. These vocabularies actually change from time to time, and changing them is actually not as difficult as changing grammar. However, it must not violate the conditions that the public can say, understand, write smoothly, and see</p>
<p>clearly to be called popular language.</p>
<p>The cultivation of popular language can only rely on ordinary times, not on temporary times. All rules and all coercion, when entangled in the mind temporarily, will hinder the free expression of writing. Unnatural traces appear on the written text. This is even more true in novels, poems, dramas, and other texts that describe concrete images. Therefore, here, the issue arises that to construct popular literature, one must actually approach the public and learn language from the public. It is difficult to become a popular language writer by simply hiding in the study without approaching the public, or by approaching the public without paying attention to their language.</p>
<p>The language of the masses is indeed worth learning, especially grammar. In many places, it has become more neat, more ingenious, and more natural than classical Chinese. For example, the so-called use of solid words as empty words and empty words as solid words, which the Tongcheng School painstakingly advocated, is just a hard use of words in classical Chinese, such as "Rain desires King Wu me?" and "Spring breeze breezes people." There is no definite method in grammar that can help, so it feels very unnatural to read, let alone to say. However, in the spoken language of the masses, there is a definite way of saying it. To use an empty word as a solid word, you can add a suffix of a solid word like "tou." For example, if you want to use the word "think" as a solid word, you can say "thought" and the like. To use a solid word as an empty word, there are also similar methods. You can add words such as "le," "zhe," "qi," "xia," "qu," and "lai." For example, if you want to use words such as "car" and "bag" as empty words, you can say "carred away" and "bagged away" and the like. This kind of progress in language should certainly be learned. However, literature is not just about language. All literature needs to know how to see reality, and seeing reality requires a certain attitude. The cultivation of attitude is actually more important than the cultivation of language. Some language problems also need to be selected and decided from an attitude.</p>
<p>There are many problems to be solved in constructing popular language literature, and everyone needs to discuss them carefully.</p>
<h3>Each to the Best of Their Ability</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>It is truly fortunate to be born in China today. There are so many things waiting for us to do, whether it is creating, criticizing, translating, or researching. If we can each do our best, there are many things we can do.</p>
<p>"Know Thyself," I think this is a golden rule for life. Perhaps it is also due to age, but I now feel that the four words "each to the best of their ability" can greatly help our work efficiency.</p>
<p>When young, one sometimes likes to sing high tunes, which is very Romantic. Reaching for the sky and being far from reality, in the end, nothing is achieved. Empty dreams bear no fruit. Rather than that, it is better to narrow the scope and earnestly do something small.</p>
<p>I am not saying that men of letters should not have unrestrained aspirations. Aspirations are needed. I am not saying that men of letters should not have great ambitions. Ambition is a driving force. However, unattainable aspirations and ambitions hinder work. I believe that rather than that, it is better to assess one's virtue and ability and do one's best.</p>
<p>"Know Thyself" Self-knowledge is necessary. Some people may as well go from the ivory tower to the crossroads, while it is also necessary for others to work in the research laboratory of a major science. There is more than one road to Rome. Studying the ancient and studying the modern can reach the same conclusions. One can succeed in any field and do one's best in that field.</p>
<p>In the past, I expressed dissatisfaction with some registered researchers of national literature. I always thought that kind of ledger-style research and list-style textual research could not become historical research. Now, I feel that that kind of thinking is wrong. Those list-style textual research, although they do not become history, at least become historical materials. If their textual research is accurate, then they have also fulfilled a great task.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "One shovel cannot dig a well." If someone wants to compile a good history of literature, they must have rich and accurate materials as a basis. If someone cannot build a house but can lay a good foundation, his contribution is not small. As long as he is faithful to his work, then we should pay our respects to him.</p>
<p>I say: People should each do their best. If someone has the ability but does not do their best, they deserve to die ten thousand times. For example, if someone's English is very good but they do not translate English and American literature and instead take a shortcut to indirectly translate French literature, this is not good. Because indirect translation is a slippery way. If it is unavoidable, it can be permitted. However, avoiding difficulties and seeking ease is not allowed. If someone has the talent for criticism but does translation because it is less effort, it is also not allowed. The main point of each doing their best lies in the word "best."</p>
<p>Without a deep understanding of something, one always thinks that that thing is easy to do. Some people say that Western literature is easier to study than Chinese literature. In fact, it is not. He probably still doesn't realize the trouble. For example, if someone who understands English does not introduce Dos Passos but introduces André Gide, that is one example. This kind of example either shows that the introducer's understanding is not deep or shows that he is a bit high-pitched. I believe that when introducing a writer, one must at least read several of his representative works. Otherwise, you will make a mistake and not even know it. This kind of unrealistic introducer is better than someone who only talks about principles and formulas and ignores the facts, but since they are both talkers, can we say that they are doing their best? They are not without talent, so why don't they develop their strengths?</p>
<p>Know Thyself! Each to the best of their ability! In China today, we need to do something practical. Do some silly things! Empty talk is enough to mislead the country.</p>
<h3>The Five Vidyas and the Three Illuminations</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>The Panchen Erdeni recently gave a speech somewhere, elaborating on the Five Vidyas, but it was not detailed. One reason was that the translator was not accurate, and the other was that the reporter was ignorant, which turned the obvious meaning into "inconceivable." Therefore, this article is written to dispel public confusion.</p>
<p>The Great Tang Records of the Western Regions was written by the Buddhist monk Xuanzang, commonly known as the Tang Monk. The Tang Monk went to the "Western Paradise"!! That is, India!! To "obtain scriptures" and learn the Great Vehicle Yoga Treatise from the Dharma Master Jie Xian. In fact, seeking the Dharma at that time was no different from studying abroad today. The purpose of studying is to ask about the Tao, and the purpose of asking about the Tao is to consult a teacher. Ancient Greece had the famous Solon studying abroad, and Europe and the West still have the custom of studying abroad today. Many famous monks in ancient Japan also came to Tang to study, but they were just here to study.</p>
<p>What is valuable is that these many Dharma seekers also introduced various local customs from foreign countries. For example, in the Great Tang Records of the Western Regions, there is a passage recording Indian education:</p>
<p>"After the age of seven, they are gradually taught the Five Vidyas:</p>
<p>The first is Shabda-vidya: explaining words and characters, interpreting categories and distinctions.</p>
<p>The second is Shilpa-vidya: techniques and mechanisms, yin and yang calendrical calculations.</p>
<p>The third is Chikitsa-vidya: incantations, medicine, acupuncture, and moxibustion.</p>
<p>The fourth is Hetu-vidya: examining what is right, studying what is true and false.</p>
<p>The fifth is Adhyatma-vidya: thoroughly explaining the five vehicles, the wonderful principles of cause and effect...</p>
<p>The teacher must be well-versed in subtleties, thoroughly understand mysteries, show great meanings, guide with subtle words, encourage and guide, and encourage the decadent.</p>
<p>If one has the most intelligent knowledge and lofty aspirations, then they are bound by rules and regulations. After the course is completed, they are thirty years old, and their ambition is established. !!</p>
<p>After taking a position, they first repay the teacher's virtue. Those who are well-read and elegant, live in seclusion, remain steadfast, float outside the world, roam beyond clothing, are not surprised by honor or disgrace, and their reputation is far away. The king admires them and cannot make them bend.</p>
<p>However, the country values intelligence and numbers, and the customs value high understanding. Praise is high, and gifts are abundant. Therefore, they can strengthen their will, study diligently, forget fatigue, travel widely, seek the Way, rely on benevolence, and not fear the distance. Although their families are wealthy, their aspirations are the same as travelers. They beg for food to survive. They value knowing the Way and are not ashamed of being poor." ... From this, it seems that the Five Vidyas are just the five departments of today's university. Shabda-vidya is the humanities, including philology, phonology, literature, and the like, but once it is published in a modern newspaper, it must be "understanding bird language and knowing good and bad luck." The Panchen Lama may not have said such things. The Han people deliberately make it mysterious to confuse the ignorant people.</p>
<p>Shilpa-vidya is nothing more than engineering, including astronomy. Chikitsa-vidya is nothing more than medicine. Hetu-vidya is philosophy, and Adhyatma-vidya is religious studies. Because ancient India was still somewhat like the old society in China, education was based on private schools, emphasizing special teaching, private transmission, and study abroad. Compared with the modern academic system of the West, it was ultimately not civilized, but there was no sense of mystery.</p>
<p>Ordinary people call "the Buddha Dharma boundless," usually referring only to the breadth and depth of Indian culture. The Five Vidyas are Indian culture and the origin of Buddhism, but after the Panchen's speech, the curious flocked like clouds, thinking it was "inconceivable" again. ("Inconceivable" is different from "unspeakable," "unrepresentable in writing," and "unthinkable." Yan Jidao's explanation is the clearest, see the "Evolution and Ethics" on Buddhism.) The mistake is confusing the Five Vidyas with the Three Illuminations.</p>
<p>"Tishra-vidya" 11 is translated as "The Three Knowledges". The Great Treatise says: "Past lives, divine sight, and the extinction of outflows are called the Three Knowledges."智论问：神通与明，有何等异？答：直知过去宿命事，名通：知过去因缘行业，名明。直知死此生彼，名通：知行因缘际会不失，名明。直尽结使，不知更生不生，名通：若知漏尽更不复生，名明。（以上见翻译名义集。）</p>
<p>It is said that the Buddha fully possesses the Three Knowledges, so it is also a joke between heaven and earth and it is "inconceivable".</p>
<h3>About Woodcuts</h3>
<p>— Mengke</p>
<p>Now, young art students are mostly asking for introductions to new international works. Looking at the current publishing situation, the collections of international masters that have come out cannot be said to be few, but the more advanced, practical, and referable things for apprentices are still few in the end. Originally, introducing works of art is not an easy task. Even with paintings, if you can't bring the original works, relying solely on a few reduced photos will lose the truth, and readers will still not benefit. Mr. Lü Xun said in his article "On the Reproduction of Woodcuts": "If you reduce an elephant to the size of a pig, and a tiger to the size of a mouse," you "won't make people feel the original momentum." This is very pertinent.</p>
<p>In art, woodcuts are considered to be small pieces, except for comics. There was a time when woodcuts didn't seem to be noticed much, but now they almost occupy an important position in the international art scene. Illustrations in books are also mostly woodcuts. The strength of woodcuts is that they are carved with a knife, which is stronger than the expression of sweeping with a brush. Although they are only black and white, they are clearer than complex colored paintings, and the impression they give is particularly deep. Now, Chinese books and periodicals are also in need of this kind of woodcut illustration to add to the interest of readers and feel the lack of this kind of talent. If you want to give young people in the art world some practical reference materials, and you want to lose less of the original appearance of the original works, it is best to reproduce woodcuts for the time being. In recent years, some people have been doing this, which is very gratifying. However, we must be ashamed that the people who are responsible for this work are still one or two enthusiastic seniors in the literary world.</p>
<p>The woodcuts that have been introduced now, in addition to those scattered in various publications, also include four collections of Frans Masereel's serial woodcuts published by Liangyou, and one kind of "cement map" printed by private individuals using glass plates. For beginners, it can be considered a preliminary borrowing. Naturally, these are still things that enthusiasts have collected piecemeal. If you want to know the trend and direction of woodcuts in a country from this, it is far from enough.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I unintentionally saw a newly published "Introduction to Jade", which is a very complete collection of modern Russian woodcuts. The collection includes works by thirteen artists such as Mitrokhin. It is prefaced with an article by Kai Gedayev translated by Mr. Chen Jie, "Fifteen Years of Book Engraving and Single-Line Engraving." In the "Postscript", there are also autobiographies written by five artists including Mitrokhin for this collection. By comparing the "Preface" in the front of the book with the works of each artist in turn, we can know the process of the transition from the "Art World" to realism in Russia over the past fifty years. The different characteristics of the new and old schools can also be found from this. For example, the styles of the "Iron Stream" with decorative flavor and the rough and solid "Mother" illustrations clearly express the gap between the new and the old. Looking at the autobiography again, in addition to studying the works, we can also know a little about the life experience of each artist, which is very interesting. I think such a systematic collection of woodcuts will definitely be of greater help to beginners.</p>
<h3>Guì Yīng's Father (4)</h3>
<p>— Huá Zǐ</p>
<p>Guì Yīng's father watched her retreating figure and said, without excitement, "I want to kill you, you old woman. You can't even walk properly, hobbling along like that." As he spoke, he imitated her limping gait, which made everyone laugh. "Hmph, if it weren't for Xiǎo Yù's sake, I would have killed her long ago." Guì Yīng's father continued, "When Xiǎo Yù was alive, she often said to me, 'Dad, Mom is so pitifully ill. You have to forgive her, be more tolerant of her, and don't argue with her.' I listened to Xiǎo Yù, so I always let her have her way. ... Xiǎo Yù ... Xiǎo Yù ..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, he became dejected, lowered his eyes, and slowly picked up the second bowl of wine, taking only a small sip before putting it down. He rested his hands on the counter, not lifting his head for a minute, as if he were about to fall asleep. Those watching did not disperse because of this. Guì Yīng's father slowly raised his head, took another sip of wine, and suddenly fixed his moist eyes on me. "Oh, Mr. Xú, please, please! Haha! Old Third is so lucky. Look how gentle and honest Mr. Xú is." My wife is the third child, so Guì Yīng's father calls her Old Third. "Ah, my Xiǎo Yù is so pitiful!" He suddenly switched back to Xiǎo Yù. "Mr. Xú, Xiǎo Yù is Lé Jiànyīng, who is Guì Yīng's older brother. He was a gentle child like you. He was a revolutionary, and revolutionaries are good people, good people!" He said the words "good people" with great emphasis, as if he had to make people believe it.</p>
<p>"However, I didn't believe that revolutionaries were good people before. It was only after Xiǎo Yù became a revolutionary that I started to believe it. Mr. Xú, look at this old man. I was a soldier for many years and have been all over the place: Hángzhōu, Sūzhōu, Húnán, Húběi, Fújiàn, and Guǎngdōng. I've even been to your Shàoxīng. I can understand and speak all sorts of local dialects. I can even curse in the Shàoxīng dialect: 'Nà yī mā yī shí yī bǐ yī nóng yī gé yī táo yī shēng yī zǐ.' Isn't that right? In Hángzhōu, everything has the suffix 'ér': tóuér, nǎoér, pénér, wǎnér, huázinì, and going to the Qíxià to play zǐér. Isn't that right? Mr. Xú understands these words, but those country bumpkins who haven't seen the world don't understand them. All they know is 'gè mǔ' and 'gè yàng.' Outsiders don't say 'gè mǔ'; they say 'shénme.' Mr. Xú, am I right?"</p>
<p>When he said "they," he pointed at the onlookers outside the shop. I thought he was going to give a lecture on linguistics, but that wasn't the case. "When I was in Hángzhōu," he said, "it was right when the revolutionaries were making trouble. All I knew was that revolutionaries were rebels, and rebels were like the Taiping rebels, who deserved to be killed. We often watched revolutionaries being killed, and we were very happy. Once, I and a group of brothers caught a revolutionary, and we killed him a few days later. Unexpectedly, in the third year of the Xuantong reign, the revolutionaries won the country. In that year, I retired from the army because I was seriously ill and returned home. Later, I sold shāobǐng and sweet potato starch jelly to make a living. In my heart, even though the revolutionaries had won the country, they were still usurpers. Once the true Son of Heaven was restored, they would all be killed. Who knew that fifteen years would pass and the true Son of Heaven still hadn't appeared? The first batch of revolutionaries hadn't been wiped out, and a second batch had emerged. My Xiǎo Yù joined the party without telling me."</p>
<p>Saying this, he sighed and took another sip of wine.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: August contracts up; gold market sees many small positions; major players enter to cover; result: rebound of $3.50</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's momentum was mixed. Although spot silver shrank, only nineteen contracts were traded in two days, raising suspicions about the decrease in volume. Spot prices fell, leading to higher prices in the morning market followed by a decline. Major players covered their short positions, resulting in a stable outcome. Starting from yesterday morning, since the summer festival, overseas silver markets have seen two days of squeeze plays. Both the British and American silver markets have fallen. The forward silver price on the precious metals exchange also fell by six háo to two lì six. Exchange rates rose slightly. American cotton saw only slight fluctuations, and American wheat contracted slightly, improving market sentiment. The outside market opened higher, rising to $16.17. However, with only nineteen spot silver contracts traded, the decrease in volume raises suspicions. Anxious sellers offered eagerly, causing a slight dip. After the opening, banks became reluctant to buy, the exchange rate hardened, and spot prices were offered by many bulls, gradually moving downstream. However, the market remained mediocre, with many fluctuations in between. Although the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, banks continued to offer, and the domestic market loosened further, leading to more sellers in the market and even lower prices. Sentiment was neutral, and there was still some buying interest as prices fell. Banks took advantage of the lower prices to slightly increase their holdings, managing to pull the market up. At noon, the momentum hovered, but the underlying trend remained soft. The afternoon market opened flat. Later, with the Guang Gang covering short positions, a buying trend suddenly emerged in the market. The exchange rate also tightened as a result, and gold prices gradually rose. The market situation also stabilized, but sentiment remained calm. Therefore, although prices rose, there were many fluctuations. There was no special news during the day, so the fluctuations were generally mediocre, but the trend seemed uncertain. The price of pure gold was calculated at $1025.70, and the spot price was reversed by the bulls. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at $1015.20, an increase of $3.60 compared to the close before the holiday. Spot goods opened at the same price. Exchange rates opened with the near-term selling price for British pounds at 1 shilling 3 pence 625, and US dollars at $33. Mitsui and Wah Bi offered July US dollars at $33. Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Da Feng, Heng Tong, Yi Sen, Chang Yong, Shen Kang, etc., all sold, retreating from $5.30 to $2.80, anticipating that the HSBC exchange rate would be flat for both British pounds and US dollars. However, because Heng Yu, Ding Kang, Ri Chang, Heng Chang, and Yong took advantage of the low prices to slightly increase their holdings, the price rose back to $3.90. HSBC and Sumitomo offered August US dollars at $1.875. Spot goods were offered. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Fu An, Ying Feng, Heng Yi, Feng Yong, etc., sold together. The exchange rate loosened and hardened. Wah Yi offered July US dollars at $1.25, and Wah Bi and McCallum offered September US dollars at $3.125, gradually falling to $1.40. Fu Chang, Yu Qing, Yong, etc., worked hard to buy. HSBC lowered September US dollars to $3.125. Sentiment then weakened and slightly leveled off, gradually rising back to $3.40. Heng Yu, Zhao Feng, Chang Yuan, Mao Yong, and Yong took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the price fell again to $2.30. Finally, because Fu Chang, Yu Qing, and Yong still had buying appetite, the noon close was at $1012.60. Spot goods were offered at $2.20.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $1012.50, with spot goods opening at $2.40, then at $2.40. Shen Kang limited buying to maintain stability. After entering, with Fu Chang, Tian Feng, Yuan Mao, Yong, Tong Chun, and Yong Feng vigorously buying, the price rose to around $4. Fu, Heng Yu, Fu Xing, and Yong came up to offer, and the market remained flat. Then, Mitsui bought October US dollars at $3.75. Fu, Yu, Yuan Mao, Yong, Da De Cheng, and Yong Feng bought again vigorously, and the price rose to $4.90. Mitsui offered August US dollars at $1.25, and Yun Tong offered the same month at $1.875. Fu Chang, Fu An, Yuan Chun, Bing Xing, etc., took advantage of the high prices to sell, falling back to $3.80. However, because Yuan Mao, Yong, Fu Tai, Heng Yu, Qing Yong, Da Xing, Yong Fu, Yu Heng Xing, and Da De Cheng had strong buying interest, the price rose to $5.80. Banks were dealing with September US dollars at $0.25. Fu An, Heng Yu, Yu Qing, and Yong took advantage of the high prices to offer, falling back to within $5. After that, Yi Yu bought fiercely, resulting in many struggles, hovering around $5. The closing price extended to $1015.10, with spot goods offered at $5.20. After the close, Heng Xing entered the market to buy, and prices fell but still rose. The highest price of the day was $1015.80, and the lowest price was $1011.40, a difference of $4.40. The result was an improvement of $3.50 compared to the close before the holiday.</p>
<p>The settlement price used the HSBC Bank's US dollar exchange rate, which remained unchanged at $32.625, resulting in a standard gold price of over $1060. Judging from the closing price, approximately $45 was restrained, $3.50 less than before the Summer Festival. July accounts were registered at $1013, and August accounts at $1013. Morning make-up water was at $1013, and afternoon make-up water was at $1015. The price of pure gold was calculated at $1025.70, approximately $10.50 more. Market transactions were quiet and lacked volume. It was rumored that the Central Bank had bought 280 taels of spot goods in the morning market at a price of only $1010.50. There were a few spot transactions in the swap market, with the bulls offering $0.05, but because the Dalian gang, etc., offered lower prices, Yuan Mao and Yi Cheng came to offer $0.12, but the bulls' desire to exit was too strong, gradually leveling the mountain and making the spot price reverse to $0.05. Then, Da Kang, etc., offered to Ying Feng Heng. Subsequently, Qing Fa and Yong Yi Feng Yong offered to Ying Feng Heng, for the shorts to take in $0.07. Then, they did a spot trade offering $1, with Da De Cheng offering. Finally, many accounts were cleared and settled. As of today, there are 5,866 July strips remaining, with a total of 17 bulls and 15 shorts.</p>
<p>Market transactions: In summary, Heng Xing, Ying Feng, Heng Shun Li, Fu Chang, Fu Tai, Heng Xiang He, Tian Feng, Tong Tai, Chang Yuan, Feng Yong, Heng Xing Yuan, Da Kang, Hong Kang, Yong Yi Yu, Yuan Mao, Wan Xing, etc., were on the buying side. Bing Xing, Shen Kang, Heng Tai, Yuan Chun, Hui Xiang, Fu Xing, Yong Tong Feng, Heng Yi Cheng, De Kang, Sen Chang Yong, etc., were on the selling side. Yi Feng and Yong Fu An Hong Xing Heng Yu advanced and then exited. Yong Feng, Yuan Mao, Yong Tong Chun, Zhao Feng, Chang Da De Cheng exited and then entered. The Dalian Gang and Wan Xing did approximately 700 trades, stopping just under 100. Shun Li did approximately 800 trades, with less than 200 actually entering. The Guang Gang, Sheng Da, did not have much activity. Heng Xing entered over 900 trades, exiting dozens of trades. As of today, there are a total of 31,766 August contracts, with 36 bulls and 60 shorts. The total number of transactions on the day was 20,377 in the morning and 19,894 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Silver prices continue to shrink; exchange rates tighten for both British and American currencies</h3>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, the London market shrank by a total of 1.875 in two days, with the British pound falling by 0.25. The forward silver price fell by 2.5%. The British pound rose against the US dollar by 0.375, and the US dollar rose against the British pound by 0.25. The British pound rose against the French franc by 12 pounds, and the US dollar shrank against the French franc by half a point. The London spot gold price rose by half a penny. The private electricity silver price shrank by a total of 0.375. The ground report was dull. The exchange rate did not move and remained flat.

<h3>Opening and closing were relatively tight</h3>
<p>This year, feeling the urban and rural economic downturn, all industries are in decline. The financial sector, as the lifeblood of all industries, bears the brunt. Therefore, business conditions have been consistently sluggish for half a year. Yesterday was the first day of full opening for banks after the Dragon Boat Festival. The collections and disbursements of two or three days were sorted out in one day, so the situation seemed very complicated. However, judging from the actual business and transaction situation, it was still as sluggish as before. This shows the dismal state of the market and the misfortune of the city. Yesterday, the interbank rate in the market was slightly better than before, by two points, calculated as six points. The early morning and noon were the same, but there was no difference in the tightness or looseness of the content. Therefore, top-up transactions still prevailed, and there was still no possibility of cash spreading out after concentration. It was difficult to raise the price of top-up and water, and the market still opened at two to three points. The transaction volume of interbank notes was 4.34 million in the early market and over 400,000 in new transactions. The noon market saw over 200,000 transactions. The transaction volume in the Small General Association was over 500,000. The foreign collateral transaction took back over 900,000, and the new transaction made 1.2 to 1.3 million. The recovery and issuance of banknotes was over 2.3 million, with a customer source of 300,000. 200,000 in cash was disposed, and 300,000 in banknotes. In bank collections and disbursements, foreign banks collected and disbursed over 3.67 million in notes, and collected and disbursed over 5.23 million in various cargo exchange collaterals. Over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 2.1 million in half-year settlement accounts, and 600,000 were entered into warehouses. Chinese banks collected and disbursed over 3.9 million in notes, and collected and disbursed over 7 million in various cargo exchange tariff collaterals. Settlement collection and disbursement was over 2.89 million, and 1 million was released from warehouses. Japanese banks collected and disbursed over 3.45 million in notes, collected and disbursed over 4.89 million in various cargo exchange collaterals, and the settlement sorting amount was over 1.22 million, with 400,000 released from warehouses. Money shops collected and disbursed over 43.3 million in foreign public bills, collected and disbursed over 9.45 million in foreign top-up funds, collected over 900,000 in various routes of exchange, and collected 700,000 to 800,000 in cash. In addition, the total number of exchanges at the Clearing House on the 18th was 12,079,662.79 silver dollars, including 6,887,896.48 silver dollars and 5,191,766.31 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jiao continues to rise, Guang Jiao falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiang Jiao, due to consecutive days of sharp decline, seemed to have a turnaround. The early market was at $810, and the noon market was at $812.50. The result was a sharp increase of $9 compared to the noon market the previous day. The transaction volume was 8,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the noon market. Guang Jiao previously saw an increase, then fell again. The early market was at $735, and the noon market was at $733.20. The result was a small drop of $3.10 compared to the noon market the previous day. The transaction volume was 85,000 jiao in the early market and 25,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 330,500,000 coins, with a transaction volume of 40,651,500 coins, totaling a price of 12,300 yuan.</p>
<h3>The city's current silver outflow continues; another 1.15 million yuan exported this morning</h3>
<p>In the past three weeks, foreign banks such as HSBC, British Bank, and Chase have shipped out approximately 2.5 million yuan in current silver to England and America. The British Bank shipped out another 190 boxes of current silver, approximately 950,000 yuan, on the Dalei's Johnson liner to Hong Kong for transshipment to British Bombay. Yesterday, the bank shipped out another 40 boxes of current silver, approximately 200,000 yuan, on the Hoover Presidential liner to the United States. Both ships reportedly left this morning.</p>
<h3>Securities: Sentiment is high, bond market rises again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after two days of closure at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the bond market environment and news became increasingly favorable. The Sino-Japanese issue is unlikely to cause much conflict. The domestic political situation is becoming tighter and more unified. The financial sector is absorbing funds without reservation. It is rumored that there will be a review of the reserve funds of various bank savings departments. Short sellers are increasingly finding no way out. Apart from offsetting, there are no other tricks. The market sentiment is extremely high. The reporter predicted that the short-term gold price would reach $75, which was realized at yesterday's afternoon close. The surge was so sudden and rapid that it exceeded expectations. The strength of the trend is still unabated. The demobilization and cigarette bonds both reached new highs, but some bonds are still slightly lower than the high prices of April 9. The upward trend still has momentum, and shorting is not yet the time. Yesterday, after the opening, prices rose uniformly. The demand from various gangs was very lively. Numbers 5, 48, and 50 were all bought. The full six surged by more than $1. Other bonds also rose by $0.30 to $0.70 or $0.80, even more than $1. In the secondary market, only three or four bonds saw a slight pullback of $0.05. The remaining bonds continued to rise, again by $0.30 to $0.40. The absorption capacity of the financial sector can be seen here. The close showed no signs of weakness. The short-term gold price suddenly saw the predicted new high of $75. The salt tax is only $0.08 away from the 70% discount. Due to the crowding of short sellers, the absorption of funds by the financial sector, and the Treasury Department's review of the warehouse, bank account closures, and other factors, the upward trend is unlikely to stop temporarily. The reporter said earlier that there will be an unimaginable upward trend in the future. It is advisable to be cautious in shorting without goods. Yesterday's market results showed an increase of several angles to $1.70 or $1.80. Among public bonds, short-term gold and full six were the best. Among treasury bonds, salt tax and customs in the 22nd year were the best. In the future, short-term gold and demobilization are expected to compete side by side. Full six and short-term gold are currently $8 apart. In the future, the distance is expected to become closer and closer. We will wait and see. Yesterday's transaction volume was approximately 22 to 23 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn Market: Spot sales are active, and Marked Yarn suddenly rises</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been weak for several days, suddenly rose today, and the situation is quite tight. The Huabei region has a strong interest in buying Chinese yarn. Other gangs are also developing. There are reports that the Tianjin gang bought over 1,000 bales. It is said that Japanese yarn also sold over 1,000 bales. Therefore, sentiment is good, and sellers are lacking. The market price is rising steadily. How the future will unfold will depend on actual needs.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster rises by over 3 yuan</h3>
<p>Before the market opened for Marked Yarn, there was news that the Tianjin gang was purchasing spot yarn. As a result, there were more buyers. The market situation in the field suddenly rose, and it was reported that the Tianjin gang was buying a large amount of yarn. Therefore, prices rose steadily. Each month rose by $2.2, $2.4, $2.5, and $2.8. In the afternoon, the market remained strong. Each month rose again by $2.2, $2.4, $2.6, and $2.8.

<h3>Marked Cotton Also Trending Upwards</h3>
<p>The cotton market is also tight, but the overseas cotton market remains flat. However, the yarn market is trending upwards, sentiment is excited, and the market is rising. However, there are already over 50,000 dan delivered this month, so the market atmosphere this month is relatively flat. As for the bullish companies, their intentions remain strong. Therefore, when the situation tightens, the upward trend becomes even more intense.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Hao Rose Five to Six Jiao</h3>
<p>The opening of the cotton market was still relatively stable, not as strong as the yarn market. Indian cotton fell seven rupees the previous day, and American cotton was also stable.

<h3>Grains: Strong Buying Interest in Distant Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning, and the market for various months initially appeared stable. The price of foreign wheat has fluctuated by two or three jiao in the past two days, so the market sentiment initially appeared calm. However, the buying interest from non-industry players remained strong, and they bought regardless of price, causing the market to rise again. However, actual sales customers remained calm, so although the surface situation felt good, it was still weak at its core. By the time the afternoon market opened, the current month was mostly settlement-oriented on both sides, and the market was stable. The distant months saw the buying power of the silver and money industry remain undiminished, so the market rose again. The non-industry purchases focused on the drought in the American wheat region, believing that foreign wheat would no longer be able to come to China. Also, some factories secretly spread rumors, which led to the silver and money industry buying in. However, in terms of the actual situation, actual sales in North China showed no improvement, and the domestic new wheat harvest was another bumper year. Therefore, this kind of unconscious purchase will inevitably be impacted by the facts in the future. As a result, the current month was up a small two and a half li, July was up one fen and two and a half li, August was up one fen, September was up one fen and two and a half li, October was up one fen and seven li, and November was up seven li.</p>
<h3>Origin Market Prices Drive Up Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw the market for various months generally appear stable and promising after the morning and afternoon openings. Although the price of foreign wheat fluctuated slightly, local traders, because the new wheat harvest was good and shipments were also abundant, were eager to buy and sell after a long period of inactivity. They were buying in the producing areas and preparing to ship and sell, so the market in the producing areas inevitably rose. Therefore, the standard market also showed a slight profit. However, some inland traders were engaged in hedging sales, so the distant market has become unstable. In the future, if there is abundant rainfall on the supply side, it will definitely be smooth. On the other hand, it will depend on whether the factory's sales volume has continuity. As a result, July was up five fen, August was up two fen, September was up four fen, October was up two fen, and November was down a small one fen. The current wheat market is slightly weak, down one or two fen compared to the previous day. Because there are many arrivals on the market, both sellers and buyers are seeking to sell quickly, so the higher grades have shown a downtrend. Opening prices: Dàqiáo, Huángqiáo, Lùhé, and Gāoyōu wheat at two yuan and eight jiao; Míngguāng wheat at two yuan and nine jiao, second grade at eight jiao and eight fen; Bèngbù wheat at two yuan and nine jiao; Pǔkǒu wheat at two yuan, seven jiao and seven fen, second grade at seven jiao and a half; Línhuáiguān wheat at two yuan, eight jiao and eight fen; Cǎishízhī wheat at two yuan, seven jiao and a half, second grade at seven jiao and three fen; Hézhōu wheat at two yuan, seven jiao and three fen; Wúhú wheat at two jiao and seven jiao; Nánjīng wheat at two yuan and seven jiao; Pǔdōng wheat at two yuan and five jiao and a half; Āngāotíng wheat at two yuan, six jiao and seven fen; Pénglái wheat at two yuan and six jiao and a half; Hétóu wheat at two yuan, six jiao and nine fen; Kūnshān wheat at two yuan and seven jiao. 11,000 bags went to Fúxīn, 3,000 bags went to Fùfēng, 3,000 bags went to Huáfēng, and 2,000 bags went to Xìndà.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Has Continued to Weaken Due to Abundant Supply</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply came from over thirty suppliers (totaling over 4,500 shi), with late rice being more abundant than japonica. However, the demand from buyers was once again sluggish, so the market continued to be weak. Buyers from Beiyang, Tianjin, Weihaiwei, and Yantai have been watching from the sidelines since the market opened, and demand has been slow. A total of 1,400 to 1,500 bags of Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sisi, and Liantang goods were processed by the time the market closed, and the purchases were extremely strict. However, sellers were unwilling to accept further hard cuts due to the tight situation on this street. As a result, they were slightly reduced by several fen. The sales of various japonica varieties are still quite good, and the market is very tight. However, because the trend of late rice is downward, it is inevitably affected. Therefore, the price of goods from Changbang, Sutong, and Nangang is only slightly better by a few fen. However, as supply has become scarce due to weather changes, it has been able to recover a few fen.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, thirteen or fourteen boats arrived from various riversides. Various sales of white japonica rice on the market are still good. Early thin rice continues to move. Baiyuan and Yang Dujian are still acceptable. There are still transactions in the buke jian. The market shape is tight and high for white japonica rice by several fen, and the middle and secondary grades are good by a jiao or more. Early thin rice is firm. Baiyuan and Yang Dujian prices are close to a jiao. Buke jian high-grade material is tight and up to a jiao. The middle and secondary grades are in a firm position.</p>
<h3>After the Holiday, the Sale of Customer Xian Rice Has Gradually Become Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first market day after the holiday. The demand from our customers has become more active, especially from Fuzhou customers, who originally had strong demand. After days of holding back, the needs of various places have gradually emerged. Yesterday, they arrived at the market and were keen to buy. However, there is sufficient stock on the market, and there are sporadic arrivals at the port. After many days of holding back, the market was immediately suppressed by a small two or three jiao. Although the market was active yesterday, prices have fallen. A total of 6,000 bags of Shashi, Hankou, and other rice were opened in the market, 890 bags of Gan and Wan rice, and 1,200 bags each of Xiang rice and Wuhu and Bengbu rice, totaling 8,291 bags. In addition, 324 bags of Xiangji Yuan went to our local defense, and all of the Hankou brown rice that went to the mainland in small quantities was purchased by Fujian Province. However, the market price has fallen by one, two, or three jiao.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Cake Meal and Wheat Bran are Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>The amount of miscellaneous grains and fertilizers that my country ships to Japan every year is very large. The Japanese post office ship Mayamaru, which exported the day before yesterday, was loaded with approximately 3,000 tons of soybean cake meal and wheat bran. These goods are all transported from the Yangtze River and transferred to Onomichi City, Japan. Furthermore, the Ikoma Maru, which exported today, is loaded with over one hundred tons of broad beans and over seventy tons of rapeseed.</p>
<h3>Ningbo River New Rapeseed Opens at Four Yuan, Soybean Market Only Declines</h3>
<p>The market conditions for new miscellaneous grain products: broad beans seem to have stabilized. Yesterday, 600 to 700 bags of Jiading white broad beans were opened, with a price of three yuan. Over one hundred bags of Ningbo white broad beans were opened, with a price of two yuan, two jiao and six, and two jiao. Wenzhou white broad beans were opened at two yuan and four jiao and a half. Over three hundred bags of Minhang Qing broad beans were opened, with a price of two yuan and nine jiao. Three or four hundred bags of Chongming Shatian Qing broad beans were opened, with a price of two yuan and five jiao. Also, 2,000 bags were delivered in August, with a price of two yuan and three jiao. The trend of rapeseed is weak. Yesterday, 150 bags of new seeds from the Ningbo River arrived for the first time, with a price of four yuan. The goods are still good. Over three hundred bags of Jiujiang goods were opened, with a price of three yuan and four jiao. Recently, the soybean market has been declining since the continuous drop in telegram prices. Although factories are moving, they will not buy unless the price is low. Prices are down another five or six fen compared to last week. On the supply side, trains are arriving one after another. The futures soybean market is currently very bearish, so it may be difficult for the current soybean market to be optimistic for the time being.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Brokers are Still Holding Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was stable because market sentiment had not been activated after the holiday. The association's clearing prices were, for example, 24th grade coarse granulated white sugar at 20 yuan, 06 jiao and 3 fen, transshipment goods at 6 yuan and 7 jiao, several hundred bags were traded. The 8th and 9th grade brown sugar was still at 15 yuan, 7 and 8 jiao, the first grade of white sugar from this factory was 19 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen, and there were also sporadic sales. Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted at 20 yuan and 08 jiao, but there were no transactions. Domestic</p>
<p>Huizhou white sugar opened over one hundred bags, with prices of 17 yuan and 5 jiao, 17 yuan and 2 jiao, and 16 yuan and 5 jiao. Quanzhou Binghua white sugar continued to open over one hundred bags, with prices of 15 yuan and 9 jiao, 15 yuan and 3 jiao, 15 yuan and 1 jiao, and 14 yuan and 8 jiao. Xinghua foreign sugar opened over three hundred bags, with prices of 14 yuan and 2 jiao to 14 yuan and 8 jiao. The Chao gang opened forty or fifty bags of Gao Huanggang, with a price of 13 yuan and 1 jiao. Longjiang Qing brokers cleared over two hundred bags, with a price of 12 yuan and 8 jiao. The asking price is still maintained and not sold. Ma bag cotton red sugar opened over thirty bags, with a price of 14 yuan and 7 jiao. Gao Mianhu red sugar is still asking for 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Longan Sales are Sluggish and Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Because the sales of miscellaneous longan have been quiet for a long time, the market is tired and in a slump. Knowing that the moldy season is approaching, merchants dare not buy in. Therefore, the asking price has not been announced for a long time. Judging from the situation, there will be more disgrace than glory going forward. The following is a record of the recent selling prices of sliced longan by merchants: Top grade 46 yuan, Tianji 35 yuan, Tianhong 23 yuan, sliced 13 yuan, and Zheng 2 sold for 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk is Being Sold Aggressively Overseas</h3>
<p>▲Lyon Factory Undergoes a Sharp Decline: The Lyon raw silk market has recently seen a sharp decline in the price of Chinese silk due to the aggressive selling of new Japanese silk at lower prices. Grade A white filature Double Deer brand, 13-15 denier, is only opening at 61 francs per kilogram, a drop of 5 francs, equivalent to over 610 yuan in Chinese currency per unit, a decrease of approximately 50 yuan. The Double Special brand Xinchang Ben brand, 9-11 denier, is also only opening at 67.25 francs per kilogram.</p>
<p>▲Chinese Silk Shipped to France: The French postal ship Andelai, which exported the day before yesterday, only had 81 bales of yellow and white filature shipped by Xinfu and others to various ports.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Firm Silk Sales are Slow: Yesterday, the sales of foreign firm silk in Shanghai were slow. The European and American markets are filled with Japanese silk, and the aggressive sales continue unabated. No one is inquiring about Chinese silk. The Shanghai silk telegraph is not being transferred. Both Chinese and foreign parties are watching and not moving. The market atmosphere is even more calm. Yesterday, only an Indian firm imported eight bales of yellow and white coarse silk, and the price remains weak.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Green Tea European Sales Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, Shaoxing Pingshui green tea saw slightly active European sales. However, because the market has been sluggish for a long time, the prices of all tea markets have been reduced uniformly. Top-grade head pearl tea has been reduced to 80 yuan, a decrease of 7 or 8 yuan compared to before. As for the Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea, the British firm Jardine Matheson has a very large purchase appetite. Other firms also have sporadic purchases, and the market trend remains firm. Qi Hong, Fuliang, and other varieties of black tea, the Russian firm Xiezhuhui Foreign Firm, has a stronger buying interest. The outbound sales of floral fragrances from British and Russian firms are particularly active. The black tea market is still better than the green tea market.</p>

<h3>The Way of the Teacher</h3>
<p>— Wen Li</p>
<p>I remember that the issue of the way of the teacher was also raised some time ago. It seemed that both teachers and students were brandishing their magic weapons in the air, fighting each other, and the result was either a draw or a death. Unfortunately, there was no follow-up. Now someone is shouting to maintain the dignity of the way of the teacher, and has even issued a declaration to be irreconcilable with the other party. However, the target of the declaration is not the students, but the teachers on the same side. It was already a good show to watch the teachers and students fight each other, but this time it's the teachers fighting each other. If the magic powers are equal, it will be even more exciting. It is said that a country school teacher and a modern school teacher once had a magical battle. One side touted the courses of painting, handicrafts, singing, and gymnastics, while the other side called for teaching the Four Books and Five Classics, Zuo Zhuan, and Donglai Boyi. As a result, the country school teacher set a date to compete in the eight-legged essay, and the modern school teacher "forfeited" and hung up the white flag. Now that modern school teachers are fighting each other, naturally everyone is teaching painting, handicrafts, singing, and gymnastics. Academic competitions are no longer mentioned, and it is feared that magic weapons other than academics will be revealed. These magic weapons other than academics each have their own magical powers. I don't know if the result of the competition will be a draw with no follow-up, or if the latrine will become more and more smelly, causing the "dignified" place of education to become a foul-smelling place. If I am unfortunately right, then the original intention was to maintain dignity, but instead, they will have to take action to overthrow</p>
<p>dignity.</p>
<p>The way of the teacher is inherently dignified. As soon as there is a dispute, dignity is lost. If the dispute continues to the point of magical warfare, the way of the teacher is thrown into the latrine. I don't know what will happen next. I am really worried about the future of education.</p>
<h3>Grandpa</h3>
<p>— Ruo Wang</p>
<p>Every time I come back from outside, I always see Old Man Tang sitting in the living room, looking at me, smiling at me, nodding his head, so quietly.</p>
<p>"Good morning, old sir," he gets up very early in the morning, and when he hears me say that, he still nods his head, smiling so quietly.</p>
<p>Old Man Tang's kindness often makes me want to exchange a few words with him, but every time I talk to him, he just nods his head with a smile, but doesn't say anything. There is a fishbowl in the living room, and the goldfish only blow bubbles and can't talk. This is Old Man Tang's only thing to relieve boredom. In addition, there is also a birdcage, but</p>
<p>the bird in the cage is dead, leaving only the straight rows of</p>
<p>small bamboo fences. There is also a pot of small Nandina planted on the drying platform, and two Impatiens flowers. Every afternoon, he goes to the drying platform to water them, so the Impatiens flowers get bigger and bigger day by day, and time passes day by day.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, Grandpa!" Old Man Tang's grandson comes back from school, but he doesn't answer when he calls him. The radio in his daughter-in-law's room hums a charming little tune, but he doesn't want to listen to it. He just sits quietly in the living room.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, listen! Grandpa, listen!" The grandson drags him to listen to the radio, and his daughter-in-law stands up and points to the radio by his ear and says, "There are people talking in here." The voice of this speech is not speaking, but shouting, but he still doesn't quite understand what he's saying. After a few more calls, he is extremely surprised and says in a loud voice: "Really? Really?" His daughter-in-law nods, and he leans his ear close to the radio. He laughs, silently, laughing with his mouth wide open. From then on, he knows that there is a talking voice in this wooden box.</p>
<p>The grandson and grandpa live on a bed in the pavilion, because grandpa gives him pennies every day. He stays away from his strict father, becomes estranged from his mother, and he only wants grandpa. It seems that only grandpa in this world loves him.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, come here, Grandpa, come here!" The grandson is beaten by his daughter-in-law and asks Grandpa to save him, but Grandpa ignores him. Not that he ignores him, but that Grandpa didn't hear him.</p>
<p>One day, Old Man Tang didn't have any money to buy cigarettes, and naturally he didn't have any change to give to his grandson. The grandson cried and asked for it, and Old Man Tang also lost his temper. A person who usually speaks little becomes unusually talkative at this time, shouting from upstairs to downstairs, and from downstairs to upstairs. The old and the young turn the air of the whole family and the hearts of the people in the neighborhood upside down.</p>
<p>But this trouble is an old problem, and it is not without a way to cure it.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, here's two dollars, here's a pack of cigarettes." Old Man Tang's daughter-in-law always uses this method to cure the old man's trouble. Sure enough, this is a panacea. The old man's mouth is immediately stuffed with light-flavored cigarettes. He takes his grandson's hand and sends him to school.</p>
<p>After a while, Old Man Tang leans his ear back to the radio. The radio is playing a charming little tune. He listens and smiles, silently smiling.</p>
<h3>Knowledge and Morality</h3>
<p>— Nai Shuo</p>
<p>Human morality cannot be said to be an unimportant matter. But in the world, some people value morality very much, but they have not achieved any results. Conversely, some people do not advocate morality very much, but morality is naturally high. For example, our country values morality very much, while the West does not necessarily do so. This can be seen from the speeches of many famous educators and scholars, and let me briefly cite some examples.</p>
<p>In our China, the Three Character Classic, which was read when we were enlightened, is almost entirely moralistic. In other words, Chinese people believe that if they want high morality, they must try their best to instill it from books and education. Therefore, the Three Character Classic says: "If not taught, nature will change," and the Doctrine of the Mean says: "Following nature is called the Way, cultivating the Way is called teaching." In short, the great cause of Confucius and Mencius, which they diligently sought to impart, was "to speak of morality and to talk of benevolence and righteousness." Even the so-called "understanding the mind and seeing the nature" and "hoping to be a sage and hoping to be a worthy person" of the scholars of the Song and Ming dynasties are the ultimate in advocating morality.</p>
<p>This is very different in the West. In education, they focus on the development of knowledge for children and even young adults, and they hardly know what morality is that we humans should cultivate in our daily lives. In their studies, they focus on debating skills, grammar, and slogans. The great philosopher Socrates had such a famous saying: "Knowledge is morality"! That is, as long as people acquire knowledge, they will have high morality. Kant's lifelong question was: "What can we know?" He particularly valued knowledge. Bacon advocated "knowledge is power," and Dewey advocated "creative wisdom." From these many examples, it can be seen that the West does indeed only focus on the development of knowledge, and morality is nothing.</p>
<p>Because of the historical differences between Chinese and Western educational theories, knowledge and morality have become a very confusing and urgently needed problem to be solved.</p>
<p>Recently, many educators and general schools have different ways of dealing with the subject of morality. Those who value morality take "self-cultivation," "civics," "spiritual lectures," and "reading the classics" as required courses for every student. Those who despise morality have no moral subjects at all. There are also those who focus on daily training and do not focus on classroom teaching, believing that moral training should be the responsibility of the disciplinary office, and there is no need to nag in the classroom. These three aspects are all wrong in their own ways. The former makes the mistake of only regarding morality as a kind of knowledge, which inevitably leads to the problem of sitting and talking but not acting. The middle one makes the mistake of paying too much attention to practical life and ignoring the relationship between people, which makes it difficult to make everyone's personality sound. The mistake of the latter is equivalent to the mistake of the social court, which can only use the law to control students but cannot make students moralized.</p>
<p>Now what we want to say is: "What exactly is morality"? Generally speaking, it is the law in the relationship between people, and this law is natural. It is formed by daily habits, and after it is formed, it becomes a law. For example, the morality of love between Chinese people has gradually been transmitted from the West, gradually becoming a habit, and now there are legal provisions. Its content is nothing more than: (1) knowledge, (2) emotion, (3) will, which are integrated into one. Filial piety to one's parents is morality. A child falls into the water, and we go to rescue him. This is also the behavior constituted by these three elements, which is morality.</p>
<p>As for the expression of morality, it is in two aspects: subjective and objective. The subjective is the motive, and the objective is the result. The idealists advocate the subjective (conscience), while the materialists advocate the result. These two schools are a never-ending debate in ethics.</p>
<p>The existence and even the expression of morality changes with society. In other words, it changes with the general relations of production and is different at any time. It has temporality and spatiality. For example, the morality between husband and wife can be used as an explanation. Before humans were civilized, promiscuity between men and women was moral. Later, it progressed to polyandry, then to polygamy, and then to monogamy, all of which conformed to the relations of production at that time. Its spatiality is also the same. The morality of Shanghai is different from that of Beijing, and the morality of the United States is different from that of China.</p>
<p>Morality and knowledge are closely linked, and they are definitely not opposed. It can be said that morality is the promotion of knowledge, and it is a way to seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. When Mencius met King Xuan of Qi, he encouraged him to practice benevolent government. King Xuan of Qi said: "I love wealth and beauty," and Mencius said: "Those are all fine, as long as you promote them, so that "there are no resentful women inside and no unmarried men outside," then loving beauty will also be great."</p>
<p>However, what attitude should we take towards morality? Especially, how should we train students? I have the following opinions:</p>
<p>(1) Schools should pay special attention to the subject of morality.</p>
<p>(2) But special subjects should not be specifically listed.</p>
<p>(3) Nor should we rely solely on the training of rules.</p>
<p>(4) The so-called influence of personality has a very small effect.</p>
<p>(5) Nurturing students' morality should make students' lives socialized. If their lives are socialized, their lives must be extremely fulfilling. That is to say, people with many friends must have a higher degree of morality than ordinary people. As the saying goes, nine out of ten pockmarked people are sinister, and the reason is that when he was young, children were not happy to be with him, making his life lonely. At the same time, he will always regard others as enemies, so he has developed his sinister nature. If you only look for morality in books, it is impossible, and even if you can, it is unreliable. Therefore, the cultivation of students' morality should start with making their lives socialized.</p>
<h3>March</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>1. A Soldier's Diary 1</p>
<p>The number of people wasn't large, two buglers, twenty-odd brothers, snaking through the boundless mountains and fields. Their footsteps were so light that even the sound of their heartbeats could be heard clearly. There were no dark clouds in the sky; a waning crescent moon hung in one corner, and a few sparse stars twinkled. They said nothing, projected by the moonlight, like a large reptile slowly wriggling around the mountainside.</p>
<p>"Shhh!" A drawn-out, faint sound broke through the deathly silence. The leading reptile stopped, and surprise appeared on everyone's faces.</p>
<p>1. Could this plan have been discovered by the enemy? Such a thought floated in everyone's mind, though no one knew exactly why.</p>
<p>"Down! Get down!" As if a common force was controlling their bodies, they instinctively followed the person in front and lay down. Tension occupied their entire being.</p>
<p>Nothing was visible in the distance. The mountain wind howled, and some withered branches rustled. Suddenly, there was a flash of light from the dead trees, not very strong, perhaps because it was still far away? It was like the tail light of a firefly.</p>
<p>Gradually, they heard the sound of the enemy's footsteps. Immediately, the comrades were excited, anticipating the lambs to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>"Guard!" Closer now, he seemed to have noticed the preparation on this side. With that, he shouted the urgent command, rushing madly towards them!</p>
<p>"Platoon leader, the enemy is near Shizui, and it looks like they are about to move!" The scout said breathlessly.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the scout hurried away again, and the large reptile continued to crawl.</p>
<p>1. Hey, Ma Dang, don't say the enemy doesn't have many men, they're still very fierce!</p>
<p>2. What? Fierce? Hmph! They have hands, don't we? Don't we have any?</p>
<p>3. No, their weapons are very powerful!</p>
<p>4. What? Only weapons can be powerful? Those are not to be feared at all; it is the hatred in our hearts that surpasses them many times over!</p>
<p>After passing Tian Yazi, they reached another</p>
<p>mountaintop. Looking around from a high place, the mountain hollow was dark and gloomy, and a layer of faint gauze like clouds and fog covered the back of the mountain. At this time, the moon was about to fall, and the scenery began to reveal some extremely chaotic outlines in the blur.</p>
<p>"Stop!" The platoon leader said after looking through his binoculars. "We've spotted the enemy's cooking smoke in the southwest corner. We need to crawl over there more carefully, and</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>each person should be a little further apart."</p>
<p>They stopped on a small hillside less than half a mile from Shizui. They quickly attached bayonets to their rifles and tightened their belts. Cells were jumping, blood was flowing faster, and they felt neither tired nor hungry. Their eyes were burning.</p>
<p>1. Brothers, let's go. The meaning of survival is on our shoulders. Brothers, look! Aren't they preparing to leave? What a great opportunity! Go, hurry, let's go!</p>
<p>When they were as close as possible, they unanimously raised their shining blades and charged into the enemy ranks that were just starting to move. The formation rolled into the enemy's core like a tidal wave, and the enemy, caught off guard, retreated.</p>
<p>Bright flags were flying in the wind, just before dawn.</p>
<h3>Street Performers</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>Every dusk, in the fading twilight, one can always see a pair of street performers between these long streets. One plays the huqin, and the other sings. They walk along the houses on the long street, and when they pass in front of each house, they smile and ask if anyone wants to hear a song. However, they rarely get any business, and are often chased away mercilessly because they are wearing ragged, dirty clothes of vagrants. They make people feel disgusted at first sight. The age difference between the man and the woman is about the same as that between a father and daughter. No one knows if they are really father and daughter, and no one has ever bothered to notice. They have spent countless days in these places. Whether it is rainy or sunny, when the myriad lights of dusk are shining, one can hear the desolate and melancholy strings and the clear and resentful singing, now soft, now loud, drifting in the faint and silent air. Drifting among these long streets, gently disturbing a corner of the lonely air.</p>
<p>At the window of a foreign barracks, a few soldiers were squatting. No one asked them to sing, but the two of them stopped on the sidewalk. The man endlessly played the huqin for a long time, and then the woman opened her throat and began to sing. Her voice was clear and beautiful, but every note carried a heavy sense of melancholy, like the melancholy expression painted on their faces. Several soldiers wore playful expressions, grinning greedily, staring intently at the woman, muttering something. The woman had a malnourished, sallow, thin face, and messy hair falling over her forehead. But her features were quite pretty. If she were made up and dressed in fashionable and gorgeous clothes, she would probably be no different from the wealthy young ladies in cars. But she was a wandering girl, a street performer! She became a little embarrassed by the soldiers' staring, so she turned around, facing the wall, but on the other side, three or five ruffian-like men surrounded her, staring at her with equally obscene eyes. She lowered her head, her eyes fixed on the ground, never daring to look up again. The people around her kept laughing, talking, and even teasing her. It was obvious that these people had no sympathy for the two of them, but harbored a despicable heart.</p>
<p>When the song was finished, the huqin stopped. Some had already walked away. The man reached out his hand, half begging, "Sir, give us a few pennies!"</p>
<p>Everyone made faces and dispersed. Watching the people leave, the two sighed deeply at the same time. The black wings of night had covered their heads, and the streets were filled with bright lights. However, their hearts were empty and hungry. They looked at each other in silence and walked away silently.</p>
<p>Fate had given them a black piece of land, without light, without emotion. Every day they ran their legs off and hoarsened their throats, only to get a mouthful of cold rice, and more insults and ridicule. The girl's youth was thus spent in the vulgar jokes of the street, poor people!</p>
<h3>Mastermind</h3>
<p>— Bu Yang</p>
<p>Don't underestimate someone just because they're short; their belly is full of tricks!</p>
<p>A high forehead indicates intelligence; a pointed chin indicates competence; a big belly indicates skill at mental calculations. Indeed, he possessed the wisdom of three cobblers. Whenever people gave him a thumbs up and called him a mastermind, he always accepted it proudly.</p>
<p>The archetype of a mastermind should be like this.</p>
<p>His surname was Zhu, and his former name was given to him by an old scholar who shook his head and swayed his body: "Depei". However, he felt that "Pei" was a homophone of "Bai," which negatively affected his intelligence. So he opened his wise eyes and searched through the unofficial novels he had read, and suddenly found the phrase "winning every battle" in the table of contents. The membrane in his high forehead quickly vibrated:</p>
<p>!! Winning!</p>
<p>His pointed chin twitched, and he felt that this name suited his identity very well.</p>
<p>Of course, a mastermind should win every battle. Sometimes he would even doubt his surname: "Zhu" "Pig" was terribly unpleasant, but that useless old man just happened to share the same surname "sound" as the livestock in the slaughterhouse. If surnames could really be changed, then he would definitely change his surname to Zhao! The Zhao in the Hundred Family Surnames. But he couldn't, he couldn't bear to part with the property earned by that old man like an ox.</p>
<p>"Mastermind" "Zhu Desheng", a homophonic pun, he admired the mystery of his name.</p>
<p>The mastermind hated being called "shorty" the most. In fact, he was much shorter than others. Sitting on a stool, he looked like a monkey, his feet always dangling in the air. He often thought about transforming his body, making it as tall as others, but the body was not a name, which he could change freely!</p>
<p>So the intelligent him prepared a thousand-patterned answer. As long as someone offended him, he would quickly retaliate.</p>
<p>1. Shorty! 2. Short your son! He laughed victoriously, and others laughed too. 3. Shorty!</p>
<p>Short your son. He laughed victoriously again.</p>
<h3>Before the Sun Rises</h3>
<p>— Shu Bai</p>
<p>The sky is hazy, it shouldn't be long before the light of dawn rises!</p>
<p>The earth is quiet and silent, as if the world has died. The night wind blowing from the treetops still makes people feel a chill, even though it is already early summer. The moon has lost its inherent light, and the stars have also stopped twinkling their charming eyes, because their fate has been eliminated, and another sun with more vitality will break through the darkness, replacing the moon and stars to illuminate another world with a fragrance like roses.</p>
<p>But time is moving like a clumsy ox, without bringing any sign of dawn. Every now and then one or two stars suddenly shine brightly, as if it were still midnight. Heavy clouds also densely cover the bit of dawn rising from the east. Is it evening? People are doubtful.</p>
<p>But everything in the universe has awakened from the sleep of the night. If we listen carefully, the sea is surging, it will break through the banks and submerge this sleeping world. The sparrows also open their eyes in their nests and chirp softly, waiting for the arrival of light to make a distant journey. The roses also straightened their delicate bodies and slowly unfolded their petals, waiting to release their fragrance in the morning; everything is ready, waiting only for the arrival of light. The air feels a little chilly because darkness is struggling tensely with light.</p>
<p>Dawn has not yet arrived, and many of the leaves of the pomegranate trees have been blown off by the cold wind of the night. So why doesn't the gentle dawn shine on this dark world? However, dawn will undoubtedly come. Although dark clouds often cover the dawn on the eastern horizon, and the stars often twinkle their brilliance, all of this will be eliminated. The dark clouds will eventually be broken through by the bright sun, and the stars will eventually lose their lives under the light, because their end has come, and their strength cannot reverse it.</p>
<p>So, let us wait, wait for the arrival of the bright, fragrant, and gentle light of dawn!</p>

<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Chastity Memorial Arch (5)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>At this time, Shimin stood there blankly, neither crying nor laughing, but always feeling awkward. He thought they were a familiar group, while he was just a lonely one. Not far from him, he heard a child riding on the back of an ox whisper to another child:</p>
<p>"Last time, my ox was walking on the road, and secretly took a bite of the rice in Grandpa Zhengfu's house. The hired hand in his house saw it, and slapped me in the face, and also said he was going to take my ox away." "Isn't that so?" Another child responded, "The people in his house are really hateful." Shimin felt quite uncomfortable hearing this. Those were all people he didn't know, but they were talking about things about his house. Suddenly, he heard a child climbing on the memorial arch say:</p>
<p>"Hey, Shimin, do you want it? I'll knock a Bodhisattva down for you." Shimin was very happy and nodded quickly. So the child climbed down again and took a stone up. Many stone figures were carved on the memorial arch. Some were riding horses, and in front of them were people holding flags, all wearing armor, like clowns on stage. There were also gardens, bridges, houses, and birds, but unfortunately they were all too high to reach. At the top was a square plaque with the words "Imperial Edict" written on it, which he recognized. Below it were the four words "Eternal Glory", and below that was a long plaque that read "Chastity Memorial Arch for Lady Liu, Mother of Shi". Those words were probably gilded in the past, but they had faded now.</p>
<p>The child was knocking on the head of a figure on it, looking very strenuous, because his hand was not long enough. It was almost three inches away, and he couldn't knock the small statue down easily. Shimin felt very worried for him, fearing that he would fall. Suddenly, he heard a rough voice yelling behind him. He turned around and saw Gray Chicken Granny standing in the middle of the round doorway, wearing a very terrifying face, scolding the child for not breaking the stone memorial arch. So the child climbed down in fear, not daring to look at Gray Chicken Granny at all. But she was still scolding:</p>
<p>"You little bastard, aren't you afraid of death? Yesterday, Shimin's father said, 'The memorial arch in the village has been</p>
<p>knocked to pieces by people. It's really a pity...'. It turns out it was you little bastards who ruined it. Just wait until Shimin's father finds out, he'll give you a good beating on your backside."</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>Hollywood: Salaries of Several Famous Actresses</h3>
<p>— Jin Heqin</p>
<p>We often hear people say that Hollywood stars earn huge salaries. But we don't know how much they actually earn. The stars are very secretive about this issue, for fear that if people find out, it will attract the attention of bandits. In order to prevent outsiders from knowing their actual figures, many people in Hollywood like to guess their salaries randomly, saying that the big stars there earn at least tens of thousands of US dollars a month, or even hundreds of thousands a month. As a result, the news spread, and the whole world thought their salaries were incredible! In fact, their salaries are not as high as rumored.</p>
<p>Originally, we wouldn't have known, but not long ago, Jean Harlow asked MGM for a raise, but was not granted it. She was so angry that she revealed the actual salaries of several famous actresses. It turned out that she had won the third place in the Hollywood actress competition this year, but her salary was less than half that of the tenth place, no wonder this fiery star was so angry. Now I will translate the actual salaries of the top ten actresses that she mentioned below:</p>
<p>(1) Marie Dressler: US$3,500 per week (2) Janet Gaynor: US$4,500 per week (3) Jean Harlow: US$1,500 per week (4) Joan Crawford: US$4,500 per week (5) Greta Garbo: US$9,000 per week (6) Mae West: US$70,000 per film (7) Constance Bennett: US$7,000 per week (8) Ruth Chatterton: US$7,500 per week (9) Ann Harding: US$6,000 per week (10) Marlene Dietrich: US$5,000 per week</p>
<p>(Note: The above rankings are based on the positions in the competition, not on the level of salary) From the above salary chart, the mysterious girl Greta Garbo earns the most after all. Although the old queen Marie Dressler is named first, her salary can be said to be the lowest among the ten actresses except Jean Harlow. It can be seen that although the queen's brand is old, it is not as attractive as the mysterious girl. This fiery star Jean Harlow, at a very young age, was able to rank third among thousands of actresses, indeed her magic is also considerable. However, the film company boss did not buy her account because of her young age and tender qualifications, and refused to increase her salary to the same level as the veteran stars, no wonder she was disappointed. In fact, her salary cannot be said to be small, compared to the dozens of yuan a month earned by our country's actresses, there is a real difference between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Written After Watching "Song of the Fishermen"</h3>
<p>— Nai Huang</p>
<p>"Song of the Fishermen" is able to make the beginning and end of the plot full of spirit because of the screenwriter's elaborate structure. In terms of the value of the screenplay, it is worthy of our attention. The theme of "Song of the Fishermen" is to win the sympathy of the audience by depicting the hellish life of fishermen. It writes about the hardship of the fishermen's lives, the suffering of injustice, imprisonment, and finally being burned to death. At the same time, the misfortune of wealthy families, the embezzlement of managers, the escape of wives, the pressure of shareholders, and even suicide are all written out one by one.</p>
<p>But in fact, there are also inappropriate places. Let me just give two points to talk about.</p>
<p>First, when ten bandits come, they will never rob the poor first without robbing the rich.</p>
<p>Second, indeed, this is the biggest mistake. How can there be such a fortress-like house in the fishermen's area, because in fact there would not be one.</p>
<p>One or two points are the shortcomings of "Song of the Fishermen," maybe it was just a moment of carelessness! But because it has a deep description of the life of fishermen and the life of the rich, it can finally achieve very good results.</p>
<p>As for the actors, they all worked hard. Wang Renmei is very good, and her movements are also very natural, but Han Langen is a bit affected. Most of the others are okay.</p>
<p>The photography is very flexible, so it can make "Song of the Fishermen" a beautiful picture.</p>
<p>In short, "Song of the Fishermen" is indeed on par with "Sister Flowers". It is Cai Chusheng's successful work. It is also the best product of Lianhua this year.</p>
<h3>My Thoughts on "Song of the Fishermen"</h3>
<p>— Du Cunjie</p>
<p>Indeed! "Song of the Fishermen" is another powerful work by Lianhua.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also an outstanding work in the Chinese silver screen after "Life", which is an undeniable fact!</p>
<p>When the screen unfolds, we see the sun in the East China Sea gradually rising from the verdant Eastern Mountains, and the morning glow reflects the turbulent waves, and the fishermen sing melodious songs on the sea: Song of the Fishermen, what a picture full of poetic charm!</p>
<p>But who knows the pain and tragedy behind them?</p>
<p>The performances are mostly satisfactory, especially the scene of the fire.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, this film naturally has its flaws to some extent: for example, the subtitles are still not concise enough, and the director's contrastive techniques seem to be too many.</p>
<p>In short, "Song of the Fishermen" is undoubtedly a work that rivals "Life".</p>
<h3>After Watching "Mr. Wang"</h3>
<p>— Guan Yun</p>
<p>The "Mr. Wang" comic strip by Ye Qianyu was brought to the screen by Tianyi Company. Because I have always liked to watch Mr. Ye's comics, I went to Beijing to see it once. After the film ended and the people dispersed, I felt that there were some unsatisfactory aspects of the film, and now I will just give a few points to talk about:</p>
<p>1. Before going out to watch a movie, Xiao Chen's wife wanted Xiao Chen to accompany her. Except for Xiao Chen pretending to have a stomachache, Shu Lijuan, who played Mrs. Chen, had no expression at all, and the shot was too long.</p>
<p>2. Mr. Wang running out of the theater, knocking people down and then running away is also a superfluous shot.</p>
<p>3. The repeated quarrels and fights between the two fat people in the shoe store do not show any humor, but are just messing around.</p>
<p>4. Mr. Wang's tailing and the results of the tailing are simply inexplicable without looking at the instructions.</p>
<p>5. When Xiao Chen and Wang Liuru arrived at the dance hall, there should have been a dancing scene, and then a joke was made, but what was shown was a dance by several Western women.</p>
<p>6. The so-called "a storm caused everyone in the entire dance hall to burst into laughter" at the end was not performed.</p>
<p>As for the actors, they are generally okay, and the photography and scenery are also very good. It is said that Tianyi Company is also going to shoot a sequel "?", we hope that he can enrich the content a bit and work hard to make it shine in domestic comedies.</p>
<h3>The Four-Cornered War Begins in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Xi Fu</p>
<p>Children, children, the war has begun. Will it be decided in one round? Or will it be ten or eight rounds with no end in sight? These four big stars have appeared in Hollywood, and it can be said that the film industry will have no quiet days. These four big stars are Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Anna Sten, and Lupe Velez.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo's backer is Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Paramount is currently cheering for Marlene Dietrich. Schenck and United Artists are doing their best to encourage Lupe Velez. Suddenly, Samuel Goldwyn brings out the golden signboard of Anna Sten. Hollywood is like a big arena, seeing whose magic power is the greatest among the four of them. However, we can predict their prospects in advance:</p>
<p>Miss Garbo has unlimited prestige. Her personality is incredible, and her good scenes rely entirely on her solo performance! Just that face full of tragic meaning is enough. And Miss Dietrich? She is the most sensual actress, and she has a seductive personality. When she acts, she is very touching with just a little effort. It is truly easy and twice the result with half the effort. Lupe Velez is an excellent actress. Her talents are all-encompassing! Smart, delicate, relaxed, unique, sad. Her achievements in "Catherine the Great" are achievements that others cannot hope for. But she does not have amazing beauty, nor does she have the magic of youth. As for Anna Sten, what she excels at and what the other three cannot match is her moving beauty. Her performance is also quite good. Her figure is slender, truly a supreme clothes rack, but her beauty, in particular, is radiant and unapproachable.</p>
<p>None of the four of them are native to America. One is Swedish, one is German, one is British, and one is Russian, but their producers all treat them as rare commodities and compete with each other. They disregard everything and spare no expense, each trying to promote the star they are touting. This competition has already begun, when will a winner be decided?</p>
<p>The Lianhua First Film Studio, Fei Mu's "Fragrant Snow Sea," following his direction of "Life," has established a new style in terms of subject matter. However, it does not criticize and give proper enlightenment to the unfreedom of marriage in the remaining feudal old rural areas, and it also has a new understanding of patriarchal society. It goes without saying that when this film is released in the future, the Chinese silver screen will once again reap a great honor.</p>
<p>The other day, they filmed the scene of A Su (Ruan Lingyu) entering a nunnery to become a nun. The scene was very desolate. A Su made a grand vow for the sake of her son. She believed that her son's survival was the power of God, so she went to become a nun. Her husband, A Gen (Gao Zhanfei), and her young son (Li Keng) were unwilling to let her go, but she was very determined. When A Gen led his young son to the nunnery to beg her to return, they all cried bitterly. At this time, the entire atmosphere was very tense and bleak, and the heartstrings of all the staff were trembling from their crying. After this shot was finished, everyone shuddered. They saw Ruan Lingyu wiping her tears and sitting on a chair, Li Keng sobbing and leaning on her. Lao Gao silently hugged his fists and sat on a rockery, looking at the ground. Many visiting gentlemen and ladies on the side were all very quiet at this time, focusing their attention on the three of them.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Scene from "Fragrant Snow Sea"</h3>
<p>Movie novel</p>
<h3>Sea Dry, Stone Railing (Registered Nurse) (10)</h3>
<p>— Jie Hua</p>
<p>Frank himself is a cold-hearted person. After he finished speaking, knowing that his mission had been completed, he walked away as if nothing had happened, and had no pity for the patient in his heart. But James Burden was heartbroken. He used his fragile brain to think: thinking: A assistant came in, holding a hypodermic needle in his hand. He discovered James's spirit, suddenly showing a weak attitude, and scolded in a low voice: "That annoying guy is here again. Do you find it annoying?" James hurriedly shook his head and said, "No, I am very grateful to him..."</p>
<p>James' operation was scheduled for eight o'clock. At seven thirty-five, Burden was already anxiously unrecognisable. She walked back and forth alone in the lounge. She reluctantly lit a cigarette, blew a puff of smoke, and then snuffed it out. She felt utterly bored. Apart from the fact that time was passing minute by minute, she knew nothing else. Suddenly the door opened and Connery ran in. He said to Burden, "Burden, why don't you talk to me! You always seem to be avoiding me..." Burden's attitude was stubborn, biting her lip and saying, "We have nothing to talk about." Connery, hearing this, was afraid that her heart had changed, and hurriedly said, "Isn't it good now? Why not always be like this?" Burden asked strangely, "What do you mean by this, don't you want me to operate on James?" After she finished speaking, she stared at him blankly. He nodded and said, "Why not? You were willing to forget him before. What is the difference between now and before, except that he is here and he is ten miles away." As he spoke, he stretched out his arms as if it were natural and hugged her tightly, saying, "Burden, I love you. No matter what the outcome, you and I will always be..." Unexpectedly, Burden pushed him away angrily. Connery had no choice but to let his hands droop after being pushed by her. He thought that Burden must be upset, or just a temporary fit of anger. That way, it would be best to let her go for the time being. A woman's temper is unpredictable. But after a while, she will definitely submit. He did not know that Burden had already seen his heart. Her good eyes glared at him, as if she regarded him as a devil. She watched him walk away. She had seen through his character. It was not true love, but a demon who deceived women, deceiving her as he had deceived many other women. She couldn't help but shiver at the thought. But in an instant her gaze turned to the mirror, it was already seven forty, her own fate, as well as James' life and death, were already hanging within these twenty minutes!</p>
<p>But James did not wait until eight o'clock. Fifteen minutes beforehand, he had already decided his own fate, using his own sacrifice to repay his beloved wife's kindness. All the pain, sorrow, and worry that he had given to Burden, he wanted to eliminate it all at once! He could not continue to survive and risk that danger, again making his beloved wife suffer endlessly for him. He was unwilling to live the rest of his life in darkness. So he borrowed that window, that tall window overlooking the whole city, perceiving everything, but also indifferently ignorant, as the final way out to get rid of all troubles. (To be continued)</p>
