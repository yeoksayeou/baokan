<h3>巴爾幹公約之展望愼</h3>
<p>歐洲大陸危機四伏到處有爆發之可能。説者謂今日國際關係。較之第一次大戰之前夕。尤爲緊張殆非過言雖各國外交家尙在竭力飾掩。充其量不過緩和形勢於一時殊不能消滅禍根於無形蓋歐陸列强。互相猜忌。由來已久不過目下皆不甘自居戎首。輕於發難武裝和平之局面乃得成立耳。</p>
<p>懷恨已深之德意志。爲國力所限。不易以武力清算舊賬。法蘭西坐凡爾塞和約之賜躊躇滿志。處處持重不敢輕率。在墨索里尼統治下之意大利。雖深不滿於法。而對德關係亦因其親奥政策而未見十分良好。正在觀望形勢。以求其所大欲。蘇聨因遠東局面。日趨嚴重。不願向西歐各國挑戰以致腹背受敵。而素稱歐洲火藥庫之巴爾幹半島諸國。亦竟以草訂和平公約聞於世。該約之草案。已由希臘南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞土爾其四國簽定。惟保加得亞尙無加入之表示。然其執政當局。果能高瞻遠矚。審度利害。便知此公約之成立雖無補於巴爾幹之永久和平差足消弭歐洲之危險於萬一也</p>
<p>此次保加利亞所以不願參加公約其理由有三點。第一注重少數民族問題之解决。畮二提倡軍備之平等。第三獲得保加利亞愛琴海之交通甬道。該約全文。現雖尙未宣佈．但希臘等四國反對保國之提議頗爲堅决。吾人深覺少數民族問題．實爲巴爾幹之禍。因誠能求得一比較公允之解决辦法則和平前途。或有一線之曙光．軍備平等原難銖兩悉稱毫無偏頗。如愈求其平衡。則問題愈多。現代各國之整軍備武。莫不藉口於自衛。實則彼此能開誠布公。旣無侵略可更何所謂自衛．故由軍備平等而謀和平。和平終不可得。眞欲消弭戰禍。當自毁滅殺人之武器着手。保國欲此次公約提倡軍備平等恐不免重蹈日内瓦軍縮會議之覆轍耳。由保加利亞而出愛琴海。非假道於希臘不可。惟希國必不肯令保加利亞深入堂奥。自干未便。歐戰結果。保國失地甚多。維持巴爾幹現狀之議。深爲保國所反對。固在间避如并出海問題而不能滿意解决。自更不願贸然就範爲人作嫁也。</p>
<p>至巴爾幹公約。對於締約國境外之影曫則可以一言以蔽之曰。意大利帝國主義將深受打擊。而使法意間之暗門。變本加厲。蓋意大利素以侵略南斯拉夫爲其立國方針之一。而法國則頗以此爲忌。巴爾幹公約苟告成立。南斯</p>
<p>拉夫可以從容對意。而無後顧之憂。法人鑒於墨索里尼東進政策之受挫。必將自詡其外交之勝利。其結果能否使德意邦交改善。或甚至促成世界兩大汎繫主義國之携手合作。雖尙在未定之天。而其意義之深遠。則固有識者所公認也。</p>
<h3>政變革命謠言蠭起</h3>

<p>警察總監撤職掀起風波</p>
<p>衆院開會結果尙未分曉</p>
<p>新政府左支右絀難持久</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日逹拉第政府將在國會中爲生存而奮鬥。已有警察憲兵及軍士三萬人凖備鎭壓任何騷亂。全城謠言極盛、竟有謂將發生「政變」及</p>
<p>「革命」者、據法國行動報載稱、國會已安置機關槍、國會附近半哩内之交通現已暫行停止、故機關槍或不致用及、巴黎駐軍刻均在兵房中凖備以便隨時出動、刻有騎兵一隊、由森里士調來、並由康比尼運來坦克車多輛、現信警察力能維持秩序時、绝不輕用兵力、内政部長警告新警察總監西波、如一有游行示威發生、則必將其解職、同時將此意轉告各級警官、故各警官爲維持其職位起見、必能努力維持治安、但在另一方面、全國退伍軍人聨合會宣佈、將派三萬人游行示威、而青年愛國團．共產黨．法斯西黨及保皇黨等亦均在集合中、德國報紙對於最近巴黎事件頗多評論、認爲逹拉第政府仍能控制大局、保皇黨政變之説實不可能、德國各界人士對於法總理依賴問題、發生影響、頗多猜測、前警察總監夏浦解職事、巴黎警界人員頗爲不安、當夏氏交卸出辦公室時、羣衆歡呼以送之、巴黎現確在危險狀態中、刻各方對於夏浦之解職、頗多爭論、現時有二問題、卽夏氏果與巴央納巿公債騙案有關、則何以擢升駐摩洛哥總督之職、設無關係、則何以被解職是也（六日路透社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）今日衆院開會、會塲無虚席、旁聽席亦患人滿、總理逹拉弟宣讀其大政方針宣言甫十分鐘、會塲中已喧囂大作、致總理之言不能爲人所聞、故不得不中止、而暫時停會、此種景象、實爲法國國會歷史中所僅見、停會一舉有恢復秩序之效果、逹拉第旋復入塲、而畢其宣言、總理繼乃提出一種辦法、今日僅限反對黨四人發言質問、逹氏决以此爲信任問題於是議員乃從事投票表决、</p>
<p>（巴黎）衆料逹拉第政府賴社會黨之擁護、經衆院長時間激烈之辯論後、可望生存、但逹氏雖運用其智略、並發表一文、籲請巴黎民衆安靜自處、但恐縱在國會勝利、其政府之壽命亦不致久長也、現除街巿暴動堪虞外、而穩健方面亦反對政府、此就巴黎巿議會取銷星期四日之宴會可以徵之、該宴會爲一年之盛會、總統與新閣員均被柬邀、今忽臨時作罷、聞因市議員拒絶與新閣員同案共餐之故、外間甚至有市議會擬拒絶通過警政費藉以抵制新任警總監西波氏之傳説、今日當局禁止民用飛機飛於巴黎天空、惟商業飛機除外、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>國聨準備</h3>
<p>處理德奥問題</p>
<p>十五日可召集特别會議</p>
<p>十九日即召集軍縮大會</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據重要人員聲稱、在國聨討論奥國問題之特别會議以後、軍縮會議或可立卽在日内瓦開會之希望、據稱、奥總理杜爾夫斯若於本星期内向國聨提出關於德國干涉奥國内政之抗議書、則國聨可於二月十五日開會、同時軍縮籌備委員在倫敦先事凖備、十九日在日内瓦正式開大會、法國現正向各方宣傳、希望早日開會、惟其態度則仍反對德英意三國之提議、據法國各代表之意見、擬仍按照從前議决案、各國不准加增軍備云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）此間均以爲國聨會奥國代表佛盧格爾、將於星期一請求國聨會召集行政院非常會議、討論德奥問題、不料本日傍晚時忽得消息、謂奥國政府、雖仍主張求直於國聨會、但擬俟總理陶爾斐斯赴匈牙利京城之後、始向日内瓦提出此案、爲期當在星期五以後奥國政府所以愼重自持者、解釋不一、有謂由於内政上之事變者、有謂由於英倫方面之勸告者、但國務會議固一致主張求直於國聨會、不久卽將以關於德奥關係之案卷一厚册送致列强、俾明眞相云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>維也納奥國之向國聨陳請保護、以防德國之干涉内政一節、係由今日内閣會議討論五小時後之决定、杜爾夫斯總理曾由内閣授以全權籌備一切、向日内瓦提出陳請之步驟、惟内閣中對於此事意見並非一致、因有數人頗覺此舉之不妥一則恐增加國内之恐慌、一則使德奥間感情益致惡化也、且一般人士俱悉此舉在英國方面極不贊同、惟法國則固傳統政策、頗覺愜意云、杜爾夫斯自内閣授與特權之後、立卽致一電於奥國駐日内瓦永久代表弗魯格爾氏、囑其往訪秘書長愛文諾氏、請求理事會召集非常會議、以考慮奥國之請求、同時復再致電於波蘭外長貝克氏、作同樣之請求、以貝氏爲本年理事會之主席也、并聞理事會約於本星期内卽可召集會議云（五日國民電）</p>

<h3>蘇俄頒新命令</h3>
<p>備戰重要步驟</p>
<p>增高遠東赤軍餉糈</p>
<p>嘉惠農民蠲賦六年</p>
<p>（莫斯科）據今日當局公布共產黨秘書長史丹林與人民委員會及勞工防務會主席莫洛託夫簽字之命令、此實爲近年來最重要命令之一、該命令規定西比利亞東部與外貝加爾之赤軍月餉、均將增高、辦公處人員月俸增百分之十至三十不等、集合農田與其耕種者今後六年内蠲免其應納諸國家之收成、個人農民則蠲免三年、據當局聲稱、此項計畫志在改善勞工狀况、及改善此數地與面里亞蒙古自治社會主義蘇維埃共和國境内居住者之經濟狀况、但有數方面視此爲備戰之重要步骤、蓋毘連滿洲之境内狀况旣佳、則人必樂居其徙居者旣衆、則天然利源必可大爲發展而可大有利於國家也、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聨人民委員會及全聨邦共產黨中央委員會關於特惠東部西伯利亞居民之命令、已經公佈、該會由莫洛托夫及史丹林簽署、其文云、鑒於移居布里亞蒙古自治蘇維埃共和國及外貝加爾東西伯利亞區者日益衆多、同時鑒於吾人必須便利彼等經濟的定住、並改進若輩遠離蘇聨文化中心之手工工人及機關職員之勞動條件、故蘇聨人民委員會及全聨邦共黨中央委員會命令該地集體農塲及集體農民得免向國家繳納榖物六年、私人農民則免繳三年、同時規定若干區域得免納其他農產、而其餘各區得减低繳納額數、本項命令復使該區域内手工工人及機關職員之薪工增加百分之十至三十、並提高東部西伯利亞區内外貝爾加區域軍隊之給養云、（六日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>俄邊軍事準備</h3>
<p>日本感受威脅</p>
<p>菱刈主派私人赴俄緩和空氣</p>
<p>莫斯科要人之演説</p>
<p>東京譬諸弱犬易吠</p>
<p>（大連）菱刈聲稱、蘇俄顯不能了解日本、渠希望蘇俄在「滿洲國」邊界一帶作軍事凖備、不致發生意外事端、今宜遣派私人非正式赴莫斯科和緩兩國間之緊張、蘇俄似已在「滿洲國」邊界大部分有軍事之設置、海參崴·斯巴斯加雅·海蘭泡·伯力·大烏里均設有軍事根據地、此種軍事設置之建造、爲自衛計乎、抑爲進攻計乎、其蘇俄確有所圖乎、無從知之、但吾人此時必須極爲謹愼、勿輕啓釁端、蘇俄對日本多所誤會、殊堪扼腕、蘇俄在西比利亞邊界一帶設有偉大之防禦工程、卽此一端、已足證蘇俄不能了解日本之政策云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）蘇俄獨裁者史丹林·總理大臣莫洛託夫·外相李維諾夫·及陸相布洛希羅夫等要人最近頻爲攻擊日本之演説、綜合日本外務陸軍兩當局之對此意見大使如下、</p>
<p>（一）蘇俄以其對外强硬演説、煽惑無智國民之心目、極力宣傳共產政府爲强力之政府、（二）現在歐洲有比一九一三年世界大戰以前更有力之戰因、而在一觸卽發之危機、然因無經濟的實力、暗中希望遠東方面發生戰爭、蘇俄卽被歐洲諸國煽動、而爲對日强硬之言動、（三）美國去年承認蘇俄後、蘇俄如此態度、更爲露骨、（四）弱狗易吠、蘇俄第二次五年計劃、實無多大結果、其對外放駡之時、國内必有不得已事件、此卽彼輩外交之常套手段也、（六日日聨電）</p>
<h3>中東路問題</h3>
<p>日俄關係緊張</p>
<p>俄責日軍不償債務</p>
<p>並非法捕禁俄工人</p>
<p>黑河僞警開槍傷人</p>
<p>僞向蘇俄領署道歉</p>
<p>（莫斯科）日俄間風雲近來頗爲緊張、今日俄外交部發出兩報告、一則責備日本不允償還以前用中東鐵路在滿洲運兵所欠經費二千萬羅布、一則指日本干涉中東鐵路、並監禁大批俄籍工人、均係不合法紀、去年日本曾付俄國四十三萬五千羅布作爲清償國際間負債之用、日本管理中東路尙稱順手、然最近有德國等歐洲諸國由西比利亞鐵路運來貨物均遭延擱、其原因實因受日本限制載貨車輛所致云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>伯力綏芬河車站之日滿税關及警察當局正一味破壞中東路與烏蘇里路間之貨運、彼等擅自限定每日出口貨運、限於五十輛、目的在故意將運輸减至此種數量、同時規定每次載貨車輛不得超過三輛、彼等對此種辦法之解釋、均諉謂職員人手不够、警士鑒於外國出口商運赴海參崴之貨物絡繹不絶、遂禁止車輛接上烏蘇里鐵道、並逮捕車上職員及採取其他壓制辦法、最近有路員二十四人來自烏蘇里鐵路、當遭逮捕、並經搜查三小時後卽予開釋、日滿當局之此等非法步驟、無非欲公開摧殘中東路之輸出貨運云、（六日塔斯電）</p>
<p>伯力據海蘭泡黑龍江對岸中國城巿黑河來訊、當地有警官一人忽放射其連響手槍、傷其他警士三人、遂捕逃、另有警察一隊向之開排槍、黑河蘇聨領事館之汽車適於是時經過、領事館職員烏索夫坐車内、肩部受傷、當地滿洲當局卽表示遺憾、並向蘇聨領事館道歉云、（六日塔斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）本日之議會其注目點、均集中於貴院、該院本會議於本日午前十時十分開會、永井拓相與關直彥氏關於南洋興發公司之問題行使問答後、則由大河内輝耕子爵登壇質問－－</p>
<p>關於外交問題、仍欲請外相加以説明、現今對於世界戰爭行將發生之説、談論此項趨勢者頗不乏人、其餘如日蘇關係與中日關係等等、仍請將外交方針加以詳細解釋爲要、</p>
<p>廣田外相答－－</p>
<p>以現在之情勢觀之、可謂完全無此項戰爭危險、余則確信無疑矣、至於日蘇關係更覺毫無悲觀、余以爲必有相當方針以應付之、又如中日關係、所謂排日抗日等等行動、原屬一時之現象、中日兩國無論如何非親睦不可、余卽以</p>
<p>此項信條、爲應付今日之時局也、</p>
<p>大河内子爵問－－</p>
<p>外相雖謂不至發生戰爭、而陸海軍當局則謂對於國民可以决定之方式説明之、是何用意、</p>
<p>大角海相與林陸相同作簡單之答辯－－</p>
<p>此事當與外交工作相輔而行、又以充實國防爲必要、</p>
<p>次由赤池濃君質問－－</p>
<p>包圍日本之三大國、觀其現狀、則吾人非大加考慮不爲功、蓋愁雲密佈、人同此感、吾人對於此種國際情形、斷不能盲然處之、首先對於蘇俄之行動應愼重觀察、最近據滿洲傳來之情報、則謂朝鮮人之在滿工作者、近已在批返鮮、據謂日蘇開戰迫於眉睫、其理由則謂蘇俄在滿洲國境、駐有十五萬以至十九萬之兵力、並築有永久之要塞、此外則根據史丹林之談話、綜合上述各種情形、可見滿洲國民斷難安居樂業、故覺「滿洲國」現在非圖國外之安全不可、外相究施以若何對蘇外交工作、爲謀「滿洲國之安全起見」對於蘇俄應施以若何之外交工作、以上當請廣田外相詳答、</p>
<p>時至正午議會宣告休息、</p>
<p>（東京）貴族院本會議午後繼續開會、關於赤池氏之質問、由廣田外相答－－</p>
<p>余覺赤池氏所談各節極應注意、我與蘇俄關係至感重要、故時與蘇聨關係諸人續行交涉、日夜努力、以免遺誤、關於「滿洲國」與日本之立塲、當求世界予以諒解、今後余仍當繼續努力也、</p>

<p>福建不得割讓與任何國、其明文載在條約、現已被人侵害矣、茲條述於左、第一爲中國航空公司、其資本之大部分皆仰給於美國、名義上雖屬商業上之飛行、實質則爲軍事性質之使用、此乃明白與該項條約相牴觸、倘以厦門爲根據地而開始飛行、則於最短時間可逹台灣、此爲日本國防上至堪憂慮之事實、</p>
<p>第二爲中國蘇維埃區域極形擴大、因此而被侵害、蘇維埃之發展、换言之則爲割據、中國境内屬於第三國際指導下之區域、卽有造成新共和國之可能、縱令現在無甚問題、將來必有發生問題之日、故未便以隔岸觀火視之也、</p>
<p>廣田外相答－</p>
<p>關於福建條約之中日關係、可分爲兩項、一爲不割讓土地、二爲屬於軍事上之事項、倘中國航空公司果如赤池君所談係屬於軍事性質、則牴觸該條約之第二項、但該航空分司究竟是否屬於軍事性質、亦非詳細調查不可、至謂美國與中國訂有密約、關於此點、當與軍事當局恊力盡量注意耳、關於中國之共匪、如以共產黨之理論與主張而言、固有其一貫之説、但現在中國之共</p>
<p>匪、並非如赤池君所言之情形、蓋其組織亦甚貧弱也、（六日日聨電）</p>

<p>倫敦訊、上月二十八日每日快報以大字標題、「太平洋之秘密、美國講求包抄日本統治領島之方法、」内容聲稱、此次在新加坡召集之英國遠東海軍會議、會議及英法將南太平洋之諸島賣讓與美國之問題、蓋卽美國向法國買取馬爾開薩之問題、蓋卽美國向法國買取馬爾開薩斯羣島、向英國買取瑙爾·畢士麥等島、以圖包抄日本委任統治諸島之南方、與菲列濱取連絡形勢、至其收買費、則大約將以戰債之一部分抵消之、美國計畫將此等島收買之後、卽趕築港灣與飛行塲、平時作爲商業根據地、戰時則作爲軍艦與飛機之根據地云云、此項新聞、雖不足全信、然此次新加坡會議、正在予人以一極端秘密之印象之際、此意外之記事、實引起各方面極大之衝動云、（世界社）</p>

<p>澳要人擬謀取對日貿易妥恊</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院有組織「滿洲國」英人商業委員團及調查日本水泥在香港傾銷事之建議、提出對滿商業委員團之問題者、爲保守黨道威爾大尉、海外貿易部大臣柯爾維爾答稱、一九三零年曾派商務官駐紥哈爾濱、但未幾調往北平、因北平職務較哈爾濱需要更殷也、英人在滿之商業利益、有英領署足以代表之、惟渠深知道威爾所提議者之重要、政府定將愼重注視此地位云、保守黨韓麥斯萊提出香港日人水泥傾銷事、馬爾康麥唐納（英相之子）代政府答覆、謂殖民大臣已與港督接洽此事、港督於考慮各種情形及香港貿易之特惠後、覺不宜干涉此種進口貨物、港督現盡力提倡在殖民地内儘量採用英人水泥云、路透社墨爾鉢訪電稱、在澳洲政府中身兼司法外交實業三要職之喇桑氏、定三月七日前往遠東、作三個月之遊歷、喇桑將往遊中國日本香港荷屬東印度馬來等處、並擬赴越南與菲列</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫報告</h3>
<p>蘇俄二屆五年計劃</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聨人民委員會主席莫洛托夫對第二屆五年計劃、向共黨大會作長篇報告聲稱、</p>
<p>一屆五年計劃之第一種基本政治任務、在澈底消滅資本主義成分及（一般言之）階級、完全消滅階級之劃分與剝削、克服資本主義在經濟及人民心理方面之殘留、並時蘇聨全部勞動民衆、轉變爲積極創建無階級存在之社會主義社會之締造者、第二種任務乃在增進工人及集體農民之幸福、勞動羣衆之消費標凖將增高五倍至三倍、第三個問題乃在完成整個國民經濟如工業運輸、農業等等之技術改造、</p>
<p>此三者團結而不可分割、同時得决定第二屆五年計劃中社會主義建設之實質、彼等今日在第一屆五年計劃之成功及勝利完成之基礎上得以提出、於第一屆五年計劃實行之初、蘇聨資本主義成分尙居重要地位、至第一屆五年計劃之末、則工業方面之資本主義成分、已不足道、合作社及國家之貿易已佔統治地位、故在該項實行期内、私人商務幾已完全摒絶於貿易以外、消滅鄕村區域資本主義成分之鬥爭、其困難和度則遠過之、唯在第二屆五年計劃實施之初、集體農耕制度之採用、在最重要之農業區域内已着着著效、同時富農階級已被摧除、「時至今日在榖物播種面積方面、集體及國營農塲已佔據面積百分之八四．七、故吾人可稱集體農耕制度已獲全部勝利、富農階級之殘餘、勢必作急速而最後之消滅、同時私人農塲除漸次變成集體農耕外、其道末由、」</p>
<p>莫洛托夫嗣稱、第二屆五年計劃完成時、社會主義之形式、將各部門經濟中佔得獨占地位、第二屆五年計劃之任務完成以後、蘇聨將成一結堅實的社會主義共和國云、</p>
<p>莫氏復詳論二屆五年計劃之各問題、如消滅足以產生階級歧異及人與人間剝削關係之因素、及克服經濟及羣衆心理上資本主義之殘餘等等、彼謂如欲完成此等任務、則必須以全力加强無產階級之獨裁、加强其權力與戰鬥力、並鞏固工人階級與勞動農民之聨盟、莫洛托夫述及勞動者物質與文化水平之提高時、則稱「蘇聨之失業現象已告、絶跡、工人對於明日已具充分之信念、同時隨農村貧困化之消滅、農民分化爲富農及貧農之現象亦成烏有、勞工大衆物質水平之不斷提高、以及農民大衆福利急速增高之前提、得由彼等對文化及其他需要之提高證明之、「故黨及政府已肩負此種任務、卽據張食品工業及一般經工業以提高勞苦大衆之消費標凖、」</p>
<p>二屆五年計劃之主要經濟任務、在澈底完成國民經濟技術的改造、並以此爲基礎大量擴張吾國之生產力、此項任務在各部門工業．農業．及運輸業方面、均要求其澈底完成、蘇聨於若干經濟部門雖較美國爲落後、唯於技術水平及工業生產品之總量方面、均將超過一切歐洲各國、凡此均令蘇聨與資本主義世界起本質上之變化、同時使社會主義與資本主義兩種制度之衝突、進入更新而更高之水平、第二屆五年計劃所表現之工業化政策、卽更令工業生產在全部國民生產中所占比重、益形增加、卽幾增爲百分之八十、如是則蘇聨將與世界工業化程度最高之國家如德．如美．並駕齊驅矣、</p>
<p>工業生產須較一屆五年計劃增加二．四倍、較戰前水平則將增加九倍、第一屆五年計劃時、製造生產工具的工業發展比較最速、而第二屆五年計劃中、吾人已能同時加速重工業與輕工業之發展、其在一般消費品之生產中、且已能使其作特别加速之發展、莫氏復指明各個地方及手工工業發展之必要、並列舉各最重要工業部門之任務、氏謂「第二屆五年計劃之末年、工業生產總額中須有百分之八十、乃爲第一屆及第二屆五年計劃時期内新建或完全改建之工廠所製成、同時彼時國民經濟中所用生產工具之百分之五十至六十、將於第二屆五年計劃中製成、吾人已肩荷此種任務、卽以吾國自製之工具、完成技術之改造、」莫氏詳述機械工業之成就、此項工業已爲各部門工業製造各種機器、其生產數量在全世界機器生產中已自一九二八年之百分之四、增爲一九三三年之百分之二一．四、莫氏述及電氣化時、謂蘇聨就所生產之電流量而論、將占世界第二位、氏復列述第二屆五年計劃中煤油．煤炭．泥炭及化學工業、以及鋼鐵及其他冶金工業之預期的發展狀况、莫氏述及輕工業時、則稱第二屆五年計劃令一般消費品之生產增加三倍、同時第二屆五年計劃終了時、蘇聨於技術設置之水平上將佔世界首位、在食品工業生產量方面、將在佔歐洲首位、氏特别重視各種工業、均須以改進生產物物質量爲注意中心點也、</p>
<p>莫氏論農業生產云、組織時期確有巨大困難、現則私人經營改爲集體農耕之過程、大體已告完成、故農業之上升、已有不可比擬之優越條件、第二屆五年計劃内農業總生產、將大量增加、一九三七年將逹一一○．五六○．○○○噸、而一九三二年持爲六九．八七○．○○○噸、第二屆五年計劃並未規定播種面積之激增、主要問題乃在作物產量之增加、畜牧方面亦有十分緊要之問題、第二屆五年計劃規定牲畜頭數須大量增加「吾人爲欲令農業有急速之上升、必須令鞏固集體及國營農塲之經濟的基礎、</p>
<p>莫洛托夫旋述運輸業之最主要之任務、一九三七年之貨物運輸量如與一九三二年相較、則增加如下述、鐵路百分之一七八、河道運輸百分之二四五、海道運輸百分之二八○、爲完成此處極增加計、則運輸業特别爲鐵道之技術的改造、須視爲中心問題也、彼復備述計劃内規定運輸業方面之工作、如烏拉爾古茲湼茲克頓湼茲煤區、外貝加爾及烏蘇里鐵道等、均敷設雙軌、採用自動區劃信號方法、增加車輛及增鐵道等、（貝加爾至阿穆爾之幹綫工程浩大異常重）凡此所云、均欲令今日運輸業較諸國民經濟之一般發展爲落後之現象歸爲烏有也、莫氏嗣述及發展水道之工作、彼謂自窩瓦河至莫斯科之運河（長一二七公里）已在疏濬、自窩瓦河至頓河之運河（長一○○公里）亦將於第二屆五年計劃期内築成、屆時蘇聨之歐洲部分將有偉大之水道系統矣、莫氏復列舉重修並改建河道及海道運輸．</p>
<p>發展汽車及航空交通．建築新公路．發展無線電交通等等之方案、莫氏力稱技術改造之實施、須有爭取生產技術方面之鬭爭、　　莫氏述及勞工問題、謂二屆五年計劃終了時、工業勞動之效率將增百分六三、生產費將减百分二六、工廠附設學校將畢業熟練工人二百七十萬人、農專校將有訓練農業勞動者一百五十萬人、在五年内參加工業之新經訓練之工人將有五百萬人、大學畢業之專家亦將增加、科學及技術工作則繼續發展、莫氏謂「吾人已自國外技術學及國外專家處所獲已良多、此等功課並未忘却、故吾人在科學及技術方面已有多數新人材、吾人在第二屆五年計劃中將多多憑藉於吾國民經濟技術改造中蘇聨技術之成就也、凡此必能使蘇聨之生產力有急激發展、此種發展乃任何資本主義國家所未經見者、第二屆五年計劃終了時、蘇聨在就生產而論、其在世界列强間之地位將形大變、蓋第一屆五年計劃之前夜、蘇聨生產佔世界第五位、第二屆五年計劃之前夜、已佔全世界第三位、在歐洲佔第二位、第二屆五年計劃終了時、蘇聨將躍居世界生產之第二位、在歐洲將鰲居首位、在經濟及技術方面趕及並超過資本主義國家之任務、將於實踐中實現矣、</p>
<p>莫氏述及建設工作及生產力之重新分配事、則指明蘇聨生產力之更正確的分配、全國工廠之更平均的配置、使工業得與原料供給地及電力來源相接近等等、俱爲第二屆五年計劃中投資計劃之特色、國民經濟各部門投資總額將逹一三三．○○○．○○○．○○○盧布、而第一屆五年計劃中僅有五○．○○○．○○○．○○○盧布、工業方面之投資將逹六九．○○○．○○○．○○○盧布、農業方面將自第一屆五年計劃中之九十萬萬盧布、增爲一百五十萬萬盧布、於此五年内將有新設機器製造廠九十四家開工、</p>
<p>莫氏述及勞動大衆物質與文化生活水平之提高彼謂工人之地位在第一屆五年計劃中已急劇改進、一失業之消滅、以及吾國工人對於明日之不須憂慮、卽此已有最大之價値矣、同時農民之地位亦有重要之變化、昔日之農村、其貧困程度之加深有如江河日下、今日則其地位逐日增進、吾人已無失業之危險矣、反之、五年以内雇佣人數已增加百分之二十九、工人亦無每日工作同過長之威脅、反之、每日工作時間已减爲七小時、在更艱難之工作條件下、則减爲六小時以下、」莫氏論及工人及雇員之收入時、特别注意於實際工資之提高、計劃中此種工資將增加一位、全部工資基金在五年内將自三百二十萬萬盧布、增爲五百十萬萬盧布、工人及雇員之平均工資將增加百分之二二、</p>
<p>第二屆五年計劃中規定文盲須澈底消滅、並將普遍採用實施工藝强迫教育、教員及學生之總數將大有增加、一切幼童均得入幼稚園、其餘如俱樂部．圖書館．無綫電台．科學研究所．及科學工作人員等、均將激增、莫氏復詳述衛生事業之改進、居住面積之擴充以及城鄕工人供給之增進等、每人平均主要物品之消費量、於五年内將增加二倍半至三倍、工業物品之平均消費量亦將增加、</p>
<p>莫氏嗣將蘇聨與資本主義國家之地位加以比較、乃曰、「自一九二八至一九三二年、英國之國民收入减少百分之一六．九、唯蘇聨之國民收入則於同期增加百分之三二、資本主義國家旣無五年計劃、又無清楚之目標、彼等之領袖决不能企圖卽在五年以後、恢復一九二八年之水平、蘇聨之地位則異是、吾人有清晰之遠景、正如第二屆五年計劃已經規定者、吾人將不斷急激增加吾人之國民總收入、卽吾人須將執行此項任務、令此項收入如與一九三二年比較增加百分之一三八、如與一九二三年比較則將增加百分之三三二」、（六日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>英國建造</h3>
<p>新式軍用飛機</p>
<p>（倫敦）據「每日郵報」載稱、航空部頃下令建造具有兩舵之雙推進翼飛機一架、其式樣較諸拉西愛瓦（西班牙發明家卽雙推進翼之發明者）式飛機更爲闊大、據該報謂此項飛機、經海陸軍認爲在軍略上有重要價値、蓋此機一方面能在空中停駐、幾完全不動、於從事偵察時極有用處、另一方面則其飛行速率、又幾與平常飛樣相等故也云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>巴爾幹公約</h3>
<p>性質屬於防禦</p>
<p>雅典各報對巴爾幹半島恊商公約之草簽熱烈贊成、謂按照該約、各簽字國相互保障者僅爲各該國在巴爾幹半島之公共邊境、其防禦必質甚爲明顯、此約將於星期四下午在雅典研究院正式簽字、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）巴爾幹約商公約草簽之後、土耳其政府當卽與希臘政府進行談判、擬由兩國另訂關税同盟以補充之、據聞土耳其經濟部長不日卽赴雅典、以便將關税同盟條約草案加以整理、並希望巴爾幹恊商公約、其他簽字國亦能仿照辦理云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>蘇菲亞此間半官界已宣布保加利亞對希臘．土耳其．羅馬尼亞．南斯拉夫四國所締結巴爾幹公約之態度、據稱、保加利亞願意在國聨機構内及遵照凱洛非戰公約加入不在侵犯條約、蓋此爲鞏固巴爾幹和平之最佳方法云、消息靈通各界現皆謂保加利亞之所以不加入巴爾幹公約者、實因不能獲得某種讓與權、如逹愛琴海之走廊類、致有所不滿之故、但保加利亞被勸簽字、藉固該約效率之希望、今尙未放棄、非正式之談話、現已在進行中、以期逹此目的、聞新約規定諸國經濟上與政治上之合作、並反對凡爾賽和約之修正、故不啻爲巴爾幹之洛迦諾公約云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）巴爾幹恊商公約草簽之消息傳至此間、一般人干甚爲歡迎、負責方面謂、該公約與法國素抱之政策相符、在今以前、巴爾幹爲歐洲最爲混亂之地帶、公約告成、則半島風雲可告平息矣、説者又謂巴爾幹半島各國之重歸於好、實出於各該國之自願、故公約之訂立、實出於各該國之自動、此與法國素來主張之尊重各國主權原則、適相符合云（五日哈瓦斯</p>
<p>倫敦此間人士對於巴爾幹恊商公約、行將簽字一事雖表示滿意、但對於保加利亞不參加所謂「東方羅卡洛條約」一層、則守緘默、下午衆議院開會、有人詢問政府、對於此約如何訓令駐在外國之各代表表示態度、外相西門答稱、「政府已令駐在各關係國之代表通知各駐在國政府、謂已爾幹半島各國爲謀一般平和而訂立之公約、英國政府均表贊成、惟以此項公約不反對任何國家或任何集團國家爲條件、因此希望巴爾幹恊商公約條文斟酌盡善、俾保加利亞亦能加入」云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>金融界調查滬商界</h3>
<p>尙能勉强維持</p>
<p>外傳有大批停閉説</p>
<p>認爲傳者過甚其辭</p>
<p>中央社云、外傳廢歷年關將届、本巿商界、有一部份因金融周轉不靈、勢將停閉、並稱南京路一帶、竟有數十家大商店、將於此時封閉等云云、據中央社記者昨晨向本埠金融界方面探悉、此種傳説、實屬過甚其辭、蓋近年來經濟之恐慌、非中國一國爲然、亦非上海一埠蒙此影響、各地金融界、以及工商界、每逢冬節、循例總結賬目、當然有極少數之商店、因金融關係、發生債務糾紛、甚至停業、此係常有之事、本届廢歷年關、上海一埠、當然亦將有此種事件發現、據金融界調查、認本年廢歷年關、上海金融界及商界之經濟恐慌狀况、已較去年略呈佳象、大部份均能勉强維持過去云、</p>
<h3>招商去年營業</h3>
<p>收入八百萬僅抵開支</p>
<p>債息二百十萬須籌欵</p>
<p>中央社云、國營招商局秘書蔣山談、該局去年營業收入雖較上年增加二百萬元、共計八百萬元、但開支亦約八百萬元、故收支相抵外、所負債務二千餘萬元之息金、每年二百十萬元、尙須籌欵撥付、劉總經理前曾呈部請撥欵清理、由行政院議决、交全國經委會籌畫、此次該會在京舉行第三次常委會時、雖曾提及此案、但如何决定、尙未獲悉、招商局現在營業經積極整頓後、收入已較前增加、但負債過鉅、而一切設備均須添修、故勉敷開支、無力擴充云、又該局在英定建之海輪四艘、已决定共需英金三十四萬一千七百鎊、超出預算甚鉅、故江輪減建一艘、尙有不敷、蓋英庚借欵最多爲四十萬鎊、内除海輪建費、所餘不足六萬鎊、乃江輪每艘材料費亦須四萬、故不敷至鉅、仍須設法籌畫云、</p>
<h3>京滬路加開</h3>

<h3>日米運華傾銷</h3>
<p>事實上極因難</p>
<p>國人當加注意</p>
<p>中央社云、本巿前傳有大批國米運往東北、近并傳日本將有大批糧食運來中國傾銷之説、記者以此事關係甚大、特向各關係方面探詢眞相、探錄各情如下、</p>
<p>米商方面消息據糧食商方面探得消息、以爲自前年國内豐收、内地均有剩餘米囤積、去年收成雖不若前年、但以累年囤積者、一時推銷不易、以致米價狂跌、爲數年來所僅見、農民所受痛苦固深、而商人亦極感困頓、政府有鑒於斯、爰有征收洋米進口税之舉、蓋歷年來洋米在國内傾銷、亦爲使米價狂跌之一大原因、自政府開始徵收洋米税以來、洋米入口、確見减少、至於日來將大批運往中國傾銷、事實上亦爲一極困難之事、而華商對於日米、亦决無代爲承銷之力云、</p>
<p>當局方面消息又據巿社會局方面所得消息、對於國米向東北推銷一事、經派員調查、迄今無從證實、以目前國内米糧價格狂跌、欲求提高價格、除注意國内米糧調節外、並應設法向國外推銷、則米價或有高漲之望、至於日米來華傾銷一節、因日本原非產米之國、其國内米價、平時亦較中國爲高、今中國米價狂跌、日米來華傾銷、决無利可圖、但日方或另有所　圖、中國政府與米商、以安定米巿起見、當加以注意云、</p>

<h3>絲銷漸動價格見漲</h3>
<p>各絲廠凖備開工</p>
<p>連日復業者已有十餘家</p>
<p>廢歷年關後將陸續開車</p>
<p>大公社云、本巿單雙宮繅絲廠、共計一零八家、自去年入秋以來、因絲巿暴跌、銷路呆滯、以致各廠無法維持、幾至全部停車、現歐美絲銷、漸形活動、春繭亦將上塲、故各絲廠俟度過廢歷年關後、卽將陸續開車、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>開工見增</h3>
<p>本巿繅絲廠、閘北區新閘橋長安路一帶、共有單宮繅絲廠約五十餘家、雙宮絲廠五家、虹口區天同路香烟橋一帶、有單宮絲廠十七家、雙宮絲廠二家、滬西區曹家渡一帶、有單宮絲廠八家、租界區阿拉白司脱路一帶、有單宮絲廠五家、滬南區打浦橋日暉港一帶、亦有絲廠四家、總計全巿單雙宮絲廠共有一零八家、去年春夏兩季、開車者逹六十餘家、自入秋後、因絲價暴跌、銷路呆滯、以致難以維持、遂相繼停車勉强開工者僅三數家而已、現絲銷漸形活動、價格亦略有起色、故虹口區永亨．祥盛　．福倫恒．閘北區亦有源信．積餘．楚信．租界區經緯．南區寳泰等十餘廠、已先後開車、恢復工作、</p>
<p>絲價略漲</p>
<p>各廠出品之白經絲、去年五六月中、每包可售九百元以上、黃廠經亦可售八百元左右、川廠經可售七百元以外、自入秋後、漸趨低落、每包僅售五百元左右、以致每包須虧蝕二百餘元、各廠不得已、乃將出品各貨押存銀行、現歐銷漸動、絲價亦較前略爲提高、現巿最高白廠經、每包可售六百元左右、其他如川廠經等、亦可售五百元以上、故各廠對絲銷前途、頗見樂觀、將謀逐漸開車、以維業務、</p>
<p>各廠準備</p>
<p>大公社記者、昨訪絲業界中人、詢以本巿各絲廠開車日期、據稱絲銷已見活動後、本巿各廠、已凖備陸續開車、惟最近因廢歷年關將届、銀根奇緊、難免週轉不靈、故俟度過年關後、各廠卽將先後開車、惟絲業危機已深、亟盼絲業統制會、早謀根本救濟辦法、使將我國唯一之絲業、不致瀕於破產、而有來蘇之望也云云</p>

<p>國聞社云、海軍政次兼第一艦隊司令陳季良氏、因閩變率艦直閩、坐鎭福州、現閩省主席陳儀等已經就職、此後負責有人、原擬返來、詎至本月二日、陳忽患病、病勢且劇、致外間遂有被刺之謠傳、記者昨日下午五時、往晤負責滬港之練隊司令王壽廷氏、叩詢謠傳情形、據王氏謂、被刺之説、全非信史、現陳司令已乘海容艦、於本日午刻十一時離馬尾來滬、預計後（卽明日）晨可抵滬、至於其病狀經過、蓋陳司令此次因閩變前往指揮、昕夕無暇、操勞過度、致有此恙、當二日上午、陳司令忽感不適、且脅痛異常、其時陳司令尙住楚泰艦上、至三日、體更疲憊、卽轉送南台博生醫院、經診斷結果、認爲肺炎、至四日益重、於是由楚泰蕯艦長報告海部、山部長陳紹寛、令本埠海軍軍醫顧問陳澄雇得航空公司飛機一架飛閩、爲陳診視、此爲五日之事、於是日上午十時半出發、午後、卽得陳顧問之覆電、謂陳司令並非肺炎、蓋陳司令之肺胃各部、均甚完好、今在艦療治不便、且原擬返滬、故承醫生之囑、决搭海容艦返滬、天約後（卽明日）晨可抵滬、到滬後、當然須有長期間之治療也、外間所俾種種、全屬謠傳云云、</p>

<h3>長江水勢又减</h3>
<p>航路更難暢通</p>
<p>長江水勢、自一月十五日後、突然减退、馬當到過八尺九寸、及至五日、江漢關將新港解禁、藉通航路、詎料昨日、水又下退、江輪仍難行駛、茲將詳情再誌如下、</p>
<p>新港水又退落</p>
<p>馬當在小姑山附近、江水最淺時、退至八尺九寸、各江輪均遭阻礙、江漢關曾將該處新港封閉、不准船行、迨至本月五日、經江漢關測量結果、馬當新港、水位有十尺四寸、較老港爲大、在吃水十尺左右之船、可以通行、詎料昨日午後、滬上各輪公司、又得漢口電告、馬當新港、甫經解禁通航、而江水又退、至昨日已降至九尺八寸、較大之輪、裝貨難通、仍須用駁拖底而過、</p>
<p>龍平亦告水淺</p>
<p>九江以上水勢、本較上游爲大、在馬當减水時期、龍平大燄山一帶江水、常在十尺五寸左右、詎料昨日、滬上得報、龍平之水、此兩天中、忽然降落、祗有十尺、江漢關已發通告、限制上水江輪運貨不得超過十尺、故本埠六公司之長江船、仍祗得裝儎三分之一、如稍多運、便須用駁轉卸、十分周折、</p>
<p>擱淺船難脱險</p>
<p>三北長興輪、在馬當老港擱淺者、至今已逹一週、屢拖無效、迄未脱險、昨日、該公司連接兩電報告、船内煤片與食用物料等、均完請公司迅予接濟、因該輪尙無拖救出淺之望、船内現留憲兵護航、至於在上江擱阻之各輪、昨得新堤消息、水勢仍祇五尺、各輪多陷沙泥中、一時難望救出、幸邇日長江上下游進出口貨、均異常缺乏、殊無大批貨裝載也、</p>
<h3>修訂</h3>
<p>美棉借欵合同</p>
<p>我國政府向美國借欵購買之棉麥、自去冬開裝以來、美麥已到全數三分之一、棉祇到十六分之一、現因棉花去路甚少、未便裝運來華、賠貼棧租、遂有要求美國當局修改合同之舉、記者將所得消息、分述如下、</p>
<h3>美麥到十二船</h3>
<p>美麥自上年十二月十八日起、先後由波特蘭經招商局委托總代表諾登列蘭公司Norton　Lilley　Co;運載來華、計七個星期中、共到十二船、（連昨到之哈勃羅當號輪八．九○○噸、）總計已運到九萬三千七百七十二噸、以全部三十萬噸計、已到三分之一、此十二船中、有一輪載七千二百噸、卸往南京、歸揚子麵粉廠購買外、餘十一船、均在滬卸下、每噸售價、平均爲七十元、其已到之麥、値六百五十六萬四千元、</p>
<h3>麵粉尙未起運</h3>
<p>借欵美麥内、議定有麵粉一部、其數額变有六七萬噸、自新税公布以後、財部訂進口税、麥每擔爲關金三角、麥粉每擔須關金七五、合國幣在一元九角餘、依照滬上現售粉價、每包約售二元二角、如美粉進口、連同關税、其成本至少在二元六七角、因與巿價不合、故借欵麵粉、尙未電令起運、僅上月密弗大來輪中、載來一小批、現决先續運美麥、蓋每擔進口成本合各項費用、亦不過四元二三角、而易於出售也、尙有二十萬噸貨、限在一百四十餘日内、務須運畢、</p>
<h3>棉花合同修改</h3>
<p>借欵美棉、總數爲八十萬件、占四十萬噸、値美金四千萬元、原訂借欵合同、須在本年六月三十日以前、全數運完、詎自上年十一月十七日起、首批運到後、至今將逹三月、陸續運來上海者、不過五萬件、占全數不過十六分之一、而我國對此美棉、主張售去一批、運裝一批、殊不願先裝到滬、擔負重大棧租等費、近因國内棉花去路不暢、合同期限、六月底轉瞬卽届、勢難如限售畢、故我國已經决定、對於美棉之借欵合同、向美當局提出修改、將期限展寛、延長半年或若干月、以利售銷、刻下此事已經向美政府請求、聞已得美力同意、正在議修合同中</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論學習語文（二）</h3>
<p>從程君來信中，我們以爲有很重要兩點還得與程君商確：第一，學習文字是否應讀古文；第二，學習語文是否單憑習讀文字所可奏效。</p>
<p>誠然，離了語文我們不能表逹我們自己的與了解他人的思想。然而語文之爲用．仍不過是一種工具，－思想的工具。所以學習語文之目的，卽是使傳逹思想的媒介的運用更加靈活，亦卽程君所希望者。</p>
<p>「語言」與「文字」有别。思想的傳逹的媒介所不可缺的，並非「文字」而是「語言」，因爲有許多地方單有「語言」而無「文字」，但思想却仍然是存在的。（參看文學雜誌創刊號陳望道的關於文學的諸問題。不過陳所論者係「語言」「文字」和文學的關係，此虚則更推衍其說，泛論「思想」，）</p>
<p>文字的產生在「語言」之後，但「文字」却必須與「語言」一致．如不一致，則此種「文字」定非一活的文字而難免鬼話之　。因爲我們平常思考事，定以其所熟習的語言來思想，如我們看見友人到　處去，而想問問他到那裹，那在心中所轉念的問句是「你到什麽地方去？」但是如果我們不是口頭問答，而是用書信卽文字來問，若這時要用「古話」，那必定要將這問句譯成「子將何之」之類。由此我們可以知道，如果「文字」與「語言」不一致，那把思想變做文字．定要經過三個步驟。思想－當時的語言－古代的語言。這意思就是指我們若用古文，那思想的傳逹就要多一道手續，須將我們所思想的習常的語言譯成，古代的語言，不能卽照我們所思想到的語言直接寫在紙上。古文精熟的人，自然是不要經過這樣繁重手續的，他們已把「古代語言」習得純熟，能用古代語言思考。但是他們的學習是要化多少工夫啊！所以在以前，一般人學習了日常的語言之後，並不以寫文字，必須再學習古　代的語言，實際上，這好像是要學習兩種語言。但如用了語體文，這種困難恐怕就不致產生了。因爲我們所要說的話，馬上就可寫在紙上。就學習上講，這是我們不贊成讀古文的第一個原因。</p>
<p>現在有許多人說，我們固然贊成用語體文，但是學語體文却須從讀古文入手，不看見現在許多做語體文極好的人嗎，他們對於古文，那個沒有基礎，那個不會做。這是一種似是而非的見解。我們現在學古文是學些什麽，學做古文嗎？當然不是的；從古文裹去得些文章技巧嗎，這也是空話。姚鼐以爲從古文中所要學到的不外乎「格律聲色，神理氣味」。我們現在學「格律聲色麽，那旣不做古文，則這種僅能應用於古文的「格律聲色」學他做甚；現代　的文法，結構，旣與古文不同，學了古文的腔調又有何用。古文的「神，理。氣，味，」也無學的必要，「神理氣味」並非古文所專有，我們的現代文中何嘗沒有神理氣味，又何必硬要從古文中去學習，揣摩。總之：文學的美質卽如姚鼐所說的陽剛陰柔，此乃凡是文章都應具有的，古文中固有，英文中也有．法文中也有，我們存了這種目的去學習，則研究古文，與研究法文：：：又有什麽分别。</p>
<p>另一派人雖不作上列主張，但爲了要使初學的人字彚加大等起見，勸人去讀「莊子」「文　選」等古書古文。這也是不能適合病情的藥方。此種論爭文字在去年度本報自出談上發表頗多，其中理由是非，讀者可自行參考，不再贅述。現在出說這種主張的缺項。目前擴大學生認識的字彚，確是需要；但不是向古書中去找。這一方面要學生勤於多翻字典辭書將其中活的字彚來運用。同時要把外來的，科學上新造的，社會生活中正流行而未「成文」的，一併加入，擴大現代的活的字彚這才是眞正的出路。在莊子文選中的字，確有不秒是現在一般人所不認識的，但這些字卽使認識了，在語言中，在文字中，又有什麽用處？所以從訓練文字的技巧上講，我們也無習讀古文，而單是要能如意地表出我的意思學習古文是殊無必要。（未完）</p>

<h3>保障兒童是我們的責任</h3>
<p>— 胡沉舟</p>
<p>那眞是中國的兒童們的福音呵，有人提議：「保障兒音是我們的責任」！大街上，牆上，電桿子上都貼着那麽花花緑緑的標語並且决定了今年是「发兒童年」。</p>
<p>「兒童年」！這使我想起我的幼年來啦！我－不不只是我一個子，是我們的大多數的羣衆－過着黑暗的，飢寒的，倚賴的兒童時代。那時候我們的生活是屬谥我們的大人們的，還受着他們的抑制：祗一點兒童有安定的，充實的，光明的生活，充滿了愛情跟遊戲的哩。</p>
<p>這種現象是繼續着，繼續着：：：一直到今年是「兒童年」；「保障兒童是我們的責任」！它凖會不存在了（？）我想。</p>
<p>現在我們的任務是保障勞苦的兒童！在那世襲富庶跟有敎養的家庭裹的不需要我們的保障。</p>
<p>保障勞苦的兒童：廢止童工制度：（那些在紗廠裹當打盆的稍稍不留心工作，就給拿了滾水望腦袋上，身上儘潑，於是就暴起了大大小小的泡兒來，還被命令着不准哭！那店舖子裹的學生子習慣地受着店主子的毒刑：拷打，炮烙，：：：那些常常挨駡挨打的公館裹的大姐兒們：：：）。嚴禁販賣兒童：（那些萬惡的販條子的：譬如：從上海，寗波，等等地方拐了大夥兒的孩子們帶到厦門，汕頭去賣把那些點有錢的！在這兒誰有頂多的婢女，誰就是頂有錢的！那情形好像美國在黑奴解放運動以　，一些資產階級對於他們的黑奴的態度。……………………）。救濟勞苦的兒童（那些不論夏天或冬天，晴天或雨天，老拾　爛東西的，患着都巿蒼白症的兒童，……………………）</p>
<h3>死尋開心與死出風頭</h3>
<p>— 朱人一</p>
<p>「死」對於生人，終是有點恐怖的。然而，奇怪得很，現在竟有人到死字頭上去尋開心了，大約是世界上的樂事都被開心完了，但人們定要找出再新奇的樂事來開心，於是尋到了死字頭上去。這是、多麽有趣的滑稽劇！</p>
<p>二十世紀的人們，風頭也是出足了，從空中到海底，從戰塲到舞塲，從出洋到下鄕，從革命到唸佛：終於轉到了死字頭上去，死也要出風頭。又是一椿多麽有趣的滑稽劇！</p>
<p>只要你翻開隨便那一張大報來看，總有死的新聞登載着。舉兩椿例子罷：</p>
<p>有一雙年輕的男女，因戀愛不自由，故一同死了。他們的方法是從電燈上引兩根花綫到床上，繫着各人的一隻腿，於是扭了機鈕，就此觸電了結。</p>
<p>還有一個人，他死的方法是先把棺材買了來，架空着，底下開一個洞，地上放一隻煤爐，對凖洞口，燒起煤來；於是他爬進棺材，移上了蓋，讓煤氣毒死。</p>
<p>這是死尋開凡！</p>
<p>某某和尙，年少時曾留學某國，得博士學位，歸國後歷任軍政要職，後因看穿塵世，專心修養唸經；現將於　月中圓寂。於是號召了無數的信徒。</p>
<p>某君情塲失戀，負債甚巨，無法再維持生活，不得意而决心去「死」，預作遺書一封，大意謂：國人甘心墮落，暴日侵凌，不加抵抗，余不忍目覩祖國之淪亡，故此自殺，欲以警醒同胞，共起救國也。於是報上大鼓大吹，人皆贊嘆不已！</p>
<p>是之謂死出風頭！</p>
<p>活人要去尋死的開心，出死的風頭，這是目光遠大啊！君不見乎………</p>
<h3>都巿的呼聲</h3>
<p>— 軼霄</p>
<p>大都巿的上海，在一般未到過上海的人，總是懷着：「偉大的神秘的消金窟」的幻想，等你一踏進這大都巿的上海，你就覺得這裏面藏着的，竟是些悲哀．墮落，痛苦，……不斷的呼聲！</p>
<p>清早睡在床上，就聽到：</p>
<p>「小白菜哪……青菜，蘿葡……」</p>
<p>這聲音總是凄凄的，切切的：無形中會給你陣難過，一霎又接着一陣：</p>
<p>「申報，新聞報，時報，時事新報！</p>
<p>……」的粗暴的聲音。</p>
<p>中午了，聲音也漸漸的複雜起來，悲的哀的：重的輕的：沙的破的，轟轟的在街頭弄口沸騰，那種生活的喊呌，你實在無法使你腦子安寗一息，卽使走在街頭散步，那般　樓的孩子，衰病的老丐，會追隨在你後面：</p>
<p>「先生，少爺……做點好事吧！……」的一陣亂呌。晚上比較安寗一點吧？眞點，確是安寗一些－但，不久那種呼聲會在寂靜的夜裹幽幽的弄堂，又打動你的心弦：</p>
<p>「橄欖……檀香橄欖呵……買橄欖……」這聲音總是清晰的，宛轉的，比什麽音樂都自然，不久又聽到：</p>
<p>殼……破竹敲出的嘶聲，接着又是：「火燭小心！……」短短促促的沙聲，由遠漸近，由近漸遠……</p>
<p>深夜我又被一種聲音驚醒，寥寥的聽到：</p>
<p>「火腿　子，……」</p>
<p>「猪油來沙百寳飯，五香茶葉蛋……」</p>
<p>我住在上海，已經十年了，每天總是悲哀的醒，悲哀的睡，半夜還要悲哀的驚！</p>
<p>「都巿的呼聲，都巿的呼聲！…」你幾時才在我耳邊消滅？</p>
<h3>乾凈與齷齪</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>最近，我遇到了一位多年不見的老友。於酒酣耳熱之餘，他同我大談其乾凈與齷齪，使我面爲之赤，因爲我也是中國人。</p>
<p>我的朋友住在上海虹口某路。他的隣舍，除了中國人外，還有不少日本人。他告訴我說：「你如果要知道這區域内那一家住的是中國人，那末你祇消一看後門口有沒有垃圾堆積便得。」這句話，已覺使我做中國人的聽之，有些難以爲情了。他又說：「倘使你在一條里内巡禮一下，你便可看到有好多人家的玻窗上都塵灰藏翳，一若屋中空關已久者；這些住户，可以不問而知一定又都是我們中國人。還有，從　間或電燈罩，亦可辦出屋内住户的國籍。」</p>
<p>接着，我的朋友又談起洗澡的事，他是無日不浴的。據他說，號稱文物之邦的某省某大商埠的婦女，是永年不洗澡的；並且不但永年不洗澡，就是伊們的下部也不敢一洗的。因爲洗下部這件事，如果被人知道了，洗者將蒙着「賣淫」的不白之寃。誰願擔這惡名聲？所以伊們也祗好任那下部一天一天地齷齪起來了。我的朋友說畢，還頻頻搖頭不置。</p>
<p>他又告訴我說：「有一位西洋人游遍了東亞的日本朝鮮中國後，對人發表其感想，略謂：西洋人是内外都乾凈的，日本人是外齷齪而内乾凈的，朝鮮人是外乾凈而内齷齪的，惟有中國人則内外俱是齷齪的。」按「内」與「外」，是指身體與衣服而言，所謂内齷齪者，當然與洗澡也有關係。</p>
<p>最後，我的朋友對我說道：「從乾凈與齷齪，可以見出一國的國民性。」我聽了這一席話，臉也紅了，祗好呆呆地想。</p>

<p>趙翁不摸鬍子了，挺着胸脯提高了聲音道：你當了這些日子的軍人，怎麽還是這樣兒女情長。我這一把老骨頭，你是知道的十分康健。你岳母和你女人，有我照應着，只有比從前更舒適的。這一些你都不必過問，好好的去當你的連長。好漢是人做的，大事也是由人做的，並沒有什麽神仙下界來替人民辦事。說到這裏，將聲音低了兩低道：女人的心腸，那總是軟的，你要做出那毫不在乎的樣子來，才可以提起他們的精神。若是你自己就這樣愁眉苦臉的，他們不曉得軍營裏的事，那豈不更要着慌？自强微笑道：我倒並不怎樣的發急，只是我瞧他心裏有些很難過的樣子，我就不知道用什麽話去安慰人家好。趙翁道：你這呌傻話了。彼些要離别了，那總是心裏難受的。你只有用好言語去安慰他，說不久相會，那才是對的。你也像他一般，那不透着更難分難捨嗎？我就是這幾句話，你好好的聽着去想想罷，趙翁說完了，急忙回到自己屋子去撇了自强一個人站在堂屋裏。他本來想到前面院子裏去，安慰岳母幾句的。然而他總沒有那種勇氣，脚向前走了幾步，依然走回來。老站在堂屋裏，又怕父親要出來敎訓自己，索興一轉身，縮進新房去了。一個人坐在椅子上，兩隻手撑住桌沿託了頭。自己這樣沉沉的坐着，也不知道經過了多少時候，只聽到脚步很重的，有人進來了。立刻將身子坐端正了，看時，桂枝笑嘻嘻的，帶跳帶跑的走進屋子來。看那樣子，自然是高興極了。（二四○）</p>
<h3>蘇州茶事的雜話</h3>
<p>— 張郁明</p>
<p>（一）茶產我們中國產茶的地方．最負盛名的，如安徽的「六安」；福建的「武夷」．但人們很鮮少注意到蘇州的「洞庭東山」和「西山」，也產有茶中雋品；名呌「碧羅春」，光福之「鄧尉山」，亦產有所謂「本山雨前」，以上兩種產品，每年約有六七百担之多，「碧羅春」茶，約佔其六七分一，是種名茶，土人採之，售諸茶商，每斤亦不過取價七八角云，可謂廉極，經烘製之後，煮之以清泉，則香清雋永，不同凡品，依照傳統陸羽盧同的朋友講起來，蘇州所產的「碧羅春」茶，其香清味醇，誠不亞于所謂「獅峯」「鐵觀音」等名品。</p>
<p>（二）茶商蘇州因爲產茶的緣故，所以茶業在蘇州，也當然佔有商業上的一個重要單位，統計蘇城大規模的「茶行」．「茶棧」，與「茶店」，約有四十餘處之多，其中最餆有歷史，而雄于資本的，當推「吳韾記」「鮑德潤」「吳世美」「汪瑞裕」「仇震漋」等號．「吳韾記」之茶，多傾銷山東省，諸地，如「濟寗」「濟南」等處，「鮑德潤」之出品，係最暢銷于「沂州」等地，「汪瑞裕」附設品苟茗處，假諸宣傳之力，因此，亦頗能執蘇州本埠茶業之牛耳，「仇震漋」之茶，于蘇鄕銷路上，亦有相當的威權。以上各茶商，每年營業數量，均能逾有二十萬元巨大的金額</p>
<p>（三）花茶名震中外的蘇州虎丘，其附近的居民多以蒔植花木爲業「玳玳花」尤是虎丘風景區内特產的一種，玳玳花蕾，經烘製之後，可以泡茶，倘與茶共煮則可助茶味，馥郁而芬芳，出外人士，來遊虎丘者，莫不知「玳玳花茶」之盛名也。是種花茶，每年銷售于外埠，爲數甚夥，歐美人士，尤喜購爲饋贈之品。</p>
<p>（四）茶苑蘇州的茶苑，實是繁多，其較爲有名的，城裏，有「吳苑」「蓬灜」「三萬昌」「汪瑞裕」等處，城外，又有「長安」「福安」等茶苑，不過，最奇怪的，一班茶客，并沒有受過什麽令命的限制，而他們確自動的，劃分得非常清楚，如汪瑞裕的茶客，多係報館記者先生與一班小學敎師，吳苑之「愛竹居」「話雨樓」品茗處的茶客多半係吳下資產階級者．城外，「福安」「長安」兩茶苑，廣集了業的大小商人，誠不啻是蘇州的分門别類變相的交易所，還有蘇州公園的「東齋」與「西亭」在溽暑炎炎的夏日，茶肆的營業，也是非常鼎盛，良以姑蘇的摩登女郎，沒有舞塲與游泳池去遣興，往往在公園中品茗，藉以享受習習的凉風；一班色情狂的青年，也恒以喫茶爲名，而實行其追逐的勾當．不過，到了秋盡冬來的現在，那一班顧客，已經改弦更張了，而「東齋」「西亭」．也像昆蟲般作一度之冬眠了，又期待着炎夏再來，再事活動，還有每屆舊歷新年，崇尙吉利的蘇州仁兄，每喜聨袂接踵的，趨赴「長安」「福安」去品茗，他們的意義，以爲，一屆歲首，飲了「長安」之茗，可以長樂安平，登了福安茶樓，可以福體安康，倘使事實果如人願，我們的政府執政仁兄，也請他們光臨蘇州的「長安」「福安」，一品吉利之茶，那我們中國，豈不是將國泰民安了嗎？</p>
<p>（五）講茶有一班日裹喫太陽，夜裹喫月亮的英雄，他們，也會學步政治家的植黨立派，雄視各方，倘使他們問，發生了什麽爭執，慣會借茶苑爲評論是非曲直之所，在不得要領之時，也會頓時地肉搏起來，這種「喫讲茶」的風氣，現在却很少看見了，也許是他們是服膺了非戰主義，而覺悟了，不再同類相殘，蘇州茶苑的主人，却也因此减少了多少無妄之災！</p>

<h3>漢巿敎育現狀</h3>
<p>公私立學校共一百五十八所</p>

<p>小學不發逹兒童五萬人失學</p>
<p>漢口通信、漢巿敎育向不發逹、文盲佔全人口十分之八以上、公私立學校、共僅一百五十八所而經費艱窘、積弊孔多、擴充整頓、實屬刻不容緩、頃據巿長吳國楨公表、全巿敎育機關、以等級分有中學．小學．幼稚園．職業學校．民衆敎育館．民衆圖書館．以性質分、計（一）巿立、男中一處、女一處、職業學校一處、完全小學十處、初級小中學五十處、民衆館、民衆圖書館各一處、（二）半公半私、有工商子弟學校十九處、（三）私立、有中學十四處、小學六十二處、其内容大致如下、</p>
<h3>巿立學校情形</h3>
<p>巿立各校最爲複雜、（一）爲黨派問題、過去各校均有派系、校長敎員、雖不稱職、亦不易更換、否則卽釀成風潮、中經巿府决定糾正辦法、各校校長敎員、須先向巿府聲請登記、登記後由資格審查委員會審定、方能任職、但値黨營私之弊、仍未完全剷除、嗣又規定校長無完全撤換敎員權、如敎員不稱職、須請巿府查核、而繼任人選、仍須于登記合格中物色、無形中予敎員以保障、而把持之弊方可稍减、（二）爲經費問題、在省府厲行縮减以後、巿立各校經費、卽未欠發惟績欠二十一年一、二、三、七、八、九、等月經費、頗難償還、各校内部經費、已經校長、儼同官僚、每一校長、可獲數百元額外之收入、現由巿府舉辦「永備物品會計」及設「購料委員會」實行經費公開、以剔除此弊、（三）爲校舍問題、各校校舍、非借用、卽强佔、多不適宜影響甚大、巿府擬發行四十萬元庫券、供建築校舍足用、預計每一小學生收費一元、中學生收費一元五角、幼稚園學生不收、由校舍基金保管委員會保管、此項計劃、已呈由省府轉咨財部矣、</p>
<h3>私立學校情形</h3>
<p>私立學校雖有中學十四、小學六十二、百設備簡陋、經費不固定者居多、基金不充足者尤夥、巿府對敎學雖不可監督改善、而於經費問題、則無法解决、現擬於下學期、略加補助、然挖肉补瘡、未知能實現否也、</p>
<h3>工商學校情形</h3>
<p>工商子弟學校、共十九處學校由巿府辦理、經費由工商籌措、故謂爲半公半私、出捐人得合組「經費保管委員代會、」並可推舉校長、主持者、亦不免有把持或呑沒之弊、現又成立「經費監理處」制定年度預决算、整理已見成效、車業、輪渡各業子弟學校、均已擴充班次、</p>
<h3>兒童失學問題</h3>
<p>於經費困難、積弊孔多之外、更有一嚴重問題、歷久不能解决者、卽爲兒童失學問題、刻下全巿學齡兒童、數逹八萬以上、現有公私立學校、及半公半私學校、只能容納三萬人、其餘五萬餘人皆無書可讀、甚至每一學生入學、須有軍政委人薦函、否則卽不免向隅視學校如機關、雖屬滑稽、亦勢有不得已也、（二月二日）</p>

<h3>前東北敎育會長王化一</h3>
<p>談東北敎育</p>
<p>東北學院現改東北中學</p>
<p>孔祥熙張學良均允補助</p>
<p>前東北敎育會會長王化一、日前因北平東北中學經費問題、特由平來滬、謁財政部長孔祥熙、及張學良等接洽、已有良好結果、新聲社記者、昨晤王君於寓邸、據談東北敎育情形如下、</p>
<h3>學生入關</h3>
<p>據王氏云、東北自九一八淪陷以後、其時余任瀋陽敎育會會長、因另組一外交恊會、專以抗日爲主旨、是於遭日人之嫉忌甚深、九一八之次日、卽被將兩會封閉、余亦暫避至平、其後因日人對於東北敎育凡是中學以上、均被勒令停閉、不准開學、以實施其文化侵略、凡是小學、均用日人爲魂靈、故中學生遂趨關内、其初余在平先辦一東北學院、嗣改爲東北中學、呈請敎育部備案、現在中學生有一千餘人、小學生約八百餘人、</p>
<h3>實施軍事</h3>
<p>對於施敎方面、力避不急課程、將圖畫工．唱歌等課程、完全删除、加入軍事敎育、每日上操．打靶、均極認眞、除此以外、則注意化學數學工業等課、二年以來畢業生之投考升學、如在中央軍官學校投考時、取者計二十四名、其第一名卽東北中學生、餘向北平等大學投考者、無不錄取、有謀工作者、曾有數名學造紙者、亦已在北平紙廠任事、</p>
<h3>學校經費</h3>
<p>至於學校經費、其初祗向各方募衣募食、然終非久計、故張副司令（學良）未出國前、曾請求張氏楠助、張亦極爲關切、當斥私資爲學校經費襢助一次、嗣於宋部長（子文）赴熱河時、余曾晋謁請求補助辦法、宋氏卽允設法撥給、惟宋氏嗣卽出國、遂又擱置、經各方面之恊助、始於中央在華北財政機關撥欵一次、但相差尙鉅、蓋中小兩部、中學部需二萬元、小學部需八千元、宋氏返國後、承允照撥、仍以辭職未果、</p>
<h3>謁晤孔張</h3>
<p>本人此次來滬、已先後謁晤孔部長及張委員（學良）二氏、對於東北中學經費、均允設法撥助、而孔部長因對於本校情形極爲熟悉、尤爲關注、</p>
<h3>挽救人心</h3>
<p>繼謂日人現在東北、尙忙於政治軍事、故對敎育方面、尙無暇顧及、現在據東北出關者談、彼已利用漢奸、自成一編纂委員會、將關内商務．中華．世界所出書籍、全部改纂、凡有關歷史性質、一律删去、僅爲不相干者、而以日本歷史地理、逐漸加入、故預料將來必更有進一步之做法、惟余之感想、現在在東北爲日傀儡者、皆屬錦州人、其原因實緣綿州已經日數十年之薰陶、遂至認賊做父、同時日人最近之策略、認爲政治軍事、或祇壓迫一時、或祇恐嚇旦夕、故其新方針、已改以攻心爲上之計劃矣、於此我人深覺欲圖恢復國土、軍事旣遠不逮惟有盡各人力量致力於敎育、使東北同胞不忘祖先、則無論三十年或四十年之後、終有恢復之一日、否則哀莫大於心死實不勝驚懼也、</p>
<h3>中國敎育建設社</h3>
<p>積極實施生產敎育</p>
<p>與黃渡鄕師合辦養鷄塲</p>
<p>並籌備舉辦養鷄工學班</p>
<p>中國敎育建設社、爲敎育界孫亢曾膝仰支程寛正張仲寰等所組織、以倡導敎育生產化爲職志、嗣該社感於中國農村日趨破產、故於去歲與黃渡鄕村師範合辦黃渡養鷄塲、以改良農村副業、實騐生產敎育蓄有養卵鷄數百隻、一切均照科學方法管理、並聘請專家爲該塲技師、以故鷄皆壯碩可愛、現該社又籌備舉辦養鷄工學班、及試養中國鷄、以期將養鷄事業、推廣於附近農村、增進農民生產、</p>

<p>該會宣言如下、「文藝的使命、是反映時代、同時也是推動時代、但是、中國的新文藝運動、十餘年來因由於整個社會狀態的動亂、以致反映到文藝發展上的鈍滯、這已形成不可否認的事實、因此、現階段的中國文學界、仍停留在一種混亂的狀態中、－以及一切封建和反時代的文藝、依然可以苟延其生命、這是無疑需要中國新文藝運動加速地進展、方可消滅阻礙時代的封建文學的生存、而奠定中國新文藝的基礎、爲了要加速地推進我們的新文藝運動、爲了要聨合中國文藝界共同負起完成推進文藝的使命、當然迫切需要集團的力量來促成這偉大的任務、所以「中國文藝團體聨合會」就適應這客觀條件的需要而產生了、我們相信、中國許多散漫的文藝集團、固然有着不同的環境、形成不同的傾向、但是、我們需要完成中國新文藝運動、需要負起時代的使命、向着光明的大道邁進、這是完全一致的啊、所以、我們理解了我們的使命深感中國的文藝團體都有携手合作起來的必要、我們歡迎全國的文藝團體共同來參加、并且我們也希望全世界各國的文藝團體聨合會、熱烈地響應我們、以便完成這偉大的使命」、</p>

<h3>天津埠際足球隊小試脚頭</h3>
<p>－－五比一大勝輔仁大學－－</p>
<p>津隊攻守俱佳實力可怕</p>
<p>輔仁雖敗守衛表演甚好</p>
<p>（天津四日通信）北平輔仁大學足球隊自元旦來津、連著戰績、予天津巿民以極佳印象、近參加津滬埠際賽之津代表隊、行將出發、特約該隊來津表演、藉資觀摩、該隊一行十五人、業於前晚抵津備戰、昨午三時前、首至英球塲輕試脚頭、及時攝影後、列陣開賽、</p>
<h3>津隊開始猛攻</h3>
<p>津隊鎭北南攻、球入輔大陣地、卽爲李鳳樓踢還、津隊腹地連受威脅、幸第防力爭、始化險爲安、津隊乘機大舉進犯、輔仁門前、瓊士頂上失效、瞬間約翰森脚頭誤功、未幾津隊聨軍再度襲來、約翰森、愛齊爾相繼现脚、均爲輔仁門將王與民輕易傳出、瓊士邊陲又上、一脚踢來、王與民搶出急救、拍出防地、兩三回合、輔陣又入危境、</p>
<h3>輔大龍門陷落</h3>
<p>約翰森帶球前遞、芬傑瑞士亦起野心、輔仁門守接球連闖重圍、再越難關、伍幼安得球前帶繼上襲營、津麥羅斯堡不忽職守、截球前濟、芬傑瑞士再遞中鋒、愛齊爾順勢頂起險入門角、瞬間瓊士風馳而來、球遂向門滾去、門將跑出接球、不幸仆倒、球乃穩然旋入網底、紀錄始開、輔仁開球、津隊險境又臨、王精喜盤球直上、門前偏踢出線、良機再失、津隊中堅孫思敬見有隙可乘、起足長射、球向輔仁門落下、王與民急中拍成角球、上半塲同時告終、</p>
<h3>連射進四隻</h3>
<p>檸檬時間後、津陣連入險境、輔仁因軍容不整、失球頗多、津馬墨爾大顯頂上工夫、輔仁門旁再成角球、姜潞主罰、王與民跳起失手、約翰森趕上蹴入、再勝一球、五分鐘後姜潞巧截來球、約翰森追球直上、王與民搶出救、防門大開、球又入網、再戰間、津隊猛攻、愛齊兩碰門奏效、王與民負傷下塲、改由蔡彬賢遞補、唐國標接球前傳、張之偵步下又失襪會、姜潞迎球反拘、愛慶士直上以身挺入新門蔡彬賢仆救不及、遂成四比零之局勢、</p>
<h3>幸免全軍覆沒</h3>
<p>中點再開球、連言勳急遞王精熹、王盤球直上、津門四十碼脚頭又偏、球由門前溜出、瞬間津隊興師又進、愛爾知機長射、球適觸於門柱、蔡炳賢返救已晚、球竟輕馳而入、再開球劇戰未幾、王精熹邊關再動、得球後單騎急上、敵軍門前誘虎離山、球遂輕撥入洞、二十秒鐘後、血戰告終、輔仁軍幸以一比五免吃鷄蛋、</p>

<h3>津隊實力可觀</h3>
<p>昨日之戰也、平輔</p>
<p>大以一校隊、而抗津全现占西球員之精華、實力雖有所不逮、然亦可觀矣、輔仁之陣線、未見整齊、前鋒進攻、射門薄弱、且機會絶少、後防成多事之秋、三堅兩衛、殊鮮瑕疵、門前險象環生、而其能化險爲夷者、王與民之功莫大焉、復以傅牛及楊普智佐之、左輔右弼、相得益彰、以致埠際名將約翰森亦未得志、其於門前旋轉滾之球、誠屬意外、明槍好躱、暗箭難防、正此之謂也、埠際隊黑爾表演最佳、秃頭似鐵、應付裕如、後衛逹西瓦、戴拉、穩健精明、前鋒約翰森初未得志、入後幾次衝上射門、確是不凡、愛齊爾老練狡滑、傳遞挑送、均有獨到、姜璐奔馳雖速、傳遞均難實用、孫思敬昨表演欠精彩、然穩健仍屬老黃忠、總之輔仁本次病在接應無人、後防救出之球、前鋒未能響應進攻、又爲埠際截取、致乏機會叩門、倘前鋒氣力充實、復益以猛硬射擊、則情勢又當一新也、其四五兩球、正式門守受傷下塲、預備員手脚生疎、難免疏忽、况埠際約翰森愛齊爾等爲射門老將、再該校之右翼左鋒葉德祿、趙錫田均以病未能出塲、其於實力、亦不在無减尠也、</p>
<h3>上海籃球會</h3>
<p>甲組名不副實</p>
<p>昨晚三塲</p>
<p>海賊勝砲隊七三比二四</p>
<p>梵王勝猶太五九比三三</p>
<p>麥令勝大同九五比一五</p>
<p>本届上海籃球會中、甲組原有十七、分一二兩部、一部九隊、二部八隊、但一部中之江灣眞茹東華均已退出、實剩六隊、所餘十四隊中、頗多隊伍、不能名實相副、名爲甲組、實列於乙隊中、亦難奪得錦標、是以開賽以來、觀衆寥寥無幾、景况殊學蕭條、較之西青籃球、似更覺其冷落矣、</p>
<p>各隊實力、强者太强、弱者太弱、以比較言之、甲組一部中、海賊穩取首席、梵王渡雖爲海賊所敗、球藝亦有可觀、較之西青會中之約翰、其進步不可以道里計、甲二部麥令與章華、各出奇兵、並雄對峙、將於明晚决賽、爭二部優勝、奪與一部優勝之决賽權、大有可觀焉、</p>
<p>昨晚甲乙五塲比賽、甲組三塲、形勢懸殊、海賊勝砲隊、易如反掌、梵王渡勝猶太、上半時一面倒、下半時梵王渡不事多求、用二等角色應戰、形勢較爲平衡、麥令之勝大同、如玩於股掌之間、大同毫無掙扎機會、昨晚五塲結果如下、</p>

<h3>名家身手畢竟不凡</h3>
<p>史密斯第一日表演記</p>
<p>▲彈王李公頴振作有爲</p>
<p>▲今日兩塲在原處舉行</p>
<p>上海中西擊彈界所熱烈期望之世界職業擊彈名家威利史密斯、業於昨日下午六時在北京路二十七號聨華總會表演身手、日夕兩場、觀者二百餘人、欣賞之餘、莫不心領神會、嘆爲觀止、彈王李公頴在神妙莫測之勁敵周旋中、亦能挺然顯其獨立精神、前後四十槍、得六百六十點、平均每槍十六點半、較往日進步多矣、今日兩塲、第一塲下午六時、原定沈林策、沈氏以事離滬、仍請李君担任、第二塲晚九時一刻、將由我國新進好手徐世璋出塲應戰、</p>
<h3>後來居上</h3>
<p>著名職業擊彈家之觀光於上海者先後共得三人、福克尼、葛雷及此番之史密斯、上海彈王李公頴卽葛雷之入門弟子也、名師出高徒、葛雷技藝優良、可想而知、惟據曾目睹此三君之身手者所述、良覺史密斯之技能、尤高出於前者之上、是亦職業擊彈界進步之好現象也、史密斯已往事業、多刊於昨前本報、惟其中猶有一事、尙足補述者、史寗斯曾與林托猛爭奪世界職業錦標、先後交鋒五次、史密斯以二比三失利、故今日世界職業錦標、仍在林托猛掌中、</p>
<h3>全能好手</h3>
<p>史密斯自幼卽精於斯道、視爲其專門職業者、亦有二十三年之久、宜其對於六袋長方之緑呢檯上所有各種擊法、無所不能、其吸引紅彈與敵彈會合於紅彈點之左右、然後開騰、送紅、自落、循環不已、省力而又見效、爲其最拿手之本領、二人競賽卽終、個人乃作特殊表演、猶正劇後之餘興也、諸如飛彈、環走、擊香賓籃等諸技藝、新頴可觀、且指示執棒、托掌、步位諸方法、似頗有益於新進之流、</p>
<h3>競賽經過</h3>
<p>表演比賽、不重勝負、兩人各擊四十槍、史密斯得一九五○點、李公頴六百六十點、史密斯末槍三百三十三點、爲當日最大之點額、較次者、二七六．二五九．一八一．一四四．一三○．一二三．一○六．平均每槍四十八點七强、李公頴之巨數、一○○．七二．四二．四一．三○．等平均每槍十六點半、惟李氏先後空槍共七次、史密斯則有十二次之多、此則李氏鎭靜之功、較爲見長也、</p>

<p>昨日江南小洋、早巿忽跌十餘元、爲八百四十二元、午巿頓昻八元一角、爲八百五十元零一角、交易早巿五千角、午巿八千角、廣東小洋亦大勢加昻、計早巿爲七百八十六元、午巿又好一元、爲七百八十七元、結果較前日午巿加昻二元六角、做出交易早巿六萬角、午巿四萬角、銅元加長二千文、爲二百九十二千文、交易代價洋一萬元、合銅元額二萬九千四百串文、</p>
<p>證劵</p>
<h3>公債上漲力量薄</h3>
<p>各價已在高峯</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、因年關愈逼愈近、空方壁壘、漸趨搖動、掉期及了結交易稍湧、巿價卽見勁漲、此多日盤旋、似跌不跌、似漲不漲之反響、蓋多數以爲在此高度巿價放空、危險比較爲輕、但空頭雖多而多頭非常堅穩、擯持旣久、空頭又告失敗、上午開盤、補空忽起、五號及五十號頗有買進、二十及二十一號亦均有需要、七十五號空頭并有掉期、各債巿乃一致上漲甚勁、計好一二角至五六角、次盤仍有補空、裁兵猛漲五角、又見六十九元二角之新高價、其餘各種、亦大都均繼續微漲、鹽稅見五十二元之新高價、已符記者預測、午後開盤、浮多稍有出籠、回小一角至三角半、收盤大都亦小一二角、此則突漲驟跌之因果、亦爲不呆逃之循環、蓋以巿價雖尙有繼續趨漲之可能、實屬已在高峰、上漲力量　自較低價之上漲爲不易、故此時一度上漲、爲數稍鉅、必有一度之回風、但并非卽此下跌也、巿價結果、計續漲一二角至七八角不等、成交總數、計共一千五百七十六萬八千元、内現貨三千元、期貨統鹽稅共五百九十三萬、裁兵佔二百零二萬、一九關善共一百四十二萬五千、廿捲廿關共二百五十八萬、金融正六共二百二十二萬、九六亦有一百萬許、餘則數萬至二三十萬不等、</p>
<h3>紐約股巿漲勢頗强</h3>
<p>新豐洋行五日報告、紐約股巿以上週趨勢良好、債券有力、美元平定、商業消息利於多頭、包括汽車及鋼鐵出產增加、躉售及零售銷路激增、巿况異常活潑、末後多頭雖有出籠、結果仍漲數角至三元、文履脫優先股飛漲三十四元逹九十八元、道瓊斯實業股指數一度曾破一百十一大關、爲一九三一年以來之第一次、各股高峯疊出、全球皆來買進、中國亦有大宗購進、全日成交四百九十四萬股、債券尤爲大衆注意、繼續猛騰、形勢仍佳、「小麥」因股巿及棉花堅挺而有力、旱仍未斷、巿况終將趨高、「棉花」買者範圍擴大、包括國内外之定價買進、多頭了結使巿塲地位臻固、减種之私人報告依舊順利、强制辦法暫將置諸背後、商業隨貨幣新基礎而呈繁榮、除不時有反動外、價將趨高、茲將道瓊斯指數列後、</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<h3>花高紗亦漲</h3>
<p>紗巿趨堅、因原棉上升、紗巿被其激起、同時現紗銷路益覺活動、故散空稍有扒補、形勢較緊、人心亦堅、前途若何、人恃實際交易爲轉移耳、</p>
<p>（人標漲八角）人標前巿開盤、以棉巿良好、空頭活動抵補、各月漲二．三角、午後聞現紗交易較好、各月又漲四．五角、全日成交統計六千包、查賣出吉豐三百包、泰昌四百包、愼記六百包、大昶四百包、恒德二百五十包、買進椿記九百包、同和一千五百包、錦昌三百五十包、源豐三百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉巿突虑、且漲勢較熾、因印棉大漲、而匯兌未動、以致採算價每擔較上日漲一元外、於此空頭活動抵補、巿盤驟騰、但源大號逢漲儘量抛賣、而巿上現棉廠需頗滯、不過外棉尙在堅挺中云、</p>
<p>（鄭標高騰）</p>
<p>鄭標前巿開盤、隨外棉而漲、散户抵空、各月漲一．二角、午後塲中買氣尤濃、惟源大大賣出、各月又漲一角半至二角半、全日成交統計六萬三千四百擔、查賣出源大五千三百擔、恊生一千八百擔、椿記一千九百擔、吉豐二千八百擔、振大二千五百擔、新華三千二百擔、新亨三千三百擔、泰昌一千七百擔、買進賡豐四千三百擔、梅記四千四百擔、益豐六千八百擔、大豐二千擔、穗隆一千八百擔、瑞大二千擔、仁豐一千七百擔源興昌二千三百擔、永大一千四百擔、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>本巿紗布交易所、標凖改易新紗問題、雖有一度議决、以某種關係、未能實行、據昨日消息、午後所中有一聨席會議、爲最後之會議、對於標凖一事、改易與否在此一舉、詳情容探再誌、</p>
<h3>海外棉巿堅穩之局</h3>
<p>昨日美棉巿况、始因外商買進及華商街有力而漲、後以多頭了結而疲、結果現貨不動、期貨漲二磅音至五磅音、利物浦棉現貨漲二十一點、期貨漲十五六點、埃及棉現貨漲二十二點、孟買棉巿、始因投機家及散户日商買進而漲、後以一部分歐洲出口商賣出回跌、結果平加兩漲一羅比半、奥姆辣漲四羅比七角半、白羅溪漲六羅比、原電錄左、（五日電）</p>

<h3>廠家抛售遠期粉</h3>
<p>－各月跌一分半左右－</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、上午開盤後、各月份巿面、又呈疲滯之象、洋麥報價、亦上落無定、如芝加哥好一角零、坎拿大小四分八分左右、惟巿塲人心、因廠家前日續有洋麥成交、對於遠期粉、自然趁勢出擋、所以巿氣空軟、買氣甚寂、迨至下午開盤、各月份巿氣、大致盤旋、以廠家雖欲抛售、惟買户甚少、祇乏對手、照目下情形，終感購買力之薄弱、雖有大户多頭、擯住亦不易也、結果本月份較前日不動、三四月份跌一分二釐半、五月份跌一分半、六月份跌一分七釐半、七月份上午祇開五分半、計落二分半、下午未開云、</p>
<h3>河下米價平定</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源祗到二十餘號、（三千餘石）、而其中厚粳僅有三四號、餘爲晚稻、然去路零躉兩胃雖旺、終以剩貨尙夥、巿呈定局、其餘青角松泗西塘等貨、北洋帮續納二千餘包、行情悉無上落、而常帮蘇同南港等粳、店胃尙不絶、巿價亦無榮辱、惟杜洋尖以胃懈、續疲近角、變陰元供過於求、巿色修短角許、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地到船二十一二艘、巿上各色銷胃勒價拾巧動辦、巿形白粳羊杜．埠客尖價疲數分、白元陰元平定、早薄稻價疲角許、</p>
<h3>洋客秈滬存五十六萬包</h3>
<p>比上年同時增十萬包</p>
<p>洋客秈因收束停頓、存底總計逹五十六包、比去年多十萬包、但去年存底中客秈祇有四萬包、今年則多至三十五萬包矣、詳數如下、</p>

<h3>雜糧存底調查</h3>
<p>昨起雜糧除黃豆外、餘均已停巿、黃豆交易亦微、共計成交三車之譜、在此結束期中、茲錄各糧之存積列後、計車輪各豆約十萬包、大連黃豆四十車、漢口各豆二十萬包、安東豆一千六百包、浦東杜豆一千包、平湖杜豆一千包、九江遲豆六百包、九江夾青豆一千二百包、六合夾青豆一千包、牛莊黑豆三千包、平湖黑豆二千包、九江黑豆三百五十包、崇明赤豆三千包、大連菉豆五車、各種菉豆四萬包、各種缸豆二千五百包、各種芝蔴六萬二千包、各種生仁十二萬包、各種花生五千包、牛莊苞米二車、明光紅糧一千五百包、牛莊紅糧三車云、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>海外絲巿形勢良好</h3>
<p>（橫濱日絲均告激漲）横濱日絲巿面、近因歐美絲銷發動、絲價均告激漲、現絲與期絲均已漲至六百八九十餘日元、較上月中各漲三四十日元、扯合華幣漲破六百元大關、</p>
<p>（無錫廠經運滬求售）邇來滬埠洋莊絲巿、因春銷發動、歐莊分起抛購、美銷亦漸見轉機、故無錫各廠商咸將存絲積極運滬求售、連日錦記振藝等廠裝到金雙鹿．雙廌．月兎等牌白廠經一百二十包、業已上棧待售、</p>
<p>（歐美廠程績有來賬）海外生絲巿塲、因廠進轉勤、一般進口商手中存絲大半售出、存底漸薄、紐約昻里絲價均見續漲、黃白廠經海外續有來賬、惜紐約白廠經來價尙與各廠成本相差四五十元、故談判仍難就範、昨祇法莊等進白廠經四十包、黃廠經二十包、價均堅漲、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>馬足釘客銷轉動</h3>
<p>馬足釘近日客帮已有問津、本街點綴亦屬暢盛、故雖在結束期前、成交共逹三四百箱之多、價格如五號每箱開十六元五角、六號十七元、七號十七元二角半、八號十七元三角半、昨海外來價已見提加、故本埠頗有穩固之象、</p>
<h3>青鉛暫無振作之象</h3>
<p>青鉛趨勢、近仍平常、故據業中人云、廢曆年内、恐無振作之象、行情顯無機會可以進步、雖各同業爲血本關係、極覺提增、但終無術使其漲價耳、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「如此廣州」讀後感</h3>
<p>— 越客</p>
<p>前幾天，「自由談」上有一篇「如此廣州」，引據奸邊的報章，記店家做起玄壇和李逵的大像來，眼睛裏嵌上電燈，以鎭壓對面的老虎招牌，眞寫得有聲有色。自然，那目的，是在對於廣州人的迷信，加以譏刺的。</p>
<p>廣東人的迷信似乎確也很不小，走過上海五方雜處的衖堂，只要看畢剝剝在那里放鞭砲的，大門外的地上點着香燭的，十之九總是廣東人，這很可以使新黨　氣。然而廣東人的迷信却迷信得認眞，有魄力，卽如那玄壇和李逵大像，恐怕就非百來塊錢不辦。漢求明珠，吳徵大象，中原人歷來總到廣東去刮寳貝，好像到現在也還沒有被刮窮，爲了對付假老虎，也能出這許多力。要不然，好就是拚命，這却又可見那迷信之認眞。</p>
<p>其實，中國人誰沒有迷信，只是那迷信迷得沒出息了，所以别人倒不注意。譬如罷，對面有了老虎招牌，大抵的店家，是總要不舒服的。不過，倘在江浙，恐怕就不肯這樣的出死力來鬥爭，他們會只化一個銅元買一條紅紙，寫上「姜太公在此百無禁忌」或「泰山石敢當」，悄悄的貼起來，就如此的安身立命。迷信還是迷信，但迷信多少小家子相，毫無生氣，奄奄一息，他連做「自由談」的材料也不給你。</p>
<p>與其迷信，摸胡不如認眞。倘若相信鬼還要用錢，我讚成北宋人似的索性將銅錢埋到地裹去，現在那麽的燒幾個紙錠，却已經不但是騙别人，騙自己，而且簡直是騙鬼了。中國有許多事情都只剩下一個空名和假樣，就爲了不認眞的緣故。</p>
<p>廣州人的迷信，是不足爲法的，但那認眞，是可以取法，値得佩服的。</p>
<h3>孔林晚景</h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>到了紅葉紛飛的深秋，當着夕陽西下的時分，一個人踽踽地走到孔林裏去，是會發生無限的感慨的。</p>
<p>這個東方偉大的聖地，最近已經荒蕪得不成樣子了。除了門口那座標着「至聖林」三字的牌坊還巍然保持其固有風儀外，其餘的一切都隨着人事底變遷而改換了顏色。兩邊的紅牆，就像貼着許多膏藥的背板，被各色堂皇的標語塗得瘡痍滿目。道旁的古樹，已有一些倒朽在地上，失掉了那排定的行列底整齊。而在當前的廣大的頭門上，却有許多師長，司令，指揮等所下的保護令，如像衛隊一般雄糾糾地並立兩旁。這時，一顆惕服於神聖底威嚴的心，便霍然躍在這些槍尖之前顫抖了。隨着，更不由人不感到：曾爲歷代君王所頂拜的聖人聖地，現在却要任一些師長，司令，指揮等來保護，周遊列國而終不小仕的孔子，恐怕不見得會自願這樣委曲吧？</p>
<p>走到二門，則見着右邊枯立的「子貢手植楷」，只能算是一點遺骸了。同時，馬上就有一批似軍人而非軍人的大漢子奔來招待捧茶。據說，那是護林的使者，他們也是孔子底後裔，每年只能得着孔府斗把表示蓄養的俸榖，而他們底生活都全靠着來遊的遊客底賜賞，吃了他們一杯茶總得丢下一兩角錢。眞不愧是出自禮義之門，他們底殷勤的確是在别處所不容易找着的。但都不能不使人疑心到他們是在靠賣自己死了的祖宗底榮譽來過活，不知道他們可是接受了那「貧而樂，富面好禮」的遺訓。而一種凄凉的感覺，便驀地　入自己底心中了。一直走去，向左略上一層，卽到了孔子底陵墓。陵墓底背上，矗立着一棵滿枝紅葉的又像是又像不是的槐樹，周圍却被那參天的古柏古檜合抱着。右邊是子實守喪的陵廬，左邊稍遠一點是乾隆等駐過的蹕亭，再下就是伯魚和子思底陵墓，儼然像一個羣臣所拱的朝廷。這時又不禁引起一種莊嚴的感覺來。信步前去，疎疎的陵園，淺淺的草地，到是一個旣可以仰天長嘯，又可以徘徊低吟的境地，卽使不必順着次序去一一加以拜訪亦會發生一種悠悠之思，使人感到像「逝者如斯乎」那樣不可名狀的情調。返身出來，立在洙水橋上一望，這又是别的一種天地橫在自己底目前了。兩岸的蘆葦，翩翩地翻成白浪，它不能不令人發生一種飄飄出世的感覺。順流而下，更得見無涯的白浪中滾着紅潮，尤不能不令人想到「落花流水溶溶」的名句，那才是正在蘆葦中飄蕩着的矮小的紅樹。如果再折而登上牆樓，遠遠地望去，那便像一簇麥稈上結着無數的春繭，馬上又會使人發生對於家鄕的無限的相思。抬頭看看天邊的浮雲，而那團含在山峽中的渾醉的夕陽却早已不知去向了。一顆剩下的心只得寂莫地去尋那穿過荒烟漫野的歸程。</p>
<p>我想，有些人底晚景，大約亦會像這樣，但又有幾人能得着這樣燦爛的晚景呢！</p>
<h3>讀古書的商榷</h3>
<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>「我應該讀些什麽古書？」有許多朋友常這樣問我。大約因爲他們知道我小時曾有多時的書房生活，所以把我認爲「識途老馬」了。其實，我雖讀過幾年古書，並不是一個什麽「國粹學者」，我的意見當然也不値「權威者」的一笑。不過就我自己讀古書的經騐約略討論一下，也許可以供「想讀古書的朋友」的參考。　　我覺得讀古書並不是使新文藝技巧進步的必要條件。有許多人以爲若沒有古書的根底，便寫不出好的新文藝，其實，這種見解並沒有科學的根據。果然，新文藝家中像魯迅，胡適，都曾讀過古書，但這不能證明讀古書是新文藝技巧上的必要條件。譬如：司馬遷曾遊過名山大川，所以就有人硬說史記文章的好處是從名山大川得來的。但遊過名山大川的文人當然不止司馬遷一個，何以别人就寫不出史記的文章來呢？從另一方面觀察，漢高祖是流氓出身，並沒有讀過許多當時的古書，因爲都被秦始皇燒了，但他的大風歌却一向算爲千古的绝唱。再說，現在新文藝作家中有許多都不曾讀過古書，但並不見得就寫不好新文藝。</p>
<p>在實際上，古書對於新文藝的技巧－體裁，造句，用字，等等－不能有什麽重要的帮助。先秦的文藝不必說，只看以前認爲必修科的昭明文選，其中對於新文藝有實用的作品就很少。譬如「兩京賦」，「三都賦」都是公認爲偉大的。但試問這種問答式的文體，獺祭式的典故，砌假山式的辭藻，對聨式的造句，對於我們有什麽用處？有人說，至少讀了可以增加字彚。不錯，奇字僻典固然是不少，不過讀時旣要看了「李善註」纔懂，寫時那裏會自然地奔凑到筆尖上來？就算奔凑來了，那麽等到文章寫完之後，必須找個李警來註一下，然後讀者纔看得懂。這未免太麻煩了，而且這個年頭，到那裏去找李善去？</p>
<p>唐宋以來的作品比較略近我們的時代，但和白話還差得太遠，所以對於新文藝的技巧也不能有什麽大貢獻。這並不是因爲以前沒有好的文藝作品可以供我們取材，實在因爲文言和白話之間的隔膜，又深又厚，所以融通的可能性也就很小了。</p>
<p>除非想做什麽「整理國故」的工作，我們對於古書實在沒有讀的必要。若爲文藝的修養，可以隨意揀選幾種古來的代表作，在空閒時候翻翻，就很足够了。若能多看幾種，當然也好，但對於新文藝寫作的技巧上却不一定有什麽益處。此外，文學史和歷史，我以爲倒應該看幾本，可以約略知道一些歷來文學的嬗變，作家的時代，和時代的歷史背景。可惜中國出版界到現在還是處處落後。譬如歷代的代表作就沒有適應時代需要的精善的選本，也沒有一本完善的唯物史觀的本國通史。否則學者就可以省去許多時間和精力了。</p>
<p>爲文藝的修養而讀些古書，我並不反對，因爲這是我們的遺產，我們當然可以自由地享受。不過文藝的遺產，像家庭的遺產一樣，也有毒的成分。承繼遺產的人最容易變成「不事生產」的守產者。子孫出得不肖，就一代不如一代，結果只剩下一個「破落大户」。讀古書的流弊往往使讀者把古代的作品奉爲典型，養成模仿的心理，失去了創造的勇氣。只顧把陳典腐詞搬來用，在作品裏裝滿了死人話，漸漸地和活文藝愈離愈遠，終至跟着古人走進了時代的墳墓。</p>
<p>總之，讀古書並不能使新文藝的技巧有如何的進步，這至少是我個人的經騐。新文藝的技巧必須在活人的話裏創造出來，纔有生命，纔有虎虎的力量。這是古書所不能給我們的。</p>
<h3>說謊的丈夫</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>這一天，年青丈夫的心頭忐忑着，像落了魂似的，雖然走到了自己門前，也忘記了舉起手來叩門。</p>
<p>在他腦裏始終晃動着方纔在經理室裏的一幕景象：滿面紅光的經理，正架起了腿，很舒適的在電爐邊烤火，用一個虚僞的笑容迎接他進來，先和他做了一番應酬式的談話，從幾年來的仰仗說起，一直說到最近普遍世界的不景氣，然後言歸正傳，說近來店裏的生意也受了這不景氣的影響，閙到非裁員不能維持的地步，因了這一個事實，不得不請他另謀高就，接着又說了許多抱歉的話，纔把他送出門來，那時，他耳邊依稀聽得「噹啷－」一響，幾年來靠着生活的一隻飯碗，開始被打碎了。</p>
<p>也就從那個時候起，他開始了他的忐忑。這忐忑，把他從店裏送到他自己門前，一直沒有停過。</p>
<p>站在自己的門前，一個大的苦惱緊緊抓住了年青丈夫的心，使他完全喪失了所有的勇氣。他不知道以後將怎樣維持生活，怎樣維持這可愛的幸福的家庭，而且在目前就有着一個大難關，他不知道他將怎樣對他的愛妻措詞。</p>
<p>連一些思考的時間都沒有，門就在他這苦惱中「閕」的一聲開了，年青的妻從門裏探出頭來。她似乎想出來眺望街頭的風景，不料迎面就瞧見了她幽靈似的丈夫，她不禁驚奇得呌出聲來了。</p>
<p>「怎麽，你一聲不響的站在這里」？</p>
<p>年青丈夫不得不勉强打疊起精神來，他裝着笑，搖了搖頭，表示他沒有什麽，很快的携着他愛妻的手走進屋裏去。他竭力强制着，不讓自己有一絲不快的神情漏進她眼裏，他照常和她談笑，做夢也似的對她說了許多未來的希望和打算，並且爲要顯出他是正在快樂中，他更開起留聲機來，讓宏亮的聲音在屋裏四處亂撞。</p>
<p>但他的心却仍舊深深的被苦惱包圍着，瞧着屋裏歡樂而又幸福的空氣，想到這不久便將歸於沒落，而且將帶走他和他愛妻兩人的生活，他立刻覺得他所坐的沙發上都佈滿了鋼針似的，刺着他作痛。</p>
<p>便是夜裏躺到了牀上，年青丈夫的心也不曾得到寗貼，他只是在牀上苦惱地翻着身。一直到他的妻詫異地問他爲什麽還不睡，他纔接連乾笑了幾聲說：</p>
<p>「親愛的，沒有什麽，我馬上就睡了。」</p>
<p>第二天一清早，年青丈夫就從牀上爬起身來。一夜的不眠使他眼裏都密佈着紅絲了。但他還不免要裝出有職務在身非常忙碌的樣子。他照常吻着他的妻，和她作别，照常輕輕地帶上了房門。</p>
<p>獨自走到了路上，一個問題橫梗在年青丈夫的心頭：到什麽地方去消磨這長長的時間呢？他想了許多的地方，最後是覺得還不如到圖書館裏去看書。於是，他便向着圖書館走去了。</p>
<p>坐在冷靜的圖書館裏，一本書攤放在他面前，但他却沒有心緒看下去。在他眼前不住跳躍着一些黑的字：「失業」「落魄」「告貸」「死亡」，而一天的光陰也就很快的消磨過去了。（未完）</p>
<h3>奶媽（五）</h3>
<p>— 徐轉蓬</p>
<p>女客們喝了酒，個個都興奮起來，不說話的姑母也變成個愛說話的人了，她讚美孩子，又稱讚養孩子的奶媽。她在太太面前說：</p>
<p>「你家的奶媽眞年輕呵，只有二十歲上下，要比你年輕十年吧？」</p>
<p>「年輕嗎？哈哈，孩子的父親挑選來的，他說年輕人奶乳多，所以他選中了她……」</p>
<p>太太說出這幾句話，是勉强而費力的，心裏忡忡有些不安。在年輕的奶媽面前，太太是感覺得自己年紀大了。女人倔是慣愛拿這樣東西和那樣東西比較，愛把自己和别人去比較的。</p>
<p>散席後，來客們互相閒談，忽又牽連到奶媽身上去了。</p>
<p>「你前些日子告訴我，奶媽很骯髒，穿着破衣服，今天看見她，可是穿得清清楚楚的，年紀輕，人品也過得去……」小姨母問太太。</p>
<p>「她現在打扮起來了。」太太說。</p>
<p>「呵，她也知道打扮了……」</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>後三天的早晨，太太突然吩咐奶媽說：</p>
<p>「你回去吧，我已另外雇了人。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呌我走？你不是呌我養大孩子再回家嗎？我有什麽錯處？太太。」</p>
<p>太太始終沒有將理由說出來。</p>
<p>女廚子也奇怪了，她對太太的脾氣，簡直不明白：「太太到底要挑選怎樣一個奶媽才中意呢？前個奶媽比太太自己好看一倍，一禮拜就辭掉了……這個比太太年輕十歲，只是一個月又辭掉……奶媽年紀輕，奶多，孩子又喂得胖胖的……」（完）</p>

<h3>再談「苪禍」</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>世界的戰爭風聲，一天一天地緊急，由於遠東事態之惡化，歐美方面時時發出戒備的警鐘，喊着國民一致啦，復興啦，繁榮啦，軍備啦，等等富有誘惑力和麻醉性的術語，去鼓動，去號召那些飢餓之羣，忍着苦爲國家民族爭榮譽。那些鼓動者，號召者，是何等聲勢嚇嚇地，戰鼓　　地，旗幟顯明地揚威耀武呵！</p>
<p>世界正在昏天暗地之下，摸索着前路，人類正在血肉糢糊之中喑鳴着悲慘世人所目爲怪傑的墨索里尼又妙想天開地喊着黃禍論，他說「白種人文明之遠東制霸與太平洋之命運，繁於中國今後百年間發展之如何．吾人想像將來中日兩國之融合，並非不可能，但其兩國之一致．誰能保障非反歐美者也」。鳴呼，此眞怪傑之言也！</p>
<p>高唱黃禍論，當爲别有用意，日本人之橫蠻暴亂，也是觸發黃禍論者的心靈的一個事實，我們不必看在黃臉皮上便說些掩蓋是本人的橫蠻暴亂的話。然而「黃禍」云乎哉，果眞會戰爲白人之禍嗎？這我們應該說幾句乾脆的話。</p>
<p>在歐美，在東洋－我們的敵國，那些保守主義者們，都猜想着世界的最近，白色人種和黃色人種會有像原始的鬥爭時代之一日到來。他們這樣猜想，也就這樣宣傳，這樣凖備。白色人種和黃色人種會有如原始的鬥爭時代之一日麽，這要從世界經濟的意義上來看，便可一目了然。</p>
<p>今日世界的經濟，那無可諱言，已到了最後瓦解的階段。飢餓之號聲流離</p>
<p>之慘呌，洋溢於世界之每一個角落在這些並非黃與白之爭，是同色同種的爭而同種同色的人心猶不足，還要挾其經濟的政治的軍事的暴力，從事征服别種族－弱小民族之類，這纔有所謂種族之爭，弱者反抗强者的事實，亦由是而生。</p>
<p>今日的國際戰爭在爆發。由國際經濟關係而惹起的世界的變動，正如在暴風雨之前夜一般，戰爭是有一觸卽發之勢，然而，這不是人種的戰爭，這是帝國主義國家間或與社會主義國家或與弱小國家的惡鬥。</p>
<h3>臘梅和天竹</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>吃過午飯，一個人跑到城隍廟。廟裏永遠擁湧着那末許多的人，我肩挨着肩走完九曲橋，似乎覺得一個人到城隍廟來是太無聊了。我不想發財，也不想長壽，自己對自己沒有把握，何必去求所謂「老爺」之類的木偶，就生氣地向外走去。在小世界門前插着許多臘梅天竹，倒似乎使我感到興趣。我寫字臺上有個朋友從遠地送給我的花瓶，可是在都巿中買不起高貴的洋花，借牠來做了筆筒，眞太對不起我朋友千里送鵝毛的盛意了；所以我曾寫了封信去告訴他花瓶的附作用，他的回信倒也無所謂，說你把牠放在寫了臺上，已是牠意外的榮幸，插花，插筆都是一般看得起牠。然而想想倒底花瓶内插花是自然的，和筆筒内插筆一樣。今天無意中發見了我所愛好的臘梅和天竹，就想起插在我朋友遠道送來的花瓶，一定十分古色古香；甚而致於我想買一個小的香壚，每天我讀書寫字的時候，燃上三枝芸香，是頂有趣味的事。想着我就站定了脚。做賣買的人當然知道主顧的心理，他見我呆呆地瞧着，就從柴插上𢬌下兩枝臘梅和天�</p>
<p>竹，像一個藝術家賞鑒自己的作品一樣，他瞧着小眼睛對我說：「先生，這兩枝！」說着，把手擎高一點，似乎告訴我遠遠瞇去更是了不得的有樣。在平時，我見了這般態度，無論到米舖裏去　米預備今天晚上燒夜飯的，我也寗願緊了緊褲子帶回來。但是一個人不能有嗜好，我生下地來就愛花，和賈寳玉生下地來愛胭脂花粉一樣。當時就是那瞇着小眼睛的人再裝出怪惹人的態度，我也不致於十分討厭，他手中的臘梅和天竹倒底是可愛的；我果然也側了頭，作爲賞鑒的模樣，「賣多少錢」？這樣說了。</p>
<p>「先生是老主顧」，他拉開了大嘴，笑起來了，眼睛顯得更小，幾乎只見面兩堆的花，「算一塊四毛錢罷」。挺出肚子，把兩枝臘梅和天竹送到我面前，那一個手掌向着天，彷彿在馬路上乞錢的乞丐。可是我的手掌却伸不出來，我不是老主顧；要是老主顧，我决不大膽地部「賣多少錢？」我自己知道在我新做的錦地縐的皮袍中僅有三枚雙毫。一個老主顧他自然知道兩枝臘梅和天竹要賣一元四毛錢，我還敢問嗎？</p>
<p>望着花不能到手，我似乎只瞧見那討厭的態度了。快些走罷，花瓶内插筆倒底不是犯罪的事；然而那張粗大的手把我拉住了，「先生，你說罷。」我自然不能告訴他我袋裏只有六毛錢，這對於這襲新袍子不是侮辱嗎！</p>
<p>「太貴！」我搖着頭，這兩個字的意思表示並不是買不起，不過是價鈿高出於貨物而已。</p>
<p>「先生買慣的，你說啊。」四周的人慢慢圍攏來，我想他們都是老主顧吧，像我這樣無聊的人將整個下午來逛城隍廟不致於的；旣是在老主顧面前，我被那瞇着小眼睛人你說啊，你說啊的而沒有回答，不會笑掉人家－毌寗說老主顧們的下巴嗎。</p>
<p>「六毛錢。」滿不在乎的說了，我自信大少爺的架子做得十足的，雖然全部的家財已在這一句話裏宣告破產了。</p>
<p>「先生：：」小眼睛的人儘是笑，我以爲這是可以走的機會了，很瀟洒的推開了面前的兩個人，緩緩地開步走了，心裏當然想逃得快一點，但至少這時候應該做足架子，在第二柴插旁看了一眼。當那第二個的主人－白髮斑斑的老頭子笑着立起來的時候，大聲的「先生」把我喊回去，那小眼睛的人，把臘梅和天竹塞到我手裏，「先生，隨你給罷。」我一手接了，一手在衣袋裏掏了半嚮，好像從許多的一堆中掏出六毛錢來。小眼睛的人接了錢，還出乎我意料外的開口了「先生，新年發財，隨便加幾個錢罷」。天啊！如其我沒有穿這襲錦地縐的新皮袍，我一定摔了花搶回六毛錢來。我因爲愛花犧牲了全部財產的十分之十。「新年」，和我什麽相干，更與臘梅天竹什麽相干？不好意思說沒有另外一枚銅元了，像大少爺駡底下一樣：「賣便賣，不賣拉倒！」人倒底是最下賤的動物，他不發一聲地把錢藏好了去接第二頭生意。</p>
<p>回家來把花瓶内的筆盡行𢬌出，加了水，插上臘梅天竹，怪滿意地笑了；然而不敢再夢想買什麽香爐之類，沒有錢當然是大原因，還恐怕妻瞧見了防我做和尙去哩，於是將一切經過情形寫信去告訴送我花瓶的朋友，不知他又將回我些什麽話。</p>
<h3>賣橄欖聲</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>在理論上說，夏歷應該早在廢止之列了，在事實上，民間多仍是沿着習慣在採用夏歷。所以，我們的理智固明知現在已是二月時候，然而感情上總還不免存着歲暮之感，因爲四面的環境儘論滿着「歲暮」的色彩，我們要忘記他似乎</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>也是不可能的。</p>
<p>歲暮的景象，最使我感觸到的，當沒有再比夜半賣橄欖的呌聲來得深切的了。每年到了這時候，街頭上便發現了橄欖的呌賣聲，它具着時計鐘一樣的作用，它告訴我們季候又到了寒冷的時節，一年又怱怱地過去了。</p>
<p>「橄－欖」賣，檀－香－橄欖呵，賣－橄欖！」</p>
<p>這聲音是那麽的哀惋而凄切，常打動我的心弦。尤其是當夜深了的時候，我從外面回家來，在漆黑的里巷中忽然望見一個挈着一盞幽黯的煤油燈的賣橄欖者，我總是要把脚步放慢下來，傾聽這動人的呌聲；或是當我在燈下讀書的時候，遠遠地傳過這賣橄欖的呌聲，我常是閉起眼睛聽着，聽着，往往在不知不覺中使我流起涙來了。</p>
<p>它常使我引起一種　渺的不可思議的情緒，似乎是憐憫的，似乎是傷感的，又像是同情的；總之，它充滿着和善親愛的成分。它會有着偉大的感人的力量，我想卽使那醉迷在粉紅色夢中的狂歡的人們．聽了這聲音．也未有不爲之瞿然而驚的吧？聽啊，那麽凄切地：</p>
<p>「橄欖賣，檀香－橄欖呵，覿賣－橄欖！」</p>
<p>自從我有感覺以來，我不曾聽到比這更動人的歌曲，賣橄欖者眞是一個偉大的音樂家我願在此爲他祝福！</p>
<h3>幸福的重壓</h3>
<p>— 路子</p>
<p>「人是不能過於幸福的；過於幸福了，幸福會壓毁生命的」。當我正安逸地生活在幸福裏的時候，聽到這樣的話。</p>
<p>我不學啞然的笑了。譏嘲從心裏一直爬到臉上。</p>
<p>「世豐眞有被幸福壓毁的人嗎？如有，那我應早已壓毁了」。</p>
<p>「你不是已壓毁了麽？唉，唉」！似乎很惋惜的在我耳邊響起了。</p>
<p>「怎麽？我已壓毁了」！我驚訝的反問着。</p>
<p>「是的」！很堅决地來了這麽一個回聲。</p>
<p>我開始思索，我覺得我還是我－－十分快樂的我。並且還有許許多多的人們在欣羨我呢？眞的，我底環境很好。在我身上滿是輕快而自由，那有絲毫累贅的重壓呢？更沒有什麽壓毁了！這眞是造謠，我不禁憤然了。</p>
<p>「什麽重壓呀？你這欺騙者」！</p>
<p>「我不會欺騙你，欺騙你的，恐怕倒還是你自己底無知吧？你自一生下來的時候，幸福卽落在你底身上，而你底生命便哭了。以後幸福的壓力日重，而你底生命也日毁。然而你再也不會哭了，你已與重壓習慣，你已忘記你底生命了。世間最可憐的是生命已毁而自己還不知道的人，你便是其中的一個」。</p>
<p>「哦，我是個可憐的不知生命已毁的人麽？那末，究竟什麽東西這樣壓着我呢」！</p>
<p>「那是幸福，是你幸福的源泉－－遺產」。</p>
<p>「遺產嗎，於我是很好，它只給我舒逸，它不給我勞作，怎麽會壓着我呢」？</p>
<p>「你以爲很好麽？這就是你壓毁的原因了。它給你底幸福固然很多，斵傷你底生命也就太甚。於你歡歌正濃的時候而喪歌奏起了。現在你空具生命的虚形，你已沒有生命的實質了」。</p>
<p>「不，我還是和人一樣」！</p>
<p>「一樣！你以爲四肢五官嗎？那麽，你底手呢？你底手有用麽？能創造什麽呢？你底脚呢？能履坦途麽？另闢新路麽？你底腦也能思想麽？能想到很遠的地方麽？你底眼也能看麽？能眞有所見的看麽？然而你，你全身不過是整個的無用大結合。這能説是和人一樣嗎？你這生命的壓毁者」。</p>
<p>「沒用，這又有什麽關係呢？，只要我有形體便够了，只要我很幸福便够了」。</p>
<p>「然而你沒有生命」。</p>
<p>「我不是感着我底存在嗎」？</p>
<p>「生命的存在，不以虚形，而以實質。一個生命，要有一個生命的力；如火之有光有熱。如其毫無作用，不過是一具行屍罷了。</p>
<p>我僅聽到這裏，底下便聽不見了。我發現找倒在地下，全稱癱痪；另外發現許多沉重的東西，壓在我底身上。我已輾轉不能，惟有痛苦的呻吟了。</p>
<p>是誰和我這樣説呢？我將永久地茫然了。</p>
<h3>「理想」與「現實」</h3>
<p>— 笠笠</p>
<p>「理想是美麗的，現實是醜惡的」！這是青年們爲現實擊破了美麗的憧　後覺悟（？）的呐喊，這個在讀了文炳君的「理想生活的自白」後進一步的證實了。本來，在未踏入社會如旭日初升的青年們，有的是赤紅的心，沸熱的血，奮發的精神，前進的思想。對于社會，製造着美麗的空中樓閣，同時抱着改革社會的雄心；這一個長滿鋭利的稜角的車輪，滾上了崎嶇的社會之道後，嫩脆的鋭角，能經幾次磨折？於是斷了折了，慢慢的圓了滑了，與世同化了。經騐豐富，處世圓滑，「做人」的條件已完備，在社會立足的基礎才鞏固了。</p>
<p>在鋭利的稜角初次受創時，青年們美麗的空中樓閣，給「現實」的斧斫到了，改革社會的雄心，給「現實」的劍刺傷了，於是苦悶之鍊銷住了青年們的心，熱情無處寄托，熱血無處洒瀟的時候，一方面咀咒「現實」，一方面追求「理想」，以美麗的「理想」和醜惡的「現實」相比，如嫫母與西子競美，媸妍立斷！</p>
<p>文炳君在「理想生活的自白」中所説的：「：：：决計像那些昔賢似的過眘隐士生活：：：」「：：：讓明月爲我作伴，讓清泉爲我照心：：：」「：：：至於世界，我願抛棄給那輩勢利之徒，讓他們在會訪中以炸彈手槍相見吧！讓他們朋友陷害朋友，親人陷害親人：：：」這個，把一切憤世妒俗的青年們心中要説的話都説出來了，雖然不一定是這個理想，至少動機是一致的，所不同的方法而已！</p>
<p>我不否認文炳君的話，且對于文炳君抱着十二分的同情，可是，在現在這黑白顚倒的沌混世界，豈是把一切都丢了，做個桃花源中人，保持着「身之察察」和「獨善其身」所可改革的呢？恐怕給一輩勢利之徒炸彈手槍相見閙得更黑暗，更顚倒更混沌了。</p>
<p>廚川白村在苦悶的象徵中説得好：「鐵和石相擊，迸出火花來，奔流和岩石相衝飛出泡沫，生出紅霓來，同樣，兩種的力相衝突，展出華麗的人生的萬華鏡，卽生活底種種色相來」。「我們底生活，我們的存在，早已根本失其意義了。因爲有生的苦悶，有戰的苦悶，所以人有生的價値。」屈原若安安穩穩的做着官，離騷是無從產生的。司馬遷若不受宮刑下獄，史記怎會成就的。紈袴子弟的庸庸碌碌，而偉人的成功，必經千辛萬苦，這都是力的相衝突的結果。那末青年們的所遇輒左，却是極好的試金石，又何必咀咒，痛恨，苦悶着呢？</p>
<p>青年們！别躺在「理想」的懷中，把「現實」忽略了，忘懷了，要把美麗的「理想」成爲「現實」，把醜惡的「現實」改成美麗的「理想」才是。要知道不根據「理想」的「現實」是醜惡的而良好「的現實」都是根據「理想」的，科學家的成功，都是以理想做基礎的。「理想」是「現實」之始，「現實」是「理想」之終，如始終之一的做去，事之不成者，未之有也。</p>

<p>穿了那法蘭絨，馬褲呢的腿，慢慢的拖着，拖着，發出那笨重的皮鞋聲，向着那陰暗的課室移去。</p>
<p>疲乏的身體，笨重地倒在椅子裹，輕輕地嘘着氣，課室内呈出那一片灰暗悽愴的陰暗。</p>
<p>帶了黑皮包的瘦長子，王先生，輕快地跳上講台，高聲地點着名，回答的是疲乏似的，輕微的「到」字。</p>
<p>高朗嚮亮的王先生的寗波音，在空氣中打着轉，飛不進每一個人的耳朶，像是下了戒嚴令似的。每一隻灰暗的臉上顯出耐不住的情緒，身體怪不適意的在椅子上搖着，把那破舊了的椅子發出一陣「吱吱格格」的聲音。於是，課室在慢慢的騷動。</p>
<p>一個明晰的美俏的倩影，在小李的眼前晃去，於是一幕幕的有趣味的回憶，在他面前展演開來。</p>
<p>星期日那天，大光明的一刻，眞不差呀－滑腻的手，豐盛的胸部，輕輕的俏語，還有那二片朱唇，要不是影院電燈亮了的話，那麽，再進一步才眞够味哩！唉，眞可惜，又要等一個星期，坐牢似的一個星期的生活，唉，我眞笨，……</p>
<p>「啪」的一聲，拳頭打在桌子上。</p>
<p>人們嚇了一下，驚奇的回轉頭來望着他，過後便是一陣笑聲，他慚愧地縮進那隻手，還覺到有些麻辣辣般的痛，低下了頭，紅着臉不作聲。</p>
<p>突然，肩上有人拍着，他尶𡯓的扭過頭去，見是野和尙，手裏拿着一張紙，塞在他的手裏，還那麽樣的鬼臉向他做一下。看那紙時，只見上面寫着：</p>
<p>「日想小蓮，夜做夢，</p>
<p>想得你來，涙汪汪，</p>
<p>想得恨時，心發火，</p>
<p>啪的一聲，驚課堂。」</p>
<p>接後是滿敎室的怪笑聲，遮斷了寗波先生的敎書音。這時，太陽已從窗槅中照到每人的臉上。馬路上也傳來了幾聲「啵啵」的汽車聲。</p>
<p>人們慢慢的生動起來了，打破靜了寂的空氣，談着，談着那大光明的片子，中央回力球塲和大滬跳舞塲的一切。</p>
<p>突然，鐘聲明響地，打進了每一個人的心絃，振作了一下，飛奔出去，拿了籃球到操塲上玩着，一切都忘了，滿面都是顯出秋天裏的春光。</p>
<p>瘦長子，王先生，懊喪地，拿了皮包，慢慢的踱出了課堂。</p>

<h3>夫被綁票可否離婚</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>近日敝人，有一事，百思莫索。日坐愁城之中；今不以瑣屑，敢乞援於先生，希不吝敎之。</p>
<p>民國廿一年一月間，爲舍妹出閣之期，對方乃一中農之家，略有資產，且妹丈更係獨生子，故結婚之後，甚爲和諧。不料未及三月，忽爲匪徒垂涎，而遭綁架。聞曾數度與綁匪接洽，奈因票價不合，致迄今尙無着落，然外傳已撕票矣。舍妹寡守，行將二年；年華易老，青春易逝，能不令彼心碎耶？敝人以情切骨肉，恒思一爲執言；因對方係鄕愚，恐其蠻不講理，且敝人又不諳法律，故遲遲至今，未爲説項耳。</p>
<p>茲以疑問四則列後：</p>
<p>（一）可否要求脱離？（二）如可脱離，可以嫁妝帶回否？（三）對方後嗣無人，可要求赡養否？（四）求得赡養，可重嫁乎？</p>
<p>懇一一賜知，不勝盼禧，此視</p>
<p>著安　　　　　　　　施正謹上　　二．五．</p>
<p>再者，此信純係舍妹之意，並非敝人强爲執言。</p>
<p>編者按：來函所詢四點：茲條覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）如夫死確可證實，重嫁自可不生問題，但照來函所説：「迄今尙無着落，外傳已撕票矣」，則令妹夫在想像上固可推定確已不在人世，然究竟死亡與否，仍無確證。因此不能以「推定死亡」之故而改嫁也。然此種狀態若長此繼續。殊與令妹不利，故現行民法離婚法定原因内，又規定「生死不明已逾三年者」可呈訴離婚。而令妹如需離婚，似需再經過一年之時間也。</p>
<p>（二）「離婚之婦，無論由何原因，其嫁奩旣爲專供其個人使用之物，卽屬其特有財產，當然聽其携去。」（見上字第二三三號離婚涉訟判决要旨）故此點不生問題。</p>
<p>（三）（四）要求赡養之規定見現行民法第一零五六及一零五七條，前者爲請求損害賠償，日後者則爲請求赡養費。足下可自己查聞條文。惟查赡養費之規定，純係恐對方生活陷於困難而設，重嫁後，扶養已屬有人，則赡養費似無理由請求也，但請求赡養費對於重嫁並無限制，故求得赡養，亦可重嫁也。</p>

<h3>孤獨的人（八）</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>效蓀同時也站起身來，向靜文的母親點了點頭，他們兩個走出新房。</p>
<p>男女賓客四面圍住來，留着中間甬道闊狹的地位，無數對的眼珠都向外邊走來的克佳靜宜望着。勤菠已站在新娘的身旁，靜文忙把效蓀推出去，於是一對「失戀」的主角包住了一對「把戲」的主角。</p>
<p>自然，在許多男女來賓之間，他們明瞭在衆目所屬的四個人的過去的，各種取笑的，推測的話都從肉屏中飛來送進四個人每個人的聽覺。</p>
<p>靜宜微笑着喂在野牛的身旁，克佳扮足了正經面孔，勤菠那樣滿不在乎的表示自己是一個做個新娘的老手，效蓀低着頭，天然鬆由的頭髮在頭頂跳舞。在歡笑，快樂的頌詞聲中，完成了一齣偉大的「把戲。」</p>
<p>彩色的紙條，紙屑，在每個人的面前飛舞，擠着，擁着，一對新人向新房裹去的時候，效蓀烟一般的溜了出來，他踏着剛才靜宜和克佳從汽車上進來的甬道向門外去。他感到自己是個孤獨的人，被世界所遺棄了的。他後悔到上海來，杭州有幽靜的古寺，有深邃的山峯，可以泛舟的西湖，可以養性的小樓，一切適宜於一個孤獨的人，他甚至懷恨克佳故意在自己面前賣弄他和靜宜的結合。他寗願承認不及一個女人的氣量，他是女人手下的弱者。你着頭向門外走來搖動他天然鬆曲的頭髮，忽然後面有女人的聲音喊着自己的名字，他以爲是靜文，沒有理會，自顧向外走。然而趕到他並肩來的是他不願意見的勤菠。</p>
<p>「那裹去？」拍着他的肩頭，像一個情人一樣。</p>
<p>效蓀神經質地笑了「買捲烟。」滿不在乎的回答。</p>
<p>「我有。」她從手提袋中拿出一個精巧烟盒，授一枝烟給效蓀，並打着火凑到效蓀的唇邊。</p>
<p>「多謝你。我想到南京路走走。」他見勤菠挽了他的手臂要他進去的樣子，這樣説了。</p>
<p>「好，我們一同走走。」始終是出於效蓀意料之外底的女的態度。</p>
<p>三月的春風吹動了每顆青年男女心，吹動了大减價的旗幟，吹動了朱效蓀天然鬆曲的頭髮，他們倆挽着手像一對情人一樣，沒有説話，踏着那樣短小的脚步，沿着跑馬廳，到南京路。勤菠以爲效蓀買什麽物件東西，走了一陣路，還是那般低着頭，自然，一個聰明女子她懂得一切，她把效蓀手彎里的手臂努力推了他一下，一種極誠懇的態度説：</p>
<p>「效蓀，還生我的氣嗎？」眼珠像縮小了，鎖緊了眉心。</p>
<p>「勤菠，還提這類話嗎？」神經質地笑了起來，搖動着天然鬆曲的頭髮。</p>
<p>「你應該原諒我，李少節不是個人！」她的高跟鞋重重地打着水門汀。</p>
<p>讀者，我將告訴一件地球是圓的驚人證據，效蓀和勤菠一直向前走的，卻到了飯店的門前；到於他們曾否轉過灣，我是沒有注意。</p>
<p>然而飯店門前有一個人注意了－是靜文。臨時新房中一陣騷亂之後，他們發現不見了一對男女嬪相。有了那天然鬆曲頭髮的記號。一個侍者告訴他們是和一位女客朝外走的。靜文趕到門前來，正望見了他們倆，可是在他們自己卻沒有知道已環行，「地球」一週。</p>
<p>「小弟弟：」她笑着喊了起來。</p>
<p>當然，一個聰明男子也懂得一切的，效蓀摔了勤菠的手臂跑前了幾步。</p>
<p>「三個月不見上海」，什麽都變了！一搖動着天然鬆曲的頭髮。</p>

<h3>逹利歐氏預言　好萊塢今年的動向（上）</h3>
<p>— 炳賤</p>
<p>嘉寳將永遠脱離影壇</p>
<p>范朋克將重返好萊塢</p>
<p>關於世界大事的預言，今年我们已經見了很多，可是關於電颢界的預言，似平還不多見。</p>
<p>美國電影應誌"Modern　Screen"本年二月份上登載了一篇關於好萊塢的預言。預言者是在好萊塢馳名的逹利歐氏（Dareos）。逹氏在去年年初亦曾作過同樣的預言，他預言了六十八件事。在這六十八件事之中的有四十八件，卽百分之七十；猜错的有八件，卽百分之十一，無結果的是十二件，佔百分之十七。他的預言雖然不見得是百分之百的凖確，然而這百分之七十的預中也頗有可觀了。茲擇譯其中比較重要的，錄之於下：</p>
<p>我們先説去年最紅的梅蕙絲。逹氏預言梅蕙絲一九三四年仍舊度着獨身生活。雖然這一年她信舊地浪漫下去，可是她終於會保持梅蕙絲小姐的尊稱的。在影壇上的地位，她將更形鞏固而成爲一顆最紅的星。不過在財務方面，她在槪總要損失一些。</p>
<p>其次，説到瓊克勞馥。克勞馥今年的成績可謂登峯造極。可是過此以後，好將一年不如一年地失敗下去。在愛的方面，她或自己以爲滿意，可是她終於找不到眞正的愛。要到一九三五年，她才能重新爲人之妻。</p>
<p>説到嘉寳，那簡直是晦氣極了。她今後不能再表現列驚人的成績。假如一九三四她不放棄影壇生活，那末至遲一九三五終要退休，而且是最後的永遠的退本。她將重回她瑞典的故鄕。</p>
<p>珍妮蓋諾這個可愛的小鳥，今年又要做新娘了。縱然本年她不能于歸，可是至遲年底以前，她必定宣布訂婚。未來的郎君要比她年紀大，而且是一個離過婚的男人。一九三五年上她將生一個小寳寳，在影壇上她還有兩年好運。過此以後，她就該退休了。</p>
<p>那末克萊克寳呢？寳一定仍和她現在的丈夫白耳（Rex　Bell）繼續和好下去。她今年將舉一子。這小孩子將來一定會成名。可是究竟從哪一方面－－銀幕，舞臺，或其他？－－出名，現在却還不得而知。</p>
<p>琪恩哈羅今年運氣也不佳。今年將有無數的流言毁謗她在逹氏的圓光鏡上，一切的星座都和哈羅站在敵對的地位。假如她能度此難關，那末將來也有兩年的好運。</p>
<p>凱絲琳海嬪去年是走了好運的。今年却不甚得勢。離然本年她將遇到不少的打擊，可是她終必能够向上爬。今的她個人方面當感到一個很大的痛苦。（未完）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「熱血青年」</h3>
<p>— 綠意</p>
<p>「熱血青年」是天一公司與「青春之火」個性和情調完全相反的作品。導演湯傑是進天一公司第一部作品，在技巧上，比在明星導演的「母與子」進步不少了。全劇用一種沉重滯緩的調子，更能增加悲劇（雖然熱血青年並不是完整的悲劇）的成！小聰明處也有，如用香烟灰來示李父心情的進慮：用克儉子打翻飯桶來象徵克儉父子的失業等。象徵的應用是同「飄零」裏一樣的手法，這可惜成爲天一公司的老調了。</p>
<p>天一公司的作品還有一個共通的缺點，那就是每部作品裏都有幾節滑稽的插穿！在「青春之火」裏是僕人的怪臉相；現在在「熱血青年」裏是那鄰婦的動作和收賬員的神情，最能破壞劇情的嚴肅空氣。製作者爲了要歡迎一般低級趣味而設此，我們實在是不敢贊同。要知滑稽的插穿在輕鬆的喜劇裏還能稍用，在悲苦的情調裏應用了反而大大的削弱了劇力的。</p>
<p>「熱血青年」還拖了一個大尾巴。這個尾巴完全破壞了悲劇的情緒，使觀衆帶回了一個印象：奸商終于被捕了－這雖大快人心而對于克儉父母之死的同情心却消滅了不少！我認爲在結束如果改爲克儉警察至運貨機關時因證據無着以誣告罪入獄，那末在結構上完成了完整的悲劇，于觀衆方面更加强了對奸商的憤恨，那末不更好嗎？</p>
<h3>評「人生」</h3>
<p>— 克洛</p>
<p>在技巧方面，「人生」可以説是超過了一切國產影片。攝影的清晰美妙，設置的合理匀稱，鏡頭的周轉靈活，演員的稱職盡力，都是無懈可擊，而値得令人讚賞的；尤其是這次費穆用了那新頴的導演手法－遲緩的旋律，使每個觀衆的心中都受到沉重的壓迫，而加重了悲劇的力量。</p>
<p>可是，在意識方面，我認爲他不特比不上「春蠶」「鹽潮」等片，却有很大的退化！牠的中心意識是「善」與「惡」的爭鬥，要使人轉「惡」爲「善」，必須用教育的力量。這樣説來，牠就有三個缺點：</p>
<p>（一）沒有着力描寫「惡」的成因；</p>
<p>（二）想用教育的力量來使人轉「惡」爲「善」，簡直是一種幻想。現社會的經濟結構未改善以前，所謂教育，結果被特權階級用來作爲栽培奴才的一種工具，不特不能使人轉「惡」爲「善」，或者還要產生多量作惡的人！</p>
<p>（三）把希望統統放在「未來」，而抛棄了「現實」！</p>
<p>然而站在人道的觀點上説來，這部颢片很有力量令人洒兩點同情之涙的！</p>
<h3>「人生」之我見</h3>
<p>— 越熙</p>
<p>「人生」之演出，雖不敢説已突過了中國影片的一切成績而躍登了世界地位，但，的確是一張不可多得而値得贊美的颢片，尤其是從技巧方面去觀察。</p>
<p>如以「打鐵」象徵着「人生的鍜鍊」，就是劇作者的極聰明地方。固然，這是非有藝術修養的人，不易理解；但以迎合低級觀衆的心理，而故意降低藝術的凖則，這是極不合理而且愚笨不過的事。電影本身，就是負著提高觀衆藝術理解力的使命的。</p>
<p>再如：圖面展示火車進行，接著就是林阮見面．這裏省去不少的不必要的圖面，是很可取的。他如由費柏青抽槍轉到入獄，等都是導演者很經濟的手法，是中國片中未曾多覯的。</p>
<p>光線之清晰，圖面之美妙；無疑地，是無可非難，令人滿意。</p>
<p>演員方面，我覺阮玲玉演得最逼眞，最努力，最成功，也最能給觀衆深刻的印象。費柏青面孔狡滑，洽合劇情，也算是成功的。鄭君里未能給觀衆以深刻印象，我們應該原諒他作戲的機會太少。其餘演員，都能稱職。此外我們那位佔據兒童演員首席的小明星－黎鏗，在這裏，成績似乎還趕不上過去的「城巿之夜」和「人道」（下略）</p>
<h3>評「人生」</h3>
<p>— 徐孟淦</p>
<p>現社會是萬惡的畸形。人生便是描摹叙述這畸形社會的一角。</p>
<p>在「人生」裏的主人翁；一個是從野孩子和奴婢脱胎的路柳牆花，一個是不願意理沒在粉筆灰裏的小學敎員，和他的一個在育嬰堂裏服務的妻子。在這種情形之下，於是便演成了一幕無上愴痛悽慘的悲劇。</p>
<p>關於導演的技術，費穆是比「城巿之夜」中更進步了。他雖然不説明劇中人的一切，但他能假借劇中人的中吻來表明，而且還叙述得有條不紊，這是他獨具特長的作風。</p>
<p>關於演員的表情上。那末以玩玲玉林楚楚最爲動人，黎鑑的天眞，鄭君里的英俊，均皆可取，其他演員亦各能各盡所長。至關攝影佈景及其他，均較前爲進步。</p>
<p>總之：在萌芽時代的國產片中「人生」是一部超特的作品。同時還能够看到中國影業是在突飛猛進着，是緊追着外國片了。</p>
<h3>大上海映「獵艷家」</h3>
<p>充滿着愉快情調的喜劇</p>
<p>「獵艷家」Facing　The　Music，是一部英國出品的音樂喜劇，主角史丹盧璧諾，是「璇宮艷史」滑稽侍者盧别麟的介弟，在歐洲銀壇上的聲譽，不亞於好萊塢的希佛萊，這個亢子，完全是運用美好的音樂，悦耳的歌曲，然後再聨合電影的技術所組合成功的，所以，不但全片滑稽有趣；而裏面所包含的歌曲，都是非常著名的，在劇壇上最有悠久歷史的「浮士德」，其中有「珠寳歌」一曲，也被搬演到膠片上來，這是很値得注意的，並且，飾演那位女角的，也是歐洲一位著名的歌星，最可喜的，就是在導演的明確的描寫之下，各個演員，均能把握着各劇中人特有的個性，喜劇能够有這樣很好的成績，確屬不易，這部片子，已定於今天（七日）起在大上海大戲院開映了。</p>

<h3>克利斯丁娜Queen　Chrina（六）</h3>
<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>一回客店門外，已有人馬喧　的聲音，她知道那隊西班牙人到了。她看着他們一個一個的跑進了客店。她聽見那個欽差問店主人要房間。她看見那让主人搖着肩膀，連聲道歉。店主人眼望着克利斯丁娜，好像説她就是使他沒有房间睡的原因。於是那欽差就急速地跑到她面前。他脱了帽子深深地鞠了一躬。他说：「先生，用我未得識荆，多有失禮之處，現在特地在此告罪了。」克利斯丁娜笑了，她説：「先生，用你不用道樣謙恭，那個金鎊，我是很快樂地賺來的。」那少年又説道：「先生，這眞使我惶恐無地了。克利斯丁娜道：「先生，那亦沒有理由呀。總怪我自己穿的衣服太不像樣了」，她看看自己穿的粗羊皮的上褂，「我們第一次見面，不是衣服的外表，就表示身份的嗎？」那男子看了她道：「先生，我希望你能讓我比較再深切些認識你。你可以給我一個面子，讓我請你吃晚飯呢？」克利斯丁娜道：「同吃晚飯是可惟的祗要你肯讓我作主人。你是遠來的客，我一定要略盡地主之誼。我今天請你吃晚飯，你能賞光嗎？并且你從那裹來的貴國，我是懷着深切的系念的。」那少年欽差一方面推却着，一方面表示驚異地問她：「你知道西班牙嗎？」克利斯丁娜笑道：「西班牙是深知道的。我還想從你探取一些最近的新聞。佛辣斯吉斯有什麽新的藝術作品嗎？加爾特龑臟在瑪德里近來作些什麽？」</p>
<p>他顯然地驚訝起來了。他問：「你上次什麽時候在西班牙的？」克利斯丁娜道：「我去是沒有去過，不過我是常常思念的。」那西班牙人的黑眼睛，透着光彩説道：「多末有趨呀！幸得相會，我心中喜悦，你是不會知道的：：：店主人！」店主人來了。那少年吩咐道：「這位先生，今天同我晚餐，你搶頂好的預備好了。」他然後回過頭來，對着克利斯丁娜道：「你曾得過思鄕病嗎？」克利斯丁娜表示着抱歉道：「我從來沒有離開過瑞典國境。」那少年道：「那你就不會知道那種損失的滋味的。那是一種念舊的傷悼。」克利斯丁娜徐徐地道：「你知道沒有到過的地方，一個人亦會因思家而悒鬰的嗎？「這尤其使他驚佩起來了。他説：「那是當然可以的。這又是第二次我失敬於你了。你是希有的青年。來吧」他拉了她的手，走到食桌前面。</p>
<p>那一頭店主人和他的老婆商量着：那個少年給了二十兩，可是那個外國人答應出三十兩，祇要有一張床睡覺就興。現在他看着克利斯西娜和寻個外國少年，談得很入港，於是他就走了上來。他很狡滑地沒有開口先笑着説道：「我想你們二位先生是很要好的朋友了。如果可以的話，我們可以想個法子，使這位先生亦可以得過安身之處。」他説着乎指着那西班牙欽差。（未完）</p>

<h3>Sun's Troops Violently Attack Ningyuan, Both Sides Engaged in Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>A Large Portion of Reinforcements Arrive</p>
<p>Sun Expresses No Response to Dismissal Order</p>
<p>He Yingqin Convenes Generals to Discuss Handling Sun's Troops</p>
<p>(Beiping) A large portion of the reinforcements has arrived. The battle situation in the front lines in recent days has been extremely fierce. Sun, due to the authorities dismissing him from all his concurrent positions, is determined to take risks and will not abandon his troops. He plans to capture Ningyuan in the short term and, after looting, continue westward. If the strength of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai is too strong, he will proceed westward along the Mongolian border north of Ningxia. Sun has stated that even if he becomes a bandit, he is determined to move westward and will not respond to He Yingqin's telegram. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, Beiping received a telegram from Ningxia stating that the Gansu and Qinghai troops had arrived in Ningxia to reinforce the area. Ma Hongkui's troops within the city are preparing to launch a counterattack. The villages near the provincial capital are still occupied by Sun's troops, while Ma's troops surround the outside of the villages. Both sides have been engaged in fierce fighting for days. Sun's troops have prepared many scaling ladders, intending to break through after the reinforcements arrive and attack the provincial capital again. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Ma Bufang telegraphed on the 5th, stating that Sun's troops have been besieging Ningyuan for over ten days. Fortunately, our soldiers have fought bravely with all their might, and the defenses of the provincial capital and Pingluo are solid. Fierce fighting continued in the front lines for the past two days. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Sun's troops defied orders and moved westward, war broke out in the Northwest. The Central Government originally advocated settling the matter peacefully and did not want the situation to escalate. The Military Affairs Commission repeatedly telegraphed to dissuade him without success. Therefore, Sun was first stripped of his position as the Qinghai Western Region Reclamation Commissioner to cut off his intention to move westward. Yesterday, he was also dismissed from his position as the commander of the 41st Army. If he continues to defy orders, the authorities of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shanxi, and Suiyuan will be responsible for enforcing the order. Although Sun has not yet expressed his attitude, the Military Affairs Commission has already issued a final warning. Therefore, Sun's personnel stationed in Beiping have now left Beiping separately. Yan has expressed his agreement with the Central Government's opinion. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that the destination of Sun's westward advance is northern Shaanxi. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The main force of Sun's troops is currently still concentrated north of the provincial capital of Ningxia, launching fierce attacks on the provincial capital from time to time. The fighting has been extremely intense for days. Zhu Shaoliang ordered Ma Bufang and Ma Buqing's two divisions to advance to Ningyuan and Pingluo for reinforcement. Ma Bufang has arrived near Ningxia, and the Gansu reinforcements are advancing towards Zhongwei and Ningshuo. Sun is very busy going back and forth between Dengkou and Shizuizi to command. Sun's troops, including Lu Fengnian's division and two replenishment regiments transferred from Baotou to Ningxia Province, passed through Linhe on the 3rd and are concentrating in Dengkou. This time, the Military Affairs Commission ordered Yu Shiming to be responsible for commanding Sun's troops to retreat and gather north of Dengkou, and to strictly reduce and reorganize the troops according to the approved number of seven regiments. The approved seven regiments are the 117th Division, the 118th Division, one special service regiment, one company each of engineers and transport troops, and one wireless telegraph team. All the rest will be dismissed. The Military Affairs Commission approved the number of Sun's troops to be 15,000, with a salary of 201,000 yuan paid by the Military Affairs Commission, a monthly subsidy of 40,000 yuan from the Central Government, and a monthly allowance of 70,000 yuan from Shanxi Province. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin convened the generals of North China at Jurentang last night to discuss the handling of Sun's troops. Sun himself is still in the army and has not yet expressed his position on the dismissal order. Ma Hongkui's troops plan to shorten their lines after a considerable period, and to contact Ma Hongbin, Ma Bufang, and Ma Buqing's three divisions to launch a counterattack. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pingluo Still Held by Ma's Troops</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: The Military Affairs Commission received a telegram from Ningxia today stating that Pingluo is still held by Ma's troops and has not been captured by Sun's troops. Sun's cavalry has been discovered in the Dingyuan Post and the Ningshuo area, where Ma Buqing's cavalry is concentrated. The main force of the Gansu army is advancing towards the Yandi Zhongwei Hongjingshan area. Wuyuan and Linhe are still defended by Wang Jingguo's troops from Shanxi. Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry originally stationed one brigade in Pingdiquan, one brigade in Suiyuan, and one brigade in Baotou. It is heard that the brigade stationed in Baotou will move into Linhe. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun's Office in Beiping Closed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's office in Beiping was officially closed today. All the staff in the office were given severance pay by Wang Shiping and dismissed. The office was emptied. Sun's representative, Hu Jie, came to Beiping three days ago and went to Tianjin this morning. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram: Sun's office in Baotou has been automatically withdrawn today. According to the representative of the Military Affairs Commission, Men Bingyue, Pingluo and Ningxia have not been captured by Sun's troops. The rumor that Pingluo and Ningxia have fallen is incorrect. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sun Directing Military Affairs in Dengkou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Those coming to Beiping from Baotou say that Sun's headquarters are still located in Dengkou, and Sun himself is directing military affairs there. There are no traces of Sun's troops east of the Yellow River. Most of Sun's troops are concentrated on both banks of the Yellow River. The fighting in Pingluo has been the most intense in recent days. Sun's troops, led by Bao Liansi, are launching a fierce attack on that area. The 15th Route Army's office in Beiping has not received any information from the front lines for three days, but it is heard that the fighting in the front lines has been extremely intense recently. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Can Avoid Further Investigation If He Obeys Orders</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the Beiping Military Affairs Commission explicitly dismissed Sun Dianying from all his concurrent positions on the 5th, no reply telegram was received from the front lines on the 6th. It is still difficult to predict whether Sun will hand over military power and leave the army in compliance with orders. However, Sun is currently still directing operations in Dengkou, harassing the vicinity of Ningxia. According to various observations, Sun's westward invasion is audacious and self-inflicted. It is feared that he may not immediately realize his mistake. The authorities here believe that if Sun leaves the army and hands over his troops to Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, and others to command, retreating to the area north of Dengkou and implementing a reduction in force, Sun personally can be given a path to self-renewal without further investigation. Otherwise, the matter must be thoroughly resolved to maintain discipline. As for the situation in Ningxia, according to investigations, there is still no change. The rumor that Sun's troops invaded Pingluo cannot be confirmed. The troops stationed in Gansu have now arrived in Ningyuan, preparing for a counterattack. The 41st Army's office in Beiping is being closed due to the cancellation of the army's designation, and all office personnel left Beiping and scattered on the 6th.

<h3>De Wang's Representative Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Reporting on the Current Situation in Western Mongolia</p>
<p>Applying for the Implementation of Autonomy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) De Wang of Silingol League has again sent Dalkhan Qunwang of Sunid Left Banner, Guoerjiazhuoerzhapu, to Nanjing. According to investigations, Guo left Silingol in late December of last year, stayed in Beiping for two months, and arrived in Nanjing from Beiping on the 4th of this month. Those who came from Mongolia include Panchen Lama Bai Yuting and five attendants. King Guo told others that this time he represents De Wang in going to Nanjing purely to report on the recent situation in Mongolian politics and to apply for the issue of autonomy. Before the various Mongolian princes convened a meeting in Bailingmiao, the Japanese sent personnel to Silingol and set up a radio station in Sunid Left Banner. It was only after negotiations that they agreed to withdraw. However, according to Japanese sources, they still need to come to Silingol this spring to set it up. Seeing their intention, it is obviously the first step in the invasion of Western Mongolia. In order to ensure the future safety of Western Mongolia, De Wang has specially sent me to Nanjing to meet with the government authorities. As for the Inner Mongolian autonomy plan, since it was passed by the Central Political Council on the 17th of last month, the Mongolian side has not been able to accept it because the content is different from the eleven articles discussed by Minister Huang in Bailingmiao. De Wang intends to have a memorandum on the above two items, which will be sent to the Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission by myself. As for the recent situation in Western Mongolia, since the Manchurian Incident, the Japanese have been advancing westward step by step. Fortunately, the Mongolian people are deeply aware of righteousness and have not been tempted. Recently, a Chahar-Suiyuan League Flag Office has been established in Duolun. The Mongolian people deeply hope that the Central Government will attach importance to the border troubles and quickly find a way to save the country. They only hope that the Central Government will implement the plan agreed upon in Bailingmiao. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) De Wang's representative, Boin Dalai, came to Beiping from Silingol with King Guo earlier, originally intending to go to Nanjing together to report everything to the Central Government.

He is now scheduled to take the Beiping-Baotou train back to Zhangjiakou at noon on the 7th to handle the affairs of the Silingol Office in Zhangjiakou. After King Guo returns to Zhang from Nanjing, he will return to Western Sunid to report to De Wang. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Prudent Look at the Balkan Pact</h3>
<p>The European continent is fraught with crises, with the potential for explosions everywhere. Some say that today's international relations are even more tense than on the eve of the First World War. This is hardly an exaggeration, even though diplomats from various countries are still trying their best to cover up the situation. At best, they can only temporarily alleviate the situation, but they cannot eliminate the root of the disaster invisibly. The major European powers have been suspicious of each other for a long time, but at present, none of them are willing to take the lead in war and rashly launch an attack. Therefore, a situation of armed peace has been established.</p>
<p>Germany, deeply resentful, is limited by its national strength and cannot easily settle old scores by force. France, enjoying the benefits of the Treaty of Versailles, is complacent and cautious in everything, not daring to act rashly. Italy, under the rule of Mussolini, is deeply dissatisfied with France, but its relationship with Germany is not very good due to its pro-Austrian policy. It is watching the situation to seek its greatest desire. The Soviet Union, due to the increasingly serious situation in the Far East, is unwilling to challenge the Western European countries, lest it be attacked from both sides. Even the Balkan Peninsula countries, known as the powder keg of Europe, have surprisingly become known to the world for drafting a peace pact. The draft of the pact has been signed by Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Turkey. However, Bulgaria has not yet expressed any intention to join. However, if its ruling authorities can be farsighted and carefully consider the pros and cons, they will know that although the establishment of this pact will not help the permanent peace of the Balkans, it is enough to eliminate the dangers of Europe to a certain extent.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why Bulgaria is unwilling to participate in the pact this time. First, it emphasizes the solution of minority issues. Second, it advocates equality in armaments. Third, it seeks access to the Aegean Sea for Bulgaria. Although the full text of the pact has not yet been announced, the four countries including Greece are quite determined to oppose Bulgaria's proposals. We deeply feel that the minority issue is the cause of the Balkan disaster. If a relatively fair solution can be found, then there may be a glimmer of hope for peace. Equality in armaments is originally difficult to achieve perfectly without any bias. The more balance is sought, the more problems arise. Modern countries' armament preparation is all justified by self-defense. In fact, if they can be open and honest with each other, and there is no aggression, then what is so-called self-defense? Therefore, seeking peace through equality in armaments will ultimately not achieve peace. If we truly want to eliminate the scourge of war, we should start by destroying the weapons of killing. Bulgaria's desire to promote equality in armaments in this pact may inevitably repeat the mistakes of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. To go to the Aegean Sea from Bulgaria, it is necessary to pass through Greece. However, Greece will certainly not allow Bulgaria to delve deep into its territory, causing inconvenience to itself. As a result of the European War, Bulgaria lost a lot of land. Bulgaria is firmly opposed to the proposal to maintain the status quo of the Balkans. It is certainly reluctant to comply rashly and work for others if the issue of access to the sea cannot be satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>As for the impact of the Balkan Pact on countries outside the contracting parties, it can be summarized in one sentence: Italian imperialism will be severely hit, and the secret door between France and Italy will become even more intensified. Italy has always regarded invading Yugoslavia as one of its national policies, and France is quite wary of this. If the Balkan Pact is successfully established, Yugoslavia can deal with Italy calmly without worrying about its rear. Seeing the frustration of Mussolini's eastward policy, the French will certainly boast of their diplomatic victory. Whether the result can improve German-Italian relations, or even promote the cooperation of the world's two major pan-nationalist countries, is still uncertain, but the far-reaching significance is generally recognized by those who are aware of the situation.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Coups and Revolutions Abound</h3>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Military Police Suppress Paris</p>
<p>Dismissal of the Police Commissioner Creates a Stir</p>
<p>The Outcome of the House Meeting is Still Uncertain</p>
<p>The New Government is Overwhelmed and Difficult to Sustain</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Daladier government will fight for its survival in the parliament. 30,000 police, gendarmes and soldiers are ready to suppress any riots. Rumors are rife throughout the city, with some even saying that a "coup" and a "revolution" will occur. According to the French Action newspaper, machine guns have been installed in the parliament, and traffic within half a mile of the parliament has been temporarily suspended. Therefore, machine guns may not be used. The Paris garrison is currently preparing in the barracks to be ready to move out at any time. Currently, a cavalry team has been transferred from Senlis, and many tanks have been transported from Compiegne. It is believed that the police force can maintain order and will not use force lightly. The Minister of Interior warned the new Police Commissioner Sipriot that if there are any demonstrations, he will be dismissed. At the same time, this intention was conveyed to police officers at all levels. Therefore, in order to maintain their positions, police officers will definitely work hard to maintain public order. On the other hand, the National Veterans Federation announced that it will send 30,000 people to demonstrate, and the Young Patriots League, the Communist Party, the Fascist Party, and the Royalist Party are also gathering. German newspapers have commented a lot on the recent events in Paris, believing that the Daladier government can still control the overall situation and that the royalist coup is impossible. People from all walks of life in Germany have speculated a lot on the impact of the French Prime Minister's reliance on the issue. The dismissal of former Police Commissioner Chiappe has caused a lot of unease among police officers in Paris. When Mr. Chiappe handed over his office, the crowd cheered to send him off. Paris is indeed in a dangerous state. Currently, there is a lot of controversy over the dismissal of Mr. Chiappe. There are now two questions: If Mr. Chiappe is indeed involved in the Bayonne municipal bond fraud case, then why was he promoted to the position of Governor of Morocco? If there is no relationship, then why was he dismissed? (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Daladier's Declaration Thoroughly Investigates No Corruption</h3>
<p>(Paris) Daladier's cabinet's declaration of major policies will be decided by today's State Council. The main idea is that the government is determined to thoroughly investigate the recent fraud case and intends to organize a parliamentary investigation committee. Secondly, it asks the parliament to re-discuss the budget and pass it. Mr. Daladier also said that he intends to quickly rectify finances and implement economic policies that meet modern needs. Mr. Daladier's major policy is a concise plan that includes everything. Regarding diplomacy, Mr. Daladier still advocates continuing France's consistent policy, which is to respect treaties and consolidate peace. According to responsible sources, the parliamentary investigation committee for thoroughly investigating the fraud case is planned to be composed of representatives elected by the parliamentary political party groups in proportion to the number of seats occupied by each party, rather than directly appointed by the Presidium of the House of Representatives. The committee will enjoy all the powers necessary for investigation. Regarding this point, Daladier and his cabinet members have all agreed. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>The House Meeting is Very Noisy</h3>
<p>Unique in the History of French Constitutionalism</p>
<p>The Government's Life May Not Last Long</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's House meeting was full, and the gallery was also crowded. Premier Daladier had only read his declaration of major policies for ten minutes when the meeting was very noisy, so that the Premier's words could not be heard, so he had to suspend the meeting temporarily. This scene is unique in the history of the French Parliament. The suspension of the meeting had the effect of restoring order. Daladier returned to the meeting and completed his declaration. The Premier then proposed a method: only four opposition parties would be allowed to speak and question today. Mr. Daladier decided to take this as a matter of confidence, so the members engaged in voting.</p>
<p>(Paris) It is expected that the Daladier government, relying on the support of the Socialist Party, can survive after a long and fierce debate in the House of Representatives. However, although Mr. Daladier used his wisdom and published an article urging the people of Paris to be calm, it is feared that even if he wins in the parliament, the life of his government will not last long. Currently, in addition to the danger of street riots, the government is also opposed by the stability side. This can be seen from the cancellation of the Thursday banquet by the Paris City Council. The banquet is an annual event, and the President and new cabinet members are invited. Now it has been suddenly cancelled. It is said that the city councillors refused to share a table with the new cabinet members. It is even rumored that the city council plans to refuse to pass the police budget to resist the newly appointed Police Commissioner Sipriot. Today, the authorities prohibited civilian aircraft from flying over the sky of Paris, except for commercial aircraft. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Cabinet's Major Policy Declaration Maintains the Free System</h3>
<p>Sincere Unity Respects the Law</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Administrative Taxes are Thoroughly Reformed</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a State Council meeting at the Presidential Palace this morning, presided over by President Lebrun. The cabinet's major policy declaration was passed. The declaration will be read in the Senate and House of Representatives in the afternoon. In the House of Representatives, it will be read by Premier Daladier himself. The declaration briefly stated that the new government, which is now attending the parliament, should ask the parliament to judge it based on its actions. The government believes that some public agencies have neglected their duties and lack a sense of responsibility, so it will make changes to their personnel and office methods. As for this year's budget, it must be passed before March 31. After the budget is passed, we must find ways to reduce unemployment and rectify the national economy. Our country's tax system must be thoroughly reformed, abandoning the old, chaotic and complex system, and replacing it with a simple and modern institution, so that taxes can be put on the right track without causing excessive harm to the people. In terms of diplomacy, it is said that Europe is now fragmented and uneasy. Our law should reaffirm the aspiration of peace and security. All French policies can be included in two words: international cooperation and national defense. The ideal of peace cannot be realized only by advocating and promoting it. We must pursue it practically with all our strength, with sincerity, and avoid empty and arrogant actions. But to achieve this goal, the government must have the support of the majority and have strong authority. This is what we hope for from your trust. We must now protect the current system, so that the law and the parliament are respected. Our French ancestors fought bravely in times of crisis to maintain the order of democratic politics. All of us republicans must now unite sincerely and follow the example of our predecessors to maintain the only remaining free system in the world. The free system is the system of human progress. For the sake of national interests and people's welfare, what we want to call for now is the unity of republicans. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Representatives Express Maintaining the Sanctity of the Constitution</h3>
<p>Officials' Appointments and Removals Should Have Standards</p>
<p>(Paris) The House of Representatives members have organized groups to study the issues of administrative reform and the improvement of the working methods of the parliament. The group recently issued the following three hoped-for events: (1) The authority of the government must be maintained. The duties of the parliament are to pass laws and supervise the executive power within the scope of the constitution. The parliament should not exceed these duties. (2) It is right for members of parliament to intervene when they see actions that are unreasonable or beyond the law. However, it is harmful to disturb the principle of equality of all citizens under the law by relying on their power. Therefore, the group hopes that in the future, any intervention by members of parliament in the government and various administrative agencies that is sufficient to destroy the principles of equality and justice should be considered invalid. Equality and justice are the sacred basis of the constitution. (3) When the government selects personnel to appoint the heads of various agencies, it should be based purely on academic knowledge and experience. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Rules Committee of the House of Representatives held a meeting this morning to discuss the organization of an investigation committee to thoroughly investigate the Stavisky case. This matter has been fully approved by the committee in principle. However, it has not yet been determined whether this investigation committee will enjoy judicial power, be able to conduct searches and arrests, according to the precedents of previous years. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Right-wing Groups Demonstrate in Front of the Presidential Palace</h3>
<p>Panic Arises in the Stock Exchange</p>
<p>(Paris) The right-wing "Fiery Cross" group held a demonstration near the Ministry of Interior and the Presidential Palace, and was dispersed by the police and the Republican Guard. In order to prevent disturbances from occurring tomorrow, the government has specially placed the Republican Guard and the guerrilla Guard under the command of the newly appointed Paris Police Commissioner Bonnet-Foy Chaupeau to maintain public order in the capital. The defenses around the Presidential Palace, the State Council, the Ministry of Interior, and the House of Representatives are particularly strict. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Before the political storm broke out, although there was temporary tranquility, the Paris Stock Exchange was in a state of panic today. The price of the pound and the US dollar rose, while the price of the franc fell. Everyone is scrambling to buy international first-class securities, and the prices of French first-class securities have all fallen. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Declaration Demands the Dissolution of the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Dismissal of Officials Damages the Dignity of Paris</p>
<p>(Paris) The Seine Provincial Taxpayers' Federation issued a declaration, saying, "National interests are now seriously harmed." The Federation rejects all party prejudices and asks all members to participate in various demonstrations in Paris tomorrow. The National Taxpayers' Federation recently sent a letter to President Lebrun, asking me to dissolve the House of Representatives and form the Senate into a "Supreme Court" to uphold morality. (According to the French Constitution, presidents and cabinet members who commit serious political crimes, as well as others who commit crimes against the state, are tried by the Supreme Court composed of the Senate.) (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Thirty of the fifty-eight members of the Seine Provincial House of Representatives recently sent a joint letter to the Minister of Interior Frot, protesting the replacement of Paris Police Commissioner Chiappe, saying that the government "sacrificed the responsible official in charge of maintaining public order to appease the troublemakers" for political motives. This kind of move is obviously unfair, and the residents of Paris are extremely dissatisfied. In addition, fifteen members of the Paris City Council issued a letter to the citizens, saying that as a result of the measures taken by the government, Police Commissioner Chiappe and Seine Provincial Governor Reynaud have resigned one after another. This matter is sufficient to damage the independence and dignity of the city of Paris, and a protest is raised. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Prepares</h3>
<p>To Handle the German-Austrian Issue</p>
<p>A Special Meeting Can Be Convened on the 15th</p>
<p>A Disarmament Conference Will Be Convened on the 19th</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to important sources, after the League of Nations discusses the special meeting on the Austrian issue, the Disarmament Conference may be held in Geneva immediately. It is said that if Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss submits a protest to the League of Nations this week regarding Germany's interference in Austria's internal affairs, the League of Nations can meet on February 15. At the same time, the Disarmament Preparatory Committee will prepare in London first, and the General Assembly will be formally convened in Geneva on the 19th. France is currently promoting to all parties, hoping to convene the meeting as soon as possible, but its attitude is still opposed to the proposals of Germany, Britain and Italy. According to the opinions of the French representatives, it is planned to still follow the previous resolutions, and countries are not allowed to increase armaments. (National Electricity, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is believed here that the Austrian representative to the League of Nations, Pflügl, will ask the League of Nations to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Executive Yuan on Monday to discuss the German-Austrian issue. Unexpectedly, news was suddenly received this evening that although the Austrian government still insists on seeking justice from the League of Nations, it plans to submit the case to Geneva after Prime Minister Dollfuss goes to the Hungarian capital. The deadline should be after Friday. There are different explanations for the Austrian government's cautious self-control. Some say it is due to internal affairs changes, and some say it is due to the advice of the British. However, the State Council unanimously insists on seeking justice from the League of Nations, and a thick booklet of files on German-Austrian relations will soon be sent to the major powers to clarify the truth. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Vienna Austria's petition to the League of Nations for protection against German interference in internal affairs was decided after a five-hour discussion at today's cabinet meeting. Prime Minister Dollfuss was authorized by the cabinet to prepare everything and submit the petition to Geneva. However, opinions on this matter in the cabinet are not consistent, because some people feel that this move is inappropriate, one is to increase domestic panic, and the other is to worsen the relationship between Germany and Austria. Moreover, the general public knows that this move is strongly disapproved by the British, while France is traditionally pleased. After Dollfuss was granted special privileges by the cabinet, he immediately sent a telegram to Austria's permanent representative to Geneva, Mr. Pflügl, instructing him to visit Secretary-General Avenol and request the Council to convene an extraordinary meeting to consider Austria's request. At the same time, he sent a telegram to Polish Foreign Minister Beck, making the same request, with Beck being the chairman of this year's Council. It is also heard that the Council may convene a meeting within this week. (National Electricity, 5th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Promulgates New Orders</h3>
<p>Important Steps for War Preparation</p>
<p>Increase the Salaries of the Red Army in the Far East</p>
<p>Benefit Farmers by Exempting Taxes for Six Years</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to the order announced today by the authorities and signed by Communist Party Secretary Stalin and People's Committee and Labor Defense Council Chairman Molotov, this is indeed one of the most important orders in recent years. The order stipulates that the monthly salaries of the Red Army in eastern Siberia and Outer Baikal will be increased, and the monthly salaries of office personnel will be increased by 10% to 30%. Collective farms and their farmers will be exempted from paying harvest to the state for the next six years, and individual farmers will be exempted for three years. According to the authorities, this plan aims to improve the situation of workers and improve the economic situation of residents in these areas and the Buriat-Mongol Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. However, some parties regard this as an important step for war preparation. Because the situation within the territory bordering Manchuria is good, people will be happy to live there. The more migrants there are, the more natural resources can be greatly developed and can greatly benefit the country. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union's People's Committee and the All-Union Communist Party Central Committee's order on special treatment for residents of eastern Siberia has been announced. The meeting was signed by Molotov and Stalin. The text says, in view of the increasing number of people moving to the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Outer Baikal and East Siberian regions, and in view of the fact that we must facilitate their economic settlement and improve the working conditions of manual workers and agency staff who are far from the Soviet Union's cultural center, Therefore, the Soviet Union's People's Committee and the All-Union Communist Party Central Committee ordered that collective farms and collective farmers in the area be exempted from paying grain to the state for six years, and private farmers be exempted for three years. At the same time, it stipulates that certain areas can be exempted from paying other agricultural products, while the remaining areas can reduce the amount of payment. This order also increases the wages of manual workers and agency staff in the area by 10% to 30%, and increases the supply of food to the troops in the Outer Berga region inside and outside the East Siberian region.

<h3>Russian Border Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Japan Feels Threatened</p>
<p>Hishikari Sends Private Individuals to Russia to Ease the Air</p>
<p>Speeches by Important People in Moscow</p>
<p>Tokyo Compares It to a Weak Dog Barking Easily</p>
<p>(Dalian) Hishikari claimed that Soviet Russia obviously cannot understand Japan. He hopes that Soviet Russia will not cause unexpected incidents by making military preparations in the border area of "Manchukuo". Now it is appropriate to send private individuals unofficially to Moscow to ease the tension between the two countries. Soviet Russia seems to have military installations in most of the border area of "Manchukuo". Vladivostok, Spasskaya, Hailanpao, Boli, and Dayouli all have military bases. Is the construction of this kind of military installation for self-defense or for offense? Is Soviet Russia really plotting something? There is no way to know. But we must be very careful at this time and not start a war lightly. Soviet Russia has many misunderstandings about Japan, which is very regrettable. The fact that Soviet Russia has great defense projects in the border area of Siberia is enough to prove that Soviet Russia cannot understand Japan's policy. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Important figures such as Soviet dictator Stalin, Prime Minister Molotov, Foreign Minister Litvinov, and Land Minister Blokhilov have recently made frequent speeches attacking Japan. The comprehensive opinions of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Army on this matter are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Soviet Russia uses its tough foreign speeches to agitate the minds of ignorant nationals and vigorously publicizes the Communist government as a powerful government. (2) There are now more powerful factors of war in Europe than before the World War in 1913, and in a crisis that is on the verge of breaking out, they secretly hope that a war will break out in the Far East because of the lack of economic strength. Soviet Russia is instigated by European countries and makes tough remarks against Japan. (3) After the United States recognized Soviet Russia last year, Soviet Russia's attitude became even more blatant. (4) Weak dogs bark easily. Soviet Russia's second five-year plan has not achieved much. When they scold abroad, there must be unavoidable events in the country. This is their usual diplomatic tactic. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Eastern Railway Issue</h3>
<p>Tense Relations Between Japan and Russia</p>
<p>Russia Accuses Japanese Troops of Not Paying Debts</p>
<p>And Illegally Arresting Russian Workers</p>
<p>Pseudo Police in Heihe Open Fire and Injure People</p>
<p>Pseudo Apologizes to the Soviet Russian Consulate</p>
<p>(Moscow) The situation between Japan and Russia has been quite tense recently. Today, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued two reports, one accusing Japan of refusing to repay the 20 million rubles owed for the expenses of transporting troops in Manchuria by the former Chinese Eastern Railway, and the other accusing Japan of interfering with the Chinese Eastern Railway and imprisoning a large number of Russian workers, all of which are illegal. Last year, Japan paid Russia 435,000 rubles to repay international debts. Japan's management of the Chinese Eastern Railway is still smooth, but recently, goods transported by the Siberian Railway from Germany and other European countries have been delayed, the reason is that the number of freight cars is restricted by Japan. (National Electricity, 5th)</p>
<p>The Japanese and Manchukuo customs and police authorities at the Boli Suifenhe station are wantonly destroying the freight transport between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway. They have arbitrarily limited the daily export freight to 50 vehicles, with the aim of deliberately reducing transportation to this amount. At the same time, it is stipulated that each freight vehicle shall not exceed three vehicles. Their explanation for this method is all attributed to insufficient staff. Seeing that foreign exporters are constantly transporting goods to Vladivostok, the police have prohibited vehicles from connecting to the Ussuri Railway, arrested the staff on the vehicles, and taken other repressive measures. Recently, 24 railway workers came from the Ussuri Railway and were arrested. After being searched for three hours, they were released. These illegal steps by the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities are nothing more than openly destroying the export freight of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (TASS, 6th)</p>
<p>Boli According to news from Heihe, a Chinese city across the Heilongjiang River from Hailanpao, a police officer there suddenly fired his continuous-fire pistol and injured three other police officers. He was arrested and fled. Another team of police opened a volley of fire at him. A car from the Soviet Russian Consulate in Heihe happened to pass by at this time. Consulate staff member Usov was in the car and was injured in the shoulder. The local Manchurian authorities immediately expressed regret and apologized to the Soviet Russian Consulate.

<h3>Upper House Questions on War</h3>
<p>Concentrated on Sino-Russian Problems</p>
<p>Relaxing Relations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Hirota Holds It as a Diplomatic Creed</p>
<p>Akaike Publishes Absurd Arguments</p>
<p>Attempting to Interfere in Our Fujian Province's Internal Affairs</p>
<p>Sino-American Aviation and the Development of Soviet Areas</p>
<p>Believed to Violate the Non-Cession Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The focal point of today's parliament is concentrated in the Upper House. The plenary session of the House convened at 10:10 AM today. After Minister Nagai and Mr. Seki Naohiko conducted a question-and-answer session regarding the South Seas Development Company issue, Viscount Okouchi Teruhiko took the stage to question:</p>
<p>Regarding diplomatic issues, I would still like the Foreign Minister to provide an explanation. Currently, there are quite a few people discussing the impending occurrence of a world war. Furthermore, regarding issues such as Japanese-Soviet relations and Sino-Japanese relations, I would like a detailed explanation of the diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, it can be said that there is absolutely no danger of such a war. I am absolutely certain of this. As for Japanese-Soviet relations, I feel there is no cause for pessimism. I believe there will be appropriate policies to deal with it. As for Sino-Japanese relations, so-called anti-Japanese movements are merely temporary phenomena. Sino-Japanese relations must be amicable, no matter what. I am using</p>
<p>this creed to deal with the current situation.</p>
<p>Viscount Okouchi asked:</p>
<p>Although the Foreign Minister said that war will not occur, the Army and Navy authorities said that they can explain this in a way that the people can decide. What is the meaning of this?</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi and Army Minister Hayashi both made simple replies:</p>
<p>This matter should be carried out in conjunction with diplomatic work, and it is also necessary to strengthen national defense.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Akaike Nou rose to ask:</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation of the three major countries surrounding Japan, we must consider it carefully. A gloomy atmosphere pervades, and people feel the same way. We must not blindly deal with this kind of international situation. First of all, we should carefully observe the actions of Soviet Russia. Recent reports from Manchuria say that Koreans working in Manchuria have recently been returning to Korea in batches. The reason given is that war between Japan and the Soviet Union is imminent. The reason is that Soviet Russia has 150,000 to 190,000 troops stationed on the border of Manchuria and has built permanent fortresses. In addition, based on Stalin's remarks and combining the above-mentioned situations, it can be seen that the people of Manchuria can hardly live and work in peace. Therefore, it is felt that "Manchukuo" must now seek security outside the country. What kind of diplomatic work should the Foreign Minister implement for the sake of "Manchukuo's security"? I would like Foreign Minister Hirota to answer in detail.</p>
<p>At noon, the parliament announced a recess.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The plenary session of the House of Peers continued in the afternoon. Regarding Mr. Akaike's question, Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>I feel that the points Mr. Akaike mentioned deserve great attention. I feel that my relationship with Soviet Russia is extremely important, so I continue to negotiate with various people related to Soviet Russia, working day and night to avoid any mistakes. Regarding the positions of "Manchukuo" and Japan, we should seek understanding from the world. I will continue to work hard in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Akaike asked again:</p>
<p>Fujian must not be ceded to any country. This is clearly stated in the treaty and has now been violated. These items are stated below. First, the China National Aviation Corporation, most of whose capital is provided by the United States, is nominally a commercial flight, but in essence, it is used for military purposes. This clearly violates the said treaty. If Xiamen is used as a base for flights, Taiwan can be reached in the shortest time. This is a fact that is extremely worrying for Japan's national defense.</p>
<p>Second, the Soviet area in China is expanding greatly, and therefore it has been violated. The development of the Soviet area, in other words, is a secession. Areas within China under the guidance of the Third International may create a new republic. Even if there is no major problem now, there will inevitably be a problem in the future, so it is inconvenient to treat it as if we are watching a fire from across the river.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese relationship in the Fujian treaty, it can be divided into two items: one is the non-cession of land, and the other is matters related to military affairs. If the China National Aviation Corporation is indeed of a military nature, as Mr. Akaike said, it violates the second item of the treaty. However, it is necessary to investigate in detail whether the aviation company is of a military nature. As for the claim that the United States and China have a secret agreement, we will cooperate with the military authorities to pay as much attention as possible to this point. Regarding the communist bandits in China, if we talk about the theories and claims of the Communist Party, they have a consistent point of view, but the current Chinese</p>
<p>communist bandits are not in the situation that Mr. Akaike said, because their organization is also very weak. (Nippon Rengo Electric, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Reveal</h3>
<p>Secrets of the Naval Conference</p>
<p>Rumor That the United States Purchased British and French Islands in the South Pacific</p>
<p>Intended to Encircle Japanese Mandated Islands</p>
<p>To Connect With the Philippines</p>
<p>Purchase Cost to Be Paid With a Portion of War Debts</p>
<p>London Dispatch: The Daily Express published a headline in large letters on the 28th of last month, "Secrets of the Pacific: The United States is Discussing Methods of Outflanking Islands Under Japanese Rule." The content stated that the British Far East Naval Conference convened in Singapore this time discussed the issue of Britain and France selling islands in the South Pacific to the United States, such as the United States buying the Marquesas Islands from France, and buying Nauru, the Bismarck Archipelago, and other islands from Britain, in order to outflank the southern part of the Japanese mandated islands and connect with the Philippines. As for the purchase cost, it will be roughly offset by a portion of the war debt. The United States plans to build ports and airfields on these islands after purchasing them, using them as commercial bases in peacetime and as bases for warships and aircraft in wartime, etc. Although this news is not entirely credible, at a time when the Singapore Conference is giving people an impression of extreme secrecy, this unexpected article has caused great shock in all quarters.

<h3>The British Government</h3>
<p>Attention to Far East Trade</p>
<p>Some People Advocate Forming a Manchuria Commercial Investigation Team</p>
<p>Australian Dignitaries Plan to Seek a Compromise on Trade With Japan</p>
<p>(London) In the House of Commons today, there were suggestions to organize a British Chamber of Commerce delegation to "Manchukuo" and to investigate the dumping of Japanese cement in Hong Kong. The person who raised the issue of the commercial delegation to Manchuria was Captain Dowell of the Conservative Party. Mr. Colville, Minister of Overseas Trade, replied that a trade official was stationed in Harbin in 1930, but was soon transferred to Peiping because the position in Peiping was more urgently needed than in Harbin. The British commercial interests in Manchuria are adequately represented by the British Consulate. However, he is well aware of the importance of Mr. Dowell's proposal, and the government will pay close attention to this situation. Conservative Mr. Hamsley raised the issue of Japanese cement dumping in Hong Kong. Malcolm MacDonald (son of the British Prime Minister) replied on behalf of the government that the Colonial Secretary had contacted the Governor of Hong Kong about this matter. After considering various circumstances and Hong Kong's trade preferences, the Governor felt that it was not appropriate to interfere with such imported goods. The Governor is now doing his best to promote the use of British cement as much as possible within the colony. A Reuters dispatch from Melbourne stated that Mr. Latham, who holds the three important positions of justice, diplomacy, and industry in the Australian government, will go to the Far East on March 7 for a three-month tour. Mr. Latham will visit China, Japan, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, and Malaysia, and plans to go to Vietnam and the</p>
<p>Philippines. According to Melbourne official sources, the purpose of Mr. Latham's trip is to enhance friendship between Australia and its northern neighbors, and his mission is not limited to trade. Although the official arena released this news, according to general speculation, one of the main purposes of Mr. Latham's trip is to negotiate a compromise in order to eliminate the possibility of a commercial war between Australia and Japan. Recently, with the low value of the Japanese currency, Australia has proposed increasing taxes to restrict the entry of Japanese goods. Japan replied that Japan purchases more from Australia than it sells to Australia. If Australia raises tariffs on Japanese goods, Japan will abandon Australia and turn to other places to purchase the wool it needs. (Reuters Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Molotov's Report</h3>
<p>The Second Five-Year Plan of Soviet Russia</p>
<p>(Moscow) Mr. Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet Union's Council of People's Commissars, made a lengthy report to the Communist Party Congress on the Second Five-Year Plan, stating that</p>
<p>the first basic political task of the First Five-Year Plan was to completely eliminate capitalist components and (generally speaking) classes, completely eliminate class divisions and exploitation, overcome the remnants of capitalism in the economy and people's minds, and transform all the working people of the Soviet Union into active creators of a classless socialist society. The second task was to improve the well-being of workers and collective farmers. The consumption standards of the working masses will increase five to three times. The third issue was to complete the technical transformation of the entire national economy, such as industry, transportation, agriculture, etc.</p>
<p>These three are united and indivisible, and at the same time, they determine the essence of socialist construction in the Second Five-Year Plan. They can be proposed today on the basis of the successful and victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan. At the beginning of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, capitalist components in the Soviet Union still occupied an important position. By the end of the First Five-Year Plan, the capitalist components in the industrial sector were no longer significant. Cooperative and state trade have taken a dominant position. Therefore, during the implementation period, private business was almost completely excluded from trade. The struggle to eliminate capitalist components in rural areas was far more difficult. However, at the beginning of the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan, the adoption of the collective farming system has been effective in the most important agricultural areas. At the same time, the rich peasant class has been destroyed. "To this day, collective and state farms have occupied 84.7% of the area under grain cultivation. Therefore, we can say that the collective farming system has achieved complete victory. The remnants of the rich peasant class will inevitably be eliminated rapidly and finally. At the same time, the only way for private farms to gradually transform into collective farming."</p>
<p>Mr. Molotov then stated that when the Second Five-Year Plan is completed, socialist forms will occupy a monopoly position in all sectors of the economy. After the completion of the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will become a solid socialist republic.</p>
<p>Mr. Molotov further elaborated on the various issues of the Second Five-Year Plan, such as eliminating the factors that generate class differences and the relationship of exploitation between people, and overcoming the remnants of capitalism in the economy and people's minds. He said that if we want to complete these tasks, we must strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat with all our strength, strengthen its power and combat effectiveness, and consolidate the alliance between the working class and the working peasants. When Mr. Molotov mentioned the improvement of the material and cultural level of the workers, he said, "The phenomenon of unemployment in the Soviet Union has disappeared. Workers have full confidence in the future. At the same time, with the elimination of poverty in the countryside, the phenomenon of farmers being divided into rich and poor peasants has also disappeared. The constant improvement of the material level of the working masses and the rapid increase in the welfare of the peasant masses are proved by their increased demand for culture and other needs. "Therefore, the Party and the government have shouldered this task, that is, to expand the food industry and the general light industry to improve the consumption standards of the working masses."</p>
<p>The main economic task of the Second Five-Year Plan is to completely complete the technical transformation of the national economy and, on this basis, greatly expand our country's productive forces. This task requires its complete completion in all sectors of industry, agriculture, and transportation. Although the Soviet Union is lagging behind the United States in some economic sectors, it will surpass all European countries in terms of technical level and total industrial products. All this will fundamentally change the Soviet Union and the capitalist world, and at the same time, make the conflict between the two systems of socialism and capitalism enter a newer and higher level. The industrialization policy expressed in the Second Five-Year Plan further increases the proportion of industrial production in the total national production, that is, almost to 80%. In this way, the Soviet Union will be on par with the countries with the highest degree of industrialization in the world, such as Germany and the United States.</p>
<p>Industrial production must increase by 2.4 times compared with the First Five-Year Plan, and will increase by 9 times compared with the pre-war level. During the First Five-Year Plan, the industry that manufactured production tools developed relatively rapidly, and during the Second Five-Year Plan, we have been able to accelerate the development of both heavy industry and light industry at the same time, and we have been able to make it develop particularly rapidly in the production of general consumer goods. Mr. Molotov also pointed out the necessity of developing local and handicraft industries, and listed the tasks of the most important industrial sectors. He said, "By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, 80% of the total industrial production must be manufactured by factories newly built or completely rebuilt during the First and Second Five-Year Plans. At the same time, 50% to 60% of the production tools used in the national economy at that time will be manufactured during the Second Five-Year Plan. We have shouldered this task, that is, to complete the technical transformation with tools made in our country." Mr. Molotov detailed the achievements of the machine industry. This industry has manufactured various machines for various sectors of industry, and its production quantity in the world's machine production has increased from 4% in 1928 to 21.4% in 1933. When Mr. Molotov mentioned electrification, he said that the Soviet Union will rank second in the world in terms of the amount of electricity produced. He also listed the expected development status of petroleum, coal, peat and chemical industries, as well as steel and other metallurgical industries in the Second Five-Year Plan. When Mr. Molotov mentioned light industry, he said that the Second Five-Year Plan will increase the production of general consumer goods by three times. At the same time, when the Second Five-Year Plan ends, the Soviet Union will rank first in the world in terms of the level of technical equipment. In terms of food industry production, it will rank first in Europe. He particularly emphasized that various industries must focus on improving the quality of production.</p>
<p>Mr. Molotov discussed agricultural production, saying that there were indeed huge difficulties during the organization period, and now the process of changing private management to collective farming has been largely completed, so agriculture has incomparably superior conditions for rising. The total agricultural production in the Second Five-Year Plan will increase greatly. In 1937, it will reach 110,560,000 tons, while in 1932, it was 69,870,000 tons. The Second Five-Year Plan does not stipulate a sharp increase in the sown area. The main issue is to increase crop yields. Animal husbandry also has very important issues. The Second Five-Year Plan stipulates that the number of livestock must increase greatly. "In order to make agriculture rise rapidly, we must consolidate the economic foundation of collective and state farms."</p>
<p>Molotov then described the most important tasks of the transportation industry. Compared with 1932, the freight volume in 1937 increased as follows: railways by 178%, river transport by 245%, and sea transport by 280%. In order to complete this extreme increase, the technical transformation of the transportation industry, especially the railway, must be regarded as the central issue. He also mentioned the work stipulated in the plan in the transportation industry, such as the double-tracking of the Ural-Kuznetzk-Donets coal area, Outer Baikal and Ussuri railways, the adoption of automatic block signal methods, the increase of vehicles and the increase of railways, etc. (The trunk line project from Baikal to Amur is extremely huge and important). All this is intended to eliminate the phenomenon that today's transportation industry is lagging behind the general development of the national economy. Mr. Molotov then mentioned the work of developing waterways. He said that the canal from the Volga River to Moscow (127 kilometers long) is being dredged, and the canal from the Volga River to the Don River (100 kilometers long) will also be built during the Second Five-Year Plan. By then, the European part of the Soviet Union will have a great waterway system. Mr. Molotov also listed the plans for overhauling and rebuilding river and sea transport,</p>
<p>developing automobile and air transportation, building new highways, and developing radio communications. Mr. Molotov emphasized that the implementation of technical transformation must have a struggle to win production technology. Mr. Molotov mentioned labor issues, saying that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the efficiency of industrial labor will increase by 63%, the production cost will decrease by 26%, and the factory-affiliated schools will graduate 2.7 million skilled workers. Agricultural vocational schools will train 1.5 million agricultural workers. Within five years, 5 million new workers participating in industry will be trained. The number of experts graduating from universities will also increase, and scientific and technical work will continue to develop. Mr. Molotov said, "We have learned a lot from foreign technology and foreign experts. We have not forgotten these lessons. Therefore, we have a large number of new talents in science and technology. During the Second Five-Year Plan, we will rely more on the achievements of Soviet technology in the technical transformation of our national economy. All this will be able to make the Soviet Union's productive forces develop rapidly. This kind of development has never been seen in any capitalist country. When the Second Five-Year Plan ends, the Soviet Union's position among the world's powers in terms of production will change greatly. Before the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's production accounted for the fifth place in the world. Before the Second Five-Year Plan, it has accounted for the third place in the world, and the second place in Europe. When the Second Five-Year Plan ends, the Soviet Union will jump to the second place in the world in terms of production, and will rank first in Europe. The task of catching up with and surpassing capitalist countries in economics and technology will be realized in practice."</p>
<p>When Mr. Molotov mentioned construction work and the redistribution of productive forces, he pointed out that a more accurate distribution of the Soviet Union's productive forces, a more even distribution of factories throughout the country, and making industry close to raw material supply areas and electricity sources, etc., are the characteristics of the investment plan in the Second Five-Year Plan. The total investment in various sectors of the national economy will reach 133,000,000,000 rubles, while it was only 50,000,000,000 rubles in the First Five-Year Plan. The investment in the industrial sector will reach 69,000,000,000 rubles, and the investment in the agricultural sector will increase from 900 million rubles in the First Five-Year Plan to 1.5 trillion rubles. Within these five years, 94 newly established machine manufacturing plants will start construction.</p>
<p>Mr. Molotov mentioned the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working masses. He said that the status of workers has improved dramatically during the First Five-Year Plan. The elimination of unemployment and the fact that our country's workers do not have to worry about tomorrow are of the greatest value. At the same time, the status of farmers has also changed significantly. In the past, the poverty level of rural areas deepened like a river going downhill, but today its status is increasing day by day. We no longer have the danger of unemployment. On the contrary, the number of employees has increased by 29% within five years, and workers are not threatened by excessively long working hours every day. On the contrary, the daily working hours have been reduced to seven hours, and under more difficult working conditions, they have been reduced to less than six hours." When Mr. Molotov discussed the income of workers and employees, he paid special attention to the increase in real wages. In the plan, this kind of wage will increase by one. The total wage fund will increase from 320 billion rubles to 510 billion rubles within five years. The average wage of workers and employees will increase by 22%.</p>
<p>The Second Five-Year Plan stipulates that illiteracy must be completely eliminated, and the implementation of compulsory vocational education will be universally adopted. The total number of teachers and students will increase greatly. All young children will be able to enter kindergartens. Other facilities such as clubs, libraries, radio stations, scientific research institutes, and scientific workers will also increase sharply. Mr. Molotov also detailed the improvement of health services, the expansion of living areas, and the increase in the supply of urban and rural workers. The average per capita consumption of major items will increase by 2.5 to 3 times within five years, and the average consumption of industrial goods will also increase.</p>
<p>Mr. Molotov then compared the position of the Soviet Union with that of capitalist countries, saying, "From 1928 to 1932, the national income of the United Kingdom decreased by 16.9%, but the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 32% during the same period. Capitalist countries have no five-year plan and no clear goals. Their leaders can never try to restore the level of 1928 even after five years. The position of the Soviet Union is different. We have a clear vision, just as the Second Five-Year Plan has stipulated. We will constantly and sharply increase our total national income, that is, we must carry out this task, so that this income will increase by 138% compared with 1932, and by 332% compared with 1923."

<h3>Britain Builds</h3>
<p>New Military Aircraft</p>
<p>(London) According to the "Daily Mail", the Ministry of Aviation has just ordered the construction of a twin-propeller aircraft with two rudders. Its style is larger than that of the Lacierva (the Spanish inventor, the inventor of the twin-propeller aircraft). According to the newspaper, this aircraft is considered by the army and navy to have important strategic value, because on the one hand, this aircraft can stay in the air, almost motionless, which is very useful when conducting reconnaissance, and on the other hand, its flight speed is almost equal to that of ordinary aircraft.

<h3>International Train Robbery Suspects</h3>

<h3>Balkan Pact</h3>
<p>Nature Belongs to Defense</p>
<p>Athens newspapers enthusiastically approve the initial signing of the Balkan Peninsula Consultation Pact, saying that according to the pact, the signatory countries only mutually guarantee their common borders in the Balkan Peninsula, and its defensive nature is very obvious. The pact will be formally signed at the Athens Academy of Sciences on Thursday afternoon. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the initial signing of the Balkan Consultation Pact, the Turkish government immediately conducted negotiations with the Greek government, intending to establish a customs union between the two countries to supplement it. It is reported that the Turkish Minister of Economy will go to Athens soon to organize the draft customs union treaty, and it is hoped that other signatory countries of the Balkan Consultation Pact will also follow suit. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Sofia, this semi-official source has announced Bulgaria's attitude towards the Balkan Pact concluded by Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia. It is said that Bulgaria is willing to join non-aggression treaties within the League of Nations framework and in accordance with the Kellogg-Briand Pact, as this is the best way to consolidate Balkan peace. Informed sources now say that the reason why Bulgaria did not join the Balkan Pact is because it could not obtain certain concessions, such as a corridor to the Aegean Sea, which caused dissatisfaction. However, the hope that Bulgaria can be persuaded to sign to consolidate the effectiveness of the pact has not yet been abandoned. Informal talks are now underway to achieve this goal. It is reported that the new pact stipulates economic and political cooperation among the countries, and opposes the revision of the Treaty of Versailles, so it is no less than a Locarno Pact for the Balkans. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The news of the initial signing of the Balkan Consultation Pact has been warmly welcomed here. Responsible parties said that the pact is in line with France's consistent policy. Before now, the Balkans were the most chaotic area in Europe. With the completion of the pact, the situation in the peninsula can be considered stable. It is also said that the reconciliation of the Balkan Peninsula countries is out of their own free will, so the signing of the pact is out of the countries' own initiative, which is in line with France's consistent principle of respecting the sovereignty of all countries. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Although people in London are pleased about the imminent signing of the Balkan Consultation Pact, they remain silent about Bulgaria's non-participation in the so-called "Eastern Locarno Treaty." At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, someone asked the government how to instruct representatives stationed in foreign countries to express their attitude towards this pact. Foreign Secretary Simon said, "The government has ordered representatives stationed in the relevant countries to notify the governments of the respective countries that the British government supports the pact concluded by the countries of the Balkan Peninsula for the sake of general peace, but only on the condition that this pact does not oppose any country or any group of countries. Therefore, it is hoped that the articles of the Balkan Consultation Pact will be carefully considered so that Bulgaria can also join." (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>

<h3>Xiao Ke</h3>
<p>Two bandit lairs have been destroyed.</p>
<p>The remnants of the two bandits are fleeing in disarray.</p>
<p>The First and Second Columns are still pursuing and suppressing them.</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: He Jian, the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Bandit Suppression Army, considered Xiao Ke and Kong Hechong's bandit gangs in the western region to be the largest. Recently, he specially dispatched Liu Jianxu, the commander of the First Column, to station in Lianhua, Jiangxi, to command the 15th Division (Wang Dongyuan), the 16th Division (Peng Weiren), and the 63rd Division (Chen Guangzhong), among others, to suppress Xiao's bandits. He also sent Liu Yinggu, the commander of the Second Column, to station in Wanzai, Jiangxi, to command the 18th Division (Zhu Yaohua), the 50th Division (Yue Sen), and the 62nd Division (Tao Guang), as well as the Tao-Liu Brigade of the 19th Division (Li Jue), to suppress Kong's bandits. On the First Column's side, after two or three months of using the "blockhouse advancement method," building blockhouses step by step towards Xiao's old lair, Yongxin, scores of battles, large and small, occurred. In the middle of last month, Peng Weiren's division braved the snow and occupied the natural stronghold of the Meihua Mountains. Xiao's bandits, knowing that Yongxin could not be defended, abandoned their lair and fled, crossing the Rui River through Anfu and heading towards Gao'an and Shanggao, attempting to join up with Kong's bandits. Liu Jianxu, in addition to ordering Wang Dongyuan and Chen Guangzhong's divisions to handle the post-banditry affairs in the bandit areas and clear out the remnants of bandits in the Yongxin Meihua Mountains area, also sent Peng Weiren's division to track and pursue them. On the evening of the 31st of last month, they had already pursued them to Shangfen, and it is expected that they will catch up in two or three days this month, as the 18th Division (Zhu Yaohua) is blocking their path ahead. At that time, they will be attacked from both sides, inflicting a major blow on Xiao's bandits. On the Second Column's side, the various units only completed their deployment on the 27th of last month. At dawn on the 28th, they launched a four-pronged attack on Kong's bandits' old lair, Xiaoyuan. It is found that Xiaoyuan was the place where the pseudo-Soviet government of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border area issued orders, called Little Moscow by the bandits. Located northwest of Wanzai, surrounded by towering mountains and ridges, it has always been a bandit den. In the Ming Dynasty, there was the bandit Li Daluan, and in the Qing Dynasty, there were the "shed bandits" Zhu Yiwu, who used it as their nest.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>They caused trouble for decades before they were finally suppressed. Kong's bandits had also occupied it for six or seven years. The National Army restrained by them numbered as many as five or six divisions. This time, Liu Yinggu personally stationed in Wanzai to launch a major suppression. The original plan was to prepare for at least a week of major battles. Unexpectedly, because the important points near Xiaoyuan were lost early, and the nest had been blockaded for too long, lacking both rice and salt, Kong's bandits did not resist once the Western Route Army launched its suppression, and immediately abandoned their nest and fled. At 5 PM on the 28th, the Tao-Liu Brigade of the 19th Division was the first to occupy Xiaoyuan. It was heard that Kong's bandits led their troops around the mountain roads from Zaoqiao and Ganfang, rushing towards Fengxin and Gao'an, attempting to join up with Xiao's bandits. Liu Yinggu, in addition to leaving the Tao Brigade stationed in Xiaoyuan to clear out the remnant bandits and handle the aftermath, also sent Zhu Yaohua and Yue Sen's divisions to track and pursue them. Therefore, both Xiao and Kong's bandits have lost their lairs and are fleeing everywhere. This is the biggest victory since the bandit suppression. The two columns are now preparing for a major encirclement, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Appended below is the news of victory:</p>
<p>Telegram from Liu Jianxu, Commander of the First Column: "According to telegrams from Division Commander Peng Weiren on the 30th, based on reports from various sources, Xiao's bandits have passed through the Jiebu border (located between Shanggao and Gao'an) and crossed the Rui River. The entire group crossed the river after dusk and arrived near Tongan in the forenoon of the 31st. The 18th Division is blocking their path there. Also, the bandit Gao Yongsheng (a division commander in Kong's force) secretly fled to Ganfang (southwest of Fengxin). It appears that Xiao and Kong's bandits are planning to join up. My division arrived in Shangfen on the 30th evening and will continue to advance tomorrow. We have been traveling at least 70 to 80 li per day, and morale is very high. We are determined to disregard everything and pursue bravely to annihilate these bandits. I have ordered a fierce advance to detect and suppress the bandits, aiming to achieve merit and annihilation. Respectfully reported, your subordinate Liu Jianxu, Eastern Seal."</p>
<p>Telegram from Liu Yinggu, Commander of the Second Column: "Kong and Xiao's bandits are hoping to join up. At this moment, Kong's bandits are fleeing from Zaoqiao and Ganfang, harassing the Fengxin area, while Xiao's bandits are heading towards Jiebu and Huayang, attempting to cross the river northwards between Gao'an and Shanggao. However, it is not easy for the bandits to move in safe areas, and the Xiaoyuan bandit lair has been destroyed. I have no worries about the rear. I have already ordered the various units to relentlessly pursue and suppress the two bandits, Kong and Xiao. The deployment is in place. I expect to be able to annihilate these bandits and eliminate the major problem in the near future. Respectfully presented, your subordinate Liu Yinggu, kowtowing, world seal." (February 3rd)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Rural Pacification in Southern Hubei</h3>
<p>More than 20 bandit lairs destroyed, dozens of bandit leaders captured and killed.</p>
<p>More than a thousand remnant bandits fled from Yangxin into Tongshan territory.</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The remnant bandits in southern Hubei, including the pseudo-3rd Red Division, the Northern Jiangxi Division, and the Guard Division, led by bandit leaders Ye Jinbo, Zhang Shou, etc., previously besieged Tongshan and Chongyang counties one after another, attempting to occupy the Hunan-Hubei road and disrupt transportation. After being jointly defeated by the National Army units led by Feng Xingxian, they fled south to the Mushigang and Dawushan areas in Yangxin territory, remotely contacting the Jiangxi bandits in Xiaoyuan and seeking opportunities to disturb the Yangtze River. Upon receiving the report, Chen Jicheng ordered Guo Rudong, Liu Peixu, and Li Zongjian's units to jointly suppress them, repeatedly defeating the remnant bandits. The lairs in Mushigang and Dawushan were all recaptured. Initially, when the bandits invaded Chongtong, their strength was no less than four or five thousand men, and their momentum was huge. Pu and Xian counties were all threatened. After fleeing south, their momentum declined daily. Guo, Li, and Liu's three units engaged in battle for weeks with fresh troops, and the main force of the bandits completely collapsed. Three pseudo-division commanders were killed in battle, and the bandits also suffered losses. Afterwards, the National Army was victorious everywhere it went. Only a little over a thousand remnant bandits remained, unable to resist. Recently, they fled north again to Tongshan, hoping to prolong their lives. Chen Jicheng, believing that the main force of the bandits had been eliminated, decided to launch a large-scale rural pacification to eliminate the remnants. He had already organized a rural pacification corps, divided into districts to search. In a few days, he would separately destroy and recover the total sub-offices of the remnant bandits and their bases, totaling 21 places, including Tiantai Mountain, Baishuitai, Chengmi Gong, Jiangtang Fort, Shitoutan, Zhu Jia Shan, Longjiao Shan, Xiang Jia Shan, Liu Zhong Shan, Dong Qing You Mountain Village, Guo Jia Shan, Song Jia Zhai, Hua Jia Shan, Nanchang Fort, Dong Jia Houshan, Beishantou, Jinpen Shi, Daqin Yan, Wu Ba Chong, Yu Jia Gang, and Chuan Jia Shan. Among them, Tiantai Mountain was the main base, and the general office was located in Chengmi Gong. Xiang Jia Shan and Liu Zhong Shan were the general offices of the bandits' eight agencies, including (1) the pseudo-rising district Soviet government, (2) the pseudo-Communist Party district committee, (3) the pseudo-Young Communist district association, (4) the pseudo-district labor union, (5) the pseudo-mutual aid society, (6) the pseudo-pro-Soviet grand alliance, (7) the pseudo-district work group, and (8) the pseudo-district team headquarters. The remaining places, such as Guo Jia Shan, were all important bandit dens. The bandit leaders who were beheaded or captured, in addition to the pseudo-Jiangxi Northern Division Commander Yang Xicheng, the pseudo-Deputy 3rd Division Commander Liu Yonghong, the pseudo-Hebei Independent 2nd Division Commander Liu Jihui, and the pseudo-Regimental Commander Wu Yingrui, who were killed in battle during the suppression by Guo's division, the remaining bandit leaders who were captured and beheaded by the rural pacification corps included the pseudo-Young Pioneer general commander and county committee member Song Zhangde, the pseudo-trial department head and political security bureau special envoy and county committee member Zuo Lihu, the pseudo-military commander and county committee member Huang Zhongshi, the pseudo-Young Communist county committee member Huang Meiyun, the pseudo-farmers' association president Song Qixun, the pseudo-rising district committee members He Shenming, Xiang Xiangzhi, Hu Qiyun, Li Yufu, and Song Qizheng, the pseudo-liaison officers Yang Qijiang and Wan Zhengli, the pseudo-mutual aid society chairman Xiao Dafa, the pseudo-cadre training class instructor Ke Xugui, the pseudo-Young Women's Pioneer captain Wu Yu Shi, the pseudo-Youth Women's Group leader Xiang Xiao Shi, the pseudo-Youth League leader Zou Hezhen, the pseudo-Red Labor Union Committee member Huang Dequan, the pseudo-Youth League leader Liu Yunli, the pseudo-Women's Department Minister Xu Yu Shi, the pseudo-branch secretaries Zhang Zhaokai, Fang Xiangde, and Fang Xiangda, the pseudo-confiscation section chief Liu Zhengbang, the pseudo-gray organization executive committee member Dong Ruizhi, the pseudo-town Soviet chairmen Xiang Fuchen, Luo Zhengde, Hu Yunfa, and Yin Benlu, the pseudo-village representatives Cheng Qixian and Xiang Liangxing, the pseudo-general liaison office chairman Cheng Gongfu, the branch office chairman Yuan Yiping and Yuan Yichen, the pseudo-mutual aid society member Ye Kaiqi, the pseudo-gray group leader Yu Junzhi, the pseudo-sentry Cao Maopu and Chen Sima, the pseudo-worker organization minister Chen Jingkun, the pseudo-Young Communist executive committee member Li Fushen, the pseudo-comfort team leader Chen Shi Shi, the pseudo-Youth Worker Minister Xiao Shili, the pseudo-county Soviet committee Chen Guangxin, the bandit-colluding Baozhang Xiang Longyu, and the bandit-colluding Jiazhang Liu Xianxing and Yuan Fuping, totaling more than fifty people, have all been executed separately. There are also the pseudo-Labor Union Standing Committee member Ke Dashu, the pseudo-Beishan Work Group Chairman Tian Tianshun, the pseudo-Young Communist Committee member Yuan Huicheng, the pseudo-County Soviet Government Inspector Qin Guangming, the pseudo-Battalion Deputy Liu Jiayu, and the pseudo-Eastern Hubei Provincial Committee Member Duan Qichun, etc., who surrendered and turned against the communists, remaining in the corps to work. As for the refugees from various places, because the bandit areas have just been recovered, they are returning one after another, lacking both clothing and food, and suffering greatly. Upon receiving the report, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the provincial government on the 5th, ordering them to quickly accept and resettle them in order to save the survivors and cultivate vitality.

<h3>Post-Disaster Issues in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Chairman Chen Yi Convenes Meetings of Various Committees</p>
<p>Dividing Various Tasks such as Military Demobilization, Bandit Suppression, Civil Administration, and Finance</p>
<p>Major Bandit Suppression War in Northern Fujian to be Launched Soon</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The new provincial government chairman Chen Yi and committee members Zheng Zhenwen, Chen Ticheng, Lin Zhiyuan, Li Shijia, and Xu Fu have arrived in the province. The committee members are scheduled to take office on the 5th. Wang Zhengting, the central government's supervisor, arrived in Fujian from Shanghai on the 2nd aboard the Hai Rong warship, expected to arrive on the 3rd. The seals of the provincial committee and various departments are also being brought by Wang. The government departments are all being taken over by the new appointees on the 3rd. The old personnel have all been dismissed and will be reappointed later. However, the repair costs for the provincial government and various departments were recently discussed and decided by the provincial committee, and a letter was sent to the finance commissioner's office requesting the allocation of 5,000 yuan for use. However, Xu Fu, citing insufficient income, has not yet allocated the funds after several days, so many necessary appliances have not been purchased. Moreover, many documents have been lost after the chaos. It is expected that they will not be able to start working immediately after the establishment without major replenishment and reorganization. The first priority of the new provincial government should be the post-disaster problems of the region. On the 2nd, provincial government chairman Chen Yi and Eastern Route Commander-in-Chief Chiang Ting-wen convened provincial government committee members Li Shijia, Lin Zhiyuan, Chen Ticheng, Zheng Zhenwen, and Xu Fu, as well as military commissioners Du Qiyun, Tan Shuqing, Song Yuanyuan, and Zhang Zhen, to discuss the demobilization of local troops, bandit suppression, civil administration reorganization, and financial unification. The discussions touched on all of these. It is heard that the content of the provincial government meeting mainly concerned the salary issues of the troops stationed in the province, which are all allocated by the central government. However, the local troops recruited by the various military commissioners are all being reorganized into provincial security teams, with a maximum limit of 10,000 men, divided into five brigades, with a security commander to oversee them. (The post of security commander has been appointed by the military commission to Xiao Qian, who will soon arrive in Fujian.) The salaries will be borne by the local government. Regarding the division of financial management in the province, local taxes will still be managed by the finance department, and national taxes will be managed by the finance commissioner's office.</p>
<p>The plan for suppressing the Red bandits in northern Fujian is still being undertaken by Eastern Route Commander-in-Chief Chiang Ting-wen. Currently, the Red bandits in northern Fujian are still entrenched in Shunchang, Jiangle, Sha County, and Yong'an counties, and have kidnapped Liu Qiming, the Sha County magistrate. They are also dividing their forces to spy on Youxi, Yanping, and Shaowu counties. They are currently in a stalemate with the divisions of Lu Xingbang, Liu Heding, and Zhou Zhiqun. Once the main force arrives, they will be able to encircle the bandit forces. Therefore, the large-scale bandit suppression war in northern Fujian is expected to begin soon. (February 3rd)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Rapid Progress of the Banking Industry</p>
<p>All Trades and Professions in Decline, Market Stagnant</p>
<p>Eight Banks Alone Reap Huge Profits</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Jiangxi is suffering from the national economic decline and the spread of banditry everywhere. All industries are in decline. Even in the case of commerce, due to rural bankruptcy and low social purchasing power, the market is stagnant and unbearable. However, the banking business is thriving. It is found that there are eight banks in this province. The branches from Shanghai are the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and the China &amp; South Sea Bank. The provincial banks are the Yumin Bank, the Construction Bank, and the Municipal Bank. There is also the Jiangxi Branch of the Farmers Bank of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Provinces, whose sole purpose is to provide relief to the rural areas affected by banditry. Among them, the Central Bank has the most developed business. Because Chairman Chiang was stationed in Jiangxi last year to supervise the suppression, the troops that directly or indirectly received salaries from the military headquarters numbered no less than fifty or sixty divisions. Each division was paid 150,000 yuan per month, totaling six or seven million. Most of this was remitted through the Central Bank. In addition, the military headquarters and various agencies' incoming and outgoing funds were entirely handled by this bank. The monthly business volume was around ten million yuan, and the annual volume was around one hundred million yuan. Therefore, the Central Bank's Jiangxi Branch made a profit of between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan last year. The Bank of China, in addition to government funds, surpassed the Central Bank in commercial terms. The Shanghai-Jiangxi exchange and local lending were dominated by this bank. Last year's profits were also over 100,000 yuan. The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank has seen its business grow daily since its establishment. Small and medium-sized merchants and retail depositors are happy to do business with it. In particular, the savings department absorbs the floating capital of the middle class. The turnover is quite flexible. The China &amp; South Sea Bank, due to its smaller size, has not been able to develop its business and is not worth mentioning. The Yumin Municipal Construction Bank all had surpluses in their business last year. The dividends were about 10,000 to 45,000 yuan. The Farmers Bank of the Four Provinces was established to provide relief to rural areas. It has now established warehouses for the consignment and mortgage of agricultural products and has lent small amounts of money to cooperatives in various places. Its business should be considered separately. According to people in the financial sector, the business of various banks has been thriving in recent years, which is in inverse proportion to the daily decline of various industries. Although there are many reasons, they do not go beyond the following: (1) Rural bankruptcy, financial capital is gradually concentrating in the cities, with banks being the final destination. (2) The middle and upper classes from other counties have abandoned their properties and brought their money to the province to take refuge, preferring to deposit it in large banks at low interest rates for the sake of stability. (3) Banks deposit funds at low interest rates and lend them to small and medium-sized merchants at high interest rates, earning a lot of profit on interest. (4) Due to the disappearance of export goods in this province, the financial system has lost its balance of circulation. Those who handle goods in Shanghai have no export goods to offset, so they buy drafts and banknotes from various banks. The income from the exchange rate is quite considerable, and the banknote price, except after December, is higher than the silver dollar. (5) Banks have relatively strong capital and can manipulate and control everything. However, the fact that various banks are making profits in the midst of the decline of all industries is probably an economically abnormal development and not a good phenomenon. (January 31st)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>One Hundred Yuan Forces a Person to Death</p>
<p>In recent times, rural areas have gone bankrupt. Even Suzhou, which is known as paradise, where villages were once well-fed and well-clothed, is now often unable to make ends meet. Tragic scenes have occurred repeatedly. Yesterday (the 5th), Shi Guoxing, a villager from Nanzhou Village, Weiting, 31 years old, with a wife and three children, the eldest being eight years old and the youngest only two years old, whose family was originally well-off, has been suffering losses due to the low grain prices over the years. This past spring, he entrusted Shi Heqing to guarantee a loan of one hundred yuan from the Yitai Rice Shop outside Loumen, using a farming boat as collateral. The loan was supposed to be repaid with eighty yuan in the summer and forty yuan in the winter. The latter payment had not yet been made, but Yitai continued to lend the boat for use. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 4th, Shi Guoxing followed eighty or so villagers to the city to load firewood. Yang Tai asked him about the repayment date, but Shi remained silent and left. Yesterday (the 5th) morning, it was suddenly discovered that Shi had hanged himself with the boat rope in front of Yitai's river pier. The local court was notified to come and inspect the body. At the same time, Yitai went to summon the deceased's family to the city to handle the aftermath. It is heard that more than ten rice shops in Suzhou, including those outside Kuatang and Loumen, and on North Street in the city, have loaned out a total of about three to four hundred thousand yuan to villagers as farming capital. This year, less than thirty or forty percent of the villagers have repaid on schedule. Now that this incident has occurred, the rice merchants are even more worried. This is also an important issue amid the sounds of the New Year's drums.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Jailer Suspended from Duty for Custodial Care</p>
<p>Jiang Mengxiong, the county government's jailer, was found to have been corrupt in his handling of prison administration. The Judicial Yuan and the High Court have repeatedly sent commissions to investigate. Shen Jiayi, commissioned by the Judicial Yuan, came to the county on the 17th of last month to investigate. Finding that Jiang was not only negligent but also suspected of malfeasance and crimes, he reported his findings to the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry immediately ordered the county government to suspend Jiang from duty and investigate him. The official document arrived on the 24th of the previous month. Former County Magistrate Feng was about to leave office and did not have time to deal with it. The new County Magistrate Xu Cixuan only took office on the 1st of this month. Lin Biao, President of the High Court, came to the county on the 3rd to reinvestigate. That day, Jailer Jiang went to Shanghai again to socialize and was not found. It is heard that after the investigation, President Lin took away certain account books from the prison. That evening, County Magistrate Xu ordered the First Section Chief Zhang Zhaoxi to temporarily serve concurrently as jailer. He went to take over on the 4th. Jailer Jiang returned from Shanghai and immediately handed over, and was placed under custody and investigation on suspicion of serious crimes. It is now known that the High Court has separately appointed Huang Ruyuan as the jailer of this county, and he will arrive in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Small Steamer Service Launched Between Chonggu and Baihe</p>
<p>Qingpu Dispatch: There has been no small steamer service between Baihejiang and Chonggu, which has been very inconvenient for travelers. Now, local resident Qian Jun has raised funds to purchase a small steamer to run between Chonggu and Baihe. The steamer passes through Zhangyan and cooperates with the Zhuan and Tongji companies, which run between Zhujiajiao and Anting. If travelers from Shanghai want to go to Chonggu or Zhangyan, they only need to take the Shanghai-Nanjing Express train to Anting at 9:00 AM or 12:15 PM every day, transfer to the two steamers, disembark at Baihejiang, and transfer to the newly opened Chong-Bai small steamer to arrive safely.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Cruel Husband Abuses Adopted Daughter-in-Law to Death</p>
<p>Yang Fuquan, a resident of Yu Lane, Yanqiao, Fifth District, married into the Feng family and changed his name to Feng Fuquan. His wife, Feng, had a son. Three years ago, they adopted the daughter of Feng Jinshi from Qingyang South Street, Jiangyin, as their daughter-in-law. However, Fuquan's wife was extremely shrewish and often abused the adopted daughter-in-law in every possible way, beating her mercilessly, causing her to be covered in bruises, with head injuries and bleeding. She eventually died from her injuries on the 1st of this month. Upon the adopted daughter-in-law's death, Fuquan and his wife secretly buried her that day and reported to Feng Jinshi the next day that she had died suddenly from a disease. Upon hearing the news, Jinshi was suspicious and investigated in the Yu Lane area, learning the truth. He was overwhelmed with grief and reported the situation to the 13th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the culprit be arrested and brought to justice. After Li's branch sent police to arrest Fuquan's wife, Feng, (Fuquan had already fled upon hearing the news), she was handed over to the County Public Security Bureau yesterday and transferred to the County Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Provincial Committee Investigates Wuxi-Shanghai Highway</h3>
<p>Since the construction department and the Shanghai Municipal Government actively planned the Wuxi-Shanghai highway, the section from Changshu eastward to Shanghai is now open to traffic. The road surface engineering for the section from Wuxi to Changshu has also been completed. As soon as the bridges, culverts, and road surface paving are completed, vehicles will be able to pass through. The scheduled time is expected to be in May or June. There is also the Wuxi-Yixing Provincial Highway, which the Jiangnan Automobile Company applied to the construction department to design and construct. The project has long been completed. The Wuxi Construction Bureau previously drew up engineering design drawings and cost budgets for the section from Huishan to Meiyuan and submitted them to the construction department for review and record. Now, Construction Department Director Shen believes that the route drawings are from a survey made twenty years ago, which is a relatively long time. There must have been more buildings on both sides of the villages and towns that it passes through. He should state this clearly and ordered the county to reinvestigate. He has sent the technician and head of the municipal administration section Wang Yanquan, who is also the county construction guidance engineer, to Wuxi to investigate the project from Wuxi to Changshu, and at the same time to investigate the projects on the Wuxi-Yixing and Wuxi-Jiangyin roads. He will stay for about five days.</p>
<h3>County Land Bureau Actively Prepares</h3>
<p>In order to actively prepare for the establishment of land bureaus in various counties, the provincial government sent Fu Xingeng to Wuxi to make plans and carry them out. After Fu arrived in Wuxi, he contacted County Magistrate Yan about everything and allocated part of the Bao Weituan office building for use as the land bureau's preparatory office. All the official documents handled by the Second Section concerning land have also been rushed to completion in order to transfer them to the land bureau for handling. Also, the district land survey team leader Zhou Houxi has completed the land survey work in various districts. However, the surveyors need to recalculate the area, draw up draft maps, compile land registers, and fill out notices before the resurvey can be implemented. He requested the county government to send two appropriate personnel to assist in the work yesterday.</p>
<h3>Distillery Defaults on Large Sum of Money, Causing Dispute</h3>
<p>The Dingfeng Grain Distillery under the Dashi Bridge was established with funds raised by local residents Tang Hanzhou and others. Recently, because Tang failed in his speculative business operations, he embezzled more than 20,000 yuan from the distillery, causing it to be unable to operate. It was closed in April last year. Subsequently, the creditors of the distillery elected representatives to add shares and continue the business. However, it still went bankrupt in the fall, losing 16,000 to 17,000 yuan. Afterwards, Tang sold the distillery's site and assets to a certain drug store for 1,500 yuan. The creditors learned of this and sent four representatives, including Zhu Jianqiu, to negotiate with Tang and retain the funds to be distributed publicly. Unexpectedly, the four representatives, believing that they also had more than 6,000 yuan in claims, refused to hand over the 1,500 yuan for distribution. The other creditors were panicked and went to Tang Hanzhou's house yesterday to negotiate. Because Tang avoided meeting them, they dragged Tang's wife, Zhuang, to the Public Security Bureau's First Sub-bureau. The sub-bureau stated that the matter concerned the judiciary and advised them to file a formal lawsuit with the court.</p>
<h3>Wu County</h3>
<p>Land Bureau Preparatory Officer Arrives in Changzhou</p>
<p>It is heard that the preparations for the land bureau in Wu County have been handled by the county magistrate since the tenure of former County Magistrate Zhang Pengzhu. Matters such as sending survey chart root class to the province for training, and surveying guidance lines have all been carried out step by step. Recently, the province believed that this work was becoming increasingly urgent and that sending a specialist was necessary to carry it out actively. Thus, Wang Weizu (from Jiangyin) was appointed as the preparatory officer of the Wujin Land Bureau. After being appointed, Wang arrived in Changzhou on the 5th to meet with County Magistrate Cai to discuss everything. He is scheduled to go to the county on the morning of the 6th to take over all preparatory matters.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Jiangpu County Magistrate Escorted to the Province</p>
<p>Jiangpu County Magistrate Shen Weicheng failed to remit provincial funds despite repeated orders from the provincial government. The provincial government telegraphed him to come to the province for talks, and he claimed that he was going to the countryside to supervise tax collection. Now, on the handwritten instructions of Commissioner Gu, personnel have been sent to Pu County to escort Shen to the province.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Huainan Salt Administration Begins to Move Northward</p>
<p>The Huainan Salt Transport Commissioner specially sent Shen Yintang to Yangzhou to receive the administrative files stored in the Huainan Transport Deputy Office, so that the Huainan salt administration would begin to merge with Huaibei. After Shen arrived in Yangzhou, in addition to receiving the files, the reporter stationed in Yangzhou visited him to inquire about how to handle the additional salt license donations that shipping merchants had to pay since the volume of shipping has been growing. Shen said that the transport office would of course find ways to strictly pursue them, so as not to cause any leaks or underpayments. He hoped to convey this to the public security, charity, education and other sectors in Dancheng. The reporter asked again that, after the promotion of shipping, how would the government assist the sailing industry in the Twelve Wharf? Shen said that sailing has not been completely abolished and that the workers and sailors in the Twelve Wharf have not been seriously affected by shipping. It is now heard that Shen has negotiated all matters in Yangzhou and will take the files north on the 6th or 7th. The administrative powers of the Huainan Transport Office will be limited to food merchants in the future.</p>
<h3>Twelve-Weir Salt Workers' Petition Causes Trouble</h3>
<p>Due to the increase of six additional quota tickets for the wheel transport of edible salt on the Hunan bank by the salt workers and the labor and management sides of Twelve-Weir, and the fact that Taihe, Hengji, and An two wheel companies are also lowering prices to attract business, the sailboat transport is severely impacted and its livelihood is endangered. Therefore, the Twelve-Weir Eighteen Gang Sailboat General Company elected directors Duan Zhizhou, Wu Songping, Xie Zhaojia, Zheng Xinru, Tang Yuefeng, Xie Zizhen, and more than 20 representatives, including Chen Zhensheng from the Salt Pu Workers' Union, to come to Yangzhou to petition all parties. After arriving in Yangzhou, Twelve-Weir received news that Anhui bank had added 400 quota tickets for wheel transport, and Hunan bank had added more than 30 quota tickets for transport. All the workers were extremely panic-stricken. They immediately went to the salt affairs inspection branch to petition. One person was stabbed to death and more than ten were injured by the bayonets of the tax police regiment. On the other hand, they telegraphed all the representatives in Yangzhou, saying that more than 3,000 salt workers were preparing to come to Yangzhou on the 6th to petition. At the same time, the Jiangdu County Government received the above news. Considering the importance of local public security during this winter defense period, it immediately sent the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, Lang Huizhang, to advise the representatives to proceed according to the proper procedure and not to come to Yangzhou for the time being. Therefore, the representatives telegraphed the salt workers of Twelve-Weir, etc., to postpone their arrival in Yangzhou. The representatives scheduled to petition Shen Yintang, the deputy of Yunfu at the Four Banks Public Office, who came to Yangzhou to receive the Yunfu file, and Taihe, Hengji, and An two wheel companies on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob and Injure a Person on the Road</h3>
<p>Zhu Jian, a bill collector from Dayuan Cloth Store on Jiaochang Street in Yangzhou City, went to the Leitang Bridge area in the western countryside at the end of last month to collect bills. Yesterday, he arrived at Dayi. Because he had already collected more than 300 yuan and was afraid that it would be inconvenient to carry the money far, he happened to meet a familiar rickshaw puller named Xiao Feng. So he asked Xiao Feng to deliver the money to the city this morning (the 4th). Unexpectedly, Xiao Feng was ambushed by three bandits on the road about eight miles from the city at Xiaomaoshan. In addition to robbing all the more than 300 yuan in cash and scattered items, Xiao Feng's head was cut with a knife on the spot. Xiao Feng struggled to stand up from the pool of blood and walked with difficulty. He arrived in the city with injuries at dusk and was admitted to Datong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Linpu Wheel Robbed by Pirates</p>
<p>The Linpu Wheel, which runs from Shipu to Sizhoutou, Xiangshan, was sailing back to Shipu from Xiezhentou, Sizhoutou yesterday when eleven pirates disguised themselves and boarded the ship. When the ship sailed to Hejingdu, the pirates began to rob. They first fought with the four escort police on the ship, resulting in one escort police officer being killed and one being injured. Two pirates were shot dead by the police, and one was injured. One passenger and one squad leader of the defense regiment were also killed by stray bullets. All the guns and ammunition of the escort police were robbed by the bandits. Five or six passengers on the ship, including Yang Bangcai, the manager of Shipu Yudanan Goods Store, Yan Xianlin, the owner of Longtai Nan Goods Store, and a young girl, were kidnapped by the bandits. The clothes and silver dollars carried by the passengers on the ship were all robbed. Then the pirates forced the helmsman to steer the ship towards the Fengyang sea. Later, at Chong'ao, Beian, the pirates took the stolen goods and hostages ashore. The total loss is about seven or eight thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Major Fire on Gongyuan Road</h3>
<p>Yutai Clothing Store at the southern end of Gongyuan Road (in front of Zaogulou) in Ningbo City suddenly caught fire at about 6:00 yesterday morning. Firefighters rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. It took an hour to put out the fire. Six stores, including Guangda Coal Store, Huichang Car Store, Maohe Exchange Store, Yuchangxiang Clothing Store, and Renhe Money Shop, were burned down, totaling eight buildings and a loss of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>

<h3>Financial Sector Investigates Shanghai Business Community</h3>
<p>Still Able to Barely Maintain</p>
<p>Rumors of Large-Scale Closures</p>
<p>Believed to Be Overstated</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that with the approach of the Lunar New Year, some businesses in Shanghai are facing closures due to financial difficulties. It is even said that dozens of large stores on Nanjing Road will close at this time. According to inquiries made by the Central News Agency reporter with the local financial sector yesterday morning, these rumors are exaggerated. The economic panic in recent years is not unique to China, nor is it limited to Shanghai. Financial and industrial sectors in various places routinely close their accounts every winter. Naturally, a very small number of stores may experience debt disputes or even close down due to financial reasons. This is common. During the Lunar New Year this year, such events will certainly occur in Shanghai. According to a survey by the financial sector, the economic panic in Shanghai's financial and business communities this Lunar New Year is slightly better than last year, and most businesses are able to barely maintain.</p>
<h3>China Merchants' Last Year's Operating</h3>
<p>Income of Eight Million Only Covers Expenses</p>
<p>Debt Interest of Two Million One Hundred Thousand Must Be Raised</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Jiang Shantan, Secretary of the State-Owned China Merchants Bureau, said that although the bureau's operating income increased by two million yuan compared to the previous year, totaling eight million yuan, the expenses were also about eight million yuan. Therefore, after offsetting the income and expenses, the interest on the debt of more than 20 million yuan, which is 2.1 million yuan per year, still needs to be raised and allocated. General Manager Liu had previously submitted a request to the ministry to allocate funds for clearing, which was resolved by the Executive Yuan and handed over to the National Economic Committee for planning. Although this case was mentioned during the third meeting of the Standing Committee held in Beijing, how it will be decided is still unknown. The China Merchants Bureau's income has increased after active reorganization, but the debt is too large, and all equipment needs to be repaired and expanded. Therefore, it can barely cover expenses and has no ability to expand. In addition, the four ocean-going vessels to be built in the UK have been determined to cost a total of 341,700 pounds sterling, which is much higher than the budget. Therefore, one river vessel will be reduced, and there is still a shortfall. The British Gengzi loan is at most 400,000 pounds. After deducting the construction cost of the ocean-going vessels, the remaining amount is less than 60,000 pounds. However, the material cost of each river vessel is also 40,000, so the shortfall is very large and a way must still be found to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Jinghu Line Adds</h3>

<h3>Japanese Rice Dumped in China</h3>
<p>Extremely Difficult in Practice</p>
<p>Chinese People Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that there were previous rumors in this city that a large amount of domestic rice was being shipped to the Northeast, and recently there have been rumors that Japan will ship a large amount of food to China to dump it. Because this matter is of great importance, the reporter specially inquired about the truth from various related parties. The information obtained is as follows:</p>
<p>News from Rice Merchants According to information obtained from food merchants, since the domestic bumper harvest the year before last, there has been a surplus of rice stored in the interior. Although the harvest last year was not as good as the year before last, the accumulated rice from previous years is not easy to sell at once, resulting in a sharp drop in rice prices, which has only been seen in recent years. The suffering of farmers is deep, and merchants also feel very distressed. In view of this, the government has levied import taxes on foreign rice. The dumping of foreign rice in the country over the years has been a major reason for the sharp drop in rice prices. Since the government began collecting foreign rice taxes, the import of foreign rice has indeed decreased. As for Japan shipping a large amount of rice to China for dumping in recent days, it is also an extremely difficult matter in practice. Chinese merchants also have no ability to sell Japanese rice on their behalf.</p>
<p>News from Authorities The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has also sent personnel to investigate the matter of selling domestic rice to the Northeast, but has not been able to confirm it so far. With the current sharp drop in domestic rice prices, in order to raise prices, in addition to paying attention to domestic rice regulation, efforts should also be made to sell rice abroad, so that rice prices may rise. As for the dumping of Japanese rice in China, because Japan is not a rice-producing country, and its domestic rice prices are usually higher than those in China, with the current sharp drop in Chinese rice prices, there is no profit to be made from dumping Japanese rice in China. However, the Japanese side may have other plans, and the Chinese government and rice merchants should pay attention to it in order to stabilize the rice market.</p>
<h3>Huang Xuchu</h3>
<p>Boards a Ship This Morning to Return South</p>
<p>According to Him</p>
<p>If the Bankruptcy of the Countryside Is Not Relieved</p>
<p>Then the City Will Inevitably Collapse</p>
<p>Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, came to Shanghai after attending the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Beijing. He contacted the banking and industrial sectors to solicit investment and support for the construction of Guangxi Province, and has already achieved considerable results. Therefore, he decided to board the President Jefferson of the Dala Company this morning, along with Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Provincial Industry and Commerce Bureau, and Secretary Chen Tingzhi, to leave Shanghai and transfer to Hong Kong, and then return to the province via Guangdong. The ship is scheduled to depart from the Dala Wharf in Pudong at 11:00. Huang and others will buy tickets and board the ship from the Xinkuan Wharf at around 8:00. Huang visited major factories in Shanghai for several days. Yesterday, he expressed his feelings after visiting the factories to a reporter from the Far East News Agency, saying that Shanghai is the industrial center of the country, with factories standing like forests and markets lined up, which is extremely prosperous in the city. At first, I didn't know about the bankruptcy of the countryside. I am thinking about how to relieve it. It is inevitable that the city is prosperous and the population is concentrated. Farmers flock to the city, and the countryside is even more bankrupt. If the countryside is bankrupt and not relieved, the more prosperous the city, the more the population will be, and it will inevitably be difficult to gain a foothold. If this continues, the city will inevitably collapse.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Immediately Transferred to Longhai Road to Return to Office</p>
<p>The Development of the Northwest Is Progressing Smoothly</p>
<p>The Economic Committee Decided to Send Experts to Investigate</p>
<p>Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, attended the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee this time, and separately visited Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei to discuss the development of the Northwest. The National Economic Committee's Third Standing Committee decided on the principle. Shao came to Shanghai the other day and repeatedly met with Song Ziwen to discuss implementation methods, and the result was satisfactory. Shao took the night train to Beijing last night. This reporter met Shao on the train yesterday and, according to him, the development of the Northwest has been discussed in detail with all parties. The National Economic Committee plans to set up an office in Xi'an, and within two weeks, the committee will send Chinese and foreign experts to Shaanxi to investigate and inspect, and then decide on the gradual implementation plan, roughly with transportation and water conservancy as the top priorities, followed by rural relief, etc. After arriving in Beijing, I will transfer to Longhai Road and return to my post, etc. It is heard that Shao has ordered a large number of industrial products and long-distance buses in Shanghai to be transported to Shaanxi Province for application.</p>
<h3>Silk Sales Gradually Picking Up, Prices Rising</h3>
<p>Silk Factories Are Preparing to Start Work</p>
<p>More than Ten Factories Have Resumed Work in Recent Days</p>
<p>Cars Will Be Started Successively After the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that there are a total of 108 single and double cocoon reeling factories in this city. Since the autumn of last year, due to the sharp drop in the silk market and sluggish sales, the factories have been unable to maintain operations, and almost all of them have stopped work. Now, silk sales in Europe and the United States are gradually picking up, and spring cocoons will also be on the market, so the silk factories will start work successively after the Lunar New Year. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Increase in Work Resumption</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, there are more than 50 single cocoon reeling factories and 5 double cocoon silk factories in the Chang'an Road area of Xinzha Bridge in Zhabei District, 17 single cocoon silk factories and 2 double cocoon silk factories in the Tiantong Road Xiangyan Bridge area of Hongkou District, 8 single cocoon silk factories in the Caojiadu area of the West Shanghai District, 5 single cocoon silk factories in the Route Albesert area of the Concession District, and 4 silk factories in the Dapuqiao Rihuigang area of the South Shanghai District. In total, there are 108 single and double cocoon silk factories in the city. More than 60 factories were operating in the spring and summer of last year. Since the autumn, due to the sharp drop in silk prices and sluggish sales, it has been difficult to maintain operations, so they have successively stopped work. Only three or four factories are barely operating. Now, silk sales are gradually picking up, and prices have also risen slightly, so Yongheng, Xiangsheng, Fulunheng in Hongkou District, and Yuanxin, Jiyu, Chuxin in Zhabei District, Jingwei in the Concession District, and Baotai in the South District have successively started work and resumed operations.</p>
<h3>Slight Increase in Silk Prices</h3>
<p>The white spun silk produced by the factories could be sold for more than 900 yuan per package in May and June last year. Yellow factory silk could also be sold for about 800 yuan, and Sichuan factory silk could be sold for more than 700 yuan. Since the autumn, the prices have gradually declined, and each package is only sold for about 500 yuan, so each package must lose more than 200 yuan. The factories had no choice but to deposit the produced goods in the bank. Now, European sales are gradually picking up, and silk prices have also increased slightly compared to before. The current highest-priced white factory silk can be sold for about 600 yuan per package, and other types of silk, such as Sichuan factory silk, can also be sold for more than 500 yuan, so the factories are quite optimistic about the future of silk sales and will gradually start work to maintain their business.</p>
<h3>Factory Preparations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dagong News Agency reporter visited people in the silk industry to inquire about the opening dates of the silk factories in this city. According to them, after silk sales have picked up, the factories in this city have prepared to start work successively. However, due to the approaching Lunar New Year recently, the money market is extremely tight, and it is inevitable that capital turnover is difficult. Therefore, after the New Year, the factories will start work one after another. However, the silk industry crisis is deep, and it is hoped that the Silk Industry Control Association will seek fundamental relief measures as soon as possible, so that China's only silk industry will not be on the verge of bankruptcy and have the hope of revitalization.</p>
<h3>Building a Sun Yat-sen Statue at the North Station</h3>

The meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Chen Jiliang Is Ill</h3>
<p>Comes to Shanghai by Warship for Medical Treatment</p>
<p>External Rumors Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Hai Rong Can Arrive Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Chen Jiliang, Naval Vice Minister and Commander of the First Fleet, led his warships straight to Fujian during the Fujian Incident and was stationed in Fuzhou. Now that Chen Yi and others, the chairmen of Fujian Province, have taken office, there are people in charge. He originally planned to return, but on the 2nd of this month, Chen suddenly fell ill, and his condition was severe, causing rumors of an assassination. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00, the reporter met Wang Shouting, the commander of the training team in charge of Shanghai and Hong Kong, and asked about the rumors. According to Wang, the assassination theory is completely unfounded. Commander Chen has already left Mawei by the Hai Rong warship at 11:00 noon today and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning. As for the details of his illness, Commander Chen went to command this time due to the Fujian Incident and had no time to rest, working too hard, which led to this illness. On the morning of the 2nd, Commander Chen suddenly felt unwell and had abnormal chest pain. At that time, Commander Chen was still living on the Chu Tai warship. On the 3rd, his body was even more tired, so he was transferred to the Nantai Bosheng Hospital. After diagnosis, he was considered to have pneumonia. On the 4th, it became more serious. Therefore, the captain of the Chu Tai warship reported to the naval department, and Minister Chen Shaokuan hired an airline plane from Chen Cheng, the naval medical advisor in this city, to fly to Fujian to examine Chen. This was on the 5th. Starting at 10:30 in the morning. In the afternoon, I got a reply from consultant Chen saying that Commander Chen does not have pneumonia, and that Commander Chen’s lungs and stomach are very good. It is inconvenient to get medical treatment on the warship. He originally intended to return to Shanghai, so he was instructed by the doctor to take the Hai Rong warship back to Shanghai. He will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning. After arriving in Shanghai, of course, he will need a long period of treatment. All kinds of external rumors are rumors.</p>
<h3>Qin Fen Comes to Shanghai to Visit Song</h3>
<p>The Economic Committee Is Preparing to Hold a Plenary Meeting</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the National Economic Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and visited Standing Committee member Song Ziwen. Yesterday morning, he went to the Economic Committee's Shanghai office on Avenue Joffre to discuss various matters of the committee with Deng Mianren and others. He left at 12:00 noon. The Economic Committee will hold its first plenary meeting in the near future. Qin came to Shanghai to consult Song Ziwen on the preparations for the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Water Level Is Decreasing Again</h3>
<p>Navigation Is More Difficult</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water level has suddenly decreased since January 15. The water level at Madang was 8 feet 9 inches. By the 5th, the Jianghan Customs lifted the ban on the new port to open the navigation route. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the water level receded again, and the river ships still had difficulty navigating. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Water at the New Port Receded Again</h3>
<p>When the Yangtze River is at its shallowest near Xiaogushan in Madang, it recedes to 8 feet 9 inches, and all Yangtze River ships are obstructed. Jianghan Customs closed the new port there and prohibited ships from traveling. Until the 5th of this month, after the Jianghan Customs measured the results, the water level at the new port in Madang was 10 feet 4 inches, which was larger than the old port. Ships with a draft of about 10 feet can pass through. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, various shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from Hankou saying that the new port in Madang had just been unblocked and opened for navigation, but the river water had receded again. Yesterday, it had dropped to 9 feet 8 inches, and larger ships could not transport goods. It is still necessary to use barges to drag the bottom to pass.</p>
<h3>Longping Also Reports Shallow Water</h3>
<p>The water level above Jiujiang is originally larger than the upstream. During the period of water reduction in Madang, the Yangtze River near Longping Dayanshan is often about 10 feet 5 inches. Unexpectedly, yesterday, Shanghai received a report that the water in Longping has suddenly dropped in the past two days, only 10 feet. Jianghan Customs has issued a notice restricting the transportation of goods by upstream river ships not exceeding 10 feet. Therefore, the Yangtze River ships of the six companies in this port can only load one-third of their capacity. If they transport a little more, they must use barges to transfer and unload, which is very troublesome.</p>
<h3>Stranded Ships Are Difficult to Escape Danger</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Changxing ship, which ran aground at the old port in Madang, has been there for a week. Repeated dragging has been ineffective and has not escaped the danger. Yesterday, the company connected two telegram reports, saying that the coal and food in the ship are complete and requested the company to quickly provide relief. Because the ship has no hope of being towed out of the shallow water, the ship is currently guarded by military police. As for the ships stranded on the Upper Yangtze River, news was received from Xindi yesterday that the water level is still only 5 feet, and most of the ships are trapped in the sand and mud, and it is difficult to rescue them for a while. Fortunately, imports and exports from the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been extremely scarce recently, and there is no large-scale cargo loading.</p>
<h3>Revision of the</h3>
<p>American Cotton Loan Contract</p>
<p>Since the cotton and wheat purchased by our government from the United States with loans began to be loaded last winter, one-third of the American wheat has arrived in full, and only one-sixteenth of the cotton has arrived. Now, because there are very few outlets for cotton, it is inconvenient to load and transport it to China. Compensation for warehouse rent has led to requests to the American authorities to amend the contract. The information obtained by the reporter is described as follows:</p>
<h3>Twelve American Wheat Ships Arrive</h3>
<p>Since December 18 last year, American wheat has been transported to China by Norton Lilley Co, entrusted by the China Merchants Bureau, one after another through Portland. In seven weeks, a total of twelve ships arrived (including the Hubble Rodney ship of 8,900 tons that arrived yesterday). In total, 93,772 tons have been transported, accounting for one-third of the total of 300,000 tons. Among these twelve ships, one ship carried 7,200 tons, which was unloaded to Nanjing and purchased by Yangzi Flour Mill. The remaining eleven ships were unloaded in Shanghai. The average selling price per ton is 70 yuan. The value of the wheat that has arrived is 6,564,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Has Not Been Shipped Yet</h3>
<p>It was agreed that part of the loan of American wheat would be flour, with an amount of 60,000 to 70,000 tons. Since the promulgation of the new tax, the Ministry of Finance has set the import tax at 3 yuan per dan for wheat and 75 yuan for wheat flour, equivalent to more than 1.9 yuan in national currency. According to the current flour price in Shanghai, each package sells for about 2.2 yuan. If American flour is imported, including tariffs, the cost will be at least 2.67 yuan. Because it does not match the market price, the loaned flour has not been telegraphed to start shipping. Only a small batch was brought in by the Milverdale ship last month. It has now been decided to continue shipping American wheat first, because the import cost per dan, including various expenses, is only 4.23 yuan, which is easier to sell. There are still 200,000 tons of goods that must be shipped within 140 days.</p>
<h3>Cotton Contract Amendment</h3>
<p>The total amount of loaned American cotton is 800,000 pieces, accounting for 400,000 tons, worth 40 million US dollars. According to the original loan contract, all of them must be shipped before June 30 this year. Since the first batch arrived on November 17 last year, only 50,000 pieces have been shipped to Shanghai so far, accounting for only one-sixteenth of the total. Our country advocates selling a batch and shipping a batch, and is unwilling to ship to Shanghai first and bear heavy warehouse rent and other expenses. Recently, because the outlets for domestic cotton are not smooth, and the contract period will expire in June, it will be difficult to sell them all within the limited time. Therefore, our country has decided to propose amendments to the American cotton loan contract to the American authorities, extending the deadline by half a year or several months to facilitate sales. At present, this matter has been requested to the American government, and it is heard that the United States has agreed and is discussing amending the contract.</p>
<h3>National Chamber of Commerce Telegraph Request</h3>
<p>National Government to Consider Reducing Match Tax</p>
<p>And Limit Time to Clear Existing Stock</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "To the esteemed Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry: Recently, we received a joint letter from Gao Songfu, representative of Shanghai Dahua Match Factory, Sun Runzhai, representative of the Shanguo China Match Factory, Xi Jianqing, representative of Nantong Tongsui Match Factory, Cai Keming, representative of Shanghai Huaming Match Factory, Xu Huisheng, representative of Ningbo Zhengda Match Factory, Bao Zhen, representative of Wenzhou Suichang Match Factory, Shao Xiushan, representative of Shanghai Daming Match Factory, and Xu Guangji and Wu Yihua, representatives of Linhuai Huai Shang Match Factory. The letter roughly stated: 'The match industry involves foreign merchants using machinery for manufacturing, while our country uses manual imitation. The labor costs and production differ by a ratio of one to fifteen. Recently, due to foreign merchants dumping goods and fierce competition among domestic companies, the supply exceeds demand, and prices have fallen from 40 yuan per case to below 30 yuan. Manufacturers are struggling to maintain operations and are in a precarious situation. This year, we suddenly received a notice from the Ministry of Finance that the unified match tax, originally 7.5 yuan per case, has been increased to 17.4 yuan. Upon hearing this, manufacturers felt like they had been struck by lightning. To levy a tax of 17.4 yuan on goods worth over 20 yuan per case is equivalent to a tax rate of 70%. This increased tax could originally be compensated for in the price of the goods, with manufacturers only bearing the responsibility of collecting and remitting the tax. However, the manufacturers are all undercapitalized and cannot cope with such a sudden increase in the tax amount. Moreover, before the tax increase, foreign merchants and large factories had tens of thousands of cases in stock. The market price cannot be averaged due to the tax increase. It will take at least five or six months for their inventory to be cleared. The manufacturers are unable to sustain operations and have been forced to request your association to forward our request to the central government, asking it to consider the difficulties faced by small factories and provide support by appropriately reducing the tax rate and setting a time limit for clearing existing inventory as a form of relief. We eagerly await your assistance.' The representatives were also allowed to present their case in person at the meeting. Upon approval, it was found that matches are daily necessities, and a tax rate of 70% will affect all the people. Furthermore, the uneven distribution of inventory among factories has led to uneven market prices, creating an opportunity for large factories to overwhelm small factories. Based on the information in the letter, we hereby telegraphically submit this matter to your esteemed Yuan and ministries for review and approval. We earnestly request that you approve a reduction in the tax and set a time limit for clearing existing inventory to provide relief. Respectfully, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, (Seal)."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Executive Yuan Again</h3>
<p>Requesting Release of Confiscated Local Sugar from Qinzhou and Lianzhou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, stating: "On the 5th of this month, we received a letter from Pang Songhui, a representative of the sugar merchants of Qinzhou and Lianzhou in Guangdong, stating: 'Various groups have risen up to provide relief, and our representatives have repeatedly described the plight of the sugar merchants and requested assistance from your association. They have also petitioned the relevant ministries and departments in Beijing. We are grateful that you have understood our difficulties and accommodated our requests. Everyone was eagerly awaiting the reversal of this unjust case and striving to resume business. However, before the government's protective measures could be implemented, the Jianghai Customs intensified its destruction of local sugar. On January 23rd of this year, our colleague Henghelong transported 92 bags of 'K' marked local white sugar from Beihai on the Hubei steamer, which were received by Fu Tianshen firm in Shanghai. They reported the sugar to the Beihai Customs for inspection. The sugar was produced by the Lunchang sugar workshop in Wulixu, Lingshan County, and was certified as purely local produce. However, upon re-inspection by the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai, it was claimed that the sugar had a polarization reading of 92.8 degrees and contained more than 50% foreign sugar, and should be confiscated. Upon hearing this, we were shocked and perplexed. The Central Industrial Testing Institute was ordered last month to test type C local sugar from Qionghai County's Shizilu, which had a polarization reading of 92 degrees, while type B local sugar reached 93 degrees. The local sugar from Qinzhou and Lianzhou is even better than that of Qiongyai. Now, the Jianghai Customs' test results show a reading of less than 93 degrees, yet they claim that it contains more than half foreign sugar. What is the basis for this claim? Since last September, our sugar merchants have suffered from fines and suspensions imposed by the Jianghai Customs, and have been unemployed for several months. Fortunately, the government has agreed to provide protection, and we are just starting to resume business when we are subjected to this even more violent destruction. What hope do we have for the future? We are compelled to earnestly request your association to provide assistance again and truthfully forward this matter to the relevant ministries and departments of the central government for immediate relief measures: (1) Order the Jianghai Customs to immediately release the local sugar in this case. If it is absolutely impossible, please retain it pending a public re-inspection and absolutely prohibit its sale at auction. (2) Send personnel to the sugar-producing areas of Qinzhou and Lianzhou for on-site inspection. If it is inconvenient to send personnel, please order the Qinzhou and Lianzhou Sugar Industry Guangyitang to collect samples of local sugar with public certification from local party and government agencies, mass organizations, and send them to Beijing for testing to establish standards for distinguishing foreign sugar, in order to reverse the previous erroneous handling of cases and ensure the safety of future transportation. We are in urgent need of assistance.' Upon receipt of this letter, we found that eight or nine cases of Guangdong's entrepot local sugar being accused by customs of being mixed with foreign sugar and being detained and punished have occurred. The duration has been seven or eight months, ranging from Qiongyai to Qinzhou and Lianzhou. Our association has repeatedly received letters from the representatives of the sugar merchants there, as well as from local chambers of commerce, and has repeatedly petitioned your Yuan and ministries to seek redress, but no resolution has been reached to date. According to the aforementioned, the sugar shipped from Beihai to Shanghai was certified as purely local sugar produced by the Lunchang sugar workshop in Wulixu, Lingshan County, but the Jianghai Customs again detained it, claiming it was mixed with foreign sugar and planning to confiscate it. It should be known that the value of foreign sugar is higher than that of local sugar, and there is no need to pay taxes on the entrepot of foreign sugar according to regulations. Sugar merchants would never mix foreign sugar into local sugar to increase the quantity,"</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>"and pay an additional entrepot tax. Our association has clearly stated this in previous telegrams and petitions. However, the Jianghai Customs officials continue their destructive actions, which will leave Guangdong's local sugar with no foothold and contradict the Ministry of Industry's announced plan to revitalize national sugar. Therefore, we respectfully submit this telegram to your esteemed Yuan and ministries for review and approval. We earnestly request that you consider the long-standing requests for relief made by our association and the two points raised by the sugar merchants this time, and provide remedies to alleviate the sugar merchants' plight. This would be the most fair and convenient solution. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully pleads."</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Instructs Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>All Salt to Be Weighed Using New Market Scales</p>
<p>And Verification of Reductions in Regular and Additional Taxes</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "According to the Municipal Government Instruction No. 8467, 'Regarding the Ministry of Finance's directive on the implementation of unified weights and measures, a general order has been issued to all salt-producing areas, starting from January 1st of this year, to uniformly use the new market scales for weighing salt, while the tax collection will remain at the old rate. Currently, according to the verification report of the General Inspection Office, merchants and citizens in various regions are accustomed to old habits and are hesitant about adopting the new market scales, etc. The promotion of the new system of weights and measures is a key policy of the central government, and the hesitancy of merchants and citizens will affect salt tax revenues. It is proposed that your Municipal Government instruct its subordinate agencies to provide assistance and encourage merchants and citizens to enthusiastically comply without delay, in order to benefit salt administration. This has been communicated by telegram and is hereby relayed for your information and strict compliance. Please also provide feedback.' Upon receiving this instruction, while processing it, we received Municipal Government Instruction No. 8474, which stated: 'Regarding the Ministry of Finance's Order No. 2022 on the implementation of the new system of weights and measures, a general order has been previously issued to the subordinate agencies to expedite preparations and implement it by a deadline. Currently, the salt affairs and tax agencies under the Ministry only use weighing instruments for inspecting and collecting goods, making preparation easier. Therefore, the new system should be adopted as early as possible to promote it. The date of January 1st, the 23rd year, is set as the date for the salt affairs and tax agencies to implement the new system of weights and measures. All goods subject to inspection and collection will be calculated using the new weighing instruments at that time to achieve uniformity. As for the tax amount to be collected, it will still be collected according to the legal tax rate, based on the market standard of jin and dan. Furthermore, in order to rectify salt administration and equalize the burden, all central regular and additional salt taxes and local surtaxes, totaling more than 10 yuan to 13 yuan per dan, have also been instructed by telegram to be reduced to 10 yuan starting from January 1st of the 23rd year. The central regular and additional taxes and local surtaxes will be reduced proportionally. Those below 10 yuan will be improved gradually after assessing the situation, so that the plan for equalizing taxes can be gradually realized. The salt affairs agencies have been instructed by telegram to comply, and it has been reported to the Executive Yuan, which issued a directive stating, "This case has been submitted to the 141st meeting of the Yuan and the resolution to approve the record has been passed." This has been communicated by telegram and is hereby forwarded for your information.' Upon receiving this instruction, we hereby instruct your association to take note. This instruction is hereby issued."</p>

<h3>After the Disaster in Hua County</h3>
<p>Organizing Immigration to Find Food Elsewhere</p>
<p>First Batch Set at 50,000 People to Be Moved to Counties Along the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>Xi Dejiong Returns to Shanghai After Inspection, Establishes Reception Center at Daokou</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the Yellow River flooded last autumn, causing a particularly severe disaster in Hua County, Henan Province. The flooded area reached more than 5,500 square miles, more than 14,000 people were drowned, and 300,000 people were affected by the disaster. Although the Disaster Relief Group of the National Government's Yellow River Disaster Relief Association and local disaster relief associations have provided relief, the funds were too small and the disaster was too severe, and the disaster victims have not yet settled down. Unexpectedly, during December of last year, ice floes surged and water receded in various places, but were re-submerged, and disaster victims were in the cold ice, and boats could not cross. Besides a small number of those rescued, there were many deaths and injuries. Liu Zhi, Chairman of Henan Province, Xi Dejiong, Director of the Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association, and Yang Zigong, Director of the Henan Disaster Survey Office, successively went to inspect and decided to immigrate out to find food elsewhere. Now, a reception center has been established at Daokou Station. Mr. Xi Dejiong returned to Shanghai a few days ago, and Mr. Yang Zigong is in Daokou Town, together with the Henan Disaster Relief Association and the North China Charity Federation, requesting to handle immigration matters. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Immigration Area</h3>
<p>The disaster area in Hua County, especially the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, was the most severe, with 473 villages flooded, and 140,000 disaster victims who could not survive without relief. The Henan Provincial Government decided to transfer disaster victims from Hua County to neighboring counties along the Pinghan Railway, from Zhangde (now Anyang) in the north to Yancheng in the south. Anyang, Tangyin, Lin County, Wu'an, She County, Ji County, Hui County, Jun County, Huojia, Xinxiang, Qinyang, Bo'ai, Jiyuan, Xiuwu, Yuanwu, Yangwu, Qi County, Yanjin, Zheng County, Mi County, Yu County, Xuchang, Yan County, Xinzheng, Lin Ying, Fugou, Yanling, Weishi, and Weichuan and other counties were designated as resettlement locations, with the number of people to be resettled allocated according to the size of the county: 1,000 to 2,000 people in large counties, 800 to 1,500 people in medium counties, and 500 to 1,000 people in small counties. The first phase is temporarily set at 50,000 people, and more will be transferred in the second phase depending on the situation.</p>
<h3>Resettlement Measures</h3>
<p>According to the measures set by the Henan Provincial Government, the transfer of disaster victims from Hua County to various counties is for the purpose of temporary food aid. Good lodging should be provided in each county. The county government, together with the local gentry, should allocate resettlement to various districts, villages, and towns, and supervise and protect them. The county magistrates should be responsible for resettlement and prevent people from starving to death or being displaced. Each county should provide disaster victims based on household size, with approximately 30 to 60 households required to support one disaster-stricken household. Temporarily, the county government gentry will allocate it according to the number of disaster victims and the local poverty and wealth. The period of food aid is temporarily set at half a year to one year, and at that time, the situation will be re-evaluated and sent back to the original origin, or if any of them can make a living on their own and are willing to go elsewhere, they will be allowed to go. The county government should cooperate with local agencies to organize a disaster victim supervision committee to be responsible for supervision and protection. The local people must not entice, abduct, sell, abuse, or antagonize them. Disaster victims must not coerce, cause trouble, incite, or conspire secretly. If either party violates the regulations, the county government will handle it impartially.</p>
<h3>En Route Provision</h3>
<p>When immigrating, from the date of assembly to the date of arrival, daily allowances shall be provided, with one jiao per day for adults and five fen per day for children (or converted to japonica rice). For the required trains on each route, the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association of the Government will request the Ministry of Railways to telegraph each railway bureau to approve the allocation of trains free of charge at each station for transportation. The Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association has received a reply from the Ministry of Railways a few days ago to proceed with the free transportation. Regarding immigration expenses, in addition to the 50,000 yuan already raised by the Henan Provincial Government, the North China Charity Federation donated 10,000 yuan, and the World Red Swastika Society donated 2,000 yuan, which were handed over to the Henan Travel Agency to send personnel to Hua County to handle the matter. However, the transfer of 50,000 people only accounts for one-sixth of the disaster victims, and the majority are still in dire straits. It is hoped that people from all over the world will do their best to rescue them.</p>
<h3>Free Transportation</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Association of the National Government issued a message yesterday that due to the large number of disaster victims in Hebei Province, three more porridge factories have been added in the areas where the disaster is most severe in Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming, each of which can accommodate more than 5,000 people. In addition, the association stated that there are still more than 300,000 disaster victims in Hua County, Yu Province, and that they are trapped in a watery land and are crying out for relief. The association has previously telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to find a way to transport disaster victims free of charge. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Ministry of Railways agreeing to transport them free of charge immediately. The association immediately telegraphed the Disaster Survey Office of Yu Province to quickly handle immigration to save the people in distress. In addition, the association has recently received a report that Ling Water in the disaster area of Hebei has suddenly increased and the ice flow is rapid. The most severely affected areas are the more than 50 villages of Yangsai Erlangmiao Kou, Cuizhai, Lei Dian Zhai Tuan of the fifth district, and Shitou Village. The lighter areas are the more than 50 villages of Jiu Ji of the second district and Zhi Village of the fifth district. After hearing the news, the local Disaster Survey Office immediately dispatched personnel to knock on the ice for relief and distribute steamed buns, and set up porridge factories separately to arrange the work in a very tense manner.</p>
<h3>Fujian Red Cross Telephones Request to Quickly Remit Donations</h3>
<p>Rescuing Many Wounded Soldiers Every Day</p>
<p>Huge Need for Funds, Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>The Fujian Fellowship Association received a telegram from the Fujian Red Cross Society stating, "To the Public Appraisal of the Fujian Fellowship Association: The correspondence and plans have been delivered. For several days, we have been rescuing wounded soldiers, reaching 400 people. The association set up temporary hospitals to treat them, and accommodated more than 1,300 wounded soldiers in three locations, provided meals, and buried more than 200 dead soldiers. The need for funds is huge, and it is difficult to maintain. At this time of year-end, if no measures are taken, they will be scattered in the city, which is no small problem. We have previously requested donations, but have not received a response. This matter concerns our hometown, and we sincerely request your utmost support. If the amount is certain, please remit it quickly. Hoping for a reply, the Fuzhou Red Cross Branch bows deeply."</p>
<h3>Sino-Foreign Relief Association News</h3>
<p>ShaanxiAccording to the Sino-Foreign Relief Association at 12 Renji Road, this port, Wu Jun, the president of the Shaanxi branch of the Western Association, arrived at the association the day before yesterday to personally describe the recent situation in the province. He said that the Shanghai Association is responsible for the second and fifth major branch canals of the Jinghui Canal. They have long been completed and are now only in the finishing stage of setting up gates and reinforcing bridges. The farmland irrigated by the Jing River, such as millet, beans, grains, and cotton, are all as high as the waist. Compared with those that have not benefited from the rain, they are only knee-high. The harvest in the last autumn was excellent and far beyond expectations, more than three or four times higher. The export of cotton is indeed higher than in any other year. The report also said that the western part of the province is higher in terrain, such as Xingping, Wugong, Qianxian, Fufeng, Qishan, and Fengxiang, which are not covered by the Jinghui Canal. Only a dozen wells can be drilled in each county, and each well can irrigate about 400 mu, and gradually promoted, with the goal of equitable distribution of benefits. Unfortunately, the land is high and the water is low, and each well must be drilled to a depth of 450 feet, resulting in work that is slightly difficult and slightly delayed.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>During the Jiangbei floods of the 20th year of the Republic of China, dozens of breaches occurred in the Yun Dyke, and the towns of Gaoyou and Shaobo were completely submerged, and the people sighed their fish. The association undertook the repairs, and the largest of them, Tangjun Tower, Qigong Temple, Miaoxiang Kou, Yuma Head, Thirty Mile Shop, Twenty Mile Shop, and Six Major Breaches, were built quickly due to time and economic reasons, and were completed last spring. Fortunately, the harvest last year was deeply dependent on the protection of the dam. However, the association has deep considerations, strengthens and seeks to strengthen, and strives to permanently eliminate disasters, so as to avoid repeating the tragedy. It has been discussed and decided to rebuild the stone works. A few days ago, Mr. Wang Shuxiang, Deputy Director of the Dyke Repair, came to Shanghai to report that all the cement, steel bars, yellow sand, stones and all kinds of miscellaneous materials required for this project are all specially sold cheaply by merchants who maintain public welfare, which is very gratifying. As for the construction, the progress is also quite smooth. During the busiest period, 4,000 to 5,000 workers were hired every day. Now, on average, there are more than 1,000 workers every day. It is also said that the reconstruction of the stone works was originally intended to block the traffic on the canal. In order to maintain the lives of boat owners, it had to be rebuilt over the dam, so the construction costs exceeded 10,000 yuan, but the benefits received by the boat owners were more than ten times that. At this time when the weather is cold and the ice is frozen, the work is inevitably slow, but it can be said with certainty that it can be hidden before the Peach Blossom Flood. According to this, once the dam is completed, the lives and property of 4 million people in the eight counties under the wrapping river and the neighboring Huaian and Jiangdu counties will be guaranteed, and Anlan will be celebrated forever.</p>
<h3>Huai'an</h3>
<p>The Fougong Dyke in the county was washed away by water the previous year, and it has been repaired by the association since last summer because it involves 8,000 acres of fertile land and the lives of 100,000 people. Because the local people know the righteousness and are willing to help with their efforts, according to the original estimate, there is still a surplus of several thousand yuan in foreign currency. It is reported that the association has decided to raise several thousand yuan more and dredge the Yongji River connected to the dam to discharge the flow and irrigate it.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin</h3>
<p>The Pu Hui Porridge Factory in the county suffered from severe funding shortages and was difficult to maintain this year due to the large number of refugees after the disaster. It is reported that the association has allocated 3,000 yuan and cotton clothes to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Public Concession</h3>
<p>Public Works for the Last Year</p>
<p>Private Buildings More Developed Than Last Year</p>
<p>Application for License Started 2778</p>
<p>The Director of Public Works, Happier, reported on his work last year: Private buildings were more developed than the previous year. The amount of construction for which licenses were issued in the district was estimated to be 25,324,100 taels, while in the previous year it was only 18,181,900 taels, an increase of 39 percent. In addition, the total amount of miscellaneous projects is about 1.195 million taels, and the application was filed</p>
<h3>Building Permit</h3>
<p>A total of 2,778 cases were filed (including 2,154 Chinese and 624 foreigners). The approved cases totaled 1,480 cases. The houses approved for construction include 3,545 Chinese-style houses, 257 Western-style houses, 13 Western-style apartments, 13 offices, 204 Western-style shops, 4 theaters, 27 factories, 20 warehouses, and 784 others. 263 permits were granted for sanitation construction. The busiest month for construction was July and August, with 479 sites under construction at the same time. The smallest was in February, with 342 sites. The old houses demolished in the district included 1,714 Chinese-style houses and 63 Western-style houses. Most of them were demolished and rebuilt. After deducting the demolitions and constructions, 1,831 Chinese-style houses were added this year.</p>
<h3>Violation Cases</h3>
<p>Due to violations of construction regulations, 906 cases have been given warnings by the Public Works Department. Therefore, inspections must be carried out at any time. In addition, there are as many as 1,105 cases of construction without permission for which warnings have been issued. In a certain area, there are 190 houses of the Hua family, which were not built long ago, and there are 100 places where additions have been made without permission. Adding wooden sheds on the sun deck is the most common offense. In one case, a family added three stories on top of a two-story kitchen, turning it into a five-story building. An even greater danger is the conversion of Chinese-style houses into factories, adding roofs to courtyards, piercing walls, and removing handrails, all of which can lead to danger. Regarding the steel bars used in construction, contractors tend to only consider the price and not the quality. It has been discovered that the load-bearing capacity of steel bars and concrete is insufficient. Therefore, the Public Works Department sincerely hopes that homeowners, designers, and engineers will cooperate with the department to avoid danger. Last year, the department's material testing laboratory conducted 1,267 tests on building materials for public buildings under the bureau, while private individuals only requested 352 tests, indicating that the public has not fully utilized this facility.</p>
<h3>Public Buildings</h3>
<p>Many large public buildings of the Public Works Department were completed last year, including the police station on Pingliang Road and the married Chinese police officers' residences, the Chinese police officers' residences on Baoding Road, the slaughterhouse and animal pens on Dixiwei Road, the nurses' home on Daxi Road, the Western children's school on Yuyuan Road, the Chinese children's middle school on Jingzhou Road, and the office, two prison cells, a hospital, and a residence for Indian guards at the Huade Road prison. In addition, the police station on Chengdu Road was completed and put into use in January 1934.</p>
<h3>Road Works</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department currently manages roads with a total length of 182 miles of various pavements. In 1933, repairing road surfaces due to the installation of underground pipelines, etc., covered a length of 5,281 miles, with an area of ​​over 110,000 square yards. To widen and extend the roads, 86 plots of land were acquired, totaling 34 mu, 8 fen, 3 li, and 4 hao, costing 820,725 taels.</p>
<h3>Bridges and Wharves</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department currently manages 77 bridges, including 8 steel bridges, 18 concrete bridges, and 51 wooden bridges. A new reinforced concrete bridge is currently being built on the Jiading Road Hongkou Creek, with a width of 51 feet. A similar bridge is being built on the Kulun Road Shajing Port, with a width of 41 feet. The deep-water wharf built on Qiwupu Road has been completed and put into use. The pier on Zhaofeng Road has been extended.</p>
<h3>Drainage Works</h3>
<p>Since the new drainage plan began to be implemented in 1921, a total of 65 miles of ditches have been built to date, with 25 miles of connecting branches, and 72 miles of rainwater sewers and branches. In the past year, 62 sewage pits were abolished, and 187 houses were connected to the drainage pipes. A total of 3,712,646 gallons of disinfectant are applied to sewage in ditches every day.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Work</h3>
<p>This year, a total of 299,399 tons of household waste were collected, of which 161,620 tons were handed over to contractors to be shipped out by small boats, 89,659 tons were sent to incinerators for incineration, and 50,120 tons were transported to the eastern and western districts to fill in depressions. This year, a total of 52,957 tons of road sweeping and ditch cleaning were carried out, and a total of 42,972,000 gallons of water were used for flushing and watering roads. The Binlang Road and Maohai Road incinerators worked day and night throughout the year. With accumulated experience, the amount of incineration has gradually increased. In the summer, when watermelons are abundant, the moisture content of garbage reaches 45%, making incineration extremely difficult, so 3% of fuel must be added. This is not necessary in autumn and winter. It is now quite effective to preheat the air entering the furnace.</p>
<h3>Other Undertakings</h3>
<p>The Pingqiao Stone Quarry managed by the Public Works Department produced more than 21,183 cubic meters of material last year. The cement factory produced 177,822 pieces. The foreign poor people's shelter accommodates a total of 210 people at any time, including 1 American, 2 Austrians, 1 Belgian, 1 Briton, 2 Danes, 2 Estonians, 4 French, 5 Germans, 1 Greek, 2 Italians, 6 Latvians, 24 Poles, 156 Russians, 1 Serbian, and 2 Spaniards.</p>
<h3>Yushang Group Huadong Fishing Company</h3>
<p>Preliminary plan to order fishing boats from the UK</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that fishermen, merchants, and shipping merchants Zhang Junyi, Chen Jingchun, Qian Yujia, Hou Chaohai, etc., in view of the encroachment of Japanese merchants on China's fishing industry, and to remedy this, specially initiated the organization of the Huadong Fishing Company, with a capital of 300,000 yuan. Two hand-operated fishing nets, Huadong No. 1 and Dong No. 2, have been purchased to start fishing, and two trawlers have been ordered from the United Kingdom. This is a preliminary plan.</p>
<h3>The Sedimentation of Suzhou Creek Has Been Cleared</h3>
<p>Inland Water Vessels Operate as Usual</p>
<p>All Cargo Ships Will Be Suspended Starting From the 9th</p>
<p>The inland river steamship bureaus of the city, such as Lao Gongmao, Tai Dong, and Xie Xing, which operate small cargo steamers to Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places, were previously blocked due to siltation in the area of Laozha Bridge, Sampan Factory Bridge, and Yidaikou of Suzhou Creek. The round trips of ships were appropriate because the end of the year was approaching, and various places were coming to Shanghai to purchase New Year's goods for the market. Therefore, it was very crowded, and when the tide receded, they were all stranded on the accumulated silt and could not travel. Although the water patrol team tried their best to resolve the passage, it was not enough to solve the urgent need. The various steamship bureaus changed the trips to Suzhou and Wuxi to transship goods through Waihuangpu, detouring through Minhang, etc., in order to facilitate freight transportation. At the same time, the inland river steamship companies jointly petitioned the city chamber of commerce to request the Dredging Bureau to find a way to dredge the river in order to reassure travelers. The Dredging Bureau has now sent several dredgers to work, and the river has gradually been dredged. However, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and most merchants have already closed their business, so freight transportation has also decreased in recent days. The previously silted sections can now be connected unimpeded, and the small inland river ships traveling to Suzhou and Wuxi have resumed operations from Wusong River, without having to detour through Waihuangpu. However, as the settlement period is approaching, the amount of freight has sharply decreased, and the shipowners of various cargo ships have to return home to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Therefore, starting from the 9th, all passenger and cargo ships from various places will be suspended until around the 29th, when they will resume sailing.</p>
<h3>Chinese Exhibits Representative at the Chicago Expo</h3>
<p>Zhou Guanhong and Others Have Returned Home Yesterday</p>
<p>Reporting the Process at Meiyuan</p>
<p>Fujian Lacquerware Won the First Prize</p>
<p>Zhou Guanhong and Zhang Yanglin, representatives of the Chicago Exposition Exhibit Association, made great efforts to arrange Chinese exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion after going to the United States last year, which was well received by the people of Chicago. It is now known that the Chicago Expo will continue to be held this year. Letters have been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry to continue to invite China to participate. The association has already telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to approve participation during the period. The resident director in Shanghai has also telegraphed Zhou Guanhong and Zhang Xianglin to return home to discuss all matters. The two gentlemen responded to the request of the directors and departed from the United States, returning home yesterday. Last night, the directors held a banquet for the two gentlemen at Meiyuan Restaurant.

<h3>Foch Road, Rue Amiral Courbet</h3>
<p>Tenants Demand Rent Reduction Dispute</p>
<p>Landlord Has Asked the Court to Attach</p>
<p>Tenants Provide Guarantee to Lift the Seizure</p>
<p>There are seventy or eighty houses on Foch Road, Rue Amiral Courbet, which is adjacent to the French Concession and the British Concession. The land was rented by Shen Shumei, the Chinese comprador of the French Water and Electricity Company, to build houses. The tenants held a meeting last month and publicly elected representatives to send a letter requesting the landlord to reduce the rent by 40%. The landlord initially ignored it. Later, the tenants organized the Rue Amiral Courbet Branch of the Second District and Third Branch of the Citizens' Association to actively carry out the rent reduction movement. They also invited Mr. Wang and Mr. Lu to negotiate a rent reduction with Shen Shumei in order to resolve the matter peacefully. As a result, the landlord only agreed to reduce the rent by five yuan per room and made the payment of arrears a condition of the exchange. The tenants then held a plenary session at the Second Special District City Federation to discuss the matter. After the mediator Lu Jingshi reported on the process, the whole body believed that the rent reduction of five yuan was far from the requested 40% and could not be accepted. It was decided to temporarily stop paying the rent and deposit 60% of the monthly rent in the bank for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, the landlord learned of this and specially hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to first provide a guarantee for the Xin Wanyuan Sauce Garden opened by Wang Nengzu, who served as the representative, and implemented the attachment. The Second Special District Court sent personnel to the premises yesterday afternoon, together with the litigation agent of the owner, to seal it up and recover the rent of 618 yuan. After receiving the news, the manager, Mr. Wang, immediately raised 618 yuan in cash, provided the court to lift the seizure, and also asked the tenant's agent lawyer, Chen Bingxing, to file a counterclaim with the court, claiming that the owner had damaged his business and demanded compensation for the loss. When the tenants heard the news, they became even more angry. In addition to continuing to carry out the rent reduction movement, they also organized a delegation, issued a declaration, and requested assistance from all walks of life to stop the landlord's illegal actions, so as not to affect the city's rent reduction movement.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau</h3>
<p>The Technical Assistant Fraud Case Was Investigated Yesterday</p>
<p>Recently, a business owner, Chen Jianji, built a house in Jinjiafang in this city. Because it hindered the route, the bureau ordered him to stop work. Then, the Public Works Bureau sued the business owner, saying that according to the Heji contractor, Cai Wenyi, a technical assistant of the Public Works Bureau, could guarantee the certificate and did not need to accept the concession. He had to pay a sports fee of 2,000 yuan. The business owner did not need to pay separately, and he would allocate it from the construction fee. The contractor paid 1,000 yuan first. When building the overpass, the bureau ordered the work to be stopped. The business owner went to Mr. Cai's (referring to Cai Wenyi) house on Luxiangyuan Road to inquire. According to Mr. Cai, someone in the bureau was making things difficult, and there was still 1,000 yuan left. Send it directly as soon as possible to avoid others taking the rebate. The bureau then asked the business owner to identify Cai's photo, and it was correct. Therefore, the bureau sent a letter to the police station in the first branch of the second district to send Cai Wenyi to the local court. After interrogation, he was sentenced to custody. Now, it is known that this case was ordered to be summoned by Prosecutor Ouyang Shu yesterday. The business owner's wife, Chen Jiang, Chen Lanbao, and the contractor, Feng Atao (represented by Feng's apprentice Wang Zhangsheng), Qu Bingyu, and others appeared in court to study. (This project was originally contracted by Feng, and then Feng subcontracted it to Qu Bingyu for construction, which was a five-room, three-story building.) In the afternoon, the witnesses reported one after another. After the order was studied one by one and Cai Wenyi, who was in custody, was interrogated for a long time, Cai was ordered to be sent back to custody.</p>
<h3>Theft at Tongtaichang Gunny Sack Store</h3>
<p>At about 7 o'clock the night before, three robbers suddenly came to the Tongtaichang gunny sack store at No. 22 Laobaidu Heng Street outside the Dadongmen in the South City. They pulled out their pistols and drove the people in the store to a corner, forbidding them to speak out. While flipping through the boxes and cabinets, they took all the cash and foreign money, 175 yuan, 10 yuan in small bills, two gold rings, and clothes stored in the boxes, and fled out the door with the loot.</p>

<h3>City Ferry</h3>
<p>Adding the Chuntong Line</p>
<p>Officially Opens Tomorrow</p>
<p>One Departure Every Seven Minutes</p>
<p>The City Ferry Chuntong Line, which is being planned by the City Public Utilities Bureau, is ready and has been scheduled to officially open on the 8th of this month. The planning process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Spring River Wharf's Terrain The Spring River Wharf is in a straight line with Nanjing Road, about 400 meters (about 1,300 feet) from the Bund, which is equal to the Bund of Nanjing Road to Henan Road's throwing field, and the land price is dozens of times different. The shape of the Huangpu River, from the Five Horse Central Bund to the Lihong Bridge in Hongkou, is a circle, and the Spring River Wharf is located in the center of the circle, and its radius with the major streets is almost equal. It is connected to Pudong Avenue in the east, and telephones and lights are fully equipped. The New Spring River Wharf Built by City Ferry in Pudong</p>
<p>Water can be organized soon, and the land price is extremely low. Since City Ferry built a wharf here, there have been land developers who have gone to collect land and prepare to build houses. After the City Ferry opens, it will only take three minutes to directly reach the Bund of Nanjing Road. In the future, those who serve in the Bund area will want to move to the area, and the house prices will be lower than in any area in Puxi. Its development can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>City Ferry Equipment The place is commonly known as Lujiazui. Puxi is shallow, and the cost of building the wharf is several times higher than that of other cross-river ferry wharves. The office building is located next to the wharf to facilitate nearby command and management. The floating wharf is all made of steel with steel roofs. The first-class cabin panels dismantled from the Changdu ferry are used around it, and there are cabin doors to avoid wind and rain. Those waiting for the ship are no different from being at home. Entry and exit are separate, and the ticketing and inspection procedures are simple. The ship uses the City Ferry's latest No. 16 to operate. From 5 am to 8 pm, there is one departure every seven minutes. The ferry fare is five copper coins per passenger between 5 am and 7 am, and between 5 pm and 7 pm, and eight copper coins at other times. It is stable, convenient, and cheap, and it is a shallow blessing for the citizens.</p>
<p>The People's Ferry Suspends Operation The original People's Ferry in the area has outdated equipment. It takes no less than twenty or thirty minutes to cross the river if there is a slight wind and wave. The danger is even more so. It should have been eliminated long ago. It is said that the ferry users have voluntarily closed down.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Ye Gongchuo Initiated</h3>
<p>A Memorial Service for Mr. Wu Chaoshu</p>
<p>All Directors of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center Joined</p>
<p>Yesterday, Letters Were Sent to Various Agencies and Public Organizations to Solicit Participation</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, said that Mr. Wu Chaoshu, a member of the Central Committee, unfortunately passed away in Guangdong on January 2 of this year. All walks of life have expressed their grief and mourning. Mr. Wu was a central figure in our party, and he made great contributions to the party and the country. When he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he negotiated effectively among the great powers, and was praised by all countries as a famous diplomat of our country. Now, initiated by Mr. Sun, a large-scale memorial service will be held in Shanghai to comfort the heroic spirit. In addition to all the directors of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center as initiators, Mr. Sun and Mr. Ye Gongchuo jointly signed letters yesterday to solicit participation from various agencies and public organizations to jointly prepare for the event. It is stipulated that the deadline for registration is the 25th of this month. At that time, those who join will be invited to discuss the memorial methods and determine the date.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning Yimiao</h3>
<p>A Big Fire on Yuyuan Road</p>
<p>A Total of Five Families Were Destroyed</p>
<p>The Arsonist Is Suspected and Has Been Detained</p>
<p>At about 7 o'clock yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 92 Yuyuan Road, Tianlong Toys Distribution Office, in Yimiao. The flames soared, piercing the roof. Upon hearing the news, the fire brigades from various districts drove pump trucks to the scene to connect water and put out the fire. At that time, the fire had spread to the neighbors on the left and right of the office, and the Xinguihuating Tea House on the third floor. For a time, thick smoke filled the air and the fire was blazing. After the firefighters tried their best to rescue, the fire was extinguished. In this battle, in addition to the two buildings of the office being reduced to ashes, the three buildings of the Shuangshengyong Bird Cage Shop at No. 90, the Shen Zhiji Reporter Decoration Shop at No. 96, and the Gu Shunxing Rice Wine Dumpling Shop at No. 98, as well as the two tea rooms of the Xinguihuating Tea House on the third floor, were all affected and almost completely burned down. When the fire was raging, Liu Yunfang, the director of the first branch of the first district, immediately led a large number of long police officers to the scene to suppress the fire and investigated that the toys, etc. in the office were of very low value and not many in number, so the loss was very small. However, the office had insurance of up to 10,000 yuan, which was highly suspicious. Therefore, Wei Guokun, the manager of the office from Zhenjiang, was taken back to the office to inquire about the cause of the fire.</p>
<h3>The MacGalli Giant Fraud Case</h3>
<p>The Looted Money Is Temporarily Stored in the Police Station</p>

Among them, in addition to a National Bank passbook worth 1,500 yuan, a Zhongnan Bank passbook worth 500 yuan, and a Shanghai Bank passbook worth 2,100 yuan, the rest were all cash. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Li Zhishan requested the First Special Criminal Court to dispose of the money. It is said that the above-mentioned money was either handed over by the defendant, sent by a related person, or found by the police. He presented a list of the money to the court. President Qian Hongye instructed that the money should be temporarily stored in the police station and disposed of together at the time of judgment.</p>

<p>Little Jinbao Was Shot to Death</p>
<p>The Four Murderers Dispersed After Shooting</p>
<p>The Police Station Detained Five Suspects, Male and Female</p>
<p>A man named Little Jinbao lived in a thatched shed at the intersection of Huiwen Road and Zhongxing Road in Zhabei. He had no wife and no proper job. He was only associated with a group of scoundrels. Recently, he served as an informant for the detective team, so his peers hated him to the bone. At about 4 am on the 4th of this month, Little Jinbao returned home from outside and was suddenly attacked by four gangsters who looked like workers. They broke into Little Jinbao's bedroom and shot him to death, and then dispersed. Afterwards, the police station of the second branch of the fifth district reported to the court to send someone to verify the coffin and enshroud it. The police station detained five men and women, including Wang Zhengbao, Liu Baoru, Zhu Zhusan, and women Zhang Hushi and Zhang Lishi, who lived in the thatched shed. According to Wang Zhengbao, he was 57 years old and from Tongzhou. Liu Baoru said he was 37 years old and from Jiangyin. Zhu Zhusan said he was 30 years old and from Jiangbei. They all lived by pulling rickshaws. Zhang Hushi and Zhang Lishi said that their husbands also lived by pulling rickshaws. They all did not know how Little Jinbao was shot to death. Yesterday, a document was prepared to transfer the group of people to the local court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Indian Held Up</h3>
<p>The Preliminary Trial Was Established and Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>On the afternoon of December 29 last year, an Indian man and a Chinese man, posing as telephone repairmen, broke into the house of Wang Gui on No. 8 Sandefang, Luban Road, French Concession. Then, they recruited four other Chinese men for help. They then changed their name to the police station and were ordered to search for morphine. They locked the thirteen people in the room into the bathroom and forced Wang Dushi to open all the boxes and cabinets. It was later found that the stolen jewelry and cash were worth about 6,000 yuan. Later, the French police learned that the Indian man's name was Da Foxin and immediately arrested him at his address and sent him to the British Consulate, accusing him of armed robbery. He was brought to trial in the Police Court the other day in the afternoon. Four witnesses appeared in court and testified about the defendant's actions at the time. The interrogator then read out the charges to the defendant. The defendant bowed his head and said nothing. Therefore, the interrogator declared that the preliminary trial was established and imprisoned the defendant to await the British Envoy's periodic trial and conviction.</p>
<h3>Three Tenants Stabbed Two Landlords to Death</h3>
<p>For Demanding Five Yuan Rent</p>
<p>Such a Bloody Case Actually Occurred</p>
<p>Rong Baosheng (also known as Lao San), a native of Menghe, was 46 years old. Rong's wife, Miao, was 37 years old. They lived at No. 94 Xizihua Road in Nanshi Jiumudi. Rong was in the mahogany business, and his income was only enough to make a living. Therefore, he rented out the pavilion to a man named Li Zhongxian, who agreed on a monthly rent of five yuan. However, Li was an unemployed rogue, so he often owed a month's rent. Rong repeatedly urged him to pay, but Rong was also struggling because of the end of the year, and it was difficult for him to delay any longer. Therefore, he urged him to pay more urgently, but Li always ignored him. At about 11 pm last night, Li returned home from outside and went to bed. Mr. and Mrs. Rong thought that the opportunity was rare, so they went to Li's room to sit and demand the money. In the language of both parties, conflict inevitably occurred. Li had actually harbored evil intentions for a long time, and when Rong Laosan was unprepared, he used a knife to cut Rong's vital parts. Rong was unable to resist and was stabbed immediately, dying on the spot. When Rong Miao was next to him, she saw that her husband was stabbed to death by Li and desperately fought with him. Therefore, the woman's arms and other places were also stabbed. The murderer, Li Zhongxian, saw that he had caused trouble and planned to abandon the knife and flee. Fortunately, the cohabitant heard Miao's cry for help and came to see. He quickly brought Li Zhongxian</p>
<p>was taken to the first branch of the second district together. Under interrogation, the murderer confessed to the crime without hesitation. He was ordered to be temporarily detained and then sent for legal action. An order was sent to the Baojia to report to the court for inspection this morning.</p>
<h3>Measures to Restrict Rickshaw Licensing</h3>
<p>Shanghai French Concession Board of Directors Issued a Notice:</p>
<p>For the purpose of notice, the Board is aware that the traffic in the Concession is congested, and therefore, the Board of Directors adopted the policy of restricting public rickshaw vehicles implemented by the Public Concession Works Bureau at the regular meetings on March 6 and December 22, 1933, and the number of vehicle licenses for 1933 and 1934 is limited to 17,000. (The Public Concession only issued 10,000 vehicle licenses) The number of vehicle licenses applied for in the past has never exceeded the above-mentioned quota as of January 1933. Only 16,610 licenses were taken in January 1933, 16,624 in February, 16,789 in March, 16,906 in April, 16,955 in May, 16,574 in June, 16,757 in July, 16,786 in August, 16,856 in September, and 16,996 in October. Later, the number of applications for licenses slightly exceeded the limit, and the restriction measures set by the Board began to take effect. It has been decided that only those who hold old licenses will be issued new licenses according to the number of old licenses they hold. This method of exchanging licenses is the only fair way to protect the rights of vehicle owners. According to this standard, all requests can be satisfied. In order to avoid any disputes, the Board has decided to implement the registration method of public rickshaw owners in January 1934 and issue temporary registration certificates. The vehicle owners who hold this certificate can come to the Board to exchange it for a new vehicle license in January. According to the regulations of the Board, all public rickshaw vehicle licenses are not allowed to be transferred. Vehicle owners must not lend, transfer, or sell their licenses. If the number of vehicles prepared by the vehicle owner is reduced, they should immediately report it to the Board. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3>Shanghai National Products Company</h3>
<p>The First Voice of the Women's National Products Year</p>
<p>Astonishing Statistics of Purchasing Power in January</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Hong Miao Temple on Nanjing Road, is the earliest established and most important stronghold for promoting national products on Nanjing Road. Its location is conveniently surrounded by strongholds for promoting foreign goods, which, according to common sense, makes competition difficult. The company, aware of this, specially established a design department in April of last year, appointing Mr. Ren Jinpin as the director. Mr. Ren, based on his "Operational Plan for Building National Products" written in 1930 and the principle of "Chinese People Buy National Products with Reason," carefully studied the various facts of the company and formulated a first plan for developing business. This plan began to be implemented on September 1st of last year, and a monthly standard total business target was set to observe the results of the plan, with a completion period of six months. It was found that from January to August of last year, the monthly business was lower than this standard by 14.66%. Since September, no month's business has failed to exceed the standard. Subsequently, due to the success of the first plan, the company prepared to trial a second plan from December of last year, which was earnestly implemented from January of this year. Before the implementation, it was jointly agreed with Mr. Lu Qisheng, the concurrent acting manager of the company, to aim to exceed the previously set standard by 150% in the monthly total business within six months as the goal of completing the second plan. Therefore, Mr. Lu and Mr. Ren invited the general manager, Mr. Qiu Zhihao, to gather all the staff on New Year's Eve last year, held a fun fair at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and encouraged all male and female staff to work hard to serve the Women's National Products Year with the slogan of promoting the Women's National Products Year. It is now known that the company's business in January of this year totaled more than 84.94% above the previously set standard, which is better than any month last year. According to common practice, this month was both the end of the lunar year and the weather was extremely cold, coupled with the economic impact of the war, the society showed a clear phenomenon of economic downturn, and various businesses were all facing a sharp decline due to the shrinking purchasing power. However, the company was uniquely able to create this abnormal achievement, which is enough to amaze people and shows the value of its efforts.</p>
<h3>Impersonation</h3>
<p>Negotiations regarding the name of Bingxun Shorthand</p>
<p>The Bingxun Shorthand School on Hainin Road in Shanghai, founded in 1927, has established a unique position in the academic world. Thanks to the inventor, Yang Bingxun, continuing to study diligently, his aspiration has finally been realized. Today, his students serve in various organizations in society, and the number of people writing to the school from various places for correspondence and face-to-face teaching is increasing daily. Unfortunately, the First Zhonghua Vocational Tutorial School in Shanghai thought that this practical new skill was a great opportunity. Without obtaining Mr. Yang's consent in advance, they included in their charter that the Bingxun shorthand method would be taught by experienced teachers to attract students. Mr. Yang believes that this kind of imitation is a lack of moral concept and is unreasonable. He has had serious negotiations with the school. It is now heard that the school has cancelled the subject and published an apology to Mr. Yang in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Kidnapper Liu Ziyu</h3>

Judge Qian questioned the defendant and ordered a postponement of the trial.</p>
<h3>Sentencing for Trademark Forgery</h3>
<p>Tang Lianji, a native of Ningbo living at No. 70 Xiangfen Lane in the Public Concession, who runs a broker business, took 28,000 counterfeit cardboard boxes with the trademark of the American merchant Every Ready Battery to the Zhenxin Printing Factory opened by Chen Honggao at No. 10 Xinle Lane, Puyang Bridge, in the French Concession for cutting on the 21st of last month.

<h3>Establishment of the Joint Association</h3>
<p>Factory Staff Bookkeeping Tutorial School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery National Products Factory Joint Association yesterday notified its member factories as follows: "Esteemed sirs, the progress of a business depends on the availability of suitable talents. Now that business is evolving and changing with each passing day due to the evolution of science, the need for talent is the most important issue for entrepreneurs. In particular, the various accounting aspects of factories are complicated. If there are no applicable talents, it is difficult to understand the detailed figures accurately. In terms of accounting, the standard of calculation is lost early, and all plans are bound to fail. In view of the fact that member factories must have the pain of someone unsuitable for the job or a job unsuitable for the person, this association decided at the 22nd meeting of the 7th Standing Committee today to establish a factory staff bookkeeping tutorial school in the association's premises (and hire personnel from the Lixin Certified Public Accountants Office to provide training). This will allow staff members to take advantage of the tutorial opportunity to add service functions, enhance the knowledge of individual staff members, and enrich the content and develop the business due to the application of staff members, so that both are suitable for common use and both can be announced. In order to give preferential treatment to members, the fees are halved. All the detailed measures are detailed in the constitution. The date of commencement is set for February 20. Reports will be started from now until the eighteenth of the month.</p>
<h3>Oil Cart Wharf Robbery Last Night</h3>
<p>Police Officer Shot and Captured a Thief</p>
<p>Recovered a Portion of the Original Loot</p>
<p>A Handgun Was Found in the Garbage Can</p>
<p>Yan Baolin, a native of Ningbo, is nearly seventy years old. He is married to Cai, who is forty-five years old, and has a daughter named Xia Xiang, who is sixteen years old. Yan works as an old clerk in the Changhe Pig Shop on Youche Road in the South City. His family lives at No. 22 Youche Road, and their life is still sustainable. For some reason, he was noticed by bandits. At about 7:30 last night, Yan happened to be out and had not returned home. Cai was taking care of chores at home when four bandits suddenly came, speaking in the Jiangbei accent. Each of them had a handgun. When they entered the door, they closed the main door tightly and forbade any noise. Cai was stunned and allowed them to search the house. Unexpectedly, when the bandits entered, Yan's young daughter, Xia Xiang, happened to be standing outside the door. She witnessed the bandits breaking in and knew they were robbers. She ran to report to Police Officer Zheng Chen of Post No. 20 nearby. Upon hearing the report, Officer Zheng blew his whistle frantically. Liu Xueqing of Post No. 18, Wang Jiyuan of Post No. 24, and off-duty police officers Zhang Yinian, Liu Shucheng, and Liu Shutang all rushed to help with the arrest. Just as the bandits were coming out after having looted enough, the police officers chased them desperately. Unfortunately, because the area was very dark, the five bandits took the opportunity to escape. Only one bandit in a gray striped cloth shirt was chased closely by the police officers. He went west along Youche Lane to Ping'an Street, then west to Meiji Lane in Xibuhama and reached the Youche Wharf. Then he turned back to Ping'an Street and entered Tangguan Lane. He was held by the hands of off-duty police officers Liu Shutang and Wang Luoyuan near the south end of Yuanxing Lane and a portion of the original loot was taken back. The bandit surrendered. When he was chased along the way, Officer Zheng fired six shots, and the bandit returned two shots. Officer Liu fired one shot, and the bandit returned one shot. When the bandit was taken to the station, he was interrogated by the chief of the station, and it was learned that his name was Li Xueshu, 29 years old, from [missing information], living in a small boat on Baidu Bridge. He admitted without hesitation that he had conspired to rob. When asked where the handgun was discarded, he hesitated. Just as the interrogation was in progress, the police chief had already found the handgun in a garbage can at the south end of Youche Wharf. There were still two bullets in the chamber. The gun was a 6-inch Brown Lymm-style gun with serial number 8881.9. Among the original stolen goods recovered were a green velvet shirt, 16 yuan in banknotes, a piece of blue floral cloth, a child's schoolbag, and a piece of ham. The owner identified them as correct. After the interrogation by Chief Yi, he ordered that the bandit be temporarily detained and reported to the General Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Unified Tax Clerk</h3>
<p>Deng Darong Admits to Embezzlement and Misappropriation</p>
<p>The Facts Are Now Clear, Debate Begins Yesterday</p>
<p>Verdict Announced in Court on the 9th</p>
<p>Deng Darong, a native of Guangdong, was working as a clerk in the audit section of the First Section of the Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau on Chengdu Road. He was discovered by the bureau chief, Wang Zongzhu, for forging seals and embezzling a large amount of tax money, and ordered a strict investigation. However, it was the end of the Western calendar year at that time, and Deng Darong asked for leave to return to his hometown. Later, he learned that Deng was coming to Shanghai on the Asia Queen ship. The ship arrived at the port on January 6, and he immediately sent someone to wait at the dock. When the ship arrived, Deng was arrested and temporarily detained in the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>The definite number of Deng's embezzlement has been reported in this newspaper. After Bureau Chief Wang Zongzhu's detailed verification with various parties in recent days, it was learned that Deng had fraudulently withdrawn tax money, amounting to a total of 84,321 yuan and 21 cents. He then sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that Deng Darong be transferred to the First Special District Court and sent to the detention center for custody. At the same time, he hired lawyer He Qingyun, along with evidence, to submit a statement to the First Special Court, accusing Deng Darong of violating Article 234 of the Criminal Law, forging the seal of Bureau Chief Wang Zongzhu, Article 363, fraudulently obtaining materials, and Article 366, breach of trust, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, a civil lawsuit was filed requesting a judgment to repay the embezzled tax money of 84,321 yuan and 21 cents. In the indictment, he recounted how the defendant used various means to design and fraudulently withdraw tax money, totaling more than 10,000 words. He also stated that he had found a stone seal with the seal script of the name "Zongzhu" privately engraved in the defendant's residence, as well as evidence such as the stub of the Central Bank's checkbook and a silver deposit book, and asked Deng strictly where the seals and other items came from. The defendant admitted that in April 1932, he privately engraved the bureau chief's name seal in advance because he needed money urgently at that time and planned to secretly withdraw tax money from the Central Bank. When filling out the check for the withdrawal, he secretly obtained the check receipt form in the checkbook and obtained a checkbook from the Central Bank</p>
<p>by deceiving them. He filled out two checks, used fake seals, and personally withdrew the tax money from the bank. After the defendant was arrested, he handed over 212 Shanghai banknotes and 750 Hong Kong banknotes, and it was found that the defendant had deposits of 13,001 yuan, 1 cent and 2 cents in the Shanghai, China, and Kenyee Banks under the name of Duaji, etc. However, it was feared that there was still concealment, and he should be ordered to confess truthfully, etc. The Special Court accepted the statement and summoned him from the detention center by Judge Liu Yugui to the Second Criminal Court at 2:30 yesterday afternoon. Because the plaintiff Wang Zongzhu did not arrive, his agent lawyer He Qingyun stood up and described the case in detail, and presented</p>
<p>various evidence, stating that the defendant's deposits in Kenyee Bank had not been withdrawn because they had not been through the court, so the court should order the bank not to allow others to withdraw these deposits. When questioned, the defendant Deng Darong stated that he entered the Unified Tax Bureau in May 1931 as a clerk in the audit section of the First Section, specializing in reviewing the tax money reported by various organs. All the money to be paid by various branches was collected by the local Central Bank on behalf of the Bureau, transferred to the Shanghai Head Office, and the bills were sent to the Unified Tax Bureau for my review. After the collection bills from various places were collected, I would fill out the checks, which would be signed and sealed by the bureau chief and sent to the Unified Tax Administration. He admitted without denial all the points of the plaintiff's accusation against the defendant for malpractice and</p>
<p>the amount of misappropriation. The fake seal of the bureau chief was privately engraved in Wangping Street in mid-April 1932 for a few cents. The checkbooks were also obtained by me from the bank in the name of the Unified Tax Bureau, totaling three books, two of which have been used. I filled out the amount of money, stamped it with the bureau chief's fake seal, and personally withdrew the money from the bank, etc. Judge Liu ruled that the facts of the case were clear and ordered the debate to begin, so the lawyers from both parties stood up and debated for a long time. The court ruled that the debate on the case was over, and the verdict would be announced on the 9th of this month, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>The Current Cigarette Tax Rates Are the Same for the Government and Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>A Request for Careful Reconsideration and Forwarding of Loss Claims</p>
<p>A Letter for Swift Governmental Improvement (Part 2) - Huang Ziping</p>
<p>The tax bureau's letter focused on three main points: (1) whether tax revenue is affected, (2) whether opinions within the industry are consistent, and (3) whether there are practical obstacles to implementation. I, Ziping, have discussed these points in detail and offer the following answers: (1) Whether tax revenue is affected: as mentioned before, the failure of the two-tier tax system lies in the tax reduction on high-grade cigarettes. Therefore, the revenue gained from increasing taxes on low-grade cigarettes must still compensate for the loss from reducing taxes on high-grade cigarettes. Although the burden on Chinese merchants is heavy, the government does not benefit, as British and American companies enjoy over 10 million yuan in annual tax reductions. If the idea of tax benefits for foreign interests is discarded, the tax rates on high and mid-grade cigarettes can be increased appropriately. Then, the benefits previously enjoyed annually by British and American companies due to tax reductions would be returned to the government, leading to an increase in tax revenue. How can it be said that tax revenue is affected? (2) Whether opinions within the industry are consistent: people's views differ as much as their faces. Complete consensus within the industry is practically impossible. To illustrate, many Chinese people do not support the establishment of Manchukuo, yet collaborators like Zheng Xiaoxu and Shi Yousan are also Chinese. The world cannot conclude from Zheng and Shi's collaboration that Chinese people are inconsistent and should recognize Manchukuo. Therefore, when discussing cigarette tax rates, one should only ask whether they align with the principles of fairness and whether they harm domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce, not whether industry opinions are consistent. If a tax rate aligns with fairness and does not harm domestic industries, it should be adopted; otherwise, it should be abolished. Industry consensus is not crucial. If consensus is required, the current two-tier tax system is already opposed by 24 Shanghai companies and the general public, with cigarette companies in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Henan provinces also protesting. It should have been abolished long ago. Therefore, this point does not require further discussion. (3) Whether there are practical obstacles to implementation: this likely considers the opposition of British and American companies. However, this is not a significant concern. Before the establishment of the National Government, customs duties were limited to a 5% ad valorem rate. After customs autonomy, this unequal treaty was broken. Consolidated taxes are domestic taxes, and even during the diplomatic failures of the late Qing Dynasty, domestic taxes were never interfered with by foreigners. China is a sovereign nation, and no matter how powerful foreign merchants are, they cannot interfere with domestic taxes. Even the agreements between the tax bureau and British and American companies only state that they should receive the same treatment as Chinese factories, with no preferential clauses. If a fair tax rate is set, applying an ad valorem tax consistently to both Chinese and foreign companies, there is no need to worry about foreign companies making excuses. The above points were thoroughly researched and discussed by Ziping and others, with unanimous agreement. As the tax bureau is currently seeking the opinions of cigarette merchants and the general assembly is studying tax rates, it is appropriate to prepare a written opinion and submit it to the general assembly. We hope for careful reconsideration and a reply to the tax bureau, striving to improve the tax rate as soon as possible, relieving the Chinese merchants of their plight. The industry would be deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to the general assembly of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association by Huang Ziping, representative of the People's Public Company.</p>
<p>Appendix: Original Letter from the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau to the Trade Association: We are writing to inform you that twenty-four cigarette companies, including the People's Public Company, have jointly submitted a petition stating that the current cigarette tax rates unfairly treat Chinese and foreign companies and request a prompt revision of the tax brackets for relief. Regarding the second-tier cigarette price, this bureau agreed to your association's request to raise the limit to 300 yuan to avoid restricting business. If the proposed tax bracket changes do not affect national tax revenue, if the entire industry agrees, and if there are no practical obstacles to implementation, this bureau will forward the request for instructions. Enclosed is a copy of the original petition for your reference. Please study it carefully, discuss it properly, and reply with your opinions. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A on Learning</p>
<h3>On Learning Languages (Part 2)</h3>
<p>From Mr. Cheng's letter, we believe there are two important points that need to be discussed with Mr. Cheng: First, should one read classical Chinese when learning the language? Second, can learning a language be effective solely through reading and studying texts?</p>
<p>Indeed, without language, we cannot express our own thoughts or understand those of others. However, the use of language is still just a tool—a tool for thought. Therefore, the purpose of learning a language is to make the use of the medium for communicating thoughts more flexible, which is what Mr. Cheng hopes for.</p>
<p>There is a difference between "language" and "writing." What is indispensable for the medium of communicating thoughts is not "writing" but "language," because there are many places where there is only "language" but no "writing," yet thought still exists. (See Chen Wangdao's "Some Questions About Literature" in the inaugural issue of Literature Magazine. However, Chen discusses the relationship between "language," "writing," and literature. We are extending his argument to generally discuss "thought.")</p>
<p>Writing emerged after language, but writing must be consistent with language. If it is not consistent, then such writing is definitely not a living language and is bound to be unintelligible. Because we usually think about things in the language we are familiar with, if we see a friend going somewhere and want to ask where they are going, the question that comes to mind is "Where are you going?" But if we are not asking verbally but using a letter—that is, writing—if we want to use "classical language" at this time, then we must translate this question into something like "Whither do you go?" From this, we can know that if "writing" and "language" are not consistent, then turning thought into writing must go through three steps: thought—the language of the time—the ancient language. This means that if we use classical Chinese, the communication of thought requires an extra step: we must translate the common language we think in into the ancient language, unable to directly write on paper the language we are thinking in. Those who are proficient in classical Chinese naturally do not need to go through such cumbersome procedures; they have learned the "ancient language" so well that they can think in the ancient language. But how much effort does their learning require! So, in the past, after learning everyday language, people did not just write but had to learn the ancient language as well. In reality, it seems like learning two languages. But if vernacular Chinese is used, this difficulty probably would not arise. Because what we want to say can be immediately written on paper. From a learning perspective, this is the first reason why we do not advocate reading classical Chinese.</p>
<p>Now, many people say that we certainly advocate using vernacular Chinese, but learning vernacular Chinese must start from reading classical Chinese. Don't you see that many people who write vernacular Chinese extremely well have a foundation in classical Chinese? This is a specious view. What are we learning when we learn classical Chinese now? Are we learning to write classical Chinese? Of course not. Are we gaining some writing skills from classical Chinese? This is also nonsense. Yao Nai believed that what one should learn from classical Chinese is nothing more than "structure, tone, spirit, reason, and taste." Are we now learning "structure and tone"? Since we are not writing classical Chinese, what is the use of learning this "structure and tone" that can only be applied to classical Chinese? Since modern grammar and structure are different from classical Chinese, what is the use of learning the tone of classical Chinese? There is also no need to learn the "spirit, reason, and taste" of classical Chinese. "Spirit, reason, and taste" are not exclusive to classical Chinese; our modern Chinese also has spirit, reason, and taste. Why insist on learning and studying them from classical Chinese? In short, the beautiful qualities of literature, such as what Yao Nai called vigor and tenderness, are what all articles should have. Classical Chinese has them, English also has them, French also has them. If we study with this purpose, then what is the difference between studying classical Chinese and studying French?</p>
<p>Another group of people, though not making the above argument, advises people to read ancient books and classical Chinese such as "Zhuangzi" and "Wen Xuan" to increase the vocabulary of beginners. This is also a prescription that does not fit the symptoms. Such arguments have been published extensively in this newspaper's "Free Discussions" section last year, and readers can refer to them for themselves to see the pros and cons. No need to repeat them. Now, let's point out the shortcomings of this argument. It is indeed necessary to expand the vocabulary of students at present, but not by looking in ancient books. In this respect, students should diligently consult dictionaries and use the living vocabulary in them. At the same time, foreign words, newly coined scientific terms, and terms that are trending in social life but have not yet "become established" should be added to expand the modern, living vocabulary. This is the real way out. The characters in Zhuangzi and Wen Xuan do have a lot that ordinary people do not recognize now, but even if these characters are recognized, what use are they in language and writing? Therefore, from the perspective of training writing skills, we also do not need to read classical Chinese, but only to be able to express my meaning as desired. Learning classical Chinese is absolutely unnecessary. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing regarding a news item in your newspaper's local news section on February 6th, reporting that the Jiangjing vessel of the Dada Company returned to Shanghai yesterday and (omitting the beginning) that the main perpetrators of the incident, Cai Yunsheng (from Wuling), Zou Caigao (from Yancheng), Zhang Yucun, and Liu Guangcheng, were handed over to the authorities and that a business card and main certificate of Wang Zemin, a shareholder in the Xiaobao District Nitratin Mine, were found on them. The Xiaobao Sub-Bureau's transport and sale of nitrate mines is limited to Xiaobao territory and does not extend to other areas. Zhang Yucun and his accomplices are suspected of being private nitrate traffickers who are using this method to avoid searches en route. The incident of smuggling and causing trouble not only harms the bureau's reputation but also violates laws and regulations. We are therefore writing this letter to clarify this matter, hoping that you will publish it in the letters to the editor column to clarify the truth and avoid confusion. Sincerely, Wang Zhixiang, Director of the Xiaobao Special District Nitrate Mine Sub-Bureau, February 6th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of Ms. Zheng Yu Jingxiu, who stated that she read the news report in your newspaper's local news section on February 6th about the lawsuit between the brother and wife of the deceased Zheng Mingshan. The report stated that the Rongyang Work Socks Factory was founded by the brothers Zheng Fengshan and Zheng Mingshan, which is not entirely accurate. Both factories were solely founded by the late Mingshan before changing ownership to a partnership. Zheng Fengshan was only given a portion of shares due to the late Mingshan’s brotherly affection. Therefore, we have been specifically commissioned to write this letter to request a correction to reflect these facts. We thank you sincerely for your assistance. Sincerely, Lawyers Chen Tingrui and Sun Zuji, February 6th.</p>

<h3>Protecting Children is Our Responsibility</h3>
<p>— Hu Chenzhou</p>
<p>That is truly good news for the children of China! Someone has proposed, "Protecting children is our responsibility!" Slogans that are colorful and green are plastered on the streets, walls and telegraph poles, and it has been decided that this year will be "Children's Year".</p>
<p>"Children's Year"! This reminds me of my childhood! I--no, not just me alone, but most of us--lived a dark, hungry, and dependent childhood. In those days, our lives belonged to our adults, and we were suppressed by them. Only a few children had stable, fulfilling and bright lives filled with love and games.</p>
<p>This phenomenon continues and continues::: until this year, which is "Children's Year"; "Protecting Children is Our Responsibility"! It will soon cease to exist (?). I think.</p>
<p>Our current task is to protect working children! Those in hereditary wealthy and educated families do not need our protection.</p>
<p>Protecting working children: abolish child labor (those girls working in the cotton mills who are scalded with hot water on their heads and bodies if they are slightly inattentive at work, so that large and small blisters rise up, and they are ordered not to cry! Those students in shops who are routinely subjected to torture by the shop owners: beatings, branding, ::: those eldest daughters in mansions who are often scolded and beaten:::). Strictly prohibit the sale of children (those evil traffickers who kidnap children from Shanghai, Ningbo, etc., and take them to Xiamen and Shantou to sell them to those with money! Here, whoever has the most maidservants is the richest! The situation is like the attitude of some capitalists towards their slaves after the abolition of slavery in the United States...:::::::). Relieving suffering children (those who pick up garbage all the time, summer or winter, sunny or rainy days, suffering from urban pallor,:::::)</p>
<h3>Seeking Happiness in Death and Showing Off in Death</h3>
<p>— Zhu Renyi</p>
<p>"Death" is always a bit terrifying to the living. However, strangely enough, some people are now seeking happiness at the head of the word "death". Perhaps all the joys of the world have been exhausted, but people are determined to find new and strange joys to be happy about, so they have found death. What an interesting farce this is!</p>
<p>The people of the twentieth century have also had enough of showing off, from the air to the sea, from the battlefield to the ballroom, from going abroad to going to the countryside, from revolution to chanting Buddha: finally, they have turned to the head of the word "death". It is also showing off to die. What another interesting farce!</p>
<p>Just open any major newspaper and you will always find news of death published. Here are two examples:</p>
<p>A young couple died together because they were not free to love. Their method was to draw two flower lines from the electric light to the bed, tying each to one leg, and then turning the machine button to electrocute themselves.</p>
<p>There was also a person who died by first buying a coffin, suspending it in the air, opening a hole at the bottom, and placing a coal stove on the ground, aiming at the hole, and burning coal; then he climbed into the coffin, moved the lid, and let the coal gas poison him to death.</p>
<p>This is looking for fun in death!</p>
<p>A certain monk studied abroad in a certain country when he was young and obtained a doctoral degree. After returning to China, he successively held important military and political positions. Later, after seeing through the world, he concentrated on cultivating and chanting scriptures; he will now die in the next month. So, he summoned countless believers.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman lost his love in the love scene, owed a huge debt, and could no longer maintain his life. He was determined to "die" in frustration, and wrote a letter of suicide note, the general idea being: the people of the country are willing to degenerate, the violent sun is invading, and they are not resisting. I cannot bear to witness the demise of the motherland, so I committed suicide in order to awaken my compatriots to rise up and save the country together. So, the newspaper touted it loudly, and everyone praised it!</p>
<p>This is called showing off in death!</p>
<p>The living want to seek the happiness of dying and show off the limelight of dying. This is far-sighted! Don't you see...</p>
<h3>The Voice of the City</h3>
<p>— Yixiao</p>
<p>Shanghai, a large city, always evokes in those who have never been there the illusion of a "great, mysterious den of consumption". As soon as you step into this metropolis of Shanghai, you will feel that it is hiding some sadness, depravity, pain, ... constant cries!</p>
<p>Sleeping in bed in the early morning, you will hear:</p>
<p>"Little cabbage... green vegetables, turnips..."</p>
<p>This sound is always sad and earnest: it will give you a burst of discomfort invisibly, and a moment later another burst:</p>
<p>"Shenbao, News, Times, Current Affairs News!</p>
<p>..." rough sound.</p>
<p>At noon, the sounds gradually become complex, sad and mournful: heavy and light: sandy and broken, boiling on the streets and alleys. The kind of life shouting, you really can't let your brain settle down for a moment, even if you walk on the street for a walk, those beggars, sick old beggars, will follow behind you:</p>
<p>"Sir, young master... do something good! ..." a burst of shouting. Is it a little quieter at night? Indeed, it is indeed a little quieter--but soon that kind of cry will move your heartstrings again in the quiet night alley:</p>
<p>"Olives... sandalwood olives, buy olives..." This sound is always clear, tactful, more natural than any music, and soon you hear:</p>
<p>Shell... The hissing sound made by breaking bamboo, followed by: "Be careful of fire! ..." short and quick sand sounds, from far to near, from near to far...</p>
<p>Late at night, I was awakened by a sound again, and I heard sparsely:</p>
<p>"Ham dumplings,..."</p>
<p>"Pork fat, rice, five-spice tea eggs..."</p>
<p>I have lived in Shanghai for ten years, and I always wake up sadly, sleep sadly, and wake up sadly in the middle of the night!</p>
<p>"The voice of the city, the voice of the city! ..." When will you disappear from my ears?</p>
<h3>Cleanliness and Squalor</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Recently, I met an old friend whom I hadn’t seen in years. During the height of our drunken conversation, he spoke at length about cleanliness and squalor, causing my face to flush with shame, because I am also Chinese.</p>
<p>My friend lives on a certain road in Hongkou, Shanghai. Besides the Chinese, there are also many Japanese among his neighbors. He told me, "If you want to know which house in this area is occupied by Chinese, you only need to look at whether there is a pile of garbage at the back door." This statement alone made me, as a Chinese person, feel quite uncomfortable. He continued, "If you take a stroll down a lane, you will see that the glass windows of many houses are covered in dust, as if the house has been empty for a long time; you can be sure that these households are also Chinese. Furthermore, you can also tell the nationality of the occupants from the gaps in the curtains or the lampshades."</p>
<p>Following this, my friend spoke about bathing, something he does every day. According to him, the women of a certain large commercial port in a province renowned as a land of culture and civilization do not bathe year after year; moreover, they dare not even wash their lower parts. Because if the act of washing the lower parts becomes known, the washer will be unjustly accused of "prostitution." Who would want to bear such a terrible reputation? Therefore, they have no choice but to let their lower parts become more and more squalid day by day. After my friend finished speaking, he repeatedly shook his head in disapproval.</p>
<p>He also told me, "A Westerner, after traveling all over East Asia, including Japan, Korea, and China, expressed his feelings to others, roughly saying: Westerners are clean both inside and out, Japanese are squalid on the outside but clean on the inside, Koreans are clean on the outside but squalid on the inside, but only the Chinese are squalid both inside and out." The terms "inside" and "outside" refer to the body and clothing, respectively. Being "squalid on the inside" is naturally related to bathing.</p>
<p>Finally, my friend said to me, "From cleanliness and squalor, one can see the national character of a country." After listening to these words, my face turned red, and I could only stare blankly and think.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24</p>
<p>Drinking and sharing food, wild revelry contains parting tears</p>
<p>Picking up the lamp to warm dreams, low singing passes the long night</p>
<p>Old Zhao stopped stroking his beard, puffed out his chest, and raised his voice, saying: "You've been a soldier for so long, how can you still be so sentimental? You know that these old bones of mine are very healthy. With me taking care of your mother-in-law and your wife, they will be even more comfortable than before. You don't need to worry about any of this, just go be a good company commander. Heroes are made of flesh and blood, and great things are also done by people, there are no immortals descending to help the people." At this point, he lowered his voice slightly and said: "Women's hearts are always soft, you have to put on an indifferent appearance to lift their spirits. If you yourself are so sad and gloomy, and they don't understand the things in the military camp, wouldn't they be even more anxious?" Zi Qiang smiled and said: "I'm not particularly anxious, it's just that I see that she seems to be very sad, and I don't know what to say to comfort her." Old Zhao said: "That's nonsense. When people are about to part, they are always sad. You should only use kind words to comfort her, saying that you will meet again soon, that's the right thing to do. If you are the same as her, wouldn't it be even harder to part?" These are just a few words from me, listen carefully and think about them." After Old Zhao finished speaking, he hurriedly returned to his own room, leaving Zi Qiang standing alone in the main room. He originally thought of going to the front yard to comfort his mother-in-law a few words. However, he didn't have that kind of courage, took a few steps forward, and then walked back again. He stood in the main room for a long time, afraid that his father would come out and lecture him, so he simply turned around and retreated into the bridal chamber. He sat alone on a chair, propping his head with his hands on the edge of the table. He sat there silently, not knowing how much time had passed, only hearing heavy footsteps as someone came in. He immediately straightened up and saw Gui Zhi walking into the room, smiling and skipping. Judging by her appearance, she was naturally extremely happy. (240)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Suzhou Tea Affairs</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuming</p>
<p>(1) Tea Production in China. The most famous tea-producing areas include "Lu'an" in Anhui and "Wuyi" in Fujian. However, people rarely notice that "Dongting East Mountain" and "West Mountain" in Suzhou also produce excellent teas, known as "Biluochun." "Dengwei Mountain" in Guangfu also produces the so-called "Benshan Yuqian." The annual output of these two types of tea is about six to seven hundred dan. "Biluochun" tea accounts for about six or seven tenths of this amount and is a famous tea. Locals pick it and sell it to tea merchants, and the price is only about seven or eight jiao per catty, which can be considered extremely cheap. After being roasted, it is brewed with clear spring water, and the fragrance is pure and lasting, unlike ordinary teas. According to the traditions of Lu Yu and Lu Tong's friends, the "Biluochun" tea produced in Suzhou is no less fragrant, pure, and mellow than the so-called "Shifeng" and "Tieguanyin" famous teas.</p>
<p>(2) Tea Merchants Because Suzhou produces tea, the tea industry naturally occupies an important position in Suzhou's commerce. According to statistics, there are more than forty large-scale "tea firms," "tea warehouses," and "tea shops" in Suzhou. Among them, the most historic and financially strong are "Wu Xunji," "Bao Derun," "Wu Shimei," "Wang Ruiyu," and "Chou Zhenlong." "Wu Xunji's" tea is mostly sold in Shandong Province, such as in "Jining" and "Jinan." "Bao Derun's" products are best-selling in "Yizhou" and other places. "Wang Ruiyu" has an affiliated tasting room and relies on publicity, so it can also dominate the tea industry in Suzhou. "Chou Zhenlong's" tea also has considerable influence in the Suzhou market. The annual turnover of the above tea merchants can exceed 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Scented Tea Suzhou's Tiger Hill, famous at home and abroad, has residents who mostly cultivate flowers and trees. "Citrus aurantium" is a specialty of the Tiger Hill scenic area. Citrus aurantium buds can be baked and used to make tea. If they are brewed with tea, they can enhance the flavor of the tea, making it rich and fragrant. Visitors who come to Tiger Hill know the great reputation of "Citrus aurantium tea." This kind of scented tea is sold to other places in large quantities every year, and Europeans and Americans especially like to buy it as a gift.</p>
<p>(4) Teahouses There are many teahouses in Suzhou. The more famous ones in the city include "Wu Yuan," "Pengying," "Sanwanchang," and "Wang Ruiyu." Outside the city, there are also "Changan" and "Fuan" teahouses. However, strangely, the tea drinkers have not been subjected to any formal restrictions, but they are very clearly divided automatically. For example, the customers of Wang Ruiyu's teahouse are mostly newspaper reporters and elementary school teachers. The customers of Wu Yuan's "Aizhu Ju" and "Huayu Lou" are mostly members of the Wu-area bourgeoisie. Outside the city, the "Fuan" and "Changan" teahouses attract merchants of all sizes and are veritable de facto exchanges in Suzhou that are divided into categories. In addition, the "East Pavilion" and "West Pavilion" of Suzhou Park are very prosperous in the hot summer months. Because the modern girls of Gusu have no dance halls or swimming pools to enjoy themselves, they often drink tea in the park to enjoy the cool breeze. A group of lecherous young men also often use drinking tea as a pretext to pursue their romantic endeavors. However, now that autumn has ended and winter has arrived, that group of customers has already changed course, and the "East Pavilion" and "West Pavilion" are hibernating like insects, waiting for the hot summer to come again to resume their activities. In addition, every year during the Lunar New Year, the Suzhou people who value auspiciousness like to go to "Changan" and "Fuan" in droves to drink tea. They believe that drinking "Changan" tea at the beginning of the year can bring lasting joy and peace, and going to Fuan Teahouse can bring blessings, health, and well-being. If the facts are as people wish, our government officials should also be invited to visit Suzhou's "Changan" and "Fuan" to taste the auspicious tea. Wouldn't that make our China prosperous and peaceful?</p>
<p>(5) Tea Talks There is a group of heroes who eat the sun during the day and eat the moon at night. They also learn from the politicians to establish factions and look down on all sides. If there are disputes, they are accustomed to using teahouses as places to comment on right and wrong. When they cannot reach an agreement, they may suddenly engage in hand-to-hand combat. This trend of "tea talks" is now rarely seen. Perhaps they have embraced pacifism and realized that they should no longer kill each other. As a result, the owners of Suzhou teahouses have reduced many unwarranted disasters!</p>

<p>Self-Funded Students Studying Abroad</p>
<p>Must Comply with Ministry Regulations</p>
<p>-Otherwise, Study Abroad Qualifications Will Not Be Recognized-</p>
<p>Students Studying in Japan Should Pay More Attention</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th) The Ministry of Education has issued an order to various departments stating: After reviewing the regulations, self-funded students studying abroad must have qualifications that meet the standards set by the Ministry's regulations for studying abroad, and their study abroad expenses must ensure their behavior. A study abroad certificate will be issued upon approval by the Ministry. After arriving in the country of study, the study abroad certificate must be submitted to the study abroad management agency in the country within two weeks for verification and registration. Recently, the Supervision Office for Students Studying in Japan reported that some self-funded students studying in Japan have gone abroad without a study abroad certificate, or have not registered with the office after obtaining a study abroad certificate. Recently, there have been cases where people have been detained upon arrival in Japan for lacking study abroad documents, or sent back to their country of origin by the original ship. This is detrimental to the national image. We sincerely request that measures be taken to prevent this situation. After investigation, it has been found that most of these students without study abroad certificates have either had their applications rejected by the Ministry due to unqualified qualifications or insufficient study abroad expenses, or intend to avoid the law and hope to obtain a study abroad certificate after going abroad. The Ministry has already strictly stipulated that the study abroad qualifications and academic qualifications of these students will not be recognized. Therefore, the Ministry hereby orders the department to earnestly guide the students in the affiliated schools who intend to study in Japan at their own expense, and ensure that they apply for a study abroad certificate before going abroad in accordance with the regulations, and register with the Supervision Office for Students Studying in Japan after going abroad, so as to respect the law and avoid abuses.</p>
<h3>Current State of Education in Hankou City</h3>
<p>A Total of 158 Public and Private Schools</p>
<p>Funding Is Extremely Difficult, and Existing Problems Need to Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Primary Education Is Underdeveloped, and 50,000 Children Are Out of School</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Education in Hankou City has always been underdeveloped. Illiteracy accounts for more than eight tenths of the total population. There are only 158 public and private schools in total, and funding is difficult, with many existing problems. Expansion and rectification are truly urgent. According to Mayor Wu Guozhen's public statement, the city's educational institutions are divided into middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens, vocational schools, public education centers, and public libraries based on level, and based on nature, they are divided into (1) Municipal: one male middle school, one female middle school, one vocational school, ten complete primary schools, fifty junior primary middle schools, one public education center, and one public library. (2) Semi-public and semi-private: nineteen schools for children of industrial and commercial workers. (3) Private: fourteen middle schools and sixty-two primary schools. The content is roughly as follows:</p>
<h3>Situation of Municipal Schools</h3>
<p>The situation of municipal schools is the most complicated. (1) There is the issue of factions. In the past, each school had factions, and it was not easy to replace principals and teachers, even if they were incompetent, otherwise it would cause a disturbance. After the city government decided to correct this situation, the principals and teachers of each school must first apply to the city government for registration. After registration, the qualifications review committee will review and determine whether they are eligible to be employed. However, the abuses of party affiliation and favoritism have not been completely eliminated. Later, it was stipulated that the principal has no power to completely replace teachers. If a teacher is incompetent, the city government must be requested to investigate, and the successor must still be selected from among those who are registered and qualified. This implicitly provides teachers with protection, and the abuse of control can be slightly reduced. (2) There is the issue of funding. After the provincial government vigorously reduced funding, the funding for municipal schools has not been in arrears. However, the arrears for the first, second, third, seventh, eighth, and ninth months of the 21st year are difficult to repay. The internal funding of each school has already been handled by the principal, who is like a bureaucrat. Each principal can obtain hundreds of yuan in extra income. The city government is now organizing a "Permanent Goods Accounting" and establishing a "Purchasing Committee" to implement public funding in order to eliminate this abuse. (3) There is the issue of school buildings. The school buildings are either borrowed or forcibly occupied, and most are not suitable, which has a great impact. The city government plans to issue 400,000 yuan in treasury bonds to provide sufficient funds for the construction of school buildings. It is estimated that each primary school student will be charged one yuan, each middle school student will be charged one yuan and five jiao, and kindergarten students will not be charged. The school building fund management committee will be in charge of managing the funds. This plan has been submitted to the provincial government for transfer to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Situation of Private Schools</h3>
<p>Although there are fourteen middle schools and sixty-two primary schools in private schools, most of them have simple equipment and unstable funding, and there are especially many with insufficient funds. Although the city government cannot supervise and improve teaching, it cannot solve the funding problem. It is now planned to provide some subsidies in the next semester, but it is unknown whether this can be realized.</p>
<h3>Situation of Industrial and Commercial Schools</h3>
<p>There are nineteen schools for children of industrial and commercial workers. The schools are run by the city government, and the funding is raised by industrial and commercial enterprises, so they are called semi-public and semi-private. The donors can form a "Funding Management Committee" and can also elect the principal. The managers are also not immune to the abuses of control or embezzlement. Now, a "Funding Supervision Office" has been established to formulate annual budget estimates and sort out the situation, which has been effective. The schools for children of the cart and ferry industries have all expanded their classes.</p>
<h3>Problem of Children Out of School</h3>
<p>In addition to the difficulty of funding and many existing problems, there is also a serious problem that has not been resolved for a long time, namely the problem of children out of school. At present, the city has more than 80,000 school-age children, but the existing public, private, and semi-public and semi-private schools can only accommodate 30,000 people. The remaining 50,000 children have no books to read. Even to enroll, each student must have a letter of recommendation from a military or political person, otherwise they will inevitably be turned away. Although it is ridiculous to view the school as an institution, it is also unavoidable. (February 2nd)</p>

The standards for students studying in Italy, the Philippines, and India are based on the annual expenses determined by each student. (3) The standard for converting foreign currency to national currency is calculated based on the average foreign exchange rate for the entire year of the 21st year in the National Government's statistical monthly report: 1 British pound is equivalent to 16.1 yuan in national currency, 1 Japanese yen is equivalent to 1.305 yuan in national currency, 1 US dollar is equivalent to 4.59 yuan in national currency, 1 French franc is equivalent to 0.18 yuan in national currency, 1 German New Mark is equivalent to 1.1 yuan in national currency, 1 Swiss franc is equivalent to 0.95 yuan in national currency, 1 Belgian franc is equivalent to 0.143 yuan in national currency, and 1 yuan in national currency is equivalent to 0.715 taels of regulated silver according to the Ministry of Finance's abolition of the tael and change to the yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiangning</h3>
<p>Development of Education in the Experimental County</p>
<p>Since Jiangning was changed to an autonomous experimental county, thanks to the hard work of County Magistrate Mei Siping and Education Section Chief Wang Guobin, the original 95 primary schools have been expanded to more than 195 primary schools in the county. It will not be long before more than 100 schools can be added, which is a new record in all counties in Jiangsu Province. It is said that the reason why it can develop so rapidly is that the county government authorities plan well, open the city and publicize it, cooperate with the county people, and encourage people in various townships to automatically set up township-run primary schools. The government provides appropriate guidance and subsidies, so many township-run primary schools have been established in the past six months. Local people are happy to support local education with local money. After the winter vacation, the county plans to promote more than ten primary schools, and six or seven schools have been added one after another. In order to popularize compulsory education, on the one hand, teachers are trained to meet the needs, and on the other hand, in order to seek advancement and meet the needs of modern rural society, Jiangning Primary School Teachers' Rotating Training Institute is opened to increase the necessary knowledge and skills about rural society. The staff, students, and school workers of the institute share the same hardships and develop the habit of diligence and hard work. The first and second phases of the institute enroll primary school teachers who are not currently employed in the institute for training (the first phase has just graduated, and the second phase is being recruited, and will start in March). After graduation, they will be sent to various schools to replace current teachers to make up the institute, and then rotate every three months to graduate, that is, continue to rotate, and all primary school teachers in the county can supplement their necessary knowledge and skills about rural society. The county feels that there is a lack of primary school teachers. In addition, a township-run primary school teacher training class is attached to the rotating training institute, enrolling 50 students, with a graduation period of six months. It is currently recruiting students and will start in March. The county provides subsidies to encourage primary schools in various districts and townships and to ensure that the primary schools in various townships have sufficient funds. The subsidy method is divided into five types (the maximum subsidy is 180 yuan per grade per year, and the minimum is 60 yuan), depending on the performance of the school and the amount of funds that the township itself can raise, as well as the grade of subsidies issued, etc.</p>

<h3>The First Class of Graduates of the Land Administration College</h3>
<p>Assigned to Various Central Agencies</p>
<p>The Central Political School, affiliated with the Land Administration College, has been operating since November of the 21st year. It immediately recruited the first class of 35 students, all of whom graduated from university and were admitted after a rigorous examination. During the study period, after undergoing screening, there were still 22 people who graduated in January of this year.

<h3>Former Northeast Education Association President Wang Huayi</h3>
<p>Talks About Education in the Northeast</p>
<p>Northeast Academy Now Changed to Northeast Middle School</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Zhang Xueliang Both Agreed to Subsidize</p>
<p>Wang Huayi, the former president of the Northeast Education Association, came to Shanghai from Peiping some time ago specifically because of the funding problem of the Northeast Middle School in Peiping to meet with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Zhang Xueliang, etc. and has had good results. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Wang at his residence yesterday, according to his conversation about the situation of education in the Northeast as follows:</p>
<h3>Students Entering the Pass</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, since the Northeast was lost after the September 18th Incident, at that time, I was the Chairman of the Shenyang Education Association. I then organized a diplomatic association dedicated to resisting Japan. This caused deep jealousy from the Japanese. On the day after September 18th, both associations were sealed off. I also temporarily took refuge in Peiping. Later, the Japanese ordered the closure of all secondary schools and above in the Northeast and prohibited them from opening, in order to implement their cultural aggression. All primary schools used the Japanese as their spiritual guide. Therefore, middle school students flocked to within the Pass. Initially, I first established a Northeast College in Peiping, which was later renamed Northeast Middle School. I submitted it to the Ministry of Education for record. Currently, there are over one thousand middle school students and about eight hundred primary school students.</p>
<h3>Implementing Military Affairs</h3>
<p>In terms of teaching, we try to avoid unimportant courses and completely eliminate courses such as drawing, crafts, and singing. We added military education. We take drills and shooting very seriously every day. Apart from this, we pay attention to chemistry, mathematics, industry, and other subjects. In the past two years, graduates applying for further education, such as when applying to the Central Military Academy, twenty-four were admitted, and the first place was a student from Northeast Middle School. Those who applied to universities such as Peking University were all admitted. Some who sought employment, several students who studied papermaking, have also taken positions in Peiping paper mills.</p>
<h3>School Funding</h3>
<p>As for school funding, initially, we only solicited clothing and food from all parties, but this was not a long-term solution. Therefore, before Deputy Commander Zhang (Xueliang) went abroad, I requested assistance from Zhang Shinan. Zhang was also very concerned and contributed private funds as school funding once. Later, when Minister Song (Ziwent) went to Rehe, I paid a visit to request a subsidy plan. Song immediately agreed to find a way to allocate funds. However, Song then went abroad, and the matter was shelved again. With the assistance of various parties, the central government allocated funds from financial institutions in North China once, but it was still far from enough. The middle and primary school sections need 20,000 yuan for the middle school section and 8,000 yuan for the primary school section. After Song returned to China, he promised to allocate funds according to the plan, but it was not fulfilled due to his resignation.</p>
<h3>Meeting Kong and Zhang</h3>
<p>This time I came to Shanghai, I have met with Minister Kong and Committee Member Zhang (Xueliang) successively. Both of them promised to find ways to allocate funds for Northeast Middle School. Minister Kong, in particular, is very familiar with the situation of our school and is especially concerned.</p>
<h3>Saving People's Hearts</h3>
<p>He continued that the Japanese are now in the Northeast, still busy with politics and military affairs, so they have no time to take care of education. According to those who have left the Northeast, they have now used Chinese traitors to form an editorial committee to revise all books published by Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, and The World Book Company within the Pass. All historical content is deleted, leaving only irrelevant content, while gradually adding Japanese history and geography. Therefore, it is predicted that there will be further actions in the future. However, my feeling is that those who are puppets of the Japanese in the Northeast are all from Jinzhou. The reason is that Jinzhou has been influenced by Japan for decades, leading them to recognize the enemy as their father. At the same time, the recent strategy of the Japanese is that political and military affairs may only oppress temporarily or intimidate only for a short time. Therefore, their new policy has changed to a plan of attacking hearts as the priority. Therefore, we deeply feel that if we want to recover our territory, our military strength is far behind. We can only devote our efforts to education, so that our compatriots in the Northeast will not forget their ancestors. Then, whether it is thirty or forty years later, there will eventually be a day of recovery. Otherwise, nothing is more tragic than the death of the heart, and we are truly terrified.</p>
<h3>China Educational Reconstruction Society</h3>
<p>Actively Implementing Productive Education</p>
<p>Co-operating with Huangdu Rural Teachers School to Run a Chicken Farm</p>
<p>And Preparing to Hold a Chicken Raising Work-Study Class</p>
<p>The China Educational Reconstruction Society is organized by Sun Kangzeng, Xi Yangzhi, Cheng Kuanzheng, Zhang Zhonghuan and others in the educational field, with the aim of promoting the production of education. Later, the Society felt that the Chinese countryside was increasingly bankrupt, so last year it co-operated with Huangdu Rural Teachers School to run Huangdu Chicken Farm, in order to improve rural sideline occupations and practice productive education. It has hundreds of laying hens, and everything is managed according to scientific methods. It also hired experts as technicians for the farm. Therefore, the chickens are all strong and lovely. The Society is now preparing to hold a chicken raising work-study class and test raising Chinese chickens, in order to promote the chicken raising industry in nearby rural areas and increase farmers' production.</p>
<h3>Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>Deadline for Reporting Teacher Changes</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Issued Instructions to All Schools Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued instructions to municipal primary and secondary schools yesterday, stating: "It has been found that the regulations for the appointment and dismissal of teachers in municipal secondary schools were revised and promulgated in September of the 22nd year and published in the 209th issue of the Education Weekly. The regulations for the appointment and dismissal of teachers in municipal primary schools were also revised in July of the 22nd year and stipulated the appointment procedures, which were also issued to all schools and published in the 200th issue of the Education Weekly. Now, it has been found that the second semester of the 22nd year has already started. Teachers in all schools should continue to serve according to the appointment period. Those who resign on their own or should be dismissed according to the regulations for appointment and dismissal must follow the prescribed procedures within two weeks after the start of the school year and submit them for approval.

<h3>School History</h3>
<p>Hunan University is the highest institution of higher learning in Hunan Province, with a long history. It was founded in the Song Dynasty, originally named Yuelu Academy, where Zhu Xi and others lectured. It was later renamed Hunan Higher Industrial School and Higher Industrial College, specializing in engineering. It was not until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China that it was renamed its current name, with the establishment of the two colleges of science and engineering. Later, in accordance with the university regulations of the Ministry of Education, the College of Liberal Arts was added. Currently, there are about 500 students. The school's facilities, such as the science hall and library, are quite complete, and the scale is also very grand.</p>
<h3>Contributions in Hunan</h3>
<p>Graduates from the school have made many contributions while serving in Hunan. For example, almost all the officials and staff of the Hunan Highway Bureau are graduates from the Department of Civil Engineering of the school. The completion of the Hunan-Guangdong, Hunan-Sichuan, Hunan-Hubei, Hunan-Jiangxi, and Tanbao highways in Hunan Province are all due to the achievements of the students of the school. In addition, Huang Jianbai, a graduate from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the school, is currently an engineer at the Hankou Jiji Water and Electricity Company. He has not studied abroad and recently invented a type of flying boat that can travel on both land and water, costing 200,000 yuan to build. Huang has already prepared one and is currently applying for registration with the government.</p>
<h3>China Children's Education Society Invited to Join</h3>
<p>International New Education Fellowship</p>
<p>The China Children's Education Society was invited to join the International New Education Fellowship, through the introduction of New Educationist Hua Xupeng from the United States. The Association had already sent letters to Chen Heqin and Dong Renjian to discuss everything. According to the Association, it was first organized in 1921 by new educators from various European countries, specifically to spread new ideas and methods of education and promote the implementation and improvement of general schools. Later, North America, South America, Japan, and other countries joined one after another, becoming an international organization for educational research. Figures such as Freinet of France, Kechstein of Germany, Decroly of Belgium, Montessori of Italy, and Dewey of the United States all participated. An annual meeting is held every year, and an annual report is published. Each member country also has its own journal. It is heard that the China Children's Education Society plans to make its Children's Education Monthly the educational journal of the Chinese branch of the Association.</p>
<p>The Raging Current Literary Society Initiates</p>
<p>The China Literary and Art Organizations Federation</p>
<p>Literary and Art Groups Across the Country Participate</p>
<p>Actively Proceeding with Establishment Soon</p>
<h3>Reasons for Initiation</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Raging Current Literary Society and many other famous literary and art groups in the country, in view of the lack of solid connections in the Chinese literary and art circles at the present stage, initiated the organization of the "China Literary and Art Organizations Federation" to unite literary and art groups across the country and jointly complete the Chinese new literary and art movement as its task. The association has been actively proceeding recently, and it is heard that literary and art groups from across the country, both domestic and overseas, as well as Nanyang and other places, have participated one after another and will soon be established, which will be a new phenomenon in the Chinese literary and art circles.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Association</h3>
<p>The declaration of the association is as follows: "The mission of literature and art is to reflect the times and also to promote the times. However, the Chinese new literary and art movement has been sluggish in its development for more than ten years due to the turmoil of the entire social situation, which has formed an undeniable fact. Therefore, the Chinese literary circles at the present stage still remain in a state of chaos - and all feudal and anti-era literature and art can still prolong their lives. It is undoubtedly necessary for the Chinese new literary and art movement to accelerate its progress in order to eliminate the survival of feudal literature that hinders the times and lay the foundation for Chinese new literature and art. In order to accelerate the advancement of our new literary and art movement, in order to unite the Chinese literary and art circles to jointly shoulder the mission of completing the promotion of literature and art, it is of course urgently necessary to use the power of groups to promote this great task. Therefore, the "China Literary and Art Organizations Federation" was produced in response to the needs of this objective condition. We believe that many scattered literary and art groups in China have different environments and form different tendencies. However, we need to complete the Chinese new literary and art movement, need to shoulder the mission of the times, and move towards the bright road. This is completely consistent. Therefore, we understand our mission and deeply feel that Chinese literary and art groups need to work together. We welcome literary and art groups across the country to participate together, and we also hope that the literary and art organizations federations of countries around the world will enthusiastically respond to us in order to complete this great mission."</p>
<h3>Recent Preparations</h3>
<p>It is heard that the initiating group of the association, the Raging Current Literary Society, etc., has once convened a preparatory meeting by the persons in charge, Sheng Maliang, Shen Runliu, Zhao Liu, etc., to jointly plan the progress and decided to use the three major alliances of literature, drama, and fine arts to promote the organization of the China Literary and Art Organizations Federation. Furthermore, recently, in addition to the literary and art organizations federations of various countries around the world expressing their willingness to cooperate, they welcome groups across the country related to literature, drama, fine arts, etc. to participate and cooperate in order to promote China's new literary and art movement. The general preparatory office of the association is temporarily located at No. 5 Penglai Lane, Zhonghua Road, Ximen, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>"Women's Home Economics" Bestseller</h3>

<h3>Tianjin Interport Football Team Tryout</h3>
<p>-- 5-1 Great Victory over Fu Jen Catholic University --</p>
<p>The Tianjin Team's Offense and Defense Are Excellent, Making Their Strength Fearsome</p>
<p>Although Fu Jen Lost, Their Goalkeeping Performance Was Very Good</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 4th Dispatch) The Fu Jen Catholic University football team from Peiping has given the citizens of Tianjin an excellent impression since arriving in Tianjin on New Year's Day and achieving consecutive victories. The Tianjin team, which will participate in the Tianjin-Shanghai Interport Games, is about to depart, and specially invited the Fu Jen team to Tianjin to perform, so as to learn from each other. The team of fifteen arrived in Tianjin the night before last to prepare for the battle. Before 3 pm yesterday, they first went to the English field to try out their legs and take photos in time, and then lined up to start the game.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Team Starts a Fierce Attack</h3>
<p>The Tianjin team attacked from north to south, and the ball entered Fu Jen's territory, but was kicked back by Li Fenglou. The Tianjin team's rear was repeatedly threatened, but fortunately, the first defense fought hard to turn the danger into safety. The Tianjin team took the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack. Jones' header in front of Fu Jen's goal failed. In an instant, Johnson's foot failed. Before long, the Tianjin team launched another attack. Johnson and Aicher successively showed their skills, but they were easily passed out by Fu Jen goalkeeper Wang Yumin. Jones went up again on the edge, kicking a shot. Wang Yumin rushed out to save and slapped the ball out of the defense. After two or three rounds, the Fu Jen defense was in danger again.</p>
<h3>Fu Jen's Goal Falls</h3>
<p>Johnson dribbled forward, and Fenjie and Swiss also became ambitious. The Fu Jen goalkeeper received the ball and broke through the siege, crossing the difficult pass. Wu Youan got the ball and dribbled forward to continue the attack. Tianjin's McElroy did not neglect his duty, intercepted the ball and passed it forward. Fenjie and Swiss passed to the center forward again, and Aicher took advantage of the situation to head it to the dangerous corner of the goal. In an instant, Jones rushed over like the wind, and the ball rolled towards the goal. The goalkeeper ran out to catch the ball, but unfortunately fell, and the ball steadily spun into the net, and the record began. Fu Jen kicked off, and the Tianjin team was in danger again. Wang Jingxi dribbled the ball straight up, but kicked it out of bounds in front of the goal, missing the opportunity again. Tianjin midfielder Sun Sijing saw an opportunity and took a long shot. The ball fell towards Fu Jen's goal. Wang Yumin hurriedly patted it into a corner kick, and the first half ended at the same time.</p>
<h3>Four More Goals Scored</h3>
<p>After lemon time, the Tianjin team entered a dangerous situation. Fu Jen lost many goals due to the disorganization of their troops. Tianjin's Malcolm showed his heading skills. Another corner kick was formed next to Fu Jen's goal. Jiang Lu took the penalty. Wang Yumin jumped up and missed. Johnson rushed up and kicked it in, winning another goal. Five minutes later, Jiang Lu cleverly intercepted the ball. Johnson chased the ball straight up. Wang Yumin rushed out to save, opening the defense wide, and the ball entered the net again. During the re-battle, the Tianjin team attacked fiercely, and Ai succeeded in hitting the goal twice. Wang Yumin was injured and left the field, replaced by Cai Binxian. Tang Guobiao received the ball and passed it forward. Zhang Zhizhen lost his sock meeting again. Jiang Lu met the ball and restrained it back. Ai rushed straight up and broke into the new goal with his body. Cai Binxian was unable to save in time, resulting in a score of four to zero.</p>
<h3>Fortunately Escaping Total Annihilation</h3>
<p>The center kicked off again, and Lian Yanxun hurriedly passed it to Wang Jingxi. Wang dribbled the ball straight up. The Tianjin goal was forty yards away and the kick was off again. The ball slipped out in front of the goal. In an instant, the Tianjin team launched another attack. Ai knew the opportunity and took a long shot. The ball touched the goal post. Cai Bingxian was too late to return to save, and the ball lightly rushed in. After re-kicking off, not long after the fierce battle, Wang Jingxi moved on the edge again. After getting the ball, he rushed up alone. In front of the enemy's goal, he lured the tiger away from the mountain, and the ball was lightly pushed into the hole. Twenty seconds later, the bloody battle ended. The Fu Jen army was fortunate to avoid being shut out with a score of one to five.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Team's Strength Is Impressive</h3>
<p>In yesterday's battle, Fu Jen Catholic University, as a university team, fought against the essence of the Tianjin team, which is currently occupied by Western players. Although their strength is somewhat inferior, it is still impressive. Fu Jen's lineup was not tidy. The forwards' attack and shooting were weak, and there were very few opportunities. The defense was a time of trouble. The three defenders and two guards were rarely flawed. Danger was rampant in front of the goal, and Wang Yumin's contribution was the greatest in turning danger into safety. With the assistance of Fu Niu and Yang Puzhi, the left and right assistants complemented each other, so that the Interport star Johnson was not satisfied. The ball rotating and rolling in front of the goal was indeed unexpected. It is said that it is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but difficult to guard against an arrow in the dark. Interport player Heil performed the best, his bald head looked like iron, and he coped with ease. The defenders Da Silva and Della were steady and shrewd. The forward Johnson did not succeed at first, but after a few rushes to shoot, he was indeed extraordinary. Aicher was experienced and cunning, and his passing and picking were unique. Although Jiang Lu ran fast, his passes were difficult to use. Sun Sijing's performance yesterday was not brilliant, but his steadiness is still that of an old Huang Zhong. In short, Fu Jen's problem this time was that there was no one to respond. The ball saved by the defense was not responded to by the forwards for attack, and it was intercepted by the Interport team, resulting in a lack of opportunities to knock on the door. If the forwards were full of strength and added fierce shooting, the situation would be renewed. The fourth and fifth goals were officially scored after the goalkeeper was injured and left the field, and the substitutes were inexperienced and could not avoid negligence. Moreover, Interport players Johnson and Aicher are veteran shooters. In addition, the school's right winger and left forward Ye Delu and Zhao Xitian were unable to play due to illness, and their strength was not reduced.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association</h3>
<p>Group A Is Not Worthy of Its Name</p>
<p>Three Games Last Night</p>
<p>Sea Dogs Defeat Gunners 73-24</p>
<p>Van Kings Defeat Jews 59-33</p>
<p>Macklings Defeat Datong 95-15</p>
<p>In this Shanghai Basketball Association, there were originally seventeen teams in Group A, divided into two divisions, one with nine teams and the other with eight. However, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Donghua in Division One have all withdrawn, leaving only six teams. Among the remaining fourteen teams, many teams are not worthy of their name. They are called Group A, but they are actually listed in Group B, and it is difficult to win the championship. Therefore, since the start of the competition, there have been few spectators, and the situation is very desolate, which seems even more deserted than the West Qing Basketball.</p>
<p>The strength of each team, the strong are too strong, the weak are too weak. Relatively speaking, among the teams in Group A Division One, the Sea Dogs are sure to take the first place. Although the Van Kings were defeated by the Sea Dogs, their skills are also remarkable. Compared with John in the West Qing Association, their progress cannot be measured. Macklings and Zhanghua in Group A Division Two each produced surprise soldiers and stood side by side. They will compete tomorrow night in the finals to compete for the championship of Division Two and win the right to compete in the finals with the champion of Division One, which is worth watching.</p>
<p>In the five games in Group A and B last night, the situation in the three Group A games was very different. The Sea Dogs defeated the Gunners as easy as turning their hands. The Van Kings defeated the Jews. In the first half, it was one-sided. In the second half, the Van Kings did not ask for much and used second-rate roles to fight, and the situation was more balanced. Macklings' victory over Datong was like playing in their hands. Datong had no chance to struggle. The results of the five games last night are as follows:</p>

<h3>Standing Committee of the North China Games Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th) The Preparatory Committee of the 18th North China Games, considering the large amount of cement and stone materials needed for the construction of the sports field and the considerable expense of telegrams to and from various provinces and cities, resolved during its regular meeting at the Provincial Government at noon on the 6th to separately request the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications to grant free transportation for cement, stone materials, and telegrams to and from them. In addition, it also passed important resolutions such as organizing the Hebei Province Training Committee for participation in the 18th North China Games and hiring temporary physical education inspectors and instructors.</p>
<h3>The Skill of a Master Is Indeed Extraordinary</h3>
<p>A Record of Smith's Performance on the First Day</p>
<p>▲ Cue Sports King Li Gongying is Energetic and Promising</p>
<p>▲ Today's Two Sessions Will Be Held at the Original Location</p>
<p>Willie Smith, the world-renowned professional cue sports master whom the Chinese and Western cue sports circles in Shanghai have been eagerly anticipating, demonstrated his skills at the United Chinese Association at No. 27 Beijing Road yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, with two sessions, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. More than two hundred spectators watched, and all were deeply impressed and amazed. Even Cue Sports King Li Gongying, in the face of such a formidable and unfathomable opponent, was able to bravely display his independent spirit, scoring 660 points in 40 shots, averaging 16.5 points per shot, a significant improvement over his previous performance. Today's two sessions will be held at the original location, the first session at 6:00 PM this afternoon, originally scheduled for Shen Lince. Mr. Shen is absent from Shanghai due to business, so Mr. Li will still take the stage. The second session will be at 9:15 PM this evening, and our country's rising star, Xu Shizhang, will take the stage to compete.</p>
<h3>Coming from Behind</h3>
<p>A total of three famous professional cue sports players have visited Shanghai: Faulkner, Gray, and this time Smith. Shanghai Cue Sports King Li Gongying is a student of Gray. It is conceivable that a famous teacher produces excellent students, and Gray's skills are excellent. However, according to those who have witnessed the skills of these three gentlemen, Smith's skills are even higher than the former. This is also a good phenomenon of progress in the professional cue sports world. Smith's past career has been mostly published in this newspaper yesterday and the day before, but there is still one thing that is worth supplementing. Smith once competed with Lindrum for the World Professional Championship, and they faced off five times. Smith lost by two to three, so the World Professional Championship is still in Lindrum's hands.</p>
<h3>An All-Around Master</h3>
<p>Smith has been proficient in this skill since he was a child, and he has been a professional in this field for 23 years. It is fitting that he is capable of all kinds of techniques on the six-pocket rectangular green table. His best skill is to attract the red ball and the opponent's ball to converge around the red ball spot, and then open, send the red, self-fall, and cycle endlessly, saving effort and being effective. After the two-person competition is over, the individual will make a special performance, like the after-show after the main drama. Techniques such as flying balls, circling, and hitting champagne baskets are novel and worth watching, and the methods of instructing how to hold the cue, hold the palm, and position the steps seem to be quite beneficial to newcomers.</p>
<h3>Course of the Competition</h3>
<p>The performance competition does not focus on winning or losing. Each person takes 40 shots. Smith scored 1950 points, and Li Gongying scored 660 points. Smith's last shot scored 333 points, which was the highest score of the day, followed by 276, 259, 181, 144, 130, 123, 106, averaging 48.7 points per shot. Li Gongying's large numbers were 100, 72, 42, 41, 30, etc., averaging 16.5 points per shot. However, Mr. Li missed a total of seven shots, while Smith missed as many as twelve times. This shows that Mr. Li's calmness is more evident.</p>

<h3>Major Financial Players Show Keen Interest in Buying</h3>
<p>Gold Prices Rebound Slightly by Five Yuan</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Department Reportedly Investigating Hoarded Silver, Leading to Weakness</p>
<p>Rumors of Impasse in Silver Price Manipulation Cause Firming</p>
<p>The gold market's situation yesterday was stable, initially weak and then firm, mainly because overseas communications were initially bad and then good. Major players showed strong interest in buying, initially driving hedging activities, coupled with the aggressive buying by speculators such as Mr. Lu, which stirred up the market. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US weakened, with forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange falling by 1 to 3.5 pence, showing a sense of weakness. Exchange rates fluctuated. London spot gold suddenly soared by 1 shilling and 9 pence. US cotton rose by 5 points, US wheat by half a point, and the opening of the wool market was flat, and market sentiment was not very firm, showing a slight downward trend. After the opening, a Reuters report that Treasury Department representatives were investigating the names and addresses of speculators hoarding silver to stop the ownership of silver held by banks caused weakness. However, with Sassoon parrying shillings and major players hedging, buying interest increased, rising above the 700 yuan mark, and then the gold market strengthened further due to tight domestic trading and a Reuters report that US Senator Pittman said there was no solution to silver prices. The noon session closed slightly flat. The afternoon market opened flat, and then rose briefly due to Kwong’s cover, but banks choked off sales, and the final result was still a盘, with a daily difference of ten yuan, resulting in a gain of four yuan and nine dimes. The spot price had risen to over 1,140 yuan. The daily market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 698 yuan and two dimes, a drop of one yuan and seven dimes from the previous close. Goods opened at eight yuan and one dime. Exchange rates opened with the near-term selling price of the British pound at 1 shilling, 4 pence and 375 mils, and the US dollar at 33 yuan and 625 mils. At the opening, the situation wavered due to banks choking off near扒遠, but Hengyu and Zhengchang were selling from time to time, and the Shanghai June US dollar was sold off at 25, falling from 8 yuan and three dimes to six yuan and a half. Foreign telegrams were unfavorable. Zhenxin扒 June US dollar at 3125, Daxing, Yongyuan, Chun, Hengyu, Wanxing, Fuchang and others bought together. HSBC's listing was announced, and the UK and the US did not move. At this time, it once rose to over 700 yuan, but it fell back to 698 yuan because Yuanmao, Yongheng and Xingyuan sold, and Mackellar choked off the May US dollar at 125. Sassoon 洋行 came to扒 shillings, and Fuchang, Dadecheng, Hengyu and others in the market bought hard from time to time, and then rose to over 700 yuan. Shanghai bought the May US dollar at 0625, Zhifeng and Yonglai entered, and then rose to 701 yuan. Shengda sold off, and then retreated to within 700 yuan. Zhifeng and Yongfeng sold again to within nine yuan. The news was more favorable after entering. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Dafa, Yongda, Xing, Yongzhengchang, Fuyu, Yuanda, Yonghuixiang, Hengxingyuan and others competed together, and then gradually rose to 705 yuan. Although Yida and Yongqingfa Yong entered after entering, it fell back to three yuan and three dimes because Yongfeng and Kwong sold shares, and Mitsui choked off the May US dollar at 875. Yuanmao, Yongyicheng, Dachangxiang entered slightly, and still struggled. Finally, it retreated to within three yuan because Dafa and Yonglai sold, and the banks still choked off.

<p>The afternoon market opened at 703 yuan and three dimes, and Ruikang entered shares, and then rose to four yuan. Yuanchun, Hengtai, Hongxing, Zhengchang and others offered shares one after another, and then fell to two yuan and one dime. Bingxing, Yida, Yonghengchang, Yonghengyu, Fuyu and others took the opportunity to enter at a low price, and the banks also扒. Mitsui扒 the May US dollar at 9375, and then rose to over five yuan. It was quiet at this time, and there were few transactions in the market. Later, Shengda suddenly came to cover, and then rose to six yuan and a half. Zhengjin came out with the May US dollar at 8125, and then 875 was difficult to sell. Mitsui HSBC choked off the April US dollar at 75, and Fuchang, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Fuyu and others sold one after another, falling to four yuan and one dime. Trading was still light after entering, and the situation in the market was stable. After hesitating, the closing was 704 yuan and eight dimes, and the goods were auctioned at four yuan and three dimes. Finally, it retreated to four yuan because Shunli and others sold slightly. The highest price of the day was 706 yuan and a half, and the lowest price was 696 yuan and a half, with a difference of ten yuan. As a result, it rebounded four yuan and nine dimes compared with the previous closing.</p>

In summary, Hengxingyuan, Dafa, Yongda, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Hengyu, Taihuixiang, Yicheng, Hongxing, Jingsheng, Yongruikang, Shenkang, Daxing, Yong and others were on the buying side, and Shunli, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Yifengyong, Yuanmao, Yong, Ruixing, Sida, Yongde, Yuanchun, Futaiheng, Bingxing and others were on the selling side.

<h3>Jiangjiao's Rise and Fall Was Very Rapid</h3>

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Lack the Strength to Rise</h3>
<p>All Prices Are Already at Their Peak</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, as the end of the year approached, the short forces' barrier gradually wavered, and the exchange and settlement transactions surged slightly, and the market price saw a strong rise. This was a reaction to the many days of hovering, seemingly not falling and seemingly not rising. Most people believed that shorting at this high market price was relatively less dangerous, but although there were many shorts, the bulls were very stable. After holding on for a long time, the shorts failed again. At the opening in the morning, covering suddenly rose, and No. 5 and No. 50 were bought quite a bit. No. 20 and No. 21 also had needs. The shorts on No. 75 also had exchanges, and the bond markets all rose sharply, gaining 1 to 2 jiao to 5 to 6 jiao. In the second round, there was still covering, and the disarmament surged 5 jiao, seeing a new high price of 69 yuan and 2 jiao. The other types also generally continued to rise slightly. The salt tax saw a new high price of 52 yuan, which was in line with the reporter's prediction. At the opening in the afternoon, some of the floating bulls came out, falling back by 1 to 3 jiao and a half. The closing prices were also mostly down by 1 to 2 jiao. This is the cause and effect of sudden rises and falls, and also the cycle of not being stupid and escaping. Because the market price still has the possibility of continuing to rise, it is actually already at its peak, and the strength to rise is more difficult than the rise from a lower price. Therefore, at this time, a rise of a slightly large amount will inevitably have a return of the wind, but it is not a fall immediately. The market price ultimately continued to rise by 1 to 2 jiao to 7 to 8 jiao. The total number of transactions was 15,768,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods, and 5,930,000 in futures, of which the unified salt tax accounted for 5,930,000, disarmament accounted for 2,020,000, 19 Guan tax accounted for 1,425,000, 20 rolls and 20 Guan accounted for 2,580,000, and Financial Zheng 6 accounted for 2,220,000. 96 also had over 1 million, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 200,000 to 300,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market's Rising Momentum Is Quite Strong</h3>
<p>Xinfeng 洋行 reported on the 5th that the New York stock market's trend was good last week, bonds were strong, the US dollar was stable, and commercial news was favorable to the bulls, including increased automobile and steel production, and a surge in wholesale and retail sales. The market was unusually active. Although there were some bulls coming out at the end, the result was still a rise of several jiao to three yuan. The Wenli 脱 preferential stock soared 34 yuan, reaching 98 yuan. The Dow Jones industrial stock index once broke the 111 mark, which was the first time since 1931. The peak of each stock emerged, and the whole world came to buy, and China also made a large purchase. The full-day turnover was 4,940,000 shares. Bonds were especially noticed by the public and continued to soar. The situation was still good. "Wheat" was strong because of the strong stock market and cotton. The drought has not yet stopped, and the market will eventually tend to rise. The scope of "cotton" buyers has expanded, including domestic and foreign pricing purchases. The bulls' settlement has strengthened the market position. Private reports of reduced planting are still going smoothly, and compulsory measures will be temporarily put behind. Commerce is booming with the new monetary foundation. Except for occasional reactions, prices will tend to rise. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 110.74 Up 1.33</p>
<p>Twenty Railway Stocks 52.97 Up 1.12</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks 29.60 Up 1.20</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 91.48 Up 0.63</p>
<p>Eleven Items 54.54 Up 0.36</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>As Cotton Is High, So Is Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm. As raw cotton rises, the yarn market is aroused by it. At the same time, the sales of current yarn are more active, so scattered shorts have a bit of cover. The situation is tighter, and people's hearts are also firm. What will happen in the future depends on actual transactions.</p>
<p>(People's Standard Rose Eight Jiao) At the opening of the People's Standard in the previous market, the cotton market was good, and the shorts' activities were covered, with each month rising by 2.3 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the current yarn transactions were better, and each month rose by 4.5 jiao. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 6,000 bales. It was found that Jifeng sold 300 bales, Taichang 400 bales, Shenji 600 bales, Dachang 400 bales, and Hengde 250 bales.

<p>(Actual Demand Is Stronger Than Before) The sales of current yarn are slightly booming, more than before. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 887 bales throughout the day. The Shuangma quotation fell by 5 jiao, and the rest did not move. The amount of each gang's purchase is as follows.</p>
<p>Guangdong 165 Xiamen 5 Fujian 4 Colleagues 10</p>
<p>Shantou 15 Nanjing 5 Mainland 120 Changsha 4</p>
<p>00 Ningbo 17 Yunnan 140 Zhenjiang 6</p>
<p>Cotton markets are suddenly anxious, and the rising trend is more intense. Because Indian cotton rose sharply, and the exchange rate did not move, the calculated price was one yuan higher per load than the previous day. Here, the shorting activities were covered, and the market rose sharply. However, Yuan Daho sold as much as possible when prices rose, and the market's current cotton factory demand was quite stagnant. However, foreign cotton is still firm.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Soars)</p>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Standard in the previous market, it rose along with foreign cotton. Scattered households covered the shorts, and each month rose by 1.2 jiao. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment in the market was particularly strong, but Yuan Da greatly sold, and each month rose by another 1.5 jiao to 2.5 jiao. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 63,400 loads. It was found that Yuan Da sold 5,300 loads, 恊生 1,800 loads, Chunji 1,900 loads, Jifeng 2,800 loads, Zhenda 2,500 loads, Xinhua 3,200 loads, Xinheng 3,300 loads, Taichang 1,700 loads, 賡豐 bought 4,300 loads, Meiji 4,400 loads, Yifeng 6,800 loads, Dafeng 2,000 loads, Suilong 1,800 loads, Ruida 2,000 loads, Renfeng 1,700 loads, Yuanxingchang 2,300 loads, and Yongda 1,400 loads. The closing price is as follows.</p>

<p>April 4295 40 168,100</p>
<p>(Factory Demand Is Cold) The sales of current cotton are quite clear, but the factory's appetite is still stagnant. The source is calculated as 330 bales of Yao cotton and 786 bales of Tong cotton. The current cotton prices are as follows.</p>
<p>North Market Cotton 38.50 Shenxin Factory Entered 400 Bales Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 50.50 Tongxing Factory Entered 165 Pieces Again</p>
<p>Standard Revision Problem</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was the Final Discussion</h3>
<p>-Details Will Be Explored and Recorded Later-</p>
<p>The local yarn and cloth exchange's problem of revising the standard for new yarn, although it was once resolved, could not be implemented due to some reason. According to yesterday's news, there was a joint meeting in the afternoon, which was the final meeting. The details will be explored and recorded later.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Cotton Market Is in a Firm Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market initially rose because foreign merchants bought and Chinese merchants were strong, and then weakened due to bulls settling. As a result, spot goods did not move, and futures rose by 2 to 5 points. Liverpool spot cotton rose by 21 points, and futures rose by 15 to 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 22 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose because speculators and scattered Japanese merchants bought, and then fell back due to some European exporters selling. As a result, the flat price rose by 1.5 rupees, Aomura rose by 4 rupees and 7.5 jiao, and Bairuo Creek rose by 6 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (5th telegram).</p>

<h3>Factories Dump Forward Flour</h3>
<p>- Drops of About 1.5 Cents Each Month -</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a sluggish appearance again. The quoted price of foreign wheat also fluctuated uncertainly, such as Chicago up 1.10, Canada up 4/8, only the market sentiment, due to the factory's continued foreign wheat transaction the day before, for the far period flour, naturally took the opportunity to get out. So the market atmosphere was empty and soft, and the buying was very quiet. Until the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere for each month, generally hovering, although the factory wanted to dump, but very few buyers, just lacking counterparties. According to the current situation, the weak purchasing power is felt. Even if there are large bulls, it is not easy to support it. As a result, this month remained unchanged from the previous day, March and April fell 1.25 cents, May fell 1.5 cents, June fell 1.75 cents, July only opened at 5.5 cents in the morning, calculated a drop of 2.5 cents, and did not open in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Downriver Rice Prices Stabilized</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only over twenty ships arrived from various gangs (over three thousand stones), of which only three or four were thick japonica, and the rest were late rice. However, although the retail and wholesale sales channels were prosperous, there were still many remaining goods, so the market showed a stable situation. For other goods such as Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xitang, the Northern Ocean gang continued to accept over two thousand packages, and the market prices did not fluctuate. For Chang Gang’s japonica from Sutong, Nangang, etc., store sales remained unbroken, and the market prices did not rise or fall. However, Du Yangjian continued to weaken by nearly a cent due to sluggish sales, and the supply of Bian Yin Yuan exceeded demand, so the market looked slightly bearish.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-one or two ships arrived from various places downriver. Sales in the market were sluggish and prices were cleverly adjusted. Market prices for white japonica and Yang Du, port customer tip prices, were down several cents. White Yuan and Yin Yuan were stable, and early thin rice prices were down by nearly a cent.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ke Xian Rice Inventory in Shanghai at 560,000 Bags</h3>
<p>100,000 Bags More Than the Same Period Last Year</p>
<p>Due to the cessation of acceptance and the stoppage, the total inventory of foreign Ke Xian rice reached 560,000 bags, 100,000 bags more than last year. However, last year's inventory included only 40,000 bags of domestic Ke Xian rice, while this year there are as many as 350,000 bags. Detailed numbers are as follows:</p>

<h3>Good Situation in Overseas Silk Market</h3>
<p>(Yokohama Raw Silk Rises Sharply) Recently, the Yokohama raw silk market has seen sharp rises in silk prices due to the launch of silk sales in Europe and America. Both spot silk and futures silk have risen to over 680-690 yen, an increase of 30-40 yen compared to the middle of last month, and the exchange rate to Chinese currency has broken through the 600 yuan mark.</p>
<p>(Wuxi Factory Merchants Transport to Shanghai for Sale) Recently, due to the launch of spring sales in the Shanghai foreign firm silk market, European firms have started to purchase, and American sales have also gradually turned around. Therefore, Wuxi manufacturers are actively transporting stored silk to Shanghai for sale. In recent days, Jinji, Zhenyi, and other factories have shipped 120 packages of white factory silk with the "Golden Double Deer," "Double Deer," and "Moon Rabbit" brands, which have already been put on the shelves for sale.</p>
<p>(European and American Factory Orders Received) In the overseas raw silk market, due to active factory orders, most of the silk in the hands of general importers has been sold, and inventories are gradually thinning. New York Ang Li silk prices have continued to rise. New orders for yellow and white factory silk have continued to come from overseas. Unfortunately, the incoming price of New York white factory silk is still 40-50 yuan different from the cost of various factories, so negotiations are still difficult to conclude. Yesterday, French firms and others imported 40 packages of white factory silk and 20 packages of yellow factory silk, and prices were firm and rising.</p>

<h3>Horse Shoe Nail Sales Turning Active</h3>
<p>Horse shoe nails have recently been inquired about by guest merchants, and embellishments in this street are also very prosperous. Therefore, even before the closing period, over three to four hundred boxes have been transacted. Prices are as follows: No. 5 opens at 16.5 yuan per box, No. 6 at 17 yuan, No. 7 at 17.25 yuan, and No. 8 at 17.35 yuan. Yesterday, incoming prices from overseas have increased, so the local market has a stable appearance.</p>
<h3>Pig Lead Temporarily Shows No Signs of Improvement</h3>
<p>The trend of pig lead has recently remained normal. Therefore, according to industry insiders, it is feared that there will be no signs of improvement within the old lunar year. The market situation shows no opportunity for progress. Although various colleagues feel the need to increase prices due to cost concerns, they ultimately have no way to make prices rise.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Reflections on "Guangzhou Like This"</h3>
<p>— Yue Ke</p>
<p>A few days ago, there was an article on "Free Talk" called "Guangzhou Like This," which quoted newspapers from treacherous areas and described how shopkeepers made large statues of Zhao Gongming (God of Wealth) and Li Kui (a fictional character), embedding electric lights in their eyes to suppress the tiger sign across the street. It was truly vividly written. Naturally, the purpose was to satirize the superstitions of the people of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The superstition of the Cantonese people seems to be quite considerable. Walking through the alleyways of Shanghai where people from all directions gather, if you see someone setting off firecrackers, or lighting incense and candles on the ground outside the door, nine times out of ten it's a Cantonese person. This can easily make the new party angry. However, the Cantonese are serious about their superstitions, with a certain vigor. For example, those large statues of Zhao Gongming and Li Kui probably cost at least a hundred dollars to make. The Han sought pearls, and Wu sought elephants. People from the Central Plains have always gone to Guangdong to plunder treasures, but it seems they haven't been plundered into poverty yet. They can still expend so much effort to deal with a fake tiger. Otherwise, they would simply fight to the death. This shows the seriousness of their superstition.</p>
<p>In reality, who in China is not superstitious? It's just that their superstitions are so unproductive that others don't pay attention. For example, if there's a tiger sign across the street, most shopkeepers will feel uncomfortable. However, in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they probably wouldn't put in so much effort to fight it. They would just spend a copper coin to buy a strip of red paper, write "Jiang Taigong is here, all taboos are forbidden" or "Mount Tai Stone Dares to Offend," and quietly stick it up, settling down in this way. It's still superstition, but it's so small-minded, lacking vitality, and on its last legs. It won't even provide you with material for "Free Talk."</p>
<p>Instead of superstitious prevarication, it's better to be serious. If believing in ghosts still requires money, I approve of burying copper coins in the ground like the people of the Northern Song Dynasty did. Nowadays, burning a few paper ingots is not only deceiving others and oneself, but it's simply deceiving ghosts. Many things in China are left with only an empty name and a false appearance, precisely because of a lack of seriousness.</p>
<p>The superstition of the Cantonese is not worthy of emulation, but their seriousness is worth learning from and admirable.</p>
<h3>Twilight Scenery of the Confucian Forest</h3>
<p>— Bai Ge</p>
<p>Arriving in the deep autumn when red leaves are flying, and standing in the Confucian Forest at sunset, one cannot help but feel endless emotion.</p>
<p>This great holy land of the East has recently become desolate beyond recognition. Except for the archway at the entrance with the words "Forest of the Utmost Sage," which still majestically maintains its original appearance, everything else has changed color with the vicissitudes of human affairs. The red walls on both sides are like backboards covered with many plasters, their surfaces marred by all sorts of grandiose slogans. Some of the ancient trees along the road have fallen and decayed on the ground, losing the order of their aligned rows. But at the vast front gate, there are many protection orders issued by teachers, commanders, and directors, standing side by side like majestic guards. At this moment, a heart in awe of the sacred authority will tremble abruptly before these bayonets. Furthermore, one cannot help but feel that the sage and holy land once revered by emperors of past dynasties must now be protected by some teachers, commanders, and directors. Confucius, who traveled through various states and never sought a small position, probably would not willingly compromise himself in this way, would he?</p>
<p>Arriving at the second gate, one sees the withered "Zigon's Hand-Planted Scholar Tree" on the right, which can only be considered a remnant. At the same time, a group of men who look like soldiers but are not quite soldiers rush over to offer tea. It is said that they are the guardians of the forest, also descendants of Confucius, who only receive a small amount of grain from the Confucian Mansion each year to indicate their upkeep, and their livelihood depends entirely on the donations of visiting tourists. One must leave a dime or two after drinking their tea. Truly worthy of being from a family of propriety and righteousness, their hospitality is indeed not easily found elsewhere. But one cannot help but suspect that they are living off the sale of the honor of their dead ancestors, and wonder if they have accepted the teachings of "being happy in poverty and enjoying propriety in wealth." And a sense of desolation suddenly fills one's heart. Walking straight ahead, slightly uphill to the left, one reaches Confucius' tomb. Behind the tomb stands a scholar tree, covered with red leaves, that seems like and yet isn't a scholar tree, surrounded by towering ancient cypresses and pines. To the right is Zigong's mourning hut where he kept vigil, and a little further to the left is the pavilion where Emperor Qianlong and others stayed, resembling a court surrounded by officials. At this moment, another feeling of solemnity arises. Strolling forward, the sparse cemetery and shallow grassland are a place where one can both look up to the sky and roar, and wander and hum softly. Even if one does not need to visit each tomb in order, one will have a lingering thought, making one feel an indescribable mood like "Thus it passes away, like this stream!". Turning back and standing on the Zhu River Bridge to look out, another kind of world lies before one's eyes. The reeds on both banks flutter into white waves, which cannot but give rise to a feeling of detachment from the world. Going downstream, one can see red tides rolling in the endless white waves, which cannot but make one think of the famous line "fallen flowers and flowing water merging," which is precisely the short red tree drifting in the reeds. If one climbs the wall tower again and looks into the distance, it looks like a cluster of wheat stalks bearing countless spring cocoons, which will immediately make one feel endless longing for home. Looking up at the floating clouds in the sky, the hazy sunset containing the mountain gorges has long since disappeared. A remaining heart has no choice but to seek the lonely return journey through the desolate and smoky wilderness.</p>
<p>I think that the twilight years of some people will be about the same as this, but how many people can get such brilliant twilight years!</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Reading Ancient Books</h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>"What ancient books should I read?" Many friends often ask me this. Perhaps because they know that I had a study life for many years when I was young, they regard me as a "knowing old horse". In fact, although I have read ancient books for several years, I am not some "national essence scholar", and my opinions are certainly not worth a smile from "authorities". However, discussing my own experience of reading ancient books may provide a reference for "friends who want to read ancient books". I don't think reading ancient books is a necessary condition for improving new literary and artistic skills. Many people think that without a foundation in ancient books, one cannot write good new literature and art. In fact, this view has no scientific basis. Indeed, some new literary artists such as Lu Xun and Hu Shi have read ancient books, but this cannot prove that reading ancient books is a necessary condition for new literary and artistic skills. For example, Sima Qian once traveled to famous mountains and rivers, so some people insist that the goodness of the Historical Records article comes from famous mountains and rivers. But there are certainly more than just Sima Qian who have traveled to famous mountains and rivers. Why can't others write the articles of the Historical Records? From another perspective, Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty came from a rogue background and had not read many ancient books at that time because they were all burned by Qin Shihuang, but his "Ode to the Great Wind" has always been regarded as a timeless masterpiece. Furthermore, many new literary writers now have not read ancient books, but they do not necessarily write new literature and art badly.</p>
<p>In practice, ancient books cannot provide any important help for the techniques of new literature and art - style, sentence construction, word usage, etc. Not to mention the literature and art of the pre-Qin period, just looking at the Selections of Refined Literature by Prince Zhao Ming, which was previously considered a required course, there are very few works that are useful for new literature and art. For example, the "Rhapsodies on the Two Capitals" and the "Rhapsodies on the Three Capitals" are both recognized as great. But may I ask, what use are these question-and-answer styles, the otter-sacrifice-like allusions, the rockery-building-like diction, and the couplet-like sentence construction for us? Some people say that at least reading it can increase vocabulary. That's right, there are indeed many strange and obscure words, but since one has to read "Li Shan's Annotations" to understand them, how can they naturally rush to the tip of the pen when writing? Even if they rush to it, then after the article is written, one must find a Li Jing to annotate it before the reader can understand it. This is too much trouble, and where can one find Li Shan in this day and age?</p>
<p>Works from the Tang and Song dynasties and later are relatively closer to our era, but they are still too far from vernacular, so they cannot make any great contribution to the techniques of new literature and art. This is not because there were no good literary and artistic works in the past that we could draw material from. It is truly because the gap between literary language and vernacular is so deep and thick that the possibility of integration is very small.</p>
<p>Unless one wants to do something like "reorganize the national heritage", we really do not need to read ancient books. If it is for literary and artistic cultivation, one can choose a few representative works from ancient times at will and flip through them in one's spare time, which is sufficient. If one can read more types, of course, that would be good, but it is not necessarily beneficial to the techniques of new literary and artistic writing. In addition, I think it is necessary to read a few books on literary history and history. One can roughly know about the historical changes of literature, the era of writers, and the historical background of the era. It is a pity that the Chinese publishing industry is still lagging behind in many ways. For example, there are no fine and excellent selected editions of representative works of past dynasties that meet the needs of the times, nor is there a perfect general history of our country from the perspective of historical materialism. Otherwise, scholars could save a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p>I do not object to reading some ancient books for the cultivation of literature and art, because this is our legacy and we are of course free to enjoy it. However, the legacy of literature and art, like the legacy of a family, also has poisonous components. People who inherit the legacy are most likely to become property-guarding people who "do not engage in production." If the descendants are unworthy, each generation will be worse than the last, and in the end, only a "bankrupt wealthy family" will remain. The drawbacks of reading ancient books often lead readers to regard ancient works as models, cultivate a mentality of imitation, and lose the courage to create. They only care about moving the outdated allusions and stale words, filling their works with dead people's words, gradually moving further and further away from living literature and art, and finally following the ancients into the tombs of the times.</p>
<p>In short, reading ancient books cannot make the techniques of new literature and art progress in any way, at least in my personal experience. The techniques of new literature and art must be created in the words of living people in order to have life and have a vigorous power. This is what ancient books cannot give us.</p>
<h3>The Lying Husband</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>On this day, the young husband's heart was uneasy, as if he had lost his soul. Although he had arrived at his own door, he forgot to raise his hand to knock.</p>
<p>The scene in the manager's office was constantly flashing in his mind: the manager, with a ruddy face, was crossing his legs and comfortably warming himself by the electric stove, welcoming him in with a false smile. He first engaged in some polite conversation with him, starting with the reliance he had placed on him over the past few years, and then talking about the recent universal economic downturn. Then he got to the point, saying that the store's business had also been affected by the downturn, to the point where it could not be maintained without layoffs. Because of this fact, he had to ask him to seek other employment. Then he said many words of apology before sending him out the door. At that time, he faintly heard a "clang-" sound, and the bowl that he had relied on to live for several years began to shatter.</p>
<p>It was from that moment that he began his uneasiness. This uneasiness transported him from the store to his own door, and never stopped.</p>
<p>Standing at his own door, a great anguish gripped the young husband's heart, causing him to completely lose all courage. He did not know how he would maintain his livelihood in the future, how he would maintain this lovely and happy family, and moreover, there was a major obstacle in front of him. He did not know how he would phrase things to his beloved wife.</p>
<p>Without even time to think, the door opened with a "crack" in his anguish, and the young wife poked her head out from behind the door. She seemed to want to come out to look at the scenery on the street, but unexpectedly saw her ghost-like husband face to face. She couldn't help but cry out in surprise.</p>
<p>"Why are you standing here silently?"</p>
<p>The young husband had to force himself to cheer up. He pretended to smile, shook his head, indicating that he was fine, and quickly took his beloved wife's hand and walked into the house. He tried his best to restrain himself, not allowing a trace of his unhappiness to leak into her eyes. He talked and laughed with her as usual, and dreamily told her many future hopes and plans. Furthermore, in order to show that he was currently happy, he even turned on the phonograph, letting the loud sound crash around the room.</p>
<p>But his heart was still deeply surrounded by anguish. Looking at the happy and blissful atmosphere in the house, and thinking that this would soon come to naught, and would take away the lives of both him and his beloved wife, he immediately felt as if the sofa he was sitting on was covered with steel needles, piercing him painfully.</p>
<p>Even lying in bed at night, the young husband's heart could not find peace. He was just tossing and turning in bed in anguish. It was not until his wife asked him in surprise why he wasn't asleep yet that he let out a few dry laughs and said:</p>
<p>"Darling, it's nothing, I'll be asleep right away."</p>
<p>The next morning, the young husband got out of bed early. The sleepless night had filled his eyes with red threads. But he still had to pretend to be very busy with his duties. He kissed his wife as usual, said goodbye to her, and closed the door gently as usual.</p>
<p>Walking alone on the road, a question stood in the young husband's heart: where to spend this long time? He thought of many places, and finally felt that it would be better to go to the library to read. So, he walked towards the library.</p>
<p>Sitting in the quiet library, a book was spread out in front of him, but he had no mood to read it. Words in black kept jumping before his eyes: "Unemployment," "Despair," "Borrowing," "Death," and the day quickly passed. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Wet Nurse (5)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuanpeng</p>
<p>The female guests drank wine, and everyone became excited. The aunt, who didn't talk much, also turned into a talkative person. She praised the child and also praised the wet nurse who raised the child. She said to the wife in front of her:</p>
<p>"Your wet nurse is really young, only about twenty years old, she must be ten years younger than you, right?"</p>
<p>"Young? Haha, the child's father picked her, he said that young people have more milk, so he chose her..."</p>
<p>The wife said these words reluctantly and laboriously, feeling somewhat uneasy in her heart. In front of the young wet nurse, the wife felt that she was getting old. Women are naturally fond of comparing this thing with that thing, fond of comparing themselves with others.</p>
<p>After the banquet, the guests chatted with each other, and suddenly the conversation turned to the wet nurse again.</p>
<p>"You told me a few days ago that the wet nurse was very dirty and wore ragged clothes. Today, seeing her, she is dressed neatly, young, and her character is also acceptable..." The little aunt asked the wife.</p>
<p>"She's dressing up now," the wife said.</p>
<p>"Oh, she also knows how to dress up..."</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the third day, the wife suddenly ordered the wet nurse:</p>
<p>"Go back, I've hired someone else."</p>
<p>"Why are you telling me to leave? Didn't you tell me to raise the child until he grows up before going home? Have I done anything wrong? Madam."</p>
<p>The wife never said the reason.</p>
<p>The female cook was also surprised. She simply didn't understand the wife's temper: "What kind of wet nurse does the wife want to choose to be satisfied? The previous wet nurse was twice as beautiful as the wife herself, and she was dismissed in a week... This one is ten years younger than the wife, but she's dismissed after only a month... The wet nurse is young, has a lot of milk, and the child is fed fat..." (The End)</p>

<h3>Re-examining the "Yellow Peril"</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The sounds of war in the world grow more urgent day by day. Due to the worsening situation in the Far East, Europe and America are constantly issuing warnings, shouting seductive and anesthetizing terms like national unity, revival, prosperity, military preparedness, etc., to incite and summon the hungry masses, urging them to endure hardship for the glory of the nation and race. How imposing are those who incite and summon, with resounding war drums and clearly displayed banners, flaunting their power!</p>
<p>The world, groping for a path forward in the darkness, humanity moaning in blood and gore, Mussolini, the eccentric in the eyes of the world, has again fantastically proclaimed the Yellow Peril, saying, "The Far Eastern dominance of white civilization and the fate of the Pacific depend on how China develops in the next hundred years. We can imagine that the fusion of China and Japan in the future is not impossible, but who can guarantee that their unity will not be against Europe and America?" Alas, these are truly the words of an eccentric!</p>
<p>Raising the banner of the Yellow Peril must have other intentions. The barbarity and violence of the Japanese are also a fact that triggers the minds of Yellow Peril proponents. We need not cover up their barbarity and violence just because of their yellow faces. However, what is the "Yellow Peril"? Will it truly become a disaster for white people? We should say a few straightforward words about this.</p>
<p>In Europe and America, and in our enemy country, Japan, the conservatives are all guessing that the day will soon come when the white race and the yellow race will have a struggle like in the primitive era. They guess this way, so they propagate this way, and they prepare this way. Will there be a day when the white race and the yellow race will have a struggle like in the primitive era? Looking at it from the perspective of the world economy, it becomes clear at a glance.</p>
<p>Today's world economy, undeniably, has reached the final stage of disintegration. The cries of hunger and the wails of displacement overflow in every corner of the world. These are not struggles between yellow and white, but struggles among people of the same color and race. But even this is not enough; they must also wield their economic, political, and military power to conquer other races – weaker nations. This is the origin of so-called racial struggles, and the fact of the weak resisting the strong arises from this.</p>
<p>Today, international wars are breaking out. The global changes triggered by international economic relations are like the eve of a storm, with war about to erupt. However, this is not a war of races; it is a fierce battle between imperialist countries, or between them and socialist countries or weaker nations.</p>
<h3>Winter Plum and Nandina</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>After lunch, I went to the City God Temple alone. The temple is always crowded with so many people. I walked shoulder to shoulder across the Nine-Turn Bridge, and it seemed to me that coming to the City God Temple alone was too boring. I didn't want to get rich, nor did I want to live a long life. I wasn't sure about myself, so why bother to ask for help from so-called "Lords" and the like, so I angrily walked out. In front of the Small World, there were many winter plums and nandina, which seemed to interest me. I have a vase on my desk that a friend sent me from afar, but I can't afford expensive foreign flowers in the city, so I'm using it as a pen holder, which I'm really sorry for my friend's kindness in sending a goose feather from a thousand miles away; so I wrote a letter to tell him about the vase's side effects. His reply was indifferent, saying that putting it on my desk was already an unexpected honor for it, and that both flower arranging and pen holding were equally appreciating it. But thinking about it, putting flowers in a vase is as natural as putting pens in a pen holder. Today, I inadvertently discovered my beloved winter plums and nandina, and thought of how antique it would be to put them in the vase that my friend sent from afar; I even wanted to buy a small incense burner and burn three sticks of rue incense every day when I read and wrote, which would be very interesting. Thinking about it, I stopped. The seller, of course, knew the psychology of the customer. Seeing me staring blankly, he pulled down two branches of winter plum and nandina from the firewood stand, and like an artist appreciating his own work, he looked at me with his small eyes and said, "Sir, these two branches!" As he said this, he raised his hand a little higher, as if to tell me that they were even more extraordinary from a distance. In normal times, if I saw this kind of attitude, even if I went to the rice shop to buy rice to prepare dinner, I would rather tighten my belt and come back. But one cannot have hobbies; I was born loving flowers, just like Jia Baoyu was born loving rouge and powder. At that time, even if that small-eyed person put on an annoying attitude, I wouldn't be too annoyed; the winter plums and nandina in his hand were indeed lovely; I also tilted my head, pretending to appreciate them, and said, "How much?"</p>
<p>"Sir, you are a regular customer," he opened his mouth wide, laughing, his eyes looking even smaller, almost only seeing two piles of flesh, "Let's call it one dollar and forty cents." He stuck out his belly and brought the two branches of winter plum and nandina in front of me, his one palm facing the sky, as if a beggar begging for money on the road. But my palm couldn't stretch out; I wasn't a regular customer; if I were a regular customer, I wouldn't dare to ask "How much?" I knew myself that I only had three double-dimes in my newly made brocade crepe robe. A regular customer would naturally know that two branches of winter plum and nandina would sell for one dollar and forty cents. Would I dare to ask?</p>
<p>Looking at the flowers and not being able to get them, I seemed to only see that annoying attitude. I better leave quickly; putting pens in a vase isn't a crime after all; but that rough hand grabbed me, "Sir, you say." I naturally couldn't tell him that I only had sixty cents in my pocket; wouldn't that be an insult to this new robe!</p>
<p>"Too expensive!" I shook my head. The meaning of these two words indicated that I wasn't unable to afford it, but that the price was higher than the goods.</p>
<p>"Sir, you're used to buying, you say." The people around slowly gathered around. I thought they were all regular customers. People as idle as me wouldn't spend the whole afternoon wandering around the City God Temple; since I was in front of regular customers, I was asked "You say, you say" by that small-eyed person and didn't answer, wouldn't that make people laugh - not to mention the chins of the regular customers.</p>
<p>"Sixty cents." I said casually, confidently acting like a young master, even though my entire fortune had been declared bankrupt in this one sentence.</p>
<p>"Sir::" The small-eyed person just kept laughing. I thought this was an opportunity to leave, so I gracefully pushed away the two people in front of me, slowly started walking, and of course wanted to escape a little faster in my heart, but at least I should put on a good show at this time, and glanced at the second firewood stand. When the owner of that second stand - an old man with gray hair - stood up smiling, the loud "Sir" called me back. That small-eyed person stuffed the winter plum and nandina into my hand, "Sir, give whatever you want." I took it with one hand and rummaged in my pocket with the other for a long time, as if taking out sixty cents from a pile of money. The small-eyed person took the money, and unexpectedly opened his mouth and said, "Sir, Happy New Year, add a few cents if you like." Heavens! If I hadn't been wearing this new brocade crepe robe, I would have thrown the flowers and snatched back the sixty cents. Because I loved flowers, I sacrificed ten-tenths of my entire property. "New Year," what does it have to do with me, and even more so, what does it have to do with winter plums and nandina? Embarrassed to say that I didn't have another copper coin, I acted like a young master scolding a servant: "Sell if you sell, don't sell, forget it!" People are the most despicable animals after all. He silently hid the money and went to take the second deal.</p>
<p>Coming home, I took all the pens out of the vase, added water, and put in the winter plums and nandina, smiling quite contentedly; but I didn't dare to dream of buying any incense burners, as not having money was of course the main reason, and I was also afraid that my wife would see it and suspect that I was going to become a monk, so I wrote a letter telling my friend who sent me the vase about everything that happened, wondering what he would reply to me.</p>
<h3>The Sound of Selling Olives</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>In theory, the lunar calendar should have been abolished long ago, but in reality, the people still follow the custom of using the lunar calendar. Therefore, our intellect clearly knows that it is already February, but emotionally, we cannot help but feel the end of the year, because the surrounding environment is filled with the color of "the end of the year," and it seems impossible for us to forget it.</p>
<p>Of all the scenes of the end of the year, none touches me more deeply than the sound of selling olives in the middle of the night. Every year at this time, the sound of selling olives appears on the streets. It has the same effect as a clock, telling us that the season has reached the cold time, and another year has passed by in a hurry.</p>
<p>"Olives-sell, Sandalwood-scented-olives, sell-olives!"</p>
<p>This sound is so mournful and poignant that it often touches my heartstrings. Especially when it is late at night, and I am coming home from outside, suddenly seeing a seller of olives carrying a dim kerosene lamp in the dark alleys, I always have to slow down my pace and listen to this moving cry; or when I am reading under the lamp, and the sound of selling olives is heard from afar, I often close my eyes and listen, listening, and often unknowingly bring tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>It often evokes a vague, incredible emotion in me, as if it is pity, as if it is sadness, and also like sympathy; in short, it is full of kind and loving elements. It has a great and touching power. I think that even those revelers who are drunk in pink dreams, upon hearing this sound, would not fail to be startled. Listen, so poignantly:</p>
<p>"Olives sell, sandalwood-scented-olives, sell-olives!"</p>
<p>Since I have had feeling, I have not heard a more moving song than this. The olive seller is truly a great musician, and I wish to bless him here!</p>
<h3>The Heavy Pressure of Happiness</h3>
<p>— Lu Zi</p>
<p>"People cannot be too happy; if they are too happy, happiness will crush their lives." I heard these words while I was comfortably living in happiness.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh dumbly. Scorn climbed from my heart all the way to my face.</p>
<p>"Are there really people who are crushed by happiness? If so, then I should have been crushed long ago."</p>
<p>"Haven't you already been crushed? Alas, alas!" It seemed to echo in my ear with great regret.</p>
<p>"What? I've already been crushed!" I asked back in surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes!" Such a firm echo came.</p>
<p>I began to think. I felt that I was still me -- a very happy me. And there were still many people envying me? Really, my environment was very good. I was full of lightness and freedom, and there was not the slightest cumbersome weight? What's more, nothing had been crushed! This was really a rumor, and I couldn't help but feel angry.</p>
<p>"What heavy pressure? You liar!"</p>
<p>"I won't deceive you. I'm afraid it's still your own ignorance that's deceiving you, right? From the moment you were born, happiness fell on you, and your life cried. Later, the pressure of happiness increased day by day, and your life was destroyed day by day. But you will never cry again. You have become accustomed to the heavy pressure, and you have forgotten your life. The most pitiful thing in the world is a person who doesn't know that their life has been destroyed, and you are one of them."</p>
<p>"Oh, am I a pitiful person who doesn't know that their life has been destroyed? Then, what exactly is pressing down on me like this!"</p>
<p>"That is happiness, the source of your happiness -- inheritance."</p>
<p>"Inheritance? It's very good for me. It only gives me comfort and doesn't give me work. How can it press on me?"</p>
<p>"You think it's very good? That's why you've been crushed. It gives you a lot of happiness, but it hurts your life too much. The dirge is played while you are singing happily. Now you only have the empty form of life, and you no longer have the substance of life."</p>
<p>"No, I'm still the same as other people!"</p>
<p>"The same! Do you mean limbs and facial features? Then, what about your hands? Are your hands useful? Can they create anything? What about your feet? Can they walk on a smooth path? Can they blaze new trails? Can your brain even think? Can it think of things far away? Can your eyes even see? Can they see things as they truly are? But you, your whole body is just a combination of uselessness. Can this be said to be the same as other people? You, the destroyer of your life."</p>
<p>"It's useless, so what? As long as I have a physical form, that's enough, as long as I'm very happy, that's enough."</p>
<p>"But you have no life."</p>
<p>"Don't I feel my existence?"</p>
<p>"The existence of life is not based on empty form, but on substance. A life must have the power of a life; like fire having light and heat. If it has no function at all, it is just a walking corpse."</p>
<p>I only heard this far, and then I couldn't hear anything below. I found myself lying on the ground, completely paralyzed; I also found many heavy things pressing on my body. I could not turn over, and only had painful groans.</p>
<p>Who said this to me? I will be permanently confused.</p>
<h3>"Ideal" and "Reality"</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>"Ideal is beautiful, reality is ugly!" This is the cry of young people who, after their beautiful dreams are shattered by reality, realize (?) it. This is further confirmed after reading Wen Bingjun's "Confession of an Ideal Life." Originally, young people who have not yet entered society, like the rising sun, have hearts full of red, blood boiling, spirits of striving, and thoughts of progress. To society, they build beautiful castles in the air, while at the same time harboring ambitions to reform society; when this wheel, full of sharp edges, rolls onto the rugged path of society, how many times can the tender, brittle sharp edges withstand grinding? So they break and fold, slowly becoming round and smooth, assimilating to the world. Rich in experience, smooth in dealing with people, the conditions for "being a person" are complete, and the foundation for standing in society is solid.</p>
<p>When the sharp edges are first injured, the beautiful castles in the air of young people are chopped down by the axe of "reality," and the ambition to reform society is stabbed by the sword of "reality." Thus, the chain of bitterness locks the hearts of young people, and when there is nowhere to place their enthusiasm and nowhere to sprinkle their hot blood, they curse "reality" on the one hand, and pursue "ideal" on the other, comparing the beautiful "ideal" with the ugly "reality," like comparing Mo Mu with Xi Shi, with a clear distinction between ugliness and beauty!</p>
<p>What Wen Bingjun said in "Confession of an Ideal Life": ":::decided to live the life of a recluse like those former sages:::" ":::let the bright moon accompany me, let the clear spring illuminate my heart:::" ":::as for the world, I am willing to abandon it to that group of snobs, let them meet in the conference with bombs and guns! Let them friends harm friends, relatives harm relatives:::" This said everything that young people full of indignation and jealousy want to say in their hearts, although it is not necessarily this ideal, at least the motivation is consistent, the only difference is the method!</p>
<p>I do not deny Wen Bingjun's words, and I have a twelve-point sympathy for Wen Bingjun, but in this chaotic world where black and white are reversed, can everything be thrown away, become a person in a peach blossom spring, maintain "purity of self" and "cultivate oneself in solitude" to reform it? I am afraid that the snobs will use bombs and guns to make it even darker, more reversed, and more chaotic.</p>
<p>Chuchuan Bocun said well in Symbol of Bitterness: "Iron and stone strike each other, sparking fire, torrents and rocks collide, flying out foam, producing red rainbows, similarly, two kinds of forces collide with each other, exhibiting a gorgeous kaleidoscope of life, that is, the various aspects of life." "Our life, our existence, has already fundamentally lost its meaning. Because there is the bitterness of life and the bitterness of war, people have the value of life." If Qu Yuan had been a stable official, the Lisao would not have been produced. If Sima Qian had not been subjected to palace punishment and imprisoned, how could the Historical Records have been accomplished. The mediocre life of dandy sons and the success of great men must go through thousands of hardships. These are all the results of the collision of forces. Then the youth's encounters with setbacks are excellent touchstones, so why curse, hate, and be bitter?</p>
<p>Young people! Don't lie in the embrace of "ideal," ignoring and forgetting "reality," but turn the beautiful "ideal" into "reality," and change the ugly "reality" into the beautiful "ideal." You must know that "reality" without "ideal" is ugly, and good "reality" is based on "ideal." The success of scientists is based on ideals. "Ideal" is the beginning of "reality," and "reality" is the end of "ideal." If you do it from beginning to end, there is no reason why things will not succeed.</p>

<h3>Inside the Classroom</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>The bell, leisurely, shattered the silence of the dormitory in the early morning: in the air, depressingly, coldly, it drilled into every empty heart. Gently, I exhaled from my heart.</p>
<p>The few maple trees on the basketball court have shed their lush youth, revealing a haggard and sickly state; yellow leaves</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>fly in patches, covering the ground. A few sparrows, lively, are looking for their food, chirping, chirping, and flapping their wings to fly east at the slightest sound. The sunlight shines down from the basketball hoop, and you can no longer feel much heat, but a gust of morning wind brings a bit of chill.</p>
<p>Wearing that flannel, with tweed breeches on, slowly dragging, dragging, the heavy leather shoes making a heavy sound, I moved towards that gloomy classroom.</p>
<p>The tired body slumped heavily into the chair, gently panting, the classroom presenting a gray and desolate gloom.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, the tall and thin man with a black briefcase, jumped lightly onto the podium, loudly calling the roll, and the response was a tired, faint "Here."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's clear and bright Ningbo accent spun in the air, failing to fly into everyone's ears, as if a curfew had been imposed. Every gray face showed an impatient mood, and the bodies swayed uncomfortably in the chairs, the dilapidated chairs making a burst of "creaking" sounds. Thus, the classroom slowly stirred.</p>
<p>A clear, beautiful, and charming figure flitted before Little Li's eyes, and then scenes of interesting memories unfolded before him.</p>
<p>That day on Sunday, the moment at the Grand Theater was truly perfect – smooth hands, full breasts, soft whispers, and those two vermilion lips. If the lights in the cinema hadn't come on, then taking it a step further would have been really great! Alas, what a pity, I have to wait another week, a week of life like sitting in jail. Alas, I'm so stupid...</p>
<p>"Bang," a fist hit the table.</p>
<p>People were startled and turned their heads in surprise to look at him. After that, there was a burst of laughter. He shamefully retracted that hand, still feeling a burning pain, lowered his head, and blushed in silence.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone patted him on the shoulder. He awkwardly turned his head and saw a "wild monk" holding a piece of paper in his hand, stuffing it into his hand, and making a grimace at him. Looking at the paper, he saw only the following written on it:</p>
<p>"Daydreaming of Little Lotus, dreaming at night,</p>
<p>Longing for you, tears welling up,</p>
<p>Heart on fire when I think of hatred,</p>
<p>Bang, startling the classroom."</p>
<p>Following this was a full classroom of strange laughter, interrupting Mr. Ningbo's teaching. At this time, the sun had shone from the window lattice onto everyone's face. The sound of "beep beep" from cars also came from the road.</p>
<p>People slowly became lively, breaking the silent air, talking, talking about the movie at the Grand Theater, and everything at the Central Racquetball Court and the Da Hu Ballroom.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the bell rang clearly, striking everyone's heartstrings, perking them up. They rushed out, took the basketball to play on the playground, forgetting everything, and their faces were full of spring in autumn.</p>
<p>The tall, thin Mr. Wang, dejectedly, took his briefcase and slowly walked out of the classroom.</p>

<h3>Whether a Divorce is Possible When a Husband is Kidnapped</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Recently, I have been pondering a matter that has caused me endless worry, confining me to a state of melancholy. Though it may seem trivial, I dare to seek assistance from you, hoping you will not hesitate to enlighten me.</p>
<p>In January of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], we arranged for my younger sister to marry. The other party was a middle-class farming family, with some assets, and the brother-in-law was an only son. Therefore, after the marriage, they lived in great harmony. Unexpectedly, before three months had passed, they were targeted by bandits, and he was kidnapped. It is said that they negotiated with the kidnappers several times, but due to disagreements over the ransom, no progress has been made to this day. However, rumors have spread that he has been killed. My younger sister has been widowed for nearly two years. As time passes and youth fades, how can she not be heartbroken? As her close relative, I have always wanted to speak on her behalf. However, the other party is unsophisticated, and I fear they might be unreasonable. Furthermore, I am not familiar with the law, so I have hesitated until now to intervene.</p>
<p>I now present four questions:</p>
<p>(1) Can she request a divorce? (2) If a divorce is possible, can she take her dowry with her? (3) Since the other party has no descendants, can she request alimony? (4) If she obtains alimony, can she remarry?</p>
<p>I earnestly request a detailed response. I eagerly await good news.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shi Zheng,</p>
<p>May 2nd</p>
<p>P.S. This letter purely reflects my younger sister's wishes and is not written under any duress.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding the four questions raised in the letter, we reply as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the husband's death can be definitively proven, remarriage would naturally not be a problem. However, according to the letter, "no progress has been made to this day, and rumors have spread that he has been killed." While one might imagine that your sister's husband is no longer alive, there is ultimately no concrete evidence of his death. Therefore, she cannot remarry based on "presumed death." However, if this situation continues indefinitely, it would be greatly detrimental to your sister. Thus, the current Civil Code stipulates that divorce may be sought if a spouse's "whereabouts are unknown for more than three years." It appears that your sister will need to wait another year to seek a divorce.</p>
<p>(2) "A divorced woman, regardless of the reason for the divorce, is entitled to take with her items which are solely for her personal use, as this constitutes her separate property." (See Judgment No. 233 on divorce litigation). Therefore, this is not a problem.</p>
<p>(3) (4) The provisions for claiming alimony are found in Articles 1056 and 1057 of the current Civil Code. The former concerns claims for damages, while the latter concerns claims for alimony. You can consult the relevant articles yourself. However, the provision for alimony is purely intended to prevent the other party from falling into hardship. After remarriage, when someone else is responsible for her support, there would seem to be no grounds for claiming alimony. However, claiming alimony does not restrict remarriage, so she can remarry even if she obtains alimony.</p>

<h3>The Lonely Person (8)</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>Xiao Xun also stood up at the same time, nodded to Jingwen's mother, and the two of them walked out of the bridal chamber.</p>
<p>Male and female guests surrounded them from all sides, leaving a narrow aisle in the middle. Countless pairs of eyes were looking at Kejia and Jingyi as they walked in from the outside. Qinbo was already standing beside the bride, Jingwen hurriedly pushed Xiao Xun out, and thus a pair of "jilted" protagonists enveloped a pair of "farce" protagonists.</p>
<p>Naturally, among the many male and female guests, those who knew the past of the four individuals, all sorts of teasing and speculation flew from the human barrier and entered the ears of each of the four.</p>
<p>Jingyi smiled and stayed by the side of Yeniu. Kejia played his part with a serious face. Qinbo nonchalantly showed that she was an old hand at being a bride. Xiao Xun lowered his head, his naturally loose hair dancing on top of his head. In the midst of laughter and joyful hymns, a great "farce" was completed.</p>
<p>Colorful streamers and confetti flew in front of everyone, pushing and shoving. As the newlyweds went into the bridal chamber, Xiao Xun slipped out like smoke. He stepped on the aisle that Jingyi and Kejia had just taken from the car and headed out the door. He felt that he was a lonely person, abandoned by the world. He regretted coming to Shanghai. Hangzhou had quiet ancient temples, deep mountains, the West Lake for boating, a small building to cultivate one's character, everything suitable for a lonely person. He even resented Kejia for deliberately flaunting his union with Jingyi in front of him. He would rather admit that he did not have the measure of a woman, that he was a weakling in the hands of women. He lowered his head and walked towards the door, shaking his naturally loose and curly hair. Suddenly, a woman's voice called his name from behind. He thought it was Jingwen and ignored it, walking straight ahead. However, the one who caught up with him side by side was Qinbo, whom he did not want to see.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" she patted his shoulder, like a lover.</p>
<p>Xiao Xun laughed nervously, "Buying cigarettes," he answered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"I have some." She took out a delicate cigarette case from her handbag, offered a cigarette to Xiao Xun, and lit it, bringing it close to Xiao Xun's lips.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I want to take a walk on Nanjing Road," he said, seeing that Qinbo was holding his arm, wanting him to go back in.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's take a walk together." This was an attitude of the girl that was completely unexpected by Xiao Xun.</p>
<p>The March spring breeze stirred the hearts of every young man and woman, stirred the flags of great sales, and stirred Zhu Xiao Xun's naturally loose and curly hair. The two of them walked hand in hand like a couple, without speaking, taking such short steps, along the racecourse, to Nanjing Road. Qinbo thought that Xiao Xun was buying something. After walking for a while, he still had his head lowered. Naturally, a clever girl understood everything. She forcefully pushed Xiao Xun's arm in the crook of her elbow, saying with an extremely sincere attitude:</p>
<p>"Xiao Xun, are you still angry with me?" Her pupils seemed to shrink, and her brows were locked tightly.</p>
<p>"Qinbo, why do you still bring up such things?" He laughed nervously, shaking his naturally loose and curly hair.</p>
<p>"You should forgive me, Li Shaojie is not a person!" Her high heels heavily hit the cement.</p>
<p>Reader, I will tell you an amazing piece of evidence that the earth is round. Xiao Xun and Qinbo kept walking forward, but they arrived in front of the hotel; as for whether they had turned a corner, I did not pay attention.</p>
<p>However, there was someone in front of the hotel who noticed - it was Jingwen. After a flurry of commotion in the temporary bridal chamber, they discovered that a pair of male and female attendants were missing. There was the sign of that naturally loose and curly hair. A waiter told them that he had walked out with a female guest. Jingwen rushed to the front of the door and saw the two of them, but they themselves did not know that they had circled the "earth" once.</p>
<p>"Little brother:" she shouted with a smile.</p>
<p>Of course, a clever man also understands everything. Xiao Xun threw off Qinbo's arm and ran forward a few steps.</p>
<p>"Haven't seen Shanghai for three months," everything has changed! He shook his naturally loose and curly hair.</p>

<h3>Mr. Dareos's Prediction: Hollywood's Trends This Year (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bing Jian</p>
<p>Garbo will leave the film industry forever</p>
<p>Fairbanks will return to Hollywood</p>
<p>We have seen many predictions about world affairs this year, but there seem to be few about the film industry.</p>
<p>The American film magazine "Modern Screen" published an article in its February issue about Hollywood's predictions. The predictor is the well-known Mr. Dareos in Hollywood. Mr. Dareos also made the same predictions at the beginning of last year, predicting 68 things. Of these 68 things, 48 were correct, i.e., 70%; 8 were wrong, i.e., 11%; and 12 had no results, accounting for 17%. Although his predictions are not 100% accurate, the 70% accuracy rate is quite remarkable. The following is a selection of the more important ones:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Mae West, who was the most popular last year. Mr. Dareos predicted that Mae West would still live a single life in 1934. Although she will continue to be romantic this year, she will eventually retain the title of Miss Mae West. In the film industry, her position will be further consolidated and become a red star. However, in terms of finances, she will generally lose some.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about Joan Crawford. Crawford's achievements this year can be said to have reached its peak. But after this, the better the year, the more she will fail. In terms of love, she may think she is satisfied, but she will never find true love. It will not be until 1935 that she can remarry.</p>
<p>Speaking of Garbo, it's simply bad luck. She will not be able to show any more amazing results in the future. If she does not give up her film career in 1934, then she will retire at the latest in 1935, and it will be her last and forever retirement. She will return to her hometown in Sweden.</p>
<p>Jenny Gaynor, this cute little bird, is going to be a bride again this year. Even if she cannot get married this year, she will definitely announce her engagement before the end of the year. The future husband will be older than her and will be a divorced man. She will give birth to a little baby in 1935. She will have two more years of good luck in the film industry. After this, she should retire.</p>
<p>So what about Clark Gable? Gable will definitely continue to get along with her current husband, Rex Bell. She will give birth to a son this year. This child will definitely become famous in the future. But from which aspect--screen, stage, or other?--it is not yet known.</p>
<p>Jean Harlow is also unlucky this year. There will be countless rumors slandering her this year. In Mr. Dareos's crystal ball, all the constellations are standing in opposition to Harlow. If she can get through this difficulty, then she will have two years of good luck in the future.</p>
<p>Kathleen Hepburn had good luck last year. She is not very popular this year. Although she will encounter many setbacks this year, she will eventually be able to climb up. She will feel a great pain in her personal life this year. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "The Youth of Blood"</h3>
<p>— Green Intentions</p>
<p>"The Youth of Blood" is a work by Tianyi Company that is completely opposite in personality and tone to "The Fire of Youth." Director Tang Jie is the first work to enter Tianyi Company, and it is much more advanced in technique than the "Mother and Child" directed by Mingxing. The whole play uses a heavy and slow tone, which can better increase the tragedy (although The Youth of Blood is not a complete tragedy) the achievement! There are also small cleverness, such as using cigarette ashes to show the father's advanced thoughts: using Ke Jianzi overturning the rice bucket to symbolize the unemployment of Ke Jian's father and son, etc. The application of symbolism is the same method as in "Drifting", which is a pity to become the old tune of Tianyi Company.</p>
<p>Tianyi Company's works also have a common shortcoming, that is, there are several sections of funny interspersed in each work! In "The Fire of Youth" it is the servant's strange face; now in "The Youth of Blood" it is the neighbor's movements and the bill collector's expression, which can most destroy the serious atmosphere of the plot. The producers set this up in order to welcome the general low-level taste, we really dare not agree. You must know that the funny interspersion can still be used slightly in a relaxed comedy, but in a bitter mood, it is greatly weakened the dramatic power when applied.</p>
<p>"The Youth of Blood" also dragged a big tail. This tail completely destroyed the tragic mood, and gave the audience an impression: the traitor was finally arrested - although this is very popular, the sympathy for the death of Ke Jian's parents has disappeared a lot! I think if the ending is changed to Ke Jian's police officer going to the cargo agency, he will be imprisoned for false accusations due to lack of evidence, then the structure will be completed as a complete tragedy, and the audience will strengthen their hatred for the traitor, so isn't it better?</p>
<h3>Review of "Life"</h3>
<p>— 克洛</p>
<p>In terms of technique, "Life" can be said to surpass all domestic films. The clear and beautiful photography, the reasonable and symmetrical setting, the flexible rotation of the lens, and the competent efforts of the actors are all impeccable and worthy of praise; especially this time Fei Mu used that novel directing technique - a slow melody, which made every audience member feel a heavy pressure in their hearts, and increased the power of the tragedy.</p>
<p>However, in terms of consciousness, I think it is not only not as good as "Spring Silkworms" and "Salt Tide", but has a great retrogression! Its central consciousness is the struggle between "good" and "evil", and to make people turn "evil" into "good", the power of education must be used. In this way, it has three shortcomings:</p>
<p>(1) There is no effort to describe the causes of "evil";</p>
<p>(2) It is simply a fantasy to want to use the power of education to make people turn "evil" into "good". Before the economic structure of the current society is improved, the so-called education is used by the privileged class as a tool to cultivate slaves. Not only can it not make people turn "evil" into "good", or it will produce a lot of evil people!</p>
<p>(3) Put all hope in the "future" and abandon the "reality"!</p>
<p>However, from a humanitarian point of view, this film has a lot of power to make people shed two tears of sympathy!</p>
<h3>My Opinion on "Life"</h3>
<p>— 越熙</p>
<p>The performance of "Life", although I dare not say that it has broken through all the achievements of Chinese films and has risen to the world status, but it is indeed a rare and praiseworthy film, especially from the technical point of view.</p>
<p>For example, using "ironing" to symbolize "life's tempering" is the playwright's extremely clever place. Of course, this is not easy to understand for people without artistic cultivation; but it is extremely unreasonable and stupid to deliberately lower the standards of art in order to cater to the psychology of low-level audiences. The film itself has the mission of improving the audience's artistic understanding.</p>
<p>For example, the picture shows the train proceeding, followed by Lin Ruan meeting. This saves a lot of unnecessary pictures, which is very commendable. Others, such as Fei Boqing drawing a gun and turning to prison, etc., are all very economical methods of the director, which are rare in Chinese films.</p>
<p>The clarity of light and the beauty of the picture are undoubtedly impeccable and satisfactory.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, I think Ruan Lingyu played the most realistic, the most effort, the most successful, and the most able to give the audience a deep impression. Fei Boqing's face is cunning, which is in line with the plot, and it is also considered a success. Zheng Junli failed to give the audience a deep impression, and we should forgive him for having too few opportunities to act. The rest of the actors can do their job well. In addition, our little star-Li Keng, who occupies the first seat of child actors-seems to have performed less well in this than in the past "City Night" and "Humanity" (omitted below)</p>
<h3>Review of "Life"</h3>
<p>— Xu Menggan</p>
<p>The current society is a deformed monster of all evils. Life is a portrayal and narration of a corner of this deformed society.</p>
<p>The protagonists in "Life"; one is a prostitute who has been transformed from a wild child and a maid, one is an elementary school teacher who is unwilling to be buried in chalk dust, and one is his wife who serves in a nursery. Under such circumstances, an unsurpassed and tragic tragedy was staged.</p>
<p>Regarding the director's technique, Fei Mu has made more progress than in "City Night". Although he does not explain everything about the characters in the play, he can use the kisses of the characters in the play to express them, and he can also narrate them in an orderly manner, which is his unique style.</p>
<p>Regarding the expressions of the actors. Then Wan Lingyu and Lin Chuchu are the most moving, Li Jian's innocence, Zheng Junli's handsome, are all commendable, and other actors can also do their best. As for photography, setting and other aspects, they are more advanced than before.</p>
<p>In short: in the embryonic stage of domestic films, "Life" is an ultra-special work. At the same time, we can also see that the Chinese film industry is making rapid progress, and is closely following foreign films.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Cinema Screens "The Lady Hunter"</h3>
<p>A comedy full of pleasant atmosphere</p>
<p>"The Lady Hunter" Facing The Music is a British musical comedy. The protagonist, Stan Rubio, is the younger brother of Lubelin, the funny waiter in "Xuan Palace Romance." His reputation in the European film industry is not inferior to that of Hollywood's Schiffrin. This arrogant child is completely composed of beautiful music, pleasant songs, and then the technology of film. Therefore, not only is the whole film funny and interesting; the songs included in it are very famous. In the "Faust", which has the longest history in the drama world, the song "Jewel Song" has also been moved to the film. This is very worthy of attention. And the actress who plays the female role is also a famous singer in Europe. The most gratifying thing is that under the director's clear description, each actor can grasp the unique personality of each character in the play. It is not easy for a comedy to have such good results. This film has been scheduled to be screened at the Great Shanghai Grand Theater starting today (7th).</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Christina Queen Chrina (6)</h3>
<p>— Hu Chen</p>
<p>Outside the inn, there was already the sound of people and horses making noise. She knew that the Spanish team had arrived. She watched them run into the inn one by one. She heard the imperial envoy ask the innkeeper for a room. She saw the innkeeper shaking his shoulders and apologizing repeatedly. The innkeeper looked at Christina, as if saying that she was the reason why he had no room to sleep in. So the imperial envoy quickly ran up to her. He took off his hat and bowed deeply. He said, "Sir, I have not had the pleasure of knowing you before, and I have been very rude. Now I am here to apologize." Christina smiled and said, "Sir, you don't need to be so humble. I earned that pound very happily." The young man said again, "Sir, this really makes me feel ashamed." Christina said, "Sir, there is no reason for that. I blame myself for wearing clothes that are too unlike yours." She looked at the rough sheepskin jacket she was wearing, "Isn't it the appearance of clothes that shows identity when we meet for the first time?" The man looked at her and said, "Sir, I hope you will allow me to get to know you better. Can you give me the honor of inviting you to dinner?" Christina said, "Having dinner together is possible, as long as you allow me to be the host. You are a guest from afar, and I must do my best to be a good host. I invite you to dinner today, will you give me the pleasure? And I have a deep concern for your country from which you came." The young imperial envoy declined on the one hand, and on the other hand, he asked her in surprise, "Do you know Spain?" Christina smiled and said, "I know Spain very well. I also want to learn some recent news from you. Does Floraskis have any new works of art? What has Gartelton been doing in Madrid recently?"</p>
<p>He was obviously surprised. He asked, "When were you last in Spain?" Christina said, "I have never been there, but I often think about it." The Spanish man's black eyes shone with light and said, "How strange! I am so happy to meet you, you will never know... Innkeeper!" The innkeeper came. The young man ordered, "Prepare the best dinner for this gentleman tonight." He then turned back to Christina and said, "Have you ever had homesickness?" Christina said apologetically, "I have never left the borders of Sweden." The young man said, "Then you will not know the taste of that loss. It is a kind of nostalgic mourning." Christina said slowly, "Do you know that even a person who has never been to a place can feel homesick?" This made him even more surprised. He said, "That is of course possible. This is the second time I have been disrespectful to you. You are a rare young man. Come," he took her hand and walked to the dining table.</p>
<p>On the other side, the innkeeper and his wife were discussing: the young man gave twenty taels, but the foreigner promised to give thirty taels, as long as he had a bed to sleep in. Now he watched Christina and the foreign young man talking very happily, so he came up. He smiled slyly without opening his mouth first and said, "I think you two gentlemen are very good friends. If possible, we can think of a way so that this gentleman can also have a place to stay." He said, pointing to the Spanish imperial envoy. (To be continued)</p>
