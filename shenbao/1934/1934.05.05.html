<h3 id="c65">日謀華南 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 延</p>
<p>駐華日使有吉。回國述職。連日與廣田及林銑十郎。商妥對華新策。擬改變靜觀主義。開始積極動作。此議甫起。華南局面。卽有追踵華北而驟形緊張之勢。最近關於華南情報。觸目驚心。不容漠視。甚尤重要者爲（一）臺灣總督府行將舉行對岸領事會議。（二）日本陸軍武官與臺漲總督府人員。考察福建内地。更有大批日人。暗測海岸地圖。防軍工事。及重要衝口地圖并暗中勾結臺灣浪民。及各地散匪。（三）日人密遣臺人深入潮汕内地。勾結流氓土劣。（四）日本陸軍遞信商工三省鑒於南洋貿易及軍事生要性。要求我國外部。准其設立航空綫。自福圖起航。經上海福州香港以至新加坡。（五）福建省政府委員兼馬江要港司令李世甲。掦露日人侵略華南陰謀。（六）沙面消息日人决於一二月間向華南有所動作。先謀奪馬尾厦門作海軍根據地。並擬藉口我欠債過鉅設委員會淸算。同時。東京興業公司總裁内田謁見汪兼外長希望整理舊債由此種。足見華南局勢之危殆。而尤以福建一省爲甚。猶憶閩變期内。有吉致我方公函。曾有「帝國政府在福建不單條約上有重大權益。而且居該地僑民甚衆」等語。預料其將來侵略理由。亦必借助於二十一條中之福建不割讓規定。而該省數萬日臺僑民雜處各地。又爲我方之心腹大患。</p>
<p>日本圖謀華南之最大理由。大槪不外三端。其一在增進商業利益其二在凖備對英作戰。其三在分化中國内部。</p>
<p>（甲）民國十九年以還。日本對華輸出。日呈衰徵。去年竟爲英美澳所掩。由第一位降至第四位。其間理由雖不一端。而我方抵貨運實爲主要原因之一。在全國對日經濟絕交聲中。華南空氣。稱最激昻。據專門學者研究所得。華南直接進口主要日貨之市塲。自九一八以後實巳喪失殆盡。重以去年夏季我國增修進口稅則後。卽爲日本工業命脈所繋之棉織品輸出貿易亦感覺嚴重之壓迫。不得不亟謀出路。據聞去年增稅後六月份至九月份各主要進口日貨總値。遠不及前年同期。華南較華北華中减少尤多。殆不下百分之八五·三云。今東京所唱之對華新策。旣以經濟關係之調整作先决條件對此情形。安能默爾而息。前者。日本外務省通商局巳通令國内外各地商人。務速加入「日華株式會社。」并擬在天津靑島上海漢口福州香港六處增設分社。發展各地貿易。此後自將積極推進。其最終目的厥在實現「日支滿經濟統制計劃。」圖謀華南。猶其整個計劃之一部分耳</p>
<p>（乙）華府會議廢止英日同盟後。英日關係。始終在貌合神離中去年四月間英政府通知廢除印日商約後。日人之反英論調盛極一時「日英必戰」聲浪。隨處可聞。此外。日人之南進政策。亦與英國殖民利益根本衝突故日英戰爭。實有其可能性。英人對日之作戰凖備計劃。除（一）整頓并嚴防太平洋及印度洋之各重要軍港及根據地。（二）嚴防蘇彝士運河使其軍艦直接通航無阻外。又須（三）在中國沿海口岸設定飛機及潛水艇根據地。反之。日本欲抵抗英軍之攻撃。亦必先侵奪華商爲根據地而後可。福建與臺灣間之距離平均不過二百五十公里。一旦爲英人空軍所佔有。則臺灣不得不暴露於集團的空襲威脅之下。若由此與在南方之馬尼拉空軍互相聯絡而進襲臺灣更足使日人陷於萬分狼狽之境地。日本素以獨覇西太平洋爲念其於英人經營新加坡港。旣與暹羅密商。在加萊地峽開鑿運河以孤其勢矣對此南華海岸線之爭奪。寗有不未雨綢繆者。但不知我當局亦曾措意及之否耳</p>
<p>（丙）此後日本對華。當益以分化交涉對象爲骨幹圖謀華南卽所以破壞我方之團結。其操縱拉擺之私。日人雖口口聲希望中國統一實則中國統一。最其所忌。考日人過去之鬼蜮伎倆。層出不窮今後之陰謀野心更不知伊於胡底所望南華當局勿爲威迫。更勿爲利誘。認淸公敵面目而嚴爲之防也可。</p>

<p>（東京）齋藤内閣組織後第三屆之地方長官會議、於今日上午十時半在首相官邸開第一日會議、齋藤首相以下各大臣均出席、首相奉誦數語後、高橋藏相及山本内相作財政行政及地方問題之演說、正午停會、首相宴各知事於官邸、下午續開、（四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田外相本日在地方長官會議席上演說、略謂近代外交當不僅勵於外交機關之交涉、其於國民互相接觸之處、關係甚大、深望對於加以此點留意、其次則爲日本之主張、須竭力與各國增進其親善友誼、同時對於日本在東亞之使命、亦不得一日本或忘、所謂日本之使命、卽日本在東亞和平上之安定力也、關於維持和平典秩序、其意義則在東亞當與其他各國共同負擔、此項重大使命而見諸實行之謂也、而此項使命之自覺、乃爲日本保持大國資格之根本原因、日本固希望中國得以保全及其統一繁榮、但徒恃外部自己本位之援助行動、亦未能達到目的、何况尙有第三者對於中日關係發生糾紛之際、或於東亞之和平維持上行使反動之時、則日本斷難默認、至最近中日兩國之關係、幸而中國巳漸次有了解日本眞意之傾向、似乎兩國關係現巳進至基礎理解之佳境、亦可認爲滿足之現象云、</p>
<p>外相復談及通商問題、然後結論如左、總之、吾人自今以後、難關仍復不少、蓋國家民族處於發展向上之情勢下、種種難關乃爲當然之遭遇、吾人應有所覺悟者也、但國民無論對於任何時期、均應以極其謙恭之態度以處事、要之、外交乃國力之反映、須期待國民精神旺盛、上下一心、努力從事、以圖增進國力、則爲其基本條件也云云、（四日日聯電）</p>

<p>推進諸策、翼各員予以恊力、第一須安定社會人心、取締左右兩派之暴行爲、但左派思想雖似巳全滅、然前途尙有禍源、右派亦借口愛國圖作軌外、故須特别注意此二事、（二）善運用地方財政、革新行政、以刷新空氣、又近時敎育腐敗不堪、不穩思想之原因、須謀根本芟除發揮日本精神、（三）使農民安分營生、中央亦切實實行各項農林政策、（四）擁護僞滿國爲前提、與各國保持親善關係、</p>

<p>切實言之、此時本無取乎亟制憲、蓋就憲法之「用」而言」憲法本爲一歷史的產物、非任意創造、卽可推行、就憲法「體」而方則吾國此時、實早巳有憲法、如建國大綱、如國府組織法、如中華民國訓政時期約法、如訓政綱領、其著例也誠使舉國上下、均有守法信法之精神與毅力、則吾國此時、實早巳臻於憲政之境、且近世憲政典刑之邦、若英若法、其憲章均係片斷零星、陸逐公布、英國憲章、係集一二一五年之大憲章、一六二八年之權利請願書、一六七九年之人身保護法、一六八八年之權利宣言、一七零零年之皇位繼承法、一九一一年之議會法、一九一八年之國民參政法、曁一九二八年之修正案而成、卽法國憲法、亦僅係一八七五年二月二十四日參議院組織法（此法第一至第七條、巳由一八八四年十二月九日法律廢止）二月二十五日政權組織法、七月十六日公權規定法八月二日參議員選舉法、十一月三十日衆議員選舉法、一八七九年七月二十二日巴黎建都法、一八八四年十二月九日修正參議員衆議員選舉法、一八八五年六月十六日修正選舉法、一八八七年十二月二十六日國會議員不得兼職法、一八八九年七月十七日候選人法、一八九五年七月二日國會議員之乓役義務法、一九零二年制止選舉舞弊法、曁一九零三年四月二日、一九零八年調二月十七日、一九一四年三月二十三日、三月三十一日、一九一八年一月五日、一九一九年十月十七日、一九二六年八月十日、一九二七年七月十日七月二十一日、一九二八年十二月三十日、諸種條欵之集成、故憲法無取形式、但求「信」「守」、法家所謂「惡法勝於無法」、殆深識法治要旨之言也、</p>
<p>然則、吾人將解散憲法起草委員會而盡毁今日巳成之憲草乎、是又不可、且此種不近事實之高十、當爲眞能平心論政者所不取、就事論事、今日旣有憲草、則唯有求其不蹈以往覆轍、而能施行有效而巳、故愚以爲今日憲政問題之重心、尙不在憲法條文之應如何完美、而惟在公布施行一端、究應如何規定、庶能得一兩全之道巳耳、查建國大綱、總理關於憲法公布之規定十分鄭重、一則曰、「憲法草案當本於建國大綱、及訓政憲政兩時期之成績、由立法院議訂、隨時宣傳於民衆、以備到時采擇施行、」（大綱二十二條再則曰、「全國有過半數省分達至憲政時期、卽全省之地方自治完全成立時期、則開國民大會、决定憲法而頒布之」、（大綱二十三條）是則憲法頒布之最大前提、爲地方自治之完成、而地方自治之完成、一則須「全縣人口調查淸楚、全縣土地測量完竣、全縣警辦理妥善四境縱横之道路修築成功、而其人民曾受四權使用之訓練、而完畢其國民之義務、誓行革命之主義者、得選舉縣官以執行一縣之政事、得選舉議員、以議立一縣之法律、始成爲一完全自治之縣」、（大綱第八條）二則「其國民有直接選舉官員之權、有直接罷免官員之權有直接創制法律之權、有直接複决法律之權」、（大綱第九條）復次、决定憲法之機關爲國民大會而國民大會代表之選舉、則須俟「每縣地方自治政府成立之後」、（大綱十四條）國与大會之召開、又須俟「全國有過半數省分達至憲政時期」、（大綱第二十三條）吾國現在訓政尙未完成、地方自治毫無成績、則此時遽行公布憲法、自有拔苗助長之危險、須知總理關於建國程序之劃分、自有其豐富的經騐、遠大的目光以及精深的識力、蓋實現憲政、非可徒托空言、亦非可期諸朝夕、必使民權竟充分發展始能有穩固不移、千秋萬世的憲政基礎、（參看拙著現代政治槪觀八六－八七頁）此種建國原理、非特適合吾國國情、且又可供世界各國憲政改造之借鐵、吾人固未可妄自菲薄、　等以進、自亂建國之步驟也、（未完）</p>

<p>（一續）</p>
<p>－答王仁堪君－</p>
<p>王君來信所提出的幾點，幾乎包括了中國新文學運動的全面，如果要詳確的回答，非有十萬言的大著不可。現在，我們爲本欄篇幅所限制，觀點雖力求正確，發揮容有未盡。這一點，是要預先請王君及一切讀者原諒的。</p>
<p>要明白「五四運動」在文學上的成就，必先要明白「五四運動」發生的社會的意義。有些「五四」時代的遺老們，常常誇說「五四」運動是由「新文學運動」所發動起來的。這種說法，不僅是爲了抬高他們自巳的身價，有意顚倒因果關係，且足以障礙我們對于「五四運動」的根本認識「五四運動」、顯明地是新興民族資產階級的反帝反封建的運動。第一次世界大戰的結果，使歐洲各帝國主義一時無暇顧及這次殖民地·而給予民族資產階級以相當發展的機會。這一來一方面喚起了一部份前進資產階級智識份子的自覺，另一方面，却威脅着新興的日本資本帝國主義，使它不能不乘機向中國進一步的進攻！提出滅亡中國的二十一條；封建軍閥官僚投降了「五四運動」便在這些對立的淸形下必然地暴發。社會基礎有了動搖，上層建築才發生動搖。雖然所謂新文化運動往往先于實際運動具體地表現出來，雖然文化運動的發展，也足以促成實際運動的發展，但法國大革命的成功，並不全賴盧梭的「返到自然」的呼聲，而是由于法國資產階級本身力量之成長和强固。以這來例證一五四運動」，我們不能說「五四運動一是由「新文化運動」所發動，我們倒應說「新文化運動」是經過「五四運動一而展開。如果我們不把握這一點，不從階級的觀點出發去認識「五四運動」的意義，認識「五四運動」與「新文化運動」的相互關係，我們是無由解决以下的問題的。</p>
<p>「五四運動」在文學上到底成就了些什麽呢？這問題，如果我們更具體地回答，我們可以說，只提出了問題，而完全没有解决問題，也就是說，是没有成就的。如某先生之所謂「上了成功之路」所謂「建立」，是一種自欺欺人的誇大，用來掩飾自身的逃避，投降，跑回「整理國故」的老家去的那種軟弱無力的缺陷。這原因，當然不怪某先生及同類的智識份子，而是决定于他們的階級的命運。中國的民族資產階級，一部份爲資本帝國主義所培養，一部份爲土著軍閥官僚所蛻化。他們生成具有買辦性和封建性，雖然他門爲了本階級的利益，曾一度在「五四運動」中伸出了他們的乎，但他們無可掩飾的怯弱，使他們不能持久，無力作殊死戰。一到鬥爭尖銳，對于他們自身的利益發生危害時，他們便不惜回到他們的舊主人的懐裏去，甘作奴隸了。這反映到文學運動上，自然不能例外。我們看它的成就吧：這運動，一開始，其本身卽暴露出許多根本的缺陷。第一，作爲道運動的領導者的資產階級的智識分子，並没有堅决的自信心，只把這運動當作一種「嘗試」，這在許多先生當時的言論中，常常可以看到。因此，他們旣看不到他們的前途，也不願走上他們的前途，只要「之乎者也」換了「的麽呢嗎」就算滿足了。第二，只具運動的形式而没有充實運動的内容。就白話文來說，這固然是民族資產階級在實現「科學」和「德謨克拉西」的兩大要求下，一種衝錄的武器。無疑的其本身卽具有濃厚的反帝反封建的意義，但當時的領導者，只把問題限于白話文與古文的利弊的討論，而不能附以更重要的社會的目的意識，致使完全凝滯在形式上面，「的麽呢嗎」儘管普遍地使用，而含有鬥爭性的文學作品，終不可得。這兩個缺點，在考察當時文學運動的成就上，是不能不特别提出的。</p>
<p>「五四運動」的結果，使新文學運動！或者白話文運動，深入了小資產階級的學生和小市民層，擴大了新文學運動的影響這是事實，但同時五四運動的結果，更暴露了那些上層階級的知識份子的醜態，于是分化，動搖，而結束了他們這一階段的文學運動壽命。他們之中，有些進步的份子，是再進一步在政治上採取直接行動，這不消說。另一部份却馴服地退回了老家去，這就是如某先生之流的「整理國故」。「整理國故」，决不能與蘇聯的接受文學遺產並論。蘇聯之提出接受文學遺產，是因爲新文學的社會基礎巳極其强固，而是站在使這新興文學達到最高峯的觀點出發的，否則他們爲什麽在第一次五年計劃未完成以前不提出這問題來呢？某先生之流，顯明的是在向對建文學投降，避開現實的文學鬥爭而躱進牛角尖襄去。考證紅樓夢，瞎捧醒世因緣，不僅于新文學無補，實際上，適足爲虎作倀，有意無意替封建文學鴛鴦蝴蝶派盡了義務的宜傳。這一部智識份子「五四運動」後，早巳離開了新文學運動的陣營的。他們己被時代掩埋了。</p>
<p>另外，能够作爲我們考　的對象的只有那些在藝術的皇宮裏面徘徊着的中立的一羣。（未完）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>從上面這　問答上看來，讀者也許要問，那末要在滿淸政府統治下當一個鐵路官員，究竟是憑什麽資格的呢？答復是非常的簡單。只要能用錢買，就是够資格了！至於他們怎樣能幹下去，那只要有　活的手段，便行了·　如像我的兄弟勛齡，他是充着一個鐵路監督：但是他所監督的是什麽事情呢？不但我不知道，連他自己也不知道！他之所以能得到這個位置的緣故，僅僅乎因爲他是一個在法國某某　軍學校畢業的留學生而巳！</p>
<p>表面上看來，皇太后不但時常受伊的朝臣的朦蔽，就是關於　路部份的官員，似乎也欺騙得伊很　害。其實伊何嘗不知道？伊不過佯若不聞吧了！因爲這些人對於伊，也像宮中所有的一切繁文縟禮一樣的不可救藥：乃是伊所不得不忍受的。但是我可以下一個斷語，憑我在宮中所得的經騐而言，皇太后對於伊的臣下的種種特性，如自大，虚榮，作僞等等，可說是無一不知道，而且是知道得十分的確切！</p>
<p>當我們在看伊和孟福祥說話的時候，我們相信伊那時的心上，祇有兩個念頭：一個念頭是把他攆出去，永遠不要再見他：一個念頭是當着他的面笑他。可是伊也知道如其眞把孟福祥攆走了，後來接替他的，也許更加的不堪。那末笑他吧？·········也不行！因爲皇太后的尊嚴又是伊所不能不維持的！</p>
<p>在車子上，每天雖然不設朝，似乎是休假的日子；但是一切的禮儀，却還得照舊維持。祗有我們這些充任女官的比較還幸運一些。因爲我們如果發現了什麽可笑的事情，心上想笑的話，只須回到我們自己的一輛車上去，就可以大笑而特笑了！（二六）</p>

<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>石梁龍湫石門洞三處瀑布，是挺有名的，袁子才的浙西三瀑布記，形容得有聲有色，可惜這三處地方交通不便，不容易去遊賞。這回五省交通周覽會，計畫的第一綫，就把這些勝地包括在内。事前先組織一個采訪隊，中間文學家畫家攝影家新聞記者什麽都有，預備編成一本遊覽指南給參加周覽者一點參考。我友陳子淸就是應召而往的一人，前天還來了，他說：險些兒把性命送掉，因爲他是個畫家，往往别具眼光，看到一處勝境，便提筆速寫，忘其所以，不顧脚下的險境，在龍湫的一個山崖上，給靑泥苔一滑，身體就弔了下去，下面是不測深淵，跌下去必成肉餅，幸虧有一個轎夫跟在身邊，立刻抓住，總算没有成了「失足恨」。可是他在這一行，得到的山水勝槪，足以使他的畫藝增進了不少天趣。所以他要把胸中邱　，寫成紙上雲烟，和同學吳湖帆在上海積極的賣畫，絕對的商業化，力守信約，全無名士派頭。他們有一種宏願，要把中國的好山水，和好畫，黏成一片，普及到民衆去，這種思想，可算得新透了罷。</p>
<p>，子淸又說，浙西的公路建設，非常努力，至今還有二千多人在工作着，都是從山裏硬開出路來，工程當然不小。倘然全國都像這們的開發，前途是很有希望的。許多山谷中間，以方巖最爲奇特，方弗是無數立方體的石塊疊成的，這是别處所没有的罷。</p>

<p>第二十八回　巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕　殷勤兩問疾誤會投書</p>
<p>他回得家來，哥嫂也就由城裏坐汽車回來了，也就走到上房去，和兄嫂敷衍了兩句，吃晚飯時，勉强吃了半碗飯，就悄悄的回到書房去，撑了頭在桌子邊坐着，偷眼向　子外面看看，並没有人經過，這就在身上摸索了一陣，摸出一方雪絲手絹來。這手絹角上，挑了兩朶小桂花，三片緣葉子，這乃是楊桂枝名字的縮小，表示是他私有的物件的。於是手拿了絲絹，翻來覆去的看了兩遍，又在鼻子尖上聞了幾遍，覺得香氣透鼻，讓人心裏發生一種快感。因爲心裏很痛快，所以揑住那手絹，只管出神。他玩味着這手絹到手的經過，記得是當自己不敢再看桂枝的時候，桂枝在懐裏掏出這方手絹來，在臉上輕輕的抺了兩下，於是不大留心的樣子，左手拿回手絹，向左脇下插進去。但是衣服的襟縫，都在右邊的，左邊如何插得下去？所以插了幾下，那手絹依然還在手上。好像他全副精神，都注意着在台上，所以自己身上的事，却完全不知道。過久了，他的手，不知怎樣疏了神，將手絹落在椅靠上，就向前看着去了。自己原不敢去動他的私有物，但是直等把戲看完了，他也不理會這條手絹。在他起身之後，這就把手絹拿到手上來了。這樣看起來，他或者是有心把手絹私遞給我的，也未可料，若不收起來，却是辜負他一番好意了。積之坐在書房裏，層層的推想，越想便覺得越是桂枝情厚。本來，他巳經出嫁了，而且公公待他十分的仁厚，他如何能在這個時候，表示二心？我心裏怎樣難受，他大槪也知道，所以在萬般無奈之中，用這方手絹來安慰我。其實他不安慰我還好一點，這樣的一安慰我，更讓我墜入情海去了。（三七七）</p>
<p>副不大理會的眼光，似在說你「窮相！」反之，入席愈遲，反證出你應酬之多，因而你身價也就愈高。假使你能「席不暇暖」地呷上口酒就起身告辭，說些所以不得不失陪的理由是在應酬委實太多的抱歉話之後，裝出很怱忙地溜之大吉。於是你的舉止豪爽和交遊廣闊一類的「遺愛」定能「其味津津」地留在「大圓桌上」給「九位仁兄」咀嚼，贊歎。</p>
<p>中國人處在這般虚僞的社會環境下，那裏談得上「守時！」何况他們所戴的手錶，大都各自爲政地指在各個不同的時刻，「時」之不凖，何有於「守」！因此我又想起一件「來路貨」的笑話。</p>
<p>西人某邀請一位曾經失過一次約的朋友。在過了約定時刻十分鐘之後·他那朋友纔意態自若地姗姗而來，他很　氣的責問他的朋友爲何老不守時，後者顯露手錶給他瞧，意在表示不服。經過一度辯論和確實核對之後，後者的手錶被證明因彈簧鬆弛，有欠凖確。於是他就很嚴重地說道：「朋友，你願意保留我們的友誼呢？還是願意保留你這隻錶！」　　爲了錶的問題竟牽涉到友誼，眞正笑死中國人」</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>鹹鴨蛋是一種極普通的食物，在這春夏二季，　　晨間佐粥，尤爲佳品。記得有一個笑話：「　子吃了鹹鴨蛋，莫知其所以然，有一天嘗到　　了鹹鴨，纔恍然大悟道：原來鹹鴨蛋是鹹鴨所生的。」</p>
<p>鹹鴨蛋高郵所製的爲最有名，俗呌高郵蛋。這種蛋剖開來，紅似琥珀，且有油汁流出，其味腴美，無可倫比。可是置久了，紅的變而爲黑，别有一種氣息，但是也有許多人却喜歡吃黑黃蛋的。更天穿玄色香雲紗衫褲，外罩白長衫的，也稱黑黃蛋，比喩酷肖。</p>
<p>杜製鹹鴨蛋法，把歲尾鹹魚肉的滷汁，拌入稻草灰中，搗之匀和，然後塗在洗凈的鮮鴨蛋上，約一星期後，便可取食。也有把沸鹽水泡河沙塗蛋的，但是總没有那鹹魚肉的滷汁和稻草灰的腴美。海上人家在都燒煤，有用煤屑灰　代替，那更不如河沙了。</p>
<p>鹹鴨蛋巳有悠久的歷史，容齋續筆：「玉篇唐韻釋杬字云：木名，出豫章，前汁，藏果及卵不壞。異物志云：杬子音元，鹽鴨子也，以其杬木皮汁和鹽漬之。今吾鄉處處有此，乃如蒼耳益母　幹，不純是木，小人爭鬥者，取其葉挼擦皮　，輒作赤腫，如被傷以誣賴其敵。至藏鴨卵，則又以染其外，便若赭色云。」</p>
<h3 id="c223">記豬血菌 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 孫宗棠</p>
<p>無鍚惠泉山，九峯高峙，太湖環繞，占泉石臺榭之勝。山中出產豬血菌一種，淸香鮮嫩，爲野　山肴中之别具風格者；惜外間知者甚尠，不獲嘗此異味。</p>
<p>豬血菌爲一種菌類，色紫殷如血，無毒，故有斯名。每歲四月及九月中，產生於惠麓松柴之間，山下鄉民，携筠籃採之，番佛一尊，祇購斤餘，價格殊貴。</p>
<p>豬血菌以鮮竹筍豆　同煮，其味鮮美，朶順稱决。此項菜肴，推惠山寄暢圜中附設之某菜館烹飪最佳。此圜爲秦姓所有，淸乾隆帝曾駐蹕於是。環惠山而圜，波光嵐影，長松偃蓋，飛閣流丹，翼然竦峙。如欲嘗此山肴，可至該圜，則於飽嘗惠山特產之外；並可一覽名圜風物，亦一樂也。</p>
<p>以豬血菌與上好秋油同煮，盛於磁缸内，其油可醃豆腐，淸晨以爲粥肴，别具風味，較之蝦子醬油，又勝一格。豬血菌冲湯食之，味極雋腴，鍚邑各寺院素筵中，均視此爲席上珍品。</p>
<p>又豬血菌和豆腐衣麵筋鮮筍煮之亦可。麵筋係無鍚特產，含維他命甚富，食之於人身營養上頗有裨益。</p>
<p>要之，豬血菌祇可與素物同煮，自具異味。如與葷肴烹煮，則味同嚼蠟矣。</p>

<h3 id="c266">變壓器電壓在負荷時測定法 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>修理家與實騐家每欲計算電源變壓器在某負荷下的電壓幾何？此誠一易事「稍知初步算術的智識者，能用下列簡單的公式解之。</p>
<p>（一）E=e-cRRI+RE爲變壓器在負荷RI下的電壓。</p>
<p>R爲副圈的交流總感廻阻。（A·CImpedance）</p>
<p>e爲變壓器在無負荷時的電壓。</p>
<p>Ri爲負荷的交流總感廻阻。</p>
<p>第一圖AB</p>
<p>第二圖VA</p>
<p>此公式如何解之？請視第一圖，e値由未負荷時在AB點上測得620伏脫，R値用歐姆表量得直流耗阻400歐姆，（雖此値欲在交流六十循環測之，然其差數此値及交流總感廻阻相差微幾，此錯誤點無甚影響）。耗阻ＲＩ爲分壓器，阻力爲６·０００歐姆，則當負荷６－０００歐姆時的變壓器電壓應爲若干。</p>
<p>解：將測得的値代入，則算出的結果約３００伏脫。</p>
<p>應用此法可測算整流中的電流與各種眞空管上的屏極回路。</p>
<p>對於降低變壓器，其線圈耗阻亦能用歐姆表精確測定之。（大電力變壓器用惠斯登橋（ＷｈｅａｓｔｏｎｅＢｒｉｄｇｅ）測其抵電阻）公式如下：</p>
<p>（２）Ｒ＝ｅＥＩＩ爲電流，單位用安培。　　	例：某收音機有眞空管四只，其絲極電流需四安培。如第二圖所示，當用眞空管六只，需電流六安培時，其絲極電壓降落後爲若干？</p>
<p>解：當ｅ未負荷時的電壓２·７伏脫，Ｅ負荷時的電壓２·２５伏脫，此數値代入下列公式算得：</p>
<p>Ｒ＝２·７２·２５·４５４＝０·１１２歐姆　　旣得Ｒ後，六安培時降壓後應爲：（３）ＥＩＥＲＥ＝２·７（６Ｘ０·１１２）Ｅ＝２·０３伏脫</p>
<h3 id="c267">天線交連的改進法 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 明裏</p>
<p>高週率放大級的調整電容器，如欲使成爲連軸調整，第一個難題，卽如何可使第一高放級的調整綫路，不受天綫電路交連的影響，而變更其波長範；圍。圖一Ａ示最簡單的調整線路，其波長可完全依綫圈ＬＩ之誘導率和分佈電容量及電容器ＣＩ之最大和最小電容量，劃一曲綫如圖二Ａ，今另以一綫圈Ｌ２以代普通高週率變壓器的初級，使與ＬＩ相交連（圖一Ｂ），若Ｌ２爲開路，則ＣＩ的波長曲綫，自全無變異，在實際綫路中，所有各高放級，除第一級外，Ｌ２均與前級高放管的屏和簾栅相跨接（圖ｌＣ），此時Ｌ２及其附屬綫路對於ＬＩ發生效應，使ＬＩ的誘導率增加，而ＣＩ的</p>
<p>波長曲綫，亦變爲圖二Ｂ，今第一高放</p>
<p>級旣欲與之成連軸調整，其波長曲綫，自非與Ｂ符合不可。</p>
<p>如將天綫連接在此同樣的初級圈Ｌ２上，因天綫誘導率及電容量併入初級綫路，故增加Ｌ誘導率的效應更甚，圖二ＣＤＥ三曲綫，表示短，中，長三種天綫連接後，Ｃ１的波長曲綫。�</p>
<p>由此觀之，第一高放級的Ｌ２，自不能與他級的Ｌ２同樣大小，故此高週率變壓器必須特殊設計，但卽使設計妥善後，亦僅能適用於某種長度的天綫，爲免除此種困難起見，Ｌ２可採用與他級同式者，惟另以一電容Ｃ３與之並接（圖ＬＥ），校配此電容器，使與高放管屏，簾栅的極間電容量相等，如此則其波長曲綫仍可與（圖二Ｂ）一致。�</p>
<p>此綫路尙需串聯一綫圈Ｌ３（圖一Ｅ），使可與天綫相交連，並須减少Ｃ３之電容量，以保持此綫路原有的特性，設天綫藉Ｌ４交連至Ｌ３（圖一Ｇ），因誘導率的變異，自一綫路傳至另一綫路必逐漸减弱，故雖Ｌ４之變異極大，ＬＩ所受之影響極弱，實騐結果，此綫路如能再將交連疏密，配合適富，卽天綫無論爲何種長度，Ｃ的波長曲綫不變，總與圖二Ｂ相符合，最完善的綫路，當推圖一Ｈ，因其巳將各綫圈，配合適宜，Ｃ３可省去，綫圈Ｌ３與地綫間的電容量巳足够替代之。�</p>
<p>上述之天綫交連法，其優點有三，</p>
<p>（一）可使第一高放級的電容器與其他各級成極完善連軸調整。</p>
<p>（二）所有各高週率變壓器的構造，可完全一樣，</p>
<p>（三）僅須變更天綫的交連度，卽可控制音量的强弱。</p>
<h3 id="c268">超短波用極小型眞空管之出現 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 博淸</p>
<p>從來以眞空管接收超短波時，其限度約爲五公尺，於此以上，雖勉强可利用電子振動等之特殊方法，然動作均不安定，感度亦頗不良，故於實用上有諸多不便之處。但邇來依據最新之研究，得知如能設法使兩極間，常保持一定之比率，則其形狀無論如何縮小，而其特性决不稍變。其小約爲現型之十分之一者，雖至○·五公尺之超高週率，亦能確切使用，且實際亦曾被試作過。</p>
<p>此二種，試作品，乃爲傍熱型三極管及簾栅極四極管，而電極間之間隔，實以一○○○分之一爲單位，故其狭小之程度，實可驚異。茲將其特性列舉於下：</p>
<p>三極管：</p>
<p>屏極電莊···６７·５Ｖ負栅電莊···２Ｖ屏極電流··ｍＡ·屏極耗阻···９５０００互導····１５５ｕＡ／Ｖ放大率····１４·７</p>

<p>我們設計收音機的時候，如果想省却幾個眞空管，大都趨之於來復式的一途，但來復式成績雖佳，製造及排列上常發生很多的困難，往往没有良好的結果·下面一張綫路檢波由礦石担任，其輸出（礦石輸出）加諸第一只眞空管的控制栅放大後再藉屏栅圈的交連回輸入檢波回路；同時它們簾栅極還作第一級低放用途：形式上似乎也是來復式，但製造上决不致有任何難點，並且面板上祗有一只電容器和活動綫圈，控制亦不見繁複。</p>
<p>線圈Ｌ是初級，和Ｌ１接連以增加感應度，Ｌ２是回授圈，都繞在蛛網板上初級約十圈（用短天線者須增多，」次級六七十圈，須試騐而定，必要時可在Ｘ處加一分線　配合，再生四十圈巳够：礦石固定活動都可以；其丙電阻Ｒ５及Ｒ３數値必須十分凖確，否則易致失眞，乙</p>
<p>電用一三五伏時可放揚聲器；傍路電容器Ｃ６千萬不可省掉，其餘數値圖中均有注明，茲不復贅。</p>

<p>複作用眞空管除半解君所述外，尙有２９Ｉ，２９３，２９５－１９，５３，７９，８５和新式眞空管６Ｆ７－２Ａ７，等。並且２Ａ７５７，６Ａ７，ＩＡ６等眞空管亦能兼司兩種作用，此複作用眞空管大致爲二管合併，取其節省地位，不易失眞，取同一屏電壓，而輸出可得二倍或二倍以上之成音電工率。如</p>
<p>第一圖所示爲最簡單之複式眞空管，營内包含二個三極管，ＰＧ爲輸入三極管，ＰＩＧｒ爲輸出三極管，燈絲是兩用的此管作一管機，以輸入部作檢波，輸出作低放，效力可與二個三極管相同。２９ｒ，２９３，２９５等本刊巳有記載，５３，７９等惟多</p>

<p>— 飛利浦社來稿</p>
<p>（二）初期的發達：無綫電眞空管之專門技術，進步極速。究其原因，應歸功於各國業餘家之熱誠的研究，及陸海軍擴充之關係。且因世人須要物美而價廉之收音機，故專門技術之發展因之促進，而眞空管之製造亦日臻完善。</p>
<p>同時飛利浦所出品的Ｄ號式管，無疑的，是個很大的成就，雖其收音較弱，然亦無妨於事。一方極笨重之Ｂ電池又因低眞空管及雙栅管之出現巳盡量减輕，所嫌美中不足者此時每管尙須費○·五安培之大電流也。若一座四燈機，日開五小時，則在數日内大容量之電池巳盡爲所消耗，殊不經濟也。</p>
<p>因此微熱管始應時代之需要而產生。凡前此在舊式眞空管中所用之鎢燈絲幾盡爲淘汰，而代之以塗養化鋇之燈絲。蓋養化鋇在低温度可發射較多量之電子，故在此新式眞空管所消耗之電流爲量極小，約爲舊式眞空管所消耗電流之百分之一。微熱管之製造始於一九二三年（ＡＩ０６及Ａ３０６）·數年後高壓眞空管始發現於市塲，以與低壓管相競爭，而使科學家集中於特種眞空管之設計（待續）。</p>

<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>科學的各種發明在二十世紀之中恐怕要算無綫電最値得驚奇了罷？你想，日日夜夜，不曉得有成千成萬的電台發出的電波交錯的穿過我們的身體，但是我們却一些都感覺不到。音樂，言語，求救的Ｓ·Ｏ·Ｓ·符號，警報等等在一日二十四小時之内不時的侵入你的身體，這不够驚奇嗎？這些全世界成千成萬形形色色的電波，你如果用一隻很靈敏的收音機便可以都感覺到了。至於無綫電波的本身，除非我們是專門家，否則我們是不大了解的。其實呢無綫電波是和光波一類的。譬如，光波的速率是每秒一八六○○○哩，電波也一樣。不過光波是我們視感器官所能感覺得到的·而電波則須用特殊的感覺裝置罷了。</p>
<p>經世界的工師家學者繼續不斷的研究·奇蹟層出不窮，當ＨｅｉｎｒｉｃｈＨｅｒｔｚ</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>最初實騐感應團和火花間𨻶的時候，所發生的電波，好像是一塊石子擲在水裏一樣，產生一些些水波，轉瞬卽逝。過了幾年，當眞空管發明的時候，滿幅波就出現了。其後科學家就利用牠，把另外一種週率的電波（例如成音週率）加上去，就成功了調幅的作用。這好比一個軟木塞浮在水波上一樣，水托着木塞，載沉載浮，遠播出去。於是無綫電話便產生了。</p>
<p>以後美國的工程師又因爲在横渡大西洋的無綫電話裏有不能守秘密的弊病，於是想出了呌做ｉｎｖｅｒｔｅｄｏｒｃｃｒａｍｂｌｅｄ，ｓｐｅｅｃｈ的法子。這法子的原理在這短短的篇幅裏不能說明，不過大槪的講是利兩隻振盪器同時一齊發出兩種不同的週率罷了。所以在收音機裏須用一種特殊的裝置，否則收得的不過是些糢糢糊糊的聲音而巳。</p>
<p>這些還不算希奇呢！最希奇的，據歐洲方面最近的消息，說巳經有人發明了一種方法，能够以兩個不同的節目，由同一電台，用同一週率，在同一時間以内廣播出來，而可以一些不相混雜。同時美國ＬｕｍｂｉａＢｒｏａｄｃａｓｔｉｎｇＳｔａｆｉｏｎ的工程師也巳實騐成功，用一種週率同時播視電視和言語。不過收音機也須有特殊的裝置，牠的原理不過是兩種不同的節目，在發射機裏用一隻本地振盪器使行忽開忽關的工作。換言之，就是用一隻Ｐａｒａｌｙｚｉｎｇｇｒｉｄｂｉａｓ從兩隻不同的低週率放大器交連到同一的調幅器裏而巳。自從這種驚奇的發現之後，電台播音的機會可以增加一倍了。然而祗能增加一倍嗎？將來恐怕還不止呢。在有綫電報裏，不是有呌數重電信機（Ｍｕｌｔｐｌｅｘｒｅｇｒａｐｂｙ）的方法嗎。牠同時可以發八份電信之多。那末，在無綫電方面，如再努力下去，將來不要說八份，恐怕一打的電信都可以同時在同一的</p>
<p>週率之下播送出去呢。上海目下烏烟瘴氣的播送情形恐怕也可以從此得到一個解救辦法罷！</p>
<h3 id="c277">一隻眞空管放揚聲器的收音機 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>這只收音機僅用一眞空管而能放揚聲器，並且所發聲音亦不可謂輕。收音穩定，調節簡單是它的特點。製造及使用均無若何困難。製造時稍加注意，决不致失敗。</p>
<p>輸出這收音機的綫路是弗利惠靈氏式超等再生式（Ｆｌｅｗｅｌｌｉｎｇｓｓｕｐｅｒｒｅｇｅｎｒｅａｌｉｖｅ）用一只三三號五極强放眞空管爲檢波。其綫路如附圖，另件數値如下：</p>
<p>ＣＩ○○○五變量電容器。Ｃ２Ｃ５○○○二五　法拉特雲母固定電容器。</p>
<p>Ｃ３Ｃ４○○六　法拉特雲母固定電容器。</p>

<p>眞空管３３號。（８３號及４７號亦可用）</p>
<p>Ａ電，二弗打。Ｂ電九十至一百三十五弗打。</p>
<p>製好後若不靈，可將Ｗ２之二綫端換接試之。此機不必用地綫，若欲用地綫，則照圖中虚綫所示者接之。在揚聲器之接綫釘處，加接一只，○○○一　法拉特之固定電容器有時可增進成績，可以一試。（接法如圖中虚綫所示）</p>
<p>此機中之固定電容器，其數値均須照所注明者，且均應用雲母絕緣者，以免减損再生力。所用之揚聲器其誘導迥阻應用較高者，則成績必佳。所用天綫有七十五英尺巳足，較此再長，或致减</p>

<p>我人都知道Ｂ類放大的輸出極强，所以用在末級放大很爲相宜，至於用在檢波級的却還少見，其原因不外是普通收音機如需有很高的聲浪大都多向低放段着想；並且要用二隻眞空管事實上也很困難，但現在雙　管出現後，不妨來試騐一下，下面是一張Ｂ類檢波的標凖綫路，圖中具有再生作用，所以它効力之佳不下於普通的二三級高放式，並且還可改作小電力的發射機，製造亦不十分困難。</p>
<p>綫圈Ｌ是初級，圈數和普通一般，ＬＩ２的每個上下部分約爲普通屏栅圈的二分之一，舉例說：ＬＩ全部如果是七十圈的，那末ＬＩＡ三十五圈，ＬＩＢ也三十五圈，不過其確實圈數須試騐而定，ＧＬ是栅，漏眞空管Ｖ用乾電時可用ｒｏ，交流則－５３及２Ｂ６都可用，有研究興趣者，盍一試之。</p>

<p>（四）卽景</p>
<p>天氣逐日暖和起來，院子里的柳葉也一絲絲掛上了，早晨的太陽照存紙糊窗上，顯得熱烘烘地。</p>
<p>因爲每天要到外面去散步，我於六時左右就起身，這在鄉村並不算得怎樣早，最早的應該是瓦檐縫里的麻雀，天剛破曉就可以聽見牠們的呌聲。禽類對於光明的需求極迫切，又因爲棲止飛行的所在很高，所以對於光明的感覺也最快，此外要算是獸類，而以人類爲最遲。這緣故，是因爲有一種人知道利用這黑暗，另一種人却又屈服於黑暗，黑暗對於人類旣成習慣，光明的感覺也就一天一天遲鈍了。</p>
<p>但在人類里面，其實也並不一樣，窮人對於光明的感覺比富人來得快，鄉村又比都市來得快。這里旣是鄉村，又多窮人，所以等鳥獸一呌，接着就有人在這破曉的光明里活動了。　　我每天　　的地點，是沿着�</p>
<p>村子北面去路。那地方可以看見紅霞着太陽從東方出來，農家的　　繞着村後的榆錢樹。　　　　有的空氣隨處都溢着芬　　里是成畦的草紫，嫩綠的　兒承住露，油菜花也黃了。</p>
<p>在種着　包草花的園地里，三五成羣的年靑村姑，在那兒蹲着採花，她們凖備帶到鎭上去賣，這上面每年也可以出產不少錢。種了穀，種了麥，種了一粒粒農夫的汗血，帶到城市里，價錢是出乎意外的賤，也從來不曾有人稱讚過，如果把花帶往鎭上，太太小姐們就這個說美麗，那個說新鮮，說</p>
<p>不定在興頭上，還會多賞給幾個錢兒。</p>
<p>這種情形鄉下人看得很明白，所以種花的也終於一年年多起來，替鄉村添了不少美麗的景色，這景色，也就顯示了一種悲慘的命運。</p>
<p>村北大路是没有盡頭的，我知道怎樣帶住我的脚步，站着看農人在田里工作。他們忙着把泥士翻鬆，忙着把野草除去，他們的工作是緊張的，我眞不相信自己有可以安閑地站着的理由。</p>
<p>太太，小姐，老爺，少爺們知道怎樣享受那些花，穀，麥，以及一切非鄉下人所能想得出的新花樣和洋傢貨。奢侈，荒淫，閑適，享樂包住了他們整個的生命。</p>

<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>在滇西的旅途上，瘴氣最毒的地方，　�</p>
<p>大槪要算　江壩吧。據一般的傳說，倘若要經過　裏，必須淸晨一早，嘴裏吸着草烟，迅速地走過：其餘的時候，瘴氣便出來了，如果不知道，冒險走去，嗅着糯米飯似的香味時，那就極其危險。明楊升菴謫居永昌時，作「寳井篇」一詩，曾有「潞江八灣瘴氣多」，「啞瘴須臾無救藥」，等等句了，可見潞江地方的令人害怕，也是自古巳然的。不過這只限於夏秋兩季，冬天春天却不甚要緊我走到那裏的時候，幸好是在二月，所以旣不必選定時間，也無須嘴裏啣着烟草，而且還在江邊住了一夜哩。</p>
<p>潞江壩是一個沿着潞江（亦作怒江）的狹長原野，兩面鑲着又高又陡的山峯，外面的天風，極不容易吹入，終年通是很熱的。壩裏生長的茅草，均較他處堅靱，這大約就是氣候有毒的證明吧。江上有鐵索橋一條，聯繋着永昌騰越間的商旅，白天人馬經過時，也許是熱鬧的，但在夜裏却是寂寞地横臥着，江流在下面奔騰怒吼，向南面的山峽，急急衝去。橋頭的扁額上，藉着月光的照耀，顯出了「瀘水」兩個大字，及一行李根源書的小楷。</p>
<p>「難道「五月渡瀘，深人不毛　的瀘水，便是這條江麽？」</p>
<p>懐着陰鬱的疑慮，拖着倦疲的腿子，便趕快踏入橋下的燈火人家了。但帶着驚詫的眼光，迎接我的屋裏男女，却並非如我們的漢人。女的短衣齊腹，長裙及踝，通作黑色。說話時，露出漆黑的牙齒，但面容却是美好的。頭部用黑綢纏着，堆高至尺許，彷彿頂了一隻小桶似的。我一看見，便禁不住聯想起故鄉城隍廟裏的地方鬼來了。而且，從竹壁縫中溜進的風，時時把燈光吹得閃閃不定的，夾着她們在屋裏赤促走來走去的影子，總使人不不免有些胆怯。同她們一桌晚餐，飯是全冷的，蕨葉和野菌煮成的湯，以及炒的乾筍，又都只是　温而巳。（原因是她們不喜歡熱的食物，這由於天氣炎熱使然）。如果把這一夜的經歷，作爲到了幽冥世界一樣，也許更要恰當些吧。這便是我在雲南西部第一次遇見的擺夷。</p>
<p>西洋人帶給中國的東西，最普遍最深入於内地的，大槪要算鴉片首屈一指吧，在這裏的擺夷人也早巳接受着這種禮物了。當女主人把我領進另一間屋子去安息時，一個躺在竹床上吸烟的擺夷少年，就略略抬起頭來，舉槍歡迎着我，�</p>
<p>看他淸秀的面孔，只不過十五六歲吧了，令人微微感到黯然。</p>
<p>「今晚有個老漢人到我們老擺夷家來了！」</p>
<p>聽見女的在隔屋笑着，低聲講說生硬的雲南話，而且又特别加了兩個不必要的「老」字，我一面脫衣，一面輕輕笑了起來，心裏覺着：</p>
<p>「這是和平良善的民族呵！」</p>

<p>— 葉蒼岑</p>
<p>在一個雨後的夏日的薄暮，我穿過一條泥濘的小路。路兩旁陰翳着叢密的柳林，從林裏發出來熱烈的歌音。�</p>
<p>我知道這正是黃鶯的歌唱－－</p>
<p>火似的熱情在空中浮漾！</p>
<p>啊，我胸中也鬱積着無邊情熱，我要把它化作纏綿的新歌；在寂靜的深處，把自己躱藏，深深地傾吐出你一樣的歌唱！可是呀，時光却不讓我稍停，我須穿過這面前的泥濘。</p>
<h3 id="c286">山舗票（二） <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>

<p>門裏：靑色的煤氣燈在嗤嗤地笑，這幾百萬道的光就像急雨，落在牆上，桌上地上，人身上。····再進去就是一座高櫃檯，像是當舗，又像是銀行，櫃檯上園了銅欄杆，欄杆上貼了許多條彩色紙的標語，門口左邊壁上掛了兩塊黑板，黑板上用白粉寫着上次中獎的幾個字。許多拖了木屐的，掛武裝帶的，載眼鏡的，梳油　的，便在這家店門口不斷的擠出擠進。�</p>
<p>阿發想跨進去，可是腿祗是往旁邊扭了扭，重又筆直的走到前時來的路上去了。「這樣多的人買，怎麽會買中呢？這比海裏撈針都難！難！難！難不要去上當罷！」是嘴這樣勉强的對脚的不合作分辯着。</p>
<p>阿發眞的不想買！這這樣說，阿發的心會提出抗議的，牠是眞願，可是禁不住有些慌。他自己明白那是第一次搭火車，第一次跑進大茶居，對了每一樣陌生新奇的東西，起初不免的不自然和心慌。</p>
<p>這眞有些奇怪，六七月熱得把螞蝗都泡熱了的稻田裏，自己這雙脚從没有像這兒一半的怕踏進這間店裏去。</p>
<p>「得勇敢些！這又不是偷竊，怕什麽？說不定没有熟識的人在那兒！那麽多的人在湧出湧進的，要認都認不出，就是認出了，怕什麽？又不是犯什麽王法？况且，誰不愛錢？誰又是不貪横財的？········」</p>
<p>他心裏的聲音愈是喊得響，他的脚步出就朝前挪得分外快。</p>
<p>「頂覯的羅岡洞糯米滋茘枝啦！······二毫錢一斤。」他巳經走到快富街的轉角了。他下意識的掏出了幾個銅子買了幾顆，一邊剝着吃，一邊重以轉回頭。</p>
<p>有了茘子在乎裏剝着，别人不會疑心他是專心想去買山舗票了。他的膽大了許多。他在門口逗遛了一會。他得把這家店舗看得仔細些。</p>
<p>當門是一幅文多長的紅布，貼着西瓜般大的金字：「二毫可得四萬餘元！」他的心一縮，血停了。接着便是狂奔狂跳起來。四萬多元？他以前祇是糢糊地曉得中了頭獎，可以有很多的錢，從没有料到會有那麽大的一喜，他的脚重又往前面大步的跨過去。啊，啊，怪不得他們要買，······他們並不傻！化二毛錢來换四萬多塊錢，誰說不値得？啊，啊，一千元都値，一萬元都値！····他走到第五間香粉店舗面便折回了。</p>
<p>再去看看店裏還寫些什麽東西。</p>
<p>銅攔杆上一條紅色的紙給風一掠：</p>
<p>「撞啊手神！」他的心又是一震，脚又想邁開去了。不，慢些，再看幾條是怎麽說的。第二條，黃色的：「就買就中！」第三條，靑色的：「大開横財之路！」第四條，紫色的：「··········」</p>

<h3 id="c311">正義與和平 <a href="#c311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>公說公有理，婆說婆有理，這是就個人方面而言，這個國家說他們主張正義與和平，那個國家說他們主張正義與和平，這是以國家爲立塲而言了。個人的利害不同，所以由鬥嘴而打架者有之，國家的利害衝突，所以由爭辯而開戰者亦不少，然而個人因利害不同各持理由，大多儘人明瞭，而國家因利害衝突各主張正義與和平，却大多將國民蒙在鼓裏驅之以砲灰，所謂正義與和平這口號的魔力也就不可思議了。</p>
<p>報載念二日東京電通社電，日本林陸相對駐日蘇聯大使詳細說明日本國民，無論何時無用武力之意。日本所必要之軍備，在日本帝國之安全，感不受威脅之程度内。日本爲正義之故，無論如何犧牲，有起而抵抗之凖備與决心。並力言世人謂荒木陸相爲好戰將軍，全爲非戰論者，此乃認識不足。蓋荒木將軍其根本亦和平論者。--這一種主張正義與和平論者的言論，如以連年來他們在中國的武力侵略的成績上看來，恰得其反，然而，在他們却以爲是主張正義與和平，這其中就値得討論了。</p>
<p>在國際戰爭的立塲論之，强國爲着凖備與强國爲爭奪市塲而戰爭起見，甲國必然地先制人爲强用武力搶奪比鄰的弱小民族或國家的領土作爲凖備以與乙國丙國等等迎敵，可是這一種行爲無論任你說得怎麽天花亂墜，總是對於被搶奪了領土的弱小氏族與國家是一種非正義與和平的鐵證。日本旣然巳經搶奪了我們中國的東北四省，現在還聲明是主張正義與和平，正義在那裏？和平更是胡說八道。在我們中國當局之人理應加以抗議，可是却企圖着别的强國出伸正義而喊着「九國條約」，這就難怪某報社論說是中國之亡就在日本相的「不准染指中國」的宣言了。這且不在話下，單就日本林陸相的所謂主張「正義」與「和平」來說，他所謂「正義」是站在日本帝國的立塲以維持他們的利益而言，而所謂「和平」也卽是維持他們國家在東亞的利益而說，這裏所說的利益是不就是日本國民全體的利益嗎？答案是并非如此，所謂「國家的利益」在日本這一種國家論之，若是對於爭奪國外市塲有利益的少數人的利益吧了。�</p>
<p>站在國家的立塲上而主張正義與和平的，只有被欺凌壓迫侵略的家才够資格。然而我們中國就運公說公有理婆說婆有理的態度都没有，嗚呼，夫復何言？</p>

<p>楊柳依依，燕子雙棲；這是迷人的春天到了。桃花含笑在枝頭，垂楊婆娑在河畔，大自然裏的一切景物，都顯出了那逢勃的生氣。</p>
<p>「春遊芳草地，夏賞綠荷池；」這的確是人生的樂事！但是吾們，爲了生活，爲了環境，所以始終也没有享受這種淸福的份兒；莫說淸福吧！就是要想有一次遠足去吐一吐胸中的煤氣的機會都辦不到，說出來也覺得慚愧的。　　今年入春以來，竟没有一次美麗的太陽給吾們見過，總是陰沉地，憂鬱地天氣，眞要膩煩花人。今天，總算見到了一個淸朗的日子；這是今春的第一個淸朗日子。那是多末地使人興奮啊！這日子是難得的，吾們怎肯輕輕地放牠過去？�</p>
<p>麗，提議去遊新上海，安說：新上海没有什麽好玩，倒不如上他華去。吾是隨便的，新上海也好，龍華也嘸啥；但，大家商量的結果，還是到龍華去。　　吾們三個人，扡着沉重的步伐，踏上了漫長的龍華道；有說有笑的向前走着，在每一個人的心裏，滿貯着許多輕快的感覺。</p>
<p>田野裏的荳麥，菜花，靑靑的，黃黃的，彷佛似一幅美麗的天然圖畫。一股荳花夾着菜子的淸香，直向鼻竅樸來，襲入了各人的心脾。小鳥吱吱，蛙鳥嘓嘓，都在大自然裏播送着牠們快樂的歌聲，和節奏的音榮。吾們置身其間，好像是入了另一個世界一樣，幾乎把都市裏帶來的許多煩惱和苦悶，一箍腦兒都忘記了。</p>
<p>春光呵！美麗的春光，你把人們陶醉了；陶醉吧，儘量地陶醉在你的懐抱裏！</p>
<p>大自然呵，可愛的大自然啊！你是多末地使人羨慕呀！</p>
<p>在龍華寺前，擠着一大堆男女老少的人羣；似潮一樣的湧着，像蜂一般的擁着，陸陸續續地向廟裏湧也，擁進。那裏有很多的鄉下婦人，如鄉下姑娘，手裏都捧着香燭元寳，向每一個遊客香客們兜售。</p>
<p>一連串，一連串的汽車，都在向廟裏直駛進去：停在殿前的空地上。從每個車廂裏，走出那一對對的摩登人兒來；這些都是布爾喬亞的鼻祖。</p>
<p>大殿裏，紅燭挿滿在架上，香烟騰入了靑雲。那些善男信女都虔誠誠地在向菩薩叩頭膜拜，乞壽，祝福。幾個和尚都在忙碌地招待幾個體面的香客。，太太」，「奶奶」，「老爺」，「先生」，的聲浪，偉在那一張吐得出蓮花的利嘴上播送出來。麗看了不禁這樣地說：「和</p>
<p>尙原來也是勢利的！」</p>
<p>「那當然，和尙的勢利要比在家人高明得多呢！」安接着附和的說。</p>
<p>吾並不作聲，只向她們不經意地點站　。因爲，　這時正在留意另　　　事情　　　　　　　　　　　　　　－－－兩個小夥子，在胡調三個年輕的女學生。－－－</p>
<p>東邊的園裏，在園的一角，有一只亭子，裏面坐着一對情侶在講情話；臉偎臉，肩並肩的談得很有味兒。園的中</p>
<p>央有茶社，掛着一塊，香茗每壺一角」的牌子。還有點心店，一切的雜貨攤也都應有盡有。回到殿前，有幾個鄉下孩子對吾們說：「要看大佛麽？吾可領你們去看。」吾們只置之一笑，没有回答他們。門口站着很多賣花者，辛夷，玉蘭，黃雀，千葉桃，一切都有。麗要買一束玉蘭，安要買一束千葉桃；吾說：「這些花，都將要萎謝了，要它什麽？」後來，她們終於没有買。</p>
<p>步入了報恩塔，「遊客登塔，每位一角，」的一張紅紙條兒出現在吾們眼前。吾們出了三毛錢的代價，得登了七級浮屠，遠目四瞻，湖山如畫，荒郊田舍，風景在抱。這時的吾們，眞不啻升地獄而登了天堂一般，一般的高興。</p>
<p>回來，吾們想乘火車到南站的，却不料因爲貪看了窗外的風景而乘過了站頭；竟演了一回滑稽把戲。等到查票員來軋票，攙明白，當時大家不覺好笑起來，竟有這末一回事的。那查票員倒很和氣的關照吾們到辛莊下了車，再乘六點多鐘的車了回上海。</p>
<p>到了莘莊，吾們都說這眞是意料不到的，今天竟會來遊莘莊。吾們雖在莘莊等了一個多鐘頭，然而，差不多把這兒的鄉鎭都摸到了。</p>
<p>聽說：今天這兒還有提燈會啦！這是「慶祝蔣委員長剿匪勝利的提燈大會。有四條龍，十只獅子，多好看。安想看了提燈會再回上海，但，没有夜車，不成功，於是，終於來不及看了。</p>
<p>六點敲過，吾們大家都還　着肚子，因爲鎭上没有好吃的東西；可是，終於綸那兩像長蛇似的火車，帶着了茫　然的三個區壳，　了莘莊而向着　長的　　上前進</p>

<p>— 文黑</p>
<p>黃浦灘頭的春雨，絲絲地下着，在外灘，望着對河的浦東工廠的偉大建築物隱在霧裏，碼頭上的苦力淋着雨水挑</p>
<p>着貨物上下那從外國載他們剩餘的生產品到中國市塲來傾銷的輪船，杭唷杭唷的喊聲和河裏小汽輪的汽笛恊奏着。一個流浪者身穿破舊的冬外套手提着一枝裂了縫的紙傘兒，站在南京路口的電車站上等車。這人并非負重致遠的英雄豪傑，可也不是以拾蟋蟀爲業的小　三，他和熙來攘往芸芸衆生一樣的一個年幾的人。他這時是從法租界走來，等着搭去北四川路的電車去和朋友借錢。借錢做什麽呢？當然地和上海灘上的平凡而窮困的芸芸衆生一樣地借了錢去還房租與飯賬。</p>
<p>春雨就如多情的女人一樣，她纏綿悱惻似地飄着下着，可是這於心中有事無暇鑑賞黃浦灘頭的雨景的流浪人却是感覺到厭煩苦悶。在平時，他或者對於春雨的纏綿悱惻似地飄着下着的景緻兒，感覺到街道與房屋隱在霧裏有迎乎詩意的畫圖，而或者可以引起他的創動衝動，或者胡縐一兩首詩，或者寫成一兩篇散文，可是，在這時，他的腦膜上還是停留着房東太太那冰冷的臉孔與包飯老板那笑嘻嘻的虚僞的表情，而且心裏在憂慮着去向他借錢的朋友在不在家，就是在家會不會没有錢借給他，他什麽創作衝動一點都没有感應，對於這春雨下的黃浦灘頭的景緻兒更是一點都没有興趣去鑑賞了。</p>
<p>電車老是等不來，我們的流浪者撑着破傘兒站在國泰飯店門口没辦法，時常跑到南京路口向抛球塲那邊伸着　子兒去望，可以越等也不來，再等也不來，今天的一路電車偏在拿他尋開心。看看江海關的鐘樓上的鐘，巳經是四點五十分　，他心裏越着急起來，假如　　朋友的家裏，而他是出去吃夜飯了，那　　　　呢？回來的車錢他没有呵！看看放在破舊大衣的袋裏而其實是好久就揑在手裏玩着的銅板，只够坐一趟的電車，又悔不該剛才以爲一定是可以借到錢而買了一包香烟。一提起香烟，下意識地敎他從袋裏取出一枝香烟燃着來抽。算是銷除了一些苦悶與無聊。一個鄉�</p>
<p>下的老頭兒，也是穿着一件破舊的大衣，在雨下淋着向他走來，「先生，没有路費回家，·····」就向他求施舍了。這對於他是引起了内心的微笑，他想着，我也就怪會自己可憐了，你也來要我可憐你！」</p>
<p>黃浦灘頭的春雨，纏綿悱惻地下着，好像是天也在下涙了。</p>
<h3 id="c314">觀女子靑年會女工演戲（上） <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>上月二十八日下午，圓明園路女子靑年會曾經有一次女工演戲，當時由於友人的介紹，得以前去參觀。</p>
<p>自巳從來没有看過一次工人演戲，因此這一次確給予我不少有益的敎訓。以下，我不妨寫一些自己個人的感想。　　自五四運動以後，中國開始有了新劇的萌芽。當我還在中學的時候，還因着自己的愛好而接近了這一新的傾向了。大槪我們還不會忘記，那時候的話劇，並没有完整的台詞，甚至於根本没有舞台劇本，好像全世界戲劇名著，對於中國都是多餘，而一般觀衆完全不理解，也是事實。這一現象，繼續了很久，所謂：文明戲不過是幾個頗有表演聰明的人到舞台上去信口開河，使人們發生不眞實的哭笑罷了。直到最近爲止，我們看見各個遊戲塲，有好些所謂「話劇」舞台的，仍是「珍珠塔」之類的文明戲在那兒掛羊頭賣狗肉。而同時近數年來，中國戲劇運動，由於不少前進的戲劇家之努力，不管是内容和形式，比較我們小時候，的確是進步了評多。因此，　劇運動在中國巳經有了相當基礎了。卽是說，由於觀衆之速度的進步，戲劇</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>東西，巳經給一部份人相當深切的理解了。�</p>
<p>那末在這裏我們所應當提出的問題是：爲什麽「文明戲」這東西直到現在仍是依然存在？當然，這是有着社會根據　。</p>
<p>記得在五年以前，我個人曾經有一機會在店員之羣的觀衆之中演過一次煤礦工。在嘈雜的人聲中，我們的效果幾乎是等於零，雖然我們的表演，仍是非常誠懇而賣力。而他們自己熱凑起來的「王小二過年」，却是大爲歡迎。又，前不久，在兒童節中我們演了半齣「高貴</p>
<p>的人們」，這因爲事先不知道觀衆全是小學生的原故，他們對於「高貴的人們」並不理解，因此，我們大大的鬧了一次笑話。而他們小孩兒「麻雀與小孩」，却</p>
<p>使他們十分高興。········同樣，遊戲塲中的文明戲台前，始終有着不少感覺興味的觀衆。�</p>
<p>這些都是至可實貴的學識；低級的觀衆，到底不能給他們不能理解的東西，否則我們的演劇將變爲可笑的行動了。關於這一點，在女靑年會的女工演劇�</p>
<p>中我們可得着一個有價値的　　，「　　她們所演的一共是三個劇；「小　　」，「香姐」以及「街頭夜景」。</p>
<p>「小紅襖」是三　劇，寫一個貧苦的家庭，母親给别人家做一件紅棉襖，小女兒以爲母親是給她做的，母親也騙女允說是做給她過新年穿的。及至新年到了，小女兒看見紅棉襖却穿在别人身上</p>
<p>，哭吵起來，這一個劇在選擇題材以至於主題的構成，不消說都是平凡而眞實的。然而却没有固定的台詞，而且所謂三幕也是每一幕所占的時間也不過是兩三分鐘而巳。但是每一個演員都是很隨</p>
<p>便的，没有所謂舞台的嚴肅的空氣。但是自說白至演員的動作都是非常通俗的，每一個觀衆都能理解。特别是所說的是上海方言，動作是文明戲的對於她們非常熟悉。這些都是决定取得效果之主要條件。另一方面，對於戲劇本身，在高度的要求之下却是十分幼稚的，也許紳士淑女們將會忍俊不住哩。（未完）</p>

<p>— 白</p>
<p>自提倡新生活運動之後，學生界要算奉行最力了；貼標語，聞演講競賽會，一切無不有「五分鐘之内全都要轉變成十全十美的新靑年」的氣勢，我校這週又有所謂「各寢室的整潔競賽」；學生自治會並舉派視察委員，到各個寢室實地視察，以表示辦事認眞，說到就要做到；並且還有儆與獎的辦法‘重賞之下，必有勇夫。</p>
<p>但，不幸糾紛的事件隨之發生，凡走過第四寢室的都看見一張宣言很剌目地高高揭示在門上，錄之如下：</p>
<p>第四寢室同人宣言</p>
<p>我們不求　面的　　，我　　保　我們人格淸潔！　　　　　　　　至四號寢室裏，　　到乾　的</p>
<p>陳設，但决没有使人思想　齪的書籍，也没有卑鄙的行爲的表現；我們輕忽了表面；我們重視着内心！</p>
<p>當然，在我們寢室内是找不出你們所需要的淸潔－－－雖然我們有你們所不要的淸潔－－－還是請回罷！</p>
<p>我們的口號是：說得到，做得到。�爲了一些虚僞的榮譽發狂！不做卷起尾巴獻媚的走狗？不盲從。不學流氓。</p>
<p>名士自風流」。</p>
<p>這宣言與口號，顯然的，是在攻撃。或者同學們要以爲這事的發生是不幸，宣揚到外面去是不名譽；但我以爲這正是久巳需要的暴露，學生界暗幕的暴露，不僅是我校，這類似的糾紛在各省各地的學校都常時醒釀，常時暴發。　　不以這糾紛的本身來談，這糾紛的背景却値得一提及。我不用說什麽·「每個學生是自治會的一分子，都應爲自治會盡力，促進自治會的完善」，這些都是誰都知道的；但，或者也是誰都知道的，學生自治會正如社會的一角，有爭奪，有猜忌，有連絡，有破壞，有·····凡社會所有的黑幕莫不是學校中先萌其芽。怎樣爭奪，怎樣連絡，這凡在學校裏經過的誰都明白，不用多費口舌了。便是這般，這次的糾紛經過相當的醖釀而暴發。</p>
<p>我對於第四寢室的同人有一般的憤慨－－－不滿意於自治會的組織，但却不同情他們的舉動，不明眞像的人以爲他們是不良分子，搗亂，有意破壞新生活運動，決不會原諒他們是對於自治會的不完善而生不平，我們的國文敎員早先就說過：「新生活運動難行於三派人，名士其一也」。他們偏要喊上一個「名士自風流」的口號，豈不更加坐實了嗎？但，確實的，學生自治會常會變成一個小小政治舞臺；有爭奪，有猜忌，有破壞與連絡，正如一般自視甚高的退隱山林的賢者要對卑鄙的政客發發牢騒，這糾紛便因是暴發。�</p>

<p>巳經是四年級了，還會取錄了這麽一大夥的新學生，這在我心中巳詰問了良久，得到的答案是：學校專在求學費的收入，而學生祗是在混資格買文憑而巳；</p>
<p>我們班上來了六個新同學，不知怎的一會兒他們都巳成爲知交了。由耳聞知道這幾個人的來歷都不淸楚，而眼見的又足堪證明言非虚傳了。金邊的西裝書是買起來了，可是我没有看見他們翻過一翻，甚至連上課也不來的吧！就是來祗是請一個來包辦代到而巳！是呀，學校是個旅店，學員的目的是在混個資格，將來的中國文得多製造出幾員高等遊民了。�</p>
<p>大槪六個中是有幾個稍有些書本上的特長的。因此在無論考什麽書或做什麽東西前，我總聽見他們中有幾個對這一個說：「Ｘ！你看明天考的書吧！我們忙着玩，况也看不懂，所以完全責任你當負起呢！大槪敎授們都是很媽虎的，一旦嚴勵起來，不准Ｐａｓｓ那請你多寫幾張，替我們都交了好了。」或「明天ＸＸ課卷要了，Ｘ你多做幾頁就行了。其實交給了先生那裏，他會替你眞的去改嗎？讀書眞没有意義，所以我近來連書都不高興買，有錢買書不會吃買東西吃；哈－－－哈－－－眞好笑，除了我們以外，我們班上有很多的人是在作書記，什麽功課都是從别人那裏抄來的·····這樣的三月過去了，月考也算Ｐａｓｓ，哈哈他們得到些什麽呢？月考可以這樣過去，會考呢？看他們怎麽辦呀！</p>
<p>一天的下午，發見這同夥的六個人效頭接耳在校園裏密談，我從他們那兒走過，偶然的聽到；「會考眞不要急，我巳替你們籌劃好了。保你是畢業戴方帽子好了。」啊！他們的神通倒眞廣大，難怪他們可這樣的快樂。可是父兄們的金錢呀祇作了買文憑的工具。然而倒底文憑是怎麽了不得的一回事呀！它一定能解决我們的生活嗎？</p>
<p>大槪他們的經濟巳告了絕量了吧！不然的話爲什麽不像以前那像的大吃而特吃呢？爲什麽要向人借貸了呢？因此我又聽見說他們六個人中的一個正在計設誘惑ＸＸＸ中學裏的一個富商之女兒，據說巳經用了她很多的錢了呢。</p>
<p>自己熱烈地離開家鄉來到這最高學府求學，但是所見所聞的在在令人恢心。呵！大學是祗不過一個這末的「學府」，大學生活又不過是這麽一回事呀！</p>

<p>— 白榕</p>
<p>深秋的薄暮。�</p>
<p>靜的街：空氣中早消失了人的聲，車馬的聲，消不去的是那滯在頭上的絮雲。一堆堆，把天裝飾着，像古錦。夕陽如懶散的游客，蒼茫而又憂鬱地凝睇着自己的前途。從天邊，從樹梢，黃昏便那麽輕易地流瀉進來，牠瀉進這浮着凉意的街，　靑的鋪道，圓圓的滿溢着詩意的窗，裝飾着薛蘿的八月的的園子，然後再從凄迷的燈火中漸次消隱，而黑夜便來覆蓋達這當前的一切。�</p>
<p>是靜，靜中又泛着一點冷，梧葉子像離人心緒那麽到處飄。�</p>
<p>連路燈都是冷的。</p>
<p>和路燈的影子垂直，黑色的，是個少女靑春的肢體，瘦長的個子，偏着鬚，有晚開的花那樣的凄凉味，晚風中，什麽都在飄動：衣裙，頭髮，素色的身·····不動的只有那凝定的含着哀愁的目光。</p>
<p>這目光正凝視着前面。</p>
<p>在前面，有沉沉的燈，沉沉的樹蔭，沉沉的夜，全黑的。可是在她生活前面，同這一樣，也展着那麽一幅黑沉沉的圖畫，而且是凌觀的黑，粗糙，糢糊，黯淡，没有放射着燈光的路燈，没有增人美感的樹蔭和那鋪道，有的只是烏黑的夜景，没有祖國，没有家，没有親人，她孤零地被抛棄在這任人踐踏的大都市裏，每天要裝着笑臉安慰不認識的人，這樣把她靑春消磨過去，可是她不是壞人，她需要愛，會愛，懂得愛，但人們偏不要這些，想到這，她依依地望了望飄在地下的梧桐葉子。</p>
<p>一片，兩片，三片，這麽廻旋着，舞着·····兩片，三片，四片，廻旋着，舞着，這麽趕向前去······趕向那透着琴聲的紗窗　去。－－�</p>
<p>看不淸是橙色的，抑是茜色的，從扁　松的梢頭圓繃看這麽一片紗，像殘夜的娟娟的月，從那裏面流出歌聲，輕忽得如一個被忘却的童年的夢。蕩到街頭，蕩到籬角，然後再從黑暗中消隱，聽到那麽和婉的調子，誰不會想起自巳的家來呢？</p>
<p>不錯，她是在禁不住悄悄地想念自己的家。</p>
<p>可是「家」，這麽親切這麽熟稔的字，在她記憶中是只能引起一些不愉快的印象的。她不是没有家，她的家是在遙遠的，遙遠的海東頭，一個古風的，開滿了璀燦的櫻花的國土裏。她記得在她十歲那年，爲了父母担負不起，便提了那麽一個輕便的小包，含着童稚而可笑的眼涙，被自己叔父帶到這古老的支那來了。剛來的時候，什麽都不習慣，可是現在，她不是可以操着異國的語言而藉這個維持自己的生存了嗎？她不是每天都在大街小巷穿出穿進，像在自己故土裏一樣嗎？想起這，一些夢幻的感覺便來到心頭。八年是過去了，可是這八年可不是悄悄過的啊！八年之前，誰也不會想到自己會淪落到這種樣子，其實，只要叔父健在，自己也不會有這東飄西泊的一天。</p>
<p>從實生活的不滿挑撥着久不重温的記憶，她又想到自巳的叔父－－－－</p>
<p>瘦長子，滿臉總是笑，常把自己穿進一個方格的和服裏，安詳地抽那廉價的紙烟，一面在燈下結算那賬，這麽抽着算着，八年從他手底滑過去了。可是在那一年的春天，不知中了什麽魔，自己却連店裏的財物都不顧，跑到虹口去做什麽便衣隊去。機關槍響了一夜，死的威嚇把她推送到這僻靜的租界來，跟就是砲吧？跟着是血吧？跟着是火光燎天的喊殺吧？無人收檢的屍骨是堆起來了，當然他們是很容易被人忘記的，和她叔父，她朋友一樣，和許多支那的人們一樣。</p>
<p>因此，在另一方面人們欲着香檳酒的時候，她便淪落到這家酒店做侍女來了。</p>
<p>她的名字是勝子，爲了好聽，現在改做美蓮。</p>
<p>她有一張秀冶的臉，一點沉默，和一點純潔的心。</p>
<p>她是會輕倩地笑着的，可是現在，她却笑不出了。</p>
<p>陳在她前面，身後，左右，過去的生活如魔幻的網，這麽糾纏着，廻轉着，那景色眞呌人目迷·······</p>
<p>「帝國的權威啊！没有家的旅人啊！」</p>
<p>一面太息着，便拉拉衣襟，把憂煩鎖在心裏，拖着懶散的脚步向前走去，這樣穿過黑沉沉的一條街。</p>
<p>是靜，靜中又泛着一些冷，梧　子像離人心緒那樣飄。</p>
<p>運路燈都是冷的。</p>

<p>— 小鶯</p>
<p>--是的，這，這，是早在我想像中的收穫呵！明，沉思着，不能制止的激　在他的心版上冲洗着。</p>
<p>時候，是仲春的季節了。哼，「春」，多麽媚人的字意喲！那「春情」漫漾在年靑人的心頭，那「春風」吻在每個人的臉上；輕輕地，軟軟地，甜甜地，吹着，浮着。花瓶裏桃花在迎着牠展開了笑顏，紅暈的少女的臉上，透露着醉人的酒窩，西洋的女人半裸着她們的上衣現出了誘惑性的肉體，那····這些，活躍的，動蕩的，所混合的迷人的藴力，對於明，却完全的失效了。</p>
<p>在75W的奶色燈泡下，吐着皎潔的光，呑食着全房間的各部。就在那臨近的台子上，一張比燈光還要潔白的洋紙，在靜靜地躺着，上面，那Waterman的墨水，那Paker的金筆尖，所造成的挺而有力的筆跡啊，在搖擺着方步，踱進了明的眼中。</p>
<p>不知是感觸呢還是刺激？他只默默地，俯在那台子的邊上。花了，一層輕綃似的東西蒙住了他的眼球，呆呆地，他出着神。</p>
<p>當一陣春天裏的秋風吹送過去的時候，多凉爽喲！隨着，他淸醒了。不自禁的，回想着，思索着！</p>
<p>那是幾個月以前的仲秋時候，不知朋友們是有意的開玩笑呢還是誠摰的申說；</p>
<p>--明，怎不寫一個長篇呢？不，中篇也好，總比小品過癮的，</p>
<p>--哼，寫？過癮？寫什呢？什麽過癮呢？得啦，别妄想吧！妄想的結果，會有着打破你想像的遭遇的。當時，明也曾這樣的私忖過。</p>
<p>卽刻的，他有些覺悟了，因爲他認識自己，以自己這樣的一個低能兒，怎麽也會能蒙友朋的捧塲呢？無疑的，那是在譏諷着自己，也就是對自己的一種侮辱！</p>
<p>人類，究竟是有着「向上」心的，不，與其說向上不如說「氣憤」比較着來得眞實。爲了這，曾使他的心情紛亂了好多天。</p>
<p>---然而，用什麽體裁呢？·····破了</p>
<p>產的農村？對，多時髦喲，取這樣的體裁，就同那「趁火打刦」一樣的新鮮。但是，不成，農村没有蹲過，太陽出來時，不知是紅的或是白的。這，是生平的第一砲，要像開花彈一般的有力，絕不能如此的冐昧。·····那末，逃荒？災年？兵難？不錯，也有着前一般的效果，不過·······</p>
<p>---最後，他發現了這樣的一句：「文學，是社會一切動向的前趨，是生活的反映。」眞的，根據這條原則，我是應該寫出反映在我生活裏的是什麽，那，不但有力，而且，還可以引起同情，說不定·····嘿！</p>
<p>稿子，終於在「天下無難事，只怕厚面皮」的條件下完成了。跟着，使他�</p>
<p>發生因難的是：「往那裏投呢」，在這各有門的現代？於此，苦惱緊纒着他，前時的勇氣减消了。</p>
<p>到底稿子被送了出去，接受的地方，是標榜着「没有門戶之見，歡迎外稿的一個刊物。輕輕地，明吁了三口氣，全部的重量，似乎卸除了。</p>
<p>一週，二週，······出版了，廣告上不看見自己的名字，又出版了，照樣的渺茫；一勺冷水澆滅子他心中的火焰，他想：「不登了吧？不能，不能，那，爲什麽不退回來呢？哼，兒知道！」懐疑，破滅，懊喪，種種的情緖在交戰着　　上了燈的一個傍晚，郵差遞進了一個大的信封，種種地，封皮上的筆跡，在隨同着心而跳躍。撕開了，是不是嗎？原稿，絲毫未動，總算客氣吧？還附上那麽潔白的一張信紙；這，多少是有點損失的。</p>
<p>·····尊稿巳經拜閱，詞藻之美，含意之深，殊爲欽偑，·····惟以·····一時······故····尙祈····是禱·····</p>
<p>有人說，中國文字的奥妙，就在「起承轉合」的應用上。在這裏，明明意是「文字簡陋，不堪應用」，但在「轉合」的情况下，把這痕跡完全的抺殺了。不能制止的激　在明的心版上冲洗着，他沉思着----</p>
<p>----是的，這，早在我的想像中了。哼，没有門戶？外稿？騙鬼，總之，這就是無名文丐的唯一收穫呵！</p>

<p>雖說我希望日子快一點的過去，這最後的一天了，也應該珍惜着我花一般生活的最後的一天。老天爺也在可憐我，牠飄着毛毛的細雨，是憑吊我嗎？老天，抑是想蹂躪這朶含苞未放的蓓蕾？</p>
<p>人潮湧着，平常不想往來的什麽婆什麽叔，都滿漂亮的來喊恭喜。人類眞是奇怪的動物，喊恭喜對於他們有什麽利益呢！</p>
<p>藴姊和許多同學也都來了，但是她們不再俏皮，她們和我談了許多惜别的話，希望還時常和她們通信。我到這時候纔掛了兩滴眼涙，一個從容就義的英雄倒底失了她的毅力。</p>
<p>那可憐的人，他不時從外房走到裏房，裏房走到外房。一個忠實的伙計他眼看着自己没有能力購買的心愛的東西要被人攫去了，他能和店主反抗嗎？還要掛着笑臉來歡迎那主顧呢！</p>
<p>到晚上媽忽然慌起明天穿的結婚禮服店裏没有送來，我就要求他陪我一同去。兩個人走出門來，誰都不徵求誰的同意，自顧默默的向露飛路走去。</p>
<p>馬路上巳亮了街燈，我踏着忽然拉長忽然縮短的自己的影子，和着他的步伐，一隊出發的軍隊，向敵人砲火射來的方向衝去似的，那般嚴肅，那般沉着。這樣向前去罷，這是一條没有盡頭的路。</p>
<p>街燈在頭頂上亮着，路旁的小樹巳開始飄落牠的黃葉，巳轉入了秋的季候了，這正象徵着人生，一會時我們就要老去，對於靑春何必這樣的戀戀呢，這軀壳終有老死的一天！</p>
<p>心裏想着時，脚步自然的放慢了。他以爲我是不能長路陡步的，撫了我的手，問我；「乏力嗎？」我搖頭，重放快了脚步向前走。</p>
<p>「鶯妹，慢一點走罷，我們應該珍貴這最後的一天！」</p>

<p>( ) On the morning of the 4th, after the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan, a secret meeting was held to discuss the draft diplomatic recommendations. First, Fu Chengchang reported on the results of the review, stating that the four points proposed by Legislator Xiao Shuyu had been reviewed and reorganized from the proposals made by Legislator Liu Xun, resulting in four points. After Fu's report, more than twenty members, including Gu Zhenggang, Wang Yusheng, Tian Xin, Huang Youchang, and Luo Ding, expressed their opinions. Luo also advocated that Xiao's proposal be put forward for discussion again. Xiao spoke, saying that the entire case was related and that since the first two points were difficult, he would have to withdraw it and not submit it for further discussion. Other members spoke, some believing that the proposal was too empty after being revised and advocated for its complete dismissal. Finally, Chairman Sun Ke spoke, saying that some of the administrative authorities were already working on Liu's proposal and that the Legislative Yuan might as well have a recommendation. After about two hours of discussion, the result was that the review report was passed, the text was arranged by the Secretariat, and it was immediately submitted to the Central Political Council for reference by the diplomatic authorities. It is expected to be sent out next week. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the disposal of the Yutian Local Militia, after discussions between Yutian County Magistrate Chen Sheng, Chief of the Second Security Corps Wei Yonghe, and Yin Rugeng, it was decided to first disarm and dismiss them, then select the best to form Defense Corps, designate locations, and provide practical training. Chen and Wei went to Ji County this morning to meet with County Magistrate Wu Minghao and others to go to Yan Gezhuang to handle the matter, which can be completed within a few days. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong spoke, saying that the rebellious Yutian Local Militia under Wang Bingxiao will not be tolerated, and he has telegraphed Security Corps Chief Wei Yonghe to resolve the issue. This matter is attributed to the officials in charge not implementing the regulations effectively and being overly apprehensive, resulting in a failure to resolve it quickly. In fact, the local militia only numbers in the hundreds, possesses dozens of weapons, and is instigated by Japanese ronin. The local authorities immediately claimed that there was a significant background and dared not disarm them, which is quite useless. He has now strictly ordered them to follow the provincial regulations. If the force wants to surrender to the puppet regime, they will be allowed to escape, but they will not be allowed to disturb the war zone. Yu also said that recently, rumors about Hebei have been rampant in various places. In fact, someone is trying to encroach on us gradually, not rapidly. As they encroach, we should have a way to deal with it and not panic and frighten each other. It is essential to remain calm and work hard. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Guangdong and Guangxi Authorities Advocate Strengthening the Central Government, Chen Jitang and Li Zongren Prepare to Issue a Circular Expressing Their Attitude, Requesting the Establishment of a Southwest National Defense Committee, and Then Abolishing the Executive Department and Political Council <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After receiving the telegram from the Southwest a few days ago, the central government immediately telegraphed to Chen Jitang and Li Zongren in Guangdong and Guangxi, providing some explanations and detailing the increasingly serious national crisis, ordering them not to harm the public for private gain and support the enemy with supplies. After Chen and Li secretly discussed the matter, they decided to take the following steps:</p>
<p>First, Chen Jitang of Guangdong and Li Zongren of Guangxi will issue a joint circular to the country in the name of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, expressing the extreme indignation of Guangdong and Guangxi regarding the acts of aggression and vowing to fulfill their duties to protect the country and its people as the vanguard of national salvation. They will also declare that the Guangdong and Guangxi troops are the national armed forces and that soldiers should obey orders and never engage in internecine warfare. In addition, to express their determination, they will also declare in the telegram to the authorities of various provinces that at this time, they should thoroughly understand the current situation of the central government, and persuade them to eliminate prejudices and jointly seek to strengthen the power of the central government. The telegram is currently being drafted, and it will be sent after Bai Chongxi, Xia Wei, Yu Hanmou, Li Yangjing, Miao Peinan, and others fully agree. The second step, after the circular is issued and receives the response of the southwestern provinces, is to contact the military authorities of Fujian, Guizhou, and Yunnan, and jointly send a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting approval for the establishment of a Southwest National Defense Committee in the five southwestern provinces, and asking Chiang to send senior officials to Guangdong to assist in presiding over it. It is said that most people advocate that the location of the committee should be in Guangzhou, and each of the five southwestern provinces will send one representative, and the Military Affairs Commission will send two representatives, totaling seven members of the committee. All organizational methods will be roughly the same as those of the Beiping Military Branch. The third step, after the National Defense Committee is established, is to implement the abolition of the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Council, and then convene a Southwest National Defense Conference on a regular basis to carry out large-scale national defense and military deployments. Chen Jitang and Li Zongren have already telegraphed Jiang Dingwen and Wang Jialie to conduct initial consultations after deciding on the various legislations, and Chen has telegraphed Yang Dezhao, his representative in Nanjing, to pay respects to Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek, report and request instructions, hoping that it will become a reality as soon as possible. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to a lack of understanding of the central government's internal and external policies, there was a misunderstanding on the part of the Southwest. Chen Jitang immediately telegraphed Yang Dezhao, his representative in Nanjing, to return to Guangdong to inquire about everything. Yang left Nanjing for Shanghai the day before yesterday and took a boat to Guangdong from Shanghai on the morning of the 4th. Yang's trip is solely to report the latest political and diplomatic situation of the central government to Chen, and there are no other tasks. He will return north soon.

<h3 id="e9">Sato Explains Japan's China Policy to the French Foreign Minister, Vigorously Argues That Japan's Declaration Does Not Violate the Nine-Power Treaty, France's Position Is Roughly the Same as That of Britain and the United States <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Japanese Ambassador to France Sato met with French Foreign Minister Barthou today to explain Japan's policy towards China. His words were the same as those made by Foreign Minister Hirota to British Ambassador Lindley last Sunday. Sato clarified, and Barthou replied that the French government was satisfied with the record of Japan's respect for China's independence and the treaty rights of the powers, and learned that Japan could not ignore interference that could endanger order and justice under certain circumstances. Barthou also said that in the event of such interference, France firmly believed that Japan would, together with other countries, seek a legal solution to such disputes in accordance with the principles of the Washington treaties, because the procedure for peaceful resolution is firmly enshrined in Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty of February 6, 1922. The French government believes that only within this scope can an appropriate and satisfactory solution to the China incident be obtained. The exchange of letters between the Japanese Ambassador and the French government was of an oral nature and not a formal diplomatic document. (Reuters Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Content of the Exchange of Letters between Japan and France <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Japanese Ambassador to France Sato visited Foreign Minister Barthou this morning and voluntarily stated that the declaration issued by the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 17 this year did not conflict with the provisions of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922. After the oral statement, Sato also handed over an unsigned document to the Foreign Minister, which stated that Japan had never harmed China's independence and interests, and had no intention of harming them. On the contrary, Japan sincerely hopes to maintain the integrity of China's territory and hopes that China will achieve peace and prosperity. However, this purpose should, in principle, be realized by China itself and achieved through its own efforts. Japan has no intention of violating the rights of other countries in China, and Japan is satisfied that financial and commercial activities carried out in good faith can only have a good impact on China. Japan naturally supports the principle of equal opportunity for the open door in China and strictly abides by existing treaties and agreements. However, Japan only considers its own survival interests in certain areas due to its geographical location. If any interference by a third country is sufficient to harm the order and justice of the Far East in such areas, Japan cannot ignore it, regardless of the pretext. Therefore, if a third country disregards the aforementioned situation and attempts to implement policies that are beneficial to that country by using the China issue, Japan cannot recognize it. (Havas Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, Japanese Ambassador to France Sato declared Japan's China policy to Foreign Minister Barthou and submitted a document. The Foreign Ministry also sent an unsigned document to the Japanese Ambassador, explaining France's views. Its content first stated, "The French government is pleased to note that the Japanese government has stated that it will not only faithfully adhere to the general principles of international law, but also to the various treaties that currently regulate the relations between the powers and China." The conclusion of the reply refers to Japan's claim of interference harmful to the order and justice of the Far East, stating that "the French government believes that if such a situation occurs in China, the Japanese government can consult with other countries to jointly discuss legal solutions based on the principles contained in the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and that the procedure stipulated in Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty should be used as a basis. In the French government's view, only within this scope and in this form can a fair and satisfactory solution to the China incident be obtained." (Havas Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>According to Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty, the contracting powers agree that in the event of any situation arising where any one of the contracting powers considers that the application of the provisions of this treaty is in question and that it is appropriate to put the question of this application up for discussion, the contracting powers concerned should immediately exchange views fully and without reservation.

The post-war plan, in addition to improving local products, also includes convening a provincial production and construction conference in Chengdu. The planning is thorough, and I deeply admire it. Today's grand plan for national salvation was previously submitted to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and I in a joint telegram, stating that the elimination of the Communist bandits and the strengthening of production and construction should be carried out simultaneously, which is extremely urgent. It is hoped that all provinces will rise up and take action. As your brother, you are in overall command of the military and control all of Sichuan. Knowing that the bandit problem has not been resolved and military affairs are still pressing, you are already paying attention to this and are taking the lead in planning production, coordinating, and organizing it. Your courage to persuade and guide is especially commendable. Sichuan is a land of abundance, with the richest production and transportation. Compared to the frequent wars, the people are exhausted. It is hoped that you will firmly preside over it, be pragmatic and realistic, order the council to have concrete plans, and report them to the cabinet and ministry so that they can be implemented simultaneously with the cabinet's previous telegram to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes. Then the people's difficulties will be revived, and the resources will gradually increase. The reputation established will depend on this for the opportunity to revive, which will not only be a comfort to Sichuan. I respectfully express my heartfelt thoughts and await your instructions.

<h3 id="e65">Japan's Plot in South China <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The Japanese Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi, returned to his country to report on his duties. He has been discussing the new policy towards China with Hirota and Senjuro Hayashi for several days. He plans to change the policy of "quiet observation" and start taking active actions. As soon as this proposal was made, the situation in South China suddenly became tense, following in the footsteps of North China. Recent intelligence about South China is shocking and should not be ignored. What is particularly important is (1) the Taiwan Governor-General's Office is about to hold a consular conference on the other side of the strait. (2) Japanese military attachés and personnel from the Taiwan Governor-General's Office are inspecting the interior of Fujian. Moreover, a large number of Japanese are secretly surveying coastal maps, defense works, and maps of important strategic passes, and are secretly colluding with Taiwanese ruffians and bandits in various places. (3) Japanese people are secretly sending Taiwanese people deep into the interior of Chaozhou and Shantou to collude with local gangsters and scoundrels. (4) The Japanese Army, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, in view of the importance of trade and military affairs in the South Seas, have requested our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to allow them to establish an air route from Fuzhou, passing through Shanghai, Fuzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore. (5) Li Shijia, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government and commander of the Majiang naval port, revealed the Japanese conspiracy to invade South China. (6) According to a message from Shameen, the Japanese have decided to take action in South China in January or February. First, they plan to seize Mawei and Xiamen as naval bases and plan to set up a committee to liquidate our debts, citing excessive indebtedness. At the same time, the president of the Tokyo Industrial Company, Uchida, met with Wang Jingwei, who is also the foreign minister, hoping to reorganize the old debts. This shows the precariousness of the situation in South China, especially in Fujian Province. It is still remembered that during the Fujian Incident, Ariyoshi's official letter to our side stated that "the imperial government has not only important treaty rights in Fujian, but also a large number of its residents live there." It is expected that the reason for their future aggression will also be based on the provision of Article 21 that Fujian should not be ceded. The tens of thousands of Japanese and Taiwanese residents in the province are also a hidden danger to our side.</p>
<p>The biggest reasons for Japan's plot in South China are probably no more than three: first, to increase commercial interests; second, to prepare for war against Britain; and third, to divide China internally.</p>
<p>(A) Since 1930, Japan's exports to China have been declining day by day. Last year, it was surpassed by Britain, the United States, and Australia, falling from first place to fourth place. Although the reasons for this are not all the same, our boycott of Japanese goods is indeed a major reason. In the midst of the nationwide call for economic severance with Japan, the atmosphere in South China is the most激昻. According to research by experts, the South China market, which directly imports major Japanese goods, has been lost almost entirely since the September 18th Incident. In addition, after our country increased import tariffs last summer, the export trade of cotton textiles, which is linked to the lifeline of Japanese industry, also felt serious pressure. It has no choice but to urgently seek a way out. It is said that after the tax increase last year, the total value of major Japanese imports from June to September was far less than in the same period of the previous year. The decrease in South China was even greater than in North China and Central China, not less than 85.3%. Now that Tokyo's new policy towards China takes the adjustment of economic relations as a prerequisite, how can it remain silent? Earlier, the Commerce Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued an order to merchants at home and abroad to join the "Japan-China Joint Stock Company" as soon as possible and planned to set up branches in Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hankou, Fuzhou, and Hong Kong to develop trade in various places. From then on, it will actively promote its ultimate goal, which is to realize the "Japan-China-Manchukuo economic control plan." Planning South China is only a part of the entire plan.</p>
<p>(B) After the Washington Conference abolished the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Anglo-Japanese relations have always been outwardly friendly but inwardly estranged. After the British government notified the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty in April last year, the anti-British rhetoric of the Japanese was at its peak, and voices saying "Britain and Japan will definitely fight" could be heard everywhere. In addition, Japan's southward advance policy fundamentally conflicts with British colonial interests. Therefore, an Anglo-Japanese war is indeed possible. The British preparations for war against Japan include (1) consolidating and strictly guarding important military ports and bases in the Pacific and Indian Oceans; (2) strictly guarding the Suez Canal so that its warships can pass directly without hindrance; and (3) establishing air and submarine bases on the Chinese coast. Conversely, if Japan wants to resist British attacks, it must first seize Chinese merchants as bases. The average distance between Fujian and Taiwan is only 250 kilometers. Once it is occupied by the British Air Force, Taiwan will inevitably be exposed to the threat of group air strikes. If it is linked with the air force in Manila in the south and attacked Taiwan, it will put the Japanese in a very embarrassing situation. Japan has always wanted to dominate the Western Pacific. It has secretly negotiated with Siam to dig a canal in the Kra Isthmus to isolate its power against the British operation of Singapore Port. How could it not be vigilant about the competition for this South China coastline? But I don't know if our authorities have also paid attention to it.</p>
<p>(C) From now on, Japan's policy towards China will focus on dividing the objects of negotiation. Planning South China is to destroy our unity. The Japanese, although claiming to hope for China's unification, actually fear China's unification the most. Considering the Japanese past tricks, which have been endless, it is not known what other conspiracies and ambitions it will have in the future. It is hoped that the South China authorities will not be coerced or tempted, recognize the face of the public enemy, and take strict precautions against it.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Army is working hard to improve the organization and equipment of its forces and to prepare emergency supplies to refresh its military appearance. It is expected to be completed by February next year. Regarding the permanentization of this, Minister of the Army Hayashi has ordered the relevant authorities to investigate, and the investigation will be conducted by the standing committee without setting up a separate investigation committee. The permanent military system is expected to be established in 1936. The disposition of the Kwantung Army is based on the opinion of Commander Hishikari, but it generally remains the same as it is now. Furthermore, the strengthening of the national air force is highly valued. A considerable amount of funds will be included in the army budget for both 1936 and 1937. Furthermore, the enrichment of air force strength and the maintenance of armaments are necessary, but the training of air force personnel and the expansion of the operating efficiency of aircraft factories are also urgent tasks and are all being addressed.

<p>(Tokyo) The third conference of local governors organized after the Saitō Cabinet's formation commenced its first day of meetings today at 10:30 AM at the Prime Minister's official residence. All ministers, including Prime Minister Saitō, were in attendance. After the Prime Minister delivered a few words, Finance Minister Takahashi and Home Minister Yamamoto delivered speeches on financial administration and local issues. The meeting adjourned at noon, and the Prime Minister hosted a banquet for the governors at his residence. The meeting resumed in the afternoon. (Chinese United Press dispatch of the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota delivered a speech at today's conference of local governors, stating in brief that modern diplomacy should not be limited to negotiations by diplomatic organs; interactions among the people are also of great importance, and he earnestly hoped that attention would be paid to this point. Secondly, Japan's assertions must strive to enhance friendship and amity with all countries. At the same time, Japan's mission in East Asia must not be forgotten even for a moment. Japan's mission is to be a force for stability in East Asia's peace. Maintaining peace and order means that East Asia should jointly shoulder this responsibility with other countries. The realization of this weighty mission is the fundamental reason for Japan's maintenance of its status as a great power. Japan sincerely hopes that China can preserve its integrity and achieve unity and prosperity, but reliance solely on external, self-centered assistance will not achieve this goal. Moreover, if a third party causes disputes in Sino-Japanese relations or takes reactionary actions to maintain peace in East Asia, Japan will by no means remain silent. Regarding recent relations between China and Japan, fortunately, China has gradually tended to understand Japan's true intentions, and it seems that relations between the two countries have now progressed to a good foundational understanding, which can be considered a satisfactory phenomenon.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister then discussed trade issues before concluding as follows: In short, we will face many difficulties from now on, as it is natural for a nation and its people to encounter various difficulties when they are developing and progressing. We should be aware of this. However, the people should always act with extreme humility in all matters. In essence, diplomacy is a reflection of national strength. It is essential to expect a vigorous national spirit, unity from top to bottom, and diligent efforts to enhance national strength, as this is a fundamental condition.

<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi spoke at the conference of local governors. The following is a transcript of his instructions on foreign trade issues: Foreign trade has been quite active since the year before last. In recent years, the trade situation in various countries around the world has been extremely sluggish, but Japan's exports have made relatively active progress. This is due to rationalizing production internally and continuously exploring new sales channels externally. However, recently, various countries have adopted measures to prevent and suppress Japanese goods. If this trend continues, Japan's exports will suffer a tremendous blow. The reasoning is very clear. The laws approved and promulgated with the support of the Diet are intended to prevent the above-mentioned resistance. Regarding the formulation of the Trade Adjustment and Protection of Commerce Act, it will be used to deal with foreign countries, and the government will be granted the authority to implement appropriate measures. How to use this law will depend on various internal and external situations and must be carefully considered. (Japan United Press dispatch of the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Ariyoshi Advises Hirota to Advocate "Waterfowl Diplomacy" Towards China: Overtly Displaying Calm While Diligently Engaging in Covert Diplomacy; Simultaneously Advancing Conciliation and a Steel Blade <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo dispatch: Ambassador to China Ariyoshi, who returned to Tokyo on the 28th of last month, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Foreign Ministry at 1:30 PM on the same day, engaging in talks that lasted for two hours. Ambassador Ariyoshi provided a detailed report on the progress of negotiations on pending Sino-Japanese issues and recent developments in China following the conclusion of the North China armistice agreement. In conclusion, he stated:</p>
<h3 id="e73">Outwardly Serene <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>"For diplomacy towards China, continuing to pursue 'waterfowl diplomacy' is still the wisest course, rather than moving one's feet in a flurry of activity. (Note: A waterfowl floating on the surface of the water appears calm, but in reality, its feet are extremely busy underwater. This means maintaining a detached attitude outwardly while engaging in frequent covert negotiations.) Some people advocate initiating overt and direct negotiations to resolve pending issues in one fell swoop, but this may be counterproductive." Foreign Minister Hirota listened to Ariyoshi's important advice but did not express any views.</p>
<p>Ariyoshi's report on the anti-Japanese movement began with the issue of boycotting goods, stating that since the North China</p>
<p>Incessant murmur armistice agreement, anti-Japanese sentiment and boycotts of Japanese goods in China have gradually eased. During the implementation of the "Manchukuo" imperial system, there was some resurgence. As a result of this recent informal statement to China, this movement is now likely to raise its head again. Regarding this issue, he has repeatedly requested the Nanchang government to take serious measures to suppress it whenever the opportunity for its resurgence arises. In particular, during his recent meeting with Wang Jingwei, he drew attention to the anti-Japanese speech in Beiping, the resolution of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to boycott Japanese goods, and the seizure of the Shanghai Manchukuo Yearbook, through official documents and letters.</p>
<p>Completing the Imperial Dream Ariyoshi further stated that during his meetings with key figures in the Nanjing government, he had repeatedly emphasized the reality of the existence of the "Manchukuo Empire." Japan's government and people have a firm belief in its cultivation and development and are providing dedicated assistance. Therefore, if China still wants to pursue the dream of the Lytton Report and change the organization of "Manchukuo," the result will only be to further complicate the situation in the Far East. Therefore, this issue should be allowed to develop naturally, separate from Sino-Japanese issues. However, the Chinese side has not yet accepted this hope, and this issue has become an obstacle to resolving pending Sino-Japanese issues.</p>
<p>Statement Dispute Regarding the impact of the informal statement to China on the 17th, this occurred after the meetings with Wang</p>
<p>Momentarily Subsided Huang and others. Before departing Shanghai, Wang sent a representative to express regret over the statement. He explained that the statement was the true intention of the Japanese Empire. Regarding this issue, it has aroused disputes in European and American public opinion, and China is probably still discussing it, but in a month or two, it will inevitably return to calm.</p>
<p>Nanchang Conference Regarding the content of the Nanchang Conference, there are various rumors. The Nanjing government</p>
<p>Various Rumors is deeply concerned that the establishment of customs offices will become a de facto recognition of "Manchukuo." The General Assembly of the League of Nations will meet on March 14, and the relationship between the Universal Postal Convention and Manchukuo will be discussed. The Nanjing government intends to use this opportunity. It seems that the Nanchang Conference did not make any specific decisions on the postal issue. (Above, by Gaironsha)</p>

<p>"Origin Marking Act" Since this act was</p>
<p>Report on Progress promulgated last summer, the Japanese side has</p>
<p>Continued to protest the "Tariff Issue." The amended tariff rate has a trial period of one year and will inevitably be amended again when it expires. "Sino-Japanese Liaison Issue" The Sino-Japanese liaison issue has been pending since 1929. China has firmly opposed this proposal, citing that "it has not concluded such treaties with other countries," and it is currently difficult to realize. "Trade Issue" After the Manchurian Incident, the import of Japanese goods into Guangdong Province was absolutely prohibited. Recently, it has been possible to import them openly, but due to the bankruptcy of rural villages, it is difficult to expect an increase in trade with China. "Organization of Old Loans" According to recent investigations, due to the financial difficulties of the Nanjing government and the exhaustion of the financial world, it is impossible to quickly organize the claims of the Empire and its subjects against China. Therefore, there is currently no good method other than to take a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>The above report is the content transmitted by this newspaper. It remains to be seen whether Foreign Minister Hirota's active policy and Ambassador Ariyoshi's waterfowl diplomacy can be properly coordinated.</p>

<p>(London) Secret intelligence from Paris states that France will propose the dissolution of the Disarmament Conference when the General Disarmament Commission reopens in Geneva on May 29. It has been learned today that the British government has received this news. In the past week, the British Cabinet's Special Disarmament Committee held three secret meetings, and its intentions are now revealed. Those close to government circles declare that if the Disarmament Conference fails, the British Cabinet will definitely consider a plan to strengthen British military power, especially the Air Force. Responsible parties declare that the government has now decided to adopt a guarantee of implementation of the disarmament convention, but this is conditional on France and other related countries taking concrete steps towards disarmament. Observers say that the British government's efforts to mediate the Franco-German deadlock are now exhausted, so if France indeed puts the Disarmament Conference to death, the British government has no choice but to increase its national defense capabilities. International diplomatic circles are very worried about this news, believing that the day the Disarmament Conference fails will be the day the League of Nations collapses.

<p>(London) The Cabinet's Subcommittee on Disarmament Issues met this morning. In light of Germany's rearmament, which has become a reality, British public opinion hopes that a disarmament convention can be signed, even if the scope of the convention is limited to Western Europe. However, public opinion is aware that France cannot be satisfied with empty promises, so it also supports the determination of methods to guarantee the implementation of the convention in Geneva. Conservative newspapers recently stated that Britain only has two paths to follow in the disarmament issue: (1) Sign a disarmament convention; (3) Form a defensive alliance with France. In general, people originally did not particularly support the second option, but today, views have changed, and they all believe that if a disarmament convention cannot be established, the only solution lies in forming an alliance with France.

<p>(London) The House of Commons met this afternoon. Conservative Party member Marsden raised the question of whether the British government would "declare the Washington Naval Treaty void before December 31 of this year in accordance with Article 23 of the treaty." Keeper of the Privy Seal Eden replied, "The government currently has no intention of declaring the Washington Naval Treaty void." Recently, British conservatives have been vigorously advocating that Britain should break free from the constraints of various treaties so that its naval development is not restricted. Yesterday, Lord Lloyd, the former High Commissioner to Egypt, said so at a meeting of the British Navy League. (Havas dispatch of the 2nd)</p>

Furthermore, the Hitler government has ordered necessary parts from British and American companies to manufacture 2,500 new-style bombers and fighter planes, some of which have already been delivered. This fact is known to diplomatic circles stationed in Berlin, and it is also heard that Germany is currently working overtime to build airplanes. Several American factories often receive urgent telegrams from Germany requesting prompt delivery. The newspaper also stated that at the aviation exhibition currently being held on Unter den Linden in Berlin, banners are posted that read "Germany's future lies in the air," and express Germany's hope to quickly achieve this goal.

<p>(London) British businessman Sir Simon and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira met today to discuss the competition between Japanese goods and British goods in British colonies. Thus, efforts to seek Anglo-Japanese understanding have taken another step forward. Although official circles are keeping silent about this meeting, Reuters has learned that Sir Simon told the Japanese ambassador that Japanese goods are sold at extraordinarily low prices, so the British government will find ways to protect the British textile industry and other industries from further invasion by Japanese goods. This plan will inevitably proceed unless Japan immediately changes its attitude. The protective actions deemed necessary by the British government are unavoidable and are hoped to provide a path to resolving the Anglo-Japanese cotton industry deadlock soon. The British government has been slow to adopt protective actions in its own country and colonies for more than a year, solely to create the best possible atmosphere for Anglo-Japanese commercial talks. Now, if Britain actually takes protective actions, it is only because commercial agreements seem to have no hope of being established, or because textile talks show no signs of revival. Londoners believe that Japanese exporters enjoy a temporal advantage, so the British government's protective measures must not be indefinitely delayed, but must be limited to a period of time to prevent British commerce from suffering severe damage when talks resume in the future. It is heard that the British businessman informed the Japanese ambassador of several proposals that require a response from the Japanese government. Some say that the meeting between the British businessman and the Japanese ambassador has revealed the breakdown of Anglo-Japanese commercial discussions, but official circles today do not take this view. It is also heard that the British government will notify the Japanese government on May 16 that the trade treaty between Japan and the British colonies in West Africa will be terminated one year from now. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the memorandum of British businessman Sir Simon of England regarding Anglo-Japanese commercial consultations, it was telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Ambassador Matsudaira in England this afternoon. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately held a leadership meeting to discuss what opinions should be expressed. The content of the memorandum has not been made public, and it seems to be quite unfriendly. The Japanese government believes that if the export distribution of British cotton cloth is not done automatically, the British government will cooperate with its colonies to implement orders restricting the import of Japanese cotton cloth. Therefore, the Japanese foreign affairs authorities are quite dissatisfied. As for when Japan's response will be issued, it has not yet been determined. It will probably criticize the unfriendly attitude of the British government and urge the British government to promptly propose concrete proposals for a friendly solution.

<p>(Washington) Japanese goods are flooding the South American market, and American exporters are therefore very concerned. They now hope that President Roosevelt will use the pending tariff bill to conduct reciprocal trade negotiations to assist American exporters in competing with Japanese goods. On the one hand, the United States wants to maintain most-favored-nation treatment, and on the other hand, it wants to negotiate reciprocal tariffs with foreign countries, which has aroused a strange feeling among diplomats from various South American countries here, because they do not know how this contradictory thing can be accomplished. After studying the United States' foreign commercial policy, the Pan American Union believes that tariff negotiations to increase special commercial relations between the two countries seem to be inconsistent with the most-favored-nation principle at first glance. The Roosevelt government now believes that conducting tariff negotiations with foreign countries under the most-favored-nation clause has the possibility of restoring international commerce, and at the same time can maintain the United States' policy of treating all foreign countries equally in commerce for the past eleven years. The committee appointed by President Roosevelt to draft the United States' permanent commercial policy recently reported, acknowledging the need to adjust the national economy to suit world trends. The report also classifies American industries based on the effectiveness of the entire country and the relationship of foreign trade. This change in American commercial policy has made South American diplomats express optimism, believing that there is a possibility of reciprocal trade between the United States and South America. (National Telegram of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials from the State Department and the Department of Commerce heard the news of Britain's opinions on Japanese competition and did not find it strange, but they believed that unless the competition became more intense, the general economic situation in the world, the anti-dumping laws, and the gentlemen's agreement prohibiting unfair competition between the United States and Japan would not make it necessary for the United States to take any severe commercial war actions against Japan. The agreement reached a few days ago to reduce the import of Japanese pencils is one example of the methods used by the United States to avoid commercial wars. According to this agreement, Japan restricts its exports of pencils to the United States to 125,000 gross (144 pieces per gross) per year, a decrease of 35,000 gross compared to last year. Similar agreements on other Japanese goods are currently under negotiation. (Reuters dispatch of the 4th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The tax bill, which has been debated for more than two months, was completed today and sent to President Roosevelt for signature. The Senate today also rejected the Quinn amendment to increase income tax by 10 percent. The tax bill passed today increases taxes on the rich, and there are no changes for ordinary people, or even reductions. The bill will have an impact on the import of coconut oil from the Fiji Islands. Congress expressed satisfaction with reducing taxes for ordinary people and increasing taxes for those who live on securities dividends. Senator La Follette's amendment proposed increasing inheritance tax on the rich, but estates under US$40,000 are tax-free, and estates over US$40,000 are taxed on a progressive basis from 1 percent, up to 60 percent for estates over US$10 million. This item alone can increase government revenue by $85 million. The bill also stipulates that income tax is 4 percent. The bill also imposes heavy taxes on the gains of private companies and large sums. Another amendment to the bill authorizes the President to increase the tax on the branches of foreign companies in the United States by 50 percent for foreign countries that discriminate against American people and American commercial firms. According to the proposer, this is aimed at France. The current capital gains and losses law also stipulates that all assets that have not changed for more than one year must be taxed, and when these assets are sold, regardless of profit or loss, 80 percent must be taxed.

<p>(Tokyo) As a result of discussions between Prime Minister Saitō, Elder Saionji, Grand Chamberlain Yuasa, and Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, Baron Ichiki Kitokurō was recommended as President of the Privy Council yesterday. The important intention is to restrain the power of Vice President Hiranuma's faction, and at the same time to expect to sweep away the forces of the anti-constitutional and pro-military faction. However, Vice President Hiranuma had already been secretly plotting to overthrow former President Kuratomi and expected to be promoted to President in accordance with the tradition by the Vice President (i.e., Hiranuma himself), but Elder Saionji broke the precedent and recommended Ichiki, arguing that the new President Ichiki had once served as Vice President. Therefore, in order to organize the ranks of the constitutional faction, Hiranuma Vice President and his faction will be removed. However, Hiranuma has expressed extreme dissatisfaction and may resign automatically. The military and Hiranuma's faction have close relations. How the conflict between the constitutional faction and the military faction, centered on the Privy Council, will end is worthy of attention both at home and abroad. (Chinese United Press dispatch of the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ichiki Kitokurō's appointment as President of the Privy Council is a break from tradition, as the President of the Privy Council has always been promoted by the Vice President. However, Ichiki served as Vice President during the era of President Hamao, so it can be said to be a natural order. After President Kuratomi's resignation this time, the Hiranuma Vice President faction, which had been expanding its power within the Privy Council, will inevitably decline. In the future, the atmosphere within the Privy Council will attract attention from all sides. According to some observations, Vice President Hiranuma is extremely dissatisfied with Ichiki's appointment as President, so it is possible that he will resign at an appropriate time in the future.

<p>(London) The Kingdom of Hejaz in Arabia is at war with Yemen. Yemen has suffered a defeat and abandoned the town of Hodeidah. There are 300 British nationals in that location, mostly Indians. There is a risk that their lives may be harmed by the Arabs. The British government is paying close attention. It is reported that the British warship 'Bonsons' has arrived there to provide protection. Also, the British cruiser 'Indus Enterprise' set sail for Aden this morning, presumably in connection with the war between Hejaz and Yemen. After the Yemeni troops were defeated by the Hejaz troops, the tribal people of the Arabian desert gathered in the mountains around Hodeidah, fearing that the town would be ravaged by these people after the Yemeni troops withdrew and before the Hejaz troops arrived. As a warning, British military aircraft circled the town in the sky several times today. London officials claim that who wins or loses is irrelevant to Britain. What is feared is that the war may endanger the lives and property of British nationals. Although Kamaran Island near Hodeidah is not a British territory, the quarantine station there is related to Britain, as this station is jointly operated by the British and Dutch governments to check for epidemics among those coming from the Dutch East Indies to Mecca. At the same time, according to news from Cairo, the Imam of Yemen, in order to avoid Muslims killing each other, has withdrawn his troops stationed in the disputed area and has requested the King of Egypt to step in as a fellow believer to mediate and restore peace. (Reuters telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Aden - The troops of King Ibn Saud of Hejaz are advancing victoriously along the Red Sea coast. Now, apart from a few small principalities, almost all of Arabia is under his control. Ibn Saud has long cherished the dream of unifying Arabia, and the time for realizing it seems not far off. The troops of the Imam of Yemen, known for their elite status, have been unable to recover after being defeated by the Hejaz army. It seems that their territory will soon be incorporated into the territory of the Hejaz. Three British warships are currently docked in the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, and all foreign nationals there have been moved to Kamaran Island. The rumor that the Imam of Yemen was assassinated by rebellious subordinates has not yet been officially confirmed. However, it is reported that the Imam fainted due to depression while convening a meeting. When the troops under his command heard the news, they lost their will to fight, and suffered a disastrous defeat. (Reuter's telegram from this agency, 4th)</p>

<p>Under Japanese Puppet Oppression</p>
<h3 id="e100">Farmers' Economy Bankrupt, Exorbitant Taxes Emerge Endlessly, Income Cannot Cover Expenses <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Northeast agricultural soybean production originally ranked first in the world. The prosperity of the Northeast also came from soybeans. However, since Japan created puppet organizations, righteous armies have arisen, and there have been endless military disturbances. Exorbitant taxes have emerged endlessly. In addition, agricultural freight rates are extremely high, and farmers are really overwhelmed. Now, due to the overproduction of soybeans, soybean prices have fallen miserably. Each "fudu" (equivalent to 30 kg) is only worth about two or three jiao. After deducting shipping and transportation costs, farmers receive almost nothing. As a result, the countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy. Here are the facts obtained from the investigation:</p>
<h3 id="e101">Water Transportation Costs <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The transportation costs from the center of Harbin, per</p>
<p>fudu, are all calculated in current silver dollars.</p>
<p>The value and transportation costs of soybeans are listed below:</p>
<p>Location Soybean Price Shipping Cost</p>
<p>Fujin 3 jiao 1 fen 2 jiao 4 fen</p>
<p>Jiamusi 3 jiao 5 fen 2 jiao</p>
<p>Yilan 3 jiao 9 fen 1 jiao 8 fen</p>
<h3 id="e102">Railway Transportation Costs <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the facts of railway transportation costs:</p>
<p>There are 750 cars of soybeans held up in Suihua. The market price per fudu is 4 jiao, and the transportation cost to Harbin is 1 jiao 2 fen. There are 100 cars in Hailun. The market price is 3 jiao, and the transportation cost is 2 jiao. There are 1,200 cars in Taian Town. The market price is 3 jiao 1 fen 5 li, and the railway transportation cost to Dalian is 6 jiao 1 fen. There are 400 cars in Keshan. The market price is 2 jiao 2 fen, and the transportation cost to Lianbu is 6 jiao 4 fen. Since the transportation cost is already like this, the soybean price is eroded by the transportation cost, and almost nothing is left. One can glimpse the plight of the farmers.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Exorbitant Taxes <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The various taxes paid by farmers include:</p>
<p>National tax 5 jiao, security maintenance fee</p>
<p>3 fen 7 li, mountain forest guerrilla fee 1 jiao 3 fen, Heilongjiang province tax 1 fen 2 li, totaling 6 jiao 7 fen 9 li. In addition, Baojia fee 6 jiao, police fee 2 jiao 6 fen 7 li, education fee 3 jiao 7 fen 1 li, totaling 1 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen 6 li. The above totals 1 yuan 9 jiao 1 fen 5 li. This is the situation in Heilongjiang. The other provinces are similar.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Farmers' Income and Expenses <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Farmers' income and expenses per "xiang" (equivalent to 10 mu):</p>
<p>Labor wages 12 yuan, cattle and horse farming fees 10 yuan, miscellaneous expenses 2 yuan, totaling 24 yuan. On the income side, assuming that each xiang can harvest four shi, and each shi is 3 yuan, then the income per xiang is only 12 yuan. In addition, if you deduct the horse-drawn cart transportation cost to the station, then each horse-drawn cart, assuming it carries a large shi, and calculate the incidental miscellaneous expenses, each cart can reach 3 yuan, then what is left? It is no less than farming and losing money. If it is for sale, there are many expenses. Also, every 100 yuan of sales proceeds must pay a police fee of 2% and an education fee of 1%, totaling 3%. In addition, it is necessary to deduct farmers' living expenses, entertainment expenses, and self-defense expenses, etc. The degree of loss is self-evident. The plight of farmers in the Northeast can be imagined.</p>
<p>Southern Route Army Eliminates</p>
<h3 id="e105">Remnant Bandits South of Junmen. Frontline Troops Deploy Defense Works, All Agencies Donate Funds for Local Relief. <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent: I have just received a telegram from the front: On the 24th, Huang Shitu's regiment recaptured the bandit strongholds of Wushi and Xiashizai, capturing more than ten bandit officers and soldiers and more than seventy guns. There were more than a hundred scattered bandits on the mountain of Dihui Rock. After being surrounded and suppressed by Ye Gang's regiment, they retreated to Huichang on the night of the 21st. Dozens of bandits were left to guard the mountains. On the morning of the 24th, it has already been completely resolved. On the 21st, Xie Zheng's regiment's first and second battalions were sent to occupy the bandit strongholds of Dasanggang and Lazhudi one after another, killing more than two hundred bandits. Lian Dangsheng's regiment captured the bandit stronghold of Huangshadong River on the 21st. Now, the bandits in the area south of Junmen Ridge have been completely eliminated. It is said that the Communist bandits have gathered their remnants since being severely damaged in Junmen, and have requisitioned small groups from various places, totaling more than 30,000 people, led by the bandit leader Zhu De. They are concentrated in Ruijin, Yudu, and Huichang, and plan to counterattack in three routes. In addition to ordering the frontline troops to deploy defenses, the Second Column is stepping up the construction of fortifications to contain the westward invasion of the Yudu Communist bandits. Miao Peinan, Chief of Staff of the Southern Route Army Headquarters, went to Meixian the other day to meet with Li Yangjing, Commander of the Second Column, to discuss the overall plan for suppressing the bandits. The entire plan has been agreed upon and reported to Chen Jitang. Li Yangjing then set off from Meixian at 10:00 am on the 25th to inspect defenses around Junmen. After Li Yangjing arrived at the front line, he reported yesterday that the main force of the Red bandits guarding Junmen had been defeated and fled, and is now gathered in Huangkengdong in Ruijin, where they have established a fake headquarters. The Communist bandits suffered heavy casualties in Junmen this time, with only more than 2,000 people left. The baggage and equipment have been almost completely lost.</p>
<p>Both ammunition and food are scarce. The miscellaneous grains in the former bandit area have been looted. It is reported here that the front line has been ordered to step up the deployment of defenses and handle the aftermath. The Seventh and Eighth Divisions have made great contributions to the recapture of Junmen and have been given a reward of 10,000 yuan from the Headquarters to reward the officers and soldiers who contributed to the two divisions. Also, because the Junmen area has suffered from the Communist bandits, the people are suffering. The political training offices of the Seventh and Eighth Divisions are ordered to rush to handle the aftermath and organize the Baojia system. The Provincial Government also resolved on the 27th to donate some money from the savings of various agencies to relieve the displaced people in the bandit area near Junmen Ridge. It was immediately decided that the Guangdong Provincial Government would donate 1,000 yuan, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau 1,000 yuan, the Provincial Bank 1,000 yuan, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau 1,000 yuan, the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau 500 yuan, the Tumin Earth Factory 1,000 yuan, the High Court 300 yuan, and the Anti-Smuggling Headquarters 500 yuan. The money will be remitted to the Commander-in-Chief's Office and handed over to the front for handling. (April 28)</p>

<h3 id="e107">He Chengjun Goes to Northern Hubei Again to Inspect, Convenes a Meeting of Generals to Deploy Military Affairs Against Bandits, The Border Blockade Measures Have Been Approved and Implemented by Chiang <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Telegraph: He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, previously received a telegram order from Chairman Chiang to go to Xiangfan to deploy defenses against Sichuan bandits and to supervise the suppression of the remnant bandits led by Ma Xiyou, Wang You, and Liu Guitang. He also convened Xu Yuanquan, Zhang Ming, Zhang Zhenhan, Fan Shixing, and others, giving them instructions and assigning them to suppress the bandits separately. Before long, Bandit Liu fled to Henan, and Wang and Ma also suffered heavy losses. The construction of the blockhouse highway project to defend against Sichuan bandits has also been accelerated. He then received a summons from Chiang to go to Jiangxi to report on the inspection and deployment situation. Chiang said that northern Hubei borders several provinces and has a strategic location, so he instructed He to go there to oversee and control all parties. Recently, Wang and Ma's remnant bandits have returned to northern Hubei and have shown signs of resurgence. Therefore, He went north again at 10:00 am on the 2nd. He arrived in Yuan'an in the afternoon of the same day, inspected Xiao Zhichu's troops, and decided to go to Pinglin Temple, on the border between Anlu and Yingcheng, on the 3rd to inspect Rong Jinfang's troops. Then he will follow the Hua Road to Fancheng. In addition to continuing to inspect the blockhouse highway and set a deadline for completion, he will also convene a military conference in Fancheng with generals such as Xu Yuanquan, Fan Shisheng, Zhang Zhenhan, Rong Jingfang, and Luo Qijiang to discuss ways to thoroughly eliminate bandits.</p>
<p>He Chengjun had previously submitted five proposed implementation measures for the border blockade in Hubei Province to Chiang: (1) According to Article 1 of the Proclamation, the designated blockade areas in the Hubei border area, belonging to Zhuxi, Zhushan, Fangxian, and Badong counties, are all adjacent to bandit areas. (2) In accordance with the blockade measures for neighboring bandit areas, blockade management offices should first be established in the county towns of Zhuxi, Zhushan, Fangxian, and Badong counties, and management branch offices should be established in Quanxi in Zhuxi, Baihe Lu and Liushudian in Zhushan, Jiudaoliang in Fangxian, and Dafengyi in Badong. The county governments should investigate the situation and set up inspection cards and build blockhouses at other important passes to Sichuan. Each inspection line should be divided into various routes connecting bandit areas. (3) In addition to setting up blockade management agencies, each county should set up a food, salt, and kerosene public sales committee in its respective areas. The county governments should determine the number of sub-committees based on local conditions and submit them for approval. Regarding salt, Zhuxi, Zhushan, Fangxian, and Badong have always been supplied by imports from Sichuan. The county governments should pay special attention to this and prevent it from being transferred to bandit areas. (4) The establishment of blockade agencies should be organized jointly by local military and political leaders and local gentry, and should be handled in accordance with the blockade regulations issued by the Nanchang Camp. (5) The head of each county should supervise the handling of the blockade situation each month and report it to this office on schedule so that it can be reported to the Headquarters of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui for reference. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang gave the following comments: "The proposed implementation method for the Hubei border area blockade is generally feasible. However, Item 3 mentions the establishment of food public sales committees in each county town. The public sale of grain should be postponed unless absolutely necessary. You should comply with this." Now, the Pacification Headquarters has ordered all localities to begin implementation. (May 2)</p>

<p>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Force Daughter-in-Law to Hang Herself</p>
<p>Xu Fugeng, a resident of Xiang 30, Chenjiahang Township, only had one daughter, named Suying. Last year, she married A-Cai, the eldest son of Zhang Zhong, a resident of the same township. At the beginning of the marriage, their relationship was harmonious, but the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had eccentric personalities and often abused Suying. When she returned home to complain to her father, he always advised her to go back and live with him. On the 15th of the lunar month, Suying died suddenly. It was reported to Xu Fugeng, who went to see the body and saw rope marks on the neck, which seemed like murder. So yesterday he came to Songjiang to request the prosecutor's office to investigate. Prosecutor Meng accepted the complaint and led officials to the countryside for inspection, and summoned relevant witnesses. According to the report, she was forced to hang herself to death. It was ordered that the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law be released on bail pending investigation.</p>

<p>The County Police Force was previously reorganized by the provincial order into a squadron, with the original water patrol team incorporated into an independent water patrol detachment. Shen Bangda was still the captain. The reorganization was completed and reported to the province. In order to strengthen the police force in various counties, the Provincial Security Department specially appointed Lieutenant Colonel Inspector Ma Hanzhang, along with Hong Pinlan, an instructor from the Military and Police Cadre Training Center, to come to Songjiang on the 3rd. They visited County Chief Jin and stated their mission to Songjiang. The inspection started on the 4th, paying particular attention to drills and firearms.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Rice Industry to Replace with New Measures on Time <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The county is implementing a new system of weights and measures, and all industries are gradually promoting it without any effort. It is also planned to replace the scales of the vegetable vendors in the small vegetable market on a regular basis. For the sake of convenience and consideration for small merchants, it was decided that the county government and the chamber of commerce would borrow 200 yuan to purchase new scales and notify the vendors to buy them at a low price by the end of this month. If there is any disobedience, punishment will be imposed once discovered. The rice industry is still using the old measures, and the county government has discussed with Qingpu and other neighboring counties to implement the replacement of new measures on June 1 to uphold the law. A notice has been issued to all to inform all merchants to abide by it, and the Rice Industry Association has also been ordered to notify all merchants to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Grains and Cakes Industry Association Appeals to the Provincial Government <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Fengjing Town Grains and Cakes Industry Association, due to the increase in business tax on wholesale sales, has repeatedly telegraphed the Finance Department to maintain the order. Now, dissatisfied with the Finance Department's approval, it has filed an appeal to the Provincial Government. The facts and reasons for the appeal are excerpted as follows: "(1) Facts: It has been found that members of the association, Zhang Chengtai, Dinghua Company, Peng Hengyi, and other three companies, are operating in Fengjing Town, engaged in the wholesale of bran, not retail sales. The business tax of these three firms has always been paid at half the rate according to regulations, that is, one per thousand. On March 2nd of this year, the Songhu Jin Business Tax Bureau forwarded an order from the Finance Department stating that the bran industry, regardless of retail or wholesale, should uniformly be taxed at two per thousand. After the association listed the reasons, it successively telegraphed the Finance Department on Jiang Hanri's behalf, requesting that the original plan of collecting taxes according to regulations be maintained. The approval received stated that Jiang Hanri's telegrams were fully understood (omitted below), and that the request did not comply with the regulations and was difficult to approve. The above is the situation of this case. (2) Reasons: The change of bran business tax to two per thousand was implemented in the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Before the implementation until December of the 22nd year, the bran wholesale business was still taxed at half the rate, one per thousand, which is in line with the provisions of Article 11 of the newly revised business tax regulations. Now that this article has not been changed, the Finance Department only increased the tax from one per thousand to two per thousand from this spring onward, intending to increase the tax on bran wholesale to two per thousand, which inevitably regards Article 11 of the new regulations as a mere formality. It should be known that the change of the grains and cakes tax to two per thousand was out of the government's consideration for people's livelihood. According to the law, it is a matter of grace. Wholesale and retail are matters of law and order. The relationship between law and order and the government's prestige cannot be affected by the granting of grace. This is very clear. Even as the original approval said, then Article 11 of the new regulations should be deleted or changed, otherwise, what does the original text mean by 'those who have retail business and also wholesale shall not use this as an excuse to pay half tax'? What does 'trickery' refer to? Based on the above reasons, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of the Petition Law, an appeal is filed, and in accordance with Article 11 of the same law, it is requested that the execution of collecting two per thousand be immediately stopped, and that half the tax be collected in accordance with Article 11 of the new business tax regulations, to comply with the law."</p>

<h3 id="e116">Jiading Branch Director Suspected of Releasing Criminals and Arrested <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>After Guan Xiuzhao, the former director of the Nanxiang Public Security First Branch, left office, Li Yiru, the former director of the Department of Civil Affairs, was directly appointed by Gu Renfa to take over. Li appointed Zhao Jinda, the son of Zhao Fujiang, a well-known rogue in the town, as the detective. Most of the detectives were also apprentices of Zhao Fu, and they continued to collude with each other. Zhao had three sons who set up gambling dens in places such as the teahouse in the main hall of the Great Temple and the Pacific Hotel, engaging in various illegal activities. Xue Bingyang, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, learned of this and specially dispatched Inspector Bao Jingyu on the night of the 2nd, leading 18 inspectors, officers, detectives, and police officers to the town at 11:30 PM. More than 20 gamblers, including Zhao Fujiang and Li Yunggu, and three opium smokers were captured in the Pacific Hotel, along with opium and gambling paraphernalia. The next day, more than 10 suspects, including Wang Xiaoliu, a large package of red pill ash, eight large jars of opium ash, a large box of playing cards, three sets of mahjong tiles, a cash box (with separate compartments for different denominations), two sets of pai gow tiles, a list of gambling hosts, and more than 20 pieces of accounts and ledgers for selling opium were seized in Zhao's residence. There was also a book of unauthorized levies collected in the town, named the Huoyin Company, which stated that the monthly income was 200 yuan. The people and the loot were all taken to the town's branch bureau, and it was already dawn. However, Zhao Fujiang, the main suspect who had been detained at the bureau, had escaped again. Director Li of the branch bureau said that he was being watched by Patrolman Ma when he escaped. The bureau director Li Yiru, Patrolman Ma, and Li Yunggu, Wang Xiaoliu, and 13 others, along with the loot, were taken to the bureau to prepare a document and send it to the county. Magistrate Xu believed that Li Yiru had allowed his subordinates to sell opium and gamble, and now he was suspected of harboring the main suspect. He immediately ordered the detention and investigation. Patrolman Ma and Li Yunggu and the other five people were also detained on suspicion of serious crimes. The others were interrogated and released on bail. County Magistrate Xu awarded 5 yuan each to injured police officers Cao Dengming and Wang Yulin for their courageous service.</p>

<p>Due to the impact of the sluggish silk market, the prospects for this year's spring silkworm cocoons are not optimistic. Therefore, fewer farmers are raising them than last year, resulting in a significant decrease in the sales of silkworm eggs. This year, various farms in Jiangsu Province produced a total of over 700,000 sheets of silkworm eggs, with Zhejiang being the strongest in selling them. In this area, about 100,000 sheets have been sold, and there are still over 100,000 sheets in stock, mostly miscellaneous brands. Merchants are extremely anxious about the hatching status and are selling them off cheaply at 1.6 yuan per sheet, which is unprecedented. The old brands, such as Tiger Brand and Longevity Star Brand, are only selling for 7 jiao per sheet. In the past two days, the early helping has collected flowers, and the local varieties in Dongting, Zha Jiaqiao, Qianzhou Bei Qifang, Yuqi Fuzhou Village, and other places have all begun their first sleep. Improved varieties will also be collecting flowers soon. Mulberry leaves in the four townships have no market price yet.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, because Chairman Jiang's Southeast Transportation Tour is approaching, should reorganize the highways that have already been completed in the province. Those that have not been completed should be supervised by the Highway Administration to rush construction. Famous scenic spots, historic sites, and municipal facilities in various counties should also be reorganized. The roadbed and earthwork project of the Xihu Road Xiyu section undertaken by the local Construction Bureau started on the 25th of last month. Since the start of construction, the project has been progressing smoothly, and about 20% has been completed. It is expected that the entire section will be completed by May 15th. The other two roads, Xi-Cheng and Xi-Yi, have already been completed and are open to automobile traffic. However, they also need to be maintained to be perfect. The Wuxi section of the Xi-Yi Road, from the intersection of the Xi-Cheng Road to Huishan, has not yet been paved. It is currently being organized by the Jiangnan Long-Distance Bus Company, which is paving a gravel road surface. About 40% of the materials have been prepared, but there are difficulties in transportation. Once everything is ready, construction will begin immediately. It is planned to use Sanhe soil for grouting and then pave gravel. Recently, the company has purchased 20 diesel oil tarpaulin vehicles from Shanghai to expand its business, which are expected to be transported around the 2nd of this month.</p>

<p>Cai Pei, the former commissioner of the Second District of Jiangsu and concurrently the magistrate of Wujin County, submitted a request to the Provincial Department to resign from all his concurrent positions when he was ordered to abolish the commissioner's office. Subsequently, various local agencies and organizations telegraphed to retain him. Chairman Chen and Gu Renfa, the former director of the Department of Civil Affairs, instructed him to maintain the status quo. County Magistrate Cai continued to handle all county affairs with great effort after receiving the order. However, according to news yesterday (the 3rd), Cai has again requested to resign from the Provincial Department due to his weak health. Upon hearing the news, local agencies, organizations, and gentry have telegraphed to retain him.</p>

<p>Yu Mourong, a butcher from Caijiachang near Fubridge in Wuyi County, was robbed of over a thousand yuan by bandits and shot eight or nine times, resulting in his death. It is learned that after the incident, the local area was greatly shocked. The body has been inspected by the county prosecutor, and relatives of the deceased were interrogated on the 3rd. Public security authorities went to investigate and conduct a detailed study. It is believed that this case is merely a case of robbery by bandits and actually contains elements of revenge killing. Skilled detectives have been dispatched to strictly arrest the murderers for interrogation. Sun Fukang, the director of the responsible Public Security First Branch, requested a severe punishment for his negligence in prevention. The county government has approved the recording of a major demerit and ordered the case to be solved within seven days. At the same time, the county bureau has issued announcements and offered rewards for the arrest of the murderers, offering 300 yuan for each person captured.</p>

<p>The county government previously received an order from the Finance Department to conduct land investigation and reporting. With the active efforts of County Magistrate Bao, the project has actually been completed. However, due to a request for correction submitted by the Yixing Association of Fellow Townsmen in Beijing to the Ministry of Finance, and the telegraphic order from the Cheng County Party Department and various public groups to the county to handle it carefully, the Ministry of Finance instructed the Finance Department to investigate and respond. Now, a response has been submitted, and County Magistrate Bao was telegraphed, stating that someone has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to postpone the land investigation and reporting. The reasons why it is inconvenient to postpone have been reported to the Ministry. You should continue to supervise your subordinates to expedite the work and complete it on schedule, without delay. However, punishment for exceeding the deadline may easily arouse public resentment and should be handled by the county at its discretion. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Bao has forwarded it to the district chiefs for compliance.</p>

<p>Lin Zhongzhe, a 32-year-old from Fujian, once served in the military in Fujian Province. He came to Zhenjiang to visit friends and stayed at the Shunxing Inn near the Danyang Wharf in Ximen. Lin was a devout Buddhist. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, he went to the Wanfu Palace in Changshan, ten miles south of the county, to offer incense and worship Buddha. On his way back to the city after the event, more than a dozen thugs suddenly appeared on the way through Banshan, blocking the road. They robbed Lin of the dozens of yuan he was carrying, as well as a central party card, a pen, a sanitary sweater, a leather suitcase, and a felt hat. The thugs stabbed him with a knife on his leg and forehead, causing him to fall to the ground and unable to walk. Fortunately, pilgrims at the scene saw this and carried him back to the city for treatment. They also reported the incident to the military and police authorities in charge, requesting the arrest of the thugs and bringing them to justice.</p>

It is reported that after several investigations by the local prosecutor's office of the court, an indictment was filed based on Hong's confession. On the 25th of last month, the debate was declared over. Because the evidence of Hong's crime was conclusive, Hong Fuyuan was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e132">On the Issue of Promulgating the Constitution - A Reply to Mr. Wu Jingxiong - Zhang Yuanruo <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>In my previous article, "A Fair Discussion on the Constitution Draft," which appeared in the newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, I received overflowing praise from Mr. Wu Desheng, the Vice Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan, especially regarding the conclusion on the promulgation of the Constitution, which greatly humbled me. Due to pressing matters, I have not yet responded. Now, the period for public comment on the Constitution Draft is about to end. Looking at the comments from all parties, most are biased towards criticizing the articles, words, and sentences. Those who can conduct sincere and practical discussions on the promulgation and implementation of the Constitution, which is more important, are very few. I am deeply afraid that this constitutional project will repeat the failures of previous constitutionalism. With concerns in my heart, I cannot help but speak out. Therefore, I have written this article again to offer my humble opinions. For years, my argument has been based on governance (see my book "On Law"), but law is not constitution-making, and even less should it be repeated constitution-making. Chinese constitutionalism has a history of several decades, and repeated constitution-making has occurred more than once. The splendid constitution has almost gathered the best of the world, but its achievements have only seen the destruction of law and order, resistance and destruction. Not only has it failed to achieve the effect of faithful adherence and long-term stability, but it has also left a bad impression of "fickleness" and "changing one's mind" in the public's psychology. Therefore, the previous constitutions were only strategies for the authorities to clean up the situation and decorations to embellish the facade. The people also had no connection between the constitution-making and their own rights and happiness (see the preface to my book "Modern Constitutionalism"). This is the fundamental reason for the failure of constitutionalism in our country over the years, and it is also the historical lesson that today's constitution-making authorities should seriously learn from.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, there is no need to rush into constitution-making at this time. In terms of the "use" of the constitution, the constitution is a historical product and cannot be arbitrarily created and implemented. In terms of the "form" of the constitution, our country already has a constitution, such as the Outline of National Reconstruction, the Organic Law of the National Government, the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China, and the Outline of Political Tutelage. If the whole country has the spirit and determination to abide by and believe in the law, then our country has already reached the realm of constitutionalism. Furthermore, the model countries of modern constitutionalism, such as Britain and France, have fragmentary and sporadic constitutions, published gradually. The British constitution is a collection of the Magna Carta of 1215, the Petition of Right of 1628, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, the Bill of Rights of 1688, the Act of Settlement of 1700, the Parliament Act of 1911, the Representation of the People Act of 1918, and the amendment of 1928. The French constitution is only a collection of the Organic Law of the Senate of February 24, 1875 (Articles 1 to 7 of this law have been repealed by the law of December 9, 1884), the Organic Law of Public Powers of February 25, the Law on the Regulation of Public Powers of July 16, the Law on the Election of Senators of August 2, the Law on the Election of Deputies of November 30, the Law on the Capital of Paris of July 22, 1879, the amendment to the Law on the Election of Senators and Deputies of December 9, 1884, the amendment to the Law on Elections of June 16, 1885, the Law on Incompatibility of Members of Parliament of December 26, 1887, the Law on Candidates of July 17, 1889, the Law on Military Obligations of Members of Parliament of July 2, 1895, the Law on Preventing Electoral Fraud of 1902, and the various articles of April 2, 1903, February 17, 1908, March 23, 1914, March 31, January 5, 1918, October 17, 1919, August 10, 1926, July 10, 1927, July 21, December 30, 1928. Therefore, the constitution does not need form, but only "faith" and "observance." The legalists said that "bad law is better than no law," which is a deep understanding of the essence of the rule of law.</p>
<p>Then, shall we dissolve the Constitution Drafting Committee and destroy today's existing Constitution Draft? This is also not possible, and this kind of unrealistic argument should not be accepted by those who can fairly discuss politics. Speaking of the matter as it stands, now that there is a Constitution Draft, we must only seek to avoid repeating the past mistakes and be able to implement it effectively. Therefore, I believe that the focus of today's constitutional issue is not on how perfect the articles of the constitution should be, but only on how the promulgation and implementation should be regulated so that a win-win situation can be achieved. The provisions of the Founding Father regarding the promulgation of the constitution in the Outline of National Reconstruction are very solemn. One is: "The draft constitution should be based on the Outline of National Reconstruction and the achievements of the two periods of political tutelage and constitutional government. It should be discussed and revised by the Legislative Yuan and publicized to the people at any time for selection and implementation when the time comes" (Article 22 of the Outline). The other is: "When more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the constitutional period, that is, when the local autonomy of the entire province is fully established, a national assembly shall be convened to decide on the constitution and promulgate it" (Article 23 of the Outline). Therefore, the greatest prerequisite for the promulgation of the constitution is the completion of local autonomy. The completion of local autonomy requires: "A clear census of the population of the entire county, a complete survey of the land of the entire county, proper handling of police affairs in the entire county, successful construction of roads across the four borders, and its people have been trained in the use of the four powers and have completed their national obligations, and those who swear to carry out the revolutionary doctrine may elect county officials to carry out the political affairs of the county and elect representatives to discuss and establish the laws of the county, to become a completely autonomous county" (Article 8 of the Outline). Secondly, "the people shall have the right to directly elect officials, the right to directly recall officials, the right to directly initiate laws, and the right to directly reject laws" (Article 9 of the Outline). Furthermore, the organ that decides on the constitution is the National Assembly, and the election of the representatives of the National Assembly must wait until "after the establishment of local autonomous governments in each county" (Article 14 of the Outline). The convocation of the National Assembly must also wait until "more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the constitutional period" (Article 23 of the Outline). Our country has not yet completed the political tutelage and has no achievements in local autonomy. It is naturally dangerous to prematurely promulgate the constitution at this time. It must be known that the Founding Father's division of the national reconstruction program has its own rich experience, far-sighted vision, and profound knowledge. The realization of constitutionalism cannot be achieved merely through empty words, nor can it be expected overnight. It must be ensured that civil rights are fully developed before there can be a solid and unshakeable constitutional foundation for thousands of years (see pages 86-87 of my book "Overview of Modern Politics"). This principle of national construction is not only suitable for our country's national conditions, but also can be used as a reference for constitutional reform in various countries around the world. We must not underestimate ourselves and rush ahead, disrupting the steps of national construction (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e136">Military Alert <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the May Fourth Student Movement. Military and police agencies throughout the city were on full alert all day, and everything remained peaceful. Today is also a revolutionary anniversary. The commanders of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Security Office, in order to maintain public order, yesterday ordered their subordinates to continue the alert for another day.

<p>Vice President of the Judicial Yuan</p>
<h3 id="e137">Tan Zhen to Sail Abroad Today <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Focusing on the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction, He Will Go to Turkey for Investigation. Judicial Yuan President Tan Zhen has been ordered to go to Europe and the United States to investigate judicial matters. He first went to his ancestral home in Taoyuan, Hunan Province, and then came to Shanghai with his wife and daughter. He has now purchased tickets for the French postal ship D'Artagnan, and together with his entourage of eight people, including his secretary, will board the ship in Shanghai at 2 p.m. today to sail abroad. Our reporter visited President Tan last night to inquire about his views on the overseas investigation. President Tan was then engaged in calligraphy, and Secretary-General Yang Boshen was entrusted to relay everything. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Departing Today <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yang said that when Vice President Tan served under President Sun Yat-sen as the Provisional President during the early years of the Republic, he was ordered to go to Europe to investigate judicial matters, but it did not materialize. Therefore, this subsequent order to go abroad can be said to be fulfilling his long-held aspiration. All overseas passports, etc., were handled directly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was relatively convenient. All ship tickets, etc., have also been fully prepared. It is scheduled to embark at the French Company Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession at 2 p.m. today, take a small steamboat to board the D'Artagnan and sail abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Accompanying Personnel <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Accompanying Vice President Tan to Europe and the United States are English Secretary Yang Boshen, French Secretary Li Jing'an, German Secretary Jian Zan, and Secretary Song Zhenlü, a total of four people. Song Zhenlü is the eldest son of Mr. Song Yufu. He was originally employed at the Audit Yuan and was transferred by Tan to serve as an attendant this time. In addition, Tan's wife and daughter, and his son-in-law Wu Xianshu, also travel on the same ship, but only as far as Hong Kong, and will then take the land route.</p>

<h3 id="e140">One-Year Term <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Vice President Tan's investigation in Europe and the United States this time is scheduled for one year. The established investigation itinerary is to take the D'Artagnan to Marseille, then remain in France for inspection, then to Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, then to Turkey, then from Turkey to Soviet Russia, then to the Netherlands, Belgium, then to Northern Europe and the United Kingdom, across the Atlantic to the United States, then through South America: Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and then return home.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Scope of Investigation <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Yang, representing Vice President Tan's views, the focus of this investigation is on the judicial administration, court organization, and prison conditions of various countries, for reference in our country. Special attention will be paid to the current civil and criminal laws of various countries and their characteristics. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and special importance will also be attached to the constitutions of various countries. During the investigation, he also wishes to exchange opinions with jurists from various countries to assist in the improvement of the judiciary.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Longer Stay in Turkey <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Next, he said that our country is constrained by unequal treaties, mostly due to the inability to abolish consular jurisdiction. The impact of this extends to the inability to recover inland navigation rights, the inability to fully control tariffs, etc., leading to the country's weakness. Therefore, this investigation places greater emphasis on abolishing consular jurisdiction. In the future, after arriving in Turkey, the period of investigation will be longer than in other countries. Because Turkey is a newly emerging country that also suffered from the pain of consular jurisdiction in the past, the experience of its years of struggle, and the current judicial improvements, are greatly instructive for our country. Therefore, a longer stay in Turkey is planned.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Calligraphy on a Screen <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>According to Secretary Yang, our visit to various countries will involve a longer stay in Europe than in the Americas, because world jurisprudence, such as Roman law and Continental law, is concentrated in the European continent. The reporter also inquired whether he would go to Japan for investigation upon returning home. Mr. Yang said that he might not go at that time. Yesterday, Vice President Tan wrote a congratulatory screen at his residence for his niece's wedding. The words were "The peach tree is young and tender, its blossoms radiant. This maiden marries, may she bring harmony to her home." Sixteen characters, followed by "I am ordered to go to Europe this time, and will send my friend's niece, Youlian, to Guangdong on the way, to marry Junfu. Written to celebrate," the strokes are very majestic.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Vice Minister of Industry Guo Chuntao to Sail Abroad Today to Investigate Industries in Various Countries, Expected to Return by the End of the Year <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Guo Chuntao, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, has been ordered to go to Europe and the United States to investigate industries. All preparations have been completed. Mr. Guo took the overnight express train from Beijing to Shanghai the day before yesterday, arriving at 7:30 a.m. yesterday morning. He went to his hotel to rest and decided to take the French postal ship D'Artagnan this afternoon to sail abroad, first to Marseille, then to various countries to conduct investigations. The ship is berthed at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu and will depart at 3:00 p.m. Mr. Guo's relatives and friends gave him a farewell banquet at Xinghualou last night. The Daily News reporter specially visited Mr. Guo at his hotel yesterday to inquire about the purpose of his overseas investigation and the progress of the various factories planned by the Ministry of Industry. He was told in great detail, and it is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Departing Today to Investigate Industry and Commerce <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Guo first said that the Ministry of Industry, in view of the current decline of industry and commerce in our country, urgently needs to find ways to remedy the situation. Therefore, I am specially dispatched to various countries to investigate the state of industry and commerce, to serve as a reference for future remedies. It has now been decided to depart on the French postal ship D'Artagnan tomorrow (the 5th) for an investigation period of more than half a year. It is expected to return to China by the end of this year. The countries currently scheduled for investigation are the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, etc., and more time is planned to be spent in the United States because American industry and commerce are more developed. As for how to remedy our country's industry and commerce after the investigation, I will prepare a detailed report after returning home for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Steel Factory to Begin Construction Within the Year <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the planned state-owned steel factory, it has been decided to locate it in Ma'anshan, Anhui. Preparations are largely complete. However, the value of the 60 million worth of machinery borrowed from the German Xiwang Company still needs careful research. Therefore, Mining Director Huang Jintao has been specially dispatched to the United States to conduct detailed research with American experts, and then to other countries to explore its value. Mr. Huang has now decided to leave the country by ship on the 6th. Once Mr. Huang returns home, everything can be decided, and construction can begin within this year.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Central Machine Factory Decided to Be Located in Pudong <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>As for the Central Machinery Factory planned by the Ministry of Industry, it was originally planned to be located in Caoxie Gorge, Nanjing. However, because the land there is low and transportation is very inconvenient, personnel were sent to Shanghai to find another site. Now a site has been found in Pudong, and negotiations are underway with the Junpu Bureau to purchase dozens of acres of land. The funds for the factory are 6,000 pounds sterling, which has been allocated by the Central Gengkuan [Boxer Indemnity] Committee. Machinery is currently being ordered, and it is expected to be realized in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Paper Factory Solely Run by the Government. The Newsprint Factory planned in Wenzhou is also actively underway. A survey team was dispatched by the Zhejiang Construction Department to Wenxi to conduct surveying, which is largely complete. Construction is expected to begin in August or September of this year. The factory funds were originally planned to be jointly run by the government and merchants, but regrettably the merchants are mostly hesitant. Now, the Ministry of Industry believes that the domestic demand for newsprint is urgent and cannot be delayed. Therefore, it has decided to change the plan and use the 255,000 pounds sterling originally intended for the sulfuric acid factory (because the sulfuric acid factory has been contracted by merchants), together with the 88,000 pounds sterling that the Ministry should receive from the British Boxer Indemnity, for a total of more than 3 million national currency, as a fund to be independently operated by the government. The issuance of 4 million yuan in public bonds will also be used to fund this. The funds for this item are no longer a problem, only the time for the issuance of 4 million yuan in public bonds has not yet been decided.

<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's southbound plane on the Shanghai-Beiping route flew north to Shanghai yesterday morning.

<h3 id="e150">Three Major Steps to Invade China <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Daily News reports that Japan's ambition to invade South China is clearly revealed by its actions in government and society. However, its current hesitant attitude is due to the fact that its strategy has not yet been properly planned, and it has no choice but to resort to cunning explanations to deceive international eyes. We must not ignore this. According to news from foreign sources in this port, Japan's policy of feinting east and attacking west towards China has been fully planned by Hirota in three major steps: namely, enticing entry, bribing traitors, and preparing for military force. However, the progress of the first two is slow, while the preparation for military force is quite active. The strengthening of troops and the expansion of the air force in Taiwan have already been realized. The mobilization of the army is based on the record of the division commander's meeting held in Tokyo on March 28. This is the first important decision after Army Minister Araki stepped down.</p>

<p>The position of Chargé d'Affaires of the British Embassy in China has been announced by the British government to be succeeded by Count Ouboh. The original Chargé d'Affaires, Ingram, has been transferred back to the British Foreign Office to assume another important position. Mr. Ingram has now transferred all embassy affairs to the former British Company in China, Lambson, as Minister Judd has arrived in Peiping. He took the Pingpu train south at 6:50 p.m. on the 1st and arrived in Beijing at 8:00 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 3rd), stopping briefly. He arrived in port yesterday afternoon. It is understood that Mr. Ingram is scheduled to take a British ship on the 6th, via Japan and Canada, to return to his country. As for the new Chargé d'Affaires, Count Ouboh, he will only set off to China to take office after Mr. Ingram returns to his country.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Refutation of the Breach of the Fenglou Dike <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Office of the Engineering and Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee of the National Government sent a telegram to the New Voice Society from Kaifeng yesterday morning, stating that they had read a report in the Kaifeng Henan Republic Daily and the Northern Daily, citing a dispatch from Tianjin on the 2nd, stating that Fenglou had breached again. After investigation, the Fenglou stone dam was closed and connected, and the Stone Village main dike was also blocked and connected. A water-blocking and air-tightening dam was also built at the Yaotou location behind the stone dam, which was also completed last month. All are now stable and there has been no breach. Please quickly disclose this so that those who care about river affairs may understand the truth. The east and west dams have been connected into one, and the flow outside the dike has been cut off for many days. In addition to restoring the original height of the dike, more than 20 li of the dike bank from Shitou Village to Dacheji has been approved by the group to be raised and thickened. Construction is currently underway to raise it more than two meters above the flood level of 1933.</p>

<p>The International Trade Bureau Announces Last Year's</p>
<h3 id="e157">International Trade and Domestic Economy <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<h3 id="e158">International Economy: Chaotic in the First Half, Hopeful for Recovery in the Second Half <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<h3 id="e159">Domestic Economy: Extremely Weak, Rural Areas Increasingly Bankrupt <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Shenshi News Agency reports that the International Trade Bureau has compiled and statistically analyzed the status of China's international trade for the entire year of 1933 and has prepared a detailed report for submission to the Ministry of Industry. The report is excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e160">Submission to the Ministry of Industry: The International Trade Bureau's Report on the Actual Conditions of International Trade in 1933 states: <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>"Respectfully submitted, the total import value for the whole year of 1933 was 134.5 million yuan, a decrease of 16% compared to the previous year. The total export value was 61.1 million yuan, a decrease of 20% compared to the previous year. The import surplus was 73.3 million yuan, a decrease of 18% compared to the previous year. However, this year, there were no statistical reports for the entire year from the Northeast customs. In 1932, the first half of the year still included figures from the Northeast customs. As the scopes are different, it is difficult to compare. If the Northeast figures for the first half of 1932 are removed and compared with this year, imports decreased by about 11% compared to the previous year, while exports increased by 6%. The reason for the decrease in imports is not due to the increase in domestic consumption of Chinese goods, which replaced foreign goods, but rather due to the bankruptcy of the domestic economy and the weak purchasing power of the people in recent years. In addition, the implementation of the new Japanese tariff on May 22 of this year also had a considerable impact. In terms of exports, excluding the Northeast, although exports slightly increased, the amount was small and there was no stable trend. It is difficult to predict whether it can continue to be maintained in the future. As for the nature of commodities, imports this year were still mostly manufactured goods. Due to the lack of figures from the Northeast customs, the disastrous drop in soybean exports caused significant changes in exports. Currently, manufactured goods account for 44.9% of exports, ranking first. However, this phenomenon is merely a change in the composition of the numbers and is not sufficient to indicate the trend of China's export trade. The situation of industrial products is no different from that of previous years. The nature of China's foreign trade still maintains the trade pattern of an industrially backward country that has existed for decades. Its backwardness deserves attention. We hereby compile a report on the trade conditions for the third and fourth quarters and the entire year of 1933 for your review. Respectfully submitted, Chen, Minister of Industry, He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, May 1934."</p>
<h3 id="e161">International Economic Report <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<h3 id="e162">Regarding the International Economic Overview of 1933, 1933 was the Fifth Year of the World Economic Panic. <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>In this year, due to the efforts of various countries to seek relief, the economic situation, although still chaotic in the first half of the year, showed signs of recovery in the second half of the year. From a national perspective, the situation in the United Kingdom was the best. Since President Roosevelt implemented an inflationary monetary policy in the United States, the national economy has suddenly become active. However, it is difficult to say whether this artificial result can be maintained for a long time. Due to currency contraction in France, although production has slightly increased, prices have continued to fall. Germany has also made progress in recent years. Japan, due to the benefits of exchange rate depreciation, has seen continued rapid progress in production and trade. The Soviet Union began its second five-year plan this year and has laid a solid foundation for the coming year.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Overview of the Domestic Economy <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the overview of the domestic economy in 1933, although the economic situation in various countries in the world has shown signs of recovery this year, China's economic situation has deteriorated further than before. In the past few years, the world's economy has declined, prices have fallen, industry and commerce have been depressed, and trade has declined. China's price level, due to the impact of falling international commodity prices, could have declined along with it. However, because China is a silver-using country, the rate of decline in the price of silver exceeded the general price decline in gold standard countries. China's purchasing power was further reduced by the price of silver, and the national situation showed no signs of improvement. Not only was the Northeast not recovered, but there was almost no moment of stability even within the borders. At the beginning of the year, there was the loss of Yuguan, the fall of Rehe, and the unrest in Beiping and Tianjin, followed by the Chahar incident, the Yellow River flood, and the Fujian coup at the beginning of winter, leaving the people with no opportunity to rest and recuperate. The rural economy became increasingly bankrupt, the people's purchasing power became increasingly weak, and commodity prices continued to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Trade Report Published <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has been publishing a trade report every six months since 1932, detailing the domestic and foreign economic overview and China's foreign trade situation. Since its publication, it has been highly praised by society. The trade report for the third and fourth quarters of 1933 has now been published. The entire book consists of more than 120 pages, approximately 80,000 words, divided into two parts. The first part records the international economic overview and the domestic economic overview. The second part details the import and export trade figures, the trade of import and export commodities by country, and the trade of import and export commodities by port, and includes 58 types of statistical tables and 6 statistical diagrams. It is an important reference book for those who are concerned about China's foreign trade. In addition to submitting the report to the Ministry of Industry and distributing it to various agencies, there are not many copies left. The previous trade reports published by the bureau led to numerous requests from people from all walks of life, and later requests could not be fulfilled. In order to impose a slight restriction, each copy is now charged 5 jiao in silver. Those who are concerned about China's international trade should purchase it as soon as possible to avoid missing out.</p>

<p>The collection of land taxes in Shanghai was transferred from the Land Bureau to the Finance Bureau on April 1. The Finance Bureau has found that the amount of overdue land taxes in various districts of the city is quite large. Therefore, it ordered the tax collection police chief, Ding Zhaorong, to summon the district chiefs and tax collection police officers from all districts of the city to the Land Tax Collection Office in South Shanghai the day before yesterday. Director Zhang of the Second Section, representing the Director of the Bureau, addressed the police officers, stating that the amount of land taxes owed by landlords and businesses in the city over the years is considerable. As the city's budget is short, the police officers should urge the collection of these overdue taxes as soon as possible. You are now given a deadline of one month to collect the full amount. If there is any deliberate delay, you are allowed to select the most serious cases and report them for prosecution. The police officers followed the instructions and departed.</p>

<p>Dai Gengxin, a magnate in the business world, has spared no effort in promoting domestic cigarettes. The China Huacheng Tobacco Company, which he operates, has been thriving after more than a decade of struggle. Its annual turnover reaches more than 20 million national currency, and it pays more than 7 million yuan in taxes to the government each year. Under the current situation where foreign cigarettes flood the Chinese market, the company has recovered considerable rights and interests. Considering the further development and improvement of domestic cigarettes, Mr. Dai has decided to go abroad on the 11th of this month to conduct on-site investigations in Europe and the United States for reference. According to Mr. Dai's remarks yesterday, the purpose of this trip abroad is to investigate and study the production and management of cigarette manufacturing plants in various countries, visit major international tobacco-producing areas, and conduct on-site inspections.

Then he will go to other countries in Europe and the United States. The planned duration of the trip is six months. It is said that Mr. Dai has hired Dr. Qian Chengxu as a consultant for this trip abroad in order to obtain more practical and accurate results. In addition, Zhu Lianqi and Xu Zhengxian will also accompany him.

<p>The New Voice Society reports that since the water was cut off in Peideli, Xinzhapu Road, although negotiations have been held with the water company, there has been no effect. Attorney Wang Xiangu, following the wishes of the representatives of the neighborhood, gave the water company 24 hours to restore the water supply, otherwise they would take appropriate measures. The Xinzhapu Police Station of the Public Concession, fearing a conflict, dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress it. In the morning, tenants in the neighborhood asked the church for water, but the priest refused to connect the hose, which led to a dispute. Fortunately, no trouble was caused. Yuan Ludeng and Jiang Yiping, Chinese Directors of the Public Concession Taxpayers' Association, seeing yesterday's report of the increasingly tense situation of the water cutoff in the neighborhood, feared that both sides would go to extremes. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, they went to the water company with Feng Bingnan and others to negotiate the restoration of the water supply. Regarding the water fee, it is guaranteed by the tenants in cash. The company has not yet fully accepted it and is still under negotiation.</p>

The Hankou branch has also been open for several years. In addition to the Shanghai head office on Beijing Road, which already has a self-built building, it is recently learned that the company also plans to build a seven-story cement building on Hubei Street in Hankou. The foundation was purchased last year, and the drawings will be completed soon. They are currently looking for a contractor. Furthermore, the company, recognizing the increasing prosperity of the western district of Shanghai, plans to build more than fifty modern three-story Western-style houses opposite the McTyeire School in Yidingpan Road in order to meet the needs of society.

<h3 id="e185">Method for Changing Inspection of Medicines: To Benefit Travelers and Alleviate Merchants' Difficulties, Shanghai Municipal <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the New Medicine Association stating that according to a letter from member Zhongfa Pharmacy, it was learned that the police stationed at the North Station are detaining travelers carrying Western medicines, regardless of whether they are prohibited or not, and transferring them to the court. After the medicines have been sent to the Municipal Health Bureau for testing, a verdict will be made. When the association first heard about this, it was very surprised. Just yesterday, a retail customer purchased two pounds of salicylic acid and took a train to Xi. He was also caught in this trouble. Later, the customer managed to notify the association.</p>
<p>After sending staff to explain to the district, they were released on bail. It was claimed that during the detention, there were many other detained people, and a large number of goods from various Chinese, Western, and international brands were confiscated. It seems that many people have been affected. Under such circumstances, customers from other cities will not dare to come to Shanghai to purchase goods, and the impact on our industry will be significant. Even the police officers in the district feel that this method is troublesome and advocate that our industry association should forward a letter to the municipal chamber of commerce, which will then send a letter to the municipal government, ordering the health bureau to appoint special personnel to be stationed at the station to assist in the inspection, so that they can be identified. This will not only avoid increasing the suffering of legitimate merchants and travelers,</p>
<p>and it will also be possible to effectively combat the transportation of prohibited drugs. This relief method is indeed urgent, so the association is writing based on the facts and requesting that the municipal chamber of commerce immediately forward a letter to the municipal government, urging it to change the inspection policy, or order the health bureau to send personnel to inspect with the police, so that they can be distinguished on the spot, in order to benefit travelers and alleviate merchants' difficulties, etc. The association has found that the inspection of medicines must be carried out by someone who recognizes poisonous drugs in order to make a detailed identification. If medicines are seized as soon as they are seen, regardless of whether they are prohibited or not, and all of them must be tested to determine whether they are prohibited, then merchants and civilians will suffer endlessly. Therefore, the association is writing to your association to forward it to the municipal government, urgently ordering the health bureau to add personnel who are familiar with medicines to be stationed at the station for inspection, so as to avoid disturbances, etc.</p>

<p>Two books published by Kaiming Bookstore, "Grammar and Composition," were discovered to be pirated. The person who confessed to the piracy, Yang Jingye, was arrested by the Huishan Police Station, and 1,000 copies of the pirated books were seized at the Datong Binding Factory on Dalianwan Road. The police station filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a retrial was held in the third court of the first division of the Shanghai Special District Local Court. First, the police station's lawyer stated that the printer of the book, Wang Lansheng, the owner of Hongxing Printing Factory, had been summoned. According to the defendant Yang Jingye's confession at the police station, the original book was first submitted to the printing factory for printing, and then the cover and copyright page were also submitted to the factory for printing separately. Although Wang Lansheng did not know which company published the book when printing the original book, the cover and copyright page clearly had the Kaiming Bookstore trademark and the words "Published by Kaiming Bookstore." Therefore, Wang Lansheng is actually an accomplice. However, the book's binder, Chen Zhaozhi, and the cover printer, Yin Chunrong, are also related to this case. They were not summoned and should be rescheduled for another hearing. Judge Zhan then asked the defendant Yang Jingye about his confession, which was consistent with the police station lawyer's statement. He also asked the second defendant, Wang Lansheng, who claimed that the book was submitted to him for printing by Chen Weisheng (Zhaohuan) of Wenshu Bureau. The book was only called "National Language." After it was printed, the book was taken out of the Datong Binding Factory, and the paper plates were sent to Wenguang Bookstore. However, the cover and copyright page were not printed by the factory, etc. Later, the plaintiff Kaiming Bookstore's representative lawyer, Cha Renwei, claimed that the book's paper plates were important evidence in the case. Also, Chen Weisheng of Wenguang Bookstore is an important criminal in the case and should be arrested and investigated. The court announced that the retrial would be held next Friday.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Domestic Electrical Appliances Are Not Inferior to Imported Goods <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Domestic electrical appliances have made rapid progress in recent years, which has led to price cuts and oppression from foreign competitors. In April last year, foreign electrical light bulbs were heavily discounted. However, the Yabuer brand light bulbs, made in China, did not drop in price due to the support of the Chinese people. In July of the same year, foreign light bulbs were discounted for the second time, and Yabuer brand light bulbs did not drop in price again. This year, foreign light bulbs have made a third drastic price cut. Yabuer brand light bulbs still maintain the same price without any reduction. From this, we can see that the stability of prices depends entirely on the quality of the products as the standard. Recently, the Yabuer electric fan has been certified by the Engineering Research Institute of the National Central Research Institute to be energy-saving, durable, and not prone to overheating. It is reported that the factory has photographed the original certificate and disclosed it in various newspapers.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Gao Xiaochen Punches Tao Jiayao, Tao Suffers Internal Injuries and Vomits Blood, Court Reopens for Trial After Recess - Gao is Ordered to be Released on Bail for Assault in Court - <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Tao Jiayao, a Jiangxi native residing at No. 1877, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, previously filed a private prosecution against Gao Xiaochen in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for fraud. After several summonses by the court, the details were reported in previous newspapers. This case was continued for trial again in the afternoon of yesterday. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. Originally presided over by Judge Tu Shenjie, the case was transferred to Judge Xiong Huiping of the same level, so a renewed trial was declared. After questioning both parties about their age, origin, and occupation, Gao Xiaochen, the plaintiff, stated the reasons for the prosecution. The judge asked Tao, "You and the plaintiff are friends of many years, why must you litigate? Can both parties make concessions and reconcile to avoid litigation fatigue?" Tao replied, "I am nearly seventy years old and have been sued for criminal fraud for no reason. I am unwilling to accept this. I have already filed a counterclaim for false accusation. If you consider friendship, Jiayao is willing to guarantee the plaintiff's loan of one thousand yuan from Hengli Bank, which I will repay on his behalf." Then, the lawyers of both parties debated for a long time. The court ordered both parties to retire and try to reconcile outside, pending a rescheduled hearing. Thereupon, both parties complied and retired, and the judge also announced the adjournment. However, as Tao Jiayao stepped out of the courtroom and was walking halfway down the stairs, Gao Xiaochen, the plaintiff, suddenly became angry and rushed up, punching Tao's back violently. Fortunately, two bailiffs, No. 529 and No. 93, saw it and stepped forward to stop him, preventing Tao from falling. Gao also stopped. After Tao went downstairs and retreated into the lawyer's lounge, he vomited blood due to internal injuries.</p>
<p>At that time, Tao's lawyers, Luo Jiaheng, Wang Zaoshi, and Li Guozhen, witnessed the situation and immediately reported to Judge Xiong, who then reopened the second court and summoned Gao Xiaochen to the case, reprimanding Gao for being so unreasonable and committing assault in the court. He was ordered to be released on bail, pending Tao Jiayao filing another lawsuit. It is reported that Tao's injuries are quite serious, and he is now at home seeking medical treatment. At the same time, he has asked Lawyer Luo et al. to draft a petition and submit it to the court, requesting an injury examination, and filing a private prosecution against Gao Xiaochen for assault.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Throws Feces at a Lawyer, Fortunately, a Briefcase Provided a Shield - This Actually Happened in Court <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>A lawyer from a certain law firm at No. 368 Jiangxi Road, whose business is usually quite prosperous, inevitably made enemies. Yesterday morning, the lawyer was entrusted by Sheng Yu, the former manager of the Qian Sanxin Yarn Factory, to go to the First Special District District Court to defend Sheng in a case where he was accused by the factory's workers. At 11:45, the case was being heard in the Eleventh Court. The lawyer, dressed in legal robes and carrying a briefcase, went straight to the Eleventh Court from the lawyer's lounge. Unexpectedly, he was surrounded by eight plaintiff workers accusing Sheng Yu as he approached the entrance to the court, their momentum fierce. Seeing this, the lawyer, fearing that these people might take some drastic action, explained in advance that he was only representing Sheng on duty and did not ask about other issues. If there were any expressions, they should be directed to Sheng. Unexpectedly, at this moment, two people in the crowd suddenly held huge packages wrapped in yellow paper and threw them at the lawyer's face. The lawyer had been prepared, so he immediately raised the briefcase he was carrying to shield his head and face. As the paper packages collided, the paper package immediately broke, and the contents were all filth, splashing on the lawyer's head, face, and body. The thrower, still unsatisfied, continued to try to force the remaining package into the lawyer's mouth. Fortunately, the briefcase provided a shield, not tasting the fragrance. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the thrower left calmly. At that time, because the lawyer did not make a sound, no one paid attention. It was not until the perpetrator had gone far away that the lawyer reported to the court authorities and requested an investigation. It is unexpected that in a place of judicial dignity and strict security, such an illegal madman would commit such an outrageous act, which is truly shocking.</p>

<p>The Rixin Hotel at No. 31 Avenue Dubail, French Concession, was opened by Xu Arong from Ningbo. On the 2nd of this month, a male and a female traveler suddenly came to the hotel. The man was named Xu Kecheng, 29 years old, from Hubei, a big manager, and the woman was surnamed Che, 23 years old. They opened room No. 16 on the fourth floor of the hotel, with a daily room rate of four corners. For two days, there was nothing unusual. Unexpectedly, at about 6 o'clock last night, Yang Xiaocui, the waiter of the hotel, suddenly heard a cry for help from the fourth floor. He immediately ran up to check and saw the man and woman lying in pools of blood, gasping and moaning. Yang saw that a tragedy had occurred and immediately ran out to report the arrest and transfer the report to the police station, who sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. On the floor, there was a sharp knife for peeling fruits. The woman had three injuries on her chest, right shoulder, and forehead. The man had four knife wounds on his throat and other parts. They were immediately taken to Guangci Hospital. According to the post-incident investigation, the man currently lives in a pavilion room at No. 44 Yongyu Lane, Jianle Road. Four years ago, he had once been familiar with the woman and then left. Now they have reunited. As for the cause of the tragic death, it was caused by economic pressure.</p>

<p>Cheng Rongde, 47 years old from Sijing, has been setting up a fish stall in the Nine Acres Vegetable Market. He has a son named Ada, who is now 17 years old. He is idle and often associates with hooligans. He often asks his parents for money to spend, and if he doesn't get it, he scolds them arbitrarily. Recently, he has even violently beaten his elders. Although Rongde and his wife have repeatedly taught and beaten him, Ada is quite strong and has been beaten and humiliated. Even last winter, Rongde was beaten by Ada, causing a hole in the corner of his eye, almost blinding him. Therefore, Rongde and his wife hate him to the core, thinking that it is better not to have such an unfilial son. However, they cannot drive him away, so they have a new plan to kill the son. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 pm yesterday, Rongde was drunk and his son Ada again asked his parents for money. Rongde thought that his son had grown up without earning money, but instead wanted to ask his parents for money to spend. What is the use of such a bad son? Suddenly, he had a murderous intention. Unexpectedly, Ada punched his father again. Rongde grabbed a sharp blade and stabbed Ada under his left armpit, about several inches deep. Ada was in extreme pain and fell into a pool of blood. Rongde intended to kill his son, so he did not allow rescue. When Li Zhi, the nineteenth watchman of the area, arrived, he took the injured Cheng Ada to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury is quite serious and may be fatal. However, Rongde went out after killing his son. When Rongde returned at 7 pm, the police arrested him and took him to the office for questioning. After questioning by Director Shen, the case involved killing a son and causing injury, and he was ordered to be handed over to the General Bureau for handling according to the law.</p>

<p>At about 7:30 pm yesterday, the Fifth District Third Sub-Office of Zhabei suddenly received a call from the Avenue Haig Public Concession police station, stating that Jiang Ali, a Gaoyou native, 32 years old, had voluntarily sought treatment at Tongren Hospital for a gunshot wound at about 7 pm, claiming that he had been ambushed at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Yangjia Creek Road. When asked about his address and occupation, he was vague. Therefore, the hospital detained him and reported to the police station, saying that the place was under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District Third Sub-Office, so they were notified, hoping to thoroughly investigate. After receiving the news, the sub-office immediately sent police detectives to investigate the Yangjia Creek Road area and asked the shops to inquire whether they had heard or witnessed any shooting cases. The shops all said that there had been no changes. The detectives went to various roads to check for bloodstains on the ground, but were disappointed. At the same time, no bullets or shells were found. Therefore, they suspected and immediately returned to the office to report. At the same time, the director of the sub-office went to the police station with the detectives to Tongren Hospital to question Jiang in detail about the cause of the injury. He claimed that he had come to Shanghai from Gaoyou with his wife the day before yesterday and was currently living at the house of his friend Xie Meichang at No. 6 Tianyi Lane, Tiantong Road, Zhabei. This afternoon, when passing through the intersection of Avenue Haig and Yangjia Creek Road, he was shot and hit in the abdomen. He had no occupation. When asked about other things, he was vague. The director of the sub-office immediately returned to the sub-office and sent police to Tianyi Lane to ask his friend Xie Meichang. He learned that Jiang Ali had returned home on foot after being injured. His wife discovered that he was injured and asked him to seek medical treatment. How he was injured, he didn't know at all. Therefore, this case was still a mess when the reporter drafted the manuscript. The suspicious point is that Jiang Ali claimed to have come to Shanghai the day before yesterday and was very poor. Why did he have four pawn tickets from pawnshops on Avenue Haig in the French Concession and other places, totaling more than thirty yuan, and the earliest one was pawned on March 15th? At the same time, why was there no trace of bullet shells or gunshots? Therefore, others speculated that Jiang Ali's injury may have been caused by infighting among accomplices.</p>

<p>For the convenience of passengers, the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration will, from May 10th, issue joint tour round-trip tickets for the two lines, as well as tour round-trip tickets for each station on this line. Whether it is the outbound or return trip, it can be used on any day within the validity period. The valid return date is calculated from the date of departure of the train, not the date of arrival. For example, a revolving guest holds a Shanghai North Station to Nanjing round-trip ticket sold on May 1st. The return portion is valid for the train to Shanghai from Nanjing on the night of the 7th at 12 o'clock. Although the ticket has expired when it arrives in Shanghai, it is still not considered expired because the train departs within the seventh day of validity. Also, the return portion does not need to be re-stamped with the date and train number at the station. When passengers purchase this round-trip ticket, if they declare that they need to stop midway, the station selling the round-trip ticket can also handle it separately.</p>

The mediation result was presided over by Yuan Hongjun, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: (1) The record of the 7-3 foreign code decided by the Social Bureau in November of the 19th year of the Republic of China will be abolished from May 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. (2) From now on, duck slaughtering households will pay the industry account, all calculated at a 97% discount on the large foreign exchange (however, goslings will still be calculated at the old rules, at full foreign exchange), but in the future, when the government abolishes small foreign exchanges and implements subsidiary coins, accounts will be paid at full foreign exchange (3) Transactions between both parties are limited to members who have joined the same industry association. If the duck slaughtering households have not joined the Duck Slaughtering Operations Industry Association, the chicken and duck industry shall not trade with them. The same applies to chicken and duck industries that have not joined the Chicken and Duck Industry Association (the members of the same industry association of both parties are subject to the list notified by each association) (4) When goods are sold by the industry, they shall be collected as they are bought. If the peddler has a shortage of tail coins to find, it shall be cleared at the end of the month, and shall not be delayed. (5) When paying accounts, payment checks shall be paid. The maximum period is ten days. Small foreign exchanges shall be subject to market spreads, and shall not be arbitrarily raised or under pressure on market prices (6) Peddlers on both sides shall not trade privately (7) After these conditions are signed, if any member of either party violates them, the same industry association of each industry shall be responsible for supervising their implementation to avoid disputes.

Later, after Wang repeatedly pleaded, the fine was reduced to 1,000 yuan. It is reported that the headquarters will send the two criminals, Wang and Yang, to Suzhou Army Prison for execution in the near future.</p>

<p>The woman, Lu Gao, was 29 years old, from Wuxi, living at No. 174 Xinzha Road. Her husband, Lu Gengsheng, was a butcher at the Suxi Pig Slaughtering Company. The couple had been married for several years and had six children. They were usually very harmonious. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, Lu blamed his wife for being lazy because the room was unclean. The woman was also unwilling to submit, so the two argued with each other. Later, after thinking about it, the woman became resentful and suddenly had the idea of ​​hating the world. She secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. After her husband noticed, he immediately took her to the Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died soon after. The hospital reported to the Xinzha police station, who sent Chinese detective Jiang Juwu to investigate, and then the body was entered into the Feilun Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District District Court, together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, came to the station to examine the body. According to Xie Kunsheng's testimony, he was 37 years old, and the deceased was his niece. He said that she had a quarrel with her husband the day before yesterday, which led to her short-sightedness. There were no beatings or other incidents at the time. Her husband is not here because he has something to do. Please give her the body for burial. Guo Jun got the supply, and then instructed that the dead Lu Gao was a woman, and she had indeed died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to Xie Kunsheng to guarantee that he would take it back for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Overview of the Work of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration in the First Quarter of the 23rd Year <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>1. Introduction: Overview of the work in this quarter, from January 1st to March 31st of the 23rd year. At the beginning of the 22nd year, this bureau once revealed its policy outline, dividing the consolidation into active and passive parts, and the construction into spiritual and material parts. The work this year will continue to be carried out in accordance with this policy. The business of this railway is better in passenger transport than freight transport, and passenger transport is mostly third and fourth-class passengers, while freight transport is mostly less-than-carload freight. Therefore, the bureau's future consolidation and construction will pay special attention to promoting the business of third and fourth-class passengers and less-than-carload freight. The bureau has not been able to devote much effort to employee welfare undertakings in the past year due to the urgency of restoring business. This year, it plans to actively promote it.</p>
<p>2. Improving Administration: Implementing the standard weights and measures system, convening statistical meetings, and stipulating the method of compiling and publishing periodic reports.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Implementing the Standard Weights and Measures System <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>This railway has long implemented the standard weights and measures system, such as kilometers for the road line and kilograms for freight weighing. However, in other parts, most of them still use the inconsistent old Chinese system or the unscientific British and American systems. Since the National Government promulgated the Measurement Law of the Republic of China and stipulated a unified procedure, this railway is located in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and should have completed the unification before the end of the 20th year. However, due to various reasons, it has not been implemented. Then, the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Incident broke out, and the case was shelved again. In April of the 22nd year, an order was issued to select members from various departments to form a committee to prepare for implementation. At the same time, the engineering department compiled and printed a conversion table of weights and measures for backup. At the same time, all important drawings and material lists, etc., were revised and marked in meters by various departments, and the procedures were completed. Then, it was decided to completely switch to the new system from January 1st of the 23rd year and issued a general order for all departments to implement it uniformly.</p>

<p>Improving road affairs is based on statistics for more accurate comparison. In the past, the statistical work of the bureau was scattered in various departments, and the summary comparison was not enough to show the overall situation and exert its practical effect. Therefore, the general affairs department drafted various statistical tables, all using a monthly filling method, so that (1) when reference is needed in the middle of a year, the overall situation of each month can be obtained, and (2) after the end of a year, comparative statistical charts can be made to show the signs of its rise and fall. Then, it will be discussed with the relevant personnel of various departments on the method of supplying statistics every month, and the case of compiling the national statistical general report will be resolved together (to be continued).</p>

<p>To the Editor: We have read a news item in your newspaper's local news column about the import of Japanese sugar, which stated that more than 60 sugar merchants, according to a certain estimate, will have some sugar firms go bankrupt by the end of May. After checking, although the business of our industries has been sluggish and the profits have been meager due to the decline in people's strength last year, there are no families with huge losses. The closure of several companies in the first year was purely for other reasons. Now, the statement that several sugar firms will go bankrupt by the end of May is not known from what speculation. This is published, and it is inevitable that it is absurd, but it is very harmful to the credit and future of our industry. Please correct it quickly to avoid confusion. This is our sincere hope. Sincerely, Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, May 4th.</p>

<p>(I continued)</p>
<p>- Answer to Mr. Wang Renkan -</p>
<p>The points raised in Mr. Wang's letter almost cover the entire new Chinese literature movement. If we want to answer in detail, we need a large work of 100,000 words. Now, we are limited by the length of this column. Although we strive for accuracy in our views, the development may not be exhaustive. This is what we want to ask Mr. Wang and all readers to forgive in advance.</p>
<p>To understand the literary achievements of the "May Fourth Movement," we must first understand the social significance of the "May Fourth Movement." Some old remnants of the "May Fourth" era often boast that the "May Fourth Movement" was launched by the "New Literature Movement." This statement not only aims to raise their own value and deliberately reverse the cause-and-effect relationship, but also hinders our fundamental understanding of the "May Fourth Movement." The "May Fourth Movement" is clearly an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement of the emerging national bourgeoisie. The result of the First World War made the European imperialists temporarily unable to take care of this colony, giving the national bourgeoisie a considerable opportunity for development. This aroused the consciousness of a part of the advanced bourgeois intellectuals on the one hand, but on the other hand, it threatened the emerging Japanese capital imperialism, making it have to take the opportunity to further attack China! The Twenty-One Demands for the destruction of China were put forward; the feudal warlords and bureaucrats surrendered. The "May Fourth Movement" inevitably broke out under these opposing circumstances. Social foundations were shaken, and the superstructure was shaken. Although the so-called New Culture Movement often manifested itself concretely before the actual movement, and although the development of the cultural movement was enough to promote the development of the actual movement, the success of the French Revolution did not rely entirely on Rousseau's call to "return to nature," but on the growth and strength of the French bourgeoisie itself. Using this to illustrate the "May Fourth Movement," we cannot say that the "May Fourth Movement" was launched by the "New Culture Movement." We should say that the "New Culture Movement" was launched through the "May Fourth Movement." If we do not grasp this point and do not start from a class perspective to understand the significance of the "May Fourth Movement" and the mutual relationship between the "May Fourth Movement" and the "New Culture Movement," we cannot solve the following problems.</p>
<p>What exactly did the "May Fourth Movement" achieve in literature? If we answer this question more concretely, we can say that it only raised questions and did not solve any problems at all, that is, there were no achievements. What Mr. So-and-so called "on the road to success" and "establishment" is a kind of self-deceiving exaggeration used to cover up his own escape, surrender, and weakness in running back to the old home of "organizing the national past." This reason, of course, does not blame Mr. So-and-so and similar intellectuals, but is determined by the fate of their class. The Chinese national bourgeoisie was cultivated by capital imperialism on the one hand and transformed by indigenous warlords and bureaucrats on the other. They are inherently characterized by comprador and feudal characteristics. Although they once stretched out their arms in the "May Fourth Movement" for the benefit of their own class, their undeniable timidity made them unable to last and unable to fight to the death. Once the struggle became sharp and their own interests were harmed, they would not hesitate to return to the arms of their old masters and willingly be slaves. This is reflected in the literary movement, and naturally there is no exception. Let's look at its achievements: From the beginning, the movement itself exposed many fundamental defects. First, the bourgeois intellectuals who led the movement did not have firm self-confidence and only regarded the movement as a "try." This can often be seen in the remarks of many gentlemen at that time. Therefore, they neither saw their future nor were willing to embark on their future. They were satisfied as long as they changed "zhī hū zhě yě" to "de me ne ma." Second, there was only the form of movement but no substantial content of movement. As far as vernacular is concerned, this was undoubtedly a weapon of assault for the national bourgeoisie to realize the two major demands of "science" and "democracy." Undoubtedly, it itself has a strong anti-imperialist and anti-feudal significance, but the leaders at the time only limited the problem to the discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of vernacular and classical Chinese, and could not attach more important social purpose consciousness, which caused it to completely stagnate in form. "De me ne ma" is used universally, but literary works containing struggle are ultimately not available. These two shortcomings cannot but be specially mentioned in examining the achievements of the literary movement at that time.</p>
<p>The result of the "May Fourth Movement" was to make the new literary movement! Or the vernacular movement, penetrated into the student and petty citizen strata of the petty bourgeoisie and expanded the influence of the new literary movement. This is a fact, but at the same time, the result of the May Fourth Movement further exposed the ugliness of those upper-class intellectuals, so they differentiated, wavered, and ended the life of their literary movement at this stage. Some of the more progressive elements among them took further direct action in politics, needless to say. The other part obediently retreated to their old home, which is what Mr. So-and-so and others call "organizing the national past." "Organizing the national past" can never be compared with the Soviet Union's acceptance of literary heritage. The Soviet Union's proposal to accept literary heritage was because the social foundation of the new literature was extremely strong and was based on the view of making this emerging literature reach its peak. Otherwise, why didn't they raise this question before the completion of the first five-year plan? Mr. So-and-so and others are clearly surrendering to the construction literature, avoiding the literary struggle in reality and hiding in a dead end. Textual research on Dream of the Red Chamber and blindly praising Awakening the World are not only of no help to new literature, but in fact, they are enough to help the tiger commit crimes, intentionally or unintentionally fulfilling the obligation of the feudal literary Mandarin Duck Butterfly School. This group of intellectuals had already left the camp of the new literary movement after the "May Fourth Movement." They have been buried by the times.</p>
<p>In addition, the only ones who can be our object of study are the neutral group wandering in the artistic palace (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e227">Records of the Faint Fragrance of Imperial Incense <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>- Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>From the above Q&amp;A, readers may ask, then what qualifications are required to be a railway official under the rule of the Manchu Qing government? The answer is very simple. As long as you can buy it with money, you are qualified! As for how they can do it, as long as they have the means to live, it's fine. For example, my brother Xunling, he is acting as a railway supervisor: but what is he supervising? Not only do I not know, even he himself does not know! The reason why he was able to get this position was simply because he was a student who graduated from a certain military school in France!</p>
<p>On the surface, the Empress Dowager was not only often deceived by her courtiers, but also seemed to be deceived by the officials of the railway department. In fact, how could she not know? She just pretended not to hear it! Because these people were as incurable to her as all the tedious etiquette in the palace: it was what she had to endure. But I can make a judgment, based on my experience in the palace, the Empress Dowager can be said to know everything about the various characteristics of her officials, such as arrogance, vanity, and pretense, and knows them very accurately!</p>
<p>When we were watching her talk to Meng Fuxiang, we believed that there were only two thoughts in her mind at that time: one thought was to drive him out and never see him again: the other thought was to laugh at him in his face. But she also knew that if she really drove Meng Fuxiang away, the one who replaced him might be even more unbearable. Then laugh at him? ... No! Because the dignity of the Empress Dowager is what she has to maintain!</p>
<p>Although there is no court in the car every day, it seems to be a holiday; but all the etiquette must still be maintained as before. Only those of us who serve as female officials are more fortunate. Because if we find something funny and want to laugh in our hearts, we only need to return to our own car and we can laugh out loud!

<p>- Yanqiao</p>
<p>The three waterfalls of Shiliang Longqiu Shimentong are very famous. Yuan Zicai's Records of the Three Waterfalls in Western Zhejiang describe them vividly, but unfortunately the transportation to these three places is inconvenient and it is not easy to visit them. This time, the Five-Province Transportation Tour Association included these scenic spots in the first line of the plan. Beforehand, an interview team was organized, including writers, painters, photographers, journalists, etc., to prepare a travel guide for the participants to refer to. My friend Chen Ziqing was one of those who was called upon. He came the day before yesterday and said: He almost lost his life, because he is a painter and often has a unique vision. When he sees a scenic spot, he quickly sketches it, forgetting himself and ignoring the dangerous situation under his feet. On a cliff in Longqiu, he slipped on the green moss, and his body was hanging down. Below was an unfathomable abyss, and if he fell down, he would definitely become mincemeat. Fortunately, there was a sedan bearer next to him who immediately grabbed him, and he was not "hate for missing his foot." However, in this trip, the landscape he obtained was enough to greatly improve his painting skills. Therefore, he wants to write the mounds in his chest into clouds and smoke on paper, and actively sell paintings with his classmate Wu Hufan in Shanghai, absolutely commercialized, and keep his promises, with no celebrity airs at all. They have a grand vision to combine the good landscape and good paintings of China into one piece and popularize them to the masses. This idea can be regarded as new and transparent.</p>
<p>Ziqing also said that the highway construction in western Zhejiang is very hard. There are still more than 2,000 people working on it, all opening up roads from the mountains, and the project is certainly not small. If the whole country develops like this, the future is very promising. Among the many valleys, Fangyan is the most peculiar. Fangfo is made of countless cubic stone blocks, which is not found elsewhere.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Chinese people are happy to wear watches. However, the contribution of watches to Chinese people is only to the extent of "wearing," and it seems that there is no "application," because Chinese people simply "refuse to be on time."</p>
<p>However, watches must be worn, which is strange!</p>
<p>Although the invitation card states that the seat will be entered at six o'clock, the phenomenon of you arriving on time is "extremely无人," the servant gives you a</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 28: Coincidental Viewing, Foolish Passion for a Handkerchief, Earnest Inquiries About Illness, Misunderstanding Leads to a Letter</p>
<p>He returned home, and his elder brother and sister-in-law also returned from the city by car. He went to the main room, exchanged a few polite words with them, and at dinner, forced down half a bowl of rice. Then, he quietly returned to his study, propped his head on the table, and peeked out the window. Seeing no one passing by, he rummaged through his clothes for a while and pulled out a white silk handkerchief. On the corner of this handkerchief were embroidered two small osmanthus flowers and three green leaves, a diminutive representation of Yang Guizhi's name, indicating it was his private possession. He held the silk handkerchief, flipped it over, and examined it twice, then sniffed it several times, finding the fragrance intoxicating and filling his heart with a sense of joy. Because he felt so delighted, he held the handkerchief tightly, lost in thought. He savored the memory of how the handkerchief came into his possession. He remembered that when he dared not look at Guizhi any longer, Guizhi took out this handkerchief from her bosom and gently dabbed it on her face twice. Then, seemingly carelessly, she took the handkerchief back with her left hand and tucked it under her left arm. However, the opening of her dress was on the right, so how could she tuck it in on the left? Therefore, after several attempts, the handkerchief remained in her hand. It seemed her entire attention was focused on the stage, so she was completely unaware of what was happening with her own person. After a long time, her hand, perhaps out of absentmindedness, let the handkerchief fall onto the back of the chair, and she continued to watch the performance. He originally dared not touch her private property, but even after the performance ended, she didn't seem to notice the handkerchief. After she got up, he picked up the handkerchief. Looking at it this way, perhaps she intentionally passed the handkerchief to me privately, which is not impossible. If I didn't pick it up, I would be ungrateful for her kindness. Ji Zhi sat in his study, pondering layer upon layer, and the more he thought, the more he felt Guizhi's affection was profound. Originally, she was already married, and her father-in-law treated her with great kindness. How could she show disloyalty at this time? She probably knows how tormented I am, so in her helplessness, she used this handkerchief to comfort me. Actually, it would be better if she didn't comfort me at all, because this kind of comfort only plunges me deeper into the sea of love. (377)</p>
<p>The somewhat indifferent glance seemed to say, "You poor thing!" Conversely, arriving late demonstrates your busy schedule, thus increasing your value. If you can "barely warm the seat" before taking a sip of wine and excusing yourself, offering profuse apologies for having to leave due to too many commitments, and then hurriedly rush off, then your generosity and extensive social circle will undoubtedly leave a "delicious aftertaste" for the "nine brothers" at the "round table" to savor and admire.</p>
<p>Chinese people, living in such a hypocritical social environment, how can they talk about "punctuality?" Moreover, most of their watches tell different times, each going its own way. If the "time" isn't accurate, how can there be any "punctuality?" This reminds me of another joke about "imported goods."</p>
<p>A Westerner invited a friend who had once broken an appointment. Ten minutes after the appointed time, his friend finally arrived, looking nonchalant. He angrily questioned his friend about his chronic tardiness. The friend showed him his watch, intending to protest. After some debate and a thorough check, it was proven that the latter's watch was inaccurate due to a loose spring. So he said seriously, "Friend, would you rather keep our friendship or keep this watch?" To have the issue of a watch involve friendship, truly hilarious to Chinese people!</p>

<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3 id="e234">Talking About Salted Duck Eggs <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Salted duck eggs are a very common food, and in the spring and summer seasons, they are especially good to eat with porridge in the morning. I remember a joke: "A certain son ate a salted duck egg and didn't know why. One day, he tasted salted duck and suddenly realized: 'So, salted duck eggs are laid by salted ducks!'"</p>
<p>Salted duck eggs made in Gaoyou are the most famous, commonly called Gaoyou eggs. When opened, this kind of egg is as red as amber and has oil flowing out. Its taste is rich and beautiful, incomparable. However, after being stored for a long time, the red turns black, with a different aroma, but many people still like to eat black yolk eggs. Moreover, those who wear black fragrant cloud gauze shirts and trousers with a white long gown are also called "black yolk eggs," a very apt comparison.</p>
<p>The Du method for making salted duck eggs involves mixing the brine from the year-end salted fish with rice straw ash, stirring it evenly, and then applying it to the washed fresh duck eggs. After about a week, they can be eaten. Some people also soak river sand in boiling salt water and apply it to the eggs, but it is not as rich and beautiful as the salted fish brine and rice straw ash. People in coastal areas all burn coal, and using coal ash as a substitute is even worse than river sand.</p>
<p>Salted duck eggs have a long history. Rong Zhai Sequel says: "The Jade Chapter and Tang Rhymes explain the character 杬 (yuan): a type of wood that grows in Yuzhang. Its juice can be used to preserve fruits and eggs without spoiling them. Exotic Things Records says: '杬 (yuan) means salted duck eggs, which are made by mixing the bark juice of the 杬 tree with salt.' Now, we have this everywhere in our hometown. It is like cocklebur and motherwort, not purely wood. When petty people fight, they take its leaves and rub them on the skin, causing it to turn red and swollen, falsely accusing their enemy of injury. As for preserving duck eggs, they also use it to dye the outside, making them look ochre in color."</p>
<h3 id="e235">A Note on Pig Blood Mushrooms <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zongtang</p>
<p>Hui Spring Mountain in Wuxi, with its nine peaks soaring high, surrounded by Tai Lake, boasts the beauty of springs, rocks, terraces, and pavilions. The mountain produces a type of mushroom called pig blood mushroom, which is fragrant, fresh, and tender, a unique style among wild mountain delicacies. It is a pity that few outside know about it and cannot taste this unique flavor.</p>
<p>Pig blood mushroom is a type of fungus, purple-red like blood, non-toxic, hence its name. Every year in April and mid-September, it grows among the pine firewood at the foot of Hui Mountain. Villagers from the mountain carry bamboo baskets to pick them. For one yuan, you can only buy a little over a pound, making the price quite expensive.</p>
<p>Pig blood mushrooms are best cooked with fresh bamboo shoots and bean curd, resulting in a delicious flavor, and the mushrooms are tender and pleasing. This dish is considered to be best prepared at a certain restaurant attached to the Jichang Garden in Hui Mountain. This garden is owned by the Qin family, and the Qing Emperor Qianlong once stayed there. Encircling Hui Mountain, with rippling waves and misty shadows, tall pines leaning over, and flying pavilions with flowing vermilion, it stands tall and majestic. If you want to taste this mountain delicacy, you can go to this garden, where, in addition to enjoying the special products of Hui Mountain, you can also admire the famous garden scenery, which is also a pleasure.</p>
<p>Cooking pig blood mushrooms with high-quality autumn oil, storing them in a ceramic jar, and using the oil to marinate tofu, which can be eaten with porridge in the morning, has a unique flavor, even better than shrimp roe soy sauce. Pig blood mushroom soup is extremely delicious and rich. All temples in Xiyi consider this a delicacy on their vegetarian banquets.</p>
<p>Also, pig blood mushrooms can be cooked with tofu skin, wheat gluten, and fresh bamboo shoots. Wheat gluten is a special product of Wuxi, rich in vitamins, which is beneficial for human nutrition.</p>
<p>In short, pig blood mushrooms should only be cooked with vegetarian ingredients to have a unique flavor. If cooked with meat dishes, they will taste bland.</p>

<p>Chinese Education Society Suggests to the Legislative Yuan Regarding the Constitution</p>
<h3 id="e260">It Should Be Stipulated That Education Funds Be Independent with a Minimum Percentage <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Education Society yesterday sent a letter to the Legislative Yuan suggesting that the Constitution should stipulate that education funds be independent, and that the word "minimum" should be added before the percentage, stating, "Respectfully submitted, we believe that education is a fundamental plan for establishing the nation. In this time of national decline and crisis, national revival and salvation depend on education. Whether education can develop depends on whether education funds can be independent and stable. Since the European War, all countries that have revived or rebuilt have generally established special chapters or articles on education in their constitutions, and many have made practical provisions regarding the sources and allocation of funds. Looking back at our country since the implementation of new education, there has never been a clear stipulation guaranteeing education funds. In recent years, foreign troubles have been frequent and internal disturbances have arisen from time to time. In fact, education funds have been affected by politics and military affairs, and there has been no stable situation. The misfortune of the country is also a crisis for education. Those engaged in education are compelled by enthusiasm and troubled by livelihood, and are trapped in a dilemma, with little way to be self-reliant or to help others. As a result, they change careers one after another and enter officialdom, which is common, and the national education suffers from it. It is difficult to revive and save the nation in this way. With this in mind, the Association resolved at its second board meeting to 'suggest to the Legislative Yuan that the special chapter on education in the Constitution should clearly stipulate the independence of education funds and guarantee that the percentage of education funds stipulated should have the word "minimum" added to prevent malpractices'. Therefore, we specially state the reasons, record the case, and send it to you, respectfully requesting that clear provisions be made in the special chapter on education in the Constitution to avoid the emptiness and disorder of education funds and to bring education to a healthy and stable state. This matter concerns national survival, and we hope that it will be adopted and implemented. We are eagerly awaiting this."</p>

<h3 id="e261">Demanding Modification of Entrance Examination Regulations <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing Electric Dispatch, 4th) Twenty-one student representatives from private middle schools in Beijing went to the Ministry of Education on the afternoon of the 4th to petition for permission to modify the middle school graduation examination regulations, requesting two points: (1) The graduation rate should be considered to be above 95%, and the examination results should be calculated with school grades accounting for 60%; (2) The results of the examination should be released two weeks later, and failures and make-up examinations should be held within the third week. Dai Yingguan, section chief of the Ministry of Education, received them and said that the examination regulations were issued to all provinces and cities for uniform compliance, and it would be inconvenient to modify them in one place. If there are any opinions, they must first be submitted to the Beijing municipal education administration for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Principal Huang of Qixia Declared Not Guilty: Lawyers Zhang Yipeng and Chuan Kuanglin Diligently Defended. The Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Federation Sent a Letter of Thanks <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Huang Zhifu, Principal of the Jiangsu Provincial Qixia Mountain Rural Normal School, is enthusiastic about education, and the extension projects he runs are particularly beneficial to society. Because of this, he was wronged by a petty person, a monk named Jiran from Qixia Temple, who had a bad reputation and repeatedly made trouble for the school, falsely accusing the principal in the Jiangning Court. The court repeatedly rejected the accusations. Last year, the monk again framed Principal Huang in a criminal case, accusing him again in the Jiangning District Court, buying witnesses and colluding to fabricate confessions in various ways, to the point where Huang lost the case and was sentenced to imprisonment. Huang felt humiliated for no reason and refused to endure it, so he appealed to the Suzhou High Court and asked lawyers Zhang Yipeng and Chuan Kuanglin to defend him according to the law. People in the education community throughout the province also rose up to help, and the truth became clear. A few days ago, the High Court declared Huang not guilty. All the principals of secondary schools in Jiangsu Province admired lawyers Zhang Yipeng and Chuan Kuanglin for enthusiastically protecting education, speaking out for justice, reversing the case, and overturning the original verdict. Yesterday, Cao Chu, Zhang Haicheng, Liu Hengjing, Shao Heting, Wu Zhidi, Zheng Tonghe, and Zhou Houhu, seven executive committee members of the Middle School Federation, representing all the principals, sent a letter to lawyers Zhang and Chuan expressing their gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Principal Peng of Songjiang Middle School Describes the Student Unrest <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang Middle School sent a letter saying, "To the esteemed editor of your newspaper: Recently, I read a report in the 'Education News' column of your newspaper on April 29th about the student unrest in the third grade of Songjiang Provincial Middle School, in which the students opposed the mid-term examination, claiming it was unnecessary. This is completely contrary to the Ministry's regulations and the school's rules. Article 2 of the school's temporary regulations on academic performance evaluation states that there is a mid-term examination, which has been approved by the Education Department with Instruction No. 12061 for reference. This method is not only commonly practiced in schools across the country for many years, but also is very consistent with the recent regulations of the Ministry of Education's middle school regulations, Article 51. It has been implemented for years without any objection. The Guidance Office scheduled the senior third grade mid-term examination to be held from March 26th to March 28th, arranged the schedule, and announced its implementation. Unexpectedly, the students of that grade only agreed to participate in the mid-term examinations for various elective courses, but refused the mid-term examinations for the three required subjects of Party Principles, Chinese Language, and English. When asked for their reasons, they had no answer. After repeated persuasion by the teachers of the Guidance Office and the class teachers, the grade sent a letter stating, 'The graduation trip of this grade is imminent. There is not enough time to prepare for the required subjects of this term. The completion of the elective courses is equivalent to a term examination. Students must fully prepare for credit purposes, so it is difficult to take care of the required subjects. We request that the Guidance Office change the arrangements and move the required subjects to after the spring break, which is convenient for both sides.' In view of this, the school did not reject their request for postponement.</p>
<p>I thought that from then on, it could be implemented on a regular basis. On April 18th, Wei Ji contacted the public affairs and asked for leave from the Education Department to go to Zhenjiang and then to Beijing. All school affairs were entrusted to the Deputy Director of Guidance Jiang Dongcheng. Then, the senior third grade mid-term examinations for Party Principles, Chinese Language, and English were scheduled to be held on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. According to the investigation, the students of that grade still refused, which was unreasonable. According to Article 57 of the Middle School Regulations, 'Students in the second semester of the third year of middle school may be exempted from the term examination, and the usual grades of each subject shall be used as the term grade.' If the grade's request is accepted and the mid-term examination is not held, the Chinese Language subject can be given credits according to the usual writing grades, but there is no way to calculate the scores for the Party Principles and English subjects. We are forced to ask the teachers to forge the scores, which not only destroys personal integrity, but also destroys educational administration. In fact, since there are no mid-term examination scores for these three subjects, there are no scores for the second semester of the third grade, and graduation cannot be allowed. This is why all the colleagues of the school insisted on the standard of the examination questions. Although special accommodation can be made, the mid-term examination is a must. Also, it is not true that a certain director saw a student sneaking out of the school one night and did not stop him on the spot. Wei Ji applied for leave from the Education Department on the 18th to go to Zhenjiang and then to Beijing. All school affairs were entrusted to the Deputy Director of Guidance Jiang Dongcheng. After lunch on the 19th, eleven senior third grade probation students, Tang Zeyi, Yu Shenrunmin, Huang Chaoguang, and students Cao Kongzhao and others, went to the theater without leave to seek entertainment. When the doorman tried to stop them, they lied and said they were visiting a certain meeting place. Later, after careful investigation by the Guidance Office, the truth was found out, and the students were confronted and confessed the truth. Colleagues in the Guidance Office felt that the situation was too serious to handle on their own. On April 24th, Wei Ji returned to school after completing the public affairs and handed it over to Wei Ji for verification. If entry and exit are free, school rules will inevitably be swept away. It is even more difficult to tolerate this kind of behavior occurring in the senior third grade. A meeting was immediately convened with the three directors of guidance, discipline, and affairs, the senior third grade teachers, class teachers, and other relevant personnel to discuss and decide to follow the Education Department's Instruction No. 252 on rectifying the academic style of the third grade, and to consider the students' previous academic performance in detail and to punish them separately by expulsion. The holding of the mid-term examination and the school rules are crucial and cannot be changed easily. The punishment of the students is deserved and not a harsh requirement. There are discrepancies between what your newspaper reported and the facts. Therefore, I specially request that you disclose the letter in order to correct it and avoid misunderstandings. I am very grateful for this." This is addressed to Mr. Editor-in-Chief of the Shanghai Shen Bao, Principal Peng Weiji.</p>

<p>(4) Health and Schooling. Almost everyone who can meet the requirements of schooling is not a few. Everyone thinks that the economy is the most important thing. In fact, the economy is still a secondary issue. It is not seen that many poor men with empty walls have succeeded in their studies since ancient times. Having no money does not necessarily prevent one from achieving academic success. Lacking wisdom is the fatal flaw in seeking knowledge. People who are unhealthy lack wisdom in nineteen out of ten cases. According to statistics, there is a great difference in the thinking ability and memory of unhealthy people and healthy people. You can understand by looking at these two tables (tables omitted). The table clearly indicates that only healthy people have excellent thinking ability, and only healthy people have excellent memory. Looking at the table on the impact of health on academic performance, the report shows that 50% of healthy people have excellent academic performance, 37% are of medium grade, and only 2% are listed as inferior. Conversely, among unhealthy people, 30 out of 100 are classified as inferior, and getting excellent grades is truly rare. According to a survey by L. WRapeer in the United States, 15% of students drop out due to physical problems, 16% repeat grades, and 17% are demoted. In this Shanghai municipal examination, many people fell ill and could not graduate. It is a pity that their efforts failed. Li Tingan, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, has been studying health education for many years. He told me that his nephew had tonsillitis and his academic performance deteriorated, repeating grades for two years out of three. After he detected the cause and cured it, his academic performance improved by leaps and bounds. These are all true facts. This is something everyone should realize. Only with a sound body and mind can one have a sound mind. Remember this saying, and it will be of great benefit to your studies.</p>
<h3 id="e277">(5) Health and Occupation <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>The common perception is that money, machines, and land are the only capital for engaging in an occupation. However, the most important capital is not money, machines, or land, but our health. This is because health is the source of wealth. The American Labor Association estimates that industrial workers lose a total of 248 million days of work each year due to illness. Including losses in production, land resources, medicine, and other expenses, the total amounts to 772.85 million US dollars. The British Royal Commission estimates that illness is the cause of poverty for 55% to 66% of the national population. Western scientists say that the demise of Greece was due to disease, and the demise of Rome was also due to disease. China, known as the "Sick Man of East Asia," needs no further mention. According to our health statistics, the average mortality rate per thousand people is 15 in foreign countries, while it is 30 in our country. Out of a population of 400 million, 6 million people die unjustly each year. Shanghai's total population is 3 million, so the number of people who die unjustly each year is almost twice the population of Shanghai. If we calculate the economic loss, each person spends at least 50 gold coins per year on average. If they die at the age of ten, each person will have spent at least 500 gold coins, excluding medical expenses. For every 6 million people, there is a loss of 3 billion gold coins. With an annual expenditure of 3 billion gold coins, what can China not accomplish? Using this amount to develop construction projects, we could build 100,000 li of asphalt roads, 30,000 li of railways, 800 factories, 5,000 hospitals, 100,000 elementary schools, and 600 water plants. If we develop these projects every year, we won't have to worry about the lack of occupations.</p>

<h3 id="e278">Measuring Transformer Voltage Under Load <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Repairmen and experimenters often want to calculate the voltage of a power transformer under a certain load. This is actually easy. Anyone with a basic understanding of arithmetic can solve it using the following simple formula.</p>
<p>(1) E = e - cRRI + RE, where E is the transformer voltage under load RI.</p>
<p>R is the total AC impedance of the secondary coil. (A·C Impedance)</p>
<p>e is the voltage of the transformer without load.</p>
<p>Ri is the total AC impedance of the load.</p>
<p>Figure 1 AB</p>
<p>Figure 2 VA</p>
<p>How to solve this formula? As shown in Figure 1, the value of e, measured without load at point AB, is 620 volts. The value of R, measured with an ohmmeter for DC resistance, is 400 ohms. (Although this value should be measured at 60 cycles AC, the difference is slight and this error point has little impact.) The resistance RI is a voltage divider with a resistance of 6,000 ohms. What should the transformer voltage be when the load is 6,000 ohms?</p>
<p>Solution: Substitute the measured values into the formula, and the calculated result is approximately 300 volts.</p>
<p>This method can be used to calculate the current in rectifiers and the plate circuits of various vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>For step-down transformers, the coil resistance can also be accurately measured with an ohmmeter. (For large power transformers, use a Wheatstone Bridge to measure their DC resistance.) The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>(2) R = eEII, where I is the current, in amperes. Example: A radio has four vacuum tubes whose filament current requires four amperes. As shown in Figure 2, when using six vacuum tubes, requiring six amperes, what is the voltage drop after the filament voltage drops?</p>
<p>Solution: The voltage e without load is 2.7 volts, and the voltage E with load is 2.25 volts. Substitute these values into the following formula:</p>
<p>R = 2.72.25·454 = 0.112 ohms. Once R is obtained, the voltage drop after step-down at six amperes should be: (3) EIER E = 2.7 (6X0.112) E = 2.03 volts.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Improving Antenna Coupling <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Li</p>
<p>If you want to make the tuning capacitors of a high-frequency amplification stage adjustable with a single shaft, the first difficulty is how to prevent the tuning circuit of the first high-frequency stage from being affected by the coupling of the antenna circuit and changing its wavelength range. Figure 1A shows the simplest tuning circuit. Its wavelength can be completely determined by the inductance of coil L1, the distributed capacitance, and the maximum and minimum capacitance of capacitor C1. The curve is uniform, as shown in Figure 2A. Now, use another coil L2 to replace the primary of an ordinary high-frequency transformer, so that it is coupled with L1 (Figure 1B). If L2 is open, the wavelength curve of C1 will not change at all. In actual circuits, for all high-frequency stages except the first stage, L2 is connected across the plate and screen grid of the previous high-frequency tube (Figure 1C). At this time, L2 and its associated circuits affect L1, increasing the inductance of L1, and the wavelength curve of C1 also becomes Figure 2B. Now, if the first high-frequency stage is to be adjusted with a single shaft, its wavelength curve must conform to B.</p>
<p>If the antenna is connected to this same primary coil L2, the effect of increasing the L inductance is even greater because the antenna inductance and capacitance are incorporated into the primary circuit. The three curves C, D, and E in Figure 2 represent the wavelength curves of C1 after connecting short, medium, and long antennas.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the L2 of the first high-frequency stage cannot be the same size as the L2 of other stages. Therefore, this high-frequency transformer must be specially designed, but even if it is well designed, it can only be applied to antennas of a certain length. To avoid this difficulty, L2 can use the same type as other stages, but another capacitor C3 is connected in parallel with it (Figure 1E). Match this capacitor so that it is equal to the interelectrode capacitance of the high-frequency tube plate and screen grid. In this way, its wavelength curve can still be consistent with (Figure 2B).</p>
<p>This circuit also needs to be connected in series with a coil L3 (Figure 1E) so that it can be coupled with the antenna, and the capacitance of C3 must be reduced to maintain the original characteristics of this circuit. If the antenna is coupled to L3 through L4 (Figure 1G), because the variation of inductance is gradually weakened from one circuit to another, even if the variation of L4 is extremely large, the effect on L1 is extremely weak. Experimental results show that if the tightness of the coupling can be properly matched, the wavelength curve of C, no matter what the length of the antenna, will always be consistent with Figure 2B. The most perfect circuit is Figure 1H, because it has properly matched all the coils and C3 can be omitted. The capacitance between coil L3 and the ground wire is sufficient to replace it.</p>
<p>The advantages of the above antenna coupling method are three:</p>
<p>(1) It can make the capacitor of the first high-frequency stage and other stages into a perfect single-shaft adjustment.</p>
<p>(2) The structure of all high-frequency transformers can be exactly the same.</p>
<p>(3) Only by changing the degree of antenna coupling can the volume be controlled.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Appearance of Ultra-Short Wave Miniature Vacuum Tubes <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Qing</p>
<p>In the past, when using vacuum tubes to receive ultra-short waves, the limit was about five meters. Above this, although special methods such as electronic oscillation could be used reluctantly, the operation was unstable and the sensitivity was poor, so there were many inconveniences in practical use. However, according to recent research, it is known that if a method can be found to keep a certain ratio between the two electrodes, the characteristics will not change regardless of how small the shape is. Even one that is about one-tenth of the current type can be used reliably even at ultra-high frequencies of 0.5 meters, and has actually been test-produced.</p>
<p>These two prototypes are heat-insulated triodes and screen grid tetrodes. The spacing between the electrodes is actually in units of 1/1000, so the degree of narrowness is really amazing. The characteristics are listed below:</p>
<p>Triode:</p>
<p>Plate voltage ··· 67.5V Negative grid voltage ··· 2V Plate current ·· mA · Plate resistance ··· 95000 Mutual conductance ···· 155uA/V Amplification factor ···· 14.7</p>
<p>Tetrode:</p>
<p>Plate voltage ···· 135V Screen grid voltage ··· 67.5V Plate current ···· 4mA Control grid voltage ···· 0.5V Plate resistance ···· 360.0000 Mutual conductance ··· 1100uA/V· Amplification factor ···· 40</p>
<h3 id="e281">A Very Good Two-Tube Radio Circuit <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yuxian</p>
<p>When we design radios, if we want to save a few vacuum tubes, we mostly tend to use regenerative circuits. However, although regenerative circuits perform well, many difficulties often occur in manufacturing and arrangement, often without good results. In the circuit below, detection is handled by a crystal detector, and its output (crystal output) is amplified by the control grid of the first vacuum tube, and then fed back into the detection circuit through the coupling of the screen grid coil; at the same time, their screen grids are also used for the first stage of low-frequency amplification. In form, it seems to be a regenerative circuit, but there should be no difficulty in manufacturing, and there is only one capacitor and moving coil on the panel, and the control is not complicated.</p>
<p>Coil L is the primary, and it is connected to L1 to increase sensitivity. L2 is the feedback coil, all wound on a spiderweb board. The primary is about ten turns (those using short antennas need to increase it), and the secondary is sixty or seventy turns, which must be determined by experimentation. If necessary, a tap can be added at point X for matching. Forty turns are enough for regeneration. The crystal can be fixed or movable. The resistance values of resistors R5 and R3 must be very accurate, otherwise it is easy to cause distortion. When using 135 volts for the B battery, a loudspeaker can be used. The bypass capacitor C6 must not be omitted. The remaining values are noted in the diagram, so I will not repeat them.</p>

<h3 id="e282">Continued Discussion of Compound Vacuum Tubes <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Si Lian</p>
<p>In addition to what Ban Jie Jun described, there are also compound vacuum tubes such as 29I, 293, 295-19, 53, 79, 85, and the new vacuum tubes 6F7-2A7, etc. Furthermore, vacuum tubes such as 2A757, 6A7, and IA6 can also perform two functions. These compound vacuum tubes are mostly two tubes combined, taking advantage of their space-saving nature and resistance to distortion, taking the same plate voltage, and the output can obtain twice or more of the audio power. As shown in</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the simplest compound vacuum tube, which contains two triodes, PG is the input triode, and PIGr is the output triode. The filament is shared. This tube can be used as a single-tube machine, with the input section used for detection and the output used for low-frequency amplification. The effectiveness is the same as two triodes. 29r, 293, 295, etc. have already been recorded in this magazine. 53, 79, etc. have more</p>
<h3 id="e283">Figure 2 <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>One cathode · 85 is the same as 55. Figure 2 shows the new vacuum tube 6F7. This is a vacuum tube for automobiles. The filament voltage is six and three tenths volts · three amps. It is a combined pentode and triode tube. In this type of vacuum tube, use 5 KP GG for powerful detection, and the sensitivity and selectivity are excellent. If the coil is regenerative, the effectiveness will be even better. Then use P G as a stage of low-frequency amplification, so the single-tube machine makes the speaker extremely loud.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Figure 3 <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Figure 3 is the latest type of vacuum tube · Green voltage is twelve point six volts, and the tube is also divided into two parts · One is the rectifier section, and one is the pentode audio frequency powerful amplification section · PKGS · G is the pentode amplification tube, P K is the rectifier section power supply one hundred and ten volts AC or DC can be used.</p>
<p>Because it can save space and at the same time the effectiveness is not bad, Americans often like to use it in radios. This radio is already sold in this port's Fuxing Electrical Materials Store. The machine is two tubes, namely 6F7 and -2A7 two tubes. The box is extremely small, weighs about two pounds, and can be placed in a pocket, so it is also called a pocket radio. The sound is also extremely loud. Receiving this port and the Central government does not require an antenna, because this actually has the effectiveness of a five-tube machine. The circuit will be described later. Figure 4 2A7 was originally a heptode and can now perform two functions. Use the tetrode PGGK as the input section, and use the inner grid and anode grid as a stage of amplification. Tube 57 is slightly different, using the shielding grid as the plate of the output section, and the screen grid as the output grid. Its effectiveness should also be slightly smaller than 27A.</p>

<p>Dr. Philips (Dr. A. F. Philips) is the president of Philips Radio Company. His contribution to radio is truly great. This year, March 17th was the grand celebration of the doctor's sixtieth birthday and the fortieth anniversary of his service to Philips Company. On the day of the celebration, the Queen of the Netherlands bestowed upon the doctor the badge of Senior Lord, and the King of Belgium also conferred the title of Lord upon the doctor on the same day.</p>
<p>On the day of the celebration, more than 20,000 men and women gathered to congratulate him. The two attached pictures were taken from the doctor's celebration ceremony. The one sitting in the special viewing seat in the picture is the Dr. Philips and his wife, who are admired by thousands of people. The grandeur of the ceremony can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e286">The Past and Present of Vacuum Tubes (Continued) <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Manuscript from Philips Company</p>
<p>(2) Early Development: The specialized technology of radio vacuum tubes has progressed extremely rapidly. The reason for this should be attributed to the enthusiastic research of amateur home enthusiasts in various countries and the expansion of the army and navy. Moreover, the need for good quality and inexpensive radios by the public has promoted the development of specialized technology, and the manufacturing of vacuum tubes has become increasingly perfect.</p>
<p>At the same time, the D-series tubes produced by Philips are undoubtedly a great achievement. Although their reception is weaker, it does not matter. On the one hand, the extremely heavy B battery has been reduced as much as possible due to the emergence of low-vacuum tubes and dual-grid tubes. The only fly in the ointment is that each tube still requires a large current of 0.5 amps. If a four-tube machine is turned on for five hours a day, the large-capacity battery will be exhausted within a few days, which is not economical.</p>
<p>Therefore, micro-heat tubes came into being to meet the needs of the times. Almost all the tungsten filaments used in old-fashioned vacuum tubes were eliminated and replaced with barium oxide-coated filaments. Because barium oxide can emit a larger amount of electrons at low temperatures, the current consumed in this new type of vacuum tube is extremely small, about one percent of the current consumed in old-fashioned vacuum tubes. The manufacture of micro-heat tubes began in 1923 (AI06 and A306). A few years later, high-voltage vacuum tubes began to appear on the market to compete with low-voltage tubes, prompting scientists to focus on the design of special vacuum tubes (to be continued).</p>
<h3 id="e287">Recent Radio Miracles <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>Among the various scientific inventions in the twentieth century, radio is probably the most amazing, right? Imagine, day and night, countless radio stations emit radio waves that intersect and pass through our bodies, but we don't feel anything. Music, speech, SOS signals for help, alarms, etc. constantly invade your body within 24 hours a day. Isn't this amazing enough? If you use a very sensitive radio, you can feel all these thousands of radio waves of all shapes and sizes all over the world. As for the radio waves themselves, unless we are experts, we don't understand them very well. In fact, radio waves are the same as light waves. For example, the speed of light waves is 186,000 miles per second, and so is the speed of radio waves. However, light waves are what our visual organs can feel, while radio waves require special sensing devices.</p>
<p>Through the continuous research of engineers and scholars in the world, miracles have emerged one after another. When Heinrich Hertz</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>first experimented with the induction coil and the spark gap, the radio waves generated were like a stone thrown into water, creating some water waves that disappeared in an instant. A few years later, when the vacuum tube was invented, the full wave appeared. Later, scientists used it to add another frequency of radio waves (such as audio frequency), and the amplitude modulation effect was successful. This is like a cork floating on a water wave, the water holds the cork, sinking and floating, and spreading far away. Thus, the radio telephone was produced.</p>
<p>Later, American engineers, because there was a disadvantage of not being able to keep secrets in transatlantic radiotelephones, came up with a method called inverted or scrambled speech. The principle of this method cannot be explained in this short article, but roughly speaking, it uses two oscillators to emit two different frequencies at the same time. Therefore, a special device must be used in the radio, otherwise what is received is just some vague sounds.</p>
<p>These are not considered strange! The strangest thing is that, according to recent news from Europe, someone has already invented a method that can broadcast two different programs from the same radio station, using the same frequency, at the same time, and can be mixed some. At the same time, engineers at Columbia Broadcasting Station in the United States have also successfully experimented with broadcasting television and speech simultaneously using one frequency. However, the radio must also have a special device. The principle is that two different programs use a local oscillator in the transmitter to make it work intermittently. In other words, it is using a paralyzing grid bias to connect two different low-frequency amplifiers to the same amplitude modulator. Since this amazing discovery, the opportunity for radio stations to broadcast can be doubled. However, can it only be doubled? I'm afraid it's not just that in the future. In wired telegraphy, isn't there a method called multiplex telegraphy? It can send as many as eight telegrams at the same time. So, in radio, if you continue to work hard, in the future, let alone eight, I'm afraid a dozen telegrams can be broadcast simultaneously under the same</p>
<p>frequency. The current smoky broadcasting situation in Shanghai may also get a solution from this!</p>
<h3 id="e288">A Radio with a Loudspeaker Using Only One Vacuum Tube <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>This radio uses only one vacuum tube and can play a loudspeaker, and the sound it produces is not to be called weak. Stable reception and simple adjustment are its characteristics. There is no difficulty in manufacturing and using it. If you pay a little attention when manufacturing it, it will definitely not fail.</p>
<p>The circuit output by this radio is the Flewelling super regenerative type, which uses a single No. 33 pentode strong amplification vacuum tube for detection. Its circuit is as shown in the attached diagram, and the component values are as follows:</p>
<p>C1 0.0005 variable capacitor. C2 C5 0.00025 Farad mica fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>C3 C4 0.0006 Farad mica fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>RI 1 million ohm grid leak resistor. RI 15 ohm variable resistance resistor. WI WI is wound on a one-inch diameter circular tube. WI is 110 turns of 32-gauge enameled wire, and W2 is 45 turns of 36-gauge double-silk wrapped wire.</p>
<p>Vacuum tube No. 33. (No. 83 and No. 47 can also be used)</p>
<p>A battery, 2 volts. B battery, 90 to 135 volts.</p>
<p>If it is not working after it is made, you can try switching the two-wire ends of W2. This machine does not need a ground wire. If you want to use a ground wire, connect it as shown by the dotted line in the diagram. Adding a fixed capacitor of 0.0001 Farad at the wiring nail of the loudspeaker can sometimes improve performance, you can try it. (The connection method is as shown by the dotted line in the diagram)</p>
<p>The fixed capacitors in this machine must be of the values specified, and they must all use mica insulation, so as not to reduce the regenerative power. The loudspeaker used should use a higher impedance, then the performance will be better. An antenna of 75 feet is sufficient, any longer than this may reduce</p>
<p>performance.</p>
<h3 id="e289">B-Class Detection Experiment <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yuxian</p>
<p>We all know that the output of Class B amplification is extremely strong, so it is very suitable for use in the final amplification stage. As for using it in the detection stage, it is still rare. The reason is that most ordinary radios that need very high sound waves tend to think about the low-frequency amplification section; and it is also very difficult to use two vacuum tubes in practice, but now that dual tubes have appeared, you might as well try it. Below is a standard circuit for Class B detection. The figure has a regenerative effect, so its effectiveness is no less than that of ordinary two or three-stage high-frequency amplification, and it can also be modified into a small-power transmitter. The manufacturing is also not very difficult.</p>
<p>Coil L is the primary, the number of turns is the same as ordinary ones, and each upper and lower part of LI2 is about one-half of the ordinary screen grid coil. For example: if the entire LI is seventy turns, then LIA is thirty-five turns, and LIB is also thirty-five turns, but its exact number of turns must be determined by experiment. GL is the grid leak. When the vacuum tube V uses dry electricity, ro can be used, and AC can use -53 and 2B6. Those who are interested in research should try it.</p>

<p>The reputation of Stewart radios There are many types of radios on the market, and Stewart is also one of the leading radios. It has special achievements in receiving stations in other locations, and the price is also very low. The general manager for China is American Radio Company, No. 82 Nanjing Road. The company has three retail stores, one at No. 362 Nanjing Road, which is currently being renovated and is open as usual, and will be completed soon, one at No. 162 Hubei Road, and one at No. 386 Gongguan Road. Each store has specialist technicians to guide users on everything about the selection, use, and protection methods of radios in great detail. The company also carries Sullivan vacuum tubes, which are highly trusted by users. Each time they arrive, they sell out without advertising. The new goods are coming to Shanghai soon. Those whose reception is not very clear during the rainy season can install this tube, and they will definitely be satisfied.</p>

<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>(4) Impromptu Scene</p>
<p>The weather is getting warmer day by day, and the willow leaves in the yard are hanging like silk threads. The morning sun shines on the paper windows, making them feel warm.</p>
<p>Because I have to go out for a walk every day, I get up around six o'clock. This is not considered very early in the countryside. The earliest ones should be the sparrows in the eaves, whose chirping can be heard as soon as dawn breaks. Birds have an urgent need for light, and because their perches and flight paths are high, they have the quickest sense of light. Next are beasts, and humans are the slowest. This is because some people know how to take advantage of the darkness, while others succumb to it. As darkness becomes a habit for humans, the sense of light becomes duller day by day.</p>
<p>But among humans, there are differences. Poor people sense light faster than rich people, and rural areas faster than cities. This place is both rural and full of poor people, so as soon as the birds and animals chirp, people start moving in the breaking dawn. My daily destination is along the road north of the village. From that place, you can see the red glow as the sun rises in the east, and the chimneys of the farmers' houses curling around the elm trees behind the village. The air is filled with fragrance, and there are patches of purple alfalfa, tender green buds holding dew, and yellow rapeseed flowers.</p>
<p>In the gardens planted with cabbage and clover, groups of three or five young village girls squat there picking flowers. They plan to take them to the town to sell, which can bring in a good amount of money each year. Planting grain, planting wheat, planting every drop of the farmers' sweat, and bringing them to the city results in surprisingly low prices, and no one ever praises them. But if they bring flowers to the town, the ladies will say they are beautiful and fresh, and maybe they will even give a few extra coins when they are in a good mood.</p>
<p>Country people understand this situation very well, so the number of people growing flowers is increasing year by year, adding a lot of beautiful scenery to the countryside. This scenery also reveals a tragic fate.</p>
<p>The road north of the village is endless. I know how to stop my steps and stand watching the farmers working in the fields. They are busy loosening the soil, busy removing weeds. Their work is intense, and I really don't believe I have a reason to stand idly by.</p>
<p>Ladies, misses, masters, and young masters know how to enjoy those flowers, grains, wheat, and all kinds of novelties and foreign goods that country people can't even imagine. Luxury, debauchery, leisure, and enjoyment encompass their entire lives.</p>
<p>However, there is no reason for anyone to stand idly by.</p>

<p>— Anahan</p>
<p>Material things are finite, but the spirit is infinite. -- No matter who it is, the mention of Gandhi always inspires some reverence.</p>
<p>Indeed, before such a great personality, one cannot help but feel one's own insignificance and smallness. Emerging from death into life, dedicating one's entire soul to the nation, not suffocating oneself in the whirlpool of power, wisdom, deceit, and violence, but compassionately caring for all mankind, planning for their liberation, and envisioning the future: while not only seeing through one's own life and death, but also seeing through history, seeing through the world, and seeing through material things -- has there ever been such a great figure in the history of the East and West? This is why he is Maharama, Mahatma!</p>
<p>But Mahatma does not want people to honor him as Mahatma. He considers himself humble, believing that the great one is a heavenly god, God. A few years ago, when leading his followers to the seashore to collect salt, some followers walked in front carrying fire bowls. When Gandhi found out, he gave a long speech, believing that this was a humiliation for their followers, and he vowed: if our followers harass the people and receive offerings from them, it is no different from looting the people. Moreover, if that is the case, after we die, dogs will lick our bones!</p>
<p>Often rising before dawn, guided by the stars, to spin and weave, writing in his diary under the moonlight, giving speeches during the day, and handling affairs, all for the sake of saving the Indian nation and resisting the Europeans, yet strong, brave, and peaceful!</p>
<p>However, recently after being released from prison, he was attacked by thugs. Although he was not hit, several attendants were injured. What is the motive of these thugs who act as pawns for foreigners? It's like sitting on a tree branch and chopping down the trunk with an axe! But tens of millions of Gandhians will become angry and destroy everything. The British have always protected Gandhi, not because they didn't want to get rid of him, but because they feared something. But this is not the true heart of the Mahatma, who instead said: if my followers have done something wrong, I will repent!</p>
<p>Alas! This is the compassion of the world's greatest personality. Because of peace, he is broad-minded; because he seeks the liberation of mankind, he stands tall like a bright star in the sky, understood and worshipped by people all over the world. -- With this, one can measure the size and height of popular leaders of the past and present!</p>

<p>— Translated by Ling Yang from Bａrｄ—ｌａｉｒｅ</p>
<p>My youth was just a dark storm, with only a few rays of brilliant sunlight shining through from time to time. The few remaining crimson fruits in my garden, devastated by thunder and rain.</p>
<p>·······················</p>
<p>Now my heart has reached autumn,</p>
<p>I am waiting to use iron shovels and hoes to renovate the land that has been eroded into a tomb-like shape by floods.················· Who knows, can the flowers I dream of find the nourishment they need to grow in this sandy soil?············· Ah, misfortune! Ah, misfortune! Time devours life, and the enemies that erode our hearts and suck our blood are growing stronger and stronger.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Lujiang Dam <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>On the journey in western Yunnan, the most poisonous miasma place is probably Lujiang Dam. According to common lore, to pass through there, one must get up early in the morning, put a grass cigarette in the mouth, and quickly walk through. At other times, the miasma comes out. If you don’t know and venture out, and smell a sweet aroma like glutinous rice, that is extremely dangerous. When Yang Sheng'an was banished to Yongchang, he wrote a poem "The Precious Well," which included lines such as "Lujiang's eight bends have much miasma," and "The silent miasma has no cure." This shows that the frightening nature of Lujiang has been known since ancient times. However, this is only limited to the summer and autumn seasons. Winter and spring are not so serious. When I arrived there, luckily it was February, so I didn't have to choose a time or hold a cigarette in my mouth. I even stayed by the river for a night.</p>
<p>Lujiang Dam is a long and narrow plain along the Lujiang River (also known as the Nujiang River), flanked by high and steep peaks. The outside wind is very difficult to blow in, so it is very hot all year round. The cogon grass growing in the dam is stronger than elsewhere, which is probably proof of the toxic climate. There is an iron chain bridge on the river, connecting merchants between Yongchang and Tengyue. During the day, people and horses passing by may make it lively, but at night it lies there lonely, the river rushing and roaring below, rushing towards the mountain canyons to the south. On the plaque at the bridgehead, illuminated by the moonlight, the large characters "Lushui" were visible, along with a line of small script by Li Genyuan.</p>
<p>"Could the Lushui river where 'in the fifth month, crossing the Lu, going deep into barren lands' be this river?"</p>
<p>Harboring gloomy doubts, dragging my tired legs, I quickly stepped into the lit house under the bridge. But the men and women in the house who greeted me with surprised eyes were not like our Han people. The women wore short clothes that reached their abdomen and long skirts that reached their ankles, all in black. When they spoke, they revealed their black teeth, but their faces were beautiful. Their heads were wrapped in black silk, piled up to about a foot high, as if they were wearing a small bucket. As soon as I saw it, I couldn't help but think of the local ghosts in the City God Temple in my hometown. Moreover, the wind that sneaked in through the bamboo wall cracks blew the lights flickering from time to time, combined with their shadows running around the house barefoot, always made people feel a little scared. We had dinner at the same table with them. The rice was all cold, and the soup made of fern leaves and wild mushrooms, as well as the fried dried bamboo shoots, were only lukewarm. (The reason is that they don't like hot food, which is due to the hot weather). If you regard this night's experience as being in the underworld, it may be more appropriate. This was the first time I met the Baiyi people in western Yunnan.</p>
<p>Of the things brought to China by Westerners, the most common and deeply rooted in the interior is probably opium, which is second to none. The Baiyi people here have also long accepted this gift. When the hostess led me into another room to rest, a Baiyi teenager lying on a bamboo bed smoking a pipe slightly raised his head and greeted me, and looking at his delicate face, only fifteen or sixteen years old, made me feel a little gloomy.</p>
<p>"Tonight an old Han Chinese came to our old Baiyi's house!"</p>
<p>I heard the woman laughing in the next room, speaking stiff Yunnan dialect in a low voice, and also specially added two unnecessary "old" words. I smiled slightly as I took off my clothes, and I felt in my heart:</p>
<p>"This is a peaceful and kind nation!"</p>

<p>— Shu</p>
<p>This collection of letters is different from ordinary selections. The main feature is that it preserves many Ming Dynasty letters that have been lost or are now rarely seen. Second, it is not like Wang Shizhen's "Pure Selections of Letters," where the Ming Dynasty only occupies one volume, only one-sixteenth of the whole; nor is it like books such as "Ming Sages' Remaining Letters," which only select large articles discussing morality, making people's heads ache, but only some casual, very rhythmic lyrical essays, which are easiest to see the author's real life and true feelings. Third, although the selected letters focus on the Ming Dynasty, there are many from the late Ming Dynasty, especially those from the Gong'an School, which can be said to be very important documents for those who study this school of literature. In my subjective view, this book, compiled by Ming people, and Mei Gong's "Paired Fish Letters" can be called twin jewels.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Among the Ming people, Wang Shizhen, Li Yu-lin, Chi Shui, Chen Mei-gong, and the three Yuan brothers collected the most letters, followed by Xu Wenchang, Zong Zixiang, and Lu Shen. Wang, Li, Xu, Zong, and Lu aside, Chi Shui's letters, although similar to his other writings, are not lacking in the disgusting atmosphere of parallel prose, but there are quite a few good ones. He said to Wang Baigu, "I am poor to the bone, and I don't want to frown at the butchers and wine sellers, so I open my mouth and laugh every day with joy. If I have a little money at home, I sit idly with relatives and friends for pure joy. When the mood strikes, I sing Xingqu, with young boys blowing pipes and playing Sheng beside me, which is very pleasant. The jars are empty, and the kitchen has no breakfast, but my spirit is still clear and bright. To end this life in this way is not bad." In a short passage, one can imagine his life and free and easy demeanor. Like other letters describing mountain life, he said, "Being in the present, I never calculate tomorrow's food, clothing, marriage, or household matters." As for Chen Mei-gong, the most letters in this collection are his. Difficult to abridge, some are no longer letters, but most are lovely chapters. I especially like to read his letter to Wang Yuanmei: "Since we parted, I have spent the spring in reading, not knowing that there are wine cups and flowers outside the door. I often remember the Qiyuan Temple, the green grass and singing birds; recently following your footsteps, laughing and talking in harmony. Such a beautiful scene has suddenly fallen into a dream!" And to Wu Dacheng, he said, "I spent more than two months avoiding the heat in Dongting Lake, with tall pines blocking the sun and flying waterfalls like snow. I eat dozens of loquats and bayberries every day. I regret that I cannot share them with you." Sending to a friend, he said: "From spring to summer in a Gengshen year, the old rain does not stop. The scenery in the mountains changes in a hundred ways, which is really enjoyable for the elderly. I often think of the Nan Guan father and son, still living in a painted world, not as good as our family's windy and rainy days, all of which are my painted forests. I should show it to Xuanzai and ask him to title it 'Talking about Rain.'" Written casually, in a few words, it really makes people linger. However, this is not the world we live in today.</p>
<h3 id="e296">Mud <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Cangcen</p>
<p>In the twilight of a rainy summer day, I walked through a muddy path. Lush willow groves shaded both sides of the road, and passionate songs came from the grove.</p>
<p>I know that this is the singing of the orioles --</p>
<p>Fiery passion floating in the air!</p>
<p>Ah, my heart is also full of boundless passion. I want to turn it into a lingering new song; in the depths of silence, hide myself and pour out the same song as you! But alas, time does not allow me to stop for a moment, I must pass through the mud in front of me.</p>

<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>Inside the door: The blue gas lamp laughed hissingly. Millions of rays of light fell like rapid rain on the walls, tables, ground, and people. Further in, there was a high counter, like a pawnshop or a bank. The counter was surrounded by copper railings, on which were pasted many colorful paper slogans. On the left wall of the entrance hung two blackboards, on which were written in white powder the winning numbers from the previous draw. Many people wearing wooden clogs, armed belts, glasses, and slicked hair were constantly squeezing in and out of the shop's entrance.</p>
<p>Afa wanted to step in, but his legs just twisted to the side and then straightened out again, going back to the road he had come from. "So many people are buying, how can I win? It's harder than finding a needle in the sea! Hard! Hard! Hard! Don't be fooled!" His mouth was reluctantly arguing with his uncooperative feet.</p>
<p>Afa really didn't want to buy! If that's what he said, Afa's heart would protest. He really wanted to, but he couldn't help but feel a little flustered. He understood that it was his first time taking a train, his first time running into a big tea house, and he inevitably felt unnatural and flustered about every strange and novel thing.</p>
<p>It was really strange that in the rice fields in June and July, which were so hot that even the leeches were hot, his feet had never been as afraid to step into this shop as they were here.</p>
<p>"Be brave! This isn't stealing, what's there to be afraid of? Maybe there aren't any acquaintances there! So many people are pouring in and out, you can't recognize them all, and even if you do, what's there to be afraid of? It's not like I'm breaking the law. Besides, who doesn't love money? Who doesn't covet windfall riches? ········"</p>
<p>The louder the voice in his heart shouted, the faster his steps moved forward.</p>
<p>"Top-quality Luogang Dong glutinous rice lychees! ··· Two cents a catty." He had already reached the corner of Kuai Fu Street. He subconsciously took out a few copper coins and bought a few, peeling and eating them while turning back.</p>
<p>With lychees to peel and eat in his hand, others wouldn't suspect that he was intent on buying Shanpu lottery tickets. His courage had increased a lot. He lingered at the entrance for a while. He had to take a closer look at the shop.</p>
<p>At the door was a long red cloth banner with melon-sized gold characters: "Two cents can get you more than 40,000 yuan!" His heart shrank, and his blood stopped. Then it started to race and jump wildly. More than 40,000 yuan? He had only vaguely known before that winning the first prize could bring a lot of money, but he had never expected such a great joy. His feet stepped forward again. Ah, ah, no wonder they want to buy, ··· they are not stupid! Spending two cents to get more than 40,000 yuan, who says it's not worth it? Ah, ah, a thousand yuan is worth it, ten thousand yuan is worth it! ··· He walked to the fifth perfume shop and then turned back.</p>
<p>Let's go back and see what else is written in the shop.</p>
<p>A red piece of paper on the copper railing was blown by the wind:</p>
<p>"Hit it with a lucky hand!" His heart shook again, and his feet wanted to move forward again. No, wait a moment, let's see what a few more say. The second one, in yellow: "Buy it and win!" The third one, in blue: "Open the road to windfall riches!" The fourth one, in purple: "··········"</p>

<h3 id="e298">Financial: Silver Prices Rise; Speculation Fund Drops Ten Dollars and Five Cents; Thomas Amendment Postponement Keeps Market Stable; Cantonese Banks Liquidate, Breaking the Forty-Dollar Barrier <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a rebound in silver prices. News of the recovery, which had been telegraphed and published the day before, had a wearying effect on foreign exchange sentiment. A wave of selling ensued, with Cantonese speculators liquidating their positions, leading to a volatile market that briefly broke through the forty-dollar barrier. Initially, overseas silver markets showed gains, with both British and American markets rising. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by varying degrees, from 3.5% to 6.6%. Exchange rates also increased. London raw gold fell by 3.5 pence, American cotton fell by 8 points, and American wheat fell by .625. The market opened sharply lower. Later, it breached the fifty-dollar barrier. However, a Reuters report stating that the Grace Amendment proposed by Senator Thomas, originally scheduled for discussion at a meeting between silver advocates and the President on Saturday afternoon, had been postponed to the following Monday, led to a rally that pushed prices back above the fifty-dollar mark. Subsequent Reuters dispatches were inconsequential. The HSBC Bank exerted significant effort to control both British and American exchange rates, stabilizing the silver market. With no high expectations, large investors began selling off positions, pushing prices below the fifty-dollar mark again. Later, the internal market softened, with arbitrage traders actively selling, and Cantonese banks such as Shengda and Hengxing also cutting their long positions. With banks tightening their lending policies, the gold market weakened further, dropping below the forty-dollar mark again. At noon, the market slightly stabilized as the Central Bank intervened with cash. The subsequent market performance was lackluster. In the Seattle night market, silver prices rose, experiencing a brief period of high-to-low volatility. Similar arbitrage transactions were not as active, leading to some market tightening and continued price increases internally. However, with Cantonese banks resuming sales, there was continued struggle. Ultimately, market sentiment stabilized as large investors bought in and old news resurfaced, such as the silver meeting being postponed to the following Monday. The market closed relatively stable. The Western merchants' spring races would close the market for three afternoons, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The price of pure gold was calculated at 1,066 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The market opened at 1,054 yuan, down 3.2 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at the same price. The foreign exchange market opened with recent selling prices: British exchange at 1 shilling and 3 pence, and American exchange at 31.875 yuan. Huixiang, Yuanchangyong, Hengyu, and Zhengchang successively sold, gradually retreating from 5.5 yuan. Huabi sold July American dollars at .9375, falling to 48 yuan. The Reuters report on the Thomas Amendment postponement to the following Monday prompted Dingkang, Shunmao, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, and others to buy, pushing the price back up to 54.5 yuan. Yuanchangyong continued to sell, lowering the price to 1.5 yuan. Despite this, market sentiment remained steady, and Dadecheng, Hengxingyuan, Yuanshengyong, and others continued to buy strongly, pushing the price up to 6.5 yuan. Dadecheng and Yuanmao sold off, hardening the exchange rate and causing it to fall. When Zhejiang sold July American dollars at 32 yuan, Tianfeng, Yuanheng, Zhaofengchang, and Yongfeng jointly sold, causing the price to fall to 47.5 yuan. Anticipating HSBC's listing of British rising 5 and American rising .625, they were not satisfied. Yuqingyong and Fuxingyong bought at low prices, pushing the price back up to over 50 yuan. Zhaofengchang, Fuchang, Dafayong, Hongli, Yuanchun, Yifengyong (representing Qianchangxiang), and others successively sold off, gradually declining and once falling to 44.5 yuan. Huabi HSBC offered September American dollars at .375. Tianfeng, Hengxing, Fuchang, Yuanshengyong, Hengtai, Fuan, and others made some purchases at low prices. Although Fuxingyong and Chunyuan yong sold, they were still able to rise back to 9 yuan, while Hengxing, Dadecheng, Hengyu, and Qianchangxiang came to sell. The foreign exchange market was firm, with a lack of buyers, and in the blink of an eye, it fell to 2.5 yuan. Hengxing came out to buy, pushing it up to 6 yuan again. After entering, HSBC sold a significant amount of shillings and US dollars, and the market could not sustain it. Cantonese Hengxing vigorously sold, and Hengxingyuan also sold off. Qianchangxiang, Yuanheng, and Yuanmaoyong all sold, causing the price to fall to 39 yuan. Hengtai and Yuanshengyong continued to buy, raising it to 50 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengxing, Zhifengyong, and Hengxingyuan continued to sell, and Shanghai sold August US dollars at .5625, falling to 37 yuan. Yuanshengyong continued to buy, and although it added to 9 yuan and 8 jiao, Yifengyong's selling caused sentiment to become weak again, and it fell further to 6.5 yuan. Upon hearing the news of the Central Bank opening cash, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuanshengyong, and others jointly bought, gradually rising back to 43 yuan. The foreign exchange market was still strong, and Shengda and Hengxing sold again, causing it to fall to 38 yuan and 2 jiao. Cuitai, Ruikang, and Qianchangxiang successively accepted, and the noon close rose again to 1,041 yuan and 8 jiao. Goods were auctioned at 1 yuan, and the price declined slightly after the close.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1,040 yuan and 8 jiao, and goods opened at 1 yuan. Sentiment stabilized and rose. However, because the internal market was quiet and there was much fluctuation, Yuanchun, Bingxing, Huixiang, and Yuanmaoyong accepted, rising 4 yuan and 9 jiao. HSBC offered May American dollars at .0625. Dadecheng and Qianchangxiang sold, falling to within 3 yuan. Then, upon hearing that the night market silver price rose .75, it fell to .05 yuan. However, because sentiment was still stable, buyers were also active. Upon hearing that speculator Wu was accepting, the internal market also tightened. Colleagues were still relying on Hengyu, Qingfayong, and others accepted, and August American dollars at .4375 were difficult to settle, and rose to around 5 yuan. After entering, Cantonese banks came to cut their long positions again. Yuqingyong and Yuanmaoyong in the market sold vigorously. However, because the internal market tightened, the market situation stabilized. Huabi ate August shillings at .1875. Although there was a decline, it was still able to rise back to over 5 yuan. Afterwards, Fuyu and Bingxing sold. Mitsui sold August American dollars at .375, falling to 2 yuan and 6 jiao. Hengxing and Changshengyong bought, and it rose to around 4 yuan again. Fuchang and Chunyuan yong also bought, and it rose to 5 yuan. After entering, Cantonese banks came to sell vigorously again, and it still retreated to 3 yuan. Qingfayong, Fuxingyong, Dalian Gang, and others successively bought. Zhengjin ate August American dollars at .4375. The internal market was still good, and buyers in the market suddenly became courageous. Before the close, it was actually driven up to 7 yuan, which was an old matter of rementioning the telegraph of the silver meeting being postponed to Monday. The close was 1,046 yuan and 7 jiao, and goods were auctioned at 6 yuan. After the close, the market was stable. Fuchang and others entered to 7 yuan. Yuanmaoyong came to sell and retreated slightly. Upon investigation, the highest price of the day was 1,056 yuan and 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 1,036 yuan and 5 jiao, with a fluctuation of 20 yuan. As a result, it fell 10 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 31.5 yuan due to HSBC's American exchange listing rising .625, with a combined premium price of 1,098 yuan and a fraction. According to the closing price, it was about 52 yuan, less 11 yuan than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 1,044 yuan, and for June it was 1,042 yuan. The morning supplement was 1,044 yuan, and the afternoon supplement was 1,049 yuan. The pure gold price was 1,066 yuan, and the market conditions for raw gold were clear. Tianjin Gang Zi Heng 1,400 taels, calculated at an additional 14 yuan and 2 jiao. After entering, the gold price was slightly higher downstream, but it was difficult to sell at 14 yuan and 5 jiao. Yingfengheng sold 500 taels to Ke Gang, calculated at an additional 14 yuan and 5 jiao. The public orders released yesterday included 217 strips from Yingfengheng, 181 strips from Tongfengheng, 105 strips from Dadecheng, and 7 strips from Yongfeng. The strips received included 252 strips from Qianchangxiang, 245 strips from Yuanyi, and 28 strips from Changshengyong. The Central Bank opened a significant amount of cash, presumably because colleagues had too much physical inventory and had to work hard to release it. The price was calculated at 1,040 yuan. As of today, 43 strips from May were still left, for a total of three long positions and eight short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still active. In summary, Shengda, Hengxing, Senchangyong, Qianchangxiang, Zhengchang, Dingkang, Hengxingyuan, Runchangyu, Yicheng, Chengkangyong, Dachangxiang, Fuan, Yuanyi, Yuanmaoyongde, Futaiheng, Yongfeng, etc., were on the selling side. Wanxing, Yuanshengyong, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Huiyuan, Huixiang, Tongfu, Shunmao, Tongchun, Yingfengheng, Tongfengheng, Cuitai, Yuanheng, Yong, Fuyu, etc., were on the buying side. Yuqingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanchun, Bingxing, and Fuxingyong first entered and then exited. Hengyu, Qingfayong, and Yifengyong first exited and then entered. Dalian Gang smoothly did a total of 3,100, with a slight squeeze. Wanxing did a total of less than 2,700, squeezing in a little over 1,000. Cantonese Shengda sold a total of 1,700 or 1,800 strips. Hengxing also exited 700-plus strips in the afternoon, exiting 1,800-plus strips. As of today, the number of chips for June totaled 27,132 strips, for a total of 47 long positions and 50 short positions. The total number of transactions for the day was 60,536 strips in the morning and 21,819 strips in the afternoon.</p>
<p>HSBC sold a considerable amount</p>
<h3 id="e299">British and American Exchanges Both Strengthen <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, large London bars rose by .0625 recently, while forward bars remained flat. American silver rose by .125, and the forward silver price rose by 3.5%. British currency rose against American currency by one-half, and American currency rose against British currency by .625. British currency rose against French currency by 6 pounds, while American currency remained flat against French currency. London raw gold fell by 3.5 pence, private telegraph silver prices rose by .25, and exchange rates rose by .75. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices: British currency at 1 shilling and 3 pence, and American currency at 31.875 yuan. Compared to the previous close, British currency was looser by .125, and American currency was firmer by .25. After opening, it remained loose. Although the Reuters dispatch had news of the Thomas Supplemental Bill being postponed, and HSBC listed British currency up .25 and American currency up .625, it did not see satisfaction. However, banks still lacked much buying appetite. HSBC worked hard to supply a considerable amount of shillings and US dollars, and the process gradually strengthened. The subsequent market performance was quiet. After entering, although the Seattle night market silver price rose, Chinese merchants actively sought arbitrage transactions, and the process tightened. Finally, although there was fluctuation, the trend ultimately tightened. The closing selling prices for recent British currency was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and .9375, and American currency was 31.9375 yuan.

<p>The financial market situation in recent days has seen a sudden silence since the end of last month due to the long-term streamlining of relationships. All kinds of transactions have entered a state of sleep. In addition, the Ke Gang side is bound by the situation and has reduced the scope, step by step, unable to make speculative dumping behavior, making it even more hopeless for the financial industry to recover. In yesterday's market, the foreign exchange dismantling for both morning and afternoon markets was still 8%, the same as the previous day, with a margin of 4%. The number of bank receipts and payments was not large. Foreign banks received and paid over 1.6 million in bills, settled over 700,000 in foreign exchange, and received and paid over 4.2 million in various cargo exchange guarantee miscellaneous payments. 500,000 entered the warehouse. Chinese banks received and paid over 2.6 million in bills, received and paid over 4 million in various cargo exchange guarantee miscellaneous payments. Over 600,000 in customs revenue. 800,000 came out of the warehouse.

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small ocean opened in the morning market at 844 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon market, it decreased again by 2 yuan to 842 yuan. As a result, it decreased by 3 yuan from the previous day. The Jiang corner is not very widely used. Recently, silk factories have no need, so the continuous decline in recent days or still retreating to within 40 is inevitable. Transaction volume was 4,500 jiao in the morning market and 6,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small ocean opened in the morning market at 743.7 yuan and in the afternoon market at 743.8 yuan. The result was stable, only a slight decrease of 1 jiao from the previous day. Transaction volume was 55,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 500 wen from the previous day, to 330,000 qian, with a transaction volume of 35,970 strings of wen, equivalent to 10,900 foreign dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Securities and Bond Market: More Declines Than Rises. ▲Market Sentiment Weak: Unable to Rebound▲ <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw an initial decline followed by a slight rally and some fluctuation. There were many swap transactions on the market, but the overall sentiment remained weak and unable to rebound. Five and forty-three were mostly sold off, and various groups were not very enthusiastic about buying. However, after the market price fell consecutively, there was a slight rebound. The upward trend may not be sustainable. Large short-sellers not only did not cover but also added more, and the market speculated that they had goods to deliver, so there was some caution. The sudden rise and fall were entirely based on the supply and demand of [coding], with little relation to the current situation. The only impact was that rumors had not subsided, and those who went long had slightly shrunk their positions. In the initial trading session, five and other stocks saw a continued decline, generally falling three or four jiao. The secondary trading session did not improve, and only Jin Duan Zheng Six and Jiu Liu showed a slight recovery of five fen to two jiao. Most other stocks continued to decline by about two or three jiao. In the afternoon opening, eleven, fourteen, twenty, twenty-one, etc., and retail investors covered their short positions. Although five and others still had remaining sales, the supply and demand had diverged. All bond markets collectively rose one to four jiao, a small rally, which was a normal reaction after six consecutive declines. The closing price generally improved by one or two jiao, but it was gradually becoming weak, and the future will likely see more reversals. The market price results showed more declines than rises. Among them, the far-term of Yijiu Guanjin Duan Zheng Liu rose five fen to two and a half jiao, Jiu Liu also rose three jiao, and the remaining stocks continued to fall one to four jiao. The market situation was slightly chaotic. The total transaction volume was approximately 12 to 13 million yuan. The closing was late, so the detailed number is omitted.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday's stock market rose in the morning, as commercial news favored long positions, including the increase in the volume of steel work in the Yang City and the good report of the New York Telephone Company. However, the rise in the market was not active, and speculators threw it out in the end. The number of rises disappeared again. There was not much change from the previous day at closing. Many fell to low points. Small exchanges rose a few corners. Bonds were mixed. US public debt was outstanding. Treasury bonds created seven new highs. According to the agent report, (securities) tend to hover, and the throwing wind has subsided slightly. If there is no bad news, the reaction is imminent. (Wheat) There are scattered showers, and it is predicted that it will continue to rain. However, only heavy rain can relieve it. In terms of the situation, it is beneficial to buy when it falls. (Cotton) The throwing wind has subsided, but buyers are indifferent. There is no follow-up when it rises. The market is mediocre and has no characteristics. Washington predicts that Thomas's new proposal will fail. It is said that the Ministry of Finance purchased silver in spot and near-term, but it has not been confirmed. (Rubber) Several authorities predict that the market price will be much higher, but at high prices, it was discovered that long positions were closing. The market atmosphere was flat due to London's firmness and domestic and brokers buying when it fell. (Sugar) The market situation is firm. Spot has progressed. The sugar case has a situation of being signed soon. The technical position is sound. (Silver) There are continued small purchases of May silver. The market situation is stable, and speculators are waiting for the weekend to develop. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.11 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<p>The yarn market, which has been brewing for many days, has long had the possibility of rising. As Ke Gang's actual sales continue, it is helpless to be oppressed by the sellers, so the market plate presents a state of hovering without advancing. Now, Tianjin Gang has changed to handling Chinese yarn due to the high price of Japanese yarn, followed by the rising price of Japanese yarn, so the short positions are offsetting, and the market price has been stimulated to rise.</p>

<p>Indian cotton has been rising continuously. Japanese merchants are buying spot goods in large quantities. Short positions are also offsetting rapidly. Also, it is brought up by the yarn market. The cotton market, which has been tired for a long time, is now aided by the continuous rise in Indian cotton. Short positions are offsetting. At the same time, Japanese merchants are vigorously purchasing spot cotton, which has greatly improved market sentiment and buying. However, the large short positions are still calm and have no intention of offsetting. Recently, foreign cotton calculations have been higher, and domestic cotton is still difficult to view as small.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was dull and lacked any distinguishing features. Traders adopted a wait-and-see approach, and the spot market was unfavorable. New Orleans cotton was sold off and declined, resulting in no movement in spot prices but a drop of seven or eight points in futures. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose six points, while futures fell two or three points. Egyptian cotton spot prices increased by six points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to speculative buying, resulting in Pingor gaining 3 rupees and 2.5 annas, Omra rising 4 rupees and 7.5 annas, and Broach climbing 5.5 rupees.

<p>"Zhejiang" Local Silkworm Breeds Undergoing Changes: In the four townships of "Haining," farmers raising local breeds account for forty to fifty percent. After hatching, the weather became abnormal, with a lingering spring chill, resulting in uneven ant emergence. The weather turned sunny and warm during the first molt, and development was satisfactory. However, after the second molt and leaf opening, alternating rain and sunshine brought cold weather, reducing the silkworms' resistance. Many experienced loss of sleep and stopped feeding. The development of improved silkworm breeds was also poor. Some failed to molt for the third time, while silkworms in the late second molt, which were consuming large quantities of leaves, also showed slow feeding. Efforts are now being made to isolate them and adjust temperature and humidity to prevent transmission. "Xiaoshan": Among the various towns and villages, the model district in the eastern region has the best silkworm season this year, with eighty to ninety percent raising improved breeds. Due to cold weather and heavy rain, the silkworm season is delayed. In recent days, continuous overcast and rainy weather with cold temperatures has caused silkworms in the early third molt to remain dormant for over thirty hours without seeking food. Everyone is increasing the temperature with stoves.</p>
<p>"Suzhou" Juvenile Silkworm Development Delayed: "Yixing" This year, silkworm farming in areas such as Li Du, Song Du Nan, Fufeng Bridge, Baojia Village, Xushe Qingbaili, etc., is relatively thriving, and many are raising improved breeds. However, due to the cold weather, development is poor. Hatching takes fourteen to fifteen days to begin, and mulberry buds produce leaves late. The early batches are currently in the second molt, while the late batches are opening leaves for six or seven days. Continuous rain has prevailed, and temperatures are low, with instances of sleep loss and cessation of feeding. "Changzhou" This year, fewer silkworm eggs are being raised in the northwest townships. Many are raising local breeds, and egg collection is uneven. Early batches are opening leaves for five or six days in the first molt, while late batches are also trying leaves. Recent rainy and overcast weather, coupled with cold temperatures, has led to many early silkworms suffering from diarrhea and dying after consuming rainwater-soaked leaves. In the eastern townships of Henglin, etc., the development of foreign silkworm breeds is slow due to the cold weather. Early batches are opening leaves for the first molt, while late batches are still just emerging. In the past two days, rain has been a problem, but fortunately, the impact on young silkworms is still minimal. However, the silkworm season is expected to be later than in previous years.</p>
<h3 id="e315">Qimen Black Tea Officially Opens Its Gardens <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>Qimen black tea, which in previous years would have been more than halfway through its harvesting and processing by this time, is experiencing difficulties this year due to the excessively cold weather. Even the tea buds on sun-facing tea trees in the plains have struggled to grow long. Consequently, tea estates that initially planned to start weighing tea on time have temporarily suspended operations. Only the tribute tea green tea from Shanli and Likou, etc., had a small harvest in the previous week, but the output was limited. The purchase price at the tea estates was approximately one yuan and forty-five cents per catty. In the past four or five days, the weather has shown signs of warming, and tea buds are flourishing. However, due to torrential rain day and night, mountain households have been unable to harvest and process the tea. Today (the 29th), the weather suddenly cleared up, and tea farmers in production areas such as Likou, Lunkeng, Taoyuan, Zhukou, Shanli, Gaotang, Penglong, Chentiankeng, Tafang, Pingli, and Guixi, etc., are taking advantage of the sunny weather to spread the tea leaves for drying. They are officially opening their gardens, focusing on tender leaves and discarding old ones to meet this year's standards. Various tea businesses are also sending people to the production areas to procure tea. Weighing is expected to begin in full force tomorrow or the day after. If the weather remains sunny and warm for a week, the first batch of tea produced is expected to be of excellent quality. However, the atmosphere in the production areas has become tense, and tea businesses are anxious. It is unlikely that mountain prices will be lower than in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e316">Ping-Shui Green Tea Gradually Entering the Market <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>Ping-Shui green tea produced in various cities and towns in Zhejiang province has recently begun to be harvested. New products from Zhuji, Xiaoshan, Xinchang, Yuyao, Lin'an, Shangyu, and other places have all entered the market. However, due to the cold weather, tea buds are developing slowly, and output is not particularly abundant. Consequently, various tea businesses are facing a situation of "more monks than porridge" when purchasing tea. The selling price of raw tea is approximately seventy-four to seventy-five yuan for top-quality tea and about sixty-six yuan for lower-quality tea, which is six or seven to ten yuan higher than in previous years.</p>

<p>Yesterday, local tea businesses in Shanghai, such as Tongyifeng, Changji, and Yonglong, transported more than twenty packages of new raw tea from Wenzhou. They are rushing to process it to meet the purchasing needs of foreign tea businesses. It is reported that new products from Shaoxing, Suian, and other routes will also arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3 id="e318">Grain: Late Indica Rice Softens Slightly <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources saw a slight increase only in late indica rice, with seventeen or eighteen shipments arriving, along with more than ten shipments of thick japonica rice and various colored varieties (totaling approximately four thousand dan). After the market situation reversed and became dull on the day before yesterday, the North China trading houses, including those from Tianjin, initially adopted a wait-and-see approach. Although the South China trading houses showed some activity, their buying was extremely strict, requiring price concessions. Sellers with larger inventories had to lower their prices by five cents before the North China trading houses started to buy. By the close of the market, about two thousand packages had been purchased. The market prices for goods from Qingpu, Songjiang, and Sijing had fallen by five cents to nearly a dime. However, the inventory of thick japonica rice remained stable due to scarce arrivals caused by the rain, and shopkeepers remained confident. Demand was weak, but the overall trend was inevitably influenced by the late indica rice. The market situation was no longer as robust as it had been the day before yesterday. Prices for Changzhou, Suzhou, and Nanxun goods rose slightly by three to five cents. Du Yangjian rice remained stable, showing no gains or losses. Yin Yuan rice was scarce, particularly the second batch, and appeared highly sought after.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of boats arriving from He Xia, inland areas, and other locations remained limited, with only thirteen or fourteen shipments. The market for various goods was active due to limited supply and strong demand, but the outlook turned weaker later. Bian Yuan Yangjian rice remained popular. Early thin rice from Yin Yuan has not arrived for three days. Tip rice and Du Tip rice saw some trading. The price of Bai Jing rice rose sharply in the early market due to the previous day's rally, and traders were quoting prices up to a dime higher. However, the market later weakened. The price of Yangjian rice increased by several cents, while prices for Bian Yuan Du Tip rice remained firm. Early thin rice from Yin Yuan was unavailable, and there was no trading.</p>
<h3 id="e319">Starch Market in a Spin <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the starch market remained in a spin on both the upper and lower markets. At the opening of the market in the morning, the price of foreign wheat fluctuated. However, shorts, seeing the authorities' and manufacturers' determination to maintain prices, dared not fail to cover their positions to prevent a future short squeeze. Demand for stockpiling was also good, so prices for all months rose by about one cent at the opening. Subsequently, a major player dumped long positions in the current month, and a manufacturer hedged by receiving near-term and delivering deferred positions, causing the current month to fall immediately. Deferred months initially followed slightly, but after being bought by short hedges and absorbed by outside stockpiling, the market recovered. However, actual sales were sluggish, and inventories of spot starch were high, making a turnaround in the current month difficult. At the close, the price for the current month was down a half-cent, the next month was up 0.75, July/August were up 1 cent, September was up 1.25 cents, and October was up 0.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e320">Wheat Futures Rise as Shorts Cover <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market started strong, buoyed by the previous day's rally. Shorts covered their positions after the opening, and the rainy weather attracted new stockpiling from outside the industry. The market for all months rose sharply, with no one selling in the near term. The opening price for July was as high as 2.73 yuan, up four cents from the previous day's close, and August was at 2.81 yuan, up two cents. However, in the afternoon, merchants and long positions sold, and the market retreated. The closing prices for June, July, and August were the same as the previous day's closing prices, and there were no trades in other months.</p>

<h3 id="e322">Justice and Peace <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>-- Wen Li</p>
<p>"You say you're right, she says she's right" – this applies to individuals. This country says it advocates justice and peace, and that country says it advocates justice and peace – this is from the perspective of the nation. Individuals have different interests, so they argue and fight. Nations have conflicting interests, so they argue and start wars. But when individuals have different interests and hold different reasons, most people understand. But when nations have conflicting interests and advocate justice and peace, most of them keep their people in the dark and use them as cannon fodder. The magic of the slogan of justice and peace is therefore incredible.</p>
<p>According to a report by the Tokyo Telegraph Agency on the 2nd, Foreign Minister Hayashi and Army Minister Araki explained in detail to the Soviet Ambassador to Japan that the Japanese people have no intention of using force at any time. The military preparations Japan needs are within the extent to which the security of the Japanese Empire feels unthreatened. For the sake of justice, Japan is prepared and determined to resist, no matter the sacrifice. It was also emphasized that the world's claim that Army Minister Araki is a warmongering general is entirely due to a lack of understanding. Minister Araki is fundamentally a proponent of peace. – Such statements by proponents of justice and peace, when viewed in light of their years of military aggression in China, are the exact opposite. However, they believe that they are advocating justice and peace, which is worth discussing.</p>
<p>From the perspective of international warfare, when strong countries prepare and wage war to compete for markets, Country A inevitably takes preemptive measures to forcibly seize the territory of neighboring weak nations or countries as preparation to confront Country B, Country C, etc. However, no matter how eloquent you are, this behavior is always ironclad evidence of injustice and a lack of peace for the weak clans and countries whose territory has been seized. Since Japan has already seized our four northeastern provinces, it now declares that it advocates justice and peace. Where is the justice? Peace is even more nonsense. The authorities in our China should protest, but they are attempting to rely on other strong countries to extend justice and are shouting about the "Nine-Power Treaty." It is no wonder that an editorial in a certain newspaper said that China's demise lies in the Japanese minister's declaration that "China must not be interfered with." This is another matter. Just looking at Hayashi Araki's so-called advocacy of "justice" and "peace," his so-called "justice" is from the perspective of the Japanese Empire to maintain their interests, and his so-called "peace" is also to maintain their country's interests in East Asia. The interests mentioned here, are they not the interests of the entire Japanese people? The answer is no. The so-called "national interests," in the view of Japan, are probably the interests of a minority who benefit from competing for overseas markets.</p>
<p>Only a country that is being bullied, oppressed, and invaded is qualified to advocate justice and peace from the perspective of the nation. However, our China doesn't even have the attitude of "you say you're right, she says she's right". Alas, what else can be said?</p>
<h3 id="e323">Spring at Longhua <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>-- Fei</p>
<p>Willows swaying, swallows nesting in pairs; this is the arrival of the charming spring. Peach blossoms smiling on the branches, weeping willows swaying by the river, all the scenery in nature shows a vibrant vitality.</p>
<p>"Spring outing to fragrant meadows, summer enjoyment of green lotus ponds;" this is indeed the joy of life! But we, for the sake of life, for the sake of the environment, have never had the opportunity to enjoy this blessing; let alone a blessing! Even the opportunity to take a trip to vent the coal gas in our chests is impossible. It's embarrassing to say. Since the beginning of spring this year, we have not seen a beautiful sun. It has always been gloomy, depressing weather, which is really annoying. Today, we finally saw a clear day; this is the first clear day this spring. How exciting it is! This day is rare, how can we let it pass lightly?</p>
<p>Li suggested going to New Shanghai, and An said: There's nothing fun in New Shanghai, it's better to go to Longhua. I'm easy, New Shanghai is fine, Longhua is fine too; but, after everyone discussed it, we decided to go to Longhua. The three of us, dragging our heavy steps, stepped onto the long Longhua Road; walking forward while talking and laughing, our hearts filled with many light feelings.</p>
<p>The broad beans and wheat in the fields, the rape flowers, green and yellow, resembled a beautiful natural painting. A fragrance of broad beans mixed with rape seed flowers, directly pounced into our nostrils, and invaded everyone's hearts and spleens. Birds chirping, frogs croaking, all broadcasting their happy songs and rhythmic sounds in nature. We were in it, as if we had entered another world, and almost forgot all the troubles and depression we brought from the city.</p>
<p>Spring light! Beautiful spring light, you intoxicate people; intoxicate them, let them be intoxicated in your embrace!</p>
<p>Nature, lovely nature! You are so enviable!</p>
<p>In front of Longhua Temple, a large crowd of men, women, old and young were crowding; surging like a tide, hugging like bees, continuously pouring into the temple. There were many country women, like country girls, holding incense candles and ingots in their hands, hawking to every tourist and pilgrim.</p>
<p>A series of cars were driving straight into the temple: parked in the open space in front of the hall. From each car, a pair of modern people came out; these were the ancestors of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>In the main hall, red candles were inserted all over the frames, and incense smoke rose into the blue clouds. Those devout men and women were all piously bowing to the Bodhisattva, begging for longevity and blessings. Several monks were busy receiving several decent pilgrims. "Madam", "Grandma", "Master", "Sir", the sounds were broadcast from that lotus-tongued mouth. Li looked at it and couldn't help saying: "Monks are also snobbish!"</p>
<p>"Of course, monks are much more snobbish than laypeople!" An added in agreement.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, just nodded casually. Because, at this time, I was paying attention to another thing --- two young men were teasing three young female students. ---</p>
<p>In the garden to the east, in a corner of the garden, there was a pavilion, with a couple sitting inside telling love stories; face to face, shoulder to shoulder, talking with great relish. In the center of the garden was a teahouse, with a sign hanging that read, "Fragrant Tea, One Dime per Pot". There was also a snack shop, and all kinds of grocery stalls were also available. Back in front of the hall, several country children said to us: "Do you want to see the Great Buddha? We can lead you to see it." We just smiled and didn't answer them. There were many flower sellers standing at the door, selling magnolias, magnolias, canaries, and double-petal peaches, everything. Li wanted to buy a bunch of magnolias, and An wanted to buy a bunch of double-petal peaches; I said, "These flowers are going to wither, what do you want them for?" Later, they finally didn't buy them.</p>
<p>We stepped into the Repaying Kindness Pagoda, and a red paper strip that read, "Tourists Climbing the Pagoda, One Dime per Person" appeared before our eyes. We paid the price of three dimes and were able to climb the seven-story pagoda, looking far and wide, the lakes and mountains were like paintings, the desolate countryside, the scenery was in our arms. At this time, we were as happy as if we had ascended from hell to heaven.</p>
<p>On the way back, we wanted to take the train to the South Station, but unexpectedly, because we were too busy looking at the scenery outside the window, we passed the station; we staged a comical scene. When the ticket inspector came to check the tickets, and it became clear, everyone couldn't help laughing at the time, there was such a thing. The ticket inspector kindly told us to get off at Xinzhuang and take the 6 o'clock train back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Xinzhuang, we all said that this was really unexpected, that we would come to visit Xinzhuang today. Although we waited in Xinzhuang for more than an hour, we almost explored all the towns here.</p>
<p>It is said that there will be a lantern festival here today! This is the "Lantern Festival celebrating Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's victory over the bandits." There are four dragons and ten lions, so beautiful. An wanted to watch the lantern festival before returning to Shanghai, but there was no night train, so she didn't succeed. In the end, she didn't have time to watch it.</p>
<p>After six o'clock, we were all still hungry, because there was no good food in the town; but finally, like two long snakes, the train brought the three empty shells of confusion, and left Xinzhuang and advanced towards the long journey.</p>
<h3 id="e324">Spring Rain on the Bund <a href="#e324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>-- Wen Hei</p>
<p>The spring rain on the Bund was falling in fine strands. On the Bund, I looked at the magnificent buildings of the factories in Pudong across the river, hidden in the mist. The coolies on the docks were carrying goods up and down the ships that brought the remaining products of their foreign countries to the Chinese market to dump. The sounds of "Hang yo, hang yo" and the whistles of the small steamships on the river were harmonizing. A wanderer wearing an old winter coat and carrying a cracked paper umbrella stood at the tram stop at the intersection of Nanjing Road, waiting for the tram. This person was neither a hero who bore heavy burdens and went far away, nor a little beggar who made a living by picking up crickets. He was an average person like the bustling masses. At this time, he came from the French Concession, waiting to take the tram to North Sichuan Road to borrow money from a friend. What did he borrow money for? Of course, like the ordinary and poor masses on the Shanghai Bund, he borrowed money to pay rent and food bills.</p>
<p>The spring rain was like an affectionate woman, drizzling and falling in a lingering manner, but the wanderer, who had things on his mind and no time to appreciate the rain scene on the Bund, felt annoyed and depressed. At ordinary times, he might feel that the drizzling rain scene, with streets and houses hidden in the mist, had a poetic picture, or it might arouse his creative impulse, or he might improvise a poem or two, or write one or two essays. However, at this time, the landlady's cold face and the restaurant owner's smilingly hypocritical expression were still lingering on his mind. He was also worried about whether the friend he was going to borrow money from was at home, and even if he was at home, whether he would have money to lend him. He didn't feel any creative impulse at all, and he had no interest in appreciating the scenery of the Bund under the spring rain.</p>
<p>The tram was always late in arriving. Our wanderer, holding a broken umbrella, stood in front of the Cathay Hotel and had no choice but to constantly run to the intersection of Nanjing Road and stretch his neck to look towards the ball park, but no matter how long he waited, it didn't come. Today, the No. 1 tram was deliberately making fun of him. He looked at the clock tower of the Jianghai Customs, it was already 4:50. He became more and more anxious. If his friend was not at home, and he was out for dinner, what should he do? He didn't have money for the return trip! He looked at the copper coins in the pocket of his old coat, which he had actually been playing with in his hand for a long time, which were only enough for one tram ride. He regretted buying a pack of cigarettes just now, thinking that he would definitely be able to borrow money. As soon as he thought of cigarettes, his subconscious mind taught him to take out a cigarette from his pocket, light it, and smoke it. It was supposed to dispel some depression and boredom. An old man from the countryside, also wearing an old coat, walked towards him in the rain, "Sir, I don't have money to go home..." and asked him for alms. This aroused a smile in his heart. He thought, "I can barely pity myself, and you're asking me to pity you!"</p>
<p>The spring rain on the Bund was drizzling and falling in a lingering manner, as if the sky was also weeping.</p>
<h3 id="e325">Viewing a Women's Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Women Workers' Play (Part 1) <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 28th of last month, the Women's YMCA on Yuanmingyuan Road held a performance by women workers. Thanks to a friend's introduction, I had the opportunity to attend.</p>
<p>Having never seen a workers' play before, this experience provided me with many valuable lessons. Below, I would like to share some of my personal thoughts. Since the May Fourth Movement, China has seen the beginnings of modern drama. When I was in middle school, I was drawn to this new trend out of personal interest. We probably haven't forgotten that plays at that time lacked complete scripts, or even any scripts at all. It seemed that the world's famous plays were superfluous to China, and it was also true that the general public didn't understand them at all. This phenomenon persisted for a long time. The so-called "civilized plays" were simply a few clever performers improvising on stage, eliciting insincere laughter and tears. Until recently, we still saw so-called "spoken dramas" in various amusement parks, staging "Pearl Tower" type civilized plays, a clear case of false advertising. At the same time, in recent years, Chinese drama has progressed significantly in both content and form, thanks to the efforts of many progressive playwrights, certainly more so than when we were children. Therefore, the drama movement in China has a considerable foundation. This means that, due to the rapid progress of the audience, the essence of drama</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>has been deeply understood by a segment of the population.</p>
<p>The question we should ask here is: Why does "civilized drama" still exist today? Of course, there is a social basis for this.</p>
<p>I remember five years ago, I had the opportunity to perform as a coal miner for an audience of shop employees. In the noisy crowd, our performance had almost zero impact, even though we performed sincerely and diligently. However, their impromptu performance of "Wang Xiao'er Celebrates the New Year" was very well-received. Also, not long ago, we performed half of "Noble People" during Children's Day. Because we didn't know beforehand that the audience was entirely elementary school students, they didn't understand "Noble People," and we made a big joke of ourselves. However, their children's play, "Sparrow and Child,"</p>
<p>made them very happy. Similarly, in amusement parks, in front of the "civilized drama" stage, there are always many audience members who enjoy the performance.</p>
<p>These are all valuable lessons: audiences with limited understanding cannot appreciate material that is beyond them, otherwise our performances will become laughable. Regarding this point, the women workers' play at the Women's YMCA</p>
<p>provides valuable insight. They performed three plays: "Little Red Padded Jacket," "Sister Xiang," and "Street Scene at Night."</p>
<p>"Little Red Padded Jacket" is a three-act play about a poor family. The mother makes a red padded jacket for someone else, but the little daughter thinks her mother is making it for her. The mother deceives the daughter, saying she is making it for her to wear during the New Year. When the New Year arrives, the little daughter sees the red padded jacket being worn by someone else</p>
<p>and starts crying. The choice of subject matter and the theme of this play are, of course, ordinary and realistic. However, there is no fixed script, and the so-called three acts each only last two or three minutes. But every actor is very casual, without the so-called serious atmosphere of the stage. However, both the dialogue and the actors' movements are very colloquial, and every audience member can understand them. In particular, they speak in the Shanghai dialect, and their movements are in the style of "civilized drama," which they are very familiar with. These are the main conditions that determine the success of the performance. On the other hand, in terms of the drama itself, the demands are very low, and it is very naive. Perhaps gentlemen and ladies will not be able to help but laugh. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Hua Fengchun was unbearably angry: Taking advantage of their focus on watching the pearl, he quietly drew the knife from Huang San's body. Hua Fengchun swung the knife, and chopped off the head of Ding the landlord. The senior teacher screamed, "Oh no!"</p>

<p>— Bai</p>
<p>Since the promotion of the New Life Movement, the student community can be considered the most vigorous in its implementation. Posting slogans, holding speech contests, everything is done with the air of "transforming into a perfect New Youth within five minutes." This week, our school also has a so-called "dormitory cleanliness competition." The student council has also appointed inspection committee members to conduct on-site inspections of each dormitory to show that they are serious about their work, and that they will do what they say. And there are also methods of warning and reward. 'Beneath heavy rewards, there must be brave men.'</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, a dispute ensued. Anyone passing by Dormitory Four could see a declaration posted high on the door, which was quite striking. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration of the Residents of Dormitory Four</p>
<p>We do not seek superficial cleanliness, but we guarantee the cleanliness of our character! Go to Dormitory Four and you will find a clean and simple</p>
<p>setting, but there are absolutely no books that corrupt the mind, nor are there expressions of despicable behavior. We disregard the superficial; we value the inner self!</p>
<p>Of course, you will not find the cleanliness you seek in our dormitory---although we have the cleanliness that you do not want---please go back!</p>
<p>Our slogan is: "We say what we can do, and we do what we say." Don't go crazy for some false honor! Do not be a tail-wagging sycophant? Do not blindly follow. Do not imitate hooligans.</p>
<p>"Men of fame are naturally carefree."</p>
<p>This declaration and slogan are obviously an attack. Perhaps the students think that the occurrence of this incident is unfortunate, and that it is dishonorable to publicize it to the outside world; but I think this is precisely the exposure that has long been needed, the exposure of the dark side of the student community. It is not just our school, similar disputes are constantly brewing and breaking out in schools in various provinces and regions. Not talking about the dispute itself, the background of this dispute is worth mentioning. I don't need to say things like "Every student is a member of the student council, and should do their best for the student council and promote its perfection," because everyone knows that. But, or perhaps everyone also knows that the student council is just like a corner of society, with struggles, suspicions, connections, and sabotage, with... all the dark sides of society first sprouting in schools. How to struggle, how to connect, those who have been through school understand, and there is no need to waste words. It is in this way that this dispute has been brewing for quite some time before erupting.</p>
<p>I have a general feeling of anger towards the residents of Dormitory Four---I am dissatisfied with the organization of the student council, but I do not sympathize with their actions. Those who do not understand the truth think that they are bad elements, troublemakers, deliberately sabotaging the New Life Movement, and will never forgive them for feeling dissatisfied with the imperfection of the student council. Our Chinese teacher once said, "The New Life Movement is difficult to implement among three types of people, one of whom is men of fame." They insist on shouting the slogan "Men of fame are naturally carefree," wouldn't that make it even more certain? But, indeed, the student council often becomes a small political stage; with struggles, suspicions, sabotage, and connections, just like those highly self-regarded hermits venting their grievances against despicable politicians, this dispute erupted for this reason.</p>
<h3 id="e328">School? <a href="#e328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>It is already the fourth year, and they are still admitting such a large group of new students. This has been questioning in my heart for a long time, and the answer I got is: the school is only seeking tuition revenue, and the students are just muddling through to buy a diploma.</p>
<p>Six new classmates came to our class, and somehow they all became close friends in a short time. I learned from hearsay that the origins of these people are unclear, and what I saw with my own eyes is enough to prove that the rumors are true. The gold-trimmed Western suits are bought, but I haven't seen them turn a page, or even come to class! Even if they come, they just ask someone to take attendance for them! Yes, the school is a hotel, the students' goal is to muddle through to get a diploma, and in the future China will produce several more high-level idlers.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, there are a few of the six who have some special skills in books. Therefore, before any test or assignment, I always hear some of them say to one: "X! You read the book for tomorrow's test! We are busy playing, and we can't understand it anyway, so you have to take full responsibility! Roughly speaking, the professors are very careless, and once they become strict, if they don't allow a Pass, then please write a few more papers for us and hand them all in for us." Or "XX course papers are needed tomorrow, X, you just do a few more pages. Actually, when you hand it in to the teacher, will he really correct it for you? Reading is really meaningless, so I haven't even bothered to buy books recently, if I have money to buy books, I won't buy things to eat; ha---ha---it's really funny, besides us, there are many people in our class who are working as scribes, and all the homework is copied from others..." Three months have passed like this, and the monthly exams are considered Passed, haha, what have they gained? The monthly exams can pass like this, what about the final exams? Let's see what they do!</p>
<p>One afternoon, I discovered that the six of them were whispering in the campus, I walked past them, and accidentally heard; "Don't worry about the final exams, I have already planned it for you. I guarantee you will graduate with a square cap." Ah! Their magic power is really great, no wonder they can be so happy. But the money of fathers and brothers is only used as a tool to buy diplomas. But what exactly is a diploma such a big deal? Can it definitely solve our lives?</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, their finances have run out! Otherwise, why don't they eat lavishly like before? Why are they borrowing money from people? Therefore, I also heard that one of the six is planning to seduce the daughter of a wealthy businessman in XXX middle school, and it is said that he has already spent a lot of her money.</p>
<p>I came to this highest institution of learning from my hometown with enthusiasm, but what I have seen and heard everywhere is disheartening. Ah! The university is just this kind of "school", and university life is just like this!</p>

<p>— Bai Rong</p>
<p>The thin twilight of late autumn.</p>
<p>A quiet street: the sound of people, the sound of cars and horses have long disappeared in the air, what cannot be eliminated is the catkin-like clouds滞 lingering above the head. Piles and piles decorate the sky, like ancient brocade. The setting sun, like a lazy tourist, gazes at its future vaguely and melancholically. From the horizon, from the treetops, dusk so easily flows in, it pours into this cool street, blue paving stones, round windows full of poetry, a garden decorated with vines in August, and then gradually disappears in the dim lights, and the night comes to cover everything in front of us.</p>
<p>It's quiet, quiet and a little cold, wutong leaves floating everywhere like the thoughts of someone who has left their home.</p>
<p>Even the street lights are cold.</p>
<p>Perpendicular to the shadow of the street lamp, black, is a young girl's body, a slender figure, leaning on the side, with the desolate taste of a late-blooming flower, in the evening wind, everything is floating: skirt, hair, plain body······ the only thing that does not move is that fixed gaze containing sorrow.</p>
<p>This gaze is staring ahead.</p>
<p>In front, there are deep lights, deep shadows of trees, deep night, all black. But in front of her life, like this, is also unfolding such a black picture, and it is a panoramic black, rough, blurry, dim, without street lights radiating light, without tree shadows that add beauty, and that pavement, there is only a dark night scene, no motherland, no home, no relatives, she is lonely being abandoned in this trampling big city, she has to pretend to smile and comfort strangers every day, wearing away her youth like this, but she is not a bad person, she needs love, can love, knows how to love, but people just don't want these things, thinking of this, she reluctantly looked at the sycamore leaves飘 fluttering on the ground.</p>
<p>One piece, two pieces, three pieces, so circling, dancing····· two pieces, three pieces, four pieces, circling, dancing, so rushing forward····· rushing to the gauze window透 passing the sound of the piano--</p>
<p>It is not clear whether it is orange or madder, a piece of gauze so tight that it flattens from the treetops of the扁 pine, like the beautiful moon of the remnant night, singing flows out from there, as light as a forgotten childhood dream. Swinging to the street, swinging to the corner of the fence, and then disappearing in the darkness, hearing such a gentle tune, who wouldn't think of their own home?</p>
<p>Yes, she couldn't help but quietly think of her own home.</p>
<p>But "home," such a kind and familiar word, in her memory can only evoke some unpleasant impressions. It is not that she has no home, her home is in the distant, distant east of the sea, a land of ancient customs, filled with brilliant cherry blossoms. She remembers that when she was ten years old, because her parents could not afford it, she carried such a light small bag, containing childish and ridiculous tears, and was brought to this ancient China by her uncle. When she first came, she was not used to anything, but now, can't she use a foreign language to maintain her own survival? Isn't she穿 coming and going every day on the streets and alleys, as if in her own homeland? Thinking of this, some dreamy feelings came to her heart. Eight years have passed, but these eight years have not passed quietly! Eight years ago, no one would have thought that they would fall into this kind of state, in fact, as long as her uncle was alive, she would not have this day of East floating and West lodging.</p>
<p>The dissatisfaction of real life provokes memories that have not been revisited for a long time, and she thinks of her uncle again----</p>
<p>Thin and tall, with a smile on his face, he often put himself in a square kimono, peacefully smoking cheap paper cigarettes, calculating the accounts under the lamp, so smoking and calculating, eight years slipped past from his hands. But in the spring of that year, I don't know what kind of demon he was caught up in, he even ran to Hongkou regardless of the property in the store, to do some便便衣隊去 plainclothes team work. The machine gun rang all night, and the threat of death pushed her to this quiet concession. Following that was the cannon, right? Following that was blood, right? Following that was the shout of killing that lit up the sky with fire, right? No one collected the remains, they were piled up, of course they are easily forgotten, like her uncle, her friends, like many Chinese people.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the other hand, when people wanted champagne, she ended up working as a waitress in this hotel.</p>
<p>Her name is Katsuko, for the sake of sounding better, it is now changed to Meilian.</p>
<p>She has a beautiful face, a little silence, and a little pure heart.</p>
<p>She can smile lightly, but now, she can't laugh.</p>
<p>Placed in front of her, behind her, left and right, the past life is like a magical web, so entangled, rotating, that the scenery really makes people 目迷 dizzying·······</p>
<p>"The authority of the Empire! Homeless travelers!"</p>
<p>Sighing, she pulled her clothes, locked her worries in her heart, and dragged her lazy steps forward, passing through a dark street like this.</p>
<p>It's quiet, quiet and a little cold, wutong leaves floating like the thoughts of someone who has left their home.</p>
<p>Road運運路灯 The road transport lights are all cold.</p>

<h3 id="e330">Unexpected Harvest <a href="#e330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>"Yes, this, this, is the harvest I had imagined!" Ming, pondering, couldn't stop the excitement from washing over his mind.</p>
<p>The time was the season of mid-spring. Humph, "spring", what a charming word! That "spring love" spread over the hearts of young people, that "spring wind" kissed everyone's faces; gently, softly, sweetly, blowing, floating. The peach blossoms in the vase were welcoming it with smiling faces, the rosy cheeks of the girls revealed intoxicating dimples, the Western women half-naked showed their seductive bodies, that······ these, active, turbulent, mixed with a charming charm, but completely ineffective for Ming.</p>
<p>Under the 75W milky white light bulb, it emitted a bright light, swallowing all parts of the room. Right there on the nearby table, a piece of paper whiter than the light was lying quietly, on which, the strong and powerful handwriting created by the Waterman ink and the Parker gold nib was swaying and pacing into Ming's eyes.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was emotion or stimulation? He just silently leaned on the edge of the table. His eyes blurred, as if a layer of light silk covered his eyeballs, and he stared blankly in a daze.</p>
<p>When a gust of autumn wind in spring blew past, how cool it was! Then, he woke up. Involuntarily, recalling and thinking!</p>
<p>That was in mid-autumn a few months ago, I don't know if my friends were intentionally joking or sincerely saying;</p>
<p>--Ming, why don't you write a novel? No, a novella is fine, it's more satisfying than a short story.</p>
<p>--Hum, write? Satisfying? Write what? What is satisfying? Come on, don't fantasize! The result of fantasizing will be encounters that shatter your imagination. At the time, Ming had also secretly thought this.</p>
<p>Immediately, he realized something, because he knew himself, how could a moron like himself be praised by friends? Undoubtedly, they were mocking themselves, that is, an insult to themselves!</p>
<p>Humans ultimately have a heart of "upwardness," no, it's more real to say "anger" than to say upwardness. Because of this, his mood was disturbed for many days.</p>
<p>---However, what genre to use?······ Bankrupt</p>
<p>rural area? Yes, how fashionable, taking this kind of subject matter is as fresh as "taking advantage of the fire to rob." But, no, I have never squatted in the countryside, and I don't know whether the sun is red or white when it comes out. This, is the first shot in my life, and it must be as powerful as a blooming bomb, and it must never be so reckless.····· Then, fleeing famine? Famine year? War disaster? Yes, it also has the same effect as before, but·······</p>
<p>---Finally, he discovered this sentence: "Literature is the precursor of all social trends, and a reflection of life." Really, according to this principle, I should write what is reflected in my life, that is not only powerful, but also can arouse sympathy, maybe····· hey!</p>
<p>The manuscript was finally completed under the condition of "nothing is difficult in the world, just afraid of thick skin." Then, what made him</p>
<p>The difficulty that arose was: "Where to submit it", in this modern society with different doors? At this point, distress tightened around him, and the courage from before diminished.</p>
<p>After all, the manuscript was sent out, and the place it was accepted was a publication that flaunted "no prejudice, welcome external manuscripts." Gently, Ming sighed three times, and all the weight seemed to be removed.</p>
<p>A week, two weeks,······ published, did not see his name on the advertisement, and published again, the same vague; a spoonful of cold water extinguished the flame in his heart, he thought: "Isn't it published? No, no, then, why don't you send it back? Humph, who knows!" Suspicion, destruction, frustration, all kinds of emotions were fighting with each other　　One evening when the lights were on, the postman delivered a large envelope, vaguely, the handwriting on the envelope was jumping along with his heart. Opened it, is it? Original manuscript, untouched, is considered polite? Also attached such a clean piece of letter paper; this, is somewhat of a loss.</p>
<p>·····Your manuscript has been read, the beauty of the wording and the depth of the meaning are very admirable,····· but because····· temporarily······ so······ Still pray······ is the prayer·····</p>
<p>Some people say that the mystery of Chinese characters lies in the application of "beginning, continuation, transition, and combination." Here, it is clear that the meaning is "the text is simple and cannot be applied", but under the "transition and combination" situation, the traces are completely erased. The unstoppable excitement was washing over Ming's mind, he pondered----</p>
<p>----Yes, this, I had imagined it long ago. Humph, no prejudice? External manuscripts? Scam, in short, this is the only harvest of an unknown literary beggar!</p>
<p>Novel</p>
