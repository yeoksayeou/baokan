<h3 id="c9">興建西疆鐵道管見 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>前據報載。中委傅汝霖有興建西疆鐵路之計劃。其路綫擬由西安直達新疆之伊犁。一俟隴海路全綫完成時。即行開築。聞隴海路可於本年六月間完成。此一計劃若能賡續而起。則新疆與腹地之交通。即可從此打通。唯傅氏之提議。由行政院發下鐵交財實四部會商後。迄未見有何具體結果。究竟前途如何。尚難逆料。</p>
<p>我國今日。百廢待舉。然以財力支絀。進行建設。自當統盤籌劃。分别先後。此一原則無論何人。不能否認。然究竟何事應先辦。何事可稍緩則應從長考慮。年來政府對於交通事業。日益注意航空公路。進行尤力。顧以我國幅圓以大。既往成績。决難自滿。自政治經濟。及人口分配種種方面觀察。西疆鐵路之建築。實爲急不容緩之事。一則新疆逼處英俄兩大之間。自九一八以來。俄有覬觎北疆之謀。英有窺伺南疆之心。年來該省之變亂。幾無一不與此國際背景南關。益以新疆民族複雜。漢人與漢回不及三分之一。餘爲種族文化悉異之纏回。常以「興纏滅漢」自相號召。設我不早定大計。將來必至益形棘手。俄自土西鐵道告成之後。新疆之形勢。至爲危殆。計其出産十八爲蘇俄所吸收。與我腹地。反日見隔離。喧賓奪主。莫此爲甚。我國徒以鞭長莫及。唯有坐視事態之演化而不能有所處置。苟能由西安築一鐵路。直達伊犂塔城。更築三數支綫。貫通南北二疆。則縱或一旦有變。中央軍隊。即可迅速調遣。内變固可不起。外患亦將稍戢。此就政治言。西疆鐵路亟應建築之理由一也。</p>
<p>更就經濟利益言。建築鐵路亦爲開發新疆之要着。如阿爾泰山之金。與外蒙黑龍江鼎足而三。始能開採。足供我國改行金本位而有餘。迪化伊犁綏定之煤藏。隨地皆是。僅亞於山西。餘如煤油銅鐵玉石藴藏之豐。幾不可以數量計。伊犁一帶。又有綿延數百方里之森林。足抵我國在吉林之損失。南疆和闐疏勒等處。絲綢農産與江浙相似。祇須鐵路通達。即能與我腹地。調劑有無。此就經濟言。西疆鐵路亟應建築之理由二也。</p>
<p>據倫敦大學經濟史教授湯恩楠一九三0年來華考察之結果。中國人口大部集合於三大流域之中下游。沿海各地。尤爲稠密與人口絶稀之邊疆比較。殊不平匀。吾人更考沿海各地之人口狀况。覺其密度之高。實在多數國家之上。如日本向以人口過剩爲言。到處侵略。實則其本部之平均人口。每英方里不過四0七八。而我國沿海各省。則遠在其上。如山東平均人口。爲每英方里六一四人。浙江爲六五七人。江蘇爲八九六人。太湖區域竟達六千人。成都平原達二千人。珠江下游亦甚稱稠密。以是而觀。吾之人口過剩。實較日本。尤爲迫切。甯可不更早爲之所耶。東北三省向爲北方入口宣言洩之尾閭。九一八後己爲日本所强佔。南洋一帶以及南北滿洲。限制華僑活動。又甚嚴酷難以</p>
<p>發展。今日而謀沿海各省人口問題之解决自以向西北安插爲妥善辦法。新疆面積大於浙江十五倍。而人口僅有二百五十萬。不及上海一隅。其稀薄可知設西疆鐵路成爲事實。則凡過剩之人口。稍得政府援助。即可遣之入新。以爲開發之先驅。沿海各地人口過剩生活艱難所演成之匪患。差可末减。一舉數得。無過於此。</p>
<p>至於如何進行建築。則有二點應加考慮。一爲人工。二爲經費。我國養兵一百餘萬。除供内戰而外。可謂無所事事。若欲言裁。後成匪。爲患尤大。爲今之計。不如以之築路路成。沿綫屯墾。以資警備。兼事農畜。如是則兵不裁而自裁。開築西疆鐵道。即可採此原則。該路幹綫自西安至塔城計六千餘里。更築一周行南疆之綫約一萬餘里。以三元一里之價格計算。當須四五萬萬元之譜。如此鉅欵。國力必不能堪。然我歷年所舉之内債。總數亦達十數萬萬元。倘竟無法張羅。不得己而思其次。則舉行外債亦無不可。唯須不損中國之主權。全者借欵之國家。須以地理上不相毘連者爲宜。以防他日藉口護路。而佔領全境。演成東北之續。</p>
<p>閩變既平匪患亦减。統一之局。己見端倪。各方苛能和衷共濟。以國家民族爲懷。放大眼光。爲鞏固邊疆計。努力建設。則其所成就。當不止於新疆一地之開發。即東北失地之收回。亦不甚難也。</p>

<p>十一日下午五時、離京渡江、由浦口乘車北上、七時特快、人少位鬆、與滬平通車略似、惟新潔不如耳、車行三十五分鐘、抵安徽滁縣、見賣篾簍提籃活雞者甚衆、各販燈火、照耀如晝、滁人張德崇君上車、談城中有省立第八中學、學生數達五百餘、設備亦較完整、惟女子不得同學、隣縣亦無女中、故女子小學畢業、絶少繼受中等教育之機會、此殆江北大致相同之學風也、張君現在任全椒縣官廠辦事處主任、復稱皖省荒山荒圩甚多、全椒一縣、即達八萬餘畝、約占耕地十分之三、今己開墾半數、每畝售價、不出念元、官廠處尚赢大利云、</p>
<p>明晨五時、細雨濛濛、車抵銅山（即徐州）、城當津浦隴海兩路之衝、綰縠蘇魯皖豫四省、商業素稱發達、去歲因受不景氣影響、錢莊商號、倒閉甚多、爲時己久、市面迄無復蘇之生氣、由此往北、銅元祇通用「大枚」（即當二十文者）、若有當十小枚、即須於出此換出、計每八小枚、可得五大枚、銀角子或不同省名之角票、北地皆不通用、前往西北、若非取道綏甯、在此即應轉車西行、</p>
<p>魯境滕縣、小販多售滿筐黃梨、價廉且便携帶、但質粗味淡、中看不中吃、車行窗眺、雨歇雲霽、萬頃麥畦、葉苗己長二三寸、行列整齊、間以黃土、直若「黃地起緑條」之大花布、北人種麥成行、雅非南國亂播可比、畦旁多懸微着春意絲絲下垂之柳綫、其上且有小鳥、飛躍如梭、每於火車嘠然停止之後、即悠然聞其啁啁亂鳴之聲、大有自鳴其自由樂趣之意、古謂「大塊假我以文章」、信不謬也、</p>
<p>魯境河流、雨期則漲溢、乾期則全涸、而變爲道路、水利少見、大水如黃河、尤售多而利微、古今治理、竟未發現一勞永逸之善法、故田地灌慨、多恃井水、人力或牛力絞没之、事倍功半、井數甚多、井口砌石置杆、占地面亦復不少、此外耕地、雜埋墳墓、壘土如邱陵、附裁土地神碑、皆足以使耕地逐步减少、有請田野葬墓、若干年後、經風雨剥蝕、大可變小、小可變爲平地、但究須年代久遠、且石碑仍舊屹六、確非改良不可、</p>

<p>甲·新疆主要産物、年運綏遠轉天津出口數額、爲羊腸子三百萬根、總價二百四十萬元、羔茬皮十五萬張、七十五萬元、庫車黑羔皮六萬四千張、二十二萬四千元、古城黑羔皮二萬張、二萬六千元、油漢獺皮四十五萬張、四十萬零五千元、狐皮三萬張、二十七萬元、狼皮四千張、四萬八千元、貂皮三百張、一萬三千五百元、掃雪皮七百張、二萬八千元、灰鼠皮三萬張、二萬四千元、猞猁皮一千二百張、二萬一千六百元、野狸子皮二萬五千張、三萬七千五百元、野猴子皮三千張、一千五百元、狐腿子二萬二千對、一萬七千六百元、鹿茸四千斤、八萬元、羚羊角四百五十斤、二十七萬元、總計十六種、共價四百六十一萬六千七百元、以上各物、係據駝運時代之調查、將來汽車通行、皆可適於轉運、數額當可驟增也、</p>
<p>乙·此外新疆主要産物、仍由甲項路綫出口、尚有祇適用於駝運者、爲馬鬢馬尾十二萬斤、總價八萬四千元、巴哈白羔皮四萬五千張、四萬零五百元、庫車白羔皮三萬張、二萬四千元、古城白羔皮二萬二千張、一萬九千二百元、哈薩紅羔皮六萬四千張、二萬五千六百元、青山羊皮二千五百張、二千五百元、山羊板皮一萬四千張、四千二百元、狗皮三千張、五千一百元、駝毛二十五萬斤、十二萬五千元、美糧棉花二十二萬斤、三萬六千元、白羊毛八十二萬斤、一萬六千四百元、雜羊毛一百十一五萬斤、十七萬二千五百元、乾鹿角四千斤、二千元、葡萄乾十八萬斤、五萬四千元、貝母六萬五千萬、一萬三千元、枸杞一萬三千斤、四千二百元、蘑茹二萬斤、一萬八千元、白幸羊皮二萬四千張、三萬六千元、總計十八種、共價六十八萬二千二百元、</p>

<p>棉花·葡乾·等等、每年輸出綏遠一帶之數量、較前則减少百分之八十以上、其與年來到處發生之經濟恐慌、物價低落、出口停滯、固屬不無影響、但其主要原因、則以蘇聯自土西鐵路完成之後、環繞新疆數千里、處處與我邊疆接壤、運輸極爲便利、故對新疆、不但認爲唯一之成品推銷市塲、且認其原料之充分取給地、年年種種經濟侵略之企圖、進行不遺餘力、且值新省内亂頻仍、東部交通斷絶、更予以一絶好機會、故此刻新省原料産品出口、與夫成品之入口、己完全被蘇聯操縱、甯非可惜國人倘再不通力合作、急起直追、使西北交通、日趨發展、藉以挽回既失之權利、則前途隐憂、誠方興未艾也、</p>

<p>新疆物産豐富、由上列出超數字、己可見其一斑、往年土希鐵路未建築之先、其數字當較此爲更大、蓋自該路建築成功以來、上列各輸入貨物、除捲烟·茶葉·呢絨·綢緞·書籍·國藥·等、與往年無甚出入、其他各貨、靡不大受俄貨排擠、日趨减落、乃至百分之七十以上者、此外如煤油·汽油·臘燭·火柴·砂糖·鋼鐵·五金·棉布·平布·瓷器·玻璃·等、鎖額年達數千萬元之大宗貨、今己全由俄貨取而代之、於此可見蘇聯在新經濟勢力之鉅大、然皆由交通便利有以成之也、</p>

<p>青島市長沈鴻烈、於前晚由杭抵滬後、昨日上午八時許、由王曉籟·劉鴻生·陪同渡浦、分别參觀各工廠、至下午五時始返寓邸、即與國聞社記者作下列之談話、</p>
<p>[P此行任務</p>
<p>沈氏略謂、余此次南來任務、可分三點、（一）關於政治方面者、各地方行政事件、土産之推銷與减輕税率事件、己在京與行政院·財政部·實業部·交通部·鐵道部·分别接洽、結果均極圓滿、（二）接洽關於工商經濟事件、（三）參觀生産教育事件即職業教育與社會教育等、</p>

<p>際此世界不景氣聲中名地均有捉襟見肘之感、青市雖未能例外、然所幸應付得法、故尚不至呈枯竭之象、查青島土産、以花生米爲大宗、其次則爲花生油、現對此等出品之推銷、如運費之减低、税率之減輕等、均承中央核准、土産之不致滯銷、即經濟斯不致枯竭矣</p>
<h3 id="c126">參觀實業 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>余此次在主洋作政治上之接洽後、即分赴鎭江·戚墅堰·無錫·杭州·等處參觀實業、於昨晚（即前晚）抵滬、今晨（即昨晨）承王曉籟·劉鴻生·兩先生陪往浦東分别參觀中華火柴廠·搪瓷廠·章華呢絨廠·中華煤球廠·水泥廠·等處、（昨爲星期日、各廠均停工、由總經理劉鴻生特令開工、俾陪沈氏參觀、）俾作實業之借鏡、蓋一方面爲國貨謀推銷、（如前次國貨流動展覽會、在青陳列三星期、售貨至五十萬元、）一方面後投資於青市、即所謂接洽關於工商經濟事件者也</p>

<p>近來我們接着許多信、都是要讀古詩詞、和古書的，更有一位讀者借了一本陶淵明生活去讀，但没有看完就送還圖書館了。他説「在終日忙碌中、那裏能够去看我們的書呢「？但依我們想，這恐未見得罷？他不能讀書，倒不是忙碌，没有工夫，或許是因爲他所讀的書不能使他發生興趣，没有吸引他去讀它們的力量，他纔趕快送還它了呢。譬如他所借的「陶淵明生活」那本書，的確是祇應該「依然恭敬地奉還」，而不應該讀的。因爲這些書讀了，不但不能磨勵志氣，更不能指示一點向上，前進，奮鬥的途徑，却反而有使人頽廢，躱避現實，去追求一種幻想世界的危險。因此，我們就借着這椿事做開端，來談談一般人讀古書是否獲益。</p>
<p>具有上述這種毛病的書是很多的。大概可以分兩種：一種是那書中所説的東西己經是過去了，它所説的話己不能再在現在來應用。譬如「孟子」一書罷，孟子託古改制，將古代聖君賢賢！如文，武，伊尹丨時代的社會制度，寫得娓娓動聽，定出一套治國平天下法則，希望後世人摹仿，但是我們知道現在國家對人民的關係，己不是君主治理百姓的原則，那些「治百姓」方法還有什麽用呢？現在我們一般人雖要納税，却不要爲皇帝家做工，所以那種希望皇帝諸侯减輕徭役的主張，根本是不合時宜。另外一種書則因爲對於生活不滿意，又無改善的辦法，於是躱避現實，專門去追求一種理想中的樂園，但結果則流於頽廢，消極。大半的古書，從四書五經起一直到各家文集止都可説是前一種，後者則古代許多詩人如阮籍陶淵明等的詩，一直到最近的武俠小説都是的。</p>
<p>我們現在讀陶淵明的著作，以及一切關於他的著作，是能兼受上述二項壞處的，所以就拿他做例子，來説明我們所以反對一般人讀古詩古文，古代著作以及頽廢著作的理由。</p>
<p>陶淵明是個曠逸的詩人，一般人都以爲他的詩並不是頽廢，却是瀟洒脱俗，但我們則以爲他是躱避現實，而躱避現實即是志氣沮喪的表現，使人趨於頽廢的捷徑，</p>
<p>一個人並非生而要躱避現實者，其所以要如此，完全是因爲現世界上殘酷的鞭子把他美麗的幻夢給擊碎了，使他無法在現世界中得到，於是他便把一切實際生活視爲「俗」務，視爲齷齪，而在精神上去追求，幻想出一個玄秘美妙的樂圜。陶淵明本來並不是一個頽廢者，並不是一個把世界一切都置之度外的人，這可從他的「責子」一首詩裏看出，他有五個兒子，却「總不好紙筆」，他嫌阿舒懶惰，阿宜「不愛文術」，阿雍和阿端到了十三歲連「六」與「七」還不識，阿通一天到晚祇曉得吃梨與栗。這些兒子他都不不高興，但他没有辦法，於是只好説「天運苟如此，且進杯中物」罷！换句話説，説是自己且去享樂，一切事都不必管了，因爲管也是没有辦法的，但這還祇是把俗事不管，他還有更進一步的主張呢，「不覺知有我，安知物爲貴」？把自己都忘了，自然與世界争了。　　但陶淵明所追求的理想生活是什麽呢？他所追求的是一榆柳蔭後簷，桃李羅堂前。曖曖遠人村，依依墟里烟。狗吠深巷中，鷄鳴桑園鑽。户庭無塵雜，虚室有餘閑」。這種田園樂境：是「長沮」，「桀溺」（長沮桀溺是兩個人名</p>
<p>，論語「長沮桀溺耦而耕，孔子過之，使子路問津焉」）等等人的田舍生活，樂道不憂貧生活，然這種生活，也僅可供神往，際上並無達到的可能，於是他老先生也不得不憂貧，不得不吃苦了。祇好説「瞻望邈難逮，轉欲思長勤」了，祇好説「田家豈不苦，弗獲辭此難」和「但願長如此，躬耕非所歎」了。</p>
<p>所以我們假如抱了爲實用而讀書的目的，存着爲解决問題而讀書的心，那末，讀陶淵明的著作和有關於他的著作時，就要先把下列幾個問題解答。</p>
<p>（一）生活痛苦，是否應當躲避，而另外去找一個精神上的樂園。</p>
<p>（二）生活痛苦是躱避得了的麽？</p>
<p>（三）我們是否還可學學陶淵明，要過過他那種田家的清苦生活？</p>
<p>老實説，以上的問題都祇能得到否定的答案：因爲生活痛苦不是躲避得了的，而是要以我們的努力，去剷除它們的根源的：而且歷史與人的生長一樣，我們老了的時候，追想兒童時的快樂，却不能再變爲兒童，所以我們「瞻望」古人的生活好，但實際上却是「邈難逮」，我們「轉欲思長勤，」自己去創造新生活。總之，時代是進化的，以後的生活祇有比以前好，資本六義下的生活固是痛苦的，但與封建時代相比却是天堂了。所以古代的生活我們根本用不着憧憬。</p>
<p>所以，我們應當讀一些描寫我們現實生活痛苦，指示我們解除這種痛苦的書，不應去讀那些與我們無關痛癢的書，因爲我們是讀書時間有限的人，是生活感受着極大痛苦的人。</p>
<p>或許，有人會疑惑，讀古人書未必摹仿古人，更未必會受書本的麻醉。那我們可以這樣回答是：我們的讀書並不是想做學者，也不是胸有成竹學有根基的人，他們正在期待着適當的精神糧食去培養自己呢。</p>
<p>一言以蔽之，我們反對讀者讀一切與我們時代相差很遠的，過去社會的遺著。至於專研文學和過去社會制度與歷史者，自然又當别論了。</p>

<p>— 清德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯述</p>
<p>▲介紹原著者</p>
<p>這部書原本是英文，書名LmperialInedse，西曆一九三三年（即去年）由紐約陶德曼圖書公司出版。原著者就是曾經寫過「清宫二年記」，「金鳳」等等幾部書的德齡公主　　德齡是滿清宗室裕庚公爵的女兒。裕庚早年曾做過出使英法等國的出使大臣，因此他的兒女從小就跟着他在西洋各國游歷，受了很高的西洋教育，差不多每個人都能精通四五國文字。他們姊妹兄弟一共有五個，其中除一四兩人（都是男的）故世較早，默默無聞外，餘下三位，都享過很大的聲名　　德齡行三，在清宫執事很久，爲西太后所最得用的女官，待遇亦較别人爲優：當然，大半的理由是因爲西太后知道伊</p>
<p>曾經出過洋，能寫关洋文，能説洋話的級故！</p>
<p>後來伊嫁給了一位在上海當美國副領事的Mr·T·White，不久就一同回到了美國去。回去之後，伊充了一家報館的新聞記者，我們的女作家便在那個時候開始了著作生活，先後曾寫過不少關於清廷秘史，以及西太后個人生活文字，其中最著名的，而己經有了譯本的一部，便所「清宫二年紀。」</p>
<p>伊所寫的作品雖然因爲是受了伊自己的環境的影響，全是用的英文，但是伊對於祖國的文學，也很有研究，能够做很好的詩和詞曲，可惜我這裏没有現存的可以介紹。</p>
<p>伊今年五十六歲、己是一位年高德劭的老太太了。不幸在四五年前，伊和，Mr·T·White偶因發生意見，竟至謮婚。離婚在新大陸當然是算不得什麽大事，不過我們想伊在過了五十歲之後，還遭逢到這種變故，確然是很可憐的。尤其是一個黃色的人種，獨自孤零零地飄流在異國，更是多麽的凄凉哀痛？（一）</p>

<p>第二十六回慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國</p>
<p>凄凉對玉鏡嗟我懐人</p>
<p>那種隔靴搔癢的安慰，不但自己不受用，反是覺着煩膩，不如不讓他知道，倒乾净些。他如此想着，那一口怨氣，正想吐了出來，却又吞了下去。但是這口怨氣雖吞因下去了，那兩隻眼睛裏的眼涙，却是萬難再爲容忍，順着兩邊臉腮，掛珠子一般，掛着兩串，年拖到嘴角邊去。爲鏡子己經昏沉看不見影子了，所以自己那兩行眼涙却也看不出來，自己也不會感覺，並不去揩抺，讓眼涙由臉上更滴到衣服的胸襟上來，他一人坐在屋子裏，這樣的對着鏡子發愁，而且又是風雨之夜，緊關了房門的，他以爲總没有什麽人會知道的。然而他今日怱怱的進城去，怱怱的又跑回家甸來，這事情太可怪了。他雖是説出了原因，乃黃小姐不在家，然而他臉上的表情，很不自然，却很是可疑。加之他吃過晚飯，静悄悄的就進房去了。也有些可怪。自從趙自强從征以後，江氏就就時刻刻注意看他的行動了，今天他這樣的態度，豈有忽略過去的？所以桂枝在燈下對了鏡子流涙的時候，江氏在窗户外面，己經偷看得久了。自己原來也不懋在這樣的黑夜裏，進來勸解他，驚動了趙老太爺的，後來看到桂枝將壁上所懸趙自强的一張相片兩手捧着，默然相對，那眼涙水就連連的滴到那相片上去。他的胸脯，一起一伏，似乎在那裏作那無聲的哽咽。這一下子，可把江氏嚇倒了，莫非他想拙了，要尋短見。因之情不自禁的就在外面呌了一聲道：老姑娘，你怎麽了？還不睡覺嗎？（三五二）</p>

<p>— 維經</p>
<p>普通的一張臉，只須在戲院子的後台上，搽些兒鍋煤，便成爲張飛，抹上一臉石灰粉，便算是曹操。待到戲完了，把臉凑上臉盆，用胰子在臉上一陣子洗，再用面巾兒一擦，便又回復了本來的面目。</p>
<p>這一種事情，唱戲的行話，呌做鈎臉，其實就是普通人所謂化裝。</p>
<p>説起了化裝，我又想起了一回事。某一回子，作者也是逢塲作戲，跟着幾位朋友去尋花問柳。在一大羣鶑鶯燕燕之中，我看中了一個桃腮杏靨，美得無可形容的神女。於是興之所至，就滅燭留髠了。待到第二天早上醒來一瞧，不得了，臉上的脂粉，剥落了好幾塊，從脂粉脱褪的所在，瞧到了原來的臉皮，不只是黃，而且佈滿着焦黑的雀斑，眼梢額上的皮膚，竟一絲絲的顯示着皺意。唔，這麽的一副嘴臉，不扯謊，我老婆或許還比伊美上三四十分哩。但是，過了些時，在某處，眞是天緣巧遇，又在無意中遇到了伊怪，依然像一位十七八歲的大姑娘，在伊臉上，找不出一些可憎的徵象。</p>
<p>我於是乎不得不贊歎着化裝的偉大。雖然到底還是要露出本來的面目，但是在未褪裝之前，確有轉乾爲坤之力，改頭換面之功。</p>

<p>春姊把香甜温柔的櫻吻，噓接在大地上的自然物，都蘇醒了冬眠。苗兒萌芽；花兒蓓蕾；枝兒幹兒都抽條；葉兒説卸了鱗片，舒展開了。春光明媚，春氣氤氲，滿園春色，撩醉了人們的情緒。我們既没有石家的金谷，還是學淵明守拙事田園吧！從前於陵仲子辭了卿相，而桔橰灌圜。樊遲清學爲圃，孔子道：「吾不如老圃。」俄小説大家托爾斯泰嘗乎指窗外的田園，對友人道：「這是我的樂籠呀；裏面具備種種藥劑，可治療人們種種的疾病，母須仰給醫生和藥肆了。」從這樣説來，藝花種樹，固然是雅人深致，我們從事田園，不是很好的工作嗎？在這春光明媚的時候，還是來談談田園吧！</p>
<p>（一）　　一名油菜，因産於闐國蕾　地方，得名。丨一説雷　縣在陜西丨在植物學上，和芥，薺，菘，菜菔，蕪菁等，同爲十字花科。因爲它有黃色的花瓣四片，綴成十字形呀。花裏有四長二短的雄蕊六個，雌蕊一個，柱頭分爲二歧，以便吸受花粉。花裏還是蜜管，以供蜂蝶的吮食，瓣中有一種發揮性的香氣，時時散布空中，以誘昆蟲的飛集；因爲它是「蟲媒花」啊。葉大，色濃緑，没有葉柄，葉脚緊緊地包裏莖上。花後，結成紫褐色的長角果，成熟後，綻裂子出，這便是菜油的原料，可吃，也可爲燃料。綜計：　　的莖葉，富於氮鈣，鐵等原質，爲有益人身的蔬菜植物。油不但是可代燃料，並且是供給人身脂肪的要素。一圃黃花，幾畦蕾　，爽心悦目，適口充腸，眞是寳物咧。</p>
<p>（二）豌豆它是蝶形花科植物，又説豆科，和紫荆，苜蓿，蠶豆等等，都是同類。它的花很美麗，有旂瓣一片，翼瓣二片，龍骨瓣二片，合成一朶蝴蝶形的花。花裏有九合一離的雄蕊十本，柱頭有毛的雌蕊一本，當然也是「蟲媒花了。葉是羽狀網形複葉，莖端有捲鬚，所以能够蔓延在他物上，果實呌做「莢果」，種子可以煮食，味很鮮美。莢和莖葉，可飼牛馬。它種的豆類，也有可以榨油，造麫粉的，丨這是最近的發明丨爲出口貨的大宗。惜夫出豆最富的東三省，己經改了顔色，不曉得損失多少利權呢！滿園蛺蝶，栩栩欲活，蒔幾畝豌豆，既供食品，也供欣賞呀。</p>
<p>（三）苜蓿又名紫雲英，上海人呌做草豆，和豌豆同屬蝶形花科。大别爲三種：一種呌做」紫苴蓿」，莖高尺餘，開紫花，和豌豆很相似。一種呌做「黃苜蓿，」莖蔓延地上，花黃三瓣，莢狀如鐮刀。史記大宛傅，有「馬嗜苜蓿」之句。後來漢使把它的種子拏到中國來，中國從此便有苜蓿了。還有一種呌做「野苴蓿」亦名」南苴蓿」，這便是上海人所説的「草豆」了。它的土名很多，甬人呌做「草子」，或名「金花菜」，「盤歧頭」，「紫雲英」也便是它的别名。莖臥在地上，葉爲三小葉片所合成，小葉倒卵形，頂端凹入。花小色黃，形狀很像一隻小蝶。夾作螺旋形，生了許多細剌。南方各地，都可以栽植，所以有「南苜蓿」的名稱。苜蓿和豌豆的根上，都有許多「根瘤」，裏面富蓄氛素，是一種極好的肥料；所以把它們的老根老莖，　培土中，足以滋養别種農作物呢。</p>
<p>（四）蕪菁一名大頭菜，是蔬類植物，也是十字花科植物。根圓形，多肉，葉很大：裏面極富養料，味很甜美；和豬肉烤食，尤妙不可言。春日開黃花，和　　很形似，田園中不妨種植吧！邵長蘅慕其先世種瓜青門者，（邵平）自號曰「青門老圃」。世變日亟，恨不能去而爲青門老圃啊！</p>

<p>—三比零—</p>
<p>▲上半時雙方各無所獲</p>
<p>▲下午時優游連進三球</p>
<p>昨日西聯足球唯一之甲組賽一塲優游暨南會師於棒球塲上、皆持前日退票而來、故觀衆亦可達三千餘人、雙方動作、極乾净爽脆、爲華隊比赛中罕有之好現象、上午時雙方攻守互見、難分難解、下半時優游發奮有爲、連續打進三球、暨南前鋒、打門人材、僅持一羅海光、故祇有聽優游攻打、而無法翻本也、</p>
<p>局勢沉悶兩無所獲優游開球、朱生發與奚巧生、稍一轉瞬、即闖入暨南禁地、孫鐵腿扣門、小梅湧身跳起、擊球出險、家球二度進窺、劉始贊躍起頂出、鍾勇森闖至低綫、傅向中路、孫鐵腿併力低射、小梅安然接得、引起四座彩聲、暨南三鋒、亦不時予敵人以威脅、唯以聯絡不熟、難得效果、鍾勇森十五碼處一射、爲横柱擋駕、在劉始贊搶球與鍾勇森同時跌倒時、上半時亦隨之告終矣、</p>
<p>春雲乍展家球立功下半時開始、優游即施强硬手段、屢對暨南作露骨之侵略、朱生發横傅、鍾勇森急射、梅妹妹之九寸金蓮、救駕有功、俄而妹妹撇下空門、作還方之游、奚阿巧急射空門、觀衆大驚、幸門矮球高、免此大難、但不久孫鐵腿盤旋門外、久久不去、暨南衛士莫不耽耽而視、冷不防斜剌裏鑽出陳家球砰然一腿、紀録遂開、</p>
<p>錦上添花巧生得手暨南顧尚勷忝爲中軍大帥、失去一城、其憤慨當可言想、遂與海光後先嘯聚徒衆、報國興師、但六出祁山、依然難如心願、鍾勇森深入後防、巧生環腿掃門、稍偏一尺、而暨南門前是非叢起、混作一團、劉始贊往來奔走、救出險球不少、妹妹亦偷寒送暖、週到十分、奚巧生乘人不備、偶一得勢、即發腿打門、球高且急、於是暨南再失一城、</p>
<p>天山三箭勇森張弓長脚小羅、　　憤慨溢於屬字、統束三軍、權來北伐、在萬馬軍中、張弓搭箭、思中紅心、但唐永純安然接得、不然則可以擊破湯獮矣、少焉球出於西北之角、徘徊東南之間、朱生發勾至門前、梅洪寳轉身來搶、鍾勇森如飛趕到、送入門中、成三對0之比、此後暨南屢思背城借一、祇以時乖運舛、終難登堂入室、於是乎敗矣、</p>

<p>市一體育塲工商業餘足球競賽會、於昨日上午十時、舉行末塲之决賽、與賽者道字組之曙光滬民兩隊、上半時、曙光向南順風而攻、得天時地利之助不少、戰不五分鐘、即獲一球、無何、曙光又利用罰球機會、輾轉傅遞、蹴進一球、下半時、滬民反守爲攻、勢極勇猛、惜每失之毫釐、而曙光又乘虚而入、攻進一球、遂得以三對0之比數、榮膺該組冠軍、論實力、滬民不弱於曙光、只以守門員臨事慌張、致遭意外之挫折、惜哉、</p>

<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>以上所述者。古人對於傷寒温熱及時行之區别也。而大致皆本於陰陽大論及王叔和傷寒例。其謬誤之處。吴又可己有相當之駁正。見於吴氏温疫論。今摘其要如下。於以倡言非古者。早有其人。古人之言之不足信。非自今日始也。吴又可曰。「十二經絡。與夫奇經八脈無非營術氣血。週布一身。而榮養百骸。是以天眞元氣。無往不在。不在則麻木不仁。造化之機。無刻不運。不運則顚倒仆絶。然風寒暑熱之邪。與吾身之營衛。勢不兩立。一有所干。疾苦作矣。苟或不除。不危即斃。風寒所傷。輕則感冒。重則傷寒。即感冒一證。風寒所傷之最輕者。尚爾頭疼身痛。四肢拘急。鼻塞聲重。痰嗽喘急。」惡寒發熱。當即爲病。不能容隠。今冬時嚴寒所傷。非細事也。反能伏藏過時而發者耶。」此乃吴氏駁陰陽大論「不即病者。寒毒藏於肌膚。至春變温病。至夏變爲暑病。」之言。亦即駁素問生氣通天論「冬傷於寒。春必病温。」之言也。直向千古所奉爲醫學之聖經放矢攻擊。吴氏眞千古一人也。吴氏又曰。「更問何等中而即病，何等中而不即病。何等中而即病者。頭痛如破。身痛如杖。惡塞項强。發熱如炙。或喘或嘔。甚則發痓。六脈疾數。煩燥不寜。至後傅變。不可勝言。倉卒失治。乃致傷生。何等中而不即病者。感則一毫不覺。既而延至春夏。當其己中之後。未發之前。飲食起居如常。神色聲氣。纖毫不異。其己發之證。勢不减於傷寒。况風寒所傷。未有不由肌表而入。所傷皆同營衛。所感均係風寒。一者何其懞懵。中而不覺。藏而不知。一者何其靈覺。感而即發。發而狠厲。同源而異流。天壤之隔。豈無説耶。既無其説。則知温熱之原。非風寒所中矣。」吴氏以爲中而即病。中不即病之言。古人無有明確解説其理者。後之人。徒爲無條件之盲從。而不思追求其説之所從出。以致積非成是。習僞爲眞。故逐層拷問之也。嗟乎。吾國醫術。苟用吴氏節節追求之法。尋其根據。將無往而不見荒謬。其能得通明之解説。是以自立於天地間者。蓋千不得一。皆隨聲附和。莫明其所以然者也。使吴氏生於今日。其不爲醫學革命之急先鋒。吾不信也。今之舊醫。奉無説之説。而强作解人者。皆吴氏之罪人也。</p>
<p>吴氏又曰。「日言寒毒藏於股膚之間。肌爲肌表。膚爲皮之淺者。其間一毫一竅。無非營衛經行之地。即感冒些小風寒。尚不能稽留。當即爲病。何况受嚴寒殺厲之氣。且感於皮膚最淺之處。反能容隐者耶。以此推之。必無是事矣。」此吴氏就其寒毒藏於肌膚之言而攻之也。</p>
<h3 id="c208">謀民族健康的一條路線「衛生教育」 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 翁之龍</p>
<p>構成民族的各個份子之健康，與一個民族的强弱，有連鎖之關係。所以近代歐美各國，對於民族的衛生教育，推行最力；誠以要造成未來的鬥士，不獨在科學戰具的研究和發明，尤要養成一般民衆有抵抗的體力，和堅忍的精神。回顧我中華民族，仍懵然罔覺，近數年死亡率的統計，其數字殊堪驚人。民族健康的落後己然事實昭著了。前年奉命赴歐，考查醫學及公共衛生，覺彼邦舉國競競於民族的健康，莫不以公供衞生爲一致努力的標的，所以衛生教育，在我國今日的情勢上，非特别加意不可。就鄙見所及，應從下列三方面進行，方可稍有希望。</p>
<p>（一）家庭衛生教育</p>
<p>俗説少成若天性，習慣成自然，所以兒童習慣的養成，至爲重要。而習慣的養成，是完全要靠家庭，做父母的應當在第一上，要佈置一個適合衛生的環境，使兒童生活其間。凡關於衣食住一切起居的消極的防衛，以及積極的體育方面之講求，都要時常對他們講解，使他們成爲習慣。此外如飲食衛生及性教育等知識的灌輸，也要注意。如衛生圖畫的展掛，各項衛生理由的説明。應當不憚繁瑣的對他們詳細解釋，以鞏固其衛生信念，這都是非常重要的。我們普通家庭，多未能顧慮及此，殊爲遺憾</p>
<p>（二）學校衛生教育</p>
<p>學校是社會的模型，學生是將來參加社會上各項活動的份子，所以在學校裏心性的陶冶，習慣的養成，以及知識技能的傅授，是學校應負的使命。教師們若知道衛生於民族健康的重要，就應當特别注意此點，將校内的一切的一切，都把他造成一種合乎科學的衛生境地，使學生耳濡目染，於無形中養成了衛生習慣，此外於上衛生課及體育等課時，也應當詳細的説明，使其了解，丨丨最好多備掛圖，模型，幻燈等使之觀察，以確實其衛生觀念。丨丨鄙人前在教育部討論現定各級學校課程標凖時，曾提議中小學加授衛生課，現在己經確定了，實是幸事。因學生有了衛生常識，一方面既可以注意於個人衛生及預防疾病；一方面他們回到家庭，或將來服務社會，也可以帮助家庭，社會，國家的衞生事項之推行，及宣傅衛生的重要，其力量是很大的。我國各级學校，除少數注意及外此，其餘的多是設備不全，談不及此，至爲可惜。此後應設法多加衛生設備費，以積極進行爲是。</p>
<p>（三）社會衛生教育</p>
<p>社會爲民族的各個份子棲息之所，環境不良，丨丨不合衛生丨丨健康上就受其影響。此是市政府政方面應當特别注意的。我覺得除街巷的整潔，水道的通暢，以及公共衛生設備的佈置外，最好於每一居民薈萃之處，設一衛生博物館，内備衣，食，住，行的模型標本掛圖等，呌居民常去觀覽，以使模仿改良。並應多開衛生講演會，請有醫學衛生知識者，常去講演，利用掛圖，統計表，幻燈等件，使居民的衛生知識增進。以辦理市政府政的衛生機關内，應當組織一個公共衛生調查指導部，從事於各居民家庭的衛生事項調查與指導，由消極積極兩方面，以改良各居民的衛生。丨最好是每一個地方，都設公共醫院一所，此種機關，即附設其内，丨丨由此談來，市政府政上的公共衛生的預算，也應當事前確定，並須要寛籌經費，從事於此。</p>
<p>以上所云，僅就感想所及，拉雜言之，至於辦理衛生教育的具體方案，容有餘暇，再行草擬，以就正於海内專家，而謀求實現。</p>

<p>（答）尿中含有蛋白質，和酮體。</p>
<p>（問）脾臟有什麽變化？</p>
<p>（答）猩紅熱病人的脾臟，有輕度的腫脹。</p>
<p>（問）在恢復期中症狀是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）進了恢復期，有層片狀或膜狀的皮膚落屑。最初發疹的部份，最初落屑。</p>
<p>就是頸部先行落屑。</p>
<p>（問）猩紅紅熱病人的合併症，有那幾種？</p>
<p>（答）最多的合併症是咽頭腎臟心臟和關節等部的病變。</p>
<p>（問）咽頭的合併症是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）咽頭發炎，起潰瘍，有纎維素沉着，成黃白色的苔皮，很像白喉，</p>
<p>（問）賢臟的合併症是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）在早期就現蛋白尿；到第三星期的時候，來賢炎，這是很重要的；那時候體温又上昇，顔面浮腫，全身水腫，現腹水和胸水等病狀。尿量减少；大多有出血性尿。尿中蛋白質很多量，含有多數上皮細胞，圓柱體和血球等。往往發尿毒症。</p>
<p>（問）這種猩紅熱性賢臟炎，要經過幾天纔得自愈？</p>
<p>（答）經過有一二星期纔得輕快；就此移行到續發隆的萎縮賢。</p>
<p>（問）心臟的合併症是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）心臟的合併症，往往發心内膜炎心肌炎和心包炎等。脈搏於是非常頻數（有時達一四０丨一五０）</p>
<p>（問）關節部的合併症是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）上下肢關節像手指膝等現腫脹疼痛、發熱，甚至化膿。</p>
<p>（問）猩紅熱的診斷，從那幾點着手？</p>
<p>（答）從高熱，咽峽炎，發疹，覆盆子舌，膜狀落屑，頸淋巴腺腫脹等，着手診斷，不很困難。</p>
<p>（問）猩紅熱病的預後，吉凶怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）大都不良，死亡率約百分之三到十。凡咽峽壞死，腎臟發炎，心臟發病的都是危險之兆。</p>
<p>（問）療治猩紅熱，應當怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）應當命病人静臥，防止室内的乾燥，使蒸汽放散於病室之内。食品用流動性或半流動性。皮膚塗消毒性軟膏。用過氧化氫或鹽酸鉀水漱口，頸部貼氷囊，内服利尿藥，强心藥，注射猩紅熱治療血清，在早期效力確實。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c210">煤油是可治療肺病麽？ <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 楊郁生自日本東京寄</p>
<p>吾國有一種最壞風氣，不可不自覺！即居國各種事業，處處落後，而好採東西洋的最新學説，一味盲從，不加審辨；所以數十年來，一切文化，仍無進步，殊可浩歎！</p>
<p>最近在醫學方面，讀上海報，有人盛倡煤油可以醫治肺病，於是有許多肺病患者，遂貿然嘗試，其結果如何，我不得知，然爲預防危害，及想念患者徒受慘痛，不得不掬誠相告！</p>
<p>煤油醫病，是日本速水寅一及岩本義虎等氏所宣布，是日本所倡導的新療法。肺病本是極慢性，極難愈的疾病，今既有此奇效方法，誰不樂從，然在日本擁有醫學識最大權威各名家，再加詳細實騐，煤油飲用，非但無益，且有極大之危險。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>東京帝大醫學部藥理學主任林春雄氏云：肺病全在療養，煤油治病，完全是俗説及錯誤之宣傅，殊不可靠。</p>
<p>日本慶應病院醫學博士平井文雄氏，有大篇文字發表，（見日本讀賣新聞昭和九年一月二十八日）其結語有謂結核菌？經種種試騐，比其他各細菌，對於類脂肪體，其抵抗力較强。煤油决非</p>
<p>有效之殺菌劑，病人如好飲煤油，則菌類未被殺死，而資貴之人命，反被煤油毒害，漸趨於死途矣。</p>
<p>東京帝大醫學部長與又郎博士，批評煤油可治肺病，完全是迷信。並爲全日本百五十萬患者憂慮而戰慄。同時傅染病研究所結核室主任醫學博士佐藤秀三氏批評煤油治肺病，是無異令患者吞嚥昇汞水可以治肺病，有同樣之悲劇。</p>
<p>北里研究所附屬病院院長大谷彬亮氏加以實騐，謂此療法，毫無理由。或推測煤油是一種剌激療法，與俗人所謂魚熱，大蒜，日光俗，温泉浴，均屬民間相傅之土法，然在新醫藥上，殊害多而利少。</p>
<p>最近我曾親往東京市外市立療養所參觀，並將煤油可否醫治肺病之情形相研究，據該所長田澤鐐三氏將結核患者六十三名之長期試騐，初從小量，漸給與相當量，毫無效果。又於一部分病人，試飲大量，忽起下痢而衰弱。有多數病人，因飲煤油而噯氣嘔吐；有許病人，因飲用煤油而咯疾加甚，體温稍增。該氏曾將結核病　分數組：有一日飲一合，有隔日飲一次，有三日飲一次，其結果均發生胃症狀而其飲用，有時在食前，有時在食後，有時和牛乳同飲，然病人多數因苦悶而中止。在服用煤油期中，復發咯血疾者有之。田澤氏曾將試用報告登載日本醫報，極不贊成煤油治肺病之效力。</p>
<p>我現寓東京，考察日本最近醫事教育，接讀祖國寄來各報，曾廣載煤油可治肺病之學説，自問無此經騐，用將調查所得，掬誠宣布，俾免吾國肺病同胞，再作無謂之嘗試也。</p>
<p>按楊郁生醫師擅長内科，在浙杭獨辦西湖醫院多年，同界極有聲譽。此次因調查醫育而赴日，得便採録挽近我國甚囂塵上之療油治肺問題於彼土，藉供國人參考，此篇乃接其由東寄來之稿，特以介諸社會，企張附言</p>

<p>— 朱恒璧</p>
<p>溯自二十一年十月，本會在上海舉行合併後第一次大會以來，十五越月於兹。此十月五中之工作，其範圍大體爲大會所規定；施諸事實，括舉大端，計凡關於鞏固本會基礎者一，關於醫政上臨時之抗争者一，關於舉辦我國醫學上特殊研究之工作者一，關於砥礪會員道德者一，關於維護並增益會員利益者四，關於增進出版事業及編纂醫事便覽者二。請逐項略述如次：</p>
<p>（一）會所購置費之籌還本會會所購置費五萬元，原由本會籌借繳付。經執委會决議募捐籌還，在大會中及大會開幕後計共募得銀約四萬三千元。計會員捐助最多者有二千八百元最少爲二元。捐欵人數達全體會員三分之二。具見我會員諸公對本會有眞切之認識，故能踴躍輸將，悉本熱誠。捐欵二元，其熱心垂愛本會之價值，與捐二千八百元者初無二致。即前此一部份未及捐輸之會員，諒或因公忙，未及注意，或通知末周，本會募捐經過，尚無所知，要亦决非漠視此舉。此種精神，在我國其他學術團體，殊屬罕觀。想截至撰稿日止，所欠己僅七千餘元，會員請公苟鼓其餘勇，每人各捐五元，即足以抵償而有餘。所望在下届大會開會以前，能早捐足此數耳。</p>
<p>（二）中央制訂國醫館例之抗争中央特設衛生署，管理全國醫業事業，意本至善。乃又有駢枝機關國醫館之設立。其設立之初旨，在整理舊醫中藥。近乃變本加厲，且進而要求行政院劃分所謂國醫國藥撥歸國體館管理，所謂西醫西藥仍則歸衛生署管理。整個醫學，欲徧裁分爲二，所謂國醫，又絶無政究科學之根柢，其不利於我國醫學之前途，不言可喻。本會有鑒及此，特　派牛惠生，顔福慶二醫師面謁行政立法汪孫二院長，力言其不可，並先後具呈立法院致函各立法委員，據理力陳國醫館條例之不應予以成立。結果，立法委員雖不乏明達之士，斥其謬妄，惟仍有少數，别具成見，力主通過，雖與原案略有不同，而開倒車之處，仍所不免，此本會認爲我國衛生行政上絶大污點也。</p>
<p>（三）醫學研究工作之促進我國醫學問題，須待研究者至爲繁夥。如東鱗西爪，漫無系統，各自工作，不相聯絡，必致時間經濟，兩受損失。本會特組織醫學研究委員會，設計研究，推會員歐爾醫師Ｈ·Ｇ·Ｅarle總其成。本年研究題目爲流行病之統計。惟此項工作，斷非一二年所可蕆事。是以本會方另籌的欵，務使能賡續調查研究，以增益其工作之價值云。</p>
<p>（四）醫德之提倡及規勉我國之有新醫，計僅七八十年中事，歷史至短。而現在在各地開業者，品類不齊，影響醫界道德，殊爲重大。本會睹此刁風，爲保障人民生命，並提高醫德起見，特由報委會愼重討論，編印醫師條誡一小册，中英文分别裝釘，偏寄各會員，以資信守，並規定本會會員如犯此條誡，本會當予以勸告，勸告不從，予以警告，警告無效，則當促使出會，以保全我全體會員之純潔。想我會員諸公，對此必深具同情，接受條誡，身體力行，使我醫業得永保其神聖之地位也。</p>
<p>（五）雜誌之編輯本會雜誌英文部歷年所登稿件，皆極有價值。經林宗楊先生數年經營，内容愈益精美，自兩會合併，英文雜誌單獨發行，非特本會會員必人手一編，不時翻閲，即國外各醫學雜誌，亦皆必擇要摘録，以供研究。最近一年來本會對於會員之供獻，此節當可推首届一指。去年一月，並得北平分會會員之允許，如林先生出國遊歷，其他在平會員當可繼任編輯。此在我會員諸公前，亦殊可告慰也。</p>
<p>本會中文雜誌，亦同爲各會員發表心得，輯録醫學新知識之重要事。經主編李濤先生力求改進，以有今日。自本年份起，益求精進，除原有編輯，並請李濤先生仍任編輯外，經執委會添請余雲岫，龐京周，宋國賓三先生爲編輯，並准余先生爲主編，規定月出一册，以期能於恢宏原有質量外，復得吸收留德，日，法各醫家作品，盡量發表。倘亦讀者所業聞歟。</p>
<p>（六）醫師研習所之組織及進行國内各醫校畢業人數，不下六千七人。畢業後往往無復有進修機會，實爲憾事。本會特籌措相當經费，與國立上海醫學院，同濟大學醫學院，上海女子醫學院，震旦大學醫學院，上海市衛生局，全國海港檢疫處，寳隆醫院諸上海醫務機關，合組醫師研習所。集各機關團體之人才設備，以便訓練各種課程，備國内外醫師來所研習。其己開辦者有肺勞，内科，骨科，公共衛生，病理，生物化學諸科。研習時期。少或三週，多或四月。其課程之長短，全視科目之性質及醫師之志願而定。研習人數，總計己達四十人。希望以後開班其間，有志研習人員能踴躍報名入班，是則尤所盼禱者也。</p>
<p>（七）醫師業務之保障年來醫師與病家往往因業務關係，發生争執，甚至涉訟。病家之以莫須有之手腕，羅織醫師罪狀者，時或有之。本會爲保護會員正當利益，屢作不平之鳴。力所能及，無不以全副精神赴之。如最近合肥腦脊髓炎血清糾紛一案，合肥醫院醫師鄭信堅先生被控，本會廉得其實，以公正態度徵請海内董學專家發表意見，結果，僉認在學理上鄭醫師並無錯誤。因由本會綜合各專家意見，具呈法院，代爲剖析；冤乃大白。其他類是案件，不一而定。本會均曾盡力設法，爲之保障，以盡法團天職也。</p>
<p>（八）圖書室之整理及擴充國内醫學書籍，尚無大規模之專門圖書館。特如上海，中外醫師，人數衆多，而可供參考之書籍，殊欠完備。即間有一二機關，藏書雖甚可觀，但種類每偏於其所特别注重之一方面，非某種專家，不獲利用，普及之效，終不可得。本會特在會内另闢圖書室，廣爲搜羅，庋藏圖書。在最短期間，並擬綜集上海所有各學校機關醫學圖書，編爲總目，以供各地會員參考也。</p>
<p>（九）醫學書籍之編譯及發售本會編譯部原由前博醫會編譯部併入。惟本會爲增進出版事業計，特籌得專欵，添聘編譯醫書極有經騐之黃貽清先生加入工作。並在會内特設醫書分售所，以便推銷，而利會員之直接訂購云。</p>
<p>（十）第四版醫界指南之編纂醫界指南，己出三版。每届出版，資料必遞續增加。本届四版集稿，所增尤多。原釘一冊，至是遂不得不分刊中文本，英文本為兩部。中文本業已印就。載有十六幅之重要都市醫院地址圖，二十六所之醫學院校狀況調查，衛生署及衛生實驗處以下十四處之衛生機關概況四百二十四所之各省醫院，簡括調查，四千餘人之醫師姓名通訊錄，以及調查所及之醫校錄，各種重要醫事法規，現在在發行中之全國各醫藥學定期刊物目錄諸項搜羅之富遠勝三版。英文本亦早著手編印，約至六七月間，定可出版。</p>
<p>他如會員向衛生署登記及請領證書事宜，一年來為本會所經辦者，不下二百人，醫界在本會舉行各種會議，統計有一百餘次奔走接洽，亦頗忙碌。特本會職員認定會為醫界同人組織，當然為醫界盡力服務。會員諸公茍有所托，自當竭誠效命，不敢憚勞也。</p>
<h3 id="c212">肺病煤油治愈之實驗（四續） <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>（五）我係由病人告知煤油能治肺病而嘗試之</p>
<p>（我亦自己試服煤油而信其有效果之一人）</p>
<p>神户市攝津醫院内科醫學士千葉將喜談話</p>
<p>煤油對於人體無害，我在學生時代見汽車夫泰然飲下汽油，即己知之，曾有小兒誤飲下煤油，其父母慌張不知所可，我即告以此事，使之安心，但對於煤油能治肺病，則係由患者見告。我至今日亦己診過三人試飲煤油患者，其中雖亦有發熱，下痢，嘔哮者。但却未有最惡之例，大都結果皆佳。</p>
<p>我自己亦因肺門淋巴腺有異狀，故試用煤油五瓦，飲下三次，覺精神甚佳，照常辦事，自思係飲煤油治愈。</p>
<p>對於飲煤油方法，我以爲似以用吸入式爲佳，又對於飲下煤油之治療效果，亦望能蒐集愛克司光照相，從學術上加以證明。</p>
<p>X　　　X　　X　　X</p>
<p>（方婦之友雜記者附言）</p>
<p>本誌因接到九州方面讀者來函云：聞煤油可治肺病，是否事實，囑爲調查，記者初以爲煤油如何能治肺病，疑不敢信，但以受人之托，自然當爲之切實調查，及着手調查之後，乃驚其效果之確。</p>
<p>不問其理由如何，既然有如此事實，當然不能將其埋没。且此煤油療法既非爲射利而宣傅之新療法，亦非新藥品，乃一幾乎不要破鈔之療法。</p>
<p>此療法亦可謂最合窮人脾胃之療法，向來多數之療法，無論如何切合理想，多非富人則無能爲力也。</p>
<p>然此處所發表者，乃全然可不費錢之煤油療法，豈不使人雀躍乎。</p>
<p>煤油療法之治病實騐，一經調查其實例甚多，幾於不可勝記，因篇幅過長，姑止於此，待二月號再續行報告（按二月號未登出，延至三月號。）（完）</p>

<p>該廠設備之完善。既如上述。然無人材。以運用其設備。亦屬徒然。故該廠不吝鉅費。重聘各項專門人材。即供給試騐研究採取原料等所用之動物。己固定延請獸醫一人。尚須特約獸醫。以備臨時之需。臨證研究部。以實騐新藥出品者。亦固定有特約各科專門醫師。其審愼嚴格有如此。其餘可概矣。至不得己而借才異籍。則在人才蕭條之吾國。抑以製藥技術之才。更感缺乏。飽學技精之士固有。奈不敷支配何。國家猶有客卿之設。當不足爲該廠病。而應深諒之。該廠設備與人才之兩難並。宜乎出品精良。足與舶來品相頡頑。凡各種内服。外用，丸劑，片劑粉劑，液濟，注射劑等。咸能自製。其己製成而爲中西醫家所稱許樂用者。僅注射劑一項。己不下一百餘種。其中三分之一。爲最近一年内所製成。己馳譽宇内之賜保命，維他賜保命補丸等不計外。其他最著名之新出品。如維他賜保命注射劑。卵巢濾胞内泌素結晶體所製成之婦萬靈。肝臟結晶體所製成之力活肝注射劑，粉劑液劑。健神補血糖漿。自採原料所製成之陣痛催進藥，腦垂體線素注射劑。化學製成之長命新丐注射劑，内服粉劑等。均爲國内絶無僅有。該廠特製之精品。而最爲難能可貴者。則莫乙種維他命結晶體製劑若。蓋乙種維他命之結晶體。在世界科學界。猶屬最新之成功。而該廠竟在二十一年冬。己能在糠粃銀皮中提取乙種維他命。而再使之成功最純粹之結晶體。然後製成注射劑及片劑。如此偉大之成功。不僅爲該廠之榮譽。亦足爲醫藥萌芽時代之吾國。揚眉吐氣於世界科學界也。是等成績優異之結晶品。在該廠不一而足。均爲此一年中之新出品。誠非易事耳。</p>

<h3 id="c218">二十二年紡織類貨品進口貿易概觀概述 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 葉子休</p>
<p>二十二年進口貿易呈普遍低落之趨勢，其中紡織類减少爲尤著。</p>
<p>進口總額　　紡織類　其他</p>
<p>二十一年　　八九一　二二三　六六八</p>
<p>二十二年　　六九0　一一七　五七三</p>
<p>（單位：百萬關金）</p>
<p>他類貨品合計僅减少百分之十四，紡織類獨減少百分之四十八之多。二十一年紡織類佔進口貨品總額約四分之一，二十二年减爲百分之十七。紡織類貨品大都爲衣着用之消費品，在此農村經濟不振，國際貿易累年入超之情勢下，不可謂非差强人意者也。兹就其中主要項目之消長情勢略加分析。</p>
<p>棉布</p>
<p>翻閲進口貿易統計，首先見到者爲棉布。在己往數十年中，棉布進口總額常在一百數十萬擔至二百萬担左右，價值達一萬數千萬兩之鉅，居首席地位，誠當之無愧，但近年累年减少，進口額己大非昔比。二十一年進口數尚有八十餘萬担，價值六千餘萬關金；二十二年更减少爲三千萬關金，估計數量當己在五十萬担之内，當曩時之二三成而己。試就海關貿易月報逐項觀之，二十二年進口數較之二十一年進口數，在數十項中幾可謂一致减少，例外者僅寛幅洋紗，花標，未列名印花布，及條子府綢四項。即就此四項而論，亦各有特殊原因。寛幅洋紗原多用爲製手帕材料，價值特廉，進口税未能按照普通洋紗從量徵收，其從價税率受原價低落之影響而相形見輕，故進口貿易乃集中於寛幅品。吾人若將寛狹兩項合併計算，即可知進口額固依然有减無增也（數字總略）。花標進口以俄貨佔多數，俄貨品質比較厚重，用途寛與印花斜紋布相近，而與英日貨不類。二十二年俄貨花標進口增加，正與日貨印花斜紋布之激減呈對照情勢。條子府綢之進口增加，係烟舊税則分類簡單，一切染紗品均爲從價税，從價税輕，故條子府綢乃代替漂染素綢之地位。至於未列名印花布之增加，則因雙面印花布之取巧。尋常雙面印花布不過供裝飾用之零星去路，故舊税則歸入未列名品，從價徵税。從價税受原價低落之影響而無形减輕，於是一般普通印花布之原無雙面印花之必要者，亦故作雙面印花，從中取巧，而未列名印花布遂激增。總上所述，可知所謂增加者，均係項目轉移之結果，不足影響普遍减少之論斷，推棉布普遍减少之重要原因約有兩項。其一，生活優裕者首先講究衣着乃人之恒情，反轉言之，經濟困難亦自然先從衣着方面謀節省，捨高級舶來品而改用低廉之國内産品，自意中事。其二，國内工業原以棉紡織業較盛，在關税未自主前，舶來棉紗早己隨國内産量增加而减退，近年關税一再提高，棉布進口額隨之而减少，原甚自然，現行税則較之上届税則約提高半倍，係二十二年五月末方見諸實施者。查二十二年下半期棉布進口數借八百萬關金，較之上半期約減少一半，則今後棉布進口貿易之趨勢亦可想而知矣。兹將民元以來棉布進口數量列左。（單位：担）</p>

<p>二十一年　　　　　　八一六、七一九</p>

<p>棉花</p>
<p>二十二年棉花進口數爲一百九十九萬餘担，較之前數年减少甚多。前數年進口數激增爲三四百萬担，論者或視爲非常情勢，今又激减爲二百萬担，想又當以恢復常態爲言矣。然以余觀之，前數年棉花進口數量之激增，其中除去數十萬担係因價格奇廉而輸入，或可視爲非常外，其他大量激增原非意外，至今日之激减則反屬非常狀態也。何以言之，蓋棉花之供求與紗布互爲表裏，紗布進口即棉花進口，不過形式不同而己，實質上無多差異。查最近二十年中之進口統計，在民國初年棉花雖僅有數十萬担，面紗布兩項均在兩百萬担左右，外棉直接間接進口數己在四五百萬担之譜。歐戰以還，棉紗進口鋭減，故棉花進口漸增爲二百萬担。及至近年棉紗復由數十萬担减爲數萬担，棉布又激减百萬担，故棉花進口又激增至四百萬担左右。變形間接進口數减少，而直接進口加多，一增一减，總額常在四百五担之譜，故曰前數年棉花進口之激增並非意外。至於二十二年棉花進口數之又激增，則因國内棉産增加之偶然現象，與歐戰中之情勢極相似。我國最近二十年中棉産量，按紗廠聯合會之估計計算，平均在七百數十萬左右。歐戰時一度激增達千萬担，其時外棉直接間接進口數亦曾一度减爲二百八十餘萬担。二十二年國内棉産估計達九百數十萬担，同時棉花直接進口數約二百萬担，再間接進口數及東三省進口各各數十萬，亦當與二百八十萬担之數字不相上下。棉産豐收半賴天氣，此種偶然現象究竟能維持幾時，則端頼棉業當局之切實工作，否則好景不常，今後棉花進口數未必能常在二百萬担之内也。今將各年棉花直接間接進口數列左。（單位；千担）</p>

<p>棉紗</p>
<p>棉纱進口近年己爲數無多。二十一年因抵貨關係，英國細紗進口曾一度增加，二十二年又恢復低落之常態。總計全年進口數爲二萬七千數百擔，其中除輸往西南各口尚有普通貨外，餘多爲高級細紗。就棉紗貿易大勢觀之，舶來品己無足輕重。各年進口數如左表。（單位：千擔）</p>
<p>元年至四年平均　　　二、五九五</p>
<p>五年至八年平均　　　一、七七0</p>

<p>十九年　　　　　　　　　一六二</p>
<p>二十年　　　　　　　　　　四六</p>
<p>二十一年　　　　　　　　　九六</p>
<p>二十二年　　　　　　　　　二八</p>
<p>蔴貨</p>
<p>進口蔴貨大致可别爲粗細兩類。粗蔴貨以檾蔴製蔴袋爲主，我國常年進口數約百萬擔。二十二年進口僅十數萬擔。其原因有二。其一。蔴多供包裝農産品之用，我國需用以東三省爲最鉅，殆估全數十之七人，今己不在此項數字内。其二，米麥等品近年進口不在少數，年達四千萬擔，此等貨品大都用蔴袋包裝，以包皮重百分之一計，一年進口數己達四十萬擔，無怪空袋進口數一落千丈矣，細蔴貨以亞蔴布疋爲多，其中大部份供抽繡用，小部分供西服用。近年抽繡品出口貿易甚盛，而蔴帆布蔴花呢等西服料亦活躍於市塲，故亞蔴進口數由二十一年之二百餘碼，增爲二十二年之四百三十餘萬碼也。</p>
<p>毛紗缐</p>
<p>二十二年進口總額爲五萬三千餘擔，較之二十一年之五萬四千餘擔，減少極微。蓋二十二年春季世界毛貨價格奇廉、而國内銷路亦漸由中衣推至内衣外衣，由冬季推至春季秋季也。近二年國内國貨産量日增，舶來品亦正積極謀就地製造，今後國内消費量雖有一日千里之</p>
<p>勢，而進口量或未必有激增之可能。</p>
<h3 id="c219">呢羢 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>二十二年呢羢進口總額約三萬一千擔，較之二十一年之二萬九千擔，略有增加。推其原侵銷兩項。日本近年原毛输入激增。本其對於毛斯綸之特殊經騐，進而從事於平光呢類之出口貿易，原意中事也。至於服裝改變一節，近年尋常袍掛雖因關税提高，及綢緞低廉，採用呢羢較少、而整個形式之漸向半西式方面轉變，依然在進行之中。最顯著者。如春秋二季外套之流行，摩登男女人各一襲，所用材料十之八九爲舶來呢羢也。</p>
<p>人造絲</p>
<p>二十二年人造絲進口數爲六萬九千餘擔，</p>
<p>較之前一年之十萬擔約減少三成。此係表面上之數字，實際上並未減少。查日本人造絲出口向以我國爲主要市塲，據日本出口統計在民國二十一年份輸向我國本部者計二萬五千餘擔，同時輸向東三省者爲二千七百餘擔。二十二年份輸向我國本部之數量，截至九月，雖祇有三千餘擔，而同時輸向東三省者則激增爲二萬九千餘擔。再查東三省進口數，二十年裁至十一月己遵四萬四十餘擔。東三省　數絶無一年之間猛增十倍之理，其中走私轉口之多不言可知。此係專就日貨而言，若連同西貨由香港等處走私之數一併計算，則人造絲進口數之朗減暗增，殆可斷言。</p>
<h3 id="c220">搪瓷業之近况 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>二十二年度之上海搪瓷業，營業數額，共計國幣四百二十七年萬元；計：</p>
<p>益暨搪瓷廠　　　　一百十萬元</p>
<p>華豐搪瓷廠　　　　九十五萬元</p>
<p>中華琺瑯廠　　　　七十五萬元</p>
<p>久新琺瑯廠　　　　四十六萬元</p>
<p>鑄豐通記搪瓷公司　四十萬元</p>
<p>上海搪瓷廠　　　　三十四萬元</p>
<p>兆豐搪瓷廠　　　　十二萬元</p>
<p>其他小廠六家　　　十五萬元</p>
<p>照上項數額，雖不若民國十八九年那樣興盛，然較諸民國二十一年度，己增加百分之二</p>
<p>十。際此農村破産，各省紛擾不甯之秋，有此成績，己非初料所及。但祇此一隅生産，（按我國搪瓷製造工廠咸在上海）銷路及全國，營業所得，僅止此數，自亦未能滿意。一由歷年推銷路綫不廣，迄未深入民間；一由農人認識不清，尚多不知使用，或竟誤認爲貴族用品。實則搪瓷器皿，經多方觀察，以農民爲最需要，最適用，不特經用價廉，遠勝粗笨瓷器，和竹器木器，舉凡各式搪瓷器皿，幾無一不合乎農村需用，即若搪瓷之圓盤方盤用以曬粉，大鍋小鍋，亦可用以儲藏種子，均爲潮灦所不能侵入，蟲鼠所無法傷害，問其價值，均廉於竹器木器。奈現在農民中之能使用搪瓷器者。尚百人中無一人。故今後搪瓷業，欲其發達，非先向農民絶力提倡不可。若能如此，莫説每年四百餘萬元之營業額，即每日營業至四百餘萬元、亦非難事也。</p>
<p>搪瓷一業，本爲我國新興工業。當歐戰時，繼日人而起，十餘年來，急起直追，迄今除北方平津一帶，尚有日貨搪瓷銷路外，華南及長江一帶，日貨搪瓷，早經絶跡。初爲合力抵抗日貨故，凡可以謀同業合作事業者，無不團結精神，勇往直前。過去事實，斑斑可考，奈各廠每因歷史不同，致旨趣互異。又以人事之變遷，猜忌横生。自去夏國産搪瓷聯合營業所因故解約後，一般人因鑑於締約時之艱難，僉認解約爲可惜。但如形式雖離，精神能合，一若兄弟分居然，庸亦無傷。故自各廠各個營業後，均聲言維持隔年營業數額，俾得平均發展，既不侵犯他人，亦不肯自示弱點。而其同業公會中。爲防患未然計，更從中限制各廠生産，不使其貨品過剩，至又争謀出路，發生貶價競賣之惡習。經年以來，幸皆玉安無事。自二十三年度起，更進而試行生産統制，將上年限制生産一項，僅修訂細目外：對於原料購進，均擬聯合共同購買。不但躉購價目較廉，而使用之各種原料，從此亦得標準化矣，</p>
<p>搪瓷貨品價格，本係同業一律，比年滬市凋零，各省又農村經濟，瀕於破産，同業爲迎合買客心理起見、將正貨之外：另造副號貨，蓋具價廉於正貨，所以便於平民購用也。去年南洋一帶銷路，幸有此項副號貨品，不但銷額大增，而日貨竟大受打刦，因價目同等，而貨質則我優日劣，瓷是日貨無人過問矣。故去年春夏兩季，搪瓷業之銷路，以南洋一帶爲最。閩廣亦算不惡。惟長江一帶及川帮，則殊形寥寥。揆諸歷年營業情形，當夏秋之交，長江帮是交易，無不熱閙一時者，去年竟寂寞若此，此亦各廠初意所不料。待夏去秋來，依然不動，此時華南帮交易時期己過，各廠存貨山積，營業呆滯，經濟均發生恐慌。鑑於往昔减價之有效，不得己乃將價目再度减低，定名爲特價貨類。先將各廠所積存之次貨，及試騐製品，歸入特價類内發售。一聲宣傅，買者踵接。奈上項次貨和試騐製品，究屬有限，焉能普及。無奈買者但求價廉，不計工拙，設不繼續發售，正副貨件，依然無人過問，不得己忍痛將副貨權作特貨，以應銷售，九十兩月之營業額，竟至二百萬元左右，幾及全年營業額之一半。以稍稍减價故，竟能如此暢銷，咸莫名其究竟。待事後調查，方悉是被販買户窺破弱點，用以要挾，不啻受彼利用，蓋自一二八之後，各埠商界銀根緊迫，無可諱言，凡屬販買商號，均不願躉批商品。且其貨棧之中，不無有多少儲存，尚可用以出售，待售完批進，尚不嫌遲。一二八距今幾二年，各埠販買商之存貨，是均陸續售完。正慮無以應市，行將向滬廠躉購，故此時之搪瓷貨品，即不一再減價，亦有大批銷路，特未必擁擠於九十兩月中耳。搪瓶業因一時之過慮，無端犧牲貨價銀至四十萬元左右，此亦該業二十二年度營業上受到一種小小教訓也。雖然，當此提倡國貨時代，薄利多買，原係正當方式；失之東隅，不難收之桑榆也。</p>
<p>我國搪瓷货品，原係仿自東流。十餘年來，研究改良，不遺餘力，早經青出於藍，並駕歐美。惟以銷路多在上中社會間，故於式樣花紋，力求改進。即以面盆一項論，初祇有平邊捲邊等形，今進而製深形反口等式矣。花紋一項，初祇有藍花冰花等形，今則除電光印花噴花外，更進而製堆茶描金等式矣。至顔色一項，更愈製愈多，愈造愈佳，鮮明奪目，得未曾有　我國北方人民，對於洗臉盆，向喜使用銅質者，每隻價洋至三四元不　焉，自謂價值雖昻，用毁之後，尚有廢銅十餘兩可變賣作價。故上海邑廟一帶之銅器作，所製銅盆，年銷北方可四萬隻。自去年深形搪瓷面盆發售後，上項銅盆　大受影響，蓋多易銅爲搪瓷者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c221">一九三三年蘇俄之經濟 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 楊先序</p>
<p>蘇俄去年度最引人注目之事，即其國際間之地位更形鞏固。一方面德國之關係己較前進步，他一方面法國及東歐各國先後與蘇俄締結友好條約。而美國十一月之承認蘇俄，更爲經濟上政治上重大之事態。</p>
<p>去年度蘇俄仍着重其内國經濟及財政政策之改進。關於工業建設方面之進展雖甚平稳，而對過去己建立之一切企業，則絶力促進。工業方面，出産之增加率，雖僅百分十六，而一般的出産增加率，己達百分之二十二。據官方數字，去年一般工業所得者加百分之九·一·重工業則爲百分之十一·五，大宗工業之勞動生産率·增加百分十·二·而生産成本方面分别減少百分之一·五至二。關於勞動生産率之</p>
<p>所以能增加，因一九三二年未曾規定一種法律，對於工人及僱員之無故曠工者加以嚴厲之取締。換言之·凡工作人員若非因重大事故而曠工者，概不發給麵包證。</p>
<p>自全部工業觀察去年度確有相當之成功。但有若干部門，未能完成其預定之生産程序。鍊鋼業僅完成百分之七十八·森林業僅百分之七十八·六，玻璃業百分之七十一·六，紡織業百分之九十五·四，依第二次五年計劃之預定今年大宗工業之出産應增加百分之二十一，重工業百分之二十三，輕工業百分之十·六，一般消費貨物之生産，應增百分之十六。</p>
<p>關於一九三三年度財政部份，照預算應收三百五十萬萬盧布，支出三百二十萬萬盧布。而實際上歲入者竟達三百九十二萬萬盧布，歳出者三百六十萬萬盧布。國家工業及商業機關之營業税，本爲蘇俄國家歲收最大之來原，比項竟較原來預計，多收得十二萬萬。更有二十萬萬盧布之收入，超出其所計畫之食品及機製品販賣而得。並有六萬萬盧布，係自發售國家公債而來，支出方面較預計超過之十五萬萬盧布，係發展經濟企業之用。地方預算增加四萬萬，農業從職人員之薪金超出二萬萬盧布。至於今年（一九三四年）之預算。應收入四八，八七九，四一六，０００盧布。支出四七，三０八，四一六，０００盧布。並以一，五七一，０００，０００盧布作準備基金。照預算方面觀察，經濟企業由二四，八六五，九００，０００增爲三三，三四五，七００，０００盧布。社會及教育事業由二。三四一，三００，０００增至三。０一六，０００，０００盧布。行政費由二，四００，五００，０００增加至二，八八九，八００，０００盧布。關於軍備預算之增加則不巨，由一，四一六，六００，０００增爲一，六六五，０００，０００盧布。然吾人决不能以此而下任何斷定，因重工業方面尚有一一，三六０，八五０，０００盧布之存儲金。任何時侯均可以將其撥爲增進軍備之费用也。</p>
<p>蘇俄去年之國際收支己較前進步。於一九三三年前三年之國際貿易均爲入超。吾人可於下列見，（以金盧布一千爲單位）</p>
<p>一九三０年　　一九三一年　一九三二年輸出　一、０三六、三七一　　　八一一、二一０　五六三、八四四</p>
<p>輸入　一、０五八、八二五　一、一０五、０三四　六九八、六九三</p>
<p>至一九三三年全部統計尚未編就。但前九月之輸出共爲三六七，三六四，０００盧布，輸入共爲二七四，二八五，０００盧布。計出超九三，０九七，０００盧布。及歷年來之入超，今己一變而爲出超矣。輸入方面，各國均行減少，英國前九月共計輸至蘇俄者，僅二四，九在八，０００盧布，而一九三二年同期，則爲七一，四０一，０００盧布。减少之數達四千六百餘萬。德國方面由二五四，二五五，０００减爲一三一，四八三，０００盧布。</p>
<p>據史丹林之宣示，蘇俄在國外之商業債務有一時期竟達十四萬萬盧布。至一九三三年此項商業債務己减少爲四萬五千萬餘盧布。蘇俄亦爲産金國家之一，據計現在每年出産者在一萬萬金盧布以上。</p>
<p>去年蘇俄農業發達足以驚奇春冬兩季收成均極佳，蘇俄當局擬此爲前所未見之豐收。據官方最近發表之統計。主要之農産物一九三０年之收成爲八三，五四０，０００噸，一九三一年爲六九，四八０，０００噸，一九三二年爲六九，八七０，０００噸，一九三三年爲八九，八００，０００噸，當歐戰前蘇俄最豐收成之一九一三年爲八０，一００，０００噸，故一九三一及一九三二年者均相去一千萬噸左左。而官方之宜稱，則謂人民所食之物品較歐戰前加多，尤以人口增加急速，較一九一三年己增二千五百萬。然一九三一年有一九三二年兩年之收成較一九一四年革命前任何年所收成者均爲少，則爲不可諱言之事。一九三三年所産之大麥較一九三二年者多七百五十萬噸，小麥多四百萬噸。</p>
<p>蘇俄之税制，現己改由實物微納，有惠於人民者非淺。更以蘇俄領導之人才，均能克盡其職，努力謀改進之方，無怪其國勞之突飛猛進也。</p>

<h3 id="c227">詩人的運命 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>在詩人朱湘自殺後不久，我得到了法國詩王保羅·佛爾（PaulFort）生活困難的消息。這位一出生了三十餘部詩集的天才詩人，在六十多歲的晚年，不特病，而且窮，眞令人感到非常難過。</p>
<p>「我是一棵詩歌的樹」，保羅·佛爾在他自，的詩裏，曾這樣説過。他於詩歌有獨特的天才。他的多産的詩作曾經獲得相當廣泛的讀者。也許是世界經濟恐慌的原故，或是時代改變的原故罷，詩王保羅，佛爾竟也得到如此艱窘的晚運。保羅·佛爾尚且如此，其他詩人更不問可知了。</p>
<p>詩人的運命都應當如此麽？我不禁要問。同時又想起詩人的自殺來了。自然，慢性自殺和「他殺」的，不算。查鐵敦（Chtterton）諾爾瓦爾（G·deNeval），葉賢甯（Yssenine）馬雅柯夫斯基（Mayakovski）北村透谷，生田春月，王國維，朱湘等都是自殺而死的。此外許多詩人也是什九終生窮苦。詩人的運命，爲什麽都是如此呢！</p>
<p>社會要人歌功頌德，可是詩人大都身無媚骨。社會要人同流合污，可是詩人大都清高不苛。這樣，自然要獲得他們的「窮」的運命了。</p>
<p>兎死狐悲，物傷其類，聽説日本詩人掘口大學日前出版了「保羅·佛爾詩抄」，擬將板税寄呈原作者。這種國際的友情，不知對於保羅·佛爾的經濟上，能有多大的帮助？</p>
<p>從詩人保羅·佛爾，我又想到早些時候遊華的同國小説家迭科抱拉來。一本「睡車裏的聖處女」就得到二百萬法郎的收入。看來還是作丑脚，作賣藝的，可以有好的生活！</p>
<h3 id="c228">希望 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>

<p>年年在天涯海角飄蕩，可是那兒有一綫希望？</p>
<p>莫不是擺在天上，經狂風揭起，</p>
<p>裊裊地，像傍晚的炊烟，</p>
<p>飄到了無何有之鄉？</p>
<p>莫不是印在冰上，</p>
<p>經烈日晒融，</p>
<p>悠悠地，像暮春的落花，</p>
<p>飄到了重洋中埋葬？</p>
<p>啊！我爲着尋求一綫希望！</p>
<p>年年在天涯海角飄蕩~</p>

<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>在一條兩傍是墳堆的柏油馬路上，看見我的朋友杉。</p>
<p>「怎麽」，杉先招呼我，「不認識我？」</p>
<p>怎麽會不認識呢，杉的樣子還是那副神氣，只是那華貴的新裝使我有些囁嚅了。我們握了握手，杉的手是温潤的，油滑的，而且豐澤的。那白襯衫的袖口是雪白雪白的。</p>
<p>「你不是在XX工作嗎</p>
<p>？」我低着頭看我的枯乾的，滿是皺紋的，粗糙的手掌。</p>
<p>「什麽工作？」他笑着，「我是早己不「工作」了，現在正在練習抱孩子，哈哈哈……」</p>
<p>他呌我到他家去，看看他們的小動物。一邊走，一邊笑，小動物長小動物短地和我談起來。我莫明其妙了半天，最後明白了，「哦，他説的是他的孩子！」</p>
<p>到了杉的家，琦穿着全黑的衣裳，抱着一個滿身天鵝絨的小娃子，站在那裏。我奇怪，「那陣風把琦吹到這裏，這精明女人和杉又是玩着什麽把戲！這女子據説在XX……」　　杉笑着，跑上前把娃子接過來，並且説，「你連琦也不認識了！」便又把笑臉對琦説，「他在路上也不認識我呢！」</p>
<p>女人銀鈴似的笑着，擺動她那修長的纎腰。</p>
<p>「看我們的小動物好不好？」她説。</p>
<p>哦，我明白了，她們是兩口兒啊。</p>
<p>小動物有靈活的黑眼睛，看見生人嚇哭了，兩口子忙忙地撫慰孩子，不理我，我立在一旁，心想從前我們在一條綫上，我認識你，你認識我，現在你在綫上，我在綫下，我還怎敢高攀呢？</p>
<p>「你們的小動物眞好，眞好，眞好，眞好！」</p>
<p>我接連着説完一串「眞好」，便託故走了。</p>
<h3 id="c230">答何家槐誣害的自由（續） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 徐轉蓬</p>
<p>其次談到我們的文章糾紛，他説「轉蓬一口咬定我拿了他的文章而未得他的允許，誠不知他的用心何在」？而我説，除掉車水一篇在事前是得了我的允許之外，其他全部都未得我允許的。我的罪過只是在他既改名發表以後，而不與之理論這一點而己。他説我的「出獄」是我自己和朋友不滿意的東西。我寫的東西，可以説没有一篇是自己滿意的，可是這大家都不滿意的作品，換了個名字，增改了三百字左右，發表出來，就成爲他得意的「傑作」了。試問，有没有一篇壞透了的作品，而只修改了三百多個字，就成了一篇「傑作」的奇蹟呢？</p>
<p>凡是我托家槐介紹的文章，他總是説「這文章寫得不好」！最初我還不敢有惡意的疑心，現在看來，原是先説不好，灰了我的心，而他拿去發表，就振振有詞了。</p>
<p>當侍桁尚未將此事揭穿以前，曾由趙家璧君和侍桁雙方調解，欲將此事暗中解决，而家槐對趙君否認此事，先説他有些小説只不過取了我的計劃而己。後來又説我的文章是經他修改過的，而且修改了很多很多，我聽到這話，只是一笑置之絶想不倒他會有臉寫在紙上。</p>
<p>除去我最初的一兩篇小説，他增改的較多之外，其餘不過是字句的調換，而這字句的調換也是爲了掩飾二人間文筆的不同而己。下面我也開了個清單。</p>
<p>（一）牙痛丨這是我最初寫的一篇作品，本是極　，他也的確增加了很多，但也絶不像他所説由兩千字加到六千字之多，我的原稿约在三四千字，不過這篇作品大家可以找來看看，現在還是壞得一榻糊塗的東西。</p>
<p>（二）一個兵士的妻子丨我本把這文章送新月的那時編者是邵洵美先生，稿子看了説可用，但新月擱了二月未出版，我寫信去索回，他回説失落了。那時家槐正在新月書店編輯部做校對，就請他去查，回答説找不着。但經過了個暑期，回上海看到文藝月刋，却見到署他的名字發表了，以後見面時怕家槐臉紅便不提起。原文長六七千字，被他拉長八千多字。</p>
<p>（三）第六産丨他説「我曾將轉蓬原稿署上我的名字摘投寄東方。」此稿我原是托他介紹東方去的，但他在我的原稿上第一次便改了他的名字寄去。這秘密事前我是未曾知道的，只發表了後，又看見變了家槐的名字。他又説改了，但這篇可未提改到如何程度，增加多少字。以磨難編輯先生的事實便認定我的原作是不好的了</p>
<p>（四）漁家樂丨他説改了三次，我却不知他如何改法的。據我查看，只是堆砌了一點描寫而己，增加千字左右恐怕是有的。</p>
<p>（五）車水丨這篇文章事曾得了我的同意，因爲現代一連退了他一次稿，他似乎忿懑的告訴我，同時在我的抽屜里發現了剛寫成的車水，看了執着要拿去，並向我訴説自己寫不出作品的苦衷，我就答應他了。這原稿我還保留着，他只不過增加了幾百字　　。</p>
<p>（六）山谷之夜丨有的一句中有一二個，或有的一行中有一句半句，是他改過的，但改得很少很少，這是一篇我自己稍認爲滿意的作品，十分喜悦的請他介紹文藝月刋去，但經過好久的期待，作品刋出又變了名。</p>
<p>（七）出獄丨當我寫好了這篇文章，就十分高興的送給他看，他看了摇頭説不好，但後來在文學上刋出，却在他的文章中稱爲自己滿意的作品了。他説「改的時候雖不及通知他，可是在發表前，我曾寫信告訴他。一這是造謡的。這篇他所加上的字，没有一百個。</p>
<p>（八）賭塲丨他説修改了三千字光景，據我所查，却不到六百字。</p>
<p>其他瞎子婦人，晚餐，娱樂三篇，一字未改。他對於我的文章有些删改，一月前在我給現代編者的信中，早經聲明的。我并不想把他改過的文章收爲己有，如果把文章收回來，我仍是要照自己的筆法，自己的原樣子改過來的。我自己的文章，當然我能够辨得出那些地方是他改過的。</p>
<p>近日輿論界，很有些人説我得鉽平分，」這點家槐的自白里也瞒過去了。我文章被他拿去，署他的名字，他用稿費，至今還問我用心何在？</p>
<p>家槐在自白里説要走上堅實的「新生」的路，這話誰聽來都會喜歡。但我希望他「新生」以前，多洗幾次身，洗了一切卑鄙陰險的行爲，不然如個猴子穿了人的衣服，在「新生」路上走着，也是不太光榮的事哩！（完）</p>

<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>（四）溜躂雜記</p>
<p>北平人所謂的「溜躂溜躂」，實在就是散步的意思，上海話稱爲「蕩馬路」者近似。但有時「溜躂」的涵義又似乎不止「蕩馬路」而兼有「白相」的暗示，此則非老於「溜躂」者不能言之也。</p>
<p>從東單牌樓西向溜躂到東長安門，是一條平直空闊的大道丨東長安街丨比上海愛多亞路還要寛得多。沿街的北面是一帶緑森森的樹林，掩蔽着高高低低的洋樓，那都是洋式的旅館，在禁止跳舞之前是車水馬龍的去處。街南是各國駐軍的操場，連綿地啣接着，外邊有木欄和鐵絲圈着，禁止閑人進去。操塲的地基比東長安街高出一尺光景，大概是時常塡土加高的緣故。沿操塲的南邊是使館和軍營的厚傅牆，牆上都是蜂窠似的槍眼，據説是一九００年義和團事件之後築的，以防華人的「叛亂」！</p>
<p>再向西溜躂過去，穿過東長安門，就是舊皇城的正面。兩根白石雕龍的華表矗立在兩旁，五條白石雕欄的「五龍橋」跨空地臥着。過橋就是高巍巍的天安門城樓，頳紅色的城牆，牆上五座環門迎着五龍橋，構成一個壯麗威嚴的景色。不過細看時城樓上的欄櫺己被風雨剥蝕，假使登樓一看想必厚積着灰塵和蛛蝄罷！城牆上塗的頳紅色的灰土也罩上了一層蒼黑，東一搭西一搭的剥落處露出磗塊；五龍橋雕欄也顯着頽喪的景象，橋面石板縫都長着草。兩根華表有石欄圍護着，比較是最完整的，然而西邊的一根在近頂處己有一條裂痕了！</p>
<p>從天安門口進去向北，就是所謂的紫禁城，若向南溜躂去則可以一直到前門。但無論向北向南，在眼前展開的只是一種頽廢的景象。所看見的東西！甚至脚下踏着的一塊破石板丨都能告訴你牠從前的偉大；唯其知道牠從前的偉大，所以更覺得牠現在没落得可哀。不錯，北平的一切都在没落！</p>
<p>循着原路溜躂回去，假使是在夜裏，你就會遇見幾輛專在車單牌樓一帶拉生意的洋車。</p>
<p>「先生，拉您到東邊兒溜躂溜躂去吧。有好的……俄國的……高麗的……上海新來的……」</p>
<p>於是你又覺得連「溜跶躂」也没落了</p>

<p>三志在益人。紹介文化，翻譯作品，好像做生意。但除了爲利益學術界思想界以外，不應有旁的志願。西歐的學術也廣大無邊，倘若於我們毫無用處的，即算於原文精通，譯文不錯，這工夫便等於白費。那麽，先應該：</p>
<p>甲：立定主張。「兄弟主張改良政治。」那麽，好吧，立定主張了。如要作翻譯工作，便釋譯政治之名著。使事業和主張不太懸殊。但不宜因爲某公这情面，而譯一本「烹飪新法」，或又因某公司之聘，釋譯一本「人造絲之研究」。因爲即使譯筆無誤，究竟也太費神。術語不同，表現方法也不同，難矣；白用去自己的時間與精力，如千里馬負塔車上太行，旁人也爲之生哀；何况將來説不定釋譯一本「凡爾賽條約之研究」或「國際公法」，在書坊舗子裏和「烹飪新法」之類並列，也頗覺不倫不類。頗聞許多留學生回國，隨便拿起小説之類便釋譯，是見其没有主張的。</p>
<p>乙：先定計劃。即有自己一貫的主張，必有一貫之路綫。不致今日譯「步兵操典」，明日譯「文藝復興」。計劃可以以時代爲中心，或思想爲中心先翻Ｘ，後譯Y，有一定之步驟。最好以現代中國讀者界爲前提。閣下之文筆太深奥，使人難于看懂；或譯出與咱們漠不相關之著作，如「四十年來巴黎之時裝變遷史」，或「倫敦大霧之研究」，美則美矣，其于中國何！「其于百姓何」！</p>
<p>大概志願立定了，本領又很高明，則此時有「怎麽翻」之一問題。以上三項，皆是説明「如何方够得上翻書」。以下幾點，是論怎麽翻譯，方可以事半功倍：一。莫翻英華字典，或法華字典之類丨丨翻書時用字典，最好原文原解的，現時洋文華解之字典，大致皆宜於初學洋文，而不宜於翻譯。有時思路滯塞，求在這種字典中尋啓發吧，便如煩躁的希望的異性的安慰，他或她使你更煩躁，冒火。那有詩做得好的抱住「佩文韻府」或「詩韻合璧」？</p>
<p>那有會翻書的不斷地從字典中取出一個個字補凑，編排？何况現存之洋華字典，大都糊塗得可以</p>
<h3 id="c233">遺書 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>「哦，同情！」一個尖鋭的戰慄剌透了她的心。</p>
<p>依娜决定要寫一封信給那些書於同情的人們。她從好她的手夾裏取出了一支筆和一塊手巾，便把這手夾從一個地方去換取了那要寫信的設備。</p>
<p>在國泰戲院的左近，她走進了一個精緻的咖啡間。她要了一杯咖啡，便開始寫着。　　一致善於同情的人們</p>
<p>「是的，我是一個弱者，可是我並不要你們的同情，更不要你們的憐憫。還有，要是你們想感慨的詁，請你們放鬆了這個弱者，而從别方面去找對象如何？</p>
<p>她還想寫幾句，可是想不出寫什麽。她在開信封，收信者是席卓雲。她也想寫一封信給他，告訴他這是她的最後的投搞，請他最好能不遲延地把它發表。可是她没有寫。别的她也没有寫，只在那標題下寫了她的名字。</p>
<p>咖啡己冷，她一口氣把它喝乾了，就到那最近的郵局把信掛號寄出了。</p>
<p>出了郵局的門，她向西走着。她在留心着那里的電車開得快一些。她一直走過了惠達飯店，停在法蘭西兵營前面。</p>
<p>看到一輛最漂亮的二路電車在捷駛過來，她便奔過去向前扑倒在軌道上。</p>
<p>無疑的，當那封信還没被遞邮出去的時候，依娜己進了另一個世界，而使那信變成了一封遺書。（完）</p>

<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>中國在列强環伺之下，正像是一塊肥肉，大家都向之垂涎。今天甲國妄想來挖一洞，明日乙國企圖來咬幾口，到現在，其所以僥倖尚以苟延殘喘者，並非自身有任何抵抗力，倒是他們野心家分割未平之賜。然而就是這樣聽人零零片片生吞活剥下去，恐怕有一天也總會給吃盡呢！</p>
<p>我們看，外蒙早就宣告獨立了，東北己非我有，内蒙剛閙着要求自治，西藏新疆也接着不斷地傅來警訊。凡這種種不幸事件之暴發，無一不有野心家在背後慫恿唆使，播弄鬼計陰謀。他們爲防火併起見，好像在暗地就妥恊定當，彼此狼狽爲奸，默認某地爲某國的勢力範圍，某處是某人的活動界域。這一來，各國便可以各自由自在地於其所謂勢力範圍或活動界域，横衝直撞，爲所欲爲。只要不阻礙他國的利權，誰也不會出來干涉。不但如此，他們有時自己踐踏滿意了，反要做做人情，討好歡心，嗾使别人來行侵略，那才可惡而復可恨！下列一段新聞，就是日本陰謀的大暴露。</p>
<p>莫斯科此間報載，土耳其舊王子阿布杜凱爾列姆，己自上海動身赴新疆，凱氏於數月前，自東京赴上海，匿居某租界上，彼爲日本之傀儡，且爲新疆獨立國王位之候補者，現時日本若干軍界，正與土耳其流亡人員合作，竭力拉攏軍事及宣傅幹部，以促成新疆獨立國之實現，根據該項報告，凱氏之離上海，即欲親自主持該項工作，蓋此工作己有相當成就云，（二十三日塔斯電）</p>
<p>我人讀完此警耗，覺日人之野心，非常可畏。他們自威迫我國訂立二十一條件以後，對付我國的手段，無所不用其極。九一八慘變，且伸一巨掌，强攫我四省土地，成立其所謂滿洲國。我人以爲他們既獲得此「生命線」，多年妄求之慾望，一旦如願以償，從此或可稍弭其侵略之野心。誰知敵人貪慾無饜，得寸進尺，前有組織華北國之企圖，現又有嗾使士前王子赴新建立獨立國之陰謀，其處心積慮，亦毒矣哉！此電是否可靠，雖尚未能證實，但當此新疆糾紛未解之時，我國亦不應漠然視之。願我政府及人民深切注意之，勿使野心家得達其非分之目的，而蒙莫大之損失與禍害！</p>

<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>朋友們有意無意的問我近來爲什麽不寫稿。因爲我是個寫稿過活的人，忽然停起筆來在他們多少覺得是驚奇的事，自然他們不好意思問我近來不吃飯吧？不過這問句的話氣，好像還含有探聽我秘密似的。自從去年偶然寫了幾個戀愛的故事，在朋友們多了許多談話資料，年青人談起戀愛當然精神抖擻的，尤其喜探聽人家的秘密。其實我是個安分守己的年青人，對於戀愛己不能引起我的興趣，雖然認識了菲姑娘以後，多少摇動了我的心，但是她己到南國去了。我們無意的認識，也那樣作爲無意的分手了。然而我的罪狀好像因此成立，一個寫戀愛故事的年青人，他一定在戀愛着，於是我被朋友們懷疑了，所以我想從此再不寫那樣的文章。定了這樣的主意，我每天東遊西蕩，藉此休養我一年來底勞頓，然後好好地努力起來寫稿。然而不寫稿也能使朋友們不信任我，近來問我不寫稿原因的朋友，都接間一句忙些什麽事呢？顯然他以爲不寫稿的原因是被某一件事牽制着，而某一件事就是他們要探聽的秘密。套一句老調，無巧不成書，有一位朋友來訪我三次，上門不見土地，昨天在電影院裏遇見了。我適巧和一位我僅見過一次而忘了尊姓大名的女士在一起，（其實這一類不謀而合的尶𡯓事在每個人或者遇見過的）他好像人贓並獲似的責問起來。我覺得眞無聊，在那樣的塲合。同時對那位不知姓氏的女士，覺得十分抱歉，在本人莫名其妙的時候被人取笑。</p>
<p>中國人的天性是喜歡管閒事。往往吃飽了自家的飯，管人家的閒賬。東家的小姐不規矩，西家的媳婦兒偷漢，像他都與份似的可以從頭到底説一個暢快。尤其對於這類被人認爲秘密的醜事，可以加油加醬的動人聽聞。在説的人果然滿足了他破壞的慾望，但管閒事也要預防閒事被管的時候，恐怕也不樂意人家對他那樣做吧？再説到和一個女朋友在一起瞧電影，我認爲是無足驚奇，雖然電影院在上海並不是個好去處。</p>
<p>我被管閒事的人從故鄉管到上海來，使我永遠不能回到咫尺在望的老窠去，我的命運似乎就主宰在管閒事的手裏，所以我痛恨管閒事，一如人家喜歡管閒事一樣。</p>
<p>不過話要説回來，那朋友不見得存心來管我的閒事，他吃的是和我一樣的白米飯，况且他本人的閒事也被管在人家手中。開開玩笑在朋友間誠然可以的，代做義務廣告却承情不至呢！這樣或在要得罪我的朋友，但不是我的希望；我要寫稿了，特此通告，我並没有類乎秘密的事牽制着。</p>

<p>— 列火</p>
<p>死，本是常事；可是笏死了，難然己有了三年的長時間，却還很緊迫地壓在我的心頭。我不能遺忘他，他的影子永遠在我的眼前晃動，爲的是他的死太悽慘！爲的是他的死太寃枉！可是他又並非死於鬩墻的内戰裏，也並非死於莫須靠的嫌欵犯的槍决下，更非死於經濟的壓迫，以及什麽失戀自殺。</p>
<p>他是的的確確病死的。</p>
<p>放大點説，他是死是封建勢力，直接掌劊手的是他的父母；然而他的父母又確是最疼愛着他，——視如一顆掌上的寳珠。所以雖然結束了他的兒子的性命，却又爲着死了笏幾幾乎瘋狂了。</p>
<p>這是矛盾的事，更是矛盾的死呵！</p>
<p>假使人類的資質是果有「天才」的話，那麽我眞要溢笏是一個天才的孩子，他在我的童年的朋友中是最傑出不凡的一個了。十一年以前同在一個私塾裏念書，所讀的是什麽昭明文選，資治通鑑，他都能背誦如流，那時他還僅僅十二歲。以後同進高小，他的功課又總比别人底的弄得熟練些，雖非每次考試的結果，他的名字遠落在我們的後頭。</p>
<p>講體質，他的先天的身體，丨丨父母傅送給他的一付骨骼，雖不怎樣的强壯，但也不弱於一般的孩子，比起我來恐怕還要略勝一籌。</p>
<p>當我們在高小畢業的時候，他還僅僅十五歲，照生理學講，正是青春發育的旺盛時期，他果也成長得很快。有一次他告訴我説：「我快結婚了，大概在赴省升學之前」！自然，那時的我，也同樣是「老鼠迎光」，看不到早婚是有害的；而且我們的故鄉，早婚己成了一般的風氣，只要家裏有口飯吃，十三四歲的尚有「乳臭」的孩子就結起婚來，而娶進的却是二十來歲的少女。所以我當時聽了他的説話，不但不加非議，而且意下有些傾慕。</p>
<p>豈知這就是笏早死　根蒂。</p>
<p>到C城去升學，我們是　校了，爲了彼此相隔很遠，爲了彼此都算還用功求學，我們是不常見面了，只有時在一些妳動的朋友中口得着他一些消息丨不是他時常害病，而且説是害的肺病。於是我爲他耽心，爲他估計人生的旅程。假期回家的時候，更向他忠告丨丨不要給妻了害了，「遠色」是療病的唯一聖丹一類的話，可不知他曾接受過我的忠告没有？</p>
<p>十七年同伴來上海，目的是投考現己停辦的X官費學校，他的妻子也要跟他一道來，他自己固然是願意，他的父母也不加阻止，做朋友的勸阻，當然是如「耳邊風」，毫不發生作用的。不幸得很，他竟没有考取，受了一番晦氣，又每天和妻子混在一塊。這時他除了染了家鄉的封建餘毒，更加上了一層都市的「羅曼」誘惑，於是他的身體不能支持了，於是他回故鄉去了。</p>
<p>十八年春間他來信告訴我兩個消息丨丨一是説元配的妻子因小産逝世了，一是説又娶進了一位「尚稱適意」的繼配。糟了，我只有爲他加深一層憂慮，但我没有話説，爲的是説也没有效力。他的父母都是那樣蒙昧呢。</p>
<p>二十年暑間我回到鄉下去，特地去望望他，己是一具死神这前的屍骸了，肚子脹大得像「科斗」的肚，面慘白地，與之交談，只中脱口嗚咽，他的父母坐在他的旁邊，代他細述着幾年來的經過，一把眼涙，一把鼻涕。</p>
<p>一星期後，他的死耗傅進了我的耳鼓。</p>
<p>笏就是這樣的死去了，眞死得悽慘！眞死得先寃枉了然而在我們的故鄉，以至廣大的閉塞的内地，蒙受着封建餘毒，率性早婚，以致這樣悽慘寃枉死掉的青年正多着呵！</p>

<p>（北平訊：選舉皇后一幕丨丨由女生二百餘人參加競選，列隊游行，首次挑出三十餘人，第二次複選得五人：最後於裁判員愼審斟酌評判之下，「健康皇后」之寳座，由醫預二年級生「吴XX」女生獲得，全塲歡呼，體育部且贈鮮花以示奬勵……）</p>
<p>本來，這年頭兒似乎有些「向後轉了，復古似的會閙起「皇后之風」來。</p>
<p>過去的，有電影皇，學校皇后，花國皇后，以及……其他纏夾不清的各色各類的皇后。在這「有攷必有弊」的環境中，選舉皇后自亦難免有弊，也許例外會没有，恕我過甚其辭了。</p>
<p>總之，弊之有無係另一問題，能登得皇后寳座者，自當有其特長之處，至少，下例兩則，總得中其一耳丨丨</p>
<p>（一）體態輕盈，面目姣好。</p>
<p>（二）善辭利令，舉止輕佻。</p>
<p>眞的，像這類的人物，咱可似猴兒戲般的司空見惯了，概括一句話，受選者不過抱「出風頭主義」。罷了，而選舉者，雖未敢「别有所圖」，至少，是「别有用心」了！試問一個老婆子會有當選皇后的資格麽？</p>
<p>職是之故，報紙披露出她們的大名，以及商業化遊閒式的文字來，在我，只當是社會裏又多了一尊值價的，起特的，貴重的花瓶罷了！</p>
<p>現今，「吴XX」小姐當選了皇后了，因爲是「健康皇后」，咱想較其他皇后總究有見地有意義的多了；至少，吴小姐是負着「健康榜樣」的使命了，能吸引中國女子往健康路上跑，較專與男生談戀愛，胡閙的「學府皇后」，或是浪漫的，給人家剪開幕禮帶子的「電影皇后」要勝步得多了。</p>
<p>末了，我希望這是一個誠實的選舉，不附帶一點作用！那麽，「健康皇后」眞是值得稱道的了！</p>
<p>不知人家怎樣，我總以爲「皇后」二字太俗劣了，似乎太復古了一點，也許是「物極必反」的緣故，誰都想嚐嚐古來的風味，實際的風味嚐不到，掛一張古牌也算過得一個小瘾了。像生在這個年頭兒一樣，聽得老人家説：古代怎樣怎樣的好，雖未目見，心頭也就藴藏着能否再能過到像老人所説的古代的那樣的在平世紀，喫兩年太平飯；然而，祇有像掛「皇后古牌」一樣的在夢中去過瘾了，也許有，這豈是人力所有逆料的事？　　胡説了一陣，不知願做「皇后」的人，是否有着這樣一個同一的意思，這到是一個很有趣味的值得研究的一個問題呢！</p>

<p>— 胡塗</p>
<p>睛朗的天空，吹拂着一陣陣帶着微寒的風，普照着一片金黃色的陽光，路旁的樹枝，己抽出淡緑的嫩芽；柳條兒，隨着微風，摇擺着婀娜的姿態。從腦的深處，深深地意識到：春到人間了！　　於是，懷着一腔赤熱的心情，眞誠的，懇摯的。走到那處女似静美的兆豐公園，來造訪春之神的蹤跡了。</p>
<p>誠然，春是可愛的；但是，尤以這修飾得整齊，清潔的公園裏，青青的草地，葱葱的樹蔭，碧清的小池疉疉的假山，……一切都覺是值得戀慕的了。</p>
<p>走到魚池前，一片青緑色的草地上，坐着一羣孩子們，活潑潑地，多麽天</p>
<p>眞，多麽可愛，看見了他們手裏拿着的小旗，方知是由學校中的師長，領導着出來玩的。他們在這大自然的懷裏，一</p>
<p>頭吃着食物，一頭説笑着，打閙着，像是一羣放蹤的馬，又像一羣馴順的羔羊，在師長的領導下，一同遊嬉着，多快樂啊！</p>
<p>回憶起從前時候，在小學時代，還不是跟他們一樣快樂！逍遥嗎！然而，年華幾度，黃金時代的甜夢，再也不會回來了。這時，一種戀慕的情緒，眞是形容不出呢！我恨不得加入他們的陣伍，跟他們一同説笑，一同遊玩才好，終於，我是提起了嗓子，高喊着；小朋友！我來加入你們的陣伍好嗎？小朋友！讓我也來加入你們的陣伍好嗎？可是他們誰也没有來理會你。幾次我曾這樣高喊着，可是他們誰也没有來理會你。他們吃好了，坐了一會兒，打草地上爬了起來，排成長長一隊，往外面去了。</p>
<p>啊！一顆被擯棄了的，失去了童貞的心靈，站在孩子們的陣伍外，躑躅着，徘徊着，内心是滿含了悲哀，苦痛。涙，一滴滴，從眼眶裏流下來，流濕了衣襟，可是我没有覺得。我只深沈的感着：「而今只得站在孩子們的陣伍外了！」</p>
<h3 id="c240">血統太近不宜結婚的問題 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 緑莎</p>
<p>近親結婚對於子孫有不良的影響，這是近來多數學者所盛唱的，如聾，啞，畸形，白痴，色素性綱膜炎，體質嫩弱等，多見於血統太近的結婚者所生的子孫，學者們早有了不少的報告。但我以爲他們是絶對没有科學根據的，何以呢？如果近親結婚，對於子孫的影響，有這樣利害的話，那在古代的人們，向來是有近新結婚習慣的，他們的子孫不是都很衰弱了嗎？可是事實告訴我們，並不如是，丨丨在埃及波斯等往古的時，貴族間都是近親結婚的，如埃及的女王哥列渦巴托娜爲世間有數的美人，就是同胞間結婚生下來的，她不但有强健的體質，且具有透澈伶俐的頭腦，能自由操十八國的方言，精通希臘的文學，哲學，即在當時的碩學者，亦覺膛乎其後。再現代的日本也還盛行着近親結婚丨丨尤其是皇族間，難道他們都是低能，白痴，畸形的嗎？</p>
<p>可是話又説回來啦，爲什麽近親結婚爲從來學者們所非難呢？那全是基於傅説的緣故，原來吾人身體及精神的性質，即疾病的素因，素質，也能遺傅給子孫，在父祖同一血統的結婚者，其血統間存在的特殊性，是善，是惡，其子孫所承受的影響，愈益濃厚，所以，如其血族間是强健的，則近親的結婚，對於子孫是有利的。反之，血族間仍遺傅性疾患者，或爲病弱者，則血族間的結婚，對於子孫是有害的。但是，再進一步説：身心都健全的血族，事實上是少有的，故血族間累代相婚，其子孫當然難免受着遺傅上的影響；除去體格强健，絶無遺傅體質的血族又當别論外，還是以避免近親結婚爲得第。要之，聾啞，白痴，衰弱，决非近親結婚的原因；從遺傅説的原則講起來，乃是血族中特殊遺傅的缺陷加倍傅及子孫的影響，那些近親結婚，直接血液變惡，以及成爲種種疾病原因諸説，我們絶對不能相信。</p>
<p>總之，近親結婚，没有上述諸項病症，是没有害的。但是，若累代的血族相婚，那也爲給子孫以不利的。</p>

<p>— 文里</p>
<p>忙人喜歡小病休息身體的疲勞，我這不忙的人如今也來小病，那是正如生在多子的人家的孩子只令人覺得討厭。一連病了幾天，悶在家裏看書不成寫作更不容許，終日望着白壁在難受。在難受中，我也曾幻想過許多美麗的白日之夢，其故事的中心思想就是：如果有一天給我不用寫作而有飯吃，無論什麽職業都好。有如置身於銀幕裏頭，忽爲教書先生，在向學生講文學概論，忽爲報裏的書記，在抄寫文件，忽爲商店裏的賬房，在記賬寫信，……儼然自己是成了一個非失業的人，多麽驕傲呵！可是，同時又聯想到假如小病變成大病，到那時將如何是好呢，想到這裏，那一天到紅十字會看一個朋友的病的情狀，立刻在我的腦膜上有如銀幕的放映電影一樣的，一幕一幕開演了。十幾張病床都淌着在呻吟的病人的三等房間，跟鏡頭：從遠而近，到了我那朋友的床前。特寫：朋友的枯黃灰白無血色的面孔，眼睛不大睁得開，説話的時候動着兩片枯焦的嘴唇兒都不大有务量。字幕：「病了個把月，錢也化不少，病還一點没起色！現在錢是没有了，欠了醫院的賬，你看我怎麽辦呢？」我和他才講了幾句話，回頭看見看護婦來了，她不准病人談話。特寫：看護婦的憤怒的面孔，睁着眼睛對病人駡。字幕：「不准你説話，醫生吩咐的，老是不聽！以後不給人家來看你了！」説着望我一眼，説明他的病是不能説話的。字幕：「你們來看病的，應該不要他説話。」説着扭一扭柳腰走了。我心裏想：怎麽這樣的盛氣來對付一個病人呢，和氣一點不是更好嗎？回想，近景：在一間頭等病房裏頭，也是我這人去看那裏的一個病的朋友，進來了一個看護婦，和氣地笑瞇瞇地對病人説話，字幕：「X先生，你要聽話才好喲，醫生吩咐過不給你多説話，你怎麽朋友一來，就説了那麽多？以後不要，啊，啊，聽我的話。」病人一聽心裏快樂答應她以後不要多説話，而我看見也佩服恏對於職務眞是盡心。回來再是那三等病房，近景：我看那病的朋友，受了看護婦的氣，望了我一眼。説「欠了賬的病人，許多是要受氣的，唉！一（字樣）特寫：我那朋友的面孔上，眼涙從眼眶裏汪汪地挣下來。……想起了那病房，我打了一個寒噤。心裏在祈禱着：但願不要大病。</p>

<p>— 齊速</p>
<p>「龍生龍，鳳生鳳，賊養兒子掘壁洞」。這是句俗話：意思是説：皇帝的少爺，一定是太子，大老板的兒子，不會不是「小開」，而窮人生出來的，當然，一定是「小　三」了。可是，事實告訴我們：桀紂都曾做過皇帝的兒子：宣統皇帝的爸爸，也未始不是滿清的嫡系：况且，到鄭家木橋去找一個眞眞的小　三問問，却也有許多，以前曾喧嘩過一時的。而反過來説，現在一輩坐汽車，吃大菜的所謂「大亨」者們的出身，倒不見得都可以大書特書。因此，這一句俗話的理論，在一般聰敏人的嘴裏，不很聽見吐出來了。</p>
<p>倒是常常聽見談起，狗的種是不能混的，一混就變壞：還有鴿子的種也非常考究。而强者的兒子，身體比較終要健些。這原是有關於先天，當然是鐵也似的理論。不過，以前有人論某女士之所以能以短跑在全國運動會裏大出風頭者，是因爲她的祖先，爲了商業的關係，一年要從關内跑到關外，徒步幾次，練就了强健的原素，以遺傅給了她的緣故，這倒有些令人不解了。因爲我們相信「環境」，是一個人失敗與成功的最大原因。譬如説，某女士自小即被父母束之高閣，做了一個十足的黃花閨女，她有没有以短跑成名的可能呢？或者，某女士生到了一個窮人家去，終日的光陰，被淘米，洗菜，抱小孩消磨了，没有福氣到學校裏讀書，不曾懂得短跑的起步，她會不會在運動會中出風頭呢？社會上的種種關係，即所謂環境，决定了一切，誰也不能駕起祥雲，兩脚離地的。</p>
<p>又有人以爲，除了强健的體格外，卓越的精神，高尚的人格，隆重的道德　也都有遺傅性的。因而提議，設法使高尚的人，多留些後代，而對於一切卑鄙，下流，愚庸者們的養兒子加以注意，俾將來的社會上，都是善種，再也没有惡事發生。</p>
<p>但這也同樣是不通的理論。社會中的生産關係，即經濟的條件，决定了一切。理性和意志，是不能左右人一絲一毫的。一個有名的科學者，爲了肚子的問題，他會製造殺人的利器，一個德通隆重的傅教者，爲了要舒適的話，也可以替狡猾的狐狸，欺騙山羊。經濟的鐵圈，支配着在這圈裏的人。一些也不會有例外，一些也不會有偶然的。</p>
<p>無論誰，假使眞的憂心於「世道」，而欲加以補救的話，則只有掮起掃帚，把這個環境打掃一下。不必須，駕起祥雲，勝在空中，學什麽齊天大聖的妙法也。</p>

<p>— 建設</p>
<p>精神頽廢，成了一般青年的通病，很流行的統治着每個的思想和行爲。所以我認爲這是一個值得討論的問題，因爲它是這麽關切着我們。</p>
<p>爲什麽我們的精神會頽廢呢？有些人以爲是由於身體的病弱和先天的遺傅，於是便展開着説：精神的振或頽，是由於身體的强或弱，比如體力之於身體，身體强的人，體力就大，身體弱的體力就小。精神也就是這樣，身體强的人精神就振作，身體弱的精神就頽廢。於是更進一步解釋身體弱的原因，第一是由於疾病，第二是先天的遺傅。所以結論便是若要精神不頽廢，祇有先弄强身體。</p>
<p>這，我的意見不同。固然，身體的强弱能予精神以相當的影響。但若就青年頽廢的現象中細細地去觀察，則我覺得「認識」這一點，倒是它中間最重要的因子。許多事的盲昧，錯誤，和由盲昧錯誤所引出來的許多不幸的事情，大概都因爲認識不澈底的原故。原始人的崇拜自然，中世紀人的拜倒神像，……都是由於不認識這事物的眞象。我們知道，所謂認識者，便是憑着淵博的學問，深遠的眼光，縝密的思考力去對某一個事物分析和觀察。分析得越清楚，觀察得越深到，就越盡着認識的能事。能以認識爲工具，我們才可揭開一切事物，一切現象的蒙蔽物：我們才可以貼近那事件的眞實面。</p>
<p>我們分析青年精神頽廢的現象。覺得並非由於身體的病弱，也不是先天的遺傅：而是因爲：「愛情」，「職業」和「思想」這三個問題不能解决的原故，在這三者之中，尤以思想問題爲最重。只要獨犯着這三個問題之一，就可使某個青年頽廢下去，就可使一個活生生的漢子，平地成爲淒凉的消沈人。要想避免這種頽廢的命運，就不能不同這現社會找出它的根本動力來。現在的社會，無疑的是一個充滿着矛盾和黑暗的社會，在這社會中，金錢成了人類的無上主宰者，這主宰者它派生着許多制度，察警，軍備，法規等等，壓服着我們，使我們男女青年即管有了熱情，也找不着愛者，即管有了愛者，也不能結合；使我們賤價出賣着自己，却又時時遭着失業的厄運：結果便使我們覺得這世界充滿了黑暗，而使我們好像失了指引者一樣，不住的徬徨和動摇起來。</p>
<p>一個這樣的世界，假使我們不有一種深遠的眼光，認識這目前雖然充斥着予盾，充斥着黑暗，可是這祇不過一種舊社會制度發展到它的最高度，發展到即要崩潰了的前夕的必然現象。則我們即很容易被這黑暗面所恫脅，所控制，結果便使我們灰頽喪敗起來。所以這其間，祇是一個認識與不認識的問題，而不是别的。</p>
<p>假使我們能够對現社會眞有明確的了解，則我們即可知道，愛情的遭受狙擊，智力和體力的遭受無代價的榨壓，都是由於不合理的惡劣社會制度使然。假使我們進一步由史的考察知道這社會不是固定而是進化的，知道一個社會制度發展到一定的階段，它便不能不崩潰，則我們就不但可以知道我們的痛苦失望慘敗的原因，並且我們决定我們自己的思想，使我們在這時代的潮流激盪的當前，知道我們應當趨向於那一方，而不致使自己成爲一個没有出路，没有前途的落伍者。</p>
<p>怎樣能够做到這些呢？都是由於我們對現實的認識呵。</p>
<p>所以我覺得身體的强弱不是以决定我們頽廢不頽廢的命運：反之認識不認識倒是决定它的根本的原因。所以我覺得要想把我們青年的頽廢問題掃蕩净盡，祇有從認識上多做工夫。</p>

<p>（引言）</p>
<p>我去暹羅，是在一九二九年的冬天那時候，上海是己經下過雪了。我在寒風裏攢進了太古公司的南華班，冷得只是在被窠中發抖，船過臺灣洋面，天氣就漸漸和暖起來，等到第天三在汕頭上陸，旅客們己都脱去冬服，穿起那輕快的秋裝。我是從未到過南方的，覺得相隔不過三天，氣候竟會如此不同。當時我彷佛像一個没有見過世面的鄉下人，一旦走進繁華的都市裏一樣的驚奇與贊嘆！</p>
<p>巧得很，那天剛剛有暹羅班出口。我在汕頭僅僅停留了數小時，又度那長途的海上生活了。由汕至暹，普通是一星期的航程，但遇到風浪大的時候，那就非十天不成。我乘的是汕暹班各輪中比較迅速的一艘，所以在船上只住了六天。起初一二天倒還不覺得怎樣，望得見安南山後，天就一刻一刻的熱起來。先是穿不住外衣，後來是脱去背心和長褲，待到最後的一二天，縱然是怕冷的我，也不得不跟着别人用冷水來澆身了。這在生長在熱帶的人看來，原來極平常的事，但在我，確是一個奇蹟！</p>
<p>現在，又是連朝風雪的嚴冬了。我裹着臃腫的寒衣，緊閉起門窗，還没有一絲暖意。於是，那長年如夏的暹羅，又喚起了我的回憶，這就是我寫這篇東西的動機。以下的這些論斷，是我們僑暹兩年餘的見聞，我想或者可以給一班關心暹羅華僑現狀的讀者，做一個可有可無的參考，並爲我自己留一個永久的印象。</p>

<p>— 廣道</p>
<p>嘉寳回到好萊塢，大抵己有一年多了吧。爲什麽她回美國、這件事大概到現在還有没有一個定議。最近在美國的SoreenPlay裏登載了一篇文字，叙述這位瑞典明星所以突然回到美國的原因。我因爲它富有興趣，並且因爲它是道人所未道，所以把它摘了一些，以饗閲者。</p>
<p>在葛雷泰嘉寳的至友中，他們都知道上次她的離開好萊塢，回到她瑞典的故土，她己有退休之志。並且她亦買了很大的别墅，頗有終老故鄉之意。美國雖係她成名致富之地，但在她熱烈的靈魂當中，她却最厭惡美國，而没有重返好萊塢之意。在瑞典鄉間的别墅裏，她可以得到閑静的安慰，她可以逃避一切古怪眼睛的獰視。那時她退休的意思，可説是堅决得很。米曲羅公司當局，當然對於此事，未有相當的了解。他們知道她没有意思重返銀幕，所以他們就偵騎四出，覓取她的替身。結果，他們尋到了一個俄國的歌舞女。她在銀幕上，没有經騐的，可是她富有異國情調以及誘惑的性格，頗有發展而代替嘉寳的可能性。因此，米曲羅當然竟毫不遲疑地，和她訂了合同，將她秘密地帶回了美國。</p>
<p>這位俄國的歌女是誰？她的名字呌凱絲琳寨加伐（KathrynSeava）</p>
<p>有黃色的頭髮和藍色的眼睛。她有一切俄國女子所特具的異鄉情調和光彩。她面容酷似嘉寳。在嘉寳返瑞典之後，米曲羅公司四出尋覓嘉寳替身的傅説，己是甚囂塵上。一般野心勃勃的女子，聽見了這個影后寳座，尚在虚懸之中，所以眉目的間，祇要有一些貌似，就生了覬觎之心。但是在這許多覬觎者之中，没有一個人像凱絲琳塞加伐，像嘉寳像得那樣近的。她方方的面盤，觀骨微露，那眼睛，鼻子嘴，無處不近似瑞典的嘉寳。有人看見了她，她那種走路的神情，竟有人誤會她就是嘉賓的。</p>
<p>米曲羅公司對於這位塞加伐女士，本來是有很大的計畫的。他們决計倘使葛雷泰嘉寳不回美國，他們就將這位塞加伐小姐掮出來，使她平地一聲雷的做了明星，好像高爾温將另外一位俄國新明星安娜斯登掮出來，一樣的奇特驚人。他們不願意將她浪用在小角色上，而讓她慢慢地一步一步地升到明星的地位。他們故意的將她掩蓋了，使外面絲毫不知，然後時期一到，就將她捧了出來，大大的鼓吹一下。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c247">評「雲裳艶曲」 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Fashionsof1934—南京—</p>
<p>自「四十二號街」「歌舞舁平」「華清春暖」等而後，一連的歌舞片，萬花繚亂的層出不窮。在這裏又有了這一部「雲裳艶曲」，很顯然的，又是一部美國之典型的歌舞片。</p>
<p>我們差不多不用懷疑的，美國電影藝術的表現方法，的確己是登峰造極了，也可以説，在好些美國影片中，我們很可以看出資本主義電影的最高形式。在歌舞片中，「歌無昇平」是如此，「華清春暖」是如此，現在這「雲裳艶曲」又是如此。最高度的形式主義的作品。</p>
<p>我們看過這一影片之後，我們不妨閉目静思一下；美國電影作家是在怎樣拚命耗費啊。當我們看到那一塲羽扇舞的時候，那以黃金鑲成的空虚的美，固然不足以使我們欣羡或陶醉，但是，那資本主義的浪費，到底不是我們所敢想像的罷，當然，在我們的電影中，决不需要那糜爛的豪華，可是我們得認識那便是資本主義電影的特徵了。</p>
<p>同樣，明快歡樂的調子，是美國電影新的特徵，而這些，在「雲裳艶曲」中，也是充分的一點也不涵蓄的展開着。就這一點來説，我們更可以看出導演者聰明活潑的手法。整個的是明快的律動。每一個笑料都是自然的，一點也不假借的發展，幾乎是没有一個塲面可以給與你有感覺沉悶的機會。自然，這對於疲乏了的市民們，會覺得十分溶洽。正因爲如此，導演能給與你們的如你們所要求的一樣，於是導演者在道一方面，的確是成功了。</p>
<p>紳士太太們，請你們盡情的快樂罷。至少在看着這一影片的時候，你儘可以忘却苦悶的現實。及至你們走出戲院之後，重新回到不愉快的現實中來，到那時候你們不妨來盡情的哭泣。然而借酒澆愁，是解除苦悶之好方法，現在不妨以歌舞影片的鑒賞來代替酒精的刺戟，這便是明快的歌舞影片，所以能得着一部份歡迎之至理了。當然，這便是製作「雲裳艶曲」類似的影片之社會根據了。</p>
<p>一般的説，通常的歌舞片，那是不注重於内容之實質的。「雲裳艶曲」未嘗不是如此。不過劇作者多少也反映了一點現實。當納許（威康鮑衛爾飾）投機失敗之後，我們不能不聯想想舊社會之基礎的動摇，己經成爲普遍的現象。然而在這情形之下，最感受苦痛的究竟下層社會的人們，所謂上層社會的剥削者，到底不甘心束手待斃，畢竟會想出另一種新的投機方法，以維持他們自己的地位。雖至欺騙奸詐亦在所不惜。本來，在這虚爲奸詐的社會中，一切都是自欺欺人。特别是在這恐慌之中，祇要你有欺騙的本能，你不妨盡量的賣弄。欺騙，偷竊，恐詐，無所不爲。不過所謂「强中自有强中手」，自己騙人，同時也得被人騙。關於這一點，劇作者是這樣寫着的，納許的姘婦自他手中拿着了二千元，不料爲司納普（佛蘭克馬修飾）偷去。司納普自鳴得意，詎知又無形之中落在納許手中了。此外他對於商人的心理，亦描寫得淋漓盡致。杜里亞等怒斥納許仿造時裝，而納許反請他們資助到巴里去剽竊新裝式樣。當時杜等大聲拒絶，但不久却各人都和他私自簽約，這證明現實的商人是何等自私與矛盾。其次在白俄公爵夫人或富人白羅克身上，也將高貴的人們的醜態，暴露殆盡。</p>
<p>如上所述，劇作者用着活潑的譏諷筆調，極生動嘻笑謾駡可謂好極。而導演者又是如此理解劇本，藉着極明快的導演手法，使「雲裳艶曲」獲得極大的成功了。至於鏡頭的活潑，尤其餘事。</p>
<p>當然，以威廉鮑衛爾來飾巨騙納許，自然是非常適當的了。同時和他在「未了塵緣」中合作一次的佛蘭克馬修，在這裏仍使用着那種冷笑，不過不及「未了塵緣」那般和劇情調合罷了。至於幾個女角，却無甚可取。飾白俄公爵夫人的那位，雖還可以，但無特長。其他諸人，都不過是將就過得去而己。</p>
<h3 id="c248">評「鐘聲響了」 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 亞夫</p>
<p>—金城映—</p>
<p>革命，革命，這兩個字近年來的確是呌得怪響的，同時也是怪好聽的。可不是麽？就拿十六年的革命來説，有不少人在血的狂流中英勇的死，同時也有不少人吸着殷紅的血汁而發達了，高陞了。</p>
<p>更可怕的是那般慣會掛羊頭賣狗肉的人們，肩着革命的招牌，實行假革命的事實。甚至於嘴裏高唱着禮義廉恥，而實際上却是利用着假面具以掩蓋他們的醜惡。嗚呼！革命，革命，「有多少罪惡假汝之名以行」。</p>
<p>「鐘聲響了」，在字面上看來，我想一定有多少偉壯的故事。可是每每事實不如想像那末美善，當我們看了這一影片之後，却不免大爲失望了。</p>
<p>自然，我們所必須檢討的便是故事的發展。我們需要革命，這是鐵一般的事實。特别是片中所指出的軍閥混戰的結果，廣大的民衆苦不聊生。所以在這時候，祇有以革命的力量，摧毁舊的一切，而使新的社會在新的經濟機構中生長起來。但是，劇作者是怎樣解釋這一時代的呢？他説：「勇少年應當以身報國」，不要談戀愛。只要敲幾下警鐘，讓少爺們當便衣隊，裏應外合響應國民革命事，一下子便可「革命成功」。（這是指民十六革命而言）而成功了之後呢？劇作者告訴我們説，機器生産了，大批工人有工作做了。這將現實曲解到何等地步啊！不過作者却説明了那是一羣青年學生的把戲，我想這到是忠實的口供。</p>
<p>且丢開這點不説罷，看劇作者是怎樣宣揚他的封建思想的，他主張着效法劉關張結義，居然有三個青年，對着三尊菩薩行鞠躬禮，結果是「異姓兄弟，情逾骨肉」。</p>
<p>再説到文逸民的導演技巧，那末我們可以這樣説，前半部不無可取之處，到後來却不行了。我們看罷，他對於每一畫面的構圖，甚至於畫面内的Ｍoneage多少是用過一番工夫的，比較以前的作品，亦見進步。可是關於畫面的編輯，却不十分合理。譬如開傷時没有很好的介紹出珍珍父子和强華中學的關係，直到一本快完的時候，才使人懂得他們之間的關係，原來如此。不過在這前後，有不少地方却是很簡潔的。到後來弱點愈多，如珍珍在藥店買藥，突然寫到一個富家小姐買香水，在事先没有密切的聯繫，直到珍珍拾了一塊錢。才教人明白他的用意。又如珍珍認識了李蒼生之後，用着一大幅的字幕代替一個過程。其實這一過程的説明，並不煩難，爲什麽要以字幕來代替畫面呢？</p>
<p>前面説過，我們在好些地方可以看出導演的聰明，（當然有許多小疵）不過我們認定一個導演應富是整個影片之負責者的時候，希望他對於劇本的選擇，切不可過於隨便，總得加意審愼纔好。</p>
<p>現在，關於演技，我們認爲范雪朋在飾小女孩的時候，頗有不少善於表演的地方。那俏皮活潑的風度，確甚可取。及至嫁給李蒼生之後，却完全是扭扭揑揑的做戲，一點也没有眞實感了。不消説這也應當由導演負責。姚漪很年青，演戲也很沉着。至於事隔四年，仍是那頂白帽子，又是導演不小心了。飾李蒼生的李雲也還可以過得去。</p>
<p>最後要説的是攝影佈景，都是强華以司力求上進的象徵。但是有些塲面的佈景，我却以爲没有十分誇大有必要。何况窗户和門，都不免顯出痕跡。總之，在小公司的出品中，這「鐘聲響了」，的表現技巧，是還可以值得稱讚的。從這裏可看出中國電影的技巧，的確是在進步了，這是非常可喜的事實。</p>

<p>瓊娜聽了李却的話，差不多要哭出來了。她説她父親死的時候，康納萊夫人親口答應呌她在那兒的。李却説道：「那亦没有用呀。地是她的。你又没有契約和合同。她願意呌你住，就呌你住：她不願意呌你住，你就祇好走，不能儘你的呀。就是，我以前賖给你的錢，現在亦恐怕靠不住了。我爲保護我自己的利益起見，我要和你要個抵押品。我從前不是告訴過你，不敢和康納萊夫人作對的嗎？」他説完了，就去應酬别的顧客去了。瓊娜没有法子，祇好垂頭喪氣地出來。在瓊娜離走之時，李却從眼鏡的上面，看着她説道：「我想你還是去看威爾先生吧。」瓊娜道：「威爾先生出門去了。」李却聳着肩胛説道：「不差的……他到查爾斯頓去了……去結婚去的！」</p>
<p>在却爾斯頓，結婚……威爾有些疑惑了，不過佛琴妮的用意太顯明了。今天宴會，明天</p>
<p>跳舞，錢像流水似的花在他身上，但是他好像没有什麽印象似的。有的時候佛琴妮特意獻些殷勤，倒使他意不過起來，而不能不敷衍敷衍她。他吻着她，但是覺得没有什麽意思。一天晚上，開完了化裝跳舞會，威爾佛琴妮摟在懷裏。她低聲對着威爾道：「你看你穿着那身魔鬼的衣服，好像不大規矩似的。」威爾將她緊緊摟着道：「我自己亦覺得有些不規矩。」於是他們吻着，陶醉着。兩人的心中，好像己經是默許了似的。</p>
<p>不過這種都是一時的誘惑衝動。所以到了明天，威爾覺得清醒了，他想起了昨晚之事，有些懊喪。他去尋着了佛琴妮，向她很誠懇地道歉。他説：「我不能再欺騙你了。我講實話，這件事我實在不能做到底。我亦不能呌你替我們設法去借錢……我不能够……我是眞心喜歡你的……十分的喜歡……但是我愛另外一個人……我不能和你結婚……」他説的話是很誠懇的，應當可以感動一位宅心忠厚的女子的，但是佛琴妮，她雖是笑貌依然，可是在她的眉目之間，己是佈滿了危險的烏雲。她説道：「誰同你提到結婚不結婚的？那恐怕還是你個人的妄想吧。」威爾呌了一聲「佛琴妮」，還想講什麽話，可是佛琴妮不等他講出來，就哼了一聲説道：「你上魔鬼那裏去好了，你和你的佃户之女，還有那幾畝荒田！」</p>

The Japanese are constructing a Japanese military barracks in Hulun, capable of accommodating 5,000 troops. The location is the first line of defense in the event of a Japanese-Russian war. There are only slightly more than 500 Japanese soldiers in Lubin City. The Japanese military frequently sends spies to the border trenches to investigate the activities of Soviet Russian soldiers. Russian planes also frequently fly over the Heilongjiang border for reconnaissance and bomb dropping. The Red Army headquarters is located in Chegcheng. All railway rights north of Lubin are completely under the control of the Russians, with approximately 2,500 locomotives and carriages. There are 200 Japanese soldiers in Boketu, and over 300 Japanese and puppet troops in Zhalantun. They are currently constructing barracks on a large scale. Barracks are being built in three locations in Qiqihar Province, one at the former site of the Jiangwutang, one at the East Barracks, and one at the South Barracks, each extending more than ten li in all directions and equipped with artillery platforms. The Heilongjiang airfield has also been rebuilt and can accommodate 50 aircraft. (1st dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to intelligence reports: (1) After the puppet emperor visited the tombs in Malanyu to pay respects to his ancestors, he ordered the restoration and protection of the dilapidated tombs. Recently, a battalion of puppet troops and a battalion of Japanese troops arrived successively to provide protection, stationed in Malanyu. Twenty-three aircraft are stationed at the airfield at the foot of the mountain, taking off at any time for reconnaissance. It has also been decided to build a smaller airfield near the tombs to permanently station three aircraft for protection. (2) The town of Malanyu originally had over 500 puppet troops stationed there. At the end of last month, another 500 troops were suddenly added, accompanied by more than ten artillery pieces and fifteen light machine guns. Due to the excessive number of puppet troops, it is difficult to station them in the town, so they plan to move to another location, and reinforcements are currently being sent. (3) Because Malanyu Town is close to the Qing imperial tombs and is a gathering place for Manchus, Chinese traitors are taking the opportunity to operate, seeking barracks and establishing supply depots. A Great Manchurian Empire Cigarette Tax Collection Bureau has been established in the town. All cigarette sales in the town and nearby villages within a 20-30 li radius must be inspected and certified by the bureau before they can be sold. Reportedly, each large box (50 small boxes) requires an inspection fee of 3 jiao, and each small box must have an inspection certificate affixed. Violators will be treated as tax evaders and fined ten or a hundred times the amount.

<h3 id="e9">Personal Views on Building the Western Xinjiang Railway <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>According to previous reports, Central Committee member Fu Rulin has a plan to build the Western Xinjiang Railway. The route is planned to run from Xi'an directly to Yili in Xinjiang. Construction will begin as soon as the entire Longhai Railway is completed. It is said that the Longhai Railway can be completed in June of this year. If this plan can be continued, the transportation between Xinjiang and the interior can be opened up. However, Fu's proposal was sent down by the Executive Yuan to the four departments of Railways, Communications, Finance, and Industry for consultation, but no concrete results have been seen. It is difficult to predict what the future holds.</p>
<p>Our country today has many things waiting to be done. However, due to financial constraints, construction should be planned as a whole and priorities should be set. No one can deny this principle. However, careful consideration should be given to what should be done first and what can be delayed. In recent years, the government has paid increasing attention to transportation, especially aviation and highways. However, given the size of our country, the past achievements are difficult to be satisfied. From the perspective of politics, economy, and population distribution, the construction of the Western Xinjiang Railway is a matter of urgency. First, Xinjiang is located between the two great powers of Britain and Russia. Since the September 18th Incident, Russia has had designs on northern Xinjiang, and Britain has had designs on southern Xinjiang. Almost all the turmoil in the province in recent years is related to this international background. Moreover, Xinjiang has a complex ethnic makeup. Han Chinese and Hui people account for less than one-third of the population. The rest are the Uighurs, whose race and culture are very different. They often call for "reviving the Uighurs and destroying the Han." If we do not make plans early, things will become increasingly difficult in the future. Since the completion of the Turkestan-Siberia Railway, the situation in Xinjiang has become very dangerous. It is estimated that 80% of its products are absorbed by Soviet Russia, and it is increasingly isolated from our interior. This is a case of the guest dominating the host. Our country can only sit by and watch the situation develop and cannot take any action because it is beyond our reach. If we can build a railway from Xi'an directly to Yili and Tacheng, and build three or four branch lines to connect the north and south of Xinjiang, then even if something happens, the central army can be quickly transferred. Internal turmoil can be prevented, and external troubles can be reduced. This is one reason why the Western Xinjiang Railway should be built from a political perspective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of economic benefits, building a railway is also essential for developing Xinjiang. For example, the gold in the Altai Mountains is as important as that in Outer Mongolia and Heilongjiang. Only when it can be mined can it be used to support our country's conversion to the gold standard. Coal deposits in Dihua, Yili, and Suiding are everywhere and are second only to those in Shanxi. Other resources such as crude oil, copper, iron, jade, and stone are abundant and cannot be quantified. The Yili area also has forests stretching for hundreds of square miles, which can make up for our country's losses in Jilin. The silk and agricultural products in Hotan and Shule in southern Xinjiang are similar to those in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As long as the railway is open, we can adjust the surplus and deficiency with our interior. This is the second reason why the Western Xinjiang Railway should be built from an economic perspective.</p>
<p>According to the results of the investigation by Professor Tawney, an economic historian at the University of London, who came to China in 1930, most of China's population is concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the three major river basins. The coastal areas are particularly densely populated, which is very uneven compared to the sparsely populated border areas. We further examine the population situation in the coastal areas and find that their density is actually higher than in most countries. For example, Japan has always said that its population is too large and invades everywhere. In fact, the average population of its mainland is only 4,078 per square mile, while the coastal provinces of our country are far above that. For example, the average population of Shandong is 614 people per square mile, Zhejiang is 657 people, Jiangsu is 896 people, the Taihu Lake area is as high as 6,000 people, the Chengdu Plain reaches 2,000 people, and the lower reaches of the Pearl River are also very densely populated. From this point of view, our population surplus is actually more pressing than that of Japan. Shouldn't we start solving this problem earlier? The three northeastern provinces have always been the end of the northern population declaration. After the September 18th Incident, they have been forcibly occupied by Japan. The Nanyang area and Manchuria restricts the activities of overseas Chinese, which is very strict and difficult to develop. Today, to solve the population problem in the coastal provinces, the most appropriate way is to arrange for them to settle in the northwest. Xinjiang's area is 15 times larger than Zhejiang's, but its population is only 2.5 million, which is less than a corner of Shanghai. Its sparseness is evident. If the Western Xinjiang Railway becomes a reality, then all the surplus population, with the government's assistance, can be sent to Xinjiang as pioneers of development. The banditry caused by the overpopulation and difficult life in the coastal areas can be reduced. There is nothing better than this to achieve multiple goals at once.</p>
<p>As for how to carry out the construction, there are two points to consider: labor and funding. Our country has more than one million soldiers. Apart from fighting in civil wars, they can be said to be doing nothing. If we want to talk about reducing the military, they will become bandits and cause even greater harm. The best plan for now is to use them to build roads. After the roads are built, they can be used for reclamation and to defend against bandits. They can also engage in farming and animal husbandry. In this way, the military can be reduced without actually reducing it. This principle can be adopted for the construction of the Western Xinjiang Railway. The main line of the road runs for more than 6,000 li from Xi'an to Tacheng, and it would be a million li to build a circular Xinjiang line. Calculated at a price of three yuan per li, it would require 400 to 500 million yuan. Our country's financial strength will definitely not be able to bear such a huge amount of money. However, the total amount of domestic debt we have issued over the years has also reached hundreds of millions of yuan. If there is really no way to raise the money, and we have to consider the next best option, then it is not impossible to borrow foreign debt. However, it must not harm China's sovereignty. The country from which the loan is borrowed must be one that is not geographically adjacent, so as to prevent it from using the excuse of protecting the road to occupy the entire territory and turning into a continuation of the Northeast.</p>
<p>With the suppression of the Fujian Incident and the reduction of banditry, the unification of the country is beginning to take shape. If all parties can cooperate sincerely and keep the country and the nation in mind, broaden their horizons, and strive for construction for the sake of consolidating the border, then the achievements will be more than just the development of Xinjiang.

<p>London Silver Agreement Approved by Six Countries</p>
<p>Spain and Peru Have Not Approved</p>
<p>(Washington) Tomorrow is the deadline for countries to approve the London Silver Agreement. According to Senator Pittman, leader of the Senate silver bill, the countries that have approved the agreement are the United States, Mexico, Canada, India, China, and Australia. However, there have been no reports of approval from Spain and Peru to date. Some view this as an indication of Spain and Peru's opposition to approving the agreement. Senator Pittman is the initiator of the London Silver Agreement and the vanguard of other silver bills. According to Pittman, the non-participation of Spain and Peru does not hinder the materialization of the agreement. Pittman's reason is that Spain and Peru's position in the world economic conference is relatively unimportant and easily absorbed by other countries. Today, advocates of using silver as currency stated that the content of the London Silver Agreement is clear and accurate, which is its advantage. Moreover, many silver-using countries can propose practical limits to bind themselves without any hesitation. India has now approved the agreement, so in the next four years, India will sell approximately 140,000,000 ounces of silver. Beyond this limit, India can also sell silver to the United States to pay war debts, but the total amount must not exceed 176,000,000 ounces. China has also acknowledged that it will no longer sell silver obtained from melting silver coins within four years. The London Silver Agreement stipulates that the United States will purchase 114,000,000 ounces of newly mined silver annually for a period of four years, and the value of each ounce of silver will be 64.5 cents (US). When the London Silver Agreement was drafted, there was an understanding among the countries that if the agreement was not approved by the proposed countries by April 1, 1934, silver-producing countries would be restricted, except for silver-using countries.

<p>Special Attention to China and the United States</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Hirota, in order to refresh Japanese diplomacy, will mobilize all personnel in the home province and overseas envoys. He will actively work on issues related to various countries. He intends to summon overseas envoys to clarify the domestic situation and understand the Japanese government's policies, and to directly impart secret strategies in order to break the impasse in a unified manner. First, he ordered Ambassador to China Arima to return to the country in early April, and Ambassador to the United States Saito may also return to Japan in early May. In addition, ambassadors such as Sato and Mushanokoji in Turkey will return to the country one after another to inquire about the latest situation in various countries in detail, and then establish an original diplomatic policy, completely breaking away from the traditional diplomatic concepts and affairs, and replacing them with new strategies to cope with the dangerous situation in 1935-1936. All diplomatic work concerning Anglo-Japanese, Dutch-Japanese, Indian-Japanese, and relations with Soviet Russia, as well as other comprehensive diplomatic work, should be thoroughly refreshed. As for Ambassador to Italy Matsushima, Ambassador to Germany Nagai, and other overseas ambassadors, ministers, consuls-general, and consuls, all those who wish to confer will be allowed to return to the country. They should be encouraged to express their opinions as much as possible on diplomatic work. Ambassador to Germany Nagai has only recently taken office and is fully aware of the domestic situation, so he may not need to apply for leave to return to the country. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Ota and Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira may also not be asked to return to the country for convenience. However, Ambassador to France Sato, on his way home, should pass through the United States to inquire about news related to disarmament issues, as his situation is different from that of Ambassador to the United States Saito, and he may be able to make the American people fully understand Japan's position. This is the general situation. (1st Joint Dispatch)</p>

<p>Adjusting Far East Issues</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Hirota mentioned the Manchurian problem and the issue of guaranteeing Pacific security in his note to US Secretary of State Hull on February 21, expressing his intention to begin consultations between Japan and the United States in the form of mutual agreements prior to the naval disarmament conference. However, in his reply to Foreign Minister Hirota on March 3, Secretary of State Hull avoided the aforementioned Japan-US consultations. The United States' intention to convene a conference of countries related to the Nine-Power Treaty has caused dissatisfaction in various circles in Japan. The Nine-Power Treaty is intended to protect the interests of so-called countries in the Far East, and it clearly does not include "Manchukuo." Therefore, Hull's intention seems to be to convene a second Washington Conference to discuss the Manchurian problem. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' intention is to disregard Secretary of State Hull's true intentions, but to absolutely oppose the conference of countries related to the Nine-Power Treaty, and to consistently advocate the following individual agreements to resolve the necessary issues: (1) The independence of "Manchukuo" is an obvious fact and does not violate the Nine-Power Treaty. This is very clear in both theory and history. (2) Convening a conference of countries related to the Nine-Power Treaty in such a situation would only lead to empty talk and would not be beneficial, and would only worsen international sentiment. (3) Revising the Nine-Power Treaty, such as the inclusion of "Manchukuo," is a matter for the relevant countries to consider after recognizing "Manchukuo." (4) The adjustment of Far East issues must be conducted through Japan-US [Telegraph].)</p>

<p>(Bo Li) According to news from Harbin, the Manchu police continue to relentlessly trample on cultural institutions along the Chinese Eastern Railway. Recently, they have closed the clubs in Yao Men, Zha Lan Tun, and Heng Tao He Zi (all transliterated) stations for searches. The Japanese military police confiscated the photo of General Baron Kalonin hanging in the Heng Tao He Zi club. On March 28, the Soviet Consul-General in Harbin, Slavitzky, met with Manchu negotiator Shi Luben, demanding that he immediately stop the police's barbaric behavior towards Soviet citizens and Chinese Eastern Railway cultural institutions, and release all Soviet residents who had been arrested. On March 29, news of such rampant behavior followed. Manchu road police from the Hulun station broke into a kindergarten and summoned several Soviet road staff for full-body searches. The Soviet Consul-General again met with the Manchu negotiator on the 31st, resolutely demanding that such police rampant behavior be judged promptly. (31st TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>Why Such Close Attention to Singapore?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British naval base in Singapore has an important relationship with the Japanese navy's maritime policy, and the naval authorities are paying close attention to it. Judging from the progress of the construction to date, it can be the most successful base after completion. (1) The construction of fortresses, the installation of gun emplacements, and the construction of barracks have been largely completed, and are scheduled to be completed by September 1935. If necessary, they can be completed at any time. (2) Large docks and auxiliary facilities have been built in what was originally forest and swamp land. The docks in front of the docks have also been completed and can accommodate the largest warships. The completion of the docks is also imminent in a few months, and only ground work will remain. The initial budget was 10 million pounds, but it was completed with only 6.9 million pounds. (3) The air base has a squadron of bombers and flying boats. It seems too few for the British Far East air base, but since air transport from the home country to Singapore can arrive in four days, there is no need for too many permanent aircraft. (4) In addition, there are flight squadrons organized by Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, and others in the Straits Settlements. (1st Electric Communication Telegram)</p>

<p>[P British Finances Stable]</p>
<p>Surplus of Thirty Million Pounds</p>
<p>(London) The British fiscal year ended today. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there was a surplus of 31,144,000 pounds. The Ministry of Finance tonight wired this good news to Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, who is currently fishing in the River Dee. When the budget was proposed last April, the estimated surplus was 1.3 million pounds and did not include provisions for paying the statutory sinking fund or repaying US debts. The total revenue for the past year was £724,567,000 and expenditure was £693,419,000, including the debt repayment sinking fund and war debt payments. Last year, the Chancellor of the Exchequer's expected revenue was £698,800,000 and expenditure was £697,500,000. In terms of revenue over the past year, income tax and surtax totaled £281,000,000, which is roughly in line with the budget. The largest increase in revenue was from property tax, which totaled £15 million, an increase of £10.05 million compared to the budget. Customs revenue was £286,000,000, also an increase of £17 million compared to the budget. Postal revenue was £13.1 million, exceeding the budget by £1.5 million. There was a special item of £10 million in miscellaneous revenue, which was the surplus from the war debt discount fund. In terms of expenditure over the past year, interest payments on national debt were reduced by £11 million compared to the budget. This amount was used to pay the unbudgeted credit payments to the United States of £3.25 million, and the remaining £7.75 million was paid into the debt repayment reserve. Today, the total amount of British floating debt is 1,450,000,000 pounds, including treasury bills of 799,000,000 pounds and temporary borrowings of 449,900,000 pounds, an increase of 34 million pounds compared to last year. However, the increase is due to the issuance of an exchange stabilization fund of 200 million pounds, which has considerable assets to offset. Therefore, after excluding the exchange stabilization fund, the amount of British floating debt today is 166,000,000 pounds less than on this day last year. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>First Payment of Over Three Million Marks</p>
<p>(Washington) The US State Department and the German Ambassador today reached an agreement that Germany will pay 3,177,125 marks for the overdue 50,000 mark military occupation expenses and various reparations owed to the United States, in order to show good faith. This payment is due on April 3. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) This afternoon, Secretary of State Hull announced that Germany has now agreed to pay $1,250,000 in gold to cover the German installment payments to the United States due today. The total amount of this war debt is US$50 million. The German side has formally notified Hull that the payment will be made on April 3. Hull then informed the German Ambassador to the United States, Luther, that the US government cannot reduce or cancel war debts without the permission of Congress, and that there is no hope for a reduction or cancellation of war debts in the current Congress. Hull told reporters that the war debt due today is that stipulated in the 1930 war debt agreement, and its total amount is equal to all the interest on the installment payments of war debts, plus the German reparations to the United States for military expenses. Since President Hoover implemented the moratorium, Germany has not paid the interest and military expenses mentioned above. The total amount of German war debts to the United States today, calculated at the previous value of gold at US$20.67 per ounce, is US$724,186,141. Calculated at the current value of gold at US$35 per ounce, it is US$427,704,335. Hull further explained that since President Hoover again stipulated the exchange rate of the US currency at 59.06, the German war debts to the US automatically decreased to US$296,481,806, and the total amount of war debts owed to the US by various countries also decreased by approximately US$9,000,000,000. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently made a report on war debts, stating that Finland is the only European country that can pay war debts on time according to the treaty. In addition, countries such as France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Estonia have already reserved funds, but have not paid a penny from July 1932 to January 4, 1934.

<p>(Paris) The rumor that the Foreign Minister will visit Poland and Czechoslovakia has been circulating for a long time. It was mentioned when Ponggu was the Foreign Minister, but it has not yet materialized. Recently, Foreign Minister Barthou has decided to go to Warsaw on April 22, staying until the 24th.

<p>(Berlin) The Berlin correspondent of the Qing Yi Bao has studied the first budget bill of the National Socialist government and obtained reference data from the amounts of expenditure on the army, navy, and air force, which have not been published in German newspapers. According to the correspondent's report, the German budget for military expenditure can be analyzed as follows: (A) Army Expenditure</p>
<p>1. Staff Department Expenditure: 9,250,000 marks (an increase of 1,750,000 marks compared to 1932)</p>
<p>2. Salaries and allowances for officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers: 246,375,000 marks</p>
<p>3. Clothing: 35,500,000 marks (an increase of 10,000,000 marks compared to 1932)</p>
<p>4. Military Food: 24,000,000 marks (an increase of 4,000,000 marks compared to 1932)</p>
<p>5. Barracks Housing and Accessory Equipment Expenses: 52,000,000 marks (an increase of 23,000,000 marks compared to 1932)</p>
<p>An increase of 11,000,000 marks compared to 1932)</p>
<p>(B) Navy</p>
<p>1. Salaries and allowances for officers and soldiers: 27,500,000 marks</p>
<p>2. Staff Department Expenditure and Barracks Housing, etc.: 23,750,000 marks</p>
<p>3. Maintenance of Arsenals: 27,000,000 marks</p>
<p>(C) Air Force</p>
<p>Air force expenditure has increased sharply, and there is no need to compare it with 1932. The air force budget is 21,000,000 marks (of which 50,000,000 marks are for air defense expenditure, and 15,000,000 marks are for special expenditure this year). The allowances for volunteers are 260,000,000 marks. The above is the general expenditure for the army, navy, and air force. If the expenditure for the National Socialist Party army is combined with the formal national defense expenditure, it can reach 1,364,500,000 marks, equivalent to 8,000,000,000 French francs.

<p>With the Blue Shirt Army as the Main Force</p>
<p>Brussels European General He Cao Yuan Ximu is currently leading the Blue Shirt Army to plot a major move. He's goal is to build a new country in Western Europe, including most of the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as a corner of France, named the Greater Netherlands, which will stand on the same front as the Fascist Party. Today, He spoke to US reporters about his work. In his room in the small town of Michel, he hung photos of Mussolini and Hitler, and a map of Europe, with the outline of his Greater Netherlands painted in black. He is short and sturdy, with a very military demeanor. He said that he will build a strong country to unite and nurture the Dutch people. He was active in this country before the war, seeking to separate the Flanders region from Belgium. He was later wanted by Belgium, and was elected to the National Assembly after the war. The reason why He intends to rebuild a new country is influenced by Charles Maurras, the leader of the French Royalist Party. After leaving the National Assembly in 1931, he devoted himself to activities, and his momentum is increasing, and his economy is also very abundant. However, He denied that it was provided by Germany. (31st National Telegram)</p>

<p>Fully Strengthens the Western Bulwark</p>
<p>(Moscow) The local press is paying close attention to the extension of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania for ten years. Izvestia stated that the Soviet Union's attitude towards its Baltic neighbors has always been based on recognizing their independence and striving to consolidate and develop the friendly relations between these countries and the Soviet Union. The Soviet government, at a time when the threat of imperialist war is rapidly intensifying, has to devote its full efforts to strengthening the bulwark against war. Some small countries, especially the Baltic countries, are coveted by those patriotic groups, which are extremely frank and have recently gained strength. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government's proposal to extend the non-aggression treaty for ten years is aimed at safeguarding the economic and governmental independence of the Baltic countries. The Soviet government hopes that other governments will also support the true independence of the Baltic countries through this proposal. Zhenliang Bao particularly emphasized the fact that this proposal was launched at a time when new waves were rising in the European situation, and the threat of war was most dangerous to the Baltic countries. Therefore, "the Soviet government's proposal is a new and valuable contribution to peace." (31st TASS Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e35">US Fugitive Case May Cause Dispute Between Turkey and Greece <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Greek Foreign Minister Hopes for Peaceful Resolution</p>
<p>Recent developments in the case of Mr. Insull, the American beauty from Constantine and former Chicago financial giant, threaten to create a dispute between Turkey and Greece. Turkish authorities, at the request of the US government, today ordered the arrest of Insull on a Greek ship. The ship has been detained in the Bosphorus Strait for forty-eight hours. However, Mr. Insull refuses to leave the ship, and the Greek shipowner has protested the detention to the Greek Consul in this area. Mr. Boop, Insull's lawyer, has been extremely active in Athens today, lodging a serious protest with the Greek Foreign Minister, pointing out that the Turkish government's detention of the Greek ship violates international law. It is expected that the Greek government will send a diplomatic note to Turkey regarding this matter. After receiving the Greek shipowner's protest forwarded by the Greek Consul in Constantine, Greek Foreign Minister General Maximos immediately telegraphed the Greek Minister in Ankara to question the Turkish government's reasons for detaining the ship. Mr. Boop has been receiving detailed reports in the past twenty-four hours, protesting to the Greek Foreign Minister that the Greek flag is not being respected at sea. He also telegraphed Turkish President Kemal, accusing Turkey of becoming a constable for the United States. Later, he sent separate telegrams to Turkish newspapers, urging them to jointly protest to the Turkish government. Mr. Boop received a telegram from the Greek shipowner, which read: "Turkish authorities allowed me to go ashore and instructed me to arrest Insull. I immediately protested to the Turkish government and reported to the Greek Consul." The Greek Foreign Minister recently informed Mr. Boop that he has taken appropriate steps and hopes that this matter can be resolved peacefully. Mr. Insull still hopes that the Greek flag will continue to provide him with protection. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been very cordial recently, but this matter may cause international difficulties. The Greek government feels very difficult, although it has made every effort to push Mr. Insull out of the country at the request of the United States, but the ship he is on is a Greek ship, which is virtually still within Greek territory. And the detainer of the ship is Turkey, with whom Greece has been striving for friendship for the past twelve years. Therefore, the Greek Foreign Ministry is thinking day and night, wanting to resolve this matter with a relaxed diplomatic approach, but public opinion in Athens is criticizing the Turkish government's detention of the Greek ship.

<p>Constantine, April 1st (Reuters) - Mr. Insull, the American beauty who was formerly a financial giant in Chicago and is now an overseas fugitive, disembarked from the ship this afternoon and was interrogated by the Third Criminal Court.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) How the International Labor Conference, to be convened in Geneva this June, will deal with the issue of boycotting Japanese goods is a matter of great concern to various parties at home and abroad. The International Labor Bureau has now dispatched its Director of Research, Mr. Molitor, who is scheduled to depart for Japan on April 3 to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of labor conditions. On the one hand, it will also investigate the important reasons for the boycott of Japanese goods, such as the low wages of Japanese workers and their ability to work long hours, as alleged by foreigners. The attitude of Japanese labor groups towards the above issues, as well as the views of Japanese labor representatives, are key points that may cause international disputes, so the developments are worthy of great attention. The Executive Department of the Japanese Labor Union Conference will nominate representatives in the next few days to meet with Home Minister Yamamoto. Before the departure of the representatives to the Labor Conference, the Japanese government, labor and management representatives, and other relevant parties will convene a conference to discuss countermeasures in detail and try to bring opinions into line. If the conference fails to materialize, the labor side will have to form a joint conference on its own and instruct the representatives, such as Mr. Kikukawa, to handle the matter accordingly.

<p>Three Killed in Bloody Shootout in Tavern</p>
<p>Intricate Case Related to Previous Major Incident</p>
<p>Marseilles - At 1 AM today, four young men were sitting at a table in a Marseilles tavern when three men pushed open the door and entered. The four young men immediately drew guns and fired at the newcomers, killing two of them on the spot and accidentally killing a tavern customer. The four men then rushed out of the tavern. By the time the people in the tavern recovered from their shock and got up to chase them, the whereabouts of the murderers were unknown. One of the dead men had a loaded pistol in his pocket, with his hand already on it, but he was shot down before he could take it out. Only one of the three men was unharmed. According to him, he did not know who the murderers were. The residents of Marseilles were shocked by this tragedy. It is expected that this matter is related to the arrest of Feng Queer and Shi Piliito on March 29. Feng and others are accused of murder and robbery, as they are involved in the murder of Prosecutor Pu Lansi in February. They are currently being interrogated to clarify the suspected murder of Mr. Pu. These two men not only have power in the underworld in Marseilles, but also can influence the municipal government. Today's murder case is likely related to the arrest of Mr. Feng. The fact that gangs are rampant in the city of Marseilles has shocked the whole of France. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>&gt;P[Complex Internal Organization of the Pseudo-Government in Southern Xinjiang</p>
<p>--Difficult to Sustain--</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the establishment of the pseudo-government of the Hui people in Southern Xinjiang, it has been quite a while, but the political orders have not been able to reach beyond Kashgar and Aksu. The internal organization is extremely complex. Although it has the backing of a certain country, it has recently felt quite restrained in its actions. Moreover, most of the local people oppose it, so it seems difficult to maintain it. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is inconvenient for the four consulates in the areas bordering the new Russian areas, such as Tashkent, to be subordinate to the Xinjiang Provincial Government. Therefore, they have been reorganized and directly administered by the Ministry. This matter is currently in progress. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a senior military officer from Xinjiang, Ma Zhongying fled from Gansu to Xinjiang, trying to consolidate Zhang's power and arbitrarily robbed and killed people. This time, he was defeated by the provincial army, and the remnants should not be difficult to eliminate. The Hui people in Southern Xinjiang have organized the so-called "Gharjistan Republic" in Kashgar, which seems to be a Soviet Russian tone and is definitely not a self-determination movement. I plan to suggest to the government to quickly select and send senior officials to visit and comfort the people. The Hui and Han nationalities have always had a good impression of the Han people and strongly support the central government. If senior officials are sent to appease them, all the troubles will be solved easily. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Japan's Accelerating Seizure of Gold Mines in Jilin and Heilongjiang <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>--Investigation Shows Value of 4.7 Billion Yuan--</p>
<p>--Organizing a Large-Scale Mining Company--</p>
<p>Harbin News: The provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang have always been the richest gold-producing areas in our country. In the early years, they were operated by the people of China and Russia, using completely placer mining methods. Due to outdated technology and lack of organization, there were no statistical figures for reference. The Japanese side is now actively engaged in development based on the survey results of Russian geologist Mr. Azolto and the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd., and is organizing the Manchuria Gold Mining Company, with a fixed capital of 12 million yuan. The pseudo-government authorities, the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the Oriental Development Company will purchase shares. The gold mine, which was originally richly endowed in China, will all be acquired by the Japanese. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Gold Mines in the Li Hongzhang Era As early as when Li Hongzhang was the Minister of Beiyang in the Qing Dynasty, the Mohe River in the northernmost part of Heilongjiang Province was discovered to have gold mines. At that time, Russians gathered to reach thousands of people, and Chinese people gradually increased. During the eighth and ninth years of Guangxu, the Chinese and Russian population totaled more than 10,000. Within these two years, the area produced more than 219,000 taels of gold sand, worth more than 13.8 million yuan, which was extremely prosperous. At that time, as a result of negotiations between Li Hongzhang and the Russian government, the Russians in the area were driven out. In the fifteenth year of Guangxu, the Mohe Gold Factory was reorganized and run by the government. In recent years, it has gradually declined, with annual output of only a thousand taels or so.</p>
<p>Russian-Announced Ore Amount According to Mr. Aniertorto, a Russian geologist and trustee of the Harbin Office of the South Manchuria Railway, the total amount of gold ore buried in northern Manchuria is 94 million taels, with a value of 4.7 billion yuan. Mr. A is a geological expert, and the aforementioned amount of reserves is presumably estimated by comprehensively considering both theory and facts.</p>
<p>Investigation by the South Manchuria Railway According to the investigation by the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd., from 1926 to 1930, the amount of gold produced in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces was as follows:</p>
<p>Jilin Province Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>1926 47,800 2,184,600</p>
<p>1927 50,000 1,733,150</p>
<p>1928 50,000 1,282,500</p>
<p>1930 550,000 1,420,000</p>
<p>According to the left table, the amount of production in Jilin Province is small, but the actual amount may be several times this.</p>
<p>Surveying the Location of the Ore Bed There are also so-called mountain gold and rock gold, which are called ore beds. However, the ore bed area has not been carefully inspected. Because the source of placer gold ultimately belongs to mountain gold, it can be inferred that there must be gold mines in the upstream of the placer gold site. There has been no investigation in Jilin and Heilongjiang before. Japan is planning to investigate the distribution of placer gold and the state of mountain gold burial at the same time.</p>
<p>Data on Gold Production in Heilongjiang Province According to the "Mining Industry Records" published by Mr. Xie Zhongjiarong, the total amount of gold produced in Heilongjiang Province is estimated to be 500,000 taels per year. According to Mr. Dugasayev, a Russian, in October of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the estimated amount was as follows:</p>
<p>Aihui 135,000 taels Huma 48,000 taels</p>
<p>Mohe 9,000 taels Shiwei 19,000 taels</p>
<p>Nenjiang 2,000 taels Xiaoyuling 8,000 taels</p>
<p>Total 222,000 taels</p>
<p>According to this figure, it seems to be too exaggerated. The figures investigated by the South Manchuria Railway Company are listed below for reference:</p>
<p>Location 1928 1929 1930</p>
<p>Fengyuan 10,000 5,000 10,000</p>
<p>Guxi 50 100</p>
<p>Yuanli 1,000</p>
<p>Liyuan 1,000</p>
<p>Dacheng 1,000</p>
<p>Yubian</p>
<p>Zhicheng 1,000</p>
<p>Zhenxing</p>
<p>Xingan 6,000 2,000 10,000</p>
<p>Huma River 1,000 1,000</p>
<p>Yiken River 2,000 1,500</p>
<p>Fulahanchi Gan River 900</p>
<p>Jilalin 4,000 1,000 1,000</p>
<p>Taiping 2,400</p>
<p>Wutong River 1,000</p>
<p>Hejin River 2,500</p>
<p>Total 25,650 8,000 28,400</p>
<p>According to the right table, there are significant changes in the amount of production each year. It is impossible to investigate whether this situation is related to the ore bed. The Japanese are studying it.</p>
<p>Gold-Producing Areas in Jilin The main gold-producing areas in Jilin Province are Ning'an, Muling, Yilan, Fangzheng, Mishan, and other counties in the northeast, as well as the vast gold-producing area in the southeastern part of the province bordering Fengtian. Among them, the Jiapigou owned by Han Dengju is well-known to Chinese and foreigners. In the early years, members of the Japanese Mining Industry Investigation Group came to the site for investigation and said that the gold mine was a rare ore vein in Manchuria. The factory has a clear width of about four feet and extends for more than 6,000 feet. There are three ore veins. No matter who, it is regarded as a promising gold mine. Based on this example, there are still a large number of gold veins similar to Jiapigou buried in various parts of Jilin. The amount of production in Jilin Province has always been collected by small-scale agricultural operations, and there is no way to collect statistics. The amount of gold production investigated by the South Manchuria Railway Company in Jilin Province is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Location 1928 1929 1930</p>

<p>—Northeast People Suffer Cruel Treatment—</p>
<p>Shenyang Communication: When the Japanese army first occupied the Northeast, it first implemented its appeasement policy, claiming to be a friendly country. After the puppet organization was completed, it used it for its own purposes, and then acted arbitrarily and brutally. The following is a record of its recent actions in Shenyang:</p>
<h3 id="e66">Secret Agents Do Evil <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The special service agencies, gendarmerie, and garrison of the Japanese army all hire Chinese traitors and those who are proficient in Japanese as secret agents. They go to various entertainment venues or private homes every day to secretly investigate whether there are any anti-pseudo and anti-Japanese behaviors. For example, if someone worked in a certain organization in the Northeast before the incident and is now unemployed, they are regarded as anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese elements. First, they extort money, and then they lead a team to arrest them, inflict extremely cruel punishments, and put them to death. The Japanese army also lets bandits run into various villages and let them harass them. Then, they order the pseudo-national military police to go to the villages to suppress the bandits. Rape, murder, arson, and fornication are everywhere. Wherever they pass, no one is spared.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Vagrant Harassment <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Japanese vagrants collude with local bandits and hooligans to form fraud groups. They carry out large-scale fraud in cities and villages. Some even openly go to the villages to order the village chiefs to collect money from each household, or hide stolen goods to defraud farmers, or form gangs in cities to commit theft.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Rewarding Informants <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army not only secretly deployed a network of spies, but also bought over local ruffians and bullies as spies and rewarded informants. For each case reported, they are rewarded according to the size of the case, or paid a salary of five yuan, six yuan, or more than ten yuan per case. As a result, many unemployed and ignorant hooligans are bought and harmed each other. The poisonous plan is conceivable.</p>

<p>Recently, in the villages along the Anfeng-Shenhai line, the Japanese army has ordered each village to send several young men aged 18 to 24 (according to the number of households, each village has at least one and at most six). On the surface, they are given military training. In the future, they will return home after completing their studies and organize local militia. In fact, they have already been sent to the Jilin and Heilongjiang borders to undertake the transportation and construction work of the Japanese army. The farmers all know this situation and have to endure it under the threat of power.</p>

<p>The Japanese police station raises a large number of police dogs in the affiliated areas along the South Manchuria Railway and trains them to bite people. Sunjia Station has the most dogs, about 400. Many livestock of the villagers were bitten to death. Many people in the vicinity do not dare to go to the station and call it the vicious dog circle. Every time the Japanese army captures our suspected people, they first torture them severely and then throw them into the dog circle to feed the dogs. The dogs compete for food, and the limbs are split apart. The tragic situation is unbearable to see. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Pseudo-Legislature President Zhao Xinbo Suddenly Turns Passive <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>——Repeatedly Struck, His Spirits Are Low——</p>
<p>——Publicly Shows Passivity, Secretly Forms Factions——</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: Zhao Xinbo, the President of the pseudo-National Legislature, had already colluded with the Japanese before the Northeast fell, seeking foreign aid to develop his great desire for promotion and wealth. At the beginning of the puppet Puyi's usurpation, he again engaged in major activities, plotting to fill a certain important ministerial position in order to manipulate the pseudo-national government. This greatly displeased the Japanese side. As a result, he only obtained the position of president of the legislature, which was a great disappointment. Like Yan Jin and Zheng Xiaoxu, who flattered the Japanese daily, and Xi Qia, who acted in concert, he also tried to seize the opportunity to act, but he stopped because he did not get the consent of the Japanese. Zhao tried to make moves several times, but was struck down each time. Therefore, he became disheartened, sighing all day long, exhaling smoke, regretting that his many years of hard work had not resulted in an opportunity to betray the country for personal gain. So, he publicly showed passivity and secretly formed factions, secretly contacting the leaders of the pseudo-army. What kind of attempts he is making is unknown, but it has been discovered by the Japanese, who are paying close attention to his actions. If there is a flaw, I am afraid that Zhao will die without a burial place. The end of a traitor is hateful and pitiful.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Departing North from the Capital <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>At 5:00 PM on the 11th, I left the capital to cross the river and took a train north from Pukou. The 7:00 PM express train had few people and spacious seats, somewhat similar to the Shanghai-Ping train, but not as new and clean. The train traveled for thirty-five minutes and arrived in Chuxian County, Anhui. I saw many people selling bamboo baskets, hand baskets, and live chickens, and each vendor had lanterns, illuminating the area like daytime. Mr. Zhang Dechong from Chu boarded the train and talked about the provincial No. 8 middle school in the city, with more than 500 students. The facilities are also relatively complete, but girls are not allowed to study together. There are no girls' middle schools in neighboring counties, so very few female primary school graduates have the opportunity to receive secondary education. This is probably the same educational style in Jiangbei. Mr. Zhang is now the director of the Quanxiao County official factory office. He also said that there are many barren mountains and wasteland in Anhui Province. In Quanxiao County alone, there are as many as 80,000 mu, accounting for about three-tenths of the cultivated land. Half of it has now been reclaimed. The selling price per mu is no more than twenty yuan, and the official factory office is still making a large profit.</p>
<p>At 5:00 AM the next morning, drizzling rain fell. The train arrived at Tongshan (that is, Xuzhou). The city is located at the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways, connecting the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan. Commerce has always been developed. Last year, due to the impact of the recession, many banks and businesses went bankrupt. It has been a long time, and there is still no sign of recovery in the market. From here to the north, copper coins are only used in "large denominations" (that is, those worth twenty wen). If there are small denominations worth ten, you must exchange them out when you leave here. It is calculated that every eight small denominations can get five large denominations. Silver coins or corner notes from different provinces are not used in the north. If you are going to the Northwest, if you do not take the road through Suining, you should transfer to a train westward here.</p>
<p>In Tengxian County, Shandong Province, vendors sell full baskets of yellow pears, which are cheap and easy to carry, but the quality is rough and the taste is bland, good to look at but not to eat. Looking out the window as the train travels, the rain stops and the clouds clear. The ten thousand acres of wheat fields have leaves and seedlings that are two or three inches long, neatly arranged, interspersed with yellow soil, just like a large floral cloth with "yellow ground and green stripes." Northerners plant wheat in rows, which is not comparable to the random sowing in the South. Next to the fields, there are many willow branches with subtle spring intentions hanging down, and there are small birds on them, flying like shuttles. Every time the train stops abruptly, you can leisurely hear their chirping, as if they are declaring their freedom and joy. The ancients said, "Nature lends me its writings," and it is not wrong.</p>
<p>The rivers in Shandong Province are flooded during the rainy season and completely dry during the dry season, turning into roads. Water conservancy is rarely seen. Large rivers like the Yellow River sell a lot but have little profit. Governing them in ancient and modern times has not yet found a good method that works once and for all. Therefore, the irrigation of fields mostly relies on well water, which is drawn by human or animal power, which is twice the effort for half the result. There are many wells, and the wellheads are built with stones and poles, which also take up a lot of space. In addition, the cultivated land is mixed with graves, with mounds of earth like hills, and attached with land god monuments, all of which are enough to gradually reduce the cultivated land. It is requested that graves be buried in the fields. After several years, after being eroded by wind and rain, they can become large and small, and small can become flat ground, but it still takes a long time, and the stone tablets still stand tall, which is indeed impossible to improve.</p>
<p>At 11:45, I arrived in Yanzhou. The station is built as a "Jinpu Garden," with ponds and mountains, but lacks forest scenery. The city walls of the county seat are dilapidated, but very high, and the roofs of the buildings inside the city cannot be seen. Qufu has the Confucius Forest, the Zhougong Temple, the Sacred Temple, the Yanzi Temple, the Qisheng Wang Tomb, and the Zhou Lu Pan Pool, all famous scenic spots, which are far from the station, and I saw nothing. Only towering black mountains stretch endlessly, moving and getting higher, to show that Mount Tai is approaching. No one arrived at Taian. Many people scrambled to see Mount Tai. A villager forgot about the glass transparency, wanting to stick his head out of the window, and a piece of glass shattered with a bang, both shocked and ashamed, and his forehead was bleeding. I took out the medicine cabinet to apply medicine to the wound, and others persuaded him to move to another car to avoid compensation. Mount Tai is the first of the Five Mountains in China, towering hundreds of miles, overlooking the mountains. In the middle are the Jade Emperor Pavilion, the Wangmu Pool, the Guanshu Waterfall Pavilion, the Zhangren Peak, the Riguang Peak, and the Qin Emperor's Wordless Stele, etc. It is truly a great sight within the characters. The villager "looked up to the high mountains" and bumped his head and bled, which was not without reason. I remember going north last spring, just when the Great Wall War was breaking out. The anti-Japanese slogans seen along the way were more and more numerous the further north I went, and more and more intense. Now, it is just the opposite. In front of Taian Station, Ma Hongkui built a new "Monument to the Martyrs of the 15th Route Army for Suppressing the Rebellion" in memory of the Battle of the 19th Year, and a "Memorial Pavilion" on the mountain that issued orders. It should be covered with slogans. I did not know the true face of Mount Lu. Now, I pass by it again and only now know that it is this. Also, the city walls that I saw last year, which were covered with various slogans, have been newly painted with large characters of Jintan and other advertisements, which are once again shining brightly, making me feel particularly glaring.</p>
<p>From here to each station, more and more people boarded the train, and most of them were farmers, going to Tianjin and Luan to visit relatives, but in fact they still wanted to sneak into the Northeast to make a living. I once asked a villager who had just boarded the train, "The mountains in Shandong are bare. Why don't you plant trees?" He said, "The mountains are not suitable for trees. They don't grow even if you plant them." The train arrived at Gushan. The mountains on the east side of the road are mixed with soil and rocks, and are full of cypresses that are only three or four feet tall, dripping with green. The villagers also caught a glimpse of them, and looked at each other in silence.</p>
<p>At dusk, I arrived in Jinan. Those boarding the train should wait outside the railing first to let those getting off come out slowly. Unexpectedly, when the railing door was opened, they rushed in, even tripping five or six women and children. The Chinese people's disregard for social order can be seen everywhere. Jinan City is at the intersection of the Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways. Industry, commerce, and education are all quite developed. The famous scenic spots are Qianfo Mountain, Daming Lake, and Baotu Spring. The others are Shun Jing, Qin Shubao's Former Residence, and the Provincial Library. When I was young, I read the lesson "Three Famous Jinan Attractions" in Chinese class. The teacher said that Qianfo Mountain was named because it has a thousand stone Buddhas. I traveled to Lishan (that is, Qianfo Mountain) in the past, and there was no such thing. This is just guessing the meaning of the name. Or it is said that "Qianfo" is the mispronunciation of the two characters "Xianfu." Every household in the city has spring water, and every household has weeping willows. Daming Lake is the confluence of the seventy-two springs, and the scenery is picturesque. Baotu Spring is the giant of the seventy-two springs. Spring water gushes from the bottom of the pool, bubbling and making a sound, turning out of the water surface, about two feet high. In the past, there were only three strands, but now artificial excavation has added six strands. Algae, moss, shrimp, and fish each have their own secluded charm, which is truly beyond description. The saying "Hearing is not as good as seeing with your own eyes" applies to these places.</p>
<p>Last night, the wind roared wildly, and I felt something touching the car window, making a slight sound like broken jade. When I woke up from a dream, in the faint morning light, I suddenly saw lights like electric torches in the distance, shining with ten thousand points, like exquisite and transparent crystal. The branches of the cypress trees were still covered with residual snow, looking like cotton. Those falling on the stone steps and rails were also piled up and had not melted. I looked closely at the station sign and knew that I had arrived in Tianjin. Because I wanted to contact the Changtu Bus Company in Tianjin to negotiate remittance matters, and the Shanghai-Ping train ticket I was holding was delayed in Beijing, and it had expired here, I got off the train and stayed at the Nan Kai Shuo You Lou.</p>
<h3 id="e73">A Glimpse of Xinjiang's Export Surplus <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin is the capital of Hebei Province and also one of the four major trading ports in China. Politically and economically, it is the center of North China. The Xin Sui Changtu Bus Company was founded in the winter of 1932. Although the main station is in Suiyuan, due to business and economic reasons, it has set up a head office in Tianjin. Mr. Zhu Xiting, the general manager, has a long-term vision and is well-planned. The initial capital was only 300,000 yuan, which has now been increased to one million yuan. I was introduced by three gentlemen, Gong Bicheng, Wang Luzhou, and Huang Jingwan, to visit and report the following information:</p>
<p>Xinjiang is isolated outside the border, and transportation is obstructed, making travel difficult, resulting in hidden resources that cannot be developed, and therefore culture and commerce are negatively affected. Therefore, the Xin Sui Changtu Bus Company was specially established to make travel to the border faster and to allow economic and cultural flow more easily. The company's capital was initially 300,000 yuan, and now it has been increased to 1 million yuan. The main station is located in the provincial capital of Suiyuan, and branch stations are located in Ulan Aili Gen, Hami, Guchengzi, and Dihua. The entire line is 5,980 li long (2,917 kilometers), with a total of 72 large and small stations. In addition to the main and branch stations, there are 8 rest stations and 12 gas stations. Regarding the support of Northwest cultural undertakings: (1) The company is willing to contribute one-tenth of its annual profit as a Northwest education fund, which will be used exclusively to subsidize Northwest students studying in the interior, regardless of ethnicity, and with equal treatment. However, recently it is only temporarily applicable to students from Xinjiang. When the fund increases, it will be extended to students from Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Inner Mongolia. (2) The company offers special low prices for transporting cultural items to Xinjiang, such as school books and newspapers. (3) Students from the new province coming to the interior to study receive half price on the bus, and the poor are completely free. (4) Those hired to go to Xinjiang to run education are also exempt from bus fare. It is expected that this road will be the first shortcut for the interior to enter Xinjiang. If there is no obstacle from war, the business can be developed day by day in the only necessary traffic sense. However, the company has no monopoly idea. In the future, after a certain period of time, the government's strength can take care of this and can make the company without any sacrifice situation, the whole road is nationalized, its scale is expanded, and its management is improved. The effects achieved will be even greater. This is what we look forward to. Later, I discussed with them the remittance methods for this trip, and they enthusiastically supported and resolved the good method, which was very gratifying. They also introduced the person in charge of statistics of the company to tell the main amount of import and export of Xinjiang in recent years. A brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>A. The main products of Xinjiang, the amount of annual transportation to Suiyuan and export to Tianjin, are 3 million sheep intestines, with a total price of 2.4 million yuan; 150,000 pieces of lambskin, 750,000 yuan; 64,000 pieces of Kuqa black lambskin, 224,000 yuan; 20,000 pieces of Gucheng black lambskin, 26,000 yuan; 450,000 pieces of oily otter skin, 400,500 yuan; 30,000 fox skins, 270,000 yuan; 4,000 wolf skins, 48,000 yuan; 300 sable skins, 13,500 yuan; 700 snow sweep skins, 28,000 yuan; 30,000 gray squirrel skins, 24,000 yuan; 1,200 lynx skins, 21,600 yuan; 25,000 wild cat skins, 37,500 yuan; 3,000 wild monkey skins, 1,500 yuan; 22,000 pairs of fox legs, 17,600 yuan; 4,000 catties of deer antler, 80,000 yuan; 450 catties of antelope horn, 270,000 yuan. A total of 16 kinds, with a total price of 4.6167 million yuan. The above items are based on the investigation of the camel transportation era. In the future, when cars pass, they can all be suitable for transportation, and the amount can be increased sharply.</p>
<p>B. In addition, the main products of Xinjiang are still exported from the A route, and there are still only camel transportable ones, which are 120,000 catties of horse mane and horse tail, with a total price of 84,000 yuan; 45,000 pieces of Baha white lambskin, 40,500 yuan; 30,000 pieces of Kuqa white lambskin, 24,000 yuan; 22,000 pieces of Gucheng white lambskin, 19,200 yuan; 64,000 pieces of Kazakh red lambskin, 25,600 yuan; 2,500 pieces of blue sheepskin, 2,500 yuan; 14,000 pieces of goat board skin, 4,200 yuan; 3,000 pieces of dog skin, 5,100 yuan; 250,000 catties of camel hair, 125,000 yuan; 220,000 catties of American grain cotton, 36,000 yuan; 820,000 catties of white wool, 16,400 yuan; 1.15 million catties of miscellaneous wool, 172,500 yuan; 4,000 catties of dried deer antler, 2,000 yuan; 180,000 catties of raisins, 54,000 yuan; 65 million fritillaria bulbs, 13,000 yuan; 13,000 catties of wolfberry, 4,200 yuan; 20,000 catties of mushrooms, 18,000 yuan; 24,000 pieces of white fortunate sheepskin, 36,000 yuan. A total of 18 kinds, with a total price of 682,200 yuan.</p>
<p>The number of main products exported from Xinjiang in the above two items, A and B, is based on the survey during the worst period of the market in 19, 20, 21, and 3 years. It is found that the export amount of fritillaria bulbs, wolfberry, and mushrooms in the two most prosperous periods of 16 and 17 years would exceed more than ten times the current amount. Others such as fur, cotton, raisins, etc., the amount of exports to the Suiyuan area each year has decreased by more than 80% compared to the past. Its economic panic and price drop everywhere every year, the stagnation of exports, is indeed not without influence, but its main reason is that since the completion of the Soviet Union's Tuxi Railway, it has surrounded Xinjiang for thousands of miles, bordering my border everywhere, and transportation is extremely convenient. Therefore, for Xinjiang, it is not only regarded as the only market for finished products, but also recognized as a sufficient supply of raw materials. Year after year, various economic aggression attempts are carried out without any effort, and it is worth it that the internal disorder in the new province is frequent, and the eastern transportation is cut off, giving it an excellent opportunity. Therefore, at this moment, the export of raw material products and the import of finished products in the new province have been completely manipulated by the Soviet Union. It is a pity that if the Chinese people do not cooperate and catch up quickly, so that the northwest traffic will become more and more developed, so as to recover the rights that have been lost, then the future is hidden, and the square is booming.</p>
<p>The main prices of goods transported from Tianjin and Suiyuan to Xinjiang each year are 760,000 yuan for cigarettes, 68,800 yuan for high-quality wool, 35,750 yuan for medium-quality wool, 126,000 yuan for ordinary silk, 97,600 yuan for second-class silk, 285,200 yuan for linen silk piece, 93,000 yuan for cotton velvet, 31,600 yuan for medium-sized western medicine, 28,080 yuan for domestic pills and powder, 3,000 yuan for ordinary stationery, 6,800 yuan for leather finished products, 99,000 yuan for shoes, hats and clothing, 14,100 yuan for medium-sized cosmetics, 60,000 yuan for books and printed products, 10,400 yuan for wool yarn and finished products, 4,800 yuan for silk velvet and finished products (the above can be applied to car transport), 460,000 yuan for rice heart tea, 200,800 yuan for black tea, 195,000 yuan for San Jiu Da tea, 3,200 yuan for Longjing fragrant tea, 2,652 yuan for Pu'er tea, 6,720 yuan for Han smoke, 42,000 yuan for second-class cigarettes, 12,000 yuan for blue market cloth, 27,500 yuan for coarse and fine medicinal materials, 7,800 yuan for second-class pills and powder, 21,350 yuan for second-class western medicine, 14,250 yuan for second-class cosmetics, 1,200 yuan for inks and paints, 2,160 yuan for hardware, 4,100 yuan for seafood, 3,200 yuan for fine paper, 1,560 yuan for domestic fine porcelain, 4,500 yuan for domestic pens and inks, 2,240 yuan for domestic decorations. The total price of imports by the new province from the Xin Sui Road each year in the past three years averaged 2,726,562 yuan. Compared with the annual total export amount of 5,244,900 yuan at the same time on the same road, the annual export surplus is 2,518,338 yuan.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is rich in products, and the above surplus figures can already be seen. In the past, before the construction of the Tuxi Railway, the figures should be even greater. Since the construction of the road was successful, the above imported goods, except for cigarettes, tea, wool, silk, books, and Chinese medicine, are not much different from the past, and other goods have been greatly crowded out by Russian goods, and are declining day by day, even more than 70%. In addition, such as kerosene, gasoline, candles, matches, sugar, steel, hardware, cotton cloth, plain cloth, porcelain, glass, etc., the amount of large goods with a locked amount of several million yuan per year has now been completely replaced by Russian goods. From this, the great economic power of the Soviet Union in the new field can be seen, but it is all due to the convenience of transportation.</p>

<p>——Liu Xiang Orders All Roads to Rapidly Join Forces——</p>
<p>——Wanyuan Broadsword Team Drives Bandits Out of the City——</p>
<p>Chengdu Dispatch: The five-route army of bandits continued to launch a general offensive on all fronts on March 22. There have been fierce battles in recent days. The Zhou Brigade of the Fan Shaoxeng Department on the left wing attacked the Banmiao area of Wangjiaping and the Wangjingshan bandit positions, repeatedly breaking through five layers of bandit fortifications. The bandits still stubbornly resisted on the top of the mountain. After Fan's division repeatedly defended the front more than ten times, they finally defeated the bandits. Hao and Gao's regiments and the machine gun special branch battalions also joined the battle, and finally attacked and captured Gancao Ya, Baizuizi, Hongyanzi, and other places. The Liao and Fan brigades and the Zeng and Xu regiments have made varying progress of thirty to fifty li after fierce battles in recent days. In these few days, Fan's division suffered more than ten casualties of battalion, company, and platoon leaders, and more than seven hundred soldiers, which was an unprecedented fierce battle since the bandit suppression by the division. About two thousand eight or nine hundred bandits died, leaving hundreds of corpses. Fan's division also captured more than three hundred bandit guns. On the morning of the 26th, after several fierce battles, the government troops made progress again and again, and recaptured Xijiguan Mountain, Exiangjing, Hongyan, Chenghuangmiao, and other places. That night, there was a strong wind and rain. The bandits took the opportunity to counterattack the new positions of the five-route army. The Rao Brigade, Yang Brigade, and Liu Brigade on the right wing took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, causing great chaos in the bandit group, and recaptured the important barrier of Baihezai Mountain. The Rao and Yang brigades tracked and extended the advance, and searched and attacked the Huangjiazhai area via Liulinning and Shiban. The Luo Zezhou department of the three routes captured Zaolin. Liu Xiang ordered the first and second routes to attack Changchi from both sides. This place is the gateway to Nanjiang and the location of the bandit's arsenal. Therefore, to take Nanjiang, we must first get this place, and then we can have no worries. After the four-route Yang army captured Jiangkou, the bandits on the opposite side are now retreating to Zhanggongqiao. The bandits in Wanyuan, because of excessive oppression of the people, the people could not bear their abuse, and secretly formed a broadsword team of more than a thousand people. On the 23rd, after a night of fierce fighting, the bandits could not support it, were driven out of the city, and retreated to the back of the mountain five miles outside the city. They are still confronting each other.</p>
<p>After the Sichuan bandits were recaptured by the government troops in Bazhong, their momentum became more and more constrained. According to the captured bandits, the bandit leaders Xu Xiangqian, Chen Changhao, Zhang Guotao, and others were very panicked and decided to concentrate the bandit forces and fight the five-route army for the last time, hoping to break through. If this plan fails, they will flee to Shaanxi and Hubei. At this moment, Liu Xiang's third phase plan has been roughly ordered by telegraph on the 24th to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth route armies to advance side by side and fiercely attack Tongnan to take the general encirclement to destroy them all in one fell swoop. At the same time, he also telegraphed Chairman Jiang and the Military Commission, asking them to order the troops stationed on the border of Shaanxi and Hubei to intercept them. The original text is as follows: "Nanchang Chairman Jiang, Nanjing Military Commission, Repeatedly according to information from all parties, after Deng's department conquered Mumen and Luo's department conquered Bazhong, it is enough to prove that the main force of the bandits has been glued to the Zi Xuan Sui area. It is urgent to jointly suppress the Tong Jiang Nanjiang and destroy the bandits as soon as possible to relieve the central government's worries about the west. In addition to ordering Deng and Tian to jointly attack Nanjiang, and Li, Luo, Yang, Fan, and Tang to jointly attack Tongjiang, I sincerely ask you to order the troops stationed on the border of Shaanxi and Hubei to intercept them to avoid escape. I respectfully report this, and I humbly</p>

<p>——Construction of Hot Spring Bathhouse——</p>
<p>——Arranging Memorial Arches and Pavilions——</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Huangshan in southern Anhui, the peaks and ridges are majestic and beautiful, and the springs and stones are clear and cold. There are thirty-six peaks and seventy-five springs, and the Tiandu, Lianhua, and other peaks, waterfalls, cinnabar, and other springs are especially delicious. However, due to traffic obstructions, there are few traces of travel, resulting in natural scenery being greatly affected, and cannot compete with Kuanglu and Mogan for male superiority. The two highways, Hangzhou, Huizhou, Wuhu, and Tunxi, have recently been completed and opened to traffic. Now, the Yintun Road is being added to the station. The route is from Tunxi around Huangshan, through Taiping, to Qingyang Jiuhua Mountain, to reach Guichi Yin Jiahui. It is currently being rushed to repair the section from Xiuning to the foot of Huangshan. It was previously proposed to the provincial government's regular meeting to decide to organize the Huangshan Construction Committee, so that Huangshan can be designed and developed, and the draft Huangshan construction plan has been drafted, and letters have been sent to famous figures in Anhui, requesting donations to build it, and because the traffic tour of the five southeastern provinces will be held soon, and it has been planned to visit Huangshan, it has ordered the Highway Bureau to merge the highway from Shexian to Huangshan into the Yintun Road, surveying and rushing to repair it. Other such as the construction of hot spring bathhouses, the arrangement of memorial arches and pavilions at various scenic spots, should be completed as soon as possible to avoid temporary urgency. A proposal was submitted to the provincial government's regular meeting on the 30th, requesting that 5,000 yuan be allocated from the 100,000 yuan of the road construction public bond in southern Anhui and handed over to Liu Bingcui, the administrative inspector of the tenth district and the county magistrate of Xiuning, to be responsible for handling it nearby (March 30).</p>
<p>I beg your perusal, your official Liu Xiang respectfully kowtows," Liu also expressed to others that he will join the central army and the Shaanxi army to destroy Xu Bandit in the Sichuan territory and not let a bandit slip through the net. In addition, the bandit suppression headquarters here received a telegram from the Nanjing Military Commission on the 23rd on the 22nd to commend the bandit suppression soldiers. Liu Xiang has already sent a telegram to the various routes on the 24th to commend them. (National News Agency)</p>

<p>Detailed Record of a Suicide Case Involving a Shooting of a Beloved Concubine</p>
<p>Recently, incidents of tragedies arising from love affairs have been frequently reported. Last night (31st) at around twelve o'clock, a tragic case of shooting a newly acquired concubine and suicide occurred involving Shi Shouhai, also known as Jinguan, the son of Shi Zhirui, the manager of the Songjiang Salt Office. The incident shocked the neighborhood, and onlookers blocked the streets. Shi Shouhai, aged twenty-one, came from a wealthy family in Jiantingshan, enjoying a life of luxury and indulgence. With a violent temper, he habitually carried a four-inch pistol, embodying the image of a pampered young master. Last year, he married a woman from the Xi family, who gave birth to a son this year, only three months old and still in swaddling clothes. Shouhai spent his days indulging in pleasure, frequenting brothels in Shanghai's Xiaohua Garden. He redeemed a prostitute named Baolian Laoqi for 5,600 yuan and brought her back on the 29th of last month, establishing a luxurious residence for her in Zhang Zhong's house south of Jiangjing Bridge in the city. Yesterday, he sent a fast letter to Shanghai, inviting two young ladies, Nie Qiaozhu and Liu Bin'yun, to Songjiang. He originally planned to accompany them to Hangzhou for sightseeing today. Last night, after returning home from watching a play, Laoqi slept on half of the bed in the upstairs room with Nie and Liu, heads together. Shouhai was working on writing at his desk. When Laoqi went to sleep, she had a slight argument with Shouhai. After finishing his writing, Shouhai undressed, intending to sleep in the outer厢樓 room. The carter, Zhang Jinting, suddenly heard a gunshot, followed by another in quick succession. Upon going upstairs to investigate, he found that Laoqi had already passed away, a bullet having entered through the left side of her nose. Shouhai was rolling around on the floor under the bed. He called for Zhang to help him up. Zhang and the two women were terrified and went downstairs to call for help. Then, Shi fired another shot, ending his life, lying sideways on the floor. One bullet was in the left side of his head, and another in his chest. The two female friends, in extreme panic, ran out naked and reported to the police officer on duty, who reported to the Public Security Bureau. Inspector Zhou of the Wu Patrol was the first to arrive at the scene for investigation. Three suicide notes were found in the overcoat that the deceased had taken off: one to his father, Shi Zhirui, vaguely expressing regret for redeeming a prostitute; one to his brother-in-law, entrusting him to take care of the family; and one to the prosecutor, stating that the incident was out of necessity and had nothing to do with others, requesting that it not be investigated further. This afternoon at two o'clock, Prosecutor Meng, upon receiving the report, rushed to the scene with Forensic Examiner Wang and bailiff Chen Rong for investigation. It was verified that the woman, Baolian Laoqi, had been shot, and three suicide notes were found, which her father confirmed to be her handwriting. The official ordered the town police to collect the body of the woman, Baolian Laoqi, and the gold necklace and heart-shaped pendant she wore were placed on file in the court. The female friends, Nie Qiaozhu and Liu Bin'yun, and the carter, Zhang Jinting, were taken to the Bureau and transferred to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation and handling. It was discovered that one bullet remained in the chamber of the pistol. According to reports, several days ago, Shouhai had demanded 6,000 yuan from the accounting office of the Songjiang Salt Office. The accounting office initially refused to pay, and Shouhai fired a shot, which penetrated the glass window. Upon seeing this, the accounting office opened the iron safe, took out a passbook, and withdrew 6,000 yuan to go to Shanghai to hire the prostitute. It is calculated that this pistol had fired four bullets, which is consistent with the one remaining in the chamber. However, the reasons for his death are varied, and no one is certain. Currently, the body of Shi Shouhai is being prepared for burial by his family today.</p>

<p>Jiangbei Bandit Yang Da Captured</p>
<p>Yang Da, a notorious bandit who had repeatedly committed major robbery cases in various counties of Jiangbei's Yancheng and Funing, was previously involved in organizing a robbery of the Changzhou Ban Junlong steamer last year and killing someone in prison. The Second District of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team had already apprehended accomplices Hua Kuailiu Mazi and Chen Xiao Erzi, recovering two firearms. All confessed that Yang Da was the leader. Approval was immediately obtained from the provincial authorities to execute them by firing squad. It has now come to light that Team Leader Li Xiaotang of the Second Team of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team stationed in Qingpu noticed that robbery cases have been occurring frequently in the eastern part of the county recently, with few arrests, and that the bandits involved often speak with a Jiangbei accent. He previously purchased a tracking line to apprehend them and, as a result, apprehended the notorious bandit Yang Da in Anzhuang, the second district. However, the criminal's testimony was cunning, denying any crimes in Qingpu. Therefore, Team Leader Li immediately transferred the criminal to the Second District Headquarters of the Provincial Public Security Team for further investigation.</p>

<p>Tragedy Occurs During Play Performance</p>
<p>Recently, a Jiangbei opera troupe came to perform in Tianzhuang Town in the county. On the night of the 30th, dozens of villagers from nearby Hudian Township went to the performance intending to enter without paying for tickets, leading to a conflict between the two sides. After the performance, Zhou Lin, Qian Jinhe, and others dragged eight leaders of the opera troupe to West Street and beat them, also stabbing them in the neck, hands, and feet with bayonets. They then left. The eight were unconscious after being stabbed. People sent them to a trauma clinic and reported the incident to the local Public Security Bureau. The next day, the murderers Chen Yuanyuan, Chen Gaosheng, Jing Guansheng, Qian Jinhe, Zhou Lin, and others were arrested and sent to the county government for interrogation. According to their statements, they had prior grudges against the eight. They were immediately detained. The eight opera leaders have been sent to the Yuhe Hospital in the city, and their lives are in danger.</p>

<p>Wuxi Women's Circle Expresses Sympathy to Li Shuyun</p>
<p>Since the Liu Zhuomin case occurred, involving Li Shuyun, wife of Gu Renfa, the Commissioner of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province, and her mother, Liu, the arrest and escort for interrogation in Wuxi has caused a national sensation, attracting attention from all levels of society. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It has come to light that the women's circle in this county has unanimously expressed indignation at the arrest of Ms. Li and her mother, and has organized a delegation to express sympathy to Shuyun and voice support. Yesterday (1st) at 2:00 PM, delegation members Xu Jingxia, Sun Manshi, Guo Mohe, and 36 others gathered at the Education Association in the city and departed to the detention center to express sympathy, bringing biscuits, oranges, and other items as gifts. Upon arriving at the detention center, Warden Sun Gongwu declined the meeting and visit due to regulations. After repeated negotiations, they were finally allowed to enter. At that time, Li Shuyun and her mother were already waiting outside the cell gate. Upon seeing the delegation, they couldn't help but shed tears of emotion. The delegation presented the biscuits and other gifts, which Shuyun repeatedly declined, expressing gratitude and shame. The delegation then inquired about the details of the case. Shuyun said that she discovered Gu Renfa's bigamy one month before the Liu case occurred, so it was completely separate from the Liu case. Now, Renfa has consistently failed to provide concrete evidence, only resorting to evasive tactics. Now, she only asks the court to quickly summon Gu Renfa to appear in court for confrontation, so that the truth can be revealed. She also implored everyone to uphold justice and voice support, and requested them to telegraphically request Chairman Chen of Jiangsu Province to quickly order Gu Renfa to come to Wuxi for confrontation. While speaking, she sobbed uncontrollably. Her mother, Liu, also burst into tears beside her, moving those who heard. Afterwards, the delegation withdrew from the detention center, returned to the Education Association, and convened a meeting. All members attended, and Xu Jingxia was publicly elected as chairman and Sun Manshi as secretary. The proceedings followed due protocol. It was resolved that (1) the association would be named the Wuxi New Life Movement Women's Promotion Association Preparatory Committee Gu Li Shuyun Sympathy Delegation; (2) Xu Jingxia and Sun Wan were nominated to draft a telegram to request Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Chen to quickly order Gu Renfa to come to Wuxi for confrontation to clarify the truth, and the telegram would be sent tomorrow (today); (3) Xu Jingxia, Sun Wan, Tang Lanyue, and Gu Yu were nominated to visit the detention center at least once every week to express sympathy. The meeting adjourned, and the preparatory meeting of the Wuxi New Life Movement Women's Promotion Association continued. Sun Manshi, Xu Jingxia, Lu Jingxia, Zhang Wenying, Tang Lanyue, Wu Shan, Guo Mohe, Chen Shouying, Gu Yu, and others were nominated as preparatory committee members.

<p>The Ninth Team of the Second District of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team stationed in Wuxi received a confidential report the day before yesterday evening stating that several robbers, including Mei Zhenjun, who had robbed boats traveling between Suzhou and Wuxi were hiding in Chen Baitou Lane. Upon receiving the report, Team Leader Zhang dispatched team members to make arrests. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already fled upon hearing the news, so they turned back to return to the team. While passing by the railway tracks next to the railway station, they happened to run into Mei Zhenjun and apprehended him. They also captured accomplices Yang Yousan, Li Chunxiang, Zhang Liantang, and three others in the Huasheng Alley of Nancangmen and brought them back to the team for strict interrogation. The bandits confessed to robbing boats traveling between Suzhou and Wuxi and admitted to committing two robberies in Gaoqiao and Meicun around October of last year according to the lunar calendar. After verifying the confession, Team Leader Zhang submitted them to the Second District Headquarters for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<p>Chen Sanlang, a bandit who burned and robbed Wang Xiaoda's family in Wangjiaba, the second district, was apprehended two years ago and detained in prison. Before a verdict was reached, Chen disrupted the peace and forcibly robbed Bao Dong Zhao Shouzhang of silver dollars in prison last month.

Those who attended yesterday were leaders from all walks of life in the city. They all took off their hats and sat solemnly and quietly upon entering the venue, and they were full of energy. Before 10:00 AM, representatives from all walks of life had already gathered, and they adhered to the schedule. This has been rare in various meetings in the past.

<h3 id="e89">Chairman's Report <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>After following the proper protocol, Chairman Wu Tiecheng gave a report, stating that since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, all parts of the country have responded successively. Shanghai occupies an important position in the country. Therefore, the Party, government, and military organs have devoted themselves to the preparation of the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association in two weeks. Today, the inaugural meeting is held, and in the future, the work of the New Life Movement will be promoted by the officials selected by the meeting. The name of the Promotion Association, as the words explain, is to promote the realization of the New Life Movement, and its purpose should be to seek its universal implementation. Therefore, the initiators must set an example by implementing it themselves first and serve as a model for the people in order to refresh the public's perception and achieve practical success. Shanghai is the largest port in China. The content of all its social economy and politics is very complex. The population is more than 3 million, which is attached to the vision of the country. Therefore, the need for the New Life Movement goes without saying. However, under these circumstances, how should it be implemented and how should it be universally implemented? It all depends on the work outline planned in the future and the officials elected by the meeting to work hard to achieve it.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Representative Speeches <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Following that, Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, saying that today, the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association is holding its inaugural meeting, and he, on behalf of the Municipal Party Department, is offering his opinions. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek initiated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, it has been less than three days, and all parts of the country have been shrouded in this atmosphere, either already implementing it or preparing for it. This movement has been able to be promoted universally for a reason. The occurrence of a movement is not accidental, and its popularity cannot be forced. For example, during the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1926, who would have expected that the province of Guangdong and a small number of troops could unify the country? At that time, the people were oppressed by the Northern Warlords and sought liberation, so the National Revolution was able to meet the needs of society and create a universal revolutionary atmosphere to promote its success. On the other hand, although the Communist Party also shouted at the top of its lungs to promote communism, it was not adapted to the needs of society, so it has been declining and gradually dying out. The success or failure of a movement depends on whether the initiator has accurately grasped the needs of the guarding association and whether it is suitable for society. Now that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is advocating the New Life Movement at this time, its importance is no less than that of the National Revolutionary Movement at that time. Now that politics has achieved considerable success, it is necessary to go deeper into society to consolidate the foundation, and the New Life Movement is the movement to reform society. Pan elaborated further on the fact that Chiang Kai-shek's purpose in advocating the New Life Movement is to militarize the lives of the people, and that the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame all contain social trust, not just personal moral cultivation. He also explained that neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and frugality are easy ways to cultivate propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bar Association convened an extraordinary general meeting of members yesterday (Sunday) at the Lake Society on the second floor of the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road in the Public Concession to discuss the mandated revision of the association's articles of association and the restoration of the president's council system prior to 1927.

<h3 id="e108">Zhang Taiyan Gave a Text to Duan Shouwen <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Mr. Zhang Taiyan, a giant in Chinese studies, rarely writes occasional texts. Recently, he gave a congratulatory text to Duan of Hefei, concerning the perilous state of diplomacy and the situation in North China. He did not excessively praise Hefei but showed understanding for the government. The original draft is disclosed below. In the year following the Japanese occupation of Rehe, Duan Gong of Hefei turned seventy. On March 23rd, on the birthday of Xia Zhengzhi Gong, he intended to raise a glass to celebrate, but Gong said that it was not the time for celebration when the country was in difficulty. Therefore, Zhang Binglin of Yuhang said, "What I see in Gong is not to carve ornate words for flattery, but to want Gong to take on the difficult tasks. The noble man rushes to help when sick and yields to barbarians. Gong should not retreat." Gong declined but could not avoid it, so he agreed. Judging by Gong's lifelong actions, commentators worry about differences, but he cannot be different from the beginning to the end of the Republic of China. The achievements of recreating the republic are known to everyone. Since the Liaoshen Incident, the military has miscalculated in the front. After three years of intrusion, half of northern China has fallen, and northern China is bordering on enemies, with only the Great Wall as the boundary. The danger is like stacked chess pieces. What people are fortunate to rely on is the battle between the Soviet Union and Japan. If the north wins, China will be lucky to be partially preserved, but it will not be able to recover the lost land. If the east wins, everything in Hebei will fall to Xiaotian. The current situation is not like the Jin and Song Dynasties, which can prolong life on the left bank of the Yangtze River. Those who are wise and above consider this dangerous. Those who are with the Republic of China from beginning to end, like Gong, should take this into account. Gong also advocated friendship with Japan at first, but</p>
<p>He was not willing to cede territory to please them. After the three provinces fell, the Easterners used good words to seduce Gong, but Gong resisted. The beginning of not wanting to rely on pride to provoke anger is the way of neighboring countries. The end of meeting with a righteous attitude is the righteousness of the country. A few months after the fall of Kanto, Binglin was in Tianjin and discussed matters with Gong calmly. Gong often lamented that people's feelings were intolerant. Outer Mongolia had already sent a loan, but it was lost due to internal military constraints. During the conversation, he looked sad. If Gong's plan had not been thwarted, both northern and southern Mongolia would be listed as giant towns, supporting the three eastern provinces. If the three provinces were unfortunately lost, Rehe would not move. This is Gong's most far-sighted plan, and it should be lamented now. Before the water is breached, a ball of mud is enough to block it. After it has been breached, carrying soil and setting stones day and night is still not enough.</p>
<p>Kill the minority. What is expected of Gong now is not to recover all the lost land immediately, but to ensure that the enemy cannot arbitrarily trample within the Great Wall. Chahar and Suiyuan are self-sufficient in soldiers and should always be guarded by China. This was easy in the past, but now it is impossible to sit and look forward to it without ten times the strength. Who should be assigned to the difficult task other than Gong? Last year, when Japan occupied Rehe, it coincided with Gong's birthday. Gong heard of it and vomited blood, and he was almost unable to support it. Now the fire has changed</p>

The plane arrived at Majiang at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and plans to return to Shanghai this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Departure Situation <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Jiang Feng seaplane is testing the speed of long-distance flights and the ability to fly in the sky. Therefore, it is test-flying to Fuzhou. It was originally scheduled to depart on the morning of the 31st. Later, due to the fog, the departure was postponed. Yesterday morning, the weather was clear. At 8:00, Coach Xu Chengqi first inspected the plane at the Longhua Airport and added gasoline. At 9:00 AM, he drove off. Zeng Yijing and senior officials in the Aircraft Department were at the scene to see him off.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Arrived in Fujian in the Afternoon <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Jiang Feng plane's route to Fuzhou flew along the coastline, passing through Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places. It circled several times for about 15 minutes each time to attract public attention before slowly heading southeast. Not long after, a telegram was received from the plane stating that it had landed in Ningbo at 10:15 AM to refuel and left Ningbo at 10:55 AM to advance to Wenzhou. Director Zeng received a telegram from Fujian last night stating that the Jiang Feng plane arrived in Majiang at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. After Coach Xu immediately visited Li Shijia, the commander of the Majiang naval port, he entered the city to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Returning to Shanghai Today or Tomorrow <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Feng's plane is in Fuzhou, scheduled for a one-night stopover. Weather permitting, he plans to depart Fujian this morning and fly back to Shanghai. He is expected to arrive at Gaochang Temple around 2:00 PM today. After returning to Shanghai, he will prepare for long-distance flights to Guangzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, and other locations. Zeng Yijing, Director of the Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau, is also expected to accompany Xu Chengqi on these flights.</p>
<p>Ah, while you are fortunately healthy, the past is a confused jumble; it is probably impossible to revisit. The future, fortunately, you take on with full strength. In the past, Guo Fenyang made great contributions to the Tang Dynasty, but was slandered by villains, removed and lived at home. In the Qing Dynasty, Li Suyi was dismissed from his post after a military defeat and spent three years in the Xianliang Temple. When the Tibetans invaded the capital, the emperor fled to Shaanxi, and eventually relied on Fenyang to save him. When the Eight-Nation Alliance captured Beijing, it also relied on Suyi to help with support, so they could negotiate. Although they paid a large amount of tribute, there was no humiliation of ceding land. Today, your situation is no more than like Guo and Li, and your innate magnanimity and stability are similar to Fenyang, while Suyi is your hometown predecessor, and you have always heard of his style. If Heaven does not destroy China, even if there are suspicious and cruel people who try to sting you in every possible way, they will ultimately be unable to suppress you from rising. Binglin wishes for China, so he must wish this to you. "Wishing for choking has words," is the ancient system, so I write this as a preface.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Municipal Land Bureau Limits Gaogiao Concealed Reclamation, Each Household to Report <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Deadline is the End of April This Year</p>
<p>Those Who Fail to Report by the Deadline Will Be Strictly Punished</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, in order to comply with the order to rectify the coastal sandbanks of Gaoqiao, hereby announces to all households engaged in concealed reclamation that they must come to the bureau to report in detail before the end of April. The original text is as follows: It is hereby ordered by the Municipal Government, in accordance with the notification from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, regarding the coastal sandbanks of Gaoqiao, as reported by the Shangbao Sand Field Official Property Bureau, that the concealed reclamation households are reaping the benefits, etc., and requesting investigation and handling. As it concerns public income, detailed investigation and practical handling are required, and a report is to be submitted, etc. It is our duty to comply. Upon investigation, the coastal sandbanks of Gaoqiao originally belonged to public land. Except for those coastal households who previously obtained property certificates from the state and local administrative organs, and have paid grain taxes, which should be recognized as their property, those who have reclaimed and cultivated privately without any documents are considered to be engaged in concealed reclamation. For the sake of rectification, we hereby issue a notice to inform all relevant property owners that if there are any cases of concealed reclamation, they must, before the end of April this year, submit a written statement to this bureau, stating the location, boundaries, and area of the concealed land, and attaching a sketch map. After measurement, those that are found to be not obstructive to the embankment will be allowed to pay the price and increase the grain tax for management. Those who conceal and fail to report beyond the deadline will be strictly punished in the future. Do not delay and mislead yourselves. This notice.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Provisional Meeting of the Lake Society Executive Committee <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM on April 1st, the Lake Society convened a second provisional meeting of the Executive Committee to discuss issues such as the restoration of the Huzhou Guild Hall and the construction of the Huzhou Middle School building. In the afternoon of the same day, a banquet was held at the Guild Hall for Huzhou fellow villagers. More than a dozen executive committee members including Wang Yiting, Chen Aishi, Shen Tianxin, Chen Guofu, Pan Gongzhan, and Yan Junyi, and more than a dozen fellow villagers including Wu Daquan, Zhang Danru, and Shen Zhongyi attended. The meeting issues are recorded below: (1) Restoration of the Huzhou Guild Hall: The Huzhou Guild Hall is located near the Shanghai North Railway Station in Zhabei. It was founded by prominent Huzhou merchants in Shanghai such as Yang Xinzhi, Zhu Wulou, and Shen Lianfang. The buildings were magnificent and large-scale. Since 1926, the buildings have been damaged due to being stationed by troops. During the Shanghai Battle in 1932, the Guild Hall was located in a strategic position and was often stationed by troops, resulting in it being bombed by the Japanese, destroying part of the buildings and mortuary. The damage is deeply regrettable. It is now planned to repair and restore it. (2) Construction of the Huzhou Middle School building: The Huzhou Shanghai Primary School has been established for more than twenty years and has a long history. However, due to financial limitations, the school does not have its own building. Since Mr. Yan Junyi became the principal, he has strengthened the rectification, and the school affairs have been progressing day by day, and the number of students has been increasing day by day. The rented private houses are sometimes insufficient for use, and the rent is extremely high, which is not economical. Therefore, it is planned to build a school building to expand. It is heard that the above two proposals have been fully approved by the Executive Committee, and Wang Yiting, Chen Lantu, Chen Guofu, Shen Tianxin, Shen Lianfang, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Daquan, Liu Zhengru, Pang Laichen, Zhang Danru, and others have been publicly elected as restoration committee members to be responsible for planning everything. In addition, the Lake Society on Guizhou Road originally had a three-story building. Recently, the society's affairs have been expanding day by day, and the original building is no longer sufficient. It is now planned to add another floor on the original site to add a dormitory for fellow villagers and a library for the vocational training school. It is heard that when the society was built, it was originally planned to have four floors, but due to insufficient funds, three floors were built first. Therefore, the foundation is very solid. Although another floor is being added now, it does not affect the original foundation at all, and the structural strength is sufficient to carry the load. It is heard that it has been decided to hand it over to the Standing Committee for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Xu Shiying Writes to Request Relief for Disaster Victims in Various Counties of Anhui Province <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Relief Has Not Been Organized for Refugees Who Fled Previously</p>
<p>These Refugees Have Been Fleeing for About Six Years</p>
<p>The great philanthropist Xu Shiying of this city wrote a letter to the Xinwei Relief Society yesterday to request relief for disaster victims in Lihuang and other places in western Anhui, saying: "Respected Sirs, the various counties in western Anhui have long been under bandit occupation and have been successively recovered by Chairman Liu of the Anhui Provincial Government leading troops to suppress the bandits. The refugees who have been moved out urgently need relief. A temporary immigration work team has been specially established, and Mr. Xu Xinxuan is invited to preside over it, and Zhang Zepu is retained to assist. Recently, Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhang telegraphed that the disaster victims were gathered in Lihuang Mapu, Yeji, and Kaishun Street. What I saw with my own eyes was tragic. It is estimated that there are more than 5,000 people in Lihuang, more than 2,000 people in Mapu, more than 3,000 people in Yeji, and 500 people in Kaishun. The reception facilities set up this time are all newly moved out from the front line. Relief has not been organized for refugees who fled previously. It has been about six years since these refugees fled. Apart from those who died due to hunger and disease and those who fled far away, who are not included, at the time of the army's encirclement and suppression, the time to clear the bandits seems to be after three or four months. The refugees are now exhausted and it is not easy to overcome this difficult situation. I sincerely pray that you will save people thoroughly and consult with the Red Cross Society Shi Zila, Wang Peila, Yu Qiala, Wen Lanla, Jixianhui Wang Yila, Huang Hanla, Li Shoushan, Zhu Shouchcheng, Feng Yangshan, Mr. Guang Jiong of the Buddhist Association Zhi, Qian Jinping, Huang Bodu, and gentlemen, and charitable organizations, to show great compassion and collect funds for relief. At the current price of grain, it seems that about two yuan per person can save these ten thousand lives. If you do not try your best to plead on their behalf, I am afraid that they will starve to death. I sincerely hope that you will consider it. I have long admired your association's commitment to saving people and your enthusiasm for relief. Over the years, the disaster areas in the province have repeatedly received your generous donations, either by sending personnel for disaster relief or by allocating funds for relief. The disaster victims have benefited greatly. I hope that you will consider the urgency of waiting after this disaster and raise a large sum of money to save the remaining people. Then, your kindness will be appreciated immeasurably. Apart from sending separate letters, I am writing to inform you accordingly. I hope you will check and reply."</p>

The Xuechi Soft Ni and Zhonghua Broadcloth produced by the Zhenyu Wool Textile Factory on Xujiahui Road in this city have been selling well in various ports for many years and have long been welcomed and used by all sectors of society. Gu Xiyuan, the general manager of the factory, is aware of the decline of China's rural economy and the fierce dumping of foreign goods. He knows that he must accelerate production, improve quality, and use foreign goods to counter foreign goods. In addition to studying and implementing plans, Mr. Gu has recently made great improvements in technology and health. He also has detailed plans for future products and is working hard to produce them. He is sparing no effort. It is heard that a large batch of incomparably cheap and beautiful silk wool fabrics from the factory has been launched on the market, so the business is becoming more and more developed.</p>

<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Hangzhou the night before yesterday, Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, accompanied by Wang Xiaolai and Liu Hongsheng, crossed the Huangpu River to visit various factories yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM. He returned to his residence at 5:00 PM in the afternoon and gave the following interview to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency:</p>
<p>[P Mission of this Trip</p>
<p>Mr. Shen said briefly that the mission of his trip south can be divided into three points: (1) Regarding political matters, administrative matters in various places, the promotion of local products and the reduction of tax rates, he has contacted the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways in Beijing, and the results are very satisfactory. (2) Contacting matters related to industry, commerce, and economy. (3) Visiting production and education matters, namely vocational education and social education.</p>

<p>In the midst of the global economic downturn, famous places are feeling the pinch. Qingdao is no exception, but fortunately, it has been handled properly, so it has not reached the point of exhaustion. Upon investigation, Qingdao's local products are mainly peanuts, followed by peanut oil. At present, the central government has approved the promotion of these products, such as the reduction of freight and the reduction of tax rates. The fact that local products are not unsalable means that the economy will not be exhausted.</p>

<p>After making political contacts in Nanjing, I went to Zhenjiang, Qishuyan, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and other places to visit industries. I arrived in Shanghai last night (the night before yesterday). This morning (yesterday morning), I was accompanied by Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Mr. Liu Hongsheng to visit the Zhonghua Match Factory, the Enamel Factory, the Zhanghua Woolen Mill, the Zhonghua Coal Ball Factory, the Cement Factory, and other places in Pudong. (Yesterday was Sunday, and all factories were closed. General Manager Liu Hongsheng specially ordered them to open for Shen to visit.) To learn from industry, on the one hand, to seek promotion for domestic goods (such as the previous domestic goods mobile exhibition, which was displayed in Qingdao for three weeks and sold goods worth 500,000 yuan), and on the other hand, to invest in Qingdao, which is what is meant by contacting matters related to industry, commerce, and economy.</p>

<p>As a result of today's visit, I feel that the above-mentioned factories run by Mr. Liu Hongsheng are well-organized and well-trained, and are good industries with scientific management.</p>

After a brief stay for three or two days, I will return to Qingdao. As for the report that Guo Binghe, Director of the Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Finance, came with me, although Director Guo is also in Shanghai at the same time, he has other important business and did not come with me.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Proposal to Improve Cigarette Tax System Presents Concrete Measures <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Tax Should Be Levied in Seven Grades in Accordance With Regulations</p>
<p>This Can Enrich the National Treasury and Benefit Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that 24 Chinese cigarette factories in this city, including the Minzhong Cigarette Company, have jointly petitioned the Yuan and Ministry to improve the current cigarette tax system, which is biased and unfair. The Tax Department has sent the original petition to the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association for review and reply. The association has also sent a letter to Huang Ziping of the original proposer Minzhong Cigarette Company, asking him to draft a practical proposal for discussion at the meeting. It is learned that Mr. Huang has replied to the association yesterday, proposing detailed measures, which are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e131">Reply to the Association <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Direct reply: I have received your letter and am aware of everything. Regarding the case of improving the tax rate, the members' meeting previously publicly elected Ziping and eight others as review committee members. They held a meeting and prepared a written opinion on the review of this case, which was sent by your association to the Tax Department for record. The original written opinion stated, "The Regulations on Unified Cigarette Tax were promulgated by the National Government. Article 3 of the regulations stipulates that all goods manufactured in the country should be graded according to the customs valuation standard, i.e., seven grades. The tax silver is calculated according to a percentage, i.e., tax is levied on value. The seven-grade system and the principle of levying tax on value were the same for the previous unified cigarette tax, the current customs duties, and the current cigar tax. It is better than the current arbitrary and mandatory cigarette tax, which has no standard. It is fair to pay 32.5 percent of the unified cigarette tax, because the customs valuation is the standard. What is currently requested from the government is to handle it in accordance with the effective Regulations on Unified Cigarette Tax promulgated by the government, without destroying the promulgated tax law. If it is said that the finances are stretched and additional funds must be raised, relief can be sought in the law and an appropriate increase can be made to 42.5 percent or 52.5 percent. How can the fair seven-grade tax system and the principle of levying tax on value be broken? I believe that if the government is prudent, it can organize a cigarette tax rate review committee, with several committee members from the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Tax Department, and several committee members elected by the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, to gather together for open discussion, so as to determine a perfect tax rate, which can meet the needs of the government in terms of finance, promote the development of the social economy, and adapt to the people's ability to bear it." These are my claims, which have been passed by a majority of the review committee members elected by the general meeting and sent by the association to the Tax Department. The iron case is like a mountain, and I do not need to propose another opinion. The case passed by a majority of the review committee members elected by the general meeting cannot be overthrown illegally by a minority. The Tax Department has not replied to this case for a long time. Your association, entrusted by the general meeting, should request the Tax Department to handle it quickly in accordance with the original written opinion in order to conform to public opinion. I am replying accordingly to your letter for your reference. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Zhabei Agricultural Exhibition Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Location Inside Liuying Road Charity Group</p>
<p>Exhibition for Two Days, Opened Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The agricultural product mobile exhibition sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Association, after holding the first exhibition at the Tongji University Seventh District Party Department in Jiangwan District, continued to hold the second exhibition yesterday (1st) inside the Zhabei District Charity Group. The exhibition date is scheduled for yesterday and today, and the opening ceremony was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. The grand occasion of the venue is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Participating Groups and Farmers <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Including Liu Xiusheng, representative of the Central Party Department, Zhang Huijun, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Zhu Hexiang, Pan Rongting, Lu Shikui, Xu Yunzhang, representatives of the Shanghai South District Farmers' Association, the registered primary schools in the district, Yongxing Primary School, Zhuye Primary School, Pingmin Training Institute, Zhabei Disaster-Stricken Industry and Commerce Federation, and farmers in Zhabei District, reaching more than 5,000 people.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Opening Ceremony of the Exhibition <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The ceremony was held at 1:00 PM. After the ceremony, the presidium members Yu Zhenhui, Feng Yixian, Zhao Zuolin, Shen Wenbin, Feng Xiancheng, etc. took their seats. Then Yu Zhenhui reported, saying: (1) The exhibition sponsored by the Municipal Agricultural Association has been held once in Jiangwan District, and this is the second time. (2) The exhibition sponsored by the Social Bureau has been held in Yangsi District one after another. The Municipal Agricultural Association is holding this exhibition in one or two districts that have not been exhibited. (3) It is hoped that participating farmers will pay attention to (A) new agricultural tools, (B) the improvement of agricultural seeds, (C) the improvement of various agricultural by-products. Then Liu Xiusheng, representative of the Central Party Department, gave a speech, saying that this agricultural exhibition is sponsored by the Municipal Agricultural Association. The Municipal Agricultural Association belongs to the Central Government and also belongs to the people. Therefore, the Central Government and the farmers should cooperate closely to seek the improvement of agricultural products in our country. He also hoped that the farmers who came to visit should pay attention to it, etc. Zhang Huijun, representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, saying that China is an agricultural country, so agriculture has a close relationship with the country and the people. At present, our country's agricultural products are not self-sufficient. Agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and cotton are imported and exceeded. The hidden worries of the economic downturn are lurking here. Therefore, we should abandon the attitude of sticking to old ways, change to scientific methods, and harvest abundantly. Increasing production is inevitable. I sincerely hope that you will all work hard after visiting, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Glimpse of Agricultural Products <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The agricultural products on display include agricultural tools, rice crops, cotton crops, pest specimens, insecticide specimens, horticultural seeds, fruit specimens, tea specimens, fishing and animal husbandry, wheat specimens, silkworm cocoons, beans, natural fertilizers, new agricultural tools, etc. from Daguju Farm.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Variety Show and Gifts <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>In order to increase the interest of the visiting public, the association has added a variety show. Yesterday's programs included silk and bamboo music, storytelling, magic, national art, new drama, singing and dancing (Miaomiao Troupe), movies, Changqiao film music, etc. In addition, today there are also Yonghe Industrial Company, Dachina Rubber Factory, Dechang Rubber Factory, etc., toothpaste, leather balls, running shoes, galoshes, various gifts, etc.</p>
<p>Also. Seeing the thoughtfulness of the equipment in each department, the generous treatment of workers, the tension of work, and the excellence of the products, it can indeed improve the status of domestic goods and replace some of the dumping of foreign goods. Moreover, the fact that the engineers are all Chinese is a special feature. Taking the Zhanghua Factory as an example, if you don't visit it in person, you can hardly believe that domestic goods also have such good wool fabrics.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Determining Principles <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Based on the seven-tier tax plan, the following two principles are combined: (A) The new tax rate tiers should follow Article 3 of the Cigarette Tax Regulations, using customs valuation as the standard, still divided into seven tiers. The selling price per carton is assumed to be the same as that set during the old seven-tier tax era. (B) The tax per carton under the new tax rate should follow the principle of ad valorem tax, assumed to be 52.5 percent. Based on the above two principles and referring to the 1929 tax rate table, a provisional new tax rate table is as follows: (1) Assuming the new tax rate table is for 50,000 cigarettes per carton, those with a registered selling price of 1,052 yuan or more will pay a first-tier tax of 653 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2.5 fen; those with a registered selling price of 714 yuan or more will pay a second-tier tax of 417 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7.5 fen; those with a registered selling price of 546 yuan or more will pay a third-tier tax of 299 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen; those with a registered selling price of 378 yuan or more will pay a fourth-tier tax of 220 yuan, 5 jiao; those with a registered selling price of 253 yuan or more will pay a fifth-tier tax of 149 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2.5 fen; those with a registered selling price of 125 yuan or more will pay a sixth-tier tax of 86 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2.5 fen; those with a registered selling price of less than 125 yuan will pay a seventh-tier tax of 47 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen. According to the above provisional new tax rate table, the products of Chinese merchants will generally fall under the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh tiers, with the sixth and seventh tiers being the most common. Therefore, the tax burden borne by Chinese merchants will mostly be over 86 yuan or over 47 yuan per carton, which is less than the current tax rate. British and American products, on the other hand, will cover all seven tiers, with some requiring a tax increase to over 650 yuan per carton, which is more than the current tax rate. According to this increase and decrease, based on the number of cigarette cartons sold in Shanghai in February, the increased burden on British and American companies is about 60,000 yuan. For Chinese merchants, those whose main business is high-end cigarettes will see an increase, while those whose main business is low-end cigarettes will see a decrease. For example, considering East China, the February sales of "20-pack Betel Nut" were 80 cartons, and "10-pack Anle" were 240 cartons, both of which can be changed to the seventh tier. If calculated using the provisional tax rate, the monthly tax paid will be about 10,000 yuan less than the current tax rate. Considering Central and South China, "10-pack Da Zhonghua" can be changed to the seventh tier, with monthly sales of 120 cartons. If calculated using the provisional tax rate, the monthly tax paid will be about 3,600 yuan less than the current tax rate. In this way, the tax on high-end cigarettes is increased, and the tax on low-end cigarettes is decreased. In terms of tax rate, it is consistently 52.5 per 100 in value, without any unfairness. The burden on Chinese merchants is reduced, so that they will not be oppressed by foreign merchants from the outside or encroached upon by smuggled cigarettes from the inside. The future of the cigarette industry will surely improve. Government tax revenue, based on the number of cigarette cartons sold in Shanghai in February, can also increase by more than 79,000 yuan. If extrapolated to the whole country, it will be even more considerable. If the cigarette tax is reduced, the cost will be lower, and smuggled cigarettes will have no opportunity to encroach, so tax revenue can be expected to improve even more. This tax rate benefits the government above, benefits Chinese merchants below, and benefits domestic tobacco farmers on the side. The tax rate is levied ad valorem, which is a common taxation principle, and is also clearly stipulated in the Cigarette Unified Tax Regulations. It is fair and impartial, and foreigners cannot use it as an excuse to oppose it. It is fair and easy to implement, and there is nothing better than this. It is believed that the quality of the tax rate is very important to the business. If all colleagues compare their products with the provisional tax rate and the current tax rate, they will realize the advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company, with the approval of the Municipal Council, is operating double-decker buses. One bus has now been installed, number 10132, and after passing the test run, it started running yesterday on Route 1 from Jing'an Temple to Gongyuan Bazichang, passing through Nanjing Road and other places. The fare for the lower level is the same as the regular Route 1 fare, but the second level is 4 copper coins more than the regular Route 1 fare (i.e., 4 coins per stop). As for the double-decker buses that have arrived, they will be put into operation as soon as they are installed. In addition, the fares for bus routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 10 have increased by 2 copper coins per stop from yesterday. However, bus routes 5, 6, 7, and 9 remain the same.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Association, in view of the rampant piracy offshore, which is destroying the fishing industry and causing great harm, has specifically submitted a document to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Commission, based on the resolution of the association's representative conference, ordering strict suppression to protect the industry. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e140">Hu Ganqing's Concubine Sues for Inheritance, Settlement Unsuccessful <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Hu Xue, with her daughter, came to court to demand inheritance.</p>
<p>The amount in dispute between the two sides is too far apart.</p>
<p>Hu Ganqing, a shareholder of Fuchang Ginseng Store in the South City and Hu Qingyutang Pharmacy in Beijing Road, Hangzhou, passed away in 1929, leaving behind several wives and concubines. Recently, Hu Xue, a concubine of Ganqing from Suzhou, hired lawyer Lu Dingkui to sue Ganqing's son, Shanqing, in the Civil Court of the First Special District, demanding the division of the estate, estimated at 300,000 yuan, one-third of which, etc. The court has held two trials, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong came to the Civil Court No. 6 to continue the hearing. Both parties appeared in person. The judge first asked whether a settlement had been attempted during the adjournment. According to the defendant's representatives, lawyers Lu Shaozong and Lin Yingqing, the plaintiff insisted on 30,000 yuan, while the defendant only offered several thousand yuan, resulting in</p>
<h3 id="e141">No Settlement <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, Hu Xue stated that due to the high cost of living, this small amount of several thousand yuan was not enough to cover expenses, and she was not deliberately extravagant. The court then advised both parties to make concessions and sought the defendant's opinion. The defendant, Hu Shanqing, said, "I have no obligation to support the plaintiff and am unwilling to make concessions." The court then instructed him, "Whether the plaintiff is your father's concubine or mistress, your father did support her while he was alive. Therefore, I am now advising you to increase the amount slightly so that a settlement can be reached." The defendant stated that he could offer at most 3,000 yuan, and could not add more. Since the plaintiff, Hu Xue, was unwilling to make concessions, a settlement was difficult to achieve, and the court began to</p>
<h3 id="e142">Proceed with the Trial <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to Hu Xue, she met Hu Ganqing around 1916 or 1917, and in 1918, she gave birth to a daughter named Qiaoyun, who is now 17 years old, at Wu Cui's house in Laohui Le Lane. At that time, Ganqing lived in Sanjiajian, and I could not come forward, so Hu instructed me to go to my mother's house in Suzhou temporarily, etc. In addition, Hu Shizhen, the son of Hu Shanqing, stated that he was 14 years old, lived in Jiuqu Lane, Hangzhou, and was currently studying in the first grade of Huilan Elementary School. The plaintiff was my grandfather's mistress and previously lived at No. 10 Xinglongfang, Chongqing Road. I have been there. Although I have seen her daughter, Qiaoyun, I do not know her. When my grandfather was seriously ill, the plaintiff came to my house and told me to</p>
<h3 id="e143">Come and Play <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>I took the opportunity to go, calling the plaintiff "Grandma" because she was older than my mother. After I went to Hangzhou, I sent a letter to the plaintiff, calling her "Concubine Grandmother." Because I was still young, I did not fully understand the proper terms of address and asked the Zhou family accountant next door. He told me to write "Concubine Grandmother." The court then gave him several letters to read. Shizhen replied that they were not written by him. He was then ordered to write numbers with a fountain pen for handwriting comparison. In addition, Hu Qiaoyun stated that she was 17 years old and studying in the first grade of junior high school at</p>
<h3 id="e144">Qiming Girls' School <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>in Xujiahui. Ganqing was my father. Since my father passed away, I have been to the old house on Guling Road and wore mourning clothes. I am now requesting a division of the estate because we are both children of the same father. According to current laws, all children have inheritance rights, etc. Subsequently, Gao Yangzhou, the assistant manager of Fuchang Ginseng Store, submitted the account books from 1929. According to Hu Xue, I had 3,000 yuan in silver, which I deposited in Xueji Yi in</p>
<h3 id="e145">Fuchang Ginseng Store <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>at the end of 1926. By the end of 1928, the store could not open the dividend account due to the large amount of money used under Hu Ganqing's account. Therefore, Ganqing consulted with me and borrowed my 3,000 yuan and 3,000 yuan each from Ganqing's other two concubines (both named Li) to offset the amount under Ganqing's account. In the nineteenth year, they gave me a passbook, etc. Judge Shen adjourned the case for further investigation and ordered Gao Yangzhou to bring the account books from 1926 to court at the next hearing on the afternoon of April 15. He also advised both parties to attempt a settlement during the adjournment.</p>

<p>Destroying the fishing industry, earnestly request strict suppression, in order to maintain maritime security and protect the livelihood of merchants and people. The members of our association all engage in offshore fishing. We usually lend money to fishermen to go fishing, and only when the fishing boats return can the loans be repaid. Fishing merchants and fishermen depend on each other. If there is a concern about the decline of fishing villages, then there is a concern about the collapse of the fish market. The situation has been fraught with difficulties for many years, and maritime bandits are rampant.</p>

<p>Have become havens for fugitives. It is not that there are no naval ships to protect the sea, and it is also the duty of specialized officers to arrest criminals. It is simply because</p>
<p>The soldiers are not well-trained for long, and the officials have no fixed responsibilities. They indulge in the habit of stealing and playing, and use their petty cleverness to allow the fish in the jar to transform into whales on the sea. Robbing ships is treated as a common occurrence. How can these small fishing families have the strength to resist? In recent years, coastal fishing villages have been on the verge of desolation, and the fish market has been affected, making it difficult to maintain. The cunning ones then</p>

<p>To sell Japanese fish, while the members of our association rely on a single, unyielding heart. In the midst of economic panic, they try their best to cope, but it is difficult to survive. We believe that fishing merchants and fishermen are all under the protection of the country, and your Excellency's concern for the suffering of our local area is understandable. The only solution is to combine all maritime anti-piracy agencies and place them directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy. Then, select specialized personnel to</p>

<p>Divide the coastal areas into several security zones based on the terrain, and allocate warships and personnel accordingly. The dens on land should be secretly investigated, and the havens at sea should be patrolled frequently. Then, the pirates' support will be exhausted and their reinforcements will be cut off. In just a few months, they can be eliminated. This will not only save the fishing merchants from the brink of extinction, but also strengthen national prestige in times of difficulty. We urgently submit our plea, hoping for your wise consideration and appropriate action. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Association.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Appeal Rejected in Jealousy and Adultery Case <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Jin Peifang Still Sentenced to Eight Years in Prison</p>
<p>Jin Peifang, a 20-year-old young man from Dongtai, was working as a shop assistant in a Westerner's home at No. 96 Verdun Garden, Albert Road, French Concession. He and Sheng Qinhuang, a 21-year-old Ningbo man who was also working as a butler, were jealous of each other because they both loved Chen Aqin, a maid who worked with them. On the morning of November 10 of the previous year, at around 3:00 AM, Jin took advantage of Sheng's sleep and used a wood-chopping knife to injure Sheng's head and pull out his testicles on both sides. Fortunately, the spermatic cords were not injured, and Sheng's life was saved. The police arrested Jin and sent him to the Second Special District Court, where he was prosecuted for attempted murder. After a trial, Jin was found guilty of intentionally causing serious injury and sentenced to eight years in prison. Jin was dissatisfied with the verdict and decided to hire a lawyer on his behalf, Jin Zhixiang, his father, to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court opened a hearing based on the petition, and the details have been reported in previous issues. The case has now concluded. On the afternoon of the previous day, the High Court, led by Judge Guo, together with Judges Sun and Fan, opened a hearing and ordered the appellant, Jin Peifang, to be brought before the court. The appeal was rejected, and Jin was returned to custody to await the final determination of the third-instance appeal period, after which he will be sent to prison to serve his sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Divorce Case of Shen Baigui Reopened for Debate <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Witness Invited by Shen Baigui</p>
<p>Is She an Aunt or a Biological Mother?</p>
<p>Shen Baigui, a 24-year-old woman from Songjiang, was married to Zhang Guifu from Chuansha through a matchmaker. They have one son and one daughter. Recently, because Zhang had an affair and neglected his wife, Shen hired lawyer Chen Xuelu to sue him in the Civil Court of the Second Special District for abandonment and adultery, requesting a divorce. Under repeated questioning, Zhang admitted to having an affair with a woman named Xiao Ayuan, but claimed that he had broken up with her in September of the previous year and had not abandoned his wife. Zhang's father, Zhang Yunqing, also appeared in court to testify that his son had separated from his mistress. The case had originally been declared closed. However, because the presiding judge believed that there were still key points in the case that needed to be investigated, he specially revoked the closure of the debate and reopened the debate. On the previous day, the judge, Wu Xiaoke, interrogated both parties and their witnesses in Civil Court No. 7. The defendant, Zhang Guifu, was represented by lawyer Xue Jiaqi, who argued that the defendant's admission during the previous hearing that he had broken up with his mistress in September of the previous year was a mistake. In fact, the defendant had an affair with Xiao Ayuan, also known as Hu Lao'er, or Wu Caiyun, in the spring of 1931. Later, with the plaintiff's consent, he took her as a concubine. In October of that year, due to a disagreement between the wife and concubine, the defendant's brother, Guiliang, intervened to mediate. Moreover, in mid-June of the following year, the plaintiff asked lawyer Gu to send a letter to the defendant questioning him. Lawyer Gu's letter can prove that the plaintiff had long known that the defendant had a concubine. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawsuit was beyond the time limit stipulated in Article 1053 of the Civil Code, and the request for divorce was not valid. The plaintiff, Shen Baigui, stated that the letter was not written by the woman who entrusted lawyer Gu. She only found out about her husband's affair in October of the previous year. She and her aunt repeatedly approached her husband to discuss the matter, but he always ignored them. Her aunt, Zhang Shen, is present in court to testify to this. Judge Guan summoned Zhang Shen to the court, and she testified that her son, Zhang Guifu, had an affair in October of the previous year. The woman and the daughter-in-law repeatedly blamed him, but he ignored them. This is the truth. The defendant's lawyer then stated that the witness, Zhang Shen, was actually the plaintiff's mother. Zhang Shen had a relationship with the defendant's father and</p>
<p>Allowed the plaintiff, Shen Baigui, to marry the defendant. Such a witness cannot testify in court and should be clearly investigated. Judge Wu examined the testimony and ordered the hearing to be adjourned for further examination.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Zhonghua Domestic Cotton Fabric Market, since its reorganization under the leadership of Zhang Rongchu, has been actively building a new market building at Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road. The building has now been completed, and the market is currently engaged in interior furnishings and decorations. It will soon move to the new market and formally open. It is reported that before the big closing period last year, the market had collected more than 30,000 bolts of fabric from various machine households, including the goods stored this year. The 2,000 basic machine households are also rushing to produce ordered goods, resulting in even more crowded shipments. In the future, merchants purchasing cotton fabric from the market will not only enjoy low prices, but also have access to a wide variety of styles. The market's main purpose is to help machine households and promote the sale of domestic yarn. In the future, all goods will be sold at cost price so that the market can circulate, machine households can benefit, and gradual measures can be taken to achieve the goal of controlling the Shanghai domestic cotton fabric industry.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Let's "Respectfully Return" It! <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Recently, we have received many letters, all wanting to read ancient poetry and classical books. One reader even borrowed a book about Tao Yuanming's life, but returned it to the library before finishing it. He said, "In the midst of a busy day, where can I find the time to read our books?" But in our opinion, this may not be the case. His inability to read is not due to being busy or lacking time, but perhaps because the books he is reading do not interest him and lack the power to attract him. That's why he quickly returned it. For example, the book he borrowed, "Tao Yuanming's Life," should indeed be "respectfully returned" and not read. Because reading these books not only fails to inspire ambition but also fails to point out a path of upward progress and struggle. Instead, it carries the danger of leading people to decadence, evading reality, and pursuing a world of fantasy. Therefore, we will use this incident as a starting point to discuss whether reading classical books benefits the general public.</p>
<p>There are many books with the above-mentioned problems. They can be roughly divided into two types: one type is where the things described in the book have already passed, and the words spoken can no longer be applied to the present. For example, in the book "Mencius," Mencius advocated for ancient reforms, describing the social systems of ancient sage kings and wise men, such as the eras of Wen, Wu, and Yi Yin, in a persuasive manner, setting out a set of rules for governing the country and bringing peace to the world, hoping that later generations would imitate them. However, we know that the relationship between the state and the people is no longer based on the principle of monarchs governing the people. What use are those methods of "governing the people"? Although we generally have to pay taxes now, we do not have to work for the emperor's family. Therefore, the proposal to reduce corvée labor for emperors and princes is fundamentally out of step with the times. Another type of book is one where, due to dissatisfaction with life and the lack of ways to improve it, people evade reality and specialize in pursuing an ideal paradise, but the result is decadence and passivity. Most of the classical books, from the Four Books and Five Classics to the collections of various scholars, can be said to belong to the former type. The latter includes the poems of many ancient poets, such as Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming, all the way to the recent martial arts novels.</p>
<p>We can suffer both of the above-mentioned disadvantages when reading Tao Yuanming's works and everything related to him. Therefore, we take him as an example to explain the reasons why we oppose the general public reading ancient poems, classical prose, ancient works, and decadent works.</p>
<p>Tao Yuanming is a unconstrained poet. Most people think that his poems are not decadent but are unrestrained and free from vulgarity. However, we believe that he evades reality, and evading reality is a sign of frustrated ambition and a shortcut to decadence.</p>
<p>A person is not born to evade reality. The reason for doing so is entirely because the cruel whip of the real world has shattered his beautiful dreams, making it impossible for him to obtain them in the real world. Therefore, he regards all practical life as "vulgar" and "sordid" and pursues it spiritually, fantasizing about a mysterious and wonderful paradise. Tao Yuanming was originally not a decadent person, not a person who put everything in the world out of his mind. This can be seen from his poem "Reproaching My Sons." He had five sons, but they "never liked paper and brush." He disliked Ashu for being lazy, and Ayi for "not loving literature." Ayong and Aduan, even at the age of thirteen, did not recognize "six" and "seven." Atong only knew how to eat pears and chestnuts all day long. He was not happy with any of these sons, but he had no way to change them. So he had to say, "If fate is such, then let's advance the cup." In other words, he said that he should just enjoy himself and not care about anything, because there was no way to manage it. But this only meant ignoring worldly affairs. He had an even more advanced proposition: "Unaware of my own existence, how can I know the value of things?" Forgetting oneself naturally eliminates the need to compete with the world.</p>
<p>But what kind of ideal life did Tao Yuanming pursue? What he pursued was a life where "willows and elms shade the back eaves, peach and plum trees are planted in front of the hall. Vaguely visible are the villages of distant people, and faintly visible are the smoke from the rural settlements. Dogs bark in the deep lanes, and chickens crow in the mulberry gardens. There is no dust or clutter in the courtyard, and the empty room has ample leisure." This idyllic paradise is the farmhouse life of "Changju" and "Jieni" (Changju and Jieni are two people's names, as mentioned in the Analects: "Changju and Jieni plowed together, and Confucius passed by them, and sent Zilu to ask for a ford"). It is a life of finding joy in the Way and not worrying about poverty. However, this kind of life can only be admired, and there is no possibility of achieving it in reality. So the old gentleman had to worry about poverty and had to suffer hardships. He had to say, "Gazing afar, it is difficult to reach, so I turn to thinking about diligent labor." He had to say, "How can farm families not suffer? I cannot refuse this hardship" and "I only wish it to be like this forever, and I do not lament personally tilling the land."</p>
<p>Therefore, if we hold the purpose of reading for practical use and with the intention of solving problems, then when reading Tao Yuanming's works and works about him, we must first answer the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Should we avoid the pain of life and look for a spiritual paradise elsewhere?</p>
<p>(2) Can we escape the pain of life?</p>
<p>(3) Can we still learn from Tao Yuanming and live his kind of simple, austere farm life?</p>
<p>To be honest, the above questions can only be answered in the negative: because the pain of life cannot be avoided, but must be eradicated at its roots through our efforts. Moreover, like the growth of history and people, when we are old, we look back on the joys of childhood, but we can no longer become children. So we "gaze" at the good life of the ancients, but in reality it is "difficult to reach." We "turn to thinking about diligent labor" and create our own new life. In short, times are evolving, and life in the future will only be better than before. Life under capitalist hegemony is certainly painful, but compared to the feudal era, it is heaven. So we don't need to yearn for the ancient life at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should read books that describe the pain of our real life and show us how to relieve this pain, and we should not read those books that are irrelevant to us, because we are people with limited time for reading and who are experiencing great pain in life.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people may doubt that reading the books of the ancients does not necessarily mean imitating the ancients, and even less does it mean being anesthetized by books. Then we can answer this way: our reading is not to become scholars, nor are we people with well-thought-out plans and a foundation of learning. They are waiting for the appropriate spiritual nourishment to cultivate themselves.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we oppose readers reading any relics of the past society that are far removed from our times. As for those who specialize in literature and the past social system and history, they are naturally to be considered separately.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Imperial Incense <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>▲ Introducing the Original Author</p>
<p>This book was originally in English, titled Imperial Incense, published in 1933 (last year) by the Dodd, Mead &amp; Company in New York. The original author is Princess Der Ling, who also wrote several books such as "Two Years in the Forbidden City" and "Golden Phoenix."</p>
<p>Der Ling was the daughter of Duke Yu Geng of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Yu Geng had served as an envoy to countries such as England and France in his early years. Therefore, his children followed him to travel in Western countries from a young age and received a high level of Western education. Almost everyone could master four or five languages. There were a total of five siblings, among whom the first and fourth (both male) died early and were unknown. The remaining three enjoyed great fame.</p>
<p>Der Ling was the third child and served in the Qing Palace for a long time. She was the most trusted female official of the Empress Dowager Cixi, and her treatment was better than others. Of course, most of the reason was because the Empress Dowager knew that she had been abroad, could write Western texts, and could speak Western languages!</p>
<p>Later, she married Mr. T. White, who was the American Vice Consul in Shanghai, and soon returned to the United States together. After returning, she worked as a journalist for a newspaper. Our female writer began her writing career at that time, and successively wrote many texts about the secret history of the Qing court and the personal life of the Empress Dowager Cixi. Among them, the most famous one, which already has a translated version, is "Two Years in the Forbidden City."</p>
<p>Although her works are all written in English because they were influenced by her own environment, she also had a good understanding of the literature of her motherland and could write good poems and lyrics. Unfortunately, I don't have any existing ones here that I can introduce.</p>
<p>She is 56 years old this year and is already a venerable old lady. Unfortunately, four or five years ago, she and Mr. T. White had a disagreement and eventually divorced. Divorce is certainly not a big deal in the New World, but we think it is very pitiful that she encountered such a change after the age of fifty. Especially a yellow race person, drifting alone in a foreign country, how desolate and painful is that? (1)</p>
<h3 id="e173">Spring in Zhabei <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Weng Hun</p>
<p>Ah! Spring is gradually, gradually, warming the earth: warming people's hearts! Ah! I, with infinite warmth, slowly strolled to the ruined Zhabei!</p>
<p>Ah! Zhabei is so ruined! Broken walls, broken eaves, tiles, gray mud, a mess everywhere! Although there are a few places that are being rebuilt, it is as rare as the morning stars. Ah! The tragedy of war! The fierceness of the enemy!</p>
<p>Ah! Now it is finally the world of the Spring God! Although Zhabei is so ruined, it also brings some business in the ruin. Among the broken walls, broken eaves, tiles, and gray mud, what is that emerald green? It is the tender shoots of spring grass!</p>
<p>Ah! The broken walls are silent: the broken eaves are silent: the tiles are silent: the gray mud is silent: in the desolate spring light, everything in Zhabei is silent! It is silently waiting for the exuberance of this spring grass!</p>
<p>Ah! Spring grass is exuberant! However, exuberant spring grass, but also do not forget that there were many flesh and blood nourishing you that year!</p>
<p>Ah! Spring in Zhabei!</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Past and Present of Contemporary People's Names <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>"The Book of Rites, Qu Li" says: "Men at twenty are capped and given a zi (courtesy name)." The "Book of Etiquette, Shi Guan Li" says: "To cap and give a zi is to respect their name." The "Yi, Qian Gua" says: "Unchanging in the world, without forming a name." Therefore, "Shuowen" says: "Name, comes from self-declaration. From mouth, from evening. Evening is dark. In darkness, one cannot see each other, so one uses the mouth to declare oneself." Today's people have names and zi, and the zi is the hao (style name), without difference. Trying to describe the famous people of the past twenty years, one can also feel the difference between the past and the present.</p>
<p>Liu Yazi, twenty years ago was actually named Qiji. His zi was Anru, also known as Yalu, a native of Wujiang. When he was in Shanghai with me at "Tianduo Bao," he was also signed Qing Si, so perhaps even fewer people know this. Hu Puan, from Wan Jing County, Anhui, was originally named Yunyu, zi Puan. Shao Yuanchong, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, was originally named Yongshu, zi Yiru. And his wife, Zhang Mojun, was originally named Zhaohan. Lü Bicheng, from Jingde, was originally named Duntian, and now even if one asks the women, almost no one remembers it. As for some other scholars: Zhang Taiyan, originally named Binglin, later inherited the learning of the Gu family of Kunshan, changed his name to Jiang, and then used the zi Yanwu of Tinglin, and began to change his hao to Taiyan. When he studied the "Mahayana Treatise on the Awakening of Faith," he also signed "So-and-so, a lay follower of the Buddha after 2383 years of the Buddha's death, in the land of Zhen Dan," or simply wrote "So-and-so, a white-clad follower of Zhen Dan." In the third and fourth years of the Republic, when he lost his freedom at Longquan Temple in Beiping, he named himself "Zhang, a man awaiting death." This old man can be said to be very fond of names. Wang Xishen from Liangxi, was originally named Yunzhang, zi Chunong, another hao was Xishen Cancike, and also signed "a member of the peasant family." Others like Xu Zhuodai, originally named Fulin, zi Zhuyan, more than twenty years ago, signed Banmei. Zheng Zhengqiu, originally named Bochang, another hao was Bainan, also known as Lilisuo Zhu." Even if one claims to be an old hand at the Shanghai scene, perhaps one or two would not know this.</p>

<p>Chapter 26: Generously Pledging One's Heart and Forgetting the Family to Serve the Country</p>
<p>Miserably Facing the Jade Mirror, Lamenting My Yearning for People</p>
<p>That kind of scratching-the-itch-from-afar consolation is not only useless to oneself, but rather feels annoying, so it's better not to let him know, which would be cleaner. Thinking so, that pent-up resentment wanted to come out, but she swallowed it back down again. But although this pent-up resentment was swallowed down, the tears in those eyes were impossible to endure any longer, hanging like beads on both cheeks in two strings, dragging to the corners of the mouth. Because the mirror was already dim and couldn't see her reflection, she couldn't see those two lines of tears, and she didn't feel it, so she didn't wipe them away, letting the tears drip from her face onto her clothes. She sat alone in the room, worrying like this in front of the mirror, and it was a windy and rainy night, with the door tightly closed, so she thought that no one would know. However, her hurried entry into the city today and hurried return home were too strange. Although she had said the reason, namely that Miss Huang was not at home, her expression was very unnatural and very suspicious. In addition, she had quietly gone into the room after dinner, which was also a bit strange. Ever since Zhao Ziqiang went on the expedition, Jiang had been paying attention to his actions at all times. How could she ignore his attitude today? So, when Guizhi was shedding tears in front of the mirror under the lamp, Jiang had been secretly watching outside the window for a long time. Originally, she didn't want to come in and comfort him on such a dark night, for fear of alarming Zhao's father. Later, when she saw Guizhi holding Zhao Ziqiang's photo hanging on the wall with both hands, silently facing it, and the tears kept dripping onto the photo, his chest heaving up and down as if he was silently sobbing, Jiang was startled, thinking that he wanted to find a short-sighted way out, so she couldn't help but shout from outside: Old girl, what's wrong with you? Aren't you going to sleep yet? (352)</p>

<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>An ordinary face, just needs to smear some soot on the backstage of the theater, and it becomes Zhang Fei, smear a face full of lime powder, and it is considered Cao Cao. When the play is over, put the face up to the basin, use soap on the face for a while, and then wipe it with a face towel, and it returns to its original appearance.</p>
<p>This kind of thing, in the parlance of the acting industry, is called hooking the face, which is actually what ordinary people call makeup.</p>
<p>Speaking of makeup, I remembered another thing. Once, the author was also playing the field, following a few friends to look for flowers and willows. Among a large group of singing warblers and swallows, I took a fancy to a peach-cheeked and apricot-eyed goddess, beautiful beyond description. So, at the height of my excitement, I extinguished the candle and left the hairpin. When I woke up the next morning and took a look, it was terrible. Several pieces of powder on the face had fallen off, and from the place where the powder had faded, I saw the original skin, not only yellow, but also covered with scorched black freckles, and the skin at the corners of the eyes and forehead showed traces of wrinkles. Hmm, such a face, without lying, my wife may be three or four points more beautiful than her. However, after some time, in a certain place, it was a true coincidence, and I met her again unexpectedly, and she was still like a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl, and I couldn't find any hateful signs on her face.</p>
<p>So I had to admire the greatness of makeup. Although it still has to show its original appearance in the end, before it is stripped of its makeup, it does have the power to turn defeat into victory, and the function of changing heads and faces.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Spring Pastoral <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Qie</p>
<p>Spring Sister uses her fragrant, sweet, and gentle cherry kisses to gently awaken all natural things on the earth from their winter slumber. Seedlings sprout; flowers bud; branches and trunks all stretch; leaves shed their scales and unfold. The spring sunshine is bright, and the spring air is rich and moist. The whole garden is filled with the colors of spring, intoxicating people's emotions. Since we don't have Shi Chong's Golden Valley, let's learn from Tao Yuanming and live a simple life tending to the fields! In the past, Yuling Zhongzi resigned from his high position to water his garden with a well sweep. When Fan Chi asked to learn about gardening, Confucius said, "I am not as good as an old gardener." The great novelist Tolstoy once pointed to the garden outside the window and said to a friend, "This is my cage of joy; inside it possesses all kinds of medicines that can cure all kinds of diseases in people, without needing to rely on doctors and pharmacies." From this perspective, growing flowers and trees is indeed a refined and profound pursuit. Isn't it a good thing for us to engage in pastoral life? In this bright spring season, let's talk about the pastoral life!</p>
<p>(1)  Rapeseed, named because it originated in the Hotan region. One says Lei County is in Shaanxi. Botanically, it belongs to the cruciferous family, along with mustard, shepherd's purse, Chinese cabbage, radish, and turnip. It has four yellow petals arranged in a cross shape. Inside the flower are six stamens, four long and two short, and one pistil, with the stigma divided into two branches to absorb pollen. Inside the flower is also a nectary, providing food for bees and butterflies. The petals have a volatile fragrance that is constantly released into the air to attract insects, because it is an "insect-pollinated flower." The leaves are large and dark green, without petioles, and the leaf base tightly wraps around the stem. After flowering, it forms a purple-brown pod. When ripe, it splits open to release seeds, which are the raw material for rapeseed oil. It can be eaten or used as fuel. In summary, the stems and leaves of rapeseed are rich in nitrogen, calcium, iron, and other essential substances, making it a beneficial vegetable for the human body. The oil is not only a substitute for fuel but also an essential source of fat for the human body. A garden of yellow flowers, a few patches of rapeseed, refreshing to the eyes, palatable and filling to the stomach, truly a treasure.</p>
<p>(2) Peas are papilionaceous plants, also known as legumes, and belong to the same family as redbuds, alfalfa, broad beans, etc. Its flowers are very beautiful, with one banner petal, two wing petals, and two keel petals, forming a butterfly-shaped flower. Inside the flower are ten stamens, nine fused and one free, and one pistil with a hairy stigma, so it is also an "insect-pollinated flower." The leaves are pinnately compound, and the stem end has tendrils, so it can spread on other objects. The fruit is called a "pod," and the seeds can be cooked and eaten, with a delicious taste. The pods and stems and leaves can be used to feed cattle and horses. Other types of beans can also be pressed for oil and made into flour. This is a recent invention and a major export commodity. It is a pity that the three northeastern provinces, which are richest in soybean production, have changed color. I wonder how many rights and interests have been lost! The garden is full of butterflies, vividly alive. Planting a few acres of peas provides both food and enjoyment.</p>
<p>(3) Alfalfa, also known as purple clover, is called "grass beans" in Shanghai and belongs to the same papilionaceous family as peas. It is divided into three main types: one called "purple alfalfa," with stems over a foot tall and purple flowers, very similar to peas. Another is called "yellow alfalfa," with stems spreading on the ground, yellow three-petaled flowers, and sickle-shaped pods. The "Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies of Dayuan" contains the phrase "horses love alfalfa." Later, Han envoys brought its seeds to China, and China has had alfalfa ever since. There is also a type called "wild alfalfa," also known as "southern alfalfa," which is what people in Shanghai call "grass beans." It has many local names. People in Ningbo call it "grass seeds," or "golden flower vegetable," "panqi head," and "purple clover" are also its other names. The stems lie on the ground, and the leaves are composed of three leaflets, with the leaflets being obovate and notched at the top. The flowers are small and yellow, shaped like a small butterfly. The pods are spiral-shaped and covered with many fine thorns. It can be planted throughout southern China, hence the name "southern alfalfa." The roots of both alfalfa and peas have many "root nodules," which are rich in nitrogen and are an excellent fertilizer. Therefore, burying their old roots and stems in the soil is enough to nourish other crops.</p>
<p>(4) Turnip, also known as kohlrabi, is a vegetable plant and also belongs to the cruciferous family. The root is round and fleshy, and the leaves are very large. It is extremely rich in nutrients and has a very sweet taste; it is especially delicious when roasted with pork. It blooms with yellow flowers in the spring, very similar to rapeseed. It is worth planting in the garden! Shao Changheng admired his ancestors who grew melons at Qingmen (Shao Ping) and called himself "Old Gardener of Qingmen." As the world changes rapidly, I regret not being able to leave and become the Old Gardener of Qingmen!</p>

<h3 id="e179">Far Eastern Basketball Preliminary Selection After the Destruction of the Chinese Basketball Hall <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Proposed to Build an Open-Air Court on the Baseball Field</p>
<p>Rebuilding on the Original Site is Impossible</p>
<p>Fire Loss Estimated at Around 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Chinese Basketball Hall, with a history of ten years, was completely destroyed by last night's fire and is no longer usable. Fortunately, the Sports Advancement Association had fire insurance, so there will be no losses. However, with the Far Eastern basketball preliminary selection imminent, a new venue must be found. According to reporter inquiries, the situation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e180">Circumstances of the Fire <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>According to Zhang Huiqing, an association employee who lived in the basketball hall, around 11 o'clock that night, he had not yet fallen asleep when he suddenly heard crackling sounds. Greatly alarmed, he got up to check and saw that the corner window facing the road was on fire. He immediately woke up the servants to fetch water and put out the fire, while Zhang ran to the office to call the fire department. The basketball hall was entirely made of wood and painted with oil paint. By the time Zhang returned, it was beyond saving. Within three-quarters of an hour, it was completely destroyed. What a pity!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Loss Statistics <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the complete destruction of the basketball hall, the most regrettable thing was the complete destruction of all the sports equipment stored in the equipment room. The loss is estimated to be over 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, including hurdles and hurdle frames. The Advancement Association issued an order yesterday to purchase replacements because the Far Eastern preliminary selection is imminent. Therefore, including the equipment, the loss is estimated to be around 10,000 yuan. The fire insurance of the Advancement Association is with Shenchang Foreign Firm, totaling 14,000 yuan, it is said. According to Zhang, the fire likely started in the equipment room, but the cause of the fire is unknown.</p>

<p>According to Zhou Jiaqi, the venue for the Far Eastern basketball preliminary selection is not a problem. It can be held elsewhere. There is also a plan to build an open-air court in the baseball field, which would be more convenient. However, the plan to rebuild on the original site will definitely not be realized.</p>

<p>Beijing News: In the single round-robin championship battle between the three winning teams of the National Sports, Military Academy, and Public Recreation in the Sixth Beijing Basketball Tournament, the Military Academy defeated Public Recreation, and the National Sports defeated the Military Academy. On the afternoon of the 31st, at 4:00 PM, the National Sports defeated Public Recreation by a large margin of 47 to 29, winning the championship. In the first half, the score was 21 to 9. The National Sports team had a well-organized formation and pure teamwork, like a machine. The players were also very strong and played with great energy. Public Recreation was inferior in comparison and had little ability to resist. The Beijing team participating in the Far Eastern Games preliminary selection will be based on the National Sports team, supplemented by the elite players from the Military Academy and Public Recreation, and it is expected to give the North China and Shanghai teams fierce resistance.</p>

<p>— 3-0 —</p>
<p>▲ No Score for Either Side in the First Half</p>
<p>▲ Youyou Scores Three Goals in a Row in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the only Group A match of the Western League Football, Youyou and Jinan met at the baseball field. All the spectators had come with tickets refunded from the previous day, so there were over 3,000 people in attendance. Both sides played cleanly and crisply, a rare good phenomenon in Chinese team matches. In the morning, the two sides exchanged attacks and defenses, making it difficult to distinguish between them. In the second half, Youyou worked hard and scored three goals in a row. Jinan's forwards only had Luo Haiguang as their scoring talent, so they could only listen to Youyou's attacks and were unable to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>The situation was dull, and there was no score for either side. Youyou kicked off, and Zhu Shengfa and Xi Qiaosheng, in a blink of an eye, broke into Jinan's penalty area. Sun Tielui shot at the goal, and Xiao Mei jumped up to block the ball and avert the danger. The Jinan team made a second attempt to break in, but Liu Shizan jumped up and headed the ball out. Zhong Yongsen broke through to the baseline and passed to the center, Sun Tielui put all his strength into a low shot, which Xiao Mei safely caught, eliciting cheers from the audience. Jinan's three forwards also occasionally threatened the enemy, but due to unfamiliar coordination, they achieved little effect. Zhong Yongsen took a shot from 15 yards, but it was blocked by the crossbar. When Liu Shizan and Zhong Yongsen fell down at the same time while tackling the ball, the first half also ended.</p>
<p>The spring clouds suddenly cleared, and Jiaqiu scored. At the beginning of the second half, Youyou immediately adopted strong tactics, repeatedly launching blatant invasions against Jinan. Zhu Shengfa passed horizontally, and Zhong Yongsen shot quickly. Mei Meimei's nine-inch golden lotus saved the day. Suddenly, Meimei abandoned the empty goal and made a return trip. Xi A Qiao quickly shot at the empty goal, shocking the audience. Fortunately, the goal was short, and the ball went high, avoiding a major disaster. But soon, Sun Tielui hovered outside the goal, lingering for a long time, with the Jinan guards watching intently. Unexpectedly, Chen Jiaqiu suddenly burst out and kicked the ball, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>Adding the icing on the cake, Qiaosheng scored. Jinan's Gu Shangqin, as the central commander, lost a city, and his anger can be imagined. So he and Haiguang rallied their troops to serve the country. But after six expeditions to Qishan, it was still difficult to achieve their wishes. Zhong Yongsen penetrated the defense, and Qiaosheng swept the goal with a kick, missing by only a foot. However, troubles arose in front of the Jinan goal, creating a chaotic scene. Liu Shizan ran back and forth, saving many dangerous balls. Meimei also provided warmth and care, being very attentive. Xi Qiaosheng took advantage of the unpreparedness of the opposing team and suddenly seized an opportunity to kick the ball at the goal. The ball was high and fast, and Jinan lost another city.</p>
<p>The Three Arrows of Tianshan, Yongsen Draws His Bow. The captain of the long legs, Xiao Luo, his anger overflowing with written words, commanded the three armies to launch a northern expedition. In the midst of ten thousand horses, he drew his bow and aimed at the red heart, but Tang Yongchun safely caught the ball, otherwise it could have broken through Tang Xian's defense. After a while, the ball went out to the northwest corner, hovering between the southeast. Zhu Shengfa hooked it to the front of the goal, Mei Hongbao turned around to grab it, Zhong Yongsen rushed there like a fly, and sent it into the goal, making the score 3 to 0. After that, Jinan repeatedly tried to make a desperate gamble, but due to bad luck, it was difficult to enter the inner sanctum. Therefore, they were defeated.</p>

Therefore, Donghua won without labor. The battle between the Western police and Lacus at the Shenyuan Stadium was also postponed.</p>

<p>The inaugural closing ceremony of the Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football League was held at the Municipal Sports Field yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The teams competing were Dawn and Humin from Group Dao. In the first half, Dawn attacked south with the wind at their backs, gaining a lot of advantage. Within five minutes of the start of the match, they scored a goal. Soon after, Dawn took advantage of a free kick opportunity, passing the ball around and kicking in another goal. In the second half, Humin switched from defense to offense, and their momentum was extremely fierce. Unfortunately, they missed by inches every time, and Dawn took advantage of this to break in and score another goal. Therefore, they won the championship of the group with a score of 3 to 0. In terms of strength, Humin was not weaker than Dawn, but due to the goalkeeper's panic in the game, they suffered an unexpected setback. What a pity.</p>

After the summer, efforts will be made to revive the rural areas, promote rural primary schools, and increase the number of secondary schools in accordance with the standards promulgated by the Ministry, and expand vocational schools. The Shaanxi Arsenal, after being taken over by the provincial government, will be used to run vocational schools in the future. Regarding educational funding, it is said that funding has been secured for the promotion of educational undertakings and is not a problem. It is also heard that it is planned to order vocational schools in each county to focus on running more agricultural schools, and the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College will conduct experiments in the future.

<h3 id="e194">Yenching University Appeals for a Million-Dollar Foundation <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Since Yenching University moved from Kuijia Factory in Chongwenmen in the city to its current site in Haidian in the 15th year of the Republic of China, its construction has been completed, and its management is strict. Among the public and private universities in Beiping, it has won the reputation of being the best. In addition to the three colleges of Arts, Sciences, and Law, which are divided into more than 20 departments, there are also facilities such as the Qinghe Town Model Rural Experimental Zone, the Woolen Fabric Improvement and Manufacturing Institute, and primary and secondary schools and kindergartens. The annual expenditure, excluding students' personal expenses, is about one million yuan. The school's foundation mostly comes from the United States. The number of donations from Chinese friends is minimal. Since the global economic depression in the past two years has affected the economic situation in the United States, the price of gold has plummeted, and the exchange rate has decreased. As a result, the school's financial situation has also been slightly strained. However, the school authorities, in addition to reducing school administration and the salaries of faculty and staff, still strive to improve the treatment and facilities for students, so that they can study with peace of mind. According to statistics, the school still needs to subsidize more than 800 yuan per year for each student, in addition to the tuition and accommodation fees. The school currently has more than 800 students, and the annual cost of the students themselves is between 600,000 and 700,000 yuan. Since the beginning of this school year, the school has sought to establish the economic foundation of the school and to encourage Chinese people to help themselves. The Board of Directors has passed a resolution to launch a campaign in China to raise a million-dollar foundation. The school's faculty, students, and alumni have also gladly agreed to take responsibility. The faculty has decided to automatically donate salaries to complete the amount of 100,000 yuan. The students, in addition to donating at least 25 yuan per half-year, must also raise 100 yuan from outside. The alumni are actively working in major ports such as Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing. The Beiping alumni have formed 40 ten-person groups, led by Quan Shaowen, a graduate of the school and consultant of Jin City Bank, to carry out all the work. In Tianjin, Zhou Yabo and others are responsible for promoting the fundraising and soliciting donations from outside. Nanjing is also in progress. In Shanghai, Chen Liting and Fang Fuan are responsible for fundraising. In addition, the Chairman of the School Board, Kong Xiangxi, the Vice-Chairman, Yan Huiqing, the President, Zhou Yichun, and the Provost, Situ Leideng, in view of the future development and expansion of the school, which depends on the guidance and assistance of people from all walks of life, have recently jointly invited important figures from the political, academic, and business circles, including Lin Sen, Wang Zhaoming, Song Ziwen, Hu Yuanzhi, Jiang Menglin, Zhang Boling, Wang Xiaolong, and prominent figures from the press, including Shi Liangcai, Wang Boqi, and Dong XianGuang, to be the school's patrons. According to the praise expressed by all parties and the efforts of the school's teachers, students, and alumni, the fundraising of this million-dollar foundation can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Boxer Indemnity of Various Countries and Educational and Cultural Undertakings (1) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Boxer Indemnity was the indemnity taken from our country by 14 countries, including Germany, France, England, Italy, Russia, Austria, the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Spain, and Belgium, in the Xinchou Treaty (i.e., the 27th year of Guangxu) at the end of the Qing Dynasty. According to the treaty, the total amount of the indemnity was approximately 450 million taels of Haikwan silver (i.e., 450 million taels). This indemnity accrued interest at an annual rate of 4%, and the repayment period was limited to 39 years. The total amount of principal and interest was 988,123,815 taels of Haikwan silver. The repayment period began on January 1, 1902, and ended in 1940. It was stipulated that the principal should be repaid once a year and the interest paid twice a year. The sources of indemnity guarantee were roughly divided into three types: (1) various customs revenues, (2) various Changguan revenues, and (3) various salt revenues, so that our country's customs and salt revenues were all in the hands of others.</p>
<p>In the 34th year of the Qing Guangxu period (i.e., 1909), Russia proposed to reduce a portion of the Boxer Indemnity, that is, to return it to China, which would be used to establish Tsinghua School and send students to study in the United States. By the sixth year of the Republic of China, our country declared war on Germany, and thanks to the consent of the Allied countries, there was a proposal to defer the Boxer Indemnity. The Boxer Indemnities of Germany and Austria naturally disappeared due to the declaration of war.</p>
<p>After the 13th year of the Republic of China, Soviet Russia voluntarily abandoned the indemnity, and the United States, France, Belgium, England, Italy, and the Netherlands also successively expressed their willingness to return the indemnity due to China. Unfortunately, due to the unrest in China's situation or other reasons, it was delayed until recent years. Only the United States, France, Belgium, England, and the Netherlands have successively returned the indemnity and formally established an agreement. Its use is determined to be for promoting Chinese education and cultural undertakings, or temporarily transferred to railway transportation, water conservancy, industry, or bank rehabilitation, which is more in line with the political program personally drafted by the Premier in the past to allocate the indemnity entirely for educational funding. As for the Boxer Indemnities of Russia, Japan, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Norway, whether they are said to be returned or not, it is suspected that there is too little benefit to China's educational and cultural undertakings. As for the management plans and distribution of this returned indemnity, they are respectively undertaken by the Board of Directors or the Committee. The following is a brief comparison table of the Boxer Indemnities of the existing management agencies, based on the number and distribution of the Boxer Indemnities returned by various countries compiled by the Ministry of Finance:</p>
<p>Country Current Annual Repayment of Principal and Interest Agreed Distribution</p>
<p>US US$1,919,967.10 US (1) Tsinghua University and expenses for students studying in the United States, (2) cultural education, first to rescue the Sino-French Industrial Bank, and to handle Sino-French education, youth and charitable undertakings</p>
<p>France US$4,028,795.74</p>
<p>Belgium US$621,432.96 After repaying the Hua-Bi Bank's advances, 40% to the Longhai Railway, 35% to the China National Railway, for the purchase of materials from Belgium, and 25% for educational and charitable undertakings.</p>
<p>England £596,481.287 (1) From December of the 11th year of the Republic of China, the British Boxer Indemnity has been deposited in London banks. According to the agreement, in addition to the expenses borne by Article 1, Sections 1 and 3 of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Regulations in 1925 and the allocation of £265,000 and £200,000 respectively to grant the University of Hong Kong to educate Chinese students and to the Chinese Committee of various universities in London to promote cultural relations between China and England, all will be handed over to the London Purchasing Committee to purchase materials for the construction and development of Chinese National Railways and other materials from England; (2) According to the agreed exchange of notes, half of the British Boxer Indemnity that expires each time will be handed over to the London Purchasing Committee and half to the Chinese Board of Directors to handle Sino-British education and other mutually beneficial specialties, and 65% of the returned indemnity will be used for China's water conservancy undertakings, and 35% will be used for cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>Netherlands 306,605 Florins 289</p>
<p>The status of the Boxer Indemnities returned by various countries is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The United States' Boxer Indemnity</p>
<p>1.  Motivation for Return</p>
<p>The United States took the lead in returning the Boxer Indemnity. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Liang Cheng, the Chinese Minister to the United States, pointed out that the amount of indemnity paid by China to the United States was excessively high compared to the military expenses and the compensation for the merchants, missionaries, and soldiers of the United States. He specially consulted with the US government to reduce it. In 1909, the US government finally agreed to his request to reduce the amount of the Boxer Indemnity, which would be used to establish Tsinghua School and send students to study in the United States. This so-called reduction is actually the return. The estimated amount is 11 million yuan. This is the beginning of the United States' second implementation of the return of funds to promote Chinese educational undertakings.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association Held its Annual Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>

<p>▲ Lu Shibai, Pan Gongzhan, and Others Elected as Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the National Film Industry to Promote the New Life Movement</p>
<p>▲ Request to the Central Government to Expedite the Establishment of a Film Control Commission</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association held its first annual meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Public Education Center at 2:00 PM yesterday to elect executive and supervisory committee members. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Attendees Members present included Chu Minyi, representative of the Head Office; Jiang Huaisu and Mao Yun, representatives of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Jiang Jianbai, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau; and members Pan Gongzhan (representing Chen Bai), Zheng Zhengqiu, Chen Bai, Yang Minshi, Lu Shibai, Tao Baichuan, Li Zhaohuan, Shao Zuiweng, Li Pingqian, Hu Die, Chen Yumei, Hong Shen, Shen Xiling, Yao Suifeng, Chen Songchun, Chen Dabei, Xu Gongmei, Xu Xinfu, Gao Tianqi, Gao Qianping, Zhang Shichuan, Zhang Liangchun, Cheng Bugao, Cheng Kuanzheng, Tang Jie, Long Jianong, Xiao Ying, Yang Jingyi, Chen Kangran, and over eighty others.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Proceedings The meeting was chaired by Zheng Zhengqiu. After formal greetings, the chairman gave a report, followed by instructions from Chu Minyi, representing the Head Office, and speeches by Mao Yun, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Jiang Jianbai, representing the Municipal Education Bureau. Jiang Huaisu then delivered a speech, and Chen Bai reported on the association's affairs. Proposals were discussed, the association's charter was amended, and the second executive and supervisory committee members were elected. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Chu's Instructions Chu Minyi, representing the Head Office, stated briefly that since attending the establishment of the Shanghai Branch last year, it had been half a year. During this half-year, Shanghai had made extraordinary efforts in popularizing educational films. On behalf of the Head Office, he expressed his gratitude. We know that the power of film is quite great. Any movement, if using film as a tool, is easily effective. Now, Chairman Chiang is promoting the New Life Movement, which is a movement to revive the nation. All localities are implementing it. If we can use film to portray the meaning of the New Life Movement on the silver screen, its propaganda effect will be far greater than any other method. Educational films focus on social education, and the New Life Movement is a movement to improve society. He hoped that after the re-election of the Shanghai Branch, everyone would work together to produce films on the New Life Movement to help realize the New Life Movement, he said.</p>
<p>▲ Proposals Passed (1) Request the Head Office to forward to the Central Government a proposal to expedite the establishment of a National Film Control Commission to facilitate the promotion of the New Life Movement. (2) The association will send letters to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Education Bureau, and the Head Office to forward separately to the Central Propaganda Committee, as well as the Ministries of Education, Interior, and Railways, requesting subsidies, and also send letters to the association's honorary members requesting donations to expedite the production of films. (3) The domestic film "Sister Flowers" has been continuously shown in the city for over forty days, breaking the latest record in the Chinese film industry, and its plot and performances have deep value in art and consciousness. The merits of the screenwriter, director, and leading actors should not be buried. It is proposed that the association separately award citations and request the Head Office to forward them to the Central Propaganda Committee for commendation. (4) It is proposed to telegraph all film companies nationwide to unanimously support and promote the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang. All of the above proposals were passed and handed over to the executive committee for handling.</p>
<p>▲ Election Results The elected executive committee members were Lu Shibai, Chen Heqin, Chen Bai, Yang Minshi, Tong Xingbai, Li Zhaohuan, Zhou Jianyun, and seven others. The alternate executive committee members were Yao Geng, Chen Songchun, Shao Zuiweng, and Xu Gongmei, four people. The supervisory committee members were Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Cao Huiqun, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Li Minwei, five people. The alternate supervisory committee members were Bu Wancang, Qiu Qixiang, and Tao Baixun, three people.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the National Film Companies Greetings to all film companies nationwide. Since national strength has been insufficient and incidents have been numerous, the people's livelihood has frequently declined, and morality has increasingly fallen into ruin. Foreign troubles are pressing, internal disasters have not ended, and the country is in danger of collapse, like a pile of eggs. The trend of the times is pressing, and the difficult situation is becoming more urgent. This is precisely the time to strive for self-improvement and to plan for survival through transformation. The rise and fall of a country depend on the strength or weakness of its people, and the strength or weakness of the people depends on their way of life. The expression of vitality can be measured by their morality of "acting with constant principles" and their knowledge "used to gather affairs." Now, when we discuss morality in our country, the new has not been established, and the old has been abandoned. When we discuss knowledge, we have no time to impart it, let alone seek creation. Moreover, the mixture is impure, and refinement and crudeness are advancing together, which is a common phenomenon of the transition period. If society becomes accustomed to extravagance and thought becomes decadent, either abandoning themselves or indulging in dissipation, when can the disaster of national destruction be avoided? When can the ridicule of being a "sick man" be cleared? Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, with foresight, resolutely advocated the New Life Movement, so as to awaken those who are lost in illusion and revive the nation. It is truly an urgent task. Therefore, those with knowledge within the country resonated together, and the Party's deliberations were like echoing sounds. The people of this association admired and looked up to him, and secretly rejoiced. If our Chinese nation can innovate and save itself, resolve to cultivate itself, and display its talents and work together upwards, then China will naturally have no worries about sinking into the sea. Furthermore, the importance of the film industry in the New Life Movement should also be emphasized. The mission of film is not only limited to art, but it also bears the responsibility of general social education. Its introduction of knowledge, communication of ideas, promotion of morality, and correction of habits are all closely related to the daily life of the people, and its impact is both deep and significant, which everyone knows. It is unnecessary to cite facts as evidence. For example, in the American Recovery Movement, all films produced by American film companies added the Blue Eagle Movement logo to arouse the people's attention. The intention was very good, and the effect was also great. According to regulations, all kinds of manufactured products must have the New Life Movement logo printed on them from March 1, 1934, which Chairman Chiang has clearly stipulated. Film is also one of the manufactured products, so the film industry should promptly add this logo and add full-text subtitles such as "New Life Knowledge" to arouse the audience's attention and support for this movement at all times. At the same time, in terms of content, any crude, dirty, or unclean actions, as well as extravagant decorations, that are contrary to the principles of the New Life Movement and give the public a bad impression, should be avoided as much as possible unless absolutely necessary. The virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame should be expressed in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, so that the effect of subtle influence will naturally be greater than any propaganda. The mentality of saving the country and protecting the family should be the same, and all lifelines are tied to breathing. We should breathe out the old and take in the new to seek life. I am ashamed of my humble words, but I am willing to pour out my heart with sincerity. I only hope that you will examine them. The entire membership of the first general meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association bows.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Three Points on the Contribution of the First Draft of the Constitution to National Education (Part Two) Xie En Gao <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>III. Academic Research Must Stipulate Freedom for the People Academic research has no end, and the state should not restrict it to hinder its progress. Especially in today's China, where academic thought is scarce and research voices are low. Before 1694, various studies in Prussia were completely controlled by religion, so academic thought could not make significant progress. In 1694, a new-style university was founded [Halle University], advocating the principle of "freedom of research," eliminating the shackles of prejudice and external interference. As a result, academic thought suddenly became vigorous. The University of Berlin was established in 1809, and the wind of freedom of research became more intense. Whether it was any faculty of theology, law, medicine, or science, the spirit of criticism was implemented to explore the truth. Before long, theories arose and masters emerged, making Germany the source of academic thought in the world, with eternal glory in history. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in our country, the monarchs of various countries competed for hegemony, and adopted a laissez-faire policy for speech and thought, so various schools arose and created theories, making unprecedented contributions to scholarship. Historians call it the golden age of Chinese scholarship. After Qin Shihuang unified political power, he settled on one, thought lost its freedom, and scholarship suddenly declined. It can be seen that whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, scholarship flourishes when freedom is granted, and it does not prosper when restrictions are imposed. In recent times, many countries in the world have confirmed the principle of "academic freedom" in their constitutions, such as Poland stipulates that research and publication of results are free, Greece stipulates that art and science are freely taught, and the state is responsible for protecting and developing them, Germany stipulates that art and science and their teaching are free, and the state must protect and reward them, and Estonia stipulates that science, art, and their teaching are free. This draft constitution only stipulates in the chapter on "Rights and Obligations of the People" that "The people have freedom of speech, writing and publication..." and does not confirm in the chapter on "National Education" that "Research and scholarship belong to freedom." In fact, speech, writing and publication are all methods of publishing the results of research. If research cannot be free, even if speech, writing and publication are free, the substance has been severely restricted, which is equal to not being free. If it is to prevent harm to the nation, the state, and society, it is possible to add a proviso "but not to violate the law," and there should definitely not be a prejudice against academic freedom. None of the above three points are included in this draft constitution, but judging from the domestic needs, it seems that they cannot be ignored. I don't know if the gentlemen who are the main drafters and my colleagues in education think so too.</p>

<h3 id="e207">An Elucidation of伤寒 (Typhoid Fever) - 1 <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>What has been described above are the distinctions ancient people made regarding 伤寒 (typhoid fever), 温热 (warm febrile diseases), and 时行 (epidemic diseases). Generally, these distinctions are based on the Yin-Yang theory and Wang Shuhe's 伤寒例 (Examples of Typhoid Fever). Wu Youke had already made considerable corrections to the inaccuracies, as seen in Wu's 温疫论 (Treatise on Warm Epidemics). Now, I excerpt the essentials below to advocate that there were those who spoke out against the ancients early on. The words of the ancients are not necessarily trustworthy, and this is not a recent realization. Wu Youke said, "The twelve meridians, along with the eight extraordinary meridians, are nothing but the pathways for nourishing qi and blood, circulating throughout the body, and nourishing all its parts. Therefore, the innate primordial qi is present everywhere. When it is not present, numbness and insensitivity occur. The mechanism of creation never ceases to operate. If it does not operate, there will be collapse and death. However, the evils of wind, cold, heat, and dampness cannot coexist with the body's defense mechanisms. Once affected, illness and suffering arise. If not eliminated, there is imminent danger or death. Injury from wind and cold, in mild cases, results in common cold; in severe cases, it results in 伤寒 (typhoid fever). Even in the mildest case of the common cold, there are still symptoms such as headache, body ache, stiffness in the limbs, nasal congestion, hoarse voice, phlegm, cough, and shortness of breath." Chills and fever should immediately indicate illness and cannot be concealed. Now, the severe cold in winter is no small matter. How can it be concealed and only manifest later?" This is Wu's rebuttal of the Yin-Yang theory's statement that "Those who do not become ill immediately have the cold poison stored in their muscles and skin, which transforms into 温病 (warm disease) in spring and into 暑病 (summer disease) in summer." It also refutes the 素問 (Suwen)'s 生氣通天論 (Treatise on the Generation of Qi in Heaven) which states, "Injury from cold in winter inevitably results in 温病 (warm disease) in spring." He directly attacked what had been revered as the medical bible for thousands of years. Wu is truly one of a kind in history. Wu also said, "Furthermore, we must ask what kind of affliction results in immediate illness, and what kind does not. Those who are afflicted and become ill immediately experience headaches as if their heads are splitting, body aches as if they have been beaten, aversion to cold, stiff neck, fever as if burning, sometimes shortness of breath, sometimes vomiting, and in severe cases, convulsions. The six pulses are rapid and frequent, and there is restlessness and unease. Subsequent changes are beyond description. Sudden mismanagement can lead to death. Those who are afflicted but do not become ill immediately feel no sensation at all. Later, it extends to spring and summer. After being afflicted, before it manifests, their diet, daily life, and behavior are normal, and their complexion, voice, and breath are in no way different. The symptoms that eventually manifest are no less severe than those of 伤寒 (typhoid fever). Moreover, injury from wind and cold invariably enters through the skin and surface, and the injury is the same to the defensive qi. The affliction is all due to wind and cold. Why is one oblivious, not aware of being afflicted, and ignorant of being stored, while the other is so sensitive, immediately manifesting, and manifesting violently? Originating from the same source but flowing in different streams, there is a world of difference. Is there no explanation? If there is no explanation, then we know that the origin of 温热 (warm febrile diseases) is not from affliction by wind and cold." Wu believed that the ancients did not provide a clear explanation for the principle of those who are afflicted and become ill immediately versus those who are afflicted and do not become ill immediately. Later generations blindly followed without question and did not think to pursue the origin of this theory, leading to the accumulation of errors and the acceptance of falsehood as truth. Therefore, he questioned it layer by layer. Alas, if our country's medical techniques employed Wu's method of pursuing the basis step by step, one would find absurdity everywhere. Those who can achieve a clear explanation and thus establish themselves in the world are probably one in a thousand. They all echo others and do not understand the reason why. If Wu were alive today, I would not believe that he would not be at the forefront of the medical revolution. Today's old doctors, who adhere to theories without explanation and forcefully act as interpreters, are all sinners against Wu.</p>
<p>Wu also said, "They constantly say that the cold poison is stored between the skin and muscles. The muscles are the body's surface, and the skin is the superficial layer of the skin. In between, every tiny aperture is a place where defensive qi traverses. Even a minor wind and cold causing a common cold cannot be retained and should immediately result in illness. How can it be that severe cold, a killing and fierce qi, affecting the shallowest part of the skin, can be concealed? From this, we can infer that this is impossible." This is Wu's attack on the statement that the cold poison is stored in the muscles and skin.</p>
<h3 id="e208">A Path to National Health: "Health Education" <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Weng Zhilong</p>
<p>The health of each individual that constitutes a nation is interlinked with the strength or weakness of that nation. Therefore, in modern European and American countries, health education for the nation is promoted with the greatest effort. It is indeed because, to create future fighters, it is not only in the research and invention of scientific weaponry, but especially in cultivating the general public with resistant physical strength and tenacious spirit. Looking back at our Chinese nation, we are still completely oblivious. The statistics on mortality rates in recent years are truly alarming. The lagging of national health is an obvious fact. Last year, I was ordered to go to Europe to investigate medicine and public health. I felt that the country was competing fiercely for national health, and all were working together for public health as a unified goal. Therefore, health education must be given special attention in our country's current situation. From my humble perspective, it should be carried out in the following three aspects to have any hope of success.</p>
<p>(1) Family Health Education</p>
<p>As the saying goes, early habits become innate, and habits become natural. Therefore, the cultivation of children's habits is extremely important. And the cultivation of habits relies entirely on the family. Parents should first create an environment suitable for hygiene to allow children to live in it. Regarding everything about clothing, food, housing, and all aspects of daily life, both passive defense and active physical education should be constantly explained to them so that they become habits. In addition, attention should also be paid to the imparting of knowledge such as dietary hygiene and sex education. Things like displaying health pictures and explaining the reasons for each health measure should be explained in detail to them without fear of tediousness to consolidate their belief in hygiene. These are all very important. Most of our ordinary families fail to consider this, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>(2) School Health Education</p>
<p>Schools are models of society, and students are members who will participate in various activities in society in the future. Therefore, the cultivation of morality, the cultivation of habits, and the transmission of knowledge and skills are the missions that schools should undertake. If teachers know the importance of health to national health, they should pay special attention to this point and create a scientifically hygienic environment for everything in the school, so that students are influenced by what they see and hear and develop hygienic habits imperceptibly. In addition, detailed explanations should also be given during health class and physical education class to make them understand. It is best to have more posters, models, and slides for them to observe in order to establish their health concepts firmly. When I was in the Ministry of Education discussing the currently established curriculum standards for schools at all levels, I proposed adding health classes to primary and secondary schools, and now it has been confirmed, which is really a fortunate thing. Because students have health knowledge, on the one hand, they can pay attention to personal hygiene and disease prevention; on the other hand, when they return to their families or serve the society in the future, they can also help the family, society, and the country to promote health matters and spread the importance of hygiene, and their power is very great. Most schools at all levels in our country, except for a few that pay attention, lack complete equipment and cannot discuss this, which is very regrettable. In the future, we should find ways to increase health equipment fees to actively carry out this education.</p>
<p>(3) Social Health Education</p>
<p>Society is the place where the various members of the nation reside. If the environment is poor and unhealthy, health will be affected. This is something that the municipal government should pay special attention to. I think that in addition to the cleanliness of streets and alleys, the smoothness of waterways, and the arrangement of public health facilities, it is best to set up a health museum in every place where residents gather, with models, specimens, and posters of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, so that residents can often visit and observe them in order to imitate and improve. We should also hold more health lectures, inviting those with medical and health knowledge to give lectures often, using posters, statistical tables, slides, and other items to improve residents' health knowledge. Within the health agencies of the municipal government, a public health investigation and guidance department should be organized to conduct investigations and guidance on health matters in each resident's family, using both passive and active measures to improve the health of each resident. It is best to have a public hospital in every place, and this kind of organization should be attached to it. From this, the municipal government's public health budget should also be determined in advance, and ample funding should be raised to engage in this.</p>
<p>What has been said above is merely what I have felt and expressed randomly. As for the specific plan for carrying out health education, I will draft it when I have leisure to correct it with domestic experts and seek its realization.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Common Knowledge of Diseases - Q&amp;A <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(2) (15) Scarlet Fever (Continued)</p>
<p>(Q) Does the tongue of a scarlet fever patient have any special characteristics?</p>
<p>(A) Yes. In the prodromal stage, there is a peculiar grayish-white thick coating, which gradually peels off, and the entire surface becomes scarlet red with swollen papillae. (Called a cat tongue, also known as a raspberry tongue)</p>
<p>(Q) What changes occur in the patient's urine?</p>
<p>(A) The urine contains protein and ketone bodies.</p>
<p>(Q) What changes occur in the spleen?</p>
<p>(A) The spleen of scarlet fever patients has a mild swelling.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms in the recovery period?</p>
<p>(A) In the recovery period, there is flaky or membranous skin peeling. The areas that were first rashy peel first. That is, the neck peels off first.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the complications of scarlet fever patients?</p>
<p>(A) The most common complications are lesions in the throat, kidneys, heart, and joints.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the throat complications like?</p>
<p>(A) The throat becomes inflamed, ulcerated, with fibrin deposition, forming a yellowish-white coating, very similar to diphtheria.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the kidney complications like?</p>
<p>(A) Proteinuria appears early; nephritis comes in the third week, which is very important; at that time, the body temperature rises again, the face swells, the whole body swells, and symptoms such as ascites and pleural effusion appear. Urine output decreases; most have hemorrhagic urine. There is a large amount of protein in the urine, containing a large number of epithelial cells, cylinders, and blood cells. Uremia often occurs.</p>
<p>(Q) How many days does it take for this scarlet fever nephritis to heal itself?</p>
<p>(A) It takes one or two weeks to get better; it then transitions to secondary contracted kidneys.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the heart complications like?</p>
<p>(A) Heart complications often involve endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. The pulse is very frequent (sometimes reaching 140-150).</p>
<p>(Q) What are the joint complications like?</p>
<p>(A) The upper and lower limb joints, such as fingers and knees, show swelling, pain, fever, and even suppuration.</p>
<p>(Q) How does one approach the diagnosis of scarlet fever?</p>
<p>(A) Diagnosis is not very difficult by starting with high fever, angina, rash, raspberry tongue, membranous peeling, and swelling of the cervical lymph nodes.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the prognosis of scarlet fever, good or bad?</p>
<p>(A) Mostly unfavorable, with a mortality rate of about 3% to 10%. Cases with necrosis of the throat, kidney inflammation, and heart disease are all dangerous signs.</p>
<p>(Q) How should scarlet fever be treated?</p>
<p>(A) The patient should be ordered to rest quietly and prevent dryness in the room, allowing steam to dissipate within the sickroom. Food should be liquid or semi-liquid. Disinfectant ointment should be applied to the skin. Gargle with hydrogen peroxide or potassium chlorate water, apply an ice pack to the neck, and take diuretics and cardiac tonics internally. Injection of scarlet fever therapeutic serum is effective in the early stages. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e210">Can Kerosene Treat Lung Disease? <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng, from Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>There is a very bad trend in our country that must be recognized! That is, various undertakings in the country are lagging behind everywhere, but people like to adopt the latest theories from the West, blindly following them without careful examination. Therefore, in the past few decades, all culture has made no progress, which is truly lamentable!</p>
<p>Recently, in the medical field, I read in Shanghai newspapers that someone strongly advocated that kerosene can cure lung disease. As a result, many lung disease patients rashly tried it. I do not know the result, but to prevent harm and to think of patients suffering unnecessary pain, I must sincerely advise against it!</p>
<p>The idea that kerosene can treat disease was announced by Japanese individuals such as Hayami Toraichi and Iwamoto Yoshitora. It is a new therapy advocated in Japan. Lung disease is a very chronic and difficult-to-cure disease. Now that there is such a miraculously effective method, who would not gladly follow it? However, famous experts in Japan who possess the greatest authority in medical knowledge, after conducting detailed experiments, found that drinking kerosene is not only useless but also extremely dangerous.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Director of Pharmacology at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Tokyo, Hayashi Haruo, said: The treatment of lung disease lies entirely in recuperation. The kerosene treatment is completely a popular saying and a misrepresentation, and is extremely unreliable.</p>
<p>Dr. Hirai Fumio, a medical doctor at Keio Hospital in Japan, published a long article (see the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun, January 28, Showa 9), the conclusion of which stated that through various experiments, tubercle bacilli (結核菌) show greater resistance to lipoid substances than other bacteria. Kerosene is definitely not an effective bactericide. If patients like to drink kerosene, the bacteria will not be killed, and the valuable human life will be poisoned by kerosene, gradually heading towards death.</p>
<p>Dr. Arakawa Matajiro, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Tokyo, criticized the idea that kerosene can cure lung disease as pure superstition. He is worried and trembling for the 1.5 million patients across Japan. At the same time, Dr. Sato Hidesaburo, the Director of the Tuberculosis Department at the Institute of Infectious Diseases, criticized that using kerosene to treat lung disease is no different from telling patients to swallow mercuric chloride solution to cure lung disease, a similar tragedy.</p>
<p>Dr. Otani Akira, the Director of the Kitazato Institute Hospital, conducted experiments and said that this therapy has no basis. One might speculate that kerosene is a kind of stimulation therapy, similar to what common people call fish fever, garlic, sunlight, and hot spring baths, all of which belong to folk remedies passed down by word of mouth. However, in new medicine, the harms outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>Recently, I personally visited the Tokyo Municipal Sanatorium outside of the city and researched the possibility of using kerosene to treat lung disease. According to the director of the sanatorium, Tazawa Ryozo, long-term trials on 63 tuberculosis patients, starting with small doses and gradually giving appropriate doses, showed no effect. Furthermore, in some patients, a large dose was tried, which suddenly caused diarrhea and weakness. Many patients experienced belching and vomiting from drinking kerosene; many patients experienced worsened coughing and a slight increase in body temperature from drinking kerosene. Mr. Tazawa divided the tuberculosis patients into several groups: one group drank one 合 (0.18 liters) a day, one group drank once every other day, and one group drank once every three days. The results all caused gastrointestinal symptoms, and their drinking sometimes occurred before meals, sometimes after meals, and sometimes with milk. However, most patients stopped due to distress. During the period of kerosene intake, there were recurrences of hemoptysis. Mr. Tazawa published a trial report in the Japanese Medical News, extremely disapproving of the efficacy of kerosene in treating lung disease.</p>
<p>I am currently staying in Tokyo, investigating recent medical education in Japan. Upon receiving newspapers from my homeland, I found widespread theories about kerosene curing lung disease. Admitting that I do not have such experience, I am using the results of my investigation to sincerely announce it, so that my compatriots with lung disease in our country will not make unnecessary attempts again.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Physician Yang Yusheng specializes in internal medicine and has been running the West Lake Hospital in Hangzhou for many years, enjoying a great reputation in the field. This time, he went to Japan to investigate medical education and took the opportunity to record the problem of kerosene treatment of lung disease, which has been widely rumored in our country recently, for the reference of the people. This article was received from him from the East, and is specially introduced to society.</p>
<h3 id="e211">A Review of the Work of the Chinese Medical Association Over the Past Year <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Hengbi</p>
<p>Since the first general meeting of the Association was held in Shanghai in October of the 21st year, after its merger, fifteen months have passed. The work done during these fifteen months was largely defined by the general meeting. When implemented, broadly speaking, it concerned: 1. Consolidating the foundation of the Association; 2. Temporary resistance to medical administration; 3. Undertaking special research in Chinese medicine; 4. Encouraging the ethics of members; 5. Protecting and increasing the interests of members (four aspects); 6. Improving publishing and compiling medical handbooks (two aspects). Please allow me to briefly describe each item as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Repaying the Purchase Cost of the Association's Premises</p>
<p>The purchase cost of the Association's premises was 50,000 yuan, originally borrowed and paid by the Association. The Executive Committee resolved to raise funds to repay this amount. During and after the general meeting, approximately 43,000 yuan was raised. Among the members, the largest contribution was 2,800 yuan, and the smallest was 2 yuan. The number of donors reached two-thirds of all members, demonstrating that our members have a genuine understanding of the Association. Therefore, they were able to enthusiastically contribute and fully show their sincerity. The value of the enthusiasm and love for the Association demonstrated by those who donated two yuan is no different from those who donated two thousand eight hundred yuan. Those members who did not contribute before may have been too busy with public affairs, or the notice was not thorough, or they were unaware of the Association's fundraising efforts. It is certainly not a disregard for this effort. This kind of spirit is rarely seen in other academic organizations in our country. It is thought that, as of the date of writing, only a little over 7,000 yuan is still owed. If the members can continue to exert their remaining energy, each donating five yuan, it will be enough to repay the debt and have some left over. It is hoped that this amount can be raised before the next general meeting.</p>
<p>(2) Resistance to the Central Government's Formulation of Regulations for the National Medical Institute</p>
<p>The central government specially established the Ministry of Health to manage the national medical industry, with the intention of being supremely good. However, the National Medical Institute, a redundant organization, was also established. Its initial purpose was to organize traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, it has become increasingly intensified, and it has even demanded that the Executive Yuan divide the so-called "national medicine" and "national drugs" to be managed by the National Medical Institute, while the so-called "Western medicine" and "Western drugs" would still be managed by the Ministry of Health. The entire medical field would be arbitrarily divided into two. The so-called "national medicine" has absolutely no scientific basis, and its detrimental impact on the future of Chinese medicine is self-evident. Recognizing this, the Association specifically dispatched Doctors Niu Huisheng and Yan Fuqing to meet with Presidents Wang and Sun of the Executive and Legislative Yuans to strongly argue against it. They also presented petitions to the Legislative Yuan and sent letters to each legislator, stating the reasons why the regulations for the National Medical Institute should not be established. As a result, although there were many enlightened members of the Legislative Yuan who denounced its absurdity, there were still a few with preconceived notions who insisted on passing it. Although it was slightly different from the original proposal, it still inevitably regressed. This Association considers this to be a huge stain on our country's health administration.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting Medical Research Work</p>
<p>There are numerous medical problems in our country that need to be researched. If they are like scattered fragments, lacking a systematic approach, with each working independently and without connection, it will inevitably lead to a loss of both time and money. The Association specifically organized a Medical Research Committee to design research projects, and appointed Dr. H.G. Earle to oversee it. The research topic for this year is the statistics of epidemics. However, this work cannot be completed in one or two years. Therefore, the Association is raising additional funds to ensure that continuous investigation and research can be carried out, in order to increase the value of the work.</p>
<p>(4) Promoting and Encouraging Medical Ethics</p>
<p>New medicine in our country has only existed for about seventy or eighty years, a very short history. The practitioners in various places are of uneven quality, which has a significant impact on medical ethics. Seeing this trend, in order to protect the lives of the people and improve medical ethics, the Association's Reporting Committee carefully discussed and compiled a booklet of "Physician's Commandments," bound separately in Chinese and English, and sent it to each member as a guide. It also stipulates that if a member violates these commandments, the Association will give advice. If the advice is not followed, a warning will be issued. If the warning is ineffective, the member will be expelled from the Association in order to maintain the purity of all members. It is hoped that all members will deeply sympathize with this, accept the commandments, and put them into practice, so that the medical profession can forever maintain its sacred status.</p>
<p>(5) Editing Magazines</p>
<p>The articles published in the English section of the Association's magazine over the years have all been extremely valuable. Through Mr. Lin Zongyang's management for several years, the content has become increasingly refined. Since the merger of the two associations, the English magazine has been published independently. Not only must each member of the Association have a copy to read from time to time, but also all foreign medical magazines must select and excerpt important information for research. In the past year, this section has been the Association's foremost contribution to its members. In January of last year, with the permission of the members of the Peiping branch, if Mr. Lin travels abroad, other members in Peiping can take over the editorship. This is also very gratifying to all members.</p>
<p>The Association's Chinese magazine is also an important matter for members to publish their experiences and compile new medical knowledge. Thanks to the efforts of the chief editor, Mr. Li Tao, it has been improved to what it is today. Starting from this year, we are seeking further improvement. In addition to the original editors, the Executive Committee has also invited Mr. Yu Yunxiu, Pang Jingzhou, and Song Guobin to be editors, and approved Mr. Yu as the chief editor. It is stipulated that one issue will be published per month, in order to expand the original quality and quantity and to absorb and publish as much as possible the works of doctors who have studied in Germany, Japan, and France. Perhaps readers have also heard of this.</p>
<p>(6) Organizing and Conducting the Physician Training Institute</p>
<p>The number of graduates from medical schools in the country is no less than six or seven thousand. After graduation, there are often no opportunities for further study, which is a pity. The Association has specially raised considerable funds and jointly established the Physician Training Institute with the National Shanghai Medical College, Tongji University Medical College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Aurora University Medical College, Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, National Seaport Quarantine Office, Baolong Hospital, and other medical institutions in Shanghai. It brings together the talents and equipment of various institutions and groups to train various courses for doctors from home and abroad to study at the institute. The courses that have already been opened include pulmonary tuberculosis, internal medicine, orthopedics, public health, pathology, and biochemistry. The study period is at least three weeks and at most four months. The length of the courses depends entirely on the nature of the subject and the doctor's wishes. The total number of students has reached 40. It is hoped that in the future, those who are interested in studying will enthusiastically register for the courses. This is especially what we hope for.</p>
<p>(7) Guaranteeing the Business of Physicians</p>
<p>In recent years, doctors and patients often have disputes due to business relationships, and even become involved in lawsuits. There are often cases where patients fabricate charges against doctors with unfounded methods. In order to protect the legitimate interests of its members, the Association has repeatedly spoken out against injustice. To the best of its ability, it has devoted its full energy to dealing with it. For example, in the recent case of the dispute over cerebrospinal meningitis serum in Hefei, Dr. Zheng Xinjian of Hefei Hospital was accused. The Association impartially sought opinions from domestic experts after learning the truth of the matter. As a result, everyone agreed that Dr. Zheng had no errors in terms of academic theory. Therefore, the Association synthesized the opinions of various experts and submitted them to the court for analysis, and the injustice was revealed. Other similar cases are not unique. The Association has done its best to find ways to protect them, in order to fulfill its legal duty.</p>
<p>(8) Organizing and Expanding the Library</p>
<p>There is no large-scale specialized library of medical books in the country. Especially in Shanghai, there are many Chinese and foreign doctors, but the books available for reference are very incomplete. Even if there are one or two institutions with considerable collections, the types are often biased towards the aspects they particularly focus on. Those who are not experts in a certain field cannot use them, and the effect of popularization is ultimately impossible to achieve. The Association has specifically opened a library within the Association to widely collect and store books. In the shortest possible time, it plans to comprehensively collect all the medical books from schools and institutions in Shanghai and compile a general catalog for the reference of members in various places.</p>
<p>(9) Compiling, Translating, and Selling Medical Books</p>
<p>The Association's Compilation and Translation Department was originally merged from the former Bo Yi Hui Compilation and Translation Department. However, in order to increase publishing, the Association specially raised funds and hired Mr. Huang Yiqing, who has extensive experience in compiling and translating medical books, to join the work. A medical book distribution office was also specially established within the Association to promote sales and facilitate direct ordering by members.</p>
<p>(10) Compiling the Fourth Edition of the Medical Guide</p>
<p>The Medical Guide has been published in three editions. With each edition, the information has been continuously increased. The increase in the collection for the fourth edition is even greater. The original single volume had to be divided into two parts: a Chinese version and an English version. The Chinese version has already been printed. It contains address maps of important cities with sixteen maps, a survey of the conditions of twenty-six medical colleges, an overview of the health agencies under the Ministry of Health and the Health Laboratory Department, a concise survey of hospitals in various provinces with four hundred and twenty-four entries, a directory of the names and addresses of more than four thousand physicians, as well as a record of the medical schools surveyed, various important medical regulations, and a catalog of national medical and pharmaceutical periodicals currently in circulation. The wealth of information collected far exceeds the third edition. The English version has also been started and is expected to be published around June or July.</p>
<p>In other matters, such as members registering with the Ministry of Health and applying for certificates, the Association has handled no less than 200 cases in the past year. The medical community has held more than 100 meetings in the Association. Running around and making arrangements has also been quite busy. However, the staff of the Association believes that the Association is organized by colleagues in the medical community, and of course, it should do its best to serve the medical community. If the members have any requests, they will naturally do their best to serve and not be afraid of hard work.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Experiments on Curing Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Kerosene (Fourth Continuation) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>(5) I Tried It Because I Was Told by a Patient That Kerosene Can Cure Lung Disease</p>
<p>(I Am Also One of Those Who Tried Taking Kerosene Myself and Believe It Is Effective)</p>
<p>Talk by Dr. Chiba Masayoshi, Internal Medicine, Settsu Hospital, Kobe City</p>
<p>Kerosene is harmless to the human body. I knew this when I saw a car driver calmly drink gasoline when I was a student. There was a case of a child accidentally drinking kerosene, and his parents panicked and didn't know what to do. I told them about this and reassured them. But I was told by a patient that kerosene can cure lung disease. To this day, I have examined three patients who have tried drinking kerosene. Among them, there were also those who had fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. But there has not been a worst-case scenario. Most of the results are good.</p>
<p>I myself also used kerosene five watts, drunk three times, because I had abnormalities in the pulmonary hilar lymph nodes. I felt very good and went about my business as usual. I thought I was cured by drinking kerosene.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of drinking kerosene, I think it is better to use inhalation. I also hope to collect X-ray photographs of the therapeutic effect of drinking kerosene and prove it from an academic point of view.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>(Postscript by a Friend of the Fang Woman Reporter)</p>
<p>This magazine received a letter from a reader in Kyushu, saying: I heard that kerosene can cure lung disease. Is this true? I was asked to investigate. At first, the reporter thought, how can kerosene cure lung disease? I was afraid to believe it. But because I was entrusted by others, I should naturally conduct a thorough investigation. After starting the investigation, I was surprised by the certainty of its effect.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason, since there is such a fact, it is naturally impossible to bury it. Moreover, this kerosene therapy is neither a new therapy promoted for profit, nor is it a new drug. It is a therapy that almost does not require spending money.</p>
<p>This therapy can also be said to be the most suitable therapy for the poor. In the past, most therapies, no matter how reasonable and ideal, were often beyond the reach of the poor.</p>
<p>However, what is published here is a kerosene therapy that costs absolutely nothing. Wouldn't it make people jump for joy?</p>
<p>After investigating the experiments of kerosene therapy in curing diseases, there are many examples, almost too many to record. Due to the length of the article, I will stop here for now and continue the report in the February issue (the February issue was not published and was postponed to the March issue). (End)</p>
<h3 id="e213">Overview of Shanghai Shinyi Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory Co., Ltd. <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Shinyi Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory Co., Ltd. was initially founded by Dr. Xiafei, a German Doctor of Pharmacy. Since the 19th year of the Republic of China, under the advocacy of Mr. He Zikang and Mr. Bao Guochang, foreign shares were recovered and a fully Chinese-owned joint-stock company was established. The trademark was set as "Changming Brand" and re-registered with the Ministry of Industry. Thanks to the efforts of the two gentlemen, the internal organization was reorganized and expanded as much as possible. The products were excellent and the business flourished. By the 22nd year, it had successfully become a giant in China's new pharmaceutical industry. The progress and development in the 22nd year were particularly astonishing. If the situation is peaceful and the economy develops in the future, the future is immeasurable. Now, the overview of the factory is divided into equipment, manufacturing, and business departments, and the main points are described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e214">Equipment <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The factory's foundation was originally operated by German pharmaceutical manufacturing experts and was extremely complete. Over the years, it has been added to and enriched. In the past year, Mr. He and Mr. Bao have spared no effort to expand it. All kinds of chemical testing and manufacturing instruments and machinery have been purchased with the latest and most perfect equipment. Even at the expense of existing machinery with proven performance, for the sake of improving, they resolutely replaced them with the latest machines invented by pharmaceutical factories around the world. This is still the first application in our country. The two gentlemen are purely operating this new business with the spirit of scientific work. The innovation of medicine is the key to strengthening the nation. They do not focus on the meager profits of the present. To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools. This has been the case since ancient times. In today's world of rapid scientific advancement, how can we ignore the machinery that is the foundation of manufacturing? Therefore, the factory has everything it should have. It can be said to be second to none in our country. From raw materials to finished drugs, every medicine is made by machine and powered by electricity. Dr. Xiafei, the technician, is a world-renowned scholar. Based on his thirty years of research and experience, he is responsible for supervising the production of various products. As for other Chinese and Western experts, they can all use what they have learned and do their best. For the work of research and testing, they all explore based on the principles of pharmacology and physiology, and sacrifice a lot of money, time, and brainpower, regardless of the cost, in order to win the final reputation and success. Under the leadership of Mr. He, all employees of the factory can cooperate in division of labor. Even male and female workers are trained before starting work and are not allowed to operate rashly. They are supervised by technical personnel and adopt a purely scientific management method. Therefore, it is well-organized. Its complexity and refinement cannot be compared to any manufacturing work. The speed of its expansion is a model for the mechanical manufacturing industry. But its cost is also considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Manufacturing <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The perfection of the factory's equipment is as described above. But without talents to use its equipment, it is in vain. Therefore, the factory spares no expense to hire various specialized talents. Even for the animals used for testing, research, and raw material acquisition, a veterinarian is hired full-time, and a special veterinarian is required for temporary needs. The clinical research department, which experiments with new drug products, also has full-time specialist doctors from various departments under special contract. Its caution and rigor are so great. The rest can be inferred. If it is unavoidable to borrow talent from other countries, it is because there is a shortage of talent in our country, especially pharmaceutical technology talent. There are indeed knowledgeable and skilled people, but they are not enough to control. The country still has guest ministers. It should not be a problem for the factory and should be deeply understood. The factory's equipment and talent are equally difficult. It is appropriate that the products are excellent and can compete with imported products. All kinds of internal and external use, pills, tablets, powders, liquids, injections, etc. can be made by themselves. Among the products that have been made and praised and used by Chinese and Western doctors, the injection is just one item. There are already more than one hundred kinds. One-third of them were made in the past year. In addition to the famous Cibaoming, Vitamin Cibaoming pills, etc., the most famous new products, such as Vitamin Cibaoming injection, Fuvanein made from ovarian follicular internal secretion crystalline, Liver Lifter injection, powder and liquid made from liver crystalline, Healthy God Nourishing Blood Sugar Plasma, Labor Pain Inducer made from self-collected raw materials, Pituitary Cord Injection, Changming New Ga Injection chemically made, internal powder, etc. are unique in China. The most valuable of the factory's special products is Vitamin B crystalline preparation. The crystalline of Vitamin B is still the latest success in the world scientific community. The factory was able to extract Vitamin B from rice bran and silver skin in the winter of the 21st year and then successfully make the purest crystalline. Then, it is made into injections and tablets. Such a great success is not only the honor of the factory, but also enough for our country in the era of medical and pharmaceutical budding to raise its eyebrows in the world scientific community. There are many such excellent crystalline products in the factory. They are all new products in the past year and are not easy to come by.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Business <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The factory's business has been developing since the 19th year and has been increasing year by year. The speed of its expansion is due to the booming industry and the needs of the environment. In the past year, due to the excellent performance of the products, the variety of products, and the tide of resisting foreign goods, the people of the country have patriotism. The medical community has all received the highest education and are excellent members of the intellectual class. The results of resisting foreign goods are easier to become consistent in fact. Therefore, in addition to this city, the factory has representatives residing in major cities in the country.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Bayer Pharmaceutical's World's First Suspended Electric Light Sign <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Bayer Pharmaceutical recently suspended a great steel wire mesh between the two major chimneys of its Leverkusen plant and attached small blacks that moved sequentially like spider silk on it. Since this device appeared there, the general residents have been looking up at the sky in recent weeks, vying to look up and admire its magnificence and grandeur, which is beyond reach. According to the expert, these small blacks, like stars, are composed of hundreds of light bulbs. When the night falls, it emits light and shows Bayer's crisscross cross in the sky, shining brightly with great light. The circumference has a diameter of 230 feet, and each letter of Bayer's crisscross cross is 36 feet. Each side of this electric light sign has a Bayer's crisscross cross. However, because it is back-to-back, and one side of the light bulb is painted with aluminum paint to darken it, it can make both sides an absolutely clear electric light circle. Each crisscross cross uses 1,100 light bulbs, for a total of 2,200 bulbs. However, the actual current used is very small. The circumference of the two circles should be 720 feet. To facilitate climbing this electric light spider web, there is a bucket-style elevator. However, this is after the construction is completed. If it was built at first, then anyone who engaged in this project would have to climb the chimney, which is 415 feet high. According to the top of the two towering chimneys, there is at least a foot and a half of swing, and the diameter from the outer edge to the outer edge is 18 feet. How dangerous is it for those who work on it? However, the chimney craftsmen are all accustomed to this kind of movement and do not care at all, and proceed with their work calmly. This is also difficult and commendable. As for the net with electric lights, it is slowly raised and placed in its fixed position after the support cable is aligned. It is conceivable how difficult the project is to suspend such a great steel net in such a high altitude. Furthermore, because the net is extremely fine, it can be guaranteed not to be affected by the wind due to its excessive area. Therefore, even if it is suspended in the air, there is no danger of shaking.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Overview of Textile Import Trade in the 22nd Year <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Zixiu</p>
<p>Import trade in the 22nd year showed a general downward trend, with the decrease in textiles being particularly significant.</p>
<p>Total Imports   Textiles   Other</p>
<p>21st Year   891   223   668</p>
<p>22nd Year   690   117   573</p>
<p>(Unit: Million Customs Gold Units)</p>
<p>The total of other goods decreased by only 14%, while textiles alone decreased by as much as 48%. In the 21st year, textiles accounted for about one-quarter of the total value of imported goods, which decreased to 17% in the 22nd year. Most textile goods are consumer goods for clothing. Under the circumstances of sluggish rural economy and years of international trade deficit, this situation can be considered somewhat satisfactory. The ups and downs of the main items are briefly analyzed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Turning over the import trade statistics, the first thing one sees is cotton cloth. In the past few decades, the total import value of cotton cloth often ranged from 1.1 million to 2 million dan, with a value of tens of millions of taels, rightfully occupying the leading position. However, in recent years, it has decreased year by year, and the import value is no longer what it used to be. In the 21st year, imports were still more than 800,000 dan, worth more than 60 million Customs Gold Units; in the 22nd year, it further decreased to 30 million Customs Gold Units, and the estimated quantity must already be within 500,000 dan, only 20-30% of what it once was. Examining the Customs Trade Monthly Report item by item, the import volume in the 22nd year compared with the 21st year can almost be said to have decreased uniformly across dozens of items. The only exceptions are wide-width foreign yarn, floral prints, unlisted printed cloth, and striped poplin. Even these four items each have special reasons. Wide-width foreign yarn was originally mostly used as material for making handkerchiefs, and its value was particularly low. The import tax could not be levied ad valorem according to ordinary foreign yarn, and its ad valorem tax rate was relatively light due to the low original price, so import trade was concentrated on wide-width products. If we combine the calculation of both wide and narrow items, we can know that the import value has indeed decreased and not increased (the figures are roughly the same). Most of the floral prints imported were Russian goods. The quality of Russian goods is relatively thick, and the use is close to that of printed twill, unlike British and Japanese goods. The increase in the import of Russian floral prints in the 22nd year is in stark contrast to the sharp decline in Japanese printed twill. The increase in the import of striped poplin is due to the simple classification of the old tariff rules, where all dyed yarn products were subject to ad valorem tax, which was light, so striped poplin replaced bleached plain silk. As for the increase in unlisted printed cloth, it is due to the trickery of double-sided printed cloth. Ordinary double-sided printed cloth is only for sporadic decorative use, so the old tariff rules classified it as unlisted products and levied ad valorem tax. The ad valorem tax was reduced invisibly due to the impact of the decline in the original price, so ordinary printed cloth that originally did not need double-sided printing also deliberately made double-sided printing to take advantage of it, and unlisted printed cloth thus increased sharply. In summary, it can be seen that the so-called increase is the result of item transfer and is not enough to affect the general judgment of reduction. There are approximately two important reasons for the general decrease in cotton cloth. First, it is human nature that those with better living conditions first pay attention to clothing. Conversely, economic difficulties naturally lead to savings in clothing, abandoning high-end imported products and switching to cheaper domestic products. This is to be expected. Second, the domestic industry was originally more prosperous in cotton textile industry. Before the autonomy of tariffs, imported cotton yarn had already declined with the increase in domestic production. In recent years, tariffs have been repeatedly increased, and the import value of cotton cloth has decreased accordingly, which is quite natural. The current tariff rules are about half as high as the previous tariff rules, and they were implemented at the end of May of the 22nd year. The import volume of cotton cloth in the second half of the 22nd year was 8 million Customs Gold Units, which is about half less than in the first half of the year. Therefore, the future trend of cotton cloth import trade can be imagined. The import volume of cotton cloth since the founding of the Republic of China is listed on the left. (Unit: Dan)</p>

<p>21st Year   816,719</p>
<p>22nd Year   450,000 (Approx.)</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>The import volume of cotton in the 22nd year was more than 1.99 million dan, which is much less than in the previous years. In the previous years, the import volume increased sharply to 3-4 million dan, which some considered an unusual situation. Now it has decreased sharply to 2 million dan, which may be considered a return to normal. However, in my opinion, the sharp increase in the import volume of cotton in the previous years was not unexpected, except for the hundreds of thousands of dan that were imported due to the extremely low price, which can be regarded as unusual. Today's sharp decline is an extraordinary state. Why do I say that? Because the supply and demand of cotton and yarn are mutually dependent, and the import of yarn and cloth is the import of cotton, but the form is different, and there is not much difference in substance. According to the import statistics of the most recent 20 years, although cotton was only hundreds of thousands of dan in the early years of the Republic of China, both yarn and cloth were around 2 million dan, and the direct and indirect import volume of foreign cotton was already in the range of 4-5 million dan. Since the European War, the import of cotton yarn has decreased sharply, so the import of cotton has gradually increased to 2 million dan. In recent years, cotton yarn has decreased from hundreds of thousands of dan to tens of thousands of dan, and cotton cloth has also decreased sharply by 1 million dan, so the import of cotton has increased sharply to about 4 million dan. The amount of indirect imports in disguised form has decreased, while direct imports have increased, and the total amount is often in the range of 4.5 million dan, so it is said that the sharp increase in the import of cotton in the previous years was not unexpected. As for the sharp increase in the import volume of cotton in the 22nd year, it is due to the accidental phenomenon of the increase in domestic cotton production, which is very similar to the situation during the European War. According to the estimate of the Yarn Factory Association, the average cotton production in China in the most recent 20 years is about 7.7 million dan. During the European War, it once increased sharply to 10 million dan. At that time, the direct and indirect import volume of foreign cotton also decreased to more than 2.8 million dan. In the 22nd year, the estimated domestic cotton production reached 9.7 million dan. At the same time, the direct import volume of cotton was about 2 million dan, and the indirect import volume and the import volume of the three eastern provinces were each tens of thousands, which should be similar to the number of 2.8 million dan. A good cotton harvest depends on the weather. How long can this accidental phenomenon last? It depends on the earnest work of the cotton industry authorities. Otherwise, the good times will not last long, and the import volume of cotton may not always be within 2 million dan in the future. The direct and indirect import volume of cotton in each year is listed on the left. (Unit: Thousand Dan)</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The import volume of cotton yarn has been small in recent years. In the 21st year, due to the relationship of discounted goods, the import of British fine yarn once increased, but in the 22nd year, it returned to the normal state of decline. The total import volume for the whole year was 27,700 dan, of which most were high-end fine yarns, except for the ordinary goods still exported to various ports in the southwest. Judging from the general trend of cotton yarn trade, imported goods are no longer important. The import volume in each year is shown in the table below. (Unit: Thousand Dan)</p>
<p>Average from the 1st to the 4th Year   2,595</p>
<p>Average from the 5th to the 8th Year   1,770</p>

<p>21st Year   96</p>
<p>22nd Year   28</p>
<p>Hemp Goods</p>
<p>Imported hemp goods can be roughly divided into two categories: coarse and fine. Coarse hemp goods are mainly hemp bags made of jute. The annual import volume in China is about 1 million dan. In the 22nd year, imports were only tens of thousands of dan. There are two reasons for this. First, hemp is mostly used for packaging agricultural products, and the demand in the three eastern provinces is the largest, accounting for about 70% of the total. Now it is no longer included in this figure. Second, the import of rice, wheat, and other products has been considerable in recent years, reaching 40 million dan annually. These goods are mostly packaged in hemp bags. Counting 1% of the packaging weight, the annual import volume has reached 400,000 dan. No wonder the import volume of empty bags has plummeted. Fine hemp goods are mostly linen fabrics, most of which are used for embroidery, and a small part is used for Western clothing. In recent years, the export trade of embroidery products has been very prosperous, and Western clothing materials such as linen canvas and linen flannel are also active in the market. Therefore, the import volume of linen has increased from more than 2 million yards in the 21st year to more than 4.3 million yards in the 22nd year.</p>
<p>Wool Yarn</p>
<p>The total import value in the 22nd year was more than 53,000 dan, which is a very slight decrease compared to more than 54,000 dan in the 21st year. This is because the world wool prices were very cheap in the spring of the 22nd year, and domestic sales gradually shifted from undershirts to underwear and outerwear, and from winter to spring and autumn. In the past two years, the domestic production of domestic goods has increased day by day, and imported goods are also actively seeking local manufacturing. Although the domestic consumption may increase rapidly, the import volume may not necessarily increase sharply.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Woolen Fabrics <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The total import value of woolen fabrics in the 22nd year was about 31,000 dan, which is a slight increase compared to 29,000 dan in the 21st year. The reasons can be attributed to both production and sales. In recent years, Japan's import of raw wool has increased sharply. Based on its special experience in mousseline, it is natural to engage in the export trade of plain woolen fabrics. As for the change in clothing, although ordinary robes and jackets have adopted less woolen fabrics in recent years due to the increase in tariffs and the low price of silk, the gradual transition of the entire form to semi-Western style is still in progress. The most obvious example is the popularity of outerwear in spring and autumn. Modern men and women each have one, and 80-90% of the materials used are imported woolen fabrics.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk</p>
<p>The import volume of artificial silk in the 22nd year was more than 69,000 dan, which is about 30% less than 100,000 dan in the previous year. This is the surface figure, but in fact, it has not decreased. Japanese artificial silk exports have always been mainly to China. According to Japanese export statistics, more than 25,000 dan were exported to mainland China in the 21st year of the Republic of China, and more than 2,700 dan were exported to the three eastern provinces. In the 22nd year, the quantity exported to mainland China by September was only more than 3,000 dan, but the quantity exported to the three eastern provinces increased sharply to more than 29,000 dan. Furthermore, the import volume of the three eastern provinces by November in the 20th year was more than 44,000 dan. There is absolutely no reason for the figure of the three eastern provinces to increase tenfold in one year. It is self-evident that there is a lot of smuggling and re-export. This is specifically for Japanese goods. If we include the number of Western goods smuggled from Hong Kong and other places, it can be concluded that the import volume of artificial silk has increased secretly while decreasing apparently.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Recent Situation of the Enamel Industry <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>The business volume of the Shanghai enamel industry in the 22nd year was a total of 4.27 million yuan in national currency; estimated:</p>
<p>Yiji Enamel Factory   1.1 million yuan</p>
<p>Huafeng Enamel Factory  950,000 yuan</p>
<p>Zhonghua Enamel Factory  750,000 yuan</p>
<p>Jiuxin Enamel Factory  460,000 yuan</p>
<p>Zhufeng Tongji Enamel Company 400,000 yuan</p>
<p>Shanghai Enamel Factory  340,000 yuan</p>
<p>Zhaofeng Enamel Factory  120,000 yuan</p>
<p>Other six small factories  150,000 yuan</p>
<p>Although the above amount is not as prosperous as in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China, it has increased by 20% compared with the 21st year of the Republic of China. In this autumn of rural bankruptcy and unrest in various provinces, this achievement is beyond initial expectations. However, this is only one area of production, (according to my country's enamel manufacturing factories, which are all in Shanghai) and the sales are to the whole country. The business income is only this number, and I am also not satisfied. One is that the sales lines have not been widespread over the years and have not penetrated into the people; the other is that farmers have a lack of understanding and still do not know how to use it, or even mistakenly believe that it is a noble product. In fact, after many observations, enamel utensils are most needed and most suitable for farmers. Not only are they durable and inexpensive, they are far better than bulky porcelain and bamboo and wooden utensils. Almost all kinds of enamel utensils meet the needs of the countryside, even if enamel round and square plates are used to dry flour, and large and small pots can also be used to store seeds, which cannot be invaded by tides and cannot be harmed by insects and rats. Asking about their value, they are all cheaper than bamboo and wooden utensils. However, among the farmers who can use enamel utensils now. There is not one in a hundred people. Therefore, if the enamel industry wants to develop in the future, it must first vigorously promote it to farmers. If this can be done, not to mention the annual turnover of more than 4 million yuan, even the daily turnover of more than 4 million yuan is not difficult.</p>
<p>The enamel industry is an emerging industry in our country. During the European War, it rose after the Japanese. In the past ten years, it has been catching up rapidly. So far, except for the area of ​​Northern Tianjin and Pingjin, where Japanese enamel products are still sold, Japanese enamel products in Southern China and the Yangtze River area have long been extinct. In the beginning, in order to jointly resist Japanese goods, all those who could cooperate with the industry did not unite in spirit and move forward bravely. Past facts are clearly verifiable, but each factory has different historical reasons, resulting in different interests. In addition, with the changes in personnel, suspicion arises. Since the joint business office of domestic enamel products was terminated for some reason last summer, the general public believed that the termination was a pity, given the difficulties in concluding the contract. However, if the form is separated but the spirit can be combined, it is like brothers dividing their families, and there is no harm. Therefore, since each factory has operated individually, they have all stated that they will maintain the turnover of the previous year, so as to achieve balanced development, neither infringing on others nor showing their weaknesses. And in their trade association. In order to prevent problems before they occur, we will further restrict the production of each factory, so as not to make their goods surplus, and then compete for outlets, leading to the bad habit of devaluation and competitive sales. Over the years, fortunately, everything has been safe. Starting from the 23rd year, we will further try to implement production control. The restriction of production in the previous year is only to revise the details: for the purchase of raw materials, we plan to jointly purchase them. Not only will the wholesale price be cheaper, but all kinds of raw materials used will also be standardized from now on.</p>
<p>The price of enamel products is uniform throughout the industry. Compared with previous years, the Shanghai market has been declining, and the rural economy of the provinces is on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to cater to the psychology of buyers, the industry has created secondary products in addition to genuine goods: it is cheaper than genuine goods, so it is convenient for ordinary people to purchase. Last year, the sales in the Nanyang area were fortunately for this secondary product. Not only did the sales increase greatly, but the Japanese goods were greatly robbed, because the prices were the same, and the quality of our goods was better than that of Japan, and no one asked about Japanese goods. Therefore, the sales of the enamel industry in the spring and summer of last year were the best in the Nanyang area. Fujian and Guangdong were also not bad. However, the Yangtze River area and Sichuan province were very deserted. Judging from the business situation over the years, during the summer and autumn, the Yangtze River gang was a trading area, and no one was not excited for a while, but last year it was so lonely, which was not expected by the factories at the beginning. After summer went away and autumn came, it was still immobile. At this time, the trading period of the South China gang had passed, the inventory of each factory was piling up, the business was stagnant, and the economy was panicked. In view of the effectiveness of price reduction in the past, I had no choice but to reduce the price again, which was named a special price category. First, the accumulated second-class goods and test products of each factory were included in the special price category for sale. With a publicity, buyers followed. However, the above-mentioned second-class goods and test products are limited, so how can they be popularized? Helplessly, buyers only seek cheap prices and do not care about the workmanship. If they do not continue to sell, no one will ask about genuine and secondary goods. They have no choice but to reluctantly treat the secondary goods as special goods to meet the sales. The turnover in September and October was about 2 million yuan, which is almost half of the annual turnover. Because of a slight price reduction, it was so popular that I don't know why. After investigation, it was found that the trafficking households had seen through the weakness and used it to coerce, which was no different from being used by them. Since January 28, the financial resources of the business community in various ports have been tight, which cannot be denied. All trafficking businesses are unwilling to wholesale goods. And in their warehouses, there is no shortage of storage, which can still be used for sale, and it is not too late to wholesale after the sale is completed. January 28 is almost two years ago, and the inventory of trafficking merchants in various ports is gradually sold out. I am worried that there is no way to meet the market, and I am about to wholesale from the Shanghai factory. Therefore, even if the enamel products at this time are not reduced in price again, there will be a large number of sales, but it may not be crowded in September and October. The enamel bottle industry, due to a temporary over-worry, unnecessarily sacrificed the price of goods and silver to about 400,000 yuan, which is also a small lesson learned by the industry in the 22nd year. However, in this era of advocating domestic goods, small profits and more sales are the right way; if you lose the east corner, it is not difficult to recover the mulberry elm.</p>
<p>Our country's enamel products were originally imitated from the East. For more than ten years, we have spared no effort to research and improve them, and we have long been better than the blue and on par with Europe and the United States. However, because sales are mostly in the upper and middle classes, we strive to improve the styles and patterns. Taking the washbasin as an example, there were only flat-edged and rolled-edged shapes at the beginning, but now we have advanced to make deep-shaped flared edges and other styles. The patterns used to be only blue flowers and ice flowers, but now, in addition to electro-optical printing, spraying, and more, we have advanced to make pile tea and gold trim styles. As for the color, the more it is made, the better it is, bright and dazzling, unprecedented　People in northern China have always liked to use copper washbasins, and each one costs 3-4 yuan, saying that although the value is high, there are more than ten taels of waste copper that can be sold for a price after it is damaged. Therefore, the copper workshops in the City God Temple area of ​​Shanghai can sell 40,000 copper basins to the north every year. Since the sale of deep-shaped enamel washbasins last year, the above-mentioned copper basins have been greatly affected, and many have changed from copper to enamel.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Economy of Soviet Russia in 1933 <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xianxu</p>
<p>The most noteworthy event for Soviet Russia last year was the further consolidation of its international standing. On the one hand, relations with Germany have progressed compared to before. On the other hand, France and various Eastern European countries successively concluded treaties of friendship with Soviet Russia. Furthermore, the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia in November was a significant event both economically and politically.</p>
<p>Last year, Soviet Russia still focused on improving its domestic economy and financial policies. While progress in industrial construction was steady, it devoted great effort to promoting all previously established enterprises. In industry, although the increase in production rate was only 16%, the overall production increase rate reached 22%. According to official figures, last year, the income of general industrial workers increased by 9.1%, while heavy industry saw an increase of 11.5%. Labor productivity in major industries increased by 10.2%, and production costs decreased by 1.5% to 2%. The reason for the increase in labor productivity is because a law was enacted in 1932 to severely crack down on unwarranted absenteeism by workers and employees. In other words, bread coupons were not issued to any staff who were absent from work without a valid reason.</p>
<p>Observing the entire industry, last year was indeed quite successful. However, some sectors failed to complete their planned production schedules. The steel industry only completed 78%, the forestry industry only 78.6%, the glass industry 71.6%, and the textile industry 95.4%. According to the Second Five-Year Plan, the output of major industries should increase by 21% this year, heavy industry by 23%, light industry by 10.6%, and the production of general consumer goods should increase by 16%.</p>
<p>Regarding the financial part of the 1933 fiscal year, the budget anticipated revenues of 35 billion rubles and expenditures of 32 billion rubles. In reality, revenue reached 39.2 billion rubles, and expenditures were 36 billion rubles. The business tax of state industrial and commercial organizations, which was originally the largest source of Soviet Russia's national revenue, exceeded the original estimate by 1.2 billion. Furthermore, an additional 2 billion rubles of income exceeded the planned sales of food and manufactured goods. There was also 600 million rubles from the sale of national bonds. The actual expenditure exceeded the budgeted expenditure by 1.5 billion rubles, which was used for the development of economic enterprises. Local budgets increased by 400 million, and the salaries of agricultural workers exceeded 200 million rubles. As for this year's (1934) budget, the anticipated revenue is 48,879,416,000 rubles, and the anticipated expenditure is 47,308,416,000 rubles, with 1,571,000,000 rubles as a reserve fund. As observed from the budget, economic enterprises increased from 24,865,900,000 to 33,345,700,000 rubles. Social and educational undertakings increased from 2,341,300,000 to 3,016,000,000 rubles. Administrative expenses increased from 2,400,500,000 to 2,889,800,000 rubles. The increase in military spending was not significant, rising from 1,416,600,000 to 1,665,000,000 rubles. However, we cannot draw any conclusions from this, as there is still a reserve of 11,360,850,000 rubles in the heavy industry sector. This could be allocated to increase military spending at any time.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's international balance of payments improved last year compared to before. In the three years before 1933, international trade had been characterized by trade deficits. We can see this from the following (in units of 1,000 gold rubles):</p>
<p>1930　　　　　1931　　　　　1932</p>
<p>Exports　　　　1,036,371　　　811,210　　　563,844</p>
<p>Imports　　　　1,058,825　　　1,105,034　　　698,693</p>
<p>The complete statistics for 1933 have not yet been compiled. However, exports for the first nine months totaled 367,364,000 rubles, and imports totaled 274,285,000 rubles. This resulted in a trade surplus of 93,097,000 rubles. The trade deficit of previous years has now turned into a surplus. On the import side, various countries have reduced their exports. The UK's exports to Soviet Russia in the first nine months totaled only 24,988,000 rubles, while the same period in 1932 was 71,401,000 rubles. The decrease amounted to more than 46 million. Germany's exports decreased from 254,255,000 to 131,483,000 rubles.</p>
<p>According to Stalin's declaration, Soviet Russia's commercial debt abroad at one point reached 1.4 billion rubles. By 1933, this commercial debt had been reduced to just over 450 million rubles. Soviet Russia is also a gold-producing country, and it is estimated that its current annual output is over 100 million gold rubles.</p>
<p>Last year, Soviet Russia's agricultural development was surprisingly successful. Both the spring and winter harvests were excellent. The Soviet authorities consider this to be an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to the latest official statistics, the harvest of major agricultural products in 1930 was 83,540,000 tons, in 1931 it was 69,480,000 tons, in 1932 it was 69,870,000 tons, and in 1933 it was 89,800,000 tons. Before the European War, Soviet Russia's most abundant harvest was in 1913, which was 80,100,000 tons. Therefore, the harvests of 1931 and 1932 were both about 10 million tons less. The official claim is that the food consumed by the people is greater than before the European War, especially with the rapid increase in population, which has increased by 25 million since 1913. However, it is undeniable that the harvests of 1931 and 1932 were less than any year before the revolution in 1914. The production of barley in 1933 was 7.5 million tons more than in 1932, and wheat was 4 million tons more.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's tax system has now been changed to in-kind taxation, which is of considerable benefit to the people. Furthermore, because the leading talents of Soviet Russia are all able to fulfill their duties and strive for improvement, it is no wonder that the country's progress is so rapid.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Securities Last Week: Government Bonds Continuously Reached New High Prices <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Distorted development...The golden age</p>
<p>Last week, from March 26th to 31st, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, happened to be the last day of early March, with settlement in between, and May was just making its debut. During this transition period, the bond market fluctuated significantly. The "Ninety-Six Affair" was particularly fierce. The trend was favorable, and the high market price did not diminish the strong appetite for more. New high prices emerged one after another, advancing steadily, with a momentum suggesting that the Salt Tax would not stop until it was below 70%. Commercial depression, with government bonds developing in such a distorted manner, reaching its peak, can be called the golden age. Whether the future will continue to develop, hover temporarily, or fall back immediately, is all possible. Speculators also have a dilemma of advancing and retreating. However, the majority of both long and short positions, big players, and those holding long positions have real strength, with short-term speculative profits in mind. There are also many major short sellers preparing to deliver, with longer-term speculative thoughts. Based on this speculation, unless the environment changes, the market price is unlikely to undergo major changes, with a greater component of hovering stability. We will wait until after the events of April to start the contention between long and short positions. The "Ninety-Six Affair" was short, quick, and has passed, but while the various bond markets are advancing rapidly, there is still a state of continuing struggle. Rumors in the market should not be easily believed. Last week, Monday was the last day of March futures, with a slight short squeeze, around half a yuan. However, the "Ninety-Six" rose sharply, surging two yuan and then plunging one yuan and seven and a half jiao, completely manipulated by speculators. Actions outside the settlement are not worth discussing in depth. On Tuesday, only April was traded, as 35 and 50 numbers had an appetite, unanimously rising several jiao to more than one yuan. On Wednesday, only April was still traded, and the trading was not quiet. The 38, 42, and 54 numbers gradually emerged, and the incoming players also had considerable strength. The market price fluctuated slightly, two to three jiao. The "Ninety-Six" continued to fall by seven jiao. Thursday was a market closure for the settlement of March futures. From Friday onwards, May futures began to appear, and trading gradually increased. The opening of the head plate, various forward trades were very lively. The appetite of major players became stronger, and the market price still had the appearance of rising step by step. Various bonds have once again seen new high prices. Cutting troops continued to rise by nine jiao. Although the head plate was seen to return slightly on Saturday, it gradually rose thereafter. Although the market price is high, the appetite has not decreased. If the major short sellers do not have real strength, there is still the possibility of a sharp rise. Everything once again saw a new high price. Over the course of a week, sellers such as 38, 43, and 54 numbers were very enthusiastic, faintly hearing of prepared sales amounts, which are quite large. However, limited price and unlimited amount, will not cause waves for the time being. Most of the buyers are covering short positions, such as 4, 20, and 35 numbers, all of which have real strength. In this situation of equal strength, a slight change in the environment can be used to apply skills, but now is not the time. The result of the market price, compared to the previous week, March only traded for one day, recording a return of a small number of jiao to more than one yuan. April uniformly rose several jiao to more than one yuan. May is a newly opened position, with a total transaction volume of 79.15 million yuan, of which spot goods are only 5,000 yuan. The high and low price fluctuations are compared in the following table (unit: 100 yuan per transaction unit):</p>

<p>Yesterday, banks were closed for a foreign holiday, and all Chinese merchant banks were on their regular Sunday holiday, so the market atmosphere was even more deserted than usual. The silver loan interest rate was reduced by a small fraction, calculated at three points. The morning and afternoon markets were the same. Transactions in the swap market involved over 4.7 million in morning transactions and over 200,000 in new transactions. The afternoon market was small, only over 100,000. Transactions in the small general meeting totaled over 200,000. The Qian Zhuang silver dollar collection and remittance amounted to over 33.3 million. Remittances from various routes totaled over 200,000. In the subsidiary currency market, the Jiangnan small silver dollars remained the same as the previous day in both the morning and afternoon markets, calculated at 833 yuan. The morning and afternoon markets were also the same. The morning market traded 3,000 jiao, and the afternoon market traded 6,000 jiao.

<p>— Bottom Stock Single Trend Is Seen as Thin, and Continued Tightness is Expected —</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market still had no revitalizing signs, and the turnover was also small. The guild's bids were like 24 coarse-grained white sugar at 19 yuan and 8 jiao, 89 Yellow Red at the original price, Taikoo B mark at 20 yuan and 2 jiao, but there were no transactions. Zhenji No. 1's local white sugar was bid at 18 yuan and 5 jiao, but there were few takers. On the market, only a few three hundred boxes of Shimen sliced ​​sugar were opened, with a price of 9 yuan and 3 jiao, which was a jiao better than before. Because the bottom inventory is lacking, the price is still exquisite, and very suitable for sales, so the price has risen. The market is still expected to remain tight. The Chao Gang number shop only opened a batch of Huanggang Qing, totaling over a hundred bags, with a price of 11 yuan and 5 jiao, with few more openings.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various gangs, thirty-odd numbers (over five thousand stones), both wholesale and retail, were still moving, but the situation was slightly inferior. Fortunately, the arrival of goods was slightly scarce, and no significant impact was seen, presenting a calm situation. The usual Jiangsu Tong Nan Port japonica rice, and other types of rice in this street had no ups and downs in prices. The price of Duyang Tip saw its price show signs of softening, even though there was not much fluctuation in price, due to the relatively weak route. The arrival of Bian Yin Yuan goods was sudden and abundant, resulting in oversupply, and the price was reduced by nearly a jiao. The retail sales of late rice from various gangs were mediocre, relying on wholesale sales. For example, the Beiyang Gang continued to accept 1,300 to 1,400 bags of Qing Jiao Song Si Xi Lian, so the situation was still similar, and there was not much difference in their prices.</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Fate of Poets <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Shortly after the suicide of the poet Zhu Xiang, I received news that the French "Poet King" Paul Fort was experiencing financial difficulties. This talented poet, who had published more than thirty collections of poetry, was not only ill but also poor in his late sixties, which was truly distressing.</p>
<p>"I am a tree of poetry," Paul Fort once said in his own poem. He had a unique talent for poetry. His prolific works had gained a wide readership. Perhaps it was due to the global economic crisis, or perhaps it was due to changing times, but the "Poet King" Paul Fort had fallen into such dire straits in his later years. If Paul Fort was like this, one can only imagine the situation of other poets.</p>
<p>Is this how the fate of poets should be? I can't help but ask. At the same time, I also think of the suicides of poets. Of course, we are not counting those who committed slow suicide and "homicide." Chatterton, G. de Nerval, Yssenine, Mayakovski, Kitamura Tokoku, Ikuta Shungetsu, Wang Guowei, and Zhu Xiang all died by suicide. In addition, many poets also lived in poverty for most of their lives. Why is the fate of poets so often like this?</p>
<p>Society wants people to sing their praises, but most poets have no flattering bones. Society wants people to join in their corruption, but most poets are upright and unyielding. In this way, they are bound to face their fate of "poverty."</p>
<p>Like the rabbit mourning the fox's death, I feel sorrow for my kind. I heard that the Japanese poet Horiguchi Daigaku recently published "A Selection of Paul Fort's Poetry" and plans to send the royalties to the original author. I wonder how much this international friendship will help Paul Fort economically?</p>
<p>From the poet Paul Fort, I also think of the novelist Dieko Bora Lai from the same country who traveled to China some time ago. A single book, "The Holy Virgin in the Sleeper Car," earned him an income of 2 million francs. It seems that making a fool of oneself and performing can lead to a good life!</p>
<h3 id="e228">Hope <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Benxing</p>
<p>Year after year, wandering at the ends of the earth, but where is a glimmer of hope?</p>
<p>Could it be placed in the sky, stirred up by the fierce wind,</p>
<p>rising faintly, like the smoke from evening cooking fires,</p>
<p>drifting to the land of nowhere?</p>
<p>Could it be printed on ice,</p>
<p>melted by the scorching sun,</p>
<p>slowly, like the falling flowers of late spring,</p>
<p>drifting to be buried in the vast ocean?</p>
<p>Ah! I am seeking a glimmer of hope!</p>
<p>Year after year, wandering at the ends of the earth~</p>
<h3 id="e229">Small Hands <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>I saw my friend Shan on a asphalt road lined with graves on both sides.</p>
<p>"Hey," Shan greeted me first, "don't you recognize me?"</p>
<p>How could I not recognize him? Shan still looked the same, it was just his luxurious new clothes that made me a little hesitant. We shook hands, Shan's hand was warm, oily, and plump. The cuffs of his white shirt were snow-white.</p>
<p>"Aren't you working at XX?" I looked down at my dry, wrinkled, and rough palms.</p>
<p>"What work?" he smiled, "I haven't been 'working' for a long time. Now I'm practicing holding a baby, hahaha..."</p>
<p>He asked me to go to his house to see their little animal. As we walked, he talked about the little animal, making small talk with me. I was puzzled for a long time, and finally understood, "Oh, he's talking about his child!"</p>
<p>When we arrived at Shan's house, Qi was standing there wearing all black, holding a little baby covered in velvet. I was surprised, "What wind blew Qi here? What trick are this clever woman and Shan playing again! This woman is said to be at XX..."</p>
<p>Shan smiled, ran forward, took the baby, and said, "You don't even recognize Qi!" Then he turned his smiling face to Qi and said, "He didn't recognize me on the road either!"</p>
<p>The woman laughed like silver bells, swaying her slender waist.</p>
<p>"Look at our little animal, isn't it cute?" she said.</p>
<p>Oh, I understood, they were a couple.</p>
<p>The little animal had lively black eyes. When it saw a stranger, it cried. The couple hurriedly comforted the child, ignoring me. I stood aside, thinking that we used to be on the same line, I knew you, you knew me. Now you are on the line, I am off the line, how could I dare to presume?</p>
<p>"Your little animal is really good, really good, really good, really good!"</p>
<p>After saying a string of "really good," I made an excuse and left.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Concerning the Libelous Accusations of He Jiahuai (Continued) <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuanpeng</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about our article dispute. He says, "Zhuanpeng insists that I took his articles without his permission, I truly don't know what his intentions are?" But I say, except for the "Chariot of Water" piece, which I did receive permission for beforehand, all the others were without my permission. My fault is only that I didn't argue with him after he changed the name and published it. He says that my "Prison Break" was something that neither I nor my friends were satisfied with. I can say that there isn't a single thing I write that I am satisfied with, but this work that everyone is dissatisfied with, changed its name, added and subtracted about 300 words, and then published, became his proud "masterpiece." I ask, is there any completely terrible work that, after only modifying three hundred or so words, becomes a "masterpiece?"</p>
<p>Whenever I entrusted Jiahuai to recommend an article, he would always say, "This article is not well written!" At first, I didn't dare to have malicious suspicions, but now it seems that he said it was bad first to discourage me, and then he took it to publish, which he could then justify.</p>
<p>Before Shi Heng exposed this matter, Zhao Jiabi and Shi Heng mediated, wanting to resolve this matter secretly. However, Jiahuai denied it to Zhao, saying that some of his novels only took my idea. Later, he also said that my article had been revised by him, and he had revised it a lot. When I heard this, I just smiled and dismissed it, never imagining that he would have the gall to write it down.</p>
<p>Apart from my first one or two novels, where he added and revised more, the rest were merely changes in wording. These changes in wording were only to conceal the difference in writing style between the two of us. I have also opened a list below.</p>
<p>(1) Toothache: This was my first piece of work, originally very simple. He did indeed add a lot, but it was definitely not as he said, increasing it from two thousand words to six thousand words. My original draft was about three to four thousand words. However, everyone can find this piece and take a look; it is still a terrible mess.</p>
<p>(2) A Soldier's Wife: I originally sent this article to New Moon (Xin Yue), whose editor at that time was Mr. Shao Xunmei. After reading the manuscript, he said it was usable, but New Moon shelved it for two months without publishing it. I wrote a letter to ask for it back, and he replied that it was lost. At that time, Jiahuai was doing proofreading in the editorial department of New Moon Bookstore, so I asked him to check, and he replied that he couldn't find it. But after a summer vacation, I returned to Shanghai and saw it published in Literary Monthly (Wenyi Yuekan) under his name. Afterwards, when I met Jiahuai, I was afraid that Jiahuai would blush, so I didn't mention it. The original text was six to seven thousand words, and he stretched it to more than eight thousand words.</p>
<p>(3) The Sixth Child: He said, "I sent Zhuanpeng's original manuscript to Eastern (Dongfang) with my name on it." I originally entrusted him to recommend this manuscript to Eastern, but on my original manuscript, he changed it to his name the first time he sent it. I didn't know this secret beforehand, only after it was published did I see that Jiahuai's name had been changed. He also said he changed it, but this article didn't mention the extent of the changes or how many words were added. Citing the fact that he bothered the editor as proof that my original work was not good.</p>
<p>(4) Fishermen's Joy: He said he revised it three times, but I don't know how he revised it. According to my examination, he only piled up a little description. Adding about a thousand words is probably right.</p>
<p>(5) Chariot of Water: I had agreed to this article, because Modern returned his manuscript once in a row. He seemed resentful and told me, and at the same time, he discovered the newly written "Chariot of Water" in my drawer. After reading it, he insisted on taking it and complained to me about his own difficulty in writing. I agreed to him. I still have this original manuscript, and he only added a few hundred words.</p>
<p>(6) Valley Night: Some sentences have one or two words, or some lines have one and a half sentences that he changed, but he changed very little. This is a work that I myself consider slightly satisfactory. I was very happy to ask him to recommend it to Literary Monthly, but after a long wait, the published work changed its name again.</p>
<p>(7) Prison Break: When I finished writing this article, I happily sent it to him to read. After reading it, he shook his head and said it was not good. But later, it was published in Literature (Wenxue), and he called it his own satisfactory work in his article. He said, "Although I didn't notify him when I revised it, I wrote a letter to tell him before it was published." This is a fabrication. The words he added didn't even amount to a hundred.</p>
<p>(8) Gambling Den: He said he revised about three thousand words, but according to my investigation, it was less than six hundred words.</p>
<p>The other three articles—Blind Woman, Dinner, Entertainment—were not changed by a single word. He made some deletions and revisions to my articles, which I had already stated a month ago in my letter to the editor of Modern. I don't want to take the articles he revised as my own. If I take the articles back, I will still revise them according to my own writing style, in my own original way. Of course, I can tell which parts of my own articles he has revised.</p>
<p>Recently, many people in the press have said that I have received a share of the profits. Jiahuai also concealed this point in his confession. My article was taken by him and published under his name. He used the manuscript fees, and he still asks me what my intentions are?</p>
<p>Jiahuai said in his confession that he wants to embark on a solid path of "new life," which everyone would like to hear. But I hope that before his "new life," he washes himself several times, washing away all base and sinister behavior. Otherwise, like a monkey wearing human clothes, walking on the "new life" path, it is not a very glorious thing! (The End)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding the issue of creation between He and Xu, this publication has spent enough space. We intend to end it here. We will not publish any further submissions from either party.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Sketches of Beiping <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>(4) Random Strolls</p>
<p>What people in Beiping call "liuda liuda" (溜躂溜躂) is actually what is meant by taking a walk; the Shanghai term "dang malu" (蕩馬路) is similar. But sometimes the meaning of "liuda" seems to be more than just "dang malu" and also implies "baixiang" (白相, wandering around for pleasure), which can only be expressed by someone who is experienced in "liuda."</p>
<p>Strolling westward from Dongdan Archway to Dongchanganmen is a straight and spacious avenue—Dongchangan Street—which is much wider than Rue Edward VII in Shanghai. Along the north side of the street is a stretch of lush green trees, concealing hotels of varying heights, all of which are Western-style. Before dancing was prohibited, it was a place of bustling activity. The south side of the street is the parade ground of the garrisons of various countries, which stretches continuously. The outside is enclosed by wooden fences and barbed wire, prohibiting idlers from entering. The base of the parade ground is about a foot higher than Dongchangan Street, probably because it is constantly filled with soil and raised. Along the south side of the parade ground are the thick walls of embassies and military camps. The walls are full of honeycomb-like gun holes, which, it is said, were built after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 to guard against the "rebellion" of the Chinese!</p>
<p>Strolling further west, passing through Dongchanganmen, is the front of the old imperial city. Two white stone dragon-carved ornamental columns stand on both sides, and the "Five Dragon Bridge" with five white stone carved railings lies across the open space. Beyond the bridge is the towering Tiananmen gate tower. The vermilion city walls, with five arched gates facing the Five Dragon Bridge, create a magnificent and solemn scene. However, upon closer inspection, the railings on the city tower have been eroded by wind and rain. If one were to climb the tower, it would surely be covered with thick dust and cobwebs! The vermilion-colored plaster on the city walls is also covered with a layer of dark gray, and the bricks are exposed where it has peeled off in patches. The carved railings of the Five Dragon Bridge also show a dilapidated appearance, with grass growing in the cracks of the stone slabs on the bridge surface. The two ornamental columns are protected by stone railings and are relatively the most complete, but the western one has a crack near the top!</p>
<p>Going north from the Tiananmen entrance is what is called the Forbidden City, while strolling south can take you all the way to Qianmen. But whether you go north or south, what unfolds before you is only a scene of decay. The things you see, even a broken stone slab under your feet, can tell you of its former greatness; but because you know its former greatness, you feel even more sorrow for its current decline. Indeed, everything in Beiping is in decline!</p>
<p>Strolling back along the original route, if it is at night, you will encounter several rickshaws that specialize in soliciting business around Dongdan Archway.</p>
<p>"Sir, let me take you for a liuda liuda around the east. There are good ones... Russian... Korean... newly arrived from Shanghai..."</p>
<p>And so you feel that even "liuda liuda" has declined.</p>
<h3 id="e232">On Translation (Continued) <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— An</p>
<p>Three, the aim is to benefit people. Introducing culture and translating works is like doing business. But in addition to benefiting the academic and intellectual communities, there should be no other aims. Western scholarship is also vast and boundless, but if it is of no use to us, even if you are proficient in the original text and the translation is accurate, the effort is in vain. Therefore, one should first:</p>
<p>A: Establish a position. "Brother advocates political reform." Well then, good, you've established a position. If you want to do translation work, then translate famous works on politics, so that the work and the position are not too far apart. But it is not appropriate to translate "New Cooking Methods" because of so-and-so's personal request, or to translate "Research on Artificial Silk" because of so-and-so's company's employment. Because even if the translation is accurate, it is too much of a waste of effort. The terminology is different, the methods of expression are also different, it is difficult; it is a waste of one's own time and energy, like a thoroughbred horse carrying a pagoda car up the Taihang Mountains, which makes others feel sorry for it; moreover, it is possible that in the future one might translate "Research on the Treaty of Versailles" or "International Public Law," and have it placed next to things like "New Cooking Methods" in bookstores, which would also feel quite incongruous. I have heard that many students returning from abroad casually pick up novels and translate them, which shows that they have no position.</p>
<p>B: First set a plan. If you have your own consistent position, you must have a consistent path. You won't be translating "Infantry Drill Manual" today and "The Renaissance" tomorrow. The plan can be centered on an era or centered on an idea. First translate X, then translate Y, with a definite step-by-step approach. It is best to take the modern Chinese readership as a prerequisite. Your writing style is too profound, making it difficult for people to understand; or you translate works that are irrelevant to us, such as "The History of Fashion Changes in Paris over the Past Forty Years" or "Research on London Fog," which are beautiful, but what is it to China! "What is it to the people!"</p>
<p>Generally, if the aim is established and the ability is also very high, then at this time there is the question of "how to translate." The above three items all explain "how to be qualified to translate books." The following points discuss how to translate to achieve twice the result with half the effort: 1. Do not translate English-Chinese dictionaries, or French-Chinese dictionaries, etc.—When using dictionaries when translating, it is best to use dictionaries that provide the original text's original explanation. Most of the current foreign language-Chinese dictionaries are suitable for beginners of foreign languages, but not suitable for translation. Sometimes when your train of thought is stuck, seeking inspiration in such dictionaries is like a restless hope for comfort from the opposite sex, who only makes you more restless and inflamed. What poet who writes well would embrace the "Peiwen Yunfu" or "Shiyun Hebi"?</p>
<p>What translator constantly takes out words from the dictionary to patch together and arrange? Moreover, the existing foreign language-Chinese dictionaries are mostly confused to the point of being hopeless.</p>

<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>"Oh, sympathy!" A sharp tremor pierced her heart.</p>
<p>Yina decided to write a letter to those who were good at sympathy. She took out a pen and a handkerchief from her handbag, and then exchanged this handbag for the equipment needed to write the letter.</p>
<p>Near the Cathay Theatre, she walked into a delicate coffee shop. She ordered a cup of coffee and began to write. To those who are good at sympathy:</p>
<p>"Yes, I am a weak person, but I don't want your sympathy, much less your pity. Also, if you want to be sentimental, please let go of this weak person and find another object, how about it?</p>
<p>She wanted to write a few more sentences, but she couldn't think of what to write. She opened the envelope, addressed to Xi Zhuoyun. She also wanted to write a letter to him, telling him that this was her last submission and asking him to publish it as soon as possible. But she didn't write. She didn't write anything else, only her name under the title.</p>
<p>The coffee was cold. She drank it all in one gulp and went to the nearest post office to send the letter by registered mail.</p>
<p>Leaving the post office, she walked west. She was paying attention to where the trams were running faster. She walked all the way past the Huida Hotel and stopped in front of the French barracks.</p>
<p>Seeing a beautiful No. 2 tram speeding over, she ran over and threw herself forward onto the tracks.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, by the time the letter had been mailed, Yina had already entered another world, making that letter a will. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e234">This Ambition Is Frightening <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>China, surrounded by powerful nations, is like a piece of fat meat, which everyone is drooling over. Today, Country A fantasizes about digging a hole, tomorrow Country B attempts to take a few bites. Up to now, the reason why it has been fortunate enough to barely survive is not because it has any resistance of its own, but because the ambitious people have not yet finished dividing it up. However, even if it is being swallowed piece by piece like this, I am afraid that one day it will be eaten up completely!</p>
<p>We see that Outer Mongolia has long declared independence, the Northeast is no longer ours, Inner Mongolia is just now making a fuss about demanding autonomy, and alarming news continues to come from Tibet and Xinjiang. The outbreak of all these unfortunate events is invariably instigated by ambitious people behind the scenes, who are playing tricks and conspiracies. In order to prevent fires from starting, they seem to have secretly agreed on a plan and are colluding with each other, tacitly acknowledging a certain place as a certain country's sphere of influence, and a certain place as a certain person's area of activity. In this way, each country can freely and unrestrictedly charge around in its so-called sphere of influence or area of activity, doing whatever it wants. As long as it does not hinder the interests of other countries, no one will come out to interfere. Not only that, but sometimes after they have trampled on something to their satisfaction, they will turn around and do a favor, currying favor and inciting others to commit aggression, which is hateful and detestable! The following news is a major exposure of Japanese conspiracies.</p>
<p>According to reports from Moscow, the former Turkish Prince Abdülkerim has departed from Shanghai for Xinjiang. Kerim went to Shanghai from Tokyo a few months ago and hid in a certain concession. He is a puppet of Japan and a candidate for the throne of an independent kingdom in Xinjiang. Currently, some Japanese military circles are cooperating with Turkish exiles to actively win over military and propaganda cadres in order to promote the realization of an independent kingdom in Xinjiang. According to the report, Kerim's departure from Shanghai is to personally preside over this work, as the work has already made considerable progress (TASS dispatch on the 23rd).</p>
<p>After reading this alarming news, I feel that the ambition of the Japanese is very frightening. Since they coerced our country into signing the Twenty-One Demands, they have used every means to deal with our country. The September 18th Incident saw them extend a huge palm and forcibly seize the land of our four provinces, establishing their so-called Manchuria. We thought that since they had obtained this "lifeline," and their long-cherished desire had been fulfilled, they might somewhat curb their ambitious aggression. Who knew that the enemy's greed was insatiable, and they would take an inch and demand a mile? There was first the attempt to organize a North China nation, and now there is the conspiracy to incite the former Prince to go to Xinjiang to establish an independent nation. Their premeditation is also vicious! Although it has not yet been verified whether this cable is reliable, our country should not remain indifferent at a time when the Xinjiang dispute has not been resolved. I hope that our government and people will pay close attention to this and prevent ambitious people from achieving their improper goals, which would cause great losses and disasters!</p>
<h3 id="e235">Meddling <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Friends intentionally or unintentionally ask me why I haven't been writing recently. Because I am a person who makes a living by writing, suddenly stopping writing seems surprising to them. Of course, they are too embarrassed to ask me if I haven't been eating recently, but the tone of the question seems to contain an attempt to uncover my secrets. Since I accidentally wrote a few love stories last year, friends have had a lot of talking points. Young people are naturally energetic when talking about love, especially when they enjoy uncovering other people's secrets. In fact, I am a law-abiding young man, and I can no longer be interested in love. Although I was somewhat moved by Miss Fei after meeting her, she has already gone to the South. We met unintentionally and parted just as unintentionally. However, my accusation seems to have been established because of this: a young man who writes love stories must be in love. So, I was suspected by my friends, so I thought I would never write such articles again. Having made such a decision, I wandered around every day, taking the opportunity to rest from my hard work over the past year, and then work hard to write. However, not writing can also make friends distrust me. Recently, friends who asked me the reason for not writing also added a sentence: What are you busy with? Obviously, he thought that the reason for not writing was being restrained by something, and that something was the secret they wanted to uncover. To borrow an old saying, "No coincidence, no story." A friend visited me three times and didn't find me at home. Yesterday, I met him in the cinema. I happened to be with a lady whom I had only met once and had forgotten her name (actually, everyone may have encountered this kind of embarrassing situation). He questioned me as if he had caught me red-handed. I felt very bored in that situation. At the same time, I felt very sorry for the lady whose name I didn't know, who was being ridiculed when she was confused.</p>
<p>The nature of the Chinese is to like to meddle in other people's business. They often eat their own fill and worry about other people's accounts. The young lady of the East family is unruly, the daughter-in-law of the West family is having an affair, as if he were involved, and he can give a full and satisfying account from beginning to end. Especially for this kind of scandalous affair that is considered a secret, he can add fuel to the fire and make it sensational. The person who is speaking is indeed satisfied with his desire to destroy, but those who meddle should also be prepared for when their own business is meddled in, and they probably wouldn't be happy if others did that to them, right? Furthermore, going to a movie with a girlfriend is, in my opinion, nothing surprising, even though the cinema in Shanghai is not a good place.</p>
<p>I have been meddled with from my hometown to Shanghai, making it impossible for me to ever return to my old nest, which is within sight. My fate seems to be controlled by the hands of those who meddle, so I hate meddling as much as others like to meddle.</p>
<p>However, to tell the truth, that friend didn't necessarily intend to meddle in my business. He eats the same white rice as me, and moreover, his own business is also being meddled in by others. Joking around is certainly acceptable between friends, but I don't need you to do my advertising for me! Perhaps I am going to offend my friends, but that is not my hope; I am going to write, and hereby announce that I am not restrained by anything like a secret.</p>

<h3 id="e236">A Certain Death <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>Death is common, but the death of Hu, even though it has been three long years, still weighs heavily on my mind. I cannot forget him, his shadow is always flickering before my eyes, because his death was too tragic! Because his death was too unjust! But he did not die in a domestic quarrel, nor did he die under the gun of a suspected criminal for an unprovable charge, and he did not die from economic oppression, or even suicide from unrequited love.</p>
<p>He died of illness, truly and certainly.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, his death was due to feudal forces, and his parents directly wielded the executioner's blade; however, his parents were indeed the most loving towards him - they saw him as a precious pearl in the palm of their hand. So, although they ended their son's life, they were almost driven mad by Hu's death.</p>
<p>This is a contradictory thing, and even more contradictory death!</p>
<p>If there really is such a thing as "genius" in human talent, then I would call Hu a child genius. He was the most outstanding of my childhood friends. Eleven years ago, we studied together in the same private school, reading things like the Selections of Refined Literature and Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Governance, all of which he could recite fluently. At that time, he was only twelve years old. Later, we went to high school together, and his homework was always more proficient than others. Although not every exam result showed it, his name always fell far behind ours.</p>
<p>In terms of physique, his inherent body - the frame his parents gave him - although not very strong, was not weaker than that of ordinary children. Compared to me, he was probably slightly better.</p>
<p>When we graduated from high school, he was only fifteen years old. According to physiology, it was the peak of puberty. He did grow quickly. One time he told me, "I'm getting married soon, probably before going to the provincial capital to study!" Naturally, at that time, I was also like a "mouse greeting the light," unable to see that early marriage was harmful; and in our hometown, early marriage had become common practice. As long as a family had food to eat, children as young as thirteen or fourteen, still "wet behind the ears," would get married, and the women they married were in their twenties. So, when I heard what he said, I not only did not disapprove, but also admired it a little.</p>
<p>Little did I know that this was the root of Hu's early death.</p>
<p>When we went to City C to study, we were in different schools. Because we were far apart, and because we were both still studying hard, we did not see each other often. Only occasionally did I hear some news about him from other moving friends - that he was often sick, and it was said that he had contracted tuberculosis. So, I worried about him, and I considered his life journey. When I returned home for vacation, I gave him some advice - not to be harmed by his wife, and that "avoiding sex" was the only panacea for curing his illness, but I don't know if he ever took my advice.</p>
<p>In 1928, we came to Shanghai together, with the aim of taking the entrance exam for the X Public School, which has now been discontinued. His wife also came with him. He himself was willing, and his parents did not object. The friends' persuasion, of course, was like the "wind in the ear," having no effect at all. Unfortunately, he did not pass the exam, suffering a setback, and he continued to spend every day with his wife. At this time, in addition to being infected by the feudal poison of his hometown, he was also tempted by the "romance" of the city, and his body could not support it. So, he returned to his hometown.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1929, he wrote to me with two pieces of news - one was that his original wife had passed away due to childbirth complications, and the other was that he had married a "fairly suitable" second wife. That was terrible, and I could only feel more worried for him, but I had nothing to say, because saying it would be ineffective. His parents were both so ignorant.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1931, I returned to my hometown and specially went to visit him. He was already a corpse before the god of death. His stomach was swollen like a tadpole's belly, his face was pale, and when I talked to him, he only burst into sobs. His parents sat beside him, recounting the past few years in detail, with tears and snot streaming down their faces.</p>
<p>A week later, the news of his death reached my ears.</p>
<p>Hu died like this. It was a tragic death! A truly unjust death! But in our hometown, and even in the vast and closed interior, many young people suffer from the feudal poison, recklessly marry early, and die such tragic and unjust deaths!</p>
<h3 id="e237">Healthy Queen <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Che Tian</p>
<p>(Beiping News: The queen election scene involved over two hundred female students competing, parading in formation. Initially, over thirty were selected, followed by a second round of voting resulting in five finalists. Finally, after careful deliberation and evaluation by the judges, the "Healthy Queen" crown was awarded to "Wu XX", a second-year medical student. The entire venue erupted in cheers, and the Department of Physical Education presented her with flowers as a reward...)</p>
<p>Originally, it seems this year has taken a bit of a "turn backward," like a retro trend causing a "queen craze."</p>
<p>In the past, there were movie queens, school queens, courtesan queens, and... various other queens of unclear nature. In this environment where "where there's testing, there's cheating," queen elections inevitably involve corruption. Perhaps there are exceptions, but please forgive my exaggeration.</p>
<p>In short, whether or not there's corruption is a separate issue. Those who can ascend to the queen's throne must possess unique qualities. At the very least, they must meet one of the following two criteria:</p>
<p>(1) A lithe figure and a beautiful face.</p>
<p>(2) Eloquent speech and frivolous demeanor.</p>
<p>Indeed, we are accustomed to seeing such figures, like a monkey show. To summarize, those elected are merely embracing "show-offism." As for the electors, even if they don't dare to have "ulterior motives," they at least have "private agendas"! Ask yourself, would an old woman have the qualifications to be elected queen?</p>
<p>Therefore, when newspapers reveal their names and publish commercialized, leisurely writing about them, I simply consider them as yet another expensive, distinctive, and valuable vase in society!</p>
<p>Now, Miss "Wu XX" has been elected queen. Because she is the "Healthy Queen," I think she is ultimately more insightful and meaningful than other queens. At the very least, Miss Wu carries the mission of being a "healthy role model," attracting Chinese women to pursue health, which is much better than "university queens" who only engage in romance with male students and create chaos, or romantic "movie queens" who merely cut ribbons at opening ceremonies.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope this is an honest election, without any attached purposes! Then, the "Healthy Queen" would truly be worthy of praise!</p>
<p>I don't know what others think, but I always find the word "queen" too vulgar and a bit too retro. Perhaps it's because "things reach an extreme only to revert," and everyone wants to taste the flavors of the past. Unable to taste the actual flavors, they settle for hanging an ancient sign, considering it a small indulgence. It's like being born in this era and hearing elders say how good ancient times were. Although we haven't witnessed it, we secretly hope to live in such a peaceful century, enjoying a couple of years of peace. However, we can only indulge in dreams, like hanging an "ancient queen sign." Perhaps it's possible, but who can predict such things? After rambling on, I wonder if those who aspire to be "queen" share the same sentiment. This is a very interesting question worth studying!</p>

<p>— Hutu</p>
<p>The clear sky is swept by gusts of slightly chilly wind, and golden sunlight shines over the land. The branches of the roadside trees have already sprouted pale green buds, and the willow branches sway with graceful姿态 in the gentle breeze. From the depths of my mind, I deeply realize: spring has arrived in the world! Thus, with a heart full of fervent emotions, sincerely and earnestly, I went to the virgin-like, serene Zhaofeng Park to seek the traces of the god of spring.</p>
<p>Indeed, spring is lovely. But especially in this neatly trimmed, clean park, the green grass, lush shade of trees, clear small pond, and layered rockeries... everything feels worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Walking to the fishpond, I saw a group of children sitting on a green lawn, full of life, so innocent and so lovely. Seeing the small flags in their hands, I realized that they were led out to play by their teachers from school. In the embrace of nature, they ate food and chatted and played, like a herd of released horses or a flock of docile lambs, playing together under the leadership of their teachers. How happy!</p>
<p>I recalled my childhood days, when I was just as happy and carefree as they were! However, years have passed, and the sweet dreams of the golden age will never return. At this moment, a feeling of longing is truly indescribable! I wished I could join their ranks, laugh and play with them. Finally, I raised my voice and shouted: "Children! Can I join your ranks? Children! Please let me join your ranks!" But none of them paid attention to me. Several times I shouted like this, but none of them paid attention to me. After eating well, they sat for a while, got up from the grass, and went outside in a long line.</p>
<p>Ah! A discarded heart, having lost its innocence, stood outside the ranks of children, pacing back and forth, its heart filled with sadness and pain. Tears streamed down from my eyes, wetting my clothes, but I didn't notice. I only deeply felt: "Now I can only stand outside the ranks of children!"</p>
<h3 id="e240">The Problem of Marriage Between Close Relatives <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Lüsha</p>
<p>Marriage between close relatives has adverse effects on offspring. This is what most scholars have been advocating recently, such as deafness, muteness, deformities, idiocy, pigmentary retinitis, and weak constitutions, which are often seen in the descendants of those who marry within close bloodlines. Scholars have already made many reports. But I think they have absolutely no scientific basis. Why? If marriage between close relatives has such a detrimental effect on offspring, then the people of ancient times, who always had the habit of marrying within close relationships, wouldn't their descendants be very weak? But the facts tell us that this is not the case. In ancient times, such as in Egypt and Persia, the nobility married within close relatives. For example, Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt, was one of the most beautiful women in the world, born from a marriage between siblings. Not only did she have a strong physique, but she also had a clear and intelligent mind, capable of freely using the dialects of eighteen countries and being proficient in Greek literature and philosophy. Even the scholars of that time felt that she was behind them. Furthermore, marriage between close relatives is still prevalent in modern Japan, especially among the imperial family. Are they all mentally disabled, idiotic, or deformed?</p>
<p>But then again, why has marriage between close relatives always been criticized by scholars? That's all based on hearsay. Originally, the characteristics of our bodies and minds, as well as the predisposing factors and constitutions to diseases, can be inherited by offspring. In those who marry from the same bloodline, the peculiarities existing between their bloodlines, whether good or bad, will have a more intense influence on their descendants. Therefore, if the bloodline is strong, marriage between close relatives is beneficial to offspring. Conversely, if the bloodline still has hereditary diseases or is weak, then marriage between bloodlines is harmful to offspring. However, to go a step further: it is rare to find a bloodline with both healthy body and mind. Therefore, when bloodlines marry each other for generations, their descendants will inevitably suffer from the influence of heredity. Except for bloodlines that are physically strong and have absolutely no hereditary constitutions, it is still better to avoid marriage between close relatives. In summary, deafness, muteness, idiocy, and weakness are definitely not the causes of marriage between close relatives. From the principle of heredity, it is the influence of special hereditary defects in the bloodline being doubled and passed on to descendants. We absolutely cannot believe those theories that marriage between close relatives directly deteriorates the blood and causes various diseases.</p>
<p>In conclusion, marriage between close relatives is not harmful if there are no aforementioned illnesses. However, marrying within bloodlines for generations is detrimental to offspring.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Minor Illness <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Wenli</p>
<p>Busy people like to have minor illnesses to rest their tired bodies. I, an unbusy person, am now having a minor illness, which is as annoying as a child born into a large family. I've been sick for days, unable to read or write at home, and staring at the white wall all day long. In my discomfort, I've had many beautiful daydreams. The central idea of the stories is: if one day I could have food to eat without having to write, any occupation would be fine. It's as if I'm inside a movie screen, sometimes a schoolteacher lecturing students on an introduction to literature, sometimes a clerk in a newspaper office copying documents, sometimes an accountant in a store recording accounts and writing letters... It's as if I've become someone who isn't unemployed, how proud! But at the same time, I think about what would happen if a minor illness turned into a major one. Thinking of this, the scene of visiting a friend at the Red Cross hospital the other day immediately began to play in my mind like a movie screen, scene by scene. The third-class room with more than a dozen beds filled with moaning patients, the camera: from far to near, arriving at my friend's bed. Close-up: my friend's withered, pale, bloodless face, his eyes barely open, his dry lips moving as he speaks, but with little strength. Subtitle: "I've been sick for a month or two, spent a lot of money, but the illness hasn't improved at all! Now I have no money, I owe the hospital, what am I going to do?" I only spoke a few words to him when I saw the nurse coming. She forbade the patient to talk. Close-up: the nurse's angry face, glaring at the patient and scolding. Subtitle: "You're not allowed to talk, the doctor ordered it, you never listen! I won't let anyone visit you anymore!" As she said this, she glanced at me, explaining that he wasn't allowed to talk. Subtitle: "Those of you who come to visit should stop him from talking." As she said this, she twisted her waist and walked away. I thought to myself: why be so arrogant to a patient? Wouldn't it be better to be kinder? Recalling, near shot: in a first-class ward, I was also visiting a sick friend. A nurse came in, smiling kindly and speaking to the patient. Subtitle: "Mr. X, you have to be obedient, the doctor told you not to talk too much. Why did you talk so much as soon as your friend came? Don't do it again, ah, ah, listen to me." The patient felt happy and promised her that he wouldn't talk too much anymore, and I admired her dedication to her duties. Back to the third-class room, near shot: I saw my sick friend, having been scolded by the nurse, looked at me. Saying "Patients who owe money are often subjected to such treatment, alas!" One (character) Close-up: On my friend's face, tears welled up and fell from his eyes... Thinking of that ward, I shuddered. My heart was praying: please don't let me get a serious illness.</p>
<p>A serious illness for a poor person is like being half dead, I'm afraid.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Eugenics <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Qisu</p>
<p>"Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, thieves raise sons who dig holes in walls." This is a common saying: it means that the emperor's son must be the crown prince, the big boss's son can't but be a "young master," and those born to poor people must be "lowly." However, the facts tell us that Jie and Zhou both served as the emperor's sons: The father of Emperor Xuantong was also a direct descendant of the Qing Dynasty: Moreover, there are also many who have once caused a stir who have been to Zhengjia Muqiao to ask a real young master. On the contrary, the backgrounds of today's so-called "tycoons" who ride in cars and eat gourmet food cannot necessarily be celebrated in writing. Therefore, this theory of the common saying is rarely heard from the mouths of ordinary clever people.</p>
<p>Instead, one often hears talk of how the breed of dogs cannot be mixed, as it will only turn bad: also, the breed of pigeons is also very particular. And the sons of the strong will ultimately be healthier. This originally relates to the innate and is, of course, an ironclad theory. However, some people once argued that the reason why a certain lady was able to make a great splash in the national games with her sprint was because her ancestors, for business reasons, had to run from Guannei to Guanwai several times a year on foot, which trained her strong elements and passed them on to her, which is somewhat puzzling. Because we believe that "environment" is the biggest reason for a person's failure and success. For example, if a certain lady had been locked up in a tower by her parents since she was a child, becoming a complete virgin, would she have the possibility of becoming famous for sprinting? Or, if a certain lady had been born into a poor family and spent her days washing rice, washing vegetables, and carrying children, without the good fortune to study at school and never understanding how to start a sprint, would she have stood out at the games? The various relationships in society, the so-called environment, determine everything, and no one can ride a auspicious cloud, leaving the ground.</p>
<p>Some people also believe that, in addition to a strong physique, outstanding spirit, noble personality, and solemn morality also have hereditary properties. Therefore, they proposed finding ways to allow noble people to leave more descendants, and to pay attention to the child-rearing of all base, vulgar, and mediocre people, so that future society would be full of good seeds and no evil would occur.</p>
<p>But this is also an equally untenable theory. The relations of production in society, that is, economic conditions, determine everything. Reason and will cannot control people in the slightest. A famous scientist, for the sake of his stomach, would manufacture lethal weapons, and a virtuous preacher, in order to be comfortable, could deceive goats for cunning foxes. The iron circle of economics dominates those within the circle. There will be no exceptions, and there will be no coincidences.</p>
<p>Anyone who is truly worried about the "world" and wants to remedy it, then they only have to pick up a broom and sweep the environment. There is no need to ride an auspicious cloud, fly in the air, or learn the wonderful skills of the Monkey King.</p>

<p>"When you ask to kiss a woman, she has been waiting for you for a long time." Probably like that, I remember someone said.</p>
<p>To seize a woman's heart seems so easy; However, no—</p>
<p>"When you bring flowers to the home of the one you love, she is already nestled in the arms of another man."</p>
<p>Mentioning women, I want to destroy the world: although I am still a man who needs women.</p>
<p>Many women have left me. I didn't ask to kiss them, I don't know if they had waited for me for a long time; I didn't bring flowers to their homes: but they were already in the arms of other men.</p>
<p>I know too few women: at the same time, I know too many women.</p>
<p>Hearing young people talking about women—I am also young—I want to speak, but I am silent. I played so many love tricks, I woke up like from a dream: I should love my wife—that only woman snuggling in my arms—but— Woman—a woman I thought was a little girl, when I loved her like I love my daughter, she learned to be like a mother, she wrote me a letter with only a few words—"She loves me—"</p>
<p>"What to do? She is a woman!" I thought about it and finally accepted it.</p>
<p>The love of a little girl is pure. Her loving me is not necessarily the same as other women loving me, I need a daughter who loves her father, and I finally accepted it.</p>
<p>The father-daughter love began.</p>
<p>— Summer of 1933.</p>
<p>On the large lawn of the French Park, two were telling the stories of princes and princesses. On Avenue Joffre, two figures strolled aimlessly. Inside the movie theater, four eyes watched the changes on the screen.</p>
<p>She loves me, I love her: a daughter and a father.</p>
<p>The news of the daughter's marriage spread, she cried in my arms like a mother, her eyes were swollen from crying, and she shouted about suicide.</p>
<p>"Daughter, you should have a young man to accompany you, Daddy has a mother." I patted her shoulder and widened my eyes to tell her what that meant.</p>
<p>She gave me a grateful hot kiss—I didn't wait for her for a long time, and she floated away like a planet.</p>
<p>Losing a daughter, the father did not have the sadness of losing a mother—a daughter should have a young man to accompany her.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Youth Needs "Understanding" <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Jianshe</p>
<p>Spiritual decadence has become a common ailment among young people, popularly dominating everyone's thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, I think this is a problem worth discussing, because it concerns us so closely.</p>
<p>Why is our spirit decadent? Some people think it's due to physical weakness and congenital heredity, so they elaborate: the vigor or decadence of the spirit is due to the strength or weakness of the body, such as the physical strength of the body. A strong body has great physical strength, and a weak body has little physical strength. The spirit is also the same, a strong body has a vigorous spirit, and a weak body has a decadent spirit. Then, they further explain the causes of physical weakness: first, due to illness, and second, due to congenital heredity. So the conclusion is that if you want the spirit to not be decadent, you must first strengthen the body.</p>
<p>On this, I disagree. Of course, the strength or weakness of the body can have a considerable influence on the spirit. But if we carefully observe the phenomenon of youth decadence, I feel that "understanding" is the most important factor in it. The blindness, mistakes, and many unfortunate things arising from blindness and mistakes are probably due to the lack of thorough understanding. The primitive people's worship of nature, the medieval people's bowing down to idols, ... are all due to not understanding the truth of these things. We know that so-called understanding is to analyze and observe something with extensive knowledge, far-sighted vision, and meticulous thinking. The clearer the analysis, the deeper the observation, the more thorough the work of understanding. With understanding as a tool, we can uncover the shrouds of all things and all phenomena: we can get close to the truth of the event.</p>
<p>We analyze the phenomenon of youth spiritual decadence and feel that it is not due to physical weakness, nor is it congenital heredity: but because the three problems of "love," "occupation," and "thought" cannot be solved. Among these three, the thought problem is the most important. As long as one of these three problems is violated, a young person can be decadent, and a living man can become a desolate and depressed person out of thin air. To avoid this decadent fate, one must find the fundamental driving force of this current society. The current society is undoubtedly a society full of contradictions and darkness. In this society, money has become the supreme ruler of mankind. This ruler derives many systems, inspections, military preparations, laws, etc., which suppress us, so that our young men and women, even with enthusiasm, cannot find a lover; even with a lover, they cannot be together; they make us sell ourselves cheaply, but we are often subjected to the doom of unemployment. As a result, we feel that this world is full of darkness, and we seem to have lost our guides, constantly hesitating and shaking.</p>
<p>In such a world, if we do not have a far-sighted vision and understand that the current situation, although full of contradictions and darkness, is only the inevitable phenomenon of the development of an old social system to its highest degree, to the eve of its collapse. Then we can easily be threatened and controlled by this dark side, and as a result, we will become gray, decadent, and defeated. So in the meantime, it's just a question of understanding or not understanding, and nothing else.</p>
<p>If we can truly understand the current society, then we can know that the attacks on love and the uncompensated exploitation of intelligence and physical strength are due to the unreasonable and bad social system. If we further know from historical investigation that this society is not fixed but evolving, and that a social system must collapse when it develops to a certain stage, then we can not only know the reasons for our pain, disappointment, and defeat, but also decide our own thoughts, so that in the face of this era's turbulent current, we know which side we should lean towards, and not make ourselves a straggler without a way out or a future.</p>
<p>How can we achieve these? It's all because of our understanding of reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that the strength or weakness of the body is not what determines our fate of decadence or non-decadence: on the contrary, understanding or not understanding is the fundamental reason for determining it. Therefore, I feel that if we want to wipe out the problem of our youth decadence, we only need to work harder on understanding.</p>

<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>(Introduction)</p>
<p>My trip to Siam was in the winter of 1929. Shanghai had already experienced snowfall. Shivering from the cold, I boarded the Taikoo Company's Nan Hua ship. As the ship crossed the Taiwan Strait, the weather gradually warmed up. By the third day when we landed in Shantou, the passengers had already shed their winter clothes and donned light autumn attire. I had never been to the South before and was amazed at how the climate could be so different in just three days. At the time, I felt like a country bumpkin who had never seen the world, full of surprise and admiration upon entering a bustling metropolis!</p>
<p>Coincidentally, there was a Siam-bound ship departing that day. I only stayed in Shantou for a few hours before embarking on another long sea voyage. The journey from Shantou to Siam usually takes a week, but it could take ten days if the seas were rough. I was on one of the faster ships on the Shantou-Siam route, so I only spent six days on board. For the first day or two, I didn't feel much, but after seeing the Annam Mountains, the weather became hotter every moment. First, I couldn't wear my coat, then I took off my vest and trousers. By the last day or two, even I, who was usually sensitive to the cold, had to follow others in dousing myself with cold water. This was a very ordinary thing for those who grew up in the tropics, but for me, it was a miracle!</p>
<p>Now, it's another severe winter with continuous wind and snow. I'm wrapped in bulky winter clothes, with the doors and windows tightly closed, yet I still don't feel warm. So, Siam, where it's summer all year round, evokes my memories again, and that's the motivation for writing this piece. The following observations are based on our experiences during our two-year stay in Siam. I think it might provide a useful reference for readers who are concerned about the current situation of the Chinese community in Siam, and also leave a lasting impression for myself.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Used a Replacement Plan So Garbo Had No Choice But to Return to America (Part 1) <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Dao</p>
<p>It's probably been over a year since Garbo returned to Hollywood. The reason for her return to America is still a matter of debate. Recently, an article was published in the American "Screen Play" magazine, describing the reason why this Swedish star suddenly returned to the United States. I found it interesting and because it revealed something that hadn't been discussed before, I excerpted some of it for the readers.</p>
<p>Among Greta Garbo's closest friends, they all knew that when she left Hollywood last time and returned to her native Sweden, she had intended to retire. She had even bought a large villa, intending to spend her remaining years in her hometown. Although America was the place where she became famous and rich, in her passionate soul, she loathed America the most and had no intention of returning to Hollywood. In the Swedish countryside villa, she could find quiet comfort and escape the scrutiny of all the strange eyes. At that time, her intention to retire was very firm. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer company, of course, did not fully understand this. They knew that she had no intention of returning to the screen, so they sent out scouts to find her replacement. As a result, they found a Russian dancer. She had no experience on screen, but she had a foreign exotic and seductive personality, with the potential to develop and replace Garbo. Therefore, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, of course, did not hesitate to sign a contract with her and secretly brought her back to the United States.</p>
<p>Who is this Russian singer? Her name is Kathryn Seava.</p>
<p>She has yellow hair and blue eyes. She has all the exotic charm and radiance that Russian women possess. Her face resembles Garbo's. After Garbo returned to Sweden, rumors of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer seeking a replacement for Garbo were rampant. Ambitious women, hearing that the title of movie queen was still vacant, developed a desire to compete, as long as there was some resemblance in their features. But among these contenders, no one resembled Garbo as closely as Kathryn Seava. Her square face, with slightly exposed cheekbones, and her eyes, nose, and mouth, all resembled the Swedish Garbo. Someone saw her, and the way she walked was so similar that some people mistook her for Garbo herself.</p>
<p>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had big plans for this Ms. Seava. They decided that if Greta Garbo did not return to America, they would promote Ms. Seava and make her a star overnight, just like Samuel Goldwyn promoted another new Russian star, Anna Sten, in a surprising and amazing way. They did not want to waste her on small roles and let her slowly rise to stardom step by step. They deliberately concealed her, keeping it a secret from the outside world, and then when the time was right, they would promote her and give her a big boost. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e247">Review of "Fashions of 1934" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Fashions of 1934—Nanjing—</p>
<p>Following "42nd Street," "Gold Diggers of 1933," and "Roman Scandals," a series of musicals have emerged one after another in a dazzling array. Here comes another one, "Fashions of 1934," which is obviously another typical American musical.</p>
<p>We can almost certainly say that the expressive methods of American film art have indeed reached their peak. It can be said that in some American films, we can see the highest form of capitalist cinema. In musicals, "Gold Diggers of 1933" is like that, "Roman Scandals" is like that, and now "Fashions of 1934" is also like that. It is the most highly formalistic work.</p>
<p>After watching this film, we might as well close our eyes and think quietly: how desperately are American filmmakers spending money? When we see the feather fan dance, the emptiness of beauty inlaid with gold is certainly not enough to make us envious or intoxicated, but the waste of capitalism is something we can't imagine. Of course, we don't need that kind of decadent luxury in our films, but we must recognize that it is a characteristic of capitalist cinema.</p>
<p>Similarly, a bright and joyful tone is a new feature of American films, and these are also fully and unreservedly displayed in "Fashions of 1934." From this point of view, we can see the director's clever and lively technique even more. The whole thing is a bright rhythm. Every joke is natural and develops without pretense. There is hardly a scene that can give you a chance to feel bored. Naturally, this will feel very comfortable for tired city dwellers. Precisely because of this, the director can give you what you want, and so the director has indeed succeeded in that aspect.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please be happy to your heart's content. At least while watching this film, you can forget the painful reality. When you leave the theater and return to the unpleasant reality, you may as well cry to your heart's content. However, drinking to drown your sorrows is a good way to relieve boredom. Now you might as well use the appreciation of musical films to replace the stimulation of alcohol. This is the most reasonable reason why bright musicals are so popular. Of course, this is the social basis for making films similar to "Fashions of 1934."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, ordinary musicals do not pay attention to the substance of the content. "Fashions of 1934" is no exception. However, the playwright reflects a little bit of reality. When Nash (played by William Powell) fails in his speculation, we cannot help but think of the fact that the foundation of the old society is shaking has become a widespread phenomenon. However, in this situation, the people who suffer the most are ultimately the people in the lower class. The so-called exploiters of the upper class are not willing to give up and will eventually come up with another new speculative method to maintain their own position. Even cheating and trickery are used without hesitation. Originally, in this false and treacherous society, everything is self-deception. Especially in this panic, as long as you have the ability to deceive, you might as well show it off as much as possible. Deception, theft, fraud, do anything. However, as the saying goes, "there is always someone stronger than you." While you are deceiving others, you will also be deceived by others. Regarding this point, the playwright writes that Nash's mistress took two thousand dollars from him, but it was stolen by Snap (played by Frank McHugh). Snap was complacent, but unexpectedly it fell into Nash's hands without him knowing. In addition, he also vividly describes the psychology of businessmen. Doria and others denounced Nash for counterfeiting fashion, but Nash asked them to fund his trip to Paris to plagiarize new fashion styles. At the time, Doria and others strongly refused, but soon each of them signed a contract with him privately. This proves how selfish and contradictory realistic businessmen are. Secondly, in the White Russian Duchess or the rich man Bullock, the ugliness of noble people is also fully exposed.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the playwright uses a lively and satirical style, which is extremely vivid, humorous, and scolding, which can be said to be excellent. And the director understands the script in this way, and with the help of extremely bright directing techniques, "Fashions of 1934" has achieved great success. As for the liveliness of the camera, it is even more superfluous.</p>
<p>Of course, it is very appropriate to have William Powell play the con man Nash. At the same time, Frank McHugh, who collaborated with him in "One Way Passage," still uses that kind of sneer here, but it is not as well-coordinated with the plot as in "One Way Passage." As for the female roles, there is not much to praise. The one who plays the White Russian Duchess is still acceptable, but has no special strengths. The others are just passable.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Review of "The Bell Rings" <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fu</p>
<p>—Jin Cheng Film—</p>
<p>Revolution, revolution, these two words have indeed been shouted very loudly and sound very nice in recent years. Isn't that so? Take the revolution of the sixteenth year of the Republic as an example. Many people died heroically in the torrent of blood, while at the same time, many people prospered and were promoted by sucking the bright red blood.</p>
<p>What is even more terrible is those people who are used to putting up a sheep's head and selling dog meat, carrying the banner of revolution and implementing the reality of false revolution. They even sing loudly about propriety, justice, integrity, and shame, but in reality, they use masks to cover up their ugliness. Alas! Revolution, revolution, "how many sins are committed in your name."</p>
<p>"The Bell Rings," judging from the words, I think there must be many great stories. However, reality is often not as beautiful as imagination. After watching this film, we can't help but feel greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>Naturally, what we must examine is the development of the story. We need revolution, this is an ironclad fact. Especially the result of the warlord melee pointed out in the film, the vast majority of people are suffering. Therefore, at this time, only the power of revolution can destroy everything old and allow the new society to grow in a new economic structure. But how does the playwright explain this era? He said: "Brave young men should serve the country with their lives" and not talk about love. Just ring the alarm bells a few times, let the young masters be plainclothes police, and cooperate from the inside and outside to respond to the National Revolution. It is possible to "successfully revolutionize" at once. (This refers to the revolution of the sixteenth year of the Republic) And what happens after success? The playwright tells us that machines are produced and a large number of workers have work to do. How distorted is this reality! However, the author explained that it was a group of young students' tricks. I think this is a faithful confession.</p>
<p>Let's leave this point aside and see how the playwright promotes his feudal ideas. He advocates emulating Liu, Guan, and Zhang's brotherhood. There are actually three young people bowing to three Bodhisattvas, and the result is "brothers of different surnames are closer than blood."</p>
<p>Speaking of Wen Yimin's directing skills, then we can say that the first half is not without merit, but it doesn't work later. Let's see, he has spent a lot of effort on the composition of each picture, and even the montage within the picture. Compared with previous works, there is also progress. However, the editing of the picture is not very reasonable. For example, when the story begins, the relationship between Zhenzhen's father and son and Qianghua Middle School is not well introduced. It is not until the end of the film that people understand their relationship. However, there are many places that are very concise before and after this. Later, there are more and more weaknesses, such as Zhenzhen buying medicine at the pharmacy and suddenly writing about a rich lady buying perfume. There is no close connection beforehand, and it is not until Zhenzhen picks up a dollar that people understand his intention. Also, after Zhenzhen met Li Cangsheng, he used a large subtitle to replace a process. In fact, the explanation of this process is not difficult. Why use subtitles to replace the picture?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we can see the director's intelligence in some places (of course, there are many small flaws), but when we recognize that a director should be responsible for the entire film, we hope that he will not be too casual in the selection of scripts, and must be careful and prudent.</p>
<p>Now, regarding acting skills, we believe that Fan Xuepeng has many good performances when playing a little girl. Her playful and lively demeanor is indeed commendable. After marrying Li Cangsheng, she is completely acting in a twisted and unnatural way, without any sense of reality. Needless to say, the director should also be responsible for this. Yao Yi is very young and acts very calmly. As for the same white hat after four years, the director was again careless. Li Yun, who plays Li Cangsheng, is also passable.</p>
<p>Finally, what must be said is that photography and scenery are all symbols of Qianghua's efforts to make progress. But for some scenes, I don't think it is necessary to exaggerate too much. Moreover, the windows and doors inevitably show traces. In short, among the products of small companies, the expressive skills of "The Bell Rings" are still commendable. From this, it can be seen that the skills of Chinese films are indeed improving, which is a very gratifying fact.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Movie Actors Perform Stage Plays <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>It is not uncommon for movie actors to go on stage. Zhou Boxun's appearance in "High Society" was not long ago. Now that spring has come, it is again the season for performing plays. Many movie actors will be active on the stage. It is said that the stage play performance hosted by the Chinese Women's Cultural Society will have many movie actors participating in the performance, which will naturally be a big sensation again.</p>
<h3 id="e250">"Woman" Nears Completion <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The screenplay and direction of "Woman" by Shi Dongshan, the female lead roles of Liming Hui and Hu Ping, and the male lead roles of Wang Yin and Wang Naidong have all achieved excellent results. The beauty of the pictures and the magnificence of the scenery are also rare in Chinese films. Zhou Kefang and Pei Lin have had great success in this film, and the director's attention to small movements in some scenes is also very interesting. It has now been filmed to eight-tenths, and it can be completely filmed in the shortest time.</p>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>When Jonna heard Lee Qu's words, she almost cried. She said that when her father died, Mrs. Connery had personally promised to let her stay there. Lee Qu said: "That's no use either. The land is hers. You don't have a contract or agreement. If she wants to let you live, she will let you live: if she doesn't want to let you live, you will have to leave, you can't do what you want. Also, the money I lent you before, I'm afraid I can't rely on it now. In order to protect my own interests, I have to ask you for collateral. Didn't I tell you before that I didn't dare to go against Mrs. Connery?" After he finished speaking, he went to entertain other customers. Jonna had no choice but to come out with her head down. As Jonna left, Lee Qu looked at her over the top of his glasses and said, "I think you should go see Mr. Will." Jonna said, "Mr. Will is out." Lee Qu shrugged his shoulders and said, "That's right... he went to Charleston... to get married!"</p>
<p>In Charleston, marriage... Will was a little doubtful, but Virginia's intentions were too obvious. Today's banquet, tomorrow's</p>
<p>dance, money flowed like water on him, but he didn't seem to have much impression. Sometimes Virginia deliberately showed some affection, which made him uncomfortable and he had to deal with her perfunctorily. He kissed her, but felt nothing. One night, after the masquerade ball was over, Will held Virginia in his arms. She whispered to Will: "You look like you're not very well-behaved in that devil's costume." Will hugged her tightly and said, "I myself feel a little unruly." So they kissed and were intoxicated. In both of their hearts, it seemed like they had already tacitly agreed.</p>
<p>However, these were all temporary temptations and impulses. So the next day, Will felt awake, and he felt a little upset when he thought of what happened last night. He went to find Virginia and apologized to her very sincerely. He said: "I can't deceive you anymore. To tell you the truth, I really can't do this to the end. I also can't ask you to find a way to borrow money for us... I can't... I really like you... very much... but I love someone else... I can't marry you..." What he said was very sincere and should have moved a kind-hearted woman, but Virginia, although her smile remained the same, her eyes were already filled with dangerous dark clouds. She said: "Who mentioned marrying or not marrying you? That's probably still your personal delusion." Will called out "Virginia" and wanted to say something, but Virginia snorted and said, "You can go to the devil, you and your tenant's daughter, and those few acres of barren land!"</p>
<p>That day, Jonna ran back from the grocery store and went to seek an audience with Mrs. Connery. Mrs. Connery didn't want to see her, so she asked Gilatine to tell her that she wouldn't see her. Old Robert was also there, and his strange eyes stared at her without blinking, saying: "Oh, you're leaving?" Jonna said, "This is very difficult." She pleaded to Gilatine again: "Miss Gilatine, please go and tell Mrs. Connery. I have two younger brothers to take care of. Please let me see her and explain to her. If she asks me to leave before the tobacco is harvested, the owner of the new goods store will sell all my belongings..." (To be continued)</p>
