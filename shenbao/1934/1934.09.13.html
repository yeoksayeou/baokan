<p>李維諾夫不滿請書措辭</p>
<p>俄入國聯起波折</p>
<p>請書修正後由法轉交</p>
<p>俄外長接悉自稱被欺</p>
<p>現由國聯特委會研究</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　蘇俄加入國聯事現生波折、列强所擬之修正請書不能使俄外長李維諾夫滿意、俄外長刻在塞佛意境内、聞對此修正請書極爲忿怒、自稱受人愚弄、此事現由特别委員研究、但不易就緒、按昨日國聯行政起草委員會議定致俄電文之新稿、將原擬請書中「俄國願遵守國聯盟約履行國聯義務」一節删除、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯多數會員國今夜通過邀俄入會之請書草稿、該項請書巳由法國代表團轉交蘇俄政府、並聞蘇俄外長李維諾夫現在隣近日内瓦之法國境内、蘇俄另一專使則巳抵日内瓦矣、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法報載稱、日内瓦方面對於蘇俄入盟之談判未能如法國政府期望之順利、蓋以若干小國雖贊成蘇俄入盟之原則、但實際上仍在作梗也、若士報紙以爲各小國之作梗係受德國對東歐公約表示態度之影響、小巴黎報發表意見稱、欲解决邀請蘇俄加入國聯之問題、至少尙須二日也、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　蘇俄入盟原則業巳决定、所餘者惟手續問題、邀請蘇俄入盟之請柬如何措詞、現正由日内瓦各代表團互相商酌、而同時日内瓦與莫斯科之間、亦爲此問題正在接洽、請柬草案、業巳電達莫斯科、蘇俄當局對請柬措詞、有何異議、以及如何答復請柬、均將於事前通知日内瓦、以故在此數日以内、行政院與蘇俄當局所談判者、專在蘇俄登塲時如何布置塲面、此種手續之籌備、事勢上亦不可少、第就問題之本身而論、其性質屬於次要、最關重者乃一國加入國聯之時、必須大會委員三分二大多數之同意、現在簽字贊成蘇俄入盟者、業巳達到此數、故重要關頭可謂巳通過矣、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英工黨競選宣言</p>

<p>（倫敦）　英國工黨現正準備明年競選、其黨綱兼及内政外交、據該黨執行委員會正式宣言、遠東局勢實爲該黨競選中所標榜之題目、該黨宣言稱、「英工黨認亞洲問題爲世界和平之樞紐、現政府對此忽略其莊嚴之條約義務、致使局勢每况愈下、卒至釀成大戰之危機、工黨今願根據國聯大會報告中所解釋之九國公約及巴黎公約之立塲、與現政府一决是非、工黨政府願與美俄密切合作、以一致之行動、對付遠東方面之侵略者及破壞條約者、如有再起戰端者、工黨根據非戰公約之精神、以全世界之行動對付之、工黨必竭其全力遏制帝國主義侵略者希圖併呑中國、或希冀破壞中國之領土完整及政治獨立」云云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>波羅的海三國</p>
<p>互助條約簽字</p>
<p>在國聯秘書處正式舉行</p>
<p>對外交共同問題允合作</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　波羅的海沿岸立陶宛愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞三國恊商合作條約將於本日午後四點三十分在國際聯合會秘書處正式簽字、該約共計九條、茲摘要如下、　　第一條　簽約各國政府關於對外政策共同問題、應恊議以解决之、並約定在國際關係中互相恊助、</p>
<p>第二條　簽約各國政府每年舉行常會二次、此外經一簽約國之請求、得召集臨時會議、上項會議卽以代替一九三四年里加條約中所規定之愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞兩國定期會議、</p>
<p>第三條　簽約各國承認有若干特殊問題、各簽約國難於互相恊議、</p>
<p>第四條　簽約各國决定以友誼態度、根本解决足使簽約各方互相爭執之各項問題、</p>
<p>第五條　簽約各國應各訓令各該國外交人員、與其他簽約國取適當之聯絡、</p>
<p>第六條　簽約各國從目前起、卽將各該國對外簽訂之條約、互相通知、</p>
<p>第七條　其他未簽字於本約之國家、經簽約國一致通過後、亦得加入本條約、　　第八條　規定本約批准問題、</p>
<p>第九條　本約有效時期定爲十年、在滿期一年以前、倘未經宣告廢止、則本約仍繼續有效、嗣後須有簽約國中任何一國宣告廢止、滿一年後本約效力始行終止、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>東歐公約前途</p>
<p>德國表明態度後</p>
<p>現須視法國意嚮</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今晚英國半官式方面宣稱、關於東歐互助公約、德國提出備忘錄之後、談判之門是否關閉、惟在法國判斷之、如法國認爲尙可繼續磋商、則英國將依舊援助法國之見地、如認爲無可繼續、則英國大約亦將予以擱置云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　德國政府對於東歐互助公約業巳分函各關係國政府、表明態度、有人謂八天以前德國駐巴黎大使古斯德曾請外長巴爾都予以延見、謂有公文一件、須待面交、當經外部約定於上星期三午前會晤、乃古斯德忽又請求延期、據一般人推測德使所稱之公文、當不外關於東歐互助公約之備忘錄、其所以延期不遞、而必待至蘇俄加盟之事、在日内瓦行將成功之時始行提交法國政府者、其中頗有意義、深足玩味云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　俄法兩國建議之東歐互助公約欲得愛沙尼亞、拉脫維亞、及立陶宛等波羅的海國家之贊助現在似巳戚功、而波蘭欲使三國反對巳告失敗、此種發展殊爲重要、因三國雖小、亦將爲公約中之主要國家、德國巳明白表示、須軍備平等之後、始可再及他事、波蘭則似不願保證與立陶宛接界之處可無事故、蓋若干觀察者以爲波蘭對於立陶宛之領土野心、尙未饜足也、華沙方面曾正式否認、波蘭外長貝克嘗於七月之杪訪愛拉二國京都、游說兩國當局拒絶俄法之請、據波蘭當局所稱、貝克祗向二國聲明態度而巳、惟波蘭之態度旣非同情於公約、故游說之事容或有之、貝克去後三日、愛沙尼亞外長賽爾加馬卽赴莫斯科、未幾愛拉兩國卽照會蘇俄表示贊成東歐公約、歐洲列强之外交家均以爲波蘭外長之智不敵莫斯科、至立陶宛則因該約能保障邊境安全、早巳贊成、八月九日蘇俄外長李維諾夫托名就醫赴柏林、其實亦係就詞德國之意見云、（十二日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>蘇聯加入國聯後之遠東</h3>
<p>敬</p>
<p>蘇聯加入國際聯盟。任常任事之一。巳經大會通過。邀請入會電文。正待草發。事實上如無變化。是誠國際形勢之一大轉變也。歐洲紛亂之局。因德法意三國間之不調和。與中歐諸小國形勢之不安定。惡夢重重。乃致陷國際聯盟會議外交於停頓。會議外交停頓之後。而秘密外交之縱橫椑闔。代之而起。遂復返於一九一四年以前故態。錯綜複雜之情形。愈益加甚。其間關係最要者爲德意志。而德意志旣不能毁棄凡爾賽條約。又不能逕行合併奥大利。欲求唯一之出路。惟有東向與蘇聯爭雄。</p>
<p>然而蘇聯於此。巳早謀所以自衛之道。蘇聯亦自知所謂世界革命。向西發展。今日巳難實現。自身之建設。旣入正軌。决不肯輕於破毁。故先之以對意交歡。繼之以對法諒解。同時法國復苦於中歐諸國之離心運動。恐覇權動搖。乃急思挽回補救之道。其最有利者莫如重振國聯之頽勢。借會議之力。使德意志不能不屈就範圍。蘇聯此時。亦正欲運用其外交。以遏止德意志之挑動禍亂。自然與法有同感。此所以毅然加入聯盟也。</p>
<p>蘇聯加入聯盟以後。歐洲國際關係。重行整飭。德國雖巳退出國聯。然亦不敢罔顧一切利害。以與全歐爲敵。歐洲方面。或可從此暫保小康。而遠東方面將何如乎。日本爲退出國聯之有力國家。其退盟之主因。爲東北問題之爭持。此問題直接之衝突爲我國。間接之衝突卽爲蘇聯。今則日蘇之間。巳成爲直接衝突。且愈趨尖銳。蘇聯初欲以售讓中東路。換取遠東暫時之和平。然而日本用其敏活之外交手腕。一面由傀儡出面。故作價格之爭論。一面由日本盤曲週旋。使蘇聯外交陷於無可如何之境。現在對歐洲關係轉好。自可西顧無憂。將運用其全力以應付遠東。此其情勢之可以預測者也。</p>
<p>蘇聯國防。原側重歐洲。以中歐關係複雜。而反蘇之最力者爲巴黎。故西境警戒。至爲嚴密。頃者波羅的海三小國。互不侵犯條約。旣延長十年。對小恊約。又復正常關係。加入國聯事旣實現。從此可以集中全力於遠東防務。再蘇聯加盟而後。外交上取得法國之援助。勢巳顯然。對歐洲諸國。自不致如從前之隔閡。英蘇之間。亦將新闢商酌之途徑。此種現象。如擴大至於亞洲。則英蘇對立。亦可减輕。而英日聯合之機運。或將由是减少。故蘇聯加入國聯一事而果成功。則在遠東巳取得有利之地位。日本對之。所以極爲重視耳。</p>

<p>孫科昨晨歸國抵滬</p>
<p>暢述國際形勢日俄不至遽戰</p>
<p>今晚晋京出席立院全體大會</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、前月乘立法院休假期内、偕同眷屬及外交部駐滬辦事處長余銘等、赴檀香山避暑、並與美總統羅斯福會晤、茲乘昌興公司日本皇后號輪返滬、昨晨八時許抵埠、吳市長等多往歡迎、孫氏定今晚晋京、出席十四日之立法院全體會議、詳情分誌如次</p>
<p>輪埠歡迎</p>
<p>日本皇后輪昨晨五時進口、六時、停泊浦東昌興碼頭、各歡迎人員、均於曦晨齊集新關碼頭、分乘月寳鏡輝兩小輪、馳往歡迎、計有市長吳鐡城·内政部次長傅汝霖·實次劉維熾·中委張惠長·立委梁寒操·馬超俊·吳經熊·張知本·鍾天心·陳劍如·保安處長楊虎·公安局長文鴻恩·外部駐滬辦事處科長趙鐡章·李榮耀·交大校長黎照寰·及孫氏親友等一百餘人、孫氏偕衆乘月寳小輪、於八時許駛抵新關碼頭、卽登自備汽車、返哥倫比亞路私寓休息、孫氏自檀島返滬、携歸檀島跳舞花圈甚多、贈送各歡迎人員、故無論男女、均首套一花圈、頗感興趣、</p>
<p>晤美總統</p>
<p>孫氏在輪次向各報社記者發表談話云、本人乘立法院休會期内、偕眷赴檀島避暑、迄將兼月、茲因溽暑巳消、買棹賦歸、抵滬後略作勾留、定十三日晚乘夜車入京、主持十四日立法院休會後、第一次大會、在該次大會中、關於憲法問題、不致提出討論、此次在檀島、便中曾與美總統羅斯福會晤、但純爲普通之會晤、絶未談及政治有關係之各問題也、</p>
<p>國際形勢</p>
<p>各方電傳、日美關係、因日俄風雲之緊張而轉劇、孫氏謂、在檀島避暑兼月、覺日美兩國間關係、並未見有變動、不過往返兩次、途經日本時、祗知日本當局、對於軍備之準備、極爲積極、尤其是防空設備、但據本人視察、現在任何國家、積極準備防空、但將來一旦戰事爆發、其防空設備上、能否發生如願之效力、殊難斷言、至於日俄問題、兩國風雲、雖趨緊張、中東路買賣問題、似巳决裂、但料其戰禍、不至卽因此而爆發、進一步言、中東路交涉、雖瀕破裂、但兩國當局、尙希望以中東路問題、延緩其戰禍之爆發、第十五屆國聯大會、現巳開盤幕、深信國聯對僞組織問題、决仍本原有主張、始終否認、决不少異、至於英國實業考察團之赴東北考察、該團係英商人所組織、並非英政府所組織、係抱過屠門而大嚼之宗旨、至於英日同盟、締結密約云云、亦係日方所亟盼而放出之空氣、外傳雖盛、而英國迄無此意也、</p>
<p>美國經濟</p>
<p>孫氏繼答記者問題、在檀島雖不久、覺美國自實施復興政策以後、在表面上雖云較好、但在實際上、則未見眞好之現象、且覺其困難隨時增加、如大旱罷工等、在此狀况之下、復興政策在試辦期中、將來結果之優劣、尙難預測、現在美國一百人中、有二十五人之生活、要政府維持、卽此一事、可以證明美國復興政策之試辦、尙未得相當效果也、至於美國提高銀價、收歸白銀爲國有、係通貨膨脹政策、白銀每盎司以五角零零一收歸國有、但一方面卽以每盎司作發行一元二角紙幣之凖備金、卽可證明係一種通貨彭脹政策、同時我國因美國之提高銀價、投機者收買白銀、輸出圖利、當然於我國金融上有重大不利云了、</p>
<p>五全大會</p>
<p>關於中央籌開第五次全國代表大會事宜、孫氏以甫蒞國土、未悉其詳、但云、五全大會之召開盤、决不再延長、可斷言也、西南方面如有提案及正當理由伸述、儘可向大會中提出、因五全大會、爲任何人所不能反對、其理至爲顯明、孫氏又稱本人對大會提案、因距開盤會期尙遠、故尙未準備、</p>

<p>旅行事業文</p>
<p>—旅行事業對於國民經濟之貢獻—</p>
<p>中國旅行社昨發表、「旅行事業對於國民經濟之貢獻」一文云歐戰以後、世界各國皆注重於復興國家、紛紛講求增加出口貿易方法、藉可减少貿易之入超、而謀國民經濟之繁榮、世人常謂貿易隨國旗而往、嗣又稱貿易隨借欵而生、今日或者更可增添貿易隨游客而至一語、蓋近年以來、世界重商國家、巳深識無形輸出（invlsibleexports）（指外國游客所購之貨物及一切費用）之重要、因此旅行事業、當世遂視爲一大實業、公認在國民經濟上爲一種重要項目、况際此各國金聚不散、貨剩不銷、國民經濟、同感凋敝、朝野上下、益銳意於發展此種事業、藉以移富濟貧、借他人餘財、紓民生之窮困、故各國對於旅行事業、多方奬勵、特設旅行機關、用各種宣傳方法、招致外國游侶、旅行於本國領土、歲可得數千萬之收入、藉以補救貿易入超之漏巵、目下先進國家、對於旅行機關、不論其由國家辦理、或由私人經營、莫不認爲於國民經濟上負有重大之使命也、今就歐洲瑞士國而論、彼邦旅行事業之收入、竟佔國庫收入第一痊、其他産業貿易收入、猶多遜色、其收入方法、便如甲國向乙國施行宣傳政策、乙國人民若對甲國發生旅行興趣、乙國人民即往甲國游歷名勝古蹟、乘坐車船、往宿旅館、以及購買土産、則甲國鐡路輪船旅館商店劇塲等、均得沾其利益、吸引乙國游客巨額之金錢、且間接亦能將甲國物産美術、文化風俗民情、供給外人研究之機會、以期發揚國光、試以我鄰國而論、按照一九二八年之統計、其國外宣傳費全年雖達一百二十萬元之鉅、基因宣傳而招致之外國游客、一年内得二萬九千八百人、若輩因游覽而銷費數額、爲五千二百萬元、簡言之、因旅行機關之招致外賓、而國民可年得四千九百八十萬之收入、超過其宣傳費、當數十倍以上、其有裨益於國民經濟、固不待言矣、且旅行事業、不僅能使國民經濟之繁榮、且大有助於增進國際間諒解與好感、對於外交方面、亦有莫大之影響、試觀一九二九年、在日本舉行之萬國工業會、及太平洋國交討論會等、日本事前有國際觀光局、（JapanTouristBureau）爲歐美代表預備一切、如車船旅館、各地觀光嚮導、日本舉國上下、於外賓之招待、無微不至、殆及大會告終、外賓對於游日均有良好之印象、因此日本國際之地位、在無形中、增高不少、且國民之情感、旣屬融洽、更足以促進國際間互相親善也、竊查各國所設旅行機關、率皆受政府之奬勵、及鐡路輪船公司之補助、且爲一般人民所贊許、今將各國旅行機關狀况、撮述於次、以供借鑑、</p>

<p>英國　英國之發展旅行事業、類多聽任私人圖之、一名英國恊會、由商務部·鐡路·輪船·劇塲·旅館·百貨商店等機關出資經營、注重向海外宣傳、一名通濟隆公司、（Thos·Cook＆Son，Ltd·）係私人所設、該公司資本一百六十萬磅、在世界各處均設有公司及代理店提倡旅行事業、其他代售車船客票、發行旅行支票·旅行雜誌·及印刷品、並與萬國寢臺公司及中國旅行社等機關、訂有互相代理合作契約、在一九二九年間、僅美國游侶銷耗於英倫三島之金錢、不下四千萬金元、</p>
<p>美國　美國一爲運通銀行ＡmericanExpressCo·）、亦係私設公司、其組織及事業、與英商通濟隆公司大致相同、一爲國立公園、由鐡路方面出資經營、凡在都市商務會内、均設有嚮　局（informalionBureau）、專謀外國游客之便利、　　瑞士　瑞士有國立觀光局、由政府及各都市出資經營、對外賓誘　一層、非常努力、設有旅行嚮導局、由國庫及鐡路旅館恊會商會等公私機關供給經費、辦理旅行事業、凡游客之赴瑞者莫不特予便利、如護照毋庸加簽、鐡路可予特價、及其他種種優待辦法等、不勝枚舉、</p>

<p>意國　意大利政府深知提倡游歷、奬勵游客入境之利益、特置國立觀光局、與國有鐡路相輔並進、在美國與歐洲各大城市、咸有與當地接觸之機關、辦理問訊與售栗事務、指導旅館業、而謀其發展、恊助整理風景名區、發行游歷宣傳品、並以時舉行攝影競賽會、及風景與游歷成績展覽會、藉以介紹民情風俗、此外復發起公衆演講、開辦游客圖書館、舉行美術文化運動、增進旅行之便利、凡所以鼓勵游客者、無微不至、計一九二九年中、意國吸收美國游侶之金錢、不下三千萬美金云、</p>
<p>其他如蘇俄·瑞典·加拿大·土耳其·波蘭·墨西哥·希臘·和蘭·丹麥·爪哇·紐絲蘭·亞爾然丁·諸國、均有此種旅行機關、其提倡旅行事業之宗旨相同、惟規模則有大小之别而巳、反觀吾國對於此項國外游旅、則絶少注意而設法招致之、證之一九三一年之確實調查、美國旅客消費於各國之總數量爲五○二·七五七·○○○元、而中國僅得六·○○○·○○○元、在各國中爲數最少、其不注意於國外宣傳工作、可爲明證、否則以我國河山之秀美、出産之豐饒、工商業之逐步進展、凡可以吸引國外游旅者、决不止此數、至於國内交通事業設備未周、行旅隨在感受困苦、固亦未始非减少游旅之一因也、上海商業儲蓄銀行有鑒於斯、爰自民國十二年秋間、應社會之需要、創設旅行機關、初名上海銀行旅行部、至民國十七年間、始改稱中國旅行社、先設總社於上海、嗣後遍設分支社及辦事處於國内各大商埠及避暑地點總數巳逾三十餘處、專以服務社會之精神、力謀旅客之便利及舒適、經售國内外車船航空客票、預定艙位臥舖、代定旅館、運送行李、發售國内旅行支票、刊行旅行雜誌及指南書籍、代辦進出口報關及行李堆棧事務、代領出洋護照、承辦團體旅行、代僱旅行嚮導、計劃游程、計算旅費、并在遼寗·墟溝·徐州·鄭州·潼關等各分社、添設客房、藉供旅客往來住宿之用、又復在靑島設立招待所、今夏開辦以來、因租價低廉、設備完善、大有賓至如歸之槪、其次如首都、及浙省之奉化·金華·雁蕩·天目·天台·安徽之黄山、均在興建、餘如老窰·靈潼·華山·華淸池·西山·潍縣·濟南·南昌·杭州等處、正在規劃、類皆視地方之需要、定施工之緩急、近更與北平市政府合作、倣照歐美辦法製備游覽汽車、舉辦計劃包費旅行、（ＩnclusiveTour）指導旅行、（IndependentTour）及游覽團體（TouristParty）等事務、招致外國旅客來華、游覽北平、以期發揚吾國之藝術文化、民情風欲、俾其多獲興趣、并溝通國際間情感也、例如此次美國舉行芝加哥博覽會、申國旅行社亦乘機特編「新舊兩都」·「蘇杭」「泰山曲阜」·「華南」、「中國交通情形」·等各種英文指南小册、分寄歐美各機關及各團體、作爲來華游覽之嚮導、並徵集吾國名勝攝影、運美陳列從事宣傳招致外國旅客來華游覽、其用意至爲重大、簡言之、凡能爲旅客謀便利者、靡不悉心研究、竭其全力以赴之、幸承中外人士之贊助、故其業務日形發達、惟是中國旅行社、在吾國雖足稱爲唯一之旅行機關、著有相當成績、但較諸歐美各國之旅行機關、其範圍不逮遠甚、是在吾國上下通力合作、在國内則努力設備與建築、在國外則廣爲宣傳、俾游屐頻來、藉以發揚國光、并增加收入、或亦可與他國爭一日之短長也、</p>

<h3>讀書問答格物</h3>
<p>（一）每一突變無論如何總是質的變化。（二）碎了的玻璃和整塊的玻璃，在性質上多少總有點不同的，即使化學的性質一樣，物理的性質仍有許多不同。譬如對於光綫的反射力，碎的便與整塊的不同。鏡子打碎了，不能照人，這就是質變之一例。（三）鐡生銹，是化學上的氧化作用，激烈的氧化作用便是燃燒，所以鐡的生銹也即是一種緩慢的燃燒。普通的燃燒都是突變的現象，鐡的生銹却似乎是漸變的現象。但實際也並不然，鐡的生銹仍是許多很小的小突變聚合成的，不過是微小到我們普通不能覺察罷了。桌子的腐化，固然可以說是一天一天地漸漸形成的。但在腐化的程度還不大的時候，整個的桌子的本身不受影響，這不能算做質變。要腐化到一定程度，影響到了桌子的用途，我們才可以說桌子的性質變了。所以這也是由量到質的變化。（四）一切事物的發展的主因固然是事物自己内部的矛盾使然，但在發展中必須與外物發生關係，因此，發展的形式就爲外力所規定。内部的原因雖然是主因，但事物的具體發展，决不單靠内因，外力也是有一定的作用的。手壓玻璃和鐡生鏽等所發生的變化就是要由外力才能實現的事、但同時，如果不是玻璃，而是銅片的話，我們就壓不碎，如果不是鐡，而是金子的話，放在空氣裏便不會生鏽，雖有外力，若不是事物自身有可以變化的性質，仍不會變化的。可先變化的眞正决定者仍是事物自身的本性。（五）例如玻璃偶然落在地上碎了，碎是必然的，因爲玻璃有碎的性質，但「落在地上」的事，却不一定是必然，「落在地上」是「碎」的表現形式。同時，落在地上碎了的事實，是要有兩種原因才會實現：第一是撞落玻璃的力學的原因；第二是玻璃自身的脆性。這兩種原因的結合，就是所謂的兩種有規律過程的交叉點。</p>

<p>貢献話</p>
<h3>這一週間</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>這一週中國貨界有幾件好的消息：</p>
<p>敎育當局，通令學生制服用品，須一律購用國貨。南昌蔣委員長，通令全國禮服，須一律採用國貨。</p>
<p>實業部長注意國貨推銷海外，巳令國際貿易局積極進行。</p>
<p>婦女國貨年運動委員會，舉行各學校流動展覽，並派員分赴各地宣傳服用國貨</p>
<p>中國國貨公司，聯合九大國貨工廠，舉行「九一八」臨時國貨商塲。</p>
<p>家庭工業社，發起聯合同業各廠，舉行國貨化妝品展覽會。</p>
<p>我們在上面這幾個消息中，覺得中國國貨的生命，前途確是很有希望。行政當局，旣竭誠扶助，社會人士，又熱烈進行，而國貨公司國貨工廠自身，也在抓住機會不斷的在那裏發揮其貢獻社會的力量。尤其值得紀念的，是中國國貨公司「九一八」紀念的臨時國貨商塲，集九廠之大成，作公開之紀念，含義廣遠，意味深長。有人憤憤的說：「一次紀念，兩次紀念，三次紀念，通通是幻想，我們三年中在幻想中過生活，所得的敎訓巳經够受了，唯一的出路，是以眼報眼，以齒對齒，以大砲抗大砲，以轟炸機禦轟炸機，我們相信以武裝自衛，才可維持民族生存」這話很有理由，可是我還要補充一句，「我們唯一的出路，是一紙一針，要自給自足，一盃一盆，要不待外求，一絲一毫，不使外人和仇人來賺我錢去，我們相信以經濟自衛，才可維持民族永遠的生存。」所以紀念這慘痛的「九一八」，便應該時時刻刻不忘服用國貨，時時刻刻，要有貢獻於社會，才不辜負這種有意義的紀念。</p>
<p>可是有不好的一個矛盾消息，是廣東省徵收外省貨物特稅，是含有封建割據的意味，不啻摧殘本國的國貨。我想果眞愛國，果有良心，總希望這種消息是不確實的。</p>
<p>「國仇未復心還熱，服用何須仰給人。」有志氣有血性的中國人，大家醒醒罷！</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>國産前途的危機及解救</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>荆棘重重，暗礁時伏的國貨生産事業前途，正好像是命運早巳支配了他地，「多災多難」，總是常在暴風雨的侵襲下過日子，毫没有一些放鬆的機會，在本年，美國的通貨膨脹，提高銀價，想以匯兌屯併，來實現他的産業繁榮政策，和大批的仇貨，不顧血本的在我國各處大傾銷，本來巳足使我幼稚的國産前途，奄無生氣，而最近，在新頒的海關稅則中，復以各項進口稅的减低，自更給予一最强有力之打擊，於此生産過剩，「停工」「减工」萬分不景氣的籠罩影裏，一般從事國貨者，贍前慮後，果足灰心，可是，「多難興邦」，這是古人最好的勗詞，「益黑暗，找光明的心，也隨」</p>
<p>之益切」，我們正當抱這種精神，去打開現實的痛苦，與擴展未來的途徑。</p>
<p>談到解救國産當前厄運的政策，雖也很多很多，但大别起來，總不外要使全體國人，採用國貨與擴展國際貿易兩條捷徑，若能雙管齊下，當然尤好，敢略談如左。</p>
<p>一，深入到民間去：「提倡國貨」，要務求深入民間與普遍化，單是在都市裏一部份的空喊這是誰也知道不中用的，所以，年來各地國貨展覽會的風起雲湧，就是在作這宣揚紹介的初步工作，像最近西北展覽會意義的偉大，各廠所組華中，華北考察團使命的重要，在國貨進行到内地去的過程上，自尤佔相當之地位，而　　我人的尤所希望者，厥爲各地國貨公司的能如期成立，俾成全國國貨之網，像最近鄭州國貨公司的開幕，温州，嘉興，聞也籌備就緖，不日正式揭幕爲我國貨前途，放一異彩，自不待言。</p>
<p>二，推擴到海外去：中國本是一個地大物博的國家，祗以自己技術的幼稚和生産落後，至反受工業先進國貨貨物的侵略，其實倘能將各種産品，力事改良，精益求精，那麽也何嘗没有大量的出口貨品，最近報載國際貿易局鑒於歷來我國出品，均係由洋行代辦，因特介紹英美商人，直接採購，且有美商人某正在積極籌備，巳收集我國産一百五十餘種，將定期運往歐美推銷，確爲我國貨前途的一大福音，而南洋各地，因僑胞愛護祖國之心切，值此抵制仇貨之際，我國貨的亟須謀推銷該地，實尤屬不可坐失的機會。</p>
<p>勿灰心，勿氣餒，「只有奮鬥，纔是出路」，我們正應本此精神，去戰勝惡魔，找尋光明。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨的基本工作</h3>
<p>— 卞北辰</p>
<p>在十分之九没有受過敎育中國人的腦筋裏，他們雖是不曉得什麽呌做愛國，可是虚榮心却來得特别濃厚，日常生活，包括衣，食，住，行，都是無一非歐美貨是賴，因此，就造成了目前國内經濟恐慌！和國貨工工商業的不景氣！</p>
<p>於是乎一般劣等的國貨廠商，爲了要逢迎愛用洋貨顧客們的心理：換句話說，就爲了本身要賺錢的緣故，便在他們出品物名上用着類似外貨的名稱，或在放置出品物的紙盒上，及其他一切裝置出品的東西上，印着許多外國字，甚至於連一個中國字也没有，因爲這樣，便洋化了！洋化能使不識洋文而偏喜用洋貨的冷血動物，大量的購買。</p>
<p>在這裏我得聲明一句，我根本不反對國貨廠商用外國文印在他們的出品物上，如果他們的出品是推銷到外國去的話，但是他們的出品，完全是銷在本國境内的啊！</p>
<p>同時，我還覺得用外國文印在自己的國貨上，反能使眞正愛用國貨而無鑒别能力者，徬徨歧途，無所適從。</p>
<p>我以爲要提倡國貨，必須要實行基本工作，基本工作是什麽？第一是國人應當放棄崇拜外貨的心理，第二是國貨除非推銷到外國者不得用外國文，如能長此做去，定必三年有成！</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>小海關應該戒嚴</h3>
<p>— 張彰</p>
<p>海關的作用有二，一是防止外貨的侵入，一是保護本國的生産事業，其影響於整個國家的國計民生者，實至大且鉅，所以，凡是一個獨立的國家，或是希望自由平等生存於世界的國家，對於海關，是絶對自主的，因爲牠實在是國計民生的命脈所繫啊。</p>
<p>可是，我們中國，自海禁開通以來，關稅的權力，却操在外人手裏，於是所謂「海關」也者，不特不能盡保護本國工商業之責，同時，反而做了外貨入口　的門戶，以致年年入超，有增無减，國計民生，因而亦日見其拮據，這種情形，我們認爲異常痛心，希望政府當局，對於關稅，有自主之權，而减少外貨之入超，解救國民經濟的拮據。</p>
<p>准此，我們可以說：關係於整個國家的國計民生的大海關，應該堅决的自主起來，換句話說：便是應該大大的戒嚴起來，使外貨不能越雷池一步，不過，同時我們再退一步想，對於各個人身上的小海關，也要切實的下起戒嚴令來才好，什麽呌做個人小海關的戒嚴令呢？這一句話便是說：我們防止外貨侵入，在國家方面講，固然應該用政府的力量，力求關稅的充分自主，在個人方面講，除了穿的，用的，各項需要，應該儘量的服用國貨之外，同時，對於吃的東西也千萬不能讓外國貨入口，這便是我的所謂小海關應該戒嚴的一個解釋。</p>
<p>你不信嗎？請閱九月一日各報所載着的消息：</p>
<p>「國際貿易局消息：中上階級用以欵饗嘉賓之魚翅進口值，本年七個月，計八·九八·○七二金單位，折合國幣爲一百七十九萬一千六百五十三元，較去年同期，大見激增，因去年七個月，僅一百二十八萬零七百三十元，故激增五十餘萬，僅本年七月份，計一·○八·五五五金單位，折合國幣爲二十一萬六千五百六十七元，大部消耗於本埠方面，由此可見滬上人士享用之奢」云云。</p>
<p>唉，記者見到這段消息，不禁擲筆三嘆，認爲這是我們中國人的恥辱，尤其是上海的資産階級的恥辱，在國難如此嚴重的情形之下，大家還是儘量的恣情作樂，這眞是一件令人十分憤慨的事</p>
<p>所以，我在這裏，提出一個小海關應該戒嚴的口號，來貢獻於一般資産階級而恣情作樂的人們，請從今而後，注意小海關的進口物，是不是有外貨混入，這樣，今後的入超，庶有减少之可能，今後的新聞紙上，才能不再發現使人痛心的消息。</p>
<h3>本刊預告</h3>
<p>九月二十日應出之第八十六期本刊，茲爲紀念起見，於九月十八日提前刊行「九廠國貨臨時特刊」。惠稿諸君，如撰文字，以三百字左右及饒有意味者爲合格。</p>
<h3>從「洋貨店」說到「國貨公司」</h3>
<p>— 葉奕頥</p>
<p>最近，各地紛紛設立國貨公司，我們顧名思義，覺得眞是一個很好的現象。由國貨公司，蒐集着國内各地的本國貨品，一方面像是一個國貨展覽會，使當地的民衆，對於國貨，有一個相當的認識：另一方面，將國内各廠商所有出品，集合起來，讓内地民衆，有一個良好的選擇購用之機會，法至善也。</p>
<p>但是，如今，我們且來考察一下，内地關於國貨和洋貨抵觸的一種情况，以及洋貨在内地的一種潛勢力是如何？</p>
<p>我們知道，無論國貨與洋貨，其推銷之機關，統名之曰「商店」。「國貨公司」這一個名字，還是不多幾年中聽見的一個名字呢！那末，在有「國貨公司」這名字之先，與乎有了「國貨公司」這名詞的現在，譬如一般人要買起衣料來，總是會說「到洋貨店」裏去買啊！在内地，從前和現在，是如此：在上海，亦未始不如此呢，朋友，你没有聽見人說過嗎？要買衣料，「哦！小東門幾爿洋貨店去買吧」！</p>
<p>實在，「洋貨店」，這一個名詞，巳是深印在一般人的腦袋中間了。許多人，總是會隨口而出：「洋貨店」。就是這一爿店中有國貨，或是没有洋貨的，一般人，也仍是會得說，「洋貨店」這個美名呢！</p>
<p>唉！言念及此，能不痛心？好像舍「洋貨」外而没有國貨了，非「洋」莫屬，非「洋」非貨也。「國」，這個字，是亡去了，在字典上是没有了：無「國」又焉有「貨」之理，唉！</p>
<p>個人認爲，要在内地普設國貨公司之前，應注意：</p>
<p>（一）把「洋貨店」這名字，根本打倒，使一般人心目中没有這一個名詞：要做到這，除一般人的自覺外，更應想一個方法，凡購用貨物，不至「國貨公司」者，是一件萬分羞恥的事。</p>
<p>（二）内地的「洋貨店」，專銷洋貨：凡店商，宜自覺，將洋貨停賣，樹立「××」或「×××」國貨公司之招牌來。</p>
<p>（三）將「國貨公司」推行到内地，更應有一個有組織有力量的指導集團；此外當地敎育當局，更宜恊助之。</p>
<p>（四）宣傳是一種有效的政策。</p>
<p>上述四項，是否有當，敬祈讀者指敎！</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>嚼字</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>到現在，總總還覺得是件可惋惜的事，土耳其廢除阿拉伯字母而改用拉丁字母。阿拉伯字母，習寫都很簡單，有緊嚴的格律，而且很能應語言之變。改用拉丁字母，徒增加笨重，而且習讀時學正楷，書寫時學草書，尤見不便。</p>
<p>除了中國系文字，大部分的亞洲的合音字母，頗有比歐式的拼音字母好的地方。確定和簡單，最顯而易見。兩者的有廢，至少應該有同等的機會。</p>
<p>語文合一，是一句淺出而不是深入的話。所謂合一，是說寫出來的文，讀出來成語，至於怎樣寫出來，據什麽而寫，其經過中，有視覺與聽覺的錯綜，其錯綜是交換而不合一。</p>
<p>歐式文字，由視覺見到物，轉成聽覺上的語言，在聽覺上分析爲字，轉成視覺上的形體，再轉成語言。亞洲式字母就省一重聽覺上的分析。</p>
<p>理論地說，中國文字，其搆成經過更短，他是由視覺的物到視覺的文字，再轉爲聽覺的語言。自然有人要說，視覺的物一定搆成物的意象，意象就是語言，經過並不會較短。對這說法我不想有所爭論，我們的問題，可以避免這樣複雜，而換成一簡單的機械說法。</p>
<p>天文學上一致以⊙代日，數學上一致以　代三角。如果這個視覺上的物不由人的光的感覺轉爲聲言，而由機械的感光轉爲聲音，則同樣的機械一定轉爲同樣的聲音的。</p>
<p>在和方面，都很證明人類是頗相同的機械。歷史把我弄成複雜，在不必要的方面，我們該求减少一點複雜。如果機械的語言可以成功，以一定的聲音表示一定的意象，似可達到基本的語文合一。</p>
<p>現在的機械感光而成的聲音，總不免是電波式的，我們將來是不是能造一機械，感⊙　等形的光，而轉成近於人類的聲音，現在似不能知道。留聲機片的蠟盤，有聲電影語言部份的膠片上的波紋，是能再轉成人類的語言了，但這類波紋是否可由人造，造時又是否有相當的自由，也都是問題。</p>
<p>也許，造一種爲全人類所共同了解的形意的文字的理想是終該放棄的。那末現在就承認統一拼音爲最近所能有的唯一改革。這改革下也應該有點理想，而不是拉丁字母就可以滿足一切。</p>
<p>如果一個Ｉ字，能在感光機械下發底音，ＭＩ兩母能發米音，則推行拉丁字母自然可有永久的便利。西洋人能否有這造就，還不可知，縱能似爲期也遠。至於蠟盤，膠片上的波紋，現在雖也繁難到不能作日常的應用，而使其改進到簡單到成一種新體字母，却不是渺遠的希望。</p>
<p>製片商巳希望數年之内，，能在書齋内造出别種語言的聲片拷貝，借得比重行收音簡省，準確的利益。其成功之後，勢必進一步希圖繪製波紋的簡省，當也非不能成功的。</p>
<p>或者有人以爲人類的腦旣然能作比機械更巧妙的反應，又何必待機械的證明。可是所謂巧妙的反應是由精力積聚來的，中國字的所以不便，就因爲須要更久的訓練，積聚更多精力。機械如能同等反應，就不單證明反應的經過簡單，而且機械能代替一部份須費的精力，豈不更好。</p>
<p>第一式的國語注音符號，自來就被語言學者譏爲太笨，但事實上羅馬式的笨也只是程度之差。今日理想所能及的，巳經可以再越過些。</p>
<p>不用怕理想中的字母遥遥無期。要知道就我們立卽推行拉丁字母也非十年不能推行開去。以爲能怎樣救急，是靠不住的。</p>
<p>如爲救急，現有的感光發聲的讀書機，到也是一條路。試取了反應種種的中國字，察定了所成的聲音。那音波是不難如收無綫電報樣轉爲語言的。但怕音波比字更要複雜，可是我們總不妨一試。</p>
<p>可是問題又來了，這條路縱然可通，那一本書轉爲音波，再轉爲語言後，確可使文盲聽荱呢？我們現在，大問題實在不在未有嚼字的辦法，而在咬文的辦法太多了。</p>

<h3>我怎樣寫劇本（續）</h3>
<p>— 奥立莎作宜閑譯</p>
<p>他愛上了瑪莎。</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>一個孤獨的老頭子愛上了一個年靑的女子。</p>
<p>大約，在一個什麽時候，他醫好過她的猩紅熱罷。那時她十三歲。那時他就愛上這小孩子了。</p>
<p>他引着關於他自己的下面的詩句：</p>
<p>「用了告别的微笑，愛也許會使我的凄凉的結局光明些兒的。」</p>
<p>於是哭了。有一回，他哭得這麽利害，他的衣襟全濕了。</p>
<p>一個孤獨的醫生同着浸透了眼淚的衣襟。</p>
<p>他倒自以爲是有趣味的人物。</p>
<p>爲什麽他是醫生呢？我在有一篇文章裏曾經說過戲劇中帶着的武器問題是影響到劇本作法的。在這劇本裏，我凖備着殺害的塲面。就用做醫生的人來計畫這一種殺害。醫生來幹殺人的事比較容易些。這麽一來，就什麽阻碍也没有了。醫生有着毒藥，就算没有，要得到毒藥總也容易。因此，我就把醫生的職業給予兇手了。我想像着：這個醫生愛着藝術，愛着舞台，他這纔有着特殊的人生觀。他是從藝術的三稜鏡裏看望人生的。他想像得到異常的舉動。</p>
<p>瑪莎從工作的地方回到家裏來。</p>
<p>那丈夫納着悶。「你怎的這麽遲？」她總是在相同的時候回到家裏，可是他總問她怎的這麽遲。這就是他的性格。他是想到吃了，他正等着夜飯。他見到使自己覺得肚饑的理由就在他老婆的形相上湧現出來。</p>
<p>瑪莎把她的父親預備起頭的夜飯弄好了。</p>
<p>他們坐下來吃夜飯。</p>
<p>我们尖這個劇中裏把日常的談話試用試用看。那一種儘管轉換話題的雜亂的不連貫的談話。</p>
<p>他們吃着夜飯。</p>
<p>丈夫（向瑪莎）「喲，你剪過頭髮麽？」</p>
<p>瑪莎：「哦！昨天剪的！你没有看到麽？」</p>
<p>丈夫：「葛芬克爾醫生眞是十分那個呀。」</p>
<p>父親：「瑪莎，當心些。看弄髒了檯布。我一直說他發瘋了。」</p>
<p>瑪莎：「我切得並不太小罷可是？」</p>
<p>父親：「橫豎做舞臺醫生，有什麽要緊？」</p>
<p>丈夫：「他在馬路旁邊整夜的坐着。怎的我們没有火柴了？」</p>
<p>瑪莎：「你拿他尋開心呀！他是很好的一種人。火柴我剛纔看見的。」</p>
<p>父親：「看啦，每回吃到最後的一道點心，總是覺得太多了的。」</p>
<p>葛芬克爾醫生進來。</p>
<p>他們問他爲什麽整夜坐在馬路旁邊。那丈夫在長沙發上躺下去。</p>
<p>丈夫：「我回家來看見我們的醫生坐在那里。這是什麽意思呢？起初我還認不出他來。」</p>
<p>瑪莎：（向丈夫）「我來拿一個枕頭給你。」</p>
<p>父親：「給他一個。」</p>
<p>丈夫：（把他那關於醫生的故事說下去）「還有一層——淋着雨啦。謝謝，瑪先加。」（瑪莎的暱稱——譯者註）</p>
<p>父親：「不錯，昨天下雨的。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「就在那里我看見葛芬克爾醫生坐着………」</p>
<p>這劇本的主題：社會主義的社會必須是完全的社會。葛芬克爾醫生覺生了下面這樣的意見：如果整個社會的制度好起來，那麽社會的每個分子也非好起來不可。在的社會主義的社會裏，人們應當更純潔，更高尙。</p>
<p>這就是葛芬克爾的意想。他知道世界上進行着某種鬥爭，知道這是暴烈的鬥爭。對敵人表示什麽慈悲是不行的。然而醫生却想着没有階級的社會。在他看來，要實現這樣的社會，一種預備是必要的，没有階級的社會是人們之間的關係一定完全的社會，這一層應當說給人們知道纔是。據葛芬克爾的意見，在没有階級没有階級的社會裏，必須好好兒注意着人們的性格，以及人們的改善。</p>
<p>他見到的是：</p>
<p>一個好的女子愛着一個壞的男人。瑪莎愛着一個利己主義者。一個淺陋的性格，一個有着有産者性質的人。這怎麽行呢？這難道是對的？這裏可不是有着什麽錯誤麽？如果這裏有着錯誤罷，那麽就非把牠解釋一番改正一下不可了。這怎麽樣纔能够改正呢？</p>
<p>丈夫：「我們正等着你呀，醫生。你在馬路旁邊幹什麽，你可以告訴我們罷？」</p>
<p>醫生：「我是想解决一個問題。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「一個問題？」</p>
<p>醫生：「是呵。如果在社會主義的社會裏，一個好好的女子愛着一個壞的男人了，該怎麽辦纔好呢？」</p>
<p>丈夫：「你所謂壞的男人指什麽？你以爲世界是好人和壞人造成的麽？」</p>
<p>醫生：「我是這麽想的。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「社會分成了階級，可並不是照着性格分開來的」</p>
<p>醫生：「這我也知道，但我的心裏却還想着没有階級的社會。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「咳！没有階級的社會還遠着——他們說，要到第二五年計劃完畢了。」</p>
<p>醫生：「没有這麽遠。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「那麽你以爲在没有階級的社會裏，不會有性格鬥爭的麽？」</p>
<p>醫生：「是。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「有趣呀」</p>
<p>醫生：「很有趣的。譬如我以爲在没有階級的社會裏，他們會把利己主義者殺死的。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「瞎話！」</p>
<h3>他買一隻鞋子（下）</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>一會兒，木脚被搶了，手裏的銅版做了他底武器。過去的勇武的幻影掠過他眼前。習慣好鬥的他興奮得像一匹被激怒的，巳經預備好了姿勢的蟋蟀，突然站起來猛撲過去，但因爲重心失了平衡而倒下來了。</p>
<p>一個神像樣有着固定的姿勢的警察從人堆裏鑽出來，兩手向後伸着，推開那些踮起脚，伸着𩓐子，口裏嚕嚕囌囌地批評着的觀衆，毫不着緊地喝道：</p>
<p>「什麽事？打人麽？……」他職務地拖起那仍舊揮着拳的兵士，眼晴向四周望。</p>
<p>老板馬上轉過身來，雙手規矩地下垂着，做出斯斯文文的樣子：</p>
<p>「唉，警察先生，我們做生意要講公平交易，鞋子一定要買一雙的，要是人人都買一隻，那我們連捐也繳不成了，那位大哥却……莫說他是十九路軍，就是二十九路軍也只好對不起了……」</p>
<p>「………」警察不感興味地脫了帽子玩弄着，打一個呵欠，然後攢了攢眉高聲說：「到局裏去再講理罷。去！」</p>
<p>兵士閃着好奇的，然而鄙屑的眼晴，緊閉着寬闊的嘴吧，扶住木脚站了起來，他轉眼望見那紙盒子，便用貓捉鼠的姿勢，伸手把紙盒子捉住。</p>
<p>「上局？倒很好，我還没有會過你們底局長呢。」兵士做出冷酷的笑容。「我犯了法了？什麽的法律呀，我不懂得。我只有一隻腿，另外的一隻送了給我底親愛的同胞了。說要你們送鞋我穿，那是太過份，可是爲什麽不許我自己買鞋呢。」</p>
<p>警察切實地執行他底任務了，張開兩手指揮着穿了秋絨衫褲的胖胖的老板和那斷腿的兵士在前頭走。三個極不相襯的傢伙一拐一拐地朝那漸漸陷入黄昏裏的永漢南路，永漢分局走去。</p>
<p>觀着的人像饜足了似地散開了。剩下三兩個黃包車伕和一些流浪的孩子們還好奇地，窺探地尾隨着那三個像舞台上表演滑稽戲似的脚色。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>除了李士廉，對周秦故事，連汽車夫都懂一點，同時玩味起來，都覺秦始皇雖是暴君，魄力可眞大，於是一致的贊歎着。說時，車輪子忽然洩了氣汽車夫下車打氣，大家也下車散散步。路邊上正有個堡子，有個白鬚老人，靠了堡門，坐在地上。常秘書走向前道：老漢，這呌倽地方？那老人道：這裏是個空寨子，没有水喝，說着，他扶了壁子，戰戰兢兢站起來。大槪他耳聾，所答非所問。程志前正因爲是個空堡子，倒要進去看看。於是先在前面走，探進這堡門去。這堡子土墻倒整齊，可是這門，就剩了個土圓洞，半片木頭没有。進得堡子去，倒有一條直路，兩邊盡是人家。然而這人家全是家徒四壁的，胡亂在墻中間圈地裏種了些糧食。走到堡子中間，乃是個十字路，四周一看，東西南北全是橫七豎八的土墻。不但没人影，連人聲也不聽到，那矮墻縫裏，整叢的靑草，兩個黄毛長耳兎子，聽了生人說話亂竄着走了。常秘書道：没有這兩個小生物，倒還罷了，有了這兩個小生物，更覺凄凉了。說起來，这是秦始皇的故都，我們這後人眞慚愧。說着，扭着頭四處看。程志前道：還是那話，天實爲之，謂之何哉了。李士廉這時，也不覺有動於中，便問道：常秘書，這堡子裏雖没有人家，地還是種的老百姓分明還在附近，有没有區長堡長呢？常秘書道：大槪有的吧？李士廉道：有堡長那也罷，堡子再荒凉些，也不相干。程志前道：李先生這話怎講？有堡長就可以救荒嗎？李士廉道：不是，你看，整個村莊無人，官廳攤起捐稅來，怎辦？有了堡長，那不要緊，找到堡長，唯他是問，捐稅自然有法可收了。他這個發明，大家聽着，都愕然起來！（一八）</p>
<h3>人力車</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>我說：「中國内地的人力車，是物質文明的前鋒，凡是有人力車的地方，都市的一切新建置，新供備，便漸漸的輸送過來了。」</p>
<p>但是人力車的發祥地，日本，因了别的交通工具極度發達，便漸漸在减少。據從日本來的人說，那邊人力車的雇價，有時竟比汽車貴。</p>
<p>人力車在上海蘇州一帶，都稱「黄包車」，大約爲了他的顔色是黄的，渡江上津浦車，所遇各站的人力車，都是黑色的，所以那邊都稱「洋車」，洋車是東洋車的簡稱，記得蘇州在若干年以前，也稱東洋車的。東洋車的名詞，曾經在王壬秋先生的湘綺樓日記上發見過，說「元卿送東洋車來，看似甚顚簸，以奇車不敢乘也。」那年是光緖六年，王先生在成都做督學使者。王先生坐慣了騾車，見慣了二把手車，以爲人力車是奇車，其實何奇之有？也見得他對於新興事物，都有一點懷疑態度。這是當時士大夫的痼蔽，無怪李蓴客要反對造鐡路了。可是後來王先生垂着小辮子，帶了周媽到故都，去見袁項城，對於人力車的充斥，作何感想？不知道他嘗試過這奇車没有？</p>
<p>唱人道主義的高調者，以爲坐人力車是不人道的，但是在别的交通工具還没有的地方，不能不坐人力車。並且中國内地苦力的生計，正是十分窘迫的今日，人力車也救濟了不少人的飢寒。所以南京市政府特地提高公共汽車的票價，使人力車多得主顧。老實講，不是他們在贊助人力車麽？</p>
<p>自用的人力車以蘇州爲最考究了，最有聲勢了；在上海最矜持了，但是有一種北派的，用白布作篷，用黄銅作裝飾品，别有風槪，和繡花墊子電石燈的蘇州車大異。單就這一點，也有剛强和柔媚的分别呢。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>如其嚴格澈查起來，早午年的那一次中日戰爭，就是使中國大吃敗仗，以致把整個的高麗，拱手讓給日本的，那一次奇恥大辱，袁世凱的確也可以直接的被列爲罪魁之一。事實是這樣的：他原是一個性格。極暴燥的脚色，尤其是歡喜賣弄他的權威，他恨不能在一揮手之間，就把許多不滿意的人，一齊處斬。不幸得很，朝廷偏不曾瞭解他這種性格，當高麗國内發生緊急的變故的時候，中日雙方，各顯露着劍拔弩張的狀態，但朝廷方面，還想努力消弭戰爭；因此，就派袁世凱上高麗去斡旋，意思是要希望他做一個圓活的外交家，運用一些靈巧的手腕，和日本人交涉，把各種困難問題，暫謀妥恊。這中間，當然也包括着中國暫時無意作戰的暗示。不料袁世凱到了高麗之後，一味意氣用事，反把日本方面大大得罪了一番；恰值其時的日本人，正和一頭才出山的乳虎無異，極想找一個機會，試試他們自己的武力這樣，便立卽發出了最後通諜，正式向中國開戰，於是中國的國恥史，也在同時候起，揭露開來了！更可笑的是這件事變的結果，雖是如此惡劣，但袁世凱本人，却顚倒成了名（譯者按：這一段記載與事實恐不相符。）</p>
<p>除掉了這件事情之外，袁世凱還有一椿生平得意傑作，同樣可算是他的成名作。這件事情對於整個的中國，實無多大關係；但和滿淸政府所發生的關係，却委實不小。若是有人把牠搬演上舞台去的話，必不失爲一齣可歌，可泣，可嘆，可恨約悲劇。要叙述這件事故，必先詳論袁世凱的爲入。（一二七）</p>
<h3>蟹籪</h3>
<p>— 余夢我</p>
<p>夜沉沉地睡下去了，輕風從河面上吹來，使潔靜的波，起了些微的浪紋。渺小的星，四散地閃耀着，月兒還躱在雲端裏，没有攢出。我獨自在河濱徘徊着：賞鑑追自然的秋之夜。</p>
<p>遠處蕭蕭的蘆荻裏，隨風若斷若續地送出幾聲嘹亮的笛聲；漁舟上欲明不滅的燈光，映在綠波上閃爍得好像天上的落星。</p>
<p>這河畔的一切，是何等地美妙而含有詩意啊！</p>
<p>— 月</p>
<p>竹編成的蟹斷，若長城般圍在河心：捕蟹的人，利用他的智慧，張下如陷穽般的蟹斷，點上光明的燈籠，專候他目的物——蟹的光臨，以償他張羅時煞費經營的代價。</p>
<p>蠢笨的蟹，不知道人間的奸詐，錯認了光明之途，以致走入死路而不自覺，眞可憐啊！</p>
<p>但，社會上的人們又何嘗不是如此呢？</p>
<h3>乾涸的西湖</h3>
<p>— （何海生）</p>
<p>老天總是不下雨，杭州巳經大旱了三個月，所以近來很鬧水荒，自來水的鹽質太重，煮茶煮飯，都含有鹹味，使人難於下咽。</p>
<p>秀麗的西子湖，也漸漸的乾涸，祇是中心深處還有水，淺處早巳淤泥朝天，要是你到孤山放鶴亭去，那西湖博覽會橋巳經看得見橋脚了。至於淸香嬌艶的荷蓮，没有湖水的滋潤，光翰揷在泥中，迎風搖曳，現出了憔翠的顔色。</p>
<p>湖中的船還是有，不過祇有兩三艘，那些瓜皮小艇，都集在湖濱，船夫和船娘們，郵頭歎着氣，怨老天不下雨，斷絶他們的生計。</p>
<p>西湖乾涸了，飲料更感缺乏，所以有錢的人們，都駕着汽車到虎跑去汲水，有如山陰道上，不過將來泉水汲盡，點滴全無的時候，又該怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>上海縣城以外的城</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>上海的設縣始於元世祖至元二十九年，而縣城的建築則始於明世宗嘉靖三十二年。但在縣城建設以前，上海境内早巳有過不少的古城，特以年代久遠，遺址無存，人們很少注意罷了。</p>
<p>據舊籍所記加以考證，上海境内城垣要算闔閭城爲最古。漢書地址志注着：婁縣有南武城，闔閭所築以備越。太平寰宇記和吳郡圖經續記俱說：袁崧城東三十里，夾江又有二城相對，闔閭所築備越處。紹熙雲間志便引以上二說，作爲雲間名蹟之一。關於城址的所在，大淸一統志說：「南武城在上海縣東南六十五里，亦名闔閭城」，皇朝通志以爲在華亭縣南六十五里，而嘉慶上海縣志更直捷地指出闔閭城在上海境二十七保。除通志所指較難置信外，依太平寰宇記，城址應當是在浦東洋涇區，或竟在南滙縣境；依大淸一統志便當在周浦的東南；依嘉慶縣志又當在現時的高昌漕涇法華三區境。至於他的確實所在，因時間相隔巳有二千多年，漢唐以上的紀載又極缺乏，當然不易確定了。但吳郡圖經續記以爲該城原係防海道而設，那麽太平寰宇記所說的，可信程度自當比較稍高。</p>
<p>滬瀆壘俗呼蘆子城，太平寰宇記作袁崧城，吳地記和吳郡圖經續記俱作袁山松城。紹熙雲間志謂「滬瀆江側舊有東西二城，東城廣萬餘步，有四門，今徙於江中，西城極小，在東城之西北」。據晋史虞潭傳，潭在成帝永和中正官吳國内史，因饑荒和兵亂的緣故，便修滬瀆壘防備海寇。又通鑑晋安帝隆安四年冬十一月，吳國内史袁山松築滬瀆壘以備孫恩，明年恩自溝鹽進陷滬瀆，，由松被害。由此可見城的開築，猶在晋代以前。其後因受江水衝激，到唐代便巳稍有毁損，宋代就半毁江中，紹熙年間東城祇剩西南一角，元明尙有遺址可訪，淸初早成兩岸平燽，舊跡盡淹，但壘旁東西兩蘆浦的水，依然滔滔北流而入於吳淞江罷了。自上海開闢租界，外人填河築路，就是東西兩蘆浦也變成了斷流殘溝了。按現在的地址，考據東西兩城的所在，當在公共租界西區小沙渡路附近以東，閘北太陽廟南一帶區域以内。</p>
<p>袁山松除修滬瀆壘外，還在華亭縣東三十五里的地方，築起一座高七尺，周圍三百步的小城。通志名爲袁公城，大淸一統志依雲間志舊名稱爲築耶城。築耶二字的意義巳不可考，土人並城東的袁山松廟，也呼作築耶將軍廟。今城廟而廟尙存，在上海縣閔行區沙岡附近。</p>
<p>以上五城都築在上海設縣以前，明代因備倭寇的侵襲，曾築堡城三處，今南匯川沙兩堡，巳分屬南滙縣及川沙縣，而高橋區的寳山堡城，亦巳淹没入海，無從查考他的遺跡了。淸初兵部尙書蘇宜巡歷沿海各地，於順治十七年奏請在黄浦東溝北岸築一土城，名爲寨城，内設官署營房，配置相當兵力，藉以警備海盜的入犯。後因海疆無事，土城不久圯傾，未曾重加修築，設防兵卒亦皆盡數裁撤，今惟熟悉地方掌故的人們，知道那一處地方，曾經一度有過一個土城而巳。</p>

<p>昨銀洋市况、以舊習中秋節將屆、市上洋用漸廣、市塲形勢亦漸呈熱鬧、人心爲之一振、致各種市價咸有盤高之傾向、早午兩市洋折巳做至一角三分、較前日又加起二分、竟與上月間現銀外溢時相去無幾、而劃頭加水初時亦提高至六分、旋以需要無大量、故回至三分、拆票交易、早市轉帳及新交易三百九十餘萬、午市交易二十餘萬、小總會中交易五十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖八十餘萬、新做一百四十餘萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票額二百六十餘萬、電匯欵九十餘萬、外匯結欵四十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊什欵收解四百九十餘萬、進倉五十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百二十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊什欵收解三百八十餘萬、關稅欵五十餘萬、外匯結欵六十餘萬、進倉四十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百四十餘萬、外匯結欵八十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊什欵收解五百三十餘萬、出倉六十萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千五百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百五十餘萬、鈔票收回七十餘萬、發出一百二十餘萬、各路匯欵六十餘萬、解現三十餘萬、客路來源五十萬、去胃三十萬、</p>
<p>又本市票據交換所十二日交換總數、銀元九百零五萬零九百五十九元三角一分、内計銀元五百二十六萬八千一百三十五元六角三分、匯劃銀元三百七十八萬二千八百二十三元六角八分、</p>
<p>廣角銅元均微俏</p>
<p>昨江南小洋、仍與前日相同、早午兩市均做八百三十四元、做出交易、早市四千角、午市二千角、廣東小洋、早市曾跌五角、做七百四十七元七角、旋以交易稍暢、回上一元三角、爲七百四十九元、故結果較前日尙漲八角、做出交易、早市九萬五千角、午市六萬五千角、銅元仍繼續加長、爲三百二十一千文、較前日又好一千文、交易代價洋一萬一千元、合數額三萬五千三百十串文云、</p>
<p>證券　債市成盤旋局面</p>
<p>——交易大都係掉期——</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市面巳趨於盤旋混沌之狀、市上人氣閑散、見仁見智、所見不同、大戶買賣大多、大都仍係掉期交易、四號略有買進、洋拆掛一角三分、市上不受若何影響、雙方多數均在觀望、暫時恐亦無大波瀾也、昨日經過、開盤趨勢似疲、但以掉期關係、其漲跌未能一致、混沌恍惚、交易亦少、人心仍覺不振、次盤一致回小、鹽稅小半元左右、餘則亦小二三角、午後一盤、前列繼續趨小、鹽稅起以四號需要之殷、又轉上騰、故反漲四角、此後亦好二三角、市面平疲、一日結果、計小一二角至六七角不等、成交總數、計共一千五百六十五萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、美棉雖漲、然上日巳漲、故塲中人氣反爲平澹、塲中買戶缺乏、各月又跌二·三·四·六角、午後開盤市狀仍虚、拍至二三盤、聞現紗交易南方需求依然暢達、且有一部份云、本月份到期紗或有辦法、致市氣略堅、各月漲一·二角、全日成交統計二萬七千零五十包、查賣出恒益七百包、吉豐三百五十包、長餘六百五十包、頥大九百五十包、元一一千包、元泰四百五十包、泰昌八百包、大昶四百五十包、賡豐七百包、恊生五百包、永大五百五十包、買進同孚二千六百五十包、大豐一千七百五十包、永昌八百包、愼昌四百包、長餘五百五十包、長豐六百五十包、信誠五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>新花登塲</p>
<p>期棉市氣平靜</p>
<p>棉市平靜、美棉回漲十餘磅音、本埠人心、反見平淡、因上日巳漲三四角、人氣渙散、目前正在新花次第登塲之際、賣方心意較定、惟某棉行多額仍無動靜、不過天雨連綿、如果延久、與棉收當有不利也、</p>
<p>鄭標小有參差</p>
<p>標棉前市開盤、天氣惡劣、而外棉又漲、塲中形勢未見緊張、良以上日巳漲數角、買戶缺乏所致、加之目前正在新花登塲之際、空頭心氣安定、結果近月漲五分、遠月平平、午後無大變動、近平遠漲五分、全日成交統計六萬九千二百担、查賣出恒德二千一百担、錦昌一千四百担、均昶一千担、仁豐二千七百担、長豐三千七百担、恊成一千三百担、恊生一千二百担、長和三千四百担、潤康四千二百担、買進德記一千三百担、穗隆一千一百担、通記一千四百担、恒益三千三百担、賡豐五千一百担、益豐一千八百担、源大一千五百担、永昌一千一百担、同和二千五百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>美棉因抵空稍回漲</p>
<p>昨日美棉因賣戶缺乏、同業購進、及空頭抵補、市况靜而堅、結果現貨漲十磅音、期貨漲十二至十四磅音、英棉期價不動、印棉初因大批多頭了結、及投機商賣出而疲、後因日商及歐洲出口商買進略回、結果平果爾奥姆辣及白羅溪均跌二羅比、原電錄左、（十一日電）</p>

<p>期粉麥靜中帶穩</p>
<p>——市况盤旋成交無多——</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈穩定之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲二三角左右、坎拿大漲一三角不等、故開價後、各月份市面、巳較平穩、比之前日收價、計好一分左右、不過國内水旱天災之時、農村破殘、日益加甚、因之日常之購買力、亦爲之减少、故天時雖得透雨、人心似更和緩、但市值巳在低盤、致交易所市塲、出入反見稀淡也、迨至下午開盤、交易更見淸淡、授受雙方、互相觀望、内地帮因雨而停手、客帮則去胃不暢而靜待、因之盤旋上下、上落無幾也、結果本月跌一分二厘半、十十一月份跌一分二厘半、十二月份漲半分、一二月份跌一分、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份市面、巳呈穩勢、以洋麥報價、均回好一二三角左右不等、故各月份開價、巳帶俏利、較前日提好二三分、惟天下透雨、業内外之買氣、反見停寂、各月份交易寂寞、空拍不少、迨至下午開盤、交易比較活絡、惟内地多頭、頗有回出、致盤旋之中、微帶軟弱、結果本月份較好一分、十月份小一分、十一十二月份好一分、一月份好二分、現麥市面、略轉穩俏、因客戶扳緊、廠家應酬、高貨喊高五分、中次平平、開山東徐州麥三元六角半、次五角六分、蚌埠麥三元六角、次五角六分、頴州麥三元六角半、瑶灣麥三元六角、計開五千包、由福新辦去、</p>
<p>黃荳市面盤旋</p>
<p>昨日新陳黄豆、均無大變化、新豆出品優劣、銷胃有通州帮及本街、統市成交各豆七八車、計開正陽關豆二車、價爲三元三角四至二角半、頴州豆四車、價自二元八角半至八角、蚌埠豆一車、價爲二元六角半、歸德豆三百包、價爲三元、漢口信陽州豆開二元六角、江北帮辦去三百餘包、新豆去路有本街寗波及内地問津、所以市形轉平、計開城門豆三百餘包、價自三元七角三至六角半、漢口早黄開四百包、價爲三元五角至四角半、江北如臯新豆開三十包、價爲五元、比較前市跌一角云、</p>
<p>内地帮續辦客秈</p>
<p>現洋米到湧續跌</p>
<p>浙帮問津期洋米</p>
<p>昨日洋米續有一船到申、雖係應解路貨、然市上籌碼充實、人心巳見軟下、現貨小絞與安南粳尖各小一二角、西貢高貨缺乏、尙可站定、中關牌子則無人問津、全日售開洋米一千五百廿包、均爲本街收去、期洋米産價報大、售出者喊高五分、進戶觀望、交易反而呆木、全日由浙省寗紹帮辦去十一月份西貢五百噸、價估五元零八元、比前日較大三分、昨内地帮忽又活動、收買砶糙各米、寗紹帮亦有砶米問津、故客秈市面疲而復挺、全市開出五千多包、行情暗挺數分、如今明再有暢胃、市價尙可步砌也、</p>
<p>油市　忽漲忽跌之白桐油</p>
<p>白桐油上週漢市聲勢最盛、洋莊由三十一元八角起至三十二元四角、而三十二元八角、最高爲三十三元七角、共做開交易五六百噸、再接再厲、鋒銳無比、本週之初、尙能維持原價、稍有交易、惟數巳不多、祗數十噸而巳、因價格太高、辦者不免却步、據漢行開進襄桐二十七元二三角、湘桐二十七元五六角、數約千餘担、蓋市面巳登峯造極、雖來源不旺、然銷亦减色、故行家亦不肯多進、而昨晚本埠得有漢電、謂洋莊跌售二十二元二角五分、較上週廉去一元三四角、總因大漲之後、稍有回跌、亦應有之狀態、但各産地來源極枯、巳現靑黄不接、故欲其回進三十元一關、恐巳無望、預料漢市洋莊三十一二元、將爲普通之市面、本埠存積極薄、且因價高均不肯多備、但聞昨浙桐亦稍見跌、前售每砠三十元、茲巳改售二十九元左右、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<p>江寗秋蠶飼額不多</p>
<p>江寗各市鄉、因今歲亢旱、對於秋蠶類均無力飼育、更兼桑樹備受天旱損害、産葉售黄、雖經指　晨　、　動　、　代　　蠶　消挺、而飼職大减、即巳領種者紛紛退種、晚蠶飼額亦甚　寥、統計祇及春蠶十之二三、惟蠶　發育尙佳、旱蠶巳三眠開葉、晚蠶亦巳頭眠、蠶眠頗齊云、</p>
<p>紐約華絲未開拍</p>
<p>投一一七票反對者九○票</p>
<p>意絲商仍運動華意絲關拍</p>
<p>日前本市盛傳華絲巳於九月四日在紐約交易所開拍、刻據本埠某方面接該處來電云、華絲開拍、紐約交易所於九月六日最後一次開會表决、計出席經紀人一百十七人、結果投反對票者、有九十人之多、乃被否决、原因乃日本絲商以和權他溢、故盡力宜傳華意生絲、品質不良、如若上市、將來交割、反多困難、於賣買方面、定有莫大損失爲詞、與會者乃受惑而拒絶華意之請求矣、惟舊金山將有新交易所設立、握有生絲威權之乾利君、刻正奔走四方、竭力運動、俾華意生絲、得有在該地上市機會、是以華絲在美上市拍板、尙須有待云、（按乾利君爲意大利生絲大企業家也、（文）</p>
<p>珍眉綠茶一跌再跌</p>
<p>路莊珍眉綠茶、自新貨登塲以來、因華茶商個别競賣、市盤一跌再跌、各歐莊行家、觀察此種情勢、進貨益難着手、蓋就目前市價言之、抽芯珍眉、較開盤跌度、每担幾達百元之鉅、普通躉批貨、每担亦低四五十元、因之市面愈跌愈滯、愈滯愈跌、形勢異常不利、至針眉秀眉貢熙珠茶等項、亦均有跌無漲、據一般茶商觀察、綠茶市面、苟非穩定市價、似難挽回頽勢、</p>
<p>南北貨　新黑棗不日可到</p>
<p>黑棗近以到存均缺、市勢迭漲、極形堅俏、如高統手棗現市須十七八包之譜、惟新黑棗據地頭函、大約旬日内外亦可登塲、普通濟南黑棗不日即可抵申、聞苜批僅數十件、巳爲申帮辦入、進價不及十元云、</p>
<p>五金　蛋廠帮又辦馬口鐡</p>
<p>運銷歐美蛋廠家、前因海外市面不景氣、故在申廠家均候機停工、近日海外來電巳有起色、因之本埠各蛋廠家紛起收辦馬口鐡、以備運往、故前昨二日、一百磅美馬口鐡開出共有一千五六百箱、雙連每箱估盤自三十三元至三十三元五角不等、九十磅單連貨昨市亦有數百箱交易、行情每箱售十六元二角半、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>客觀環境</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>我對於任何一個問題，必定先想到一種具體或抽象的辦法，然後敢談話，敢着手，這是我個性如此，亦卽是我欠乏智識和冒險性的一點吧。</p>
<p>我對於大衆語的問題，也是抱同樣的態度，所以我對於大衆語第一篇發表的意見，便「討論一個更小問題，應該分别討論呢還是合併討論」，我的意思是；旣經提倡大衆語，（一）先應該想到大衆語的組織和生産的方法，（二）用怎樣方法推銷到大衆去？我對於這兩種的主張，前者主張用一種方言爲標準，因爲北平方言較爲普遍易行，故假定用北平語，後者現在的大衆，十之八九多是文盲，應該先用普及敎育入手，普及敎育旣不能望之於政府，只有一般智識份子——自居代表之流——應該自動先去做這一番工作，這是我在「更小問題」一文中所貢獻的一些意見。</p>
<p>但是近來看見和接到（大抵多有慢駡和說到問題以外的，本埠增刊槪不發表）反對我的文字，大槪離開事實不講，專說空洞的理論，或竟說到問題以外去，因此我說話之間，也不免放肆一點，痛快一點，便得罪了許多主張大衆語的先生們，這是我深爲抱歉的，不過對於一般無理取鬧，或譏笑慢駡態度的幾位作家，也只有用「不客氣」的態度來對付。</p>
<p>其實我的說話，雖似「反大衆」，但是我的主張，都是眞正站在大衆語立塲上說話，而主張大衆語的作家，又是站在客觀環境上說話，照尋常目光看來，其間天然有一個很大的隔膜，主張雖各不同，但都爲大衆謀利益爲大衆謀幸福的大前提，諒没有多大的差别，或者「反大衆」——本刊並不是反大衆，因爲人家說我們是反大衆——的主張，到還實踐一些，具體一些吧。</p>
<p>天然在一張報紙裏頭，本應該容納各方面的意見，把問題的核心，討論一個澈頭澈尾，水落石出的辦法，本埠增刊原亦抱此態度，但是本刊發表「反大衆」——的文字居多，而發表主張大衆語的文字遂少，因爲來稿之中，慢駡，無聊，談到問題以外的文字實佔多數，因爲省却許多煩煤起見，便把這些文字擱置下來，並不是什麽偏見，這是本刊絶對主張公開討論的態度，如有高見，極願承敎。</p>
<p>昨天我又讀到徐先生「請看客觀環境」一文，這明明是對「告心緩的朋友」一文而說的，但該文仍未談到問題的核心，依舊是一番空洞而無實際的論調，本來可以不必答復，因爲我要表明我個人的主張，和宣布本刊的態度起見，不得再來解釋一下。</p>
<p>徐先生的題目是「請看客觀的環境」，我第一句就得聲明，我們現在深處環境的中層，用不着再來看環境，尤其是客觀的環境，徐先生又說：</p>
<p>「大衆語是和大衆的一切問題相聯繫的，他决不是單單語文的改良運動，</p>
<p>他是整個的大衆生活提高運動中的一個運動，」</p>
<p>這種意想，我也早巳懂得，簡單地說，就是要改造大衆的環境，但是欲改造大衆的環境，僅僅靠語文運動，巳是效力甚微，而語文運動，又不去實際的工作，專門說空洞的好聽話，依舊是唱「空城計」一套把戲，那能使人不心急呢？（未完）</p>
<h3>黑流</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>只要等監工的李長麻子到路口，跟那賣粥姑娘開玩笑的時候，大家就囚徒鬆了綁似的，透口氣，灣灣腿，連血液的行動亦遲緩下來了。</p>
<p>「奶奶，咱們這一夥兒眞像牛啊！」小癩痢把鐡棍往地上一仍，搥一下自家見的闊胸脯，第一個開口說話，眼睛可偷偷地叮着路口。</p>
<p>「牛，嘿，牛還有人餵草呢。」</p>
<p>「索性投了畜生亦好啦，没有老婆兒子，没有家。」</p>
<p>「誰說不是當畜生好呢，那洋總工程師的一頭獵狗，不是要吃一塊大洋牛肉一天嗎！」</p>
<p>只要有人說開塲，便會你一句我一句凑上來，没結没完的。</p>
<p>滾壓機息在階沿石邊儘冒氣，在等候着特機施展它的威力，它要把地下層疊起伸張着的勢熖壓制個平服。層層澆上熱的柏油溶液。</p>
<p>整大塊的柏油給投在鐡鍋裏，無數强烈的火舌舐着鍋底，溶化啦，烏黑的烟夾着惡劣的氣息在這條路的空際迷漫着。站在柏油鍋爐邊的，澆柏油溶液的，拖燙咱面的滾筒的，和滾壓機上的司機，誰都有着一張烏黑的，上着透光漆似的臉。</p>
<p>「可以澆啦」</p>
<p>便一大桶熱的黑色溶液傾瀉過去，在太陽下泛着銀光，有幾個小工用帚子把溶液趕開去，伸展到没有澆着的地方，黑流哪！</p>
<p>生活在黑流裏的人羣永遠受火的炙熱和滾壓機的咆哮的。</p>
<p>拖滾筒的便踐上祗舖了層黄沙的溶流，拚出全身的氣力，來來去去，把路面燙平，熱的氣息從脚底直透上胸膛，喉嚨，而至腦壳，一陣暉眩，接着便聽到李長麻子的毒駡；「喂！奶奶的，照你這樣還是早點「歸天」吧！」</p>
<p>大扣子讓粗麻繩壓在自家兒肩膊上，一千斤重量似的，頸項裏的巿筋根根暴起，四面又綳滿血筋，脚，扔在烙鐡上一般燙，燙到心；「奶奶，多𠴰老子生一雙牛蹄兒般的脚，生一個馬頸兒般的頸根，挨不了啊。」</p>
<p>「誰挨得了？一樣的活在火山上，爲着幾角錢。」張半癩子長長地抽了一口氣。他的身子並不生的結實，懶懶的挨在人堆裏哼着，「哦唷來哦唷」哦唷………」</p>
<p>大夥兒全哼着：</p>
<p>「哦唷來哦唷，哦唷………」</p>
<p>滾壓機開始活動時，第二桶柏油又在鐡鍋裏溶化了。</p>
<p>滾壓機凸着肚子拚足氣爬了過去，第二桶柏油溶液傾瀉下了，這裏在黑流邊沿的工作着的人正透不過氣的時候，那邊路口李長麻子跟那賣粥姑娘調笑得亦透不過氣。</p>
<p>「他亦是人啊！他就有這閒興兒打趣人家姑娘。」烟霧迷漫中有人在說。</p>
<p>「丢臉的，全靠着洋鬼子，在洋鬼子面前拍馬，在咱們面前放威！」那推滾筒的老山東生就這副快嘴，老呌旁人替他擔愁。」</p>
<p>「老鄉，說話留些神！」小癩痢邊　着煤塊往爐子裏扔，邊對他呶呶嘴。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>「奶奶，誰做漢奸就揍誰！」老山東不服氣，可是，可是，</p>
<p>冷不防火塊般的柏油在他背後湧過來，脚底給戮了幾十亂刀似的劇痛，在「哇！」的一聲悽厲的呌喊中便倒下了，全身躺在火熱的柏油溶液上啊！大夥兒用棍棒把他往没澆到柏油地方拖。大夥兒的心在燒了，快焦了。</p>
<p>老山東就在這時没了氣，身子烏黑，燒焦了似的，爛糟糟的像烤猪，闖禍的早逃了，監工的李長麻子把活着的都駡遍了，衝開看熱鬧的去打電話，給官廳，給工務處。「媽媽，你們這夥雜種一個個去死！闖禍累老子。」</p>
<p>可是，第三桶柏油又在鐡鍋裏溶化了。</p>
<h3>流浪兒</h3>
<p>— 鴻</p>
<p>每天早晨，和下午五點鐘的辰光，弄堂裏送來了一陣尖削而熟聽的聽音：</p>
<p>「申報——新聞報……」</p>
<p>這是弄堂裏的人呌他做「小猴子」的喊聲。他的年紀大約是十二三歲吧？他自己也不大淸楚；同時，也不知道自己的姓名。他的模樣，確有幾分像猴子，他是一個營養不足而且失了怙恃的流浪兒！一副烏黑的瘦削的面孔，嵌着一雙陷落得僅看到一對弧形的眼晴。一件没有襟袖的靑布衫，和一條條子布褲子，滿濺泥汚和油漬，巳失了原來的顔色。弄堂裏的幾位姑娘們每遇見他，總是用小手巾搪塞着鼻子，甚或要扭過面孔向地上吐一口涎沫。</p>
<p>是去年的冬天？西北風刮得呼呼的呌，弄堂裏再也没有一個人徜徉，孩子大人們都在屋子裏圍着煤爐講故事，只有隔壁二嫂子每天淸晨進紗廠裏上工時，常看見他身上缚着兩條麻布袋，頭上戴着一頂没有帽頂的瓜皮帽，一隻手揑着鐡箍子，一隻手上挽着一只破竹籃，立在垃圾桶邊拾理雜紙破布，看見了人怯怯地白着眼晴。</p>
<p>有一天，二嫂子看他實在很可憐，給他一碗冷飯，於是，他每次來到弄堂裏必站立在二嫂子的後門口徘徊，等二嫂子送他一碗飯，才慢慢地離開弄堂。</p>
<p>時日不斷地輾轉着，他由呼呼的寒風裏而轉𢭘到這温和的春天了。他的脚手由紅紫的臃腫，而變成乾柴似的木片。</p>
<p>這時將近黄昏的時候——</p>
<p>「新夜報——大美晚報……」</p>
<p>弄堂裏照常的又發現了這聲音，在朦朧的夜色裏，他拉長着嗓子一聲聲的呌喊。</p>
<p>但是，最近巳有好些時又聽不到這尖削而熟聽的呌聲了，每當靜默的黄昏我便記憶起小猴子來，可憐，這無歸宿的天涯流浪兒，現在巳不知飄流於何處去了？</p>
<p>但是有人說弄堂裏這幾夜淸靜得好睡，没有了那小猴子的怪聲！</p>
<h3>失眠之夜</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>殘夜以後，周遭是一個靜美的世界，没一絲聲息，萬籟全沉入於夜的黑鄉中，幸福的人們早走進温甜的夢境，陶醉在幸福的夢裏邊了。</p>
<p>可是連這份福兒我都没法享受。</p>
<p>像鬼魂附在身上的感覺到一種從所未有的紛擾與煩亂。不曉得翻轉了幾千幾百遍，這也不好，那也不好，眼珠雖然緊緊地闓上，但神經却不肯休止的故意作梗的勞作着。越翻越興奮，越興奮想念越淸醒。而把記憶挑得朗亮的，就連平日巳經糢糊過去的一些古老的往事以及頂怕引起的愁惱，都一古腦兒螞蟻般的爬集到腦袋上。</p>
<p>眞是再也睏不成了。他媽的，我急燥到下意識地駡了出來。接着更没完没結的拼命搥着床板，抓着自己的頭髮，没有别的，希望儘可能的出氣力，可以讓身子和精神緩緩困倦下去，以至於從不知不覺的朦朧中入夢。但是都無效，動脚動手的結局，只洩出一身汗水，白賠了一番力氣。而睡神仍然不來，神經還是一樣的淸楚，半點也不覺疲憊。</p>
<p>應該痛恨的睡神呵！</p>
<p>深深地感得失眠的痛楚比失纞的痛楚更利害。</p>
<p>眼皮確是累得要命，要睜開都十分艱難，然而腦子則相反的愈見淸晰。這怎麽辦，想盡了方法都不中用，桌上的站鐘巳敲過三響，這是在夏之夜，太陽起的格外早，看看天是快亮了。用了任何一種法兒想睡，没一個有效</p>
<p>於是我也不睡了。反正怎麽着都睡不了。索性便溜下床來，撳亮燈火，抽根烟，兀自踱到窗前。</p>
<p>呆呆地站立着，擦擦瞇矇的眼珠。望望天，月亮巳沉了。只賸下幾顆星子掇在蔚藍色的天空上，没勁兒地。忽然一陣冷冷的風吹上身來，使我打了幾個寒噤，皮膚起一些鷄皮粟子。同時這吹來的風，就帶來一種如這寂寞的夜景般凄淸的感覺，心裏隨卽泛上了一陣荒凉的顫抖。而感到了彷彿被一切的東西所遺棄的類似的悲哀。</p>
<p>爲了碰着世間不幸者同樣的遭遇，這些日子便離背家室，遠遠地流浪在異鄉，咬着牙根過窮生活，這長長的時日就溺在失了歡笑的悒鬱裏生活的厚塵，和感嘆於人事身世的濃重的愁雲，就霧似的，濃重地掩蓋着我的思想，我的心靈，因過分的憂慮，就失眠了。而憂慮的份量，總無可能消減，於是失眠症遂隨着憂慮的增加而一天天的沉重了。縱敎憂慮不至於摧折我的身子，而此失眠症却足够壓倒孱弱的生命的。也不曾因此有何種悸動，橫豎活着没趣味，這人世不會有給我什麻美滿的贈賜。就讓生之惡魔任情去蹂躪吧。</p>
<h3>鄭孝胥之流所謂“滿洲樂土”</h3>
<h3>亭子間作家</h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>像鴿子籠似的，房子的幅面，不够五尺寬放着兩隻牀，兩隻寫字檯，所有的地方就幾乎被佔光。來訪的客人要是在三五個的話，簡直便連住足的空兒也没有了，在冰凍的冬天裏倒容易過去，但是一到炎炎的暑天，日子可就難挨了。一只窗巳是小的再小没有，又是朝西的，整個下午起就滿滿曬了一屋子的强烈的太陽，落火似的，儘蒸發着一陣陣悶煞人的鬱氣，躱在裏邊，就如放在蒸籠的餛飩一樣。粗大的汗顆子不停地流了下來。</p>
<p>兩個子便在這種塲所生活着。</p>
<p>—你們現在住在什麽地方？—</p>
<p>誰個問着的時候，他們都像約定似的不回答，如果你再來一句：還是亭子間？</p>
<p>—自然囉，不是亭子間難道是高洋房子不成？</p>
<p>回話的話氣帶有幾分憤慨與傷心。不過這是他們慣常的態度。臉上仍然是浮着不在乎的微笑。</p>
<p>一輩子就永遠跼蹐在亭子間裏邊活受罪有時想了起來也會不自禁的覺得悲哀，而這悲哀的延續往往是非常短促的一下子又忘記了。其實他們兩個子每一個的入息並不算小，要租那種較舒適的房子自然不是無辦法。但是從來都是這樣：錢一得到手，鎭日價便到外頸吊兒郎當，喝酒，跳舞，咖啡座，盡情地縱樂着，輕輕地不上幾日的工夫，就把整個月辛苦得來的收獲花個乾乾凈凈了。</p>
<p>在錢快花光的那最後的一個晚上，天色快發亮了。他們才從舞塲裏拖着没勁的脚桿跨了出來。一步一蹶地，蕩在深夜的人行道上，像幽靈似的。</p>
<p>夜風冷冷的吹着，好像將他們昏迷的神經吹淸醒一些了。有一個說着；</p>
<p>—這樣模胡鬧下去眞不成話。吊兒鋃鐺的生活只能寫出些要不得的吊兒鋃鐺的東西，仰樣的文章寫不出。再過些日子怕連此亦没法寫呢？眞是等於毁了自己，我想以後要認眞點，埋頭創作，寫出一二部驚人的作品來。</p>
<p>聽了這話的另一個，只朝了說這話的一個瞧了幾眼，一聲不響。他心裏正亦發生此種同感的。但他巳對於自己失掉了自信力。隔了一會，才慢呑呑的帶着，低低的太息說道：</p>
<p>—想要能够産生滿意的作品，須得先把生活嚴肅起來。如像如此永遠是一種夢話。</p>
<p>嘴巴亂扯一陣事實上不一定做得到的。從那一定起，他們兩個子雖是發誓不再上街，關了門各自埋頭寫作。但也是爲了錢巳花盡，不然的話仍是會放浪如舊的。每天打早上到晚間，坐着桌前，對着攤開的稿紙發恨，一個預備寫一篇中篇，一個預備寫一篇幾萬字的劇本。可是挨上了半天，還寫不上一行字，想破了腦袋總不出要怎樣開題，想不出一個合意的故事來。稿紙一張撕過了一張，到最後都扔下了筆桿無可如何地抽了根烟。</p>
<p>「怎麽辦，想寫也寫不出，怎麽辦？」</p>
<p>吊兒浪當的生活祇能寫吊兒浪當的東西，腦袋都給弄歪了啊。」</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>互視了一下，兩個同時深深太息了一陣子。</p>
<p>這太息居然持續了幾天的時間。而其後，他們索性不管一切了。依然過着那種没條理的生活，越來越頽唐了。而且拚命寫些無聊到再不能無聊的稿子，他們不願意去設想前途是光明和黑暗。只求過了一天算一天。現在逢着人都說：「亭子間的作客是没出路，只好依然没落」</p>

<h3>叔叔的辮子（四）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>時敏所眼巴巴等待着的中秋終於過去了。現在想起來，除了那天晚上吃芝蔴月餅，以及那一條用紅紙糊成一條龍的藕以外，一切都是十分平凡的過去了。說起那條藕，姑媽眞是聰明極了。她將紅紙剪成龍鬚，還有尾巴，再在香爐裏取了幾根香棍，上面粘着三角的紅旗，寫着天下太平和五穀豐登等字樣，插在龍的背上，多麽有趣呀。那條藕在中秋晚上大家都没有吃，不過是供了一夜月亮，一直到第二天早晨，才給時敏偷偷的吃了。</p>
<p>這一天時敏没有讀書，從早上一直到黄昏，因爲父親給人家請去做「公卿」（註）去了，照例要很遲才得回來。他一個人在園子裏捉着一隻大的蚱蜢，雖然那蚱蜢吐了好些黄水在他的手上，可是他他很高興。他從後面的邊門進來，走到後廳，偷偷的將蚱蜢放在正在繡花的姑媽的勁上，嚇得她大聲喊呌的跳起來。於是時敏便大笑起來，勝利的跑了。他在園子裏又孤獨的玩了很久，回到屋子裏的時候，父親巳經回來了。</p>
<p>很奇怪的，屋子裏圍了好些人，都是從村裏來的。其中有些是時敏認得的，連那次給家裏帮忙割稻子的重陽老伯伯也在那兒。還有一些面孔都是很熟的，可是都呌不出名字來。在他們臉上，誰都很興奮，不知道爲什麽原故，好像是出了什麽亂子似的。在他們中間，圍着時敏的父親在讀報紙：連母親也在一旁聽得十分出神。時敏也自别人的肋下鑽了進出，很想從報紙上去看看有自己所歡喜的圖畫。不知道是誰拉了一下他的小辯子，怪討厭的，他回轉頭來看見一個不認識的面孔在向他發笑，他睜着眼晴，用力用癟了一下嘴，表示着他的憤怒，可是那個人更加笑得利害，眞是没有辦法的事。唯一的方法，祗有不理睬他，仍然從爸爸的肩頭上望過去，看着父親在讀報上的每一個字。這時候，聽見重陽老在說：武昌起義光復中華的故事：</p>
<p>「這樣一來那些滿洲人還有什麽呢？你們看罷，一定是革命黨的天下。」</p>
<p>「那也不一定的，你知道革命黨的，人馬少呀。」</p>
<p>這個說話的人是誰，時敏是不認得的。不過一會兒也就没有人再說話了，大家又靜聽着父親讀着報說：</p>
<p>「鄂垣節前卽傳革黨起事。初定十六日，因嚴防未得遂。旋改十八日，又爲密探知悉，捕獲革黨二十餘人，起出炸藥數十箱。十九日卽約同新軍倉卒起事，城中兵單遂失守。」</p>
<p>旭齋說到這裏，便揑着手指算：</p>
<p>「十九，二十，二十一，二十二，……今天二十幾呀？」</p>
<p>「今天二十六了。」這是灰雞母的聲音，不知是什麽時候來了的。</p>

        <h1>1934.09.13</h1>
<h3>The Far East After the Soviet Union Joins the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has joined the League of Nations, becoming one of its permanent members. This has already been approved by the General Assembly, and the telegram inviting them to join is being drafted for dispatch. If there are no changes in reality, this is truly a major shift in the international landscape. The chaotic situation in Europe, due to the discord between Germany, France, and Italy, and the instability of the situation in Central European small countries, has been a nightmare, leading to a standstill in the League of Nations' conference diplomacy. After the conference diplomacy stalled, secret diplomacy, characterized by intricate maneuvers, rose to take its place, reverting to the situation before 1914, and the complex situation became even more severe. The most important relationship in this is Germany's. Since Germany cannot abrogate the Treaty of Versailles and cannot directly annex Austria, the only way out is to compete with the Soviet Union eastward.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union had already planned a way to defend itself. The Soviet Union also knew that the so-called world revolution, developing westward, is difficult to realize today. Its own construction has entered the right track, and it will never be willing to destroy it lightly. Therefore, it first engaged in cordial relations with Italy, followed by an understanding with France. At the same time, France was suffering from the centrifugal movement of Central European countries, fearing that its hegemony would be shaken, so it urgently sought ways to recover and remedy the situation. The most beneficial way to do this was to revitalize the declining League of Nations and use the power of conferences to force Germany to submit to its framework. At this time, the Soviet Union also wanted to use its diplomacy to contain Germany's provocation of chaos, naturally sharing the same feelings with France. This is why it resolutely joined the League.</p>
<p>After the Soviet Union joined the League, European international relations were reorganized. Although Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it does not dare to disregard all interests and become an enemy of the whole of Europe. In Europe, it may be possible to maintain a temporary peace from now on. But what about the Far East? Japan is a powerful country that withdrew from the League of Nations. The main reason for its withdrawal was the dispute over the Northeast issue. The direct conflict of this issue is with China, and the indirect conflict is with the Soviet Union. Now, the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union has become direct and is becoming increasingly acute. The Soviet Union initially wanted to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to exchange for temporary peace in the Far East. However, Japan used its agile diplomatic skills, on the one hand, letting its puppets come forward and deliberately argue about prices, and on the other hand, maneuvering tortuously, making Soviet diplomacy fall into an impossible situation. Now that its relations with Europe have improved, it can naturally look westward without worry and will use all its strength to deal with the Far East. This is the situation that can be predicted.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's national defense originally focused on Europe because the relations in Central Europe were complex and the strongest opponent of the Soviet Union was Paris. Therefore, the western border was heavily guarded. Recently, the three small Baltic countries have extended their mutual non-aggression treaty for ten years, and have resumed normal relations with the Little Entente. With the realization of joining the League of Nations, it can now concentrate all its efforts on Far Eastern defense. Furthermore, after joining the League, the Soviet Union has obviously obtained the support of France in diplomacy. Its relations with European countries will not be as isolated as before. A new path for consultation will also be opened between Britain and the Soviet Union. If this phenomenon expands to Asia, the opposition between Britain and the Soviet Union can also be reduced, and the opportunity for a British-Japanese alliance may be reduced as a result. Therefore, if the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is successful, it has already gained a favorable position in the Far East. Japan therefore attaches great importance to it.</p>
<p>Recovery Area</p>
<p>Solution to Land Issues</p>
<p>Two Regulations Stipulated by the Military Headquarters</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The military headquarters has resolved the land issues in the recovered bandit areas and stipulated two regulations: (1) All agricultural products from the recovered bandit areas this year, whether they are official lands or private lands, except for those cultivated by the army, will belong to the cultivators of this year, and the original owners shall not demand rent; (2) From the second year after recovery, whether they are official lands or private lands, public or private owners can collect rent. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Central Political Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Conference held its 425th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th. Those present included Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Lin Sen, Chen Lifu, Dai Chuanxian, Kong Xiangxi, Shi Ying, Shi Qingyang, Zhu Jiqing, Li Zonghuang, and more than twenty others. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. The following important cases were resolved: (1) The deadline for the final completion of the treasury revenue and expenditure for the years before the 22nd fiscal year is extended to October 31st of this year, and the conclusion will be implemented immediately after the deadline. (2) The regulations of the Maritime Dispute Resolution Committee, sent by the Executive Yuan, are temporarily approved for record. (3) Eighteen draft budget proposals are approved.

<p>The False Government in Ruijin is Shaken</p>
<p>Bandits North of Shicheng are Defeated</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The false 35th Army Corps, the false 3rd Division, the 4th Division, the 13th Division, and the 15th Division of the bandits who remained in Jiangxi to guard their nests were completely defeated by the Three Route Army north of Shicheng. It is now possible to cross Shicheng and attack Ruijin, and the false government is shaken. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) After the various columns of □□□ completely defeated the false 35th Army Corps, the 40th Division, the 50th Division, and the 35th Division when they captured Yi Qian, they have now completed the blockade and transportation works and are following up and advancing southward. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>After Joint Suppression in Fujian and Zhejiang</p>
<p>The Fang Bandits Have Lost More Than Half</p>
<p>The Fang Bandits are Likely in Critical Condition Due to Heatstroke</p>
<p>The Bandit Masses Have Lost Their Center</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) After the remnant masses of the false 19th and 20th Army Corps, led by the Fang Bandit Zhimin, were jointly suppressed by our Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, they have indeed lost more than half. The bandits retreating along the border of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi are only five or six hundred people. They were ambushed again in the area of Qiaopu, Shangxia Yang, Suichang, and the bandits were greatly routed. The Fang Bandit is likely in critical condition due to heatstroke, and the bandit masses have lost their center and have recently been hiding in the mountains. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Lianjiang local communist Wei Geng's unit is sheltering the wounded bandits from the Fang bandits' unit. The province has dispatched troops to suppress them in order to annihilate them. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) According to a person who came from Liancheng on the 9th, there was a bandit attack in Pengkou Xizhongwu Village two to three days ago, but there have been no battles since then. They are now focusing on blockade and road construction. The general attack on Ting still needs to wait. Shicheng has not yet fallen. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>The Xiao Bandits Fled to the Mountains</p>
<p>Traffic in the Entire Guilin County Has Been Restored</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Liao Lei telegraphed on the 5th that the Xiao bandits secretly crossed the Xiang River near Xianshui on the evening of the 4th. On the morning of the 5th, our □ regiment rushed to the scene and engaged the bandits in a battle in Lutian. The bandits fled to the mountains in the northwest. The □□□ division is following up and also telegraphed He Jian in Hunan to send troops to block them. A follow-up telegram on the 6th stated that the □ regiment seized a bandit order on the 6th and learned that the bandits were fleeing westward, bordering Hunan and Guangxi. Currently, there are no bandit traces in the entire Guilin, Xing'an, and Guanyang counties. Traffic from Guilin to the entire county was restored to its original state on the 6th. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Statement by Captured Bandit Li Jian</p>
<p>Thoughts After Being Captured</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Li Jian, the head of the organization section of the political department of the false 4th Division of the 3rd Army Corps, stated his thoughts after being captured: (1) When the former bandit army occupied Guangchang Baishui, I went to Guangchang Baishui. At that time, the market was deserted, the population was sparse, and the desolation was unbearable to witness. This time I was captured and passed through Baishui Guangchang. I saw that the market had recovered and prospered, and the population had increased sharply. In just a few months, I visited the old place twice, and I had a great feeling of the past and present. Recalling that the bandit army advocated rural construction and economic construction, what was the result? It is truly a world apart from the area where the National Army is located. (2) I joined the Red Army in 1920 and suffered all kinds of hardships for four years. Today, the result I have obtained is a sickly appearance, a malnourished complexion, and clothes that do not cover my body, and my life is in danger. Even if I were not captured this time, it would be difficult to escape in the future. I truly regret not doing so in the first place. (3) When I was in the bandit army, I heard from political commissars at all levels that the National Army would slaughter all surrendered and captured bandit soldiers. I was very apprehensive when I was captured this time. However, the National Army was not hostile at all and treated me favorably. I realized that all levels of bandit political commissars used deception as a means, which I deeply hate. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>Directors of Unified Tax Bureaus of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan</p>
<p>Arrived in Nanjing to Discuss Two Matters</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ning Encheng, the director of the unified tax bureaus of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces, met with Minister of Finance Kong. According to the discussion, there are two tasks for this trip: (1) The issue of establishing inspection stations at various passes of the Great Wall. Four inspection stations have now been established at Shanhaiguan, Lengkou, Xifengkou, and Malanyu to inspect various imported goods, among which the import of cigarettes is the most. The tax collection method stipulates that those with a value of less than 300 yuan will be taxed 80 yuan, and those with a value of more than 300 yuan will be taxed 160 yuan. This matter is handled under the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, and this trip is to report the establishment process to the Ministry of Finance. (2) The issue of mining tax. Because the government is reorganizing mining tax, it has established methods to collect 5%. The bureau is contacting the mining authorities of the four provinces to carry out this work. At the same time, the Kailuan Coal Mine in North China is the largest, so we first cooperated with the mine to negotiate and have resolved the issue. The other mines, such as Changcheng, Liujiang, Jingxing, Zhenghua, Yijiang, Yihe, and Lincheng, are in progress. Because Kailuan has been resolved, there is an example to follow, and the progress has reached a considerable degree. It is estimated that all of them can be resolved in one or two months. The unified tax revenue of the four provinces is about 11 million yuan per year. In addition to allocating 500,000 yuan per month to repay the 20 million yuan patriotic bonds issued by the government during the 9/18 incident, there is still a surplus of 5 million yuan per year, which will be handed over to the national treasury.

<p>The US Labor Strike Situation Worsens</p>
<p>Riots and Bloodshed Occur</p>
<p>National Guard Mobilized to Assist Police in Maintaining Order</p>
<p>The Strike Threatens to Extend Indefinitely</p>
<p>Sellersville, Rhode Island The labor strike here became increasingly serious today. Fierce battles broke out around the cotton mills, injuring 142 people, including 18 police officers. Although the cotton mills were protected by a large number of police, the crowds gathered in increasing numbers, eventually surging forward, breaking through the sentry line, and pushing down the factory gates. 360 soldiers and police officers were beaten by the crowds. The rioters even attempted to set fire to and destroy the factory. Fortunately, 300 artillerymen arrived at the factory in an emergency, and the crowds, seeing that they were no match, retreated. All the soldiers and police officers had orders not to fire under any circumstances, so they only used batons and tear gas to resist the rioters. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Sellersville, Rhode Island Demonstrations and riots by strikers today resulted in three people being shot and injured by the police, including one woman. The strikers, disregarding warnings, gathered a large number of people and rushed to a factory to destroy the small room occupied by the gatekeepers. Although the police used batons to disperse them many times, they scattered and gathered again until firearms were used, and the crowds dispersed. The police claimed that they fired only for self-defense, as they could not have broken the siege otherwise and would have been subdued by the rioters. Since this case occurred, the strikers have been very angry. There are now 2,000 police officers stationed at the factory to prevent the strikers from continuing their attacks. Another 200 National Guard troops have been urgently summoned to assist the police in maintaining order. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American Federation of Labor announced that it will provide economic assistance to striking workers. Therefore, the textile workers' strike seems likely to extend indefinitely tonight.

If each person donates $5, there will be $20 million. At 6:00 PM tonight, Textile Workers Union Vice President Gorman stated that since the capitalists have rejected the union's public proposals, the labor side will not be responsible for any riots that may occur in the future. Therefore, the situation is worsening. Gorman issued an urgent plea today, requesting the capitalists to accept a "temporary ceasefire" before 6:00 PM, that is, all factories temporarily stop work and wait for a public judgment. Now, riots have occurred in various places, and workers have clashed with soldiers and police, injuring many people. Factories in various places are protected by the National Guard. In North Carolina, 19 factories resumed work yesterday under the protection of the military. (National Telegram on the 11th)</p>

<p>Japan Reforming Governance Organs in Manchuria</p>
<p>Opposing Okada's Compromise Proposal</p>
<p>The Kwantung Agency Prepares for Mass Resignation</p>
<p>The Fate of the Colonial Affairs Ministry Becomes a Question</p>
<p>The Military Negotiates with the Government</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Lushun, regarding the reform of the governance organs in Manchuria, the government's compromise proposal completely disregards the Colonial Affairs Ministry's original plan. Therefore, the 15,000 staff members of the Kwantung Agency system, which maintains the Colonial Affairs Ministry's plan, from bureau chiefs to servants, have decided to resign en masse. Currently, they are collecting letters of resignation. The Colonial Affairs Ministry itself, which had previously been silent and attached importance to this matter, was greatly stimulated after receiving this letter. A part of it had already been shaken, and as a result, the entire ministry will be greatly shaken. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada is convinced that the government's private proposal regarding the reform of the governance organs in Manchuria was determined after exchanging opinions with the authorities concerned. Therefore, there is no room for major changes in this private proposal. The content of the private proposal is based on the army's plan, and the outer form adopts the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' plan. It is the best plan. Therefore, although the Colonial Affairs Ministry's plan is sacrificed, Prime Minister Okada, who also concurrently serves as the Colonial Affairs Minister, is confident that he can make them understand. Another meeting of the related cabinet members will be held in two or three days, and it will definitely be resolved satisfactorily. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although it is expected that there will be twists and turns in the Japanese government's reform of the governing organs in Manchuria, it seems that the reform will eventually be implemented. At that time, all the powers of the Colonial Affairs Ministry over Manchuria (except for colonial affairs) will be eliminated. The rest will only govern the Governor-Generals and Chiefs of Taiwan, Korea, and Sakhalin. The amount of affairs will be drastically reduced, and it could be abolished. However, if the colonial rice control issue occurs, there must be a Colonial Affairs Minister to contact the central government, and if it is abolished temporarily, it is feared that it will arouse opposition from all the officials of the ministry. Therefore, the leaders of the current government have decided only to reform its organization, but the timing must wait for an appropriate opportunity. (Hualian dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the government's compromise proposal for the reform of the resident organs in Manchuria, the Army Ministry has requested revisions to (1) the establishment of the status of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and the special official system regarding qualifications, and (2) the issue of the Manchuria Affairs Bureau under the management of the Prime Minister. Army Minister Hayashi met with Prime Minister Okada on the morning of the 12th and explained the army's opinions on this matter. (Nikkan News dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the reform of the resident organs in Manchuria, as a result of the meeting between Prime Minister Okada and Army Minister Hayashi on the morning of the 12th, there is a dawn of a satisfactory resolution. Regarding the future request from the army to supplement and correct the government's compromise proposal, the relevant authorities can conduct further negotiations. After determining the final plan, it is scheduled to be decided and endorsed at the regular cabinet meeting on the 14th. (Nikkan News dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Content of the Compromise Proposal</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the reform of the resident organs in Manchuria, the content of the compromise proposal still in the hands of Prime Minister Okada is as follows: (1) The Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary resident in Manchuria is a purely diplomatic official, concurrently held by the commander of the Kwantung Army, and is under the orders of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. (1) The Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary is granted administrative supervisory power, which is stipulated by single-line imperial decrees. This supervisory power belongs to the Prime Minister's command system. (1) Under the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, a counselor is appointed to handle diplomatic affairs, and at the same time, an administrative affairs director-general is appointed as an administrative official, who is under the command system of the Prime Minister through the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. The Governor of Kwantung Prefecture and the ministers appointed by imperial decree are under the command of the Prime Minister through the administrative affairs director-general of the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. (1) A Manchuria Affairs Bureau is established in the Cabinet, and the Manchuria Affairs Participation Conference is directly under the Prime Minister. (1) The Director-General of the Manchuria Affairs Bureau is, in principle, a civil official appointed as a personal office. (1) The Manchuria Affairs Participation Conference appoints the heads of the relevant ministries, including the Army, Foreign Affairs, Colonial Affairs, and Finance ministries. (1) The Colonial Affairs Minister conducts overseas colonial immigration matters through the consulates under the orders of the Foreign Minister. In addition, regarding the government's reform of the resident organs in Manchuria, in order to control the industrial economy of Japan and Manchukuo, a Japan-Manchukuo Economic Conference is established, stationed permanently in Changchun, and organized by the same kind of committee members appointed by the governments of the two countries. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Key Points of the Military's Claims</p>
<p>Army Commander Concurrently Serves as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army convened a meeting of its leaders at 9:00 PM last night regarding the government's compromise proposal for the reform of the resident organs in Manchuria. As a result of the negotiations, it was decided to revise the following points, which will be presented to Prime Minister Okada after obtaining the understanding of the non-official military councilors today. Namely, (1) As in the government's proposal, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary resident in Manchuria is the same as other general ambassadors, although he has the form of concurrently handling administrative matters. However, this does not conform to the reality of Manchuria. Therefore, a special official system should be established with the ambassador as the center, and administrative affairs should also be the natural powers of the ambassador. The ambassador should be the official agency for administrative diplomacy. (1) According to the government's proposal, the director of the Manchuria Affairs Bureau can be filled by the Colonial Affairs Minister. However, this is contrary to the actual requirements of Manchuria, making the reform of the resident organs in Manchuria meaningless. Therefore, it should be stipulated that the director cannot be filled by the Colonial Affairs Minister or the heads of the Colonial Affairs Ministry, but should be filled by an active-duty officer. That is, the director-general of affairs under the ambassador should also be filled by the chief of staff of the Kwantung Army or an active-duty officer. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army is quite dissatisfied with the government's proposal for the reform of the resident organs in Manchuria. The key points of the Army's claims are as follows: (1) The right to petition of the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary should be returned to the Army Minister. (2) It must be clearly stated that the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary is concurrently held by a military officer. (3) It must be clearly stated that the Director-General of the Manchuria Affairs Bureau is filled by a military officer. It is difficult to agree to the government's proposal that it should be filled by a civil official in principle. (4) The Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army should be appointed as the Director-General of Affairs. It is noteworthy that the Army's plan calls for the commander of the army to concurrently serve as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and have thorough and permanent power. If the government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs do not object to this request, a comprehensive solution may be obtained at the cabinet meeting on the 14th. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Proposes a Counterproposal</p>
<p>Arguing for Unified Command of the Police</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After yesterday's three-minister meeting on the reform of the resident organs in Manchuria ended, Foreign Minister Hirota convened a meeting of the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Although the government's proposal was generally approved, there were still dissatisfactions regarding detailed matters such as police unification. Therefore, a counterproposal was made and presented to Prime Minister Okada on the 12th. That is, the government's proposal places the command and supervision of consular police and affiliated police under the ambassador, while the command system of the former belongs to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the latter belongs to the Prime Minister. This lacks unity. In the future, the attached areas of the South Manchuria Railway must be returned, so the command and supervision of the two police forces should be unified under the Minister of Foreign Affairs and managed by the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In addition to advocating that this ambassador directly supervise the administrative police power of the South Manchuria Railway attached areas, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintains its attitude based on the following policies: (1) Respect the independence of Manchukuo. (2) The establishment of various policies must consider the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchukuo. (3) The current three-in-one system is a temporary measure. In the future, separate the three items of diplomacy, military affairs, and economy. Military and government officials should not concurrently serve as the ambassador resident in Manchuria. (Nikkan News dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Eliminating Powers in Manchuria</p>
<p>The Colonial Affairs Ministry Expresses Absolute Opposition</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because its powers in Manchuria are almost completely eliminated, the Colonial Affairs Ministry absolutely opposes the compromise proposal. Therefore, how Prime Minister Okada's proposed compromise proposal will turn out cannot be predicted. (Nikkan News dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>Strict Prohibition of Gambling in Fuzhou</p>
<p>Flower Association Gambling Dens Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Government, in order to strictly prohibit Taiwanese from running flower associations, issued a proclamation yesterday stating: "The operation of flower associations has long been strictly prohibited. In the past, the main offenders were severely punished. However, over time, people have become lax, and recently, unscrupulous individuals in Fuzhou City have disregarded the ban and secretly operated these associations. Ignorant and foolish people pursue and gamble on them, recklessly breaking the law, which is heartbreaking. Recently, the Nanchang Headquarters has approved the Regulations on Punishing Special Types of Gambling in this province, which this government has promulgated and made known. Flower associations are one of the special types of gambling, and the penalties are very severe, ranging from imprisonment to execution. Heavy penalties are used to restore order and reverse the declining trend. Considering that we are all citizens, we should seek legitimate occupations. Gaining temporary small profits leads to inescapable legal consequences, which is punishable and pitiable. Therefore, this proclamation is re-emphasized. Everyone must repent, immediately close down the associations, and seek legitimate employment to avoid criminal charges. If they continue to be stubborn and regard the ban as a mere formality, this chairman will order the enforcement agencies to punish them according to the law without any leniency. As for military, police, and civil servants who harbor such activities, they will also be punished to the fullest extent according to the regulations." Regarding the Public Security Bureau, from the 3rd to the 5th, the police and detectives arrested more than 50 Chinese partners in various foreign card flower association gambling dens. The authorities now plan to transfer those with serious offenses to the Military Law Section of the Security Office for trial, while those with minor offenses will be dealt with by the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau. The number of flower association gambling dens in the city has decreased from more than 30 to 4 as of the 5th. However, there are very few gamblers, making it difficult for the dens to survive. As a result, the Taiwanese vagrants have become extremely resentful of the police and detectives. For days, they have been in groups of three or five, carrying pistols and bayonets, provoking and committing violence in Nandaomen and Ximen Street. However, the authorities have made great efforts to prevent this from happening. (6th)</p>

After receiving the order, the Second District Commissioner Wang Zhuren yesterday issued orders to the county magistrates under his jurisdiction to follow the quotas.

<p>Confucian Clan Representatives Suggest</p>
<p>Building a Museum and Library in Qufu</p>
<p>To Display Ancient Carriages, Clothing, and Ritual Objects</p>
<p>And Reprinting the Confucian Mansion's Collection</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In order to honor Confucius, the Central Government has issued an order nationwide to hold commemorative conferences on Confucius's birthday. Ye Chucang was also dispatched to Qufu to preside over the ceremonies. The grandeur of the ceremonies was unprecedented. From the provincial side, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs Li Shuchun and the Director of the Department of Education He Siyuan also went to participate in the Confucius memorial ceremony. While in Qufu, they saw that the Kuiwen Pavilion of the Confucius Temple was damaged and many musical instruments were in disrepair. After returning to Jinan, they proposed at the provincial government's political affairs meeting to repair the Kuiwen Pavilion of the Confucius Temple, display all kinds of carriages, clothing, and ritual objects, and repair ancient musical instruments. After the two proposals were passed, they are now being prepared for implementation. The Confucian clansmen of Qufu specially dispatched Kong Fanzheng and Kong Lingcan to Jinan to express their gratitude and discuss the preservation of ancient documents. According to the Confucian clan's opinion, it is planned to build a museum to display carriages, clothing, ritual objects, etc., for the viewing of Chinese and foreign visitors to Qufu, and to build a library to display the ancient books collected in the Confucian Mansion. The plan coincides with the proposals passed by the provincial government. In addition, it is planned to organize and publish books. The ancient books stored in the Confucian Mansion that have already been engraved and printed were printed once during the Guangxu period of Sun Qing. The printing plates have been piled up for decades. It is now planned to reprint them. Many of the books have not been seen outside. There are also many musical scores. Kong Yunting, the author of the Peach Blossom Fan, wrote many books, and it is planned to engrave and print those that have not been printed. However, this kind of work is very expensive. According to the Confucian clan's opinion, it is planned to ask the provincial government to advance some funds. After the books are printed and sold, the proceeds will be used to repay the provincial government. The Director of the Provincial Library, Wang Xiantang, strongly supports this matter because it is related to the circulation of ancient books. He is currently in contact with them, and it is possible that it will be realized.</p>
<p>In addition, the Confucian clan genealogy has not been revised for many years. Because there are many branches of the clan, the work is not easy. Recently, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi advocated for the resumption of the revision, and the Kong clan can donate 100,000 yuan to help it succeed. According to calculations, the required funds are no less than 200,000, which is almost there. As soon as the preparations are complete, the revision will begin. (11th)</p>
<p>Anhui Province Relief Committee</p>
<p>Requests Allocation of Agricultural Relief Funds to Farmers</p>
<p>—To Provide Funds for Planting After the Disaster—</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The drought in Anhui Province this year is severe, many times worse than the flood of 1931. The Provincial Disaster Relief Committee plans to allocate all the funds, including principal and interest, totaling more than 1 million yuan, that were previously allocated to Anhui Province for American wheat by the National Government Flood Relief Committee, back to farmers to provide funds for planting after the disaster. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to the Provincial Government, requesting that it telegraph the National Economic Council to order it to do so in order to provide relief. The original letter is as follows: "Regarding the previous suggestion from this committee to your government to request that the funds from the China International Famine Relief Commission for agricultural relief in Anhui Province be allocated in full, or to specially borrow 300,000 yuan to repair the breached dikes, letters and telegrams have been exchanged, but the allocation has not yet been made. This is because the drought in our province this year is even more severe than the floods of previous years. The disaster area covers as many as 48 counties, with tens of millions of disaster victims. Not only is their current livelihood cut off, but also the seeds for planting after this autumn are nowhere to be found. This is not only related to local production, but also to local safety. Looking ahead, we cannot help but shudder. Therefore, it has been jointly decided to suggest that the more than 1 million yuan, including the wheat price and interest, of the 11,800 tons of American wheat previously allocated to Anhui Province by the National Government Flood Relief Committee and stored by the China International Famine Relief Commission should be allocated to the farmers for planting after the disaster. This is not inconsistent with the original agricultural relief plan. It seems reasonable to use the original funds for relieving the farmers of Anhui to continue to relieve the farmers of Anhui. However, the autumn is coming soon, and the matter is urgent. Therefore, we specially request that you investigate and promptly telegraph the National Economic Council to order the China International Famine Relief Commission to quickly allocate the principal and interest of more than 1 million yuan of the aforementioned agricultural relief funds back to our province for relief, which is immeasurably anticipated."

<p>Zhejiang Province's Telecommunications Network Fully Completed</p>
<p>Long-distance Trunk and Branch Lines Total 4,500 Kilometers</p>
<p>A Total of 59 Long-distance Branch Offices in the Province</p>
<p>In addition to building railways and highways, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has also been keen on building a telecommunications network in recent years. Under the supervision of Director of the Department of Construction Zeng Yangfu and the diligent management of Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau Zhao Zengjue, the province's long-distance telecommunications network is now accessible in all directions, spreading throughout the counties, making it the best in the country. The long-distance telephone lines originally laid in Zhejiang Province were mainly for communicating military information, so they were mostly hung on telegraph poles. The engineering was simple. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, the Department of Construction drafted a basic plan for long-distance telephones. In March 1928, the Zhejiang Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Bureau was established. All facilities were carried out according to the basic plan, dividing the province into eight major trunk lines. In addition to the trunk lines, there are branch lines, village lines, and border defense lines. Now, 4,500 kilometers of long-distance trunk and branch lines, 1,270 kilometers of village lines, and 550 kilometers of border defense lines have been completed. The points reached by the trunk and branch lines are all designated as central points. The current central points are Hangzhou, Lanxi, Yongjia, Linhai, Ningbo, Jiaxing, Lishui, and other exchange centers in seven locations. The centers are all connected by direct lines. Of the 75 counties in the province, all except Dinghai and Nantian have telephone service. Dinghai and Nantian are isolated in the sea, and water lines are currently being planned. However, Dinghai already has a radio station for reporting, and Nantian is also planning to set up a radio station to remedy the situation. All trunk lines are made of copper, and the standards are very strict, so the transmission is very clear. Currently, there are a total of 59 long-distance branch offices and 185 long-distance agency offices in the province. News between the counties can be transmitted throughout the province in an instant, which is very convenient. Now that the Southeast Transportation Exhibition is about to open, the Telephone Bureau is also planning various telecommunications in the scenic areas, which will make communication even smoother. However, the basic project is the long-distance telephone service in 73 counties. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Hangzhou-Changxing Line: From Hangzhou through Wukang, Wuxing, and Changxing to the Jiangsu Province border, the total length is 167.62 kilometers, with four branch lines: (1) Wukang-Mogan Branch Line: From Wukang to Mogan Mountain, the total length is 14.40 kilometers.

<p>Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau</p>
<p>Plans to Repair the Yellow River Railway Bridge</p>
<p>Railway Revenue Exceeds 300,000 per Month, Reserves for Construction</p>
<p>Decided on Reorganization Steps, Pay Attention to Driving Safety</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The news of the Beijing-Hankou Railway borrowing funds and expanding has attracted much attention from all walks of life. Here are the details: The Beijing-Hankou Railway has been affected by military operations for many years, and the sleepers, bridges, and rails have been severely damaged and urgently need repair and replacement. However, due to limited finances, it has been difficult to achieve this. In recent years, the bureau has implemented reorganization in both material and spiritual ways, within the possible scope, sweeping away the old habits of the past and engaging in thrift. It is estimated that more than 300,000 yuan can be saved each month, stored monthly to finance construction, and progress is made step by step according to the urgency of the project. It is expected that the entire railway can be restored to its complete state in seven years. It is now planned to use the more than 3 million yuan saved each year to reorganize the equipment of locomotives and vehicles.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, due to the influence of the environment, there are many outstanding debts that also need to be repaid. However, with this deposit of more than 3 million yuan per year, it is expected that the miscellaneous debts can be cleared in two or three years. There are also considerable measures for opening up revenue sources, and future construction can be carried out more actively. As for its reorganization steps: (1) Pay attention to driving safety; (2) Strive to increase efficiency; (3) Regarding the comfort of passengers and the equipment of stations along the line, especially the repair of the Yellow River Railway Bridge, which is urgent, because the bridge foundation is already too loose to be used. It has been decided to start construction this year.</p>
<p>Regarding the rumor that the Beijing-Hankou Railway borrowed 30 million yuan, according to Chen Yanjiong and Zou Anzhong of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, not only did the Ministry of Railways and this railway have no such intention, but there was no so-called contract signed. It is unknown where this statement came from. Such rumors are absolutely untrue. (Shenshi News Agency)</p>
<p>Shanxi Province Strictly Prevents Shaanxi Bandits</p>
<p>Shilou and Linxian Counties Send Urgent Telegraphs to Warn</p>
<p>The Pacification Headquarters Dispatches Troops to Block and Attack</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The bandits in the counties along the river in eastern Shaanxi have been incited by the bandit leader Wang Ermei and have become increasingly rampant in recent times. Branches have been set up in all counties and villages, coercing villagers to commit evil together. If they do not obey, they will be brutally killed. The people of eastern Shaanxi are suffering from trampling, and hundreds of people flee across the river to Shanxi every day to seek refuge. The authorities in the counties of western Shanxi are afraid that the bandits may sneak in and carry out activities in Shanxi, so they are strictly inspecting at the ferry crossings, only allowing women and children to land. All adult men who are suspicious are refused entry. However, because the people of eastern Shaanxi have either been drawn into bandit lairs, or been brutally killed, or have fled with their young and old, the source of supplies has been cut off. Therefore, there is an attempt to cross the river to the east and plunder in Shanxi. According to the report from Li Shude, the magistrate of Shilou County, on the 3rd of this month, the Shaanxi bandits are close to the riverbank, building protective works to cross the river, and dozens of bandits have crossed the river by boat. Although they were repelled by our army, they are still lurking in the nearby mountains, ready to make trouble. The magistrate of Linxian County also reported that more than a dozen villages, including Qianzhuang, in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, across the river, have been occupied by the bandit leader Liu Zishan, leading four to five hundred bandits, separated from western Shanxi by only one river. The provincial defense is crucial, and it is urgent to find a way to prevent it. After receiving the telegram, the provincial authorities, in addition to telegraphing the Suiyuan Garrison to dispatch the Cai Regiment of the 71st Division, which was building a car road in Yangmingbao, to block them, the provincial government also telegraphed the magistrates of Pianguan, Hequ, Baode, Xingxian, Lanshi, Zhongyang, Yonghe, Daning, Jixian, and Xiangning counties along the river today to cooperate with the military and police to strictly prevent them.

<p>Recent News on the Repair of the Seawall in Songjiang</p>
<p>The Department of Construction believes that the seawalls in the three counties of Jiangnan, Taicang, Baoshan, and Songjiang are gradually collapsing and urgently need to be repaired. Therefore, it allocated more than 500,000 yuan in construction costs and dispatched engineer Chen Shoulian to supervise the repairs. On the one hand, it hired elders from each county as supervisors to supervise the work. The seawall in this county was repaired by Bureau of Construction Director Xu Baikui in 1926 after requesting funds. It was built with cement, but the embankment surface was filled with gravel, causing water leakage and accumulation, which easily damaged the embankment body. This time, the Jinshanwei area will repair three sections of the project, which will cost more than 70,000 yuan. Shen Siqi and Min Ruizhi were hired as supervisors, and Wu Boyang and Zhou Mengxiong were hired as assistant supervisors. At the end of last month, a section chief of the Department of Construction, together with supervisors Zhu Kaipan, Chou Hongjing, and Ping, personally inspected the Jinshanwei seawall construction site. At the beginning of the month, assistant supervisors Wu Boyang and Zhou Mengxiong accompanied engineer Chen to inspect the area. The first and second sections of the project have been completed, and the third section of the embankment surface is currently under construction. On the afternoon of the 10th, they went to No. 70 Renji Road, Shanghai, to hold a supervisors' meeting. Taicang members Zhu and Hong, Baoshan members Jin and Zhao, and Songjiang Shen Siqi and Wu Boyang attended. They all believed that the drawback of this embankment was that the subcontracting did not conform to the detailed rules for material handling, and the sloppiness of the project was secondary. It was decided to have Shen Siqi draft a letter to urge the Director of the Department of Construction to pay attention.</p>

<p>County Government Burns Opium</p>
<p>The county government has approved the burning of 133 pieces of confiscated opium tools, opium soil, and drugs accumulated during the tenure of the previous magistrate Kong, and 129 pieces during the current tenure, for a total of more than ten wooden boxes. The Jiangsu Higher Court approved the burning and dispatched Shanghai County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia to Nanhui to supervise. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the county ordered officials to take the sealed wooden boxes out of the warehouse and place them in front of the hall. They were opened and inspected in public. There were more than 70 packages of opium soil, one large bottle of morphine, and opium tools. After taking photos, they were poured onto a pile of firewood, poured with kerosene, and set on fire.</p>

Mr. Sun and the crowd boarded the Yuebao small steamship and arrived at the new Customs Wharf at around 8:00 AM. He immediately boarded his car and returned to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. Mr. Sun brought back many Honolulu dance wreaths from Honolulu and gave them to the welcoming staff. Therefore, both men and women were wearing a wreath, which was quite interesting.</p>
<p>Meeting with the US President</p>
<p>Mr. Sun told reporters in the cabin that he had taken advantage of the Legislative Yuan's recess to go to Honolulu with his family to escape the summer heat. Now that the hot summer has passed, he is returning by boat. After a short stay in Shanghai, he will take the night train to Nanjing on the 13th to preside over the first meeting of the Legislative Yuan after the recess on the 14th. The constitutional issue will not be discussed at the meeting. During his stay in Honolulu, he met with US President Roosevelt in passing, but it was purely an ordinary meeting and did not involve any political issues.</p>
<p>International Situation</p>
<p>According to various reports, the relationship between Japan and the United States has become more tense due to the tension between Japan and Russia. Mr. Sun said that during his month-long stay in Honolulu, he did not see any changes in the relationship between Japan and the United States. However, when traveling back and forth through Japan, he only knew that the Japanese authorities were very active in preparing for military affairs, especially air defense equipment. However, according to his observations, any country is now actively preparing for air defense, but it is difficult to say whether its air defense equipment will be as effective as desired once war breaks out in the future. As for the issue between Japan and Russia, although the situation between the two countries is tense, the sale of the Middle East Road seems to have broken down, but it is expected that the war will not break out immediately because of this. Furthermore, although the negotiations on the Middle East Road are on the verge of collapse, the authorities of both countries still hope to delay the outbreak of war with the issue of the Middle East Road. The 15th session of the League of Nations has now opened. It is firmly believed that the League of Nations will still adhere to its original position on the issue of the puppet organization and will always deny it. As for the British industrial inspection team's visit to Northeast China, the team was organized by British businessmen and not by the British government. It is based on the principle of "smelling meat but not eating it." As for the Anglo-Japanese alliance and the conclusion of secret agreements, it is also the air that the Japanese side is eager to release. Although the rumors are rife, the United Kingdom has not had this intention so far.</p>
<p>US Economy</p>
<p>Mr. Sun continued to answer reporters' questions. Although he was not in Honolulu for a long time, he felt that although the United States was said to be better on the surface after the implementation of the recovery policy, in reality, there was no real improvement, and he felt that its difficulties were increasing at any time, such as the great drought and strikes. Under these circumstances, the advantages and disadvantages of the recovery policy in the trial run are still difficult to predict. At present, 25 out of 100 people in the United States rely on the government to maintain their lives. This alone can prove that the trial run of the US recovery policy has not achieved considerable results. As for the United States raising the price of silver and nationalizing silver, it is a policy of currency inflation. Silver is nationalized at 50.001 cents per ounce, but on the one hand, it is used as a reserve for issuing 1.20 yuan of banknotes per ounce, which proves that it is a currency inflation policy. At the same time, due to the United States raising the price of silver, speculators buy silver and export it for profit, which is of course a major disadvantage to our country's finances.</p>
<p>Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Regarding the Central Government's preparations for the Fifth National Congress, Mr. Sun said that he had just arrived in the country and was not aware of the details, but he said that the opening of the Fifth National Congress will definitely not be extended any longer, which can be asserted. If the Southwest has proposals and legitimate reasons to state, they can be submitted to the Congress. The reason is that the Fifth National Congress cannot be opposed by anyone, which is very clear. Mr. Sun also said that he had not prepared for the proposals to the Congress because the opening date was still far away.</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Trip to Nanjing is Pending</p>
<p>He Will Leave Shanghai Around the 16th</p>
<p>Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, has been in Shanghai for several days, contacting various parties and is extremely busy. According to sources close to Huang Fu yesterday, Mr. Huang still has several days to stay in Shanghai and will go to Nanjing around the 16th to meet with Wang. After staying for a short time, he will return to the north to take up his duties.</p>
<p>Gu Weijun</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao Yesterday</p>
<p>Gu Weijun, the French Ambassador, returned to Shanghai after visiting Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi. He hurriedly took a plane to Qingdao to handle personal affairs. Now, Mr. Gu took the Taikoo Steamship Company's Shuntian to Shanghai at 5:30 PM yesterday because his wife had scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by boat from France within days. His elder brother Weixin and others welcomed him at the pier. Mr. Gu plans to return to his hometown with his wife after she arrives in Shanghai. The date of his return to his post has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Local Township Reports on Disaster Situation</p>
<p>Three Bureaus Will Jointly Investigate</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, this city has been affected by drought this year. Although the authorities have tried their best to provide relief, the farmland is still in poor harvest. Now that the autumn harvest is approaching, various townships have reported to the authorities that they have been affected by the disaster and asked for a reduction or exemption from taxes to alleviate the difficulties of the farmers. It is reported that the municipal authorities will first order the three bureaus of Finance, Land, and Society to jointly investigate the actual situation of the disaster, and then approve the measures for reducing or exempting land taxes.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Government Procures Zhejiang Rice</p>
<p>Transported to Hangzhou via Shanghai for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Various counties in Zhejiang Province have suffered from drought and famine. Chairman Lu Dipin has ordered the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs to appoint a special commissioner Xu Pan Yun to go to the counties of Wenzhou and Taizhou in the province to purchase grain. 1,056 bags of rice were purchased from Pingyang County, packed and transported to Shanghai on the Xin Ruiping steamship, and then reported to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Xie Da Xing Transport Company for loading. They were loaded from the Rihui Port Station and transported to Hangzhou. Another 1,500 bags of rice were purchased from Leqing County, loaded on the Yili steamship and transported to Shanghai. They are scheduled to be transported to Hangzhou by Xie Da Xing Company today and tomorrow to be distributed to various disaster-stricken counties to relieve the people.</p>
<p>Special Survey of Domestic Goods Industry</p>
<p>(5) Ink Industry</p>
<p>The ink industry is developing with the cultural industry. Since the introduction of printing, European-made ink has been imported along with it. At first, there was only black ink, and then various colored inks were imported, mostly from Germany and Japan. During the European War, the source of ink was suddenly cut off, and Chinese people rushed to set up ink factories to manufacture it themselves. However, except for the Commercial Press, most of them had too little capital, and their output was small and without significant achievements. In recent years, they have gradually developed, and larger factories include Yonghe Industrial, Tongwen, and Lingsheng. Recently, we visited Mr. Ye Jiting, the factory director of Yonghe Industrial Company, and Mr. Qian Mengwei, the director of the ink department. After the visit, we had a conversation, which is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Qian said that there are generally three types of machines for manufacturing ink: rolling mill, grinder, and mixer. The raw materials for ink are generally varnish and color powder. The most common color powder is ink ash, and the varnish is mostly made by frying sesame oil from Yajiakou. The manufacturing ingredients are tung oil, sesame oil, red oil (mineral oil), pigment powder, ink ash, rosin, magnesium carbonate, varnish, etc. The manufacturing is still simple. First, the oil is made into varnish, and then it is mixed with ink ash or pigment powder, and then it is put on the machine for repeated mixing. Generally, high-quality ink needs to be rolled 15 to 18 times. Ink is used for four types: copperplate ink, lithographic ink, offset ink, and mimeograph ink. There are eight or nine companies in the industry, including Yonghe Industrial, Tongwen, Lingsheng, Junda, Gongsheng, and Yihua. There is no organization of the same industry association. Some are called domestic goods factories, but in fact, they sell imported ink, change the name, and claim to be domestic goods, so as to gain huge profits. Users do not distinguish between true and false, and only covet cheap prices, which greatly affects domestic goods ink. At present, the annual sales volume of domestic products is only 600,000 yuan, while the survey shows that the annual demand for ink is 9 million yuan, accounting for only one-fifteenth. If domestic goods manufacturers can research cheap and high-quality ink, increase capital, and produce in large quantities, it is not difficult to compete with Japanese goods. In terms of raw materials, except for colors, oils can all be obtained without waiting for foreign demand. Mr. Qian is a chemical expert. Recently, he has overcome various difficulties, and the ink he produces has been comparable to imported products, and all parties are happy to use it. However, Japanese goods are being dumped more and more fiercely, and merchants are willing to be accomplices and fuel the flames. Domestic goods ink always feels squeezed everywhere. Although there are no factories that have failed recently, the interest is also very small. It is hoped that all factories will concentrate on researching the improvement of products and the reduction of costs, or they may be able to drive out foreign goods and compete with them. Otherwise, they will fight each other, or be willing to sell Japanese goods, and there will be no good results in the industry in the future. Yonghe Ink Factory was founded in the 17th year of the Republic of China with a capital of 100,000 yuan. It has oil-making workshops, pigment workshops, and ink-making workshops on Minsheng Road, West Baoxing Road, Zhabei. All of them are equipped with the latest machinery, and all management is completely scientific. The products include rubber car ink, lithographic ink, letterpress ink, three-color plate ink, and printing ink. Among the domestic goods ink factories in Shanghai, the equipment is the most complete, and the factory is the first to be able to use domestic self-made varnish and self-made dry pigments. Factory director Ye Jiting is a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Berlin, Germany. Director Qian Mengwei was the factory director of Sino-American Oil Factory. He has been studying pigments and ink with German Dr. Connisch for many years and has rich experience, so he can have this achievement. Mr. Qian said that the ink industry is not only related to culture and education, but also very helpful to industry. He is now uniting with his peers to cooperate thoroughly and strive for technological improvements, so as to defeat imported ink and recover this huge leak of 8.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Woman Tenant in Qinyu Lane</p>
<p>Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>Representatives of All Tenants</p>
<p>Petition the Rent Reduction Committee</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Qinyu Lane Rent Reduction Literary Society at the end of Yangshupu Road, all tenants, due to the difficulty of life, asked the landlord Qinyu Company to reduce the rent. Because it had not been resolved for a long time, the tenants owed rent for many months, and the landlord requested the court to attach it, resulting in many households being sealed. At 11:00 AM yesterday, a tenant named Zang Xun, 50 years old, from Changshu, was beaten severely and seriously injured due to the sealing of the door, arousing public outrage. The perpetrators were sent to the Yangshupu Police Station for punishment. The branch led all the tenants, one representative per household, a total of more than 100 people, hired two loading trucks, and went to the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee to petition. Members of the committee, such as Zhang Xianfang and Chen Jiufeng, came forward to meet with them. The representatives of the branch stated that they had been oppressed by the landlord, who had instigated hooligans to commit violence and beat the tenant Zang Gou, and demanded serious negotiations and full assistance.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Returning from Korea</p>
<p>Talk About the Japanese Restriction on Overseas Chinese Entering Korea</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Unanimously Oppose and Send a Telegram Requesting a Serious Protest</p>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, the reporter met with Mr. Zhang, an overseas Chinese who returned from Korea by the Fubo Maru the day before yesterday. According to him, there are no less than 90,000 overseas Chinese in Korea doing business. Most of them are working hard and abiding by the law, but they are still often treated harshly by the Japanese and Korean people, which has led to the increasingly deteriorating situation of overseas Chinese in Korea. However, overseas Chinese are forced by their livelihoods and have to endure their anger and get along peacefully. Who knows that the Japanese Governor-General suddenly announced the Chinese Immigration Law on September 1st, restricting overseas Chinese from going to Korea. According to the reasons held by the Japanese side, they believe that although the restriction measures for overseas Chinese entering Korea have been implemented for many years, the economic situation in China is becoming increasingly bad, which has led to a sharp increase in the number of unemployed people in the country, and the number of people moving to Korea has also increased year by year. Moreover, as the number of Chinese workers increases, Japanese and Korean workers will be greatly affected, and peace and order will be threatened by the increase in the number of unemployed people. Therefore, it is necessary to further strictly implement restriction measures to resist it. According to the regulations, there are a total of four articles. The main provisions are that all Chinese entering Korea must pay a deposit of 100 yen per day, and Chinese workers are absolutely prohibited from entering the country. It will be implemented from September 1st of this year, and all overseas Chinese currently in Korea will also be treated in the same way. However, those entering Korea from Manchuria are not subject to this rule. After the announcement of this order, the overseas Chinese in Korea unanimously expressed their indignation. In order to protect the safety of the overseas Chinese, they immediately convened a general meeting of all overseas Chinese in Korea at the Chinese Consulate General and the Overseas Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Korea to discuss countermeasures and decided on three points of opposition to this order: (1) The overseas Chinese believe that although the order is only issued for Chinese workers on the surface, its actual intention is to cut off the connection between all existing overseas Chinese and the motherland. (2) It is believed that this order has the suspicion of forcibly assimilating overseas Chinese. (3) China has never restricted the entry of any Japanese people, so it should not hinder the freedom of overseas Chinese in Korea. The above-mentioned reasons for opposition have been submitted to the Consul General in Seoul, Korea, to protest to the Japanese Governor, and a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country to report everything. Mr. Zhang finally said that our overseas Chinese compatriots are in a difficult situation under the current environment. It is hoped that the country and the compatriots in the country will pay attention to providing assistance.</p>

<p>Shanghai County Government Investigates and Reports on Disasters</p>
<p>The farmland in various districts of Shanghai County was affected by drought this summer. The county government has reported the situation to the provincial authorities. Now, the Department of Finance has issued instructions, promulgated disaster investigation and reporting methods, and stated that the autumn harvest this year should be investigated and reported by the county in a practical manner, and no procrastination or other irregularities are allowed. Severe penalties will be imposed. Also, the deadline for reporting disasters is September 15. After receiving the order, County Mayor Pan has ordered the district chiefs to report the disaster situation truthfully, and the county will send personnel to investigate, compile the case, and submit it to the Department of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction for separate investigation by members. It seems that the autumn harvest will be determined. However, it is reported that the autumn harvest in each district this year has been affected by the drought, and the county's average is at most 40-50%.</p>
<p>Monks Collect Donations for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The China Foreign Relief Association at 97 Renji Road recently received a letter from monks Yuanming and others in Jiangxi. They stated that the drought in Hukou and Pengze counties in Jiangxi was severe, and they were heartbroken by what they saw. They were willing to collect dozens of yuan from their scripture chanting income and send it to the association for disaster relief. Wandering monks have this compassion, which is admirable. The letter is excerpted as follows: (Omitted above) "Heaven has sent a strange disaster, suffering our compatriots. We have been to Hukou and Pengze counties and witnessed the crops withering and dying. The refugees are miserable. Yuanming and others asked if they had any surplus savings that could be used for disaster relief. They heard the words, wept bitterly, and replied, 'Hukou has a dense population and scarce land, originally a poor place. In addition, disasters have been frequent and agricultural production has been poor in recent years, making ends meet is difficult, and vitality is greatly damaged, reaching its limit. In addition, donations and taxes are heavy, and there is no room for delay. Pledges have been exhausted, and there is no way to borrow. As a result, some families have run out of food for several days and committed suicide. Now that the autumn harvest is hopeless, there is no way to make a living, and they are waiting to be fed.' After speaking, they wept bitterly. Yuanming and others saw this image and were very heartbroken. But as monks, they had no savings and had to donate all their scripture chanting income, and persuaded Monk Zexuan to donate 18.5 yuan, Monk Derong 5 yuan, and Monk Benxian 2.5 yuan. Together with their own savings, they sent it to your association and begged you to allocate a large amount of money to help the county in distress."</p>
<p>Zhejiang Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai</p>
<p>Organized the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association</p>
<p>Meeting of Promoters Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>Representatives Who Petitioned in Hangzhou Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>This year's drought in Zhejiang Province has been the most severe in history. The worst areas in the Upper River are the old Jin and Yan prefectures, and the worst areas in the Lower River are Haining in the old Hangzhou prefecture and Haiyan in the old Jiaxing prefecture. The All-Zhejiang Public Association invited fellow townsmen from Zhejiang Province in Shanghai to meet and discuss repeatedly. It was decided that various fellow townsmen organizations would organize the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association. It is now scheduled to hold the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Promoters Meeting at 3:00 PM on the 14th of this month (Friday) at the Husha Society on Guizhou Road, Beijing Road to discuss the constitution, elect standing committee members, establish a clubhouse as soon as possible, and handle disaster relief and fundraising.

The representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday to attend the various fellow townsmen associations to report.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Disaster Reports Received by Jisheng Association</p>
<p>According to Shi Jingcheng and Chen Hongcai, representatives of the begging group in the fourth district of Liyang County, this year's drought is unprecedented in a century. The disaster situation is the most serious in Liyang, with a total of six districts, especially the fourth district. The most serious areas are Shangpeibu, Shangxingbu, Tangjiaqiao, and Qiangbu, because they are located in the western border of Liyang, bordering Jurong and Lishui, and are mountainous and plateau areas. They are prone to erosion when there is water, and there is no way to irrigate them when there is drought. This year, since the rain on May 19, not a drop of water has fallen so far. The crops have withered and died, and it is difficult to replant. The four areas have become barren. There are many cases of selling children and wives, and it is not uncommon to abandon the old and young. There are even suicides in families, or deaths from starvation. The tragic situation is beyond description. According to reports from Haining, Zhejiang, a farmer named Wang Sifu committed suicide with his family. People are robbing food due to hunger. Jiashan County has dried up rivers and springs, and there is no drinking water. Starvation and escape are common. The drought in Haiyan and Yongkang counties is extremely serious, and the hunger</p>
<p>The land is miserable. A cup of water cannot save a cart of firewood. At this time when lives are hanging by a thread, those who can offer sincerity and help will live, and those who cannot will die. The dried crucian carp is hoping to be rescued from the West River, and it is really urgent.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Requesting Correction</p>
<p>Egg Business Tax in Anhui Province</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of Nanjing yesterday, (omitted title) "According to a letter from the Egg Industry Association of this city, on the 25th of last month, the National Government decided to abolish miscellaneous taxes at the National Finance Conference and ordered all provinces and cities to investigate and ban illegal taxes. When there is a conflict with the provisions of the law or decree, the Ministry of Finance may stop or abolish it at any time. We are very gratified to read it. However, according to recent investigations, the egg business tax implemented by Anhui Province is still soliciting merchants to contract, which violates Article 9 of the Business Tax Law. In addition, Article 4 of the Revised Business Tax Collection Regulations of the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance uses the value of purchased goods as the amount of operating capital and levies a heavy tax of 15 per thousand, which also violates Article 4 of the Business Tax Law's taxation standard. The value of purchased goods can only be regarded as the amount of operating income, and the highest tax rate is 10 per thousand. Now the Anhui Department of Finance mixes the amount of operating income with the amount of capital and increases the tax rate. Therefore, this egg business tax, even if it is not a miscellaneous tax, is equal to an exorbitant tax. Moreover, eggs are food and an export commodity, and it is too late to encourage tax exemption. How can we bear to levy a heavy tax, especially when rural areas are bankrupt and egg exports are declining? For this reason, we earnestly request your association to report to the Executive Yuan and order the Anhui Provincial Government to immediately abolish the Provincial Egg Business Tax Bureau in accordance with the law and merge this tax revenue into the ordinary Business Tax Bureau, and levy it at a rate of 5 per thousand in accordance with the revenue schedule of the sales industry, so as to be fair and in accordance with the law, etc. We have received this and hereby report it. According to this, we found that business tax cannot be contracted by others, and the tax rate should be collected according to the amount of capital and business income. The Business Tax Law has clear provisions. According to the previous situation, the Anhui Province has established a special bureau for the egg industry and levied a heavy tax that exceeds the law. In order to respect the law and sort out the taxes in various provinces and not allow each province to act on its own, it is urgent to correct it. It is reasonable to report the situation and ask your Yuan (Ministry) to review it and order the Anhui Provincial authorities to abolish the Provincial Egg Business Tax Bureau in accordance with the law and follow the Business Tax Law's tax rate regulations, so as to alleviate business difficulties and maintain the tax law. It is a public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully reports."</p>
<p>Firewood for Hankou Matches</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approved Exemption from Dike Construction Donation</p>
<p>Zhengda Can Apply for Refund if Donation Has Been Collected</p>
<p>The National Match Industry Association previously stated that the Hankou Customs levied a dike construction donation on matches that had already paid the unified tax, which seriously affected the development of the match industry. It specially reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance and strictly ordered the Director-General of Customs to instruct the suspension of the levy in order to comply with the regulations and sympathize with business difficulties. The association received a reply yesterday, "We have read the report. The Tax Affairs Department has notified the Customs Affairs Department by telegram and instructed the Director-General of Customs to instruct the Jianghan Customs to stop collecting the dike construction donation for goods that have paid the unified tax, and to return the dike construction donation collected after August 1. If the matches transported to Hankou by Zhengda Match Company have been collected the dike construction donation, they can hold the receipt and go directly to the customs to apply for a full refund in order to clear the procedures. Please forward this reply to Zhengda Company for their information."</p>

<h3>Reducing Railway Freight Rates and Developing the Rural Economy (9) by Wu Shaozeng</h3>
<p>All of these points are of great importance to solving the rural economic problem. The only way the railway can assist the nation in implementing social and economic policies is by taking this approach. Even if we take a step back and consider that the collapse of the rural economy has complex causes, implementing a uniform freight rate may not achieve the desired effect and may only cause the railway to suffer unnecessary losses. However, it should be considered that the railway relies on both passenger and freight transport for its maintenance, and in fact, freight transport increases, passenger transport increases accordingly; freight transport decreases, and passenger transport cannot but decrease as well. The desolation of the countryside today is known to all and need not be elaborated upon. If it is not rescued for a long time, it will inevitably fall into bankruptcy, and industry and commerce will also decline. At that time, the railway will not only have no goods to transport but may also have no passengers to transport. What losses will occur then? Therefore, instead of perishing together, why not plan ahead and substantially reduce the freight rates for agricultural products, working in conjunction with the government's various rural relief measures, to bring about a day when the dying rural economy can be revived. Moreover, if uniform freight rates are limited to certain kinds of agricultural products, then on routes with little freight, they can be used to increase freight, which would naturally be beneficial. Even on routes with relatively high freight volume, adopting this policy of small profits and quick turnover would surely increase freight volume, which would also be beneficial. Furthermore, this type of freight rate originally contains a long-term policy effect, so temporary gains and losses are not worth considering. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Reading, Questioning, and Investigating Things</h3>
<p>(1) Every sudden change, no matter what, is always a qualitative change. (2) Broken glass and a whole piece of glass are always somewhat different in nature. Even if the chemical properties are the same, the physical properties are still very different. For example, the reflectivity to light is different for broken glass. A broken mirror cannot reflect people, which is an example of qualitative change. (3) Rusting of iron is a chemical oxidation process, and violent oxidation is combustion. Therefore, the rusting of iron is also a kind of slow combustion. Ordinary combustion is a sudden phenomenon, but the rusting of iron seems to be a gradual phenomenon. But in reality, it is not so. The rusting of iron is still composed of many small, sudden changes, but they are too small for us to notice. The decay of a table can certainly be said to be gradually formed day by day. But when the degree of decay is not significant, the entire table itself is not affected, and this cannot be considered a qualitative change. Only when the decay reaches a certain level and affects the use of the table can we say that the nature of the table has changed. So this is also a change from quantity to quality. (4) The main cause of the development of all things is the contradiction within the things themselves. However, in the process of development, it must have a relationship with external objects. Therefore, the form of development is determined by external forces. Although the internal cause is the main cause, the concrete development of things is never solely dependent on the internal cause. External forces also have a certain effect. The changes that occur when pressing glass with a hand and the rusting of iron are things that can only be realized by external forces. But at the same time, if it is not glass but a copper sheet, we cannot crush it. If it is not iron but gold, it will not rust in the air. Although there is an external force, if the thing itself does not have the property of being able to change, it will still not change. The true determinant of what can be changed is still the nature of the thing itself. (5) For example, if a piece of glass accidentally falls to the ground and breaks, the breaking is inevitable because the glass has the property of being brittle. However, the event of "falling to the ground" is not necessarily inevitable. "Falling to the ground" is the form of expression of "breaking." At the same time, the fact that it breaks when it falls to the ground will only be realized for two reasons: the first is the mechanical cause of the force that causes the glass to fall; the second is the brittleness of the glass itself. The combination of these two causes is what is called the intersection of two regular processes.</p>

<p>League of Nations Initiates Film Teaching in Schools of All Levels in Various Countries</p>
<p>Entrusts China with the Organization of Educational Groups</p>
<p>The International Educational Film Association of the League of Nations, in order to promote the development of educational films as supplementary teaching tools, plans to organize film teaching groups composed of outstanding teachers from schools of all levels in various countries who are willing to dedicate their time and effort to film teaching, naming them "Educational Film Pioneers." A brief plan has been formulated and entrusted to the China Educational Film Association to organize the Chinese film teaching group. The China Educational Film Association believes that film teaching has attracted the attention of educators in China in recent years. It plans to send letters to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to inquire about teachers' opinions on film teaching in various schools in order to organize this group and seek cooperation. The original letter from the League of Nations is translated below:</p>
<p>Letter from the International Educational Film Association to the China Educational Film Association, Dear Sir, Our association has been working hard to promote the development of educational films as supplementary teaching tools. The representatives of various countries at the last International Conference on Educational Films unanimously approved. We feel that the activities of our association in this direction need to be disseminated to ensure the direct and organized cooperation of the best representatives of the entire teaching world.</p>
<p>We believe that the success of adopting teaching films as teaching tools and how to make organized use of them is closely related to the attitude of teachers in general towards this issue. Therefore, our association decided to launch a joint solicitation of "groups in various countries that use films as supplementary teaching tools," and in the future, a national organization will be established at the association's location. Teachers in general, whether in words or actions, who express their willingness to spend time and effort to make beneficial efforts on teaching films, deeply know that students can get great results from this wonderful auxiliary tool.</p>
<p>This group, named "Educational Film Pioneers," the Rome Association is convinced that teachers can give considerable support and, as a result, a group that can use the energy of young people can demand and get the entire use of films in schools around the world.</p>
<p>Educational Film Pioneers are teachers, and at the same time, the most suitable cooperator and consultant for publicizing to colleagues and school authorities, so that they can finally prepare tools for schools in their respective countries to use films in schools. The Rome Headquarters will prepare a simple, clear and applicable plan, the implementation of which depends on groups in various countries using films as supplementary teaching tools. This plan will be the basis for various regulations. The regulations are the same for groups in various countries. The main points of this plan are as follows: A. Promote the use of teaching films by teachers through special lectures and organize psychological, technical, and teaching training. B. Promote the establishment of a technical and psychological committee, trusted by the school authorities, to entrust the production of teaching films and supervise their full use. C. The committee must coordinate teaching films with school curricula and textbooks. To the extent possible, the government should stipulate the subjects of various courses. In various schools, it should be made as suitable as possible for the presentation of films.</p>
<p>D. Directly organize, or jointly organize with school authorities, various competitions for school teachers and technical experts. According to the technical and psychological committee, the subject matter of educational films of various subjects is proposed.</p>
<p>E. Raise funds, and it is necessary to ensure that at least one set of film projection equipment must be available in schools of any level, whether in rural or urban areas, which can be used for school lessons.</p>
<p>F. Strive to promote the organization and establishment of school film libraries, and at the same time take into account their recurring expenses.</p>
<p>The above are the main points, and other detailed methods will be added at any time to improve them.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that people from all countries who are enthusiastic about supporting this initiative will cooperate with our association to make this pioneering career for the benefit of students around the world a success.</p>
<p>We respectfully entrust your association to organize this group in your country to promote the use of teaching films in your country, so that we can achieve our common mission. I hope that you can be an important partner of our association and look forward to good news. President De Fiero,</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Favors</p>
<p>Students from Border Provinces</p>
<p>Revising the Regulations on the Treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan Students</p>
<p>The Same Treatment for the Provinces of Xinjiang, Gansu, Kang, and Ningxia</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of students from border areas coming to Beijing to study has gradually increased. The Ministry of Education has formulated regulations on the treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan students to facilitate their admission. In order to broaden the scope, it is proposed that students from Xinjiang, Gansu, Xikang, and Ningxia provinces should also be entitled to the same treatment. The regulations have been revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The revised regulations are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Revised Regulations on the Treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan Students, Article 1, Mongolian and Tibetan students coming to the Central Government and various provinces for study shall be treated in accordance with these Regulations, unless otherwise specified. Article 2, The following agencies may recommend Mongolian and Tibetan students to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission or its Beijing Office before the start of the school term each year, but must provide the student's: (1) name, (2) gender, (3) age, (4) place of origin, (5) academic qualifications, (6) character evaluation, (7) language skills, and attach two 2.5-inch photos of the student. (1) Mongolian league and banner official offices, (2) Tibetan local official offices, (3) Mongolian and Tibetan schools at all levels, (4) Provincial and county governments along the border connected with Mongolia and Tibet. Article 3, The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission or its Beijing Office should clearly transfer the students recommended by various agencies to schools at all levels. If there are vacancies in the schools, they should accept these students. Except for those who meet the qualifications and can be placed in the appropriate class, all are regarded as auditors, but only those who can directly listen to lectures. Whether they are formal or auditors, all schools that admit Mongolian and Tibetan students should report to the Ministry of Education separately or forward them for record. Article 4, Mongolian and Tibetan auditors who pass the academic year examination in each school should be changed to formal students of this class, and those who fail are still auditors. A certificate of attendance is given after the auditing period expires. Article 5, Each school should send the academic year results or graduation results of Mongolian and Tibetan students to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission at the end of each academic year for separate awards or recommendations to equivalent schools at home and abroad for further studies. Article 6, Mongolian and Tibetan students who graduate from specialized or higher education institutions may be selected by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for recommendation, and various agencies may distribute them to serve in Mongolian and Tibetan areas. Article 7, Mongolian and Tibetan students who are introduced by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission or its Beijing Office should be exempted from all tuition fees in public schools and should be given appropriate reductions in private schools. Article 8, If there are regulations such as subsidies and sending students to study abroad for general formal students in various schools, formal Mongolian and Tibetan students should receive the same treatment. Article 9, The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and its Beijing Office shall provide appropriate hospitality to Mongolian and Tibetan students who come to Beijing and Ping for the first time to study and who are proven to be true. Article 10, If any Mongolian and Tibetan students in various schools are found to be imposters, in addition to expelling the student, all expenses incurred by the student shall be recovered from the original sending agency or its guarantor. Article 11, Students from Xinjiang and Xikang provinces who come to the Central Government and various provinces for study may be treated in accordance with these Regulations. The recommending agencies are the provincial and county governments and schools at all levels where the students are located. Article 12, Students from Qinghai and Ningxia provinces who come to the Central Government and various provinces for study may be treated in accordance with Articles 3, 4, and 7 of these Regulations. The recommending agencies shall be handled in accordance with Article 11. Article 13, Students from Gansu Province who come to the Central Government and various provinces for study with qualified graduation certificates shall be treated in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of these Regulations. The recommending agencies shall be as stipulated in Article 11. Article 14, If there are any matters not covered in these Regulations, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education may submit them to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the National Government for approval and revision. Article 15, These Regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center</p>
<p>Proceeding with Editing Daily Newspaper Indexes</p>
<p>Decided to Include Various Daily Newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Other Places</p>
<p>This Kind of Undertaking Is Still an Original Creation in the Country</p>
<p>Daily newspaper indexes are only seen in large-scale newspaper offices in various countries. Other cultural institutions rarely hold them. The Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center, in view of the fact that daily newspapers are a ledger of the activities of the entire society, and a measure of the transfer of personnel, which become historical materials after time passes, will inevitably have many omissions without an index. However, the classification is cumbersome, the procedures are complicated, and it is several times more than magazine indexes. Now, after a long period of research by the center, the classification items have been properly drafted and started. The newspapers on which it is based are decided to be major daily newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other cities. The method is different from newspaper clippings, but the function is roughly the same. This kind of undertaking is still an original creation in the country.</p>
<p>China Arts and Crafts Society</p>
<p>Publishing Consulting Work is Tense</p>
<p>Authors Come to Register</p>
<p>The China Arts and Crafts Society, in view of the increasing complexity of social affairs and personnel, and in order to meet the needs of young people, planned to set up a personnel consulting office this spring. The first step, the publishing consulting group, was established in July, and He Bingsong and Shu Xincheng were hired as group leaders, respectively. Since the beginning of the service, there have been several cases of manuscript registration, review, introduction of authors, registration and collection of solicited manuscripts of publishers, and investigation of new books every day. The work is very tense. The service hours of the group are from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm every day. If all sectors have publishing affairs entrusted, no remuneration will be accepted.</p>
<p>The Re-launched Issue of Educational Magazine is Published</p>
<p>Educational Magazine was founded by the Commercial Press in the late Qing Dynasty and has been published continuously for more than 20 years. It is a major authority among educational publications in China. Its contribution to the improvement of education in China has long been recognized by educators. However, the "January 28th" Incident occurred in 1932, and the general factory of the Commercial Press was destroyed, and Educational Magazine was also suspended. When the museum resumed business, due to the limitation of production capacity, only the four major magazines, such as the East, were relaunched first. In recent years, the printing work of the museum has made great progress, and all aspects of our country are striving for the revival movement. The voice of education to save the country is particularly high. The re-launch of Educational Magazine cannot be delayed. The museum has been preparing for several months, and the re-launched issue of Educational Magazine was finally re-launched on the 10th of this month to meet with the Chinese people. The magazine is edited by He Bingsong and has more than 70 special writers, all of whom are educational experts in the country. The authors who wrote for the inaugural issue, in addition to the staff of the society, include Wang Shijie, Wang Yunwu, Feng Zikai, Chang Daozhi, Zhang Qixian, Jiang Wenyu, Zhao Yan, Cheng Qibao, Ma Zongrong, Chen Lijiang, Du Zuozhou, Jiang Qi, Zhuang Zexuan, Gao Juefu, Shen Yougan, He Qingru, Zhong Daozan, Yu Ziyi, Zhao Tingwei, Zhou Xianwen, etc., more than 30 people, each expressing their grand opinions, which is a grand view. It is also heard that the magazine is now offering a half-price pre-order method, 12 issues for the whole year, only receiving 90 cents, as a commemoration of the re-launch.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Goods Weekly</p>
<p>Contribution Talk</p>
<h3>This Week</h3>
<p>— Yang Yan</p>
<p>There are some good news in the Chinese goods industry this week:</p>
<p>The education authorities have issued a notice that all student uniform supplies must be purchased from domestic goods. Chairman Chiang of Nanchang has issued a notice that all formal dresses nationwide must be made of domestic goods.</p>
<p>The Minister of Industry is paying attention to the overseas promotion of domestic goods and has ordered the International Trade Bureau to actively carry out the promotion.</p>
<p>The Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee is holding mobile exhibitions in various schools and sending personnel to various places to promote the use of domestic goods.</p>
<p>The China National Goods Company, in conjunction with nine major domestic goods factories, held a temporary national goods market to commemorate the "September 18th" Incident.</p>
<p>The Family Industry Society has initiated a joint exhibition of domestic cosmetics by various factories in the same industry.</p>
<p>From the above news, we feel that the life and future of Chinese domestic goods are very promising. The administrative authorities are sincerely helping, the social figures are enthusiastically proceeding, and the domestic goods companies and domestic goods factories themselves are also seizing the opportunity to constantly exert their strength to contribute to society. What is especially worth commemorating is the China National Goods Company's temporary national goods market commemorating the "September 18th" Incident. It brings together the achievements of nine factories to commemorate publicly, with far-reaching implications and profound significance. Some people said angrily: "One commemoration, two commemorations, three commemorations, all are fantasies. We have been living in fantasies for three years, and the lessons learned have been enough. The only way out is to repay eye for eye, tooth for tooth, cannon against cannon, bomber against bomber. We believe that armed self-defense can maintain national survival." This statement is very reasonable, but I would like to add one more sentence: "Our only way out is to be self-sufficient in every paper and needle, not to rely on foreign countries for every cup and basin, not to let foreigners and enemies earn my money in any way. We believe that economic self-defense can maintain the permanent survival of the nation." Therefore, to commemorate this painful "September 18th" Incident, we should never forget to use domestic goods at all times, and we should contribute to society at all times, so that we will not fail to live up to this meaningful commemoration.</p>
<p>But there is a bad contradictory news, which is that Guangdong Province levies special taxes on goods from other provinces, which contains the meaning of feudal separatism and is tantamount to destroying the domestic goods of the country. I think if you really love the country and have a conscience, you will always hope that this news is not true.</p>
<p>"National hatred has not been avenged and our hearts are still hot. Why should we rely on others for our needs?" Chinese people with ambition and blood, wake up!</p>
<p>Discussion of National Goods</p>
<h3>The Crisis and Salvation of the Future of National Products</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The future of the domestic product production industry, fraught with difficulties and lurking dangers, seems to be dominated by fate, filled with "many disasters and hardships," constantly facing the onslaught of storms without any chance of relaxation. This year, American inflation has raised silver prices, attempting to achieve industrial prosperity through exchange rate manipulation and the large-scale dumping of goods at a loss in various parts of our country. This alone is enough to stifle our nascent domestic products. Recently, the newly promulgated customs tariffs, with their reduction of various import taxes, have dealt an even more forceful blow. Surrounded by an atmosphere of overproduction, "shutdowns," and "work reductions," those engaged in domestic products are deeply disheartened. However, "adversity strengthens the nation," the best encouragement from the ancients, "the darker it is, the more eager the heart seeks light." We should embrace this spirit to overcome current suffering and expand future paths.</p>
<p>When discussing policies to rescue domestic products from their current predicament, there are many, but broadly speaking, they all boil down to two shortcuts: encouraging all Chinese people to use domestic products and expanding international trade. It would be even better if both could be pursued simultaneously. I dare to briefly discuss them as follows:</p>
<p>1. Deeply Rooted in the People: "Promoting domestic products" must strive for depth and universality among the people. Empty slogans shouted by a portion of the city are useless, as everyone knows. Therefore, the wave of domestic product exhibitions in various places in recent years is a preliminary effort to publicize and introduce these products. The greatness of the recent Northwest Exhibition and the importance of the missions of the Huazhong and Huabei inspection teams organized by various factories occupy a significant position in the process of domestic products reaching the interior. What we particularly hope for is that domestic product companies in various regions can be established on schedule, forming a national network of domestic products. The recent opening of the Zhengzhou domestic product company and the preparations in Wenzhou and Jiaxing, which are reportedly nearing completion and will be officially inaugurated soon, will undoubtedly add a unique luster to the future of our domestic products.</p>
<p>2. Expanding Overseas: China is inherently a vast country with abundant resources. However, due to our own immature technology and backward production, we are instead subjected to the invasion of goods from industrially advanced countries. In fact, if we can vigorously improve various products and strive for perfection, why wouldn't we have a large number of exportable goods? Recently, it was reported that the International Trade Bureau, considering that our country's products have historically been handled by foreign firms, has specially introduced British and American merchants for direct procurement. Furthermore, an American merchant is actively preparing to collect over 150 kinds of domestic products and will ship them to Europe and America for promotion on a regular basis. This is indeed a great blessing for the future of our domestic products. In various parts of Southeast Asia, due to the strong patriotism of overseas Chinese, now is the time to boycott foreign goods, and it is imperative to promote our domestic products in these areas, a golden opportunity that should not be missed.</p>
<p>Do not be discouraged, do not be disheartened. "Only struggle is the way out." We should embrace this spirit to defeat evil and find light.</p>
<h3>The Basic Work of Promoting Domestic Products</h3>
<p>— Bian Beichen</p>
<p>In the minds of nine out of ten uneducated Chinese, they may not know what patriotism is, but their vanity is particularly strong. Daily life, including clothing, food, housing, and transportation, relies entirely on European and American goods, which has led to the current economic panic and the recession of domestic industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>Therefore, inferior domestic manufacturers, in order to cater to the psychology of customers who love foreign goods, or in other words, for the sake of making money, use names similar to foreign goods on their products, or print many foreign words on the boxes and packaging of their products, even without a single Chinese character. In this way, they become Westernized! Westernization can enable cold-blooded animals who do not know foreign languages but prefer foreign goods to buy in large quantities.</p>
<p>Here, I must clarify that I am not fundamentally opposed to domestic manufacturers using foreign languages on their products if their products are sold abroad. However, their products are sold entirely within the country!</p>
<p>At the same time, I also feel that using foreign languages on one's own domestic products can mislead those who genuinely love domestic products but lack the ability to distinguish them.</p>
<p>I believe that to promote domestic products, it is necessary to implement basic work. What is the basic work? First, the Chinese people should abandon the mentality of worshiping foreign goods. Second, domestic products should not use foreign languages unless they are sold abroad. If this can be done consistently, it will definitely be successful in three years!</p>
<p>Discussions on Domestic Products</p>
<h3>Small Customs Should Be Under Martial Law</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>The role of customs is twofold: to prevent the entry of foreign goods and to protect the country's production industry. Its impact on the overall national economy and people's livelihood is extremely significant. Therefore, any independent country, or a country that hopes to survive freely and equally in the world, has absolute autonomy over customs, because it is truly the lifeline of the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>However, in China, since the opening of maritime trade, the power of tariffs has been controlled by foreigners. Therefore, the so-called "customs" not only cannot fulfill the responsibility of protecting domestic industry and commerce, but also serves as a gateway for foreign goods to enter the country, resulting in a growing trade deficit year after year, and the national economy and people's livelihood are becoming increasingly strained. We find this situation extremely painful and hope that the government authorities will have autonomous control over tariffs, reduce the trade deficit, and alleviate the economic hardship of the people.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we can say that the major customs, which are related to the overall national economy and people's livelihood, should resolutely become autonomous. In other words, they should be placed under strict martial law to prevent foreign goods from crossing the line. However, at the same time, let us take a step back and think that strict martial law should also be imposed on the small customs on each individual. What is the meaning of martial law on individual small customs? This means that to prevent the invasion of foreign goods, on the national level, we should certainly use the power of the government to strive for full autonomy of tariffs. On the individual level, in addition to wearing and using various necessities, we should try our best to use domestic products. At the same time, we must not allow foreign goods to enter our food, which is my explanation of why small customs should be under martial law.</p>
<p>Don't you believe it? Please read the news published in various newspapers on September 1:</p>
<p>"International Trade Bureau news: The value of shark fins imported for entertaining guests by the upper and middle classes in the first seven months of this year was 8,980,072 gold units, equivalent to 1,791,653 yuan in national currency, a significant increase compared to the same period last year, when it was only 1,280,730 yuan, an increase of more than 500,000 yuan. In July alone, it was 1,085,555 gold units, equivalent to 216,567 yuan in national currency, most of which was consumed in this city. This shows the extravagance of the people in Shanghai," and so on.</p>
<p>Alas, upon seeing this news, the reporter could not help but sigh three times, believing that this is a disgrace to the Chinese people, especially the bourgeois class in Shanghai. In such a serious national crisis, everyone is still indulging in pleasure, which is a very infuriating matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am proposing the slogan that small customs should be under martial law and contributing it to the general bourgeois class and those who indulge in pleasure. Please pay attention to whether foreign goods are mixed into the imports of small customs from now on. In this way, the trade deficit may be reduced in the future, and the newspapers will no longer publish heartbreaking news.</p>
<h3>This Publication's Announcement</h3>
<p>The 86th issue of this publication, which should be published on September 20, will be published in advance on September 18 as a "Nine Factories' Domestic Products Temporary Special Issue" in commemoration. Contributions from readers should be around 300 words and have significant meaning.</p>
<h3>From "Foreign Goods Stores" to "Domestic Products Companies"</h3>
<p>— Ye Yiyi</p>
<p>Recently, domestic product companies have been established one after another, which we believe is a very good phenomenon. Domestic product companies collect domestic goods from all over the country, serving as a domestic product exhibition that allows local people to have a good understanding of domestic products. On the other hand, they gather the products of various domestic manufacturers, allowing inland people to have a good opportunity to choose and purchase them, which is an excellent method.</p>
<p>However, let us now examine the conflict between domestic and foreign goods in the inland areas, and the potential power of foreign goods in the inland areas.</p>
<p>We know that the organizations that promote both domestic and foreign goods are generally called "stores." The name "domestic product company" has only been heard in recent years! Then, before the name "domestic product company" existed, and even now that the name "domestic product company" exists, when people want to buy clothing materials, they always say, "Go to the foreign goods store!" This is the case in the inland areas, both in the past and now. Isn't it also the case in Shanghai? Friends, haven't you heard people say, "To buy clothing materials, go to the foreign goods stores in Xiaodongmen!"</p>
<p>In fact, the term "foreign goods store" has been deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public. Many people will always say "foreign goods store" without thinking. Even if a store sells domestic goods, or does not sell foreign goods at all, people will still call it "foreign goods store."</p>
<p>Alas! Thinking of this, how can we not be heartbroken? It seems that there are no domestic goods besides "foreign goods," and that only "foreign" is worthy, and that "foreign" is the only merchandise. The word "domestic" has disappeared and no longer exists in dictionaries. Without "domestic," how can there be "goods"? Alas!</p>
<p>I personally believe that before widely establishing domestic product companies in the inland areas, we should pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Completely overthrow the name "foreign goods store" so that people no longer have this term in their minds. To achieve this, in addition to the self-awareness of the general public, we should also think of a method to make it a matter of great shame if one does not purchase goods from a "domestic product company."</p>
<p>(2) "Foreign goods stores" in the inland areas should specialize in selling foreign goods. Shopkeepers should be aware and stop selling foreign goods, establishing the signboard of "××" or "×××" domestic product company.</p>
<p>(3) When promoting "domestic product companies" in the inland areas, there should also be an organized and powerful guiding group. In addition, local education authorities should also cooperate.</p>
<p>(4) Propaganda is an effective policy.</p>
<p>Whether the above four points are appropriate, please give me your guidance!</p>
<h3>Short News</h3>

<h3>Chewing Words</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Even now, I still feel it is a pity that Turkey abolished the Arabic alphabet and adopted the Latin alphabet. The Arabic alphabet is simple to learn and write, has strict rules, and can adapt to changes in language. Adopting the Latin alphabet only increases cumbersomeness, and it is inconvenient to learn block letters when learning to read and cursive script when writing.</p>
<p>Except for Chinese characters, most of the syllabic alphabets in Asia are better than the European-style phonetic alphabets. Certainty and simplicity are the most obvious. The abolition or retention of the two should at least have equal opportunities.</p>
<p>Language unity is a superficial rather than profound saying. The so-called unity means that the written text is read out as speech. As for how to write it and based on what to write it, there is a complex interaction of visual and auditory senses in the process. The complexity is an exchange rather than unity.</p>
<p>European-style writing sees an object visually, transforms it into auditory language, analyzes it into words audibly, transforms it into visual form, and then transforms it into language. Asian-style alphabets save one step of auditory analysis.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the process of constructing Chinese characters is even shorter. It goes from a visual object to a visual character and then to auditory language. Naturally, someone will say that a visual object must constitute an image of the object, and the image is the language. The process is not shorter. I don't want to argue about this statement. Our problem can avoid such complexity and be replaced by a simple mechanical statement.</p>
<p>Astronomers uniformly use ⊙ to represent the sun, and mathematicians uniformly use 　 to represent a triangle. If the visual object is not converted into sound by human light sensation, but into sound by mechanical light sensation, then the same machine will certainly convert it into the same sound.</p>
<p>In both aspects, it proves that humans are quite similar machines. History has made me complex. In unnecessary aspects, we should seek to reduce a little complexity. If mechanical language can be successful, expressing a certain image with a certain sound can achieve basic language unity.</p>
<p>The sound generated by current mechanical light sensation is inevitably wave-like. We may not be able to create a machine that can sense the light of shapes such as ⊙　 and convert it into a sound close to human voice. The wax discs of gramophone records and the wavy patterns on the film of sound movies can be converted into human language, but whether these wavy patterns can be created by humans and whether there is considerable freedom in creating them are all problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps the ideal of creating a form-meaning text that is commonly understood by all mankind should be abandoned in the end. Then we should now admit that unified phonetics is the only reform that can be achieved in the near future. There should also be some ideals under this reform, and it is not that the Latin alphabet can satisfy everything.</p>
<p>If a letter I can emit a bottom sound under a light-sensing machine, and MI two mothers can emit a rice sound, then promoting the Latin alphabet can naturally have permanent convenience. It is still unknown whether Westerners can have this achievement, and even if they can, it seems that the period is far away. As for the wavy patterns on wax discs and film, although they are now so complicated that they cannot be used daily, it is not a distant hope to improve them to be simple enough to become a new type of alphabet.</p>
<p>Filmmakers have hoped for several years to be able to create sound film copies in different languages in the study, borrowing the benefits of being simpler and more accurate than re-recording. After its success, they will inevitably further hope to simplify the drawing of wavy patterns, which should not be impossible to succeed.</p>
<p>Or some people think that since the human brain can make more ingenious reactions than machines, why wait for mechanical proof? However, the so-called ingenious reaction comes from the accumulation of energy. The inconvenience of Chinese characters is because they require longer training and accumulate more energy. If the machine can react equally, it not only proves that the reaction process is simple, but also that the machine can replace a part of the energy that needs to be spent, wouldn't it be better?</p>
<p>The first-style Mandarin phonetic symbols have always been ridiculed by linguists as being too clumsy, but in fact, the clumsiness of Roman style is only a matter of degree. What can be achieved by today's ideals has already been able to go beyond some.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid that the ideal alphabet is far away. You must know that even if we immediately promote the Latin alphabet, it cannot be popularized in less than ten years. Thinking that it can save the emergency is unreliable.</p>
<p>If it is for an emergency, the existing light-sensitive sounding reading machine is also a way. Try taking the reactions of various Chinese characters and observing the resulting sounds. It is not difficult to convert that sound wave into language, just like receiving wireless telegrams. But I am afraid that the sound wave is more complicated than the word, but we might as well try.</p>
<p>But the problem comes again, even if this road can be connected, after that book is converted into sound waves and then into language, can it really make the illiterate listen? Our current big problem is not that there is no way to chew words, but that there are too many ways to chew words.</p>

<h3>How I Write a Script (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Written by Olisa, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>He fell in love with Martha.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>A lonely old man fell in love with a young woman.</p>
<p>Probably, at some time, he had cured her scarlet fever. She was thirteen years old then. He fell in love with this child then.</p>
<p>He recited the following lines about himself:</p>
<p>"With a farewell smile, love may make my desolate ending a little brighter."</p>
<p>Then cried. Once, he cried so hard that his collar was soaked.</p>
<p>A lonely doctor with a collar soaked in tears.</p>
<p>He thought he was an interesting person.</p>
<p>Why is he a doctor? In an article, I once said that the issue of weapons in drama affects scriptwriting. In this script, I am preparing for a murder scene. I use a doctor to plan this murder. It is easier for doctors to commit murder. That way, there are no obstacles. Doctors have poison, and even if they don't, it is always easy to get poison. Therefore, I gave the profession of doctor to the murderer. I imagine that this doctor loves art and loves the stage, and he has a special view of life. He looks at life through the prism of art. He can imagine unusual actions.</p>
<p>Martha came home from work.</p>
<p>The husband wondered, "Why are you so late?" She always comes home at the same time, but he always asks her why she is so late. That is his character. He is thinking about eating, and he is waiting for dinner. He sees that the reason that makes him feel hungry emerges in his wife's image.</p>
<p>Martha prepared the dinner that her father had started.</p>
<p>They sat down to eat dinner.</p>
<p>We try to use everyday conversations in this drama. That kind of messy, incoherent conversation that keeps changing topics.</p>
<p>They were eating dinner.</p>
<p>Husband (to Martha) "Hey, did you cut your hair?"</p>
<p>Martha: "Oh! I cut it yesterday! Didn't you see it?"</p>
<p>Husband: "Doctor Gefinkel is really something."</p>
<p>Father: "Martha, be careful. Look, you've soiled the tablecloth. I keep saying he's crazy."</p>
<p>Martha: "I didn't cut it too small, did I?"</p>
<p>Father: "What does it matter anyway? He's a stage doctor."</p>
<p>Husband: "He was sitting by the road all night. How come we don't have any matches?"</p>
<p>Martha: "You're making fun of him! He's a very nice person. I just saw the matches."</p>
<p>Father: "Look, every time I eat the last dessert, I always feel like it's too much."</p>
<p>Doctor Gefinkel came in.</p>
<p>They asked him why he was sitting by the road all night. The husband lay down on the couch.</p>
<p>Husband: "I came home and saw our doctor sitting there. What does that mean? At first, I didn't even recognize him."</p>
<p>Martha: (to her husband) "I'll get you a pillow."</p>
<p>Father: "Give him one."</p>
<p>Husband: (continues his story about the doctor) "And another thing - it was raining. Thank you, Marsha." (Marsha's nickname - translator's note)</p>
<p>Father: "That's right, it rained yesterday."</p>
<p>Husband: "That's where I saw Doctor Gefinkel sitting...."</p>
<p>The theme of this drama: A socialist society must be a complete society. Doctor Gefinkel came up with the following opinion: If the system of the whole society becomes better, then every member of the society must also become better. In a socialist society, people should be more pure and more noble.</p>
<p>This is Gefinkel's idea. He knows that there is some kind of struggle going on in the world, and he knows that it is a violent struggle. It is not right to show mercy to the enemy. However, the doctor is thinking about a classless society. In his opinion, a preparation is necessary to realize such a society. A classless society is a society where the relationship between people must be complete. This should be told to people. According to Gefinkel, in a classless society, one must pay attention to people's character and their improvement.</p>
<p>What he saw was:</p>
<p>A good woman loves a bad man. Martha loves an egoist. A shallow character, a person with the nature of a propertied class. How can this work? Is this right? Isn't there something wrong here? If there is something wrong here, then it must be explained and corrected. How can this be corrected?</p>
<p>Husband: "We were waiting for you, Doctor. You can tell us what you were doing by the road, right?"</p>
<p>Doctor: "I was trying to solve a problem."</p>
<p>Husband: "A problem?"</p>
<p>Doctor: "Yes. If in a socialist society, a good woman loves a bad man, what should be done?"</p>
<p>Husband: "What do you mean by a bad man? Do you think the world is made up of good people and bad people?"</p>
<p>Doctor: "That's what I think."</p>
<p>Husband: "Society is divided into classes, but it is not divided according to character."</p>
<p>Doctor: "I know this too, but I am still thinking about a classless society."</p>
<p>Husband: "Bah! Classless society is still far away - they say it will be completed by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan."</p>
<p>Doctor: "It's not that far."</p>
<p>Husband: "So, you think there won't be character struggles in a classless society?"</p>
<p>Doctor: "Yes."</p>
<p>Husband: "Interesting!"</p>
<p>Doctor: "Very interesting. For example, I think in a classless society, they would kill egoists."</p>
<p>Husband: "Nonsense!"</p>

<p>Although Silver Markets in England and America Both Shrank</p>
<p>The Premium Recovered Well by Only One Yuan</p>
<p>The Central Bank Continues to Disburse Cash</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate Remains Firm, and Market Conditions Are Difficult to Revive</p>
<p>After the general sentiment in the gold market shifted from firm to stable, yesterday's market saw both the English and American silver markets shrink. The opening was quite stable, but soon the banks' appetite became clogged and the Chinese merchants' buying power had already begun to decline. The exchange rate hardened, and hedging sales were frequent. Across the board, prices fell in the morning, while exchange rates lengthened. London raw gold fell by eight pence. American cotton rose by ten points, American wheat rose by one cent, and stocks fell slightly. Preliminary trading outside the market opened and immediately rose to fifty-five or fifty-six yuan. Ultimately, due to the rise in exchange rates, sentiment did not appear particularly strong. Sources poured in taking advantage of the high prices, leading to a downstream effect. After opening, the market still looked stable, but because the banks' appetite was clogged, the domestic market tended to loosen, and the situation softened. In addition, there was prior news of the HSBC bank quoting prices, with English at par and American rising by 125. Sentiment was slightly uneasy and low. At this time, because the Central Bank frequently disburses cash, spot dealers rushed to bid on futures, struggling to a great extent, but sellers still showed their power, and the general trend remained sluggish. However, large investors still had an appetite to buy at low prices, and banks once took advantage of the cheapness to buy in. After the low, there was still a rebound, but the rising trend was not good, and soon it fell again. The banks' selling appetite had not diminished slightly, and the domestic market continued to loosen. Hedging sales resumed, making it difficult for the gold market to support itself. Generally, many small investors closed out their positions, nearly approaching the fifty-yuan mark. However, because this price seemed too cheap, the silver market predicted that it would not rise excessively. There was buying interest taking advantage of the low prices, and transactions were also fewer. Gradually, it pulled up. At noon, the situation was particularly stable. The morning situation was firm at first but then weakened, mainly because the number of chips decreased and the short-sellers' will was firm. In addition, the bill transactions between Chinese merchants and banks remained the same as before. The industry's appetite was therefore flat, and the exchange rate hardened. After hedging sales, the general trend should have been weak. The number of chips has now decreased to over 32,000, so the swap this time should not be excessively exploited. The market situation for the morning is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 953.8 yuan, up two yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 3.6 yuan. The morning opening exchange rates were a spot selling price of English currency at 1 shilling 4 and 9375 pence, and American currency at 35 yuan 375 and 4375 for pairing. Fuxingyong Nati was up to 4.3 yuan. HSBC closed November at 5 pence per shilling. Dadecheng Hengyu Dafayong Fuchang Hengtai sold Nati, retreating to 3 yuan. Yicheng Zhaofengchang took advantage of the low price to buy Nati, pulling it up by 5 jiao. It was learned that HSBC quoted the English at par and the American up by 125. There were many sellers. Dafayong also sold, retreating to 2.5 yuan. Hengxing Fuxingyong Qianchang Xiangyingfeng Hengtianfeng still bought. With the Central Bank opening for disbursement, it rebounded to 3.2 yuan, but Sanjing issued December's American gold at 625, and Jiaotong closed the same month at 6875. Qingfayong Dafayong Yifengyong Hengtai Tongtaichang, etc., sold fiercely, falling to 1.4 yuan. Zhaofengchang Dadecheng Yongli Yongfeng took advantage of the low price to buy Nati, rising to 2.5 yuan. The exchange rate was still loose. Yifengyong Hengxing Tongyi sold, dropping again to 1.5 yuan. At this time, Yuanmaoyong worked hard to buy in, still struggling. When McGallie closed December's American gold at 6875, the downward trend was even stronger. Jiaotong also closed the same month at the same price. Under Yifengyong Richang Hengyu Yuankang Xiang Qingfayong's sales, they seized the opportunity to cut losses, pouring in orders, and fell to 0.2 yuan. Yuanxing Tianfeng Dingtai took advantage of the low price to buy Nati, rising to 1.4 yuan. Shunmao sold, retreating to 0.6 yuan. Hengyu Tianfeng Yuanshengyong Yifengyong Yuqingyong Dadecheng, etc., jointly purchased, gradually rising to 3 yuan. After fluctuating, the noon closing was 952.8 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 3 yuan. After the close, Yongli sold some, and the situation was peaceful. The highest price during the morning was 954.3 yuan, and the lowest price was 950.2 yuan, with a difference of 4.1 yuan. As a result, it rebounded by 1 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was 35 yuan due to HSBC Bank's American exchange rate listing, which was 125 higher, corresponding to a gold premium of 988 yuan and 5 jiao 7 fen. According to the closing price, it was about 36 yuan weaker, less than 4 yuan compared to the previous close. The registration price for this month was 954 yuan, and for October, it was 953 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 954 yuan. The red gold price still followed the addition of 11 yuan, listed at 964.8 yuan. There were fewer transactions in the market, only Tongfenheng buying more than 1,000 taels of 993 fineness, adding 13 yuan, which was sold by small money houses. The Central Bank's cash disbursement appetite was very diligent. About 1,000 orders were continuously sold through spot dealers such as Yingfenheng Tai Kangrun Dadecheng Tongfenheng, etc. The price started from 953.5 yuan, decreasing sequentially, mostly from 2.5 to 3.5 yuan, because the gold price was cheaper. This month's bars have entered a sluggish state. As of today, the bulls include Yifengyong Fuyu with over 200 orders each, Dadecheng with over 100 orders, and Shenkang Dachangxiang Huiyuan Yingfenheng Yuan Dahui Xiang, etc., with scattered amounts. The bears include Fuchang with over 400, Hengyu with over 300, and Dafengheng with 70 orders. A total of 798 orders remain. There are 9 bullish firms and 3 bearish firms.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were average, and there were quite a few hedging sales. In summary, Yifengyong Hengyu Fuchang Xianghe Futaiheng Dadecheng Dafayong Fuyu Yuanxing Dingtai Shenkang Hengxing Qingfayong Hengtai Tongtaichang Wanxing, etc., were on the selling side. Tianfeng Tongfenheng Yingfenheng Zhengchang Tongchun Hongxing Yiyu Fuxingyong Qianchang Xiang Hengxingyuan Tongfu Fuan Yuanmaoyong Zhaofengchang Yuanshengyong, etc., were on the selling side. Yongli Fuxingyong advanced first and then exited. Dadecheng Hengtai exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang Wanxing jointly did over 1,400 orders, offsetting over 200 orders. Shunli jointly did over 200 orders, slightly offsetting. The Guangdong gang Shengda was average, Hengxing entering and exiting 100 orders each. The total number of transactions for the day was 32,452 orders.</p>
<p>For October futures, the bulls include Wanxing with over 5,300 orders, Shunli with over 3,700, Dadecheng with over 2,300, Fuchang with over 1,700, Yifengyong with over 1,500, Shunmao and Hengxing with over 1,300 each, Runchangyu with over 1,100, Huixiang and Tongfenheng with over 1,200 each, Shengda with over 900, Fuxingyong and Daxingyong with over 800 each, Qiaofengyong with over 700, Yuanheng Dingkang with over 200 each, and Dashunyongli with over 500 each.

The market situation gradually became lively, and people's hearts were encouraged, leading to an upward trend in various market prices. The silver discount had already reached 1 jiao 3 fen in the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 2 fen compared to the previous day, almost the same as when silver flowed out last month. The initial increase in "hua tou jia shui" (a type of brokerage fee) was also raised to 6 fen, but it returned to 3 fen because there was no large demand. In terms of swap transactions, morning market transfers and new transactions totaled more than 3.9 million, and afternoon market transactions totaled more than 200,000.

<p>Securities The Bond Market Forms a Fluctuating Situation</p>
<p>---Most Transactions are Swaps---</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market tended to fluctuate and become chaotic. The atmosphere in the market was idle. Different people had different views. Most of the large investors' buying and selling were still swap transactions. Number 4 bonds were slightly bought in. The silver discount was listed at 1 jiao 3 fen, which had no impact on the market. The majority of both sides were watching, and it was feared that there would be no major waves for the time being. The trend at the opening yesterday seemed weak, but due to swap relations, the rises and falls could not be consistent. It was chaotic and there were few transactions. People still felt depressed. The second session uniformly retreated slightly, with salt tax retreating about half a yuan and the rest also retreating by 2 or 3 jiao. In the afternoon session, the above continued to retreat slightly. Salt tax turned upwards due to the high demand for Number 4 bonds, so it rebounded by 4 jiao. After that, it also improved by 2 or 3 jiao. The market was flat and tired. As a result of the day, the variations ranged from 1 or 2 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. The total volume was 15,565,500 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: Yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yarn Cotton Traded Yarn Shows a Flat and Weak Attitude Again</p>
<p>The yarn market is flat and tired, and the situation is gradually entering a fluctuating phase, but the spot yarn sales market continues to be smooth, with purchases mainly from the Yunnan and Guangdong gangs, leading to a slight sense of stability. According to the market in the afternoon, there are 1,650 bales of yarn arriving this month. It is said that these goods are temporarily taken in by the exchange, but it is not known how this will turn out. Gold Rooster has fallen by half a yuan recently.</p>
<p>At the opening of the labeled yarn market, although American cotton rose, it had already risen on the previous day, so the atmosphere in the market was calm. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and each month fell by 2, 3, 4, and 6 jiao. The afternoon opening market situation was still weak. Up to the second and third bids, it was heard that the spot yarn transaction demand in the south was still smooth, and it was also said that there might be a solution for the yarn arriving this month, which made the market slightly firmer. Each month rose by 1 or 2 jiao. The full-day transaction statistics totaled 27,050 bales. The sales were Hengyi 700 bales, Jifeng 350 bales, Changyu 650 bales, Yida 950 bales, Yuan Yi 1,000 bales, Yuantai 450 bales, Taichang 800 bales, Dachang 450 bales, Gengfeng 700 bales, Xiesheng 500 bales, and Yongda 550 bales.

<p>New Cotton Appears on the Market</p>
<p>The Futures Cotton Market Atmosphere is Calm</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm. Although American cotton has rebounded by over ten points, the sentiment in this area has turned flat, because it had already risen by three or four jiao on the previous day, and the atmosphere has dispersed. At present, when new cotton is gradually appearing on the market, the seller's intentions are more settled, but a certain cotton firm's large amount has not moved. However, continuous rain, if prolonged, will be unfavorable to cotton harvesting.</p>
<p>There are Slight Discrepancies in Labeled Cotton</p>
<p>At the opening of the labeled cotton market, the weather was bad, and foreign cotton also rose. The situation in the market did not seem tense, mainly because it had already risen by several jiao on the previous day, and there was a lack of buyers. In addition, with new cotton currently appearing on the market, the short-sellers' mood was stable. As a result, near months rose by 5 fen, while far months were flat. There were no major changes in the afternoon, with the near months remaining flat and the far months rising by 5 fen. The full-day transaction statistics totaled 69,200 dan. The sales were Hengde 2,100 dan, Jinchang 1,400 dan, Junchang 1,000 dan, Renfeng 2,700 dan, Changfeng 3,700 dan, Xiecheng 1,300 dan, Xiesheng 1,200 dan, Changhe 3,400 dan, and Runkang 4,200 dan.

<p>Spot Cotton Arrives Gradually, Becoming Stronger</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales remained cold. The source of Yao cotton was about 3,100 bales, and Tong cotton was over 420 bales. The opening price of Yao cotton was 31.2 to 31.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 4090; Shenxin Factory Purchases: 400 pieces; Spot Goods Sent to Factory</p>
<p>American Cotton Rebounds Slightly Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was quiet and firm due to a lack of sellers, industry purchases, and short covering. As a result, spot goods rose by ten points, and futures rose by twelve to fourteen points. The English cotton futures price did not move. Indian cotton initially weakened due to a large number of bulls closing positions and speculative sales, but later rebounded slightly due to purchases by Japanese merchants and European exporters. As a result, both Pingguo Er and Aomula and Bailuoxi fell by two rupees. The original telegraph is recorded on the left (11th telegraph).</p>

<p>The Futures Flour and Wheat Market is Quiet and Stable</p>
<p>---The Market Situation is Fluctuating, and There are Not Many Transactions---</p>
<p>After the flour market opened this morning, the market for each month generally presented a stable appearance. With the quotations for foreign wheat, Chicago rebounded by about 2 or 3 jiao, and Canada rose by 1 to 3 jiao. Therefore, after the opening price, the market for each month had stabilized, about 1 fen better than the closing price on the previous day. However, at a time when the country is suffering from water and drought disasters, the destruction of rural areas is increasing day by day. As a result, the daily purchasing power is also decreasing. Therefore, although the weather is getting light rain, people's hearts seem more relaxed, but the market value is already low, so the entry and exit of the exchange market are rare. When the afternoon market opened, transactions became even more sluggish. Both the trading parties were watching each other. The mainland gang stopped due to rain, and the guest gang waited quietly because the departure was not smooth. Therefore, there was little fluctuation up and down. As a result, this month fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li, October and November fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li, December rose by 0.5 fen, and January and February fell by 1 fen.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened this morning, the market for each month had stabilized. The quotations for foreign wheat have all rebounded by about 1, 2, and 3 jiao. Therefore, the opening price for each month had a profit, about 2 or 3 fen better than the previous day. However, with the light rain in the world, the buying interest inside and outside the industry stopped. Transactions in each month were lonely, and there were many empty bids. When the afternoon market opened, transactions were relatively active, but mainland bulls were coming out, so in the fluctuation, it was slightly weaker. As a result, this month was better by 1 fen, October was slightly lower by 1 fen, November and December were better by 1 fen, and January was better by 2 fen. The spot wheat market has slightly turned stable and profitable. Because customers are tightening, factories are dealing, high goods are shouting high by 5 fen, medium and sub-grades are flat, and 5,000 packages of Shandong Xuzhou wheat are opened at 3 yuan and 6 jiao half, and sub-grade 5 jiao and 6 fen. Bengbu wheat 3 yuan and 6 jiao, sub-grade 5 jiao and 6 fen. Yingzhou wheat 3 yuan and 6 jiao half, Yaowan wheat 3 yuan and 6 jiao. It is estimated that Fuxin handled it.</p>
<p>The Yellow Bean Market is Fluctuating</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no major change in the new and old yellow beans. Regarding the quality of the new beans, the sales are in the hands of the Tongzhou gang and this street. The total transaction of each bean was 7 to 8 carts, including Zhengyangguan beans 2 carts, priced from 3 yuan, 3 jiao 4 to 2 jiao half, Yingzhou beans 4 carts, priced from 2 yuan, 8 jiao half to 8 jiao, Bengbu beans 1 cart, priced at 2 yuan, 6 jiao half, Guide beans 300 bags, priced at 3 yuan, and Hankou Xinyangzhou beans opened at 2 yuan, 6 jiao, and 300 bags were handled by the Jiangbei gang. The new beans</p>
<h3>He Buys a Shoe (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>In an instant, the wooden leg was snatched away, and the copper coins in his hand became his weapon. Glimpses of his past bravery flashed before his eyes. Accustomed to fighting, he was as excited as an enraged cricket, poised and ready. He suddenly stood up and lunged forward, but lost his balance and fell.</p>
<p>A policeman, like a statue with a fixed pose, emerged from the crowd, pushing aside the onlookers who were craning their necks, sticking out their tongues, and muttering criticisms, and indifferently shouted:</p>
<p>"What's going on? Fighting?..." He dutifully dragged the still-fist-swinging soldier up, his eyes scanning the surroundings.</p>
<p>The shop owner immediately turned around, his hands hanging down properly, and put on a polite demeanor:</p>
<p>"Ah, Officer, we businessmen value fair trade. Shoes must be bought in pairs. If everyone only buys one, we won't even be able to pay our taxes. This gentleman here... Even if he's from the 19th Route Army, let alone the 29th, I'm afraid I have to say no..."</p>
<p>"..." The policeman, uninterested, took off his hat and played with it, yawned, then furrowed his brows and said loudly, "We'll sort it out at the station. Go!"</p>
<p>The soldier, with curious yet disdainful eyes, tightly closed his wide mouth, supported himself with the wooden leg, and stood up. He caught sight of the paper box and, with the posture of a cat catching a mouse, reached out and grabbed it.</p>
<p>"Go to the station? That's fine. I haven't met your station chief yet." The soldier gave a cold smile. "Have I broken the law? What law? I don't understand. I only have one leg. I gave the other one to my dear compatriots. Asking you to give me a shoe is too much, but why can't I even buy one myself?"</p>
<p>The policeman faithfully carried out his duties, gesturing with two fingers to guide the chubby shop owner in autumn velvet trousers and the one-legged soldier ahead. The three mismatched figures limped towards the Yonghan South Road and the Yonghan Branch Bureau, gradually fading into the dusk.</p>
<p>The onlookers dispersed, seemingly satisfied. Only two or three rickshaw pullers and some wandering children curiously and furtively followed the three characters who looked like performers in a slapstick play.</p>
<h3>On the Road</h3>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter One: A Ghost Carries a Cart of Distant Guests from Guanzhong; A Family with Only Four Walls; A Ferry Crossing Laments Qin People</p>
<p>Apart from Li Shilian, even the chauffeur knows a little about the story of the Zhou and Qin dynasties. Pondering it, everyone feels that although Qin Shi Huang was a tyrant, his courage was truly great, and so they unanimously praised him. As they spoke, the tires suddenly went flat. The chauffeur got out to pump them up, and everyone else got out to stretch their legs. Beside the road was a fortress, and an old man with a white beard leaned against the fortress gate, sitting on the ground. Secretary Chang walked up and said: Old man, what's this place called? The old man said: This is an empty stockade, there's no water to drink. As he spoke, he leaned on the wall and stood up tremulously. He was probably deaf, as his answer didn't match the question. Cheng Zhiqian, precisely because it was an empty fortress, wanted to go inside and take a look. So, he walked ahead, venturing into the fortress gate. The fortress had neat earthen walls, but the gate was just an earthen hole, without a single piece of wood left. Inside the fortress was a straight road, with houses on both sides. However, all the houses were empty, with only four walls. People had haphazardly enclosed some land between the walls to plant some grain. At the center of the fortress was a crossroads, and looking around, all four directions were a jumble of earthen walls. Not only was there no sign of anyone, but not even the sound of human voices could be heard. In the gaps of the low walls, there was a whole cluster of green grass, and two yellow-haired, long-eared rabbits scurried away at the sound of strangers' voices. Secretary Chang said: Without these two small creatures, it would be fine, but with these two small creatures, it feels even more desolate. Speaking of which, this is the ancient capital of Qin Shi Huang, we descendants are truly ashamed. As he spoke, he turned his head and looked around. Cheng Zhiqian said: It's still the same saying, heaven does it, what can we say? At this time, Li Shilian also felt a stirring inside, and asked: Secretary Chang, although there are no people living in this fortress, the land is still being cultivated, so the common people must still be nearby. Are there any district chiefs or fortress chiefs? Secretary Chang said: Probably? Li Shilian said: If there are fortress chiefs, then it's alright, even if the fortress is more desolate. Cheng Zhiqian said: What do you mean by that, Mr. Li? Can a fortress chief relieve the famine? Li Shilian said: No, you see, the entire village is deserted, how will the government collect taxes? With a fortress chief, that doesn't matter. Find the fortress chief, and hold him responsible, and the taxes will naturally be collected. Everyone was stunned to hear his invention! (18)</p>
<h3>Rickshaw</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>I say: "The rickshaw in inland China is the vanguard of material civilization. Wherever there are rickshaws, all the new constructions and new supplies of the city are gradually transported over."</p>
<p>However, in Japan, the birthplace of the rickshaw, it is gradually decreasing due to the extreme development of other means of transportation. According to people from Japan, the fare for rickshaws there is sometimes even more expensive than for automobiles.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai-Suzhou area, rickshaws are called "yellow bag cars," probably because their color is yellow. On the Jinpu Railway across the Yangtze River, the rickshaws at each station are all black, so they are called "foreign cars," which is an abbreviation of "Eastern foreign cars." I remember that Suzhou also used to call them "Eastern foreign cars" many years ago. The term "Eastern foreign car" has been found in Mr. Wang Renqiu's "Xiangqi Building Diary," which says, "Yuanqing sent an Eastern foreign car, it seems very bumpy, because it's a strange car, I dare not ride it." That year was the sixth year of the Guangxu reign (1880), and Mr. Wang was a superintendent of education in Chengdu. Mr. Wang was used to riding in mule carts and two-handed carts, so he thought rickshaws were strange cars, but what was so strange about them? It also shows that he had a bit of a skeptical attitude towards emerging things. This was a chronic ailment of the literati and officials at the time, so it's no wonder that Li Chunkui opposed the construction of railways. But later, when Mr. Wang, with his small braid, took Zhou Ma to the old capital to meet Yuan Xiangcheng, what were his thoughts on the proliferation of rickshaws? I wonder if he ever tried this strange car?</p>
<p>Those who sing the high tune of humanitarianism think that riding in a rickshaw is inhumane, but in places where other means of transportation are not yet available, one cannot but ride in a rickshaw. Moreover, in China, where the livelihood of coolies is extremely difficult today, rickshaws have also relieved the hunger and cold of many people. Therefore, the Nanjing municipal government specially raised the fares of public buses to allow rickshaws to gain more patrons. To be honest, aren't they supporting rickshaws?</p>
<p>Privately owned rickshaws are most exquisite and prestigious in Suzhou; they are most reserved in Shanghai, but there is a kind of northern style, with a white cloth canopy and brass ornaments, which has a unique style and is very different from the Suzhou cars with embroidered cushions and carbide lamps. Just from this point, there is also a distinction between fortitude and gentleness.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xu Jie)</p>
<p>The earth is a speck in space, man is a speck in the earth, so tiny that one can ignore it, what do gains and losses, honor and disgrace, matter to the heart?</p>
<p>All things begin from a point: a spore can become a tree of great size; a sperm can grow into a wise person; electrons and atoms are the mothers of all things: a point is truly the ancestor of the universe!</p>
<p>Points are gathered to form lines, lines are gathered to form surfaces, surfaces are gathered to form bodies, objects also originate from a point.</p>
<h3>Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>If we were to strictly investigate, the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu years (1894-1895), which caused China to suffer a great defeat and led to the handing over of the entire Korea to Japan, that humiliation, Yuan Shikai could indeed be directly listed as one of the culprits. The truth is this: he was originally a person of extreme impatience, especially fond of showing off his authority. He wished he could execute all the dissatisfied people with a wave of his hand. Unfortunately, the court did not understand this personality of his. When an emergency occurred in Korea, both China and Japan showed a tense state of affairs, but the court still wanted to strive to eliminate the war; therefore, it sent Yuan Shikai to Korea to mediate, hoping that he would be a flexible diplomat, using some clever means to negotiate with the Japanese and temporarily resolve various difficult issues. This, of course, also included the implication that China had no intention of fighting for the time being. Unexpectedly, after Yuan Shikai arrived in Korea, he acted solely on emotion, greatly offending the Japanese side; just at that time, the Japanese were no different from a newly emerged tiger cub, eager to find an opportunity to test their own military strength. Thus, they immediately issued an ultimatum and formally declared war on China. Thus, the history of China's national humiliation also began at the same time! What's even more ridiculous is that although the outcome of this incident was so bad, Yuan Shikai himself became famous instead. (Translator's note: This passage may not be consistent with the facts.)</p>
<p>In addition to this matter, Yuan Shikai also had a proud masterpiece in his life, which can also be regarded as his work of fame. This matter was not of great importance to the entire China; but the relationship with the Manchu government was indeed not small. If someone were to put it on the stage, it would surely be a tragedy that could be sung, wept, sighed, and hated. To narrate this incident, it is necessary to first discuss Yuan Shikai's character in detail. (127)</p>
<h3>Crab Trap</h3>
<p>— Yu Mengwo</p>
<p>The night has fallen into a deep sleep, and a gentle breeze blows from the river, causing slight ripples on the clear, still surface. Tiny stars twinkle scattered, and the moon is still hiding in the clouds, not yet emerging. I wander alone on the riverbank: appreciating and pursuing the autumn night of nature.</p>
<p>From the distant rustling reeds, several clear flute sounds are sent out intermittently with the wind; the dim light on the fishing boat is reflected on the green waves, flickering like falling stars in the sky.</p>
<p>Everything on this riverbank is so beautiful and full of poetry!</p>
<p>— Moon</p>
<p>The crab trap, woven from bamboo, is like a Great Wall around the heart of the river: the crab catchers, using their wisdom, set down a trap-like crab trap, light up bright lanterns, and wait for their target—the crab—to come, to repay the price of their laborious management.</p>
<p>The stupid crabs, unaware of the treachery of mankind, mistake the path of light, leading them to their doom without realizing it, how pitiful!</p>
<p>But, aren't the people in society also like this?</p>
<h3>The Dried-Up West Lake</h3>
<p>— (He Haisheng)</p>
<p>Heaven is not giving any rain, and Hangzhou has already had a severe drought for three months, so there is a water shortage recently. The salinity of the tap water is too high, and cooking tea and rice has a salty taste, making it difficult to swallow.</p>
<p>The beautiful West Lake is also gradually drying up, with water only in the deep center, and the shallow areas are already full of exposed mud. If you go to the Crane Releasing Pavilion on Gushan, you can already see the bridge piers of the West Lake Exposition Bridge. As for the fragrant and delicate lotus flowers, without the nourishment of the lake water, they are bare and planted in the mud, swaying in the wind, showing a haggard color.</p>
<p>There are still boats in the lake, but only two or three. Those melon-peel skiffs are all gathered on the shore, and the boatmen and women are sighing, complaining that heaven is not giving rain and cutting off their livelihoods.</p>
<p>The West Lake is dried up, and there is an even greater lack of drinking water, so wealthy people are driving to Hupao to fetch water, like the Shan Yin Road, but what will happen when the spring water is exhausted and there is not a drop left?</p>
<p>Local Chronicles</p>
<h3>The City Outside the County Seat of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Press Agency</p>
<p>The establishment of Shanghai County began in the twenty-ninth year of the Yuan Dynasty under Emperor Shizu, while the construction of the county seat began in the thirty-second year of the Ming Dynasty under Emperor Shizong. However, before the construction of the county seat, there were already many ancient cities within Shanghai's borders. However, due to their age and the lack of surviving sites, people rarely pay attention to them.</p>
<p>According to old records and research, the oldest walled city within Shanghai's borders is considered to be Helü City. The Geography of the Book of Han notes: "Lou County has Nanwu City, built by Helü to defend against Yue." The Taiping Huanyu Ji and the Supplement to the Wujun Tujing both say: "Thirty li east of Yuan Song's city, there are also two cities facing each other across the river, built by Helü to defend against Yue." The Shaoxi Yunjian Zhi quotes the above two sayings as one of the famous sites of Yunjian. Regarding the location of the city site, the Daqing Yitong Zhi says: "Nanwu City is sixty-five li southeast of Shanghai County, also known as Helü City," and the Huangchao Tongzhi believes it is sixty-five li south of Huating County, while the Jiaqing Shanghai County Zhi directly points out that Helü City is in the twenty-seventh bao of Shanghai. Except for the location indicated by the Tongzhi, which is more difficult to believe, according to the Taiping Huanyu Ji, the city site should be in the Yangjing district of Pudong, or even in the territory of Nanhui County; according to the Daqing Yitong Zhi, it should be southeast of Zhoupu; according to the Jiaqing County Zhi, it should be in the current territory of Gaochang, Caojing, and Fahua districts. As for its exact location, it is of course not easy to determine because more than two thousand years have passed and records from the Han and Tang dynasties are extremely lacking. However, the Supplement to the Wujun Tujing believes that the city was originally built to defend the sea route, so the credibility of what the Taiping Huanyu Ji says is naturally slightly higher.</p>
<p>The Hudu Fortress, commonly known as Luzi City, is written as Yuan Song's City in the Taiping Huanyu Ji, and as Yuan Shan Song's City in the Wu Di Ji and the Supplement to the Wujun Tujing. The Shaoxi Yunjian Zhi states that "on the side of the Hudu River, there used to be two cities, east and west. The east city was more than 10,000 bu wide and had four gates. Today, it has moved into the river. The west city is extremely small and is located northwest of the east city." According to the Biography of Yu Tan in the Jin Shu, Tan was the Prefect of Wu during the Yonghe period of Emperor Cheng, and due to famine and war, he repaired the Hudu Fortress to defend against sea bandits. Also, in the winter of the fourth year of the Long'an period of Emperor An of Jin, the Wu Prefect Yuan Shansong built the Hudu Fortress to defend against Sun En. The following year, En advanced from Gouyan and captured Hudu, and Song was killed. From this, it can be seen that the construction of the city was even before the Jin Dynasty. Later, due to erosion by the river, it was slightly damaged by the Tang Dynasty. By the Song Dynasty, it was half-destroyed in the river. During the Shaoxi period, only the southwest corner of the east city remained. There were still traces to visit in the Yuan and Ming dynasties. In the early Qing Dynasty, it had long become a level shoal on both banks, and the old traces were completely submerged. However, the water of the two Luzi Rivers beside the fortress still flowed north into the Wusong River. Since Shanghai opened up concessions, foreigners have filled rivers and built roads, and even the two Luzi Rivers have become intermittent and remnant ditches. According to the current address, the location of the east and west cities should be east of Xiaoshadu Road in the western district of the public concession, within the area south of the Sun Temple in Zhabei.</p>
<p>In addition to repairing the Hudu Fortress, Yuan Shansong also built a small city seven chi high and three hundred bu in circumference thirty-five li east of Huating County. The Tongzhi calls it Yuan Gong City, and the Daqing Yitong Zhi calls it Zhuye City according to the old name of Yunjian Zhi. The meaning of the two words "Zhuye" is no longer known, and the locals call both the city and the Yuan Shansong Temple east of the city the Zhuye General Temple. Today, the temple remains, but the city does not. It is located near Shagang in the Minhang district of Shanghai County.</p>
<p>The above five cities were all built before Shanghai County was established. During the Ming Dynasty, three fortress cities were built to defend against the invasion of Japanese pirates. Today, the two fortresses of Nanhui and Chuansha are under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County and Chuansha County, respectively, while the Baoshan Fortress City in the Gaoqiao district has also been submerged in the sea and cannot be traced. In the early Qing Dynasty, the Minister of War, Su Yi, patrolled the coastal areas and requested in a memorial in the seventeenth year of the Shunzhi reign to build an earthen city on the north bank of the Donggou of the Huangpu River, called the Zhai City. Government offices and barracks were set up inside, and a considerable force was stationed there to guard against the invasion of pirates. Later, because there was no trouble on the sea frontier, the earthen city soon collapsed and was not rebuilt. The garrisoned soldiers were also completely dismissed. Today, only those familiar with local anecdotes know that there was once an earthen city in that place.</p>

<h3>Objective Environment</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>For any problem, I must first think of a concrete or abstract solution before I dare to talk about it or start working on it. This is my personality, that is, my lack of knowledge and adventurousness.</p>
<p>I have the same attitude towards the problem of the mass language, so the first opinion I published on the mass language was to "discuss a smaller problem, should we discuss it separately or merge it?" My meaning is; since the mass language has been promoted, (1) we should first think about the organization and production methods of the mass language, (2) how to sell it to the masses? Regarding these two propositions, the former advocates using one dialect as the standard, because the Beijing dialect is more common and easier to implement, so assuming the use of Beijing language, the latter, the current masses, are mostly illiterate, so we should start with universal education first. Since universal education cannot be expected from the government, only the general intellectuals - those who claim to be representatives - should automatically take the lead in doing this work. These are some of the opinions I contributed in the article "A Smaller Problem."</p>
<p>But recently, I have seen and received (mostly with abuse and talking about things outside the problem, the supplement of this newspaper generally does not publish) texts opposing me, mostly talking about empty theories without regard to facts, or even talking about things outside the problem. Therefore, I cannot help but be a little more presumptuous and straightforward in my speech, and I have offended many gentlemen who advocate the mass language, which I deeply regret. However, for some writers who are unreasonably troublemaking, or mocking and abusive, I can only deal with them with an "unceremonious" attitude.</p>
<p>In fact, my words seem to be "anti-mass," but my propositions are all based on the true position of the mass language, and the writers who advocate the mass language are speaking from the objective environment. From the ordinary perspective, there is naturally a big gap between them. Although the propositions are different, the major premise is that they are all seeking the interests of the masses and seeking happiness for the masses, which I think there is not much difference. Or perhaps the "anti-mass" - this newspaper is not anti-mass, because people say we are anti-mass - the propositions are still more practical and more concrete.</p>
<p>Naturally, a newspaper should accommodate opinions from all sides and discuss the core of the problem thoroughly to find a solution, the supplement of this newspaper originally held this attitude, but this newspaper publishes more "anti-mass" - texts, and publishes fewer texts advocating the mass language, because among the submissions, abusive, boring, and texts talking about things outside the problem account for the majority. To save a lot of trouble, we have put these texts aside, which is not any prejudice. This is the absolute attitude of this newspaper in advocating open discussion. If there are any insightful opinions, we are very willing to accept them.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Xu's article "Please Look at the Objective Environment" again, which is clearly directed at the article "To a Heartfelt Friend," but that article still does not talk about the core of the problem, and is still a series of empty and impractical arguments. I could have not replied, but to express my personal proposition and announce the attitude of this newspaper, I have to explain it again.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's topic is "Please Look at the Objective Environment," and the first sentence I have to declare is that we are now deeply in the middle of the environment, so there is no need to look at the environment again, especially the objective environment. Mr. Xu also said:</p>
<p>"The mass language is related to all problems of the masses, it is not simply a language reform movement,</p>
<p>It is a movement within the entire mass life improvement movement,"</p>
<p>I have long understood this intention. Simply put, it is to transform the environment of the masses, but to transform the environment of the masses, it is already very weak to rely solely on the language movement, and the language movement, without going to actual work, only speaks empty and pleasant words, it is still a set of "empty city tactics," how can people not be anxious?

<h3>Black Current</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>As long as the foreman, Li Changmazi, went to the street corner to joke with the porridge-selling girl, everyone felt like prisoners released, taking a breath, bending their legs, and even the movement of blood slowed down.</p>
<p>"Grandma, we're really like oxen!" Little Scabby threw the iron bar on the ground, thumped his own broad chest, and was the first to speak, his eyes secretly fixed on the street corner.</p>
<p>"Oxen, hey, oxen even get fed grass."</p>
<p>"I'd rather be an animal. No wife, no children, no home."</p>
<p>"Who says it's not better to be an animal? That foreign chief engineer's hunting dog eats a big silver dollar's worth of beef a day!"</p>
<p>As long as someone starts the conversation, everyone will join in, one sentence after another, endlessly.</p>
<p>The roller compressor rested by the curb, constantly emitting steam, waiting for the special machine to exert its power, to suppress the rising flames of the underground layer until it was flat. Layer upon layer of hot asphalt solution was poured on.</p>
<p>Large chunks of asphalt were thrown into an iron pot, and countless intense flames licked the bottom of the pot, melting it. Black smoke, carrying a foul odor, filled the air above the road. Those standing by the asphalt pot, pouring the asphalt solution, dragging the hot rolling drum, and the driver of the roller compressor, all had dark, glossy faces.</p>
<p>"Ready to pour!"</p>
<p>Then a large bucket of hot black solution was poured out, shimmering silver in the sun. Several laborers used brooms to spread the solution, extending it to the unpaved areas. A black current!</p>
<p>The people living in the black current were forever subjected to the heat of the fire and the roar of the roller compressor.</p>
<p>The one dragging the roller walked on the molten current covered with only a layer of yellow sand, exerting all his strength to flatten the road surface. The hot air rose from his feet straight to his chest, throat, and head, causing a dizzy spell. Then he heard Li Changmazi's venomous scolding: "Hey! Grandma, at this rate, you might as well 'go to heaven' sooner!"</p>
<p>The large buckle was pressed on his shoulder by the thick hemp rope, feeling like a thousand pounds of weight. The tendons in his neck bulged, and blood vessels were stretched taut all around. His feet felt like they were on a hot iron, burning to his heart. "Grandma, if only I had a pair of ox-hoof-like feet, a horse-neck-like neck. I can't take it."</p>
<p>"Who can take it? We're all living on a volcano, for a few cents." Zhang Banlai took a long breath. His body wasn't strong, and he leaned lazily in the crowd, moaning, "Oh yo lai oh yo, oh yo…"</p>
<p>Everyone moaned:</p>
<p>"Oh yo lai oh yo, oh yo…"</p>
<p>When the roller compressor started moving, the second bucket of asphalt was melting in the iron pot.</p>
<p>The roller compressor, with its bulging belly, struggled to climb past. The second bucket of asphalt solution was poured down. While those working on the edge of the black current could barely breathe, Li Changmazi at the street corner was joking with the porridge-selling girl, also breathless with laughter.</p>
<p>"He's also human! He has the leisure to tease girls." Someone said in the misty smoke.</p>
<p>"Shameless, relying entirely on the foreign devils, sucking up to them, and lording it over us!" The old Shandong man pushing the roller had a quick tongue and always worried others.</p>
<p>"Old fellow, watch your words!" Little Scabby threw coal into the stove while gesturing to him with his mouth.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>"Grandma, whoever is a traitor, we'll beat him!" The old Shandong man was unconvinced, but, but...</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a block of asphalt surged over his back, and his feet felt like they were stabbed with dozens of knives, causing him to fall with a piercing scream of "Ah!" His whole body lay on the hot asphalt solution! Everyone used sticks to drag him to a place without asphalt. Everyone's hearts were burning, almost scorched.</p>
<p>The old Shandong man died at that moment, his body black, scorched, and rotten like roasted pork. The troublemaker had long escaped. The foreman, Li Changmazi, scolded all the living, pushing aside the onlookers to make a phone call to the authorities and the Public Works Department. "Damn it, you bunch of bastards, go die! You've gotten me into trouble."</p>
<p>But the third bucket of asphalt was already melting in the iron pot.</p>
<h3>Street Urchin</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Every morning and at five o'clock in the afternoon, a sharp and familiar sound came from the alley:</p>
<p>"Shen Bao - Xin Wen Bao..."</p>
<p>This was the cry of the one the people in the alley called "Little Monkey." He was probably twelve or thirteen years old? He himself wasn't sure. At the same time, he didn't know his own name. His appearance did resemble a monkey, as he was an undernourished and orphaned street urchin! A pair of sunken eyes was embedded in a dark, gaunt face, barely showing a pair of arched eyes. He wore a sleeveless blue cloth shirt and a pair of striped cloth pants, splattered with mud and oil stains, having lost their original color. Whenever the young ladies in the alley met him, they would always cover their noses with small handkerchiefs, or even turn their faces away and spit on the ground.</p>
<p>Was it last winter? The northwest wind howled, and no one lingered in the alley. Children and adults were all inside their houses, telling stories around coal stoves. Only Sister-in-law Er, who went to work at the yarn factory every morning, often saw him wrapped in two burlap sacks, wearing a skullcap without a top, holding an iron hoop in one hand and carrying a broken bamboo basket in the other, standing by the garbage bin picking up scrap paper and rags, looking at people with timid, pale eyes.</p>
<p>One day, Sister-in-law Er felt very sorry for him and gave him a bowl of cold rice. From then on, every time he came to the alley, he would stand and linger at the back door of Sister-in-law Er's house, waiting for Sister-in-law Er to give him a bowl of rice before slowly leaving the alley.</p>
<p>Time passed, and he went from the howling cold wind to this mild spring. His hands and feet turned from red and swollen to dry, firewood-like chips.</p>
<p>It was almost dusk now—</p>
<p>"Xin Ye Bao - Da Mei Evening News..."</p>
<p>The sound was heard again in the alley as usual. In the dim twilight, he stretched his voice and cried out again and again.</p>
<p>However, recently, this sharp and familiar cry has not been heard for quite some time. Whenever there is a silent dusk, I remember Little Monkey. Alas, where has this homeless wanderer drifted to now?</p>
<p>But some people say that the alley has been quiet and easy to sleep in these past few nights, without the strange voice of that Little Monkey!</p>
<h3>Sleepless Night</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>After the waning night, the surroundings were a quiet and beautiful world, without a single sound. All sounds had sunk into the black countryside of night. Happy people had long entered sweet dreams, intoxicated in blissful dreams.</p>
<p>But even this blessing I couldn't enjoy.</p>
<p>Like a ghost possessing me, I felt an unprecedented disturbance and agitation. I don't know how many thousands of times I tossed and turned, nothing felt right. Although my eyes were tightly closed, my nerves refused to rest, deliberately obstructing and working. The more I tossed and turned, the more excited I became, and the clearer my thoughts. Memory picked out everything brightly, even some old events that had faded in the past and the sorrows that I feared to arouse all swarmed like ants into my brain.</p>
<p>It was really impossible to sleep anymore. Damn it, I cursed unconsciously. Then I relentlessly pounded on the bed board and grabbed my hair, hoping to exhaust myself as much as possible, so that my body and mind would slowly become drowsy and fall asleep from a gradual daze. But all was in vain. Moving my hands and feet only resulted in a sweat and wasted my energy. The god of sleep still didn't come, and my nerves were still just as clear, not feeling tired at all.</p>
<p>Ought to hate the god of sleep!</p>
<p>I deeply felt that the pain of insomnia was more severe than the pain of heartbreak.</p>
<p>My eyelids were indeed tired to death, and it was very difficult to open them. However, my mind was becoming clearer. What to do? I tried all kinds of methods, but none worked. The clock on the table had struck three times. It was a summer night, and the sun rose especially early. Looking at the sky, it was almost dawn. I tried every way to sleep, but none were effective.</p>
<p>So I didn't sleep anymore. Anyway, I couldn't sleep no matter what. I simply slipped out of bed, turned on the light, lit a cigarette, and paced to the window.</p>
<p>I stood there blankly, rubbing my sleepy eyes. Looking at the sky, the moon had already set. Only a few stars remained, dotting the blue sky listlessly. Suddenly, a cold wind blew over me, causing me to shiver several times, and goosebumps rose on my skin. At the same time, this wind brought a desolate feeling like the lonely night scene, and a desolate tremor immediately surged in my heart. I felt as if I had been abandoned by everything, a similar sadness.</p>
<p>To encounter the same experiences as the unfortunate in the world, these days I have left my family and wandered far away in a foreign land, gritting my teeth to live a poor life. These long days are drowning in the melancholy of lost laughter. The thick dust of life and the heavy clouds of sorrow, lamenting human affairs and personal circumstances, cover my thoughts and my soul like a fog. Because of excessive worry, I have insomnia. And the weight of worry can never be reduced, so the insomnia becomes heavier day by day as the worry increases. Even if worry doesn't break my body, this insomnia is enough to overwhelm a weak life. I haven't had any kind of palpitations because of this, anyway, living is not interesting, and this world will not give me any complete gift. Let the demons of life ravage me at will.</p>
<h3>Zheng Xiaoxu and his ilk's so-called "Manchurian Paradise"</h3>
<h3>Garret Writer</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Like a pigeon coop, the width of the room wasn't even five feet wide. Putting in two beds and two writing desks, all the space was almost completely occupied. If there were three or five visitors, there was simply no room to stand. It was easy to get through the freezing winter, but once the sweltering summer arrived, life became unbearable. The one window, already as small as it could be, faced west. From the afternoon onwards, the intense sun shone into the room, like a furnace, constantly evaporating waves of suffocating heat. Hiding inside was like being a wonton in a steamer. Large beads of sweat flowed non-stop.</p>
<p>Two fellows lived in this kind of place.</p>
<p>—Where do you live now?—</p>
<p>Whenever someone asked, they all seemed to agree not to answer. If you asked again, "Still in a garret?"</p>
<p>—Of course. If it's not a garret, is it a Western-style house?</p>
<p>The reply had some indignation and sadness in its tone. But this was their usual attitude. A nonchalant smile still floated on their faces.</p>
<p>Living a miserable life forever cramped in a garret, sometimes when they thought about it, they couldn't help but feel sad. But this sadness was usually very brief, and they forgot about it again in no time. In fact, each of them had a not-insignificant income, and it certainly wasn't impossible to rent a more comfortable house. But it was always like this: as soon as they got their money, they spent their days gallivanting around, drinking, dancing, and going to cafes, indulging themselves to the fullest. In just a few days, they would lightly spend all the fruits of their month's hard work.</p>
<p>On the last night before the money ran out, the sky was about to dawn. They dragged their listless feet out of the dance hall. Stumbling along the sidewalk in the middle of the night, like ghosts.</p>
<p>The night wind blew coldly, seemingly clearing up their dazed nerves a bit. One of them said:</p>
<p>—It's really impossible to go on messing around like this. A gallivanting life can only produce some worthless gallivanting things. Upright articles can't be written. In a few days, I'm afraid I won't even be able to write this. It's really like ruining myself. I think I need to be serious from now on, bury myself in creation, and write one or two amazing works.</p>
<p>The other one, after hearing this, only glanced at the one who spoke, without saying a word. He also felt the same way in his heart. But he had lost confidence in himself. After a while, he slowly and softly sighed:</p>
<p>—To be able to produce satisfactory works, you must first make life serious. Like this, it's always just a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Chatting a lot doesn't necessarily mean you can do it. From that moment on, the two of them swore not to go out again, closed the door, and buried themselves in writing. But this was also because the money had run out; otherwise, they would still be as dissolute as before. Every day, from morning till night, they sat at their desks, hating the blank sheets of paper. One was preparing to write a novella, and the other was preparing to write a script of tens of thousands of words. But after half a day, they still couldn't write a single line. They racked their brains but couldn't figure out how to start or come up with a satisfactory story. Sheet after sheet of paper was torn up. In the end, they all threw down their pens and helplessly smoked a cigarette.</p>
<p>"What to do? I want to write, but I can't. What to do?"</p>
<p>A gallivanting life can only produce gallivanting things. My brain is twisted."</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>They looked at each other and both sighed deeply for a while.</p>
<p>This sigh actually lasted for several days. And after that, they simply didn't care about anything anymore. They continued to live that kind of disorganized life, becoming more and more decadent. And they desperately wrote some boring manuscripts that couldn't be any more boring. They didn't want to imagine whether the future was bright or dark. They only sought to get through one day at a time. Now, whenever they meet people, they say, "There's no way out for garret writers; we can only continue to decline."</p>

<h3>Uncle's Braid (4)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival that Shi Min had been eagerly awaiting finally passed. Now that he thought about it, everything was quite ordinary except for eating sesame mooncakes that night and the lotus root made into a dragon with red paper. Speaking of that lotus root, Aunt was really extremely clever. She cut the red paper into dragon whiskers and a tail, and then took a few incense sticks from the incense burner, with triangular red flags attached, writing "Peace Under Heaven" and "Abundant Harvest," etc., and inserted them on the dragon's back, how interesting. No one ate the lotus root on Mid-Autumn Night, but it was used to worship the moon all night, until the next morning when Shi Min secretly ate it.</p>
<p>Shi Min did not study this day, from morning to dusk, because his father had been invited to be a "gongqing" (note) for someone, and would usually return very late. He was alone in the garden catching a large grasshopper, and although the grasshopper spat a lot of yellow water on his hands, he was very happy. He came in from the back side door, walked to the back hall, and secretly put the grasshopper on the neck of his aunt, who was embroidering, scaring her to jump up with a loud cry. Then Shi Min laughed and ran away victoriously. He played alone in the garden for a long time, and when he returned to the house, his father had already returned.</p>
<p>Strangely, there were many people gathered in the house, all from the village. Some of them Shi Min recognized, even Uncle Chongyang who had helped harvest rice at home last time was there. There were also some faces that were very familiar, but he couldn't name them. Everyone seemed very excited, not knowing why, as if something had gone wrong. In the middle of them, Shi Min's father was reading the newspaper: Even his mother was listening with rapt attention. Shi Min also squeezed in and out from under other people's arms, wanting to see the pictures he liked in the newspaper. Someone pulled his little braid, how annoying, he turned his head and saw an unfamiliar face smiling at him, he widened his eyes and pursed his lips, expressing his anger, but that person laughed even harder, there was really nothing he could do. The only way was to ignore him and still look over his father's shoulder, watching his father read every word on the newspaper. At this time, he heard Uncle Chongyang talking about the Wuchang Uprising and the restoration of China:</p>
<p>"With this, what else do those Manchus have? You see, it must be the world of the revolutionaries."</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true. You know the revolutionaries, they have few men and horses."</p>
<p>Shi Min didn't recognize who was speaking. But after a while, no one spoke anymore, and everyone quietly listened to his father reading the newspaper, saying:</p>
<p>"It was rumored before the Mid-Autumn Festival that the revolutionaries had launched an uprising in E'yuan. Initially scheduled for the sixteenth, it could not be completed due to strict prevention. It was then changed to the eighteenth, but it was discovered by a secret agent, and more than 20 revolutionaries were captured, and dozens of boxes of explosives were seized. On the nineteenth, they hastily launched an uprising with the new army, and the city was lost due to the small number of soldiers."</p>
<p>Xu Zhai said, pinching his fingers to count:</p>
<p>"Nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second... what's today's date?"</p>
<p>"Today is the twenty-sixth." This was the voice of Grey Hen, not knowing when she had come.</p>
