<p>時評</p>
<h3>防止白銀外流之又一意見</h3>
<p>— 蔭溥</p>
<p>│主張「阻銀流入外行」</p>
<p>自美國採取提高銀價收購現銀之政策以來，世界銀價，日謅堅挺··影響所及，吾國白銀，遂有巨額外流之勢。蓋銀價受人力提高之結果，於同一時間內，其國外漲勢，往往較國內爲高；換言之，即在銀價上漲之過程中，海外銀價，常有較國內銀價，略爲昂貴之趨向。斯時以國內較賤之白銀，運赴國外出售，自頗有利可圖。照最近情形，（二十三年八月下旬，）運銀出口，除一切運費·保險費·木箱費·鎔鑄折耗等一切費用外，尙可獲百分之四至百分之五之純益。（即每運銀百萬元出口，約有四五萬元之盈利可圖。）據統計，本年內，（截至八月二十四日止，）上海白銀出口，總數已達國幣一萬一千一百五十餘萬元之鉅。此項出口現銀，於最近二個月內，實占半數以上；僅八月二十日之一批，已有四千三百餘萬元；其他如厦門等埠，出口之數，尙不在內。於極短時期內，竟有如斯巨額之白銀出口，其爲投機牟利，非爲抵補國際收支，槪可想見。</p>
<p>吾國近數年來，以內地農村破產，國內現銀，原已向都市集中，內地已有現銀枯竭之象。設令都市存銀，更不絕向國外流出，將來內地都市，同感現銀缺乏，則建設於現銀基礎上之金融制度，必將首感困難。蓋銀貨外流，銀底銳减，發行準備，受其限制，在硬幣已缺乏之情况下，更益以紙幣之無法增加，於是通貨不敷，信用收縮：一方因金融緊張，而國內之流動資金，益欠圓滑；他方因隨之而起之物價與匯價跌落，必致產業衰落，外貨充斥，整個國民經濟，因此將陷於絕境。故時賢對於白銀外流之亟宜籌防止方策，倡議頗多。惟因見地各有不同，立論遂難一致。</p>
<p>據余愚見，各方於觀察上及觀念上，似均有根本之錯誤點在，以此所得結論，遂皆不免有不切實際不甚澈底之弊。其觀察上之錯誤點安在？曰，在於將本國金融界之存銀，與外商銀行之存銀，併爲一談，不加分別。其觀念上之錯誤點安在？曰，在於僅謀阻止白銀之外流，而同時不謀避免銀價上漲之不良影響。</p>
<p>請先將關於第一點之事實陳之，外商銀行與本國金融界，平日於往來上雖似交易互通；而於實際上，則早劃疆分治。每日收付，除以劃頭票據抵補外，均須以現銀償淸。設今日有大宗國人存欵，移存外行，於是今日軋算結果，若干現銀，即須流入外行。設明日又有大宗外貨到埠，須付貨價，於是明日軋算結果，若干現銀，又須流入外行。此項大宗現銀，流入外行後，即完全與本國金融市塲，脫離關係，此後不問本國金融市塲，信用緊張至若何程度，現銀需要急切至若何程度，此項已入外行之現銀，則已「侯門一入，」痛癢不關。入美籍銀行者，已爲美國之銀；入英籍銀行者，已爲英國之銀；入德法諸國之銀行者，已爲德法諸國之銀。主權已屬諸他人，來去非我可過問。故愚以爲外行存銀，留滬好，離滬亦好。留滬者留其形；於實質上，於效用上，早已去國萬里，逍遙於倫敦紐約之市。我旣未能刦而奪之，收爲已有，則徒留此白銀軀殻於國土，於我何補？今日之言防止白銀外流者，昧於此點。於是論加徵銀稅，則恐外行運存香港，暫俟機會；論禁銀出口，則憂外行賣與政府，暫作海外存金。且有倡言與美政府接洽，在滬購銀者。一若美政府在滬購銀，其銀仍爲我有者然。試問以美銀暫存上海，與以美銀運赴紐約，實質上效用上有何不同？此各方觀察上根本之錯誤點，似應先加解釋者一。</p>
<p>銀價高漲之影響，對內爲物價之跌落，對外爲匯價之跌落，（意即每一國幣，可多購外幣。）物價跌落，則不景氣漫佈全國，已瀕破產之農業，旣無復興之望；日就衰落之工業，更有崩潰之虞。匯價跌落，則外貨折價，隨之减低；土貨折價，隨之增高。國內則外貨充斥；國外則土貨滯銷。於是內外交困，國民經濟，日就沒落。故防止白銀外流之對策，於防止中應含有壓低國內銀價之作用。否則，外銀上漲，吾人更用人力提高國內銀價，使隨之上漲，在此種情形下，國內外銀價成一平綫，白銀之外流，即或可阻止；然而助白銀漲勢之波瀾，而挺身當此銀漲下不良影響之衡，果何爲者？此論者觀念上根本之錯誤，似應先加解釋者二。</p>
<p>然則欲於避免銀漲影響下阻止白銀外流，策將安出？祗有「阻銀流入外行」之一法。</p>
<p>「阻銀流入外行」之法，其最簡便，最易着手，且已行之見效者，厥惟「匯劃不能收現」之一法。非常之時，當處以非常之法。「匯劃不能收現，」於運用上與停止銀本位事異而實同。停止銀本位，在國際間即成爲「紙幣本位」；「匯劃不能收現」，在國際間即成爲「劃賬本位，」成爲「票據本位。」且事實上吾國今日即欲停止銀本位·不易着手，亦無從着手。蓋吾國發行權尙未集中，紙幣無法編制。一時欲集中之實現，又有事實上種種之困難。則避難就易，似以「匯劃不能收現，」較易推行。　　惟在「劃賬本位，」或「票據本位」下，對內亦有不可不注意之點一：即爲提取存欵，或持鈔兌現，應定有相當限制是也。否則，倘提取存欵，或持鈔兌現，均可無限取得現銀，現銀仍有流入外行之機，恐仍無補於實際。故在實行「匯劃不能收現」之前，似應先爲各本國銀行存銀之登記，公開佈告，以取信於國人；同時於提存（取鈔可無限）兌現，欲取現銀者，規定一相當限制。如此，則以分散之準備，具集中之效用。安見其不能達「阻銀流入外行」之目的耶？</p>
<p>「匯劃不能收現，」始能「阻銀流入外行」；「阻銀流入外行」，無異停止銀本位；停止銀本位，庶能使國內幣值，與國外銀價脫離關係；國內幣値，與國外銀價脫離關係，庶可不受國外銀漲之不良影響。</p>
<p>吾故曰，欲於避免銀漲影響下阻止白銀外流，祗有「阻銀流入外行」之一法；即祗有「匯劃不能收現」之一法。</p>
<p>編者按：自美國提高銀價後，我國白銀洶湧外溢，引起國內銀市之重大恐慌。本市銀行界及經濟學家，鑒於白銀之繼續巨量流出，紛紛討論對策，以資防範。然以此事內容複雜，論者見仁見智，不盡相同。即如上載蔭溥君一文，與本欄昨載次行君「防止白銀外流之有效辦法，」一文，立論頗有所出入，而各有其獨到之見地；因國人注意本問題者多，特爲先後披露，以供比較參考。</p>

<p>飛機派赴哈埠</p>
<p>大美夜報云、今日（二十四日）午後美艦隊旗艦沃格斯太號奉急令由靑島開滬、明日可抵、後並隨驅逐艦兩艘、但此訊未能自官塲方面徵實、今晨上海接滿洲未徵實之消息稱、日政府已派軍艦三十艘、開往大連、並派轟炸飛機七十架、前赴哈爾濱、現信此舉與蘇俄「滿」日間因中東鐵路出售談判發生頓挫、致局勢緊張有密切關係、今晨有以此事訊諸日使署者、據發言人答稱、此說或有一部分確實、因日本海陸軍現正在大連山海關境大操之故、海陸軍大操、飛機自宜參加也、惟該發言人否認軍艦飛機之行動、與俄「滿」間緊張之局勢有何關係、並謂、日本與蘇俄均不準備開戰云、發言人又述及俄日間之齟齬、謂日當局曾於八月十三十四日發覺五站蘇俄軍事委員團圖攻該處日本軍事委員團辦公處之陰謀、日「滿」各報對於此事、皆大書特書、而蘇俄政府未如常時予以否認、又「滿」當局因中東路蘇俄職員曾勾結匪徒毀壞日軍運兵與軍需之火車、特加逮捕、蘇俄政府亦未提出抗議、蘇俄政府對於兩案、皆緘默無言、足爲其自知有過之明證云、</p>

<h3>秋後昨日最熱</h3>
<p>氣溫最高百度</p>
<p>颶風逗留不進</p>
<p>國聞社云、本埠氣候夏季酷熱異常、且滴雨不降、致農事受損、已成災象、一般市民、原冀秋到、俾炎威得以稍殺、詎自入秋以來、不但雨水毫無、而氣溫仍然高漲不退、因之對於四鄕農事、原希一半秋收、又將成爲泡影、昨日記者向本埠天文台探詢所得、則稱昨日氣溫、爲近數日來最熱、計最高爲一百度正、最低爲七十六度一、且天無片雲、氣壓不低、似仍毫無雨象、至於太平洋之颶風、仍繼續不停、向中國沿海岸吹來、則氣溫或可於不久期內轉凉、但自昨日淸晨六時接來報告、颶風已吹至北緯十八度、東經一百三十一度、風向爲西北、惟至午後二時、接獲報告、則又稱停滯不進矣、且查得該颶風風力、並不甚大、故該風是否將吹至沿海岸與氣溫於日內可否轉凉、則一時未能預測云云、</p>

<h3>長江航業不振</h3>
<p>外輪操縱運費</p>
<p>華商大受威脅</p>
<p>聯運無法實現</p>
<p>長江一路、向爲各輪公司最佳航綫、上下水貨最多、六公司經營、年有盈利、但至本年、則來往貨均一落萬丈、加以路航兩局辦理水陸聯運、故該路洋商船、爲未雨綢繆計、乃有狂跌運費、企圖破壞、以致長江營業釀成今日極度不振之現狀、而使平漢聯運、亦受重大阻碍、遲遲不能實現、此事與航業界關係極大、爰將現狀探誌如下、</p>
<p>貨少船多　長江一路、現有招商·三北·寗紹·太古·怡和·日淸·六家、行駛船隻、較一二八前、比較减少五六艘、（指滬漢一段）上海去漢、上水貨、六公司尙取同一步調、不得擅自增跌、但由漢下水貨之運費、則可各自增减、今年因受市面不景起影響、長江上下水貨、均大爲减少、上永船有裝三四成傤脚者、遂感覺船多貨少、怡和乃有將聯和出售、日淸屢欲恢復久停之四輪、乃以無貨可運而止、招商添建兩江輪案、因亦擱置、</p>
<p>外輪跌價　自本年三月分、招商與平漢路、訂定水陸聯運十八條草案後、迄今五越月、日言實行、而迄未實現、惟自此事發生後、行駛長江洋商輪、如太古怡和日淸等、深慮實行後將受重大打擊、下水貨盡變爲聯運、遂不待其實施、而先將長江運滬貨、與長江轉至厦粵各貨水脚、連次减跌、已非一次、迄今甚有將下水貨運價、减至照原價祇收十分之三者、在外商之意、與其無貨放空、無寗跌費濫裝、遂使運費受其擣亂、華輪感其脅迫、行駛上下、無班不損、釀成長江數十年來未有之現狀、</p>
<p>各船虧損　本年各公司長江船、無一可以獲利、在外商以頻年盈利雄厚、公積甚多、虧蝕損失、早已預算、華商江輪、蒙此打擊、殊難持久、現在開行一班、據精密計算、往來十天輪船之各項開支、至少七千元、而平均上下水貨客收入、至多五千元、故行一次須虧一二千元不等、故華輪急待聯運早成、以挽刦運、</p>
<p>妨碍聯運　平漢聯運、路航兩方、雖籌備將竣、但最困難之點、即在運費、按照合同、第五條所訂、聯運水脚、係照各輪公司最低之額訂定、今各外輪已跌到血本之內、致使聯運運費、迄今無法擬定、蓋如照現價收費、則路航雙方、均皆虧本、因之路航當局、對此大費躊踷、據辦理聯運周鳳圖君對記者言、九月十五日、平漢路聯運、能否實現、殊難斷言、蓋運費困難不解决、此事根本無從談起、據周君表示、九月中旬、恐難開辦、至三北寗紹派船問題、亦尙在磋商中</p>

<h3>天時亢旱米價續漲</h3>
<p>社會局擬再議限制米價</p>
<p>日來內地亢旱更甚、榖米價格飛漲、來貨缺乏、本市米價、亦已看高、聞社會局已派員調查、將再召集會議、討論限制米價、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>江北豐收　蘇省本年如臯·通州·淮安·高郵·邵伯·東台·一帶、產米殊豐、價亦低廉、因各地米商紛往購辦、致售價亦因之高漲、近旬來如無錫·蘇州·平望·同里·常熟·等地、亢旱更甚、河水益涸、致稻穗枯萎、因此人心惶惶、購囤防荒、榖價每石已由五元七角漲至六元五角、以榖二石折合米一石、裝運來滬、成本頭號須十四元、來貨亦不旺、</p>
<p>派員調查　前社會局爲穩定米價、曾召集米業團體、商定最高價格、不得超過十三元、然當時因人心恐慌、故表面雖售十三元、暗中均在十三元以上、最高數曾達十三元八角、低亦十三元四角、刻以內地米價高漲、故對限價之十三元成本、已不敷一元餘、故米商亦恐慌異常、曾紛請社會局重訂價格、社會局特於昨晨派四科科員周鳴崗、赴南北市調查、並聞定二十八日開會討論云、</p>
<p>米價續漲　據經售米糧公會會長蔣石稚對新聲社記者稱、當局限價時、西貢市售二百磅僅十元、現已漲至十二元、客秈市斛售八元五角者、業已漲至十一元、照現市頭號正白米缺貨、副號已售十三元三角、粳米正二號售十二元八角、政府威信固應加以維持、惟事實亦須顧到、然此次之高漲、皆因天氣不雨所致、</p>
<p>浙籌救濟　浙省向滬採購湖南蕪湖粳秈及小絞米十萬石後、米價仍挺、故當地米業、仍絡續向滬購辦、每日由滬杭路運往者、平均約五千包、至昨日止、滬米運浙、已有二十萬包、現仍每日購運、近復委托滬米業向西貢訂立期米十萬包、訂期下月在浙交货、</p>
<p>漳米可疑　至於各界疑心之漳米運滬案、據米業界中人謂、東京之圓粒粳米及杜尖、與我國蘇省之粳米尖米相似、幾難分別、非熟於此道者、不易分別、台灣及漳州從來未有米來滬、故其式樣誠難想像、惟新米陳米、則亦易於分別、因新米色靑、而性嫩軟、以手碾之易裂、陳米色純、性乾枯而硬、不易碾裂云云、</p>
<h3>立法委員黃右昌</h3>
<p>草竣商業登記法</p>
<p>已由普陀過滬返京</p>
<p>新聲社云、立法院商法委員會、前推定委員黃右昌、起草商業登記法、並由黃氏來滬、分別向全國商會聯合會及上海市商會、調查商業習慣、並徵詢對於合夥營業連帶負責之補救辦法、調查完竣後、黃氏卽赴普陀起草該項登記法、現草案業已竣事、黃氏於前日由普陀返滬、復赴市商會爲更詳盡之探討、商會方面、亦由常委陳蔗靑、柯幹臣·監委方椒伯·斐雲卿·等儘量貢獻意見、黃氏昨已由滬返京、一俟立法院休會期滿、卽將草案提出討論、</p>

<p>（孔會長辭）開會後、首由會長孔祥熙（羅代）致辭云、諸君、今天本會舉行第六年度半年大會、有這麼多的同志和來賓前來參加、可見諸君對於慈幼事業的興趣和熱心、實在使兄弟心中覺得非常快樂、對於慈幼事業和慈幼恊會的前途、抱着無限的希望、在今年上半年、我們已經有了北平和灤縣兩地的慈幼分會、從今年下半年起、我們又將增加一處分會、那就是南京的慈幼會了、如今上海的人士、以及全國各地的人士、都對於慈幼事業發生甚大的興趣與熱心、只就這一點來說、我們可以確實的相信、中國慈幼事業的成功、是絕對沒有問題的、只不過時間的早晚而已、今天我們在這兒舉行半年大會、一方面要對於過去、作一番週密的檢閱、另一方面、也要對於將來、作一番遠大的展望、我們要根據着過去的已有的一點兒基礎、企圖前途更大的發展與更大的成功、也許我們在過去難免有許多錯誤與失敗的地方、然而我們正可以利用已往錯誤與失敗的經騐、來糾正自己的觀察、來補充自己的計劃、來加强自己的努力、一步一步地向着成功的路上走、我想諸君都還記得、在今年正月間、我們舉行第五屆常年大會的時候、曾經通過了一個所謂中華慈幼恊會五年工作計劃（共有綱目六十項）、頗引起社會上一般人士的相當的注意、與相當的贊許、不過一個計劃是寫在紙面上的、當然還不夠、我們更應該努力的逐漸的、把牠實現起來才對、因此在常年大會閉幕已後、我們就斟酌着本會的僅有的能力、以及社會上的急迫的需要、規定了我們第一年的實施工作、計總務方面、爲（一）召集全國慈幼領袖會議、（二）增設各地慈幼分會、（三）擴大兒童節紀念運動、（四）辦兒童年需用材料、（五）加緊國內外之聯絡與宣傳、（六）敦厚相關團體之恊助與合作、（七）幕集基金、（八）請撥基地、保障方面、爲（一）促成兒童法律、（二）促成兒童法庭、（三）劃區調查童工、（四）杜絕販賣兒童、（五）告發虐待兒童、（六）營救特殊兒童、救濟方面、爲（三）設立感化院、救濟流浪兒童、（二）設立投訴所、救價被迫雛妓、（三）擴充塘山路慈幼教養院、（四）擴充楊樹浦慈幼托兒所、（五）籌設浦東或閘北慈幼托兒所、衛生方面、爲（一）創辦閘北慈幼實騐區、先設慈幼診療所、（二）設立江灣慈幼癆病療養院、（三）試辦南京兒童健樂園、（四）舉行兒童衛生運動、（五）刋行各種保產保嬰及其他衛生圖書、教育方面、爲（一）舉行慈幼演講與播音、（二）推行現代父母月刋、（三）提倡兒童儲蓄、（四）舉行兒童玩具與讀物覽展會、（五）增編父母教育叢書、（六）發行新時代父母與兒童教育之拚圖、統算起來、總共有三十件工作、要在今年民國二十三年進行的、從今年正月起到現在、差不多快近七個月的工夫了、在這七個月中間、有若干的工作、我們是已經舉辦了、還有若干的工作、是正在進行中、更有若干的工作、是要等到下半年來進行的、在今天舉行這半年大會的時候、我們願意極忠實的、報告我們工作的狀况、給社會知道、並且請求社會的批判和指教、在已往半年中、本會工作的成績、因另有總幹事的報告、所以在這一方面、我不必多說什麼、我現在所要說的、就是希望諸君對於我們的工作、能切切實實的一點也不客氣的、加上一番的考核、加上一番的評判、從前有一個商家、常對他的主顧們說、倘若諸君對於我們的服務、認爲有不滿意之處、就請老實不客氣的告訴我們、呌我們改正、倘若對於我們的服務認爲滿意呢、就請諸君在朋友們面前、爲我們盡的義務的宣傳、好呌我們日後、推廣服務的範圍、今天我也可以照樣的說一句、「倘若諸君對於慈幼恊會的工作、認爲有不滿意之處、就請老實不客氣的告訴我們、呌我們改正、倘若對於我們的工作認爲滿意呢、就請諸君在朋友們面前、爲本會盡的義務的宣傳、好呌我們推廣日後工作的範圍」、在已往本會之所以能有一點小小的成就、這完全是因爲社會上一般同情人士、時常的對本會加以督責和贊助的原故、祥熙忝爲本會會長、這是我應該代表本會、向一般同情人士鄭重致謝的、從今以後、本會的責任旣然更重、而本會的工作也更多、那末我們對於社會的需求、較之已往、當然來得更加迫切、所以在這一方面致謝諸君之時、在另一方面、我更不得不代表本會、要求諸君給我們以更嚴厲的督責、與更廣大的贊助、現在世界上一個最惹人注意的國家、就要算爲蘇俄了、在從前、世界各國沒有一個看得起蘇俄的、都以爲蘇俄是一個文化落後的國家、然而自從蘇俄的五年建國計劃成功以後、世界各國、莫不刮目相看、承認蘇俄也是一個文明的國家、也是一個强大的國家、談到我們中國、若站在慈幼的立塲來說、誠然是處處比不上人家的、平常外國人談起話來、總以爲中國是一個文化落後的國家、在各方面都不加講求、尤其對於兒童的幸福與兒童的教育、向來不知道加以注意的、我希望、並且堅决的相信、倘若中華慈幼恊會的五年計劃、能逐項的實現起來、那末中國兒童的幸福與兒童的教育必能有宏大的發展、而中國的國際文化地位、也一定能夠提高起來、不致於再聽到人家說我們中國是一個文化落後的國家了、這一切的一切、全賴於我們的奮起努力、全賴於我們的刻苦奮鬥、願與大家共同勉勵、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>再談雞生蛋的問題</h3>
<p>——答胡傑等</p>
<p>前幾天我們發表了「雞生蛋蛋生雞」的問題一文，很引起了讀者的注意，但那篇文章是偏重在生物學方面的解釋，內容未免過於專門，所以有的讀者還不能充分了解，現在再用更通俗一點的說法來說明這個問題。</p>
<p>這一個問題，在表面上好像僅是雞的問題，但實際上並不僅只是限於雞，就在日常生活裏，也有類似情形和類似的疑問。例如我們早晨到店裏或工塲裏去做工作，晚上回家來吃飯睡覺，我們用我們的勞力每個月換得一點工錢拿到家裏去維持家裏的人的生活，同時家裏的人又用我所供給的錢替我預備生活上所必要的衣服食物住宅等種種東西。家裏人如果沒有我的供給固然不能生活，但我如果沒有家裏的人來替我照料生活上的必要事件，我的生活也會發生問題，因爲我整天的時間要拿去做工作，實在沒有工夫來照料自己的生活的緣故。因此，我們就要問了：「到底是我養活家裏的人呢，抑或是家裏的人養活我呢？」這和我們所問「到底是雞生蛋呢？抑或是蛋生雞呢？」不是有點類似了嗎？或者又有人要說：現在社會上沒有家住的人也不少呢，他們過着流浪生活，白天做工作，晚上的住處吃處則完全沒有一定，這裏一晚，那裏一晚，這裏一頓，那裏一頓，他們沒有家，不是仍然可以過活嗎？不錯，這種人是有的，但是對於這種人，又有另外的類似的問題發生了，這種人，他肚子餓了，要用他工作所得的錢到店舖裏面去買吃的，他要睡覺的時候，必得要用他的工作所得的錢到臨時寄宿處去買睡覺的地方，他要靠着賣飯的人和寄宿處的老闆們的力量來維持他的生命，同時，賣飯的人和寄宿處的老闆們又要依靠着吃飯人和住店人來維持自己的生活，於是我們又要問了。到底是吃飯住店的人養活老闆呢？抑或是老闆們養活吃飯住店的人？這還不是同樣性質的問題嗎？　　（未完）</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>教部督學</h3>
<p>最近視察湖南職教改進意見</p>
<p>教育部日前派督學顧肇麐、視察湖南職業教育狀况、視察結果、業經呈報教部、茲將該項報告中關於湖南職業教育亟應改進之要點、探誌於左、</p>
<h3>（甲）關於一般者</h3>
<p>（一）省立職業學校設科多有重複、如省立高工設有機械科、省立長沙一職、衡陽三職、寶慶四職、亦各設有金工科、名目雖殊、內容大致相同、染織·應化兩科、亦有同樣情形、應採取下列辦法、以求改正、A分科辦理、此項辦法、係將一科內所屬之類別、抽出其適於地方情形之部分、加重其研究及學習之分量、同時縮小其原設課程之範圍、以求藝術之專精、如湘西一帶、油料及皮革產量豐富、常德二職之應化科、即可專攻油漆或製革、寶慶一帶、可供造紙之纖維質原料甚多、寶慶四職所研究改良之漂紙、已較土產爲佳、即可專研造紙、如上項辦法在某科內、不能適用、該科設置、又一時無法變通時、即可將兩個以上的學校之相同的科目、併於一校辦理、俾改爲單科之設置、B集中辦理、如能澈底改造全省職業學校、最好集中辦理、假定長沙一職辦理金工科、即將衡陽·寶慶兩金工科歸併於長沙、常德設置油漆製革等之應用化學科、即將衡陽·寶慶兩個應化科請併於常德、寶慶專辦染織科、即將長沙·衡陽·常德三處歸併寶慶、（以地勢言則常德辦染織寶慶辦應化爲便）、如是工廠設備、易於統籌全局、而教導人才、亦易量宜支配、惟改造之際、不無困難之處、應周密籌劃、妥謀實施、</p>
<p>（二）湘省職業學校辦理情形、私立學校成績頗見優良、如修業楚怡、公榆等校均能選擇職業學科內一二科目、精練學生技能、俾畢業後可以從事生產事業、殊爲可取、嗣後省立學校亦應注意、以免空泛、</p>
<p>（三）設有機械科之各校、惟省立高工私立楚怡兩校工廠設備較佳、可以擔負製造成件機械之任務、如各項機械設計較難、可仿造通用的小規模造胰、製油印刷等之舶來的機器、用作地方新工業之倡導、其餘設有金工科之各校、工廠設備較差者、應即因應地方生產情形、注意修理、配備各式機件及製造新農具、五金雜件等之工作、以期實用、</p>
<p>（四）省立桂陽五職陶瓷科成品尙有可觀、惟校址偏僻、運輸不便、教育廳所擬遷校計劃、確係切要之圖、應設法進行、省立芷江六職原設有油漆·應化·農業三件、因設備簡單、辦理頗感困難、應按照單科設置之原則、停辦一二科、以便集中力量、專意整頓、</p>
<p>（五）長沙私立衡粹、自治民範如女子職校、或兼辦刺繡、縫紉兩科或專辦縫紉一科、成績均有可觀、應約集其他成績較佳之同類學校互相聯絡、並成立出品研究會、以求進益、可依下列各原則辦理之、A、刺繡方面、除原有山水花鳥的屏聯、及圖案的檯氈靠枕爲國人所習見外、應再研求歐美新式圖案、及外國社會上習用品物、消費習慣、作行銷海外之準備、此類物品須以美觀實用爲主、此外對於歐美重大工程、各國當代科學家、名人肖像及其他古今著名的藝術品、亦可廣爲搜羅、充實教材、製作有美術價値之精品、B、縫紉方面、大致尙切實用、各校在學學生及畢業生所組設之合作社、承做衣物之價格、亦屬低廉、惟精美的西服及制服、則視商店出品已有遜色、婦女飾品尙未顧及、最好視社會需要情形、分精製常製兩種、精製價格、可酌量增多、則不但可以應付社會高級消費者之需要、兼可提高學生工作之技能、C、出品研究會應舉辦展覽會、以資觀摩、而便銷售</p>
<p>（六）省立職業學校校長及職業科主任教員、與省外實業界聯絡之機會太少、應由教育廳輪派前往上海廣州各工廠及職業學校爲有計畫之參觀考察、以資借鏡、每一通常科目至少須有二人、可視經費狀况分年舉行、但參觀人員對於設有同科之其他省立學校、須有報告參觀所得之義務、</p>
<p>（七）湘省職業教育、缺乏研究推進之組織、如限於經費、未能恢復以前設立之職業教育委員會、可由教育廳約集教育界熱心人士、及專門技術人才、共組一諮詢設計之團體、以資策進、</p>
<p>（八）省立職業學校、如按原有狀况、以謀整理、其初步、當以完成高農之遷建計畫、高工之繼續建築計畫、及寶慶四職之增加工廠設備、桂陽五職之遷移校舍等事、爲最急切、均須儘先撥欵辦理、</p>

<p>開辦費一百萬元</p>
<p>已經庚欵會通過</p>

<h3>北平鴨</h3>
<p>— 永財</p>
<p>看過「御香縹緲錄」關於慈禧太后和鴨這一段的描寫，使我想到北平的鴨，北平鴨，凡是到過北平的，大槪沒有不嘗過這異味的燒鴨。</p>
<p>北平鴨和別處的燒鴨可以說在根本上就不同。（一）飼鴨特法：對於鴨一切的食料都經過精細的選擇，每頓總是把鴨喂得飽飽的，因爲怕鴨多運動了而减瘦，不許到水中游泳，整天都是關在園子裏。（二）燒的方法：雖和他處同，但燃料又不同，燒鴨的燃料並不是普通的柴木，而是棗樹枝幹，據說這也是北平鴨之美味的一個原因。（三）食的方法·在南方罷，燒鴨總算是一種陪菜，雖有時也拿作主菜，但可以說很難得，北平鴨就不是這樣了，北平就最少有十家專吃燒鴨的館子。上館子坐定了，店夥們便會拿了幾隻生鴨給你挑選，一會兒他便拿剛挑選的鴨燒成，整個的再給你看，然後有兩個店夥就站在門外，一個切，一個裝，一盆盆的將肉和皮送上來，吃的方法是把鴨肉和皮捲在麵粉做的薄餅中，俗稱荷菜餅，塗上了些醬，一齊吃，鴨骨和鴨頭照例是不送上來，而却加上了些天津白菜煮成一大鍋湯，假使你吃了還不夠飽，那可以呌他們用鴨油炒一大盤麵，（四）吃的價目也不貴，像一隻夠三個人吃的鴨和其他的食物合起來無論如何不出三元。這也是北平鴨普遍的主因。</p>
<p>提起北平鴨誰也會想到北平前門外的玉華臺，據說這舖子已有五六十年的歷史，專售燒鴨，至今營業仍是不衰呢。</p>
<h3>瓜話</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>俗傳西瓜種來自西土，故名西瓜。其說殊不可信，若以此推之，則東瓜：（一作冬瓜）南瓜；北瓜；均將來自東，南，北方乎？西瓜多圓形，惟德州之瓜則作長形，以其形似枕頭，故名「枕頭瓜，」其味甘美無比。年來都中瓜販，多植此種，故枕頭瓜都中獨多，但其美味，較之眞正之德州枕頭瓜大有遜色，蓋土質之關係也，今歲津浦鐵路南京營業所代辦德州枕頭瓜，每擔連運費</p>
<h3>春秋</h3>
<p>氷如</p>
<p>送力，僅取洋四元六角五分，都中人土，均得一快朶頤矣。</p>
<p>馬鈴瓜爲瓜中之佳品，形極小，如香瓜，而味絕鮮味，惜不可多得，愛瓜者頗引爲憾事也！聞首都總理陵園中種瓜極多，三白；枕頭；馬鈴；均有種植，惟所產不多，非具有要人資格，不易購得。</p>
<p>三白瓜瓜皮；瓜瓤；瓜子皆白色，故名三白，亦瓜中之佳品也，聞以蘇州所產者最佳。西瓜不但瓜瓤可食，卽瓜皮；瓜子；亦均可食。皮瓜削去外皮，切成細絲，以鹽醃之，以蔴醬油拌之，別具風味，下粥妙品也，瓜子以鹽水炒之。亦與坊市間所售者無異。</p>
<p>今歲因雨水缺乏，瓜多弱小，且其甜味，更遜往年，種瓜者受此打擊，莫不垂頭喪氣，蓋彼等每恃此一季營業，以作終歲之需也。</p>
<h3>冰淇淋</h3>
<p>— 乃令</p>
<p>自從我們曉得用冰來製作食品之後，「冰淇淋」這名字已經是「不踁而走」了；無論是什麼窮鄕僻壤，只要有「冰淇淋」擔子到那邊的，便沒有一個不曉得這個洋化的名字。我以爲，從英語譯音過來而成的「外來語」，再沒有那一個比這「冰淇淋」更通行更普遍的了！「冰淇淋」之爲物，因其吃進口里，便覺通身凉爽，所以一到夏天便隨處有這玩意兒出賣了，而吃的人也很多很多。據說最初有「冰淇淋」的時候，許多人見而生畏，原因是吃不慣的人，一把「冰淇淋」吃進口里，牙齒便要發疫了，如呑進一團火一樣；但是，不多見，大家都吃慣了，便變成了夏天少不了的恩物了。</p>
<p>記得往年在廣州的時候，一到夏天，常常與三二同事，合凑了一元幾角，打了一個電話到河南成記，（廣州最出名的冰淇淋店），不一刻，整桶的「冰淇淋」送過來了。於是大家圍着桶，不用杯，而改用碗來大嚼其「冰淇淋；」這種痛快的食法，到現在想起來還覺得滿有興味！可是，聽說去年死了的文學家彭家煌，便是因爲吃多了「冰淇淋」而致病，結果腸壞而死嚇！天下事眞是矛盾的多，好吃的東西偏不能多吃，如意的事偏不會多遇，的確是做人也沒甚味兒哩！</p>
<h3>高郵蛋</h3>
<p>— 冠英</p>
<p>「賣高郵蛋！」最近一兩個月來，在街頭巷尾，時常聽到這種淸銳的呌賣聲。內中有婦人，有小孩，有壯年小夥子，有龍鍾老太婆。他們手中都提一籃白色的鮮潔的鴨蛋，沿街嘶喚着，從他們身上的衣裳，和土頭土腦的模樣兒看來，無疑的是才由農村跑出來的。近年來，農村經濟破產使他們不能安居生活，齊大夥兒帶着這唯一的土產品－鴨蛋－來自都市中求售，糊口，這情形也夠可憐了。</p>
<p>平時在店鋪裏和攤販上，非十個子以至於十一二個子買不到一隻的高郵蛋，現在從他們手中，七八個子就可以買到。這固然是他們的純樸天眞，不曉得欺騙抬價；但在這百物落價的時候，他們怎能不貶低價格出售？實在，七八子兒一個眞吃得過。剖開來，裏面鮮黃油潤的顏色，使人可愛，品味的優美，的確非別處出產的所可比擬。在這夏天晚間，浴罷納凉，以之佐食綠豆粥，眞是別饒風味呢。</p>
<p>高郵是蘇北的一縣，城沿運河，河西便是一片汪洋的高寶湖，地土肥沃，湖濱一帶的居民，多以養鴨爲業，千百成羣。因爲魚蝦等供給採取的充分和便利，所以產下來的蛋，肥美異常。最著名的尙有一種雙黃蛋，比尋常蛋要大，內面蛋黃有普通兩個大小，是兩隻蛋併在一道產下來的。作者昔年負笈淮陰時，道經高郵，船泊碼頭，卽有許多鄕婦上船兜售，曾一嘗雙黃蛋，色鮮味美，殊勝尋常，至今猶令人回憶呢。</p>
<h3>摩登飲料</h3>
<p>— 嘴張</p>
<p>這個年頭，是摩登化的年頭，一切一切，都非摩登不興，在上海，便連馬路旁邊的街頭飲冰處，也摩登起來了。他們同樣有鮮橘子的刨冰出售，而且盃子裏頭也斜挿着一枝麥管。中下社會的同胞，化了微細的代價，便可用摩登的方法，暢飲摩登的飲料，以消溽暑，當然是件極便宜的事；所以這一類摩登化的街頭飲冰處，往往是座上客常滿的。</p>
<p>但我們試一研究街頭飲冰處鮮橘子刨冰的原料，則不禁嚇了一跳。鮮橘子刨冰的主要原料，當然是鮮橘子水了。在一隻玻璃或洋磁的容器裏，裝着滿滿的火黃色水，這水的上面又浮着幾個切開的花旗橘子。水有沒有開過？火黃的顏色是不是用有毒染料染成的？那不得而知；但你若去細細觀察那幾個切開了的花旗橘子，便立刻可以發現無論在表皮或者內裏，往往有一塊塊灰墨的瘢點存在。原來這是飲冰處主人貪了賤價，向水菓舖子收買潰爛的貨色，削去腐敗不堪的部分，投在水面上，做幌子的。</p>
<p>至於吸冰水的那根麥管，那更說不得了。本來吸汽水或冰水的要用麥管，無非爲避免傳染病起見，所以麥管用過之後，便應將它立刻丟掉：但街頭飲冰處的主人小氣得眞是出奇，甲主顧用過的麥管，往往停會又被挿在乙主顧的杯子中間了。麥管是紙製的，經過幾度的浸潤，當然疲軟得不成樣了：若說甲主顧有傳染病的，那病菌自然無疑地也傳染到乙主顧身上去了。</p>
<p>在這出奇的大熱天，本來誰也得想享用一點淸凉飲料的。但就經濟力不十分充足者想法，則：自己燒好一壺開水，擱一點白糖在裏邊，買幾個子兒碎冰把它鎭得涼透了，也何嘗不涼沁心脾。又何苦一定要搭架子去飲這種名是實非的摩登飲料，將腐爛果實的汁水，和不知誰何的傳染病菌，一起吃下肚去呢？</p>
<h3>杭州知味觀的餛飩</h3>
<p>— （灰馬）</p>
<p>凡是上杭州去白相白相的人，都得在湖上找幾家小喫的館子，可是一進去，無非喫兩樣著名的杭菜，像醋溜魴魚；淸會蕁羹；生炒蝦仁……等等而已。</p>
<p>是的，西湖裏的水，是那樣淸澈而活潑，是那樣地令人可愛；因此，就不禁使人勾起了想喫水裏特殊產物的念頭。</p>
<p>可是「知味觀」在杭州也是家有名的館子，生意很是不錯，他的餛飩很著名，如果跑進去喫碗鮮美的蝦仁餛飩，喝一碗花雕的話，那是比喫上幾塊大洋的小喫還有味些。</p>
<p>白相了一次西湖，可惜有許多人竟連這「知味觀」的餛飩都沒有領教過的。</p>
<p>（編者按蘇州宮巷支弄太監弄中鴻興館的大餛飩，其味尤在知味觀之上，知味者類能言之。）</p>
<h3>無錫的脆鱔與江陰的輭鱔</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>筆者世居江陰，且請先說江陰的事。</p>
<p>江陰地濱長江，在前淸是無錫·常熟·靖江·泰興等江南北八邑童生會集來考秀才之所；在那時候，江陰新景園的麵，是極爲鄰縣七邑童生所稱譽的。而時値夏令，下麵最佳妙的菜，却又首推鱔絲！譬如現在我們約朋輩三數走進江陰的餐館，（無論你吃麵或喝酒）那擺滿桌子的菜碟，除了一兩碟「子蝦」之外，其餘便全是鱔絲了。而且假如你吃了不夠，堂倌也還會不斷的添上來的。這可見江陰地方對於吃鱔絲那東西的擅長。</p>
<p>但鱔絲却又有脆鱔與輭鱔的不同。脆鱔彷彿是無錫的特產，江陰雖也間或有，却便沒有無錫的做得好，適如其度。反之，輭鱔却便是江陰的特製　品，無錫的餐館裏是根本沒有的。</p>
<p>有一次，路過無錫，無錫的朋友請吃麵，吃到一碟脆鱔，那朋友便得意地介紹說：「這是脆鱔，是無錫的特製，別地方是沒有的。」我吃了幾筷，雖也覺脆得可口，却總嫌不如江陰輭鱔之有味。於是便接着說：「是的，脆鱔別地方雖沒有，但我們江陰的輭鱔是更其有味的，有便不妨請到敝縣去嘗試一下，評較評較看！」當時，那朋友竟沒有響，而兩隻眼睛却充份顯露着一種不相信的神氣。在他以爲，無錫的脆鱔是應該可以獨步的。</p>
<p>又一次路過無錫，那位朋友却便笑嘻嘻地和我說：「誠然誠然，江陰的輭鱔比無錫的脆鱔要好吃得多，實在是其味深長！」那位朋友是讀過古書的，所以談吐很文雅。談到後來，我知道他已經　跟幾個朋友一起到過江陰，并且嘗過那美味的輭鱔了。聞名不如嘗味，」以前的鄙薄一變而爲今日之譽揚，那也難怪。</p>
<p>題外的話扯得太長了，如今且說一說脆鱔與輭鱔的製法。</p>
<p>（一）初步的料理　所謂初步的料理，無論做脆鱔或輭鱔都是相同的。那便是說，把一條條生龍活虎的鱔魚拿來殺死，抽去肚腸，洗去汚血，然後放到沸水裏面，約摸過兩三分鐘時候便撈起來。（也有人把完整的活鱔魚放到沸水裏再撈起來改洗去骨的，不過那太髒一點。）撈　起來之後，可用銳利的小尖刀在鱔魚的背脊骨上左右劃開，那脊骨自然會去掉，而所剩的都是純肉了。至此，初步的料理遂告終止。</p>
<p>（二）脆鱔的製法　先配合五分之一的酒，五分之一·五的糖，五分之二的醬油，五分之0·五的鹽，再加老薑三五片，以吊鮮味。然後把洗凈的鱔絲放進去浸透，約二十分鐘（如時間允許那是愈久愈好的。）之後取出，可即投入煮沸的油鍋裏，（豬油最佳，豆油亦可。）至略枯而還不至變質的時候撈起來，便是脆鱔。食時香脆，蘸酷吃或蘸醬蔴油吃隨客的便。</p>
<p>（三）輭鱔的製法　做輭鱔是先把鱔絲放到油鍋子裏去煎煮的，在方法的先後程序上恰和做脆鱔相反。做輭鱔在油鍋裏煮的程度切不能至於枯的地步，等滿身皺起，核心亦煮透的時候硬可以取起來了。取起來之後，即可浸在和做脆鱔相仿的作料裏，最好能用銅鍋放在文火上再燉半個鐘頭，否則便那麼浸三五個鐘頭也行。吃的時候有汁，可不必再蘸什麼，江陰人是歡喜夾些薑絲吃的。</p>
<p>脆鱔輭鱔的製法已略如上述，大槪煮得好煮不好的焦點，全在料作的配合和油煎的久暫上！讀者如能照此法煎煮，當也不會上當。至於做得好不好，那是無錫和江陰兩地的庖丁們的特長了，我們當也不會輕易學得到的。</p>
<p>筆者個人，始終還是輭鱔的讚揚者，那味道要比脆鱔深長得多了。</p>

<p>（金鷄堅穩）標紗前市開盤、以美棉轉漲、但塲中以本月份關係、市盤仍弱、拍至遠月稍昂、二三盤以棉花趨漲、紗市帶漲、浮空抵補、結果各月均漲二·三·四·六角、午後聞現紗交易滯鈍、市氣又鬆、各月跌一·二·三·四角、全日成交統計二萬三千七百五十包、查賣出仁豐一千一百包、元一一千一百五十包、大昶一千零五十包、瑞大一千三百包、恒昌四百包、大福四百五十包、買進賡豐四百包、通記一千零五十包、錦昌五百包、愼昌九百五十包、遠大三百包、長豐五百五十包、德記三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>火機帮抵補標花</h3>
<p>棉市趨堅、秋來氣候仍乾、棉樹遭損不淺人心轉昂、火機帮大量的抵補、某公司亦獲利買回、市盤乃徐徐而漲、但現棉交易較淸、天時如續亢旱無雨、十月期價有六元外之希望、</p>
<p>（遠期鄭標好三角半）標棉前市開盤、印度棉跌二·四·羅比、美棉微漲六至十磅音、買風益熾、以邇來秋旱無雨、於棉花大爲不利、棉苗有蕉枯之虞、因之大戶獲利、空頭抵進、火機帮亦大批買進抵補、市盤步步而緊、各月漲一·二·三角、惟本月份以收貨者少、獨跌二角、午後形勢仍挺、各月又漲五分至一角、全日成交統計十二萬八午六百担、查賣出大昶二千六百担、恊成一千五百担、恒德二千二百担、昶記二千四百担、惠康一千一百担、錦昌二千九百担、源大五千担、賡豐一千七百担、遠大一千三百担、愼記二千二百担、益昶一千七百担、信誠二千四百担、源興昌一千七百担、長和二千七百担、恊生一千五百担、益豐一千九百担、買進大孚一萬一千担、吉豐一千八百担、大豐一千三百担、恊成一千九百担、大昶一千六百担、新亨七千五百担、裕康一千四百担、裕大一千八百担、元一二千九百担、長豐五千六百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>上海日廠</h3>
<p>細紗虧折粗紗獲利</p>
<p>上海日商紗廠、因棉花進口稅增後、採算漸感困難、就最近棉價而論、計算日紗成本、用美棉爲二十一之四十二支、其生產費與市價相伯仲、殆無虧損、三十二支及四十支每包須虧十元至十五元、十六支及二十支則能獲利二元至五元、</p>
<h3>糧食　期粉開後步見上升</h3>
<p>麥價所好無幾</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份初平繼漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小二三角左右、坎拿大好一二角不等、開價時本月份雖較小去一分、九月份開價未動、自十月份起、因內地帮方面、步步吸收、良以天時久旱、秋收失望、米價以需求之殷、有不可抑平之勢、是以有關係者、投機之心理、又見活躍、故市面亦順此潮流、復入堅昂、至四盤時較之前日、反回高二分左右矣、迨至下午開盤、以內地帮之續進於前、營口等帮、亦略有吸進、兼之市塲人心、亦見佳好、故開價步呈俏利、如十二月一月份、又已重出七角大關、照天災之可畏、民食前途、或須步入惶恐、不識政府當局、曾作未雨之綢繆否、結果本月份較前日續好三分七厘半、九月份漲五分二厘半、十月份漲四分七厘半、十一月份漲五分二厘半、十二月份好五分二厘半、一月份好四分、</p>
<h3>現麥成交二萬包</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致平穩、以洋麥報價、互有出入、至市塲人心、因本月份爲現貨關係、未能跳動、市面始終呈平定之象、至遠期各月份、市氣雖覺緊張、惟以買戶甚寂、業內外多頭均觀望、致交易甚少、市面亦漲勢甚微也、不過粉市旣見步俏、後步麥市、恐須同入高昂之境、當亦爲事實上所不可免也、結果八九月份各較好一分、十月份好三分、十一月份好二分、十二月份好三分、一月份好一分、現麥市面、因廠方壓住、仍然平定、開山東蚌埠徐州歸德麥四元、六合高郵麥三元九角、瑤灣麥三元九角八分、安慶麥三元九角三分、由福新去一萬五千包、早豐去五千包云、</p>
<h3>沙市糙秈激漲一元</h3>

<h3>論道德文章</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>今夏，在暑期將近的當兒，承各友關懷，紛紛寫信來問及我暑後的行踪。地們信中總是說像我的道德文章，新任必定要借重的，可是結果則未能盡如他們的所料。於是他們只好退一步想，再紛紛寫信來安慰我，說些像我的道德文章，何愁沒人禮聘等語。他們的盛意，固是可感；但不禁使我對於所謂道德文章，大起懷疑了。</p>
<p>估定一個人的道德，本來同估定學生操行成績一樣的不易準確。就是文章，要做到一個『通人』，也是不易。何况道德文章，向來又是分拆不開的。記得少時讀過曾鞏的『寄歐陽舍人書』。他因歐陽修替他的祖父致堯做了一篇墓誌銘，所以把歐陽修的道德文章，推爲『數百年而始有』；可是歐陽修的道德文章，究竟怎樣了不得，卽曾鞏也說不出其所以然。這可見道德文章的不易估定了。曾鞏又把『人之行』分做五等：卽（一）情善迹非，（二）意奸外淑，（三）善惡相懸不可實指，（四）實大於名，（五）名侈於實。這五項標準，似乎比近今學校裏把甲乙丙丁戊五等來估定學生的操行成績切實些，然試把它們來估定我的道德，卽我自己也不知居於何等；就是分請友人來各別估定，恐怕也各定各的，和教師評定學生操行成績一般的難得準確，何况這五項標準還不是眞道德！</p>
<p>我因此想：一做了中國文人，最好能掮起一扇『扶世翼教』的大牌子，雖然吃過孔廟裏冷猪肉的也屈指可數。惟其如此，所以自古以來文人的集子裏，總要挿入些代聖賢立話的大文章，或者說些捧捧主子的堂皇語。這樣，恐使配得上稱『畜道德能文章』了。我生也晚，將如之何！</p>
<p>二十三年八月於將往紹興時</p>
<h3>異議的異議</h3>
<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>在今日的中國，文學這撈什子，要算頂倒霉了。一方有人憤憤地說：『文學不死，大禍不止』！一方又有人說，文學無用。</p>
<p>也許，這兩種說法，可以歸併爲一種的，因爲文學無用，不如科工，這才大禍不止的。</p>
<p>於是有人起來打抱不平了。如王平陵先生，對於推重科工，咀咒文學，表示異議，說中國提倡科工，已『有六十年之久』，『耗費了國家無慮幾千萬兆金鎊的留學費』，却『並沒有人明目張膽地提倡過文藝運動，國家從來就沒有對文學犧牲過一個留學費，政府從來就沒有對文藝的設施，有過絲毫的計畫，』而且認爲：『這樣下去，中國的文學，一定會死的；不過，文學死了以後，大禍能不能止，這責任就都要研究科工的人完全負擔了。』</p>
<p>他替文學伸寃，我們可以贊成。不過，這裏也有幾點異議，要待提出。</p>
<p>說國家從來就沒有對文學犧牲過一個留學費，這是對的。但有一義未盡，這並不是指一切費，並不是國家對文學除留學費外就沒有犧牲過一個什麼費；費，並不是限於留學費的。說沒有人明目張膽地提倡過文藝運動，這是一半對的。五四時代的新文學運動，就是明目張膽地提倡的。過此以後，確也好說沒有明目張膽地提倡過，也『不知是什麼緣故』。至於說政府從來就沒有對文藝的設施有過絲毫的計畫，這是完全錯的。也許，王先生以爲計畫是『絲毫的』，因而沒有看見。總之，這樣的摧殘文學的責任，至少也是漠視文學的責任，國家政府是不能負擔的；而且，也須代爲伸寃的。</p>
<p>關於國家對於文學，他又列舉希特萊的對於霍甫德曼，華格羅，墨索里尼的對於鄧南遮與知識份子，法國的對於囂俄，法朗士，那樣推崇，優禮有加，以及蘇俄秉政的大抵是出身於文藝界，日本文部省的輔助文藝的進展，來反映中國的情况，言下若不勝其慨然，羨慕。其實，這倒是不必的；且也無須旁證博引，就在中國，却也是『古已有之』的，這只要看從來的『文治』兩個字，便可明白一般。但是，依照中國的『國情』，這樣的積極『尙文』，也只不過產生了許多廊廟文學；反而不在這個影響之下，還能產生一些如水滸，紅樓夢，儒林外史的作品。所以，我們並不奢望國家怎樣崇尙文學，過於爬得高了，難保不跌得愈重的，不如平淡一些的好。</p>
<p>因此，最後，回到前文，說一說文學的無用與大禍。但又只有幾句，旣認文學爲無用了，那麼，卽使有禍，則無用之禍，也並不大的。</p>
<h3>病與文章</h3>
<p>— 席滌塵</p>
<p>在時下的小品隨筆中，每看到一些讚美「小病」的文字，說是小病是一種人生的淸福。除了在忙迫的生活之中可以獲到暫時的一點火休息以外，還可以使得一顆日常緊縮的心，稍得舒展一下，而落於一種淸淡寗靜的狀態裏去。</p>
<p>實在，這種平寗的心境是最適宜於寫淸麗一流的小品文字。一來，小病時候的心緒，固然比較閑淡，觀察四周事物，會得特別細膩一些，也好像要感到新鮮一些；二來，若不經意的，將觀察所得寫下來的時候，也一定用筆輕靈，似乎祗是拿着筆一路隨意地滑過去，毫不着力的樣子。好的文章，往往在這種時候可以得到，因爲人在窮和病的時候，是最容易表現出「眞」來。</p>
<p>也正因爲這緣故，閑病時候的文章往往令人覺得玲瓏可愛，風味淸新。郁達夫先生的文章就如此。最近看到徐蔚南先生的「寄雲的信」也不禁有此感想。</p>
<p>這集子，是作者去歲偶因病肺，小住乍浦一月時候的記錄。（雖然用了信的形式）作者浮身物外，抱了悠閑的心情，孩子似的興味去觀察乍浦的山海風月，物態人情，於是一椿一樣，以淸秀的筆緻，輕輕淡淡的寫來，眞猶如畫一般，覺得樸素淸新。</p>
<p>對於海，作者描寫得最多。乍浦陰天的海，晴天的海的各種姿態，可說全收在筆底。我最愛底下的一節：</p>
<p>「看海是一件愉快的事，尤其是看上潮時的海。當那潮水升到沙灘上來時，如果從山上望下去，你可看見那潮水像是一片疊一片的。一片水擁到沙灘上了，接着就是第二片水蓋在第一片上。這樣一片蓋過一片，永不休止。從山上走下來，到沙灘上看那潮水就像捲過來的，彷彿是一幅展開着的畫，一點兒一點兒捲起來，到沙灘高處，畫便捲完了。這還是初上潮的情景，等到高潮（尤其在陰歷的十四五日）那不是一片一片地擁過來，却是一大塊一大塊躍過來跌過來了。到了沙灘上，像是忿怒極了，跳起來，飛起來，轟轟地怒號，因爲被頑固的沙灘阻止着，便吐了一堆白沫而退下去，但又立刻再用力擠到沙灘上，像非將這片沙灘征服不可，後來那沙灘果然被潮水漸漸征服了。遠望海水衝激島邊，像是一陣白烟。天空照射着强烈的陽光時，那潮水面上彷彿舖滿了一顆顆的水晶，跟着潮頭滾過來，將近沙灘時，便都不見了。但前面又有一大堆在滾過來了。海島脚下有時還有一點兩點特別明亮的，像是常明燈，永遠在海面照明。」</p>
<p>一個人的小病，眞是一個人的最好的休息。在這休息裏，可以培養培養一個人的「力」。看了上面的一例，當可想像得到，作者是從海得了怎樣大的啟示。</p>
<p>作者文字，原以淸麗見稱，但現在是更加輕快了。</p>
<h3>３×２＝６人</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>馬來農村小景（上）</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>騎着脚踏車沿着熱帶森林的巷道前進，一路上便可以看見一個一個的疏散的村落在樹叢間散佈着。</p>
<p>一間搭在平地上架在木椿之上的「阿答」厝，屋前曠埕上種上熱帶的紅葉樹，芬芳的香花和熱帶的樹木。薝前的欄杆漆上碧綠的顏色，屋里在一盞煤油燈之下，映着一些畫片和瓷盤。在屋外，椰林或檳榔樹在大地上展延着、在最遠的外層，用着竹籬或紅花圍做籬笆，每天有一二個工人拿着剪刀懶懶地含着一支爪哇烟草在做修剪的工作的，那是馬來人的貴族之家。</p>
<p>受着熱帶植物的間隔，在其他的部分有馬來平民的「阿答」厝。樸素的木板和受盡風雨侵凌的暗黑的樹葉屋頂，在樹影之下顯着灰黯的顏色。屋外羊聲哶哶地在呌，一羣小鷄在野草上喙食。屋主人拿着「巴闌」刀，編着「阿答」樹葉。口渴時便爬上高高的椰樹梢上，摘下一個果子，爬下來用刀削去纖維質的皮殻，鑿成一個小孔，用口吸着里面果漿的液汁。那是馬來平民的「冰淇淋」或汽水</p>
<p>在平常的日子。馬來農村是在一種和平與靜穆的空氣里存在着。炎陽從樹葉的孔隙間篩下他的光影在地上，風微微地在樹叢間搖蕩。屋前每每有條小溪，在拴着一隻馬來小舟的旁邊，馬來孩童便裸着櫌黑的赤身在雨水積成的暗紅色的溪水上游泳，玩樂，和渡着炎陽的日子。</p>
<p>在炎熱的中午和午後，一個熟識的中國人會停着一輛脚踏車在屋外，口向着屋子主人：「哈囉，舒曼，（或者其他的馬來名字）請給一個椰子，解解口渴。」</p>
<p>而那位主人便會一躍放下他的工作，或從惰慵的午睡間一覺醒來，摸着「巴闌」刀，說：　「頭家，那里來？我替你拿去。」</p>
<p>待客人吸完了果汁，車便又在長着靑草的金亮的太陽光在大道上滾去了。於是屋主人便會哼着情歌，抱着一面羊皮鼓邊打邊唱着。</p>
<p>或在熱帶的驟雨里，狂風搖撼着四圍的樹叢，雨點大顆地打在「阿答」屋頂上。屋里便點上一盞椰油燈，讓昏黑的大地留下一絲光影，照在屋里簡單的傢具上，顯得一塌糊塗：幾件「紗籠」，一包米，一包糖，一罐用舊酒瓶盛着的油液，和幾支烟草，……（沒有睡床也沒有椅子。）如果風給吹散了樹葉，主人便會爬上屋頂，手拿刀，口銜着樹葉，給雨水打得一身淋漓，把屋子補好。－那時熱帶的驟雨却會過去了。</p>
<h3>門外文談</h3>
<p>— 華圉</p>
<p>（二）字是什麼人造的？</p>
<p>字是什麼人造的？</p>
<p>我們聽慣了一件東西，總是古時候一位聖賢所造的故事，對於文字，也當然要有這質問。但立刻就有忘記了來源的答話：字是倉頡造的。</p>
<p>這是一般的學者的主張，他自然有他的出典。我還見過一幅這位倉頡的畫像，是生着四隻眼睛的老頭陀。可見要造文字，相貌先得出奇，我們這種只有兩只眼睛的人，是不但本領不够，連相貌也不配的。</p>
<p>然而做「易經」的人（我不知道是誰），却比較的聰明，他說：「上古結繩而治，後世聖人易之以書契。」他不說「倉頡」，只說「後世聖人」，不說創造，只說掉換，眞是謹愼得很；也許他無意中就不相信古代會有一個獨自造出許多文字來的人的了，所以就只是這麼含含胡胡的來一句。</p>
<p>但是，用書契來代結繩的人，又是什麼脚色呢？文學家？不錯，從現在的所謂文學家的最要賣弄文字，奪掉筆幹便一無所能的事實看起來，的確首先就要想到他；他也的確應該給自己的喫飯傢伙出點力。然而並不是的。有史以前的人們，雖然勞動也唱歌，求愛也唱歌，他却並不起草，或者留稿子，因爲他做夢也想不到賣詩稿，編全集，而且那時的社會裏，也沒有報館和書舖子，文字毫無用處。據有些學者告訴我們的話來看，這在文字上用了一番工夫的，想來該是史官了。</p>
<p>原始社會裏，大約先前只有巫，待到漸次進化，事情繁複了，有些事情，如祭祀，狩獵，戰爭……之類，漸有記住的必要，巫就只好在他那本職的「降神」之外，一面也想法子來記事，這就是「史」的開頭。况且「升中于天」，他在本職上，也得將記載酋長和他的治下的大事的冊子，燒給上帝看，因此一樣的要做文章－－雖然這大約是後起的事。再後來，職掌分得更淸楚了，於是就有專門記事的史官。文字就是史官必要的工具，古人說：「倉頡，黃帝史。」第一句未可信，但指出了史和文字的關係，却是很有意思的。至於後來的「文學家」用牠來寫「啊呀呀，我的愛喲，我要死了！」那些佳句，那不過是享享現成的罷了，「何足道哉」！</p>

<h3>短波發射機述要（二）</h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>（二）自動式發射機</p>
<p>（一）實用振盪電路：自動式發射機中之振盪方式，約可分爲下列兩在類：</p>
<p>（一）磁感交連電路，（二）電容交連電路</p>
<p>設計發射機時，電路之選擇，並不十分重要，蓋振盪電路之特性，每爲電路之定數，所使用眞空管，以及調節等所左右，故欲使發射機作某一定週率之振盪時，必須備有由綫圈及電容器所組成之配諧電路。</p>
<p>普通使用最廣者爲哈脫來電路（Hartlry　circuit)，屏柵諧振電路（Tunedplate　and　tuned　grid　circuit)及考畢子電路（Colpitts　Circuit）等。</p>
<p>所謂哈脫來電路者，如上右圖所示，具有一共通綫圈，燈絲之一端常連接於該綫圈之中央，而屏柵兩極卽連接於其兩端。如是則FG間自成一柵電路，而FP間自成一屏電路。普通屏電路方面之綫圈回轉數比較柵電路方面之綫圈回轉數爲多。其振盪作用每爲兩電路之磁感交連度所左右，故其綫圈回轉數之比，大有注意之必要。</p>
<p>所謂考畢子電路者，如上左圖所示，係將哈脫來電路中之自感量取去，而另換用以電容量者，在此種方法，其振盪作用，卽爲兩電路之電容交連度所左右，故應留意於其電容量之比。</p>
<p>其次屏柵諧振電路又名阿姆斯徒郎電路（Armstrong　circuit),係由阿姆斯徒郎氏（Mr.E.H.Armstrong)所發明者，故名，上面下圖所示者是。在短波方面，此方式並無須外部的交連，屏電路中之電能皆藉眞空管之內部電容量爲媒介，而回授於柵電路，以維持振盪狀態。</p>
<h3>發射效率和週率穩定問題</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>目下我國業餘家也慢慢地傾向於短波方面了。研究短波最有趣的，可以說是做小電力的發射機。發射機所最要注意的，是如何方能使週率穩定的問題。而且因爲電力小了，所以對於效率放面也是更要顧到的。現把這兩樣的要點，詳述於下：</p>
<p>發射機週率的穩定和效率是互相有關的，雖然最適合於穩定週率的條件並不一定在某一綫路中適合於發揮牠最高的效率的。不過通常總認爲穩定一隻發射機的週率在發射機的設計上講來是比較最重要的一個問題罷了。最理想的發射機，牠所發射的信號應該永遠在一個週率上，牠在高週率波帶上應只佔據了一個最小的地位。尤其是因爲牠的電能完全集中在一個的週率上，所以牠可以發揮最大的電力。我們當收音時若能稍稍注意一下，便可發現有許多電臺，牠在度盤上所佔據的度數很多，或有時雖所佔度數不多，但往往從某個度數跳到某個度數：同時牠的信號也常常糊糊粗糙。這些電臺牠的週率都不是近於理想的，都沒有最穩定的週率的。</p>
<p>這些週率不能穩定的原因，大槪可以分成兩類。第一類是機械方面的不良，第二類是動力方面的不良。</p>
<p>發射機結構方面機械的變動和發熱的結果，往往可以引起機械不良性的週率不穩定。譬如說儲電器片子間空間的變動，綫圈圈間距離的變動和眞空管電極間距離的變動都可以引起發射週率的搖擺不定。上述的弊實，祗要我們製裝時固定各部的結構大約都很容易避免的。眞空管各極間因溫度變更而影響到距離的變動遂使電容量有相當的變動，亦是引起週率搖擺的一個原因。由這個原故所致的週率不穩定，祇要我們把眞空管所規定的電力用得小一點，便亦可避免了。</p>
<p>動力性的不穩定是和眞空管的總阻Impedance很有關係的。發射的時候屏路的總阻一變更就很會影響到週率上去。發射機的屏極電壓不穩定就可以發生週率的變動。所以濾波不良的電源最好不要應用。同時發射機也宜避免過度的激勵或不足的激勵，所以柵極激勵電壓或柵漏應當保持最適宜的數値。避免動力性不穩定最好的方法，就是注意設計綫路上的各項數値，並保持其不變更。</p>
<p>發射機負荷回路（包括屏極回路及天綫回路）的性質同了柵極回路的損失對於發射效率頗具重大的關係。所謂屏效率就是指高週率電力輸出和屏極輸入之比。計算發射機實際上完全的效率（True　over'all　efficency)時，那末絲極方面所消耗了的電力也須計算進去。有時在柵回路方面損失很大，牠的原因是因爲柵漏的損失太大或因爲有高週率電流通過柵極和燈絲。後者的發生，可以認爲在週率很高時柵極與燈絲間的電容量太大的緣故。</p>
<p>對於週率極高的振盪管我們若要計算牠的屏極效率是頗爲不容易的事。不過當振盪管在正規的屏電力消耗之下（普通當屏極有些發紅的時候）電力的輸出大約與屏電力輸入瓦特數（卽直流屏電壓乘屏電流之安培數）和規定的屏極消耗瓦特數之差相近。要求一個更準確的數値，那末當然尙須减去柵漏所消耗的電力。柵漏所耗的電力就是柵漏電阻乘以柵電流的平方。</p>
<p>總之，發射效率和週率穩定問題是短波發射方面最重要的一個問題，也是一個最不易解决的問題罷了。純粹用計算的方法去考查，往往會距實際更遠；顯然的，還要費你一翻推索的腦力呢！</p>

<h3>用紅鋅礦做擴大級的礦石機</h3>
<p>— 頴夫</p>
<p>普通的擴大工作，都是要用眞空管來做的，這是人人都知道的事情，不過若是限於經濟，那麼拿紅鋅礦（Zincite）來代替也未嘗不可以。</p>
<p>紅鋅礦是一種天然的養化鋅，牠的化學符號是ZnO,也和方鉛礦一樣，具有檢波的能力，不過用牠來做檢波時，得要用電，所以被採用的不大普遍。牠若是和一種金屬，好像鋼，或是炭，固定底相接觸着，就能產生各種週率的交流電流，所以在某幾種配合下，牠的工作情形，很和三極管相像。俄國工程師羅士夫，曾經發明用牠來做擴大器。</p>
<p>下面的一具礦石機，就是根據了羅士夫的原理而製的。成績很不錯，在本埠，可用小揚聲器來收聽各大電台，用聽筒聽來很有點震耳。但是强力的揚聲器不能用的，因爲那特性不是直綫的，所以會失眞的很利害。</p>
<p>綫路也很簡單，不過是一具選擇性很佳的礦石機，多加一級紅鋅礦的低放罷。</p>
<p>（ZnO）就是紅鋅礦，先把一管鋼釘挿進去，然後安放在礦石盤裏，再用一塊毛絨裹好，紅鋅礦的一端接正極，鋼釘的一端接負極。</p>
<p>L用廿六號紗包綫在小蛛網板上繞二十圈，L２用同號綫在大蛛網板上繞五十圈，繞妥後，可裝在推拉架上。</p>
<p>C是000三兆分法拉特的變量電容器。</p>
<p>C1,C2是000一兆分法的變量電容器。</p>
<p>C3，C4是00二兆分法固定電容器。</p>
<p>D是普通礦石，不過品質要良好些。</p>
<p>R是三百歐姆的固定電阻。</p>
<p>R１是一千五百歐姆的變量電阻。</p>
<p>乾電池可用一具四十或四十五弗打的B電。</p>
<p>我得附帶提及一下，就是天地綫的問題，在這裏要裝得好一點。天綫的高度要有十公尺，最好用兩根四十公尺長的，作平行式，式綫的距離，約一公尺，旨進綫是T字式。地綫是越短越好，倘若是繞在自來水管上，也得要繞緊一些才好。</p>
<h3>遮隔</h3>
<p>— 胡文安</p>
<p>在無綫電上。遮隔是用以阻止電能在兩個迴路裏互相傳授者。通常我們都用鉛作爲遮隔最好的材料。因爲它有低的電阻，而且分量極輕。</p>
<p>但是遮隔爲什麼是很需要的呢。蓋任何含有交流電能的廻路中。都放射一個磁塲，及一個靜電塲。這交流週率愈高。則放射的能力愈大。所以在無綫電的高週波率時候。此現象更其顯著。以收音機內而言。凡荷有此種週率之電流之導體。隨時放射其能力。使四週各導體收受，而在機內產生不應有之騷擾，回輸，等不良結果。</p>
<p>爲免除上述情形起見。在高週電路四週常置大片之導體，作爲遮隔。使其吸收前者所放出之電能。發生渦流（Eddy　current)。而消耗在此遮隔中。其電能之消耗。可依歐姆定例T２×R計算。但是同時因爲此遮隔中發生電流。而反感於原來電路中。使其放射力减小。而電能損失亦隨同降低矣。且也遮隔之反感能力與其電流I成正比。故製造家多用較厚之遮隔。以得較小之R値。而增加I値。則遮隔之效能更臻完善。</p>
<p>除高週放大。中週放大管。震盪管。及其調節綫圈。儲電器等。均須個別遮隔外。其間各接綫。亦宜用軟銅絲管遮隔之。</p>
<p>遮隔旣能隔離磁塲。同時又能分隔靜電位。其法唯何。蓋將遮隔直接地卽可。以假定地爲永久中和者。</p>
<p>遮隔旣爲吸收電能者。故宜在可能範圍中。與被遮隔物愈遠愈佳。同時須注意者。此遮隔絕對不能藉以通某種電路。以失其遮隔之本旨。所以收音機中之高週迴路接綫之通地者。須匯集一處。不能隨時接機壳。使此負有遮隔使命之機壳，同時作高週率電流之導體也。</p>
<h3>舊眞空管作避電器</h3>
<p>— 顧維猷</p>
<p>現在天氣熱了，收音機最怕的雷電，倘然未裝避雷器的收音機，有給雷電焚燬之虞。然而買一只避雷器，亦非二三元莫辨。有一種炭精式的，經過一次雷電，下次卽不能再用，必須再買一只，甚不經濟。研究無綫電的同志們，實騐室中，一定有焚燬絲極的眞空管，現在利用牠來作一只眞空式避雷器。當天綫受到了高壓雷電，經過了引入綫，到舊眞空管的屏極而飛向柵極至地，成爲短路，（Short　cicuit）不再經過收音機其他部份，所以收音機可無虞了，並且經過了一次雷電，下次仍舊可用。其接法在天綫接柱上，接一根綫到舊眞空管的屏極，再用一根綫一端接地綫接柱，另一端接舊眞空管的柵極，這樣一只避雷器就成功了。附圖如上：</p>
<h3>簡易的避雷器</h3>
<p>— 徐系宇</p>
<p>雖然，今夏炎熱非凡，烈日當空，沒有一些凉氣，至於烏雲不知躱到那裏去了，但是，經騐告訴我們：雨將來臨了，雷電聲要不絕的發現在天空裏了，因爲這時候正是所謂「秋雨連綿」的季節啦！</p>
<p>裝有無綫電－－有天綫的－－的，豈不是就要在那時候遭着禍害嗎？－－小則損壞收音機，大則釀成火災。</p>
<p>據理論說：收音機的天綫，旣能感受電波，不消說，它定能感引天電的。</p>
<p>所以，目下假使已有了避雷器的設備，那最好沒有！不然的話，請立刻設法裝置吧！</p>
<p>最簡單的辦法，莫過於向無綫電材料行去購買一只，可是，至少須化上一二元至五六元哩！</p>
<p>這裏有個極經濟，簡單，優良的避雷器，是筆者經騐所得，其成績不亞於市上現成的。</p>
<p>找無用的－－電已用去的－－小乾電池兩段，想於剝去牠包在外面的鋅皮，然後便能瞧見裏面的炭精條，不可使牠拆斷地取出。再備三寸長寸半闊的膠板一塊，和接綫釘兩個。</p>
<p>把每條炭精條的一端，連以紫銅絲，如圖裝置。</p>
<h3>收音机</h3>
<p>揆圖中祇有一根天綫轉接收音機的，因爲若把地綫也照天綫接法，那末，在雷電時，避雷器會完全無效的，假使讀者收音機必需地綫直接連收音機，那祇好再另裝一根，爲的這根地綫是專供避雷器之用，對於收音機完全不發生關係的。</p>
<p>至於精炭條的距離，須在一分至二分之間，切不要啣接着！</p>

<h3>科學禍</h3>
<p>— 昭昭</p>
<p>前兩天，上海又發生某工廠的慘變了。在先，工廠的汽鍋爆炸，巳有多家，死傷多的三兩百人，少的也幾十人。誰如果去踏勘那種災塲，從相近的閒人叢中和一路扶老携幼的哭聲裏擠進去，便可見斷牆坍屋，殘烟彌漫，許多救生人員，在刺鼻的焦辣而腥臭的氣味中，拖出一段段殘缺的肢體，有的已燒成彎弓樣，有的像炭燼拌過的烤牛肉，一片模糊，面目也無從辨認。那眞是地獄的活現，呌人悽慘膽裂。</p>
<p>據上海社會局統計：從民國十六年到二十一年，六年中公共租界工廠災變，共有三百十九次，損失共一百五十六萬多兩，而法租界和華界還不在內。去年一年中，上海全市工業災變，僅據各報所載的，已有一百六十五次，死傷四百十多人，損失約在二百三十萬元以上。今年一二月份共計四十六次，死傷五十三人。三月份十一次。其中大都是爆炸或火災。像這樣災變的年甚一年，足見各方面對於工廠安全的忽視。上海工廠雖多，何難逐步自己覆滅，而一斑內地逃死的男女，好容易尋到一些血汗工作，終於給一口苦飯收拾了可憐的生命！</p>
<p>本來科學發達時，人的上下周圍完全是利器，也可以說周圍全是危險，像都市電流的分布，密如網絡，它供給行車，通信，娛樂，取凉，送暖，還有煤汽的買通，蒸汽的供給動力和室溫，吊橋，隧道，高低汽車，火車，幾十層的水泥建築……形形色色，每一樣倘不有健全的科學方法做依據，做保險，那一下子便可釀成滔天大禍。</p>
<p>那末現在這樣多的工廠，也有技師，也用科學，廠主管理人事先難道沒有防患的設備，又沒有鑒戒別人災患的設備嗎？我們仔細考察一下，便知道所謂物質科學這東西，也和政治，法律等等一樣，一到中國，便變了形，實施的結果，反應弱的，可以慢性底殺人弱種，反應强的，就一下子給你洪水猛獸，陸沉亡國。總之科學到了中國，便成了「科學禍」。</p>
<p>試把事實看看：我們國裏還是祈雨，打醮，算命，扶乩一類事件，到處風行，我們民族的頭腦，還停滯在一種模糊影響，不求甚解的形而上學的憧憬中，而沒有一般水平以上的明晰的科學頭腦。你說他不科學，他靈機一轉，立刻將科學帽子，戴在各種舊把戲上，便有科學算命，科學靈乩等出現。橫豎科學是西洋最好，要辦實業，止消買進一兩套紅毛或花旗的「洋車」（上海通俗稱機械爲車，管機人爲管車，）便好永久使用。學校的理化，也不過照書本的舉例，耍一會西洋戲法罷了，有什麼精密的觀察，有什麼眞確的了解，自然更有什麼操縱的心得。他們眼看同時同地外人工廠安全，發達，而自己老是失火，坍台，炸鍋！</p>
<p>倘使誰能到各處華商工廠一看，便可見許多工廠是因陋就簡，支棚搭架，橫七豎八，那些鋼管鐵架多是滿沾着塵灰和膏油，那些支架馬達，要使屋瓦都震震搖動，而廠屋各處，空氣惡濁，光綫不調，人工雜擠，殘料狼籍，秩序是</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>壞極了。那些廠主人，恐怕老是在想怎樣呑併股東而成獨資，經理老是在布置私人，策畫乾沒財物，利用地位，造福自己，縱然有幾個呌出科學管理法的，實際上並不懂什麼科學，不過利用時髦口號，剝削工人，欺騙東家，別有作用罷了。最可笑的，一般管理工廠的人，竟有許多連機械各部的名稱還不知道，更無論施用和保護，也不過用幾個藝徒出身的老工頭，憑十九世紀前期的經騐，來勉强運用二十世紀的新機械，而另外僱用一班警，捕，老頭子和工賊之類，內外密佈，關門落鎖，鎭壓一班馴羊。一旦慘劇發生，無路可逃，大批闔門殉難！這豈不是科學禍？</p>
<p>科學禍呀！在中國是別人所萬不致禍的會招禍。而在世界又有他的另一種禍，那就是大砲，飛機，坦克，病菌，毒氣，死光，各國正疲精竭力，研究，製造，備藏，訓練，預備給國家爭奪市塲，屠殺別國的窮氓。那又是一種科學禍，不在話下。可是今日的我們，巳來不及弔他們的大禍而要怪自己在平坦可走的大路上跌着破頭呀。</p>
<h3>暴斃者</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>天剛發亮，他就醒了。遍體是軟綿綿的，口渴得很。瞧瞧地上的妻，睡得正濃，拉開嘴，枯黃的瘦削臉，蓬亂的頭髪，那模樣兒是難看的。她已有三天沒有好好的睡了，所以丈夫不忍驚醒他免强撐起身來，但是，兩條腿跨下床來的時候，顫晃晃的沒有勁兒。彎着腰蹩到桌邊，抓起茶壺來對嘴喝了個痛快，精神似乎也振興了一點。</p>
<p>他們夫妻兩個。丈夫拉車的，妻帮人家洗衣服，免强過着吃不飽餓不死的歲月。自然，比起故鄕大水飄來之後，束手待斃的景况是高明得多少；不過他們聽過渡船頭老伯伯講的上海景緻：黃金是鋪在地面上的，祗要你有本領，早上到嚮晚便是個大富翁，所以他們不遠千里投奔到這個大都市來。現在整整的二年了，他們已認識了一切，明白了一切，這裏誰說不是個天堂，但怎不是個地獄呢！</p>
<p>他們的生活，就是地獄裏的生活！</p>
<p>像牛馬一般的勞作，誰個兒是鐵打的，丈夫病了，狂吐大瀉，這在窮人是個等死的病症，因爲他們的字典上是沒有「藥」那個字的。</p>
<p>妻子忙得三天沒有好睡，少一個人掙錢，多一個人吃現成飯，這個家庭是無論如何支持不起的。於是她日夜洗衣服，想從她的手腕上做出兼倍的丈夫腿部工作來。</p>
<p>這是窮人的命，怨不得天。</p>
<p>丈夫知道妻不是結實的個子，不要自己沒有起床，又躺倒了那個，所以他覺得精神振興一點的時候使勁揮動腿部作個拉車的姿勢，郤驚醒了地上的妻。她揉着糢糊的眼皮，席地坐起來問丈夫作什麼。</p>
<p>他提起多毛的腿來笑着回答：「有勁了！」</p>
<p>「再歇一天罷；我今天可以去收錢了。」</p>
<p>「閒着沒事做多掙一點錢不好嗎？你今天也舒適地睡一會。」丈夫再喝了幾口冷茶，已準備着出門了。</p>
<p>「那末早一點回來」。她無力的又橫下身去，沒有瞧淸楚丈夫的腿沒有從前的那股勁兒。</p>
<p>拉着空車慢慢地走，這世界似乎和他隔別許久了。太陽剛剛從東方升起，曬到身上來已沒有出門前的舒服，但接了一個遠程的生意，他鼓起勇氣向前跑了。</p>
<p>拉到目的地，汗珠像黃荳大的掉下來，喘着氣，坐在車踏上再也站不起身。就這樣昏昏沉沉的睡了一個多鐘頭，彷彿蝸牛似的他拉着空車想回家去。</p>
<p>在一家工廠門前，他被人喚住了。幾個人扶着一個隨頭的個子要他拉到紅十字會去。他告訴他們拉不動了，一個人回答：</p>
<p>「朋友，拉一趟罷，再遲一點，恐怕他要沒有命。」他指他手彎間的工人</p>
<p>像上帝的主意，他把車停到他們跟前，將病人扶上車坐定了，他就向前飛奔，幾個人跟在後面。</p>
<p>一股神力他拉得那樣快，不像一個害了三天吐瀉的人，肚子裏的一塊氣在向上升，拉得愈快愈舒適，沒有幾分鐘到了紅十字會。</p>
<p>把車停下來，那個剛才說話的工人謝了他四毛錢扶着病人向內去了。他笑着接過錢，覺得一個頭暈摔到地去，嘴裏傾刻吐出白沫來，四肢拘攣着，沒有兩分鐘就直僵僵的死去。</p>
<p>四毛錢丟在街心。這是窮人的命，怨不得天。</p>
<h3>上了古人的當！</h3>
<p>— 鴻</p>
<h3>新秋的農村</h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>天高氣爽的凉秋，已於不知不覺間，降臨到人間來了。</p>
<p>秋，是多麼可愛，多麼令人戀慕的一個季節喲！牠旣沒有像夏那樣的溽暑難熬，冬那樣的刺骨寒冷，也沒有像春那樣的乍冷乍溫，時雨時霽，使人感到齷齪不快；有的只是凉快的風，明亮的月，令人起了一種世外桃源的美感。</p>
<p>當這『已凉天氣未寒時』的秋時節，在一向很恬靜的農村裏，一到驕陽收歛了牠强烈的光熖後的夜晚，更倍覺可愛了：</p>
<p>－－天氣是那麼的凉爽，夜空是那麼的淸碧，溫柔的風，一陣陣地吹拂着碧綠的林叢，發出一種悠惋蕭瑟之聲：吱吱的鳴蟲的音波，時在林間蕩漾，耳畔繚繞；一簇簇的繁星，深箝在蔚藍的天蓋裏閃爍，吐盡牠僅有的光芒，俯照大地；一彎薄明的新月，嬌羞地斜掛在西天的一角，好像在探詢人間的秘密一樣。這時，在楊柳的濃蔭下，池塘的死水旁，常談聚着三五整天勞碌的農夫農婦。在他們中間，已不再聞着『熱呀！熱呀！……』的一些呌苦的聲音，也已不復看見下勁地搖擺着大蒲扇了；甚且，有些軀體不大健强，抵不過晚風的侵襲，在他們許多天來已是赤裸的肩膊上，竟披上一件輕薄的夾衣來。</p>
<p>在這樣一個景色下，如果獨自一個，徐步行出舉目無垠的原野外，仰頭看看天上薄明的月亮，閃爍的繁星；轉面逆迎着徐徐地吹來的溫柔晚風，任她飄着你的衣裳，拂着你的裙裾，掠過你的長髪，吹盡你腦膜間所有的一切俗氣；你實已不曉得自己還是寄身在這塵囂的人世，抑早已蹈進飄渺的仙境了！</p>
<p>我愛秋天，尤愛幽麗溫柔的初秋夜晚，我願牠永留在人間，任汚濁的人們醉倒在牠似輕烟，似流雲的柔懷裏！</p>
<h3>晚上</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>吾獨自個兒，帶着一顆負了創傷的心靈，在黃昏的途上走着，走着，走向吾的歸宿之處－家。雨後的泥路，怪濘滑的，脚踏下去，一不小心便會陷在水塘裏的，田畦裏的秋虫，在嘶聲地哀鳴；音調是那末慘悽的·隱約的犬吠聲，從耳邊掠過，一個小小的村落就映在眼前。</p>
<p>摸到了家，碰門進去，看見麗君還在煤油燈下，做着針黹等吾，沒有睡覺；她見了吾，用着驚異的目光對吾上下望了一下道：</p>
<p>「萍！今天你爲什麼這樣的氣急敗壞呀！神氣很不好呢！受了驚了嗎？」她說着去拿了一塊毛巾來，替吾揩着冷汗；吾並沒回答她，精神是感到十二分的疲倦。</p>
<p>「咳！萍！你太辛苦了！然而，吾又不能够替你分一些力量，吾儘着這樣的累你，眞對你不往……」</p>
<p>「啊！還有什麼好說？爲了要吃飯，爲了要生活祗好揑着了鼻子去受烏龜的氣！麗君！今天荃姑來過嗎？吾和她商量的事情，大約多少總有些眉目吧！」</p>
<p>「她今天來了一次，看樣子還不至一些希望都沒有。」</p>
<p>吾拖着了一個受了傷的身體，肉體上生活的鞭痕，在隱隱地發着痛楚，澈心澈肺的痛着，但吾却又不願給她看見；勉强地掙扎到房門邊，她却連忙追上來攙住了吾。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>「萍！你要水吃嗎？房裏有呀！」那時吾心窩裏一陣熱，喉間也癢得怪難過，一股腥味却從喉嚨裏衝了起來，接着便是兩聲咳嗆，終於吐出了一大口鮮血，她嚇得什麼似的，忙把吾扶到床上睡了，問吾：</p>
<p>「萍！萍！你……怎麼樣……了！不把……吾嚇……嚇死了啊」</p>
<p>她說着哭了起來，這時使吾更難過了。吾把眼睛微睜了一下，揮着手：</p>
<p>「哭什麼呀！又不會就死的：快，吾心裏怪難過呢，去替吾拿一盃鹽水來，鹽，越多越好。」</p>
<p>她拿了一盃鹽水，慢慢地對吾灌着，等吾把一盃鹽水喝完了，又問吾可再要，吾祗對她搖搖頭說：「麗君！你好睡了。」</p>
<p>「你今天好端端的怎麼會有出這樣毛病來呢？不是工作太重了受了傷嗎？」</p>
<p>麗君一壁說着，一壁給吾脫身上染滿汚泥的髒衣：但，脫去了衣服，吾那皮膚上面便給她發現了一條一條赤紫的血痕，有幾條裏邊在滲出那一絲一絲的鮮血！</p>
<p>「唷！這是什麼呀！萍！你給誰打的？這樣的傷心！唉！」吾望着她慘笑了一聲：「要吃飯啊！　！有什麼辦法？麗君。」</p>
<p>她撫着吾的傷痕，又伏在吾身上哭了，傷心的，悲哀的哭了。</p>
<p>恐懼，悲苦的空氣，充滿了整個的屋子</p>
<p>「萍！你的身子這樣，吾明天去和你請個假，好好地休養幾天吧！」</p>
<p>「是的，但是照吾們做一天吃一天的窮人，那能一天不做？一天不做工，就得一天不吃飯，現在，吾還能够掙扎一下，總得原去掙扎的，除非口眼全閉了。吐血！不是一天了，不瞞你，」</p>
<p>兩個人都默然了。夜，深沉的夜，儘管地深沉下去，這間屋子裏的空氣，也像夜一樣地深沉了下去。</p>

<h3>哥嫂虐待</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一個關於前途問題，現在特地懇求，先生犧牲些寶貴的光陰，指示我一個辦法。</p>
<p>我是一個孤苦的弱女子，我的父母生哥哥和我姊姊三人，哥哥已娶嫂嫂，姊姊亦已出嫁，我是最小，現年二十一歲，在二年前，我的父母棄世，遺產約有數萬完全由兄嫂管理，從此我就走入苦境，可憐的我在家中時常受他們的虐待，如奴隸似的，眞是非筆墨所能盡述</p>
<p>我從前曾在小學畢業，後因服侍父母的緣故，因此停學數年，平常也自修，到今年春季各校招考時，我立志要求專門學識，結果考取了專門學校，於是就向他們要學費，當時卽遭拒絕，一文沒有着手，後由親族解勸無效，無法可想，只得到各親族方面借欵，始得入學光陰飛也似的過去，一學期已過去，第二學期的學費，各親族不再借給我，眼見我又將輟學了，現在我提出幾點？（一）這樣的家境兄應否負責供給我的學費？（二）不負責怎樣辦法？（三）女子是否有承繼權？（四）出嫁與未出嫁如何分配？以上問題，請先生，在最短期間詳細的指示我，萬分感謝。順頌</p>
<p>撰安　　　　　某某謹上</p>
<p>答：你遭受到哥嫂的痛楚，確是一件不幸的事情，因爲普通人家的手足，多少總是有些情感，想不到你的哥嫂，非特不給你讀書，還要常常虐待，奴隸似的虐待，眞是異乎尋常的了。</p>
<p>不過在未答你的問題之先，有一點你要注意，就是你究竟有沒有勇氣和决心，因爲要是你沒有勇氣和决心的話，那末儘管極盡能力的答覆你，亦與事無濟，所以最重要的，還得要看你自身究竟能有勇氣去做嗎？</p>
<p>根據民國法律的規定男女的地位是平等的，所以在承繼遺產上，亦無分輕重，完全一種民法第一千一百四十一條有「同一順序之繼承人，有數人時按人數平均繼承」的規定。照編者看來，你與兄嫂已無妥協的餘地，因爲他不但對你虐待，連親族的解勸都無效，其不講情理槪可想知，你的父母旣有數萬元的遺產，可聯絡你已嫁的姊姊共同向哥哥要求將遺產作三份分派，因爲案照「已嫁女子追溯繼承財產施行細則」第一條</p>

Imamura is scheduled to leave Tianjin on the 26th. Kikuchi is scheduled to leave Tianjin for Maizuru on the 25th to take up his new post as fortress commander. On the 24th, they went to various places to bid farewell. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Imamura's Chief of Staff Takasu said that Imamura is scheduled to take the Izumo flagship to Dagukou on the 25th to observe the Japanese fleet's exercises. The date for the Japanese fleet exercises is set for two weeks, and the location is in the Bohai Sea. The Japanese warships participating in the exercises include two cruisers, four gunboats, and four torpedo boats. After Imamura observes the exercises, he will still go to Shanghai. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, Imamura, left Ping for Tianjin this morning. After arriving in Tianjin, in the afternoon, he will observe the Japanese garrison's street fighting exercises. At the latest on the 25th, he will go to Tanggu and take the flagship to Dagukou to preside over the fleet's naval exercises. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kikuchi, a staff officer of the Japanese garrison, has been transferred to the position of commander of the Maizuru Fortress. He is scheduled to leave Tianjin for Tanggu on the morning of the 25th and take the Changping Maru back to his country to take up his post. On the 24th, he went to various places to bid farewell.

<h3>Tao and Yin Arrive in Tianjin</h3>
<p>To Discuss Matters in the War Zone</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Returns to Tangshan After Completing His Tasks</p>
<p>Security Forces Stationed in Malan峪</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng arrived in Tianjin in the afternoon of the 24th to meet with Yu Xuezhong and report on administrative measures in the war zone. Yu left before the end of the military meeting, going from Tianjin to Beiping. After completing his official business, he returned to Tianjin from Beiping at 7:00 PM on the 24th. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming came to Beiping a few days ago to meet with He and also met with Chiba to discuss issues in the war zone. After completing his tasks, he returned to Tangshan this morning. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng will leave Beiping for Tianjin tonight. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming said, "I went to Tianjin to discuss matters in the war zone with the provincial government. After completing my tasks, I will return to Tangshan and plan to inspect the Yuguan area." Yin Rugeng said that the reason for the delay in the handover of the Eastern Tombs was due to traffic obstructions and the reorganization of the Eastern Tombs Management Committee. Representatives of the Qing Dynasty descendants have not yet been selected. Before the handover, I still intend to go there to inspect all the departments in detail to prevent misunderstandings in the future. A portion of the Ninth Security Company has been dispatched to Malanyu for defense and has now arrived. The rumors of incidents are unfounded.

<p>(Beiping) Chiba said, "I have contacted Yin Rugeng several times regarding the handover of the Eastern Tombs and Malanyu issues, and we have reached a general agreement. However, the handover procedures for the Eastern Tombs still need to be discussed in detail and can be finalized in a few days. Even if there is heavy rain in the Pingdong area, we will go to Malanyu by other means, at the latest within the next week. There is currently a company of the Japanese Army's Mamiy聯隊 stationed in Malanyu, a battalion of Manchurian troops stationed in the Eastern Tombs, and more than 30 members of the Hebei Provincial Security Team stationed in Mayu Town. Transportation around Malanyu is inconvenient. After I and Yin arrive there, we will go to the Eastern Tombs for inspection and formally handle the handover." (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

If both China and Japan agree, the Sino-Japanese dispute can be submitted to the International Court of Justice for resolution. However, without the agreement of one party, the International Court of Justice has no right to adjudicate. I have no opinion to express on the Sino-Japanese issue at this time. The international situation is becoming increasingly bleak, and various countries are experiencing internal economic panic and high unemployment. Therefore, international wars can still be avoided temporarily. At this time, China should strive to strengthen itself, unite, and resist foreign aggression. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Issues</h3>
<p>A Serious Protest to Japan</p>
<p>Arrests of Russian Personnel and Destruction of Road Administration</p>
<p>Fabricated Accusations with Intent to Aggress</p>
<p>The Japanese Military Issues Unprecedented Remarks without Prior Consultation</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government has officially protested against "Manchukuo's" arrest of Russian personnel on the Chinese Eastern Railway on the pretext of their involvement. It is noteworthy that the Soviet note was addressed to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, not to the Changchun government, which carried out the arrests. The note was straightforward, stating that the Japanese military's claim that the Soviet Far Eastern Army directed bandits to attack the Chinese Eastern Railway was unfounded. These arrests are nothing more than a provocation by the Japanese side, which is intensifying. Therefore, the Japanese government must bear all responsibility. Finally, the note stated, "The Soviet government firmly believes that the above-mentioned actions are carried out by the Manchurian authorities under the manipulation of the Japanese government, and therefore protests to your country." (National News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev sent a note to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on August 22, stating that "Nineteen Soviet citizens employed by the Chinese Eastern Railway, all of whom are key personnel in charge of the railway, were arrested on the 13th and 14th of this month in the eastern section of the railway. These arrests have indeed caused the eastern section of the railway to lose its road administration and have created extreme difficulties in continuing traffic. Although the railway has suffered various obstacles from the local authorities and lacks the necessary protection, it has been able to continue traffic only due to the heroic efforts of the railway staff (mainly Soviet citizens). For this illegal and unreasonable arrest, various accusations are fabricated in an attempt to justify it, claiming that the Soviet employees organized attacks on Japanese military units, organized bandits to attack trains, organized the destruction of road administration, and carried out looting, assassination, and injury to railway personnel and their families. These unfounded accusations are openly supported by representatives of the Japanese military and the Foreign Ministry. The Japanese and Manchurian authorities, regardless of their own arrest actions and fabricated unfounded accusations, also made the same accusations against official Soviet organs and representatives, such as the Soviet consulate and consul in Suifenhe, and the commander of the Red Army's Far Eastern Army. All of these actions are in line with the Japanese and Manchurian sides' destruction of the Chinese Eastern Railway and violation of the sales agreement. The Soviet government believes that it is directly related to the destruction of the Chinese Eastern Railway's road administration and the unreasonable damage to the treaty that stipulates the Soviet Union's rights over the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet government is particularly concerned about the unauthorized publication of unprecedented remarks by the Japanese military in its public statement on August 17, namely, 'The Far Eastern Special Team has ordered the organization of sabotage and attack actions.' The department then used this to accuse the non-existent Soviet Chinese Eastern Railway staff, directing bandits to attack the Chinese Eastern Railway's military headquarters, and these remarks contain the tone of an attack on the Soviet Union. The Japanese government must understand that similar and recently repeated remarks by the Japanese military, as well as the aforementioned actions within Manchuria, are all attempts by a portion of Japanese officials to strengthen their aggressive desires. The Soviet government believes that the Manchurian authorities and the Japanese government should be held responsible for the above-mentioned actions and has instructed me to submit this protest to your Excellency. The Soviet government hopes that the Japanese government will give all necessary consideration." (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministry and Military Simultaneously Issue Statements</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) [Manchukuo]'s prosecution authorities recently, on the 13th and 14th, exposed Soviet Railway Bureau employees. Regarding this case, the Soviet government suddenly sent a letter to Foreign Minister Hirota lodging a protest. The Foreign Ministry authorities then issued a statement as follows: (1) This arrest of offenders is purely [Manchukuo]'s exercise of its judicial power to eliminate anti-Manchu elements. It is a domestic issue in which others should not interfere. However, whenever such an incident occurs, the Soviet Union publicizes it widely, often claiming that the content is related to negotiations on the East China Railway and that Japan is instructing from behind, etc., thereby worsening the positions of Japan and Manchukuo. In fact, this [Manchukuo]'s investigation is entirely separate from the East China Railway negotiations. The Soviet Union's attempt to falsely link them together makes one suspect that it is trying to take advantage of something for a certain purpose. (2) The Japanese government believes that the Soviet Union's attitude this time is exactly the same as the strange document it issued last October when the East China Railway negotiations stalled, seeking to gain an advantage in resolving the issue. Moreover, the abrupt protest to Japan and its misguided behavior are truly laughable. It is determined to issue a serious rebuttal to the Soviet Union's impolite inquiry. It is also heard that the Soviet Union has protested to [Manchukuo], and [Manchukuo] will probably also respond with a protest-style reply. (24th, Japan Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The military does not regard the Soviet Union's protest regarding the arrest of Soviet East China Railway employees as significant. It will cooperate with the Foreign Ministry and is determined to rebut with factual issues and discuss other measures. The view is recorded as follows: (1) The reason for arresting the Russian East China Railway staff is based on repeated disruptions of train services (especially military trains) since the 3rd of this month. After investigating many facts, [Manchukuo] prosecuted 19 Russian railway employees. This is the beginning of the incident. (2) The timing of the arrest coincided with the breakdown of the East China Railway negotiations, which is purely coincidental. The arrest of offenders and the sale negotiations are two separate matters, which is very clear. (3) The fact that the Red Army instigated Soviet East China Railway employees was confessed by the arrested Russian employees, so there is no doubt. (4) From the above three points, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's counter-propaganda is very skillful. However, the Japanese military will, in any case, base its actions on facts and seek a solution to the problem, which is considered the most appropriate approach. (24th, Japan Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Japan Suggests to Britain</h3>
<p>Concluding a Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>(London) The Morning Post reports from Tokyo that the rumored secret agreement between Britain and Japan will become a British-Japanese non-aggression treaty. It is said that this matter was initiated by the Japanese side, as Japan initially made this suggestion to the United States but was politely refused. Britain, on the other hand, has this inclination, so diplomatic circles in Tokyo believe this is quite possible. (24th, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Russian Government Communiqué Denies</h3>
<p>Rumors of a Secret Sino-Russian Pact</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun published a report stating, "According to a report received from certain circles in Tokyo, China and the Soviet Union have concluded a secret agreement regarding Xinjiang and Mongolia." The Soviet government communiqué commented on this, saying, "Chinese newspapers have exposed that the report from 'certain circles in Tokyo' undoubtedly came from Japanese semi-official circles. Whenever news concerns anti-Soviet rumors, 'certain circles' always resolutely use various methods to worsen Soviet-Japanese relations. This company specializes in misleading public opinion, and the world knows how to judge the truthfulness of its rumors. However, it is undeniable that we still need to state that all reports, including those concerning the secret agreement between China and the Soviet Union regarding Xinjiang and Mongolia, are fabrications by well-known anti-Soviet movement organizers. Japanese responsible circles often accuse Soviet newspapers of engaging in anti-Japanese propaganda. Now we are drawing their attention to the despicable work of this news agency. Soviet newspapers do not direct any anti-Japanese propaganda, but only publish true facts and opinions clamored for by Japanese newspapers, which are all necessary for transmitting Soviet public opinion. Anti-Japanese propaganda is carried out by Japanese 'news agencies' that disseminate rumors every day. Every observer of the Far Eastern situation must ask themselves, who is behind the rumor-spreading communications agency, and what are their purposes? The answer to this question should not cause any difficulty. It will inevitably cast a dark shadow on the goals pursued by Japan. Japanese responsible personnel should stop the unpunished activities of this agency to replace the blame on Soviet newspaper propaganda. This agency will ultimately arouse people around the world against Japan." (23rd, TASS)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Joins the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Switzerland Will Not Oppose</p>
<p>(London) Newspapers reported that the Swiss government had decided to oppose Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations, which responsible parties have now denied. According to Swiss public opinion, an important part of it is campaigning against Soviet Russia's accession, arguing that the result of Soviet Russia's accession will make all countries of the League of Nations legally recognize Soviet Russia, which is a fallacy. The Swiss government has so far refused to recognize this propaganda, only stating that the government will determine its attitude after Soviet Russia formally makes a request. In general, people ultimately believe that British responsible parties are deeply afraid that Switzerland will delay its opposition until the last moment, so they have consulted with the Swiss government, requesting a more specific explanation. The official response from the Swiss government has not yet been sent to London, but according to those familiar with the Swiss government's views, there are no disputes between Switzerland and Soviet Russia that would cause Switzerland to oppose Soviet Russia. As for pure emotional propaganda, the Swiss government will not be affected by it. Therefore, when the issue of Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations is discussed, Switzerland will at most abstain from voting. (23rd, Havas)</p>

<h3>US-Russian Debt Negotiations</h3>
<p>Russia Proposes New Plan</p>
<p>Stalemate Expected to Break</p>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Russian Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, notified the State Department today that a note on resolving US-Russian debt will be submitted tomorrow. The Soviet Russian note has not yet been delivered to the State Department, so its contents have not been announced. However, it is hoped that the Soviet Russian ambassador's plan can break the week-long stalemate. Russia originally owed the United States approximately US$68.7 million and owed Britain 500 million gold yuan. Soviet Russia also demanded 200 million yuan from Britain. Soviet Russia acknowledged French debt of 73.2 million yuan and agreed to pay it off in 61 years, but in the first six years, France must lend it 120 million yuan. (24th, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Anthrax Rampant Along the Heilongjiang River</h3>
<p>Japan Claims the Soviet Union is Spreading Bacteria</p>
<p>(Harbin) Anthrax, unique to Siberia, has been very rampant recently in the area west of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, including Aigun and Beizhi Zhen. Within two weeks, 2,000 cattle and horses have died, causing great panic. As a result of the investigation of the source of the disease by military veterinarians from Harbin, it was learned that the source was in the Aigun area along the Heilongjiang River, and gradually moved south from there. From this point of view, there is indeed a suspicion that the Soviet Union deliberately spread bacteria. What kind of measures Manchuria will take after the truth is clear. (24th, Dentsu)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the U.S. Navy's return to the Pacific, the Navy authorities observed the following: (1) At a time when the naval conference is imminent and international relations are delicate, taking this kind of action is enough to stimulate international emotions and cause chaos in world peace. (2) This is a secretly intimidating attitude towards Japan, enough to stimulate China's pro-American and anti-Japanese policies, disrupt peace in the Orient, and similarly stimulate the Soviet Union. (3) Japan does not feel pain, because the Japanese Navy is thinking of defending the country, and the U.S. Navy is also mainly focused on defense, and neither is offensive. (4) Although the U.S. Navy is reduced by half, no country in the world can blockade it, so there is no need to concentrate in the Pacific. (24th, Dentsu)</p>

<h3>Another Opinion on Preventing the Outflow of Silver</h3>
<p>— Yin Pu</p>
<p>│ Advocating "Blocking Silver from Flowing into Foreign Banks"</p>
<p>Since the United States adopted a policy of raising silver prices to purchase silver, world silver prices have become increasingly strong. As a result, China's silver has experienced a huge outflow. The result of artificially raising the price of silver is that, at the same time, its overseas rise is often higher than domestic. In other words, in the process of silver price increases, overseas silver prices are often slightly more expensive than domestic silver prices. At this time, it is quite profitable to transport cheaper domestic silver abroad for sale. According to recent information (late August, 1934), exporting silver can yield a net profit of 4% to 5% after deducting all expenses such as transportation, insurance, wooden box costs, and smelting losses. (That is, every million yuan of silver exported can generate about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan in profit.) Statistics show that this year (as of August 24), the total amount of silver exported from Shanghai has reached a huge 111.5 million yuan in national currency. This export of silver has accounted for more than half of the total in the last two months. The number of exports from other ports, such as Xiamen, is not included. In a very short period of time, such a large amount of silver was exported, which can be generally seen as speculative profit-seeking rather than offsetting international payments.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the bankruptcy of rural areas in the interior of China, domestic silver has been concentrated in urban areas, and there is already a phenomenon of silver depletion in the interior. If urban silver continues to flow out of the country, then cities in the interior will also feel the lack of silver, and the financial system built on the foundation of silver will inevitably encounter difficulties first. The outflow of silver reduces the silver base, which restricts the issuance reserve. In a situation where hard currency is already scarce, the inability to increase paper currency further exacerbates the situation. As a result, currency is insufficient, and credit is contracted. On the one hand, due to financial tension, the domestic liquidity is less smooth; on the other hand, the resulting decline in prices and exchange rates will inevitably lead to industrial decline and foreign goods flooding the market. The entire national economy will therefore fall into a desperate situation. Therefore, contemporary scholars have proposed many measures to prevent the outflow of silver. However, because of different perspectives, it is difficult to reach a consensus.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, all parties seem to have fundamental errors in observation and concepts. As a result, the conclusions reached are inevitably unrealistic and not thorough. What are the errors in observation? It lies in combining the silver reserves of the domestic financial sector with the silver reserves of foreign banks without distinction. What are the errors in concept? It lies in only seeking to prevent the outflow of silver without also seeking to avoid the adverse effects of rising silver prices.</p>
<p>First, let me state the facts regarding the first point: although foreign banks and the domestic financial sector seem to have mutual transactions in normal exchanges, in reality, they have long been divided. All daily payments, except for offsetting with clearinghouse bills, must be settled in cash. If a large amount of deposits from Chinese people are transferred to foreign banks today, then the settlement result today is that some silver must flow into foreign banks. If a large amount of foreign goods arrive at the port tomorrow, and the price must be paid, then the settlement result tomorrow is that some silver must flow into foreign banks again. After this large amount of silver flows into foreign banks, it is completely separated from the domestic financial market. From then on, no matter how tight the domestic financial market is or how urgent the need for silver is, this silver that has already entered foreign banks is "once inside the noble's door," and they are indifferent to the pain. Those who enter American banks are now American silver; those who enter British banks are now British silver; those who enter the banks of Germany, France, and other countries are now the silver of Germany, France, and other countries. Sovereignty belongs to others, and we cannot intervene in their comings and goings. Therefore, I believe that it is good for foreign banks to keep silver in Shanghai, and it is also good for them to leave Shanghai. Those who stay keep their form. In substance and effect, they have already left the country by thousands of miles and are roaming in the cities of London and New York. Since we cannot steal and seize them and take them as our own, what good does it do us to keep this silver carcass on our land? Those who talk about preventing the outflow of silver today are ignorant of this point. Therefore, if we talk about imposing silver taxes, they are afraid that foreign banks will transport and store them in Hong Kong and wait for an opportunity. If we talk about banning silver exports, they worry that foreign banks will sell them to the government and temporarily store them overseas. Some even advocate contacting the US government to purchase silver in Shanghai. As if the silver purchased by the US government in Shanghai is still ours. I ask, what is the difference in substance and effect between temporarily storing US silver in Shanghai and transporting US silver to New York? This fundamental error in the observation of all parties should be explained first.</p>
<p>The impact of rising silver prices is that domestic prices fall and foreign exchange rates fall (meaning that each unit of domestic currency can buy more foreign currency). Falling prices spread the recession throughout the country. The already bankrupt agriculture has no hope of revival. The declining industry is even more in danger of collapse. Falling exchange rates reduce the price of foreign goods and increase the price of domestic goods. The country is flooded with foreign goods, and domestic goods are unsalable abroad. As a result, the national economy is in a state of internal and external difficulties and declines day by day. Therefore, the countermeasure to prevent the outflow of silver should include the effect of suppressing domestic silver prices. Otherwise, if foreign silver rises, we will use manpower to raise domestic silver prices to keep pace with it. Under this situation, domestic and foreign silver prices form a straight line. The outflow of silver may be prevented, but it will help the wave of rising silver prices and stand up to the adverse effects of this silver rise. What is that for? This fundamental error in the concept of the commentators should be explained first.</p>
<p>So, what is the strategy to prevent the outflow of silver while avoiding the impact of rising silver prices? There is only one method: "blocking silver from flowing into foreign banks."</p>
<p>The simplest, easiest to implement, and effective method to "block silver from flowing into foreign banks" is only the method of "no cash withdrawals for remittances and transfers." In extraordinary times, extraordinary methods should be used. "No cash withdrawals for remittances and transfers" is different from and actually the same as stopping the silver standard in its application. Stopping the silver standard internationally becomes a "paper currency standard"; "no cash withdrawals for remittances and transfers" becomes a "clearing account standard" or a "bill standard" internationally. In fact, it is not easy or possible to stop the silver standard in our country today. Because the power of issuance in our country has not yet been centralized, it is impossible to compile paper currency. It is also difficult to achieve centralization in a short time in reality. Therefore, it seems easier to promote "no cash withdrawals for remittances and transfers" to avoid difficulties. However, under the "clearing account standard" or "bill standard," there is one point that must be noted internally: that is, there should be a considerable restriction on withdrawing deposits or redeeming banknotes. Otherwise, if cash withdrawals of deposits or banknote redemptions can obtain unlimited cash, there is still a chance for cash to flow into foreign banks, and I am afraid it will still be of no practical help. Therefore, before implementing "no cash withdrawals for remittances and transfers," it seems that the registration of silver reserves of each domestic bank should be done first, and a public announcement should be made to gain the trust of the people. At the same time, for withdrawals (cash withdrawals can be unlimited) and redemptions, a considerable restriction should be set for those who want to withdraw cash. In this way, with decentralized reserves, it has the effect of centralization. Why can't it achieve the goal of "blocking silver from flowing into foreign banks"?</p>
<p>"No cash withdrawals for remittances and transfers" can "block silver from flowing into foreign banks"; "blocking silver from flowing into foreign banks" is equivalent to stopping the silver standard; stopping the silver standard can separate the domestic currency value from foreign silver prices; separating the domestic currency value from foreign silver prices can avoid the adverse effects of foreign silver price increases.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that to prevent the outflow of silver while avoiding the impact of rising silver prices, there is only one method: "blocking silver from flowing into foreign banks"; that is, there is only one method: "no cash withdrawals for remittances and transfers."</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Since the United States raised silver prices, China's silver has surged out, causing a major panic in the domestic silver market. In view of the continued massive outflow of silver, the banking sector and economists in this city have discussed countermeasures to prevent it. However, since this matter is complex, commentators have different opinions. For example, the article by Mr. Yin Pu above and the article by Mr. Ci Xing, "Effective Measures to Prevent the Outflow of Silver," published in this column yesterday, have quite different arguments, but each has its own unique insights. Because many people in the country are paying attention to this issue, we have specifically disclosed them one after another for comparison and reference.</p>
<h3>International Currency War</h3>
<p>Rumors of Britain's Plan to Restore the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Pound Depreciation is a Retaliation Against the United States</p>
<p>The United States Declares No Change in Gold Policy</p>
<p>(London) The international currency war has broken out in all directions. There are significant signs of this in London today. France and Switzerland purchased many francs today. Furthermore, according to reliable information, the British Equalization Fund has also moved this afternoon, selling approximately one million pounds of gold. Gold prices soared, and the pound plummeted. Experts believe that this is Britain's retaliatory action against the US's nationalization of silver and the resulting depreciation of the dollar. It is said that the pound's depreciation will prompt President Roosevelt to devalue the dollar again. London's gold prices soared today. An ounce of pure gold soared by 7.5 pence, reaching 131 shillings and 3 pence. (24th, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury experts are now closely monitoring foreign exchange rumors and their impact on the dollar, but believe that the talk of a currency war with Britain is unfounded. (24th, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that the Treasury Department's policy of allowing free export of cash has not changed. Mr. Morgenthau also said that if the dollar depreciates to the point where it is profitable to sell cash at $35 per ounce, the Treasury Department is ready to sell cash at any time. Mr. Morgenthau's declaration was issued due to rumors in New York, Paris, and other financial markets that the United States plans to devalue the dollar again. The Secretary of the Treasury also said that he is not worried about the current foreign exchange situation and does not know why people in the general banking and financial sectors are so gullible. (23rd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) All financial centers around the world today are rife with rumors about currency issues. One says that Britain plans to restore the gold standard, so the British Exchange Equalization Fund has stopped supporting the pound's exchange rate against the franc. However, the pound's depreciation does not seem likely to materialize, because insurance companies are still charging a premium of one in a thousand for insurance against the government confiscating cash or restoring the gold standard by depreciating the pound. Therefore, the British government will probably not nationalize cash or lower the price of the pound. As for the United States, according to reliable sources, the Treasury Department does not intend to reduce the gold content of the dollar to below 59.6 cents. Generally speaking, the US government's currency policy will not change before the end of this year. Financial experts believe that if the dollar is lowered now, the huge amount of money needed by the government next month will greatly affect the treasury. Economic circles here say that a large amount of cash can now be transported abroad to maintain the dollar, while the domestic situation can still be unaffected. There have already been several batches of cash exports. According to dispatches from Paris, the pound has fallen to 76.3 francs since the British Exchange Equalization Fund stopped supporting the pound. French economists predict that London will further suppress the pound's price. If so, the world will implement a currency war. Silver continues to be shipped from Britain to the United States. Since the United States nationalized silver, Britain has shipped 1,000 tons of silver to the United States. (23rd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3>British Silver Shipped to the United States Reaches 1,000 Tons</h3>
<p>(London) The American ship President Harding is scheduled to load silver worth 1.25 million pounds tomorrow and depart from Southampton, England, for New York. This is a new record for silver being shipped from Britain to the United States, with a total of 12,134 bars, which is nine more than the amount shipped on the Washington last week. This silver was transferred from London to the port of Southampton in 50 railway freight cars, weighing about 400 tons. Including this time, the silver shipped to the United States in the past half month is almost 1,000 tons. (23rd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Large Amount of American Gold Shipped to France</h3>
<p>(New York) It was learned today that the Manhattan Bank will ship gold worth 1.5 million yuan to Paris on August 25. This shipment was expected, because the value of foreign currencies has been strong recently, especially the franc. (23rd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Mussolini</h3>
<p>Looking down on Central Europe</p>
<p>Delivers a major post-exercise declaration to foreign countries</p>
<p>The rise and fall of a nation depends on military strength</p>
<p>Italy is always prepared for war</p>
<p>(Bologna) After the conclusion of the Italian army's major exercise, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini addressed foreign military delegations today, stating that no one desires war, but war can break out at any moment. We must be prepared for war; we must not wait until tomorrow but plan for today. The situation that occurred at the end of July reminded people of the situation in 1914. We immediately stationed troops on the border, which preserved the overall situation. We must train our people not to forget military affairs and to be a people united against the enemy. The rise and fall of a nation depend on military strength. All Italians must dedicate themselves to the battlefield in the event of war. The Prime Minister also stated that the terrain where this major exercise took place is very similar to Italy's eastern border. The Prime Minister's remarks are highly valued, as Italy recently sent troops to the Austrian border, and military delegations from Germany and Yugoslavia were present to observe the exercise.

<h3>Austrian Chancellor Returns to Vienna</h3>
<p>What mission did he have in France?</p>
<p>No way to find out the truth</p>
<p>Someone saw him sunbathing on the beach</p>
<p>(Nice, France) Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, who came here for rest, has now departed for Vienna. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The sudden arrival of Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg in Nice, France, has greatly surprised the French general public. Everyone wants to know what mission the Austrian Chancellor has here. If he only claims to be here for a short rest, it is hardly believable. Therefore, reporters from various newspapers automatically organized a guard this morning at 10:00 AM, surrounding the hotel where the Austrian Chancellor was staying. However, they were ultimately disappointed because the Austrian Chancellor had already left early in the morning in his secretary's car, and his destination was unknown. It was later discovered that the car carrying the Austrian Chancellor and his secretary was found on the beach in Grasse. It is said that the two spent the whole day lying on the beach sunbathing. As for the reports in various newspapers yesterday that the Austrian Chancellor would be talking with officials from France, Britain, and Romania, this has not yet been confirmed. The Paris Evening News sent a reporter to Èze to interview British Deputy Prime Minister Baldwin to inquire whether he would meet with the Austrian Chancellor. Baldwin immediately replied that he had no intention of leaving Èze so far. (Guomin News, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, several newspapers re-commented on the meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg. Most newspapers expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Italian newspapers. The Berlin Daily News stated that requesting Germany to guarantee Austria's independence may not ease the relationship between Germany and Austria. This move is merely a means, and its intention is elsewhere. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>German Socialist Party Congress</h3>
<p>Grand opening in Nuremberg at the beginning of next month</p>
<p>(Berlin) The program for the National Socialist Party's congress in Nuremberg at the beginning of September was announced today. The greatness and completeness of the group performances will be unprecedented. The Labor Service Corps will also participate in this congress on a larger scale than before. On the third day of the congress, they will be inspected by Führer Hitler and will gather at the Nuremberg parade ground to receive Hitler's instructions. 80,000 members of the National Socialist Party Youth League, 100,000 party members, and 100,000 stormtroopers will also receive instructions from Hitler in front of the grounds, and 21,000 swastika flags and 200 stormtrooper flags will be planted throughout. At the same time, a flag presentation ceremony will be held. All flags must be touched by Hitler with the blood flag from the failed Munich Putsch in 1923. A grand bonfire will be held at night.

<h3>Hitler</h3>
<p>Rounding up dissidents in one fell swoop</p>
<p>Says it has nothing to do with voting</p>
<p>Four hundred political prisoners granted amnesty</p>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign newspapers claim that the National Socialist Party has begun punishing those who voted against Hitler on August 19. The German News Agency issued a press release denying this, stating, "It is rumored that the German government will severely punish people who voted against it in the previous election, and the recent arrest of 150 people is the beginning of this action. Many foreign newspapers have published such news. According to foreign reports, most of those arrested are Catholics and Jews, who regard this as the beginning of the exclusion and abuse of dissidents. In fact, this is completely inaccurate. It is true that some communists have been occasionally arrested recently, but they are related to a long-solved conspiracy case that is being tried for endangering national security, and not people who voted against Hitler in this election. Foreign newspapers are spreading rumors wantonly in order to sensationalize, which is absolutely untrue." (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>German-Polish Trade Agreement Negotiations</h3>
<p>Allowing the exchange of military supplies in wartime</p>
<p>Will affect the Franco-Polish alliance</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Echo reports that Berlin and Warsaw have been negotiating a trade agreement for quite some time, and significant progress has been made in recent weeks. The two countries will conclude an agreement on a completely reciprocal basis, stipulating that Poland should supply Germany with food and raw materials, and Germany should export an equal amount of manufactured goods and chemicals to Poland. This agreement also includes secret clauses stipulating that in the event of war, Poland should supply Germany with food and raw materials. The Paris Echo concludes, "From this agreement, it can be foreseen that if Germany goes to war with someone, Poland will declare its independence. With such an agreement, the alliance between France and Poland will naturally be abolished, and Poland's obligations under the League of Nations Covenant will also be denied." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japan Develops European and American Shipping Routes</h3>
<p>(London) It is heard that Nippon Yusen Kaisha, based on Japan's new shipping subsidies, plans to add several fast passenger and cargo ships to the shipping routes between Europe and Asia. Because most of the company's ships on these routes are old and slow. The company also recognizes that the number of passengers and cargo between San Francisco and Japan is increasing, so it also intends to increase the number of ships on this route. It is heard that the United States is determined not to discuss subsidies at the International Shipping Chamber of Commerce meeting to be held in London in October. The United States is willing to consider the problem of surplus ships, but people in the shipping industry believe that this meeting may not have much effect. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>Cai Tingkai Arrives in New York</h3>
<p>Welcome plane crashes</p>
<p>(New York) Cai Tingkai, former commander of the Chinese 19th Route Army, arrived here on a tour of the United States. Two Chinese aviators flew to Cortis Airport today to welcome him by the sea and perform aerial displays. Unexpectedly, the two planes collided in the air, resulting in an accident. At that time, Mr. Cai had not yet arrived in port. The two aviators, one Mr. Weng and one Mr. Kang, took off and performed aerial acrobatics before heading to the sea. One of them suddenly lost control, and the two planes collided in the air. Mr. Weng's plane fell on the roof of an apartment building, and Mr. Weng was killed instantly. Mr. Kang was able to force a landing at the airport with minor injuries. Later, after an investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce, it was learned that Mr. Weng's plane had had an accident in 1932. The Department of Commerce refused to issue a pilot's license because it was unsuitable for flying. (Guomin News, 23rd)</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Ship</h3>
<p>The "Haiheng" holds a launching ceremony in England</p>

<p>(London) The "Haiheng" steamer, ordered by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in England, was launched in Glasgow today. During the ceremony, Chinese Ambassador Guo opened the Chinese national flag, and everyone bowed three times to it. After Mrs. Guo named the ship, the new ship slid into the sea amidst the sound of firecrackers. This ship has special equipment to prevent pirates. Key points are separated by iron railings, and passengers of different classes are also separated. Ambassador Guo said in his speech that the launching of the "Haiheng" is an important undertaking from the Chinese perspective and can be regarded as a revival of China's coastal shipping industry, just as the launching of Britain's No. 534 large merchant ship can be regarded as a revival of Britain's maritime shipping industry.

<h3>An expert talks about the silver issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) London believes that if China does not block silver exports, it can satisfy the United States' desire to purchase silver, and China can also increase gold imports and gradually implement the gold standard. According to an expert, China is a silver standard country, and the more silver in the country, the better. Current silver exports are harmful. If there is too little silver in the country, the turnover will be sluggish, which can easily lead to economic panic and social unrest. After the nationalization of silver, China, which uses the most silver, is even more cautious. The United States purchases silver from abroad, and Britain also purchases it secretly. If China cannot ban silver exports, a large amount will flow out. London's purchase seems to have two effects: first, if all the silver is concentrated in the United States, the European economic community will inevitably be constrained by it. Therefore, Britain is also secretly trying to buy silver from all parties to show its resistance to the United States. Second, China is the country with the most silver reserves in the world.

<h3>Japanese Rice Chemical Test Shows It Contains Toxic Bacteria</h3>
<p>Difficult to Digest, Forbidden for Consumption Even in Japan</p>
<p>Changqi Correspondence: Japan is also experiencing a severe drought this year, and rice prices are soaring. It is reported that some Japanese rice is being sold in Shanghai disguised as domestic rice. According to reports, this rice is more than 20 or 30 years old and was hoarded for military use. Because of the abundant harvests in Japan in the past two years, this old rice was sold abroad to make room for newly harvested rice. Last year, Japanese doctors chemically tested this old rice and found that it seemed to contain a kind of toxic bacteria, which caused a feeling of fullness and difficulty in digestion after consumption. The Japanese authorities had forbidden the public from eating it. Also, in February of this year, the Japanese side wanted to dump this rice on a certain country, and it was all transported to one place for storage, piling up like a mountain. Later, after the country telegraphed to refuse import, the rice was piled up in front of our consulate and customs on empty ground, reaching more than 30,000 bags. After half a month, it was moved away. (New Sound News Agency)</p>
<h3>Huang River Breach at Changyuan</h3>
<p>Reaches Shou Zhang County in Shandong Province</p>
<p>Passes Through Pu County and Fan County in Two Days</p>
<p>The Speed of the Water is Very Rapid</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River breach at Changyuan entered Shandong Province on the 21st, and passed Daokou in the territory of Pu County to Fan County on the 22nd. When the water was in Hebei Province, it was five or six inches high and thirty or forty zhang wide, and its progress was slow. After entering Shandong, the water was more than one foot high, only seven-tenths of a zhang wide, and the flow rate was five li per hour, and it could travel 120 li in one day and night. It traveled eastward along the Jin River dike, following the old path of the breach last year. Presumably, after passing through Shou Zhang, it will still enter the main river from Taochengbu in Dong'e. Fortunately, the crops along the way were not greatly damaged. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, set off on the 21st to inspect the upper reaches of the Yellow River and spent the night at Luokou. He sailed upstream on the 22nd to inspect Taochengbu. Xu Desheng, the section chief of the north bank, telegraphed the River Affairs Bureau about the situation of the floodwaters reaching Fan County. In addition to reporting to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs, the bureau also telegraphed the county magistrates of Fan County, Shou Zhang, Yanggu, and Dong'e, and the first and second sections of the north bank to be on full alert. The upstream Shaan County suddenly rose by 1.59 meters on the 21st, and the water level dropped to 293.33 meters early on the 22nd. In the afternoon, it dropped again to 292.48 meters, and the situation turned and eased. The water rose in the province in the morning and was slightly stable in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In addition, the Yellow River breach at Changyuan entered Shandong Province on the 21st, and passed Pu County to Fan County on the 22nd. At noon, it passed Fan County and flowed eastward, flowing very quickly. Today (the 23rd), the River Affairs Bureau received reports from Chengfang Committee member Ren Shaoquan and section chief Xu Desheng that the water had reached Jinjiying in Shou Zhang at Chen hour [7-9am], with a water depth of one foot and a width of more than 20 zhang. Daokou in Fan County was flooded. Also, according to a report from Yang Jifeng, the county magistrate of Yanggu County, the water reached the Jiangjia Alley in Yanggu. The Jin River dike on the north bank was firmly built, and the waves on the south bank needed to be leveled. If the water is not too high, the area north of the Jin River may be safe. In the afternoon, the River Affairs Bureau received another report from the upper reaches that the flood had reached Miaotai at the junction of Shou Zhang and Yanggu, which is 18 li upstream of Shou Zhang. Today, the water level of the entire river has increased. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, inspected the upper reaches and traveled upstream from Fan County this morning to inspect Gaodukou at the junction of Hebei and Shandong. In the afternoon, he returned to Fan County. (The 23rd)</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Relief for the Victims of Changyuan</p>
<p>Appropriates 5,000 Yuan to First Provide Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Sends Lin Chengxiu to the Disaster Area for Inspection</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Changyuan in southern Hebei has recently suffered a severe flood due to the Yellow River breach. The city of Changyuan is surrounded by four or five feet of water. Fortunately, the breach in the Yellow River levee has slowed down somewhat in the past week, and the Post-Disaster Reconstruction Office is making every effort to close it. As of the 19th, the water level on the outskirts of Changyuan had dropped by five inches. However, because Puyang is low-lying, the floodwaters from various breaches are gradually spreading in that direction. On the 20th, the county magistrate of that county telegraphed that the floodwaters were only 20 li from the city and would likely inundate the county within a day or two. The county immediately gathered laborers to build small embankments to prevent the water from rising. Yesterday, the Hebei Provincial Government received telegrams from Hu Yuanhui, Director of the Yellow River Post-Disaster Reconstruction Office, and his deputy, Sun Qingze, stating that the floodwaters at the breach were stable and that the breaches at Zhangxinzhai and Xiangli, which had been washed away, had been strengthened with willow fences. Workers were being supervised to build willow fences at the Jiugulu Jiaozhai breach. If the water level does not rise within three days, it should be possible to close the breach. The Provincial Government, in addition to telegraphed to the central government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance, reporting the dangerous situation, and requested funds to relieve the victims of the flood in Changyuan, and because Changyuan was the first to bear the brunt of the disaster, tens of thousands of victims were living in the open, crying from hunger and cold, waiting for relief, it ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to send Commissioner Wang Zhilin, together with Yang Shulin, the relief commissioner of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, to the disaster area for investigation, and ordered him to temporarily withdraw 5,000 yuan from the Changyuan branch of the Hebei Provincial Bank to provide emergency relief. The official arrived in the disaster area on the 20th to assist Changyuan County Magistrate Bu Hengxu in providing emergency relief. Representatives of the Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongguang Yellow River Disaster Relief Associations in Tianjin said that the funds allocated by the province for relief were a drop in the bucket and would not solve the problem, and on the 19th they telegraphed various departments and ministries of the central government, calling for immediate relief. Charitable organizations here will also send personnel to the disaster area for inspection within a few days, and then discuss ways to provide relief. Lin Chengxiu, Director of the Hebei Construction Department, went to Tianjin by car on the evening of the 18th to inspect the situation at the breach and then transferred to the Pinghan Road to go there. According to the Hebei authorities, there is no other way to temporarily block the breach, except to add willow fences to temporarily block it. Engineering work such as building dams with sand and stone can only be carried out after the water recedes. According to the report of the Post-Disaster Reconstruction Office, this year's Yellow River breach was mostly at the site of the breach last year. Although the Post-Disaster Reconstruction Office closed it this spring, the sandy soil was loose and the reinforcement was not strong, so it collapsed after being impacted by a large flow of water. Although this is not entirely the truth, the construction funds for the Yellow River Post-Disaster Levee really require more than 2.9 million yuan according to the project estimate, and even if the cost is reduced as much as possible, it will still require more than 2.4 million yuan. The Hebei province has sent the Director of the Construction Department to Beijing several times to face the Finance Department and state the requirements for raising funds, and requested that they find a way to allocate funds. The Ministry also intends to extend the addition of Changlu salt tax for another two years and to borrow from the banking sector. After the Hebei authorities negotiated with the banking sector, the banking sector refused because the salt tax surcharge had been used as collateral for several loans, and if it was extended for another two years, the term of the current loan would be too long and the guarantee was doubtful. In order to rush the construction, the Provincial Bank advanced 700,000 yuan three times to barely repair the embankments. There was less money and more work, and it was not easy to make it strong. Therefore, when the province appointed the Director of the Post-Disaster Reconstruction Office, they all declined because the responsibility was heavy and it was not easy to succeed. Finally, Hu Yuanhui, a member of the Provincial Committee, was appointed concurrently, and Sun Qingze, Director of the Yellow River River Affairs Bureau, was appointed as deputy. Now, it is indeed because of the lack of funds and simple work that the accident has happened. (The 21st)</p>
<h3>Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters</h3>
<p>Executes Illegal Military Officers by Firing Squad</p>
<p>For Embezzling Public Funds and Deducting Military Pay</p>
<p>Obvious Evidence of Corruption, Tyranny, and Atrocious Acts</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Shi Kun, the captain of the First Transport Brigade of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters, had been in office for two months and had embezzled public funds, deducted supplies, abused soldiers, bullied merchants, and engaged in prostitution and procuring prostitutes. Zhang Xueliang, the deputy commander, found out about this, sent personnel to investigate, and found it to be true. He was executed by firing squad on the 23rd, and a notice was sent to the military and political organs of the three provinces, announcing the crimes. The original order is as follows: The case of Shi Kun, the former captain of the First Transport Brigade of this headquarters, who was corrupt, tyrannical, lawless, and undisciplined, has been investigated by this headquarters. All the facts of the crime have been admitted without denial. In May, he deducted 108 yuan and 92 cents in supplies, embezzled 84 yuan and 77 cents from dismissed personnel, falsely reported 30 yuan and 40 cents in rice, and arbitrarily fined officials' salaries for his own benefit 14 yuan and 40 cents. In June, the amount withheld and not distributed, intending to embezzle, included 280 yuan in supplies and 32 yuan and 46 cents in falsely reported military shoes. In addition, he occupied more than 460 yuan of public funds. In total, Shi Kun, who had been in office for less than two months, deducted, falsely reported, embezzled, and occupied a total of more than 1,000 yuan. In addition, he privately set up a sales agency, operated his own business, used excuses to collect money, and sold tobacco, alcohol, grain, and fruit, forcing soldiers to buy from him, thereby greatly relaxing the prohibition on tobacco and alcohol. He also abused his power, abused soldiers, relied on his power and acted recklessly, bullied merchants, and engaged in prostitution and debauchery. Recently, he even induced a widow from the people to become his fourth wife, sent soldiers to take turns guarding her, and arbitrarily beat her, causing injury. His crimes are outrageous. At this time of bandit suppression, Shi Kun, as a military officer, should have been dedicated to his duty, abide by the law, and be honest and self-disciplined. How could he have committed so many crimes in less than two months of service? If he is not punished to the fullest extent of the law, how can we curb corruption and warn the tyrannical? In addition to executing Shi Kun by firing squad and issuing separate orders, we hereby order you to know and instruct your subordinates to know this order. (The 23rd)</p>
<h3>Jiujiang Drought Relief Association Established</h3>
<p>Severe Disaster, No Harvest</p>
<p>Submits a Request to the Government to Allocate Funds for Relief</p>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: This year's drought in our county is unprecedented in decades. Since transplanting rice seedlings, the drought demon has wreaked havoc. There has been no rain for two months, and the land is all red. The victims are on the roads, and the tragedy is extreme. The local officials and people from all walks of life held a county-wide disaster relief meeting at the Jiujiang County Party Headquarters on the 8th of this month. The congress decided to organize a special agency called the Jiujiang County Drought Relief Committee, and publicly elected 21 members, including ex officio members and standing committee members, to carry out disaster relief matters. It was officially established on that day, and Committee Member Luo Bocheng, Committee Member Xiong Bangyan, and Committee Member Xiao Mian were sent to Guling to personally meet with Chairman Chiang, Executive Yuan President Wang, Finance Minister Kong, and Provincial Government Chairman Xiong, to personally present the disaster situation and appeal for relief. At the same time, Committee Member Wu Zhenya was sent to the province to personally meet with Lu, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Relief Association, Xiong, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Wu, Director of the Department of Finance, to actively carry out the work. The presentation is copied below: "To present the extraordinarily severe disaster situation and earnestly request the allocation of emergency relief to save the people's lives. Jiujiang is mostly mountainous and is known as barren land. Droughts occur frequently, and the people's lives are difficult. This year's extraordinary disaster is unprecedented in decades. Since last winter, there has been little rain. After the spring, the ponds and weirs are dry. It is estimated that no more than 50-60% of the high and low fields in the county could be planted. Since the beginning of summer, there has been a severe drought for two months. The tens of thousands of acres have all turned red. Now that the autumn harvest is approaching, there is no harvest. Alas, what can our farmers rely on for their lives? Since the 16th year of the Republic, we have suffered from banditry, and the villages have been devastated to the extreme. Now the granaries are empty and there is no bran to eat. In ten families, several do not light fires. In one village, the smoke from cooking has been cut off for days. There are frequent incidents of families committing suicide. The sound of selling wives and pawning children is endless. At this time of impending death, if we do not appeal for relief, we fear that the 300,000 people in the county will either starve to death or go astray. Looking to the future, there is great hidden worry. Bocheng and others, seeing the urgency of the situation and being close to the capital, took the liberty to humbly beg you to consider the serious disaster situation in Xun, bestow special favor, allocate large amounts of money, distribute emergency relief, get them out of the water and fire and ascend to the mats, spread the grace over the wounds and wear the imperial heaven on the later earth, and be deeply grateful. If there is anything appropriate, it should be presented. We beg you to examine and implement it. Jiujiang County Drought Relief Committee, Director Luo Bocheng".</p>
<h3>Xiamen Pirates Rob Ship</h3>
<p>Longsheng Small Steamer Encountered Bandits Between Wutong and Aotou</p>
<p>Pirates Shot and Killed One Passenger, Losses of 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Longsheng small steamer of the Longde Shipping Company in this city, with a displacement of over 100 tons, departed from Tong'an for Xiamen at about 5 PM on the 16th, carrying 75 passengers and goods such as sugar cane, tea, taro, and longan. About 20 minutes after departure, the ship arrived near Wutongdu of Bingzhou, opposite Xiamen, between the northern inner harbor of Xiamen and Aotou. Suddenly, six passengers each took out handguns, occupied the pilothouse and engine room, and fired several shots. One bullet hit the compass in the pilothouse, and one hit the deck of the engine room. The helmsman Hong Sidu and his assistant Ye Ai were watched and forced to steer the ship eastward. The engine room was also watched by two pirates at the same time. The remaining two pirates searched the passengers by name. One of the passengers, Chen Wanlai, recognized the pirate. Because Chen lived in Shanhouting Township in Tong'an and was disturbed by bandits, he planned to file a complaint with the county government. The bandit leader Chen Tianshang found out about this and had Wanlai tied up and held for ransom. Later, the garrison troops, according to a report from Wanlai's family, sent troops to encircle and suppress the bandits, and rescued him. Since then, the bandits had been spying on him, repeatedly trying to get Chen to satisfy their vengeance. Chen then boarded the Longsheng steamer to escape to Xiamen. Unexpectedly, the pirates who robbed the ship were the same gang who had tied up Chen. Knowing that he could not escape, Chen said to a passenger next to him, "The pirates know me. I cannot avoid death. Please take this yuan as a fare. After you escape, go to Hong Benbu Yuanyuan in Xiamen and report to Hong Hongru, the chairman of the Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce, and ask him to avenge me. Chairman Hong is my maternal uncle." After Chen finished speaking, he curled up at the stern of the cabin. He was then searched out, and the bandit cursed loudly and shot him twice, once in the chest and once in the shoulder. He then kicked Chen's body into the sea. At 6:30 PM, the ship arrived at Yu Island. Because the helmsman was steering according to the pirate's directions and was not familiar with the route, it ran aground on the sand. There was already a sailboat there, and as the ship drew alongside, seven pirates also boarded the ship and fired randomly, injuring two passengers. They also searched them and moved the silver objects onto the boat, abandoning the longan and tea. They set sail towards Qiongtou, across the sea from Xiamen. At that time, it was 7 PM, and the sky was already dark. A little later, two other boats approached the Longsheng and chased after the pirate ship. When they arrived at Qiongtou, the pirates went ashore. The larger of the two boats went towards Tong'an, and the smaller one slowly towed the pirate ship. Just then, Lin Zhencheng, the head of the Xiamen Heshan Office, heard that the ship had been robbed and led detectives to chase after them on the Heqiao gunboat, using searchlights to shine around. Seeing the ship, he shouted for it to stop. The people in the boat did not respond, so he opened fire. The helmsman Yang Yin was shot and killed. The gunboat then took the sailboat and the pirate ship back. There were three people in the sailboat and two boatmen who had been tied up in the pirate ship. According to them, they were all forced by the pirates to use their boats and were forced to drive them. The Longsheng steamer waited for the tide to rise and arrived in Xiamen at 9 PM. All the passengers escaped. The Heqiao gunboat patrolled the sea between Wutong and Aotou and returned at dawn. The five people captured from the sailboat and the pirate ship included (1) Xie Shuiping, from Jinmen; (2) Lin Shui, from Tong'an; (3) Wang Chao; (4) Wang Zhang; (5) Cai Yong. According to them, they were all boatmen who were forced by the pirates to use their boats and were forced to drive them. The corpse was examined by the court. According to the passengers, the two sailboats that arrived later seemed to be reinforcements from the pirates. The larger one went to Tong'an, and the smaller one took the sailboat away, which seemed to have been left behind by the pirates. According to the Heshan Office's investigation, Yang Yin, who was shot and killed, was indeed a pirate who robbed the ship. Also, Xie Shuiping, Lin Shui, and Cai Yong, three of the five people arrested, were identified as pirates by the passengers. No one identified Wang Chao and Wang Zhang, who were indeed tied up at the time. The total loss on the ship was all the silver objects carried by the passengers, totaling approximately 3,800 yuan.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<h3>Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Please Investigate the Case of Corruption in Land Tax</p>
<p>To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan, Chairman Jiang of the Nanchang Branch, and Chairman Chen of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government: In the case of the Songjiang converted land tax, the county magistrate Jin Tigan included the northern part of the Pu area into the southern part of the Pu area when applying for tax reduction, which is already a breach of duty. After the application for tax reduction was approved last year, he did not cancel the printed strings, issue announcements, or return the floating mortgages. Instead, he deducted more than 10,000 piculs of tax rice from the actual collection amount and the uncollected amount of the autumn survey each year, which is obviously intentional behavior. He colluded with the chief of the finance section, Che Zhao, and the director of the eastern counter collection, Ye Zongcheng, to embezzle more than 3,000 piculs of converted land tax from the northern part of the Pu area and 2,000 piculs from the southern part of the Pu area (originally 7,000 piculs, calculated based on 2,000 piculs collected) from the 18th to 21st years of the Republic, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. He also concealed 60% of the tax silver in the northern part of the Pu area and the hinterland of the southern part of the Pu area in the 22nd year (only 40% was remitted out of 100% actually collected), totaling more than 10,000 yuan. The facts are clear and the evidence is solid. He used the benevolent policies of the provincial government and the blood and sweat of farmers as a hunting ground for corruption and embezzlement. If this is not punished, where is the national law? The case involves embezzlement of public funds, and we dare not remain silent. We specially telegraph to request your Excellencies to punish according to law, so as to warn corrupt officials and emphasize national taxes. Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai, Zhang Shutong, Ma Yinliang, Wang Yaoqin, Wang Qingsheng, Qiu Hongzhang, Zhang Zunan, Qian Dingda, Lu Hongsheng, Zhang Yiping, Li Menggeng.</p>

<h3>Construction Bureau Laying Telephone Lines in Meicun</h3>
<p>The provincial long-distance telephone exchange office at the Tonghui Bridge has a rural telephone attached, and there are more than a dozen places in the four villages that have telephones connected to the switchboard. Recently, Meicun Town in the New Second District felt that there were many residents and that news was slow in the event of important events. It was urgent to add rural telephones. Therefore, a request was submitted to the county government and forwarded to the Construction Bureau. Construction work has begun immediately, and the cost is shared by the rural area and the government. The Construction Bureau has now approved it and sent personnel to Wuxi to work with the Construction Bureau and the exchange's engineering staff to start construction.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Association Requests Reduction of Grain Business Tax</h3>
<p>The joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Association was held in the Gongyi Hall and Qiangzhai in Wujiang County this session. Fifty committee members attended, chaired by Yu Xiaochuan. The following key issues were resolved: (1) Grain is related to the people's livelihood. Currently, the drought is extremely severe, grain prices are soaring, and the business tax is being collected urgently. The association will continue to petition the provincial government to find ways to reduce it in order to maintain the people's livelihood; (2) Various exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in various counties have been abolished by explicit orders, but the egg tax in Suqian County and the education rice tax collected on behalf of Wujiang County are onerous and burdensome. The association will immediately petition the provincial government to abolish them together; (3) It is reported that Jiangsu Province is issuing 30 million public bonds, and merchants will bear the brunt. At this time of popular poverty and financial exhaustion, and market decline, it is difficult for the people of Jiangsu to bear the burden. A telegram should be sent to the national government and various ministries to stop it immediately, and a telegram should be sent to the newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai to disclose the article for discussion in its original form, in order to arouse the attention of the people of Jiangsu; (4) Since the implementation of the new tariff, the import tax on cotton yarn and cotton fabrics has been reduced a lot, while the tax on hardware and machinery has increased, which has a great impact on the promotion of domestic goods and industrial and commercial enterprises. A petition should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry for review; (5) It is reported that a large amount of cash is being exported recently. National cash is like the blood of the human body. The outflow of blood will inevitably lead to depletion and death. Not only will the currency reserves be panicked, but all industries will perish with it. A telegram should be sent to the Economic Commission of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to find ways to stop it quickly.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Hall Committee Comes to Changzhou to Solicit Products</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has scheduled the Southeast Transportation Exhibition to be held in Hangzhou on October 10.

The best of the goods will be transferred to the Transportation Exhibition for display, and the goods from various counties are limited to be sent to the exhibition before September 5. Now the Construction Bureau believes that the deadline is approaching, and the goods sent by various counties are few. It specially sent a member, Chen Qiyuan, to Changzhou, who contacted the county government and the Chamber of Commerce on the 23rd, and discussed the plan with Shi Ziquan and Lin Jun, the directors of product collection in Wujin. It was decided to convene a meeting of various product agencies at Dengri to collect products at any time and send them to the exhibition for display on schedule. Chen also took a car to Wuxi that night.</p>

The local police reported it to the local sub-court for inspection. It was verified that the deceased was shot to death during her lifetime, and it was also found that the corpse was Zhu Erbao, from Pinghu. It is unknown why she was murdered here. After the corpse's mother, Zhu Wu, identified the corpse, she filed a petition with the court to arrest the murderer and punish them, as her daughter was shot to death and it was premeditated, and she died so tragically.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Major Battle Between Tax Police and Salt Smugglers</p>
<p>Most of the residents along the coast of this county and Haiyan County live by selling salt. As the autumn harvest is hopeless this year, they gathered in large groups to load salt for export. The captain of the Changchuan Dam tax police team, Hong Yishan, heard about it and sent seven soldiers to block the Ma'anshan pass. As expected, more than 300 salt smugglers were found in groups passing through the area. Knowing that they were no match, the soldiers let them pass. When there were about thirty or fifty burdens left, they fired blank shots to try to intercept the tail salt. When the salt smugglers heard the gunshots, they immediately returned, each holding sharp knives and carrying poles, surrounding the mountain and wanting to get the soldiers to be satisfied. The soldiers fired more than 100 shots in a chaotic manner, but it was still difficult to escape the danger. At this time, the sound of gunshots was faintly heard from Changchuan Dam. Captain Hong knew that something had happened and immediately transferred the nearby team and negotiated with the army units stationed at the dam for assistance. They rushed to rescue the soldiers. One salt smuggler and one woman from a nearby residence were killed, two people were captured alive, and more than 40 burdens of smuggled salt were taken back to the team. Before the deployment was completed, a report was suddenly received that the salt smugglers vowed not to give up and had gathered in a certain place, threatening to counterattack the team headquarters. The residents of Changchuan Dam were afraid that the entire town would be ruined and had sent several representatives to persuade the salt smugglers, seeking a peaceful solution, but no confirmation had been received as of press time.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Transportation Envoy Borrows Money to Build Salt Warehouses on Four Banks</p>
<p>The dispute over the Twelve Wharf sail transport has been brewing for years and has not been completely resolved. According to news from the Salt Affairs Department, Transportation Envoy Miao had long drafted a plan. After the sail transport at the Twelve Wharf is cancelled, the ships will directly arrive at the four banks. The locations of the salt warehouses on the four banks have also been selected, including (1) three locations on the Xiang bank, Yuezhou, Changsha, and Hengyang; (2) two locations on the E bank, Hankou and Xindi; (3) two locations on the Xi bank, Jiujiang and Zhongxing; (4) two locations on the Wan bank, Datong and Wuhu. For the salt warehouse expenses, a loan of ten million has been taken from the Shanghai Banking Group, with sixty percent used for building warehouses and forty percent used for handling the Twelve Wharf construction, and for building bundles of bagged salt hemp bags.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Establishes Jiangbei District Branch</h3>
<p>Shanghai Bank has a branch in Yangzhou. In order to expand its business and centralize Jiangbei finance, it plans to expand the branch into a Jiangbei District Branch. Cai Yunxun, the manager of the Zhenjiang Branch, has been decided to be appointed as the manager. The head office has now drafted this plan in detail and it will be implemented at the end of this year. At that time, the bank building will still need to be rebuilt.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Floating Fire at Pier Causes Fatality</p>
<p>The Hongxing Shipping Company on Binjiang Road in this port held a fire-releasing ceremony at its pier at 7 pm last night (22nd) according to custom. For a time, gongs and drums were loud, and pedestrians flocked to the event. Ni, the wife of the lacquerer Sha Dulai, who lived at the Shizi Well Intersection, also went to watch the event at about 8 pm with her daughter, Ensi. Because there were mountains of people watching, the mother and daughter stood on the small pier. Ensi was small and could not see the whole picture, so she crossed from the small pier to the big pier. However, because the distance was about one foot and the child was weak, she accidentally lost her footing and fell into the water, drifting away with the tide. By the time her mother noticed and called for help, she was gone. At this time, Ni was heartbroken and tried to commit suicide by throwing herself into the water. Fortunately, she was rescued by onlookers and did not drown. After the incident, the patrol police at the scene took Ni to the bureau, ordered the monks to stop chanting, and took the bookkeeper of the Hongxing Shipping Company, Geng Zhiqing, to the bureau for questioning. He was temporarily released on bail to await summons. What happens next, please wait for a follow-up report.</p>
<h3>Major Fire on Baizhang Road, Jiangdong</h3>
<p>The Hengchangxiang Nanhuo Shop at No. 36 Baizhang Road, Jiangdong, in this port suddenly caught fire downstairs at about 11 pm last night (22nd). For a time, the fire was fierce and unapproachable. It was not until after 12 o'clock that it was extinguished. The victims included Yuanshun Butcher Shop, Cuisheng Paper Shop, Ganhe Salted Goods Shop, Xiangmao Fruit Shop, Yanchunyuan Restaurant, Wang Dexing Secondhand Shop, Jishantang Pharmacy, Daiyuanxing and Xin Dasheng Iron Shops, Lu Yinhua Eye Clinic, and many residents. More than thirty houses were burned down, and the loss reached about 100,000 yuan. Zhang Yousheng, a 15-year-old apprentice at the Hengchangxiang Nanhuo Shop, suddenly disappeared after the fire broke out. It is feared that he was too young to escape and was buried in the fire.</p>

<h3>President Wang</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing Last Night</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, left Nanjing on the night express last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>The Situation Between Japan and Russia Becomes Increasingly Urgent</h3>
<p>U.S. Warship Sails from Qingdao to Shanghai</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Sail to Dalian</p>
<p>Planes Sent to Harbin</p>
<p>The Greater American Daily News reports that the U.S. naval flagship Augusta, under urgent orders, sailed from Qingdao to Shanghai this afternoon and is expected to arrive tomorrow, followed by two destroyers. However, this information has not been verified by official sources. Unverified news received in Shanghai this morning from Manchuria claims that the Japanese government has dispatched 30 warships to Dalian and 70 bomber planes to Harbin. It is believed that these actions are closely related to the stalemate in negotiations between Russia and "Manchukuo" regarding the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which has led to a tense situation. When inquired about this matter at the Japanese consulate this morning, a spokesperson replied that the statement may be partially true because the Japanese army and navy are currently conducting large-scale maneuvers in the Dalian and Shanhaiguan areas. Airplanes would naturally participate in large-scale army and navy maneuvers. However, the spokesperson denied that the actions of the warships and airplanes had any connection with the tense situation between Russia and "Manchukuo," stating that neither Japan nor Russia is preparing for war. The spokesperson also mentioned the discord between Russia and Japan, stating that Japanese authorities discovered on August 13th and 14th a conspiracy by a five-member Soviet Russian military delegation to attack the office of the Japanese military delegation at that location. The Japanese and "Manchukuo" newspapers have given this matter extensive coverage, and the Soviet Russian government has not denied it, as it usually does. Furthermore, the "Manchukuo" authorities arrested Soviet Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway for colluding with bandits to destroy Japanese trains transporting soldiers and military supplies, and the Soviet Russian government has not protested. The silence of the Soviet Russian government on both cases is sufficient proof that it is aware of its own wrongdoing.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of Confucius' Birthday</h3>
<p>Central Government Orders Factories to Close</p>
<p>Local Party and Government Actively Preparing</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the 27th of this month is the anniversary of the birth of Confucius. The central government has already passed a resolution designating it as a national memorial day. Upon receiving the order, the local party and government organizations immediately began joint preparations and decided to hold a commemorative meeting at 10:00 AM on that day in the Great Hall of the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road. All agencies, organizations, and factories in the city will be closed for one day. In addition to sending one representative to participate in the commemorative meeting, all schools will hold separate ceremonies to commemorate the event. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Proposed List of Officials for the General Assembly</h3>
<p>The presidium of the commemorative meeting is planned to have seven members: (1) Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Headquarters; (2) Wu Tiecheng of the Municipal Government; (3) Yang Hu of the Municipal Security Bureau; (4) Tao Baichuan of the Municipal Education Association; (5) Yu Zuoting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; (6) Zhu Xuefan of the Municipal General Labor Union; (7) Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Farmers' Association. Recorder: Tong Muge. Master of ceremonies: Zhang Hanyun. The Municipal Government will be responsible for hospitality. The Publicity and Investigation Sections of the Municipal Party Headquarters will be responsible for security. The Municipal Police Bureau will send a military band to provide music and dispatch police to maintain order at the venue.</p>
<p>(Schools Commemorate Separately) All major and minor schools in the city regard Confucius as the founder of our country's education system. The memorial measures prescribed by the Central Government should be grand ceremonies to show respect. In addition to sending representatives to participate in the commemorative meeting of party and government organs, they will also hold separate ceremonies at the same time, reporting on Confucius's actions of diligence and love of learning, and hoisting flags for a day off to celebrate. Because the time is approaching and it is also the start of the school year, preparations are very busy.</p>
<p>(Telegram Orders Factories to Close) Although the Central Government has designated this Confucius' birthday as a national memorial day, the Municipal Party Department of this city believes that there are no explicit regulations on whether all factories in the country should be closed. Therefore, it telegraphed the Central Government for instructions a few days ago. It is heard that the department received a reply from the Central Government last night, stating briefly that for the Confucius' birthday memorial, the Central Government has decided that all agencies, organizations, and schools will be closed on this day, and factories should be no exception. After receiving the order, the department immediately notified the relevant organizations and factories throughout the city that they should follow the usual national memorial day procedures and close for one day.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Arrives in Shanghai to Talk</h3>
<p>Went to Qufu Last Night to Worship Confucius</p>
<p>Recent Important Political Matters in Nanjing</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, took the night train to Shanghai the night before last, arriving at the North Station at 7:30 yesterday morning, and went directly to his private residence on Avenue Albert to rest. Chu came to Shanghai to handle Sino-French school affairs and is scheduled to take the night train back to Nanjing that evening. He will go to Qufu tonight to worship Confucius. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Chu yesterday morning and had the following conversation:</p>
<p>(Going to Qufu to Worship Confucius) According to Chu, the 27th is the birthday of the great teacher Confucius, and the National Government has specially appointed Ye Chucang to preside over the worship. Of the five Yuan Presidents, in addition to Wang and Dai being in Nanjing, Sun, Ju, and Yu have all left Nanjing due to matters. Wang and Dai must also remain in Nanjing to preside over the joint commemorative ceremony held by the Central Government and the National Government. Therefore, it was decided that each of the five Yuan would send one representative to accompany the worship in Qufu. I am scheduled to return to Nanjing on the evening of the 24th, and at 7:00 on the 25th, I will take the Pukou-Pingpu train to Jinan and then go to Qufu to represent the Executive Yuan to accompany the worship. I should be able to return to Nanjing around the 28th.</p>
<p>(The Mission of the New Prince Coming to Nanjing) Minzhu Ce Wangduoji, the Prince of Torghut in Xinjiang, was ennobled during the Qianlong era of the former Qing Dynasty and was stationed in Usu. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, he left Xinjiang for Tibet and then came to Nanjing via India. He carries the orders of Sheng Shicai and has something to discuss and has drafted articles to be presented to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for suggestions to promote communications in the border area. The Prince of Mongolia has established an office in Nanjing to avoid isolation. I hosted a banquet to welcome him on the 23rd and had a very pleasant conversation.</p>
<p>(Coping with Silver Exports) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee has decided to convene as scheduled and is actively preparing. As for the rumors that the Central Government is sending personnel south to urge the Central Executive Committee members in the southwest to come to Nanjing to attend the meeting, I have not heard anything about it. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek suffered from a minor illness but has now recovered. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for coping with the problem of large silver exports. The situation in Fujian is peaceful. Market rumors are not credible.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was the Hottest Day After Autumn</h3>
<p>Highest Temperature Reached 100 Degrees</p>
<p>Hurricane Lingers and Does Not Advance</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the climate in Shanghai has been unusually hot this summer, with no rainfall, causing damage to agriculture and creating a disaster. The general public originally hoped that the arrival of autumn would bring some relief from the intense heat. However, since the beginning of autumn, not only has there been no rain, but the temperature has remained high. As a result, the hopes for a partial autumn harvest in the surrounding countryside are fading away. The reporter inquired at the Shanghai Observatory yesterday and was told that yesterday's temperature was the hottest in recent days, with a maximum of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and a minimum of 76.1 degrees Fahrenheit. There were no clouds in the sky, and the air pressure was not low, so there were no signs of rain. As for the hurricane in the Pacific Ocean, it continues to blow towards the coast of China, which may bring cooler temperatures in the near future. However, according to a report received at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane had blown to 18 degrees North latitude and 131 degrees East longitude, with the wind direction being northwest. However, a report received at 2:00 PM stated that it had stalled. Furthermore, it was found that the hurricane's force was not very strong, so it is not possible to predict whether the wind will blow to the coast and whether the temperature will cool down within days.</p>
<h3>It is Said That Kong Xiangxi Will Convene Another Silver Meeting</h3>
<p>Bankers Deny It</p>
<p>Believe There Is No Need to Hold a Meeting</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that yesterday there were rumors that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi was convening another silver meeting in Guling, and that bankers were rushing to Lushan. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency specifically visited the banking community yesterday to inquire about the situation, and all denied that this was the case. Furthermore, Xu Kan, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, has not left Shanghai, which further proves that the rumors are untrue. According to a certain important person, the government is unwilling to take any action on this matter, as it would only cause more suspicion. Therefore, there is absolutely no plan to convene another meeting of bankers, and there is no need to hold a meeting. It is quite troublesome to investigate whether there is silver being exported every day and how much. However, the more silver that is exported, the tighter the silver supply in the country becomes. The extent of the tightness of the silver supply can be seen from the amount of the silver discount. It is said that when the tide rises, the boat also rises. Before the rural economy was concentrated in the cities, the Shanghai silver dollar discount was above one jiao. Since the rural economy has collapsed and silver has gradually concentrated in the cities, Shanghai has had a surplus of silver, and the silver discount has also decreased accordingly. The Money Industry Association had a record of a minimum interest rate of four fen in June and July of this year. Yesterday, it had risen to one jiao and five fen. The process was roughly: on August 1, the silver discount was seven fen, on the 17th the discount was eight fen, on the 20th it had risen to one jiao, on the 21st it was one jiao and one fen, on the 22nd it was one jiao and three fen, and on the 24th (yesterday) it was one jiao and five fen. It is heard that the money industry has set a limit of no more than seven jiao for the discount, but during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the silver discount once rose to more than eight jiao.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui</h3>
<p>Went to Jiangxi to Meet Chiang the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Left Shanghai on the Wuchang Steamer</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui, a judge of the International Court of Justice, had been in Shanghai for several days, with frequent social engagements. Due to an urgent telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, he took the Taikoo Company's Wuchang steamer at 5:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 23rd) and left Shanghai for Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on everything. Wei Daoming, former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, also accompanied him. According to those around Wang, Wang will stay in Jiangxi for about a week and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yu Shun Expected to Arrive Today</h3>
<p>Smooth Sailing Allowed for Quick Arrival</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yu Shun steamer lost its propeller in the waters off Fuzhou. The company dispatched the Wu Yang steamer to tow it. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Sunday morning. At noon yesterday, the company received a follow-up telegram from the Yu Shun stating that after the Wu Yang steamer towed it from Matsu, the journey had been smooth and the speed had been increased, so it was expected to be towed to Wusong on the afternoon of the 25th. After arriving in Wusong, it is planned to detach the Yu Shun and proceed to port first. The company will send another small steamer to tow the Yu Shun into the Huangpu River outside the port of Wusong, stop at the South Wharf, and transfer the cargo from each hold to the Wu Yang before entering the factory for repairs. None of the cargo on board was damaged. The company has informed all cargo owners and insurance companies.</p>
<h3>Depression in Yangtze River Shipping</h3>
<p>Foreign Ships Manipulate Freight Rates</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Are Greatly Threatened</p>
<p>Combined Transport Cannot Be Realized</p>
<p>The Yangtze River route has always been the best route for various shipping companies, with the most cargo transported up and down the river. The six companies operating on the route used to be profitable every year, but this year, the volume of cargo traveling up and down the river has plummeted. In addition, the Land and River Navigation Bureau is handling combined land and water transport, so foreign merchant ships on the route, in order to prepare for the worst, have drastically lowered freight rates in an attempt to undermine the situation, leading to the current state of extreme depression in the Yangtze River shipping business and hindering the realization of the Pinghan combined transport. This matter is closely related to the shipping industry, so the current situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Few Goods, Many Ships Currently, there are six companies operating on the Yangtze River route: China Merchants, Sanbei, Ning Shao, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nisshin Kisen. The number of ships operating has decreased by five or six compared to before the January 28th Incident (referring to the Shanghai-Hankou section). For cargo traveling upstream from Shanghai to Hankou, the six companies still maintain the same pace and are not allowed to increase or decrease rates without authorization. However, the freight rates for cargo traveling downstream from Hankou can be increased or decreased independently. This year, due to the impact of the depressed market, the volume of cargo traveling up and down the Yangtze River has decreased significantly. Some ships have only been loaded to 30-40% of their capacity, so the feeling is that there are many ships and few goods. Jardine Matheson intends to sell its Lianhe ship, and Nisshin Kisen has repeatedly wanted to restore its four ships that have been suspended for a long time, but has stopped due to a lack of cargo to transport. The China Merchants' plan to add two Jianglun ships has also been shelved.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Lower Prices Since the China Merchants and Pinghan Railway reached an 18-article draft agreement on combined land and water transport in March of this year, it has been five months, and it has been said that it will be implemented, but it has not yet been realized. However, since this incident occurred, foreign merchant ships operating on the Yangtze River, such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nisshin Kisen, have been deeply concerned that they will be severely hit after implementation, as all downstream cargo will be converted to combined transport. Therefore, without waiting for its implementation, they have repeatedly reduced the freight rates for cargo transported from the Yangtze River to Shanghai and for cargo transferred from the Yangtze River to Xiamen and Guangdong, not just once. So far, there have even been cases where the downstream cargo freight rates have been reduced to only 30% of the original price. The foreign merchants' intention is that rather than letting the ships travel empty, they would rather lower the freight rates and load the ships, which has led to a disruption of the freight rates. Chinese ships feel threatened by this, and no trip up or down the river is without losses, leading to an unprecedented situation on the Yangtze River for decades.</p>
<p>Each Ship Loses Money This year, none of the Yangtze River ships of any company can make a profit. Foreign companies have accumulated vast wealth and reserves over the years and have already budgeted for losses. Chinese shipping lines are suffering from this blow and are finding it difficult to sustain themselves. Currently, according to precise calculations, the various expenses for a round trip of a ship for ten days are at least 7,000 yuan, while the average income from cargo and passengers traveling up and down the river is at most 5,000 yuan. Therefore, each trip loses between 1,000 and 2,000 yuan. Therefore, Chinese shipping lines urgently need the combined transport to be implemented as soon as possible to save the situation.</p>
<p>Hinders Combined Transport Although the Pinghan combined transport is about to be completed by both the railway and shipping sides, the most difficult point is the freight rate. According to Article 5 of the contract, the combined transport freight rate is determined according to the lowest rate of each shipping company. However, the foreign shipping lines have already lowered their rates to below cost, making it impossible to determine the combined transport freight rate to date. If the current prices are charged, both the railway and shipping sides will lose money. Therefore, the railway and shipping authorities are hesitating greatly. According to Zhou Fengtu, who is in charge of the combined transport, it is difficult to say whether the Pinghan Railway combined transport can be realized on September 15th. If the freight rate problem is not resolved, this matter cannot be discussed at all. According to Zhou, it will probably be difficult to start in mid-September. The issue of Sanbei and Ning Shao sending ships is still under discussion.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Fellow Provincial Association</h3>
<p>Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Use of Foreign Capital</p>
<p>The Principle of Using Foreign Capital to Develop Industries Was Approved</p>
<p>A Treaty Research Committee Was Formed to Study the Documents Signed by Both Sides</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai, in response to the Juxingcheng Bank's use of foreign capital to develop industries in Sichuan Province, held an executive committee meeting at its office on Shandong Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than a dozen people attended, including Tang Zhonghou, Wu Guoliang, Liu Xueqiao, Li Xunfu, Zhong Hangsu, Li Chongpu, Wu Youdan, Qiu Zhizhong, Yu Yuanhui, Deng Youguang, and Tan Jiqing. Li Xunfu chaired the meeting, and Wu Guoliang recorded the proceedings. After the formal opening, the chairman reported on the situation of Juxingcheng's use of foreign capital, and executive committee member Yu Yuanhui, who is also the deputy manager of the bank, reported on the five points of the process (the same as the five points reported in the newspaper, so they are omitted). The discussion of each case then began as follows: (1) How should this association express its opinion on the Juxing Bank's use of foreign capital? (Resolution) A. Under the conditions of using foreign capital to develop industries in Sichuan Province without harming sovereignty, the Juxing Bank's use of foreign capital is approved. B.

C. The Juxingcheng Bank will be requested by letter to send all documents related to this matter to this association, and the special committee will study them. (2) What should be done about the telegram from Liu Xiang, the Director of Sichuan Post-Disaster Relief, requesting assistance due to the severe drought and flood situation? (Resolution) A. A telegram will be sent to the government requesting the allocation of funds for disaster relief. B. A reply will be sent to Director Liu Xiang. (3) Committee members Liu Xueqiao, Tang Zhonghou, and Qiu Zhizhong requested that the association's public welfare committee member Yin Daoxin be sent back to Sichuan to investigate the economic situation and industrial conditions. (Resolution) Passed. Other cases were omitted. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Today There Are</h3>
<p>4.7 Million Silver Dollars Being Shipped to America</p>
<p>Loaded onto the British Steamer Sun Bound for New York</p>
<p>The Total Exceeds 10 Million in Nine Batches</p>
<p>36 million silver dollars were just loaded and exported by various foreign banks three days ago. Yesterday afternoon, various foreign banks reported loading another large batch of silver dollars, totaling 4.7 million yuan, consisting of a mix of large silver bars, silver coins, and foreign currency. They contacted the British firm Jardine Matheson, which loaded the cargo onto its express steamer Sun, bound for New York. The cargo was transferred onto the ship in the afternoon. First, it was transported by truck to the New Customs Wharf, and then transferred to the Sun by barge, where it was hoisted into the silver storage. It will leave Shanghai this morning and is expected to arrive in New York in 34 days. This is the ninth batch of silver dollars being exported. It is said that there will be a tenth batch that will need to be shipped within the week. Since May, a total of nine batches of silver dollars have been shipped from Shanghai to foreign countries, totaling over 100 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Prolonged Drought Causes Rice Prices to Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Reconsider Rice Price Controls</p>
<p>The drought in the interior has worsened in recent days, causing grain and rice prices to skyrocket and shipments to be scarce. Rice prices in Shanghai have also risen. It is said that the Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to investigate and will convene another meeting to discuss rice price controls. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangbei Bumper Harvest This year, the rice production in areas such as Rugao, Tongzhou, Huai'an, Gaoyou, Shaobo, and Dongtai in Jiangsu Province has been very abundant, and prices are low. As a result, rice merchants from various places are rushing to purchase, causing prices to rise. In recent weeks, the drought in areas such as Wuxi, Suzhou, Pingwang, Tongli, and Changshu has worsened, and the rivers have dried up, causing the rice to wither. As a result, people are panicking and hoarding food, and grain prices have risen from 5.7 yuan to 6.5 yuan per shi. Two shi of grain are equivalent to one shi of rice, and it costs 14 yuan to transport top-grade rice to Shanghai. Shipments are also not strong.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate In order to stabilize rice prices, the Social Affairs Bureau previously convened rice industry groups to agree on a maximum price of no more than 13 yuan. However, at that time, people were panicking, so although the surface price was 13 yuan, the actual price was above 13 yuan, with the highest reaching 13.8 yuan and the lowest being 13.4 yuan. Now that rice prices in the interior have risen, the controlled price of 13 yuan is no longer enough to cover the cost by more than one yuan. Therefore, rice merchants are also very panicked and have repeatedly requested the Social Affairs Bureau to revise the price. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhou Minggang, a staff member of the Fourth Section, to investigate the north and south markets yesterday morning and is said to be planning to hold a meeting on the 28th to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Continue to Rise According to Jiang Shizhi, Chairman of the Rice and Grain Merchants Association, when the authorities controlled prices, Saigon rice was selling for only 10 yuan per 200 pounds, but now it has risen to 12 yuan. The price of 8.5 yuan per dan for guest xian rice has already risen to 11 yuan. Currently, top-grade zheng white rice is in short supply, and second-grade rice is selling for 13.3 yuan. First and second-grade japonica rice is selling for 12.8 yuan. The government's prestige should be maintained, but the facts must also be considered. The current price increase is due to the lack of rain.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Plans Relief After purchasing 100,000 shi of Hunan Wuhu japonica and small Jiaomi rice from Shanghai, the price of rice in Zhejiang Province remained high. Therefore, the local rice industry is still continuing to purchase from Shanghai. An average of about 5,000 bags are transported from Shanghai to Hangzhou every day. As of yesterday, 200,000 bags of Shanghai rice have been transported to Zhejiang, and purchases and transport are still being made every day. Recently, the Shanghai rice industry has been entrusted to order 100,000 bags of forward rice from Saigon, with delivery scheduled for next month in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Zhangzhou Rice Is Suspicious As for the Zhangzhou rice shipment to Shanghai, which various circles suspect, according to people in the rice industry, Tokyo's round-grain japonica rice and Dujian rice are similar to the japonica and Jian rice of Jiangsu Province in our country, making it difficult to distinguish them. It is not easy for those who are not familiar with this industry to distinguish them. Taiwan and Zhangzhou have never had rice come to Shanghai, so it is difficult to imagine what it looks like. However, it is also easy to distinguish between new rice and old rice, because new rice is green in color and tender and soft, and it is easy to break when crushed by hand. Old rice is pure in color, dry and hard, and not easy to crush.</p>

<h3>The Glory of Domestic Goods Sold in Europe</h3>
<p>Calcium Carbonate Produced by Zhaoxin Chemical Factory</p>
<p>The Zhaoxin Chemical Factory, located at Jinjiazhai, West Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, has been in operation since last year. Its chemical raw materials, such as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate, are well-received by domestic rubber factories and cosmetics factories. Recently, a major company in Hamburg, Germany, recognizing the factory's superior products, specifically ordered a large quantity of calcium carbonate from the factory for shipment to Germany for distribution. This is truly a pioneering achievement for domestic raw materials being sold overseas. It is reported that the factory plans to greatly expand its product range this year, including more than ten types such as oxalic acid, sodium sulfate, potassium carbonate, liver of sulfur, descaling powder, silver polishing powder, yellow and white essence, and dextrin. All are important raw materials for the chemical industry. Its various medicinal products are especially welcomed by major pharmacies, which are placing orders in a rush, creating a situation where the factory is overwhelmed with demand.</p>

<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<p>Water Cutoff in Huakang Lane Causes Dispute</p>
<p>In Huakang Lane, Huakang Road, Zhabei, there are dozens of bungalows owned by Tan Fuji, located at No. 4 Hanzhong Road. The monthly rent for each room is seven dollars and twenty cents, and the landlord provides tap water. Recently, for unknown reasons, a disagreement suddenly arose between the landlord and tenants. According to the tenants, the issue is related to house repairs. The houses were built in 1924, and all the tenants are long-time residents. Recently, some tenants requested the landlord to make repairs, but the landlord refused. The tenants then repaired the houses themselves and deducted the cost from the rent, which the landlord rejected, leading to the dispute. Yesterday, the tap water was cut off, causing panic among the tenants. They gathered to discuss the matter, and the sub-landlords Ji Ruyou, Li Rumao, Jiang Yuxin, Gui Buwang, Lü Zhaolong, Zhang Fengqi, Cheng Wanrong, Ma Jialian, Zhao Yuanji, Zhou Huaigen, and others decided to file a petition with the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, requesting assistance.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Storing Accumulated Grain in Warehouses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, for the purpose of accumulating grain in the county, previously purchased land in the Second District to build warehouses, which have now been completed. All two thousand piculs of accumulated grain, previously handled by the Shanghai Soy and Rice Industry Association, have now been completely transported into the warehouses for storage. However, the provincial authorities previously instructed that the county's accumulated grain must be at least five thousand piculs. Seeing that the weather is dry and a famine has already formed, Magistrate Pan considers the accumulation of grain for disaster preparedness to be important. He is now finding ways to raise funds for further purchases. It is also reported that Shanghai County originally had assets, but with the division of the city and county, the county should receive 37%. The county government has sent a letter to the City and County Original Assets Management Committee to withdraw these funds for deposit in the treasury, in accordance with provincial orders.</p>

<h3>Public Bus</h3>
<p>Case of Liu Ansheng Crushed to Death</p>
<p>Changzhou Association Sends Letter Requesting Negotiation</p>
<p>The Changzhou Shanghai Association sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Committee and the Public Works Department regarding the tragic death of Liu Ansheng in a public bus accident, stating, "Respectfully, regarding the case of Mr. Tao Anren being injured by a public bus on August 7th, your committee's letter to the Public Works Department was heartfelt and deeply admired. It cited the past mistakes of the Public Works Department in protecting the British Public Bus Company, listing them one by one, and requesting measures to ensure the safety of citizens in the future, which is an essential proposal and a unanimous demand of the taxpayers. Unexpectedly, before the ink on your committee's letter to the Public Works Department was dry, Mr. Liu Ansheng, a member of our association from Changzhou, was tragically killed. According to a report from member Xie Ruichang, Liu Ansheng was from Changzhou, 21 years old, and worked at the Anglo-American Pharmacy on Shandong Road in the Public Concession. On August 7th at 10 PM, he was riding a bicycle, traveling south to north on Henan Road, in front of the Hongsheng South Goods Store and the Xiliangji Pharmacy. Public bus license number 15014, car number 253, traveling north to south, was speeding and recklessly driving, suddenly and unexpectedly, colliding head-on, causing Liu Ansheng to be unable to avoid it. The bicycle he was riding was caught in the front wheel of the public bus and dragged for more than ten feet. The wheel crushed Liu Ansheng's head, and his breastbone was shattered. He died from his injuries, and the bicycle was completely destroyed. Half an hour later, I learned of this and went to investigate. According to eyewitnesses as mentioned above, Liu Ansheng was sent to Renji Hospital, where he died. The police immediately sent him to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. I went to inquire, and the police instructed me to go the next day (August 8th). The next morning, I went with Liu Linsheng, the cousin of the deceased. At 10 AM, the examiner inquired, first the police and patrolmen stated that the public bus route was correct and that the deceased was careless. Then, the driver involved in the accident was asked, and he refused to admit that he had taken the wrong route. The patrolmen were not eyewitnesses at the time of the accident, how could they know whether the route was wrong? Later, Liu Linsheng, the cousin of the deceased, was asked, he was a worker, and he could not help but cry during the answer. The examiner asked if there were any witnesses. He replied that there was a relative, Xie Ruichang, who had gone to the scene half an hour after the accident to inquire. According to eyewitnesses at the time, the public bus was traveling too fast, had gone outside the prescribed route, and did not honk the horn to warn people to avoid it, causing serious injuries and death. Unexpectedly, the examiner did not wait for Liu Linsheng to finish his statement and immediately forbade him from speaking, announcing that the driver involved in the accident would be released and not sent to court for investigation or compensation. This situation clearly shows that the concession authorities were protecting the British Public Bus Company, and the deceased died with a grievance that could not be cleared. Knowing that I am weak, I can only ask the association to help redress the grievance so that the driver can be warned and will not become more negligent, which will encourage the evil consequences of disregarding human life and ensure the safety of citizens in the future, etc. Based on this, after a detailed investigation by our association, regarding the case of Liu Ansheng, although the driver of public bus number 253 on Route 5 did not commit the crime of intentional homicide, at the time, he was speeding recklessly, taking the wrong route, driving too fast, and did not honk the horn to warn people to avoid it, which was negligence causing death, and he violated Article 291, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, which states that a person engaged in business who causes death due to negligence in business is undoubtedly guilty. The concession authorities, because the Public Bus Company is a British company, protected it, and released the driver involved in the accident without sending him to court to be punished as he should have been, which is illegal. The Public Works Department should uphold the spirit of impartiality and selflessness and send the driver involved in the accident to court for punishment, otherwise, it would violate the wishes of all taxpayers and encourage the driver's negligence and disregard for human life, and the Public Works Department would be an indirect accomplice to murder. Your committee is the mouthpiece of the taxpayers and the protector of the rights of citizens, so we request that you negotiate with the Public Works Department to achieve the purpose of punishing the crime in the Liu Ansheng case. Furthermore, your committee's contribution to the Public Works Department, ordering the Public Bus Company to install protective iron bars on public buses, has not yet been adopted by the Public Works Department, which is incomprehensible. This simple measure cannot be accepted by the taxpayers, which is absurd. Furthermore, our association has something else to say. The speed of public buses should also have a corresponding limit, otherwise, it would be detrimental to the safety of citizens, which is obvious. For public bus drivers who cause incidents in the future, they should be sent to court for punishment, and the opinions of citizens should be humbly accepted, and there should be no unnecessary protection so that the safety of citizens can be guaranteed and avoid unexpected disputes. We hope that your committee will forward this, and we will be grateful. (Note: The Taxpayers' Association has sent a letter to the Public Works Department for investigation.)</p>
<h3>Tragic Fire at the Republic Road Intersection</h3>
<p>Another Body Found Yesterday</p>
<p>The Huili Clock Shop at the intersection of Republic Road in Zhabei recently had a fire, resulting in the tragic deaths of five people and the injury of one person, as reported in various newspapers. At the time, four bodies were recovered, which were examined by Prosecutor Lei of the Shanghai District Court. There was still one body missing because the arsonist was at large and his whereabouts were unknown. The shop had fire insurance of 13,000 taels, guaranteed by four insurance companies. It was necessary to wait for all four guarantee companies to arrive before the search could be carried out. It was not until yesterday afternoon at 3 PM that the burnt body of Weng Cuiyu was found by people sent by the insurance companies. It was already charred. Due to the hot weather in recent days, the body had decomposed and a stench was spreading. After being retrieved, it was placed at the front door of the shop. Passersby all avoided it. Landlord Lu Abao reported to the Shanghai District Court yesterday, but the prosecutor was out on official business, so he will have to report to the court again this morning to request an examination.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Construction of Xinhua Village</h3>
<p>Xinhua Village, built by Xinhua Bank on West Tiyuhui Road, has sold two-thirds of its properties in less than two weeks since it was presented to the public, demonstrating the bank's excellent management and the superior location, which has won the trust of the public. It is recently heard that because houses are being built in the summer, the cement sets faster, and the project is easier to solidify, which is better than other times, so they are not afraid of the summer heat, and work is supervised day and night in this climate of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The project is progressing rapidly, and the materials used are especially excellent. It is estimated that there are four types of houses that are about to be completed, and there are three types of houses under construction: A, C, and special. There are fourteen houses that are in the process of applying for permits and being built. The shops, vegetable markets, etc. managed by the bank have been completed and are being arranged and decorated to facilitate the purchase of residents. The affiliated primary school building is also being planned and built. Overall, the current situation of Xinhua Village can be said to be not far from the completion of the entire new village plan. As for the addition of police posts and the relocation of bus stops, it is reported that active negotiations are underway. The bank has consistently worked hard on the construction of the new village and continued to progress until it is completed, and its service spirit is admirable. On Sunday of last week, there were more than 30 people who went to visit and negotiate about the remaining one-third of the land, which shows the public's concern and interest in Xinhua Village.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Deflation Riot</h3>
<p>Mastermind Defendant Interrogated Yesterday</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 30th of This Month</p>
<p>The case of the rickshaw deflation riot mastermind defendant, prosecuted by the police, was heard again yesterday afternoon at 2 PM in the first criminal court by Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court. First, the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that he was prepared to present the so-called important witness from last time and requested that the public be prohibited from attending. The court granted the request, and after the audience left, the court began questioning the witness (whose name and testimony are not disclosed due to the police's request, fearing accidents), which lasted for more than half an hour. Then, the defendants were questioned. According to the defendants Zheng Fazhu, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, and He Wushan, the purpose of the petition was because they saw reports that the chairman of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, Massey, was about to resign, and that the Rickshaw Affairs Committee had accepted the rickshaw owners' eight conditions, so they petitioned to retain Massey and not change the new regulations. Lawyer Ru then stated that it had been found that the defendants Zhu Fengxiang and He Wushan had not pulled rickshaws for six or seven years, so it was inappropriate for them to represent rickshaw pullers. Then, Chinese Detectives Nos. 94 and 162 presented evidence to investigate the circumstances of Zhu and He not being rickshaw pullers, but Zhu claimed that he was indeed a rickshaw puller, and the numbers of the rickshaws he pulled were 8808 and 8813, and the owner was Yin Zhiling. He Wushan claimed that he had switched to selling vegetables for a period of time but resumed his rickshaw pulling life after the situation stabilized, and the owner was someone on Tiantong Road. Lawyer Ru for the police then stated that the defendant Zheng Fazhu had collected a so-called handling fee of 120 yuan on behalf of the new rickshaw owners Shi Haiyuan and Wang Zaocheng when collecting new licenses from the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, so he was additionally prosecuted for fraud and obtaining property under Article 363 of the Criminal Law. The court then summoned Shi and Wang to the court. The testimony of the two was roughly the same as the points mentioned by Lawyer Ru in yesterday's newspaper. (Omitted) At that time, because the defendant Zheng Fazhu denied that Shi and Wang had been to his house, the court inquired about the location of Zheng's residence, which took a long time and caused many disputes. However, Wang Zaocheng heavily attacked Zhu Maocheng, a member of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, during his testimony, saying that the 120 yuan handling fee was actually obtained by Zhu and that Zheng was just Zhu's puppet. However, Zheng completely denied it. The lawyers on both sides argued fiercely over issues such as the time of payment. The questioning of the witnesses ended at 5 PM. Chen Tingrui, the lawyer representing the Rickshaw Owners Association, then stated that the total amount of civil losses was 37,154 yuan, including 990 damaged vehicles. There was a detailed list and requested that the sentence be pronounced at the same time as the conviction. If the court considered the calculation to be complicated, it requested that it be transferred to the civil court for trial. The court, seeing that the facts were clear, ordered the debate to begin. Lawyer Ru for the police and the lawyers Wu Linkun, Yao Yongli, Fu Ganghou, Yu Chengxiu, and Zhang Yifan for the defendants Zheng Fazhu, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, He Wushan, and Zhu Shuqiao debated each other until 7 PM before the debate was concluded. Judge Zhan then announced that the verdict would be announced at 9 AM on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's City God Procession</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the traditional Ghost Festival. The City God of this county, along with his four attendant deities, paraded to distribute alms to the lonely spirits who lacked offerings. In the morning, all the heads of the various associations gathered. At noon, the procession set out, circling through the inner and outer city. Later, they reached the altar outside Xiaoximen to distribute alms and burn a large quantity of silver ingots and silk. After a short rest, at 6:30 PM, the "Night Gathering" (俗稱夜會) set off from the altar, again circling through various parts of the southern city, turning into Dadongmen and the northern half of the city before returning to the temple. The entire route was managed and kept in order by the heads of the various associations, and the order was quite good.</p>
<h3>Route Petain</h3>
<p>A Large-Scale Red Pill Manufacturing Operation Busted</p>
<p>The Mastermind is at Large, Only Workers and a Driver Arrested</p>
<p>Red Pills and Machinery Seized Valued at Tens of Thousands of Dollars</p>
<p>Jin Jiulin, the Superintendent of the Special Unit of the French Concession Police, received a tip from an informant a few days ago that a large red pill manufacturing operation had been set up on the third floor of number 310 Route Petain. It was said that they were manufacturing pills all night long to avoid the attention of neighbors. Based on the report, Superintendent Jin, along with Detective Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, Deputy Detective Zhou Bingcheng, Detective Liu Dianlong, Bu Zhenglong, and others, secretly went to the address to search it at 1:45 AM yesterday. Arriving at the location, they saw bright lights on the third floor. When they knocked on the door and entered, the workers upstairs had already noticed and quickly turned off the lights and pretended to be asleep. The detectives groped their way up to the third floor in the dark, turned on the lights, and found a large-scale operation. However, no one was there. The pill-making tools were in disarray, indicating that the workers had hidden themselves after hearing the noise. They searched the servants' quarters and found people sleeping, with the fire in the stove under the pill-drying box still burning brightly. They immediately arrested the manufacturing workers on the bed: Guan Xiaocai (43 years old, from Ningbo), Li Shifan (22 years old, from Guangdong), Chen Xiaokang (14 years old, from Haimen), Chen Xiaosheng (13 years old, from Haimen, Chen Xiaokang's younger brother), and the driver Zhang Xiaolin (22 years old, from Jiangbei). They then began the search and seized 130 bags of already made red pills, weighing 78 pounds, and one large package weighing 41 pounds, totaling 119 pounds in three large flour sacks and one large paper package, containing a total of 198,200 pills. They also seized three large drying ovens for manufacturing, three sets of pill-making boards, one rolling stick, four pounds of raw materials, fourteen pounds of white powder, four boxes of red dye, two table boards, one vat, two basins, three copper brushes, four long orange sticks, two pairs of pliers, one bundle of hemp rope, six pieces of plywood, four white porcelain basins, one iron box, one leather box, one glass funnel, seven sieves, one case of advertising paper (about hundreds of sheets), 250 red pill paper covers, ten sticks of sealing wax, one large balance scale, three large steelyards, six small steelyards, one stamp, and five knives. The value of all these items was estimated to be tens of thousands of dollars. They were loaded onto two trucks and taken to the police station. However, the mastermind boss was at large and had not been caught. Yesterday afternoon, the police station sent Guan and the other four to the Second Special District District Court. Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, the police station's lawyer, presented the details of the raid and the seizure of the items, as well as the arrest of the five defendants. He stated that the police station needed ten days to investigate further and arrest the mastermind boss, as they had not yet had time to conduct a thorough investigation or list a detailed inventory of the seized items. Guan Xiaocai confessed that he was an accomplice and that the boss of the illicit red pill manufacturing operation was Zhang Xiaoheng, who had fled upon seeing them being arrested. Li and the two Chen children also admitted to being accomplices in the manufacturing. Zhang Xiaolin confessed to being a driver. The court reviewed the confessions and adjourned the hearing to September 3rd. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Record of the Half-Yearly Meeting of the Child Welfare Association</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Reports on Past Work and Future Hopes</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan Delivers a Speech Hoping for the Popularization of Child Welfare Work Nationwide</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association held its half-yearly meeting for this year yesterday at 5:00 PM in the auditorium on the fifth floor of the National Christian Young Men's Association on Museum Road. President Kong Xiangxi reported on past work and future development plans. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Meeting Order) The order of the meeting was: (1) Chairman of the meeting: Vice President Luo Yunyan, (2) Opening remarks by President Kong, (3) Financial report by accountant Lin Kanghou, (4) Work report by General Secretary Xu Jianping, (5) Speech by Pan Gongzhan, (6) Temporary proposals from members, (7) Guidance from representatives of party and government organizations, (8) Refreshments, (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>(Representatives Present) Representatives present included President Kong Xiangxi (represented by Luo Yunyan), Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, President of Shanghai University Liu Zhanen, General Secretary of the World's Chinese Student Association Zhu Shaoping, Wu Zhijian and Gao Mingqiang of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association Lin Kanghou, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau Li Tingan, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau Wen Hongen, and over two hundred others.</p>
<p>(President Kong's Speech) After the meeting began, President Kong Xiangxi (represented by Luo) delivered a speech, saying, "Gentlemen, today our association is holding its sixth annual half-yearly meeting. So many comrades and guests have come to participate, which shows the interest and enthusiasm of all of you for child welfare work. This truly makes me feel very happy and fills me with infinite hope for the future of child welfare work and the Child Welfare Association. In the first half of this year, we have already established child welfare branches in Beiping and Luanxian. Starting in the second half of this year, we will add another branch, which is the Nanjing Child Welfare Association. Now, people in Shanghai, as well as people all over the country, are showing great interest and enthusiasm for child welfare work. Just based on this, we can confidently believe that the success of China's child welfare work is absolutely not a problem, it is only a matter of time. Today, we are holding this half-yearly meeting here to conduct a thorough review of the past and to make a far-reaching vision for the future. We must base ourselves on the existing foundation of the past and attempt to achieve greater development and greater success in the future. Perhaps we have inevitably had many mistakes and failures in the past, but we can use the experiences of past mistakes and failures to correct our own observations, to supplement our own plans, and to strengthen our own efforts, step by step towards the road to success. I think you all still remember that when we held the fifth annual meeting in January of this year, we passed a so-called 'Five-Year Work Plan of the Chinese Child Welfare Association' (with a total of sixty points), which aroused considerable attention and considerable praise from the general public. However, a plan written on paper is certainly not enough, we should work hard to gradually realize it. Therefore, after the closing of the annual meeting, we considered the limited capacity of our association and the urgent needs of society and formulated our first year of implementation, including the following aspects: In terms of general affairs, (1) convene a national conference of child welfare leaders, (2) establish child welfare branches in various places, (3) expand the Children's Day commemoration movement, (4) provide materials needed for the Children's Year, (5) strengthen domestic and foreign liaison and publicity, (6) strengthen the cooperation and collaboration of related groups, (7) raise funds, and (8) request the allocation of base to protect the base. In terms of protection, (1) promote children's laws, (2) promote children's courts, (3) conduct district surveys of child labor, (4) stop the sale of children, (5) report child abuse, and (6) rescue special children. In terms of relief, (1) establish reformatories to help homeless children, (2) establish complaints offices to rescue forced prostitutes, (3) expand the Tangshan Road Child Welfare Training Home, (4) expand the Yangshupu Child Welfare Nursery, (5) plan to establish Child Welfare Nurseries in Pudong or Zhabei. In terms of health, (1) establish the Zhabei Child Welfare Experimental Zone, first setting up a Child Welfare Clinic, (2) establish the Jiangwan Child Welfare Tuberculosis Sanatorium, (3) pilot the Nanjing Children's Health Park, (4) hold children's health movements, and (5) publish various books on pregnancy, infant care, and other health topics. In terms of education, (1) hold child welfare lectures and broadcasts, (2) promote the Modern Parents Monthly, (3) promote children's savings, (4) hold exhibitions of children's toys and reading materials, (5) add to the Parents Education Series, and (6) publish new era parents and children education puzzles. In total, there are thirty tasks to be carried out in this year, the 23rd year of the Republic of China. From January of this year to now, almost seven months have passed. In these seven months, we have already carried out some of the tasks, some are in progress, and some are to be carried out in the second half of the year. At the time of holding this half-yearly meeting today, we are willing to report our work situation to the society most faithfully and ask for social criticism and guidance. The achievements of the association's work in the past half-year will be reported by the General Secretary, so I don’t need to say more about this. What I want to say now is that I hope that you will truly and without any politeness examine our work and add a review. There was a merchant who often said to his customers, 'If you are not satisfied with our service, please honestly and frankly tell us so that we can correct it. If you are satisfied with our service, please do your duty to promote it to your friends so that we can expand the scope of our service in the future.' Today I can say the same thing: 'If you are not satisfied with the work of the Child Welfare Association, please honestly and frankly tell us so that we can correct it. If you are satisfied with our work, please do your duty to promote it to your friends so that we can expand the scope of our work in the future.' In the past, the association has been able to achieve a little success entirely because of the constant supervision and support of sympathetic people in society. As the Chairman of the Association, I should represent the Association and express my sincere thanks to all sympathetic people. From now on, the association's responsibilities will be heavier and the association's work will be more, so our needs for society will certainly be more urgent than in the past. Therefore, while thanking you on the one hand, on the other hand, I have to represent the association and ask you to give us more severe supervision and more extensive support. Now, the most noticeable country in the world is Soviet Russia. In the past, no country in the world looked up to Soviet Russia, and they all thought that Soviet Russia was a culturally backward country. However, since the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, all countries in the world have looked at it with new eyes, acknowledging that Soviet Russia is also a civilized country and also a powerful country. Speaking of our China, if we stand from the standpoint of child welfare, we are indeed inferior to others in every way. Usually, when foreigners talk about China, they always think that China is a culturally backward country, which does not pay attention to all aspects, especially the happiness and education of children, and has never known how to pay attention to it. I hope, and firmly believe, that if the Five-Year Plan of the Chinese Child Welfare Association can be realized item by item, then the happiness and education of Chinese children will be able to develop greatly, and China's international cultural status will certainly be able to improve, and we will no longer hear people say that our China is a culturally backward country. All of this depends on our efforts and our hard work. I am willing to encourage everyone together."</p>
<p>(Work Report) Then, General Secretary Xu Jianping reported on the general situation of the work, saying, (A) General Affairs Group (1) Hold fundraising campaigns, (2) Hold child welfare dance parties and theater parties, (3) Prepare for the Nanjing Child Welfare Association, (4) Promote Children's Year, (5) Promote Children's Day, (6) Convene a national conference of child welfare leaders, (7) Take over the Zhabei Civilian Training Home, (B) Protection Group, (1) Handle children's cases, (2) Request the right of representation for child welfare organizations, (C) Relief Group, (1) Child Welfare Training Home, (2) Child Welfare Nursery, (3) Subsidize child welfare organizations, (D) Health Group, (1) Establish a Child Welfare Clinic, (2) Prepare to build a Child Welfare Sanatorium, (E) Education Group, (1) Publish the Modern Parents Monthly, (2) Publish Parents Education Posters, (3) Publish Parents Education (4) Ask the Ministry of Education to issue a general order requiring secondary and higher schools to pay attention to parents education, (5) Hold child welfare broadcasts and lectures. Then, Lin Kanghou reported on the economic situation.</p>
<p>(Director Pan's Speech) After the report, Director Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Education Bureau gave a speech, saying that the organization of the Child Welfare Association dates back to the 17th year of the Republic of China. It has been six or seven years since then. Thanks to the enthusiastic and responsible guidance of the members, a foundation has been laid so far. All the constructions for the preservation and care of children have been roughly scaled, and the results are remarkable. According to its purpose, it is originally the meaning of the ancient sages of our country to educate the young and care for the elderly, such as Mencius said, "Respect the elderly in my family, and extend it to the elderly in other families; love the young in my family, and extend it to the young in other families." It is nothing more than feeling that the strength of the country and the peace of society all depend on the people to protect the orphans and old and young people in the society. This kind of cause should have been promoted by the country. Now, in the midst of internal and external troubles, the people spontaneously organize groups to assist the government in adopting and caring for children who have lost their parents. It is indeed a rare move. In the future, I hope that comrades who are enthusiastic about child welfare in China and abroad will make further efforts to promote it so that its scope will be extended to the whole country, then the orphans and weak women of the whole country will be very fortunate. Then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Yifei Case Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hong Chengde and His Concubine Still Did Not Appear</p>
<p>Yifei's Mother Wept Bitterly in Court</p>
<p>The famous courtesan Yifei, originally named Chen Zhujun, and Yang Qiusun's grandson Binghu, a compradore of Puyi Real Estate Company, died together in the bathroom of Hong Chengde's residence in the Sun Apartments. Now Chen's mother, Chen Wangshi, claims that her daughter was killed by Xie Peide, the sales director of Shanghai Cement Company, Hong Chengde, and Hong's concubine. She has hired lawyer Ye Fikang to file a private prosecution against Xie and others, requesting that they be punished according to law and that Xie be ordered to return her daughter's jewelry. The First Special District District Court has already conducted a preliminary hearing. Due to the need to investigate witnesses, the hearing was postponed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the court again to continue the hearing. The defendant Hong Chengde and his beloved concubine still did not appear, and the essential witness Yang Qiusun also failed to appear. According to the plaintiff Chen Wangshi, she heard that Hong's wife and concubine (are now in Shanghai). She requested that an arrest warrant be issued. She claimed, "My daughter was indeed beaten to death by the defendants. If it was suicide, it would be difficult to shoot herself twice. Now, two people were beaten to death, not two dogs. Moreover, I only have this one daughter. Who will I rely on from now on? I beg the old master to redress my grievance, otherwise, my grievance will never be cleared. My daughter came to 2 Baker Road on April 26 and told me that Xie would put her to death. If she died unfortunately, I had to redress her grievance. At that time, I did not believe it and comforted her. Unexpectedly, my daughter was taken away that day after returning home. If my daughter wanted to commit suicide, why would she commit suicide in the Sun Apartments?" She cried bitterly as she spoke, and the audience (were mostly moved to tears). At this time, the plaintiff's lawyer expressed dissatisfaction with the investigation report made by West Detective Hua Desheng of the Jing'an Temple Police Station regarding the case. He said that the case occurred on April 28, but the report was made on the 17th of this month, and its content was quite similar to Xie's defense. For example, the testimony of Hua Detective He Yunpu, which was unfavorable to Xie, and the fact that Chen Zhujun's jewelry was taken away by Xie after her death, were generally omitted, which could not satisfy the plaintiff. The court then summoned West Detective Hua Desheng for questioning. The detective first stated the situation of investigating the bodies in Hong's bathroom with Hua Detective after the incident. He then said that he saw a jewelry box on the table in the living room, and the detective (checked the situation of the items) only claimed that he asked the people present who owned the jewelry, and Hong Chengde replied that it was his. Since the box was not related to the incident, he did not take it to the police station. As for the details provided by He Yunpu in the previous court hearing, I only heard about them for the first time that day because He did not report the situation to me as he said. The court then summoned He Yunpu for questioning. According to his testimony, after I finished investigating the case that day and returned to the police station, I reported the situation to Detective Hua. As for the jewelry, after I checked it that day, I did not have time to ask about it because I had to go to the hospital to transport the two bodies to the autopsy site. It was not until the autopsy the next day that I asked Hong Chengde about the whereabouts of the jewelry, and Hong said that Xie Peide had taken it away. West Detective Hua Desheng continued to state that today's (case report) was copied from the records and investigation case books in the police station, and the books were recorded after the investigation at that time. At this time, the witness Xu Hongjun slowly came from outside. Xu worked as a gatekeeper at the Sun Apartments. The court stated that according to He Yunpu's previous testimony, he had asked Xu about it on the day of the incident. Xu told him that when Chen Zhujun arrived at the Sun Apartments by car on April 26, there were five or six men and women in the car. Later, Chen tried to escape, but was stopped by Hong's maid, and someone was also watching her in the room. Therefore, he immediately ordered Xu to enter the witness stand and asked whether the above situation was true. However, Xu's answer was rather ambiguous. The court questioned him again and then said that he also heard it from passers-by and Hong's maid when they were chatting. The court then ordered his concubine to appear in court for questioning at the next hearing, and the plaintiff then requested that the essential witness Yang Qiusun must also appear in court and must not evade again. Judge Wu then adjourned the hearing for a continued hearing.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhaocheng, Involved in the Liu Chongwu Case, is Sentenced</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year and Six Months in Prison</p>
<p>Maotai Yang Goods Store at 310 Xinzha Road and Yuheng Yang Goods Store at 339 Hankou Road were warned by the Iron-Blooded Elimination of Traitors Group for selling inferior goods between November 18th and 24th of last year. Because they ignored the warnings, the manager Wang Zhentao and his partner Wang Yirong were shot with a handgun, resulting in fatal injuries. Later, the police station arrested the criminals Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songtao, Tian Shuiyang, and others and sent them to the First Special District Court. As a result, Cao was sentenced to twelve years in prison, Liu to seven years, and Pan and Tian were each sentenced to six years. They confessed that the handguns and bombs belonged to Wang Zhaocheng, a member and adjutant of the Shanghai Civilian Righteous Army Expedition to the Northeast, who was from Haining. On June 15th of this year, Hua Detectives Ma Bingzhang and Wang Guangtian of the Jiaxing Road Police Station arrested him and sent him to the First Criminal Court. After the interrogation was over, he waited for the sentence. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the trial and sentenced Wang Zhaocheng to one year and six months in prison for joint murder. The number of days of detention before the trial was determined to be two days for one day of imprisonment. The other parts were not guilty. The defendant's agent lawyer declared an appeal, and the court approved it.</p>
<h3>Three Suicide Attempts</h3>
<p>Fortunately, All Survived</p>
<p>Yu Shengfa Yu Shengfa, a native of Ningbo, is 22 years old and works at Zhongji Silk Store at 10 Baoan Lane, Tianjin Road. Yesterday, he was fired by the manager of the store due to an accident. After Yu heard the announcement of his dismissal, he felt as if struck by lightning and was in despair. At around 7:30 PM, he secretly swallowed raw opium in an attempt to commit suicide. After being discovered, the police station was notified and the central ambulance was dispatched to the scene, and he was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Gu Zhu Shi Gu Zhu Shi, a local young woman, is 27 years old and rents a residence at 127 Gaochang Temple, Nanshi. Her husband, Gu Yinsheng, is a customs broker. Recently, due to poor business, he has been heavily in debt, and creditors often come to the door to collect debts. As a result, there are frequent quarrels between the couple. Yesterday morning, another creditor came to demand payment. Unable to avoid it, she decided to commit suicide and secretly swallowed a gold ring. Later, she was discovered and taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Qin Zhou Shi Qin Zhou Shi, a woman from Dantu, is 25 years old and lives at 89 Guangqi Road, Nanshi. Her husband's name is Jia Hui, and he works as a salesman in a soap factory. He likes to indulge in pleasure and often does not return home for several days, neglecting all the expenses of the family. Yesterday morning, Zhou tried to ask her husband for household expenses, but he beat her instead. Afterwards, she was so angry that she secretly swallowed opium and attempted suicide. Later, neighbors called the police, and she was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Deep Affection of Japanese Women</h3>
<p>Preferring to Die with Their Chinese Husbands</p>
<p>Ito Tetsuko, Wife of Pan Xiangxi</p>
<p>Yonezawa Yukiko, Wife of Zhang Yaosheng</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, Pan Xiangxi from Wenzhou, along with his wife Ito Tetsuko (from Hanaoka Town, Akita County, Akita Prefecture, Japan) and their two children, returned to China from Japan. They were stopped by the police of the Japanese Consulate at the wharf and were not allowed to go to Wenzhou. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. After they were placed under the surveillance of the Japanese police at the Hinode Ryokan in Yifeng Lane, Kunshan Road, they were originally ordered to go to the Consulate General the next day to listen to the order. Unexpectedly, at 10:30 PM on the 22nd, they secretly left the hotel. At 11:20 PM, the hotel telegraphed the police station of the Consulate General. The police station was very unhappy that the Japanese woman was determined to go with her husband. According to the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, Zhang Yaosheng, a worker at the Senju Standard Shoe Store in Adachi Ward, Tokyo, was forced to return to China on the 20th due to labor permit regulations. Since Zhang's wife, Yonezawa Yukiko (a Japanese woman), married Zhang, their love has been deep and unwavering. Yukiko's mother (Zhang's Japanese mother-in-law, 61 years old) also treats Zhang very kindly, regardless of national boundaries. This time, when she heard that the Japanese government had deported Zhang, she suddenly came to Tokyo with her daughter from Osaka, saying that Yukiko had already given birth to two children, "Even if I want to put her to death, I don't want to live apart from Zhang. No matter what, I must go to China with Zhang." Now Yukiko and others have set off to Dalian to cross over to China.</p>
<h3>After Xu Qingyun's Death</h3>
<p>Eldest Daughter Sues to Divide Inheritance</p>
<p>Mediation Fails</p>
<p>The late Xu Qingyun, also known as A Mao, a local tycoon in foreign goods in the French Concession, owned several stores solely and jointly during his lifetime. He resided at 58 Avenue Hoche in the French Concession, a self-owned property. He first married a Ms. Chen, with whom he had a daughter named Xu Daxin, now thirty-three years old and still unmarried. Twenty years ago, Xu also took another Ms. Chen as a concubine. After they moved in together, she bore him a son and two daughters. The love between husband and concubine was deep, and he treated his first wife, Ms. Chen, like worn-out shoes, not even caring about her livelihood. Therefore, three years ago, Xu's wife, Ms. Chen, hired lawyer Li Xinyang to sue Xu at the French Concession Court. The result was that both parties settled the case with 25,000 yuan. In the years of 1931 and 1933, Xu Qingyun and his first wife passed away one after another. All the inheritance, estimated to be over a million gold, was controlled by Xu's concubine, Ms. Chen. Recently, Xu's eldest daughter, Xu Daxin, requested to divide her late father's inheritance, but her stepmother, Ms. Chen, ignored her. Therefore, Xu Daxin hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao as her agent and filed a petition with the mediation court of the Second Special District Court, requesting mediation for the division of the inheritance. The court, based on the petition, summoned both parties yesterday. Judge Tu Shenjie opened the court for mediation. The petitioner's agent, lawyer Zhang Shizhao, was represented by Peng Jianxun. The opposing party, Xu Chen, hired lawyer Xue Dubi, who was represented by lawyer Cao Shoulin. First, the petitioner's lawyer Peng stated that the late Xu Qingyun had a total inheritance of over a million, now estimated at 800,000. The petitioner should receive one-fourth, totaling 200,000 yuan. He requested the court to instruct the opposing party to distribute the inheritance accordingly. The opposing party's agent, lawyer Cao, stated that the petitioner's mother had previously been involved in a lawsuit with Xu Qingyun. Both parties reached a settlement through a mediator, and a written agreement was made as proof. Since there was already a settlement, how could there be another request? He urged both parties to settle the matter amicably. The opposing party's lawyer also stated that the opposing party was willing to settle with a thousand yuan. The petitioner's agent lawyer stated that the amount of the petitioner's claim was very large, and the amount offered by the opposing party was vastly different, making it difficult to reach a settlement. Judge Tu, seeing that mediation was unsuccessful, declared the mediation to be unsuccessful and ordered that a separate lawsuit be filed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Instructing the Release of Shaoxing Wine with Transportation Permits</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 23rd of this month, we received a letter from the Shaoxing Wine Trade Association, stating that a member of the association, the Nanchezhan Xingongji Shaoxing Wine Transportation Company, reported that the company had 100 jars of Lao Dongming sample wine, declared by Xieheyong to be shipped to Dalian, and 200 jars of Bei Dongming Jingda Shaoxing wine, declared by Shenyu to be shipped to Beiping. On the morning of the 18th of this month at 9:00 AM, they first used three flatbed cars to transport 68 jars of Jingda wine and 100 jars of sample wine for transfer, with staff from both Xieheyong and Shenyu customs brokers carrying transit customs documents and origin-based provincial transportation permits accompanying the cars. Unexpectedly, when the wine cars reached Hujunying Road, inspector Wang Bingxia of the Shanghai Inspection Office and others, believing that they had not affixed Jiangsu Province tax stamps, considered it tax evasion. After being informed that the aforementioned Shaoxing wine was for export, and that the tax stamps had been affixed at the place of origin in Zhejiang Province, and that according to regulations, no additional stamps were required when passing through Jiangsu Province, and presenting the customs documents and transportation permits for verification and detailed explanation, inspector Wang and others disregarded everything, sounded the alarm, and ordered the wine and cars to be sent to the Second District Police Station, and three car drivers were also detained at the same time, resulting in significant business losses for the company. Please investigate and handle the matter,' the letter stated. After discussion at the sixth executive and supervisory emergency meeting of our association, it was determined that since the export procedures for the aforementioned Shaoxing wine had been verified and there were no violations, yet it was forcibly detained, it was clearly infringing on business. It is appropriate to submit a request for a swift telegram instructing its release to alleviate business difficulties, which would be beneficial," the letter stated. Article 14 of the Regulations on Fixed-Amount Tax for Local Wine stipulates that local wine produced in other provinces that passes through this province should, upon entry and exit, present the transportation permit or voucher from the producing province for verification by the local tax collection authority. If the verification is consistent, the tax collection authority should affix its seal, along with the date, and stamp it as verified for entry or exit, and release it immediately without delay or extortion. Therefore, according to regulations, no tax is required when passing through a province. The Shaoxing wine in question came from Zhejiang Province and possessed a transportation permit from the place of origin for provincial departure, as well as transit customs documents, accompanying the cars. According to regulations, there were no violations. Since Jiangsu Province was a transit province, there was legally no reason to pay taxes or affix stamps. The inspection office detained the wine without authorization under the pretext of not affixing Jiangsu Province tax stamps. Is this due to a lack of clear regulations, or is it intentional obstruction? It is appropriate to report the situation and request your ministry to investigate and order the release immediately, for the sake of public convenience. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits the request."</p>
<h3>Dispute over Manure Transportation in the Southern District of Shanghai</h3>
<p>City Farmers' Association Requests Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Southern District Farmers' Association was accused by some manure transportation cart owners of extortion and corruption, a dispute has arisen, attracting social attention. The City Farmers' Association, considering the matter to be related to the livelihoods of farmers and the reputation of the association, has decided to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the truth. The supervisory committee of the City Party Headquarters has reviewed the accounts of the district farmers' association over the years. Hundreds of cart owners, yesterday, jointly submitted a petition to the City Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the City Farmers' Association, the Central Military Police Political Training Department, and other agencies, denying the accusations and presenting the facts of the matter to seek public opinion. The original petition is excerpted below: "Petition regarding the Shanghai Southern District Farmers' Association acting as agent for the collection of sanitation fees, and denying the listed accusations, requesting review. The manure tax in the Shanghai Southern District began in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, even under the despotic rule of the imperial system, farmers repeatedly staged strikes and protests against the manure tax due to their vital interests. Despite being imprisoned, they did not yield and eventually achieved the goal of tax exemption. After the establishment of the Republic of China, some people again proposed the manure tax, but it was not implemented. Later, Yuan Shikai seized power, and harsh taxes were continuously levied. The manure tax, which impoverished the poor farmers, was again contracted to merchants. Over the course of ten years, the tax rate increased repeatedly. Each manure cart paid four yuan per month, one yuan per year for the copper plate fee, and six jiao to one yuan for each festival fee, in addition to other demands. Moreover, due to the contractors selling the manure to other locations, there was often a shortage of fertilizer for agriculture, causing farmers great suffering. Under the oppression of warlords, there was no way to appeal. In 1927, the Party Army conquered Shanghai. Under the guidance of our Party, the farmers in the Shanghai Southern District organized the Farmers' Association to alleviate their suffering. After repeated struggles and hardships, they managed to reduce the tax rate and reached an agreement with the Sanitation Department to have the Farmers' Association act as agent for the sanitation fees for agricultural manure transportation carts, with the principle that farmers transport and use the manure themselves and are not allowed to sell it. After a resolution by our association, in addition to the fixed tax rate of two yuan and one jiao and nine fen per manure cart per month, an additional voluntary donation of eight jiao and one fen was collected, and a fee of two yuan was paid each summer to fund the association's activities, such as running schools, subsidizing self-defense, promoting cooperation, and providing tea and medicine. The Farmers' Association had no funds of its own and relied on this fee due to the frequent addition of matters related to sanitation, increased expenses for work attendance, and staff salaries. This was taken from the public and used for the public, and it was voluntary for the farmers. For several years, although the Farmers' Association has changed several times, the fees have remained the same, because the tax rate is lower than before and the procedures are more convenient, so everyone is happy to comply. Moreover, various taxes have increased in recent years. Even merchants who contract sanitation fees from the Finance Bureau have increased the tax rate annually. Only our manure transportation carts in the Shanghai Southern District, which are about to unite, have not increased taxes and have remained the same for several years. However, this time, a small number of cart owners from other provinces (also members of the Farmers' Association) violated the principle of self-transport and self-use, sold fertilizer, violated the agreement, and conspired to establish a fertilizer sales company, hoping to monopolize the market, enrich themselves, and ignore the agricultural fertilizer in the Shanghai Southern District. The Farmers' Association, because these people were destroying public interests, intended to punish them according to the association's rules. These people, seeing that their plan could not succeed, harbored resentment and initially accused the Farmers' Association of defrauding money in court, but the case was dismissed. Now, they are accusing them in military agencies. On the 19th of this month, the Farmers' Association convened a meeting of manure cart owners to discuss disposal methods, and they led military police to arrest the Farmers' Association staff. The case has now been transferred to the City Executive Committee for processing. Yesterday, we read a news report entitled 'Shanghai Southern District Manure Cart Owners Request Strict Punishment of the Farmers' Association,' which stated that all 204 manure cart owners in the Shanghai Southern District jointly petitioned the Political Training Department of the Central Military Police Regiment, requesting strict punishment because the Farmers' Association was holding the association's affairs, seizing power, and exploiting them. We were shocked to read it. Not only are the accusations completely fabricated, but we farmers have never been listed as accusers. The false accusations should be thoroughly investigated by your association (department) (bureau) to maintain the manure transportation, so that the agitators cannot use their cunning tricks. Otherwise, the right to self-transport and self-use fertilizer, which we have fought for for several years, will be sacrificed by these people, and the past suffering will reappear today. We are terrified at the thought. We farmers cultivate and eat here, and rely on fertilizer as an essential element for agriculture. Several people jointly operate a manure cart and take turns to collect manure. These hundreds of manure carts actually supply fertilizer to thousands of farming households. Now, they are suddenly being destroyed. For the sake of our vital interests, we respectfully present the facts and request a clear understanding. It is also necessary to state the accusations and requests. (1) In the accusation document, it states 'The presenters (102 Shanghai natives and 102 from other provinces) all earn a living by pulling carts and dumping manure in Shanghai.' This clearly indicates that they make a living by selling manure, which has violated the principle of self-transport and self-use. They deliberately included the names of hundreds of us farmers, dragging things out in the hope of overturning the established case and collecting taxes to enrich themselves. Their intentions are obvious. (2) 'For each new cart, the City Finance Bureau instructs the Public Utilities Bureau to issue a white porcelain license plate, charging seven yuan and two jiao, but they demand 25 yuan to 35 yuan for each plate.' We farmers have not been defrauded of this money, and it is clearly fabricated out of thin air. (3) 'Request to make the accounts public.' This has been handled by the City Executive Committee, and whether there are any irregularities will be revealed. (4) 'Return the soft paper licenses for manure carts.' This is stored in the association for proof of membership when receiving licenses. If these people request the return of the soft licenses, it means they are leaving the Farmers' Association and can freely sell manure, achieving their ambitions. (5) 'Request to allow 204 people to withdraw from the Farmers' Association.' We farmers have always regarded the Farmers' Association as a group of farmers. Only through unity can we alleviate suffering. These people are destroying the group and should be expelled from membership to eliminate the harmful elements. In short, we farmers will not allow a minority to destroy the group and vow to fight together with the indomitable spirit of the past few years. Respectfully submitted to the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai City Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Political Training Department of the Second Regiment of the Central Military Police, the Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, and manure cart owners of the Shanghai Southern District Farmers' Association (139 people), represented by Ma Yisheng, Zhang Zhongjie, Cao Jinhua, Zhao Yundi, He Shanxin, Chen Mingzhao, Mao Zixiang, Shen Changgen, Zhu Xinlian, Zhang Linquan, Shen Wensheng, Shen Lanqing, Zhou Qisheng, Yao Jinqing, etc."</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of Zhengda Bank</h3>
<p>Zhengda Bank of this city, due to the small size of the premises on Jiangxi Road, which was insufficient for development, has now selected a new building at 95 Tianjin Road and officially moved into the new premises yesterday (i.e., the 24th). In the early morning, Tianjin Road was bustling with traffic and extremely crowded. The scale of guests was indescribable. Most of the famous figures and tycoons in Shanghai attended, such as Song Hanzhang, Lin Kanghou, Feng Zhongqing, Chen Guangfu, Yu Zuoting, Pei Yunqing, Wang Juru, Xie Taofu, Shi Jiu'ao, Pan Jiufen, Zhang Muhao, Wu Zhihao, Mei Zhezhi, Xu Tingzuo, Jin Runxiang, Zhu Meixian, Ren Shuoxian, etc., no less than a thousand people. The chairman of the bank, Sun Bosheng, and all the directors, Wang Yiting, Wang Yaochen, Wu Hongshi, Ding Fangzhen, Zhu Yanqing, supervisor Peng Xingsheng, Gao Peiliang, general manager Wang Wenzhi, deputy managers Tu Hengli, Chai Zhifang, etc., cordially greeted the guests with tea and refreshments, and prepared exquisite gifts to present to the guests as souvenirs.

He has increased equipment and expanded work over the years, achieving excellent results, which have been trusted and praised by the society and the medical community. This is all due to the director's expertise and his willingness to study carefully and strive for success. It is commendable. It is hereby ordered that the Bureau immediately issue an order of commendation to encourage him. This order."</p>
<h3>Robbery on Xiaoshadu Road</h3>
<p>A certain family at No. 35, Lane 714, Xiaoshadu Road, was suddenly broken into by three bandits at around 2:30 PM yesterday. Two of the bandits were armed with pistols. They held everyone in the house captive and forced them to hand over the box keys. They ransacked the boxes and chests and searched at will, eventually robbing them of more than 170 yuan in cash and escaping. Afterwards, the victim reported to the police station in charge and requested a pursuit.</p>
<h3>Three Fires in One Day</h3>
<p>Weihaiwei Road: At the western end of Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road, there were more than ten old-style bungalows in Youzheng Lane. At 1:20 PM yesterday, Liu Rongcai, a tenant in the loft of Chen Yushan's house at No. 13, was burning paper ingots at home to worship ancestors yesterday as it was the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, which caused a fire. It quickly spread out of control. Although the fire brigade immediately dispatched vehicles to rescue, it was difficult to water due to the narrow lane. As a result, a total of seven rooms at Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 were burned to ashes. The Shixingzhiji silk weaving factory on the opposite side also had one of its rear buildings burned down, but the losses were minimal. When the fire was raging, Zhang Yulin (49 years old), a resident of No. 10, jumped from the loft and injured his waist. He was then taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<p>Daxi Road: At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a fire broke out in a straw shed at No. 311, Daxi Road, Xuhui, due to careless cooking. It quickly spread out of control. The fire brigade was alerted and dispatched vehicles to the scene to put out the fire. Only one straw house was burned down. However, when the fire was raging, a woman escaped from the fire and was severely burned. She was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment by ambulance. It is said that her injuries were serious and her life may be in danger.</p>
<p>North Shaanxi Road: At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the Qingxiangzhai tofu shop at No. 122, North Shaanxi Road. Thick smoke filled the air and the fire was very fierce. The fire brigade was alerted and dispatched vehicles to the scene and made every effort to put out the fire. Only one floor was burned down.</p>
<h3>Dance Girl Chen Bowen Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Severely Poisoned, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Chen Bowen, a Cantonese woman and dancer at the Yixiafei Dance Hall on Avenue Masnan and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, is 30 years old, graceful, and fond of dressing up. She is one of the most beautiful dancers in the hall. Recently, she felt economic pressure and suddenly had suicidal thoughts. At around 10:45 PM last night, she went alone to the Datong Hotel on the fourth floor of Nanjing Road and opened room No. 409, where she ingested a large amount of opium to commit suicide. The waiter discovered her and quickly reported to the front desk, who reported to the Old Gate Police Station and ordered patrolman No. 303 to come. He also summoned the manager of the dance hall and took her to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. However, she was severely poisoned and was already unconscious when she arrived at the hospital. Although the doctor gave her injections and medication, her life was still in danger at midnight.</p>
<h3>Xue Xianggen Sentenced for Arson</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Seven Years in Prison</p>
<p>The Xie Feng Woolen Store at No. 156, Hubei Road, has been open for only a few months and had fire insurance of 10,000 yuan with the Ning Shao Company. Because the business was sluggish and losses were heavy, the store owner, Xue Xianggen from Wuxi, had bad intentions. On the night of the 9th of this month at 12:30 AM, he poured kerosene on the furniture and set it on fire, intending to claim compensation. After the Central Fire Brigade received the report, it immediately dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire. Later, Old Gate Police Station detectives Chong Ruiqing and He Renrui found out the truth and arrested him. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court in accordance with Article 187, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The trial has been concluded. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict: Xue Xianggen was sentenced to seven years in prison for setting fire to a dwelling currently in use.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of Mr. Xiao Chunyuan, who states that he runs the Yongshun Printing Materials Store and has always been law-abiding. Recently, the Dadong Silk Weaving Factory was blockaded by some youths for selling Japanese goods. At that time, the factory instructed an employee, Shen Zutang, to go to Mr. Xiao's house and ask him to mediate. Due to neighborly relations, Mr. Xiao could not refuse and immediately went to mediate, earnestly persuading them. As a result, nothing untoward happened. Unexpectedly, the police have filed a public lawsuit against Mr. Xiao for intimidation and fraud. A hearing was held on the morning of the 18th, and the plaintiff, Lü Ruzhou, testified in court that he only reported the facts of the case and never mentioned Mr. Xiao. Furthermore, Shen Zutang and others testified that they had invited him to mediate. It is clear that he has been unjustly accused. The details in your newspaper report are quite different from the facts. I have been specially commissioned by this lawyer to write to your newspaper, requesting that you publish a correction to avoid misunderstandings by the outside world and to protect his reputation. Respectfully submitted to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Lawyer Zhang Fukang, August 23rd.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having read in the Local News section of your newspaper on the 24th of this month about the shooting of Sun Zhenqing, an employee of Mingde School at the intersection of Xujiahui Xietu Road and Tianyaoqiao Road in the French Concession, we have investigated and found that there is no person named Sun Zhenqing among our faculty and staff. There is only a cook surnamed Sun, but this is a matter of contracting for meals and is a private affair unrelated to our school. We hereby declare this and hope for an immediate correction. Respectfully submitted to the Esteemed Chief Editor, Mingde Elementary School, 24th.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers for Readers</p>
<h3>Re-discussing the Chicken-or-Egg Problem</h3>
<p>——Answering Hu Jie and Others</p>
<p>A few days ago, we published an article on the "chicken or egg" problem, which attracted a lot of attention from readers. However, that article focused on the biological aspects of the explanation, and the content was somewhat too specialized, so some readers could not fully understand it. Now, we will use a more accessible way to explain this issue.</p>
<p>On the surface, this question seems to only concern chickens, but in reality, it is not limited to chickens. There are similar situations and similar questions in everyday life. For example, we go to the store or factory to work in the morning and return home to eat and sleep in the evening. We use our labor to earn a little money each month and bring it home to support our family. At the same time, our family uses the money I provide to prepare the necessary clothing, food, housing, and other things for my life. If my family did not have my support, they could not live. But if I did not have my family to take care of the necessities of life, my life would also be problematic, because I have to spend all day working and really do not have the time to take care of my own life. Therefore, we have to ask: "Am I supporting my family, or is my family supporting me?" Isn't that a bit similar to the question we asked: "Did the chicken come first, or the egg?" Or some people will say: There are many people in society who don't have a home; they live a vagrant life, working during the day, and having no fixed place to live or eat at night. They spend one night here, one night there, one meal here, and one meal there. They don't have a home, but they can still survive, right? Yes, there are such people, but for these people, there are other similar questions that arise. When these people are hungry, they have to use the money they earn from work to buy food at the shop. When they want to sleep, they have to use the money they earn from work to buy a place to sleep at a temporary lodging. They have to rely on the strength of the food vendors and the owners of the lodgings to sustain their lives. At the same time, the food vendors and the owners of the lodgings have to rely on the diners and lodgers to support their own lives. So we have to ask again: Are the diners and lodgers supporting the owners, or are the owners supporting the diners and lodgers? Isn't this the same kind of question? (To be continued)</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Inspector</h3>
<p>Recently Inspects Vocational Education in Hunan, Provides Improvement Suggestions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently sent Inspector Gu Zhaolin to inspect the state of vocational education in Hunan Province. The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry of Education. The key points of the report regarding the urgent need to improve vocational education in Hunan are summarized below:</p>
<h3>(A) General Issues</h3>
<p>(1) The vocational schools established by the province often have overlapping departments. For example, the Provincial Advanced Technical School has a mechanical engineering department, and the Provincial Changsha No. 1 Vocational School, Hengyang No. 3 Vocational School, and Baoqing No. 4 Vocational School also have metalworking departments. Although the names are different, the content is largely the same. The dyeing and weaving and applied chemistry departments also have the same situation. The following measures should be taken to correct this: A. Separate management of departments. This measure involves extracting the part of a department's categories that is suitable for the local situation, increasing the amount of research and learning, and reducing the scope of the original curriculum to achieve specialization in art. For example, in western Hunan, where there is abundant production of oil and leather, the applied chemistry department of Changde No. 2 Vocational School can specialize in oil painting or leather making. In the Baoqing area, there are many fibrous raw materials available for papermaking. The bleached paper researched and improved by Baoqing No. 4 Vocational School is better than local products and can specialize in papermaking. If the above method cannot be applied within a department, and the establishment of the department cannot be changed for the time being, the same departments in two or more schools can be merged into one school to change to a single-department setting. B. Centralized management. If it is possible to thoroughly transform vocational schools throughout the province, it is best to centralize management. Suppose Changsha No. 1 Vocational School runs a metalworking department, then the metalworking departments of Hengyang and Baoqing should be merged into Changsha. If Changde sets up an applied chemistry department for oil painting, leather making, etc., then the two applied chemistry departments of Hengyang and Baoqing should be merged into Changde. If Baoqing specializes in dyeing and weaving, then Changsha, Hengyang, and Changde should be merged into Baoqing (in terms of geography, it would be more convenient for Changde to handle dyeing and weaving and Baoqing to handle applied chemistry). In this way, factory equipment can be easily planned from an overall perspective, and it is easy to allocate teaching talents appropriately. However, there are difficulties in the process of transformation, and careful planning and proper implementation should be made.</p>
<p>(2) The operation of vocational schools in Hunan Province shows that private schools have achieved quite good results. For example, Xiuye Chuyi, Gongyu, and other schools can select one or two subjects in vocational disciplines to refine students' skills, so that they can engage in production after graduation, which is commendable. Provincial schools should also pay attention to this in the future to avoid being superficial.</p>
<p>(3) Among the schools with mechanical engineering departments, only the Provincial Advanced Technical School and the private Chuyi School have better factory equipment and can undertake the task of manufacturing mechanical components. If the design of various machines is more difficult, they can imitate the imported small-scale soap-making, oil-making, and printing machines that are commonly used to promote new local industries. Other schools with metalworking departments with poorer factory equipment should immediately respond to local production conditions, pay attention to repairs, equip various parts, and manufacture new agricultural tools, hardware miscellaneous parts, and other work for practical use.</p>
<p>(4) The ceramic products of the Provincial Guiyang No. 5 Vocational School are still considerable, but the school site is remote and transportation is inconvenient. The school relocation plan proposed by the Department of Education is indeed a crucial plan and should be implemented. The Provincial Zhijiang No. 6 Vocational School originally had three departments: oil painting, applied chemistry, and agriculture. Due to simple equipment, it is quite difficult to operate. One or two departments should be discontinued in accordance with the principle of single-department establishment, so as to concentrate efforts and focus on rectification.</p>
<p>(5) Changsha Private Hengcui and Autonomous Minfan, such as girls' vocational schools, either concurrently run embroidery and sewing departments or specialize in sewing departments, and the results are considerable. Other similar schools with better results should be convened to contact each other and establish a product research association to seek improvement. It can be handled according to the following principles: A. In terms of embroidery, in addition to the original landscape, flower, and bird screens and couplets, and patterned tablecloths and cushions that are commonly seen by Chinese people, new European and American patterns and foreign social habits and consumer habits should be studied to prepare for sales overseas. These items must be beautiful and practical. In addition, major European and American projects, contemporary scientists from various countries, portraits of celebrities, and other famous works of art from ancient and modern times can also be widely collected to enrich teaching materials and produce high-quality products with artistic value. B. In terms of sewing, it is generally practical. The cooperative formed by students and graduates of various schools offers clothing at lower prices, but exquisite Western-style clothing and uniforms are inferior to those sold in stores. Women's accessories have not yet been taken into account. It is best to divide them into exquisite and regular types according to social needs. The price of exquisite products can be appropriately increased, which can not only meet the needs of high-end consumers in society, but also improve students' work skills. C. The product research association should hold exhibitions for observation and facilitate sales.</p>
<p>(6) The principals of provincial vocational schools and the teachers in charge of vocational departments have too few opportunities to contact the industrial and commercial sectors outside the province. The Department of Education should send them to factories and vocational schools in Shanghai and Guangzhou in rotation for planned visits and inspections to learn from them. There must be at least two people for each common subject. It can be held in stages by year depending on the financial situation, but the visiting personnel must have the obligation to report the gains from the visit to other provincial schools with the same department.</p>
<p>(7) Vocational education in Hunan Province lacks an organization for research and promotion. If the funds are limited and the previously established vocational education committee cannot be restored, the Department of Education can convene enthusiastic people from the education community and specialized technical personnel to form a consulting and design group to promote it.</p>
<p>(8) If the provincial vocational schools are to be reorganized according to their original situation, the initial step should be to complete the relocation plan for the Advanced Agricultural School, the continued construction plan for the Advanced Technical School, the addition of factory equipment for Baoqing No. 4 Vocational School, and the relocation of school buildings for Guiyang No. 5 Vocational School, which are the most urgent and should be allocated funds as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Minister of Education Wang Shijie Proposes</h3>
<p>Establishing Two Industrial and Agricultural Schools</p>
<p>Opening Fee of One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Has Been Approved by the Boxer Indemnity Fund</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 24th) Minister of Education Wang Shijie believes that since 1924, universities have been established everywhere, but there is no one that focuses on vocational training that can serve as a national model. This has resulted in a lack of technicians, foremen, ordinary engineers, and farm technicians that society needs. No one is responsible for the practical work of proofing, supervising, and arranging farms, which is a major defect in China's education. To remedy this, he requested that the British Boxer Indemnity Agency allocate funds in succession to centrally run two schools in suitable locations, one of an engineering nature, focusing on machinery, civil engineering, electrical engineering, and applied chemistry, and one of an agronomic nature, focusing on rural agriculture, horticulture, sericulture, etc. The opening fee for the two schools is estimated at one million yuan, which has been approved. The Ministry of Education is currently negotiating with the Boxer Indemnity to allocate funds.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan and Liu Zhanen</h3>
<p>Opinions on Reforming the Education System</p>
<p>Many people in the educational circles of Peking and Tianjin, such as Jiang Menglin and Hu Shi, believe that the existing education system is not perfect. They have jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to modify the education system. The original text has been published in various newspapers. This reporter visited Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, and Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, to inquire about their opinions. They told us the following:</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan's View: Mr. Pan greatly agrees with the principle of the proposal to modify the existing education system proposed by Hu Shi, Jiang Menglin, and others in the educational circles of Peking and Tianjin. He believes that the existing education system does have areas that urgently need to be reformed.</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen's Opinion: Mr. Liu strongly agrees with the reform of the education system and believes that the system should be unified. The implementation of a system is the responsibility of the whole country. If the whole country can implement the same system, the effect will be great. Mr. Liu also believes that the implementation of a system must be tested. Only after testing can we know the merits and demerits of the system. Mr. Liu also believes that there are too many flaws in the existing education system and that a good education system is needed. Mr. Liu believes that the proposal of Hu Shi and others is of great value and has submitted his opinions to the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Brothers Ye Yanhua</h3>
<p>Will Go to Nanjing Today to Petition</p>
<p>Before Leaving Japan, They Were Warned by the Japanese Not to Expand Publicity</p>
<p>After Arriving in Shanghai, Their Words and Actions Were Greatly Restrained, and They Did Not Dare to Reveal Their Grievances</p>
<p>Ye Muhua, a overseas Chinese in Japan, was brutally murdered in Japan. His brothers, Ye Yanhua and Ye Lunshi, in order to appeal to the motherland, report the truth of Muhua's brutal murder, and receive education in the motherland, specially arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru the day before yesterday. Because the Ye brothers were severely threatened by a certain party before leaving Japan, they were very cautious in their actions after arriving in Shanghai. It is learned that the Ye brothers have planned to take the train to Nanjing today to report to the government. The reporter of Shenshi News Agency specially inquired about the details as follows:</p>
<p>Actions Greatly Restrained The Ye brothers returned to China together to appeal to all parties and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. For the sake of convenience, the Foreign Affairs Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the pier to take care of them. After arriving in Shanghai, the Ye brothers went to temporarily stay at the home of a relative on Caishi Road in the French Concession. Their words and actions were greatly restrained. When people from all sides went to visit, the Ye brothers declined to see them all, because there was some unspeakable pain. According to inquiries by the reporter of Shenshi News Agency, when the Ye brothers departed from Nagasaki, they were severely threatened and warned by a certain police authority, stating that they were not allowed to expand publicity in the country after returning to China, otherwise the property and lives of their families would not be protected, etc. After they returned to Shanghai, they felt that they were being monitored, so although they returned to the country with a belly full of anger, the pain of killing their brother and the shame of the nation could not be expressed to the compatriots in the country. The depth of their inner pain can be imagined.</p>
<p>Will Go to Nanjing Today to Petition The Ye brothers have decided to take the train to Nanjing this morning to pay their respects to the authorities to report and request something. Yanhua also plans to find a school in Nanjing to enroll in and receive education in the motherland. Muhua and his brothers were all born in Japan and were influenced by the education there. They can hardly understand a word of the national language, but their heart of longing for the motherland has become more and more urgent under the influence of what they have seen and heard in Japan. Before Muhua was brutally murdered, the brothers had discussed with their parents and prepared to return to the country to study. They first moved from Kumamoto to the Overseas Chinese Elementary School in Nagasaki to make up for Chinese language. It was during this period that the tragedy occurred. Yanhua's mental stimulation was even deeper, so he decided to return to the country to study and no longer planned to return to Japan.</p>
<p>Private Prosecution Demands Compensation The criminal part of the Muhua murder case has been decided by the Japanese court under an unfair trial. The civil part has been filed in civil private prosecution with the court by Muhua's father, Ye Xiuyi, demanding compensation of 16,000 yuan. However, judging from the fact that the Japanese side is punishing the murderers, it is expected that it will be difficult to obtain satisfactory results. It is heard that Muhua's eldest brother, Lunshi, will still return to Japan after Yanhua's study is arranged to take care of the family affairs in Japan, and will decide to return to the country with his family within a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Various Schools and Cultural Groups Participate</h3>
<p>Confucius's Birthday Commemoration</p>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Education Issued an Order Yesterday to Notify</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an order to various large, medium, and elementary schools and cultural groups in the city, stating, "This bureau has successively received Order No. 9641 from the Ministry of Education and Order No. 10002 from the Municipal Government, with attached Confucius's Birthday Commemoration Measures and Commemoration Order Form, ordering compliance and relaying them to the subordinates for compliance. We immediately prepared everything and designated the Dacheng Hall of the Nan City Mass Education Hall as the commemoration location. We have submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval and decided to convene people from all walks of life to hold a Confucius Commemoration Conference in the Dacheng Hall. However, in commemorating Confucius, our education circles should express respect to revere the saint's virtues. In addition to sending separate letters of notification, we hereby order that each school send one representative with the school's certificate letter to attend the commemoration meeting at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th. Please comply with this order."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Sends</h3>
<p>Chief Secretary Lei to Qufu to Worship Confucius</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 24th) The Ministry of Education sent Lei Zhen, Chief Secretary of the General Affairs Department, to represent the Ministry of Education in participating in the Confucius Birthday Sacrifice Ceremony. Lei is scheduled to leave for Qufu from Pu on the afternoon of the 25th.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Orders All Schools Not to</h3>
<p>Withhold Transfer Certificates on Pretexts</p>
<p>And Should Use the Transfer Certificates Made by the Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an order to all secondary schools, stating, "Students have the freedom to choose schools and transfer schools within the scope permitted by law. According to Article 72 of the Middle School Regulations, 'Middle school students who pass the examination at the end of the semester or academic year may request the school to issue a transfer certificate if they must transfer to another school or if there is a situation stipulated in Article 62.' Article 62 states, 'Students who have no semester grade in a subject or whose grades are failing in more than three subjects, or only two subjects have no semester grade or are failing, but the subjects are any two of the four subjects of Chinese, English, Mathematics, and Labor in junior high school, or any two of the subjects of Chinese, English, Mathematics, and Physics in senior high school, should be demoted to the school in the lower semester. If there is no corresponding grade in this school, a transfer certificate may be issued.' Therefore, within the scope of the above regulations, students may request the school to issue a transfer certificate for transfer. However, it has been found that various secondary schools in this city often fail to comply with the above regulations and withhold transfer certificates on pretexts, which is inappropriate. Furthermore, all schools should use the transfer certificates made by this bureau when issuing transfer certificates and must not use other documents as substitutes for transfer. An order has been issued, but a few schools have still failed to comply effectively, which is also wrong. All of the above situations are expected to be corrected by each school if there are any, and if not, they should work harder. Schools must not create difficulties for students transferring schools on pretexts, so as not to interfere with the merit order. An urgent order to comply with this order."</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Formulates</h3>
<p>Uniform Measures for Student Uniforms</p>
<p>To Be Announced and Implemented Soon</p>
<p>In order to unify the uniforms of students in public and private secondary and elementary schools in the city, the Municipal Bureau of Education has formulated uniform measures in accordance with the Ministry of Education's Regulations on Student Uniforms, taking into account the local conditions in the city. It has convened principals of secondary and elementary schools to consult on the opinions a few days ago, and they have generally been decided. However, the Municipal Bureau of Education has telegraphed the Ministry for instructions on whether to use student uniforms or Zhongshan suits for senior high school boys' uniforms, and whether to use hard-top or soft-top military caps. Once a reply is received, it can be decided, announced, and implemented.</p>

At that time, there will be a scene of revelry. It is also heard that the Shanghai Social Education Society has entrusted Mr. Feng to investigate the general situation of social education in Japan and various European and American countries for reference.</p>
<h3>Industrialist Yu Zhiqing Establishes School</h3>
<p>With a Huge Sum of 100,000 Yuan to Establish Deyuan Elementary School</p>
<p>Yu Zhiqing, a tycoon in the local industrial and commercial circles, a Ningbo native, is usually enthusiastic about social undertakings, especially caring for children's education. Seeing that there is a lack of good elementary schools in the Hongqiao area of western Shanghai, and most of the poor children are out of school, Mr. Yu specially spent 100,000 yuan to establish Deyuan Elementary School on Jinji Bridge Road, Xujiahui, western Shanghai, which held its opening ceremony the day before yesterday. Tang Puyu, a representative from the Municipal Bureau of Education, and the school's Chairman of the Board, Yu Zhiqing, and directors Xue Fuji, Wu Zhesheng, guests Wang Liwu, and more than 300 teachers and students attended. Mr. Yu first reported on the process of establishing the school, followed by speeches by guests Wang Liwu and others, with many encouragements. Famous figures in Shanghai, such as Du Yuesheng, Yang Hu, and Wang Xiaolai, all presented plaques to express their respect. It is heard that the school also waives and reduces fees for the children of workers for the sake of popularizing education, so as to cultivate talents.</p>
<h3>Rural Old Customs</h3>
<p>The Qingmiao Society is About to Rise Again</p>
<p>Welcoming Gods and Feasting Reaches the Pinnacle of Superstition</p>
<p>The County Agricultural Education Center Actively Carries Out Reforms</p>
<p>Every year during the new autumn season in the countryside, there is a practice of the Qingmiao Society, where gods are welcomed with feasts to pray for a bountiful harvest. Each village forms a group, and the villagers prepare wine and dishes, gathering with relatives and friends to connect and strengthen their bonds. The average cost per household is more than ten yuan. In these times of rural destitution, it is necessary to eliminate this practice. However, due to long-standing habits, it is difficult to reform it immediately. The 15th Rural Improvement Conference of the Zhuanqiao Farmer Education Center resolved to utilize the Qingmiao Society to showcase agricultural products and exempt them from taxes. The trial will start in the Kangjiazhai basic education area on the 29th of this month. Farmers will bring out their agricultural products, gather them for display, and allow people to observe, compare the quality of the products, and provide rewards. This way, it will truly match the name and purpose of the Qingmiao Society. No idols will be set up in the society. In addition to lectures, a storyteller will be invited to sing stories of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, in order to reform bad habits and save money.</p>
<h3>News from Various Schools</h3>
<p>Sanmin Public School: The Sanmin Public School, registered with the Education Bureau of Jielu City, held its opening ceremony yesterday. More than 600 new and old students and parents attended. Principal Huang gave an opening speech and reported on the improvement plan for this semester. Educational films, including industry films and comedies, were also shown. This semester, the enrollment has been expanded by 400 students, and there are still vacancies.</p>
<p>Minhua Vocational Middle School: Minhua Vocational Primary and Secondary School on Kangnuo Road and Yanping Road has been making unremitting efforts to improve its facilities this semester. Recently, the sports field has been expanded, and sports equipment has been added. The school has also been striving to purchase books and instruments. In recent days, many people have been coming to the school to complete the admission procedures in accordance with the regulations. It is also heard that the supplementary school requested by the out-of-school youths near the school will start classes soon.</p>
<p>Tongyi Middle School: Tongyi Middle School, a private school located at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Malang Road in the British Concession, has already started school on August 23rd. New and old students are busy completing the admission procedures. It is heard that the school has expanded its enrollment due to the large number of new student applications and decided to continue enrollment. Starting this semester, in order to reduce the burden on parents of students from other places and poor children, a portion of the fees payable will be reduced to promote education.</p>
<p>Tangxi Primary School: Since the Education Bureau appointed the new principal Yuan Dingchang to Tangxi Primary School in Tangqiao Town, Pudong, the school's layout has been completely renewed in just over ten days. The school has already started on the 22nd, with more than two hundred new and old students. During the opening ceremony, the principal reported in detail on the school's future plans, which are said to be the most essential and practical. In terms of teaching and moral education, the school plans to organize a ten-person group to avoid Wang Jingwei-style passive teaching and to promote the realization of the "little teacher" system.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's</h3>
<p>Children's Health Camp (4)</p>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>Family Contact: There were a total of 59 children, with a roughly equal number of boys and girls. Most of their families were in business, followed by academia, and then the medical field. The press and legal professions also accounted for a considerable number. The families were mostly middle-class or above. This is something we should pay attention to. In the first few days of the camp, some parents came to visit every day. This seemed inappropriate because it was easy to bring infectious germs into the camp, which would harm the overall situation. Secondly, when children saw their parents, siblings, they would inevitably feel reluctant to part and develop "homesickness." Although there were many children in the camp and life was comfortable, "leaving home for a mile is not as good as staying at home." This is "a universal feeling, a common sentiment." Therefore, the camp formulated visitation rules, setting Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays as visitation days. The visitation restrictions in foreign summer camps are very strict. Since China's national conditions are different and this is the first time we are doing this, it's okay to relax a little. When children entered the camp, they often brought a lot of money, books, and snacks. This was detrimental to the camp rules and harmful to their health. Therefore, everything was collected and returned to their families separately, explaining the advantages and disadvantages. Fruits and fruit juices were returned and used at designated times in the rest area. However, it is always best not to bring them to the camp because the camp provides appropriate food and drink, so there is no need to bring your own. The camp asked the children to write letters to persuade their parents about these issues, which was not only very interesting but also very effective. In the fifth week, a family day was held, and people from all walks of life were invited to watch performances of daily life. The personality, physical and mental shortcomings, and character of each child were reported to the parents in detail so that they could find ways to correct them and continue the orderly and good life of the camp after they left. The toothbrushes used by the children were not suitable, and the toothpaste could not be used because of the strong mint flavor. Therefore, the Family Industry Society, Children's Dental Hospital, physicians Gu Hailing and Su Jielang came to the camp to distribute toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouthwash, and trained the children in brushing methods. They also gave each parent a booklet on oral hygiene to promote it. Food is a very important thing. Fearing that some parents were not clear about it, the camp asked the Yamei Company to donate the book "Children's Nutrition" by Su Zofei and send it to the parents so that they could follow it. Dr. Fei Kunnian was also invited to give a lecture on "Bathing" to correct past mistakes. Health education penetrates into the family. In the future, children will teach adults, and their progress can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Financial Report: After Mr. Pan Gongzhan became the director of the Education Bureau and Mr. Li Tingan became the director of the Health Bureau of Shanghai, a "Central Plan for Health Education" was published. Last year, we wanted to run a summer camp for children with tuberculosis in Gaoqiao, but due to various difficulties, our courage was suppressed, and it eventually became a bubble. This spring, the two bureaus sent me to Japan to study health education. Seeing their rapid progress, I couldn't help but sigh three times. After returning to China, I immediately engaged in the establishment of this camp. Coincidentally, Zhang Wei and Zhang Junjun of the Chinese Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, the Children's Welfare Association, and the Children's Morning News also had the intention of running such a business. Therefore, our five institutions jointly managed it. Each institution contributed 200 gold, totaling 1,000 yuan, and each sent a portion of its staff to work in the camp. As a result, the 1,000 yuan was still insufficient. In addition to the 15 yuan per child, totaling over 800 yuan, there was still a shortage of about 400 gold. The use of funds is now reported as follows: (1) Subsidies for the teaching director and teachers found outside: 200 yuan. (2) Wages: 100 yuan. (3) Travel expenses: 150 yuan. (4) Food expenses: 400 yuan. (5) Nutritious products (milk, tofu, pulp, etc.): 200 yuan. (6) Fruits: 120 yuan. (7) Fuel: 50 yuan. (8) Laundry: 120 yuan. (9) Haircuts: 14 yuan. (10) Water and electricity: 150 yuan. (11) Stationery: 50 yuan. (12) Teaching materials: 50 yuan. (13) Equipment (toys, phonographs, etc.): 200 yuan. (14) Miscellaneous expenses: 150 yuan. (15) Posters and advertisements: 50 yuan, totaling 2,004 yuan. This is the estimated amount for the fourth week. At least 20 yuan was subsidized for each child. The newspaper advertisements were donated by major pharmacies and bookstores such as Zhongxi, Jicheng, and Zhongfa. Some of the equipment, such as the radio, small animals, and baseball, were borrowed by the author himself. The milk was also discounted by Liyuan Dairy Farm. The people in charge, doctors, and nurses all volunteered. Lu Zaiming's kitchen also volunteered half the time. Otherwise, several hundred yuan would have been spent without seeing anything. This is the help from society that we should thank. (The End)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Pingjin</h3>
<p>Bian E Xiang Bao Ji Wan</p>
<p>Improve Physical Education in Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, a physical education supervisor of the Ministry of Education, inspected the physical education facilities of primary and secondary schools in Beiping, Tianjin, Kaifeng, Wuchang, Changsha, Baoding, Jinan, Anqing, and other places when he inspected the physical education of colleges and universities in the above-mentioned places. In Beiping, he inspected 68 middle schools and 12 primary schools. In Tianjin, he inspected 19 middle schools and 7 primary schools. In Kaifeng, he inspected 24 middle schools and 11 primary schools. In Wuchang, he inspected 9 middle schools and 8 primary schools. In Changsha, he inspected 26 middle schools. In Baoding, he inspected 5 middle schools. In Jinan, he inspected 7 middle schools. In Anqing, he inspected 12 middle schools. In total, he inspected 170 middle schools and 38 primary schools. He has recently reported the points that should be commonly improved in the physical education of primary and secondary schools in the above-mentioned places to the Ministry of Education. On the 23rd, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments of the above-mentioned provinces and cities, instructing them to order the schools to pay attention to the improvement. The original order said, "According to the report submitted by Hao Gengsheng, the supervisor of the Ministry of Education, on the inspection of physical education in primary and secondary schools in Beiping, Tianjin, Kaifeng, Wuchang, Changsha, Baoding, Jinan, Anqing, etc., after investigation, all the points mentioned are appropriate. In addition to separate orders, the original report is now urgently excerpted and instructed separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Most schools often hold morning exercises and recess exercises to improve the health of students' minds and bodies and to cultivate students' habits of loving sports. The intention is good, but generally physical education teachers stick to the old methods and do not change. The teaching materials they use are too old, which leads to students perfunctorily following the routine and not benefiting in any way. The Ministry should issue an order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, instructing the primary and secondary schools under their jurisdiction to adopt new German-style natural exercise teaching materials for morning exercises and recess exercises. (The newly compiled "Detailed Items for Physical Education Teaching in Primary and Secondary Schools" by the Ministry has this teaching material for reference) to improve the situation.</p>
<p>(2) Most schools' physical education teachers often hold other positions or teach other subjects, rather than being full-time physical education teachers. If their duties are not specialized, their spirit will inevitably be scattered. It is already impossible to expect them to settle down and work hard. How can we expect them to work hard to improve and systematically develop physical education? In view of this situation, the Ministry should order all schools to hire full-time physical education teachers in the future and not allow them to teach or hold positions in other schools.</p>
<p>(3) Recently, secondary schools have often neglected students' daily life problems, such as food and lodging. Dormitory rules are extremely lax, and food and drink management is entrusted to students, which leads to a group of young students being unruly and unrestrained, without any restraint. They sleep at irregular hours, eat irregular amounts, and even shout and make noise, doing everything. This not only affects the school's discipline but also hinders the health of students' bodies. From now on, all schools should be strictly ordered to pay attention to the students' food and lodging problems so that students can have a stable life. They should comply with this order and report it.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Peking Duck</h3>
<p>— Yongcai</p>
<p>After reading the description of Empress Dowager Cixi and ducks in "Records of Imperial Fragrance," I thought of Peking ducks. Peking ducks, anyone who has been to Peking has probably tasted this unique roasted duck.</p>
<p>Peking ducks and roasted ducks from other places can be said to be fundamentally different. (1) Special Duck Raising Method: All the duck feed is carefully selected. Every meal is to feed the duck until it is full, because they are afraid that the duck will lose weight if it exercises too much. They are not allowed to swim in the water and are kept in the garden all day long. (2) Roasting Method: Although it is the same as other places, the fuel is different. The fuel for roasting ducks is not ordinary firewood, but jujube tree branches. It is said that this is also a reason for the deliciousness of Peking ducks. (3) Eating Method: In the south, roasted duck is always a side dish. Although it is sometimes used as a main dish, it can be said that it is very rare. Peking duck is not like this. There are at least ten restaurants in Peking that specialize in roasted duck. After sitting down in the restaurant, the waiters will bring a few raw ducks for you to choose from. After a while, they will bring the freshly selected duck roasted and show it to you whole. Then two waiters will stand outside the door, one cutting and the other plating, sending the meat and skin up in basins. The way to eat it is to roll the duck meat and skin in thin pancakes made of flour, commonly known as lotus leaf pancakes, smear them with some sauce, and eat them together. The duck bones and duck head are usually not served, but a large pot of soup is cooked with some Tianjin cabbage. If you are still not full after eating, you can ask them to stir-fry a large plate of noodles with duck oil. (4) The price is not expensive either. A duck that is enough for three people to eat, combined with other food, will not cost more than three yuan no matter what. This is also the main reason why Peking ducks are popular.</p>
<p>Speaking of Peking ducks, everyone will think of Yuhuattai outside the Qianmen Gate of Peking. It is said that this shop has been around for fifty or sixty years and specializes in roasted ducks. Business is still booming today.</p>
<h3>Melon Talk</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>It is popularly said that watermelon seeds come from the West, hence the name watermelon. This saying is not credible. If we follow this, then winter melon (also written as winter melon), pumpkin, and northern melon will all come from the East, South, and North, respectively? Watermelons are mostly round, but the melons in Dezhou are long. Because their shape resembles a pillow, they are called "pillow melons." Their taste is incomparably sweet. In recent years, melon vendors in the capital have planted this variety, so there are many pillow melons in the capital. However, their taste is much inferior to that of real Dezhou pillow melons, which is due to the soil quality. This year, the Nanjing Business Office of the Jinpu Railway is handling Dezhou pillow melons on behalf of them. The cost per load, including freight, is only four yuan and sixty-five cents. The locals in the capital can all enjoy a delicious meal.</p>
<p>Muskmelon is a fine product among melons. It is extremely small, like a honeydew melon, and its taste is extremely fresh. Unfortunately, it is not available in large quantities, which is quite regrettable for melon lovers! It is said that there are many melons planted in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in the capital, including Sānbái, pillow, and muskmelons. However, the production is not large, and it is not easy to buy them unless you are a person with important qualifications.</p>
<p>Sānbái melons have white skin, white flesh, and white seeds, hence the name Sānbái. They are also a fine product among melons. It is said that those produced in Suzhou are the best. Not only is the flesh of the watermelon edible, but also the skin and seeds are edible. The outer skin of the melon can be peeled off, cut into thin strips, pickled with salt, and mixed with sesame sauce and oil. It has a unique flavor and is a wonderful accompaniment to porridge. The seeds are stir-fried with salt water, which is no different from those sold in the market.</p>
<p>This year, due to the lack of rain, the melons are mostly weak and small, and their sweetness is even less than in previous years. The melon growers are discouraged by this blow, because they rely on this season's business to make a living for the whole year.</p>
<h3>Ice Cream</h3>
<p>— Nailing</p>
<p>Ever since we knew how to use ice to make food, the name "ice cream" has become "popular without being promoted." No matter what poor and remote place it is, as long as there is an "ice cream" vendor there, everyone will know this westernized name. I think that among the "foreign words" translated from English, none is more popular and widespread than this "ice cream"! Because "ice cream" makes you feel cool all over when you eat it, this thing is sold everywhere in the summer, and there are many, many people who eat it. It is said that when "ice cream" first appeared, many people were afraid of it because people who were not used to eating it would have their teeth ache as if they had swallowed a ball of fire. However, after a while, everyone got used to eating it and it became an indispensable blessing in the summer.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in Guangzhou in previous years, I often gathered with two or three colleagues in the summer, collected a yuan or a few dimes, and made a phone call to Chengji in Henan (the most famous ice cream shop in Guangzhou). In a moment, a whole bucket of "ice cream" was delivered. Then everyone surrounded the bucket and used bowls instead of cups to gorge on the "ice cream." Thinking of this happy way of eating, I still find it very interesting! However, I heard that the writer Peng Jiahua, who died last year, became ill from eating too much "ice cream," and as a result, his intestines broke down and he died of fright! There are so many contradictions in the world. Delicious things cannot be eaten too much, and good things are not often encountered. It is indeed meaningless to be a human being!</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Eggs</h3>
<p>— Guanying</p>
<p>"Selling Gaoyou eggs!" Recently, I have often heard this clear and sharp shouting in the streets and alleys. Among them are women, children, young adults, and old women. They all carry a basket of white, fresh, and clean duck eggs in their hands, shouting along the street. Judging from their clothes and earthy appearance, they have undoubtedly just run out of the countryside. In recent years, the bankruptcy of the rural economy has made it impossible for them to live in peace. They have all brought this unique local product - duck eggs - from the cities to sell and make a living. This situation is pitiful enough.</p>
<p>Usually, Gaoyou eggs cannot be bought for less than ten or even eleven or twelve cents in shops and stalls. Now, you can buy them for seven or eight cents from them. This is of course due to their simplicity and innocence, not knowing how to deceive and raise prices. But in this time of falling prices for everything, how can they not lower the price to sell? In fact, seven or eight cents a piece is really worth eating. Cut open, the fresh, yellow, and oily color inside makes people love it, and the excellent taste is indeed incomparable to those produced elsewhere. On these summer evenings, taking a cool bath, it is a real treat to eat it with mung bean porridge.</p>
<p>Gaoyou is a county in northern Jiangsu, a city along the Grand Canal. West of the river is a vast expanse of Gaobao Lake, with fertile land. Most of the residents along the lake rely on duck raising for their livelihood, in groups of thousands. Because the supply of fish, shrimp, and other ingredients is sufficient and convenient, the eggs they produce are exceptionally plump and delicious. The most famous is a double-yolk egg, which is larger than ordinary eggs. The yolk inside has the size of two ordinary eggs, which is because two eggs are produced together. When the author was studying in Huaiyin in his early years, he passed through Gaoyou, and when the boat docked at the dock, many rural women came on board to sell them. I once tasted a double-yolk egg. The color was fresh and the taste was delicious, which was far better than usual, and it is still memorable to this day.</p>
<h3>Modern Drinks</h3>
<p>— Zui Zhang</p>
<p>These days are the days of modernization. Everything will only thrive if it is modern. Even the street ice drink stalls by the roadside in Shanghai have become modernized. They also sell shaved ice with fresh oranges, and a straw is inserted diagonally into the cup. For compatriots of the lower and middle classes, spending a small amount of money to enjoy modern drinks in a modern way to relieve the intense heat is, of course, a very affordable thing. Therefore, this kind of modernized street ice drink stall is often full of customers.</p>
<p>But when we try to investigate the raw materials of the fresh orange shaved ice at street ice drink stalls, we can't help but be shocked. The main raw material for fresh orange shaved ice is, of course, fresh orange juice. In a glass or porcelain container, there is a fire-yellow liquid filled to the brim, and several cut-open Florida oranges float on top of the liquid. Has the water been boiled? Is the fire-yellow color dyed with toxic dyes? That is unknown. But if you go and carefully observe those cut-open Florida oranges, you can immediately discover that, whether on the skin or inside, there are often patches of grayish-black spots. It turns out that the owners of the ice drink stalls, greedy for cheap prices, buy rotten goods from fruit shops, cut off the terribly rotten parts, and throw them on the surface of the water as a facade.</p>
<p>As for the straw used to suck the ice water, that's even more unspeakable. Originally, the reason for using a straw to drink soda or ice water was to avoid the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, after a straw has been used, it should be discarded immediately. But the owners of the street ice drink stalls are surprisingly stingy. The straw used by customer A is often inserted into customer B's cup after a while. The straw is made of paper, and after being soaked several times, it is, of course, limp and shapeless. If customer A has an infectious disease, the germs will undoubtedly be transmitted to customer B.</p>
<p>In this extraordinarily hot weather, everyone naturally wants to enjoy some refreshing drinks. But for those whose economic means are not very sufficient, one could consider: boiling a pot of water, adding a little white sugar to it, buying a few cents' worth of crushed ice to chill it thoroughly, and wouldn't that also be refreshingly cool? Why must one put on airs and drink this nominally modern, but actually not, drink, swallowing the juice of rotten fruit and the germs of unknown infectious diseases together?</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Zhiweiguan's Wonton</h3>
<p>— (Gray Horse)</p>
<p>Anyone who goes to Hangzhou for leisure must look for a few snack restaurants on the lake. But upon entering, one invariably eats two famous Hangzhou dishes, such as sweet and sour bream, clear-braised river shrimp, stir-fried shrimp kernels... and so on.</p>
<p>Yes, the water in West Lake is so clear and lively, so lovely; therefore, it cannot help but evoke the thought of eating special products from the water.</p>
<p>However, "Zhiweiguan" is also a famous restaurant in Hangzhou, and its business is very good. Its wontons are very famous. If you run in and eat a bowl of delicious shrimp wontons and drink a bowl of Huadiao wine, it's more flavorful than eating a few dollars' worth of snacks.</p>
<p>Having visited West Lake once, it is a pity that many people have never even tasted the wontons of "Zhiweiguan".</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: The large wontons of Hongxing Restaurant in the Ta Jian Nong in Gong Xiang Branch Alley in Suzhou are even better than those of Zhiweiguan. Those who know the taste can speak of this.)</p>
<h3>Wuxi's Crispy Eel and Jiangyin's Soft Eel</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>I have lived in Jiangyin for generations, so please let me talk about Jiangyin first.</p>
<p>Jiangyin is located on the Yangtze River. In the Former Qing Dynasty, it was the place where students from the eight counties north and south of the Yangtze River, including Wuxi, Changshu, Jingjiang, and Taixing, gathered to take the imperial examinations to become scholars. At that time, the noodles of Jiangyin's Xinjing Garden were highly praised by the students from the seven neighboring counties. And in the summer, the best side dish to go with the noodles was, of course, eel shreds! For example, if we now invite three or five friends to walk into a restaurant in Jiangyin (whether you are eating noodles or drinking alcohol), the dishes that fill the table, besides one or two plates of "shrimp fry," are all eel shreds. And if you don't have enough to eat, the waiter will keep adding them. This shows how good Jiangyin is at eating eel shreds.</p>
<p>But eel shreds can be divided into crispy eel and soft eel. Crispy eel seems to be a specialty of Wuxi. Although Jiangyin also has it occasionally, it is not as well-made as Wuxi, just right. Conversely, soft eel is a specialty of Jiangyin, and there is none in Wuxi restaurants at all.</p>
<p>Once, passing through Wuxi, a friend from Wuxi invited me to eat noodles. When a plate of crispy eel was served, the friend proudly introduced it, saying: "This is crispy eel, a specialty of Wuxi, and there is none in other places." I ate a few chopsticks. Although I felt it was crispy and delicious, I always felt it was not as flavorful as Jiangyin's soft eel. So I then said: "Yes, although there is no crispy eel in other places, our Jiangyin's soft eel is even more flavorful. If you have the chance, please come to our county to try it and compare it!" At that time, that friend did not respond, and his eyes fully revealed a kind of disbelief. He thought that Wuxi's crispy eel should be unparalleled.</p>
<p>Another time passing through Wuxi, that friend smiled and said to me: "Indeed, indeed, Jiangyin's soft eel is much more delicious than Wuxi's crispy eel, and its taste is truly profound!" That friend had read ancient books, so his speech was very elegant. Later, I learned that he had gone to Jiangyin with several friends and tasted the delicious soft eel. "Hearing is not as good as tasting." The previous contempt had turned into today's praise, which was not surprising.</p>
<p>I have digressed too much. Now let me talk about the methods of making crispy eel and soft eel.</p>
<p>(1) Preliminary preparation: The so-called preliminary preparation is the same for both crispy eel and soft eel. That is to say, take live and kicking eels, kill them, remove their intestines, wash away the dirty blood, and then put them into boiling water for about two or three minutes before捞ing them out. (Some people also put the whole live eel into boiling water and then捞it out to wash and debone it, but that is a bit too dirty.) After捞ing it out, you can use a sharp little knife to cut open the eel's backbone left and right, and the backbone will naturally be removed, leaving only pure meat. At this point, the preliminary preparation is complete.</p>
<p>(2) Method of making crispy eel: First, mix one-fifth of wine, one-fifth and five of sugar, two-fifths of soy sauce, and five-tenths of salt, plus three or five slices of old ginger to enhance the flavor. Then put the washed eel shreds in and soak them thoroughly for about twenty minutes (the longer the better, if time permits). After that, take them out and put them into a boiling oil pot immediately (lard is best, soybean oil is also acceptable).撈 it out when it is slightly withered but not yet deteriorated, and it is crispy eel. When eating, it is fragrant and crispy, and you can dip it in vinegar or sesame oil to eat, as you like.</p>
<p>(3) Method of making soft eel: To make soft eel, the eel shreds are first fried in an oil pot, which is exactly the opposite of the order of steps in making crispy eel. When making soft eel, the degree of cooking in the oil pot must not be to the point of withering. When the whole body is wrinkled and the core is also cooked through, you can definitely take it out. After taking it out, you can soak it in a seasoning similar to that used for crispy eel. It is best to use a copper pot to stew it over a low flame for half an hour, otherwise, soaking it for three to five hours will also work. When eating, there is juice, so you don't need to dip it in anything. Jiangyin people like to add some ginger shreds to eat.</p>
<p>The methods of making crispy eel and soft eel have been briefly described above. The focus of whether it is cooked well or not lies entirely in the combination of the ingredients and the duration of frying in oil! If the reader can fry it according to this method, they will not be fooled. As for whether it is done well or not, that is the specialty of the chefs in Wuxi and Jiangyin, and we will not be able to learn it easily.</p>
<p>Personally, I have always been an admirer of soft eel, and its taste is much more profound than that of crispy eel.</p>

<p>Large Speculators Vigorously Covering Short Positions</p>
<p>Mark-Up Soars Nine Yuan Twenty Cents</p>
<p>Devaluation of US Dollar Hopeless, Exchange Market Tight</p>
<p>Guangdong Banks Strive to Supply, High After-Hours Trading</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw large short positions covered by speculators, and speculator Wu also entered the market. The situation was exceptionally bullish throughout the day. In the morning, although the overseas silver market rose sharply, the underlying market was still good. London spot gold rose half a penny, and exchange rates were consistently lower. US cotton rose nine pounds, and US wheat fell eight seventy-five. Stocks fell slightly, and commodities opened at fifty-one yuan, with some wavering. Reuters reported that the US had a large batch of gold to be shipped abroad, including 1,000,000 yuan from the Manhattan Bank and 2,500,000 from Reich &amp; Fellier to France, as well as two batches of 280,000 yuan from the Bank Trust Company to Belgium. The exchange rate was expected to fall, boosting confidence. The gold industry's preparatory trading opened and rose to over fifty-two yuan. After the opening, the banks initially dumped their holdings, with recent US dollars being loose and weak. HSBC's listing remained unchanged. Although large speculators tried to push up prices, there was still resistance. However, rumors of a shrinking exchange rate spread frequently, boosting confidence. Chinese merchants exerted their efforts, and the domestic US dollar market tightened. There were many buyers in the market, and the situation was bullish. With large speculators repeatedly covering positions, even with supplies from Guangdong banks, there was still a shortage of gold. Gold prices suddenly rose, almost approaching the sixty-yuan mark. Afterwards, the banks continued to dump their holdings while prices were high, and Guangdong banks also sold gold bars, gradually moving downwards, but still struggling. When Reuters reported that the US Treasury Department announced that a portion of the 20,823,514 yuan in silver certificates had already been circulated, the exchange market relaxed and fell again. However, large speculators continued to cover positions, and the situation stabilized at noon. The after-hours market was bolstered by rumors that the Treasury Department and bankers were meeting again in Lushan to discuss countermeasures to prevent the outflow of silver. Confidence remained strong, and large speculators such as Zhengchang and Fuyu aggressively covered positions, again approaching the sixty-yuan mark. With the efforts of Chinese merchants, the exchange market also tightened. However, due to the repeated supply of gold bars from Guangdong banks, there was still much wavering. The sentiment was very bullish throughout the day, as foreign news reported that the US Treasury Department announced that if the US dollar fell below its par value, gold would be allowed to flow out. It was also said that if the US dollar depreciated further, the Treasury Department would sell gold. And the Associated Press confirmed that the US Treasury Department did not intend to reduce the fineness of the US dollar again, and that there would be no changes in monetary policy this year. The exchange rate was expected to fall, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 952 yuan and 40 cents, up 3.5 yuan from the previous close. Commodities opened at 2.8 yuan, due to Reuters' report that gold was flowing out of the US. The exchange market opened with recent sales prices at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 6875, and the US dollar at 35 yuan 4375. Citibank dumped US dollars for September at 375, and Fuyu, Zhaofeng, Chang, Daxing, Yongda, and Decheng all advanced, rising to 3.5 yuan. McGillicuddy dumped US dollars for November at 5625, and Dafa, Yongwan, Xing, Yuqing, Yongyi, Chengyuan, and Hengyu all sold. Citibank came out with US dollars for September at half a yuan, falling to 1.6 yuan. Yuanfeng, Yongyu, Yuqing, Yongfu, An, Hengyu, and Yicheng advanced gold bars, rising to over 3 yuan. At this time, it was learned that HSBC's listing for both British and American currencies was flat, and the situation was stable. The bank came out with recent US dollars being very loose. Dafa, Yongzai, Decheng, and Yuanyi sold their holdings, retreating to 2.1 yuan. Huixiang, Daxing, and Yongjin reached over 3 yuan and continued to trade. Fuyu, Zhaofeng, Chang, Bingxing, Fuan, Yiyu, Chunyuan, and Yongjin reached around 4 yuan. Yongfeng and others supplied, but still struggled. Later, US dollars for October at 4375 were difficult to settle. Huixiang, Jiatai, Hengyu, Tongchun, Zhaofeng, Chang, Yuanmao, Yonghong, Lihong, Kang, Yongda, Xing, Yongyuan, Chunshun, Mao, Dade, Chengyi, Feng, Yongheng, Xingyuan, and Yuanchang Yong also aggressively advanced, rising to over 6.5 yuan. Meifeng came out with US dollars for November at 4375, and Yuanmao Yong aggressively sold gold bars, slightly declining, but still hovering around 6 yuan. However, the Chinese merchants' aggressive settlement was surprisingly brave, and the domestic market tightened again. Daxing Yong, Yifeng, Yongyuan, Chuntai, Dade, Cheng Zhengchang, Zhaofeng Chang, Qingfa, Yongchunyuan, Yongheng Yu, and others' buying interest was greatly boosted, and it rose to 9 yuan. Paribas came out with US dollars for November at 3125, and Yuqing Yongda, Lianbang, Senchang, Yong, and Zhaofeng Chang sold, retreating to 7.5 yuan. Dade and Qianchangxiang still advanced, and it rose to 8.4 yuan. Hengxing, Hongli, Fuyu, and Dade came to sell gold bars again. Paribas came out with US dollars for October at 3125, and it fell to 5.5 yuan. Fuxing Yong and Yongli took the opportunity to advance gold bars, rising back to 7 yuan. Finally, Fuyu, Tongchun, Chunyuan, Yong, and Yongfeng sold more heavily, and it fell again to 5.8 yuan. Daxing Yong, Qianchangxiang, and Natiao closed at 956 yuan and 40 cents at noon, and commodities were auctioned at the same price.</p>
<p>The after-hours market opened at 956 yuan, and commodities opened at 6.2 yuan. Dingkang Yuanchang Yong sold at 5.8 yuan. Fuyu commodities and Fuxing Yong advanced gold bars. Chinese merchants continued to cover positions, rising to 7.1 yuan. Hengxing aggressively sold, and it fell to 6.8 yuan.

Zhengchang, Dachangxiang, Yuqing, Yongfu An, Yongli, Futai Heng, Senchang Yong, and others aggressively rushed to buy, and it rose to 9.6 yuan. Zhaofeng Chang, Dade, Cheng Yuanmao Yong still came to aggressively sell, gradually moving downwards. Although there was struggle, the closing price retreated to 958 yuan and 10 cents due to the Guangdong banks' unabated selling intention. Commodities were auctioned at the same price. After the market closed, Yuanmao Yong and others still sold, and it was more tired, retreating to 7.2-3 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 959 yuan and 60 cents, and the lowest price was 951 yuan and 60 cents, with a total fluctuation of 8 yuan. As a result, it rose 9 yuan and 20 cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on HSBC Bank's US dollar listing remaining unchanged at 35 yuan, resulting in a mark-up price of 988 yuan and change. According to the closing price, it was about 30 yuan, which was 9 yuan less than the previous close. The registered prices for this month were 962 yuan, September 958 yuan, and October 956 yuan. The supplementary water prices were 962 yuan in the morning and 964 yuan in the afternoon. Refined gold still added 12 yuan, and the listed price was 964 yuan and 40 cents. The spot market situation was sluggish. In the morning, only Tianjin banks made a deal of over 1,000 taels with each other, adding 15.5 yuan. In the afternoon, the mark-up continued to rise, and there were many sellers at this price. All spot numbers were willing to supply, but there was a lack of appetite. The swap price was advanced by Dafa Yong by one yuan in the morning, and then stood at about one yuan. In the after-hours market, Hongxing Yong paid Yingfenghheng 105 gold bars at a price of 1.6 yuan. In addition, the turnover was relatively quiet. There were still 21 gold bars left for this month, and 2,387 gold bars left for September. In total, there were 14 long positions and 9 short positions.</p>

<h3>Continued Rise in Foreign Call Loans, Head Money Remains the Same</h3>
<p>Since the export of large amounts of silver, the financial market has suffered a period of panic. Although people's minds have slightly stabilized at present, the reserves have indeed decreased, resulting in a continued rise in the market price of foreign call loans. The morning and noon rates yesterday were 15 cents, an increase of 2 cents from the previous day. However, after the head money fell sharply a few days ago, the market demand has not improved, resulting in it still hovering between 5 cents and 3 cents, without any honor or disgrace. The turnover of call loan transactions was over 3.9 million in the morning market and over 200,000 in the afternoon market. The turnover in the Small General Association was over 400,000. The turnover of foreign mortgage transactions was over 2.3 million for redemption and new transactions. The turnover of banknote transactions was over 600,000 for collection and over 900,000 for issuance, with over 900,000 collected in cash. The bank's collection and settlement of foreign banks' collection and settlement of bill payments was over 2.0 million, remittance payments were over 500,000, and the collection and settlement of various remittance goods, mortgages, and miscellaneous payments were over 4.2 million, with 600,000 released from the warehouse. The Chinese banks' collection and settlement of bill payments was over 2.6 million, foreign exchange settlement was over 800,000, and the collection and settlement of various goods, remittance pledges, taxes, and miscellaneous payments was over 4.3 million, with 400,000 entering the warehouse.

Also, the total number of exchanges by the city's bill exchange office on the 24th was 7,498,229.1 yuan in silver dollars, including 3,483,378.34 yuan in silver dollars and 4,014,850.076 yuan in remittance silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Copper Coins All Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the auxiliary currency market was very stable, but only the Jiangnan small foreign coins were still bullish. The morning market opened well by one yuan, trading at 834 yuan. The noon market increased by another 50 cents, to 834.5 yuan. As a result, it rose by 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day, with each trading at 5,000 coins in both the morning and noon markets. The Guangdong small foreign coins were no different from the previous day, with both the morning and noon markets still at 740.3 yuan, with each trading at 85,000 coins in the morning market and 60,000 coins in the noon market. Copper coins were still at 327,000 cash, the same as the previous day, and the trading price was 8,300 yuan, totaling 27,141 strings of cash.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Short Squeeze Leads to Decline</h3>
<p>=Small amounts decline by 3-4 corners to 1.5 yuan=</p>
<p>=Afternoon Session Opens at 6 PM=</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market did not experience a squeeze due to the approaching settlement date. Instead, only hedging and closing transactions occurred. The overall trend remained a short squeeze. Regarding the silver issue, there was a move to increase tax rates, which should reduce outflows. The external environment did not seem to pose significant problems, and the trend was not expected to fluctuate greatly. Today is the last day for this month's futures, and the trend may be volatile. Yesterday, the opening trend showed weakness. Although there were sell orders for the 4th, many large long positions emerged, causing the market price to uniformly decline by 1-2 corners to 5-6 corners. The 22nd Customs fell by 7.5 corners. Consequently, the second session did not show any signs of recovery, and sellers remained enthusiastic, continuing the decline by 2-3 corners to 5-6 corners. In the afternoon, only one session was held, but due to other reasons, it was delayed until 6 PM. The trend remained weak, with military bonds falling another half yuan. Other stocks also generally declined by 2-3-5 corners. The trend seemed weary and unable to recover. However, due to the approaching settlement date, the market price became unpredictable, with sudden rises and falls, often deviating from the norm, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. The final market result was a uniform decline, ranging from small amounts of 3-4 corners to 1.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 20 million yuan. The resulting price changes are compared and listed on the left:</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Stagnant and Lifeless</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Company, the declaration made yesterday (the 23rd) by Finance Minister Morgenthau Jr. completely dispelled rumors of inflation, leading to a rather uneventful trading session on the New York Stock Exchange, and the market temporarily lost its direction. However, the stock market trend leaned downwards, as people generally lacked interest in trading. Gold and silver mining stocks suffered significant losses, and copper mining stocks also showed signs of weakness. The small exchange market was mixed, with mining stocks, oil stocks, and canned food stocks remaining firm, while public utility stocks were weak. In the public bond market, government bonds rebounded due to the strength of the US dollar, while others were stagnant and directionless. Reports of right-wing developments in the rain and in Washington caused long positions in Chicago to be closed, leading to a downward trend in the grain market. The total daily transaction volume was 750,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>|  | 22nd | 23rd | Change |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 30 Industrial Stocks | 94.32 | 94.05 | Down 0.27 |</p>
<p>| 20 Railroad Stocks | 37.24 | 37.14 | Down 0.10 |</p>
<p>| 20 Public Utility Stocks | 21.04 | 21.08 | Up 0.04 |</p>
<p>| 40 Bonds | 93.15 | 93.18 | Up 0.03 |</p>
<p>| 11 Commodities | 63.33 | 64.11 | Up 1.22 |</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Standard Yarn Still Remains Stable</p>
<p>The yarn market remains sluggish. Consignees for this month are still uncertain, and sellers are putting strong pressure on the market, which is affecting forward months. According to investigations, tomorrow is the last day of this month, and foreign firms still have open positions of 3,000 to 4,000 bales. Therefore, the market price for this month may still change. In general, the yarn stocks in warehouses cannot be moved in large quantities, putting short sellers at ease.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Firm) The opening of the standard yarn market was influenced by the rise in American cotton, but the market remained weak due to the current month's settlement. Forward months were slightly higher. In the second and third sessions, the yarn market was driven up by the rising cotton prices, leading to short covering. As a result, all months rose by 2, 3, 4, and 6 corners. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot yarn transactions were slow, and the market sentiment eased, with all months falling by 1, 2, 3, and 4 corners. The total daily transaction volume was 23,750 bales. According to the records, Renfeng sold 1,100 bales, Yuanyi 1,150 bales, Dachang 1,050 bales, Ruidai 1,300 bales, Hengchang 400 bales, and Dafu 450 bales. Gengfeng bought 400 bales, Tongji 1,050 bales, Jinchang 500 bales, Shenchang 950 bales, Yuanda 300 bales, Changfeng 550 bales, and Deji 350 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>| Standard Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| August | 181.2 | 180.5 | 181.0 | Up 0.30 | 19,850 |</p>
<p>| September | 182.7 | 181.8 | 182.5 | Up 0.40 | 55,550 |</p>
<p>| October | 184.4 | 183.6 | 184.0 | Up 0.20 | 64,700 |</p>

<p>| Total |  |  |  |  | 295,350 |</p>
<p>(Few Spot Sales) Spot yarn sales remain slow. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 625 bales for the day. Prices were flat. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland 85, Yunnan 200, Tianjin 75, Wenzhou 15, Ningbo 20, Guangdong 53, Peers 140, Haizhou 25</p>
<h3>Firewood Gang Covers Short Positions in Standard Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending higher. The autumn weather remains dry, and cotton trees have suffered significant damage, leading to rising expectations. The firewood gang is covering short positions in large quantities. A certain company also profited and bought back positions. The market is gradually rising. However, spot cotton transactions are relatively quiet. If the dry weather continues, the October price may reach beyond 6 yuan.</p>
<p>(Forward Zheng Standard Up by 3.5 Corners) The opening of the standard cotton market saw Indian cotton falling by 2.4 rupees and American cotton rising slightly by 6 to 10 points. Buying interest is strong, as the recent dry autumn weather is unfavorable for cotton, and cotton seedlings are at risk of withering. As a result, large players are profiting, and shorts are covering their positions. The firewood gang is also buying in large quantities to cover their positions, leading to a tightening of the market. All months are up by 1, 2, and 3 corners, except for the current month, which fell by 2 corners due to fewer consignees. The afternoon trend remained firm, with all months rising by another 5 to 10 fen. The total daily transaction volume was 128,600 dan. According to the records, Dachang sold 2,600 dan, Xiecheng 1,500 dan, Hengde 2,200 dan, Changji 2,400 dan, Huikang 1,100 dan, Jinchang 2,900 dan, Yuanda 5,000 dan, Gengfeng 1,700 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, Shenji 2,200 dan, Yichang 1,700 dan, Xincheng 2,400 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,700 dan, Changhe 2,700 dan, Xiesheng 1,500 dan, and Yifeng 1,900 dan. Dafu bought 11,000 dan, Jifeng 1,800 dan, Dafeng 1,300 dan, Xiecheng 1,900 dan, Dachang 1,600 dan, Xinheng 7,500 dan, Yukang 1,400 dan, Yuda 1,800 dan, Yuanyi 2,900 dan, and Changfeng 5,600 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>| Standard Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| August | 34.95 | 34.65 | 34.80 | Down 0.05 | 69,100 |</p>

<p>| Total |  |  |  |  | 842,700 |</p>
<p>(Raw Cotton Mills Need to Continue but Not Significantly) Spot cotton sales are slightly better. The source is estimated to be 750 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Sha City Cotton 40.75, Dakang Mill 500 pieces, spot goods sent to factory. Firewood Cotton 38.50, Dongmian Bank 1,000 bales, September-October, also Yao Cotton 39.00, Hengfeng Mill 1,600 bales, two weeks, also Lingbao Cotton 51.00, also 99 pieces, spot goods, also</p>
<h3>American Cotton Turns to Rising Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather for American cotton was good, but it was offset by buying from the Liverpool gang and the strength of Wall Street. As a result, spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures rose by 1 to 9 points. English cotton futures rose by 12 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly with American cotton, but later softened due to selling by speculators and profit-taking by long positions. As a result, Pingguoer and Aomula fell by 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 4.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 23rd):</p>
<p>| American Cotton | Change from Previous Day | Equivalent in National Currency | English Cotton | Change from Previous Day | Equivalent in National Currency |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| October | 13.24 | Up 9 | 41.70 | August | 6.89 | Up 2 | 46.10 |</p>
<p>| December | 13.38 | Up 7 | 42.10 | September | 6.88 | Up 2 | 46.00 |</p>

<h3>Shanghai Japanese Factories</h3>
<p>Fine Yarn Losses, Coarse Yarn Profits</p>
<p>Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai are finding it increasingly difficult to calculate costs after the increase in cotton import tariffs. Based on recent cotton prices, the cost of producing Japanese yarn using American cotton for 21s/42s is comparable to the market price, with almost no losses. 32s and 40s require a loss of 10 to 15 yuan per bale, while 16s and 20s can generate a profit of 2 to 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain: Flour Futures Rise After Opening</h3>
<p>Wheat Prices Show Little Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, various months initially showed a flat and then rising trend. The quoted price for foreign wheat in Chicago was around 2-3 corners, and Canadian wheat was slightly better by 1-2 corners. At the opening, the price for the current month was slightly lower by 1 fen, while the price for September remained unchanged. Starting from October, mainland buyers gradually absorbed the supply, as the prolonged drought and disappointing autumn harvest caused rice prices to rise uncontrollably due to high demand. Consequently, those involved were actively speculating, and the market followed this trend, returning to firm and higher prices. By the fourth session, prices had rebounded by about 2 fen compared to the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, mainland buyers continued to push forward from the previous session, and buyers from Yingkou and other regions also slightly increased their purchases. In addition, the market sentiment also improved, so the opening price showed a profit. For example, December and January had once again exceeded the 7-corner mark. Considering the fearsome nature of natural disasters, the future of the people's food supply may be heading towards panic. It is unknown whether the government authorities have taken precautionary measures. As a result, the current month was better by 3 fen and 7.5 li compared to the previous day, September rose by 5 fen and 2.5 li, October rose by 4 fen and 7.5 li, November rose by 5 fen and 2.5 li, December improved by 5 fen and 2.5 li, and January improved by 4 fen.</p>
<h3>20,000 Bags of Spot Wheat Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market prices for various months were generally stable, with varying quotations for foreign wheat. The market sentiment, due to the current month being for spot goods, was unable to fluctuate, and the market remained stable throughout. Although the market sentiment for forward months was tight, there were very few buyers, and both internal and external long positions were watching, resulting in very few transactions. The market also saw a very slight rise. However, since the flour market was showing a profit, the wheat market would likely follow suit and enter a high price range, which is also an unavoidable fact. As a result, August and September were each better by 1 fen, October was better by 3 fen, November was better by 2 fen, December was better by 3 fen, and January was better by 1 fen. The spot wheat market remained stable due to pressure from the mills. Shandong, Bengbu, Xuzhou, and Guide wheat opened at 4 yuan, Liuhe and Gaoyou wheat at 3 yuan and 9 corners, Yaowan wheat at 3 yuan, 9 corners, and 8 fen, and Anqing wheat at 3 yuan, 9 corners, and 3 fen. Fuxin took 15,000 bags, and Zaofeng took 5,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Sha City Coarse Indica Rice Rises Sharply by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Open Interest in Yang Rice Futures Exceeds 30,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market rose across the board. Yang rice (foreign rice) attracted the attention of local traders, and both futures and spot markets were active. Over 7,000 bags of spot Xiaojiao (small-grained rice) opened, with the higher-priced ones rising slightly. Zhongguan Xiaojiao (Central Customs Xiaojiao) did not rise by 2-3 corners. 500 bags of spot Saigon rice opened, with prices also improving slightly by 1 corner. Futures trading was active in both buying and selling, with only traders and foreign merchants selling, stabilizing the market. The entire city opened with a total of 30,000 bags for loading and delivery on the 3rd-4th of September and the 9th-10th of October, including the recycled goods sold and bought by rice merchants.</p>
<p>Machine-milled coarse and regular Indica rice were even more sought after than Yang rice. Because Yang rice had road goods and futures openings, the spot market price could not rise sharply. Due to the prohibition of transportation in various regions, production prices of Ke Shan (Guest Shan) rice were high, and both incoming and remaining supplies were scarce. On the contrary, there was competition from various inland groups for procurement, so the prices of high-grade and secondary goods rose by 3-4 corners across the board. In particular, Ke Cao (Guest Coarse) rice was being procured by both local and inland parties. Traders were also inquiring. Since there was a shortage of spot goods on the market, the newly arrived 3,000 bags of Sha City coarse rice and one small cart of Mingguang coarse rice were quickly sold. The old rice from Sha City coarse rice rose to 10 yuan and 2 corners, and the new rice also reached 9 yuan and 45 corners, a jump of more than 1 yuan compared to the last selling price at the beginning of this week: 9 yuan and 5 fen for old rice and 8 yuan and 1.5 corners for new rice. Mingguang coarse rice, despite its inferior quality, also opened at 10 yuan. Xiang Qi (Hunan Flag) reached 10 yuan and 3 corners, up a large 4 corners. Zhangzhou rice also reached 12 yuan and 1.5 corners. Xiang Ji Jingda (Hunan Machine Jingda) rice ranged from 10 yuan and 8.5 corners to 11 yuan and 1 corner, all showing a rising trend. A total of less than 3,000 bags of machine-milled Qi (Flag) and various Indica rice opened, mainly due to the scarcity of both incoming and remaining supplies. Therefore, people still expect prices to rise further.</p>
<h3>Lower River Rice Market Quite Firm</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for various groups were still only the 13th and 14th (goods totaled nearly 2,000 shi), and sales were still flat. Fortunately, people's hearts are still firm, and the market still presents a stable situation. However, the issue of dining plates was relatively tight because the market yesterday was too enthusiastic. Therefore, the prices of thick Japonica rice and late-season rice only increased by 5 fen for the high-quality ones, and the prices of the mid-market ones were all fixed. Doyangjian and Yinbianyuan, due to the lack of goods, had some movement and continued to show strength. Zhou Pudongxin and Xinchang factory goods were of higher quality, with prices opening at 11 yuan and 7 corners. Dingxintai factory opened at 11 yuan and 5 corners.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various routes in the Lower River was the 11th and 12th. All goods went quickly in the morning, but the market turned sluggish in the afternoon. The market shape was such that the price of white glutinous rice and thin rice rose by a corner, and the price of Baiyuan early rice, Yangdujian, and Kejian increased by 1-2 corners. Dongxin japonica rice was in short supply.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Spot Goods Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slightly tight due to Customs Gold, with the closing price at 1.935. The trend turned positive. The Association's designated price for ordinary spot goods of 24 raw sugar white was 19 yuan and 7.5 corners, and the price for our stock was 19 yuan and 8.5 corners, up 5 fen from the previous day. The transshipment goods arriving on the 26th were very small, ranging from 6 yuan, 4 corners, and 7 fen to 4 corners and 5 fen. Spot goods of Dutch red sugar were 15 yuan and 1 corner, Taikoo Sugar B mark was 20 yuan and 1 corner, Zhenyu No. 1 native cotton white sugar was 18 yuan and 7.5 corners, and No. 2 was 18 yuan and 5.5 corners, all without any fluctuations. There were still few transactions of Chaoqing sugar, with only a few dozen bags of Ban Nanqing sugar sold at 13 yuan and 2 corners.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Jinshan Flat Branches Suddenly Rise by Six Yuan</p>
<p>Jinshan flat branches have recently been driven by sales from the Henan group, and market prices have gradually become tighter. The quoted price has also risen accordingly, and the market price has been called higher, with a sudden increase of 5-6 yuan compared to before, making it quite firm.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil's Rising Momentum Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of white tung oil in the Hankou market has been rising steadily because the route to foreign merchants is particularly smooth. Last week, the price was still only 29 yuan and 7-8 corners per dan, but it quickly rose sharply to 30 yuan and 8 corners. Then, it rebounded slightly to 30 yuan and 2 corners, but in an instant, it rose again to 30 yuan and 7-8 corners. Yesterday, it was still selling for 31 yuan and 1 corner and 5 fen. Last night's news added up to 31 yuan and 4 corners and 5 fen. The momentum is still strong. Based on the current situation, it seems that there is a possibility of further rises. Recalling the situation of the previous rising trend, whenever it reached above 30 yuan, it reached a peak. Foreign merchants would stop buying. Sources would gather, and various factors would come together to curb the rising trend and create a rebound. Therefore, every time it rises above 30 yuan, the eyes of the crowd will inevitably change. It is still not certain whether this time it can break out of the previous routine, open up a new face, and create a new record. Therefore, although the market trend is strong, people cannot help but have some concerns. Zhejiang is experiencing a prolonged drought, and the river water in the upper reaches of the Zhijiang River is extremely dry. Therefore, shipping is difficult. Hangzhou merchants have run out of stock, and it is unknown when the source will be smooth. It is heard that the current market requires 29 yuan per dan delivered to Shanghai, and not many can be handled. The stock of local trading houses has also been exhausted, and the remaining stock is scarce. Fortunately, sales are also scattered, so it is not enough to be stretched.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Floral Cloth and Serge Sales Quite Brisk</h3>
<p>Among the woolen fabrics, the transactions of fabrics have continued to be prosperous in recent days. Local stores in this street have all started handling them, and both incoming and outgoing credit business are extremely prosperous. Floral cloth, serge, Walter cloth, Yuanqing Zhigong cloth, domestic striped and solid-colored camel fleece all have transactions. Transactions in fabric and foreign goods stores in the Qipan Street and Xiaodongmen area in the South City are particularly prosperous. Sales of both domestic and foreign fabrics are good. Tianxiang's modern brand striped camel fleece sells for 1 yuan and 2.5 corners per yard wholesale, Duhe brand for 1 yuan and 6 corners, Xianhe brand for 1 yuan and 9 corners, Invincible brand wool back for 2 yuan and 4.5 corners, Art for 1 yuan and 7 corners, Yoshida 305 3 yuan, Changhui serge for 2 yuan and 9.5 corners, Miye Jili Ge Hailingpeng for 5 yuan and 5 corners, and Ningfeng medium-thick serge for 4 yuan and 8 corners.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Construction Department Distributes Autumn Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department, in order to develop the autumn silkworm industry, is implementing a unified silkworm egg management method. It has specially ordered 600,000 sheets of improved autumn silkworm egg paper from silkworm egg manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and is generally encouraging farmers to purchase and raise them as much as possible. It began distributing the egg paper on the 20th, and in three days, a total of 540,000 sheets of autumn eggs were distributed, which is estimated to produce more than 100,000 dan of cocoons.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Factory Ships Silk to Shanghai for Storage</h3>
<p>A total of 30 silk factories in Wuxi started operations after the new cocoons came on the market. Later, European and American silk sales were sluggish, and the stored silk could not be sold. A total of 5-6 factories have successively shut down. Currently, only more than 20 factories are barely operating. However, overseas silk sales have still not improved, and inventories are thick. They can only ship silk to Shanghai for temporary mortgage loans to maintain operations. In recent days, a total of about 200 pieces of Wuxi white silk have been loaded and shipped, stored in various banks, money shops, and warehouses, waiting for the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Needle Eyebrow Green Tea Transactions Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port, the needle eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Hexian Road, etc., was also being heavily searched by British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Tongfu, and Jinlong, and transactions were exceptionally brisk. The high-quality goods from Wuyuan North Road were selling for 54-55 yuan, and the medium- and low-quality goods were selling for 25-30 yuan, with no significant changes from the previous day. For Zhenmei green tea, transactions of cored goods were still active, while ordinary goods remained sparse. The remaining items such as Xiamu Gongxi had no large sales. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. reopened the market for Qimen Lianghu black tea yesterday, but the market was slightly lower due to the small number of routes.</p>
<h3>Hardware: German and Italian Tinplate Prices Soar</h3>
<p>According to telegrams from Berlin and Rome yesterday, tinplate prices have soared again. For example, the price of 90-pound double-length tinplate is 41 shillings per box, a huge increase of 6 shillings compared to before. According to the current exchange rate, this is equivalent to about 36.5 yuan in Shanghai (while the recent estimate in Shanghai is around 30 yuan, a difference of up to 6 yuan). The price of 100-pound double-length tinplate is 43 shillings per box, equivalent to about 39 yuan in Shanghai. However, the market is only selling for 32 yuan and 5 corners. As a result, people in this port are exceptionally confident and expect prices to rise further. In addition, according to telegrams regarding 200-pound Huisi iron, the factory has no stock available for order in the next two to three months and must wait until mid-November to December before there is surplus stock for sale. The recent market price is 29-30 yuan per box.</p>
<h3>Pig Iron Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Although pig iron transactions have not been prosperous recently, the market is still good, and prices remain firm. For example, No. 1 Indian goods are opening at 66 yuan, No. 2 at 64 yuan and 5 corners, Yangtze goods No. 1 are opening at 64 yuan, and No. 2 at 63 yuan.</p>

<h3>On Morality and Literature</h3>
<p>— Youmo Jun</p>
<p>This summer, as the summer vacation was approaching, I received concern from various friends who wrote to inquire about my whereabouts after the summer. They always said that with my moral character and literary talent, the new administration would surely rely on me heavily. However, the outcome did not meet their expectations. So they had to take a step back and write to comfort me, saying that with my moral character and literary talent, there was no need to worry about not being hired. Their kindness is indeed touching; but it could not help but make me greatly doubt the so-called morality and literature.</p>
<p>Estimating a person's morality is inherently as difficult and inaccurate as estimating a student's conduct. Moreover, achieving the level of a "learned person" in literature is also difficult. Furthermore, morality and literature have always been inseparable. I remember reading Zeng Gong's "Letter to Ouyang Sheren" when I was young. Because Ouyang Xiu wrote a tomb inscription for his grandfather Zhiyao, he praised Ouyang Xiu's morality and literature as "appearing only once every few hundred years." However, what exactly was so extraordinary about Ouyang Xiu's morality and literature, even Zeng Gong could not say. This shows how difficult it is to estimate morality and literature. Zeng Gong also divided "human conduct" into five categories: (1) good intentions but bad deeds, (2) treacherous intentions but virtuous appearance, (3) good and evil mixed and cannot be clearly identified, (4) reality greater than reputation, and (5) reputation greater than reality. These five standards seem to be more practical than the five grades of A, B, C, D, and E used in modern schools to estimate students' conduct. However, if I were to use them to estimate my own morality, even I would not know which category I belong to. Even if I were to ask friends to estimate separately, they would probably each give their own estimate, just like teachers grading students' conduct, making it difficult to be accurate. Moreover, these five standards are not true morality!</p>
<p>Therefore, I think: Once one becomes a Chinese literati, it is best to carry a large signboard of "helping the world and guiding education," even though those who have eaten cold pork in the Confucius Temple are few and far between. Precisely because of this, the collections of literati throughout history always contain articles that speak on behalf of the sages or say flattering words to their masters. In this way, one may be worthy of being called "possessing morality and capable of literature." I was born too late, what can I do!</p>

<h3>Dissenting Views on Dissent</h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>In today's China, literature, that sort of thing, must be considered the most unlucky. On one side, some people say angrily, "If literature doesn't die, great disasters won't cease!" On the other side, some people say literature is useless.</p>
<p>Perhaps these two sayings can be combined into one, because literature is useless, not as good as science and engineering, which is why great disasters won't cease.</p>
<p>So, some people stand up to defend it. Like Mr. Wang Pingling, he expresses dissent towards the promotion of science and engineering and the cursing of literature, saying that China has been advocating science and engineering for "sixty years," "spending countless tens of millions of gold pounds of the country's scholarship fees," but "no one has ever openly advocated a literary movement, the country has never sacrificed a scholarship fee for literature, and the government has never had the slightest plan for literary facilities." He also believes that "if this continues, Chinese literature will definitely die; however, after literature dies, whether great disasters can cease, this responsibility will have to be completely borne by those who study science and engineering."</p>
<p>We can agree with his defense of literature. However, there are a few dissenting views here that need to be raised.</p>
<p>It is true that the country has never sacrificed a scholarship fee for literature. But one point is not fully expressed, this does not refer to all fees, it does not mean that the country has not sacrificed any fees for literature other than scholarship fees; fees are not limited to scholarship fees. It is half true to say that no one has openly advocated a literary movement. The New Literature Movement in the May Fourth era was openly advocated. After that, it is indeed fair to say that there has been no open advocacy, and "no one knows why." As for saying that the government has never had the slightest plan for literary facilities, this is completely wrong. Perhaps Mr. Wang thinks the plan is "minute," so he didn't see it. In short, the responsibility for such destruction of literature, or at least the responsibility for ignoring literature, cannot be borne by the national government; and it must also be defended on its behalf.</p>
<p>Regarding the country's attitude towards literature, he also cites Hitler's treatment of Hauptmann, Wagner, Mussolini's treatment of D'Annunzio and intellectuals, France's treatment of Rolland, France, such high praise and preferential treatment, as well as the fact that the Soviet Union's leaders are mostly from the literary and artistic circles, and the Japanese Ministry of Education's assistance in the progress of literature and art, to reflect on China's situation, his words filled with emotion and envy. In fact, this is unnecessary; and there is no need for extensive citations, in China, it has "existed since ancient times," which can be understood in general by looking at the two words "civil governance." However, according to China's "national conditions," such active "veneration of literature" only produced many court literatures; on the contrary, works such as Water Margin, Dream of the Red Chamber, and The Scholars were produced outside of this influence. Therefore, we do not expect the country to venerate literature in any way, climbing too high, it is hard to guarantee that it will not fall heavier, it is better to be more plain.</p>
<p>Therefore, finally, returning to the previous article, let's talk about the uselessness of literature and great disasters. But there are only a few words, since literature is considered useless, then even if there is disaster, the disaster of uselessness is not very big.</p>
<h3>Illness and Writing</h3>
<p>— Xi Dichen</p>
<p>In today's essays and sketches, one often sees texts praising "minor illnesses," saying that minor illnesses are a kind of happiness in life. In addition to getting a little temporary rest from a busy life, it can also allow a heart that is usually tight to relax a bit and fall into a state of light tranquility.</p>
<p>In fact, this peaceful state of mind is most suitable for writing elegant essays. Firstly, the mood during a minor illness is naturally more leisurely, and the observation of surrounding things will be particularly delicate, and it will also seem to feel fresher; secondly, if one inadvertently writes down what one has observed, one will definitely use a light and agile writing style, seemingly just gliding the pen along, without any effort. Good articles can often be obtained at this time, because people are most likely to express "truth" when they are poor and sick.</p>
<p>It is precisely for this reason that articles written during leisure illnesses often make people feel exquisite and lovely, with a fresh flavor. Mr. Yu Dafu's articles are like this. Recently, seeing Mr. Xu Weinan's "Letters from Ji Yun," I couldn't help but have the same feeling.</p>
<p>This collection is a record of the author's stay in Zhapu for a month last year due to a lung illness. (Although it uses the form of letters) The author floats outside of the world, embracing a leisurely mood and child-like interest to observe the mountains, seas, wind, moon, objects, and human feelings of Zhapu, and then writes them down lightly and faintly with a delicate brush, just like a painting, feeling simple and fresh.</p>
<p>The author describes the sea the most. The various postures of the sea in Zhapu on cloudy days and sunny days can be said to be fully captured in the writing. I love the following section the most:</p>
<p>"Watching the sea is a pleasant thing, especially watching the sea at high tide. When the tide rises to the beach, if you look down from the mountain, you can see the tide like pieces stacked on top of each other. One piece of water rushes onto the beach, followed by a second piece of water covering the first piece. This way, one piece covers another, never stopping. Walking down from the mountain to the beach to see the tide is like rolling up, as if it is an unfolding painting, rolling up little by little, and when it reaches the high point of the beach, the painting is rolled up. This is still the scene of the initial high tide, waiting for the high tide (especially on the fourteenth or fifteenth day of the lunar calendar) it is not pieces rushing over, but large chunks leaping over and falling over. When it reaches the beach, it seems extremely angry, jumping up, flying up, roaring loudly, because it is blocked by the stubborn beach, it spits out a pile of white foam and retreats, but then immediately squeezes onto the beach again, as if it must conquer this beach, and later the beach is indeed gradually conquered by the tide. Looking into the distance, the sea water rushing against the edge of the island is like a burst of white smoke. When the sky is illuminated by strong sunlight, the surface of the tide seems to be covered with crystals, rolling over with the crest of the tide, disappearing when it is near the beach. But there is another large pile rolling over in front. Sometimes there are one or two particularly bright spots at the foot of the sea island, like constant lights, always illuminating the sea."</p>
<p>A person's minor illness is truly a person's best rest. In this rest, one can cultivate one's "strength." After reading the above example, one can imagine what great inspiration the author received from the sea.</p>
<p>The author's writing was originally known for its elegance, but now it is even more light and lively.</p>
<h3>3 × 2 = 6 People</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Small Scenes of Malay Villages (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Riding a bicycle along the lanes of the tropical forest, one can see scattered villages dotted among the trees along the way.</p>
<p>An "atap" house built on flat ground and raised on wooden stakes, with tropical red-leaf trees, fragrant flowers, and tropical trees planted in the open space in front of the house. The fence in front of the house is painted green, and inside the house, under a kerosene lamp, are reflected some pictures and porcelain plates. Outside the house, coconut trees or betel nut trees extend on the ground. In the outermost layer, bamboo fences or red flowers are used as fences. Every day, one or two workers lazily holding a Javanese tobacco and doing pruning work are the homes of Malay nobles.</p>
<p>Separated by tropical plants, in other parts are the "atap" houses of Malay commoners. The simple wooden boards and the dark tree-leaf roofs weathered by wind and rain show a dim color under the shadows of the trees. Outside the house, the sound of sheep bleating is heard, and a group of chicks are pecking at the weeds. The homeowner holds a "parang" knife and weaves "atap" leaves. When thirsty, he climbs up the tall coconut tree, picks a fruit, climbs down, uses a knife to cut off the fibrous skin, chisels a small hole, and sucks the juice of the pulp inside. That is the "ice cream" or soda of Malay commoners.</p>
<p>On ordinary days, Malay villages exist in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility. The scorching sun filters its light and shadows on the ground through the gaps in the leaves, and the wind sways gently among the trees. There is often a small stream in front of the house, and next to a Malay boat tied up, Malay children are swimming, playing, and passing the days of the scorching sun in the dark red stream water formed by rainwater.</p>
<p>On hot noon and afternoon, a familiar Chinese would stop a bicycle outside the house, mouth facing the homeowner: "Hello, Shuman, (or other Malay name) please give a coconut to quench my thirst."</p>
<p>And the homeowner would jump down from his work, or wake up from a lazy nap, touch the "parang" knife, and say: "Boss, where did you come from? I'll get it for you."</p>
<p>After the guest finished sucking the juice, the car would roll away on the avenue with green grass and golden sunlight. Then the homeowner would hum a love song, playing and singing with a sheepskin drum in his arms.</p>
<p>Or in the tropical rainstorm, the strong wind shakes the surrounding trees, and raindrops hit the "atap" roof in large drops. A coconut oil lamp would be lit in the house, leaving a trace of light and shadow on the dark earth, illuminating the simple furniture in the house, appearing a mess: a few "sarongs," a bag of rice, a bag of sugar, a can of oil in an old wine bottle, and a few sticks of tobacco... (No bed or chair.) If the wind blows away the leaves, the homeowner would climb onto the roof, holding a knife in his hand and leaves in his mouth, drenched by the rain, and repair the house. - Then the tropical rainstorm would pass.</p>
<h3>Literary Talk Outside the Door</h3>
<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(2) Who Created Characters?</p>
<p>Who created characters?</p>
<p>We are accustomed to hearing that an item was created by a sage in ancient times, and of course we must ask this question about characters. But immediately there is an answer that forgets the origin: characters were created by Cangjie.</p>
<p>This is the view of ordinary scholars, who naturally have their source. I have even seen a portrait of this Cangjie, an old man with four eyes. It can be seen that to create characters, one must have an extraordinary appearance first. People like us with only two eyes are not only not capable enough, but even our appearance is not worthy.</p>
<p>However, the person who wrote the "Book of Changes" (I don't know who it was), was relatively smart. He said, "In ancient times, people governed by knotting ropes; later sages replaced them with writing." He did not say "Cangjie," but only "later sages," did not say creation, but only replacement. He was very cautious; perhaps he inadvertently did not believe that there would be someone in ancient times who created many characters alone, so he just said it vaguely.</p>
<p>But what kind of role were those who used writing to replace knotting ropes? A writer? Yes, judging from the fact that the so-called writers of today are most likely to show off their writing skills, and can do nothing without a pen, one would indeed think of him first; and he should indeed contribute to his own livelihood. However, it is not. People before history, although they sang while working and sang while courting, they did not draft or leave manuscripts, because they never dreamed of selling poems or compiling complete works, and there were no newspapers or bookstores in that society, and writing was useless. According to what some scholars tell us, it is likely that the historian did a lot of work on writing.</p>
<p>In primitive society, there was probably only a witch at first. As things gradually evolved and became more complex, some things, such as sacrifices, hunting, and wars... became necessary to remember, so the witch had no choice but to think of ways to record things in addition to his main job of "inviting spirits." This was the beginning of "history." Moreover, "ascending to heaven," in his official capacity, he also had to burn the records of the chief and the major events under his rule for God to see, so he had to write articles as well -- although this was probably a later development. Later, the responsibilities were divided more clearly, and there were specialized historians. Writing was a necessary tool for historians. The ancients said: "Cangjie was the historian of the Yellow Emperor." The first sentence is not credible, but it points out the relationship between history and writing, which is very interesting. As for the later "writers" who used it to write "Ah, my love, I'm going to die!" those beautiful sentences, that was just enjoying the ready-made, "not worth mentioning"!</p>

<h3>Summary of Shortwave Transmitters (2)</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(2) Automatic Transmitters</p>
<p>(1) Practical Oscillation Circuits: The oscillation methods in automatic transmitters can be roughly divided into the following two categories:</p>
<p>(1) Magnetic induction coupling circuit, (2) Capacitance coupling circuit</p>
<p>When designing a transmitter, the choice of circuit is not very important, because the characteristics of the oscillation circuit are often determined by the circuit's fixed value, the vacuum tube used, and adjustments. Therefore, in order to make the transmitter oscillate at a certain frequency, it is necessary to have a matching circuit composed of coils and capacitors.</p>
<p>The most commonly used ones are the Hartley circuit, the tuned plate and tuned grid circuit, and the Colpitts Circuit.</p>
<p>The so-called Hartley circuit, as shown in the upper right figure, has a common coil, one end of the filament is often connected to the center of the coil, and the plate and grid are connected to its two ends. In this way, FG forms a grid circuit, and FP forms a plate circuit. Usually, the number of coil turns on the plate circuit side is more than that on the grid circuit side. Its oscillation effect is determined by the degree of magnetic induction coupling between the two circuits, so it is necessary to pay attention to the ratio of the number of coil turns.</p>
<p>The so-called Colpitts circuit, as shown in the upper left figure, is to remove the self-inductance in the Hartley circuit and replace it with capacitance. In this method, the oscillation effect is determined by the degree of capacitance coupling between the two circuits, so attention should be paid to the ratio of capacitance.</p>
<p>The tuned plate and tuned grid circuit is also known as the Armstrong circuit, named after Mr. E.H. Armstrong, who invented it, as shown in the figure below. In shortwave, this method does not require external coupling, and the electrical energy in the plate circuit is returned to the grid circuit through the internal capacitance of the vacuum tube to maintain the oscillation state.</p>
<h3>Transmitter Efficiency and Frequency Stability Issues</h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>At present, amateur radio operators in our country are also gradually leaning towards shortwave. The most interesting thing about studying shortwave is making small-power transmitters. The most important thing to pay attention to in a transmitter is how to stabilize the frequency. And because the power is small, efficiency must also be taken into account. Now I will describe these two key points in detail below:</p>
<p>The frequency stability and efficiency of a transmitter are related to each other, although the conditions most suitable for stabilizing the frequency are not necessarily suitable for achieving its highest efficiency in a certain circuit. However, it is generally believed that stabilizing the frequency of a transmitter is the most important issue in the design of a transmitter. The most ideal transmitter should always emit a signal on one frequency, and it should only occupy a minimum position in the high-frequency band. Especially because its electrical energy is completely concentrated on one frequency, it can exert the greatest power. If we pay a little attention when receiving radio, we can find that many radio stations occupy many degrees on the dial, or sometimes although they do not occupy many degrees, they often jump from one degree to another; at the same time, their signals are often blurred and rough. These radio stations do not have ideal frequencies, and they do not have the most stable frequencies.</p>
<p>The reasons for these unstable frequencies can be roughly divided into two categories. The first category is mechanical defects, and the second category is dynamic defects.</p>
<p>Mechanical changes and heating of the transmitter structure can often cause mechanical instability of frequency. For example, changes in the space between the plates of the storage capacitor, changes in the distance between the turns of the coil, and changes in the distance between the electrodes of the vacuum tube can all cause the transmitter frequency to sway. As long as we fix the structure of each part during manufacturing and installation, the above defects can be easily avoided. The change in the distance between the poles of the vacuum tube due to temperature changes, which causes a considerable change in capacitance, is also a reason for frequency sway. The frequency instability caused by this reason can also be avoided by using the vacuum tube's specified power a little less.</p>
<p>Dynamic instability is closely related to the total impedance of the vacuum tube. When transmitting, a change in the total impedance of the plate circuit will greatly affect the frequency. Unstable plate voltage of the transmitter can cause frequency changes. Therefore, it is best not to use a power supply with poor filtering. At the same time, the transmitter should also avoid excessive or insufficient excitation, so the grid excitation voltage or grid leak should be kept at the most suitable value. The best way to avoid dynamic instability is to pay attention to the values of each item in the circuit design and keep them unchanged.</p>
<p>The nature of the transmitter load circuit (including the plate circuit and antenna circuit) and the loss of the grid circuit have a significant relationship to the transmitter efficiency. The so-called plate efficiency refers to the ratio of high-frequency power output to plate input. When calculating the actual overall efficiency of the transmitter, the power consumed on the filament side must also be calculated. Sometimes the loss on the grid circuit side is very large, and the reason is that the grid leak loss is too large or because high-frequency current passes through the grid and filament. The latter can be considered to be due to the excessive capacitance between the grid and filament when the frequency is very high.</p>
<p>For oscillation tubes with extremely high frequencies, it is quite difficult for us to calculate its plate efficiency. However, when the oscillation tube is under regular plate power consumption (usually when the plate is somewhat red), the power output is approximately close to the difference between the plate power input in watts (i.e., DC plate voltage multiplied by plate current in amperes) and the specified plate consumption in watts. To ask for a more accurate value, it is of course necessary to subtract the power consumed by the grid leak. The power consumed by the grid leak is the grid leak resistance multiplied by the square of the grid current.</p>
<p>In short, transmitter efficiency and frequency stability are the most important issues in shortwave transmission, and also the most difficult issues to solve. Using purely calculation methods to investigate will often be further from reality; obviously, it also requires you to expend a lot of brainpower!</p>
<h3>Simple Speech and Telegraph Transmitter for Trial Use</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>- Economical components -</p>
<p>- Easy to manage -</p>
<p>This machine has been tested by the author and friends many times, and the results are very good. The circuit uses the Hartley type to facilitate oscillation and easy management, and the materials used are 80-90% from radio receivers, so it is especially in line with economic conditions.</p>
<h3>Figure 1</h3>
<p>The circuit is shown in Figure 1. When transmitting, just connect the telegraph key to the socket J, and you're done. Figure 2 shows the device for speech transmission, using the grid circuit amplitude modulation method, although it is extremely simple, the effectiveness is not bad, and it is especially convenient for beginners.</p>
<p>The wavelength uses the 40-meter amateur wavelength, so the range is also very considerable. According to the test results, the communication with Xinchang is very good, and speech can reach 70-80 miles, but the effectiveness of the transmitter depends on the adjustment technique.</p>
<p>In the machine, the oscillation coil L uses No. 16 wire to wind six turns on a 3-inch diameter tube. L is the antenna coil, which can be wound six turns with No. 16 wire on a 2 1/2-inch diameter tube.</p>
<h3>Figure 2</h3>
<p>The grid circuit coming out of the B1 connector should use braided wire (or other soft wire), and the wire head should be fitted with a copper clip, which is clipped so that the ratio of this point to the grid to the plate is 1:4 or 1:5.</p>
<p>Application components:</p>
<p>CC1. 00035MFD variable capacitor</p>
<p>C2. 00rMFD fixed capacitor (must withstand voltage (75oV))</p>
<p>C3. 000rMFD fixed capacitor</p>
<p>R ioooo ohm fixed resistor</p>
<p>RFC ordinary eighty or sixty Henry, choke coil self-made: can use No. 30 wire to wind one hundred and twenty turns on a 2 1/2-inch tube.</p>
<p>J closed socket</p>
<p>MT amplitude modulation transformer</p>
<p>MK single-button carbon powder microphone</p>
<p>V 19 vacuum tube</p>
<p>M small light bulb</p>
<p>A battery 2 volts</p>
<p>B battery 100-300 volts dry battery or substitute B battery</p>
<p>The antenna of this machine does not need to be specially made, the ordinary fifty-foot antenna used for radio receivers is sufficient, but attention must be paid to whether the insulation between the antenna and the lead-in wire is good.</p>
<p>For the adjustment method, please refer to Yu's "Introduction to Radio" Volume 6 for detailed instructions, which will not be repeated here due to space limitations.</p>
<h3>Using Red Zinc Ore to Make an Amplifier-Stage Crystal Radio</h3>
<p>— Ying Fu</p>
<p>Ordinary amplification work is done with vacuum tubes, which is something everyone knows, but if you are limited by economy, then it is not impossible to use red zinc ore (Zincite) instead.</p>
<p>Red zinc ore is a natural zinc oxide, its chemical symbol is ZnO, and like galena, it has the ability to detect waves, but it has not been widely adopted for detection because it requires electricity. If it is in contact with a metal, such as steel, or carbon, it can generate alternating current of various frequencies, so under certain combinations, its working condition is very similar to a triode. Russian engineer Rosov once invented using it to make an amplifier.</p>
<p>The following crystal radio is based on Rosov's theory. The results are very good. In this city, it can be used with a small loudspeaker to listen to major radio stations, and it is a bit deafening to listen with headphones. However, powerful loudspeakers cannot be used, because the characteristic is not linear, so it will be very distorted.</p>
<p>The circuit is also very simple, but it is a crystal radio with excellent selectivity, plus a stage of red zinc ore low amplification.</p>
<p>(ZnO) is red zinc ore, first insert a steel nail into a tube, then place it in the ore pan, and then wrap it with a piece of flannel, connect the positive pole to one end of the red zinc ore, and the negative pole to one end of the steel nail.</p>
<p>L uses No. 26 silk-covered wire to wind twenty turns on a small spider web board, and L2 uses the same number wire to wind fifty turns on a large spider web board. After winding, it can be installed on a push-pull frame.</p>
<p>C is a 0.0003 microfarad variable capacitor.</p>
<p>C1, C2 are 0.0001 microfarad variable capacitors.</p>
<p>C3, C4 are 0.002 microfarad fixed capacitors.</p>
<p>D is ordinary crystal, but the quality must be good.</p>
<p>R is a 300 ohm fixed resistor.</p>
<p>R1 is a 1500 ohm variable resistor.</p>
<p>A 40 or 45 volt B battery can be used for the dry battery.</p>
<p>I must mention in passing is the problem of the antenna and ground wire, which must be installed well here. The height of the antenna should be 10 meters, and it is best to use two 40-meter-long ones, in a parallel style, the distance between the style lines is about 1 meter, and the lead-in line is a T-style. The ground wire should be as short as possible, and if it is wrapped around a tap water pipe, it must be wrapped tightly.</p>
<h3>Partitioning</h3>
<p>— Hu Wen'an</p>
<p>In radio, partitioning is used to prevent electrical energy from being transmitted between two circuits. We generally use lead as the best material for partitioning because it has low electrical resistance and is extremely light.</p>
<p>But why is partitioning so necessary? Because any circuit containing alternating current emits a magnetic field and an electrostatic field. The higher the alternating current frequency, the greater the ability to radiate. Therefore, this phenomenon is even more pronounced in radio high-frequency situations. Within a radio receiver, any conductor carrying this frequency of current radiates its energy at any time, causing surrounding conductors to receive it and generating unwanted interference, feedback, and other undesirable results within the receiver.</p>
<p>To avoid the above situation, a large piece of conductor is often placed around high-frequency circuits as a partition. This allows it to absorb the electrical energy released by the former, generating eddy currents and dissipating them in the partition. The consumption of electrical energy can be calculated according to Ohm's law: I² × R. However, at the same time, because current is generated in this partition, it opposes the original circuit, reducing its radiation and lowering the loss of electrical energy. Moreover, the partition's inductive capacity is directly proportional to its current I. Therefore, manufacturers often use thicker partitions to obtain a smaller R value and increase the I value, thus improving the effectiveness of the partition.</p>
<p>In addition to high-frequency amplification, intermediate-frequency amplification tubes, oscillating tubes, and their regulating coils and capacitors must be individually partitioned. The wiring between them should also be partitioned with flexible copper wire tubes.</p>
<p>Partitioning can isolate magnetic fields and separate electrostatic potentials. How is this done? By directly grounding the partition. This assumes that the ground is a permanent neutralizer.</p>
<p>Since the partition absorbs electrical energy, it should be as far away from the object being partitioned as possible within a feasible range. It must also be noted that this partition absolutely cannot be used to conduct any kind of circuit, otherwise, it will lose its original purpose. Therefore, the grounding of the high-frequency circuit wiring in the radio receiver must be gathered in one place and not connected to the chassis at any time, so that the chassis, which has the mission of partitioning, can also serve as a conductor of high-frequency current.</p>
<h3>Using Old Vacuum Tubes as Lightning Arresters</h3>
<p>— Gu Weiyou</p>
<p>Now that the weather is hot, the most feared thing for radios is lightning. If a radio is not equipped with a lightning arrester, there is a risk of it being destroyed by lightning. However, buying a lightning arrester is not cheap. There is a type of carbon resistor lightning arrester, which can only be used once and must be repurchased, which is not economical. For comrades who study radio, there must be vacuum tubes with burned filaments in the laboratory. Now, use them to make a vacuum-type lightning arrester. When the antenna receives high-voltage lightning, it passes through the lead-in wire to the plate of the old vacuum tube and flies to the grid to the ground, becoming a short circuit. It no longer passes through other parts of the radio, so the radio is safe. Moreover, it can still be used after a lightning strike. The connection method is to connect a wire from the antenna terminal to the plate of the old vacuum tube, and then use another wire to connect one end of the ground terminal to the grid of the old vacuum tube. In this way, a lightning arrester is successfully made. The attached diagram is above:</p>
<h3>Simple Lightning Arrester</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiyu</p>
<p>Although this summer is extraordinarily hot, with the scorching sun in the sky and no cool air at all, and the dark clouds have disappeared to who knows where, experience tells us that rain is coming, and the sounds of thunder and lightning will constantly appear in the sky, because this is the so-called season of "continuous autumn rains"!</p>
<p>Isn't it true that those who have radios—with antennas—will suffer at that time? At best, the radio will be damaged; at worst, a fire will be caused.</p>
<p>According to theory, since the antenna of a radio can receive radio waves, needless to say, it must be able to induce atmospheric electricity.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you already have a lightning arrester installed, that's best! If not, please find a way to install one immediately!</p>
<p>The simplest way is to go to a radio supply store and buy one, but it will cost at least one or two yuan to five or six yuan!</p>
<p>Here is an extremely economical, simple, and excellent lightning arrester, which is the result of the author's experience, and its performance is no less than that of ready-made ones on the market.</p>
<p>Find two sections of useless—used-up—small dry batteries, and try to peel off the zinc skin that wraps around them, and then you can see the carbon rod inside. Be careful not to break it when taking it out. Also, prepare a piece of plastic board three inches long and one and a half inches wide, and two wiring nails.</p>
<p>Connect one end of each carbon rod with copper wire, as shown in the diagram.</p>
<h3>Radio</h3>
<p>In the diagram, only one antenna is used to receive the radio, because if the ground wire is also connected like the antenna, then the lightning arrester will be completely ineffective during lightning. If the reader's radio requires the ground wire to be directly connected to the radio, then you might as well install another one, because this ground wire is only for the lightning arrester and has nothing to do with the radio.</p>
<p>As for the distance between the carbon rods, it must be between one and two points. Do not connect them!</p>

<h3>Scientific Disaster</h3>
<p>— Zhaozhao</p>
<p>The other day, another tragic accident occurred in a factory in Shanghai. Before that, there had been multiple boiler explosions in factories, killing and injuring as many as three or four hundred people, and as few as dozens. If anyone were to survey such a disaster site, squeezing in from among the nearby onlookers and the cries of families helping the old and the young, they would see broken walls and collapsed houses, with lingering smoke everywhere. Many rescuers would be dragging out sections of mutilated limbs amidst the pungent, acrid, and fishy odor. Some were already burned into the shape of a bow, others were like charcoal-mixed roast beef, a blur with no way to identify their faces. It was truly a living hell, terrifying and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, from the 16th to the 21st year of the Republic of China, there were a total of 319 factory disasters in the public concession in six years, with a total loss of more than 1.56 million taels of silver. The French concession and the Chinese area were not included. Last year alone, there were 165 industrial disasters in Shanghai, according to newspaper reports, with more than 410 deaths and injuries and losses of more than 2.3 million yuan. In January and February of this year, there were a total of 46 accidents, with 53 deaths and injuries. Most of them were explosions or fires. The number of such disasters is increasing year by year, indicating the neglect of factory safety in all aspects. Although there are many factories in Shanghai, how difficult is it for them to gradually destroy themselves? Men and women who escaped death in the mainland finally had their pitiful lives ended by a mouthful of bitter food!</p>
<p>Originally, when science develops, people's surroundings are full of sharp weapons, and it can also be said that the surroundings are full of dangers. For example, the distribution of urban electricity is as dense as a network, providing transportation, communication, entertainment, cooling, and heating, as well as the passage of coal gas and the supply of steam for power and room temperature, drawbridges, tunnels, high and low cars, trains, dozens of layers of cement buildings... In various forms, each one can lead to a catastrophic disaster if there is no sound scientific method as a basis and insurance.</p>
<p>Then, do so many factories now also have technicians, use science, and do the factory owners and managers not have preventive equipment in advance, or equipment to learn from the disasters of others? If we examine it carefully, we will know that the so-called material science, like politics, law, etc., changes its shape when it comes to China. The result of its implementation is that the weak can be slowly killed, and the strong will immediately give you floods and beasts, causing the country to sink and perish. In short, science becomes a "scientific disaster" when it comes to China.</p>
<p>Let's look at the facts: events such as praying for rain, offering sacrifices, fortune-telling, and automatic writing are still prevalent everywhere in our country. The minds of our nation are still stagnating in a kind of vague influence, an unquestioning metaphysical aspiration, and there is no clear scientific mind above the general level. If you say he is unscientific, he will immediately turn his mind and put a scientific hat on all kinds of old tricks, and then there will be scientific fortune-telling, scientific mediums, etc. Anyway, science is the best in the West. To run a business, just buy one or two sets of "foreign cars" from the red-haired or the Star-Spangled Banner (Shanghai commonly calls machines "cars," and machine managers are called "car managers") and you can use them permanently. The science in schools is just a matter of playing Western tricks by following the examples in the books for a while. What precise observation is there, what accurate understanding is there, and naturally, what experience is there in manipulation. They see foreign factories safe and developed at the same time and place, while they are always catching fire, collapsing, and exploding!</p>
<p>If anyone can go and see the factories of Chinese merchants everywhere, they can see that many factories are simple and crude, with sheds and scaffolding erected haphazardly. Those steel pipes and iron frames are mostly covered with dust and grease, and those brackets and motors make the roof tiles shake. The air in all parts of the factory is turbid, the light is not adjusted, the labor is crowded, and the residual materials are messy. The order is</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>extremely bad. Those factory owners are probably always thinking about how to annex shareholders and become sole proprietors, and the managers are always arranging private affairs, planning to embezzle property, using their positions to benefit themselves. Even if there are a few who shout out the scientific management method, they don't actually understand what science is, but use fashionable slogans to exploit workers and deceive their bosses, with other purposes. The most ridiculous thing is that many of the people who manage factories don't even know the names of the various parts of the machinery, let alone how to use and protect them. They just use a few old foremen from apprentice backgrounds, relying on the experience of the early 19th century, to barely operate the new machinery of the 20th century. They also hire a group of police, constables, old men, and labor scabs, who are densely distributed inside and outside, closing the doors and locking them, and suppressing a group of tame sheep. Once a tragedy occurs, there is no way to escape, and a large number of families die together! Isn't this a scientific disaster?</p>
<p>Scientific disaster! In China, it will cause disasters that others will never cause. And in the world, it has another kind of disaster, that is, artillery, airplanes, tanks, germs, poison gas, and death rays. Countries are exhausting their efforts to research, manufacture, store, and train, preparing to fight for markets and slaughter the poor people of other countries. That is also a kind of scientific disaster, which is not worth mentioning. But today we are too late to mourn their great disaster and we have to blame ourselves for falling and breaking our heads on a flat and walkable road.</p>
<h3>The Sudden Death</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>It was just dawning when he woke up. His body was soft and limp all over, and he was very thirsty. He looked at his wife on the ground, sleeping soundly, her mouth open, her sallow, thin face, and her disheveled hair. She had not slept well for three days, so the husband could not bear to wake her. He forced himself to get up, but when his legs crossed the bed, they were shaky and weak. He bent over and staggered to the table, grabbed the teapot and drank it heartily, and his spirits seemed to be revitalized a little.</p>
<p>They were a couple. The husband pulled a rickshaw, and the wife helped people wash clothes, barely living a life of not being able to eat enough to avoid starvation. Naturally, it was much better than being left to die after the flood in their hometown; however, they had heard the old man at the ferry tell stories about Shanghai: gold was paved on the ground, and as long as you had the ability, you could become a rich man from morning to evening, so they traveled thousands of miles to this big city. Now, after a full two years, they had recognized everything and understood everything. Who said this was not a paradise, but how could it not be a hell!</p>
<p>Their life was a life in hell!</p>
<p>Working like cattle and horses, who is made of iron? The husband fell ill, vomiting and diarrhea violently, which is a terminal illness for the poor, because their dictionary does not have the word "medicine."</p>
<p>The wife was so busy that she had not slept well for three days. With one less person making money and one more person eating, the family could not support it no matter what. So she washed clothes day and night, trying to do twice the work of her husband's legs from her wrists.</p>
<p>This is the fate of the poor, and they cannot blame heaven.</p>
<p>The husband knew that his wife was not a strong person, and he did not want to lie down again before he got up, so when he felt a little revitalized, he strenuously swung his legs to make a rickshaw-pulling posture, but it startled his wife on the ground. She rubbed her blurry eyelids and sat up from the ground, asking what the husband was doing.</p>
<p>He lifted his hairy legs and replied with a smile: "I have strength!"</p>
<p>"Rest for another day; I can go collect the money today."</p>
<p>"Isn't it good to earn a little more money when you have nothing to do? You also sleep comfortably for a while today." The husband drank a few more mouthfuls of cold tea and was ready to go out.</p>
<p>"Then come back earlier." She lay down weakly again, not seeing clearly that her husband's legs did not have the same strength as before.</p>
<p>Pulling the empty car slowly, the world seemed to have been separated from him for a long time. The sun had just risen from the east, and it no longer felt as comfortable on his body as it had before he went out, but he received a long-distance business, and he mustered up the courage to run forward.</p>
<p>When he arrived at his destination, beads of sweat the size of soybeans fell down. Panting, he sat on the foot of the car and could no longer stand up. He fell into a daze for more than an hour, and he pulled the empty car home like a snail.</p>
<p>In front of a factory gate, he was called to stop. Several people were helping a man with a drooping head and wanted him to pull him to the Red Cross. He told them that he couldn't pull it, and one person replied:</p>
<p>"Friend, pull him for a trip. If it's any later, I'm afraid he'll be dead." He pointed to the worker in the crook of his arm.</p>
<p>Like God's will, he stopped the car in front of them, helped the patient onto the car, and then ran forward, with several people following behind.</p>
<p>With a divine power, he pulled so fast, not like a person who had been vomiting and diarrhea for three days. A breath of air in his stomach was rising upward. The faster he pulled, the more comfortable he felt. In a few minutes, he arrived at the Red Cross.</p>
<p>He stopped the car, and the worker who had just spoken thanked him with four mao of money and helped the patient inside. He smiled and took the money, felt dizzy, fell to the ground, and white foam poured out of his mouth. His limbs were convulsing, and in less than two minutes, he died stiffly.</p>
<p>Four mao of money was dropped in the center of the street. This is the fate of the poor, and they cannot blame heaven.</p>
<h3>Tricked by the Ancients!</h3>

<h3>The New Autumn Countryside</h3>
<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>The cool autumn weather, with its high skies and crisp air, has unknowingly descended upon the world.</p>
<p>Autumn is such a lovely and endearing season! It does not have the unbearable heat of summer, the biting cold of winter, or the alternating cold and warmth and intermittent rain of spring, which make people feel uncomfortable and disgusted. Instead, it has cool breezes and bright moons, giving rise to a sense of beauty like that of a paradise.</p>
<p>When this autumn season, "when the weather is cool but not cold," arrives, the countryside, which has always been very tranquil, feels even more lovely in the evenings after the scorching sun has withdrawn its intense flames:</p>
<p>--The weather is so cool, the night sky is so clear and blue, and the gentle breeze blows through the green groves in bursts, emitting a lingering and desolate sound; the sound waves of chirping insects ripple through the woods from time to time, lingering in the ears; clusters of bright stars are deeply embedded in the blue sky and shine, emitting their only light, illuminating the earth; a crescent of thin, bright new moon hangs shyly in a corner of the western sky, as if inquiring about the secrets of the world. At this time, under the dense shade of willow trees and beside the still water of the pond, three or five farmers and farm women, who have been working hard all day, often gather to chat. Among them, the sounds of complaining, "It's hot! It's hot!..." are no longer heard, and the energetic waving of large palm-leaf fans is no longer seen. Moreover, some people who are not very healthy and cannot resist the invasion of the evening breeze have even put on a light jacket over their shoulders, which have been bare for many days.</p>
<p>In such a scene, if you walk out alone into the boundless wilderness, look up at the thin, bright moon and the twinkling stars in the sky; turn around and face the gentle evening breeze that is blowing slowly, letting it flutter your clothes, brush your skirts, and sweep over your long hair, blowing away all the vulgarity in your brain; you really don't know whether you are still living in this bustling world or have already stepped into a misty fairyland!</p>
<p>I love autumn, especially the secluded and gentle early autumn evenings. I wish it would stay in the world forever, allowing the filthy people to be intoxicated in its soft embrace like light smoke and flowing clouds!</p>
<h3>Evening</h3>
<p>— Yefei</p>
<p>I was alone, carrying a wounded heart, walking, walking on the path at dusk, heading towards my destination - home. The muddy road after the rain was strangely slippery. If I stepped on it, I would accidentally fall into the pond. The autumn insects in the field were mourning with hissing voices; the tone was so miserable. The faint barking of dogs swept past my ears, and a small village was reflected in front of me.</p>
<p>I groped my way home, pushed the door open, and saw that Li Jun was still doing needlework under the kerosene lamp, waiting for me, not sleeping. When she saw me, she looked me up and down with surprised eyes and said:</p>
<p>"Ping! Why are you in such a hurry today! You look very bad! Were you frightened?" As she spoke, she went to get a towel to wipe the cold sweat off me; I didn't answer her, and I felt extremely tired.</p>
<p>"Sigh! Ping! You're too tired! However, I can't share some of your strength. I'm always making you so tired. I'm really sorry for you..."</p>
<p>"Ah! What else is there to say? In order to eat and in order to live, I have to pinch my nose and suffer the turtle's anger! Li Jun! Did Aunt Quan come today? The things I discussed with her, there should be some progress, right?"</p>
<p>"She came once today. It looks like there's still some hope."</p>
<p>I dragged my wounded body, and the whip marks of physical life were aching faintly, aching deeply and thoroughly, but I didn't want her to see it; I forced myself to struggle to the door, but she hurried to catch up and supported me.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>"Ping! Do you want water to drink? There's some in the room!" At that time, I felt a heat in my heart, and my throat was itchy and strange. A fishy smell rushed up from my throat, followed by two coughs, and finally I vomited a large mouthful of fresh blood. She was so frightened and hurriedly helped me to bed and asked me:</p>
<p>"Ping! Ping! What... what's wrong... with you! Don't... don't scare... scare me to death."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she cried. This made me even more upset. I opened my eyes slightly and waved my hand:</p>
<p>"What are you crying for! I won't die just yet: Quick, I feel very uncomfortable, go get me a glass of salt water, the more salt, the better."</p>
<p>She got a glass of salt water and slowly poured it into me. After I finished drinking a glass of salt water, she asked me if I wanted any more. I just shook my head at her and said, "Li Jun! You go to sleep."</p>
<p>"Why did you suddenly have such a problem today? Did you get hurt from working too hard?"</p>
<p>As Li Jun spoke, she took off the dirty clothes on my body that were covered in mud: But, after taking off my clothes, she found red and purple blood marks on my skin, and some of them were oozing out of those strands of fresh blood!</p>
<p>"Oh! What's this! Ping! Who beat you? It's so heartbreaking! Alas!" I looked at her and smiled miserably: "I need to eat! What can I do? Li Jun."</p>
<p>She stroked my wounds and cried on my body, crying sadly and sorrowfully.</p>
<p>An atmosphere of fear and misery filled the entire room.</p>
<p>"Ping! Your body is like this, I'll ask for a leave for you tomorrow, so you can rest for a few days!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but for poor people like us who eat one day at a time, how can we not work for a day? If we don't work for a day, we won't have food to eat for a day. Now, I can still struggle a little, so I have to go and struggle, unless my eyes are completely closed. Vomiting blood! It's not just one day, to tell you the truth,"</p>
<p>Both of them were silent. The night, the deep night, went deeper and deeper, and the air in this room also went as deep as the night.</p>

<h3>Brother and Sister-in-law's Abuse</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I have a question about my future and am now especially beseeching you, Mr. Editor, to sacrifice some of your precious time to give me guidance.</p>
<p>I am a lonely and weak woman. My parents had three children: my elder brother, my elder sister, and me. My elder brother is married to his wife, and my elder sister is also married. I am the youngest, currently twenty-one years old. Two years ago, my parents passed away, leaving behind an inheritance of several tens of thousands of dollars, which is entirely managed by my brother and sister-in-law. From then on, I have been in a bitter situation. Alas, I am often abused by them at home, treated like a slave. It is truly beyond the power of words to describe.</p>
<p>I graduated from elementary school in the past. Later, because of serving my parents, I stopped studying for several years. I usually studied on my own. This spring, when various schools were holding entrance examinations, I was determined to seek specialized knowledge. As a result, I was admitted to a specialized school. So, I asked them for tuition fees, but I was immediately refused. I didn't get a single cent. Later, relatives tried to persuade them without success. Unable to think of a solution, I had to borrow money from various relatives to be able to enter school. Time flies like an arrow, and one semester has passed. For the tuition fees for the second semester, my relatives are no longer lending me money. I foresee that I will drop out of school again. Now I raise a few points: (1) In such a family situation, should my brother be responsible for providing my tuition fees? (2) If he is not responsible, what should I do? (3) Do women have inheritance rights? (4) How should the inheritance be divided between married and unmarried women? Regarding the above questions, please, Mr. Editor, provide me with detailed instructions in the shortest possible time. I am immensely grateful. Best wishes.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Someone.</p>
<p>Answer: It is indeed an unfortunate thing that you are suffering from the pain inflicted by your brother and sister-in-law. Because among ordinary families, siblings usually have some affection for each other. It is unexpected that your brother and sister-in-law not only do not support your education but also often abuse you, abusing you like a slave. It is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>However, before answering your questions, there is one point you must pay attention to, which is whether you ultimately have the courage and determination. Because if you do not have the courage and determination, then no matter how much effort is made to answer you, it will be of no avail. Therefore, the most important thing is to see if you yourself can have the courage to do it.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the laws of the Republic of China, men and women have equal status. Therefore, in the inheritance of property, there is no distinction between importance. Completely according to Article 1141 of the Civil Code, which stipulates that "When there are several heirs of the same order, the inheritance shall be divided equally according to the number of people." In the editor's view, there is no room for compromise between you and your brother and sister-in-law, because they not only abuse you, but even the persuasion of relatives is ineffective. It is conceivable that they are unreasonable. Since your parents had tens of thousands of dollars in inheritance, you can contact your married elder sister to jointly request your brother to divide the inheritance into three parts, because according to Article 1 of the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Married Women's Retrospective Inheritance of Property."</p>
