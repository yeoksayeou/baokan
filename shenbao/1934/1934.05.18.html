<h3 id="c26">論蘇俄加入國聯 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>本屆國聯行政院開會。重新申明不承認僞滿之原則。而立國於資本主義組織體系以外以蘇聯。亦聞有實行加盟之議。此兩事對於遠東大局。皆直接有關。而後者之影響。尤爲重大。是以足資吾人之注意。</p>
<p>蘇聯在托拉茨基派掌握大權之時。以完成世界革命爲已任。其進取方針。大别爲二一則西出歐陸在人心極度惶恐之德意志。掀動革命。一則東向亞洲。以打倒帝國主義爲口號。引起鬥爭。迨托派失勢史丹林派代興。鑒於西歐時勢變易。東亞荆棘孔多。不能不暫置世界革命於第二義。而先圖本國之富强。其歷年所標榜之親鄰外交。動機在此。然蘇聯在歐洲方面與其貼隣各小國。雖皆成立互不侵犯條約。用作平時之屏蔽固有餘裕苟遇戰事發生。若芬蘭立陶宛等小國。自保能力均極薄弱。僅憑區區數紙不侵犯條約之保障。殊嫌不足。故不能不交歡法蘭西。拉攏意大利。以爲未雨綢繆之計。</p>
<p>蘇聯在西歐方面之最大假想敵。厥爲德國。蓋德國國德社黨執政後。公然高張反赤之旗幟。復在與蘇聯接壤之波羅的海畔各小國。肆意活動。希脫拉氏雖與波蘭訂給互不侵犯條約。而『　廊』問題。仍充滿嚴重之危機。一旦波蘭告急。蘇聯又焉能高枕而臥。德國爲軍備平等問題而脫離國聯。設非有强力改造現狀之凖備與决心。必不至此。若國聯之組織宣告解體。則戰禍之爆發。更將加速。在蘇聯内部布置尙未完全就緒之前。固不願捲入漩渦。然而大勢所趨。豈容袖手旁觀。則爲蘇聯利害着想。加入國聯行政院。以增高其國際地位。而重張警戒德國之聲勢。固計之得者也。</p>
<p>不寗惟是。遠東形勢之危急。日甚一日。所謂日本大陸政策第二步之實行。固將於蘇聯之利益。發生嚴重衝突蘇聯乃不能不從事於適當之應付。如增加遠東軍團之餉項給養。特免東部西比利亞之捐稅·。皆其備戰之步驟。顧僅此而止。仍未足以策萬全。外交手段之運用旣爲彼邦所優爲。苟有利於已。自不肯失之交臂『九一八』事變後。國聯與蘇聯對於遠東問題之觀察。雖非完全一致。而其反日之立塲則固無稍殊。雙方因此立塲而互相結合。又非不可能也。</p>
<p>所難者。蘇聯必不願無條件加盟。而其加盟條。又聞不易爲若干國聯會員國所接受。報章記載莫斯科所傳參加國聯之條件甚多。其尤重要者。爲（一）國聯各會員國須一致承認蘇俄政府。（二）各會員國須與蘇俄訂立互不侵犯條約。（三）要求人種平等權。瑞士不允承認蘇俄。已爲世人所周知。國聯所在地。旣爲瑞士國土。則瑞士之阻力。似亦不可漠視。至若互不侵犯條約之訂。結。人種平等權之要求。有關於歐洲全局及少數民族問題。一時皆難實現。故依吾人觀察。蘇聯加盟之舉。在國聯九月大會以前。殆不至有具體化之可能也。</p>

<p>顧假定對於通車通郵、吾堅不承認、則華北不其危乎、曰、唯唯否否、蓋日本之對於華北、必出於擾亂、固不可免、然依其計劃與一定之步驟及對各國所採取之策略、必無立卽調大軍進佔華北之事、使日本苟以現在佔領華北爲有利、則根本卽無塘沽恊定、而塘沽恊定、非日本處於被動、爲吾外交折衝之成功、乃日本權衡利害、稍緩進攻之對華政策使然、豈吾求和乞憐屏息聽命之外交所能轉其凶鋒者、彼自以塘沽恊定爲華北轉危爲安之符者、是其不知恥辱、與吾人之在東北偸生苟活、眞堪魯衛矣、進一步言之、吾不承諾其通車通郵、彼卽進佔華北、吾亦惟有盡力抵抗、抵抗不過、寗使其如吾東北之强佔、亦不當由吾承認失却外交立塲、斷絶收復機緣、而予各國以瓜分之口實也、矧就其對華政策觀之、此時尙無積極進佔華北之决心、吾父老正宜乘此機會、謀所以凖備抵抗之道、不可因其將至、而心懷恐懼、坐以待斃、亦不可因其未卽至、而心存怠忽、毫不爲備、九一八事變、吾東北四省軍民上下、正坐此病、此吾人今日所以含垢蒙羞不避險阻、將意入關、向我全國父老一陳其愚者也、</p>
<p>吾父老苟不以人廢言、更哀其意急作凖備、默中組織、亡羊補牢、實不爲晚、十年前之義大利·蘇俄·德意志·等國、其環境之惡劣、數倍於吾國之今日、惟以彼能團結奮鬭、故不僅脫離困厄、一躍而反爲世所尊仰、吾父老苟能放棄個人主義之成見、暫取一致對外之態度、天助自助者、必獲勝利、吾人亦非徒以望之父老、而自甘奴辱、若此亦自不向父老爲此痛心之言、如謂吾人何以不急起奮鬭、或悉行入關、以示不屈、是則爲刻責矣、蓋吾人旣愧九一八前未能先事凖備有所組織、迨禍變已發、倉卒應付、自無能濟事、然而不屈之精神、固已由義勇軍三字大白於天下、今而後欲謀東北問題之解决、殊非吾人單獨之力、所可勝任、必全國共具决心、實行整個團結、一致動作、俟一相當機會、庶可一舉而得恢復、至吾人之不能悉數入關者、乃事實上之不許、非吾人之不欲也、</p>
<p>夫以吾東北知識分子、或有相當地位者、區區少數人之入關、國家尙無法安排、致有爲生活所迫、去而復返、被日本人加以重侮辱者、此爲吾人在東北所最痛心最失望之事、吾人微論安土重遷、老弱扶持、不易爲清野之謀、假令實行、則三千六百萬人民之安排、國家有此辦法否乎、設如此則讓其地爲日鮮農民所居、固日本之所大欲也、以故吾人爲生活所迫、而留居東北、或有服務所謂滿洲國者、固不必盡目之爲漢奸爲附逆、大都多懷得當以報漢者、此不可不察也、且最低限度、國家亦勿爲叢而驅雀、故凡現在寄居關内之東北人士、爲吾人父兄者有之、爲吾人子弟者有之、茫茫若喪家之犬、吾國家與華北父老宜哀矜而撫卹之、勿以其失省亡家而加以輕視排擠、使其有受内外夾攻之感、是尤吾人所重託於全國父老之前者、嗚呼、父老、一關之隔、咫尺天涯、舉首中原、無涕可揮、異日見有持靑天白日旗荷戈之鬭士、來相握手、當知吾父老努力功成也、</p>

<p>據孔氏談、本人此次赴皖贛鄂湘等省、視察各省財政狀　　况、當過皖時、因步履不愼傷足、抵贛後卽晋晤蔣委員長、關於剿匪事宜、以及全國經濟委員會各問題、均經詳談、並商討邀集經委會衛生公路等五專家、會談今後工作進行事宜、抵漢後、曾與張漢卿氏晤面、並視察鄂省財政收支狀况、旋應湖南省何主席之邀、乘坐飛機、赴湘會晤、小作勾留、卽返漢、繼乘坐海關海星巡艦、偕同美國白銀專家羅傑士回京在歸程申、曾與羅氏在輪中交換關於白銀意見甚詳、此行視察結果、雖僅及皖贛鄂湘四省、但認該四省財政狀况、均較前大有進步、至於該四省收支現狀、鄂湘均能收支相等、皖省因保衛團經費關係、稍感短少、贛則處於特殊之環境、當然收支不敷、</p>

<p>至於整頓各省財政、孔氏認此問題範圍甚大、非數語所能解决、惟一言以蔽之、欲整頓各省財政、首當明瞭各省財政情形、各省財政之急待整頓、並無可諱言、卽中央財政、亦急待整頓也、整頓之策、亦當視各省環境而定、例如鄂省田賦之徵收、不以畝計、而以每田下種之榖量計、而下種榖量、亦無可靠調查、此種情形、非立加改革不可、關於此問題、將於本月廿一日開幕之全國財政會議中討論之、孔氏本人、亦决於會前入京主持、各省市財政當局、已紛紛赴京出席、</p>

<p>連日說明了『同一性』『統一性』的内容，今日進而解說盛君提出的『二』『三』兩問題。編者</p>
<p>二『對立的同一性是相對的，對立的鬥爭是絶對的』</p>
<p>這是辯證法的認識論，最重要，最基本的部份。辯證唯物論者的一大集　中，有不少理論家們，實行家們，因爲對於這個基本部份的認識錯誤，或了解不足，陷於和辯證法格鬥面不自知的情况。譬如波格達諾夫，德波林，盧波爾，及布哈林等。以考次基爲首的，第二國際的一般理論家們，也是把對产的同一看作絶對，看作永久的和諧。而抹殺了對立的鬥爭之絶對性，而成爲革命的叛徒的。從此我人卽可知道一原則的重要了。</p>
<p>那麽『對立的同一性是相對的』這名話怎樣解呢？仍然拿前面所用過的例子來說罷。黃牛與水牛是對立的兩隻物體，牠們有一致的地方，皆有角，皆吃草，皆反蒭，皆能耕田及挽車，這卽呌做對立的同一性。但這種同一性不是絶對的，就是說黃牛不完全等於水牛。因其皮毛色澤性格有種種差别，故是相對的。（有條件的）他如馬騾等一切自然物，都莫不如此。從自然科學的發達後，愈益證明這種原理之正確。譬如水受日光的蒸晒，化作氣體成爲雲。雲遇冷則變爲雨而復原爲水。又如算學上的正數和負數，微分和積分。天文與地理，物理和化學，一切皆有共同性，但都不是絶對的。這是自然科學來講的例子。</p>
<p>如以社會的政治經濟的科學來講，讀者將兪明瞭。如法蘭西大革命，那時的資產階級和無產階級，及農民小資產階級，共同反對地主封建貴族的專制政體，要求民主共和。這是說明各個對立階級在反地主封建貴族的民主革命中，其利害是同一，而這個對立階級丨主要是資產階級和無產階級！的同一，僅僅在反對建專制的（條件的）革命中暫時的同一，不是永遠的同一，絶對的同一。『巴黎公社』的失敗，工農的大流血，『甲可賓』的等政體，正是說明這一原理的具體是事實卽前說一九一七年俄國二月革命中工農與資產階級的例子，也是說明『對立的鬥爭是絶對的。』祇要我們略略留心社會現象，隨時隨地都可以找着極適當的例證來。</p>
<p>總之永久不變的東西，是没有的。如水變爲雲，木頭竹幹變爲紙張，鷄蛋孵化爲雛，種子而萌芽而生枝發葉，而開花結實復變爲種子，隨時隨地，由一種形態變爲他種形態；這種變化過程，轉變爲其自身的對立物。任何過程的留停性，是相對的。但是一種過程轉化爲他種過程是絶對的。故說『對立的同一！凝結，和合，均勢！是有條件的，一時的，暫存的，相對的。互相排拒的對立的鬥爭，是絶對的。正和發展運動是絶對的一樣。』</p>
<p>人們祗有把握着這種正確的認識法則，纔能抓住一切存在物的自運動的鑰匙；祇有他能彀給予理解變化，發展，突變，漸進中斷，轉爲對立；舊的絶減與新的生長之關鍵。不然，就會把世界看作靜的死的，毫無生趣的東西。（三）『人類的認識是當作一個動因被包含在多方面的社會的實踐之中的能動過程。』</p>
<p>如前所說，自然，社會，思維，形式及槪念，是分立的統一，統一的分裂；都離不了矛盾，變化，發展，舊減和新生的法則，因此人類的認識，也就不是靜的，死的，而是活潑生動的。</p>
<p>隨着自然科學的發明與發達，人類對於自然現象的識就有大大的進步，達爾文的進化論没有發明之前，以爲人類是上帝創造的。其後，人類對於人類的認識，就否定了上帝創造的神宰作用，肯定爲與其他生物一樣，乃由别的動物轉化脫胎而來，卽是從猿猴轉化的。哥侖布的航海成功，發現舊世界之外，尙有一個新世界丨美洲。麥哲侖周游航海成功，發現了地球是圓的，而否定了地球是方的認識。天文學的發明，各種天文儀器的製造成功，否定了八大行星的認識而爲九大行星，人們以爲神奇的月蝕日蝕，因天文學的發達，也變爲無足驚異了。電子的發明，給予原子爲最高程式的否定，機器的發明，消滅了乎工業的作坊。火犁收獲機的發明，就產生了新式的大農坊。</p>
<p>十八世紀末，葉及十九世紀中葉，歷史學社會科學的發展，確定社會必然變革的學說。原始共產社會變革爲氏族社會；氏族社會變爲封建社會；封建社會變爲資本主義社會，資本主義社會也必沉落，再變革爲另一種社會（社會主義的社會）其間的變革過程或快或緩或形式的不同，而變革的認識是肯定的。</p>
<p>當歐洲資本主義勢力侵入中國的時候，動搖了南中國各省丨尤以廣東，福建，浙江，江蘇等沿海諸省的農村經濟，英國機織布打碎了南京的大布，廣州的土布；同樣打碎了農村家庭婦女的紡織業。開始時人們祇以爲紅毛人不好，和中國人搶飯吃，外國機器不好，搶了他乎工業的工作。故有廣州三元井的農民，（是廣州市郊的一個農村，以紡織爲全村經濟生活，人口有三萬餘人）成羣結隊到廣州示感，並打壞外國的商行住宅，及破碎其機器。卽初成的滬淞鐵路之被拆毁，也和三元井的農民暴動有同樣仇外厭惡機器的意義。這種事業，當英國機器工業逐漸發達時，也有過農民和手工業破壞機器的暴動例子，以後事實的發展，才給人們認識這不是中國人和外國人，機器和手工的問題，乃是資本主義的發展的行程，及雅片戰爭，中日戰爭，以至於義和團事件，一直發展到『五卅』運動，打倒帝國主義的口號，才被人們認識。</p>
<p>因爲現實的變化，發展着，我人對於現實的認識，也隨着一同變化。從以上的說明中，就可瞭然。但是，我人不要以這種認識，乃如鏡子之反照人面一樣，毫無差别條件的撮映出來，譬如（反帝）。並不是因爲我們已經有了反帝的事實，才反映『反帝』的口號。而是由於帝國主義侵略的加緊，民族危機的深入，把『反帝』的口號當作實踐上（運動上）可以解放中國民族的戰鬥的旗幟。又如『抗日』，並不是有了義勇軍的活動，淞滬的抗戰，纔反映出抗日的認識。而是由『九一八』事件之後，日本帝國主義步步進迫，從實踐中認識爲抗日是解救目前最急迫的危機之任務，如果把認識當作變動的反映，那末『反帝』『抗日』的口號，祇是一種無靈魂的死的標語。五卅運動不過是中國反帝運動成爲意識的運動的起點，因爲提出反帝口號來，在實踐運動上，而普遍了反帝運動。這就是極明白的例子。讀者欲求得澈底明瞭必須自已從實踐生活中去找例證，本書第二章中，也有原則的說明，讀者多讀幾回，定可得相當了解。（未完）</p>

<p>（電通十七日馬尼刺電）高欄豫賽、在Ｂ組發表入選第三之安達清（日）、因倒欄三個失格、頃發表以第四之清水孝太郎（日）入選、清水選手與第一之加西亞（菲）、並肩越過最後之欄、因脚滑轉跌、致落第四、頗期待其在决賽之活躍云、</p>

<p>本月八日、我國選乎乘大來公司麥金蘭總統船到岷、幾乎震動岷埠全體華僑社會、故其歡迎情形、大有可記價值、</p>
<p>（一）招待委員籌備忙碌</p>
<p>凡社會機關、欲以摩託車加入歡迎會者、委員會預製紙牌數百張、並小國旗數百面、各車可領紙牌二張、小國旗二面、故前天專派二人分給旗與牌、甚形忙碌、</p>
<p>（二）麥金蘭總統輪遲到</p>
<p>麥金蘭總統船、遲至九黠五十分始行到埠、中華商會主席、及幹事劉雪松、先乘海關小輪出堤埠外登船歡迎、計是日華僑各社團及個人自備汽車往碼頭者、有二百餘輛、王氏家族自治會太原堂、備汽車一十輛、又菲律賓體育恊會、備大小汽車二十輛、專載諸選手、爲盡地主之誼、至八點以後、華僑男女自動加入者、數近萬人、七號之大碼頭、擠得幾乎不洩不通、迨船依碼頭時菲體育恊會所預備軍樂二隊、及中國童子軍二三六團軍樂隊、齊奏歡迎歌、一時拍掌聲、有同雷響也、</p>

<p>奪得全國女游泳錦標楊秀瓊女士、其芳名幾華僑婦孺皆知、故下船時、大受觀衆包圍、卽菲人</p>
<p>亦　爲具有　美身材、誠不愧爲東方美人魚、據楊女士與各記者談話、謂到菲律　爲第一次、　覺此地天氣炎熱、比華南尤甚又球怪李惠堂征菲之役、獲爲七八度矣、在僑界中或有不知王正廷者、但幾無人不識李惠堂、故欲一瞻　采者、亦幾望眼爲穿、幸李君精神健壯猶昔、故一設體育家猶爲我國足球前途慶、據李君言、此番戴麟經諸健將、末能聯袂偕來、在實力上雖不免有缺陷、但足球隊中諸選乎、以華南爲中心、其對於聯絡上必益能應付裕如、故足球之操勝算大有把握也、</p>
<p>（五）王氏與各記者談話話</p>
<p>大槪一要人到時、各報記者、視爲無上絶好資料、遂不免羣向包圍、大發其談話、况祖國日來惡耗、僑界更欲知確切之消息、王氏又爲十餘年來出色之外交家、故其談話、更爲足重者、茲錄其最要之問答如左、</p>
<p>（問）此次日本欲强拉其一乎製造之僞滿加入遠運會爲我方反對、日方礙於會章、忍痛照舊參加、本届遠運會、决在遠東運動會常會提議修改會章、以三分之、一多數票、實行修改、而常會會期、又適在遠運會期内、設日方達到目的、我方將如何對付、立卽退出比賽乎、盡『歡』而散乎、（答）我國對於日人强拉僞滿參加始終反對、···抑吾人亦從未贊成、當日代表山本忠興到滬時、曾以此爲請、被予一言駁倒、予問山本、何處是滿洲國、予誠不知何處是滿洲國、敎予如何投票、譬如說鄭先生、予應先知鄭先生何處人、何日生、然後可以談判鄭先生事、此理至明、固母庸曉曉也、（問）華菲關係密切、而菲島行將獨立、聞王先生此次來菲、除率領中華選乎參加遠運及出席遠運常會外、尙負有其他使命、如與菲當局會商通商等外交事件然否、（答）華菲關係誠密切、然菲島獨立實現、至少尙須十五年、在此時而談通商、或其他外交事件、似嫌太早、續云、此次不過凖備凖備、予與菲參議長奎松爲多年老友、心心相印、可以互談一切、惟係以私人友誼討論、並非正式談判、（問）奎松返岷過滬時、博士設筵招待、曾與會談何種問題否、（答）未曾談論何種問題、不過招待而已、（問）駐華日使有吉明近到南京與汪精衛·黃郛·會談中日事件、其後又偕往上海會商後、日使卽返日報告、是否對華北通車已有把握、（答）此事不大清楚、（問）日人謂塘沽恊定、規定華北與僞國通車然否、（答）絶無此事（問）塘沽恊定、博士見過否（答）見過、（問）然則内容如何、（答）與報章所載者同、（問）日本發對華政策新宣言後、引起歐美諸國之反響、國府曾發兩次宣言反對、此事是否就此結束、（答）可做之事尙多、要在如何做法耳、予意汪精衛爲黨國要人、必不肯喪失中國主權、吾人應與合作、俾得專心爲國効力、卽蔣先生亦非喪權辱國之人、（問）聞汪精衛近曾請博士入京、將請博士重任外交部長、確有此事否、（答）没有此事、（問）博士近曾赴北平、聞該處情形甚險惡、然否、（答）無所謂險惡不險惡、中國情形險惡、豈僅華北一處、華南豈不一樣、設日人以二三萬重兵、在廣東登岸、吾人能禦之乎、談至此各記者見王氏頻頻咳嗽、狀甚疲倦、不欲多擾、乃與辭而歸、</p>

<p>第十届遠東運動會昨爲第六日、奈天公不美、大雨竟日不止、一切競技、均告停頓、至使田徑游泳等、不能如期結束、大會遂不得不展延一日、各種錦標、雖未至結束時期、然形勢規定、端倪已具、爲述槪况如下、</p>
<h3 id="c225">足球 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>自上届我國與日本戰三比三和局、平分錦標後、人氣大爲憤慨、本届有非勝不可之勢、初戰菲律賓、以二比零勝、甚覺吃力、以爲對新加入之勁旅荷印比賽、未許樂觀、咸抱着懷疑態度、而當此懷疑時期中、荷印竟以七比一大敗日本、以爲荷印替我國報仇、大快人大、一方面則又今人大爲惶恐、蓋如此比數、卽我國對之、亦覺凶多吉少、詎料我軍第二次出塲、亦以二比零勝荷印、於是化恐懼爲樂觀、平庸之日本、諒非我軍敵手矣、然日菲之戰、菲雖在上半時中以三比一領前、但下半時反被日本攻入三球、局勢一變、菲軍仍敗、日軍之長力及奮鬥精神、不容輕視、我軍猶不能高枕無憂、我人祗望戰一和局、則錦標亦歸我得矣、</p>
<h3 id="c226">籃球 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>我國對於籃球隊之希望、原不雄厚、證之上届兩敗於日、及日本亦曾擊敗菲島一次之成結而論、當然此番得勝之希望更微、球隊出國前以輿論之激勵、使之球員意識中、非一雪前恥不可、果然初次出馬、以四十二比二十六大敗日本、接後菲軍亦以五十一比三十五戰勝矮軍、觀此比數、使我軍之希望驟增、中菲初戰之期旣到、國内熱心人士、無不屏息以待、待電訊到滬、上半時我軍以十二比二十六之大差、敗於菲軍、下半時因大雨不止、我方要求停賽、裁判員竟不允、反判我隊棄權、裁判員之無利壓迫忍無可忍、我方乃提出抗議、經競賽會之議决、决推翻裁判之判决、定二十日重賽、但視中日第二次比賽之情形、我軍幸賴王玉增最後十秒鐘之一擲、以四十八比四十七再勝日本、誠不無餘悖、要無王君之一球、豈非以四十六比四十七敗於日軍乎、觀此、雖勝日本而雪前恥、但菲律賓視爲禁臠之籃球錦標、恐猶非我國份内事、</p>
<h3 id="c227">排球 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>咸以爲最有把握可以蟬聯錦標之排球、安知非特被菲擊敗、反爲日本吃　、開我國排球在遠運史上的空前慘敗、駭人聽聞、令人氣短、菲律賓先以三比一勝日、而我國則以三比二勝日、以此以數推測、我國惟菲島之敵也宜矣、然又安知以直落三之敗於菲耶、又豈料中日第二次賽、竟被日以三比一報復耶、日菲第二次賽、菲又以三比一勝、於是菲隊已三戰三勝、最後一塲對我國、不論勝負如何、錦標已成菲隊之囊中物矣、</p>
<h3 id="c228">網球 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>我國網球之敗、爲必然的形勢、事前我人預料以爲可望繼第八届大會再得錦標者、大過是神經過敏自信過甚的意想而已、要知中日網球程度、相差甚遠、彼之第一二流選手、雖赴歐洲出席台杯及其他國際比賽然彼之第三四流選手、已足勝我國之第一流人材而有餘、日本若不以預備員戎肇調山田出塲、許承甚又安能爭得一綫之光榮、第八届遠運在滬敗於我國林寳華邱飛海之佐藤俵、今番重遇邱君事前佐藤頗懼邱飛海、待開始交鋒、佐藤大爲失望不意邱之技術如此惡化、七年後之邱飛海、依然故我也、佐藤之失望、實笑我國選手之太不景氣耳、我人實無以自慰、至於日菲决賽之形勢、日本佐藤又全勝兩單打、卽使山田全敗、雙打日本必勝、錦標爲日本穩得、</p>
<h3 id="c229">棒球 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>我國之棒球、原係敷衍塲面而已、但求有良好表演、於願已足、菲律賓此番以向來認爲職業的聯賽中球員、恢復業餘而參加實力突增、並鑒於前兩届之連敗於我國、（我國由檀香山華僑代表）退落第三、誓必雪恥、若以本届菲隊實力而論、確有奪標之可能、日本對之、亦瞠乎其後、我國對菲之第一戰、菲以廿五比一勝、菲得安打十五次、我國亦得七次、但錯誤竟至九次之多、表演未必佳妙、第二戰我國對日、僅發覺三次錯誤、而以一比二十敗、日菲初賽、日竟零敗、菲投手之怪技、促成日隊之打擊完全失敗、九局中日本得逹二壘之機會、亦僅三四次耳、可見菲隊之强、日本决難蟬聯錦標、中菲二次賽、菲以二等角色出塲、我以十四比零再敗、日菲二賽、日本恐仍須大敗、</p>
<h3 id="c230">田徑 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>田徑賽我國已有特殊進步、然與日菲比較、猶在百步與十步之間、若能得分、已償所願、但衆望所歸認爲最有希望之劉長春、兩項短跑、竟均於預賽中跑第四落選、查劉君幾次來滬、從未獻其身手、卽如此番我國田徑預選也、中西對抗也、均不輕易出塲、劉君自言腿傷、豈其腿之永久不得痊愈耶、國人感以爲其養精蓄銳、凖備遠運、爲國增光、而今如此下塲、可謂劉君畢身之大憾、無怪乎我國徑賽之不能得分矣、田賽中吳必顯之跳高一米八三攫得第四、誠大出冷門、旣非國人所料、在吳君本人、亦當引爲意外之光榮、其他項目、如陳寳球之鉛球、僅九牛一毛之希望、符保盧之撑竿跳、如能獲得一分、亦屬幸事矣、</p>
<h3 id="c231">全能 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>我國穩得兩項接力之第三名、蓋荷印雖有五項十項選手、但無接力隊也、王季淮之五項、張齡佳之十項、或可有一綫希望</p>
<h3 id="c232">游泳 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>游泳爲日本之專產、菲律賓雖有二三特殊人材、决難動搖其寳產、我國選手、相去太遠、全軍覆没、意中事也、惟接力游亦算分數、我國穩居殿軍（第三）、亦可得到四分、女子游泳因日本女子之不參加、我國女子、遂得大出風頭、爲我男子爭光</p>

<p>（六）汪先生說『文言一字傳神、白話則往往數十語不能達意、雖學文言較費力、而以後受用、必且倍蓗』、敎育固當注意結果、但也應顧到過程、』十年窗下、僅乃通文』、此十年之工夫、豈能不算在經濟的賬内、况且寫文言文、十九不通、做白話文、隨意可造、這也是事實、在科舉時代、所謂童生專習文言的、十年窗下、到底有幾個人是通順的、以江陰論、『督學』所駐、考生綦多、千人投考、通順的實在不過百人、讀文言的結果、這也可想而知了、汪先生做過中學校長、中學一定注重文言的、試問高中畢業生能够以文言一字傳神得文言的受用的、十人之中、究有幾人、過程旣很困難、結果又不易佳、何論受用與否、</p>

<p>總之、汪先生的主張、還似乎脚踏在敎育界上、雖稍偏而仍舊不失爲一家之言、汪先生的指斥語體文、則似乎越出敎育界以外、不特有自相矛盾之處、且好像爲『偏舊之士』張目、敎育界以外『偏舊之士』的攻擊、本不足畏、獨敎育界自身的内訌、則誠可畏之至、以名宿如汪先生、在敎育界素負盛名、而竟發爲此言、『偏舊之士』拿到了必更振振有辭、以相反對、李斯執苟卿之說以成秦始皇的倒行逆施、那麽焚書之禍、非啓自白話文、實啓自汪先生說了、在汪先生豈願負此責任我久不發表意見了、實在也没有工夫發表、因爲重視汪先生之說、不覺斷斷爭之、修辭不當之處、未及訂正、萬請汪先生原諒、並請全國敎育界諸君指敎、（完）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>雖然，嚴格的講起來，這一次隨太后上奉天去的一班隨駕大臣之中，除掉勛齡和慶善兩人，眞够得上算是大臣之外，其餘的一班人，倘若不客氣一些，儘可不必把大臣的頭銜送給他們；但是我以爲極應該也稱他們爲隨駕大臣，否則便是不公允。因爲我覺得他們這一羣人所擔任的職務，簡直完全是一樣的，除非在朝見太后的時候，　善和勛齡所站的位置，總是在最先，此外便並無什麽區别了。說到站的位置，我們就不得不稱頌一聲爵位的可貴了。前面我雖然已經再三的說，爵位是一種虚名，絶無絲毫實益的，可是在朝見太后的時候，我二哥畢竟靠着他這個公爵的頭銜，每次總是站在慶善的前面，就是站得和太后格外近一些；這種待遇，在那時候算是一種極光榮的事情。慶善是清宮中的一個男管家，凡一個男管家所能管的事情，他大槪也可以完全管得到；而我二哥却是等於太后的一個侍從副官，雖然没有實權，地位却總比一個男管家來得高，因此他就可以站在慶善的前面了。</p>
<p>一路上，我們的列車往往因爲太后一時的高興，便命令他停止下來；而每當車子停的時候，慶善和勛齡所率領着的一批『隨駕大臣』，便得一齊走到太后跟前來侍候。太后對於這些人的名字，官銜，和他們個人的短短的歷史，差不多没有一個不知道。雖然他們侍立在伊面前的時候，伊對他們似乎並不怎樣注意，可是這些人的服裝和舉止，却没有半些能够逃出伊的靈敏的視綫以外去的。</p>
<p>『他們都是打扮得很富麗的丨』伊常是這樣的感慨着。『他們的浮華，他們的官架子，在旅途中，的確可以增加我們不少的風趣』！（三六）</p>

<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>年年看清明會，總見四個劊子手，頭上插着雉尾兩條，身穿紅緞的褂袴，那些人都是白白胖胖的大肚皮，雄糾糾在路上走着；據說；他們是肉莊裹的老閭，從小殺猪出身，所以個個是著名的屠夫！</p>
<p>吾說大肚皮，不一定去做劊子手，我常常看見，坐在汽車上，他的身體仰着，那肚皮像煞弓背罩着，成了一個極度的弧形，這不是文縐縐說起來，就呌做大腹賈麽？若念過書的，都曉得以前王羲之大肚皮，在東牀上袒着腹，且可得着美女，做了快壻，何等漂亮；就是蘇東坡大肚皮，它每當吃了飯，要徐徐的行動，有一天們着腹，問侍女道；『此中何有，』或對道；『文章經濟，』獨其妾朝雲搶白說；『學士一肚皮不合時宜，』坡只得捧腹大笑，這是何等的韻事丨不但這兩人，黨太尉吃飽後，也指其腹道；『我不負汝，左右曰，『將軍不負腹，此腹負將軍，並未少出智謀，』而邊孝先嘗要白天裹晝臥，那弟子嘲他道；『邊孝先腹便便，懶讀書，但欲眠，』孝先答道：『邊爲姓，孝爲字，腹便便，五經笥，』這兩位，覺得不但肚皮大，而器量也非常的大，這是不可及處！</p>
<p>前人說：宰相肚裹好撑船，也就是形容他的寛大爲懷，所以能爕理陰陽，治國安民，若照現在講：那肚皮過小，實在一物不可容，而内中的疙𤺥反多，倒使人莫測，弄得大家爾虞我詐，没有一人不是橫生意見，鬧出亂子來；其他呢？肚皮是大了，哼！不是吃飽金花菜，也就是身懷六甲，私底下害了十月病，還萬不及在路上大踏步的劊子手，來得堂而皇之啊！</p>

<p>鄕間眞是寂寞呀！『日出而作，日入而息』的哥兒，除了偸着一些農作之暇到小茶館裹坐坐，别的實在没有去處。</p>
<p>小茶館有甚麽好玩？一烟矮矮的平房，擺着幾張破桌，圍着幾條長凳；紫泥的茶壼，粗劣的磁碗，决没有雨前，烏龍等上好茶葉泡出來。可是早上，黃昏，簇擁着一屋子的人，滿座子談話的聲浪，香烟的氣味，也暫時變換一下鄕間沉寂的空氣。</p>
<p>年老的爹兒們，口中啣着烟管，緊蹙了額上的皺紋，從那枯燥的喉嚨裹，發出那『歌頌已往，感嘆未來』的語調。中年的叔伯們，探聽米價的貴賤，菜價的漲落，正像投機家做『買空』『賣空』般一樣的關心。少年的哥兒們，抽着烟捲，喝着釅茶，一壁在談着上海的風景。丨丨上海的女人是怎樣？上海的賭錢，酒菜，戲劇····等是怎樣？丨丨他們恨不得立刻刻插翅兒飛到上海來，嘗試那上海的繁華生活。</p>
<p>茶館裹的老關，一壁『呼呀！拍呀！』的抽着風箱，搧旺那茶爐；一壁在開講着『東村李嬸子，好軋野漢，昨晚給丈夫雙雙揪住了。西巷的王阿毛，喝醉了燒刀，在墳頭上睡了一夜，今天大發寒熱，怕是被野鬼迷住了。』他是鄕村裹一架，『無綫電機』；也可以稱他做『没字的新聞紙，』所以有許多人跑到這裹來，獨愛聽他的新聞。</p>

<p>第二十八回　巧合共觀塲疾情拾帕殷勤兩問疾誤會投書</p>
<p>桂枝，我現在忽然明白了，黃金時代的機會，雖然，是已經錯過去了，但是只要彼此明白，在精神上還不難彼此互相安慰吧？好了，只能寫到這裹爲止了。因爲我寫這封信的時候，愼之又愼，以免發生什麽誤會，寫了又撕，撕了又寫，已經撕去二十幾張信紙了。我又怕你不認得行書字，所以又端端正正的，寫着楷書字，只看這一點，你可以知道，我把這封信看得怎樣的重大了。我希望你接到這封信，仔細看上幾遍，然後回我一封信。能够約會着在一個地方面談，那就更好。我這樣指望着，大槪不算過分吧？祝您好！好友甘積之上</p>
<p>這封信寫好了，積之寫了一個楊桂枝女士親展的信封，揣在内衣袋裹，就上床睡了。次日在枕上醒來，第一個念頭，便是這封信要怎樣送到桂枝手上去呢？由郵政局寄去，那當然是不妥，因爲怕落到趙翁手上去了。讓女僕送去吧？那至少要多一個人來參與這秘密。想來想去，那還只有親自送到桂枝手上去爲妙。至於要用什麽法子親遞到桂枝手上去，這却不是一天可以解决的事，只好等機會了。他下了這樣的决心，就遲了兩天不曾走，一日要到大門口來徘徊好幾回，在第二日下午，居然遇到桂枝上大門口來了。他也没有工夫再顧慮一切，老遠的鞠着躬，掏出信伸着遞了過來。桂枝見他遞上信來，心中已是突突亂跳，本待不接收，又怕拉扯着躭擱工夫，等别人看見，只得接過信來，立刻向袋裹一塞，臉也就隨着紅起來了。（三八七）</p>

<p>潘蘭史先生，氣節文章，名重海内，隱居海上，詩酒自娛。前住北四川路克明路，與余常相過從，談詩縱酒，脫略不覊，往往徵妓侑觴，聽歌起舞，當筵拇戰，逸興彌豪。余曾卽席口占二絶云：瓊樓夜飲醉何辭，座有名花照酒厄，怕聽秋娘金縷曲，靑衫誤我少年時。合歡花伴綺筵開，釧底香浮　灧杯，老去樊川狂未減，閒悉不到酒邊來。先生激賞末句，朗吟再四，余前編中社雜誌，先生撰詩話萬言，現尙有存稿未刋者。自一二八滬變後，先生遷居福履理路，會晤遂稀，際此春光明媚，正擬往訪先生，共謀一醉，詎料噩耗傳來，先生遽歸道山，哲人云亡，曷勝於悒！爰撰一聯以輓之，詞云：風流同白太傳，豪逸媲陸放翁，最喜有酒有詩，半世閒居在湖海。壽考邁榮啓期，高潔方陶靖節，奚羨成仙成佛，千秋不朽是文章。又代孔敎會撰一聯云：聖敎化蠻夷，講學柏林，君驚綺歲聲華，韋布能傾卿相。豢情寄詩酒、隱身滬海，堪歎平生蕭瑟，遺笥祗有文章。（不受酬）</p>

<p>— 怐子</p>
<p>時常聽見大人先生們歎『才難』，難道眞個是才難嗎？老實，這樣的國家；這樣的社會，便是眞正有人才，也是不能發展；所以一方面奇才異能之士，老死　下，一方面却大家嚷着才難；眞令着一句韓愈的話，呌做，『其眞無馬耶？其眞不知馬也！』了。</p>
<p>在日本的留學生中，聽說是帝大學生，便覺肅然起敬；因爲非高等學校出身，不能入帝大，高等學校，譬如是帝大的豫科，帝大一年，是不收高等學校以外學生的；所以一聲說是帝大學生，他留學的資格，至少是五六年以上；物稀爲貴，這是必然之理。</p>
<p>有一位帝大學生，在日本十年以上了：他簡直想不着回中國，你道爲何？源來他是官費，在學一天，自有國家給他錢用：况且他眞有本領，他會製化妝品，甚麽香水雪花髮油之類做的比日本著名本廠家的出品還高明，他自已繪了個商標，向日政府立了案，定了許多玻璃瓶，印了許多招牌紙，向東京市上的各藥房推銷出品，居然大受日本婦女的歡迎，幾於供不應求，他很賺了些錢：日本化妝品本廠家，想招他去做技師，他笑道：『我做這東西，不過是想補助補助學費而已，誰願意帮小鬼們賺錢？』所以便謝絶了！</p>
<p>這位朋友，夫妻倆都在日本；根本上，有國家供給他費用，要是官費不够用，便好在化妝品上沾光些：戴着方帽子，無憂無慮，眞似神仙一般，便此間樂不思蜀，大有終老日本之意：有人勸他回國，他說：回中國去，想自已開廠，没有資本；想帮助人家，只怕没人要，倒不如在此地逍遙快活的好！</p>
<p>他抱定了這個宗旨，所以等畢業年限到了，便由化學科轉人藥物學科，過了四年，又轉入生物學科；这這樣轉來轉去，便成爲帝大的老學生；有一次，他和我大談其　香，我眞佩服他的博學；聽說這位朋友，在帝大，不但是日本學生佩服他，便是敎援們，也都稱許他了不得；可是我們回來已六七年，這一對賢伉儷，却還是飄泊在異國！</p>
<p>像這位朋友，不能不算是人才吧？然而，他竟願意終老異邦；雖然他的見解，不可爲訓，不過逼迫他踏上岐途；國家社會，不能不負一點責任吧？</p>

<p>— 鄧當世</p>
<p>讀死書會變成書獃子，甚至於成爲書廚，早有人反對過了。時光不絶的進行，反讀書的思潮也愈加澈底，於是有人來反對讀任何一種書。他的根據是叔本華的老話，說是倘讀别人的著作，不過是在自已的腦裏給作者跑馬。</p>
<p>這對於讀死書的人們，確是一下當頭棒，但爲了與其探究，不如跳舞，或者空暴躁，瞎牢騷的天才起見，却也是一句值得紹介的金言。不過要明白：死抱住這句金言的天才，他的腦裏却正被叔本華跑了一趟馬，踏得一榻糊塗了。</p>
<p>現在是批評家在發牢騷，因爲没有較好的作品；創作家也在發牢騷，因爲没有正確的批評。張三說李四的作品是象徵主義，於是李四也自以爲是象徵主義，讀者當然更以爲是象徵主義。然而怎樣的是象徵主義呢？向來就没有弄分明，只好就用李四的作品爲證。所以中國之所謂象徵主義，和别國之所謂Symbolism是不一樣的，雖然前者其實是後者的譯語。然而聽說梅特林是象徵派的作家，於是李四就成爲中國的梅特林了。此外中國的法朗士，中國的白璧德，中國的吉爾波丁，中國的高爾基···還多得很。然而眞的法朗士他們的作品的譯本，在中國却少得很。莫非因爲都有了『國貨』的緣故嗎？</p>
<p>在中國的文壇上，有幾個國貨文人的壽命也眞太長；而洋貨文人的可也眞太短，姓名剛剛記熟，據說是已經過去了。易卜生大有出全集之意，但至今不見第三本；柴霍甫和莫泊桑的選集，也似乎走了虎頭蛇尾運。但在我們所深惡痛疾的日本，『吉訶德先生』和『一千一夜』是有全譯的：沙士比亞，歌德，···都有全集：託爾斯泰的有三種，陀思妥也夫斯基的有兩種。</p>
<p>讀死書是害已，一開口就害人；但不讀書也並不見得也。至少，譬如要批評託爾斯泰，則他的作品是必得看幾本的。自然，現在是國難時期，那有工夫譯這些書，看這些書呢，但我所提議的是向着只在暴躁和牢騷的大人物，並非對於正在赴難或『臥薪嘗膽』的英雄。因爲有些人物，是卽使不讀書，也不過玩着，並不去赴難的。</p>
<h3 id="c289">『春浮園日記』 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>四『春浮園日記』，關於景物的，田園詩人生活的叙述，是間有優勝處，文字簡練有致，似竭力的在追慕放翁。此處不妨舉出如下的數例：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>『初九，晴，移綠　梅數株於齋閣之前，可臥而嗅之』。　　（二）</p>
<p>『十九』，晴。玉蘭初放，月下對之，清寒不可言』。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>『十五。同客看月於湖中。酒過數巡，微有小雨，久之漸稠漸大，登湖亭稍避之。須臾，風發水橫，客寒不可耐，皆偎被而坐，淡月苦霧，水樹蒙翳，景色奇絶。諸客宿桷檀林，余宿竹閣，皆不能歸』（辛未，春浮園偶錄）。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>『初四，西府海棠競放，桃李亦間有發者，水仙着數朶，楚楚可憐。晚過般若寺，探菊，傲霜黃一種最佳，季公所畜金雀舌，堪伯仲也』。（蕭齋日記）</p>
<p>士瑋作文，主張『文家妙境，平淡最難臻。蘇公云：漸老漸熟，乃造平淡，近乃能窺此耳』（日涉錄）。又云：『近來爲文，簡而有法』（春浮園偶錄）。這些都反映在他的日記上，成爲一種平淡簡練的風格，自然眞率的特點，足供『文章家之玩賞。其關於社會生活的部分，在士瑋的日記裏，可說是很少很少；像：</p>
<p>『初四，告早魃者紛紛。民生日蹙，卽有年尙難存活，况重之以兵災乎？然人自北來者云，兵燹之後，積尸如山，烟火斷絶，此雖無歲，猶樂國也』（偶錄）</p>
<p>這一類的記識，已頗不易見了。除日常的山居，藝花旅行一類的生活外，也涉及書籍文章之事，如：</p>
<p>『十二。『臥遊錄』潦略如此，想亦意到錄之，非成書也。周公謹『澄懷錄』，亦塞儉無深致。晚，浴罷，茉莉花開』（偶錄）。</p>
<p>此外，關於戲刺的材料，也有兩三則。在總的方面看起來，士瑋的日記，雖竭力的追慕放翁，然像『入蜀記』文字的那樣富有光彩，所反映的作者學術的那樣的淵博，士瑋究竟還不能和他比擬，而况『入蜀記』一書，在文化史上，還有遠超過『春浮園日記』價值的所在。</p>
<p>在最初，我是抱着對『甲行』，『看花』二記一樣的熱望，來讀『春浮園全集』，想把握得這明代遺民的心理生活，結果却給我以失望。在日記裏除一深牧庵日涉錄』一序外，是什麽也没有；詩集裏，也祇有『九日登閣『裏所說的『黍離泣故老，節物厭清尊』幾句；和『籠坪山寺碑記』一文。記中有云：　　『四方雲擾，雲無完巢：家國喪亡，野老　蹙。雖流泉無恙，我陽如故，而悲風離黍，哀感行路。卽欲如子高先生輩攬此秀媚精進之意，一寫山川荒落之悲，寗可得乎』？</p>
<p>祇有這幾句話，沈痛的抒寫了他自已的苦悶。他的小品，日記而外，據『時文自序』，尙有『醉愚小品』一種，惜未得見。日記，在全集中，共收</p>
<p>（一）『春浮園偶錄』（辛未與　　庚午）</p>
<p>（二）『汴遊錄』（辛未）</p>
<p>（三）『蕭齋日記』（按卽『悅生閣日記』），</p>
<p>（四）『南歸日錄』（丁卯）</p>
<p>（五）『深牧庵日涉錄』（癸酉）</p>
<p>共五種六卷，『蕭氏潤餘軒』藏版。（完）</p>

<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>三月六日天雨。起身時，霧一般的濛鬆細雨，已經把窗外的田野，荒山，白茫茫地罩得祇剩了一些模糊的黑色輪廓。站上的站長，電報生，司事，都回房睡覺去了。就是轉軌的，也都跑到鎭上去了：讓揚旗孤獨的　立在雨天裏。這兒來往的車子，都在夜裏。一到雞啼，這許多車子，像是鬼魅，便都躱得没影踪了。車站像是荒廟的殿堂，地上還留着隔晚零亂的脚印，六是一個也没有，該是附近一個人也没有罷？尤其是這種雨天，多荒寂啊！啊！眞是多荒寂啊！</p>
<p>爲了一個人逗留在站上太孤寂了，於是找了一本湘鄂鐵路的旅行指南，看附近有没有什麽名勝古蹟可以去，書上說有老萊子墓和資福寺，資福寺是唐朝勅建的，屢焚屢修，該是没有什麽好玩了。可是老萊子墓離站路程有十七八里，在這種荒寂的山村，在這種細雨的天氣，在這種泥濘的小路，不認識路，没有嚮導，···就是沿路去問鄕下人，不見得都會認識導『老孩子』的長眠地罷？那末，還是去游一下附近的資福寺罷？就是這樣的决定了。</p>
<p>不帶雨傘，秃了頭的在細雨裏走了兩三里路，資福寺也就到了。要不是門樓上明明的寫着『資福寺』三個字，我眞會走了過去都不知道的，是那麽小，是那麽粉刷得白白的廟宇啊！</p>
<p>這座廟是兩進屋，三開間，中間隔了一個天井，因爲後進是什麽菩薩的開光大吉日子，香烟和人影塞滿了一屋子，所以也就没有進去，祇在外面一進屋轉轉走走而已。外面的一進屋，西間是堆雜物的地方，滿是篩水車之類，像是什麽立體派畫家的作品，看了祗有使人氣悶；中間是供的一個女菩薩，神龕上有『紫竹林中』的扁額，大槪是觀音大士了；左西的一間是鎭上警察分派所，中堂掛了一幅總理遺像，下面是一張寫了『上任大吉』的紅紙條兒，總理像前還擺了香爐燭台之類。這個新上任的所長，槪是胖胖的，瞇了眼，時時會哈哈大笑的滑稽人物罷？不然那就是個十足的傻瓜了。</p>
<p>就是這樣探頭探腦的，失了皮夾似的往四處亂找，終後給我找到了一些算是比較古一些的東西了。那是嘉慶時刻的一塊碑石，上面刻了五首詩，前四首是唐宋時名人遊祠的題詩，第五首便是那個捐這塊碑石的縣令的大作。中國文人是世界上最會利用機會的人，又都是十分顧念到流芳百世的人，這位縣令，要是活在現今的中國，想也可以早就出了許多集子，是文壇上的健將了罷？</p>
<p>掏出了抄本，就站在碑前把前四首詩抄起來，（帶了孩子氣的惡作劇心思，故意把第五首扔了），正在看看抄抄的時候，就有許多鄕下人，把我圍住了，有一個鄕下人，還在我背後高聲的說：</p>
<p>『ＸＸＸ捐的錢都是寡婦的，那個寡婦姘上了他，把這種臭錢來行善事，是瞞不過菩薩的！·····』</p>
<p>我起初很有些奇怪這話來的突兀，後來我看到我面前還有一塊善男信女的題名碑，這話大槪是指這個的了。我怱怱地，草草地把四首詩抄完了，向圍住我的人點了點頭，微笑了笑，就這樣神秘地衝出了重圍。</p>
<p>『中國人誰都是好『名』的啊！有錢的，没錢的，讀書的，不識字的，誰都想『名』，想永久的『名』可又都想不化勞力便來攫取這，永久的好名聲！中國人眞是最喜歡做這一套買賣的了！··』這樣一步一滑的走着，想着，不多一會便回到車站裏來了。</p>
<p>拍一拍濕了的外套，見快十二點了，站長們還没起身，於是便把幾日來没整理的日記抄了抄。</p>
<p>這樣的小車站眞是太荒寂了！牠使我想起高爾基著的一篇小說『爲了太單調的緣故』，昨晚我來這兒的時候，已經是夜深了，又是困倦，所以没和站長接談，連他的臉貎都没有瞧清。他會不會也像會爾基這篇小說裏的主人翁一樣呢？</p>
<p>正在這樣想着時，站長便從背後出來了，眞是『說到曹操曹操到』啊，想笑出聲來，終究竭力忍住了。他說了一段抱歉話，接着便是請我進去吃飯，</p>
<p>因爲是早上第一餐，又因爲站長也是江浙人，所以也備了粥。出來在外面飄流了三四年，粥是像故鄕一般暫時被我遺忘了，這次看見了濃黏黏的白粥，突然憶起故鄕的一切可愛來，雖則天氣並不冷，也兀自捧了碗不就去吃，這一餐早餐，眞是吃得最舒適也没有了，</p>
<p>看到桌上的菜，都是怪精美怪豐富的，所以自已有些不安的問起這許多打那兒弄來的，他說這許多菜，他長年都有，他是一個饕餮家，因爲這兒的鷄魚肉比别地都賤；這兒又没有娛樂的地方，牌酒等嗜好他又一槪没有，又爲了職務關係，他輕易走不開一天，老是株守在這小站上，所以把受來的孤寂，悶氣，便一起發洩在吃的菜餚上了，</p>
<p>聽了他的一篇吃經以後，我又想起了高爾基這篇小說裏的主人翁，他們的孤寂是一樣的，</p>
<p>窗外的雨，總是這麽討人厭的霧樣掛着，啊，眞的，這春雨了，不知要落到那一天才停止呢，</p>

<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>『什麽方法？』玄問。</p>
<p>『親愛的，因爲你不肯搬到别處去住，我便要搬了。』歐靜麗决絶而又委婉地說。</p>
<p>『那又何必！』玄料想不到這女孩如此堅决，立刻屈服了。『我搬就是了，你搬起來，不說說</p>
<p>别的，這鋼琴就够笨重的。假若你不幸搬在一些惡劣少年一起，我更不放心了。』</p>
<p>『你說得很對。我早知道你愛我，你一定會信服我的。』歐靜麗滿意地笑了。</p>
<p>『你要我什麽時候搬呢？』</p>
<p>果然，玄辭退了自已的房間，搬到第十四區雅菊别墅裏去。同寓的人們，還以爲歐靜麗和他决裂了呢！以後，他倆便如歐靜麗所規定的辦法，生活着。每星期六晚，歐靜麗與玄痛快地享樂一回，歐靜麗勤奮得很，六月間竟通過了全部的口試筆試。她和玄在巴黎以及巴黎近郊各處，盡興地遊覽了兩個星期，便　回家度暑去了。</p>
<p>暑假中，歐靜麗的父親來到巴黎，參加一個國際的學術大會。因爲歐靜麗的介紹，他便　來訪問玄，這是一個常穿着早禮服的典型的父親，玄很喜歡他。請他嘗了幾次中國菜，又忍不住吐出他對於歐靜麗的傾倒來。歐靜麗的父親點頭微笑，知道了這少年的意思。</p>
<p>第二學年開始，歐靜麗又回到巴黎，玄早在近郊租了半層樓，一共有兩間對着小花園的房子，他便把歐靜麗迎居在那裏，他自已雖然還保留了雅菊别墅的房間，只是有了其他男女朋友的約會，才偶然一去，實際上總在郊外，陪伴着歐靜麗。久别重逢，愛情更加濃郁。歐靜麗因爲法文的讀閱能力增高，也不大進城聽課，只專心預備考試，他倆自稱爲一對未婚夫妻，房主婦一家人，都非常艷羨，老媪用極度殷勤的招待，表示她對於這對靑年男女的喜悅。玄和歐靜麗訂交週年紀念過去以後，他倆便同時寫信給各人的家庭，正式宣布這一段戀愛，祈求兩方家庭的認許。</p>
<p>這在歐靜麗家裏，不引起很大的驚異，因爲她父親回國後，玄已經幾度成爲她家庭談話的材料。歐靜麗的信到家，她父親和她母親的意見立刻背馳起來，她父親很喜歡這東方少年；她母親却非常反對。在那頗保守的國度裏，歐靜麗的自已决定夫壻，是被認爲侵越母權的一回事；而且歐靜麗的選擇，却又落在一個她母親不曾見過的異國靑年身上丨從歐洲到上海，至少要一個月的航程，這個事實，更堅定她母親的反對到底的决心。接着，這件事是由粼居傳到牧師耳裏，牧師特别給歐靜麗的父母一個警告：希臘正敎的女兒，是不能嫁外敎徒的。這樣，連歐靜麗的父親，也不敢維持贊成的意見了他們曾决定立刻要歐靜麗回國，倒底因爲歐靜麗的委婉的解釋，仍許她留在巴黎讀書。</p>
<p>至於玄的家裏，事情還更不利些。玄的父親向來不喜歡玄，尤其是他的婚烟問題，曾給老人以許多不快之感。玄，曾經和一個楊家小姑娘訂婚，玄到二十歲，便不經由家庭，直接和楊小姐通信，同意解除了婚約。兩家追認這婚約的解除時，必得同時也清算因親戚關係而生的經濟關係，於是玄的婚姻問題，一直成爲他父親的惱怒的源泉！他出國時，他母親就以親近西洋女郎爲戒。因此，他的述明他和歐靜麗相愛的信到家的第二天，他父親便拍出電報，禁止他和歐靜麗往來，訂婚更不必說了。他母親來信，侄是平心靜氣的勸喩，從感情上和事實上立言；並且說家庭方面，可以帮助他娶得他曾經求婚被拒的一個表妹。</p>

<h3 id="c293">從日本科學敎育談到中國的兒童科學 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 萬綠叢</p>
<p>前天看到本報敎育消息欄所載周厚樞先生的考察日本敎育之印象一節，想起我們祗會呌喊，打倒日本帝國主義，收回失地，却不會實行的情形，不禁深深地替我們自已汗顏。日本帝國主義可以用嘴巴打倒的麽？就算我們全中國四萬萬五千萬人一齊喊起來罷，日本帝國主義决不會因我們這一喊就倒下去的，祇不過呌他們日本人笑冷了牙齒罷了。</p>
<p>周先生說，我們中國人祇談而不做，日本人却做而不談，談者當然指空談而言，這是毫不誇張的事實。我們中國人是被人打了一個巴掌，便禁不住張開牙齒駡駡：駡得越痛快越好駡過了，似乎這樣就已經報了仇，殊不知那被駡的早已不聲不響地預備着打第二個巴掌，甚或預備眞的『做死你』了。</p>
<p>這是中國民族的一個致命傷，同時也就是中國之所以弱是本之所以强的一個根原罷！</p>
<p>日本自明治維新以來，也不過五六十年的歷史，竟能自不被注意的島國一躍而爲世界上最注目的最强悍的國家，不能不謂基因於他們的理頭苦幹，說到那裏做到那裏，能够從人家的長處實地趕上去。中國革命以後也已經二三十年了，其所以愈弄愈糟者，絶對不是中國人能力的薄弱，而在『祇談而不幹』。　　比方說科學罷，誰都說這是現代國家惟一的國防利器，是今後人類生活不可缺少的工具，要解除國難，挽救中國，惟有提倡科學普及科學，而科學的聲浪也可謂甚囂塵上了，但是實際上，中國的科學界是荒蕪得呌人塞憟的，尤其是兒童科學便格外談不上了。而日本呢，他們『自小學至大學，對於博物理化無不一致注重，』他們的敎師是怎麽耐勞苦不憚煩地引導學生研究科學，他們的學生又是怎樣『用雙手雙眼之觀察實騐採集，並自求問題之解决』，以實騐室作敎室，一邊敎，一邊學，一邊做，那末已本之所以能逞共蠻橫之行爲者，該不是没有原因的了。而且跑到他們的書店裏去，看，專爲兒童書的科學雜誌就不下十數種，普通的自更母容說了。我國年來雖有一兩種比較可觀的科學雜誌出版，但是專爲兒童出的還是未見踪影。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義不是用嘴巴打得倒的，國難不是用嘴巴解除得了的，眞要打倒日本帝國主義，眞要解救國家於危亡，還得從實地埋頭苦幹，歷史告訴我們徒事浮躁，空喊口號是無補於事的，日本帝國主義雖然是我們永世的仇人，但是他們那樣可佩的埋頭苦幹說到那裏做到那裏的精神，還是值得我們模倣的！</p>
<h3 id="c294">龔尹霞女士的死因（上） <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 魏慈</p>
<p>龔女士尹霞偕子女自殺了。這消息無論在誰的腦子裏所引起的回響，必定是『過分悲慘了』！但是，這過分悲慘的事實如何會發生的呢？一個人弄到自置於死地，並置自已死去了的愛人所遺留的愛子愛女於死地，造成這一罕有的悲劇，則她所受到的『生』之痛苦和壓迫，可見是極度深而且重了。</p>
<p>只是，這種深的痛苦和重的壓迫又如何會產生的呢？這，誠如九日申報時評作者元先生所言，『旣非情感衝動，亦非經濟困難，乃生活環境之壓迫也』。龔女士一方面留戀於與死去的愛人所共同創造共同經營的巢穴，以爲精神寄託之所；一方面不願受大家庭生活的束縳和痛苦。前者，是龔女士自已明言的（見遺書，這在一個有知識富於情感生活的人，是一種可能的内心要求），後者，我們只看秦平甫先生信中的『阿姑不過狐疑瑣碎···諸妹出嫁···委婉遷就···躬自厚而薄責於人···含弘···』等字眼，便　可明悉。牠告訴我們，一切大家庭裏必然會發生的矛盾事實和衝突情形，在那一家庭裏也不能例外的没有。龔女士旣感到不願離開上海的家和不願併歸無錫的家的痛苦，所以她在四月十一日接到阿翁來信，於四月十五日以後（二月二十五日之七週後），還曾去找元先生商量子女求學問題，自身職業問題，這應就是求有以打消回錫之提議，以免除她將身受的痛苦底企圖，也就是欲自殺而止者十餘次的一個旁證。但是終於有着不可抗禦的壓力壓迫着她，使她担負不起『分裂』，『有傷情感』，『加端之累』，不『含弘』等等的罪名。她旣傷生活獨立被摧毁，甚至且傷人格獨立被狐疑，於是乎最後只有以自殺來逃避一切苦難了。</p>
<p>依上述推論，可說龔女士之死也曾經過奮鬥，終於不免一死者，無法兩全也！</p>
<p>不過，這完全是龔女士一方面的思想來分析她的行爲的，若我們依『合理的生活標凖』來論斷，則她的行爲是完全錯了。她雖憧憬着合理的生活，但她的思想不足以指導她怎樣去保障她的要求：譬如纒足女子非根本無力涉水爬山，只爲長長的布條將她的能力摧毁了。若龔女士是天足，是未爲封建思想所束縳而完全培植於新世界接受了新思想的人，則她受到的壓迫，就一點也不會成爲壓迫了。我們分析秦家必令龔女士回錫的原因：一方面是想將財產合併攏來（團結）生利積累（默挽氣運、故須『回錫節省開銷，今日少用一文錢，减長孫異日一份累』：他方面或以爲中年寡媳，留居繁華市塲，不合體統。故他以家長有權管理寡媳的財產和干涉寡媳的行動底資格必令媳婦回家去，並更尋出一個『亡魂有命』的理由來做壓陣軍。這些封建社會裏認爲神聖不可侵犯的大道理，須知在今日早已被否認被推翻了。龔女士若是一個接受了新思想對現社會有確切了解的人，認清了處於現社會裏的人，尤其是處於現社會裏的女子，一切生活應惟以理是從，不妥恊，不苟安。反乎眞理的，卽以革命的精神去奮鬥。那麽，她便不會以破壞大家庭的經濟系統爲有過，以帮助大家庭的經濟發展爲分内事，以多積遺產於子孫爲子孫之福，以違反舅姑之命爲有損淑德；更不會相信死去了的丈夫還能在『陰間』發號司令。她應引爲唯一職責的，是保持人格獨立，謀個人能力之發展，盡力使子女受到良好敎育，使他們成爲社會之有用人才。她如具此認識，依她内心所要求的做去，那還用得着苦悶徘徊，無法自處，以至終於自殺嗎？（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c295">城隍廟印象 <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 文心</p>
<p>踏進城隍廟内，就微感到：在充滿了洋氣的上海，城隍廟這塊地方，就比較可以尋味出中國特性的風格。現在雖然百物俱陷於不景氣中，但城隍廟仍是熱鬧如昔，並没有怎樣衰落的景象表露出來。每天都是人山人海，絡續不絶的進出觀玩。初進去時，有些覺得没有什麽奇觀，但是細心看看，又有不盡然之處。好像平淡庸俗的景物裏面，是隱含無限的奇味。有些古董的雅緻的風格，使人感到，文明的古邦，和想到今日的病夫國，而有無窮的慨然！</p>
<p>出了城隍廟，殘存在腦子裏的印象除了這點落漠的懷感之外，就要算那兒的神與女人爲有趣了。那兒數不清的菩薩，實在就是主要的景物呢！香火的氣色，更是濃郁了。從旁邊經過，差點眼淚都要給牠薰出來。說熱鬧還是這兒最爲尤者，拜神的女人，多得令人發笑，一個個都是擺出十分嚴肅的樣子，正經的，雙手拿着燃了的香，正正擺在胸前，身上還掛了一個好像和尙尼姑化緣的袋子，大約是要拜神就必須掛上去那種意思。由左邊拜過右邊，由前而後，挨身而過，都是一式一樣的女人。口裏暗自念着；香插好了，跪下叩頭之後，便是雙手合十，繞着一尊尊的大小菩薩拜揖而過，有時你從菩薩旁邊經過，那就僥倖亦享受了幾個拜揖。她們各種各樣</p>

<p>的不同的菩薩都拜，都念念有詞，在求願。似乎變成了一種極無味的家常便飯了，有點莫名其妙的觀感。覺得一陣好笑之後，又想到爲什麽拜神的完全是女人，一個男子幾乎也没有。一方面覺得神的命運還旺相興隆，有這許多人這麽誠心勞神去拜他，仍是代表了封建意味的濃厚的存在；但是另一方面又似乎感到，單只女人這樣熱鬧拜神，而少了男子拜神，那麽就可以表現，神是漸漸没落了，迷信漸漸除去，男子比較多在社會活動，所以多半給現實的生活所洗掃而少拜神，只殘存女人還沈迷於神的鬼話裏作夢，是有些可喜。然而，問題也並不如此簡單，現在神的命運還是會怎樣衰減！聞家鄕那兒，大人們正在高唱復古，由復古而拜神拜彿，似乎在無法中，復古與迎神是聊可以成爲對策，作救時之一方。我可不禁復想到城隍廟的神的興盛，在目今的世界，是一種比較特有風格的情調。</p>
<h3 id="c296">阿福 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>阿福的妻子已經死去一個整月了。這一月當中，他的生活是窘苦創痛得萬分，他不但放工回來要爲自已燒飯洗衣服，並且還要替他的病了兩個星期的四歲大的孩子煎藥，洗尿屎褲子。這種生活，雖然他才當了短短的一個月，但他確够累的了。半夜裏，當他在昏沉的睡夢中給他的孩子哭醒了的時候，他總是凄寒地嘆着氣喊他的妻子，並且抱怨自已的苦命。</p>
<p>近兩天來，他孩子的病更加凶了，成天的哭呌着，小身子差不多會燒乾了，瘦小烏黑的面龐，浮着一層赭色，眸子也像失了光采些的。阿福請了假在家裏守候着他可憐的孩子，他把妻子遺下的一對包金的戒指，換了一元二角錢，爲孩子看了幾次醫生，但孩子還是依然的病着。他急得没有主張了，把間壁的李媽媽請了過來，問她應當怎樣辦法。李媽媽說是像這樣成天不退燒，一定不是醫藥可能奏效的，大槪是時辰不好，碰着了什麽鬼神吧？所以她呌他不必爲他的孩子再看醫生了，醫生是白看的，還是到清凉寺去問問神，求個仙方來試試看，晚上多買些錫箔錢紙之類。請王婆婆來把神收住，將鬼趕退。那末，明天必定會好了。阿福含着一包眼淚，心裏萬分難受的接受了李媽媽的忠告，把床上躺着哭呌的孩子托了李媽媽，自已從床上揭了一床很多尿跡而破爛現出了烏黑的花絮的棉被，夾着出門去了。</p>
<p>三小時以後，阿福滿頭大汗地氣喘着跑回家來，那條破爛烏黑的棉被已換得了四毛小洋，連自已袋裏僅有的四毛配成八毛，買了幾塊錫箔，一紥紙錢，還帶了四塊醬肉，一包花生米，預備給王婆婆今晚爲他的孩子作法趕鬼後下酒的。他又從懷裏掏出那仙方來，這裏所謂仙方，是一條黃表紙，上歪斜地寫着用灶上的黃土和甘草煎水給孩子服。　　服了仙方，普經王婆婆作法趕鬼後的第　天，他們孩子果然安靜得多了，不但不大哭呌，也不喊吃要喝，只是一味昏沉沉地迷住在睡鄕裏，喊他，推他，要費了價多的氣力和方法才把他弄醒，摸摸他的小額，還是熱得灼人的手心，因此，阿福倒嫌這情形太安靜了，而内心裏感覺着無名的焦急和慌懼。他又含着一包眼涙去求敎他的高鄰李媽媽。李媽媽就再來看了一次，仍然是老氣橫秋，鼓着她那兩片乾癟的嘴唇怪有理由地說：阿福哥，『不妨事的，不必心急，仙方服下去要過一天一夜才見效，孩子想睡，讓孩子睡睡，别嚷他，对可憐見的，你不是說七八天來都是一夜吵鬧到大天亮嗎？小小年紀，這也該辛苦了，讓他安靜些吧。我對你說，醫生是最靠不住的，我活了這一把年紀，就從來没看過醫生，每次腰酸背庝，都是求一個仙方吃吃就好了，仙方眞是靈效不過的。』李媽媽一邊自信地說着，一邊替孩子把一條夾被蓋着。</p>
<p>就在這一夜裏，從兩點鐘起，床上躺着的孩子就起了變化。先還只是緊咬着牙齒哼着，慢慢地揑了拳頭，白眼珠翻起，在床舖上亂滾亂滾，喉嚨裏直着聲音嚷着。阿福更没辦法了，只是没有主張地聲聲呌着『我的乖乖兒呀！』涙珠點點滴在焦熱的小身體上。</p>
<p>挨到五更的光景，孩子喉頭給一吐痰糊住了，咕嚕咕嚕地把呼吸也加促了，再挨了半小時，孩子就斷了氣，阿福知道不行了就傷心地大聲哭喊起來。</p>
<p>不知不學阿福已是一個星期没進廠做工了，這時爲着要錢收拾他這可憐的孩子，才想起廠裏還有一個星期的工錢没有拿，心裏劃算着把這四塊錢支出來，再向會計處周先生哀求預支一個星期的工錢，大槪八塊錢連葬連請一個道士吟點經總够事了，因爲他只一個孩子，並且今後僅他孤單單的一個人了，所以他不願意太給孩子潦草了。</p>
<p>他蹣跚地趕進廠裏來，大清早，廠裏還只有幾個人，看門巡捕不許他進去，問他找誰，他說他是本廠的銅匠，孩子死了，想來找會計處周先生借幾塊錢，巡捕就告訴他，說他請假太長久了，廠裏不能不開工，工頭早已另找了新工補進了，並且他還告訴他，他的名牌是在他請假後三小時就除掉的。</p>
<p>阿福受了這意外絶大的刺激，幾乎都昏了過去，心裏想，一年到頭做牛馬，孩子病了，死了，不應該請假麽？請假不拿錢，還算過分麽？這該死的社會該死的人，該死的工頭丨丨這狗我見着了他總要做掉他！一個純良忠厚的阿福，這時竟像一個暴君，一個瘋狗，眼睛裏充滿了血，握了拳頭向四週巡望着，像是要尋誰撕打般的。</p>
<p>在廠的附近，他守候了許久，看見男的，女的，小孩子們提着籃笑嘻嘻地進廠去了，其中好多人都是平常和他講得來的，他跑過去招呼他們，他們有的略同他說了一聲早，有的没有理睬他，有的竟向他輕薄地笑着。這對他的威脅可說是至大了，於是他的危險可怕的念頭，更加深切了。他看見遠遠地挺起肚子著學生裝的人來了，他認清楚這來的正是他的敵人，他躱在一個暗處，讓那大肚子的走過去，他就揀了一塊石頭趕上朝那人的後腦死命擲去，那人被擊倒了。</p>
<p>當天午飯邊，阿福的鄰舍都紛紛地傳說阿福打死人，抓到公安局去了。</p>

<p>上海没有春天，我的心更是没有春意！</p>
<p>生活在這地洞似的上海，飛快是七個年頭了，他就過了七個春天。可是，在上海我不曾看到過有春天，四季彷彿一般兒像，也没有秋冬。若有的話，那便只有在人的活躍上，尤其是女人的顫巍巍的體態上，去細細的領味。然而，這畢竟是太苦了，我是這般的與女人没缘呵！</p>
<p>這就出乎我的意料了，我住上了這麽一間高高的樓房，幽靜的環境，空曠的窗外，使我異樣的感覺適意，每日工作之餘，便得憑窗遠眺，吐洩胸底的積鬰，凝視紛陳的外景，這樣，有時雖然像是成了迷戀的人似的，但也僅僅有這麽一種適意的心情，我没有非分的歹念，也没有什麽希冀。</p>
<p>這就更出乎我的意料了，最近，我發現了窗外遠遠的那座茅屋裏有一個輕盈窈窕的少女，身材是那麽苗條的，棉軟的，態度是那麽嫻淑的，天眞的。第一次見了，我原不在意，爲的是我斷定伊不是那茅屋裏的出產，而是誰家的舞星。然而我每天每天的憑窗遠望，都看到伊的傅影。於是『漸漸的我起了眷戀的心念。伊的頻顧的流眸，分明的表白了伊的心跡，伊原不像一般的女人，討厭我們這等庸人呵！</p>
<p>爲了獲得這一點點縹渺的慰藉，使我覺得上海，今年竟有一個春季，彷彿見得春在窗前飛舞，實際上春是已經别離人間，而今是夏天了。我的心更是春意纏綿，洗凈了幾年來的積鬰，一刻刻的心在跳躍，生命也彷彿增添了幾分朝氣。可是呀，我也僅僅有這一點點眷戀的心情，爲的是我早已······</p>
<p>姑娘呀，請你珍惜人間的春意吧！我並没有非分的歹念，也没有什麽希冀！</p>

<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>去年，聽濤社曾出版一本『食肉者言』，我雖没有親自翻閱過；但，據朋友們說，内面所收集的，是現今當政者們在野時所發表的言論。這些言論，到底是在說個什麽，我没有親眼看過，當然不敢盲目臆測；但，如果誰肯花費一些時間，細心翻讀一回，或許也會得到一種怪異樣的感覺吧！</p>
<p>這且不必多提，因自已不是銅皮鐵骨，飛簷走壁的好漢。現且回頭來看看我們十多年來的文壇情形吧：</p>
<p>『五四』時代，由於西歐自由思想的影響，和國内資產階級的抬頭，一班英勇的戰士們，對於我國數千年來的『載道』文學，是做過一番由形式的破壞到内容的解放的運動的。這一個運動，其結果的確得到相當的成功，而這一批英勇的戰士們，也就由此而飛黃騰達了。　　『五卅』時代，由於革命高潮的激蕩，文學的趨勢，又起了一番大轉變，在這轉變中，一批新的英雄，又由此得以登上龍座了。</p>
<p>『五四』時代的戰士，『五卅』時代的英雄，在當時對於舊勢力的推翻和對於新文學的建樹的功績，是誰都不敢輕易否認的；但，及至功成名得了的現在，他們又在幹個什麽了呢？</p>
<p>我們不是色盲者，我們是可以看得很清楚的：在他們中間，不是有的已無端地玩起骨董來，大做古香古色的律詩，互相贈和，以示風雅；有的則歸依權門，寫些歌功頌德的奴才文章，以取悅主子：有的則瀟洒自適，玩山遊水，吟風弄月，隨意之所之寫些遊記雜感之類，聊以自遺了嗎？他們不但『五四』『五卅』時代的英雄氣慨，這時早已烟消無跡；就現在是一個什麽時代，他們這麽一來，對於整個文壇會發生個什麽影響，他們也一槪不管。</p>
<p>有人說，我國文壇上的現象，和我國官塲的情景，原就没有多大的分别。這話，到底是否說得對，我不敢說。但，如果有人要問這些已成了仙的權威作家們，爲甚三變就變成。這樣子時，我相信，他們的答覆，也的確是這樣的：『彼一時也，此一時也！』</p>
<p>這是『時』也，誰都相信；但，時間的長流，是否會從此就停滯着呢？這我不敢說，其實也不必我說。</p>

<p>— 胡雷</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>『敎育萬能！』這是中國士大夫的見解。他們儘管想拿敎育來領導社會，來改造社會，但所得的事實告訴他這是幻夢，這僅僅是幻夢而已！他們没有明瞭敎育是社會的上層機構，敎育是跟着政治，尤其是經濟，在那裏演變。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>在這形勢萬分險惡的環境裏，有一般敎育者，他們發覺了敎育僅僅是一種工具，不能領導社會，改造社會時，便失望，悲哀，以爲敎育者已是一種無路可走的人。</p>
<p>敎育者果曾已無路可走嗎？不，絶不！在敎育之領域内，等待敎育者的工作多着呢！</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>敎育者，凖備起來，凖備擔負偉大歷史賦紿你應盡的使命。敎育者的力量，在今日，雖然是有限度的，但歷史給你的責任你得去盡。敎育者應去幹社會改造的凖備工作。</p>
<p>目前，一般意態相同或接近的敎育者們，他們很少有相當的組織。就是有組織，動機也是出發於一二爲英雄主義救世主義所迷的人們，這是很不對的。眞正敎育者應有的組織，是鐵一般的，同時，是大衆的組織。在組織裏，没有英雄，也没有門徒！</p>
<p>在現在，敎育者們爲了形成一種力而要有一定方式的組織，是不可能的。只有利用環境，視環境而變換組織的方式。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>敎育者，凖備起來！凖備社會的改造工作！先組織起來吧！</p>

<p>— 編者的話</p>
<p>當然，現在的一切婚姻糾葛大都是婚姻制度本身的缺憾，當事人都是『新舊交替社會下的犧牲者』。</p>
<p>不過，若以『犧牲』的可否補救來說，無疑的吃虧仍是女性，不離婚固如李君所說，雙方都受到痛苦，但離婚了，男的固可從此脫離苦海，免受『這不合理的結合所賦予的苦痛』，但女白方面呢，則痛苦較不離更甚。這一點從程女士來的第一信可以看出：『離婚我有三個不願：第一不願，····他離了，他可以做新官人，我却不可以做什麽新人：第二，我看了空谷蘭上後母把那紉珠所生的兒子恨心的痛打，我離了，兩個孩子也要受這痛苦；···第三，我家中並不是什麽下等人家，···我又没有什麽不好的事做過，離了我父母的臉在裏。』第二，第三，兩個顧慮，雖在事實上所難免，究有補救之方，至於『第一不願』則確係大問題，李君以爲不離婚是『令她守活寡』，然離了婚他就可再嫁而不受『凄凉的活罪』麽，在這個社會上，恐亦甚難。</p>
<p>所以在現社會上婚姻糾葛，根本是無適當圓滿的補救的。這一點李君的見解很對。但是我個人却總認爲，在這裏不合理的婚姻下的丈夫，應當多犧牲一點，縱令妻子極舊式，雙方根本不能接近，却也不宜全以個人的利益爲出發點，貿貿然談離婚，更不應『另愛新人』而置之不理。家庭幸福固然在人生上有極重要意義，但是人生却不是完全爲着愛情而生活。在愛情上有缺陷者，可在别一方面去謀得滿足，抵償這種缺憾。亞丹斯密士終身不娶，他的精神却也不見得是『極端難堪』，他視學問上的成就，爲他幸福的源泉，把夫婦之愛轉移到學問方面去了。當然，我們不希望一般人都能够這樣，但，婚姻的不美滿不是一個人的幸福完全喪失，寗非很明顯的麽？</p>
<p>此外，關於你所詢的三問，在來信箱中已常有討論茲不多贅，不本說我武斷你『另有新人』我却要對你聲明，我固然是根據她的『片面之詞』，但照其第一信所說的事實看，恐怕也决不是揑造的罷。編者</p>

<h3 id="e1">League of Nations Advisory Committee Decides on Three Principles for Postal Services of the Puppet Manchukuo. Plans for Unified Postal Service Are Purely Administrative and Technical in Nature. No Invocation of Postal Conventions or Recognition of National Relations Allowed. Technical Cooperation Committee Meeting Held Yesterday. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations Advisory Committee on Manchurian Affairs met to discuss the postal relations issue of "Manchukuo." It resolved that postal matters should not be considered by governments but can be resolved through negotiations between relevant postal administrations. However, it must be made clear that negotiations on postal relations should not be regarded as any plan to recognize the new state. When the original British draft on this issue was being prepared, the strong wording was indeed advocated by U.S. representative Wilson. The committee subsequently decided on the following three points: (1) The "Manchukuo" Ministry of Communications cannot apply to oppose the provisions of the Universal Postal Convention.</p>
<p>(2) The postal administrations of League of Nations member states must uniformly implement temporary plans for transporting mail through Manchuria.</p>
<p>(3) These plans should be purely administrative and technical, not established between countries or governments.</p>
<p>The committee also insisted that all postal administrations implementing plans for transporting mail through Manchuria should make a clear statement confirming the third point. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee resolved that, regarding the issue of postal communication between League of Nations member states and Northeast China, the so-called "Manchukuo" Ministry of Communications may not invoke the League's agreement to file petitions. However, in the General Assembly report and the committee's recommendations, the measures taken by League of Nations member states are not based on agreements or institutions established by agreements for temporary legislation. When mail is transferred through Manchuria, if League of Nations member states are unable to adopt this method, they may consider technical solutions in accordance with the usual practices between postal administrations of various countries. However, this method should only be regarded as a measure taken by League of Nations member states to ensure appropriate technical services and should not be regarded as relations between countries or governments, otherwise, it will cause disputes. Regarding the opium export incident, the so-called "Manchukuo" committee decided to consult with the Opium Advisory Committee again to formulate a new import management system, with certificates issued by relevant consuls. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Advisory Committee on Chinese Affairs discussed the issue of mail passing through Manchuria starting from the 14th and selected Dutch representative Maurisco as chairman. The committee recently decided on the following three principles based on Maurisco's proposal: (1) The "Manchukuo" transportation authorities may not invoke the provisions of the Universal Postal Convention regarding postal relations between the country and the countries that have joined the Universal Postal Union. (2) The League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly (February 24, 1933) had a resolution not to recognize "Manchukuo," and the Advisory Committee on Chinese Affairs (June 14 of the same year) also notified all League of Nations member states and non-member states of the implementation of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" (the second item concerns postal matters). However, if the League of Nations member states believe that temporary measures should be taken under the current situation to allow mail to be sent and transported through Manchuria, this is still feasible. The decision of the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly and the notification from the Advisory Committee should not be regarded as preventing such temporary measures. However, when member states take temporary measures, they should not be based on international postal conventions and should not establish any international conventions or use any institutions established by international postal conventions. When relevant postal authorities deem it appropriate, they can refer to generally applicable technical solutions between postal authorities of various countries to determine these temporary measures. (3) When postal authorities of League of Nations member states have relations with the postal authorities of "Manchukuo" due to these temporary measures, these relations should only be regarded as relations between administrative agencies for maintaining good postal technical operations, and should not be regarded as relations between countries or governments. To prevent this purely technical relationship from causing confusion, the committee proposed that whenever postal authorities of League of Nations member states need to send documents to the "Manchukuo" post office, the documents must explicitly state for the first time that the documents are administrative documents between administrative agencies, and their purpose is only to maintain good postal technical operations, and cannot be regarded as relations between governments, nor can it be considered the application of the Universal Postal Convention.

The Pseudo Police of Gubeikou Will Withdraw After the New Barracks Are Completed. <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng visited the Japanese embassy this morning to meet with Chaisan to discuss the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Ji County. Both parties agreed to send representatives to Ji County to meet with Hayashida in person to resolve the issue. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chaisan said that the Yu Pass meeting was to discuss the unfinished matters of the war zone and the reorganization of the security forces. The newly formed security force has been trained and is ready, totaling 8,000 people, and can be rotated within a month. At the time of the rotation, the Japanese side will monitor the situation. Heavy and light machine guns may not be carried. The Ji County incident will not escalate and can be resolved soon. The pseudo police of Nantianmen can be withdrawn within a week, and there is no problem in receiving Malanyu. All issues in the war zone are expected to be completely resolved within a month. The issues of traffic and postal service were not discussed in Yu Pass. Whether Beidaihe will be discussed is unknown to me. Yin Rugeng said that the Ji County incident is currently under negotiation and will not cause problems. The Japanese troops stationed in Ji County initially numbered 200, but a portion withdrew to Malanyu on the 13th. The rest were originally scheduled to be completely withdrawn yesterday, but unexpectedly, a traitor falsely reported to the Japanese side that the Ji County militia had heavy firearms. As a result, the Japanese troops used this as an excuse to suspend the withdrawal. He has now sent Secretary Qu Shihe to negotiate with Japanese Regiment Commander Hayashida. The heavy firearms possessed by the militia were mostly intercepted from defeated soldiers. He has now stated to the Japanese side that he will confiscate them himself, and the Japanese side does not need to act on his behalf to avoid causing misunderstandings among the local people. Receiving Malanyu will only have hope of progress after Huang Bei returns. The pseudo police of Nantianmen Gubeikou can be withdrawn soon. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">On Soviet Russia Joining the League of Nations <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The current League of Nations Executive Council is holding a meeting. It reaffirmed the principle of non-recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo. Furthermore, the Soviet Union, a nation established outside the capitalist system, is also reportedly considering joining the League. Both of these matters are directly related to the overall situation in the Far East, with the latter having a particularly significant impact. Therefore, it warrants our attention.</p>
<p>During the era when the Trotsky faction held power in the Soviet Union, their mission was to complete the world revolution. Their aggressive strategy was broadly divided into two: First, to move westward into Europe, stirring up revolution in Germany, where people were in extreme fear. Second, to move eastward into Asia, using the slogan of overthrowing imperialism to incite struggles. After the Trotsky faction lost power and the Stalin faction rose, they recognized the changing situation in Western Europe and the many difficulties in East Asia. They were compelled to temporarily place the world revolution as secondary and instead prioritize the wealth and power of their own country. The motivation behind their proclaimed good-neighborly diplomacy over the years lies in this. However, although the Soviet Union has established mutual non-aggression treaties with its neighboring small countries in Europe, using them as a peacetime shield with ample buffer, should war occur, small countries like Finland and Lithuania would have extremely weak self-defense capabilities. Relying solely on the guarantee of a few flimsy non-aggression treaties is simply insufficient. Therefore, they cannot but cultivate friendly relations with France and woo Italy as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's greatest hypothetical enemy in Western Europe is Germany. After the National Socialist Party took power in Germany, it openly raised the banner of anti-communism and actively engaged in activities in the small countries bordering the Baltic Sea adjacent to the Soviet Union. Although Hitler signed a mutual non-aggression treaty with Poland, the "Corridor" issue remains fraught with serious crisis. Once Poland is in distress, how can the Soviet Union rest easy? Germany withdrew from the League of Nations over the issue of military equality. If it were not prepared and determined to forcefully change the status quo, it would not have done so. If the League of Nations organization were to dissolve, the outbreak of war would be accelerated. Before the Soviet Union's internal arrangements are fully in place, it naturally does not want to be drawn into the vortex. However, with the overall trend inevitably developing, it cannot stand idly by. Therefore, from the perspective of Soviet interests, joining the League of Nations Executive Council to enhance its international status and reassert its vigilance against Germany is indeed a well-considered strategy.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the urgency of the Far Eastern situation is increasing daily. The implementation of the so-called second step of Japan's continental policy will inevitably lead to serious conflicts with the interests of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot but engage in appropriate responses, such as increasing the funding and supplies for the Far Eastern Army Corps and specifically exempting eastern Siberia from taxes. These are all steps in its preparations for war. However, these alone are still not enough to ensure complete security. Since the application of diplomatic means is a strength of that country, it would naturally not let go of any opportunity that benefits it. After the "September 18th" Incident, although the League of Nations and the Soviet Union's observations on the Far Eastern issue were not completely identical, their anti-Japanese stance was essentially the same. It is not impossible for the two sides to mutually unite based on this stance.</p>
<p>The difficulty lies in the fact that the Soviet Union is unwilling to join unconditionally, and its terms for joining are reportedly not easily accepted by some League of Nations member states. Newspaper reports from Moscow indicate many conditions for participating in the League of Nations. The most important ones are: (1) All League of Nations member states must unanimously recognize the Soviet Russian government. (2) All member states must sign mutual non-aggression treaties with Soviet Russia. (3) Demand for racial equality. It is well known that Switzerland refuses to recognize Soviet Russia. Since the League of Nations is located on Swiss territory, Switzerland's resistance cannot be ignored. As for the signing of mutual non-aggression treaties and the demand for racial equality, they concern the overall European situation and the issues of ethnic minorities, which are difficult to realize at once. Therefore, according to our observations, the Soviet Union's joining of the League is unlikely to materialize before the League's general assembly in September.</p>

The battle lasted from 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM, capturing three solid blockhouses and nine earthen forts. In the evening, 3,000 bandits from the puppet 10th Army, 83rd, 87th regiments, and the Hengfeng independent battalion, equipped with heavy and light machine guns, came to reinforce from Hengying, attacking us from three sides. We defended the blockhouses calmly and counterattacked victoriously in the evening when the bandits could no longer withstand. The battle lasted until 7:00 PM, and the bandits collapsed and retreated sixty miles, leaving a mountain of corpses. According to prisoners, the participating units in this battle were the 83rd, 85th, and 87th regiments, transferred from Shangrao. The 85th regiment did not participate because they were holding the position. The puppet army commander is missing a left hand. (17th Dispatch)</p>

Before the revision of the autonomy regulations by the Legislative Yuan is promulgated, it is feared that the provinces and cities may not fully understand the content and meaning, making it difficult to implement.

<p>(Nanjing) At 11:00 PM on the 16th, a conflict occurred between the railway police at Xiaguan Station and the driver of the Ministry of Finance's car, who was escorting Kong Xiangxi to Shanghai. The railway police opened fire and shot Huo Ziduan, a staff member of the Ministry of Finance, in the left leg. He was taken to Gulou Hospital for treatment.

<p>(Berlin) Stephen, a correspondent for the London Daily Mail in Berlin, accompanied by his wife and her younger cousin, traveled by car today to investigate Germany's economic situation. Arriving at Ahlen, they saw arc lamps and heard hammering and machinery noises in the woods. Driven by curiosity, Mr. Stephen got out of the car to investigate, only to have all three arrested by National Socialist Party members and handed over to the secret police, who confined them to a hotel under police guard. Upon hearing the news, the British consul rushed to negotiate with the authorities, and the three were later released. According to police statements, the actions of Mr. Stephen and others were suspicious, hence the arrest, but leniency has been granted. According to reports from London today, military-related projects have been under construction in the Ahlen area for some time and are highly secretive. Therefore, after Mr. Stephen and his party were arrested, many believed they would be charged with espionage. Mr. Stephen's release is temporary; the authorities have forbidden him from leaving Mertitzburg and require him to report his whereabouts to the police station. The authorities claim that Mr. Stephen illegally photographed a chemical factory, hence the arrest. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Various parties still do not admit failure.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Efforts to refute rumors are great.</p>
<p>Britain plans to make a final effort to facilitate a partial agreement.</p>
<p>Washington prepares to issue a statement clarifying its attitude on disarmament.</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to recent developments today, the Disarmament Conference, which European politicians have painstakingly worked on for two years, has indeed come to an end. When the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference meets on May 29, this matter will be formally announced. This decision is reportedly the result of talks between diplomats from Britain, France, Italy, and the United States. The four diplomats are now devising a way to conclude the conference for approval by the General Commission of Disarmament. The Associated Press was the first to disclose the news of the dissolution of the Disarmament Conference, which was repeatedly denied by European politicians involved in the matter. However, representatives from various countries subsequently admitted that the General Commission of Disarmament may take this step. Britain has always advocated the conclusion of a disarmament treaty, but it is now clear that general disarmament is hopeless. However, some British politicians still believe that it is not impossible to conclude an air force disarmament agreement. It is said that American diplomats participated in the discussions on dissolving the Disarmament Conference, but they only acted behind the scenes. Military experts here are now eager for the White House to issue a statement on the US's disarmament policy. The White House announced last night that President Roosevelt and the American disarmament representative Davis are preparing a joint statement to be released when Mr. Davis goes to Geneva to attend the General Commission of Disarmament on May 29. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations quickly denied reports today that the Disarmament Conference had decided to adjourn. French Foreign Minister Barthou refuted it with particular vehemence, saying that he still has hope for the Disarmament Conference. However, despite this denial from the League of Nations, it is generally recognized that the conference is unlikely to succeed. Therefore, the possibility of the General Commission of Disarmament reporting back to the League of Nations Executive Council has become a topic of discussion. Reliable sources believe that when the General Commission meets on May 29, it may not be easy to extend the life of the Disarmament Conference beyond half a month. Many people firmly believe that the best and most prudent approach is to have a long adjournment, during which economic conditions may create better opportunities to resolve disarmament. At the same time, a telegram from Washington stated that President Roosevelt announced that he is preparing a document that fully clarifies the US's attitude toward disarmament, which will be announced by the American representative Davis, who is attending the Disarmament Conference in Geneva as an observer. However, President Roosevelt did not indicate any changes in US policy. (16th Reuters Dispatch) (London) London newspapers today expressed shock and dismay at the reports that the Disarmament Conference may collapse. The Archbishop of Canterbury issued a statement today on behalf of the Christian Church, saying that the failure of the Disarmament Conference would be an unforgivable betrayal of the public's expectations and aspirations. British Foreign Secretary Simon gave a speech here today, saying that he will go to Geneva to do his best to facilitate an agreement to resolve this complex and troubled situation. This statement by Simon suggests that although the hope for a large-scale convention has been extinguished, Britain is still determined to establish a framework convention to prohibit chemical and bacterial warfare, or to establish a European agreement to prohibit aerial attacks and abolish offensive weapons. The Huibao newspaper reported that Britain is now considering the details of an agreement to prohibit aerial bombardment, intending to obligate signatory countries to jointly bomb violators as a warning. If this effort by Britain still fails, the Disarmament Conference will hand this task back to the League of Nations, which will then transfer it to Germany, Russia, and the United States to handle.

<p>(Berlin) The report from a foreign news agency here that the great powers have agreed in principle to an indefinite adjournment of the Disarmament Conference caused a sharp surprise here, but it soon subsided, as reports from London, Paris, and elsewhere immediately corrected it. According to reports from London, there has been no word of the Disarmament Conference closing, while reports from Paris directly call it inaccurate. German political circles feel that although the Disarmament Conference has reached a dead end, it will not readily admit its failure and hastily announce an adjournment until it finds a suitable way to shift responsibility.

<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Barthou gave a speech to representatives of the British and American press, saying that on April 6 of this year, France sent a verbal note to the British government on the issue of disarmament, explaining the guarantees for the implementation of the disarmament treaty. This verbal note will be published in the Yellow Paper on approximately Monday of next week. On January 29 of this year, Britain also sent a verbal note to the French government, proposing that France recognize Germany's partial rearmament, subject to supervision, in order to solve the disarmament problem by concluding a partial treaty on this basis. On March 17, France replied, "Although the British memorandum of January 29 has been modified and new implementation guarantees have been added as the basis for the treaty, France cannot accept it according to the current state of negotiations, because this approach leaves various unresolved technical and political problems unaddressed, which is too broad. If it is implemented, it will cause misunderstandings, because various technical and political problems have only been mentioned, but the raising of the issues cannot be regarded as a solution." The French verbal note of April 6, between March 17 (the French reply to the British memorandum of January 19) and April 17 (the French second formal reply to the British) is sufficient to prove that France still believes that disarmament can be solved even in the face of Germany's rearmament. After Barthou read out the French note, the reporters in attendance were reportedly moved. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The Daily Mail reported today that after Britain, France, Italy, and the United States agreed to an indefinite suspension of the disarmament conference, Britain is now planning a new and powerful defense plan. According to the newspaper's political reporter, the new defense plan will expand the Air Force to be on par with the world's strongest air forces. The expansion of the Navy is already being planned by the Admiralty, and other defense plans will also be implemented. Another reporter from the London Chronicle stated that the British government is still considering a disarmament treaty for the Air Force to salvage the remnants of the disarmament conference. The reporter continued, "Britain suggests that aerial bombardment of cities should be completely prohibited. Any country that violates this regulation should be immediately bombed by the other allied countries. Therefore, only if all countries accept Britain's air force disarmament proposal can Britain's large-scale air force expansion plan be cancelled." Air defense safety is a concern for Britain because London is the most vulnerable of the world's major cities to bombing. Daytime bombers within 300 miles and nighttime bombers within 600 miles can freely fly to London and drop bombs. The British Air Force only has 1,500 aircraft, which is insufficient for defense. Even in wartime, the British Air Force would only have 2,000 aircraft and 300,000 personnel. Therefore, in terms of first-line air power, Britain is almost on par with countries like Yugoslavia and Poland, far behind other major air powers. Moreover, the British Air Force is scattered throughout its territories, and only 480 first-line fighter aircraft are available to defend London. Furthermore, London's ground air defense equipment has been neglected. (National News Agency, 17th)</p>

All members present agreed with the principle of Eden's proposal and will discuss it at a later meeting. Italy stated that it could only join after a common agreement is established.

<p>(Geneva) The British government's Lord Privy Seal, Eden, proposed to the League of Nations Council today that all countries of the world unanimously embargo arms to Bolivia and Paraguay to stop the Gran Chaco war. When Eden put forward the proposal, he made a solemn speech, requesting the League of Nations Council to immediately telegraph the major countries of the world as well as the United States and the neighboring countries of Bolivia and Paraguay to implement a crackdown on the transportation of arms and military supplies to the two countries. Eden declared, "We should implement a stop to this unnecessary sacrifice of life. This is the responsibility of all the countries of the world as well as the neighboring countries of the belligerents. For the sake of peace, for the sake of humanity, we cannot hesitate any longer and should take urgent action." The attending representatives unanimously and enthusiastically supported this proposal. The Council can make a concrete decision tomorrow, but whether the arms embargo initiated by the League of Nations can be implemented depends on the attitude of the United States. As for the support of South American countries, there is no doubt. (National News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>(London) The British government, because Bolivian aircraft openly bombed an undefended Paraguayan city, and Paraguay threatened to take the same retaliatory action, believing these actions to be in violation of the 1899 Hague Convention, issued instructions to the British envoys stationed in Bolivia and Paraguay, ordering them to lodge a protest with the governments of the two countries respectively.

<p>Belgrade. Prussian Prime Minister General Göring will arrive here by plane this afternoon to meet with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić. Diplomatic circles view Göring's trip as further evidence of the close relationship between Germany and Yugoslavia in resisting Italy's policy in Central Europe. Göring will also travel to Athens tomorrow. The reason Germany opposes Italian policy is that Italy has recently been doing its utmost to maintain Austria's integrity and independence in order to prevent Austria's friendliness with the National Socialist Party. Yugoslavia, because Austria wants to revise the Treaty of Trianon, is therefore allied with Germany to restrain Austria. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>(Washington) After months of contention between President Roosevelt and congressional silver advocates over the silver issue, a bill agreed upon by both sides has finally been reached. The White House issued a formal statement today stating that the President and silver advocates have reached an agreement, and the President will submit a special message to Congress within one or two days. It is understood that the message will propose improvements to the monetary system, and the legislation will be issued in a commanding style, with both approval and authorization elements. Silver-supporting senators are jubilant about the outcome of this White House meeting. Senator Pittman said that there is no misunderstanding on the silver bill issue, and the bill can be drafted immediately. According to reliable sources, the proposed silver bill will stipulate the following: (1) silver will be declared as currency in a commanding manner, and it will be stipulated that silver accounts for 25% of the reserves and gold accounts for 75%; (2) the Treasury Department will be authorized and directed to purchase silver until the price of silver reaches US$1.29 per ounce, or silver accounts for 25% of the total reserves; (3) the President will be authorized to nationalize silver. It is worth noting that the proposed silver bill does not bind the President to purchase silver. President Roosevelt also expressed his hope to submit a special message on war debts to Congress next week, but the President may not handle the war debt issue together with the silver issue. The debtor side declared that the proposed silver bill will stipulate that silver coins will be used as reserves to issue silver vouchers, with a ratio of US$1.29 per ounce. If the price per ounce is less than this amount, the difference will become the profit of the Treasury Department. It is estimated that 1,800,000,000 ounces of silver are needed to meet the 25% of total reserves. Well-informed sources claim that it is impossible to obtain such a huge amount.

<p>San Francisco. Approximately 7,000 merchant sailors have joined the dockworkers' strike, with 37 ships in the port of Seattle unable to depart because they have not unloaded their cargo. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>San Francisco. The Pacific Coast Seamen's Union decided today to express sympathy for the dockworkers' strike, which will completely paralyze Pacific shipping. Thousands of sailors and seamen in San Francisco and three thousand in other cities will join the strike. Other labor groups related to the shipping industry are also preparing to participate in the strike movement and have refused to handle ship cargo. Dockworkers have also expressed the same sentiment, and the situation is extremely concerning. Since the strike began a week ago, three people have died and nearly a hundred have been injured. Striking workers have repeatedly clashed with police. Dockworkers in ports in Baja California and workers along the Atlantic coast have also gone on strike, and it is feared that this unrest will soon expand to American ships overseas, although this is prohibited by law. Mail shipping companies are suffering losses of thousands of dollars every day, as many ships are stuck in port and cannot depart. Although mail shipping companies have offered high wages to workers and provided protection, the effect has been minimal. Fifty-two shipping companies in Portland and other places have temporarily suspended operations, and ships are congested in the port waiting to be unloaded. In San Francisco alone, thirty cargo ships are fully loaded but immobile. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>

<p>Khabarovsk. On May 12, the Manchurian ship "Kiken" sailed up the Heilongjiang River to the mouth of the Bitzhuang River (near the confluence of the Songhua River and the Heilongjiang River). When it approached the Soviet shore, personnel on board openly photographed and surveyed the Soviet riverbank and the area along the bank. The Soviet border guard post was located there. The border guard saw this action and signaled the ship to stop. The ship did not listen, and they fired three blank shots as a warning. However, the ship continued to cruise along the Soviet border. The border guards again signaled the ship to stop for the same reason, but this action was still ineffective. The ship continued to move forward as before. According to current regulations, the border guard had sufficient reason to use all available weapons to force the ship to stop. However, the guards only fired a few shots into the air, passing over the ship's smokestack. Afterwards, the ship sailed towards the Chinese shore. (TASS News Agency, 16th)</p>

President Roosevelt also stated to members of both houses during the meeting that he wants the strict provisions of 45% margin in the bill passed by the House. The key points of this bill are: (1) all securities exchanges must register with the Federal Trade Commission; (2) the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to stipulate the minimum margin, with the margin being 45% in normal times; (3) any manipulation that can create artificial prices is prohibited. The House Agriculture Committee recently voted to apply this plan to cotton and grain transactions. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Professor Gu Kovsky, a Soviet Russian surgeon, recently discovered a new abdominal dissection surgery, which he believes can save many lives. Mr. Gu Kovsky has been researching for many years and feels that most patients die because they cannot eat after abdominal dissection. Therefore, when Professor Gu first experimented, he planned to remedy this method. Before the dissection, he infused food into the intestines. This food is a nutritious "breakfast" such as butter, eggs, and milk. This nutritious food is sufficient to increase the patient's resistance, and can reduce the patient's mortality rate from 16% to 4.1% on average. Afterwards, light and soft nutritious foods are supplied to the patient before surgery, and then the patient can undergo local surgery. (National News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Zhiyou, Chairman of the Yangtze River Regulation Committee, departed from Wusongkou on the Lijiang ship to inspect the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and arrived in Nanjing. According to reports, the purpose of this inspection was to survey from Wusong, Chongming, Nantong, Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, to Nanjing. The collapse in the Langshan area is very dangerous, so personnel were sent to the area to conduct surveys and plan for proposed repairs. The collapse in this section is not extremely dangerous, and although repairs are necessary, no accidents should occur even if they are not carried out temporarily. However, the changes in the waterway from Langshan to Wusong are a serious problem. The section is fifty miles long, but the waterway has not changed. When Yangtze River merchant ships travel to this area, they dare not sail at night because the turning points of the changes are short and folded. Even a moment of carelessness can lead to grounding. This section of the waterway is constantly monitored by ships sent by the competent authorities, such as the Customs and Hydrographic Survey Bureau, to explore the waterway, so no dangers have been reported. Currently, when ships reach Langshan, they are afraid to sail and wait until dawn before raising anchor. The losses of this kind of company and passengers are considerable. Therefore, this regulation work is extremely important. 1. Starting from the upstream is the fundamental solution. 2. Further regulate the collapse on both banks of the downstream and build water barriers. After these two things are done, the water coming from the upstream can flow straight out, and the waterway will not change at any time. The council is currently organizing a downstream river management committee. After it is established and starts working, the waterway can gradually be stabilized. The siltation on the Zhenjiang riverbank is very serious, and the Jianglun ships cannot approach the pier. The council has also formulated a plan and requested the Jiangsu Provincial Government to regulate it within the possible scope. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e107">A Painful Plea to the Motherland from Compatriots of the Northeast, Written in Blood and Tears <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>A Profound Lament on National Subjugation</p>
<p>Each Word a Tear, Worthy of Lament and Praise</p>
<p>Recently, a person from the Northeast secretly carried a letter to the fathers and elders of the nation from suffering compatriots in the Northeast. It recounts the pain of suffering national subjugation, earnestly hopes that the motherland will strive for strength, work together harmoniously to avoid the Northeast's fate, and even take further steps to recover lost territory. The letter is earnest, each word a tear, truly unbearable to finish reading. How should we, the people of the nation, strive to save the country, so as not to fail the earnest hopes of the suffering compatriots in the Northeast? The document is recorded below:</p>
<p>Alas, fathers and elders of the nation! Since our four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have been successively seized by the Japanese invaders, we feel like rabbits mourning the death of foxes, or things mourning the loss of their kind. Moreover, the bloodshed in Shanghai and the exposure of bones at the Great Wall, and the repeated harassment of Peiping and Tientsin, have caused our fathers and elders in the past two years to experience anxieties in their food, clothing, shelter, daily life, and mental state that cannot be described in words. So, why are we telling you this? Moreover, enduring humiliation to live under the trampling iron heel of Japan, unable to rise up, how can we have the face to look up to the fathers and elders of the country, raise our heads, and voice our opinions? However, the blind do not forget sight, and the lame do not forget walking. Being blind and lame is not what we wanted. Only because we are already blind and lame do we not want others to become blind and lame again. This is why we do not consider ourselves unsightly and tearfully offer sincere words to the fathers and elders of the nation. If we can continue with this great and thorough awakening, pool our wisdom and efforts, prepare in advance, and unite to resist foreign aggression, we can not only save ourselves from the disaster of being blinded and having our feet cut off, but also hope to rescue these blind and lame compatriots who have not forgotten sight and walking, and die returning to our ancestors. As the saying goes, "Learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones."</p>
<p>Speaking of our four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, in terms of territory, they are several times larger than the entire country of Japan. Counting the number of invaders who seized our Northeast, it was initially no more than ten thousand, while the population of our four northeastern provinces is as high as thirty-six million. Among them, the so-called formal army is no less than three hundred thousand strong. No matter how bad or insufficient our weapons and ammunition may be, if we had the heart and preparation to resist foreign aggression on normal days, then when the incident occurred, not to mention the formal army, even our thirty million people would have made it impossible for the Japanese invaders to use their strong armor and sharp weapons. As for the Battle of Rehe, if our troops had planned to throw their weapons on the main roads into Rehe to create obstacles, it would have taken the Japanese invaders several days to transport them away before they could occupy Chengde. There is absolutely no way it could have fallen as easily and quickly as it did. Therefore, Japan's current occupation of our Northeast is absolutely not due to the strength of its soldiers and the precision of its weapons. It is really because we had no heart or preparation to resist foreign aggression beforehand. This was an unexpected gain for Japan, which it initially did not expect. Now that it has obtained it, it will definitely do its best to manage it as its vast resource. However, giving an inch, they will take a mile. This is not related to personnel, but is the norm of the situation. Moreover, it was obtained easily and without any cost. Furthermore, international competition is becoming increasingly tense, and the environment forces them not to restrict themselves. This is why the Japanese invaders will take more planned steps to seize our North China. According to what we have heard and know, in the past two years, they have only used means of instigation, disturbance, making a big deal out of a small issue, and intimidation towards North China. Their main purpose is to use various forms of coercion to make our China first recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo. If the Manchukuo state they created cannot be recognized internationally, their management will be rootless, and at the very least, it will be resented by various countries. Therefore, for the past two years, they have spared no expense on publicity, liaison, and other expenses in Europe and the United States to seek recognition, but so far, there have been no tangible results. As a result, they have changed their strategy and decided to start with our China, because Chinese traitors can be lured with benefits, and the authorities can be threatened. They also know that our China cannot openly recognize it. Therefore, they raise negotiations on minor matters such as the exchange of trains and mail. If we refuse to accept them, they will accuse us of lacking sincerity and violating the spirit of the Tanggu Truce. If we accept these negotiations and establish some kind of agreement, they will recognize that our China has de facto recognition of Manchukuo, and will use this to further promote their cause and liaise with various countries, so that various countries have no excuse to refuse and there is no need to insist on the resolution of not recognizing Manchukuo. This is why they are so preoccupied with the issue of train and mail services and will not stop until they achieve it. Otherwise, since the September 18th Incident until today, the traffic inside and outside the customs has not stopped, especially for Japan, there is absolutely no obstacle. Why do they have to make such a resolute demand to us? We in the Northeast live in prison every day, like prisoners. This is not like the Japanese propaganda, the so-called paradise. Usually, we are always uneasy, not knowing when we will be framed by villains and suddenly thrown into prison. Even if we are released, our frightened souls are still uneasy. Therefore, although our bodies are under the violent trampling of the Japanese invaders every day, our hearts are always thinking of our entire country and the spirits of our Yellow Emperor ancestors in heaven. Therefore, regarding Japan's conspiracy, if we know anything, we must secretly report it. If we see anything, we must report it based on what we see. In our humble opinion, the issue of train and mail services is a small matter, but its impact is very large. Do not be lured or threatened by them and give them recognition or some kind of disguised agreement. No matter what form, once an agreement is established, not only will it not prevent the fall of North China, but it will also lead to the disaster of partitioning. At that time, various countries will believe that what Japan is publicizing is true. Regarding China, even if they do not want to believe that it does not have the qualifications to establish a country, they cannot. Since it is not enough to support and promote it, they can only adopt the principle of equal distribution of benefits. Indeed, when weighing two benefits, take the greater; when weighing two harms, take the lesser. They will partition China with Japan without the cost of losing arrows or broken arrows. If they restrict Japan for China, there is a risk of corpses and bloodshed. Regarding the advantages and disadvantages of this, people in Europe and the United States should not have any doubts. This is why we dare to assert that it will definitely lead to the disaster of partitioning. At that time, it is not known which country our fathers and elders will belong to, and the people of our four northeastern provinces will forever be slaves of Japanese slaves. Alas, how miserable!</p>
<p>Assuming that we firmly do not recognize the train and mail services, will North China not be in danger? Saying yes and no, it is inevitable that Japan will cause disturbances in North China. However, according to its plan and certain steps, and the strategies adopted for various countries, there will definitely be no immediate deployment of large armies to occupy North China. If Japan believes that occupying North China now is beneficial, then there would be no Tanggu Truce at all. The Tanggu Truce was not Japan being in a passive position or the success of our diplomatic negotiations, but Japan's policy of weighing the pros and cons and slightly slowing down its offensive against China. How can our diplomacy of seeking peace, begging for mercy, and holding our breath to listen to orders turn its fierce edge? Those who take the Tanggu Truce as a symbol of turning the crisis in North China into safety are shameless, and our life of stealing life and living in the Northeast is truly comparable to Lu and Wei. Furthermore, if we do not promise their train and mail services, they will occupy North China, and we will only have to do our best to resist. If we cannot resist, it is better to have it forcibly occupied like our Northeast than to recognize it and lose our diplomatic position, cut off the chance of recovery, and give various countries an excuse to partition it. Moreover, judging from their China policy, they do not have the determination to actively occupy North China at this time. Our fathers and elders should take this opportunity to prepare for resistance. Do not be afraid because it is coming and sit and wait for death. Do not be negligent because it has not yet arrived and do not prepare at all. During the September 18th Incident, the soldiers and civilians of our four northeastern provinces, both above and below, were suffering from this disease. This is why we today endure humiliation and do not avoid danger to enter the customs and present our foolishness to the fathers and elders of the nation.</p>
<p>If our fathers and elders do not discard words because of the person, and even more pity their urgency to prepare, silently organize, and mend the fold after the sheep is lost, it is not too late. Ten years ago, the environment of Italy, the Soviet Union, Germany, and other countries was several times worse than our country today. Only because they were able to unite and fight, they not only got out of trouble but also jumped up and became respected by the world. If our fathers and elders can abandon the prejudices of individualism and temporarily adopt a consistent attitude towards foreign countries, Heaven helps those who help themselves, and victory will surely be achieved. We are not just hoping for the fathers and elders and resigning ourselves to slavery. If this were the case, we would not have said these painful words to the fathers and elders. If we are asked why we do not rise up and fight immediately or all enter the customs to show our resistance, then it is a harsh demand. We are ashamed that before the September 18th Incident, we failed to prepare in advance and organize. When the disaster occurred, we responded in a hurry and were unable to accomplish anything. However, the spirit of unyielding has already been clearly demonstrated to the world by the three words "Volunteer Army." Now, if we want to solve the Northeast problem, it is not something that we can do alone. We must all have the determination to implement complete unity, act in unison, and wait for a suitable opportunity, so that we can recover it in one fell swoop. As for why we cannot all enter the customs, it is a matter of fact that is not allowed, not that we do not want to.</p>
<p>For the few Northeast intellectuals or those with considerable status who enter the customs, the country has no way to arrange for them, resulting in some being forced by life to go back and be heavily insulted by the Japanese. This is what we in the Northeast are most saddened and disappointed about. Not to mention that we are attached to our homeland and difficult for the old and weak to support, making it difficult to implement a scorched-earth policy. Even if it were implemented, does the country have a way to arrange for the thirty-six million people? If so, letting the land be inhabited by Japanese and Korean farmers is what Japan desires most. Therefore, we are forced by life to stay in the Northeast, or some may serve in the so-called Manchukuo, but they should not all be regarded as traitors and collaborators. Most of them hope to find an opportunity to repay China. This must be examined carefully. And at the very least, the country should not drive away the sparrows in droves. Therefore, for all the Northeast people who are now living in the customs, some are our fathers and brothers, and some are our sons and brothers, wandering like homeless dogs. Our country and the fathers and elders of North China should have pity and comfort them. Do not despise or exclude them because they have lost their provinces and homes, making them feel attacked from both inside and outside. This is what we especially entrust to the fathers and elders of the nation. Alas, fathers and elders, separated by a customs, we are close yet far apart. Raising our heads in the Central Plains, we have no tears to wipe away. One day, when you see fighters holding the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Whole Earth, coming to shake our hands, you should know that our fathers and elders have worked hard and succeeded.</p>

<p>Immigrate Three Million People in Twenty Years</p>
<p>Organize a Joint Japanese-Puppet Immigration Company</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The first step of Japan's plan to invade and occupy our Northeast has already achieved its goal. The second step of the plan is immigration, planning to immigrate three million people to the Northeast in twenty years. At present, it is proceeding steadily and without any relaxation. The Japanese Kwantung Army's Special Service Department has also ordered the puppet government to cooperate, ostensibly with both sides jointly establishing an immigration company. This plan was taken to Tokyo by Umetani, the immigration minister of the Japanese Kwantung Army's Special Service Department, for consultation with the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and other relevant parties. It has been approved and encouraged by the Japanese government. The main points of the plan are: (1) The Manchuria Immigration Company will be jointly operated by Japan and the puppet government. (2) The capital is 20 million yuan, with the puppet country contributing 10 million yuan and Japan contributing 10 million yuan. (3) One million families will be moved within twenty years. The resettlement locations are mainly centered on the Hu-Hai and Zhai-Ke railways, relocating to the northeastern part of the puppet country. (4) Each family will have three members as a unit. (5) Each Japanese family relocating to puppet Manchuria will receive a government subsidy of 4,000 yuan in immigration fees.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the collapse of Tailihe Company, which sold Guangdong salt in Hunan, after the absconding of responsible persons Zhao Jingshan and Wang Shaomu, the entire province's salt industry was affected. At the same time, government tax revenue was also significantly impacted. Because salt tax is a major source of national tax revenue, the company's collapse notwithstanding, future salt operations and tax payments must be actively maintained. Therefore, the salt industry and the Salt Transport Envoy's Office held repeated meetings to discuss methods to maintain the salt business. After official and commercial parties decided, starting from the 10th of this month, it was announced that the Tailihe Company would be abolished and replaced by the Joint Office Committee for the Transport and Sale of Salt in Southern Hunan, organized by the Guangzhou City Xiahe Salt Industry Association, the Tailihe Company Creditors' Group, and Tailihe Company shareholders. Each party will send five representatives, totaling fifteen members as the committee. All Guangdong salt transported to Hunan and the payment of unified taxes will be handled by this new organization. A Tailihe Company Account Clearing Committee will also be formed. The debts owed by Tailihe to outsiders and the accounts owed to them will be verified, recovered, and repaid by the Clearing Committee. The new merchants' salt tax amount will still be the previous 85,000 yuan per month (the original unified tax was 100,000 yuan, but due to sluggish salt sales in southern Hunan, it was approved to reduce it by 15,000 yuan per month). However, now it is the off-season, and from April to July, only 60,000 yuan can be sold each month. August is the peak season, at which time it can be made up for. New merchants will resume business and allocation from the 10th. In the future, taxes will be paid monthly without delay. The former company owed more than 300,000 yuan in taxes for April, and 1 million yuan in promissory notes borrowed before the year, including principal and interest. New merchants will be allowed to impose an additional five jiao per bag of salt, which will be repaid by the Clearing Committee in installments until it is paid off. It is estimated that it can be repaid in one year or a year and a half. After the new merchants take over, Tailihe Company has also been closed. All previous expenses have been greatly reduced. The former three detachments of salt police on the North River have now been reduced to one detachment. Offices in various places have also reduced office expenses. The transportation routes still enter southern Hunan in two ways: one through the North River and one through the West River, passing through Guangxi. Currently, there are 32 counties in the area selling Guangdong salt in southern Hunan, but the sales market is weaker than before. The current market price of salt is about five to six yuan per bag (12th).</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway to traffic, there has been a constant flow of vehicles in and out. Trees are planted on both sides of the road to embellish the scenery. The seawalls in Caoging, Zhaolin, and Jinshanwei in this county are the necessary places for the National Highway to pass. The Provincial Department of Construction specially notified the county government that the Beijing-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Jurong, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Suzhou-Jiaxing four roads will hold the Southeast Touring Exhibition in June. At that time, Chairman Chiang will personally participate. The Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway is also within the ring line. For the section of the National Highway passing through the county, if the branches of the trees planted on both sides are withered, they should be pruned immediately. If there are any missing trees, they should be quickly replanted to enhance the view. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Jin instructed patrol officer Li Yihua to be responsible for handling it and to submit a report.</p>

<p>The two wanted bandits of this county, Lu Maoping and Wang Jinyue, colluded in July last year to confiscate two rifles from the Yong'an Bridge Security Team of the Fourth District and robbed the house of Fan Chongwen in the same district, killing Fan Chongwen, his wife, and Fan Chengqing. The county government has been strictly searching for them without success. A few days ago, the two criminals Lu and Wang were arrested by the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters in Shanghai for endangering the Republic of China. After interrogation by the headquarters, it was deemed necessary to summon the family members of the victim Fan Chongwen. Yesterday, they specially checked and sent summons and sent a letter to the county government of this county, ordering the police to summon Fan Huangshi, Fan Chenglong, and Fan Qizhen to the headquarters for questioning in order to handle the case according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Kunshan: Lujia Port to Build a Large Factory <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Huang Hongjun, the general manager of the Shanghai China Underwear Company, purchased 400 mu of land along the Wusong River in Lujia Port Town, the Autonomous Experiment Zone of this county, and prepared to raise 3 million yuan to build a large factory such as a fine yarn dyeing factory to resist the dumping of foreign goods. It is now learned that the district chief of the district, Zhu Wenyuan, and local gentry and landlords are making every effort to mediate, and all negotiations have been completed. Yesterday (the 14th), Mr. Huang came to Lu and paid the land price at the district office and signed the contract. Construction will begin after the tombs are cleaned.</p>

<p>In recent years, the rural economy has gone bankrupt, resulting in sluggishness in all industries, and the failure of silk factories is especially unbearable. Since the beginning of spring, only a dozen or so factories have started up, but silk sales are sluggish, making it difficult to maintain them. With a shortage of capital, silk factories have had the phenomenon of owing wages. The county government of this county has specially stipulated provisional measures for prohibiting rented silk factories, in order to prevent speculative silk factories. After being approved by the provincial government for implementation, it is now found that among the factories that have started operation in this county, except for Huaxin, Jinji, Yongtai, Longchang, Yongsheng, Yongji, Ganshen, and Gantai, which have built their own factory buildings and installed silk reeling machines, the remaining Dechang, Yuji, Dacheng, Qingfengsheng, Qingyu, Xinyi, and Hefeng are all rented. It is inevitable that they will be stretched thin with this method. Yesterday, they gathered to discuss countermeasures and decided to first send a letter to the Silk Factory Association, forwarding it to the county government, requesting them to consider the difficulties of the merchants renting factories and to withdraw the order, and to postpone the provisional measures for prohibiting rented silk factories. Once business turns around and the economy is slightly better, they will follow the measures to maintain the livelihood of tens of thousands of workers.</p>

<p>The Fushan Pond of this county was previously difficult for boats to pass through due to the accumulation of tidal mud. The dredging association allocated funds for dredging, which started on the first day of last month. Later, the person in charge was changed, and the weather was not sunny, so it was extended to the middle of this month and had not been completed. However, recently, it is the peak season of the Fushan yellow croaker market, and those who rely on the passage of ships through the Fushan Pond are very eager, and the farmland along the pond also needs irrigation. Therefore, they requested the authorities to speed up the completion of the project. The Provincial Department of Construction specially sent technician Gao Zhongyuan to Changshu to inspect and accept the project. He went to inspect on the 14th and believed that the bottom of the river and the surface of the river did not meet the original plan and would not be accepted. Later, the authorities increased wages and ordered to rush the excavation. The project was completed at noon on the 17th, and it was decided to break the dam at 5:00 PM that afternoon when the tide rises, so that ships can pass through.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Fire at Canghai Temple</p>
<p>The Canghai Temple, one of the four major monasteries on the top of Yushan Mountain in this county, was destroyed by fire after the Shangyi incense offering. All the essence of the temple was lost, and the loss was not small. It is not easy to repair the temple now. Monk Zhiguang intends to raise funds for reconstruction in order to protect the ancient temple of Yushan. It is now learned that there are more than 400 incense societies in the temple. Zhiguang plans to summon the heads of the societies to gather on the mountain to discuss aftermath measures.</p>

<p>Two sailing ships from Yixing Heqiao and Qitingqiao to Changzhou set sail one after another in the town on the 15th and anchored overnight at Wantazhen in Changjing. At dawn on the 16th, the two ships continued to sail at the same time. Unexpectedly, when passing through the Shiwudong Bridge area about three miles from the town, a small boat suddenly sailed towards them and ordered them to dock. The boat crew docked in the river, and then more than a dozen bandits jumped onto the ship and searched wantonly in the two ships. None of the passengers on the ship were spared. At that time, two passengers resisted and were shot and injured. All the goods in the ship were robbed. Afterwards, the ship still sailed to Changzhou. The shipping association reported to the county government to arrest the bandits.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Department found that the scientific spiritual divination charts that have been popular in the city recently have a wide sales volume. After investigating its content, it is actually promoting spiritual divination and superstition in the name of science. It is already similar to what wizards and alchemists do, and its instructions are even more absurd and unbelievable. Regardless of the fact that today's natural sciences such as psychology, physiology, and anatomy are flourishing and progressing, the consciousness and spiritual phenomena of human beings can be explained by natural sciences, and the theory of the so-called soul is fundamentally untenable. Moreover, at a time when we are advocating the popularization of scientific knowledge among the people and the New Life Movement, it is not appropriate to let it spread widely. It is reported that in addition to the provincial government ordering bookstores to be prohibited from selling the charts, the provincial party department has also ordered the county party departments to cooperate with the local government to strictly ban them in order to prevent the spread of superstition.</p>

<p>The customs of Pinghu are extremely simple and honest, but recently young people have become accustomed to vanity, and the ethos has changed drastically. There are not a few rural girls who are trafficked abroad and forced into prostitution in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, when the train from Pinghu to Shanghai was about to depart, there was a girl in front of the railway station who looked flustered and as if she was waiting for someone. It happened to be seen by the police officer on duty there, who stepped forward to question her. She claimed to be surnamed Chen, living in Ximen in the city, and was about to go to Zha with her brother for sightseeing. When asked where her brother was, she said he was sipping tea in a nearby teahouse. The police officer ordered her to prove it. The girl pointed to a pockmarked man and said it was him. The police officer questioned him about his surname. He claimed to be named Zhou Mingxiang and said that the girl was a neighbor, and they were going to Shanghai together. The police officer suspected that there was a case of abduction because the words of both parties did not match. They were detained at the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>In the Sifanggang area of the Sixth District of this county, Jiang Weifu, the son of Jiang Yushu, was teaching at the house of Liu Gukun in the Liu family compound. On the night of April 26, Weifu suddenly disappeared. Yesterday, his father hired a boat to Funing to look for him. When passing through the Xiaoyaowan area, he saw a section of a corpse on the Chai beach next to a broken tomb, as well as two human legs and one human arm. He went to the corpse to identify it carefully and confirmed that it was the body of his son. The remaining head and arm have not yet been found. The cause of death is rumored to be due to adultery. He has already reported the case to the county government yesterday. The county government has now sent personnel to the site to investigate along with a scribe.</p>

<p>The material warehouse in the gatehouse at No. 32 and No. 34, Xiaojingtou, Baoji Guan Lane, Hangzhou City, was opened by resident Tong Huixing, and the business was quite good. At 1:40 AM on the 16th, a sudden fire broke out due to carelessness. Neighbors were awakened from their dreams and rushed to rescue. However, the fire was fierce. After the fire brigade and others tried their best to put out the fire, it was extinguished after burning for about two hours. It is estimated that two gatehouses and three flat halls were burned, with a loss of more than 4,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Ding Qiuzhen, the leader of the Phoenix Mosque in Hangzhou City, submitted a request to the provincial government to award an honorary plaque to Li Fangxiao, a Henan native and leader residing in the temple, because he is well-versed in health preservation and is now 112 years old and still has light hands and feet, which can be called a human auspicious sign. The provincial government ordered the municipal government to verify that it was true. Yesterday, the province issued a plaque with the four characters "Luo Zhong Yuan Shuang" and ordered the municipal government to hand it over to the recipient.</p>

<p>Our country's Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable line was previously entrusted to the Great Northern and Great Eastern Telegraph Companies for management. Telegrams transmitted via this submarine cable could also be entrusted to the submarine cable telegraph offices for collection and delivery. From the 20th of this month, the Ministry of Transportation will take back the submarine cable for self-management. All telegrams between Shanghai and various places in North China, which are transmitted via the Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable, will be received and delivered by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency specially investigated and reported the following yesterday:</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable line was installed by the Great Northern and Great Eastern Companies during the Boxer Rebellion in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty without the consent of our government. The value is estimated to be several million yuan. After our discovery and negotiation, we offered to buy it back. Before the payment was cleared, the companies temporarily managed it. The payment was deducted from the cable fee payable to the Ministry of Transportation on time, with a contract period of 30 years. After one extension, it expired on May 20th of this year. All payments have been fully paid. The Ministry of Transportation specifically cabled the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's submarine cable engineers to take charge and implement the recovery of management rights from the companies at 12:00 pm on the 19th. From 1:00 am on the 20th, all telegrams sent and received on the line will be fully negotiated and handled by the company.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, after inspecting the financial situation in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, left Beijing by night train for Shanghai on the night before last. He arrived at the Zhenru Station at 7:25 am yesterday and went directly to his private residence on West Yanan Road to rest. At noon, he went to the Central Bank to work. At 5:00 pm, he met with reporters from various newspapers at the Central Bank. Kong will return to Beijing within a few days to preside over the National Financial Conference. The following is a record of Kong's remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Financial Situation in Four Provinces Has Improved <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to Kong, during his visit to the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, he inspected the financial situation in each province. When passing through Anhui, he injured his foot due to carelessness. After arriving in Jiangxi, he immediately met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He discussed in detail the matters concerning the suppression of bandits and the various issues of the National Economic Council. He also discussed inviting five experts from the Economic Council's Health and Highway departments to discuss the future work progress. After arriving in Wuhan, he met with Zhang Hanqing and inspected the financial revenue and expenditure situation in Hubei Province. He then accepted the invitation of Chairman He of Hunan Province and flew to Hunan to meet with him for a short stay before returning to Wuhan. He then took the Customs Maritime Star patrol ship and returned to Beijing with Rogers, an American silver expert. During the journey, he exchanged detailed opinions on silver with Rogers on the ship. Although the inspection trip only covered the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, he believes that the financial situation in these four provinces has greatly improved compared to the past. As for the current revenue and expenditure situation in the four provinces, Hubei and Hunan can balance their revenue and expenditure. Anhui Province feels a slight shortage due to the expenses of the security corps. Jiangxi is in a special environment, and of course, revenue cannot meet expenditure.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Rectification Measures Will Be Submitted to the Assembly <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>As for the rectification of the finances of various provinces, Kong believes that this issue is very broad and cannot be resolved in a few words. However, in a nutshell, to rectify the finances of various provinces, we must first understand the financial situation of each province. There is no denying that the finances of each province urgently need rectification. Even the central government's finances urgently need rectification. The rectification strategy should also be determined according to the environment of each province. For example, the collection of land tax in Hubei Province is not calculated by the acre, but by the amount of grain sown per field. And there is no reliable survey of the amount of grain sown. This situation must be reformed immediately. This issue will be discussed at the National Financial Conference, which will open on the 21st of this month. Kong himself has decided to go to Beijing to preside over the meeting before the conference. Financial authorities from various provinces and cities have flocked to Beijing to attend.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Suma Visits Kong, Does Not Discuss Foreign Debt <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to Kong, the Japanese Consul in Beijing, Suma, visited him in Beijing on the 16th as a routine courtesy visit. He inquired about his recent trip to various provinces and his health. The issue of foreign debt was never mentioned. The report that Suma's visit was to discuss the reorganization of foreign debt is not accurate. If the Japanese side wants to request the reorganization of foreign debt, there are responsible personnel to directly contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There is no need for Suma to discuss with him. Moreover, there is a committee for reorganizing domestic and foreign debt. Therefore, the rumors are not true.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Construction Company is Entirely Chinese-Owned <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Kong also said that the capital of the Construction Bank is entirely Chinese-owned. However, if a large amount of capital is needed in the future for investment, foreign capital can be absorbed under appropriate conditions. As for the rumor that the French person Monna has colluded with the Japanese to invest in the Construction Company, it is not accurate. Kong then answered reporters' questions, saying that the exact date of Lassiman's visit to China is still undecided. The rumor that Liu Zhi, chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, will be transferred to chairman of Hunan Province is even more unfounded.</p>

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is using funds borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to build four new Hai Class ships in England. We have now received a telegram from the construction supervisor Wu Daming and others, stating that all four new ships can be completed and leave the factory this year to sail to Shanghai. The company has appointed technicians and marine engineers to go to England for practical training, and they will set sail tomorrow afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Two Shipyards Undertake Construction <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Because all four new Hai Class ships must be completed this year, two ships are being built by Swan Hunnfer &amp; Wigham Richardsou in London, England, and two ships are also being built by Barclay Curled &amp; C in Glasgow, Scotland. Construction by two shipyards will be faster. It was initially heard that two ships would be completed first this year. Now, according to the telegram from the construction supervisor, the two shipyards are stepping up construction, and the four new ships are scheduled to be fully completed and arrive in Shanghai within the year.</p>
<h3 id="e134">All Arrive Within the Year <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Haiyuan and Haiheng ships will be completed simultaneously in mid-November of this year and sail to Shanghai. Therefore, ship owners Ma Jiajun and Teng Shibiao, who were appointed by the company, will go to England in August to escort the two new ships to Shanghai. The Haili and Haizhen ships will be completed a month later, so they can also arrive in Shanghai in late December. The crew and captains of these four new ships will be appointed after they arrive. The business section has decided to abolish the contract system and appoint a purser to report and reimburse expenses to the company.</p>

<p>Because the machinery and engines of the four new ships being built in England are all new models, the company first sent technician Huang Zonglun, chief engineer Zhang Guoquan, marine engineers Shi Ruichang and Li Changwen, and Zhou Yanjin and Wang Chengzhu, graduates of the marine engineering program at the Wusong Merchant Marine School. It is the first time that a Chinese shipping company has sent technical personnel to foreign shipyards to learn about marine engineering. Therefore, Liu Hongsheng, general manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, hosted a banquet at his residence at 6:00 pm the day before yesterday to bid farewell to the six men. Zhao Yuntai and Zhou Houkun, heads of the shipbuilding department, were also invited to attend. During the banquet, they were encouraged to pay attention to the technology of the new machinery. Although the practical training time is not long, they will become the company's basic technical experts when they return to China with the ships in the future. Department heads Zhao and Zhou also made encouraging remarks.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Set Sail Tomorrow Afternoon <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Huang Zonglun and the others have all completed their original duties (shipbuilding technician, director of the inland shipping factory) and handed them over to Mr. Zhang, who will act on their behalf. Zhang Guoquan has also relinquished his duties as chief engineer of the Jiahe ship. All procedures have been completed. The accounting department has also purchased British and French currency on their behalf. All procedures were completed yesterday. Ship tickets were purchased on the French postal ship Xidaosis No. 2, which is scheduled to board the ship at noon tomorrow and leave Shanghai at 2:00 pm in the afternoon.

<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Panchen Lama presided over the Kalachakra Vajra Dharma Assembly in Hangzhou and was welcomed by a group of men and women believers. Now that the Dharma Assembly has been successfully concluded, Shanghai philanthropists, such as Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng, have all invited him to visit Shanghai. The Panchen Lama has agreed. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency learned yesterday that the Panchen Lama will arrive in Shanghai this morning with his disciples, accompanied by Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, by car. If it rains, they may take the train instead. It is expected to arrive at noon. At that time, various Buddhist and charitable organizations in Shanghai and various municipal government agencies will go to welcome him and prepare a grand welcome ceremony. According to the person in charge of the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly, the Panchen Lama's visit to Shanghai is at the invitation of the charitable community. Rumors that another Dharma Assembly will be held in Shanghai are completely unfounded.</p>

<p>After visiting the receiving equipment, it was noon. Wen Yuqing, director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, hosted a Western-style meal at the Cathay Hotel. At 3:00 pm, they attended a tea party held by the China Cultural Construction Association at the Shanghai United Association of the Silk Industry Bank Building. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 pm, and they returned to their accommodation to rest and pack their luggage. The entire group left Shanghai for Beijing on the night express train at 11:00 pm to visit the new construction of the capital and then go to Jiangxi to pay respects to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>The group spent a total of three days inspecting Shanghai. According to their impressions of Shanghai before leaving, due to the limited time, it was difficult to fully observe the vast Shanghai. They may have another opportunity to visit Shanghai when they return south in the future. The most profound and painful impression of the three days of visiting Shanghai was the desolate Zhabei Jiangwan area after being ravaged by the enemy, the remnants of the war zone. Shanghai's cultural undertakings do have a considerable new atmosphere, and the transportation industry has also made considerable progress, which is unmatched by South China. As for Shanghai's news industry, due to the relatively abundant material conditions, the equipment and technology are naturally in a leading position in the national press. However, shortcomings are also unavoidable, but with the strictness of its organization and the efforts of those engaged in journalism to improve in this area, the future development should have unlimited hope.</p>

<p>In recent years, the export of Chinese tea to foreign markets has been declining due to poor quality and the dumping of Indian and Ceylon tea. British and American countries have almost abandoned it. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in view of this, is actively engaged in inspection and improvement, and cooperates with tea merchants in producing areas to organize cooperatives. Regarding the black tea from Ningzhou, Qimen, and other places, the foreign firm Jinlong Yangxing in Shanghai is very appreciative and is willing to send it to London for promotion. As for the Pingshui green tea in Zhejiang, a letter from New York states that the Pingshui tea is terrible and unacceptable to customers. If it is not actively improved, it will disappear. The details are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e147">Establishing Improvement Farms <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry believes that the quality of China's exported tea has been declining year by year, resulting in a continuous decline in export volume and sales price. If improvements are not made, there will be no foothold in international trade. Therefore, in addition to actively engaging in inspection work, it has recently paid special attention to improving the quality of tea in various regions. It has also cooperated with the Department of Construction of Anhui Province to operate Qimen Tea Improvement Farms and organized many production and sales cooperatives in order to reduce costs. In addition, it has jointly established a tea industry improvement farm in Ningzhou with the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry and the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry. The newly produced black tea from the farm this year is of exceptionally high quality and can compete with Indian and Ceylon black tea. A Hankou foreign firm offered 120 yuan (the market price of ordinary Ningzhou black tea is only 60-70 yuan). If it can be gradually improved, tea merchants can obtain great benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Willing to Promote <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Jinlong Yangxing sent a letter to the bureau yesterday, expressing its willingness to send the black tea to London for promotion as advertising. The original letter stated: "To the Executive Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, we are deeply grateful for the three types of Ningzhou black tea that you have jointly produced at the tea improvement farm. We congratulate you on producing such good tea. Do you have this tea available now? What is the quantity? We believe that our company can ship several boxes each of this imitation Ceylon black tea and the other two types to London and sell them at the tea public auction as advertising for Chinese tea. Our company is confident that the goods can be sold at a good price. This proves that if tea farmers in the interior can carefully produce tea, they can get high rewards."</p>
<h3 id="e149">Letter from New York <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The United States has a very large demand for green tea. Pingshui tea from various counties in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, is a major commodity sold in the United States. However, in recent years, the products have become increasingly inferior, and exports have decreased. A certain company in New York sent a letter to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Director, we are very grateful for your bureau's 1933 export statistics. This book is very helpful to this industry. After receiving this book, we also learned that your office has established a tea experiment farm. We wish your farm can produce excellent Chinese tea this season. Out of our love for your bureau, we would like to offer a humble opinion, which may be of help to the improvement of Chinese tea. The quantity of Chinese tea imported into the United States is still declining. Last year, the quality of Huzhou and Pingshui green tea was significantly worse than the previous year, which made our customers very unhappy. They told us that if the quality of Pingshui tea is still poor this year, they will not buy Pingshui tea and will only buy a small amount of Huzhou tea. The situation is serious, and we can only hope that your office can produce good tea for sale. We look forward to it very much."</p>

<p>The Longhua District automatic telephone conversion project of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has been completed and will officially open for calls on the 19th. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e152">Project Completed, Trial Calls <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Telephone Bureau has seen a flourishing situation in the Longhua area and a daily increase in the number of telephone subscribers. The original common battery telephone exchange was also obsolete. Therefore, in March of this year, the Ministry of Communications purchased an automatic telephone exchange with 250 lines from the American Automatic Telephone Company. Since dismantling and installation, it was completed last week. The previous two days, Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer of the Telephone Bureau, personally went there to conduct trial calls with the North and South cities, and the results were quite good. Today and tomorrow, trial calls will continue with the Shanghai West Zhenru Jiangwan Wusong areas. It is reported that this telephone exchange is sufficient for three years of need.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Calls on the 19th <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>All eighty-odd telephone sets have been converted last week. The old telephones that were removed will be used in the Minhang District in the future. The Telephone Bureau believes that automatic telephone exchanges and other equipment are more numerous than common battery equipment. The original building was difficult to manage. A new building was specially expanded on the left side of the original bureau to house the automatic telephone equipment and officially open the line at 11:00 PM on the 19th (Saturday). The first number was uniformly changed to "68," and the last three digits were also reorganized in the same way as other districts.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Submarine Cable Not Recovered <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>It has been rumored that the Telephone Bureau intends to switch to direct calls on the 19th for the convenience of city communications and telephones to the concessions, with a direct reporting machine and a counting machine monitoring platform. In the future, you can dial "0" and then dial the concession number to connect (because the original number was called out). However, the relevant parties absolutely denied this. As for the Pujiang submarine cable, after being repeatedly broken, the Telephone Bureau has not yet recovered it. At the same time, in order to repair it as soon as possible to facilitate telephone communication, it is specially supervising the workers to speed up repairs. If the weather is clear tomorrow, it can be repaired the day after tomorrow. Telephone communication between the concession and Pudong is still smooth, and only a major obstacle has occurred between the North and South cities and Pudong.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Tobacco Leaf Association Submits to the Taxation Department: Suggesting Improving Domestic Tobacco Leaves and Requesting Appropriation to Establish Curing Factories <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Ding Zhenbo, standing committee member of the Shanghai Chinese Tobacco Leaf Trade Association, submitted a request to the Taxation Department yesterday, suggesting improving domestic tobacco leaves and requesting that a portion of the government's appropriation to the Tobacco Factory Association be allocated for the organization of curing factories. The original letter was obtained and recorded below. Presented as a proposal for organizing tobacco, requesting examination and approval. I, in private, have investigated that our country is vast and abundant, with rich agricultural products. The needs of the people are fully self-sufficient. Since the opening of the sea ban, foreign goods have been increasing daily, using sophisticated techniques and abundant capital for dumping. Looking back at the products of our country, they stick to the old ways and do not know how to improve, so that foreign goods sell well and domestic goods have almost no foothold. The annual outflow is increasing more and more, which makes me anxious and painful to speak of. I have investigated that the tobacco leaves produced in our country were initially used exclusively for tobacco pipe shops to make dry tobacco. Since the opening of the sea, the better ones have been packaged and sold abroad, such as to Egypt and Germany, and the second-best to Japan and the three northeastern provinces. Since the Republic of China, American tobacco seeds have been distributed in Fengyang County, Anhui Province. Although the tobacco color and texture are good, the smell is not as good as American products. Later, they were planted in prefectures and counties in Shandong Province, but the smell was also not as good as American tobacco. Finally, they were planted in Xiang County, Henan Province, and other places, and the color, texture, and taste were all qualified. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and the Taxation Department was established, our country's tobacco leaves have been divided into two types: local tobacco and miscellaneous tobacco. The difference is that local tobacco is dried in the sun, and the smoke is baked using local methods. There are several reasons why local tobacco cannot be developed in recent years: (1) Local tobacco is divided into red tobacco and white tobacco. Red tobacco is from Guangfeng, Tongxiang, etc., and most of it is sold to Egypt, the Netherlands, and other countries. White tobacco is from Huanggang, Xinchang, Fengzhou, etc., and most of it is sold to Germany, the Netherlands, etc. The second-best is exclusively sold to various inland tobacco pipe shops for the manufacture of dry tobacco, such as Champion, Susong, etc., and sold to Japan, the three northeastern provinces, and various inland tobacco pipe shops. Now, because cigarette production is increasing year by year, local tobacco, because it is dried in the sun, does not have the right smell for cigarette raw materials, so sales are gradually declining. (2) Foreign countries are determined to exclude foreigners, and the import tax on local tobacco is gradually increasing, which has dealt a major blow to domestic tobacco leaves, so the quantity has been very small in recent years. (3) In the Northeast, the puppet Manchukuo is independent, and the import tariff has increased to twelve yuan and five jiao per picul. Moreover, Japan, Korea, and other places also have newly produced American tobacco leaves. Not only are they for their own use, but they are also allowed to supply the puppet Manchukuo, and Shanghai also imports and dumps them. The problem with our production method is that it is not as good as theirs. For example, if the cultivation is proper and scientific methods are used for baking, domestic tobacco leaves will of course not be comparable to them. If the country is to plan for the present, it should immediately catch up, improve domestic tobacco leaves, and start with American flue-cured tobacco. It is estimated that about 100,000 barrels of American tobacco are imported each year, each barrel weighing about 1,000 pounds, totaling 100 million pounds. The average price is about 5 jiao per pound, totaling more than 50 million yuan. Large factories in Britain, the United States, etc. directly purchase from the United States, which is not included in the count. Now, those who manufacture cigarettes use about 70% American tobacco, and only 30% of our country's flue-cured tobacco. There are several reasons why we cannot use more of our country's flue-cured tobacco: (1) For example, Henan flue-cured tobacco has the best quality and taste for cigarette raw materials, but the tobacco seeds have not been changed for many years, and no one guides the cultivation. Although agricultural products depend on the abundance or scarcity of the weather, it is also necessary to study and quickly improve them. (1) Baking is done using local methods, the heat cannot be consistent, and it often spoils quickly, and the color and aroma gradually disappear. Not only is it difficult to sell at a good price, but there is also no way to turn around in terms of finance. (3) The packaging by merchants is inconsistent from top to bottom. For example, tobacco factories need first-class, but there are still second-class mixed in, deceiving themselves and others. This is the main reason for the failure of the old Chinese business. Now, at a time when businesses from various countries are competing, it is difficult to rectify without unity, and rectification cannot be effective without the cooperation of the government and the people. Flue-cured tobacco, after organization and improvement, its future development is of course promising. For example, if cigarette companies use more flue-cured tobacco, our country's outflow can be reduced by tens of millions of yuan. Not only will the rural economy rely on turning around, but government tax revenue can also be increased a lot. The national treasury and people's livelihood will benefit from both. Therefore, improvement and organization are urgent tasks at present. The proposed methods are listed in several points below: (1) Distributing seeds: First, purchase American tobacco seeds and distribute them to farmers so that production can be abundant. (2) Establishing curing factories: This is the fundamental foundation for flue-cured tobacco and taxation. All flue-cured tobacco must be baked nearby to prevent spoilage over time. Tobacco that has been baked can be stored for as long as six years, and the color and aroma can be preserved. Henan flue-cured tobacco, if baked with machines, is no less than imported American tobacco. (3) The organization of curing factories, or officials and merchants each recognize their two official shares, and the annual interest and surplus profits obtained are used for cultivating and guiding farmers and raising seeds, so that the fundamental of flue-cured tobacco is permanently guaranteed. Merchant shares, in addition to extracting a certain amount for public accumulation, are distributed according to shares. (4) The capital of the curing factory must not be used for flue-cured tobacco transactions, so as to avoid cutting off flue-cured tobacco sales. As for the packaging layer, the curing factory should select impartially to avoid the disadvantages of inconsistent tops and bottoms of each package. The grades are selected separately by the vendors, so that all manufacturers and purchasers have standards to follow. (5) If the curing factory is established, the tax revenue can be collected without any leaks, and the tobacco industry can also compete with foreign goods. (6) The construction cost of the curing factory is about 300,000 yuan. The business regulations and construction plan will be presented in detail later. It was previously heard that the Ministry of Finance allocated 300,000 yuan for the promotion and development of cigarettes. I believe that flue-cured tobacco leaves are one of the fundamental raw materials for cigarettes, and I intend to propose several tens of thousands of yuan as the basic fund for curing factories. I would like to ask you to decide and send someone to supervise, so that the plans of merchants and others to improve flue-cured tobacco can be realized with the help of the government. The national economy and people's livelihood will depend on it. Whether the above is appropriate or not, please approve it and follow it. Respectfully presented to Wu, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance. Presented by Ding Zhenbo, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Tobacco Trade Association.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Telegram: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee yesterday, saying (brief): According to a cold telegram from the Shantou North-South Port Association and the Grain Association, Guangdong Province decided to levy a fee of 8 jiao per 100 hits on soybean cakes from the four northeastern provinces entering Guangdong, starting from the 10th of this month. The products from other provinces will still be exempted according to the original plan of April last year. However, the donation merchant Huifeng Company abruptly detained as many as 20 ships and goods, including ships and goods of Shanghai and Hankou cakes that had been sold and transported on the river surface. When asked about the order, it was said that the levy would start on the 10th, so why detain the stored goods? The order was to levy on soybean cakes from the eastern provinces, so why involve those produced in Shanghai and Hankou? They replied that it was difficult to distinguish. They thought that Shanghai and Hankou cakes were shipped from the eastern provinces. The donation merchant takes money as the main thing, turning black into white, and is unreasonable. Please provide assistance, etc. It is found that the current Guangdong Province's levy on donations of soybean cakes in the eastern provinces is scheduled to start on the 10th, which refers to those imported from May 10th. All new taxes are handled in this way. If the old stored goods are included, why set another deadline for the start of the levy? The contractor only knows to collect as much as possible, regardless of the law, and is ignorant of the overall situation. The first point that should be corrected is that it is said that Shanghai and Hankou cakes are probably shipped from the eastern provinces, which shows that the contractor does not know the business situation in various places and makes arbitrary decisions. It is even more regrettable to find that there are a total of 10 factories in Jiangsu Province that manufacture soybean cakes and peanut cakes in Shanghai, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Kunshan. There are five factories in Hankou. The origin of the raw materials is the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The bean production in these five provinces is abundant, and the price is especially cheap. Since September 18, the import of soybean cakes from the three northeastern provinces has been subject to heavy taxes. Therefore, each factory, for the sake of cost, has absolutely no use for bean materials from the eastern provinces. The trademark of each factory's cake is being collected by the Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association and submitted to the government offices in Guangdong Province for record. Even the goods that have been detained by the contractor have factory names and imprints that can be used as evidence and are easy to distinguish. The second point that should be corrected is that, regarding the above two requests, I implore you to quickly take charge of handling them, which is convenient for the public. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows,</p>
<p>Grain Industry Telegram: Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, previously stated that the Shantou donation merchant mistakenly recognized the soybean cakes and peanut cakes shipped to the area as products from the eastern provinces and detained them for heavy taxation. In addition to having telegraphed the authorities in Guangzhou and Shantou on the 13th to correct this, he also telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting that they be ordered to release them. The content is as follows (brief): It is found that the Zhongxing steamship loaded 18,200 pieces of soybean cake and peanut cake from this factory and transported them to Guangzhou. They were mistakenly recognized by the local donation merchant Huifeng Company as goods from the eastern provinces and charged heavy taxes. At the same time, it was also reported by the guild members that the cakes shipped to Shantou on various ships are said by donation merchants to be produced in the eastern provinces and must be treated as imported fertilizer and charged heavy taxes, etc. Please immediately telegraph to prove the release. It is found that the tax collection in Guangdong Province is handled by the donation merchant Huanfeng Company. Recently, Huanfeng Company announced that it had received an order from the Commissioner of Finance of Guangdong Province to treat the soybean cake transported from the three northeastern provinces as imported fertilizer for farmland and collect a surcharge of 8 hao per 100 jin. If they are soil-made cakes not produced in the three northeastern provinces, they are not subject to taxation. Then the tax boundary is clear like stars, why is it that the ink is not dry, and suddenly the soil-made cakes at the entrance are either said to be imported from the eastern provinces, or the raw materials are produced in the eastern provinces. They even think that the trademark can be ordered directly from the factories in the eastern provinces. There are many far-fetched things, the intention is to attach to the ranks of foreign goods, and must be taxed heavily. Such strange things, Liang Yong surprised. Since September 18, the government has vigorously implemented the blockade policy, and all goods imported from the eastern provinces have been taxed as foreign goods, so imports have suddenly become rare, and domestic factories have been established to meet the needs, and they have followed one after another. If Shanghai has more than enough, Changde, Dade, Xinshui, Fengchangji, Wuxi Hengde, Runfeng, Changzhou Xiefeng, Kunshan Housheng, and Hankou factories, there are 15 factories with equipment, all self-made, sold domestically, and Guangzhou and Shantou are the most prosperous. The manufacturing raw materials are all collected from the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu. In recent years, the bean production in these five provinces has been abundant and surplus everywhere, and the price is extremely low, so all factories take it from this. If it is as Huanfeng Company pointed out, then the import will be subject to heavy taxes, and more freight will be required, and the cost will be more expensive. I would like to ask why manufacturers bother to set up factories by themselves and put themselves in a loss? All of this is a very obvious fact. If you consider it carefully, how can you not understand? It is only because the donation merchant is responsible for the tax collection, only counting the prosperity of the tax revenue and the thickness of his own profits, and he does not care about turning black into white, and he is bound to collect the tax. Once this end is opened, the inland oil cake industry, which is still in its infancy, will be at a loss, where can we expect its development? What's more, cake is the only fertilizer for farmland. Directly taxing the factory heavily is indirectly increasing the burden on farmers. Now the rural areas are bankrupt and industry and commerce are in trouble. Above and below, we are working hard to realize the revival of the countryside and increase production. The central government implemented the blockade policy in the eastern provinces the year before last, and recently Guangdong Province added heavy taxes on imported fertilizer, all of which are good policies to protect domestic production. Guangzhou and Shantou donation merchants do not see this, only the tax is collected, and they want to eliminate the domestic production opportunities and speak for the imported fertilizer. How can the above meet the central government's intentions and how can the below comfort the people's hope? The guild feels it and is deeply frightened. In addition to having telegraphed the authorities in Guangzhou and Shantou on New Year's Day to correct it, it is reasonable to state the facts directly. I implore you to consult the Guangdong Provincial Government, and order the Commissioner of Finance to strictly order Huanfeng Company, the donation merchant in Guangzhou and Shantou, to quickly release the domestic cakes of this factory that have been detained this time, and not to arbitrarily cause trouble in the future, so as to maintain domestic products and comply with government orders.</p>

Regarding the candidates to be filled, according to reliable news, the Central Standing Committee has passed yesterday Zhao Banfu and Sun Lyping to be the preparatory committee members of the association, filling the vacancies of Lin and Zhang. It is also known that the two new members of Zhao Sun received an order from the Central People's Movement Association yesterday afternoon, instructing them to take office as soon as possible and work hard. According to Zhao Jun in the past, he served as a member of the Seafarers' Reorganization Committee and has been committed to shipping for a long time. The reputation and hope are strong. Sun Jun was originally the secretary of the association. He has handled negotiations many times, so that all the accumulated cases can be satisfactorily resolved, and his work is very great, and he is deeply entrusted by the seafarers. Therefore, the Central Committee specially selected the two gentlemen to supplement, I think the sea association will have further performance in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers held a regular meeting at the Bankers' Association Club at 7 PM on the 16th of this month. More than 20 people attended the meeting. After Chairman Xu Peihuang reported on the association's affairs, Mr. Guo Boling, a member, was invited to give a speech on the topic of "The Use of Oxygen and Its Manufacture." After Guo Jun studied in the United Kingdom and returned to China, he served as a key position in the railway, coal, iron mine, and arsenal aspects. First, he described the wide range of uses of oxygen in industry, medicine, and military affairs. Secondly, he described the various manufacturing methods of liquid oxygen in European and American countries and the advantages and disadvantages of various methods. In view of the lack of domestic factories manufacturing oxygen, it is necessary to rely on foreign merchants for supply, and the price is high. Therefore, he raised funds to establish China Refining Gas Company to manufacture oxygen, and began production last year. The quality is pure and has been certified by British and German experts. Many purchasers. Two foreign manufacturers in this city, therefore, lowered prices and dumped them. Before the company was established, the price of liquid oxygen per cubic foot was more than two yuan. After the company's products were produced, the price dropped to about eight jiao. However, Guo Jun explained that the company expected this kind of thing to happen, has strong capital, and decided to fight unremittingly. After the speech, each member asked and discussed the manufacturing technology in detail. The meeting adjourned at 10 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Taxpayers' Association Sends Three Letters to the Public Works Department to Correct the Cases of Water Cut-Offs, Fire Cut-Offs, and Shanty Towns <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent separate letters to Mr. Zhong Si, Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, yesterday regarding the re-cutting of water in Peide Lane on Xinza Road, the deadline for demolishing shanty towns on Qiqihar Road, and the fact that Cai Songmao's cigarette paper shop had paid the electricity bill but had the fire meter cut off, requesting that they be investigated and handled separately. The three letters are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e161">Order to Turn on Water Immediately <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: According to a letter from Wang Xianyu, the lawyer stated, "According to the letter from all the tenants of Peide Lane on Xinza Road, the water supply of the tenants was cut off by the water company at the instigation of the landlord Tianzhu Church on the 24th of last month. The tenants argued in accordance with the provisions of the patent contract of March 17, 1928, and May 3, 1933, that the water company shall not listen to the landlord's request and cut off the water supply to houses where the landlord pays the water bill and the house is inhabited. The company knew that it was wrong and automatically turned on the water at 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month. Fortunately, the company regretted its past mistakes and did not repeat the tragedy. Later, on the 8th of this month, the company sent a letter saying that it was necessary to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan for using the main water meter and sign a contract, etc. At 10:30 AM on the 10th, they followed the instructions to carry cash to the company to negotiate, and declared that this payment was purely to pay on behalf of the landlord to avoid the company's loss due to the landlord's failure to pay the fee, and that they would seek compensation from the landlord in the future. However, the company replied that this contract was paid by the tenants themselves and had nothing to do with the landlord. The tenants previously refused to install separate water meters because the landlord did not deduct the water bill in the rent. This time, the contract was signed, which was no different from admitting that there was no water bill in the landlord's rent, and it was paid by the tenants themselves. Please note on the side of the contract that the words "pay on behalf of the landlord" were also rejected. It is obvious that they are biased towards the landlord. They immediately declared that if the money was not willing to be accepted, it would be deposited in the Public Works Department and other words and withdrew. Without waiting a moment, the company sent someone in a car to close the water meter and implement the second water cut-off, repeating its inhuman approach, in order to achieve its private conspiracy to force submission. Such behavior is simply taking water cut-offs as a child's play and human life as a trifle. We specially entrust you to send a letter to the association and ask you to quickly send a letter to the Public Works Department to inform the company to restore the water immediately and stop this inhumane behavior from happening repeatedly, etc. It is found that the installation of separate water meters and the water bill are directly paid by the users. The Shanghai Real Estate Association had a notice stating that the landlord should deduct the water bill of seven and a half cents included in the rent to the tenants. Now, the landlord of Peide Lane has not deducted the water bill of seven and a half cents included in the rent to the tenants, which means that the bill for not paying the water bill has not been fulfilled in the first place, then it is still the same as the situation of bearing the payment of the water bill. According to the patent contract, the water company should not cut off the water. Now, the tenants of this lane, in order to avoid trouble for the water company, pay the deposit and bear the water bill. It is only necessary for the water company to note on the receipt, even on the water contract, that it is paid on behalf of the landlord, which is benevolence and righteousness, and it is a civil act that should be. The water company forgets its legal responsibility to obtain the franchise and rejects it and cuts off the water immediately. The statement that it is biased towards the landlord is difficult to accept. It should be requested that your office order the water company to turn on the water immediately to save the people and maintain the contract."</p>
<h3 id="e162">Do Not Demolish the Straw Sheds <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Bureau,</p>
<p>We have recently learned that your Bureau, citing hygiene as the reason, intends to demolish around fifty straw sheds located along Qihar Road and Yanshan Road before May 21st. Our Association, in principle, has no objection to the demolition of straw sheds to improve the city's appearance and benefit public hygiene. However, on one hand, the general social and economic conditions must be taken into account, and on the other hand, the living conditions of the impoverished classes must be considered. If the reason for demolition is hygiene, improvements to sanitation facilities should simply be ordered. If demolition is ordered simply because something is considered unhygienic, then even tall buildings and magnificent mansions may also have unhygienic aspects. Would you then order their demolition? Our Association's opinion is that existing structures should be maintained and improved in terms of sanitation facilities, and that no new ones should be allowed to appear. This matter concerns the survival of the impoverished classes and the stability of society. We respectfully request your Bureau to consider this matter at length, and we would be most grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Investigate the Power Cut <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Bureau,</p>
<p>According to a letter from Cai Hequan on May 7th, he states that his merchant has been running a Cai Songmao cigarette and paper shop in Yongcheng Lane, Huaji Road, for several years, with a deposit of fifty taels of silver for the electric lights. Last Wednesday, he received a letter from the power company stating that the electricity bill was 28 yuan and 18 cents. He paid them yesterday, but since it was Sunday, he paid it this morning at 7:30 am. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 am, the company suddenly came to cut the meter, handed him a receipt on the spot, ignored it, and cut the line without permission, fleeing like a fugitive. He immediately sent his apprentice to report to the power company, but the employee said that it would cost three yuan to reconnect the line. We dare to ask your Association to quickly investigate this matter to avoid such harsh treatment and to have compassion for merchants. Our Association believes that even if electricity bills are overdue and unpaid, the electricity can be cut off. However, if the person cutting off the power sees a receipt showing that the electricity bill has been paid, they should not cut off the power. If they do cut off the power, the fault lies with the person who cut it off. This matter concerns public utilities, and we respectfully request your Bureau to investigate.</p>

<p>Xie Jiafu, a native of Ningbo, is 22 years old and lives at No. 7, Sunjili, Rue de la Cathédrale, in the French Concession. He runs a yellow sand and gravel business. He married a woman from the same village, Le Mingzhufeng, who is the same age as Xie. The couple loved each other very much. However, Xie was young and handsome, dressed in Western suits and leather shoes, and looked like a rich young man. He was fond of romance and often frequented歌台舞榭, song and dance venues. Recently, he met a dancing girl named Xue Fengzhu. In order to gain the trust of Miss Xue and to increase their love, Xie had a whimsical idea. On the afternoon of the 24th of last month, at 2:00 pm, he went to the Fuxu Road Branch of the China Industrial Bank at No. 517 and paid one yuan to open a savings account. He used Xue Fengzhu's name to deposit the money, and the bank issued him a savings book with number 394, which Xie took home. Unexpectedly, Xie then</p>
<h3 id="e171">Indulged in Wishful Thinking <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The next day, he added the words "nine hundred and ninety-nine yuan" himself in the book, affixed a fake seal, and made it up to a thousand yuan. After completing this procedure, he placed the book in his suitcase, waiting for the opportunity to show it to Miss Xue, in order to boast of his wealth and that he had deposited a thousand yuan for her, as a false pretense to increase their love. However, Xie's wife, Le, because she had long known that her husband was seeking pleasure outside and had met a dancing girl, could not help but be jealous, so she often took the opportunity to search Xie's pockets and had obtained letters and photos of Miss Xue, advising her husband to no avail. On the evening of the 10th of this month, when her husband went out, she searched her husband's suitcase under the bed and found this bank savings book.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Secretly Pleased <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>She thought that her husband still had some private money left and had deposited it in the bank. However, because she was illiterate and did not know the amount of money in the book, she gave the book to her brother, Le Jiafu (28 years old, who runs a construction factory), who lived with her. After reading it, he learned that the book belonged to her husband's mistress, the dancing girl Xue Fengzhu. This made her even more jealous. The next day, she asked her brother Le Jiafu to take the book to the China Industrial Bank branch to inquire. Le took the book to the bank to check, and wanted to withdraw three hundred yuan. After the teller checked the account book, he found that there was only one yuan in Xue Fengzhu's account. Where did the added nine hundred and ninety-nine yuan come from?</p>

<p>The money was obviously a fraudulent alteration of the savings book. He immediately reported to the bank manager Zhu Xuefan and reported to the French police. Detective Superintendent Jin Jiulin, along with detective Yang Yilong, immediately rushed to arrest Le. After interrogation, they also arrested Xie Jiafu and Xie Le. After questioning, the report was made to the head of the police, who ordered them to be detained and sent to the Second Special District Court for further investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special Court interrogated them in the Criminal Court. Yao Zhaodi, the police lawyer, stated the police investigation process and presented the altered savings book as evidence. He filed a lawsuit against the three defendants for forgery of seals under Articles 224, 234, and 363 of the Criminal Law.</p>

<p>The plaintiff, Zhu Xuefan, was represented by the bank employee Zhang Binghai, who stated that the defendant Le Jiafu brought the book to the bank, checked the deposit, and requested to withdraw three hundred yuan. When questioned, Le Jiafu confessed that his sister had entrusted him to take the book to the China Industrial Bank branch to inquire about the deposit, and he did not dare to request a withdrawal or commit fraud. Xie Jiafu confessed that he went to the Industrial Bank branch to open a savings account and filled out the savings book himself. He did it to please the dancing girl and make his wife angry, and had no other intentions. Le confessed that she obtained the book from her husband's suitcase, knew it was the dancing girl's deposit, and asked her brother to take it to inquire, but she did not tell her brother to withdraw the deposit. Then, the police clerk and the defendant's lawyer argued with each other. The court ordered the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict.</p>

<p>At around 9:00 pm on December 22nd of last year, the home of Jiang Baolin, a Ningbo native, at No. 26 Huishan Road, was broken into by thieves. Just as they were about to search and rob, Lin's wife cleverly locked the upstairs door, opened the window, and shouted for help. The robbers fled in panic without any losses. Jiang immediately reported to the Huishan Police Station. Later, the robbers Chen Anjiu and Lu Qilong, and the suspect Xiang Meifu, were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, it was found that Lu and Chen had committed other robberies with accomplices and were sentenced to imprisonment. However, Xiang knew that the case was committed by Dai Abao, Zhou Bosun, and Little Elephant Mountain, and that he had not gone. As a result, Xiang was declared innocent. The day before yesterday, Su Changsheng, a Chinese detective of the Yulin Road Police Station, learned that Dai Abao, a Ningbo native, 35 years old, was hiding in a house at No. 1 Kelneng Hai Road. He and a Western detective secretly went to the address and arrested him, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, the case was handed over to the Third Criminal Court. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the Municipal Council, stated the previous situation and said that the defendant admitted at the police station that he went with the escaped Zhou Bosun, Little Elephant Mountain, and others. He also accompanied the detectives to the scene to demonstrate. When questioned, Dai Abao said that Zhou Bosun had learned that the owner's house had a large amount of opium, and that his friend Little Elephant Mountain had invited him to rob the opium. Yu supplied support, and the owner, Jiang Baolin, and his wife did not appear in court. Judge Liu Yugui ordered him to be remanded to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>The Xu family at No. 6, Lane 167, Beihai Road, was sued for rent arrears and the First Special Court approved a provisional attachment. On the 14th of this month, the request was granted. At around 2:00 pm, the court sent judicial police to seal the house. Unexpectedly, Wang Fugen, 34 years old, was lying on a couch in the house, smoking opium. Suddenly, he heard the police knocking on the door urgently, thinking they were coming to arrest him. He immediately ran to the drying platform, intending to escape to the neighbor's house to hide. Unexpectedly, he was careless and fell to the ground, suffering serious head injuries. After the police reported to the Old Gate Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate, he was taken to the hospital for treatment to no avail. He died the day before yesterday. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday, the Procuratorate of the First Special Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to go to the morgue to examine the body. After inquiring about the situation from the judicial police chief who went to seal the door that day, Mr. Guo concluded that the deceased Wang Fugen died from head injuries sustained in a fall. The body was handed over to his wife, Wang Chen, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to all public and private primary and secondary schools, broadcasting stations, amusement parks, cinemas, and record companies, stating that obscene songs are detrimental to public morals and have long been strictly prohibited by the Bureau. It has now been found that songs such as "Peach Blossom River" and "The Song of the Dance Partner" have obscene lyrics and performances, and are spreading rapidly in the city, harming young people. It is extremely regrettable and should be strictly prohibited from being sung. In addition to issuing orders and sending personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time, you are urgently ordered to comply. In the future, you must not sing, broadcast, or record these songs. All existing records must be submitted to the Bureau for destruction. Do not deliberately violate this order. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Shanghai South: Public Bus Routes - Steps Defined by the Municipal Public Works Bureau <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau, recognizing that public transportation in Shanghai South has been greatly inconvenienced since the former Shanghai South Automobile Company, which was run by merchants, failed due to poor management and ceased operations, presented a request to the municipal government last October to have the Bureau continue to operate the public bus service in order to develop transportation in Shanghai South. After several months of preparation, the Bureau purchased vehicles and established a Public Bus Management Office, which began operations on April 1 of this year. However, the Bureau was very cautious about how to define the routes for the public buses. After careful consideration and weighing the urgency, it was decided to first operate routes two and three of the former Shanghai South Public Bus Company. The previous route two, from Old West Gate to Longhua Line, was renamed route one to accommodate citizens traveling to Longhua for sightseeing and to meet the needs of residents in that area. Route three, the circular route around the city, remains route three. Although this line is already served by trams, there are many passengers, and the Chinese Tram Company has entered into a contract with the French Tram Company to operate only eight trams each, and neither company is allowed to freely increase the number of trams. This has resulted in extremely crowded passengers, which is not appropriate. In order to meet the needs of citizens, it is necessary to add trams to this route for adjustment. Moreover, the transportation business has a close relationship with the municipal government. The more transportation tools there are, the faster the city will prosper. It is not only possible to alleviate the crowding of passengers. However, the Bureau's current two public bus routes are only the beginning of the city-run public buses. Other routes in the Shanghai South area are also being tested and prepared for expansion at any time, so that the transportation network of the city can be connected and contribute to the construction of Greater Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Municipal Council Discusses Music Team Improvement Plan <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Music Committee held its first meeting the other day. Mr. Harris was elected chairman by the members. Then the General Office reported on the proposal to hold summer outdoor concerts at the Racecourse. Because the location is suitable, the audience may be enthusiastic, and there are convenient doors for easy access. The music team leader said that this was done from 1930 to 1932, but it stopped because there were not many listeners. After discussion, the public agreed that the facilities at the Racecourse could attract more listeners, especially Chinese people, and agreed to hold a weekly concert there instead of Zhaofeng Park. The committee also asked the team leader to consider and report on changing the 9:15 pm summer concerts to the afternoon, performing in the park on Saturdays and Sundays, and adding children's concerts or school concerts. As for the summer concerts in Zhaofeng Park, the team leader suggested adding broadcasting equipment to broadcast to other parks, which was approved. The team leader will investigate and report on the cost of the equipment. Messrs. Brickle and Hawthorne submitted a letter proposing ways to save expenses. After consideration, the members considered that the proposal involved organizational changes and was mostly related to winter performances, and decided to discuss it when the winter plan was discussed. At the same time, the proposal was sent to the various administrative departments and committee members for comments for reference. Also, regarding the program list for each performance, in order to maintain a popular and accessible style, the team leader should send it to the committee for review every week before it is announced. In addition, the Municipal Council's music team can be invited for full or partial performances with private funding, but the public may not know about this. The fee schedule for this service is currently being reviewed by the members to see if there are any changes that should be made. After it is determined, it should be announced as much as possible so that the public is aware.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Tao Jia Yao Sues Gao Xiaochen for Assault - Gao Denies Assaulting Tao - Court Orders Forensic Examination <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Previously, Gao Xiaochen had filed a private prosecution against Tao Jia Yao in the Second Special District Court for fraud. During the court hearing on the third of this month, both parties were ordered to go outside and reconcile. After leaving the courtroom, Tao Jia Yao was suddenly attacked and vomited blood near the stairwell. This matter has already been reported in the previous newspaper. Now, Tao has retained Luo Jiaheng, Wang Zaoshi, and Li Guozhen, three lawyers, to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Gao Xiaochen of assault. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Fanglian summoned Gao to the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, due to serious injuries, was unable to appear in court and was represented by his lawyers who stated the grounds for the prosecution. They stated that after the court adjourned on the third of this month, when Tao Jia Yao was walking to the stairs, the defendant Gao Xiaochen suddenly shouted loudly at Tao, "I must beat you to death!" After saying this, he punched Tao hard from behind. Fortunately, two bailiffs saw it and stopped him, and helped Tao into the lawyers' lounge. At that time, Tao vomited two mouthfuls of blood due to the injury. Judge Xiong witnessed this and ordered the clerk to take notes. He also reopened the court, summoned Gao to the court, and reprimanded him for the assault, immediately ordering him to post bail (which his representative lawyer did). He also instructed Tao Jia Yao to go to the forensic office for an injury examination and file another lawsuit. Because it was late and past office hours, the forensic doctor had already gone home. Therefore, Tao went home and immediately asked Dr. Song Yuqi of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to come to his home for treatment. Now there is a medical certificate to prove this. Unexpectedly, Tao cannot sleep at night and cannot eat, and his condition has suddenly worsened. Yesterday, he vomited blood again (now the phlegm sample can be brought to court as evidence). It is found that the defendant Gao Xiaochen is a former military officer and skilled in boxing. Considering the nature of the assault, it is requested that the severity of future injuries be reserved, and that the defendant be punished according to Article 295, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, for the corresponding crime, etc. In response to the interrogation, the defendant Gao Xiaochen stated, "Tao Jia Yao and I were originally friends. A lawsuit arose due to debt matters. Because he said unpleasant things about me in court, after the court adjourned, I was walking outside and called Tao to stop to reason with him. Because he didn't hear me, I stepped forward and grabbed his clothes, but I did not hit him. Tao Jia Yao has a long-standing illness. When he was in the sanatorium, I went to the hospital to visit him," etc. Lawyers Xiang Xun and Liu Cailiang defended him. Bailiff Xu Huizhang, No. 529, testified, "On the third of this month, I was on duty upstairs. When the court adjourned, Tao Jia Yao was walking in front, and I was behind Tao, and Gao Xiaochen was behind me. At that time, Gao angrily said to Tao, 'You shouldn't have said I was poor in court!' At the same time, he stepped forward and grabbed Tao's right arm. I was afraid that something would happen, so I immediately shouted to stop him and sent Tao into the lawyers' lounge." The judge asked if he saw Tao vomit blood, and he replied, "I saw Tao vomit two mouthfuls of blood at the time." Witness Cai Ying testified, "I work in the lawyers' lounge. I didn't see the dispute when both sides were arguing, but when Tao arrived at the lawyers' lounge, I saw Tao vomit blood." At this point, lawyer Luo Jiaheng stated that Tao Jia Yao had been to court several times, each time for three or four hours, and had never vomited blood. How could he have a long-standing illness? Judge Wu ordered a forensic doctor to be dispatched to Tao's home along with both parties' lawyers to examine the plaintiff's injuries for verification.</p>

The request could not be processed and the situation has been explained to the members. (B) The union requested that all employees, regardless of rank, be issued badges. According to the Postmaster's reply, the General Post Office instructed that in addition to postal assistants and above being issued badges, messengers and laborers would be issued chest badges or armbands when necessary. The union maintains its original request for everyone to be issued badges. After negotiation with the bureau, they agreed to investigate with other agencies before proceeding. (3) Standing Committee member Zhang Kechang reported that he went to Beijing on the 13th of this month to attend the General Assembly Standing Committee meeting.

(B) Regarding the issue of combined postal and telecommunications services, the committee members specifically explained to Vice Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Communications the impact of the combination on postal economics and administration. Vice Minister Zhang stated that the combination is completely different from a merger. The combination of postal and telecommunications services is based on the principle of saving expenses and facilitating the public. It will not disrupt the economics and administration of both parties. He hoped postal workers would not worry too much. During the trial period, if facts occur that violate the above two principles, the Ministry will give full consideration to the opinions of subordinates and seek special solutions. (C) Resuming the personnel qualification examination system - Vice Minister Zhang sincerely expressed his support for this matter and intended to instruct the General Office to work with the General Assembly to design and implement it effectively. (D) Recruitment of students to study in Austria - The union and the General Assembly have repeatedly suggested methods. Vice Minister Zhang did not express a definite opinion on this, but hoped postal workers would not misunderstand. (E) Regarding the consolidation of the postal base implementation plan, the situation of reviewing regulations was inquired at the Legislative Yuan, and opinions on this matter were expressed. Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Liang Hancao agreed to accept it and forward it to the Regulations and Economics Committees for prompt action.

<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative, in order to promote economic cooperation, held an economic cooperation movement in February and March. Six special issues on economic cooperation were published in the Shanghai Shen Bao, News Daily, Morning Post, Min Bao, Shih Shih Hsin Pao, and Shang Bao. However, the lack of systematic publicity made it difficult to attract the attention of the public.

<p>A nameless girl, about six years old, wearing a white short shirt and blue cloth trousers, with scars on both temples, lost her way at 2:00 PM on the 15th on Pingji Li Road in the French Concession and cried. Another girl, about four or five years old, wearing a red foreign cloth shirt and black foreign cloth trousers, lost her way at 6:00 PM on the same day in the Baxian Bridge area. The patrolmen found them and took them to the police station one after another. Because the two children spoke unclearly, it was impossible to trace their families. The police chief ordered them to be temporarily kept at the police station, pending family members claiming them. If any family members who have lost children see the report, they can go to the Lujiiawan French General Police Station to claim them.</p>

<p>Orthopedist Tong Zhongyi Repeatedly Cures Bone Fracture and Serious Injuries - Orthopedist Tong Zhongyi is the Shaolin director of the Martial Arts Hall in this city. He is not only skilled in martial arts but also proficient in orthopedics. He has unique skills in treating fractures and dislocations, with a proven record of recovery. He now hangs his shingle at No. 23, Renxiong Lane (i.e., Lane 124) on the south side of Tongfu Road Gan Haiwei Road. Mr. Zhang Cengjie, chairman of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, previously fell from a car and injured his thigh, with a broken leg. Due to his old age and weakened blood, many doctors were helpless. Later, after Tong performed bone-setting surgery, he was able to walk with a cane in ten days and fully recovered in a month. Also, the son of Mr. Fang Xiuren, the owner of the Laoda Fang store in Ximen in this city, was only ten years old. Near Wansheng Bridge, he was knocked down and run over by a private car of a West Inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and his leg bones were all broken. He was sent to a major hospital in Hunan, which was planning to amputate the leg. Then, through a friend's introduction, Tong carefully treated him, applying medicine and health care. He recovered completely in more than a month and is still studying at Xicheng Elementary School, running and jumping freely, without any trace of having suffered severe injuries. For those seeking treatment for broken arms and dislocations, the effect is even more rapid. The doctor is righteous and chivalrous and does not have the habits of current doctors. Even for the poor and sick, the consultation fee is not calculated, and he must do his best to treat them as if they were his own illness. People like Mr. Tong, with his divine skills and benevolent heart, are truly a compassionate rescuer for orthopedics and a saint of bone-setting.</p>

Zhang was so grateful that he scheduled to present a plaque at Dr. Guo's clinic at Tongbao Kang Pharmacy on Taopeng Road, Pingliang Road on May 20th of the Gregorian calendar. Many patients in this city who have been cured by Dr. Guo will go there at the same time to praise his benevolence.

<p>To Whom It May Concern, I recently received a statement from my client Jian Liang Jingfen stating that the news in today's newspapers "Jian Zhaonan's Wife and Daughter Involved in Lawsuit" is mostly inconsistent with the facts. Jingfen is Zhaonan's concubine, and the legal wife, Mrs. Pan, is still alive. This is one point. Zhenyi is Jingfen's adopted daughter, not born by Zhaonan. This is the second point. As for the various sections of Zhenyi’s courtroom statement, are purely fabricated and slanderous with ulterior motives. The truth will be revealed one day. Please ask your lawyer to send a letter to each newspaper to correct the situation. This is to inform you of the situation, and I hope that you will publish this letter, and I will be infinitely grateful. Sincerely, To the editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper, Lawyer He Shimei, May 17, 23rd year of the Republic of China</p>

<h3 id="e206">Review of Several Basic Problems in Philosophy (III) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Having explained the content of "identity" and "unity" for several days, today we will further explain the two questions, "two" and "three," raised by Mr. Sheng. Editor</p>
<p>Two: 'The identity of opposites is relative, the struggle of opposites is absolute'</p>
<p>This is the most important and most fundamental part of the epistemology of dialectics. Within the large group of dialectical materialists, there are many theorists and practitioners who, due to incorrect understanding or insufficient knowledge of this fundamental part, unknowingly find themselves in a situation of struggling with dialectics. For example, Bogdanov, Deborin, Lóvol, and Bukharin. The general theorists of the Second International, led by Kautsky, also regarded the identity of opposites as absolute and as a permanent harmony, obliterating the absoluteness of the struggle of opposites, and thus becoming traitors to the revolution. From this, we can know the importance of this principle.</p>
<p>So, how should we interpret the phrase "the identity of opposites is relative"? Let's still use the examples we used before. Yellow cattle and water buffalo are two opposing objects, they have similarities, they both have horns, they both eat grass, they both ruminate, and they can both plow fields and pull carts, which is called the identity of opposites. But this kind of identity is not absolute, that is to say, yellow cattle are not completely equal to water buffalo. Because their fur color and personality have various differences, so it is relative (conditional). The same is true for all natural objects such as horses and mules. Since the development of natural science, it has increasingly proved the correctness of this principle. For example, when water is exposed to sunlight, it evaporates into gas and becomes clouds. When clouds encounter cold, they turn into rain and revert to water. Also, such as positive and negative numbers, differential and integral calculus in mathematics. Astronomy and geography, physics and chemistry, all have commonalities, but none are absolute. These are examples from natural science.</p>
<p>If we talk about social, political, and economic science, the reader will understand it more clearly. For example, during the French Revolution, the bourgeoisie, the proletariat, and the peasant petty bourgeoisie jointly opposed the autocratic regime of landlords and feudal aristocrats, and demanded democratic republic. This illustrates that the interests of each opposing class are the same in the democratic revolution against landlords and feudal aristocrats, and the identity of these opposing classes – mainly the bourgeoisie and the proletariat! – is only a temporary identity in the (conditional) revolution against feudal autocracy, not a permanent identity, not an absolute identity. The failure of the "Paris Commune," the great bloodshed of workers and peasants, and the "Jacobin" regime are all concrete facts illustrating this principle, that is, the example of the February Revolution in Russia in 1917 mentioned earlier, also illustrates "the struggle of opposites is absolute." As long as we pay a little attention to social phenomena, we can find extremely appropriate examples anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>In short, there is nothing permanent and unchanging. For example, water turns into clouds, wood and bamboo stems turn into paper, chicken eggs hatch into chicks, and seeds germinate, grow branches and leaves, bloom and bear fruit, and then turn into seeds again; anytime, anywhere, one form changes into another form; this changing process turns into its own opposite. The immobility of any process is relative. But the transformation of one process into another process is absolute. Therefore, it is said that "the identity of opposites! Condensation, harmony, and balance! are conditional, temporary, transient, and relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, the same as development and movement is absolute.”</p>
<p>Only by grasping this correct law of cognition can people grasp the key to the self-movement of all existing things; only it can provide the key to understanding change, development, sudden change, gradual interruption, transformation into opposites, the disappearance of the old and the growth of the new. Otherwise, the world will be seen as static, dead, and lifeless. (III) "Human knowledge is an active process that is included as a motive in multi-faceted social practice."</p>
<p>As mentioned before, nature, society, thought, forms, and concepts are separate unity and unified division; all are inseparable from the laws of contradiction, change, development, old decrease, and new birth, so human knowledge is not static and dead, but lively and vivid.</p>
<p>With the invention and development of natural science, human knowledge of natural phenomena has greatly improved. Before Darwin's theory of evolution was invented, it was thought that humans were created by God. Later, human knowledge of humans denied the divine creation of God and affirmed that humans, like other creatures, were transformed from other animals, that is, transformed from apes. Columbus's successful navigation discovered a new world – the Americas – outside the old world. Magellan's successful circumnavigation discovered that the Earth is round and denied the previous understanding that the Earth is square. The invention of astronomy and the successful manufacturing of various astronomical instruments denied the previous recognition of eight planets and established the existence of nine planets. The lunar and solar eclipses that people thought were magical have also become unremarkable due to the development of astronomy. The invention of electrons denied the assumption that atoms were the highest element, and the invention of machines eliminated small-scale industrial workshops. The invention of the fire plow and harvester created new-style large farms.</p>
<p>In the late 18th century and mid-19th century, the development of history and social sciences confirmed the theory of inevitable social change. Primitive communist society transformed into tribal society; tribal society transformed into feudal society; feudal society transformed into capitalist society, and capitalist society will also decline and transform into another kind of society (socialist society). The process of transformation may be fast or slow, or the forms may be different, but the recognition of transformation is certain.</p>
<p>When European capitalist forces invaded China, it shook the rural economies of various provinces in southern China – especially the coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. British machine-woven cloth shattered the large cloth of Nanjing and the native cloth of Guangzhou; it also shattered the textile industry of rural housewives. At first, people only thought that the "red-haired people" were bad, competing with Chinese people for food, and foreign machines were bad, taking away the jobs of the handicraft industry. Therefore, the farmers of Sanyuanjing in Guangzhou (a rural area on the outskirts of Guangzhou, with textiles as the economic life of the entire village, with a population of more than 30,000) went to Guangzhou in groups to protest and smashed foreign commercial houses and their machines. The demolition of the newly built Shanghai-Wusong Railway also had the same anti-foreign and machine-hating significance as the Sanyuanjing farmers' riots. This kind of thing also happened in England when the machine industry gradually developed, with farmers and handicraftsmen destroying machines. Later, the development of facts made people realize that this was not a question of Chinese and foreigners, machines and handicrafts, but the course of capitalist development, and the Opium War, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Boxer Rebellion, until the "May Thirtieth" Movement, the slogan of "Down with Imperialism" was recognized by people.</p>
<p>Because reality is changing and developing, our understanding of reality also changes with it. From the above explanation, it can be clearly seen. However, we should not think that this kind of understanding is like a mirror reflecting a person's face, reflecting it without any difference or conditions. For example, (anti-imperialism). It is not because we already have the fact of anti-imperialism that we reflect the slogan of "anti-imperialism". Rather, it is because the imperialist aggression is intensifying and the national crisis is deepening, that we regard the slogan of "anti-imperialism" as a fighting banner that can liberate the Chinese nation in practice (in the movement). Another example is "resistance to Japan". It is not because there are activities of volunteer soldiers and the Battle of Shanghai that the understanding of resistance to Japan is reflected. Rather, it is after the "September 18th" Incident that Japanese imperialism has been approaching step by step, and it is recognized from practice that resistance to Japan is the task of resolving the most urgent crisis at present. If understanding is regarded as a reflection of change, then the slogans of "anti-imperialism" and "resistance to Japan" are just soulless dead slogans. The May Thirtieth Movement is only the starting point of the Chinese anti-imperialist movement becoming a conscious movement, because it put forward the slogan of anti-imperialism and popularized the anti-imperialist movement in practical movement. This is a very clear example. Readers who want to gain a thorough understanding must find examples from their own practical life. There is also a principle explanation in Chapter 2 of this book. Readers can gain a considerable understanding by reading it a few more times. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Far Eastern Games, yesterday was originally the fifth day of the Games, but unexpectedly, there was heavy rain in Manila yesterday morning, and it did not stop until noon. All competitions could not be carried out. The Organizing Committee officially announced that all of yesterday's competitions would be postponed by one day, but the China-Japan baseball game will still be held today, and the China-Philippines basketball game will also be rescheduled for tonight. The full Executive Committee rescheduled to hold meetings on the 19th and 20th. Three proposals from China have been submitted to the Philippine Sports Association. Japan's attitude is unpredictable, and the proposal has not been announced. It is undoubtedly to revise the constitution. The Dutch East Indies is scheduled to return home on the 19th and will be absent at that time, so Japan is quite worried about the adjournment of the conference. Of all the ball sports championships, volleyball has returned to the Philippines. China is confident only in football. It is regrettable that protests have been incessant at this conference. As for today's main events, in addition to track and field and swimming, ball sports include China-Philippines basketball, volleyball, China-Japan baseball, and the Philippines-Japan tennis final.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Tonight at 8:00 PM Our Basketball Team Will Fight the Philippines Whether There is Hope for a Championship Depends on This One Battle Volleyball Also Against the Philippines Baseball Against Japan Track and Field and Swimming Rescheduled for Today <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, all competitions were suspended due to rain. All track and field, swimming, and tennis volleyball games from yesterday have been postponed to today. In addition, there will be a second game of China-Japan baseball and a China-Philippines basketball game. It was found that China and the Philippines first met on the 15th, and our team was behind 12 to 26 in the first half. The game was stopped due to a dispute in the second half. The game will be canceled and rescheduled for a replay. Tonight's China-Philippines game is worth noting. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Track and Field Four Countries 2:30 PM</p>
<p>Swimming Four Countries 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Basketball China-Philippines 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Volleyball China-Philippines 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Baseball China-Japan 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Tennis Japan-Philippines 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Martial Arts Performance 8:00 PM</p>
<p>(Central News Agency Manila 17th) In the China-Philippines basketball game, since the referee did not allow the game to be stopped due to rain on the 15th, causing a dispute, our side filed a protest. The Competition Committee decided on the 16th that the game on the 15th would be invalidated and rescheduled for a replay. The Basketball Committee decided on the 17th that the China-Philippines basketball game would be rescheduled for the evening of the 18th.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency Manila 17th) There are only three days left in the Games, and the winners of each championship are already in sight. Although the Philippines is fighting fiercely in the track and field all-around competition, Japan will definitely win the championship. Japan also has the greatest hope in tennis. The baseball championship has become a Philippine object. Our hope for basketball is still small. We can steadily win the football championship.</p>

<p>Protest Against Women's Volleyball Game Has Been Withdrawn</p>
<p>(Central News Agency Manila 17th) In the China-Philippines women's volleyball game, the refereeing was unfair. The local Chinese and Western newspapers have unanimously criticized it. Our side has withdrawn the protest since the competition is a demonstration nature and we have now won public opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Full Executive Committee Meeting China Proposes Three Items to the Conference <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The Dutch East Indies is Expected to be Absent at That Time</p>
<p>Japan Worries About the Adjournment of the Conference</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's special telegram from Manila on the 17th) The Far Eastern Games full Executive Committee, originally scheduled to be held on the 18th and 19th, has now been delayed by one day and will be held on the 19th and 20th. China's proposals include three items: (1) Regulations on the competition program of the conference; (2) Official interpretation of the conference constitution; (3) Official recognition of winners in track and field.</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency Manila 17th) The regular conference to negotiate the revision of the constitution and the participation of the puppet country has been decided to be held on the 19th and 20th. The Dutch East Indies representatives will return to their country on the 19th and are afraid of being absent on the 20th, so if China does not attend at this time, the conference may be adjourned due to insufficient quorum. The Japanese delegation, fearing that this situation would occur, is seeking a foolproof plan and has decided to propose the issue of revising the constitution on the 19th. However, because China opposes the revision of the constitution, it will definitely use various means to try to obstruct it, so it is still not optimistic whether voting can be carried out on the 19th. As for the agenda of the meeting, it must be notified to the headquarters of the conference before the 17th. Therefore, on this day, the delegation collected the proposed items of each competition group before noon and notified the headquarters of the conference. Also, the attending representatives of each country were decided within the 17th. (Dentsu News Agency Manila 17th) Today, Mr. Iranam announced that the regular conference will be held on the 19th and 20th, saying that the proposals of each country have not yet been collected, and the agenda has not yet been decided. Therefore, Japanese election group staff, including General Representative Hiranuma, held a delegation meeting at the Japanese Club this morning to discuss the attitude to be taken and decide on countermeasures.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Philippine People Bet on the Outcome of Ball Games <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Manila 17th) There are many people here who bet on the outcome of ball games in recent days. In the China-Netherlands football game on the 14th, someone bet 200 pesos that the Dutch East Indies would win. In the Japan-Philippines baseball game on the 15th, the Japanese Consul and the Philippine Mayor each bet 10 cents on the other side's victory. As a result, the Japanese team lost and the Japanese Consul won the bet.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Athletes from the Dutch East Indies Are Scheduled to Return Home on the 19th <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>(Japan United Press Manila 17th) Athletes from the Dutch East Indies are scheduled to depart for their country on the 19th, the day the conference closes. However, because it rained today and was extended by one day, they are considering whether to postpone their departure. However, there will not be a ship returning to the country until one month after the 19th, so it was decided to depart for home on the scheduled date regardless of whether the conference closes or not.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Referee Error Japan Protests <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>High Hurdles and Fifty Meter Freestyle</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency 17th) In the high hurdles preliminary, Adachi Kiyoshi (Japan), who was announced as the third qualifier in Group B, was disqualified for knocking down three hurdles. It has now been announced that Shimizu Kotaro (Japan), who was fourth, has qualified. Shimizu and Garcia (Philippines), who was first, crossed the last hurdle side by side, and slipped and fell due to his feet, resulting in fourth place. He is expected to be active in the final.</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency Manila 17th) In last night's 50-meter freestyle preliminary, Japanese athlete Takahashi won second place, but the referee mistakenly judged him to have failed to qualify. Therefore, the Japanese side today filed a written protest with the headquarters of this association at noon, requesting a rematch. The protest has been submitted to Mr. Hirana, so the conference immediately convened a conference competition committee at the conference headquarters to discuss.</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency Manila 17th) As reported in the previous telegram, the Japanese athlete Adachi Kiyoshi in the high hurdles preliminary was disqualified for knocking down three hurdles, and Shimizu Kotaro was promoted to third place. On the 17th, the Philippine Association reversed the previous judgment, announced that Adachi had qualified, and canceled Shimizu as the third. Therefore, the Japanese side was very angry at the Philippine side's indecision and lodged a serious protest. The Philippine side said that Shimizu had violated other people's routes when he fell, so he was disqualified. As a result, a dispute occurred, but the result was that Japan's protest was accepted, and it was decided that Shimizu would qualify. On the other hand, there has been no response to the issue of swimmer Takahashi (Japan) in the 50-meter preliminary. Philippine Sports Association Director Hirana said that the swimming staff competition committee recognized Takahashi's right to attend the final and decided to have seven people compete in the final. The official reply will be given on the 18th. In addition, the Philippine side's approval or disapproval of Japan's proposal regarding future refereeing methods must be answered in writing, so there is a lot of criticism from all parties for the Philippine side's repeated misjudgments.</p>

<p>All Athletes Get an Unexpected Rest</p>
<p>丨Baseball Matches Will Be Held According to the Original Order丨</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency Manila 17th) Philippine Sports Association Chairman Irana proposed a one-day postponement due to rain today, so all competitions on the 17th were suspended. Tomorrow's program will be held, each extended by one day, continuing until the 20th. As a result, the athletes were able to relax and recover from the fatigue of the continuous hot weather. The Japanese athletes prepared for tomorrow's battle with land swimming and other exercises. After finishing the exercises, they also stayed in their rooms playing cards, looking very idle.</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency Manila 17th) The conference was postponed by one day due to heavy rain. The baseball game will still be held according to the original schedule. The decision is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Grand Arrival of Our Delegation in the Philippines Tens of Thousands of Overseas Chinese Men and Women Welcome Them in the City Li Huitang and Yang Xiuqiong Attracted the Most Attention 丨Sent by Yan Wenchun, Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Manila丨 <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>On the 8th of this month, our election group arrived in Manila on the President McKinley ship of the Dalian Company, which almost shook the entire overseas Chinese community in Manila, so the welcome was worth recording.</p>
<p>(1) The Reception Committee is Busy with Preparations</p>
<p>For social organizations that wanted to join the welcoming party with motorcycles, the committee pre-made hundreds of paper signs and hundreds of small national flags. Each car could receive two paper signs and two small national flags, so two people were specially assigned to distribute the flags and signs the day before yesterday, which was very busy.</p>
<p>(2) President McKinley's Ship Arrived Late</p>
<p>President McKinley's ship did not arrive at the port until 9:50. The chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Secretary Liu Xuesong first took a customs launch out of the dike to board the ship to welcome them. It is estimated that more than 200 cars were prepared by various overseas Chinese organizations and individuals to go to the pier on this day. The Wang family's Taoyuan Hall of the Self-Government Association prepared ten cars. In addition, the Philippine Sports Association prepared twenty large and small cars to specially transport the athletes, doing their best as hosts. After 8 o'clock, nearly 10,000 overseas Chinese men and women voluntarily joined in. Pier No. 7 was so crowded that it was almost impenetrable. When the ship approached the pier, two military bands prepared by the Philippine Sports Association and the military band of the 236th Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts played the welcome song together. For a time, the applause was as loud as thunder.</p>
<p>(3) Order of the Overseas Chinese Welcoming Party</p>
<p>When the music was playing, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth national emblem and the blue flag emblem presented by the Chinese Sports Association and Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng were flying in the ship. General Representative Wang Zhengting and his wife stood under the flag to receive the welcome from the overseas Chinese. The Philippine Miss (overseas Chinese woman) of this year's Carnival led 32 overseas Chinese ladies to present flowers to the general representative and female athletes. Students from the First Overseas Chinese Girls' School then sang the national anthem. While the military music was playing, Wang led the athletes off the ship and out of Pier No. 7, and immediately sat in the car prepared by Philippine Senate President Quezon. Because Quezon had just returned to the Philippines from the United States and was recuperating in Baguio, he specially sent a representative to prepare a car to welcome them to Manila. The rest of the cars followed one after another, first introduced by the chairman of the welcoming committee to the Municipal Bureau to make some courtesy with the mayor. In fact, the mayor also went to the pier to welcome them in person. Then they went to the Governor's Palace to visit the Philippine Governor, and then paraded through the major streets to La Salle College to temporarily unload their luggage and rest. It was already 12 o'clock noon.</p>

<h3 id="e223">(4) Miss Mermaid Shows Greatly Surrounded <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Miss Yang Hsiu-chiung, who won the national women's swimming championship, is known to almost all overseas Chinese women and children. Therefore, when she disembarked, she was greatly surrounded by the audience. Even Filipinos admire her beautiful figure and she is truly worthy of being called the "Mermaid of the Orient." According to Miss Yang's conversation with reporters, this is her first time to the Philippines, and she feels that the weather here is hot, even more so than in South China. Furthermore, the "ball-monster" Li Hui-tang has been to the Philippines seven or eight times. There may be some in the overseas Chinese community who do not know Wang Cheng-ting, but there are hardly any who do not know Li Hui-tang. Therefore, those who wanted to see his demeanor were also eagerly awaiting. Fortunately, Mr. Li is still energetic as ever, so physical educators are celebrating the future of Chinese football. According to Mr. Li, this time, because many great players like Tai Lin-ching could not come together, there will inevitably be some deficiencies in strength. However, the players in the football team are mainly from South China, and they will be able to handle communication more easily. Therefore, there is a great chance of winning in football.</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Wang's Talk with Reporters</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when an important person arrives, newspaper reporters regard it as an excellent source of information, so they inevitably surround them and engage in conversation. Moreover, with the recent bad news from the motherland, the overseas Chinese community wants to know accurate news even more. Mr. Wang is also an outstanding diplomat of more than ten years, so his words are even more important. The most important questions and answers are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Question) This time, Japan wanted to forcibly include its puppet state of "Manchukuo" in the Far Eastern Games, but our side opposed it. Due to the rules of the association, Japan reluctantly participated as before. At this session of the Far Eastern Games, a proposal to amend the constitution will be made at the regular meeting of the Far Eastern Games, and amendments will be implemented with a two-thirds majority vote. The meeting period of the standing committee happens to be within the period of the Far Eastern Games. If Japan achieves its goal, how will we deal with it? Will we immediately withdraw from the competition, or will we end on a "happy" note? (Answer) Our country has always opposed Japan's forced inclusion of the puppet "Manchukuo"... and we have never approved of it. When the Japanese representative Yamamoto Tadaoki arrived in Shanghai that day, he made this request, but I refuted him with one sentence. I asked Yamamoto, where is Manchukuo? I really don't know where Manchukuo is, how can I vote? For example, if we talk about Mr. Zheng, I should first know where Mr. Zheng is from and when he was born before I can discuss Mr. Zheng's affairs. This is very clear, so there is no need to elaborate. (Question) China and the Philippines have close relations, and the Philippines is about to become independent. It is said that Mr. Wang's visit to the Philippines this time, in addition to leading the Chinese team to participate in the Far Eastern Games and attending the Far Eastern Games Standing Committee, also has other missions, such as discussing trade and other diplomatic matters with the Philippine authorities. Is that correct? (Answer) The relationship between China and the Philippines is indeed close, but it will take at least fifteen years for the Philippines to achieve independence. It seems too early to talk about trade or other diplomatic matters at this time. Continuing, this time is just preparation. I and Philippine Senate President Quezon are old friends of many years and are like-minded. We can talk about everything with each other, but it is discussed in private friendship, not formal negotiations. (Question) When Quezon returned to Manila via Shanghai, the doctor hosted a banquet and discussed what issues? (Answer) We did not discuss any issues, it was just a reception. (Question) Japanese Ambassador to China Arima Akira recently went to Nanjing to meet with Wang Jingwei and Huang Fu to discuss Sino-Japanese affairs. Afterwards, they went to Shanghai for consultations, and then the Japanese ambassador returned to Japan to report. Is there already certainty about the opening of traffic in North China? (Answer) This matter is not very clear. (Question) The Japanese said that the Tanggu Agreement stipulates the opening of traffic between North China and the puppet state. Is that correct? (Answer) Absolutely not. (Question) Have you seen the Tanggu Agreement, Doctor? (Answer) I have seen it. (Question) Then what is the content? (Answer) The same as what is published in the newspapers. (Question) After Japan issued a new declaration on its policy towards China, it aroused reactions from European and American countries. The National Government has issued two declarations of opposition. Has this matter ended? (Answer) There is still much that can be done, the key is how to do it. I think Wang Jingwei is an important figure in the party and the country, and he will definitely not be willing to lose China's sovereignty. We should cooperate with him so that he can concentrate on serving the country. Even Mr. Chiang is not someone who would cede sovereignty and humiliate the country. (Question) It is said that Wang Jingwei recently invited the doctor to Beijing and will ask the doctor to reassume the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Is this true? (Answer) This is not true. (Question) You recently went to Peiping and heard that the situation there is very dangerous. Is that correct? (Answer) There is no such thing as dangerous or not dangerous. The situation in China is dangerous, not just in North China. Isn't South China the same? If the Japanese land in Guangdong with 20,000 or 30,000 heavy troops, can we resist them? At this point, the reporters saw that Mr. Wang was coughing frequently and looked very tired. Not wanting to disturb him further, they bid farewell and left.</p>
<h3 id="e224">General Description of the Situation of Various Championships The Philippines Has Already Won the Volleyball Championship Our Country Still Has Little Hope for Basketball <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the sixth day of the 10th Far Eastern Games. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and it rained heavily all day. All competitions were suspended, causing track and field, swimming, etc. to be unable to end as scheduled. The conference had no choice but to extend it by one day. Although the various championships have not yet reached the end, the situation has been determined and the clues are already there. A general description is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e225">Football <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Since our country drew with Japan three to three in the last session and shared the championship, the people were very indignant. In this session, we must win. In the first match against the Philippines, we won two to zero, but it felt very difficult. It was thought that the match against the newly joined strong team of the Dutch East Indies would not be optimistic, and everyone had doubts. During this period of doubt, the Dutch East Indies defeated Japan seven to one, thinking that the Dutch East Indies was avenging our country, which made people very happy. On the one hand, it also made people very apprehensive, because with such a score, even our country would feel that there was more danger than good luck. Unexpectedly, our army also won the second match against the Dutch East Indies with two to zero. Thus, fear turned into optimism. It is assumed that the mediocre Japanese army will not be our opponent. However, in the match between Japan and the Philippines, although the Philippines took the lead with three to one in the first half, Japan scored three goals in the second half, and the situation changed. The Philippine army still lost. The Japanese army's endurance and fighting spirit should not be underestimated. Our army still cannot rest easy. We only hope for a draw, then the championship will also be ours.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Basketball <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Our country's hopes for the basketball team were not strong. Judging from the two losses to Japan in the last session and the fact that Japan also defeated the Philippines once, it is natural that the hope of winning this time is even slimmer. Before the team went abroad, the encouragement of public opinion made the players realize that they must avenge their previous defeats. Sure enough, in the first match, they defeated Japan forty-two to twenty-six. After that, the Philippine army also defeated the short army with fifty-one to thirty-five. Seeing this score, the hopes of our army increased sharply. When the time for the first match between China and the Philippines arrived, enthusiastic people in the country were all waiting with bated breath. When the telegram arrived in Shanghai, in the first half, our army lost to the Philippine army by a large margin of twelve to twenty-six. In the second half, because of the heavy rain, our side requested to stop the game, but the referee did not agree and instead ruled that our team had forfeited. The referee's unreasonable pressure was unbearable, so we protested. After deliberation by the competition committee, it was decided to overturn the referee's decision and reschedule the game for the 20th. However, looking at the situation of the second match between China and Japan, our army was fortunate to rely on Wang Yuzeng's throw in the last ten seconds to defeat Japan again with forty-eight to forty-seven. It was indeed not without a surplus of energy. Without Mr. Wang's goal, wouldn't we have lost to the Japanese army with forty-six to forty-seven? Seeing this, although we defeated Japan and avenged our previous defeats, the basketball championship, which the Philippines regards as a forbidden fruit, is probably not our country's business.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Volleyball <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Everyone thought that volleyball, which had the most confidence in retaining the championship, was not only defeated by the Philippines, but was also eaten up by Japan, opening up an unprecedented disastrous defeat for Chinese volleyball in the history of the Far Eastern Games. It was shocking and disheartening. The Philippines first defeated Japan three to one, and our country defeated Japan three to two. Based on this calculation, our country should only be an enemy of the Philippines. However, how could we know that we would lose to the Philippines in a straight three? And how could we expect that in the second match between China and Japan, Japan would avenge us with three to one? In the second match between Japan and the Philippines, the Philippines won again with three to one. Thus, the Philippine team has three wins in three matches. In the last match against our country, no matter how we win or lose, the championship has already become the Philippine team's possession.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Tennis <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Our country's defeat in tennis is an inevitable situation. The prior expectation that we could hope to win the championship again after the eighth session was just a nervous and overly confident idea. It should be known that the level of tennis between China and Japan is far apart. Although their first- and second-rate players go to Europe to attend the Davis Cup and other international competitions, their third- and fourth-rate players are enough to defeat our country's first-rate talents with plenty to spare. If Japan does not send out reserve members Jou Shou-chiao and Yamada, how can Hsu Cheng-shen even be able to compete for a ray of glory? Sato Hyosuke, who was defeated by our country's Lin Pao-hua and Chiu Fei-hai at the eighth Far Eastern Games in Shanghai, now that he has reunited with Mr. Chiu, Sato was quite afraid of Chiu Fei-hai before the game. But when the game started, Sato was very disappointed, unexpectedly Chiu's skills had deteriorated so much. The Chiu Fei-hai after seven years is still the same as before. Sato's disappointment is actually laughing at the Chinese players for being too depressed. We really have nothing to comfort ourselves with. As for the situation of the finals between Japan and the Philippines, Japan's Sato again won all two singles matches. Even if Yamada loses all matches, Japan will definitely win the doubles, and the championship will be stably won by Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Baseball <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Our country's baseball is just to go through the motions. It is enough to have a good performance. The Philippines this time restored players from the league, which was always considered professional, to amateur status and participated, and their strength increased sharply. And in view of the consecutive defeats to our country in the previous two sessions (our country was represented by overseas Chinese from Honolulu) and falling to third place, they vowed to avenge their shame. Judging from the strength of the Philippine team in this session, there is indeed a possibility of winning the championship. Japan is also left behind. In the first match between our country and the Philippines, the Philippines won with twenty-five to one. The Philippines got fifteen hits, and our country also got seven, but the errors were as many as nine. The performance was not necessarily good. In the second match, our country played against Japan, and only three errors were found, but we lost with one to twenty. In the first match between Japan and the Philippines, Japan was defeated with zero runs. The strange skills of the Philippine pitcher caused the Japanese team's batting to fail completely. In the nine innings, Japan only had the opportunity to reach second base three or four times. It can be seen that the Philippine team is strong, and it is difficult for Japan to retain the championship. In the second match between China and the Philippines, the Philippines sent out second-rate characters, and we lost again with fourteen to zero. In the second match between Japan and the Philippines, Japan will probably still lose badly.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Track and Field <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Our country has made special progress in track and field, but compared with Japan and the Philippines, it is still between a hundred steps and ten steps. If we can score points, our wish has been fulfilled. However, Liu Changchun, who was regarded as the most promising, was eliminated in the preliminary rounds of both short runs, both finishing fourth. Mr. Liu has come to Shanghai several times, but he has never shown his skills. Even in this preliminary track and field selection in our country and the confrontation between China and the West, he did not easily appear. Mr. Liu said that he had a leg injury. Could it be that his leg will never heal? People in the country felt that he was conserving his energy and preparing for the Far Eastern Games to bring glory to the country. But now that he has retired like this, it can be said to be the greatest regret of Mr. Liu's life. No wonder our country's track and field races cannot score points. In the field events, Wu Bixian's high jump of 1.83 meters won fourth place, which was a big surprise. It was not expected by the people of the country, and Mr. Wu himself should also regard it as an unexpected honor. For other events, such as Chen Pao-chiu's shot put, there is only a slim hope, and if Fu Pao-lu's pole vault can get one point, it would also be fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e231">All-Around <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Our country is steadily winning the third place in the two relay events, because the Dutch East Indies has players in the pentathlon and decathlon, but no relay team. Wang Chi-huai's pentathlon and Chang Ling-chia's decathlon may have a glimmer of hope.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Swimming <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Swimming is a specialty of Japan. Although the Philippines has two or three special talents, it is difficult to shake their property. Our country's players are too far apart, and the total defeat is expected. However, the relay swim also counts as points. Our country is steadily in last place (third) and can also get four points. Because Japanese women did not participate in women's swimming, our country's women were able to shine and bring glory to our men.</p>

<h3 id="e233">(6) Mr. Wang's Declaration to Overseas Chinese <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>This time, Cheng-ting led our country's team to the Philippines to attend the Far Eastern Games, and I am very grateful for the warm welcome from all sectors of the overseas Chinese community. This spirit not only shows the overseas Chinese community's love for the motherland, but also encourages the courage of the team. More than 130 members of the team who came to the Philippines were selected from the teams from all over the country. Their strength is stronger than ever before. In various competitions, such as football, basketball, and volleyball, the teams are all domestic elites and are quite confident. As for track and field events, although there is no hope of winning the championship, the results are better than in the previous sessions. All events have teams participating this time, because the purpose of sports is to train a healthy body and cultivate a spirit of cooperation. The championship is secondary. Therefore, even if we know that the competition items have no hope, we will not give up. Our country has made a lot of progress in sports recently, and the government's support is also unwavering. For example, the construction cost of the National Games held in the capital last year reached more than 1.5 million yuan. And Shanghai will also spend more than 1 million yuan to build the most complete venue for the National Games and the 11th Far Eastern Games in four years. In addition, the provinces and regions in the north and south also hold them on time and in different places, because we really want to make the people in all places universally interested in sports and make all cities build complete venues once and for all for the needs of practice. A strong physique is not achieved overnight, and good results must be trained from childhood. European and American powers all excel in sports. Only because they are good at sports can the spirit of cooperation be fully expressed. A strong country must first have a strong race. The education authorities in the country, in view of this, have set training standards for children's sports. There are not a few overseas Chinese here, and I deeply hope that the parents and teachers of overseas Chinese children will also pay attention to it. The Philippine sports authorities have spared no effort in the planning before the meeting and the reception of the team, and all facilities are very complete. I would like to add a few words to express my gratitude.</p>

<p>Staff Member Deng Zezhao's Rude Attitude</p>
<p>All Newspapers Refuse to Publish News</p>
<p>丨Heavy Rain! Postponed Competition丨</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Hankou, 17th) During the 17th Central China Games, an insult occurred to newspaper reporters. The staff member Deng Zezhao, who was hired by the conference, was a scout cadre of the Provincial Party Department. His attitude was rude and repeatedly embarrassed the press. The entire body of reporters resolved that they could not interview the news of the conference and would absolutely not publish it.</p>
<p>Hankou telegram, the 5th Central China Games was grandly held at the Wuchang Public Sports Ground on the morning of the 16th. At the opening ceremony, the athletes from Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi all lined up to participate. The Honorary President of the Conference, Zhang Xueliang, the Honorary Vice President, Zhang Qun, the President of the Conference, Cheng Qibao, and others all arrived at the venue first. At the time, Zhang Xueliang led all the staff members and the four provincial teams for a week-long parade around the venue. The military band led the way, and the athletes followed. The green grass was like a carpet, and the clear sky was like a curtain, adding a lot to the conference. After the parade, the opening of the conference was announced, the flag was raised, and cannons were fired. The representatives of each team declared, and planes circled in the sky, distributing various leaflets. Then, the chairman, Cheng Qibao, delivered an opening speech, saying that the Central China Games has a history of eleven years, and Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi have taken turns holding it. However, after the fourth session, it was extended due to the situation. Fortunately, with the support of all parties, this session of the Games can be carried out smoothly, which is very gratifying. Now that the conference has opened today, I deeply hope that all athletes will work hard and bring color to Central China, etc. Next, Zhang Qun, representing Honorary President Chiang Kai-shek, read the training instructions, "A strong physique and full spirit are the mother of all undertakings. The success or failure of an individual's future depends on this, and the rise and fall of the nation's future depends on this. Our country's reputation as the 'Sick Man of Asia,' its long-standing weakness, and its being bullied, and the frequent banditry and severe poisoning in the four provinces of Central China, are the responsibilities of all those who grow up in this country and on this land, and all should regard it as the greatest shame. You students are representatives of the strong and healthy youth of Central China. You gather in one place to learn from each other, and you echo the 10th Far Eastern Games being held in the Philippines, which makes it even more meaningful to learn from each other. I hope that you students will abide by the rules of sports, and further cultivate the morality of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame. Be self-reliant and persevere, and infuse the spirit of sports into your daily life. All actions, including food, clothing, housing, and transportation, must conform to the six major principles of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and certainty. In schools, lead your classmates to revitalize. In society, be the vanguard of transforming the atmosphere. I hope that you will universally develop and accumulate strength, and complete the mission of promoting sports. This is what Zhongzheng most eagerly expects of you students. May you all work hard." Next, Honorary President Zhang Xueliang gave a speech. Honorary Vice President Zhang Qun gave a speech, saying that the four provinces are related in terms of geography, politics, and culture, and suffer the same pain from the spread of banditry. He hoped that they would learn from each other and cooperate thoroughly. Finally, Wang Wei-chun, the representative from Hubei Province, replied on behalf of the athletes, sincerely accepting the instructions from the presidents. After the speech, more than 3,000 Boy Scouts performed group exercises and dispersed. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the competition will begin, but due to heavy rain, it could not be held. Cheng Qibao announced that it would be postponed by one day. On this day, the athletes from each province wore homespun clothes and were full of spirit. However, the female athletes from Hubei wore goose-yellow short clothes and green skirts, which had a fairy-like appearance and were the most eye-catching in the entire venue. In terms of technique, each has its own advantages, so it is not yet known who will win. The highest records of the Central China Games in the past are recorded below: Men's Division: (1) Track and Field: 100 meters 12 seconds, 200 meters 25 seconds, 400 meters 57.9 seconds, 800 meters, 2 minutes 15.6 seconds, 1500 meters, 4 minutes 48.6 seconds, 10,000 meters, 37 minutes 46.4 seconds, (2) Field: Shot Put 11.60 meters, Discus 29.04 meters, Javelin 41.01 meters, High Jump, 5.6 feet, Long Jump 5.69 meters, Pole Vault 2.885 meters, Triple Jump 11.83 meters, (3) All-Around: 1600-meter Relay, 3 minutes 56.7 seconds, Pentathlon 2065 points, Decathlon 3570 points, (4) Swimming: 50 meters 35.6 seconds, 100 meters 1 minute 23.6 seconds, 400 meters 8 minutes 17 seconds, 100 meters Backstroke missing, 1500 meters 39 minutes 46 seconds, 200 meters Breaststroke 2 minutes 11.8 seconds, 200-meter Relay 2 minutes 2 minutes 6 seconds.

The future results must be even more impressive.</p>

<p>The First All-Shanghai Open Handball Tournament initiated by the West YMCA has gradually become tense. The Chinese participants include Zhu Kuan, Sun Daosheng, and Xia Zeren in singles, and Zhu Kuan and Hong Yu-kui in doubles. The singles championship seems to be a competition between Zhu Kuan and Ke Kejin, while Zhu Hong are the most promising in doubles, followed by Ke Lamai and Ma Luofu. Yesterday, Zhu Hong's consecutive victories over Ke and Bao in two games of doubles made their goal of winning the championship even closer. Today, Sun Daosheng's singles match against Ke Lamai will definitely be a struggle. When Ke Lamai dominated the West YMCA handball tournament the year before last, he was defeated by Sun. Last year, Sun was defeated by Ke Lamai. Currently, the two are evenly matched in skill. In terms of physical strength, Sun is far inferior.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Foreign News: Siam Seals Overseas Chinese Schools <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Fifteen Overseas Chinese Schools Unjustifiably Closed</p>
<p>Many Chinese Teachers Forced to Leave</p>
<p>| Account of Mr. Huang Chengguan, Teacher at Nanyang Middle School in Siam |</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Chengguan, the Director of Studies at Nanyang Middle School in Siam, has recently returned from Siam. According to Mr. Huang, since the People's Party took power in the Siamese government, there has been a new political atmosphere, and progress has also been made in education. However, there are many overseas Chinese in the area, so the Siamese Ministry of Education has also paid close attention to overseas Chinese education. In recent years, various overseas Chinese schools in Siam, in order to develop overseas Chinese education, have mostly invited teachers from the motherland to teach. Therefore, overseas Chinese education has been flourishing. Unexpectedly, this has aroused the jealousy of the Siamese Ministry of Education. The Siamese believe that the more developed overseas Chinese education is, the more disadvantageous it is to Siamese education. Therefore, the Siamese are constantly trying to prevent the development of overseas Chinese education. For example, last year they implemented compulsory education, forcing overseas Chinese children aged ten to fourteen to study Siamese for 21 hours and 15 minutes per week. This year, they have gone even further, closing as many as 15 overseas Chinese schools for no reason in less than half a month. Not only that, but they have also tried to force Chinese teachers with superior knowledge to resign, such as by setting a deadline for taking the Siamese language exam (stipulating that those who have not taken the Siamese language exam may not become teachers), or by threatening the principals of overseas Chinese schools to force them to resign (the principals of overseas Chinese schools are appointed by the school founders and are elders who know Siamese; the Siamese Ministry of Education legally recognizes only the principals as the owners of the school's rights, so the principals have the power to dismiss Chinese principals and teachers). For example, Mr. Huang Chengguan was forced to return to China by the principal. Mr. Huang had worked in the Normal Department of Huanghun School in Siam. At that time, Siam was implementing compulsory education. Mr. Huang had suggested in various Chinese newspapers that the overseas Chinese should reform education, and he attacked the Siamese compulsory education regulations as unsuitable for overseas Chinese children. Therefore, he aroused the jealousy of the Siamese Ministry of Education and was warned by the Siamese Ministry of Education. Later, the overseas Chinese's opposition to compulsory education failed, and Mr. Huang also left Huanghun School and turned to founding Nanyang Middle School, an overseas Chinese school. However, the Siamese Ministry of Education never forgot about Mr. Huang. Recently, the Siamese Ministry of Education suddenly closed 15 overseas Chinese schools. The Siamese Ministry of Education was deeply afraid that Mr. Huang would rise up again to oppose it. In order to take preemptive action, they threatened the principal of Nanyang Middle School to force Mr. Huang to hand over the administrative power of the school to a Siamese principal, threatening to suspend the school if Mr. Huang did not leave. For the sake of the school, Mr. Huang could not bear to see the school suspended because of him, so he resolutely left the school and returned to China voluntarily. The Siamese Ministry of Education's oppression of various overseas Chinese schools is now in full swing.</p>

<p>Female Students Exempt from Military Training</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) According to military training officers who came to Beiping from Beijing, the central government has decided to actively reorganize student soldiers. The General Inspectorate of Military Training has reached an agreement with the Ministry of Education that 100,000 graduates from high schools and above nationwide this year must enlist in military training. The training period is three months and does not conflict with their future academic prospects. Graduating students from various provinces in North China will enlist in Beiping, students from Central China will enlist in Wuhan, and students from South China will enlist in Nanjing. Female students from coeducational high schools and girls' middle schools are exempt from military training. Those who voluntarily enlist will be allowed. It is reported that female students from Northeastern University have received military training and many have voluntarily enlisted.</p>
<p>Still not weak, and the various overseas Chinese schools, because they have never been united, are mostly unable to survive. It is hoped that the motherland will provide deep assistance to the overseas Chinese in the area.</p>

<p>Here are a few important plans that the Ministry of Education has recently made regarding higher education universities: (1) Allocating Boxer Indemnity Funds to Designate Several Universities to Conduct Research: It is rumored that a decision will be made after the summer vacation this year to designate several universities to start this work.

As for how many universities will be designated to run first, and which university will run which subject, the Ministry of Education, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees, and the Sino-American Cultural Foundation Committee will consult and follow the principles decided by the joint conference of the Boxer Indemnity agencies. The Ministry of Education hopes to designate more schools to open. In the future, the number of schools and subjects to be held will depend on the financial situation and the progress of the negotiations (consultations with the Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees, etc.). (2) The Ministry of Education previously hired medical education committee members to draft medical curriculum standards. They are currently drafting them and will complete the draft before the summer vacation as soon as possible.

<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng is very enthusiastic about education, especially about the recently popular production education, which he deeply sympathizes with and supports. Wu contributed a lot to the establishment of the Dagong Vocational School in this city. Because the school's affairs are developing well, it has decided to build a new school in the next semester. Therefore, yesterday, Wu, in his capacity as chairman of the board, hosted a banquet at the Municipal Government for all members of the school board. Director Pan of the Education Bureau also attended and provided guidance.

<h3 id="e258">On the Use of Literary Chinese in Elementary School Textbooks, the Requirement of Reading Mencius in Junior High School, and Various Criticisms of Vernacular Chinese (2) <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yanyin</p>
<p>(6) Mr. Wang said, "One word in literary Chinese conveys the spirit, while dozens of words in vernacular Chinese often fail to express the meaning. Although learning literary Chinese is more difficult, the benefits in the future will surely be many times greater." Education should pay attention to the results, but it should also consider the process. Spending "ten years at the window, only then to understand literary Chinese," can this ten years of effort not be counted in the economic account? Moreover, writing in literary Chinese is mostly incomprehensible, while writing in vernacular Chinese is easy to create. This is also a fact. In the imperial examination era, of those so-called young scholars who specialized in literary Chinese, how many were truly fluent after ten years at the window? Taking Jiangyin as an example, there were many examinees where the "inspector of studies" was stationed, but of the thousands who took the exam, no more than a hundred were truly fluent. The result of reading literary Chinese can be imagined. Mr. Wang has been a middle school principal, and middle schools must emphasize literary Chinese. I ask, among high school graduates, how many out of ten are able to convey the spirit of literary Chinese with one word, and reap the benefits of literary Chinese? The process is very difficult, and the results are not easily good. How can one talk about benefits?</p>
<p>7.  Mr. Wang lamented the commodification of textbooks and the use of animal language, which could lead to a disaster like the burning of books. I don't know if commodification or animal language causes the disaster, or if commodification and animal language together cause the disaster. According to Mr. Wang, stories containing allegorical meanings such as "The Mouse Invites Guests" and "The Cat and Dog Hold a Meeting" can be applied to eight-year-old children. Then animal language is not forbidden. If a renowned figure in the education world is able to advocate this view, then the social world can agree. Otherwise, if one does not look at whether the animal language in the textbooks has any allegorical meaning at all, and says "abuse of imagination, without experiencing it," then the so-called "pushing the wave and adding to the billows" is no wonder that outsiders to education deeply resent it blindly. As for the commodification of textbooks, it is difficult to avoid under free competition in buying and selling. If the system is slightly changed, I think the trend can be slightly curbed. Moreover, the commodification of textbooks and the use of animal language are really two separate issues from literary Chinese and vernacular Chinese. Literary Chinese textbooks can also add animal language materials, and they can also be commodified. "Our country's books about gods and ghosts fill many houses." Qian Bao Sou Shen, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio... are they not all in literary Chinese? Commodified books can really fill five carts. It has been like this for a long time. In the imperial examination era, the grand themes and small themes, and various literary Chinese textbooks before the tenth year of the Republic, were they not all commodified? Taking the classics as an example, Zuo Zhuan has many articles about gods and ghosts, and the Thirteen Classics also have many cases of falsehoods and errors. How can one blame vernacular textbooks alone for animal language and commodification? If vernacular textbooks are enough to start a disaster like the burning of books, then literary Chinese textbooks and all ancient books are enough to start a disaster like the burning of books. I also have an extreme argument: even if the disaster of the burning of books reappears today, there is no need for me to compromise and change vernacular Chinese to literary Chinese. Because if the nature of a book or an argument is wrong, it is not a pity to burn it. If it is right, the blame is not on me. Did Qin Shihuang burn books because the books themselves caused the disaster?</p>
<p>In short, Mr. Wang's argument still seems to be standing on the education world. Although it is slightly biased, it is still the view of one school. Mr. Wang's criticism of vernacular Chinese seems to be outside the education world. Not only are there self-contradictory points, but it also seems to be advocating for "old-fashioned scholars." The attacks of "old-fashioned scholars" outside the education world are not to be feared, but the internal strife within the education world is truly to be feared. Because a renowned figure like Mr. Wang, who has a great reputation in the education world, has actually made this statement, the "old-fashioned scholars" will surely seize it and argue more vigorously. Li Si used the saying of Xun Qing to accomplish Qin Shihuang's perverse acts. Then the disaster of the burning of books was not started by vernacular Chinese, but by Mr. Wang's statement. Does Mr. Wang want to bear this responsibility? I have not expressed my opinion for a long time. I really don't have time to express it, because I value Mr. Wang's statement and cannot help but argue. I did not have time to correct any inappropriate rhetoric. Please forgive Mr. Wang, and please educate the gentlemen of the national education world. (The End)</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, strictly speaking, among the ministers who accompanied the Empress Dowager to Fengtian this time, only Xunling and Qingshan could truly be considered ministers. The rest, frankly, didn't deserve the title. But I think it's only fair to call them accompanying ministers, otherwise it would be unjust. Because I feel that the duties of this group of people are exactly the same, except that when meeting the Empress Dowager, Qingshan and Xunling always stood in the front, there was no other difference. Speaking of standing positions, we have to praise the value of titles. Although I have repeatedly said before that titles are a mere formality and have no practical benefit, when meeting the Empress Dowager, my second brother relied on his title of Duke to always stand in front of Qingshan, even closer to the Empress Dowager. This treatment was considered a great honor at that time. Qingshan was a male housekeeper in the Qing Palace, and he could probably manage everything a male housekeeper could manage. My second brother was like an adjutant to the Empress Dowager, without actual power, but his position was always higher than that of a male housekeeper, so he could stand in front of Qingshan.</p>
<p>Along the way, our train would often be ordered to stop because the Empress Dowager was in a good mood. Whenever the train stopped, Qingshan and Xunling, leading a group of "accompanying ministers," had to come forward to serve her. The Empress Dowager knew almost everyone's names, official titles, and brief personal histories. Although she didn't seem to pay much attention to them when they stood before her, none of their clothes and manners could escape her keen eyes.</p>
<p>"They are all dressed very luxuriously!" she often lamented. "Their extravagance and official airs can indeed add a lot of fun to our journey!" (36)</p>
<h3 id="e260">大肚皮 <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Every year I see the Qingming Festival, I always see four executioners, with two pheasant feathers inserted in their heads, wearing red satin jackets and trousers. Those people are all fair-skinned, fat bellied, and swaggering on the road; it is said that they are the owners of meat shops, born to kill pigs from childhood, so they are all famous butchers!</p>
<p>I say big belly, it is not necessary to be an executioner. I often see people sitting in the car, their bodies leaning back, their belly like a bent bow covering them, forming an extreme arc. Isn't this, to put it elegantly, called a fat merchant? Those who have studied know that Wang Xizhi used to be fat bellied, exposing his belly on the eastern bed, and could get a beautiful woman and become a happy son-in-law, how wonderful. Su Dongpo also had a big belly, and every time he finished eating, he had to move slowly. One day, he touched his belly and asked the maid, "What is inside?" Someone replied, "Articles and economics." Only his concubine Chao Yun retorted, "Scholar, you have a belly full of untimely things." Su Dongpo had to hold his belly and laugh. What a romantic affair! Not only these two people, but also when Grand Tutor Dang finished eating, he also pointed to his belly and said, "I will not let you down." His subordinates said, "The general will not let down his belly, this belly will let down the general, and has not contributed much wisdom." Bian Xiaoxian once wanted to sleep during the day, and his disciples mocked him, "Bian Xiaoxian has a big belly, is too lazy to read, and only wants to sleep." Xiaoxian replied, "Bian is my surname, Xiao is my name, big belly, a container for the Five Classics." These two felt that not only their bellies were big, but also their capacity was very large. This is unattainable!</p>
<p>The ancients said: A prime minister's belly is good for rowing a boat. This is also used to describe his generosity, so he can manage the universe, govern the country and secure the people. If we talk about it now: that belly is too small, it really can't hold anything, and there are more knots inside, which makes people unpredictable, making everyone deceive each other, and no one doesn't have their own ideas, causing trouble. What else? The belly is big, hum! Either they are full of money, or they are pregnant, secretly suffering from a ten-month illness, still not as good as the executioner swaggering on the road!</p>

<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The countryside is really lonely! The guys who "work at sunrise and rest at sunset" have nowhere to go except sneak out to a small teahouse during their farming breaks.</p>
<p>What's so fun about a small teahouse? A low, humble house, with a few broken tables and a few long benches. Purple clay teapots and crude porcelain bowls, definitely not brewed with the best tea leaves such as Yuqian or Oolong. But in the morning and evening, a house full of people, the sound of conversations filling the seats, and the smell of cigarettes temporarily change the silent air of the countryside.</p>
<p>The old fathers, with pipes in their mouths and tightly furrowed brows, emit a "singing the past, lamenting the future" tone from their dry throats. The middle-aged uncles inquire about the price of rice and the rise and fall of vegetable prices, as concerned as speculators doing "buying short" and "selling short." The young guys smoke cigarettes and drink strong tea, talking about the scenery of Shanghai. What are the women in Shanghai like? What are the gambling, wine, food, and dramas like in Shanghai? They can't wait to immediately grow wings and fly to Shanghai to experience the prosperous life there.</p>
<p>The old man in the teahouse, while "huffing and puffing" the bellows, fanning the tea stove, is also talking about "Li's aunt in the east village, who is good at having affairs, was caught by her husband last night. Wang Amao in the west lane, who got drunk on spirits, slept on the grave for a night, and today has a severe fever, probably possessed by a wild ghost." He is a "wireless radio" in the countryside; he can also be called a "wordless newspaper," so many people run here, loving to listen to his news.</p>
<p>The countryside is really too lonely! This small teahouse is a lively place in a lonely world.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 28 A Coincidence for Viewing, A Concern for Illness by Handing a Handkerchief, and a Misunderstanding of a Letter</p>
<p>Guizhi, I suddenly understand now that the opportunities of the golden age, although they have been missed, as long as we understand each other, it is not difficult to comfort each other in spirit, right? Okay, I can only write this far. Because I wrote this letter very carefully, so as not to cause any misunderstandings. I wrote and tore, tore and wrote, and have already torn up twenty or so sheets of letter paper. I was also afraid that you wouldn't recognize cursive script, so I wrote in regular script, neatly. Just look at this point, you can know how important I think this letter is. I hope that when you receive this letter, you will read it carefully several times, and then reply to me. It would be even better if we could arrange to meet in person somewhere. I hope this is not too much to ask, right? Wishing you well! Your friend, Gan Jizhi</p>
<p>After writing this letter, Jizhi wrote "To be opened personally by Ms. Yang Guizhi" on the envelope, put it in his inner pocket, and went to bed. When he woke up on the pillow the next day, the first thought that came to his mind was, how should this letter be delivered to Guizhi's hands? Sending it by the post office is definitely inappropriate, because he was afraid that it would fall into the hands of Old Zhao. Let the maid deliver it? That would require at least one more person to participate in this secret. After thinking about it, the only way is to personally deliver it to Guizhi's hands. As for what method to use to personally deliver it to Guizhi's hands, this is not something that can be solved in one day, so he had to wait for an opportunity. He made such a decision, and delayed leaving for two days. He would loiter at the gate several times a day. On the afternoon of the second day, he actually encountered Guizhi coming to the gate. He didn't have time to consider everything else. He bowed from afar, took out the letter, and stretched out his hand to hand it over. When Guizhi saw him handing over the letter, her heart was already pounding wildly. She originally intended not to receive it, but she was afraid that it would be delayed and others would see it, so she had to take the letter, immediately stuff it into her pocket, and her face turned red.

<p>In the past, I wrote the Ice Spring poem and echoed the words of Huifeng. (Commissioned by Monk Jin Su) In the blink of an eye, forty years have passed. Marquis Qian came south yesterday to discuss the secluded interest of daytime. (You sent me the Red Leaf Pavilion picture and inscription by Huifeng's son and Han) To write the beauty of Lonely Mountain, deep affection entrusted to the brush, carefully selected bristles, fragrant paper that will not be eaten by worms. Also mentioned the virtuous men of Guilin, Dezhu and Wenju. Emerald green sprinkled on pine fat, scarlet carved into flower milk. The secret of Beiyuan is passed down, the method of Xiling can be followed. Suddenly, under the fragrant eaves, strange lights appear like phoenixes and luan. I am ashamed that my humble talent is not up to par, tracing back the lingering sound of cold wild geese. (Huifeng and Jiangcun had a Wild Geese Sound Gathering) I am old in the rivers and lakes, what more can I admire about my humble life? Nostalgia shares the same heart, I cannot bear to leave. A farmhouse remains outside the city (You have a villa in the northern suburbs of Guangzhou), when will I return to travel? Friendship is formed east and west of the mountains, trimming vegetables and getting drunk in the wind and dew.</p>

<p>— Lin Yuewei</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Lanshi, with moral integrity and literary talent, was highly respected throughout the country, and lived in seclusion in Shanghai, enjoying himself with poetry and wine. He used to live on North Sichuan Road, Keming Road, and often visited me, talking about poetry and drinking wine, free and unrestrained, often hiring prostitutes to serve wine, listening to songs and dancing, and the excitement was even greater. I once impromptu composed two poems on the spot: "Drunk in the Qionglou night drink, why refuse, there are famous flowers in the seat to illuminate the wine disaster, afraid to listen to Qiu Niang's Golden Thread Song, the green shirt has delayed my youth." "Happy flowers accompany the brocade feast, the fragrance at the bottom of the bracelet floats in the wine cup, the madness of the old Fanchuan has not diminished, and I am happy not to come to the wine." Mr. admired the last sentence very much, chanting it over and over again. I edited the Zhongshe magazine, and Mr. wrote tens of thousands of words of poetry, and there are still manuscripts that have not been published. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Mr. moved to Fuli Road, and meetings became rare. Now that the spring is bright and beautiful, I was planning to visit Mr. and have a good time, but unexpectedly, the bad news came that Mr. had returned to Daoshan, and a wise man had passed away. How can I bear the grief! Therefore, I wrote a couplet to mourn him, saying: "His romantic nature is like Bai Tai Chuan, and his unrestrainedness is comparable to Lu Fangweng. He loves wine and poetry, and lives in seclusion in the lakes and seas for half his life." "His longevity surpasses Rong Qiqi, and his nobility rivals Tao Jingjie. Why envy becoming an immortal or a Buddha? His writings are immortal for thousands of years." I also wrote a couplet on behalf of the Confucian Church, saying: "The holy religion civilizes the barbarians, and lectures in Berlin. You were shocked by your outstanding reputation at a young age, and the commoner could sway the princes and ministers." "Consign emotions to poetry and wine, and hide in Shanghai. It is sighable that his life was bleak, and only his writings remained in his luggage." (No remuneration accepted)</p>

<p>— Kouzi</p>
<p>I often hear adults and gentlemen lamenting that "talent is hard to find." Is it really that talent is hard to find? Honestly, in a country and society like this, even if there is real talent, it cannot develop. Therefore, on the one hand, geniuses and extraordinary talents die in obscurity, and on the other hand, everyone clamors that talent is hard to find. It really reminds me of a saying by Han Yu, which is, "Is it really that there are no horses? Is it really that people don't know horses!"</p>
<p>Among the students studying in Japan, I feel awe when I hear that they are students of the Imperial University. Because without a higher school background, one cannot enter the Imperial University. The higher school is like the preparatory course for the Imperial University. The Imperial University does not accept students from outside the higher school in the first year. Therefore, when I hear that someone is a student of the Imperial University, their study qualification is at least five or six years or more. Rarity makes things valuable, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>There is an Imperial University student who has been in Japan for more than ten years. He simply can't think about returning to China. Do you know why? Originally, he was on government funding. As long as he is studying, the country will give him money to use. Moreover, he really has the ability. He can make cosmetics. He makes perfumes, snow creams, hair oils, etc. that are even better than those produced by famous Japanese manufacturers. He drew a trademark himself, registered it with the Japanese government, ordered many glass bottles, printed many advertising papers, and promoted his products to pharmacies in Tokyo. He was unexpectedly welcomed by Japanese women, and the supply almost could not meet the demand. He made a lot of money. A Japanese cosmetic manufacturer wanted to recruit him to be a technician, but he smiled and said, "I make this stuff just to subsidize my tuition. Who wants to help the little devils make money?" So he declined!</p>
<p>This friend and his wife are both in Japan. Basically, the country supplies him with expenses. If the government funding is not enough, he can get some benefits from cosmetics. Wearing a square hat, carefree, truly like a fairy, he enjoys staying here and does not want to return home. Someone advised him to return to China. He said: If I go back to China and want to open my own factory, I don't have the capital. If I want to help others, I'm afraid no one will want me. It's better to be happy and carefree here!</p>
<p>He has made up his mind, so when the graduation deadline arrives, he transfers from the Department of Chemistry to the Department of Pharmacy. After four years, he transfers to the Department of Biology. By switching like this, he becomes an old student of the Imperial University. Once, he talked to me at length about essential oils, and I really admired his erudition. I heard that at the Imperial University, not only Japanese students admire him, but even the professors praise him as extraordinary. But we have been back for six or seven years, and this loving couple is still wandering in a foreign country!</p>
<p>A friend like this must be considered a talent, right? However, he is willing to die in a foreign country. Although his views should not be taken as a lesson, the country and society cannot but bear some responsibility for forcing him onto a deviant path, right?</p>

<p>The gold market yesterday saw a sudden surge in selling pressure due to optimism about the outcome of the silver bill after the meeting between the US President and silver advocates, leading to a sharp drop in market prices and widespread panic. The situation was sluggish, but there was also intense struggle, mainly due to the Guangdong trading houses reversing to buy and the central bank buying spot goods. Initially, the overseas silver markets in the UK and the US all fell, but the closing price of forward silver on the metal exchange actually rose by 0.4 to 1.5 percent. Exchange rates remained stable. London raw gold fell by half a penny, US cotton rose by 6 pounds, and US imports rose by half a point. A telegram from the Associated Press stated that after the meeting between the President and silver advocates, the President and leaders of the silver advocates had agreed on a silver bill in this Congress. The White House also formally announced that the President and silver advocates had reached an agreement. According to the President's opinion, silver legislation to improve the monetary system will be in the form of agency rule. Various silver advocates expressed extreme optimism about the outcome of the meeting. As soon as trading opened, prices fell. Subsequently, it was said that the new silver bill would definitely include recognizing silver as the main currency with a silver reserve of 25%. The Ministry of Finance would have the right to purchase silver at up to $1.29 per ounce. The President would have the power to impose penalties, and silver would be nationalized. It was difficult to stay above the $20 level, and prices gradually fell. Later, Reuters also continuously reported similar news, causing extreme panic. The $10 mark was broken, but there were struggles along the way. Later, due to heavy buying by large traders, the situation improved, and the Guangdong trading houses also came to buy strongly and raise prices. However, the market sentiment was ultimately weak, and there were many declines.

<h3 id="e267">Optimism for Silver Legislation; Both British and American Exchange Rates Strengthen <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>

Immediately after the opening, it strengthened due to rumors of optimism surrounding silver legislation. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices were announced, with the British rate rising by 0.5 and the American rate rising by half a yuan, causing the bank's appetite to become congested. However, they slightly picked up when prices were low. The silver price in the Seattle night market fluctuated, calming sentiment. The domestic market was also quiet, with Chinese merchants picking up some holdings. In the afternoon, the Seattle night market silver price rose by 0.375, and there were rumors that the U.S. President was purchasing silver, leading to a loosening trend. Although Chinese merchants were congested, banks took advantage of the low prices to vigorously pick up holdings. The Central Bank opened for spot transactions and improved. Finally, the Bombay rate rose by 7 annas but remained loose. The closing price for recent sales was a British exchange rate of 1 shilling and 3.5 pence, and an American exchange rate of 33 yuan, which was lower than the previous close, calculating a loss of 0.25 for the pound and a gain of 0.5625 for the dollar. Chinese merchants picked up holdings and then became congested again, and even after settlement, they still picked up. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e268">The Call Loan Market is Slack and Weak <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation was particularly slack. Foreign call loans still opened at 6%, and trading was also very sparse. Call loan transactions in the morning settlement were only over 3.5 million, with new transactions over 200,000. In the afternoon, it was over 300,000. Transactions in the Small General Association were over 400,000. Bank receipts and payments were also very idle, so the market price for cashiers' checks was still 2-3%. The small amount of inflow and outflow was a record low for this month. It is estimated that Chinese banks' receipt and payment of bills was 2.3-2.4 million, various cargo, exchange, tax, pledge and miscellaneous receipts and payments were 3.7-3.8 million, and warehouse withdrawals were 200,000. Foreign banks' receipt and payment of bills was over 1.6 million, various cargo, exchange, pledge and miscellaneous receipts and payments were 3.7-3.8 million, telegraphic transfers were over 500,000, and warehouse withdrawals were 300,000.

<h3 id="e269">Auxiliary Coins are Sequentially Declining <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins showed weakness again. The morning market was 833 yuan, and the afternoon market was slightly better by 2 yuan, at 835 yuan. As a result, it was down 1 yuan from the previous day. The trading volume was 8,000 jiao in the morning and 7,500 jiao in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e270">Securities and Bonds Continue in a Dull State <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange continued its old ways and showed no improvement. The dull situation remained unresolved. The situation was still brewing. This repeated spinning has lasted for two weeks. The future changes are frightening to contemplate. Major short sellers still showed no intention of covering, and major longs seemed to show signs of wavering. Although there were rumors, they were still brewing. In the near future, they were unlikely to be very blatant. Therefore, the future of the market price, except for slight fluctuations due to swap relations, the trend should still be in a spinning state. It is necessary to wait until closer to the delivery date when the chips cannot be balanced. Even if the situation does not change, the rise and fall must also be relatively large. Yesterday, the number of swap transactions gradually increased, and swap transactions by longs were more common. Among those who traded more, the sellers were Nos. 38, 43, and 53, and the buyers were Nos. 11 and 21. The rest, such as retail investors' sporadic entries and exits, were limited in number, and trading became even more sluggish. The trend was only slightly better by 0.05 to 0.3 yuan in the morning session, which could be said to be consistent. After that, the second session and the two sessions in the afternoon all saw high and low mutual views, with a total rise and fall of only about 0.05 or 0.1 yuan. The market situation could be described as spinning, stable, or tired and lacking in spirit. The spinning stagnation makes people tired. As a result, the market price generally continued to be better by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan, of which only the 20th volume was slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. The total transaction volume was only 5.7 million yuan. No one consulted about the spot market at all. The results of its highs, lows, rises and falls are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e271">New York Stock Market Trading is Very Quiet <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Sin Fung &amp; Co. reported that yesterday (the 16th), the New York stock market was quiet due to waiting for the legislative authorities' actions on the exchange case. Prices were mixed, and the trading was the quietest this year. Business news was still good, including the announcement of the regular quarterly dividend by AT&amp;T. What was strange was that some people gave it a bad interpretation. They thought that the directors of AT&amp;T did not reduce the dividend because business was not stable enough to withstand the impact. Steel stocks fell due to general forecasts that steel production would be greatly reduced in the third quarter. The market trading was sluggish, resulting in the lowest interest rate ever seen. It was reported that a certain bank lent out a large amount of term loans at an interest rate of only 1% per annum, creating a new record in history. Small exchanges were slightly lower and bonds were trending higher. Grains rebounded strongly due to pessimistic news about production conditions. According to agent reports, (securities) were extremely sluggish, with no trend at all. It is advisable to wait and see for the time being. (Wheat) No rain, the news about production conditions in the northwestern United States and Canada is extremely pessimistic, so prices are rising. It can be expected to be much higher. The production report is bad, there is no rain in Canada and the northwestern United States, and the forecast is for sunny and warm weather, with large sporadic rain. There is no rain in the southwestern United States. (Cotton) The market is idle, and it rose at the end due to the strength of wheat, and the market sentiment is very firm. The public pays little attention to the report of good weather this week. (Rubber) The market is low due to continued unloading by bulls, weakness in London, and no purchases by peers and consumers. The consumption in April was a disappointing 44,947 tons. (Silver) There were large purchases in the near term. Speculators are waiting for the results of today's meeting between Roosevelt and the Senate silver faction and are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The total daily turnover was 720,000 shares.

<p>The yarn market is showing signs of semi-quietness. Due to the firmness of the cotton market and the high price of Japanese yarn, the new selling trend is not very enthusiastic. However, there is still a batch of old goods being sold in the near month, and the situation is slightly soft. The far month is optimistic due to raw material factors, but the turnover of spot yarn is relatively clear.</p>

<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning. Although foreign cotton rose, there were not many buyers in the market. Each month rose slightly by 0.1-0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, some short positions were covered, and each month rose by 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 18,150 bales.

<p>The sales of spot yarn are slightly sluggish. It was found that various groups bought a total of 565 bales for the day.</p>
<p>The market is similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 15 Nanjing 5 Wuhu 30 Peers 5 Yunnan 37</p>
<p>Inland 330 Ningbo 8 Shantou 10 Guangdong 125</p>
<p>The cotton market suddenly rose, because the Indian and American cotton markets were trending higher, and the demand for spot cotton from various factories was smooth on the previous day. Foreign merchants purchased it, and the market situation became tighter. In the afternoon, it was reported that American cotton was expected to continue to rise, and short sellers were again active in covering their positions.</p>

<p>In the standard cotton market, the number of buyers in the morning market was not strong, and the market situation was still half-empty. Each month rose by 0.1-0.2 yuan.

<p>The sales of spot cotton are still good, but as foreign cotton rises, the price quoted by the holders is too high, resulting in difficult transactions. The source is estimated to be 1,000 bales of Tonghua cotton and 50 bales of Yao cotton. The price of spot cotton is as follows:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 42.00 Shanghai factories entered 2,000 bales of spot goods sent to the factory</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 39.05 Yong'an factories entered 300 bales of spot goods sent to the factory</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market first fell due to good weather, and then rebounded due to purchases by New Orleans and short covering. As a result, spot goods rose by 10 points, and futures rose by 6 to 10 points. Liverpool cotton futures rose by 2-3 points, and Egyptian cotton futures rose by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market first fell due to Japanese merchants selling new cotton, Balo Xi, and then rebounded due to good news from Liverpool and purchases by a few speculators. As a result, Pengal rose by 2 rupees, Aumra rose by 4 rupees and 7.5 annas, and Balo Xi rose by 4 rupees and 2.5 annas. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 16th):</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market opened in the morning, and each month showed a stable trend. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago has continued to rise by about 7-8 jiao, Canada rose by 0.3 yuan or so, but after the opening, each month's market, there is no progress, but showing a stable situation. Although foreign wheat quotations are good, the domestic wheat price is difficult to improve, especially this road wheat price is even lower. It is heard that the Tianjin wheat value is currently only about 4.7 yuan, and the weight is more than 160 jin per dan, but 3 yuan per customs tael, and it is an old scale. By comparison, it seems to be cheaper than Shanghai. The suspension of the northern gang is undoubtedly due to this reason. Forced to open in the afternoon, the transaction is even lighter, and the market is almost the same. Factories also rarely bid. Seeing this situation, I am afraid it will have to be held. As a result, this month is slightly better by 0.025 yuan, June and July are unchanged, August is slightly lower by 0.025 yuan, and September and October are better by 0.05 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Wheat Price in the North Road is Cheaper Than This Port; Futures Still Show Stable Signs <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after opening in the morning, each month showed a stable trend. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rose by about 7-8 jiao, Canada rose by about 0.3 yuan, and because the rice price of the gang in the road rose, the mind has turned to active futures standards, and they have been buying for several days, so the market is slightly profitable. Until the afternoon opening, the transaction is still smooth, but the market is weak, because the flour market is not affected, and the industry also rarely enters the intention, so it turns to a fixed trend. According to the current situation, it seems that the hearts of the people in the Jiangnan area are returning to the holding, but the wheat price in the north road has been cheaper than this port, which is enough to worry about the future. As a result, this month is better by 0.01 yuan, August and September are better by 0.02 yuan, and the rest are unchanged. Due to the factory stomach is not moving, the existing wheat has not been started for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Rice Prices Rise in the Wind and Rain <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source of each gang is slightly scarce due to the obstruction of rain and wind. It is estimated that late rice is close to 10, and thick japonica and various colors are close to 10 (a total of more than 5,000 stone). Although the market is limited to both retail and wholesale, the situation can be relatively tight. For example, the Chang bang, Su Tong, and Nan Gang, etc. japonica rice that went to this street, the sellers once raised the price, and the market was better by 0.2 yuan. The Du Yang sharp followed up by more than 0.1 chi. The price of Yin Yuan varies, but Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, etc. late rice are very few due to the customer bang's package stomach movement. Only the North Ocean bang enters the Lintang goods in one ship, about 100 bags. Although the rest is adopted by the store stomach, the general trend is inevitably inferior, and the market price is difficult to improve, only slightly rising by a few points to 0.1 yuan or so.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, each gang arrived in 27-8 ships, and there were more than 100 numbers in the river. Although the retail stomach of various colors in the market is clear, it rained heavily in the morning, and did not stop until noon. The store's listing is sparse, and the stomach is usually gone. The market is white japonica. The morning market is fixed, and the high-quality goods in the afternoon market are stable. Medium and second-class tight corners, Xu Bianyuan, Yangjian, Dujian, Dujian, and Kujian are priced early rice and thin rice are scarce, and Yin Yuan lacks arrival. The prices have not changed much.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Foreign Rice and Indica Rice Continue to Be Prosperous; the City Continues to Open 26,000 Bags <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice and indica market was very prosperous. A large number of shipments from the Yangtze River and Jiangbei arrived, and the market was very active. The city sold more than 11,000 bags of rough and refined rice and indica rice from various roads, and 15,000 bags of small milled foreign rice were sold. The indica rice was active, and the hearts of the people continued to rise. Yesterday, the Indica rice was mostly eaten by the inland and Zhejiang gangs, and the Fujian Province's buying stomach continued to be not light. This street revived to inquire. Therefore, at the time of the head step, the market was active again. The small milled rice that opened yesterday was all bought by the inland and Zhejiang gangs. The inland bang also paid attention to rough indica and machine Jing. This street and Fujian Province both had active intentions for machine rough buying. Although the market is prosperous, the situation is quite different. There are still many foreign rice stocks, and it has risen by 1.2-1.3 yuan. The market turned fixed yesterday. 1,000 bags of rough rice arrived yesterday, and there are still many steps later, so it saw a small rebound. The shipment of late and early rice from Jiangxi has been discontinued, and the arrival of guest yuan stocks is small. It is also for the sake of this trial to greed, and the prices have risen by 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Each file of machine Indica has a balanced arrival and disappearance, and it is slightly prosperous.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yellow bean market was due to the shutdown of the bean cake's going to Shantou. "The import of each piece of tax is 0.3 yuan, and it is now being requested to be exempted." The cake price turned down by more than 0.02 yuan. The factory's bean stomach is not moving, and other gangs are also watching more. The overall market only has sporadic moves. It is estimated that Dalian beans opened in 3 cars, which were bought by the garden squares in this street. The inland bought 300 bags of Za beans in Hankou, and the Wenzhou gang bought 100 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow. This street bought more than 60 bags of Pinghu Du beans. The market price is still stable. The Tianjin-Pukou Road each bean cargo household shouted a small 0.04-0.05 yuan, and still lacks people to ask about. The red grain market rose all the way, and its source is still not much, about 5-6 cars, and there are also 3-4 cars going, so the market is tight. Yesterday, the inland distillery bought 2 cars of high red shell, the price was 2.5 yuan, and 1 car of No. 1 and No. 2 red shells, the price was 2.49 yuan.</p>

<p>Improved Varieties Can Be Expected to Have a Good Harvest</p>
<p>Late Local Silkworms Are Better</p>
<p>Hushu Improved varieties of silkworm eggs in Hushu, Hangzhou, are developing smoothly. The early gang will come out of the fire, and the late gang is also prosperous with leaves. In an instant, they can be placed on the shelves to make cocoons, and a good harvest can be expected. However, there are limited remaining eggs of local varieties left in the area, and the late gang is better.</p>
<p>Xiashi The improved varieties hatched by farmers in the improved silkworm area are entering the big sleep. When the weather turns sunny, the silkworm eggs develop quickly. Some of the early gangs have enough leaves to be placed on the shelves, and the late silkworms only have prosperous leaves. If the weather does not change in the past few days, the silkworm harvest can be expected to be abundant. As for the local silkworms raised in various villages, many have been discarded in the third sleep.</p>
<p>Anji Farmers in the four villages who hatch improved varieties account for 60%. Local varieties are mostly from Zhuji and Yuhang. Due to bad weather, there has been quite a lot of damage in the second sleep. The improved variety of silkworms has been turned from danger to safety by the instructors who have adjusted the temperature and humidity. Now that the weather is warm and the ants have passed well, the early gang has opened the leaves in the third sleep, and the current situation is quite good.</p>
<p>Yangzhong The local silkworms raised by farmers in various cities and villages have been greatly affected by the adverse weather conditions in the second sleep, and many have died stiffly. The development of improved varieties is delayed. After the new mulberry is chopped and the silkworms are fed, the loss is still small. Fortunately, the weather has turned sunny and warm, and the development has turned around. The early gang has been sleeping for three days, and the leaf eating is gradually prosperous. The local silkworms have also passed well.</p>
<p>Japan Japan's silkworm season is earlier than that of our country. Now Wei Nong's automatic limit on the production of spring cocoons, the number of ants raised is reduced, and the weather is bad. Although silkworm farmers pay attention to scientific breeding, the weather is unfavorable and slightly affected. The spring cocoons have already seen the new, and it is expected that the national cocoon production will be reduced by 25% compared with last year, and the cocoon quality is still excellent.</p>

<p>The New York silk weaving factory has canceled the saying that it will stop work for a week because the sales of silk are gradually turning around. Raw silk factories are gradually rising, and importers have telegraphed to various foreign firms in this port to inquire about market prices. The European firms have also taken advantage of the cheap prices to throw and buy new futures silk, so the white factory warp and weft new futures goods for July and August have been thrown open. It is estimated that Dachang and others have entered 130 bales of upper middle body, and the price is still firm.</p>

<p>New Suian Zhenmei green tea from the road has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Xie Lihua Tea and other firms opened the first dish at 120-122 yuan, which is about 4-5 yuan lower than last year. However, since this market has been launched, the demand from various firms has been quite strong. It is expected that the later new goods will not be very sluggish. The market for local Zhuang Zhenmei green tea has slightly declined, but the going is not very lonely. Yesterday, the market Xiehe, Jinlong, Tianyu and other firms have all entered. Wenzhou black tea continues to sell well, and the price is firm. Only the Wenzhou Zhenmei item, the going is slightly sluggish.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight recovery in customs gold, with a softening trend. The guild's listed price for Grade 14 coarse granulated white sugar was $20.90, down 8 cents, with few transactions. Re-export goods were traded at $6.77, down 3 cents. No transactions were made for No. 89 Dutch red sugar or Taikoo Sugar's B mark. According to a telegram from Shantou, the supply of domestic Chaozhou Qing sugar remained scarce, with Tianjin merchants purchasing it, causing the market price to gradually rise. The price of Jieyang Qing sugar soared by 67 cents, and Longgang Qing sugar rose by 30 cents. Consequently, the listed price for Jieqing is now $12.50, and Longgang Qing is $11.56. The market may continue to tighten, but sales have not increased significantly, and the price rise is slow. Yesterday, only over 200 bags of Longgang Qing sugar were released, priced at $11, only 10 cents higher than the previous listed price. This has created a disparity compared to the local price, with a difference of as much as half a dollar.</p>

Sales were mostly in small quantities. Summer fabrics such as Summer French Velvet, Rose Velvet, Fanlili, Pilice white twill, white tribute woolen, feather yarn woolen, yellow serge, and rubberized cloth were actively traded and sold well. However, prices remained reasonable because buyers were cautious, and the market was flooded with inventory. Sellers sought to clear their stock rather than raise prices to avoid losses from unsold inventory. Yesterday's transaction price for Summer French Velvet was $3.75, Sanai Summer French Velvet at $3.05, Grade 1 Rose Velvet at $4.09, Grade 2 at $4.05, the old brand Three Deer Head good quality white yarn serge was at a net price of 60 cents, and white double yarn rubberized cloth was at 62.5 cents.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Reading a Few Books <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Dangshi</p>
<p>It has long been argued that reading books to death turns one into a bookworm, or even a walking library. As time marches on, the trend against reading has become even more thorough, with some people opposing reading any kind of book. Their basis is Schopenhauer's old saying that reading other people's works is like letting the author ride a horse in your own brain.</p>
<p>This is certainly a wake-up call for those who read books to death, but for geniuses who would rather explore, dance, or be simply agitated, it is a golden saying worth introducing. However, it must be understood that the brain of the genius who clings to this saying is being ridden by Schopenhauer's horse, trampled into a mess.</p>
<p>Now, critics are complaining because there are no better works; creators are also complaining because there is no correct criticism. Zhang San says that Li Si's work is symbolism, so Li Si also believes that it is symbolism, and the reader naturally also believes that it is symbolism. However, what is symbolism? It has never been clarified, so we can only use Li Si's works as evidence. Therefore, what is called symbolism in China is different from what is called Symbolism in other countries, although the former is actually the translation of the latter. However, having heard that Maeterlinck is a symbolic writer, Li Si becomes the Chinese Maeterlinck. In addition, there are many Chinese France, Chinese Babbitt, Chinese Gaultier, Chinese Gorky... However, the translated works of the real France are very few in China. Is it perhaps because there are already "domestic products"?</p>
<p>In the Chinese literary world, the lives of several domestic writers are too long; and the foreign writers are too short. Their names have just become familiar, it is said that they have already passed. Ibsen is expected to have a complete collection, but the third volume is still unseen; Chekhov and Maupassant's selected works also seem to have ended in failure. But in Japan, which we deeply hate, "Don Quixote" and "One Thousand and One Nights" have complete translations: Shakespeare, Goethe, etc. have complete collections: Tolstoy has three kinds, Dostoevsky has two kinds.</p>
<p>Reading books to death is harmful to oneself and harms others as soon as one opens one's mouth; but not reading books is not necessarily good either. At least, for example, if you want to criticize Tolstoy, you must read a few of his works. Of course, now is a time of national crisis, and there is no time to translate these books or read these books, but what I am proposing is to those great men who are only agitated and complaining, not to those heroes who are going to disaster or "sleeping on firewood and tasting gall." Because some people, even if they don't read books, only play and don't go to disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e289">"Spring Floating Garden Diary" <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>The "Spring Floating Garden Diary", which describes scenery and the life of a pastoral poet, has some excellent passages. The writing is concise and orderly, seemingly striving to emulate Fang Weng. Several examples are worth mentioning:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>"Ninth day, clear. Transplanted several green plum trees in front of the study, where one can lie and smell them." (2)</p>
<p>"Nineteenth day, clear. Magnolias bloom for the first time, admiring them under the moon, their purity and coldness are indescribable."</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>"Fifteenth day. Watched the moon in the lake with guests. After several rounds of wine, there was a slight rain, which gradually became heavier. We ascended the lake pavilion to avoid it. Soon, the wind rose and the water surged. The guests were intolerably cold and all huddled together under blankets. The faint moon, heavy mist, and water trees were shrouded in darkness, creating a strangely beautiful scene. The guests stayed overnight at the Jue Tan Forest, and I stayed at the Bamboo Pavilion, unable to return home." (Xinwei, Spring Floating Garden Occasional Records).</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>"Fourth day. Western crabapples are in full bloom, and peaches and plums are also budding. A few daffodils are in bloom, charming and pitiful. In the evening, I visited the Prajna Temple to explore chrysanthemums. The 'Against Frost Yellow' variety is the best, comparable to Ji Gong's 'Golden Finch Tongue'." (Xiao Zhai Diary)</p>
<p>Shi Wei advocated in his writing that "the most difficult thing for a writer is to achieve the realm of plainness. Su Gong said: 'Gradually getting old and experienced, one can create plainness, and only then can one glimpse this.'" (Daily Records). He also said: "Recently, my writing has been simple but lawful." (Spring Floating Garden Occasional Records). These are reflected in his diary, forming a style of plainness and conciseness, with natural and genuine characteristics, worthy of "literary appreciation." The part about social life is very, very little in Shi Wei's diary; like:</p>
<p>"Fourth day. Many people reported early drought. The people's livelihood is deteriorating. Even with a good year, it is still difficult to survive, let alone compounded by war? However, people coming from the north say that after the war, corpses are piled up like mountains, and fires are extinguished. Although there is no year, it is still a happy country." (Occasional Records)</p>
<p>This kind of record is already quite rare. In addition to daily mountain living, flower cultivation, and travel, it also involves books and articles, such as:</p>
<p>"Twelfth day. 'Lying Tour Records' are so rough, I think they were also recorded as ideas arrived, not a complete book. Zhou Gongjin's 'Cheng Huai Records' are also stingy and lack depth. In the evening, after bathing, jasmine flowers bloomed." (Occasional Records).</p>
<p>In addition, there are two or three items on satirical material. On the whole, although Shi Wei's diary strives to emulate Fang Weng, it cannot be compared to the "Entry into Shu Records" in terms of its rich and radiant language and the broadness of the author's scholarship. Moreover, the "Entry into Shu Records" has a value far exceeding that of the "Spring Floating Garden Diary" in cultural history.</p>
<p>At first, I read the "Complete Works of Spring Floating Garden" with the same hope as for the "Jia Xing" and "Flower Viewing" records, wanting to grasp the psychological life of this Ming dynasty remnant. However, I was disappointed. In the diary, except for a preface to "Daily Records of Shen Mu'an", there is nothing; in the collection of poems, there are only a few sentences in "Ascending the Pavilion on the Ninth Day": "Sorrowfully weeping for the old people, the festivals are tired of pure wine;" and the article "Stele Inscription of Longping Mountain Temple". The inscription says:</p>
<p>"The four directions are disturbed by clouds, and there is no complete nest for the clouds: the family and country are lost, and the old country folks are worried. Although the flowing spring is unharmed, and my yang is as before, there is sorrow in the wind and millet, and grief on the road. Even if I want to be like Mr. Zi Gao and embrace this beautiful and refined intention, and write about the desolation of the mountains and rivers, how can it be possible?"</p>
<p>Only these few sentences profoundly express his own depression. In addition to his small essays and diaries, according to the "Preface to Current Essays", there is also a kind of "Drunken Fool's Small Essays", which is a pity that I have not seen. The diary, in the complete collection, includes a total of</p>
<p>(1) "Spring Floating Garden Occasional Records" (Xinwei and Gengwu)</p>
<p>(2) "Bian Tour Records" (Xinwei)</p>
<p>(3) "Xiao Zhai Diary" (namely "Yue Sheng Pavilion Diary"),</p>
<p>(4) "South Return Daily Records" (Dingmao)</p>
<p>(5) "Daily Records of Shen Mu'an" (Guiyou)</p>
<p>A total of five kinds and six volumes, collection of "Xiao Shi Run Yu Xuan". (End)</p>

<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>March 6, rainy day. When I got up, the misty rain had covered the fields and barren mountains outside the window with a white haze, leaving only some blurred black outlines. The stationmaster, telegrapher, and office staff had all gone back to their rooms to sleep. Even the switchmen had gone to town: leaving the flag waving lonely in the rain. The trains coming and going here are all at night. As soon as the rooster crows, these many trains, like ghosts, all disappear without a trace. The station is like the hall of a desolate temple, with the scattered footprints of the previous night still on the ground. There is not a single person, should be there are no people nearby? Especially on this kind of rainy day, how desolate! Ah! How desolate it is!</p>
<p>Because it was too lonely to stay at the station alone, I found a travel guide for the Hunan-Hubei Railway to see if there were any famous historical sites nearby. The book said there were the tomb of Lao Laizi and Zifu Temple. Zifu Temple was built by imperial decree in the Tang Dynasty and has been burned and rebuilt many times, so it shouldn't be very interesting. But Lao Laizi's tomb is seventeen or eight miles away from the station. In this desolate mountain village, in this rainy weather, on this muddy road, without knowing the way, without a guide... even if you ask the villagers along the way, they may not all know the sleeping place of the "old child"? Then, should I visit the nearby Zifu Temple? This is how it was decided.</p>
<p>Without an umbrella, I walked two or three miles in the drizzle with my bald head, and Zifu Temple arrived. If it weren't for the three words "Zifu Temple" clearly written on the gatehouse, I would have passed by without knowing it. It is such a small and freshly painted white temple!</p>
<p>This temple is a two-entrance house, with three rooms in each, separated by a patio. Because the back entrance was the auspicious day for the consecration of some Bodhisattva, incense and people filled the room, so I didn't go in, just walked around in the outer entrance. The western room in the outer entrance is a place for storing sundries, full of water trucks and the like, like the works of some cubist painter, it only makes people feel depressed; in the middle is a female Bodhisattva, with a plaque "In the Purple Bamboo Forest", probably Guanyin Bodhisattva; the room on the left is a branch of the town's police station, with a portrait of the Premier hanging in the hall, and a red piece of paper with "Take Office Auspicious" written on it below. In front of the Premier's portrait are incense burners and candle holders. This newly appointed chief should be a fat, squint-eyed, and often laughing funny character? Otherwise, he is just a complete fool.</p>
<p>Just like that, poking my head around, searching everywhere like I had lost my wallet, I finally found some things that could be considered more ancient. It was a stele from the Jiaqing era, with five poems inscribed on it. The first four poems were inscribed by famous people from the Tang and Song dynasties who visited the temple. The fifth poem was the great work of the county magistrate who donated the stele. Chinese literati are the most opportunistic people in the world, and they all care very much about being remembered for generations. This county magistrate, if he lived in present-day China, would probably have published many collections long ago, and would be a powerful figure in the literary world, right?</p>
<p>I took out my notebook and stood in front of the stele to copy the first four poems (with childish mischief, deliberately throwing away the fifth poem). While I was looking and copying, many villagers surrounded me. One villager said loudly behind me:</p>
<p>"The money donated by XXX is all from widows. That widow had an affair with him, and she is using this stinky money to do good deeds. She can't hide it from the Bodhisattva!..."</p>
<p>At first, I was quite strange about the abruptness of these words. Later, I saw a stele in front of me with the names of pious men and women inscribed on it. This remark was probably referring to this. Hastily, I hastily copied the four poems, nodded and smiled at the people surrounding me, and mysteriously broke through the encirclement.</p>
<p>"Chinese people all love 'fame'! The rich, the poor, the educated, the illiterate, everyone wants 'fame', wants permanent 'fame', but they all want to get this permanent good reputation without spending any effort! Chinese people really like to do this kind of business the most!..." Walking and thinking like this, slipping step by step, I returned to the station in a short while.</p>
<p>Brushing off my wet coat, I saw that it was almost twelve o'clock, but the stationmasters had not gotten up yet, so I copied the diary that I hadn't organized for several days.</p>
<p>This small station is really too desolate! It reminds me of a short story by Gorky, "For the Sake of Too Much Monotony." When I came here last night, it was already late at night, and I was sleepy, so I didn't talk to the stationmaster, and I didn't even see his face. Could he be like the protagonist in Gorky's short story?</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking this, the stationmaster came out from behind. It was really "speak of Cao Cao and Cao Cao arrives"! I wanted to laugh out loud, but I managed to hold it back. He said a few words of apology, and then invited me in for a meal.</p>
<p>Because it was the first meal in the morning, and because the stationmaster was also from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, he also prepared porridge. After wandering outside for three or four years, porridge had been temporarily forgotten by me like my hometown. This time, seeing the thick white porridge, I suddenly remembered all the loveliness of my hometown. Although the weather was not cold, I held the bowl and didn't start eating. This breakfast was really the most comfortable meal I had.</p>
<p>Seeing the dishes on the table, they were all very exquisite and rich, so I asked uneasily where all these things came from. He said that he had these many dishes all year round, and that he was a gourmand because the chicken, fish, and meat here were cheaper than elsewhere; there was no place for entertainment here, and he didn't have any habits such as cards and wine, and because of his job, he couldn't easily leave for a day. He was always stationed at this small station, so he vented his loneliness and boredom on the dishes he ate.</p>
<p>After listening to his eating experience, I thought of the protagonist in Gorky's short story again. Their loneliness is the same.</p>
<p>The rain outside the window is always hanging like an annoying fog. Ah, really, this spring rain, I don't know when it will stop.</p>

<p>— Sha Ming</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>Is it a dream?</p>
<p>When a misty gust of wind blew on my chest, when the golden sea water reflected in my eyes; the dreamlike illusion vanished unexpectedly. Looking into the distance at the group of shell gatherers,</p>
<p>Golden shells, peach-colored shells:</p>
<p>They are the remnants left behind by life!</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>The waves are surging and crashing against the steep rocks!</p>
<p>Is it the last struggle of the power of life?</p>
<p>Golden shells, peach-colored shells,</p>
<p>When they flaunt in front of me;</p>
<p>The hope stirred up by emotions,</p>
<p>Suddenly plunged into the longing of misery.</p>
<h3 id="e292">Eugenie (3) <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>"What method?" Xuan asked.</p>
<p>"Dear, because you refuse to move elsewhere, I have to move," Eugenie said resolutely and gently.</p>
<p>"Then why bother!" Xuan did not expect the girl to be so determined and immediately gave in. "I'll move then. If you move, not to mention anything else, this piano is heavy enough. If you unfortunately move in with some bad teenagers, I'll be even more worried."</p>
<p>"You're right. I knew you loved me, and you would definitely believe me," Eugenie smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>"When do you want me to move?"</p>
<p>Sure enough, Xuan gave up his room and moved to the Villa Yaju in the 14th arrondissement. The people in the apartment thought that Eugenie and he had broken up! After that, they lived as Eugenie had stipulated. Every Saturday night, Eugenie and Xuan enjoyed themselves thoroughly. Eugenie was very diligent and passed all the oral and written exams in June. She and Xuan toured Paris and the suburbs of Paris for two weeks and went home for the summer vacation.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, Eugenie's father came to Paris to attend an international academic conference. Because of Eugenie's introduction, he came to visit Xuan. He was a typical father who always wore a morning suit, and Xuan liked him very much. He invited him to taste Chinese food several times and couldn't help but reveal his admiration for Eugenie. Eugenie's father nodded and smiled, knowing the young man's meaning.</p>
<p>When the second school year began, Eugenie returned to Paris. Xuan had already rented half a floor in the suburbs, with two rooms facing a small garden. He welcomed Eugenie to live there. Although he still kept his room in Villa Yaju, he only went there occasionally when he had appointments with other male and female friends. In fact, he was always in the suburbs, accompanying Eugenie. After a long separation, their love became even stronger. Eugenie's ability to read French had increased, and she didn't go to class in the city much, but concentrated on preparing for the exam. They called themselves an engaged couple, and the landlady's family was very envious. The old woman showed her joy for the young couple with extremely attentive hospitality. After the anniversary of Xuan and Eugenie's engagement passed, they both wrote to their families at the same time, officially announcing this love and praying for the approval of both families.</p>
<p>This did not cause much surprise in Eugenie's family, because after her father returned home, Xuan had become the subject of family conversation several times. When Eugenie's letter arrived home, her father and mother's opinions immediately diverged. Her father liked this oriental youth very much; her mother was very opposed. In that rather conservative country, Eugenie's own decision on her husband was considered an encroachment on maternal authority; and Eugenie's choice fell on a foreign youth whom her mother had never met. The fact that it took at least a month to sail from Europe to Shanghai further strengthened her mother's determination to oppose it to the end. Then, the matter was passed from neighbors to the ears of the pastor. The pastor gave Eugenie's parents a special warning: the daughters of the Greek Orthodox Church cannot marry non-believers. Thus, even Eugenie's father did not dare to maintain his support. They had decided to immediately call Eugenie back home, but because of Eugenie's gentle explanation, they still allowed her to stay in Paris to study.</p>
<p>As for Xuan's family, things were even more unfavorable. Xuan's father had always disliked Xuan, especially his marriage problems, which had caused the old man much unhappiness. Xuan had been engaged to a young girl from the Yang family. When Xuan was twenty years old, he corresponded directly with Miss Yang without going through the family and agreed to dissolve the engagement. When the two families ratified the dissolution of the engagement, they also had to settle the economic relations arising from the family relationship. Thus, Xuan's marriage problem had always been a source of annoyance for his father! When he went abroad, his mother warned him against getting close to Western girls. Therefore, the day after his letter stating his love for Eugenie arrived home, his father sent a telegram forbidding him from associating with Eugenie, let alone getting engaged. His mother wrote a letter of calm persuasion, arguing from both emotional and factual standpoints; and said that the family could help him marry a cousin who he had once proposed to but been rejected.</p>

<h3 id="e293">From Japanese Science Education to Chinese Children's Science <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Lücong</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I saw the section on Mr. Zhou Houxu's impression of Japanese education in the education news column of this newspaper, and I couldn't help but feel deeply ashamed of ourselves for only shouting slogans such as "Down with Japanese imperialism" and "Take back lost territories" without actually doing anything. Can Japanese imperialism be overthrown by mouth? Even if all 450 million Chinese people shouted together, Japanese imperialism would never fall down because of our shouting. They would only laugh at us and get cold teeth.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou said that we Chinese only talk but don't act, while the Japanese act but don't talk. Of course, the "talk" refers to empty talk. This is an unexaggerated fact. When a Chinese person is slapped in the face, he can't help but open his teeth and scold: the more painful the scolding, the better. It seems that this is already revenge. But they don't know that the one being scolded has already silently prepared to slap the second time, or even prepared to really "do you to death."</p>
<p>This is a fatal wound of the Chinese nation, and it is also a fundamental reason why China is weak and Japan is strong!</p>
<p>Japan has only had a history of fifty or sixty years since the Meiji Restoration, but it has been able to jump from an unnoticed island country to the most noticed and strongest country in the world. It cannot be said that it is not due to their hardworking spirit, doing what they say, and being able to catch up with other people's strengths in practice. It has been twenty or thirty years since the Chinese Revolution, and the reason why it is getting worse and worse is definitely not the weakness of the Chinese people's ability, but the "only talking but not doing."</p>
<p>For example, science. Everyone says that it is the only weapon of national defense in modern countries, and it is an indispensable tool for human life in the future. To relieve national disasters and save China, we can only promote science and popularize science, and the voice of science can be said to be very loud. But in reality, the Chinese scientific community is desolate and makes people shudder. In particular, children's science is even more out of the question. But in Japan, "from elementary school to university, they all pay consistent attention to physics and chemistry." Their teachers guide students to study science with patience and perseverance. Their students are "using their hands and eyes to observe, experiment, collect, and solve problems themselves." They use the laboratory as a classroom, teaching, learning, and doing at the same time. Therefore, it is not without reason that Japan can carry out its barbarous behavior. Moreover, if you go to their bookstores, you will see no less than a dozen scientific magazines specifically for children, not to mention ordinary ones. Although my country has published one or two relatively remarkable scientific magazines in recent years, there is still no trace of any specifically for children.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism cannot be overthrown by mouth, and national disasters cannot be relieved by mouth. If we really want to overthrow Japanese imperialism and truly save the country from danger, we still have to work hard in practice. History tells us that being rash and shouting slogans is of no avail. Although Japanese imperialism is our eternal enemy, their admirable hardworking spirit of doing what they say is still worthy of our imitation!</p>
<h3 id="e294">On the Cause of Ms. Gong Yinxia's Death (Part 1) <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ci</p>
<p>Ms. Gong Yinxia committed suicide with her children. The reverberation this news must cause in anyone's mind is surely, "excessively tragic!" But how did this excessively tragic event occur? For a person to put themselves in a position of death, and to put the beloved children left behind by her deceased lover to death, creating this rare tragedy, shows that the pain and oppression she suffered in 'life' must have been extremely deep and heavy.</p>
<p>But how did this deep pain and heavy oppression come about? As Mr. Yuan, the author of the Shen Bao commentary on the ninth, said, "It was neither emotional impulse nor economic hardship, but the oppression of the living environment." On the one hand, Ms. Gong was attached to the nest that she had created and managed together with her deceased lover, considering it a place of spiritual sustenance; on the other hand, she was unwilling to be constrained and tormented by the life of a large family. The former, Ms. Gong herself stated explicitly (see her suicide note, which is a possible inner need for a knowledgeable person with a rich emotional life), the latter, we can understand clearly just by looking at Mr. Qin Pingfu's letter, with phrases like "Aunt is merely suspicious and trivial... all the sisters are married off... tactful accommodation... being strict with oneself and lenient with others... magnanimous..." It tells us that the inevitable contradictions and conflicts in every large family were no exception in that family. Ms. Gong felt the pain of not wanting to leave her home in Shanghai and not wanting to be merged into the home in Wuxi, so on April 11th, after receiving a letter from her father-in-law, after April 15th (seven weeks after February 25th), she even went to Mr. Yuan to discuss her children's schooling and her own career issues. This should be an attempt to dissuade the proposal to return to Wuxi, in order to eliminate the pain she would suffer, which is also a side proof of the more than ten times she wanted to commit suicide but stopped. But in the end, she was oppressed by irresistible pressure, which made her unable to bear the accusations of "division", "harming feelings", "adding to the burden", not being "magnanimous", etc. She was saddened by the destruction of her independent life, and even her independent personality was doubted, so in the end, she had no choice but to escape all suffering by suicide.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasoning, it can be said that Ms. Gong's death was also after a struggle, and she inevitably died because she could not have both!</p>
<p>However, this is entirely an analysis of her behavior from Ms. Gong's own thoughts. If we judge her by the "rational standard of living," then her behavior is completely wrong. Although she yearned for a rational life, her thinking was not enough to guide her on how to protect her demands: for example, a woman with bound feet is not fundamentally unable to wade through water and climb mountains, but the long strips of cloth destroy her ability. If Ms. Gong had natural feet, if she had not been bound by feudal ideas and had been fully nurtured in the new world and accepted new ideas, then the oppression she suffered would not have become oppression at all. We analyze the reasons why the Qin family insisted on Ms. Gong returning to Wuxi: on the one hand, they wanted to combine the property to generate profits and accumulate wealth (silently reverse the fortune; therefore, they must "return to Wuxi to save expenses, and save a penny today to reduce the burden on the eldest grandson in the future"); on the other hand, they may have thought that a middle-aged widow living in a prosperous city was not proper. Therefore, he, as the head of the family, with the authority to manage the property of the widow and interfere with the actions of the widow, insisted that his daughter-in-law return home, and even found a reason of "the deceased's soul has a command" to be the rear guard. These great principles that were considered sacred and inviolable in feudal society must be known to have been denied and overthrown today. If Ms. Gong was a person who had accepted new ideas and had a clear understanding of the current society, recognizing that people in the current society, especially women in the current society, should only follow reason in everything, not compromise, and not live in ease. If it is contrary to the truth, then fight with the spirit of revolution. Then, she would not consider destroying the economic system of the large family as a fault, or helping the economic development of the large family as her duty, or accumulating more inheritance for her descendants as a blessing for her descendants, or disobeying the orders of her in-laws as a damage to virtue; nor would she believe that her deceased husband could still issue orders in the "underworld". What she should consider her only duty is to maintain personal independence, seek the development of personal ability, and do her best to ensure that her children receive a good education, so that they become useful talents for society. If she had this understanding, and acted according to her inner demands, then would she still need to be distressed and hesitant, unable to cope, and eventually commit suicide? (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e295">Impressions of the City God Temple <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Xin</p>
<p>Upon entering the City God Temple, one vaguely feels that in Shanghai, which is full of Western influence, the City God Temple is a place where one can better savor the unique style of China. Although everything is in a slump now, the City God Temple is still as lively as ever, and there is no sign of decline. Every day, it is crowded with people, continuously entering and exiting to visit and admire. When you first enter, you may feel that there is nothing spectacular, but if you look carefully, there are some things that are not entirely ordinary. It seems that within the plain and vulgar scenery, there is an infinite hidden charm. Some of the elegant styles of antiques make people feel the civilized ancient country and think of today's sick man of Asia, and have endless feelings of melancholy!</p>
<p>After leaving the City God Temple, the impressions that remain in my mind, apart from this bit of desolate feeling, are the gods and women there that I find interesting. The countless Buddhas there are indeed the main scenery! The air of incense is even thicker. Passing by, my eyes almost teared up from the smoke. Speaking of liveliness, this is the most prominent place. The women who worship gods are so numerous that it makes people laugh. Each of them puts on a very serious look, solemnly holding the burning incense in their hands, right in front of their chest. They also have a bag hanging on their bodies, like the ones monks and nuns use for begging for alms, presumably meaning that you must hang it on your body to worship the gods. From the left side to the right side, from the front to the back, passing by each other, all are the same kind of women. Silently muttering in their mouths; after inserting the incense and kneeling down to kowtow, they put their hands together and bow to each of the Buddhas, big and small. Sometimes when you pass by the Buddhas, you are lucky enough to enjoy a few bows as well. They worship all kinds of different</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Buddhas, all reciting words, asking for wishes. It seems to have become a very tasteless daily routine, giving a somewhat inexplicable feeling. After feeling amused for a while, I think about why it is completely women who worship gods, and there are almost no men. On the one hand, I feel that the fate of the gods is still prosperous, with so many people sincerely taking the trouble to worship them, still representing the strong existence of feudal meaning; but on the other hand, I also seem to feel that only women worship gods so enthusiastically, while men do not worship gods, then it can show that gods are gradually declining, superstition is gradually being eliminated, and men are more active in society, so they are mostly swept away by the realities of life and worship gods less, with only women remaining immersed in dreams in the ghost stories of gods, which is somewhat gratifying. However, the problem is not so simple, how will the fate of the gods decline now! I heard that in my hometown, adults are chanting about returning to the past. From returning to the past to worshiping gods and Buddhas, it seems that in the absence of other options, returning to the past and welcoming gods can temporarily become a countermeasure, serving as a way to save the times. I cannot help but think again about the prosperity of the gods in the City God Temple, which is a relatively unique style of sentiment in today's world.</p>
<h3 id="e296">A Fu <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>A Fu's wife has been dead for a whole month. During this month, his life has been extremely difficult and painful. Not only does he have to cook and wash his own clothes after getting off work, but he also has to decoct medicine and wash diapers for his four-year-old child, who has been sick for two weeks. Although he has only lived this kind of life for a short month, he is indeed tired enough. In the middle of the night, when he is awakened from his drowsy sleep by his child's crying, he always sighs sadly, calling out to his wife, and complaining about his hard life.</p>
<p>In the past two days, his child's illness has become even more severe. He cries and screams all day long, and his small body is almost burning dry. His thin, dark face is covered with a layer of ochre, and his eyes seem to have lost their luster. A Fu has taken leave from work to take care of his poor child at home. He exchanged a pair of gold-plated rings left behind by his wife for one yuan and two jiao, and took his child to see the doctor several times, but the child is still sick. He is so anxious that he has no ideas. He invited Li Mama, who lives next door, to come over and asked her what he should do. Li Mama said that if the fever does not go down all day like this, it must not be effective to take medicine. It is probably because the time is bad and he has encountered some ghosts and gods. So she told him not to take his child to see the doctor anymore, because it would be a waste of time. He should go to Qingliang Temple to ask the gods, ask for a fairy prescription to try, and buy more tin foil money and paper at night. Ask Granny Wang to restrain the gods and drive away the ghosts. Then, he will definitely get better tomorrow. A Fu accepted Li Mama's advice with tears in his eyes and a heart full of suffering. He entrusted his crying child lying on the bed to Li Mama, and took a quilt from the bed that was covered with many urine stains and had holes revealing the dark wadding, and went out.</p>
<p>Three hours later, A Fu ran home panting with sweat all over his head. The tattered and dark quilt had been exchanged for four mao of small coins. Together with the four mao he had in his pocket, he made eight mao, bought a few pieces of tin foil, a bundle of paper money, and also brought four pieces of soy sauce meat and a packet of peanuts, which were prepared for Granny Wang to drink while performing a ritual to drive away ghosts for his child tonight. He also took out the fairy prescription from his arms. The so-called fairy prescription was a piece of yellow paper, on which it was written crookedly to decoct water with yellow soil from the stove and licorice to give to the child. On the day after taking the fairy prescription and Granny Wang performing a ritual to drive away ghosts, their child was indeed much quieter. Not only did he not cry and scream, but he also did not ask for food or drink. He was just drowsy and immersed in sleep. It took a lot of effort and methods to wake him up. Touching his small forehead, it was still hot and burning on the palm of his hand. Therefore, A Fu felt that this situation was too quiet, and felt an unnamed anxiety and fear in his heart. He went to ask his high neighbor Li Mama for advice again with a bag of tears in his eyes. Li Mama came to see him again, still acting old-fashioned, bulging her two dry lips, and said reasonably: "Brother A Fu, it doesn't matter, don't worry. The fairy prescription will only take effect after a day and a night. If the child wants to sleep, let him sleep. Don't yell at him. It's pitiful. Didn't you say that he has been noisy all night until dawn for seven or eight days? He is so young, he should be tired. Let him be quiet. I tell you, doctors are the most unreliable. I have lived this long and have never seen a doctor. Every time my back aches, I just ask for a fairy prescription and eat it, and it will be fine. Fairy prescriptions are really effective." Li Mama said confidently while covering the child with a blanket.</p>
<p>On that very night, from two o'clock, the child lying on the bed changed. At first, he was just humming with his teeth clenched, then slowly clenched his fists, rolled his eyes, rolled around on the bed, and shouted with a straight voice in his throat. A Fu had no other way, just calling out "My good child!" helplessly, and teardrops dripped on his hot little body.</p>
<p>By the time it was almost dawn, the child's throat was stuck with phlegm, gurgling and speeding up his breathing. After another half an hour, the child stopped breathing. A Fu knew it was not going to work, so he cried loudly in grief.</p>
<p>Unknowingly, A Fu had not gone to work in the factory for a week. At this time, in order to have money to take care of his poor child, he remembered that he had not received a week's wages from the factory. He calculated that he would spend these four yuan, and then beg Accountant Zhou for an advance of a week's wages, probably eight yuan, which would be enough for the burial and to hire a Taoist priest to chant some scriptures, because he only had one child, and he was the only one left alone in the future, so he didn't want to be too sloppy with the child.</p>
<p>He staggered into the factory early in the morning. There were only a few people in the factory. The watchman did not allow him to enter and asked him who he was looking for. He said that he was the factory's coppersmith, and his child had died. He wanted to borrow some money from Accountant Zhou. The watchman told him that he had taken too long of a leave, and the factory could not stop working. The foreman had already found a new worker to fill in. He also told him that his nameplate had been removed three hours after he took leave.</p>
<p>A Fu was shocked by this unexpected and great stimulus and almost fainted. He thought, "I work like a horse all year round. My child is sick and died. Shouldn't I take leave? Is it too much to take leave without pay?" This damn society, damn people, damn foreman! I'll kill him when I see him!" A pure, kind and honest A Fu was now like a tyrant, a mad dog, his eyes full of blood, clenching his fists and looking around, as if looking for someone to tear apart.</p>
<p>Near the factory, he waited for a long time. He saw men, women and children carrying baskets and entering the factory happily. Many of them were usually on good terms with him. He ran over to greet them. Some of them just said good morning to him, some ignored him, and some even smiled lightly at him. This threat was extremely great to him, so his dangerous and terrible thoughts became even more profound. He saw a pregnant man in a student uniform coming from afar. He recognized that the person coming was his enemy. He hid in a dark place, let the pregnant man walk past, picked up a stone, caught up and threw it at the back of the man's head. The man was knocked down.</p>
<p>At lunchtime that day, A Fu's neighbors were spreading the rumor that A Fu had beaten someone to death and had been arrested by the Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>Shanghai has no spring, and my heart has even less spring!</p>
<p>I have been living in this dungeon-like Shanghai for seven years, and he has passed seven springs. However, in Shanghai, I have never seen a spring. The four seasons seem to be the same, without autumn or winter. If there is any, it can only be tasted carefully in the activity of people, especially in the trembling posture of women. However, this is too bitter after all, I am so unlucky with women!</p>
<p>This is beyond my expectations. I live in such a high building, the quiet environment and the open window make me feel unusually comfortable. After work every day, I lean on the window to look into the distance, venting the accumulated depression in my chest and staring at the cluttered external scenery. In this way, although I sometimes seem like a infatuated person, I only have such a comfortable mood. I have no unreasonable thoughts and no expectations.</p>
<p>This is even more beyond my expectations. Recently, I found a lithe and graceful girl in a thatched cottage far outside the window. Her figure is so slender and soft, and her attitude is so gentle and innocent. The first time I saw her, I didn't care, because I was sure that she was not a product of the thatched cottage, but a dancing star from someone's house. However, I see her shadow every day when I look out the window. So, "Gradually, I began to have a heart of affection. Her frequent glances clearly express her thoughts. She is not like ordinary women who hate people like us!"</p>
<p>In order to obtain this little bit of ethereal comfort, I feel that Shanghai actually has a spring this year, as if I see spring dancing in front of the window. In fact, spring has already left the world, and now it is summer. My heart is even more filled with spring, washing away the accumulated depression of the past few years, my heart is jumping every moment, and life seems to have added a bit of vigor. But ah, I only have this little bit of affection, because I have already······</p>
<p>Girl, please cherish the spring in the world! I have no unreasonable thoughts and no expectations!</p>

<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>Last year, Tingtao Society published a book called "Words of the Meat-Eaters". Although I have not personally read it, according to friends, what is collected inside are the speeches made by those in power today when they were out of office. What these remarks are saying, I have not seen with my own eyes, so of course I dare not blindly speculate; but, if someone is willing to spend some time carefully reading it, they may also get a strange feeling!</p>
<p>There is no need to mention this, because I am not a hero with copper skin and iron bones who can fly over walls and walk on eaves. Now let's look back at the literary scene of our country in the past ten years:</p>
<p>In the "May Fourth" era, due to the influence of Western European liberal thought and the rise of the domestic bourgeoisie, a group of brave warriors carried out a movement of destruction of form to liberation of content against our country's "literature of morality" that had existed for thousands of years. This movement did achieve considerable success, and this group of brave warriors also rose to prominence as a result.</p>
<p>In the "May 30th" era, due to the agitation of the revolutionary upsurge, the trend of literature underwent another major change. In this change, a new group of heroes was able to ascend the throne.</p>
<p>The achievements of the warriors of the "May Fourth" era and the heroes of the "May 30th" era in overthrowing the old forces and establishing new literature at that time cannot be easily denied by anyone; but, now that they have achieved fame and fortune, what are they doing again?</p>
<p>We are not colorblind, we can see very clearly: among them, some have inexplicably started playing with antiques, writing ancient-style regulated poems, and giving each other gifts to show their elegance; some have surrendered to powerful families, writing servile articles praising their merits to please their masters; some are unrestrained and comfortable, playing in the mountains and rivers, singing about the wind and moon, and casually writing travel notes and miscellaneous feelings to entertain themselves? Not only the heroic spirit of the "May Fourth" and "May 30th" eras has long since disappeared; they also don't care what era it is now, or what impact this will have on the entire literary scene.</p>
<p>Some people say that the phenomenon in our country's literary scene is not much different from the situation in our country's officialdom. I dare not say whether this statement is correct or not. But, if someone were to ask these authoritative writers who have become immortals why they change so much, I believe that their answer would indeed be: "It was one time, and this is another time!"</p>
<p>This is "time", everyone believes; but, will the long flow of time stop from now on? I dare not say, and in fact there is no need for me to say.</p>

<p>"Education is omnipotent!" This is the view of Chinese scholar-officials. They try to use education to lead society and transform society, but the facts tell them that this is an illusion, just an illusion! They did not understand that education is the upper structure of society, and education is evolving there, following politics, especially economics.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>In this extremely dangerous environment, there are a group of educators who, when they realize that education is only a tool and cannot lead or transform society, become disappointed and sad, thinking that educators have no way to go.</p>
<p>Have educators really run out of options? No, absolutely not! There are many jobs waiting for educators in the field of education!</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Educators, prepare yourselves, prepare to shoulder the great historical mission assigned to you. The power of educators is limited today, but you must fulfill the responsibility that history has given you. Educators should do the preparatory work for social transformation.</p>
<p>At present, there are few considerable organizations for educators who have the same or similar ideas. Even if there are organizations, the motivation comes from people who are obsessed with heroism and messianism, which is very wrong. The organization that true educators should have is as solid as iron, and at the same time, it is an organization of the masses. In the organization, there are no heroes and no disciples!</p>
<p>At present, it is impossible for educators to have an organization with a certain mode in order to form a force. We can only make use of the environment and change the organization mode according to the environment.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Educators, prepare yourselves! Prepare for the work of social transformation! Organize first!</p>

<h3 id="e302">Li Cheng's Marital Entanglement <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Editor's Note</p>
<p>Of course, most marital entanglements these days stem from the flaws in the marriage system itself, and the parties involved are all "victims of a society in transition between the old and the new."</p>
<p>However, if we consider whether the "sacrifice" can be remedied, undoubtedly women still suffer more. Not divorcing, as Mr. Li says, causes pain to both parties, but after a divorce, the man can escape the sea of ​​suffering and be freed from "the pain inflicted by this unreasonable union," but what about the woman? Her suffering is even greater than if she hadn't divorced. This can be seen from Ms. Cheng's first letter: "I have three reasons for not wanting a divorce: First, I don't want to... If he divorces me, he can become a new groom, but I can't become a new bride. Second, after reading about the stepmother in 'Konggu Lan' (Empty Valley Orchid) who cruelly beats the son born to Ren Zhu, I worry that if I divorce, my two children will also suffer this pain. Third, my family is not a lower-class family... and I have not done anything bad. My parents would lose face if I divorced." The second and third concerns, though difficult to avoid in reality, do have remedies. As for the "first reason for not wanting," it is indeed a major problem. Mr. Li believes that not divorcing is "making her live as a widow," but if they divorce, can he remarry without suffering "the cruel punishment of living a lonely life"? In this society, it is probably very difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, in today's society, there is no appropriate and satisfactory remedy for marital entanglements. Mr. Li's views are very correct on this point. But I personally always believe that in an unreasonable marriage like this, the husband should sacrifice a little more. Even if the wife is very old-fashioned and the two parties simply cannot connect, he should not focus entirely on his own interests and rashly talk about divorce, let alone neglect her because he "loves someone new." Family happiness is indeed of great importance in life, but life is not entirely for the sake of love. Those who lack love can seek satisfaction and compensate for this deficiency in other aspects. Adam Smith remained unmarried throughout his life, but his spirit was not necessarily "extremely miserable." He regarded his academic achievements as the source of his happiness, transferring his marital love to academics. Of course, we do not expect everyone to be able to do this, but isn't it obvious that an unhappy marriage does not mean the complete loss of a person's happiness?</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the three questions you asked, they have been frequently discussed in the mailbag section, so I won't go into detail. Don't say that I arbitrarily assumed you "have someone new." I want to declare to you that I am indeed basing this on her "one-sided statement," but judging from the facts stated in her first letter, I'm afraid it is by no means fabricated. Editor</p>

<h3 id="e303">The Poor Gentleman (10) <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Written by George Gissing of England, translated by Sun Pu</p>
<p>The cheque was crossed. Mr. Dymond, for the first time in his life, realized that a crossed cheque could cause great trouble to the recipient. How was he to change it? His landlord was an eccentric miser, and Mr. Sharg's refusal to help, accompanied by the look he gave, would be a pure humiliation to him; moreover, it was highly doubtful whether Mr. Sharg himself could use the cheque. Who else could he entrust it to? Truly, there was no one in the city of London.</p>
<p>Oh, the first thing to do was to answer Mrs. Woolf's letter. He lit the lamp and sat at the dilapidated small pine table; but his pen, dipped repeatedly into the ink bottle, still could not find words to write.</p>
<p>"Dear Mrs. Woolf," 丨丨</p>
<p>Then, he stopped for a long time, as if he had dozed off for a while. Suddenly perking up, he began to write eagerly again.</p>
<p>"With sincere gratitude, I received your most kind and generous donation. This sum of money..."</p>
<p>(His hand rested again for several minutes.)</p>
<p>"...will be used as you wish, and I will send you a detailed account of the gift bestowed."</p>
<p>He had never felt that writing was so difficult. He felt that he was expressing himself very unsatisfactorily, and his mind was clogged. Finishing this letter required all his physical strength. After finishing the letter, he went out, bought a stamp at the tobacconist's, and then dropped the letter in the mailbox.</p>
<p>Mr. Dymond barely slept that night. As soon as he lay in bed, he began to think about where he would find the poor people worthy of sharing this kindness. Of course, he did not know the class of people Mrs. Woolf thought he knew. In a sense, all the families around were poor, but 丨he asked himself丨did poverty have the same meaning for them as it did for him? In this dirty street, were there any men and women who could rightfully call themselves poor compared to him? A educated man, forced to live among these lower classes, had reached all sorts of interesting conclusions about these lower classes: one conclusion had long been fixed in Mr. Dymond's mind, namely, that the "suffering" of these classes was greatly exaggerated by observers according to an extremely inappropriate standard. Around him, he saw a crude form of amusement, satisfying labor, and a brutal, insensitive world. In his opinion, almost undoubtedly, he was the only one in this street who felt poverty and suffered from poverty.</p>
