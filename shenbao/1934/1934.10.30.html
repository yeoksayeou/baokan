<h3 id="c19">僞滿煤油專賣與九國公約 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 英。</p>
<p>世界列強對於殖民地的最大要求。在於資本輸出的擴張和資源供給的獨佔。在日本人的眼光看來。僞滿本來無異於殖民地。九一八後所謂日滿統制經濟論。亦就應運而生了。這次日本趁著海軍預備會議的當兒。指使僞政府公然宣布煤油販賣的統制制度。結果乃引起了以操縱世界煤油市塲著稱的英美荷三國的抗議。他們知道這是日人排斥在滿外人勢力的開端。什麼菸草專賣和金鑛專利的新法。亦將接踵而來。</p>
<p>照僞滿煤油統制計劃的初竟。一方面禁止煤油氣油及機器油進口。（生油由專利公司輪入。另由政府規定其價格。）一方面則積極開發境內的油礦。使其產量足以供給本地的消費。兼充日本海軍的燃料之用。所謂日本燃料國策的真精神。即在於此。據我國地質調查所的報告。上年度遼寗省鞍山。撫願。本溪湖三處的煤油產額共有四五五七八七桶。超過我國各地所產的不下有一百七十倍之多。可是日人仍不以此自滿。再進一步而設立了滿洲石油株式會社。從事於煤油的採掘精煉和販賣。該會社的資本原定五百萬元。大多數股權屬於以特殊國策爲使命而又帶有半官性質的滿鐵公司。其工廠說在關東租借地。可見其與日本關係的密切。和最近日政府狡辯的滑稽。至於油的供給。單說撫順一處。就有五十四億　噸的預想藏量。其中用露天採掘法而可取的。亦在三億　零三百萬噸。輕油二萬五千噸。重油七萬五千噸。并在計劃增加資本八百萬元。一旦其整個的理想完全實現。英美荷三國在滿的煤油業縱不至於消滅。亦將遇到一個勁敵。而其有助於日本海軍的戰門力。更爲識者所公認。</p>
<p>對於世界煤油採取權的競爭。本是帝國主義者所優爲。這次向日本提出抗議的英美兩國。更是簡中的巨擘。過去波斯。壘蘇爾。壘西哥。蘇門答嚴。等處的油權競爭史。都以英美爲中心。競爭的經過彰彰在人耳目。尤其爲日本所羨慕。日本是帝國主義者集圖中的後起之秀。自恨顯身於國際政治舞臺爲時太晚。不能暢所欲爲。所以她對於冒天下大不題而攖來的滿洲權利。當然要視作禁衡而不肯絲毫放棄。這次英美兩國聯合荷蘭提出對日抗議。而其抗議的理由卻根擴於九國公約。九國公約早爲日本一手所撕毀。英美等國不於和約撕毀的當兒。實行其阻止或糾正的義務。到了今天才利用破碎的公約去和人日人辦交涉。那能得日人滿意的答覆。可憐我們弱小的中國人。在主權被侵領土淪亡的時候。大聲疾呼著。結果除了空洞的同情論調以外。得不了絲毫國際的援助。什麼條約和公約的條文。引了又引。說了又說。直到舌敝唇焦心灰意懶以後。亦就彷彿覺得和日人抱著同樣的感想。以爲這些條文不過是破紙上所遣留的幾滴殘墨了。誰知道這幾滴殘墨。在日本外務省發表四一七聲明書的時候。會有那樣的價值。誰知道在關東軍禁止英美軍隊在山海關附近操練的時候。會有那樣的權威。又誰知道在滿洲國宜布煤油販賣統制的時候。會有那樣的意義。可惜這種價值。權威和意義。只在其他締約國的權利遭受妨害時。才爲我們所領略。那末。號稱平等條約的比較既往的不平等條約。又強些甚麼呢。</p>
<p>我們又連帶記得。日本發表四一七聲明書以後。我國朝野中人頗有設法召集九國公約簽約國會議的意思。可是國際方面的消息傳來。說是這事就能提出。亦決沒結果。不料到了現在。居然又有九國公約四字在報章中佔著顯赫的地位。而淪亡已久的僞滿又居然有人記起仍是中國的領士了。</p>
<p>不過我們亦知道。英美荷三國在對日抗議書中提及九國條約中的門戶開放。只是外交上的策略。內幕中的對抗武器當然不止這一點。</p>

<p>將派商務專員赴暹羅視察</p>
<p>日貨銷暹年遣一千餘萬金</p>
<p>曼谷特約通訊、自英屬馬來亞及荷屬東印度、先後實施統制貿易、限制日本貨之輸入後、日本貨在南洋之市塲、大受打擊、日本商人曾大起恐慌、紛紛要求其政府與英荷兩國殖民地當局交涉、但英國政府爲保護其主要工業蘭開夏紡織品市塲之被奪起見、此次對於限制日本棉織品之輸入南洋英屬殖民地、似已抱有極大決心、故日方雖數度抗議、而卒無效也、至於荷屬方面、自荷印政府宣佈五十六種商品入品限制律後、因日方之嚴重抗議、爲和緩尖銳衙突起見、乃有日荷會議之召集、但該會自六月中開幕以來、迄今已數月、時傳開展、時傳開展、時傳緊張、至今　未有絲毫之進步、日方處於此種環境之下、既不甘束手待斃、則惟有在南洋另闢途徑、以求其商品之出路耳、</p>
<p>南洋羣島除英何兩國之殖民地外、他若美屬之菲律賓及法屬之安南、早有極高之關稅壁壘、阻止非宗主國貨品之大量輸入、故在以上兩地、日本亦自難滿足其慾望、日方於苦思焦慮、努力鑽營之結果、乃謀擴充一新市塲、此新市塲爲何、即逞羅是也、暹羅位於馬來半島東北之印度支那半島上、爲南洋唯一之獨立國、面積約十九萬五千方里人口約一千萬、人民以務農爲主、工業除搗米廠及鋸木廠外、其他輕重工業皆極落後、故爲工業品最良之市塲、而暹羅對於日本、過去在政治上、亦有相當之聯絡、如去年國聯大會表決否認僞國時、世界各國代表一致投否認票、而暹羅代表獨棄權、以表示對日之好感、是以現時日本於遭受南洋各國殖民地限制其商品輸入之際、乃不得不向暹羅擴充其市塲、以謀補救、</p>
<p>據此間所得消息、大阪日商務院、以改善日暹兩國貿易現狀爲藉口、最近將派遺商務專員來暹談商、其目的可想而知、按近年日貨每年之輸入暹羅者、其總值已逾一千二百萬日金、（約合暹幣八百萬鈸）而暹羅物產每年之輸入日本者僅值八十萬日金（約合暹幣六十萬鈸）而已、日本對暹貿易出超已逾一千一百餘萬日金、而尤積極計劃擴充、雖云受英荷限制、不得不然、但日人之野心亦無可掩飾、吾人若反觀我國對暹貿易之情況、其相去實不可以道里計、據調查、本年自一月起至八月止、輸入我國之暹羅物產、其總值爲二千五百五十萬元、而在此同時期內、我國商品之輸入暹羅者僅八百八十餘萬元、我國入超竟達一千六百七十餘萬元、至我國旅暹之華僑約有二百五十萬之多、較之日僑高出數十百倍也、</p>

<p>一各位縣長、今天聽到各位的報告、知道各位到於保甲的意義及其法令規章、已經有了深刻的認識和詳細的研究、因此知道各位對於省廳的功令、并非當作具文、是有決心去施行的、這是本人所極引爲欣慰的事、</p>
<p>保甲的意義、各位都已經明瞭、不用本人再說、我現在想把保甲這個制度的精神、就本人所感覺到的、特別提出來和各位說一說、保甲這個制度、是中國古時傳留下來的地方政治制度、是一種地方政治的下層其本組織、這個組織的特點、是在以戶爲單位、換句話說、就是以家爲單位、與歐美各國的一切組織、以個人爲單位的、顯然不同、這個組織的基礎是家庭、這個組織的立足點、是建築在倫理的親念土面的、這是保甲制度的特色、也就是他的精神、保甲這個制度的要求、就是希望每戶有一個好的戶長、戶就是家、希望每家有一個好的家長、管理一家的子弟、不許一家之內有壞人來往、十家爲甲、甲有甲長、希望每家有一個好的家長、管理一家的子弟、不許一家之內有壞人來往、十家爲甲、甲有甲長、希望一甲之中或十家之內有一個好的甲長、或好的大家長、管理這十家的子弟、不許士家之中有壞人來往、十甲爲保、保有保長、希望一保之內或百家之中、有一個好的保長或一個的好的大家長、管理這百家的子弟、不許與壞人來往、中國家族固有的精神、最足以代表中國倫理的精神、最顯然的是家族之中富有除暴安良的精神、富有周急濟貧的精神、可惜這種精神在都市里面出了不良的子弟、家長就要以用家法去制裁他、聚族而居的地方、族長更可以運用他的威權監督或制裁他的不肖子弟、甚至騙出族外、這是除暴安良的精神、不但如此、家族的精神還充滿了周急濟貧的精神、貧寒的子弟、窮苦的族人、常常賴以維持、例如歷史上或現在各處所有的義莊養田、就是這種精神的具體表現、所可惜的、是中國受了近代潮流的影響、連家族以內的這種精神、也漸漸的消滅了、所以我們舉辦保甲、是要把這種精神恢復起來、推廣起來、發揚到家族以外、由家族而至於總理所說的國族、也就是齊家治國的道理、本人覺得保甲根本的精神完全在此、</p>
<p>保甲是一種工具、并不是目的、這個工具就是組織民衆訓練民衆的工具、所以保甲辦好了、就是把民衆組織好了、民衆組織好了、然後訓練民衆、民衆訓練好了、然後我們要如何運用就可以如何運用、我們要運用到消息極方面就可以自術、就可以除暴安良、當作鄉村警察用、當作地方自街軍隊用、當作國防軍的細胞用、我們要運用到積極方面、就可以築道路、興水利。訓練四權。以及其他一切社會或物質的建設。成爲一切自治事業的基本隊伍、年來各地多匪、地方治安有時發生問題、加以國際形勢的險惡、地方自衛、成爲一致的要求、自然保甲有迫切的需要、即以自治而論、江蘇辦自洽巴辦了若干年了、究竟成績如何、所以我們爲努力完成自治起見、也非速辦保甲、把這自治的基本工具組織辦好了不可、許冬人誤會、以爲江蘇辦保甲不辦自治、殊不知保甲是工具、自治是目的、我們爲了地方自衛、固然要辦保甲、藉以達到自衛的目的、我們爲了完成江蘇的地方自治、更要論保甲、藉以達到自治的目的、我時常發現中國社會內有一種很心怪而又危險的現象、就是好人沒有組織、安分守已的好人沒有組織、而土匪也有士匪的組織、流氓有流氓的組織、乃至乞丐有乞丐的組織、組織是一種力量、好人沒有組織、就是好人沒有力量、壞人有組織、就是壞人有力量、這種現象、是何等的危險、長此以往不待外人來消滅中國、中國的好人也就會被中國的壞人受漸消滅完了、保甲的用處、就是要把好人組織起來、運用好人的力量、掃除社會的罪惡、促成社會的進步、保四既然這樣重要、所以本省於今春決定舉辦保甲、并且定了進的步驟、於江北銅山東海淮陰南通鹽城五個行政督察區所屬的各縣、先行舉辦、次及江都區及江南各驅、規定於四月開始施行、後因種種原因、致進行稍微遲綏、（未完）</p>

<p>— 許振華。</p>
<p>四遊牧蒙人之生活禮俗綏遠蒙人計島蘭察佈盟六旗，伊克昭盟七旗，共十三旗，外又有土默特一旗，該旗人民雜居漢人縣治已久，與漢人同化，風俗習慣，毫無差異，至島伊二盟十三旗，佔地八十六萬方里，人口二十萬，其中除遠函罕一旗屬喀爾喀種外，其餘均屬額爾多斯種，故共生活禮俗，雖與漢人逈別，而各旗彼此之間，則大同小異。蒙人生活，簡單樣素，大多從事遊牧，不會耕種，居處多爲蒙古包，包爲圓形，普通周園約二丈，圓頂構造如傘，外披羊毛氈，門開東南尚，設木框，裝小扉二，包可解拆攜帶，蓋遊牧生涯，逐水草而居，時須搬遷，不得不如此也，包之解拆結椎，多出婦女之乎，其動作敏捷，其分鐘之內，可以解下，半小時之內，可以搭起，包內設置，地舖羊毛氈，正中爲灶，西邊爲男子坐臥處，東邊爲婦女坐臥處，並放置不櫃水缸等家具，西北角則供神櫃，夜間就寢，既無牀榻，亦無被褥，和衣橫臥於地氈上而已，食品則以羊肉，炒米，茶磚，牛羊乳爲主，乳有多種製法，用火徐煮，取其上凝結之脂肪層爲奶皮子及黃油，殘餘部分，於日光中曝乾，揑成圓塊，名爲酸奶，其味既酸又臭，，要非習慣，決難下嚥，此外將乳汁和鷄蛋白糧者乾，爲敬客珍品之奶豆腐，又將乳汁貯缸內，使之發酵，日久可成乳酒，至於衣服，除王公富戶有穿綢緞者外，平民均爲棉布，來源仰給於漢人，式樣尚沿滿清舊制，長袍束帶，男女無甚差別，惟顏色略有不同，大概普通男子穿藍色，灰色，有孝服者衣青色，女子則年輕衣紅緣，年老衣藍紫，而喇踓則衣紅黃紫三色，新衣上身後穿至礦爛爲止，自始至終，不加洗滌，綜觀蒙人衣，食，住，三者，無一合於衛生條件，染有疾病，亦無醫藥，故其死亡率甚高。又蒙人當喇嘛者甚多，家有三男，必有一喇嘛，故喇嘛人數幾佔全人口三分之一，人民之所以喜當喇嘛，除迷信成佛，希冀來世幸福外，尚有其他三大原因，一，爲避免徭役，喇嘛不受王公管理，可免一切差役，二，由於虛榮，喇嘛地位尊貴，對王公亦不須不跪致敬，一家之中，如無喇嘛，必爲人所恥笑，三，由於喇嘛生活安閒，每日除誦經外，不必再爲衣食掙扎，喇嘛多住廟凡三百六十八所。至於蒙人禮俗，結婚亦由父母媒灼決定，普通男子十五六歲議婚，女子則恒長男子三四歲，財禮爲牛，羊，馬，衣服，珊瑚，銀器等，多寡視貧富而異，結婚之日，先由新郎騎馬至女家迎親，女家親友立於門外作拒納狀，然後新娘出門上馬，繞已家蒙古包疾馳三匝，再由戚友一二十人陪行，與新郎並馬同至其家，新娘下馬入包，拓灶神畢，由男家男子長輩一人，呼持竹筷一支，將新婦頭髪從中向兩邊分開，是爲分頭禮，蓋蒙俗處女，髪向後梳，出嫁之後，則向左右分開，兩髪掛珊瑚銀板等爲飾，故分頭禮爲出嫁之重要儀式，行分頭禮後，乃欵待來賓，婚禮遂畢，又出嫁婦女於未養子女之先，可任意返家，既養子女之後，必俟其長大成人，能獨自在外騎馬馳聘，然後再經喇嘛誦經，始許其母返娘家行走，若夫婦不和，男女均可提出離異，惟女子提出離婚，須返還男家財禮之全部或一部，離婚後，男女均可自由再婚，此爲婚禮大概，喪禮儀式，少數學漢俗用棺柩埋葬，大多數行火葬與棄葬二種，火葬又多行於富有之家，其法將死屍火化，取骨灰研細，和以麵粉，揑成入形，長約數寸，藏於大廟之靈塔中，棄葬最爲普徧，即將屍身，拋棄山野，任島獸啄食，如三日之內屍尚完整，則爲死者生前罪孽深重，必請喇嘛誦經，爲之懺悔。</p>
<p>蒙人生活簡單，婚喪之外，別無其他特殊俗尚，一年節日，僅注意祭灶，過年，其儀式亦甚簡單，至若其他文化敎育，更無足言，除喇嘛識藏文能吟佛經外，普通人民識字者，百不得一，際此世界文明日新月異之時代，蒙人生活，猶復簡陋如此，若非速謀改進，則將來恐不易與其他民族作生存之競爭也。</p>
<p>綜觀上述各節，可知綏遠社會腐敗，民生艱苦各種狀況，救濟辦法，雖不易言，但依紀者管見，首應禁止鴉片，救濟婦女，終不能因變戲食，遣害人民，煙妓既除，社會根本元氣目復，然後再言剿匪，剿匪辦法宜冬設鄉村保衛園，切實訓練，人民若有自衛力量，匪即不難肅清，匪患既除，農村基礎稽定，再須設法收回天主堂地產，限制天主堂非法勢力，使不致爲害村民，然後進行各種建設，另一方面應與築通內蒙各旗道路，便利漢蒙人民往來，敎導蒙人耕種方法，改良蒙人生活方式，與辦蒙人學校，灌輸科學知識，破除佛敎迷信，提個漢蒙結婚，使種旗間隔膜泯減，如是則漢蒙人民均能安生樂業，而開發西北，庶幾有望。（完）</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　未解鹽零規門憐少女願聞困苦惜玉訪貧家</p>
<p>那個呼鍋塊的老婦人便道：窮人過日子。有什麼看頭？不過苦得要命罷了。志前道：我就是要知道怎樣苦得要命了。老人家請坐下，我們談談。那老婦人且不回答他的話，卻一歪一拐，走到胡嫂子面前問題：這位老爺是幹什麼的，是來放糧的吧？那真是太陽照進了屋子了。他雖然是低聲問著，可是他那話音，志前卻是聽得清清楚楚。這覺得他們對於自已，卻有一種很厚的希望，若是，就這樣走了，倒有些不好意思。本待是進來看看就走的，這一句放糧的話，卻僵得他站在院子中心，不知道如何是好呢。胡家嫂子倒要借了這個機會，質弄他有拉攏的能耐，瞇著眼向志前望了，笑問那老婦人道：我不是說了，我這外甥女兒，要給他找個人，笑問那老婦人道：我不是說了，我這外甥女兒，要給他找個人家嗎？小西天住的客人，倒有願意的，不過還沒有切實的話。這位老爺……說到這里，低了聲音，向那老婦，唧唧喳喳說了一遍。志前如何看不出，這情形未免令人難受，臉也都隨著紅了，心里一轉念，到了這里，含糊不得。便道：這位嫂子，你們親戚的事，我倒也聽見說一點，我倒是有一番好意，想勸你們不要這樣辦呢。志前說這話，急忙之中，是要洗刷自已不是那看這位姑㛄的，可並沒有替他們另想出路的意思。可是胡嫂子一直誤會到底，總以爲他是愛惜月英而來的哩。於是又要問他第二個認爲可行的辦法了。（五二）</p>
<h3 id="c194">菜秧汛 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 高金獄</p>
<p>八月九月之交—菜秧汛，是浦左塘畔一帶農家重要的季節。他們匆迫地把供給都市人們消暑的西瓜黃金瓜類枯萎的蔓藤根本刪去，細載似的鋤坭瑣碎，一條條的腰溝鈞勒得錯落有致。田床平舖如碈，勻施肥料，這好像靚妝的美人，出得門來，回眸重敷鉛華。這樣，也許天雨浸潤，土地凝腐了，然後再加一番搓細功夫。於是散播什麼長梗榻棵和雪里藝等菜子，輕盈地步履壓踏，不到三四天，便茁芽分辯了。</p>
<p>護植菜秧和保育蠶桑一樣的劬勞，自茁芽至三四寸高，經過一個月的過程中，非但要雨暘時若，且須天天的勻梳剔理祛除蝨蛆。菜秧最大的仇敵是沉蛆，其次是咀蛆，倘使菜秧上發現了咀蛆，只要用藥末毒殺，仍可無礙。但經沉蛆的漫田遍野的逐附，那末便似附骨之疽，菜秧祗有天天剝蝕憔悴，以至沉惙不起咧。</p>
<p>中秋瑩澄的月光，照徹平舖青蔥的菜秧，好比綽約的青女素娥，憧憧往來於綿滕繡陌間。農家祭月焚斗之餘，莫不喜形面色，表示出短時間的勞苦，將得到超過他種農作物數倍以上的收穫。</p>
<p>不增的塘畔農家，也逃不出這農村末落悲哀的雰園。在充滿希望數天之後，他們可愛的菜秧，差不多全給沉蛆沉倒了。他們除掉血汗的勞作外，還損失雇工肥料藥末等本錢，可憐他們的本錢，都是高利貸來的，地租當然是沒法償付了。</p>

<p>— 一震</p>
<p>橋上橋下站滿了人。騷擾的氛園，籠罩了了這站著的人們。</p>
<p>一個後生牽出雙瘦老疲勞的牛兒，從一個破茅屋里，緩緩地緩緩地向這大石橋走。這老牛像預知將有大禍來臨，針住後腿不肯走，於是這後生憤怒地緊拉繩子。牛兒熬不住學子的酸痛而繼續向前走。緩緩地緩緩地。</p>
<p>走上大石橋。拍搭！另一個後生驀地舉起大木棒在瘦牛腿上猛擊一下，這老牛伏啦！一聲聲沉長而悲痛的鳴聲。</p>
<p>於是又跑上兩個後生，四個壯年。敏捷地把老牛的瘦細的腳兒緊緊地縛住。呵！一根絕細的繩子斷送了老牛一切的自由。跟著尖銳的大石塊，不停地猛擊在龐大的牛頭上。老牛擺動著失了自由的腳，忍受著。一點點的鮮血從創傷了的口里流出，一滴滴的熱淚，從無神的老眼里滴下，啞了的鳴聲，沈長而且悲痛。</p>
<p>終於這悲痛的鳴聲慢慢地微弱，微弱。以至於停止……</p>
<p>兩個後生拖著牛腿，摜在橋腳的空地上。兩把尖銳雪亮的小刀，先後把爲入們走過千萬里的腳趾割啦！接著又把龐大的頭頗砍啦！……鮮血染紅了將黃的草。</p>
<p>呵！勞苦一生！只換到這樣一個結束呵！</p>

<p>這些話，也許有人要認呼是冷血動物呢。</p>
<p>小兒把竹竿去打蟹，蟹怒了，舉起兩只大鰲來抵抗，把竹竿鉗得很緊，小兒便捉得蟹了。</p>
<p>倘若蟹自已曉得識相，不把兩鰲來鉗夾竹竿，涵養功深，毫不發怒，那有被小兒捉住之理。懲憤息怒，是明哲保身之道呀！</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>官員的架子，多少總得比小兵大方一些。他們雖是一般也低下了頭跪著，但上半身還是挺直的，這樣就比蝦蟆式的俯伏，神氣得多了。然而這些官和這些兵的服色，卻是一律十分整齊而美麗的：倒像是兩行活動的燈綵，特地爲著歡迎太后而設下的。我們就在這兩行活動的燈綵的中間，坐著黃色或紅色的大轎，徐徐地行過：再加那些拾轎的太監，又是全披著極華貴的宮裝：因此，使這一幕喜劇的佈景，格外的綵爛奪目了！那時候，恰巧太陽正在一天中的全盛時期，光芒非常強烈，射照在這些大紅大緣的顏色上，頓使我們的行伍，炫耀得和一條長虹一樣，誰見了都不免要停住步看著。</p>
<p>我們的隊伍，色調雖是如此的濃艷美觀，但在精神上，卻依舊非常的莊嚴肅穆，簡直是聲息全無。便是那些抬轎的小太監，也一些沒有什麼聲音做出來。這倒不是因爲他們的腳步太輕的緣故，而是全賴地下所舖的一重半濕的黃沙，把他們的足音，一古腦兒的給掩住了。在這樣肅靜的空氣中，我們直僵僵地的在轎子里坐著，真和那些泥彫木塑的神像有些彷像：又像是譬盡上或油畫上所繪著的故事畫中的人物，忽因某種奇怪的魔術的作用，重復又回生過來，排著隊伍，在街上行走。</p>
<p>在奉天，像這樣聲勢赫赫的大儀仗，也許在幾百年中，不容易見到一回：這一回偏是又許那些做官的得以躬逢其盛。凡屬尋常百姓，一概都不準觀看。（一六二）</p>

<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>黃菊破綻，丹楓染脂，正是秋景宜人出遊的時序。我們假使旅行到湖州，山色湖光，大可使人遊目聘懷，像白雀，雲巢，道塲，諸名勝，必須要利用船雙由水道前進的，正和嘉興遊煙雨樓一樣要雇船。</p>
<p>每天東方剛剛透出魚肚白色時，伊們就起身鹽洗，出落得非常整潔，伊們的服裝，大都是玄色的湖縐製成的，提倡土產湖縐，在婦女國貨年里是值得禮讚的。可是一雙天足，很下過一番藝術的整理，一雙黑緞子繡花的皮底拖鞋，真是纖塵不染，到了船中以後，熟識的遊客，有時可以看見伊腳指上染的各色寇丹，肉腿是指拭了待芳沁腿粉。</p>
<p>曉霧迷濛的時際，館驛河頭，是她們招呼遊客生意的市塲，說話的技巧和語調，是純粹的湖語，風趣雅然。</p>
<p>待遊客下船以後，解纜開船，煙波蕩洋，很能使人腦筯一清，搖到遼䦚的河港中，遊客可以要求伊唱一雙桃花江是美人話一類新式歌詞。搖船時柳腰的擺動，卻好似舞女的腰一般柔軟！</p>
<p>到了吃午飯的時候，伊們有做得很可口船菜，停泊在湖心里飲酒，伊又可替你執壼陪飲，但是遊資並不昻貴，三四人同遊，可稱得經濟的旅行。</p>

<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>素來急性的張先生，這大，他到麵店里去吃麵，坐下之後，他剛剛同堂館告訴他要吃的什麼麵，來不及等堂館轉身，早一疊連緊催麵快來，不到一分鐘，早催逼得掽桌擊凳，聲勢洶洶。好容易等到瞧見堂倌托著一碗熱氣騰騰的肉麵，向他走來，張先生忙舉起竹筯，預備開口大唁。那知堂倌卻振振有辭的回答道：客人吃完麵，碗是要收去的，洗好了再好盛麵給別的人吃，可是我也是急性的人，等不及你吃完了麵收碗，所以將麵倒在樓上，好將這碗收了，再做別的生意。張先生聽了，氣上加氣，一時卻苦沒有理由去駁斥堂信，祗得丟下筯子，氣哰哰的跑回家中，將這事向他妻子說了，接著說道：你想氣不氣？我還有什麼面目活在世上。非自殺不可！妻子贊成道：你目殺很好，不過你自殺後，我勢必改嫁，我也是個急性的人，請你先給我找了個後夫，然後再行自殺。張先生夫婦正談論間，忽的轟然一聲，磚石紛飛，傍邊牆上，早開了個窟隆里，鑽了過來。大聲說道：嫂嫂，不要性急，改嫁給我好了。一邊又向張先生道：我也是個急性的人，所以來不及出前門，進前門的遼兜遠轉，祗好打穿牆譬，鑽過來了。</p>
<h3 id="c201">烤肉 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>王先生這天忽忽的拎了一塊有精有肥的肉回去，交給他的妻子，吩咐他道：你把這肉白烤，須烤得爛些，才入味好吃。可明白麼？他妻子撅起嘴兒道：爲什麼不明白？你不要嘮嘮叨叨了。王先生聽了，就出去辦事，到了十二點鐘，回到家里，預備吃飯，他一踏進門，見他妻子泥身是汗，穿著短衣從里面趕將出來，喘喘說道：累死人！累死人！你要丟肉，害我出了不知多少大汗！王先生問道：可烤好了麼？他妻子道：快好了！還不十分大爛，你的肉筯筯牽牽的，真不大好丟呢！說完他就進去，拾出一塊黑黑的東西，擲給王先生道：你看不是還十分爛麼？王先生一看那塊肉早弄得像一塊污泥，那里再好吃。氣得笑出來道：你把這肉，究竟怎樣烤的？他妻子道：你說丟肉，我就把一根繩子擊了肉，在里面丟著，已丟得出了多少汗了。王先生聽了，氣得無言可說，隔了好久，才道：我說的是烤肉，是把內洗乾凈了，放在火上清烤，並不是呌你這樣丟肉判！隔了一天，王先生又買了豆腐回去，可是他還沒有出門，他的妻子，已追出來道：你敎我的法子好！你去看，你去看。王先生莫明其妙，趕到盜下一看，見那幾塊豆腐，已給他妻子弄成一錢白膩膩的豆腐漿了。</p>

<p>李先生在電影院散出來的當兒，發覺他袋中的皮夾，給倫兒倫去了，忙急急一找，見前面有一個衣衫㩜褸的人，正在急行，就奔過去將那人抓住，那人一見李先生，發急說道：先生，我沒爲偷你的皮夾。李先生想他假使沒有倫皮夾，如何能知道失竊皮夾呢？不由分說，將那人扭交警察，固然在那竊賊身上，將他失去的皮夾，原將搜出。警察問李先生怎樣發覺失去皮夾的，於是李先生就將失竊皮夾的慒形，繪形繪聲的演述出來。那知李先生正說得起勁，那個偷見，卻對他駁正說道：先生，你說得話，完全不對，我不是那樣下手，是這樣倫你皮夾的。偷兒說時，還做著乎勢，於是李先生見了，不由發笑，警察也笑了，四圈看的人，也跟著笑了，可是等他們笑停，那偷兒，早已在他們發笑的時候，一溜煙逃走了。</p>

<p>一整理院系過去大學設置院系、往往不顧師資設備、任意設置、以致影響其他院系、均鮮良好成績、且各校院系、頗多重複、尤以上海北平兩處爲甚、以北平而論、二十年度公私立大學及獨立學院共有十二校、分三十餘學院、（獨立學院中之科視作學院）、一百三十餘學系、就院別論、計文學院、法學院如下、理學院七、他如農。工。醫等畢院各有一二個、再就系別而論、一百三十餘學系中、計中國文學系、經濟系各十、政治系、外國文學系各九、法律系、物理系各七、史學系、哲學系、數學系各六、敎育學系社會學系、化學系各五、生物系、心理系各四、地理系音樂系各二、此外各學系各有一二個不等上海各大學院系重複的情形與北平相似、其他各省市、院系的重複、則較少、但因此敎育部分別合飭酌加裁併、或停止招收新生、分年結束、如北平大學女子文理不院哲學敎育系的裁撤、國文史地兩系併爲文史系、商學院與法學院合併改稱法南學院、設商學系、國際貿易、工商管理、交通管理三系、自本年度起不得再招新生、北平師範大學社會系裁撤、清華大學法律系裁撤、暨南大學敎育學院取銷、原有各學系改併爲敎育學系併入文學院、法學院裁撤、原有學生轉入國立中央大學法學院肄業、河南大學社會學系停招新生、土木工程系裁撤、河南大學社會學系停招新生、土木工程系裁撤、中國文學系與史學系合併爲文史系、法學院除經濟系外、不再招生、俟法律、政治兩系現有學生結束後、經濟系併入文學院、山西敎育學院及山西法學院均歸併於山西大學、四川大學敎育學院裁撤改爲敎育系併入文學院、安徽大學數學及物理兩系合併爲數理系、法學院裁撤、原有學生、或令轉學或酌改系、河北法商學院全部停止招生、其他各校重複院系及師資設備缺乏、無力發展的院系、均經令飭自擬裁併計畫、呈部核行、其目的在完全減少、重複與適應實際需要、使各校人力財力集中、從事於特殊的充實與發展、</p>
<p>二充實設備據二十年度統計、全國專科以上學校新添設備費約六百四十萬元、二十萬元、可見近來各校各年新添設備費、約均在六百四十萬元左右、不能不說是有了相當的進步、二十年度全國新添設備費六百四十萬元中、圖書費佔百分之十七、儀器。標本。機器等費佔百分之二十六、合計爲百分之四十三、其餘百分之五十七、大都爲建築修繕以及校具雜項等費、二十一年度新添設備費六百二十餘萬元中、圖書費佔百分之一八。最近新添設備費六百五十餘萬元中、圖書費佔百分之一八。八、儀器。標本。機器等費佔百分之三一。八、最近新添設備費六百五十餘萬元中、圖書費佔百分之三十二、若是把三年比較一下、最近的圖書費較二十年度約增加百分之二、較二十一年度約增加百分之○。二、儀器。標準。機器等費、較二十年度約增中百分之五。六、較二十一年度約增加百分之○。二、可見各校對於圖書。儀器等項設備確有相當的增加、不過這種增加、係指全體而言、個別看來、仍多未合法定標準、尤以私立者爲甚、照法令上的規定、大學設備費至少應佔經常費百分之十五、行政費不得超過百分之十、所以專科以上學校、對於行政費應力求減少、對於設備費應力求增高、敎育部除分別令飭各校對於儀器、圖書等項設備、謀確切的充實外、本年度核定私立專科以上學校補助費、設備費佔百分之八一。五、這就是特別注重設備的意思、</p>

<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>有病不服藥，常得中醫。平庸的才知，常得中人。足知多才，不爲善，就作惡，決不肯庸碌地過去。作著有利於爲善，爲著大都爲人，而作惡只顧自我，有才知的，寧願作惡。多一分才知，便多一分作惡的本領。本領好的，不見其惡，只見其善。惡被善粉飾了。所以老莊主張絕聖秦知。</p>
<p>然而老莊也是絕頂聽明的人。一部道德經，一部南華經，抉發人間世的隱秘，透澈極了。照理，罪惡應當減少。但從另一方面看來，卻又無異敎猱升木，不能減少，反而助長。這也許就是他們說了而又要想不說的苦衷罷。假如言辭換了行動，是可以成最大的奸慝的。</p>
<p>和這兩樣，則是自已現身說法，如懂得布幔的道理，而也罩上一層布幔。聰明的人，會說惜以今日我非昨日之我，舌頭一翻，搖身一變。其實也是自已揭去了布幔，又換上了一層布幔，或者簡直現了原形。</p>

<p>— 尹光</p>
<p>在黃昏的幕罩中，船慢慢地在巫山拋錨了。　　船客們已然踱上甲板，有的抱了煙袋，有的呵欠著，有的留心著茶房們的指點，大家都向江岸上，那城堡所在的一面，不住地縣送著好奇的探視，彷彿可以找出甚麼惹眼的建築，和熱鬧的市里一般。</p>
<p>然而，這里，映來人們眼里的，不過是一片剌目的荒涼而已。</p>
<p>那城市，就箕踞在一座不十分高大的土山頂上，低矮而且可憐。好像牠底故意蹲得高高的，並不是爲了要顯一座山城有的特點，而是讓人們來鑒賞牠的凋殘和落後。那就是說，在聯綿的擾亂中，在不良的自然條件下面，一個雖然寄託在一條重要江綫上的城鎮，是怎樣的在瀕於死滅了。</p>
<p>觀賞家們。搖頭，而且已經顯出喪氣的神情來了。他們好像一點也沒有感到甚麼興會。一個新出門模樣的青年人，瞪著眼睛，自言自語地嚷道：</p>
<p>呵喲，說了半天，就是這樣子麼？他還從鼻子里苦笑出來。</p>
<p>好多人都回轉到自已的舖位上去了。從昏濁的江面上，三數支灰褐色的劃船，在懶懶地闊浮過來。但既沒有呌賣食物的喧嚷，也聽不見一聲搶接客人的招喚。好像那些船主人的目的，本不過是想趕過來，分享一點所謂人世間的熱鬧一樣。然而因了這零零落落的點綴，江面上卻益加顯得清冷了。</p>
<p>有人上岸嗎？留在甲板上的人，無聊似的互相問詢起來。</p>
<p>後面來，後面來。小船這才比較出力地劃船輪船的船尾去。</p>
<p>不要延遲了，來找麻煩呵！獲船兵對凖各上岸的客人叮囑著。</p>
<p>當我同著一個茶役，和兩個小本煙土商人，從在一支破舊的劃船上時，夜色已經漸漸地加濃了。一種陰森的感覺包圍了我們。但是，雖然我們停泊的地方，依舊還在這漫長的峽道的中途，道陰森，卻是廣漢的荒涼的，並不帶得有山峽中應有的深沉和嚴肅。因爲從上游疾馳而來的山勢，到了這里，好像忽然地崩塌了，只留下一些土邱和小山，和一段亂石堆砌的江岸。</p>
<p>哎呀，芳房用乎上的空酒瓶指了船腔，呌道，你也出點錢補一下呢。</p>
<p>說得容易，補一下……</p>
<p>好像奇怪指責者的不識相似的，那船夫沒有說到底，便又懶懶地偏了頭，照管自已的劃板去了。</p>
<p>這是一個五十多歲的老者，沙白鬍子，面皮舊黑而多皺紋。他懶懶地揮使著他那鑲著新木的，破舊的劃板，腰肢伸屈著，半閉了眼睛，好像他底工作，倒並不是爲了吃食，而是在隨意消處他早已活壓了的時光。由於那茶役加緊的催促，不多久，船已經在拋江了。</p>
<p>老頭子，我向那現在只要照管住船的方位便行的船夫，問道，聽說神匪又繼同過麼？</p>
<p>是呀，又鬧呢。前幾天，軍隊纔開走。</p>
<p>於是那兩個煙土商人，移動了一下身體，也開始搬出自已的博識來了。就在這樣的談話當中，船彙了岸。於是，踱過一片雜著碎石的沙溺，走上那斜陸的小道，我們進到那荒涼的縣城里面去了。</p>
<p>然而說是縣城，那大小和熱鬧，其實，就拿別的區域里的塲鎮來比較，也是不相稱的。而目牠還保持著以前一切小市鎮的老樣，狹窄的街道，低矮的房舍，街路上橫著曬衣的竹竿和待劈的柴料。一個小孩子，一支手提著褲腰，一支手拿了一根籐鞭似的縴繩，哭嚷著，向幾支狂跑著的小豬奔過去了。</p>
<p>在幾家茶舖的階沿上，都有著熬製煙土的爐灶和設備。那兩個煙土商，正正經經地，去講自已的生意去了，茶房向一家暗洞似的簷下隱沒。而我，那時候已經十分灰䫋的我，卻獨自地在那街市上巡行著，直到在城門口集齊了我的同伴，那煙土商和茶房。</p>
<p>我們又踏上那陡斜的歸路了，但我依舊被一種不寧靜的心緒壓迫著。</p>
<p>一張先生，你把頭仰起看看！那茶房忽而用嘻笑的口調招呼我道，同時打開了他的電捧。</p>
<p>隨着那光線的指示，我向路側的電捍頂上望去了：那上面掛著三個已經失掉了血色的可怕的東西。但我並沒有如同伴們所希望的張惶。凝視了一忽，我仍舊回復了我自已的思路。</p>
<p>在劃子蠱攏輪船的時候，我們碰到了護船兵士的麻煩。</p>
<p>這是一九三一年秋天的事，第二天一早，船便進向那兩岸絕璧的巫峽了。</p>
<h3 id="c237">忠厚老實人 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 碧冰</p>
<p>洛夫是一個忠厚老實的人，這至少在他自已，是這麼自信的。雖然洛夫居住上海，是已經有了八九年，雖然除了上海以外，洛夫也曾跑過香港，澳門，天津，北平，漢口，青島，濟南，南京，九江等等的中國區域範團以內的商埠，雖然洛夫也曾經過許多方式不同的職業，如敎員，投稿者，軍隊中政治工作，鐵路上稽查等等之類，井且洛夫還曾經過各種不同方式的生活，如開十二三塊錢一間的房間，以及窮到無立椎之地之類，但，說來也許還沒有人相信。洛夫到現在，還可以說是一個忠厚老實的人。</p>
<p>世故人情，在洛夫自已，是以爲瞭解得非常深刻的，善惡智愚，無論相交時日的長短，洛夫都自以爲能夠判斷得明白：可是偏偏有許多人。認洛夫不瞭解世故人情，把他當作一個易於欺侮的人。而洛夫也便真的一次二次三次……被欺侮，玩弄，以增加他的閱歷。</p>
<p>這人是沒有希望的，他始終是打流窮。一點做人的法則都不知道。許多的人，將洛夫欺侮，玩弄了，反而要轉過頭來，這麼似乎懷著好意的來責備他。</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>洛夫受了責備，不能說出半句反駁的話來，因爲現在的社會，……尤其是上海或者其他都市，根本就不需要忠厚老實的人。忠厚老實的人，根本就不能在這種社會立足。洛夫受了責備，當然除了忍受及埋怨自已以外，是不能反駁他人了。</p>
<p>洛夫有時因爲被玩弄，欺侮所賜予的創痕太深了，敎訓太多了，也很想振作振作一下，做一個人，……自然是現代的人。和現代社會相適應的人，能說盧僞，欺騙的括的人，這麼樣，或者也可以在這個社會上立足。</p>
<p>喂！你今天到廣東去嗎？</p>
<p>不！我明天上漢口。</p>
<p>聽說你近來和黃君很接近。想你在不久之將來。也可以得意了。</p>
<p>黃君我不認識。這個人非常會用手段的，你們千萬不嬰上他的當。</p>
<p>這麼明知其是，而偏作不是的回答，在他人，許以爲洛夫真的善於做人了，能夠說虛僞欺騙的話了。所以心中也隱墜地對洛夫表示欽偑。以爲需子可敎也。然而，說來只有上帝才相信，當洛夫因刺激太深，而故意的說這些明知其是，而偏作不是的回答時，洛夫的內心痛苦難堪，是比較以赤膽忠誠待人，結果只有被他人以虛僞欺騙手段方法玩弄而受到的劇烈創傷還要超過若干倍數，因爲這，不但是欺騙了他人，也許還欺騙了自已，我做什麼事，對人說什麼話，何必要虛僞欺騙！這麼一般著想，也許洛夫要哭起來，跪在那位聽過洛夫盧僞欺騙的話的人面前，求他怒宥。</p>
<p>這是什麼一回事，神經病！</p>
<p>然而他人，畢竟是他人。他人聽了洛夫的虛僞欺騙的話，也許還不能知覺得到，認爲是真的以赤膽忠誠待人，也許知覺到，明知是假話，而欽偑洛夫做人乎段的痛明，但現在，等候洛夫說真話，而坦白的自已檢舉，悔過，反而來菲薄他的認爲洛夫的舉動是不近人情，結果，洛夫忠誠的悔過。反而被他人賤視。</p>
<p>這人真的沒有希望了，他還是自殺的好。</p>
<p>當面雖然沒有人這麼說，但背地里，是有人這種主張的，以後若和洛夫見面時，他人便露出輕視的容貌，或者敬而遠之了。</p>
<p>因此，洛夫所得的世故人情的經騐，雖然豐富，但畢竟無所應用，若應用反只有弄巧成拙，破壞了自身忠厚老實人的名節，這種理由根據，使洛夫以後待人，連半句謊話都不敢說，即偶然說錯了一二句話，也不得不急急的更正，恐怕他人又認爲自已在玩弄虛玄。</p>
<p>忠厚老實人，愈加名副其實的表現出他的忠厚老實。</p>
<p>因之洛夫所交的朋友，也只有小孩子，或者初步世故的少年人，因爲這些人，也和洛夫一樣是以忠厚老實待人，物以類聚，彼此才能契合。然而，等候那些小孩子或者少年人，長大了，懂得世故了，也會以虛僞欺騙待人了，則那時的洛夫，又被那些小孩子或者少年人所玩弄欺侮，以及輕視，洛夫又會和這些昔日視爲小孩子少年人的青年紳士，感情疏隔起來。於是，與他相交的又改一些新的小孩子少年人。可是未來的時日一到來，那些第二批（？）的小孩子少年人成了青年紳士，懂得世故人情之後，洛夫又只有和第三批（？）小孩子少年人相處了。這麼樣一個公式，走馬換將術的更遞，現在計算起來，已有了八九年的時日，在這些時日中，已經有了第五批（？）小孩子和少年人，成了當今社會的青年紳士，然而洛夫還是不長進，洛夫現在，只有和第六批小孩子和少年人相處。</p>
<p>洛夫永遠不能對於人生社會中最緊要的功課！世故人情，有所體騐，他將負著這賜與舖急厚老實人的諢名，一直到他的生命終了爲止了。</p>
<h3 id="c238">南洋之街一 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>平坦地，堅實地，舖著一層柏油。兩旁沒有樹木，沒有太高的，壯麗的房子。全是兩層或是三層的建築，而且並不很整齊：有的已經古舊了，有的卻是近代的建築物。但是你大概可以知道，支那人是永遠愛在舊店鋪里做他們的生意的。</p>
<p>朝東的趁著太陽還沒有起來的時候，就把白布蓬撐了起來，防著一個鐘頭以後那熱帶的太陽的蒸曬。在布面上，用著兩種甚至三種文字塗著店名：漢字和拉丁字擺在一塊兒是有怎樣的不同，你可以想像得到。</p>
<p>漸漸地，街上的人多了起來，車子也多了起來。人是裑雜不過的：如果你站在那馬來警察所站的待心瞧那麼二三十分鐘，展列在你的面前的就有如下各種不同的人類：</p>
<p>黃臉的支那人日本人。藍眼珠子的德國人，荷蘭人，英國人，葡萄牙人，美國人……。黑色的菲洲人，吉寧人，……（不準備你的人種學知識是不會分得清的。）</p>
<p>汽車里，坐著那些靠著歐洲大戰，由樹膠園而暴發了的人的子孫：回想到那些好往日，他們都會搖著腦袋太息。馬車像是這里的特殊存在物似地，很引起一些新來的人的好奇心，不轉睛地對著發動了四蹄往前奔跑的馬和車夫的身上瞧。腳踏車成羣結隊地來往著：上面坐的有時候你看去是妙齡的女人。她們駕車的純熟自然，誰都得感到驚異的　吧？</p>
<p>措著書包往學堂走的小學生，堆著笑臉，嘩啦地侭朝前衝，你走在他們的前面麼，一會兒他們便趕過你了。</p>
<p>生長在南洋的孩子總是活潑可受的。好動的，張勁的性格敎他們每天都得打一次架。你也許奇怪到馬來警察身上去：爲什麼看見孩子們打架而不加干涉呢？可是，你且等它十來分鐘，打輸了的會很貼服地跟著人走著他們的路。</p>
<p>推著Lce.crtam和檸樣水的吉寧人的小車子也在街上出現了，鈴聲叮叮地響著。有的人不管口渴不渴扔下三五個銅子就有一杯甜味的冰水可喝下去。吉寧人有著一臉的鬍髭，穿著紗緩緩地推著，打從那邊拐彎走了。</p>
<h3 id="c239">斗方（五） <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 爲何</p>
<p>看我暹疑不決的挑選不成，他又幫我翻來翻去的翻了半天。接著連乎也不烘，連靴子也不脫的，就幫我唐墨，裁紙，因爲怕紙裁錯，他小小心心的量了又量，摺了又摺，紙裁好了他又用手指在上面劃指紋，用母親的擦面粉在上面打著叉叉，口里不住的說：</p>
<p>要寫得勻凈，把位置配好，對子尤其要寫得一行筆直的，切忌寫得顛顛倒倒，歪歪曲曲……</p>
<p>他臉上顯著嚴肅的光鄉，皺皮一實一鬆的，不住的變著形相，嘴唇也彷彿因著過度興奮的剌激，顯出歪曲的樣子。他一面用那雙桔瘦的手，緊鉗著他特地輞來的新墨，一面兩雙巤眼在那本包著黑封套的百科全書上溜著，口一啟一閉，似乎在低聲吟哦。</p>
<p>我也買來了一枝新羊毫，是真正的斗方筆，這全是爲了張大爺的面子！</p>
<p>一切都佈置停當，以後，像開什麼展覧會似的，父親又去請了幾位鄰近的紳士來，看著我寫。這些人全是村里一等人物，鐵營欺詐，無惡不作。他們終年不作一點正事，卻都穿得講究吃得講究，不但卑鄙齷齪，而且驕傲得要命。我一向是㬇不上眼這些仁史的，正在父親卻請他們來看我寫字，像監考一樣，因此我對他們的惡感愈其高增了。</p>
<p>我聽到這些彷佛什麼都懂的，不要臉的寄生蟲，在不絕地讚美我：</p>
<p>恭喜恭喜，你生了這樣一個兒子，真是幸福極了！</p>
<p>有幾個卻掩飾不住的，用羨慕而且妒嫉的口吻說：</p>
<p>面子呀！張大爺賞的面子，還有什麼話講？</p>

<p>一整理院系過去大學改置院系、往往不顧師資設備、任意設置、以致影響其他院系、均鮮良好成績、且各校院系、頗多重複、尤以上海北平兩處爲甚、以北平而諭、二十年度公私立大學及獨立學院共有十二校、分三十餘學院、（獨立學院中之科視作學院）、一百三十餘學系、就院別論、計文學院、法學院如下、理學院七、他如農。工。醫等學院各有一二個、再就系別而論、一百三十餘學系中、計中國文學系、經濟系各十、政治系、外國文學系各九、法律系、物理系各七、史學系、哲學系、數學系各六、敎育學系、社會學系、化學系各五、生物系、心理系各四、地理系音樂系各三、此外各學系各有一二個不等、上海各大不院系重複的情形與北平相似、其他各省市、院系的重複、則較少、但因此敎育部分別令飭酌加裁併、或停止招收新生、分年結束、經平大學女子文理學院哲學敎育系的裁撤、國文史地兩系併爲文史系、商學院與法學院合併改稱法商學院、設商學系、因際貿易、工商管理、交通管理三系、自本年度起不得再招新生、北平師範大學社會系裁撤、清華大學法律系裁撤、暨南大學敎育學院取銷、原有各學系改併爲敎育學系併入文學院、法學院裁撤、原有學生轉入國立中央大學法學院肄業、河南大學社會不系停招新生、土木工程系裁撤、中國文學系與史學系合併爲文史系、法學院除經濟系外、不再招生、俟法律、政治兩系現有學生結束後、經濟系併入文學院、山西敎育學院及山西法學院均歸併於山西大學、四川大學敎育學院裁撤改爲敎育系併入文學院、安徽大學數學及物理兩系合併爲數理系、法學院裁撤、原有學生、或令轉學或酌改系、河北法商學院全部停止招生、其他各校重複院系及師資設備缺乏、無力發展的院系、均經令飭自擬裁併計盡、呈部核行、其目的在完全減少重複與適應實際需要、使各校人力財力集中、從事於特殊的充實與發展、</p>
<p>二充實設備據二十年度統計、全國專科以上學校新添設備費約六百四十萬元、二十一年度約六百二十餘萬元、最近約六百五十餘萬元、可見近來各校各年新添設備費、約均在六百四十萬元左右、不能不說是有了相當的進步、二十年度全國新添設備費六百四十萬元中、圖書費佔百分之十七、儀器。標本。機器等費佔百分之二十六、合併爲百分之四十三、其餘百分之五十七、大都爲建築修繕以及校具雜項等費、二十一年度新添設備費六百二十餘萬元中、圖書分之三一。八、最近新添設備費六百五十餘萬元中、圖書費佔百分之十九、儀器。標本。機器等費佔百分之三一。八、最近新添設備費六百五十餘萬元中、圖書佔百分之一八。八、儀器。標本。機器等費佔百分之三一。八、最近新添設備費六百五十餘萬元中、圖書費佔百分之十九、儀器。標本。機器等費佔百分之三十二、若是把三年比較一下、最近的圖書費較二十年約增加百分之二、較二十一年度約增加百分之○。二、儀器。標準。機器等費、較二十年度約增加百分之五。六、較二十一年度約增加百分之○。二、可見各校對於圖書。儀器等項設備確有相當的增加、不過這種增加、係指全體而言、個別看來、仍多未合法定標準、尤以私立者爲甚、照法令上的規定、大學設備費至少應佔經常費百分之十五、行政費不得超過百分之十、所以專科以上學校、對於行政費應力求減少、對於設備費應力求增高、敎育部除分別令飭各校對於儀器、圖書等項設備、謀確切的充實外、本年度核定私立專科以上學校補助費、設備費佔百分之八一。五、這就是特別注重設備的意思、</p>

<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>有病不服藥，常得中醫。平庸的才知，常得中人。足知多才，不爲善，就作惡，決不肯庸碌地過去。作著有利於爲善，爲著大都爲人，而作惡只顧自我，有才知的，寧願作惡。多一分才知，便多一分作惡的本領。本領好的，不見其惡，只見其善。惡被善粉飾了。所以老莊主張絕聖秦知。</p>
<p>然而老莊也是絕頂聽明的人。一部道德經，一部南華經，抉發人間世的隱秘，透澈極了。照理，罪惡應當減少。但從另一方面看來，卻又無異敎猱升木，不能減少，反而助長。這也許就是他們說了而又要想不說的苦衷罷。假如言辭換了行動，是可以成最大的奸慝的。</p>
<p>和這兩樣，則是自已現身說法，如懂得布幔的道理，而也罩上一層布幔。聰明的人，會說惜以今日我非昨日之我，舌頭一翻，搖身一變。其實也是自已揭去了布幔，又換上了一層布幔，或者簡直現了原形。</p>
<h3 id="c273">巫山 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 尹光</p>
<p>在黃昏的幕罩中，船慢慢地在巫山拋錨了。　　船客們已然踱上甲板，有的抱了煙袋，有的呵欠著，有的留心著茶房們的指點，大家都向江岸上，那城堡所在的一面，不住地縣送著好奇的探視，彷彿可以找出甚麼惹眼的建築，和熱鬧的市里一般。</p>
<p>然而，這里，映來人們眼里的，不過是一片剌目的荒涼而已。</p>
<p>那城市，就箕踞在一座不十分高大的土山頂上，低矮而且可憐。好像牠底故意蹲得高高的，並不是爲了要顯一座山城有的特點，而是讓人們來鑒賞牠的凋殘和落後。那就是說，在聯綿的擾亂中，在不良的自然條件下面，一個雖然寄託在一條重要江綫上的城鎮，是怎樣的在瀕於死滅了。</p>
<p>觀賞家們。搖頭，而且已經顯出喪氣的神情來了。他們好像一點也沒有感到甚麼興會。一個新出門模樣的青年人，瞪著眼睛，自言自語地嚷道：</p>
<p>呵喲，說了半天，就是這樣子麼？他還從鼻子里苦笑出來。</p>
<p>好多人都回轉到自已的舖位上去了。從昏濁的江面上，三數支灰褐色的劃船，在懶懶地闊浮過來。但既沒有呌賣食物的喧嚷，也聽不見一聲搶接客人的招喚。好像那些船主人的目的，本不過是想趕過來，分享一點所謂人世間的熱鬧一樣。然而因了這零零落落的點綴，江面上卻益加顯得清冷了。</p>
<p>有人上岸嗎？留在甲板上的人，無聊似的互相問詢起來。</p>
<p>後面來，後面來。小船這才比較出力地劃船輪船的船尾去。</p>
<p>不要延遲了，來找麻煩呵！獲船兵對凖各上岸的客人叮囑著。</p>
<p>當我同著一個茶役，和兩個小本煙土商人，從在一支破舊的劃船上時，夜色已經漸漸地加濃了。一種陰森的感覺包圍了我們。但是，雖然我們停泊的地方，依舊還在這漫長的峽道的中途，道陰森，卻是廣漢的荒涼的，並不帶得有山峽中應有的深沉和嚴肅。因爲從上游疾馳而來的山勢，到了這里，好像忽然地崩塌了，只留下一些土邱和小山，和一段亂石堆砌的江岸。</p>
<p>哎呀，芳房用乎上的空酒瓶指了船腔，呌道，你也出點錢補一下呢。</p>
<p>說得容易，補一下……</p>
<p>好像奇怪指責者的不識相似的，那船夫沒有說到底，便又懶懶地偏了頭，照管自已的劃板去了。</p>
<p>這是一個五十多歲的老者，沙白鬍子，面皮舊黑而多皺紋。他懶懶地揮使著他那鑲著新木的，破舊的劃板，腰肢伸屈著，半閉了眼睛，好像他底工作，倒並不是爲了吃食，而是在隨意消處他早已活壓了的時光。由於那茶役加緊的催促，不多久，船已經在拋江了。</p>
<p>老頭子，我向那現在只要照管住船的方位便行的船夫，問道，聽說神匪又繼同過麼？</p>
<p>是呀，又鬧呢。前幾天，軍隊纔開走。</p>
<p>於是那兩個煙土商人，移動了一下身體，也開始搬出自已的博識來了。就在這樣的談話當中，船彙了岸。於是，踱過一片雜著碎石的沙溺，走上那斜陸的小道，我們進到那荒涼的縣城里面去了。</p>
<p>然而說是縣城，那大小和熱鬧，其實，就拿別的區域里的塲鎮來比較，也是不相稱的。而目牠還保持著以前一切小市鎮的老樣，狹窄的街道，低矮的房舍，街路上橫著曬衣的竹竿和待劈的柴料。一個小孩子，一支手提著褲腰，一支手拿了一根籐鞭似的縴繩，哭嚷著，向幾支狂跑著的小豬奔過去了。</p>
<p>在幾家茶舖的階沿上，都有著熬製煙土的爐灶和設備。那兩個煙土商，正正經經地，去講自已的生意去了，茶房向一家暗洞似的簷下隱沒。而我，那時候已經十分灰䫋的我，卻獨自地在那街市上巡行著，直到在城門口集齊了我的同伴，那煙土商和茶房。</p>
<p>我們又踏上那陡斜的歸路了，但我依舊被一種不寧靜的心緒壓迫著。</p>
<p>一張先生，你把頭仰起看看！那茶房忽而用嘻笑的口調招呼我道，同時打開了他的電捧。</p>
<p>隨着那光線的指示，我向路側的電捍頂上望去了：那上面掛著三個已經失掉了血色的可怕的東西。但我並沒有如同伴們所希望的張惶。凝視了一忽，我仍舊回復了我自已的思路。</p>
<p>在劃子蠱攏輪船的時候，我們碰到了護船兵士的麻煩。</p>
<p>這是一九三一年秋天的事，第二天一早，船便進向那兩岸絕璧的巫峽了。</p>
<h3 id="c274">忠厚老實人 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 碧冰</p>
<p>洛夫是一個忠厚老實的人，這至少在他自已，是這麼自信的。雖然洛夫居住上海，是已經有了八九年，雖然除了上海以外，洛夫也曾跑過香港，澳門，天津，北平，漢口，青島，濟南，南京，九江等等的中國區域範團以內的商埠，雖然洛夫也曾經過許多方式不同的職業，如敎員，投稿者，軍隊中政治工作，鐵路上稽查等等之類，井且洛夫還曾經過各種不同方式的生活，如開十二三塊錢一間的房間，以及窮到無立椎之地之類，但，說來也許還沒有人相信。洛夫到現在，還可以說是一個忠厚老實的人。</p>
<p>世故人情，在洛夫自已，是以爲瞭解得非常深刻的，善惡智愚，無論相交時日的長短，洛夫都自以爲能夠判斷得明白：可是偏偏有許多人。認洛夫不瞭解世故人情，把他當作一個易於欺侮的人。而洛夫也便真的一次二次三次……被欺侮，玩弄，以增加他的閱歷。</p>
<p>這人是沒有希望的，他始終是打流窮。一點做人的法則都不知道。許多的人，將洛夫欺侮，玩弄了，反而要轉過頭來，這麼似乎懷著好意的來責備他。</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>洛夫受了責備，不能說出半句反駁的話來，因爲現在的社會，……尤其是上海或者其他都市，根本就不需要忠厚老實的人。忠厚老實的人，根本就不能在這種社會立足。洛夫受了責備，當然除了忍受及埋怨自已以外，是不能反駁他人了。</p>
<p>洛夫有時因爲被玩弄，欺侮所賜予的創痕太深了，敎訓太多了，也很想振作振作一下，做一個人，……自然是現代的人。和現代社會相適應的人，能說盧僞，欺騙的括的人，這麼樣，或者也可以在這個社會上立足。</p>
<p>喂！你今天到廣東去嗎？</p>
<p>不！我明天上漢口。</p>
<p>聽說你近來和黃君很接近。想你在不久之將來。也可以得意了。</p>
<p>黃君我不認識。這個人非常會用手段的，你們千萬不嬰上他的當。</p>
<p>這麼明知其是，而偏作不是的回答，在他人，許以爲洛夫真的善於做人了，能夠說虛僞欺騙的話了。所以心中也隱墜地對洛夫表示欽偑。以爲需子可敎也。然而，說來只有上帝才相信，當洛夫因刺激太深，而故意的說這些明知其是，而偏作不是的回答時，洛夫的內心痛苦難堪，是比較以赤膽忠誠待人，結果只有被他人以虛僞欺騙手段方法玩弄而受到的劇烈創傷還要超過若干倍數，因爲這，不但是欺騙了他人，也許還欺騙了自已，我做什麼事，對人說什麼話，何必要虛僞欺騙！這麼一般著想，也許洛夫要哭起來，跪在那位聽過洛夫盧僞欺騙的話的人面前，求他怒宥。</p>
<p>這是什麼一回事，神經病！</p>
<p>然而他人，畢竟是他人。他人聽了洛夫的虛僞欺騙的話，也許還不能知覺得到，認爲是真的以赤膽忠誠待人，也許知覺到，明知是假話，而欽偑洛夫做人乎段的痛明，但現在，等候洛夫說真話，而坦白的自已檢舉，悔過，反而來菲薄他的認爲洛夫的舉動是不近人情，結果，洛夫忠誠的悔過。反而被他人賤視。</p>
<p>這人真的沒有希望了，他還是自殺的好。</p>
<p>當面雖然沒有人這麼說，但背地里，是有人這種主張的，以後若和洛夫見面時，他人便露出輕視的容貌，或者敬而遠之了。</p>
<p>因此，洛夫所得的世故人情的經騐，雖然豐富，但畢竟無所應用，若應用反只有弄巧成拙，破壞了自身忠厚老實人的名節，這種理由根據，使洛夫以後待人，連半句謊話都不敢說，即偶然說錯了一二句話，也不得不急急的更正，恐怕他人又認爲自已在玩弄虛玄。</p>
<p>忠厚老實人，愈加名副其實的表現出他的忠厚老實。</p>
<p>因之洛夫所交的朋友，也只有小孩子，或者初步世故的少年人，因爲這些人，也和洛夫一樣是以忠厚老實待人，物以類聚，彼此才能契合。然而，等候那些小孩子或者少年人，長大了，懂得世故了，也會以虛僞欺騙待人了，則那時的洛夫，又被那些小孩子或者少年人所玩弄欺侮，以及輕視，洛夫又會和這些昔日視爲小孩子少年人的青年紳士，感情疏隔起來。於是，與他相交的又改一些新的小孩子少年人。可是未來的時日一到來，那些第二批（？）的小孩子少年人成了青年紳士，懂得世故人情之後，洛夫又只有和第三批（？）小孩子少年人相處了。這麼樣一個公式，走馬換將術的更遞，現在計算起來，已有了八九年的時日，在這些時日中，已經有了第五批（？）小孩子和少年人，成了當今社會的青年紳士，然而洛夫還是不長進，洛夫現在，只有和第六批小孩子和少年人相處。</p>
<p>洛夫永遠不能對於人生社會中最緊要的功課！世故人情，有所體騐，他將負著這賜與舖急厚老實人的諢名，一直到他的生命終了爲止了。</p>

<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>平坦地，堅實地，舖著一層柏油。兩旁沒有樹木，沒有太高的，壯麗的房子。全是兩層或是三層的建築，而且並不很整齊：有的已經古舊了，有的卻是近代的建築物。但是你大概可以知道，支那人是永遠愛在舊店鋪里做他們的生意的。</p>
<p>朝東的趁著太陽還沒有起來的時候，就把白布蓬撐了起來，防著一個鐘頭以後那熱帶的太陽的蒸曬。在布面上，用著兩種甚至三種文字塗著店名：漢字和拉丁字擺在一塊兒是有怎樣的不同，你可以想像得到。</p>
<p>漸漸地，街上的人多了起來，車子也多了起來。人是裑雜不過的：如果你站在那馬來警察所站的待心瞧那麼二三十分鐘，展列在你的面前的就有如下各種不同的人類：</p>
<p>黃臉的支那人日本人。藍眼珠子的德國人，荷蘭人，英國人，葡萄牙人，美國人……。黑色的菲洲人，吉寧人，……（不準備你的人種學知識是不會分得清的。）</p>
<p>汽車里，坐著那些靠著歐洲大戰，由樹膠園而暴發了的人的子孫：回想到那些好往日，他們都會搖著腦袋太息。馬車像是這里的特殊存在物似地，很引起一些新來的人的好奇心，不轉睛地對著發動了四蹄往前奔跑的馬和車夫的身上瞧。腳踏車成羣結隊地來往著：上面坐的有時候你看去是妙齡的女人。她們駕車的純熟自然，誰都得感到驚異的　吧？</p>
<p>措著書包往學堂走的小學生，堆著笑臉，嘩啦地侭朝前衝，你走在他們的前面麼，一會兒他們便趕過你了。</p>
<p>生長在南洋的孩子總是活潑可受的。好動的，張勁的性格敎他們每天都得打一次架。你也許奇怪到馬來警察身上去：爲什麼看見孩子們打架而不加干涉呢？可是，你且等它十來分鐘，打輸了的會很貼服地跟著人走著他們的路。</p>
<p>推著Lce.crtam和檸樣水的吉寧人的小車子也在街上出現了，鈴聲叮叮地響著。有的人不管口渴不渴扔下三五個銅子就有一杯甜味的冰水可喝下去。吉寧人有著一臉的鬍髭，穿著紗緩緩地推著，打從那邊拐彎走了。</p>

<p>— 爲何</p>
<p>看我暹疑不決的挑選不成，他又幫我翻來翻去的翻了半天。接著連乎也不烘，連靴子也不脫的，就幫我唐墨，裁紙，因爲怕紙裁錯，他小小心心的量了又量，摺了又摺，紙裁好了他又用手指在上面劃指紋，用母親的擦面粉在上面打著叉叉，口里不住的說：</p>
<p>要寫得勻凈，把位置配好，對子尤其要寫得一行筆直的，切忌寫得顛顛倒倒，歪歪曲曲……</p>
<p>他臉上顯著嚴肅的光鄉，皺皮一實一鬆的，不住的變著形相，嘴唇也彷彿因著過度興奮的剌激，顯出歪曲的樣子。他一面用那雙桔瘦的手，緊鉗著他特地輞來的新墨，一面兩雙巤眼在那本包著黑封套的百科全書上溜著，口一啟一閉，似乎在低聲吟哦。</p>
<p>我也買來了一枝新羊毫，是真正的斗方筆，這全是爲了張大爺的面子！</p>
<p>一切都佈置停當，以後，像開什麼展覧會似的，父親又去請了幾位鄰近的紳士來，看著我寫。這些人全是村里一等人物，鐵營欺詐，無惡不作。他們終年不作一點正事，卻都穿得講究吃得講究，不但卑鄙齷齪，而且驕傲得要命。我一向是㬇不上眼這些仁史的，正在父親卻請他們來看我寫字，像監考一樣，因此我對他們的惡感愈其高增了。</p>
<p>我聽到這些彷佛什麼都懂的，不要臉的寄生蟲，在不絕地讚美我：</p>
<p>恭喜恭喜，你生了這樣一個兒子，真是幸福極了！</p>
<p>有幾個卻掩飾不住的，用羨慕而且妒嫉的口吻說：</p>
<p>面子呀！張大爺賞的面子，還有什麼話講？</p>

<p>— ＨＹ</p>
<p>東三省的特產，首屆一指的要算是大豆了。</p>
<p>隨著東北被佔，大豆也淪入日本帝國主義產業部門之內。這也算不了什麼，十地，人民已都屬了人家，自然無法收回這類特產。</p>
<p>不過，近日報載日德締結秘密恊定，而這恊定的內容，據哈瓦斯社倫敦電訊，說是由日本每年供給德國一百萬噸大豆，用以交換德國的化學品，炸藥，機關槍，飛機等項殺人武器。這實在是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>日本和德國這項恊定，不論這通電訊的播發，是出於德國的對頭冤家法國的通訊社，也許這是別有作用，但我們可以拋除這一點不談，單談恊定的成立，我們認爲確有可能。何況，如果用我們一句舊話無風不起浪來說，這電訊總還有幾分是可靠的。</p>
<p>關於恊定完成後的重要性，筆者不願多說，讓我們的國際政治專家去寫些評論罷，筆者在這里要說的話，是爲我們的特產喊一聲冤。</p>
<p>如其我們的東北不失掉，我們不是也可以用大豆和德國（或是別國）換些武器麼？固然，我們不贊成殺人，要反對戰爭的，但是最低限度總可以用到自衛上。請問日本從什麼地方得來的大豆，是他國里的特產品？不是的，就是用了我們東北民衆血汁耕種出來的大豆！這是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>還記得近兩年來，東北農產品的狂跌，跌得銷路全無。一般農民只有把產品存在家里藏著。大豆是東北農產品中主要部門，農民受害更甚。我們試問這是受到什麼影響？就是受了日本帝國主義有計劃的迫害。現在，我們可以替東北農民道一聲喜，爲的存藏每家的大豆可以賣出，但是日本帝國主義在這種情形下的低價收買，當真發了一筆大財。</p>
<p>說來說去吃虧的總是我們自已。人家用我們的東西，換得來武器，將來還要來殺戮我們，這是多麼說不出口的事情！</p>
<p>所以，筆者因此要們的大豆喊一聲冤：冤哉，我們的大豆。</p>
<h3 id="c302">回憶 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 蕙人</p>
<p>在你感到身處寂寞或無聊的當兒，例如在秋風蕭瑟，淫雨紛飛，或者秋夜望著明月，聽著秋蟲悲鳴，獨自烯著枝捲煙，靜坐在室內清閑的時候，有意識的或無意識的會翻出些藏在深處的回憶。不論是歡樂的或悲哀的，總會刺激著頭腦，使你感覺到這一回憶的來到，是多少的帶來了一些苦悶：像趙景深先生在人間世第九期上也用著傷威的筆調這樣地寫著：不可復回的過去呵，我寂寞，我要燒掉我的書和我的書桌，我要擲去我的筆……</p>
<p>所謂苦悶之嘆者，在文人的眼里具體點說就是牢騷。在這牢騷中所勾引出來的，雖有著使人不堪回首的印象，或者平淡得簡直沒有回憶之價值，但這沒有價值的回憶到了現在卻也有其特殊的風味，像每一個事實的過去在自已生命史上，佔了值得光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>就以一個人來說，在青年時，感覺到兒童時代的生活比現在要好得許多—但是或許在兒童時代也並未感覺到有什麼滿足的地方—但這些早已在腦間消失，所意識到的全是些兒童時的天真可愛，於是在青年時代，天真的搜索便成了一個回憶的題材：假使在老年時代，那麼青年時代又成爲了回憶了對象：假使至將要入木時，那麼連老年時候的一刻靜穆生活也覺得有留戀。</p>
<p>因爲身子一靜下來的時候，腦子就回到回溯里，所以對於自已所處身的現在很少機會去體騐它：但奇怪的，就是不去注意的現在會在將來又成爲值得去思戀的一段。</p>
<p>對於現實的不滿，是由於過去回憶奪所呈現出來的而對照著來的，但到底是怎樣的不滿，卻沒有加以具體的體騐，祗不過感覺到過去是有點可愛，而現在是苦悶，痛苦的，不問從前是怎樣的可愛，現在又是怎樣的痛苦。所以有人說：人是盲目的愛著，盲目的恨著。但是盲目的愛恨民消費了不少的時間。</p>
<h3 id="c303">週年 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 夢瀾</p>
<p>媽臨終時的那種痛苦掙扎的情狀，還透新鮮的印在我腦膜上，像昨天的事似的，不，像上一個鐘頭里的事似的。可是，現在是整整的一年啦。</p>
<p>一年啦，那太快的光陰呵！</p>
<p>媽在生前，我對她是沒有好感的，直到臨終一面擬著電報告訴姊姊的時候，還是像替別人家寫便條擬的，滑有一些感想，更沒有所謂悲哀。那沒有好感的理由，大概是因爲母親過度的愛護，以致變成了過度的嘮叨，於是在任性的倔強的孩子的心中，便成爲討厭了。譬如少穿了一件衣服，便會說上一個鐘頭，而我是會把善意視作敵意的，以爲這麼大了，還老是嚕蘇著吃穿。次數一多，便不問理由的聽見母親嘮叨，便一溜煙的走開。這樣，是重重的傷了慈母的心。</p>
<p>此外，便是新舊思想的衡突，而我又是不懂小節的：在舊一代的人以爲應該盡禮的地方，我往往一笑視之。記得有一次，—那是母親抱恨終身的一次呵，我深深的紀錄，—從鄉間回來，回爲舟車上過度的勞頓，到家又天還不曾亮，於是便沒有母親房里去請安，便回到自已房里睡了，可是，這自已不經意的過失，在媽的心目中，是以爲掉了娘了，使她整整不樂了好幾天，直到病重的時候，還不時的把這件事提起。當時，倔強的任性的我以爲媽不該這樣的求全責備，心里也感到幾分不快，可是，又誰料這小小的事件居然使媽抱恨終身的呢？到現在，還有誰肯嘮叨的地牽住了手問冷問暖？還有誰怪我祗吃了一碗飯便放下了筷呢？</p>
<p>人家的悲哀是會眼著時日消失去了的，而我，跟了時日的增長，增長了我的悲思。</p>
<p>媽在時，家庭里是有種說不出的融洽的樂趣的，而現在，媽死了剛一年，家庭的融洽的空氣在那里？這倔強的任性的孩子，又爲了忍不住種種刺激，做了家庭的叛徒，到社會來困苦地和社會搏門了，媽，要是你在世的話，你肯允許你的孩子過著這樣艱難的生活嗎？媽，要是你有靈的話，在這週年祭里，你看一看現在家庭里的景象，你一家要放心痛哭的呢？可是，現在是，再見不到媽清瘦的臉上流著凄苦的淚了。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>再看看爸吧，爸的臉上是比一年前瘦了多少？可是，爸的苦衷雖然是我知道的，爸的行爲我卻不能原諒，媽，你該知道你的倔強的孩子甘願獨自個兒到社會去搏門的苦衷吧？</p>
<p>媽，你的死，我沒有流過涙，但是，在你週年祭的時候，你的倔強的孩子可流起涙來了，爲了思念你過去對我無徹不至的慈愛，更爲了你的偉大的慈愛被我看作敵意，媽，到現在，我雖然想不流涙也是不可能的了。</p>
<p>祗是流涙是沒用的，我知道。以後，我祗有用加倍的努力來報答你的慈愛吧。嗎！</p>

<p>— 阿爾</p>
<p>有些文人說：三分病，七分閒，小病尤有另一番情緻。不過，在我呢？每每逢到精神不大好的時候，總是十分苦惱的。既不能寫文章，亦難以幹別的工作。祗是整日夜的不安著。所以我對於文人們這些經騐之談，就未免有點疑惑。不過生活的不安，誰又有閒情管到這些呢？但是我終於給困倒了，也生了所謂病。沒有病我已經有點擔心，病了怎樣呢？呼什麼呀？不病已經難以支持，如果真的病下去，那可更沒有辦法了。足足就秋風起兮我受了涼！發了小寒熱。昏糊的倒在床上。這時候，冷冷靜靜的亭子間內，就除自已的呻吟以外，再也聽不見別的聲音了。不只沒有七分閒倒有十二萬分苦惱。病本身的痛苦倒可以忍受過去。然而，生活呌誰去掙扎，去擔負呢？不要說：病了不能自已起來尋飯吃，而也吃不下，滑有人和錢給你伏侍，沖牛奶拿開水給你喝。就單生活的壓迫就夠迫得病上加病呵。縱到了漸漸的不醫而自好了些，可是七分閒仍是沒有，只增重了心頭的苦惱！房租，飯錢，和虛弱的身體怎辦呢？三分病沒有了，該是心緒較佳吧！實則愈來愈不妙，更愁著衣食住了！勉強執筆寫文章吧，換點稿費來救濟，可以一時代替了七分閒吧！不過，手軟頭腦虛昏不清，想下去頭更痛，那麼，只好暗呌怎樣才好呢？就倒下床。床再也不出閒情了。就是自家極力想避免苦惱。所謂好休養，不要多思慮。但這怎能避免？這是要在一定的條件底下，才能休養和避免的。不然，就要有可以不需要衣食住的本領才行。或者自已有了一點存欵之類。所以三分病七分閒之流，是不可同日而語的先生們呢！</p>

<h3 id="c306">提琴啞了 <a href="#c306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— 吳飛</p>
<p>提琴啞了！真的，我至少要有一個星期沒有聽到這悠揚的，懷楚的提琴聲了！</p>
<p>在一個星期之前，當我每天侵晨挾著一本書，走向公園里去的時候，必須要經過一條淺陋的衖堂，和一段曲折的短程，就在這術口一座小洋房里，每天總有那末一節節，一聲聲的悠揚的提琴聲送出，蕩漾在這晨光熹微的空氣里。我雖是五點半便要經過那里，但彷佛這提琴聲，卻比我更早：所以當我每天照例地走到那衖口小洋房附近的時候，使聽得那鏗鏘鏘的音調由這座小洋房里飄出，徐徐地飄出。</p>
<p>不知怎的，我總是那末愛聽這聲音的：因此，每當經過那里，必要在那座小洋房前徘徊半響，方肯悻悻然的離去。有時這琴聲不終，我甚至也不願離閒，寧可公園里也不去，書也不想看，實在的，這是那音調太夠逗人了！那末如怨如慕，那末似泣似訴的。</p>
<p>那座小洋房雖不甚大，也不很高，但倒十分精緻：它是傍著河濱築的。一邊是河，一面是花園，空氣極好，風景亦佳，長在這里的人，當然是要有福氣的。但那㤰揚的提琴聲，不知是從伊誰的手指上吐出來的？是男主人吧？不，照這曼妙音調里揣測，那一筆是個女主人，也許是獨少女，一定的，一定的。</p>
<p>我爲了要想騙除這個好奇的疑竇，於是每天留意這音調是從那一個窗口里發出的。</p>
<p>有一天，我照例的五時半起身，也照例的挾了書走向公園的路上去：走到那小洋房前，那悠揚的，悽楚的音波又在週遭蕩漾了，並且還夾著一種鶯喉似的歌聲，這分明是一個少女的歌聲。我便倚在河濱邊的鐵欄上望上去，望上去，那個壓在我心頭好久的奇蹟，終於是給我發現了：一個美麗少女的債影，早已攝進了我的眼珠子。</p>
<p>可不是麼？那是一個少女，美麗的少女。我這樣驚奇的想。</p>
<p>她穿著一件蜜色薄紬的晨裝，領上袖口都綴著柔軟潔白的翎毛，微曲的髪兒有些頭動。金黃色的陽光射在她臉上，把她襯托得更其嫵媚了。這是誰家的姑㛄呵！我不禁對她癡癡望著。</p>
<p>從此，我腦海里空虛的一角，又填進了這一個天真活潑的少女玉影。於是每天早晨，比任何工課還要緊的，要去瞻仰一回她的芳容，和聆一下那提琴聲音。</p>
<p>這樣幾個月以來，並沒有一次使我失望過：不過其中也有過二次使我失望的。一次是三天，一次是一天：原來三天是她上杭州去的，一天是因爲她有些頭痛，所以沒有來彈。但是我祝福她，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　至一時一刻。</p>
<p>可是事情太不幸了！她終於在今年秋天——就是一星期之前，因患白喉而在xx醫院里香消玉殞了！從此玉人何處，提琴聲是永遠也聽不到了！</p>
<p>提琴的主人死了！提琴啞了！現在我每天走到這里，總要那樣低低地喊著，然而終於使我彷彿似失掉了一顆心般的悲痛，現在我敬向她靈前致著萬分的哀悼！</p>

<h3 id="c312">十年來上海租界建築投資之一斑 <a href="#c312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>吾人試巡親上海公共租界及法租界一週，其對於此星羅棋佈之各式各種建築，必將驚心觸目，而感歎不止矣，究竟是兩租界中建築物之成績，能有幾何，前週大陸報曾揭有，英法兩租界中，十年來之建築額數，列表照譯，刋布如左：</p>
<p>其中以民國十九年份之建築額爲最高，計公共租界方面單獨建有建築物八千八百三十六座，值價六千五百萬元之鉅，蓋是時方值，國民軍奠定南京，時局平靖，昇平有望之象也，其後至民二十一年度，因上海感受一二八之淞滬大戰，於是建築業亦以大降，投資額數，僅及二千五百餘萬，尚不及民十九年之半數也。然法租界方面，因滬戰受驚較淺，故降低程度不過三分之一左右，斯則均能自上表中明白看出者也。然曾幾何時，而本年度之建築投資總額，則又有飛黃騰達，蓬勃上漲之勢矣，截止本年九月份爲止，公共租界及法租界之總額已達四千一百餘萬元之數量，其實可驚。再試以共租界，去年之紀錄，將其資額及建築分類列舉如下，藉觀本埠建築物建築趨勢之一班，計民二十二年份公共租界建築總資額爲三千五百四十六萬三千七百四十元正，建築物凡五千一百三十餘所，其中包有中國普通民房三千五百四十五年，洋式住宅二百五十七所，公寓十三所，寫字間大廈十三所，商店二百零四所，戲院四所，學校七所，工廠二十七所，工業築物六十三所，堆棧二十所，倉庫九十八所，其餘建築物八百七十九所，而法租界及本年兩界所有建築物之分配，亦興之大概相似云。</p>
<p>查上海建築事業之所以能發達如是，考其原由，當由於上海中外銀行及信託公司，保險公司將所有全國資金，自農村中吸收而來，日增無已，而彼輩之握此巨欵者，鑒於公債，標金，紗布交易之不穩定，除投資於地產建築外，更無他法，故上海之建築事業如是發達，爲農村經濟破產，都市畸形發展中之必然趨勢，且以地價高貴，故建築物之日趨於高升層次，更有必然之理矣。</p>

<p>— 欽</p>
<p>誰也不能反對建築可以代表一時代的文化這一句話，因爲建築真是一部很好的記在石上的歷史。</p>
<p>費克脫歐果（Ｖlctot　　Hugo）說：在世界六千年以前，建築是不過一本人類偉大的紀事冊。從這上面，不僅有宗敎上的記號，並且不家人類思想的湧現，都一張一頁地包藏在里面。</p>
<p>古代的建築很明白地顯示給我們當時人類的生活習慣，日常的工作，以及他們的信仰，難難，和恐懼等。因爲那時的人民，都不能像我們現在一樣的能寫能讀，就是在中世紀的時候，人們能看書的還是非常之少，所以他們不得不把他們的行爲與思想紀在木頭和石塊上，遣留下來，成爲一點供我們今天研究古代文化的資料。</p>
<p>所以一個國家的建築，就可以反射出其一國的思想與創造力。我們所看見的那些各式各樣的房屋，決不是無緣無故的建造起來的，他們都代表了一個時代內文化進步的程度。雖然其中的建造法，有許多很笨拙的，也有些很巧妙的，可是最後的意義，還是值得我們去研究一下的。</p>
<p>（甲）尼羅河邊的建築</p>
<p>在西曆耶蘇降生前四千年的時候，尼羅河邊的人民已經是很開通的了。他們都居在城市里面，會得做許多藝術上的精巧的工作。所以在埃及，我們發見了建築的發源地。那里的偉大的金字塔，獨身人面的司緋克思Ｓpinx，還有許許多多的魏峨的廟字和墳墓，都現示著這神秘古國的精華，同時就告訴我們埃及人民的生活和特點。</p>
<p>在埃及地方一共有七十五個大的金字塔，牠們的大小，堅固，和簡單，就代表了埃及人民的思想與毅力。其中最大的一個，底邊每邊就有七千七百四十六尺之長，建造起來的磚頭，至少須有三百三十萬以上。這樣巨大的數目，也許你一時不容易想像到，那末讓我來講一個比喻來給你聽。假使我們把這些磚頭拆下來造一道很堅固的城牆的話，其長度可以環繞法國全國一周！</p>
<p>這些巍大的金字塔，並非是宗教上的建築，好像我國佛敎的寶塔一樣，牠們乃是古代埃及國王的填墓。因爲這些國王們深怕他們死了之後，有人會來弄壞他們的屍身，還有那許多陪葬的無價的寶物會被人盜去，所以他們建造了這巨大堅固的墳墓，以爲是毫無危險，可以永保千秋了。那知他們的屍身還是一樣的還給了自然，連一根骨頭也不會留到現在，所剩的倒是那五千多年來萬刦不壞的金字塔，留住了他們身後百世的光榮。</p>
<p>其次是埃及地方的華貴的古廟。牠們也是一般的顯示著簡單堅固的結構，其中雖然有許多精美的雕刻，但在構造方面祗賴著粗直的石柱，石板，和楣石之類。廟字里面是非常之黑暗與怪悖。禮拜的人們，須經過一帶都是廊柱的天井，然後到了一個黯黯的大殿上，那里的中間就供奉著埃及宗敎的神像。他們也是差不多的黯朦和神秘，四周環繞著無數的符咒，法語，與奇怪的儀式，永久不會見一次天日的。</p>
<p>卡那克Ｋarnak地方的一座大廟，名Ａmmon，是其中最崛出的。牠的形式和我們現在的大敎堂很像，不過牠的工程的完畢卻經過了好幾百年。在牠的四周墻壁上的圖畫上，我們可以看出當時一段艱苦的經過。這廟大約是在耶穌降生前二千四百年問起造的，在幾百年之後，再增添了一個有很多偉大的廊柱圖繞著的庭院，在一千三百五十年時，才造成了那巍大的正堂。這恐怕要算是空前未有的大建築。正堂的容積，異常廣大，長達三百四十尺，寛約一百七十尺，其屋頂是用一百三十四根粗大的柱子支住著。雄壯與美麗，得未曾有。</p>
<p>但是這樣偉大的建築，若在別一個時代，那是一定不會成功的。因爲這時候，奴隸之制盛行，國家把俘虜驅逐著去做無限的苦工。我們可以從那直立的石柱上，想到那時候數千萬在鞭笞下工作的人民，用一個小小的鑿子丁丁地鑿著巨大花岡石塊的情形。我們又彷彿聽到那些可憐的動物的呼聲，當他們拖了這樣一個笨重的石柱，經過了五百里長乾枯的沙漠的時候。所以埃及的建築，在牠們簡單與堅固的形狀上，雖然稱得起，雄峨一二，但這上面卻留家著奴隸制度的痕跡，內中包含著無限恐怖之心。這恐怖的思想，一方面在國王身上是怕他身後的不安：還有一方面是勞工的人役怕那皮鞭的施處加到自已的身上來。</p>

<h3 id="c315">工廠烟囱建築法 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>重要工業建築之一</p>
<p>隨便什麼的發力廠，都需要適當量的空氣引入鍋爐，以助燃燒，這種適當量空氣的調節，就非利用烟囱不可，所以烟囱的重要，已爲一般工程師所公認，同時牠的高度，材料和一切的建築法，工程師已審慎地研究而得有相當的成績，烟囱的直徑不能超過牠高度百分之八，牠的高度有時也隨著煤的種類或別種燃料而定，如下表：</p>
<p>燃料　　　　　　烟囱高度（尺）</p>
<p>草或木料　　　　　　　三五</p>
<p>煙煤塊　　　　　　　一○○</p>
<p>普通煤粒　　　　　　一○○</p>
<p>普通煙煤　　　　　　一一五</p>
<p>小煤塊或白煤　　　　一二五</p>
<p>白煤細立　　　　　　一五○</p>
<p>建造烟囱之材料頗多，如磚，瓦，水泥，鋼等茲分述如後：</p>
<p>一磚烟囱——用磚建造烟囱，大概分二部建造，即外圈與內圈是，常嵌避火磚以堅固牠，外圈內圈的中間，常留一空氣地位，這樣一來，內圈就可以自由地熱漲冷縮，磚砌的烟囱建造很貴，牠的生命有四十到五十年。</p>
<p>二瓦烟囱——瓦烟囱是用空心瓦建築而成，牠是沒有避火磚的夾里，非常的輕，且造價很廉，不過沒有磚建的堅固。</p>
<p>三水泥烟囱——再要堅固而昻貴的莫若水泥烟囱了，，牠是完全純塊的水泥澆成，沒有接簡，質輕，和節省地位，都是牠的特點，牠最適合於大規模的工廠，如其建築得好，牠的生命可以延至無窮，但是小規模的工廠，是不需要的。</p>
<p>四鋼烟囱——普通中下資本的工廠，都建造比較價廉的鋼烟囱，牠是用鍋爐鍋板現拆創成，牠是釘住在堅很的支持物上（用極大的螺絲釘）。</p>
<p>這種支持物必須有足夠的堅固，以免損折之虞烟囱這種鋼烟囱的內部當用避火磚做夾里，直砌到頂，所以非常的重，其外表常用油漆塗抹以防鋼在空氣中銹蝕，因煤煙中含有少量酸性（普通稀硫酸），對於鋼的侵蝕作用很利害，所以鋼烟囱的生命，不過二十至三十年，對於小資本廠家，是很適合的。</p>
<h3 id="c316">戲院建築論（上） <a href="#c316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>時代在不停的前進。建築術也在跟著時代而向前跑。那麼無疑的戲院的建築。當然也在疾速的進化之中。單在上海的都市中看來。十幾年前的戲院。和最近的戲院。相形之下。不但在形式上。就是在建築上。相去也不可以道里呢。因此我們建築一所戲院。如果要希望其適於時代。那麼在建築上。在設備上。都應加以注意。而且爲了環境的不同。地段的不同。同樣是一所戲院。適於建築在甲地的。卻未必就適於建築在乙地。而下面所說的。不過是些建築戲院的普通問題呢。</p>
<p>（一）形式　建造一所戲院。形式問題。當然非常重要。不拘規模的大小。一所戲院。在形式上。最低的限度。要在華麗中不帶一些庸谷的色彩。換句話說。要合於藝術化。現代化的條件。使觀衆走到戲院的門口。對於這戲院的建築。立刻會發生一種美感。甚至不想進去的人。爲了誘力的吸引也想進去一看內部的式樣。</p>
<p>（二）舞臺　一所戲院。除了每天在映著影片之外。爲了有時或許要表演遊藝。歌舞等等。銀幕的下面。必得要建造舞臺。通常舞臺和銀幕。是完全在同一個焦點的。但我們對於舞臺的設置。在形式方面。不宜過大。又不能過小。要酌乎其中。不宜過大。又不能過小。要酌乎其中。而且重要的一點。更在使舞臺上空閒地位。每個戲院里的觀衆都能完全看見。</p>
<p>（三）座位　在戲院里。座位問題。也非常重要。座位第一要寛暢。使得觀衆坐在里面。覺得非常舒服。而座位的配置。和舞臺更有密切的關係。非得要使每個座位上的觀衆。視綫能直達銀幕或舞臺。雖是有的戲院。非成彎月形不可。但建造的得法。會使坐在側邊的觀衆。望到銀幕或舞臺上去。完全和居中的相同。不覺得自已是坐在側里。</p>
<p>（四）飾漆　戲院的外面。所飾漆的顏色。當然要美化。在偉大中寓有壯麗雅緻的色彩。而在戲院的里面。各種顏色的支配。尤應得當。牆璧。天花板。圓柱。椅子。舞臺。如果是一色的。似乎太單調。但顏色多而太鮮艷。又覺庸俗。支配得要合宜。在天花和牆璧上。雪白和腥紅。早已成爲過去的顏色。現在大概都用藍黃白等相調和的顏色了。</p>
<p>（五）燈光　以前我們走進一所戲院。每每看見燈光很多。照耀得如同白日。其實這種方法。完全是錯誤的。燈光過分的強了之後。容易使觀衆目力受損。尤其是在電影未映之前。滿室通明。開映之後。完全黑暗。一暗一亮。最容易使人目力受損。因此。現在新建的戲院。每把電燈夾在天花或牆璧里。或是用反射光使燈光不致過亮。更不會和觀衆的視綫直射。</p>
<p>（六）門口　一所戲院的進門的地方。前面的馬路要寛闊。而出進要便利。假如逼所戲院。所處的地位。有兩面以上是靠馬路的。那麼最好有兩處以上的門口。這樣出進和買票。便非常便利。就一班完了。一班開始。兩班的觀衆。同時在出進的時候。也不會感到擠軋。而且有了兩處以上的賣票處。觀衆在買票時。也免得擁擠了。</p>

<p>Nanjing - The Central Government held its 154th Memorial Week at 9 AM on the 29th. Those present included Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Wu Jingheng, Chu Minyi, Ming Jiayan, Li Ciwen, Zeng Zhongming, Zheng Zhannan, Xiao Jishan, Gu Zhengchou, and all staff members, totaling approximately 600 people. Wang Zhaoming chaired the meeting and reported on the reasons for the postponement of the Fifth National Congress, stating briefly that the Central Standing Committee had delegated him to attend the meeting today to report on the work of the past week. The most important thing was the postponement of the Fifth National Congress, which was decided by the Central Standing Committee on the same day. The reasons for the postponement are evident in the telegram from Chairman Chiang to the Central Government, as well as the telegrams from the Central Committee members responsible for bandit suppression, and the telegrams from the Party Headquarters in various provinces and cities. Comrades, I believe, have already understood this and need not elaborate. According to Article 27 of the Party Constitution, the Central Executive Committee may announce a postponement of the convocation of the National Congress when it deems it necessary, but it shall not exceed one year. The Fourth National Congress was held in the winter of the 20th year of the Republic, so the Fifth National Congress should have been convened in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic. Last year, at the request of the Central Committee members stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi, the Central Committee announced a one-year postponement based on Article 27. In legal terms, it cannot be extended again. However, according to past practice, the Second National Congress was held in the 15th year of the Republic. According to the regulations at that time, the Congress was held once a year, so the Third National Congress should have been convened in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic. However, since July of the 15th year, the National Revolutionary Army had pledged to launch the Northern Expedition, and victories were frequent. The 16th and 17th years were the time when the Northern Expeditionary military forces were most developed and ultimately successful. Military operations cannot be relaxed for a moment. As a result, the Third National Congress was postponed until the 18th year before it was convened, with a postponement period of up to two years. Now, the military operations to suppress the bandits are progressing step by step, and it is precisely the time when the mountain has been built to nine levels and only one basket remains to be completed. Moreover, the Central Committee members of our Party who are responsible for the bandit suppression work in the north, such as Yuan Zhu, in the west, such as Zhang Qun and He Chengjun, and in the south, such as Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Zi Chongxi, Li Yangjing, and Miao Peinan, as well as the delegates elected by the Party Headquarters of various armies, are all limited by circumstances and cannot come to participate. The comrades and comrades of the Party Headquarters in various provinces and cities have taken this into consideration, so they jointly requested the Central Committee to postpone it again. Overdue postponement is indeed not appropriate in legal terms, but according to past practice, there are cases where it is necessary to meet the needs of the facts and alleviate the legal difficulties. The Third National Congress was postponed because the Northern Expeditionary military operations could not be relaxed for a moment. Now the progress of the bandit suppression is similar to the situation of the Northern Expedition at that time, and the degree of importance is also equal. Therefore, it is not impossible to use the previous example to alleviate the legal difficulties. Last Thursday, the Central Committee decided to postpone the Fifth National Congress and also decided to convene the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee on December 10th of this year to determine the time limit. The reason and basis for this is here. The current progress of the bandit suppression military operations is well known and need not be detailed. Shicheng and Xingguo have been recovered one after another, and Ningdu has also been captured. The relationship between these three places and the bandit nest Ruijin is extremely important. If Ruijin is the abdomen, then Xingguo is the right shoulder, Shicheng is the left shoulder, and Ningdu is the throat. With these three places captured, it is like pressing its shoulders and strangling its throat. From this, it is possible to take its abdomen, which can be said to be certain. The most worrying thing is that when the old nest is in danger, the bandits will take the opportunity to flee, which is the strategy that roving bandits have always used. Therefore, since last year, on the one hand, the existing arrangements have been made, and on the other hand, a large-scale encirclement has been implemented to gradually reduce the bandit area in order to eliminate them immediately. This kind of work is especially important today. If you are not careful, the desperate Communist bandits, once they flee elsewhere, will leave behind endless troubles. Judging from today's situation, there is a good chance of attacking the bandit's nest directly. However, whether we can prevent them from fleeing elsewhere still depends on the concerted efforts of the armies on the east, west, south, and north routes. The Central Committee cannot bear to see the difficult and arduous work of bandit suppression over the past few years fail in the end, and cannot bear to see the blood of the soldiers at the front equal to being shed in vain, and cannot bear to see the lives and property of the people become an irreparable sacrifice. Therefore, on the one hand, it strictly ordered the various armies to step up their defense, and on the other hand, it increased the number of troops to attack at the same time, with the aim of completing the entire work of bandit suppression in the shortest possible time. It is hoped that the soldiers on all routes will work together to block their breaches, prevent them from fleeing elsewhere, cut off their roots, and prevent them from reigniting. Then, the date of clearing the Communist bandits will not be far away. It is also heard that foreign countries have doubts about the increase in troops in Jiangxi, and some have said that using the completion of bandit suppression as the reason for postponing the congress is only a superficial reason. In fact, in order to implement the final large encirclement, it is necessary to increase the strength of the troops, and for the convenience of bandit suppression, it is necessary to postpone the congress. Anyone who knows a little about the situation of bandit suppression can understand this without any doubt. We know that bandit suppression work is multi-faceted military, and bandit suppression is extremely important. However, in addition to military operations, we must also carry out political bandit suppression. Otherwise, even if we achieve military victories, if the dark politics cannot be refreshed, the collapsed rural areas cannot be revived, and the psychology of the Communist bandits who incite the people cannot be cleared, it will be in vain. Not only must we proceed in a vertical direction from the military, political, economic, cultural, and all other interconnected relationships, but in a horizontal direction, we must especially concentrate the strength of all parties in the country and act simultaneously. Because the national crisis has reached this point, all citizens, regardless of each other, have only one common goal of struggle, which is to concentrate their strength to save the country and survive. The current national crisis in China is as serious as it was at the time of the Fourth National Congress. The only comfort we have gained in the past three years is that the political situation is relatively stable and the suppression of bandits has repeatedly achieved victories. We know that to save the country and survive, we must strengthen national power. To strengthen national power, there is no more urgent task than to eliminate the Communist bandits, and there is no more fundamental task than to build production. Although bandit suppression and construction are two different things, they are actually only one thing, connected to each other and cannot be ignored. I have heard some people say that the Central Committee is weak and powerless. This is completely a statement that does not understand the situation. The Central Committee is by no means weak and by no means powerless. It must be known that the military force is created by the people's blood and sweat, drop by drop. We do not want to misuse our strength, nor do we want others to misuse our strength. We must use the military force created by the people's blood and sweat for the people and for national defense. We have said that unification must be sought through construction, and military force must be used for national defense. Today, we must strive to suppress the bandits and build the country in accordance with this policy. This is true during the period of bandit suppression. Only in this way can we eliminate obstacles, concentrate our strength, and save the country and survive the difficult and arduous past three years of bandit suppression.

<h3 id="e5">To Express Concerns Regarding Grain Levy Abuses <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing - The Anhui Fellow Provincial Association in Beijing telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government on the 29th, stating: "Grain merchants report that the Dateng Pass has implemented a public levy on grain, with each stone discounted at 3.5 Jiao, without issuing receipts, and there are also reports of padding expenses. As this involves a charitable undertaking, we could not ignore it and conducted investigations, which are not unfounded. The unfortunate facts mentioned in the deleted telegram of this Association have all been discovered. Although it is like cutting flesh to mend sores and drinking poison to quench thirst, if the rules can be strictly followed and every drop is returned to the public, the disaster victims in Anhui may be able to benefit a little. However, only ten days after the start, there have been abuses of discounting for personal gain. We fear that if this continues, others will follow suit, and the difference between name and reality will become even greater. This is simply a revival of grain donations and a disguised form of Lijin. The so-called relief grain and the so-called regulations have become public documents to deceive people's eyes, causing millions of disaster victims who are waiting to die to simply rely on illusions. If you have a determination to provide relief, you should take action on this matter." (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

Regarding the change of organization of the county governments, the abolition of bureaus and the merger of sections, the attendees from the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Education had a debate. The Department of Civil Affairs advocated that all bureaus in the county should be abolished and merged.

After the chairman put it to a vote, the majority still supported the abolition and merger into sections. The original plan was passed, and the implementation rules will be formulated separately by the Department of Civil Affairs after the meeting. Regarding the case of the Salt Affairs Administration proposing to ban saltpeter in various counties and to promote the sale of reeds by township officials and deputy representatives, there was a slight debate, and it was also passed in accordance with the original plan with a minority supporting disagreement. Regarding the case of abolishing district autonomous offices and establishing autonomous guidance officers, it was decided to implement it within one month starting from January of the coming year in accordance with the review opinions. The funds for abolishing autonomy will be separately drafted by the Department of Civil Affairs for safekeeping and use. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Pseudo-Manchukuo Oil Monopoly and the Nine-Power Treaty <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— From England.</p>
<p>The greatest demands of world powers on colonies lie in the expansion of capital export and the exclusive control of resource supply. In the eyes of the Japanese, Pseudo-Manchukuo is no different from a colony. The so-called Japan-Manchukuo controlled economy theory after the September 18th Incident also came into being as a result. Taking advantage of the ongoing Naval Preparatory Conference, Japan instructed the puppet government to openly announce a system of controlling kerosene sales. This move resulted in protests from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands, countries renowned for manipulating the world kerosene market. They understood that this was the beginning of the Japanese excluding foreign forces in Manchuria, and that new laws regarding tobacco monopolies and mineral patents would soon follow.</p>
<p>According to the initial plan for Pseudo-Manchukuo's kerosene control, the import of kerosene, gasoline, and machine oil would be prohibited (crude oil would be imported by a patent company, and the government would set its price). At the same time, there would be active development of oil fields within the territory, so that their production would be sufficient to supply local consumption and fuel for the Japanese navy. The true spirit of Japan's national fuel policy lies in this. According to a report from the Geological Survey of China, the total kerosene production from Anshan, Fushun, and Benxihu in Liaoning Province last year amounted to 455,787 barrels, exceeding the total production of various parts of China by no less than 170 times. However, the Japanese are not satisfied with this. They have further established the Manchurian Petroleum Corporation, engaging in the extraction, refining, and sale of kerosene. The capital of this corporation was originally set at five million yuan, with the majority of shares belonging to the South Manchuria Railway Company, which is tasked with special national policies and has a semi-official nature. Its factories are said to be in the Kwantung Leased Territory, demonstrating its close relationship with Japan, and the recent farcical obfuscation by the Japanese government. As for the supply of oil, Fushun alone has an estimated reserve of 5.4 billion tons, of which 303 million tons can be extracted using open-pit mining methods, yielding 25,000 tons of light oil and 75,000 tons of heavy oil. There are also plans to increase capital by eight million yuan. Once its entire ideal is fully realized, the kerosene industry of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands in Manchuria, even if not eliminated, will encounter a formidable competitor. Its contribution to the combat power of the Japanese navy is universally acknowledged by those in the know.</p>
<p>Competition for world kerosene extraction rights is something that imperialists excel at. The United Kingdom and the United States, which protested against Japan this time, are leading figures in this area. The history of competition for oil rights in Persia, Venezuela, Mexico, and Sumatra has centered around the United Kingdom and the United States. The process of competition is clearly visible to all. Japan, in particular, envies this. Japan is a latecomer to the imperialist circle, and it regrets that it entered the international political stage too late and cannot do as it pleases. Therefore, it naturally regards the rights in Manchuria, which it obtained by defying the world, as sacrosanct and refuses to give them up in the slightest. This time, the United Kingdom and the United States, together with the Netherlands, lodged a protest against Japan, and their reason for protesting is based on the Nine-Power Treaty. The Nine-Power Treaty was torn up by Japan long ago. The United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries did not fulfill their obligation to prevent or correct the violation when the treaty was torn up. Only now are they using the broken treaty to negotiate with Japan. How can they get a satisfactory answer from Japan? It is pitiful for us weak Chinese people. When sovereignty is infringed and territory is lost, we shout loudly. As a result, we get nothing but empty sympathy and no international assistance. The clauses of treaties and conventions are cited again and again, said again and again, until we are exhausted, disheartened, and feel as if we share the same sentiment as the Japanese, believing that these clauses are nothing more than a few drops of ink left on torn paper. Who knew that these few drops of ink would have such value when the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the April 17th statement? Who knew that they would have such authority when the Kwantung Army prohibited British and American troops from training near Shanhaiguan? And who knew that they would have such significance when Manchukuo announced the kerosene sales control? It is a pity that this value, authority, and significance are only appreciated by us when the rights of other contracting parties are infringed. In that case, what is so much stronger about the so-called equal treaties compared to the previous unequal treaties?</p>
<p>We also remember that after Japan issued the April 17th statement, people in and out of the government in China had the idea of convening a meeting of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, news from the international community said that even if this matter could be raised, it would definitely not have any results. Unexpectedly, the words "Nine-Power Treaty" are now prominently featured in newspapers, and people actually remember that the long-lost Pseudo-Manchukuo is still Chinese territory.</p>
<p>However, we also know that the reference to the open door policy in the Nine-Power Treaty in the protests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands against Japan is merely a diplomatic tactic. The weapons of opposition in the internal workings are certainly not limited to this one point.</p>

<p>Maintaining Independence as a Necessary Condition</p>
<p>Vienna: A very important political meeting was held here today, attended by Chancellor Schuschnigg, Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg, and leaders of the Patriotic Front, including former Austrian National Socialist leader Herr Riel. This has attracted much attention. Although the meeting was announced as the first of its kind, with no concrete results, both parties briefly stated their political views without further discussion. However, political circles generally believe that this matter will have a significant impact on the future of Austrian politics, perhaps prompting nationalist parties to actively join the government to restore friendly relations between Germany and Austria. The government also announced that Chancellor Schuschnigg had made unconditional support for the independence of the Austrian nation the only condition for nationalist parties to join the government, but there would be room for further discussion in the future. It is also heard that Adam, Secretary-General of the Patriotic Front, will represent the government in future negotiations. (Dispatch from the 28th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>Vienna: Today, Chancellor Schuschnigg delivered an important speech to the Catholic Stormtroopers, and Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg delivered an important speech to the Internal Defense Force. Prince Starhemberg spoke about direct negotiations with the German National Socialist Party, saying that the German National Socialist Party should not assume that we will become brothers as soon as we talk to them. We Austrians must demand faithful guarantees from the German National Socialist Party, otherwise we will be committing suicide. Chancellor Schuschnigg strongly stated that armed groups outside the regular army must unite, and that the current government will continue the policies begun by former Chancellor Dollfuss to achieve success. The Vice-Chancellor's speech on this matter was the same. (Dispatch from the 28th, Havas)</p>

Left-wing Labour MP McGovern gave a passionate speech, extensively discussing the section in Philip Gibbs' war memoir that criticized General Haig, the commander-in-chief of the British Army during the European War, for wasting British soldiers' lives in Flanders, Belgium. His words were so intense that they moved the audience. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>London – Recently, the government proposed a bill requesting Parliament to allow the government to punish propaganda campaigns of a disruptive nature that could undermine the loyalty of the army to the Crown. The opposition Labour Party believes this bill is aimed at suppressing populist unrest and has launched a campaign among people from all walks of life to express their opposition. They posted slogans in Trafalgar Square, boldly stating, "Our freedom or your laws, one cannot exist with the other." Over four thousand people gathered in the square, cheering and demonstrating. The British people's concern for political freedom is evident here. Labour Party members also humorously pointed out that if the government's bill had been passed before the European War, the literary giant George Bernard Shaw and Prime Minister MacDonald himself would have been arrested long ago and spent the four years of the war in prison. Prime Minister MacDonald will attend a banquet of the National Labour Committee tomorrow and deliver a speech, a large part of which will be used to discuss this issue. Its great importance can be imagined. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>London – The National Labour Party entertained Prime Minister MacDonald today. Many important government officials were present. MacDonald delivered a speech in which he said that a government of national unity has created trust and security and should therefore be maintained. The country is not yet ready to return to party politics. He appealed to the British people, especially the youth, to view the government of national unity as a manifestation of a great philosophy of social progress. Security and organized evolution are a policy that can advance the country without being subject to disruptive interruptions of continuity, which is the opposite of harsh measures and revolution. Lord President of the Council Baldwin then spoke, saying that there was no sign of a return to a major party succession in the near future. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

In Irkutsk, 28 workers were tried for stealing products from a factory. Four were sentenced to death, six to ten years of imprisonment, four to five years of imprisonment, and the rest to short-term imprisonment. In Tiflis, the director of a savings bank was also executed for attempting to commit fraud. The Soviet Russian government has recently issued serious warnings to officials in all departments and has begun to crack down on all major and minor cases of fraud.

<p>Moscow – Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, wrote an article on the Soviet elections, saying, "We can be justly proud of the achievements of the Soviet regime. Today, only we have opened up a path of cultural development for the Soviet people. Our great task today is to fully utilize all our production resources, build new factories, power plants, and mines, etc. These undertakings are all beneficial to our motherland. We have, as required by reality, undergone a period of training and overcoming new technologies. This is especially true in the countryside. Only if we more fully utilize the shameful idleness of all the machinery in collective and state-owned farms, can the harvests of grains, sugar beets, flax, and cotton be rapidly increased. Our country has many economic possibilities that have not yet been utilized. Our development is quite impressive. All that we need is to strive for the utilization of new enterprises and new technologies, and at the same time, to achieve this, we must intensify the improvement of the cultural level of the masses, increase labor discipline, and increase the responsibility of leaders for their work. The Communist Party demands an intensified struggle against the bureaucracy of the entire national administration. A concrete and effective leadership, combined with supervision and execution, has become the slogan of the Communist Party in the practical work of all departments. The Communist Party strictly requires personnel serving the national economy to deeply study the technology of the positions they hold, overcome production methods, and truly take on the responsibilities they bear.</p>
<p>Our country's non-Party intellectuals are also developing. The growth of such personnel, both within and outside the Party, especially the growth of Soviet youth, is a guarantee of our future success. The scale of this success should not be underestimated. The system adopted in our country is indeed laying a solid foundation for the growing development of these new forces. At present, the need for culture is most enormous. This is why our country urgently needs culture. They strive for culture and strive to satisfy their demands. At the same time, this is why the Soviet regime was created by the working masses of our country. These issues, at the time of these Soviet re-elections, will be expressed with new strength to hundreds of millions of toiling masses, and at the same time will have greater significance for the work of the newly elected Soviets.</p>
<p>We believe that at the time of re-elections, any person who is hostile to the Soviet regime will never dare to openly show their face. However, this must not lead us to consider the resistance to all anti-Soviet actions of our class enemies, the exposure of all unreliable elements entering the Soviets, and the abandonment of all opportunistic and liberal rhetoric as unnecessary. The Soviets we need are the battle organizations for the working masses to fight against their class enemies. Our enemies will eventually understand the invincible enthusiasm of millions of socialist builders, or they will disarm or cease their anti-Soviet actions and their opposition to the collective farming system, or they will inevitably suffer the merciless blow of the proletariat dictatorship, which is dedicated to self-defense.</p>
<p>The international position of the Soviet Republic, especially its position as a factor for general peace, is increasing day by day. This is a well-known fact. The Soviet Union's position as a strong country capable of destroying imperialist aggression has even made the bourgeoisie look up with respect and view the Soviet Union as a world power."

<p>Bombay – Tonight, Gandhi, in his capacity as President of the Indian National Congress, delivered his swan song, broadcasting to an audience of 80,000 people through loudspeakers. A sound film company was also present to film and record the event. During his speech, three searchlights illuminated the venue. Gandhi moved to amend the constitution of the Indian National Congress, advocating that the number of representatives be limited to 2,000, etc. The motion was passed by a majority of members. Prior to the Congress, a resolution had been passed to establish an All-India Rural Industries Association, to be guided by Gandhi. Therefore, Gandhi will apparently infuse his spirit into both the Textile Association and this new organization in the future. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Bombay – Mahatma Gandhi's resignation from the presidency of the National Congress seems to be a tactic, as he wants to have dictatorial powers when he rises again next time. Gandhi plans to first prepare an economic break with Britain in the villages, and then lead the Indian people to oppose the draft constitution currently under discussion in Britain through passive resistance. Gandhi declared that he was very satisfied with the action plan he had drawn up, which was approved at the closing of the National Congress. During the Congress, more than one million people visited the venue. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Japan Considers Tax Increase <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo – Finance Minister Fujii has now established a special wartime profits tax, which is expected to increase tax revenue by up to 100 million yen. He also plans to increase revenue through other methods. It is reported that an increase in postal rates may increase revenue by approximately 30 million yen, and an increase in the railway profits account may increase revenue in the general account by approximately 30 million yen. Adding these two items to the increase in the wartime profits tax, the total amount is expected to reach 100 million yen. The Finance Minister plans to discuss all the above points with former Finance Minister Takahashi and seek his understanding. (Japan United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – At 3:50 p.m. this afternoon, Prime Minister Okada visited former Finance Minister Takahashi at his private residence in Akasaka to exchange views on the tax increase issue. He left at 5:10 p.m. After the meeting, former Finance Minister Takahashi said that Prime Minister Okada's visit was aimed at seeking my opinion on the succession of the budget for the next fiscal year. The contents cannot be disclosed. As for the preparation of the budget, Finance Minister Fujii is working hard on it, so I have nothing more to say at this time. However, the tax increase issue was indeed discussed. (Denstu, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – When the government prepares the budget for the next fiscal year, whether or not to implement a tax increase has attracted the attention of the financial community and all sectors. Finance Minister Fujii, in view of the political, economic, and social circumstances, decided to increase tax revenue. Therefore, on the 27th, he visited former Finance Minister Takahashi for an hour and a half, expressed his views on the tax increase, and requested his understanding. After considering the measures in the past two or three days, Finance Minister Fujii met with Prime Minister Okada, obtained his consent, and formally decided on the tax increase policy.</p>
<p>The extent of Finance Minister Fujii's tax increase plan is approximately 30 million or 100 million yen. The industries that will be affected by the tax increase are export industries, military industries, industries, the securities industry, and the construction industry. Finance Minister Fujii plans to increase the special income tax, not the general customs duties.</p>
<p>The contents of Finance Minister Fujii's tax increase plan are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Compare the income determination amount for Showa 9 (1934) with the income determination amount for Showa 5 (1930) and Showa 6 (1931). The average increase will be determined as special income.</p>
<p>2.  The tax rate is set at 10% proportional tax, but the loss calculation at the time of gold export prohibition and the newly established ones are set at 8%.</p>
<p>3.  The implementation period is tentatively set for three or five years. (Japan United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Although Finance Minister Fujii has decided to implement the tax increase, Prime Minister Okada had previously stated that there would be no tax increase in the next fiscal year, so he does not approve of the tax increase plan. Moreover, except for the Minister of the Army, other cabinet members have considerable disagreements regarding the tax increase. Therefore, Finance Minister Fujii's proposed tax increase plan will inevitably encounter considerable turmoil until the two houses make a decision. (Denstu, 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Siam Troubled: Finance and Military are the Key Issues <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Situation Worsens After Revolution</p>
<p>Rumor That the King of Siam Will Never Return Home Has Been Around for a Long Time</p>
<p>London – Siamese bonds were weak today, but the general public in the stock exchange is now eagerly awaiting accurate news on the situation in Siam. A retired senior official who had lived in Siam for many years and still has close contact with the situation in Siam told a Reuters reporter today that although Siam appears peaceful on the surface and the Siamese people are peace-loving, the political circles are currently very turbulent. The fundamental difficulties at present are half due to finance and half due to the military. The revolution in 1932 made the military aware of the need to compete for power. This was the first time in Siamese history. Since then, the military's competition for power has become a disruptive factor. The government established after the revolution abolished miscellaneous taxes to win the hearts of the people. As a result, national income was greatly reduced, and the country often struggled financially. In addition, when the King and Queen of Siam traveled to Europe last time, they spent a large amount of money purchasing machinery, believing that this would benefit the development of Siamese industries. As a result, the finances became even more strained. The Minister of Finance exhausted all means to pay for this amount. When the King of Siam went to England this spring, rumors spread that the King would never return home. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>Striving for Privileges and Supporting Democratic Governance</p>
<p>No News of Incidents Occurring in the Country</p>
<p>London – Today, the King of Siam, through his private secretary, made a clear statement to a Reuters reporter that his struggle for the privilege of pronouncing the death penalty is actually a struggle to uphold the principles of democratic government. The elected members of parliament are now mostly opposed to the plan to strip the king of his powers. Therefore, his refusal to sign the new bill is directly based on the wishes of the majority of the people. He feels that the people do not want to change the current system. Therefore, the King of Siam's intention to abdicate has the nature of a démarche expressing grief to his government. The government can only completely abandon the new plan, submit it to a public vote, or hold a general election to avoid the King of Siam's abdication. So far, the King of Siam and the government have not directly negotiated. The King of Siam entrusted his regent in Bangkok with his intention to abdicate to the government about ten days ago. The government has strongly urged the King of Siam to reconsider his decision. Since announcing his intention to abdicate, the King of Siam has not received any news of incidents or revolutions occurring in the country. At present, only the Siamese government has asked the King to reconsider his decision. The Siamese military and other circles have not taken such action. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Describes Their Nature</p>
<p>Athens – Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu recently responded to inquiries from the Greek Kathimerini newspaper, saying that the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente cooperate with each other, but are not merged into one. The Little Entente and the Balkan Entente have the same ultimate goal, but their scope of activities is different. Titulescu also said that the next session of the Permanent Political Council of the Balkan Entente countries will be held in the capital of Romania. As for the fact that the recent conference of the Balkan Entente countries was held in the capital of Yugoslavia, and now a conference is being held in the capital of Turkey, it is because the conference in the capital of Yugoslavia was a special conference, while the conference in the capital of Turkey is a regular conference. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Ankara – The political conference of the Balkan Entente is scheduled to open here on October 30. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu has already arrived here.

<p>Belgrade – According to reports from Rome, the Italian court has refused to extradite Pavelic and Kvaternik, two members of the Croatian terrorist group who were arrested in Turin. Public sentiment here is increasingly outraged by this news. However, the newspapers have not attacked the Italian side, but are quite intolerant of Hungary. "Politika" is the only newspaper to mention the Italian state, but the wording is cautious. The newspaper stated that extraditing Pavelic and Kvaternik is the path that Italy should take in order to avoid causing misunderstandings internationally. The newspaper added that there is no doubt that Pavelic and Kvaternik are directly related to the Marseille assassination. Therefore, if Italy can extradite these two people, it will greatly benefit the clarification of the European political atmosphere. Moreover, Italy may not intend to harbor such murderers within its borders. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris – "Le Petit Parisien" reprinted news from a newspaper in the capital of Yugoslavia, citing news from the capital of Hungary, stating that Hungarian police recently arrested a leader of a terrorist group, who was an important assistant to Pavelic, the leader of the group arrested in Turin, Italy. However, after being arrested, he disappeared. It is generally believed that he has been assassinated and his body thrown into the Danube River. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Budapest – Selvasse, a member of the Croatian terrorist group, changed his name to Szentelei and hid in the capital of Hungary, directing the activities of the Hungarian Wastacs. Since the Marseille assassination, the Yugoslav envoy to Hungary has requested the Hungarian authorities to search for him. Recently, rumors have spread that Selvasse has been arrested and has died. The Hungarian authorities have recently denied this rumor, saying that it is completely unfounded. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Vienna – The French Chargé d'Affaires in Vienna recently notified the Austrian government that Ban Berquevic, a member of the Croatian terrorist group, is related to the Marseille assassination.

<p>Washington – Although the relationship between bankers and the government in Washington has greatly improved recently, financial leaders still believe that the government will control the banking industry. It has been learned from reliable sources today that the Treasury Department is still studying banking legislation to expand the Federal Reserve Board, so that the Federal Reserve Board will fully become a central bank. However, the Associated Press has learned that the Treasury Department's experts will not submit their investigation report to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau in the next seven weeks. Although President Roosevelt ridiculed the proposal to establish a central bank last week and repeatedly reaffirmed his confidence in the profit system and the use of private capital to finance industries, the idea of a central bank is still suspected by all sectors. Some people say that the funds lent by the central banker, the unified banking system, avoid conflicts in lending policies between banks, and organize a committee to be solely responsible for the central bank. Generally speaking, the central bank of the United States, no matter what form it takes, will make the government's control more obvious than the current Federal Reserve Board. Currently, 6,300 of the 15,500 banks nationwide belong to the Federal Reserve Board. Therefore, most bankers have recognized it as a central bank, because it not only determines the discount rate within the twelve Federal Reserve districts, but also promotes the government's financial reform policies in a timely manner. Another central bank function of the Federal Reserve Board is that the cash used by the Federal Reserve Board exceeds more than half of the national currency. The Federal Reserve Board also determines all banking and lending policies for the twelve Federal Reserve districts to adopt. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>

<p>She Hanged Her Child on a Tree Branch</p>
<p>And Entrusted Her Other Child to Someone for Adoption</p>
<p>Beiping: Yesterday morning, an infant, barely over one year old, was discovered on a willow tree next to the Second Gate of the Dongbianmen outside the city. It was tied with a cloth rope and hung from a tree branch, crying incessantly. Xue Jingde, a nearby farmer, rushed to rescue it. A letter was found in the child’s clothing, signed Mei Xiuying, who identified herself as the wife of Shi Cantang, the mastermind behind the Chadian train bombing. She stated that since Shi was executed, she did not want to live alone. Therefore, she committed suicide by drowning herself in the river, but could not bear to let her young child die with her. She entrusted the child to benevolent people for adoption, hoping he would grow up. The farmer took the baby home to care for it and kept the original letter from Shi’s wife, to explain the child's background when he grows up. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e87">National Army Recaptures Ningdu <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Remnants of the Bandits Retreat Southwest Towards Yudu</p>
<p>Refugees From Weifeng Recall Their Resistance Against the Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Ningdu is a large county in southern Jiangxi with a dense population and fertile land. It is interwoven with Nanfeng, Le'an, and Yongfeng to the north. The terrain is complex and dangerous. Wangpo, Xiaopu, Kuzhu, and other notorious bandit lairs are scattered throughout the area. To the east, it is connected to Xingguo, Guangchang, and Shicheng. To the west, it adjoins Yongfeng, Xingguo, Yudu. To the south, it directly reaches Ruijin. Militarily, geographically, and economically, it is crucial to the Red bandits. The National Army’s First Route Army, after capturing the transportation hub of Guangchang, Shicheng and Ningdu, advanced on both sides, simultaneously capturing Shicheng and Ningdu. After the successive capture of Shicheng's Gulonggang and Ningdu, the momentum for annihilation was established. The false Third Army Corps retreated from Shicheng towards eastern Ningdu, and the false Eighth Army Corps and the false First Army Corps retreated from Xingguo Gulonggang to Qingtang (the border between Ningdu and Yudu). Although they wanted to defend their positions to the death, the firepower of the National Army’s airplanes and cannons was overwhelming. They fled southwest towards Yudu and Huichang. The National Army, in order to quickly complete the task of eradicating the bandits, launched a joint attack on Ningdu for several days. The operation progressed extremely rapidly. The headquarters recently received a telephone call from the Northern Route Army headquarters, stating that Zhou’s division of Chen Cheng’s Third Route Army captured Ningdu County on the evening of the 26th. Refugees have entered the city to comfort the people, repair fortifications, and conduct post-war relief efforts, while continuing to advance on the bandits. According to records, the Red bandits, led by Zhu De and Mao Zedong, entered Ningdu several times in 1928. The National Army gained and lost the city in turns. In 1929, it was completely occupied by the bandits. In 1930, the Third Route Army launched a major campaign to suppress the bandits, and the city was recovered temporarily. Sun Lianzhong's division of the Twenty-sixth Route Army was stationed there. However, on December 15, 1931, Zhao Bosheng suddenly led Dong Zhentang and Ji Zhentong in a mutiny. They were incorporated into the Red bandit forces as the false Fifth Army Corps. Ningdu fell into the hands of the bandits once again. For several years since then, production facilities have been completely destroyed, and countless men and women have died. The entire county is scorched earth, a heartbreaking sight. Recovery will take decades of cultivation. However, since the rebel Zhao Bosheng reoccupied Ningdu in 1931, groups of refugees fled to mountain strongholds to resist the bandits. There were as many as dozens of these strongholds. These strongholds were like isolated islands in the sea to the bandits. They maintained their integrity and defended themselves for two years. When the strongholds fell, the entire population died as bravely as Tian Heng's followers, without a single surrender. Cuiwei Peak is one such example. The peak is located ten miles from the county seat and is a steep, towering peak. The summit covers hundreds of acres and was the place where sages of past generations studied and lectured. There are fields, ponds, wells, and thatched cottages. There is only a single hole carved between two rocks that can be climbed to ascend, with no other passages. Since the refugees defended it in December 1931, the bandits repeatedly besieged it, but failed to capture it. During that time, high-ranking military agencies sent planes to supply the refugees with salt and bullets. The refugees eventually reached the point of exchanging children for food, until the stronghold was finally broken by the bandits in January 1933. At that time, refugees jumped into wells, committed suicide, killed their children, or husbands killed their wives before killing themselves. The entire stronghold sacrificed itself, making it a heroic and tragic story in the resistance against the bandits. (October 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e88">Japanese Actively Expanding the Southeast Asian Market <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Dispatching Commercial Commissioners to Siam for Inspection</p>
<p>Annual Sales of Japanese Goods to Siam Exceed 10 Million Gold</p>
<p>Bangkok Special Correspondent: Since British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies have implemented trade controls and restricted the import of Japanese goods, the Japanese goods market in Southeast Asia has been severely impacted. Japanese merchants have panicked and demanded that their government negotiate with the colonial authorities of Britain and the Netherlands. However, the British government, in order to protect its major Lancashire textile market from being taken over, seems to be determined to restrict the import of Japanese cotton textiles into its Southeast Asian colonies. Therefore, although the Japanese have protested many times, they have been ineffective. As for the Dutch side, after the Dutch East Indies government announced import restrictions on 56 commodities, the Dutch-Japanese conference was convened to ease tensions due to the serious protests from the Japanese side. However, the conference has been going on for months since it opened in mid-June, with reports of progress and tension at times. So far, there has been no progress. Under such circumstances, the Japanese are unwilling to sit idly by and await their demise, and can only seek alternative routes in Southeast Asia to find outlets for their goods.</p>
<p>In addition to the colonies of Britain and the Netherlands, the other islands of Southeast Asia, such as the American-controlled Philippines and the French-controlled Annam, have high tariff barriers to prevent the large-scale import of goods from non-sovereign countries. Therefore, Japan cannot satisfy its desires in these two places either. As a result of agonizing and energetic efforts, the Japanese are planning to expand a new market. What is this new market? It is Siam. Siam is located on the Indochina Peninsula, northeast of the Malay Peninsula, and is the only independent country in Southeast Asia. It covers an area of approximately 195,000 square miles and has a population of approximately 10 million. The people are mainly engaged in agriculture. With the exception of rice mills and sawmills, other light and heavy industries are extremely backward, making it an excellent market for industrial products. In the past, Siam also had considerable political ties with Japan. For example, when the League of Nations voted last year to deny recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo, representatives from countries around the world unanimously voted against it, while the Siamese representative abstained, expressing goodwill towards Japan. Therefore, now that Japan is facing restrictions on the import of its goods by various Southeast Asian colonies, it has no choice but to expand its market in Siam to seek remedy.</p>
<p>According to sources here, the Osaka Japanese Chamber of Commerce, on the pretext of improving the current state of trade between Japan and Siam, will soon send a commercial commissioner to Siam for negotiations. Its purpose is self-evident. In recent years, the annual import of Japanese goods into Siam has exceeded 12 million Japanese yen (approximately 8 million Siamese baht), while the annual import of Siamese products into Japan is only worth 800,000 Japanese yen (approximately 600,000 Siamese baht). Japan's trade surplus with Siam has exceeded 11 million Japanese yen, and it is still actively planning to expand. Although it is said that the restrictions imposed by Britain and the Netherlands are inevitable, Japan's ambition cannot be concealed. If we look back at the situation of our country's trade with Siam, the difference is incalculable. According to a survey, from January to August of this year, the total value of Siamese products imported into our country was 25.5 million yuan, while during the same period, our country's exports to Siam were only 8.8 million yuan. Our trade deficit reached more than 16.7 million yuan. Moreover, there are approximately 2.5 million overseas Chinese in Siam, dozens or hundreds of times more than the number of Japanese residents.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Inside Truths of the Jiangxi Bandits <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Notes Published by Yang Yuebin,</p>
<p>Pseudo-Central Minister of Armed Forces, After Surrendering to the National Army</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Yang Yuebin, the Red Bandit’s Central Mobilization Minister of Armed Forces, who recently escaped from the bandit area of Ninghua and surrendered to the Third Division's Special Party Department in Liancheng, recently published notes recording the true situation inside the bandit areas. The following is an excerpt of the important parts:</p>
<p>Since the Fujian Incident and the failure of the 19th Route Army, the bandits have been severely impacted. After the Central Army's five encirclement and suppression campaigns and the successive capture of Guangchang, Jianning, and Liancheng, the bandits organized expanded Red Army assault teams and economic movement assault teams in the bandit areas, forcing men between the ages of 16 and 45 to join the Red Army, resulting in over 53,000 soldiers. They extorted over 200,000 piculs of grain. The pseudo-Central Military Commission attempted to concentrate all its forces in the area between Ruijin and Shicheng, or near Ruijin, for a final desperate gamble, preserving the military equipment accumulated by the Red bandits over the years and calling on other bandit areas to preserve the so-called Central Soviet Area. If the decisive battle failed, they would break up a part of their forces into smaller units, scattering them throughout Fujian and Jiangxi. The main force would be regrouped and flee through Anyuan, Xinfeng, and Sannan into southern Hunan, escaping to Sichuan or the Yunnan-Guizhou border to join forces with the Xu and He bandits, attempting to enter Sichuan. Between April and May, the pseudo-Central government had already transferred many cadres from the bandit army who were natives of southern Hunan, secretly returning them to various counties in southern Hunan to establish communication lines. The bandits in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian originally consisted of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 12th, and 13th Armies, which were reorganized into the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Army Corps. The 10th Army was stationed in the northeast. Since August of last year, the bandit leader Peng Dehuai led the 5th and 7th Armies to occupy Yangkou. After the Russian Li De infiltrated the bandit area, he reorganized the bandit army, abolished the army system, and strengthened the combat troops, adding battalion headquarters. The division was established as a fixed organizational unit. The pseudo-Third Army was renamed the First Division, the pseudo-Seventh Army was renamed the Fifth Division, the pseudo-Thirteenth Army was renamed the Thirteenth Division, and the pseudo-Twelfth Army was renamed the Thirty-fourth Division. In addition, civilians were recruited in the bandit areas and reorganized into the Red Garrison Army and guerrilla teams, forming the Third, Sixth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Twenty-second, and Twenty-third Divisions. According to the three-three system, each battalion consisted of three infantry companies. The battalion headquarters had a heavy machine gun platoon, equipped with two heavy machine guns. Most of the soldiers were new recruits, with very few veterans. There was an extreme shortage of cadres. In each battle, cadre casualties accounted for half of the soldiers. The organization of the entire bandit army, with the First, Second, and Fifteenth Divisions belonging to the First Army Corps, led by Corps Commander Lin Biao, Political Commissar Nie Yunzhen, Chief of Staff Zuo Quan, and Director of the Political Department Li Zhuoran. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Divisions belonged to the Third Army Corps, led by Corps Commander Peng Dehuai, Political Commissar Yang Shangkun, Chief of Staff Bu Ping, and Director of the Political Department Yuan Guoping. The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Divisions belonged to the Fifth Army Corps, led by Corps Commander Dong Zhentang (formerly the brigade commander of Sun Lianzhong's division who defected to the bandit army in 1931), Political Commissar Zhu Duan, and Director of the Political Department Liu Baijian. The Chief of Staff was vacant. The Red bandit pseudo-Military Commission designated the First, Third, and Fifth Army Corps as assault brigades, gathering them for decisive battles. The Seventh Army Corps had the Fifteenth Division, with Corps Commander and Division Commander Xun Huaizhou, Political Commissar Le Shaohua, Chief of Staff Li Yu, and Director of the Political Department Liu Ying. This army corps had approximately 4,300 soldiers and 1,700 guns, responsible for containing the enemy on the eastern side of the bandit area. The Ninth Army Corps was led by Commander and Division Commander Luo Binghui, Political Commissar Cai Shufan, and the Chief of Staff was vacant. This army corps had approximately 3,600 soldiers and 2,000 guns, responsible for containing the enemy on the northeastern side of the bandit area. After July, the main forces of the army corps acted strangely.</p>
<p>Statistically, the entire bandit army was divided into fourteen divisions, three supplementary divisions, six independent regiments, and two training regiments, totaling 86,700 people with 33,800 guns (number, personnel, and name of the chief omitted). However, due to the battles of August and September, more than 10,000 people abandoned their weapons and fled home. The locations of the pseudo-military districts, leaders, and their subordinate soldiers are listed as follows: 1. Jiangxi Military District, Commander Chen Yi, with one division and three independent regiments, stationed in Luokou (under Ningdu), responsible for defending the northwest lines of the bandit area; 2. Fujian Military District, Ye Jianying, with a central division stationed in Tingzhou, responsible for defending the eastern lines of the bandit area; 3. (Min-Gan Military District Shao Shiping), with one regiment and small guerrilla units, originally stationed in Anyuan Ninghua, responsible for defending the northeast lines of the bandit area; 4. Guangdong-Jiangxi Military District, Commander He Changgong, with one division and an independent regiment stationed in Huichang, responsible for defending the southern lines of the bandit area; 5. Southern Jiangxi Military District, Commander Xiang Ying, with two regiments stationed in Yudu, responsible for defending the southwest lines of the bandit area. The organization of the Red bandit pseudo-Central Military Commission is the highest military command agency of the bandit army, modeled after the Red Army organization of the Red Machine. It is divided into six departments: 1. General Headquarters (i.e., General Staff Department); 2. General Political Department; 3. General Supply Department (i.e., Quartermaster Department); 4. General Health Department (i.e., Military Medical Department); 5. General Logistics Department; 6. General Mobilization and Armaments Department (managing the bandit army's troop strength, replenishment, and independent small units). In addition to the six departments, there is also a Secretariat and a pseudo-Chemical Research Laboratory (responsible for air defense and poison gas). Each army corps and military district also has four departments: Command, Political, Supply, and Health (the military district also has a Mobilization and Armaments Department). Bandit leader Zhu De is the Chairman of the pseudo-Central Military Commission, Zhou Enlai and Wang Jiaxiang are the Vice Chairmen, Li De (a Russian who entered the bandit area in August of last year) is the advisor, Liu Bocheng is the Chief of General Staff, Wang Jiaxiang is also the Director of the Political Department, He Chang is the Deputy Director, Ye Lizhuang is the Minister of Supply, He Cheng is the Minister of Health, Yang Lisan is the Director of the General Logistics Department, and Knee Daiyuan is the Director of the General Mobilization and Armaments Department.</p>
<p>The following factories are under the pseudo-Military Commission: (A) Ordnance Factory, located near Ruijin Ruilinjia, with more than 100 workers, manufacturing explosives and bullets, and domestically-made rifles; (B) Radio and Communications Equipment Factory, with only eleven shortwave radios, two for each of the three army corps, one each for the 5th, 7th, and 9th Armies, and one each for the Jiangxi and Fujian-Jiangxi Military Districts, and one for the pseudo-Military Commission. There is also a longwave radio, used to communicate with Vladivostok; (C) Communications Materials Factory, located seven miles east of Ruijin, lacking gasoline and kerosene. Only the supplies seized in Zhangzhou the previous year remain, enough for three or four months. Radio materials are also extremely scarce; (D) Pseudo-Health Department, managing eleven rear hospitals and two disability homes. Usually, there are 1,500 to 2,000 wounded and sick officers and soldiers, and more than 10,000 disabled. In total, there are 20 to 30 bandit army hospitals, with a constant population of over 20,000 wounded and sick soldiers. Medicines are extremely scarce. The health materials factory only produces Chinese medicine decoctions to replace Western medicine. Gauze is replaced with thin cotton cloth, and cotton is generally ripped from old cotton clothes. The wounded and sick soldiers are in unbearable conditions. There are frequent suicides in the hospitals. Therefore, junior officers and soldiers of the bandit army generally say that they would rather be killed than be sent to the rear. As for the bandit army's supplies and the morale of junior and middle-ranking officers and soldiers, before July of last year, the bandit army's meals cost 1.5 jiao (paper yuan) per person per day. From January to March/April of this year, the cost of meals was reduced to 1.2 jiao per person. After the Central Army captured Guangchang and Jianning, the bandit army uniformly issued grain. During marches, each person received 1.4 jin of rice per day and 4 fen for vegetables. When stationed, each person received 1 jin of rice per day (two meals a day). No money has been issued for two years. Straw sandals are made by the soldiers themselves. Because the National Army blocked the bandit area, no cloth or cotton was allowed into the area. Last winter, cotton clothes were only issued to two-thirds of the soldiers, and a large part of them were old cotton clothes that had been worn for several years and were tattered. No summer uniforms were issued this spring, and for the autumn cotton clothes, the bandit leaders ordered the soldiers' families to send them to the army. Salt is extremely scarce in the bandit area. Each paper yuan can only buy eight qian of salt. Since the bandit army withdrew from Guangchang, Jianning, Liancheng, Yunmenling, etc., they have been constantly eating bland food. The lives of the Red bandit officers and soldiers are extremely miserable. They generally have two kinds of mentality: those who live outside the bandit area constantly think of defecting, while those who live in the bandit area often plan to abandon their weapons and return home. However, the Red Party and bandit leaders Zhu De, Mao Zedong, etc., knowing that the military's morale is wavering, closely monitor the junior and middle-ranking officers and soldiers in the bandit army in order to prolong their lives. Each level of officers is assigned a political commissar to monitor them. All orders and notifications are not effective unless signed by the Political Committee. Military officers have command authority but no administrative authority. They also set up a security bureau and special commissioners to deploy many secret detectives (the so-called political detective network). Therefore, soldiers who are slightly careless in their words or whose attitudes change are immediately arrested. Currently, bandit leaders prohibit three to five people from gathering and talking in the bandit army.</p>
<p>The pseudo-Central government has established the following military schools: (A) Red Army University, located at Dashuxia in the lower Xiao District, ten miles from Ruijin. The principal is Zhou Kun, who once served as the commander of the pseudo-Fourth Army. His left leg is disabled. There are approximately 200-300 students, divided into a senior class, an advanced command course, and an advanced staff course, training cadres above the battalion and regimental level; (B) Peng Yang Infantry School, located in Jiubao, Ruijin. The principal is Chen Yu. There are 1,000 students who will graduate in April, also training company and platoon cadres; (C) Gonglue Infantry School, located near Yudu City. The principal is Lin Ye. There are 800-900 students who will graduate in April, also training company and platoon cadres; (D) Special Forces School, located in Ruijin Wuchangtuan. The principal is Hu Guojie. There are 400-500 students, divided into artillery, engineering, heavy machine gun teams, and anti-aircraft gun teams. They graduate in one year; (E) Local Cadre School, located in Shangxiafang near Ruijin. The principal is Liu Yunhai. There are over 300 students, who are cadres sent from various guerrilla teams, independent regiments, and Red Garrison Armies. They graduate in three months; (F) Radio School, the principal is Mr. Liu, with 100 students. They graduate in one and a half years; (G) Health School, the principal is Chen Yihou. Except for the Radio and Health Schools, the rest are armed, equipped with various weapons, ready for battle. This is also the pseudo-Central government's garrison force. (October 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Fujian Province Raises Funds for Disaster Relief <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Fujian Province Fundraising Team is Established</p>
<p>Chen Yi Serves as the Chief Captain</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian authorities previously stated that the province had suffered from banditry and drought for years, and that the disaster areas were vast and the disaster situation was severe, urgently requiring relief. They specially dispatched Li Guodian, the third section chief of the Department of Civil Affairs, to Nanjing and Nanchang to request relief. He returned to Fujian the day before yesterday. According to his report, he was ordered to report the disaster situation in the province to the Relief Committee in Beijing and request relief. The committee stated that it was experiencing financial difficulties and agreed to do its best to request funds from the Ministry of Finance, but the Ministry of Finance stated that the national treasury was stretched and could only help find a way, so it was difficult to predict when the funds could be remitted to Fujian. He then went to Jiangxi to report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the situation. Secretary-General Yang appeared on Chiang's behalf and also said that the expeditionary headquarters was experiencing financial difficulties and was unable to provide relief to the disaster-stricken provinces, ordering them to devise their own proper solutions. Therefore, this trip yielded no results. Since the central government was unable to help, the provincial government decided to organize a fundraising team to appeal to philanthropists at home and abroad, to gather contributions and provide relief to the disaster victims. Chairman Chen Yi himself served as the Chief Captain of the Fujian Province Fundraising Team. The provincial government sent letters to the department heads of the province, the administrative inspectors of each district, the chairmen of chambers of commerce in commercial ports, and the chairmen of Fujian associations in various provinces, and the chairmen of Fujian guilds on the islands of Southeast Asia, appointing more than 50 people as team leaders. The appointment letters and donation books were issued yesterday, hoping that they would follow the procedures, establish fundraising teams, and immediately embark on fundraising. The deadline for establishment is the middle of November at the latest, and the deadline for completion is the end of March next year, reporting once every month on the 15th to facilitate comparison. Meanwhile, Li Zuyu, the head of the Department of Civil Affairs and the chairman of the Provincial Relief Committee, sent a letter to Xu Shiying, chairman of the National Relief Committee, detailing the disaster situation in the province and requesting relief. The letter stated that since the summer of this year, the weather in Fujian Province has been erratic, starting with continuous rain for many days, causing floods. Twenty-five counties, including Minhou, have suffered from floods. The extent of the disaster and the severity of the situation have been reported and verified. Subsequently, severe droughts occurred, and farmland cracked. The autumn harvest is hopeless. Six counties, including Putian, Pingnan, Yongchun, Fuqing, Yongding, and Minhou, have already reported drought disasters. The disaster and suffering in Fujian Province have reached an extreme point. This year's floods and droughts are even more devastating. How can the people bear it? It is reported that you are holding meetings in Shanghai to raise funds for urgent relief in various provinces. The disaster situation in Fujian Province is severe, no less than other provinces, and should be included in the list of those needing relief. It is hoped that you will quickly distribute large sums of money to relieve the suffering. We will pray without end. In addition, when the Red banditry was rampant last spring and summer, there were as many as 5,000 to 6,000 refugees from northwestern Fujian fleeing to the province. At that time, temples and ancestral halls inside and outside the city were filled. Subsequently, the government, the chamber of commerce, and various charities jointly established a refugee relief office, accommodating the refugees in Huangshan Township in the southern district, distributing food and clothing according to their needs. The treatment was quite considerate. This summer, the counties in the bandit area were successively recovered, and the refugees were sent back to their hometowns in batches. Currently, only 700-800 refugees from Changting, Ninghua, Qingliu, and Mingxi counties remain, still without homes to return to. Now the relief office is running out of funds, and providing supplies is difficult. They plan to allocate the strong laborers as road construction workers to reduce the burden. (October 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Director Yu's Speech at the Baojia Meeting of Jiangnan Counties <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>To urge all counties under the jurisdiction of Jiangnan and Jiangdu districts to earnestly implement the Baojia system, the Zhenjiang Commissioner's Office and the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department convened county magistrates from various counties in the province in batches on the 20th and 27th of this month to hold Baojia meetings, instructing them on the procedures and methods of implementation. The following is a transcript of Director Yu's speech to the county magistrates present:</p>
<p>First of all, county magistrates, after hearing your reports today, I know that you have a deep understanding and detailed study of the meaning of Baojia and its laws and regulations. Therefore, I know that you do not treat the orders of the Provincial Department as mere formalities, but are determined to implement them. This is something that I am very pleased about.</p>
<p>The meaning of Baojia is already clear to everyone, so I won't repeat it. I would now like to specifically discuss with you the spirit of the Baojia system, as I perceive it. The Baojia system is a local political system passed down from ancient China. It is a grassroots basic organization of local politics. The characteristic of this organization is that it takes the household as the unit. In other words, it takes the family as the unit, which is clearly different from all organizations in Europe and America that take the individual as the unit. The foundation of this organization is the family, and the foundation of this organization is built on ethical kinship. This is the characteristic of the Baojia system, and it is also its spirit. The requirement of the Baojia system is that each household should have a good head of household. A household is a family, and we hope that each family will have a good head of the family to manage the children of the family and not allow bad people to associate with them. Ten households form a Jia, and the Jia has a Jia head. We hope that there will be a good Jia head or good family head within each Jia or ten households to manage the children of these ten households and not allow bad people to associate with them. Ten Jia form a Bao, and the Bao has a Bao head. We hope that there will be a good Bao head or a good family head within each Bao or hundred households to manage the children of these hundred households and not allow them to associate with bad people. The inherent spirit of the Chinese family is most representative of the spirit of Chinese ethics. Most obvious is that the family is rich in the spirit of eliminating violence and maintaining peace, and rich in the spirit of helping those in need. Unfortunately, if an unruly child appears in the city, the head of the family must use family law to punish him. In places where families live together, the clan head can even use his authority to supervise or punish his unfilial children, and even expel them from the clan. This is the spirit of eliminating violence and maintaining peace. Not only that, but the spirit of the family is also full of the spirit of helping those in need. Poor children and impoverished clan members often rely on it to survive. For example, the charity estates and farm fields that exist in history or everywhere now are concrete manifestations of this spirit. What is regrettable is that China has been influenced by modern trends, and even this spirit within the family has gradually disappeared. Therefore, when we implement Baojia, we want to restore this spirit, promote it, and develop it beyond the family, from the family to the nation that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of, which is the principle of regulating the family and governing the country. I feel that the fundamental spirit of Baojia lies entirely in this.</p>
<p>Baojia is a tool, not an end. This tool is a tool for organizing and training the people. Therefore, if Baojia is done well, it means that the people are well organized. When the people are well organized, we can then train the people. When the people are well trained, we can use them however we want. If we want to use them in a passive way, we can use them for self-defense, eliminating violence and maintaining peace, as village police, as local self-defense troops, or as cells of the national defense army. If we want to use them in an active way, we can build roads, develop water conservancy, train the four powers, and carry out all other social or material construction, becoming the basic team for all self-governance undertakings. In recent years, there have been many bandits in various places, and local security sometimes has problems. In addition, the international situation is dangerous, and local self-defense has become a unanimous requirement. Naturally, there is an urgent need for Baojia. Even in terms of self-governance, Jiangsu has been implementing self-governance for several years, but what are the results? Therefore, in order to strive to complete self-governance, we must also quickly implement Baojia and organize this basic tool of self-governance well. Some people mistakenly believe that Jiangsu is implementing Baojia without implementing self-governance. They do not know that Baojia is a tool and self-governance is the goal. We naturally want to implement Baojia for the sake of local self-defense, so as to achieve the goal of self-defense. We want to implement Baojia even more in order to complete local self-governance in Jiangsu, so as to achieve the goal of self-governance. I often find a very strange and dangerous phenomenon in Chinese society, that is, good people are not organized, and good people who are law-abiding are not organized, while bandits have bandit organizations, hooligans have hooligan organizations, and even beggars have beggar organizations. Organization is a kind of power. If good people are not organized, it means that good people have no power. If bad people are organized, it means that bad people have power. How dangerous is this phenomenon! If this continues, without foreigners coming to destroy China, the good people of China will gradually be eliminated by the bad people of China. The use of Baojia is to organize good people, use the power of good people, eliminate the evils of society, and promote the progress of society. Since Baojia is so important, this province decided to implement Baojia this spring, and set progressive steps. The counties under the jurisdiction of the five administrative inspectorates of Tongshan, Hai'an, Huaiyin, Nantong, and Yancheng in Jiangbei will implement it first, followed by the Jiangdu District and the various Jiangnan districts, stipulating that implementation should begin in April. Later, due to various reasons, the progress was slightly delayed (to be continued)</p>

<p>Tragic Incident of Severed Ankle While Watching a Movie</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts of the Second District of our province recently gathered at the local primary school in this county to hold a grand review and camp. The event lasted for three days. Residents of Songjiang flocked to see it, creating a rare grand occasion. Yesterday was the second day of the event. Starting at 7 pm, a movie was shown, attracting many viewers. An elderly woman, Zhang Zhao, who lived in front of the Mo Mansion and made a living as a domestic helper, had never been to a movie theater in her life, due to her lifelong hard work. Taking advantage of this free viewing opportunity, she was invited by a neighbor to go along. Reaching the primary school, just as the movie was being shown, the ground was pitch black. She accidentally stepped into a hole with her right foot, fell to the ground, and was in excruciating pain. The Boy Scouts present, upholding the spirit of rescue, hired a car to take her to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. It was discovered that her right ankle bone was broken. In order to save her life, it was necessary to amputate her right foot in order to have hope of survival. However, the old woman was alone and made a living as a domestic helper. The amputation has not yet been resolved, and her poverty and illness are pitiful.</p>

<p>Wang Baoyuan, a resident of Xita Alley with modest assets, received a threatening letter at the beginning of the month under the name of the "Jiangzhe Iron-Blooded Army." The letter demanded three hundred yuan, instructing Wang to negotiate at the Release Pond, otherwise the whole family's lives would be sacrificed. The case was reported to the Second Police Station. Patrol Officer Lang Xianong, together with the Detective Team Leader, went to the Release Pond, and arrested Yu Yaozhang and Lu Jiuxian, who looked suspicious. A fake gun was found on Lu. They were both sent to the Public Security Bureau and then to the court for investigation. As reported previously, after Yu was arrested, an envelope printed with the words "Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party" was found in his home, matching the threatening letter. After comparing the handwriting, Yu finally confessed and repeatedly claimed that he had been fooled. Today, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution, and Judge Zhang Yihuang of the Criminal Court summoned the case for trial. First, Patrol Officer Lang Xianong of the Second Police Station testified about the arrest. Yu Yaozhang then admitted his guilt without denial, but Lu Jiuxian firmly denied it, and defense lawyer Zhang Bingyuan made a defense. The judge announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled sentencing for the 31st. According to reports, Yu and Lu are both 21 years old and still young. Lu was studying in Shanghai. Lawyer Zhang's request for bail was not granted, and they were both detained.</p>

<p>Patrol Officer Sentenced to Imprisonment for Malfeasance</p>
<p>Chen Hezhen, the daughter of Chen Qinren, the owner of the Chen Fuji store in Zhitang, had an affair with her cousin and absconded to Suzhou with clothes and jewelry. Chen Qinren later found her and handed over both the person and the stolen goods to the Fifth Police Station of this county, requesting legal action. After persuasion from relatives of both families, they reconciled. Zhou Jingming, the patrol officer of the police station, extorted two hundred yuan in bribes, but failed. He then hid a portion of the seized gold jewelry, totaling eight items such as gold hairpins and pearl flowers, and did not hand them over. Chen reported the matter to the county government. After several trials, the sentence has been pronounced, sentencing Zhou Jingming to eight months of imprisonment, suspended for three years, and requiring a cash guarantee of six hundred yuan. Two reputable shops in the city will serve as guarantors. Before guarantors are found, he will remain in the custody of the County Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>Reactions to the National Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>Recently, merchants such as Sun Zicheng have organized a mobile national goods exhibition to promote national goods. They have borrowed the vacant land of the YMCA and built sheds as exhibition venues, inviting various manufacturers to participate in the mobile exhibition, charging each company a rent of thirty yuan, with electricity and advertising costs excluded. They have submitted the plan to the County Party Department for the record, and have hired Cheng Ganqing, a standing committee member of the County Chamber of Commerce, as the chairman, and Xue Yongling, chairman of the Shanghai Foreign Goods Association, as the vice chairman. The opening is scheduled for November 10th. When the members of the Shanghai Foreign Goods Association and the Hangzhou Silk Goods Association heard this news, they believed that Sun and others were using the promotion of national goods as a guise to reap profits and that it would greatly affect the business of various department stores, so they were greatly alarmed. On the evening of the 28th, the members went to Cheng Ganqing's residence to demand justice. Mr. Cheng replied that the goods in the stores were mostly from national goods factories in Shanghai, without distinction, so he had declined the position of chairman. The members then dispersed.</p>

<p>Since the case of Chen Ming, an employee of the Shanghai Bank, embezzling a large sum of money occurred, the detective team here has been paying close attention to suspicious travelers from other places. Gu Wenzao, who lives at No. 12 Jin Si Lane, Huishan Road, Shanghai, used to be a stock exchange worker and is a dissolute young man. He came to Suzhou a few days ago and stayed at No. 48 Sanxin Hotel on Dama Road. He met a prostitute named Wang Xuefang. The two fell in love at first sight and regretted not having met sooner. They had been living together for several nights. Gu spent money like dirt, which was discovered by the detective team, which feared that it was related to the Chen case. They immediately sent detectives to arrest the man and woman and found a deposit book of the Shanghai Pudong Bank for 1,200 yuan. They have been sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The local slaughter tax in this county has been implemented by the tax office since the 16th of this month, collecting taxes at a slightly higher rate. However, pork from rural areas is not allowed to be brought into the urban area, causing opposition from the restaurant and noodle shop industries, who believe that the meat from rural areas has already been taxed for slaughter, but is not allowed to be brought in, and the tax office is deliberately making things difficult, disturbing the market. According to past practice, meat brought from rural areas for personal use within 20 jin was not subject to inspection. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to forward a letter to the County Government, requesting it to order the Slaughter Tax Collection Office to pay special attention, and to allow the free use of meat purchased from rural areas if the invoice and weight match, and not to arbitrarily harass them, so as to stabilize business and prevent disputes.</p>

<p>To the Editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao,</p>
<p>I have read the Changshu communication on page three of your newspaper on October 25th, regarding the electrical dispute which has been satisfactorily resolved. This is not in accordance with the facts. Our factory handles business and has established operating regulations approved by the Construction Committee for implementation. We operate in accordance with the regulations everywhere and there is absolutely no violation. Now reading the communication, it says that our factory has taken back the fire meter and changed it to a rental system, and abolished the comparator fee, etc., which are all based on unfounded rumours. As for the fact that Mr. Guo Zhicheng, Chairman of the Suzhou Electric Association, invited user representatives to talk on the 23rd, it was to explain misunderstandings. After the talk, the association sent a letter to the user representatives, declaring everything, and there were no decision-making methods. For this reason, I am writing to request a correction, and I hope that it will be published in the letter column. I would like to offer my best wishes. Sincerely, Changshu Electric Factory Co., Ltd. 23.10.2</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has announced the new stamp tax law and issued new stamps, which will be implemented on the first of next month. The new tax law differs from the current stamp regulations in several points: 1. Certificates of common acts, such as shipping documents, must be affixed starting from three yuan. 2. Receipts for money are tax-free within three yuan, and one cent is still affixed from three yuan to ten yuan. 3. Invoices for goods priced at more than ten yuan adopt a progressive tax system, with an increase of one cent for every ten yuan, up to a limit of one yuan. 4. Invoices for money increase by one cent for every ten yuan or more.</p>

Tobacco and exchange shops will not be sold. In order to avoid crowding by merchants, the Tax Administration has notified the post offices in this port to start selling them early this morning. However, other ports will still be sold from the first of the month.</p>

<p>Regarding the matter of old stamps being invalidated and not allowed to be used again, after strong efforts by various merchants, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to allow them to be exchanged for new stamps within this year. The Minister has telegraphed Fang Huixian, the chief of the stamp, alcohol and tobacco tax section of the Tax Administration, to go to Beijing to discuss the method. Director Fang has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties, but the method has not yet been decided and is expected to be announced at the beginning of next month.

<p>Commends the China Stone Company</p>
<p>The Minister of Military Administration, He Yingqin, heard that the China Stone Company is a purely domestic stone company, and that the projects it has sent to various places have achieved obvious results and are well-known at home and abroad. Therefore, yesterday, together with Li Dachao, section chief of the municipal government, he drove to the Bazihua Bridge in Zhabei to visit the Shanghai branch of the company. Yao Huasun, the general manager of the company, and Wu Nankai, the factory director, accompanied him to visit various departments, such as sawing, grinding, and refrigeration. He inquired in detail about all aspects of the machines, carving, and manual labor. General Manager Yao explained everything in detail, and he was impressed by the various colors of stone blocks and slabs, which were colorful and stood in various fields, and the beautiful products made could also be ingenious. He nodded frequently and expressed deep appreciation, saying that since domestic products are available, why seek them abroad? He hoped that it would be widely promoted so that the Chinese people would know where to use them, and the future would be very bright. The Minister was in high spirits and very interested that day. He learned that the company not only used completely domestic stone materials, but also all the machinery and labor were created and managed by Chinese people.

<h3 id="e122">Praise for the America-Asia Silk Weaving Factory <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin has been in Shanghai on official business for many days. He has always paid attention to industrial production, and he has spared no effort in encouraging the domestic goods production industry. He has been extremely busy visiting domestic goods factories for several days. Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Li Dachao, the chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, he visited the America-Asia Silk Weaving Factory. He was personally received by Cai Shengbai, the general manager of the factory. Mr. He greatly praised the factory and wrote the nine characters "Chinese people should use Chinese goods." According to what he told reporters, in promoting domestic goods clothing, in addition to cloth, silk should also be actively promoted. China is a silk-producing country, and in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, hundreds of thousands of people rely on silk for a living. If it is not used freely in the country, it will have a real impact on the livelihoods of farmers. The influx of foreign silk into North China is especially something that factories like the America-Asia Silk Factory should use to promote domestic silk in large quantities to recover lost profits.</p>

<p>According to the National News Agency in this city, it was recently announced by the spokesman of the Central Bank that, according to reliable sources, the suggestion of Minister of Finance Kong for the Foreign Exchange Market Equalization Committee has been ordered to the Customs to allow those who transport silver for export to pay the equalization tax to be levied on the day of customs declaration (that is, those who transport silver for export can avoid the difficulty of not being able to predict the amount of tax to be paid). According to this method, one can prove the government's sole will to prevent silver from being transported for export due to speculation, and two can prove that the government still maintains its silver standard system for the Chinese monetary system, and three can allow banks to offset their positions when necessary in foreign exchange. According to the spokesman, Minister of Finance Kong also instructed the Customs to not levy additional taxes and dredging fees on the tax when collecting the equalization tax.</p>

<p>The Ningjing Also Ran Aground in Shashi</p>
<p>The Tongde Wheel of the Tongde Company is managed by the Dafang Company on Hankou Road in this city. On the 27th of this month, it loaded 3,800 shuns of Fuyuan coal from the Tongzhangpu area downstream of Hankou and came to Shanghai. The journey was safe. When the ship arrived in Tongzhou on the night of the 28th, there was fog in Jiangxi. Due to careless leading of the river, the ship entered a shallow sandbank and ran aground. Although the shipowner tried every means to reverse the engine to escape, the water on the beach was too shallow, and the Tongde Wheel could not drive out because it was heavily loaded. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Shanghai to report the incident and request rescue. The company has consulted with the British Taikoo Company and requested that the Huangpu Wheel, which left Shanghai upstream on the 27th, should help tow the ship when it arrives in Tongzhou. Taikoo has agreed and has sent a telegram to the owner of the Huangpu ship to help rescue it.</p>
<p>In addition, the Yongsheng and Yunlong salt transport ships that ran aground in Shashi have sent telegrams saying that the Yongsheng Wheel has cleared the salt and been rescued from the shoal, and will be repaired in Shanghai immediately. The Yunlong Wheel is still stranded on the shoal in Shashi. The Ningshao Company's Ningjing Wheel also transported salt from Haizhou to Sha this time. Because the ship was large and the water was shallow, it also ran aground. The two ships are unloading the salt in the ship before being towed.</p>

<p>Commissioners Chen and Luo Will Attend Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously stated that although the Civil Law Debt Article already has provisions for the responsibility of withdrawing from a partnership, there are no provisions for whether to add, change, or publish announcements after withdrawing from a partnership. Therefore, there have been disputes from time to time that have not been resolved for a long time. After a resolution was passed by the general meeting of members, it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan to formulate a commercial registration law so that the Civil Law Debt Management even has a layer of responsibility for currency, with room for adjustment and remedy. The Legislative Yuan replied and handed it over to the Commercial Law Committee to draft. It is now known that the drafting has been completed and will be held in Beijing on October 31st to review it. Yesterday, the association specially sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting to send representatives to attend and express their opinions. The association has appointed Chen Zheqing and Luo Qingten. The two commissioners will go to Beijing tomorrow to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>Banks Can Still Submit Opinions If They Have Any</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Bank Law Research Committee organized by the Bankers Association held its second meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 pm. All members attended, chaired by Xu Shenting. They continued to study the opinions put forward by the local Bankers Associations and various banks in this city, and combined them so that they could be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Legislative Yuan for adoption. In order to gather wisdom and benefit, the Bankers Association has further clarified the opinions of the local Bankers Associations and asked them to send their supplementary opinions to the Association within ten days so that they can be submitted for discussion. If the various banks in this city continue to have opinions, they can also submit them to the meeting within five days. The committee will conclude within two weeks and report the results of the research to the Executive Committee of the Xihang Public Association. It is reported that there are a total of 52 articles in the Bank Law. Article 5 stipulates that shareholders should bear double responsibility. All parties believe that it should be deleted. The old Bank Savings Law also had this provision, but it was deleted by the Bankers Association when it was discussed in the Legislative Yuan. Article 10 stipulates that banks shall not be shareholders of other companies, and it is believed that there is also a need for common methods in implementation. If shops and companies managed by banks due to mortgage loans are not allowed to continue operating, they will inevitably suffer losses. Therefore, it is hoped that there will be remedial measures in the implementation. There are many other opinions put forward by various parties, and it will take many meetings to draft a whole opinion.</p>

<p>1. Regarding the proposal to appoint representatives to the joint meeting of the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees to review the Commercial Registration Law. Case: The association previously received letters and telegrams from various chambers of commerce stating that Article 681 of the Civil Law "Joint and several liability for partnership debts" is not average in terms of rights and obligations. The association forwarded it to the conference for amendments. The association repeatedly telegraphed the Legislative Yuan to request amendments. Later, the secretariat of the Legislative Yuan replied that the article does not need to be amended and that a commercial registration law will be formulated in the future to provide assistance. The association then telegraphed the Legislative Yuan again, requesting that personnel be allowed to attend the meeting when the commercial registration law is amended. Yesterday, the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan sent a letter stating that the drafting of the commercial registration law has been completed and will be submitted for review at 9:00 am on the 31st of this month.

<p>2. Regarding the proposal to have various chambers of commerce oppose the old stamp tax being registered in stages. Case: The association previously received a bulletin from the Ministry of Finance stating that new stamp tax tickets will be issued starting from November 1 this year, and the old stamp tax tickets will be invalidated at the same time. Subsequently, the association received letters and telegrams from various chambers of commerce requesting that the old stamps continue to be valid or that the old stamps be allowed to be used with the new stamps. The association repeatedly telegraphed the Central National Government and ministries to request. Later, the Ministry of Finance replied that considering the difficulties of business, if the old stamps have not been used up by November 1, a registration method will be determined to exchange them in stages. After the association notified, it received letters and telegrams from various chambers of commerce, either opposing the registration method, requesting that the old and new stamps continue to be used together, requesting an advance one-time exchange, or requesting the speedy determination of the registration method. How should it be handled? It is proposed to the Standing Committee for discussion and awaits a public decision. Resolved: Submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to determine the registration and exchange method as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Please Amend the Stamp Law <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>3. Regarding the proposal of various chambers of commerce to oppose the increased tax rates on invoices, leaflets, receipts, and ticket taxes under the Stamp Tax Law. Case: The association previously received letters and telegrams from various chambers of commerce stating that the temporary example of the Stamp Tax is harsh and incomplete, and requested that a stamp tax implementation law be formulated. The association repeatedly forwarded it to the Legislative Yuan, requesting it to be on file. Subsequently, on the 12th of this month, the 73rd meeting of the Legislative Yuan encountered the Stamp Tax Law, and although the starting point for stamping invoices, bills, and receipts was changed from one yuan to three yuan, it became a progressive method, from two cents to one yuan, which is 50 times more. Various chambers of commerce have requested to forward the amendments. The association has already telegraphed the Legislative Yuan twice, but many chambers of commerce continue to request it. Should it be telegraphed again? It is proposed to the Standing Committee for discussion and awaits a public decision. Resolved: Collect the opinions of various chambers of commerce and submit them to the Legislative Yuan to request amendments.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Promote the Organization of Provincial Chambers of Commerce <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>4. Regarding the proposal on how to promote the reorganization of chambers of commerce and the establishment of provincial federations of chambers of commerce. Case: The association previously failed to meet the statutory number of provincial federations of chambers of commerce and municipal chambers of commerce due to the reorganization, so the requests for reorganization were repeatedly ordered to maintain the status quo. Therefore, the association has been delayed and has not been reorganized to this day. The association has temporarily urged the reorganization of the various chambers of commerce and repeatedly telegraphed them, but most of them have not been completed. The association distributed a questionnaire in April of this year to investigate the reasons why the various chambers of commerce failed to reorganize. Subsequently, the various chambers of commerce filled out and returned the questionnaires to the association. The summary of the key points is that the reorganization of the chambers of commerce must be in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law, the Public Association Law, and the Regulations on the Organization of People's Organizations. The procedures are very complicated, and the merchants and people in the interior have less knowledge and cannot understand them, resulting in invisible stagnation. The association then formulated the organizational procedures for trade associations, chambers of commerce, and federations of chambers of commerce, printed them into a booklet, and distributed them to the national chambers of commerce for reference. Currently, there are 28 provinces in the country. Excluding Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol for the time being, there are still 24 provinces and 5 special municipalities, totaling 29 units. According to Article 37 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, two-thirds should have 20 units to meet the statutory number. Currently, there are only three provincial federations of chambers of commerce in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangxi, and only four municipal chambers of commerce in Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, and Qingdao have fully legal organizations. The rest are not sound and are far from the statutory number. How should we find ways to promote the reorganization of various chambers of commerce and the establishment of provincial federations of chambers of commerce? It is proposed to the Standing Committee for discussion and awaits a public decision. Resolved: Submit a request to the Ministry of Industry to urge the provinces that have not yet organized to reorganize quickly.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations inaugurated the fourth freight training class. The director addressed the audience, stating that the administration had organized three sessions in Shanghai to host representatives from various companies, factories, and stores, explaining railway freight procedures and providing tours of railway freight operations. Due to the enthusiastic participation of these businesses, a fourth session was planned. However, this will be the last session held in Shanghai, as future sessions will be conducted in Nanjing and Hangzhou to ensure balanced coverage. The director emphasized that the purpose of the freight training classes has been explained at the opening of each of the previous three sessions. While the specific content varied, the ultimate goal remained the same. At the inauguration of the fourth session, he summarized the previous points and presented two key objectives: Firstly, from the perspective of the entire production industry, the administration's involvement in these freight matters encompasses three aspects. From the railway's standpoint, both production and sales represent shippers. Legal regulations govern the relationship between railways and freight merchants, but merchants often find them complex and difficult to understand. In the past, the railway may not have sufficiently ensured that merchants fully understood these regulations. Therefore, the administration, to demonstrate its sincerity in cooperation, specifically invites merchants to learn about the freight handling procedures and calculation methods used by the railway, revealing all details and encouraging them to visit stations and freight yards for on-site observation to eliminate misunderstandings and facilitate collaboration. This is the fundamental purpose of the administration's freight training classes, to promote national economic development based on fairness and mutual benefit. Secondly, every enterprise should have an organizational structure to thrive. This structure can be divided into three aspects: the organization of the enterprise itself, such as the internal organization of a company or factory, or industry associations. Another is the organization of related enterprises, such as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Considering the three aspects of production, transportation, and sales, each individual sector already has a well-established organization. Vertically, production and sales also have substantial organization, but there is no adequate organization linking production, transportation, and sales. Therefore, the administration promotes cooperation among these three sectors and proposes establishing a joint organization. For example, in stations with particularly developed freight operations, the administration intends to convene a committee comprising shippers from both the production and sales sides, along with railway representatives, to jointly inspect freight operations regularly. This proposal has already been approved by the Ministry of Railways. In addition, the administration envisions a club-like organization to foster communication and exchange ideas among the three sectors. After the completion of this final freight training session in Shanghai, the administration plans to convene all the companies, factories, and stores that have participated in previous sessions to discuss implementation. This is the administration's major hope for the freight training classes, and it seeks the continued support and guidance of everyone involved.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Central Committee Member Wang Qi Discusses Art Movement <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Central Committee Member Wang Qi arrived in Shanghai to prepare for his personal calligraphy and painting exhibition. Yesterday, a reporter visited his residence and inquired about his views on the art movement. Wang Qi stated that he believes the art industry is essential for the survival of the nation and state. Human evolution relies on shared intellectual capacity to create culture and improve society, meeting the needs of both the present and future generations. Westerners refer to humans as rational animals, distinguished from other creatures by their noble character, refined lifestyle, and ability to socialize and share this lifestyle. This lifestyle should have both internal (spiritual) and external (material) aspects, which are interdependent and mutually supportive. Overemphasis on one aspect leads to imbalance and deficiency, preventing the formation of a fulfilling life. In recent times, human desires have run rampant, with an extreme tendency towards material life, resulting in corruption and deterioration. During this period of national crisis, people should uplift their spirits, cultivate noble characters, and engage in social reform. Satisfying basic needs like food, clothing, shelter, and transportation is essential, but moral education is even more critical. Wang Qi has no personal hobbies and spends his free time studying calligraphy and painting, albeit with limited achievements. He has joined many art and literary organizations over the years. Last year, he and other art professionals in Beijing initiated the Chinese Art Association, including Zhang Ji, Yu Youren, Chen Shuren, Jing Tinggu, Zhang Dao藩, Yu Jingtang, Hong Ludong, Liang Dingming, Tang Wenting, and professors from National Central University like Li Yishi, Chen Zhifo, Pan Yuliang, and Zhang Shuqi, as well as professors from Nanjing Art School like Gao Xishun and Zhang Yiran. Chen Guofu and Chen Lifu strongly supported the initiative. Recently, Xu Beihong returned from Europe and joined the association. The association's purpose is to unite the national art community in promoting art and cultural movements, revitalizing Chinese art and literature while advocating new ideas and building new enterprises, without any distinction between the old and the new. A commemorative exhibition was held in Beijing a month ago, showcasing a wide range of works, including paintings, calligraphy, sculptures, and industrial arts. Members from various fields contributed exhibits, including Wang Yachen, Zhang Yuguang, Zhu Xianyun, Zhu Qizhan, and Cheng Zhenxia from Shanghai, many of whom attended the event. The association originally planned to establish branches in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hangzhou, which are currently underway. Wang Qi also intends to facilitate some connections during this trip.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Lake Society Letter to County Magistrates in the Lake Region <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Encouraging Spring Planting: Supplementing Agricultural Production</p>
<p>The Lake Society of this city, recognizing the severe drought and resulting crop failure in the Lake region, has sent letters to the six county magistrates in the region, urging them to encourage spring planting to remedy the situation. The letter states: "Regarding the fact that our six counties in the Lake region have suffered from drought for months since the summer, with scorching sun and parched land, despite all efforts to mitigate the effects, the rivers and canals have dried up, dashing all hopes. Farmers, already struggling with years of poor harvests, have no surplus grain, and starvation is widespread. Our society, deeply concerned about this plight, has joined forces with fellow natives in Shanghai to establish the Lake Region Disaster Relief Committee, seeking aid to provide some relief. However, in this time of economic decline and widespread poverty, the funds raised are likely limited and may not last until next spring. With the Double Ninth Festival passed and Minor Spring approaching, recent rainfall has slightly moistened the land, making it not too late to sow spring crops. Although it may be a small effort, it can still supplement agricultural production. No land should be left uncultivated, as the people's livelihood depends on hard work. We cannot afford to let disaster halt daily activities and simply wait for death. Therefore, we specifically request that Your Excellency, the County Magistrate, promptly issue proclamations, explaining the benefits of spring planting to prevent idleness and lead to wrongdoings. Please also instruct the district chiefs to widely promote and supervise the planting efforts. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Disaster Reports from Various Regions: Begging for Relief and Urgent Appeals - Haining <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>This year's drought is the worst among the counties in the Jiangnan region, affecting over 300,000 people in the entire county. Recently, local charitable organizations such as the Jisheng Society, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Bodhi Dharma Society, and the Red Swastika Society have jointly provided emergency relief. After strict verification by the county government, the number of people in need of assistance still exceeds 140,000. However, due to the vast area affected, the total amount of emergency relief funds is only around 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, which is only enough to provide food for a few days. Therefore, for a widespread relief effort, providing work in exchange for wages is essential. Mr. Feng Liutang, a standing committee member of the Haining County Drought Relief Association, proposed repairing the Sixty Black Pond River and organizing work projects along the coast. A meeting was convened at the Gongdelin Office in Shanghai to discuss this proposal. The participants unanimously agreed that the Sixty Li Pond River in Haining, which connects to the Shangtang River in the west, encircles the county seat, and ends at Huangwan in the east, is located in the southern part of the county and is at a high elevation. In the past, frequent storm surges caused breaches in the riverbanks, leading to sediment deposition and eventual blockage. As a result, irrigation of farmland on both banks suffered, and sixty li of transportation was cut off. Previous proposals to repair the river were never implemented. The river is crucial for the farmland and water resources in the southern part of the county, and the average annual grain production in the area along the river is less than half of what it used to be due to the blockage and lack of dredging. Therefore, the participants decided that the river repair project is essential for providing work relief. However, due to the large scale and high cost of the project, it cannot be undertaken without substantial funding from the government through public bonds. It has been reported that the association has sent a letter to the county government, requesting a prompt estimate of the project costs and submitting it to the provincial government, urging them to consider the severity of the disaster in Haining County, which is unparalleled compared to other counties, and approve the allocation of funds for the work relief project as a priority.</p>

<p>Yuqian County, located on the border of western Zhejiang under the jurisdiction of Hangzhou, encompasses the West Tianmu Mountain within its boundaries. The county is predominantly mountainous with limited farmland, making it naturally barren. In years of good harvests, the yield barely covers the population's needs. Since the beginning of summer this year, the county has experienced continuous drought for nearly three months. The soil has cracked, and the crops have withered. After autumn, heavy rain fell, reviving the withered crops. However, due to the sudden cold weather, the revived seedlings withered again, resulting in a complete crop failure. According to investigations by the Central Relief Commission, the degree of damage far exceeds ninety percent, with disaster victims accounting for over seventy percent of the county's population. Those without rice to cook use paper mulberry leaves, bitter vegetables, and mountain grains to fill their stomachs. The suffering is unbearable, and reports of suicides due to hardship are frequent. Mr. Shen Naigeng, the county magistrate, along with local representatives, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and has been visiting leaders of various relief organizations, reporting on the disaster situation and requesting immediate assistance to alleviate the suffering of the disaster victims.</p>

<p>An Appeal to Kindhearted Benefactors at Home and Abroad from the Shen Bao Newspaper: In the reigns of Yao and Tang, there were floods and droughts, yet the people did not suffer from cold or hunger. During the famines and epidemics in the states of Su and Zhao, the descendants did not worry about displacement. Alas, our Langxi region is afflicted by drought, with calamities descending from the heavens. For three months, there has been no rain, causing sorrow for the hundred thousand people. Thirty-eight thousand acres of fertile land have seen their crops wither. Ninety-six villages are suffering, with people displaying a wretched appearance. Some are wandering, some are displaced, some are hungry, and some are thirsty, resembling emaciated birds, filling the air with laments. Ditches, canals, and rivers have all cracked. Rural areas are declining, and people cannot even obtain a single bowl of gruel. Bandits are rampant, and the crisis is further compounded by widespread robberies of grain. There are reports of selling wives and children, causing painful separations that resemble lingering deaths. The plight of refugees depicted by Zheng Xia is now evident in Langxi. We issue passionate appeals, seeking assistance from those in authority. We had hoped for a bountiful autumn harvest, but the crops have withered. We had expected relief from the spring famine, but now winter is approaching, which is even more difficult to endure. An investigation of the population in each district reveals a shortage of over three hundred thousand dan of grain. Statistics show that less than twenty percent of the land in the entire county has yielded a small harvest, while the rest is barren. Now, the eastern crops have failed, with withered branches and leaves. It is to be feared that the western crops will also be disappointing. How can we collect salt taxes and pay for goods? There is no way to provide relief from the famine. We earnestly appeal to you to have compassion for the disaster victims, provide abundant provisions, and generously distribute relief funds. It is also requested that both work relief and winter relief be provided concurrently, and that both grain relief and financial aid be offered equally. It is said that providing shade with the leaves of a large tree is akin to creating a dense canopy, and reducing a spoonful of water from the Yangtze River is akin to creating a healing balm. Giving the disaster victims a chance to live is like granting them a new life. We earnestly request you to provide more assistance, which will save more lives. The Disaster Relief Committee, Finance Committee, Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, Education Association, and Civil Food Relief Committee respectfully bow three times in gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department Suggesting Improvements to Traffic Issues <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining Streetcars and Preventing Parallel Operation with Buses</p>
<p>Ensuring Citizen Safety and Handling Vehicle Accidents According to Law</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding the frequent traffic accidents that have occurred within the First Special District in recent years, jeopardizing the safety of citizens. For ordinary vehicles, strict inspections and penalties ensure that drivers are cautious beforehand and that compensation is provided afterward, maintaining a balance. However, public buses, due to the involvement of multiple parties, face leniency in inspections and often avoid responsibility for accidents. As a result, drivers become reckless and negligent, further compromising citizen safety. We have seen reports that your Traffic Committee has been discussing traffic issues in the district. While various proposals have been made, we believe that further detailed and thorough consideration is necessary. As a representative of taxpayers, our association has gathered public opinion and reached the following conclusions: 1. All efforts should consider local conditions and adapt to local needs, rather than simply following foreign examples. 2. Streetcars should be maintained, and the Public Works Department should take over their operation when the concession expires. 3. Public buses should not operate on the same routes as streetcars, and the buses should be smaller, similar to those used in the Second District. Double-decker buses should not be allowed to operate on busy roads. 4. The safety of citizens should be fully guaranteed. All vehicles, whether public or private, should be subject to legal proceedings in case of accidents, without exception. If found guilty, the vehicle owner should bear civil liability, and the Public Works Department should provide assistance, such as revoking licenses. We hope that you will consider these suggestions and take appropriate action."</p>

<p>Assistance to Patriots Association Sends Letter to Suzhou Fellow-Provincials Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Assistance Patriotic People Association sent a letter to the Suzhou Fellow-Provincials Association yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding the patriotic person Pan Hongsheng, who, along with Liu Chongwu, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, and others, angered by the shamelessness of treacherous merchants, was driven by patriotic fervor to disregard everything and throw bombs to warn the merchants, leading to his arrest. Details of the situation have been reported in various newspapers, which you are likely aware of. However, Pan Hongsheng's condition in prison is critical due to illness. At the request of his family, our association has engaged Mr. Ma Junxiang as a lawyer to provide pro bono legal assistance. He has been released on bail for medical treatment and is receiving care at Xianghua Hospital. Pan Hongsheng's ancestral home is in Suzhou, which makes him a fellow native of your association. We are informing you of this matter. Today's newspaper reports that Liu Chongwu is from Danyang and is receiving continued assistance from the Danyang Fellow-Provincials Association. Cao Songshou and Tian Shuiyang are from Shaoxing and are also receiving assistance from their respective hometown associations. This matter concerns hometown ties, and we urge your association to provide strong support to fulfill your responsibility to your fellow native."</p>

<p>Result: Seized Rickshaw Licenses Returned, Deadline Set for Replacement</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners Claim It's Difficult to Comply, Will Continue to Fight</p>
<p>Rickshaw owners affected by the Public Works Department's Fairness Road Rickshaw Inspection Office's forced replacement of rickshaw licenses and new rickshaws, led by Te Zheng Biao, Yan Zheng Bao, Liang Yu Hua, Le He Lin, Zhu Xue Cheng, Tang Guang Liang, Ren Lu Qi, Jin Chun Lin, Xue Zhang Pei Hua, Chu Lian Gui, Zhao Rong Fu, Xue Zheng Ji, and over sixty others, went to the Rickshaw Committee at 10:00 AM yesterday to petition. They elected Jin Chun Lin, Xue Zheng Ji, and Zhao Rong Fu as representatives to meet with Committee Chairman Massey and members Zhu Mao Cheng and Wang Zhi Ren. They requested the issuance of licenses and expressed their inability to accept the new rickshaws. The Rickshaw Committee ordered the head of the Inspection Office to attend for questioning regarding the unauthorized seizure of licenses and forced removal of seals, deeming it inappropriate. According to reporters from Xin Sheng News, licenses have been forcibly removed from six rickshaw groups, and over eighty rickshaws have been ordered to be replaced with new ones within one month. However, based on the eighth resolution of the Rickshaw Owners Committee's meeting on August 6, the new public rickshaw design should be based on the practical suggestions of rickshaw pullers and other relevant parties and can only be implemented after all parties agree. This was approved by the Public Works Department Board of Directors on August 7. The forced replacement without the consent of all parties has caused great dissatisfaction among the rickshaw owners. At 2:00 PM, the six seized licenses were returned. The owners were given one month to replace all rickshaws with new ones to standardize them. However, the rickshaw owners claim that replacing all rickshaws with the new design within one month is impossible and that the new design is impractical. They have vowed to continue their fight.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Pudong Water Plant to Begin Operation in April Next Year <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Industrial Development Society Plans to Submit Proposal</p>
<p>To the Municipal Government for Approval and Construction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Development Trust Society, after receiving instructions from the Municipal Government to actively prepare for the Pudong Water Plant, immediately began designing the project. The society recognized the vast area of Pudong and its unlimited potential for future development. Therefore, the water plant was planned based on two principles: 1. To ensure widespread water supply to the entire region; 2. To keep water prices as low as possible. Based on these principles, the water plant's maximum daily water supply capacity must be 13,636.5 cubic meters (approximately 3 million gallons) to meet the needs. The plant site must occupy at least 15 mu (approximately 2.5 acres). Therefore, the initial design was carefully considered to avoid future difficulties in expansion due to land constraints. The inability of the old Zhabei Water Plant to expand, leading to the construction of a new plant, serves as a cautionary tale. The society had to find a way to expedite the water plant's operation. After careful research, it came up with two options: a formal water plant and a temporary water plant. The formal water plant would be larger in scale and take approximately one year to complete. The temporary water plant would be built on public land in Pudong, consisting of a water storage pool. It would adopt a water purchase and transfer method, using water tankers to purchase clean water from the water plant, taking advantage of the night-time ferry downtime to transport the water. Electric centrifugal pumps would then pump the water into the storage pool, where it would be further disinfected. This method is expected to deliver water by April next year at the latest. The society has submitted this plan to the Municipal Government for review and approval.</p>

After a thorough investigation by the High Court, the presiding judge, accompanied by the prosecutor, visited the scene of the crime. Following deliberations by the collegiate panel, a date was set for the pronouncement of the verdict, as reported extensively in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, on the day of the verdict, the appellants Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, along with the plaintiff, Zhou Jinggeng, and their respective defense attorneys Lin Yingqing, E Sen, Li Guozhen, and Yan Yinwu, arrived at the court to await the decision. The Police Department was represented by attorney Yuan Jiahuang. At 2:30 PM, Judge Guo Dezhang (presiding over the case as acting presiding judge in place of Judge Sun Honglin, who was on leave visiting relatives in his hometown of Jing) and Judges Zhang Chaozuo and Li Shouyi, together with Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, convened a special session of the Third Criminal Court. The four appellants, Zhang, Zhuang, Wang, and Tang, were brought before the court, and after a brief questioning, the verdict was read aloud, dismissing the appeal. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Zhou Jinggeng, was brought before the court, and the verdict dismissing the accompanying civil appeal was announced. After the verdicts were read, the court briefly explained their meaning and informed the four appellants that they would remain on their original bail during the period for appealing to the Third Instance Court.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Jiang-Zhejiang Water Police Brigade Cracks Down on Fishermen's Provocations <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Jiang-Zhejiang Water Police Brigade has issued a public notice stating that, according to reports from fishery associations, fishermen's trade associations, and the Renhe, Linghe, and Jinghe Public Offices, every fishing season, fishermen from various regions gather to fish in the Jiang-Zhejiang waters. However, some individuals, whose character is questionable, resort to barbaric acts such as seizing nets, dragging people, and extorting money upon encountering other boats. Some even sail into the ocean without their own fishing gear, intentionally provoking others under the cover of darkness, seizing their nets for their own gain. This not only harms others and benefits themselves, obstructing fishing, but is also tantamount to robbery under the guise of fishing. If not suppressed, the future of fishing is unimaginable. Therefore, a joint petition was submitted, urgently requesting the issuance of an order to stop these actions and requesting that coastal military and police agencies pay close attention to eliminate these miscreants and maintain the fishing industry. In response, the Water Police Brigade has determined that the actions of fishermen who use pretexts to provoke others and drag people are in violation of the law. If such actions are not strictly suppressed, the fishing industry cannot be maintained and public safety cannot be ensured. Based on the aforementioned reports, the Brigade, in addition to ordering its ships to pay attention to preventing such incidents, hereby issues a public notice to all fishermen, informing them that if any incidents of obstructing the fishing industry occur in the future, they will be arrested and prosecuted without leniency. Everyone must strictly comply. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Red Pill Manufacturing Den Broken Up on Xujiahui Road <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Boss Arrested in Dahua Apartments</p>
<p>Approved for a Seven-Day Extension for Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>Jin Jiulin, the detective inspector of the French Police, and detective Jiang Changwen recently learned that there was a private red pill manufacturing operation at No. 71 Heng Deli, Xing Street, Xujiahui Road. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at around 4:00 PM, they led detectives Dai Ronggu, Jin Bingwen, Geng Quanchang, and others to the manufacturing site, where they arrested a woman from Jiangbei named Zhang Wu (36 years old). They confiscated red pill manufacturing equipment such as red pill boards, ovens, sieves, wooden basins, cloth bags, and three large foreign lead skin boxes used for storing materials. They took her to the police station. According to her confession, the boss, Cao Runmin, 34 years old, from Guizhou, lived in Room 9, Dahua Apartments, Bo Bai Road. The detectives immediately went to the Dahua Apartments, arrested Cao, and seized 15 small packets of morphine, 420 red pills, and a set of smoking paraphernalia from the room. They were taken back to the police station and, along with Zhang, were taken to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District yesterday. Judge Xiong Huiping interrogated them. The police attorney, Fei Xizhen, explained the case and requested a seven-day extension for a detailed investigation before filing charges. The seized evidence was submitted to the court. Detective Dai Rongji reported on the process of solving the case. The court verified the information and interrogated the defendants. The request for an extension until November 2nd for further investigation and interrogation was approved. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Stealing a Gun to Plot Murder <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Arrested Before the Deed Could Be Done</p>
<p>Debate Concluded, Date Set for Pronouncement</p>
<p>Wang Taoji, a 23-year-old rickshaw puller from Tongzhou, often parked his rickshaw at the entrance of Meilan Lane on Belle Road in the French Concession. He became acquainted with Gu Pei, the watchman of the lane, and often stayed in the watchman's small wooden booth. Wang had a long-standing grudge against Jiang Shijin, a 28-year-old fellow townsman who lived at No. 5, Lane 103, Xinqiao Road in the Chinese area and had previously worked as a detective in the Public Security Bureau. Wang had repeatedly thought of ways to harm Jiang, but lacked the means to do so. One day, Wang saw that the watchman was wearing a handgun issued by the police station. On the evening of September 22nd, while Gu Pei was on duty, Wang stole the handgun and six bullets that were hanging in the small wooden booth. He hid them on his person and fled. Gu discovered the theft and reported it to the French Police, requesting an arrest. After stealing the handgun, Wang invited Jiang Shibiao to meet him in the wilderness of Bazibiao, Zhabei. He intended to shoot Jiang, but Jiang was unaware of Wang's sinister intentions. He invited his fellow townsman, Dai Xiaojin, a 23-year-old rickshaw puller who lived at No. 15, Deren Lane, Guohuo Road in the southern city, to accompany him to Bazibiao, Zhabei. While they were talking, a police detective from the Public Security Bureau arrived on patrol and found Wang and the others suspicious. They searched them and found the handgun and bullets on Wang's person. Wang, Jiang, and Dai were taken to the police station and transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation. After learning of the incident, the French Police reported it to the Second Special District Court and requested that detectives be dispatched to the Local Court to transfer Wang, Dai, and Jiang, along with the handgun, to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The handgun and bullets were returned to Gu Pei. Yesterday morning, Judge Tai Yangping interrogated them in the First Criminal Court. The police attorney, Fei Xizhen, explained the police investigation and charged Wang Taoji with attempted murder and theft under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. Dai Xiaojin and Jiang Shibiao were charged with suspicion of theft. Wang Taoji confessed to stealing the handgun and intending to kill Jiang. Dai and Jiang both testified that they were unaware of Wang Taoji's theft of the handgun. After a lengthy investigation, the court declared the debate closed and set the pronouncement for the 30th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Lewd Monk's Bestial Behavior <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>A Friend's Daughter Grossly Violated</p>
<p>The Law Should Impose Severe Sanctions</p>
<p>The lewd monk Yang Tang, originally from Gaoyou, is currently 38 years old. He was formerly a monk at the Baiyun Temple, but because he had not cleansed his six senses and failed to abide by the monastic rules, he was expelled by the abbot. He now resides upstairs in the waiting room at No. 224, North Fujian Road, and thus became acquainted with Miao Yaoting, a tenant from Taizhou who lives in the porter's lodge of the house. Recently, the monk suddenly moved to No. 157 nearby. At around 3:00 PM on the 20th of this month, Hui Tang visited Miao Yaoting for a chat. Upon entering Miao's room, he found that Miao and his wife, Gu, had gone out and had not yet returned. Only their ten-year-old daughter, A Bao, was left in the room to watch the door. Hui Tang looked around and, seeing no one, was overcome with lust. He suddenly became extremely bold, closed the door, took out fifteen copper coins from his pocket as bait, gave them to A Bao, and embraced her. First, he played with the girl's lower body with his fingers. Then, driven by sexual desire, he forcibly raped her. A Bao was an ignorant child and, of course, had no strength to resist. A Bao did not dare to say anything. But Hui Tang was a lewd monk who, because he did not abide by the monastic rules, was fond of engaging in licentious activities, and thus contracted a venereal disease. After committing adultery with the girl once, the symptoms of leucorrhea were transmitted to her. For several days, the girl not only walked unsteadily, but her underwear was also covered in white spots and bloody stains. Her mother became suspicious and questioned her severely. Only then did she tell the truth about being raped by the monk. Upon hearing this, Miao and his wife were enraged and knew that the so-called monk must be Hui Tang. At 8:45 PM the night before last, they went to Hui Tang's residence to confront him. In his desperation, he swallowed a small amount of opium, hoping to commit suicide, and fled into the street. Miao then called Chinese Constable No. 2647, who arrived and took Hui Tang to the Huisih Police Station. The young girl, Miao A Bao, was sent to Guangren Hospital, where it was confirmed that her hymen had been ruptured and that she had contracted leucorrhea and would need to be hospitalized for treatment. A medical certificate was issued and brought back to the police station by the detectives. Under questioning, Hui Tang initially admitted to playing with his fingers but denied rape. However, a medical certificate from the Tongsheng Pharmacy found on his person revealed that he had indeed suffered from leucorrhea and had gone to the pharmacy to seek treatment for five dollars, which had not yet been cured. Hui Tang was sent to Tongren and Patrol Police Hospitals for examinations, which confirmed that he had leucorrhea. Both hospitals issued certificates as evidence. Therefore, yesterday morning, the police first brought Hui Tang to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District and charged him with rape under Article 240, Paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code. The police attorney, Zhang Tianyin, explained the above situation and requested an adjournment because the victim, Miao A Bao, was still in the hospital and could not be present in court today. Judge Wu ruled that, because the case involved public morals, spectators were prohibited from attending. As a result, the case was adjourned for seven days for further hearing. The defendant, Hui Tang, was ordered to undergo a forensic examination before being taken back to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Thugs Suddenly Use Nitric Acid to Disfigure Ji Xiangyun <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>No Grudges, Yet This Cruel Act</p>
<p>Request for Adjournment to Conduct Investigation</p>
<p>Ji Xiangyun, a native of Wuxi and the owner of the Fengyi Printing House located at No. 1299, Siwen Lane, Datong Road, was tricked into coming out at 8:05 AM on the 27th of this month. Nearby, two people poured glasses filled with nitric acid on him, causing severe injuries to his head, neck, arms, and other parts of his body. One of the assailants was apprehended on the spot by Chinese Constable No. 961 and taken to the Xin Zha Police Station for detention. Ji Xiangyun was immediately taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police took the perpetrator to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police charged him with causing serious injury under Article 294 of the Criminal Code. The police attorney, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, saying that after the defendant was brought to the police station by the patrol police, Chinese and Western detectives questioned him. He claimed his name was Guo Yongzhang, a 22-year-old from Guangdong, and that he committed the act because Ji Xiangyun had an affair with his wife. The detectives investigated the claim and discovered that it was entirely false, as Guo was not married. After repeated questioning, Guo confessed that the idea came from Li Aju, who was at large. Li had a long-standing feud with Ji and, for revenge, recruited Zhang Xinglong and Guo. They first discussed the plan at the Tianchan Tea House on Xizang Road, deciding to disfigure Ji's face with nitric acid. At around 8:00 AM on the morning of the incident, Li Aju waited outside Ji's door with a glass of nitric acid. Zhang and Guo broke into Ji's home and falsely claimed that a Mr. Zhou from Rehe Road wanted to discuss an important matter with Ji, urging him to come immediately. When Ji arrived, Guo and Li poured the nitric acid on his face, disfiguring him. Guo was then arrested. Upon hearing this confession, the police questioned Ji Xiangyun. Ji stated that he did not know Li Aju and had no grudges against her. Therefore, he believed there was more to the case and requested an adjournment to apprehend the accomplices. Ji Xiangyun also filed a complaint, stating that the defendant had come to his home a few days earlier, pretending to be interested in renting a room. Although they usually had a rental sign posted, he did not pay attention at the time. Thinking back, he realized that the man was probably using the pretext of renting to observe his face. He did not recognize Li Aju and believed that there was more to the case. He knew that a former accountant in his shop, a Mr. Li, had committed theft and was prosecuted by him. Mr. Li was sentenced to imprisonment but was appealing the verdict, and the case was scheduled to be heard that afternoon. Therefore, the defendant may have been instigated by Mr. Li. He requested that the police not only apprehend the accomplices but also reserve the right to seek compensation for all damages. When questioned, the defendant, Han Yongzhang, admitted to pouring nitric acid. Judge Wu reviewed the confession and ordered Guo to be detained for further hearing on November 2nd.</p>

<p>Dozens of Shanties Destroyed</p>
<p>Two Children Burned to Death</p>
<p>A major fire broke out in Huazi Creek, which is under the jurisdiction of the Tanziwan Police Station in Zhabei, yesterday morning. Dozens of shanties were destroyed, and a mother and her son, Zhang Wu and her son, perished in the fire. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e172">Observation of the Fire Site <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The fire site was located at the western end of Zhongxing Road, south of the Dayangqiao Railway Bridge, at the eastern end of Panjiawan. Although the area was already urbanized, many shanties were interspersed with tiled bungalows, and some did not have house numbers. The fire site faced the Suzhou Creek and was backed by the Huazi Creek. Across the creek on both sides were also clusters of shanties and a small number of tiled bungalows. Approximately sixty to seventy shanties were destroyed, covering an area of about seven to eight acres.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Circumstances of the Fire <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the poor residents of the area were still asleep. A fire suddenly broke out in the shanty of Yang Junxiang (38 years old, a plasterer from Funing) along the creek in the northeast. Constable Li Maozhen, stationed at Post No. 52 nearby, saw the fire, called the Fire Department to come and extinguish it, and reported it to the Tanziwan Police Station. Patrol Officer Li Qingjie led the patrol police to maintain order. Unfortunately, the area was not equipped with fire hydrants, and there was no way to draw water at the time. Moreover, the northeast wind was very strong, and the flames spread to the southwest. Water was drawn from Dayangqiao and transported over the railway for firefighting. The fire was finally extinguished at around 6:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Discovery of Corpses <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>When the fire broke out, Yang Junxiang's shanty had two rooms. He lived in one, and the other was rented to Zhang Deyou from Qingjiang. Zhang had returned to his hometown to sell old goods, leaving only his wife, Wu (40 years old), and son, An Chenzi (13 years old), at home. Unfortunately, Wu and her son were unable to escape and perished in the fire. At the time, thousands of poor people were helping the elderly and children, grabbing their belongings, and fleeing for their lives, causing great disorder. No one knew that Wu and her son had perished in the fire. At around 8:00 AM, after a search, two corpses were discovered. Wu was found lying face down in the ashes, and An Chenzi was lying face up on a board. His limbs had fallen off, and his entire body was charred beyond recognition. The sight was extremely tragic. According to neighbors, Wu was a devout Buddhist who burned incense, lit candles, and chanted scriptures daily. Therefore, everyone called her "Grandma Dao."</p>

<p>After the incident, Patrol Officer Li of the Tanziwan Police Station sent Yang Junxiang, the source of the fire, to the Xin Zha Public Security Bureau for questioning. Meanwhile, he ordered Chen Quansheng, the local head of the twelfth district, to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. At around 5:00 PM, Inspector Zhang Zixuan arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased, Zhang Wu and Zhang Anchen, mother and son, had died from being burned alive. The local head was instructed to make arrangements for their burial. According to the subsequent investigation, the fire was believed to have been caused by incense and candles that were lit in the rented room of Yang Junxiang and had not been completely extinguished when everyone went to bed. The candles may have fallen onto the straw, causing the fire. The fire site has been cleared, and no other corpses were found until late at night.</p>

<p>Victims of Political Secret Agents Ma Shaowu and Chen Jing, Among Others</p>
<p>Chinese and French Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Extradite After Case Conclusion</p>
<p>Xiong Guohua, a self-confessed communist, was shot and wounded on the night of September 16th in Room 34 of the Qianji Hotel on Shanxi Road by an assassination squad organized by the communists. The police sent him to the hospital for treatment and assigned Detective Wan Yuke to guard him. However, the assassination squad, determined to kill Xiong, sent operatives to break into the hospital on the afternoon of September 26th and shoot Xiong to death in his hospital bed. Detective Wan and Chinese Constable No. 721, He Yongfu, who was assigned by the French Concession Police to escort the patient to the hospital, were also tragically killed in the crossfire. In response, the police authorities ordered Chinese and Western detectives to expedite the arrest and punishment of the perpetrators. On the 27th, after searching, the Chengdu Road Police Department successively apprehended ten male and female members of the assassination squad: Kuang Huian, Zhao Xuan, Tang Wanxuan, Lin Ermei, Meng Huating, Zhu Jinming, Li Yangshi, Li Zhoushi, Liu Jinrong, and Zhang Lishi. They also discovered 27 handguns, 2 Mauser pistols, two bombs, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and a steel vest hidden in the Xinwenxiang Silver Shop at No. 112, Rue Grolier in the French Concession. Additionally, they discovered many reactionary publications in Wenzhou Road and other locations. All the items were taken back to the police station and separately detained. It has now been a month, and the police have also clarified the details of the crimes committed by these individuals in the International Settlement. In addition to the two attempts to assassinate Xiong Guohua and the murder of Detective Wan and Constable He, the murder of Ma Shaowu (also known as Lu Kequan), a political secret agent of the former Municipal Public Security Bureau, on June 14th last year in Xiaohua Garden on Zhejiang Road, and the attack on Chen Jing, another political secret agent, on June 9th of this year on Guangxi Road, during which Constable No. 558, who witnessed the attack, was shot and killed while attempting to arrest the assailants, and Chen Jing was also wounded, were all committed by these individuals. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Kuang and the ten other men and women to the High Court Second Branch for a public trial. The police attorney, Gan Jingxian, presented the charges against each defendant, accusing them of endangering the Republic of China. Kuang, Zhao, Tang, Meng, and Zhu were charged with premeditated murder, while only Kuang and Lin Ermei were charged with illegally possessing firearms. To clarify the case, the court decided to try each case separately. Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the representative of the High Court Third Branch, arrived at the court with official letters, stating that some of the defendants had committed serious murder cases in the Chinese and French concessions. They requested permission to extradite them. Presiding Judge Yu ruled that the extradition issue should be considered after the cases filed by the Municipal Council had been tried and a verdict reached. The judge then rigorously questioned each defendant about their actions during the commission of the crimes and their behavior before and after the crimes. The questioning continued until noon without a conclusion, and the hearing was adjourned. The police then escorted the defendants away for separate detention.</p>

<p>A Razor in Hand, Resolved to Perish Together</p>
<p>Meeting on a Narrow Path, Cutting His Lover and Then Himself</p>
<p>Yan A'tu from Suzhou, thirty years old, used to make a small living in his hometown. Having accumulated some savings, in April of this year, Yan unexpectedly encountered Wu Dai'shi, a woman from the same village, thirty-two years old. They fell in love at first sight, forming an inextricable bond. However, because there were many eyes and ears in Suzhou, they could not do as they pleased. After several discussions, they resolutely took a train to Shanghai on April 26th, rented a house together, and lived as husband and wife. For several months, they were quite affectionate. However, the cost of living in Shanghai was high, and their savings were limited, making it unsustainable for them to simply sit and eat. In the past two months, they gradually felt the strain. Initially, Yan still caught crickets to earn a small profit, but now, as the weather grew colder, it was no longer the season for crickets, and he could not maintain their livelihood. The woman, on the other hand, was of a fickle nature. Seeing that Yan's money was running out and knowing that it would be difficult to grow old together, she broke away from Yan a month ago and became involved with another man, living with him at No. 30, Miaolong Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. After that, they occasionally met on the road, but the woman treated him like a stranger. Until recently, about a week ago, Yan encountered the woman again near the small vegetable market on Hardoon Road. Yan, facing financial difficulties and being unfamiliar with the people and places of Shanghai, had no one to turn to for help. Overwhelmed by hunger, he asked the woman for assistance. The woman flatly refused. The two argued as they walked along the road, until they reached Miaolong Lane. The woman took out two small silver coins and gave them to the lane guard, instructing him to hand them over to Yan and sternly telling him never to come again. She then turned and left without looking back. Yan, considering that he had spent a considerable sum of money on the woman since they had met, including seventy or eighty gold in Shanghai, felt deeply insulted by her actions. Outraged, he took the money and walked out of the lane entrance. In a nearby second-hand store, he bought a barber's razor for ten copper coins, intending to use it to kill the woman and then commit suicide, so that they would perish together. However, he had no suitable opportunity for a while. Until 9:40 AM on the 27th of this month, Yan saw the woman walking alone in Miaolong Lane. He rushed out with the razor and violently slashed at the woman's head and other areas, causing severe injuries to her neck and back. Blood gushed out like a spring, and she collapsed to the ground in pain. Yan, believing that the woman was dead, then cut his own throat, also injuring his windpipe. Blood flowed non-stop, and he fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Upon learning of the incident, the Jing'an Temple police immediately dispatched an ambulance to take the woman to Guangren Hospital for treatment and Yan A'shi to the police hospital. Because Yan's injuries were lighter, after bandaging and applying medicine, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, not only charged Yan with attempted murder under Article 284, Section 2 of the Criminal Law but also recounted the above circumstances, saying that Wu Dai'shi's injuries were quite severe and she was currently hospitalized for treatment, so she could not appear in court today and requested a postponement. He then presented the murder weapon as evidence. When questioned, Yan A'shi confessed everything. Judge Wu ordered the defendant to be detained for a seven-day postponement for further investigation and instructed a forensic doctor to examine the injuries.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Physicians Association held its autumn general meeting at Yipinxian Restaurant at 6 PM on the 28th. Comrade Mao Xiaxuan from the Municipal Party Committee attended to provide guidance. Members who attended included Xu Naili, Luo Chuanrong, Chen Fangzhi, Wang Qizhang, Zhu Zengzong, Ni Baochun, Cheng Hanzhang, Fu Wenshou, Li Gang, Qu Zhifu, Ding Huiting, Zhang Senyu, Yu Yichu, Liu Zhigang, Guo Qiyuan, Yu Songjun, Pang Jingzhou, Zhou Junchang, Qu Shaowei, Jiang Zhenxun, Chuan Zhuangmin, Ye Zhisheng, Wu Jishun, Xi Shintai, Tang Shunian, and over one hundred and fifty others. The meeting began with a report from the General Manager. Chairman Song Guobin was unable to attend and had sent a letter entrusting Mr. Xu Naili to act as his proxy. The meeting was then declared open. Wang Wanbai was temporarily elected as the recorder. The proceedings were as follows: 1. Formal greetings; 2. Chairman Xu Naili reported on the association's affairs, outlining the various important tasks handled by the executive committee in the past six months; 3. Finance Committee member Yu Songjun reported on the brief financial statements; 4. Editorial Committee reported on the publication status of "New Medicine and Society"; 5. Introduction of twenty-five new members; 6. Speech by the representative of the Municipal Party Committee, who stated: "Foreigners often criticize our groups and societies for lacking organization, but given the spirit of your association and the achievements of your work, who can say there is no organization? If all sectors and organizations across the country could be like your association, who would dare to insult us again? I am an outsider to the field of medicine, but I will briefly share my observations for your reference. First, medicine is originally a practical field for the public. Currently, the public lacks knowledge and awareness of hygiene. I hope your association can do more for the public. Second, strive for self-sufficiency in medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Currently, most materials still rely on imports. I hope you will always remember to promote domestic production. Third, Shanghai is a model for the entire country, and you are all leaders in the medical field." 7. Chairman's closing remarks, first thanking the Party representative for his guidance, then thanking the association's legal counsel and accountants for their hard work in the past six months, and finally thanking the Chinese Medical Association for generously lending its meeting place. 8. Discussion of proposals: (One item) Requesting the assembly to discuss how to handle disputes between members when they arise. (Decision) The matter should be accepted and dealt with in a reasonable manner. (One item) Requesting the organization of a specialized committee responsible for reviewing, managing, and disseminating medical and health knowledge to the public. (Decision) Passed and handed over to the next executive committee for handling. (One item) Abolishing the position of General Manager and hiring a clerk to assist the executive committee members in handling association affairs. After the proposal was put forward, there was a unanimous call for its withdrawal. As a result, it was not seconded and therefore did not pass. 9. Re-election of the executive committee members. Fang Xi first designated Wang Wanbai, Zhong Hanzhang, Ye Zhisheng, Wu Yichu, Jiang Baokang, Chen Rongzhang, Ni Baochun, and Jiang Zhenxun to be responsible for collecting, counting, and announcing the ballots.

<p>Gong Chunsheng from Suzhou, who works at the Jinzhong Exchange, lives at No. 2 Songbai Hutong, Ninghai Street, Old North Gate in the South City. Because Gong is usually lavish in his behavior, he was coveted by bandits. Last night at around 6:30 PM, six robbers disguised as public officials searching for red pills, wearing short jackets and long robes, suddenly broke into the inner room. They first deceived and confined the tenants of the Gong residence in the back building and nailed the door shut. Then, they arbitrarily searched and robbed the house.

Chairman Tang Haian and the leaders of various fellow native associations gathered together, creating a grand and celebratory atmosphere. "My brother and I were late because we went to Jiangwan to attend the opening ceremony of the ball field. I deeply apologize. My fellow natives have a long history in Shanghai and have good businesses. Therefore, we have made a significant contribution to Shanghai. Although the number of people is not accurate, it is no less than 200,000. Among those from the provinces who are running businesses in Shanghai, my fellow natives are second only to the Ningbo natives. It is deeply regrettable that my fellow natives have been operating in this city without a whole native association to seek welfare for the people. Fortunately, Chairman Tang's enthusiasm and the efforts of fellow natives have made today's association possible. In the past two years, whether actively or passively, the progress has been considerable. However, the fellow natives association cannot be achieved by one or two people. It must be achieved by the strength of all the fellow natives, joining efforts, and benefiting the people. Benefit from others, and it will benefit yourself. That is my hope for everyone to work together for the public good." Weng Ziguang, Zheng Zhengqiu, Zheng Xingpu, and Huang Zhenwen also gave speeches. Guest Guo Le also gave a speech in response, reaching the height of the occasion.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Shuowen Yao Reprinted <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Shuowen Yao, compiled by Ding Jun Fubao in two volumes, is edited using Professor Tu Zhou's method. Its greatest invention is the correction of Xu Xu's preface, changing "the book does not have the word" to "suddenly without the word," based on Zheng Kangcheng's theory of borrowing in haste. Also, Mr. Wu Zhihui changed "ling chang" to "ling liang," both of which are mistakes due to similar forms. Annotation is due to meaning, and borrowing is due to sound. The two are completely different. "Ling liang" is a double sound, so it can be borrowed. For example, "liang qi" can be made "ling qi," and "shi ling qi shou mu" is also. "Liang ren" can be made "ling ren," and "shi wo wu ling ren" is also. Based on this, thousands of years of mistakes can be corrected, which is a major reform for primary school students. The whole book is shallow, easy to understand, step by step into the winning, is the easiest to enter the book of Shuowen. Many schools in Shanghai have adopted it, and the second edition has recently been published. Each volume costs one yuan, and the general distributor is the Medical Book Bureau, 204 Mei Baige Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Impressions of Suiyuan (4) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhenhua.</p>
<p>4. The Life Customs of Nomadic Mongolians</p>
<p>The Mongolian people of Suiyuan are divided into six banners under the Iolan Chab League, and seven banners under the Ikchao League, totaling thirteen banners. Additionally, there is one Tumed banner. The people of this banner have lived alongside the Han Chinese in county seats for a long time and have assimilated into Han culture, with no differences in customs and habits. As for the thirteen banners of the Iolan and Ikchao Leagues, they occupy 860,000 square li of land with a population of 200,000. Among them, except for the one Yuanchenhan banner belonging to the Khalkha group, the rest belong to the Ordos group. Therefore, although their life customs are very different from those of the Han Chinese, there are only minor differences between the banners themselves.</p>
<p>Mongolian life is simple and plain, mostly engaged in nomadism, with no knowledge of farming. Dwellings are mostly yurts, circular in shape, with an average circumference of about twenty feet. The dome-shaped structure resembles an umbrella, covered with wool felt. The door faces southeast and is fitted with a wooden frame and two small doors. The yurt can be disassembled and carried, as nomadic life involves moving with the availability of water and pasture, making relocation necessary. The disassembly and assembly of the yurt are mostly done by women, whose movements are agile. It can be disassembled within minutes and erected within half an hour.</p>
<p>Inside the yurt, the floor is covered with wool felt. The stove is in the center, the west side is the men's sitting and sleeping area, and the east side is the women's sitting and sleeping area, with cabinets and water tanks. The northwest corner is reserved for the shrine. At night, there are no beds or bedding, and they sleep in their clothes on the carpet.</p>
<p>Food consists mainly of mutton, fried rice, tea bricks, and cow and sheep milk. Milk is prepared in various ways. It is slowly boiled over a fire, and the coagulated fat layer is taken off to make milk skin and butter. The remaining part is dried in the sun and kneaded into round blocks called sour milk, which tastes both sour and rancid, making it difficult to swallow unless one is accustomed to it. In addition, milk juice mixed with chicken egg whites is dried to make milk tofu, a delicacy for entertaining guests. Milk juice is also stored in jars to ferment, and over time it becomes milk wine.</p>
<p>As for clothing, apart from princes and wealthy households who wear silk and satin, commoners wear cotton cloth, sourced from the Han Chinese. The styles still follow the old Qing Dynasty system, with long robes and belts, with little difference between men and women, except for slight variations in color. Generally, men wear blue or gray, those in mourning wear green, women wear red when young and blue or purple when old, while lamas wear red, yellow, and purple. New clothes are worn until they are worn out, without washing.</p>
<p>Overall, the Mongolians' clothing, food, and housing fail to meet hygiene standards. They also have no medicine when they get sick, so their mortality rate is very high. Furthermore, many Mongolians become lamas; if a family has three sons, one must become a lama. As a result, lamas account for nearly one-third of the total population. The reasons why people like to become lamas include not only the superstition of becoming a Buddha and hoping for happiness in the afterlife, but also three other major reasons: First, to avoid corvée labor, lamas are not managed by princes and are exempt from all duties. Second, due to vanity, lamas have a noble status and do not have to kneel before princes. If there is no lama in a family, they will be ridiculed. Third, lamas lead a leisurely life, and do not have to struggle for food and clothing every day, with most lamas living in 368 temples.</p>
<p>As for Mongolian customs, marriage is also decided by parents through matchmaking. Ordinary men marry at the age of fifteen or sixteen, while women are usually three or four years older than men. The betrothal gifts include cattle, sheep, horses, clothing, coral, and silverware, the amount varying depending on wealth. On the wedding day, the groom first rides a horse to the bride's house to welcome her. The bride's relatives and friends stand outside the door, pretending to refuse to accept him. Then, the bride comes out, mounts a horse, and gallops around her yurt three times. She is then accompanied by a dozen or twenty relatives and friends, riding alongside the groom to his house. The bride dismounts and enters the yurt, pays respects to the stove god, and then one of the male elders of the groom's family holds a bamboo chopstick and separates the bride's hair from the middle to both sides. This is the "separation of hair" ceremony, as Mongolian virgins comb their hair backward, but after marriage, they comb it to the left and right, hanging coral and silver plates as ornaments. Therefore, the "separation of hair" ceremony is an important wedding ritual. After the "separation of hair" ceremony, guests are entertained, and the wedding is completed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, married women can return home at will before having children. After having children, they must wait until they have grown into adults and can ride horses on their own before a lama chants scriptures to allow the mother to return to her parents' home. If the husband and wife are not in harmony, both men and women can file for divorce. However, if a woman files for divorce, she must return all or part of the betrothal gifts to the man's family. After the divorce, both men and women are free to remarry. This is a general outline of the wedding customs.</p>
<p>As for funeral rituals, a few people follow Han customs and use coffins for burial, but most practice cremation and abandonment. Cremation is more common among wealthy families. The method involves cremating the corpse, grinding the ashes into fine powder, mixing it with flour, and kneading it into human shapes, about several inches long, which are then stored in the stupas of large temples. Abandonment is the most common practice, which involves throwing the corpse into the mountains and fields, allowing birds and beasts to peck at it. If the corpse is still intact within three days, it means that the deceased had committed serious sins during their lifetime, and lamas must be invited to chant scriptures to repent for them.</p>
<p>Mongolian life is simple, and apart from weddings and funerals, there are no other special customs. The only holidays of the year are the Kitchen God Festival and the New Year, and the rituals are also very simple. As for other culture and education, there is little to speak of. Apart from lamas who know Tibetan and can chant Buddhist scriptures, less than one in a hundred ordinary people can read. In this era of rapid advancements in world civilization, Mongolian life is still so simple and crude. Unless improvements are sought quickly, it may be difficult to compete for survival with other ethnic groups in the future.</p>
<p>In summary, the above sections show the corruption of Suiyuan society and the hardships of the people. Although it is not easy to suggest relief measures, according to the author's humble opinion, the first priority should be to prohibit opium and rescue women. We must not harm the people by selling their children to buy opium. Once opium and prostitution are eliminated, the fundamental vitality of society will be restored, and then we can talk about suppressing bandits. The method of suppressing bandits should involve setting up village defense corps in the countryside in winter, with practical training. If the people have the power to defend themselves, bandits will not be difficult to eliminate. Once banditry is eliminated and the foundations of rural areas are consolidated, we must then find ways to recover the properties of Catholic churches, and restrict the illegal power of Catholic churches so that they do not harm the villagers. Then, various constructions can be carried out. On the other hand, roads should be built to connect the banners of Inner Mongolia, facilitating the exchange of people between the Han and Mongolian populations. Mongolians should be taught farming methods, and their lifestyles should be improved. Mongolian schools should be established to impart scientific knowledge, dispel Buddhist superstitions, and promote Han-Mongolian marriages to reduce the divide between the ethnic groups. In this way, both Han and Mongolian people can live and work in peace and prosperity, and there is hope for the development of the Northwest. (The End)</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Unable to Understand Salt Tax Regulations, He Pities a Young Girl; Eager to Hear of Hardships, He Visits a Poor Family</p>
<p>That old woman calling out for "Guoguo Kui" said: "Poor people's lives... What's there to see? Just endless suffering." Zhichien said, "I want to know how hard it is. Please sit down, old woman, and let's talk." The old woman did not answer him, but hobbled over to Sister-in-law Hu and asked, "What does this sir do? Is he here to distribute grain? That would be like the sun shining into the house!" Although she spoke in a low voice, Zhichien heard her clearly. He felt that they had great expectations of him, and if he just left like this, he would feel bad. He had originally intended to just come in and take a look and leave, but the mention of "distributing grain" made him freeze in the center of the courtyard, unsure of what to do. Sister-in-law Hu wanted to take this opportunity to test his abilities to make connections. She narrowed her eyes, looked at Zhichien, and said with a smile to the old woman, "Didn't I say that I was going to find someone for my niece? There are guests living in Little Western Paradise who are interested, but nothing is certain yet. This sir..." She lowered her voice and whispered something to the old woman. Zhichien could see that this situation was embarrassing, and his face turned red. He thought quickly and realized that he couldn't be ambiguous here. He said, "Sister-in-law, I've heard a little about your relatives' affairs. I have good intentions and want to advise you not to do this." Zhichien said this hastily to clarify that he wasn't there to look at the girl, but he didn't have any other solutions for them. However, Sister-in-law Hu continued to misunderstand, always thinking that he had come because he admired Yueying. So, she wanted to ask him for a second feasible solution. (52)</p>
<h3 id="e194">Vegetable Seedling Flood <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jinyu</p>
<p>The transition from August to September – the vegetable seedling flood – is an important season for farmers along the Puzuo Dike. They hastily cut away the withered vines of watermelons and golden melons that had provided the city dwellers with relief from the summer heat, and painstakingly used hoes to meticulously till the soil, creating neat and orderly drainage ditches. The seedbeds were leveled like whetstones and evenly fertilized, like a beautifully dressed woman who, having come out of her door, turns back to reapply her makeup. In this way, perhaps after rain and moisture, the soil hardens, and then another effort is made to refine it. Then, they scatter seeds of long-stemmed cabbage and snow cabbage, treading lightly. Within three or four days, sprouts emerge distinctly.</p>
<p>Protecting vegetable seedlings is as painstaking as nurturing silkworms. From sprouting to three or four inches high, over the course of a month, not only must there be timely rain and sunshine, but also daily, even combing, and weeding out aphids. The biggest enemy of vegetable seedlings is the submerged grub, followed by the biting grub. If biting grubs are found on the vegetable seedlings, they can be killed with pesticide powder without any problem. But if submerged grubs swarm across the fields, they are like a bone-deep sore, and the vegetable seedlings can only wither and fade away every day, until they collapse.</p>
<p>The clear moonlight of the Mid-Autumn Festival shines through the flat, green vegetable seedlings, like graceful goddesses, wandering back and forth between the embroidered fields. After offering sacrifices to the moon and burning incense, the farmers all wear joyful expressions, indicating that the short-term labor will bring them several times more harvest than other crops.</p>
<p>However, the dike farmers, who are not increasing in number, cannot escape the sad atmosphere of rural decline. After a few days of hope, their beloved vegetable seedlings are almost entirely overturned by submerged grubs. In addition to the labor of blood and sweat, they also lose the capital they invested in hiring workers, fertilizer, and pesticides. Sadly, their capital is all borrowed from high-interest loans, and of course, the land rent cannot be repaid.</p>

<p>— Yi Zhen</p>
<p>People filled the bridge and stood below it. A disturbed atmosphere enveloped these people.</p>
<p>A young man led a pair of thin, old, and tired cows, slowly, slowly, from a dilapidated thatched hut towards the big stone bridge. The old cows seemed to know that a great disaster was about to befall them, and they refused to move their hind legs. So the young man angrily pulled the rope tightly. The cows couldn't bear the pain and continued to walk forward. Slowly, slowly.</p>
<p>They walked onto the big stone bridge. Thwack! Another young man suddenly raised a large wooden stick and struck the thin cow's leg hard. The old cow collapsed! A long and sorrowful cry.</p>
<p>Then two young men and four strong men ran up. They deftly tied the old cow's thin legs tightly. Ah! A thin rope severed all the cow's freedom. Then, sharp, large stones were continuously slammed onto the cow's massive head. The old cow shook its legs, which had lost their freedom, and endured. A little bit of fresh blood flowed from its wounded mouth, and drops of hot tears dripped from its lifeless eyes. The muted cry was long and sorrowful.</p>
<p>Finally, the sorrowful cry slowly weakened, weakened. Until it stopped...</p>
<p>Two young men dragged the cow's legs and threw it onto the empty ground at the foot of the bridge. Two sharp and gleaming knives first cut off the toes that had walked thousands of miles for people! Then, they chopped off its massive head... Fresh blood stained the yellowing grass.</p>
<p>Ah! A lifetime of hard work! Only to be rewarded with such an end!</p>

<p>— (Retired Farmer)</p>
<p>Some people may call these words cold-blooded.</p>
<p>A child used a bamboo pole to hit a crab. The crab became angry, raised its two big claws to resist, and clamped the bamboo pole tightly. The child then caught the crab.</p>
<p>If the crab had known to be sensible, not clamp the bamboo pole with its claws, cultivated deep patience, and not become angry at all, there would have been no reason for the child to catch it. Suppressing anger and calming wrath is the way for a wise person to protect themselves!</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The demeanor of officials should always be more generous than that of ordinary soldiers. Although they generally lowered their heads and knelt, their upper bodies were still upright, making them appear more dignified than those prostrating like toads. However, the attire of these officials and soldiers was uniformly neat and beautiful: they looked like two rows of moving lanterns, specially set up to welcome the Empress Dowager. We sat in yellow or red sedan chairs between these two rows of moving lanterns, slowly passing by: plus, the eunuchs who carried the chairs were all dressed in extremely gorgeous palace attire: therefore, the scenery of this comedy was extraordinarily colorful and dazzling! At that time, the sun was at its peak, and the light was very strong, shining on these red and green colors, making our procession as dazzling as a long rainbow, which everyone who saw it couldn't help but stop to watch.</p>
<p>Although the colors of our team were so rich and beautiful, in spirit, they were still very solemn and quiet, almost without any sound. Even the little eunuchs carrying the sedan chairs didn't make much noise. This was not because their footsteps were too light, but because of the half-wet yellow sand spread on the ground, which covered their footsteps entirely. In such a quiet atmosphere, we sat stiffly in the sedan chairs, resembling the clay and wood statues, or the characters in the historical paintings painted on tapestries or oil paintings, who suddenly came back to life due to some strange magic, lined up, and walked on the street.</p>
<p>In Fengtian, such a grand and imposing ceremony might not be seen once in hundreds of years: this time, it happened to allow those officials to attend in person. All ordinary people were not allowed to watch. (162)</p>

<p>— Yan Beguang</p>
<p>With yellow chrysanthemums blooming and red maples dyed with rouge, it is the perfect time of year for pleasant outings. If we travel to Huzhou, the scenery of mountains and lakes can make people's eyes wander and their hearts soar. For famous scenic spots such as Baique, Yunchao, and Daoyan, it is necessary to use boats to travel through the waterways, just as hiring boats is necessary to visit the Rain Tower in Jiaxing.</p>
<p>Every day, when the east just barely shows the white of fish bellies, they get up and wash, appearing very neat and tidy. Their clothing is mostly made of black Huzhou crepe. Promoting the local product of Huzhou crepe is worthy of praise during the Women's National Goods Year. But their bound feet have undergone a great deal of artistic care. A pair of black satin embroidered leather-soled slippers is truly spotless. After getting on the boat, familiar tourists can sometimes see the various colors of nail polish on their toes, and their fleshy legs are smeared with talcum powder.</p>
<p>In the hazy morning mist, the riverfront of the inn is their market for greeting tourists. The speaking skills and tones are purely Huzhou dialect, which is interesting and elegant.</p>
<p>After the tourists board the boat, they untie the cable and set sail, and the rippling waves can clear people's minds. When rocking to remote harbor, tourists can ask them to sing new-style songs like "Peach Blossom River" or "Beauty Talk." When rocking the boat, the swaying of their willow waists is as soft as a dancer's waist!</p>
<p>When it's time to eat lunch, they prepare delicious boat dishes, anchor in the middle of the lake, and they can hold the wine pot and drink with you. But the tour fee is not expensive. If three or four people travel together, it can be considered an economical trip.</p>

<p>— Sha Yu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, who has always been impatient, went to a noodle shop to eat noodles. After sitting down, he had just told the waiter what kind of noodles he wanted, before the waiter could even turn around, he had already started urging the noodles to come quickly. In less than a minute, he had been banging the table and hitting the bench, making a lot of noise. It was only with great difficulty that he saw the waiter carrying a bowl of steaming hot meat noodles, walking towards him. Mr. Zhang quickly raised his chopsticks, preparing to eat. But the waiter replied righteously, "Guests, after you finish eating the noodles, the bowl has to be taken away and washed before it can be used to serve noodles to other people. But I am also an impatient person, and I can't wait for you to finish eating the noodles and take the bowl away, so I dumped the noodles upstairs, so I can take this bowl and do other business." Mr. Zhang was even more angry when he heard this, but he couldn't find a reason to refute the waiter. He had to throw down his chopsticks and angrily ran home, telling his wife what had happened, and then said, "Aren't you angry? What face do I have to live in this world? I must commit suicide!" His wife agreed, "It's good that you commit suicide, but I will inevitably remarry after you commit suicide. I am also an impatient person, please find a husband for me first, and then commit suicide." While Mr. and Mrs. Zhang were talking, suddenly there was a loud crash, bricks and stones flew, and a hole opened in the wall next door, and someone crawled over. He shouted loudly, "Sister-in-law, don't be impatient, marry me instead!" He turned to Mr. Zhang and said, "I am also an impatient person, so I don't have time to go out the front door and come in the front door, which is so far away, so I had to break through the wall and crawl over."</p>
<h3 id="e201">Roasted Meat <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>One day, Mr. Wang suddenly carried a piece of lean and fat meat home and gave it to his wife, instructing her: "Roast this meat plainly. It must be roasted until it is tender, so that it tastes good. Do you understand?" His wife pouted and said, "Why don't I understand? You don't have to nag." After Mr. Wang heard this, he went out to do errands. At twelve o'clock, he returned home, preparing to eat. As soon as he stepped through the door, he saw his wife covered in sweat, wearing short clothes, rushing out from inside, panting and saying, "Tired to death! Tired to death! You want to get rid of meat, causing me to sweat so much!" Mr. Wang asked, "Is it roasted?" His wife said, "Almost! It's not very rotten yet, your meat is stringy and it's not easy to get rid of!" After speaking, she went inside and picked out a black thing and threw it to Mr. Wang, "See, isn't it still very rotten?" Mr. Wang took a look and the piece of meat was like a piece of mud, no longer tasty. Angrily, he laughed and said, "How exactly did you roast this meat?" His wife said, "You said 'get rid of meat', so I used a rope to lash the meat and 'get rid' of it inside, and have already 'got rid' of it so much sweat." After Mr. Wang heard this, he was speechless with anger, after a long while, he said: "What I was saying was roast meat, that is to clean the meat, and roast it on the fire, I wasn't telling you to 'get rid' of it like that!" A day later, Mr. Wang bought tofu and went home, but before he even left, his wife had already chased him out and said: "The method you taught me is good! Go and see, go and see." Mr. Wang was confused, and rushed to the stove to take a look, and saw that a few blocks of tofu had already been turned into a white, greasy tofu pulp by his wife.</p>

<p>When Mr. Li came out of the cinema, he found that his wallet in his pocket had been stolen. He hurriedly looked around and saw a disheveled person walking away quickly, so he ran over and grabbed the person. The person looked at Mr. Li and said anxiously, "Sir, I didn't steal your wallet." Mr. Li thought if he didn't steal the wallet, how would he know about the stolen wallet? Without saying a word, he handed the person over to the police. Sure enough, the police searched the thief and found his lost wallet. The police asked Mr. Li how he discovered that he had lost his wallet, so Mr. Li vividly described the situation of the stolen wallet. But the thief interrupted him and said, "Sir, what you said is completely wrong. I didn't do it that way, I stole your wallet like this." As the thief spoke, he even made gestures, so Mr. Li couldn't help but laugh, the police also laughed, and the people watching around also laughed. But when they stopped laughing, the thief had already slipped away while they were laughing.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Recent Key Points of Improvements for Colleges and Above by the Ministry of Education (Part 2) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>1.  Streamlining Departments:</p>
<p>In the past, the establishment of departments in universities often disregarded faculty and facilities, leading to arbitrary setups that affected other departments and rarely achieved good results. Moreover, many departments in various universities were redundant, especially in Shanghai and Beiping. Taking Beiping as an example, in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), there were twelve public and private universities and independent colleges, divided into more than thirty colleges (departments in independent colleges are considered as colleges) and more than one hundred and thirty departments. By college type, there were the following: College of Liberal Arts, College of Law as follows, College of Science - 7, with Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine having one or two colleges each. By department, among the one hundred and thirty-plus departments, there were ten each of Chinese Literature and Economics, nine each of Political Science and Foreign Literature, seven each of Law and Physics, six each of History, Philosophy, and Mathematics, five each of Education and Sociology, and Chemistry, four each of Biology and Psychology, and two each of Geography and Music. In addition, each of the other departments had one or two. The situation of redundant departments in Shanghai universities was similar to that in Beiping. Other provinces and cities had fewer redundant departments. However, the Ministry of Education ordered to merge, reduce, or stop admitting new students in stages. For example, the Department of Philosophy and Education of the Women's College of Liberal Arts of Beiping University was abolished, the Departments of Chinese Literature, History, and Geography were merged into the Department of Liberal Arts and History, and the College of Commerce and the College of Law were merged and renamed the College of Law and Commerce, with the establishment of the Department of Commerce, International Trade, Business Administration, and Transportation Management, which were not allowed to recruit new students from this year. The Department of Sociology of Beiping Normal University was abolished, the Department of Law of Tsinghua University was abolished, and the College of Education of Jinan University was abolished. The original departments were merged into the Department of Education and incorporated into the College of Liberal Arts. The College of Law was abolished, and the original students were transferred to the College of Law of the National Central University to study. The Department of Sociology of Henan University stopped recruiting new students, and the Department of Civil Engineering was abolished. The Departments of Chinese Literature and History were merged into the Department of Liberal Arts and History. The College of Law, except for the Department of Economics, no longer recruits students. After the existing students of the Departments of Law and Political Science graduate, the Department of Economics will be merged into the College of Liberal Arts. Shanxi College of Education and Shanxi College of Law were both merged into Shanxi University. The College of Education of Sichuan University was abolished and changed to the Department of Education and incorporated into the College of Liberal Arts. The Departments of Mathematics and Physics of Anhui University were merged into the Department of Mathematics and Physics. The College of Law was abolished, and the original students were either transferred to other schools or changed departments. Hebei College of Law and Commerce stopped recruiting students altogether. Other schools with redundant departments and lack of faculty and facilities, and the departments that were unable to develop, were all ordered to draft merger plans and submit them to the Ministry for approval. The purpose is to completely reduce redundancy and adapt to actual needs, so that the human and financial resources of various schools are concentrated on special enrichment and development.</p>
<p>2.  Enriching Equipment:</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the new equipment expenditure of colleges and above in the country was about 6.4 million yuan, 200,000 yuan. It can be seen that the annual new equipment expenditure of various schools in recent years is about 6.4 million yuan, which is undoubtedly a considerable progress. Among the 6.4 million yuan of new equipment expenditure in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), library fees accounted for 17%, and instrument, specimen, and machine fees accounted for 26%, totaling 43%. The remaining 57% was mostly for construction, repairs, and school furniture and sundries. Among the more than 6.2 million yuan of new equipment expenditure in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), library fees accounted for 18%. Among the more than 6.5 million yuan of new equipment expenditure recently, library fees accounted for 18.8%. Instrument, specimen, and machine fees accounted for 31.8%. Among the more than 6.5 million yuan of new equipment expenditure recently, library fees accounted for 32%. If we compare the three years, the recent library fees have increased by about 2% compared to the 20th year of the Republic (1931), and by about 0.2% compared to the 21st year of the Republic (1932). Instrument, specimen, and machine fees have increased by about 5.6% compared to the 20th year of the Republic (1931), and by about 0.2% compared to the 21st year of the Republic (1932). It can be seen that various schools have indeed made considerable increases in equipment such as books and instruments. However, this increase refers to the whole. Individually, many still do not meet the statutory standards, especially private ones. According to the regulations, the equipment expenditure of universities should account for at least 15% of the recurring expenditure, and the administrative expenditure should not exceed 10%. Therefore, colleges and above should strive to reduce administrative expenditure and increase equipment expenditure. In addition to ordering various schools to enrich equipment such as instruments and books, the Ministry of Education has approved the subsidy fee for private colleges and above this year, with equipment fee accounting for 81.5%. This is the meaning of special attention to equipment.</p>

The subsidized special professorship fee is set at 4,000 yuan per seat this year, and the minimum monthly salary must not be less than 280 yuan. When there is a surplus in the aforementioned professorship fee, all the funds will be used to supplement the equipment fee for the subject. 6. Lecture fees are limited to the purchase of specialized machines, machine specimens, models, instruments, medicines, and books. 7. The subsidy fee will be issued monthly by the Ministry of Education. 8. After receiving the subsidy fee, each school should immediately fill out the receipt and submit it to the Ministry of Education for transfer to the audit agency for verification. The receipt should be signed and sealed by the principal and the person in charge of the subsidized college or department at the same time. Legal receipts must be submitted for equipment fees, and salary receipts must be submitted for education fees. The aforementioned receipts must be submitted at least once every three months. 9.

Recently, the Japanese Association in Surabaya (another port city in Java) initiated a public tennis tournament in Surabaya. This time, there were people of all nationalities participating in the men's singles, and especially many, a total of 46 people, which can be described as extremely grand. However, the result of the competition was that the men's singles championship was still won by Mr. Xu. This is not surprising. However, Mr. Xu and Lin Xuyin also won the doubles championship, so the local overseas Chinese were very excited and asked the reporter to report to the sports community in the country.</p>

<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>Those who are sick and do not take medicine often encounter traditional Chinese medicine. Those with mediocre talent often encounter mediocre people. Those with sufficient talent, if they do not do good, will do evil, and will never be content to be mediocre. Doing good is beneficial to others, and doing evil only cares about oneself. Those with talent would rather do evil. The more talent one has, the more ability one has to do evil. Those with good ability, one sees their good, but not their evil. Evil is disguised by good. Therefore, Lao Zhuang advocated eliminating sages and eliminating knowledge.</p>
<p>However, Lao Zhuang were also extremely intelligent people. The Daodejing and the Zhuangzi reveal the secrets of the human world with extreme thoroughness. Logically, sin should be reduced. But from another point of view, it is no different from teaching a monkey to climb a tree. It cannot be reduced, but instead is encouraged. This may be the pain that they spoke of and then wanted not to speak of. If words were exchanged for actions, it could become the greatest treachery.</p>
<p>And these two things are like explaining oneself through one's own actions, like understanding the principle of the curtain, and also covering oneself with a layer of curtain. Clever people will say, "Today's me is not yesterday's me." With a flip of the tongue, they transform themselves. In fact, they have also removed the curtain themselves, and then put on another layer of curtain, or simply revealed their original form.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Wushan <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Guang</p>
<p>In the twilight veil, the ship slowly anchored at Wushan. The passengers had already strolled onto the deck, some holding pipes, some yawning, some paying attention to the teahouse attendants' directions. Everyone was constantly sending curious gazes towards the riverbank, where the castle was located, as if they could find some eye-catching architecture and lively streets.</p>
<p>However, here, what entered people's eyes was nothing but a patch of glaring desolation.</p>
<p>The city was perched on top of a not-very-tall earthen mountain, low and pitiful. It seemed that its deliberate squatting high up was not to show the characteristics of a mountain city, but to let people appreciate its desolation and backwardness. That is to say, in the continuous disturbances, under poor natural conditions, a town, although located on an important river line, is how it is on the verge of dying.</p>
<p>The observers shook their heads and already showed a dispirited expression. They didn't seem to feel any interest at all. A young man who looked like he was just out of the house stared and muttered to himself:</p>
<p>"Oh my, is that what it's like after all this talk?" He even gave a wry smile from his nose.</p>
<p>Many people went back to their berths. From the murky river surface, three or four grayish-brown rowboats floated lazily. But there was no shouting to sell food, and no sound of soliciting customers. It seemed that the purpose of those boat owners was simply to rush over and share a little of the so-called excitement of the human world. However, because of these scattered embellishments, the river surface seemed even colder.</p>
<p>"Is anyone going ashore?" Those who stayed on the deck asked each other listlessly.</p>
<p>"Come to the back, come to the back." Only then did the small boats row towards the stern of the steamboat with more effort.</p>
<p>"Don't delay, don't cause trouble!" The soldiers escorting the boat warned each boarding guest.</p>
<p>When I was in a dilapidated rowboat with a tea attendant and two small-time opium merchants, the night had already gradually deepened. A kind of gloomy feeling surrounded us. However, although the place where we were moored was still in the middle of this long gorge, the gloom was the desolation of Guanghan and did not carry the depth and solemnity that should be in the mountain gorges. Because the mountains that had rushed from the upper reaches seemed to have suddenly collapsed here, leaving only some earthen hills and small mountains, and a riverbank piled with rubble.</p>
<p>"Hey, Fangfang," the boatman pointed to the boat's hull with an empty wine bottle and shouted, "You should pay some money to fix it."</p>
<p>"Easy to say, fix it..."</p>
<p>As if criticizing the accuser's lack of awareness, the boatman didn't finish speaking, and then lazily turned his head to take care of his oar.</p>
<p>This was an old man in his fifties, with a sandy white beard, a dark and wrinkled face. He lazily wielded his dilapidated oar inlaid with new wood, his waist stretching and bending, his eyes half-closed, as if his work was not for food, but to casually dispose of his time that had long been pawned. Due to the tea attendant's intensified urging, before long, the boat had already landed.</p>
<p>"Old man," I asked the boatman, who now only had to take care of the boat's direction, "I heard that bandits have appeared again?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they're making trouble again. The army only left a few days ago."</p>
<p>Then the two opium merchants shifted their bodies and began to show off their erudition. In such a conversation, the boat docked. Then, walking over a sandy beach mixed with gravel, walking up the sloping path, we entered the desolate county town.</p>
<p>However, saying it was a county town, its size and liveliness were actually disproportionate, even compared with the market towns in other regions. And it still maintained the old appearance of all small towns, narrow streets, low houses, bamboo poles for drying clothes and firewood waiting to be split across the streets. A little boy, holding up his pants with one hand, and holding a rattan whip-like tow rope in the other, cried and ran towards several running piglets.</p>
<p>On the steps of several teahouses, there were stoves and equipment for cooking opium. The two opium merchants went to discuss their business in a serious manner, and the tea attendant disappeared under the eaves of a dark hole. And I, who was already very disappointed at that time, wandered alone in the market until I gathered my companions, the opium merchants and the tea attendant, at the city gate.</p>
<p>We stepped on the steep return path again, but I was still oppressed by a kind of restless mood.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang, look up!" the tea attendant suddenly greeted me in a laughing tone, while turning on his electric torch.</p>
<p>Following the direction of the light, I looked up at the top of the electric pole on the side of the road: hanging on it were three terrible things that had lost their blood color. But I did not panic as my companions had hoped. After staring for a while, I returned to my own thoughts.</p>
<p>When the rowboat was approaching the steamboat, we encountered trouble with the soldiers escorting the boat.</p>
<p>This was in the autumn of 1931. Early the next morning, the boat entered the Wuxia Gorge, with its towering cliffs on both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Honest and Sincere People <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Bing</p>
<p>Luo Fu is an honest and sincere person; at least, he is confident in that himself. Although Luo Fu has lived in Shanghai for eight or nine years, and although Luo Fu has traveled to Hong Kong, Macau, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Jinan, Nanjing, Jiujiang, and other commercial ports within the Chinese territory besides Shanghai, and although Luo Fu has experienced many different types of jobs, such as teacher, contributor, political work in the military, and railway inspector, and although Luo Fu has also experienced various different ways of life, such as renting a room for twelve or thirteen yuan, and being so poor that he has nowhere to stand, perhaps no one will believe it when I say that Luo Fu can still be said to be an honest and sincere person now.</p>
<p>Luo Fu believes that he has a very deep understanding of worldly affairs and human relationships. Whether the relationship with someone is long or short, Luo Fu believes that he can judge good and evil, wisdom and foolishness clearly. However, there are many people who think that Luo Fu does not understand worldly affairs and human relationships and treat him as an easy person to bully. And Luo Fu really is bullied and played with once, twice, three times... to increase his experience.</p>
<p>"This person has no hope; he will always be a drifter. He doesn't know the rules of being a person at all." Many people, after bullying and playing with Luo Fu, turn around and seem to blame him with good intentions.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Luo Fu, when blamed, cannot say half a word in rebuttal, because the current society… especially Shanghai or other cities, simply doesn't need honest and sincere people. Honest and sincere people simply cannot stand in this kind of society. Luo Fu, when blamed, of course, cannot rebut others except to endure and blame himself.</p>
<p>Sometimes, because the wounds inflicted by being played with and bullied are too deep, and the lessons are too many, Luo Fu also wants to cheer up and be a person… naturally a modern person. A person who adapts to modern society, a person who can speak lies and deceive; in this way, perhaps he can also stand in this society.</p>
<p>"Hey! Are you going to Guangdong today?"</p>
<p>"No! I'm going to Hankou tomorrow."</p>
<p>"I heard that you have been very close to Mr. Huang lately. I think you will be successful in the near future."</p>
<p>"I don't know Mr. Huang. That person is very good at using methods; you must not be fooled by him."</p>
<p>Such a reply, knowingly affirming the truth yet denying it, others may think that Luo Fu is really good at being a person now and can speak hypocritical and deceptive words. So, in their hearts, they implicitly express admiration for Luo Fu, believing that he is a teachable son. However, only God will believe that when Luo Fu deliberately says these replies, knowingly affirming the truth yet denying it, because he is too deeply stimulated, Luo Fu's inner pain is unbearable, and it exceeds several times the severe trauma he suffers from treating people with a sincere heart, only to be played with by others using hypocritical and deceptive means, because this is not only deceiving others but perhaps also deceiving oneself. Why do I have to be hypocritical and deceptive in what I do and say to people! Thinking like this, perhaps Luo Fu will cry and kneel before the person who has heard Luo Fu's hypocritical and deceptive words, begging him to forgive him.</p>
<p>"What's going on with this; is he a lunatic!"</p>
<p>However, others are, after all, others. Others, after hearing Luo Fu's hypocritical and deceptive words, may not be able to realize that they are fake and think that Luo Fu is really treating people with a sincere heart. Perhaps they do realize that they are lies, but they admire Luo Fu's pain in being a human being. But now, instead of waiting for Luo Fu to speak the truth, and frankly confessing and repenting, they belittle him and think that Luo Fu's actions are inhuman. As a result, Luo Fu's sincere repentance is despised by others.</p>
<p>"This person really has no hope; he might as well commit suicide."</p>
<p>Although no one says so to his face, someone advocates this behind his back. Afterwards, when meeting Luo Fu, others will reveal contemptuous expressions or keep him at a distance out of respect.</p>
<p>Therefore, Luo Fu's experience of worldly affairs and human relationships, although rich, is ultimately useless to apply. If applied, it can only backfire and ruin his reputation as an honest and sincere person. For this reason, Luo Fu dares not tell even half a lie when dealing with people, and even if he accidentally says one or two wrong words, he has to quickly correct them, lest others think that he is playing tricks.</p>
<p>The honest and sincere person becomes even more deserving of his name, showing his honesty and sincerity.</p>
<p>As a result, Luo Fu's friends are only children or teenagers who are just beginning to understand worldly affairs because these people, like Luo Fu, treat people with honesty and sincerity. Birds of a feather flock together. Only then can they be in harmony with each other. However, when those children or teenagers grow up and understand worldly affairs, they will also treat people with hypocrisy and deception. Then, at that time, Luo Fu will be played with, bullied, and despised by those children or teenagers, and Luo Fu will become estranged from these former young children whom he regarded as children and teenagers. So, those who associate with him change to some new children and teenagers. However, when the future days arrive, those second batch (?) of children and teenagers become young gentlemen, and after understanding worldly affairs and human relationships, Luo Fu will only be able to get along with the third batch (?) of children and teenagers. Such a formula, the relay race of changing generals, has now been going on for eight or nine years. In these days, there has already been a fifth batch (?) of children and teenagers who have become the young gentlemen of today's society. However, Luo Fu is still not progressing. Luo Fu now can only get along with the sixth batch of children and teenagers.</p>
<p>Luo Fu will never be able to comprehend the most important lesson in life and society! Worldly affairs and human relationships will bear the nickname given to the honest and sincere person, all the way until the end of his life.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Nanyang Street One <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Black Infant</p>
<p>Flat and solid, paved with a layer of asphalt. No trees on either side, no tall, magnificent buildings. All are two or three-story buildings, and not very neat: some are old, and some are modern buildings. But you can probably tell that Chinese people will always love to do their business in old shops.</p>
<p>Those facing east prop up the white cloth awnings before the sun rises, to prevent the tropical sun from scorching them after an hour. On the cloth, the store names are painted in two or even three languages: you can imagine how different Chinese characters and Latin letters look side by side.</p>
<p>Gradually, there were more and more people on the street, and more and more cars. The people are very mixed: if you stand in the center of the road where the Malay police station is for twenty or thirty minutes, the following different kinds of humans will be displayed in front of you:</p>
<p>Yellow-faced Chinese and Japanese. Blue-eyed Germans, Dutch, British, Portuguese, Americans... Black Africans, Javanese... (You won't be able to tell them apart unless you have knowledge of ethnology.)</p>
<p>In the cars, sit the descendants of those who became rich from rubber plantations during the European War: when they think back to those good old days, they shake their heads and sigh. Carriages seem to be a special existence here, arousing the curiosity of some newcomers, who stare intently at the horses that set off and run forward with their four hooves, and at the coachman. Bicycles come and go in groups: sometimes you see young women riding them. Their skill and naturalness in driving are surprising, aren't they?</p>
<p>The elementary school students, carrying schoolbags, walk to school, smiling and rushing forward with a whoosh. If you walk in front of them, they will catch up with you in a while.</p>
<p>Children who grow up in Nanyang are always lively and lovely. Their active and energetic character teaches them to fight once a day. You may be surprised at the Malay police: why don't they interfere when they see children fighting? But, if you wait for ten minutes, the loser will obediently follow the person and walk their way.</p>
<p>The Javanese carts pushing "Ice Cream" and lemonade also appeared on the street, the bells ringing. Some people, regardless of whether they are thirsty or not, throw down three or five copper coins and have a cup of sweet iced water to drink. The Javanese, with a face full of beards, wearing gauze, slowly pushes and turns away from there.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Calligraphy Square (5) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Why</p>
<p>Seeing me hesitating and unable to choose, he helped me flip through it for a long time. Then, without even toasting the paper, without even taking off his boots, he helped me grind ink and cut paper. Because he was afraid of cutting the paper wrong, he carefully measured it again and again, folded it again and again. After the paper was cut, he used his fingers to draw fingerprints on it, and used his mother's powder to draw crosses on it, constantly saying:</p>
<p>You must write evenly and neatly, arrange the positions well, and especially write the couplets in straight lines, and avoid writing them upside down, crookedly...</p>
<p>A serious light was visible on his face, his wrinkled skin tightened and relaxed, constantly changing shape, and his lips seemed to be distorted by the stimulation of excessive excitement. While tightly clamping the new ink that he had specially bought, with his skinny hands, he glanced over the encyclopedia wrapped in a black cover, his mouth opening and closing, as if chanting in a low voice.</p>
<p>I also bought a new goat hair brush, a real calligraphy square brush, all for Uncle Zhang's sake!</p>
<p>Everything was arranged properly. Afterwards, as if opening an exhibition, my father went to invite several gentlemen from the neighborhood to watch me write. These people were all first-class figures in the village, engaging in iron-clad fraud and all kinds of evil. They didn't do any serious work all year round, but they were dressed exquisitely and ate exquisitely. They were not only despicable and disgusting, but also extremely arrogant. I have always disliked these benevolent officials, but my father invited them to watch me write, like supervisors, so my aversion to them increased even more.</p>
<p>I heard these parasites, who seemed to know everything and were shameless, constantly praising me:</p>
<p>Congratulations, congratulations, you have such a son, you are really extremely happy!</p>
<p>Several of them could not hide their envy and jealousy, and said:</p>
<p>Face! Uncle Zhang's face, what else is there to say?</p>

<h3 id="e240">Key Points for Recent Improvement of Colleges and Universities by the Ministry of Education (2) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>1. Reorganizing departments and faculties: In the past, when universities reorganized departments and faculties, they often set them up arbitrarily regardless of faculty and equipment, which affected other departments and faculties, and few achieved good results. Moreover, there were many overlapping departments and faculties in various schools, especially in Shanghai and Peiping. Taking Peiping as an example, in the 20th year of the Republic, there were a total of twelve public and private universities and independent colleges, divided into more than 30 colleges (the departments in independent colleges were regarded as colleges), and more than 130 departments. In terms of colleges, there were liberal arts colleges and law colleges, seven science colleges, and one or two colleges of agriculture, engineering, and medicine. In terms of departments, among the more than 130 departments, there were ten Chinese literature departments and economics departments, nine political science departments and foreign literature departments, seven law departments and physics departments, six history departments, philosophy departments, and mathematics departments, five education departments, sociology departments, and chemistry departments, four biology departments and psychology departments, and three geography departments and music departments. In addition, there were one or two departments in each of the other departments. The situation of overlapping departments and faculties in major universities in Shanghai was similar to that in Peiping. The duplication of departments and faculties in other provinces and cities was less common, but the Ministry of Education separately ordered them to be reduced or merged, or to stop recruiting new students and end them in stages. The philosophy and education departments of the Women's Liberal Arts College of Peiping University were abolished, the Chinese literature and history departments were merged into the literature and history department, and the business school and law school were merged and renamed the law and business school, with the business department, international trade, business administration, and transportation management departments. From this year onwards, no new students will be recruited. The sociology department of Peiping Normal University was abolished, the law department of Tsinghua University was abolished, the education college of Jinan University was abolished, and the original departments were merged into the education department and merged into the liberal arts college. The law school was abolished, and the original students were transferred to the law school of National Central University. The sociology department of Henan University stopped recruiting new students, the civil engineering department was abolished, the Chinese literature department and the history department were merged into the literature and history department, and the law school, except for the economics department, no longer enrolled students. After the existing students of the law and political science departments have finished their studies, the economics department will be merged into the liberal arts college. Shanxi Education College and Shanxi Law College were both merged into Shanxi University. The education college of Sichuan University was abolished and changed to the education department and merged into the liberal arts college. The mathematics and physics departments of Anhui University were merged into the mathematics and physics department, and the law school was abolished. The original students were either ordered to transfer schools or changed departments. Hebei Law and Business College completely stopped recruiting students. Other schools with duplicate departments and faculties and lack of faculty and equipment and unable to develop were ordered to draft their own plans for reduction and merger and submit them to the Ministry for approval. The purpose is to completely reduce duplication and adapt to actual needs, so that the manpower and financial resources of various schools can be concentrated to engage in special enrichment and development.</p>
<p>2. Enriching equipment: According to statistics in the 20th year of the Republic, the new equipment expenses for colleges and universities across the country were about 6.4 million yuan, about 6.2 million yuan in the 21st year, and about 6.5 million yuan recently. It can be seen that the new equipment expenses for various schools in recent years have been about 6.4 million yuan, which cannot be said to be a considerable progress. Among the 6.4 million yuan of new equipment expenses across the country in the 20th year of the Republic, library expenses accounted for 17%, and instruments, specimens, machines, etc. accounted for 26%, totaling 43%. The remaining 57% were mostly construction, repairs, and school equipment and miscellaneous expenses. Among the 6.2 million yuan of new equipment expenses in the 21st year, library expenses accounted for 31.8%. Recently, among the 6.5 million yuan of new equipment expenses, library expenses accounted for 19%, and instruments, specimens, machines, etc. accounted for 31.8%. Recently, among the 6.5 million yuan of new equipment expenses, library expenses accounted for 18.8%, and instruments, specimens, machines, etc. accounted for 31.8%. Recently, among the 6.5 million yuan of new equipment expenses, library expenses accounted for 19%, and instruments, specimens, machines, etc. accounted for 32%. If we compare the three years, the recent library expenses have increased by about 2% compared with the 20th year, and about 0.2% compared with the 21st year. The expenses for instruments, standards, machines, etc. have increased by about 5.6% compared with the 20th year, and about 0.2% compared with the 21st year. It can be seen that various schools have indeed made considerable increases in the equipment of books and instruments. However, this increase refers to the overall situation. Individually, most of them still do not meet the statutory standards, especially private schools. According to the regulations, the equipment expenses of universities should account for at least 15% of the operating expenses, and the administrative expenses should not exceed 10%. Therefore, colleges and universities should strive to reduce administrative expenses and strive to increase equipment expenses. In addition to separately ordering various schools to seek practical enrichment of equipment such as instruments and books, the Ministry of Education has approved that equipment expenses account for 81.5% of the subsidies for private colleges and universities this year. This is the meaning of paying special attention to equipment.</p>

Lecture fees are limited to purchasing specialized instruments, machines, specimens, models, equipment, medicines, and books. 7. The subsidies are issued monthly by the Ministry of Education. 8. After receiving the subsidies, each school should immediately fill out the receipt and submit it.

<h3 id="e245">Judging Procedures for the National Elementary School Chinese Language Competition <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The National Chinese Language Education Promotion Association founded the National Elementary School Chinese Language Competition. The Ministry of Education has issued a notice. It is said that the judging procedures of the association are divided into three types: preliminary selection, re-examination, and final selection. The judging meeting passed the procedures yesterday. Now we will explore the records below. Preliminary selection: The competition papers of public and private elementary schools in various provinces, cities, and counties across the country have been collected by the education departments and bureaus of various counties, provinces, and cities as per the order of the Ministry of Education, and the best two papers in each group will be selected before November 1, the 23rd year of the Republic, and sent to the office of the National Chinese Language Education Promotion Association at Pingle Temple, Xizang Road, Shanghai. When the association receives the papers, it will immediately issue a text to the National Elementary School Chinese Language Competition Committee of the association (hereinafter referred to as the Competition Committee).

Last month (September), tennis players from all over Java competed in Batavia, and Mr. Xu won the singles championship, but the doubles was a complete failure, which was regrettable to all parties. Recently, the Japanese Association in Surabaya (another major city in Java) launched another public tennis tournament in Surabaya. This time, there were participants from all countries in the men's singles, and there were particularly many, totaling 46 people, which can be described as extremely grand. However, as a result of the competition, the men's singles championship was still won by Mr. Xu, which is not surprising. However, the men's doubles was also won by Mr. Xu and Lin Xuyin, so the local overseas Chinese were very excited and asked the reporter to report it to the sports community in China.</p>

After that, the Sanyou team launched attacks from all sides, but because Jin Cheng's Gao Tongbai and Zhu Bingqi were well-defended, there was no gap to attack. In the first half, Jin Cheng won 24-16. After the lemon break, Jin Cheng replaced fresh troops to play. Gao Tongbai, the defender, switched to center, so the Sanyou team took the opportunity to counterattack, scoring six points in a row. The Jin Cheng team then brought in Yao, Lou, and Zhu to participate in the battle, and they were all successful, so they ended with a score of 44-24, with Jin Cheng winning.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Words and Actions <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>One who is sick and refuses medicine often meets a mediocre doctor. Those with average talent often meet mediocre people. Those who are known to be talented, if they do not do good, will do evil, and will never be content to live a mediocre life. Doing good is mostly for others, while doing evil is only for oneself. Those with talent would rather do evil. The more talent one has, the more capable one is of doing evil. Those who are good at it show only the good and conceal the evil. Evil is embellished by good. That is why Laozi and Zhuangzi advocated the elimination of sagehood and knowledge.</p>
<p>However, Laozi and Zhuangzi were also extremely intelligent people. A Dao De Jing, a Zhuangzi, reveal the secrets of the human world, and are extremely thorough. In theory, evil should be reduced. But from another point of view, it is no different from teaching a monkey to climb a tree, which cannot reduce evil, but instead encourages it. This may be the bitter truth they wanted to say but did not. If words were converted into actions, they could become the greatest treachery.</p>
<p>Like these two, they are living examples, like understanding the principle of cloth curtains, yet also covering themselves with a layer of cloth curtain. Clever people will say, "Today's me is not yesterday's me," flipping their tongues and transforming themselves. In fact, they are also tearing off the cloth curtain and replacing it with another layer, or simply revealing their true form.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Wushan <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Guang</p>
<p>In the twilight of dusk, the boat slowly anchored at Wushan. The passengers had already strolled onto the deck, some holding pipes, some yawning, some paying attention to the tea attendants' instructions, and all gazing curiously at the side of the riverbank where the castle was located, as if they could find some eye-catching architecture and lively markets.</p>
<p>However, all that met their eyes was a glaring desolation.</p>
<p>The city squatted on top of a not-very-tall earthen hill, low and pitiful. It seemed that it was deliberately squatting high, not to show the characteristics of a mountain city, but to allow people to appreciate its decay and backwardness. That is to say, in the continuous turmoil and under poor natural conditions, a town that is based on an important river line is how it is on the verge of extinction.</p>
<p>The observers shook their heads and already showed a disappointed expression. They didn't seem to feel any interest at all. A young man who looked like he was out for the first time stared wide-eyed and muttered to himself:</p>
<p>Oh, so that's it? He even gave a bitter laugh from his nose.</p>
<p>Many people returned to their berths. From the turbid river, three or four gray-brown boats were lazily floating over. But there was neither the clamor of selling food nor the call of soliciting customers. It seemed that the purpose of those boat owners was just to rush over to share a bit of the so-called excitement of the world. However, because of this sporadic embellishment, the river seemed even more desolate.</p>
<p>Is anyone going ashore? People who stayed on the deck asked each other with boredom.</p>
<p>Come to the back, come to the back. The small boat then rowed harder towards the stern of the steamboat.</p>
<p>Don't delay, or you'll cause trouble! The boat soldiers urged each of the passengers going ashore.</p>
<p>When I, together with a tea attendant and two small-time opium merchants, were in a dilapidated boat, the night was gradually deepening. A kind of eerie feeling surrounded us. But, although the place where we were moored was still in the middle of this long gorge, the eeriness was the desolation of Guanghan, and did not carry the deepness and solemnity that should be in the mountain gorge. Because the mountain range rushing down from the upper reaches seemed to suddenly collapse here, leaving only some earthen hills and small mountains, and a stretch of rocky riverbank.</p>
<p>Hey, Fangfang pointed the empty wine bottle on the boat and shouted, you should also spend some money to repair it.</p>
<p>Easy to say, repair it...</p>
<p>As if strangely blaming the accuser for not knowing the situation, the boatman did not finish his sentence, then lazily turned his head and took care of his own oars.</p>
<p>This was an old man in his fifties, with a sandy white beard and a dark, wrinkled face. He lazily wielded his old oars inlaid with new wood, his waist stretching and bending, half-closed eyes, as if his work was not for food, but to pass the time he had already lived through. Due to the tea attendant's urgent urging, the boat was soon anchored.</p>
<p>Old man, I asked the boatman, who now only needed to take care of the direction of the boat, I heard that the bandit has come again?</p>
<p>Yes, it's happening again. The army just left a few days ago.</p>
<p>Then the two opium merchants shifted their bodies and began to show off their knowledge. In such a conversation, the boat sailed to the shore. So, walking across a sandy beach mixed with gravel and walking up the sloping path, we entered that desolate county town.</p>
<p>However, speaking of the county town, its size and liveliness were actually not comparable to the market towns in other areas. Moreover, it still maintained the old appearance of all the small towns in the past: narrow streets, low houses, and bamboo poles for drying clothes and firewood to be split across the streets. A little boy, with one hand holding up his pants and one hand holding a rattan whip-like tow rope, cried out and ran towards several frantically running piglets.</p>
<p>On the steps of several teahouses, there were stoves and equipment for cooking opium. The two opium merchants went to discuss their business seriously, and the tea attendant disappeared under the eaves of a dark cave. And I, who was already very depressed at that time, wandered alone in the market until I gathered my companions, the opium merchant and the tea attendant, at the gate of the city.</p>
<p>We stepped on the steep return path again, but I was still oppressed by a kind of restless mood.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, look up! The tea attendant suddenly greeted me with a laughing tone, while opening his electric torch.</p>
<p>Following the direction of the light, I looked up at the top of the electric pole on the side of the road: there hung three terrible things that had already lost their color of blood. But I did not panic as my companions had hoped. After staring for a while, I returned to my own thoughts.</p>
<p>When the boat was approaching the steamboat, we encountered trouble from the ship-guarding soldiers.</p>
<p>This was in the autumn of 1931. Early the next morning, the boat entered the Wuxia Gorge with cliffs on both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e274">An Honest and Sincere Man <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Bing</p>
<p>Luo Fu is an honest and sincere person; at least, he is confident in this about himself. Although Luo Fu has lived in Shanghai for eight or nine years, and although, besides Shanghai, Luo Fu has also traveled to Hong Kong, Macau, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Jinan, Nanjing, Jiujiang, and other commercial ports within the Chinese territory, and although Luo Fu has experienced many different kinds of occupations, such as teacher, contributor, political work in the military, railway inspector, and the like, and Luo Fu has also experienced various different ways of life, such as renting a room for twelve or thirteen yuan, and being so poor as to have nowhere to stand, yet, it may be hard to believe, Luo Fu can still be said to be an honest and sincere person to this day.</p>
<p>Luo Fu considers himself to have a very deep understanding of worldly wisdom and human relationships, and he believes that he can clearly judge good and evil, wisdom and foolishness, regardless of the length of time he interacts with people. However, many people think that Luo Fu does not understand worldly wisdom and human relationships and treat him as someone easy to deceive. And Luo Fu has indeed been deceived and played with, once, twice, three times… to increase his experiences.</p>
<p>This person is hopeless; he will always be a wandering pauper. He doesn't even know the basic rules of life. Many people, after deceiving and playing with Luo Fu, turn around and blame him in a seemingly well-intentioned way.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Luo Fu could not say half a word in rebuttal after being blamed, because the current society... especially Shanghai or other cities, simply does not need honest and sincere people. Honest and sincere people simply cannot stand a foothold in this kind of society. After being blamed, Luo Fu, of course, could not refute others, except to endure it and complain to himself.</p>
<p>Sometimes, because the wounds given by being played with and deceived were too deep, and the lessons too many, Luo Fu also wanted to buck up a bit, to be a person... a modern person, of course, a person who adapts to modern society, a person who can tell lies and deceive. In that way, perhaps he could also stand a foothold in this society.</p>
<p>Hey! Are you going to Guangdong today?</p>
<p>No! I'm going to Hankou tomorrow.</p>
<p>I heard you've been very close to Mr. Huang recently. I think you'll be successful in the near future.</p>
<p>I don't know Mr. Huang. This person is very good at using tricks. You must not fall for his tricks.</p>
<p>Such knowingly false answers, others might think that Luo Fu is really good at dealing with people, able to tell hypocritical and deceptive words. Therefore, they also secretly express admiration for Luo Fu, thinking that this child is teachable. However, only God believes that when Luo Fu deliberately says these knowingly false answers because of deep stimulation, Luo Fu's inner pain is unbearable, and it exceeds the severe trauma caused by treating people with loyalty and sincerity, only to be played with by others with hypocritical and deceptive means by several times, because this is not only deceiving others, but perhaps also deceiving himself. Why do I have to be hypocritical and deceptive in what I do and what I say to people! Thinking like this, Luo Fu might cry and kneel in front of the person who heard Luo Fu's hypocritical and deceptive words, begging him to forgive him.</p>
<p>What's going on, is he crazy!</p>
<p>However, others are, after all, others. When others hear Luo Fu's hypocritical and deceptive words, they may not even realize that they are not true and think that he is truly treating people with loyalty and sincerity, or they may realize that they are false words, and admire Luo Fu's shrewdness in dealing with people. But now, waiting for Luo Fu to tell the truth, and frankly self-report, repent, but instead despise him and think that Luo Fu's behavior is inhuman. As a result, Luo Fu's sincere repentance is despised by others.</p>
<p>This person is really hopeless; he might as well commit suicide.</p>
<p>Although no one said so to his face, some people advocated this behind his back. Later, when they met Luo Fu, they would show contempt or keep a respectful distance.</p>
<p>Therefore, Luo Fu's experience in worldly wisdom and human relationships, although rich, is ultimately useless. If he tries to apply it, he will only mess things up and damage his reputation as an honest and sincere man. This reason makes Luo Fu afraid to tell even half a lie when dealing with people in the future, and even if he accidentally says a word or two wrong, he must quickly correct it, lest others think he is playing tricks.</p>
<p>An honest and sincere man increasingly lives up to his name.</p>
<p>Therefore, Luo Fu's only friends are children or young people who are just beginning to understand the world, because these people, like Luo Fu, treat people with honesty and sincerity. Birds of a feather flock together, and they can understand each other. However, when those children or young people grow up and understand the world, they will also treat people with hypocrisy and deception. Then, Luo Fu will be played with, deceived, and despised by those children or young people. Luo Fu will become estranged from these young gentlemen whom he once regarded as children and young people. Then, he will associate with a new group of children and young people. But when the future comes, and those second batch (?) of children and young people become young gentlemen and understand worldly wisdom and human relationships, Luo Fu will only be able to associate with the third batch (?) of children and young people. Such a formula, a revolving door of replacements, has been going on for eight or nine years now. During these years, the fifth batch (?) of children and young people have become young gentlemen in today's society, but Luo Fu still does not improve. Luo Fu is now only associating with the sixth batch of children and young people.</p>
<p>Luo Fu will never be able to gain any experience in the most important lesson in life and society! He will carry this nickname given to honest and sincere people until the end of his life.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Streets of Nanyang (1) <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Smoothly, solidly, paved with a layer of asphalt. No trees on either side, no tall, magnificent buildings. All are two- or three-story buildings, and not very tidy: some are old, some are modern buildings. But you can probably know that the Chinese will always love to do their business in old shops.</p>
<p>Those facing east put up the white canvas awnings before the sun rises, to prevent the tropical sun from baking them an hour later. On the canvas, the shop name is painted in two or even three languages: you can imagine how different Chinese characters and Latin letters are when put together.</p>
<p>Gradually, there are more and more people on the street, and more and more cars. The people are extremely mixed: if you stand in the center of the road where the Malay police station stands and watch for twenty or thirty minutes, you will see the following different kinds of humans displayed in front of you:</p>
<p>Yellow-faced Chinese and Japanese. Blue-eyed Germans, Dutch, British, Portuguese, Americans…. Black Africans, Kling people…. (You won't be able to tell them apart without some knowledge of ethnology.)</p>
<p>In the cars, sit the descendants of those who became rich from rubber plantations during the European War: when they think back to those good old days, they all shake their heads and sigh. Horse-drawn carriages seem to be a special existence here, arousing the curiosity of some newcomers, who stare unblinkingly at the horses galloping forward and the coachmen. Bicycles come and go in droves: sometimes you see young women riding them. Their skill and naturalness in driving must be surprising to everyone, right?</p>
<p>Elementary school students carrying schoolbags walk to school, piling on smiling faces, rushing forward with a whoosh. If you are walking in front of them, they will catch up with you in a moment.</p>
<p>Children growing up in Nanyang are always lively and adorable. An active, assertive personality makes them have to fight once a day. You may be surprised to go to the Malay police: why don't they interfere when they see children fighting? But, wait ten minutes, and the loser will follow the others meekly on their way.</p>
<p>The small carts of the Kling people selling ice cream and lemonade also appear on the street, the bells ringing ding-ding. Some people, regardless of whether they are thirsty or not, drop three or five copper coins and have a cup of sweet ice water to drink. The Kling people, with a face full of beards, slowly push the gauze-covered carts and turn the corner.</p>

<p>— Wei He</p>
<p>Seeing me hesitating and unable to choose, he helped me flip through it again and again for half a day. Then, without even drying the inkstone, without even taking off his boots, he helped me grind the ink, cut the paper, because he was afraid of cutting the paper wrong, he measured it again and again carefully, folded it again and again, and after the paper was cut, he used his fingers to draw fingerprints on it, and used his mother's face powder to draw crosses on it, constantly saying:</p>
<p>You have to write evenly and neatly, arrange the positions well, especially the couplets must be written in a straight line, and be careful not to write them upside down, crooked…</p>
<p>A solemn light appeared on his face, his wrinkled skin tightening and loosening, constantly changing shape, his lips also seemed to be distorted by the stimulation of excessive excitement. While using his skinny hands to tightly clamp the new ink that he had specially fetched, he glanced with his two rat-like eyes at the encyclopedia wrapped in a black cover, his mouth opening and closing, as if he was chanting in a low voice.</p>
<p>I also bought a new sheep hair brush, a real square calligraphy brush, all for Uncle Zhang's sake!</p>
<p>Everything was arranged properly. Afterwards, like opening some kind of exhibition, my father went to invite several gentlemen from the neighborhood to watch me write. These people were all first-class characters in the village, running scams and doing all kinds of evil. They didn't do any real work all year round, but they were all dressed up and ate well, not only despicable and vulgar, but also arrogant to the extreme. I have always looked down on these parasites, but my father invited them to watch me write calligraphy, like proctors, so my aversion to them increased even more.</p>
<p>I heard these parasites, who seemed to know everything and had no shame, praising me incessantly:</p>
<p>Congratulations, congratulations, you have such a son, you are truly blessed!</p>
<p>Several others, unable to hide their feelings, said in envious and jealous tones:</p>
<p>It's all about face! Uncle Zhang's face, what else is there to say?</p>

<h3 id="e277">Bullion Rises, Silver Falls, Standard Gold Continues to Rise by $1.20 <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Market Conditions Unstable, Recorded at Around 80 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw a rise in bullion due to shrinking overseas silver markets and exchange rates. Public sentiment remained stable, and as unfavorable news had not been confirmed by newspapers, buyers were still active and prices rose. However, the future showed signs of change, with many potential headwinds. In the early morning, overseas silver markets shrank in both the UK and the US, and the forward price of silver in Monte Carlo also decreased. The price of spot gold in London rose by two pence, and exchange rates also fell, causing slight anxiety. Off-market pre-market trading opened and immediately rose to $83.40. The central bank's official rates were announced, with the UK and the US unchanged, and the customs gold unit rising by 3 li. The forbidden gold standard price was set at $992.50, opening at a high. Unfortunately, major players took advantage of the high prices to sell aggressively, and banks were also hesitant, gradually falling back within the $80 mark. However, as Chinese merchants continued to buy, and the HSBC official rates were announced, with the UK unchanged and the US shrinking by 0.0625, the exchange rate was able to recover slightly, and the price of gold gradually rose again. However, the rising trend was difficult to sustain, and selling pressure remained latent, with sellers becoming active again, and prices falling back within the $80 mark. The domestic market also hardened accordingly. At this time, the situation suddenly weakened, but the overall trend was not downward, and buyers appeared when prices were low, gradually rising back above the $80 mark. At noon, the situation was quite stable. The afternoon market opened steadily, but public sentiment was clearly bullish, and major players had a renewed appetite for buying. The supply side lacked momentum, and short positions also started to panic, rising at one point. However, banks continued to supply, and sellers became active again after that. However, as Indian silver prices were reported to be shrinking by five annas, the market remained hesitant. The exchange rate gradually hardened, and major players re-emerged, and sellers became active again, causing the price of gold to fall. Later, some short covering at low prices managed to pull the price up. Indian silver prices recovered by one anna. At this point, the market was swirling and very mediocre, with small investors covering their positions, and the underlying trend remained stable. Ultimately, as the domestic market had hardened, it failed to return to a firm upward path. After the close of the market, rumors re-emerged about the abolition of the 10% additional tax on silver. Market conditions were unstable throughout the day, and the trend was generally subdued. The day's market activity is recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was $95, an increase of $3.60 compared to last Saturday. Fuxing Yong continued to sell heavily, and Dafa Yongqing Yuhang Changyong Fuyu Huixiang also sold. Citibank and Huabi sold US dollars for January at 1.875, gradually declining, falling back to $79. Dongya had already sold US dollars for December at 2.5. Fuyu, Dafa, Yongyuan Mao, Yongtian Feng, and others still bought, and prices rose again. It was pre-known that HSBC's official rates would be unchanged for the UK and shrink by 0.0625 for the US, gradually rising back to $82.40. Fuxing Yong Dafa Yong sold off, and Huishu sold US dollars for February at 1.875, falling back to 0.07. Hengxing Yuan Hengchang Yong Zhengchang still bought, rising to $1.90. Fuxing Yong Dafa Yong still supplied, and prices fell again to 0.05. Later, Shunmao, Fuxing Yong, Dafa Yong, Dalianbang, and others bought frantically, and prices rose to $4.40. Tongchun Qingyu Hongkang Yongfuchang Yuanmao Yong Dingchang and others sold together, breaking the $80 mark. The bank was willing to sell US dollars for January at 3.125, and prices fell to $77.50. Fuxing Yong bought at low prices, rising to $9, but as Dingkang Yuanmao Yong and others continued to sell, prices fell back to $7.80. Tongchun Fuxing Yong Hengyu Yuanmao Yong Bingxing Dalianbang and others continuously bought, gradually pulling prices up, and actually rising back to $83.30. Although Fuchang and others supplied, prices fell back within $2, but the overall trend was stable, and the noon closing price was $982.80.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $982.80, and public sentiment was bullish, gradually rising from $2.30. Tongchun Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Yongfeng Zhaofengchang and others bought, and prices rose to $6.10. Citibank and Huabi sold US dollars for January at 1.875. Fuyu Qingyu Dalianbang Qianchangxiang Fuxing Yong Yuanfeng Yong and others sold within $5. Mumbai was down five annas. Zhentai Dadecheng still bought, rising to $5. Fuxing Yong Dafa Yong still sold, and prices fell back to $3.70. Shunli bought up to $5.20. The domestic market hardened, and McCallie came out with US dollars for December at 3.125. Yuanmao Yong Wanxing sold and prices fell. Dafa Yong came up and sold aggressively, falling further back to $1.50. Yicheng Zhaofengchang Fuchang and others still bought at low prices, rising again to $3. After that, the situation was ambiguous. Mumbai telegraphed a second time, reporting a recovery of one anna. Fuxing Yong supplied, and prices fell back to $1.40. However, as Yuanmao Yong Yuanchang Yong and others still bought, prices gradually rose above $3. Fuyu Yong Dafa Yong and others had mixed positions, and market prices were extremely volatile. Ultimately, as the exchange rate eased, US dollars could be settled at 3.75, and the closing price still fell back from $3.40 to $982.60. After the market closed, Dafa Yong Fuxing Yong and others bought, and prices rose to $4.50. Then, Fuxing Yong Yuanmao Yong and others sold aggressively, gradually falling back to around $1. The news that the 10% additional tax on silver would soon be abolished spread again in the market. It has not changed. It was found that the highest price during the day was $986.70 and the lowest price was $977.50, with a fluctuation of $9.20. As a result, it rose back $1.20 compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The closing price was set at $992.50, the standard price of gold announced by the Central Bank. According to the closing price, it was about $10 less, almost the same as last Saturday. The old settlement price for November, based on HSBC's US exchange rate shrinking by 0.0625, was $32.5625, equivalent to a standard gold price of over $1062. The registered price for November was $985, and for December was $983. The morning interest was $985, and the same price in the afternoon. The price of pure gold was $995. Market transactions were stable. It was only heard that Yingfeng Heng and the Tianjin Township Association were doing a clearing transaction of more than 300 taels, with an additional $12.50. Spot goods arrived in Tianjin one after another. The Tianjin gang swapped spots at the standard price, about 3,000 taels done by Yingfeng Heng, with Yingfeng Heng paying the Tianjin gang less than $12. The swap was done by Yuan Yi paying Dadecheng 0.1 tael, and Dafeng Heng paying 49 taels, flat swap. In addition, Shengda allocated 280 taels of November notes to Yingfeng Heng, priced at $980.50. There were 8,064 taels of November notes remaining.</p>
<p>Market transactions were normal. The selling force was the strongest. In summary, Dafa Yong Yuanmao Yong Fuxing Yong Hongkang Yong Hengtai Richang Dachangxiang Yuanchun Wanxing and others were on the selling side. Tongchun Shunli Shunmao Renfa Yong Hengchang Yong Runchang Yugan Changxiang Chang Sheng Yong Futai Heng Yongfeng Zhaofengchang Hengyu Changxiang and others were on the buying side. Kangtian Feng was first in and then out. Dadecheng Hengxing Yuan Dingchang was first out and then in. Dalianbang Wanxing had a total of more than 1,300 taels, clearing out more than 200 taels.

The total number of transactions on that day was 30,037 taels in the morning and 20,237 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Chinese Merchants' Appetite Weak, Foreign Exchange Tightens Slightly, Then Eases <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, London's large notes shrank by 0.0625 for both near and far terms. American silver fell by 0.125. The forward price of silver fell by 0.05 to 0.01. The pound fell by 0.075 against the dollar, and the dollar fell by 0.0375 against the pound. The pound was unchanged against the franc, and the dollar fell by 0.075 against the franc. The price of spot gold in London rose by 0.025 pence. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices, with the pound at 1 shilling and 4 pence 0.0625, and the dollar at $33.1875. Forward terms were the same. The central bank's official rates were announced, with the UK and the US unchanged, and the customs gold rising by 0.03. Although Chinese merchants were buying, the market eased due to bank supply. The official exchange rates were announced by the selling banks, with the UK unchanged and the US shrinking by 0.0625. Chinese merchants were still buying, and the market seemed tight, but the banks had a strong selling appetite. The process was mediocre. Later, the overall trend was ambiguous, changing with the gold market. The afternoon market was once tight, but as banks continued to supply and Indian silver shrank, the market still hardened. After being forced, Chinese merchants' buying interest disappeared, and the process became even harder. By the close of the market, the near-term selling prices were: the pound at 1 shilling and 4 pence 0.125, and the dollar at $33.375, a total of 0.0625 easing for both the pound and the dollar compared to last Saturday afternoon. After the market closed, the rumor that the 10% additional tax on silver would soon be abolished was circulating again, but there was no change. Chinese merchants had mixed appetites, and the clearing volume was not large. The overall trend of the day seemed to be loosening, which was also due to the banks' appetite. The day's trading is recorded below:</p>
<p>The pound opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 4 pence 0.0625. HSBC bought back October 0.125. Huabi sold November 0.0625.

<h3 id="e279">Late-Cycle Long-Term Rates Less Appealing Than Four-Point Lows <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>In today's economic downturn, it is not easy for the banking and money-changing industries to develop. Therefore, this long-term rate is less appealing than the previous four-point low. Yesterday, banks only made over 2.8 million, while money changers made over 5 million. The foreign interbank lending rate also did not improve as a result, with both morning and afternoon markets at 6 points, with an additional 2 points for overdrawn accounts. In the morning market, there were over 3.9 million in transferred and new transactions of draft tickets, and over 400,000 in the afternoon market. There were over 600,000 in small association transactions, and over 1.2 million in foreign collateral transactions, with over 1.8 million in new transactions. Banks collected and settled over 1.5 million in foreign exchange, over 1.2 million in month-end settlements, and 600,000 in warehouse releases. Chinese merchants collected and settled over 4.5 million in bank drafts, over 5.1 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral and miscellaneous settlements, over 800,000 in customs duties, over 5.4 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral and miscellaneous settlements, over 4.5 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 1.2 million in settlements and collections, and 600,000 in warehouse entries. Money changers collected and settled over 66 million in foreign public notes, over 9.4 million in foreign loans, over 900,000 in various remittances, over 800,000 in banknotes recovered, over 1.6 million issued, over 500,000 received in cash, 300,000 from customer sources, and 400,000 in expenses. The total exchange at the clearing house on the 29th was 37,710,440 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen in silver dollars, including 6,900,085 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen in silver dollars, and 30,809,582 yuan and 7 fen in silver dollar drafts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the early market price for Jiangnan fractional coins initially fell by $1.50, trading at $824.50. The afternoon market recovered to $826, so the result was the same as the previous day. The number of transactions was 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 6,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The early market price for Guangdong fractional coins once reached 50 guan, at $750. The afternoon market fell slightly to $749.80, so the result was about 7 jiao higher than the previous day. The number of transactions was 140,000 jiao in the morning market and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins was 322,000 wen, which was also about 500 wen higher than the previous day. The transaction price was $11,500 in silver dollars, totaling 37,030 strings of wen.</p>

<p>Today's Addition to be Auctioned for December Futures</p>
<p>Yesterday, October 29th, was the settlement date for public bonds at the Chinese Securities Exchange. Everything proceeded smoothly, and the total settlement amount was not very large, totaling 40,279,500 yuan. Among this, various brokers settled accounts themselves, accounting for 32,165,000 yuan. The amount settled at the exchange was only 10,630,000 yuan. The majority of both deliveries and receipts were from the financial sector, with retail investors remaining a minority. Upon investigation, although there were fluctuations in October futures, the ups and downs were also significant, but the high-low difference resulted in only two or three yuan. It can be called the most stable season. The environment, cash outflow, gradually became scarce and eventually curbed by increased taxes. Foreign exchange rates gradually declined from a high level. Tensions between Japan and Russia eased. Banditry was subdued from rampant to peaceful. The Sichuan rebellion was merely a fleeting moment. Shi Yousan's rebellion in Tianjin was not worth mentioning. Since the easing of tensions between Japan and Russia, Huang Fu's trip to the north, and the silver tax increase, Northern financiers have turned from short to long positions, resulting in steady improvement. However, due to the postponement of the Fifth Plenary Session, the news spread from rumor to reality, and public bond prices rose and fell with environmental news. The movement was limited at that time. The future trend is currently still in a period of brewing. The driving force for the coming changes is predicted to be greater than before. Today, additional December futures will be auctioned. The settlement of October futures, the clearing of accounts, and the transaction volume are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market initially rose but then weakened. Trading in the market felt exceptionally quiet. Both the long and short sides maintained a wait-and-see attitude. However, the bulls in the financial sector had not yet fully released their positions. Sales floors reported yarn factory announcements, resulting in some buying activity. The market slightly tightened. In the afternoon, news of a weak gold market led to a market correction.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Golden Rooster Initially Lively, Then Weakened <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>The tagged yarn market opened lively in the morning, due to the yarn factories convening a meeting the previous day and issuing a statement. The factories had representatives petitioning in Beijing, and if they were unsuccessful, they might have to cease operations. As a result, some bulls purchased, with Dafu continuing to buy. Prices rose by eight or nine jiao to one yuan each. After two or three rounds of auctions, with weak buying interest, the market gradually declined again. In the end, prices rose by one or two jiao each. In the afternoon, it was heard that only 1,200 bales of spot yarn were traded, and the cotton market softened again. Prices fell by two, four, and seven jiao in each month. The total daily transaction volume was 23,350 bales. Upon investigation, 500 bales were sold by Jifeng, 650 bales by Tongji, 850 bales by Dafeng, 450 bales by Changji, 1,150 bales by Renfeng, 500 bales by Yichang, 1,950 bales by Changfeng, 450 bales by Xiecheng, 650 bales by Dachang, 1,250 bales by Xincheng, and 650 bales by Hengde. 900 bales were bought by Tongji, 1,800 bales by Dafu, 650 bales by Gengfeng, 750 bales by Yuande, 2,700 bales by Runkang, 400 bales by Junchang, 850 bales by Yichang, and 400 bales by Dachang.

<p>Cotton trends are weakening, with American cotton softening and exchange rates stabilizing. Various sources are gradually becoming abundant, and most industry players are shorting. However, the market is slightly helped by financial circles buying on dips. Spot cotton sales are average.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Zheng Tags: Each Fell 3.5 Jiao <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>The tagged flower market opened in the morning, with the American and Indian cotton markets weak, and rumors of yarn factories suspending operations spreading in the market. As a result, the market sentiment was weaker, with each month falling by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao. The market remained flat in the afternoon, with each month falling by another 0.5 to 1.5 jiao. The total daily transaction volume was 60,700 dan. Upon investigation, 1,100 dan were sold by Yuanda, 1,800 dan by Jifeng, 2,700 dan by Tongji, 4,400 dan by Dafeng, 1,000 dan by Suilong, 1,100 dan by Jinchang, 1,200 dan by Yuanda, 1,100 dan by Shenji, 3,700 dan by Changfeng, and 1,200 dan by Changhe. 1,300 dan were bought by Jifeng, 3,500 dan by Dafu, 1,000 dan by Yuanda, 1,300 dan by Yuanxingchang, 1,300 dan by Yiguan, 2,200 dan by Hengyi, 1,200 dan by Huikang, 1,100 dan by Yuanda, and 2,100 dan by Yichang.

<p>During the past week's futures market, buyers' interest was unusually low. Short covering and increased long positions by thoughtful investors were the key factors for stable market prices. Inquiries from Far East and European exporters were constant. Japan and China purchased superior grade Aojuan spicy aged cotton. Japan also showed interest in new cotton. Italy purchased large quantities for immediate shipment. Lancashire bought slightly, important, detailed grades. Trading was hesitant there due to high standard prices. The weather was good every day. There was progress in the Kangbaidi cotton area. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<h3 id="e289">Grain: Imported Wheat Continues to Stabalize; Mid-Term Flour Good, then Ultimately Falls <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month presented a trend of initial liveliness followed by a decline. Imported wheat quotations from Chicago and Canada were lower by one or two jiao. When prices opened, the current month looked good, and factories continued to replenish stocks, so the opening price was lively. The current month rose to 4.8 jiao, and November rose to 5 jiao, about two fen higher than the previous day. The forward month was about one fen higher. However, after the second round of trading, rumors spread that a certain factory had continued to order two ships of Argentine imported wheat, priced at 4.96 yuan. Due to the sudden surge in selling, the market turned sharply downward, and prices in both the near and forward months fell sharply. When the market opened in the afternoon, the trend for the current month was hovering, and the forward month was still soft because factories were still selling. Considering this situation, if imported wheat is actually traded, or if other factories also place orders, there may be changes in the future. As a result, the current month fell by 2.25 fen compared to the previous week, November fell by 3.5 fen, December fell by 2.75 fen, January fell by 4 fen, February fell by 3.5 fen, and March fell by 4.75 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Wheat Futures Follow Flour Market from Rise to Fall <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, the prices for each month presented a trend of initial rise followed by a decline. The current month has already been delivered. After the November price opened, the situation was very good, reaching a high of 4.02 yuan, and October reached 4.08 yuan. However, after the second round of trading, due to the decline of the flour market and the rumors of factories continuing to order two or three ships of imported wheat, the morale of outside investors suddenly declined. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market continued to decline, and the selling atmosphere for each ship became smooth. Future ups and downs will depend on the actual situation of imported wheat. As a result, the current month fell by 2 fen, December fell by 4 fen, January fell by 4 fen, and February fell by 3 fen. The spot wheat market is still holding up. High-quality goods are better by two or three fen, and medium-quality goods are stable. Shandong wheat opened at 3.88 yuan, Xuzhou wheat at 3.88 yuan, and Liuhe wheat at 3.84 yuan, totaling 5,000 bags, which were reportedly bought by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Before the Chicago market opened, all the news favored the long side, such as wheat being used to feed livestock. When the market opened, the spot market was strong, so the market was very firm, but prices were slightly lower. The Canadian government's intentions regarding wheat trading were unclear, so the market felt uneasy. Winnipeg was also affected. At present, local market prices are easily affected by overseas market conditions. After the Far East sold off, prices fell by more than half a point. Commentators believe that the strength of the spot market is an important force in maintaining market prices.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The sources for each area are still only about twenty. (The total goods are more than 3,000 shi.) Local buyers are strong, and the sales to Qingdao, Yantai, and other areas are also active. About seven or eight hundred bags were sold. Sellers shouted out prices, and the overall situation showed a rise. Until the market closed, there was no setback. The price of kiln varieties such as the Six Types and Baige new thin rice rose by one jiao. Thick new Japonica rice increased by two chi. Only wild rice and Feijing rice had more supply, with little increase or decrease. Duyangjian and Yinyuan also followed suit, with slight increases of one or two jiao, while Bianyuan sales were flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sixteen or seventeen ships arrived from the river areas. Various goods in the market were in demand. New Japonica rice, broken Japonica rice, kiln-dried rice, aged Baiyuan rice were selling well in retail. New Dujian rice was average, and the demand for new Yangjian rice and new Chenbu Kejian rice was strong. Yinyuan rice continued to be in demand. In terms of market conditions, the price of new Japonica rice and aged Baiyuan rice increased slightly, and the price of broken Japonica rice and new Dujian rice remained firm. High-quality kiln-dried rice was stable, while medium-quality was weak. New Yangjian rice continued to rise, and new Chenbu Kejian rice was slightly tight.</p>
<h3 id="e292">Foreign Ke Xian Sales Turn Active <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>The foreign Ke Xian rice market had only inland demand on the weekend, with no movement in the local market, so all rice saw sudden drops. Yesterday, inland areas actively bought Ke Xian and Ke Cao rice. In addition to slightly buying Ke Xian in the local market, there was an even stronger appetite for foreign rice, so morale and the market were both on the rise. The price for the day increased by one jiao or one and a half jiao, exceeding the previous day's decline. The total amount of Xiang rice opened was 3,286 bags, Hankou rice 2,285 bags, Shashi Cao rice 2,000 bags, Zhangzhou rice 100 bags, Guangzhou rice 320 bags. Xiang new machine oil rice, Hankou high Cao rice, and Zhangzhou rice were all recently loaded and were not available in large quantities. Both inland and local areas were greedy for them. The situation is still trending upward.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market had been weak for several days, and trading was even more sluggish. Yesterday, the local market suddenly became active, and the market turned stable. One firm, Xize, sold 2,000 bags, with the price nearly one jiao higher than last week. 200 tons of October futures were also sold at 4.8 yuan, and 1,000 tons of March futures were sold at 5.12 yuan. The October futures were returned goods, with a price of slightly less than five fen. In addition, 500 bags of broken tip rice and glutinous rice were all taken by the local market.</p>

<p>Chongming new sand red beans have been launched for the third batch. The first two batches only had three or four bags, and the price had opened at 5.5 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 17 bags arrived in the market, with the price opening at 6 yuan, half a yuan higher than the previous market. This year's Chongming red bean harvest is poor, with only 10-20% of the usual yield. The beans are also small and thin, but the quality and color are still good. The sales of sand yellow are not active, with only 100 bags traded, so the market price continued to fall, about one-fifth of a jiao lower than last week. Pudong Du beans are also selling slowly, and the market is falling. Other new beans feel even more lifeless.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw cautious, small-scale sales based on actual sales. The trend remained weak. The guild's price for 24 coarse sand white spot goods was 18.8 yuan, and the price for goods from this warehouse was 18.9 yuan, but neither transaction was made. The price for re-exported goods was 5.6 yuan, a jiao lower than the previous day. The price for 89 Dutch red was 14.2 yuan, also five fen lower. The price for re-exported goods was 5.2 yuan, but no transaction was made. There were only quotations, but no transactions for Taikoo Sugar B. The price for Benchang refined white Zhenji No. 1 was 17.4 yuan, and the price for Woji No. 2 was 3 jiao, but there were also no buyers. The future trend looks loose. Guangzhou help firms opened more than one hundred pieces of Nanning basket-shaped green sheets at a price of 10 yuan, and the price was tight. Chao Feng firm opened more than two hundred bags of all-oil package bottom-grade refined red cotton at a price of 12 yuan, and Chaoqing opened more than two hundred and tens of bags, ordinary Huanggang green at 2.1 yuan, and oil packages at 12 yuan. Longgang Qing opened at 11.8 yuan. Two hundred bags of newly arrived Hong Kong original Lai Lai brand top lion ball ice flower Qing arrived, and samples have been seen. The color is yellow, bright, delicate, the quality is dry, and it can be called high-grade, with a price of 15.2 yuan, but no transaction has been made yet.</p>

<p>Hunan lotus seeds suddenly increased by one yuan yesterday according to Hankou telegrams. The price for Hengzhou lotus seeds was 31.6 yuan. With all external expenses added, it was close to 35 yuan, but based on the current market situation in Shanghai, it would sell at most for 32 yuan. The price difference is widening, and the situation is becoming more precarious.</p>
<p>Wood ear has repeatedly increased according to Hankou telegrams. Yesterday's telegram increased by another one yuan, to 84.6 yuan. With external expenses added, it would be nearly 100 yuan in Shanghai, so various firms in Shanghai have no intention of purchasing. The local price has also increased, with Sichuan wood ear now selling for 98 yuan, three yuan higher than before. The price for air-shipped small packages of wood ear is 98 yuan, and the price for high miscellaneous wood ear is 93-94 yuan, but buyers are not willing to accept large quantities for a while.</p>

<p>Old Oil Abundant, New Oil Difficult to Sell</p>
<p>New asphalt production is approaching, and inventory everywhere is still sufficient. Sales venues are similar to when orders fell, and the market's sluggishness is undeniable. The price for heavy Jing oil in the Hankou market is still only 13.6-7 yuan per dan, and the price for flat Jing oil is around 13 yuan. According to news from the Jingzhi area, the current year's yield is similar to last year, but each production area has a thicker inventory of old oil than last year. This is because soap consumption has disappeared, and there is no such large outlet for candle production, so new production is approaching while there is still a lot of old stock, making it impossible to sell. It is understood that in Jinhua and Lanxi, Zhejiang, the asphalt trees are showing a harvest, and the sap is similar to last year. Although there is no official market yet, it is expected that the purchase price will be cheap. The reason is that there is an abundance of old oil, and new oil cannot be expected to sell well. However, in Jiaxing and other places in western Zhejiang, there has been a drought, resulting in a large reduction in the yield, estimated at only 40-50% of the usual yield. Although the market situation is not good, there is no dare to sell the new goods in advance. Because the perspective of a corner, it seems that there is no hope of being cheap, so the new goods transactions, have not yet any news.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the recent foreign exchange contraction and the close price of overseas telegraph wire silk, the silk factories in Wuxi have begun to sell, as each European company is replenishing the goods in short supply. This month's spot silk transactions were very active. As the end-of-month delivery is approaching, 567 packages of white factory silk such as the Moon Rabbit, Double, Three Dancing, and other brands have been shipped to Shanghai in batches in the most recent week waiting for delivery.</p>

<p>Since the sales of Lvzhuang high-grade tea started last week, the situation has already improved. Although trading was slightly slower in the past few days due to slightly higher exchange rates, many telegrams were still issued by various foreign firms. Yesterday, British firms Xiehe, Yihuo, Tianxiang, Jinlong, and others received overseas telegrams requesting goods from Tunxi and Wuyuan, and started actively searching for them. The total city trading volume was more than 1,200 boxes. The price for top-grade tea that has a core was 130 yuan, and the price for average tea was 92 yuan, with little increase or decrease compared to last week. There were also scattered transactions for needles and Gongxi and other kinds of green tea, as well as red tea from Hubei and Hunan, and the market was slightly active.</p>

<p>A Tragedy, Our Soybeans</p>

<p>東三省的特產，首屆一指的要算是大豆了。</p>
<p>The specialty of the Three Eastern Provinces, the most prominent, would have to be soybeans.</p>
<p>隨著東北被佔，大豆也淪入日本帝國主義產業部門之內。這也算不了什麼，十地，人民已都屬了人家，自然無法收回這類特產。</p>
<p>With the Northeast occupied, soybeans also fell into the industrial sector of Japanese imperialism. This isn't a big deal. The land and the people belong to someone else, so naturally there's no way to recover these kinds of specialties.</p>
<p>不過，近日報載日德締結秘密恊定，而這恊定的內容，據哈瓦斯社倫敦電訊，說是由日本每年供給德國一百萬噸大豆，用以交換德國的化學品，炸藥，機關槍，飛機等項殺人武器。這實在是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>However, recently it was reported that Japan and Germany had concluded a secret agreement. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, the content of this agreement is that Japan will supply Germany with one million tons of soybeans annually, in exchange for German chemicals, explosives, machine guns, airplanes, and other weapons of murder. This is really something that we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>日本和德國這項恊定，不論這通電訊的播發，是出於德國的對頭冤家法國的通訊社，也許這是別有作用，但我們可以拋除這一點不談，單談恊定的成立，我們認爲確有可能。何況，如果用我們一句舊話無風不起浪來說，這電訊總還有幾分是可靠的。</p>
<p>Regarding this agreement between Japan and Germany, regardless of whether this telegram was broadcast by the French news agency, Germany's nemesis, and perhaps this has another purpose, we can put this aside and just talk about the establishment of the agreement. We believe that it is entirely possible. Besides, if we use an old saying, "no wind, no waves," then this telegram must have some reliability.</p>
<p>關於恊定完成後的重要性，筆者不願多說，讓我們的國際政治專家去寫些評論罷，筆者在這里要說的話，是爲我們的特產喊一聲冤。</p>
<p>Regarding the importance of the completion of the agreement, I don't want to say too much. Let our international political experts write some comments. What I want to say here is to cry out a wrong for our special product.</p>
<p>如其我們的東北不失掉，我們不是也可以用大豆和德國（或是別國）換些武器麼？固然，我們不贊成殺人，要反對戰爭的，但是最低限度總可以用到自衛上。請問日本從什麼地方得來的大豆，是他國里的特產品？不是的，就是用了我們東北民衆血汁耕種出來的大豆！這是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>If our Northeast hadn't been lost, couldn't we also use soybeans to exchange for weapons with Germany (or another country)? Of course, we don't approve of murder and want to oppose war, but at the very least, we can use them for self-defense. May I ask, where did Japan get the soybeans? Are they a specialty of his country? No, they are the soybeans cultivated with the blood and sweat of our Northeastern people! There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>還記得近兩年來，東北農產品的狂跌，跌得銷路全無。一般農民只有把產品存在家里藏著。大豆是東北農產品中主要部門，農民受害更甚。我們試問這是受到什麼影響？就是受了日本帝國主義有計劃的迫害。現在，我們可以替東北農民道一聲喜，爲的存藏每家的大豆可以賣出，但是日本帝國主義在這種情形下的低價收買，當真發了一筆大財。</p>
<p>Remember the sharp drop in agricultural products in the Northeast over the past two years, so sharp that there were no sales at all. Ordinary farmers could only store the products at home. Soybeans are a major sector of agricultural products in the Northeast, and farmers suffered even more. May we ask, what was the impact? It was the planned persecution by Japanese imperialism. Now, we can congratulate the farmers in the Northeast because the soybeans stored in each household can be sold, but Japanese imperialism really made a fortune by buying them at low prices in this situation.</p>
<p>說來說去吃虧的總是我們自已。人家用我們的東西，換得來武器，將來還要來殺戮我們，這是多麼說不出口的事情！</p>
<p>In the end, we are always the ones who suffer. People use our things to exchange for weapons, and they will come to kill us in the future. How unspeakable this is!</p>
<p>所以，筆者因此要們的大豆喊一聲冤：冤哉，我們的大豆。</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to cry out a wrong for our soybeans: a tragedy, our soybeans.</p>

<p>Reminiscence</p>
<p>— 蕙人</p>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>在你感到身處寂寞或無聊的當兒，例如在秋風蕭瑟，淫雨紛飛，或者秋夜望著明月，聽著秋蟲悲鳴，獨自烯著枝捲煙，靜坐在室內清閑的時候，有意識的或無意識的會翻出些藏在深處的回憶。</p>
<p>When you feel lonely or bored, such as when the autumn wind is bleak, the rain is incessant, or on an autumn night, looking at the bright moon, listening to the mournful chirping of autumn insects, smoking a cigarette alone, sitting quietly indoors in leisure, you will consciously or unconsciously recall some memories hidden deep within.</p>
<p>不論是歡樂的或悲哀的，總會刺激著頭腦，使你感覺到這一回憶的來到，是多少的帶來了一些苦悶：像趙景深先生在人間世第九期上也用著傷威的筆調這樣地寫著：不可復回的過去呵，我寂寞，我要燒掉我的書和我的書桌，我要擲去我的筆……</p>
<p>Whether joyful or sad, they always stimulate the mind, making you feel that the arrival of this memory brings some depression: like Mr. Zhao Jingshen writing in the ninth issue of Renjian Shi with a mournful tone: "Irrecoverable past, I am lonely, I want to burn my books and my desk, I want to throw away my pen…"</p>
<p>所謂苦悶之嘆者，在文人的眼里具體點說就是牢騷。</p>
<p>The so-called sigh of depression, in the eyes of the literati, is specifically grumbling.</p>
<p>在這牢騷中所勾引出來的，雖有著使人不堪回首的印象，或者平淡得簡直沒有回憶之價值，但這沒有價值的回憶到了現在卻也有其特殊的風味，像每一個事實的過去在自已生命史上，佔了值得光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>Although what is evoked in this grumbling has an impression that makes people unbearable to look back on, or it is so plain that it has no value of memory, this valueless memory now has its own special flavor, like every fact of the past occupies a glorious page in one's own life history.</p>
<p>就以一個人來說，在青年時，感覺到兒童時代的生活比現在要好得許多—但是或許在兒童時代也並未感覺到有什麼滿足的地方—但這些早已在腦間消失，所意識到的全是些兒童時的天真可愛，於是在青年時代，天真的搜索便成了一個回憶的題材：假使在老年時代，那麼青年時代又成爲了回憶了對象：假使至將要入木時，那麼連老年時候的一刻靜穆生活也覺得有留戀。</p>
<p>Taking a person as an example, in youth, one feels that childhood life was much better than now—but perhaps in childhood one did not feel anything satisfying—but these have long disappeared from the mind, and what is realized are all the innocence and loveliness of childhood. Thus, in youth, the search for innocence becomes a theme of reminiscence: if in old age, then youth becomes the object of reminiscence: if one is about to die, then even a moment of quiet life in old age feels nostalgic.</p>
<p>因爲身子一靜下來的時候，腦子就回到回溯里，所以對於自已所處身的現在很少機會去體騐它：但奇怪的，就是不去注意的現在會在將來又成爲值得去思戀的一段。</p>
<p>Because when the body calms down, the mind returns to retrospection, so there is little opportunity to experience the present in which one finds oneself: but strangely, the present that is not paid attention to will become a period worthy of nostalgia in the future.</p>
<p>對於現實的不滿，是由於過去回憶奪所呈現出來的而對照著來的，但到底是怎樣的不滿，卻沒有加以具體的體騐，祗不過感覺到過去是有點可愛，而現在是苦悶，痛苦的，不問從前是怎樣的可愛，現在又是怎樣的痛苦。</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with reality comes from the contrast presented by past memories, but what kind of dissatisfaction it is, has not been concretely experienced, only that the past is somewhat lovely, and the present is depressed, painful, without asking how lovely the past was, and how painful the present is.</p>
<p>所以有人說：人是盲目的愛著，盲目的恨著。但是盲目的愛恨民消費了不少的時間。</p>
<p>Therefore, some people say: people love blindly, and hate blindly. But blind love and hate consume a lot of time.</p>
<h3 id="e303">週年 <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>Anniversary</p>
<p>— 夢瀾</p>
<p>— Meng Lan</p>
<p>媽臨終時的那種痛苦掙扎的情狀，還透新鮮的印在我腦膜上，像昨天的事似的，不，像上一個鐘頭里的事似的。</p>
<p>The scene of Mom's painful struggle at the time of her death is still freshly imprinted on my mind, like it was yesterday, no, like it was an hour ago.</p>
<p>可是，現在是整整的一年啦。</p>
<p>But, now it's been a whole year.</p>
<p>一年啦，那太快的光陰呵！</p>
<p>A year, such a quick passage of time!</p>
<p>媽在生前，我對她是沒有好感的，直到臨終一面擬著電報告訴姊姊的時候，還是像替別人家寫便條擬的，滑有一些感想，更沒有所謂悲哀。</p>
<p>When Mom was alive, I didn't have good feelings towards her, until I was drafting the telegram to tell my sister at the time of her death, it was still like drafting a memo for someone else, with only a few slippery thoughts, and even less so-called sorrow.</p>
<p>那沒有好感的理由，大概是因爲母親過度的愛護，以致變成了過度的嘮叨，於是在任性的倔強的孩子的心中，便成爲討厭了。</p>
<p>The reason for not having good feelings was probably because my mother's excessive love turned into excessive nagging, and in the heart of a willful, stubborn child, it became annoying.</p>
<p>譬如少穿了一件衣服，便會說上一個鐘頭，而我是會把善意視作敵意的，以爲這麼大了，還老是嚕蘇著吃穿。</p>
<p>For example, if I wore one less piece of clothing, she would talk about it for an hour, and I would see kindness as hostility, thinking that I'm so old, and she's still always nagging about what to eat and wear.</p>
<p>次數一多，便不問理由的聽見母親嘮叨，便一溜煙的走開。</p>
<p>After it happened so many times, I wouldn't even ask the reason and just take off in a puff of smoke when I heard my mother nagging.</p>
<p>這樣，是重重的傷了慈母的心。</p>
<p>In this way, I severely hurt my loving mother's heart.</p>
<p>此外，便是新舊思想的衡突，而我又是不懂小節的：在舊一代的人以爲應該盡禮的地方，我往往一笑視之。</p>
<p>In addition, there was the conflict between new and old ideas, and I didn't understand the minor details: in places where the older generation thought I should pay my respects, I often laughed it off.</p>
<p>記得有一次，—那是母親抱恨終身的一次呵，我深深的紀錄，—從鄉間回來，回爲舟車上過度的勞頓，到家又天還不曾亮，於是便沒有母親房里去請安，便回到自已房里睡了，可是，這自已不經意的過失，在媽的心目中，是以爲掉了娘了，使她整整不樂了好幾天，直到病重的時候，還不時的把這件事提起。</p>
<p>I remember one time—it was the one that Mother regretted for the rest of her life, I deeply record it—coming back from the countryside, because of the excessive fatigue from the boat and car, and it wasn't even dawn when I got home, so I didn't go to my mother's room to pay my respects, but went back to my own room to sleep. But, this unintentional mistake of mine, in Mom's eyes, was like she lost her daughter, making her unhappy for several days, until she was seriously ill, she would still bring up this matter from time to time.</p>
<p>當時，倔強的任性的我以爲媽不該這樣的求全責備，心里也感到幾分不快，可是，又誰料這小小的事件居然使媽抱恨終身的呢？</p>
<p>At the time, the stubborn and willful me thought that Mom shouldn't be so demanding, and I felt a bit unhappy in my heart, but who would have thought that this small incident would actually make Mom regret it for the rest of her life?</p>
<p>到現在，還有誰肯嘮叨的地牽住了手問冷問暖？</p>
<p>Now, who is willing to nag and hold my hand, asking if I'm cold or warm?</p>
<p>還有誰怪我祗吃了一碗飯便放下了筷呢？</p>
<p>Who else blames me for putting down my chopsticks after eating only one bowl of rice?</p>
<p>人家的悲哀是會眼著時日消失去了的，而我，跟了時日的增長，增長了我的悲思。</p>
<p>Other people's sorrows will disappear with the passage of time, but for me, with the growth of time, my sadness grows.</p>
<p>媽在時，家庭里是有種說不出的融洽的樂趣的，而現在，媽死了剛一年，家庭的融洽的空氣在那里？</p>
<p>When Mom was alive, there was an unspeakable harmonious joy in the family, but now, Mom has been dead for just a year, where is the harmonious atmosphere of the family?</p>
<p>這倔強的任性的孩子，又爲了忍不住種種刺激，做了家庭的叛徒，到社會來困苦地和社會搏門了，媽，要是你在世的話，你肯允許你的孩子過著這樣艱難的生活嗎？</p>
<p>This stubborn and willful child, unable to resist the various stimuli, has become a traitor to the family, and has come to society to struggle painfully with society, Mom, if you were alive, would you allow your child to live such a difficult life?</p>
<p>媽，要是你有靈的話，在這週年祭里，你看一看現在家庭里的景象，你一家要放心痛哭的呢？</p>
<p>Mom, if you have a soul, in this anniversary, if you look at the current scene in the family, your whole family must cry with pain, right?</p>
<p>可是，現在是，再見不到媽清瘦的臉上流著凄苦的淚了。</p>
<p>But, now, I can no longer</p>
<h3 id="e304">Minor Ailment in Late Autumn <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— A'er</p>
<p>Some literati say: three parts illness, seven parts leisure, a minor ailment has its own unique charm. However, as for me? Whenever I feel unwell, I always feel extremely troubled. I can neither write articles nor do other work. I am just restless all day and night. So I am a bit doubtful about these experienced talks of the literati. However, who has the leisure to care about these things amidst the anxieties of life? But I finally collapsed and got what is called sick. I was already worried when I wasn't sick, so what now that I'm sick? What am I going to do? It was already difficult to cope when I wasn't sick, if I really get sick, then there's even less I can do. I fully experienced the autumn wind blowing and catching a cold! I developed a slight fever and chills. I fell onto the bed in a daze. At this time, in the cold and quiet garret room, besides my own moans, I couldn't hear any other sound. Not only was there not seven parts leisure, but there was twelve hundred thousand parts distress. The pain of the illness itself could be tolerated. However, who is going to struggle and bear the burden of life? Don't say that when you are sick you can't get up and find food to eat, and you can't even eat, and that someone and money are needed to serve you, to make milk and get water for you to drink. Just the oppression of life is enough to make the illness worse. Even if it gradually gets better without medical treatment, there are still no seven parts leisure, only increased worries in my heart! How to deal with rent, food expenses, and a weak body? The three parts illness are gone, so my mood should be better! In fact, it's getting worse and worse, and I'm even more worried about food, clothing, and shelter! I force myself to write articles, hoping to exchange some manuscript fees for relief, which can temporarily replace the seven parts leisure! However, my hands are weak and my head is dizzy and unclear. If I think about it, my head hurts even more, so I can only secretly wonder what to do? And fall back on the bed. The bed no longer brings any leisure. Even though I try my best to avoid distress. So-called good rest, don't think too much. But how can this be avoided? This requires certain conditions to be able to rest and avoid it. Otherwise, you need to have the ability to not need food, clothing, and shelter. Or have some savings of your own. Therefore, the so-called three parts illness, seven parts leisure is not something that ordinary people can achieve!</p>

<p>Amidst the talk of economic downturn, shops are adopting the strategy of using huge advertisements to attract customers, which is said to be quite effective. And radio advertisements are even more unexpectedly effective.</p>
<p>A certain shop specializing in selling aviation lottery tickets reported: ... Our shop has repeatedly won huge prizes. The eighth lottery draw is not far away. Please come to our shop. All kinds of numbers are available for you to choose from.</p>
<p>This advertisement can be said to be extremely authentic. It first introduced itself, explaining its winning achievements from the first to the seventh lottery draws. Although there is no case to verify, Shanghai people are accustomed to using their ears instead of their eyes, so advertising effectiveness has naturally occurred. Secondly, it reported that the draw is not far away, which is even more clever. It is like saying that money is flying past your door, hurry up and grab it! You must grab it! Of course, come to our shop. At this point, the advertisement has been successfully completed. According to the reporter's understanding, because business has already been attracted. However, it insisted on saying that the numbers are complete, which seems to be somewhat self-defeating. Imagine, among the 500,000 numbers, if there are no more huge prizes won repeatedly, would there still be gambling friends who listen to your advertisement?</p>
<h3 id="e306">The Violin is Silent <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>The violin is silent! Really, it has been at least a week since I heard this melodious, nostalgic violin sound!</p>
<p>A week ago, when I carried a book and walked to the park every morning, I had to pass through a shallow alley and a winding short path. In a small Western-style house at the end of this lane, there was always a section by section, sound by sound of melodious violin music sent out, rippling in the dim morning light. Although I had to pass there at 5:30, it seemed that the violin sound was even earlier than me. So when I routinely walked near that small Western-style house at the end of the alley every day, I would hear the clanging melody floating out from this small Western-style house, slowly floating out.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I always loved listening to this sound. Therefore, whenever I passed there, I had to linger in front of that small Western-style house for a while before reluctantly leaving. Sometimes the violin music didn't end, and I didn't even want to leave, preferring not to go to the park and not wanting to read a book. Really, this melody was too inviting! So full of resentment and longing, so like weeping and complaining.</p>
<p>Although the small Western-style house was not very large or very high, it was quite exquisite. It was built along the riverbank. One side was the river, and the other side was a garden. The air was extremely good, and the scenery was also excellent. People who live here must be very fortunate. But from whose fingers did that melodious violin sound come from? Was it the male owner? No, judging from the graceful melody, it must be a female owner, maybe a young lady, definitely, definitely.</p>
<p>In order to dispel this curious doubt, I paid attention to which window the melody was coming from every day.</p>
<p>One day, I got up at 5:30 as usual, and also carried a book as usual and walked on the road to the park. When I walked to the front of that small Western-style house, the melodious, sorrowful sound waves were rippling around again, and there was also a nightingale-like singing voice, which was clearly a young lady's singing voice. So I leaned on the iron railing by the riverbank and looked up, looked up, and the miracle that had been pressing on my heart for a long time was finally discovered by me: the beautiful young lady's shadow had already been captured in my eyes.</p>
<p>Isn't it so? That was a young lady, a beautiful young lady. I thought in surprise like this.</p>
<p>She was wearing a honey-colored thin silk morning gown, with soft, white feathers attached to the collar and cuffs. The slightly curled hair moved slightly. The golden sunlight shone on her face, making her even more charming. Whose young lady is this! I couldn't help but stare at her foolishly.</p>
<p>From then on, a corner of my empty mind was filled with this innocent and lively young lady's jade figure. So every morning, more important than any homework, I had to admire her beautiful appearance once and listen to the violin sound.</p>
<p>For several months like this, I had never been disappointed once. However, there were also two times that disappointed me. One time was three days, and the other time was one day. It turned out that she went to Hangzhou for three days, and she had a headache for one day, so she didn't come to play. But I blessed her, at all times.</p>
<p>But things were too unfortunate! She finally died of diphtheria in the xx hospital this autumn - that is, a week ago! From then on, where is the beauty, the violin sound will never be heard again!</p>
<p>The owner of the violin is dead! The violin is silent! Now, when I walk here every day, I always shout like that in a low voice, but it finally makes me feel as if I have lost a heart, and I am now offering my deepest condolences to her spirit!</p>

<p>Opening (Unexpected Fate)</p>
<p>Honest young man Lu Yiqun. He was lonely and miserable since he was young and orphaned. Fortunately, his parents raised him with the skills to teach the orphan. The mother and son spent their time bitterly in Jinling. Who knew that a letter came from the sea seeking a place. The wagtail borrowed a branch of spring. Lu Sheng heard the news and hurriedly packed his bags to go. He worked very hard in Shanghai. One day, the weather was beautiful and the wind was gentle. Yiqun was strolling along the Bund after work. Who would have expected a free car to rush by. Sitting on it was a peerless beauty with misty temples. The woman accidentally knocked Yiqun down. So she got out of the car and comforted him with sincere intentions. The next day, the postman from Yuan Yi arrived. Fanfo issued fifty zun. Lu Sheng was flattered and frightened. He thought that he had never loved gold in his life. His heart was twisted and suspected. He had to personally visit Zhu's house with the money. By the way, he asked about the relatives of Duojiao Bangqin. He knew that Ruolan was her fragrant name. The two were chatting by the gauze window. Suddenly, they heard Miss Zhu's throat cough. They saw the white-haired Zhu Weng slowly enter. It turned out that he had already become a treasure in the coral net. It was only because Zhu Weng wanted to find a dragon ride. When he saw the factory secretary, his eyes fell in love. It was only because he didn't know what his heart was like. So he set up a plan to test the scholar again and again. As the saying goes, true gold is not afraid of fierce fire. Sure enough, the delicate guest was young but experienced. A true marriage is an unexpected connection. Lovers form Zhu Chen. That free car should be a great benefactor.</p>

<h3 id="e312">A Glimpse of Architectural Investment in the Shanghai Concessions in the Past Ten Years <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— Pillow Wood</p>
<p>If we try to tour the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession for a week, we will be shocked and sigh endlessly at the various buildings scattered throughout them. After all, what are the achievements of the buildings in the two concessions? Last week, the Mainland Daily revealed the number of buildings in the British and French concessions in the past ten years, which is listed and translated as follows:</p>
<p>Among them, the amount of construction in 1930 was the highest, with 8,836 buildings built in the Public Concession alone, worth a total of 65 million yuan. This was when the National Army established Nanjing, the situation was peaceful, and there was hope for prosperity. Later, in 1932, due to the January 28th Shanghai War, the construction industry also declined sharply, with the amount of investment only reaching more than 25 million, less than half of that in 1930. However, the French Concession suffered less from the Shanghai War, so the degree of decline was only about one-third. This can be clearly seen from the table above. But how long ago was it, and the total amount of architectural investment in this year has shown a rapid rise and vigorous increase. As of September of this year, the total amount of the Public Concession and the French Concession has reached more than 41 million yuan, which is actually alarming. Let's try to list the total amount of assets and construction categories of the Public Concession last year as follows to observe the trend of construction in this city. The total amount of construction assets in the Public Concession in 1933 was 35,463,740 yuan, with more than 5,130 buildings, including 3,545 ordinary Chinese houses, 257 Western-style houses, 13 apartments, 13 office buildings, 204 shops, 4 theaters, 7 schools, 27 factories, 63 industrial buildings, 20 storage yards, 98 warehouses, and 879 other buildings. The distribution of all buildings in the French Concession and the two districts this year is also roughly similar.</p>
<p>The reason why Shanghai's construction industry can develop so well is that the Shanghai Chinese and foreign banks, trust companies, and insurance companies have absorbed all the national funds from the countryside, which has been increasing day by day. Those who hold this huge amount of money, in view of the instability of public bonds, standard gold, and cloth transactions, have no other way but to invest in real estate construction. Therefore, the development of Shanghai's construction industry is an inevitable trend in the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the畸形development of the city. Moreover, due to the high price of land, there is a natural reason for the increasing height of buildings.</p>

<p>— Chin</p>
<p>No one can deny that architecture can represent the culture of an era because architecture is truly a good history recorded in stone.</p>
<p>Victor Hugo said: In the world before six thousand years, architecture was merely a great chronicle of humanity. From it, not only are there religious symbols, but also the emergence of human thought, all contained within its pages.</p>
<p>Ancient architecture clearly shows us the habits, daily work, and beliefs, difficulties, and fears of people at that time. Because the people of that time could not write and read as we do now, and even in the Middle Ages, very few people could read books, so they had to record their behavior and thoughts on wood and stone, leaving them behind as materials for us to study ancient culture today.</p>
<p>Therefore, the architecture of a country can reflect the thinking and creativity of that country. The various houses we see are not built without a reason; they all represent the degree of cultural progress within an era. Although many of the construction methods are clumsy and some are ingenious, the ultimate meaning is still worth studying.</p>
<p>(A) Architecture on the Banks of the Nile</p>
<p>Four thousand years before the birth of Christ, the people on the banks of the Nile were already very enlightened. They lived in cities and were able to do many exquisite works of art. Therefore, in Egypt, we discovered the birthplace of architecture. The great pyramids there, the single-bodied sphinx, and the many majestic temples and tombs all represent the essence of this mysterious ancient country, while also telling us about the lives and characteristics of the Egyptian people.</p>
<p>In Egypt, there are a total of seventy-five large pyramids. Their size, solidity, and simplicity represent the thoughts and perseverance of the Egyptian people. The largest one has a base of 7,746 feet on each side, and the bricks used to build it must be at least 3.3 million. Such a huge number may be difficult for you to imagine for a while, so let me give you an analogy. If we dismantle these bricks and build a very solid city wall, its length could encircle the entire country of France!</p>
<p>These majestic pyramids are not religious buildings, like pagodas in our Buddhist culture, they are the tombs of ancient Egyptian kings. Because these kings were afraid that after their death, someone would come and damage their bodies, and that many priceless treasures buried with them would be stolen, they built these huge and solid tombs, thinking they were completely safe and could last for thousands of years. Who knew that their bodies would still be returned to nature, not even a bone would be left to this day, and what remains is the pyramid that has endured for more than five thousand years, retaining the glory of their lives for generations to come.</p>
<p>Next are the magnificent ancient temples in Egypt. They also generally display a simple and solid structure, with many exquisite carvings, but in terms of structure, they rely only on thick, straight stone pillars, slabs, and lintels. The inside of the temples is very dark and bizarre. The worshipers must pass through a courtyard with colonnades, and then to a dimly lit hall, where the statue of the Egyptian god is enshrined in the center. They are also almost as dim and mysterious, surrounded by countless spells, incantations, and strange rituals, and will never see the light of day.</p>
<p>A large temple in Karnak, named Ammon, is the most prominent. Its form is very similar to our current cathedrals, but its completion took hundreds of years. From the paintings on the surrounding walls, we can see a difficult process at that time. The temple was started around 2400 BC, and a courtyard surrounded by many great colonnades was added a few hundred years later. In 1350 BC, the majestic main hall was finally built. This is probably an unprecedentedly large building. The volume of the main hall is extremely large, reaching 340 feet in length and about 170 feet in width. Its roof is supported by 134 thick pillars. Its magnificence and beauty are unprecedented.</p>
<p>But such a great building would certainly not have been successful in another era. Because at this time, the system of slavery was prevalent, and the country drove prisoners to do endless hard labor. We can imagine from the upright stone pillars, the scene of tens of millions of people working under the whip, chiseling huge granite blocks with a small chisel. We also seem to hear the cries of those poor animals as they dragged such a heavy stone pillar through five hundred miles of dry desert. Therefore, although Egyptian architecture, in its simple and solid shape, can be called magnificent, it leaves traces of the slave system, containing infinite fear. This fear was, on the one hand, in the king, who feared the insecurity after his death: and on the other hand, in the laborers who feared that the whip would be applied to their own bodies.</p>

<p>Translated from the Auckland Star, April 14th</p>
<p>A large-scale new enterprise is emerging within the province of Auckland. Its future success or failure, though subject to unpredictable factors, is fueled by an ambition sufficient to attract the attention of all parties concerned throughout the territory. The planting, preservation, and marketing of its new forests are gradually catching up with sheep farming and dairy farming as the primary sources of wealth in the fertile lands of New Zealand. The evidence for this is found in the softwoods of Taupo, Putaruru, and the surrounding areas. In recent years, several companies have assisted the National Forestry Department in its afforestation efforts. However, the largest and most prominent in this endeavor is the New Zealand Perpetual Forests Limited. Its operational performance serves as a model. The company is developing desolate lands in Taupo, Rotorua, and other places, reportedly capable of supporting the planting of millions of softwood trees. Since 1925, Perpetual Forests Limited has planted 150,000 acres of forest, totaling 122.5 million trees. This land, previously barren, now encompasses no less than 250 square miles of planted areas. These approximate figures, though subject to variation, are based on accurately compiled official statistics. All who visit the forest agree with this assessment.</p>
<h3 id="e315">Factory Chimney Construction Methods <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Hao</p>
<p>One of the important industrial buildings</p>
<p>Any power plant needs an appropriate amount of air to be introduced into the boiler to assist combustion. The adjustment of this appropriate amount of air must rely on the chimney. Therefore, the importance of the chimney has been recognized by general engineers. At the same time, its height, materials, and all construction methods have been carefully studied by engineers and considerable achievements have been made. The diameter of the chimney cannot exceed 8% of its height. Its height is sometimes determined by the type of coal or other fuel, as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Fuel Chimney Height (feet)</p>
<p>Grass or Wood 35</p>
<p>Bituminous Coal Lumps 100</p>
<p>Ordinary Coal Granules 100</p>
<p>Ordinary Bituminous Coal 115</p>
<p>Small Coal Lumps or Anthracite 125</p>
<p>Anthracite Fine Particles 150</p>
<p>There are many materials for building chimneys, such as brick, tile, cement, steel, etc., which are described as follows:</p>
<p>1. Brick Chimneys – Chimneys built with bricks are generally constructed in two parts, namely the outer ring and the inner ring. Firebricks are often embedded to strengthen them. An air space is usually left in the middle of the outer and inner rings, so that the inner ring can freely expand and contract. Brick chimneys are very expensive to build, and their lifespan is forty to fifty years.</p>
<p>2. Tile Chimneys – Tile chimneys are built with hollow tiles. They do not have a firebrick lining, are very light, and are very inexpensive to build, but they are not as strong as brick ones.</p>
<p>3. Cement Chimneys – The strongest and most expensive chimneys are cement chimneys. They are poured entirely of pure cement, without joints. Light weight and space saving are their characteristics. They are most suitable for large-scale factories. If they are built well, their lifespan can be extended indefinitely, but they are not needed for small-scale factories.</p>
<p>4. Steel Chimneys – Factories with ordinary medium-to-low capital all build relatively inexpensive steel chimneys. They are created by dismantling used boiler plates. They are nailed to very strong supports (using extremely large screws).</p>
<p>These supports must be sufficiently strong to avoid any risk of damage. The inside of this type of steel chimney should be lined with firebricks all the way to the top, so it is very heavy. The outside is often painted to prevent the steel from rusting in the air, because the smoke contains a small amount of acid (usually dilute sulfuric acid), which has a very severe corrosive effect on steel. Therefore, the lifespan of a steel chimney is only twenty to thirty years, which is very suitable for small-capital factories.</p>
<h3 id="e316">On Theater Architecture (Part 1) <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The times are constantly advancing. The art of architecture is also keeping pace with the times. So, undoubtedly, the architecture of theaters is also evolving rapidly. Looking at the city of Shanghai alone, the theaters of a dozen years ago and the most recent theaters, in comparison, differ not only in form but also in architecture. Therefore, if we want to build a theater that is suitable for the times, we should pay attention to both the architecture and the equipment. And because of the different environments and different locations, the same theater that is suitable for building in Location A may not be suitable for building in Location B. What follows are just some common issues in building theaters.</p>
<p>(1) Form The question of form is certainly very important when building a theater. Regardless of the size, a theater, in terms of form, must at least not have any vulgar colors in its splendor. In other words, it must meet the conditions of artistic and modern. When the audience walks to the entrance of the theater, they will immediately develop a sense of beauty for the architecture of the theater. Even people who do not want to go in, will be attracted by the allurement and want to go inside to see the internal style.</p>
<p>(2) Stage In addition to showing films every day, a theater must build a stage below the screen for performances, singing, and dancing. Usually, the stage and the screen are completely at the same focal point. But for the setting of the stage, it should not be too large or too small in form. It should be moderate. It should not be too large or too small. It should be moderate. And, more importantly, the open space on the stage can be fully seen by every audience member in the theater.</p>
<p>(3) Seating Seating is also very important in a theater. The first requirement for seating is spaciousness, so that the audience feels very comfortable sitting inside. The configuration of the seats is closely related to the stage. It is essential that the line of sight from each seat can reach the screen or stage directly. Although some theaters must be crescent-shaped, if the construction is proper, the audience sitting on the side can see the screen or stage completely the same as those in the center, and they do not feel that they are sitting on the side.</p>
<p>(4) Paint The color of the paint applied to the outside of the theater should of course be beautifying, with a magnificent and elegant color in greatness. And in the inside of the theater, the control of various colors should be appropriate. Walls. Ceiling. Pillars. Chairs. Stage. If it is all one color, it seems too monotonous. But if there are too many colors and too bright, it feels vulgar. The distribution should be appropriate. On the ceiling and walls, snow white and scarlet have long become the colors of the past. Now, colors that are generally used are blue, yellow, white, etc. in harmony.</p>
<p>(5) Lighting In the past, when we walked into a theater, we often saw many lights, shining like daylight. In fact, this method is completely wrong. After the lights are too strong, it is easy to damage the audience's eyesight. Especially before the movie starts, the room is brightly lit. After it starts, it is completely dark. A sudden change from light to dark most easily damages people's eyesight. Therefore, newly built theaters now often clip the electric lights in the ceiling or walls, or use reflected light so that the light is not too bright, and will not shine directly into the audience's line of sight.</p>
<p>(6) Entrance The road in front of the entrance to a theater should be wide, and entry and exit should be convenient. If the theater is located with roads on two or more sides, then it is best to have two or more entrances. This makes entry and exit and ticket purchases very convenient. When one group finishes and another group starts, the audience of the two groups will not feel crowded when they are entering and exiting at the same time. And with two or more ticket sales points, the audience will avoid crowding when buying tickets.</p>
