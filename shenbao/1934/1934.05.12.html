<p>雖然。國聯與其會員國進行技術合作。乃國聯之責任。中國興國聯進行技術合作。乃中國之權利。此爲純粹關於國聯與其會員國間事。絕不容第三者置喙。何待申説。矧國聯與其會員國間之技術合作。先例甚多。不始自中國。中國與國聯之技術合作。早在民國十八年初。亦不始自今日。日本不反對其他與國聯合作之國家。又不反對於身充國聯行政院會員之時而獨反對於表示退出國聯之後。其爲非善意的政治干涉爲。彰彰明甚。吾人認爲日人此舉之目的。於其謂在消極的威脅中國。停止與國聯合作母寗謂在積極的激制中國。强其急進。然後據爲進一步宰割之藉口。或在挾制中國與彼單獨往來。以圖實現其所標榜之東亞門羅主義。是以吾人縱因不堪日人之壓迫而停止與國聯合作。仍不足以稍戢其侵略之心。可以斷言今拉氏之報告書旣發表矣。去其實行之期亦更近一步矣。衝情度勢。萬無半途而廢之理。然吾人固不必因日人之片面反對而喪氣。亦不能不愼重攷慮前途之困難。吾人以爲今後之國聯技術合作。能否不生意外。其關鍵所在不外二端卽（一）爲預防日方之從旁破壞。（二）爲避免列强政治經濟勢力之侵入而此二端又端又與投資問題發生密切之關係。邇來日人以整理舊債爲要挾。反對國聯對華合作。其着眼點尤在於歐美財政之援助。過去國聯技術合作之内容旣限於專家之延聘。與中外技術機關之聯絡。而不涉投資範圍。吾人仍當善體斯意就各專家樂經恊力造成關於今後經濟建設之環境與基礎儘行狮用本國資本。卽至不能不需要外資時。亦當本嚴格規定之條件。然後加以利用。卽如拉西曼報告書中所戴棉業絲業之統制化。與興水利造公路之種種條陳。皆含有國際投資嚴重競爭之成分。實行之際。自應愼之又愼須知技術合作乃國聯與其會員國間之關係。而實行合作計劃之投資。乃債權與債務之關係。决不可混爲一談也。</p>
<p>至若各外籍專家。祗以個人資格供我方之顧問諮詢吾人不當視之爲其所屬國代表。各人任務。旣曾明白規定。以關於某種或某組工作爲限。亦不可任其越權活動。誠能如是。差可减殺日人之藉口。與夫列强勢力入侵之危機焉。</p>
<h3>日本反對技術合作　我方暫無表示</h3>
<p>（南京）外息、日方對技術合作、於四月十七日非正式聲明後、爲國際所痛駁、日方亦知引起反感、旋又加遁詞、拉西曼報告書發表後、日方之宣傳更烈、甚謂凖備向國際抗議、吾國方面現時對於日方此種態度靜觀形勢、暫不表示、如日方有正式文件宣布時、當再加以駁斥、（十一日專電）</p>

<p>今敝國政府所有初步調查工作業已辦理、現在决定依據財力所及、先就若干省份開始　施經濟建設工作、以爲起點、而資全國其餘各區域之模範、</p>
<p>此項經濟建設工作、必須預其事者皆繼續努力、並須將所有應辦事業配置適宜、方克奏功、自無待言、貴院在現時狀况之下、所取方法、凡足使貴聯合會與敝國政府關於經濟建設之合作可以繼續進行者、均爲敝國政府所深願、而推舉技術人員一人、派　敝國、爲貴聯合會與敝國政府及全國經濟委員會之技術合作代表一節尤所盼企、</p>
<p>上述各節、倘　荷從速提出討論、俾凡所議决、得早日實行、是所至盼、</p>
<p>二、國聯行政院於一九三三年六月三十日開會時决議指定國際聯合會中國技術合作委員會、審核中國政府上項照會應由國聯如何辦理、此委員會遂於一九三三年七月十八日在巴黎召集會議、其决議於同日經國聯行政院核准、内容如下、</p>
<p>國聯行政院應依照中國政府之請求、委派技術合作代表一人其任務純　技術性質、絕不涉及政治、循此原則、技術合作代表卽爲國聯與全國經濟委員會之技術連絡員、辦理中國與國聯各該管機關技術上之合作事務、</p>
<p>技術合作代表之任期應爲一年、其薪水旅費及生活費用、由中國政府供給之、</p>
<p>技術合作代表之聯務如左、</p>
<p>（一）供給中國關於國聯各技術機關工作情形之報告、並爲使中國經濟建設事業得與國際合作起見、貢獻中國政府如何可以利用各該機</p>

<p>技術合作代表、不論何時、如向國聯遞呈記事錄或工作報告同時應將副本呈送全國經濟委員會、</p>
<p>國際聯合會中國技術合作委員會任命秘書處衛生組組長拉西曼爲國聯駐華技術合作代表、其職務規定已如上述、</p>
<p>國際聯合會中國技術合作委員會將决議知照行政院時、聲明本委員會自後仍願繼續聽行政院之指揮、以便（一）考慮中國政府對於經濟建設事業向國聯行政院提出之技術合作問題、（二）審查技術合作代表之陳報及報告、曁討論或審核關於該代表履行職務之一切問題、</p>
<p>三、余遵奉國聯行政院之訓令、依照與中國政府商定之辦法、於一九三三年十月三日到華任職、</p>
<p>四、一九三三年九月廿三日、中國國民政府公布修正全國經濟委員會組織條例、特派行政院汪院長精衛、立法院孫院長科、財政部宋部長子文、爲全國經濟委員會委員、並均指定爲常務委員、十月四日、汪孫宋三常務委員就職、</p>
<p>五、旣而宋部長子文　財政部長之職、一面全國經濟委員會常務委員名額又由三人擴充至五人、中國國民政府乃加派新任財政部孔部長祥熙、及軍事委員會蔣委員長中正、爲常務委員、孔蔣兩常務委員於十二月廿日、廿七日、先後就職、</p>
<p>六、各常務委員陸續就職之後、遂將一九三四年度應行舉辦或應補助經費之各項事業、詳密討論、而對於正在繼續辦理之各項經濟建設工作、亦加以審核、</p>
<p>七、全國經濟委員會於初步研究告畢後、當將與國聯技術合作之程序提出與余討論、此項程序、余已於一九三三年十二月三十日送致國聯秘書長、</p>
<p>余於一九三三年十二月三十日送致國聯秘嘗長之函中、在説明全國經濟委員會之提議大旨以前、曾向秘書長建議、凡遴派專家赴華服務、其人數務以少爲宜、而此項專家之遴選、又以曾經服務於數國、對工作上富有經騐者爲主、否則亦應準備在華匃留稍久、俾能熟諳當地情形、同時余又曾聲明、國聯衛生、交通運輸、及經濟各機關與中國政府之合作業已展期至一九三四年、而去華之政制顧問一人亦正在繼續從事研究也、</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會所擬一九三四年份之主要事業、爲交通之改良、水利之修治、及在若干區域施行廣大之農村建設、</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會以爲公路建築已達相當程度、須有曾在舉中國情形相似之國家服務、而富有經騐之工程師、與之研討、俾得改進、至所須研討之問題、以左例四端爲要、</p>
<p>（一）在指定區域内之公路、應採用何種路面最發適宜、</p>
<p>（二）運用公路之方法、</p>
<p>（三）當地可以供給之燃料、</p>
<p>（四）最適宜之車輛及發動機式樣、</p>
<p>因此、曾請國聯運輸交通組延聘專家赴華、以備諮詢、至關於水利問題、亦請延致富有國際經騐之工程師一員、以備中國關於　施水利政策之顧問、</p>
<p>余曾建議、此次派遣專家、備充顧問人數以三人爲限、各專家並須才識卓越、偕同國聯運輸交通組長官赴華、</p>
<p>敎育部曾淸國聯派遣敎育專家赴華、討論二年前國際文化合作會派赴中國之國際敎育考察團、及一九三二年中國赴　敎育考察團、所提各項建議應如何實施、該部並希望國聯遴選之人員、可以充任中國與國聯文化合作會間之常任駐歡連絡員、該連絡員之職務應爲：</p>
<p>（一）爲赴歐考察之敎育家預事凖備各項專門研究資料、</p>
<p>（二）依照中國政府之請求、物色專家、以備中國關於改革特種敎育事宜之顧問、</p>
<p>（三）指導中國留學生之學業、</p>
<p>當時國聯行政院建議、擬卽遴選一人、以富有經騐、能以敎育政策配合於普遍廣大之實業建設政策者充任之、</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會對於特賴貢尼敎授在華時之農業調查、甚爲重視、並盼望其早日重來倘特賴貢尼敎授不能應聘去華、則請國聯羅致對於戰後歐洲各農業國家實行土地改革富有經騐之專家、以備就中選擇學識卓越者代之、而於</p>
<p>歐美及蘇俄經濟委員會之工作及方法富有經騐者、尤宜羅致數人、</p>
<p>此外、又曾詢及巴利加敎授能否在北平地質調查所擔任工作、查巴氏前由國聯指派、曾在南京中央大學任職兩年者也</p>
<p>瑪利博士自一九三二年以來、經國聯經濟委員會應中國政府之請求、委任爲中國改良蠶業專家、該氏自一九三四年一月一日起、被聘爲全國經濟委員會之專員、中國政府擬更請國聯舉薦具有法國蠶業經騐之專家一人、以充任同類之職務、此兩蠶業專家薪水之一部分由國聯負擔之、</p>
<p>八、當一九三四年一月十日、國聯行政院中國技術合作委員會開會之時、因關於技術合作之實施計畫仍在考慮、余曾請國聯行政院之准許、容俟日後再遞詳細報告、遂於同月四日先呈一發凡短文、陳述進行經過、内稱：</p>
<p>查國聯行政院促進國聯與中國技術合作之議案深得中國政府領袖贊同中國各重要團體對之亦多認爲滿意、全國經濟委員會常務委員現　行政院院長軍事委員會委員長財政部部長、立法院院長、以及重要政治家宋　文氏、各機關咸樂與合作預料其結果必佳該會事業費將由美國棉麥借欵項　撥充辦法盼不久可以决定、其建設新計畫、正在通盤研究、關於公路、水利、農村建設、敎育及公共衛生等原有建設工作、仍在繼續進行其一九三四年、上項工作與國聯之合作計畫、前已連同意見送秘書長備交各技術組研究、詳細報告請准緩送、待中外各專家從事經濟調查、得有結論、中國政府確定具體計畫後、當再詳細陳報、此後關於各項工作、自當仍循舊例、分報各技術組、并將進行狀况按期陳報秘書長核奪</p>
<p>九、全國經濟委員會現仍繼續辦理衛生、築路及水利工程、至新定之工作、亦正由中外職員及專家按照程序分别實地調查詳爲研究計畫郭樂遜及司丹巴二氏、於此項調查研究等工作、分别參與、俱下文、</p>
<p>十、全國經濟委員會一九三四年之事業進行計畫、經該會常務委員會議核定、復於本年三月廿六日、經該會全體委員會議之通過、</p>
<p>十一、對於現在續辦各部分事業及一九三四年度擬辦各項事業、應如何得國聯各技術機關之合作各節、余與國聯行政院中國技術合作委員會秘書迭次書牘往還、多所論及、此項書牘、所關非細也、</p>
<h3>第一章　全國經濟委員會之歷史</h3>
<p>一、一九三一年五月、中國國民政府决定設立全國經濟委員會其時適當國内大亂敉平、華中華北西南東北各省、咸秉中央政令、而世界經濟危機中國固尙未受其影響、是以和平發展、頗多希望、中國政府切盼國聯與中國之技術合作能早日實行、當國際文化合作會派遣去華之考察國尙在途中、其他技術人員、亦將東行之際、不意長江流域、（註一）忽遭空前未有之水災於是國聯遂依照中國政府之請求、指派國聯最有經騐之專家、赴華担任國民政府救濟水災委員會副委員長之職（註二）</p>
<p>一九三一年秋、西方工業領袖諸國之經濟危機、益見迫切、如英國放棄金本位、卽彰明較著之表示也、</p>
<p>是年九月十八日、日軍侵佔瀋陽、於是中國政府、正在辦理之長江流域急賑工作及正在組織尙待成立之中央發展經濟機關均遭頓挫、</p>
<p>一、然在此内憂外患交迫之中、全國經濟委員會、仍能於是年十一月十五日舉行第一次全體會議、該會委員長國民政府主席蔣中正開會時致詞詳述設置該會之目的、略謂：</p>
<p>（註一）參考國民政府救濟水災委員會報告</p>
<h3>第四章</h3>
<p>（註二）前印度政務官辛博森爵士</p>
<p>就民國二十年六月六日及九月二十六日所公布之本會組織條例曁委員人選觀之、可知國民政府設立本會之目的乃在設置一個顧問機關、使得政府各部分可與各界密切聯絡、恊助政府計劃及施行一個急要的建設程序、至於政府所以遴選各界人士爲委員、並非因其現在政治上之地位關係、實以其個人之才能信譽、卓著於社會、爲各界各業領袖之故、所以由大體觀察、本會確是一個顧問機關但有時各部會長以其爲本會委員之資格、接受本會建議以後、能立使見諸事實、則本會又似一個含有執行性質的顧問機關、</p>
<p>現在政府各機關、對於主管事項之計劃與建議甚多、木會第一件重要工作、卽是將各種計劃審查整理、擇其最爲切要有相互關係、分别先後、於最短期間製成一個可自民國二十一年起三年之内實行的整個計劃、由此觀之本會責任、非常繁重、本會組織條例第三條明白規定、凡國家一切經濟建或發展計劃、其經濟由國庫負担或補助者、應經本會審定呈請國民政府核准、</p>
<p>三、全國經濟委員會之事業、原可望早日有系統之發展、乃以東北事變擴大中原水災聯綿政府迫不獲已、移其心力財力、貫注於彼而該會之發展遂遭頓挫、延至一九三二年初、國都西遷洛陽、遠在内地、政府工作除最急要者外多師停頓、凡此異常之事變、以及因事變所致之商業凋敗、税收减落旣已影響於國庫之收入、而世界經濟衰落之象、中國前以種種原因、未遭波及者、至是亦不能或免矣、</p>
<p>然而全國經濟委員會慘淡經營、仍勞力於建設事業、如賡續水災委員會未竟之工作、增修黃河長江、以及中國中部爲患最烈之漢水贛江淮河等處堤岸輔助江北之水利工程、均其較著者也</p>
<p>至於公路交通方面、全國經濟委員會已實施兩項築路計劃第一項施行於江蘇安徽浙江三省此三省處長江之東端而密邇於中央政府所在地者也、第二項則將第一項計劃擴展至湖北江西湖南河南等四省、其築路所需經費、由全國經濟委員會於路線確定後、就築路基金項下、借撥應需經費百分之四十、交各該管省政府施工、此項辦法、迄今猶在賡績進行而業經完成之公路、已達一萬三千公里、</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會接辦舊有衛生事業、並依照原訂發展衛生事業之三年計劃、以爲建設農村之工具、又在南京設立中央指導技術機關、並組織鄉村實騐區而二者所包含之廣大計劃、均已完成、且中央醫院及中央衛生實騐處亦均成立不但担任指導醫藥及公衆衛生事業抑且常應省市政府之請求兼從事整理地方衛生工作　　全國經濟委員會對於農業一般情形、亦經調查、又在若干省份詳細研究蠶絲業及社會狀况</p>
<p>至於敎育方面、全國經濟委員會對於敎育部之國内外研究工作、亦曾予以恊助、</p>
<p>四、全國經濟委員會之最初二年中、世界經濟益趨　落、東南及報北區域且曾與日軍發生戰事、四南及中部又常苦共匪竄擾、環境雖　、工作則繼續不輟、同時與國聯各技術機關之合作亦賡續進行、</p>
<p>沙格來勃衛生學院主任鮑　熙博士、自一九三○年七月起、被任爲國聯衛生機關駐華代表、凡種種災害所需要之醫藥及衛生急救工作無不參與、</p>
<p>一九三一年十月國聯敎育考察團去華、團員中有前普魯士敎育部長裴克博士、法　西學院敎授郎之文氏前任波蘭敎育部初等敎育司司長華爾司基君、及倫敦大學敎授　納君、此考察團係由國際文化合作會所派卽由該會會長亨利平納君及國聯秘書長代表華爾德君伴同赴華在華研究中國敎育制度、於一九三三年七月編呈報告、對於改革敎育、頗有建議、</p>
<p>一九三一年十一月初、國聯秘書處衛生組組員裘格敎授及黃子方博士、奉派去華、辦理關於水災救濟之緊急預防、及醫藥工作、裘敎授任期三個月、就長江流域調查　疾情形、黃博士任期六個月主辦漢口醫藥救濟事務、同時國聯衛生委員會委員司丹巴博士、參加此項防疫工　作、亦　時數月、</p>
<p>十二月初、又有日内瓦大學地質學敎授巴利加君、維也納大學維司門博士、及諾丁漢大學漢文講師台維君等三人、經中國敎育部長之延聘、得國聯之資助、去華担任南京中央大學講師歷時兩年、</p>
<p>一　三　年一月、國聯復派波蘭華　工務部顧問敖京基君爲國聯運輸交通組代表、並派水利專家蒲得利君同至全國經濟委員會工作迄今猶在繼續工作中、</p>
<p>同月國聯運輸交通組、又應中國政府之請求、委派倫敦土木工程師會會員高得君、巴黎道路樹樑總視察員潘利爾君、及漢　港務局主任因維京君去華研究導淮、及上海港務、華北水利諸問題、其建議意見另詳載全國經濟委員會之水利工程報告</p>
<p>是年十月、前羅馬國際農學會秘書長特賴貢尼敎授經國聯經濟委員會之舉荐、應中國政府之聘、担任研究中國農業情形、其任期爲六個月、所編報告、已於一九三三年送呈全國經濟委員會、</p>
<p>同月意大利蠶桑協會會長瑪利博士、經國聯經濟委員會之指派、應中國政府之聘、去華研究中國蠶絲事業、講求補救之道以謀中國蠶絲業之復興、自一九三四年一月起、被聘急全國經濟委員會之職員、</p>
<p>自一九三三年三月起、國聯經濟及財政組之夏龍氏應全國經濟委員會委員長之請在華勾留六星期、討論世界經濟會議問题、並調節國聯在華各專家之工作、</p>
<p>自一九三三年五月、漢堡熱帶病研究院敎授兼國聯瘧疾委員會委員謨倫司博士、赴華担任研究瘧疾時發之原因並建議應行採用預防方法、</p>
<p>同年之後數月間、前倍爾格拉特社會救濟及公衆衛生司司長司丹博士、經國聯衛生組之派遣、農業恊會秘書克勞遜君經國聯經濟及財政組才派遣、相繼赴華、此皆由於是年七月十八日國聯行政院决議之合作新計劃而來者也、</p>
<p>又國聯秘書　衛生組主任及交通運輸組主任、自一九三一年九月十日、至十二月　十六日、及一九三一年一月一日至八月先後充任技術連絡員、</p>
<p>五、一九三三年春、世界經濟會議集會於倫敦、世界人士咸以爲全世界之經濟及財政危機或可藉國際之恊商與措施、早獲解决、中國政府於四月間、　美總統之招特派行政院宋副院長子文、（兼財政部長全國經濟委員會副委員長）赴美與美政府先事磋商、並率領中國代表團、出席倫敦會議、卽於同年五月、與美國金融復興公司訂立棉麥借欵辦法、旋復與出席世界經濟會議之各代表團及各國實業界領袖、幾度會商研討對經濟發展上合作之前途中國政府遂於此時與國聯行政院訂立技術合作辦法、其内容已詳上文、</p>
<p>六、中國政府因全國經濟委員會爲計劃並實施全國經濟建設之機關、故行政院院長、軍事委員會委員長、立法院院長、財政部部長、及前行政院副院長兼財政部部長宋子文君爲常務委員、又以内政鐵道交通實業敎育等各部部長及智識界實業界以及其他各界之領袖爲委員、俾各界咸得參與、</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會之職掌爲：</p>
<p>（一）關於國家經濟建設或發展計劃之設計及審定事項、</p>
<p>（二）關於國家經濟建設或發届計畫應需經費之核定事項、</p>
<p>（三）關於國家經濟建設或展計畫監督指導事項、</p>
<p>（四）關於特定經濟建設或發展計畫之直接實施事項</p>
<p>上列各項、至爲廣大、實規定該會應有之職掌、非謂在目下創辦時期卽能一一實行也、至於各項事業之計畫督察及實施、則分由各處各專門委員會以及統制委員會改良委員會分别辦理、</p>
<p>統制委員會或改改委員會、均以其業務與該委員會有關連之業務代表組織之、而另以其業務與委員會不相關連之社會傾袖爲之長、此項委員會之計劃、一經全國經濟委員會之採納、該委員會卽負實施之責而於實施之際、並可藉全國經濟委員會以獲得政治上及經濟上之贊助焉、</p>
<p>至於全國經濟委員會之組織方面、則公路水衛生敎育及農村建設諸事、各設有專門委員會爲之討論規劇俟計劃實施時、則設專處主持辦理、</p>
<p>現在已設之處、社有（一）秘書處、該處職員行政人員外、尙有辦理技術事務等之技正八人、及外藉專員六人、（二）公路處、（三）衛生實騐處、（四）水利處、（五）農業處</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會爲進行其經濟建設工作、有舉行經濟調查之必要、然爲避免與已有各機關之工作重複起見、並不專設機關、而以屬之審議委員會、該會以中央研究院總幹事爲主任委員、本會秘書長地質調查所所長等爲委員、凡全國經濟委員會之技術計劃及工作、均交該會審議之、凡應辦之經濟調查事項、亦由該會分交各機關或指定之專家辦理之、</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會、對於組織負實施責任之委員會一節、决定審愼進行、現已成立者僅棉業統制委員會及蠶絲改良委員會而已、</p>
<p>七、全國經濟委員會所用之事業費、自一九三一年起、至一九三三年九月止、共計四百五十五萬元、均取給於政府者也、</p>

<p>（倫敦）國聯技術合作代表拉西曼博士之工作報告書發表後、引起英國輿論熱切之注意、泰晤士報特闢專欄、將報告書摘要刋載、並在第一篇社論中、加以論評、就全文而論、對於國聯專家拉西曼之努力、顯然表示同情、中謂「拉西曼自受命担任對華技術合作代表以來、始終遵照國聯行政院對華技術合作委員會所規定於執行任務時、確守政洽中立之原則、殊無一事足以證明其逾越政治之中立、且日本在日内瓦、本亦贊同對華技術合作之原則、日本如未退出國聯、則並可任技術合作委員會之一委員、致於中國、爲遠東一大共和國、欲以何種對於中國景合宜之方法、尋求外國之援助、决定之權、當在於中國自身、至目前爲止、中國並未向國聯會要求借欵、且中國鐵路行政信用、苟未完全確立、借欵完全作爲原來約定之用途一節、亦未有確實把握時、由外國貸欵於中國、亦殊非所宜、總之、中國内部組織、日益堅强、則全世界自當刮目相待、且中國日益繁榮、尤爲全世界共同之利益、此則固無庸置疑者也云云、反之、工黨機關報「每日民聲報」、評論拉西曼報告書則專就政治問題發揮、批評日本對拉西曼報告書所發表之意見、對於日本帝國主義、作再度之　擊、並諷勸國聯、保護其威信、該報繼又謂、德國與日本邦交、日益增進、最近松下海軍中將之遊德、卽其明證、須知舊德意志皇朝、固拂逆全世界之道德意識、致召覆亡、可爲日本軍閥之殷鑒、但國聯亦不宜僅事虚聲恫嚇而止、當出以堅决之行動、蓋日内瓦堅壁淸野、增加防衛、則日本統治者、縱屬冥頑、亦不敢小覷也云云、（哈瓦斯社十一日電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）孟却斯德指導報今日論拉西曼報告書、謂此中未有對於中國陸軍加以援助、亦未有財政援助之問題、乃日本愛鄰過甚、不許其受國聯之開拓、竟對於拉西曼以專家數人供給中國助其自助之計畫加以重大之疑忌、日本又疑此外尙有以金錢供給中國之惡謀、故發展半官式而理由不充足之警告、使西方勿染指中國、然日本當然並未忘却國聯會員國負有尊嚴義務、必照拉西曼提議之輪廓扶助中國也云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）本日東京朝日新聞登社論題爲「國聯與對華援助」其大意如下、拉西曼博士之國聯對華技術的援助委員會報告書向一般報告聲稱毫無政治的意圖、惟該報告中果全然不含有離反中日關係之政治作用耶、吾人不能不有多少之懷疑、原來國聯何以特選派已有定評之極端排日家拉西曼博士赴華正令吾人苦於諒解、是則國聯自始卽有人選錯誤之感、無論國聯如何聲言對華援助僅以技術的援助爲目的、然對如許之人而期待公明之結果、其何可能、今乃從拉西曼博士聽對華援助技術限定論、其尙有一顧之價値耶、（十一日電通電）</p>

<h3>軍縮僵局中法厲行艦艇政策　鑒於德國重整海軍　造艦程序列入預算</h3>
<p>（巴黎）建造超等巡艦「藤可克」號、或將列入一九三四年度法國海軍預算、該艦排水量約二萬三千噸、此外或將更造與「藤可克」號相似之巡艦一二艘、以完成該式戰艦之戰鬥力、法國决定建造此項新式重艦完全由於德國建造萬噸巡艦而起、德艦雖與凡爾賽和約不相違反、然其威力實非一般巡艦所及、今日法國之造艦計畫、較之兩年前更爲急切、法國之舊艦數艘、不久艦齡告滿、此後擬造馬加度式新驅逐艦代之、新驅逐艦中已有一艘列入一九三四年之計畫中、一九三四年度擬議中之二潛水艇、一作偵察之用、爲一千五百噸、一作巡查海岸之用爲六百噸、兩艦或將替代舊艦、一九三四年之海軍預算載稱、過去數年、法國建造潛艇過多、但仍有種種理由繼續潛艇政策、并改善潛艇機械上之缺點云、一九三四年之海軍預算約爲九一三·○○○·○○○·佛郎、較一九三三年度之預算爲低、此因一九三四年之噸數較受限制、而建造水面戰艦較諸建造潛艇比較省費也、預算中之九一三·○○○·○○○·佛郎、槪括一九三四年至一九三九年之經費、其中二千萬佛郎立將用於繼續一九三四年度造艦計畫、其規定之用途如下、以五百萬佛郎建造新艦、餘下之一千五百萬佛郎則將用於海軍砲隊海岸防守艦隊及軍械云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>德專使　晤英當局密談軍縮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）德軍縮專使里本洛甫今日對記者稱、渠此次來倫敦、係非正式的、故避免作任何談片云、今日里氏往晤西門外相及掌璽大臣艾登、密談約一小時半之久、後據里氏宣稱、彼未與英閣員有其他約期談話事云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據一般人推測、此次里本洛浦與西門艾登談話、歷時甚短、殆因里本洛浦所提出之見解主張、不爲英國方面所贊同、里本洛浦來訪之動機、在表面上係商討軍縮會議產生結果之可能、但據有人探悉、里本洛浦於談話開始時、批評法國軍備政策、並稱德國則志在和平、與法國相反云、當時西門與艾登卽謂彼等對於此種見解、殊難同意、英國不能採取此種立塲、其意若曰、德國重整軍備之政策、不能謂爲志在和平、而對於法國之批評、亦殊欠公允、因此對於此一問題、雙方意見跇離甚遠、無法繼續討論、但一般人相信談話時、並經涉及天空武器之限制或取締問題、蓋唯此一問題、意見尙不至衝突過甚、或有成立諒解之可能也、要之此次里本洛浦之訪問旣經失敗、則此後日内瓦方面所能盡力者、惟能否成立限制天空武器使用公約之一問題而已、蓋亦惟此一問題、或尙有成功之希望也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>漢德森　巴黎會商未有結果</h3>
<p>（巴黎）軍縮會議主席漢德森、昨日與外長巴爾都之一度會談、此間一般輿論、皆因爲尙未產生具體結果、據晨報謂、漢德森意欲向法政府提議一種縮减天空軍備之折衷辦法、然切實言之、此項恊定有無成立之可能、則有待於今日之談判、要之漢德森將於今晚遄返倫敦、彼不欲空手而歸、故深冀此項建議能告成功、庶幾慰情聊勝於無也、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）本日軍縮會議主席漢德森與外長巴爾都會商、至下午四時始畢、據公報發表之消息、本日漢德森與巴爾都第一次交換意見、甚爲懇摯、雙方談話將於明晨繼續舉行云、聞本日談話曾涉及日内瓦軍縮會議之局勢、法國方面今晨國務會議曾完全通過巴爾都所採取之立塲、</p>
<p>此項立塲、具見於四月十七日法國送致英國政府之照會中、卽謂德國不顧條約義務、公然重整軍備一事、如欲使其成爲合法行動、則非法國所能接受云、英國内閣對於法國此種態度、現所考慮之解决方法、今日當已由漢德森向巴爾都有所表示、又倫敦方面以爲如一般軍縮公約不能成立、則不妨訂結一限制天空軍備公約、此種計畫、今晨曾由漢德森切實指陳云、就各種經過事實、詳細研索、則可見法國未必轉變其四月十七日以來所採取之觀望態度、法國際四月十七日照會所表明之觀點外、未必另有他項建議、且一般人對於英國發起訂結限制天空軍備公約一節、亦未抱多大希望、在此種情勢之下、於五月二十五日召開軍縮總委員會會議一事、是否合於時宜、此爲漢德森所當解决之問題、但此一問題决定之權、操之於漢德森、當不因目前談話而受影響、至於法國方面則表示始終主張於五月二十五日開會、蓋此次會議卽無成就、在舉行辯論時、至少可使因德國重整軍備所引起之局勢略見明瞭也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>比國際公法學權威　同情德國軍備要求　法不變態度將自蹈危險　以國聯爲武器終不可恃</h3>
<p>布魯塞爾比利時著名政治學者及國際公法之權威寳萊氏、今日在比京某著名刋物中發表一極有價値而公然表暴之論文、據寳氏之意見、以前之恊約諸邦、今後確有同意於德國軍備上之要求、而與之繼續談判之必要云、比利時前任總理亦稱、今日之德國已異於昔日、因今日之希特勒可代表全國人民發主、而不懼人民之不承認、此實前此史德萊斯曼或勃魯寗時代所不能爲者、且勃魯寗始終並未能與輿論一致、而希特勒之所以獨斷獨行者、實因彼担負其行動之全責使然者云、寳萊氏末節復向法國致一警告、謂據彼個人之見解、法國實在危險途徑之中、因法國在軍縮問題上之反德、係孤立之行動、而彼所恃爲武器之日内瓦、實亦屬可恃而不可恃云、（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國旱災　西部大旱四十年來未有　田產收成損失百分之五十</h3>
<p>廿薩斯美國農業現遭遇一八九四年以來最慘重之旱災、加以颶風捲士及害虫爲禍、以致中西部田地荒廢、小麥及其他農產品每日之損失竟超過一百萬袋之多、據農務部長華雷斯稱、此種旱象、爲美國四十年來所未有、據今日美聯社視察結果、美國農業各州災情嚴重實屬罕見、此次視察區域、包括北部之大湖區域、至南部墨西哥及下加里福尼亞、遠至西部之落磯山、一遍荒蕪、到處塵土飛舞、加以害虫爲災、昨夜雖雨、惟點滴之水、無濟於一般災情小麥收成减半、總數不到五萬萬袋、苟不速降甘霧、則已種新麥、必將全無收成、颶風爲災、加害尤烈、因大風將田中塵土吹去、致穀根均因失土而萎、美聯社得十一聯邦中三百五十二鄉村之報告、均認穀類雖多受損、然各該處均有充足之屯麥、足供全國之用云、農務部長稱、苟美國中西部不能得沛然之雨水、則美國麥穀收成總數不過四五○、○○○、○○○、袋、較平時計短少二十萬袋、然前此剩餘之麥產尙足供全國之需要、據農部報告、春季穀產收穫甚佳、據統計稱、一九三四年之各麥產量應達四六一、○四七、○○○袋、去年爲三五、一、○三○、○○○袋、一、九二七至一九三一年之五年中、平均數爲六三二、○六一、○○○袋云農部又稱、此項旱災及虫災同時毁損密西西密及密蘇里流域麥產、日達一百萬袋左右云、（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>美財部　與銀派隔閡甚深　政府讓步銀派建議相差太遠　銀派一再掙扎已成强弩之末</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）銀派議員今日咸認彼等之建議與政府之讓步相差太遠、參院銀派舉行内部會議後、已將此點證實、財長毛根韜雖預定明日與銀派議員繼續會議、然今日午後參議員湯姆斯聲稱、財部意圖阻碍銀案之任何計劃云、於是可知財部與參院銀派之裂痕愈深矣、湯姆斯宣稱、國會卽使通過銀案、財部亦將阻其施行、故欲政府接受具體購銀計劃、必須喚起全國民意云、湯氏復預測銀案失敗、其結果必形成經濟上不利之發展云、至於財部與銀派之决裂、起於昨日財部與銀派會議、參議員波拉於聆聽至財部草案之第二條時、卽表示不滿、退出議塲、今裂痕旣深、勢須羅斯福總統對於究竟預備接受何種銀案作進一步之决定、據參議員波拉稱、財長毛根韜之建議純爲准可式、而總統則有言在先、任何議案必須命令式也、茲悉財部及銀派議員均將訴之總統、請其表示眞意、據今日參院聲明稱、政府派議員凖備通過任何妥恊案云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅總統將其可遷就白銀派意見之各點、通知財長摩甘索、故澄淸白銀地位之立法案不久可望提出、摩甘索一方面向羅總統報告渠與國會銀派議員會商之結果、一面以財部凖備隨時繼續討論之意通知參院銀派議員、此間有人主張抛棄白銀收爲國有之提議、但有關係者認此層無關重要、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）銀派參議員金氏今日對於銀案形勢仍表示樂觀、據其對報界談稱、「美國將維持以金銀爲貨幣之政策、此本届銀案之梗槪也」云（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）紐約商報華盛頓訪電稱、白銀派議員與當軸談判多時、今聞白銀派所可期獲之結果、不過爲以白銀爲美國合法貨幣凖備金一部份之甚有伸縮性的議案耳、國會領袖已向羅總統聲明、就白銀問題所及、白宫之言、卽爲法律云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國務院　照會戰債國　準備開始談判</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日國務院將戰債照會送致債務國外交代表、内稱、債務國作信用付欵者、在强生案之條規下仍將視爲愆付國云、國務院官員秉承羅斯福總統之政策、面告債務國外交代表稱、美國凖備聆聽核減或淸理戰債之任何建議云、多數戰債將於六月十五到期、然關於此事至今尙無一國正式表示意見、美國司法部長克明最近解釋强生案之條例稱、凡各國能按期作信用付欵者、不作愆付國論、因美國接受此項付欵時、卽明示不再視此等國家爲愆付國也、如美國預發正式通告、則可藉口信用付欵未足償付到期之債務、故仍得援引强生案之條規束縛債務國云、前已作信用付欵者爲英·意·捷克·拉特維亞及立陶宛五國云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院今日聲稱、債務國償還一部份戰債、藉以表示信用之舉動、仍屬不履行義務、可適用禁止貸以債欵之瓊森案、惟信用付欵仍可收受、以免完全停付云、美政府關於戰債之意見、將再詳見於羅總統致國會之咨文中、英美間戰債問題談話之早日復開、當可打開此僵局、國務院人員預料駐美英大使林德賽不久將至國務院唔商此事、查數日前司法部長克明斯曾稱、英·意·捷克·拉特維亞與立陶宛五國非爲瓊森案下之不履行義務者、因其對於欠美戰債已付一部份表示信用也、此説旣出、國會聞之、意見不一、有認此説爲無效者、亦有贊成此説者、外交界認司法部此種判决、甚有益於英國、因淸理戰債之談判可由此復開也、後聞羅總統將在其致國會文中聲明不再收受信用付欵、然今日國務院則謂信用付欵仍可收受、總之美政府態度將於總統致國會文中見之、據路透社電訊、英報批評羅總統關於戰債之意見、謂歐洲債務國未見有償付美國若干萬元戰債之可能、每日捷報今日社論且有羅總統當知英國將不復償還戰債等語、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今晨國務會議曾討論法國欠美戰債問題、提出討論、由外長巴爾都以法國駐美大使特拉蒲賴關於江森法律之意羲範圍及美國司法部長克明斯之解釋所作報告、提交閣僚、加以研究、巴爾都現定星期日赴日内瓦、出席國聯會行政院會議、戰債問題、則將俟巴爾都由日内瓦返國後、再度舉行國務會議、加以縝密研究、又薩爾區域公民投票問題、係國聯會行政院本届會議中議案之一、本日巴爾都特將法國代表團之立塲、予以説明、聞巴氏將在日内瓦要求國聯會行政院樹立種種保障、俾得依照凡爾賽和約之規定、以舉行公民投票云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國極積籌劃　橫跨大西洋航空綫</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國現正籌備橫跨大西洋之航空計畫、其規模之大、不亞於縱貫南美洲之長距離航空綫、深恐法德英等國飛行家捷足先得、故推進此項計畫、可謂不遺餘力、美國飛機巨商一面向國外談判航綫、一面在國内趕造强大無比之海上飛機、而探險家及氣候專家復在格林蘭一帶人跡罕到之地忙於測量工作、另一航空綫則擬經婆馬達至南歐、亦在談判測量中、至於美國航空勢力已伸展至三十三國、大西洋航空飛機六大架現已完成、正開始實習飛航、以備聯絡歐美兩洲之大西洋航空綫一旦開辦後、卽作定期飛航之用、此類海上飛機可載客三十二人、郵件千磅、（十日國民電）</p>

<h3>美國產業復興與外交　紐約通信　　政治動向以經濟爲轉移　外交方面無力援助他國</h3>
<p>美國整個的政治行動、没有别的、前此是聚精會神於藍鷹運動、最近又有所謂「新軌道政策」（Ｎｏｗｄｅａｌ）實際的内容、也和從前差不多、美政府爲复興其國内市面計、每天要消費三千九百萬美金、其中有一千九百萬、是損耗了而收不回來的、所以有人取笑羅斯福總統、説他是一個喝醉了酒的水兵、光是要把錢花出去、别無作用、其實這種評論、也是皮相之談、於美國實際情形、單認得一面、這一面就是農業發展與工業發展不平衡、工業製造品因爲貨幣價値减低、與復興的刺激而提高了、但是農產品如麥片之類、却上漲得非常之少、不過就整個美國經濟情形看、多少有點進步、特别是工業方面、現在據紐約時報的調查、以事業活動指數而論假定其平常狀態、等於一○○、貨物運輸量·本年一月六日爲六六·○、二月十日爲六五·一、三月十七日爲六九·四、鋼鐵製造·本年一月爲五三·○、二月爲五二·九、三月卽昇到七四·二、電力生產數量·一月爲九四·○、二月爲九三·二、三月爲九五·二、汽車生產量·一月爲四一·○、二月爲七四·九、三月爲七七·二、其綜合指數、今年一月六日到三月十七日、就由七八·六漲高到八四·八了、這個數字、與去年夏季的九九·○相比較、誠然還是不及、但是以各個產業部門而論、如貨物輸送量、如汽車製造數量、都比去年略高了些、雖然運貨汽車由二月三日的六○四·一三七輛、到四月七日减低到五五七、九○○輛、但這是一種季節關係、爲了冬去夏來、一般社會所使用的煤炭减少了、所以運貨汽車、也跟着减少了、我們看對各產業部門有密切關聯、而又最爲敏感的電力生產、從二月初間的一百六十三萬六千啓羅瓦特時、到三月底增加到一百六十六萬六千啓羅瓦特時、再則鋼鐵生產量、也足以測知美國市面情形的、據美國鋼鐵恊會發表的數字是、全部工廠的能力、其製綱作業率二月初旬爲百分之三七·五、三月上旬升到百分之四七·七、其漸次低减、到最近又漲到百分之五○·三了、其實際生產的數目、銑鐵在三月中生產了一百六十二萬噸、比上一個月增加了三十五萬六千噸、同月生產鋼鐵二百七十九萬七千噸、比上一個月增加了五十七萬二千噸、本年前三個月、總計與去年同時期比較、銑鐵增加了百分之一四○、鋼鐵增加了百分之一三一、</p>

<p>車、現世界以她爲最多、本年一月生產了十六萬零七百多架、二月生產了二十三萬五千多架、三月約可生產三十二三萬架、四月就恐怕會要迫近四十萬架了、并且汽車工業與其他各部門關係最多、如樹膠工業百分之八十以上、是繫於汽車工業的揮發油工業、也是如此、其次如玻璃板·如鎳·如鋁·如銅鐵·以至銅·鉛·硬木材·等等、都和汽車工業有密切關係、以汽車業的勞枯來决定他們的前途、然則汽車工業的重要地位、是可以推知了、因此普通社會、都注意於此、汽車工廠的工人、更到處高唱着每週三十六小時工作制、并要求增加工資百分之二十、不久以前、幾站釀起全國總罷工、幸經大總統的調解而平息下去、但究竟祇是一時的狀態、幾時將再行爆發、的確難於保證、何况勞工的不安、在美國各工業區、依然繼續存在着醖釀着、所以羅斯福政府還是嚴重的時加警戒、美國國内的情况、旣然這樣的緊張、對經濟復興加緊警備、對於外交、不但是列於次要、并且要以實力—經濟力—爲基本、而定其應付的手段、雖然她還是支持門户開放的主張、但却無力援助旁人了、（四月八日）</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>世界語學習　問題的商榷（一）</h3>
<p>四月二八日先生給廣州熊之佛君關於學習世界語問題的解答，我們認爲在大體上是正確的，但是有幾處讀後覺得尙有補充和商榷的必要，茲將拙見所及略述於後，以就正於先生。　　先生於力説學習世界語的必要之後，還指出世界語反對者的謬誤。反對者斤斤於世界語的人工性，而無視世界語運動進展的事實。所以先生説：一這樣從語言本身去了解世界語運動，自然不會得出正確的結論。」是的，他們的謬誤，一方面固在於蔑視了一世界語運動是隨着整佃新文化運動的成熟而成熟一這一事實，但是他們所以反對「人造語」的根源，却在於沿用了從來觀念論的言語學觀點來衡量世界語之故。觀念論的言語學者，企圖在靜態中去尋求言語的究竟，結果把言語與社會關係分離，把它當作一個自然發生的，孤立的現象，（看呀！他們是怎樣零零碎碎地在考據古音，迷戀骨，以逃避現實啊！他們否認言語的「人工性」，甚至否認言語之合法則的發展。但是正如亞丹斯密所説：「一切的言語都是人造的」，新興言語學告訴我們，言語旣非神授，也不是自然發生的，乃是人類應了實生活的需要而自已創造的。這言語的創製過程，在創造它的人類，過去並未意識到，一直到了人類開始用意識來統制社會生活爲止。人類的言語，是和社會的進化相應，依了一定的法則發展的。人類社會由原始部落生活而入於封建社會，而資本主義社會，而社會主義社會：言語也相應着經過了原始語，方言，民族語（國語），最後必然是，世界共通語等等階段的。現在是資本主義在開始崩潰的時代，一方面各民族語發展到了極大的限度，而同時，在資本主義的母胎中，在民族語之旁，已孕育了未來社會世界共通語的胚胎。但是，資本主義能否完成這世界共通語的任務的呢？是决不可能的。這個不可能，是爲帝國主義時代内資本主義的矛盾所决定的。」而未來的共通語「决不是德語，也不是大俄羅斯語，而完全是另外種語言」。這裏是世界語的言語學上的科學的根據。</p>
<p>自然，上面所謂「人造」，所謂一言語的人工性」，當然不是指任何個人的杜撰，而是實用這言語的大衆的集體創造。世界語的首倡者柴門霍夫説：「一個個人只可能做個首倡者，不可能做一個創造者的」，「我不想規定全部語彙，不想憑我個人的嗜好從頭至尾創造這言語的會部」，「其他的」切應該由人類社會及實生活來創造，正像我們在所有一切的自然語中所看見的一樣」　這是言語集體創造的最好的註釋。當時柴氏給與大衆的是　六條文法以及有限的語彙（只有這一點是柴手手創而爲大家共同遵守的「世界語的基礎」），並同時聲明放棄一切他個人對於這言語的特權，而把這勞作以及其未來的成長完全委諸大衆的實用。「世界語並無任何個人的立法者，也不隸屬於任何個人。世界語首倡者的一切意見與著作，和其他一切世界語者的意見與著作一樣，是絕對私人性質的，無論對誰都没有强制白性質的」。憑了柴門霍夫的這些賢明的民主主義的原則，世界語才爲實用它的（而且在日益龐大起來的）國際大衆不斷地集體創造，逐漸接近於完善之境，而成爲未來社會共通語的胚胎。</p>
<p>其次，我們認爲先生對於獲得基礎知識的理解是過於機械的。某程度的基礎知識，對於新文化運動者自然是必要的。但獲得這基礎知識的門徑，却不限定於機械地看幾本書，而可以有各種各樣不同的道路的。有人從小説中，也有人從銀幕或舞臺上，踏人了這門徑，而開始正確地理解這社會的機構的。此所以文學，電影與戲劇，一向被目爲非大衆的東西，而在大衆文化運動的園地中，也有其存在的充分價値與理由（當然不是説較别的部門來得高貴，但也决不卑下的吧）。而月我們知道，基礎知識的獲得，還應該從實生活中去體騐學取，那麽可以用來滲人國際大衆的實生活中去的世界語，爲什麽没有　樣的價値呢？世界語不正是獲取基礎知識的良好工具之一嗎？這裏，我們來引用日本世界語者秋田雨雀的話，是很的當的：「對於無論何種靑年男女，我都無條件地推薦學習世界語。我確信：世界語是切　年男女進向正確的字古觀，正確的社會觀之門户，之道標。」（羅梭甫陳覺來　）</p>

<p>（中央十一日馬尼刺電）足球錦標重賽問題、尙未解决、第九届未决留待本届之足球錦標、亦因無比賽時間、由中日平分、本届比賽秩序業已排定、十二日爲中對菲、下午五時開賽、我國陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>日畏我國</h3>
<p>（日聯社馬尼刺十一日電）日網球主將佐藤俵太郎氏發表其豫想談如左、菲人久在炎天赤日之下、練習網球有素、尤其加比亞認爲最强之選手、但此外則不足慮、中國選手如林寳華、此次雖未出席、而邱飛海、許承基、林望蘇三人、亦經過酷暑中之練習、反爲吾人之勁敵、荷印選手之技倆、雖爲未知數、但亦素耐暑氣、結局問題、在日選手能否耐暑爲斷耳、</p>

<h3>大會之紀念郵票</h3>
<h3>奪標方法　—女子作表演—</h3>

<p>（五）足球採單循環制、每隊互相交鋒一次、勝者二分、和者一分、負者零分最多者爲錦標、如比賽和局、延長十五分鐘、如再和避、吾國主張重賽、日本主張平分錦標、此問題尙未解决、　　（六）籃球採雙循環制、卽每一隊須與任何敵隊相遇兩次、以百分數計算優勝、如循環賽結果如分數相等時、再行决賽、以定錦標、</p>
<p>（七）排球採雙循環制、卽每一隊對任何敵隊須相遇兩次、以百分數計算優勝、如循環賽結果百分率相等時、再行决賽、以定錦標、</p>
<p>（八）棒球採雙循環制、卽每一隊對任何敵隊須相遇兩次、以百分數計算優勝、如循環賽結果爲百分率相等時、再行决賽、以定錦標、</p>

<h3>中日今晚籃球大戰　實力均等不知鹿死誰手　日本對中菲選手有戒心</h3>
<p>（中央十一日馬尼刺電）本届彭遠運大會、各國選手、均極精鋭整齊、據一般推測、中國可得足球錦標、荷屬印度未足慮、籃球十二晚（今晚）中日首先接戰、中日菲三隊實力相等、不知鹿死誰手、排球中國希望最大棒球菲日有劇鬭、中國恐將　　田徑全能游泳日本可操必勝、我僅可望得分</p>
<p>（日聯社馬尼拉十一日電）日籃球監督黑澤氏語人如左、由菲籃球隊之練習情形觀之、似乎其練習方法、倣傚日本者、但問題在彼等之速攻、日本方面如布置防禦陣容、亦不難取勝此爲日選手所豫想、惟最足驚人者、遠東大會自第六届在大阪開會以來、五次連續出塲之斐洛加諾·三開諾·生斯洛坡·柏諾蘇拉等人、至今健在、且甚活躍、中國選手前次亦經參加、此次均爲身材較高者、故亦不易對付籃球比賽、中日菲旗鼓相當、頗屬大會之偉觀云、</p>
<h3>九項錦標的評價鎭　足球排球網球我國大有希望籃球菲軍穩得棒球亦具雄心　田徑全能游泳將爲日本控制</h3>
<p>第十届遠東運動會、中·日·菲·荷印四國會師菲島、定今日下午二時起、在馬尼拉開幕、自總錦標廢除後、各國之形勢、皆集中於各個錦標之下、茲分述之如次、</p>
<h3>足球錦標　我國希望極厚　爪哇爲勁敵：日菲稱伯仲</h3>
<p>首自足球言之、足球錦標在九届以前、除第一届外、爲我國之禁臠、不容他人染指、自上届在東京與日本戰成平手和局後、日人之野心從此勃發、在其技術言、確已較往日爲勝、然據五日本報之專電、我國敎練黃家駿觀察日本隊練習之後、其技術尙遠遜我國、故日本欲獲足球錦標、殊屬夢想而爲我國唯一之勁敵者、爪哇是也、爪哇選手、習於熱帶、已佔地利之先、但電傳其中之五華僑選手、已有不爲爪哇効勞之説、最多有三人而已、果爾、則我國之足球錦標、實執有把握也、兼以此次大將李惠堂馮景祥俱出任前鋒、攻勢實較上届爲盛、則區區日人、將更不足慮、至於菲律賓、集合馬尼拉之精華、更爲主隊、其實力决不如理想中之柔弱也、</p>
<h3>網球錦標　得失繫於雙打　中日希望相等</h3>
<p>本届網球錦標、我國有恢復一九二八年第八届時之光榮雖林寳華因事不能行、邱飛海許承基林望蘇三人、皆爲我國之精華、苟能於初賽中淘汰日本、不啻則得錦標、是則今日中日之網球、卽爲决賽是也、蓋在爪哇選手、無有能敵許承基者、菲律賓則全仗茄維亞一人、茄維亞雖已進步、奈何獨木難支巨厦、希望甚微也、至於中日間之形勢、佐藤俵太郎與我國邱許必有劇戰、山田則邱許必可操勝算也、苟邱許之雙打能得勝利、我國錦標、已有把握、得失關鍵、全在斯也</p>
<h3>排球錦標　中菲兩國必爭　我國有再得冠軍望</h3>
<p>排球錦標、我國廣州選手偕同南征後希望亦爲極大之一項、爪哇未參加、日本實相差尙遠也、而最後决賽、實爲中菲兩國、此次我國旣合粤港滬三處精英、以組勁旅、實力實在歷届之上、菲島排球、近來確已進步、中菲間之劇烈競爭、自在意料之中、然我國之得勝菲島、將十居其八九、故王正廷總領隊抵菲之日、談話之中、亦將我國希望、安置於排球之上、</p>
<h3>籃球錦標　菲島最有把握　我國祗望勝日</h3>
<p>球錦標、形勢三角鼎立、而以菲律賓爲佔優勢也、此錦標亦爲菲島歷届屈於指上之一、其技術球藝、確非他國所及、故仍以菲律賓爲最有把握與希望、日本自上届我國遭其毒手後、洋洋得意、令人齒冷、且上届在東京舉行、裁判之間、俱有疑問、本届我國選手、集合在一處者、亦已有時、故將來雖未必有得勝菲律賓之把握、今晚先逢日本、必能克敵致勝也、籃球爪哇亦未曾參加、</p>
<h3>棒球錦標　菲島異軍突起　日本實未可樂觀</h3>
<p>棒球一項、我國最爲絕望然並未因藝術之幼稚而氣餒而懼怯、故事前雖有倡不派棒球隊者、卒成重以應戰此運動之精神也、日本擁有棒球錦標已有數届、然本届實大有變化之可能、日本之第一流投手中村峰雄、練習斷踝、將不能登塲獻技、爲日本之大打擊、而同時菲律賓之棒球實力、殊不容我人忽視也、上届菲律賓失敗之原因、在於第一流選手之不能錄用、因菲島好手集中於菲律賓棒球聯賽之下、當時菲體恊會認該聯賽下之選手俱爲職業運動員、摒而不用、今則不然、菲體恊會已承認該投聯賽下之運動員、爲業餘球員、故本届將有二十名之好手、在該聯賽下挑取、以與日本决戰、日本之得勝、實無把握、我國檀香山僑胞惜不能回國效力、否則成績、必可滿意也、</p>
<h3>田徑全能游泳　爲日本所色辦　我國較有得分之希望</h3>
<p>至於田賽徑賽全能及游泳四項、必落日人之手、已毫疑義、第我健兒、倘加努力、或不致全軍覆没、符保盧之撑竿跳、及劉長春之短跑、皆抱有極大希望、至於菲律賓在此四項之中、得分雖必不能如日人之多、而予日人以極大威脅、亦爲必然之事、如田賽之中、托列比哇之跳高、可滿提之鐵球、徑賽之中、耶達耳之中距離、茄西亞之高欄及阿拉布耳及懷特之中欄、皆爲拿手傑作、二百米中日菲實力均等、尤爲日人所引以爲畏者、全能之中、菲選手巴爾德最近創五項新紀錄、接力亦然、游泳菲人亦將未甘落後、如依爾台方索、及齊吉拉姆、皆曾創世界新紀錄者、日人未許樂觀也、</p>
<h3>上海人福音　新聞電台播送　今日起每晚八時後華僑及其美台發出</h3>
<p>本届在菲舉行之遠東運動會、將利用短波電浪、當日比賽情形、卽晚由菲傳滬、廣播全國、菲列濱ＫＺＲＭ電台發電、上海立道飯店裝有短波收音機、專爲接收、再由德律風線轉接ＸＭＨＣ華僑電台（週率七○○）及ＸＱＨＥ其美西人電台（週率一四六○）同時於八時後發播、始於十二日、十三、十四、十七、十八、繼續四天、爲便利華人聽衆、特免請華人譯述一切、</p>

<h3>修改會章案　荷印態度使日悲觀　以下次大會在爪哇開會作交換條件　但下次大會已定中國故日本大失望</h3>
<p>（中央十一日馬尼刺電）遠運執行委員會定十七日或十八日開會、修會章事、料將提出、（電通十一日馬尼刺發）荷印代表布蘭特博士、於十日午會見日本松澤阿部兩代表時、對滿國參加問題、保留諾否之權據聞布蘭特博士希望下次大會在爪哇開會、以此爲其交換條件、表示容納日本希望之好意、然由菲島體恊伊拉連博士所談觀之、則下次大會、已入定在中國上海開會、事實上難在爪哇開會、總之、在日本·方面、預想定期總會之前途、困難益多、故日本愼重研究對策、以導憲法改正問題、滿洲國參加問題等於有利、今後之趨勢、殊爲重視、</p>
<h3>菲田徑成績驚人　我選手成績亦有進步　彭永韾標槍五十二公尺　冷培根鐵餅三十九公尺　符保盧陣寳球均有長進</h3>
<p>（中央十一日馬尼刺電）我國選手十一日仍繼續練習、各人均有進步、擲鐵餅冷培根卅九公尺、推鉛球陳寳球十二公尺七十、撑竿跳符保盧三公尺八十、擲標槍彭永韾五十二公尺、</p>
<h3>菲田徑賽　動搖遠東紀錄</h3>
<p>（馬尼拉十一日電）菲律賓田徑手、今日在大會田徑塲最後練習之成績、竟使還東紀錄、搖動不少、據菲島當局發表者如下、</p>
<p>阿曼蒂鐵餅一三八呎二时</p>
<p>耶達爾千五百米四分六秒六</p>
<p>阿拉勃拉中欄五四秒二</p>
<p>開達列四百米五十秒正</p>
<p>尙有若干、當局嚴守秘密、此項成績、使日本受重大威脅、</p>
<h3>今日棒球　日菲有激烈競爭</h3>
<p>（電通　　日馬尼刺電）第十次遠東亞林匹克大會開會式、定十二日午後二時在棒球塲舉行、各國　手均呈異當常緊張之狀、傾注全力、於最後之練習、各種競技之豫想、已行於比賽開始以前、尤其集中興味者、厥爲棒球、菲島目信此次集中精鋭、編成隊、聲言菲島必勝、日本軍雖因中村峯雄投手受傷、不能出塲、然全體打擊、非常優秀、此點頗受菲島方而以不安、日本人會對於售票、及　授凖備、正爲大規模之活動、</p>
<h3>大雨沛然　中日選手均大喜</h3>
<p>（日聯社馬尼刺十日電）十日下午三時左右、下大雨、消滅酷暑、中日兩國選手、頗喜歡、各項運動停止練習、唯有游泳選手、在大雨之中、悠然繼續練習、</p>

<h3>遠東運動會史略</h3>
<p>— 蔚</p>
<p>（一）發軔時代</p>
<p>當在二十世紀以前、亞細亞的海岸上大小十餘國、人民百萬萬、各自安居樂業、絕少往來、對於體育事業、更無從談起、自從菲律賓成了美國的殖民地以後、從此美人到菲宣傳敎育的人、日多一日、在一九一一年、經美人勃郎氏（ＦｌｗｏｏｄＳＢｒｏｎｒ）提倡和經營之下、遂成立了菲律賓體育恊會、如斯遠東體育恊會也就發軔了</p>
<p>在遠東體育恊會没有產生以前、逢每年的二月、有菲島嘉年華會、會中例必舉行一次盛大的運動會、在前淸宣統三年的那一年、菲島體育恊會發起邀請中日兩國、前往菲島都城馬尼拉參加嘉年華會、當時中國便遣派了田徑和足球選手去參加、日本也遣派了二名網球選手、和棒球隊出席、有了這次的動機、菲島體育恊會遂發起組織遠東體育恊會、並推定了克郎（Ｃｒｏｎｅ）·勃郎·和德蘇萊（Ｔｕｔｈｅｒｌｙ）三人組織委員會、主持一切的籌備事務、</p>
<p>（二）勃郎氏的努力</p>
<p>菲島鑒於這種趨勢、更提議參照世界運動會的成例、由中日菲三國發起組織遠東運動會、每隔一年在東亞各大都市擇地開會、以促進三國的國交、和國民的體育爲本旨、迨民國元年九月、勃郎氏代表菲律賓體育恊會正式訪問中日兩國提出組織遠東體育恊會的原案和意旨、中日兩國覺得有同樣的需要、所以中國便首先毅然加入、而日本也以非正式的名義參加、第一届大會遂於民國二年二月、在馬尼拉趁嘉年華會的會期中舉行中國正式遣派選手到會日本因爲那時日本體育恊會組織尙未完備、没有力量遣派選手所以只派了一隊棒球隊、和兩名田徑賽員出席、各項運動因爲缺乏詳密的組織和規例、所以在那比賽中、未能够得到良好成績第二届大會便在我國上海舉行各國人才、大爲激增、因此成績也精進了許多、日本因而聲明從第三届起、正式加入大會爲會員國、從此基礎大定、凡舉組織大綱比賽細則、也都應有盡有了、</p>
<p>（三）宗旨和目的</p>
<p>而遠東運動會組織的目的原在求遠東各國的大聯合、所以非僅有二三會員國加入就算滿足、當在第一届大會閉幕後、　郎氏就想擴大會務的組織、便親自前往暹京盤谷和新嘉坡等處、力向暹　馬來諸邦遊説他們雖都應允參加、不幸歐戰爆發、海口被封、以致此議成爲泡影、到了民國九年、勃郎氏鑒前功未竟、復作印度爪哇之行、仍規勸他們參加但到了第七届大會、仍未見諸實行、第八届大會舉行於上海時、印度來電欲擬參加、我國覆電歡迎、復又因事未果、到了第九届大會在日本東京舉行、印度才遣派選手、作非正式的參加、</p>
<p>（四）與歐林匹克會的關係</p>
<p>遠東體育恊會和世界歐林匹克委員會比較起來、不啻是一個幼稚的團體、蓋現在遠東運動會的秩序、儘量仿照歐林匹克運動會進行、除限於各國的特殊情形不在此全例外、餘均有相同之處、現在大會會期已改爲每四年　次且與歐林匹克運動會相間行之、以免去時間上的衝突、</p>
<p>查兩會現在的性質與關係、並不同悖、而且有相輔相助的趨勢因歐林匹克委員會對於遠東體育恊會旣無任何條件限制、也並不侵犯牠的特權、而遠東　育恊會　因此也得以增加它本身的聲譽和勢力、且歐林匹克委員會於每次舉行遠東遵動會時輒派委員一人爲專使、並於關係國内、　定有名之體育家、爲歐林匹克委員會的專門代表、以指導關於遠東運動會的事件、　促進其會務的發展、</p>
<p>（五）世界體育界的讚助</p>
<p>在遠東體育恊會成立的時候頗蒙歐林匹克委員會美委員史隆（Ｓｌｏａｎｅ）阿穆斯（Ｏｒｍｏｕｓ）和温特　Ｗｅｎｄｅｌｌ）三人的鼓勵、並拿金花圈一個、贈給遠東運動會、作爲錦標以資奬勵、惟歐林匹克委員會、至一九二○年才正式承認遠東運動會、其所以遲之又久的原因、乃是阻於歐戰、並非不贊成或不注意這個新生的國際組織、這年歐林匹克委員會在盎凡爾開常會的時候、勃郎氏曾代表遠東體育恊會出席、將遠東運動會的目的和成績、詳爲陳述、經各國委員完全贊同、並决定遣派加納治五郎爲歐林匹克的正式</p>
<h3>田徑塲</h3>
<p>代表、參預一五二一年在上海舉行的第五届遠東運動會、當時歐林匹克委員會中的遠東委員、祇有加納氏一人於第五届遠東運動會開幕時、代表歐林匹克委員會致祝辭、並向遠東運動會説明在盎凡爾會議時的情形且把滬會的結果、也報告歐林匹克委員會會長顧伯丁氏、</p>
<p>在那一九二二年的秋天、歐林匹克委員會副會長斐蘭拉都伯爵（卽現任正會長）充任專使由歐赴美、參加九月間在巴西京城舉行的第一届拉丁阿美利加運動會、並擬赴日本大阪參預一九二三年五月的第六届遠東運動會、他的南美旅行、工作頗繁、在會畢以後、復擬考察各國體育情形、原定周遊遠東最後到日本大阪、日本亦已積極凖備歡迎、奈斐氏將由美出發的時候忽接電報、因事召返歐洲、遂致未能成行、此乃遠東運動會對之極爲失望的地方、旋由歐林匹克委員會會長顧伯丁表示、希望由歐林匹克新委員王正廷博士代表歐林匹克委員會出席第六届遠東運動會、但又因中俄外交關係緊張、王氏又未能出席乃仍由日委員加納治五郎氏代表、於開幕時宣讀賀電罷了、</p>
<h3>棒球塲</h3>
<h3>（六）中菲人士對於遠運的貢獻和努力</h3>
<p>遠東體育恊會之得以存在到今日、不得不歸功於　勃郎氏的努力、菲前總督福勃斯將軍Ｈｏｎｇｅｎ　Ｆｏｒｂｅｇ）及故總督伍德將軍（Ｈｏｎ·ｇｅｎＷｏｏｄ）、先後對於遠東體育恊會的組織和發展、均予以莫在原贊助、他如菲之奎松（Ｑｕｅｚｏｎ）亞西斯（Ｏｓｉａｓ）恩曉（Ｅａｒｎｓｈａｗ）美之克郎（Ｃｒｏｎｅ）、麥凱德（Ｍａｒｑｕａｒｄｔ）德蘇萊（Ｔｕｔｈｅｒｉｙ）、英格蘭（Ｅｏｇｌａｎｄ）及我國的故大總統黎元洪、故外交總長伍廷芳博士、前内閣總理熊希齡、前外交總長唐紹儀、和現在中華全國體育恊進會名譽會長王正廷博士、董事長張伯苓博士等、對於遠東運動會均有不少的努力和貢獻、均爲我們所不容遺忘的、</p>
<h3>（七）日人對於遠運的作梗與破壞</h3>
<p>遠東運動會在過去的二十年、表面看起來、好像很順利的向前進行、事實不知經過了幾許波折、而每次部是由日人作祟的、</p>
<p>甲·第二届大會時之二十一條問題民國四年第二届遠東運動會舉行於上海、當時日本正向我國提出二十一條、中日的國交立刻就有將要斷絕的趨勢、日本的興論界、責難日體恊勿參加遠東、但最後仍舊决定參加、旣日選手抵滬、大會已經開幕兩日、當日選手入塲經過看臺之前、曾經觀衆之唾吐、幾乎釀成禍變、幸吾國當事者深明大意、經向觀衆解釋、始得無事、此爲遠東大會波折之一、</p>
<p>乙·第四届大會日人無理要延期問題</p>
<p>民國八年、第四届大會在馬尼拉舉行、不幸會前忽然發生了重大的波瀾、又是日人大發牢騷、惹起大會空前的重大問題、這事發生的原因、源於日本體育恊會、日本體育恊會以爲會期在五日正際學校考試期、函知當事國的菲島、要求將會期推延至八月、菲島體育恊會以爲八月南國多雨不適於大規模的國際運動會、斷然拒絕了日本的無理要求、日本體育恊會老羞成怒、突然宣佈不派選手參加大會、聲明永久脱離退出遠東體育恊會、但此際日本有輿論界大譁、紛紛反對日本體育的此種舉動、日人終自認理屈、仍舊參加大會、此爲遠東運動會波折之二、</p>
<p>丙·第七届大會之日選手退塲風潮民國十四年第七届大會舉行於菲島、大會開幕的第　日、四百米决賽日本野藤是日人認爲最有希望的選手、被取消資格、於斯日本全體選手、齊起抗議、結果竟至全全體退塲、一塲兇險風潮、幸經菲總督伍特將軍、出而調停、於斯日本退出田徑、其他各項比賽、仍繼續進行、此爲遠東運動會波折之三、</p>
<p>丁·本届大會日運動僞國參加之波折</p>
<p>此次大會日人竟不顧世界公義、挾其一手所成立之傀儡國、而要求加入大會、於在滬舉行中日菲常會時、竟提出此無理要求、經吾國代表痛加駁斥、日人復以退出大會爲恫嚇、結果仍自知理屈、依然參加、而遠東大會復從風摧雨殘中脱險、此爲遠東運動會波折之四、</p>
<h3>（八）前途與危運</h3>
<p>試觀遠東運動會肇創二十年、迄今凡上届、而日人從中作梗凡四次、中菲兩國無時不本其初衷對於大會力加擁護維持、而日人則處處破壞之此次大會、雖僥倖開成、然前途尤多暗礁、僞國旣無資格出席大會復挾日人之庇護、擬組織所謂「亞細亞競技大會、一均係破壞遠東大會之害蛆、下次大會在上海舉行、一切均由吾國主持、固無問題發生然待之第十二届大會、復將由日人主辦、此際僞國之參加問題、必將死灰復燃、日亦必提携其參加也、此際之吾國、如無相當之辦法、勢必退出大會也、</p>
<p>吾國旣根本不知有僞國應設法根本消滅僞國、希望在第十二届大會舉行於東京時、吾國政府、已將東北失地收回僞國亦無存在之踪影庶我國之體育界、亦不爲此問題所苦、否則日若容僞加入、我則飲辱退出、世界各國、將笑我體育界之不抵抗也、</p>

<h3>市敎局潘敎局長指示　中校訓導學生方針</h3>
<p>昨召集中學校長訓育主任談話上海市敎育局於昨日下午三時在八仙橋靑年會召集本市中等學校校長訓育主任談話、到滬江附中·光華附中·大夏附中·愛國·務本·敬業·君毅·麥倫·中華職敎·上海中學·南洋中學·華東女中·浦東中學·上海女中·城東女中·束亞體師·愛羣·光夏等一百五十餘校校長訓育主任·韋慤·陳羣·曹惠羣·林衆可·倪文亞·賈伯濤·賈佛如·李好善·廖茂如·閻振玉·王孝英·沈體蘭等二百餘人、由市敎局潘局長訓話、指示中等學校訓導學生之方針、末由曹惠羣廖茂如·陳濟成·李好善·孫樂陶等發表意見、歷兩時許始散、茲錄潘局長訓詞全文如下、</p>
<p>今天市敎育局邀全市中等學校校長及訓育主任來此大家交換意見、商量幾個中等學校的問題、上海之中等學校公家設立的數量很少、僅佔總數不到百分之五、要使全市中等敎育有進步、當然不能僅僅看市立的中等學校、且因市府經費之有限以及其他如地點人力物力種種關係、我們可以很坦白承認市立學校數量　少、實質也不一定比私立的好、或者也可説有許多地方還不及歷史很久辦得很好的私立中學、故我們相信使上海中等學校學生得到好的敎育、一定要公立及私立中等學校彼此交換意見、來共同努力、然後上海中等敎育有向上進步的可能、今天邀請各位在很忙的　間參加此會、無非要把敎育局所希望於今後上海市中等學校要做的幾件事情、藉此機會向各位作一報告、同時也很願意乘此機會可以聽到對中等敎育很有興趣、很有研究及經騐的幾位先生、指示今後上海中等學校應走的大道、和應取的方針、使全市辦中等學校的先生作爲參考、故此會雖無議决案、但如大家承認今天討論的結果是個應走的大路、應取的方針、爲中學生打算選擇最好的路來辦敎育、則中等敎育一定能達到發展之目的、</p>
<p>敎育局所要貢獻的意見、第一須先明白上海中等敎育今後應如何去做、實爲重要的關鍵、有許多人説大學校在過往幾年中發生許多糾紛、都歸罪於大學生、説是不合我們理想、或歸罪於辦學者不能負其責任、其實大學問題很複雜、照敎育行政方面來説、管理高等敎育自有敎育部主　持、並　相信定在那裏打算改進的方法、故我們地方敎育行政機關着手自先注意中等學校、但如果中等學校學生培養得很好、卽使現在大學往往發　問題、過幾年有很多好的中學生進大學、大學也必逐漸改觀、故可以説是間接的爲大學敎育打基礎、並非忽略了高等敎育不過中等敎育依我個人想、中學生年齡是一個正在可東可西變化很多的時期、不比大學生年齡已達相當成熟、故中學生在校内應絕對受敎職員的領導和管理、大學生或者他有自動的活動能力、這問題是另外値得研究的問題、至於中學生、我們並不否認其有課外作業或課外活動的能力、我但敢説一句、中學生的課外活動和課外作業、一定需要敎職員先生來隨時指導、然後可以避免錯領導至正當之路、蓋中學生見識學問都尙在組織時期、如無適當的領導、將不免走入錯誤之路、故中學敎職員對學生所負之責、實在比大學敎職員尤重、想各位都有同樣的感想、但各校以往辦法不同、有的趨於嚴格、有的比較放任、寛嚴不同、結果亦異、在此情形之下、我們當然不能普遍的希望上海中等學校能造成怎樣一種學生了、要達到此希望、一定在訓練上須多加商榷、以求趨向於共同之路、故第一點希望中等學校校長訓育主任應帮助敎育局、敎育局應帮助校長訓育主任、互相完成此領導中學生訓練中學生的重大使命、中學生今後學問之探求、與課外之活動、其領導訓練之責任、完全在敎職員身上、不應讓學生盲動、或者説學生運動或靑年運動、學校不許他動、恐學生反對、或學生有人呌他動、如不許他動、呌他動的人要反對、因有此懷疑猜測、敎職員對學生不肯多負責任去指導、其實、我們並不否認中學生的活動能力、但中學生的活動、一定要在校長訓育主任和其他敎職員指導之下、才能作正當的活動、如中學生不肯受校長訓育主任等的領導、自己去隨便活動、學校方面應嚴格加以糾正、此種糾正的制裁、敎局一定予以帮助、祗要是合理的、是敎職員應做的事、敎局一定要帮助敎職員使學生納於軌範、此種工作、我想有的學校已經在辦、有的學校也一</p>
<p>定計畫在辦、但誠恐有許多學校還不明白敎育局的態度故第一點先將此意提出、向各位作誠懇的希望和祈求、各位爲中學生計、爲整個的社會計、爲將來的民族前途計、不能不趕緊起來負此責任、如再不很堅定的尋此防綫、恐以往數年在大學校中所見的現象、今後或要波及中等學校、如一旦波及、則對於社會民族之損害、其罪惡之大、比大學尤爲加重、將來不可救藥的結果、一定出乎我人預料之外、</p>
<p>第二、今後訓練中學生之方針現在各校一定都有方案以訓練指導學生、今天在此貢獻一個辦法、供各位參考、卽實施新生活運動辦法大綱、敎局擬定此辦法不過是大綱而已、此辦法之實施細目、尤待於各校去詳細訂定、新生活之各詞、不過包含一切平時各種日常生活上應有的改革、實在是很平常的、不是新奇特出的、倘無此新生活的口號或辦法、各校衷練學生訓練得好的話、卽隨時隨地都在那裏實行新生活、但凡事之成當然有許多地方須乘時乘機才能事半功倍、我們乘此時機、把握此新主活運動作爲訓練學生的綱目、一定可以收很大的效果、但新生活雖是平常的事、如做得不好假借名義、則反而壞事、好像新生活之名稱内容、的確很好、應如此做、而學校敎職員及公務機關人員如不想方法如何去實行、則此運動將無結果可言、要實行、一定要敎人考先去實行、所謂敎人者、一種是公務機關人員、一種是學校敎職員、此兩種人必須以自己的實行、感化一般學生夫實行由、學生之實行、再推行於一般家庭與社會去實行、蓋學生在校是求學、在家庭與社會則又可感化人家、可知學校方面的關係重大、故學校方面實行新生活一定要切實寗可接步就班去做、不要希望在一天中什麽都做好、此辦法在敎局不過規定大綱而已其實施步驟、須各學校依環境而訂定每個學校的細目方案希望各校分期的切實去辦、在辦的時候、尤須注意到敎職員本身、才可以敎職員之感　力推動學生、故中小學校的新生活實行辦法、不希望以新生活之名目讓學生在無人指導中去亂做我們須看重做、並不是要空的架子、所謂空的架子、卽如組織分會、辦理選舉、以當選職員爲榮耀、甚至巧立名目互相競爭、老實説、新生活在中小學校中、就是學生之訓練、就是學校中時應該訓練學生之事、不應讓學生、自己去跑錯了路、以新生活之名稱做那别的活動的敲門磚並且絕對不能讓此種走錯路的人蔓延、一定要敎職員毅然起來擔當此責任、由敎職員來訓練、一定可以滅少錯誤而完成新生活運動、這是第二點之希望、要各位校長訓育主任負責的不僅校長訓育主任卽所有敎職員、也都應負此責任、目前學校中有人認爲訓導學生祗、是訓育人員或校長的責任、而敎師可以不負責的、希望各位改變此風氣、務使各校敎職員個個明白領導訓練學生是每個敎員的責任、不是任何一人的責任、我們相信學校中好的敎職員説話的力量、比他人爲大、就可知各位要使校風好、學生紀律好一定要在聘請敎員的時候、同樣注意、如此、然後才可使校風好、對於新生活除訂辦法外、最要的重心、卽須放在敎職員身上、要敎職員以身作則來領導、如學生做得不對、一定要糾正他希望各校趕快去實行、敎局以後將隨時派員視察、</p>
<p>第三點乘此機會要報告的、卽關於敎務的事情、上海已舉行兩次會考、最近敎育部新頒規程、師範畢業生亦應會考、敎局對於此點、曾吾請敎部延緩一學期、其理由以時間局促、敎部頒此規程時、有的師範學校已經考試、有的學校學生在參觀、誠恐躭誤、故呈請延期舉行、關於高中普通科及初中則仍須舉行、小學則仍不舉行、中學會考之科目、由敎部規定其辦法則依照過去情形、再酌擬適當辦法、</p>
<p>因會考、我聯想到個學科問題、會考之目的、一方面使中學程度能比較的畫一、一方面則使學生對課程能格外注意、不過我們畫一程度、專靠會考不能完全達到目的、所以現正考慮如何使各科敎學程度比較的畫一、現在各校各有特别的情形、有的學校國文好、有的英文重、有的數理好等、祗有想法使各校各科敎學進度有劃一的辦法、敎局現擬根據敎部課程標凖、擬編訂各科各學年各學期的進度表、此表不能僅恃敎局人員去編就、恐事實上將來發生困難、故希望與學校合作、以訂一比較可以適用的表、敎局曾通告各校帮助、推舉各科有經騐有研侒的優秀敎員來共同編訂、此上海市中學校各科敎學進度表、此工作擬於五月下旬開始、九月初完成、　備三個半月的時間、編成後、分發各中學校試辦希望此表在二十三年度第一學期起、各班學生程度依此表做去、雖一時不能完全做到、待一年二年後漸漸地做到比較劃一的程度、敎局將隨時派員到各校調查、以此表爲標準不得過快或過慢、使高中普通科及初中有一齊的步伐、而無各科參差之現象、此工作希望各位帮助、如有意見、可隨時報告敎局、</p>
<p>其次、希望中學校敎職員最好專任者多、兼任者少、因欲希望敎員領導學生、兼任者不可能、再以後無論公私立學校、關於交換研究之團體活動、行政方面應由校長訓育主任及敎務主任去擔負、此外敎職員應多、以其心思能力時間用到學校以内、不要再專門跑在學校以外、有一句口號、卽「學校敎職員應到學校去、」普通敎職員大家專心敎學、則學生可不致荒廢學業、此重要之點、我願爲中學生向敎職員請命的、</p>
<p>結束起來、在中學裏無論訓練學科、及團體活動、都要希望敎職員負重大責任要使一般敎職員除敎課而兼負訓育之責、敎局今後對於中等學校進行情形都照此方針與各校密切合作、隨時調查、希望各校帮助敎局以實現上海中等敎育的進步、</p>

<h3>新奇的檢波綫路</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>眞空管用作檢波器，不外屏極檢波和栅極檢波兩法，原理均爲使輸入的高週率電流，經檢波作用後，成單向流行，所以檢波亦可説是高週率電流的整流作用，本篇所述的檢波綫路，雖亦爲整流原理，然綫路奇特，與上述兩法逈異，讀者或尙係初見，且此種綫路，在新出的收音機内，已有採用者，故尤應亟爲介紹。</p>
<p>此種新的檢波綫路，其特異之點有三：一·單一檢波級内，含有兩個三極管，其第一管將輸入的高週率電流使僅能單向流行，以完成檢波目的，故稱爲檢波整流管；（ＤｅｔｅｃｔｏｒＲｅｃｔｉｆｉｅｒ）第二管的作用，卽將此整流後微弱的成音週率跳動電壓Ｘ放大之，以饋至成音週率放大級，故稱之爲檢波放大管，「ＤｅｔｅｃｔｏｒＡｍｐｌｉｆｉｅｔ）二·訊號輸出，不如普通眞空管綫路的接在屏路内，而在栅路回至地綫電接出。三·屏極不加以正電壓，而以之與陰極相連，接通地綫。</p>
<h3>一圖</h3>
<p>説明此檢波綫路的作用，行參閲圖一Ａ，係一簡單的半波整流器，如以Ｓ代表高週率變壓器的次級，則亦可視爲半波或兩極檢波器，次級Ｓ一端連接屏極，一端經電阻Ｒ，接連絲極，當Ｓ受到高週率訊號電壓時，在正半週，屏極吸引電子而有電流經過Ｒ，在負半週則無屏流流行，故完全爲半波整流作用。</p>
<p>再參閲圖一Ｂ，此三極管之屏極與陰極相連接通地線，故與圖一Ａ絲極一端２相合，圖一Ｂ之引線１與圖一Ａ屏極的引綫Ｉ，亦完全相同，所不同者，因此綫路之眞空管，其栅極用作屏極，而將屏極與陰極相連，以减少眞空管的管内電阻。</p>
<p>[PＩ&gt;</p>
<h3>圖二</h3>
<p>ＩP]</p>
<p>圖二示此檢波整流器與檢波放大器合併後的線路，細察此綫路，係一電阻交連放大器，所謂檢波放大級，無異成音週率級的前置放大器，其作用原理，與普通完全相同，故不多述。</p>
<p>採用此種檢波方法，當外來訊號的調幅增加時，其成音週率輸出，亦能與之成直接比例的增加，此卽爲其特有的優點，而他種檢波法所難能者。</p>
<p>如在此綫路内，欲連接拾音器Ｐｉｃｋｕｐ或話筒Ｍｉｃｒｏｐｈｏｎｅ，可接在圖二Ｘ符號處。</p>
<h3>利用二極管的超短波振盪</h3>
<p>— 博淸</p>
<p>所謂超短波的振盪，向來大都專門利用三極管，或電磁管等等的方法，然最近又發現了可以利用二極管的特殊構造隉以振盪超短波的簡單方法了。</p>
<p>這二極管，宛如其名，所以没有栅極，又和電磁管完全一樣，並没有從外部給以强磁塲的必要，是卽愈簡單，振盪的效率愈好。</p>
<p>這二極管的構造，Ｂ和向來的稍異其趣，其中心有直徑一耗的鎢絲製的陽極，以此爲軸，而於直徑一二·五耗的圓筒面内，配置四枝陰極，而由陰極放射出來的電子，因陽極極微細，所以不能將其全部吸收，而其一部，因惰性關係，又由陽極的側邊通過，致重被陽極所吸引，而生運動，其結果，陽極周圍的電子，乃發生振盪。</p>
<p>其連結情形如第二圖所示，Ａ及Ｂ</p>
<h3>第一圖第二圖</h3>
<p>係間隔二糎的並行綫，Ｃ是最大容量約十兆兆分法拉特的變量電容器，又Ｄ係直徑三○糎的圓銅板，而Ａ和Ｂ則貫通其中。</p>
<p>因之照例並不使用屏極阻流圈，只在燈絲方面揷入阻流圈而已。而通常輸出，在五零糎的天綫的腹部，卽約需二五份安培。</p>
<p>屏極電壓在三六零弗打時，雖約得一·五公尺之波長，而以圓板沿ＡＢ移動，或變化　之容量，卽振盪波長，又能於相當範圍内，使其變化。如以Ｄ板接近眞空管，雖能使波長縮短，然，倘過於接近，卽振盪必致停止。</p>
<p>照第二圖的連接，利用外部常數的變化，來檢查振盪波長的影響。則如圖所示，得將並行綫之長度自由變化之，且將Ｃ電容器的振盪狀態，調整至最適當後，卽使其固定，而僅變化陽極方面之長度，則可得如次的波長：</p>
<p>Ｅ波長陽極電壓</p>
<p>○八糎九四糎六○○弗打</p>
<p>一○糎一○二糎六○○弗打</p>
<p>一二糎一○六糎六○○弗打</p>
<p>一五糎一一八糎六○○弗打</p>
<p>如更用同樣的連接，而試將陽極電壓，自五六○弗打變至五四○弗打，卽波長殆固定爲一四○糎，唯輸出卽認爲係依陽極電壓而變化。然限於某陽極電壓，或某特定之一波長，而能得最大之輸出者，依計算所得，其與輸出最大之波長對應的周期，大約相當於電子自燈絲發射至陽極所需時間的三倍。</p>
<h3>新式懷中收音機</h3>
<p>— 思廉</p>
<p>爲减少眞空管計，美國人積極研究，而得來復式收音機出，惟嫌音量及裝置之不滿，故今則有複作用眞空管聞世。上期半解君與作者皆有記載。</p>
<p>今美國利用之而爲最新式之懷中收音機，上期稿中略有附述。此懷中收音機高不足六英寸，闊約四英寸半，厚二英寸有奇，顏色美觀，重約二磅，調度盤置於上，中則爲揚聲器，下爲音量控制器連開關，電源爲一百十伏脱交直流二用。線路見下圖。</p>
<p>所用眞空管爲開勒牌二只。揚聲器爲磁力式，口徑甚小。</p>
<p>圖中雙連變量容器電，製造頗覺特殊。餘電容器及電阻等皆極小。此機以五極管作高放，以三極管作檢波，又利用來復式，使仍回輸至中五極管作第一級低放，輸入，又以五極管作第二級强力放大，故音量宏亮又以２１Ａ７爲整流及五極管之合併管，故雖名爲二管，其音量實可超越五燈機。此機收本埠及中央各電台，可不用天地線，亦能得良好結果，其音量之宏大實爲二管機中之超超者。</p>
<h3>眞空管之過去及現在</h3>
<p>（二續）飛利浦社來稿</p>
<p>（三）發達時代：嗣後眞空管之發達，日新月異，遂應時代这需要，而產生Ｅ４１５號式管，以作特殊檢波及成音週率放大之用，而代替Ｅ４０９號式管，同時高週率簾栅極管Ｅ４４２及電力五極管Ｂ４４３亦相繼而出。迄今Ａ４４２，Ａ４１５，Ｂ４４３三者仍爲業餘家所喜用，而許爲一組完善之眞空管焉。</p>
<p>（四）新的趨向：今日交流收音機盛行於世，收音機之利用交流電源者，已十有八九，但在昔日以交流電源供給於收音機，爲一不能解决之難題，若將五十週率之交流電源供給於收音機，則發出所謂交流音，以干擾收音。欲屏除此種交流音，頗覺困難。嗣後交流用眞空管一出，則前此之困難已盡解决。蓋交流用眞空管中，於燈絲之外，另具有一陰極，專司電子之放射，而燈絲則只司加熱作用，無放射電子之功用，與舊式管頗異其趣。交流管一出，前此之直流收音機幾盡行淘汰，一變而爲今日之交流收音機之萬能時代焉。（待續）</p>

<h3>廉價與贈品</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>天下再公道不過的買賣，自然是「一分行情二分貨但是在上海，却不這麽樣，至少是「一分行情，不止一分貨」。假使讀者在熱閙些的街上，停住了大駕而觀光一下，最普通的，自然是各大小商店的大廉價。而且是像一位師傳敎出來的，一律在透明晶亮的大玻璃櫉窗上，貼上白紙，寫着像用老　的血所寫的紅字招貼，甚麽「不顧血本」啦，「認眞犧牲」啦，「特别减價」啦，「蝕本賤售」啦，五花八門，煞是好看。</p>
<p>除了這麽大吹大擂之外，有的更標明着究竟廉到如何程度。於是從「九折」，「八折」，一直到「對折」而「買一送一」，更由「買一送一」而廉到「買一送二」，由「買一送二」而於「原價一元，减售一角」。顯然的，「一分行情一分貨」，根本不成立，「一厘行情一分貨」，倒還有三分像處。</p>
<p>「原價一元，减售一角」，推車撞壁，再减有些不成一個模樣兒了，那麽，峰廻路轉，來玩一回「贈品」。</p>
<p>於是乎「原價一元，减售一角」之外，再來一個「贈送名貴贈品，以酬惠顧之雅」。若是老　手面闊綽的，更慷而慨之地贈送落地眞空管七七四十九只燈泡無綫電收音機一座，或是穩中五十萬元的航空公路建設奬劵一張。如此開世界廉價與贈品未有之新紀錄·究竟「一分行情」可得「幾分貨」，還該請經騐宏富的會計師來淸算一下。</p>
<p>這麽的廉價贈品，童叟無欺，就是那些善於傾銷的歐美日本商人，也會舌子拖出了半尺，自愧不如。</p>
<h3>茶館</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>某一個星期六下午，閒得没事幹，天又恰下着毛毛雨。大街上散步，似乎有些不方便，於是决計上茶館去「孵豆芽」。</p>
<p>我上茶館，還是有生以來第一次。坐定之後，堂倌泡上茶來。怪，在茶杯裏，我發現了不少像芝蔴般的東西。忙招呼跑堂的。據説，這是上午喝鳥茶的所留下的成績。我聞一知百，領悟了鳥食是可充飲料的。</p>
<p>喝了一口鳥食茶，談玄訪友的張鐵口，忽地顚頭播腦，問我貴庚若干。伸出雞爪般的手來，掄算了一陣陰陽，説我三年之後，得大富大貴。完了，我給了他十二個子，稱謝而去。事後，我後悔，我該待到大富貴之後，再給他錢才對。</p>
<p>接着，上來了十幾位藍布短衫袴，歪戴着打鳥帽的大漢。我嚇了一跳，認爲是俗傳所説吃講茶的了。忙向跑堂的打聽，據説是來標會的。我只才在心中放下了一塊石頭。</p>
<p>上幾位大漢，各自忙着偷俞摸摸地寫就了標子，壓在檯子上。不一會，開標了。「三元半」「三元五角一分半」「三元六角三分半」的大家大驚小怪了一陣，不知如何的一言不合，大胖子拉住一位長腿的，動起武來了。一位矮小的同伴，從身邊抽出一柄利斧來。</p>
<p>我瞧着不對，茶錢也來不及付，在混亂中溜跑了。</p>
<h3>當舖</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>當掉是容易的，贖回來就難。</p>
<p>爲了贖的難，我曾屢次自誓不再走進當舖裏去當東西，然而個人的經濟環境却始終不允許我實踐這誓言，有什麽法子呢，當就當罷，正如陸放翁所説：「有衣可典未爲貧」，到没有什麽可當的時候才眞正是窮途末路列！</p>
<p>雖則我自前當的也已經是很不値錢的東西了。</p>
<p>在親戚朋友之間碰了一鼻子灰，我又沉默地回來檢點東西了。絨線衫，圍巾，破棉袍，都行，祗要「朝奉」不拒絕，當多當少倒是不在乎的。當得少，贖起來比較省力些：有錢，就無需乎當，惟其窮困得利害，才有非贖不可的理由。因爲自審再没有能力來實現那製新的夢想了。</p>
<p>當東西，我是很老練的，别人在那裏和「朝奉」爭持吵鬧，我却早已拿了一張當票和幾個銀元溜出來了。的確，「朝奉」的嘴臉是難看的，但我們有東西當銅錢，也實在日理直氣壯的。我覺得，在親戚朋友之間受呑呑吐吐的奚落，那倒不如進當舗看「朝奉」的嘴臉好了。</p>
<p>在剝削窮人的一點上，當舖無疑是我們的敵人；但在無論何時可以救急的一點上説，當鋪彷彿又是我們的恩人了。</p>
<h3>烟紙店</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>烟紙店這個名詞，似乎只有上海人耳熟能聞，原因是都會裏捲烟一項，儼然成了每個男女日常的消耗品，所以烟紙店在别的城市，還没有駐足的資望，上海任何一條馬路，甚至每個弄口，都有它的踪跡；營業盛衰，組織大小，雖然不同，但是都稱做烟紙店，没有顯著的階級，没有人鄙視過，這是大公司，這是小攤頭；它們主要的業務，並不如它們標榜的專靠經售紙烟，兑換的利益，却不在紙烟之下；上海到處有車輛馳逐着，到處有簇擁的人羣，往來奔放着，掙扎他們的生活：所以上海各業雖呈現極度的不景氣，而每輛車子的乘客，確都有人滿之患！大家厭惡銅元笨重，銀幣兑雙毫，雙毫兑銅元，竟成了烟紙店中心的業務，也是烟紙店有增無已的重要原素：其他火油，火柴，草紙，郵票等，是它們的副業；它們的店員很淸苦，上午六時便要起身，通常十點鐘纔「打烊」，十足十六小時的工作：打烊以後，小窗口裏，照常營業，正式安息，總是十二點鐘了；據説：一月收穫，只在十元左右，一樣的盡仰事俯蓄的責任，三枚銅元兩枝香烟的主顧，也需要客客氣氣應酬出門；他們正和茶樓的堂倌一般，「足不出户，日行千里」咧；這其間還有一都分眞能「自食其力」的女子，便是夫妻烟紙店的「老闆娘」了。</p>
<h3>東吳的色香味</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>東吳大羣這幾天充滿着春氣，春氣氤氲，蔚成絕美的色香味。</p>
<p>纔有兩年歷史的中學生書畫研究會，在前二天展覽作品，同時舉行蒔花會，所以我們踏進了古墅似的林堂，就感到美和幽香，交織成了無限春光，給我們以不可思議的快感。在四間屋子裏，瞧見壁上的書畫，有山水，有人物，有花卉，什麽都惹人歡喜。就是幾個石鼓文，顏柳字，也臨摹得狠見工夫。不到二十歲的靑年，有此佳績，狠不容易了。周匝着我們的有中國的花，外國的花，好似打翻了畫家的寫生箱，五顏六色，令人目不暇給。在花深處，還掛着幾籠葵花，芙蓉，綉眼，不時在唱着自度腔的天籟，眞够味啊！</p>
<p>林堂的光綫，特别地暗，因爲暗，更見得靜，一個天機活潑的大學校，在這時候頓然轉變了，齊入於寗靜淡泊的境界，使幾百個學子，在生活上，環境上，得到一點調節，怪有意思的。不但如此，還有調節，在瀕河的草地上，有幾</p>
<h3>早攤夜捲</h3>
<p>— 摩尼</p>
<p>我的朋友，最近開設一爿南貨店，因上海房價昂貴，祇租一間半房屋，前面一間當做店面，後面半間存放貨物。地方如此狹小，夥計老　，總共倒有六人。我便對這位朋友説：「地方這般狹小，住宿問題，恐難解决。」朋友點頭説道：「是啊！只能店堂裏早攤夜捲了。」我聽了，大惑不解，店堂裏早晨攤出舖蓋，怎能營業呢？這句話，本是俗語，只能付諸一笑。</p>
<p>但是我認爲早攤夜捲這四個字，覺得不大明白，費了半天心思，方始想了出來。原是對於裁縫司務才可能説早攤夜捲，因爲裁縫司務睡在桌檯上的，到了早晨工作，便把衣服攤出來，晚上捲好，安置舖蓋睡覺，如此一想，便覺切當。而今人家店號因地位狹小，就地而臥，都稱爲早攤夜捲，眞是妙不可言。</p>
<h3>開店與關店</h3>
<p>— 維經</p>
<p>上海，眞是不拘甚麽，都有一些兒神秘性的，更其是新開店的大放盤，以及數十年老店一旦關閉之後的拍底貨，眞够把遠近的顧客，吸引得人山人海，把石櫃都擁進了三尺。</p>
<p>我記得在二月前，某馬路上新開一家南貨店。在開幕之前一星期，市上已喧傳着這南貨店開幕時，將有不少廉價貨品發售。因此，南貨店雖定上午八點鐘開幕，而在六點半左右，門口已守候着七八十人。擠在最裏層的，臉上都浮現着笑意。就是站在最外層的，瞧着後來者擠在自己的背後，也都顯着傲慢的微笑。</p>
<p>人是愈聚愈多了，你推我攘，險些兒没打起架來，於是在一陣爆竹聲中，南貨店提前半小時開幕了。一塊錢一隻火腿，便宜。一塊錢八斤白糖，怕也是虧本賣的。主顧指上夾着鈔票大洋錢，没命的向櫃裏送，可是夥友們却老裝着欠多還少的臉，吆喝着。顧客也眞是吐面自乾，滿不在乎。</p>
<p>還有，在去年，某馬路上閉歇了一家老牌子的綢莊。一天，忽地地出淸底貨大拍賣了。不得了，關着前門，開着一扇後門，不到一個鐘頭，樓上樓下，顧客擠得水洩不通，於是索性把後門也關起來了。但是源源而來，不得其門而入的顧客，却儘有在門口徘徊着二三小時而不倦的。也有回家用膳之後，再來恭候，毫無怨言。</p>
<p>開張之喜，顧客盈門，自然是入情入理。營業失敗，而出淸底貨，居然也能吸引顧客，眞有些不可思議。</p>
<h3>茶寮寫眞得意樓上</h3>
<p>— 夏天吾</p>
<p>四全爺叔捲着袖子，擎着個金絲般燦爛的鳥籠，跨上了得意樓的三層樓。</p>
<p>「四爺叔！怎麽連上三天不到？昨天元坤老公説：徐家的老媽子無緣無故和你淘氣，不是？」跑堂的桂生一面從肩上帶下一條堂布拭着桌子，把隔欄邊的。一把椅子拉了上來。</p>
<p>「氣數！年世眞越弄越不對了，天乾地燥，我從來不曾犯過人，却不知那個娘養的，無端造我謠言。」四全爺叔像很生氣似的把鳥籠放在桌上，庇股向後一凸，慢悠悠的坐了下來。</p>
<p>「年世是不對了，得整天喫飽了飯空着嚼白蛆，是有這許多人。」桌子的這一邊，坐着那位素常在這裏要算最健談的邱先生縐了縐二條鼻痕像半笑似的回應四爺叔的話。</p>
<p>桂生轉身已把水烟端了上來，「四爺叔！先呼烟，消消氣吧。」</p>
<p>邱先生性急先問了：</p>
<p>「四爺叔！爲了些什麽事？」</p>
<p>「唉！不是娘養的，無裏尋出有，不知那個見鬼的説，那一天看見我和徐老太婆的大的在永安公司，徐老太婆説：我常對伊的女兒笑迷迷，不是好事；前天平空白地到我面上來兜事，你想這不氣人嗎？」</p>
<p>「嗄唷！這樣一件事，爲什麽在心上呢，靑自靑，白是白，撑了本錢，那一處没有娘兒們，見鬼的事，就値得這樣兜上氣來？」</p>
<p>「不是這樣説的，我氣伊太「撳」人了，想到我面上來看照三錢，我倒不是担這瘟頭銜的人。」</p>
<p>「是的，四爺叔本來是正直人，毎天喝上杯淸茶，玩玩鳥兒，硬「撳」人到别的題目上去是忍不了的。」</p>
<p>四全爺叔似乎是辯白了，轉變了話鋒。</p>
<p>「這幾天柴行廳的頭擋水滸可到武十回了嗎？」</p>
<p>「早過了，早過了，連上精彩了三天，郭老頭子眞有精神，也可説越老越新鮮了，尤其是那一段的顏色着的好。」</p>
<p>「那一段？多血頭嗎？」</p>
<p>「就是那一段，王婆受了西門慶的錢財，便盡心竭力去做那拉攏的勾當，五字訣的口白，西門慶和潘金蓮的勾合，有聲有色，那個不聽了着迷！」</p>
<p>「那你怎麽不來邀我一聲！」四全爺叔像很失望。</p>
<p>「四爺叔喜聽風流話，我倒粗心害你蝕了筆賬。」</p>
<p>四全爺督哈哈哈仰後一笑，把籠子裏的水濺翻在桌上。</p>
<p>種體育表現，我們完了靜的享受以後，再來嘗嘗動的滋味。</p>
<p>恰巧這三種盛會開在蘇州新生活運動的第一天，更給我們一種暗示，「他們的新生活開始了！」</p>

<h3>病囚雜記</h3>
<p>— 嘯龍</p>
<p>（五）不許呻吟的刑苦</p>
<p>手術已完，三個中美日不同國籍看護推着我的病榻，搬進了電梯裏，直到第四層樓我們的病房，然後把我移在我的床位上。</p>
<p>太陽的光漸漸地灰黯了。限於醫院裏面的定章，陪着我來的蘭也不能不走了。剩下我一個人，躺在這陌生的床上，在幾個陌生的同病人中間。空氣是在靜穆中帶點悽凉的。</p>
<p>麻醉藥的效力漸漸地消失，我的喉嚨間的傷口也漸漸地更加痛起來了。我極力地忍耐着。人在寂寞的時候痛苦的感覺似乎是更加鋭敏的。醫生不許我把頭放在枕上，因此那些血時時流到鼻管裏，使我非常地難過，雖然這時候在呼吸方面已經舒服一點，可是因爲血沁出來，不時要把牠吐出，結果比較呼吸的緊促更爲難過。</p>
<p>天色漸漸地黑了。房裏的電燈也亮起來。一直到七點多鐘，到那醫院規定可以凖許家人來探視病人的時候，蘭來了。我雖不能説話，可是是心裏也感到快樂的。傷口的痛楚也似乎减輕了。</p>
<p>快樂的時候是最短促的。時鐘打了八點之後，蘭又得走了。我又得被抛在這裏，度着這痛楚的，漫漫的長夜。</p>
<p>全個夜裏我給痛苦糾纒着。血從傷口滲出來，停在喉間，你不能不把牠吐了出來。可是在每一次咯吐的時候，因爲抽動喉間的傷口，都要使你感到極大的疼痛。我用盡了我的方法使我的注意移到别種思想上去，來藉此忘掉我的傷痛，可是痛得利害的時候，牠又把注意力拉回來了。我的傷口又是在喉嚨，這無異是一種不許呻吟，不許呌喊，和不許聲張的苦刑。這樣，我祗能沉默地，堅忍地、整夜和痛楚搏戰着，一眞到天將破　，正要朦朧地睡着的時候，一根探熱度的水銀針揷進我的嘴來，我的手從暖暖的被窩裏被拉出去把脈，於是我又給那看護的診視把我弄醒了。</p>
<h3>時代的病徵</h3>
<p>— 爰居</p>
<p>古時有許多名士，尤其在六朝，覺得世間只有自己，没有旁人。渠們看不起當日的禮敎，打破一切習俗的倫理，或白眼對人，自以爲有深意：或使酒任氣，一醉六十日。—成爲一種所謂「名士風流」。</p>
<p>但我們這班讀歷史的人，是只讀着有字的歷史的。爲歷史者大槪也還是限於智識階級，也只囿於智識分子的生活以内，於是此外若干層社會的人的生活，未曾有記載。而且除了幾種民間傳説以外，眞所謂歷史者，隨時代堙没了。</p>
<p>「名士風流」是一種「反動思想」，一種對於當日社會不滿意的表現，一種不平。—但，這只限於幾個讀書人，大多又皆是能言而不能行的思想者，是那種「豈不夙夜，謂行多露」的典型，是「儒」者。</p>
<p>社會上之不平，是只有幾個敏感的儒生方覺到的而給發露的麽？除了幾個文人之外，其他階級的人便没有感覺嗎？—有之。武夫的「俠羲」，釋道之「玄虚」，皆可算在這一類的。</p>
<p>三皇五帝的時候不好神仙，（那時大槪没有「時輪法會」），人民比現代精神上要愉快些吧，爲生存的爭鬥，野蠻些，直率些，但也應該仁慈些。及至社會複雜起來了，人類的束縛也加緊了，於是方有「棄家修道」，「入山爲盜」的人們。但無論出世入世，不能離開這地球，結果仍然成了社會上的禍害。</p>
<p>所謂禍害者，無非將不平求其狹義的平而已。强盜掛名是要殺貪官汚吏，俠義開口是要替人打抱不平。當然，他也自有其平與不平在。然而不幸，「不能成其大事」，我們只見凌弱暴寡，爲淵驅魚，成爲老牌黑暗勢力。　　然而「風流」也好，「俠義」也好，「玄虚」也好，不平的質量漸堆積起來，此皆其預徵，詔示將來社會整個的破毁和建設！</p>
<h3>臙脂水</h3>
<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>段小姐懶洋洋地坐在一張軟椅上，眼睛發出誘惑的光亮，兩頰鮮艷得很。</p>
<p>「段小姐，你今晚並不曾盡量呢。」志穆走近段小姐，坐在她身旁。</p>
<p>「不的。蘇先生，我無論如何比你喝得多些罷。」她抗議了。「我現在已經感覺到幾分昏眩了呢。—我不想跳舞，早些回寓所休息去。」</p>
<p>「那却不行的。你走了，誰還高興跳舞！」志穆佷熱烈地説：「我們少不了你的！」</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？」這諛詞居然出自她剛才認爲不幸的蘇先生之口，使她微微地驚駭一下。「那麽，我倒眞要走了，難道你和喩小姐文小姐，就不能跳舞不成？」</p>
<p>「你眞要回寓所休息，請給我一個伴送你回寓所的榮幸罷！」志穆急情地注視着段小姐。　　「謝謝你。」段小姐顯然也高興了。「那很好，我們等一會同時向主人告退就是了。」她爽快地答應。</p>
<p>志穆和段小姐告别了男女主人和其他賓客出來，已經快十一點鐘了。志穆選定了一輛停在旅館前的汽車，開了車門，讓段小姐坐上車去。志穆吩咐了汽車夫幾句話，才進車裏，汽車便風馳電掣地向前奔跑了。</p>
<p>兩個人便絮談起來：從剛才的女主人的新晚禮服，談到巴黎的留學生，又説到紐約的國際學生寄宿舍；回頭又從法國秋季沙龍，談到彼此出國時的南京北平和上海。志穆滔滔地説着，段小姐的談鋒，也被壓下去了。</p>
<p>「剛才在席上你倒和啞吧一樣，現在却張口不能自休了！」她十分後悔剛才對蘇先生所下的輕率的結論，便半抱歉地半誇賞地這們説了一句。</p>
<p>「現在我獨自陪伴着一位美麗的小姐，剛才我是參加一個烏合的席面！」志穆吟味地却又鄭重地説。</p>
<p>段小姐漸漸喜歡這見聞廣遊歷多的蘇先生，她很願意談話便這樣繼續下去。不過她更覺得昏眩了，心頭有些作惡。酒菜像要衝出喉管似地不時翻上來。她微呻着，緊靠着車角上，按住自己的胸脯，暫不出聲。</p>
<p>「你怎樣？」志穆關心地問。　　「這汽車把我搖簸得更昏眩了。爲什麽這樣久還没到我的寓所？」她斷斷續續地説。</p>
<p>「我想立刻就要到了罷。也許某一處所修理街道　，汽車得繞别的路道通過呢。」志穆明知道汽車已穿過了巴黎的中心，往郊外布龍湼森林去。</p>
<p>「我恐怕要嘔吐了，在這汽車裏怎樣辦？她惶急地説。</p>
<p>「你忍住一些罷。」志穆望見車窗外一排排的樹向後退，曉得汽車已經進子布龍湼森林，正繞着大圈子。</p>
<p>彼此都暫時沉默下來。</p>
<p>「我眞忍受不住了！而且身上有些發冷。」她又呻吟着抱怨起來。</p>
<p>「待我看看到底到了什麽街？」志穆伸手先替她繫緊了她秋外套的腰帶，再掀開車帘，向外一望。「啊呀，壞了，他把我們載到布龍湼森林來了。眞可惡，他以爲我們是那些夜遊的靑年男女呢！」</p>
<p>「布龍湼森林！那眞要我的命了！」段小姐絕望地喊了一聲。心裏一急，幾乎嘔吐出來，便忙伸長頸項，仰在車背的軟墊上。</p>
<p>「這是我把街名説得不淸楚的過錯！—旣到了這裏，我們就找一家最近的旅館，讓你休息休息，甚至嘔吐了，再換汽車回寓所去，好不好？」</p>
<p>段小姐不敢回答，怕肚子裏的酒菜，衝了出來。志穆推開前面的玻璃窗，吩咐汽車夫把汽車開到最近的大瀑布旅社去。</p>
<p>到了大瀑布旅社，志穆先下車定好房間，才付了車錢，扶着段小姐出車。旅館前的電燈照出她的慘白的面龐，眼睛也失去平日的神彩，雙眉緊鎖着。她低下頭來，不讓侍役看見她的臉部。機械地倚着志穆的腕，走進了旅社。兩個人同坐電梯，上第三層樓第三十九號房間去。</p>
<p>進房，志穆便把段小姐平放在短榻上。她失了知覺地躺臥着，發出急促的低呻和粗重的鼻息。</p>
<p>志穆按電鈴，女僕敲門進來。　　「先生，我候着你的吩咐。」</p>
<p>女僕恭敬地説。</p>
<p>「太太喝醉了，你得預備一個磁盆，恐怕立刻就要嘔吐起來。嘔吐以後，便替她洗臉，脱去衣服，抱到被裏去。我還到樓下喝一杯咖啡，就返來。」　　「是，先生的。」</p>
<p>志穆仍乘電梯下樓去了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，段小姐先驚醒來，她想翻身去看寓所床邊的自己那幅新成功的油畫。—貪睡在床上，賞鑑自己的傑作，是她近幾個星期的習慣，—可是，她被兩條强韌的臂緊摟着，一點也不能轉動，她才發現她枕旁酣眠着的志穆！昨夜醉酒的一回事，才突的湧現記憶　上來，她羞愧極了，她不暇恨這戲玩了她，而却能熟睡的志穆，她也並不急於要掙脱他的温暖的懷抱，她只伏在志穆的肩上，嚶嚶地啜泣起來。</p>
<h3>平漢綫上</h3>
<p>— 徐</p>
<p>平漢車雖然是在大平原上馳聘，然而逮度却是慢得可憐。</p>
<p>車裝着像貨物一般的，不計件的人，牛似的走着。</p>
<p>聽吧！北段路起時，是滿車的保定一帶氣味。説話掛着「儿　，扯得長長地；到中段，河南老鄉的樸質懇切聲音便又動人耳鼓；如再向南，那麽，一個字便有複音了。</p>
<p>車離開了北平，不久便到蘆溝橋。再向前便可看見那河北省的大禍永定河。這河在春汛期内是汪洋一片，水勢浩大得驚人，水平舖一直到鐵橋邊的堤邊，而冬日，則河身暴露，隆起的沙丘一塊一塊地，水只在兩丘之間結着銀白的冰。</p>
<p>兵，匪，水，旱，蝗，在各地巡行着，車經過的各地，是破敗的。平漢車的脱落了漆皮的列車，行經千餘里被剝刮盡了地皮的土地：一樣的貧困，一樣地掛着瘢疤傷痕。</p>
<p>到一站，兩岸小販便手搖着貨物高呼。回過幾次鍋的燒鷄，蒸得掉了皮的肉包子，硬得像石頭的燒餅，小得像鴿蛋的鷄蛋，喊呀喊的競賣。買客要留神，不是換回一張改字的假角票，便是鷄子有了霉腐味。</p>
<p>飢寒使人行使欺騙呵！</p>
<p>長辛店可以看到這國内有名的修理機塲，使人想起了平漢路的過去，全綫工人對吳佩孚的示威。長辛店是窮地方，站台旁的那個大土堆上連根草也没有。</p>
<p>到保定，可以看到這個失去了繁榮的破落户的慘狀。保定車站上有十多個賣燒鷄的櫃子和賣醬菜的，旅行久的人都知道這是這裏的名產。</p>
<p>路上可以看到人拖着　耕田，老夫婦嘆息着推磨。兵過去，老牛毛驢都離開他們的主人了　　定縣是一個有名的地方啊，它在平漢綫上。車站上人是看不出平敎會的成績的，到是有賣眼藥的嚷得歡。</p>
<p>定州人多鬧眼病，眼皮紅紅地，平敎會的衛生工作應當在這上面顯出成績來。</p>
<p>車，牛似的走。三等裏窗户不齊備，夜裏尖風吹入寒身。平漢車是頭等像二等，二等像三等，三等像什麽呢，比京滬的四等還要壞的。坐車人想到平漢路本身的債務，還能有買新車的要求嗎？可是有「北寗」字樣的車頭，已經在平漢綫上馳騁了。</p>
<p>過黃河，看看鄭州的城牆土。不舒服的睡着，也許在窮的感覺裏，便度過那四十四小時二十分的長途了。</p>
<h3>失眠</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>夜，靜寂的夜，無邊的黑暗之夜！</p>
<p>我　開始失眠了，然而這使我快活。的確，失眠對於我在現在完全成了一件使我高興的事，也許有人不相信我這話，但我是如此忠實地絲毫也不曾説謊。</p>
<p>在白天爲了生活和工作被我遺忘了的友人，一到失眠我便通通記憶起她們和他們來了。每個人的模樣印進我的腦海裏時，我總要細細地聯想到許多事，比方她們的生活，她們的思想和行動，她們不幸的遭遇，她們的窮困和未來的出路，甚至也許連他們都没有時間去思索的種種問題，我都代她們想到了。</p>
<p>四五年來，我常受到朋友們的冷嘲熱駡，她們都説我薄情，不要朋友，其實天知道我是如何地在失眠的夜裏想念她們，爲她們困苦的生活而焦心，爲她們不幸的遭遇而憤慨，因此我常常感謝失眠，牠使我在萬籟無聲的深夜，憶起了我的朋友，我的親愛的父母兄弟。</p>
<p>但是失眠，也有時的確給我痛苦。比方在白天因了工作的忙碌，我完全忘記了自身的一切：忘記了過去的坎珂，忘記了最大的創痛。然而一到失眠的時候，一切痛苦的回憶，深刻的傷痕，都湧上腦海來了。牠們是如此的厲害，好像一把刀在割我的肝腸，無數的箭在射我的心房，一隻猛虎咬破了我的腦袋，而且正在嚼着我的骨頭，吮吸我的鮮血，我難受，我感到天大的痛苦，可是我不能動彈，像患了癱病的人一般連翻身都不可能。胸部壓得緊緊的，於是我流涙了！</p>
<p>每次失眠，都是眼睜地望着天亮。</p>
<p>説良心話，失眠的確給了我不少的好處，比方看書，思考，檢討過去的生活，計劃未來的工作，一切在白天没有功夫想到或做到的事情都可在晚上做完。我常常想到人生實在太短促了，幾十年的光陰像曇花一現似的過去，要做的事太多，如果每個人能以晚上的時間做白天一般的工作，社會將更進步得快，人類也不會像駱駝一般慢慢地在時代後落伍了。</p>
<p>説起來，這是句驚人的話，我已經失眠八年了。在北平時，曾有半年每晚没有睡到一小時以上，這半年我看完了幾本重要的社會科學方面的書，白天雖然精神十分疲倦，但爲了生活的鞭子在我的身上重重地抽着，使我忘記了疲倦，忘記了苦痛，只是爲生活而工作，爲工作而生活。</p>
<p>後來生活轉變了，失眠也比較好了一點，每晚至少也可睡三個鐘頭，誰知道半月來又恢復了在北平時的原態，眼睜睜地望着天花板發白了。</p>
<p>但我並不咀咒失眼，我應該感激牠給與我的好處！</p>
<h3>山舖票（七）</h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>走到那兒去？當然他是富翁了，不過他在明天以前，他還得在蠔殼街躺一夜的，雖則他想是最後的一晚了。</p>
<p>這夜是他第一次爲了快樂，幸福而睡不着，這祗有他在十八歲結婿的前一夜可以彷彿。可是多不同啊！從此以後他是個富翁了！</p>
<p>聽到别的苦力在他耳邊打鼾，他就不禁快樂得要笑出聲來。誰會料到他是已經成了富翁呢？啊，别了，水門汀的人行道！啊，啊，别了，蜈蚣脚般的騎樓！他明晚就要睡在又暖又軟的鋼絲牀上，他要吃油的，穿綢的，坐汽車，</p>
<p>他在等雞啼，他在等工廠裏的汽笛呌，他在等待着天明。</p>
<p>天還没十分亮得透，阿發已經在興隆舖票廠門口踱了幾十個來回了。</p>
<p>五點鐘，六點鐘，淸道夫已經用大竹帚把騎樓底掃完，鄉下人擔着蔬菜，吱咯吱咯的進城來了。</p>
<p>七點鐘，八點鐘，許多小店舖開門了。</p>
<p>九點鐘，大公司都開門了。人也多了起來，車輛也多了起來。</p>
<p>阿發像是鐘擺，每點鐘在這家門口踱二十個來回。他已經把興隆的大門數過幾百次了。從左至右是二十五塊關板門。從右至左，還是二十五塊。每塊門板都是陰沉沉的拉長了臉孔向着他。</p>
<p>胸膛裏有種不吉的預兆在警告他。可是他不敢想，他更不敢相信。這會是太可怕的。</p>
<p>不，門口兩盞熄滅了的燈籠，還像門神似的對站在那兒。牠們守信實，這安慰了他。十點鐘，茶樓裏，酒樓裏，全塞滿了人，塞滿了聲音。</p>
<p>十一點，十二點，許多學生，工人，回家吃飯了，毒太陽直曬到　靑路發軟討饒。可是興隆的門，還不開，而且是永遠不開了。</p>
<p>不久便有許多店夥計跑來，在這二十五塊拉長了的臉孔上，貼上了許多飛票。</p>
<p>他希望自己這次是，在做夢，在發熱病。可是耳朶邊許多聲音，證實了興隆店主的捲逃是眞的。</p>
<p>他想哭，想駡，想打人，可是他渾身没了勁。一絲氣力都没有。他祇是把嘴角向下邊牽了一下。</p>
<p>他突然記起了：他已有一天一夜没有吃什麽東西。</p>
<p>接着便是一陣難忍的飢餓使他不能伸直腰來。（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>標金</h3>
<p>— 驊弓</p>
<p>現代交換社會的特徵之一，大槪是所謂金的賣買。金除了顯示華貴的裝飾的作用以外，不但成爲商品價値的尺度，鑄幣的材料，盡着支付手段及貯藏手段的機能，其本身亦形成商品，以供賣買，爲别一種貨幣表現出其價値。金市塲是交易所。金的賣買是交換的最單純的形式罷，因爲只有賣出同買進的兩種方式，在一定期限内務須交割淸楚，同時在一切都作爲商品來交換的現代，志在牟利，且全然違離「凡作爲商品來交換，必有其本身的使用價値」的交換的前題，故對生活頗少帮助的金的賣買，也卽是最典型的交換形式罷。</p>
<p>一眼看來是最直捷了當，最能獲利的金的賣買，海上寓公，失意政客，經理買辦銀行廠家之流，是交易的中堅份子。一般倜儻的年靑人，以貪其「最直捷了當，最能獲利」，所謂「投機」，亦趨之若騖。</p>
<p>其實事情並不如此單純。金價的動搖，變着一定的世界經濟情况，各國匯兑價格的變動而變動，所謂「牽一髮可以動全身」，更爲一般大户——大抵是銀行錢莊之類，交易動輒數千條，較之零散户頭之七條十四條，相差甚鉅——所操縱着。</p>
<p>近來美國要實現其白銀政策，抬高銀價，積極收買銀貨，金價低落，作「空頭」——早以好價賣出若干條，只等低價補進者，謂之空頭，反之，爲多頭，全是金業的術語——因此可大獲其利。但最近美國突然放棄這政策，出售銀貨，一二天來，金飛漲數十元，作空頭而賺進之數，全部虧蝕怕還不够，五月三日本報所刋的自殺者，雖則投機。日金匯兑，無疑地是直接蒙受影響。</p>
<p>「蘇ＸＸ平時┊┆平時出入各市塲·兼做金業賣買，詎奈時運不濟，屢次虧蝕，先後計達八萬餘元，因此週轉失靈，彌補無術，雖經四出張羅，終屬於事無補，情急無奈，┊┊忽於前日（一日）┊┊私呑生烟圖盡云</p>
<p>美國通貨政策的更動，影響及於投機商，决不止是蘇ＸＸ的自殺，報上不能及無法加以宣佈的事情，比之已宣佈的要多得多，這是我們看報的經騐。</p>
<p>再加以骨子裏頭却有大户的一放縱，一勒收所引起的波漾瀾，排山倒海一般壓迫着零散的小户。金的賣買所賺的只是「扣頭」＿＿所謂賣買的價格的相差——要是不起渡瀾，何能賺錢？</p>
<p>所以，一種變動來臨，大户容易咸覺，容易適應這變動，一撒手，總能有錢可賺，然而隨着浮沉，不知死活的小户苦了，傾家盪產，其實多得很。</p>
<p>據老於此道者言，金的賣買要穩足，要敏捷，要善觀風色，要有决斷，「搶帽子」——金業術語，看凖風色，立刻收進，一得彩，又卽抛出——比較不致吃虧。</p>
<p>總之還是有錢人的事業。有錢人一撒手，便錢可賺，而在有錢人手裏「討生活一的小本經紀人苦透。</p>
<p>世界反正是這世界！</p>
<h3>五月感</h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>閃電般的時光，在日歷的頁子上，可以看出它一天天的消蝕了；五月呀，又是五月了。是我們悲壯沉痛憤激怒號的火一般的五月。從五一，五三，五四，五五，五七，五九以至掀動了整個中國睡態的五卅。每一個節目都有它深刻的意義和藴藏着無窮盡的偉大的力量。</p>
<p>可不是？一幕一幕地在我們眼前展開了：五一勞働階級鬥爭的火燄，威脅了資本家的堡壘，是無產階級勝利的序幕。五三是日本帝國主義鐵蹄蹂躪了我們國土——山東的先導砲。五四是以智識階級爲中心，揭開打倒賣國賊，接受新文化的洗禮，動搖了中國幾千年舊文化的基石。五五是孫中山先生之就非常臨時大總統，和軍閥袁世凱的對抗；一方面是中國民主政治的抬頭，而另一方面是科學社會主義鼻祖馬克斯的誕生。五七五九是軍閥實行賣國的一件事，是日帝國主義者實踐攖奪中國的大企圖。隨着這危機，激動了半生半死的老中國。是大革命的開始，是反帝鬥爭的前奏曲。五卅的爆發，更顯明的揭破帝國主義的眞面目，是他們直接鎭壓中國民族革命的嘗試。</p>
<p>從這些的日子裏，曾經動　了中國空前的大變動，然而</p>
<p>這些的事情，在今日似乎又悄悄地在我們的眼前溜過去了。人們彷彿忘掉了一般似的？以前是怎樣熱烈的紀念，什麽後援會，宣傳隊，雪恥救國團，也有改死隊的組織。而今只好下半旗，停止娛樂以資紀念够了。於是中國人就要被外人譏爲「五分鐘熱血」「中國是健忘」「中國人是只値做奴隸」。其實我們眞的不懂得怎樣去紀念嗎？不—我們不須要作形式土的蠢動，臥薪嘗膽，容忍救國。然而，結果東北四省已經不是我們江山了！滿洲的大龍旗，紅鮮鮮的日章旗，交叉地在天空上自由的飄揚着，這又是怎麽一回事呢？葉靑色的鐵甲車一排一排的從ＸＸ路飛出ＸＸＸ路，行人都驚愕的停住脚步，悞認大戰又要臨頭了，大家好容易才打過一陣冷拦，抽了一。氣，不是開戰，鐵甲車駛過去了，這時候才安心的重開剛才失了作用的呆脚。</p>
<p>可憐的大中國的老百姓呀！我們脚踏中國土，可是不敢説中國話，反要在馬路上情惶失色，爲什麽要這樣示弱？亡國臨頭，奴隸難當，抱了一片悲憤的心，不如讓我們大聲疾呼：</p>
<p>「怒吼吧中國！」</p>
<h3>論糾紛</h3>
<p>— 湘</p>
<p>讀五日本刋同學白君發表伯文章，深表同情，但我另外還有點意見。</p>
<p>他説校中新生活運動促進會主辦的「頟寢室　的整潔比賽」，給一部分的同學所不滿，而主動的原因，是根本不滿於學生自治會的組織，一般所謂風流自賞的同學，和學生會内的「小小政客」，糾紛乃常時醖釀，常時暴發。</p>
<p>這確是學生界普遍的暗幕，廣義的説，也是每一個國家的政治必有的現狀，風流自賞的退隱林泉的高士，旣不肯同流合汚，又不肯高臥無言，不免時常發發牢騷，指桑駡槐，而其結果，除了煽動搗亂以外，别無良策，這種糾紛的暴露，往往没有好的結果。</p>
<p>好像白君所説，敝校那些名士，我深知道，平日是用袖。擦鼻涕，以手巾當脚布，淸狂嘯傲，已弄得慣了，而且在學生會開成立大會時，不願列席參加，選舉以後，榜上無名，又不甘放棄，所以對學生會組織之新生活運動促進會，自有相當的報復，奉行新生活運動的同學，無以名之，名之曰「走狗」，也就是表明自己的身價高尙，不願與「走狗」合作。</p>
<p>其實這種糾紛，便是造成社會紊亂</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Provoking Trouble Again in the Hebei War Zone: Claiming to Have Been Shot at by Our Police in Jixian, Lodging a Protest with Yin Rugeng; Yu Xuezhong Instructs Yin to Negotiate with Shibayama</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 8th, a Japanese plane was spotted over Jixian, dropping leaflets claiming that Japanese soldiers were shot and injured by police forces when they were traveling from Malan Pass to Jixian. The leaflets demanded that the county magistrate be held responsible for handing over the shooter, or else face severe punishment. The Kwantung Army headquarters lodged a protest with Yin Rugeng, claiming that a dozen Japanese soldiers were shot and injured by the county police when passing through Jixian. The Chinese side should (1) pay for medical expenses, (2) formally apologize to the Kwantung Army in writing, and (3) hand over the police officers who fired the shots. On the 10th, Yin Rugeng met with Shibayama Kentaro in Beiping to negotiate. Shibayama deliberately dismissed it as a minor matter, suggesting it could be resolved directly with the Kwantung Army. Yin telegraphed Yu Xuezhong for instructions, who still instructed him to negotiate with Shibayama for a resolution in Beiping. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>People of Yilan Massacred by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A special dispatch from Jilin reports that the people of Yilan County were tragically bombed by Japanese troops, resulting in over 20,000 deaths. The cause of this incident is that the county has fertile land, coveted by the Japanese Colonization Ministry and the South Manchuria Railway Company. This forced seizure of civilian land was directly carried out by personnel sent by the Japanese Colonization Ministry and the South Manchuria Railway, who coerced farmers into forcibly surrendering ten mu of land per person, offering a compensation of two yuan, and ordering them to hand over their land deeds, or else face expulsion by troops. The farmers were enraged and rose up in unison. Within days, over a hundred thousand farmers gathered in the northern Manchuria area. The personnel sent by the Colonization Ministry and the South Manchuria Railway saw that the situation was not good and requested the Kwantung Army to send troops to suppress the uprising. The Kwantung Army immediately dispatched a major leading a large detachment of soldiers to persuade the farmers to disperse, but instead, they were surrounded by the farmers, who seized all their firearms and killed the major with farm implements. The Japanese warlords were furious and sent more troops. Countless farmers were killed, but the farmers were not afraid of death and gathered in ever-increasing numbers. The Japanese troops were helpless and changed their strategy, secretly sending Yamaguchi Kan, the chairman of the so-called Concordia Society, to vigorously persuade the farmers, hoping to lure them into their trap. Both soft and hard tactics were used in conjunction, but the farmers, concerned about their livelihoods, were determined not to yield. The situation has now reached an irreparable point.

<h3>The Lytton Report is Published</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>After the publication of the Lytton Report, Japanese officials recklessly criticized it. The real target of their opposition is not Lytton himself, nor the report itself, but the concrete facts and circumstances after the implementation of the report's recommendations. This can be easily understood without further explanation.</p>
<p>Although technical cooperation between the League of Nations and its member states is the responsibility of the League of Nations, and technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations is China's right. This is purely a matter between the League of Nations and its member states, and no third party is allowed to interfere. Moreover, technical cooperation between the League of Nations and its member states is not new and did not start with China. China's technical cooperation with the League of Nations began as early as the beginning of the 18th year of the Republic of China and did not start today. Japan does not oppose other countries cooperating with the League of Nations, and it only opposes it after expressing its withdrawal from the League of Nations while serving as a member of the Council of the League of Nations. Its insincere political interference is extremely obvious. We believe that the purpose of the Japanese move is, on the one hand, to passively threaten China to stop cooperating with the League of Nations, and, on the other hand, to actively stimulate and control China, forcing it to act hastily, and then using it as an excuse for further partitioning. Or it is to coerce China into dealing with them alone in order to realize their proclaimed Monroe Doctrine of East Asia. Therefore, even if we stop cooperating with the League of Nations due to unbearable pressure from the Japanese, it will still not be enough to slightly reduce their ambition to invade. It can be asserted that now that the Lytton Report has been published, the time for its implementation is even closer. Considering the situation, there is no reason to abandon it halfway. However, we do not have to lose heart because of the Japanese's one-sided opposition, nor can we not carefully consider the difficulties ahead. We believe that the key to whether future technical cooperation with the League of Nations can proceed without unexpected events lies in two points: (1) preventing the Japanese side from sabotaging it, and (2) avoiding the intrusion of political and economic forces of the great powers. These two points are closely related to the investment issue. Recently, the Japanese have opposed cooperation between the League of Nations and China, using the reorganization of old debts as a threat. Their focus is on the financial assistance from Europe and the United States. In the past, the content of technical cooperation between the League of Nations was limited to the hiring of experts and the connection of technical institutions between China and foreign countries, without involving investment. We should still fully understand this meaning and use the local capital as much as possible with the help of experts to create the environment and foundation for future economic construction. Even when foreign capital is needed, it should be utilized only after strictly stipulated conditions are met. For example, the regulation of the cotton and silk industries and the various proposals for water conservancy and road construction mentioned in the Lytton Report all contain serious international investment competition components. When implementing them, we should be very careful. We must know that technical cooperation is a relationship between the League of Nations and its member states, while investment for the implementation of cooperation plans is a relationship between creditors and debtors and should not be confused.</p>
<p>As for the foreign experts, we should only regard them as our consultants and advisors in their individual capacities, not as representatives of their countries. The tasks of each person have been clearly defined, limited to certain types or groups of work, and they should not be allowed to overstep their authority. If this can be done, it can reduce the excuses of the Japanese and the crisis of intrusion by the powers.</p>
<h3>Japan Opposes Technical Cooperation; We Have No Response Yet</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to outside information, after the Japanese side made an unofficial statement on April 17 regarding technical cooperation, it was severely refuted by the international community. The Japanese side also knew that it had caused resentment and then added evasions. After the publication of the Lytton Report, the Japanese propaganda became more intense, even saying that they were prepared to protest internationally. Our country is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the Japanese side's attitude and has not expressed its position yet. If the Japanese side announces a formal document, it will be refuted again. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Full Text of the Lytton Report by the League of Nations Technical Cooperation Representative</p>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>Since the International League of Nations has entered into a technical cooperation agreement with our country, it has appointed Dr. Rajchman, Director of the Health Section of the League of Nations, as its representative for technical cooperation in China. Mr. Rajchman came to China in October of the 22nd year. Recently, the Council of the League of Nations and the China Technical Cooperation Committee are scheduled to meet in Geneva on May 14th. Technical cooperation with our country will also be discussed. Therefore, he left China for Europe on April 10th to attend the meeting and report. Before leaving, he compiled an English report on his work in China for the League of Nations and sent a copy to our committee for reference. Now, we have translated and printed it according to the original report. The wording has not been changed. As for the sections related to our committee, please refer to our committee's other publications for more details.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I.  Upon examining the matter of China undertaking economic construction and technical cooperation with the League of Nations, the Chinese government previously sent a note to the League of Nations Council on June 28, 1933, stating therein:</p>
<p>My government previously sent a telegram to your League on April 25, 1931, stating in brief that my government had decided to establish a National Economic Council as an organ for planning national economic construction, and requesting cooperation with the technical organs of your League in carrying out such work.  Your Council duly submitted this telegram for discussion at its meeting in May of the same year.  In order to make the cooperation effective, my government also put forward several measures as follows:</p>
<p>(1) During the preliminary design and preparatory organization period, the League of Nations may, by analogy with the method of sending commissioners to China to assist in health affairs, send personnel to China to contribute their opinions on construction plans and how the League of Nations can assist in their implementation. The period of stay of such personnel in China shall depend on the actual needs and the convenience of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>(2)  For the implementation of special projects, the League of Nations, at the request of the Chinese government, may dispatch or recommend officials, representatives, or specialists to China to assist.  In addition to possessing their specialized skills, these personnel must be able to maintain constant contact with the relevant technical organs in Geneva.</p>
<p>(3) In special and appropriate circumstances, the League of Nations, at the request of the Chinese government, may designate existing committees or specially established committees to assist the Chinese government in formulating or improving special designs.</p>
<p>(4)  For the sake of future expansion, there is a need to cultivate talent. The League of Nations can use appropriate methods to assist the Chinese government in training talent.  For example, in the field of health, the League of Nations has been able to arrange for Chinese personnel to practice specialized work in other countries, sometimes with subsidies.</p>
<p>(5) In addition, the League of Nations can assist the Chinese government in identifying consultants to assist China in improving its education system and facilitate mutual communication between Chinese and foreign cultural centers.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned measures were approved by your Council at its meeting on May 19, 1931, and the methods for implementing the cooperation proposed by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations were also approved at the same time. The resolution on the first measure is as follows:</p>
<p>The officials dispatched to China in accordance with the first measure should be thoroughly familiar with the work of the League of Nations technical organs and be able to inform the Chinese government on how to utilize these organs. Furthermore, in accordance with the Secretary-General's opinion, one of the heads of the aforementioned technical organs should be stationed in China.</p>
<p>As for items two, three, and four proposed by my government, the resolution of your Council is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the various measures proposed by the Chinese government, the Secretary-General should notify the relevant technical organs to handle them and submit them to the Council for approval in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>More than two years have passed since your Council's resolution. During this period, my government has greatly benefited from the assistance of experts dispatched by the technical organs of your League of Nations and from the two senior officials of the Secretariat of your League of Nations who served as liaisons between my country and the various technical organs of your League of Nations. This person, during his several months of service in my country, performed his duties with remarkable success. Furthermore, the Secretary-General of your League of Nations has repeatedly recommended several technical personnel for my government to employ. For all of these, my government should express its deep gratitude to the Secretary-General of your League of Nations and your Council.</p>
<p>Now that my government has completed its preliminary investigation, it has decided to start economic construction work in several provinces, based on its financial capacity, as a starting point and as a model for the remaining regions of the country.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the success of this economic construction work depends on the continued efforts of all those involved and the appropriate allocation of all undertakings. My government sincerely hopes that the methods adopted by your Council under the present circumstances will enable the continued cooperation between your League of Nations and my government on economic construction. In particular, it is hoped that a technical expert will be recommended and dispatched to my country as the technical cooperation representative of your League of Nations with my government and the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned matters can be submitted for discussion as soon as possible, so that all resolutions can be implemented at an early date, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>II.  At its meeting on June 30, 1933, the Council of the League of Nations resolved to designate the Committee on Technical Cooperation between the League of Nations and China to review how the League of Nations should handle the above-mentioned note from the Chinese government. This committee then convened a meeting in Paris on July 18, 1933, and its resolution was approved by the Council of the League of Nations on the same day. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>The Council of the League of Nations should, at the request of the Chinese government, appoint a representative for technical cooperation, whose mission is purely technical in nature and does not involve politics. In accordance with this principle, the representative for technical cooperation will be the technical liaison officer between the League of Nations and the National Economic Council, handling technical cooperation affairs between China and the relevant organs of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The term of office of the representative for technical cooperation should be one year, and his salary, travel expenses, and living expenses will be provided by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The duties of the representative for technical cooperation are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To provide China with reports on the work of the various technical organs of the League of Nations and, in order to enable China's economic construction to cooperate internationally, to contribute to the Chinese government on how to utilize the various organs of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(2) Upon receiving a request from the Chinese government for technical cooperation, the representative for technical cooperation should immediately forward it to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for transmission to the relevant organs of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(3) The representative for technical cooperation should assist the Chinese government if it wishes to continue to employ foreign technical experts for economic construction work.</p>
<p>(4) The representative for technical cooperation should assist the National Economic Council in properly allocating the duties of the technical experts stationed in China by the League of Nations on the ground. The representative for technical cooperation should report his work to the Council of the League of Nations from time to time, and at least once every three months, in detail. All technical organs of the League of Nations that have cooperated at the request of the Chinese government should also be informed by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations of this report. When performing the above-mentioned duties, if there are matters that require consultation with the various technical groups and technical organs in order to obtain their assistance, he should apply to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Whenever the representative for technical cooperation submits a record of events or a work report to the League of Nations, he should also submit a copy to the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>The Committee on Technical Cooperation between the League of Nations and China appointed Dr. Rajchman, Director of the Health Section of the Secretariat, as the representative of the League of Nations for technical cooperation in China. His duties are as described above.</p>
<p>When informing the Council of the League of Nations of its resolution, the Committee on Technical Cooperation between the League of Nations and China stated that it would continue to listen to the instructions of the Council in order to (1) consider the issues of technical cooperation raised by the Chinese government to the Council of the League of Nations regarding economic construction undertakings, (2) review the reports and statements of the representative for technical cooperation, and discuss or review all issues concerning the performance of the representative's duties.</p>
<p>III.  I obeyed the instructions of the Council of the League of Nations and took office in China on October 3, 1933, in accordance with the methods agreed upon with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>IV. On September 23, 1933, the National Government of China promulgated the revised organizational regulations of the National Economic Council, specially appointing President Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan, President Sun Ke of the Legislative Yuan, and Minister Song Ziwen of the Ministry of Finance as members of the National Economic Council, and all were designated as standing committee members. On October 4, Wang, Sun, and Song took office as standing committee members.</p>
<p>V. Later, Minister Song Ziwen resigned from the position of Minister of Finance, and the number of standing committee members of the National Economic Council was expanded from three to five. The National Government of China then additionally appointed the new Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission as standing committee members. Kong and Chiang took office as standing committee members on December 20 and 27, respectively.</p>
<p>VI. After the standing committee members took office one after another, they discussed in detail the various undertakings to be undertaken or subsidized in 1934, and also reviewed the various economic construction works that were already in progress.</p>
<p>VII. After the National Economic Council completed its preliminary research, it submitted the procedures for technical cooperation with the League of Nations to me for discussion. I sent this procedure to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on December 30, 1933.</p>
<p>In my letter of December 30, 1933, to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, before explaining the main points of the National Economic Council's proposal, I suggested to the Secretary-General that the number of experts selected to go to China for service should be kept to a minimum. The selection of these experts should be based on those who have served in several countries and have rich experience in their work, or they should be prepared to stay in China for a longer period of time so that they can become familiar with local conditions. At the same time, I also stated that the cooperation between the League of Nations' health, transportation, and economic organs and the Chinese government has been extended to 1934, and that a political advisor sent to China is also continuing to conduct research.</p>
<p>The main undertakings planned by the National Economic Council for 1934 were the improvement of transportation, the regulation of water conservancy, and the implementation of large-scale rural construction in several regions.</p>
<p>The National Economic Council believes that highway construction has reached a considerable level and needs to be discussed with engineers who have served in countries with similar situations to China in order to improve it. The issues to be discussed are mainly the following four:</p>
<p>(1) What kind of road surface is most suitable for highways in designated areas?</p>
<p>(2) Methods of using highways.</p>
<p>(3) Locally available fuels.</p>
<p>(4) The most suitable types of vehicles and engines.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Transport and Communications Section of the League of Nations was requested to engage experts to go to China for consultation. As for water conservancy issues, an engineer with international experience was also requested to serve as an advisor to China on the implementation of water conservancy policies.</p>
<p>I suggested that the number of experts dispatched this time be limited to three to serve as advisors, and that each expert should be outstanding in talent and knowledge, and accompany the head of the Transport and Communications Section of the League of Nations to China.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has requested the League of Nations to send education experts to China to discuss how to implement the various recommendations made by the International Education Survey Group sent to China by the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation two years ago, and by the Chinese Education Survey Group sent to Europe in 1932. The Ministry also hopes that the personnel selected by the League of Nations can serve as permanent liaison officers between China and the League of Nations' Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. The duties of the liaison officer should be:</p>
<p>(1) To prepare specialized research materials for educators going to Europe for study.</p>
<p>(2) To identify experts at the request of the Chinese government to serve as advisors to China on the reform of special education matters.</p>
<p>(3) To guide the studies of Chinese students studying abroad.</p>
<p>At that time, the Council of the League of Nations suggested that a person with experience and ability to coordinate educational policies with widespread industrial construction policies should be selected immediately.</p>
<p>The National Economic Council attaches great importance to Professor Terzaghi's agricultural survey in China and hopes that he will return as soon as possible. If Professor Terzaghi cannot accept the invitation to go to China, then the League of Nations is requested to recruit experts with experience in land reform in various agricultural countries in post-war Europe to select outstanding scholars to replace him. Those with experience in the work and methods of the economic committees of Europe, America, and the Soviet Union are particularly suitable for recruitment.</p>
<p>In addition, it was also inquired whether Professor Baileyga could work at the Geological Survey Institute in Beiping. Professor Baileyga was previously appointed by the League of Nations and served at the Central University in Nanjing for two years.</p>
<p>Since 1932, Dr. Mari has been appointed by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations as an expert in sericulture improvement in China at the request of the Chinese government. Since January 1, 1934, he has been employed as a commissioner of the National Economic Council. The Chinese government intends to request the League of Nations to recommend an expert with French sericulture experience to serve in the same position. Part of the salaries of these two sericulture experts will be borne by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>VIII. When the Committee on Technical Cooperation between the League of Nations and China of the Council of the League of Nations met on January 10, 1934, I requested the permission of the Council of the League of Nations to submit a detailed report at a later date because the implementation plan for technical cooperation was still under consideration. Therefore, on the 4th of the same month, I first submitted a short essay outlining the progress, stating:</p>
<p>The Chinese government leaders deeply agree with the motion of the Council of the League of Nations to promote technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China, and the various important groups in China also consider it satisfactory. The standing committee members of the National Economic Council are currently the President of the Executive Yuan, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, the Minister of Finance, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and the important politician Song Ziwen. All agencies are happy to cooperate, and it is expected that the results will be good. The funds for the council's undertakings will be allocated from the US cotton and wheat loan, and it is hoped that a method can be determined soon. The new construction plan is being thoroughly studied. The original construction work on highways, water conservancy, rural construction, education, and public health is still continuing. The 1934 cooperation plan with the League of Nations for the above-mentioned work has been sent to the Secretary-General together with opinions for the technical groups to study. Please allow for a delay in submitting a detailed report. After Chinese and foreign experts have conducted economic surveys and reached conclusions, and the Chinese government has determined a specific plan, a detailed report will be submitted. In the future, reports on various tasks will continue to be submitted to the technical groups as usual, and progress will be reported to the Secretary-General on schedule for verification.</p>
<p>IX. The National Economic Council is currently continuing to carry out sanitation, road construction, and water conservancy projects. The newly determined work is also being investigated and researched in detail by Chinese and foreign staff and experts in accordance with procedures. Mr. Colson and Mr. Stampar are participating in this investigation and research work separately, as described below.</p>
<p>X. The National Economic Council's 1934 business plan was approved by the Standing Committee meeting of the council and then passed by the plenary session of the council on March 26 of this year.</p>
<p>XI. Regarding how to obtain the cooperation of the technical organs of the League of Nations in the various ongoing businesses and the various undertakings planned for 1934, I have exchanged letters many times with the Secretary of the Committee on Technical Cooperation between the League of Nations and China of the Council of the League of Nations, and have discussed them extensively. These letters are of great importance.</p>
<h3>Chapter 1 History of the National Economic Council</h3>
<p>I. In May 1931, the National Government of China decided to establish the National Economic Council. At that time, domestic turmoil was being quelled, and the provinces of Central China, North China, Southwest China, and Northeast China were following the orders of the central government. The world economic crisis had not yet affected China, so there were many hopes for peaceful development. The Chinese government eagerly hoped that technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China could be implemented as soon as possible. When the survey group sent to China by the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation was still en route, and other technical personnel were also about to travel east, the Yangtze River basin (Note 1) suddenly suffered an unprecedented flood. Therefore, the League of Nations, at the request of the Chinese government, appointed the most experienced experts of the League of Nations to serve as the Deputy Chairman of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee (Note 2).</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1931, the economic crisis of the leading industrial countries of the West became more urgent. For example, the United Kingdom's abandonment of the gold standard was a clear indication.</p>
<p>On September 18 of the same year, the Japanese army occupied Shenyang. As a result, the emergency relief work in the Yangtze River basin that the Chinese government was handling and the central economic development agency that was being organized and waiting to be established were frustrated.</p>
<p>I. However, in the midst of these internal and external troubles, the National Economic Council was still able to hold its first plenary meeting on November 15 of the same year. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government and Chairman of the Council, delivered a speech at the opening of the meeting, detailing the purpose of establishing the Council, stating in brief:</p>
<p>(Note 1) Refer to the report of the National Government Flood Relief Committee.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p>(Note 2) Sir John Hubert Marshall, Former Director-General of Archaeology in India</p>
<p>Looking at the organizational regulations of this council and the selection of committee members as announced on June 6th and September 26th of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], it can be seen that the purpose of the National Government in establishing this council was to set up an advisory body so that various parts of the government could closely liaise with all sectors of society, assisting the government in planning and implementing an urgent construction program. As for the government's selection of people from all walks of life as committee members, it was not due to their current political status, but because of their individual talents and reputation, their outstanding achievements in society, and their status as leaders in various fields. Therefore, from a general perspective, this council is indeed an advisory body, but sometimes, after the heads of various ministries accept the council's recommendations in their capacity as committee members, they can immediately put them into practice, so the council seems like an advisory body with executive functions.</p>
<p>Currently, various government agencies have many plans and suggestions regarding matters under their jurisdiction. The first important task of the council is to review and organize these plans, select the most essential and interrelated ones, prioritize them, and, within the shortest possible time, create a comprehensive plan that can be implemented within three years, starting from the 21st year of the Republic [1932]. From this, it can be seen that the council's responsibilities are very heavy. Article 3 of the council's organizational regulations clearly stipulates that all national economic construction or development plans, the economics of which are borne or subsidized by the national treasury, shall be reviewed and approved by the council before being submitted to the National Government for approval.</p>
<p>3. The work of the National Economic Council was originally expected to develop systematically at an early date, but due to the expansion of the Northeast Incident and the continuous flooding in the Central Plains, the government was forced to divert its attention and financial resources to those matters, and the council's development was thus thwarted. By early 1932, the national capital had moved west to Luoyang, far inland, and government work, except for the most urgent matters, had largely come to a standstill. All these extraordinary events, as well as the commercial decline and tax revenue reductions caused by the events, had already affected the national treasury's income, and the global economic recession, which China had previously avoided for various reasons, could no longer be escaped.</p>
<p>However, the National Economic Council, through painstaking efforts, continued to work on construction projects, such as continuing the unfinished work of the Flood Relief Committee, renovating the embankments of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Han River, the Gan River, and the Huai River, which were the most severely affected areas in central China, and assisting with water conservancy projects in Jiangbei, all of which were relatively significant.</p>
<p>As for road transportation, the National Economic Council has implemented two road construction plans. The first plan was implemented in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, which are located at the eastern end of the Yangtze River and are close to the central government. The second plan expanded the first plan to the four provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Henan. The funds required for road construction were allocated by the National Economic Council from the road construction fund, borrowing 40% of the required funds to be handed over to the respective provincial governments for construction. This approach is still ongoing, and the completed highways have reached 13,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>The National Economic Council took over existing health programs and, in accordance with the original three-year plan for developing health services, used them as tools for rural construction. It also established a central guidance and technical organization in Nanjing and organized rural experimental zones. The vast plans encompassed by both have been completed. Moreover, the Central Hospital and the Central Hygiene Experimental Institute have also been established, not only taking on the task of guiding medicine and public health, but also often engaging in organizing local health work at the request of provincial and municipal governments. The National Economic Council also investigated the general situation of agriculture and conducted detailed studies on the silk industry and social conditions in several provinces.</p>
<p>As for education, the National Economic Council also provided assistance to the Ministry of Education's research work at home and abroad.</p>
<p>4. During the first two years of the National Economic Council, the world economy continued to decline, and the southeastern and northern regions experienced warfare with the Japanese army. Southern and central China were often plagued by Communist bandits. Although the environment was difficult, work continued unabated. At the same time, cooperation with various technical organizations of the League of Nations also continued.</p>
<p>Dr. Boudreau, Director of the School of Hygiene in Warsaw, was appointed as the League of Nations Health Organization's representative in China from July 1930 and participated in all kinds of medical and health emergency work required by various disasters.</p>
<p>In October 1931, the League of Nations Educational Mission went to China. The members included Dr. Becker, former Minister of Education of Prussia; Professor Langevin of the Collège de France; Mr. Walski, former Director of Primary Education of the Polish Ministry of Education; and Professor Tawney of the University of London. This mission was sent by the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, accompanied by Mr. Henri Bonnet, the chairman of the committee, and Mr. Wald, the representative of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. They studied the Chinese education system in China and submitted a report in July 1933, making suggestions for educational reform.</p>
<p>In early November 1931, Professor Choucroun and Dr. Huang Zifang, members of the Health Section of the League of Nations Secretariat, were sent to China to handle emergency prevention and medical work related to flood relief. Professor Choucroun served for three months, investigating infectious diseases in the Yangtze River basin, while Dr. Huang served for six months, mainly in charge of medical relief in Hankou. At the same time, Dr. Stampar, a member of the League of Nations Health Committee, participated in this epidemic prevention work for several months.</p>
<p>In early December, Mr. Bailey, a professor of geology at the University of Geneva, Dr. Weismann of the University of Vienna, and Mr. David, a lecturer in Chinese at the University of Nottingham, were invited by the Chinese Minister of Education and sponsored by the League of Nations to serve as lecturers at the National Central University in Nanjing for two years.</p>
<p>In January 1933, the League of Nations again sent Mr. Okinczyc, an advisor to the Polish Ministry of Public Works, as the representative of the League of Nations Transport and Transit Organization, and sent Mr. Potthoff, a water conservancy expert, to work with the National Economic Council, where they continue to work to this day.</p>
<p>In the same month, at the request of the Chinese government, the League of Nations Transport and Transit Organization commissioned Mr. Cotterell, a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, Mr. Pinczon, the Inspector-General of Roads and Bridges in Paris, and Mr. Inveking, the director of the Port of Hamburg, to go to China to study the issues of diverting the Huai River and the port of Shanghai, as well as water conservancy in North China. Their recommendations are detailed in the National Economic Council's report on water conservancy projects.</p>
<p>In October of that year, Professor Dragoni, former Secretary-General of the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, was recommended by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations and hired by the Chinese government to study the agricultural situation in China. His term was six months, and his report was submitted to the National Economic Council in 1933.</p>
<p>In the same month, Dr. Mari, president of the Italian Sericulture Association, was appointed by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations at the invitation of the Chinese government to study the Chinese silk industry, seeking ways to remedy it in order to revive the Chinese silk industry. From January 1934, he was hired as an official of the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>From March 1933, Mr. Shalon of the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations stayed in China for six weeks at the invitation of the chairman of the National Economic Council to discuss the issue of the World Economic Conference and to coordinate the work of various experts of the League of Nations in China.</p>
<p>From May of the same year, Professor Molen, a professor at the Hamburg Institute for Tropical Diseases and a member of the League of Nations Malaria Commission, went to China to study the causes of malaria outbreaks and to suggest preventive measures to be adopted.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, Dr. Stanimir, former Director of Social Welfare and Public Health in Belgrade, was sent by the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and Mr. Clauson, Secretary of the Agricultural Association, was sent by the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations, one after another. This was all due to the new plan for cooperation decided by the Council of the League of Nations on July 18 of that year.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Director of the Health Section and the Director of the Transport and Transit Section of the League of Nations Secretariat served as technical liaison officers from September 10 to December 16, 1931, and from January 1 to August 1931, respectively.</p>
<p>5. In the spring of 1933, the World Economic Conference convened in London. People around the world believed that the global economic and financial crisis could be resolved early through international consultation and measures. In April, the Chinese government, at the invitation of the U.S. President, specially sent Vice President Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan (concurrently Minister of Finance and Vice Chairman of the National Economic Council) to the United States to consult with the U.S. government in advance, and led the Chinese delegation to attend the London Conference. In May of the same year, an agreement on cotton and wheat loans was reached with the U.S. Financial Reconstruction Corporation. Subsequently, consultations and discussions were held several times with various delegations attending the World Economic Conference and leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors of various countries on the prospects for cooperation in economic development. At this time, the Chinese government concluded a technical cooperation agreement with the Council of the League of Nations, the contents of which are detailed above.</p>
<p>6. The Chinese government established the National Economic Council as an organization for planning and implementing national economic construction. Therefore, the President of the Executive Yuan, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, the President of the Legislative Yuan, the Minister of Finance, and former Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Song Ziwen served as standing committee members. In addition, the ministers of various ministries such as Interior, Railways, Communications, Industry, and Education, as well as leaders from the intellectual and industrial circles and other sectors of society, were appointed as committee members so that all sectors could participate.</p>
<p>The functions of the National Economic Council are:</p>
<p>(1) Designing and reviewing national economic construction or development plans;</p>
<p>(2) Approving the funding required for national economic construction or development plans;</p>
<p>(3) Supervising and guiding national economic construction or development plans;</p>
<p>(4) Directly implementing specific economic construction or development plans.</p>
<p>The above items are extremely broad, defining the functions that the council should have, but not implying that they can be fully implemented at the current initial stage. As for the planning, supervision, and implementation of various projects, they are handled separately by various departments, specialized committees, and control committees and improvement committees.</p>
<p>The control committee or improvement committee is organized by representatives of the relevant departments whose work is related to the work of the committee, and another societal figure whose work is not related to the committee serves as its head. Once the plan of this committee is adopted by the National Economic Council, the committee is responsible for its implementation and, during implementation, can obtain political and economic support from the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>As for the organizational structure of the National Economic Council, specialized committees have been established for highways, water, health, education, and rural construction to discuss and plan. When the plans are implemented, specialized departments are established to preside over the work.</p>
<p>The departments that have been established now are: (1) the Secretariat, which, in addition to administrative staff, has eight technical experts and six foreign experts to handle technical matters, (2) the Highway Department, (3) the Health Experimental Department, (4) the Water Conservancy Department, and (5) the Agriculture Department.</p>
<p>In order to carry out its economic construction work, the National Economic Council needs to conduct economic surveys. However, in order to avoid duplication of work with existing agencies, it does not establish a special agency but assigns it to the Review Committee. The Director-General of the Academia Sinica serves as the chairman of the committee, and the Secretary-General of the council, the Director of the Geological Survey, and others serve as committee members. All technical plans and work of the National Economic Council are submitted to this committee for review. All economic survey matters that need to be handled are also assigned by this committee to various agencies or designated experts for handling.</p>
<p>The National Economic Council has decided to proceed cautiously with the establishment of committees responsible for implementation. Only the Cotton Industry Control Committee and the Silk Improvement Committee have been established so far.</p>
<p>7. The operating expenses of the National Economic Council, from 1931 to September 1933, totaled 4.55 million yuan, all of which was provided by the government.</p>
<p>8. The work completed by the National Economic Council during the preparatory period and the projects to be carried out from 1934 will be described in detail in the following chapters.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Opinions in Various Countries After the Publication of the Rajchman Report</h3>
<p>(London) After the publication of the work report by Dr. Rajchman, the League of Nations' technical cooperation representative, it has aroused keen attention from British public opinion. The Times has opened a special column to publish a summary of the report and added comments in the first editorial. In general, it clearly expresses sympathy for the efforts of League of Nations expert Rajchman. It stated, "Since Rajchman was commissioned as the representative for technical cooperation with China, he has always followed the principle of adhering to political neutrality when performing his duties as stipulated by the Committee on Technical Cooperation with China of the Council of the League of Nations. There is nothing to prove that he has overstepped political neutrality. Moreover, Japan also agreed to the principle of technical cooperation with China in Geneva. If Japan had not withdrawn from the League of Nations, it could have even served as a member of the Committee on Technical Cooperation. As for China, as a major republic in the Far East, the power to decide which method is most appropriate for China to seek foreign aid rests with China itself. So far, China has not requested loans from the League of Nations, and if China's railway administrative credit has not been fully established, and there is no real assurance that the loans will be used for their originally agreed purposes, it is not appropriate for foreign countries to lend money to China. In short, as China's internal organization becomes stronger, the whole world should look at it with new eyes, and it is in the common interest of the whole world for China to become more prosperous. This is undoubtedly true." On the other hand, the Labor Party's newspaper, "Daily Herald", commented on Rajchman's report by focusing on political issues, criticizing Japan's opinions on Rajchman's report, and launching another attack on Japanese imperialism. It also sarcastically advised the League of Nations to protect its prestige. The newspaper continued to say that Germany and Japan are increasingly friendly, as evidenced by the recent visit of Vice Admiral Matsushita to Germany. It must be known that the old German dynasty defied the world's moral consciousness, leading to its downfall, which can serve as a lesson for Japanese militarists. However, the League of Nations should not merely engage in empty threats and should take resolute action. If Geneva strengthens its defenses, even the most stubborn Japanese rulers will not dare to underestimate it. (Havas Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian commented on the Rajchman report today, saying that there is no issue of providing assistance to the Chinese army or financial assistance in this report. However, Japan loves its neighbor too much and does not allow it to receive the League of Nations' development, and it has seriously doubted Rajchman's plan to provide China with a few experts to help it help itself. Japan also suspects that there is a conspiracy to provide China with money, so it issued a semi-official and unfounded warning, urging the West not to interfere in China. However, Japan certainly has not forgotten that the member states of the League of Nations have a solemn obligation to assist China according to the outline proposed by Rajchman. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial entitled "The League of Nations and Aid to China," the gist of which is as follows: Dr. Rajchman's report on the League of Nations' technical assistance committee to China claims that there is no political intention. However, does the report not contain any political effects that deviate from the relationship between China and Japan? We cannot help but have some doubts. Originally, why did the League of Nations specially select Dr. Rajchman, an extremely anti-Japanese figure with a well-established reputation, to go to China? This is really difficult for us to understand. Therefore, the League of Nations has had a sense of misjudgment in selecting people from the beginning. No matter how the League of Nations declares that its aid to China is only for the purpose of technical assistance, how can one expect a fair result from such a person? Now, it is only after listening to Dr. Rajchman's theory of limiting technical assistance to China that it has a value for consideration. (Dentsu, 11th)</p>

<h3>Amid the Military Reduction Stalemate, France and China Vigorously Implement Naval Policies: In View of Germany's Reorganization of its Navy, Shipbuilding Programs are Included in the Budget</h3>
<p>(Paris) The construction of the super-class cruiser "Dunkerque" may be included in the 1934 French naval budget. The ship has a displacement of approximately 23,000 tons. In addition, one or two cruisers similar to the "Dunkerque" may be built to complete the combat power of this type of warship. France's decision to build this new type of heavy ship is entirely due to Germany's construction of 10,000-ton cruisers. Although German ships do not violate the Treaty of Versailles, their power is beyond the reach of ordinary cruisers. Today, France's shipbuilding plan is more urgent than it was two years ago. Several of France's old ships will soon reach the end of their service life, and it is planned to replace them with new Magador-class destroyers. One of the new destroyers has already been included in the 1934 plan. The two submarines proposed for 1934, one for reconnaissance use, with a displacement of 1,500 tons, and the other for coastal patrol use, with a displacement of 600 tons, may replace the old ships. The naval budget for 1934 states that France has built too many submarines in the past few years, but there are still various reasons to continue the submarine policy and improve the mechanical shortcomings of submarines. The naval budget for 1934 is approximately 913,000,000 francs, which is lower than the budget for 1933. This is because the tonnage for 1934 is more limited, and building surface warships is less expensive than building submarines. The 913,000,000 francs in the budget include the funding for 1934 to 1939, of which 20 million francs will be used to continue the 1934 shipbuilding program. Its stipulated uses are as follows: 5 million francs will be used to build new ships, and the remaining 15 million francs will be used for naval artillery, coastal defense fleets, and armaments.

<h3>German Envoy Meets with British Authorities to Secretly Discuss Military Reduction</h3>
<p>(London) German military reduction envoy Ribbentrop told reporters today that his visit to London was informal, so he avoided making any remarks. Today, Mr. Ribbentrop visited Foreign Minister Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden for a secret talk lasting about one and a half hours. Later, Mr. Ribbentrop announced that he had no other scheduled talks with British cabinet members. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally speculated that the short duration of the talks between Ribbentrop and Simon Eden was probably due to the fact that the views and proposals put forward by Ribbentrop were not approved by the British side. The motive for Ribbentrop's visit was ostensibly to discuss the possibility of the military reduction conference producing results. However, according to some sources, Ribbentrop criticized France's military buildup policy at the beginning of the talks, saying that Germany was committed to peace, unlike France. At that time, Simon and Eden immediately said that they found it difficult to agree with this view, and the United Kingdom could not adopt this position, meaning that Germany's policy of rebuilding its military cannot be said to be committed to peace, and the criticism of France is also unfair. Therefore, the opinions of the two sides differed greatly on this issue, and it was impossible to continue the discussion. However, it is generally believed that the talks also touched on the issue of limiting or abolishing aerial weapons, because only on this issue were the opinions not too conflicting, and there was a possibility of reaching an understanding. In short, since Ribbentrop's visit has failed, the only thing that Geneva can do its best in the future is whether it can conclude a convention restricting the use of aerial weapons. It is also only on this issue that there is still hope of success. (Havas Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Henderson's Consultations in Paris Yield No Results</h3>
<p>(Paris) Military reduction conference Chairman Henderson's meeting with Foreign Minister Barthou yesterday has generally been regarded by public opinion here as having not yet produced concrete results. According to the Morning Post, Henderson intended to propose to the French government a compromise solution for reducing aerial armaments, but in reality, whether or not this agreement can be reached depends on today's negotiations. In short, Henderson will return to London tonight. He does not want to return empty-handed, so he deeply hopes that this proposal can be successful, so that something is better than nothing. (Havas Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, military reduction conference Chairman Henderson and Foreign Minister Barthou consulted until 4 p.m. According to the news released by the press, Henderson and Barthou exchanged opinions for the first time today, which was very sincere. The talks between the two sides will continue tomorrow morning. It is reported that today's talks involved the situation of the Geneva military reduction conference. The French Council of Ministers this morning fully approved the position taken by Barthou.</p>
<p>This position is reflected in the note sent by France to the British government on April 17, which states that France cannot accept Germany's open rearmament, disregarding treaty obligations, and making it a legitimate act. The British cabinet is now considering solutions to this attitude of France, which Henderson must have expressed to Barthou today. In addition, London believes that if a general military reduction convention cannot be concluded, it may be possible to conclude a convention restricting aerial armaments. Henderson clearly pointed out this plan this morning. After detailed research on various facts, it can be seen that France may not change its wait-and-see attitude adopted since April 17. France may not have other suggestions besides the views expressed in the note of April 17. Moreover, the general public does not have much hope for the UK's initiative to conclude a convention restricting aerial armaments. Under these circumstances, whether it is appropriate to convene a meeting of the General Commission on Military Reduction on May 25 is a question that Henderson must resolve. However, the power to decide this issue is in Henderson's hands and will not be affected by the current talks. As for the French side, it has stated that it has always advocated holding a meeting on May 25. Even if this meeting does not achieve anything, at least the situation caused by Germany's rearmament can be made clear during the debate. (Havas Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>A Belgian Authority on International Law Sympathizes with Germany's Military Demands: France is in Danger if it Does Not Change its Attitude; The League of Nations Cannot Be Relied Upon as a Weapon</h3>
<p>Brussels. Beulé, a well-known Belgian political scientist and authority on international law, published a valuable and frank paper in a prominent publication in Beijing today. According to Beulé's opinion, the Allied countries of the past now have a clear need to agree to Germany's military demands and continue negotiations with them. A former Belgian prime minister also said that today's Germany is different from the past, because today's Hitler can represent the people of the whole country and speak for them without fear of the people's disapproval. This is something that Stresemann or Brüning could not do in the past, and Brüning was never able to agree with public opinion. The reason why Hitler acts unilaterally is that he assumes full responsibility for his actions. At the end of his article, Beulé issued a warning to France, saying that in his personal opinion, France is on a dangerous path, because France's anti-German stance on the military reduction issue is an isolated action, and Geneva, which he relies on as a weapon, is unreliable.

<h3>US Drought: Western Drought Unprecedented in Forty Years, Crop Losses Fifty Percent</h3>
<p>Saskatchewan, United States: American agriculture is currently experiencing the most severe drought since 1894, compounded by hurricanes, dust storms, and pest infestations, leading to the devastation of farmlands in the Midwest. Daily losses of wheat and other agricultural products exceed one million bags. According to Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, this drought is unprecedented in the United States in forty years. The Associated Press's inspection today revealed that the agricultural disaster in various US states is exceptionally severe. The inspection area included the Great Lakes region in the north, extending to Mexico and Baja California in the south, and reaching the Rocky Mountains in the west, all marked by desolation and dust storms. Adding to the calamity is pest infestation. Although it rained last night, the scant rainfall provided little relief. The wheat harvest has been halved, totaling less than 500 million bags. If substantial rainfall does not arrive promptly, the newly planted wheat will face complete failure. Hurricane damage has been particularly severe, as strong winds have blown away topsoil, causing root systems to wither from soil loss. The Associated Press received reports from 352 villages across eleven federal states, all acknowledging significant crop damage, but assuring that sufficient wheat reserves exist to meet national needs. The Secretary of Agriculture stated that if the American Midwest does not receive ample rainfall, the total US wheat harvest would not exceed 450,000,000 bags, a shortfall of 200,000 bags compared to average years. However, previous wheat surpluses are sufficient to meet national demand. According to the Department of Agriculture's report, spring grain harvests were excellent. Statistics indicate that wheat production in 1934 should reach 461,047,000 bags, compared to 35,103,000 bags last year. The five-year average from 1927 to 1931 was 632,061,000 bags. The Department of Agriculture also stated that the combined drought and pest damage in the Mississippi and Missouri River basins is destroying approximately one million bags of wheat per day.

<h3>US Treasury: Deep Rift with Silver Faction, Government Concessions Too Far Apart from Silver Faction's Proposals, Silver Faction's Repeated Struggles Waning</h3>
<p>(Washington) Silver faction senators today generally acknowledged that their proposals and the government's concessions were too far apart. This point was confirmed after an internal meeting of the Senate Silver Faction. Although Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is scheduled to continue meetings with Silver Faction senators tomorrow, Senator Thomas claimed this afternoon that the Treasury Department intends to obstruct any silver-related legislation. Thus, the widening rift between the Treasury Department and the Senate Silver Faction is evident. Thomas declared that even if Congress passes silver legislation, the Treasury Department would impede its implementation; therefore, to get the government to accept a specific silver purchase plan, national public opinion must be aroused. Thomas also predicted that the failure of the silver bill would lead to unfavorable economic developments. The rupture between the Treasury Department and the Silver Faction began at yesterday's meeting when Senator Borah expressed dissatisfaction and left the session upon hearing the second clause of the Treasury Department's draft. With the rift now deep, President Roosevelt must make a further decision on which silver bill he is prepared to accept. According to Senator Borah, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau's proposal is purely permissive, while the President had previously stated that any bill must be mandatory. It is now understood that both the Treasury Department and Silver Faction senators will appeal to the President, requesting his true intentions. According to a statement from the Senate today, government-aligned senators are prepared to pass any compromise bill. (10th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has informed Treasury Secretary Morgenthau of the points on which he can accommodate the silver faction's views, so legislation clarifying the status of silver is expected to be introduced soon. Morgenthau reported to President Roosevelt on the results of his consultations with congressional silver faction senators and notified the Senate silver faction senators that the Treasury Department is prepared to continue discussions at any time. Some advocate abandoning the proposal to nationalize silver, but those involved believe this is inconsequential. (10th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Silver faction Senator King stated today that he remains optimistic about the prospects for silver legislation. According to his remarks to the press, "The United States will maintain a policy of gold and silver as currency; this is the gist of this silver bill." (10th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Commercial Bulletin's Washington dispatch reports that after prolonged negotiations between silver faction senators and the authorities, it is now rumored that the most the silver faction can expect is a very flexible bill that allows silver to be part of the US legal tender reserve. Congressional leaders have stated to President Roosevelt that, as far as the silver issue is concerned, what the White House says is law. (11th Reuters)</p>
<h3>US State Department: Note to War Debt Nations, Prepared to Begin Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the State Department sent a note to the foreign diplomatic representatives of the war debt nations, stating that debtor nations making credit payments will still be considered delinquent under the provisions of the Johnson Act. State Department officials, adhering to President Roosevelt's policy, informed the foreign diplomatic representatives of the debtor nations that the United States is prepared to listen to any suggestions for reducing or settling war debts. Most war debts are due on June 15, but to date, no country has formally expressed its opinion on the matter. US Attorney General Cummings recently interpreted the provisions of the Johnson Act, stating that countries making credit payments on time should not be considered delinquent, because when the United States accepted these payments, it explicitly stated that it would no longer consider these countries delinquent. If the United States issues a formal notification in advance, it can claim that credit payments are insufficient to cover maturing debts and still invoke the provisions of the Johnson Act to bind debtor nations. The five countries that have previously made credit payments are Great Britain, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, and Lithuania. (10th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department stated today that the act of debtor nations repaying a portion of their war debts to demonstrate creditworthiness still constitutes a default and is subject to the Johnson Act, which prohibits lending. However, credit payments may still be accepted to avoid complete cessation of payments. The US government's views on war debts will be further detailed in President Roosevelt's message to Congress. An early resumption of war debt talks between Great Britain and the United States could break the deadlock. State Department officials anticipate that British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay will soon visit the State Department to discuss the matter. A few days ago, Attorney General Cummings stated that Great Britain, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, and Lithuania are not considered in default under the Johnson Act because they have paid a portion of their debt to the United States as a sign of creditworthiness. This statement has been met with mixed reactions in Congress, with some deeming it invalid and others supporting it. Diplomatic circles believe that the Justice Department's ruling is very beneficial to Great Britain because it could reopen war debt negotiations. It was later heard that President Roosevelt would state in his message to Congress that he would no longer accept credit payments. However, today, the State Department said that credit payments may still be accepted. In short, the US government's attitude will be seen in the President's message to Congress. According to Reuters, British newspapers criticized President Roosevelt's views on war debts, saying that European debtor nations do not see any possibility of repaying the United States several million dollars in war debts. The Daily Express even stated in today's editorial that President Roosevelt should know that Britain will no longer repay war debts. (10th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council of Ministers discussed the French war debt to the United States this morning. The discussion was initiated by Foreign Minister Barthou, who submitted a report by French Ambassador to the United States de Laboulaye regarding the scope of the Johnson Act and the interpretation of US Attorney General Cummings for cabinet study. Barthou is scheduled to go to Geneva on Sunday to attend the League of Nations Council meeting. The war debt issue will be thoroughly studied again after Barthou returns from Geneva, when the Council of Ministers will hold another meeting. Furthermore, the Saar region plebiscite issue is one of the agenda items for the current session of the League of Nations Council. Barthou today specifically explained the French delegation's position. It is reported that Barthou will request various safeguards in Geneva from the League of Nations Council to hold the plebiscite in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles.

<h3>US Actively Planning Transatlantic Air Route</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States is currently preparing a transatlantic air route plan, with a scale no less than the long-distance air route traversing South America. Fearing that aviators from France, Germany, Britain, and other countries will preempt them, they are sparing no effort to promote this plan. American aircraft magnates are negotiating routes with foreign countries while accelerating the construction of powerful seaplanes domestically. Explorers and climate experts are busy surveying in the rarely visited regions of Greenland. Another air route is planned via Bermuda to Southern Europe and is also under negotiation and surveying. As for American aviation power, it has extended to 33 countries. Six large transatlantic seaplanes have been completed and are beginning practice flights in preparation for the transatlantic air route linking Europe and the Americas to operate on a regular schedule once opened. These seaplanes can carry 32 passengers and 1,000 pounds of mail. (10th National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Meeting Imminent: Eastern European Five Nations to Act in Unison, Balkan Entente Closely United</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is heard today that the foreign ministers of the five Eastern European countries, namely Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, will come here to attend the League of Nations Council meeting. This indicates that behind the scenes of the League of Nations meeting, the Balkan countries will have an important development toward closer unity. Most Balkan countries are not members of the League of Nations Council, and the Turkish Foreign Minister and the Polish Foreign Minister have just formally reported to the Romanian capital. All of this is noteworthy. This significant diplomatic activity seems to indicate that the close unity between the Balkans and the Little Entente countries is currently under consideration.

<h3>Russia Loses a Revolutionary Veteran: Chief of Secret Police Dies</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a notice stating that Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, head of the secret police (OGPU), has passed away. Menzhinsky was one of the most prominent representatives of the old Bolshevik guard, an uncompromising revolutionary fighter, a great organizer, and a leader in the struggle against counter-revolutionary forces. He was born on September 1, 1874, the son of a teacher, and received legal education. He joined the revolutionary movement at a young age and was an active member of the Bolshevik organization.

<h3>Russo-Japanese Fisheries Negotiations: Ruble Exchange Rate Issue Resolved</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is now believed that the issues between Russia and Japan regarding fishing grounds and the ruble exchange rate have been effectively resolved. This is the result of today's discussions between the Japanese Foreign Minister and the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan. Soviet Russia has accepted Japan's proposal to begin negotiations on the ruble exchange rate and no longer insists on raising the exchange rate. It has also agreed to soon re-auction 47 fishing grounds. It is heard that Soviet Russia does not want to compete for 42 of them. The auction dispute arose on February 20 of this year, when Japanese people bid for certain fishing grounds in Vladivostok. Subsequently, they received a notice from the authorities stating that their bids, based on an exchange rate of 2.5 sen of Japanese gold per ruble, should be considered invalid because the exchange rate set by the Soviet Russian government was 7.5 jiao. Japan pointed out that Soviet Russia's auction unilaterally violated the provisional agreement signed in April 1931 by Kijūrō Shidehara and Troyanovsky and protested to Moscow. (11th Reuters)</p>

<h3>American Industrial Recovery and Diplomacy New York Correspondence: Political Trends Shift with the Economy; Diplomacy is Powerless to Help Other Countries</h3>
<p>American political action as a whole is focused on the Blue Eagle movement and the so-called "New Deal" policy. The actual content is about the same as before. In order to revive its domestic market, the US government spends 39 million US dollars every day, of which 19 million is lost and unrecoverable. Therefore, some people mock President Roosevelt, saying that he is a drunken sailor who only wants to spend money and has no other function. In fact, this kind of comment is also superficial and only recognizes one side of the actual situation in the United States. This side is the imbalance between agricultural and industrial development. Industrial manufactured products have increased due to the reduction in currency value and the stimulation of recovery, but agricultural products such as wheat have risen very little. However, looking at the entire US economic situation, there has been some progress, especially in the industrial sector. Now, according to a survey by the New York Times, based on the business activity index, assuming that its normal state is equal to 100, the amount of freight transportation on January 6 this year was 66.0, on February 10 it was 65.1, and on March 17 it was 69.4. Steel manufacturing in January this year was 53.0, in February it was 52.9, and in March it rose to 74.2. The amount of electricity production in January was 94.0, in February it was 93.2, and in March it was 95.2. The amount of automobile production in January was 41.0, in February it was 74.9, and in March it was 77.2. Its composite index rose from 78.6 on January 6 this year to 84.8 on March 17. This figure is indeed not as good as 99.0 in the summer of last year, but in terms of individual industrial sectors, such as the amount of freight transportation and the amount of automobile manufacturing, they are slightly higher than last year. Although the number of freight cars decreased from 604,137 on February 3 to 557,900 on April 7, this is a seasonal relationship. Because winter is over and summer is coming, the amount of coal used by the general public has decreased, so the number of freight cars has also decreased accordingly. We can see that electricity production, which is closely related to various industrial sectors and is also the most sensitive, increased from 1,636,000 kilowatt-hours in early February to 1,666,000 kilowatt-hours at the end of March. Furthermore, the amount of steel production is also sufficient to measure the situation of the US market. According to the figures released by the American Iron and Steel Association, the rate of steel production operations of all factories was 37.5% in early February, rose to 47.7% in early March, gradually decreased, and recently rose to 50.3%. The actual production numbers were 1,620,000 tons of pig iron produced in mid-March, an increase of 356,000 tons compared to the previous month. 2,797,000 tons of steel were produced in the same month, an increase of 572,000 tons compared to the previous month. In the first three months of this year, the total increase compared to the same period last year was 140% for pig iron and 131% for steel.</p>
<p>We all know that the United States is a car country and produces the most cars in the world. In January of this year, more than 160,700 cars were produced, in February more than 235,000 cars were produced, in March about 323,000 cars could be produced, and in April it is feared that it will approach 400,000 cars. Furthermore, the automobile industry has the most relationships with other sectors, such as the rubber industry, more than 80% of which is tied to the automobile industry. The volatile oil industry is also the same. Secondly, such as glass plates, nickel, aluminum, copper, and iron, and even copper, lead, hardwood, etc., are closely related to the automobile industry. Their future is determined by the prosperity or decline of the automobile industry. Therefore, the important position of the automobile industry can be inferred. Therefore, the general public is paying attention to this. Workers in automobile factories are even singing everywhere about the 36-hour work week and demanding a 20% wage increase. Not long ago, a national general strike was brewed, but it was fortunately quelled by the mediation of the President. But after all, it is only a temporary state. It is difficult to guarantee when it will break out again. What's more, labor unrest continues to exist and is brewing in the industrial areas of the United States. Therefore, the Roosevelt government is still seriously on guard. Given this tense domestic situation in the United States, the government is stepping up its guard for economic recovery. In terms of diplomacy, it is not only listed as secondary, but it also takes strength--economic strength--as the basis for determining its means of response. Although she still supports the open door policy, she is powerless to help others. (April 8th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui Troops Encircle and Suppress Fang Zhimin's Band of Red Bandits. Red Bandit Fortifications are Destroyed One After Another. Hengfeng and Geyuan Can Be Taken Soon.</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Fang Zhimin's band of Red Bandits in northeastern Jiangxi is being surrounded and suppressed by large forces from the three provinces of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The guerrilla tactics of advancing when we retreat and retreating when we advance, which were used in previous suppressions, are now completely inapplicable. The national army is advancing steadily, encircling and blocking, and has repeatedly achieved remarkable results. Therefore, the bandits are desperately building fortifications around Hengfeng and Geyuan, their base areas, and near the national army's positions, hoping to hold out. However, the troops of Yu Jishi have defeated the bandits in the areas north of Yushan, Shangrao, and Hengfeng, and the troops of Chen Diaoyuan in the north are also advancing on Hengbei from Dexing. The troops of Zhao Guantao in the south are also advancing north from Hekou and reached Laoyajian in Hengshu on the 25th of last month. There, the bandits' bogus 10th Army 83rd Regiment and bogus Independent Battalion had built solid bunkers in a dangerous location. Liang, the division commander of Zhao's troops, personally supervised the attack despite the rain. That day, there was heavy rain and dense fog. To avoid being ambushed, he first bombarded with artillery and then charged with infantry. At noon, he destroyed the bandits' earthen city outer trenches and approached the bunkers. Regiment Commander Zhang and Battalion Commander Wang supervised their troops to climb the bunkers and then broke through the bandits' bunkers. The bogus 83rd Regiment and bogus Independent Battalion guarding the bunkers were completely wiped out. Furthermore, after a certain division advancing west from Shangrao recovered Yangmei Mountain and Xiangu Mountain, people from the bandit area fled to Hekou and Shangrao in an endless stream. The division then advanced to Lengshui Keng, Diling Tou, Shengjia Fang, and other places in Hengshu. The bandit Fang once personally led the bandit masses to meet and resist, and there was a major battle in Longjing Wan. After the bandits were defeated and retreated, 400 bandit corpses were left on the battlefield. The above are all situations from the last ten days of last month. At the beginning of this month, the various armies have already advanced to the vicinity of Hengfeng and other places. According to news from the front, the national army recently captured Lianhe. The bandits' bogus Independent Battalion fled to Dayuan Wangjia, more than ten miles away in Huangsha Gang, with a total of 400 bandits and 300 guns, and are building fortifications. The bogus 10th Army fled to Huangteng Bridge south of Hengfeng County, the bogus 58th Regiment fled to the junction of Guixi and Qianshan, and the bogus Independent Regiment 59th Regiment fled back to the Zixi Shilong area at the junction of Qianshan and Chong'an in Fujian Province. The bogus 31st Division is composed of the old and weak who were forcibly conscripted from the bandit area and is being trained in the bogus Geyuan Province in northern Hengfeng. It cannot fight. In Shan Yali on the left wing of Geyuan, there is an arsenal that can only make earthen cannons. The bandit Fang was once injured and treated in the ninth district of Yiyang. The internal situation is extremely panicked. Bogus battalion commanders and below all want to surrender, but they have no chance. (May 8th)</p>
<h3>Huainan Railway Construction Begins: Passing Through Hefei and Chaoxian to Wuhu Across the River</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication: The Huainan coal mine, exploited by the Construction Committee, has a vast mining area, abundant production, and excellent quality. The number of miners is no less than 20,000, producing six to seven hundred tons per day. Sales are widespread in the Yangtze River area, and most factories and ships in Wuhu also use it. However, the mining area is located in Jiulonggang and other places on the south bank of the Huai River, and inland transportation is inconvenient, making it extremely difficult to transport and sell to the Yangtze River. Therefore, the Huainan Railway is planned to be built, with the route starting from the mining area, passing through Hefei and Chaoxian, and reaching Yuxikou across the river from Wuhu. The design has already been finalized, and the entire line will be constructed in three sections for speed. The first section is from the mining area to Hefei, the second section is from Hefei to Chaoxian, and the third section is from Chaoxian to Yuxikou. The first section of the project has already started. Twelve hand-operated flatcars have recently been purchased in Wuhu for the use of working personnel to travel back and forth. (10th)</p>
<h3>Catastrophic Defeat of Guangdong Silk Industry: Over 300 Silk Factories Closed in Shunde County, Losses of Tens of Millions of Dollars, Rural Economy Bankrupt, 200,000 Unemployed Female Workers, Most Emigrate</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Shunde County's silk has always been a major export commodity of Guangdong Province. Silk factories are everywhere in the county, and there are many workers. Farmers have been engaged in sericulture for generations, and their families are well-off. The economic independence of their women is even the best in the province. However, in recent years, the Shunde silk industry has been affected by economic decline, and it has gradually declined from its heyday. Exports are scarce, resulting in the bankruptcy of the rural economy. According to statistics, Shunde County had 328 silk factories at its peak in 1925, but only eleven can maintain their business today. These few surviving silk factories are only supporting themselves for the time being by storing old silk. If the stored silk is sold out, it is still unknown whether they can continue to operate. However, according to statistics on the capital losses of the closed silk factories, it is already more than 18 million yuan. When the silk industry was prosperous, Shunde's financial activity was second to none in the province. During the annual silk transaction season, an average of 300,000 yuan was transported from Guangzhou to various parts of Shunde every day. This huge sum was the price paid by foreign merchants for ordering silk. The county had a monthly flow of cash of up to ten million yuan, circulating among each other. Not only did silk merchants make huge profits, but also hundreds of silver houses in Daliang, Chencun, Rongqi, Leliu, Shuiteng, and other places, specializing in remittance and mortgage businesses, benefited from the financial circulation. Recently, due to the sharp decline in silk exports, financial irregularities, and about seven out of ten silver houses have closed down accordingly. Since there is no market for silk and silk prices have plummeted, some families still raise silkworms, but the price they sell silk is less than one-tenth of the previous value, resulting in unbearable losses. In the past, the price of mulberry was ten yuan or five or six yuan per hundred catties, but now, because there is no market, it is only six or four corners per hundred catties. The income from mulberry is not enough to cover the labor cost. The county has more than 6,000 hectares of mulberry fields, producing more than ten dan of mulberry leaves per mu (100 catties per dan). Calculated at the current value, farmers have lost 30 million yuan. Currently, mulberry fields have been converted to planting miscellaneous grains, and mulberry gardens are completely bankrupt. Farmers in Shunde County account for half of the population, about 500,000, and there are about 270,000 female silk workers. Recently, due to the closure of silk factories and the abandonment of mulberry gardens, no less than 200,000 female workers have suddenly lost their jobs. These unemployed female workers are displaced and mostly go to cities to work as laborers. Recently, Nanyang has been recruiting female workers, and these women have turned to overseas. According to Hong Kong statistics, an average of two to three thousand female workers go to Singapore from Hong Kong every month. (May 4th)</p>
<h3>Qingdao to Prepare for the Establishment of a Marine Biological Research Institute, Initiated by Zhang Xi, Director of the Peking Research Institute, and Others, and Drafted 14 Articles of the Research Institute's Regulations</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Zhang Xi, Director of the Peking Research Institute, Zeng Shengzhi, Professor of Shandong University, Jiang Bingran, Director of the Qingdao Observatory, Chen Zhen of Tsinghua University, Liu Chongyue of the Chinese Marine Biological Society, and five other biological experts believe that Qingdao has a mild climate and abundant aquatic products, is the center of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea fisheries, and has convenient land and water transportation, making it the most suitable place for researching marine organisms. Since the establishment of National Shandong University, it has spared no effort in the research and development of marine biology. However, it is not easy to concentrate talents, and teaching should seek more assistance. It is now planned to open the laboratory during the summer vacation period of various universities and research institutions to meet the needs of biological and aquatic experts from home and abroad to come to Qingdao for research. Moreover, the Qingdao Observatory Aquarium has relatively complete equipment, which is extremely convenient for mutual learning and observation. However, Shandong University's funding is stretched, and it is difficult to create independently. Therefore, it has jointly organized various universities and biological research institutions in the country to achieve this grand event. The drafted regulations and budget of the research institute are recorded below. "Regulations" 1. This institute is jointly organized by various universities and research institutions in the country to provide convenience for biologists to study and lecture on marine organisms. 2. This institute is located in Qingdao National Shandong University, and research rooms are also set up in the Qingdao Aquarium. 3. This institute has a committee, which is organized by one person sent by each university's biology department and research institution participating in it. 4. This institute has one director, who is elected by the committee. 5. The work of this institute is as follows: A.

<h3>Songjiang: Bribery Case of Supervisory Official Judged</h3>
<p>Yang Shaoxian, a former supervisory official of the Public Security Bureau, was ordered to go to Wang's in Zhalin at the end of last year to investigate a robbery case. Relying on his duties, he accused the victim of smoking opium and took the opportunity to demand bribes from the victim. After being robbed, the victim had no cash at home and hired a boat to borrow from relatives and friends. The supervisory official suddenly thought of smoking opium in the boat and ordered the boatman Wang Xiaotao to buy it. When passing through the territory of Fengxian County, he was seized by the Fengyi police and escorted to the county. Then, this county prepared a document to welcome and bring him back for interrogation by the county court. Now, after repeated trials by the criminal court of the court, the facts have been clarified. On the afternoon of the 10th, a proposal was announced and the defendant Yang Shaoxian was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for the crime of using his position to solicit bribes, and fined 200 yuan for smoking opium, to be executed concurrently.

<h3>Senior Merchants in the West Market Rice Industry Telegraph to Order the County to Open the Dam Immediately</h3>

However, it is heard that the dam built in the west section has not been opened for a long time, resulting in dirty and smelly river water, which is harmful to hygiene. Now, Zhang Ruoshui and others, chairman of the Rice Industry Board of Directors, have telegraphed to Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government, Director Yu of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Director Shen of the Department of Construction, requesting that the county government be ordered to open the undredged dam immediately to avoid disputes.

How she died was unknown. The question officer asked when the militiamen were drilling and when the deceased died. They replied that they were drilling at 3 pm and the deceased died at about 2 pm. The questioning officer believed that Qian Jingshan and others claimed that Zheng had died when they returned from the drill, which was completely an excuse. When it came to rebuttal, after the questioning, he ordered the family of the deceased to collect the body because her old aunt and eldest daughter were unwilling. The body was collected by Deputy Township Chief Li Zhuan, waiting for her husband to return to Cheng from Kunshan to deal with it. Judge Shi Cheng and others returned to the city in the evening.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: The Gu-Li Case Will Be Tried Soon</h3>

Later, Li Shuyun delayed and obtained Shanghai lawyer Chao Kun, who prepared a counterclaim against Gu Renfa, accusing him of bigamy and other circumstances.

Li Shuyun went to Xifu to formally file a complaint in two parts. The Wuxi Court has sent a letter of summons to the Zhenjiang Court Procuratorate for the accusation part, entrusting it to send Gu Renfa to the case, which is scheduled to be investigated at 1 pm on the 12th.

From the 8th, they still followed the previous practice, jointly divided shifts and ran.</p>
<h3>Jiashan Economic Oppression Leads to Three Suicides</h3>
<p>This county has always been known as a prosperous land. In recent years, commerce has drastically declined, and the rural economy has become extremely bankrupt. As a result, incidents of people committing suicide due to economic oppression have been occurring daily. For example, on the 9th, in the southern section of Fish Bridge in the town, a child bride named Xiao Bao, disliking the difficult life and constantly quarreling with her aunt, hanged herself. Also, a woman surnamed Wang from Yangmiao Town, who married a man surnamed Yao in Jiaxing, was left destitute after her husband's death. On the 11th, she committed suicide by taking poison. Yu Liqing, who ran a sundry stall in Youdonggang Town, had a mother and wife. He fell ill last year and was burdened with debt. Taking advantage of his family's unpreparedness, he hanged himself. Funds for his coffin and burial were entirely donated by philanthropists. His elderly mother and widowed wife, fearing they would not be able to survive in the future, also plan to follow him to the underworld. The tragic economic situation in this county can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou New Cocoons from Various Counties in Zhejiang Province to be Marketed</h3>
<p>The silkworm rearing season in Zhejiang Province has been affected by the frequent changes in weather, such as cold spells, warm spells, sunny days, and rainy days. The results of native silkworm breeds are not ideal. However, improved breeds are hatching later, and their physical condition is stronger. Especially in counties such as Xiao, Shao, Hang, Sheng, Wuxing, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Haining, Lin'an, Changxing, Wukang, Fuyang, and Zhuji, where model improvements have been implemented, sufficient disinfection and rational artificial hatching, joint rearing of young silkworms, and widespread guidance have been provided. Therefore, human effort has been able to compensate for the shortcomings of nature. According to a survey by the Construction Department, the early batches in various districts have already completed their fourth molt, and those with later leafing are also around their third molt. The overall progress has been good. New cocoons will be available for sale after the 20th of this month. It is estimated that 600,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs were distributed to various districts during the spring season. With unified breeds, there will be a significant harvest. Furthermore, after the amendment of the Zhejiang Province Management Regulations for Collecting Cocoons and Controlling Cocoon Dealers, all parties are satisfied. Cocoon merchants have been registering with the Construction Department. However, the silk market has not shown any improvement recently. In the future, the price of cocoons may only be around twenty cents per catty.</p>

The trial is scheduled to be held in late this month.</p>

<h3>Hu Yunzhuang Injured in Horse Fall in Lanzhou Flew to Shanghai Yesterday Dr. Niu Huilin Consulted Recovery Expected in Four to Five Weeks</h3>
<p>Hu Yunzhuang, manager of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, was unfortunately injured in a horse fall in Lanzhou on the 6th while accompanying Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the Economic Commission, on an inspection tour of the Northwest. He suffered a fracture in his right leg. Because there were no orthopedic doctors in the area, he originally planned to return to Shanghai for treatment on the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 2 plane chartered by Song. However, the No. 2 plane's engine was damaged in Lanzhou, so he changed to Eurasia's No. 3 plane the day before yesterday to leave Lanzhou for Shanghai.

<h3>White Russian Fascist Leader Busheski Arrives in Shanghai Attempts to Rally Exiles Liaise with Japan and Germany Build a New Russia</h3>
<p>According to a foreign news agency report from this city, the Russian Fascist Party is now in Manchuria, working with White Russians to organize the Manchuria Friendly Department. The leader of the party is Busheski. Mr. Busheski is very active in Manchuria. He suddenly arrived in Shanghai secretly on the Qingdao Maru yesterday. As soon as the ship docked, Mr. Busheski took a car to the Cathay Hotel and had a secret conversation with influential White Russians in Shanghai. Mr. Busheski was originally a wealthy nobleman who was exiled by the Communist Party and fled to the United States. During his exile, he learned of the suffering of the exiled White Russians. Therefore, he is engaged in this covert activity. Accompanying him on this trip to Shanghai are his wife and three secretaries, including Carter. His mission in Shanghai is to unite the White Russians in Shanghai and to coordinate with Harbin. At the Cathay Hotel, Mr. Busheski used his silver tongue to persuade influential White Russians, saying that we should unite. There are hundreds of thousands of us exiles, displaced and living a tragic life. No one is worse off than us. We may be mediocre, but if we unite and fight, organize a Fascist party, and build a new Russia, our party currently has more than 20,000 people in Manchuria. Combining with compatriots residing in China and Japan, our strength is great and can be expected. However, the new strategy of our movement should be to unite with Japan and Germany.</p>
<h3>Japanese Attention to the Lytton Report Shanghai Consulate Seeks Full Text from Our Side But Neither Foreign Office nor Agency Have Copies</h3>
<p>Before Mr. Lytton, the League of Nations' representative for technical cooperation in China, left China to return to Europe, he compiled a report on his work in China and submitted it to the League of Nations. A copy was kept by the National Economic Council. This report was published simultaneously in Nanjing and Geneva on the 10th. The Japanese are paying close attention to this. The Japanese consulate in Shanghai requested the full text of the Lytton Report from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Shanghai Office of the National Economic Council on the morning of the 11th for research purposes. However, neither the Foreign Office nor the agency had copies of the report.</p>
<h3>Osaka Daily News Again Reports Beijing Dispatch Saying Ministry of Foreign Affairs Prepares to Negotiate Whether this is Reliable is Worth Studying</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, although Tokyo newspapers reported a few days ago that Japanese Consul Suma had met with Foreign Minister Wang and proposed direct negotiations, which was officially denied by both our country and the Japanese embassy, ​​the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 5th again published a special dispatch from Nanjing stating that on the 4th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had notified Suma, the consul-general in Nanjing, that it was preparing to reopen negotiations. However, according to research by a Xin Sheng She reporter, the news may have been released by Suma. Whether it is reliable in fact is worth studying. In terms of the foreign affairs system, the counterpart of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the Japanese ambassador to China, and there is no reason to notify the consul-general.</p>

<h3>Coal and Coke Freight Temporarily Suspended Price Increase Ministry of Railways Approved Three-Month Extension</h3>
<p>Regarding the temporary suspension of the coal and coke freight price increase, the Ministry of Railways telegraphed the Lianglu Administration yesterday, saying that the temporary suspension of the coal and coke freight price increase on each route was extended to May 20.

<h3>Cotton Control Commission Requests Exemption from Yarn, Cloth Tax; Ministry of Finance Rejects as Impractical</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council's Cotton Control Commission, to alleviate difficulties in the yarn and cloth industry, had requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt it from business tax. News has arrived from Shanghai that the Ministry of Finance has rejected the request as impractical. The original response stated: "Regarding your commission's letter requesting a general order to all provinces and cities to exempt the yarn and cloth industry from business tax, which is currently under consideration, a subsequent letter was received from the Jinan Chengtong Textile Company stating that Japanese yarn merchants along the Jiaoji Railway are unaffected by business tax, severely impacting Chinese yarn. Please consider the previous letter concurrently." The Ministry notes its deep concern for the difficulties faced by domestic industries due to lagging production and business stagnation. Previously, a method was approved to exempt cotton raw material purchases by yarn factories from business tax, and orders were issued to all provinces and cities to comply. Subsequently, a letter was received from the Executive Yuan's secretariat, forwarding a request from the Shanghai Flour Mill Association to legally prohibit various provincial finance departments from collecting business tax from flour mills' branch offices. It was deemed feasible to exempt branch offices only engaged in sales and liaison from business tax. A clear explanation of this exemption was issued to provincial and municipal governments. Considering the foregoing, a blanket exemption for yarn and cloth business tax is practically unfeasible. Enclosed is document No. 4381 for your reference."</p>

<h3>Korean Red Ginseng Imports Surge, According to International Trade Bureau Statistics</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ji Zejin, director of the guidance department of the International Trade Bureau, stated that red ginseng has traditionally been the top import from Korea. After the September 18th Incident, the sales of Korean red ginseng plummeted. Mitsui Bussan Kaisha's red ginseng export trade nearly ceased, and the product piled up in the Kaesong production area. White ginseng production was increased for consumption by Japanese and Koreans, causing its price to plummet. Red ginseng was only exported in small quantities to Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and the Northeast. Although occasional imports occurred through Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai, the numbers were minimal. According to statistics from the Monopoly Bureau, Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, the export volume of Korean red ginseng in mid-March of last year was 590 catties (total for China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan). The total export volume last year was approximately 26,000 catties, of which China accounted for 1,470 catties. However, recent statistics show Korean red ginseng exports at 4,480 catties, a sharp increase of 3,961 catties compared to the same period last year. Of this, China accounts for 385 catties, Taiwan 600 catties, and Southeast Asia over 490 catties, demonstrating that China is the primary market for Korean red ginseng.</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Launches Two New Ships; Bottle-Breaking Ceremony Forgone Amid National Crisis; Completion Expected by End of Month</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs' newly built patrol ships, Wenxing and Yunxing, at the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Yard, have seen rapid progress since their keel laying last year. Due to the installation of the engines prior to the launch, the ceremony was delayed until 10:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included Chen Zaofan, deputy director of the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Yard, business director Yu Jianfu, statistics director Ye Fangzhe, security chief Ye Baoqi, representatives from Jianghai Customs, and officers from the First Fleet of the Navy.</p>
<h3>Launch Details</h3>
<p>Due to the national crisis, the traditional bottle-breaking ceremony was forgone as a cost-saving measure. During the launch, the Wenxing was first to enter the Huangpu River at high tide, completing the process in five minutes. The Yunxing followed suit. After the launch, two small vessels dispatched by the yard towed the patrol ships to the yard's wharf.</p>
<h3>Ship Specifications</h3>
<p>The patrol ships built by Jianghai Customs at the yard previously include Dexing, Lianxing, Hexing, Haiping, Haiyan, and Haian.

<h3>Sino-Foreign Relief Association Activities</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road, due to the impending reconstruction of its original premises at No. 12, has relocated its office to the fourth floor of the Zhongfu Bank at No. 907 across the street and is actively pursuing its established plans. New board members include Zhang Gongquan and Qin Runqing from the Chinese community, and A. Ahlers, B. Barnes, M. Ancel, and P. Bame from the foreign community. Zhang and Qin are leaders in the banking industry, while Ahlers, Barnes, Ancel, and Bame are well-known figures in Shanghai with a strong interest in Chinese relief efforts. The association's future prospects are expected to improve. A brief summary of their recent work is as follows:</p>
<p>The yellow fever-stricken areas and Hebei disaster areas have experienced renewed hardship due to the spring thaw and flooding. In addition to providing urgent relief to aid spring plowing, continuous support is being provided to orphanages in the Henan disaster area to avoid abandoning previous efforts. The temporary repairs made to the six major breaches in Gaoyou - Chengjunjunlou, Miaoxiangkou, Qibadian, Yumatou, Ershilipu, and Sanshilipu - using makeshift materials, were not a permanent solution. These are now being reconstructed with stone to a length of 1,522 feet and are expected to be completed this month. The government is being asked to inspect and take over responsibility, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of millions of people in the ten counties north of the Yangtze River, eliminating future risks of collapse.</p>
<p>The North Second and North Fifth branches of the Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi, constructed by the association, have been completed. Loans have been provided to farmers to dig more wells for irrigation. According to people from the province, the wheat crop is thriving this season, promising a bumper harvest and eliminating the worry of drought.</p>
<p>The Anqing Guangcheng Embankment, previously flooded, endangered farmers. The association is repairing the two major stone sluice gates, with the northern gate nearing completion. However, with rising tides, there are concerns that the southern gate may not be completed in time, and the work may have to be finished during the low water season in late autumn.</p>
<p>The association recognizes the urgent need to assist struggling rural communities and has decided to start in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with the aim of gradual expansion. The focus is on improving agriculture itself, promoting key aspects of cultivation, improving agricultural tools, and raising livestock, with the goal of revitalizing agriculture and promoting disaster prevention.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Urges Straw Hat Industry to Improve Products; Standardize Sizes and Styles to Compete in International Markets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Straw and Felt Hat Industry Association, stating: "We are forwarding a letter from Mr. Yu of Yongxing Foreign Firm, outlining a meeting to discuss various issues to promote the hat industry and achieve positive results. The industry is linked to the livelihood of millions of Chinese people, and unless careful improvements are made to meet foreign demand, the industry will inevitably decline sharply. Currently, most hat exporters face similar challenges, particularly the need to strictly adhere to required styles. Our firm has been operating in China for over 50 years, and we are a major hat buyer in Java and Italy, with branches in both locations. Our Paris headquarters holds a significant position in the industry and has access to accurate style reports. We propose to collaborate with major Chinese export firms and request the association's assistance in advising and encouraging local weavers to avoid misguided practices. We believe the straw hat industry in China has the potential for significant growth, provided that workers are willing to listen to advice and be compliant. If workers can produce perfect work, they will receive better compensation. The greatest difficulty is that hat-weaving villages are not fully meeting the needs of foreign hat buyers. We suggest that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or relevant foreign trade organizations send government personnel to promote awareness in rural villages, ensuring that buyers are satisfied. Neighboring Japan has made significant progress in its work and business practices over the past 30 years to gain a foothold in the market, serving as a precedent. If our export merchants can guarantee accurate sizes and styles, as Japanese merchants do, they will also be welcomed by buyers. We have sent a similar letter to the Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, hoping to promote the interests of China and the industry for positive results." An English copy of the letter is attached for your reference.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank Plans Shanghai Branch</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, to regulate rural finance and support rural production, established the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank in 1927. After seven or eight years of effort, it has accumulated over 3 million yuan in capital, 300,000 yuan in public reserve funds, and over 30 branch offices. Since Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department, also became General Manager last year, efforts to consolidate have been intensified. Chairman Chen Guofu recognizes the need to expand the bank. A recent decision was made to allocate an additional 700,000 yuan, which is expected to be paid in full soon. The bank's main businesses include managing warehouses, promoting rural production and marketing cooperatives, and supporting other agricultural organizations. In Jiangsu Province, there are currently over 60 warehouses and over 1,400 cooperatives, with deposits exceeding 4 million yuan and loans exceeding 3 million yuan. During this time of rural economic hardship, the 30 million farmers in Jiangsu see the bank as a savior. However, with so many farmers in need, the several million yuan in funds are insufficient to meet demand. The bank's authorities believe it is necessary to establish a branch in Shanghai, a center of capital and a financial hub, to balance rural and urban finance. To promote the sale of inland agricultural products in cities, the bank will attach a provincial agricultural product sales office to the Shanghai branch, which is currently being prepared. The branch has been located at 275 Minkuo Road, Xin Kaihe, and is scheduled to open on the 25th of this month. Wu Rencang, Deputy Manager of the head office, is in Shanghai actively preparing. It is rumored that after the interior is completed, the branch will actively liaise with the Shanghai financial community.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Opens New Exchange Offices in Nantong and Daishan</h3>

Daishan, in Zhejiang's Dinghai County, also uses the bank's banknotes extensively, so the bank has also established an exchange office there.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Denies Entrusting Japanese with Filming of Deceased Sun Yat-sen's Biography</h3>
<p>Following reports in the May 8th evening edition of the Japanese "Shanghai Daily" that Chiang Kai-shek had entrusted Japanese filmmaker Umeya Shokichi with the production of a film biography of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, which had attracted widespread attention, the "Electric Sound" film weekly in Nanjing Road, Shanghai, telegraphed Chairman Chiang's headquarters in Nanchang on the 9th for clarification. The magazine received a reply from Chiang yesterday, denying the story. This shows that there is no end to the Japanese's talent for fabrication. Chairman Chiang's original telegram read: "To the Nanjing Road Electric Sound Film Weekly, Shanghai: Received your telegram. Have heard nothing of Umeya Shokichi filming a biography of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, nor have I entrusted him with anything. Chiang Kai-shek, 10th [May], Secret, Ganzhou."</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Discusses Joint Operations on Beining and PingSui Railways; Hankou Road Extension Postponed; Zhou Fengtu to Tianjin for Negotiations</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's land-sea intermodal transport, since its collaboration with the Longhai Railway and Jiaoji Railway, has been profitable. However, the third proposed intermodal transport, with the Hankou Road, which involved adding tugboats and building temporary docks at Jiangan to handle intermodal freight, has been delayed due to difficulties in completing the construction, despite repeated consultations with the Railway Bureau. The implementation has been postponed to June. Zhou Fengtu, the intermodal transport specialist, intends to implement the Pingsui Railway and Beining Railway lines ahead of schedule to open up water-land connections in North China. Zhou telegraphed the directors of the Pingsui and Beining Railways and the director of transportation to discuss the possibility of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships picking up passengers and cargo from the two railways south of Tianjin or Tanggu, reducing shipping costs and simplifying procedures, benefiting both passengers and railways. This proposal was approved by the railway authorities. After Zhou concluded negotiations on the Hankou intermodal transport, he immediately traveled to Tianjin to discuss with the authorities of the Beining and Pingsui Railways the operational details for the south-bound rail transport of cargo via the two rail lines. It is reported that a draft of the intermodal transport agreement has been prepared by Zhou in consultation with the railway authorities and will soon be brought back to Shanghai for discussion, revision, and implementation.</p>
<h3>Jinglong to Salvage Cargo First</h3>
<p>The Hengkang Company's Jinglong vessel, grounded on a reef off Xiamen, is having its deck cargo unloaded by the Xiamen Customs Department. Yesterday, the company telegraphed to Xiamen for clarification on the earlier communication regarding cargo over the top deck in case of water rising which was "unclear". The company requested it to be clarified if the vessel's cargo could be salvaged, in case of waters rising over the deck. Information about the number of the vessel's compartments that may have a hole, was also unclear. The company also asked if there was a significant cost of vessel assistance being dispatched by Customs to salvage the cargo and save the vessel, and issued firm instructions to provide an answer for verification. The insurance office has to wait for the detailed message to reach Shanghai before determining whether or not to send staff to Xiamen. As for the cargo on board, undamaged goods would be salvaged. Passengers have also reported to the insurance company. Prior to vessel recovery, the company may order 84 crew members to leave Xiamen and return to Shanghai.</p>

He currently works in the parcel department, responsible for collecting and disbursing funds on behalf of customers.

<h3>Beacon of the Black Sea</h3>
<p>The harm of opium is universally known. Those addicted to it neglect their work, ruin their families, and even sell their wives and children to continue the habit. The smoke from cooking can be cut off, but the black smoke [of opium] cannot be absent. As a result, many sink into the lower classes and commit crimes. Such people are the dregs of the family, the waste of society, and the parasites of the nation. Recently, Chen Guofu, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, reported during a joint Party-Government memorial week that there are at least one or two hundred thousand opium smokers in the province. The actual number is likely several times higher. If this continues, the disaster of national destruction and racial extinction will be imminent. In fact, not only knowledgeable people deeply detest it, viewing it as a flood or ferocious beast, but also smokers themselves deeply feel the pain. However, perhaps due to physical weakness or financial constraints, they have not found a good way to quit for a while, and thus are immersed in a sea of suffering, unable to escape. It is truly lamentable. Now, fortunately, there is Dr. Lai Gongliang, who, based on his rich experience and precise research, has established the Tegong Jian Opium Addiction Hospital at 208 Baker Road (telephone 9512). He guarantees absolutely no pain and complete abstinence in the shortest period. Patients can also be cured at the same time. Furthermore, he aims to save people and charges very low fees. The poor are charged only for the cost of medicine. This is truly an excellent opportunity for wronged souls in the black registry to see the light of day again. Currently, the hospital is helping many people quit bad habits every day. Everyone praises Dr. Lai's benevolent heart and skillful art, which is said to be unique in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Tailor Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium—Ultimately Due to Economic Pressure—</h3>

At about 8 o'clock, someone discovered it and reported it to the police station. The head of the station immediately sent patrolman No. 68 to investigate. He was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital tried its best to perform an enema, but the poison was too deep. He died in the hospital at 10 o'clock that night. The hospital notified the police station to send the body to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road, and reported to the First Special District Court for an examination.</p>

<h3>Architectural Association Sends Representatives to Beiping to Observe and Seek to Develop Eastern Inherent Art</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Architectural Association, in view of the fact that modern architectural projects in our country tend to be Westernized, not only obliterating the inherent architectural art of the East, but also causing countless amounts of money to flow abroad each year for imported building materials, believes that improvements should be made to promote Eastern architectural art.

<h3>Red Pill King of Pudong, Clever Methods of the Honorable Girl, Trading Through Holes in the Bamboo Fence—Reputation Spread and Finally Cracked—</h3>
<p>The poisonous atmosphere of red pills permeates all of Shanghai. Although the police have repeatedly cracked down and investigated severely, they continue to rise and fall, and have never been completely eradicated. There is an old woman from Tongzhou, Jiang Zhu, who is nearly fifty years old, nicknamed "Honorable Girl." She has a daughter named Lin Ying, who is only fourteen years old. The mother and daughter live together at No. 2 Lane 90, Dongchang Road, Lan Nidu, Pudong, secretly establishing an agency for selling red pill drugs. Her sales methods are extremely secretive. It is said that buyers cannot directly go to her house to purchase red pills. Honorable Girl needs to tear a small hole in the bamboo fence near the bottom of Renji Lane behind her house as a place for transactions. Her daughter Lin Ying is in charge of all drug and money transactions. Therefore, those who are not experienced in this way cannot ask for help. The business is prosperous and the profits are abundant. However, it was soon noticed by outsiders, so the momentum became huge. Local people praised her as the "Red Pill King of Pudong." Recently, it was detected by Lu Ying, the chief of the third district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the detective team. He sent people to guard there every day. Sure enough, at about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, when the detectives and policemen were checking pedestrians at the intersection of Dongchang Road, they suddenly saw two middle-aged men coming in a hurry, looking suspicious. They immediately went forward to search and found a bag of red pills on them on the spot. After taking them to the district for questioning, they confessed that one was Zhu Helin, 33 years old, from Hankou, living at No. 38 Dongchang Lane, and the other was Gao Yuqing, 35 years old, from Yangzhou. The red pills were purchased from Honorable Girl at the above-mentioned location. Therefore, Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the district, and Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team, immediately ordered detectives and policemen to rush to the location to search. As a result, the daughter, Lin Ying, was arrested, along with thirteen bags of red pills, six silver dollars, and sixty-eight cents in small silver. Honorable Girl had happened to cross the river from Pudong to Shanghai and had not been arrested. The people and stolen goods were all escorted to the district. He continued to send detectives to wait near Honorable Girl's house until 5 o'clock yesterday morning, when Honorable Girl was seen returning from Pudong. She was arrested by the detectives and escorted to the district. After questioning, she confessed to selling red pill drugs without denial. Because it was related to selling drugs, the district prepared a document and sent the four criminals, the red pill queen Jiang Zhu and her daughter, Zhu Helin, Gao Yuqing, and others, along with the red pills, to the third section of the General Administration for legal action yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Japanese Consulate Cracked Down on Japanese Residents Taking Cuts from Gambling, Seven Gamblers Were All Reported, Taking Cuts as Travel Expenses for Returning Home</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the head of criminal affairs of the police station of the Japanese Consulate General, after discovering that there were gamblers on Haining Road, Detective Okumura investigated and reported seven gamblers, Niusao Maoji, Tongquan Shanjie, Xigu Tatsu no Jo, Hirano Yoshitaro, Ide Yasuchi, Kotani Iwo, and Matsumoto Nobu, all at once. The motive of the case was that Niusao was burdened by family affairs and wanted to return to his country, but he was troubled by travel expenses and could not set off. On February 14, he visited Matsumoto on Minhang Road and told him, "I am currently in financial difficulties. Is there any way to make money?" Matsumoto replied that he could invite friends to open gambling and take cuts. Niusao was very happy when he heard this idea, so he discussed it with Jianquan on Haining Road. He rented a building at Tongquan's house and persuaded five people, including Ihu, Xigu, Kotani, and Hirano. From 7 p.m. on February 14 to 7 a.m. the next day, they gambled with "four, five, six" dice at Tongquan's house, earning 280 yuan in head money. But Niusao only got 70 yuan. The winners on that day were very big. Xigu lost 1,830 yuan, Ide lost 200 yuan, Hirano won 890 yuan, Kotani won 800 yuan, Tongquan won 600 yuan, and Matsumoto won 300 yuan, but all were not in cash. They used business cards as paper money substitutes to keep accounts. Tongquan and Ihu, because Xigu lost too much, came out to mediate and ordered Xigu to pay 1,000 yuan, saying that 500 yuan would be paid to Kotani and the remaining 500 yuan would be distributed to Hirano and Matsumoto. Tongquan was willing to waive his rights, and the head money would be given to Xigu. Later, except for Matsuki, they gambled again at the original location on the 16th, earning 230 yuan in head money. However, because Xigu's debt was too large, it was difficult to pay it off. He went to Hirano's house on Wusong Road to invite friends to gamble. In total, he gambled three times and got 280 yuan in head money. Unexpectedly, the matter was known to the consulate, so the criminals were completely reported.</p>

<p>Shi Jixiang from Jiangbei, 45 years old, lived in a bungalow on Changping Road, Xiaoshadu Road, and worked for a living. At about 4 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, while walking near the Labor Hospital with his brother Shi Junyi and others, from south to north, a man suddenly rushed from behind and splashed nitric acid on Shi Jixiang's face and other places without asking any questions. Shi cried out in pain at that time and immediately fainted to the ground, unconscious. The man, seeing that his goal had been achieved, turned around and fled without a trace. Shi was sent to the Labor Hospital by his brother, but the treatment was ineffective. He died of his injuries the day before yesterday. The hospital reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate. The body was carried to the Forensic Examination Office on Fielun Road.

<h3>Chen Chunan Sued by Nephew for Property Invasion, Continued Trial, Must Summon Important Witness Chen Zifang to Court, Therefore, the Trial Is Extended for Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Chen Chunan, a wealthy Cantonese merchant living in Shanghai, lives at No. 16 Zhilanfang, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession. His grandfather had opened Chen Hefeng Tuhang in Shanghai during his lifetime and made a huge fortune. A year or two ago, Chen was sued by his younger brother Chen Xiangnan for inheriting the estate. Fortunately, it was resolved through the mediation of relatives and friends, and the lawsuit was settled. Unexpectedly, last autumn, Chen was suddenly sued by his nephew Chen Jiancheng in the Second Special District Court for encroaching on family property, and he filed a private lawsuit demanding one-quarter of the family property, totaling 2 million yuan. After several months of litigation, the verdict was that Chen Chunan was not guilty. However, Chen Jiancheng declared that he was dissatisfied and hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan and others to file an appeal with the High Branch Court. The court approved the motion and held the first hearing on the afternoon of April 29. In court, the plaintiff presented three reasons for the appeal, but the hearing was adjourned due to the absence of witnesses. The details were recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the retrial of this case. Judge Li Changnian presided over the hearing and summoned the plaintiff and defendant Chen Jiancheng Chen Chunan, each accompanied by their defense lawyers. However, Chen Zifang, an important witness in this case and a shareholder of Hefeng Tuhang at the time, was not present, and his address was unknown. However, the court stated that it was necessary to inquire about the situation of the joint venture and opening of Tuhang at that time, so it ordered him to be summoned to court to testify. Therefore, the court ordered the case to be extended for two weeks and ordered the plaintiff to instruct Chen Zifang to attend court in order to proceed with the trial.</p>

<h3>Patriotic Youth Zhang Guoxiang Threw a Bomb at Xinghua Restaurant, Originally Intending to Destroy the Facade of Jihua Restaurant, Because There Were Many People Entering and Exiting, He Waited for a Long Time Before Throwing It In, As a Result, Zhang Guoxiang Was Sentenced to Three Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang from Sichuan, 22 years old, joined the Volunteer Army to kill thieves for the country during the January 28th Shanghai War. When the war stopped, because the Japanese Kou invaded the Northeast, he rushed to the Northeast alone to cooperate with the Northeast Volunteer Army. When the Tanggu Agreement was concluded, he had no place to use his heroism, and after turning around, he returned to Shanghai. He made a living by shining shoes for others with Jiang Minsheng, a shoe-shining major general. At 8 p.m. the day before yesterday, he took a warning letter and a bomb wrapped in yellow paper to the door of Xinghua Restaurant. When he saw that people entering and leaving the restaurant were constantly coming and going, he was afraid that throwing it would hurt people, so he wandered outside the restaurant for about an hour. Later, because the number of people entering and leaving gradually decreased, he threw the letter and bomb together and ran away. Fortunately, the bomb did not explode, so nothing happened. Zhang ran to Shanxi Road and was finally intercepted by the night watchman No. 551 and the two Chinese constables Nos. 2876 and 1776, and taken to the Zhabei Police Station. After being questioned by the head of the police station, he was immediately detained. At that time, the police station had received a call from Xinghua Restaurant, and immediately sent detective Wang Jiaju to investigate and brought back the letter and bomb. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Qian Hongye interrogated him. After the police station lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, he presented Zhang's confession from the police station and requested that the case be handled in accordance with Article 318, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and Article 200 of the Criminal Law. When asked by the defendant Zhang Guoxiang, he admitted that he threw the bomb. As for the warning letter, he said that it was written by Zhou Kexiang. Zhou was a comrade of the Youth Aid to the Horse Group. He met him at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wuchang Road ten days ago. At that time, he went to Zhou's residence at No. 1059 North Sichuan Road. According to Zhou, he was instructed to find a bomb. It happened that I still had one bomb and placed it with Jiang Minsheng, so I took it and gave it to Zhou, originally intending to destroy the facade of his store. When he went last night, he saw that there were many people entering and leaving the store, which was inconvenient to do. He waited until about 1 a.m. and saw that no one was entering or leaving, so he threw the bomb and letter in. But the explosive power of this bomb is extremely weak, and even if it explodes, it can only cause slight injuries. Finally, lawyer Li argued that patriotic actions should have a scope and can be diligently reported through legal procedures. Now, they have suddenly used explosives, which not only damages people's rights and freedoms but also disrupts public order. He asked the court to investigate and handle it.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation of the Wang Deda case to maintain legal rights. The original text is as follows: "To the Public Security Bureau, (omitted above) We have investigated that merchants are free to buy and sell goods according to law. Even if Wang Deda's sesame oil store is considered to have purchased improperly sourced goods, real evidence should be pointed out to convince people. Now, based only on oral reports, account friends have been arrested and books and goods have been searched. The punishment is somewhat excessive. We request that your bureau investigate the details of the situation, and release the arrested account friends and return the searched books and goods first in order to maintain business. We are deeply grateful."</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the meeting began, Chairman Ni Baiyan delivered an opening speech, saying, "Since the establishment of this association, initiated by six groups including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, its intention was originally to promote domestic goods. Although we have loudly appealed and announced promotion, we have always been weak in strength and light in words, making it difficult to achieve practical results. I feel even more ashamed. My colleagues believe that the promotion of domestic goods must be deeply understood and purchased by the entire population in order to be effective. For this reason, this association has specially established temporary domestic goods markets in various districts based on the outline of work. After a long period of preparation and the enthusiastic participation of various factories, everything is almost ready. The opening is scheduled for the 14th. I still ask all sectors to give guidance in order to correct shortcomings." Then Huang Bingpei gave a speech, which is omitted.</p>
<h3>Decisions on Various Cases</h3>
<p>(1) Regarding the case of drawing lots for ordinary shop spaces and participating factory shop spaces, it was decided to draw lots on the spot.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the case of stipulating business hours for the commercial center, it was decided that the market would open at 8:00 AM and close at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the case of insurance for goods displayed by participating manufacturers, it was decided that the commercial center would negotiate with an insurance company, consolidate the insurance amounts required by each manufacturer, and jointly insure them. The amount of the premium would be distributed equally among the manufacturers based on the insured amount.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the case of manufacturers hanging flags at their shop spaces, it was decided that no factory would be allowed to hang flags in the corridors of the commercial center's public roads, but they could do so at their entrances as they pleased.</p>
<h3>Commercial Center Arrangement</h3>
<p>The commercial center is located at the original site of the St. George Dance Hall at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Yuyuan Road. No ceremony was held during the opening. Three electric light arches were erected at the main entrance of the tram station. The central arch had the words "Shanghai West District National Goods Temporary Commercial Center Sponsored by the Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee" in electric torches. One of the arches on each side had the words "Everyday National Goods, Everything You Need," and the other had "Exquisite Products, Dazzling Array." The shop spaces in the middle of the commercial center were for participating manufacturers, and the exhibition rooms were on both sides.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Inheritance After the Death of Famous Doctor Qin Heqi; Four Siblings Attack Each Other; Both Sides Attempt Reconciliation</h3>
<p>The late famous trauma doctor Qin Heqi of Chuansha was fond of women during his lifetime. In addition to his legal wife, Mrs. Gu, he also married Mrs. Zhang, and later took two concubines, Mrs. Chen and Mrs. Xia. In total, he had four concubines and eleven children. Mrs. Gu gave birth to two daughters, who were married off long ago, one to the Cai family and the other to the Zhang family. Mrs. Zhang gave birth to five children: Meifang, Lingou, Rulin, Dongxin, and Zhenkun. Mrs. Chen gave birth to three children: Zhisheng, Zhiying, and Cici. Mrs. Xia only gave birth to one son, Zhiren. Heqi, because he believed that his elder brother Helou had no descendants, adopted his eldest son, Meifang, as his brother's son. However, Meifang and his elder sister, Lingou, colluded with each other. Seeing that their father's concubines were constantly giving birth to children, they feared that the number of people sharing their father's inheritance would increase day by day. In previous years, they secretly took their father's hidden title deeds to real estate and mortgaged them to others without authorization. Heqi discovered this and accused Meifang of disobedience at the Chuansha County Government. Although the court ordered Meifang to return the deeds, he never complied with the judgment. However, Heqi, due to the father-son relationship, was unwilling to strictly pursue the matter. On April 26th of last year, Heqi passed away. Meifang and his sister Lingou again seized all the title deeds to the inherited houses, land, and fifty or sixty mu of farmland in Chuansha, disregarding the interests of their other siblings. At that time, Mrs. Chen and Mrs. Xia sued them in the First Special District Court for seizing the inheritance. Because the two daughters born to Heqi's legal wife, Mrs. Gu, were already married to the Cai and Zhang families, or were close to Meifang, they specially listed the two daughters and Meifang Lingou as defendants. At that time, Meifang was deeply afraid that once the court heard the case, each person would be summoned to court, and cross-examination would be unfavorable to him. Therefore, he immediately sought reconciliation with Mrs. Chen and Mrs. Xia. All negotiations were not discussed with the two sisters, Cai Qin and Zhang Qin, who were also defendants. Later, after a settlement was reached and a contract was signed, Cai Qin and Zhang Qin should have signed the contract, but Meifang Lingou fraudulently signed on their behalf. It was not until recently that the two sisters learned of this. They negotiated with Meifang and others, but failed to reach a satisfactory solution. Therefore, they hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Meifang Lingou, accusing the two defendants of encroaching on the inheritance and forging signatures, and requesting that they be investigated and dealt with according to law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Risheng heard the case in court. The four siblings appeared in court, attacking each other and refusing to yield. The affection between siblings was replaced by the hostility of enemies. After Judge Huang investigated the facts with both parties, he advised them to go outside and try to reconcile. The case was granted an extension for further deliberation.</p>
<h3>Using the Name of the New Life Movement; Jiangwan Welcomes Gods and Holds Temple Fairs; Ignorant People Do Not Know the Hatred of National Humiliation; Thousands of People Empty Alleys to Watch Liu San</h3>
<p>Since the City God Festival was held in this city, various towns in the urban area have also held activities to welcome gods and hold temple fairs. The authorities have repeatedly banned them, and the Ministry of Interior and the Central Civil Training Committee have also issued orders to various provinces and cities to correct bad folk customs, but all of them</p>
<h3>Tragic Murder on a Mahjong Table; A Fellow Mahjong Player Suddenly Opens Fire; Water Patrol Team Detective Captain Dies a Tragic Death; —One Suspect Arrested After Pursuit by Detectives—</h3>
<p>Zhu Zifan, a native of Pudong, was 32 years old. He previously served as the captain of the anti-smuggling team of the Water Patrol Team. He was very capable in his work. Last year, he solved many theft cases and killed a notorious bandit named Mao Muxiang. Therefore, he was highly valued by his superiors. This spring, he was transferred to the Pudong Nanhui County to serve as the captain of the detective team of the Water Patrol Team. Due to official business, he often crossed the Huangpu River to Shanghai. The Huibao Hotel at No. 13, Lane 369, Guangdong Road, was his usual residence. Yesterday morning, Zhu came to Shanghai again on official business. He arrived at the port at 2:00 PM and immediately went to Room 6 of the Huibin Hotel to rest. Feeling bored, he invited his friend, Mr. Xu, who worked at the Japanese-owned Longhe Foreign Firm, and two unfamiliar travelers in the hotel to play mahjong in the parlor. Around 7:00 PM in the afternoon, two more travelers resembling workers suddenly arrived at the hotel and checked in. One was wearing a black cloth shirt and pants, claiming to be named Wang Jinshan, and the other was wearing blue cloth shirt and pants, named Chen Jinshan. The hotel clerk led them to Room 23 upstairs to stay. Unexpectedly, the two stayed in the room for a moment and then went downstairs together to watch the game. They also observed the game from the sidelines, which was a common occurrence and did not attract attention. Before long, the mahjong game ended, and the two unfamiliar guests who had been playing with Zhu announced their retirement. Zhu and others, feeling unsatisfied, casually asked if anyone else wanted to join the game. The two men on the side immediately agreed and joined the game again. Unexpectedly, Zhu's luck was very good. A round had barely passed when the outcome was immediately visible. While they were shuffling the tiles, the two men sitting to Zhu's left and right suddenly stood up and reached into their pockets. They told Zhu to slowly arrange the tiles. Zhu thought they were taking out money, so he did not suspect anything. But in an instant, what appeared before his eyes were two guns, aimed at Zhu's head. Mr. Xu, who was sitting opposite Zhu, knew something was wrong when he saw this and quickly turned around and ran outside. At the same time, gunshots rang out in the parlor, three in total. Two hit Zhu's forehead, and one hit his right chest. Immediately, blood spurted out, brains flowed out, and he fell backward. The two murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, quickly ran out of the alley to escape. The hotel staff also quickly chased after them and saw the two murderers reach the alley entrance. They shouted loudly, "Robbery!" The Chinese constable guarding the alley heard the sound and saw the two men running towards Shilu Road in a panic. Knowing that they were the criminals, he also assisted in the pursuit. Fortunately, the constables on duty had already received the news. When they saw the two murderers running towards them, they immediately drew their guns and ordered them to stop. One of the murderers, seeing the opportunity, turned around and fled into a nearby alley. One murderer was captured alive by the constables on duty, and a gun with several bullets was found on his body. He was immediately escorted to the Laozha Police Station for detention. At the same time, detectives were dispatched to the scene of the incident to investigate, and the injured Zhu Zifan was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the injuries were fatal, and he died on the way. His body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination. The escaped murderer has been notified to all police agencies in the city to assist in the pursuit. As for the reason for Zhu Zifan's murder, it is said that it may be related to the killing of the notorious bandit Mao Muxiang. At the same time, whether the names and addresses filled in by the murderers at the hotel are their real names remains to be investigated. According to what they said, both are named Jinshan and both are 31 years old, which is quite suspicious.</p>
<h3>Demanding Money by Holding a Dead Child; Spilling Wash Water Causes Trouble; Why Continue to Harass After Compensation Has Been Paid?</h3>
<p>Mrs. Gu Wu, a woman from Pujiang, who lives at No. 118, Shengsheng Lane, Qianjiatang, French Concession, was washing her face on the morning of the [day left blank] of this month. When she poured the water out of the window, she accidentally splashed water on the four-year-old daughter, Baozhong, of Mrs. Zhang Liu, a Tianjin woman (named Wen [character left blank], 32 years old), who lives in the front parlor downstairs. The child seemed to be suffering from heat rash and was feeling unwell. Because the water splashed on her head, she was frightened and developed a fever and chills. The child's mother, Zhang Liu, shouted for people to call Gu Wu to a teahouse to reason. After the patrolmen learned of this, they detained the four hooligans who had been called by Liu to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, each was fined one dollar and released. These people still dared to invite Gu Wu to a nearby teahouse to reason. Gu Wu, knowing that she had been careless in pouring the water, admitted her oversight and agreed on the spot to compensate Liu with 21 dollars to be distributed to the hooligans to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, after Zhang Liu's daughter developed a fever and chills, she developed smallpox. Medical treatment was ineffective, and she died around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. Zhang Liu, grieving for her daughter, brought up the old matter again with Gu Wu, demanding that Gu Wu compensate her for the loss of the dead child. Wu refused to agree, saying that the matter had already been settled and should not be mentioned again. Zhang Liu, unable to obtain what she wanted from Wu, carried the child's body upstairs, intending to send it into [Mr.] Wu's room to extort money. Wu had foreseen Liu's malicious plan and had already locked the door tightly. Sure enough, Liu carried the child's body to the top of the building yesterday and placed it at the door of Wu's room, shouting for people to reason with Wu. At this point, Gu Wu, finding that there was no point in reasoning, reported the matter to the Foch Road Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and learned that Zhang Liu's daughter had indeed died of heat rash, which resembled smallpox. They also inquired about everything from the second landlord, Wei Wang, and carried the child's body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Coroner's Office to await an examination by the Second Special Court today.</p>
<p>difficult to effectively prohibit, which is deeply regrettable. Yesterday, an unprecedented Liu San Lord's Assembly was held in Jiangwan Town in the urban area. The Jiangwan Road was crowded with traffic, creating a very grand scene for a time. The parades from Shangtaijiabao and Nantong counties came to Shanghai to participate. The audience reached 500,000 people, which shows the grandeur of the event. Liu San Lord is Liu Bishi from Jiangwan, who was once a respected general. It is said that he had meritorious service in history, so the local people built a temple for him in Jiangwan Town, naming it the Three Lords Temple (also known as Dongyue Temple). This temple was dilapidated, and after the January 28th Incident, there was even less inside. However, a grand gathering must be held every year on March 28th. However, in past years, it was not approved due to the authorities' prohibition, so this year's assembly was even grander than in previous years. The assembly was held in the Dongyue Temple on Wan'an Road in the town. The temple was decorated with lanterns and colored ribbons. A white cloth banner was hung in the center of the temple, with the words "New Life Movement" written on it. The right side of the main hall of the temple had a statue of Liu San Lord, and there was a horizontal plaque with the words "Loyal and Manifest King." Incense was burning, and ordinary men and women were kneeling and worshiping. Along the way, people dressed up as strange and bizarre gods in different attitudes. At noon, the heads of associations from Jiadu, Zhabei, Danziwan, Gaolang Bridge, and other places gathered there. There were more than ten dragon lanterns, as well as ground-walking Beijing opera pavilions and other people dressed up as the 360 trades. There were men and women, as well as the ceremonial parades from Nantong and other counties that came to participate. At 3:00 PM, the parade officially began. The parade route went from Jiangwan Road to Yinxiang Road to Dachang and other places. The crowds along the way were packed and impenetrable. There was no place to park cars in Jiangwan Town. The assembly ended at 6:00 PM in the evening. It is said that a similar grand assembly will be held in Dachang on the first day of the abolished lunar calendar. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has strictly ordered the Baoshan County Government to effectively prohibit it.</p>
<h3>Corrupt Police Officer Sentenced; Seller of Red Pills Fined</h3>
<p>Bian Songlin from Yangzhou, together with Feng Liansheng from Wuxi, carried a leather suitcase containing four bags of red pills, totaling 4,000 pills, intending to transport them to the interior. On the morning of the 29th of last month, at around 8:00 AM, while passing the iron shed gate at the intersection of Xinqiao Street and Minguo Road in the French Concession, they were inspected and arrested by Patrolman Ni Lianxue, No. 426, of the French Police Station. Because Bian requested leniency and help, the patrolman took them to Yuan Shang Lane nearby and colluded with the gatekeeper patrolman of the lane, Liu Lianyuan, to demand 30 dollars from Bian for their release. Because Bian had no cash on hand, he borrowed money at home and managed to gather only 20 dollars. He entrusted Feng Liansheng's nephew, Lu Qiaogen, to send the money. Ni and Liu, because the amount of money was different from what they requested, refused to help. Ni then took Feng and Lu, along with the suitcase of red pills, to the police station. Later, the detectives continued to arrest Bian and seized a smoking pipe and four smoking needles in Bian's home. They were sent to the Special Court for interrogation and detention. During the investigation at the police station, Bian confessed that Ni and Liu had colluded to demand bribes. The police station arrested the two patrolmen and handed them over to the Special Court to be prosecuted for violating the anti-smoking law and the crime of dereliction of duty under the criminal law. After the trial was concluded by Judge Wang Gangxu, the date was set for sentencing. The circumstances have been recorded in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. The police station escorted the defendants to the court. Judge Wang took the seat in the Fifth Criminal Court and sentenced Bian Songlin to a fine of 300 dollars for possessing opium substitutes with the intention of using them for smoking. Feng Liansheng was sentenced to a fine of 40 dollars for assisting in possessing opium substitutes with the intention of using them for smoking. If the fines are commuted to imprisonment, each dollar will be converted into one day. Ni Lianxue was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for demanding bribes for conduct contrary to his duties. Liu Lianyuan was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for assisting in demanding bribes for conduct contrary to his duties. Before the judgment is final, the number of days of pre-trial detention will be used to offset the imprisonment, with two days offsetting one day of imprisonment, or one day offsetting two dollars of fine. The 4,000 red pills, one smoking pipe, and four smoking needles were confiscated and burned. Lu Qiaogen was found not guilty. During the appeal period, Bian Songlin paid a guarantee of 500 dollars or a shop guarantee. Feng Liansheng and Lu Qiaogen were still released on the original guarantee. Ni Lianxue requested to be released on bail, and the court allowed him to pay a 5,000-dollar shop guarantee to be summoned at any time and suspended his detention. Liu Lianyuan was detained in the detention center pending instructions.</p>

<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Overview of the Work of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration for the First Quarter of the 23rd Year (7)</h3>
<p>(Economizing on Consumption) The consumption of each station is primarily based on oil and electricity. Recently, practical economies have been implemented, which are expected to save approximately six thousand yuan annually. For example, Wuxi Station has added electrical lights where they were lacking, removed excessive ones, and installed switches as appropriate. In addition, switches were installed for all employee residences outside the station, and monthly electricity usage was limited. The station master of that station, Li Guisheng, designed to replace gasoline lamps with electric lights in the freight yards and at the east and west branch roads, saving considerable expense, and was immediately commended to encourage this.</p>
<p>Suzhou Station originally relied on its own power generation, with a total cost of one thousand four hundred and forty yuan per month. Recently, a commercial power plant has been supplying electricity day and night. After consultations, the station connected to the commercial power plant to receive an equivalent amount of electricity, estimated to cost seven hundred and forty yuan per month, saving seven hundred yuan compared to the previous arrangement, or eight thousand four hundred yuan annually.</p>
<p>The commercial electricity used by Kunshan Station was originally priced at 4.4 jiao per kilowatt-hour. However, for three months in winter, due to extended hours, an additional 3.6 jiao was charged per kilowatt-hour. Recently, an agreement was reached to cancel the winter surcharge. Starting this year, for the three winter months, the Administration will provide a fuel allowance of 30 yuan per month, for a period of two years.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of car services, there are plans to switch to domestically produced printing materials, self-repair ticket rolling machines, reduce stationery usage, make envelopes from waste paper, discontinue the use of gasoline lamps, and discontinue telephone lines that are not strictly needed. It is estimated that this will save more than ten thousand yuan annually.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding telegrams sent by various stations, some were not in line with the nature of telegraphing, while others described facts in excessive detail or were overly complex. This not only wasted electricity but also obstructed the lines. Therefore, measures were established to address this.

<p>(Cancellation of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road Rental Agreement) In November of the 19th year, this Administration leased 200 new 20-ton freight cars from the China Railway Vehicle Company for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, establishing a contract with 18 articles. In December of the 21st year, the Ministry of Railways ordered its cancellation. Starting in August of the 22nd year, under the guidance of Secretary Liu, dispatched by the Ministry, negotiations were conducted with the company. After eight meetings, it was decided that this Administration would purchase 23 of the company's already-equipped cars for a price of 59,800 yuan (equivalent to 2,600 national currency yuan per car). The Administration would also purchase the company's car parts at its discretion, cancel the original contract, and establish seven articles for subsequent arrangements. Subsequently, three additional meetings were held, and three additional articles were added as attachments to the subsequent arrangements. The parts were valued at 16,600 national currency yuan. Starting from January 15th of the 23rd year, the car price and parts will be paid to the company in installments.</p>
<p>(Recovery of Real Estate) The Hangzhou City Station Northeast Postal Bureau has approximately 15 mu of land in front of the road, which was previously leased by the Hangzhou Municipal Government to build City Station Park. Later, the open space south of the station was expanded by this Administration to create a park, which was adjacent to City Station Park. The Hangzhou Municipal Government then requested that the park be merged under the unified management of this Administration. Staff were dispatched to take over, and gardeners were transferred from the Jiaxing Nursery to manage it. Furthermore, the Asia Petroleum Company leased land along the railway in Zhabei to build a warehouse. Due to rent increases, the warehouse was sold to this Administration for 1,700 yuan. After repairs, it was divided into twelve rooms and allocated for use as accommodation for train crew members. (To be continued)</p>

Sincerely, Chairman of the 3rd Members' Meeting of the Anhui Students Association in Shanghai, Wang Kaimin, Hu Xiangwen, May 11th.</p>
<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>
<h3>Discussion on Issues of Esperanto Learning (1)</h3>
<p>We believe that the answer given by Mr. on April 28th to Mr. Xiong Zifo of Guangzhou regarding the issue of learning Esperanto is generally correct. However, after reading it, we feel that there are several points that still require supplementation and discussion. We will briefly state our humble opinions below for Mr. to correct. After strongly arguing for the necessity of learning Esperanto, Mr. also pointed out the fallacies of Esperanto's opponents. Opponents focus on the artificiality of Esperanto, ignoring the fact that the Esperanto movement is progressing. Therefore, Mr. says: "Understanding the Esperanto movement from the language itself will naturally not lead to correct conclusions." Yes, their fallacy lies on the one hand in ignoring the fact that the Esperanto movement matures along with the maturity of the entire new cultural movement, but the root of their opposition to "artificial language" lies in their use of the traditional idealistic linguistic perspective to measure Esperanto. Idealistic linguists attempt to seek the ultimate nature of language in a static state, resulting in the separation of language from social relations, treating it as a naturally occurring, isolated phenomenon. (Look! How fragmented they are in researching ancient sounds, infatuated with old bones, in order to escape reality!) They deny the "artificiality" of language, even denying the lawful development of language. But as Adam Smith said, "All languages are artificial." The emerging linguistics tells us that language is neither divinely bestowed nor naturally occurring, but is created by humans themselves in response to the needs of real life. The process of creating this language was not consciously realized by the humans who created it until humans began to use consciousness to control social life. Human language corresponds to the evolution of society and develops according to certain laws. Human society progresses from primitive tribal life to feudal society, to capitalist society, to socialist society: Language also correspondingly goes through the stages of primitive language, dialect, national language (national language), and finally, inevitably, world common language. Now is the era when capitalism is beginning to collapse. On the one hand, the languages of various nations have developed to the extreme, and at the same time, in the womb of capitalism, beside the national language, the embryo of the future social world common language has been conceived. But can capitalism complete the task of this world common language? It is absolutely impossible. This impossibility is determined by the contradictions of capitalism in the age of imperialism." And the future common language "will never be German, nor Great Russian, but completely another kind of language." This is the scientific basis of Esperanto in linguistics.</p>
<p>Naturally, the so-called "artificial" above, the so-called "artificiality of language," does not refer to the concoction of any individual, but rather to the collective creation of the masses who actually use this language. L. L. Zamenhof, the originator of Esperanto, said: "Individuals can only be originators, not creators," "I don't want to stipulate the entire vocabulary, I don't want to create the entire language from beginning to end according to my personal preferences," "everything else" should be created by human society and real life, just as we see in all natural languages." This is the best annotation of collective language creation. At that time, what Zamenhof gave to the masses was six articles of grammar and a limited vocabulary (only this point was created by Zamenhof's own hands and commonly followed by everyone as the "foundation of Esperanto"), and at the same time he declared the abandonment of all his personal privileges over this language, and entrusted this labor and its future growth entirely to the practical use of the masses. "Esperanto has no personal legislator, nor is it subordinate to any individual. All opinions and writings of the originator of Esperanto, like the opinions and writings of all other Esperantists, are of an absolutely private nature, and have no compulsory nature for anyone." Based on Zamenhof's wise and democratic principles, Esperanto is constantly collectively created by the international masses who actually use it (and are growing in size), gradually approaching perfection, and becoming the embryo of the future social common language.</p>
<p>Secondly, we believe that Mr.'s understanding of obtaining basic knowledge is too mechanical. A certain degree of basic knowledge is naturally necessary for new cultural movement activists. However, the path to obtaining this basic knowledge is not limited to mechanically reading a few books, but can have various different paths. Some people have entered this path from novels, while others have entered it from the screen or stage, and have begun to correctly understand the structure of this society. This is why literature, film, and theater, which have always been regarded as non-mass things, also have their full value and reason for existence in the field of mass cultural movement (of course, not to say that they are more noble than other departments, but also certainly not inferior). And if we know that the acquisition of basic knowledge should also be experienced and learned from real life, then why doesn't Esperanto, which can be used to penetrate into the real life of the international masses, have such value? Isn't Esperanto one of the good tools for acquiring basic knowledge? Here, it is very appropriate to quote the words of the Japanese Esperantist Akita Ujaku: "For all young men and women, I unconditionally recommend learning Esperanto. I am convinced that Esperanto is the gateway and guide for all young men and women to advance towards a correct worldview and a correct social view." (Luo Suofu Chen Jue Lai)</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting's Opening Speech Expresses Sincere Welcome to the Participation of the Dutch East Indies Hopes the Far Eastern Games Will Continue Its Loyalty and Cooperation Expresses Deep Gratitude for the Friendly Hospitality of the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper, Manila, 11th) Our country's chief representative Wang Zhengting's (today's) speech at the opening ceremony of the Games is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman of the Games, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am extremely delighted to represent the China National Amateur Athletic Federation and the Chinese delegation in extending congratulations to the 10th Far Eastern Games. At today's meeting, in addition to all the athletes from the original three member countries since the establishment of the Far Eastern Games in 1913, we also have the participation of the Dutch East Indies. We would like to express our deepest welcome to Dr. Brandes and his delegation. I must also congratulate President Quezon and all the staff of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation for the completion of the permanent sports field that they have been hoping to build for many years. Furthermore, I can inform everyone that the large sports field that we dreamed of in Shanghai is also about to be realized. Mayor Wu of Shanghai has found an excellent location, and the funds of over one million yuan have also been raised and will soon be used to start construction. Although we already have a magnificent sports field in the capital, Nanjing, we still eagerly hope for a large sports field in Shanghai, because we feel that Shanghai is better able to host a large number of athletes from various countries. The value of promoting international sports need not be reiterated. I firmly believe that all the member countries that founded this Far Eastern Games will continue their loyalty and cooperation to the end. Finally, on behalf of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, the Chinese delegation, and myself personally, I express my sincere gratitude to all the staff of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation and the people of the Philippines for the friendly hospitality they have shown us since our arrival in the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Games President Quezon</h3>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Broadcast Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 11th) The Philippine broadcasting station invited the chief representatives of each country to give speeches at 7:30 PM on the 11th. Our country's chief representative Wang Zhengting gave a speech in English, saying that this was our fourth time coming to the Philippines, and we were extremely pleased. These opportunities all come from the Far Eastern Games. Therefore, the Far Eastern Games can further increase international friendship. The Philippines has made rapid progress, and the goal of independence has been achieved, which is commendable. The construction of a permanent sports field this time is extremely admirable. China is making great efforts in sports. Last year, we held the National Games in Nanjing. Now we have decided to build a sports field in Shanghai to prepare for next year's National Games and the next Far Eastern Games. We hope that the Philippines will send a strong team to participate, and especially hope that the Far Eastern Games, which have been around for over 20 years, will continue to progress and not encounter obstacles. In his reply at the opening ceremony on the 12th, Wang will reiterate the same meaning.</p>
<h3>Philippine Governor General Hosts Officials and Athletes</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper, Manila, 11th) Philippine Governor General Murphy hosted officials and athletes from various countries today.

<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 11th) Philippine Governor Murphy hosted athletes from various countries at the Governor's Office from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 11th.

There was solemn music and exquisite refreshments, and everyone dispersed in joy.</p>
<h3>Today's Football Our Country Fights the Philippines Match Starts at 5:00 PM This Afternoon Our Country's Lineup Released The Championship of the Last Games Was Shared Equally by China and Japan</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 11th) The issue of replaying the football championship has not yet been resolved. The unresolved football championship from the 9th Games will be left to this Games. Also, due to lack of competition time, the football championship of this Games will be shared equally by China and Japan. The competition schedule for this Games has already been arranged. On the 12th, China will face the Philippines, with the match starting at 5:00 PM. Our country's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Jiliang, Li Tiansheng, Liu Mao, Li Guowei, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Ye Beihua, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Tan Jiangbai, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>(Japan Associated Press, Manila, 11th) China's favorite sport, football, will be played by China and the Philippines on the first day of the Games. Japanese football coach Takegoshi's predictions for the China-Japan-Philippines matches are as follows: In football, China and Japan are in an equal position, and the Philippine team is slightly weaker. For the time being, this seems to be a suitable prediction. The Chinese team has been superior in football training, but the Japanese side also needs to pre-plan a careful battle strategy, so the match should be outstanding, he said.</p>

<h3>China and Japan's Tennis Today Two Singles Matches Qiu Feihai Fights Sato Xu Chengji Meets Yamada Lin Wangsu Still Has Not Recovered and Is Difficult to Play</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper, Manila, 11th) The Far Eastern Games tennis championship is based on the Davis Cup competition method, with a total of two alternating singles and one doubles match. According to the Davis Cup method, the first singles meets the second singles, and the second singles meets the first singles. As a result of today's four-nation tennis coaches' meeting, it was passed that, for the sake of fairness, the order would be determined by drawing lots. The order of the China-Japan match is as follows:</p>
<p>12th Singles Qiu Feihai (China) vs. Sato Hyotaro (Japan)</p>
<p>Singles Xu Chengji (China) vs. Yamada (Japan)</p>
<p>13th Doubles Qiu Feihai, Xu Chengji (China) vs. Sato Hyotaro, Yamagishi (Japan)</p>
<p>14th Singles Qiu Feihai (China) vs. Yamada</p>
<p>Xu Chengji (China) vs. Sato Hyotaro</p>
<p>Today, the group of Qiu Feihai vs. Sato Hyotaro expressed great honor at the first tennis court. Lin Wangsu has still not recovered and is still difficult to play.</p>
<h3>Japan Fears Our Country</h3>
<p>(Japan Associated Press, Manila, 11th) Japanese tennis star Sato Hyotaro expressed his expectations as follows: The Filipinos have been practicing tennis under the scorching sun for a long time and are skilled, especially Gabia, who is considered the strongest player, but other than that, there is nothing to worry about. Although Chinese players such as Lin Baohua did not attend this time, Qiu Feihai, Xu Chengji, and Lin Wangsu have also been practicing in the heat and are our strong opponents. The skills of the Dutch East Indies players are unknown, but they are also tolerant of the heat. The outcome depends on whether the Japanese players can withstand the heat.</p>
<h3>Lineups of the Four Countries</h3>
<p>(Japan Associated Press, Manila, 11th) The order sheet for the tennis matches on the first and second days of the Far Eastern Games has been decided as follows:</p>
<p>(Singles) First Day</p>

<h3>Commemorative Stamps of the Games</h3>
<h3>Methods of Winning Championships — Women's Performances —</h3>
<p>The competition regulations for the nine championships of the Far Eastern Games are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Track and Field Events include high jump, long jump, triple jump, pole vault, 16-pound shot put, discus, javelin, a total of seven events. The top four in each event are awarded points based on 5-3-2-1.</p>
<p>(2) Track Events include 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, 800 meters, 1500 meters, 10,000 meters, 110 meters hurdles, and 400 meters hurdles, a total of eight events. The top four in each event are awarded points based on 5-3-2-1.</p>

<p>(4) Swimming includes 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle, 200-meter breaststroke, 100-meter backstroke, 400-meter freestyle, 1500-meter freestyle, and 200-meter relay. The top four in each event are awarded points. Except for the relay, which is calculated as 16-4-2, the rest are calculated as 5-3-2-1. Fancy diving is not scored and is for performance purposes only.</p>
<p>(5) Football adopts a single round-robin system, with each team playing each other once. The winner gets 2 points, a draw gets 1 point, and a loss gets 0 points. The team with the most points wins the championship. If the game is a draw, it will be extended for 15 minutes. If it is still a draw, our country advocates for a rematch, while Japan advocates splitting the championship. This issue has not yet been resolved. (6) Basketball adopts a double round-robin system, meaning each team must meet any opposing team twice. The winner is calculated based on percentage. If the scores are equal after the round-robin, a final will be held to determine the championship.</p>
<p>(7) Volleyball adopts a double round-robin system, meaning each team must meet any opposing team twice. The winner is calculated based on percentage. If the percentages are equal after the round-robin, a final will be held to determine the championship.</p>
<p>(8) Baseball adopts a double round-robin system, meaning each team must meet any opposing team twice. The winner is calculated based on percentage. If the percentages are equal after the round-robin, a final will be held to determine the championship.</p>
<p>(9) Tennis adopts the Davis Cup system, divided into four singles groups and one doubles group. Two singles players exchange matches once each with one player from the opposing team. Each group is best of five sets.</p>
<p>(10) Women's sports are all for performance purposes. This year there are only two events: tennis and volleyball. Our country has no hope in either. Volleyball is a round-robin system, and tennis is a Davis Cup system, but each group adopts the best of three sets.</p>
<h3>The Great Basketball Battle Between China and Japan Tonight: Equal Strength, Unknown Winner. Japan is Wary of Chinese and Philippine Players</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 11th) The athletes from various countries at this Peng Yuan Games are extremely elite and well-organized. According to general speculation, China can win the football championship, and the Dutch East Indies are not to be feared. In basketball, China and Japan will first engage in battle on the 12th (tonight). The three teams of China, Japan, and the Philippines are of equal strength, and it is unknown who will be the victor. China has the greatest hope in volleyball, while the Philippines and Japan will have a fierce fight in baseball. China is afraid that  Japan will undoubtedly control track and field and swimming. We can only hope to score points.</p>
<p>(Japanese United News Agency, Manila, 11th) Japanese basketball coach Mr. Kurosawa said to people as follows: Judging from the practice of the Philippine basketball team, it seems that their practice methods imitate Japan. However, the problem lies in their fast attacks. If Japan arranges a defensive formation, it will not be difficult to win. This is what Japanese players expect. However, what is most surprising is that since the 6th Far Eastern Games were held in Osaka, Philogano, Sancano, Sensslope, and Bernosula, who have participated five consecutive times, are still alive and very active. Chinese players also participated last time, and this time they are all taller, so they are not easy to deal with either. In basketball, China, Japan, and the Philippines are evenly matched, which is quite a spectacle of the Games.</p>
<h3>Evaluation of the Nine Championships: Our Country Has Great Hopes in Football, Volleyball, and Tennis; The Philippine Army is Confident in Basketball, and Baseball is Also Ambitious; Track and Field, All-Around, and Swimming Will Be Controlled by Japan</h3>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games, with athletes from China, Japan, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies gathering in the Philippines, is scheduled to open in Manila this afternoon at 2 PM. Since the abolition of the overall championship, the situation of each country has been concentrated under the individual championships, which will be described separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Football Championship: Our Country Has Very High Hopes; Java is a Strong Enemy; Japan and the Philippines Claim to be Equals</h3>
<p>First of all, in terms of football, the football championship was our country's exclusive possession before the 9th Games, except for the first Games, not allowing others to get involved. Since the last Games in Tokyo, when we drew with Japan, the Japanese ambition has since flourished. In terms of their technique, it is indeed better than in the past, but according to a special dispatch from five Japanese newspapers, our country's coach Huang Jiajun observed the Japanese team's practice and found that their technique is far inferior to our country's. Therefore, Japan's desire to win the football championship is a dream. And Java is our country's only strong enemy. Javanese players are accustomed to the tropics and have already gained a geographical advantage. However, it is rumored that five overseas Chinese players among them have said that they will not work for Java, with at most three of them doing so. If so, then our country has a firm grasp of the football championship. In addition, this time, generals Li Huitang and Feng Jingxiang are serving as forwards, and the offensive is stronger than in the previous Games, then the Japanese will be even less of a concern. As for the Philippines, gathering the essence of Manila and being the host team, its strength is actually not as weak as imagined.</p>
<h3>Tennis Championship: Success or Failure Depends on Doubles; China and Japan Have Equal Hopes</h3>
<p>This year's tennis championship, our country has the hope of restoring the glory of the 8th Games in 1928. Although Lin Baohua cannot go due to matters, Qiu Feihai, Xu Chengji, and Lin Wangsu are all the essence of our country. If they can eliminate Japan in the preliminary round, it is equivalent to winning the championship. Therefore, today's China-Japan tennis match is the final. Because the Javanese players have no one who can defeat Xu Chengji, and the Philippines relies entirely on Kavier alone. Although Kavier has improved, he is helpless in supporting a giant building with a single tree, and the hope is very slim. As for the situation between China and Japan, Sato Hyotaro and our country's Qiu Xu will have a fierce battle, and Yamada will definitely be able to win against Qiu Xu. If Qiu Xu's doubles can win, our country's championship is already in hand. The key to success or failure lies entirely in this.</p>
<h3>Volleyball Championship: China and the Philippines Will Definitely Compete; Our Country Has Hope of Winning the Championship Again</h3>
<p>After the Guangzhou volleyball players of our country went south together, the hope is also one of the greatest items. Java did not participate, and Japan is actually far behind. The final is really between China and the Philippines. This time, our country has combined the elites of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai to form a strong team. The strength is really above the previous Games. The volleyball in the Philippines has indeed improved recently. The fierce competition between China and the Philippines is to be expected. However, our country will win against the Philippines eight or nine times out of ten. Therefore, when Chief Leader Wang Zhengting arrived in the Philippines, in his conversation, he also placed our country's hopes on volleyball.</p>
<h3>Basketball Championship: The Philippines Has the Most Confidence; Our Country Only Hopes to Beat Japan</h3>
<p>In the basketball championship, the situation is a three-legged rivalry, with the Philippines being dominant. This championship is also one of the ones that the Philippines has been striving for in previous Games. Its technology and ball skills are indeed unmatched by other countries. Therefore, the Philippines is still the most confident and hopeful. Since Japan suffered at our hands in the last Games, they have been complacent, which is chilling. Moreover, the last Games were held in Tokyo, and there were questions among the referees. This time, our country's players have also been gathered together for some time. Therefore, although there may not be a guarantee of defeating the Philippines in the future, we will definitely be able to defeat the enemy and win tonight when we first meet Japan. Java has also not participated in basketball.</p>
<h3>Baseball Championship: The Philippines Rises as a New Force; Japan Should Not Be Too Optimistic</h3>
<p>In the baseball item, our country is the most hopeless, but it is not discouraged or intimidated by the immaturity of the art. Therefore, although there were people who advocated not sending a baseball team before the event, it eventually became a re-engagement to respond to the spirit of this sport. Japan has possessed the baseball championship for several Games, but there is a great possibility of change this time. Japan's first-class pitcher Nakamura Mineo broke his ankle during practice and will not be able to take the field and show off his skills, which is a major blow to Japan. At the same time, the baseball strength of the Philippines should not be ignored. The reason for the Philippines' failure in the last Games was the inability to recruit first-class players. Because the good players in the Philippines are concentrated under the Philippine Baseball League, at that time, the Philippine Sports Association believed that the players under the league were all professional athletes and rejected them. But now it is different. The Philippine Sports Association has recognized the athletes under the league as amateur players. Therefore, this year, 20 good players will be selected from the league to compete against Japan. Japan's victory is not guaranteed. It is a pity that our compatriots in Honolulu cannot return to the country to serve, otherwise, the results would be satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Track and Field, All-Around, and Swimming: To Be Handled by Japan; Our Country Has More Hope of Scoring Points</h3>
<p>As for the four items of track and field, all-around, and swimming, they will undoubtedly fall into the hands of the Japanese. There is no doubt about it. If our athletes work hard, they may not be completely wiped out. Fu Baolu's pole vault and Liu Changchun's sprint both hold great hope. As for the Philippines, although they will definitely not score as many points as the Japanese in these four items, it is inevitable that they will pose a great threat to the Japanese. For example, in track and field, Torrebiva's high jump, Kamandi's shot put, Yeder's middle distance in track events, Garcia's high hurdles, and Alabur and White's middle hurdles are all masterpieces. The strengths of China, Japan, and the Philippines are equal in the 200 meters, which is especially feared by the Japanese. In the all-around, Philippine athlete Bard recently created a new record in the pentathlon, as well as the relay. The Filipinos will also not be willing to fall behind in swimming. For example, Irde Alfonso and Zikiram have both created world records. The Japanese are not allowed to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Gospel for Shanghainese: News Radio Broadcast; Starting Tonight at 8 PM, Broadcast from Overseas Chinese and US Stations</h3>
<p>The Far Eastern Games held in the Philippines will use shortwave radio waves. The situation of the competition that day will be transmitted to Shanghai that evening to broadcast to the whole country. The Philippine KZRM radio station will transmit the electricity. The Lido Hotel in Shanghai is equipped with a shortwave radio to receive it exclusively. Then, the XMHC Overseas Chinese radio station (frequency 700) and the XQHE US radio station (frequency 1460) will simultaneously broadcast after 8 PM. Starting on the 12th, the 13th, 14th, 17th, and 18th will continue for four days. To facilitate Chinese listeners, everything is exempted from Chinese translation.</p>

<h3>Amendment to the Articles of Association: The Attitude of the Dutch East Indies Makes Japan Pessimistic; Use Holding the Next Games in Java as a Condition for Exchange; But the Next Games Have Been Set in China, So Japan is Greatly Disappointed</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 11th) The Far Eastern Games Executive Committee is scheduled to meet on the 17th or 18th, and the matter of amending the articles of association is expected to be brought up. (Electrical Communication Agency, Manila, 11th) Dutch East Indies representative Dr. Brandt, when meeting with Japanese representatives Matsuzawa and Abe on the 10th at noon, reserved the right to approve or disapprove the issue of Manchukuo's participation. It is reported that Dr. Brandt hopes to hold the next Games in Java, using this as a condition for exchange, expressing goodwill towards accommodating Japan's hopes. However, judging from the talk of Dr. Ira Lian of the Philippine Sports Association, the next Games have already been set to be held in Shanghai, China. In fact, it is difficult to hold them in Java. In short, on the Japanese side, the future of the scheduled general assembly is expected to be more difficult. Therefore, Japan is carefully studying countermeasures to guide the constitutional amendment issue, the issue of Manchukuo's participation, etc. to be beneficial. The future trend is highly valued.</p>
<h3>The Philippine Track and Field Results are Amazing; Our Athletes' Results Have Also Improved; Peng Yongxin's Javelin is 52 Meters; Leng Peigen's Discus is 39 Meters; Fu Baolu and Chen Baogiu Have Also Made Progress</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 11th) Our country's athletes continued to practice on the 11th, and everyone made progress. Leng Peigen threw the discus 39 meters, Chen Baogiu pushed the shot put 12.70 meters, Fu Baolu's pole vault was 3.80 meters, and Peng Yongxin's javelin was 52 meters.</p>
<h3>Philippine Track and Field Competition Shakes the Far Eastern Record</h3>
<p>(Manila, 11th) The performance of the Philippine track and field athletes in the final practice at the Games' track and field field today has shaken many Far Eastern records. The following is what the Philippine authorities announced:</p>
<p>Amanti's Discus: 138 feet, 2 inches</p>
<p>Yeder's 1500 Meters: 4 minutes, 6.6 seconds</p>
<p>Alabula's Middle Hurdles: 54.2 seconds</p>
<p>Kadar's 400 Meters: 50 seconds</p>
<p>There are still some, but the authorities are keeping them secret. This result has caused a major threat to Japan.</p>
<h3>Today's Baseball: Japan and the Philippines Have Fierce Competition</h3>
<p>(Electrical Communication Agency, Japan, Manila) The opening ceremony of the 10th Far Eastern Olympics is scheduled to be held at the baseball field at 2 PM on the 12th. Athletes from various countries are showing an unusually tense state, pouring all their strength into the final practice. Predictions of various competitions have been made before the start of the competition. The one that is particularly interesting is baseball. The Philippines believes that it has gathered elites this time to form a team, and declares that the Philippines will win. Although the Japanese army cannot send pitcher Nakamura Mineo due to injury, the overall batting is very excellent, which makes the Philippine side feel uneasy. Japanese associations are carrying out large-scale activities for ticket sales and award preparations.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain: Chinese and Japanese Athletes are Very Happy</h3>
<p>(Japanese United News Agency, Manila, 10th) At around 3 PM on the 10th, it rained heavily, eliminating the heat. Athletes from China and Japan were very happy. All sports stopped practicing, except for the swimmers, who leisurely continued to practice in the heavy rain.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>(1) The Beginning Era</p>
<p>Before the 20th century, there were more than ten countries, large and small, on the coast of Asia, with hundreds of millions of people, each living and working in peace and contentment, with little interaction. There was even less to talk about in terms of sports. Since the Philippines became a colony of the United States, more and more Americans came to the Philippines to promote education. In 1911, under the advocacy and management of an American named Brown (Flwood S Bronr), the Philippine Sports Association was established. As such, the Far Eastern Sports Association also began.</p>
<p>Before the Far Eastern Sports Association was established, the Philippine Carnival was held every February. During the carnival, a grand sports meeting was always held. In the year of Xuantong 3 of the former Qing Dynasty, the Philippine Sports Association initiated an invitation to China and Japan to participate in the carnival in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. At that time, China sent track and field and football athletes to participate. Japan also sent two tennis players and a baseball team to attend. With this motivation, the Philippine Sports Association initiated the organization of the Far Eastern Sports Association and appointed Krone, Brown, and Tuttherly to form an organizing committee to preside over all preparatory matters.</p>
<p>(2) Brown's Efforts</p>
<p>In view of this trend, the Philippines further proposed to organize the Far Eastern Games, modeled after the World Games, initiated by China, Japan, and the Philippines. The Games would be held in major cities in East Asia every other year, with the aim of promoting the relations between the three countries and the sports of their citizens. In September of the first year of the Republic of China, Brown, on behalf of the Philippine Sports Association, officially visited China and Japan to propose the original plan and intention to organize the Far Eastern Sports Association. China and Japan felt that there was a similar need, so China first resolutely joined, and Japan also participated in an informal capacity. The first Games were held in Manila in February of the second year of the Republic of China during the Philippine Carnival. China officially sent athletes to the meeting. Because Japan's sports association was not yet fully organized at that time, it did not have the strength to send athletes, so it only sent a baseball team and two track and field athletes to attend. Because of the lack of detailed organization and regulations in various sports, it was not possible to achieve good results in that competition. The second Games were held in Shanghai, China. Talents from various countries greatly increased, so the results also improved a lot. Therefore, Japan declared that it would officially join the Games as a member country starting from the third Games. From then on, the foundation was firmly established, and all organizational outlines and competition rules were readily available.</p>
<p>(3) Aims and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of organizing the Far Eastern Games was to seek the great union of the countries of the Far East. Therefore, it was not considered satisfactory to have only two or three member countries join. After the closing of the first Games, Lang wanted to expand the organization of the Games, so he personally went to Bangkok, Siam, and Singapore to persuade Siam and Malaya to join. Although they all agreed to participate, unfortunately, the European War broke out, and the port was closed, so this proposal became a pipe dream. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, Brown, considering that the previous achievements had not been completed, traveled to India and Java again, still persuading them to participate. However, by the seventh Games, it was still not implemented. When the eighth Games were held in Shanghai, India sent a telegram wanting to participate. Our country replied with a welcome, but it was unsuccessful again due to events. It was not until the ninth Games held in Tokyo, Japan, that India sent athletes to participate in an unofficial capacity.</p>
<p>(4) Relationship with the Olympic Committee</p>
<p>Compared with the World Olympic Committee, the Far Eastern Sports Association is nothing more than an immature organization. Now the order of the Far Eastern Games is as far as possible in accordance with the Olympic Games, except for the special circumstances of each country not being included in this exception. All the rest have the same place. The current meeting period has been changed to once every four years, and it is conducted in the interim with the Olympic Games, so as to avoid conflicts in time.</p>
<p>The nature and relationship between the two associations are not contradictory and have a tendency to complement each other. Because the Olympic Committee has no conditions or restrictions on the Far Eastern Sports Association and does not infringe on its privileges, the Far Eastern Sports Association can therefore increase its reputation and influence. Moreover, the Olympic Committee sends one member as a special envoy to each Far Eastern Movement Meeting, and in the countries concerned, defines the famous athletes as the specialized representatives of the Olympic Committee, so as to guide the events of the Far Eastern Movement Meeting and promote the development of its affairs.</p>
<p>(5) Patronage of the World Sports Community</p>
<p>At the time of the establishment of the Far Eastern Sports Association, it was encouraged by Sloan, Ormous, and Wendell, American members of the Olympic Committee, and they gave a gold flower ring to the Far Eastern Games as a championship prize. However, the Olympic Committee did not officially recognize the Far Eastern Games until 1920. The reason for the long delay was the obstruction of the European War, not the disapproval or inattention to this new international organization. When the Olympic Committee held a regular meeting in Antwerp this year, Brown attended on behalf of the Far Eastern Sports Association, elaborating on the purpose and achievements of the Far Eastern Games. The members of all countries fully agreed and decided to send Kano Jigoro as the official of the Olympics</p>
<h3>Track and Field</h3>
<p>Representing and participating in the Fifth Far Eastern Games held in Shanghai in 1921, of the Far Eastern Committee within the Olympic Committee at that time, only Mr. Kano delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Olympic Committee at the opening of the Fifth Far Eastern Games, explained the situation at the Antwerp Conference to the Far Eastern Games, and reported the results of the Shanghai meeting to Mr. Coubertin, the President of the Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1922, Count de Baillet-Latour (i.e., the current President) Vice-President of the Olympic Committee, served as a special envoy and went from Europe to America to participate in the First Latin American Games held in the Brazilian capital in September. He also planned to go to Osaka, Japan, to participate in the Sixth Far Eastern Games in May 1923. His trip to South America was quite busy. After the meeting, he planned to inspect the physical education situation in various countries. He originally planned to travel around the Far East and finally arrive in Osaka, Japan. Japan had also actively prepared to welcome him. However, when Mr. de Baillet-Latour was about to depart from the United States, he suddenly received a telegram and was recalled to Europe due to some matter, which resulted in his inability to make the trip. This was a great disappointment to the Far Eastern Games. Subsequently, Mr. Coubertin, the President of the Olympic Committee, expressed his hope that Dr. Wang Zhengting, a new member of the Olympic Committee, would represent the Olympic Committee at the Sixth Far Eastern Games. However, due to the tense diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Mr. Wang was also unable to attend, and Mr. Kano Jigoro, a Japanese member, represented the Olympic Committee and read a congratulatory telegram at the opening ceremony.</p>

<h3>(6) Contributions and Efforts of Chinese and Filipino People to the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>The Far Eastern Athletic Association's ability to exist to this day must be attributed to the efforts of Mr. Brown. Former Philippine Governor-General Forbes and the late Governor-General Wood both provided great support for the organization and development of the Far Eastern Athletic Association. Others such as Quezon, Osias, Earnshaw of the Philippines, Crone, Marquardt, Tutheriy, England of the United States, and the late President Li Yuanhong, the late Foreign Minister Dr. Wu Tingfang, former Prime Minister Xiong Xiling, former Foreign Minister Tang Shaoyi, and the current Honorary President of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation Dr. Wang Zhengting, and Chairman Dr. Zhang Boling, etc. of our country have made many efforts and contributions to the Far Eastern Games, which we must not forget.</p>
<h3>(7) Japanese Obstruction and Sabotage of the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>In the past twenty years, the Far Eastern Games have seemed to be progressing smoothly on the surface, but in fact, they have gone through many twists and turns, and each time it has been caused by the Japanese.</p>
<p>A. The Twenty-One Demands at the Second Games. The Second Far Eastern Games were held in Shanghai in 1915. At that time, Japan was making the Twenty-One Demands to our country, and the diplomatic relations between China and Japan were on the verge of breaking off. The Japanese public opinion circles criticized the Japan Athletic Association for not participating in the Far Eastern Games, but in the end, it was still decided to participate. When the Japanese athletes arrived in Shanghai, the Games had already been opened for two days. When the Japanese athletes entered the field and passed in front of the stands, they were spat upon by the audience, which almost caused a disaster. Fortunately, those in charge in our country understood the general situation and explained to the audience, so nothing happened. This was one of the twists and turns of the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>B. The Unreasonable Demand by the Japanese to Postpone the Fourth Games</p>
<p>In 1919, the Fourth Games were held in Manila. Unfortunately, a major wave suddenly occurred before the Games. Again, the Japanese complained and caused an unprecedented major problem for the Games. The reason for this incident stemmed from the Japan Athletic Association. The Japan Athletic Association believed that the Games period coincided with the school examination period and informed the Philippines, the country concerned, requesting that the Games period be postponed to August. The Philippine Athletic Association believed that August was the rainy season in the southern country and was not suitable for large-scale international games, and resolutely rejected Japan's unreasonable request. The Japan Athletic Association was embarrassed and angry, and suddenly announced that it would not send athletes to participate in the Games, and declared its permanent withdrawal from the Far Eastern Athletic Association. However, at this time, there was a great uproar in Japanese public opinion circles, and they opposed this move by Japanese athletics. The Japanese finally admitted that they were wrong and still participated in the Games. This was the second of the twists and turns of the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>C. The Japanese Athletes' Walkout at the Seventh Games. The Seventh Games were held in the Philippines in 1925. On the first day of the opening of the Games, the Japanese player Noto, whom the Japanese considered the most promising player in the 400-meter final, was disqualified. Thereupon, all the Japanese athletes protested together, and as a result, they all withdrew from the field. Fortunately, Philippine Governor-General Wood came forward to mediate, and thereupon the Japanese withdrew from track and field, but other competitions continued. This was the third of the twists and turns of the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>D. The Twists and Turns of Japanese Movement and the False State's Participation in this Games</p>
<p>In this Games, the Japanese disregarded world justice and used the puppet state they had established to demand to join the Games. During the Sino-Philippine Standing Committee meeting held in Shanghai, they made this unreasonable request. After being severely refuted by our country's representatives, the Japanese threatened to withdraw from the Games. As a result, they still knew they were wrong and still participated, and the Far Eastern Games escaped from the storm again. This was the fourth of the twists and turns of the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<h3>(8) Future and Dangerous Transportation</h3>
<p>Looking back at the twenty years since the Far Eastern Games were founded, up to now, all the past Games have been held, and the Japanese have obstructed them four times. China and the Philippines have always adhered to their original intentions and strongly supported and maintained the Games, while the Japanese have sabotaged them everywhere. Although this Games was fortunately opened, there are still many hidden reefs in the future. The puppet state is not qualified to attend the Games and is under the protection of the Japanese. It plans to organize the so-called "Asian Games," which are all harmful insects that destroy the Far Eastern Games. The next Games will be held in Shanghai, and everything will be presided over by our country, so there will be no problems. However, when the 12th Games are held, they will be hosted by the Japanese again. At this time, the issue of the puppet state's participation will definitely be revived, and the Japanese will definitely support its participation. At this time, if our country does not have a proper solution, it will inevitably withdraw from the Games.</p>
<p>Since our country fundamentally does not recognize the existence of the puppet state, we should find a way to fundamentally eliminate the puppet state. We hope that when the 12th Games are held in Tokyo, our country's government will have recovered the lost territory of Northeast China and the puppet state will no longer exist, so that our country's sports circles will not be troubled by this issue. Otherwise, if Japan allows the puppet state to join, we will withdraw in shame, and all countries in the world will laugh at our sports circles' lack of resistance.</p>
<h3>Third Day of the Two Rivers Revival Anniversary</h3>
<p>Today, the Two Rivers Women's Physical Education Normal School in Jiangwan, this city, is holding a student achievement exhibition. From 8:00 am, the public is welcome to attend and provide criticism and guidance throughout the day. The achievement exhibition is not divided into rooms and is all held in the school's auditorium. There are groups such as the basketball team's northern expedition to Pingjin, memorial prizes for the eastern expedition to Japan, memorial prizes for the southern expedition to Minyue, all-sports Games trophy prizes, Shanghai Western Youth Games, Chinese Women's Games, and International Women's Games trophy prizes. Other items on display include architectural methods, sports postures, and other patterns, as well as homework achievements in Chinese language, exercise physiology, and other subjects. In the afternoon, there will be basketball, tennis, and baseball games to entertain the audience.</p>
<p>Also, the concert yesterday attracted about 3,000 guests throughout the day, which was even more enthusiastic than the first day. All fourteen scenes of the program were performed with Western music, with clear singing voices and skilled techniques.</p>
<h3>Qingxin Girls' Middle School Sports Meet Postponed</h3>
<p>Qingxin Girls' Middle School in Dananmen, Nanshi, this city, was originally scheduled to hold its spring sports meet and the school's alumni association annual meeting on the afternoon of the 12th. Now, due to insufficient preparation, it has been decided to postpone it for a week, and the two meetings will still be held at the same time. Unless otherwise notified, all admission tickets issued by the school will still be valid at that time.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Radical Progress of the Jiangxi Agricultural College: 50,000 Yuan in Funding, Divided into Five Departments</h3>
<p>(Nanchang, 11th) The Jiangxi Agricultural College has an annual operating expense of 550,000 yuan and is divided into five departments: agriculture, economics, extension, plant production, animal production, and rural education. A large-scale experimental field is being built near Xishan, with equipment costs of 100,000 yuan, to carry out breeding, pest control, and the production of blood serum for the prevention and control of livestock diseases.</p>
<h3>The Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau States that the Joint Examination Cannot Be Avoided, and Students Announce a Strike</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The principals of various private middle schools met with Wang Chongzhi, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, on the morning of the 11th regarding the joint examination. Director Wang was busy with official duties and sent Section Chief Qian to meet them instead. The students' eight demands were presented on behalf of the principals, and the social affairs authorities stated that it was impossible to waive the examination, but the questions could take into account the actual situation and be made slightly simpler. (Nanjing, 11th) Middle school students in Nanjing went on strike today to protest the joint examination and issued a declaration against the joint examination, which mainly included: 1. It violates the principles of education; 2. It restricts the development of students' talents; 3. It damages students' physical and mental health. It also stated that the joint examination has no practical value, the selection of questions for the joint examination is prone to losing focus, the treatment in the joint examination is unequal, and the effectiveness of the joint examination is a bird's-eye view. We earnestly request the education authorities to uphold their sincere love for students and withdraw the order for the joint examination. We will implement a strike from today to express our determination and awaken the authorities. We hope that compatriots across the country will provide substantial assistance.</p>
<h3>Conflicts Also Occur at Pinghongda College</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 11th) At Hongda College, students and the principal clashed this morning over the joint examination. The principal fired a gun to show his feelings. Fortunately, no misfortune occurred.</p>
<h3>Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau Instructs on the Guiding Principles for Middle School Training Students</h3>
<p>Yesterday, he convened a discussion with middle school principals and deans of students. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau convened a discussion with middle school principals and deans of students in this city at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 3:00 pm yesterday. More than 150 principals and deans of students from schools such as Hujiang Affiliated Middle School, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School, Daxia Affiliated Middle School, Aiguo, Wuben, Jingye, Junyi, McLaren, Zhonghua Vocational Education, Shanghai Middle School, Nanyang Middle School, Huadong Girls' Middle School, Pudong Middle School, Shanghai Girls' Middle School, Chengdong Girls' Middle School, East Asia Physical Education Teacher Training School, Aiqun, and Guangxia attended. More than 200 people, including Wei Ke, Chen Qun, Cao Huiqun, Lin Zhongke, Ni Wenya, Jia Botao, Jia Foru, Li Haoshan, Liao Maoru, Yan Zhenyu, Wang Xiaoying, and Shen Tilan, were present. Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau gave a speech, instructing on the guiding principles for middle schools to train students. Finally, Cao Huiqun, Liao Maoru, Chen Jicheng, Li Haoshan, Sun Letao, and others expressed their opinions. It lasted for more than two hours before it ended. The full text of Director Pan's speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Today, the Municipal Education Bureau invited all middle school principals and deans of students in the city to exchange opinions and discuss several middle school issues. The number of public middle schools established in Shanghai is very small, accounting for less than 5% of the total. To make progress in middle school education in the city, we certainly cannot only look at the municipal middle schools. Moreover, due to the limited funds of the municipal government and various other factors such as location, manpower, and material resources, we can frankly admit that the number of municipal schools is small, and their quality is not necessarily better than that of private schools. Or, it can be said that there are many areas where they are not as good as private middle schools that have a long history and are well-run. Therefore, we believe that to enable Shanghai middle school students to receive a good education, public and private middle schools must exchange opinions and work together. Only then can middle school education in Shanghai have the possibility of upward progress. The reason why we invited everyone to participate in this meeting during a very busy time is nothing more than to take this opportunity to report to you the several things that the Education Bureau hopes to do for middle schools in Shanghai in the future. At the same time, we are also very willing to take this opportunity to hear from several gentlemen who are very interested in, very researched, and very experienced in middle school education, and to provide guidance on the main road that Shanghai middle schools should take in the future and the policies that should be adopted, so that teachers who run middle schools in the city can use them as a reference. Therefore, although this meeting has no resolution, if everyone agrees that the results of today's discussion are a road that should be taken and a policy that should be adopted, and that we are planning the best road for middle school students to run education, then middle school education will certainly achieve the purpose of development.</p>
<p>The most important key to the opinions that the Education Bureau wants to contribute is to first understand how Shanghai middle school education should be done in the future. Many people say that many disputes have occurred in universities in the past few years, and they are all blamed on university students, saying that they do not meet our ideals, or they are blamed on school administrators for not fulfilling their responsibilities. In fact, university problems are very complicated. From the perspective of educational administration, the management of higher education is naturally presided over by the Ministry of Education, and I believe that there are plans to improve the methods there. Therefore, our local educational administrative organs start by paying attention to middle schools first. However, if middle school students are well-trained, even if universities often have problems now, if many good middle school students enter universities in a few years, universities will gradually change. Therefore, it can be said that it is indirectly laying the foundation for university education. It is not that we are ignoring higher education, but in my personal opinion, the age of middle school students is a period of great change that can be either east or west, which is not comparable to the age of university students who have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, middle school students should be absolutely led and managed by teachers and staff within the school. University students may have the ability to move automatically, and this issue is worth studying separately. As for middle school students, we do not deny that they have the ability to do extracurricular work or extracurricular activities. But I dare say that middle school students' extracurricular activities and extracurricular work must be guided by teachers and staff at all times, so that they can avoid being led to the right path. Because middle school students' knowledge and learning are still in the organizational stage, if there is no appropriate leadership, they will inevitably go astray. Therefore, the responsibility of middle school teachers and staff to students is actually even more important than that of university teachers and staff. I think everyone has the same feeling. However, the methods of each school are different in the past. Some tend to be strict, some are more laissez-faire, and the results are also different. Under this circumstance, we certainly cannot universally hope that Shanghai middle schools can create a kind of student. To achieve this hope, we must discuss more on training in order to move towards a common path. Therefore, the first point is that we hope that middle school principals and deans of students should help the Education Bureau, and the Education Bureau should help middle school principals and deans of students, and work together to complete this important mission of leading middle school students and training middle school students. In the future, middle school students' exploration of learning and extracurricular activities, the responsibility for leadership and training, completely rests on the teachers and staff, and should not let students act blindly, or say that students' movements or youth movements, the school does not allow him to move, for fear that students will object, or someone calls him to move, if he is not allowed to move, the person who calls him to move will object. Because of this suspicion and speculation, teachers and staff are unwilling to take more responsibility to guide students. In fact, we do not deny the ability of middle school students to act, but middle school students' activities must be under the guidance of the principal, the dean of students, and other teachers and staff to be able to carry out proper activities. If middle school students are unwilling to be led by the principal, the dean of students, etc., and go to activities casually, the school should strictly correct them. The Education Bureau will definitely provide assistance for this kind of corrective sanctions, as long as it is reasonable and it is something that teachers and staff should do, the Education Bureau will definitely help teachers and staff to bring students into line. I think some schools are already doing this, and some schools are also definitely planning to do it, but I am afraid that many schools still do not understand the attitude of the Education Bureau, so the first point is to put forward this idea and make a sincere hope and request to everyone. For the sake of middle school students, for the sake of the entire society, and for the sake of the future of the nation, we must hurry up and take this responsibility. If we do not find this line of defense very firmly, I am afraid that the phenomena seen in universities in the past few years may affect middle schools in the future. If it once affects them, then the damage to society and the nation, the magnitude of the crime, will be even more serious than that of universities. The incurable consequences in the future will definitely exceed our expectations.</p>
<p>Second, the guiding principles for training middle school students in the future. Each school must have a plan to train and guide students now. Today, I would like to contribute a method for your reference, that is, to implement the outline of the New Life Movement. The method formulated by the Education Bureau is only an outline. The implementation details of this method still need to be formulated in detail by each school. The various words of the New Life Movement only contain all the reforms that should be made in various daily life activities, and they are very common and not novel and outstanding. If there is no slogan or method for the New Life Movement, if the schools train students well, they are implementing the New Life Movement anytime and anywhere. However, of course, there are many places where everything can be done to achieve twice the result with half the effort. We seize this opportunity and grasp this New Life Movement as an outline for training students, and we will definitely be able to achieve great results. However, although the New Life Movement is a common thing, if it is not done well and the name is borrowed, it will be counterproductive. It seems that the name and content of the New Life Movement are indeed very good and should be done in this way. If school teachers and staff and public officials do not think of ways to implement it, then this movement will have no results. To implement it, we must teach people to implement it first. One type is public officials, and the other type is school teachers and staff. These two types of people must use their own implementation to influence ordinary students. Students in school are studying, and in the family and society, they can influence others. It can be seen that the relationship of the school is significant. Therefore, schools must implement the New Life Movement effectively, Ningke will do it step by step, and do not hope to do everything well in one day. This method is only prescribed in the outline by the Education Bureau. The implementation steps must be determined by each school according to the environment. Each school hopes to handle the details of the plan in phases. When handling it, we must pay attention to the teachers and staff themselves, so that the teachers and staff can promote the students. Therefore, the implementation method of the New Life Movement in primary and secondary schools does not hope that students will be allowed to do it indiscriminately in the absence of guidance in the name of the New Life Movement. We must attach importance to doing it, and we do not want an empty frame. The so-called empty frame is like organizing branches, conducting elections, taking pride in being an elected official, and even cleverly setting up names to compete with each other. To be honest, the New Life Movement in primary and secondary schools is the training of students, and it is what schools should train students in at that time. Students should not be allowed to run on the wrong road by themselves, and the name of the New Life Movement should not be used as a stepping stone for other activities, and absolutely cannot let this kind of person who goes the wrong way spread. Teachers and staff must resolutely stand up to take this responsibility. Training by teachers and staff will definitely reduce errors and complete the New Life Movement. This is the second point of hope. What you principals and deans of students are responsible for is not only the principals and deans of students, that is, all teachers and staff should also be responsible. At present, some people in the school think that guiding students is only the responsibility of the training staff or the principal, and that teachers can be irresponsible. I hope that everyone will change this atmosphere and make all teachers and staff in each school understand that leading and training students is the responsibility of every teacher, not the responsibility of any one person. We believe that the power of good teachers and staff in schools is greater than that of others, so we can know that if you want the school spirit to be good and the student discipline to be good, you must pay the same attention when hiring teachers. In this way, the school spirit can be good. In addition to setting up methods for the New Life Movement, the most important center of gravity must be placed on the teachers and staff. Teachers and staff should lead by example. If students do something wrong, they must be corrected. I hope that each school will implement it as soon as possible. The Education Bureau will send people to inspect it at any time in the future.</p>
<p>The third point I want to report on this occasion is about teaching affairs. Shanghai has held two joint examinations. Recently, the Ministry of Education has promulgated new regulations, and graduates of normal schools should also take the joint examination. The Education Bureau has asked the Ministry of Education to postpone this for one semester. The reason is that time is tight. When the Ministry of Education promulgated this regulation, some normal schools had already taken the examination, and some school students were visiting. I am afraid that it will be delayed, so we request a postponement. As for senior high school general subjects and junior high school, they will still be held, and primary schools will still not be held. The subjects of the middle school joint examination are stipulated by the Ministry of Education, and the methods will follow the past situation and be appropriately formulated.</p>
<p>Because of the joint examination, I thought of a subject problem. The purpose of the joint examination is, on the one hand, to make the level of middle schools more uniform, and on the other hand, to make students pay more attention to the curriculum. However, we cannot completely achieve the purpose of uniformity of degrees by relying solely on the joint examination. Therefore, we are now considering how to make the teaching level of each subject more uniform. Now each school has its own special situation. Some schools are good at Chinese, some value English more, and some are good at mathematics and science. Only by thinking about making the teaching progress of each subject in each school have a uniform method can the Education Bureau now plans to compile a progress chart for each subject, each grade, and each semester based on the curriculum standards of the Ministry of Education. This chart cannot be compiled solely by the staff of the Education Bureau, for fear that difficulties will arise in practice in the future. Therefore, we hope to cooperate with the school to formulate a relatively applicable chart. The Education Bureau has notified each school to help and recommend outstanding teachers with experience and research in each subject to jointly compile this teaching progress chart for each subject in middle schools in Shanghai. This work is planned to start in late May and be completed in early September, with a preparation time of three and a half months. After the chart is compiled, it will be distributed to each middle school for trial implementation. It is hoped that from the first semester of the 23rd year, the level of students in each class will follow this chart. Although it cannot be fully achieved at once, after one or two years, it will gradually achieve a more uniform level. The Education Bureau will send people to each school at any time to investigate. This chart will be used as a standard and should not be too fast or too slow, so that senior high school general subjects and junior high school have a uniform pace, and there is no phenomenon of differences in each subject. We hope that everyone will help with this work. If you have any comments, you can report them to the Education Bureau at any time.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is hoped that the teachers and staff in middle schools should preferably be full-time and less part-time, because if we want to hope that teachers will lead students, it is impossible for part-time teachers. Furthermore, in the future, whether it is a public or private school, the administrative aspects of exchange and research group activities should be borne by the principal, dean of students, and dean of teaching. In addition, there should be more teachers and staff, and their thoughts, abilities, and time should be used within the school, and they should no longer specialize in running outside the school. There is a slogan, that is, "School teachers and staff should go to school." If ordinary teachers and staff focus on teaching, students will not neglect their studies. This important point, I am willing to plead for middle school students to teachers and staff.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in the middle school, whether it is training in subjects or group activities, we hope that teachers and staff will take on major responsibilities. We want to make ordinary teachers and staff take on the responsibility of training in addition to teaching. The Education Bureau will closely cooperate with each school in the future and conduct investigations at any time. I hope that each school will help the Education Bureau to realize the progress of middle school education in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>General Meeting of the China Education Construction Society: Teng Yangzhi's Report on His Observations and Reflections on Japanese Education; Decision Made on the Research Focus for the Next General Meeting</h3>
<p>The China Education Construction Society held a general meeting of its members at Guangxia Middle School the other day. Teng Yangzhi reported on his observations and reflections on Japanese education. Several important matters were discussed and resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Attending Members</h3>
<p>A total of more than 20 members attended, including Huang Yangyu, Sun Yuanzeng, Li Xuefeng, Xu Wancheng, Tan Tengfang, Liu Yiqing, Zeng Yanhua, Wang Jinyi, Chen Jingyu, Teng Yangzhi, Wang Yunshi, Gao Zhisheng, Zhang Zhonghuan, Lu Shaoji, Cheng Kuanzhi, Wu Zhiqian, Li Chao, etc. Sun Yuanzeng chaired the meeting, and Gao Zhisheng and Cheng Kuanzhi served as secretaries.</p>
<h3>Observation Report</h3>
<p>First, Teng Yangzhi reported on his observations and reflections after inspecting Japanese education: (1) From a social perspective, the entire Japanese society, from the government to the general public, focuses on the idea of ​​invading China. The general level of the Japanese people is relatively high. The number of people receiving compulsory education accounts for more than 99.5%. People are able to maintain order, pay attention to etiquette, and the three items of clothing, food, and housing are simple. Travel is convenient and smooth. The people of the whole country are working hard towards the general goal of "loyalty to the emperor and love for the country." Regarding the invasion of China, they generally believe that China's demise is inevitable, but Japan is wronged to be burdened by China's demise. Therefore, Japan should work hard to seize China.</p>
<h3>Military Training</h3>
<p>In terms of military training, the key points of school military training are (1) teaching by active-duty military officers, (2) practicing with real guns on the ground, and (3) treating students as soldiers. Military organs and educational organs are integrated. In addition, there is youth training, with elementary schools as the center and presided over by elementary school principals. In-service soldiers are trained with a martial spirit, with strict organization, encouraging people to die for the public, valuing practicality and not focusing on appearances, and doing things in a down-to-earth manner. Those who take public office are willing to take responsibility.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>The teaching methods are simple and lack change. The teaching materials are issued by the Ministry of Education and are consistent across the country and are very simple, but students learn a lot because the supplementary materials are rich. Students' learning attitude emphasizes spirit, and they pay special attention to physical education. The equipment is very complete and focuses on experiments. Teachers are secure in their jobs and rarely change jobs. Strictly speaking, Japanese culture does not have a national culture of Japanization. In the old aspect, it absorbs Chinese culture, such as loyalty, filial piety, and Shinto teaching, which dominates the entire Japanese society. In the new aspect, it absorbs Western culture, such as researching science, applying science, and promoting mechanization and electrification.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Proposals</h3>
<p>After Teng's report, the proposals were discussed. (1) Regarding the proposal to visit the Huangdu Chicken Farm on a regular basis, it was decided to visit on May 20. (2) Regarding the proposal to assign members to collect the Huangdu Chicken Farm shares, it was decided to assign Sun Kangzeng, Liu Yiqing, and Zhang Zhonghuan to be responsible for the collection. (3) Regarding the proposal to collect old shares and solicit new shareholders on a regular basis, it was decided to collect all shares before May 15. (4) Regarding the proposal to determine the research focus of the next general meeting of members, it was decided that how to train young people should be the research focus of the next general meeting of members, and Teng Yangzhi, Sun Kangzeng, Lu Jishao, and Zeng Chang were requested to conduct preliminary research and submit a written report at the general meeting. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The gold market changed quite rapidly yesterday. The meeting between the silver faction and the president was held today. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the future, but all kinds of news are quite unfavorable, which caused buyers to hold back and sellers to be more active. The market situation was stable and then weakened. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and the United States both fell, but the forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange opened lower but closed higher, increasing by 1.5 to 3.8 li.

However, people were still timid, and the favorable news about silver prices still failed to improve the market, and the market still declined. According to a Reuters telegram that day, the president had instructed the Ministry of Finance to accommodate the opinions of the silver faction, so the silver bill would be proposed soon. However, someone in Washington advocated abandoning the proposal to nationalize silver. Therefore, the market was weak and stable in the morning. Although there were no official telegrams in the afternoon, at this time of the silver meeting, unfavorable telegrams such as issuing silver coins as reserve, buying silver to return to the state were more prevalent.

In terms of clearing and settlement, although it was very active the day before due to the resumption of business by foreign merchants, yesterday it was still moderately complex and not too inferior. It is estimated that foreign banks cleared and settled more than 2.1 million in bills, more than 5.0 million in various goods and exchange pledge miscellaneous payments, more than 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, more than 800,000 in telegraphic transfer payments, and 500,000 in warehousing. Chinese banks cleared and settled more than 3.2 million in bills, more than 4.6 million in various goods and exchange pledge miscellaneous payments, more than 300,000 in foreign exchange payments, more than 600,000 in customs duties, more than 2 million in foreign machinery payments, and 800,000 in warehousing. Japanese banks cleared and settled more than 2.3 million in bills, more than 5.2 million in various goods and exchange pledge miscellaneous payments, and 600,000 in warehousing. Native banks cleared and settled more than 47 million in foreign public contracts, more than 4.9 million in interbank loan payments, more than 400,000 in inter-regional remittances, 8-900,000 in cash receipts, 1.3 million in foreign pledge transactions, redemption, and new transactions, 800,000 in banknote redemptions, 1.4 million in banknotes issued, 200,000 in customer source, 200,000 in destination. For interbank loan transactions, 4.7 million in transfers and new transactions in the morning session, 300,000 in gold market transactions, and 400,000 in transactions at the Small General Association. In addition, the total number of exchanges at the local clearing house was 7.19 million silver dollars, 1,004 yuan and 0.432, including 3.5 million silver dollars, 1,789 yuan and 0.51, and 3.68921481 silver dollars transferred.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Coins, Small Silver Dollars, Weaken Again</h3>
<p>In recent days, the subsidiary coins, small silver dollars, have continued to fall. After rebounding the day before yesterday, they weakened again yesterday due to the influx of bottom goods. It is estimated that the Jiangnan small silver dollars were 834 yuan for both the morning and afternoon sessions yesterday, down 6 yuan from the day before yesterday. For transaction volumes, 9,000 jiao were traded in the morning session and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon session. The Guangdong small silver dollars were 741.2 yuan in the morning session, down 0.7 yuan from the day before yesterday. The afternoon session was changed to 0.8 yuan, to 740.04 yuan. As a result, it fell 1.5 yuan from the day before yesterday. However, the market price of copper coins tended to be firm, with both the morning and afternoon sessions at 330,000 qianwen, up 2,000 from the day before yesterday. The transaction amount was 11,020 strings of qianwen, equivalent to 9,400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Wavered and Declined; Loose Positions on the Table; Dropped by 0.1 to 0.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange turned from wavering to weakening, and people were relieved. The market atmosphere was depressed. Because there was no change in the environment, the market price was not stimulated. However, the rise and fall of the market situation depended on the supply and demand of the positions. In terms of money supply, tea industry had a relatively large use and the silk industry had a limited use. It was faintly heard that the Ministry of Finance had more goods for sale, and the profit-seeking transactions in the financial sector inevitably reduced the color. In addition, the major short sellers did not replenish, and the positions on the table were loose. The market price showed a phenomenon that it was difficult to rise. The whole day passed from the morning head session to the afternoon closing and almost all was wavering downward. Each session was about 0.12 to 0.3 yuan lower. Only the morning second session was slightly chaotic. The afternoon closing was more firm. This was because the long and short positions of the gangs had different swaps, and the market price had the regret of being uneven due to the different choices of both sides. However, the trend was still sluggish. The sellers were mostly No. 4 and No. 16/17, etc., and there were many retail investors coming in and out. In the afternoon, No. 30 slightly bought various items, No. 43 entered the 19th Customs, and No. 53 entered the Salt Tax, and No. 75 entered the 96th, so the market slightly rebounded. It is feared that the future will still be wavering. As a result, the market price uniformly continued to fall, generally by about 0.12 to 0.5 yuan. The 22nd Customs fell the most by 0.65 yuan, and the Disarmament fell 0.8 yuan. The total transaction volume was 14,576,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot and 14,575,000 yuan in futures. The results of its highs and lows are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Falls Again</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Bank reported that the New York stock market yesterday (the 10th) broke the low record of this year. It was heard that because the accounts of speculative clients were slightly cut at the weekend, and the drought in the Midwest of the United States, the transportation of grains was expected to decrease, and railway and agricultural stocks caused a sharp decline. However, before the closing, due to the alarming news about wheat, there was no rain in sight, and the price rose sharply by 5 points (the maximum limit). The stock market also turned flat. The small exchange and the stock exchange were slightly the same, and the prices of securities were generally low. However, American public bonds created a new peak this year. It was heard that banks, insurance companies, and private individuals bought them because they had confidence that the government would eventually adopt a conservative fiscal policy. According to the agent's report, (securities) suffered two severe sell-offs, which were heard to be largely from professional speculators. The recovery at the end was still good, and it seemed that it would be mixed for the time being, but it would be easy to rise if there was good news. (Wheat) There was a large dust storm, and the public participated in a surge, predicting that the price would rise significantly. North America is currently suffering from a severe drought. (Cotton) The market was mediocre, waiting for the silver plan, and the foothold was firm. (Rubber) It fell in the early morning due to the impact of Singapore and London. The urgent sell-off seemed to have ended, and manufacturers bought quite a lot because the technical position had improved due to the sharp fall in recent days. (Sugar) There was a slight reaction, but the technical position and statistics were very sound, and the sugar bill had been signed. (Silver) It opened slightly lower in the early morning due to the previous night's sell-off and the accumulation of loss limit orders. Later, due to a large number of purchases in May, which was obviously from a normal source, the market turned around immediately. The news from Washington was divergent, and speculators believed that this was because silver would eventually have some solution. The total transaction volume of the day was 2.13 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>May 9 May 10 Rise and Fall</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 95.71 93.91 Down 1.80</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Tends to Rise Amidst Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable and quiet, but the situation is very mixed, rising and falling suddenly, making it difficult to grasp. The market opened in the morning with the overseas cotton market stable, and there was news that Japanese merchants were selling, and the market price rose slightly. The market opened in the afternoon and the market atmosphere was very tired and tended to fall, but at the 23rd session, it suddenly jumped more than one yuan, and the atmosphere in the market suddenly became tense. It was heard that North China also intended to absorb 20 count yarns, because the price of Chinese yarn was higher than that of Japanese yarn.</p>
<h3>The Price of Yarn Increases by One Dollar</h3>
<p>The market opened with the price of marked yarn rising, due to the previous day's rapid price decline, the stable price of foreign cotton, and profit-takers covering their positions. Prices for each month rose by 2.4, 5, and 7 cents. In the afternoon, prices fell sharply as Japanese merchants sold. However, news that yarn from the Tianjin gang was entering the market spurred renewed buying interest, resulting in prices for each month rising by 7 to 9 cents, and even 1.1 to 1.3 dollars. Total transactions for the day amounted to 27,000 bales. According to records, Whicomb sold 1,150 bales, Gin Chong 800 bales, Shen Kee 600 bales, Gee Foong 450 bales, Dah Foong 800 bales, Yuen Dah 600 bales, and Yuen Tai 400 bales. Sin Chong bought 1,300 bales, Cheung Yu 550 bales, Tung Fu 600 bales, Ming Teh 500 bales, Yan Foong 800 bales, Teh Kee 650 bales, and Dah Cheung 400 bales.

<p>Fujian: 4, Ningbo: 20, Yunnan: 380, Guangdong: 95, Tianjin: 600</p>
<h3>Prices of Cotton for All Months Hit New Highs</h3>
<p>The cotton market is strengthening with increasing momentum. Buyers are resolutely anticipating a shortage of old cotton. As a result, the market is tightening and prices are rising sharply, with each month reaching new highs. In the afternoon, a certain firm was found to be shipping three to four thousand dan of cotton that failed inspection due to excessive moisture and was rejected. This further fueled price increases as firms covered their positions in the market.</p>
<p>(Marked Cotton Up 6.5 Cents) The marked cotton market opened with stable foreign cotton prices. However, a lack of sellers led short sellers to cover their positions, pushing prices up by 3-4 cents for each month. The market remained firm in the afternoon, with prices rising another 2-3 cents. Total transactions for the day amounted to 118,000 dan. According to records, Yuen Dah sold 4,400 dan, Geng Foong Gu 1,100 dan, Shen Chong 1,400 dan, Tung Wo 2,600 dan, Rui Yuen 4,000 dan, Dah Fu 2,400 dan, Whicomb 6,800 dan, Dah Chong Cheng 1,800 dan, and Cheung Wo 3,500 dan. Yu Kee bought 7,700 dan, Dah Fu 2,000 dan, Dah Foong 2,900 dan, Yu Dah 2,700 dan, Xin Wah 2,100 dan, Yan Foong 2,000 dan, Geng Foong 2,800 dan, Yuen Tai 2,200 dan, Hip Sang 2,700 dan, Teh Kee 1,800 dan, and Sin Chong 1,700 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Total: 652,900</p>
<p>(Continuous Demand from Raw Cotton Mills) Spot cotton sales remain good, with increased demand from Chinese mills. Sourcing includes 350 bales of Yao cotton and 701 bales of Tong cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton: 41.75 - 42.00, Heng Foong Mill took in 1,000 bales of spot goods for delivery to the mill.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Up 4-5 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market initially fell due to pressure from sellers. However, it rebounded due to short covering and buying by Japanese merchants. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 points and futures prices rose by 4-5 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices initially fell due to profit-taking, but recovered slightly due to short covering. The futures market remained unchanged for both Bengal and Omra. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 7.5 cents for White Luo Creek. (Telegram of the 10th)</p>

<h3>Flour Futures Market Shows Increased Activity</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a steady trend after opening in the morning. Foreign wheat prices had sharply increased, with Chicago up by $1.65 and Canada up by $1.89. This stabilized market sentiment and prices were raised slightly upon opening. However, due to the continuing economic downturn and limited activity in the north, price increases were minimal. In the afternoon, the market remained flat, but speculative activity increased, with some short covering. Prices gradually improved. Factories did not sell much, with major factories trading only 20,000-30,000 bags. Given the current purchasing power, this still felt weak. With the new wheat harvest approaching, the frequent increases in foreign prices were unlikely to have a significant impact. As a result, the price for the current month increased by 2 cents from the previous day, June increased by 2 cents, July increased by 1.5 cents, August increased by 2.75 cents, September increased by 2.5 cents, and October increased by 2.7 cents.</p>
<h3>Rice Futures Up 6-7 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice futures market was calm and normal in the morning. Foreign wheat prices were up by about $1.67-1.89. However, with the market feeling good and rice still available, buyers showed little interest. Prices remained largely unchanged upon opening. In the afternoon, the flour market showed a positive trend and sellers were reluctant to sell at reduced prices. Prices were raised upon opening, and trading was brisk. This trend was driven by foreign wheat prices. The future direction depends on both the weather and prices. As a result, June futures increased by 7 cents, July increased by 6 cents, and August increased by 6 cents. There were no comparisons for other months. The spot rice market saw brisk trading with stable prices. Kai Dangshan wheat was priced at 3 dollars, with the next grade at 2.98 dollars. Xuzhou wheat was priced at 2.95 dollars, with the next grade at 9 cents. Shandong wheat was priced at 3 dollars. Wuhe wheat was priced at 2.88 dollars. Yao Wan wheat was priced at 2.95 dollars, with the next grade at 9 cents. Fuxin purchased an estimated 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Shows a Hint of Improvement</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) The supply of refined rice was similar to yesterday, totaling over 40 firms (more than 6,000 stones). Thick and thin Japonica rice each accounted for half. Demand was more active than yesterday. The initial market continued to decline slightly, with lingering effects from the previous day. Around noon, customers arrived in a steady stream, gradually tightening the market. Buyers from the Nanyang gang did not make any purchases of late rice, while buyers from the Beiyang gang showed strong interest, purchasing nearly 3,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, and Chonggu rice. The late rice market rebounded by 2-3 cents. The various thick Japonica rice followed suit, and shops were able to operate smoothly again, suddenly reversing the market's softness. However, prices did not show significant improvement. Duyang pointed rice remained stable, while Yinbian rice still showed some freshness.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>(Hu Bei) Over 20 boats arrived from towns and villages along the river. Various types of rice in the market, including polished Japonica, Bianyuan, and Yangjian, were relatively active. Dujian, Kejian, and thin rice saw some trading. Bujian and Shiqiao slightly softened. The market saw high-quality polished Japonica rice remain firm, with medium and lower grades increasing by nearly 1 jiao, or even 5-6 fen. Bianyuan rice was scarce, with prices increasing by around 1 jiao. Yangjian, Dujian, thin rice, and Kejian rice prices remained stable, while Bujian rice showed a slightly softer trend.</p>
<h3>Upland Indica Rice Arrived Very Strong, Machine Yuan Rice Increased by 1 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s upland indica rice and rough rice market saw active demand, especially from the Fuzhou gang, which continued to buy aggressively. A total of 5,420 bags of various indica rice were sold in the city, with the Fuzhou gang purchasing more than half. Local merchants and those from the interior were also quite active. However, there have been many arrivals in recent days, especially yesterday, with nearly 10,000 bags arriving from Hunan, Shashi, and Jiangbei via train. Hunan rough oil rice accounted for more than 5,000 bags, and other goods will arrive in the coming days. Therefore, although the market for upland indica rice is active, prices for high-quality rice have stabilized, while medium and lower grades have fallen by 2-3 fen. There has been little arrival and stock of upland yuan rice recently, and with little Dujian yuan rice remaining in the factories along the river and strong demand from local merchants, local merchants purchased 500 bags of Wuxi machine yuan rice yesterday. Although the quality of the goods was not particularly high, prices were quoted at 10 yuan, with medium and lower grades at 9.82-9.7 jiao, and Xiang machine yuan rice as low as 9.1-9.2 jiao, all more than 2 jiao higher than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: National Chaoqing Sugar Rises Another 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a strengthening trend as both customs gold and standard gold rebounded. The association set the price of No. 24 coarse white sugar at 10.9 yuan on the open market the day before, but it was not completed. Yesterday, it was released and was 1 jiao higher than the 9th. Transshipment goods No. 6889 Dutch red ordinary goods were marked at 15.85 yuan, and high-quality goods were marked at 16.5 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B mark was still marked at 21 yuan, and Zhen Kee No. 1 white sugar was marked at 19.4 jiao. Deals were made at the original price. Chaoqing sugar remained tight and in good condition, with few lots being released, for a total of only 400+ bags, up another 2 jiao from the day before. Premium Zhuang Qing opened at 12 yuan, followed by 11.9 jiao for the next grade, Huanggang Qing at 11.8 jiao, and ordinary Jieyang Qing at 11.3 jiao. Brick green sugar has been sluggish for a long time, but with Qing sugar becoming more active recently, over 100 bags were released yesterday, priced at 8.2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Head Oil Market Sees Resurgence in Price Hikes</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market, which had fallen slightly the day before yesterday, saw a resurgence in price increases yesterday due to rising production costs and telegraphic transfers, as well as active sales in the market. Prices increased by 1-2 jiao compared to the previous market. Yesterday, the total volume of transactions in the morning and afternoon was 50 pieces of ship-delivered spot Niuzhuang oil, priced at 10.04 yuan, 200 pieces of road-delivered oil, priced at 10.05 yuan, 200 pieces of ship-delivered Dalian oil, priced at 10.015 yuan, 110 pieces of sand boat-delivered Dalian Qishan oil, priced at 9.9 yuan, 200 pieces of ship-delivered goods, priced at 9.85 yuan, and 200 pieces of ship-delivered Shahe Qishan oil, priced at 9.6 and 7 jiao. Peanut oil was relatively stagnant. Although demand existed, supplies were plentiful, and market prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Late Spring Silkworm Development in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Yuyao) Farmers are raising spring silkworms this year, including Hangzhou, Zhuji, and native breeds. Many in Linxi Township, Tianyuan City, Henghe Town, and other places are hatching foreign breeds. However, the weather has been erratic, with frequent changes. Most native breed silkworms in the second and third sleep stages have been discarded, especially due to the recent hot and cold snaps. Early batches of foreign breeds are already in the major sleep stage, while later batches are still in the third sleep stage. Recently, the temperature has remained low, and farmers are using fire to supplement the temperature for the silkworms. Their appetite is not strong, and development is not going smoothly.</p>
<p>(Fenghua) Farmers are hatching silkworms late this year due to the cold weather and late sprouting of mulberry trees. Some in Puwangmiao, Jiangkou Town, Xixi, Weijiazhuang, and other places are hatching native breeds, but the silkworms are not uniform. Those raising improved breeds are about 5-6 days later than the native breeds. After the leaves sprouted, the cold and rainy weather has been unfavorable for the silkworms. Native breed silkworms in the second and third sleep stages have suffered disease and losses of about 60%. Improved breed silkworms are currently in the major sleep stage, but the weather remains cold and they are unable to wake up.</p>
<p>(Taixian) Many farmers in various villages are hatching their own native breeds. The highest volume is in Dasizhuang, Huai'an, Shuanggou, and other places. The number of silkworms raised in Jiangnian and Majiabu has decreased. After the leaves sprouted, the weather was suddenly cold and hot, with continuous rainy days. Silkworms in the second sleep stage were found to be suffering from yellowing, black vomit, and rotting, with 30-40% dying. Currently, the improved breed silkworms are in the third sleep stage, but the weather remains cold, causing sluggishness and loss of sleep. Their current condition is not good.</p>
<p>(Hushu) In the Hushu area of Hangzhou, farmers are hatching native breeds for economic reasons, accounting for 40-50% of the total. However, the weather has been continuously rainy and cloudy, causing changes in the second and third sleep stages. Improved breeds are developing slowly, with only sluggishness and loss of sleep. In recent days, the weather has been initially hot, followed by a sudden cold snap, with a temperature difference of 30-40 degrees within two days, and thunderstorms. This has caused most of the native breed silkworms to suffer from yellowing, black vomit, and significant mortality. Improved breed silkworms are also slow-moving, eating less, and showing symptoms such as empty heads and white stiff disease.</p>
<p>(Baima) In Baima, Xinfeng, and other places in Jiaxing, many are raising improved breeds. However, the cold weather has caused mulberry trees to sprout late, and silkworms are not hatching uniformly. After waking from sleep, the weather is suddenly cold and hot, with continuous rainy days, which has greatly affected the silkworms' development. Silkworm sleep is delayed. Early batches are just in the third sleep stage, while later batches are only in the second sleep stage and eating well. However, in recent days, the weather has changed dramatically, and most silkworms are stiff and unable to wake up. Some cases of black and rotten silkworms have been found. Mulberry leaves are cheap, costing two dan per yuan. There is no market for the leaves.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Market Trading Slow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw slow trading. The Wenzhou black and green tea from the current supply channel has almost completely sold out. Although some new goods from local firms have been listed, foreign firms are demanding very tight prices. Yesterday, the entire city only saw Jinlong Foreign Firm open 22 boxes of Yunya Zhenmei tea, with a price of 80 yuan. The rest were goods agreed upon the day before. According to general tea merchants, there have been no recent departures of French postal ships, and the green tea market does not seem to have any hope of progress.</p>

<h3>A Novel Detection Circuit</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes are used as detectors, mainly in two ways: plate detection and grid detection. The principle is to make the input high-frequency current unidirectional after detection, so detection can also be said to be the rectification of high-frequency current. Although the detection circuit described in this article is also based on the principle of rectification, the circuit is unique and completely different from the above two methods. Readers may be seeing it for the first time, and this type of circuit has already been adopted in newly released radios, so it should be introduced urgently.</p>
<p>This new detection circuit has three distinctive features: 1. A single detection stage contains two triodes. The first tube makes the input high-frequency current only flow in one direction to complete the detection purpose, so it is called a detector rectifier; the second tube amplifies the weak audio frequency oscillating voltage X after rectification, and feeds it to the audio frequency amplification stage, so it is called a detector amplifier. 2. The signal output is not connected to the plate circuit as in ordinary vacuum tube circuits, but is connected to the ground wire in the grid circuit. 3. No positive voltage is applied to the plate, but it is connected to the cathode and grounded.</p>
<h3>Figure One</h3>
<p>To illustrate the function of this detection circuit, refer to Figure 1A, which is a simple half-wave rectifier. If S represents the secondary of a high-frequency transformer, it can also be regarded as a half-wave or bipolar detector. One end of the secondary S is connected to the plate, and the other end is connected to the filament via a resistor R. When S receives a high-frequency signal voltage, in the positive half cycle, the plate attracts electrons and a current flows through R. There is no plate current flow in the negative half cycle, so it is completely a half-wave rectification.</p>
<p>Refer again to Figure 1B. The plate and cathode of this triode are connected to the ground wire, so it coincides with end 2 of the filament of Figure 1A. Lead 1 of Figure 1B is also completely the same as lead I of the plate of Figure 1A. The difference is that in this circuit, the grid of the vacuum tube is used as the plate, and the plate is connected to the cathode to reduce the internal resistance of the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>[PＩ&gt;</p>
<h3>Figure Two</h3>
<p>ＩP]</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the circuit after the combination of the detector rectifier and the detector amplifier. A closer look at this circuit reveals that it is a resistance-coupled amplifier. The so-called detection amplification stage is nothing more than a preamplifier for the audio frequency stage. Its operating principle is exactly the same as that of a normal amplifier, so it will not be discussed further.</p>
<p>Using this detection method, when the amplitude modulation of an external signal increases, its audio frequency output can also increase in direct proportion, which is its unique advantage and difficult to achieve with other detection methods.</p>
<p>If you want to connect a pickup or microphone in this circuit, it can be connected at the X symbol in Figure 2.</p>
<h3>Ultra-Shortwave Oscillation Using Diodes</h3>
<p>— Bo Qing</p>
<p>The oscillation of ultra-short waves has always been mainly achieved using triodes, magnetrons, etc. However, recently a simple method of oscillating ultra-short waves using a special structure of diodes has been discovered.</p>
<p>This diode, as the name implies, does not have a grid, and is exactly the same as a magnetron, and does not require a strong magnetic field to be applied from the outside, that is, the simpler it is, the better the oscillation efficiency.</p>
<p>The structure of this diode, B, is slightly different from the past. Its center has a tungsten wire anode with a diameter of 1 hao (1 mm), which is used as an axis, and four cathodes are arranged inside a cylindrical surface with a diameter of 12.5 hao (12.5 mm). The electrons emitted from the cathode cannot be completely absorbed because the anode is extremely thin, and a part of it passes through the side of the anode due to inertia, causing it to be re-attracted by the anode and generate movement. As a result, electrons around the anode oscillate.</p>
<p>The connection situation is shown in the second figure, A and B.</p>
<h3>Figure One Figure Two</h3>
<p>Are parallel lines spaced 2 centimeters apart, C is a variable capacitor with a maximum capacity of about 10 pico farads, and D is a circular copper plate with a diameter of 30 centimeters, and A and B pass through it.</p>
<p>Therefore, as usual, no plate choke is used, only a choke is inserted on the filament side. The normal output is about 25 milliamps in the belly of a 50-centimeter antenna.</p>
<p>When the plate voltage is at 360 volts, a wavelength of about 1.5 meters can be obtained. Moving the circular plate along AB, or changing the capacitance, can also change the oscillation wavelength within a considerable range. If the D plate is close to the vacuum tube, the wavelength can be shortened, but if it is too close, the oscillation will stop.</p>
<p>According to the connection in the second figure, the influence of the oscillation wavelength is checked by using the change of external constants. As shown in the figure, the length of the parallel line can be freely changed, and the oscillation state of the C capacitor is adjusted to the most appropriate state, and then it is fixed, and only the length of the anode is changed, then the following wavelengths can be obtained:</p>
<p>E Wavelength Anode Voltage</p>
<p>08 cm 94 cm 600 volts</p>
<p>10 cm 102 cm 600 volts</p>
<p>12 cm 106 cm 600 volts</p>
<p>15 cm 118 cm 600 volts</p>
<p>If the same connection is used, and the anode voltage is changed from 560 volts to 540 volts, the wavelength is almost fixed at 140 cm, but the output is considered to change according to the anode voltage. However, limited to a certain anode voltage, or a certain specific wavelength, the maximum output can be obtained. According to the calculation, the period corresponding to the wavelength with the maximum output is approximately equal to three times the time required for the electron to be emitted from the filament to the anode.</p>
<h3>New Pocket Radio</h3>
<p>— Si Lian</p>
<p>In order to reduce the number of vacuum tubes, Americans are actively researching and have come up with reflex radios. However, they are dissatisfied with the volume and installation, so compound vacuum tubes have now appeared. Ban Jie and the author have recorded it in the previous issue.</p>
<p>The latest pocket radio in the United States uses this. The previous issue’s draft briefly mentioned it. This pocket radio is less than 6 inches high, about 4.5 inches wide, and more than 2 inches thick. It has a beautiful color and weighs about 2 pounds. The tuning dial is placed on top, the speaker is in the middle, and the volume controller and switch are below. The circuit is shown in the figure below.</p>
<p>The vacuum tubes used are two Keller brand. The speaker is a magnetic type with a small diameter.</p>
<p>The dual-gang variable capacitor in the figure is quite special in manufacturing. The remaining capacitors and resistors are extremely small. This machine uses a pentode for high-frequency amplification and a triode for detection. It also uses the reflex method to feed back to the pentode as the first stage of low-frequency amplification and input. The pentode is also used as the second stage of power amplification, so the volume is loud. The 21A7 is a combination tube for rectification and a pentode, so although it is called a two-tube machine, its volume can actually exceed a five-tube machine. This machine can receive local and central radio stations without using a ground wire, and can get good results. Its loudness is really the super-super in two-tube machines.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>(Continuation 2) Contribution from Philips</p>
<p>(3) The Era of Development: Since then, the development of vacuum tubes has been changing with each passing day. The E415 tube was developed to meet the needs of the times. It is used for special detection and audio frequency amplification, replacing the E409 tube. At the same time, the high-frequency screen grid tube E442 and the power pentode B443 also came out one after another. Up to now, A442, A415, and B443 are still popular among amateur enthusiasts and are considered to be a perfect set of vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>(4) New Trends: Today, AC radios are popular in the world. Most radios use AC power, but in the past, supplying AC power to radios was a difficult problem that could not be solved. If you supply AC power with a frequency of 50 Hz to the radio, it will emit the so-called AC sound, which interferes with the radio. It is quite difficult to eliminate this AC sound. After the emergence of AC vacuum tubes, the previous difficulties have been completely resolved. In AC vacuum tubes, in addition to the filament, there is another cathode dedicated to electron emission, and the filament only serves to heat and has no function of emitting electrons, which is quite different from the old-fashioned tubes. With the advent of AC tubes, almost all of the previous DC radios have been eliminated, transforming into today's era of AC radio. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Shanghai Heming Broadcasting Station is known for promoting getting up early. The radio features lectures and storytelling in the dawn hours, which was initiated by this station. From May 8th, Hong Lou Meng will be broadcast every morning from 7:30 to 8:30, lectured by Mr. Wang Wenbin, the owner of the station, at a frequency of 1440. Please pay attention.</p>

<h3>Internal and External News</h3>
<p>The Wheeler Company on Nanjing Road is currently closing down. All of its large stock of unrepaired radios have been completely sent to the Great Shanghai Wireless Electric Company at No. 49 Nanjing Road, near the intersection of Sichuan Road, for repair, in order to promptly return them to customers. This demonstrates the company's thoroughness. Even in the midst of closing, it still wants to ensure that customers continue to receive reliable and satisfactory service. The closure of Wheeler Company is regrettable news for the radio industry. Customers who previously entrusted their radios to Wheeler for repair can now send them directly to the Great Shanghai Wireless Electric Company to avoid detours. The company's telephone number is 14996.</p>
<p>The American Radio Corporation recently introduced the Steadward radio, managed by the American Radio Corporation, which features robust components and long-distance reception and has already achieved exceptional results. Its special feature is that it can receive signals freely and easily even during the intense heat of summer, without any difficulty, and is unobstructed during the rainy season. The price is very affordable, so sales are high, making it the top-selling radio on the market. The company also carries Sandel-Weld vacuum tubes. These tubes are produced by a famous American factory, are exceptionally high quality, energy-saving, and durable. If your radio's reception is not clear, it is essential to have one.</p>
<p>The Tian Er Wireless Electric Company, located at No. 35 Renji Road, is a giant in radio repair. Currently, during the rainy season, it is expanding its business and has specially hired more than ten experienced technicians who work day and night. All repairs can be completed within 48 hours, which is extremely fast. It is reported that the company has recently expanded its sound department and can now handle sound pickup for various film companies. Film companies are advised to take note of this. If you need sound pickup services, you can contact the company directly. The company is currently managing the Zenith brand radio, which is of excellent quality and can be considered a top-grade product. Those who do not yet own a radio should try listening to it.</p>
<p>Special News on Radio Repair: The pioneer in specialized radio repair in this city is the Yada Company at No. 24 Nanjing Road. Adhering to the principle of serving society, the company was the first to promote free inspection and publicly reveal the secrets of radio. Now, this trend has become widespread in Shanghai, providing radio users with unparalleled convenience. It cannot be denied that this is due to the company's advocacy. It is reported that several major companies and a certain Western association have special repair agreements with the company for all their radios. This not only satisfies customers but also saves themselves trouble. Radio stores that find repairs difficult may well follow suit.</p>

<h3>Low Prices and Free Gifts</h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>The fairest trade in the world is naturally "getting two parts of goods for one part of the price." However, in Shanghai, it is not like this, at least it is "getting more than one part of goods for one part of the price." If readers stop and take a look on some busy streets, the most common sight is, of course, the big sales in various large and small shops. And it's like they're taught by the same master, all uniformly pasting white paper on the transparent and sparkling large glass display windows, writing red slogans like "regardless of the cost," "serious sacrifice," "special discount," and "selling cheap at a loss" as if written in the blood of Lao Quan, in various styles, quite interesting.</p>
<p>In addition to such grandstanding, some even specify how cheap they are. Thus, from "10% off," "20% off," all the way to "50% off" and "buy one get one free," and even from "buy one get one free" to "buy one get two free," and from "buy one get two free" to "original price of one dollar, reduced to ninety cents." Obviously, "one part of the price for one part of the goods" is simply not true, "one-tenth of the price for one part of the goods" is a little more like it.</p>
<p>"Original price of one dollar, reduced to ninety cents," pushing the cart against the wall, reducing prices even further becomes a bit ridiculous. Then, there is a change of strategy, playing the game of "free gifts."</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to "original price of one dollar, reduced to ninety cents," there is also "giving away valuable gifts to reward the patronage." If it is an old Quan's shop with generous hands, it will even generously give away a floor-standing vacuum tube forty-nine-bulb radio, or a ticket for the aviation highway construction prize worth fifty million yuan. This sets a new record for low prices and free gifts in the world. Exactly "how many parts of goods" you can get for "one part of the price," we should ask an experienced and wealthy accountant to calculate.</p>
<p>Such low prices and free gifts are honest to both young and old. Even those European, American, and Japanese merchants who are good at dumping goods would stick their tongues out half a foot, admitting their inferiority.</p>
<h3>Teahouse</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon, I had nothing to do, and it was drizzling. It seemed inconvenient to stroll on the streets, so I decided to go to a teahouse to "incubate bean sprouts."</p>
<p>This was the first time in my life that I had gone to a teahouse. After I sat down, the waiter brought the tea. Strangely, I found a lot of sesame-like things in the teacup. I quickly called the waiter. It was said that this was what was left from the bird tea drunk in the morning. Hearing this, I understood everything. I realized that bird food could be used as a beverage.</p>
<p>After drinking a mouthful of birdseed tea, Zhang Tiekou, a fortune-teller and friend, suddenly nodded and swayed, asking me how old I was. He stretched out his chicken claw-like hand, calculated the yin and yang for a while, and said that I would become very rich and noble in three years. After he finished, I gave him twelve copper coins and thanked him. Afterwards, I regretted it. I should have waited until I became rich and noble before giving him money.</p>
<p>Then, more than a dozen men in blue short shirts and pants, wearing caps at an angle, came in. I was startled, thinking they were the "eat-speak tea" people as the common saying goes. I hurriedly inquired to the waiter, who said they were here to bid for a rotating credit association. Only then did I put down a stone in my heart.</p>
<p>Several men were busy secretly writing bids and pressing them on the table. After a while, the bidding began. "Three dollars and fifty cents," "three dollars, five jiao, one and a half cents," "three dollars, six jiao, three and a half cents"—everyone made a fuss for a while. For some reason, they disagreed, and a fat man grabbed a long-legged man and started fighting. A small companion pulled out a sharp axe from his side.</p>
<p>Seeing that something was wrong, I didn't even have time to pay for the tea and slipped away in the chaos.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop</h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>It's easy to pawn things, but it's hard to redeem them.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty of redeeming, I have repeatedly vowed never to go to the pawnshop again, but my personal economic circumstances have never allowed me to keep that vow. What can I do? Just pawn it. As Lu Fangweng said, "It is not poverty if there are clothes to pawn." It is truly the end of the road when there is nothing left to pawn!</p>
<p>Although the things I have pawned before are already very worthless.</p>
<p>After being rejected by relatives and friends, I silently came back to check my belongings. Wool sweaters, scarves, and old cotton robes would do, as long as the "shopkeeper" doesn't refuse. I don't care whether it's pawned for much or little. If I pawn it for less, it will be easier to redeem. If I have money, there's no need to pawn anything. It's only when I'm extremely poor that I have a reason to redeem them. Because I have judged that I no longer have the ability to realize that dream of making something new.</p>
<p>I am very experienced in pawning things. While others are arguing and quarreling with the "shopkeeper," I have already taken a pawn ticket and several silver dollars and slipped out. Indeed, the "shopkeeper's" face is ugly, but we have things to pawn for money, and we are really justified. I feel that it is better to go to the pawnshop and see the "shopkeeper's" face than to be sneered at by relatives and friends.</p>
<p>In exploiting the poor, pawnshops are undoubtedly our enemies. But in the sense that they can help in emergencies at any time, pawnshops seem to be our benefactors again.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Paper Shop</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>The term "tobacco and paper shop" seems to be familiar only to people in Shanghai. The reason is that in the metropolis, the sale of cigarettes has become a daily consumable for almost every man and woman. Therefore, tobacco and paper shops have not yet had the qualifications to gain a foothold in other cities. In Shanghai, there are traces of them on every road, even in every alley. Although their business success and organizational size are different, they are all called tobacco and paper shops. There is no clear class distinction. No one looks down on them, saying, "This is a big company, this is a small stall." Their main business is not as reliant on selling cigarettes as they claim. The profit from currency exchange is no less than that from cigarettes. Shanghai is full of vehicles speeding around, and there are crowds of people surging everywhere, struggling for their livelihoods. Therefore, although all industries in Shanghai are in an extreme state of depression, every vehicle is indeed overcrowded with passengers! Everyone hates the bulkiness of copper coins. The exchange of silver coins for small coins, and small coins for copper coins, has become the central business of tobacco and paper shops, and also an important element in the increasing number of tobacco and paper shops. Other items such as kerosene, matches, toilet paper, and stamps are their secondary businesses. Their employees are very poor. They have to get up at six in the morning and usually "close" at ten o'clock at night, working a full sixteen hours. After closing, the small window is still open for business as usual. They finally get to rest at twelve o'clock. It is said that their monthly income is only about ten dollars. They have the same responsibility of supporting their families. They also need to treat customers who buy two cigarettes for three copper coins politely. They are just like the waiters in teahouses, "traveling thousands of miles without leaving their homes." Among them, there are also women who can truly "rely on their own efforts," and they are the "bosses" of husband-and-wife tobacco and paper shops.</p>
<h3>The Color, Aroma, and Taste of Soochow</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Soochow University has been full of spring these days. The spring atmosphere is rich and fragrant, forming a beautiful color, aroma, and taste.</p>
<p>The middle school students' calligraphy and painting research association, which has only two years of history, exhibited its works and held a flower arrangement exhibition a few days ago. Therefore, when we stepped into the forest hall, which resembled an ancient villa, we felt that beauty and fragrance were intertwined into infinite spring light, giving us an incredible pleasure. In the four rooms, we saw calligraphy and paintings on the walls, including landscapes, figures, and flowers, all of which were delightful. Even the stone drum inscriptions and Yan and Liu-style calligraphy were copied with great effort. It is not easy for young people under the age of twenty to achieve such good results. Surrounding us were Chinese flowers and foreign flowers, as if the painter's sketch box had been overturned, with all kinds of colors, making it a feast for the eyes. Deep in the flowers, there were also several cages hanging, filled with sunflowers, hibiscus, and embroidered eyes, constantly singing the self-composed melody of nature, which was really flavorful!</p>
<p>The light in the forest hall was particularly dim. Because it was dim, it was even quieter. A lively university suddenly changed at this time, all entering a state of tranquility and indifference, giving hundreds of students a little adjustment in their lives and environment, which was quite interesting. Not only that, but there was also adjustment on the grassy ground near the river.</p>
<h3>Early Display, Late Roll-Up</h3>
<p>— Moni</p>
<p>My friend recently opened a southern goods store. Because the price of housing in Shanghai is expensive, he only rented one and a half rooms. The front room is used as a store, and the half room in the back is used to store goods. The place is so small, and there are six employees in total. I said to my friend, "The place is so small, I'm afraid the accommodation problem will be difficult to solve." The friend nodded and said, "Yes! We can only display the bedding early and roll it up late in the store." I listened and was very puzzled. How could they display bedding in the store in the morning and still do business? This sentence is a proverb, and can only be taken as a joke.</p>
<p>But I thought that the four words "early display, late roll-up" were not very clear. After spending half a day thinking, I finally figured it out. Originally, it could only be said to the tailors that they "display early, roll up late," because the tailors sleep on the tables. When they work in the morning, they spread out the clothes. At night, they roll them up, put them away and set up their bedding to sleep. Thinking like this, it felt appropriate. Now, people's stores are small, so they sleep on the floor, and they call it "early display, late roll-up," which is really wonderful.</p>
<h3>Opening and Closing Shops</h3>
<p>— Weijing</p>
<p>In Shanghai, no matter what it is, there is some mystery to it. Even more so, new shops hold grand openings, and old shops that have been in business for decades hold closing sales, attracting customers from far and wide, packing the stores so densely that the stone counters are crowded within three feet.</p>
<p>I remember that two months ago, a southern goods store opened on a certain road. A week before the opening, the city was already buzzing with rumors that the southern goods store would sell a lot of cheap goods at its opening. Therefore, although the southern goods store was scheduled to open at eight o'clock in the morning, around six-thirty, seventy or eighty people were already waiting at the door. Those squeezed in the innermost layer had smiles on their faces. Even those standing in the outermost layer, watching those who came later squeeze behind them, also showed arrogant smiles.</p>
<p>More and more people gathered, pushing and shoving each other, almost starting a fight. Then, amidst a burst of firecrackers, the southern goods store opened half an hour early. One dollar for a ham, cheap. One dollar for eight pounds of white sugar, probably selling at a loss. Customers, with banknotes and silver dollars clipped in their fingers, desperately sent them to the counter, but the clerks still pretended to owe them too much, yelling. The customers were really swallowing their anger and didn't care.</p>
<p>Also, last year, an old-brand silk shop closed down on a certain road. One day, it suddenly announced a clearance sale. It was unbelievable. It closed the front door and opened a back door. In less than an hour, the upstairs and downstairs were packed with customers, so it simply closed the back door as well. However, customers who kept coming and couldn't get in still lingered at the door for two or three hours without getting tired. Some even went home for dinner and then came back to wait, without any complaints.</p>
<p>It is natural for customers to flock to a shop's opening. Business failure, and a clearance sale, can actually attract customers, which is a bit unbelievable.</p>
<h3>Teahouse Sketch: On the Top Floor of the Deyilou Teahouse</h3>
<p>— Xiatianwu</p>
<p>Uncle Si Quan, with rolled-up sleeves, holding a birdcage as brilliant as gold thread, climbed up to the third floor of the Deyilou Teahouse.</p>
<p>"Uncle Si! Why haven't you been here for three days in a row? Yesterday, old man Yuan Kun said: Xu's old nanny is playing tricks on you for no reason, isn't she?" Gui Sheng, the waiter, wiped the table with a cloth he took off his shoulder and pulled a chair from the side of the partition.</p>
<p>"Fate! The world is getting more and more wrong. The weather is dry and hot. I have never offended anyone, but I don't know which son of a bitch is spreading rumors about me." Uncle Si Quan put the birdcage on the table as if he were very angry, stuck his hips out backward, and slowly sat down.</p>
<p>"The world is wrong. One has to eat one's fill all day long and chew on empty maggots. There are so many people like that." Mr. Qiu, who was usually the most talkative person here, sat on the other side of the table, creasing his two nasolabial folds into a half-smile as he responded to Uncle Si's words.</p>
<p>Gui Sheng had already brought up the water pipe. "Uncle Si! Have a smoke first, to calm your anger."</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu, impatient, asked first:</p>
<p>"Uncle Si! What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Alas! It's not my son, I have not even been looking for it. I don't know which ghost said that one day he saw me and the eldest daughter of old Mrs. Xu in the Wing On Company. Old Mrs. Xu said: I often smile at her daughter with infatuation, which is not a good thing. The day before yesterday, she came to me for no reason to stir things up. Do you think this is not annoying?"</p>
<p>"Ah yo! Why do you care so much about such a thing? Qing is Qing, Bai is Bai. If one has money, which place doesn't have young ladies? Such a trivial matter is not worth getting upset about."</p>
<p>"That's not how it is. I'm angry that she's too 'holding' people. She even thought of coming to my face to ask for 0.3 percent. I'm not the kind of person who takes on this dirty title."</p>
<p>"Yes, Uncle Si is originally an upright person. Every day he drinks a cup of tea and plays with his birds. It's intolerable to have people forcibly 'holding' him on to other topics."</p>
<p>Uncle Si Quan seemed to be defending himself and changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Has the head of the firewood guild reached the tenth episode of The Water Margin?"</p>
<p>"It's already passed, already passed. It's been wonderful for three days in a row. Old man Guo is really energetic. It can also be said that he's getting fresher as he gets older. Especially the colors in that section are well done."</p>
<p>"That section? Is it bloody?"</p>
<p>"It's that section. Wang Po received money from Ximen Qing, and she did her best to do the matchmaking. The five-character secret is spoken fluently. The hookup between Ximen Qing and Pan Jinlian is so vivid that everyone who listens is fascinated!"</p>
<p>"Then why didn't you ask me?" Uncle Si Quan seemed very disappointed.</p>
<p>"Uncle Si likes to listen to romantic stories. I was careless and caused you to lose money."</p>
<p>Uncle Si Quan laughed loudly, splashing the water in the cage all over the table.</p>
<p>Let's taste the taste of sports after we finish the quiet enjoyment.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that these three grand events were opened on the first day of the New Life Movement in Suzhou, which gives us an insinuation: "Their new life begins!"</p>

<h3>Notes of a Sick Prisoner</h3>
<p>— Xiaolong</p>
<p>(V) The Torment of Not Being Allowed to Groan</p>
<p>After the surgery was completed, three nurses of different nationalities—American, Chinese, and Japanese—pushed my hospital bed into the elevator and up to our ward on the fourth floor. Then they moved me to my bed.</p>
<p>The sunlight gradually dimmed. Due to the regulations of the hospital, Lan, who had come with me, had to leave. I was left alone, lying on this unfamiliar bed, among several unfamiliar fellow patients. The air was filled with a sense of desolation in the silence.</p>
<p>The effect of the anesthetic gradually wore off, and the wound in my throat gradually became more painful. I tried my best to endure it. The feeling of pain seems to be more acute when one is lonely. The doctor did not allow me to put my head on the pillow, so the blood constantly flowed into my nasal passages, which made me very uncomfortable. Although breathing was a little more comfortable at this time, because the blood seeped out, I had to spit it out from time to time, which was even more uncomfortable than the shortness of breath.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened. The lights in the room also turned on. It was not until after seven o'clock, when the hospital regulations allowed family members to visit patients, that Lan came. Although I could not speak, I felt happy in my heart. The pain in the wound also seemed to be reduced.</p>
<p>Happy times are the shortest. After the clock struck eight, Lan had to leave again. I had to be left here again, spending this painful, long night.</p>
<p>I was tormented by pain all night long. Blood seeped out of the wound and stayed in my throat. You can't help but spit it out. But every time you cough, because you twitch the wound in your throat, you feel great pain. I used all my methods to shift my attention to other thoughts, to forget my pain, but when the pain was severe, it pulled my attention back. My wound was also in my throat, which was no different from a kind of cruel punishment that did not allow groaning, shouting, or making a sound. In this way, I could only silently, persistently, and all night long fight with pain, until dawn was breaking, and just as I was about to fall asleep faintly, a mercury thermometer was inserted into my mouth, and my hand was pulled out of the warm blanket to take my pulse. So I was awakened again by the nurse's examination.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of the Times</h3>
<p>— Yuanju</p>
<p>In ancient times, there were many famous scholars, especially in the Six Dynasties, who felt that there was only themselves in the world, and no one else. They looked down on the etiquette of the day, broke all the customary ethics, or rolled their eyes at people, thinking that they had deep meaning; or they indulged in wine and willfulness, getting drunk for sixty days—becoming a so-called "celebrity style."</p>
<p>But we, the people who read history, only read the history that has words. Historians are mostly limited to the intellectual class, and only confined to the lives of intellectuals. Therefore, the lives of several other layers of society have not been recorded. Moreover, apart from a few folk legends, the so-called history has been buried by the times.</p>
<p>"Celebrity style" is a kind of "reactionary thought," a manifestation of dissatisfaction with the society of the day, a kind of injustice—but this is limited to a few scholars, most of whom are thinkers who can speak but cannot act, the typical of those who "are not diligent day and night, but say that they travel too much," are "Confucians."</p>
<p>Is social injustice only felt and revealed by a few sensitive Confucians? Apart from a few literati, don't people of other classes feel it?—Yes, they do. The "chivalry" of warriors and the "mysticism" of Buddhism and Taoism can all be counted in this category.</p>
<p>People in the time of the Three Emperors and Five Emperors did not like immortals (there probably were no "Kalachakra dharma assemblies" at that time), and the people were spiritually happier than they are today, the struggle for survival was more barbaric and straightforward, but it should also be more benevolent. By the time society became more complex, and the shackles on humanity tightened, there were people who "abandoned their families to practice Taoism" and "entered the mountains to become thieves." But whether they left the world or entered the world, they could not leave this earth, and the result was still a scourge on society.</p>
<p>The so-called scourge is nothing more than seeking a narrow definition of justice for injustice. Bandits claim to kill corrupt officials, and chivalrous people open their mouths to fight injustice for others. Of course, they also have their own justice and injustice. Unfortunately, they "cannot accomplish their great cause," we only see them bullying the weak and oppressing the few, becoming a veteran dark force. However, whether it is "romance," "chivalry," or "mysticism," the quality of injustice gradually accumulates, all of which are premonitory signs, indicating the future complete destruction and construction of society!</p>
<h3>Rouge</h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>Miss Duan sat languidly in a soft chair, her eyes emitting an alluring light, her cheeks vividly bright.</p>
<p>"Miss Duan, you haven't been trying your best tonight," Zhi Mu approached Miss Duan and sat beside her.</p>
<p>"No. Mr. Su, I've certainly drunk more than you," she protested. "I already feel a bit dizzy. I don't want to dance; I want to go back to my apartment and rest early."</p>
<p>"That won't do. If you leave, who will enjoy dancing!" Zhi Mu said enthusiastically, "We can't do without you!"</p>
<p>"Really?" This flattery, coming from Mr. Su, whom she had just considered unfortunate, startled her slightly. "In that case, I really should go. Can't you dance with Miss Yu and Miss Wen?"</p>
<p>"If you really want to go back to your apartment to rest, please grant me the honor of escorting you back!" Zhi Mu gazed passionately at Miss Duan.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Miss Duan was clearly pleased. "That's very kind. We'll wait a while and then say goodbye to the hosts together," she replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>Zhi Mu and Miss Duan said goodbye to the hosts and other guests and came outside; it was almost eleven o'clock. Zhi Mu selected a car parked in front of the hotel, opened the door, and helped Miss Duan into the car. Zhi Mu instructed the chauffeur with a few words before getting into the car himself, and the car sped off like lightning.</p>
<p>The two began to chat: from the hostess's new evening gown to the students studying in Paris, and then to the international student dormitories in New York; then back to the French Autumn Salon and their respective departures from Nanjing, Beiping, and Shanghai. Zhi Mu spoke eloquently, and Miss Duan's conversational prowess was overshadowed.</p>
<p>"You were as quiet as a mute at the party, but now you can't stop talking!" She greatly regretted her hasty conclusion about Mr. Su, and said this with a mixture of apology and admiration.</p>
<p>"Now I am alone with a beautiful lady, while earlier I was attending a motley gathering!" Zhi Mu said thoughtfully and solemnly.</p>
<p>Miss Duan gradually grew fond of this Mr. Su, who was knowledgeable and well-traveled, and she was happy to continue the conversation. However, she felt even dizzier, and a sense of nausea arose in her heart. The food and drink seemed to surge up from her throat. She moaned softly, leaned against the corner of the car, pressed her chest, and remained silent for a moment.</p>
<p>"Are you alright?" Zhi Mu asked with concern.</p>
<p>"This car is making me even dizzier. Why haven't we arrived at my apartment yet?" she said intermittently.</p>
<p>"I think we'll be there soon. Perhaps they're repairing the street somewhere, and the car has to take another route," Zhi Mu said, knowing full well that the car had already passed through the center of Paris and was heading towards the Bois de Boulogne.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I'm going to throw up; what should I do in this car?" she said anxiously.</p>
<p>"Try to hold it in," Zhi Mu, seeing the rows of trees outside the car window receding, knew that the car had entered the Bois de Boulogne and was circling around.</p>
<p>Both fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>"I really can't stand it anymore! And I feel a bit cold," she moaned and complained again.</p>
<p>"Let me see what street we're on," Zhi Mu reached out and first tightened the belt of her autumn coat, then lifted the car curtain and looked out. "Oh dear, he's taken us to the Bois de Boulogne. How awful! He thinks we're one of those young couples out for a night stroll!"</p>
<p>"The Bois de Boulogne! That will be the death of me!" Miss Duan cried out in despair. Feeling anxious, she almost vomited, and quickly stretched her neck, leaning back on the soft cushion of the car seat.</p>
<p>"It's my fault for not making the street name clear! Since we're here, let's find the nearest hotel where you can rest a bit, or even throw up, and then take another car back to your apartment, okay?"</p>
<p>Miss Duan didn't dare to answer, afraid that the food and drink in her stomach would come up. Zhi Mu pushed open the front glass window and instructed the chauffeur to drive the car to the nearest Grande Cascade hotel.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Grande Cascade hotel, Zhi Mu got out of the car first to reserve a room, then paid the fare and helped Miss Duan out of the car. The electric lights in front of the hotel illuminated her pale face, and her eyes had lost their usual brilliance, her eyebrows tightly furrowed. She lowered her head, not wanting the waiter to see her face. Mechanically leaning on Zhi Mu's arm, she walked into the hotel. The two took the elevator together to room 39 on the third floor.</p>
<p>Entering the room, Zhi Mu gently laid Miss Duan down on the chaise lounge. She lay unconscious, emitting rapid, low moans and heavy breathing.</p>
<p>Zhi Mu pressed the electric bell, and a maid knocked on the door and entered.</p>
<p>"Sir, I await your instructions," the maid said respectfully.</p>
<p>"The lady is drunk. Please prepare a basin, as she may throw up soon. After she vomits, wash her face, take off her clothes, and tuck her into bed. I'll go downstairs for a cup of coffee and then return."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>Zhi Mu took the elevator back downstairs.</p>
<p>The next morning, Miss Duan woke up first. She wanted to turn over and look at her newly successful oil painting by her bedside at her apartment. Lying in bed and admiring her masterpiece was her habit in recent weeks - but she was tightly embraced by two strong arms, and couldn't move at all. Only then did she realize that Zhi Mu was soundly sleeping beside her pillow! The events of last night's drunken affair suddenly flooded her memory. She was extremely ashamed, and she didn't bother to resent Zhi Mu, who had toyed with her and was now sleeping soundly. Nor was she in a hurry to break free from his warm embrace; she only buried her face in Zhi Mu's shoulder and sobbed softly.</p>
<h3>On the Pinghan Railway Line</h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>Although the Pinghan train runs on the great plains, its speed is pitifully slow.</p>
<p>The train is loaded like cargo, with countless people, moving like an ox.</p>
<p>Listen! At the start of the northern section, the train is full of the accents of the Baoding area. People speak with the "er" sound, drawing it out long. In the central section, the simple and sincere voices of the Henan villagers are pleasant to the ear. Further south, each word has multiple syllables.</p>
<p>The train leaves Beiping and soon arrives at the Lugou Bridge. Further ahead, one can see the Yongding River, the great disaster of Hebei Province. During the spring flood season, the river is a vast expanse, the water reaching the embankment next to the railway bridge. In winter, the riverbed is exposed, with raised sand dunes, and water only between the dunes, frozen into silvery-white ice.</p>
<p>Soldiers, bandits, floods, droughts, and locusts travel throughout the land. Everywhere the train passes is desolate. The Pinghan train, with its peeling paint, travels through over a thousand miles of stripped land: everywhere is the same poverty, the same scars.</p>
<p>At each station, vendors wave their goods and shout. Braised chicken recooked multiple times, steamed meat buns with the skin peeling off, sesame cakes as hard as stones, and eggs as small as pigeon eggs are loudly hawked. Buyers must be careful not to receive counterfeit bills or eggs with a moldy taste.</p>
<p>Hunger and cold drive people to deceive!</p>
<p>At Changxindian, one can see the famous domestic repair yard, which reminds one of the Pinghan Railway's past, the demonstration by workers along the entire line against Wu Peifu. Changxindian is a poor place, and the large mound beside the platform has not a single blade of grass.</p>
<p>Arriving at Baoding, one can see the misery of this once-prosperous but now-decrepit city. Baoding station has over a dozen stalls selling braised chicken and pickled vegetables, well-known local products.</p>
<p>Along the way, one can see people pulling plows and elderly couples sighing as they push millstones. When the soldiers leave, the old cattle and donkeys leave their owners.</p>
<p>Dingxian is a famous place; it is on the Pinghan line. At the station, one cannot see the achievements of the Ping Christian Church, but there are vendors loudly selling eyewash.</p>
<p>Many people in Dingzhou suffer from eye diseases, their eyelids red. The Ping Christian Church's sanitation work should show results in this area.</p>
<p>The train moves like an ox. The windows in third class are incomplete, and cold wind blows in at night. First class on the Pinghan train is like second class, second class is like third class, and third class is worse than fourth class on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Passengers think of the Pinghan Railway's own debts, and cannot demand new cars. However, locomotives with "Beining" markings are already running on the Pinghan line.</p>
<p>Crossing the Yellow River, look at the earthen walls of Zhengzhou. Uncomfortable sleep, perhaps in a sense of poverty, passes the forty-four hours and twenty minutes of the long journey.</p>
<h3>Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>Night, silent night, boundless dark night!</p>
<p>I've started to suffer from insomnia, but it makes me happy. Indeed, insomnia has become something that pleases me. Perhaps some people don't believe me, but I am being completely honest.</p>
<p>Friends whom I forget during the day because of life and work, I remember them all when I suffer from insomnia. When each person's image appears in my mind, I think about many things, such as their lives, their thoughts and actions, their unfortunate experiences, their poverty and future prospects, even problems that they may not have time to think about.</p>
<p>For four or five years, I have often been mocked by my friends, who say I am unfeeling and don't care about them. But heaven knows how much I think of them in sleepless nights, how much I worry about their difficult lives, how much I resent their unfortunate experiences. Therefore, I often thank insomnia, which reminds me of my friends, my beloved parents and siblings, in the silent late night.</p>
<p>But insomnia sometimes does give me pain. For example, during the day I completely forget everything about myself because of busy work: I forget the past misfortunes, I forget the greatest trauma. But when I suffer from insomnia, all the painful memories, the deep scars, flood my mind. They are so terrible, like a knife cutting my liver and intestines, countless arrows shooting my heart, a fierce tiger tearing open my head and chewing my bones, sucking my blood. I feel uncomfortable, I feel great pain, but I can't move, like a paralyzed person who can't even turn over. My chest feels tight, and then I cry!</p>
<p>Every time I have insomnia, I watch the sky grow light.</p>
<p>In all honesty, insomnia has given me many benefits, such as reading, thinking, reviewing the past, and planning for the future. Everything that I don't have time to think about or do during the day can be done at night. I often think that life is too short, and decades pass like a flash. There is too much to do. If everyone could use their nighttime hours as productively as their daytime hours, society would progress faster, and humanity would not lag behind the times like a camel.</p>
<p>It's amazing, but I've been suffering from insomnia for eight years. In Beiping, there was a half-year period when I didn't sleep more than an hour a night. During that half-year, I finished several important books on social science. Although I was very tired during the day, the whip of life lashed heavily on my body, making me forget fatigue, forget pain, and just work for life, and live for work.</p>
<p>Later, life changed, and insomnia got a little better. I could sleep at least three hours a night. But for the past half-month, I have returned to the state I was in Beiping, watching the ceiling turn white.</p>
<p>But I don't curse insomnia; I should be grateful for the benefits it has given me!</p>
<h3>The Shanzhuang Ticket (7)</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>Where to go? Of course he was a rich man, but before tomorrow, he still had to lie on Oyster Shell Street for one more night, although he thought it would be his last.</p>
<p>Tonight was the first night he couldn't sleep because of happiness and joy, which he could only vaguely recall from the night before his wedding at eighteen. But how different it was! From now on, he was a rich man!</p>
<p>Hearing other coolies snoring beside him, he couldn't help but want to laugh out loud. Who would have thought that he had already become a rich man? Ah, farewell, cement sidewalks! Ah, ah, farewell, centipede-legged arcades! Tomorrow night he would sleep on a warm, soft steel-wire bed, he would eat oily food, wear silk, ride in cars.</p>
<p>He was waiting for the rooster to crow, he was waiting for the factory whistle to blow, he was waiting for dawn.</p>
<p>The sky wasn't fully bright yet, but A-Fa had already paced back and forth in front of the entrance to the Xinglong Shanzhuang ticket shop dozens of times.</p>
<p>Five o'clock, six o'clock, the street cleaners had already swept the bottom of the arcades with large bamboo brooms, and villagers carrying vegetables were creaking into the city.</p>
<p>Seven o'clock, eight o'clock, many small shops opened their doors.</p>
<p>Nine o'clock, the big companies opened their doors. More people appeared, and more vehicles.</p>
<p>A-Fa was like a pendulum, pacing back and forth twenty times every hour in front of the door. He had counted the doors of Xinglong hundreds of times. From left to right, there were twenty-five wooden doors. From right to left, there were still twenty-five. Each door panel seemed to be sullenly and elongated facing him.</p>
<p>A kind of ominous premonition was warning him in his chest. But he dared not think, he dared not believe. It would be too terrible.</p>
<p>No, the two extinguished lanterns at the entrance still stood there like door gods. They were trustworthy, which comforted him.</p>
<p>Ten o'clock, tea houses and restaurants were all packed with people, packed with sounds.</p>
<p>Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, many students and workers went home for lunch, and the poisonous sun shone directly on the blue pavement, which softened and begged for mercy. But the doors of Xinglong remained closed, and would never open.</p>
<p>Soon many shop assistants ran over and pasted many "flyers" on these twenty-five elongated faces.</p>
<p>He hoped that he was dreaming, that he had a fever. But many voices confirmed that the Xinglong shop owner's escape was real.</p>
<p>He wanted to cry, to curse, to hit people, but he had no strength left in his body. Not a single bit of energy. He just pulled the corners of his mouth down.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered: he hadn't eaten anything for a day and a night.</p>
<p>Then a wave of unbearable hunger prevented him from straightening his back. (End)</p>

<h3>Margin Money</h3>
<p>— Hua Gong</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of modern exchange society is probably the so-called buying and selling of gold. Besides its role in displaying luxurious ornaments, gold not only serves as a measure of commodity value, a material for coinage, and a means of payment and storage, but also forms a commodity itself, to be bought and sold, expressing its value in another form of currency. The gold market is the exchange. The buying and selling of gold is probably the simplest form of exchange, because there are only two ways: selling and buying, and all transactions must be settled clearly within a certain period. At the same time, in a modern world where everything is exchanged as a commodity, it aims at profit and completely deviates from the premise of exchange that "anything exchanged as a commodity must have its own use value." Therefore, the buying and selling of gold, which offers little help to life, is also the most typical form of exchange.</p>
<p>At first glance, the most direct and profitable buying and selling of gold is carried out by those like wealthy residents of the foreign concessions, frustrated politicians, managers, compradores, bankers, and factory owners. Ordinary, unrestrained young people, enticed by its "most direct and profitable" nature, also flock to it, calling it "speculation."</p>
<p>In reality, things are not so simple. The fluctuation of gold prices changes with certain global economic conditions and the exchange rates of various countries. As the saying goes, "A single hair can move the whole body." It is even more controlled by large players—mostly banks and money shops, whose transactions often involve thousands of taels, a far cry from the seven or fourteen taels of retail accounts.</p>
<p>Recently, the United States wanted to implement its silver policy, raise silver prices, and actively buy silver. Gold prices fell, benefiting "short sellers"—those who sold a certain amount of taels at a good price earlier, waiting to buy them back at a lower price. Conversely, those who believe prices will rise are called "long sellers." These are all gold industry terms. However, recently the United States suddenly abandoned this policy and sold silver. In a day or two, gold soared by dozens of yuan. The profits earned by short sellers were not enough to cover all the losses. The suicide reported in the May 3rd edition of this newspaper was undoubtedly directly affected, although it involved speculation in day-trade currency exchange.</p>
<p>"Su XX usually...frequented various markets and engaged in gold trading. Unfortunately, his luck was not good, and he suffered repeated losses, amounting to more than 80,000 yuan. As a result, his capital flow was disrupted, and he was unable to make up for the losses. Although he tried every means to raise money, it was all in vain. Desperate, he...suddenly swallowed opium the other day (the 1st)..."</p>
<p>The changes in U.S. monetary policy affected speculators and were not limited to Su XX's suicide. The things that the newspapers cannot and do not announce are much more than those that have already been announced. This is our experience in reading newspapers.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is the undertow of the big players' loosening or tightening of control, and the waves overwhelm the scattered small players. The profit from the buying and selling of gold is only the "spread"—the difference between the buying and selling prices. If there are no waves, how can one make money?</p>
<p>Therefore, when a change comes, the big players can easily sense it and adapt to it. With one move, they can always make money. But the small players who float along, not knowing whether they will live or die, suffer. Many are ruined.</p>
<p>According to those experienced in this field, the buying and selling of gold requires stability, agility, the ability to read the market, and decisiveness. "Scalping"—a gold industry term for quickly buying when you see an opportunity and selling as soon as you make a profit—is less likely to lead to losses.</p>
<p>In short, it is a business for the rich. The rich can make money with one move, while the small-time brokers who "make a living" in the hands of the rich suffer deeply.</p>
<p>The world is just this world!</p>
<h3>May Feelings</h3>
<p>— Bo Er</p>
<p>Lightning-like time can be seen eroding day by day on the pages of the calendar. May, it's May again. It is our tragic, painful, indignant, roaring, fiery May. From May 1st, May 3rd, May 4th, May 5th, May 7th, May 9th to the May 30th Movement that stirred the entire sleeping Chinese state. Each event has its profound meaning and contains endless great power.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? Scene after scene unfolds before our eyes: The flames of the May 1st labor class struggle threaten the capitalist fortress and are the prelude to the victory of the proletariat. May 3rd is the vanguard of the Japanese imperialist iron hooves trampling our territory—Shandong. May 4th, centered on the intellectual class, unveils the campaign to overthrow traitors and accept the baptism of new culture, shaking the cornerstone of China's old culture that has lasted for thousands of years. May 5th is when Sun Yat-sen took office as the Extraordinary Provisional President, opposing the warlord Yuan Shikai; on the one hand, it is the rise of Chinese democratic politics, and on the other hand, it is the birth of Karl Marx, the founder of scientific socialism. May 7th and May 9th are warlords implementing treasonous acts, and Japanese imperialists implementing grand attempts to seize China. This crisis has agitated the half-dead and half-alive old China. It is the beginning of the Great Revolution and the prelude to the anti-imperialist struggle. The outbreak of the May 30th Incident more clearly exposes the true face of imperialism and is their attempt to directly suppress the Chinese national revolution.</p>
<p>From these days, China has experienced unprecedented great changes. However,</p>
<p>These events seem to be quietly slipping away before our eyes today. People seem to have forgotten. In the past, there were passionate commemorations, support associations, propaganda teams, and revenge-and-save-the-nation groups, and even suicide squads were organized. Now, it is enough to lower the flag to half-mast and suspend entertainment as a memorial. Thus, the Chinese will be ridiculed by foreigners as having "five-minute enthusiasm," "China is forgetful," and "Chinese are only fit to be slaves." Do we really not know how to commemorate? No—we don't need to make formal, foolish movements, enduring hardship and biding our time to save the country. However, as a result, the four northeastern provinces are no longer our territory! The Manchurian dragon flag and the bright red Japanese flag freely fly in the sky, intersecting with each other. What is going on? Rows of jade-green armored vehicles fly out of XX Road and XX Road. Pedestrians stop in surprise, mistakenly thinking that a great war is about to break out. Everyone barely suppressed a burst of cold sweat, taking a breath. It wasn't the start of the war. The armored vehicles drove past, and only then did people feel relieved and restart their numb legs.</p>
<p>Poor old people of China! We stand on Chinese soil, but we dare not speak Chinese, but have to lose color in fear on the road. Why do we have to show such weakness? The country is about to fall, it's hard to be a slave, and embracing a heart full of sorrow and indignation, let us cry out loud:</p>
<p>"Roar, China!"</p>
<h3>On Disputes</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>After reading classmate Bai's article published in the paper on the 5th, I deeply sympathize, but I have some other opinions.</p>
<p>He said that the "Cleanliness Competition in Dormitories" organized by the New Life Movement Promotion Association in the school was met with dissatisfaction by some students, and the main reason was fundamental dissatisfaction with the organization of the student union. Disputes between the so-called elegant self-admirers and the "petty politicians" in the student union are constantly brewing and erupting.</p>
<p>This is indeed a common dark side of the student world, and in a broad sense, it is the inevitable state of politics in every country. Elegant self-admirers, hermits from the forests, are unwilling to compromise, nor are they willing to remain silent. They inevitably often grumble and indirectly criticize, but the result is nothing more than inciting trouble, and the exposure of such disputes often has no good result.</p>
<p>As Mr. Bai said, I know those celebrities in our school well. They usually wipe their noses with their sleeves and use towels as foot cloths, and are used to being unruly and uninhibited. Moreover, they were unwilling to attend the founding meeting of the student union. After the election, they were not on the list, but they were unwilling to give up, so they naturally took revenge on the New Life Movement Promotion Association organized by the student union. The students who practice the New Life Movement are called "running dogs," which shows that they are noble and unwilling to cooperate with "running dogs."</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of dispute is what causes social unrest.</p>
