<h3 id="c19">德奥邊境武裝衝突說　愼 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>德奥邊境發生武裝衝突之說。經奥國薩爾士堡省當局負責否認。而德國境内遍佈戰爭空氣。一方面極力崇奉戰前德意志之武功。他方面復以鋼盔眩耀現時希特勒之偉績。立於另一極端之蘇聯。對之固表示厭惡。卽與德有同情之意國。亦將轉與法英漸趨一致。共同支持奥大利之獨立。甚至非公式表示。屆萬不獲已時。不惜用武力以援助奥國。則是歐洲風雲之緊急。又在戰爭前夕之狀態中矣。</p>
<p>德國人民受凡爾賽和約之束縛。迄今十五年有餘。雖賠欵已減輕。該約已爲部分的修正。然軍備之不平等。薩爾鑛區之被支配。四週各小國之重重監視。使久受愛國訓練之德人。目擊心傷。傅思振奮其武力。以圖打破現狀。换言之。卽欲廢除凡爾賽和約。取得軍備上自由平等之心。未嘗或忘。但以法蓔西爲之阻碍。又有小恊國爲法衛星。於此而欲以合法手段。在國際聯盟會議塲上求得圓滿解答。自知勢不可能。無巳。惟有訴諸國民。自動的向增加軍備之途猛進耳。然德國西境。旣感法比之制限。東境彼蘭。亦相當强大。卽捷克斯拉夫。亦未可輕敵。惟奥大利與德國種族相同。在經濟上地理上皆有與德合併之可能。是以國社黨乃謀揷足於奥。希冀奥國在希特勒支配之下。以結成申歐之經濟聯盟。以共同抵制凡爾賽體系各國。</p>
<p>此舉果成事實。法蘭西洵感受莫大之威脅。意大利尤不免受直接之惡影響焉。蓋意欲與法國在地中海兩岸與中歐爭一日之短長。故曾不惜援助德國。以打破凡爾賽體系之桎梏。其與法國對立之意義。殆與德國相反。意大利欲執中歐之牛耳。領袖中歐之經濟聯盟。因而反對法國之包辦歐洲政策。則又豈願德國之特别强盛乎。是以於德國伸手於奥國之後。意卽聯結英法。共同宣言保持奥大利獨立。法且積極聯合小恊約國。使歐洲大陸諸國。皆在法國領導之下。以支持其所謂安全保障。卽與法國素立於相反地位之蘇聯。亦成立友好關係。换言之卽表示對德關係之傾向於惡化也。英國對歐洲情勢。原甚持重。無論助德助法。要皆保守其外交上傳統之精神。今於德國對奥大利猛進之舉。雖仍表現其維持現狀之意。續倡其軍備縮減之舊調。但於實際亦欲援助法意以限制德國。</p>
<p>就奥國最近形勢而論。人口旣集中於都市。出産尤不足以自給。欲勉强圖存。僅有親德一途。可以打開當前之難關。尅制以借債爲生活之苦境。卽以民族之語言習慣。及歷史傳統論。皆具與德合併之可能性。不過希特勒黨徒一味躁進。亦巳挑動奥人之惡感矣。故論目前情勢。德已陷於外交孤立之境。</p>
<p>然則德意志處此境地。眞將奮起其國民熱血。以武力爲最後解决之工具乎。假令希特勒果如此者。恐亦未必爲德國前途之福也。夫近代戰爭。决非恃一時血氣之勇可以將事。暫時之勝利。亦不足爲憑。必以豐富之資源。熟練之科學技術。深厚有力之經濟組織。夫然後乃能制勝於疆場也。今日之德意志科學技術。誠可謂爲相當精密矣。國民反抗之熱情。亦達於極點矣。其如天賦資源貧乏何。經濟結構脆弱何。假使不幸而發生戰爭。封鎖之厄。勢必難免。久經奮鬭之德人。當亦自知處境之危險。而不敢盲奮進。據此以推論中歐風雲。雖極暗淡。恐未必卽立時爆發流血之慘劇也。</p>

<p>（東京）　本日之貴族院預算總會巳於午前十時十七分開會、首由大藏公望男爵關於滿洲問題提出質問、</p>
<p>（一）政府部内處理滿洲問題誰主其事、</p>
<p>（二）檢討對滿政策、有無建新國策必要</p>
<p>（三）日滿間應否訂立明顯之條約、</p>
<p>（四）日滿間倘有决定之事項、應在條約範圍内開始行動、</p>
<p>（五）將來應充分援助「滿洲國」、</p>
<p>以上五項應請明白答辯、昨日首相對於岩倉男爵之質疑、謂與其新設機關於滿洲、不如完成舊有之組織、但今日吾人對於滿洲問題、實不知應至何處談論、關於經濟産業問題是否應申各務大臣首當其衝、余以爲應派遺第一流人物赴滿、使之開發産業經濟、首相以爲何如　余更覺關於滿洲問題、有組織官民共同委員會之必要、</p>
<p>齋藤首相答、</p>
<p>「滿洲國」近已成爲「帝國」、故其條規與其他等節當有維新之舉、特務部乃過渡之組織、其於維持治安及其他各種情况、此後當有漸次轉换之情形也、</p>

<p>首相之答辯余不能滿足、</p>
<p>關於對滿政策、該男爵則要求臨時開設秘密會、乃於十時五十六分起至十一時五十分爲此項秘密會之時間、其後復由</p>

<p>對滿宜竭全力以援助之、但不知對於日滿之關係有無導入眞正親善之方策、有無對滿移民之思想、關於開發産業擁有若何計劃、</p>
<p>齋藤首相答、</p>
<p>吾人對於世界各國均抱有導入親善之方策、至於對滿是不待論、移民滿洲將來擬相當設法、關於開發産業、現正在考慮之中、</p>

<p>羅馬　聞艾登與墨索里尼業巳同意之點、大致如下、</p>

<p>政友會之危機</p>
<p>現内閣之苦境</p>
<p>日本政局的動摇、誰都知道是有時代背景的、這種時代背景、在日本特别嚴重、卽是一般社會所宣傳的國際危機、丨一九三六年的危機、丨日美開戰的傳說、日蘇必戰的傳說、最近還加上日英關係的惡化、日本參謀部固然特别的忙碌、陸軍海軍、亦都在凖備、急急擴張軍備、擴張軍備越緊急、一般社會不安的空氣、就越濃厚、</p>
<p>原來齋藤内閣、是所謂非常時期的舉國一致内閣、祇要渡過了非常時期、就應該恢復常態、實際上所謂非常時期、就日本實情而論、還是對内的成分多、象這樣齋藤内閣、早就應該爲本身不健全而去職了、乃不料竟延長到現在、换了海軍大臣·外務大臣·陸軍大臣·商工大臣、現在又牽涉到政友會出身的文部大臣了、以前的岡田·内田·荒木·都是以病體不勝煩劇爲理由而辭職、只有中島久萬吉、纔爲貴族院追問「足利尊氐論」有傷日本國體關係、而被迫辭職、其實過去幾位大臣辭職、都包藏着日本内政外交上嚴重矛盾、所謂「病」、的確是假借的話、由這種閣員補缺的辦法、就可以知道非常時内閣的特性、也可以窺見日本政治最近變化的一部面、</p>
<p>齋藤内閣此後、是不是會倒塌、要看倒閣運動的實力何如、同時又要看他們所運用的政治手腕怎樣、照過去的情形、何嘗不是對齋藤内閣表示不滿、何嘗不以齋藤内閣爲太軟弱無力、然而竟不能推倒牠、軍部所期望的强力内閣難産、政黨内閣竟醖釀不成、其原因是軍部方面内部並不十分統一、海軍和陸軍政治見解不同、而陸軍方面、荒木·眞崎·宇垣·三派鼎立、互不相下、所以平沼内閣已成過去、恐怕今後再不會實現了、其次是元老派代表、如西園寺公望氏諸人、頗不直軍部之所爲、更不肯輕於任軍部組閣、而政黨内閣、又因爲政黨信譽失墜、一刻不易恢復、這次鳩山文相受賄案、岡本氏盡情暴露、雖事實還不必一定正確、却是對政黨的損害很大、要想就此回復立憲常軌、幾不可能、</p>
<p>况且現在的政友會内部情勢、和清浦内閣時代相似、床次·久原·與幹部派感情的對立、十分尖銳化、因爲津雲國利與西方利馬兩氏的違反黨紀、除名問題、引起政友會的内部糾紛、床次竹二郎的反對論、望月圭介的愼重說、使現幹部陷於進退維谷之境、黨内的統制、旣發生問題、於是牽涉到整個的議會政治、</p>
<p>鳩山一郎·和三士忠造·都是政友會出身的現内閣閣員、他們都是牽入紀綱問題的要角、眞相何如、是另一問題、卽此就可以衝動一般社會的感情、可以暴露現政府的汚點和弱點、加以軍部從中利用、想乘勢造成軍人法西斯政治、而久原一派、旣與政友會幹部派不睦、祇要能推倒現内閣、就不擇手段、與國民同盟暗中勾結、聯合不平分子、集全力以攻擊現政府的弱點、同時更圖與床次一派相聯絡、以反對幹部派、他們的步驟、第一退回除名處分書、第二彈劾幹部開除代議士黨籍之不當、第三提出不信任總裁案、當然在這時期各地方與議院内、會有擁護現幹部的運動、兩相對立之下、政黨的醜相、自然暴露得更厲害、軍人愈要利用這種糾紛來進行倒閣、不過將來的問題、軍部包辦政治的實際性、還是不成熟、議會的形式、依然可以延長若干時期、（二月二十三日於東京）</p>

<p>此後的一個多月、我們除應該省當局的幾次宴會外、全部時間、就埋頭於廣西現有經濟資料的研究中、把所有廣西各機關出版的各種刊物、報章雜誌、以及統計局正在編印中的廣西年鑑材料、詳細檢閱了一遍、這段期間、我們稱之爲調查預備期間、在没有詳細叙述我們的調查印象以前、我將借此機會、先說一說廣西的民團和公路、</p>
<p>民團是廣西當局舉全力以赴之的大政之一、該省當局有兩句口號、是「寓兵於團、寓將於學」、姑無論這種政策對不對、但我們以爲他們這種魄力和精神、是值得國人深切地注意的、怎麽呌做「寓兵於團」呢、這就是民團軍隊化、軍隊民團化、現在廣西全省的民團、皆隸屬於省政府主席指揮、他們把全省民團按照舊道屬劃分爲六區、（以前原分十二區）每區設正副指揮官各一人、區之下爲縣、縣設正司令副司令各一人、正司令由縣長兼任、副司令由省府委派、縣之下分設常備隊·預備隊·後備隊、常備隊半年退伍一次、一年退伍兩次、退伍後就爲預備隊、全省共二百五十一隊的常備隊、每隊九十人、一年至少當有四萬受過軍事訓練的壯丁、後備隊無論農工商學、二十歳以上四十歳以下、不分職業、（除公務人員及敎職員外）一起編入後備隊、服團丁任務、預備隊後備隊、每年於秋冬農隙之時、作大規模的秋季大演習、此外擇期更調訓練、照這樣做去、統計一年中、後備隊可訓練二十八萬人、常備隊四萬人、共三十二萬人、三年内可訓練壯丁一百萬人、假定廣西總人口爲一千二百萬、其中六百萬爲女子、三百萬爲老幼殘廢、尚有三百萬壯丁、照此計劃次第施行、十年之内、廣西壯丁皆成精兵、但現在軍隊有了、官長那兒來呢、因此他們又提出了「寓將於學」的計劃、卽民團官長之養成、由本省高中以上的學校、實行軍事訓練、畢業的學生、便可以當民團的隊長或排長、廣西共有四個高中、一個大學、所有畢業生、調充民團官長、是足够分配的、這種辦法、據他們說、在民團方面固然很好、在學生本身方面、也不至出來没有職業、流爲高等游民、可以辦理民團和地方自治事業、這是民團中下級幹部之養成、這是指平時而言、至在戰時、卽總動員的時候、需要大多數的幹部、也可由民團幹部訓練所及高中以上的學校畢業生來調用、由此看來、三年以後、全省有一百萬受過軍事訓練的壯丁、中下級幹部又有着落、這就很可以注意的了、至於民團的餉項、從前是除總指揮部及區指揮部經費由省庫支給外、其餘縣民團司令部的經費及常備隊餉項、均由各縣就地自籌的、以後因爲這種辦法、不獨跡近苛細、且經乎中飽、流弊叢生、故自二十一年度起、所有省區縣各級民團機關及特務隊·常備·預備·各隊經費、概由省庫統籌支給、民團的槍械、亦由公家負責購買、</p>
<p>關於學校的軍事訓練、廣西省政府於二十一年五月曾通過了一個規程、凡高中學生在修業時間、都要受一千二百小時的軍訓、前四個學期、側重術科訓練、後兩個學期、專受學科敎程、每年度的暑假、還要實施極嚴格之野外演習二星期、前期軍事學術科、每學期定爲三學分、後期每學期、定爲一學分、軍紀則按操行分數計算、凡軍訓學分未滿或軍紀不及格者、均不得畢業或升學、廣西各中學及廣西大學的軍事訓練、是極嚴格的、學生除受軍訓外、同時在校内還要執行軍隊的紀律、白健生氏對南寗的學生演說、「高中的學生、不惟在軍事上的學術科、要加以積極的訓練、卽學生的一切行動、皆當以軍隊管理的方法管理他們、務使學生的生活軍隊化、紀律化、」但因爲過於着重軍事管理的結果、有時也不免發生流弊、廣西大學有一位同事告訴過我、去年該校有一位軍事敎官、把兩個學生捉去坐監、曾閙起了一塲風潮、南寗民國日報上曾載着某校有一學生、因未到用膳時間跑去吃飯、學校牌示開除、文告的結末兩語是、「着卽開除學籍以肅軍紀而維校風」、把「軍紀」放在「校風」之前、可知他們辦學精神之所在、自實行軍訓後、最初頗激起了各校學生的反對、嗣當局表示「廣西爲國防而練民團、爲養成對外戰爭時之軍官而辦軍事訓練、如一人反對、一人開除、全校反對、則全校解散」、嗣卽開除廣西大學學生代表二十餘名、這風潮才告平息、不過據各校當局說、學生之因軍訓而自動退學者、亦不在少數、且有超過四分之一者、聽說現在卽自動退學、亦所禁止、（某當局表示卽自動退學、仍須追究家屬）、退學人數、當可减少了、此種軍國民敎育之爲利爲弊、我們因對政治爲門外漢、不願加以申論、</p>
<p>其次我們再論公路、公路乃廣西建設成績中之最昭著者、因爲廣西直到最近爲止、還没有興築鐵路、交通全恃河道、廣西之主要河流凡三、曰邕河·灘河·柳河、梧州位居西江下游、舉凡邕柳灘三江、往來客貨、卽全桂及滇黔一部分之客貨、均經梧州出入、故梧州實握全省交通總樞紐、其餘桂·柳·邕·龍·色諸埠、雖均有水道可以利用、然每值春冬之交、灘多水涸、交通卽極困難、航行船隻、有時須下水扛抬、始能逾越、然行旅亦動須經旬、自近年積極修築公路後、截至最近爲止、計已成立公路、凡七二九四里、所成立的幹綫、計如下列、</p>
<p>邕柳路　　邕寗至柳州　　六七五里</p>
<p>柳桂路　　柳州至桂林　　五四○里</p>
<p>桂全黄路　桂林至黄沙河　三二○里</p>
<p>桂永路　　桂林至永福　　一一○里</p>
<p>荔賀路　　荔浦至賀縣　　四二五里</p>
<p>大池路　　大塘至河池　　四三○里</p>
<p>柳武路　　柳州至武宣　　二四○里</p>
<p>柳長路　　柳州至長安　　三○○里</p>
<p>賓貴路　　賓陽至貴縣　　二○○里</p>
<p>賓上路　　賓陽至上林　　一○○里</p>
<p>邕武路　　邕寗至武鳴　　一二○里</p>
<p>邕龍路　　邕寗至龍州　　六四○里</p>
<p>貴玉路　　貴縣至玉林　　二○五里</p>
<p>玉博路　　玉林至博白　　一四一里</p>
<p>玉陸路　　玉林至石角　　二二○里</p>
<p>容鬱路　　容縣至鬱林　　一九○里</p>
<p>容蒼路　　容縣至梧州　　二○○里</p>
<p>百平路　　百色至平馬　　一七○里</p>
<p>丹池路　　南丹至河池　　二八○里</p>
<p>邕蓲路　　邕寗至黄蓲　　二三五里</p>
<p>（其餘凡長不滿百里的支綫及縣道不錄）</p>
<p>幹綫與支綫合計逹七千二百餘里、這在行旅上誠然是莫大的方便、自公路成後、向之行程需時二十天的、今乃可於二三日内到達、卽以通航路的梧州與龍州來說、以前自梧州到南寗水道要三四天、南寗到龍州又要七八天、合計終要十數天以上、如今則自梧州到南寗一天、南寗到龍州也是一天、换言之、自省之極東到極西南、祗要兩天就夠了、</p>

<p>運費隨水脚增高</p>
<p>輪郵雙方巳議定</p>
<p>川河航輪同盟漲價、前訂水脚、一律廢棄、統用新運費單、而宜昌重慶間之郵包運載、比較各處爲多、近年客家將運川貨物、改郵包裝去者亦日漸增多、惟仍用輪船載去、關於郵包水脚、前定價目、亦不合用、輪公司亦隨之漲價、郵務管理局已與各輪局重訂運郵合同、而價亦變更、昨巳議妥、卽日簽字、兹錄如下、</p>

<p>此次川河輪水脚大漲、因各公司一致合作、故運費數額、有照原額加一倍以上者、川商雖一致反對、但亦無法抵制、除停運外、别無善策、而川河郵包特多、尤以貨物爲衆、郵務管理局爲此漲費問題、經與川河内航行之太古·怡和·捷江·招商·三北·民生·光耀·及懸法旗之福源等輪公司議定、川河郵件包裹之水脚合同、磋論多日、至昨日巳將擬定合同、由郵局分送各輪公司、簽字實行、</p>

<p>美國實施提高金價後、近日復提議提高銀價政策、引起全世界之注意、我國爲用銀國、自有多方面之影響、而應及時凖備應付之策、惟銀價之變遷、與我國經濟上之關係、至爲複雜、斷非單純之分析、可以明瞭厎藴、亦非假用一二外國名詞、卽可解釋清楚、且美總統羅氏、實施黄金白銀之政策、以應付世界經濟極端恐慌之環境、爲羅氏永垂不朽之政績、與世道人心、兩有裨益、而於福利民生、更有偉大之貢獻、我人誠宜潛心研究其政策之因果、與夫我國應付之對策、庶幾於經濟怒潮澎湃之中、我國或可藉此而自救於不拔之境、爲說明提高銀價、與我國之利害關係、我人先須明了下列各點之關係、</p>
<p>（一）我國物價低落之原因　物價變遷之原因、極爲複雜、或爲貨幣數量漲縮有以致之者、有爲成本上之關係使之然者、以及供求一切之關係而發生者、衆說紛紜、是非難辦、惟貨幣數量漲縮一端、對於物價、雖不無關係、故有貨幣數量論之說、然則欲謂貨幣數量之膨脹緊縮、與物價之消長、有直接之比例關係、而遽以貨幣之多寡爲物價消長之唯一原因、實爲莫大之錯誤、蓋物價之變遷、因時代·環境·因素·而變遷、有時僅有一種變遷之原因、有時有數種變遷之原因、此點各國專家、皆有詳細之討論、毋須於此申說、考我國近年來各項物價、步步下落、其原因雖不止一端、而貨幣上之關係、極爲微細、固無足道者、就絲業而言、國外之市塲、早爲日本等國劫奪以去、國内之市塲、則受二層之打擊、第一、國人感受不景氣之壓迫、購買力極爲薄弱、第二、各國人造絲之侵入、極受國人之歡迎、推銷之廣、無達弗屆、以致我國固有之絲業、日趨衰落、絲價跌落矣、就茶業而言、國外之市塲、則早爲印度·錫蘭·等國奪去、我國之紅茶、已被擯棄、綠茶銷路較佳、惟因品質之低劣、以及滯銷之關係、我國之紅茶、於是慘跌、就棉業而論、近數年來、紗價連續跌落、其原因全係天災人禍、東北市塲被奪、而棉花之價、則微見上漲、其原因則以國内棉花、不敷應用、並非貨幣之多寡、有以致之、就米·麥·麵粉·雜糧·而言、則各價均一致下跌、其原因全係外國糧食、在我國市塲傾銷所致、綜上述各項物價以言、其變遷之原因、絕非貨幣所致、今再舉一例反證之、於近數年來、全國之現銀流入上海者、日漸增多、民國二十年一月爲銀元（折合）二七五、五七三、○○○元、民國廿二年十二月爲五○八、二三○、○○○元、增加幾一倍、何以除房租一項、有增加外、其他物價反致下跌、而房租之所以增高、亦有特殊之原因、姑暫勿論、於此可見貨幣之多寡、與物價在我國實無甚因果之關係也</p>
<p>（二）國際貿易搆成之原因　簡單言之、物價低落國之貨物、必可輸入物價較高之國以推銷、而輸入國之現金、必向外流出、物價於是跌落、在輸出國之情形、適得其反、蓋現金輸入、物價漸漲、昔時可以低廉之物品向外推銷者、今則反爲他國低廉之物品輸入矣、前爲出超、今爲入超、黄金復須向外流出矣、川流不息、循軌來去、但此項情形、在我國實無之、假定如時人所慮、銀價提高後、我國物價、卽須跌落、則外國高價之物品、無輸入低廉物價國之可能、而我國低廉之物品、反可輸入物價高昻之國矣、我國有何懼哉、再假定銀價提高、物價壓低、而我國低廉之物品、尚不能出口、豈銀價低落、物價抬高時反可增加高價物品之出口乎、前年金貴銀賤時、物價又低落、時人以爲出口必可大增特增、結果大失所望、關心時事者、尚可記憶也、要之我國之國際貿易、並不絕對以銀價之變遷爲依歸、而視華洋商之有利可圖與否爲根據、我國國内市塲、因内禍外患、巳成破碎支離之局面、我國工商業、全賴國際貿易之推動、以資興奮、此我人於討論銀價時、須三思而行者也、</p>
<p>（三）現銀外流之問題　如美國實行提高銀價、并在中國市塲吸收現銀、現銀於是必須外流、成爲問題、毫無疑義、但此項問題、不難應付、毋須驚惶失措、回憶去年五月間、紐約之銀價、較上海之銀價高至一百之十五成、當時現銀之流出共有若干、卽使外國貨物在我國市塲傾銷、現銀自須流出、而我國向爲入超國、現銀必須流出、（除非我國與各國停止一切貿易）但同時我人須注意者、外國政府旅客敎友等在華之費用、華僑之滙欵在華之一切投資欵項等、皆須用銀、是以外流之現銀、仍得流回也、且美國提高銀價、决不致率然提高、卽行吸收運送以去、至必須保存現銀時、當可設法應付、若於此時高唱禁止現銀出口、及徵收現銀出口税等、反使發生恐慌、摇動信用、影響公債市塲、是以一動不如一靜、暫可聽其自然也、</p>
<p>（四）金銀本位之問題　我國爲銀本位、美國爲金本位、立塲各有不同、美國爲産銀國、我國爲非産銀國、故於銀價提高時、産銀者當可獲得鉅利、而非産銀者、毫無利益、是以利害復相衝突、我人何苦提倡提高銀價、爲人謀利、言之不無理由、顧此點實不攻自破也、蓋我國不欲提高銀價、其反面卽欲提高金價、豈提高金價而不爲人謀利乎、豈我國由非産金國、而轉瞬變爲産金國乎、我國現旣非産金國、亦非産銀國、（將來或可採掘大量之金銀）是以金銀價格之漲落、均成問題、我國之唯一目的、在求金銀價格穩定之適當方法、使不受是項價格劇變之影響、不若英國之有金鑛、美國之有銀鑛、發生利害之衝突、前年金價飛漲時、我國幸而采用銀本位、未被捲入金本位崩潰之旋渦、現在銀價逐漸提高、我人儘可善用時機、運用此鉅量之銀值、對於進口貨物、政府不妨予以嚴厲之監督、禁止各項無謂消耗品之進口、以免無謂入超之增加、俟銀價提高至相當程度時、當可與金價成立一穩定適當之比例、各國遂可采用同一貨幣制度矣、嗣後各國間之貿易、絕不受金銀比價之影響、貨幣之烟幕彈旣去、將來國際貿易、全視各國之物價及生産之成本、爲競爭之工具、實際貨幣烟幕彈在中國之作用、極爲微細、已如上述、</p>
<p>（五）我國關税之影響問題　如果銀價提高、關税收入、以海關金折合銀元、必然减少、假定舊昔一海關金單位、可换二銀元、今銀價已高、祇可攙一銀元半、或一銀元、損失自屬不少、雖然此項折合之損失不可免、但我人亦可預料、進出口貿易之量值、俱可增加、而海關之總收入、必可增加、折合後之結果、亦可增加也、目前因銀價略有提高、絲市巳呈活動之氣象、交易逐漸開始、華北對美之出口貨物、於本年一月間、與去年同月之比較、增約一百之七十成、銀價提高之利害關係、於此亦可見其端倪、</p>
<p>總之、我人研究銀價之問題、須采用科學方法、立於第三者之地位、爲大衆謀福利、不佞敬以小百姓之地位、貢獻區區意見、幸希讀者指正、</p>

<p>纍纍鈔票悉變爲層層草紙</p>
<p>詐騙不足更僞造存單抵押</p>
<p>無錫人楊樂天、以星相卜筮爲業、前曾懸牌於西藏路東方飯店、每遇富商巨賈、往談休咎時、彼輒粲其生花之舌、信口雌簧、間以含有恫嚇性之危詞、使聞者心生疑懼、被卽乘機敲詐、受騙之人、實繁有徒、如某著名香烟公司總理亦曾被其愚弄、幾乎喪資萬金、幸覺悟尚早、未遭損失、然楊之欺騙手段、於此可見一斑、顧海上迷信之流、所在多有、楊無法施之於甲者、儘能施之於乙、近果有一蘇州、</p>
<h3 id="c155">富室之婦 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>被騙三千金之巨案發生焉、婦名徐如洵、嫁夫包某、未幾夫死、寡居於淡水路怡樂里十四號、現其年華雖已三十有八、而迷信心理甚濃、加以家境豐裕、燒香拜佛、算命看相、最爲所喜、其女友朱寳珍、曩曾就相於楊、經楊面諛之下、認爲其術神奇、乃慫恿徐氏、於去年八月二十七日、往東方飯店乞卜休咎、晤談後、楊察知徐氏心理、並見其、</p>
<h3 id="c156">服飾華美 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>料係富豪、隨卽施展故技、謂流年如何兇惡、命宫如何不利、苟不亟行禳解、微特災難將臨、抑且生命不測、一味妄言恐嚇、徐氏果入其彀、求其設法消祛、楊則索五十金、謂作解星之費、徐氏悉數給之、至九月二十日、楊又邀徐氏赴東方、謂汝之災晦、非五十金所能禳免、須再增一百二十八元、當爲汝去無錫設壇解救、該氏復如其言、以欵相交、詎隔一旬、楊以電話邀之續往東方、向之曰、前交之一百二十八元、就中有四十金、爲不潔之幣、褻凟神靈、非但不能消災、形將添難、</p>
<h3 id="c157">獲罪於天 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>不可禱也、言時、故作憂愁之狀、徐氏覩而大懼、哀求相救、楊始而表示無術挽回、繼乃言姑試爲之、着該氏籌三百金應用、徐氏遂於十月七日、携欵仍至東方、楊取其鈔票後命之面壁、刹那間、以紙包一、付該氏手執、一面用黄紙繪硃符焚化、並着該氏亦依樣畫符一紙、焚後囑持紙包歸家藏置、非經囑令開拆、不得私開、否則將有生命之虞、該氏敬謹受敎、携包歸去、其實此三百元之鈔幣、巳於其面壁時被楊、</p>
<h3 id="c158">盡入囊中 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>而以草紙置諸包内、該氏設竟不爲危言所嚇、歸而拆包、則黑幕當早敗露、不致續喪資斧、奈其迷信太深、視紙包幾似危險物、安置後不敢妄動、直至十二月六日、楊見被騙者毫無動靜、料無變故、遂又以電話召徐氏改往揚子飯店、並將談話中之恫嚇性質加重成分、以若得神佑、應再加增費用八百金、復設詞誘之、謂好在此欵仍係如前番之由汝保存、僅於禳解期内、不能取用、實際並無損失、該氏依然唯命是從、次日將欵往、楊亦、</p>

<p>祗以香烟匣代替紙包之不同而已、但兩人之交際、至此則巳日臻親密、楊旣詳悉徐氏之富庶、以爲欲騙其財、未可僅憑此術、於是僞造勞勃生路陸振大洋布號所出二千元之存單一紙、於本年一月六日、召徐氏往愛文義路愛仁里八號彼之家内、談論屢次解星困難、命該氏續增鈔票四百元時、卽以此存單向該氏抵押一千五百元、此際徐氏尚屬深信彌堅之候、故對此僞造單據、亦認爲眞者、毫不躊躇、隨卽給付、計自八月二十七日起以至彼時、陸續被楊所騙巳超出三千金之鉅、然該氏猶不稍悟、最近偶與其友顧范氏談及、范氏無彼之愚、</p>

<p>堅着徐氏將歷次携歸之紙包及香烟匣開視、該氏初尚猶豫、經范氏一再譬解、纔一一拆之、而内果皆爲草紙、徐氏深悔不迭、特於二月十九日奔至楊家交涉、楊恐一經宣揚、此技固難再展、而負罪尤深、爲緩和徐氏盛怒計、除自書悔過據外、並將寓中所有紅木器具及二九九八號汽車一輛、抵與該氏作價二千元、惟越日又被該氏查悉陸振大之存名、</p>
<h3 id="c161">亦屬假造 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>

<p>中央社云、自日漁輪萬一丸運輸第一批日魚進口以來、本埠各漁商卽均感極度不安、詎料事隔數日、竟又有日大黄魚三千擔、於本星期内進口、聞每擔價格祇十二元、大都運往首都、内祇一小部份、在本埠十六舖一帶銷售、兹將各方所得報告詳誌如下、</p>

<p>張夜城欲領回其女</p>
<p>竟控拘其離異之婦</p>
<p>丨公堂上流涙……旁聽者動容丨</p>
<p>南京人張夜城、向在政界辦事、并在南京開設旅館、於民國元年、張在滬結識本地女子趙芬芳（卽趙衡臻）、現年三十九歳、感情融洽、遂訂白首之盟、同居於首都、育有子女各一、子現年十九歳女名德政、又名連君、年祇十三、但至民國十一年間、張忽因某種關係、爲當局所逮、瑯璫入獄、而趙芬芳又因與張母意見相左、乃隻身來滬</p>
<h3 id="c183">賃屋獨居 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>迨張出獄、探悉趙在滬上、遂亦追踪來申、要求趙歸寗同居、趙未允、雙方遂於是年脱離關係、所生之子女、則由張撫養、但趙雖與張脱離關係、而其母子與母女關係、仍未斷絕、故雖迄今時隔十載、趙仍不時赴寗探望其子女、詎近來張夜城忽在江寗地方法院檢察處控訴趙芬芳拐騙其女張德政、遂由該院備文交張、着赴滬地探訪、</p>
<h3 id="c184">趙之踪跡 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>張乃於日前携文到申、投宿於廣西路太平洋旅館、一面查明趙住於白克路九星里十五號門牌、其女張德政、則巳化名趙連君、在愛文義路道中女子中學讀書、遂持文投報第一特區法院、請准拘票、發交該管新閘捕房、恊同華探目蘇應根·西探長麥克歪倫·於前日下午三時、分往以上兩處、將趙芬芳·趙德政·逮捕、帶入捕房、</p>

<p>暫留、昨晨轉送第一特院刑八庭、卽據捕房律師蔣葆廉陳明本案捕房係奉鈞院拘票前往拘捕、今兩造俱在庭上、請爲訊問、繼據張夜城投稱、年四十五歳、在政界服務、并在南京開設旅館、民國元年、余在滬上得識趙芬芳、同居於南京、育有子女各一、子現年十九歳、刻在南京、女卽德政、年十三歳、於民國十一年、余因國事</p>

<p>後、卽與趙脱離關係、惟爲人情計、趙每年輙至南京余家探望余之母親及其子女、去年十二月十七日上午、趙忽潛自來京、先在夫子廟某茶樓品茗、因其時余女德政、適在市立夫子廟小學校讀書、乃被趙私自將德政領去、乘車到滬、余當時并不知悉、直至次日、始悉女巳失踪、被趙所騙、乃投江寗地方法院檢察處、</p>

<p>在答覆你所詢問的幾個問題以前，我們覺得還應對於你的「生活問題」，略貢數言。</p>
<p>從來信中，我們知道你是一個頗富生活經騐的青年，並且在生存競爭中也是具有奮鬥精神的。目前擺在你的當前的是失業的威脅，使你覺得「前途未容樂觀」，道原是不足怪的。如果把今日這可怕的失業現象，從個人的前途作一種展望，誠不免要「悲從中來」，但是，倘若能看明了這是一個整個的社會問題，這一問題的解决要大衆共同努力，先消滅這産生失業的不良的根源，纔有可能時，你對於目前的飢餓，或者不獨不會作悲觀，消極的自餒，你反會生出奮鬥的勇氣來，對於前途抱着積極的樂觀的！所以，我們在敬佩你的奮鬥之餘，還不得不進一步的望你更進一步丨先消滅你的徘徊，躊躇畏縮中。等等灰色的思慮罷！</p>
<p>以下答覆你所詢問的幾個問題。</p>
<p>一·你問像你這樣生活境遇的人，「應不應」「能不能」研究國際問題？我們可以肯定的答道：你「應」該研究並且也「能」研究。這原因很簡單，就是今日世界已不是我們老祖宗的時代了。今日世界各國間巳被一種經濟的紐帶聯成了一個體系，地球上巳再没有一塊土地，能够不被今日的經濟關係所支配。因此，生在今日地球上每一角落裏的人民的生活也不得不受到世界各處的影響。譬如，美國需要日本的生絲，英國從世界各處輸進巨額的糧食，日本需要中國的煤鐵，俄美的石油，印度的棉花，中國與輸入美孚煤油、藍開夏的棉布，德國的顔料，肥田粉，各國的機器，日本的日用品，同時中國也輸出茶，絲，桐油，大豆，等。大家都巳在經濟上建立起了密切的關係；互相依存，成爲世界的經濟體。同時，因這種關係是取的資本主義的生産關係的形態，於是全世界所看見的祗是一塊塊的做生意的市塲，爲市塲而生産的千千萬萬工廠，許多市塲工廠聯結成一個個經濟領域，這經濟領域就是所謂國家，他們都在無政府的狀態中製造，販賣，爭奪市塲在行着經濟的政治的，甚或文化的」狹義言）「合縱」「連横」鬥爭。但是，如果世界中一個領域發生了毛病，就得影響全體，如一根練索一樣，一節脱了環，會要波及全體。生在今日的人類，無論你是英國人，日本人，中國人，全無例外，你都會受直接或間接國際影響，你再關不住大門，逃不開現實，你是被這經濟關係的網羅，束縛得緊緊的，絲毫不由你作羲皇上人的幻夢。</p>
<p>就中國人目前所處的境地說；你更不能不注意到國際間每天發生的一件事；譬如美國目前收買白銀，這一問題就不是美國一國的經濟政策，這是會使中國的大衆發生生死關係的。何以故？因爲美國提高銀價目的在奬勵對外傾銷，中國是用銀的國家，無疑的在外表上要發現中國購買力加强（不是眞的加强購買力是美貨取得中國國貨的地位了），美貨就會隨着這刺激像洪水般的汜濫中國市塲，中國唯一的農産市塲都會被美貨所代替，那時，不獨使白銀流出，造成通貨不足，惹起金融紊亂，而且，最最大的禍害還在它有加速農村經濟破産之作用。所以這一件事，雖然發生在美國，我們也不能不關心。</p>
<p>還有最近奥國的問題，巴黎以前的流血，蒙古的自治，新疆的獨立，西藏的進窺西康等等，現在都成了國際問題，因爲這些不獨對中國大衆有生死的關係而且要影響世界政府。這一切不僅政府當局應該注意，卽我們做小百姓的也應有澈底的認識，庶幾可以認識今日政府當局對這些問題所取的是如何的對策，是否是維護大衆的利益的，如其不然，我們應如何監督他，如何發揚我們民衆的要求，突破民族當前的危機，</p>
<p>所以，像你這樣生活的人自然應該研究國際問題，至於「能不能」那更是無問題的，因爲祗要你肯去研究，卽令是一個不識字的工人，也可以用談話去同人家討論，何况你巳有了文字的工具呢？</p>
<p>二，研究國際問題應該先從什麽地方着手？如何纔可養成正確的認識力？就你這樣的程度而言，我們覺得你應該先從研究的方法着手。本來國際問題就是社會科學的一個部門，研究的方法當然也就是研究社會科學的方法。</p>

<p>我國自清季興學、敎育史料、累積繁頥、近各省市間編年鑑、用資彙觀、然爲區域所囿、範圍有限、全國整個年鑑、尚付缺如、前部長朱公有見及此、因於去歳三月十六日、手諭前編審處、速編敎育年鑑、此第一次中國敎育年鑑之所由作也、</p>
<p>當以事體繁重、進行匪易、復於三月二十三日、派張司長修枬、郭司長心崧、顧司長樹森、李司長蒸、楊參事芳、陳參事石珍、協同編審處辛主任樹幟（編審處併人國立編譯館後改任館長）共同籌劃　、後辛主任等幾經會商、請於部次長、組織第一次中國敎育年鑑編審委員會、主持一切編審進行事宜、設置編纂、負撰輯稿件責任、於是於四月二十五日、派辛主任樹幟、張司長修枬、郭司長心崧、顧司長樹森、李司長蒸、楊參事芳、陳參事石珍、陳參事泮藻、伍參事俶周秘書淦、梁秘書濟康、張科長範九、謝科長樹英、郭科長有守、後改任專員）戴科長應觀、吳科長研因、鍾科長靈秀、彭科長百川、汪科長睿員等十九人爲編審委員、由辛主任負責召集、高等敎育司周君庶咸、王鳳桐、龔徵桃、柯樹屏、錢王君倬、高維昌、吳永龍、黄龍先、蔡毓　（已故）普通敎育司章慰高、王萬鍾、翁之達、陳哲、薛天漢、黄問歧、社會敎育司顧良杰、郭蓮峰、金桂蓀、舒楚石、高鴻圖、蒙藏敎育司賀伯烈、審事處薛銓曾、編審處李貽燕、胡顔立、周其動、黄守中、丁致聘、周邦道等二十八人爲編纂、並派定周君邦道爲主任編纂、嗣因部曹略有進退、公務又多冗忙、先後甲派高代司長廷梓、沈司長鵬飛、張司長炯、邱科長長康、程專員其保、楊專員廉、李專員熙謀、厲專員家祥等爲編審委員、左仲、趙潢、李公明、丁以忠、游春懋、　蕃、賣國恩、李光烈、李景耀等爲編纂、又於二十一年十月加派黄君問歧爲副主任編纂、另由編審委員會函聘邰爽秋、羅廷光、朱葆勤、金兆均、沈子善、鄭鶴聲、張秋西、楊克敬爲特約編纂、此第一次中國敎育年鑑工作同人分派與函聘之大概情形也、</p>
<p>編纂内容、初由周主任編纂邦道草擬目錄、後由編審委員會根據各司處意見、斟酌損益、最後决定、分爲五編甲編、敎育總述、乙編、敎育法規、丙編、敎育概况、丁編、敎育統計、戊編、敎育雜錄、各編更分若干章節、所以名爲第　次中國敎育年鑑者、因我國嚮無全國敎育年鑑之作、兹番編纂、誠爲創畢、目除法規、概况及統計事實取材較近外、其餘多起自清季、訖於現在、年限難以劃清、又我國幅員遼闊、交通不便、政令推行、時感窒滯、在最短期間内、年編一卷、以餉國人、亦似不易辦到、取回次體製、冠以此稱、幾費躊躇、惟核實言之、與其謂爲第一次中國敎育年鑑、不如調中國近代敎育史略第一集之較爲名實相符矣、</p>
<p>歐美各國出版敎育年鑑、其性質有　於國際的、國家的、敎育行政機關的與學術研究的　等之不同、其體例則有報告概况、討論問題、登載專著、陳述研究結果、及錄列敎育法規之差異、本年鑑之性質爲屬於國家敎育行政機關的、其體例屆重概况之報告、佐以法規之錄列、附以研究結果之陳述、至敎育事實之縱的叙述、如甲編中之敎育宗旨、學校系統、敎育行政組織等篇、丙編中之高等敎育總述、中學總述等篇、戊編中之興學以來敎育大事記、敎科書之發刊概况、敎育先進傳略等篇、每一題材、窮源竟委、各成體系、則可云本年鑑之創格焉、</p>
<p>本年鑑材料之來源、約有數種可得而述、一爲各敎育行政機關、領事館、學校及學術研究機關團體依照調查表格塡報之事實、一爲本部所有新舊　　、一爲各敎育行政機關及學術研究機關團體之刊物、一爲各會局出　　於敎育事實的記載或論列之書報、筆一種尤爲基本要素、　由各司　訂定各方面所應呈　呈報事項、並附以概况要目調查表格等件、於二十一年五月三日　令、尅日指定事員、逐件作精確之塡報、以各省呈復參差、坐最延至今年一月底始克付印、</p>
<p>本年鑑稿件之統籌審查甲編、戊編由前編審處負責、特别專題、由特約編纂撰書、乙編由參事處負責、丙編高等敎育、國外留學、學術研究機關團體等概况、由高等敎育司負責、中等敎育、初等敎育、華僑敎育等概况、由普通敎育司負責、蒙藏敎育概况、由蒙藏敎育司負責、丁編由各司共同負責、丙編社會體育一篇、因事屬專門曾請郝史生、吳藴瑞二先生審查、蓋基於分工合作之原則也、</p>
<p>關於年鑑文件之擬稿、收發與登錄、初由周委員淦廿秘書處就便辦理、繼由編審委員會推定周委員淦與周主任編纂邦道共同負責、並專闢定、彙集參者書報、以傳各編纂之參考、分配呈送村料繕寫撰成稿件、則由書記從事工作、後周主任編纂因職務關係、須出外視學、不能常川在部、一切事宜、遂　由副主任編纂黄君問岐主持焉、</p>
<p>此次編纂進行、同人等事後談論、咸覺缺憾彌多、舉其要者、各種概况取材年度未能一致、且以來源關係亦無法一致此具、各方面所送材料、參差不齊、規定各種概况項目、並往往未盡備具無、可根據、遂多闕略、此其二、編審委員會之組織與編纂之設置不甚統貫調整實際上容有未便之處、此其三、編審委員及編纂關係兼職、必待本身職務行有餘暇、始能從事此項工作、精神未能專注、效率難免减損、此其四、編纂人員因公務鞅掌、幾乏暇晷聚集商討、體裁格式、詳略重輕、各自爲政事實具在、無可諱言、此其五、惟前事不忘、後事之師、第二次以後之敎育年鑑將較勝於第一次、殆可斷言乎、</p>

<p>痛陳過去悲壯之歷史與使命</p>
<p>願國人以正義呼應物質恊助</p>
<p>中國公學、自校長熊克武辭職後、校務早已乏人負責、該校學生、爲維護學校並本身學案計、曾組織請願團、向校董于右任等、請求遴選校長、復興校務、各情已註前報、兹悉該校畢業同學會爲復興母校、昨特發表告國人書、原文如下、</p>
<p>告國人書　緣我中公、爲反抗日帝國主義者之壓迫而成立、亦爲反抗日帝國主義者之壓迫而毁滅、春奮鬥之精神、豈僅爲我同學之光榮哉、乃自一二八禍變以後關懷者雖不乏人、而復興者殊少問津、致垂三十載光榮歷史之學校、幾從此消沉、能不痛乎、我畢業同學不忍坐視母校淪亡、爰將我中國公學巳往之歷史與使命、略述其梗概、以爲國人告、</p>
<p>反帝先聲　一、中國公學爲中華民族反帝之先聲、光緒三十一年、中國留日學生、爲反對日本新頒之取締學生規則、含憤歸國而創辦之中國公學啓我中華民立大學之肇端、含義旣深、　功尤偉、二、當時國内除二三敎會所辦之學校外、僅有專制政府所屬之京師大學、封建沿襲旣深、而監督尤嚴、黨人不能駐足、故雖有革命之計謀、而終少策動之塲合、我中公及時興起、黨人如章炳麟戴季陶于右任諸先生、及已故陳英士烈士等、卽長駐其間、藉敎學之名、奠革命之基、同學數百、莫不</p>
<p>充滿革命　之情緒、是以辛亥廣州之役、總理出走上海時於吳淞登匯、向母校提欵、學校當局卽助以基金三百萬　繼續革命之　、過兩京臨時敎府　立、臨時參　　　　　在清源　　銀統　欠政府官欵　下報　中公基金、並　孫總　·黄崑强·宋數年·　先生加入校董會、可知當日我中公爲本黨效力之勞績、及我黨體念中公　　矣、</p>
<p>先烈精神　三、中國公學　爲黨宣勞、國人在專制統治之下、莫不視爲怪物、匪　　　、且加詆毁、致學校前途、發生　　、總幹事姚烈士宏業先生、痛國人之踟蹶、憤民族之不振、憤而蹈海自殺、遺言數千、淋漓艷　、有云、「我之死爲中國公學死也、」又幹事張邦傑先生、爲監　校舍、盡瘁而死、凡此二公者、莫不爲中公而犧牲、是中公一日之存在、卽先烈之精神一日未死也、</p>
<p>燬於曇日　　嘻、中公本反帝之使命、具革命之光榮、卒被燬於暴日、我政府更從而令限結束、亦豈我同學所願聞、國人所願　歟、憶惜姚烈士有言曰、「中國公學不善中國民族能力之試金石、如不能成立發達、亦卽我全國人能力劣敗之代表也、」同學乎、國人乎、得亦甘爲能力劣敗之代表乎、</p>
<p>計劃復興　本會重膺我畢業同學之寄托、值此母校乏人負責、存亡生死之際、豈敢緘默、除催請校董會從速計劃復興、遴選才力俱備之校長來校主持、及呈請政府收回限期結束之成命、以維我國爭光、爲民族爭生存之母校外、謹此吉言、願國人予以正義之呼應、物質之恊助、中公幸甚、申華幸甚、</p>

<p>— 金子</p>
<p>這個題目翻起文言來，當然就是「處世秘訣」，可是「處世秘訣」這四個字似乎太陳舊了，寫出來决不能有什麽號召力，因此作者也不得不倣效老店新開的辦法，换一個題目用用。</p>
<p>在未論「做人的藝術」之前，作者還得先下一個代數式的下例，使讀者可以格外明瞭一些。</p>
<p>「做人的藝術不是籠統的，而是隨環境和時間而變化的」。</p>
<p>所以，我們在這裏討論的做人的藝術，實在祗是做了一個現代的中國人的藝術，適用的時間，也許是十年，也許是一年，也許祇短短的幾個月，總之，待到中國的政治走上了正軌，中國的社會止住了騷擾，這種種做人的藝術的夀命，便可以同時宣告終了。</p>
<p>從前人不談處世秘訣則巳，一談處世秘訣，便老是拍馬屁，吹牛比那幾套，其實到現在巳經不能適用；現在所適用的只有三個字，便是「狠」，「巧」，「快」，三個字。</p>
<p>狠　在現在這個世界上，我們雖不能公然率獸食人，或是痛痛快快的隨便殺人，却也不能過於膽小，過於慈悲，只要對於你自己有利的話，儘可不管别人的死活，隨意幹袁；如果你覺得某人對你有何妨礙，你就該立卽下手把他除去，而且必須把他連根剷除，不能讓他再有報復的機會。總括說　句，肚腸必須愈硬愈好，切不可顧什麽天理人情，那你才有飯吃！</p>
<p>巧　拍馬屁，吹牛比原是做中國人的一種最高明的藝術，到現在因爲會吹會拍的人委實太多了，所以才有些不大靈騐；但是倘你能匠心别運，另想一種巧妙的拍法，吹法出來，還是可以换洋錢的！</p>
<p>快　這個字比較上最重要，你要如單有了「狠」的肚腸，「巧」的心思，而没有「快」的手段，你在這幾年的中國裏，一定還不能立足，就是能够立足，也依舊逃不了受氣，挨駡，餓肚皮。因爲現在中國整個的社會，巳成了一片搶飯吃的世界，處處要講先下手爲强，你必須時時事事存着跑百碼的心理，跟人家角逐，那麽你就是不能得到多大便宜，也斷不爲儘吃虧了！</p>
<h3 id="c250">嗜好 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 周黎民</p>
<p>『嗜好』一名詞係指一人的職業以外興趣所在的各方面。</p>
<p>它的種類甚多，如喝酒，打牌，吸烟，書畫，看電影，玩古董等均是，我國人常常告誡人要遏制嗜好，我以爲很有商榷的餘地。</p>
<p>人們在世界上實在並非爲生存而生存，我們「貪生怕死」，所貪者並非生命，乃生活所給予我們的種種滿足與享有；可怕者並非死亡，乃死後種種滿足與享有的剥奪，所以一人對於環境中感覺興趣的方法愈多，或者可以說嗜好愈多，則其生活愈豐富，愈有意義，愈不肯抛棄生命。</p>
<p>所以消極者，厭世者，自殺者，大概興趣是單方面的，缺乏嗜好的，因爲他除本身職務外，没有旁的嗜好，無家庭之樂，無朋友之誼，而他對於本身職務並不感覺得興趣，生活當然無意味了。</p>
<p>一人戀愛了，生活有意義，就是爲着他的情人，生命與愛情變成一而二，二而一，不幸他失戀了，生活便失掉意義，他厭世了，他自殺了；多少因失戀而自殺的青年，所經過的歷程是如此的！</p>
<p>所以凡人如太專心於一方面，把别的方面完全抛棄而隔絕，一日對於他所進行的方面失意時，就有消極，厭世，自殺的危險。</p>
<p>從心理方面研究起來，嗜好是不應該遏制的，而應該多方培植的；有益於身心的嗜好都是值得提倡的。</p>
<h3 id="c251">熱被窩 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>寒風凍冽，氣候凝寒，人們因爲守着「日出而作，日入而息」的古訓，在這冬天裏邊，憑你氣候寒冷到怎樣程度，他們在白天裏，除非臥在牀上害病，總要起來工作，吃喝　矢，以求一天生活之舒適，冬天是動物蟄伏時期，人類因賦有活動的身體，靈敏的頭腦，不耐着忍饑耐餓，所以雖然在冰天雪地的環境裏挣扎着，他們的心靈，仍是在活躍，他們的身體，仍是在蠢動。</p>
<p>冬天的風，刮在人身上，委實　刀割，冬天的氣候，包圍在人們四週，眞是一點熱氣都没有，嘘寒唤冷，終日勞作，人們唯一的慰藉，是夜晚所裹臥的熱被窩，八小時工作，八小時休息，八小時睡眠，被窩是人們安藏身體的倉庫，在冬天裏邊，熱被窩的價值，人們視之，眞是一座神秘的，和暖的，值得享樂留戀的安樂之宫。</p>
<p>熱被窩的組織，必要的物件，是被與褥，照富有知識的人類的頭腦看起來，這種最低限度的享樂，在人類生活環境上，當然個個可以享受，但是理解是理解，事實是事實，在這冬之夜裏，富人的被窩，是軟綿綿的，熱烘烘的，窮人的被窩，是挺硬的，是冷瑟瑟的，熱被窩委實是富人享受的專用品，窮人的身體，只會遮在冰窖似的大蔴袋，和廣告紙做的被筒裏蹲臥着。</p>
<p>熱被窩最令人艷羨的，要算青年男女，新婚燕爾的少年夫婦，他們包裹其中，卿卿我我，兩情繾綣，他們簡直視熱烘烘的被窩中，和神秘的魔宫一樣，但是回顧沿黄河所受水災的災民，在這冬天裏，日無棉衣禦寒，夜無棉被裹身，熱被窩的享樂，他們委實是無緣領受！</p>
<p>吾人處在這冰窖似的冬夜，霜是滿地舖着，風是替人們呐喊着，我國四萬萬同胞，睡熱被窩的人，比較没有熱被窩可睡，究竟是多呢？還是少呢？這恐怕無需請敎統計家，我們可以猜度出來，所以「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」，襄大蔴袋，蓋靡告紙，凍死是命短的，有命的人，是永遠死不掉的。</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>余卽據事實與理由一一反駁，說：「說服煤油的利害，完全爲分量問題，譬如嗎啡與阿司比林等藥，着過量服之，亦要發生危險，煤油原是安全無毒的東西，比火酒燒酒要安全幾百倍，飮服煤油一定的分量，從學問上實騐上可以證明的材料很多，若認爲違反德義，請把害處指點出來。」那醫師不敢再有申辯，這是名爲醫師，對於煤油認識不足，誠爲醫藥界的大恥哇。總之，煤油對於肺病，認全部都有特效，然而爲什麽有特效，因爲煤油中含有特殊的成分，其特殊成分的分離，爲提供醫學者的臨床實騐，當有詳細說明發表。飮服的方法，照余的經騐，第一次試飮五克蘭姆，隔了三四日又飮　次，假使飮後發生腹瀉，嘔吐頭痛發熱等反應，暫時停止，若是没有副作用，那再增加至一·二克蘭姆，仍舊隔三四天飮一次，飮的時間，在臨臥以前空腹飮服，最大飮量，初期患者二十克蘭姆，一期患者十五克蘭姆，吐血或患第三期者七·五克蘭姆，飮的時間與隔離日數，要十分注意，普通少量飮服，與中國藥大黄的性質相同，可作健胃劑用，飮後難起腹瀉，或體温昇高，但爲一時的，切勿掛心，且飮後必能增進食慾，精神爽爽快，又與其他藥品併用，亦無妨害，煤油的種類，以普通點燈用的均可，油色帶微黄，混有不潔物百分之○·四的最宜，上等的煤油，反不宜飮</p>

<p>第二十五回涙臉送人辭家歸速戍　風沙澈夜出寨駐孤城</p>
<p>天呀，放亮光進來，放情人出去。這兩句歌謡，在古來就盛傳着，多麽哀怨可是到了楊桂枝這時，不是放情人出去，乃是促新婚未久的丈夫遠去，不但哀怨，簡直是悽慘了。所以趙自强說了一聲要走，桂枝握住了自强的手，半嚮說話不得。自强低聲道，你心裏不要難受，我到了前方，立刻寫信給你，我一面在那附近村子裏找一所房，咱們舒舒服服的，到那裏過日子去，你看怎麽樣？桂枝道：那自然是好，不過這件事並不緊要。我希望你一切都要謹愼。自强握住了他的手，只管摇撼着，那裏還說得出别的什麽話來。正在這時，聽到對過的房門，吚呀的響着，趙翁已在堂屋裏喊着道：自强，你起來了嗎？自强立刻開着門，迎了出來道：爸爸，我起來着呢。趙翁道：我聽到你兩口子說了一宿的話，難道没有睡嗎？自强道：這樣說，您大概也是没睡吧？同時院子裏有了亂雜的步履聲，江氏在外面帶了哆嗦的聲音道：你們都起來啦。自强的行李檢好了没有？桂枝連忙開着堂屋門道：媽也是一宿没有睡呢。自强笑着向江氏鞠了躬道：老太太也起來得這樣早呢。大家說着話，都站在堂屋裏，没個作道理處，彷彿各人心裏，都有什麽病似的，只是慌亂着。還是桂枝清楚些，首先將自强的悶殻子表，拿來替他放在袋裏。一面將檢理好了的一隻提箱，一隻皮包，一齊放在堂屋裏椅子上。（三二三）</p>

<p>瑞典首都斯都克爾摩的警察署長，最近决意把當地所有夜總會嚴行禁止，直至夜總會絕跡而止，因爲歷來所有案件，都在夜總會内發生。向來夜總會在瑞典，祗頒每星期繳税五金鎊，便可公然營業，得獲巨大的利益，但這種地方，爲歹人集跡之處，夜總會的數量愈多，所發生的姦盜自殺等案也愈多，因此，爲維持都市安寗計，這一次瑞典的警局，便决定先由首都着手，從事取締夜總會。</p>

<h3 id="c261">麻將哲學 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 孟眞</p>
<p>除了梅蘭芳，中國文明之能發揚於海外的，怕要首推麻將了。</p>
<p>麻將何以能得人歡迎呢？因爲這百三十六張當中，包含了我們中國的人生哲學。碰，吃，和三字，實說明了我們人間的一切。</p>
<p>抹牌最要緊的是對子能够碰倒，順子嵌當能够吃着，那末和就很有把握了。我們中國人的生活也是這樣，只要運氣好，機會巧，一路順風，就可以由書記而主席，由馬弁而督辦，倘若奬券能够中了頭彩，那末不但名流聞人，可以唾手而致，並且要做什麽長或主任之類，也大是易事。所以我們中國人最注意的是天命，卜筮星相，能被斥爲迷信，却依舊是社會的流行，上至黨國要人，下至車夫苦力，莫不拳拳服膺。</p>
<p>然而雖曰天命，亦有關人事。手風好時，雖是誰都可以和一色三翻，但是到了手風不順的時候，則精於抹牌者，也可以輸錢較少。因此，一方面雖相信天命，而他方面也說人定可以勝天。</p>
<p>還有，八圈麻將，往往忽勝忽負，波浪重疊，令人爲之喜，爲之怒，把一切都完全忘懷，在這當中，却始終抱着一種希望，贏錢的希望能够更贏，輸錢的則能够翻本。這有如人對於生活的執着，無論如何非到絕望，不願放棄其生的意志而自殺。</p>
<p>在一個社會，旣然有的人只要機緣巧合，卽毫無生活技能，亦可坐享最優美的生活資料，而有的人則雖很有才能，却潦倒終身。麻將的游戲方法，無怪是一種最相當的表現了。其實一切的社會關係，業已固定。表面上說是運命，說是人定亦可以勝天者，無非藉以取消鬥爭的意識，保持旣存社會的安定而已。因爲若由人定勝天主義言，舊的不合理的闊係，儘可以人力來打破，但是在麻將中，却始終逃不了手風主義的支配。所以雖說人事，還是全部關係天命。</p>
<p>麻將産生在封建的有閒階級支配下的中國，至二十世紀，乃流行於資本主義的有閒階級支配下的美國，這是有其由來的。因爲中國與美國的不同，不過一在封建剥削的最高階段，一在資本主義榨取的極峯而已。</p>
<h3 id="c262">悲劇的喜劇（續） <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>他按照他的計畫進行，不到三個月，這小邑裏幾乎没有一家没有病人臥在床上了，甚至可以說全邑的人都在病着。小邑中有唯一的一家旅館，從前生意是非常冷清的，可是現在没有一間空房，完全裝滿了病人，旅館變成病院了。</p>
<p>三個月之後那位從前讓給克洛克這地盤的醫生帕爾帕雷再到這小邑來收賬時，他的驚異便非同小可了。可是克洛克用不了三言五句的解說，就使他不再驚異了，帕爾帕雷明白了那道理，可是他的良心裏不能容受，於是作者製造了下面的對話：</p>
<p>帕爾帕雷　如果我有着你的方法，如果我像你一樣確確實實的有着這方法………如果有着這現成的方法祇要我去實行的話……</p>
<p>克洛克　我懂啦。</p>
<p>帕爾帕雷　我不會感到什麽不安嗎？（沉默）請回答我呀。</p>
<p>克洛克　但我覺得這是應當由你自己回答的。</p>
<p>帕爾帕雷　你看我什麽都不說明。我只挑出最婉曲的一點。</p>
<p>（沉默）</p>
<p>克洛克　我不大了解你的話。</p>
<p>帕爾帕雷　你一定會說我太嚴格，太細心。可是在你的方法裏面，病人的利益不是有點以醫生的利益爲前提麽？</p>
<p>克洛克　帕爾帕雷醫生，你忘記有一種比這兩種利益更高的利益啦？</p>
<p>帕爾帕雷　什麽利益呢？</p>
<p>克洛克　醫學的利益，這就是我所專心致力的唯一　的利益。</p>
<p>其次帕爾帕雷更問他：「可是你總不能把一邑的人全弄在床上呀！」他却一面揩手一面說：「這層還有討論的餘地。因爲我親自見過一家五個人，同時害病，同時臥床，而他們却對付得很好。……」由這我們可以明白，這醫生的理由是多麽充分！</p>
<p>也許有人會疑心這個醫生不是眞實的，但對於我他是再眞實没有的了。我們平素所看見的醫生多少都有點像這位克洛克先生。不過顯在舞臺上的這個克洛克，是太明白自己了，他把他一切的行爲都分析清楚，而世上一般的醫生是没有這麽意識明顯的。他能說出口來他是爲着「醫學的勝利」，而許多醫生雖然也那麽相信着那麽實行着，却連自己也不明白。帕爾帕雷雖然能說「病人的利益不是有點兒以醫生的利益爲前提麽？」然而他在實際上也未嘗不是那樣的，只不過他没有克洛克那樣的才幹。這不是很好的證明麽？丨他馬上又要和克洛克换位子了，他願意把他里昻的位子讓出，而再回到這小邑來。</p>
<p>全劇的最緊要的地方，就在上面引過來的那場對話裏，兩個醫生的面孔都變成嚴肅的了，讀者和觀衆也就不能再笑下去。那是指示出一種我們平素輕忽過去了的眞理，而我們就當明白這眞理時，仍然毫無辦法；至少在這社會没有根本的大變革之前，那是毫無辦法的。</p>
<p>讀完了這個劇本，像我曾經讀「兩個伊凡吵架的故事」或「阿Ｑ正傳」似地，我是懷了一顆沉重的心，甚過一切悲劇所給與的力，所以我稱這劇是「悲劇的喜劇。」</p>
<h3 id="c263">和涙的酒 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 埜容</p>
<p>依紅輕啓口齒，一杯酒直灌下去，利刀似的從喉頭割裂了一下，不禁大嗆起來。客人們笑了，姊妹們也笑了。她覺得滿臉發燒，喉中還不住的刺痛。</p>
<p>「再來一杯」那大胖子擎起滿滿的一杯酒，喊起來。他那推着横肉的臉上，就像燒着的炭似的，紅得發光。他把酒直送到依紅的口邊，鼻子裏呼呼的出氣。</p>
<p>她忙用手推開了，然而他依舊送着，口中說，「不喝不行，…不行。」衆人都拍手笑喊，有的更離開座席奔了過來。依紅哭喪着臉，望望衆人，客人們正在起勁，姊妹們都苦笑着在旁觀。她巳經失了援助，像一匹遇難的羔羊似的，幾乎想哭出來。</p>
<p>那胖子也斜着眼，舉着杯，酒從杯口灑下來，酒杯在他手中抖動。「喝，老張的酒可以喝，我的也可以喝了。喝，要喝。」</p>
<p>她心上好像有一把火要噴出來。她恨不得一拳打破那兩隻乜縫的眼睛。然而她把頭偏過來，不曾動手。她覺得有一股眼淚，快要奪眶而出。但她立時記起阿媽說過，要把笑臉當作我們的眼涙的話來。於是她死命忍住了。她感到頭目昏眩，摇摇欲倒。一屈身便坐下了。</p>
<p>有人走過來說着好話，然而胖子不答應。一隻佈滿了青筋的粗大的手掌伸過來，把她的臉撥過去，酒從她鼻下一霎時澆了她一脖子。她耳邊還聽見噹啷一聲，酒杯在地下打碎了。</p>
<p>她如夢初醒，屈辱立時咬着她的心，一跳身站起來，也不管冰冷的酒從脖下直淋到心窩，轉身要走。她覺得她四肢都在抖顫。但她一舉步却被人拉住了。</p>
<p>「走嗎，更要你喝。看你走到什麽地方去。」</p>
<p>那胖子喘着氣，一隻手緊緊的握着她的膀膊，握得發痛。他已經雙眼通紅，如像一匹怒吼的野獸。依紅滿身都像被火焚着似的，她忘了一切了。她舉手在那粗臂上下死勁地擊了一下，那胖子的手緊了一緊，忽而哈哈的笑起來。</p>
<p>「好，你打得好。」他喝了一聲，另一隻手高高的舉起來，一個巨石般粗大的拳頭懸在空中。客人和姊妹們圍過來了。立刻有人伸着無數的手，拉着，扯着。依紅乘隙脱出手來，裸着的臂膀上，齊齊地露出四條灰白的指痕。</p>
<p>忙亂的中間，依紅被拖下樓梯。她聽見樓上一片盌碟的碎聲。乘上包車，倉皇地走入燈炬輝煌的街市。她如碎如痴，不知道她今晚作了一回什麽事。眼淚從臉上斷珠般落下來，她也忘記了。她腮上還留着剛才的酒痕。……</p>

<p>— 高植</p>
<p>回家前，從南京經過，搭京蕪長途汽車，買票時，上車時，都顯得無秩序與擁擠；從公司方面看，這便顯得公家機關辦事欠周全，盡量售票而不管乘客上車後的擁擠，有的竟摇蕩數小時而無坐位，站時腰又伸不直。途中看見小孩子用石子摔車。汽車要擺渡過河，費時費事。</p>
<p>在蕪湖街上走了一趟，看見許多不似乞丐而穿着尚不破爛的從農村裏擠到城市中來逃荒要飯的人。聽到馬路上的工人們說，「鄉裏眞不得了，一年不如一年了。」</p>
<p>從蕪湖有小輪船到巢縣，正遇「拚班」的時候，單班票價四角，雙班票價二角，。票價不論長途短途，概是一律。在不「拚班」時，這條航綫的習俗算是長江内河小輪航綫習俗最壞中的一個。「接江」的覇佔艙位與公司方面自由定價都使旅客不便。一切顯得無秩序，無定規。爲要多看一點東西，我也坐大客艙中。聽許多搭客說，「一生不出門，是貴人。」在長江流域有車舟行駛處旅客所感受的不便於此也可見一斑。這里當然也有長江大輪船上的「推擠」現象。船上吸雅片者頗多。艙中的眞正「民衆」大談英雄奇俠傳上的故事，他們大概在二三十年後或者才會看新文學，此乃事實問題，與動聽的理論無關。</p>
<p>在巢縣住棧房（卽旅館），三角錢一天，還有一頓十碗菜的飯吃，實甚廉美。但市况比之十一年前情形，蕭條何止一倍。再坐汽車一小時便到了家，車與路都不好。車道經過一小山頂，據說開闢這山頂的報銷是十萬，實際上則所費有限，而全路線是農民攤工築成的，一文工資也不見發下，近於築長城時的新式「農役」，報銷如何，則頗難知確數。爲何要做官的理由，此也是一點。</p>
<p>在家鄉我又有機會和各種人接觸，把内地情形温習一遍，看見一點破落農村中人民的生活實况。他們没有敎育，十九是文盲；他們没有錢，十九要負債。他們要過舊曆新年，我略知他們爲何生活難改善，而所謂上邊的老爺爲何要榨取他們。他們有的要借一塊錢買年飯米也是千難萬難的事，把公雞提到街上换錢過年也難能如意，有的要來回走數百里到蕪湖去押當（小城市當舖不開，原因甚多，）但有的還不幸要中途遇到刦路的土匪，這種匪都有新式武器。然而他們要過年，要燒香燒紙，要吸香烟，點洋油，吃洋糖，用洋紗織布，單以一縣中一區的商業情形來看，洋油和香烟的商店可一年賺五萬元以上，然而眞正賺錢的不是中國人，消費者却大多是農民。土産不值錢，米賣不上四元一擔，花生仁二三元一擔，這生活呌農民如何過！再看一個人口不過一萬多的小市鎭，便有二百家烟館，每晚人滿，各種商店在臘月裏生意清淡，獨烟館照常景氣。故普通人看黑飯之重要不亞於白飯。在普通人家，敬雅片烟是和敬香烟一樣地成了社交禮節，否則便是不敬，没有面子。通衢上有牌子寫着如種烟者處死刑，但地方上却有正式的「土店。」</p>
<p>我到合肥去了一次。這一帶的情形都彷彿。農村是衰落了，大家在掙扎，但瘦瘠的農民却要掮着胖胖的老爺們玩耍各樣文武全行的把戲。許多村婦和村童都生得强健聰明，但和男子們一樣，没有敎育，都要成爲文盲，制御這些無知的窮百姓卽未讀過洋書的土劣官爺們也可以弄得很好。我不敢企望這個社會將有什麽希望。内地過舊曆新年，貼門對，放爆竹，過了年的結果是加了許多倒閉的大小商店，和無數的失業店員與工人。鄉村裏不能容納他們，城市裏也不能容納他們，談好聽的話是「移民」，但不知有什麽地方實在可移。他們又不能輪流地上一次臺，括點錢過一生，於是處處同聲呌窮了。</p>

<p>兩天以後丨鄂多向我要一件紀念品。我送他一支帽上的逼針。但他喜歡我的金剛石的髮針。我懂得了他的暗示。我是他的最寳貴的人兒，猶如金剛石是我的寳物中之最寳貴的。</p>

<p>今天早晨丨昨天，鄂多又向我要一件紀念品。我拿出一塊金幣，呌他折做兩半。鄂多不願意。我猜着了他的思想。他怕這會把我們的愛情折斷，他把整塊的金幣藏了，表示我們的愛情一致。這思想多巧妙啊！</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>次日丨我剛纔拿另一塊金幣給他。他把一個銅的戈貝同我交换。我又懂得了。我們的愛情永遠如金之純潔，銅之堅固。</p>
<p>我恐怕亞歷克西回來，又怕鄂多會殺掉他。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>後來丨我對鄂多說起亞歷克西。我說我是他的未婚妻。起初，鄂多一點不回答。他恐怕自己一怒而不可遏。後來他收拾畫具，預備走了。於是，我告訴他，亞歷克西還没有來。鄂多這纔安靜了，重新拿出他的畫筆。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>三天後丨亞歷克西半月後就要來了。我對鄂多說，我們應該自殺。我們的愛情要求我們如此。鄂多提議，呌我先自殺，然後他到我的墳前絕食而死。</p>

<h3 id="c309">青年女性自殺潮 <a href="#c309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>青年女性自殺，已由偶爾發生而逐漸頻繁的廣泛起來，在這廢歷元旦前後，幾乎是盛極一時；還不知幾許煩惱苦悶的青年女性，正要走入這「大休息」以求人生的大解脱的路道。我們若不將這一事實隨便看作茶餘飯後「話題」的「小事」，便會注意到牠的嚴重，因爲這是無容諱言的，青年女性的自殺，已經不是可以興奮的偶然事件，事實上已成爲使人腦經麻痺的普遍現象丨然而是不可輕視的潮流。</p>
<p>在還自陽回初九臘鼓聲催的時候，有投考學校未得取錄因而自殺的學生胡眞，與乎欠薪不發反遭侮辱辭退便萌「厭世」的敎員黄汕，至在此新春佳節萬家皆樽開百壽醉飮屠蘇之際，更其是「與歳更始」，變本加厲。首先是以主演「現代一女性」因而大見聲譽於社會的影星艾霞吞烟自裁，次則有被未婚夫遺棄的嚴氏少女訴寃泉下，以及蜚聲章臺的妓女麗文遽行「短見。這些「貿然輕生」的人，雖然其類無倫，其品各别，但是她們的爲青年女性則一，爲青年女性之自殺，與乎自殺所表現於眼前的社會性質則一。</p>
<p>這些青年女性的厭世自戕，其原因有的是爲歷盡人生艱苦，痛感經濟壓迫；有的憧憬着「戀愛至上」的象牙之宫，倐遭幻滅的失望；有的是傾慕可使女子自驕的虚榮，尋求不得；有的是飽經人世的閱歷，畢竟逃不出社會人心的險巇奸詐。不管怎樣，我們若不彷效新聞記者的態度去尋根問底，追求事實，便能够綜合得出一個這些女性所以自殺，而且成爲「風盛一時」之潮流的根本問題。</p>
<p>現時之所謂「婦女解放，男女平等，婚姻自由」的新口號，在社會内部人與人間尚自不能「平等自由解放」之時，正掩藏着不少玩弄女子奴役女子之「自由」的實質，尤其是一些正自驕人自驕的「摩登」青年女性。因爲而今之所謂「愛情，在金錢萬能的環境下完全等於刻在「花邊」上的袁大頭，有了牠便有「愛」，有牠便甚麽「濃情密意」也不存在。在這一「眞理」之下，使許多祖宗有德的公子哥兒及大亨，利用金錢的力量來實行「愛」的大量收買；而許多「摩登」少女也自朝思暮想，以嫁得「金龜婿」爲快。但是旣已有錢卽「愛」，在數度問津以身相許之後，又那能保得終身相從而不棄如敝屣，這就使得許多滿懷太太奶奶之夢的青年女子不能不遭「遺棄」而「失戀」了。不過汽車與洋房的惑力，終竟使得一般「摩登一女子神往，這就使許多失去這一炫耀的想望的女性，也不能不「厭世」。</p>
<p>雖然如此，目前也有不少的熱情女郎懸想着在這交際場中，找尋個一往情深的終身伴侣；只是這樣的「茶花女」，竟難碰到當年的「阿芒」，使得她深感「情塲多幻」無復生人之趣便棄世戕生了。至於許多没有在此「情塲」一爭勝負，而命定成爲機械奴隸的女子，在生活絕望中雖不定便行自殺，但已逼迫她走入慢性自殺之途。</p>
<p>女子經濟之不能獨立，驅使着她們日益以「摩登」爲標榜，相率實行「愛」的拍賣，而屢屢演成遺棄失戀與自殺的結果；同時在金錢買愛的社會中，更造成了她們的極度「虚榮」，但是時時感到「幻滅」。自然，這一現象將隨經濟恐慌之加深而日盛，使青年女子走入自殺的「潮流，如果女子經濟不能獨立及形成女子經濟不能獨立的制度没有變遷時，恐怕青年女子的自殺要成爲「方興未艾」而且「每况愈下」的嚴重問題罷。</p>
<h3 id="c310">觀無名劇人恊會二次公演記 <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— 雪菲</p>
<p>最近有上海無名劇人恊會，爲援助失業工人和上海市的减租運動，於本月二十六日在湖社二次公演話劇。日夜共兩場。我出看的是夜戲，是這樣的四幕戲：（一）流浪者，（二）弟兄，（三）一百金鎊，（四）同住三家。四幕戲前五幕大概是外國的劇本罷，後一幕「同住之家」同是自己新編的，其内容則是描寫最近上海房租負担的痛苦。</p>
<p>四幕戲中，最博觀衆彩聲的，是「一百金鎊」。這一幕戲的内容，大概這樣的：「在愛爾蘭某河岸旁邊，一位英國警長佇候着一個逃獄的革命黨人，期圖捉拿他去换一百鎊的賞格。可是那愛爾蘭的革命黨人并不像懸賞裏所描摹的那裏。另外一個賣唱的窮漢，奏着六弦琴，唱着動人的歌。警告把他當作他所要抓的人。可是，他以他的機智不但避免了警長的懷疑，同時說服他，從他的掌握裏逃脱。「一百鎊懸賞，一百鎊！」警告空着兩手問自己是不是一個儍瓜」。（據說明書）。情節也甚乎常，無甚曲折，但劇中人的表演，是好極了。尤其是對白，句句有力，句句幽默，眞是妙到亳顚，没有一句不有極深長的意味。聽着如飮醇醪，如讀有名的詩句，只覺通身暢快，無所不可。這固然由於劇本本來編得好，但劇中人能够恰如其分的表演出來，這就更使全劇精髓，没有一點遺漏的完全表襮了出來了。我們看，他（劇中人丨賣唱的窮漢），一舉一動，一言一語，是多麽含有極深長而豐富的詩意。他的衣服是極端襤褸的，面目是骯髒的，腿子又是跨着的，然而同時，他的言語却是諷刺的，行動是詭異的，同時也可說是渾脱而高超的，更進一步，我們又可窺見他内心的熱情是特别奔放的，而思想則是極端冷靜的。呵，這是一個多麽可愛的人啊！任他形容是怎樣的醜陋，然而我們只覺其可愛。不獨可愛，拿來和高貴體面的紳士少爺太太小姐們一比，我們並且只覺得其餘的體面人，倒有些不像人，而唯有這位形容醜陋的賣唱的窮漢，才是唯一眞正的人！這是一個多麽深刻而有力的諷刺！這一深刻而有力的諷刺，演劇者是把他一絲不漏的完全把捉到觀衆面前來了。我想，我對於戲劇雖是外行，但這一幕戲，觀衆總不能不說他是很成功的罷。</p>
<p>其次，「流浪者」中的「勞蕾」，「同住之家」中的「陳桂卿」，和「素薇之母」，表演也各有相當成功。演勞蕾者描寫一般小資産階級（勞蕾雖是工人，然而他是一個工頭，他的意識是小資産階級的，他曾經做過資本家的走狗）特具的意特沃羅基，可謂精刻入微。「同住之家一中的陳桂卿，醉態可掬，言語和行動，都十分幽默。素薇之母，活是一個無知老婦，不知演怎麽這樣奇趣横生的描摹了出來，口吻如畫眞虧演者想得到，做得出。</p>
<p>總觀各劇，雖然鬆懈和粗疏處很多，但有這一點成績，我們也很可滿足了</p>
<p>日前，我們幾乎無戲可着。電影，不是僅僅熱鬧和繁華，便是内容完全被歪曲了。難得有這麽一次話劇的公演，倒多少給我們多少精神上的食糧罷。雖然他的内容不一定怎樣進步的，然而就這樣也好。因此，最後我是希望上海前進的戲劇界，有機會能多給我們多幾次的公演。</p>

<h3 id="c311">歸來吧，我的孩子！ <a href="#c311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>在肅靜的亭子間裏面，可以聽到隔壁的鐘扣了五下，可不是嗎？一天又是這樣的過去了，口袋裏的幾個小錢又是這樣的化費了，天天早起，坐緊在臺子的前面，拿着筆，究竟不知道寫什麽好，寫點文章，可以賣些錢來維持生活，補救你在失業的期中，這種暫時的生活方法，似乎很容易，也似乎很困難，照今天我低着頭，坐了一天，不知寫出龍還是虎？自己却覺得疲倦十分，頭裏也痛，我想非跑到外邊去换一下新空氣不行。</p>
<p>僅僅就是在我出去到回來的五十分之間，這個可恨的五十分鐘，當我剛踏進衖口，小使女阿豆愴惶的向馬路跑，她經過我的面前却没有看見我，我想她是趕着要買東西燒飯，很隨便的呌她一聲：『阿豆！你上那兒去？』她的視綫一轉到我的臉上的時候，她的手抓住我的衣服，兩隻脚跪到地上，她喊着：『不好呀！弟弟不見了！不過一霎的工夫呢！不好啦，啥地方去找呢？』她說了又站起來，轉到警察跟前，又是跪民下來用着同樣驚急的聲調向他求助，那警察先生也許是經騐過多，看慣了人家失小孩子似的，他並不同情，他還從容的說：『那麽你四處去找一找好了！誰呌你不當心？』</p>
<p>我看了這種情形，自己巳經麻木了幾分，他失路，他被人帶走，我將怎樣去找他回來？我的心作慌作痛，但並没有哭出來，很快的跳上黄包車，一直駛至横浜橋區所，在坐辦公室的人，他掀開一個部子呌我塡寫，我把姓名年歳寫好之後，我開始愼重的質問他：『我這樣寫了，你們可以把我的孩子找回來嗎？别人家的小孩失了都可以找着吧？都不可以吧？你們用什麽方法替我找呢？你不快些嗎？你怎樣坐着不動？我非找着他不行的！『我不管他給我什麽回答，萬分性急，只知道追問他，這個辦公的人，他看我太奇怪了，他算是有良心的，最後答應我可以打個電話到别的區所去敎他們多替我注意。</p>
<p>『注意！注意就行了嗎？若是我有錢，我丢了我的紙票在你們的桌子上，那麽火車站，馬路巷口，十字街邊，什麽地方不可把那個騙子抓住？把我的孩子搶回來？算了吧！我的孩子就算從你們的手裏送給人家，你想他今天晚上要怎樣哭？怎樣去找他的母親？注意，注意就算了嗎？好先生！』這一段瘋狂的喊呌，把那位辦公的先生氣得站起來，拍着桌子，他要和我計較，我記得，當時旁邊還有一個穿着軍衣的人，他勸勸他，又把我送出門口，那時候我的眼涙才從深深的眼裏滾下來。</p>
<p>坐上黄包車，它把我拉回家，門口站着好些女人，她們議論紛紛，但不從實際上帮我找他，儘用口在說，我不由得恨她們，我懊悔剛才到外邊去散步，更恨我所寫的文章，它能賣得什麽錢？我的孩子失了，什麽代價呢？啊！他也許是給人藏在隔壁的屋子裏，但，只要别人有意作惡，那麽雖然我們是同在上海，同在一條馬路，甚至同在一條衖裏，我們却仍然是永遠隔絕，别離，他呌着他的媽媽，他不能聽見他媽媽的應聲，他是如何的可憐！我不明白人家爲什麽要使他失了母親的愛護，把他從我的懷抱中搶去？縱使他可以賣錢，但值得多少？二十塊吧？上帝曉得！一雙太太的絲襪子掛在公司的玻璃窗裏面，不是也標着大洋二十幾塊嗎？…………</p>

<p>— 兪梅</p>
<p>墻外有人的脚步聲時，三姑娘便醒了。她從被筒裏探出頭，掀起帳子，看見關着的木窗縫裏有一絲白光透到房裏，她又縮到被裏去了，把赤條條的熱身子向男的貼緊了一點。</p>
<p>男人的疲倦還未恢復過來，呼吸聲還是均匀的。三姑娘舐了舐他的唇和下顎，他依然睡得很酣。三姑娘在他身上摸撫了一會，怕驚醒了這男人，便先離開了身子穿了上衣，聽到外邊巳很有行人的脚步聲了。</p>
<p>她到老虎灶去冲了水，洗過臉，把男人也呌醒了。男人穿着衣服。她把洗面水打好，放在桌上。把床上的一塊布放進了櫃下隔，向男人會意地默笑。</p>
<p>外面有脚步聲，是丈夫回來了。她連忙走了出去，看見了丈夫是空着手的，却有點奇怪爲什麽丈夫臉上有了一抹笑容。她問，</p>
<p>「烟灰帶回來了没有？」</p>
<p>「忘記了。」男人笑着。</p>
<p>「快去討來，我馬上要煮土，家裏灰不够。」</p>
<p>徐三懷着另一種喜悦去了。房内的男人一邊扣着衣服，一邊說要走。</p>
<p>「臉不是没有洗麽？」</p>
<p>「回去洗了。衣料我有空就送來。」男人笑了一下，就出了大門。</p>
<p>她站到門外看他走遠了。街上的泥淖又都結成了一層玄冰，墻邊上還是有雪堆，堆上有一層黑灰。對面的屋頂上瓦溝裏的積雪是白皚皚的。</p>
<p>徐三拿着烟灰笑着走進房時，她對丈夫的不滿不若昨夜之甚了。徐三把烟灰遞給了她，顯得特别温柔起來，坐到床邊，問道，</p>
<p>「你頭痛不痛了？」</p>
<p>「睡了一夜，好不少了。」</p>
<p>徐三從荷包中慢慢地掏出一張五元鈔票和兩塊錢。</p>
<p>三姑娘驚喜地問：「是不是人家把的烟錢？」</p>
<p>「不是的，烟還没有賣掉一半呢。還有人在燒。」</p>
<p>「那末，那裏來的呢？」</p>
<p>「揀的。」</p>
<p>「在那裏揀的？」</p>
<p>「在賭塲裏的桌子腿下揀的。」</p>
<p>「是昨晚上還是今早上？」</p>
<p>「是半夜的時候。」</p>
<p>「幸虧我要你去銷烟，才會發外快財。今年定要轉運了。」</p>
<p>「我累死了。你把這個錢先收着。我想睡一下。」</p>
<p>「好，你睡吧。」</p>
<p>「你陪我。」</p>
<p>「我陪你？烟不煮麽？」</p>
<p>「烟明天煮吧。」徐三說着，把鞋脱了。</p>
<p>「對了，我還没有秤土够不够。下半天先到小玉子家借二兩添起來煮吧。」</p>

After twenty minutes, he boarded the original plane again and left Xiamen at 1:15 PM, flying to Guangzhou. Zhao and others accompanied him. Jiang met with reporters at Daqian and gave a five-minute speech. The main points: 1. He advocated for the complete incorporation of the Fujian militia. The good ones would be transferred to suppress bandits, and the others would be organized into security teams, currently presided over by Chairman Chen. He had provided his opinions to Chairman Chen, and there was a satisfactory solution. 2. Historically, Jiangxi Province has been tightly controlled on the northern and western routes, but lax on the eastern and southern routes. Now that Fujian Province has been pacified, Chairman Jiang has specially established the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression Army to encircle the bandits. His trip to Guangdong was to obey Chairman Jiang's order to discuss bandit suppression strategies with Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang and to strengthen the bandit suppression military affairs on the eastern and southern routes, as well as the liaison in the southeast. He would stay in Guangdong for three to five days and then return to Xiamen to supervise bandit suppression military affairs. The headquarters of the Eastern Route will be set up in Xiamen, and in the future, depending on the military advancement at the front, it may be moved to Zhangzhou or Longyan, etc. Jiang Dingwen originally planned to transfer four planes from Nanchang to fly to Guangdong, but due to continuous rain, the planes did not arrive.

<p>Guarantees Personal Freedom and Promises Maintenance of Living Expenses</p>
<p>Men Bingyue and Li Ming Will Accompany Fu to Handle Everything</p>
<p>Jin Military Expenditure Agreed; Fu Zuoyi Returns to Sui Today</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi, because the military expenditure has been agreed, is scheduled to return to Sui at noon on the 28th. Li Ming, director of the General Staff Headquarters, because he received a telegram from Sun welcoming him and urging him to go early, went to Baotou a few days ago and transferred to the front to meet Sun. Fu Zhankui is scheduled to go to Baotou on the 1st or 2nd with a lower-level staff member of the branch office to transfer to Dengkou to meet Sun, and will accompany him to leave the army. Whether he will go to Taiyuan or Beiping Tianjin is not yet certain. Hu Jiesan agreed to Fu's appointment and decided to travel with him. Everyone expected that Fu's trip would be very effective because of his excellent personal relationship. The aftermath of Sun's troops will be downsized according to the order issued by He, and one or two senior officials will be sent to handle everything. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Yukun said, "The issues of Yu and Pang Yiji concern the problems of Sun's troops, which are of great importance. Victory is not discussed, but defeat will have a great impact. For the sake of the Northwest, we should quickly seek a solution. I visited He a few days ago, especially to express this intention. He was also deeply concerned about the future troubles in the local area, and expressed sympathy for our advice. We agreed to send Fu Zhankui to go, and appointed Men Bingyue and Li Ming, two senior staff members of the military branch, to accompany Fu to handle everything. Li has already gone to Dengkou first, and Men decided to travel with Fu. They may depart on the 28th or the 1st. A proper solution for Sun's subordinates is being prepared. Sun's residence is scheduled for Beiping Tianjin Chajin. He hopes that Sun will reside in Beiping. Even if he does not come to Beiping Tianjin, his living expenses will be maintained. After Fu leaves, we will jointly telegram Sun to explain the process of the negotiations here. The telegram draft has been drafted by Pang, and will be sent as soon as Fu and others depart. Whether Sun leaves the army depends on the results of Fu and others' trip. The meeting place is scheduled in Dengkou." (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhankui said, "Pang and Yiji telegraphed Sun to persuade him to withdraw in order to calm things down, and have received a reply. Regarding Sun's request to send personnel, they visited He to discuss it repeatedly, and nominated me. He summoned me yesterday to ask for my opinion. I am obligated to serve for both public and private reasons, and I am willing to serve. I also talked briefly about the aftermath of Sun. Sun's troops will be handled according to He's order. Pang and others are willing to jointly maintain Sun's life with personal relationships. Sun's life safety and freedom of residence can be guaranteed by character. Sun himself seems to be in Dengkou. Pang and others intend to telegram him to stop military action. When Ning Fang waits for me to report the results of the meeting with Sun at the front, He can also telegram Ma to stop chasing. It is difficult to predict the results of my trip, but judging from personal feelings, it may be effective. There is only small contact in Ningxia, and there is no major war." (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Yukun said, "Sun's promise to leave the army may not be broken. Whether Sun's subordinates, who have followed Sun for many years, can allow Sun to leave and obey the division into three provinces for downsizing is a problem. Therefore, He has added Li Ming and Men Bingyue to assist and discuss sincerely with Sun's subordinates to resolve the issue smoothly." (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua telegram, Wang Jingguo is still in Baotou, waiting to meet Fu before advancing west. After the Jin army passes the San Shenggong Temple, it has been decided to take the Huangyang Mutou area first. Sun's army is currently deploying defenses in Dengkou to resist the westward advance of the Jin army. Sun's army previously purchased grain and forage in Baotou, owing grain merchants 100,000 yuan. The Baotou Chamber of Commerce is currently unable to recover the money, and sent a telegram to the Sui provincial government on the 27th to request assistance in compensation. Fu visited He this morning to discuss the military expenditure of the Jin and Sui armies, which has been agreed and will be allocated successively. Fu is scheduled to return to Sui at 4 PM on the afternoon of the 28th. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhankui helped Sun to be appointed as the commander of the army and to increase military expenditure during Zhang Xueliang's time, so Pang and others requested Fu to come out to persuade him in order to prevent the expansion of the Northwest war, which is detrimental to the country and the region.

<h3 id="e15">Jiang Telegraphed President Wang, Detailing the Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression; Rumors That Er Wu and Rui Have Been Lost Are Untrue Er <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain foreign news agency recently rumored that the Red bandits were planning to attack the vicinity of Jiujiang. President Wang telegraphed Chairman Jiang on the 24th to inquire about the facts. Yesterday, he received a reply telegram from Chairman Jiang, detailing the recent situation of the remaining bandits and the true situation of the suppression. President Wang reported this at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th. The original telegram is copied below: Urgent Nanjing President Wang Respectful Views, Respectful Telegram is Understood, A part of the Red bandits has recently fled to the vicinity of the Nanxun Road area, but the reason for this northward flight is purely because the two old nests of Xiaoyuan and Yongxin, which the bandits have occupied for many years in western Jiangxi, have been destroyed by our army. The remnants of the bandits have nowhere to stay, so they fled north in desperation. This is a result of being forced, and their power is weak and absolutely nothing to worry about. This is very different from the situation in Nanchang when the Red bandits took the opportunity to charge north during the war of resistance in North China last year. The true situation of the suppression is reported as follows: The false 16th Division, Gao Yongsheng's bandit troops on the Tongwan border in western Jiangxi, and the false 17th Division, Xiao Ke's bandit troops near Yongxin, were severely damaged after being suppressed by our army. They fled everywhere. After being pursued by our various divisions, the two groups of bandits met in Ganfang, west of Fengxin, on the 2nd of this month. After being severely attacked by various divisions, they fled north step by step to the territory of Wuning Ruichang. The various divisions in western Jiangxi pursued from the southwest, and the various departments in southern Hubei also divided and encircled from the northwest and northeast. The troops along the Nanxun Railway strictly guarded and blocked them. The two groups of bandits were exhausted and unable to perform tricks, so they urgently tried to escape. On the 19th of this month, they fled to Henggang, northeast of Wuning, and then split up. Xiao Bandit secretly crossed Xiushui to the south on the night of the 21st and is now in the Miaotai and Jiaokeng area north of Qing'an, and seems to want to flee back to the old nest in Yongxin. Teams have recently been sent to pursue and intercept them. Gao Bandit was defeated, and the remnants of the bandits are scattered in the territory of Wuning Ruining Ruichang and are still being searched. The old nests of the two bandits in Yongxin Xiaoyuan have already been destroyed and cannot be returned. They will be wiped out one after another in the shortest period of time. The so-called loss of Wu Rui Shahe mentioned by the telegram agency is untrue. Furthermore, the defenses of Nanxun Road and Jiujiang are tight, and there will definitely be no mistakes.

<h3 id="e19">Regarding Claims of Armed Conflict on the German-Austrian Border: Be Cautious <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>There are rumors of armed conflict on the German-Austrian border.  The Salzburg Province authorities in Austria have taken responsibility for denying these claims.  However, a war-like atmosphere pervades Germany. On the one hand, there's an ardent veneration for the military prowess of pre-war Germany. On the other hand, there's the flaunting of steel helmets to glorify Hitler's current achievements. The Soviet Union, standing at the opposite extreme, expresses strong disgust. Even Italy, which sympathizes with Germany, will gradually align with France and England, jointly supporting Austria's independence.  It is even expressed informally that, if absolutely necessary, they would not hesitate to use force to aid Austria.  Therefore, the urgency of the European situation places it once again on the eve of war.</p>
<p>For over fifteen years, the German people have been bound by the Treaty of Versailles. Although reparations have been reduced and the treaty has been partially revised, the inequality in armaments, the control of the Saar region, and the close surveillance by surrounding small nations have wounded and saddened patriotic Germans.  They are determined to revitalize their military strength to break the current status quo.  In other words, they have never forgotten their desire to abolish the Treaty of Versailles and achieve freedom and equality in armaments. However, they are hindered by France and face small allied nations as France's satellites. They know it's impossible to seek a satisfactory resolution through legal means at the League of Nations.  Thus, they have no choice but to appeal to the nation and aggressively pursue increased armaments on their own initiative. However, Germany feels restricted by France and Belgium on its western border, and Poland is also quite strong on its eastern border. Even Czechoslovakia should not be underestimated. Only Austria, with the same ethnicity as Germany, has the potential to merge with Germany both economically and geographically. Therefore, the National Socialist Party seeks to gain a foothold in Austria, hoping that Austria, under Hitler's control, will form a Central European economic alliance to jointly resist the countries of the Versailles system.</p>
<p>If this succeeds, France would feel greatly threatened, and Italy would inevitably suffer direct adverse effects. Italy wants to compete with France on both sides of the Mediterranean and in Central Europe. Therefore, it once helped Germany break free from the shackles of the Versailles system. Its opposition to France is almost the opposite of Germany's. Italy wants to hold the reins of Central Europe and lead a Central European economic alliance, so why would it want Germany to be particularly strong? Therefore, after Germany reached out to Austria, Italy immediately joined forces with England and France to jointly declare the preservation of Austria's independence. France is actively uniting the Little Entente to bring all European continental countries under its leadership to support its so-called security guarantees. Even the Soviet Union, which has always been in opposition to France, has established friendly relations. In other words, it is expressing a tendency for its relationship with Germany to worsen. England has always been very cautious about the European situation. Whether helping Germany or France, it always adheres to the spirit of its traditional diplomacy. Now, with Germany's aggressive actions towards Austria, while still expressing its intention to maintain the status quo and continuing to advocate its old tune of arms reduction, it also wants to help France and Italy to limit Germany in practice.</p>
<p>Regarding Austria's recent situation, its population is concentrated in cities, and its birth rate is insufficient to sustain itself. The only way to survive with difficulty is to be close to Germany, which can overcome the current difficulties and alleviate the suffering of living by borrowing money. Even in terms of the nation's language, customs, and historical traditions, there is the possibility of merging with Germany. However, the excessive impetuosity of Hitler's followers has also stirred up Austrian animosity. Therefore, judging from the current situation, Germany is already in a state of diplomatic isolation.</p>
<p>Will Germany, in this situation, truly rouse its national fervor and use force as a last resort? If Hitler does so, it may not be a blessing for Germany's future. Modern warfare is not determined by a momentary surge of courage. Temporary victories are not to be relied upon. Victory on the battlefield requires abundant resources, advanced scientific technology, and a strong and powerful economic organization. Today, Germany's science and technology can be said to be quite sophisticated. The nation's passion for resistance has also reached its peak. But what about the lack of natural resources? What about the fragility of its economic structure? If a war unfortunately breaks out, the calamity of a blockade will be inevitable. Germans, who have struggled for so long, should also know the danger of their situation and dare not blindly rush forward. Based on this, even though the clouds over Central Europe are extremely dark, a bloody tragedy may not break out immediately.</p>

<p>To Study the Silver Agreement and Silver Price Issues</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Expresses His Views</p>
<p>The Silver Agreement is Likely to be Approved</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council convened a review meeting at 4:00 PM on the 27th, inviting relevant ministers, including Kong Xiangxi, Chen Gongbo, Tang Youren, Chu Minyi, Wang Luyi, Chen Lifu, and Ye Chucang, to study the Silver Agreement and the response to the US raising the price of silver on the 24th. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM in order to submit the discussion to the Central Political Council the next day. The Central Propaganda Department is scheduled to host a press conference on the 28th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang told reporters that the US implementation of the silver policy has a very close impact on China's economy and financial future. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th has not yet submitted it for discussion. An emergency meeting will be convened in the afternoon to host the relevant agencies to study response measures. The Central Political Conference is expected to reach a decision on the 28th. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Although our country had no reservations at the time of the International Silver Agreement, it did not hold ratification procedures. It is not yet possible to determine whether the recent increase in the price of silver by the United States has any impact on us. We and India are non-silver producing countries, but silver-using countries. If the increase is too large, our country's financial market to national uneasiness. Therefore, the government is reviewing this issue this afternoon and believes that it is necessary to approve the Silver Agreement so that it will have more room to speak in the future. As for the current international silver price issue, it will not express its views for the time being and will wait and see the situation. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi told reporters on the 27th that the Central Political Council Review Committee meticulously discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the silver issue to our country, and concrete results have been obtained. The discussion will be submitted to the Central Political Council on the 28th, and a concrete decision can be obtained. Kong then expressed his personal opinions, saying that the silver problem is extremely complicated. Experts from all countries have exhausted their efforts and repeatedly pondered it, but in the end, the advantages and disadvantages are mutually visible. Last year's World Economic Conference believed that if we want to save the economic panic, it is necessary to prosper international trade, and we must first seek the stability of international exchange rates. Therefore, the main silver producing countries and silver using countries signed a silver agreement to prevent the massive dumping of silver on the international market. I am a silver using country, not a silver producing country. Article 4 of the Agreement only stipulates that China shall not dump silver converted from waste coins into the market, and there are no other restrictions. Recently, some people have asked the government not to approve the agreement. In fact, the key to the influence of the Agreement on the international silver market does not lie in whether or not I approve it, but in how my response strategy is determined. The US increase in the price of silver is intended to complete the recovery movement and increase international trade. This move is different from my point of view of interests. My annual trade deficit is tens of millions of yuan. If the price of silver increases, the outflow can be reduced, and when the price of silver is high, the price of goods will be low, and my imports will benefit from it. As for the impact on exports after the price of silver is high, foreign goods will enter the country smoothly, and the industry and commerce will be unsustainable. However, currency is only an exchange medium, and the sales of goods are determined by the strength of purchasing power. After the European War, the price of silver was extremely high, and at that time my goods were still selling well in various countries. In recent years, the world economy has been sluggish and the price of silver has been low, but my goods have been unsalable, which is clear evidence. My response to this matter should be based on international conditions. The government has already matured planning, and rumors of prohibiting silver exports and collecting export taxes are only one aspect. However, stabilizing the price of currency is not an easy principle. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang talked on the morning of the 27th about whether or not to approve the Silver Agreement. The Central Political Council had already discussed it last week. The Central Political Council can make a concrete decision on the morning of the 28th. The matter of the US increasing the price of silver will also be discussed together.

<p>If Japan Uses Violence to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is Prepared to Resist Firmly</p>
<p>(Moscow) The official Soviet newspaper warned Japan today that negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway must be conducted on a sincere and realistic basis, because the Soviet Union does not want to be a passive bystander and be fooled. The Soviet Union will make every effort to resist any attempt to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. The News, a newspaper of the Soviet government agency, carried an editorial today saying that Japan's internal and external situation, as well as the determination of Soviet foreign policy, can make Japan understand that it cannot use violent means against countries such as the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union now believes that if Japan respects the borders of Russia and does not infringe on Russian interests, all difficult problems between Russia and Japan can be solved. The Communist Party's organ, Zhenli Bao, also held the same view, warning Japan that personnel handling negotiations in Tokyo, Harbin, and Changchun must not forget that attempts to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway or interfere with the railway's operations will be resolutely resisted by the Soviet Union.

<p>Outstanding Issues Can Be Resolved Through Peaceful Means</p>
<p>Conflicts Over the Eastern Railway Will Not Lead to War</p>
<p>The US Will Likely Remain Outside of Any Potential Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p>Observations of Renowned New York Reporter Brisbane</p>
<p>Vienna – The Japanese Minister to Vienna and Hungary, Matsunaga, in an interview with an Assest report reporter, stated that Japan has absolutely no reason to wage war with Russia. He said, "Only when issues concerning the vital interests of both countries arise can war break out. However, there is no such case between Japan and Russia. I do not understand why those in responsible positions in Soviet Russia suddenly talk of conflict. Japanese political figures and major newspapers are doing their utmost to prevent provocative propaganda. Indeed, there are unresolved economic and political issues between the two countries, but there is no need to resolve them through war. As for the issue of the Middle Eastern Railway, it will definitely not become a cause for war. Soviet Russia proposed selling it to 'Manchukuo.' Japan is mediating between the two parties to allow negotiations to succeed. Even if the sale fails, the Middle Eastern Railway will still be owned by the Russians, and this will not lead to war," and so on. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>New York – Renowned American journalist Brisbane commented on the recent rumors of a Russo-Japanese war, stating, "The US government believes that a Russo-Japanese war will be difficult to avoid in the near future. But no matter what situation arises, the United States must always remain outside of the conflict. Japanese intellectuals will strive to prevent this war from happening. If war breaks out between the two countries, Russia will suffer a major blow, but will not be completely conquered by Japan. Russia has twice the population of Japan, ten times the resources, and possesses ample strength. Moreover, the iron-fisted dictator Stalin is not one to sign treaties that are not based on victory."

<p>(Washington) – During a session of the House of Representatives, Republican Representative McFadden from Pennsylvania delivered a speech criticizing Britain, stating that it intentionally incites conflict between the United States and Japan in order to reap the benefits, as both the US and Japan are Britain's strong competitors in the world market. McFadden proposed that France cede Martinique Island in the Antilles Islands of the Americas to the United States to repay war debts. The United States should also negotiate with the British and Australian governments to cede the Admiralty Islands and the Solomon Islands (all in the Atlantic Antilles Islands) to the United States for the purpose of protecting American Far Eastern commerce. He argued that this measure is absolutely necessary. McFadden also stated that several years ago, when British Prime Minister MacDonald came to the United States to meet with President Hoover, he proposed ceding Bermuda Island in the Atlantic to repay war debts, but Hoover rejected it for unknown reasons. He now requests that this matter be investigated, and so on. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>

The Army Ministry had long intended to make changes. Due to differing opinions between the ministry and the Kwantung Army on the South Manchurian Railway issue, Army Minister Araki has resigned, and Lieutenant General Koiso also had to be replaced.

<p>Saitō Responds in Secret Meeting</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – Today's general meeting of the House of Peers' budget committee opened at 10:17 AM. First, Baron Ōkura Kōbō raised questions regarding the Manchurian issue:</p>
<p>(1) Which government department is primarily responsible for handling the Manchurian issue?</p>
<p>(2) In reviewing the policy towards Manchuria, is it necessary to establish a new national policy?</p>
<p>(3) Should a clear treaty be established between Japan and Manchukuo?</p>
<p>(4) Should any decisions made between Japan and Manchukuo be implemented within the scope of the treaty?</p>
<p>(5) Should "Manchukuo" be fully supported in the future?</p>
<p>A clear response should be provided for the above five items. Yesterday, the Prime Minister, in response to Baron Iwakura's questions, stated that it is better to complete the existing organization than to establish a new agency in Manchuria. However, today, we do not know where to discuss the Manchurian issue. Should Minister Kakumu primarily address the economic and industrial issues? I believe that first-rate personnel should be dispatched to Manchuria to develop industry and the economy. What does the Prime Minister think? I further feel that it is necessary to establish a joint government-civilian committee on the Manchurian issue.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saitō replied:</p>
<p>"Manchukuo" has recently become an "Empire," so its regulations and other aspects should be reformed. The Special Affairs Department is a transitional organization. Its role in maintaining security and other situations will gradually change in the future.</p>
<p>Baron Ōkura added:</p>
<p>I am not satisfied with the Prime Minister's response.</p>
<p>Regarding the policy towards Manchuria, the baron requested a temporary secret meeting. This secret meeting was held from 10:56 AM to 11:50 AM. Afterwards,</p>
<p>Baron Ōkura asked:</p>
<p>Efforts should be made to fully assist Manchuria, but I wonder if there are genuine friendship policies to be introduced in the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo. Are there any ideas for immigration to Manchuria? What plans are in place for developing industry?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saitō replied:</p>
<p>We have policies to introduce friendship with all countries in the world. As for Manchuria, it goes without saying. We plan to devise appropriate measures for immigration to Manchuria in the future. As for developing industry, we are currently considering it.</p>
<p>At noon, a recess was announced. (United News Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>France's Attitude Still Doubtful</p>
<p>Eden Returns to London for a Short Stay in Paris</p>
<p>(London) – British Lord Privy Seal Eden's tour of Europe has yielded satisfactory results. This afternoon, Eden paid a visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and spoke for an hour and a half. Afterwards, a communiqué was issued stating that Eden had presented to the Italian Prime Minister the details of his talks in Paris and Berlin, so that he could reconsider the British-Italian memorandum. They agreed on various points, especially on finding a basis for a general agreement. Eden told the British press corps that he now has better hopes for reaching a general agreement than when he set out. If the Berlin and Rome statements included related items that were to be received by the British plan as a basis for negotiation, then they would also be willing to accept it. Only France's attitude is still doubtful, but Premier Doumergue promised to clearly inform the French government's attitude when he visits Paris again. The Italian Prime Minister is eager to reach an agreement and is less pessimistic than the Italian newspapers. However, he believes that the Italian plan offers more opportunities than the British plan. Eden is scheduled to depart for London tomorrow, with a short stopover in Paris, to continue discussions with the French Prime Minister and others. Eden had an audience with the Pope this morning. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome – It is rumored that the points agreed upon by Eden and Mussolini are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Countries with stronger military forces will temporarily maintain the status quo. (2) International community to collectively abandon chemical warfare. (3) The international community will find a way for Germany to prove its sincerity, in other words, Germany will implement partial rearmament of defensive forces under effective monitoring. (4) A separate special agreement will be formulated for military groups outside of formal armies.</p>
<p>The possibility of the last point seems to be due to Eden's recent visit to Germany. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome – This afternoon, British Lord Privy Seal Eden and Prime Minister Mussolini held talks for about two hours. In terms of negotiations on a general disarmament agreement, there has been significant progress. Currently, what both parties are seeking is a compromise between the British and Italian positions. The so-called compromise seems closer to the Italian view and further from the British plan. It is rumored that some proposals have been drafted during today's talks, which can be considered by the French government. Although the number of these proposals is limited, they are all clear and concrete. Eden originally planned to depart from Rome for France on Wednesday, but now plans to advance the departure date and go to Paris tomorrow. Eden is eager to meet with French authorities because the Rome talks have yielded the aforementioned results. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Austrian Authorities Express Hope for Calm</p>
<p>But Troops Continue to Move Towards the Border</p>
<p>Austrian Socialist Party's Ultimatum to the Government Expires Today</p>
<p>Vienna – The situation in Austria is extremely chaotic, causing anxiety throughout Europe. News from various provinces indicates that troops are continuing to move. However, according to an explanation from official circles today, only a few internal security corps and auxiliary troops have been transferred to new locations in Upper Austria to maintain order. It is also said that the troop movements near the borders of neighboring countries are only for precautionary purposes, and there is no need to worry unless there is an attempt to change borders by force. According to the leader of the Internal Security Corps, Starhemberg, the fundamental principles of the new Austrian constitution will be similar to those of the Italian Fascist constitution, with a transitional period of fifteen years. Since Austria, Italy, and Hungary have turned away from democracy, the friendship between the three countries can be even stronger. Practical forms of cooperation are now secondary issues. If the rejection of democracy fails, then National Socialism will inevitably seize the opportunity to invade. The reason why the Austrian Fascists and Hitler cannot approach each other is because the Austrian Fascists are determined to maintain Austrian independence and advocate for Christian Austria, while rejecting utopian racial ideals. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome – There has been no news here of Italian military actions on the Austrian border, but the garrison troops are all on alert. At the same time, according to those who participated in the German winter sports and returned to Innsbruck today, they received a subtle hint to leave Italy quickly when they arrived in South Tyrol. People here are now speculating that Germany may close its border with Italy and Austria. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Vienna – The Prime Minister's office issued a statement today, which proves that the situation on the Austrian-German border is gradually showing signs of hope. The statement said that Dollfuss has not reinforced troops along the border, and the border is currently quite peaceful. It also stated that there will be no disturbances when the so-called Austrian National Socialist Party inspector Habicht's ultimatum expires on Wednesday. Habicht had threatened that if Dollfuss did not agree to cooperate with the Austrian Socialist Party, he would intensify his hostile activities against Dollfuss and the Austrian government. Today, it is rumored that 40,000 Austrian Internal Security Corps members (Fascist Party members) have arrived at the border to take on patrol duties. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Vienna – Peace between Austria and Germany, according to reliable sources here today, will be established before or in early March. It is rumored that negotiations began at the end of this week when Prince Starhemberg, Minister of Public Security, and a close official of Hitler met. The purpose of the meeting was to agree on a policy to stop the hostility between the fascist organizations of both sides and restore their traditional friendship. Although the "truce period" given to Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss by Austrian National Socialist Party supervisor Habicht will expire this Wednesday, it is deeply believed here that Hitler will not allow any further provocations while the current peace talks are in progress. Habicht had previously requested that Alphons consider the National Socialist Party's demand for his resignation and promote German-Austrian cooperation before February 28. During this period, the National Socialist Party will not take any hostile actions against the Austrian government. At the same time, Austria is concentrating its troops on the Austrian-German border, because it is rumored that 10,000 National Socialists have already gathered there, plotting to invade Vienna.

<p>Vienna – Starhemberg attended a restoration party meeting today, which is a preview of the eventual restoration of the Habsburg dynasty. Starhemberg is the leader of the Austrian Internal Security Corps or Fascists. When he arrived at the meeting, there was a loud cheer, which lasted for several minutes before it subsided. Speakers demanded the repeal of the decree prohibiting the Habsburg royal family from entering the country, saying that this is the first step towards restoration, but there is no need for restoration at present.

<p>(London) – The third meeting of the British-Japanese private consultation can be held on the 28th. The British representatives here attended the special committee on measures against Japanese goods competition convened in Manchester on the afternoon of the 26th. After serious discussion on the attitude of the United Kingdom, the committee's attitude remained strong. The so-called market scope problem still follows the previous claim of the British side and will not be compromised. Future agreements with the Japanese side must apply to the world market and must not be limited to the colonies directly under British jurisdiction, as advocated by the Japanese side. The British representatives intend to maintain their position. Viewing this situation, the breakdown of the British-Japanese consultation is already an unavoidable fact, and its future is extremely worrying. (United News Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Recommends Using Current Tariffs as Starting Point</p>
<p>Seeking General Principles of Resolution</p>
<p>(London) – The British government today replied to the French government's note on starting trade agreement negotiations between the two countries. Although the content of the reply has not been published, it is understood that the British government proposed that the current tariffs applied by the two countries be temporarily maintained as they are, and that negotiations should use this as a starting point. At the same time, it is suggested that the negotiations should resolve general principles, and not be limited to certain special goods. It is rumored that the two governments, apart from minor issues, have agreed on the basis for starting trade negotiations. However, it is understood that negotiations cannot begin within two or three weeks. France recently restricted the amount of British goods imported, which triggered a trade war between Britain and France. The UK then levied a 20% surtax on certain imported French goods, which significantly affected France, which proposed a reconciliation method, one of which was to start new trade agreement negotiations. The above British reply is a response to this proposal. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Criticism from the London Financial News</p>
<p>(London) – The Financial News commented today on the Shanghai Banking Association's protest against President Roosevelt's move to increase world silver prices, stating that what China needs is a better government, lower taxes, higher export prices, and a more effective transportation system. If China gets what it needs, then the price of silver will not affect China. Those who want to expand China's export trade find that the difficulty lies in raising the prices of soybeans, silk, eggs, peanuts, tea, leather, and coal, and not in raising the price of currency. But if various silver plans can make silver prices a little more stable, then of course it will not be without benefit to China. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) – Soviet Russia is currently organizing a Ministry of Internal Affairs, like the British Home Office, which will manage the political detective teams and the affairs currently handled by the People's Militia. Most of the political detective teams will be disbanded. Today, according to well-informed sources, the authorities feel that they have won the worst war to eliminate internal enemies, so they think it is appropriate to establish this new Ministry of Internal Affairs. However, the elimination of hostile elements will still not be relaxed in the future. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>He Usually Served in the Russian Political Detective Squad</p>
<p>Died in the Bathroom Before Returning Home</p>
<p>Assassination or Suicide?</p>
<p>(Istanbul) Mitching, the 35-year-old Second Secretary of the Soviet Russian Embassy in Ankara, suddenly died in the bathroom of the Russian Consulate here, shocking diplomatic and political circles. Mitching was scheduled to board the Russian ship Chichirin in half an hour to go to Odessa, and his luggage had already been sent aboard. Mitching served in the Soviet Russian political detective squad in Ankara, and last week received an order from the squad to return home. Some say that Mitching was afraid of returning home and committed suicide. If so, he must have made this decision at the last minute, as his luggage had already been sent to the dock. Others say that Mitching was assassinated for refusing to return home. Turkish police are inclined to believe the latter, as the examination of Mitching's remains does not seem to indicate suicide. It is said that Soviet Russian officials who are suddenly recalled to their country often commit suicide or die mysteriously. The death of Mitching will also become a mystery. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<p>Heavy Guard Around Parliament</p>
<p>To Prevent Demonstrators from Causing Disturbances</p>
<p>(London) More than two hundred hunger marchers marched in a group to Downing Street, arriving there at 1:30 PM. They then sent sixteen representatives to the Prime Minister's residence to request an audience with the Prime Minister. At that time, MacDonald was not there, and the representatives waited at the residence. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, representatives of the "Hunger March" plan to protest the government's unemployment bill to the House of Commons. The police have made all preparations for prevention. According to precedent, no demonstrations are allowed within forty miles of Parliament when it is in session. The police will now do everything possible to maintain this rule. In November 1932, a demonstration occurred, and it took the police three hours to drive the demonstrators outside the prohibited area. This time, the police are confident that they can maintain order more effectively than in previous years. Labor Member of Parliament, Mr. McGovern, who is known for his ardent advocacy for the unemployed, has also submitted a petition requesting the government to allow the delegation to enter the House of Commons. The government has not yet indicated its consent. If the government refuses, and the hunger marchers who have traveled a long distance are determined to achieve their goal, their appearance in London may inevitably lead to disturbances. Yesterday, two hunger marchers were charged with insulting and assaulting the police. Both pleaded not guilty, but the criminal court ordered them to be released on bail for a continued hearing in one week. (Reuter, 27th)</p>

<p>The Current Cabinet's Difficult Situation</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the turmoil in Japanese politics has a historical background. This historical background is particularly serious in Japan, namely, the international crisis publicized by the general public, the crisis of 1936, the rumors of a war between Japan and the United States, the rumors of an inevitable war between Japan and the Soviet Union, and recently the added deterioration of relations between Japan and the United Kingdom. The Japanese General Staff is naturally particularly busy, and the Army and Navy are also preparing and rapidly expanding their military equipment. The more urgent the expansion of military equipment, the more intense the atmosphere of social unrest.</p>
<p>Originally, the Saito Cabinet was a so-called "national unity cabinet" during a period of emergency. Once the emergency period was over, things should have returned to normal. In fact, the so-called emergency period, from the perspective of Japan's actual situation, was mostly internal. As such, the Saito Cabinet should have resigned long ago because of its own unsoundness. However, it unexpectedly lasted until now. The Navy Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, and Minister of Commerce and Industry have been replaced, and now the Minister of Education, who comes from the Seiyukai, is also involved. In the past, Okada, Uchida, and Araki all resigned on the grounds that their ill health could not withstand the pressure of work. Only Nakajima Kumakichi was questioned by the House of Peers about the "Ashikaga Takauji Theory," which harmed the Japanese national essence, and was forced to resign. In fact, the resignations of the past ministers all contained serious contradictions in Japan's domestic and foreign affairs. The so-called "illness" was indeed a pretext. From this method of filling cabinet vacancies, one can know the characteristics of the emergency cabinet, and also glimpse a part of the recent changes in Japanese politics.</p>
<p>Whether the Saito Cabinet will collapse after this depends on the strength of the overthrow movement, and at the same time, it depends on how they use their political skills. According to the past situation, it was not as if people did not express dissatisfaction with the Saito Cabinet, and it was not as if they did not consider the Saito Cabinet to be too weak and powerless. However, they were unable to overthrow it. The strong cabinet that the military expected was difficult to produce, and a party cabinet could not be brewed. The reason for this is that the military is not very unified internally. The Navy and the Army have different political views, and within the Army, the Araki, Masaki, and Ugaki factions stand in a three-legged balance of power, unwilling to yield to each other. Therefore, the Hiranuma Cabinet has become a thing of the past, and I am afraid it will never be realized again. Secondly, the representatives of the elder statesmen, such as Prince Saionji, quite disapprove of the military's actions and are unwilling to lightly allow the military to form a cabinet. A party cabinet cannot happen because the credibility of the parties has been lost and cannot be restored in an instant. This time, the bribery case of Minister of Education Hatoyama, as exposed by Okamoto, although the facts may not necessarily be correct, has greatly damaged the parties. It is almost impossible to restore constitutional order.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current internal situation of the Seiyukai is similar to that of the Kiyoura Cabinet era. The opposition between Tokonami, Kuhara, and the executive faction is extremely sharp. Because of the issue of the violation of party discipline by Mr. Tsugumo Kunitoshi and Mr. Nishiho Riba, the internal conflicts of the Seiyukai have been caused by the issue of expulsion. Tokonami Takejiro's opposition and Mochizuki Keisuke's cautious remarks have put the current executives in a dilemma. Since problems have occurred in the party's control, they have involved the entire parliamentary politics.</p>
<p>Hatoyama Ichiro and Mitsushi Chuzo are both current cabinet members from the Seiyukai, and they are all key figures involved in the issue of discipline. What the truth is is another matter. This alone can agitate the feelings of the general public, expose the stains and weaknesses of the current government, and the military can take advantage of it to create a military fascist politics. Kuhara's faction, since it is at odds with the executive faction of the Seiyukai, will use any means to overthrow the current cabinet. They secretly collude with the Kokumin Domei, unite dissidents, and concentrate their efforts to attack the weaknesses of the current government. At the same time, they also plan to contact Tokonami's faction to oppose the executive faction. Their steps are: first, return the expulsion order; second, impeach the impropriety of the executives expelling members of parliament from the party; and third, propose a motion of no confidence in the president. Of course, during this period, there will be movements in various localities and in the parliament to support the current executives. Under the opposition of the two sides, the ugly appearance of the parties will naturally be exposed even more severely. The military will increasingly use this dispute to carry out the overthrow of the cabinet. However, the practicality of the military's monopolization of politics in the future is still immature. The form of parliament can still be extended for a certain period of time. (Tokyo, February 23)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Post-War Problems in Southern Fujian <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Seven Route Soldiers Disarmed and Transferred North</p>
<p>Civil Army Commanders Ordered to Be Abolished</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, The military situation in Fujian Province, since the reorganization of the 19th Route Army into the 7th Route Army, has been completely stabilized after the entire force was transferred north to Henan for training. When the 19th Route Army gathered in Hui'an, Putian, and Xianyou, there were still nearly 30,000 people. Among them, some wanted to break through the encirclement and go to Longyan to gather and form an army. However, the Central Army's defenses were very tight. Except for the 61st Division's Shi Baoqi Regiment, about 600 people who escaped from Tuling in Hui'an to Jiudu in Nan'an and were recruited by the civil army Chen Yucai, the rest were unable to break through or were intercepted. As a result of discussions between Wei Lihuang and Mao Weishou, the 60th, 61st, 78th, and 49th divisions were disarmed before being transferred north and then departed. As a result, the 60th, 78th, and 49th divisions in Putian and Xianyou were disarmed by the 36th Division in Hanjiang, Putian, in early February and transported north by ship. The armaments were handed over to the 36th Division for safekeeping and transported to Beijing by another ship. The 61st Division was finally disarmed by the 10th Division in Hui'an on the 12th and transported to Beijing from Tuling and the 7th Route Army headquarters on the 20th. After the soldiers of the four divisions were disarmed, they were reassembled under the supervision of the Central Army. The newly appointed division commander gave a speech, saying that disarming was not surrendering and that the meaning was absolutely different. Because the current position and environment of each division were very bad, the soldiers were colluding with outsiders to sell firearms privately or fleeing in groups, which would be tantamount to trapping the soldiers in crime. Therefore, at this time, the arms were temporarily confiscated and the order to depart was followed. After arriving at the training location designated by the Military Commission in the north, the firearms would still be returned to the soldiers. The Central Government had absolutely no discrimination against the 7th Route Army, and in the future, it would definitely be treated the same as the Central Army, etc. Mao Weishou came to Xiamen from Quanzhou on the 16th. He originally intended to ask for six months' leave, to be acted upon by Zhao Jinwen, the Chief of Staff of the 7th Route Army. However, Chairman Chiang sent repeated telegrams urging Mao to go to Ganzhou and commended him for his proper handling this time, and did not allow him to ask for leave. Mao flew from Xiamen to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Guangdong plane on the 22nd and transferred to Ganzhou to meet Chiang.</p>
<p>On the Longyan front, the entire Huang Renhuan Division of the Guangdong Army left Longyan on the 18th and withdrew to Shanghang and Wuping. On the one hand, Chen Jitang telegraphed Nanchang to ask Chiang to send a team to take over Longyan, and Chen also ordered all troops entering Fujian to withdraw to Guangdong before the 24th. The entry of the Guangdong Army into Fujian came to an end.</p>
<p>After the end of the military operations, the biggest post-war problem was the disposal of the civil army, especially in southern Fujian, which was the most complicated. Chairman Chiang had issued an order to all civil army commanders and military commissioners to abolish them all. The original order stated, "The military operations of this anti-rebellion have come to an end. The anti-rebellion civil army commanders and military commissioners appointed by this headquarters should be immediately abolished. This headquarters has appointed Yang Fengnian as the commander of the southern Fujian anti-rebellion army, Huang Kesheng as the deputy commander, Du Qiyun as the military commissioner, Yu Chengyao as the commander of the anti-rebellion army in Quanzhou and Xinghua, Song Yuanyuan as the special commissioner of Fujian pacification, Zhang Xiongnan as the commander of the anti-rebellion army in Yongde, Xiao Shuxuan as the military commissioner of this headquarters, Fang Shengtan and Lin Zhiyuan as the Fujian military commissioners, Shen Chichang as the commander of the Second Route guerrilla anti-rebellion army, Wang Changqi as the deputy commander, Lin Shouguo as the southern Fujian military commissioner, and Xu Youlin as the commander of the Fujian anti-rebellion civil army, and Luo Weixiong as the deputy commander. It is hoped that these officers will be ordered to comply with the abolition and report. All official seals, etc., should be cut off." Among those listed in the order, in addition to the military commissioners, all the commanders, only Shen Chichang, the commander of the Second Route guerrilla anti-rebellion army, belonged to northern Fujian, and the rest belonged to southern Fujian. In addition, there was also Qin Wangshan, the commander of the Jin-Nan-Hui anti-rebellion army appointed by the northern front headquarters, and the evil Deputy Commander Wang Zhennan. Among the civil armies, the one under Yang Fengnian in southern Fujian was the largest. According to the list he made, there were 30,000 people in Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua. After the Central Government issued an order to end the civil armies, Commander Chiang telegraphed Chen Yi, approving the reorganization of Yang's troops into two regiments of the Security Corps, with Yang as the commander. However, recently, when the troops were reviewed in Zhangzhou, the troops in Zhangzhou alone had reached ten battalions, about 6,000 people. The number will be reduced to six battalions and reorganized into two regiments. However, Zhang Wende, Zhang Xiongnan, and Lin Jing in Quanzhou still have no less than 7,000 or 8,000 people, and there is no way to accommodate them. Zhang Zhen, the former commander of the 49th Division, once went to Quanzhou for this matter and met with Wei Lihuang to discuss the results. It was proposed to ask Chiang to further reduce the number of security teams in Quanzhou by two regiments. Commander Chiang telegraphed Zhang to Nanchang to discuss the matter of the reorganization of the civil army in southern Fujian in person. Zhang plans to fly to Ganzhou after meeting with Chiang Dingwen in Xiamen today (23rd). It is heard that Qin Wangshan's troops will be reorganized into one regiment, with Wang Zhennan as the regiment commander. As for the bad troops, they will all be disbanded. Those who disobey will be treated as bandits. The Wu Ci Department of Du Qiyun's Department is now being suppressed by the Third Division. (February 23)</p>
<h3 id="e101">After the National Army Captured Yongxin <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The People Who Have Been Communist-ized for Seven Years are Returning One After Another</p>
<p>The Headquarters Orders Strict Prevention of Bandits Destroying Bunkers</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, The Headquarters announced that the National Army's advance into Yongxin, occupation of Longyuankou, and recovery of Yongcheng only used a few regiments of troops to fight fiercely against the pseudo 18th Division, pseudo independent regiment, and Red School student team. The bandits resisted stubbornly with danger, and the National Army fought bravely, one falling, another following. It was only possible to kill the enemy and achieve results. Since the occupation of Qixicen Longyuankou on the 5th and the recovery of Xincheng on the 18th, the time was not long, and more than 5,000 people have returned. Yongxin has been communist-ized for seven years, and so many people have returned, which is truly a manifestation of the total collapse of the Jiangxi bandits.</p>
<p>Also, after the Red bandits were strictly blockaded by the National Army, the materials in the bandit area were extremely panicked. The bandits were most panicked by the National Army's construction of bunkers, so they came up with ghostly tricks and specially made a kind of iron-covered vehicle, about two feet high, with iron plates as a cover, under which two or three people could be hidden. They held iron drills, cauldrons, chisels, and other things to rush to the foot of the bunker, and then used iron drills, cauldrons, chisels, and other things to destroy the bunker. After the headquarters reported the investigation by the Special Investigation Office of the Provincial Party Department, it divided the orders to the various armies and the provincial government to quickly install auxiliary defenses in the bunkers everywhere to prevent peeping, and to manufacture anti-strike equipment to bomb and destroy the car. It is learned that after receiving the order, the City Defense Headquarters has specially transferred the order to its subordinate military and police agencies to follow. (February 26)</p>

<h3 id="e103">Zhang Xueliang Arrives in Hankou <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to be Sworn In</p>
<p>And Will Inspect Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression for the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, arrived in Hankou on the 23rd aboard the Yong Sui warship from Nanjing. On the 24th, it passed Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang. On the 25th, he arrived in Hankou at 8:30 AM. Chief of Staff Qian Dajun, Chief Counselor Xia Douyin, Pacification Director He Chengjun, Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Hunan-Hubei Border Region Xu Yuanquan, Garrison Commander Ye Peng, Commander of the Second Naval Fleet Zeng Yiding, and others, leading civil officials of the rank of Jianren and above, and military officers of the rank of Major General and above, welcomed him at the Sanbei Wharf. Amidst tight security by the military and police, Zhang went to the Bank Association's office to meet with military, political, party, provincial, and municipal party committee representatives, and gave a speech, roughly stating, "I have received orders from the Central Government to reluctantly take on the position of Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression for the three provinces. I will do my utmost to wipe out the remaining bandits and stabilize the local areas. The organization of the headquarters will remain the same, with no changes whatsoever, and no additional deputy commander headquarters will be established to save expenses. The date of my inauguration has not yet been set. I intend to begin work first. To understand the bandit situation, I will personally inspect the areas." When Zhang set off, the National Government sent Secretary Gao Lingbai, the Ministry of Navy sent Counselor Ren Guangyu, and Adjutant Zhou Xianzhang. Zhang's entourage included Chief Adjutant Tang Guozhen, Chief Guard Tan Hai, former Director of Foreign Affairs Shen Zutong, Secretary Wu Zhongxian, and Staff Officer He Kui. They sailed on the same ship and stayed at the Deming Hotel, Central Hotel, and Pacific Hotel. Zhang resided at the office. That evening, He Zhuguo, Commander of the 57th Army, and Wei Zonghan, a member of the Pingjin Military Branch, arrived in Hankou from Zhengzhou. Liu Jianxu, Commander of the First Column of the Western Route Army, also came from Hunan. Sun Lianzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 26th Route Army, Shangguan Yunxiang, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army, Pei Changhui, Commander of the 47th Division, and others, who had been waiting in Hankou, successively met with Zhang to ask for instructions. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, after Zhang returned He Chengjun's visit, he immediately accompanied He Zhuguo across the river on the Huasheng small steamer, first going to the Provincial Government to return Zhang Qun's visit and inquire about political measures, and then going to the headquarters to begin work, discussing bandit suppression matters in the three provinces in detail with Chief of Staff Qian Dajun. In the afternoon, he returned to the office across the river. That evening at 7:00 PM, he hosted a banquet for Qian Dajun, He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, He Zhuguo, Wei Zonghan, Sun Lianzhong, Shangguan Yunxiang, and various senior generals, during which they discussed military matters related to bandit suppression. Generals from the three provinces will all set out to Hankou to pay their respects, report on defense, and request instructions. After Zhang begins work, he will temporarily work at the Wuchang headquarters and the Hankou office. The swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for the first day of next month, and telegrams have been sent to the Central Government, the National Government, and the Military Affairs Commission, requesting them to send senior officials to Hubei to supervise the oath. After taking office, he will go to Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang to request instructions. After returning to Hankou from Nanchang, he will go to the bandit areas of the three provinces for inspection. After that, he will be stationed in the Wuchang headquarters to perform the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and preside over the suppression affairs. As for the political situation in the three provinces, it is said that it will not be changed due to Zhang's arrival in Hankou. There is currently no news of the Northeast Army being transferred south. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Chairman Chiang Instructs Anhui Province to Eliminate Long-Standing Problems <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Go Ahead and Act Decisively Based on the Principle of Using Severe Punishments in Times of Chaos.</p>
<p>We Will Vigorously Support You Regardless of Any Difficulties.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, in order to reform local politics, seeks to eliminate all long-standing problems in the province, and recently submitted the province's political situation and improvement measures to Chairman Chiang for review. After reviewing the report, Chiang believed that Anhui Province's long-standing problems had persisted for a long time, and that the matters mentioned in the report were all crucial plans. Yesterday, he specifically issued instructions to follow the points that should be corrected in the report, and ordered the principle of using severe punishments in times of chaos to be used to eliminate corruption and eradicate local bullies. The original text said, "The report has been reviewed. It has been found that Anhui Province's long-standing problems have persisted for a long time, and that the matters mentioned in the report are all crucial plans. Except for water conservancy and mining, which will be handled separately after funds have been raised, the points that should be corrected in the report are listed as follows. The first section of item A of the report states that the problem with Anhui Province's taxes lies entirely in the registration books, embezzlement of public funds, and reliance on large households as protectors, so we have no choice but to protect large households. If we want to clear up taxes, we must first eliminate the registration books and allow the people to submit them to the treasury themselves, so that we can verify the actual situation. In particular, we should thoroughly investigate those who seek tax exemption in the name of ancestral hall public funds and ensure that they are all included in the regular tax. Otherwise, I am afraid that it will still not be easy to thoroughly rectify the situation. Also, the first section of item B states that Anhui Province's gentry factions are complex, and county magistrates are indecisive, hoping to protect their positions, so that county administration cannot proceed. What you have stated has hit the nail on the head, but the biggest reason why county magistrates do not dare to deal with the situation strictly is that they are afraid of the local bullies inciting unrest. Once local unrest occurs, regardless of right or wrong, if the county magistrate does not handle it well, he will have no excuse. If the provincial authorities do not understand the truth, not only will their positions be questioned, but they will also inevitably suffer future troubles, so they all shirk their responsibilities and live in peace. This matter cannot be blamed solely on the county magistrates. The provincial authorities should carefully select candidates, first have deep confidence in them, and vigorously support them in case of trouble, so that they will not be indecisive. Also, the third section of item B states that everyone knows the problems with corvée labor. If we can clearly stipulate the funds, it will not be difficult to gradually reform the situation, but the amount of funds is not small. What specific funds does the provincial treasury have to prepare for expenditure? If it exists only in name, it is still just a change of soup but not of medicine. The fourth section of item B states that people who accuse officials must provide security and guarantees, which is intended to investigate the truth and prevent false accusations. This matter must be strictly enforced, but we cannot do without measures to crack down on the abuse of telegrams to accuse officials. Also, the various sections of item C list four kinds of malpractices, all of which are true, but the report still does not have any reform measures. That is, the chairman's handling of the strike wave last year was only a temporary response. We must know that student unrest is incited by local bullies. If we can eradicate these local bullies, we will have a clear idea of how to handle the situation. As for bad principals and teachers, their qualifications should be revoked. For a small number of bad students, they should be expelled from school. For all bad students, the school should be closed down. In this way, we can save the declining morals in the slightest degree. Also, the first section of item D states that having roads but no cars is the same as having no roads. The difficulty of car operation is that military and political circles recklessly detain and use them, resulting in cars breaking down and companies losing money, so they will inevitably regard it as a dangerous path. If the province does not pay attention to road operation, I am afraid that it will be difficult for transportation to develop. Also, the final section states that the prohibition of opium is the most important political task of today. The headquarters of the three provinces have repeatedly issued strict prohibitions, divided into three periods, and checked and eradicated on schedule, clearly stipulating the death penalty. We should abide by these brilliant instructions, but the report states that in various counties in northern Anhui, some people are secretly in charge, inciting the planting of opium everywhere since the interregnum, with the intention of inciting unrest and expanding it. Reading this, I cannot help but be horrified. What are the commissioners and county magistrates of the province doing? For such an important political task as the prohibition of opium, which has been reiterated many times, why have they abandoned their duties to this extent? Moreover, there are heavy troops stationed in northern Anhui. How can there be no reason to suppress and sanction them? You should immediately check and eradicate them strictly. If opium seedlings are found when the time comes, we will definitely hold the director of the Civil Affairs Department and the responsible commissioner and county magistrate accountable, and we must not use empty words to perfunctorily deal with the matter. Except for the above-mentioned sections and those that need to be handled separately, the rest should be handled as proposed. The chairman should immediately act decisively based on the principle of using severe punishments in times of chaos, and we will vigorously support you regardless of any difficulties. If we can eliminate corruption and eradicate local bullies, then there is no fear that politics will not be refreshed one day. We have high hopes for this. This order." (February 26)</p>

<p>Malutang, which runs east-west, is the main trunk river in the Fifth District. It has been in disrepair for many years and is heavily silted. During the winter of the 20th year, when it was being dredged, the project was not even halfway completed when the January 28th Incident suddenly occurred, and it was suspended halfway. More than two years have passed since then, and dredging has not continued. Farmers and businessmen alike have suffered. District Chief Shen Buying, in view of this, planned to continue dredging and submitted it to the county for approval. He appointed District Chief Shen of the Fifth District as the director of the project office, and District Chiefs Yan Guangen and Wang Qingtao of the First and Fourth Districts as deputy directors to be responsible for the implementation. The dam was broken and construction began on January 16th. Now, thanks to the efforts of the director and supervisors, the project is already more than halfway completed, and it is said that it is scheduled to be completed by March 15th to maintain farmland irrigation.</p>

<p>Xu Henggan's family in Qianwanli Bridge shantytown near Suzhou Railway Station, due to carelessness with the lanterns hung for the Lantern Festival on the 13th night of the lunar year, caused a fire. At the time, because the drums and gongs of the Lantern Festival were being beaten loudly in the nearby shantytowns, no one noticed the alarm. It was not until the fire spread into a disaster that the dragons arrived on the scene. By the time it was extinguished, more than twenty families had been burned down. During the fire fighting, there was a conflict between the Fire Brigade and the Public Security Bureau's fire fighting team, and the two sides engaged in a brawl. Zhang Shoufu, a firefighter, suffered a hole in his head, and Li Xiushan and Li Yushan also suffered serious head injuries.

<p>Wang Er'a, an undecided thief and plasterer detained in the Wuxian County Local Court Detention Center, took advantage of the carelessness of the guards at 1:20 PM yesterday (27th) to jump up, climb onto the roof rafters, and tear off the roof. Because a tile fell to the ground, the guards discovered him and saw that the prisoner had jumped down from the two-zhang-high prison wall and disappeared. After a search was conducted in all directions, he was finally captured in a house at No. 15 Zhangjia Lane nearby.</p>

<p>Zhu Jiaqi, Minister of Communications, recently stated that the post and telegraph bureaus in various counties are both transportation businesses, but they have traditionally been independent of each other, not only lacking coordination in business but also wasting expenses. Therefore, he plans to merge the post and telegraph bureaus in various counties. The local telegraph bureau has received a clear order from the Ministry of Communications. According to the person in charge of the bureau, after the post and telegraph bureaus are merged, all post office branches will have telegraph receiving and sending offices. People can send telegrams at various post office branches without having to go to the telegraph bureau. Moreover, in various European and Western countries, the post and telegraph bureaus are combined into one. It is also heard that the merger will start with the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei, but Shanghai and other places will be temporarily postponed due to the difficulty of merging.</p>

<p>The rice and bean industry associations of Wujin and Wuxi counties decided to change the original commission of 99 for a string of cash to 98.4, effective from the 18th of this month, due to the drastic drop in grain prices and insufficient expenses. The two counties' associations jointly published a notice in the newspaper announcing the implementation beforehand. However, the Bengbu Grain Merchant Association and the Jiangsu Bengbu Grain Merchant Association and other groups believed that the private addition of commissions was exploiting the grain merchants, so they jointly submitted a request to the Department of Construction and the governments of Wujin and Wuxi counties, requesting the factory to add a ban to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Yesterday (26th), the County Government also received an order from the Department of Construction, roughly stating what the actual situation was and whether a ban should be imposed. It ordered a joint investigation and verification with the Wuxi County Government in accordance with the local commercial and economic situation and to report the investigation for consideration. In addition, representatives of the rice and bean industries in the two counties recently held a meeting and decided that, according to Bengbu's precedent, miscellaneous grains with a price of less than ten yuan per dan would have a commission of one jiao deducted, and those with a price of more than ten yuan per dan would still be calculated according to 99 for a string of cash.</p>

<p>Shen Baocheng's Nanhua store in Yuxian Town, Jiaxing, was robbed at about 9:00 PM on February 3rd, and more than 300 yuan in silver dollars were stolen. A report was made to request the arrest of the stolen goods. Now it is learned that after the Security Office received the report from the County Government, it stated that since the town has the Sixth Public Security Branch and district cadre team stationed there, and it is in a prosperous downtown area, it is undeniable that the case occurred due to ineffective defense and arrest. It has ordered County Chief Jiang to separately investigate and ascertain the police officers and Ding in charge and submit a report for review. At the same time, he should still urge his subordinates to strictly arrest and hand over the suspects for investigation without delay.</p>

<p>Special Mention</p>
<h3 id="e121">An Impressionistic Account of an Economic Survey in Guangxi Province (4): Qian Jiaxun <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>For more than a month afterwards, besides attending several banquets hosted by the provincial authorities, we devoted all our time to the study of existing economic data on Guangxi. We meticulously reviewed all kinds of publications published by various Guangxi institutions, newspapers, magazines, and the materials for the Guangxi Yearbook that the Statistics Bureau was compiling. We called this period the preparatory period for the survey. Before describing our impressions of the survey in detail, I will take this opportunity to first talk about the civil defense corps and highways in Guangxi.</p>
<p>The civil defense corps is one of the major policies to which the Guangxi authorities are devoting all their efforts. The provincial authorities have two slogans: "Embed soldiers in the corps, embed generals in schools." Regardless of whether this policy is right or wrong, we believe that their courage and spirit are worthy of deep attention from the people of the country. What does it mean to "embed soldiers in the corps"? This means militarizing the civil defense corps and civilianizing the military. Currently, all the civil defense corps in Guangxi Province are under the command of the provincial government chairman. They divided the civil defense corps of the entire province into six districts according to the old dao circuits (previously divided into twelve districts). Each district has one commander and one deputy commander. Below the district is the county, and each county has one commander and one deputy commander. The county magistrate concurrently serves as the commander, and the deputy commander is appointed by the provincial government. Below the county are the standing force, the reserve force, and the auxiliary force. The standing force is discharged every six months, twice a year. After discharge, they become the reserve force. The entire province has a total of two hundred and fifty-one standing force teams, each with ninety people. Each year, at least 40,000 able-bodied men receive military training. Regardless of their occupation (except for public officials and teachers), all members of the reserve force and auxiliary force, aged twenty to forty, are incorporated into the auxiliary force and perform civil defense duties. The reserve force and auxiliary force conduct large-scale autumn exercises during the slack farming season in autumn and winter. In addition, they select dates for further training. According to this method, it is estimated that 280,000 people can be trained in the auxiliary force each year, 40,000 in the standing force, for a total of 320,000 people. Within three years, one million able-bodied men can be trained. Assuming that the total population of Guangxi is 12 million, of which 6 million are women and 3 million are elderly, young, and disabled, there are still 3 million able-bodied men. If this plan is implemented step by step, within ten years, all able-bodied men in Guangxi will become elite soldiers. But now that there are soldiers, where will the officers come from? Therefore, they proposed the plan of "embedding generals in schools," that is, the training of civil defense corps officers. Military training is implemented in schools above the senior high school level in the province. Graduates can become civil defense corps team leaders or platoon leaders. Guangxi has four senior high schools and one university. All graduates are transferred to fill civil defense corps officers, which is sufficient for distribution. According to them, this method is good for the civil defense corps. For the students themselves, they will not be unemployed after graduation and become high-level idlers. They can handle civil defense corps and local self-government affairs. This is the training of lower-level cadres in the civil defense corps, which refers to peacetime. As for wartime, that is, during general mobilization, when a large number of cadres are needed, they can also be transferred from the civil defense corps cadre training center and graduates of schools above senior high school. From this point of view, after three years, the entire province will have one million able-bodied men who have received military training, and the lower-level cadres will also have a place to settle down. This is very noteworthy. As for the funding for the civil defense corps, in the past, the expenses of the headquarters and district headquarters were provided by the provincial treasury. The expenses of the county civil defense corps headquarters and the salaries of the standing force were raised locally by each county. Later, because this method was not only close to harshness but also led to embezzlement and corruption, from the 21st year, all expenses of civil defense corps organizations at the provincial, district, and county levels, as well as special service teams, standing forces, reserve forces, and various teams, were uniformly provided by the provincial treasury. The civil defense corps' firearms are also purchased by the government.</p>
<p>Regarding military training in schools, the Guangxi Provincial Government passed a regulation in May of the 21st year. All senior high school students must receive 1,200 hours of military training during their study period. In the first four semesters, the emphasis is on technical training. In the last two semesters, they specialize in academic courses. During the summer vacation of each year, they also conduct very strict field exercises for two weeks. The military academic subjects in the early stage are set at three credits per semester, and the later stage is set at one credit per semester. Military discipline is calculated according to conduct scores. Those who do not have enough military training credits or fail in military discipline are not allowed to graduate or advance to a higher school. Military training in various middle schools and Guangxi University is extremely strict. In addition to receiving military training, students must also enforce military discipline in the school. Mr. Bai Jiansheng said in a speech to students in Nanning, "High school students should not only actively train in military academic subjects, but also manage all students' actions with military management methods to make students' lives militarized and disciplined." However, because of the excessive emphasis on military management, abuses sometimes inevitably occur. A colleague at Guangxi University told me that last year, a military instructor at the school arrested two students and put them in jail, which caused a storm. The Nanning Republic Daily once published that a student at a certain school was expelled because he went to eat before mealtime. The last two sentences of the notice were, "Immediately expel the student from school to maintain military discipline and school spirit." Putting "military discipline" before "school spirit" shows their educational spirit. After the implementation of military training, it initially aroused opposition from students in various schools. Later, the authorities stated, "Guangxi is training the civil defense corps for national defense and conducting military training to train officers for foreign wars. If one person opposes, one person will be expelled. If the whole school opposes, the whole school will be disbanded." Later, more than 20 student representatives of Guangxi University were expelled, and this storm subsided. However, according to the authorities of various schools, the number of students who voluntarily withdrew from school due to military training is not small, and some have exceeded one-quarter. It is said that now even voluntary withdrawal is prohibited (a certain authority stated that even voluntary withdrawal must be investigated for family members). The number of withdrawals should be reduced. We are laymen in politics and do not want to elaborate on the advantages and disadvantages of this kind of military national education.</p>
<p>Next, let's discuss highways. Highways are the most obvious achievement in Guangxi's construction. Because Guangxi has not built railways until recently, transportation relies entirely on waterways. There are three main rivers in Guangxi: the Yong River, the Tan River, and the Liu River. Wuzhou is located in the lower reaches of the West River. All passengers and goods coming from the Yong, Liu, and Tan Rivers, that is, all passengers and goods from the entire Guangxi and parts of Yunnan and Guizhou, enter and exit through Wuzhou. Therefore, Wuzhou actually holds the transportation hub of the entire province. Although other ports such as Gui, Liu, Yong, Long, and Se all have waterways that can be used, every time during the transition between spring and winter, there are many shoals and the water is dry, and transportation is extremely difficult. Sometimes, ships have to go into the water to carry and lift them to overcome them. However, travel also takes ten days. Since the active construction of highways in recent years, as of recently, a total of 7,294 li of highways have been completed. The completed trunk lines are listed below:</p>
<p>Yongliu Road: Nanning to Liuzhou, 675 li</p>
<p>Liugui Road: Liuzhou to Guilin, 540 li</p>
<p>Guiquanh Road: Guilin to Quanzhou, 320 li</p>
<p>Guiyong Road: Guilin to Yongfu, 110 li</p>
<p>Lihe Road: Lipu to He County, 425 li</p>
<p>Dachi Road: Datang to Hechi, 430 li</p>
<p>Liuwu Road: Liuzhou to Wuxuan, 240 li</p>
<p>Liuchang Road: Liuzhou to Chang'an, 300 li</p>
<p>Bingui Road: Binyang to Gui County, 200 li</p>
<p>Bingshang Road: Binyang to Shanglin, 100 li</p>
<p>Yongwu Road: Nanning to Wuming, 120 li</p>
<p>Yonglong Road: Nanning to Longzhou, 640 li</p>
<p>Guiyu Road: Gui County to Yulin, 205 li</p>
<p>Yubo Road: Yulin to Bobai, 141 li</p>
<p>Yulu Road: Yulin to Shijiao, 220 li</p>
<p>Rongyu Road: Rong County to Yulin, 190 li</p>
<p>Rongcang Road: Rong County to Wuzhou, 200 li</p>
<p>Baiping Road: Baise to Pingma, 170 li</p>
<p>Danchi Road: Nandan to Hechi, 280 li</p>
<p>Yongyu Road: Nanning to Yulin, 235 li</p>
<p>(Other branch lines and county roads less than 100 li are not recorded)</p>
<p>The total length of trunk lines and branch lines reaches more than 7,200 li, which is indeed a great convenience for travelers. Since the completion of the highways, the journey that used to take 20 days can now be reached within two or three days. Taking Wuzhou and Longzhou, which are connected by navigable routes, as an example, it used to take three or four days to go from Wuzhou to Nanning by waterway, and another seven or eight days from Nanning to Longzhou, totaling more than ten days. Now, it takes one day from Wuzhou to Nanning, and one day from Nanning to Longzhou. In other words, it only takes two days from the easternmost part of the province to the southwesternmost part.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Italian Aviator Pennati Performed Again on the Bund Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Pedestrians craned their necks to watch, appearing quite crowded.</p>
<p>At the thrilling parts, they all gasped and exclaimed.</p>
<p>Italian aviator Major Pennati came to China and performed various amazing stunts at Hongqiao Airport on the 18th of this month, which was highly praised by all circles. In order to universally promote aviation and thank all circles for their kindness, Pennati specially took off from Hongqiao Airport at 12:00 noon yesterday, still driving his light trainer plane, and performed his amazing stunts in the sky around Nanjing Road, the Bund, and Yangjingbang. At that time, it was when the staff of various companies and institutions were returning to their residences for lunch, and watching this stunt, they all stood on the side of the road and craned their necks to watch. The roads suddenly became crowded. As for the various technologies performed by Pennati yesterday afternoon, although they were similar to the previous performance in Hongqiao, the Bund area is full of tall buildings of uneven heights. The body of the plane passed over the rooftops, and the thrilling scene made people gasp and exclaim non-stop. Yesterday, the weather was clear and sunny, and the sunlight shone on the body of the plane, shining brightly. Pennati performed his stunts in the air calmly. The rumbling of the engine shook the entire city. It was not until 12:15 that he flew towards Hongqiao and landed. Pennati plans to stay in Shanghai for about another month before he has to return home because he has agreed to participate in the radio-controlled flight test. In this test, the pilot only needs to sit quietly with his hands in his sleeves, and the plane's actions are all controlled by radio from the ground. Pennati hopes to visit China again in a few months. During this stay in Shanghai, he agreed with the National Government to purchase a Caproni-style bomber for night flights, which will soon be shipped from Italy. According to Mr. Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association, when the naming ceremony of the Tianchu and other four planes is held, he plans to invite Major Pennati to participate in the performance to arouse the public's interest in aviation. He has already sent a letter of invitation, but has not yet received a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Aviation Club to Be Established Early Next Month <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Training ground at Hongqiao Airport</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Chinese Aviation Association was established on New Year's Day last year. Its purpose is to gather public financial resources to assist the government in building an air force and enriching national defense. Therefore, its program of action has decided to raise huge sums of money to purchase aircraft as the first step, cultivate aviation talents as the second step, and then seek to establish its own factory as the third step. At the beginning of the association, Mayor Wu Tiecheng was appointed as the general captain of the fundraising team, and he raised more than one million yuan in three months. The association then contacted the government, reviewed the needs, and purchased 18 aircraft, which have been named and donated to the government and incorporated into the air fleet. The first step of the work can be said to have achieved considerable results. As for the second step of the work, the organization of the aviation club to train aviation talents, the association's board of directors has passed the organizational outline. However, due to the huge amount of money spent on purchasing aircraft, the funds have been insufficient, which has delayed the progress. Now, thanks to the enthusiastic support of young aviator Sun Tonggang, and his agreement to be responsible for the training, and the great concern from all circles, who have sent letters urging the association, the association has decided to promote its realization in the shortest possible time. More than a dozen initiators and sponsors of the club have been recruited. The initiators must be limited to those who have aviation knowledge and experience. Therefore, well-known aviators at home and abroad, such as Zhang Huichang and Chen Wenlin, are all on the list of recruits. The current director of the Aviation Administration, Xu Peigen, and the principal of the Aviation School, Mao Bangchu, are also listed as initiators. Wu Yunchu and Du Yuesheng have been listed as sponsors. Mr. Lin Wojiang, the secretary-general of the association who is currently responsible for the preparations, has drafted a report on the progress and has sought the consent of all the initiators so that it can be formally announced early next month. The training ground has been set at Hongqiao Airport, and it is planned to build several houses nearby for use as the last time. The office will be located in the association's office.</p>

<p>German Semi-Official Telegram Statement</p>
<p>Shanghai Times News Agency this city news: Recently, there have been widespread rumors at home and abroad that Germany and Japan have been negotiating under a certain tacit agreement and will break the League of Nations' resolution not to recognize Manchukuo and recognize "Manchukuo." After this telegram came out, it aroused serious attention from all circles in our country. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the German Ambassador Todtmann yesterday, asking him to express his true attitude. A reporter from the Shanghai Times News Agency specially visited the German Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Barendes, yesterday to inquire about everything. Mr. Barendes formally and responsibly declared to the reporter that the foreign telegram was absolutely not true. As far as he knows, the German government has no such action and hopes that the Chinese people will not easily believe the rumors. Mr. Barendes also showed a semi-official telegram sent from Berlin yesterday, which also firmly denied this rumor. The original telegram stated that recently there have been rumors that Germany and Japan are conducting negotiations with the intention of recognizing Manchukuo and negotiating a trade treaty with it. All of this is purely fictitious. The relations between China and Germany are very harmonious. The German government has no such preparations. The dissemination of this rumor is obviously another function of a certain party, attempting to alienate the feelings between China and Germany. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally declared to all parties that this statement is unfounded. Mr. Barendes finally told the reporter that he dared to guarantee the reliability of the above telegram.</p>
<h3 id="e128">River Steamer Companies Revise Mail Freight Rates <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Freight Rates Increase with Waterway Levels</p>
<p>Steamer and Postal Sides Have Agreed</p>
<p>The River Steamer Alliance has raised prices, and the previously set waterway rates have been abolished and replaced with new freight rate sheets. The transportation of mail packages between Yichang and Chongqing is relatively large compared to other places. In recent years, more and more Hakka people have changed the goods they transport to River goods into mail packages. However, they are still transported by steamers. The previously set prices for mail package waterway fees are also no longer suitable. Steamer companies have also increased prices accordingly. The Postal Administration has re-signed postal transportation contracts with various steamer companies, and the prices have also changed. It was agreed yesterday and will be signed today. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Steamer Companies Sign Contracts <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>This time, the waterway rates for River steamers have increased sharply. Because the companies are working together, the amount of freight has increased by more than double the original amount. River merchants have unanimously opposed it, but there is no way to resist it except to stop transportation. River mail packages are particularly numerous, especially goods. The Postal Administration, in response to this fee increase issue, has negotiated with the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Zijiang, China Merchants, Sanbei, Minsheng, Guangyao, and French-flagged Fuyuan steamer companies that operate on the River river waterway and has discussed the River mail package waterway contract for many days. The draft contract was sent by the Post Office to the various steamer companies for signing and implementation yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e130">New Freight Rates Have Been Agreed <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The River mail package waterway freight is divided into upstream and downstream, as well as shallow water season and flood season. The agreed freight rates, which are noted in the contract, focus on the Yichang-Chongqing section, that is, the upstream section. The mail freight for this section is 60 yuan per ton during the shallow water season from November to the end of March each year, and during the flood season from April to the end of October,</p>
<h3 id="e131">National Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs the German Ambassador to Ask for Clarification of Rumors of Recognition of the Puppet Manchukuo <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the news that the German government was about to recognize the puppet Manchukuo came out, our country was shocked. In addition to telegrams from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed the German Ambassador yesterday, asking him to telegraph the German government to formally deny the puppet Manchukuo in order to promote friendship. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Respected German Minister in Beijing, I have recently heard international rumors that your country will change its previous attitude towards the Three Eastern Provinces incident. Although this is clearly the creation of alienation, intending to destroy the feelings between the two countries, I think your country must have a formal expression to stop the rumors. I have also checked that your country's argument was fair at the League of Nations last year, which was praised by our country. This further promotes the progress of cooperation between the two countries' industries and businesses, causing jealousy of conspirators. In order to maintain the future of the two countries' industries and businesses, our association specifically telegraphed your minister to check and forward the above matter to your country's government for formal expression, in order to dispel doubts. The National Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China expresses its gratitude.</p>
<p>The freight rate is 45 yuan per ton. There is also the Chongqing downstream to Yichang section, which is also divided into shallow water season and flood season. During the shallow water season, the freight rate is set at 27 yuan per ton, and during the flood season, it is 20 yuan.

<h3 id="e132">Rumors in Banking Circles About the Government's Attitude Towards the Silver Agreement <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports: According to news from banking circles yesterday, our government feels quite difficult to deal with the silver agreement. If it is not approved, then the government did send personnel to attend at that time, and it would be inconvenient to go back on its word and eat its own words. If it is approved, then speculators will transport silver out on a large scale. At the same time, foreign goods are imported, and our country lacks the ability to exchange goods. For example, soybeans, a large commodity produced in the Northeast, have been seized by the puppet Manchukuo, and the silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has suffered a setback. The tea industry in Anhui is also gradually declining in exports. Therefore, the arrival of foreign goods must be paid with silver ingots, and foreign merchants will refuse to accept the 88% silver content factory bars from the Central Mint, and they will have to pay 99% silver content factory bars. All of this is enough to cause a panic of silver. Therefore, the central government has invited experts to study it in the long term and observe the situation. Although our government has not temporarily approved the silver agreement for a while, but it is delayed until a considerable time, and I am afraid that it will not be possible to not approve it after all.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Economic Expert Xu Peikun Discusses the U.S. Raising Silver Prices <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After the United States implemented a policy of raising gold prices, it has recently proposed raising silver prices again, attracting worldwide attention. Our country, as a silver-using nation, will naturally be affected in many ways, and we should prepare countermeasures in a timely manner. However, the changes in silver prices and their relationship to our country's economy are extremely complex. A simple analysis cannot fully reveal the underlying meaning, nor can it be clearly explained by using a few foreign terms. Moreover, President Roosevelt's implementation of gold and silver policies to cope with the extremely panicked global economic environment is an immortal achievement, benefiting both the world and people's hearts, and making great contributions to the welfare of the people. We should sincerely and carefully study the cause and effect of his policies, as well as our country's response, so that in the midst of the surging economic tide, our country may be able to save itself from its predicament. To explain the relationship between raising silver prices and our country's interests, we must first understand the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The Reasons for Low Commodity Prices in Our Country The causes of commodity price fluctuations are extremely complex. Some are caused by the expansion and contraction of the money supply, some by cost factors, and others by supply and demand. There are many conflicting theories, making it difficult to determine what is correct. However, the expansion and contraction of the money supply, to some extent, is related to commodity prices, hence the quantity theory of money. However, it would be a grave error to assert that the expansion and contraction of the money supply has a direct proportional relationship with commodity price fluctuations, and to hastily regard the amount of money as the sole cause of commodity price fluctuations. Commodity price changes depend on the times, environment, and factors. Sometimes there is only one cause of change, and sometimes there are several. Experts in various countries have discussed this in detail, so there is no need to elaborate here. Examining the prices of various commodities in our country in recent years, they have been declining step by step. Although there are multiple reasons for this, the relationship with the money supply is extremely minimal and not worth mentioning. Taking the silk industry as an example, foreign markets have long been seized by Japan and other countries, while the domestic market has suffered a double blow. First, the people are suffering from the pressure of economic depression, and their purchasing power is extremely weak. Second, the invasion of artificial silk from various countries is very popular among the people, and its promotion is extensive and far-reaching, leading to the gradual decline of our country's inherent silk industry and the fall in silk prices. As for the tea industry, foreign markets have long been taken away by India, Ceylon, and other countries. Our country's black tea has been abandoned, and green tea sales are better, but due to its low quality and sluggish sales, our country's black tea has plummeted. As for the cotton industry, in recent years, yarn prices have continued to fall, and the reason is entirely due to natural disasters and man-made disasters. The Northeast market has been seized, while the price of cotton has slightly increased, which is due to the insufficient domestic cotton supply, not the amount of money. As for rice, wheat, flour, and miscellaneous grains, their prices have all fallen uniformly, and the reason is entirely due to the dumping of foreign grains in our country's market. To sum up the above-mentioned commodity prices, the cause of their changes is definitely not the money supply. Now let's cite an example to prove the contrary. In recent years, the amount of silver flowing into Shanghai from all over the country has been increasing day by day. In January of the 20th year of the Republic of China, it was 275,573,000 yuan (converted into silver dollars), and in December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, it was 508,230,000 yuan, an increase of almost onefold. Why is it that other commodity prices have fallen, except for rent, which has increased? The reason for the increase in rent also has special reasons, which will not be discussed for the time being. From this, it can be seen that the amount of money has little causal relationship with commodity prices in our country.</p>
<p>(2) The Reasons for the Formation of International Trade To put it simply, goods from countries with low commodity prices can definitely be imported into countries with higher commodity prices for sale, and the cash of the importing country must flow out, and commodity prices will fall accordingly. The situation in the exporting country is the opposite. Cash inflows cause commodity prices to gradually rise. Items that could be sold abroad cheaply in the past are now being imported from other countries cheaply. What was previously a trade surplus is now a trade deficit, and gold must flow out again. It flows continuously and follows its course. However, this situation does not exist in our country. Suppose, as some people worry, that after the price of silver increases, the commodity prices in our country will have to fall. Then it is impossible for expensive foreign goods to be imported into countries with low commodity prices, and cheap goods from our country can be imported into countries with high commodity prices. What do we have to fear? Suppose again that if the price of silver increases and the prices of goods are suppressed, our cheap goods still cannot be exported. Then can we increase the export of expensive goods when the price of silver falls and the prices of goods rise? When gold was expensive and silver was cheap the year before last, commodity prices also fell. People thought that exports would definitely increase greatly, but the result was greatly disappointing. Those who care about current affairs can still remember this. In short, our country's international trade is not absolutely based on changes in the price of silver, but on whether Chinese and foreign merchants can make a profit. Our country's domestic market has become fragmented due to internal turmoil and external troubles. Our country's industry and commerce depend entirely on the promotion of international trade to boost it. This is what we should consider carefully when discussing the price of silver.</p>
<p>(3) The Problem of Silver Outflow If the United States implements a policy of raising the price of silver and absorbs silver in the Chinese market, then the outflow of silver will inevitably become a problem, without any doubt. However, this problem is not difficult to deal with, and there is no need to panic. Recall that in May of last year, the price of silver in New York was 15% higher than the price of silver in Shanghai. How much silver flowed out at that time? Even if foreign goods are dumped in our country's market, silver must flow out. Since our country has always been a country with a trade deficit, silver must flow out (unless our country stops all trade with other countries). But at the same time, we must pay attention to the expenses of foreign government officials, travelers, missionaries, etc. in China, and all investment funds remitted by overseas Chinese to China must be paid in silver. Therefore, the silver that flows out will still flow back. Moreover, the United States will definitely not rashly raise the price of silver and immediately absorb and transport it away. When it is necessary to preserve silver, it can be dealt with. If we advocate prohibiting the export of silver and levying export taxes on silver at this time, it will cause panic, shake credit, and affect the public debt market. Therefore, it is better to remain calm and let things take their course.</p>
<p>(4) The Problem of Gold and Silver Standards Our country is on the silver standard, while the United States is on the gold standard. Our positions are different. The United States is a silver-producing country, while our country is not. Therefore, when the price of silver rises, silver producers can obtain huge profits, while non-silver producers have no benefit. Therefore, the interests conflict. Why should we advocate raising the price of silver to benefit others? This argument is not without reason. However, this point is actually self-defeating. If our country does not want to raise the price of silver, the opposite is to raise the price of gold. How can raising the price of gold not benefit others? How can our country transform from a non-gold-producing country to a gold-producing country in an instant? Our country is neither a gold-producing country nor a silver-producing country (we may be able to mine large amounts of gold and silver in the future). Therefore, the rise and fall of gold and silver prices is a problem. Our country's only goal is to seek an appropriate method to stabilize the prices of gold and silver, so that we are not affected by the drastic changes in these prices. It is not like England, which has gold mines, or the United States, which has silver mines, where there are conflicts of interest. When the price of gold soared the year before last, our country was fortunate to adopt the silver standard and was not swept into the vortex of the collapse of the gold standard. Now that the price of silver is gradually rising, we can make good use of the opportunity and use this huge amount of silver value. The government may impose strict supervision on imported goods and prohibit the import of various unnecessary consumer goods, so as to avoid unnecessary increases in trade deficits. When the price of silver rises to a considerable level, a stable and appropriate ratio can be established with the price of gold, and countries can adopt the same monetary system. After that, trade between countries will never be affected by the ratio of gold to silver. The smokescreen of currency is gone, and in the future, international trade will depend entirely on the commodity prices and production costs of each country as tools for competition. In fact, the effect of the currency smokescreen in China is extremely minimal, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>(5) The Impact of Our Country's Tariffs If the price of silver rises, tariff revenue, converted into silver dollars based on customs gold, will inevitably decrease. Assuming that one customs gold unit could be exchanged for two silver dollars in the past, now that the price of silver is high, it can only be exchanged for one and a half or one silver dollar. The loss will naturally be considerable. Although this conversion loss is unavoidable, we can also predict that the quantity and value of import and export trade can increase, and the total revenue of the customs can definitely increase. The result after conversion can also increase. Currently, due to the slight increase in the price of silver, the silk market has shown signs of activity, and transactions have gradually begun. The export goods from North China to the United States in January of this year increased by about 70% compared with the same month last year. The advantages and disadvantages of raising the price of silver can also be seen from this.</p>
<p>In summary, when we study the issue of silver prices, we must adopt scientific methods, stand in the position of a third party, and seek the welfare of the public. I respectfully offer my humble opinions as an ordinary citizen, and I hope that readers will correct me.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Sanctions for Non-Membership in Guilds <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Prerequisite for Implementing Economic Control</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, stating that in August of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, affiliated guilds, including the Sausage Industry Guild, the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry Guild, and the Cosmetics Industry Guild, jointly stated that all members of the same industry should join the guild, and the legislative body had established clear provisions. The current issue to be discussed is how the administrative body should implement this. Therefore, the affiliated guild submitted a request to the Executive Yuan on the 31st of that month, requesting that the Executive Yuan stipulate sanctions for non-membership in guilds. If this matter has no implementation method, then Article 7 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Guilds, even though it changed the word "may" to "shall" in the phrase "Companies and firms in the same industry shall be members of the same industry guild," companies and firms would turn a blind eye, and the law would still be a dead letter. Therefore, there must be an implementation method to implement the spirit of the amendment to that article. Moreover, supplementing the implementation method is based on the authorization of Article 7 of the Guild Law, which is the authority of the administrative body, not the legislative body. Therefore, at that time, it was not submitted to the Legislative Yuan separately for this reason. Later, on September 12th of the same year, a letter was received from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, which stated that the President had instructed that the matters presented should be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review. The letter was copied and sent for reference. After that, how the Ministry of Industry decided was not known. Earlier, in June of the 22nd year, more than 90 guilds, including the Sausage Industry Guild, stated that those in the same industry who resisted joining the guild should be punished as resisting national administrative power, and forced to join the guild. The affiliated guild submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs to submit it for review. On December 27th of last year, the Bureau issued an order through the Municipal Government to the Ministry of Industry, No. 21883, stating that this matter had been forwarded to the Executive Yuan to consult with the Legislative Yuan for relief. Later, an order was received from the Yuan, approving the Legislative Yuan's reply, stating that the case had been ordered to be jointly discussed by the Economic and Commercial Law Committees of the Yuan. The members of the committees believed that companies and firms in the same industry should join the guild. The seventh article of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Guilds had been amended to state that companies and firms in the same industry shall be members of the same industry guild, and it was promulgated by the National Government on September 15th of the 21st year. There is no need to amend other articles at this time. The intention of the Legislative Yuan seems to be that the implementation method regarding membership does not need to go through the legislative process again. Therefore, it resolutely decided that there is no need to amend other articles again. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry further stated at the end of the consultation that "there is no need to discuss the matter of resisting membership" as the conclusion of the case. As for how to deal with those who should join the guild but resist joining, the Legislative Yuan believes that there is no need to amend it again through the legislative process, and the competent ministry has not issued an order to implement the law based on its authority. The effect of the clause in Article 7 of the Guild Law that all members of the same industry should join the guild is equivalent to being completely eliminated. If the ministries believe that compulsory membership is not necessary, then if there are already seven or more members in the same industry, there is no need to force them to organize a guild according to the law, and Article 7 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Guilds should not have been amended from "may be members of the same industry guild" to "shall be members of the same industry guild." Now, one party believes that there is a need for compulsory membership, while the other party believes that there is no need to discuss the matter of resisting membership. The legislative intent is obviously inconsistent. In the past two years, the number of trade deficits has been the largest in our country's trade history. The theories of production control and economic control have been very popular for a while, wanting to rely on this as a remedy. With the vastness of our country's territory and the inability to concentrate administrative power, it is impossible to imitate Europe and the United States and implement control overnight. We rely on each industry itself to have a strong and powerful organization, each implementing individual control within its scope of business, so that it can be a solid barrier to resist the rising tide of economic invasion. Therefore, the tasks undertaken by industrial and commercial organizations today are different from those of the past, and the legislative intent should also change with the times. Moreover, what is being requested now is not the issue of compulsory membership, but how to implement the compulsory membership permitted by law. This matter has been discussed for years, but there has been no result. Many of the guilds under the affiliated guild have been virtually suspended because of this. The life of a guild depends on its members. Those who have not joined cannot be forced to come, and those who have already joined gradually leave due to the heavy burden of obligations. How can it be expected that it will not avoid collapsing? In this situation, how can it be expected to fulfill its mission and share a part of the task of controlling the economy? Therefore, the repeated reminders of the affiliated guild are not for the survival of the guild, but for the rise and fall of the national economy. Therefore, without fear of being presumptuous, we reiterate the previous request, hoping that your Yuan will consider and approve it, and properly stipulate an appropriate implementation method for companies and firms in the same industry that should join the guild but consistently refuse to join, so that there is something to follow. This is really for the public benefit.</p>

<p>The Fujian Western Overseas Group Relief Association, feeling that the overseas Chinese crisis is imminent, telegraphed the government yesterday to seek relief. The telegram is recorded as follows: Chairman Chen of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Nanjing National Government. We, the overseas Chinese, are scattered in various countries around the world. In the past, the number reached more than 20 million. However, in recent years, due to extreme oppression by local governments, no less than millions have fled to foreign lands and returned to the country in a state of distress. In addition, the Dutch government has promulgated harsh regulations, Mexico has been fiercely anti-Chinese, and the massacre of overseas Chinese by the Siamese government last year was even more tragic. Most of our overseas Chinese are engaged in industry and commerce, and the economic power of various places over the years has been in the hands of the Chinese. In recent years, due to extreme abuse by local governments and the impact of the global recession, overseas Chinese have no place to stand. They cannot stay, and they cannot return. Those who have returned to the country are suffering because their hometowns are in chaos. At this time, when the overseas Chinese crisis is imminent, we hereby telegraph to earnestly request your association to actively find ways to settle overseas Chinese and provide relief to returning overseas Chinese. As for the massacre of our overseas Chinese by the Siamese government, which is outrageous and extremely illegal, we earnestly request that the government appeal for a strict settlement and conduct a thorough investigation to maintain the national honor and comfort the feelings of the overseas Chinese. The telegram is urgent and awaits orders. The Fujian Western Overseas Group Relief Association kowtows.</p>

<p>Dagong News reports that the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions telegraphed the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the Mass Movement Guidance Committee, and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that regarding the selection of labor representatives for this year's International Labor Conference, the union had suggested that labor circles in various places should independently elect one to three comrades with experience, and then the central government should make the final decision, in order to comply with the organizational regulations of the conference, and to consult the public opinion of the national labor circles. It had also sent Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Long Peiyun, Shao Xubai, and other four comrades to Beijing to petition. The Ministry (Committee) sent personnel to reply, stating that the representatives for this year would be selected from labor circles who have experience, knowledge, and sound physiques. The standards for the candidates proposed by the union have been adopted. However, it has recently been rumored that a certain Central Committee member has been recommended to attend as the labor representative. Upon hearing this, we were extremely surprised. Although this news has not been confirmed, there must be a reason for it. Since the interests of labor are involved, the union is more concerned. Therefore, we specially telegraphed to inquire about the truth. If it is true, we should request an immediate withdrawal and reconsider it in order to live up to the expectations of the labor circles. Otherwise, in order to implement its proposals, the union will unite with labor circles in various places and directly telegraph Geneva to deny it. This is to inform you, hoping you will consider and approve it. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Reorganization Plan for the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Since Wu Baofeng took over as the director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, he has been working diligently to reorganize it. He has now drafted various reorganization plans and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications for approval, after which they will be implemented. The reorganization content discussed by Wu is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Striving for Commercialization <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Wu first stated that wired telegraphs are affected by the establishment of long-distance telephones and wireless telegraphs. However, the imperfect internal layout of the bureau is also a major reason for the impact on business. Therefore, I will adhere to the principles of commercialization and rationalization in the future and gradually seek reform. The style of the existing buildings and the internal layout all affect business. Although we are limited by funds and cannot completely reform it, we should at least make the building layout like a store and strive for business convenience. Telegraph businesses in European and Western countries are mostly run by merchants. Although China is state-owned now, it cannot be regarded as a government office. We should still adhere to the spirit of business and strive for commercialization.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Cooperation between Wired and Wireless <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Wu further stated that the Ministry of Communications is planning to merge the operation of wireless telegraphs and wired telegraphs. Most European and Western countries adopt this method. Although this cannot be realized in a short period of time, wired and wireless telegraphs each have their own strengths. We should adhere to the spirit of mutual cooperation and avoid each going its own way. Wired telegraphs may not be as effective as wireless telegraphs in terms of business methods. However, this can only be improved by improving business methods and striving for speed and convenience, which can also be easily remedied. Therefore, I will ensure that the service personnel in the bureau not only make it convenient for the message recipients, but also strive for speed when sending messages. All of this is what I expect to be realized in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Notice to Navigating Vessels to Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Office of the Navy issued an announcement that the reefs and rocks in the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong, due to obstructing navigation, are now being bombarded by the Guangdong Customs. The location is at 113 degrees 15 minutes east longitude and 23 degrees 14 minutes north latitude. During the bombardment of the reefs, a special announcement is issued to inform all ships that when passing through the area during navigation, they should pay special attention to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>Stopping Operation if Inspection is Not Requested within the Deadline</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications previously stated that Chinese and foreign sailing ships have been old and dilapidated for a long time. Sailing in the outer rivers, they are prone to collapse in the event of wind and waves, which endangers the safety of passengers. Therefore, it specially instructed various shipping companies to have the ships inspected by personnel sent by the Ministry. If the ships are too old or internally decayed, they will be ordered to stop operating to ensure the safety of passengers. At present, shipping companies are enthusiastically applying for inspection. However, there are also not a few ships sailing in remote areas that have not applied for inspection. The deadline for the ship inspection was originally set at the end of December of the 22nd year. Later, to facilitate the inspection of ships from remote areas, it was specially extended by half a year, with the end of June of this year as the deadline. If the inspection is not requested according to the law after the deadline, their operating licenses will be stopped.</p>

<p>Feng Xingcai and other workers at the China Merchants Huazhan Wharf in Pudong initiated the organization of a workers' savings mutual aid association, practicing self-management. In May of last year, it was approved and registered by the Party and government organs and the wharf business office. Since its establishment, there have been no disputes. Unexpectedly, someone is not allowing the workers to work, is restoring the foreman system, and is using gangsters to cause trouble. It is said that the association will petition the Municipal Party Department, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Wharf Business Office in the near future, requesting the abolition of the commission foreman, and punishing the troublemakers who have been bought by the capitalists. It is not known how the Party and government organs of this city will resolve this dispute.</p>

<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, feeling that the Yellow River flood has caused severe disasters in the provinces of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong, with no less than 3 million victims, has launched a fundraising campaign in major cities across the country to raise funds for agricultural relief for the Yellow River disaster. Fundraising in Shanghai is being conducted by the commission's Shanghai office at 49 Nanjing Road. The donations received have been successively remitted to Beiping and then to the disaster areas. It is heard that the commission has achieved good results in providing agricultural relief loans in Heze, Shandong, and has lent out about 20,000 yuan. The work has been promoted to Dongming County. The donations remitted to Beiping from various parties amount to about 80,000 yuan. It is also heard that Mr. Mei Lanfang's charity performances in Beijing raised about 10,000 yuan for relief, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission has also agreed to donate 5,000 yuan to promote it.</p>

<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Mackenry Lane has over one hundred houses, housing four to five hundred tenant families, mostly laborers. Since the Shanghai War, many have lost their jobs. Last August, the landlord forcibly ordered each household to pay a monthly water fee of two yuan. However, the tenants opposed this. After mediation by the court, it was ruled that the landlord's reasons were insufficient and did not comply with the regulations of the water company. The increase in water fees was rejected. Yesterday, the tenants of the lane suddenly received a notice from the Banca di Credito Italiano, demanding payment within a limited time. The notice stated: "To Whom It May Concern: Since last August, when the water company forced the installation of water meters, our water expenses have increased severalfold. We notified each tenant to pay an additional water fee per household, and most tenants have been paying monthly. However, your household and two others have not paid. We hereby warn you to pay the outstanding water fees from August last year to the end of December, totaling ten yuan, within twenty-four hours. If you fail to pay, we will be forced to stop the water supply and request the court to evict you. We sent two Western bank employees on Tuesday, the 20th of this month, to notify you verbally, so you cannot claim you were not informed. In any case, we consider your refusal to pay the monthly two yuan water fee as a regular notice of termination of lease. Therefore, we will rent out your leased property from April 1st onwards." Upon hearing this, the tenants decided to hold a representative meeting within a few days to discuss how to respond.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Tea Merchants See No Progress in Trade with Russia <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Russians Want Credit, Chinese Merchants Cannot Provide It</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports: Since the resumption of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, all industries have sought to promote sales to Russia. Regarding tea exports, which traditionally constitute a large part of trade with Russia, this reporter visited tea merchant Chen Yizhou to inquire about the recent situation. According to him, the resumption of Sino-Russian relations has had little impact on tea merchants. Russian tea buyers do not consider the country of origin, only prioritizing low prices and requiring credit. For example, when buying tea from British merchants, they stipulate payment nine months later. When buying tea from Japanese merchants, they stipulate payment one year or eighteen months later. However, when buying from Chinese merchants, they insist on cash payment. Therefore, although Sino-Russian diplomatic relations have been restored, tea trade has not progressed because of the differing credit terms. Last year, the Guohua Bank lent one million silver dollars to the Russian Trade Cooperation Society, which the Russian merchants used to purchase Chinese tea. At that time, tea merchants felt a slight improvement in business. Unfortunately, the loan was too small. If several million more dollars could be lent, the future of tea merchants would be unlimited. Chen also provided approximate figures for tea trade with Russia since 1927, as recorded below:</p>
<p>1927: Approximately over 10 million yuan</p>
<p>1928: Approximately over 12 million yuan</p>
<p>1929: Approximately over 8 million yuan</p>
<p>1930: Approximately over 6 million yuan</p>
<p>1931: Approximately over 5 million yuan</p>
<p>1932: Approximately over 4 million yuan</p>
<p>1933: Approximately over 4 million yuan</p>
<p>The above figures include both Shanghai and Hankou (exports from other minor ports were minimal), and include black tea, green tea, tea dust, etc. The reporter also inquired about future plans for the tea industry. According to Chen, the only reason for the lack of progress in tea trade is the weak capital of Chinese tea merchants, which prevents them from offering credit. He hopes the government can provide loans to Russian merchants, enabling them to purchase as much Chinese tea as possible. In this way, trade with Russia may return to the state it was in 1928.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a cotton shop at No. 384 Avenue Edward VII in the International Settlement caught fire due to carelessness. Cotton and similar materials are highly flammable, so the fire quickly spread through the roof and to neighboring shops at No. 382, a confectionery shop, and No. 386, a fruit shop. Flames soared into the sky, making it impossible to approach. Fortunately, nearby constables spotted the fire and immediately reported it to the Fire Brigade, which dispatched fire engines to extinguish the blaze. However, the fire was raging and difficult to control. Around 9:00 AM, the fire was gradually extinguished. As a result, three buildings were destroyed. At the same time, it was discovered that a 53-year-old woman named Kang Wei, who lived upstairs at No. 384, was missing. Firefighters searched the area and found her body inside the fire scene. She had been burned to death, her body charred beyond recognition, a tragic sight. The relevant police station sent detectives to transport the body to the morgue for examination, while also investigating the cause of the fire for further action.</p>

<p>Police Open Fire, Wounding Three</p>
<p>The Sino-American Petroleum Company's storage facility is located at the Yangshupu Wharf in Pudong. Loading and unloading of oil products at the facility has traditionally been handled by workers from Yangzhou and Shandong. However, competition for work has led to frequent disputes, and resentment has grown over time. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, as Yangzhou workers were beginning work at the Sino-American Petroleum Company, Shandong workers attempted to intercept business. Yangzhou workers discovered this, leading to a verbal altercation. Other Yangzhou workers arrived to support their side, creating a potentially violent situation. Shandong workers also rallied in response. About two hundred workers from both sides gathered, creating a noisy scene. Unable to reach an agreement, they armed themselves with carrying poles and engaged in a direct brawl. Police officers from the Public Works Bureau learned of the incident and rushed to suppress the riot and mediate between the parties. However, the Yangzhou workers, feeling they were in the right, refused mediation and claimed the police were biased. They created difficulties for the police. During the chaos, a small number of workers shouted and charged toward the police. The police, fearing for their lives, fired warning shots into the air. However, the workers did not disperse and continued to attack with carrying poles. Unable to do otherwise, the police fired live rounds, hitting and knocking down three leading workers. The crowd hesitated to advance further. At the same time, police officers from the Fourth Precinct of the Third District arrived to maintain order. The riot was prevented from escalating. The three wounded workers were all shot in the legs and are not in critical condition. They were transferred by the Fourth Precinct of the Third District to the Sacred Heart Hospital in Puxi for treatment. Further reports will follow regarding the resolution of this case.</p>

<p>Lei Atang, a native of Ningbo, 18 years old, previously worked as a nurse at the Pingmin Obstetrics Hospital on Huade Road and then transferred to the Da Zhonghua Hospital in Xin Hui Le Li on the Fourth Avenue as a medical intern. Lei was exceptionally intelligent and made great progress in various fields. Recently, after clinics, he frequented brothels and often returned late at night, which displeased the hospital director. He was suddenly dismissed a few days ago. Lei was greatly affected by this and lost his place of residence, feeling depressed. The day before yesterday (26th), he checked into room 321 at the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. In the evening, he made a phone call to a Miss Yuan at the Pingmin Obstetrics Hospital and then went to sleep. At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, a female called and asked for the guest in room 321, claiming she was calling from San Ma Road. The doorman, after answering the phone, went to knock on the door of the room, but received no answer for a long time. Suspecting something was amiss, he forced the door open and entered. He saw Lei lying stiffly on the bed, having swallowed poison, barely breathing. Realizing the situation, the doorman reported to the front desk, who in turn reported it to the Zhabei Police Station, sending Officer No. 42 to investigate. The Lei was transported to the Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that he ingested too much poison, and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Minutes of the Shareholders Meeting of the China Realty Company <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The China Realty Company, an American enterprise, held its eighth annual shareholders meeting on February 27, 1934, at the company's office in Shanghai. Mr. Satterlee, the vice president of the company, presided over the meeting, making the following announcement to the shareholders: "According to the schedule set for today (4:30 PM), a quorum has been reached. I request the company secretary to begin by reading the notice of the annual shareholders meeting." Notice of the Annual Shareholders Meeting of the China Realty Company: This year's annual shareholders meeting of the company will be held at the company's office at 290 Sichuan Road, Shanghai, on Tuesday, February 27, 1934, at 4:30 PM. All shareholders are expected to attend punctually. If a shareholder wishes to appoint a representative due to other matters, please submit the authorization form to the company's office before 5:00 PM on February 26th to be valid. Furthermore, the transfer of the company's shares will be temporarily suspended from February 19th to 27th, according to regulations. This is hereby announced. Andaom, Secretary of the China Realty Company, By order of the Board of Directors. The company's financial statements have already been sent to all of you. If you approve, I will assume they have been read. From the perspective of a real estate company, 1933 was a most difficult year. Money was unusually loose in the market, and property owners could easily obtain financial assistance. Therefore, owners were unwilling to sell below cost, including interest and expenses. At a time of commercial recession, buyers only sought to purchase cheap properties. Shanghai was affected by the global economic downturn, which our company managed to avoid in the first half of 1932. However, it was not spared in the second half. Based on my past experience, I believe Shanghai will soon return to its original state. The item regarding the China Realty Trust Company in the balance sheet has surely caught your attention. This company is a British company registered in Hong Kong, handling the registration of British titles. Regarding the increase of 1,387,389.71 silver dollars in the company's assets, I would like to clarify to all of you that this increase represents properties purchased this year, which the company believes are cheap and can generate substantial profits. The company expects to profit in the future. The 18 million yuan mortgage was successfully negotiated by the company after nearly a year. I believe this mortgage is an unprecedented personal mortgage in Shanghai. Although it was completed in 1933, the funds were only paid after the company's year-end closing, so it was not included in the financial statements. In 1933, the company handled business totaling 40,015,800 silver dollars, more than the 33,413,200 silver dollars in 1932. However, this figure does not include rental income, property management, insurance, trust, and other miscellaneous income. Finally, I would like to inform all of you that the Board of Directors believes shareholders should enjoy reasonable returns on their investment. The company's smooth operation depends on your financial support. If you agree, the Board of Directors proposes to distribute a dividend of 1.40 yuan per share. If calculated in silver dollars, this dividend is slightly higher than 10 percent. Before any resolutions are made, I am willing to answer any questions you may have." Resolution 1: "I propose that all of last year's business reports, financial statements, and the 1933 dividend of 1.40 yuan per share be approved by everyone present. In addition, the remaining balance of 381,351.18 silver dollars be transferred to the next year's surplus account." Rong Shangqian seconded. Passed. Resolution 2: "Mr. Satterlee and Mr. Sattary have voluntarily resigned from their positions as directors, but they are still qualified to be re-elected, so they will remain candidates." Mr. Li Wei proposed, and Mr. Rong Shangqian seconded, that Mr. Satterlee and Mr. Sattary be re-elected as directors for the next term. Passed. Resolution 3: "Mr. Andaom proposed, and Mr. Li Wei seconded, that E. Maurer, accountant, be appointed as the company's auditor for 1934." Passed.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Astrologer's Scare Tactics: Wealthy Widow Duped Out of Three Thousand Gold Pieces <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Stacks of Banknotes Transformed into Layers of Wastepaper</p>
<p>Fraudulent Enough to Forge Deposit Slips for Collateral</p>
<p>Yang Letian from Wuxi is engaged in astrology and divination. He formerly had a sign posted at the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road. Whenever wealthy merchants and tycoons went to discuss their fortunes with him, he would cleverly flatter them with flowery language and speak freely, occasionally using threatening words to instill doubt and fear in his listeners. He would then take the opportunity to blackmail them. There are many victims. For example, the manager of a well-known cigarette company was almost tricked out of ten thousand gold pieces but fortunately woke up early, avoiding the loss. Yang's deceptive tactics can be seen from this. However, there are many superstitious people in Shanghai. What Yang cannot do to one person, he can do to another. Recently, there was a major case in Suzhou where a</p>
<h3 id="e155">Wealthy Woman <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>was swindled out of three thousand gold pieces. The woman, named Xu Ruqun, was married to a man named Bao. Not long after, her husband died, and she became a widow, residing at No. 14 Yile Lane, Danshui Road. Although she is now thirty-eight years old, she is very superstitious. She is also wealthy and likes to burn incense to worship Buddha and consult fortune tellers and physiognomists. Her friend Zhu Baozhen had previously consulted Yang. After being flattered by Yang, she believed his skills were magical and encouraged Xu to go to the Oriental Hotel on August 27th of last year to inquire about her fate. After meeting and talking, Yang observed Xu's psychology and noticed her</p>
<h3 id="e156">Exquisite Clothing <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>He suspected she was wealthy and immediately used his usual tricks, saying her upcoming years would be unlucky and her life palace was unfavorable. If she did not perform rituals to avert these disasters, not only would calamities befall her, but her life would be in danger. He made all sorts of frightening claims. Xu fell for his tactics and begged him to find a way to eliminate the bad luck. Yang asked for fifty gold pieces, claiming it was for the cost of dispelling the stars' influence. Xu gave him the full amount. On September 20th, Yang invited Xu to the Oriental Hotel again, saying that her misfortune could not be averted with just fifty gold pieces. She needed to add one hundred and twenty-eight yuan, which he would use to set up an altar in Wuxi to perform rituals. Xu complied and gave him the money. After just ten days, Yang invited her again by phone to go to the Oriental Hotel. He said, "Of the one hundred and twenty-eight yuan you gave me earlier, forty gold pieces were unclean money, which offended the deities. Not only will it not eliminate the disasters, but it will cause more trouble,</p>
<h3 id="e157">Offending Heaven." <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>While he was speaking, he deliberately looked worried. Xu was very frightened when she saw this and begged for help. Yang initially said there was no way to remedy the situation, but then said he would try. He told her to prepare three hundred gold pieces for use. On October 7th, Xu brought the money to the Oriental Hotel again. After Yang took her banknotes, he told her to face the wall. In an instant, he wrapped something in paper and gave it to her to hold. At the same time, he burned yellow paper with cinnabar symbols drawn on it and told her to draw a similar symbol on a piece of paper, burn it, and then take the paper package home and store it. He told her not to open it without being instructed to do so, otherwise her life would be in danger. She respectfully listened to his instructions and took the package home. In reality, the three hundred yuan banknotes were already in</p>
<h3 id="e158">His Possession, <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>He had replaced them with wastepaper inside the package. If Xu had not been frightened by his scare tactics and had opened the package upon returning home, the scam would have been exposed early on, and she would not have continued to lose her wealth. However, her superstition was too deep, and she regarded the paper package as a dangerous object, placing it without daring to touch it. Until December 6th, Yang saw that the victim was not doing anything and figured that nothing had gone wrong. So, he again invited Xu by phone to go to the Yangtze Hotel and intensified the threatening nature of his conversation. He said that if she wanted to receive divine protection, she should add another eight hundred gold pieces. He also induced her by saying that the money would still be kept by her as before, and it could not be used only during the ritual period. In reality, there was no loss at all. Xu still followed his orders. The next day she brought the money. Yang also</p>
<h3 id="e159">Followed Suit, <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Only replacing the paper package with a cigarette box. However, the relationship between the two had become very close. Yang learned about Xu's wealth and thought that he could not just rely on this method to deceive her. Therefore, he forged a two thousand yuan deposit slip issued by the Lu Zhenda Foreign Goods Store on Robert Street. On January 6th of this year, he summoned Xu to his house at No. 8 Airen Lane, Avenue Petain, to discuss the difficulty of dispelling the stars' influence. When he asked Xu to add another four hundred yuan, he used the deposit slip as collateral for one thousand five hundred yuan. At this time, Xu still deeply believed in him, so she regarded the forged document as genuine, without any hesitation, and gave him the money. In total, from August 27th to that time, Xu had been swindled out of more than three thousand gold pieces. However, she still had not realized it. Recently, she happened to talk about it with her friend Gu Fan, who was not as foolish as her.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Determined It Was A Scam <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>She insisted that Xu open the paper packages and cigarette boxes that she had brought back each time. Xu was still hesitant at first, but after being persuaded by Fan again and again, she opened them one by one. Sure enough, they were all wastepaper. Xu deeply regretted it and went to Yang's house on February 19th to negotiate. Yang, fearing that if it were publicized, this trick would be difficult to use again and that he would be even more guilty, in order to ease Xu's anger, in addition to writing a confession, he also gave her all the rosewood furniture in his apartment and a car number 2998, valued at two thousand yuan, as compensation. However, the next day Xu discovered that the Lu Zhenda's deposit name,</p>
<h3 id="e161">Was Also A Forgery. <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>It was like pouring oil on the fire. Xu then went to the New Gate Police Station to report the incident, requesting an investigation. The day before yesterday, Detective Ruan Yao and Detective Huang Siming arrested Yang Letian. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhan Liangce conducted a preliminary hearing. After the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case, he requested that the defendant be punished according to Article 363 of the Criminal Code. Xu Ruqun also recounted the process of being repeatedly defrauded. When the defendant Yang Letian was questioned, he admitted to receiving the various amounts of money from Xu, but claimed that he had a special relationship with her and that the money was not obtained through fraud. He also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. Judge Zhan, believing that the case still needed investigation, ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Another Three Thousand Dan of Large Yellow Croaker Imported</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the Japanese fishing vessel "Wanichi Maru" transported the first batch of Japanese fish for import, fishermen in this city have been feeling extremely uneasy. Unexpectedly, just a few days later, another three thousand dan of Japanese large yellow croaker were imported this week. It is said that each dan is priced at only twelve yuan, and most of them are transported to the capital. Only a small portion is sold in the Shiliupu area of this city. The detailed reports obtained from various sources are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Large Quantities of Yellow Croaker Imported Again <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The three thousand dan of Japanese fish imported in the most recent week are all large yellow croaker, transported by Japanese merchants. They are unloaded at the Oriental Air Conditioning Company, operated by Japanese in Yangshupu. The fish are caught in the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Most of them are transported to Nanjing, packed in cardboard boxes with the words "Kyodo Co., Ltd." marked on the outside. In Nanjing, they are repacked in wooden buckets, using the domestic "Qian Feng" brand to masquerade as domestic goods. Relevant parties in this city have repeatedly telegraphed the Anti-Japanese Association in Nanjing for inspection, but due to their rigorous methods, it is difficult to find any flaws. Therefore, the small-scale fish markets run by Chinese will be taken over by them.</p>

<p>Moreover, according to Jin Chuxiang, former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Fish Inspection and Price Stabilization Committee, although the Russian side has allowed a re-bid in the recent fishing area bidding dispute between Japan and Russia, if Japanese merchants fail again, the fishing industry of our country's seven coastal provinces will be completely plundered by the Japanese. The Japanese have already built fish markets in Dalian and other places and will further explore the South China Sea's fish producing areas. He hopes that the fish market organized by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will be established as soon as possible, so that people all over the country can work together to boycott them and save the situation.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, because the American Consul in Shanghai, Mugue, carelessly ran over and killed Mao Xiaolong, a Ningbo native residing in Chongque place in Songjiang, while driving to Hangzhou on January 13th, on the Huhang Highway near Caobing Branch Road, telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate reasonably for compensation. It has now been learned that the association received a letter from the secretariat of the provincial government yesterday, stating that the case has been handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the American Minister Johnson to handle it according to the law. The original text reads: "To Whom It May Concern: According to the Chairman's instructions, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai sent a summary of Mao Xiaolong's family's request for compensation, requesting that negotiations be conducted. The case should be investigated and responded to. After investigation, the county government of Songjiang telegraphed that the family of the deceased requested that compensation be calculated based on the deceased's current age of 56, living to the age of 70, with a monthly pension of 30 yuan, covering 14 years.

<p>Meeting of Manufacturers Called for March 3rd</p>
<p>To Discuss All Procedures</p>
<p>The National Products Manufacturers United Association of this city believes that our country's rural economy has broken down, and the industrial and commercial sectors are also gradually declining. The root cause is the dumping of goods in China by various countries. If this continues for a long time, the most prosperous city of Shanghai will inevitably fall into a state of panic. The general public still takes pride in buying foreign goods. Some misuse foreign goods because they do not recognize national products. The association, seeing this, has repeatedly held national goods movement exhibitions in the Penglai Market in Southern Shanghai and the Foch Road in the Special District to awaken the public's attention. It has now been learned that the association, for the sake of widespread publicity, plans to hold a National Products Movement Exhibition in the Zhabei Charity Group Hall on Datong Road in the Northern District of Shanghai. Previously, Commissioner Cai Qiaojun was sent to negotiate with Mr. Wang Binyan, the person in charge of the Zhabei Charity Group, and Wang has already agreed. The association has specifically scheduled a first meeting on March 3rd at 2:00 PM at the association's office at 160 Baker Road to discuss the procedures.</p>

I recently received an order from the National Government stating, "If there is indeed an invention, detailed drawings and explanations should be submitted to the Central Research Institute or the relevant local authorities for verification and processing," etc. I, along with others, already submitted the drawings and specifications to your ministry's Central Industrial Testing Laboratory last year. It is unknown whether a response has been issued. This matter has been previously reported. As the situation cannot be delayed any further, I respectfully re-submit this to your office, requesting prompt assistance. If this engine is not a reality, I, along with the others, am willing to accept the charge of deception and fraud, and even if it means imprisonment and the death penalty, we will accept it willingly. This matter concerns a national invention, so I earnestly request a prompt response. I am waiting with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, by submitters Chen Xinbiao and Shan Chunqiao, kowtowing together.</p>

<p>Donation of 10,000 yuan</p>
<p>On February 21st, 1934, the French Concession Public Welfare Association held a board meeting where they discussed participating in the construction of a leper asylum near Shanghai. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city previously initiated a fundraising campaign to build a leper asylum. The location has been chosen as Wusong, so that those suffering from leprosy can receive treatment and prevent the spread of this terrible disease. The French Concession Charitable and Public Welfare Association has always worked diligently to eradicate leprosy and has donated funds to the China Leprosy Relief Association annually. In order to promote the association's charitable goals and public health, the association has decided to participate in Mayor Wu's fundraising campaign for leprosy and has formally notified the China Leper Asylum Construction Conference of its willingness to donate 10,000 yuan, so that the conference can complete the construction as soon as possible and fulfill its grand aspirations.</p>

<p>Within the Joyful Social Gathering</p>
<p>Lies the Intention to Promote National Products</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Engineers Association held a social gathering at the Paramount Ballroom on the evening of the 26th. Members and their families attended, with over 700 people, including Wu Yun-chu, Zhu Mao-cheng, Li Zhao-huan, and Shen Jun-yi. The ballroom was spacious and not crowded. The organizing committee made meticulous arrangements in advance, with matching seat tickets and seating charts, so the order was well maintained and without any confusion. Inside the venue, the four characters for "Engineers Association Annual Meeting" were formed by Yongnianhong lanterns donated by the Dongfang Yongnianhong Company, dazzling and eye-catching. The gathering began with an opening speech by Chairman Xu Pei-huang, who explained that the purpose of the social gathering was to connect members and promote friendship. However, because national construction is lagging behind and the central government is advocating for production and construction, and because the members of this association are researching engineering and engaging in construction work, there were many items on the program tonight related to national products, with the intention to promote national products within the joyful social gathering. The generosity of the Dongfang, Ya Mei, Sida, and Ya Guang national product factories in donating products for the raffle tonight is deeply appreciated. Wang Sheng-shan, director of the organizing committee, reported on the preparations. Organizing committee members such as Yang Xi-liu, Feng Bao-ling, Jin Zhi-xuan, Su Zu-xiu, Zhang Zhi-kang, and Zhu Shu-yi have worked hard and sacrificed the most time in recent days. Next, Xu Shan-xiang, a technical supervisor from the former Ministry of Industry, gave a speech on the current status of national products and how to promote them, with many cautionary words. After dinner, Chen Rui-lin sang the national product opening song written by Qi Fanniu, advising women to use national products and encouraging engineers to do their best in production enterprises. This was followed by a national product drama and national product performance by female employees of the China National Products Company, which was captivating. Then came the distribution of gifts, which everyone in attendance enjoyed. Among the valuable gifts were electric fans from the Hua Sheng and Hua Tong factories and Luo Na silk clothing from the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory. Those who won the prizes were overjoyed, greatly encouraging the use of national products. After each program ended and before the next program began, there was social dancing, ending with the Paramount Dance. The grand scale of this meeting exceeded that of previous years, and the attendees left satisfied, already past midnight.</p>

<p>Zhang Yecheng Wants to Take Back His Daughter</p>
<p>And Sues His Divorced Wife for Illegal Detention</p>
<p>|Tears in the Courtroom…Moved Onlookers|</p>
<p>Zhang Yecheng, from Nanjing, works in political circles and runs a hotel in Nanjing. In 1912, Zhang met Zhao Fenfang (also known as Zhao Hengzhen), a local woman from Shanghai, who is now thirty-nine years old. They developed a close relationship and pledged their lifelong love. They lived together in the capital and had one son and one daughter. The son is now nineteen years old, and the daughter, named Dezheng, also known as Lianjun, is only thirteen. However, around 1922, Zhang was suddenly arrested by the authorities due to certain circumstances and imprisoned. Zhao Fenfang, disagreeing with Zhang's mother, came to Shanghai alone.</p>

<p>After Zhang was released from prison, he learned that Zhao was in Shanghai, so he tracked her down, demanding that Zhao return to Nanjing to live with him. Zhao refused, and the two separated that year. The children were raised by Zhang. Although Zhao and Zhang were separated, the relationship between mother and son and mother and daughter remained unbroken. Therefore, even after ten years, Zhao still went to Nanjing from time to time to visit her children. Recently, Zhang Yecheng suddenly filed a lawsuit at the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Zhao Fenfang of abducting his daughter Zhang Dezheng. The court issued a document to Zhang, ordering him to go to Shanghai to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Zhao's Whereabouts <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Zhang brought the document to Shanghai a few days ago and stayed at the Pacific Hotel on Guangxi Road. He learned that Zhao lived at No. 15, Jiuxingli, Baker Road, and that his daughter Zhang Dezheng had changed her name to Zhao Lianjun and was studying at the Daodao Middle School on Avenue Haig. He then presented the document to the First Special District Court, requesting an arrest warrant, which was issued to the Xin Zha Police Station, along with Chinese Detective Su Yinggen and Western Sergeant Michael Whelan. The police went to the above two locations at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to arrest Zhao Fenfang and Zhao Dezheng and took them to the police station.</p>

<p>They were detained temporarily and transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, stated that the police station had gone to arrest the individuals based on the court's arrest warrant and that both parties were present in court, requesting an interrogation. Zhang Yecheng stated that he was forty-five years old, working in political circles and running a hotel in Nanjing. In 1912, he met Zhao Fenfang in Shanghai, and they lived together in Nanjing, having one son and one daughter. The son is now nineteen years old and is in Nanjing, and the daughter is Dezheng, who is thirteen years old. In 1922, he was involved in</p>

<p>Afterwards, he separated from Zhao. However, for the sake of human relations, Zhao often went to his mother's and children's home in Nanjing every year. On the morning of December 17th of last year, Zhao suddenly came to Nanjing secretly, first having tea at a tea house in the Confucius Temple. Because his daughter Dezheng was studying at the Municipal Confucius Temple Elementary School at that time, Zhao secretly took Dezheng away and took a car to Shanghai. He did not know about this at the time until the next day when he learned that his daughter was missing and had been deceived by Zhao. He then filed a complaint with the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor's Office.</p>

<p>This time, he was ordered to go to Shanghai to investigate Zhao's whereabouts and actions. He did not know her address until yesterday, so he requested the court to issue an arrest warrant. However, Zhao's behavior in Shanghai is improper, and he does not want to say more. Zhang Dezheng stated that she was thirteen years old, that Zhang Yecheng was her father, and that Zhao Fenfang was her mother. She used to study at the Municipal Confucius Temple Elementary School in Nanjing. Because she had no English, her mother came to Nanjing last year and took her to Shanghai to study at Daodao Middle School. At that time, her father sent her and her mother</p>

<p>Zhao Fenfang confessed that she had lived with Zhang in Nanjing after meeting him in 1912. Later, Zhang was arrested and imprisoned for political reasons, and she disagreed with Zhang's mother, so she came to Shanghai alone. In 1926, after Zhang was released from prison, he came to Shanghai and wanted her to return home. She refused, and they lived together in Shanghai for more than a year. Later, Zhang suddenly filed a criminal lawsuit against her in court, accusing her of escaping with money, which was very malicious. As a result, the case was not established, and the two separated. Although the relationship between husband and wife had ended, the relationship with her children could not be severed. Therefore, she went to Nanjing every time</p>

<p>Last winter, she heard her daughter Dezheng say that the schools in the capital did not have English courses, so she took her to Shanghai to study. At that time, Zhang also sent them to the station. Now, Zhang has suddenly sued her over the issue of loving his children. He already loves his biological children, and she also loves her biological children. Moreover, one son has already been sent to him, and one daughter should belong to her. If he wants to take back his daughter, there is room for discussion, and he should not use such vicious means to make things difficult for her. Tears streamed down her face as she spoke, moving all the onlookers. Her attorney, Liu Gongbing, also gave a statement. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the statements and ordered Zhang Dezheng to be taken back by her father first. Zhao Fenfang was released on bail and ordered to report to the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Before a guarantor could be found, Attorney Gu was temporarily responsible for the guarantee.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Guest Returning from Xi'an Discusses the Establishment of the Xijing Midwifery School <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Shaanxi Private Xijing Midwifery School was founded with a donation from Ms. Fu Xuewen, the wife of Provincial Chairman Shao Lizi, who also serves as the school principal. Ms. Fu is currently in Shanghai for medical treatment and to plan for the school's fund. A guest who recently returned from Xi'an mentioned that the school officially opened on February 18th. Ms. Fu entrusted the president of the provincial hospital, Mr. Shi Jieren, to serve as the acting principal. The school temporarily enrolled forty students and will expand in the future. All tuition, lodging, and book fees are waived. On the opening day, many guests gathered together and gave many speeches, making it a grand occasion. The following is an excerpt from the speech by Chairman Shao Lizi: It is naturally not easy to promote a matter, especially to handle midwifery education. Judging from the old midwifery methods in the past, the surgery was clumsy and did not pay attention to hygiene, unlike the new methods of today, which, in addition to disinfection, also apply scientific and rational surgery, so that both mothers and newborns can be safe. Our country has not been able to promote this kind of education until now because the conservative ideas are too deep, always thinking that we have our own national civilization, so we do not learn from others' improved new methods. For example, Japan, before the Meiji Restoration, learned our Chinese books. After the Meiji Restoration, they learned the new medical techniques of Europe and the United States. Therefore, Japan's current medical techniques and theoretical aspects are very famous in the world. In our country, midwives are one of the practitioners of medicine, but they cannot improve the old methods of delivery and do not know how to accept new methods. This phenomenon is really inappropriate. Now that the midwifery school has been established, although the time is relatively late, it is hoped that everyone will devote themselves to learning, and it is not too late. In the future, after completing this kind of education, we must contribute to society. In today's semi-civilized society, most people may not believe in what we have learned, but since we have learned this kind of education, it is naturally our permanent occupation. For pregnant women, we must take care of them with all our hearts to avoid harming the lives of both mother and child. Furthermore, the old midwives do not care about people's lives, they only care about money. The trained midwives are very lazy. When delivering babies for others, they often do not perform the surgery carefully and do not disinfect for others. This is contrary to benevolence. I hope that everyone will encourage each other.</p>

<p>Monopolizing the Patent for Over Twenty Years, Seducing Chinese Children</p>
<p>Our Annual Losses Reach 150,000 to 160,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Rubber balloons, children's toys, sell especially well during the New Year. Available in all colors, they fly and dance in the sky. Children play with them for a short while before they are destroyed, as they are extremely fragile toys. Yesterday, it was learned that rubber balloon toys have always been imported by the Japanese. Although they are small items, the annual sales in our country amount to a huge sum of 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, which is also a significant financial drain. The best imported quality balloons cost about 20 cents each, which does not seem to match the purchasing power of Chinese children. For over twenty years, the Japanese have monopolized the patent for these toys. There are many national rubber product factories in Shanghai, but no one has paid attention to this product. It has now been found that the Jin Xing Arts and Crafts Factory in Zhabei is manufacturing and selling these balloons in this city. It has been in operation for half a year and has achieved excellent results, producing about 100 baskets of balloons per day. The trademark is Jin Xing, and it is also a start-up business among national products. It has been found that the raw materials for balloons are raw rubber, zinc oxide, linseed oil, and gasoline, four kinds. When the raw materials are vaporized to a certain extent, countless two- or three-inch-long glass tubes are used. One end of the tube must be large and bulbous. The bulbous end is dipped into the pot and fully coated with the solution. They are then inserted upside down onto nails and stood up to cool. Then the balloon blank is formed. Depending on its tightness, it can be pulled down from the glass tube one by one after solidification without being destroyed. To make it a balloon, it is then inflated with air to make it expand. Then the mouth of the balloon is tied with a thread, and it can be inflated at any time. Each basket sells for about 1.20 yuan.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of January 4th of this year, Chen Lanfang was entertaining guests at the Juhua Courtyard, No. 2 Hongyun Lane, Rue Wagner, French Concession, in the room of prostitute Lin Juxian on the third floor. At around 9:00 PM, Zhou Hongsheng, a Chinese detective from the Public Concession, took off his loaded handgun because of an urgent need and hid it under the pillow on the bed in the room. When he turned around to go to the toilet behind the bed, his friend Chen Linrong, out of curiosity, took out the gun to play with it, accidentally touching the trigger. The bullet flew out and injured the prostitute Lin Juxian in the abdomen. She died despite medical treatment. The police arrested Chen Linrong and sent him to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. The trial concluded, and Chen Linrong was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for causing death by negligence. Chen, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. This has been reported previously. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Chief Justice Guo of the High Court, along with Associate Judges Sun and Fan and Prosecutor Zhang, opened the Third Criminal Court for trial. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the police station, appeared in court. Appellant Chen Linrong stated that he did not actually take out the gun to play with it. He was lying on the bed, and when his head was on the pillow, he felt a hard object touching him under the pillow. When he touched it with his hand, the bullet was fired, causing the accident. The officials then summoned the witnesses Hu Bingchen, Qiu Ruqing, Chen Lanfang, and Zhou Hongsheng to testify about the circumstances at that time. They also ordered Zhou Hongsheng to demonstrate how he placed the handgun on the bed. The court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to a later date.</p>

On January 1st of this year, they robbed the Si Huisi Watch Store at No. 297 Avenue Edward VII, selling the watches for money. After the case occurred, detectives Lu Jinbao and Cao Fuchang and Chinese Detective Cheng Yuming of the French police station learned of it and arrested the two thieves, Hu and Lu, confiscating a six-shot automatic pistol and five bullets, and 31 original stolen watches. They were sent to the Second Special District Local Court, and the police station's lawyer filed a public prosecution for robbery. The details of the interrogation have been reported previously. The trial has now concluded. Yesterday was the sentencing date. At 10:00 AM, the police sent Hu and the others to the court, where Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the First Criminal Court. Hu Amao was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for each of the two robbery crimes, with a total of eight years of imprisonment. Lu Heshang was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for each of the two robbery crimes, with a total of five years of imprisonment.

<p>Grand Opening of "The Merry Monarch". The long-awaited palace romance epic "The Merry Monarch" premiered yesterday at the Grand Shanghai Theater, with three shows day and night. The audience was extremely crowded. The film is the latest masterpiece of world-renowned star Emil Jannings, co-starring the glamorous actress Sherry Boots and 5,000 beautiful Parisian girls. It depicts the amorous history of a king who married 365 concubines. Scenes such as three thousand beauties, competing in beauty on the seashore, hundreds of concubines competing for favor in the deep palace, are truly soul-stirring. The opulence of the background is unmatched by any other palace film. Therefore, audiences are praising it unanimously. It is reported that after Jannings returned to Europe, all the films he starred in were in German dialogue.

<p>To the Editor, I recently read a news item in your newspaper dated February 26 about a dispute over the French Concession's restrictions on rickshaw licenses. It does not conform to the facts. Regarding the French Concession's recent restrictions on licenses, our association has repeatedly petitioned the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for assistance and has sent representatives to appeal to the French authorities to provide appropriate relief to unlicensed rickshaw operators. All of this is documented and witnessed by the rickshaw operators. Recently, the unlicensed rickshaw operators, after long waiting with great anticipation, on the 24th of this month, dragged about 60 to 70 unlicensed rickshaws to the entrance of the lane where our association is located (namely, Sanminfang) intending to petition the French Concession authorities together. However, due to a dispute over the levy of one yuan per rickshaw, and because some rickshaw owners did not bring the rickshaws they had promised, the group was uneven, and the crowd was noisy and disorderly. The protest ended without results. At that time, no one was publicly elected as the general representative, and no resolution was made to question the association's handling of the matter. It is clear that someone fabricated the news to confuse the public. Correspondingly, we request your newspaper to make a correction. Respectfully addressed to Mr. News Editor, Shen Bao. Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association. Standing Committee Members: Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, Song Yaokun. February 27.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read in the local news column of your newspaper dated February 27 that the Chinese Red Cross Society will hold a re-election and is scheduled to host news reporters tomorrow.

We have specifically scheduled a reception for news reporters on the 28th and will host a banquet for the team leaders on the 2nd. There will be no re-election or communication matters. We respectfully request a correction. Respectfully addressed to the Editorial Department, Shen Bao. Sincerely, Chinese Red Cross Society. February 27, 1934.</p>

<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>
<h3 id="e215">Where Should We Start When Studying International Issues? (2) <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Before answering the several questions you have asked, we feel that we should offer a few words about your "life problems."</p>
<p>From your letter, we know that you are a young person with quite a bit of life experience and also possess a spirit of striving in the struggle for survival. What is currently facing you is the threat of unemployment, which makes you feel that "the future is not optimistic," which is understandable. If we look at this terrible phenomenon of unemployment from the perspective of an individual's future, we cannot avoid feeling "sadness from within." However, if we can see that this is a complete social problem, and that the solution to this problem requires the joint efforts of the masses to first eliminate the bad roots that produce unemployment, then you may not only avoid being pessimistic and passively discouraged by the current hunger, but you will instead develop the courage to fight and maintain a positive outlook for the future! Therefore, while we admire your striving spirit, we must further hope that you will take another step forward and first eliminate the gray thoughts in your hesitation, indecision, and timidity!</p>
<p>The following are answers to the several questions you have asked.</p>
<p>First, you ask whether someone in your living situation "should" and "can" study international issues. We can answer definitively: you "should" study and also "can" study. The reason is simple: today's world is no longer the era of our ancestors. Today, the nations of the world have been linked into a system by a kind of economic tie. There is no longer a piece of land on Earth that can escape the control of today's economic relations. Therefore, the lives of people in every corner of the Earth today are inevitably affected by the world. For example, the United States needs Japanese raw silk, Britain imports huge amounts of grain from all over the world, Japan needs Chinese coal and iron, Russian and American oil, and Indian cotton. China imports American Mobil kerosene, Lancashire cotton cloth, German pigments, fertilizer, machinery from various countries, and Japanese daily necessities. At the same time, China also exports tea, silk, tung oil, soybeans, etc. Everyone has already established close economic relations; they are interdependent and have become a global economy. At the same time, because this relationship takes the form of capitalist production relations, all that is seen in the world are blocks of business markets, thousands of factories producing for the market, and many markets and factories linked together to form economic spheres. These economic spheres are what we call nations, and they are all manufacturing, selling, and competing for markets in a state of anarchy, engaging in economic, political, or even cultural (in the narrow sense) "alliance" and "axis" struggles. However, if something goes wrong in one sphere of the world, it will affect the whole, like a chain where if one link comes loose, it will affect the whole. People living in the world today, whether you are British, Japanese, or Chinese, are all, without exception, directly or indirectly affected internationally. You can no longer close the door and escape reality; you are tightly bound by this network of economic relations, not allowing you to dream of living like the mythical emperors of the past.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current situation of the Chinese people, you cannot help but pay attention to what is happening internationally every day; for example, the current American purchase of silver is not just an economic policy of the United States; it will affect the lives and deaths of the Chinese masses. Why? Because the purpose of the United States in raising the price of silver is to encourage foreign dumping. China is a country that uses silver, and undoubtedly, on the surface, it will be found that China's purchasing power is strengthened (it is not a real increase in purchasing power, but American goods are taking the place of Chinese domestic goods). American goods will flood the Chinese market like a flood with this stimulus, and China's only agricultural market will be replaced by American goods. At that time, it will not only cause the outflow of silver, creating a shortage of currency and causing financial chaos, but the biggest disaster is that it will accelerate the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Therefore, although this event happened in the United States, we cannot but care about it.</p>
<p>Also, the recent Austrian issue, the bloodshed before Paris, the autonomy of Mongolia, the independence of Xinjiang, and the encroachment on Xikang in Tibet, etc., have now become international issues, because these not only have a life-and-death relationship with the Chinese masses, but also affect the world government. All this should be noted not only by the government authorities, but also by us ordinary people, so that we can understand what countermeasures today's government authorities are taking to deal with these problems, and whether they are safeguarding the interests of the masses. If not, how should we supervise them and how should we promote the demands of our people and break through the current national crisis?</p>
<p>Therefore, people like you should naturally study international issues. As for whether you "can," that is even less of a question, because as long as you are willing to study, even an illiterate worker can discuss it with others through conversation, let alone someone who already has the tool of writing?</p>
<p>Second, where should we start when studying international issues? How can we develop correct awareness? Given your level, we feel that you should start with research methods. Originally, international issues are a branch of social science, and the research methods are of course the methods of researching social science.</p>

<p>Beiping Gathers Senior Transfer Students and New Students</p>
<p>Beiping Social Bureau Details the Reasons Why Prohibition is Necessary</p>
<p>When the Ban Will Be Lifted Will Be Determined After Sending Personnel to Inspect</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) Wu Baojian, the representative of the joint association of private middle schools in Beiping, who went to Beijing to petition, arrived at the Ministry of Education on the 27th to petition. Secretary Zhou Chen presented the intention, and Minister Wang immediately met with Representative Wu. He explained in detail the situation of private middle schools in Beiping recruiting senior transfer students, and requested that the Ministry of Education give special consideration to the senior transfer students that have already been recruited by the schools this time, and find ways to help them. Minister Wang replied in general: (1) According to the middle school regulations, it is stipulated that middle schools can recruit transfer students, but the local educational administrative organs, when reorganizing the schools in their jurisdiction, may prohibit or restrict the recruitment of transfer students and new students when they deem it necessary. This time, the Beiping Social Bureau listed the reasons why it must prohibit the recruitment of senior transfer students to the Ministry, and the Ministry has approved the record. As for when the ban on recruiting senior transfer students in Beiping will be lifted, it will be determined by the Ministry sending personnel to inspect the extent of the educational reorganization in Beiping in the future. (2) As for how to resolve the issue of the transfer students that have already been recruited by the schools this time, it still needs to be handled by the Beiping Social Bureau. Finally, he informed the representative of the handling process of this matter by the Ministry of Education this time, urging the representative to return to Beiping quickly and not delay the operation of the schools.</p>
<h3 id="e217">The Compilation Process of the China Education Yearbook <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has compiled the first China Education Yearbook, which is scheduled to be published in April. The following is a record of the compilation process published by the colleagues involved in the compilation:</p>
<p>Since the rise of education in our country during the late Qing Dynasty, educational historical materials have accumulated and become complex. Recently, yearbooks have been compiled among provinces and cities for the purpose of comprehensive observation, but they are limited by region and scope. A national yearbook for the whole country is still lacking. The former Minister Zhu Gong saw this and, on March 16 last year, instructed the former Compilation and Examination Department to quickly compile an education yearbook. This is how the first China Education Yearbook came to be.</p>
<p>Considering the complexity of the matter and the difficulty of proceeding, on March 23, Director Zhang Xiushan, Director Guo Xinsong, Director Gu Shusen, Director Li Zheng, Counselor Yang Fang, and Counselor Chen Shizhen were appointed to assist Director Xin Shuzhi of the Compilation and Examination Department (who was later appointed Director of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau after the Compilation and Examination Department was merged into the Bureau) to jointly plan and organize the first China Education Yearbook Compilation and Examination Committee to oversee all compilation and examination matters, and to set up a compilation office responsible for drafting manuscripts. Thus, on April 25, Director Xin Shuzhi, Director Zhang Xiushan, Director Guo Xinsong, Director Gu Shusen, Director Li Zheng, Counselor Yang Fang, Counselor Chen Shizhen, Counselor Chen Panzao, Counselor Wu Chuzhou, Secretary Gan, Secretary Liang Jikang, Section Chief Zhang Fanjiu, Section Chief Xie Shuying, Section Chief Guo Youshou (later appointed Specialist), Section Chief Dai Yingguan, Section Chief Wu Yanin, Section Chief Zhong Lingxiu, and Section Chief Peng Baichuan, Section Chief Wang Ruiyuan and other nineteen people were appointed as compilation and examination committee members, with Director Xin responsible for convening meetings. Zhou Shuxian, Wang Fengtong, Gong Zhengtao, Ke Shuping, Qian Wangjunzhuo, Gao Weichang, Wu Yonglong, Huang Longxian, Cai Yuxin (deceased) of the Higher Education Department, Zhang Weigao, Wang Wanzhong, Weng Zhida, Chen Zhe, Xue Tianhan, Huang Wenqi of the General Education Department, Gu Liangjie, Guo Lianfeng, Jin Guisun, Shu Chushi, Gao Hongtu of the Social Education Department, He Bolie of the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department, Xue Quanzeng of the Examination Department, Li Yiyan, Hu Yanli, Zhou Qidong, Huang Shuzhong, and Ding Zhiping of the Compilation and Examination Department, and Zhou Bangdao and other twenty-eight people were appointed as compilers, and Zhou Bangdao was appointed as the chief compiler. Later, due to slight changes in the Ministry's personnel and many official duties, Gao Tinzhi, Shen Pengfei, Zhang Jiong, Section Chief Qiu Changkang, Specialist Cheng Qibao, Specialist Yang Lian, Specialist Li Ximou, and Specialist Li Jiaxiang were successively appointed as compilation and examination committee members, and Zuo Zhong, Zhao Huang, Li Gongming, Ding Yizhong, You Chunmao, Fan, Mai Guoren, Li Guanglie, and Li Jingyao were appointed as compilers. In October of the 21st year, Huang Wenqi was added as the deputy chief compiler. In addition, Tai Shuangqiu, Luo Tingguang, Zhu Baoqin, Jin Zhaojun, Shen Zishan, Zheng Hesheng, Zhang Qiuxi, and Yang Kejing were specially invited as compilers by the Compilation and Examination Committee. This is a general overview of the assignment and invitation of colleagues in the first China Education Yearbook project.</p>
<p>The content of the compilation was initially drafted as a catalog by Chief Compiler Zhou Bangdao, and then the Compilation and Examination Committee made additions and deletions based on the opinions of various departments, and finally decided to divide it into five sections: Section A, General Overview of Education; Section B, Educational Laws and Regulations; Section C, General Situation of Education; Section D, Educational Statistics; and Section E, Educational Miscellany. Each section is further divided into several chapters and sections. The reason why it is called the first China Education Yearbook is that our country has never had a national education yearbook before. This compilation is indeed a pioneering effort. Except for the laws, regulations, general situation, and statistical facts, which are based on more recent materials, the rest mostly start from the late Qing Dynasty and end in the present. It is difficult to clearly delineate the years. Moreover, our country has a vast territory, inconvenient transportation, and policies are often hindered. It seems not easy to compile a volume annually in the shortest possible time to provide for the people of the country. It took some hesitation to adopt the term "first". However, to be accurate, it would be more accurate to call it "A Brief History of Modern Chinese Education, Volume 1."</p>
<p>The nature of education yearbooks published in Europe and the United States differs, including international, national, educational administrative organs, and academic research institutions. The formats vary, including reporting general situations, discussing issues, publishing monographs, presenting research results, and recording educational laws and regulations. The nature of this yearbook belongs to the national educational administrative organs, and its format focuses on reporting the general situation, supplemented by the recording of laws and regulations, and attached with the presentation of research results. As for the longitudinal narrative of educational facts, such as the sections on educational purposes, school systems, and educational administrative organization in Section A, the sections on general overview of higher education and general overview of secondary schools in Section C, and the sections on major events in education since the rise of education, the general situation of the publication of textbooks, and biographies of pioneers in education in Section E, each topic explores the origin and purpose, forming its own system, which can be said to be the original format of this yearbook.</p>
<p>The sources of materials for this yearbook can be roughly described as follows: First, the facts filled in by various educational administrative organs, consulates, schools, and academic research institutions and organizations according to the survey forms; second, the old and new archives of the Ministry; third, the publications of various educational administrative organs and academic research institutions and organizations; and fourth, the books and newspapers published by various associations and bureaus on educational facts. The first type is the most basic element. The various divisions formulate the matters to be submitted in all aspects and attach survey forms with outlines of the general situation, etc., and on May 3 of the 21st year, they issued an order, specifying the staff to fill in accurately item by item. Due to the staggered submission of reports from various provinces, the printing was delayed until the end of January this year.</p>
<p>The overall review of the manuscripts for this yearbook Section A and Section E were the responsibility of the former Compilation and Examination Department, special topics were written by specially invited compilers, Section B was the responsibility of the Counselor's Office, Section C's general overview of higher education, study abroad, and academic research institutions and organizations was the responsibility of the Higher Education Department, Section C's general overview of secondary education, elementary education, and overseas Chinese education was the responsibility of the General Education Department, Section C's general overview of Mongolian and Tibetan education was the responsibility of the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department, and Section D was the joint responsibility of various departments. The article on social sports in Section C was reviewed by Mr. Hao Shisheng and Mr. Wu Yunrui because it belonged to a specialized field. This was based on the principle of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding the drafting, receipt, and registration of yearbook documents, Zhou Gan of the Committee and the Secretariat initially handled them conveniently, and then the Compilation and Examination Committee designated Zhou Gan of the Committee and Zhou Bangdao, the chief compiler, to jointly be responsible, and specially set aside a collection of reference books and newspapers for the reference of the compilers. The secretaries were responsible for distributing the materials submitted and writing the completed manuscripts. Later, Chief Compiler Zhou had to go out to inspect schools due to his duties and could not be in the Ministry full-time, so all matters were presided over by Deputy Chief Compiler Huang Wenqi.</p>
<p>During the compilation process, colleagues talked about it afterwards and felt that there were many shortcomings. The main ones were: First, the reference years of various general situations were not consistent, and they could not be consistent due to the source relationship. Second, the materials sent by various parties were uneven, and the prescribed items for various general situations were often not fully prepared, and there was no basis for them, so there were many omissions. Third, the organization of the Compilation and Examination Committee and the establishment of the compilation were not very unified and coordinated, and there were practical inconveniences. Fourth, the members of the Compilation and Examination Committee and the compilers held concurrent positions, and they could only engage in this work when they had time after completing their own duties. Their spirits could not be focused, and efficiency was inevitably reduced. Fifth, the compilation staff were busy with official duties and had little time to gather and discuss, and the style and format, details and priorities were each determined by themselves. The facts are there, and there is no denying it. Sixth, only by not forgetting the past can we be a teacher for the future. The second and subsequent education yearbooks will be better than the first, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>Colleagues Zhong Shuyu, Wang Jiaxu, Fan Wenying, and Zhou Yunshang in the Ministry, whether checking files or collecting records, did not hesitate to be meticulous and provided a lot of assistance. Secretaries Yuan Rangguang, Yang Shiwei, Zhuan Ruomei, Xie Yulong, Shen Cheng, Tao Yuying, Wu Zengqi, Liu Yu, Zhang Guangxin, Sheng Xixi, He Xinhang, Duanmu Guangtao, and Lu Yanzi worked successively and tirelessly. Also, Zhang Aoshan proofread the entire book for punctuation and symbols. Recently, Chief Compiler Zhou had to travel to Henan and Shanxi, and Sun Shao伯 worked with Deputy Chief Compiler Huang to compile and proofread the book for printing, which was also laborious. All of these can be recorded.</p>
<h3 id="e218">The Case of the Qixia Monk and the Qixia Rural Teachers College is Not Yet Settled <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Before the 15th year, Qixia Temple was deserted. After that, the person in charge changed, the monk was good at socializing, and he carried out large-scale construction to make it焕然一新. Qixia Rural Normal School was established in front of the temple, and the monks and Confucians each went their own way, originally井水不犯河水. However, the temple believed that the surrounding area of the temple was large in ancient times because it checked the local chronicles, and that the location of the school and even the surrounding residential houses and fields belonged to the temple property in ancient times. Although there were reasons to use ancient laws to judge the present, it was difficult to prove the facts. Because of this view, local people and monks had opinions from time to time. The monk in charge of the temple did not come forward, but Monk Jiran (this monk is like a staff member in an institution, not a leader who negotiates with people. Lawsuits were filed, and the struggle was fiercest in the 17th year of the Republic of China. Huang Zhifu, the principal of Qixia Rural Teachers College, was sued by Jiran to the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Education, and the General Headquarters that year, but none of them were successful. Then he filed a lawsuit in the Jiangning Local Court, and appeared in court many times. The court ruled that Huang was not guilty and decided not to prosecute, and the Jiangsu Department of Education issued an order to inform Qixia Rural Teachers College. However, because Monk Jiran was fond of litigation and made false accusations, the local people filed a complaint with the Jiangning County Government and had a public order to expel Monk Jiran from the country and not allow him to stay in Qixia Temple again. Several years later, Monk Jiran recently sued Huang Zhi in the local court, but none of them were successful. Then he pointed out witnesses for the excavation of graves and filed a public prosecution with the court. In addition, there were many tourists to the famous Qixia Temple. The monks in the temple have always complained to the dignitaries of the temple. The dignitaries listened to one side of the story without careful investigation and were deceived by the monks. Some came forward to intercede. (In the 17th year, a certain Minister of Agriculture and Mining issued a letter to the Ministry of Education through the mountain after listening to the words of the monks during a temple tour, ordering the rural teachers to protect the ancient sites. Later, Principal Huang submitted a document explaining that a certain Minister understood. Recently, a certain member and two院長, etc., jointly sent a private letter to the provincial authorities. Although it has been explained, most of the dignitaries understand, but Huang Zhifu has been affected by the judgment.) It is heard that the Jiangning Local Court has sentenced Huang Zhifu to eight months in prison, and the education community feels injustice for Huang. In addition, due to the face of a certain dignitary, mediation is underway and reconciliation is in progress. Huang is still appealing according to law, but the order to go to Japan to study education has been carried out. It is heard that the Director of the Jiangsu Education Department has sent an official document to the High Court explaining that Huang has gone to Japan for study, which will last for three months. During these three months, please slow down the progress of this case.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Alumni Association of Zhonggong Graduates Appeals to the Nation for the Rejuvenation of the Alma Mater <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Painfully Recounting the Past Tragic History and Mission</p>
<p>Hoping that the Nation Will Respond with Justice and Material Assistance</p>
<p>Since the resignation of Principal Xiong Kewu from China Public School, school affairs have long lacked a person in charge. For the sake of maintaining the school and their own studies, the students of the school organized a petition group to request the school board, including Yu Youren, to select a principal and revitalize school affairs. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the Alumni Association of the school has specially issued an appeal to the nation yesterday for the rejuvenation of the alma mater. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Appeal to the Nation: Our Zhonggong was established to resist the oppression of Japanese imperialism, and it was also destroyed to resist the oppression of Japanese imperialism. Is the spirit of struggling against adversity only the glory of our students? Since the January 28th Incident, although there has been no shortage of people who care, there have been few who have inquired about its restoration, causing a school with nearly thirty years of glorious history to decline from here. Can we not feel pain? Our graduates cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the demise of our alma mater. Therefore, we will briefly describe the past history and mission of our China Public School to inform the nation:</p>
<p>Pioneer of Anti-Imperialism: 1. China Public School was the pioneer of anti-imperialism for the Chinese nation. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu, Chinese students studying in Japan returned to the country in anger and founded China Public School to oppose the newly promulgated regulations restricting students in Japan. It started the beginning of our Chinese people's establishment of universities. The meaning is profound, and the achievement is especially great. 2. At that time, except for the two or three schools run by churches in the country, there was only the Imperial University of Peking affiliated to the autocratic government. The feudal traditions were deep, and the supervision was especially strict. Party members could not stay. Therefore, although there were revolutionary plans, there was ultimately a lack of a venue for mobilization. Our Zhonggong arose in time, and party members such as Mr. Zhang Binglin, Dai Jitao, Yu Youren, and the late martyr Chen Yingshi, etc., were stationed there for a long time, laying the foundation for the revolution under the name of teaching. Hundreds of students were filled with revolutionary sentiments. Therefore, during the Guangzhou uprising in Xinhai, when the Premier left Shanghai, he landed at Wusong Dunhui and asked the alma mater for funds. The school authorities immediately assisted with a fund of 3 million to continue the revolution. After the establishment of the temporary government in the two capitals, the temporary Senate settled the Qingyuan Yin Tong's debts to the government. The China Public School Fund was reported below. Sun Yat-sen, Huang Kunqiang, and Mr. Song joined the board of directors. It can be seen that in those days our Zhonggong served the party with meritorious service, and that our party was mindful of Zhonggong.</p>
<p>Spirit of the Martyrs: 3. China Public School proclaimed for the party. Under autocratic rule, the people of the country regarded it as a monster, a bandit, and slandered it, causing trouble for the future of the school. The general manager, martyr Yao Hongye, Mr. Hongye, lamented the hesitation of the people of the country, resented the decline of the nation, and angrily committed suicide by jumping into the sea. His last words were thousands of words, dripping with beauty, saying, "My death is for the death of China Public School." Also, Mr. Zhang Bangjie, the director, died of exhaustion while supervising the school building. All of these two gentlemen sacrificed for Zhonggong. Therefore, the existence of Zhonggong for one day means that the spirit of the martyrs is not dead for one day.</p>
<p>Destroyed in a Flash: Alas, Zhonggong had the mission of anti-imperialism, possessed the glory of revolution, and was finally destroyed by violent Japan. Our government even ordered it to close within a limited time, which is what our students would like to hear, and what the people of the country would like to see. Yao, the martyr, said, "China Public School is a touchstone for the ability of the Chinese nation. If it cannot be established and developed, it is also a representative of the inferiority and defeat of the ability of our people." Students, people of the country, can we also be willing to be representatives of the inferiority and defeat of ability?</p>
<p>Plan for Rejuvenation: This association bears the trust of our graduates. At this time when the alma mater lacks a person in charge and is on the verge of life and death, how dare we remain silent? In addition to urging the board of directors to quickly plan for rejuvenation, select a principal with both talent and ability to preside over the school, and petition the government to withdraw the order to close within a limited time, in order to maintain our country's glory and the alma mater for the survival of the nation, we hereby say auspicious words, hoping that the nation will respond with justice and material assistance. Zhonggong is fortunate, Shenhua is fortunate.</p>

<p>Daxia Middle School, a fully-fledged middle school affiliated with Daxia University on Fanwangdu Road in Shanghai, currently has a total of twenty-four classes in senior and junior high school. Last semester, there were 698 male and female students. In order to increase teaching efficiency, it has been decided to build new school buildings, including one general office building, one Da Mou Hall, and four dormitories, all designed by Director Shi Ying of the High School Civil Engineering Department of the school. Tenders have been announced in newspapers, with completion expected before the fall of this year. The school has always been very serious about teaching and guidance. Last semester, seven students received awards for academic excellence, twenty-six students received scholarships for tool courses, and thirty students received scholarship certificates. Five students were expelled due to poor conduct, ten students were withdrawn, and five students were placed on probation. More than eighty students were held back due to poor graduation grades, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total number of students. Therefore, it is not easy to be promoted in the school without focusing on studying. During the winter vacation, famous banks in Shanghai, such as Zhejiang Graduation and Yanye, recruited employees, and graduates of this school were hired.</p>

<h3 id="e233">(V) Italian Vocational Education <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Since 1928, Italian vocational education has been uniformly managed by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education has established the Department of Arts and Crafts Education as a specialized agency, assisted by the Second and Third Subcommittees of the Supreme Education Committee. Each subcommittee is organized by seven members, with a total of fourteen members in the two groups. Part of the members are selected from scientists and technicians, and part are selected from agricultural, industrial, commercial, and nautical experts. The committee is composed of people from the two departments. In terms of supervision and guidance, the Ministry of Education relies entirely on the Royal Inspectors, the Local Arts and Crafts Education Committee, and the School Management Committee to cooperate in handling all affairs.</p>
<p>(1) Classification of Vocational Schools: Italian vocational schools can be divided into the following three categories: 1. Preparatory schools and preparatory classes for agriculture, industry, commerce, and navigation; 2. Vocational schools for agriculture, industry, commerce, and navigation; 3. Arts and crafts schools. In the earliest period, the academic level was very uneven, and the names were also different. After three decrees in 1928, 1929, and 1932, the teaching programs were unified and standardized. However, there is still no obstacle to the students' further education and the flexible development of each school due to special local conditions. There are now three types: three-year preparatory schools, and two-year and one-year preparatory schools. There are 486 royal secondary vocational preparatory schools, 255 two-year classes, and 409 one-year classes.</p>
<p>Agricultural Schools: Although agricultural education in Italy developed very early, the specific organization only began 45 years ago. At that time, the government began to establish practical agricultural schools and specialized agricultural schools, mostly established by local authorities and assisted by public groups. There are 27 practical agricultural schools and 7 specialized schools, with a secondary level of education, with a course of study from three to four years, mainly to cultivate the children of middle-level small-capital farmers. Among the specialized schools, four focus on grape cultivation and winemaking, one focuses on rural industries, one focuses on apples and horticulture, and one focuses on animal husbandry and cheesemaking. Although most schools can strive for progress with the changes of the times, agricultural science is developing extremely rapidly, such as new methods of cultivation, livestock improvement, selected planting and fertilization, the application of agricultural tools and machines, and the prevention and treatment of plant diseases and animal diseases. All of these require rich knowledge and a considerable scientific foundation to cope with. In order to remedy this, the Italian education authorities reorganized agricultural schools in 1923, with the following aspects as the entry point for rectification: (1) stipulating the scope of secondary agricultural schools, (2) increasing the level to meet the needs of agricultural engineering, (3) designating the specialties that each school should offer, and (4) expanding the budget of each school to meet new needs. The school level is also determined according to the level and the needs of each place, and there are the following levels of schools:</p>
<p>Royal Secondary Agricultural Schools: These are national schools, and the salaries of teachers and staff are borne by the government. However, the local and central governments share the daily maintenance costs equally. Each school has a farm for practice and experimentation. The internal administration is presided over by the school affairs management committee. Students admitted to the school must be between the ages of 13 and 17 and have completed four years of middle school. The course of study is three years for the general course. Those who are interested in further study may enter the fourth year of the specialized course, such as grape cultivation, apple cultivation, horticulture, cheesemaking, olive tree cultivation, oil production, winemaking, animal husbandry, and mountain forest economics.</p>
<p>Registered Secondary Agricultural Schools: There are not many of this type of school. So far, there are only two schools that have been registered and recognized as being equivalent to Royal Secondary Agricultural Schools.</p>
<p>Practical Agricultural Schools: There are currently eleven schools of this type. The course of study is three years. Only those who have graduated from elementary school can enter the school. The government provides an annual subsidy. The Roman Practical Agricultural Machinery School is known for its short-term training nature, specializing in teaching the application of rural machinery, and graduates in March.</p>
<p>Girls' Agricultural Schools: This type of school mainly teaches courses such as home economics and rural work. The government provides an annual subsidy.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Arts and Crafts Education <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Arts and crafts schools are places for training skilled workers in handicrafts and machine manufacturing. Schools are divided into three levels. The first level is worker schools, with a three-year course. The second level is apprentice schools, which train applied technology and manufacturing workers, with a three-year or four-year course. If there are special classes attached to train specialized technologies, they may be called senior arts and crafts schools. Apprentice training may also focus on one subject and shorten the training period to one year. This type of school is called factory schools. The third level school is the national arts and crafts school, which is of a higher level and is a place for training senior technical personnel in various industries.</p>
<p>Private arts and crafts schools that are recognized by the government are given a certain amount of subsidies annually. Girls' arts and crafts schools mainly focus on subjects such as clothing sewing and cooking.</p>
<p>At present, there are 11 national arts and crafts schools, 60 apprentice schools, 11 short-term specialized apprentice schools, 50 factory schools, 13 girls' arts and crafts schools, and 4 mining schools nationwide. The annual fee for national arts and crafts schools at all levels is 42.3 million Italian lire (1930-1931 budget), and the subsidies for private schools are not included.</p>

<p>Postponed for Three Years Without Being Held</p>
<p>Now Planned for Mid-May in Wuchang</p>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The Fifth Central China Games was originally scheduled to be held in Hankou in the 20th year of the Republic of China and was organized by the former Hankou Municipal Bureau of Education. Later, the meeting was moved by the Provincial Department of Education. A preparatory committee was established, and an organization budget book was drafted, including the meeting period expenses and the repair of public sports fields, with a planned cost of more than 177,700 yuan. It was submitted to the provincial government meeting for discussion and approval. At that time, due to the severe flood in the province, it was ordered to be postponed to the spring of the 21st year. Since then, although the Department of Education has repeatedly proposed holding the games, it has repeatedly ordered to reply due to the provincial treasury's shortage of funds. It was scheduled to be held in the spring of the 22nd year, but Li's headquarters ordered a temporary postponement. As a result, the meeting has been postponed for more than three years and has not yet been held. Xu Qibao, director of the Department of Education, believes that in order to develop national sports and increase interest in sports, it is necessary to unite the provinces of Central China to hold competitions. The meeting seems to be impossible to delay any longer. It was submitted to the Sports Committee of the Department for discussion on the 15th of this month. It was decided to hold the games in mid-May. According to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Constitution of the Central China Sports Federation, a preparatory office should be organized three months before each games and notify the provinces. Now that the time is pressing, a preparatory committee should be established immediately to plan everything. In terms of funding, in addition to the preparatory expenses, the repair of the sports field, the expenses during the meeting period, and the expenses for this province, the travel, board, and lodging expenses of the athletes and staff of other units, as well as other miscellaneous expenses, should be borne by the respective units to save money. As for the location, both Wuchang and Hankou are acceptable. However, Wuchang is the seat of the provincial government, with many schools and convenient participation for athletes. The original provincial public sports field has hosted the Third National Games and the Seventh National Football Regional Games. The scale is rough and repairs are easy. Both time and expenses are more economical. The above proposals were submitted to the Provincial Government Committee Meeting on the 10th. It was decided to approve the establishment of a preparatory committee, and the location of the games will be determined according to the equipment of the sports fields in Wuhan, with different types of events. The required expenses will be discussed by the Department of Education in a drafted budget.</p>

<p>Shanghai Basketball Group A Second Final</p>
<p>Mai Ling Wins Again with 45-32</p>
<p>Average Talent is Key to Mai Ling's Victory</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association Group A Championship has shifted this year from the Pirates to Mai Ling. In the second final last night, Mai Ling defeated the Pirates again, with a score of 45 to 32. From then on, the supremacy of maritime basketball was declared to have changed hands.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Fierce and Terrifying <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The intensity and ferocity of the game was terrifying. Both sides acted brutally, almost engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Although there were many fouls, the referee did not enforce the rules strictly enough. Some players almost resorted to violence, creating a tense atmosphere. One can imagine how fierce it was. The Chinese team is no match for them, and even the North China team may have difficulty winning. This shows how quickly Westerners' basketball skills are improving, while the Chinese are not making progress. This year's International Games may not be interesting to compete in.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Comparison of the Two Teams <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Mai Ling's victory was due to its strong and well-rounded team. The team's talent was evenly distributed. The six forwards were all equally good, and the guards were also solid. In the Pirates' team, since Si Lei was unable to attend due to injury, the defense was weakened. The substitutes were not up to par. Smith's weakness detracted from the team's performance, and the forwards also suffered a lot. Although Xiao Shiguiya and Bian Ersheng fought hard, they had to succumb to their opponents. On the other hand, Mai Ling's movements were exceptionally quick, and their shooting accuracy last night seemed as if the ball was connected to their heads.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Difficult to Separate <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the game, Tui Lu and Locke each missed a good opportunity to score. Rhein scored first, and Shi Guiya made a free throw. The Pirates took a 3-0 lead. Mai Ling did not show any weakness and followed closely behind, trailing by only one or two points. Eventually, with a goal by Luo Ai, Mai Ling took an 11-1 lead. Da Shiguiya made adjustments, and the Pirates regained the lead. Near the end of the first half, Mai Ling suddenly gained momentum and scored four consecutive points, taking a 22-20 lead for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Pirates Fall Miserably <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, the Pirates returned to the court with the same lineup as before. Mai Ling continued to press forward relentlessly, and their momentum was terrifying. The Pirates had difficulty developing their offense, and the situation became increasingly bleak. Mai Ling increased their lead from 26-20 to 30-23, leading by seven points. The Pirates' energy declined further, and their formation became disorganized. At 40-30, the outcome of the game was completely decided. The final score was 45-32, and Mai Ling won the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e249">The Art of Living <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zi</p>
<p>If this title were translated into classical Chinese, it would naturally be "Secrets to Getting Along in the World," but those four characters seem too old-fashioned. Writing them out would definitely not have any appeal. Therefore, the author has no choice but to imitate the old shop with a new opening method and use a different title.</p>
<p>Before discussing "The Art of Living," the author must first make an algebraic formula so that readers can understand it more clearly.</p>
<p>"The art of living is not general, but changes with the environment and time."</p>
<p>Therefore, the art of living we are discussing here is really just the art of living for a modern Chinese person. The applicable time may be ten years, maybe one year, or maybe just a few months. In short, when China's politics are on the right track and China's society stops being disturbed, the lives of all these arts of living can be declared over at the same time.</p>
<p>In the past, people didn't talk about the secrets of getting along in the world, but when they did talk about them, it was always about flattery and bragging. In fact, those things are no longer applicable. Now, only three characters are applicable: "ruthless," "clever," and "fast."</p>
<p>Ruthless In this world, although we cannot openly eat people raw or kill people casually, we cannot be too timid or too compassionate. As long as it is beneficial to yourself, you can ignore the lives and deaths of others and do whatever you want. If you feel that someone is hindering you, you should immediately take action to remove him and must eradicate him completely, so that he has no chance of revenge. In short, your gut must be as hard as possible, and you must not care about heaven, reason, or human feelings. Only then will you have food to eat!</p>
<p>Clever Flattery and bragging were originally the most brilliant art of being Chinese. Now, because there are too many people who can flatter and brag, they are no longer very effective. But if you can use your ingenuity and think of a clever way to flatter and brag, you can still exchange it for foreign money!</p>
<p>Fast This character is the most important. If you only have a "ruthless" gut and a "clever" mind, but you don't have "fast" means, you will definitely not be able to stand on your feet in China in these years. Even if you can stand on your feet, you still can't escape being bullied, scolded, and starving. Because now the entire society of China has become a world of grabbing food, and you must always talk about taking the initiative first. You must always keep the mentality of running a 100-meter race and compete with others. Then, even if you can't get much advantage, you will definitely not suffer too much!</p>
<h3 id="e250">Hobbies <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Limin</p>
<p>The term "hobby" refers to all aspects of a person's interests outside of their occupation.</p>
<p>There are many types of hobbies, such as drinking, playing cards, smoking, calligraphy and painting, watching movies, and collecting antiques. Chinese people often warn people to curb their hobbies, but I think there is much room for discussion.</p>
<p>People in this world really do not live for survival. We "cherish life and fear death." What we cherish is not life, but the various satisfactions and enjoyments that life gives us. What we fear is not death, but the deprivation of various satisfactions and enjoyments after death. Therefore, the more ways a person feels interested in the environment, or we can say the more hobbies they have, the richer and more meaningful their life will be, and the more unwilling they will be to abandon life.</p>
<p>Therefore, negative people, misanthropes, and suicidal people are probably interested in only one aspect and lack hobbies. Because they have no other hobbies besides their own job, no family joy, and no friendship with friends, and they do not feel interested in their own job, life is of course meaningless.</p>
<p>When a person is in love, life has meaning, and it is for the sake of their lover. Life and love become one and two, and two and one. Unfortunately, when they are lovelorn, life loses its meaning, they become misanthropic, and they commit suicide. That is the process that many young people who commit suicide because of lovelorn go through!</p>
<p>Therefore, if ordinary people are too focused on one aspect and completely abandon and isolate other aspects, they will be in danger of becoming negative, misanthropic, and suicidal when they are frustrated in the aspect they are pursuing.</p>
<p>From a psychological point of view, hobbies should not be curbed, but should be cultivated in many ways. Hobbies that are beneficial to the body and mind are worth promoting.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Warm Quilt <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The cold wind is freezing, and the climate is freezing. People abide by the ancient training of "working at sunrise and resting at sunset." In this winter, no matter how cold the climate is, they always have to get up and work, eat and drink, in order to seek a comfortable life for the day. Winter is the hibernation period for animals. Humans are endowed with active bodies and agile minds, and they cannot endure hunger and cold, so even in the icy and snowy environment, their hearts are still active, and their bodies are still stirring.</p>
<p>The winter wind cuts like a knife on people's bodies, and the winter climate surrounds people, with no warmth at all. After asking about the cold and working hard all day, people's only comfort is the warm quilt they wrap themselves in at night. Eight hours of work, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of sleep. The quilt is a warehouse where people store their bodies. In winter, people see the value of a warm quilt as a mysterious, warm, enjoyable, and memorable palace of pleasure.</p>
<p>The necessary items for the organization of a warm quilt are the quilt and mattress. According to the minds of knowledgeable humans, this minimum level of enjoyment can of course be enjoyed by everyone in the human living environment. But understanding is understanding, and facts are facts. On this winter night, the quilts of the rich are soft and warm, and the quilts of the poor are stiff and cold. Warm quilts are really a special product enjoyed by the rich. The bodies of the poor can only squat in ice-cellar-like burlap bags and paper tubes made of advertising paper.</p>
<p>The most enviable warm quilt is the young men and women, the newly married young couples. They wrap themselves in it, whispering sweet nothings and showing their affection for each other. They simply regard the warm quilt as a mysterious magic palace. But looking back at the flood victims along the Yellow River, in this winter, they have no cotton clothes to keep out the cold during the day and no cotton quilts to wrap themselves in at night. They are really unable to enjoy the warm quilt!</p>
<p>We are in this ice-cellar-like winter night. Frost is spread all over the ground, and the wind is shouting for people. Among our 400 million compatriots, are there more people sleeping in warm quilts or fewer people sleeping in warm quilts? I'm afraid there is no need to ask a statistician. We can guess it. Therefore, "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie frozen corpses." Wearing burlap bags and covering themselves with paper, those who freeze to death have short lives, and those with long lives can never die.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Proof of Kerosene Curing Lung Disease (Part 2) <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>I immediately refuted them one by one based on facts and reasons, saying, "Talking about the advantages and disadvantages of kerosene is entirely a matter of dosage. For example, morphine and aspirin, etc., will also cause danger if taken in excess. Kerosene is originally a safe and non-toxic substance, hundreds of times safer than spirits and liquor. There are many materials that can prove the safety of drinking kerosene in certain quantities from an academic and experimental perspective. If you think it violates morality, please point out the harm." That doctor dared not make any further defenses. This is a great shame for the medical community, calling himself a doctor but not knowing enough about kerosene. In short, kerosene is effective for all types of lung disease. However, why is it effective? Because kerosene contains special ingredients. The separation of these special ingredients will provide clinical experiments for medical researchers, and there should be a detailed explanation and publication. As for the method of drinking, according to my experience, try drinking 5 grams for the first time. After three or four days, drink it again. If diarrhea, vomiting, headache, fever, and other reactions occur after drinking, stop temporarily. If there are no side effects, increase the dose to 1.2 grams and drink it once every three or four days. The time to drink is on an empty stomach before going to bed. The maximum dose is 20 grams for early-stage patients, 15 grams for stage-one patients, and 7.5 grams for those with hemoptysis or stage-three patients. Pay close attention to the time of drinking and the number of days of separation. Ordinary small doses have the same properties as Chinese rhubarb and can be used as a stomachic. It is difficult to cause diarrhea or a rise in body temperature after drinking, but it is temporary, so don't worry about it. Drinking it will definitely increase appetite and make you feel refreshed. It is also okay to use it with other medicines. As for the type of kerosene, ordinary kerosene for lighting is fine. It is best to use oil with a slightly yellow color and 0.4% impurities. High-quality kerosene is not suitable for drinking.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 25 Tearful Farewell to Loved Ones, Hastening Home to Guard the Border, Wind and Sand Throughout the Night, Leaving the Village to Station in a Lonely City</p>
<p>"Oh God, let the light in, let the lover out." This folk song has been popular since ancient times and is so sad. But when it came to Yang Guizhi, it was not letting her lover out, but urging her husband, who had not been married for long, to go far away. It was not only sad, but simply miserable. So when Zhao Ziqiang said he was leaving, Guizhi grabbed Ziqiang's hand and couldn't speak for a long time. Ziqiang whispered, "Don't be sad. I'll write to you as soon as I get to the front. I'll find a house in a nearby village. Let's live there comfortably. What do you think?" Guizhi said, "That's naturally good, but this matter is not important. I hope you will be careful in everything." Ziqiang shook her hand, unable to say anything else. Just then, they heard the door of the opposite room creaking. Zhao Weng was already shouting in the living room, "Ziqiang, are you up?" Ziqiang immediately opened the door and came out to greet him, saying, "Dad, I'm up." Zhao Weng said, "I heard you two talking all night. Didn't you sleep?" Ziqiang said, "In that case, you probably didn't sleep either?" At the same time, there were messy footsteps in the yard. Jiang Shi said outside with a trembling voice, "Are you all up? Has Ziqiang's luggage been checked?" Guizhi quickly opened the door of the living room and said, "Mom didn't sleep all night either." Ziqiang smiled and bowed to Jiang Shi, saying, "The old lady also got up so early." Everyone was talking, standing in the living room, without knowing what to do, as if everyone had some kind of illness in their hearts, just panicking. Guizhi was still clearer-headed. First, she took Ziqiang's watch and put it in his pocket. Then, she put the checked suitcase and leather bag on the chair in the living room. (323)</p>

<p>The police chief of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, recently decided to strictly prohibit all local nightclubs until the nightclubs disappeared, because all cases have occurred in nightclubs throughout history. Nightclubs in Sweden have always been openly operating with a tax payment of five pounds per week, and huge profits are obtained, but these places are where criminals gather. The more nightclubs there are, the more cases of adultery, theft, and suicide occur. Therefore, in order to maintain urban tranquility, the Swedish police station decided to start with the capital and engage in cracking down on nightclubs.</p>

<p>In the United States, sleeping sickness has been very popular recently. The number of people suffering from this disease is increasing day by day. In St. Louis, Missouri alone, there are still hundreds of people suffering from sleeping sickness and still receiving treatment. Therefore, general physicians are warning society about the questions of how sleeping sickness occurs, how to treat it, and how to prevent it. The probable means of transmission of this sleeping sickness is the exhaust of cars, and African insects, livestock, and other species, because sleeping sickness originated in Africa, and now, the United States is paying close attention to African things, and all animals have been banned from importing.</p>

<h3 id="e261">The Philosophy of Mahjong <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhen</p>
<p>Aside from Mei Lanfang, mahjong is probably the only aspect of Chinese civilization that has been successfully promoted overseas.</p>
<p>Why is mahjong so popular? Because within these 136 tiles lies the philosophy of Chinese life. The three words "pong," "chow," and "hu" truly explain everything in our human world.</p>
<p>The most important thing when playing mahjong is to be able to pong pairs and chow sequences. Then, you are very likely to hu. Chinese life is the same: as long as you have good luck and seize opportunities skillfully, you can rise from a clerk to a chairman, from a stable boy to a military governor. If you win the lottery, not only can you easily gain fame and become a celebrity, but it will also be easy to become a chief or director of something. Therefore, the most important thing for the Chinese is destiny. Divination and astrology may be criticized as superstition, but they are still popular in society, revered by everyone from important party and state figures to cart drivers and coolies.</p>
<p>However, although we talk about destiny, human effort is also relevant. When luck is on your side, anyone can hu a pure hand with three doubles. But when luck is against you, even a skilled player can minimize their losses. Therefore, while believing in destiny, we also say that humans can conquer nature.</p>
<p>Moreover, in eight rounds of mahjong, winning and losing often fluctuate, creating a rollercoaster of emotions, making people happy and angry, forgetting everything. Throughout it all, people hold onto a hope: the hope that the winner can win even more, and the hope that the loser can break even. This is like people's attachment to life; no matter what, they are unwilling to give up their will to live and commit suicide until they are completely hopeless.</p>
<p>In a society where some people can enjoy the best living conditions with no skills, simply by chance, while others, despite their talents, live in poverty, the game of mahjong is undoubtedly a very apt representation. In reality, all social relationships are already fixed. The talk of fate or the idea that humans can conquer nature is nothing more than a way to eliminate the consciousness of struggle and maintain the stability of the existing society. Because if we talk about human conquest of nature, old and unreasonable systems can be broken by human effort. However, in mahjong, you can never escape the control of luck. So, although we talk about human effort, everything is still entirely dependent on fate.</p>
<p>Mahjong originated in China under the rule of the leisurely feudal class and became popular in the United States under the rule of the leisurely capitalist class in the 20th century. This has its reasons because the difference between China and the United States is merely that one is at the highest stage of feudal exploitation and the other is at the peak of capitalist exploitation.</p>
<h3 id="e262">A Tragic Comedy (Continued) <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>He proceeded according to his plan. In less than three months, almost every family in this small town had someone sick in bed. It could even be said that everyone in the town was ill. The only inn in the small town, which used to have very little business, now had no empty rooms. It was completely full of patients, and the inn had become a hospital.</p>
<p>Three months later, Dr. Palpare, who had previously given Croque this territory, came back to the small town to collect his debts. His surprise was extraordinary. But Croque dispelled his surprise with just a few words of explanation. Palpare understood the logic, but his conscience could not accept it. Thus, the author created the following dialogue:</p>
<p>Palpare: If I had your method, if I really had this method like you... if I had this ready-made method that I could just put into practice...</p>
<p>Croque: I understand.</p>
<p>Palpare: Wouldn't I feel any unease? (Silence) Please answer me.</p>
<p>Croque: But I think this is something you should answer yourself.</p>
<p>Palpare: You see, I'm not explaining anything. I'm only picking out the most euphemistic point.</p>
<p>(Silence)</p>
<p>Croque: I don't quite understand what you're saying.</p>
<p>Palpare: You'll definitely say I'm too strict, too meticulous. But in your method, isn't the patient's interest somewhat predicated on the doctor's interest?</p>
<p>Croque: Dr. Palpare, have you forgotten that there's an interest higher than both of these?</p>
<p>Palpare: What interest?</p>
<p>Croque: The interest of medicine. That's the only interest I'm dedicating myself to.</p>
<p>Next, Palpare asked him: "But you can't put the whole town in bed!" He wiped his hands and said, "There's still room for discussion on that. Because I've personally seen a family of five, all sick at the same time, all in bed, and they're coping very well..." From this, we can understand how sufficient this doctor's reasons are!</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will doubt whether this doctor is real, but to me, he couldn't be more real. The doctors we usually see are somewhat like this Mr. Croque. However, this Croque, who appears on stage, is too aware of himself. He analyzes all his actions clearly, while most doctors in the world are not so consciously aware. He can say out loud that he is for the "victory of medicine," while many doctors, although they believe and practice in the same way, don't even understand it themselves. Although Palpare can say, "Isn't the patient's interest somewhat predicated on the doctor's interest?" he hasn't actually been any different in practice. It's just that he doesn't have Croque's talent. Isn't that a good proof? He's immediately going to switch places with Croque, he's willing to give up his position in Lyon and come back to this small town.</p>
<p>The most crucial part of the whole play is in the dialogue quoted above. Both doctors' faces become serious, and the reader and audience can no longer laugh. It points out a truth that we usually overlook, and we remain helpless even when we understand this truth; at least until there is a fundamental change in this society, there is nothing we can do.</p>
<p>After reading this play, like after reading "The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich" or "The True Story of Ah Q," I was left with a heavy heart, more so than the power given by any tragedy. That's why I call this play a "Tragic Comedy."</p>
<h3 id="e263">Wine of Tears <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Rong</p>
<p>Yi Hong slightly opened her lips and poured a cup of wine straight down. It cut through her throat like a sharp knife, causing her to choke uncontrollably. The guests laughed, and the sisters laughed too. She felt her face burning, and her throat continued to sting.</p>
<p>"Another cup!" The fat man raised a full cup of wine and shouted. His face, pushing against the layers of fat, was as red as burning coal, glowing. He brought the wine straight to Yi Hong's lips, breathing heavily through his nose.</p>
<p>She hurriedly pushed it away, but he kept pushing it forward, saying, "You have to drink... you have to." Everyone clapped and shouted, some even leaving their seats and running over. Yi Hong looked at everyone with a mournful face. The guests were getting excited, and the sisters were watching on the sidelines with bitter smiles. She had lost all help, like a lamb in distress, almost wanting to cry.</p>
<p>The fat man also squinted, holding up the cup. Wine spilled from the cup, which trembled in his hand. "Drink, you can drink Lao Zhang's wine, you can drink mine too. Drink, you have to drink."</p>
<p>It felt like a fire was about to erupt in her heart. She wished she could punch those squinting eyes. But she turned her head and didn't move. She felt tears welling up in her eyes. But she immediately remembered what her madam had said, that she had to treat her smiles as her tears. So, she desperately held back. She felt dizzy and unsteady, and she sat down with a slump.</p>
<p>Someone came over and said nice things, but the fat man didn't agree. A large, rough hand covered in blue veins reached over and turned her face around, and the wine poured down her neck in an instant. She heard a clanging sound in her ear as the wine cup shattered on the ground.</p>
<p>She woke up as if from a dream, humiliation immediately biting at her heart. She jumped up, ignoring the cold wine that was pouring down her neck straight to her heart, and turned to leave. She felt her limbs trembling. But as she took a step, she was grabbed.</p>
<p>"Leaving? You have to drink even more. See where you can go."</p>
<p>The fat man was panting, holding her shoulder tightly with one hand, gripping it painfully. His eyes were bloodshot, like an angry beast. Yi Hong felt like her whole body was on fire, and she forgot everything. She raised her hand and struck the fat arm hard, and the fat man's hand tightened, then suddenly laughed.</p>
<p>"Good, you hit well." He shouted, raising his other hand high, a huge, rock-like fist suspended in the air. The guests and sisters crowded around. Immediately, countless hands reached out, pulling and tugging. Yi Hong seized the opportunity to break free, and four greyish-white finger marks were clearly visible on her bare arm.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chaos, Yi Hong was dragged down the stairs. She heard the sound of broken bowls and dishes upstairs. She got into a rickshaw and fled into the brightly lit streets. She felt dazed and confused, not knowing what she had done tonight. Tears fell from her face like broken beads, and she forgot everything. She still had the wine stain from just now on her cheek...</p>
<h3 id="e264">Random Notes on Returning Home <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>Before returning home, I passed through Nanjing and took the Nanjing-Wuhu long-distance bus. Buying the ticket and getting on the bus were both disorderly and crowded. From the company's perspective, this shows that public institutions are not handling things well, selling as many tickets as possible without considering the congestion after passengers get on the bus. Some people even swayed for several hours without a seat, and their backs couldn't straighten when they stood. On the way, I saw children throwing stones at the bus. The bus had to cross the river by ferry, which was time-consuming and laborious.</p>
<p>I took a walk on the streets of Wuhu and saw many people who didn't look like beggars but were wearing clothes that weren't too tattered, who had come from the countryside to the city to escape the famine and beg for food. I heard the workers on the road saying, "Things in the countryside are really terrible, getting worse every year."</p>
<p>There was a small steamboat from Wuhu to Chaoxian, and I happened to encounter "shared trips." A single trip ticket cost four dimes, while a shared trip ticket cost two dimes. The ticket price was the same regardless of the length of the journey. When there were no "shared trips," the customs on this route were considered among the worst of the small inland river steamboat routes on the Yangtze River. The "connecting river" phenomenon of monopolizing cabin space and the company's free pricing both inconvenienced passengers. Everything seemed disorderly and unregulated. To see more, I also sat in the large passenger cabin. I heard many passengers say, "A person who never leaves home is a noble person." The inconveniences experienced by passengers on the Yangtze River where boats travel can be seen here. Of course, there was also the "pushing and shoving" phenomenon on the large Yangtze River steamboats. There were quite a few opium smokers on the boat. The true "masses" in the cabin talked about stories from heroic chivalry tales. They probably wouldn't read new literature for another twenty or thirty years. This is a matter of fact, unrelated to pleasant theories.</p>
<p>I stayed in a lodging house (i.e., a hotel) in Chaoxian for three dimes a day, and there was also a meal of ten dishes, which was really cheap and good. But the market conditions were more than twice as desolate as they were eleven years ago. After another hour by bus, I arrived home. Both the bus and the road were bad. The road passed over a small mountain top, and it was said that the reimbursement for opening this mountain top was 100,000, but in reality, the cost was limited, and the entire route was built by farmers contributing labor, without receiving a penny in wages, similar to the new style of "agricultural corvée" when building the Great Wall. How the reimbursement was done is difficult to know for sure. This is also one reason why people want to become officials.</p>
<p>At home, I had the opportunity to contact various people and review the situation in the interior, seeing the reality of people's lives in a broken-down rural area. They have no education; nineteen out of twenty are illiterate. They have no money; nineteen out of twenty are in debt. They want to celebrate the Lunar New Year. I vaguely know why it's difficult for them to improve their lives and why the so-called lords above want to exploit them. Some people have great difficulty borrowing a dollar to buy rice for the New Year's Eve dinner, and it's hard to sell a rooster on the street to get money for the New Year. Some have to travel hundreds of miles to Wuhu to pawn things (pawnshops in small cities don't open, for many reasons), but some are unfortunate enough to encounter bandits on the way, and these bandits all have modern weapons. Yet, they want to celebrate the New Year, burn incense and paper money, smoke cigarettes, light kerosene lamps, and eat foreign sugar. Looking at the commercial situation in one district of one county alone, kerosene and cigarette stores can earn more than 50,000 yuan a year, but the real earners are not Chinese, and the consumers are mostly farmers. Local products are worthless, rice doesn't sell for four yuan a picul, and peanuts sell for two or three yuan a picul. How can farmers live like this! Looking at a small town with a population of just over 10,000, there are 200 opium dens, full every night. Various shops have little business in the twelfth lunar month, but opium dens are as prosperous as ever. Therefore, ordinary people see the importance of black rice (opium) as no less than that of white rice (food). In ordinary families, offering opium is the same as offering cigarettes, a matter of social etiquette; otherwise, it is disrespectful and loses face. There are signs on the thoroughfares saying that those who grow opium will be executed, but there are formal "soil shops" (opium dens) in the area.</p>
<p>I went to Hefei once. The situation in this area is similar. The countryside is declining, and everyone is struggling, but the emaciated farmers have to carry the fat lords and watch them play all kinds of civil and military tricks. Many village women and children are born strong and intelligent, but like the men, they have no education and will all become illiterate. Even uneducated, local corrupt officials who haven't read foreign books can control these ignorant poor people very well. I dare not expect any hope for this society. In the interior, people celebrate the Lunar New Year, paste door couplets, and set off firecrackers. The result of the New Year is the addition of many bankrupt large and small shops and countless unemployed shop assistants and workers. The countryside cannot accommodate them, and the cities cannot accommodate them either. The nice talk is "immigration," but it is not known if there is really any place to move to. They also cannot take turns going on stage to collect some money and live their lives, so everywhere they cry out in poverty.</p>

<h3 id="e266">Financial Gold and Silver Prices Continue to Fall, the Tiao Jin Price Rises Again by Six Yuan <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>丨Guang Bang Forcefully Purchases More Than a Thousand Bars丨</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise yesterday, but it was difficult to break through the 50 yuan mark. The overall situation throughout the day remained hovering. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US fell, with the gold and silver exchange's forward silver price dropping by four to five-point-sevens. The exchange rate rose slightly. London raw gold shrank by one penny, US cotton fell 0.21 pounds, and US wheat fell by 1.125 cents. The raw gold opening price rose to over 47 yuan, with very slight fluctuations and a stable situation. Guang Bang's raw gold also saw some purchases. After the opening, the situation was uncertain and struggling. As soon as it was learned that the HSBC bank's exchange rate listings for both the UK and the US had not changed, and the exchange rate loosened, it fell to the lower range. Later, as prices took advantage of the cheap price to make up for the shortfall, it began to hover. Finally, with major bullish investors adding to their positions, the domestic market improved. Reuters reported that the Secretary of the Ministry of Industry of our country told a Reuters reporter that Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo was urgently trying to resolve the silver issue. Although it had little impact, people's hearts were briefly agitated, and the gold market turned bullish. However, it was difficult to sustain in the later market. Major investors sold off, and the situation declined. Finally, it was heard that US merchants in Shanghai had cabled the US President, requesting that the silver price be raised domestically rather than implemented abroad, and it stabilized slightly. The three-month futures continued to rise. Checking the day's market situation, there were no specific changes. In our country, the rumor that silver taxes would be increased and exports prohibited before the silver agreement was suddenly rife. There were many more favorable rumors in the market, but in reality, it was feared that it would have little impact. The price of pure gold was 957.5 yuan. The day's market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 947.3 yuan, a further increase of 5.7 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 7.2 yuan. When the exchange rate opened, the near-term selling price was one shilling and four pence and four-three-seven-five for British currency, and 34.8125 yuan for US currency. Although raw gold came in, Dachangxiang, Zhifeng, Yongrui, Kangshun, and Maocheng were all selling. Pangen plugged the June US dollar at 35.25 yuan, and Citibank plugged the March US dollar at 34.75, falling to 6.6 yuan. Mitsui pulled the June US dollar at 25, and Yuanheng, Hengxing, Shengda, and Fuyu entered at 7.8 yuan. Soon, the June US dollar at 25 was difficult to sell. HSBC's listing did not change, and Zhifeng, Yongde, Kang Yifeng, and Yong sold off, falling to within 6 yuan. Dadecheng and Hengyu also sold to 5.6 yuan. Macgary ate the June US dollar at 3125. Hengxing and Hengxing Yuanyicheng entered, rising to 6.5 yuan. It hovered around 6 yuan for quite some time. Then, Mitsui ate the June US dollar at 3125 again, and Qianchangxiang, Yuanchun, Yongfeng, Daxing, Yongda, and Decheng competed to purchase, and news came that it rose to 8.5 yuan. Although Hengchang Yong sold, Hengtai, Richang, Yuanmao, Yongxie Xingyong, and others entered again. The afternoon close rose to 949.2 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 8.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 947.8 yuan, and goods opened at 7.9 yuan. Mitsui pulled the June US dollar at 1875. The market was stable at the opening, but then, due to Dekang and Yuanmao Yong supplying, it retreated to 7.5 yuan. Zhengjin pulled the June US dollar at 1875. Hengxing Shengda entered at 8.2 yuan. Yuanmao Yongruixing sold off and declined. Yuanfeng Yong purchased, and it was still stable at this time. Later, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Xiexing Yong, and others sold off fiercely, falling to 6.2 yuan. The bank forcefully pulled the June US dollar at 25, and the situation stabilized again. Yidayong and Hengxing Lai entered, rising to 8 yuan again. Hengxing suddenly came to sell off, and the close fell to 947.8 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 7.6 yuan. Checking the day's high was 949.6 yuan, and the low was 945.2 yuan, a difference of four yuan. As a result, it continued to rise by 6.2 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price was that HSBC's US dollar listing had not moved, remaining at 34.375 yuan, and the combined Tiao Jin price was over 1006 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 59 yuan weak, a decrease of 6 yuan compared to the previous close. The three-month period remained at 711 yuan as the shilling did not move. According to the closing price, it was about 5 yuan weak. The logbook for this month was 716 yuan, 706 yuan for March, and 949 yuan for April. The water compensation was 716 yuan in the morning, and the same price in the afternoon. The price of pure gold was calculated at 957.5 yuan. Formal transactions in the market ranged from 958.5 yuan to 959 yuan, sold by the Tianjin Bang to Yingfeng, Hengtong, Fengyong, Dada, and Decheng, totaling about 3,000 taels. The current month's Tiao Zi still totaled 6,433 strips.</p>
<p>Trading in the market remained calm. Overall, Shengda, Hengxing, Fuyu, Yuanchun, Yicheng, Zhifeng, Yongxie Xingyong, Yuanmao Yongda, Kang Hengxing Yuan, and others were on the buying side. Hengyu, Dadecheng, Hengtai Yuanmao, Ruikang, Zhentai Ruixing, Dekang Shunmao, and others were on the selling side. Hengchang Yongfuchang and Yifeng Yongdaxingyong entered and exited first. Qianchangxiang Yicheng Xiexingyong Changsheng Yong entered and then exited again. Dalian Bang Wanxing did more than 700 strips in total, with a small number squeezed out. Shunli did more than 300 strips in total, with slightly less than 100 strips squeezed out. Guang Bang Shengda entered a total of 1,4500 strips, and Hengxing entered more than 300 strips, exiting a small number. The April futures bargaining chip totaled 14,035 strips, with a total of 32 bulls and 54 bears. The total number of transactions that day was 27,825 strips in the morning and 10,535 strips in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The three-month opening was 705.5 yuan, an increase of 2.9 yuan compared to the previous close. This price was sold by Dakang for only 14 strips, and Xin Chang wanted it immediately but did not get it. After entering, Cuitai sold 28 strips to Fuyu for 5.8 yuan, and Zhifeng Yong came up to sell off, selling 28 strips to Richang for 5.5 yuan. Then, as Zhifeng Yong and others continued to sell, the April futures had already fallen, so it gradually fell to 4.5 yuan. Finally, the supply side suddenly became quiet, and it returned to good. Richang sold to Zhaofeng Chang, which had risen to 6 yuan. The afternoon close was 706 yuan. The afternoon market opened at 706.3 yuan. At this price, after Zhifeng Yong sold 42 strips to Hengyu, Hengyu made up 6.5 yuan. Fuyu sold to Yuansheng Yong has 6.6 yuan, Hengyu suddenly came to sell off, Yidayong also sold, and the closing fell to 706.2 yuan. Checking the day's high was 706.6 yuan, and the low was 704.5 yuan, a difference of 2.1 yuan. As a result, it rose again by 3.6 yuan compared to the previous close. The three-month futures bargaining chip totaled 21,525 strips that day.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Erratic Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Resulted in a Tightening of British and American Currencies 1.875 and 3.75 <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>

Compared to the previous closing prices, British currency tightened by 0.0125 and American currency tightened by 0.03125. The market situation hardened after the opening, and the process was erratic. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) quotation revealed that both British and American currencies remained level. Subsequently, the underlying trend was unfavorable, but banks supported the prices by buying on the cheap. Conditions improved slightly at noon due to marginally favorable news, but the market showed signs of softening afterward, as Chinese merchants appeared to be liquidating holdings. Banks bought back positions to fill gaps, and the process tended to harden.

<p>|Foreign Call Loans Still Offered at Interest-Free Rate|</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the banking and money shop sectors were still quiet and indifferent towards the foreign exchange situation, the demand from various commercial sectors gradually started to grow, resulting in an overall thriving atmosphere. Foreign call loans were still being offered at the interest-free rate in the market, primarily because of excessive overnight funds, resulting in continuous weakness. Overnight clearings at the Small Bankers' Association were done at the interest-free rate. The volume of transactions in call loan notes was over 2 million in the early morning and over 300,000 in new transactions. Transactions at the Small Bankers' Association totaled over 500,000. Foreign mortgage loan transactions involved redeeming 300,000 to 400,000 and making 500,000 in new loans. Over 1.1 million in banknotes were collected and issued. Customer traffic was approximately 400,000. Bank receipts and payments: foreign banks received and paid over 1.2 million in bills, over 3 million in various goods, foreign exchange mortgages, and miscellaneous receipts and payments, and over 1.2 million in settlement receipts and payments, with 200,000 going into storage. Chinese banks received and paid over 2.5 million in bills, over 3.5 to 3.6 million in various goods, foreign exchange mortgage taxes, and miscellaneous receipts and payments, and over 1.3 million in settlement receipts and payments, with 400,000 going out of storage.

Money shops received and paid over 24 million in foreign public receipts and payments and over 2.5 million in foreign overnight clearing receipts and payments, with over 400,000 in various foreign exchange receipts and payments and 200,000 to 300,000 in cash receipts. Furthermore, the total amount exchanged at the city's bill exchange house on the 27th was 8,288,484.70 silver dollars, including 4,925,297.40 silver dollars in silver and 3,363,187.30 silver dollars in exchange drafts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins continued to increase by five yuan to 855 yuan, a significant increase of ten yuan compared to last Sunday. Transactions totaling 14,500 yuan were made. It is rumored that someone inland wanted to purchase 70,000 to 80,000 jiao, causing the market price to suddenly rise. Guangjiao [silver coins], on the other hand, were stable at 773 yuan, but still up three yuan from the previous day, with 35,000 jiao transacted. Copper coins contracted by 500 cash to 318,500 cash, with over 38,200 strings transacted, representing a value of 12,000 foreign yuan.

<p>Restoration of Four Sessions of Trading Per Day</p>
<p>Various Bonds First Rose Then Showed Discrepancies</p>
<p>Prices Have Reached a Peak, Both Bulls and Bears are Cautious</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange began trading April futures and restored the four sessions of trading per day, both morning and afternoon. Due to the two-day market closure for the weekend and settlement, the environment was favorable. The Sun Chuanfang disturbance had been resolved, and the issue of rising silver prices was not expected to have any immediate impact. Speculators covering short positions and large investors buying caused market prices to rise again, reaching a peak. Market sentiment was excellent, with a tendency to discover new high prices. At the opening in the morning, short positions in the Thirteenth issue were covered, and there was considerable buying in the Fifth issue. Buying also exceeded selling in the Fifteenth issue. In general, retail buying was also strong, but the Northern group sold slightly, causing market prices to uniformly increase by one or two jiao to about four jiao. In the second session, buyers continued to surge in, and the trading floor was extremely tight, with prices rising another three to five jiao. Almost all the losses from the previous Saturday had been recovered. Investor confidence was strong, and market sentiment was good. In the two afternoon sessions, the market became slightly chaotic, with prices fluctuating up and down, and the range of price changes being small, generally between one and three jiao. In general, however, there were more rises than falls, and the trend may temporarily stabilize and then move upward. The final results for the day showed that prices rose between one or two jiao and about one yuan, with the 1920 Customs Bonds and Salt Tax Bonds showing the largest increases of nine jiao and nine and a half jiao, respectively. Although the April futures were opening for the first day, only the 1918 Customs and Gold Long-Term Bonds did not open for trading. The rest opened across the board, and prices were also good. The total number of transactions was 14,150,000 yuan. There were no spot transactions. A comparison of the high, low, rise, and fall of prices is listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>A New Fook Hong &amp; Co. report on the 26th stated that the New York stock market fell due to fears of a strike at Toledo Power Automotive Parts, which threatened to disrupt the entire automotive industry. Automotive stocks were heavily sold off, and market conditions fell by a small number of jiao to three yuan. Transportation stocks followed the crowd and fell. Roosevelt's message had no impact. There was a heavy snowstorm in New York today, and there were few people in the exchange. Power lines were broken by the wind, and transportation was disrupted, so it is predicted that even fewer people will arrive the next day. Bonds were also weak. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 2.19 million. (Wheat) Continued rain in the Southwest indicates that the supply is gradually decreasing. It is difficult for market conditions to rise temporarily. (Cotton) The limits of the Punk Hae case have been increased from 9 million to 10 million bales, and the application form has also changed. At the same time, some people suspect the legal effect of this case after it is passed. Those who support strict restrictions are quite disappointed and are subsequently selling off. Buyers are not strong, and the spot market is quiet. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e273">### Yarn and Cotton Settlement Day: Spot Yarn and Cotton are Quiet and Weak. Spot Yarn Sales are Minimal. <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak. Overseas cotton markets have shown signs of decline, causing increased investor weariness, with many adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Most discussions mention that while Shenxin factories are receiving goods, certain factories are also delivering Jin Cheng yarns, further softening the market. However, current cost calculations show that factories are already operating at a loss. If market prices fall further, factories will face even greater difficulties. Furthermore, yarn prices are already at a low level; comparing to third-grade yarns, prices are not particularly high. Overall, actual demand is too sluggish, and the pressure on the yarn market remains heavy. Spot yarn sales by traders are weak. It is noted that only 128 bales were transacted in the first half of the day, with prices falling by five jiao. The volume of transactions in the afternoon will be calculated tomorrow. The buying volume of each trader is as follows:</p>

<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange is experiencing heated disputes between both parties regarding the issue of changing auction yarn standards. According to yesterday's news, Jinji yarn may be auctioned on March 1. The previously agreed discount of seven yuan for ordinary products from a certain factory has now been slightly modified to a discount of four yuan. However, according to another report, mediation is still needed, and it is difficult to determine whether an auction can occur.</p>
<h3 id="e276">### Only 9,200 Bales of February Auction Yarn Were Delivered <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>|The Price was 181 Yuan|</p>
<p>February auction yarn was launched on September 1 of last year, with an opening price of 187 yuan and three jiao. Subsequently, due to the slump in the U.S. cotton market, the decline in China's rural economy, and the sluggish sales of spot yarn, the market gradually trended weak. Then, on October 16, the National Economic Commission established the Cotton Industry Control Association, which implemented plans to maintain yarn prices. Market prices saw a slight increase, until changes occurred in the Fujian-Zhejiang military situation in November, and a certain factory was unwilling to take delivery, causing prices to fall again. In mid-December, the lowest price was seen outside of 172 yuan, before negotiations between India and Japan on the cotton industry were successfully concluded at the beginning of this year. Indian cotton rose sharply, and cotton prices followed suit. The Shenxin factory, seeing the rising cost of raw materials, became increasingly difficult and firmly maintained yarn prices, buying heavily in the auction yarn market. The market suddenly rose sharply, extending to the last session of the month at 181 yuan and five jiao, an increase of 11.5 yuan compared to the previous month's price. As a result, 9,200 bales remained, and it was reported that Yong'an delivered 2,800 bales of Jin Cheng yarn, 2,000 bales of 20s Fuguai yarn, 50 bales of 20s Zhinu, and 50 bales of Tianguan. The Shenxin factory exclusively received all deliveries, and the settlement price was 181 yuan. The bale volume of both the selling and delivery parties is listed below:</p>

<p>Quantity: 31,300 Bales</p>
<p>Price: 42 Yuan 5 Jiao</p>
<p>February Zheng Biao was launched on September 1 of last year, with an opening price of 40 yuan, 6 jiao and a half. After a small increase to one yuan outside, U.S. cotton production was abundant, and prices trended downward. At the same time, the yarn market discovered a new low, making it even more difficult for the cotton market to stabilize. The lowest price broke through the 40-yuan mark. Although there were various sources of cotton, the moisture content was too high to meet delivery standards, and the market saw a rebound. However, with low prices for Indian cotton and a lack of demand for Chinese cotton, the market trended downward again. Then, at the end of the year, India and Japan Cotton Industry reached an agreement and signed the contract successfully. Indian cotton first rose sharply, and U.S. cotton's acreage reduction campaign was intense, creating tension. The market also rose, from a jiao, 0.00035, to one jiao and 0.00265. Speculators in the auction cotton market actively bought the May contract, with the highest price reaching 45 yuan, 1 jiao. Extending into the middle of this month, silver prices increased, making the assessed price cheaper. The market trended downward, with the lowest price seen at 42 yuan, 2 jiao and a half. Later, after a certain manufacturer received goods, it rose to 2 yuan, 9 jiao and a half. As a result, 31,300 dan remained. The goods were mostly Taicang Fire Machine cotton, white bags. The receiving factories were Yong'an Factory, Shenxin Factory, and Dafeng Factory, among others. The settlement price was 42 yuan, 5 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton market conditions declined due to unfavorable reports from Liverpool, weakness on Wall Street, and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, spot prices fell by 30 basis points and futures prices fell by 21 to 26 basis points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 10 to 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 9 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by speculators. As a result, Pingjar fell by 5 rupees and 2.5 annas, Olmrah fell by 5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 4.5 rupees. The original telegram records are listed below (dated the 26th):</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, market conditions for all months generally presented a sluggish and listless appearance. Quotations for foreign wheat, Chicago were down by a small three or four jiao, and Canadian were down by a small eight fen or so. Therefore, at the time of opening, near-term market sentiment was seen to be flat. The opening price was as low as 2.065 yuan, down by more than one fen from the previous day. March through June were also seen to be weak at the same time, while July remained stable. When the afternoon session opened, only half a day of trading was left for this month. Initially, conditions were still flat and weak, but then a general short covering gradually compensated. Fuxin chips were also being withdrawn. Therefore, the opening price rose step by step, and distant-month contracts were also slightly rebound as various factories stopped and outside investors made slight inroads. This situation is still a small rebound from a large decline, and the future still holds little hope. With the tracking activity of spot foreign wheat, domestic real sales are also difficult to achieve smoothly. It is feared that it will remain weak and spiritless afterward. As a result, this month rebounded by one fen compared to the previous day, March rebounded by 1.25 fen, April rebounded by 1.75 fen, June rebounded by 1.5 fen, and July rebounded by 1.75 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e280">### 18 Cars of Futures Wheat Were Delivered <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery of February futures wheat, and the futures market was closed. The total quantity delivered throughout the day was 18 cars, delivered by Runde and Zhicheng, two companies, and received by traders on behalf of the buyer. The entire quantity was received by Huafeng Factory. Regarding market conditions thereafter, industry insiders speculated that as foreign wheat is gradually shipped, factories can produce without worry, and although domestic wheat is scarce, it does not seem to be a problem. Deliveries of other miscellaneous grains included 5 cars of standard soybeans, 4,000 pieces of bean cake, and 200 dan of bean oil.</p>
<h3 id="e281">### Ke Xian Rice Sales are Turning Active in Local Markets <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market saw a slowdown in Min-Yue [Fujian-Guangdong] dealings, but sales were concentrated on local streets. The flow of goods in transit was not large, and the market stabilized. Sales opened at 3,200 bags of Ke Xian at various stalls, with prices not differing significantly from the previous day. However, due to slight differences in the quality of the goods, the selling prices also varied. Yesterday, Ke Hua was only inquired about by the Fuzhou group. Other groups were all in wait-and-see mode. The Fuzhou group purchased 1,400 to 1,500 bags, and the rest were all taken in by local streets. In addition to receiving machine-milled Ke Xian at a price of Ke Yuan, local streets also received 200 bags of re-inflowed small-grain rice at a price of 6.85 yuan, the same price as the previous transaction. There were no orders for foreign rice, which has been in short supply for a long time, and only inventory remains. Because foreign merchants are unwilling to let go of the product easily because of high costs, the rice market is temporarily supported and must await inquiries from major groups after the Lantern Festival before it can turn for the better. However, it is said that once sales are strong and market prices rise, rice will be transported from the production areas to Shanghai, so it will not be easy to have a very good market afterward.</p>
<h3 id="e282">### Rice Prices are Still Difficult to Improve <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of goods were slightly scarce for all groups, totaling nearly 30 numbers (over 4,000 shi). Sales of late rice were still smooth, but there was still a large amount of leftover goods. For example, the Nanbei Yang group imported nearly 3,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian late rice, and prices were lower by two or three fen. The market in local stores was still weak, and the market situation still showed signs of sluggishness. The price of Chang bang Su Tong Nan Gang, etc., was about the same, with no major changes. Du Yang Jian's price saw neither gain nor loss, as supply and demand were similar. There was also not much difference in Yin Bian Yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 32 to 33 numbers of goods arrived from Hexia. Sales of various colors on the market were slightly lower in price. The prices of Bai Geng Yang Jian [rice type] were weak by nearly a jiao. The prices of early thin-skinned rice Bai Yuan Yin Yuan Du Bu Ke Jian [rice type] were flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e283">### Soybean Factory Demand Continues, but the Market Turns Soft <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>The soybean market situation. The day before yesterday, the market stabilized as factory demand increased. Yesterday, although there was factory demand, goods sellers feared that it would not be easy to sell at high prices, so many sold at current prices. The market was flat and soft. The total number of transactions throughout the day was also 14 or 15 cars. The destinations were Fuzhou, Xiamen, local inland factories, etc., with Kai Zhengyangguan soybeans at 2.8 yuan, Feihe soybeans at 2.74 to 2.764 yuan, Yingzhou soybeans at 2.59 to 2.553 yuan, Bengbu soybeans at 2.42 yuan, and Linhuai soybeans at 2.4 yuan. Xikou was 2.553 yuan. All others, Du soybeans were stable, and Sha Huang was flat and weak. The sales by the promotion group and local streets were the largest.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market improved due to the rise in customs gold. The association quoted prices such as 19.75 yuan for 24 crude sand white sugar and 6.7 yuan for transshipment goods, both up by 5 fen. No. 9 Hechi was 15.9 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 20.02 yuan, CW mark was 19.95 yuan, DY mark was 19.75 yuan, and HX mark was 19.45 yuan, all of which had transactions. More than 300 bags of Chaoqing sugar were released yesterday from the Yangsui and Hesheng rounds, with prices such as 11.12 yuan for Chong Huanggang, 10.07 yuan for half Nanqing, and 10.065 yuan for Longjiangqing, up by about a jiao from before.</p>

<p>Due to the long absence and initial arrival of Xiamen dried longans, with only four pieces, the supply was insufficient to meet demand. The market situation was firm and strong. It was heard that trading had already begun yesterday, with the price at 72 yuan, up by more than 6 yuan compared to before the holiday. If the subsequent goods continue to be scarce, it is feared that they will continue to rise.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the British steel plate market suddenly changed its old outlook. The depressed market suddenly developed as various groups from Sichuan and Dalian were adding to their purchases. Transactions were booming. The price of 2.5 mm was estimated at 8.6 yuan, and 0.5 mm was 7 yuan. 7.5 mm and 1 mm were all estimated at 6.85 yuan, not much progress compared to before, but they were much more rigid. It was heard that the bottom goods were thin, and investor confidence was even better, so the outlook for sales was even more optimistic.</p>

<p>European and American silk and tea factories are currently weaving spring silk fabrics. The sales of raw silk are relatively strong, and the stock of silk is gradually thinning. Japanese silk is being devalued and dumped, and progress is being made significantly, causing current silk market prices to continue to trend flat and weak. Real sales of Chinese silk are still unmoved. Various European firms in Shanghai only take the opportunity to cover positions cheaply, and the future is pessimistic. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others imported 30 packages of Huang Bai silk factory goods, and prices were still flat and weak.</p>

<h3 id="e308">The Tide of Suicides Among Young Women <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Suicide among young women, which was once sporadic, has gradually become more frequent and widespread. Around the New Year's Day on the lunar calendar, it almost reached its peak. It is unknown how many troubled and distressed young women are about to embark on this path of "great rest" to seek great liberation from life. If we do not casually regard this fact as a "minor matter" for "water-cooler talk," we will notice its severity. This is undeniable: suicide among young women is no longer an accidental event to be excited about; it has, in fact, become a widespread phenomenon that numbs the mind. However, it is a trend that cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Even when the early spring festival drums were urging the Lunar New Year, there was the student Hu Zhen, who committed suicide because she was not admitted to the school she applied to, and the teacher Huang Shan, who harbored "pessimism" because his salary was in arrears and he was insulted and dismissed. During this joyous Spring Festival, when every family was raising their cups and drinking longevity wine, it was even more a time to "start anew with the year," and the situation intensified. First, there was the film star Ai Xia, who gained great fame in society for starring in "A Modern Woman," who took her own life by swallowing opium. Then, there was the young Miss Yan, who was abandoned by her fiancé and sought redress in the afterlife. And the famous courtesan Li Wen suddenly took her own life. Although these people who "rashly took their lives" were of different categories and different qualities, they were all young women. Suicide by young women, and the social nature that suicide manifests before our eyes, is the same.</p>
<p>The reasons for these young women's pessimism and suicide are that some have experienced all the hardships of life and deeply feel the economic oppression; some yearn for the ivory tower of "love above all else" and suddenly encounter the disappointment of disillusionment; some admire the vanity that can make women proud but cannot find it; and some have experienced the world and cannot escape the dangers and deceit of society and people's hearts. In any case, if we do not imitate the attitude of journalists to get to the bottom of things and pursue the facts, we can synthesize a fundamental question of why these women commit suicide and why it has become a "fashionable" trend.</p>
<p>The current so-called new slogans of "women's liberation, equality between men and women, and freedom of marriage" are concealing a lot of "freedom" to play with and enslave women when "equality, freedom, and liberation" cannot be achieved among people within society, especially among some "modern" young women who are proud of themselves. Because the so-called "love" nowadays is completely equal to a Yuan silver dollar engraved on "lace" in an environment where money is omnipotent. With it, there is "love"; with it, no amount of "deep affection" exists. Under this "truth," many sons and wealthy men whose ancestors were virtuous use the power of money to carry out a large-scale purchase of "love"; and many "modern" girls also dream of marrying a "golden turtle." But since there is "love" with money, after asking about it several times and promising oneself in body, how can one guarantee that they will follow each other for life and not be discarded like worn-out shoes? This makes many young women who are full of dreams of being a wife and grandmother inevitably suffer "abandonment" and "heartbreak." However, the allure of cars and foreign houses ultimately makes ordinary "modern" women yearn for them, which makes many women who lose this dazzling expectation inevitably become "pessimistic."</p>
<p>Even so, there are still many enthusiastic young women who dream of finding a lifelong companion with deep affection in this social arena; it's just that such "Camellia" girls rarely encounter the "Armand" of the time, making them deeply feel that the "love scene is full of illusions" and have no desire to live, so they abandon the world and kill themselves. As for many women who have not competed in this "love scene" and are destined to become mechanical slaves, although they may not commit suicide in despair of life, they are forced to embark on a path of chronic suicide.</p>
<p>The inability of women to be economically independent drives them to increasingly flaunt "modernity" and auction off "love," which repeatedly leads to abandonment, heartbreak, and suicide. At the same time, in a society where money buys love, it creates their extreme "vanity," but they always feel "disillusioned." Naturally, this phenomenon will intensify with the deepening of the economic panic, causing young women to embark on the "tide" of suicide. If women's economic independence and the system that prevents women's economic independence do not change, I am afraid that the suicide of young women will become a serious problem that is "flourishing" and "getting worse."</p>
<h3 id="e309">A Record of the Second Public Performance by the Shanghai Nameless Drama Actors Association <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Xuefei</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Nameless Drama Actors Association held its second public performance of spoken dramas at the Lakeside Society on the 26th of this month to support unemployed workers and the rent reduction movement in Shanghai. There were two performances, day and night. I went to see the night show, which consisted of the following four acts: (1) The Vagabond, (2) Brothers, (3) One Hundred Pounds, (4) Living Together in Three Families. The first five acts of the four acts were probably foreign scripts, while the last act, "Living Together in Three Families," was newly written by themselves. Its content depicts the pain of the recent Shanghai rent burden.</p>
<p>Among the four acts, the one that won the most applause from the audience was "One Hundred Pounds." The content of this act is roughly as follows: "On the bank of a river in Ireland, a British police chief waits for an escaped revolutionary, hoping to capture him and exchange him for a reward of one hundred pounds. But the Irish revolutionary is not like the one depicted in the reward notice. Another poor singer plays a six-stringed lute and sings moving songs, warning him that he is the person he wants to catch. However, with his wit, he not only avoids the police chief's suspicion but also persuades him to escape from his grasp. 'A hundred pounds reward, a hundred pounds!' The police chief asks himself empty-handed if he is a fool." (According to the program notes). The plot is also very ordinary, without much twist, but the performance of the actors is excellent. Especially the dialogue, every sentence is powerful, every sentence is humorous, it is really wonderful to the point of perfection, there is not a sentence that does not have a very profound meaning. Listening to it is like drinking mellow wine, like reading famous verses, one only feels refreshed and everything is possible. This is naturally because the script was originally written well, but the fact that the actors were able to perform it appropriately made the essence of the whole play completely revealed without any omission. We see how much extremely profound and rich poetic meaning is contained in his (the actor's - the poor singer's) every move, every word. His clothes are extremely tattered, his face is dirty, and his legs are spread apart, but at the same time, his words are satirical, his actions are strange, and at the same time, it can be said that he is unconstrained and transcendent. Furthermore, we can also see that the passion in his heart is particularly unrestrained, and his thoughts are extremely calm. Ah, what a lovable person this is! No matter how ugly his appearance is, we only find him lovable. Not only lovable, but when compared with the noble and decent gentlemen, young masters, ladies, and young ladies, we only feel that the rest of the decent people are not like people, and only this ugly singer is the only true person! What a profound and powerful satire this is! The actor has grasped this profound and powerful satire completely and presented it to the audience without missing a single detail. I think, although I am a layman when it comes to drama, the audience cannot but say that this act was very successful.</p>
<p>Secondly, "Laure" in "The Vagabond," "Chen Guiqing" in "Living Together in Three Families," and "Su Wei's Mother" also each had considerable success in their performances. The actor who played Laure portrayed the typical egotistical of the general petty bourgeoisie (although Laure is a worker, he is a foreman, and his consciousness is petty bourgeois, and he used to be a running dog of the capitalists) to the point of being extremely meticulous. Chen Guiqing in "Living Together in Three Families" was drunk and adorable, and his words and actions were very humorous. Su Wei's mother was a living, ignorant old woman. I don't know how the actor was able to portray her in such a strange and interesting way. The tone was like a painting, and it was really a credit to the actor for being able to think of it and do it.</p>
<p>Looking at the plays as a whole, although there are many loose and rough spots, we can be very satisfied with this achievement.</p>
<p>A few days ago, we had almost no plays to see. Movies are either just lively and prosperous or their content is completely distorted. It is rare to have such a public performance of spoken dramas, which provides us with some spiritual food. Although its content is not necessarily very progressive, it is still good. Therefore, in the end, I hope that the progressive drama circles in Shanghai will have the opportunity to give us a few more public performances.</p>

<h3 id="e310">Come Back, My Child! <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Bo'er</p>
<p>In the quiet garret, you could hear the clock next door striking five. Wasn't it so? Another day had passed like this, and the few small coins in my pocket had been spent like this. Getting up early every day, sitting tightly in front of the desk, holding a pen, I really don't know what to write. Writing some articles can be sold for some money to maintain life and remedy your unemployment period. This temporary way of life seems easy, but it also seems very difficult. Looking at me today, with my head down, sitting for a day, I don't know if I wrote a dragon or a tiger? I feel very tired myself, and my head also hurts. I thought I had to run outside to change the air.</p>
<p>It was just in the fifty minutes between my going out and coming back, these hateful fifty minutes. When I just stepped into the alley, the little maid A Dou ran to the road in a panic. She passed in front of me but didn't see me. I thought she was rushing to buy things to cook, so I casually called out to her: "A Dou! Where are you going?" When her eyes turned to my face, she grabbed my clothes, knelt on the ground with both feet, and shouted: "It's not good! Younger brother is gone! It was just for a moment! It's not good, where can I find him?" She said and stood up again, turned to the police, and knelt down again, using the same anxious tone to ask him for help. The police officer may have had too much experience and was used to people losing their children. He was not sympathetic. He calmly said: "Then you should look around! Who told you not to be careful?"</p>
<p>When I saw this situation, I was already numb. He was lost, he was taken away, how could I find him back? My heart was panicking and aching, but I didn't cry. I quickly jumped into a rickshaw and drove straight to the Yokohama Bridge District Office. The person sitting in the office asked me to fill in a form after opening a notebook. After I wrote my name and age, I began to seriously question him: "If I write like this, can you find my child back? Other people's lost children can be found, right? Or not? What method will you use to help me find him? Aren't you going to hurry up? Why are you sitting still? I must find him!" Regardless of what answer he gave me, I was extremely anxious and only knew how to ask him. The person in the office thought I was too strange. He was conscientious and finally promised that I could make a phone call to other district offices to teach them to pay more attention to me.</p>
<p>"Pay attention! Is paying attention enough? If I had money, if I threw my banknotes on your table, then couldn't you grab the swindler at the train station, on the road, at the street corner, or anywhere else? Get my child back? Forget it! Even if my child is sent to someone else from your hands, do you think about how he will cry tonight? How will he look for his mother? Is paying attention enough? Good sir!" This crazy shouting made the office man stand up angrily and slap the table. He wanted to argue with me. I remember that there was a person wearing a military uniform next to me. He persuaded him and sent me out the door. At that time, my tears rolled down from my deep eyes.</p>
<p>Sitting in the rickshaw, it pulled me home. Many women were standing at the door, discussing, but they didn't actually help me find him. They just talked. I couldn't help but hate them. I regretted going out for a walk just now, and I hated the article I wrote even more. How much money can it sell for? My child is lost, what is the price? Ah! Maybe he is being hidden in the room next door, but as long as someone intends to do evil, then even if we are in the same Shanghai, on the same road, or even in the same alley, we are still forever separated. He is calling for his mother, and he cannot hear his mother's response. How pitiful he is! I don't understand why people want to make him lose his mother's love and snatch him from my arms? Even if he can be sold for money, how much is he worth? Twenty yuan? God knows! A pair of ladies' silk stockings hanging in the company's glass window are not also marked at twenty-odd yuan? ...</p>
<p>Come back, my child!</p>

<p>— Yu Mei</p>
<p>The third girl woke up when she heard footsteps outside the wall. She poked her head out of the quilt, lifted the curtain, and saw a glimmer of white light through the cracks in the closed wooden window. She shrank back into the quilt and pressed her naked hot body a little closer to the man.</p>
<p>The man's fatigue had not yet recovered, and his breathing was still even. The third girl licked his lips and jaw, but he was still sleeping soundly. The third girl stroked him for a while, afraid of waking the man, so she first left his body and put on her shirt. She heard that there were already many pedestrians outside.</p>
<p>She went to the water boiler to rinse water, washed her face, and also woke the man up. The man was putting on his clothes. She prepared the wash water and put it on the table. She put a piece of cloth from the bed into the compartment under the cabinet, and smiled silently at the man, implying something.</p>
<p>There were footsteps outside, and her husband was back. She hurriedly went out and saw that her husband's hands were empty, but she was a little surprised that there was a smile on her husband's face. She asked,</p>
<p>"Did you bring back the tobacco ash?"</p>
<p>"I forgot." The man smiled.</p>
<p>"Go and get it quickly, I'm going to cook the opium soon, there's not enough ash at home."</p>
<p>Xu San went with another kind of joy. The man in the room was buttoning his clothes while saying he was leaving.</p>
<p>"Haven't you washed your face?"</p>
<p>"I'll wash it when I get back. I'll send the fabric when I have time." The man smiled and went out the door.</p>
<p>She stood outside the door and watched him walk away. The mud on the street had all frozen into a layer of black ice, and there were still piles of snow by the wall, with a layer of black ash on top. The snow in the tile gutters on the roof opposite was white.</p>
<p>When Xu San walked into the room with a smile holding the tobacco ash, her dissatisfaction with her husband was not as great as it was last night. Xu San handed the tobacco ash to her and seemed particularly gentle. He sat on the edge of the bed and asked,</p>
<p>"Is your head still hurting?"</p>
<p>"I slept all night, and it's much better."</p>
<p>Xu San slowly took out a five-yuan bill and two yuan from his purse.</p>
<p>The third girl asked in surprise: "Is it the money for the opium?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't sold half of the opium yet. There are still people smoking."</p>
<p>"Then where did it come from?"</p>
<p>"I picked it up."</p>
<p>"Where did you pick it up?"</p>
<p>"I picked it up under the table leg in the gambling house."</p>
<p>"Was it last night or this morning?"</p>
<p>"It was in the middle of the night."</p>
<p>"Fortunately, I asked you to sell the opium, so you made some extra money. We're bound to have good luck this year."</p>
<p>"I'm exhausted. You can take this money first. I want to sleep for a while."</p>
<p>"Okay, you sleep."</p>
<p>"You stay with me."</p>
<p>"I stay with you? Won't you cook the opium?"</p>
<p>"Let's cook the opium tomorrow." Xu San said, taking off his shoes.</p>
<p>"That's right, I haven't weighed enough opium yet. Let's borrow two taels from Xiaoyuzi's house this afternoon and add them to cook."</p>
