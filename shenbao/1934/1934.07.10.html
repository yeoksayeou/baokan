<p>— 敬</p>
<p>我國以農立國。農村經濟實爲國民經濟之骨幹。不謂年來農村破產之呼聲。竟一變而為日常之口頭禪。農民痛苦。日深一日。故豐歲僅足圖溫飽。水旱</p>
<p>不免於溝壑。一旦天災襲來。在農民固乏抵抗之能力。在政府亦少補救之良方。終至束手待斃。同歸於盡而已。最近河南洪河·沙河·漯河等水。决口數十淹沒平漢綫遂平臨穎一帶。盡成澤國。襄河亦决口數處。鄂西之汽車路。多被衝壞。大有釀成洪災之勢。他如平津之間。　河永定河等。亦傅宿洪陡發水勢暴漲廊房楊村。路軌被淹。告急文電。雪片飛來。反之。江南各省則普遍苦旱。驕陽</p>
<p>肆虐。稻秧多枯。秋收歉薄。朕兆已見。困苦艱難之農村生活。至此乃加多一重桎梏。哀我小民。其何以堪耶。</p>
<p>防止水旱天災。端賴水利。嘗考華北各省之所以水災時作。總因在治水工作但重堤防。而鮮顧疏𣿼。夫整頓堤工。或能防範一時洪泛。而决不足以恃諸永久。是以華北各省。河流暴漲歷久不退。卽有汎濫之處。疏𣿼之道旣廢。而�</p>
<p>舊時溝洫亦因年代悠久而漸至消滅。僅有少數較大之河流。究不足以資宣泄。夏秋水漲。乃往往突破範蘺而傾瀉千里。今華北水患之危機以現。未雨綢繆。固不可或緩。而秋汛期間。轉瞬卽屆。揚子江及珠江漲水之恐怖。亦亟應。嚴防。民國二十年太水災之慘狀。當猶在吾人之心目中也。聞水利家言長江自宜昌以下。水流漸緩。兩岸沖刷漸多。因泥沙之滯積。而形成沿江之冲積地帶。循至各漲水湖沼如洞庭如鄱陽。日漸淤塞。畜水面積逐漸减少。最易汎濫成災。又聞湖沼周圍之人民。多筑堤排水。以期變作耕地。此爲當事者計。洵有開　之利。無如因此而釀成莫大之水患。使多數人盡蒙其害。則固有嚴加取締之必要也。</p>
<p>我国歷代素有治水之方。如川西之灌口。因人工修築而致沃野萬顷之利。黃河之裏套。因水闸調節。而收膏膄千里之譽。是皆成於秦漢之季者也主事</p>
<p>者共人與骨皆已朽矣。而遺澤民間。亘古猶存。以今視昔能不愧怍。</p>
<p>今日我國科學。誠不如歐美發逹。而較之前人。固已便利多多。疏𤀹溝渠之工作。在陜甘在河南已次第進行。或已漸見其利。然僅限於局部。未能普及設有水患。疏導效力。仍極低微。於民生之補益。亦屬有限。避免水災旱魃。旣非�</p>
<p>與辦水利不爲功。而興辦水利。則須以整個之計劃。作全面的設施。但以今日疲弊之民力。實不能勝此重任。計惟有運用政府之權能。盡力爲之而已。古人云。人定勝天。豈虚語哉。</p>

<p>昨日（九日）爲國民革命軍誓師北伐紀念日、全巿各界代表、於昨晨九時齊集巿黨部大禮堂舉行紀念會、到巿黨部陶百川、淞滬警備部熊禮賢、巿公安局李澤民、土地局裘允明、江海關監督署汪宗建、巿敎育會周斐成、巿農會兪振輝、婦女國貨年運動林克聰、滬南區農會潘榮庭、中華靑年恊會徐重華、巿合作事業促進會李時雍、碼頭業務所喩九臯、少年宣講團尹勇、安徽旅滬學會吳建之、新亞中學陳邦彦、愛國女校張靜宜、江境小學李菊林、　誠小學尹知仁、曁各機關團體學校黨部等代表二百餘人、行禮如儀後、卽由主席陶委員百川報告、略謂、中華民國有兩個重要紀日、一爲十月十日、一卽七月九日、前者爲開國紀念日、後者爲復興紀念日、無十月十日、中國固無今日之民主共和國、然無七月九日出師北伐以復興中華民國、則國已不國、雖有民主共和政體亦無多大意義、考七九北伐所以能收復興中國之効、第一因有三民主義之昭示、第二因有蔣委員長之領導、第三因有忠勇將士之犧牲奮鬥、第四因有中國國</p>
<p>民黨黨部之策動與援助、第五因有民衆之切實合作、有了以上五種原因、北伐遂能迅速完成、不過吾人應了解、北伐之完成僅爲革命之開始、而非革命之完成、北伐之完成、離開革命之完成尙遠、因爲三民主義之革命、在民族方面要從廢除不平等條約、以求國際地位之平等、在民權方面、要從實施地方自治以求政治地位之平等、在民生方面、要從平均地權與節制資本、以求經濟地位之平等、凡此皆非北伐一端所能濟事、而有待於吾人之繼續努力、故曰革命尚未完成、同志仍須努力、世人因爲認北伐之完成、卽爲革命之完成、難怪要對革命懷疑和失望、故吾人今後務須認清此點、賡續革命之工作、而其努力之途徑、第一應當一心一德、建設一個統一的強有力的中央政府、而擁護之、監督之、北伐出師宣言、曾謂北伐之目的、在建設統一的政府、以爲打倒帝國主義之基礎、此項要求、吾人務必求其實現、第二應當在此統一政府領導之下、恢復軍政時期之工作、繼續訓政時期之工作、開始憲政時期之工作、惟吾此處所謂軍政時期、係對外的、而非對內的、是在以國際間之敵人爲對象、而從事國防之建設、凡百設施、皆當以對外之軍事爲中心、以求收復失地、復興民族、同時爲求民眾之更密切的合作、應當踐諾如期制定憲法、開始憲政時期、並在民選政府領導之下、繼續今日訓政建設之工作、以求民權民生主義之澈底的完成、如是則北伐之功不致失墜、而北伐也更有意義了、</p>

<p>目錄（一）介紹夏令良好讀物二十種</p>
<p>（二）重要信箱三件</p>
<p>（一）長令良好讀物二十種　許多讀者來信要求有夏令特殊的讀書指導、這是因爲夏天過𤍠，硬性的書實在有點讀不下去，有一部分讀者是學生，是有暑假的，就是在寫字間做事的朋友，也有一些到了下半天就不辦公了。空闲的時光很多，很可以淸閑讀一點書。其他每日照常忙十二小時的朋友，雖然談不到憇暑，但氣候確也要影響他們的生活的。夏天確也想能找點淸凉一點東西調劑的生活。因此，上期本刊即提出徵求讀者對於暑天讀物的意見，本週承讀者𤍠心投函，我們收到的材料已不少了。現在參考大家的意見，選出二十種書，分文學十本，社會科學性質的十本，供暑期的研究。</p>
<p>一，文學書：</p>
<p>一，文心（開明版）二，歐洲文藝發達　　　史（開明版）三，最初的歐羅巴之旗）　　　春光版）四，在黑暗中（開明版）五，　　　法律外的航綫（幸墾版）六，西綫無戰　　　春（光華版）七，懺悔錄（世界版）八　　　，而已集（北新版）九，子夜（開明版）　　　十，懷鄕集（現代版）</p>
<p>二，社會科學性質的書：</p>
<p>一，孫中山先生傳（商務版）二，什麽　　　是物質（幸墾版）三，社會科學講話（　　　開明版）四，資本主義國際與中國（申　　　報館）五，法國大革命史（神州版）</p>
<p>六，蘇聯現狀論（申報館）七，五年計　　　劃的故事（新生命版）八，章乃器論文　　　集（生活版）九，湘鄂皖贛視察記（申　　　報館）十，國際新聞讀法（生活版）</p>
<p>（二）信箱</p>
<p>一，函購（讀者通信箋）請附寄費　日來本外埠讀者紛紛向本部郵購讀者通信箋，均未附寄寄費，致本部無形增加一筆小小損失，因爲通信箋的定價完全按照成本，現外埠已賣出二百餘冊計損失已達十餘元，影響本部預算甚大。現在我們要求讀者諸君，以後郵購外埠請附寄費五分，本埠請附寄费二分，已收到本部信箋尙未附寄費者，並望補寄，郵票十足通用。　　二，徵求對於讀物的批評　本館圖書計數千種。同一性質的書籍最多亦有達數百種者。其中自然有不少的名著値得大家精讀，但亦不免有些不衛生的糧食，仍在外間流傳，這是非常的引我們不安的。本部原有將本館藏書精確的檢查計劃，實際的負起（借書指導）的任務。但數月以來，本部因人手的不够，雖然做得精疲力倦，到底還未能達到所希冀的萬一。現在我們决計將這項工作向全體讀者公開，要求大家來做。凡國内出版圖書，不論本館已備未備，在你們讀後，不論内容的好壞，或印刷錯誤有所發現，即請簡明的開出寄給我們。供我們的參考，並要求全國、𤍠心敎育的人士，隨時給我們一些關於這一方面的指示。我們以爲這是一件非常有意義的工作，允其在出版批評不健全的今日，我們應該用集體的力量來做的。我們等候諸君對於這一要求的𤍠心的回答。</p>
<p>三，郵借擴大到外埠　凡外埠參加讀書指導部的讀者，均享有郵借之權利。但須經過一月與本部經常發生讀書通信的關係，方可取得。這已在早幾期的本刊上，一再發表過。近日還有許多讀者，參加本部後並未提出向本部借書的要求者還不明白我們對於外埠讀者還有這一供給讀物的方便。現在爲避免一一作　時的麻煩起見，特在此處再公佈一次。凡已參加本部研究的諸君，如果需要我們供給書籍，可向本部提出要求，當按照一定手續，介紹本館郵借部，使大家都有書讀。</p>

<p>同時，在光緒那一方面，他倒十二分的達觀，因爲他認識得非常的眞切，他知道在這樣的環境之下，自己要希望執政，直如大海撈針一般的不可能；至少限度，在太后活着的時候，他不用想再做一個舒舒服服的眞皇帝了。所以他倒並不悲傷。他把自己的遭遇。槪付一於命運，這樣的一瞧，料他的精神上，竟逾快得多了。就像這一次上奉天去，他雖明知是太后心要監視他，但他只當是自己有興想出去遊玩；一路上憑着車窗，恣意的賞覽野景。待到每一次列車停止的時候，我們這些人除掉少數須留着服侍太后外，其餘的都可以走下車去隨便閑逛；這時，光緒也往往跳下來，跟我們在一起走動。他的身量很短小，臉上還帶着幾分稚氣；但並不驕傲，說話也很暢達動聽。他對我們這些女官，都看得像朋友一樣。我的小時候的經歷，他大槪也很淸楚，所以他時常想跟我說話。他問我關於歐美各國的鐵路的情形，以及各國當時的君主或元首們的性情和軼事；我只把自己所知道的少許吿訴了他，他已是非常的歡喜滿意了。</p>
<p>（要如在事實上我是一個眞正的國君的話，）有一次，他狠興奮地向我說道：（能够像老佛爺一樣的有權統治全國，那我第一步就要照着你所講給我聽的那些外國的君主或元首的辦法，上全世界去走一圈·當然，我也歡喜微服出遊，不願意使人家知道我的眞面目；因爲這樣的遊玩，才有滋味；像此刻我們是多麽的拘謹？（七九）</p>

<p>— 馬石痴</p>
<p>樓面上一顆蜂房，擺着將近一年了！午夢醒來，常常聽到蜂子的排衙，聲音幽默而緩和，嗡嗡地，使人感覺心靈的陶醉！</p>
<p>春天來了一隻蜜蜂，身子比較普能長一些，顏色是黃黃的，這大槪就算蜂王吧！那個王位，不知道是羣蜂推戴呢？抑是武力攫取的，暫時不去睬它，但看它的形狀，呆呆地，死叮在一方蜡排的中央，每隻蜂子飛繞着，彷佛擁護似地，口裏啣些小花瓣，大家努力地工作，行動是合邏輯的，生活是怪幸苦的。</p>
<p>一天，來了一隻烏黑的山蜂，那是另一個種類，身子像蜩蟾般大，形狀醜惡得可怕，首先，在房外打了一轉，它大槪瞧見裏面物質的舒適以及食糧的豐足，眼漸漸紅了，最後它聳着翅，直闖到蜂房的内層。</p>
<p>立刻，整齊的羣衆，起了騒動，蜂王放出奇異的呼喊，慘厲而緊張，大槪是在號令着，同時，每隻蜂子吐棄了小花瓣，很令地和那隻山蜂摶鬥，那傢伙，首先恃着氣力，也就使勁地反動，但經不起一致的有紀律的襲擊，不久，狼狽下來，終於給羣蜂活活地刺死，咬死。　好！抵抗勝利了，秩序漸漸恢復了，每隻蜂子重新銜起小花瓣，嗡嗡地，老是幹那幸勤的生活，同時，那只蜂王也就回復了中央的本位。</p>
<p>瞧到這一役，立刻，我明白，團結的力量，實在偉大，並知道那隻蜂王所以受着同類擁護的緣故，原來，它自有它的本能，那個王位，並非得之於徼倖，至少，它能禦侮，它能守土！</p>

<p>朱先生，是農村中一位坐冷板櫈的敎書先生；因爲深得一般鄕下人的信仰，故其門墻桃李，倒也着實不少。不過他本人的學問，有限得很；因此在敎書和握管之際，未免時有别字讹音，以及用得（驢唇不對馬嘴）的典故。</p>
<p>鄕下人所以送其子弟入塾讀書，無非要想使他多認識幾個姓名；因此他們所用的讀本，還是那些（三字經）（千字文）（百家姓）（………）這類東西。而朱先生在敎（百家姓）的複姓（万俟司馬）的（万俟）（音同木其）二字時，竟把它讀作（萬侍）一樣的聲音。有人對他說：（這應該念成（木其）讀它（萬侍）是不對的。他把臉孔一板道：（豈有此理？）不見麻將牌中的一萬二萬……非卽這個小寫的（萬）字？至於（俟）是等待之意，誰都知道，試問錯在那裏？此人見其無理可喻，也就默不作聲。</p>
<p>一天，有人請他寫一張學習木匠的投師據，他居然（當仁不讓）地直任無辭；等到寫好以後，見者莫不捧腹。原來他在據中結尾地方，加上一個匪夷所思的古典，（日後如能夢筆生花，實出師父之賜）！或戲之曰：（木匠用的斧頭，並非是筆，應云夢斧生花，才稱得體。）他至此方悟自己援引的失當，頓時臉紅起來；然猶强辯道：（木匠用的墨斗中，到底還有一支竹製的筆；那末，不能算是完全錯呀！）</p>
<p>聽說他現在依然坐擁（臯比）過着（猢猻王）的生活。</p>

<p>第三十一回</p>
<p>三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣</p>
<p>全營殉國赤眼入槍林</p>
<p>自强在坑上呌着，打過十幾砲了，自言自語的道：有一口氣還得幹，在坑上躺着，算怎麽回事？兩手向榜秫上一拍，人直跳了起來。這大砲聲，果然比什麽藥劑，都要興奮，只是他這兩手一拍後，人的一切精神，都恢復了原狀，跳下床來，就向外面跑了去。當他跑出屋來時，正好一顆砲彈落在那屋頂上，將整個屋頂都塌落下來了。自强不等砲彈打來，只當那一種嗚嗚怪呌的聲音飛到，已是伏在地上，及至砲彈落地，撲了一身的灰，回頭看那屋時，變成了一堆亂土，在裏面療養的幾個土兵，那就不必說，當然犧牲了。自强立刻感到這一條身子，現在完全是檢來的，將這檢來的生命和敵人去拚上一拚，這正是最値得的事情。於是找着一名弟兄，問明了營長在堡城上，一口氣跑到寳芳面前，挺着身軀，行了個軍禮。寳芳道：你完全好啦？自强道：好了，什麽都能幹了。寳芳道：好！你還是去帶自己一連弟兄去。敵人不到兩千米達以内，别開槍，沉着氣。自强答應着是，退開來，找着了自己的弟兄，他們猶如失乳的孩子，找着了母親一樣，雖然有軍紀在那裏管着，大家在極小的聲音裏，也表示着歡迎的態度，轟然着一聲。可是他們都聽着代理連長的命令，各各守住了堡城一個垜口，在下面，半蹲了身子，向外靜候着敵人。自强道：我來啦。說了這句話，不到五分鐘在堡子外雪地裏已經微微的透露出敵人的黑點影子，這實在不能容忍了，機關槍和步槍，堡上便開始射擊起來。因爲守軍，旣作防禦戰了，他們要隠瞞也是來不及，他們素興拿出硬幹的態度，向城上回擊過來。（四三○）</p>

<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>我國之諸家藝術，發軔最早，成功亦多。實非如歐美之各種藝術，竊我唾餘，師我故智，因襲而成者，所能仰望於萬一。所可憾者，在我大都以不傳之秘，始足爲貴。個人莫不喜據爲私有，習慣相沿，無法糾正。在生子而賢者，差幸得保留遺傳一二。設子孫不肖，或才力不逮者，則此人物化，其藝遂亦亡矣。在歐美則不然，必一反其道，每有一技之長，半藝之發明，咸主公開，以求同好，互相發明，砥礪研究，務必使其藝光昌與進步無所底止。實則試考其來源，多半剽竊東方古代文化，不過肯下死工夫，加以深刻之研究耳。有河北雕刻名家張治魚者，家於舊京，工書法，能文章，尤精治印刻竹。生平未嘗以其藝自私，時以傳授爲旨，故頻年出其門下者，不知若干人。按刻竹之藝，始於宋，盛认明，淸代則以嘉興爲最，江之北，似無聞焉。張年二十，即浸沉寢饋於治印刻竹，排日默索古思，期於此道中，另闢蹊徑，顧若無師承，但向壁虚搆，終能悟出至理，而成名家。初張嘗游市　，觀市售竹扇柄上之刻法，極不雅馴，乃購歸，以治印之刀試補之，亦居然得心應手，能如意所欲，後遂自刻，三年之中，未嘗少輟，其毅力恒心有如此者。最精湛之刻件，則以磚泉拓本摹臨於竹器上，殆後扇骨上盛行書畫，時賢爭相仿效，張亦起而優爲之，如所謂（留靑法，）（湘妃補花）等，皆爲其發明創造，（補花）尤難，蓋湘妃竹骨至嫩，製器及扇時，每將皮劃傷，致妨害刻書畫之原定計劃，然而良竹精品，棄之殊可惜，不得已因材制宜，就傷處補刻花紋，而梅枝最爲補花中合宜之刻畫；故凡有受傷之件，一經張補刻梅花，不但無削足納履之弊，且妙手天成，眞如天衣之無縫也。</p>
<p>生平每對人言：（藝術之道，難雅而易俗，工夫愈深者，愈易流人俗化。猶之行舟，逆流而上，需數人之力，未必果如我期；順流而行，一人搖漿，不難立就，此俗雅之所以分也。）又論治竹謂：（雅者似逆水行舟，用力多，運用智慧變化，刀法亦多，成物治雅，至其雅處則難口說，祇有心會而已。譬如有雅人當前，固亦無異於常人，實不知雅果何在？若一經臨大節而不奪；臨大難而不苟，方知其雅也，蓋可表現無遺矣。刻竹亦如之，應有不可磨滅之精神。百讀而不厭，處處足耐人尋味，斯眞爲雅矣。若夫一覧無餘，再觀而惡心，其失雅莫甚，失雅則爲俗。筆軟而難硬，硬者爲雅；對刀易深，而淺者爲雅，單刀易淺，而深者爲雅。猶詩以拗句爲佳，難能而後始足貴也。）</p>
<p>張治印多仿古人撥　法，製銅印紐多種，三十年以來，所刻竹件，達三四千，治印亦萬餘方，其成績良足驚人。發行之印譜與刻本，题名（印痕），刻多立軸章法，悉摹古今名人之精品，且能亂眞，幾使見者不知爲刻本也。印則以袖珍小印爲最妙，神氣兩皆獨絶。鬼斧神工，嘆觀止矣。</p>
<p>張又創印泥七種，冬不凝，夏不洩，白文不露地，朱文不糢糊，若以火烤之，黑如墨者，能返還本色，眞良品也。舊京某名流，嘗願出資令其設肆應世，後究不知實行否，不過張旣不以所得自秘，其製法，當亦廣傳於平津間久矣。</p>
<p>者洹上主人袁塞雲先生曾書撰聯語贈之云：（應合竹人印人傳，直追張顚米顚書。）又丹翁贈詩云；（印人旣燕昌，竹人又希黃，書家則二水，三張并一張。）是皆於志魚深致傾慕者也。</p>

<p>我國女子敎育、已有數十年之歷史、祇以素爲男子敎育之附庸、不爲社會人士所重視、近年法令規定男女敎育機會均等、女子敎育遂由附庸地位、崛起而與男子敎育分庭抗禮、其所取之途徑何如、關係於家國前途者至巨、年來因男女敎育機會均等之故、各級學校多側重於社會人之培植、而忽視家庭人之養成、影響所及、流弊滋生、結果造成多數女子祇事消費、不事生產、在今日之中國、殊不需此、倘長此因循、漫不注意、危害家國、爲患實深、吾人認爲民族之復興、必有賴於女子敎育之發達、同時又深慮今日之女子敎育、轉爲復興民族之障礙、是以吾人主張今後女子敎育之新動向、應側重横的發展、不應再側重縱的發展、爰略舉事實以見改革女子敎育之刻不容緩、並陳述吾人所主張添設之女子生活學級辦法及實施方案如左、</p>
<p>（一）現時女子學校、泥於男子敎育平等之原則、眛於男女生理與需要之不同、多側重知識灌輸、而忽視家事實習、至於在男女同學學校之女生、因程度不齊、能力差異、日致力於學科之研討、鮮有暇重視家事之練習、以致事實上形成女子未入學校以前、尙能躬操家事、旣入學校以後、反一事不能操作、未受敎育以前、所以消費家庭者尙少、旣受敎育以後、所以消費家庭者良多、　至成爲不能適合於家庭之女性、</p>
<p>（二）現時女子學校、對於凡百事務、多責成各級職員與校工處理之、學生對於生活起居、不過坐享其成、視人事應對爲繁文缛禮、怠於習練、憚於躬行、無形中造成依賴·懶惰·簡慢等等惡習、鮮有刻苦耐勞之精神、與應付適度之能力、</p>
<p>（三）年來女子服飾、無日不在變動之中、所及影響、學生亦尤而效之、裝飾趨時、競相炫耀、課餘暇日、多喜作不必要之社交、及無裨益之活動、惡習相因、於今爲甚學校當局或狃於風尙之所趨、或誤於潮流之不可抗、漫然視之不加糾正、致養成浪漫墮落驕傲奢侈等等惡習、使我國回有道德漸爲　喪、將來此等女子持家不能爲賢良之主婦、育兒不能爲幸勤之慈母、</p>
<p>（四）女子學習普通科學、其目的原欲藉爲進修高深學問之基礎、及改良家庭獨立謀生之工具、而事實往往與目的相反、今日事實所昭吿於吾人者、除少數天才而有志於事業之女子、能以所學從事於社會服務外、多數女子、一經身入家庭、生育子女、則所學一切往往束諸高閣、社會事業多因牽累而不能參加、於改良家庭、未見有益、於圖謀生活、依然無補、事之不經濟者、孰有甚於此乎、</p>
<p>上列諸弊、俱爲社會共認之事實、並非故意指摘、今日女子敎育之疵點、以堅吾說之足信也、亦非抺殺一切女子敎育之縱的發展、而謂女子敎育祇應有橫的訓練也、良以家庭爲社會國家之小單位、女子爲家庭之主婦、下代國民之慈母、無良好之家庭、焉能有健全之國家社會、無賢良之主婦、則男子雖服務於外、而仍有内顧之憂、甚至事業因之敗壞、品格因之墮落、無美善之母性、則子女行爲、無人示範、健康無人注意、幸福無人護持、下代國民於幼小時、即受此不良的家庭敎育、將來影響於國家社會者、其禍害爲何如、故吾人以爲女子實際上從事於社會事業者爲數極少、而負家庭重責者、仍爲最大多數、爲求收穫改良家庭振興國家之實際效益起見、應使最大多數女子受橫的敎育訓練、不應再使女子敎育側重縱的發展、徒造成多數徒事消費、不事生產之女子、以陷家國於極危之境也、抑更有言者、社會風氣之良否、男女實應負同樣之責任、今日男子敎育之必須改良也、固不待言矣、今日女子敎育之不良、基於上說、自亦無可諱言也、女子旣於不良的敎育之下、　喪其本性、則女子敎育愈發達、社會上浪漫享樂之女子愈多、此等女子愈多、社會之風氣愈壞、家庭之崩潰愈速、因果相生、將不知伊胡底、是以吾人爲挽救頽風、復興民族起見、用特不避社會一般之譏評、提出改良女子敎育之意見、擬成草案、敬質高明、並呈准江蘇敎育廳於省立揚州中學，先行添設初級女子生活學校從事實騐、規模不在大、設備不在精、而在實事求是、樹立風氣、尙希有志改良女子敎育之人士、予以指示與贊助、俾其辦理完善、足資觀摩、以爲挽救女子敎育不良風氣之嚆　、倘事可實行、成效日著、吾人固引爲欣幸、而家國前途實利賴之、茲將訓練方針、辦法要點、及實施計劃、次列於后、</p>

<p>— 黃懷白</p>
<p>蕭伯訥的戲劇Ｐｙｇｍａｌｉｏｎ第二幕裏，有一個掃地夫杜力特向黑菫思敎授索他的女兒五金鎊身價時，黑菫思掏出荷包，加倍的給他十金鎊，誰知這位勞苦的掃地夫，嫌給他的太多了，拒而不受，說出下面一段話來：</p>
<p>（不要，相公。她没有心胸把十鎊用完，而且也許我也不敢。十鎊錢眞太多；有了十鎊使人覺得有掛慮起來，那末快樂就完了。你照我所請求的给我，相公！一個子不多，一個子不少。）（據林語堂譯文更動一二字）</p>
<p>這在一般庸俗的人看來，掃地夫不是一個傻子，就是一個近於理想的君子國裏人。其實，兩者都不是掃地夫的見解；他的見解，却是從他豐富的生活經騐上體會出來的。人生的一切西洋镜，揭穿了，橫直也不過這麽一回事；金錢這東西，當然不能例外。人之所以異於禽獸者幾希，這幾希，或許有人認爲就是多了（金錢）這項東西吧。然而，這樣解釋，總是欠妥。可憐的人們，始終不曾打破這個啞謎。錢不多的時候，蠅營狗苟；等到錢太多了，又要掛慮着如何安排和處置；以掛慮始，以掛慮終，一生數十寒暑，就這樣過去，心境未曾得着片刻的恬靜，這眞是何苦來！他種動物的本能生活，與我們得天獨厚的人類比較，當然是相差太遠，可是牠們没有掛慮，却高人一等。所以英國詩人Ｗｉｌｌｉａｍ　Ｂｌａｋｏ一首詠蒼蠅的詩，最後一節是：</p>
<p>Ｔｈｅｎ　ａｍ　I　　If　Ｉｌｉｖｅ　Ｏｒ　ｉｆ　Ｉ　die·</p>
<p>我們要抛却一切的掛慮，就是一個快樂的蒼蠅。然而，在偌大的世界上，找幾個身心上毫無持慮的人，恐怕是不可多覯吧。渺小的蒼蠅，也是以自豪了。</p>

<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>在厦門，住在一家臨着港灣的旅館内。寂寞時，打開窗子遙望，鼓浪嶼的洋式建築和坡頭綠蔭，便像誰在使用繪畫那樣手法似的，在對面的水上分明地展畫出來，表露着一種誘人心目的風姿。窗下時常送來搖櫓的聲響，只要伸頭出去，就可以看見一船一船的闊男闊女，穿着華麗的衣衫，花朶一樣地點綴在港灣的水上。他們不是從厦門到鼓浪嶼去，便是由鼓浪嶼到厦門來玩的。</p>
<p>只要到鼓浪嶼去遊玩一遭，便覺得那裏實在太宜於阔人住的了。依着海岸或是爬到坡上去的馬路，都有着靜寂和淸雅的南國風味。一些帶着白色窗幔的别墅窗眼，則從綠樹枝葉的稀疎處，悄悄地窺着緩步而行的遊人。車馬的喧囂，市聲的繁噪，簡直是没有的。大約鎭日只可以聽見海風徐徐踱過林間，和早晚泛在街頭的學童的歡笑吧。</p>
<p>去遊玩的時候，打算順便兌換一兩張從南洋帶回來的外國紙幣，因爲我推想匯豐這一類的銀行，總在鼓浪嶼的租界裏面的。但尋來尋去，只找到了中國人開的銀行，而匯豐之類的外國金融機關，相反地却是設在比較鼓浪嶼爲不甚安全的厦門市上。這樣看來，的的確確須要安全的，倒是中國人自己。先前由南洋回來，搭乘華僑的輪船，看見泊厦門時，堅起了大不列顚的旗子，心裏頗以爲怪，等到遊了鼓浪嶼，曾經瞥見了一眼古老的中國後，責備别人的念頭，也就全然消失了。只是這樣想着：</p>
<p>（老中國呵，滿心依戀着你的，大槪目前單是那些赤足了的愛兒吧。）</p>

<h3 id="c268">金聖歎底意識問題 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 耳耶</p>
<p>（極微論）已經碰了壁，金聖歎底私淑弟子們底面子有點坍台。該找甚麽機會再給金老夫子辯護一下呀！於是余楊靈先生底文章出來了。</p>
<p>金聖嘆把水滸和左史莊騷放在一起，尊之爲（才子書），其中並無惡意，倒是極正確的見解，正和現在的批評家重視描寫黃包車夫的小說一樣。至於（才子書）云云、不過是明人習用的濫語，也和今人動不動便說（天才）（偉人）一樣。（參看七月四日自　　由談，余先生原文。）</p>
<p>這一段話是甚麽意思呢？我說過金聖歎有惡意麽？我說過他底見解不正確麽？我没有！我只是在指出金聖歎底意識是屬於甚麽的。由尊贵者羣底觀點看起來，不錯，金聖歎是（並無惡意，倒是極正確的見解）。至於（現在的批評家）或（明人的濫語）甚麽的，自然也對；可並没有證明金老夫子底意識不是屬於尊貴者羣。不過余先生還有爲金聖歎底意識辯護的文章在下面。</p>
<p>金聖嘆倘以（尊貴者羣底意識）來選書，那是决不會選到水滸的，甚而他選到水浒了，而且把純然是故事的連綴的一百二十回本，删成七十回，這是一種有目的的工作，其目的就是暴露官僚政治的黑暗，指出梁山泊集團的社會的成因，贊揚游民階級　　的義氣。</p>
<p>不錯，（這是一種有目的的工作）、可惜這裏說的這（目的），只是余先生現在爲了爲金老夫子辯護才想出來的；金聖歎自己並没有這樣說。二十年前，我就讀過金聖歡底（以丸泥封函谷）（即用水滸杜天下亂萌）的水浒序。可惜現在忘記了。有點另外的批語底磊意還記得，就舉出給余先生看吧。</p>
<p>林冲是第一個上梁山的人。他底渾名呌（豹子頭）。爲甚麽呌（豹子頭）呢？金聖歎底高見：豹子是吃父母的，等於無父無君的惡人。梁山上的强盜，都是無父無君的，都是豹子。林冲頭一個上山，又是頭子之一，所以呌（豹子頭）。這說法，跟余先生現在所說，是怎樣的不同！至於（金聖歎倘以尊貴者羣底意識來選書），爲甚麽（决不會選到水浒）的理由，余先生没有說，我也只好一從略）。且看余先生底下文：</p>
<p>他把故事中寫得十分忠義，惟盼望招安的宋江，奚落得一文不値，試問這是何種意識。</p>
<p>從這幾句看來，我幾乎疑心余先生讀的另一種金批水滸。金聖歎奚落宋江是不錯的，但他所奚落的，剛剛跟余先生所說的相反，不是（十分忠義，惟盼望招安的宋江）；倒是十分假忠假義，拿願受招安騙人，而實際甘心做强盜的宋江。大約讀過金批水滸的不止我跟余先生兩個人吧。（試問這是何種意識）？答曰：這是尊貴者羣底意識，不折不扣。　以下，余先生引了一大叚金聖歎底話之後，說：</p>
<p>這一叚說明官僚政治下的無限的剝削及其必然的結果，豈能說是出於（尊貴者羣的意識？）</p>
<p>眞奇怪、余先生憑甚麽斷定尊貴者羣就一定没有人反對（官僚政治下的無限剝削）呢？又憑甚麽斷定反對（無限）剝削，也就一定反對（有限）剝削呢？其實，尊貴者羣，有限多人反對（無限），希望，（有限）。最早的是孔孟。孔子要人做好人，孟子要人過好生活。他們底著作中，没有一句贊成剝削的話；剛剛相反，有很多反對剝削的話。但是他們都是尊贵者羣底意識。閒話少說，鈔點余先生引的金聖歎底話：</p>
<p>嗚呼！天下者，朝廷之天下也，百姓者，朝廷之赤子也；今也縱不可限之虎狼，張不可限之饞吻，奪不可限之肌肉，塡不可限之谿壑，而欲民之不畔，國之不亡，胡可得也！</p>
<p>滿口（朝廷）（朝廷）地（試問這是何種意識）？答曰：這豈能說不是出于尊貴者羣底意識？</p>
<p>結論：</p>
<p>第一，金聖歎底意識，是尊貴者羣底意識。</p>
<p>第二，金聖歎底意識，不能說不是出于尊貴者羣。</p>
<p>第三，金聖歎底意識，跟余先生所斷定的不同。</p>

<p>— 草明</p>
<p>當醫生檢查完了，說那孩子已經長滿兩個多月了的時候，我氣得眼睛核子也跳出來了。那婦人像給疲倦弄麻木了，並不驁慌地坐着，毫無表情地叙說她爲了饑餓，同隔壁一個病倒了的婦人丨丨那孩子底母親丨商量，結果花了幾個銅板買一碗猪血回來塗在孩子頭上，這樣，抱了孩子就跑到平西里來了。</p>
<p>（先生，要是你來遲一步，我今晚可以吃個飽，那孩子底母親也可以給醫生診診脈了。　（可是，你曉得你自己在欺騙人家麽？你曉得你是犯了法麽？）</p>
<p>（眞的，我不曉什得麽呌做法。）</p>
<p>我想起來不識字的人底苦處來了，故意平心靜氣地向她解釋說：（法律就是保護人民底利益，保障人民的安寗的，比方現在你犯了法，騙了人底錢，我得拉你到公安局去受懲戒…………）</p>
<p>（哦，這個法我是懂得的。不過懲戒了我，那是保障了誰丨丨爲什麽不要我的利益呢，先生？）</p>
<p>我搔了搔頭，一會兒才說道：（大家呀。呌大家不要受騙呀！）我很滿意自己的回答。</p>
<p>（法爲什麽不呌我好好地有碗安樂飯吃，爲什麽不呌那孩子底媽不病？先生，難道我敢說，你也在欺騙我麽？）</p>
<p>（趕快抱了孩子，帶了騙來的錢跟我一道到區裏去！）我記得我這樣喝駡了。</p>
<p>轉到僻靜的盤福路的時候，我站住了，從口袋裏掏出張唯一的一元鈔票。遞給她，用低沉的音調勉勵地對她說：（算我今天倒霉吧！可是你回去之後，要修修自己，做個安分良民呀！）這樣我們分了手，你想我底心多麽軟弱！</p>
<p>（要是下再玩一回把戲的時候，在什麽地方可以再叨光你一塊錢呢，先生？）後面揚起這輕輕的一句，我掉回頭的時候，鬼影者没有一個了。</p>
<p>富生，你打算做點慈善事業麽，你自己以爲你在救什麽人麽？可是你錯了，你好像一點也不曉得有那麽一句俗話：慈悲是蹲在法律脚底下的。懂了？是的，你還得多訓練一下呵！）</p>
<p>我們底區長這樣對我說，往後他就老老實實把我訓練起來了。（完）</p>

<p>— 寒白</p>
<p>衝破了六十年來高温度的紀錄，長日的紅光，蔚藍的星空，慢慢地度過着一天，一夜。這樣就震撼了農村中每一個耕夫的腦脈，心臟，看來今年大約是荒歉的年成了！</p>
<p>於是一般的所謂倡人道主義者，迷信者，大吹其（祈雨）的法囉。江陰由紳士祝丹卿領導，邀請公安局長縣長共同參加，無錫常州……也同樣地在禁止屠宰，虔誠地希望老天能發一些善心。這是什麽現象啊！我們明明知道現在是一個二十世紀的時代，是科學最發達的時代，人們已經由自然支配人類的鐵練中解放起來的時代。科學吿訴我們，（雨）是自然界的現象，由水蒸氣遇冷而變成的。要是以人力來希望落雨，那决不是迷信宗敎而可以奏效的，必須要利用已經昌明的科學來駕御自然才有可能。據最近蘇聯通訊：製雨機器的成功，是一個很明顯的例子。</p>
<p>那末一般迷信狂𤍠者，爲什麽要那樣做呢？我覺得他們是想把世紀的年齡�</p>
<p>，大减而特减至數百年以下，使人民恢復到中古時代；他們是想否定科學，不，是想毁滅科學。因爲科學對於社會的命運，是課以一種運動的任務的；而迷信則是永遠宣吿着貧苦大衆的奴隸死刑。</p>
<p>無疑義的，迷信是欺騙者的精神工具，是反科學的先鋒，不拘在什麽時代，貧苦的民衆們，開始想到兹於他們困厄的眞正原因的時候，在迷信者看起來，是覺得非常不利的。所以從來在這社會裏面，爲使這般貧苦民衆的注意力，離開地上的物質生活的考察；對於現世不滿的情緒，移轉到來世的希望方面，迷信是一種最有力量的工具，這是歷史吿訴我們的事實。好像（祈雨）這件事吧！很顯然的，是地方領袖者對於人民給人們的一個空心湯團吃，蒙蔽人力可以克服自然支配的眞理，迷信的面目，在此地是暴露得最明顯不過的了。</p>
<p>科學我們忍心地破產嗎？忍心地被反動勢力襲擊嗎？不，我們是應該來維護科學，防衛科學的，條件是在大家勇敢地樹起反迷信的大旗來。</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>江南的夏天，太陽儘在大地上燃燒；𤍠的風吹遍了江南的農村，和都會層裏。這一星期以來，氣壓常在一百度以上，小雨没有下過一次，人們却正在渴望看甘霖。（大旱之望雲霓！）雨，已變成了無上的至寳。黃梅的季節，竟想不到會這末的亢旱，農村裏的阡陌，底都裂了開來。風吹在人們的身上，是𤍠烘烘的。荒草的原野，樹梢上的葉兒，和地上的草芽都已焦了頭；田野裏的禾苗盡乾枯了。農人們已没有地方去戽水，只有望着一片給囇枯的禾苗　氣！</p>
<p>丨丨咳！旱象已呈，荒年又到！一年的收成，又已完了；這眞是老天爺在要窮人的性命啦！</p>
<p>可不是嗎？米價這幾天中突然飛漲，一星期還不到，然而已經提高了三四元一石，這不是呌一班窮人的日子更難過了嗎？</p>
<p>一個淸晨，太陽剛從東方透出了半個臉來：阿六叔帶着一臉的憂鬰，從一間破茅蓬屋子裏踱出來，跑到門前的曠塲上，一眼看見金狗丨丨他的兒子丨丨同隔壁王老二的女兒阿翠，正在草地裏搶撲一對花蝶蝴。他便惡狠狠的向他們俩盯了一眼，他預備把一大肚子的憂愁，在金狗身上出氣的。</p>
<p>丨丨大淸早起來，好好的屋子裏不住，到外面來尋魂！露水也不怕，弄濕了衣服你媽有工夫給你洗。横堅今天米也没有了，南瓜還在開花啦；看你只好挨餓去！給你吃了一天到晚只曉得玩，玩餓了好吵吃。阿銀今年才九歲呢，他會帮媽割羊草，拾柴，不像你這樣淘氣的東西，挺不久調；照這樣的年歲荒下去，吾只有拿你去做和尙的。</p>
<p>他們給他嘮哩嘮叨的駡了一大串，便也各自扮了一個鬼臉，溜進茅蓬屋子裏去了。</p>
<p>他沿着村子前的一埭塘岸走去，一條沙堤無盡長的在他面前展開着；一帶垂楊，無力地倒頭在河畔，河裏的水已涸得剩了底裏的一些，水色已泛了紅，一股臭味直從河底裏翻起來，怪難聞的。</p>
<p>那邊，一望無際的田野，泥塊都已發了白。他看了這個樣子，祇看搖頭，太息，失望的悲痛只不住地在他胸頭襲擊。他失望了，他一年的汗血都給太陽晒乾了！他慢慢地把頭抬起來，望望萬里長空的天際；没有雲，没有風，只有一爿鐵板似的靑天，和一輪紅灼灼的矯陽，在水平綫上，漸漸在向上升高。</p>

<p>據說：今天縣府裏出來一個吿示，因爲天氣亢旱，人民又要遭遇饑荒之災，一切花木，都將被乾死了，所以整批整批的農民都結隊向縣裏去請願，要實行斷屠，虔誠祈雨。他們唯一的理由是這樣，祈雨算不來迷信的，因爲首都還在請ＸＸ大師祈雨呢，這是國民政府體騐老百姓，愛護老百姓的緣故。</p>
<p>縣老爺和别種老爺會商的結果，實在没法將他們的理由駁回，並且爲要想使鄕民喊幾聲靑天大老爺的原因，遂允許斷屠一星期，同時，並請ＸＸ大法師等，設壇在縣西十里左右的郊外祈雨。　　擇定了Ｘ月Ｘ日卯正開壇，由ＸＸ大法師主壇，率領着全班法師，虔誠地施法，祝吿，祈禱；這天縣老爺，和黨部裏的委員老爺，鄕紳等，都撥冗蒞臨的，儀式當然十二分的隆重。</p>
<p>ＸＸ法師，披了袈裟，仗劍登壇後，口中唸唸有詞，其他各位法師，也都一樣的跟着附和，樂器是叮叮噹噹的嚮得震天，把手裏的一塊靈牌，砰砰硼硼的亂碰。烈日晒在光頭頂上，汗珠却大　大顆的往下抛着，彷彿斷了綫的珠子似的。縣老爺和黨委老爺及幾個有名的　　下接第三版</p>

<p>法師們是感到無限的漸愧！縣老爺，黨委老爺，和各鄕紳是每個人都顯着失望的面孔。</p>

<p>— 文黑</p>
<p>兄弟之死給我的悲痛，如今是第四回了！</p>
<p>三弟之死正在家庭破產那時候。他自小是一個好動好玩的孩子，那時他小學畢業家庭没有錢給他升學，而他也是一個不喜歡坐冷板凳聽鄕下敎師敎法不良的講書的學生，他說没有趣味，他要通感受舟車勞頓所致的病，醫得他胸部心口如火燒；改了另一個所謂名醫再用凉藥醫治，就這樣活活將她醫死！我從她病到死，都在她身邊，那一種悲慘的狀况不是引我悲傷而是引我憤恨，所謂醫生原來是殺人的會劊子手！</p>
<p>五弟之死，那時我離開家鄕在外邊讀書了，聽到他的死訊，我哭了！他爲什麽死的呢？也是小學畢業以後没有升學兀在家裏，而因這個緣故受了家庭的刺激，肺病死的。他的性情很柔順，小學畢業後曾經到過一個親戚店裏學生意，不料半年便失業再找不到事做了；回到家裏，他的母親丨我那庶母丨終日嘮嘮叨叨地責駡他，不賺錢光吃飯，令他憂兀流涙地只是挨駡；不久肺病已成，他對於人生毫無興趣，索性不吿訴人，要等死。一個十幾歲的孩子終日在吐血等死，父親還不知道，母親也不管他，一直到他苦笑地對着家人死去，這是多麽悲傷的一回事呵！</p>
<p>爲了三個弟妹之死，我常常對父親說，對於弟妹是應該好好地敎育他，看護他，不料最近家裏來信，十弟又死了！十弟在我離家那年丨我也就離家八九年了丨他只是七八歲，去年他給了我一信說是小學要畢業了，我喜歡他，我時玩；可是他在家裏自己會造火車汽船火槍，他是一個富有機器製造的心才的人。我常常對父親說，三弟給他進電器工程學校，將來一定是一個工程師；可是爲了經濟的關係，連中學都没有給他去升學。他喜歡玩，因此在玩足球跌傷回來以後病倒，却不敢吿訴父親說是跌傷，由鄕下一個庸醫將他當做普通發燒醫治，病重了又當做傷風醫治，一直到他發狂死去。他的死一半是自己，一半是庸醫所殺，那時我在外面起初不知道，到了他病危回來看他的時候，已經没法挽救，看他在發狂呌喊的痛苦中死去。三弟之死，令我恨庸醫；可是還没有二妹之死，令我對於庸醫的痛恨之深。</p>
<p>二妹暑假從遠方的不用學膳各費的學校回到家鄕，那時我在自己村裏敎小學，她到家就害了病，我不相信平常家裏请來的醫生，特地去請一位所謂名醫來看她，不料這一位所謂名醫也是一個飯桶，他診脈以後，說是在學校用功過度，虚弱之症，就用補藥，將她一個普常給他通訊，我吿訴他許多書本以外的智識；今年春天父親勉强設法給他升學進家鄕新辦的初中，我寄了兩塊錢給他買雙新鞋去上學，不料又因爲生病死了！父親信裏說，因爲家裏没有錢，没辦法去請西醫生，就被中醫生醫治，終於没法挽救死了！信裏雖然没有提什麽病，可是，無疑地又是被庸醫殺死了！十弟我是愛他的一個，他那一種似乎天眞似乎傻氣的表情，至今還令我回憶起來，呌一聲二哥，他的眼睛就笑迷迷地睜着，嘴吧就呆呆地張着，我眞喜歡他，我眞愛他，如今是死了，是被庸醫殺死了，丨我的可愛的弟弟哟！我愛他，我願意夢中再會他一面！</p>
<p>家庭一破產，經濟不能維持，弟妹們都死在庸醫手裏，什麽時候才有那一天：公立醫院遍設各個鄕村。人民的疾病由公家去負責醫治，人民的健康由公家去保護呢？世界現在只有這麽一個國家，她的人民的生命是有保障的，咱們中國究竟要到什麽時候才有那麽一天呢？</p>
<p>由於兄弟的死亡，死於庸醫之手，死於没有錢可以醫好的情况下，不禁令人喝望着完善的社會的來臨呵！</p>

<p>很多人拿命運來比擬季節的，那末春天是給誰的？秋天是給誰的？</p>
<p>大都會裏有春天，亦有秋天，有姑娘香酥的肉，也有苦人的血和涙……</p>
<p>據說住慣都市裏的人是不大會曉得季節變遷的，這不知道是個甚麽意思？可是我只自己想着：大小姐的粉腿少在街上顫跳了，許是春天去了，但是我一眼看見黃包車未堅起的汗毛間直淌下來的黃水，我凝視了一回天上的藍雲，我又疑想着這時是春天還是秋天！</p>

<p>雖然，故鄕裏有嫩綠的桐蔭，好看的花草，小鳥的歌，和不要錢買的月光，可這年頭，種田人種得命快種出啦！没法子，我只有拖了老婆二個孩子上都市來！</p>
<p>上都市來，看見湧着的人像水潮，穿藍粗布的人眞少，老婆咬著我的耳朶說：（這兒的女人家面皮眞老…）我倒也很够味着這套把戲，女的掛在男的身上滿街子跑。</p>
<p>夜裏，鬼火大閃着眼，火籠一條條不知千萬，二個孩子快樂得直跳起來，我也在苦臉上說着淺笑，從此許會走到了春天？</p>
<p>第一次做生意，跟着阿八哥在車身後拉一個黃毛外國人，當他不出錢想走時，我想去和他講道理，豈知道冷不旁給他摑一光，再一彈腿，我看看對我們獰笑的中國人，我看着噙住了眼涙的阿八哥，我的心要暴炸啦！</p>
<p>現在手撫着硬的鬍子，揑揑乾　　的手膀和腿，想起了死了的妻，賣完了的二個孩子呀！我走錯了這條都市的罪惡之路！我的春天在那裏？</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是不學無能，智識淺陃，爲終身良伴問題，懇煩先生於業餘之暇，爲我指導。我現在學生求學時期，父親定要與我定一親事，係屬舊禮敎的女子，而我自己已有意中人，其人曾受過高小學校敎育，愛情於表面上很爲專一，　屬太自由，常不安於室，喜做竹城之戲，近又學於跳無。爲此，殊使我精神痛苦，曾忠言勸吿，但她不因愛我而稍改。至於那舊禮敎的女子，是我隔鄰，從小認識的人極誠實，惜不識字，且常識全無。不過能盡婦道，頗具三從四德。然人生終身良伴，爲一世之事，婚姻美滿與否，與畢生幸福有關。有智識者難於管辖，以目不識丁者易於管轄；但茲事體大，我不敢斷定那個能得圓滿結局。故求</p>
<p>先生於短期間指導，不勝感激之至。此</p>
<p>撰安　　　　成榮</p>
<p>答：若把結婚祇看做是性慾的滿足，男女的結合那就毫無問題，不論與誰都可以結婚。（但是人類不是禽獸肉體的調和，不够滿足他比慾望更高尙的要求，在此，非有要和他的結合者之間的精神調和與吸引不可）（夏倍倍爾婦人與社會）我們對於結合者，應當審愼到雙方肉體與精神是否能調和。所以你提出的（终身良伴）問題確有討論的必要，不過你把（一）新式女子與舊式女子，（二）敎育程度，（三）那個易於管轄作爲選擇的基點，這我却不能同意。你想管辖女子完全是從男性支配的地位說話，這種以女子爲工具的觀念，在現在根本不應存在。受過新思想薫陶和敎育程度祇是男女雙方趣味能够接近的條件，究竟能否使彼此的精神調和還須看雙方整個的，主觀的旨趣和思想，還是不能機械地斷定的，你對那（意中人）雖則頗爲愛好，但你又討厭她喜歡（竹城之戲），（跳舞），這些，都是使你們精神上不能調和的。你對於那舊禮敎的女子，祇是嫌她没有常識，不識字，至於你們趣味，思想上有無衝突，你却没有說。就我的觀察，你對於她精神工似乎頗能調和，因爲你也並不是非舊禮敎的男子！這理由並不是因爲你反對你意中人跳舞又麻雀，她那種低級趣味的愛爲享樂誰也不能贊同的，你以管轄女子的心理來判斷那個是終身良伴，這纔是澈頭澈尾的露骨的你充滿着舊禮敎的表現。我意你還是與那舊禮敎女子結婚，在思想和生活方面或許都能接近，但這並是因你易於管轄她。男性支配女性，是决計不能寛容者。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Central Government Holds Revolutionary Army Swearing-in Memorial; Wang Jingwei and Dai Chuanxian Give Speeches; The People of the Country Should Sacrifice Their Individual Freedom and Equality to Obtain the Liberation of the Entire Nation and the Independence of the Entire Country <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government and the National Government held a joint Revolutionary Army Swearing-in Memorial Meeting and the 138th Enlarged Memorial Week at the Central Party Headquarters auditorium on the morning of the 9th at 8:00 AM. The interior and exterior of the auditorium were decorated with banners. Among those present were Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Chu Minyi, Zhu Peide, Zhou Qigang, Shi Qingyang, Zhu Jiahua, Fang Juehui, Chen Ce, He Yaozu, Huang Fusheng, Liang Hancao, Wang Qi, Zeng Zhongming, Mao Zuquan, Chen Shuren, Duan Xipeng, Fu Rulin, Gu Zhenggang, Xiao Jishan, Li Ciwen, and heads of various departments and committees of the National Government Lu Chao, Wei Huai, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Qicai, Chen Zhuo, He Jian, Wang Yongbin, Lin Xiang, Cao Haosen, Tong Guanxian, Xiao Qin, Mao Zhongfang, and representatives from various institutions, as well as staff from the Central Government and the National Government, totaling approximately 600 people. The meeting commenced with music, and Chairman Wang Jingwei delivered a report, stating that today is the anniversary of the Revolutionary Army's swearing-in. The Central Government originally requested Comrade Chiang to give the report, but since Chiang has gone to Xunyang, he has been temporarily asked to give the report. He reported that on the National Government Founding Day on the first of this month, he made a report explaining the general work of the National Government in the one year from July 1925 to July 1926. The Northern Expedition, with the Revolutionary Army swearing-in on July 9, 1926, was a continuation of the work of the previous year, but its achievements were even greater. From July 9, 1926, to July 1927, Wuhan and Nanchang were recovered, followed by Fujian and Zhejiang. After these successive recoveries, Nanjing was then recovered, and Jiangnan was pacified, laying the groundwork for establishing the capital. Although the Ning-Han split occurred in April 1927, there was no armed conflict between the two sides, and both sides worked hard to move north to complete the unfinished work. The Nanjing side sent troops to Shandong, and the Wuhan side sent troops to Henan. The Nanjing side purged the party on April 12, and the Wuhan side purged the party on July 15. Thus, Ning-Han reunited. Therefore, the Revolutionary Army swearing-in anniversary on July 9, 1926, is very glorious and great in the history of the Chinese revolution. This is truly due to Comrade Chiang's excellent leadership and the joint efforts of the Revolutionary Army's officers and soldiers, as well as the intensive work of all party members, which enabled them to win the support of the masses and eliminate large and small warlords one after another. However, some people may ask, why did such a serious national crisis occur after the Revolutionary Army unified China, and why has it not been resolved to this day? To answer this question, we should first silently recall the Premier's last will, "I have devoted myself to the national revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China." Why did he not say to seek freedom and equality for the people, but to seek freedom and equality for China? Because of China's position in the international community, as the Premier explained painfully in the Three Principles of the People, it is in a semi-colonial status. Therefore, the Chinese revolution must first establish its goal of seeking freedom and equality for China. Because we want to seek freedom and equality for China, the people of the country should sacrifice their individual freedom and equality to obtain the liberation of the entire nation and the independence of the entire country. This is the true meaning of the national revolution. The Chinese revolution, after overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, overthrowing Yuan Shikai, and overthrowing large and small warlords, can only be said to have removed obstacles. After these obstacles are removed, we must wholeheartedly begin the work of seeking freedom and equality for China. Thus, the Chinese national crisis did not begin on September 18, 1931, but became more serious after September 18. The Chinese national crisis has been hovering around China and weighing heavily on the heads of the people since the signing of unequal treaties. We are working hard on the national revolution precisely because we want to resolve the national crisis, not because we are working hard on the national revolution that we have encountered the national crisis. We must clearly understand this cause and effect, so that we will not go in the wrong direction. When will the Chinese national crisis be resolved? Our answer is that when we achieve freedom and equality for China, the national crisis will naturally be resolved. When will China achieve freedom and equality? The people of the country answer that only with equal strength can we obtain equal treatment and an equal position, that is, political, military, economic, cultural, and various strengths that are equal to those of modern powers. Although this work is very heavy, hope is by no means dim. Just look at the time of the swearing-in that year, when our strength was weak in quantity, but because of its pure quality, we achieved extraordinary results. From this, we can know that if we have a firm belief in our doctrine and a loving and sincere quality of unity, then our strength will naturally develop, increase, and expand day by day, and eventually we will be able to achieve a strength equal to that of modern powers, in order to establish the foundation of China's freedom and equality. Recalling the past struggles and glorious achievements, we know for sure that the national revolution to which we are jointly dedicated has never deviated in its direction, and its work has never been interrupted. With the Premier's guidance in the front, and with countless martyrs completing their work piece by piece in the back, as long as we continue to work hard, we will definitely be able to fully achieve the purpose of the swearing-in that year, and lead the 400 million people onto the road of freedom and equality. This was followed by a speech by Dai Chuanxian, who said that Mr. Wang had just given a reasonable explanation of the reasons for the success of our revolution in the past ten years, so that our future work will have a unified direction and a clear understanding. We can know that the glorious success of the revolution depends on the strong faith of all people and not avoiding sacrifice. From now on, each of us must be as nervous and unwilling to sacrifice as the revolutionary soldiers on the battlefield, and under one organization and one command, we must bear all responsibilities and work hard on various construction projects like machines, so that the glory of the past will never be lost and the foundation of the revolution will be maintained and consolidated. Only then can we live up to the expectations of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the revolution. After the speech, the meeting adjourned with music. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Our country is based on agriculture. The rural economy is the backbone of the national economy. Unexpectedly, the cry of rural bankruptcy in recent years has turned into a daily mantra. The suffering of farmers is getting deeper day by day. Therefore, a bountiful year is only enough to maintain a warm existence, and floods and droughts cannot be avoided in the ravines. Once a natural disaster strikes, farmers lack the ability to resist, and the government has few good ways to remedy the situation. In the end, they can only wait to die and perish together. Recently, the Honghe River, Shahe River, and Luohe River in Henan Province have breached their banks in dozens of places, flooding the Pinghan Line, and the area around Suiping and Linying has become a swamp. The Xianghe River has also breached its banks in several places, and the automobile roads in western Hubei have been mostly destroyed, with a great potential for causing a flood. In addition, between Tianjin and Beiping, the Yongding River and other rivers have also suddenly experienced torrential floods, and the tracks in Langfang and Yangcun have been flooded. Urgent telegrams are flying in like snowflakes. On the contrary, the provinces in southern China are generally suffering from drought, and the scorching sun</p>
<p>is raging. Most of the rice seedlings have withered, and a poor autumn harvest is in sight. The difficult and arduous rural life has now been burdened with another layer of shackles. Alas, our small people, how can they bear it?</p>
<p>Preventing water and drought disasters depends on water conservancy. It has been examined that the reason why floods occur frequently in the provinces of North China is that the work of water management focuses only on embankments, and rarely takes care of dredging. The renovation of the embankments may be able to prevent floods for a time, but it is not enough to rely on them permanently. Therefore, in the provinces of North China, rivers are surging and have not receded for a long time. Even in places where there are floods, the method of dredging has been abandoned, and</p>
<p>the old ditches have gradually disappeared due to the long passage of time. There are only a few larger rivers, which are ultimately insufficient for drainage. In summer and autumn, when the water rises, it often breaks through the dikes and pours out for thousands of miles. The crisis of floods in North China has now appeared, and it is necessary to plan ahead. The terror of the Yangtze River and Pearl River floods during the autumn flood season should also be strictly prevented. The tragic scene of the great flood of the Republic of China in 1931 is still in our minds. Water conservancy experts have said that the water flow of the Yangtze River slows down gradually below Yichang, and the erosion on both sides gradually increases. Due to the accumulation of sediment, alluvial zones have formed along the river. Following the rising water lakes and marshes, such as Dongting and Poyang, they are gradually silted up, and the area for storing water is gradually reduced, making it easy to flood. It is also heard that the people around the lakes and marshes have built embankments to drain water in order to turn them into arable land. This is for the benefit of those involved, and it is indeed a profitable endeavor. However, it has caused a major flood, causing many people to suffer. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly prohibit this.</p>
<p>Our country has always had ways to control water in the past dynasties. For example, the irrigation system in western Sichuan was built by humans and has brought the benefit of fertile fields to tens of thousands of acres. The irrigation system in the Hetao area of the Yellow River has been praised for its fertile land for thousands of miles due to the regulation of sluices. These were all completed during the Qin and Han dynasties. The masters of events are all dead and their bones are rotten, but the legacy for the people still exists for thousands of years. Looking at the past from the present, how can we not be ashamed?</p>
<p>Today, our country's science is indeed not as developed as Europe and the United States, but compared with our predecessors, it is much more convenient. The work of dredging ditches is being carried out in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan, and the benefits have gradually become apparent. However, it is only limited to local areas and has not been popularized. If there is a flood, the dredging efficiency is still extremely low, and the benefits to people's livelihood are also limited. Avoiding water and drought disasters is not</p>
<p>the same as failing to do water conservancy, but to build water conservancy, it is necessary to have an overall plan and comprehensive facilities. However, today's exhausted people's power cannot bear this heavy burden. The only plan is to use the power of the government and do its best to do it. The ancients said, "Man will conquer nature." Is this not true?</p>

<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, the entire Soviet Union celebrated the eleventh anniversary of the Soviet Federal Constitution. Grand gatherings, banquets, choral performances, etc. were held in various cities and villages. The commemoration in Moscow was particularly solemn and magnificent. The conference was held in the Cultural Recreation Park, with 20,000 workers participating. People's Commissar Mikoyan delivered a speech, saying, (Our task is to seek independence and inviolability, and to create our own industry and large-scale agriculture. As we celebrate the eleventh anniversary of our country's constitution today, we can say that we have created both and have become invincible. While we are immersed in construction, we are deeply aware that there is a threat, that the capitalist world is preparing for war, and first of all, preparing to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are aware of this, so while engaged in construction, we are preparing for defense. The strength of our country's Red Army is increasing day by day. We are firmly constructing our border defenses, especially on the eastern frontier. We do not want to hide this from anyone, because we do not want to attack anyone. We only want to issue a warning to those who attempt to attack us, that before they take this step (which will lead to their own destruction), please think twice and be patient. The Soviet Union has become the true motherland of all the workers in our country, and we will defend this motherland with the last drop of our blood.)</p>
<p>Newspaper editorials claimed that the celebration of this anniversary demonstrated the invincible military and economic strength of the Soviet Union, the unity of the people, and their resolute progress in achieving their ultimate goals.</p>
<p>Chairman Kalinin of the Soviet Central Executive Committee stated to the press, (When the toiling masses of all the nationalities of our country waged a great struggle against landlords, foremen, princes, usurers, autocratic demons, and the bourgeoisie, they forged a single furnace with their blood. They have, in fact, merged into an international fighting alliance. This remarkable fact has been meticulously recorded in the basic law of our country eleven years ago. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was created in the organizational form of the Soviet regime in one country, in which the working class belongs to various nationalities.) (7th, TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia, in its article celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the Soviet Constitution, stated, (The arrival of this anniversary coincides with a major upheaval in the international political situation. The frequent reorganization of foreign political forces, the increasingly acute war crisis, and the profound social and class conflicts are all sufficient to make the picture of the world situation complex and disturbingly varied. At the same time, although the Soviet Union is the target of capitalist imperialist conspiracies, it has developed into a great power of the proletariat, a leading factor in international politics, and an supreme factor for peace in the hearts of the vast masses of the world. The Soviet Union's policy of peace is not an accidental tactic or a curved course created by the current political situation. On the contrary, it is a firm diplomatic policy deeply rooted in the life and activities of the new socialist society.) Pravda stated, (The policy of peaceful cooperation among all nations has made the Soviet Union the true and great motherland of tens of millions of workers of all nationalities.)

<p>(London) Authorities from Britain and France began negotiations today in London, which will have a significant impact on the future situation. Observers believe that the initial meeting between the two countries will develop into a discussion of naval armaments, as British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell and French Minister of Marine Piétri each attended the meeting with their respective secretaries. Both sides are keeping the content of the meeting strictly confidential, but a communiqué may be issued later. The French delegation, consisting of Foreign Minister Barthou, Minister of Marine Piétri, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Léger, and Director of the League of Nations Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Massigli, went to the British Foreign Office at 10:30 this morning and began the meeting with British Foreign Secretary Simon, Lord Privy Seal Eden, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Stanhope, and Bolton. The French delegation arrived in London at 11:18 last night. Foreign Secretary Simon led a number of British officials and personnel from the French Embassy in Britain to the station to welcome them. (9th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-French talks began today, without any predetermined agenda, with the intention of allowing Barthou to freely express his views. The British are particularly concerned about the issue of a "Eastern Locarno" treaty. Regarding the naval issue, the French representatives will only have a preliminary exchange of views during their stay in Britain. Minister of Marine Piétri may extend his stay by twenty-four hours, but he will likely return to France with Barthou on Tuesday. (9th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Barthou, along with Minister of Marine Piétri, is stationed here. The result of Barthou's visit will not be recorded in any official documents. Britain will likely do no more than reiterate its loyalty to the obligations of the Locarno Treaty and its sympathy for France's attitude. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain spoke in Birmingham and denied that Britain intended to form an alliance with France, saying that rumors that Barthou's visit was related to a secret plan to have Britain join a new European alliance were completely unbelievable. "We are not joining any new alliances and do not want to relax our efforts towards pacifism." (9th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Barthou, in response to inquiries from representatives of the British press, declared, "The purpose of this consultation between the two great democratic governments is to strive to achieve peace." Beyond this, Barthou declined to elaborate on the content of the talks. The Anglo-French talks will continue at 3:00 p.m. (9th, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) On the surface, Germany appears calm, but undercurrents of instability continue to make Germans uneasy. The main reason is that 75% of the three million armed stormtroopers will not return to their units after their leave expires this month. The extreme killings in the past week have also caused hatred in the hearts of people across the country, providing material for opposition propaganda. There are many left-leaning dissidents among the disgruntled stormtroopers. The government currently has 100,000 national defense soldiers, Göring's special forces of 12,000 men, and Hitler's Brownshirts of 20,000 men. (7th, China Press Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Basel The directors of the Bank for International Settlements held a preliminary meeting today. It is generally believed that Germany's announcement of a six-month suspension of debt repayments is the main issue to be discussed at the meeting. It is also rumored that the meeting will discuss the elimination of obstacles to the formal participation of the United States in the bank's business. The meeting is being held in strict secrecy. Participants include Harrison, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Vice President Yarborough, Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, and Schacht, President of the Deutsche Bank. (8th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The American Foreign Bondholders Protective Council published a publication containing an article by its chairman, Winckler, on Germany's suspension of foreign debt principal and interest payments, stating, "Germany's situation is becoming increasingly chaotic. If countries do not take appropriate measures to protect the interests of their people and to prevent Germany from becoming a permanent danger to Europe and the world, this kind of peaceful intervention will not cause resistance on the part of the majority of the German people. The situation is the same as in 1923, when France and its allies occupied the Ruhr because Germany refused to pay reparations. French purchases of the Dawes and Young loans account for the majority. If Germany suspends payments on the two types of loans, France will take the opportunity to demand that Germany respect the original contracts. If Germany refuses or is unable to respect them, France will take action to protect the interests of the French people." Winckler went on to analyze and explain how precarious Germany's finances, economy, and political situation are under Hitler's rule, saying, "Hitler and his party said that after the party took power, Germany would become a paradise. In fact, what Hitler said was a decorative phrase and did not correspond to reality at all. Looking at Germany's relations with its neighbors, they are becoming increasingly difficult. Germany and Poland were originally enemy countries. Although they have now signed a treaty, Germany has made all kinds of concessions to Poland, while Poland has given nothing to Germany. Once something happens, Germany will certainly not be able to get help from its eastern neighbor. Italy's Mussolini cannot help Germany. Anyone who knows a little about Mussolini and his policies can say this. Hitler's meeting with Mussolini in Venice in mid-June was no different than returning empty-handed. As for countries such as Romania and Greece, they cannot be regarded as friends of Germany. Unless Germany cancels its demands to amend existing treaties, these countries will not be able to join hands with Germany. Hitler has spent countless propaganda expenses abroad to make foreigners express sympathy for Germany's new politics. However, this kind of money is no different than throwing it into a bottomless pit. In terms of sentiment, Austria should be a friend and ally of Germany, but now it has become an irreconcilable enemy. Therefore, Germany is currently isolated internationally, far more so than it was twenty years ago." Winckler believes that what Hitler and his party are doing is a disastrous policy that will not stop until it is subverted. (8th, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) All national concentration camps will henceforth be under the jurisdiction of Himmler, the commander of the secret police and the Nazi SS, as Himmler made great efforts in quelling the previous incident. The stormtrooper guards at the Oranienburg concentration camp have now been withdrawn and replaced by Hitler's hand-picked SS. It is said that this matter has been brewing for a long time and is now being realized. (9th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hess, the Minister Without Portfolio in charge of Nazi Party affairs on behalf of Hitler, recently issued a declaration regarding the recent incident, stating, "The execution of a small number of traitors was necessary. Otherwise, thousands of outstanding Germans would have died an unnatural death, and even women and children would have been affected. As for the stormtroopers, they have nothing to do with this rebellion. The traitors were only a few senior leaders and reactionary intellectuals. In addition, the stormtroopers have always been loyal to Hitler. I once gave a speech in Cologne, asking everyone to pay attention to those who advocate a second revolution and not be fooled by them. These people have now been executed. If anyone still intends to slander the stormtroopers, I will issue the same warning to these people. Since the execution of the criminals, our relationship with the stormtroopers has returned to what it was before, and in this campaign, Hitler personally went to the stormtroopers to eliminate the traitors, proving that Hitler has the ability to lead the entire country alone. Hitler and the German people have a pure ideal belief. The German people all know that under Hitler's leadership, they will lead their wives and children to fight for this ideal belief." Hess continued to describe the general situation of the June 30 incident and then strongly asserted that the use of severe measures to eliminate the chaos was appropriate, saying that this was the martial spirit of East Prussia, which only the Nazi Party could represent. "(Hitler saved the country from danger with a strong hand at a critical moment, which we are especially grateful for. And I especially feel that it is necessary to state that all those who have been punished by us have confessed their crimes and have not resisted. I believe that some of them were tempted by a regrettable environment for a while and took the path of crime. But this is a matter of the survival of the German nation. No matter how minor the circumstances of individual crimes are, they should no longer be disputed. In short, in the event of disobedience and rebellion, the method of punishing one to warn a hundred must be used. Although the stormtroopers can never be compared with the army, for the benefit of the people, it is still impossible not to add military discipline and military law to it." Hess then made a plea for peace to the veterans of all countries, especially to the French veterans, saying, "General Hindenburg, the great soldier of East Prussia, is the mainstay of safeguarding peace and saving the motherland. Today, only Germany and Italy are the two countries in the world where veterans control the government. This is definitely not accidental, because these two countries are the most enthusiastic about upholding world peace. And Hitler and Mussolini are both veterans of the Great War. The recent meeting between the two heroes in Venice was seamless. This is also not accidental. As for our neighboring country Poland, since Poland signed a non-aggression treaty with our country, peaceful relations have increased accordingly. However, Pilsudski, who controls the Polish government, is also a veteran of the war. As for the French veterans, there are many who express their support for Hitler's attempt to achieve German-French understanding. In short, all of us veterans do not want to sit idly by and allow a group of incompetent diplomats to trap us in the catastrophe of war and make us suffer. Soldiers of all countries know that the last war should not be the responsibility of the military. If someone asks why I didn't say this before, but only say this today, I dare to answer that I didn't want to say anything a few years ago because I didn't want to make the same remarks as the traitors of Germany. At that time, the traitors of Germany vilified the meritorious front-line soldiers and did not hesitate to sign the Treaty of Versailles. These people even chanted pacifism. I am ashamed of it. Today, I will loudly tell the world that (peaceful Germany) and (pacifist Germany) are very different and should not be confused. You should know that any attempt to let a large army drive into Germany will eventually run into a wall." Hess then spoke specifically to the French veterans, saying, "In the last war, France exhausted all its strength to defend its territory. It would never give up even an inch of land. If someone has war ambitions and intends to inflict on Germany what was inflicted on France in the past, we will shout loudly, 'Dare you attack Germany? Dare you enter German territory?' I know that French veterans will definitely be able to understand our intentions. And this new Germany's ambition will soon be known to the world. The French people know very well how people from all countries defend their territory. We German veterans have to express our respect to the French veterans, because in the last war, the French army shed the most blood for the common interests of the allied countries. Although we often hear speeches made by representatives of the French government that do not fully conform to the spirit of international coordination, we still hope that the French government also has the desire for peace. If the remarks made by representatives of the French government are not consistent with the opinions of the French people and veterans, this is the fault of the parliamentary system." Hess continued to speak, expressing high praise for French Foreign Minister Barthou, with rather abrupt wording, saying that German-French understanding would be beneficial to the people of both countries. Finally, he said, "(Poland, Germany's eastern neighbor, has signed a treaty with us to guarantee peaceful relations between the two neighboring countries. It can be seen that signing a peace treaty is more secure than expanding military strength. This will soon be understood by other neighboring countries." (8th, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian Communist Party's organ, Pravda, reported that Germany has suspended debt payments in the hope of using its gold reserves for war preparations. The newspaper went on to say that Germany's increase in military spending by 33% has caused foreign countries to be alarmed, but this is only the beginning. The newspaper considered the most noteworthy aspect to be Germany's commercial figures, stating that while Germany's manufactured goods exports and domestic consumption have declined, imports of certain goods, such as iron, manganese, cotton, and other military raw materials, have increased without decrease. Germany's exports of pig iron and steel in 1933 increased by 31% compared with 1932. Its conclusion is as follows: (1) After the expansion of Germany's heavy industry, domestic consumption or exports have never expanded accordingly, and prices and profits have not fallen. Therefore, this expansion is obviously due to government demand. (2) The increase in imports of certain raw materials, since it has failed to expand domestic and foreign trade, is naturally caused by orders for military industries and the accumulation of military raw materials. (3) 20% of the expansion of German heavy industry and most of the raw materials imported by Germany are used for war preparations. (8th, National Telegram)</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that American newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst recently resided at the Cardiff Villa in Wales, England. Representatives from the local Western Mail and South Wales News visited him to inquire about his opinions on President Roosevelt's naval plan and the current state of the Japanese navy. Hearst replied that he particularly supports President Roosevelt's view that, for the sake of world civilization and peace, disarmament should be prioritized. However, if the world engages in an arms race, the United States will resolutely not lag behind and fall into a dangerous situation. Hearst also said that the Japanese claim they want to build a massive navy, but their financial resources cannot sustain it. He believes that no civilized country should truly spend money that could be used for peaceful development on military buildup. However, the United States will not allow Japan's aggressive military power to exceed its own defensive military power. The United States has always opposed war, so they are willing to generously sacrifice money and lives to protect their coast from war and the horrors of invasion. If there is a competition to build warships and airplanes in the future, the British Empire and the United States will surely prevail for three reasons: (1) They have determination and patience, (2) They are rich in money, and (3) Britain's territories and America's commercial shipping routes are vast, and there is a need to maintain and protect transportation. Therefore, even in times of peace, they already have many ships and airplanes, which can easily be converted for military use in wartime. Hearst argues that Americans should not overly concern themselves with the situation in the Far East, believing that they should not involve the country in foreign disputes. If China cannot take care of itself, it should bear the consequences. China's failure to adequately defend itself is due to its advocacy of an excessively peaceful policy. It is unfortunate that a nation with 350 million people cannot defend itself against the aggression of a nation with 90 million people. He expresses sympathy for China and regrets China's foolishness, but believes there is no reason for them to get involved in China's disaster.</p>

Regarding US-Japan relations, he told people the following: President Roosevelt's visit to Hawaii is for rest and sightseeing and does not seem to have political significance. There are rumors that President Roosevelt will use this trip to meet with Japanese representatives, but he has no knowledge of such a situation. To promote friendly relations between the United States and Japan, commercial work should be the first priority. However, simply making agreements is not as effective as addressing the constant needs and removing obstacles in trade and other areas. The Okada Cabinet also asked Foreign Minister Hirota to remain in his post, which shows that the policy towards the United States remains unchanged. Furthermore, the ambassador is scheduled to stay in Honolulu for half a day to visit the Cole Field athletic grounds.

(2) Japan is not satisfied with its experience in annexing Korea, and may not repeat this mistake in Manchuria. However, it will try its best to expand its control in Manchuria. (3) British tolerance of Japan's aggressive policy has astonished people in Shanghai and Peiping, because Britain will be the most affected if Japan's aggression succeeds. (9th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The key to peace or war between the Soviet Union and Japan in the Far East seems to be in the hands of fate. The area along the meandering Heilongjiang River has historically been a famous powder keg. An incident could trigger an explosion at any time. In the past month, Soviet Russian defense troops fired three times at merchant ships of Manchukuo under Japanese protection, allegedly because these merchant ships were suspected of spying on Soviet Russian fortresses along the Heilongjiang River. Both Japan and Russia are actively stockpiling military supplies, and warships and troops are being built and trained. However, influential figures in both countries are still trying their best to maintain peace. Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has gone to Geneva, hoping to unite the countries that he considers eager to maintain peace. France and the Little Entente may be among the countries that Litvinov considers to be peace-loving. France and the Little Entente are most willing to maintain the status quo created by the Treaty of Versailles, fearing that this status quo will be destroyed by war. The Soviet Union has long regarded the League of Nations as a tool used by capitalist countries to defend against socialism. Now it has abandoned this accusation and hopes to participate in the Geneva Executive Council. The Soviet Union's change of attitude towards Geneva can also be said to be influenced by Germany and Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Soviet Russian politicians have always regarded Germany and Japan as the biggest enemies, and firmly believe that Germany and Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations is aimed at expanding their military power in preparation for future aggression. The Soviet Union believes that other countries in the League of Nations, with a few exceptions, are all friends of peace. If the Soviet Union unites with the member states of the League of Nations, it can strengthen its resistance to Germany and Japan. The Soviet Union now wants to use war to stop war and eliminate past concerns in Geneva. No one in Moscow believes that Litvinov hopes that France and other League of Nations member states will send troops to help if war breaks out between Russia and Japan. However, it is believed that the coordination between the Soviet Union and the League of Nations member states, especially with France, will reduce the fear of attack from the west and increase the courage to attack from the east if war breaks out between Russia and Japan in the East. Soviet Russian politicians now believe that Germany and Japan have a tacit understanding in spirit and are sacrificing the Soviet Union to benefit themselves. They also believe that if the Soviet Union goes to war with either Germany or Japan, the other country will definitely take the opportunity to attack the Soviet Union. This kind of thinking can be seen in Moscow newspapers at any time. The main factors influencing peace or war in the Far East are as follows: (1) Disputes over the Chinese Eastern Railway, which is jointly owned by China and the Soviet Union. Japan is trying to seize the railway in the name of Manchukuo. (2) The two countries are arguing about the price that Japan should pay for fishing in Soviet Russian territorial waters. (3) The Soviet Union deeply believes that Japan has ambitions to occupy the Primorsky Krai. Most observers do not believe that the first two factors will lead to war between the two countries. Most people familiar with the situation in the East deeply believe that the Soviet Union would rather lose the Chinese Eastern Railway than resolve the railway rights issue by force. Although the fisheries dispute is serious, it will also be resolved through tolerant negotiations. However, last year, Soviet Russian politicians repeatedly declared that they would never lose an inch of national territory. Therefore, Japan's ambition to invade and occupy the Primorsky Krai is most likely to lead to war. In the future, if ships from Manchukuo or Japan approach the Soviet Russian coast, or if conflicts occur between the defense troops of the two countries at night, it is easy to cause this kind of misunderstanding and cause war.

(9th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Okada Cabinet, in its first step after formation, decided to retain the Army Minister, Navy Minister, and Foreign Minister Hirota. It also appointed Itō Shin as the new Finance Minister, recommended by former Finance Minister Takahashi. This is undoubtedly intended to follow the Saito Cabinet's national defense, diplomatic, and financial policies to deal with the crisis of 1935. After the policy is decided at the five-minister conference and passed by the cabinet, it will be clearly announced at home and abroad. In addition to these fundamental policies, the new cabinet's policies are: (1) Just and fair politics, (2) Rectification of discipline, (3) Stabilization of national life, (4) Rural countermeasures, and reform of the electoral system. The Saito Cabinet fell due to disciplinary problems. The Okada Cabinet paid special attention to this when deciding on cabinet members, consulting the opinion of the new Minister of Justice Ohara. Implementing just and fair politics is the fundamental basis for stabilizing people's hearts, and stabilizing national life is the fundamental meaning of guiding thought. The rice and silkworm cocoon problems of rural countermeasures are also awaiting resolution. As for reforming the electoral system, it is one of the important missions of the Okada Cabinet. For this cabinet issue, Okada specially appointed former Minister of Agriculture Gotō as Minister of Home Affairs, rejecting the political parties' scramble for this position. Okada has seen through that the next parliament will be dissolved and is determined to use a neutral Minister of Home Affairs to implement fair elections. (9th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The policies and ambitions of each cabinet member of the Okada Cabinet, which has a new lineup to deal with the current crisis, are generally as follows: Minister of Home Affairs Gotō said that he will tighten finances, appoint personnel based on their talents, and follow the policies of former Minister of Home Affairs Yamamoto for relief work. Minister of Justice Ohara said that according to Prime Minister Okada's wishes, he will thoroughly rectify discipline and eliminate the people's anxieties. The Ōkura incident will also be handled in this spirit. For elections, he will definitely follow the new election law and strive to eliminate abuses. Minister of Commerce and Industry Machida said that the historical opposition between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is not good for the country. He will definitely strive to harmonize the opposition between small and medium-sized enterprises and industrial associations, and the industrial rationalization problem. He will review the policies of his predecessor and establish concrete measures from a broad perspective. Minister of Communications Tokuda said that he is a complete layman in communications and will seek guidance from all sectors in the future. He will first strive to dedicate himself to social policy measures for current employees. (9th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Secretary General Takayama Sanpei of the Colonial Affairs Ministry met with Prime Minister Okada yesterday and then attended a meeting of the Colonial Affairs Ministry to report the government's policy, saying that the government believes that the military and foreign ministries have conditions attached, and there are no suitable successors for the time being, so the prime minister will temporarily serve concurrently. The rumor that the Colonial Affairs Ministry will be abolished is completely unfounded. If there are changes in the future, it may be expanded. Also, the heads of colonial territories and the South Manchuria Railway Company will not be changed unless it is their own wish. (9th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Konoe to Be Appointed Colonial Affairs Minister? <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The official denial of the rumor that Privy Councilor Konoe will be appointed Colonial Affairs Minister. In fact, the expectation that Konoe will negotiate to join the cabinet after returning to Japan in August still exists. The reasons are generally as follows: (1) He has the ability to control various agencies in Manchuria, (2) For the sake of national unity, Konoe, who represents the Privy Council, must join the cabinet, (3) Konoe has a very good relationship with the military. Furthermore, Minister of Home Affairs Gotō wants Konoe to run, and veteran senior officials may also encourage him to join the cabinet in order to test him. (9th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Internal Division of the Seiyukai Party - Tokonami Faction Refuses Expulsion <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai Party's attitude towards the new cabinet is to monitor the government's measures and proceed with an attitude of right and wrong. Yesterday, it issued the following statement: Judging from the process of forming the new cabinet, although it is disguised as national unity, it despises political parties based on public opinion. At the same time, it makes political parties its dogs, reviving a bureaucratic cabinet. It has no policies whatsoever, merely increasing the number of cabinet members to bait political parties and reproduce the bad bureaucratic politics of the past, which is a disaster for the nation and has no qualifications to bear the extraordinary current political situation. The Seiyukai Party has decided not to allow party members to join the cabinet. Based on this statement, it will contribute to the progress of the nation based on national and policy principles, while seriously monitoring the government's measures. (9th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The power situation within the Seiyukai Party is that the Hatoyama and Nakajima factions are the party of President Suzuki, with the largest number of people. The Tokonami, Uchida, and Yamazaki factions, which were expelled this time, have a total of more than 30 people. However, this party, backed by the government, wants to expand its power within the Seiyukai Party and cannot be ignored. The Kuhara faction of more than 20 people, which has always cooperated with the Tokonami faction, has now severed ties with Tokonami and shaken hands with Suzuki. However, it is impossible to predict what their future attitude will be. In addition to the above factions, there are also neutral Yamamoto Jotaro and the old Seiyukai factions such as Mochizuki and Okazaki, whose future actions will have a considerable impact on the delicate current situation. In short, how the Tokonami faction will expand its power and how the Suzuki faction will expel the Tokonami faction to resolve the internal disputes within the party is yet to be seen. (9th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because Tokonami, Yamazaki, and Uchida did not comply with the party's decision and participated in the new cabinet, the Seiyukai Party expelled them from the party. As a result, the internal situation of the Seiyukai Party was revealed on the surface. However, the Tokonami faction does not want to leave the party now and plans to stay in the party and have a decisive battle with the party leaders when the opportunity arises. Therefore, the crisis of its split seems not yet to have arrived. The leaders fear that Tokonami will make trouble in the party and plan to take this opportunity to clear the Tokonami faction to cut off the source of trouble. They are currently secretly investigating the actions of the Tokonami faction. (9th, Japan United Press)</p>

<p>(New York) The climate here is dry and hot as usual, lasting for 17 days. Many people have heatstroke, and residents are going to lakes or beaches to escape the heat. The heat wave has been continuous and has set a new record. Today, low clouds are covering the sky, followed by heavy rain and a cool breeze. The temperature has dropped sharply, and residents are overjoyed. There are also thunderstorms elsewhere, and there are many fires caused by lightning strikes, but they were extinguished by the heavy rain, and the losses are minimal. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The drought in the UK is becoming a disaster. Indoor temperatures have reached 30 degrees Celsius, which is exceptional for early July. Many fires have occurred due to the drought, such as the famous Rotterdammerton Forest in Malmesbury House, which was completely burned down. Also, many people have died of thirst due to lack of drinking water on the southern coast of England. London's drinking water is only enough for two months.

Knowing that no one was there, he took many consular documents and letters from the office desk drawers. He intended to leave the consulate with these documents, but was finally discovered and stopped by the Secretary-General of the Consulate and the maid. They ordered him to return the stolen documents and allowed him to leave. (8th, Tass)</p>

<p>Zhenjiang News, the Suzhou Civil Affairs Office issued an order to each county yesterday, saying: (The case investigates that each county strictly prohibits strong drugs, and is now supervising subordinates to actively carry out the order. If each county has drug manufacturing facilities, it is limited to reporting within ten days. I have previously ordered them to comply. The investigations and reports of each county regarding this type of facility are often regarded as empty words, handed over to subordinates, without careful inspection, and simply transferred. Even after the county government has been cleaned up, unscrupulous elements are still inevitably engaged in secretly manufacturing drugs. This creates many obstacles in the future of the prohibition policy. Now, in order to strictly enforce the prohibition policy and clarify responsibilities, each county magistrate should thoroughly investigate and report on whether there are drug manufacturing facilities in the county. If there are no such facilities, they should immediately be responsible for a written guarantee and submit a special report to the government for verification. After the guarantee has been issued, if any of the above-mentioned situations are found in the future, once it is verified to be true, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. In addition to the distribution, the guarantee form is enclosed, so that the county magistrate can follow the instructions to fill it out and report it, without any negligence. This order.) (8th)</p>

<p>Seventeen households, no shops, all engaged in agriculture. However, many men and women are addicted to opium. There are more than twenty opium lamps. There is one official opium franchise, paying a monthly franchise fee of thirty-six yuan. The riverbank produces abundant Artemisia grass, which can be used as fertilizer. Those without the capital to cultivate land make a living by collecting Artemisia grass, which sells for 2.5 mao per hundred catties. The farming method is very simple: turn over the soil, spread Artemisia grass underneath, sow seeds, water, and hope for a harvest. Cow and horse manure is used as fuel. The spring and autumn grain tax is two dou per mu in total. In summer, they plant green beans and millet; in autumn, wheat and peas, each at three sheng. Poor farmers without capital to plant seeds still have to pay the grain tax, so "fleeing households" are better than "extinct households." One-fifth to one-third of the land is already abandoned.</p>
<p>I heard many folk songs, and have selected a few to record below. One is about: "Opium, one tael is worth a thousand gold coins. Which of the brothers isn't addicted? The sound of the opium pipe being scraped is soft. The half-lit lamp illuminates the long night." The second is: "A square piece of land, planted with mustard seeds for three years. When I pick up my rice bowl, I think of you. My hand trembles, and I can't hold the chopsticks." When this song is sung, it is like weeping and complaining, with a strong sense of "every grain is the result of hard work." It shows that it is difficult to eat, especially difficult for farmers to eat. The third is: "My younger sister has a slender waist and small feet; even dumplings eaten on New Year's Day can't compare." On the Lunar New Year, people eat dumplings, the smaller the better. This song is a metaphor for women's foot binding, which is even smaller than New Year's dumplings. According to information, in Ningxia Province, apart from the gradual liberation of female students in the cities, most people still follow the outdated custom of foot binding, especially Hui women in the countryside. The marriage prospects of ordinary women with unbound feet are often not as good as those with bound feet. Military and political figures in the provincial capital often like to forcibly take female students as concubines, which has caused female students to issue a united call for resistance. Ordinary people also like to keep female servants with natural feet, but when it comes to marrying a wife, they prefer old-fashioned women, saying that they can manage the household and handle trivial matters. This is truly unexpected.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Strategic Importance of Qingtong Gorge <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>On the 23rd at thirty minutes past early morning, we set off from the dam, twenty li north, to a place called Qingtong Gorge, which controls the vital passage of the Yellow River and is, along with Shizuishan, a natural barrier of Ningxia. It is a strategic location contested in both ancient and modern warfare. There are one hundred and eight circular pagodas there. The Gansu Gazetteer states that it is the Tianmen Fortress. Later generations have added legends and embellishments, saying that the number of pagodas is constantly changing. Every time they are counted, the number is never exactly one hundred and seven or one hundred and nine. It is impossible to get the exact number. A certain military officer led his troops past here and was very skeptical of this claim. He ordered his one hundred and eight followers to each occupy a pagoda and report the number. Suddenly, one person was missing. He added another person and counted, and there were one hundred and nine. This was simply because the person who was missing was snoring and sleeping and then woke up. The reporter does not believe this story. I asked Mr. Du and others to watch over the car, and we continued along the main road, passed the watershed, and went to Guangwuhou to meet. I and Mr. Xu hired a guide and detoured to see it. At first, we walked along the canal and river, sometimes climbing up hills, sometimes taking off our shoes and wading through water. The red cliffs were high, like Western-style buildings. The crows and pigeons lived in the towers, a fitting place for them. When we arrived at our destination, on the riverbank, there was a Dragon King Temple, empty and without anything. When workers dredged the Han Canal mouth in the spring, they could eat and stay here. On a sloping area, white pagodas were densely arranged like dog's teeth. They were divided into twelve levels according to the terrain, the lowest level having nineteen pagodas. Ascending from the lowest to the highest, the number of pagodas gradually decreased until the highest level, which had only one pagoda. Viewed from afar, the overall shape resembled an isosceles triangle. The highest pagoda was about ten feet tall and five arm-spans around. It was conical in shape and contained a clay statue, which, it is said, was the entire body of Mu Guiying. In 1930, Ma Zhongying captured Ningxia and retreated there.</p>
<p>According to this, Men Zhizhong attacked him. Ma won first and then lost. His soldiers suspected that the gods were not protecting them, so they dug out the face of the Mu Guiying clay statue, making it unrecognizable. Moreover, the attire was very similar to that of Guanyin. It is said that the Mu statue is still a question. Behind the pagoda is an ancient temple with many murals of deities. There is a broken pottery item, which seems to be a platform for a deity to sit on. It is engraved with the eight characters "Thousand Buddha Hall, Jiajing Thirty Years." The other pagodas are smaller in shape. When counted one by one, there are only one hundred and six, and the highest pagoda is also included. One of the pagodas has a single base and a double top, which is probably the origin of the suspected number. Also, at the midpoint of the three sides, about ten feet in front, there is a pagoda. This may be the origin of the number one hundred and nine. As for the number "one hundred and eight," it may refer to the number when the main pagoda on the highest level is removed. The terrain is backed by the high ridges of Niutou Mountain, and in front is the Yellow River. The dangerous cliffs and precipices on the opposite bank are impassable even for flying birds. Most of the local people can recite the lines "When you walk to Qingtong Gorge, there are one hundred and eight ancient pagodas. Walk from the big dam to the small dam, the more you walk, the more afraid you become." When asked for details, they are all at a loss for words. Only the strategic importance of the terrain can be discerned.</p>
<p>There is a ferry at the gorge. There are four or five families of villagers on both sides, who make a living by operating the ferry and burning limestone. The river enters the gorge from Zhongwei and flows through the gorge for more than ten li. The river channel is narrow and the water flow is rapid. The mouth of the Han Yan Canal is located at the end of the gorge. The river surface gradually widens, reaching about 300 meters. Stones are piled up at the canal mouth to form a dam, with mud and grass stuffed in between. Its width occupies about one-fifth of the river channel, forcing water into the canal. The width gradually increases, called the "welcoming water dam." The remaining four-fifths of the river channel has leather rafts flowing downstream endlessly. "Leather raft" means that the entire skin of cattle and sheep is peeled off and the limbs and head are tied up and inflated with air, called "huntun." These are tied to a frame of sticks. The smaller ones are called rafts, carrying a thousand catties of goods or six or seven people. The larger ones are called large rafts or leather rafts, capable of carrying 20,000 to 30,000 catties. They float very quickly, traveling 200 to 300 li per day. However, they cannot go upstream. If boats pass through the gorge, there is no way to return. The leather rafts made of cowhide can be loaded with goods. After unloading, the leather can be folded and carried back. If it is a small raft, one person can carry it on their shoulders, which is very convenient. The Yellow River freezes for about four months of the year, and there are shallow obstacles for about three or four months. The period when rafting is smooth is only four or five months out of the year.</p>
<p>In addition, there are so-called "wool rafts" and "wooden rafts," which are also downstream transportation tools in Qinghai, Gansu, and Ningxia. Wool rafts consist of sheepskin bags filled with wool and other items, loaded with fur, water tobacco, and raw opium. Most commonly, they carry wool, hence the name wool raft. Small wool rafts mostly come from Xining and arrive at Lanzhou. As the river widens, several rafts are combined into one large raft, transporting them to various places in Ningsui. The goods and the wood used to connect the leather bags are sold, and the leather bags are carried back to be used again next time. Wooden rafts are made by residents in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, where timber is abundant, who lash wood into rafts and transport a small amount of goods downstream. The size and shape vary. Most of the building materials needed are supplied by the wool and wood rafts from Qinghai and Gansu. After leaving Qingtong Gorge and returning to the main road, we passed through narrow, winding paths. Strange rocks stood on both sides. Walking side by side, our clothes were snagged. A python as thick as a bowl was coiled in the stone path. It seemed to hear our footsteps and immediately retreated into a stone cave, making a croaking sound. The echo resounded in the empty valley, making our hearts grow cold. Climbing over a high ridge, a vast plain suddenly opened up. The yellow canals and green fields resembled those of Ningxian County. We arrived at Guangwu Fortress, having traveled fifty li. The fortress was as large as a city, with only one gate. Most of the fields outside the fortress were uncultivated. When asked, we learned that some people were using hand hoes to till the land, but it was difficult to cultivate even one mu in several days. When asked where their cattle and livestock had gone, they replied, "They have been requisitioned and have not returned." The price of land was previously thirty yuan per mu. Now, due to the heavy taxes and levies after the requisition, they want to sell it for five yuan, but there are still no buyers.</p>
<p>Thirty li to Qukou Fortress, belonging to Zhongning County. The people live in dilapidated earthen houses. However, the Guan Emperor Temple and Guanyin Hall competed to show off their newly renovated and imposing features. The Chinese people pay great respect to the gods and little to the people. This is not unique to one place. Inside the Guan Emperor Temple, there is an attached primary school. The main hall houses a statue of Guan Yu and a plaque with the inscription "Long Live the Emperor, Ten Thousand Years." Five students sit below, reciting Mencius. It is said that when all the students are present, there are more than thirty. Now, because the food for the entire fortress was mostly requisitioned during the war, the people have nothing to eat. Each person leads their children to the outskirts to find wild vegetables. Moreover, it is spring plowing season, and many students have been called back by their parents to help with the farm work. Therefore, the number of students in school is particularly small. Later, along the way, we indeed saw women and children carrying baskets, gathering in the fields or crawling along the paths, vying to find wild vegetables and bean leaves. The miserable scene was unbearable to witness. Fifteen li to Tietong Fortress. The land is mixed with sand and gravel, making it difficult to grow opium. The people cherish it very much. When wheat is planted, each mu yields only three to five dou, with a tax of three sheng, which is only one-eighth of the tax on fertile land in Xiahe and Liangxian counties. Twenty-five li to Zaoyuan. We chose a shop to stay in. That day, we traveled one hundred and twenty li. There were many date stacks in the garden, which were verdant and lovely. Each mu of dates could yield one dan, which was worth seventeen yuan last year. In total, the entire garden weighed 300 catties when wet. In terms of agricultural byproducts, it accounted for a large income. There were about 400 households, with a population of about 1700. Each family lived near their fields. There was a complete primary school and five or six private schools. There were a total of 300 students in public and private schools, accounting for about half of the school-age children. Public schools did not charge tuition fees, and many children from poor families attended them. Private schools charged a regular annual fee of three yuan per person, plus gifts for the four major festivals, as well as miscellaneous fees for ink and paper (2 mao), charcoal (2 mao), incense oil (1 catty), and rice and flour (1 sheng), totaling about six yuan per year. Villagers were superstitious about private schools, praising that "those who are familiar with the Four Books and proficient in the Five Classics do not read textbooks but understand everything." Therefore, they rushed to private schools and did not mind paying high fees. Moreover, many students in public schools had also read the Four Books, so they were older and taller, like middle school students.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Zaoyuan and went to choose a shop, every household was eating dinner. The main food was a basket of wild vegetables, a bowl of noodle soup or mung bean soup, a pot of vinegar, and a plate of salt. Only one in ten people ate steamed buns or porridge. Wild vegetables, often called "bitter bitter vegetables," were the main food among the main foods. Their shape was very similar to poppies and dandelions. Cooked and dipped in vinegar, they still tasted bitter. Young children did not eat it, stopped their chopsticks, and cried. Grain merchants from other counties were often robbed. Local merchants were killed if they were robbed. The bandits wore masks and painted their faces, and were mostly local starving people. It can be seen that there was money to buy a good harvest, but the people had no food. The miserable situation was like this. The calamities of war were even worse than words could describe.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Water Level of the Yellow River in Shandong Rises Sharply: Water Level Reaches Over 28.19 Meters; Zhang Lianjia Goes to Inspect River Works in the Middle Reaches <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The water level of the Yellow River in Shandong is currently in a major flood period. It has continued to rise for days, and it is gradually entering a critical stage. Flood prevention work in all sections is also becoming increasingly tight. Moreover, there have been heavy rains in the upstream area of Shanzhou for days, and the water level has risen sharply. Huge waves and currents are flowing down rapidly. According to a report from Luokou from the Shandong River Affairs Bureau on the 5th, the water level was still 27.48 meters. Today (the 6th), at 6:00 AM, the bureau received another report, stating that from the evening of the 5th to 6:00 AM this morning (the 6th), the river water rose sharply, and the flow was fierce. The water level increased by 7.1 gongcun in just a few hours, reaching 28.19 meters, and is still rising. Fortunately, the condition of the river works in the upper, middle, and lower reaches is still stable, and there have been no major incidents. After receiving the report, Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, feared that the water level would change and cause dangerous works. In addition to ordering the flood prevention sections and county chiefs along the river to step up defenses, he set off by car from Jinan at 2:00 PM today (the 6th) to inspect the middle reaches. After leaving Jinan, Zhang first traveled west along the south bank, passing through the Lijiasi section, Zhuangyangzhuang, Handao Pass, Caojiazhuang, and Zhangzhuang, and arrived at Beidianzi, which is the junction of the first and second main sections of the south bank. After a brief inspection, Zhang crossed the river from Beidianzi to Qihe on the north bank to check the river works. Then, he traveled east along the embankment from Qihe, passing through Wangzhuang, Yue Zhuang, Xi Daokou, Li Jiaan, Zhao Zhuang, Qiu Jiaan, Liu Jiamiao, Wang Jia Kiln, Zhu Heyuan, and Ding Jiakou, and arrived at Luokou. All of the above are located in the third section of the north bank. After completing the inspection, he set off from Luokou and returned to Jinan at 7:30 PM. According to Zhang, the river works in the middle reaches were all in good condition during this trip. Now, because of the heavy rain in the upstream area of Shanzhou, the water level has risen sharply and is flowing downstream. Fortunately, the newly built embankments are not in danger. According to another source, the water level of the Yellow River rose by more than three gongchi this afternoon (the 6th), totaling more than one meter since yesterday, which is more than three Chinese feet. The water level reached 28.3 meters this afternoon and is still rising. However, it is still more than three meters below the highest water level last year. Judging from the current situation, other unexpected incidents are unlikely to occur. Regarding the newly emerged dangerous work in the lower reaches of Lijin Gongjiadong, it has been actively repaired by the river defense personnel and can be considered safe. Fortunately, although the river滩 was washed away by the torrent, it has not yet reached the base of the embankment. Because there is another滩 dam inside the main embankment, which is the dangerous work that was washed away by the water this time. If it is not repaired urgently, it will be very dangerous. It is reported that Pan Jianfen, the chief of the engineering section of the bureau, set off yesterday (the 5th) and has arrived at the work site to supervise the emergency repairs. As for the restoration situation, stones are being placed first, so no matter how large the water flow is, it will not affect the work. Pan now plans to return to Jinan tomorrow (the 7th) because the dangerous work has been completed. In addition, Liang Jinming, the chief of the downstream section, came to Jinan from the flood area a few days ago to meet with Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, to report on the dangerous situation in the downstream area. Liang is scheduled to return to the downstream work section tomorrow (the 7th) after completing his official duties in Jinan to oversee all matters. All work sections along the river have now been carefully defended to avoid negligence. (6th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since the Red Bandits were subjected to five encirclement campaigns by the National Army, their military has failed and their economy has fallen into bankruptcy. According to the confession of Ren Wenkui, a document officer from the False Third Division, announced by the Military Headquarters, they are showing signs of total collapse. His confession is as follows: (A. General Situation of the Bandit Area: 1. The people in the bandit area have been subjected to various oppressions by the bandits recently, and there is no way to escape, resulting in many people committing suicide by throwing themselves into wells or hanging themselves. The situation is chilling to witness. 2. The farmers are even more impoverished than before. Each person only receives three or four dan of grain per year and must also bear the burden of public bonds, war expenses, and membership fees. They work hard year-round but cannot make ends meet. Men are forced to become soldiers, and women are oppressed to farm the land. Each person must also pay three sheng of rice per month to send to the front lines. The people dare to be angry but dare not speak out. They wish for the time of their destruction. 3. Workers have no work to do. The number of unemployed has reached over 90%. 4. The bandit area has a national bank that issues banknotes, divided into five denominations: one yuan, five jiao, two jiao, one jiao, and five fen. Five yuan is equivalent to one silver dollar. There are also self-made small silver coins of two hao and one hao. Eighteen hao are equivalent to one silver dollar. Each paper yuan can only buy two or three liang of salt. The high cost of other goods can be imagined. Therefore, the general life is extremely difficult. B. Military Aspect: 1. The main force of the bandits is the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th Army Corps. Each army corps has three divisions, each division has three regiments, and each regiment has about 500 to 600 people. There are about 300 to 400 guns, and the rest are spearmen. Each soldier has a maximum of seven or eight rows of bullets, and only one-tenth of the guns have bayonets. There are very few hand grenades. 2. The bandits have suffered many failures, and there have been many deaths, injuries, and desertions. Now, the people in the bandit area are all required to join the Red Army. Those under 25 are designated as Young Pioneers, and those over 25 are organized into Model Battalions and Red Guards. Communist Party members are assigned to train them, falsely claiming to protect their homeland, but they are soon sent to the front lines as replacements. There is now talk of expanding the 4th and 12th Army Corps and expanding the Red Army by 50,000. C. Material Aspect: 1. Ammunition is scarce. The bandit leaders once ordered all villages to search for broken copper and scrap iron to prepare for self-manufacturing, but for several months, no one has complied. Recently, only ten dan of scrap iron has been collected in Yudu, which is of no help. The ordnance factory in Yudu can only repair weapons due to a lack of raw materials and cannot manufacture them. 2. Supply is difficult. It is now stipulated that each bandit soldier receives eight liang of rice per day (six liang for dry rice and two liang for porridge). Although a small amount of salt can be transported in from western Fujian, the supply cannot meet the demand, resulting in many soldiers having no salt to eat. 3. Other: I. Bandit soldiers have no clothes to wear, no blankets to cover themselves, and no medicine to treat injuries. Many want to defect. II. Because surveillance is very strict, there is no opportunity to take advantage of. III. Local armed forces such as guerrillas are more likely to defect. IV. Currently, in order to maintain the emergency situation, the bandits are collecting old silver coins from various places to manufacture fake foreign coins and organizing a trade bureau to send people to buy materials from the Central Army and local areas to provide relief.

<p>Beijing Dispatch: The Supreme Court held its annual meeting and administrative meeting yesterday. The meeting was held downstairs in the newly built library of the court. The secretariat had made some arrangements beforehand. The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. Guests included Xie Guansheng and Pan Enpei, secretaries and counselors of the Judicial Yuan, Mao Zuquan, president of the Administrative Court, and Zheng Lie, chief prosecutor of the Procuratorate, as well as the presidents, judges, chief clerks, and section chiefs of the civil and criminal courts of the court, totaling about 80 people. It was led by Court President Ju Zheng, who performed the ceremony as usual and delivered an opening speech, elaborating on the state of the judiciary in China. Next, Xie Guansheng gave a speech on the progress of the court's work in recent years, which was very detailed. After 10:00 AM, the annual meeting continued, chaired by Mr. Ju, and resolved many important cases, such as the allocation of duties for court presidents and judges of the court in 1934. It was originally scheduled to hold the administrative meeting immediately after the annual meeting, but because the weather was very hot in the afternoon and the attendees were sweating profusely, and the original work of the attendees had been slightly suspended due to the meeting, it was changed to continue at 8:00 AM today (the 8th). Today is a Sunday holiday, but because the meeting was very important for the reform of court affairs, it was still held by the chairman after consulting the opinions of the public, and all members attended. It is said that many important administrative cases were resolved. After the meeting, Court President Ju held a dinner for all the members in recognition of their hard work and to promote conversation. (8th)</p>

<p>The collection of national taxes in this county is the responsibility of the first and second collection offices, which are divided according to the former jurisdictions of the Hua and Lou counties. Ye Runchun, the director of the first collection office, has held office for many years. Recently, he was suddenly accused by someone, and the Party Headquarters sent personnel to the county to check the accounts and ordered him to create a register for verification within a limited time. Mr. Ye also submitted his resignation, which was approved by the county government. Yang Yunwen was selected to take over the position and took over yesterday (the 8th). However, the accusations against Director Ye will probably not end easily.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, there has been a severe drought and no rain. The weather has been extremely hot. The temperature in the room has reached a maximum of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Strong winds have blown during the day, suddenly turning cool. However, due to the erratic and variable weather, epidemics have been prevalent in the four townships. The day before yesterday, fifteen people died in Jinping Township in the sixth district in one day. The epidemic is rampant and continues to spread.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Wuxi: Drought Disaster Approaching, Relief Efforts Intensifying <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>This year's severe drought has already manifested as a disaster. At Zhangjing Bridge, only 30% of farmers are transplanting rice seedlings, while 70% are sitting and waiting. A small number, seeing no hope for rice cultivation, are switching to planting soybeans. Around Yangming Township, due to its proximity to Taihu Lake, 70% have already transplanted seedlings. However, due to the intense heat and lack of rain, the seedlings are developing slowly and mostly withering and turning yellow. The northern townships of Shitangwan and Luoshe are also suffering from severe drought and difficulty in drawing water. Therefore, they have gathered hundreds of farmers by gong to dredge the river at locations such as Li Kou, Qin Jia Zhuang Bridge, and Lin Bang Tou, diverting water from the Grand Canal to irrigate the fields. However, this can only temporarily save the already transplanted fields. The higher, unirrigated fields cannot be saved. On average, only 20-30% of the county has been able to transplant seedlings. If it doesn't rain again, even the already transplanted seedlings will wither and die, and the drought disaster will become immediately apparent. Currently, the farmers' worries are evident on their faces. In the Xicang area of the Second District, due to the drying up of the river, over 10,000 mu of farmland are likely to become completely barren. Therefore, Ji Guoyong, the Standing Committee member of the Fifth Branch of the Northern Jiangsu Experimental District in that area, instructed the Xicang Improvement Association to urge farmers to first pump water from the Grand Canal into the riverbank and then irrigate the fields. However, the project is massive and requires an estimated cost of over a thousand yuan, which cannot be raised immediately. The local villagers went to Changzhou to petition the county magistrate, Cai Ziping (who is from Xicang). Cai returned to his hometown the day before yesterday and convened a meeting with the district head, Yuan Yongshang, and others. As a result, it was decided to organize a pumping water committee for six townships, including Xicang, and appoint seven people, including Cai Zixing and Ji Guoyong, as committee members. Ten motorboats will be hired to pump water for disaster relief, with the costs shared by the farmers. Cai Ziping will be responsible for guaranteeing a temporary loan of 1,200 yuan from the Farmers Bank.</p>

<p>The Dalai Rice Mill, located below Huai De Bridge in Ximenwai, Wuyi County, caught fire at 1:00 PM on the 8th due to overheating of the engine steam pipe in the rear workshop. The fire quickly became extremely fierce. Although all the workers tried their best to extinguish it, it was difficult to put out because the river water was shallow. Later, fire brigades from various districts arrived to help, but most of the buildings had already been burned down. The fire was finally extinguished after about an hour. An investigation after the incident revealed that twenty-one workshop buildings and flour milling machinery were completely destroyed, resulting in significant losses.</p>

<p>The Director of the Education Bureau in this county was previously concurrently held by County Magistrate Bi Jingqian. Now, due to the heavy burden of official duties, he is unable to continue in that role. He has resigned to the provincial government and recommended Gui Yinwu to fill the position. The Provincial Department of Education has approved the request and specially appointed Mr. Gui to take over. It is reported that the new director took office and affixed his seal yesterday.</p>

<p>The provincial government has sent officials to Nantong and detained Chen Youqi, the head of Yu Dong District, and Ding Ziyan, the head of Yi Yu District, at the county government. Meanwhile, the county police force was dispatched to Yu Dong to surround the militia's firearms in Tangjiagou. The militia has made significant contributions to suppressing bandits and communists in the eastern townships in recent years, and all firearms have been inspected and branded. They refused to surrender their weapons, leading to a conflict between the two sides. Subsequently, mediation by local gentry resulted in the weapons not being surrendered for the time being. The militia turned over Tang Dazong, Jiang Zhaoxian, Tang Caizong, and Tang Xianchen to the city. On the 8th, they were sent to the provincial capital together with the two district heads, Chen and Ding, under the provincial order.</p>

<p>Due to the severe drought and lack of rain, causing fields to crack and rice seedlings to wither, the Jiaxing County Government convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies and organizations yesterday to discuss drought relief. The following resolutions were made: (1) In accordance with the provincial government's telegram, 20,000 yuan of local public funds will be allocated to purchase a number of water pumps to pump water from the large river into the branch rivers. (2) The original 9,000 yuan in machine loan funds held by the Farmers Bank will be used to purchase three horsepower engines to be lent to the people. (3) Eleven committee members will be appointed to form a drought relief committee to be specifically responsible for these tasks and facilitate progress. In addition, the gentry in the city have set up an altar to pray for rain and have observed a three-day ban on slaughter. Zhongxiu Town has initiated the use of water pumps to draw water from the outer river for residents to use, which has been implemented since the 10th. Moreover, ships at Cao Ting, Puguang Temple, and Xin Zha have mostly stopped sailing due to the drought.</p>

<p>Hou Dingjiang, a farmer from Changtiaogang, Ru Ziwei, Third District, Jiaxing (originally from Jiangbei), cultivated nearly 100 mu of land and hired several workers to help with farming. Recently, due to the drought, the work of pumping water was intensified. Yesterday, a certain worker, exhausted and slack, was overly reprimanded by the landlord. In anger, the worker asked for a half-day break, which was refused, leading to a quarrel and then a physical fight. The worker struck Hou's waist with great force, causing serious injuries. He died that evening. The crowd arrested the murderer and reported the incident for an autopsy and punishment of the perpetrator.</p>

<p>The Yangliu Motor Road has been rushed to completion, and the construction of bridges and culverts is now actively underway. Construction has reached No. 141 at the Meijiagou site north of Xincheng in Yi County. This section of the river channel supplies water to the farmland, so a culvert needs to be built. The construction of a dam is currently underway, but around 3:00 PM on the 7th, suddenly over a hundred villagers came to block the dam construction, claiming that the culvert was too small and would obstruct the flow of river water to irrigate hundreds of miles of farmland in this township. If the water source is blocked and narrowed, it will greatly affect the farmland. The group demanded that the culvert be rebuilt as a bridge and dismantled the constructed dam on their own, preventing further construction. They intend to go to the county government to file a petition.</p>

<p>The book "Gossip about Yangzhou" written by Yi Junzuo, the compilation and review director of the Jiangsu Education Department, is considered by the people of Yangzhou to be deliberately slandering and insulting them, leading to unanimous opposition. It is now learned that the movement has expanded. The Jiangdu Women's Association believes that the insults to women in the book are particularly severe. Therefore, in accordance with Article 325, Paragraph 2, and Article 328 of the Criminal Law, Chairman Guo Jianren has been designated to file a private prosecution with the Zhenjiang District Court, scheduled to be heard on the 11th. A declaration has been issued to hold a citizens' assembly, and various small steamship companies have specially prepared six free ships to transport the public to the provincial capital to petition.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Commemoration of the Northern Expedition Pledge Ceremony: All Sectors Held a Commemorative Meeting Yesterday. Over One Hundred Representatives from All Sectors Attended. Tao Baichuan Reported on the Significance of the Commemoration. <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's pledge to launch the Northern Expedition. Representatives from all sectors of the city gathered at the City Party Headquarters auditorium at 9:00 AM to hold a commemorative meeting. Those present included Tao Baichuan from the City Party Headquarters, Xiong Lixian from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Li Zemin from the City Public Security Bureau, Qiu Yunming from the Land Bureau, Wang Zongjian from the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, Zhou Feicheng from the City Education Association, Yu Zhenhui from the City Farmers' Association, Lin Kecong from the Women's National Goods Year Movement, Pan Rongting from the South Shanghai District Farmers' Association, Xu Chonghua from the Chinese Youth Association, Li Shiyong from the City Cooperative Business Promotion Association, Yu Jiugao from the Wharf Business Office, Yin Yong from the Youth Propaganda Team, Wu Jianzhi from the Anhui Association of Students in Shanghai, Chen Bangyan from New Asia Middle School, Zhang Jingyi from the Patriotic Girls' School, Li Julin from Jiangjing Elementary School, Yin Zhiren from Cheng Elementary School, and over two hundred representatives from various institutions, organizations, schools, and party headquarters. After performing the ceremonial rites, Chairman Tao Baichuan gave a report, stating that the Republic of China has two important commemorative dates: October 10th and July 9th. The former is the National Day, and the latter is the Restoration Day. Without October 10th, China would not have today's democratic republic. However, without the Northern Expedition launched on July 9th to restore the Republic of China, the country would no longer be a country, and even a democratic republic would not have much significance. The reason why the July 9th Northern Expedition was able to achieve the effect of restoring China was primarily because of the guidance of the Three Principles of the People, the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the sacrifice and struggle of loyal and brave soldiers, the planning and assistance of the Chinese Kuomintang Party Headquarters, and the practical cooperation of the people. With these five reasons, the Northern Expedition was able to be completed quickly. However, we should understand that the completion of the Northern Expedition is only the beginning of the revolution, not the completion of the revolution. The completion of the Northern Expedition is still far from the completion of the revolution, because the revolution of the Three Principles of the People, in terms of nationalism, requires the abolition of unequal treaties in order to seek equality in international status; in terms of democracy, it requires the implementation of local self-government in order to seek equality in political status; and in terms of people's livelihood, it requires equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital in order to seek equality in economic status. All of this cannot be achieved by the Northern Expedition alone, and requires our continued efforts. Therefore, it is said that the revolution has not yet been completed, and comrades must continue to work hard. People doubt and are disappointed in the revolution because they believe that the completion of the Northern Expedition is the completion of the revolution. Therefore, we must clearly recognize this point in the future and continue the work of the revolution. The path of our efforts should first be to unite as one and build a unified, strong central government, and support and supervise it. The declaration of the Northern Expedition stated that the purpose of the Northern Expedition was to build a unified government as the foundation for overthrowing imperialism. We must strive to realize this requirement. Second, under the leadership of this unified government, we should restore the work of the military administration period, continue the work of the political tutelage period, and begin the work of the constitutional government period. However, what we call the military administration period here is external, not internal. It is aimed at international enemies and engages in national defense construction. All facilities should be centered on external military affairs in order to recover lost territories and revive the nation. At the same time, in order to seek closer cooperation from the people, we should keep our promise to formulate a constitution as scheduled, begin the constitutional government period, and continue the work of political tutelage and construction under the leadership of the elected government, in order to thoroughly complete the Three Principles of the People. If so, the achievements of the Northern Expedition will not be lost, and the Northern Expedition will be more meaningful.</p>

<p>The recent severe drought in various parts of Jiangnan has caused disasters. This year's poor harvest is a foregone conclusion. In addition, the inland river has dried up, and there are few ships, so there is a severe shortage of rice coming to Shanghai. As a result, rice merchants hoard goods and prices have risen sharply. The day before yesterday, it had risen from ten yuan to eleven yuan and two jiao. Yesterday, due to the lack of rice arrivals, it rose another six jiao, reaching eleven yuan and eight jiao per dan. The authorities have already paid attention to this, it is said.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been no rain in the Jiangzhe area for a long time, and drought conditions have appeared. In North China, the water levels of rivers such as the Yellow River, Luan River, and Yongding River are rising daily. The dikes in the Xiang River basin in Hubei have also been washed away, and there is a risk of flooding. It is reported that various charity organizations in the city are deeply concerned about this.

<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Northwest route was suspended more than a year ago due to the war in Xinjiang Province. The company believes that the war in the province has ended and that the Eurasia joint transportation needs to be completed urgently. Therefore, Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company, sent a telegram to Sheng Shicai, the local authority of the province, requesting the Eurasia aircraft to reach Dihua and Tacheng in order to complete the Eurasia route as soon as possible. Li also planned to personally discuss all matters related to the resumption of flights. It has been more than a month since the telegram was sent, and inquiries have been made, but no reply has been received. Therefore, the company sent another telegram to inquire the day before yesterday. Once a reply is received, Li will fly to Dihua to meet with Sheng to discuss the resumption of flights. If no reply is received, the situation will be reported to the Ministry of Transportation for instructions so that the Eurasia route can be completed as soon as possible. The China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route has been suspended for a month due to a plane crash. The company is now actively preparing to resume flights in order to facilitate passengers because the transportation between Shanghai and Guangdong is very busy. As for the two new aircraft ordered from the United States, they are already on their way and will arrive in Shanghai for assembly at the end of this month. Therefore, the resumption date will be at the beginning of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Tianjin Municipality: Concurrent Levy of Business Tax on Floating Capital; Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Ministry of Finance to Request Rectification <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing to request the Ministry to instruct the Tianjin Municipal Business Tax Collection Office to rectify the concurrent levy of business tax on floating capital. The original telegram stated (omitting titles): “Upon investigating the business tax in this city since its implementation, the investigation and taxation have often been uneven, leading to disputes over the years. The most serious issue is the treatment of floating capital, which is of utmost importance. Floating capital originally belongs to the commercial transactions of shops, representing temporary loans that are repaid later. It is fundamentally different from fixed capital and public reserve funds and should not be included in capital taxation. However, the Tianjin Municipal Business Tax Collection Office insists that floating capital is used for business purposes and invokes the collection regulations of provinces and cities such as Pingjin, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, all of which explicitly stipulate taxation. Despite repeated arguments, no effect has been achieved. Such forced analogies and arbitrary references are unreasonable. In addition to continuing to strongly argue, this matter concerns the interests of merchants nationwide. We specifically telegraph your association, hoping you will investigate and promptly telegraph the Ministry of Finance to quickly rectify and stop this practice.” Accordingly, we respectfully submit this telegram to your ministry for review, earnestly requesting prompt approval for the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance to rectify this issue to resolve disputes. With utmost sincerity, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce respectfully submits this.”</p>
<h3 id="e117">Domestic Cement Prices Drop to Promote Sales; Daily Sales Exceed 5,000 Barrels; More Than Double the Previous Amount <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Since the aggressive dumping of foreign cement in our country, the domestic cement industry has suffered severe setbacks. Recently, Chinese merchants have collectively reduced prices to compete and counter foreign goods. Since the beginning of summer, sales have suddenly become brisk. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unified Price Reductions: According to sources in the cement industry, domestic cement manufacturers have uniformly reduced prices to compete with foreign cement. Elephant brand is sold for $6.30 per barrel, Horse brand for $6.25, and sack heads for $2.45 per bag. Foreign cement companies are also considering following suit. However, many wholesalers secretly increase the marked price slightly or offer lower prices.</p>
<p>Brisk Sales: According to Mr. Wang of the National Cement Industry Federation, speaking to a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao, cement sales have suddenly surged since the beginning of summer. The original sales volume was only 2,000 to 3,000 barrels per day, but recently it has skyrocketed to 5,000 to 6,000 barrels, an increase of more than double. Cement companies like Qixing Huashang are experiencing a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The reason for the brisk sales is that many provinces are actively engaged in constructing highways, bridges, and various construction projects, leading to a surge in orders from Shanghai cement factories, resulting in this large sales volume.</p>

<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, upon returning from an inspection of industries in Nanyang, immediately began actively planning to develop the Nanyang market for domestic goods. According to sources from the International Trade Bureau, Minister Chen is most concerned about the outward development of domestic goods.

If this measure is implemented, it will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Minister Chen has now commissioned He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, to be responsible for carrying out this task. The purpose of the development is to promote the sale of our country's excellent local products as much as possible. The Ministry has formulated four principles to be implemented step by step: (1) Standardization of production; (2) Reduction of costs; (3) Attention to international market conditions; (4) Focus on international promotion. After receiving the order, the International Trade Bureau will convene domestic goods manufacturers in this city to discuss implementation methods according to the principles set by the Ministry.</p>

<h3 id="e122">After the Implementation of the Savings Bank Law, the Rural Economy is Expected to Recover <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Current Funds in Various Banks Amount to 60 Million Circulating in Rural Areas</p>
<p>Banking Circles Studying Methods to Form a Rural Lending Syndicate</p>
<p>The Savings Bank Law has been passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government on July 4th. Article 8 of the law stipulates that savings banks' collateral loans to rural cooperatives and loans secured by agricultural products shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. A reporter from the Shen Shi News inquired with banking circles yesterday. There are currently sixteen savings banks and ordinary banks that also handle savings deposits in Shanghai. As of the end of 1933, their total deposits amounted to 263.521 million yuan. Combined with the deposits received by other financial institutions that do not have specialized savings departments, the total should not be less than 300 million yuan. One-fifth of this amount is 60 million yuan. After the implementation of this law, savings banks will have significant development in lending to cooperatives, agricultural warehouses, and agricultural mortgage lending in various regions. The cash that has concentrated in urban areas in recent years may thus flow back to rural areas, which may bring hope for the recovery of the financially depleted rural economy. However, the banking circles are currently engaged in practical and organizational research on how various banks can cooperate to achieve real results. According to the proposal of Mr. Jin Guobao of the Bank of Communications, a rural lending cooperative syndicate should be organized by various banks to formulate a comprehensive plan for various provinces and regions, to avoid the drawbacks of competitive lending by various banks, and to extend to remote provinces, without being biased towards the southeast region.</p>

<p>Since the meeting passed the resolutions, the Aviation Association office immediately started this work. According to news from the office yesterday, this work is likely to be extended due to the urgency of the time and the rush in procedures.

<p>Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company’s Share Subscription is Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Construction began construction of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway in sections, starting on April 20th of this year. The road surface of the entire line, more than 200 li, has been paved. Bridges across rivers are now being actively constructed. The long-distance bus company, organized by Shanghai and Wuxi gentry and merchants, is seeing very enthusiastic share subscriptions. Details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Pavement Completed <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The designated route of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway starts from Baoshan Road in Shanghai, passing through Zhenru, Nanxiang, Jiading, Taicang, Changshu, to Wuxi, with a total length of more than 230 li for the trunk road. There is another branch line from Changshu to Suzhou, which is more than 80 li. After the Provincial Department of Construction raised sufficient funds by pre-paying road rental fees to the Shanghai banking group and the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company Preparatory Office, construction began in sections. The pavement at each station is laid with coal cinder and yellow sand and has been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Bridge Construction <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, there are more than 80 large and small bridges at various stations along the entire line. The bridges from Shanghai to Kunshan were started simultaneously during the paving of the road surface, and most have been completed. However, the bridges across the rivers in the two sections from Wuxi to Changshu and from Suzhou to Changshu on the branch road are still under construction. Because the highway bridges are intended for future use by buses, the construction must be solid, so the implementation of the project is more time-consuming and difficult. It is expected to be completed by the end of July.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Enthusiastic Subscription <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>

<h3 id="e134">Committee Meeting of the County Anti-Smoking Association; Regulations for the Number and Grades of Opium Paste Shops in Each District <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai County Anti-Smoking Committee has handled the registration of opium paste shops and smoking houses. As of the end of June, the registered establishments include two opium paste shops and one smoking house in Minhang; one opium paste shop and one smoking house in Maqiao. In addition, 19 smokers have voluntarily requested to quit smoking and have been sent to Shanghai hospitals for treatment. The committee held its fourth meeting yesterday, chaired by Chairman Pan Zhongjia. The chairman first reported on the progress, and then discussed various proposals. (1) The county's smokers have been successively applying for the registration of opium paste shops according to the number and grade of establishments. It is proposed to review and approve this first, so that it can be submitted for registration. (2) How many smoking houses should be set up in the county, and how should the location be reviewed and approved for application? Resolution: Both proposals were discussed together. It was resolved that (1) Each district should apply to set up one opium paste shop, with a maximum of two. Minhang is designated as Grade C, and the other districts are designated as Grade D. (2) Most of the county's residents are poor. Each town in the township where the market is located may set up one or two smoking houses. Minhang is designated as Grade B, and the others are designated as Grade C. (3) Investigate the smokers in each district, and propose to extend the deadline for completion of the investigation to before July 15. Resolution: Passed, and the Public Security Bureau is instructed to instruct the sub-bureaus and stations to report within the deadline. (4) How should the anti-smoking campaign be continued during the prescribed period for smoker registration? Resolution: Print and distribute the anti-smoking regulations for widespread publicity. At the same time, issue separate orders to each district and the Public Security Bureau to conduct thorough publicity. Also, a temporary motion was proposed by the chairman for deliberation: Should the committee send personnel to Shanghai hospitals to visit smokers who voluntarily requested to quit smoking? Resolution: The meeting will send personnel to investigate and offer condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Yu-Ping Railway; Groundbreaking Ceremony Held for the Yu-Nan Section; More Than 300 Representatives from All Sectors Attended; After the Meeting, a Visit to the Recovered Bandit Area <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Yu-Ping Railway, jointly planned by the Ministry of Railways and the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, has been fully planned after a long period of preparation and design. It has been decided to build the section from Yushan to Nanchang first. The groundbreaking ceremony was held in Yushan at 9:00 AM today (the 8th). Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, Zhao Guantao, Commander of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Fujian-Anhui Border Region Garrison, Zheng Hua, representative of the Ministry of Railways, and more than 300 representatives from the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces and Shanghai Xinkai Community attended. The ceremony was presided over by Zeng Yangfu. In the afternoon, Commander Zhao Guantao hosted various sectors to visit the recovered bandit area in Shangrao, returning to Yushan at about 8:00 PM. At 9:00 PM, a special train returned to Hangzhou. The details are recorded as follows: ▲Ceremony Order: The groundbreaking ceremony was held at 9:00 AM, with the following order: (1) All stand in solemnity; (2) Bow three times to the party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (3) The chairman respectfully reads Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will; (4) Silent tribute; (5) The chairman delivers a speech; (6) The director reports; (7) The commander gives instructions; (8) Guest speeches; (9) Groundbreaking; (10) Photography.</p>
<p>▲Ceremony Site Arrangement: The venue was set up at the end point of the Hangzhou-Yushan section, with a temporary thatched shed built, decorated with green pine trees and flowers, which was quite magnificent. A horizontal banner was hung at the entrance of the venue (Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Yu-Nan Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway), with a pair of couplets on the left and right, which read (Thousands of miles begin with one step, leveling mountains and determining rivers, opening up wastelands; a line connects Zhejiang and Jiangxi, galloping with the speed of wind and electricity, all things shine together). In the center was the chairman's stage, with seats for news reporters below. A horizontal white cloth banner was hung above (The Great Way is Public), and a couplet was also hung on the left and right, which read (Start operating bravely and forge ahead; rely on the vehicles to assist each other and promote the same customs).</p>
<p>▲Attendees: The attendees included Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department and Chairman of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council; Zheng Hua, representative of the Ministry of Railways; Yang Jinzhong, representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Government; Lu Xian, Director of the Civil Affairs Department and representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Government; Li Chukuang, representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department; Yu Baiqing, representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department; Wu Jiantao, Director of the Jiangxi Finance Department and Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council; Xiao Chunjin, member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council; Guo Su, Administrative Inspector of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Fujian-Anhui Border Region; Huo Baoshu, representative of the Bank of China in Shanghai; Shou Yicheng, representative of the Bank of China of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce; Hou Jiayuan, Deputy Director of the Nanjing-Jiangxi Railway Bureau; and more than 300 people, including representatives from newspapers in Shanghai and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Speech: After the meeting began according to the agenda, Chairman Zeng Yangfu delivered a speech, saying that today is the groundbreaking ceremony for the Yu-Nan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and he is very grateful to the leaders and groups for coming in the heat. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is a company in name and organization, but its nature is owned by the government, which should be noted. Railways are important transportation undertakings, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen emphasized them in his nation-building strategy. However, Chinese people have always considered railway construction to be extremely difficult, believing that it cannot be operated without foreigners. Since the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, this kind of fear of difficulty has been swept away. From a technical point of view, some people also doubt that Chinese railways will inevitably lose money and dare not invest. However, if management is proper, there is no reason to lose money. Seeing the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the doubts can be dispelled. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway's business is based on commercial principles, eliminating all waste and uneconomical expenditures, and for employees, talent is used as the standard, giving them real protection, so that they can work with peace of mind. This is the spirit of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway in the past and present. The mission of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is even more important. After the devastation of Jiangxi Province by the communist bandits, the restoration of the local economy cannot be achieved without the completion of this road. As for national defense and transportation, it goes without saying. I hope the government and the people will support it.</p>
<p>▲Director's Report: Next, Deputy Director Hou Jiayuan gave a report, saying that the groundbreaking ceremony for this road has been held three times. The first time was in Xiaoshan in 1930, with the purpose of making Xixing directly reach Lanxi. The second time was in Lanxi in 1932, with the purpose of extending from Jinhua to Yushan. Today is the third time, with the purpose of extending this road to Nanchang. At that time, because of the difficulty in raising funds, I never thought that it could become an important railway connecting Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Since the preparations for this road began in May, it has been divided into sixteen sections, of which twelve have been surveyed. The remaining four sections need to wait for one or two weeks after the communist bandits have been wiped out before they can start. The total length of this road is more than 300 kilometers, with a cost of 16 million yuan. It is expected to be completed by the end of next year.</p>
<p>▲Railway Chief's Instructions: Next, Zheng Hua, the representative of the Ministry of Railways, delivered instructions on behalf of Minister Gu, saying that today is the groundbreaking ceremony for the Yu-Nan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways, due to official duties, sent Zheng Hua to participate in the ceremony as a representative. Now, I will follow the instructions of the minister and briefly reiterate the significance and expectations of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. In the past, the trend of railway construction in our country focused on the north of the Yangtze River, and the vertical and horizontal trunk lines have now been roughly prepared. In the south of the Yangtze River, the Yuehan Railway is the only important trunk line connecting north and south. Now we are rushing to repair the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section, and it is expected to complete the entire line and open it to traffic by 1936. As for the southeastern trunk line, it was originally planned to build the Ningxiang Line, but it could not be realized due to other reasons. Recently, it was decided to use the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and extend it to become the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, connecting Zhejiang and Jiangxi, reaching Hunan and Anhui, and becoming one of the east-west trunk lines. In the future, after the entire road is completed, it will have great relations with military, political, cultural, and economic aspects, and its position in transportation, connecting to the Yuehan Railway in the west and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway in the east, is no less than a central communication line. The importance can be imagined. Although the construction of the Yu-Nan section is being carried out first due to limited financial resources, it is hoped that the engineering, management, and accounting systems will be handled in accordance with the standards and regulations set by the Ministry to achieve consistency. At the same time, there are also expectations: 1. For the completed lines of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the bridges, steel rails, etc. that are not suitable for joint transportation are urgently hoped to be gradually reformed to make their carrying capacity equal to the state-owned railways connected, so that it will be convenient for joint transportation in the future. 2. For the section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang to the west, it is hoped that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Company will find a way to raise the required construction funds as soon as possible in accordance with the original capital amount, so that it can continue when the Yu-Nan section is completed, and the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Yuehan Railway can be completed and opened to traffic at the same time. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company is a unique organization created in response to the central government, local governments, and the financial community, with the Council as the highest executive body. The Council Chairman and others are working hard to build and are specialized talents. It can be foreseen that they will work together with one heart and each show their strengths to establish excellent achievements, which can be congratulated in advance. On the occasion of the groundbreaking, I respectfully deliver my speech. Finally, Wu Jiantao, Yu Baiqing, Xiao Chunjin, Li Chukuang, Zhao Guantao, Huo Baoshu, and others spoke in succession, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 for photography.</p>
<p>▲Visit to the Bandit Area: At about 1:00 PM, Zhao Guantao, Commander of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Fujian-Anhui Border Region Garrison, in order to allow all sectors to understand the situation in the recovered bandit area, specifically invited Zeng Yangfu, Huo Baoshu, Li Chukuang, news reporters from Shanghai and Hangzhou, and guests from all sectors to visit Shangrao and Luoqiao. At 1:30 PM, they set off from Yushan by highway car, arriving at Shangrao City at about 30 minutes. They transferred to Luoqiao. Blockhouses were set up along the road, guarded by the People's Defense Corps organized by residents. According to Commander Zhao, Luoqiao is only 80 li from the communist bandit area, but it has been quite quiet recently. Since the central government adopted a strategy of encirclement and suppression, the communist bandits have been increasingly impoverished and unable to counterattack outwards. It is estimated that after twelve months, the communist bandits in Jiangxi can be completely wiped out. At more than 5:00 PM, the commander hosted a banquet at the Garrison Command in Shangrao City, and the guests and hosts parted happily until 7:00 PM. (Shen Shi News)</p>

<p>And telegraph to compatriots associations in various places to strive for a consistent effort</p>
<p>The Anhui Shanghai Compatriots Association telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Central Political Committee, the Ministry of Interior, the Military Committee, Commander-in-Chief Jiang of the Nanchang Forward Headquarters, and the Anhui Provincial Government yesterday regarding the Wuyuan issue, stating:</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Administrative Regions Cannot Be Easily Changed <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>I humbly believe that the establishment and alteration of administrative regions must first thoroughly consider all aspects of the area's history, geography, culture, and economy, taking the convenience of the people and the benefit of governance as the criteria. It cannot be compared to the military zoning, which is about sizing up the terrain to respond to a temporary situation. Furthermore, the boundaries of the two should not be subject to a single administration. Military actions are temporary, administrative measures are permanent, and military authority is directly under the central government. The deployment of troops, the transfer of supplies, and the planning of defense are not restricted by administrative regions.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Historical and Long-Standing Sentiments of the People of Huizhou <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since the proposal to transfer Wuyuan to Jiangxi arose, the people of Huizhou and the villagers of the county have been running around in a panic, telling each other the news. Indeed, for Wuyuan County, historically, all counties under Huizhou have been under the same administration for more than a thousand years; geographically, they are all mountainous areas belonging to the Huangshan mountain range; culturally, they are all influenced by the theories of Zhu Xi, Tao Xingzhi, Jiang Yong, and Dai Zhen; economically, the land is barren, agriculture is underdeveloped, and most people are engaged in long-distance trade. Their customs are similar, and their feelings are deep. Therefore, the fellow townsmen of Huizhou in various ports regard each other as siblings. If the county is transferred to Jiangxi, separating it from other counties under Huizhou and placing it under the same administrative organization as Dexing, Fuliang, and Leping counties, where the customs of farming on plains are robust, it will not only cause great inconvenience in life, but also political measures will likely be incompatible.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Military Operations to Suppress Bandits Should Be Unified Early <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>If some argue that it is necessary for the convenience of suppressing bandits, then the troops suppressing bandits from the three provinces and the local police are all under the command of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of our Military Affairs Commission. The troops currently stationed in Wuyuan are subordinates of the Commander-in-Chief of the Reserve Army and do not have the boundaries of Anhui and Jiangxi to begin with. Why is it necessary to change the jurisdiction in order to take advantage of the terrain and ensure a perfect defense?</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Principle of the Premier's Political Power Emphasizes Public Opinion <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>In the past, our Premier separated political power and governing power, with the former belonging to the people and the latter belonging to the government. Although we have not yet reached the constitutional era, the direction of public opinion should be sufficient for the government to consider. Therefore, based on this principle, we make a straightforward appeal, hoping that the ministries and commissions of the government will carefully consider the people's concerns and re-examine this case to benefit the people's livelihood and appease their expectations. Anhui Association in Shanghai kowtows with utmost urgency to await orders. We also send messages to the Anhui associations and prominent figures in Beijing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Suzhou, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Hankou, urging them to strive for this matter together.

<p>The Strike Committee of the British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong held its 13th meeting on the 7th, and among the resolutions was (a letter to the Great America and China-America Tobacco Companies, advising them not to manufacture products on behalf of the British-American Company before the strike is resolved, to avoid causing other problems). Yesterday, China-America received a letter from the committee and immediately replied truthfully, stating (According to the organization of our company, it is entirely Chinese-owned and has no dealings with the British-American Tobacco Company. How could we manufacture products on behalf of that company? The rumors are obviously for other purposes. We hope you will investigate in detail and not be deceived, so that the truth will be revealed). It is verified that China-America Tobacco Company is organized by purely Chinese shares, so it usually advocates domestic products and serves the society with all its efforts. Its various products are highly trusted by the society. This rumor can be refuted without attacking it.</p>

<p>Shen Mingming, a local resident and head of the local patrol residing in a bungalow without a number on Ninghe Road, is 52 years old. Previously, Xu Guiying, a detective from the Narcotics Division, learned that he was selling red pills for profit. He sent an informant to buy them, each time for 20 cents, for a total of three times, amounting to three small packets. At noon on May 25th, he and the western patrol leader, Pat Pu, went to the address and arrested Shen. They also found four medium-sized packets of red pills in a bamboo basket under the eaves of the house. They were all taken to the Yangshupu Police Station and sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Shen Mingming was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shen refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyer Zhang to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. After deliberation, a date was set for the pronouncement of the verdict. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Cheng personally presided over the First Criminal Court and ruled that Shen Mingming's appeal was rejected and that the original sentence would be executed.</p>

<p>Li Zhenhua, a shop assistant at the Welfare Company on Nanjing Road, colluded with Wang Atao, who had left the store, Li Linggen, and Luo Yingquan, the gatekeeper, to steal a large number of silk stockings, ties, blankets, and clothing worth more than a thousand yuan. Later, Li was caught selling stolen goods at the Tianyunlou Amusement Park. Shen Jinwen and Pang Ruiqing, detectives from the Laozha Police Station, arrested Li and found a large amount of stolen goods worth more than a thousand yuan at Li's house at No. 120 Oujia Road. They also arrested Luo, Wang, and Li. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, prosecuted them in the First Special Court under Article 338 of the Criminal Law. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Qian Hongye announced the verdict yesterday, sentencing Li Zhenhua to one year and six months of imprisonment, and Wang Atao, Li Linggen, and Luo Yingquan to one year of imprisonment each.

<p>The Lujiao Society Continues to Pray for Rain</p>
<p>More than 2,000 farmers in Pudong knelt and prayed to the Dragon King. The Shanghai Lujiao Federation, due to the severe drought and lack of rain, which has caused a disaster, has sent a special notice to the more than 70 public offices under its jurisdiction, leading them to set up altars and sincerely pray for three days and nights from the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month, hoping to move Heaven. Zhang Yichen, the chairman of the association, went to inspect each public office every day, and all were extremely devout. However, the date is approaching, and there is still no rain. A further notice was issued to continue for three days, saying: This year's severe heat is unprecedented. Now that Lesser Heat has passed, there is still no rain. Not only is the autumn harvest hopeless, but people and animals are also suffering. Such an unprecedented catastrophe is deeply pitiful. Each public office will continue for another three days. If it still does not rain, we will convene a general prayer.</p>

<p>In the Yangjing area of Pudong,绅董 and others have set up a Taoist altar in the Qinci Yangdian Temple, chanting scriptures day and night to pray. However, for several days, there has been no rain. The farmers in the four villages are all worried. Yesterday morning, more than 2,000 men and women farmers burned incense and formed a team, crowding into the Dragon King Temple at the southern end of Tangqiao Town, taking turns kneeling and praying for rain. The local gentry, Gu Jufang and others, believed that the god in the temple was in charge of rain, so they also initiated the hiring of 40 Taoist priests to set up a Taoist ceremony in the temple to pray for rain, continuously for three days, day and night. If rain is still not obtained by then, they will continue to pray, with a determination to achieve their goal. The farmers' eagerness for rain can be seen from this.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Liu Chongwu's Case Is Remanded for Retrial: Various Groups Gathered Yesterday to Discuss Assistance; Letter Requesting the Municipal Party Department to Send Personnel to Observe the Trial <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Patriotic people Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, and others, previously, out of patriotic motives, threw bombs as a warning because they saw unscrupulous merchants privately transporting enemy goods. They were subsequently arrested by the police after their actions were discovered. The initial trial sentenced them to three months of imprisonment, but the police lawyer appealed, resulting in sentences of up to twelve years of imprisonment. Now, the Supreme Court has remanded the case for retrial. Various groups in the city convened a meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday to discuss how to assist the patriots. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Resolutions <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>

Chen Binghui presided over the meeting, and Zheng Dongshan recorded the minutes. (A) Reporting matters: (1) Letters from various parties, assistance methods; (2) The Supreme Court's judgment remanding the case to the Second Branch of the High Court for retrial; (3) The situation of the families of the distressed patriots, etc. (B) Matters for discussion: (1) The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has scheduled to try the patriotic people Liu Chongwu and others at 9 a.m. on the 19th of this month, and how to assist them.

<h3 id="e154">Letter to the Municipal Party Department <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Support Association for Patriotic People in Distress, composed of various groups, sent a letter to the Municipal Party Department yesterday, requesting it to send personnel to observe the trial and uphold justice when the trial opens. The original letter stated: We are submitting this report because of distress caused by patriotic movements, long imprisonment, and no release. We humbly request that your department send personnel to observe the trial, to maintain the patriotic movement and to uphold justice. Since the groups heard that patriotic people Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, and others were in distress, after the initial trial and the租界捕房's attempt to harm the patriots and extinguish the patriotic movement, they appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, resulting in sentences of up to twelve years. Upon hearing the verdict, we were filled with indignation. Therefore, we rose up to provide just assistance. Fortunately, we submitted a report to your department, which was forwarded to the central government and approved. Now, we have received the judgment from the High Court (the original judgment regarding Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, and Cao Songshou is revoked and remanded, and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has scheduled a retrial on the morning of the 19th of this month). This shows that there is still hope for justice and that the patriots will see the light of day. We hereby submit this report truthfully, requesting your department to consider the patriotic movement and allow personnel to observe the trial, so that the spirit of fairness and justice can be achieved, and the patriots can be released. The nation will be fortunate. We respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<p>The British Yihua Company's Shanghai-Wuhan route Gongo Lun ship lost caution. After being extinguished by the Jianghai Customs fire boat, an investigation was conducted yesterday morning, and the loss was 10,000 yuan. The ship will sail to Hankou as usual tonight. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Extinguishing the Import <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>After the Gongo Lun ship lost caution and docked outside Wusongkou, the Jianghai Customs sent two fireboats and cooperated with the Shanghai Public Concession Fire Brigade for rescue. It was not completely extinguished until about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. At 10 p.m. the night before, it entered Wusongkou and originally docked at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf. Yihua Company immediately notified the cargo owner, Shen Heng Foreign Firm at 190 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Inspection Survey Yesterday Morning <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, the British Yihua Company sent personnel to the Huashun Wharf together with the cargo owner, Shen Heng Foreign Firm, and the Insurance Association for inspection. The waste cotton loaded in the fourth cargo hold was burned by the fire, and the rest was waterlogged. However, the other cargo holds were not affected, and the ship's hull was not damaged. After the inspection, a report was made and filed for future reference, so as to claim compensation from the company insuring against water and fire risks.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Starting to Unload Cargo <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The cargo loaded in the fourth cargo ship was waste cotton, totaling 1,226 pieces, all of which belonged to Shen Heng Foreign Firm. After being burned, Shen Heng Foreign Firm hired barges yesterday afternoon to unload the waterlogged waste cotton and transport it to the Longmao Wharf warehouse in Pudong for temporary storage. Because the insurance policy of the insurance company has not yet been sent from Hankou to Shanghai, it was telegraphed to Hankou yesterday morning to inquire which company insured the goods and to send the insurance policy to Shanghai as soon as possible for settlement.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Cause of the Fire <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from Yihua Company and Shen Heng Foreign Firm that the more than 1,200 pieces of waste cotton loaded in the fourth cargo hold were mostly oil cotton in the waste cotton, which is easy to catch fire. The fire started at 3 p.m. on July 7th and was not extinguished until 4 p.m. on July 8th, a total of 26 hours. The reason was that the weather was hot, and the oil cotton self-combusted due to accumulation, which was definitely not caused by leaving a cigarette butt behind.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Total Loss <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>According to the news from Shen Heng Foreign Firm, there were 1,226 pieces of waste cotton, each worth about six taels of silver, which is about 10,000 yuan. Most of them have been burned and waterlogged, and they are likely to be useless and will definitely be completely lost. As for the Gongo Lun ship, it was not damaged at all. After the cargo is unloaded, it will be scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wuhan as usual at 12 p.m. tomorrow night, stopping at all ports.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Zhang Awei, One of the "Four Great Kings" of Flower Gambling, Was Arrested; A Large Number of Flower Gambling Tickets and Gambling Funds Were Seized; Zhang Has Been Sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for Interrogation <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Although the police and detectives have repeatedly cracked down on and arrested people involved in flower gambling dens in the Zhabei area, those who are banned are banned, and those who commit offenses continue to do so. Even if they cannot establish a foothold in one place, they move to another place and set up shop, assigning their cronies to lure gamblers and profit from it, which is extremely harmful to society. A man named Zhang Awei from Ningbo, 40 years old, specializes in opening flower gambling dens and is known as the "Flower Gambling King." He is also one of the "Four Great Kings" of flower gambling in Zhabei. All flower gambling gamblers know him. He used to live in Zhabei, but because the Municipal Public Security Bureau was pursuing him very strictly, he could not establish a foothold, so he moved to the 租界. Not long after, he returned to his old ways, setting up four flower gambling listening posts and sending people to collect gambling funds and flower gambling deposit tickets from Zhabei and the South City every day. Gamblers flocked to him. Zhang Awei saw an opportunity and secretly set up a listening post in the jurisdiction of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, No. 185 Ruikang Lane, Jiaxing Road, with three betting sessions a day, involving huge amounts of money. Zhang sat back and reaped the profits. This was discovered by the director of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, who immediately led the police to the address and arrested Zhang. Another flower gambling offender, Sun Hengxiu from Shandong, was also arrested, along with a large number of flower gambling tickets and gambling funds. They were all taken back to the precinct. After interrogation, a document was prepared and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Easterner’s Mischievous Prank: Manure Placed on Beauty's Head, Yu Youxin Slapped Twice, Shen Hongbao Quickly Chased and Caught the Thug <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Shen Jianqing, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 11 Xue Alley in this city, is 55 years old. Shen has two daughters, the elder, Hongbao, is 17, and the younger, Lübao, is 14. There was a fellow named Yu Youxin, 27 years old, from Huizhou, working at the bone tile workshop at No. 5 Zhangjia Alley. Because of his short stature, people often called him "Easterner." He lived not far from the Shen family, and Yu became acquainted with Hongbao and others, often visiting them. One evening around 5 p.m. on the 7th of this month, Hongbao and Lübao, the two sisters, having just finished bathing due to the intense heat, were sitting in front of the door, trying to cool off. At that moment, Yu Youxin (nicknamed "Easterner") happened to be at the doorway, flipping through a small picture book, "(Wang Wuneng Captures Ding Guaiguai)," which Lübao saw and wanted to borrow to take a look. However, Yu refused, triggering Lübao's anger, and a quarrel ensued. Seeing this, Hongbao suddenly stepped forward and slapped Yu twice. Afterward, Yu, not to be outdone, threw a punch, and the two sides erupted into a scuffle. Neighbors came out to mediate, and the dispute subsided. But Yu was still not satisfied. He gathered more than twenty rogue acquaintances and rushed to the Shen's house, intending to drag Shen's father, Jianqing, to a teahouse for a discussion and judgment. However, Shen happened to be out and had not returned, so they couldn't find him, and they dispersed in frustration. Then, yesterday morning around 9 a.m., Hongbao was embroidering shoe uppers at the doorway when, unexpectedly, the Easterner suddenly arrived, holding a cigarette paper box filled with manure, and dumped it on her head. Hongbao was caught off guard, and her head, face, and clothes were stained with manure, emitting a foul odor. Yu took the opportunity to escape, but Hongbao took off the manure-filled box and chased after him, grabbing and restraining him. She called for Zhang Xuemin, the watchman of the 29th post, who brought him to the Second Precinct of the First District. After preliminary interrogation by Chief Liu, the case was deemed a mischievous prank, and a document was prepared and submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Son Dies for Father: Father Fails to Repay Debt, Son Driven to Suicide <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Xu Pengyun, 24 years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, is currently an apprentice at the Shanghai Wei Ye Silver Company at No. 631 Wangjia Sha, Baike Road. His father, Xu Zhihang, 46 years old, frequently travels between Shanghai and Ningbo, trading goods. Recently, he collected straw hat brims in Shanghai and transported them to Ningbo to be woven into straw hats, which he then sold in Shanghai. Xu Pengyun guaranteed all the Shanghai payments. Now, because his father has been irresponsible and has not repaid the debts, the creditors are pressing Xu Pengyun, the guarantor, for repayment. Pengyun, burdened by his father's bad behavior and unable to repay, felt driven to despair. The night before last, he bought poison and checked into Room 5 of the Yuanfa Inn at No. 13 Dongxin Bridge Street in the French Concession at 4:15 a.m. yesterday. He instructed the tea server to wake him up at 1:30 p.m., then closed the door and lay down to sleep, taking the poison and committing suicide. At 1:30 p.m. yesterday, the tea server, Yao Genfa, knocked on the door as instructed, but there was no response. Suspecting something was wrong, he pried open the door and went inside, only to find Xu dead on the bed. When Xu checked into the inn, he used the alias Xu Xianding, 22 years old, from Suzhou, a dealer in foreign goods. The inn reported the incident to the police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. Beside the deceased, several business cards were found. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for autopsy. Subsequently, according to the address on the business cards, his younger brother, Xu Guangyou, was found working as an apprentice at the Feilong Leather Goods Company at No. 4 Meibaike Road. After questioning Xu, his true name and the reason for his suicide were revealed. His father in Ningbo is still unaware that his son committed suicide due to being implicated in his debts. It is now scheduled that the Special No. 2 District Court will be notified today to send personnel for inspection, after which the family will collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Chinese Buddhist Association Requests Approval to Send Members to Various Prisons to Propagate Buddhism and Transform Inmates into Good Citizens <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Buddhist Association sent a letter to Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, saying: "President Ju Juegong, Judicial Yuan, greetings. With the arrival of spring and the renewal of governance, we respectfully admire your clear judgment and compassionate heart. Upholding the law with impartiality, just as the Lü Criminal Code, and removing the harshness of the Qin dynasty laws, with compassion and not rejoicing, we offer our reverence and wish to serve. We respectfully report that before the year of Dingmao [1927], all provincial prisons had instructors, most of whom were Buddhists. At that time, most administrators also revered Buddhism, and the results were evident. Later, due to turbulent times, this practice was discontinued. People tend to be indifferent to Buddhist teachings in times of prosperity, but they begin to realize their value after experiencing setbacks. Applying Buddhist teachings to transform those who are incarcerated, allowing them to repent, is more effective. Even after they are released from prison, they can become good citizens of society. Recognizing this, our association has already petitioned your esteemed Yuan to issue a general order to the courts of all provinces, cities, and counties, allowing Buddhist organizations to select teachers to propagate Buddhism in various prisons for the purpose of transformation. We are sending a copy of the draft to you for your review. If you grant approval, the benefits to the prisoners will be immeasurable."</p>

<p>The Taikoo Company's Changsha-bound ship "Shashi" caught fire near Changsha on its return trip from Hunan to Shanghai. The fire was extinguished on the spot. Among the goods on board, only a few pieces of podocarpus wood loaded in Changsha for Shanghai were damaged by the fire. All other goods were undamaged. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, the owner reported the incident to the company and notified the passengers. It will resume its export trip to Changsha as usual tonight.</p>

<p>Putuo, Zhejiang, is a popular summer resort, attracting many tourists in the summer. In addition to the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sending the "Pu'an" special ship, the "Xin Jiangtian" ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo line also stops at Putuo every Saturday. The six ships managed by the Lian'an Shipping Bureau – "Zhoushan," "Daxing," "Chuanshan," "Yili," "Dahua," and "Taizhou" – also started stopping at Putuo yesterday and have scheduled dates for their voyages from Shanghai to Putuo: "Zhoushan" on Mondays, "Daxing" on Tuesdays, "Chuanshan" on Wednesdays, "Yili" on Thursdays, "Dahua" on Fridays, and "Taizhou" on Saturdays. As for the Ningxing ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo line of the Sanbei Company and the Xin Ningxing ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo line of the Ning Shao Company, they will also stop at Putuo starting today. However, the Xin Beijing ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo line of the British Taikoo Company will not stop at Putuo because Putuo is not a treaty port, and foreign merchant ships are not allowed to dock there.</p>

The announcement stated: "The current tobacco and alcohol license tax has been transferred to the local government for management. The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau has been ordered to continue collecting it and has set a deadline for application and registration. Most of our tobacco and alcohol businesses do not fully understand the procedures, and we fear misunderstandings may arise if the deadline is missed.

<h3 id="e172">New Development of the Datong Music Society: Using Yuan Dynasty System to Worship Confucius <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Since the large-scale Confucius worship ceremony held in Tokyo, Japan, this spring, its unprecedented grandeur has greatly shocked people's hearts. Confucius is China's Confucius, not Japan's. If they respect him so much, then we should strive to be ahead and not lag behind. This is a definite principle. Now, our national government has issued an order the other day, setting August 27 as Confucius's birthday. With the government advocating at the top, all our people should respond at the bottom and actively participate, surpassing Japan if possible, so as not to be ashamed of the true spirit of our Chinese nation. According to research, the Confucius worship ceremony of the Yuan Dynasty was the most grand in our country's history. The number of dancers was large, and the musical instruments used included both elegant and popular styles. The dance had nine sections. The Ming and Qing dynasties only used six sections. The music score is called Dasheng Music (i.e., Zhonghe Shaoyue). The Datong Music Society in this city has been collecting it for a long time and used it once at the memorial service for the martyrs of the Shanghai War last year. It was solemn and different from the others. Now, the society plans to take advantage of this opportunity to convene all its new and old members, unite with the various national music groups in Shanghai to cooperate, and follow the Yuan Dynasty's method. In addition to the elegant musical instruments, they will also display various special musical instruments from around the world, inserting harmonies and uniformly using them to create a large-scale performance, opening up a new era for elegant music. Regarding the dance problem, they are planning to discuss it with one or two middle schools to undertake the task, with a deadline of one month for training. As for the displayed sacrificial offerings, such as grains, vegetables, fruits, livestock, game, aquatic products, etc., which are all the needs of human life passed down by the sages and on which the success or failure of politics depends, they are also planning to exhibit them all, so that the true picture of our country's five thousand years of etiquette and music can be seen. This move concerns the foundation of the nation and is by no means superficial. All of us in various circles should actively participate and contribute to this grand event, so that we will not lag behind Japan again. It is said that the society has already begun preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Gift Certificates Issued by Banks Must Be Affixed with Stamps According to Ministry Order; Bankers Association Notifies All Banks, to Be Implemented Starting Today <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The gift certificates issued by various banks in this city have never been affixed with stamps. Now, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that all must be affixed with stamps in accordance with the Stamp Tax Regulations, or they will be banned. The banks believe that this measure is unprecedented, so many are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Now, after the Bankers Association convened the 48th Executive Committee meeting for discussion, it officially notified all banks yesterday, instructing them to comply with the Ministry's order and affix stamps in accordance with the law. It is said that all banks have decided to start affixing stamps on gift certificates starting today. The original letter from the Bankers Association and the Stamp Tax Regulations are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e174">Bankers Association Letter <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Bankers Association sent a letter to various banks in this city, saying: "We are writing to inform you that according to letters from Xinhua, Chouye, and Shanghai banks, they recently received a letter from the Ministry of Finance stating that the issuance of gift certificates should be affixed with stamps in accordance with Article 2, Category 2, Item 5 of the Stamp Tax Regulations, according to the progressive tax rate. The trade has not previously affixed stamps to gift certificates. Please reply as to whether we should comply with the order. After deliberation at the 48th Executive Committee meeting of this association, it was decided that although there is no clear provision in the Stamp Tax Regulations stating that gift certificates should be affixed with stamps, after studying their nature, they are quite similar to deposit receipts, and it is not inappropriate to apply the rules by analogy. In the future, stamps should be affixed in accordance with the deposit receipt article of the Stamp Tax Regulations, without omission. We hereby notify all banks in the same industry to be informed."</p>
<h3 id="e175">Stamps to Be Affixed <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Bank gift certificates should be affixed with stamps according to the following progressive tax rates: For amounts of one yuan or more but less than ten yuan, affix a one-cent stamp; for ten yuan or more but less than one hundred yuan, affix a two-cent stamp; for one hundred yuan or more but less than five hundred yuan, affix a four-cent stamp; for five hundred yuan or more but less than one thousand yuan, affix a ten-cent stamp; for one thousand yuan or more but less than five thousand yuan, affix a twenty-cent stamp; for five thousand yuan or more but less than ten thousand yuan, affix a fifty-cent stamp; for ten thousand yuan or more but less than fifty thousand yuan, affix a one-yuan stamp; for fifty thousand yuan or more, affix a one-yuan and fifty-cent stamp; no additional stamps are required for amounts over fifty thousand yuan.</p>

<p>The dye industry has always been dominated by imported products. Most of the dyeing and weaving factories in our country use foreign goods because there are no domestic products. The annual outflow of capital is staggering, which is a major loss for our country. Mr. Dong Yuchang, an industrialist in Shanghai, founded the Dachung Dye Factory, and its vulcanized Yuanqing product can indeed compete with imported products. Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce introduced it to the chambers of commerce in various places for adoption, in order to promote domestic products. The original telegram is copied below: "To all municipal chambers of commerce across the country: We recently received a letter from Shanghai Dachung Dye Factory Co., Ltd., which reads, 'Our factory's Zhongzi trademark vulcanized Yuanqing dye is of excellent quality and low price, enough to compete with imported products and stop the outflow of capital. We have applied to the Ministry of Industry for examination and approval for exemption from production tax and forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for execution. Since its production, it has been sold to various places and has been praised and purchased by dyeing and weaving factories and dye shops. Sales have been increasing day by day. We have always admired your association's efforts in promoting domestic products, and we hereby request you to forward it to chambers of commerce across the country for introduction,' etc. We have checked and found that dyes have always been dominated by imported products in the market. Now, the factory's vulcanized Yuanqing product can indeed compete with imported products. We are enclosing samples and sending a telegram to your association, hoping that you will check and forward it to dyeing and weaving factories and dye shops for introduction and adoption, in order to promote domestic products and stop the outflow of capital. We eagerly await your response. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, bows.'"</p>

<p>On May 21st of this year, at about 9 p.m., a tragic assassination case occurred behind Zhaofeng Garden in Caojiadu. After receiving the report, the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched Deputy Squad Leader Dong Wenrui, leading detectives Wang Yixin, Yang Qing, and Wu Yihe, to rush to the</p>

<p>scene. They surrounded the area to capture the murderer, but he had already escaped. It was found that the deceased was Qiang Fugeng, over 30 years old, from Wuxi, who ran a lace shop called Zhenchangxiang on Sanma Road. The main culprit was Zhang Hanzhang, who ran a butcher shop in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu. The female culprit was Lu Wangshi, the wife of Lu Yizhang, a Cantonese man who ran a Holland water company at No. 1 Tongqing Lane, Minguo Road. Since the incident, the team has been sending personnel to investigate the suspects every day, but without any trace. Detective Squad Leader Wu Kezhong found out that Lu Wangshi's brother, Wang Shushan, often went to Lu's house at No. 1 Tongqing Lane, Xiaobeimen, to secretly communicate information. Therefore, he sent Wang Yixin to guard the place secretly. There was indeed a clue. He reported the previous situation to Captain Lu and District Chief Tan of the Sixth District, and additional detectives were sent. At about 1 p.m. the day before yesterday, they, together with the First Section of the Second District, went to No. 1 Tongqing Lane to arrest Wang Shushan, but he was not found. Only Lu Wangshi's daughter, Lu Yirong, was taken into custody. She claimed to be 12 years old. At first, she did not admit anything, but after repeated questioning, she confessed that since the incident, her mother had been hiding at No. 10 Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, in the French Concession. Her father, Lu Yizhang, and her maternal uncle, Wang Shushan, were also living in the lane, etc. After obtaining the confession, they immediately joined the Songshan Road Police Station and went to the three-story building and arrested the female culprit, Lu Wangshi, and the suspects Lu Yizhang and Wang Shushan. After being brought to the district and interrogated, Lu Wangshi confessed that she was 31 years old and from Huzhou, Zhejiang. She directly admitted that at about 7 p.m. that afternoon, she and Qiang Fugeng went to the Youth Association Lane behind Zhaofeng Garden to ask Zhou Wenbo for 50 yuan to repay Zhang Hanzhang's interest because she guaranteed Qiang Fugeng's debt of 500 yuan to Zhang Hanzhang. Unexpectedly, Zhou Wenbo had moved earlier. So, they returned. When walking on the small stone bridge of the Youth Association Lane, they saw three or five people coming towards them. Suddenly, Zhang Hanzhang knocked Qiang Fugeng down into the Binnei River. Zhang Hanzhang told me to take a rickshaw and leave first. Then, Zhang Hanzhang caught up and also took a rickshaw to Wujiaochang, where they hired a car and rode together to Dongxin Bridge, where they got off and dispersed separately. I don't know the details of what happened afterward. The district deemed the case to be an assassination and ordered that the four suspects, including Lu Wangshi, be sent to the headquarters for legal action yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Chinese Zheng Ruyi Invents Scientific Building Materials, Striving to Counter Foreign Goods and Prevent Outflow of Capital <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Nine out of ten of our country's building materials rely on foreign countries, and domestic products are scarce. Chemist Zheng Ruyi, recognizing this, founded the Yali Manufacturing Factory three years ago to specialize in the manufacture of various domestic building materials, hoping to recover our rights and interests. The number of products has now increased to twelve. The first two products to be launched, Waterproofing Paste and Transparent Waterproofing Paint, have caused similar imported goods to disappear from the market and have greatly impacted oil felt. The factory has three new products, which are introduced as follows:</p>
<p>Colloidal Oil: Most cement roofs use oil felt, which is not only expensive and labor-intensive but also black and uneven, and the material is heavy. Colloidal oil is a thin chemical oil. When used, it only needs to be applied to a cement surface, and it can penetrate into the micropores and seal them. As for the shape of the roof, it does not change. The price is extremely low, only four or five yuan per square meter.</p>
<p>Waterproofing Paint: It is very difficult to repair leaking cement roofs because cement mortar is ineffective. With the advent of Waterproofing Paste, this problem can be easily solved. It can repair any leaking cement, white iron, or oil felt roof, platform, etc., with a single brush, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Wood Preservative Oil: Wood Preservative Oil can make wood resistant to insects and durable. It can be used alone or mixed with tung oil. It is a preservative for wood piles, boats, and building timber. Its selling price is one-third lower than similar imported products on the market. It is also reported that in order to promote business, the factory has sent business director Jin to Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and the South Seas Islands to negotiate distribution.</p>

<p>Rickshaw puller Wang Yuzhen from Tongzhou and his companion Zhao Yutai from Jiangbei had a dispute over passengers at Wuchang Road at about 10 a.m. on the 13th of last month. They fought each other, and as a result, Zhao suffered a severe head injury and fell to the ground crying for help. The patrol police arrested Wang and took him to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment. His injuries were quite severe. The next morning, the police sent the suspect Wang to the First Special District Court for adjudication pending the recovery of the victim. The other day, Judge Wu Zehan visited the Third Criminal Court for a further hearing. Lawyer Li Zhi of the Public Works Department said that the plaintiff's injury has slightly recovered and there is no danger to his life. He came to court to testify. According to Zhao Yutai's statement, his family is poor. Since being injured by the defendant, he has been unable to pull a rickshaw, and life has been difficult. He demanded compensation of eighty yuan for his losses and did not pursue the criminal part. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he had no money to pay and could at most raise twenty yuan for negotiation. The judge, Zhao, insisted on the above amount. Judge Wu ordered that he be remanded in custody, and the sentence will be announced on schedule.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Seaman Tang Xiangjun's Body Found Floating <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Tang Xiangjun, 27 years old, from Ningbo, was a sailor on the Jianghai Customs Haiguang ferry. At 2:45 p.m. on the 6th of this month, Tang was working on the side of the Haiguang ferry in Zhao Xingde's sampan No. 71, clearing the water pipes when a ship entered the port and passed by the Haiguang ferry. Suddenly, waves splashed, shaking the sampan, and Tang Xiangjun was knocked into the river. He drowned immediately and did not resurface. Although efforts were made to salvage him, there was no trace of his body. Until 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, Tang Xiangjun's body floated up in the river at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. The rescue bureau patrol boat took him to the South Wharf to await inspection. Yesterday morning, the Water Patrol Police Station prepared a letter and sent Detective Xu Lenian, along with witnesses Shen Dingdong, the fourth steward of the Haiguang ferry, and Zhao Xingde, the owner of the sampan, to the Local Court to request an autopsy. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu examined the case and ordered that they go to the mortuary to wait. Soon after, Prosecutor Tang, along with the coroner, went to the South Wharf and confirmed that the deceased Tang Xiangjun had indeed drowned in the river. He filled out the death certificate and ordered the family to collect the coffin and wait for instructions. It is learned that the deceased Tang Xiangjun, also known as Agen, lost his father at a young age. He was originally from Ningbo. His family includes an elderly mother in her sixties, a wife, and a four-year-old daughter, as well as a son born last June. The family of several people all relied on the deceased for a living.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Huang Laigui's Appeal Dismissed <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Huang Laigui, 21 years old from Anhui, was previously a clerk at Yanqing Tang, a pickled melon shop on Xian Guagua Street in the South City. Previously, he stole and sold goods and then absconded with the money. After searching for him without success, the shop owner, Xu Hanming, published a notice urging him to come forward and settle the matter out of their fellow-villager relationship. However, after seeing the notice, Huang hired lawyer Fang Junjie and sued Xu Hanming in the Local Court for defamation and hired lawyers Zhu Xiyun and Zhu Zhizhong to defend him. After the court hearing, Xu Hanmin was acquitted. Huang, however, did not accept the verdict and appealed again. After two court hearings, the appeal was dismissed. This was because the court had already verified that the facts stated in the notice regarding Huang Laigui were accurate. Furthermore, the prosecutor had concluded the investigation of his illegal acts and had filed a public prosecution on May 16th of this year. During the appeal court hearing, Huang's testimony was completely inconsistent with that of his witness, Bao Caizhang, which was obviously fabricated. Therefore, the court held that the appellant's empty accusations could not be said to have reason and ruled to reject the appeal.</p>

In the past few days, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Huishan Police Station arrested the robbers, Ying Xingdao and Shen Agen, both Ningbo natives, along with women Shen Pan and Zhang Wang, at Zhaofeng Road and Rongfa Inn, Baoyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession. The following morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, made a statement requesting an extension of their detention for further investigation. Wang Tangde, the victim, testified that he was out at the time and only found out upon returning home. According to his daughter, Meirong, three robbers entered through the back door, threatened them into silence, and stole six gold rings. When questioned, the defendants' statements were evasive. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be remanded in custody separately, with a revised date for further investigation.</p>

Pure Buliduo is an excellent medicine for physical weakness and poor metabolism. Buliduo with quinine is an excellent medicine for colds, coughs, and tuberculosis. Buliduo with iodine is an excellent medicine for asthma, shortness of breath, syphilis, and scrofula. Buliduo with arsenic is an excellent medicine for blood deficiency, weak nerves, and chronic skin diseases.

<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news of Ms. Xia Xiaoqing receiving a Swiss flying license in our Geneva dispatch on the 3rd of this month, after investigation, Ms. Li is the wife of Mr. Zheng Baifeng, Secretary of the League of Nations. Due to an omission in the telegram, the two characters (Baifeng) were mistranslated. We hereby urgently correct this error and request that you publish this correction in your newspaper. Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, July 9.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>We, Ni Qiusheng, et al., claim that because the Xin Pudong Bao and the Pudong Xing Bao published news about (Tongxing Clothing Store operating a gambling den) and (Zhoupu Gambling Case), we, being law-abiding merchants, have never engaged in such illegal activities. Therefore, we filed a private prosecution and the First Special District Court held a hearing on July 7th, before advising a postponement for a further hearing. However, upon reading the news item (Two Pudong Newspapers Sued) published in the Shen Bao on July 9th, which contains entirely one-sided statements, we fear that misinformation will lead to further misinformation and confuse the public. We therefore request that you write a letter to the Shen Bao to clarify that these statements should be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column to correct the record, etc. Therefore, we are writing on their behalf, requesting that you investigate and handle this matter. Respectfully, to the Editor of the Shen Bao, Lawyer Wang Tiehua.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Having read a news item titled "Villagers Seeking Rain Cause Trouble" in your newspaper on July 7th, after checking with the report of Gu Xianchun, the independent platoon leader of our district regiment, we have found some discrepancies. We are writing to correct these discrepancies. It was found that members of the platoon, in an effort to maintain order, were stabbed by thugs. Platoon member Pan Yiqin (mistakenly published as Pan Huicheng) was robbed of a 6-inch handgun (No. 964) while in pain. The gun's magazine has been retrieved by villager Xu Abu and handed over to the Public Security Bureau of the Sixth District for investigation. In addition, platoon members Gu Zhaopeng (mistakenly identified as Gu Zhaotang), Xu Zhongying, and Zou Liukang all suffered injuries to their backs and faces. Two suspects have already been apprehended, and we have petitioned the superiors to investigate the matter. We hereby correct the record and request that this correction be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column to ensure accuracy. Respectfully, Shanghai Pusong District Defense Regiment, July 7.</p>

<p>(1) Introduction to 20 Good Summer Reads</p>
<p>(2) Important Mailbox - 3 Items</p>
<p>(1) 20 Good Summer Reads. Many readers have written requesting special reading guidance for the summer. This is because it is too hot in the summer, and it is difficult to read difficult books. Some readers are students with summer vacations, and even friends working in offices may not work in the afternoons. There is a lot of free time, so you can leisurely read some books. Other friends who are busy 12 hours a day cannot talk about summer rest, but the climate will definitely affect their lives. In the summer, everyone wants to find something refreshing to adjust their lives. Therefore, the last issue of this journal asked readers for their opinions on summer reading materials. This week, we have received many enthusiastic submissions from readers, and we have received a lot of materials. Now, referring to everyone's opinions, we have selected 20 books, divided into 10 literary works and 10 books of a social science nature, for summer study.</p>

<p>(2) Mailbox</p>
<p>I. Please Enclose Postage for Mail Order (Reader Communication Cards). Recently, readers from both local and other cities have been sending mail orders for Reader Communication Cards to this department, but they have not enclosed postage, which has invisibly increased a small loss for this department. Because the pricing of the communication cards is entirely based on cost, and more than 200 books have been sold in other cities, the loss has reached more than 10 yuan, which has greatly affected the budget of this department. Now, we request that all readers, when ordering by mail from other cities in the future, please enclose 5 fen for postage, and for local cities, please enclose 2 fen. Those who have already received the communication cards from this department but have not yet enclosed postage are also requested to send it. Stamps are fully accepted. II. Solicitation of Criticism of Reading Materials. This library has thousands of books. There are often hundreds of books of the same nature. Among them, there are naturally many famous books worth reading carefully, but there are also inevitably some unhealthy foods that are still circulating outside, which makes us very uneasy. This department originally had a plan to accurately inspect the library's collection and practically take on the task of (book lending guidance). However, for several months, due to the shortage of manpower, although we have worked very hard, we have not been able to achieve even one-ten-thousandth of what we hoped for. Now we have decided to open this work to all readers and ask everyone to participate. For any books published in China, whether this library has them or not, after you have read them, whether the content is good or bad, or if you find any printing errors, please write them out clearly and send them to us for our reference. We also request that people across the country who are enthusiastic about education give us some guidance in this regard at any time. We believe that this is a very meaningful work, and given that publication criticism is not sound today, we should do it with collective power. We are waiting for everyone's enthusiastic response to this request. III. Mail Lending Extended to Other Cities. All readers from other cities who have joined the Reading Guidance Department are entitled to mail lending. However, they must have a regular reading correspondence relationship with this department for one month before they can obtain this right. This has been repeatedly published in earlier issues of this journal. Recently, there are still many readers who have joined this department but have not made a request to borrow books from this department who do not understand that we provide this convenience for readers in other cities. Now, to avoid the trouble of explaining it one by one, we are publicly announcing it again here. If you have joined the research of this department and need us to provide books, you can make a request to this department. We will introduce you to the library's mail lending department according to certain procedures, so that everyone has books to read.</p>

<p>— Original Work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At the same time, Guangxu was extremely optimistic because he knew very clearly that in such an environment, it was as impossible as finding a needle in a haystack to hope to rule. At least as long as the Empress Dowager was alive, he did not have to think about being a comfortable, real emperor again. So he was not sad. He attributed his situation to fate, and in this way, he felt much happier mentally. For example, this time when he went to Fengtian, although he knew that the Empress Dowager wanted to monitor him, he simply thought that he wanted to go out for a tour. Along the way, he freely enjoyed the scenery through the train window. Whenever the train stopped, except for a few of us who had to stay to serve the Empress Dowager, the rest could get off the train and stroll around at will. At this time, Guangxu would often jump down and walk with us. He was very short, with a bit of childishness on his face, but he was not arrogant, and he spoke fluently and pleasantly. He treated us female officials like friends. He probably knew my childhood experiences very well, so he often wanted to talk to me. He asked me about the railways in various European and American countries, as well as the personalities and anecdotes of the monarchs or heads of state of various countries at that time. I only told him the little I knew, and he was very happy and satisfied.</p>
<p>(If I were a real monarch in reality,) he said to me excitedly once, (able to rule the country like the Old Buddha, then the first thing I would do is to follow the methods of the monarchs or heads of state of those foreign countries you told me about and travel around the world. Of course, I also like to travel incognito and don't want people to know my true identity because such a tour is enjoyable. How constrained are we at this moment?) (79)</p>
<h3 id="e197">Queen Bee <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Shichi</p>
<p>There has been a beehive on the floor for nearly a year! When I wake up from my afternoon nap, I often hear the bees buzzing, the sound is humorous and gentle, buzzing, making people feel spiritually intoxicated!</p>
<p>In the spring, a bee came, its body was longer than the average, and its color was yellow. This is probably the queen bee! I don't know if the throne was chosen by the bees or taken by force. I won't pay attention to it for the time being, but looking at its shape, it stays motionless in the center of a wax row. Every bee flies around it, as if protecting it, holding small petals in its mouth, and everyone works hard. Their actions are logical, and their lives are strangely fortunate.</p>
<p>One day, a black mountain bee came. It was another species, its body was as big as a cicada, and its shape was terribly ugly. First, it circled outside the hive. It probably saw the comfortable materials and abundant food inside, its eyes gradually turned red, and finally it shrugged its wings and broke straight into the inner layer of the beehive.</p>
<p>Immediately, the orderly crowd stirred up a riot. The queen bee let out a strange cry, miserable and tense, probably giving orders. At the same time, every bee abandoned its small petals and fought fiercely with the mountain bee. The guy, first relying on his strength, also struggled to resist, but he could not withstand the unified and disciplined attack. Before long, he was embarrassed and finally stung and bitten to death alive by the bees. Good! The resistance was successful, order gradually returned, every bee picked up the small petals again, buzzing, always doing that lucky life. At the same time, the queen bee also returned to her central position.</p>
<p>Seeing this battle, I immediately understood that the power of unity is really great, and I also know why the queen bee is supported by her kind. It turns out that she has her own instinct. The throne is not obtained by fluke. At least, she can resist insults and defend the territory!</p>
<h3 id="e198">Mr. Zhu <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu is a rural schoolteacher who sits on the sidelines; because he is deeply trusted by the general villagers, his disciples are indeed quite numerous. However, his own knowledge is very limited; therefore, when teaching and holding a pen, he inevitably has occasional typos and mispronunciations, as well as allusions that are (a donkey's lips don't match a horse's mouth).</p>
<p>The reason why villagers send their children to private schools is nothing more than to want them to recognize a few more names; therefore, the textbooks they use are still those (Three Character Classic), (Thousand Character Classic), (Hundred Family Surnames), (……) and the like. When Mr. Zhu was teaching the compound surname (Mùqí Sima) in the (Hundred Family Surnames), he actually pronounced the two characters (Mùqí) as (Wànshì). Someone said to him: (This should be read as (Mùqí). It is wrong to read it as (Wànshì).) He sternly said: (How can this be?) Don't you see that one ten thousand and two ten thousand in mahjong... isn't that the small (Wàn) character? As for (Qí), it means waiting, everyone knows that. Where is the mistake?) This person saw that he was unreasonable, so he remained silent.</p>
<p>One day, someone asked him to write a contract for learning carpentry, and he actually (didn't decline) and took on the task without hesitation; after he finished writing, everyone who saw it burst into laughter. It turned out that at the end of the contract, he added an incredible classic allusion, (If he can dream up a flowery pen in the future, it will be thanks to the master's gift)! Someone jokingly said: (The ax used by carpenters is not a pen, so it should be said that he dreams up a flowery ax to be appropriate.) At this point, he realized his own misappropriation and immediately blushed; but he still stubbornly argued: (There is still a bamboo pen in the ink fountain used by carpenters; then, it can't be considered completely wrong!)</p>
<p>It is said that he is still sitting and hugging (Gaobi) and living the life of a (Monkey King).</p>

<p>Chapter 31</p>
<p>Three Times Facing the White-Clad Foes in the Snow Array</p>
<p>The Entire Battalion Sacrificed, Red Eyes Piercing the Gun Forest</p>
<p>Ziqiang shouted from the trench, having fired over a dozen cannons. He muttered to himself, "While there's still breath, I must fight! What's the point of lying in the trench?" He slapped his hands on the edge of the earthen wall and leaped to his feet. The sound of the cannons was indeed more invigorating than any medicine. After this slap, his spirit was completely restored. He jumped down from the bed and ran outside. As he ran out of the house, a cannonball landed right on the roof, collapsing the entire structure. Before the cannonball struck, Ziqiang had already dived to the ground at the first whooshing sound. When the cannonball landed, he was covered in dust. Turning back to look at the house, it was now a pile of rubble. The few soldiers recuperating inside were, needless to say, sacrificed. Ziqiang immediately felt that this body of his was completely salvaged. To stake this salvaged life against the enemy was the most worthwhile thing to do. Thus, he found a fellow soldier, asked where the battalion commander was at the fort, and ran to Baofang, standing tall and giving a military salute. Baofang asked, "Are you completely well?" Ziqiang replied, "I'm well, I can do anything." Baofang said, "Good! You go back to lead your own company. Don't open fire until the enemy is within two thousand meters. Stay calm." Ziqiang agreed and retreated, finding his own brothers. They were like children who had lost their mother's milk, finding their mother again. Although military discipline was in place, everyone expressed their welcome in the smallest of voices, with a booming sound. But they all listened to the acting company commander's orders, each guarding a section of the fort, crouching down and quietly waiting for the enemy. Ziqiang said, "I'm here." Less than five minutes after these words, the black dots of the enemy's shadows were faintly visible in the snowy ground outside the fort. This was unbearable. Machine guns and rifles from the fort began to fire. Since the defending troops were already engaged in defensive warfare, there was no time for concealment. They boldly took a tough stance and returned fire toward the fort. (430)</p>

<p>— Gu Pu</p>
<p>Lingxian was a poor family's daughter. At the age of seven, her opium-addicted father sold her to the farming Li family for forty yuan to be their adopted daughter-in-law, meant to be the future wife of Li's second son, Erbao. At that time, Erbao was only three years old, constantly needing to be held and comforted. Lingxian became the nanny for her future little husband. In Lingxian's young mind, there was no concept of "man and woman" or "husband and wife," so she always treated Erbao like her own blood brother.</p>
<p>The wheels of time moved forward incessantly. Lingxian was now eighteen years old. She deeply felt that different changes had occurred to various parts of her body. She heard people talking about matters between men and women, always listening quietly and silently. Sometimes, neighbors would joke with her about her little husband, and she would coyly spit and walk away in shame.</p>
<p>Now, when Lingxian saw her fourteen-year-old little husband, she always felt distant and couldn't avoid him, no longer as intimate as during her nanny days.</p>
<p>Lingxian's in-laws were very happy to see Lingxian growing up like an adult. They planned to marry them off when their son turned sixteen, so they could have a fair and chubby grandson three years later.</p>
<p>But every time Lingxian saw her little husband, she always felt an indescribable sorrow in her heart.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Recording Zhang Zhiyu, the Bamboo Carving and Seal Engraving Master <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yangyang</p>
<p>Among the various arts of our country, the origins are earliest, and the successes are numerous. Truly, they are not like the various arts of Europe and America, stealing our leftovers and imitating our old wisdom, and thus are unable to look up to us in the slightest. What is regrettable is that, in our country, most value something only when it is a secret, impossible to transmit. Individuals all like to keep it as their private property, and the habit has been passed down, impossible to correct. If one's son is virtuous, one is lucky enough to preserve and inherit one or two of these skills. If the descendants are unworthy, or their talents and abilities are insufficient, then the person dies, and their art also vanishes. In Europe and America, however, they always do the opposite. Whenever there is a long skill or an invention of any art, they mainly make it public, to seek like-minded people, invent and improve together, and conduct research diligently, making sure the art is glorious, prosperous, and endlessly progressing. In fact, if you examine the source, most of it is plagiarized from ancient Eastern culture, but they are willing to put in hard work and conduct in-depth research. There is Zhang Zhiyu, a famous carving artist from Hebei, who lives in the old capital. He is skilled in calligraphy, capable of writing, and particularly proficient in seal engraving and bamboo carving. He has never been selfish with his art in his life, but always aimed to pass it on, so over the years, countless people have come from his school. The art of bamboo carving began in the Song dynasty, flourished in the Ming dynasty, and the Jiaxing region was the most famous in the Qing dynasty. North of the Yangtze River, it seems there has been no mention of it. Zhang, at the age of twenty, was already immersed and immersed himself in seal engraving and bamboo carving, spending his days silently exploring ancient thoughts, aiming to open up new paths in this art. Since there was no formal mentorship, but imagining things out of nothing, he was able to comprehend the ultimate principles and become a master. Initially, Zhang would visit markets to observe the carving methods on bamboo fan handles sold in the market, which were extremely inelegant. So he would buy them and use his seal engraving knife to repair them, and he was able to master it easily, doing as he wished. Later, he began to carve himself. In three years, he never stopped for a moment. His perseverance and determination were such. His most exquisite carvings were the brick-and-tile rubbings he traced onto bamboo objects. Later, calligraphy and painting became popular on fan bones, and contemporary scholars competed to imitate them. Zhang also began to excel at this, such as the so-called "keeping the green method" and "Xiangfei flower patching," all of which were invented and created by him. "Flower patching" was particularly difficult. Xiangfei bamboo bones are very tender, and when making utensils and fans, the skin is often scratched, which interferes with the original plan for carving calligraphy and painting. However, high-quality bamboo products are a pity to discard, so he had to adapt to the materials and carve flower patterns on the damaged areas. Plum branches are the most suitable carvings for flower patching, so whenever there were damaged items, after Zhang patched and carved plum blossoms, there was not only no drawback of forcing the bamboo to fit, but also a magical touch, truly seamless.</p>
<p>He often said to people in his life: "The way of art is difficult to be elegant but easy to be vulgar. The deeper the skill, the easier it is to become vulgar. It is like rowing a boat upstream, which requires the strength of several people and may not be as expected. Rowing downstream, one person paddling is easy to achieve. This is the difference between vulgarity and elegance." He also commented on bamboo carving: "Elegance is like rowing upstream, which requires more effort, using wisdom and change, and also more knife techniques. It is difficult to describe the elegance of the finished product, only the heart can understand it. For example, if there is an elegant person in front of you, they are no different from ordinary people, and you don't really know where the elegance lies. Only when they face a major crisis without surrendering or a great disaster without being corrupt, then you know their elegance, which can be expressed without reservation. Bamboo carving is also like this, it should have an indelible spirit. Reading it a hundred times without getting tired, there is something to ponder everywhere, this is truly elegant. If you see everything at a glance and then feel disgusted after seeing it again, it is extremely inelegant, and inelegance is vulgarity. A soft brush is difficult to be hard, but hardness is elegant; it is easy to carve deep with a knife, but shallowness is elegant; it is easy to carve shallow with a single knife, but depth is elegant. Like poetry, unusual sentences are better, and something is only valuable after it is difficult to achieve."</p>
<p>Zhang's seal engraving mostly imitates the methods of the ancients, and he made many kinds of copper seal knobs. In the past thirty years, he has carved three or four thousand bamboo pieces and engraved more than ten thousand seals, a truly amazing achievement. The published seal manuals and engravings are titled "Seal Traces," and the carvings mostly imitate the vertical axes and compositions of famous people of ancient and modern times, and they can be so lifelike that viewers do not know that they are engravings. The most exquisite seals are the miniature seals, both spiritual and unique. A work of divine skill, one can only sigh in admiration.</p>
<p>Zhang also created seven kinds of seal paste that do not freeze in winter or leak in summer. The white characters do not reveal the background, and the red characters are not blurred. If you bake it with fire, it turns black as ink but can return to its original color, a truly good product. A certain celebrity in the old capital once wanted to invest money to let him open a store to respond to the needs of the world, but it is not known whether it was actually implemented. However, since Zhang did not keep his achievements secret, his method should have been widely spread in the Tianjin area for a long time.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Saiyun, the owner of the Zhe Huan residence, once wrote a couplet to give to him, saying: "Should be combined with the bamboo carvers and seal carvers, directly chasing Zhang Dian and Mi Dian's calligraphy." Dan Weng also gave a poem, saying: "The seal carver is already Yan Chang, the bamboo carver also hopes to be Huang, the calligrapher is the Ershui, the three Zhangs are the same as Zhang." These are all people who deeply admired Zhiyu.</p>

<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) The Eleventh World Games, scheduled to open in Berlin, Germany on August 1, 1936, China has prepared to participate. The chairman of the organizing committee, Lewald, sent a long letter to Ping today (6th), detailing the mission of the Games and the actual preparations. The main points are excerpted and translated as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Profound Meaning of the World Games <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The World Games held in 1932, it is believed, are still remembered by people all over the world. This Games has been held ten times, the first time in Athens. This is the highest ideal, to enable the sports of all countries to follow uniform rules, hoping to have a period of progress every four years. Therefore, it is the most glorious thing in history to enable all nations to have sports relations with each other. Thanks to the support of friends from all walks of life, the World Olympic Games has been consolidated. In addition, there are various literary, musical, and sculptural competitions, and there has been a large-scale construction of sports equipment and cultural medals. There are two great events among them: on the one hand, to improve the competitive spirit of all countries, and on the other hand, to enable the people of all countries to have the idea of strengthening their physique, to have patriotism, knightly bravery, and noble spirit. If so, the benefits to the modern group are not small. All civilized countries in the world should do their best, and governments should also be open and honest, serving the entire world, and should have an attitude of joy, and should no longer have other conflicting international opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Glorious Achievements Over the Years <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The 1936 World Games - that is, the Eleventh Olympic Games - was decided by the Barcelona International Olympic Committee in 1931 to be held in Berlin, the capital of Germany. Previously, Germany was supposed to hold it in 1916. At that time, it was first held in Stockholm, in order to integrate all Western culture. At that time, everyone had a kind of hope for this 1916 Games, cheering and carrying on, regarding this time (opening in Germany) as serving the emperor of the time. The war broke out at this time, causing it to sink invisibly. The Olympic Games held in Antwerp, Belgium in 1920, and the Olympic Games to be held in Paris in 1924, were also suspended due to the shock of the war. Fortunately, the representatives tried their best to maintain it, and it still exists to this day, without losing its greatness. It was not until 1928 that it was held in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. This international games brought together countries that were previously enemies, reconciled as before. The spirit of this games is the best thing in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e206">German Government Advocating <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>This time, this event, held in Berlin, can show a deeper and broader meaning. All the people of Germany are looking forward to the arrival of this day, admiring the athletes and spectators from all over the world, who have come from afar to visit. This is the biggest opportunity after the World War. The German nation can take this opportunity to step into the world arena, try out its great creativity, refresh the world's ears and eyes, and know that our ancient civilized Germany has a good cultivation in sports and new ideas of the modern era. President Hindenburg, the honorable general, has allowed to give more protection, and the new government under the leadership of Hitler has also approved and helped as much as possible. Here, the Olympic principles guide all countries with the criteria of striving and creating, so that many unnecessary political struggles in the country can be brought into the right track. There is no racial boundary or religious sect here. Anyone who wishes to participate will be treated equally. The organizers of this conference have made considerable preparations, without any obstacles, and can carry out the whole process in Berlin. The Organizing Committee has established a Supreme Committee, and the Honorary Chairman is the Mayor of Berlin. The German Gymnastics Federation and the Sports League are responsible for preparing the sports equipment. The chairman of the Organizing Committee wrote an article entitled "I want to awaken the youth of the world". This article symbolizes the 1936 Games as a wake-up call. This bell will be issued for the first time when the conference opens on August 1, 1936.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Preferential Treatment for Athletes <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>It does not take long to take a train to Berlin in densely populated Germany. Berlin can accommodate 8 million to 10 million people, so people from other important cities can come here to observe as much as possible. Because Berlin is located in the center of Europe, it has a special good traffic foundation and is the intersection point of the continental traffic routes. Therefore, this worldwide Games will be held here, opening a new era. The Organizing Committee has agreed on preferential treatment measures with German merchant ships and railway agencies, that is, all foreign groups who want to come to Berlin can enjoy low-cost treatment. Berlin has superior hotels, such beautiful hotels, with complete hospitality and everything available, and the price is also quite low. If athletes from a certain country want to rest after the competition, the Organizing Committee has prepared an Olympic Village for them, which is only fourteen kilometers straight from Berlin Central Station. There are dormitories built layer by layer, where they can live freely.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Stadium Architecture <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Berlin has planned and completed everything else about the Olympic Games. The racecourse and track opened at the bottom of the city in 1916 still exist today. There are lush trees there, created using modern common sense, and can accommodate 100,000 spectators around the perimeter. Other buildings are very grand, but the swimming pool is located elsewhere. Most of the important competition fields are at the Oval. The longitudinal axis of the entire field is 50 meters, and everything in it is explained with diagrams. This Games is of great benefit to Germany. German university students can train their physique on the German sports field and directly connect with all parties. However, in sports buildings or main competition fields, they must not be arbitrary, such as when announcing their withdrawal from the Games, during football games, and during fencing, and when important competitions are held, all prizes are not displayed in the sports field, but placed in a display room outside the field, a ten-minute or twenty-minute car ride from the sports field. As for the artistic competition works of each participant, they are displayed in the hall inside the sports field. This can gather all kinds of Olympic sports products, which is an unprecedented event. Therefore, all athletes, in this crowded conference, do not spend time and energy, and can move their works from their original place to other places. As for the rowing course, it is located at the Grunau Lake, opposite the end of Berlin, which can be reached in three-quarters of an hour. However, it is more ingenious than the Amsterdam waterway in the Netherlands, and can accommodate four or more small boats competing side by side. There are also many German residents here. If a sailing competition is used, there are many boats around the lake in Berlin, which can be used for spectators to appreciate on the lake. There have also been large-scale boat races before, which we can still be interested in. Before the war, Germany held a royal boat race on this lake. The procedure of the Olympic Games is not transmitted orally in the center of the venue, but it is not called out separately, but must enter the venue in order. This straight sailing of the sailboat allows the audience to observe clearly. If we want all the audiences to have a special good impression in Germany this time, we hope that all German sports organizations will actively participate, and it would be better if more than a thousand people participate, in order to introduce the genius of our nation's creation. After the sports competition, a special selection of the strengths of various national groups is attached, performing a parade horse race, or holding a grand concert. This concert is a common thing in Berlin.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Followed by the Opening of the Art Conference <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>We have already decided to continue the art conference competition immediately. The highest point of the world's art creation is attached, and a large-scale carnival performance of theater musicians is held to show the true spirit of the Olympic Games. In this way, the ideals of modern humans can be realized through this conference, and we can also know how our modern German nation is. Moreover, the outstanding ancient Greek history will also float in our minds. Berliners cherish the only pearl, and German scholars can melt the ancient culture of Olympic Greece. We hope that this Olympic art exhibition will be a spectacular sight. Secondly, we hope that foreign visitors, when visiting Berlin, must know that the capital of Germany is the center of German art and spiritual life. Friends who have an interest in music and art, or who have an interest in natural science and industry, can also visit and practice here as much as possible. In terms of historical aspects worthy of commemoration, there are various beautiful buildings. There are palaces in the city and the palace of the people of Charlottenburg. There is a Prussian patron saint in front of the city gate. The museum has magnificent palaces and vast parks. After the Games, trains and private carriages in Berlin will be particularly cheap, and there are also airplanes available for tourists to tour the more beautiful lakes, the scenery in the lakes, and the connected mountains, the Rhine Valley, and to appreciate the birthplace of ancient South German culture.</p>

<h3 id="e218">The Ministry of Education Again Rectifies the National and Private Universities in Beiping, Cancels the Graduate School of Normal University and Ends the North China College, Peking University and Yanjing University are Commended by the Ministry of Education for Their Efforts in Running Schools <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) The Ministry of Education's order to rectify the universities in Beiping has arrived in Ping one after another. It expressed satisfaction with Yanjing University and Peking University, and the other colleges and universities have their own criticisms. The rectification of each university is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e219">Normal University <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The National Normal University has recently received instructions from the Ministry of Education, with the following four points: (1) The equipment is not sufficiently adequate, the number of staff and security personnel is excessive and should be reduced, and administrative expenses should be streamlined to enhance equipment. (2) There are few full-time teachers, and many important teachers hold concurrent positions and receive concurrent salaries. Concurrent positions should be restricted, and internal part-time teaching should not be compensated. (3) There are too few graduate students and too many staff in the graduate school, with no special equipment, so no achievements can be expected. It should be discontinued starting from the next academic year. (4) To train good teachers for secondary schools, special attention should be paid to moral education. This reporter interviewed the school authorities to ask how they would implement these instructions. It was said that items one, two, and four would be earnestly improved. Regarding item three, the commissioner's report contained inaccuracies. (Note: The graduate school is divided into three departments: the teaching material compilation department, the educational problem research department, and the graduate student training department. The inspector's report stated that there were twelve graduate students and forty-six staff members. It is planned to convene a graduate school committee to discuss the order in detail and request the Ministry of Education to withdraw the decision.)</p>
<h3 id="e220">Peiping University <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>National Peiping University was the first to receive the Ministry of Education's instruction. The main points of the instructions have been detailed in this newspaper's special dispatch from Peiping on the 5th. The merger of the Law and Commerce Colleges will be carried out according to the order. Zuo Zonglun, the dean of the College of Commerce, returned to Peiping yesterday and convened a meeting of department heads and professors at 3 PM today (the 7th) to report on his trip to the south. After the meeting, this reporter interviewed Zuo, who said that he received the Ministry of Education's order about merging the college with the Law College two weeks ago. He went to Beijing the next morning to strongly argue with the Ministry of Education. Minister Wang said there was no way to reverse the decision. He argued further, but it was not approved. He felt it was futile to remain in Beijing and received telegrams from the college's faculty and students urging him to return. He returned to Peiping on the evening of the 6th. The College of Commerce alumni association will hold a meeting today and resolve to (1) send a telegram to the whole country to oppose the merger with the College of Law; (2) issue a declaration detailing the history of the College of Commerce and the reasons for opposing the merger with the College of Law, and seek assistance; (4) contact former presidents and deans of the college, as well as board members before the merger with Peiping University, to jointly protect the college.</p>
<p>Xu Shoushang, the new president of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, left Beijing on the 6th and is expected to arrive in Peiping tomorrow morning (the 8th) at 8 AM. After arriving, he will hold a college affairs meeting to discuss abolishing the departmental teaching groups.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Peking University <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>A copy of the Ministry of Education inspector's report on Peking University has been sent to Peiping, indicating four points: (1) The number of faculty and staff is excessive. (2) The inspection of student performance and attendance is quite effective, and the responsible spirit of the school's administrative staff is particularly commendable. (3) The College of Science has achieved excellent results. (4) The academic atmosphere is good. Zhu Hong, the secretary of Peking University, stated that the school will comply with the Ministry's order. The method for employing staff will be changed in the next academic year. President Jiang (Menglin) has decided not to renew contracts for staff who are idle in their daily work in order to save money. More than ten staff members have been laid off.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Chaoyang College <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Based on the inspector's report, the Ministry of Education issued instructions to Peiping Private Chaoyang College, pointing out five points: (1) The low number of absences of teachers and students, and the seriousness of teachers' teaching and students' listening, are quite commendable. (2) The specialized departments should be terminated starting from this year. (3) More full-time military instructors should be hired. (4) The number of students in each class should not exceed the Ministry's quota of fifty. (5) Overly large classrooms are not suitable and should be improved. Wang Jin, the dean of studies at the college, said that the college's specialized departments, up to the 22nd year of the Republic, only included the departments of law, political economics. However, the college has already complied with the Ministry of Education's previous order to close all specialized departments of universities nationwide by the end of the 22nd year of the Republic. There is no need to discuss it again. Although there are many students in each class, they have not exceeded the Ministry's quota, so there is no need to discuss it again. As for hiring specialized teachers and improving classrooms, the college will follow the Ministry's order.</p>
<h3 id="e223">China College <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has instructed Peiping Private China College to make the following reforms: (1) Hire more full-time professors. (2) Change the Department of Physics and Chemistry to the Department of Chemistry. (3) Merge the Department of Commerce and the Department of Economics. (4) Pay attention to the attendance and absence of teachers and students. (5) Improve the equipment of the College of Science. After receiving the order, the college reported to the Ministry of Education that the Department of Physics and Chemistry would be changed to the Department of Chemistry starting this year. As for hiring full-time professors, paying attention to the attendance and absence of teachers and students, and improving the equipment of the College of Science, it can also be done this year. However, merging the Department of Commerce and the Department of Economics is difficult in practice, so it is requested that the Department of Commerce be allowed to continue to exist. It is reported that this document has already been sent out.</p>
<h3 id="e224">North China College <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>North China College has been run well, but it is difficult to develop due to financial difficulties. After the Ministry of Education inspector completed the inspection, the educational aspects of the college were deemed commendable, but the funding was considered too low. Now the Ministry of Education has ordered North China College to close. Zheng Haoran, the dean of studies at the college, went to Beijing to contact President Chu Minyi and the Ministry of Education. It is reported that the college can continue to operate in the next academic year.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Yenching University <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Yenching University recently received instructions from the Ministry of Education, the original text of which is as follows: The school was inspected by personnel dispatched by this Ministry, and according to the report submitted, after careful review, most of the school's teachers are full-time and can work hard on research. The staff are also conscientious in their work, the financial arrangements are appropriate, and the equipment is adequate. The school provides residences for faculty and staff, providing teachers and students with opportunities to interact. These achievements are commendable. However, the following points still need attention and improvement: (1) The school originally had three colleges, eighteen departments, two specialized courses, and a graduate school divided into twelve academic fields, which is too large. The school is currently experiencing financial difficulties and should strive to consolidate in the following two ways to remedy this situation: (1) The colleges and departments should consider merging and submit a request to the Ministry for approval. (2) The graduate school should reduce its scope and submit a proposal for approval in accordance with the "Provisional Organization Regulations for University Graduate Schools" promulgated by the Ministry. (2) The school's administration and printed regulations are mostly in English, which is inappropriate. In the future, Chinese should be used. (3) The school's student life is often extravagant and should be corrected to cultivate a frugal atmosphere. (4) The school's sources of funding have been declining recently due to the impact of the world economy and are greatly insufficient. Efforts should be made to raise a fixed endowment fund to consolidate the school's economic foundation. It is hereby ordered to comply with the instructions and report back. This order.</p>

<p>Secretary Zhang, the representative of Mayor Wu, gave a speech, saying that today, on behalf of the mayor, he hopes that everyone will not think that they are teachers and feel wronged to study at the Summer School. They should know that teaching and learning benefit each other and should make redoubled efforts. Second, do not think that elementary school teachers are suffering and belittle themselves. Third, they must recognize that elementary school teachers are actually undertaking work that reaches the people and break the reasons for the failure of the slogans shouted to the people by social activists in China in the past. Fourth, use ten years of recovery and ten years of education to do the work of truly revitalizing the nation. The first step is the most important elementary school teacher. Everyone should cultivate the seeds of the nation and lay the foundation for the future revitalization of the nation. Next, Cai Hongtian, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a speech, saying that elementary school teachers are the parents who instill knowledge into the future masters of the country. Their position is very high, and they should redouble their efforts to cultivate themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Director's Speech <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Then, Director Pan gave a speech, saying that everyone has come here during the summer vacation to seek knowledge and make their future work more progressive. The Education Bureau also organizes the Summer School and Training Class for this purpose. Today, I want to talk to you about the meaning of education. The purpose of education is often different under restrictions, but in principle, no matter what region or time, if the education cause does not go wrong, there will always be a common principle or theory, that is, why the elderly should teach the young. The theory is the same everywhere. Now, let me explain with the words of ancient Chinese educators. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "What Heaven imparts to man is called human nature. To follow our nature is called the Way. Cultivating the Way is called education." To run education, we must first know the personality of the child, the nature of the student. This nature is what Heaven imparts to man. All human beings have a common nature, and each person also has a unique personality. The combination of common nature and unique personality forms each person's nature. Nature is the mandate of Heaven, and the mandate of Heaven is nature. Nature is produced by the natural action of metabolism. Talking about education, if you do not understand the student's nature, you are not an educator. The Way is the road. To follow one's nature is to control one's nature and not let it be unrestrained. Being able to follow one's nature is the Way, so following one's nature is called the Way, even if one's reckless nature is controlled and walks in orbit. Cultivating the Way is called education. Educators are laborers who build roads. The road they build is the road of being a person. The road of being a person is built by those who are engaged in education, but the road of being a person only needs to control one's character to have the Way, and educators must always cultivate the Way, especially it is important to start cultivating from a young age. This is the foundation of all education. Finally, after the teacher representative Guo Yicen gave a speech, a photograph was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e233">The Jiangxi Education Department Plans to Establish 400 Zhongshan People's Schools Province-Wide This Year <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) Jiangxi is the province most deeply affected by bandits. The people's thinking is greatly influenced by their negative impact. The authorities have decided to implement special education in the hope of correcting the people's erroneous thinking, training local self-defense, and increasing rural production, so as to achieve the simultaneous implementation of education, cultivation, and health. The Jiangxi Education Department has now first established special education teacher training classes, research classes, and summer training classes. The first batch of graduates has been assigned to various counties in the recovered areas to run Zhongshan People's Schools. The first phase of the school establishment plan stipulates that a total of 80 schools will be established in 20 counties and districts, all of which are required to be fully established within this month. The second phase will continue to train students, and after graduation, they will be sent to work in various counties. It is expected that 400 Zhongshan People's Schools can be established by the end of this year. After the research class students graduate, they will be sent to work in various counties. It is expected that by July next year, 50 counties will have special education instructors.

<p>First batch on August 14th</p>

<p>The Global China Students Association has recently been very busy preparing for student reception services because many outsiders have requested them to handle study abroad procedures. According to the association's recent survey, from the 22nd year of the Republic to this year, the total number of students going abroad is about 400. Due to the fall in gold prices this year, there are more people requesting to handle departure procedures than in previous years. However, because the Ministry of Education has issued an order restricting graduates from unapproved universities from going abroad, many students still feel disappointed. This summer vacation, a total of more than 100 students will study abroad, with more studying in the United States. They are divided into two batches for departure. The first batch is scheduled to depart on the Hoover President on August 14th, and the second batch is scheduled to depart on the Jackson President on August 21st.</p>

<p>Women's education in our country has a history of several decades, but it has always been an appendage of men's education and has not been valued by people in society. In recent years, laws and regulations stipulate equal educational opportunities for men and women, and women's education has risen from an subordinate position to contend with men's education. What path should it take? This is of great importance to the future of the family and the country. In recent years, due to equal educational opportunities for men and women, schools at all levels have focused on the cultivation of social people and neglected the cultivation of family people. As a result, many women only consume and do not produce, which is not what China needs today. If this continues and no attention is paid, it will harm the family and the country. We believe that the revival of the nation must rely on the development of women's education, and at the same time, we are deeply concerned that today's women's education will become an obstacle to the revival of the nation. Therefore, we advocate that the new trend of women's education in the future should focus on horizontal development and not vertical development. Here are some facts to show the urgency of reforming women's education, and to state the methods and implementation plans for the women's life skills classes that we advocate adding:</p>
<p>(1) At present, women's schools are mired in the principle of equality in men's education, and ignore the differences in physiology and needs between men and women. They focus on the transmission of knowledge and neglect the practice of household affairs. As for female students in co-educational schools, due to uneven levels and differences in abilities, they devote themselves to the study of subjects and rarely have time to pay attention to household affairs. As a result, in fact, women can handle household affairs before entering school, but after entering school, they cannot do anything. Before receiving education, they consume less of the family, but after receiving education, they consume more of the family and become women who are not suitable for the family.</p>
<p>(2) At present, women's schools mostly assign all matters to staff and school workers to handle. Students only enjoy the benefits of life and regard personnel communication as cumbersome etiquette, lazy to practice, and afraid to do it themselves, which invisibly creates bad habits such as dependence, laziness, and simplicity. They have little spirit of hard work and the ability to cope appropriately.</p>
<p>(3) In recent years, women's clothing has been changing every day. As a result, students are also imitating them. They pursue fashion and compete to show off. In their spare time after class, they like to do unnecessary social activities and useless activities. Bad habits follow each other and are now even worse. The school authorities either indulge in the trend or mistakenly believe that the trend cannot be resisted. They ignore it and do not correct it, which leads to the development of romantic, decadent, arrogant, and extravagant bad habits, making the morality of our country gradually decline. In the future, these women will not be able to be virtuous housewives who manage the family, nor will they be able to be kind mothers who care for their children.</p>
<p>(4) The purpose of women learning ordinary sciences is to use them as a foundation for further study of advanced knowledge and as a tool for improving the family's independent livelihood. However, the fact is often the opposite of the purpose. What today's facts tell us is that, except for a few talented women who are ambitious in their careers and can use what they have learned to engage in social services, most women, once they enter the family and have children, often put everything they have learned on the shelf. Social undertakings cannot be participated in due to involvement, and it is not beneficial to improving the family, and it is still useless for seeking a living. What could be more uneconomical than this?</p>
<p>The above-mentioned disadvantages are all facts recognized by society, and are not intentionally pointed out as shortcomings of today's women's education in order to strengthen the credibility of our argument. Nor is it to obliterate the vertical development of all women's education, but to say that women's education should only have horizontal training. The family is the small unit of the society and the country, and the woman is the housewife of the family and the kind mother of the next generation of citizens. Without a good family, how can there be a healthy country and society? Without a virtuous housewife, men will still have worries at home even if they serve outside, and even their careers will be ruined and their character will be degraded. Without beautiful motherhood, no one will model their children's behavior, no one will pay attention to their health, and no one will protect their happiness. The next generation of citizens will receive this bad family education from a young age. What will be the harm to the country and society in the future? Therefore, we believe that the number of women actually engaged in social undertakings is extremely small, and the greatest majority still bear the heavy responsibility of the family. In order to obtain the actual benefits of improving the family and revitalizing the country, the largest majority of women should receive horizontal education and training. Women's education should no longer focus on vertical development, creating a majority of women who only consume and do not produce, putting the family and the country in extreme danger. Furthermore, the good or bad of social customs and habits should be the equal responsibility of men and women. The necessity of improving today's men's education goes without saying. The shortcomings of today's women's education, based on the above, are also undeniable. Since women have lost their nature under bad education, the more developed women's education is, the more romantic and pleasure-seeking women there will be in society. The more such women there are, the worse the social atmosphere will be, and the faster the family will collapse. The cause and effect generate each other, and it will be endless. Therefore, in order to save the declining trends and revive the nation, we do not avoid the general criticism of society and put forward opinions on reforming women's education, and drafted a plan, respectfully inquiring the opinion of enlightened people, and presenting it to the Jiangsu Education Department to first add a junior girls' life school in the provincial Yangzhou Middle School to engage in practical experimentation. The scale is not large, the equipment is not sophisticated, but it is realistic and seeks truth from facts, and establishes a atmosphere. It is hoped that people who are interested in improving women's education will give guidance and support, so that it can be managed perfectly and can be used for observation, so as to be the beginning of saving the bad atmosphere of women's education. If the matter can be implemented and the results are obvious, we are happy, and the future of the family and the country will rely on it. Now the training policy, the main points of the method, and the implementation plan are listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange saw an even more peculiar and unbelievable surge in market conditions. The trading floor became increasingly tense, as if there was still a large surge to come. Therefore, buyers rushed to buy with all their might, showing an unusually strong momentum, unseen in recent years. Based on this phenomenon, it can be inferred that there must be huge real power behind it, causing short sellers to suffer repeated disastrous losses. Such repeated surges were unexpected. The strength of the market participants' resolve seemed unstoppable, with an indomitable momentum. Consolidated Salt Tax was close to 80% of the market price. At the opening in the morning, Troop Reduction immediately rose by one yuan. Afterwards, it rose even more vigorously, from slightly over one yuan to slightly over one yuan and two jiao. When 96 was being traded, it surprisingly surged by four yuan, announcing a limit up. The Financial Long Term followed suit, also rising over four yuan to the limit up. The intensity of the situation was unprecedented. In the next session, Troop Reduction surged another two yuan, starting well from 19. No. 32 gradually saw a large amount of selling, with selling pressure mounting, and the market price also falling more and more sharply. This month's Gold Short fell by as much as one yuan and eight jiao, while the forward contract only fell by nine and a half jiao. No. 32 of Consolidated Land had no more selling. This month's contract rose slightly by two and a half jiao, while the forward contract still rose by eight and a half jiao due to strong demand. 96 Gold Long had no market due to the relationship of consolidation and margin call, but the gray market rose by another one and a half yuan. The result of the full-day market price showed increases ranging from several jiao to four yuan. Among them, Gold Short only rose by one and a half jiao, while Troop Reduction surprisingly rose by three yuan and three jiao. The market price was abnormal and there was still volatility. The total number of transactions was estimated to be over 30 million yuan. The ups and downs are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>The Power of the Bulls is Formidable, Swap Premium is Expected to Rise</p>
<p>The Bears are Anxious, the Market Conditions are Extremely Firm for One Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was approaching the swap date. After carefully examining the lineup of bulls and bears, it seems that the bulls have the possibility of doing the swap. The hedge is only 10 yuan away, and the general large hedge has not been swapped, which is a major threat to the shorts. The market price then rose. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw increases in both the UK and the US. The forward silver price of the Five Metals Exchange was closed. The exchange rate slightly contracted. London raw gold rose by one and a half pence, US cotton fell by four pounds, and US wheat contracted by half a point. The gross price of goods was 812 yuan. Although the pre-market opening of the gold industry was low, the situation was stable. After the opening, the market sentiment suddenly became hot, the exchange market tightened. Chinese merchants vigorously pushed up the price, but because the HSBC bank quote did not change in both the UK and the US, there was still a lot of fluctuation. In the end, due to the swap relationship, the future of the shorts deteriorated. The demand in the market exceeded supply, and the market sentiment was firm. The exchange market also gradually tightened. Chinese merchants continued to vigorously push up the price. In addition, Japanese firms had some settlements, and the gold price gradually broke through the 90 yuan mark. A certain speculator surnamed Wu took the opportunity to supply, and the rising momentum was blocked. Banks also took the opportunity to sell at high prices. The situation turned flat at noon. In the after-market, brokers still bought US dollars, but the banks still had selling appetite, so the market conditions were unstable. The underlying trend of market sentiment was upwards, making it easy to pull up. The domestic market was flat. Although it rose, there was a lot of fluctuation. Large accounts sought to balance supply and demand, but because the psychology of retail investors was very firm, the closing was relatively firm. The market conditions were firm after being flat for one day. There were no special telegrams. It was really because there were too many shorts, with a slight margin call squeeze. However, because most of the short selling prices were all outside the 1000 yuan mark, although there was a trend of margin call squeeze today, it did not affect the whole situation. Otherwise, the situation would be more hot. The swap premium is expected to rise, and the bulls are not letting go. The market conditions are occasionally firm. The price of red gold is 992 yuan and 7 jiao. Tianjin goods are added 10 yuan. The following is a record of the market conditions for the day:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 984 yuan and 2 jiao, slightly down by 4 jiao from last Saturday. The commodity opening was 4 yuan and 2 jiao. The exchange market quoted recent selling prices, with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence 3125, and the US exchange rate at 34 yuan 25. Fuxingyong, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Tongchun, Dakang, and Yiyu all advanced. As Chinese merchants bought, the domestic market also tightened, and the price rose from 3 yuan and 8 jiao to 6 yuan and 5 jiao. Huabei sold September US dollars at 375. Hengyu and Yuqingyong sold off, falling back to 5 yuan and 5 jiao, but market sentiment was extremely strong. The exchange market continued to tighten. Fuxingyong, Shunmao, Yiyu, Tongchun, Hengyu, and Yongde advanced, rising again to 6 yuan and 8 jiao. Anticipating that the HSBC quote would not move, Bingxing and Yongli sold off, falling back to 5 yuan and 7 jiao. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuqingyong, and Xinchang still advanced, pulling up one yuan. Hengyu, Yicheng, Bingxing, Yongde, and Yuanchangyong continued to supply, falling again to within 6 yuan. Market sentiment was still healthy. September US dollars at 375 were difficult to settle. Chunyuanyong, Zhaofengchang, Cuitai, and Yingfenghang continued to advance. Although Dalian merchants Fuxingyong sold, it still saw a gradual increase. Richang, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Hengtai, Hengxingyuan, Yuqingyong, Hengyu Fuyu, Yuankangxiang, Fuxingyong and others bought repeatedly, rising to 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Chinese merchants even bought August US dollars at 1875. Zhaofengchang, Yifengyong, and Yuanyi took the opportunity to supply at high prices, falling to 8 yuan and 2 jiao. Yiyu, Hengyu, Qingfayong, Yingfenghang, Shunmao, Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, Dingkang, Yuanshengyong and others competed to buy. Mitsui ate August US dollars at 125, rising to 90 yuan and 2 jiao. HSBC came out with September US dollars at 25. Huixiang tried hard to sell off and informed downstream. Macquarie sold October US dollars at 375. Shunmao, Huixiang, Hengxing, Hengyu, and Qianchangxiang came to sell, falling to 87 yuan and 4 jiao. Yiyu and Hengxing took the opportunity to buy at low prices, recovering one yuan. Qianchangxiang, Fuchangyong, and Dadecheng still came to sell, and then fell back to 6 yuan and 8 jiao. Chunyuanyong and Dalian merchants made repairs, and the situation was still stable. The noon close was 987 yuan and 4 jiao, and the commodity was auctioned at 7 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 987 yuan and 2 jiao, and the commodity opened at 7 yuan and 2 jiao, then became 7 yuan and 2 jiao. Fuyu, Chunyu, Chunyuanyong, Senchangyong, Shunli, and Yuanshengyong advanced, rising to 8 yuan and 8 jiao. Banks all sold August US dollars at 1875. Fu'an, Hengyu, Wanxing, Fuchang, and Dadecheng sold off, falling to 7 yuan and 2 jiao. At this time, there were rumors that Bombay had contracted and rebounded. Hengyu and Yongli took the opportunity to buy at low prices, rising again to 8 yuan. Fuyu and Tongyi advanced again, rising to 8 yuan and 4 jiao. Zhejiang and Daying came out with October US dollars at 375. Dadecheng sold off, falling to 7 yuan and 7 jiao. Zhengchang, Hengtai, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Fu'an, Yuanchangyong, Yuanheng, and Tongtaichang bought together, rising to 9 yuan and 1 jiao. Qianchangxiang occasionally sold off, and there was still a decline. The market sentiment was stable, so the closing was 988 yuan and 8 jiao, and the commodity was auctioned at 8 yuan and 3 jiao. After the closing, Qianchangxiang, Fuxingyong, Yongde, Fuchang, Richang, Fuyu, commodities and others sold off. Shunmao advanced and then came out, falling back to 8 yuan. The highest price for one day was 990 yuan and 2 jiao, and the lowest price was 983 yuan and 8 jiao, a difference of 6 yuan and 4 jiao. The result was a sudden increase of 4 yuan and 2 jiao compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The closing price used the Jiufeng Bank's US exchange rate, which remained unchanged, still calculated at 33 yuan and 875, equivalent to a margin gold price of 1021 yuan and 4 jiao. According to the closing price, the approximate margin was 32 yuan, a decrease of more than 4 yuan compared to last Saturday. Fourteen short-term contracts for this month have been cleared. The August account was registered at 987 yuan. The morning margin call was 986 yuan, and the afternoon margin call was 988 yuan. The price of red gold was 992 yuan and 7 jiao. Only 70 contracts were sold by the Tianjin gang to Dafenghang in the market, with an additional 10 yuan. Another 4,000 taels of spot goods have arrived at the port, but the situation for the August-September swap is particularly unfavorable to the short side. There is a rumor in the market that the bulls are forming a company to do the swap, which is also actually possible. The bulls in the big accounts are strong, and the consecutive hedges are squeezing in. At present, they are only about 10 yuan away, and the positions of the Dalian gang and others have increased rather than decreased, which requires the attention of general shorts. It is predicted that the swap to be held this Saturday will be posted by the short side at a price of 7-8 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market is still strong, and the buying momentum is particularly strong. In summary, Qingfayong Shunmao, Hengyu, Yiyu, Senchangyong, Hengxingyuan, Dingtai, Yongde, Chunyuanyong, Yuanchun, Xianghe Fu'an, Zhaofengchang, Cuitai, Yuanshengyong, Yuankangxiang, Yuanchangyong, Fuxingyong, Shunli, and Wanxing are on the buying side. Yifengyong, Huixiang, Bingxing, Yongli, Yicheng, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Yuanyi, Yongfengcheng, Tongfenghang, Yuanyuan, Dacheng, Yingxiang, Ruixing, Fuchang, Yongfeng, Qingyu, and Rui are on the selling side. Huixiang, Tongtaichang, Yuqingyong, Fuyu, Yuanmaoyong, and Yingfenghang first came out and then advanced. Dalian gang Shunli did a total of 2,000, squeezing in more than 300 contracts. Wanxing did a total of more than 1,700 contracts, squeezing in less than 100. The Guang gang Shengtian did not trade much. Hengxing traded about 100 contracts each. The total number of August contracts was 41,650, with a total of 38 bulls and 64 shorts. The total number of transactions on that day was 42,665 in the morning and 11,697 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>During the prosperous seasons of summer and autumn in Shanghai, every Monday, the bank opening and closing and settlement procedures are naturally complicated, and the trading situation is also very busy, and the market sentiment is also very high. However, in the summer, especially during the current hot season, regardless of whether it is the beginning of the week, it always feels more idle than usual. Therefore, although yesterday was Monday, the settlement felt quite desolate. Market sentiment in the market was sluggish, and there was no competition for foreign exchange dismantling from beginning to end. As a result, both the morning and afternoon markets were the same at 0.05%, and the headline splitting was also in vain without adding water. In terms of dismantling ticket transactions, the morning market transferred 3.5 million, the new transaction was 400,000. Afternoon transactions were 200,000. Transactions in the Small General Assembly were 300,000. Transactions in foreign mortgages only made a new 400,000, and the number of redemptions was also small, only 800,000. Banknotes recovered 600,000, issued 1.2 million, customer sources were 300,000, and 150,000 went away. In terms of bank settlement, foreign banks settled more than 2.8 million in ticket funds, more than 4.45 million in various goods exchange mortgages, more than 600,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, more than 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlement funds, and 800,000 in warehouse out. Chinese banks settled more than 3.2 million in ticket funds, more than 4.3 million in various goods exchange tax mortgages, 300,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, and 400,000 in warehouse in. Japanese banks settled more than 3.1 million in ticket funds, more than 4.4 million in various goods exchange mortgages, more than 300,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, more than 1.3 million in foreign exchange settlement funds, and 300,000 in warehouse in. Money houses and foreign public lists settled more than 41 million, foreign headline funds settled more than 5.7 million, and various exchange funds were more than 500,000. Settlement of cash was straightened. The total number of exchanges in the city's clearing house was 8,869,586.36 silver dollars, including 4,741,214.37 silver dollars, and 4,128,371.99 silver dollars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the difference between the morning and afternoon markets of Jiangnan small dollars was estimated to be 2 yuan, with the morning market at 836 yuan and the afternoon market at 838 yuan. The transaction was 2,500 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small dollars were 729 yuan and 4 jiao in the morning market and 729 yuan in the afternoon market. The result was a decrease of 1 yuan compared to the afternoon market the previous day. The transaction was 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were released for 1,500 wen, for 331,500 wen. The transaction was 31,492 strings and 500 wen, estimated to be worth 9,500 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is calm and the situation is still good. Because the amount absorbed by the buyers has remained unchanged, the trading floor is relatively dry and transactions are not smooth. The intention of the bullish speculators is to remain firm. (1) Rumors about a certain factory are rampant, causing market sentiment to be unsettled. Secondly, the weather is extremely hot, and the yarn mill's output has decreased, so the pulling force is getting tighter. However, spot yarn sales are sluggish, and the price of Japanese yarn is relatively loose, which has affected the market.</p>

<p>The cotton market opened in the morning, and although the US and Indian cotton markets fell, there was a shortage of sellers in the market, and the bullish speculators closed off the amount they absorbed. As a result, the trading floor was relatively tight, so each month rose by 5-6 jiao. Until the closing of the third round of auction, it was heard that the spot yarn sales market was not smooth and market sentiment was slightly soft. As a result, each month rose by 1, 2, and 4 jiao. In the afternoon, the market was closed due to the hot weather and there was no auction. The statistics for the half-day transaction were 13,700 bales. The sales records showed that Junchang sold 400 bales, Junchang sold 750 bales, Senkang sold 800 bales, Renfeng sold 900 bales, Taichang sold 600 bales, Yichang sold 750 bales, Xiecheng sold 450 bales, and Xincheng sold 500 bales.

<p>The cotton market is trending firm and the rising momentum is rising again. Because the climate is dry, the cotton trees are affected, so market sentiment is strong again and the buying momentum is even stronger. However, the overseas cotton market feels very weak and Japanese merchants have no intention of buying. The future direction still depends on the ups and downs of foreign cotton.</p>

<p>The cotton market opened in the morning and the situation was relatively high. Because there was a lack of sellers and the weather was extremely hot, there was a lack of rainfall, and bullish speculators were active again, so although the US and Indian cotton markets fell, market sentiment was tight and each month rose by 2, 3, and 4 jiao. However, it was slightly weak at the close of the auction. The statistics for the entire day showed that 35,600 dan were traded.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed signs of rising again. The quotation for foreign wheat was different in Chicago and Canada, by about a fraction of a cent to 1 jiao. However, the drought has lasted for more than 20 days, and there has been no rain in this port. The price of rice in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been rising step by step. Because part of the waterway in this port has been cut off, market participants are anxious and the price of rice is very good. Yesterday, because it was called up by another 5-6 jiao, although the quoted price in the flour market did not have the smooth movement of actual sales, market sentiment was good. Bullish speculators in this and other ports were unusually prosperous, so the quoted price was raised wildly by 4-5 points. Later, factories such as Fu Fu and others released files one after another, and the market momentum was slightly flattened. That is, many retail bullish speculators also closed, but most of them were absorbed by large accounts. In this environment, even if sales in the north are always sluggish, it is easy to be manipulated by speculative bullish speculators. As a result, this month rose by 0.325 compared to the previous week, August rose by 0.425, September and October rose by 0.475, November rose by 0.425, and December rose by 0.45.</p>
<h3 id="e256">News of Wheat Procurement: Standard Price Rises by 89 Points <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market showed a consistent upward trend. Due to the prolonged sunny weather and inevitable drought, although wheat production was abundant, rice prices soared, thus boosting the market. Furthermore, reports indicated that the government would procure wheat as a form of relief. In such tense times, this move would only provoke more resentment from the public regarding consumption. However, opportunistic merchants, encouraged by these rumors, naturally became more excited. Therefore, at the opening bell, traders covered their shorts, and outside investors rushed to buy, causing the market to surge. Trading was even more active in the afternoon. Near-term trends leveled off slightly, while long-term trends continued to look promising. Considering the prolonged drought, the market may continue to rise further. As a result, the current month rose by five points, August/September rose by six points, October rose by seven points, and November rose by nine points. Currently, wheat arrivals at the source are still robust. Over the past two days, approximately 50,000 bags have arrived. Due to high rice prices and good quality standards, each grade rose by five points. Wheat from Bengbu, Linhuai Guan, and Mingguang opened at 3.05 yuan, wheat from Yaowan at 3.04 yuan, wheat from Xuzhou at 3.07 yuan, wheat from Southern Suzhou at 3.06 yuan, wheat from Huangqiao at 2.77 yuan, wheat from Gaoyou at 2.956 yuan, wheat from Daqiao at 2.93 yuan, wheat from Dezhou at 2.87 yuan (secondary grade at 2.83 yuan), wheat from Zhenjiang at 2.85 yuan, and wheat from Luhe at 2.93 yuan, totaling 32,000 bags. Fuxin took 20,000 bags, Fufeng took 8,000 bags, Shenda took 3,000 bags, and Xinda took 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, various sources from the 17th and 18th (approximately 3,000 shi of goods).</p>
<p>Due to the prolonged drought, market sentiment was bullish. After a wave of price increases, the limited arrivals made the market even more attractive. Once trading began, prices jumped sharply. Although out-of-town buyers did not continue to place bulk orders, local buyers were eager to purchase. Market conditions improved, and late rice and thick japonica prices soared by five to six jiao. Improved Du, Yang, and sharp rice varieties also rose by two to three jiao.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, over a dozen sources from Hexia arrived. Over a hundred boats were stockpiled in Hexia. Various goods in the market continued to be sold. Due to the drought, sentiment from out-of-town buyers was bullish, causing the prices of white japonica and white round rice, as well as thin rice, to jump by five to six jiao. Early rice followed suit, rising by three to four jiao. Improved Yang and sharp rice were scarce and sold quickly, with prices increasing by six to seven jiao. Buyers from other ports were also actively purchasing sharp rice, raising prices by two to three jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Indica Rice: Yesterday, the foreign indica rice market saw a sudden and significant change. Due to the prolonged drought, a drought situation had developed in the mainland countryside, leading to unusual fragility in public sentiment. If the drought continued, this year's autumn harvest would be hopeless. Inland waterways were drying up, and grain prices had already soared and were expected to rise further. Yesterday, rice merchants from various locations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing routes came to Shanghai to procure supplies. Local traders and hoarders also took the opportunity to buy. With competition from all three parties, market prices soared. In the afternoon, competition was fierce, and riding on the bullish trend from the previous day, the prices of all types of milled rice jumped across the board. The supply of small milled rice was dwindling. Subsequent arrivals were subject to new taxes, further boosting market sentiment. Initially, prices rose to around eight yuan, then briefly climbed to 8.25 yuan, a jump of approximately six jiao compared to the end of last week. Afterward, some bulls sold, resulting in a small pullback of five points. Other indica varieties rose by four to five jiao and two to three jiao. Hunan machine-oiled rice reached as high as 8.9 yuan, and bulk milled rice also rose to 6.7 yuan. For the entire day, 15,000 bags of small milled rice and approximately 13,000 bags of machine-milled rice were traded, distributed among local traders, mainland buyers, and hoarders.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market saw little change compared to the previous week. This was reportedly due to weak demand from factories, making it difficult for sellers to maintain high prices, thus stagnating the market. Currently, price fluctuations in the soybean market depend entirely on the strength of factory demand. Therefore, the price fluctuations were not significant. Yesterday, factories purchased three truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans at 2.65 yuan and 2.64 yuan. They also purchased two truckloads of Quanhe soybeans at 2.7 yuan. Local traders and retail buyers purchased two truckloads of Zhengyangguan soybeans at prices ranging from 2.84 yuan to 2.88 yuan, and one truckload of Feihe soybeans at 2.77 yuan.</p>

<p>The quantity of new Guangdong twigs arriving the day before yesterday was less than the number of boxes retained. Yesterday, all of them were released. Dachao twigs were priced at 24.6 yuan, and Gaozhuang black leaf twigs at 34 yuan. Market trends are still being monitored. It is expected that the official new Jinshan twigs will arrive in approximately three to four days.</p>

<p>The first batch of new golden needle products, totaling 143 pieces, arrived from Zhenjiang. The quality was good and sold out immediately after being released, with Guangdong buyers making the most purchases. The price was 22 yuan, and the market was brisk.</p>

<p>Reduction in Import Tax on Rayon: Since the amendment and promulgation of our country's new tariff regulations, the import tax on rayon has been reduced. Imports of Japanese rayon have increased. In the past three to four days, Japanese ships have brought over 500 boxes of rayon from brands such as Sakura, Toyo, and Ginger Girl. Japanese merchants are actively selling them secretly. Reportedly, a certain silk weaving factory recently purchased over a hundred boxes. Therefore, European and American rayon sales have seen little improvement.</p>
<p>Spring Cocoons from Jiangsu Province Nearing Completion of Transportation: This year's spring cocoons in Jiangsu Province have all had bumper harvests. The fresh cocoons collected by silk cocoon merchants have all been dried. Recently, over 52,000 dan of spring dried cocoons from Jiangsu Province have been transported to Shanghai. Currently, only over 4,000 dan remain in cities such as Wuxi, stored in warehouses and not yet transported. The rest have all been loaded. European and American Silk Telegrams Show No Sign of Transfer to Shanghai: In the overseas raw silk market, silk factories are currently unable to sell their products, and silk prices continue to fall. New factories in Shanghai have sent telegrams but have not seen any transfers. European sales are quiet, and silk merchants have no interest in purchasing. Yesterday, only Yin Zhuang and others purchased eight bales of yellow and white coarse silk at stable and weak prices.</p>
<p>Summer Cocoons in Zhejiang and Hangzhou are Scarce and of Poor Quality: This year's summer silkworms in various cities and villages in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, are all locally bred varieties. The initial season was very good. However, around the time of the great sleep, the weather was unusually hot and dry, and there was no rain in the summer, causing mulberry leaves to wither. The silkworms suffered from hunger and disease, and many were discarded. The new cocoons have already entered the market, but only about 30% are of good quality, and the cocoons are thin and of poor quality. Silk merchants have not yet started weighing and pricing. Farmers and silkworm breeders are preparing to dry and reel their own silk for sale.</p>
<p>New Doupion Silk is of Excellent Quality: This year's spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are abundant and of excellent quality, and the Doupion cocoons are also good. The new silk reeled by Doupion silk factories is of excellent quality, and demand from India is still strong. The British ship Peel, which departed the other day, carried 18 pieces of new Doupion silk, which were transported to England for transfer to India.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sales of fine eyebrow and pearl tea from Luzhuang and Pingshui to French traders became more active. Top and middle-grade goods from Wuyuan and Tunxi were particularly popular. The entire city traded over 1,800 boxes of green tea. Except for Gongxi, which fell by five to six yuan, the market was generally stable. The black tea market, on the other hand, was slightly sluggish. Trade in goods from Qimen and Fuliang was sparse. Although there were sporadic sales of coarse goods from Hunan and Hubei provinces, prices were expected to continue to fall due to abundant inventory.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Hardware: British Tinplate in Short Supply <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Since German and French goods entered the Shanghai tinplate market, British goods have been implicitly eliminated. This is because their costs are higher than those of German and French goods. However, American goods, due to their superior quality, remain outstanding. Although prices are more expensive than those of German and French goods, customers are still happy to purchase them. However, in recent days, negotiations for British goods have become increasingly frequent. This is because foreign merchants still remember British goods. As a result, their remaining inventory is decreasing, and the number of buyers is increasing. Therefore, quoted prices have improved compared to before. Ninety-pound boxes are estimated at 15.25 yuan, and 100-pound boxes at 16 yuan. Reportedly, there are only about 100 boxes available, and another 300 boxes are expected to arrive in 20 days as futures.</p>

<h3 id="e265">Worries <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Huaibai</p>
<p>In the second act of Bernard Shaw's play *Pygmalion*, when the dustman Doolittle asks Professor Higgins for five pounds for his daughter, Higgins takes out his wallet and doubles the amount to ten pounds. However, the hardworking dustman refuses to accept it, saying the following:</p>
<p>"No, Governor. She's not heart enough to spend ten pounds, and perhaps I haven't neither. Ten pounds is too much; it makes you feel like worriting; then all the happiness is gone. You give me what I asked you for, Governor; not a penny more, not a penny less." (Slightly modified from Lin Yutang's translation)</p>
<p>To ordinary vulgar people, the dustman is either a fool or someone from an almost utopian gentleman's country. In fact, neither is true of the dustman's view; rather, his view comes from his rich life experience. Once the secrets of life are revealed, they all amount to the same thing; money is no exception. The difference between humans and animals is minimal, and some may think that this difference is the addition of (money). However, this explanation is inadequate. Poor people never break this riddle. When there is not much money, they are busy with petty gains; when there is too much money, they worry about how to manage and dispose of it. Starting with worries and ending with worries, decades of life pass by without a moment of peace of mind, which is truly pointless! The instinctive life of other animals is vastly different from our divinely blessed humanity, but they are superior in that they have no worries. Therefore, the last stanza of William Blake's poem about a fly is:</p>
<p>Then am I</p>
<p>If I live, or if I die.</p>
<p>We want to cast aside all worries and be happy flies. However, in this vast world, it is probably impossible to find many people who are completely free of worries in body and mind. Even the tiny fly is proud.</p>

<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>I live in a hotel facing the harbor in Xiamen. When I'm lonely, I open the window and look out. The Western-style buildings and green shade on the slopes of Gulangyu are like someone using painting techniques, clearly displayed on the water across from me, revealing a charming style that captivates the eye. The sound of oars often comes from below the window. Just by sticking my head out, I can see boat after boat of wealthy men and women, dressed in splendid clothes, like flowers adorning the harbor. They are either going from Xiamen to Gulangyu or coming from Gulangyu to Xiamen for fun.</p>
<p>Just by taking a trip to Gulangyu, you will feel that it is indeed suitable for wealthy people to live in. The roads along the coast or climbing up the slopes have a quiet and elegant southern flavor. Some villa windows with white curtains quietly peek at the slowly walking tourists from the sparse branches and leaves of the trees. There is simply no noise from carriages and horses or the hustle and bustle of the city. Perhaps you can only hear the sea breeze slowly passing through the woods all day, and the laughter of schoolchildren floating in the streets in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>When I went to visit, I planned to exchange one or two foreign banknotes brought back from Southeast Asia, because I assumed that banks like HSBC were located in the concession of Gulangyu. However, after searching around, I only found Chinese-owned banks. Foreign financial institutions like HSBC, on the other hand, were located in the comparatively unsafe city of Xiamen. From this, it seems that it is indeed the Chinese themselves who need safety. When I returned from Southeast Asia earlier, I took a ship belonging to overseas Chinese and saw the flag of Great Britain raised when it docked in Xiamen. I felt quite strange in my heart. But after visiting Gulangyu and glimpsing the ancient China, my thoughts of blaming others completely disappeared. I was just thinking:</p>
<p>(Old China, it seems that only your barefooted loving children are still full of longing for you.)</p>
<p>Mr. Yu: Your work (Huang) was sent in May. Because I wanted to publish it when the weather was (hot), I put it in a special place. When it was published on the 6th, it was taken from this special collection. (Torch) When the manuscript was published in early June, the editor was ill and did not pay attention. The letter saying to submit the manuscript elsewhere was probably lost. In addition to stopping the publication of the second half as ordered, I hereby reply publicly to clarify that Mr. did not (submit the same manuscript twice) and to clear up misunderstandings from all parties. - Editor</p>
<h3 id="e268">The Problem of Jin Shengtan's Consciousness <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Erye</p>
<p>(Infinitesimal theory) has already hit a wall, and the faces of Jin Shengtan's disciples are a bit collapsed. What opportunity should we find to defend Elder Jin again? Thus, Mr. Yu Yangling's article came out.</p>
<p>Jin Shengtan put *Water Margin* and *Zuo Zhuan* and *Lisao* together, and respected them as (talented books), which has no malice, but is a very correct view, just like today's critics value novels that describe rickshaw pullers. As for (talented books), it's just a common abuse of language by the Ming people, just like today's people say (genius) (great man) at every turn. (See the July 4th Free Talk, Mr. Yu's original text.)</p>
<p>What does this passage mean? Did I say that Jin Shengtan had malice? Did I say that his view was incorrect? I did not! I am only pointing out what kind of consciousness Jin Shengtan belongs to. From the perspective of the noble class, yes, Jin Shengtan is (without malice, but a very correct view). As for (today's critics) or (Ming people's abuse of language) or something, it is naturally correct; but it does not prove that Elder Jin's consciousness does not belong to the noble class. However, Mr. Yu still has an article defending Jin Shengtan's consciousness below.</p>
<p>If Jin Shengtan had used the (consciousness of the noble class) to select books, he would never have selected *Water Margin*. Furthermore, he selected *Water Margin* and deleted the purely story-concatenated one hundred and twenty chapters into seventy chapters. This is a purposeful work, the purpose of which is to expose the darkness of bureaucratic politics, point out the social causes of the Liangshanpo group, and praise the righteousness of the vagrant class.</p>
<p>Indeed, (this is a purposeful work), but unfortunately, the (purpose) mentioned here is only something that Mr. Yu has come up with now in order to defend Elder Jin; Jin Shengtan himself did not say this. Twenty years ago, I read Jin Shenghuan's preface to *Water Margin* (seal Hangu Pass with mud pellets) (that is, use *Water Margin* to stop the chaos of the world). Unfortunately, I have forgotten it now. I still remember a bit of the meaning of other annotations, so I will bring it up for Mr. Yu to see.</p>
<p>Lin Chong was the first to go to Liangshan. His nickname is called (Leopard Head). Why is he called (Leopard Head)? Jin Shengtan's great insight: Leopards eat their parents, which is the same as wicked people without father or king. The bandits on Liangshan are all without father or king, all leopards. Lin Chong was the first to go up the mountain, and also one of the leaders, so he is called (Leopard Head). How different is this saying from what Mr. Yu is saying now! As for the reason why (if Jin Shengtan had used the consciousness of the noble class to select books), (he would never have selected *Water Margin*), Mr. Yu did not say, so I have to omit it). Let's see Mr. Yu's next article:</p>
<p>He wrote Song Jiang in the story as very loyal and righteous, but ridiculed him for wanting to be recruited to the imperial court, making him worthless. I ask, what kind of consciousness is this.</p>
<p>From these few sentences, I almost suspect that Mr. Yu is reading another kind of Jin annotated *Water Margin*. It is true that Jin Shengtan ridiculed Song Jiang, but what he ridiculed is exactly the opposite of what Mr. Yu said, not (very loyal and righteous, but hoping to be recruited to the imperial court); rather, he ridiculed Song Jiang for being very falsely loyal and righteous, deceiving people with the desire to be recruited, and actually willing to be a bandit. I suppose more than just Mr. Yu and I have read Jin annotated *Water Margin*. (I ask, what kind of consciousness is this)? I answer: This is the consciousness of the noble class, without a doubt. Below, after Mr. Yu quoted a large section of Jin Shengtan's words, he said:</p>
<p>This section explains the infinite exploitation under bureaucratic politics and its inevitable results. How can it be said to be out of (the consciousness of the noble class?)</p>
<p>It's really strange. On what basis does Mr. Yu determine that no one in the noble class is against (infinite exploitation under bureaucratic politics)? And on what basis does he determine that opposing (infinite) exploitation also necessarily opposes (limited) exploitation? In fact, among the noble class, there are many who oppose (infinite) and hope for (limited). The earliest were Confucius and Mencius. Confucius wanted people to be good people, and Mencius wanted people to live good lives. There is not a single sentence in their works that supports exploitation; on the contrary, there are many sentences that oppose exploitation. But they all belong to the consciousness of the noble class. Enough small talk, let's copy some of Mr. Yu's quoted Jin Shengtan's words:</p>
<p>Alas! The world is the world of the imperial court, and the people are the children of the imperial court; but now let loose unlimited tigers and wolves, open unlimited greedy mouths, take unlimited muscle, fill unlimited ravines, and want the people not to rebel, and the country not to perish, how can this be!</p>
<p>Full of (imperial court) (imperial court) (I ask, what kind of consciousness is this)? I answer: How can it be said that this is not out of the consciousness of the noble class?</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>First, Jin Shengtan's consciousness is the consciousness of the noble class.</p>
<p>Second, it cannot be said that Jin Shengtan's consciousness is not out of the noble class.</p>
<p>Third, Jin Shengtan's consciousness is different from what Mr. Yu has determined.</p>

<p>— Caoming</p>
<p>When the doctor finished the examination and said that the child was already more than two months old, I was so angry that my eyes almost popped out of their sockets. The woman sat there as if numb from exhaustion, recounting without any panic that she had discussed with a sick woman next door—the child's mother—because of hunger. As a result, she spent a few copper coins to buy a bowl of pig's blood and smeared it on the child's head. Then, she carried the child and ran to Pingxi Lane.</p>
<p>(Sir, if you had come one step later, I could have had a full meal tonight, and the child's mother could have had a doctor examine her pulse. (But do you know that you are deceiving people? Do you know that you are breaking the law?)</p>
<p>(Really, I don't know what you mean by breaking the law.)</p>
<p>I remembered the suffering of illiterate people and deliberately explained to her calmly: (The law is to protect the interests of the people and guarantee their peace. For example, now you have broken the law and cheated people out of money. I have to take you to the Public Security Bureau to be punished...)</p>
<p>(Oh, I understand this law. But if I am punished, who is it protecting—why don't you want my interests, sir?)</p>
<p>I scratched my head and said after a while: (Everyone. To prevent everyone from being deceived!) I was very satisfied with my answer.</p>
<p>(Why doesn't the law let me have a good bowl of peaceful food, why doesn't it let the child's mother not be sick? Sir, how dare I say that you are also deceiving me?)</p>
<p>(Quickly carry the child, take the money you cheated, and come with me to the district!) I remember shouting at her like that.</p>
<p>When we turned to the secluded Panfu Road, I stopped, took out the only one yuan note from my pocket, handed it to her, and said to her encouragingly in a low tone: (Consider me unlucky today! But after you go back, you must fix yourself and be a law-abiding citizen!) That's how we parted ways. You can imagine how soft my heart is!</p>
<p>(If I want to play the trick again, where can I bother you for another yuan, sir?) This light sentence was raised behind me. When I turned my head, there was not a single ghost shadow left.</p>
<p>Fusheng, do you plan to do some charity work? Do you think you are saving someone? But you are wrong. You seem not to know the saying: Compassion is squatting at the feet of the law. Understand? Yes, you still need to train more!)</p>
<p>Our district chief said to me like this, and then he honestly started training me. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e270">Has Science Gone Bankrupt? <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Han Bai</p>
<p>Breaking the sixty-year high temperature record, the long days of red light, the blue starry sky, slowly passing day and night. This has shocked the brains and hearts of every farmer in the countryside. It seems that this year will be a year of famine!</p>
<p>As a result, the so-called humanitarians and superstitious people are blowing their (praying for rain) methods. In Jiangyin, led by gentleman Zhu Danqing, they invited the chief of the Public Security Bureau and the county magistrate to participate together. Wuxi, Changzhou... are also similarly prohibiting slaughter and piously hoping that God can show some kindness. What is this phenomenon! We clearly know that this is an era of the 20th century, the era of the most developed science, an era in which people have been liberated from the iron chains of nature's control over humanity. Science tells us that (rain) is a natural phenomenon, formed by water vapor encountering cold. If we want to hope for rain through human power, it will never be effective through superstition and religion. We must use the already developed science to control nature. According to recent Soviet communications: the success of rainmaking machines is a very obvious example.</p>
<p>Then why do the general superstitious fanatics do that? I think they want to greatly reduce the age of the century to hundreds of years ago, so that the people return to the Middle Ages; they want to deny science, no, they want to destroy science. Because science imposes a task of movement on the fate of society; while superstition forever declares the death penalty of the poor masses as slaves.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, superstition is the spiritual tool of deceivers, and the vanguard of anti-science. In any era, when the poor masses begin to think about the real reasons for their plight, the superstitious people feel very unfavorable. Therefore, in this society, in order to divert the attention of these poor masses from the examination of material life on earth; and to shift the emotions of dissatisfaction with the present world to the hope of the afterlife, superstition is the most powerful tool, which is the fact that history tells us. For example, (praying for rain)! It is very obvious that local leaders are giving the people an empty sesame ball to eat, obscuring the truth that human power can overcome natural control. The face of superstition is most clearly exposed here.</p>
<p>Are we willing to heartlessly let science go bankrupt? Are we willing to be attacked by reactionary forces? No, we should maintain science and defend science, the condition is that everyone bravely raises the banner of anti-superstition.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Praying for Rain <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The summer in Jiangnan, the sun burns fiercely on the earth; a scorching wind blows through the rural areas and urban alleys of Jiangnan. For the past week, the atmospheric pressure has consistently been above one hundred degrees. Not a single drop of rain has fallen, and people are longing to see the sweet rain. (Hoping for clouds in a great drought!) Rain has become the most precious treasure. In the season of yellow plums, who would have thought there would be such a severe drought? The paths in the countryside have all cracked open. The wind blowing on people is scalding hot. In the desolate wilderness, the leaves on the treetops and the sprouts on the ground have all withered; the seedlings in the fields have all dried up. Farmers have nowhere to draw water from, and can only sigh as they look at the withered seedlings!</p>
<p>Alas! The drought has arrived, and a year of famine is upon us! The harvest for the year is gone; heaven is truly trying to take the lives of the poor!</p>
<p>Isn't that so? Rice prices have suddenly soared in the past few days. In less than a week, they have already increased by three or four yuan per stone. Doesn't this make life even harder for the poor?</p>
<p>One clear morning, the sun had just peeked half its face from the east: Uncle A-liu, with a face full of worry, walked out of a dilapidated thatched hut and went to the open space in front of his door. He saw Jin Gou—his son—and A-cui, the daughter of Old Wang next door, chasing a pair of butterflies in the grass. He glared at them fiercely, ready to vent a bellyful of sorrow on Jin Gou.</p>
<p>"Getting up so early, not staying in the nice house, but coming outside to wander! Not even afraid of the dew, getting your clothes wet, does your mother have time to wash them for you? Anyway, there's no rice today, and the pumpkins are still flowering; looks like you'll have to go hungry! All you know is how to play all day long, and then you cry for food when you're hungry. A-yin is only nine years old, and she helps Mom cut grass for the sheep and gather firewood, unlike you naughty things; soon, you’ll be gone; if this drought continues like this, I'll have to make you a monk."</p>
<p>After he scolded them for a long time, they both made a face at him and slipped into the thatched hut.</p>
<p>He walked along the bank of the pond in front of the village. An endless sandy embankment stretched out before him; a row of drooping willows leaned listlessly on the riverbank. The water in the river had dried up, leaving only a little at the bottom, and the water color had turned red. A foul smell rose directly from the bottom of the river, which was quite unpleasant.</p>
<p>Over there, in the endless fields, the clods of soil had turned white. He shook his head as he looked at this scene. Disappointed grief constantly attacked his heart. He was disappointed; a year's worth of his sweat had been dried up by the sun! He slowly raised his head and looked at the vast sky; there were no clouds, no wind, only an iron-like blue sky, and a round of red-hot sun, gradually rising above the horizon.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard news that had just arrived from the tea house in town: This was good news, and anyone who heard it would show a hint of a happy smile on their worried faces.</p>
<p>It was said that the county government had issued a notice today because the weather was severely dry and the people were about to face famine again. All the flowers and trees were about to dry up, so groups of farmers were marching to the county seat to petition for a ban on slaughtering animals and to piously pray for rain. Their only reason was this: praying for rain was not superstitious, because the capital was still asking Master XX to pray for rain. This was because the National Government cared for and loved the people.</p>
<p>The county magistrate and other officials discussed the matter and found no way to refute their reasons. In order to hear the villagers shout "Upright Magistrate," they agreed to ban slaughtering animals for a week. At the same time, they invited Grand Master XX and others to set up an altar in the suburbs about ten miles west of the county seat to pray for rain. They had chosen XX month XX day to open the altar at dawn. Grand Master XX would preside over the altar, leading the entire group of Dharma Masters to piously perform rituals, give speeches, and pray. On this day, the county magistrate, the committee members of the Party branch, and the local gentry would all take time out of their busy schedules to attend. The ceremony would, of course, be extremely grand.</p>
<p>Master XX, wearing his kasaya and holding a sword, ascended the altar, chanting words in his mouth. The other Dharma Masters all echoed him in the same way. The instruments clanged and clattered, shaking the sky. He slammed a spirit tablet in his hand. The scorching sun beat down on their bald heads, and beads of sweat fell like broken strings of pearls. The county magistrate, the Party committee officials, and several famous</p>
<p>Continued on page three</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Local gentry, however, all sat in sedan chairs and returned to their official residences to fan themselves with electric fans and drink iced soda. All that was left here were seven bald heads and some ignorant villagers. However, one day, two days, three days passed, and the heavens still showed no sign of rain. A round of red-hot sun still glared menacingly at them. In the sky, only some gossamer floated, flying quickly outside the blue sky.</p>
<p>The Dharma Masters felt infinitely ashamed! The county magistrate, the Party committee officials, and the local gentry all showed disappointed faces.</p>
<p>Uncle A-liu, like the other farmers, had a layer of disappointed grief and anxious expressions on his face! It still didn't look like rain would fall any time soon.</p>
<p>Alas! Heaven nourishes people as one raises an elephant, but people need to raise snakes! There's nothing one can do when Heaven wants to take from people. Finally, tearful faces and anxious hearts intertwined and flowed under the scorching sun!</p>
<h3 id="e272">Death of Siblings <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Hei</p>
<p>The death of my siblings has brought me grief for the fourth time now!</p>
<p>My third younger sister died when my family was going bankrupt. Since she was a child, she was a lively and playful child. At that time, the family didn't have money to send her to school after she graduated from elementary school, and she was also a student who didn't like sitting on a cold bench listening to poorly taught books by rural teachers. She said it wasn't interesting. She wanted to contract an illness caused by the fatigue of traveling, and treat it so that her chest and heart burned like fire; another so-called famous doctor was changed to use cool medicine to treat it, and she was thus killed alive! From her illness to her death, I was by her side. That kind of tragic situation didn't make me sad, but rather made me resentful. The so-called doctors were actually murderous executioners!</p>
<p>My fifth younger brother died when I left my hometown to study outside. When I heard the news of his death, I cried! Why did he die? He also stayed at home after graduating from elementary school without going to school, and because of this he was stimulated by the family and died of lung disease. He was very gentle. After graduating from elementary school, he went to work as an apprentice in a relative's shop, but he lost his job after half a year and couldn't find anything to do again; when he returned home, his mother—my stepmother—nagged and scolded him all day long, not earning money and only eating, causing him to worry and shed tears and only endure scolding; soon, lung disease developed, and he had no interest in life, so he didn't tell anyone and waited to die. A child in his teens was vomiting blood and waiting to die all day long, but his father didn't know, and his mother didn't care about him, until he died with a bitter smile to his family, what a sad thing this is!</p>
<p>Because of the death of three younger siblings, I often said to my father that he should educate and take care of his younger siblings, but recently I received a letter from home that my tenth younger brother had died again! My tenth younger brother was only seven or eight years old the year I left home—I've been away from home for eight or nine years now—last year he gave me a letter saying that he was about to graduate from elementary school, and I liked him, I often played; but he could make trains, steamships, and guns at home, he was a person with a talent for machine manufacturing. I often said to my father, let my third younger brother go to electrical engineering school, and he will definitely be an engineer in the future; but because of economic reasons, he was not even sent to high school. He liked to play, so he fell ill after falling while playing soccer, but he didn't dare to tell his father that he was injured. A quack doctor in the countryside treated him as an ordinary fever, and when he became seriously ill, he treated him as a cold, until he went crazy and died. Half of his death was his own fault, and half was the quack doctor's fault. At first, I didn't know when I was outside. When I came back to see him when he was critically ill, there was no way to save him, watching him die in the pain of frantic screaming. The death of my third younger sister made me hate quack doctors; but there was also the death of my second younger sister, which made me hate quack doctors even more deeply.</p>
<p>My second younger sister returned to her hometown from a school in a distant place where tuition and board were free during the summer vacation. At that time, I was teaching elementary school in my own village. As soon as she got home, she fell ill. I didn't trust the doctors who were usually invited at home, so I specially invited a so-called famous doctor to see her. Unexpectedly, this so-called famous doctor was also a good-for-nothing. After he took her pulse, he said that she had overworked herself at school and was weak, so he used tonic medicine, giving her a normal</p>
<p>Communicated with him, I told him a lot of knowledge outside of books; this spring, my father reluctantly managed to let him go to the newly established junior high school in his hometown, I sent him two dollars to buy a new pair of shoes to go to school, but unexpectedly he died again because of illness! The father's letter said that because there was no money at home, there was no way to invite a Western doctor, so he was treated by a Chinese doctor, and finally he could not be saved and died! Although the letter did not mention what kind of illness, but, undoubtedly, it was killed by a quack doctor! I loved my tenth younger brother, his kind of seemingly innocent and seemingly silly expression still makes me recall it. When I call out "Second Brother", his eyes are smiling and his mouth is blankly open. I really like him, I really love him, now he is dead, killed by a quack doctor, | my lovely brother yo! I love him, I want to see him again in my dreams!</p>
<p>Once the family goes bankrupt, the economy cannot be maintained, and younger siblings all die at the hands of quack doctors. When will there be that day: public hospitals are set up in every village. The people's diseases are treated by the public, and the people's health is protected by the public? There is only one country in the world now, and the lives of its people are guaranteed. When will we have that day in China?</p>
<p>Due to the death of siblings, dying at the hands of quack doctors, and dying in the absence of money to be healed, I can't help but look forward to the arrival of a perfect society!</p>

<p>— Mu Lu</p>
<p>Many people compare fate to the seasons, so who is spring for? Who is autumn for?</p>
<p>There is spring and autumn in the metropolis, there is the fragrant flesh of girls, and there are also the blood and tears of the poor...</p>
<p>It is said that people who are used to living in the city don't know much about the changing seasons. I don't know what that means? But I just think to myself: the young ladies' powder legs are less trembling on the street, maybe spring is gone, but I see the yellow water flowing straight down between the unshaven hairs of the rickshaw pullers, I gaze at the blue clouds in the sky for a while, and I wonder if it's spring or autumn now!</p>

<p>Although, there are tender green tung trees, beautiful flowers and plants, singing birds, and moonlight that doesn't cost money to buy in my hometown, but these days, the farmers are planting so hard that they are about to plant their lives! There's no way, I have to drag my wife and two children to the city!</p>
<p>When I came to the city, I saw the surging crowd like a tide, and there were very few people wearing blue coarse cloth. My wife bit my ear and said: (The women here have really old faces…) I also savored this trick, the women hanging on the men and running all over the street.</p>
<p>At night, the ghost fire flashes its eyes, and there are countless fire dragons, the two children jump up happily, and I also show a shallow smile on my bitter face, maybe I will walk into spring from now on?</p>
<p>The first time I did business, I followed Brother A-ba to pull a yellow-haired foreigner behind the car. When he didn't want to pay and wanted to leave, I wanted to reason with him, but I didn't know that he would slap me sideways, and then kick me. I looked at the Chinese people who were grinning at us, I looked at Brother A-ba who was holding back his tears, my heart was about to explode!</p>
<p>Now I stroked my hard beard, pinched my dry arms and legs, and thought of my dead wife and the two children who had been sold! I took the wrong path of this city's evil! Where is my spring?</p>
<p>Where is my spring? But I don't believe that God's spring is only for the rich!</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am incompetent and have shallow knowledge. Regarding the issue of a lifelong companion, I earnestly ask you to guide me in your spare time. I am now a student in school. My father insists on arranging a marriage for me with a woman who belongs to the old etiquette, but I already have someone in mind. She has received a higher elementary school education, and her love seems to be very dedicated on the surface, but she is too free and often restless at home, likes to do bamboo city plays, and has recently learned to dance. Because of this, I am very mentally distressed. I have given her loyal advice, but she does not change slightly because she loves me. As for the woman of the old etiquette, she is my neighbor, a person I have known since childhood is very honest, but unfortunately she is illiterate and has no common sense. However, she can fulfill her duties as a woman and has quite a bit of the three obediences and four virtues. However, a lifelong companion in life is a matter of a lifetime, and whether the marriage is happy or not is related to lifelong happiness. It is difficult to govern those with knowledge, and easy to govern those who are illiterate; but this matter is important, and I dare not determine which one can have a satisfactory ending. Therefore, I ask</p>
<p>Sir for guidance in a short period of time, I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Cheng Rong</p>
<p>Answer: If marriage is only seen as the satisfaction of sexual desire, and the union of men and women, then there is no problem, and it is possible to marry anyone. (But humans are not beasts and the harmony of flesh is not enough to satisfy their higher demands than desire. Here, there must be spiritual harmony and attraction between those who want to unite with him.) (Shabel, Women and Society) We should carefully consider whether the bodies and minds of both parties can be harmonized for those who unite. So the (lifelong companion) question you raised is indeed worthy of discussion, but I cannot agree with you taking (1) modern women and old-fashioned women, (2) education level, (3) which is easier to govern as the basis for selection. Your desire to govern women is completely speaking from the position of male dominance. This concept of women as tools should not exist at all now. Being influenced by new ideas and education level is only a condition that the interests of both men and women can be close to each other. Whether it can make each other's spirits harmonize still depends on the entire, subjective purpose and thought of both parties, and cannot be mechanically determined. Although you quite like that (lover), you also hate her liking (bamboo city plays) and (dancing). These are all things that make your spirits unable to harmonize. You only dislike that woman of the old etiquette for not having common sense and being illiterate, but you didn't say whether there is a conflict in your interests and thoughts. From my observation, you seem to be quite able to harmonize with her spiritually, because you are not a non-old etiquette man! The reason is not because you oppose your lover dancing and playing mahjong, no one can agree with her kind of low-level love for enjoyment. You judge who is a lifelong companion with the psychology of governing women, which is completely naked and you are full of old etiquette. I think you should still marry the woman of the old etiquette. Perhaps you can be close in thought and life, but this is because you are easy to govern her. It is absolutely impossible to tolerate male dominance over women.</p>

<p>— Xi Jun</p>
<p>Counting, counting, almost four or five songs have passed. The tall man in the black robe always has such a lonely face; one hand supports his chin, the other hand holds a cigarette, his eyes are quietly staring at the floor, without moving. Smoking, showing the smoke rings exhaled from his mouth, the dark coffee squats on the table, after smoking, he drinks coffee, after drinking coffee, he smokes again, always sitting there silently, his lips are like sealed, he doesn't say a word, he doesn't laugh either. It's been the time of four or five songs! Every song has someone dancing with her, and Tian Ren stood in front of her for a while with a smiling face. But how she responded, she always looked at you with two calm eyes, without any expression, and then threw down the cigarette in her hand, slowly propped herself up, shook the hem of her clothes halfway down, and then, as if unwilling, let you hug her and danced away.</p>
<p>(How can a lively person have such a melancholy look?) I asked myself in my heart.</p>
<p>Watching her not talking to the man, Carl also aroused curious attention, because such a person is really not easy to see!</p>
<p>(Wherever she dances, four pairs of eyes chase her.)</p>
<p>Carl watched and sighed:</p>
<p>| This kind of sorrow must not be sorrow for life, look at her never missing a piece of music. | She's another tired person in life!</p>
<p>| That's right, under the grindstone of life, it will often make such a lively person become melancholy.</p>
<p>| Like us together.</p>
<p>| The young man's frustrated mood!</p>
<p>| The young man's frustrated mood!</p>
<p>They both sighed deeply.</p>
<p>I will also be melancholic for her melancholy for no reason! Dazed, under the dark red lights, through a layer of heavy fog, I glanced at the tall man in the black robe dancing across there; still those calm eyes, and also pretty eyes, even more dazzling, and closed clam-like little red lips...</p>
<p>(The young man's terrible frustrated mood!)</p>
<p>I read heavily in my heart again.</p>
