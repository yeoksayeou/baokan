<p>自犬養被剌齋藤登台以後日本議會政治即顯現其頽廢狀態而軍部勢力則突飛猛進而不可遏止惟自「九一八」事變發生以還日本國内之經濟恐慌日益尖銳而農村問題尤形嚴理一般政客乃認爲攻撃軍部之良機以圖維持其生命故先則暴露所謂軍紀問題予陸軍閥以難堪再則舉發文相納賄事件作倒閣之先聲</p>
<p>此次政友會議員岡本一己氏所舉發文相鳩山氏之納賄事件其證據已載明於檢事局記錄决非無端造謠中傷者可比乃令人回想日本教育界窮困之事實執教人員欠薪不發生計艱難故種種誘惑遂得乘隙而進教育界收受賄賂之醜行自小學以至於最高學府如長崎醫大者早經傳遍於全國今且以最高教育行政首長同流合污聞所謂綱紀問題之反映誠堪注目且也日本自隴川教授事件發生後研究學術之自由已成紙上空談然其反響所及不惟社會普通階級之教員學生甘受惡化傳染即身受貴族教育之學習院子弟亦不免於左傾由此推知日本之全社會實充滿腐化惡化勢力因鳩山納賄而引起之綱紀問題特其一端而已</p>
<p>然因議員舉發而引起綱紀問題之軒然大波是否即爲議會政治重見光明之朕兆則仍不能無疑蓋日本各大政黨皆憑特財閥之背景政友會之依附三井財閥民政黨之依附三菱財閥久爲公開之秘密而南滿鐵道爲在朝黨之財力策源地亦屬家喻户曉勿容深諱因此而引起民間之反感遭遇軍部之攻撃固其自取之各九一八事變既起軍部之　頇政策遂乘勢而代興矣日本議會政治之缺憾既已完全暴露而軍人政治之短處亦不可彌補軟弱無力之齋藤内閣乃得因軍閥與政黨之互相牽制而維持其所謂超然内閣之生命一方面以渡過非常時期導入憲政常軌自許一方面仍不免於軍部勢力之支配以常理而論現内閣以一超政黨之混合内閣而依違於兩大之間以執行所謂非常時之政務誠非易易而爲軍部方面計亦不過借之以敷衍憲政之門面而圖軍部政策之繼續推進耳</p>
<p>現在綱紀問題既已暴發内閣前途危機重重方在稱病中之齋藤氏能否繼續執政頗堪疑問然即令齋藤内閣崩潰而鈴木若槻亦少單獨組閣之可能蓋議會既不易控制軍部關係尤難於圆滿則所謂憲政常道之恢復恐終成幻想而已今後無論字垣一成近衞文磨或山本高橋諸人拜受組閣之大命皆不免於標榜舉國一致之美名而仰海陸軍部之鼻息殆可斷言也</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　溥儀改稱「滿洲國」皇帝登位之日僅有八天、此間政府人員及全國新聞界對於承認「滿洲國」問題、日内又頗爲注意、羅斯福總統今日在接見記者時曾聲明此事頗爲複雜、渠不願有所主張、須俟與國務卿磋商後、再行發表、近有人主張美國已與俄國携手、應即承認「滿洲國」、則美國在「滿洲國」貿易可以增加、但一般人則懷疑美國若承認「滿洲國、」則美國在中國貿易必大受打撃、紐約每日新聞竟極力從事宣傳、謂承認「滿洲國」足以發展美國之商業、惟據華盛頓重要人員言、彼等均不信有承認「滿洲國」之可能、且溥儀登位事、亦與美國毫不相關云、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　據可靠方面消息、日本似有意以美國承認「滿洲國」爲日本参加一九三五年海軍會議之先决條件、但截至目下止、日本尚未提出此項要求、因「滿洲國」現在尚不能保護美僑、使不受盜匪之侵害、如美國予以承認、反足使「滿洲國」處於困難地位、惟美國人士對日本之意向、頗爲關心、一俟倫敦海軍條約有效期限將滿之時、則美國究决定嚴格遵守前國務卿史汀生所宣布之不承認「滿洲國」原則乎、抑將在太平洋上、再行從事軍備競爭乎、美國對於此二者、究將何所棄取、屆時或不免有所游移、外傳歐洲方面有某某國家、旦夕間將承認「滿洲國」、外交界人士以爲此種舉動、德國可能、因德國承認之後、則雙方在經濟上均有利益、滿洲輸出大豆、年達三百萬噸、其中運往德國者、即佔一百萬噸、上年德國對大豆征進口稅甚重、滿洲大豆極受影響、其存貨已達二百萬噸、德國如承認「滿洲國」、則必與之簽訂商約、以後「滿洲國」對德輸出大豆、而以所得之價、購買德國之貨物、雙方均受其益云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　此間人士風聞歐洲某某國、旦夕間即將承認「滿洲國」、亟欲明瞭此種情事如果發生時、美國將採取如何態度、由白宫本日傳出之消息觀之、美國對於如此釀成之時局、自當加以考慮、但前國務卿史汀生所宣布之主義、即不承認用暴力或用侵略手段所造創之國家一層、未必遽作機械式之實行云、（按一九三二年一月七日、美國曾向中日兩國提出照會、謂美國對於日本佔據滿洲、不能認爲合法、而在佔據後所樹立之制度、因其違反門户開放主義、并違反九國條約、亦不能予以承認、是年二月二十四日、史汀生在其致参議員波拉之公函中、復堅持中國門户開放政策、并認華府九國條約有維持之必要）（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>並請財部暫緩批准白銀恊定</p>
<p>因美提高銀價對我毫無裨益</p>
<p>美政府邇爲提高白銀價格起見、將重行鼓鑄銀幣、並已提出参院討論、此項消息傳出後、我國銀行界以此舉一旦實行、我國爲一入超國家、且爲銀本位國、必將備受不堪設想之影響、因此特於本月二十日、以上海市銀行同業公會名義、代表全滬銀行、致電美總統羅斯福、表示意見、同時並電財部、暫緩批准世界經濟會議中所産生之白銀恊定、以資應付國外貨幣侵略、惟銀行界中、以兹事體大、對外尚嚴守秘密、兹經華東社記者詳細調查、特將詳情、分誌如下、</p>

<p>本市銀行界各要人、以美政府提高銀價、其結果必將使我國白銀、大批流出、經密切交換意見之結果、於本月二十日、以上海市銀行業同業公會名義、代表全滬各銀行、致電美總統羅斯福、請加以愼重考慮、原文係建議性質、並非抗議、措辭中對美政府此項政策、固未能明白反對、但實際上、則聲明中國銀行界、對於此舉、認爲一旦施行、表示萬分遺憾也、又據申時社記者向有關係方面探悉、該電内容、大致爲（一）說明中國現狀及經濟情形、（二）根據中國目前經濟情形、對於美方白銀政策之實行、中國金融商界將受嚴重之損失、（三）美驟然高度提高銀價結果、將引起中國國際匯兌上不可收拾之混亂、（四）盼美政府實行白銀政策、盼能逐步提高銀價、勿取突然漲高方法、以减少中國银市之紊亂、以上各點、盼美方加以注意、該電發出後、據本市銀行界方面所得消息、謂羅氏已允加以考慮、蓋彼目前尚不能即表示可否也、</p>

<p>銀行界方面、復於同日、致電南京財政部長孔祥熙氏、請暫緩批准世界經濟會議中所産生之白銀協定、蓋以值此美政府當局、積極設法提高白銀價格之際、觀其舉動、勢在必行、銀行界雖已致電美總統陳說一切、但恐收效殊微、而此際白銀協定、正在咨送各國政府批准中、我國政府、一旦貿然批准、則對於此後白銀問題、勢將受此拘束、不能自由伸縮運用、故特請求財部、在此美政府提高銀價政策、尚未完全明瞭之前、此項協定、暫緩予以批准、</p>

<p>我國銀行界表示、銀界高漲、因物價之高漲而自然形成、則此種趨勢、於社會及國際間尚無影響、今觀美國提高白銀政策、祗唯銀價提高之是騖、此種膨漲政策、其對華傾銷、確屬有利、但我國貨品、將受此影響、不能運銷國外、此種形勢、將使我國所有現銀、全部流出、國内所存者、祗有貨物而已、其結果必陷我國之經濟狀况於不能周轉而極度混亂、苟我國而爲一出超國家、則銀價之高漲、於我尚無影響、今則不然、連年外貨傾銷、愈趨愈烈、即就昨日國際貿易局所發表者、本年一月份中、入超之數、已達四千餘萬、就此種統計觀之、益知銀價之提高、於吾有百害而無一利也、</p>

<h3 id="c133">川河輪同盟漲費 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>引起川帮停辦商貨</p>
<p>增漲百分之一百</p>
<p>各報關行多爭議</p>
<p>川河各江輪、同盟合作、增漲水脚、已誌本報、連日輪公司爲雜貨運輸之尺碼斤量等問題、尚在會議中、而川帮客家、對於此次漲價、固未可反對、惟於改革重量等、頗有異議、昨日各客家已發電至重慶、請停止辦貨、以爲抵禦、記者再將各方面所得情形、分述如下、</p>
<h3 id="c134">新率實行 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>太古怡和民生捷江等所議定川河輪同盟合作、並增漲水脚以後、自昨日起、各輪公司已通知各報關行、及各客家實行新水脚、上海棉紗運往重慶、每件由十二元漲至二十二元、即由民生之民亨輪、捷江之共平輪裝運出口貨爲始、該二輪即在今明兩日、自滬赴川、實爲川河輪同盟合作與漲費後之第一次上水船也、</p>
<h3 id="c135">二次漲價 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>此次各輪公司、在捷江會議時、原議川河水脚、自改兩爲元後、即使漲足棉紗二十二元、亦不過十五兩有奇、在此航業界各項消费狂增之時、猶不能獲利、故各公司代表公開討論結果、須將川河運動、一律增漲百分之一百、棉紗十二元者加至二十四元、其他如疋頭雜貨香烟各項、亦照原定水脚、加漲一倍、惟已經宣布者爲棉紗等十元一件、餘俟三月一日起、再行加漲、按百分之一百新價收費、</p>
<h3 id="c136">繼續討論 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>關於漲價之貨物甚多、有以尺碼計算者、有以重量計算者、此次各輪公司公議、對於各貨裝運、除依照新定運費繳納外、其尺碼重量、須連袋皮箱子等統算水脚、不得再有以前之所謂毛斤凈斤等折扣、其占面積者亦照此計數、故昨日下午、各輪公司代表又在太古公司内召集會議、討論此項問題、</p>
<h3 id="c137">客家爭持 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>川帮各報關行、對於新議運貨之尺嗎重量、與輪公司方面頗有爭執、其理由則謂貨件納費之毛凈計算尺量、凡屬長江内華商輪公司、歷來均照此辦理、今一旦改易新章、使裝貨者殊多損失、而公司方面、則以照外洋船定例、本無毛凈計費之法、今次之改變水脚、要亦非川河各輪局所特創者、於此問題、雙方頗多爭議、迄未解决也、</p>
<h3 id="c138">停辦貨件 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>滬上川帮各客家、以今兹各輪公司議漲之水脚、過於巨大、照原定之運率、統加一倍、且於尺嗎斤量、又如此認眞、各客帮已會議多次、僉以川中存貨尚多、即使目前止運、於川省市面、亦無若何影響、而轉可將貨價略於提高、昨日川帮已公同議定、聯名電達重慶、報告滬上各輪公司漲費之狀况、並請即日即日起停止辦貨、以爲對付川河各輪公司之唯一辦法、該電昨已發出、此後川河輪去貨、將大爲减色云、</p>

<p>激成全體房客公憤</p>
<p>組房聯會聯合對付</p>
<p>國民社云、前五省聯軍總司令孫傳芳在滬時、所置産業甚多、自下野後、恐有不便、故托由本埠義品銀行辦理結束、先將馬浪路西成里二百餘幢房屋收回經租權、但自收回後、查悉該里房客有積欠房租至二三月者、經租處事前既不予通知、即行呈訴法院、予以查封、有十三家之多、當時有多數房客、僅有婦孺在家、聞悉封門消息、驚惶異常、一再哀懇、經租賬房堅執不允、致激成西成里二百餘户房客公憤、遂組織房客聯合會、聘請吳凱聲律師提起反訴、昨日、該里其他一部份房客、又接業主警告、將予第二次發封、各房客甚爲憤激、除遵照大會議决案執行外、並擬對孫傳芳如此苛刻行爲、發表宣言、請社會援助云、</p>

<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>看新教育家們的理論，大抵是不主張對小學生用笞刑的，但在實際上，不知道現在的小學生還在被教員打手心否？要是已經不了，那麽他們實在幸福，令我們早讀十書的人羡慕不已。</p>
<p>十年前的小學生還是没有一個不吃手心的，而且教員無論打得怎樣兇，家長和旁人决不說一句話。我們那里有一首歌謠說：</p>
<p>「爹娘打，應該打；先生打，買以（他）打；别人打，投保長（即保正。）」</p>
<p>原來教員的打學生；是學生出了錢買他打的。爲什麽要買他打呢？大概是因爲自來讀書都爲做官，做官可以打人，若書讀不好則不得官做，不做官即不得打人矣。但要把書讀好，非請先生督責不可，督責之嚴者就是打。被先生打了，將來做了官可以從百姓身上多多打還，這正和賺利息之要先出本錢一樣。</p>
<p>所以，向來的中國人，誰都不免被父母所打，讀書的則被先生所打，不讀書的則或被官廳打，或被工頭所打，或被地主所打……</p>
<p>我們可以說，不曾被打過的，不能算是中國人。</p>
<p>我近日在西班牙文豪伊本納兹（Blasoo　Ibarnez）的「中國游記」中，看到如下的一節：</p>
<p>「在五千年間，那堅硬的竹板，是中匣的眞正的權威者。那魔術的板子，强迫人們服從道德法律，而運轉國家的機輪。中國人中，唯一的不會挨打的人，中是天子。此外，即使是尊貴的大員或親信的寵臣，在皇帝的命令之下，也不免挨一二十下的板子，以贖他們的過失。挨打之後，等皇帝表示同情他們的時候，他們仍可恢復舊職。一個中國人，從兒時開始，已被父母打慣了，所以一生中被人打幾次，誰也不以爲恥。他們犯了過失，只要挨一頓打，飯碗就不全敲破，權勢也不至减少。他們看挨打，不過如我們看被市政府罰　那麽輕淡。中國的警察，手裏老是拿着竹棒或皮鞭，一看到百姓犯罪，立刻便打過去。」</p>
<p>外國人談論中國的别緻的地方，常常過甚其辭。這一節，粗粗看來，似乎也有點誇張，但其實是眞情，即在今日，打人與挨打的情形，還不是如此。担打人不一定用竹板，巴掌，拳頭，皮鞋，槍托，鞋底，烟管……無所不可，其盛况可想矣！</p>
<h3 id="c221">中國人的幽默 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>我曾說過中國民族是不適宜於幽默的民族，因爲一切所謂文學，歷代幾乎都是把持在士大夫階級的手裏，而士大夫階級的氣味是最反幽默的。間或在平民的文學裏，我們可以看到類似幽默之類的東西，但那與其稱爲幽默不如稱爲詼諧更爲適當，因爲在這種該諧裏是包藏着一種下流氣，比起我們普通稱爲幽默的智慧的隠喻，是不可同日語的；反之，這種詼諧倒是與一般雜要塲中的相聲那種下流的貧嘴是極爲接近，也許現今流行的相聲就是從平民文學中的詼諧發展起來的吧。</p>
<p>在平民文學裏，這種詼諧爲了維持讀者的與趣時常是非常不適當地硬插進來的。嚴格地講當是有害於藝術的完整，不過當我們明白了作者的用意時，也就不甚刻救，而不妨隨着作者笑一笑，至於那些普通的讀者，若讀到像這種地方時，他們是會哈哈折笑的。</p>
<p>在「三俠五義」這類書中，這種例子也頗不少；爲明白中國的詼諧倒底是怎樣的東西，我們舉出一兩個例來看吧。在第三十五回書中，寫到馮君衡瞧了他的表妹一眼，於是作者就詼諧地解釋起來了：</p>
<p>「他道一瞧直不是人，是人丨丨没有那們瞧的。往往書上多有「眉眼傳情」，又云「眉來眼去」。仔細想來，這個眉毛竟無用處，眼睛爲的是瞧；眉毛跟在裏頭。可攪什麽呢？不是這麽說嗎？要是没有他，眞磕碜。就猶如笑話上說的丨丨嘴合鼻說：「咍，老鼻呀！你有什麽本事，竟敢居在我的上頭呢？」鼻子徐道：「你若不虧我聞見，你如何分的出香臭來呢？」鼻子又合眼睛說話：「治，老眼哪！你有什麽本事，竟敢居在我的上頭呢？」眼睛答道：「佝若不虧我瞧見，你如何知道好歹呢？」眼睛又合眉毛說話：「咍，老眉呀！你有什麽本事，竟敢居在我的上頭呢？」眉毛答道：「我原没有什麽本事，不過是你的配搭兒。你若不願意我在你上頭，就挪在你的底下去。看你得樣兒不得樣兒。丨丨馮君衝他這一瞧，眞是把眉毛錯安了位了。」</p>
<p>這像一切的下流的貧嘴一樣是變相的駡音；同時也像一切下流的貧嘴一樣，這駡音若細加琢磨，是並不十分適當的。從這種詼諧中可以看出平民文學中的士大夫氣，因爲駡人已經駡得巧妙了，而這種士大夫氣，就是一般無教育的平民也很容易接受，或者換一句話說，很容易受到傳染。所以說中國社會上流行的相聲的玩意兒，最初是平民從士大夫學得來的，大概没有什麽錯誤；不過一到平民的嘴裏，就越來越下流，結果成了十足的下流的貧嘴。</p>
<p>像從這樣的詼諧裏我們可以看出一個原則，娵用詼諧來掩飾了駡音，成了我們所謂的一挖苦一或刻薄，這笑也不是好笑。但有時雖同樣還是不脫刻薄氣，而不是作者故意編排出來，只藉着風俗人情的描繪，作成的詼諧的例，也是有的。這在「續小五養」的第九十三回中，寫窮爺爺打擂的一段，最爲描寫得活現。原文雖較長，但爲想說明中國人的幽默的樣式，是必要引過來的。</p>
<p>一單說這窮人困苦到這般光景，還有什麽心腸打擂？皆因教大家督催，實出無奈。……他替馬龍着急，心内想着一比勢，他身後有一個人，就教他肘了一個觔斗。那人扒將起來，搗着前胸，「噯呀，噯呀」的哼哼說：「朋友！你看天到這個時候，也該找找去了。你瞧我們這些人，看完了打擂，回到家中全都有凉飯。似乎尊駕，你得現去找去；若要過了時刻，誰能與你預備那麽現現成成的，我說的是好話。」</p>
<p>「把這位爺說得氣往上一衝，說：你管我去找不去找，與你何干？」那人說：「我本就是勞病，你冲着我心口給了我一肘：你不管我受得受不得！你看，　熱鬧的人甚多，誰象你帶比架勢的？眞有本事，上去與這位台官較量較量；眞能把這個台官像我似的踢他個觔斗，就是一千兩；打他一拳，也鬧五十兩，換換衣裳；這是何苦哪！」窮人說：「我不愛換衣裳，你管不了俺的閒事！」那人說：「我是管不了。别的話没有，我上你前頭站着去。」</p>
<p>「可巧窮人又看見馬爺打出去一拳不到家，自已又一比勢，說：「要是這樣，可就打着台官了。」砰的一聲，又打在那個人的後心上。那人噯呀一聲，往前一栽，要不是人多，幾乎也就栽倒了。</p>
<p>「那人回頭惡很很的說：「窮鬼！你窮瘋了罷！我前後没躱過你去。既有這個能耐，何不上去露露臉去？就會欺服我呀！」窮人說：「我是替那個朋友用力。」那人說：「你再替那人用力，我就死了！你是好朋友，上去！」窮人說：「我上去就上去！可惜我如今衣衫襤褸丨」那人說：「不在衣衫；眞有本領，人家給你換衣服。就怕你不敢上去。」窮人說：「被你說得我倒只得上去了。」那人說·「很好！」窮人看了看自己的衣服………還是不肯上去。</p>
<p>「那個被傷的。本是個壞人：暗暗約會了十數個人，把窮人往起一擠，大家一着乎，齊聲一喊，說：「窮爺爺到了！」就把那個窮人擠上台去。……」</p>
<p>在這里似乎没有作者自身的刻薄，而是寫到下流貧嘴的人，文章成了詼諧。若比起前例，是稍稍有些差别，然而也是大同小異吧。</p>
<p>中國人的這種詼諧，在現在的文學上也遲延續着，只是換了一個名稱，呌做幽默了。不過幽默總說離不開下流貧嘴，其前途是頗爲危險的。</p>
<h3 id="c222">「出行」 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 魏猛克</p>
<p>從畢剥畢剥聲裏睡去，又從畢剥畢剥聲裏醒來，覺得半邊臉發熱，知道太陽也趕起來了。今天是元旦。</p>
<p>打開朝東的窗，一陣風送進火藥香，使人頭痛。眼前是一片蔚藍的海，天氣好呀！</p>
<p>打扮了一頓，携一隻手提照相機，要趁早「出行」了。</p>
<p>「殺！……」，剛出門，耳朶邊就來了一陣鵲噪似的尖呌。一羣小孩子，忽然都渾身新裝束，戴紅鬍鬚，拿着漆得雪亮的木刀槍，雄赳赳的，在衖堂口演習衝鋒戰。</p>
<p>馬路上倒也靜寂，舖店的門板關得鐵緊，那上面的紅對聯妙語固多，「對我生財」的紅紙條却家家一律。空隆空隆的糞車是全部肅清了。只有昨夜出現的「音樂隊」仍然敲着大鑼大鼓，一班又一班，往還地巡游着。丨這些英雄們，雖然一整夜未睡，但看那共同的一副嬉皮笑臉，刧證明是依然精神抖撤。</p>
<p>走着，那兒去呢，不管他。然而又遇着許多新的英雄了。丨丨這扮演者，大半是頭戴小瓜皮，腰圍長絲帶，平日在街頭巷口，　排難解紛的那等脚色。他們的衣袋裏，滿滿的塞着「金錢砲」，囁着脚，似乎在偵探誰，倘若遇着了一位小姐，就以爲是一個大發現，趕忙追上去，手望地下一擲，拍的一聲，大家哈哈大笑了。聽說上海的小姐們，元旦是不帶叭兒狗出來散步的，那委實也有理由。</p>
<p>走着。眼前佈滿了鐵絲網，這一時很使我心驚，但即刻就意識到要到「中國地界」了，這兒的鐵絲網是佈在一條小河上的，這就是上海的所謂什麽浜吧。這浜雖然榨狹，然而也擁擠着幾十隻大小的草船。黄金色的稻草成疊的堆砌在船杯上，遠着儼然無數座土山。從船與船之間的空隙裏，隠約可看見紫竭色的污泥吻着船腹。丨冬天水涸了，鄉農們也居然有機會在這繁華的上海過新年呢！船頭大都插着三枝線香和一對紅臘燭，也有燃放幾掛鞭砲的，這自然是求神保佑，趕快賣完那些稻草，在春潮漲時，好裝一船肥料回去。他們一年來用血汗換來的，不都在這裏麽！女人在船尾做飯，炊烟四熳。孩子們在草堆裏打滾，胡鬧地嬉笑着，雖然他們都没有新衣穿，但也總是吉歡的，是新年呵：</p>
<p>穿出鐵門，跨過弓形的石橋，也依然還是馬路，但是，已經没有了摩天的大厦，己經看得見乾　了的樹木，枯黄了的野草，和荒廢了的田園，而且，還有那稀爛的，尸臭衝天的棺材，横七豎八地丢在泥土上，這大概。有利於農作的，雖然或於衞住……？不，這是鄉下了。</p>
<p>據說久蟄居於都市的人，偶然涉足鄉村是要覺得一切都可愛的，可惜我的身後纒着無數的乞丐，無法暢遊。</p>
<p>轉來時，太陽當頂了，微風送來嘟嘟嘟的聲音，是工廠農放工的氣笛，該是雖在新年，也還要工作的人們休息的時候了吧，然而乞丐們仍然顺着氣，在我身後緊緊的追趕，並且一路上還這樣的慶賀道：「老爺，恭喜新年發財呀！」</p>

<p>— 殊</p>
<p>（十）（八）</p>
<p>尤西堂（侗）的「雜俎」，在筆記小說中是一部傑作，西堂在文尣史裏，當然也是一個名家。不過，人第知其爲名家，而不知他曾經是個闊綽的窮措大。我曾經直到他的一通與友人書，其言曰：「歲行盡矣，風雨凄然！紙窗竹尾，燈火青　，吾不知佳趣竟安在哉。雁裘質矣，何有孤貂？魚釜空矣，何有羊羔？昔人詩云：風力欲冰酒，霜威能折綿，今也無酒可冰，無綿可拆，悲哉悲哉，何以卒歲？」吾人在「何以卒歲」的感歎中讀此，眞有些「實獲我心」，所愉雖苦，苦中有趣，因附誌於趣喻之末。</p>
<p>（十）（九）</p>
<p>右「趣喻」十七則，讀周亮工「賴古堂尺牘所鈔」十二卷，二鈔「藏棄集」十六卷，三鈔「結鄰集」十六卷時所寫之「讀書扎記」也。所以拿出發表，不過是要在此苦悶年頭，聊博讀者一笑而已！近來文路之窄，匪言可喻，既未生西崽文學家之骨骼，又不能以清風明月充我飢腸，不得已尋此苦趣，眞有啼笑皆非之感。今之達人雅士，其諒我也。一九三三年二月十日跋。</p>

<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>圍着馬塲的竹籠外面，隆着滇缅通商的灰色大道，蜿蜒地從羣山裏面伸了下來，又蛇也似地爬了上去。路邊蔓延着的含羞草上，流着三兩點暗綠的螢火，用電光觸去，牠們便没入草間了。</p>
<p>電光射入坡上黑鬱鬱的叢林，校頭夜宿的小鳥，便慌慌張張地呌了起來，抖着眉峯一樣的翅子，紛紛散入月明的空際。一會見，便重歸靜寂了。四周藍色的山層，靜悠悠地熟睡着，月光的素足，在牠們的身上踐踏過去，也没有絲毫覺着的樣子。</p>
<p>只有峽裏田中國奔來的檳榔江，還在深夜裏獨自兒雄肚地歌着，彷彿逃出故鄉，遠來異國，正是非常快活地，高興地。</p>
<p>竹壁縫裏透出了老劉家的燈光，我們這兩個尋覓美麗女子的夜遊人，便掀開竹笆子門，走了進去。油燈下面做着鞋子的野人婆，黑布高包頭和大耳環的陰影，正粗大地畫在竹壁上面。抬起頭來怔了一怔，等我招呼之後，才微笑地用漢人話問：</p>
<p>「做什麽呀！」</p>
<p>一面打量着站在我側邊的外國人，就稍稍流出了驚訝的神情。</p>
<p>「他要查一查這屋裏人，有没有爲非作歹的。」</p>
<p>我忍住了笑，故意打起很漂亮的官腔，嚇嚇這位平日　蠻的女人，同時也想遮掩着這件丢臉的事情，使人家不會知道起來。</p>
<p>「嚇嚇嚇………」</p>
<p>「通帶着怪樣的笑聲，響在後面。回頭看，不知幾時老劉就已經站在我們背後了。他向我吊下嘴角含意地一笑，彷彿在輕蔑地說丨丨可尊敬的年青人哪！怎麽你也做起「牽馬」的事來？一面怪不高興地說道：</p>
<p>「這一晚！一個　夷女人也没有來哪！」</p>
<p>不用說，他又像我的老板一樣，預先性得了，跟着很生氣地說：</p>
<p>「你們店裏不很多嗎？」</p>
<p>看着這樣的笑容，廳着這樣的冷語，頓時把我氣惱壞了。簡直是靈魂上重重地着了一鞭似的。</p>
<p>「干我屁事，人家是來檢查的哪！」</p>
<p>紅漲着臉，勉强這麽抵了一句，乎電筒塞給外國人，便氣狠狠地獨自抽身走了。</p>
<p>到了店裏，向印度人交代之後，就去睡覺，一面脫衣，一面突然想着：</p>
<p>「這不對哪！」</p>

<p>程天放訓詞　略謂、陳主席因有要公赴贛、由鄙人來與諸位略談幾句、教育之根基、建築在小學身上、小學辦得好、則中學纔辦得好、中學好然後大學纔好、鄙人對現在的小學教育有幾點感想（一）小學教育本爲强迫教育、但現在中國并不如此、反有學校少學童多之患、（二）師資不够、這是各地普遍的現象、所以我們想設法將鄉村師範逐漸增加、（三）教育事業與生産事業脫離關係、往往學子在未受教育之前、尚能生産及至受了教育之後、再變成分産份子、巴不屑在農村工作、這一點在中國教育前途上是稂嚴重而值得注意的、江蘇的教費、雖然拮据、然較之他省、已屬、富裕、我們固望教費的增加、但切不可再取之於田賦、現在農村已將破産、我們應該要邦助他、維持他、還能加重他們的負擔嗎、</p>
<p>周佛海訓詞　略謂今天開這次地方教育視導會議、是江蘇從未舉行過的、不但江蘇就是全國也没有舉行過、所以這次會議、有没有結果、有没有成績、關係教育前途頗大、希望諾位要特别注意、這次會議重要的問題、就是縣督學互換視導、共要點、（一）可以將地方上挾仇報復徇情等弊端取銷、（二）可以使督學精神緊張、（三）可使被視察者工作緊張、（四）提高縣督學地位、擴大職權加重責任、縣督學應注意之要點、（一）鄉村教材、（二）音樂教材、（三）體育教材、均須要有發揚民族精神的教材、最後希望諸視察要認眞要公平、不要敷衍塞責、</p>

<p>記者昨晤新自南洋歸國之黄秉坤君於旅邸、黄君在南洋各屬　僑學校担任教職、凡十餘年之久、此次携眷告老歸國、對南洋華僑教育情况、頗爲明瞭、兹將黄君所告、詳誌如次、黄君稱、南洋華人甚多、尤以粤閩兩地人士爲最、各屢除外國政府廣設學校、收容華僑、以期殖民化外、華人之熱心教育自設學校者亦多、尤以英屬荷屬華僑學校林立、新加坡一埠已有二百餘所、所有</p>
<p>學校行政　除暹羅華僑學校受該獨立國教育機之牽制外、其他如英荷法各屬華僑學校俱係獨立、其行政最高機關爲董事部、校址大多設在同鄉會内、廣東如廣肇·潮州·容屬·海南等同鄉會、福建如漳州·同安·安溪等同鄉會、其建築校舍者爲數殊少、學校董事大半商人、對教育既不明瞭、復忙於商務、無暇顧及、故徒負虚名、有時以權限不明、發生衝突、干涉教務等情、政校務時受影響、祖國政府雖曾令南洋各領事館兼管</p>
<p>華僑教育　但各領事均視爲具文、其次華僑學校時受居劉政府干涉、如英政府頒布華校註册條例、設華人視學、暹羅政府干涉更嚴、凡華人當校長教員者須受暹政府考試、不懂暹文者不許充任、故各校功課對於暹文每週多至二十餘小時、至各校經費以前較爲充足、近年來受世界經濟恐慌之影響、南洋商業頗不景氣、經費亦漸感困難、且各校對經費支配並無標凖、預算亦至紊亂、實爲國内學校所未見、</p>
<p>各校教員　其自國内介紹者頗少、大半發徵求廣告、自行應聘且重視文憑、對經騐及學識不問、以國音及書法最爲重視、如能說流利之平話、學生頗遵之、課程並無一定標凖、普通以歌舞英文較注重、英文教員暹人爲多、中文教員俱担任一級、無論圖書唱歌均須教授、而待遇亦漸苛刻、</p>
<p>華僑學生　頗有愛國思想、對祖國時事之講解、樂聽不倦、惟以生長熱帶、血氣方剛、教室内時起打架、日嗜賭博、好吃零食、學生就讀學校、並不固定、其原因以家屬大半營商、時貧時富、忽東忽西、有流動性、故校中登記學生、每週有之、是爲辦理最感困難者、總之華僑教育現雖極紊亂狀態、希政府當局派員視察、從事改善云、</p>

<h3 id="c258">有剌的玫瑰 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>夫婦的生活，最忌的是水平形的，因爲水平形的夫婦生活，雖然表面上是很和諧，鄰店都不聞詬誶之聲，可是生活的興趣、絶對够不上波浪形的有味。所以某學者不是吾友　從前曾提倡過「夫婦該時常爭吵，甚至打架」的學說。他的主張是夫婦該時常爲了一件不必爭執的小事情而爭執，還該由爭執而吵嘴，山吵嘴而動武，由動武而互相在對乎方的胳膞上咬下一塊肉來。夫婦經了這麽一次大鬧之後，而再言歸於好，那時的生活興趣，凖比没鬧以前，有味得多。之後，隔了若干時期，夫婦愛情，日漸淡　了，那麽，得再找機會，玩一下子。這便是所謂波形的夫婦生活，是使夫婦愛情，常保青春的惟一良法。</p>
<p>因爲波形的夫婦生活的原理，我就聞一知十的領悟了有剌的玫瑰，爲甚麽受人擁護的原理。人們的生活，自然也是太單調而無聊了。有錢人在大腿裏打滾，在酒杯裏打滾，在錢眼裏打滾。打滾得煩膩了，嚷一回到農村去，或是獨個兒在馬路上散一回步，或是過一二天平民生活，都會覺得是怪受用的。反之，如窮小子，在疾病裏打滾，在生活裏打滾，在一切時代的恐怖裏打滾，打滾得喘不過氣來時，一樣的會得暫時忘掉了一切痛苦，而去追求片刻的享樂，以調劑精神。所以礦工在幽暗，陰惨的地下層工作時，也會得噓唇作曲，碼頭小工站在足以毁滅自己生命而有餘的起重機下，還得對滿身曲線的女客瞥一眼，冥想着一切，而神秘地微笑着。所以一般人，並不因玫瑰有剌，怕被剌而就不愛玫瑰了。</p>
<p>這個社會上的人，正需求着多量的有剌的玫瑰，正需要着一切波形的生活，丨丨自然，不只是夫婦生活，否則，誰都要感到單調，寂寞，而益發要咒詛人生的空虚了。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>邢蓬萊將軍吳子玉氏，近來隠居幽燕，匿跡銷聲，人們已忘懷了他當年十萬貔貅，長城飲馬的氣概了。可是他老人家也厭談兵事，終日以盡竹寫梅爲唯一消遣，什麽自起開窗畫竹枝咧，大風壓竹拜梅花咧，牙人深致，求諸今日武夫中，確是不可多得的。</p>
<p>臘盡春回，景俗沿舊，張燈掛綵，點綴新年。吳氏忽發清興，特在廊房頭條的燈畫舖裏，定製了各式燈盞三百多個，燈盞都以細纱糊成。吳氏生平崇拜關羽岳飛爲人，特倩了畫家，在燈紗上繪着三國志和岳傳等故事。加以綵色，益見燦爛。那關岳更畫的神氣活現，自有一種儒將風度。一到晚間，諸燈燃燭，照彼元夜，炳若朝陽。吳氏邀了許多舊時僚屬，設宴觀賞其間。燈光掩映，人面俱紅。吳氏不覺低吟前人的詩：火樹當筵出，燈屏繞席斜，爲之連浮三白。僚屬知道主人興致飈舉，便飛箋招了若干名歌女來，唱了幾支曲兒。那粉白黛綠，玉笑珠顰，在燈光的下面，越顯得娉婷多姿，容態姣好。吳氏雖屬魯男柳惠，平日不解好色，可是到了此際，也不禁有氣短情長之概。聽了抑揚緜妙的吳謳，大加贊賞，說：莫怪世人有生在蘇州，住在杭州的諺語，深憾没福爲蘇杭之游，一覩湖山秀色哩。說時，一觥連一觥的飲着，宴罷客散，吳氏已酩酊不能成步，由左右扶掖入寢。明日賦詩紀事，徧索僚屬的和章。聞頗多佳什，惜鄙人無從抄錄，否則寫在這兒，亦是好資料呢。</p>
<h3 id="c260">意匠發明三種熱水器 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 蓉</p>
<p>三友實業社杭廠，向來漂染用水，由蒸汽加熱，與各染廠相同，去年因天虚我生前往参觀，謂渠曩年發明一種水鼠，用於製　廠中，甚爲巧妙，大可節省時間。爰由陳萬運君，托其試造一具，用資比較，結果，同于容量之六十磅冷水，在七分鐘間，竟能加熱至攝氏八十度，而原用盤香管者，祗参加熱六十度，節省時間，達三分之一以上，即足以增加工和效率至百分之三十七之多。因托家庭工業社，特製三十八具，已在全部改裝中，據述發明之原因，因見尋常蒸氣加熱，水面泛出氣泡甚多，以致熱力耗散，逸出水面者，實佔十分之三以上，可謂浪費。爰就利用眞空噴霧之原理，製成此器，其狀有如花爆中之水老鼠，故名水鼠，使蒸汽自背部進，吸取尾端冷水，自首端噴散而出，使其水勢廻旋，循環不已，絶無汽泡泛出水面，是以加熱甚爲容易，每一立方尺之冷水，加熱至攝氏六十度，夏令不過三分鐘，冬令不過五分鐘耳，此不過爲一種方法，至其工料，甚廉，每具不過五元而已。另有一種「手形加熱器，」其原理亦同，但其用途各别，因水鼠僅能用於儲水箱中，手形則能吸取井中之水，輸送於應用塲所，變成熱水，源源不絶，吸上之力，可達二十英尺，吹上之力，可達十五尺，横流輸送，則遠近不拘，並可於中途分支兩路，出水甚急。其工料成本，每具需二十五元，如由水塔取用下壓之水，則另有一種，稱爲「過山龍」者，原理亦同水鼠，但於首端接裝水管，即可輸送横流，分支送遠，並可調節進水，能使高熱至攝氏九十度，或减低温度至攝氏三十度，以合使用之目的，每具成本，亦不過十五元耳。凡此三種加熱器，可謂神速巧妙，增加工作效率不少，惟於製作時，角度極關重要，稍有偏斜，即不能噴水成霧，反而大耗汽力，多傷煤火故每器在鑽孔時，非經發明人親自測定，用墨指點不可云。</p>
<h3 id="c261">綠色的蘋果和橘子 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 懷璩</p>
<p>這幾月來，我最怕見的是蘋果，尤其是怕見綠色的蘋果。</p>
<p>我每每走過水菓店的門前，總是把頭低了下去，或望向别處。偶然不留心，眼神經接觸了這綠油油的蘋菓，却能與我以極嚴酷的剌激。</p>
<p>往時，我在果品中，最愛吃的是蘋果。我也很愛它綠油油的含着處女美的色采。自從與伊相識後，伊的嗜好，驅同了我，使我更愛那綠色的蘋果了。</p>
<p>伊在時，最愛看的是綠的一切，尤其愛那蘋果般的淡綠。伊在校時的衣着，幾乎四季離不了這個綠的色彩。偶然買到了幾本新書，也要用綠紙，把它包上書面來。</p>
<p>不但對於蘋果，是愛那綠色的，便是别的菓品，也往往不嫌它們未成熟，而喜歡揀那綠的。</p>
<p>記得去年的年假時，我們都預備各回故鄉去。在假期的前一個星期日，我和伊的哥哥冬蔚，伴伊去買零物。冬蔚到食舖裏買橘子，伊只是把綠色的揀下來</p>
<p>這算什麽呢？冬蔚這樣地問。</p>
<p>我很可憐它！我很愛它的顔色！唉！這是它天眞的色彩。它並不用紅的整目色彩引誘我們，它是没有貢獻给外界的意思呀！萬惡的人們，爲什麽要硬生生地把它摘下來呢！</p>
<p>伊含着笑容對伊的哥哥說。</p>
<p>伊的笑，是含着感歎的笑呀！</p>
<p>事後，我曾對伊說笑首：</p>
<p>綠色的橘子，眞的没有貢獻給人們的意思麽？怕是時期没到罷？</p>
<p>伊低下頭去沈思着，始終没有替我解釋過這個問題。</p>

<p>自强拍了桌子沿道：原來你還有這樣一種好本領，爲什麽早不說，要不然，這幾天，我會天天要你唱呢。桂枝笑道：你以爲我是一個戲迷呢。今天是一種特别的情形我才道着臉皮唱起來。自强道：今天有什麽特别？桂枝道：也不過是和你餞行而已。自强笑道：到了今日，我才知道丈夫要出門，可以得着太太特别垂青的。將來我要永久出門才好。桂枝聽了臉上的顔色，未免有些變動。自强就笑着解釋道：我說的常常出門，　乃是個月回來三趟，　一月也就出門三趟，你能不能也是像今天一樣和我餞行呢。桂枝笑道：你爲了要喝二兩酒，聽我瞎唱幾句，就也跑來跑去，那也不值吧？自强道，天下事，有什麽值不值。全在各人自己評定罷了。一粒小鑽石，多的可以值幾萬。請問那有什麽用？以我而論，最愛吃烤白薯，又甜，又香，又熱，可是只要幾個銅子，人就可以吃一飽，世上的人誰都不把它當什麽，它就好不起來。這樣說，好醜没有一定的，全看人喜歡不喜歡。我覺得二兩酒，一叚兒唱不錯，就值得我來去亂路。桂枝笑道：你說的是，我再唱一叚你聽，謝謝你算我一個知己。自强手按了杯子，側了頭，又向外面聽了去，因問道：什麽時候了，這好像是打四更呢。桂枝道：這個你全不必管，我們今天晚上就是吃一點，喝一點，樂一點。（三一九）</p>

<h3 id="c263">志士不忘在天空 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 南海沙鷗</p>
<p>用統計數字來證明航空的安全性</p>
<p>「御風而行，泠然善也！」我時常憶起列禦寇的飄飄然羽化登仙的幻想；只惜自己從小不曾去學航空。</p>
<p>「航空救國」這個調兒，雖然差不多已經高唱入雲，實際上我們的「空軍」，還未出「國門」丨丨我們的領空丨丨。我們的航空技術員，數量上，技術上都是很落後。</p>
<p>「千金之子，坐不垂堂。」「君子不立乎巖牆之下，」………這些，都是養成我們「怕死劣根性」的迷醉藥。今後我們總得製成幾條新標語，新信條，例如：</p>
<p>志士不忘在「天空」！</p>
<p>勇士不忘「跌斷臂」！</p>
<p>單有信條，標語，不足以鼓勵眞實的勇氣。必須用什麽方法來鼓勵一般青年對於航空的興趣，使大家發生一種持久的狂熱，那末套着舊時鼓勵讀書的詞句，來哼著：</p>
<p>「空中」自有顔如玉!「空中」自有速雲閣！無奈這也太滑稽了。</p>
<p>先打破了「怕死」的劣根性，纔能發生冒險的興趣；於是我便找些鐵一般的事實上的統計來說明白航空的安全而非危險。</p>
<p>據澳大昨亚航空統計，最近五年内，</p>
<p>航空路程　　　九、九○一、四三一哩·</p>
<p>載客數　　　　　　二五○、五八二人·</p>
<p>遇險死亡數　　　　　　　　　三二人·</p>
<p>遇險受傷數　　　　　　　　　二一人·</p>
<p>平均每航二十二萬五千英里中跌死一人，每二十一萬英里中受傷一人。</p>
<p>一九三○年中，公辦航空行程五十九萬八千哩，載客七各八百三十五人，未嘗失事。尋常航空行程七十五萬九千哩，載客八千零九十六人中失事一次，死駕駛員一，傷旁人一。</p>
<p>據去年年底統計</p>
<p>美國平均第九十萬英里之航程中，遇難死者一人，英國平均十萬英里中死去一人。法國一百四十九萬英里中死一人。</p>
<p>這點點輕微的危險，比較市虎傷人實在不算一回什麽事。</p>
<p>飛機較汽車安全得多</p>
<p>按一九三○年，英國汽車（摩托車）傷人统計：</p>
<p>失事次數　一五六、七九三次</p>
<p>死亡數　　　　七、三○五人</p>
<p>受傷數　　一七七、八九五人</p>
<p>這樣看起來，乘坐飛機，比較坐汽車安全得多多了。爲何尋常人心理，總是當坐汽車看作平淡事情，當坐飛機爲冒險的事情呢？</p>
<p>摩托車的駛行，除了本身會發生毛病之外路上的障礙很多，隨在可以發生危險，所以撞車的惨劇是司空見慣的。至於飛機，天空中既没有電杆木，也没有任人，前後左右，上下騰降，都可自如，除掉了本身偶然發生毛病，以及天氣的變化之外，可以說没有什麽其他的障礙。照常例來推測，也安全得多多了。</p>
<p>各國近年載客飛機數</p>
<p>因此各國的民用航空，駸駸乎欲與輪船火車爭座位了。</p>
<p>國别　　機數　　載客數　　註</p>
<p>英…三四…四五、一五○·　一九三二全年</p>
<p>法…二五九…二六、八九三·　仝　上</p>
<p>意…八二…四三、三○○·　仝　上</p>
<p>德…一七八…九八、四八九·　仝　上</p>
<p>荷蘭…四三…二一、○二○·　仝　上</p>
<p>美國…五四四…二四八、九五四·　一九三三上半年</p>
<p>看了這般事實和明顯的數字，可以證明白「航空險乎哉？不險也！」於此敬祝「怕死的民族」大家「頑夫廉！懦夫有立志」！</p>

<h3 id="c303">大學生跳舞 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>上海的跳舞塲的顧客，除了尖行辦事的半紳士們外，其次最多的就是大學生。有一些大學生甚至於終夜沉醉在音樂的旋律裏，化錢揮霍之外，白天簡直遊於夢鄉，上課那是與他毫無關係。星期六之夜舞塲跳到天亮，有上課的大學生在這一夜上跳舞塲跳舞據說還是用功的學子。曾經和朋友們談到這一個問題上去，有人主張，大學生當局應該嚴禁大學生上跳舞塲，違此開除，辦法就是派員專門偵查，查出即辦。有人却以爲這一種辦法如果有某一痊大學校長嚴厲執行，一定引起風潮，不安於位；最好還是在學校裏頭每逢星期日開茶舞會，一方面只准在校内跳舞不許在校外胡行，一方面多定入門劵的價格，每張至少十元，如政府禁烟一樣地寓禁於徵。有人却又以爲這一種立法不但不會禁止大學生跳舞，恐怕反而教育全校的學生都會舞起來，那是有弊而無益的事；最好是公布出來，凡是本校學生要入跳舞塲跳舞者并不犯規只應每學期繳納禁舞費若干元，（無妨多至百元以上，）那才是寓禁於徵的合法行動。</p>
<p>摩登化的生活，在上海算是已經模倣得登峯造極的了，而大學生跳舞的生活，尤期是模倣摩登的害處之證明。我們中國對於人家摩登的内容并不模倣，可是人家摩登的外形却偏學了來，這是國家前途命脈所關的問題，并非只是生活的小事體。考跳舞在我們中國雖然「古已有之」，可是也已經早就失傳，到了帝國主義者侵略到我們中國的市塲以後，跳舞才一并被帶了來。起初不過是他們碧眼兒自已開塲跳跳，後來也就從高等華人學起，以至於現在只要肯化三角三分三跳一次舞的人，誰都沉醉如狂地摩登化起來了。（現在竟有三角三分三跳兩次舞的大减價的舞塲在招引顧客了。）大學生入學校目的在研究學問以求深造，畢業以後服務社會，如今並非在研究學問却去跳舞，這一現象固然足以證明大學教育的成爲問題，但也就可以先作預言，這一些以跳舞爲上課的大學生，將來到了社會上一定是不事生産專享幸福的寄生虫之流。憂世之士理應以此爲慮才對呵！</p>
<h3 id="c304">新年在馬路上 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 炯</p>
<p>天色漸漸黯淡起來，模糊，晚景顯得更是一幅美麗的畫圖。一輪紅日斜掛在天空，遠遠的謝進到我們的眼簾，反映出巨大剌人的光芒；樹枝毫不擺動的停立着，像是枯寂的少女，懷着無限心事似的。</p>
<p>時鐘剛敲過三嚮的午後，没有凛烈的寒風，天氣是顯得温暖；獨個兒，爲着减少整日倦伏在這斗室中的煩惱和一些悶人的氣燄，糊亂的披上舊不可言的大衣，馬虎的整了裝跑到馬路上去了，藉以發洩在家枯坐的寂聊！</p>
<p>筆直的馬路，似帶着肅殺的秋天景象。夜幕低沉，一发都籠上一層輕微含烟似的外套。靜寂的心情，悄悄的，不聲不響的踱過一條馬路再轉灣到另外一條，，這樣循環着向前進，究竟不知走到什麽地方爲止？心裏忐忑的念着，不斷的這樣念着。</p>
<p>街上除了往日舊有的熱鬧外，來來去去的行人，更顯得擁擠不堪！一大塊大簍的食品和水菓，很笨重的掛在他們各人的手中，有的坐在黄包車裏，就將所買的東西，附帶的放在包車上。啊！原來是舊歷新年到了！在我背後步行的陌生人這樣互相的歡嚷着說。</p>
<p>愈走愈覺得比先前輕快，用着飛似的脚步，不住的向前進。在這寂靜的境域中，心境没有似亂絲般的煩惱，祇是覺得在輕微飄渺的裊裊黑烟中，模糊，黯淡，什麽都辦不清！</p>
<p>舊歷新年又到了，一年是如何容易過去啊！草草的，糊塗的又度過了一個年關。在這時候，照理是該如何的，熱烈的慶幸着這新年而舉行一個隆重的典禮來誌記念？誰料竟心有餘而力不足的祇感覺新年在馬路上？</p>
<p>黯淡的空中，現出層疊與馳逐的灰雲；幾個鐘頭的漫步，這時候覺得有再不能掙扎向前進的疲乏。停住了步武，向後轉，回到家來，已是燈光照耀的傍晚了。</p>
<h3 id="c305">哥兒作家 <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>……哥兒作家不詳其姓字，</p>
<p>因爲作家氣派近乎「哥兒」</p>
<p>，故人皆以「哥兒作家」呼</p>
<p>之……</p>
<p>關上門，狐步舞式的回過身來，看看寫字檯上安排着印着自己名字的原稿箋，華德門墨水，派克筆，絞盤牌香烟，一杯白色的牛奶……心里想道：</p>
<p>「好優良的環境！寫吧！」</p>
<p>坐上轉椅，喝一口牛奶，抽一支香烟；拉整原稿箋，提起筆幹兒丨丨寫什麽呢？</p>
<p>放下筆，又是喝牛奶，抽香烟。</p>
<p>「寫什麽呢？寫小說吧，太麻煩！不她；寫詩歌吧！對！寫詩歌才能做詩人；「詩人」，這多雅緻的名詞！蜜史王說我有作詩的天才；嘿！我有作詩的天才啦」。</p>
<p>哥兒作家聳了聳肩，鬆開領帶，提起筆幹兒丨丨詩的題材眞難找呵！</p>
<p>派克筆的筆尖兒在原稿箋的邊緣上兜了幾下子，稿箋依然是雪白的稿箋，因爲筆尖是提得高高的。</p>
<p>「詩脫不了女人：荷馬，雪萊，拜輪……誰的詩里没有說女人」？</p>
<p>又是喝牛奶，抽香烟。</p>
<p>「對！總得寫女人才好」！</p>
<p>於是，墨水的痕跡隨着哥兒作家的思緒跳上了稿箋：</p>
<p>女人，我的寳貝！</p>
<p>寫完，吟了一遍，覺得太没有節奏，不行！詩總得有一種迷人的節奏，……好，法兒有啦，多簡便！加一個字就好：</p>
<p>女人！</p>
<p>我的寳貝喲！</p>
<p>哥兒作家又吟了一遍，笑容在他臉上像一朶花；這「喲」字，多麽之人呀！不，這整個的詩句。</p>
<p>挽起牛奶杯兒來，不提防牛奶没了。</p>
<p>「哈哈！」哥兒作家醒悟了似的，偉人的憧憬在他思緒里熾燃了起來丨丨從前有個大發明家瓦特，不！大約是牛頓，晤晤，恐怕也不是牛頓；一定是富蘭克林！晤晤，也有些兒不像，管他的！總之，他是個大發明家；他不是曾經把一隻錶兒當鷄子兒煮嗎？怎樣我也連牛奶杯兒乾都不知道啦！哈哈，這是一種象徵，一種象徵！</p>
<p>哥兒作家興奮得很，於是詩句也從腦筋里漏了出來：</p>
<p>女人喲！</p>
<p>我一天不見您！</p>
<p>我一天就要死哪！</p>
<p>又放下筆，又吟一遍：「音調兒眞美！情緒兒眞儂！當然囉！我有作詩的天才哩」！</p>
<p>罐里的香烟漸漸少了。</p>
<p>「寫下去！我寫滿「八行」才行」：</p>
<p>女人喲！</p>
<p>我思念您，</p>
<p>我思念您像！</p>
<p>「像什麽呢？像「口渴一般」吧！不行，太俗！像「待哺一般」吧！也不好！「待哺」兩個字是「文言」，嚇！落伍的「文言，滾開去」「！</p>
<p>我思念您像蝴蝶兒戀着花房！</p>
<p>「好極了！」哥兒作家興奮到了沸點，他想這樣的詩句眞難得呵！</p>
<p>「一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，够了，這名貴的「八行詩」！」</p>
<p>擲下筆，快活在他心里像有許多水泡泡兒；又想抽一支香烟，香烟也没有了；於是，他又打哈哈，又想瓦特，牛頓，富蘭克林……</p>
<h3 id="c306">那麽，我們找鄉下姑娘去！ <a href="#c306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— 乃碩</p>
<p>友人Ｋ君，是那麽一個滑稽的人！一時候是頭腦嶄新的，一時候却迂腐得使人作嘔。張開着魚嘴，就難得有闔閉的時候：却又有時噤若寒蟬。最喜歡挨近摩登小姐的倩影，却說自己已有十歲大的兒子。下面就是他對他的尊夫人的一道表彰，一篇頌辭。說起來，不能說没有他的道理，滑稽也就在這裏。且看：</p>
<p>「現在一般的心理，總以爲新的就是好的，不是新的就不能用，我覺得這是種時髦的病態。我素來不反對舊派的人，新的雖然日在滋生，可是舊的也仍有它存在的餘地。比如就說婚姻吧，一般人總以爲非戀愛的自由結婚，是種罪惡的結合。以爲要想得到結婚的幸福，祇有求之於新式的自由戀愛，而舊式婚姻是祗有痛苦吧了。我覺得，這種觀念，非常錯誤。因爲舊的本身並蛎就是壞的。這祗不過一個運用的問題，運用得法，舊的也能生出新的幸福來。運用不得法，即就是新的也會呈露不好的現象。</p>
<p>我是個舊式結婚的人，我的結婚就是新八股們所描寫的那幕最滑稽的把戲。在婚前我既没有看過她，也不知道她的性情，更不知道她的思想。人家說好，媒人說好，於是我的父母也覺得是好，便給我定下了。定下不久我就和她結了婚。現在我已有了兩個小孩。最會使人驚異的，就是我們之間仍舊有種濃厚的感情，和平的幸福仍是緊緊地環抱着。在她没有對我生出一點怨言，在我尤一點都不感覺另求歸宿的必要。事實是這樣，我不能不承認舊式婚姻也有它的好處。而我對於妻子具體感覺的好處，約有下面數點。</p>
<p>第一，就是她的馴良，一般的詩人常常讚美女人馴似羔羊，這只有舊式婚姻的妻子有之，至於新式的婚姻，夢都不要夢想。比如我對我的妻子，我可以要她去取茶取水，我可以要她離開我到别的地方去，也可以要她守着我整天不離身。所言必從，從没有什麽抗議與怨懟。我在她面前，可以充分地顯示我有種隠然的權威，而這權威乃是我們男性的尊嚴中所必不可少的。</p>
<p>第二，就是她的耐苦，耐苦是種美德，我是一點都不否認的。我的妻子就充滿着這種耐苦的精神。她一天到晚不但是只收拾房子裏的事情，她並要照顧孩子，洗濯衣服。此外她還須伏侍我的爹娘。若是在我，我便會惹起非常之煩厭。然而在她，她一點不煩惱，一點不怨懟。有時候儘管忙得腿子都軟了，祗要我安慰她一會，她便會微微的一笑，又會動手做起來。</p>
<p>第三，是她的温柔，是她的體貼，這種滋味是没有經過舊式婚姻的人所絶不能體味的。雖然一般的說法，總以爲要時髦的女子，才懂得女人的風情，才知道去發揮那女人性格的美點。但是，我却堅認，惟有舊式的妻子，才能够做到那温柔，體貼的極端好處。我們知道要是去鑒賞一種女人的表情，常是從她靜靜地疑視，和低眉中去微微地領略。我們知道一陣絮聒的情話，不如那深深的注視來得動人。我們也知道一陣瘋狂的擁抱，不如那默默的偎懷來得深刻。事實其所以如此者，因爲惟有從靜的姿態裏，才能領略那美的眞諦，惟有靜美才是美的上乘。回轉來說到女人，我覺得她們之所以能够更能深刻的動人，就是在她們的靜美。而能够做到這點恰到好處者，就只有那舊式的妻子。她們那種無言的投訴，深沉的凝視，以及那默默的微笑，或那默默的悲哀，眞是没有一點不動人憐愛。</p>
<p>我們知道，我們之所以結婚就是想得到一種異性肉體和靈魂的安慰。這肉和靈的安慰就是一般人所謂結婚的幸福。而這種幸福这獲得，不是一定只有從新式的結婚裏能找尋的。在我個人的見地，覺得不但新式的結婚不是唯一的幸福來源，並且它簡直没有所謂幸福。他們之所謂情愛，完全建立在金錢之有無。你嚢中纍然，她便曲盡百媚，若是床頭金盡了，她便横惡萬端，繼之是舍你而去。</p>
<p>我素來是窮的，我可就不曾愛過妻子的逼苦，原因就是舊式的妻子好過新式女人，在我們之間是具有一種純正關係結合的原故。舊的不見得都是壞的。新的也不見得便是好的模型，不作如是想，便是一般人錯誤的根源。」</p>
<p>他常有這麽一篇大道理，在朋友之間鼓舌，結果是赢得大家同道一聲：「那麽，我們找鄉下姑娘去！」哈哈哈……　　　　　　　　完</p>

<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>這十足道地的「老牌國貨」底「新年」亦終於在鑼鼓爆竹聲中很快地流過了多天了。但是在昨晚（十七）很異樣地那「高升」，「黄鞭」的「逼，迫，窮，怕」之聲竟連續不斷地鬧了一個整夜。原來昨日正是所謂「財神日」也，因此各店主正在熱烈地「接財神」咧！</p>
<p>聽吧！「黄鞭」的尖銳底「逼，迫」之聲，「高升」的洪大底「窮，怕」之聲，驚魂動魄地充滿了整個的「城市之夜」的硫磺底氛圍中，這不如在今日世界經濟恐慌的激盪中，一般的商店之主都在大聲地作最後的悲痛底呌喊，以乞告於他們想像中的「神通廣大」的「財神菩薩」嗎？並且在每一家店舖中的桌子上佈滿了各色佳肴，以對這被「逼，迫，窮，怕」的凄惨之聲所心動而光臨後的「財神菩薩」作誠虔的祀祭，這不是想以一席之宴「諂媚之而望他把「財」多多地賜給他們嗎？</p>
<p>但是想去年的昨晚不是也同樣地來過一下嗎？看吧！在無法中招盤，倒閉而「關門大吉」的不可勝數的商店不計外，單祇滬上最繁華的南京路中爲欠六個月以上的房金而被控的竟有一百七十餘家（？）之多了。那末這位「財神」在「誠虔的祀祭」上大嚼一通後，究竟盡了些什麽「義務」呢？</p>
<p>記得在某部小說中談過一句很「幽默」的對話：「你天天禱告嗎。因爲禱告的人太多了，所以上帝實無暇來聽你的了」。事實不是也告訴我們在這樣的社會组織裏面，即使天天敬虔地把這「菩薩」倿來祀祭在店中，但好有什麽的「神通」來挽救了避去這危險而「復興市塲」，「榮繁上海」呢？</p>

<h3 id="c308">國貨年工廠用日貨 <a href="#c308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個很可憐的青年工人。</p>
<p>你老好像是我們一個救苦救難的慈航一樣，我對於</p>
<p>你老的業餘信箱是很信仰的。</p>
<p>我現在有一個很難解决的問題，請你老指教。什麽問題呢？就是我們廠内所用的工具，一向全是國貨，現在好像是感覺到一二八的好處一樣，購來大批日貨，迫我們工人去做。想我們也有很良好的國貨，同時在此國貨年間，理應提倡國貨，挽回利權，方是爲國人的道理：而且日本人也是我們的一個敵人，如我們用他們的貨，豈非送錢給他們買子彈打我們，此不是可痛嗎！我雖不贊成廠方此種舉動，不做工去和廠方抵抗吧，奈生活問題，又不能解决。</p>
<p>佻老看，處此環境，威力，壓迫之下，有什麽辦法去抵抗不做，和廠方講理呢？請</p>
<p>先生早日在報上答覆我吧。祝你老康健　　蔡摶九鞠躬。二月一日</p>
<p>編者按：這封信收到已有二十天，編者當初拆閱這封信後，雖則對於此種事實有無窮感觸，但還以爲像這樣喪心病狂的「廠方」是决計没有的。然而，後來編者對此事一再思之，更回憶及去年報上有某八廠「冒牌國貨」案件，則此種事實不特不是没有，並且决計是有的。我們若用正確的方法，冷靜的態度，去分析現社會的社會現象，是一定可以這樣說的。</p>
<p>讀者看了這封信以後，心中一定要奇怪：「廠方」何以會喪心病狂到如此，而工人却能這樣的清高。「廠方」之用日貨無非是想多賺兩個錢，但他們都是生活安閒的人，少賺些錢並不打緊，竟敢如此的不要臉而甘冒天下之大不韙；工人失業就無辦法，而且他是給人家做事，旁人是决計不會駡他，說他是不應該做日貨的，但他却總規不情願，總想與廠方講理，這樣看來，此二者間人格之高下，豈非有霄壤之别，然而不是的，其中蓋另有原因在。</p>
<p>中國的一切企業，在現在帝國主義掌握之下，它們雖則有時想獨立反抗，但反來抗去，終究跳不出佛祖爺的手心。因爲現社會的一切企業，「營利」是它們的唯一目的，違反了這種目的而甘願以賠本爲宗旨，則企業不但不能存在，辦企業的人也是决無這種念頭的，所以辦企業的人固然希望他們的企業一方面能賺錢，一方面亦能爲社會謀福利，然而如果爲社會謀福利不能辦到，甚至有害於社會，那祗要他的企業能賺錢，他也終究是要辦的。現在世界都鬧着經濟恐慌，都行着貶價傾銷政策，而在我國，則既無强固的關稅壁壘，反有一切不平等條約，試想我們企業在此種環境之下，那能與外人競爭，所以企業在現在要想存在，丨即能賺錢，是十分艱難的。而不得已做做「冒牌國貨」生意，雖非情有可原，却是另有苦衷。</p>
<p>因此，受到帝國主義者的剥削壓迫的是一般勤勞民衆，至於上述的那種爲虎作倀或將自己所受到的痛苦轉嫁於民衆的企業家買辦階級等則反是，他們雖則也不甘「依人作嫁」但他們倒底能依賴着帝國主義者生存，不像一般民衆是不但不能依賴，反而被剥削，壓迫到要命。所以，惟有一般勤苦民衆，讒具有百折不撓的反帝决心。</p>
<p>現在再說提倡國貨。現在提倡國貨者有兩種理由：第一，爲掙斷帝國主義者加在我們身上的經濟鎖鍊，所謂即「抵制外貨，挽回利權」是也；第二是想謀民族經濟之發展，因而使社會安全，換句話說，即請求「國富」。初看起來，這種理由頗爲充足。然從實際上言，則提倡國貨實現已頗有困難，而前二種目的更難達到。我們前面已經說過，國貨與外貨自由競爭之不易，因爲「國貨」之行銷，須靠「價廉物美」，單恃愛國熱誠是不濟事的。並且，經濟侵略是帝國主義者對於殖民地和弱小民族的唯一希望。在殖民地没有反抗覺悟之前，那它們就套上親善假面具，用「商業競爭」政策，但如果商業競爭不行，那就老實不客氣，用政治手段解决，飛機大砲一齊都來。所以帝國主義者對於弱小民族，總要加上許多政治上鎖鍊，如我國的不平等條約之類，因爲這是「經濟侵略」的保障。所以弱小民族要用「提倡國貨」法來反帝也是不濟事的。</p>
<p>提倡國貨固能振興民族經濟，但是我們現在我們大家所朝夕禱企的，是社會安寗，民生優裕，是故「民族經濟」之發展，也要以能否達到這些目的爲前程。美國的民族經濟是發達極了，國是富極了。然而國富也不是得就是「民裕」（少數「民」是極富的，多數人却鬧窮。）我們祇要看到美國現在還天天渴望「復興」，企圖彌補經濟恐慌，安定社會，减少失業，就可知社會的安定與否，民生之能否優裕，急急乎求「富」是不濟事的，是另有解决途徑的。</p>
<p>因此，「提倡國貨」，若爲社會上人人謀福利計，則不特不敢反對（反對者即係喪心病狂）而且是人人所應馨香禱祝的。而在現狀下，就提倡國貨者所持之理由言，則提倡國貨與數十年前孺慕外國人船堅砲利，因而但知僅求「國富兵强」者實無以異；其舍本逐末，無補於社會，民族是一樣的。然而我們對於現在的「提倡國貨」雖覺得不是根本解决民生辦法，却也不反對，而像那個「廠方」這樣的使用日貨，則更深恨痛絶。</p>
<p>蔡君所問的，所需要的，是「抵抗不做，和廠方講理」的辦法，而編者却對於時下的「提倡國貨」說了一大篇，誠屬文不對題。我們對於此種事實之發生，實有無窮感慨，和不得不說出者；但辦法郤要是要講的。現在就說辦法。</p>
<p>若能不顧一切，那「抵抗不做」是毫無問題的，蔡君也無須寫信到本信箱來，辭職有什麽問題呢？然而若要想到辭工後就要無辦法，同時辭了工，廠方仍源源的買用日貨，這樣，問題就大了，然也不是毫無辦法的；這是亦有辦法亦無辦法的。因爲這問題的中心，是能否使廠方降心相從，倒不是感動它，使它良心發現。所以要是個人抵抗不做，是决計無辦法丨丨廠方怕你一個人做甚，它是可以辭去你的；然而要是大家都很憤恨，都要和廠方講理，那末，恐怕廠方因「衆怒難犯」是會接受你的和你們的要求的。所以編者所能供獻蔡君的辦法，是向同事們商議，大家一道向要求廠方「停用日貨」。</p>

<p>「呵，她駡我賣Ｘ的。咳！」這驚訝却是輕微的。「在家門口長大的人，誰不知道誰。她這樣亂講我，我就依她麽？我把她上代賣Ｘ的賬都翻出來了。我說他的大婭頭偷過吳乾泰的大小老板。她的二女兒養私貨，三女兒才十六歲，就害Ｘ。我一頓嚼，把老貨縮進龜洞裏，不敢作聲，就這樣就不敢再提了。呵，你看氣不氣人？」她微笑着看男的。</p>
<p>男人吞吞吐吐地說，「那自然呵。這口氣誰也要出的。」</p>
<p>「怎不是的，」三姑娘繼續說，「我並不是好同人家動嘴動舌的，她硬要找着我，我也就不能缩頭了。現在她又和我好了。想想眞是没有話講。」</p>
<p>「自然，自然。」男人燒着烟，做出關心的樣子聽她說，心裏另外盤算着别的事情。</p>

<h3 id="c311">自由發展中的法國電影界的概况 <a href="#c311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>因爲法國影片很少輸入我國的緣故，所以國人業於法國的電影都没有正確的認識。因此，在這裏我想把法國電影界的概况約略地介紹在下，想秘是讀者諸君所歡迎的吧！</p>
<p>第一，我們應該知道的是，法國是一個歷史很古的，並且是個人自由很發達的國家。因爲歷史很古，所以電影的作品上，亦産生出許多的典型和流派；又因爲要發揮個人的自由，所以影片製作者，亦都隨着他們各自的個性，製作送各種各樣的影片。從這一點我們可以知道，法國的影片的内容是五花八門的，不能一概地論它是怎樣怎樣的。譬如有兩部同樣的可以覩見法人製作影片的根本的觀念和感情的片子，然而其他的一切都各自持有不同的形式和内容。由此可以想見，我們是斷不能從一部或兩部影片，而推測全部的法國電影。</p>
<p>上面曾經說過，在法國個人都唱着各自的自由，這在影片公司上亦可以看出這種現象。在法國我們看見小公司的羣雄割據的狀態。這些小公司都各自决定了某種目標，才開始攝製影片的。而不是一年到頭，不停地製作着的。所以有一年祗製一二部影片的公司，亦有祇爲攝製一部影片而創辦的公司。這種小公司的叢生，一方面固然有製作大公司以外的，含有新味的影片的貢獻，但是在他方面，亦有粗製濫造的缺點。要之，在法國的電影界各種各樣的影片製作者，都在各自的意識和企圖下行動着，供給觀衆以種種不同性質的影片。</p>
<p>現在法國的最大的影片公司就是（Patia　Natan）這公司擁有許多優秀的導演和明星，並且在法國全境都有該公司特約的電影院。我們可以說，該公司執有法國電影界的牛耳。</p>
<p>在最近的一二年來，法國的影片中很少有創作的故事，而大抵都是小說以及戲劇的電影化。這種傾向，一方面固然是因爲戲劇界的人們（如戲劇演員，戲劇作家）的進入電影界，而他方面亦因爲已經爲世界所知的作品，將之搬上銀幕，是一種比較的安全的方法。</p>
<p>將這類的影片大别之，可以分爲下列兩種；其一是古來的着名的電影化，這可以說是一種藝術品。其二是不過是使人們娛樂的滑稽片。在後者中，盡量地採用着歌舞和音樂是無待言的，並且在法國，這種輕快的幽默性質的作品是再豐富没有的了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c312">博愛里 <a href="#c312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>The　Bowery丨大上海映</p>
<p>衣冠不整的形相，飽歷風塵的歌女，粗獷蠻横的流氓，拉長了嗓子的呌囂，濔漫的烟霧，嘈雜的一羣下流社會中人的跳躍。這便是「博愛里」所描繪的一切。</p>
<p>美國的出兵古巴，就是美國門羅主義的發展張揚勵。於是「博愛里」便利用了這個題目，在太平洋風雲緊急的今日來鼓吹宗主國的威力。</p>
<p>這裏「博愛里」顯然與蘇聯的「生路」具有兩樣的意義，雖然它們都是描寫流氓，流浪者的，。後者指出流浪的孩子該組織起來，爲廣大的民衆的利益與社會的建設而犧牲，而「博愛里」是要流氓無産者去参加瘋狂的帝國主義戰爭，爲社會的廣大民衆的利益而建設，是歷史的向上，而帝國主義戰爭是應該反對的。</p>
<p>演出上，導演PaulWalsh有非常的成功。不但是全劇的靜的與動的韻律相互恊調，而且畫面的處理，顯然是很謹愼，聰敏，生動的。假如說「博愛里」能够得到很可讚賞的收穫，不可磨滅的功動該屬於這位導演，也非過分。</p>
<p>吉克進酒肆時的入羣的脫帽歡呼，正有力地反襯了後來失勢時人們的不理不睬和侮弄。</p>
<p>描寫吉克的粗暴，則以其撃暈歌女，撃樂師等人，並在燃雪茄時一聞小爆裂聲　　雪茄而作攻撃狀等微末處刻劃出之。</p>
<p>在则當失火時，一男子去救火，女即竊其褲袋内的錢物很細膩的暴露所謂下流社會的醜惡。</p>
<p>吉克遇露茜，挈之返家後，小孩斯槐浦嫌惡露茜，爲吉克責打，斯槐浦憤而携其玩具和二猶離開吉克家丨這裏描寫得那個野孩子這麽可愛，雖然賈克古柏表演是成功的一半原因。而那歌女飲醉後，出馬車跳舞，伏窗上唱歌等，簡直把嘈雜的博愛里美化得像一百詩了。</p>
<p>吉克失勢後，吉克的照片摘下，換上史迪的照片；吉克愀然下階，受衆人的侮弄；吉克悲愴地低下頭默默捫弄錶鍊；以及吉克離家時，置皮箱於桌，送錢給露茜：露推辭，吉强之：吉提了皮包，緩緩走向門；吉開門，痛苦地抬起頭來望望屋中的一切，直到露茜掩臉哭泣，都是片中至精警的地方，</p>
<p>配音方面，和畫面的聯系很活潑而貼切。如吉克見斯槐浦睡在床上，吉與女接吻時的纎細的音樂，如史迪落水不起時的狂鳴的汽笛……</p>
<p>對白中有幾句也該提出說一說的，如露茜對史迪說：「你現在是違犯了法律」。而史迪回說：「法律也許是錯誤的」。演員中自以華雷斯皮萊爲最佳，賈克古柏餐，喬奇賴甫，費萊，及飾啞吧藝術家諸人都很努力。</p>
<h3 id="c313">評「飛燕驚鴻」 <a href="#c313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Dancing　Lady　大光明</p>
<p>也許自己是一個非常鈍感的人，有些影片看過之後，常覺得無話可說。這自然是看過这後，對於自己毫無印象。</p>
<p>「飛燕驚鴻」也同樣是對於我不會發生何種濃重興味的影片。然而我想也不完全是因爲自己鈍感的原故，到底是影片本身没有什麽價值的原故，</p>
<p>一般的說，美國影片多有輕浮淡薄的東西，這對於在現社會中深感着人生之沉重的人們，無論如何是難有閒情逸緻來接受這輕微的淺笑。正因爲如此，假使電影藝人緊抓着現實的題材針剌着我們的生活，而引起了我們内心情感的時候，那末我們將必然的爲之感動。當然這並不是要求美國製片者給與我們精神上的滿足，因爲這未免可笑；不過是我們對於那種輕鬆淡薄的作品一點意見罷了。</p>
<p>「飛燕驚鴻」毫無疑義的是一部輕薄的作品，這在整個的膠片上展露着那種不痛不癢的情調。和每一個庸俗的作品一樣，祇是描畫了一幅男女糾紛的所謂愛情的圖畫。也許編劇者要想在這點之外，再來一些爲藝術而藝術的點綴，好像一碗陽春麵上面，加上幾條肉絲一樣。本來，爲藝術而藝術，就不是如何時髦的東西，何况在這裏又是這般輕微無力。</p>
<p>總而言之，這裏的故事，毫無意味，無非是平凡庸俗的穿插。假使說那一位女郎爲了自身之前途，而和那一位頗有財勢的省年相糾纒，多少展示了一點金錢之魔力，然而這何嘗又不是平凡之極。</p>
<p>至於歌舞塲面，也並不是何等了不起，並不像「華清春暖」那般充分的顯示資本主義之浮面的繁華。也許在劇中導演者也多少展開了一些聰明的手法，如瓊克勞馥追隨着克拉克蓋勃的時候，用着最快的Tempo，頗爲有趣。又如在健身房中的種種，也還生動。然而就在這些地方，成就了輕鬆的風格。至於男女主角的演藝，也無特長。</p>
<p>最後，也許有人說，將批評的水凖，提得太高，不過對於電影技術如此進步的美國片，爲什麽要降低水凖呢？</p>

<p>— 笏巨</p>
<p>安東尼歐眼瞪着她道：「當初你爲什麽不告訴我你是誰呢？」克利斯丁娜覺得他的聲音温和了好些了，於是她很高興的道：「我常常感謝上帝，居然能有那一次微服出遊的機會。在全世界萬萬人之中，能和你相會。我之於你，並不是什麽女王，不過一個尋常女子而已。在那個時候，我不在坐在黄金寳座上的儡傀。不過現在你看了我這種裝扮，一切的美麗歡樂，不是一筆拘銷了嗎？那你爲什麽要呌我告诉你我的地位，去催促一切美麗歡樂的急速消滅呢？」安東尼歐歎了口氣道：「爲了你，我竟犯了欺君之罪了」。克利斯丁娜問道：「欺君之罪？」安東尼歐道：如果「個人派遣了一個朋友，去向一個女子求愛……」克利斯丁娜插嘴道：「笑話，你的使命有什麽愛在裏面呢；不過歐洲棋局上的一着巧妙的棋子罷了。但是我們在那個雪封的小客店裏所說的，倒是……」</p>
<p>安東尼歐斷然地道：「以前的一切，我們都不用再提了，譬如没有的一樣。」克利斯丁娜一臉的歡喜都消滅了。她淡淡然道：「好吧。那你就進行你的使命，設法使我答應你的請求吧。」安東尼歐眼瞪着她，恨恨地道：「如果我說了一句話，就要受死刑的處份的話，我亦不能不說。你眞是一個皇家的淫婦。你該怎樣地笑我愚蠢幼稚。好了，我告訴你吧，自從我離開了你，我還日夜夢想着你，坐臥不安哩！好，你的勝利是完完全全的。還要什麽？」他說完了回過身去。克利斯丁娜走近他的身，將頭抬着向着他道：「祇要這個。」安東尼歐道：「請你把我打發走吧。」克利斯丁娜的聲音充滿了熱情說道：「我們的愛是精誠無間的，我現在更加相信了。你爲什麽還要違背你的志願，而將我推開呢。我們所說的話，還能更變吧？我們的愛，能變更嗎？……」</p>
<p>安東尼歐再也不能克制自己的心了。他突然間跪了下去，呌着：「克利斯丁娜，我最親愛的」。她撫摸着他的頭髮。外面音樂隊奏着細細的西班牙音樂，正是那天雪夜在旅舍中安東尼歐待從們所奏的調子。克利斯丁娜問安東尼歐道：「安東尼歐，你記得嗎？」安東尼歐突然間站了起來，將克利斯丁娜擁抱着，於是他們的愛，又相合無間了。但是皇室裏面的愛，不比平民的愛，是常常愛極大的勢力來破壞的。這裏最大的破壞勢力，就是度支大臣麥格納斯。他利用了查爾斯親王，並且利用了民衆的力量，因爲民間受了首相奥森斯提那的示意，早已成了一個反對國王嫁給外國的心，而對於西班牙王却尤其反對，因爲他是信舊教的君主，而瑞典是一個新教的國家。等到事情越來越兇險起來，首相奥森斯提那雖明知麥格納斯和查爾斯的險謀，但却已無法阻止了·（未完）</p>

<p>The Donggan Hui Army Arrives in Kashgar</p>
<p>The Pseudo-Government Personnel Flee the City</p>
<p>New Delhi: According to a telegram received today from Kashgar, the civil war in Xinjiang has now seen astonishing developments. The president, prime minister, and other officials of the so-called Islamic Republic government have all fled without a fight. On February 6, 6,000 soldiers of the Donggan Tumin Army suddenly arrived in Kashgar, threatening the government, and the government officials had no choice but to abandon the city and flee. Kashgar's new city, where the Islamic Republic government was located, is now free of fighting and looting. This development can be seen as an important victory for the Nanjing government, as the Donggan tribes recognize themselves as fighting for the Republic of China, while the so-called Islamic Republic government has declared its secession from the Republic of China. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Times commented on the rebellion of the Muslim tribes in Chinese Xinjiang and the establishment of an independent government, saying that the British Indian government would not encourage any behavior that betrayed the Chinese government, regardless of its form. The newspaper said, "The Kashgar Muslim government has sent representatives to the capitals of Turkey, Afghanistan, and Persia, as well as to Delhi, India, to request recognition from those governments, or in other words, to request permission to purchase arms and transport them to Xinjiang. As far as India is concerned, the Muslim government's approach can be said to be extremely presumptuous, because Xinjiang is a province of China, and the British government has friendly relations with China. How can it contact the rebels? For the sake of the rebels, it is better to seek a solution with the Nanjing government when the situation is still salvageable. This is the only advice we give to the rebels." (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Zhangcun and Hengcun Are Completely Recovered</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Lichuan, Zhangcun, and Hengcun are located on the Jiangxi-Fujian border, serving as transportation gateways and trade hubs between eastern Jiangxi and western Fujian. The two villages have a population of nearly 20,000 and are surrounded by steep mountains, making them strategically important. Militarily, they are the main route to Jianning and TaiNing counties in Fujian to the east and the shortcut to Guangchang and Ningdu to the south. They are also the main transportation hub between Lichuan and Nanfeng, so bandits have used this as their stronghold for a long time. After the National Army recovered Dongqi Tuan Village and Deshengguan in Lichuan, the bandits, in a final desperate struggle, deployed their main force, the 1357 Army Corps, in the area near Zhangcun and Hengcun, constructing fortifications and relying on the terrain to defend their positions. After the National Army launched a fierce attack for several days and nights, they finally defeated their main force and captured countless prisoners.

<h3 id="e26">Japan's Issue of Discipline and the Saito Cabinet <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Since the assassination of Inukai Tsuyoshi and the rise of Saito Makoto, Japanese parliamentary politics has shown its decline, while the power of the military has surged uncontrollably. However, since the outbreak of the "September 18th" Incident, Japan's domestic economic panic has become increasingly acute, and the rural problem has become even more serious. Politicians generally believe that this is a good opportunity to attack the military in order to maintain their lives. Therefore, they first exposed the so-called issue of military discipline to embarrass the military clique, and then exposed the bribery scandal of the Minister of Education to lay the groundwork for the downfall of the cabinet.</p>
<p>The evidence for the bribery scandal of the Minister of Education, Hatoyama Ichiro, exposed by Okamoto Ichiki, a member of the Seiyukai, is recorded in the prosecutor's office, which is by no means comparable to unfounded rumors. It reminds people of the fact that the Japanese education sector is impoverished. The teachers' salaries are in arrears, making it difficult for them to make a living. Therefore, various temptations have taken advantage of the opportunity to advance. The scandal of bribery in the education sector, from elementary schools to the highest institutions of learning such as Nagasaki Medical University, has long been spread throughout the country. Now, even the highest educational administrative leader is colluding in this. The reflection of the so-called issue of discipline is truly noteworthy. Moreover, since the occurrence of the Tatsukawa Professor Incident, the freedom to conduct academic research in Japan has become mere empty talk. However, the repercussions have not only affected ordinary teachers and students in the lower classes, who are willing to be infected by the deterioration, but even the children of the Gakushuin, who have received aristocratic education, cannot avoid leaning to the left. From this, it can be inferred that the entire Japanese society is filled with corruption and deterioration. The issue of discipline caused by Hatoyama's bribery is only one aspect of it.</p>
<p>However, whether the uproar of the issue of discipline caused by the exposure by a member of parliament is a sign of the resurgence of parliamentary politics is still doubtful. The fact that all major political parties in Japan rely on the support of special financial groups, such as the Seiyukai's reliance on the Mitsui financial group and the Minseito's reliance on the Mitsubishi financial group, has long been an open secret. The fact that the South Manchurian Railway is the financial source for the ruling party is also well known and cannot be deeply denied. Therefore, it is self-inflicted to cause resentment among the people and encounter attacks from the military. Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, the clumsy policies of the military have taken the opportunity to rise. The shortcomings of Japanese parliamentary politics have been completely exposed, and the shortcomings of military politics cannot be compensated. The weak Saito cabinet has been able to maintain the life of its so-called transcendent cabinet due to the mutual restraint between the military and political parties. On the one hand, it claims to be leading through extraordinary times and introducing constitutional normalcy. On the other hand, it is still inevitably subject to the control of the military. Logically speaking, it is not easy for the current cabinet, as a mixed cabinet that transcends political parties and wavers between the two major parties, to carry out the so-called affairs of an extraordinary time. For the military, it is only borrowing it to perfunctorily maintain the facade of constitutional politics and continue to promote military policies.</p>
<p>Now that the issue of discipline has broken out, the future of the cabinet is in serious crisis. It is doubtful whether Saito, who is currently claiming illness, can continue to hold office. However, even if the Saito cabinet collapses, Suzuki or Wakatsuki are unlikely to form a cabinet alone. Since the parliament is not easy to control and the relationship with the military is even more difficult to fulfill satisfactorily, the restoration of the so-called constitutional norm is likely to become a fantasy. In the future, regardless of whether Kazuhiko Yada, Fumimaro Konoe, or Korekiyo Takahashi and others are appointed to form a cabinet, they will inevitably flaunt the beautiful name of national unity and rely on the whims of the army and navy. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Shocking!! Will Germany Recognize the Puppet Manchukuo? <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Losing Trade in China</p>
<p>Further Undermining the League of Nations' Stance</p>
<p>American Media Believe Germany Wouldn't Be So Unwise</p>
<p>Washington is Considering How to Respond</p>
<p>(New York) A reporter stationed in Tokyo for the "Guidance Report," when discussing the possibility of Germany recognizing "Manchukuo," stated that if Germany recognized "Manchukuo," it would inevitably lose a portion of its trade with China. Therefore, Germany must first consider whether the future trade it gains from "Manchukuo" can compensate for its losses. At the same time, it must consider whether it is unwise to further strike the League of Nations by undermining the League's decision not to recognize "Manchukuo," a decision in whose passage Germany itself had participated. (TASS dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Only eight days after Puyi changed his title to "Emperor of Manchukuo" and ascended the throne, government officials and the national press here are once again paying close attention to the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo." President Roosevelt stated today during a meeting with reporters that the matter is quite complex and he is unwilling to make any pronouncements until he has consulted with the Secretary of State. Recently, some have argued that the United States, having joined hands with Russia, should immediately recognize "Manchukuo" so that American trade in "Manchukuo" can increase. However, most people suspect that if the United States recognizes "Manchukuo," American trade with China will be greatly affected. The New York Daily News is even actively promoting the idea that recognizing "Manchukuo" would be sufficient to develop American commerce. However, according to important figures in Washington, they do not believe there is any possibility of recognizing "Manchukuo," and the matter of Puyi's ascension to the throne is completely unrelated to the United States. (National News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, Japan seems to intend to make American recognition of "Manchukuo" a prerequisite for Japan's participation in the 1935 naval conference. However, as of now, Japan has not yet made this request, because "Manchukuo" is currently unable to protect American citizens from bandit attacks. If the United States were to recognize it, it would actually put "Manchukuo" in a difficult position. However, American officials are quite concerned about Japan's intentions. Once the effective term of the London Naval Treaty is about to expire, will the United States ultimately decide to strictly adhere to the principle of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" announced by former Secretary of State Stimson, or will it engage in another arms race in the Pacific? Which of these two options will the United States abandon? At that time, it may be inevitable that there will be some wavering. It is rumored that certain European countries will recognize "Manchukuo" imminently. Diplomatic circles believe that Germany may take this action, because after Germany recognizes it, both sides will benefit economically. Manchuria exports 3 million tons of soybeans annually, of which 1 million tons are shipped to Germany. Last year, Germany imposed a heavy import tax on soybeans, which greatly affected Manchurian soybeans. Its inventory has reached 2 million tons. If Germany recognizes "Manchukuo," it will definitely sign a commercial treaty with it, and in the future, "Manchukuo" will export soybeans to Germany and use the proceeds to purchase German goods, benefiting both sides. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) People here have heard rumors that certain European countries will soon recognize "Manchukuo" and are eager to understand what attitude the United States will take if such a situation occurs. Judging from the news coming out of the White House today, the United States will naturally consider such a situation if it develops, but the doctrine announced by former Secretary of State Stimson, namely not recognizing countries created by force or aggression, may not be implemented mechanically. (Note: On January 7, 1932, the United States sent notes to China and Japan stating that the United States could not recognize Japan's occupation of Manchuria as legal, and that the system established after the occupation, because it violated the Open Door Policy and the Nine-Power Treaty, could not be recognized. On February 24 of the same year, Stimson reiterated the need to maintain China's Open Door Policy in his letter to Senator Borah and recognized the necessity of maintaining the Washington Nine-Power Treaty.)

<p>(New York) The New York newspaper's Washington dispatch stated that the United States has a tendency to adopt a moderate attitude towards the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo."

<h3 id="e29">The Atmosphere in the Japanese Upper House Deteriorates Sharply, a Vigorous Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Takahashi Serves as Acting Prime Minister</p>
<p>Seeking Parliamentary Approval</p>
<p>The Seiyukai Advocates a Grand Coalition of Political Parties</p>
<p>Councilor Sunada Vigorously Criticizes the Government for Incompetence</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Budget Committee of the Upper House, due to Prime Minister Saito and Agriculture Minister Goto being ill and other cabinet members unable to attend, has made no progress in deliberations. Of the 24 people who had notified that they would ask questions, only four have completed their questioning. For example, Count Katsuta only reserved his questions for Prime Minister Saito, and others withdrew their questions. As a result, some advocated extending the budget deliberation period, but there were also considerable objections. However, the atmosphere in the Upper House is showing signs of deterioration due to the sluggish state of Prime Minister Saito and others, and the entire atmosphere is moving towards a movement to overthrow the cabinet. (Dentsu dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to Prime Minister Saito's inability to attend the Upper House, the budget general meeting is planning to extend the session to the 25th. According to the doctor, the Prime Minister will have difficulty attending the session even on the 26th. In order to resolve the budget proposal, the Japanese government plans to decide on a temporary prime minister at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. It is heard that Finance Minister Takahashi will assume this position to deal with the Diet. (United Chinese Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, due to Prime Minister Saito's illness and inability to attend the Diet, the Upper House requested the government to appoint a temporary acting prime minister who would only be responsible for answering questions in the Diet without any legal basis. After Secretary-General Horikiri reported this to Prime Minister Saito and obtained the Prime Minister's consent, he visited Finance Minister Takahashi and Interior Minister Yamata. The two ministers consulted at 11 a.m. this morning and decided to accept the Upper House's proposal and appoint Finance Minister Takahashi to serve in this position. In the afternoon, Secretary-General Horikiri met with various factions of the Upper House, reported the government's decision, and requested formal recognition of Finance Minister Takahashi's appointment as temporary acting prime minister. (United Chinese Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Fifty-two members of the Seiyukai's Grand Coalition faction, including Azuma and Kinoshita, held a meeting last night at the Shiba San'entei to deliberate on the methods for promoting the party's unification movement. They resolved that in order to overcome the difficult situation, they must seek sincere unity. To unite the various political parties, they should start with self-awareness. Based on the Japanese ideology of "one sovereign and ten thousand people" and the spirit of the party, they want to seek the grand unity of the party. With this policy, they selected executive committee members to visit various factions and seek their participation. By this morning, 64 people from various factions had already joined. With these 84 people as initiators, they issued invitations to Diet members from various factions, seeking their participation, and scheduled a general meeting for the 25th. Although this movement is called a "grand coalition," it is actually not very beneficial to the Suzuki faction. (United Chinese Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's plenary session of the House of Representatives was declared open by Speaker Akita at 1:25 p.m. After reporting on various bills, Mr. Sunada Shigemasa of the Seiyukai took the stage to speak on the matter of proceeding with the agenda, declaring:</p>
<p>The session is now more than halfway over, but important bills have not yet been submitted. The Prime Minister and the Agriculture Minister claim to be ill and have not been seen attending the Diet. In this situation, what is the point? We have no choice but to conclude that the government lacks enthusiasm for deliberating on important cases. From this perspective, there is a need for an acting minister to handle affairs. No proposals have yet been found for rural relief bills. What is the reason? Now, although we hear that the National Alliance will submit a motion of no confidence, the government should make clear whether it intends to submit important proposals related to the lives of the people. If we know that the government is incompetent, after confirming it, we should resolutely submit a motion of no confidence. Before today's meeting is adjourned, we should ask the responsible government officials to give a clear answer.</p>
<p>Speaker Akita declared,</p>
<p>The gist of Mr. Sunada's speech is to warn the government. Now that the three ministers of the army, navy, and iron are present, they may be able to represent the government and provide an explanation, or it is not impossible.</p>
<p>Minister Sanshi Tetsu replied that he would now represent the government and answer:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has already stated at the budget general meeting that various proposals and additional budgets for rural countermeasures are now being devised to be submitted as soon as possible. This has been delayed due to the illness of Agriculture Minister Goto, but it can be decided and seconded recently.</p>
<p>Next, Ms. Toda Yumi of the National Alliance raised a question: Why has the speaker not earnestly deliberated on the motion of no confidence submitted by the National Alliance? Why do the Seiyukai and the Minseito want to prevent the deliberation of the motion of no confidence and adopt such a despicable attitude?</p>
<p>Ms. Toda criticized the contradictions of the Seimin parties and desperately called for support for the deliberation of the motion of no confidence.</p>
<p>Speaker Akita replied:</p>
<p>The motion of no confidence submitted by the National Alliance has already been listed on the agenda, but it has not yet come up in the rotation.</p>
<p>The Diet members of the National Alliance then advocated submitting an urgent motion to change the agenda, but it was rejected due to a minority. The Diet members of the Seimin parties then stormed out of the Diet. After that, they discussed the Export Law Amendment Bill (Trade Control Law) and other laws, which were all entrusted to committees separately. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The investigation committee on the Okamoto Kazumi case has been opened three times. The illegal activities of Minister of Education Hatoyama and other political party members have been gradually revealed. The Diet members of the National Alliance and the First Control Office, with the support of nationalist groups such as the Kodo Society, the Meirin Society, and the Kokuhonsha, will do their utmost to expose the crimes of political party members, and will also reveal incidents such as the Seiyukai elder Teijiro Yamamoto receiving a bribe of 50,000 yen and former Prime Minister Hamaguchi Yuko receiving a bribe of 100,000 yen, thereby arousing public resentment against political parties. The Seiyukai and the Minseito, having learned of this news, are very concerned and have decided to find a way to prevent the situation from escalating. After the investigation committee reopens once or twice, they will decide to end it with the majority force of the Seimin parties in order to prevent Okamoto from taking the opportunity to expose various crimes as much as possible, and have also decided to punish Okamoto for the crime of intentionally harming the reputation of others through his speech, in accordance with the Diet Law.

<p>(Tokyo) In order to properly handle the international economic war, the three ministries of Finance, Commerce and Industry, and Foreign Affairs are studying legislation related to trade and commerce. A general consensus has already been reached. The Commerce Deliberation Council will be held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 23rd to determine the government's final policy, which is scheduled to be submitted to the Diet next week. The content of the bill is quite simple, namely, if foreign countries set high tariffs or prevent imports, or take any unfriendly measures against Japanese commerce, the government may take appropriate measures as necessary. The authority is extremely inclusive and broad, giving the government dictatorial power over trade countermeasures to deal with the pressure from various countries. (Dentsu dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>The British Persist in Not Yielding to Japan</p>
<p>The Meeting Next Wednesday is Worth Watching</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a dispatch from London, the official meeting of the Anglo-Japanese spinning industry opened at 10:30 a.m. on the 20th and discussed for three and a half hours. However, due to the issue of geographical scope, no results were obtained, and negotiations were extended to the 28th. It is heard that at that day's meeting, representatives from both the British and Japanese sides insisted on their own claims and did not concede. Representatives from both sides had heated discussions on the geographical scope issue of the memorandum of understanding from the British Barrow representative, but no consensus was reached, and the negotiations were completely blocked. As a result of the Japanese delegation's deliberations on the 21st, they believed that the British side's attitude was tough and there was no other way for the meeting to end except in a breakdown. Therefore, the meeting was reopened from 6:30 p.m. and, after coordinating the aftermath, it was decided to telegraph the Osaka General Assembly to ask for instructions on what attitude should be taken if the British side still does not concede on the 28th. It is heard that the British side will also hold a meeting on the 26th to decide on its final attitude. However, the British side has no intention of changing its attitude, so it is generally expected that the Anglo-Japanese talks will take the meeting on the 28th as the final meeting. However, what attitude the two governments will take before the meeting breaks down is worth watching. (United News dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Efforts to Negotiate with Russia over Fishing Zone Disputes</p>
<p>The Key Issue in East Road Negotiations is the Exchange Rate</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota requested to speak at today's plenary session of the House of Representatives, stating the following:</p>
<p>Now that I hear that the plenary session of the House of Representatives is temporarily adjourned, I would like to report on the recent relations with the Soviet Union while the session is open. Regarding the issue of fishing zone bidding in Vladivostok on the 20th of this month, the government has been conducting various negotiations. The Soviet ambassador visited today and applied to correct the results of the previous bidding. This matter is expected to be resolved. As for the negotiations between Manchukuo and the Soviet Union on the East Road, they had stalled due to differences in the ruble exchange rate. Recently, the opinions of both sides have gradually converged on the issue of the exchange rate. I feel that there has been a turning point in these negotiations. In short, the policy towards the Soviet Union that I have adopted is to try to resolve the pending issues between the two countries separately, one by one. Under this policy, we will continue to work hard in the future. (United News dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the time of the Russian-controlled fishing zone bidding, the Japanese bid was declared invalid. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon telegraphed Ambassador Ota in Russia, instructing him to negotiate with the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet government's unilateral change of the ruble exchange rate was illegal and that the declaration of invalidity of the Japanese bid must be cancelled. At the same time, pending the report of Consul General Watanabe in Vladivostok, the fishing zones that the Japanese side should obtain will be negotiated again. According to Ambassador Ota's report, Counselor Sakako visited the acting director of the Far East Department of the Soviet government on the morning of the 20th and strongly protested about the fishing zone issue. The acting director of the Far East Department replied that the change in the ruble exchange rate must be coordinated by the Japanese and Soviet governments, and that this view was reasonable. The Soviet government will carefully study the matter and decide on countermeasures. Although the fishing zone bidding in Vladivostok was conducted by other official agencies, the central government will also consider solutions. Counselor Sakako also asked whether it was possible to telegraph local official agencies not to force Japan to change the ruble exchange rate. The acting director replied that he would wait for the report from Vladivostok. The results of the negotiations on that day were as such, and it can be seen that the Soviet government also recognizes the legitimacy of the Japanese claims. There is a glimmer of hope in this morning's negotiations. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the issue of the Russo-Japanese zone dispute, the number of people in both the government and the public in Japan who advocate taking this opportunity to revise the 1931 agreement is increasing day by day. It is said that during the negotiations in 1931 on the ruble exchange rate, the Russian side initially proposed that one ruble was worth 50 Japanese sen in gold, but after many twists and turns, it was finally set at 32.5 sen. Calculated at 32.5 sen, the fishing zone rental fee would also be more than 2 million yen. If it is changed to 75 sen, the rental fee would double to more than 4 million yen. The cost is too high, and it is inconvenient to take a dumping policy abroad, which is a matter of survival for the Japanese North Pacific fishing industry. There are two noteworthy points in the Russian side's strategy this time: one is that the Russian side helps various commercial countries to bid for the fishing zones at the highest price, and the other is that it changes the currency exchange rate, so that the Japanese side increases the burden and increases the cost, making it impossible to compete with Russian canned goods. The Russian side has used these legal means to make the Japanese side abandon the North Pacific fishing zone, which can be said to be a crisis for the Japanese fishing industry. Japanese officials and businessmen want to use this excuse to demand that Russia revise the treaty, which expires in 1936. It is difficult to predict whether the Russian side will allow the Japanese side's request before the expiration. (United Chinese Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>The Little Entente Countries are Deeply Wary</p>
<p>Budapest When Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich arrived here today, both the station and nearby buildings were adorned with the national flags of Italy and Hungary to express their welcome. Suvich gave a speech in Győr, in which he expressed his extreme happiness at his arrival, "but if my footsteps today were to fall on the undivided territory of Greater Hungary, then my joy would be even greater."</p>
<p>Italian Undersecretary Suvich met with Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kánya this evening, and then the Hungarian government invited Suvich to dinner. During the dinner, Gömbös gave a welcoming speech, saying that Hungary had a very good feeling for Italy and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and that the Italian Prime Minister's friendship towards Hungary was especially appreciated by the Hungarian people. Suvich replied that the Italian Prime Minister deeply understood the situation in Hungary, and the complexity and seriousness of the current international situation proved that the two countries had a close cooperation to seek economic and political restoration to normalcy. Suvich continued, "Italy is currently studying various major issues in order to achieve the peaceful transformation of the Danube region and Europe. The friendship between Italy and Hungary is a major factor in Italy's policy." (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Le Petit Parisien" commented on the visit of Italian Foreign Minister Suvich to Hungary, saying that Suvich's trip was not only to plan a meeting between the prime ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, but also to lay the foundation for an economic combination of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, and that Italy would guide it. This is not just the opinion of "Le Petit Parisien." The French press all hold this view. "Le Petit Parisien" also said that some say that this attempt is to help Austria so that Germany does not threaten its independence and economic resources, but Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia cannot but be wary when they hear of this plan. The newspaper also said, "Any movement to revise treaties and encourage Hungary to move in this direction, even if its intention is to free Hungary from Germany's restraint, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia will inevitably view this action with concern. Therefore, the only rational path is still the policy indicated by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, that is, to find ways for the small countries of Central Europe and the Balkans to cooperate economically. This kind of cooperation can be approved by major powers, but cannot be interfered with by them." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Budapest Today, when Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich arrived here, the newspapers in the Hungarian capital all expressed a warm welcome. For example, the government organ "Pesti Hírlap" stated that Italy and Hungary's peaceful policies are essentially one and the same, that these peaceful policies aim to reform the environment, but take a purely peaceful path, and that Suvich's visit here can be considered a part of this peaceful policy, because it can quickly resolve issues related to the Danube region. Furthermore, Austria has now cleared out the Socialist Party and is carrying out internal construction. Naturally, it does not want to join the negotiations between Italy and Hungary. The nationalist newspaper "Magyarság" stated that the close cooperation between Austria and Hungary for fourteen years has been unable to be realized due to the restrictions of the Little Entente, and that the restoration of the Danube region has become a pie in the sky. Now, only one person and only one country can re-establish the Danube region on bedrock. This one person and this one country is Mussolini and Italy. The liberal newspaper "Pesti Napló" said that Hungary has benefited a lot from Italy in the past, but Italy will never be disappointed. Now, the facts prove that this is not false, because Hungary is now devoted to Fascism and is not a follower of the Nordic ideal. (National News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Exchange of Views on Disarmament, Good Impression</p>
<p>Lord Eden Leaves Berlin for Rome</p>
<p>(Berlin) British Envoy Lord Eden, accompanied by British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Eric Phipps, visited German Foreign Minister Neurath this morning to continue yesterday's negotiations, which have now come to an end. (National News dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, German Chancellor Hitler, Foreign Minister Neurath, and Propaganda Minister Goebbels were invited by British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps and Lord Privy Seal Eden to lunch at the British Embassy. This was actually the first time Hitler had accepted an invitation as a guest to dine at a foreign embassy. After lunch, Hitler and the others stayed at the embassy and talked with Phipps and Eden for more than two hours. However, the actual exchange of views was conducted by the German Chancellor and the British disarmament expert. It is said that the British envoy's stay in Berlin this time was not for any "negotiations," but only to gather the latest views from all aspects of Germany related to Britain's recent disarmament memorandum in order to study whether any reconciliation methods can be established between Britain and Germany to reduce the causes of differences of opinion. Judging from the length of time that Hitler and Eden spent studying each other today and yesterday, and the good spirits of both sides after the meeting, it can be seen that both sides must have felt extremely satisfied with this conversation. The good impression that Hitler and Eden gave each other has become even more enhanced today, because both of them had served on the front lines in the European War, and they had a lot of fun mentioning the past during this meeting.

<h3 id="e35">Major Debate in the British House of Commons on the Austro-German Question <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Labor Party is Dissatisfied with the Current Situation in Austria</p>
<p>Expresses Dissent to the Three-Power Declaration</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons reopened the debate on the Austrian question. Labor Party Member of Parliament Wedgwood questioned why the governments of the three countries (Britain, France, and Italy) jointly issued a declaration protecting Austria's independence, saying that the current Austrian government's punishment of socialists was inhumane, and asked whether the British government had stated that it would not protect such a government, even if it did not cost a single blow. Foreign Secretary Simon immediately read out the original text of the Three-Power Declaration and said that this declaration was only announcing principles, and although it stated that Austria's independence needed to be maintained, it was limited to "according to the current treaty." Wedgwood also asked whether Britain could not make the Austrian government's prior restoration of democracy a condition for guaranteeing Austria's independence. The Foreign Secretary was unwilling to answer this question. Subsequently, other Labor Party members of parliament successively protested against Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss's domestic policy. The views of the British trade unionists on the current situation in Austria can be glimpsed from the speeches made by the parliamentarians. Some people also asked what decision Britain would make regarding Austria's plan to appeal directly to the League of Nations. Foreign Secretary Simon reiterated that, legally speaking, a government could not unilaterally make a decision on behalf of the League of Nations. Wedgwood also asked whether the British government had advised the Austrian government to be lenient, but the Austrian government recently took punitive actions, seemingly disregarding British advice, and whether the British attitude would be affected by this matter. Simon refused to answer this question. Finally, several Labor Party members of parliament said that Austria was becoming a pan-Germanic country and that workers did not have the right to organize. Such a country should not be given aid. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Belgian King's Funeral Held</p>
<p>The Procession Stretched Three Miles, Solemn and Reverent</p>
<p>Dignitaries from Various Nations Attended, Including the President of France as a Pallbearer</p>
<p>New King to Be Crowned Today; Republicans Will Seize the Opportunity to Demonstrate</p>
<p>Brussels – This morning, at dawn, a chilly breeze blew, and thick fog enveloped the city. Thousands of veterans slowly walked past the remains of the Belgian King, expressing their final respects to their late sovereign. The King's coffin, draped in the national flag and placed on a gun carriage, rested on the driveway of the Royal Palace. Although it was still early, mourners had already gathered in droves, as if the entire nation had come to pay their respects. Among the veterans were disabled soldiers. After they had marched past in formation, troops from the Allied Powers of the war followed. Then, the gun carriage moved, and the pallbearers reverently proceeded at a slow pace. At this time, the bells of the churches and the cannons of the military paid tribute in mourning. Apart from this, the city was as silent as a tomb. The gun carriage bearing the King's coffin slowly advanced through the troops. The Crown Prince and others closely followed behind. Then came dignitaries such as French President Lebrun, the British Crown Prince, the King of Bulgaria, the Queen of the Netherlands' consort, and the Danish Crown Prince. From the Royal Palace to the Saint Gudule Cathedral, the procession stretched three miles. Crowds of people lined both sides of the route, with every inch of space occupied. Windows, balconies, and even rooftops were packed. When the hearse arrived at the Saint Gudule Cathedral, its bells tolled solemnly. Military flags were arrayed at the entrance, and priests escorted the coffin into the church. The funeral service then began at 11:15 AM. The church was dimly lit, and the black curtains that were hung low added to the somber atmosphere. Soon after, the King's coffin was placed on the altar, with his ceremonial robes, helmet, and sword displayed beside it. Once everything was in place, the black round curtain was removed from above, and incense smoke filled the air, emanating from the censers suspended above the coffin. The Duke and Duchess of Brabant sat behind to the left and right. Archbishop Marie-Léonce conducted the solemn requiem mass and read the absolution. The crowds outside the church stood silently with their hats removed, listening to the service. After the service, the coffin was placed back on the hearse and transported through the heart of the city to the Church of Our Lady for the final benediction. Finally, the coffin was carried to the Royal Crypt at Laeken, where it was laid to rest amidst a 21-gun salute. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>Brussels – Today, as preparations for the Belgian King's funeral are nearing completion, rumors have suddenly spread that radical supporters of establishing a republic may stage a demonstration tomorrow when the Crown Prince is sworn in to succeed the throne. The authorities are now working hard to prevent any unforeseen events during the King's funeral and the new King's accession. The police are making every effort to protect the dignitaries from various countries who have come to attend the funeral and inauguration. Those who will be escorting the Belgian King's coffin to the Royal Crypt at Laeken include the King of Bulgaria, the King of Siam, the British Crown Prince, the Italian Crown Prince, the Norwegian Crown Prince, the Swedish Crown Prince, the Danish Crown Prince, and the Romanian Crown Prince. Across major European cities, mourning will be uniformly observed for the Belgian King's funeral. The British King and Queen will attend the memorial service at Westminster Abbey in London and the funeral service at Saint Gudule Cathedral in Brussels. At the same time, a service will also be held at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. The British Broadcasting Corporation will broadcast the service from Saint Gudule Cathedral at 11:00 AM this morning (Greenwich Mean Time, which is 7:00 PM Shanghai time). A British delegation is attending the funeral. The British Crown Prince arrived in Brussels yesterday on his private plane, escorted from Lympne by a squadron of Royal Air Force aircraft to the Belgian coast. Upon arriving in Brussels, he was welcomed at the airfield by Prince Charles, the second son of the Belgian King. Admiral Keyes, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet, and Viscount Alanbrooke arrived in Zeebrugge yesterday afternoon aboard the cruiser HMS Caradoc, escorted by the destroyer HMS Winchester. The ships carried fifty sailors and members of the Royal Marines band. The entire group traveled to Brussels by special train. The Royal Air Force has also dispatched seven officers and a hundred other ranks, along with the Fifth Dragoon Guards band, to attend the funeral. Representatives from many countries in Europe and beyond are participating. Simultaneously, the heads of state of ten countries around the world are either attending in person or sending representatives. When the doors of the Royal Palace were closed after the tributes concluded, thousands of citizens still stood reverently outside, hoping for a chance to pay their respects. The only conflict that occurred yesterday was when Flemish nationalist members of parliament walked out of the parliamentary hall when an official praised the Belgian King's achievements. They have now decided not to attend the Crown Prince's swearing-in ceremony tomorrow, because the oath is purely a Belgian affair, and the Prime Minister should not have praised the late Belgian King in the assembly using only French.

<h3 id="e105">The Truth About the Disturbances in Southern Xinjiang (Special Dispatch from Kashgar) <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Turkic Leaders Mutually Slaughtering Each Other</p>
<p>Thousands of Han Chinese Suffer Abuse</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's Attitude is Highly Suspicious</p>
<p>Eagerly Awaiting Decisive Action from the Central Government</p>
<p>The discovery of a puppet government in Kashgar, Southern Xinjiang, has been reported by various foreign news agencies. However, due to transportation obstacles, the truth is unknown. The following is a report from a gentleman who has resided in Kashgar for over twenty years, which is both detailed and accurate, and includes several attached photos, which will be published successively. The people of the country who care about the border territories should not ignore this.</p>
<p>Timur, the Turkic leader in Kashgar, was originally a trusted follower of Hoja Niyaz (who held out in Hami), the overall Turkic leader of Xinjiang. When he came to Kashgar with the Muslims, he was entrusted with the important mission of establishing a purely Turkic Eastern Turkestan state. However, he soon had the intention of dividing power with the Muslim leader Ma Zhancang and resolving the power of the Hui people (stationing Ma Zhancang in the Han city, i.e., Shule). However, because his strength was not sufficient and the Turkic people were a cowardly rabble, while the Muslims were all warlike and fearless and their weapons were sharp and bullets abundant, he brewed for many days but ultimately dared not trigger the opportunity. Communication between Kashgar and Shule was therefore not interrupted. Similarly, Imir Pasha, the leader of Hotan (Pasha means Turkic King), also harbored this idea, but dared not try it. As for Ma Zhancang's strength, although it exceeded theirs, he was only strong enough to defend one city, and not enough to attack other places. Thus, the Turkic and Hui people in the Kashgar and Hotan regions were divided into three forces, each unwilling to yield to the other. Later, Timur, with his ambition to establish an Eastern Turkestan state, secretly incited the general low-class and ignorant Arabs, Afghans, Andijanis (Russian subjects), and local bandits who stayed in Kashgar, as well as the Ahongs (Turkic religious leaders) and Maulanas (Turkic chanters) who had always been hostile to the Han people, to conspire and offer advice, saying that this was right and that was wrong, slandering each other, creating an extremely chaotic situation. However, one noteworthy event was the destruction of Han Chinese temples and the establishment of two model schools, with all the faculty and staff being Arabs and Andijanis. The curriculum was newly compiled, and the content was nothing more than "Destroy the Han and Revive the Turkic" and various fallacies such as "Strive forward and it will not be difficult to occupy all of China." According to reliable information, this rebellion by the Turkic and Hui people was purely the result of cunning schemes, and was not incited by the Han people. However, disputes soon arose within their party, dark tides erupted, and the struggle for power was extremely fierce. Thus, Ma Shaowu, who had previously been placed under house arrest by Timur in the Hui city (Shufu), took the opportunity to mobilize the bandit leader Usman to defect. At that time, Usman was the brigade commander under Timur and had long coveted the position of division commander, but Timur monopolized the positions of division commander and commander, so Usman harbored deep resentment towards Timur. Ma Shaowu also secretly agreed with Ma Zhancang in the Han city (Shule) to provide assistance. On August 9th, they lured and killed Timur outside the city of Shufu. Ma Shaowu immediately sank to the Han city that day. At this time, the Hui city was taken by Ma Zhancang. Ma Shaowu had information about taking the stage, but it was not realized. The Hui city was soon occupied by the fickle Usman and the remnants of Timur's forces (at that time, August 16th, it was a joint effort between the Turkic people inside and outside). At this time, Usman monopolized the positions of division commander and commander. However, Usman was originally a mountain bandit, and his ambition was to obtain more money and Han Chinese women. Therefore, regardless of the advantages and disadvantages, he repeatedly ordered his troops to besiege the Han Chinese city, but the Han Chinese city was able to preserve itself because of the Han Chinese's efforts to defend it. Unfortunately, Ma Zhancang was both brutal and did not receive enough extorted money, and hated the Han Chinese for not doing "Namaz" (the name of a Hui Muslim prayer), so he still often abused and killed Han Chinese. Some Han Chinese who feared disaster fled, but were often killed by the Turkic people. This is truly painful. However, communication between the two cities has been cut off since then and has not been restored to this day. Usman and Ma Zhancang's troops also separately extorted huge sums of money from wealthy merchants inside and outside the city. Their subordinates, in groups of three or five, went to the countryside to plunder people's property, and not a few villagers were hanged by them under false pretenses. As a result, panic arose in people's hearts, and those with wealth fled to India one after another. However, the Han Chinese were no different from rats in a hole, daring not risk their lives to escape, but only hiding to avoid being killed. Before long, Usman was overthrown by Setivaldiang (an Andijani). Setivaldiang was a cloth merchant in Kashgar. During Timur's time, he served as the head of the national regiment. His hatred of the Han Chinese was no less than that of Usman. After Usman was overthrown, he swept away more than a hundred boxes of property he had plundered from the Han Chinese (and thirty or forty kidnapped women) and fled into the mountains overnight. He was soon arrested and imprisoned in the camp by Setivaldiang. At this time, the Hui city had no leader. Setivaldiang took this opportunity to organize a puppet government, with Sa Wudi Da Maulana (from Atush, a town one station away from the Hui city, a place where Han Chinese were never allowed to trade) as the leader. The old military and political figures, with Setivaldiang having the greatest power, were able to remain in their positions, while all others were replaced. A ceremony was held inside and outside the city to hang the false new national flag. The false flag was green and modeled after the Turkish style, which was quite enthusiastic for a time, causing a commotion throughout the city. However, they were all ignorant people. Observing their rise and fall, they have plunged Southern Xinjiang (the general term for the southern route of Tianshan) into a state of anarchy for more than seven months. The thousands of Han Chinese refugees who were not completely killed by the Turkic and Hui people are now groaning and waiting to be rescued from the fire pit. What is even more strange is that during this long period of turmoil, there has been no news of any measures taken by the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and not even a bit of information can be obtained, as if they had turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. I don't know what their intentions are. However, the Turkic newspapers recorded that Liu and Sheng of the provincial government had transferred Southern Xinjiang (Yanqi, Aksu, Kashgar, and Khotan four districts) to Hoja Niyaz to govern. This news came suddenly and was extremely frightening. However, there must be a reason for it. According to reliable sources, Hoja Niyaz is now in Aksu negotiating with Soviet Russia for a large amount of military supplies, such as airplanes and fast guns, in exchange for wool, which is transported by the Kazi of Ushi (a county name, one station away from Aksu, connected to the Russian-owned Hala Lake). At the same time, the puppet government in Kashgar is also sending Arabs with huge sums of money to India to buy airplanes, and Imir Pasha of Hotan is also exchanging Hotan silk with Afghanistan for armaments. What do they want to do by preparing so eagerly? This is worth noting. Furthermore, Soviet Russia, disregarding international friendship, is providing them with military supplies. What is its intention? This is even more worthy of study. The central government urgently needs to quickly find a way to deal with the situation. In general, this kind of turmoil cannot be quelled without the use of force by the central government, and the sooner the better. If they hesitate again, the thousands of miles of fertile land will surely become a detached territory, and the thousands of Han Chinese refugees with no way out will be forever trapped in the fire pit. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the central government will adopt decisive measures, without further considering everything, and quickly send a large number of elite troops into Xinjiang to quell the rebellion. As for the road to Xinjiang, if it is impossible to negotiate with Soviet Russia, then the Dunhuang small road can also be used to copy to Hotan (it can arrive in 23-24 days, but there is a shortage of water), or you can take a long-distance bus from Guihua to Guchengzi (Qitai county name, six stations away from Dihua, it only takes six or seven days by bus), both are possible. As long as the central army arrives, the lost land can be expected to be recovered. If it is delayed any longer, it will give them the opportunity to collude with other countries, creating a more complex and difficult to resolve situation, and the same mistakes as the four northeastern provinces will surely be repeated.

<h3 id="e106">General Situation of Hululu Wang Territory (Continued) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>(1) Report from Cheng Fu Xing Regarding the Investigation of Mining Affairs</p>
<p>Respectfully submitting for your consideration: I, your humble servant, was ordered to investigate the mining affairs of Ban Hong, to announce the government's benevolent intentions, and to invite the Tusi chiefs to the provincial capital for discussions. Following this order, I departed from the provincial capital on January 10th of the 22nd year [of the Republic] and arrived at Mengning County City on February 2nd. I delayed for several days to prepare everything necessary for the journey and to invite local gentry familiar with the area to serve as advisors. On February 14th, I set off from Mengning. The journey to Gengma, being within our territory, was relatively easy and has already been reported. However, the route from Gengma through Mengyi to the Hululu Wang territory, though not long in distance, is inhabited by various ethnic groups with whom communication is difficult. The roads are treacherous and arduous, beyond description. Moreover, the areas along the way have, since ancient times, practiced the barbaric custom of taking human heads as sacrifices for good harvests. During the second or third and seventh or eighth months of the lunar calendar, the local people are more ferocious than usual, everyone carrying sharp long knives, honed like snow, never letting them out of their grasp, wielding them at the slightest provocation as if it were commonplace. Even Han Chinese merchants who normally trade in the area dare not travel during this period. When I arrived at Gengma, it was precisely the time of the Lang Umbrella headhunting season. The Tusi chiefs were terrified, as if they had seen a tiger, fearing that I would not return, and repeatedly tried to dissuade me. However, considering the importance of this matter to the entire financial lifeline of Yunnan and the great expectations of the government, I had no reason to retreat in the face of difficulty. Therefore, I summoned my courage and embarked on this exploratory journey. The accompanying gentry, such as Li Guiting, Li Fengting, and Qiu Daru from Mengning, and Wang Qidong from Shuangjiang, were all men of great courage and determination, willing to take risks to fulfill the mission and repay the government. The Tusi chiefs were greatly impressed. Han Fuguo, the Tusi chief of Gengma, seeing my determination to proceed, sent two soldiers and a squad leader to escort me, and also sent a letter written with burnt offerings to Hu Yushan, the Ban Hong Wang, to facilitate the investigation of mining affairs. I then proceeded directly to Mengdong Jiao. There, the Tusi chief Han Huaxiang also tried to intimidate me with the dangers ahead and tried to stop me from proceeding. The officers and soldiers sent by Gengma were also apprehensive. Fortunately, the Mengning and Shuangjiang gentry, Li, Qiu, Peng, and others, were deeply familiar with the border situation and had long been eager to assist the government in managing the frontier. They encouraged each other with the saying, "How can you catch a tiger cub without entering the tiger's den?" and volunteered to be the vanguard, which helped maintain stability. Seeing my fearlessness, Han Huaxiang also sent a relative to lead several men to accompany me, and also wrote a letter to the Ban Hong Wang. At this time, not only were the Kawa tribesmen rampant, but the Yellow bandits led by Fa Qing were also actively causing trouble, disturbing the borders of Ban Hong. As soon as I entered the territory, I received a letter from the Ban Hong Wang, saying that the Yellow bandits led by Fa Qing were attacking him, that all places were heavily guarded, and that he feared misunderstandings and requested that I not proceed. When I arrived at Ban Hong, they refused to open the寨gate. I then asked the Mengdong 新 Lord who accompanied me to reply with a letter, saying that I was the same Commissioner Li who had come before, sent by the government, traveling thousands of miles, and sent my seal and official documents, and also sent generous gifts. Seeing the seal and official documents, the Wang no longer refused and opened the gate to let me in. This was on February 20th. In total, excluding delays along the way, there were 21 stations from the province to Mengning, 2 stations from Mengning to Shuangjiang, 2 stations from Shuangjiang to Gengma, 2 stations to Mengjiao Dong, and 2 stations from Mengjiao Dong to Ban Hong, for a total of 29 stations. This is the journey from the province to Ban Hong. Upon arriving at Ban Hong, I first announced the government's benevolent intentions and distributed gifts. Then, I discussed with the Ban Wang the government's intention to open a mining factory in the area. The Ban Wang said, "I am originally a subject of the Great Qing Dynasty, and I have always obeyed the Great Qing government. It is acceptable to open this factory, but this factory does not belong to me alone. Besides Ban Hong, there are also Ban Lao Mine, Bie Yong, Banshao, and Xin Si Wang. It would be appropriate to proceed according to the precedents set by Wu Shangxian in ancient times." I then asked what those precedents were. The Ban Wang said, "The government must first notify all the Wangs, explaining the reasons for opening the factory. After the Wangs agree, the government must give dozens of sets of clothes, silver knives, saddles, and horses to the Wangs and headmen. They should all be invited to Ban Lao to gather, slaughter dozens of cattle, entertain the Wangs and headmen, and sign a contract. Only then can the factory be opened without obstacles. This is what was done effectively in the past." I then asked him to send someone to guide me to the mining area so that I could conduct an on-site inspection. The Ban Wang said that it was still difficult to do so because he had not yet communicated the reasons for the investigation to the Wangs, nor had he sent gifts to them to gain their favor. Going there rashly would be dangerous. I found the Wang's words to be honest and considerate. Although the Ban Wang had not read Han Chinese books, he spoke fluent Chinese and greatly admired Zhuge Wuhou (a pair of Kongming bronze drums still exists in Bang Nong). He was familiar with 茿 script and could recite Sanskrit scriptures, truly a wise and capable man. Although I knew that the Wang's words were sincere, there was no reason to return empty-handed after entering a mountain of treasure. Moreover, having been ordered to investigate, it would be a dereliction of duty not to conduct an on-site inspection of the mine. I still did not take a large retinue, but only accompanied the gentry from Mengning and Shuangjiang, Li, Qiu, Peng, and others, along with the Ban Hong Wang's son and a few attendants, totaling about a dozen people, traveling in disguise to dispel the suspicions of the Wangs. The journey from Ban Hong to the mine was over towering mountains, with steep cliffs and dense forests, rarely trod by human feet. We climbed vines and creepers, crossing dangerous cliffs and precipices, enduring all kinds of hardships before reaching the mine entrances. There were dozens of entrances, some tens of丈 deep and others more than ten丈. We inspected each entrance. The entrances were covered with bat droppings. The bats were almost as large as orioles. There was the sound of flowing water inside, with stone benches and stone bridges. When illuminated by electric light, the ore sparkled and shone brightly. The traces of prosperous management in the past were obvious, truly a sight to behold. Eventually, the sun was setting, and there was no place to stay. It was impossible to delay any longer, so we selected ore from the cave to be taken back in three categories for testing. The mountain area is about 9,230 square li or more, spanning the territories of five Wangs. Furthermore, the climate is mild, without mountain fog and瘴poison. No wonder it is famous throughout the world. After leaving the cave, we took photographs across the river. Along the road, we saw a　　going through, its trunk was great, in camp Hululu Wang land　mountain shape map</p>
<p>Making a foot seven feet or more, then photographed its image, to see a class of barbaric peoples, returned to Ban Hong, passed through Nan Village and consulted with the heads, first made a contract, so that this hard work, not to no avail, each head all agreed, then arrived at Ban Hong, then the king has invited the representatives of the kings, came before me etc., Under the interview, they all claimed that the Han Dynasty must come to start the business before it can be done, otherwise, we must unite the kings to do our best to resist, and never give up easily, and we must follow the precedents of Wu Shangxian in the past, etc., and the partners took out the government's official documents and seals, and then each agreed to obey, and they were willing to make a contract with the job first, as the basis for future investigative committees, and their intentions were extremely sincere, and it was difficult to refuse their request, so they established the future investigation, and made a contract, Gai Yi sexual many doubts, if it is not so, it is not enough to strengthen his faith in the heart of the government. The representatives of the kings are not easy to gather, and the Han Dynasty must come to open the office, and if it is not the Han Dynasty, they must do their best to resist, and they want it to be like this, and now they get it unintentionally, what a joy, this is the real situation of arriving at Ban Hong, personally visiting the mine, conducting field investigations, and discussing methods with each representative (below omitted). A rough diagram of the shape of the ore mountain is shown above.</p>
<p>(2) Memorandum Outlining Preparatory Measures for Developing the Hululu Wang Territory Silver Mine</p>
<p>Respectfully submitting for your consideration and instructions: I, your humble servant, have investigated the Hululu Wang territory silver mine and have already submitted a detailed report on the process for your consideration. Furthermore, I received instructions from the Governor to devise measures for commencing development. I have investigated the production quantity and quality of the Hululu Wang territory silver mine. Past history and various investigations can prove that its reputation has long been established, and there is no need for me to repeat it. However, the current opening, how to raise funds to set up factories, how to mine, refine, transport, and sell, are all technical problems. It requires individuals with mining knowledge and good planning skills to personally visit the site and work practically to avoid the drawbacks of building a cart behind closed doors and cutting one's toes to fit the shoes. Therefore, for the sake of seeking truth from facts, I propose to start with a preparatory committee. On the one hand, it should enlist the support of the three Tusi chiefs of Gengma, Mengdian, and Mengdong Jiao, as well as the five Wangs of Ban Hong, so that they have a high degree of trust in our government, so as to eliminate actual obstacles. On the other hand, it should enlist talented individuals with border affairs aspirations, mining knowledge, and interests, so that they have opportunities to contact the local people of the Hululu Wang territory, so as to investigate and design. For this reason, I propose that the province commission several specialists, who I will guide to the Hululu Wang territory, to act as a preparatory committee, to liaise with the Tusi chiefs and to plan and implement on site. If success is foreseeable and there is certainty, then organize a Hululu Wang Territory Mining Affairs Committee to formally commence development. After careful consideration, I have drafted preparatory work steps and the organizational charter of the Ban Hong Mining Affairs Committee, each in one copy. I hereby respectfully submit this document to the Governor for your consideration. Would it be possible to select specialists and issue preparatory funds to be guided by me to the Hululu Wang territory for on-site planning and implementation? I humbly request your approval and instructions. Respectfully submitted by Li, Director of the Fudian New Bank, and Li Jingsen, investigator of the Hululu Wang territory mining affairs.</p>
<p>(3) Outline of Preparations for Developing the Hululu Wang Territory Silver Mine</p>
<p>(1) Request for the appointment of preparatory personnel: 1. Two factory affairs preparatory committee members, who must have mining and metallurgy knowledge, are responsible for surveying the mining area, testing the ore quality, and designing mining and refining matters. 2. Two administrative committee members, who must be familiar with the border situation and have talented scholars, plan all mining matters and are responsible for communicating government intentions, liaising with Tusi chiefs and headmen, and investigating the political, economic, racial, religious, language, and other living conditions of the factory site. 3. Eight preparatory committee members are proposed to be commissioned to the three Tusi chiefs of Gengma, Mengdian, and Mengdong Jiao, as well as the five Wangs of Ban Hong, in order to facilitate liaison and promote progress.</p>
<p>(2) Determine the mining area: 1. After arriving in the Hululu Wang territory, immediately survey the mines and test the ore quality. 2. If the ore quality is excellent and there is a possibility of trial operation, select the most prosperous vein with the best components as the factory site. 3. At the same time, investigate the culture and living conditions.</p>
<p>(3) Trial factory establishment: 1. Build ten simple houses, each requiring about 200 yuan in cash, for a total of 2,000 yuan in cash. 2. Install five old-style furnaces, each requiring about 500 yuan in cash, for a total of 2,500 yuan. 3. Temporarily employ 50 sand workers, hired from neighboring counties, each ten workers supplying one furnace, each person earning 70 cents in silver cash per day, totaling 35 yuan per day and 1,050 yuan per month. 4. Purchase 50 sets of mining tools and explosives (one axe, one hoe, one hammer, roughly like sappers), each set costing about 10 yuan in cash, for a total tool cost of 500 yuan in cash. The explosives purchase requires 200 yuan in cash, and ten cannons need 100 yuan in cash, for a total of 800 yuan in cash. 5. Hire technicians, one person for each furnace, for a total of three people, with a monthly salary estimated at 50 yuan in cash, for a total of 150 yuan in cash. 6. Open a charcoal factory, which can be opened in the mountains near the mine, about 20 to 30 li away, requiring 5,000 jin of charcoal to be burned daily, costing about 100 yuan in cash, or 3,000 yuan per month. 7. Organize provisions, which are purchased and transported from the lands of the three Tusi chiefs of Gengma, Mengdian, and Mengdong Jiao, requiring about 100 jin of rice per day, estimated at 13 yuan in cash for 100 people, or about 500 yuan per month, for a total of 1,000 yuan. 8. Organize ten transport animals, camels and mules, each costing 200 yuan in cash, for a total cost of 2,000 yuan (temporary hires are not included). 9. Estimate the cost of trial factory establishment to be over 12,000 yuan, with regular expenses of about 5,000 yuan. It is expected that a monthly income of four hands of silver bars will result in a surplus.</p>
<p>(4) Promote the Mining Affairs Committee: 1. When the trial factory is decided to be established, the administrative committee members must formally organize the administrative office, handle reporting, publicity, application for funds, and distribution of uses. 2. After one month of operation, report the factory conditions and output to the province for verification. If it is considered that it can be continued, try again for one month, and then formally establish a Mining Affairs Committee in accordance with the organizational charter, and establish a factory police team for protection. At this point, the preparatory work is completed, and the government formally appoints the mining affairs committee members and managers, responsible for planning improvements, and determining supervisory regulations to guide them.</p>
<p>(5) Preparations for departure: 1. Purchase chemical reagents for testing and local mining equipment. 2. Purchase gifts for慰慰 the Tusi chiefs and Tusi kings. 3. Create survey forms and all stationery. 4. Request the preparatory and travel expenses.</p>
<p>(Addendum) The slag from the smelting of ore by Wu Shangxian in the past is piled up like mountains in dozens of places. The old silver factory near Ban Hong, Myanmar, due to the exhaustion of raw materials in recent years, the manager of the factory, Wu Bolan, has purchased this tribute ore slag from the Bang Nong tenant officials at any time and transported it to Mengyao. Excluding hired porters, each 100 jin is settled at a price of 10 English Yang. Now, if we independently operate the raw ore, we can contact the old silver factory and sell this ore slag. The profit can be used as the regular expenses of the factory each year.</p>

<p>Prisoner Escapes</p>
<p>Chen Laosan, a thief who robbed a large sum of public funds and public property from the county's Public Funds and Property Management Office eighteen years ago, was captured and sentenced to eight years in prison. While imprisoned, Chen was typically very free, often going out for游 without any restrictions. The afternoon before yesterday, at 1:00 PM, the prisoner claimed to be ill and went to the hospital for treatment. By evening, the warden noticed that Chen had not returned to prison and became anxious, immediately reporting to the county government. The city gates were closed tightly, and a house-to-house search was conducted, but the results were nil.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Province Touring Station Decided to be Located on Tiger Hill in Suzhou</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched　the Southeast Transportation Touring Exhibition, scheduled to begin on June 15th, lasting 20 days. Participants included five provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi. Each province selected a key transportation hub to establish a exhibition site, serving as a touring station, displaying products and transportation equipment along the highways. Besides Zhejiang, which was set up at Mount Tianmu and Mount Yandang, and Jiangxi, which was set up at Mount Longhu, the locations for Fujian and Anhui had not been determined. Jiangsu Province, however, was designated as a key transportation route due to its rich products and beautiful scenery, so the touring station was decided to be located on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. The county government has been ordered to rush to complete the Su-Chang Road so that the highways of the five provinces can connect to Fujian and Jiangxi via the Xi-Chang, Xi-Hu, Xi-Yi, and Jing-Wu roads. On one side, from Suzhou Su-Jia road reaches Hangzhou, and then Shanghai from Hu-Hang road, will be connected before the exhibition, unobstructed. County Magistrate Zou is also planning to rebuild Tiger Hill Road to enhance the views.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Investigation of the Xu-Ge Lawsuit Begins <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yunxiu, the former Chinese secretary of Soochow University, has recently been sued by Ge, a woman from Changshu, to the Wuxian District Court for abandonment. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Prosecutor Du Jiasheng of the District Prosecutor's Office opened a court hearing. The defendant, Xu Yunxiu, as well as Xu's second wife, Zhang Guizhen, and Xu Enqi, were not present due to other matters. The plaintiff, Ge, had arrived in Suzhou from her old residence in Changshu to await the hearing. Witnesses Ge Kunxiang (who served as the媒for Ge's marriage to Xu), Xu Shao (Ge's sister-in-law), and clansmen Xu Qian, Xu Qunlian, and others, as well as the plaintiff's lawyer, Liu Zuwang, were also summoned. The hearing lasted for three hours. Ge stated the suffering of being abandoned by Yunxiu for forty years, and that her son, Xu Enqi, who is now a professor at Soochow University, also did not fulfill his obligation to support her, and requested that the court punish him with the due punishment. Xu Yunxiu claimed that he had divorced Ge long ago, severing the relationship between husband and wife, and therefore could not be considered abandonment. Witnesses Xu Qian, Xu Shao, and Ge Kunxiang, among others, testified that Ge and Yunxiu had not divorced. Xu Junkang testified that they had divorced. After the questioning, both the plaintiff and the defendant were dismissed and asked to await a scheduled rehearing.</p>

<p>Labor Dispute at Qingfeng Textile Mill</p>
<p>The Qingfeng Textile Mill in Zhoushan浜, Wuxi, has been in operation for over ten years. The factory stopped on December 27th of the old lunar year and was originally scheduled to resume work on the seventh day of the first lunar month. However, the factory intends to reform the management aspect from this year onwards, replacing male workers in the steel wire machine section with female workers. The First Factory workshop originally had more than sixty male workers, who were all dismissed by Factory Director Tang at the end of the old year. Before yesterday was the start of reopening, dismissed workers, believing that they would be unemployed and have difficulty making a living, held incense sticks and went to the factory, requesting the board of directors and supervisors of the factory union office to serve as mediators. However, they were rejected by the factory and not allowed to enter, leading to a riot. Workers in the steel wire department went on strike. Fearing that the matter would escalate, the factory immediately reported to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau and the county police patrol team, which dispatched teams to the site to suppress the situation. The workers were helpless and dispersed. That night, over two thousand workers at the old factory went on strike en masse. However, the dismissed workers were unwilling to give up and proposed nine conditions to cope with the situation: 1. Reinstate the two workers who were dismissed without cause (those dismissed after December 28th of the old lunar year). 2. Piecework wages must be paid on time and not withheld. 3. Reinstate the night meal allowance. 4. Wages should be paid monthly as before and not changed to daily pay. 5. Reinstate the worship salary: machine workers and female workers are paid full wages for the first week. 6. Restore the reduced wages. 7. Improve treatment, extend meal times, remove cold water for rinsing rice, the leather rod room still belongs to the old factory, machine workers have freedom to eat, and restore stools. Factory Director Tang must not arbitrarily beat people in the future. 8. Re-employ Ding Qian, the former chief manager, and reject engineer Li Xin. 9. All of the above eight articles must be accepted by the factory before work can resume. The workers petitioned the county party headquarters on one hand and went to the Textile Union on the other, requesting mediation. Yesterday (the 22nd), the union held an emergency meeting to discuss mediation methods. As a result, a representative was selected to petition the county government. After arriving at the county, County Magistrate Yan came out to meet them and instructed the representatives to persuade the workers to resume work first. In the afternoon, more workers went to the county party headquarters to petition first, and then went to the county government to petition. County Magistrate Yan met with the representatives and instructed the striking workers to resume work first. All sixty dismissed people will quietly wait for the party and government agencies to discuss a resolution. The six representatives were satisfied and agreed to inform the workers to resume work this morning (the 23rd) and await the resolution today.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Shanghai Banking Community Cables US in Opposition to Raising Silver Prices <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Also Requests the Ministry of Finance to Temporarily Suspend Approval of the Silver Agreement</p>
<p>Because Raising Silver Prices in the US Provides No Benefit to China</p>
<p>Recently, the US government, with the aim of raising silver prices, will be re-minting silver coins and has submitted it to the Senate for discussion. After this news was spread, the Chinese banking community believes that if this measure is implemented, China, as an import surplus country and a silver standard country, will inevitably suffer unimaginable consequences. Therefore, on the 20th of this month, in the name of the Shanghai Banking Association, representing all banks in Shanghai, a cable was sent to US President Roosevelt to express their views. At the same time, a cable was also sent to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the temporary suspension of the Silver Agreement produced at the World Economic Conference in order to cope with foreign currency aggression. However, within the banking community, due to the importance of this matter, strict secrecy was maintained to the outside world. After detailed investigation by a reporter from the East China News Agency, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Cable to the US President Expressing Opposition <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Key figures in the banking community in this city believe that the US government's increase in silver prices will inevitably cause a large outflow of silver from China. After closely exchanging views, on the 20th of this month, in the name of the Shanghai Banking Association, representing all banks in Shanghai, a cable was sent to US President Roosevelt, requesting careful consideration. The original text was advisory in nature and not a protest. The wording did not explicitly oppose this policy of the US government, but in effect, it stated that the Chinese banking community, once this measure is implemented, expresses its utmost regret. According to a report from a reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency, the content of the cable was roughly as follows: (1) Explain China's current situation and economic conditions. (2) Based on China's current economic situation, the Chinese financial and business community will suffer serious losses as a result of the implementation of the US silver policy. (3) The sudden and high increase in silver prices in the US will cause irreparable chaos in China's international exchange rates. (4) It is hoped that the US government will implement the silver policy by gradually increasing silver prices, instead of taking sudden increases, in order to reduce the disorder of China's silver market. The above points are hoped to be noted by the US. After the cable was sent, according to news obtained by the banking community in this city, it is said that Roosevelt has agreed to consider it. However, he is currently unable to immediately indicate whether it is feasible.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Cable to the Ministry of Finance Requesting Delay of Approval of the Agreement <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The banking community also sent a cable to Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance in Nanjing, on the same day, requesting a temporary suspension of the Silver Agreement produced at the World Economic Conference. This is because, at a time when the US government authorities are actively trying to increase silver prices, judging by their actions, it is inevitable. Although the banking community has sent a cable to the US President to state everything, there are fears that the effect will be minimal. At this time, the Silver Agreement is being sent to governments of various countries for approval. Once our government hastily approves it, it will be bound by this agreement for future silver issues and will not be able to operate freely. Therefore, it is specifically requested that the Ministry of Finance temporarily suspend approval of this agreement before the US government's silver price increase policy is fully understood.</p>

<p>According to the Bank of China's report yesterday, the amount of silver stored in this city is not large. According to yesterday's statistics, there are a total of 14,248,000 taels of silver, 33,678,000 yuan in silver dollars, and 15,819 large bars. Our country is a silver standard country, and most of the silver is concentrated in Shanghai. This report can prove the general situation of silver reserves in our country. According to Mr. Bei Songsun, in the past, silver mostly flowed into our country, but recently it is not the case. In 1929, the silver flowing into our country still reached tens of millions of ounces. However, based on last year's situation, the silver flowing from our country to foreign countries reached more than 50 million. Upon investigation, the cause of this trend is, of course, the alarming trade deficit, but the increase in overseas silver prices is also a factor. Now that the United States has raised silver prices, it is said that trade with China will increase compared to the past, which is very beneficial to China. However, this is just one side of the story from the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Raising Silver Prices is Not Beneficial to Us <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The banking community in our country stated that the rise in silver prices is a natural result of the rise in commodity prices, so this trend has no impact on society and international relations. Now, looking at the U.S. policy of raising silver prices, it only focuses on raising silver prices. This kind of expansionary policy is indeed beneficial to its dumping in China, but our country's goods will be affected by this and cannot be sold abroad. This situation will cause all the silver in our country to flow out, and what remains in the country will only be goods. The result will inevitably plunge our country's economic situation into a state of non-circulation and extreme chaos. If our country were a surplus country, the rise in silver prices would have no impact on us. But now it is not the case. The dumping of foreign goods year after year is becoming more and more intense. Even based on what was released yesterday by the International Trade Bureau, the trade deficit in January of this year has reached more than 40 million. Judging from this kind of statistics, it is even more clear that the increase in silver prices is harmful and not beneficial to us.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The North China Daily News Reports Luo Youfu's Telegram <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News said that several Chinese bankers in this city telegraphed President Roosevelt, clearly stating that artificially raising the value of silver is not beneficial but harmful to China. It is heard that President Luo soon replied by telegram, saying that he would consider their opinions. The telegram was sent by a small group of bankers in a private capacity, so the text of the telegram was not made public. Zhang Gongquan, President of the Bank of China, Li Ming of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Bei Songsun, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, are all listed in the telegram. In addition, there are two other people. According to recent research, banker Mr. Xu once criticized the United States' wait-and-see attitude towards the use of silver as currency. The telegram sent this time is based on this idea, using clear words to oppose this kind of delaying attitude, and artificially raising the price of silver. The telegram stated that those who advocate this measure believe that it will be beneficial to China. It should be known that China is a country with a trade deficit, and artificially raising the price of silver will greatly hit China's welfare. It is heard that the central government is now closely watching the development of the U.S. silver problem. If the U.S. government decides to artificially raise the price of silver, the financial community in this city will implement corresponding remedial plans. However, when someone inquired about this matter from the authorities of the Ministry of Finance, they all remained silent. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance quite advocates the stability of silver prices. In the past two days, there have been rumors at home and abroad that the government is discussing suppressing the value of the national currency or prohibiting the export of silver, but according to a reliable telegram from Nanjing, the authorities have denied it.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Bei and Lin Express Their Opinions <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the China East News Agency visited Mr. Bei Songsun, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, and Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, yesterday. According to Mr. Bei, the telegram to President Roosevelt, which was published in the North China Daily News, was sent by several of them in a private capacity, which is not accurate. Currently, Mr. Roosevelt has not yet replied to this. Regarding the U.S. government's policy of raising silver prices, some say that our country is a silver standard country, and that our purchasing power can be increased in the future, so it is considered beneficial. Some say that it will cause a large outflow of silver from our country, creating an economic panic. The latter observation is more thorough than the former. However, how will our country deal with this in the future? From a personal perspective, we still need to pay attention to the U.S. government's true attitude towards raising silver prices before we can determine anything. As for the saying that the export of silver should be prohibited, it can also be implemented when necessary, but there is no need for it at this time. According to Mr. Lin, in his personal opinion, this move by the U.S. government has a great impact on our country. In the past, the silver agreement concluded at the World Economic Conference is now being approved by the governments of various countries. In my opinion, implementation measures should be stipulated in the silver agreement, which may reduce international concerns about the silver problem. As for the prohibition of silver exports, this is indeed one of the methods, but the government authorities must also be fully prepared in advance to avoid difficulties. As for the telegram sent by the Banking Association to President Roosevelt, and the request to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi on the same day to postpone the approval of the silver agreement, no reply has been received. As for the original text of the two telegrams, it is not yet possible to publish them due to their importance.</p>
<h3 id="e122">International Telegraph Office Conducts Trial Talk with England Last Night <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Results Are Quite Good and Trials Will Continue</p>
<p>Ownership of the Radio Station Has Been Accepted</p>
<p>After the Sino-British telecommunications began, the Ministry of Communications ordered the International Telegraph Office to prepare to hold mutual wireless telephone calls with European countries. It had held several trial talks with Britain and Germany. Last night, the office held another trial talk with England, and the results were quite good. The office is now preparing to implement long-term trial talks, scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays each week as the trial talk period. This trial talk is limited to within a few months, and when it is completely successful, it can be officially started. A reporter from the China East News Agency specially inquired about the trial talk situation yesterday, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e123">Trial Talk Last Night <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Last night, the International Telegraph Office's sending and receiving department took advantage of the radio station to hold a trial talk with London, England. Here, the staff of the sending and receiving department were responsible, while the other party was the person in charge of the transportation agency under the jurisdiction of the highest postal and telecommunications authority in the United Kingdom. The two sides tested the sound for a long time, and the results were quite good.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Trial Period Specified <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The International Telegraph Office has recently re-specified that this trial talk will be held every Tuesday and Thursday. The trial talk time is not fixed, because it can only be implemented after the radio station is free. According to the office, in order to be cautious, it is planned to hold long-term trial talks with European countries, with a period of several months. Currently, Britain and Germany have already achieved results in trial talks. After success, trial talks will be held one by one with the United States, France, Italy, and other countries.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Acceptance of Radio Station <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>In addition, the Sino-British radio stations for Sino-British telecommunications, which were recently held by the office, were all installed by the British Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. Although the calls are now connected, the ownership and management rights of the radio station are still in the hands of the Marconi Company. The day before yesterday, the Ministry of Communications specially hired Zhu Qiqing, a commissioner from the National Defense Committee, to go to Shanghai to meet with Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telegraph Office, engineers Zhang Chenghu, Shen Shuren, and technician Niu Yinliang, to accept the radio station project. They also held trials for the past two days and found that there were no drawbacks in the machinery. It is planned to report the trial process to the Ministry of Communications within a few days, and then the Ministry will pay the final payment to Marconi.</p>

<p>Thirty-four disabled officers and soldiers of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army from the Northeast, led by Wang Zhenqiu and others, came to Shanghai to appeal to all walks of life for donations to provide pensions for their future lives. Wang and others are currently staying at the Beizhan Railway Hotel. The reporter went to investigate yesterday and found that the situation was extremely embarrassing. According to Mr. Wang, they were scattered in various rear wounded soldier hospitals in Beiping. Recently, the Beiping Military Affairs Committee issued an order to dismiss them and return them to their hometowns, but most of them belong to the Northeast and have no home to return to. How can they continue their lives after this? They have been disabled for the country, and they should ask fellow countrymen and charitable organizations to find ways to maintain them, etc.</p>

<p>Upstream and Downstream Ships from Today</p>
<p>Can Load Cargo and Pass Unimpeded</p>
<p>Since January 15 this year, the water level of the Yangtze River has been receding both upstream and downstream. Upstream, the Xindi had only five feet, blocking Jianglun for more than a month, and more than 30 ships were stranded and transshipped. Downstream of the Yangtze River, the water level at Madang first fell, and then Wuhu receded. At the shallowest time, it was only seven feet two inches, which is rare in the past 30 years. The grounding and blockage of upstream and downstream Jianglun, as well as the transshipment halfway, lasted for more than a month, with a total of about forty or fifty ships. The commercial and shipping industries suffered huge losses. It was not until yesterday that the wheel companies in this city received telegrams from Shashi Hankou stating that the water at Xindi had risen by two feet, and now reached seven feet. Shallow water Jianglun can be used for passage without having to be towed. Downstream, from Hankou to Jiujiang, the water is nine feet two inches, and from Jiujiang to Wuhu, it has risen to ten feet five inches. Yangtze River ships can load 50% of their cargo and are expected to pass without having to be transshipped. The ships that were grounded during the shallow water have all sailed out. From today, upstream and downstream wheels of the Yangtze River can come and go freely.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Sichuan River Wheel Alliance Increases Fees <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Causing Sichuan Gang to Suspend the Handling of Goods</p>
<p>Increase of 100 Percent</p>
<p>Most of the Customs Brokers Disputed</p>
<p>The Sichuan River Wheel, the alliance cooperation, and the increase in the cost of water have been recorded in this newspaper. In recent days, the wheel company is still in a meeting on the issue of the size and weight of the grocery transport, and the Sichuan Gang Hakka, for this price increase, it is not possible to oppose it, but there are quite different opinions on the reform of the weight, etc. Yesterday, the Hakkas have telegraphed to Chongqing, please stop handling goods, in order to resist, the reporter will re-state the situation obtained from all aspects as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e134">New Rate Implemented <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>After the Taigu Yihua Minsheng Jiejang and others agreed on the Sichuan River Wheel Alliance and increased the cost of water, from yesterday, each wheel company has notified the customs brokers and the Hakkas to implement the new cost of water. Shanghai cotton yarn is transported to Chongqing, each piece increased from twelve yuan to twenty-two yuan, that is, from the Minheng wheel of Minsheng and the Gongping wheel of Jiejang to load export goods. The two wheels will go to Sichuan from Shanghai in the next two days, which is the first upstream ship after the Sichuan River Wheel Alliance and the increase in fees.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Second Price Increase <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>At the Jiejang meeting, the wheel companies originally agreed that after changing the two to yuan, even if the cotton yarn rose to 22 yuan, it would only be a little more than 15 taels. At a time when various consumption items in the shipping industry are increasing wildly, it is still impossible to make a profit. Therefore, after public discussion among the representatives of the companies, it is necessary to increase the Sichuan River movement by 100%. The 12 yuan cotton yarn is increased to 24 yuan, and other items such as pied head groceries and cigarettes are also increased by one fold according to the original cost of water. However, those that have already been announced are 10 yuan per piece of cotton yarn, etc. The remaining will be increased again from March 1st, and the new price of 100% will be charged.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Continued Discussion <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>There are many goods for which the price is increased, some are calculated by size, and some are calculated by weight. This time, the wheel companies publicly agreed that for the loading and transportation of each cargo, in addition to paying according to the newly set freight, the size and weight must be counted together with the bag skin box, etc., and there must be no so-called gross jin net jin discount as before. Those who occupy the area are also counted in this way, so yesterday afternoon, the representatives of the wheel companies gathered again in the Taigu company to discuss this issue.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Hakka Dispute <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan Gang customs brokers have a lot of disputes with the wheel company on the size and weight of the new agreed transportation of goods. The reason is that the gross and net calculation of the fee for the cargo, the measurement, all the Chinese wheel companies in the Yangtze River have always done so, and now once the new chapter is changed, it will cause a lot of losses to the loader. The company side, on the other hand, based on the foreign ship's fixed example, there is no way to charge the gross and net fee. This change in the cost of water is not specially created by the Sichuan River Wheel Bureau. On this issue, both sides have a lot of disputes, and it has not been resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Suspend Handling of Goods <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan Gang Hakkas in Shanghai think that the cost of water that the wheel companies are discussing to increase now is too huge, and the original transportation rate is doubled. They are also so serious about the size and weight. The Hakkas have met many times, and they all think that there are still many stocks in Sichuan. Even if the current suspension of transportation, it will not have any impact on the Sichuan provincial market, and it can turn the price of goods slightly higher. Yesterday, the Sichuan Gang has publicly agreed and jointly telegraphed to Chongqing, reporting the situation of the Shanghai wheel companies increasing the cost of water, and please stop handling goods from today onwards, as the only way to deal with the Sichuan River wheel companies. The telegram was sent yesterday, and the goods going to the Sichuan River wheel will be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Inciting Public Outrage from All Tenants</p>
<p>Organize a Housing Association to Deal with It Together</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency said that Sun Chuanfang, the former commander of the Five Provinces Allied Army, had a lot of industries in Shanghai. After resigning from office, fearing that there would be inconveniences, he entrusted the Yipin Bank in this city to handle the closure. First, the right to rent more than two hundred houses in Xicheng Lane, Malang Road, was taken back. However, after the recovery, it was found that some tenants in the lane had rent arrears of two or three months. The rental office did not give notice in advance, so it sued the court and sealed it up. There were as many as thirteen families. At that time, most of the tenants had only women and children at home. Hearing the news of the sealing, they were extremely panicked and begged repeatedly, but the rental account room insisted on not allowing it, which incited public outrage from more than two hundred households in Xicheng Lane. Therefore, a tenants' association was organized, and lawyer Wu Kaisheng was hired to file a counterclaim. Yesterday, some other tenants in the lane received a warning from the owner that they would be issued a second seal. The tenants were very angry. In addition to following the resolutions of the general meeting, they also planned to issue a declaration on Sun Chuanfang's harsh behavior and ask for social assistance.</p>

This invitation to visit is intended to attract business on the one hand, and on the other hand, the bureau is currently engaged in drafting passenger car standards, but this passenger train is not manufactured according to the standards, and is limited by the period and the ability of the machine factory. Of course, there are many unsatisfactory places. Take this opportunity to seek criticism from all parties for future reference when implementing and determining passenger car standards. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Although the carriages of the train are made of wood and painted with blue paint, their appearance is no less beautiful than that of blue steel cars. All the signs outside the carriages are made of a bright metal, which is quite eye-catching. The organization of the entire train includes a first-class sleeper car with 16 berths, a first-class compartment sleeper car with 20 seats and 6 berths, two second-class sleeper cars with 30 berths each, a dining car, three third-class passenger cars with 94 seats each, and a heating and postal car, a luggage and conductor's car, totaling ten cars, accommodating 384 people.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Comfortable Facilities <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Ping Joint Transport Passenger Train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway travels a long distance and takes a considerable amount of time. To prevent passengers from becoming tired from their journey, the train is equipped with very comfortable facilities. These include the following features: (1) First-class sleeping cars, with eight compartments separated, each with two berths, one upper and one lower. During the day, the lower berth can be converted into a seat. In addition, the lounge car has three compartments with the same facilities. The lounge features extremely comfortable swivel chairs, which are especially popular with passengers. Each berth has a clothes hook and a storage net. If passengers have small items, they can be placed in the net to avoid loss. Second-class sleeping cars have seven compartments each, except for one with only one upper and one lower berth. The others have four berths each, and the upper berths can be folded up during the day to avoid interfering with seating. The berths are all made of leather and have springs inside, making them exceptionally soft. (2) In the dining car and sleeping cars, in addition to the usual large glass windows, there are small windows above that can be opened and closed at any time. Whether in winter or summer, there is ample fresh air. The ventilation is well-regulated, and the air contains very little smoke and dust, making it very suitable for travel hygiene. (3) All trains are equipped with heating. The sleeping car compartments also have heating regulators, which can be used to increase or decrease the temperature at any time. In summer, each compartment has a fan to avoid stuffiness. (4) Each berth is equipped with a lamp suitable for passengers to read books and newspapers. In addition to the electric stove and toilet, there are bright lights, making it convenient to enter and exit. There are also bright lights at the passenger entrances and exits of each car, not only preventing falls but also making it easy to identify the class of the car at night. The third-class cars have ten electric lights throughout, which are also quite bright. (5) In the first-class dining car, one part is the kitchen, and the other part is the dining room. The kitchen is equipped with a refrigerator, and the dining room has six large dining tables, each seating four people, and six small dining tables, each seating two people. In total, it can accommodate thirty-six people dining at the same time, and the space is quite spacious.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Capital Railway Ferry last October, the Shanghai-Ping Joint Transport service has been realized. Initially, the Beining Railway prepared one train, and the Jinpu Railway prepared five trains, forming trains No. 301 and 302, which ran every other day. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway should have prepared one train, but due to the lack of a lounge car, a dining car, and two second-class sleeping cars, its participation was temporarily delayed. The equipment was temporarily borrowed from the Jinpu Railway, and the Wusong Machinery Factory was urged to assemble the car bodies from the original undercarriages and rush to manufacture them. At the same time, the vehicles scheduled to be included were extensively repaired. Now that the work has been completed and the test run is good, it has been decided that Train No. 302, the third Shanghai-Ping through train, will begin running from Shanghai at 12:00 PM on the 25th of this month.</p>

<p>Last night, Mo Heng, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Two Railways Administration, told a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency that the Shanghai-Ping through train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has a total of ten cars, which were rebuilt by the Wusong Machinery Factory from the original undercarriages. The body renovation costs for the four cars, such as sleeping cars, lounge cars, and dining cars, totaled 177,000 yuan. Adding the costs of repairing other vehicles, the total cost was more than 200,000 yuan. It has now been decided to start running on the evening of the 25th, and the cars borrowed from the Jinpu Railway will be returned. The Railway Bureau also plans to have the Wusong Machinery Factory rebuild another train for its use.</p>

<p>Supporting Wang and Chiang's Sincere Telegram Proposals</p>
<p>Please Eliminate Sun Dianying's Rebellion</p>
<p>More than 160 trade associations in this city, including the Rice Industry, Silk Industry, Cotton Fabric Industry, Sugar Industry, Wood Industry, Mineral Ash Factory Industry, Dyeing and Weaving Industry, and Sausage Industry, jointly telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, requesting the swift elimination of Sun Dianying's rebellion to pacify the Northwest, and telegraphed their support for Wang and Chiang's sincere telegram proposals. The contents are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e150">Supporting Wang and Chiang's Sincere Telegram Proposals <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, all national party and government organs, and all mass organizations:</p>
<p>For many years, the country has been troubled. Internationally, there is a crisis of hegemonic competition. Domestically, there is a risk of economic bankruptcy. Yet, ambitious warlords, disregarding betrayal and hatred, and the rampant Red bandits, are still jumping and seeking to achieve their ambitions. The national steps are more difficult, and the national situation is more pressing. Fortunately, the central authorities are consolidated, and the soldiers are sincere, suppressing rebellion invisibly, and striving to govern diligently. We respectfully endorse Premier Wang and Chairman Chiang's sincere joint telegram, which proposes the eradication of Red bandits as a short-term solution and the construction of people's livelihood as a long-term solution, further emphasizing the spirit and expectation of sincere unity and close cooperation. This is indeed the essence of peace and struggle, saving China, as taught by the late Premier. The associations are humbly the pioneers of industry and commerce, protecting the country, and loyal to the government. We have no hesitation in our righteousness and vow to wholeheartedly support and fulfill the duty of citizens, elevating the national fortune to prosperity. We hereby send this telegram for your consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Rice Industry, Silk Industry, Cotton Fabric Industry, Sugar Industry, Wood Industry, Mineral Ash Factory Industry, Dyeing and Weaving Industry, Sausage Industry, and more than 160 other trade associations.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Please Eliminate Sun Dianying's Rebellion <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Chiang:</p>
<p>Since the Sun Dianying rebellion began, it has been a month of conflict and war, causing severe hardship to the people. We know that the Central Government has been aiming for sincere unity to overcome national difficulties. For any occasional mishaps in various regions, the Central Government has always been tolerant, hoping to maintain domestic peace. However, Sun's rebellion is arrogant and tyrannical. Although the Central Government has repeatedly given him opportunities to awaken, he has shown no remorse. The Northwest is a barren land, and years of drought have impoverished the people. How can they endure further disturbances and suffer the misery of exploitation again? Moreover, at a time when strong enemies are watching and Red bandits are jumping, such a reckless army can only embolden the enemy and inflame the rebellion. Therefore, we urgently appeal to the Central Government to make a decisive decision, without further indulgence. Remove Qingfu to eliminate the troubles of Lu, pacify the Northwest, and relieve the people from their suffering. This is not only the fortune of the people of Qingning, but also deeply related to the national prestige, production, and construction. We earnestly request your consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Two Telegrams from the Navy Special Party Department <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Responding to Wang and Chiang's Sincere Telegram</p>
<p>Clearly Order the Punishment of Sun Dianying</p>
<p>Since Wang and Chiang issued their sincere telegram, solemnly declaring the great plan to save the nation and ensure its survival, telegrams of support have poured in from all sides. The Navy Special Party Department also sent a telegram yesterday in response, urging the nation to unite as one, and telegraphed the Central Government, requesting a clear order to punish Sun Dianying in order to secure the border regions. The contents of the two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e154">Telegram One <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>To all newspapers across the country for the information of all compatriots and comrades:</p>
<p>Having read Premier Wang and Chairman Chiang's sincere telegram, which reiterates the great plan to save the nation and ensure its survival, and informs the people of the essential principle that the central government and local authorities must be sincere with each other and work closely together, we are deeply moved by the earnest and heartfelt words. In the face of internal and external troubles pressing upon us, it is stated that eradicating the Red bandits is essential to eliminating the root of national disaster in the short term, and that production and construction are essential to enriching national strength in the long term. These two are truly good methods to save and preserve the nation today. However, without the sincere unity and concerted cooperation of the entire nation, it is truly insufficient to achieve success and reach supreme governance. This association will lead all comrades in the army to vow to follow this purpose and strive forward together. We hope that all compatriots will encourage each other. The future of the Party and the nation deeply depends on it.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Navy Special Party Department</p>
<h3 id="e155">Telegram Two <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>To the Central Executive Committee:</p>
<p>The Party and the nation are unfortunate, and war disasters have multiplied. The rebellion in Fujian Province has just been quelled, and the changes in Ningxia have risen again. At a time when the nation is facing many difficulties, the central government is pouring all its efforts into suppressing bandits and construction, with no time to spare. Anyone with conscience should consider the difficulties of the times and strive together to wash away the humiliation and seek strength. However, Sun Dianying, relying on his troops, dares to disobey orders, betray public opinion, attack Ningxia, and disturb the western border. Judging from his intentions, he is harboring the ambition to seize a local stronghold and undermine unity. Such a heinous crime, if not severely punished, would be insufficient to maintain discipline and deter others from following suit. We request that the National Government promptly issue a clear order to punish him in order to pacify the people and secure the border regions. We cannot express our anticipation enough.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Navy Special Party Department</p>
<h3 id="e156">Municipal Executive Committee Appoints Two Members to Supervise Ancient Artifacts <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Ma Heng's arrival in Shanghai will allow inventory to begin.</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department's random inspection claim is completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the ancient artifacts of the Palace Museum are priceless treasures of our country and are of great importance to history and culture. For the sake of careful preservation, the Central Government, through the 107th Standing Committee meeting, decided that when newly appointed staff check and receive items, one member each from the Hebei Provincial Party Department and the Beijing Municipal Party Department should be dispatched to supervise the items in Beijing, and two members from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department should be dispatched to supervise the items in Shanghai. When the Shanghai Municipal Party Department received the order, it immediately sent personnel to contact the museum's Shanghai office. However, due to the importance of this matter and to ensure proper handling, it was brought up for discussion at the Executive Committee meeting yesterday, and Supervisors Wu Xiu and Cai Hongtian, both Executive Committee members, were appointed to handle the matter. However, Museum Director Ma Heng is still in Beijing, negotiating with all parties. According to news from the museum's Shanghai office, the inventory of the Shanghai items will begin as soon as Director Ma arrives in Shanghai. There are over 13,000 boxes of ancient artifacts in Shanghai, currently stored in warehouses on Tianzhutang Street and Sichuan Road. In the future, the inspection will be conducted simultaneously in groups to ensure speed. Reports from the previous day that the Municipal Party Department would conduct a random inspection due to the stored books being damp were completely inaccurate, and rumors of theft are baseless.</p>

<h3 id="e158">A Brief Account of the Tragic Disaster in Yuanwu County, Henan <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jehol Relief Association recently reported that according to the Yuanwu County Party Department and various organizations in Henan, Yuanwu County is small, covering only about 30 square li. The soil is barren, and the people are poor. Even in good years, they are still in distress. In 1911 of the Republic of China, soldiers and bandits were frequent, and Yuanwu was in the direct path of conflict. In the past three years, it has suffered from successive droughts and floods, making the disaster even more severe. Last summer, locusts were rampant, destroying most of the autumn crops. Disasters occurred one after another. On August 9th last year, the River God raged, with water depths of more than seven feet on the flat ground and floods lasting for five days. South of the county seat, it became a swamp. Villages were destroyed, livestock were swept away, and crops were submerged. The losses were estimated at over 5 million yuan. Fertile fields were turned into silt, with dozens of li of barren land and no vegetation. 40,000 disaster victims have nowhere to live. Now, heavy snow has fallen, and there is solid ice on the ground. The victims have no clothes to cover their bodies and no grain to fill their stomachs. Tree bark and grass roots have been dug up and are almost exhausted. They have no way to beg, and they lack the resources to flee to other places. They are suffering from both cold and hunger, and people are dying on the roads. The tragic situation is difficult to describe. We implore you to quickly dispatch benevolent relief to Yuanwu to save tens of thousands of disaster victims from their precarious situation. The urgent telegram cannot express our anticipation and waiting for orders.</p>
<p>For several years, there has been no place in our country without disasters. The Yellow River has flooded, and the victims are in provinces such as Shandong, Henan, and Hebei. Tens of thousands of families are in distress. Conscientious people who read the newspaper can save their New Year's entertainment funds to help these surviving people. This is what we hope from compassionate comrades.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Tea Industry Asks Anhui Province to Reduce the Business Tax <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>And Asks Not to Recruit Contractors</p>
<p>The Tea Association submits</p>
<p>Chen Zhaodao and others from the Shanghai Foreign Tea Association submit a document to the Ministry of Finance and the Anhui Provincial Government, stating the matter for which they are submitting:</p>
<p>Our export of boxed tea is suffering due to pressure from foreign teas, and sales have sharply declined, recently reaching almost zero. The government, to encourage exports, provides tax exemptions and tariff waivers. All miscellaneous taxes cannot be levied on exported boxed tea to protect domestic products and save tens of thousands of tea farmers, tea workers, and tea merchants. This benevolent policy has allowed us to continue operating. Last year, Anhui Province began levying a 0.4% business tax on boxed tea, which tea merchants painfully paid. This year, the tax has suddenly increased to 1.5%, which is like forcing a sick man to carry a heavy burden. How can we bear it? Furthermore, they are advertising for contractors, and the highest bidder wins, only knowing how to collect taxes and arbitrarily exploit us. According to the business tax regulations, a 0.2% tax is levied on tea, which includes domestic sales. It should be known that there are no taxes on exports from inland provinces, and heavy and light taxes should be handled separately. Regardless of whether the province's levy exceeds the scope, the tax levied last year cannot be increased this year. This principle is very clear. We implore you to telegraph the Anhui Finance Department, stating that the business tax on exported boxed tea should be handled according to the precedent set last year. Do not recruit contractors, as this would add another layer of exploitation. Payments can be made directly by the tea associations in each production area. We express our urgent plea and await your orders with utmost gratitude.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government replies</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government's reply states:</p>
<p>The submission has been noted. The Finance Department is instructed to investigate and comply.</p>

Wu confirmed the facts and approved the request. Wu Naixian (from Guangdong) was appointed to fill the vacancy. It is reported that Chief Wu had worked at the Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force for many years and had extensive experience in handling arrest matters and achieved excellent results.

<p>In addition to Mayor Wu, the leaders from all walks of life and the leaders and members of the fundraising teams who attended yesterday's gathering included Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu (represented by Qiao Wenshou), Du Yuesheng (represented by Pang Jingzhou), Yan Fuqing, Xu Peihuang, Zhu Shaoping, Wang Xiaolai (represented by Li Dachao), Li Tingan, Yuan Ludeng, Xiao Zhiji's wife, Lin Huizhen, Lu Bohong, Chen Bingqian, Shen Yi, Lu Shaotang, Li Zushen, Lu Ganchen, Zheng Xitao, Tang Youwei, Xu Shuping, Yang Dunfu, Ding Fubao, Ding Huikang, Zhang Yishu, Hu Yongqi, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Liting, He Dekui, and more than forty foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Mayor's Speech <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting began, Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a speech, saying in essence that the purpose of inviting everyone today was to raise funds for the construction of the leprosy sanatorium initiated by the China Leprosy Relief Association. The fundraising work of the association began nearly five weeks ago, and it was inevitably somewhat delayed due to the Lunar New Year holiday. At present, only one-quarter of the target remains. With Shanghai's large population and your enthusiastic support, it will certainly not be difficult to achieve. The fundraising and preparatory work can be said to be already underway. I am willing to make a final effort to ensure its success. We must know that since we cannot live apart from society, we should naturally fulfill our unavoidable obligations in society. Moreover, this kind of undertaking seeks the welfare of society. Many foreigners have generously donated to this fundraising, which shows that the current concept of humanity towards society is different from the past and is gradually evolving from local to international. Chinese people are not inactive in relief and charitable undertakings, but most of them are close to passive methods, such as providing clothing and food only after people have suffered from cold and hunger. I hope that Chinese people will be aware of the need to adopt proactive methods in the future to prevent cold and hunger from occurring in the first place. The construction of the leprosy sanatorium is a proactive method of relieving society.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Yuan and Yan Give Speeches <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Next, General Team Leader Yuan Ludeng gave a speech, saying in essence that he greatly hoped that the fundraising conference for the construction of the leprosy sanatorium by the Leprosy Relief Association would succeed. Half of the project has already been completed, and it is certain that it will be fully completed soon. He was very pleased. Leprosy is not easy to detect in cold climates, so it is not often found in Shanghai. He initially thought that only Guangdong and Fujian had the disease, but according to the reports and statistics from various hospitals in Shanghai, there are already more than 2,000 cases. Everyone does not pay much attention to it. If relief is not provided, it will become increasingly widespread in the future and will be unavoidable, truly becoming a great disaster. He sincerely hoped that those with the ability would bravely help. Then, Deputy General Team Leader Yan Fuqing, who is also the President of the China Leprosy Relief Association, gave a speech, saying in essence that leprosy relief efforts, whether indirect or direct, exist in many places, but they are limited by economic resources and cannot be expanded. The Philippine Department of Health's entire budget is 5 million pesos per year, and the amount used for leprosy relief accounts for 2 million pesos. Our country only spends 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per year, a vast difference. Therefore, he sincerely hoped that enthusiastic people from society could voluntarily support the development of this undertaking. Deputy General Team Leader Xu Xinliu then gave a speech on behalf of Gao Wenshou and Lu Bohong, which is omitted for brevity.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Work Report <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The association's general secretary, Wu Zhijian, reported on recent progress, stating that fundraising efforts have reached three-quarters of the goal. The original date for the fourth and final announcement was February 10th, but it was temporarily suspended due to the lunar new year holiday. The deadline has now been extended to March 10th, which will be the closing date for fundraising. The total amount to be raised is 100,000, which will be used to start the construction project once collected. The site has been determined to be in Wusong Town, with over 100 acres of land purchased. Architect Fan Wenzhao has already created the drawings. The facilities of this type of leprosy sanatorium are different from the past. Previously, leprosy patients could only enter and not leave; entering the hospital was tantamount to dying. Now, with the advancement of science, a treatment for leprosy has been discovered. The purpose of patients entering the hospital is to be cured. The sanatorium also has workshops for patients to work in, hence the participation of the Vocational Education Society among the association's members. Each ward in the sanatorium will house a maximum of seven or eight, or five or six people. All facilities are exceptionally well-equipped. Construction is expected to begin soon.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Fundraising Conclusion <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Subsequently, Secretary Gao Mingqiang reported the results of the fundraising. In addition to the 40,000 already secured, the results of the third phase of fundraising were announced on February 3rd. The actual amount received for the fourth phase of fundraising reached 5,275 yuan. Together with the previous three phases, the total is 15,426 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen. The amount pledged is estimated at 18,665 yuan. The total of actual receipts and pledges reached 34,091 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen. There were also on-the-spot pledges made today, including 5,000 yuan pledged by Mayor Wu, 3,000 yuan pledged by Chen Bingqian, 2,000 yuan pledged by Lu Bohong, 1,000 yuan pledged by Lu Shaotang, and 300 yuan pledged by Li Zushen, totaling 11,300 yuan. The shortfall is only over 9,000 yuan. However, many teams have yet to report their results, so it is expected that the goal will be reached soon.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Animal Protection Association Requests Strict Prohibition of Tortoise Killing <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Shells Cracking, Flesh Dug Out, Fresh Blood Splattering</p>
<p>Heads and Feet Shrinking Tightly, Too Horrific to Witness</p>
<p>The China Animal Protection Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau yesterday, requesting that it issue orders to strictly prohibit the killing of tortoises in order to uphold benevolent governance and save sentient beings. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the esteemed Bureau,</p>
<p>Previously, a letter from the Life Protection Newspaper, a member of our association, stated that along the riverbank in Xujiahui in this city, there are many small boats that specialize in catching and nailing tortoises year-round. The slaughter is even more severe during the autumn equinox. Every time they are slaughtered, shells are cracked, flesh is dug out, and fresh blood splatters. Heads and feet shrink into a ball, and they can still stretch out for a long time. If it were not for unbearable pain, why would they do so? Although tortoises are insignificant creatures, they are the longest-living animals, hence their difficulty in dying. At this time of autumn and winter, the intense heat will pass. Allowing blood and flesh to be scattered everywhere, attracting mosquitoes and flies, will further harm public health. This cruel behavior is heartbreaking to hear. Since these creatures do not harm humans and are not food items, why not let them live and die naturally? However, some ignorant people actually use this petty profit to abandon all conscience and resort to such cruel methods. Their cruelty is extreme. Therefore, we specifically request that your esteemed Bureau devise methods for relief to protect animals and other creatures.</p>
<p>In addition to replying to the letter, we hereby send this letter to your esteemed Bureau, requesting that you issue orders for strict prohibition to uphold benevolent governance and save sentient beings.</p>

<p>Complex Circumstances, Numerous Evil Deeds</p>
<p>Postponement Granted for Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>The home of Yuan Zhaoqing, a Dongtai native who opened a Rickshaw Company at No. 1 Zhishun Lane, Rue Poinsett in the French Concession, was robbed of clothing and cash worth over 4,000 yuan on the evening of the 29th of last month. After investigation by the second team of detectives of the French Police, detectives Lu Zhulin and Wang Rusong, deputy detectives Zhang Daorong, and detectives Liu Jinrong, Shen Jinshi, and Lu Jinxiang, at 5 pm on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, bandits Xu Guifa (nickname Rotten Foot Ningbo or Foolish Da), Chen Rongsheng, Chen Jinchang, Chen Kejian, Chen Shurong, Zhang Qichang, Zhang Guibao, Zhang Asan, and female bandits Chen Ge, Chen Shi, and Huang Linmei, a total of eleven people, were arrested successively at No. 128 on Avenue Foch in the Public Concession and No. 18 Tianyou Lane, Haichang Road in Zhabei. Five pistols (four of which were snatched from the victims and Chinese and Indian patrolmen of the British Concession and border police) and forty-nine bullets were seized. The original stolen cash of 300 yuan was recovered. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. During the postponement, it was found that the bandits had conspired to commit murder in October of the seventeenth year [of the Republic], and had robbed a bank of over 100,000 yuan four or five years ago. In January of this year, they robbed guests of diamond rings and huge sums of money in a brothel. These cases have already been reported in the previous newspapers. At 11 am yesterday, Judge Wu Fanglian proposed a continuation of the trial in the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. According to the police lawyer Gu Shouxi, the police found during the postponement that the defendants had committed eight or nine robbery cases in the concession. The first and third defendants are also guilty of murder. The circumstances are complex and the investigation procedures have not yet been completed. He requested another two weeks postponement to investigate the detailed facts of the case and sue for trial. Subsequently, the lawyers Wang Shizong and Li Pengcheng, hired by Chen Ge, Chen Shi, Zhang Asan and others, stated that the defendants had committed relatively minor crimes in the case and requested that they be allowed bail during the postponement, pending trial. The court verified the report, briefly questioned each defendant, and ordered that the case was serious, bail was not allowed, and the trial would be postponed to March 6th. The defendants were still sent back to custody separately.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Rugao Kidnappers Transferred <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>No Crimes Committed in Shanghai</p>
<p>Seven Bandits Allowed to Be Transferred to Water Police</p>
<p>Lu Zicai's beloved five-year-old son, Zhongbao, a resident of No. 41 Yingfeng Lane, 14th District, Rugao County, Jiangbei, and the head of the local district defense corps, was kidnapped at the end of the lunar third month of last year [of the Republic] and hidden away, demanding a huge ransom of 17,000 yuan. The bandit gang was captured by the 11th Detachment of the 3rd District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Corps stationed in the county and sent to the 3rd District for transfer to the Jiangsu Security Office for interrogation. At the beginning of this month, the victim, Lu Zicai, received another letter from the bandits, asking him to come to Shanghai on the 10th to negotiate the ransom in the Rue du Marché in the French Concession. Because Lu Zicai had difficulty raising a huge amount of money, he reported it to the 3rd District of the Water Police Corps, which sent personnel to come to Shanghai with him to report to the French Police for assistance in the arrest. The Special Organ Inspector, Jin Jiulin, along with Detective Zhang Ziying, Deputy Detective Zhou Bingcheng, and undercover detectives from the general shift, rushed to the corner of Rue du Marché and Avenue Birt on the morning of the incident to wait, and according to the kidnappers' agreement, ordered the victim's side to send someone with a white briefcase as a sign. Not long after waiting, kidnappers arrived to negotiate, and the bandits Shao Jinlan, Yan Changcai, Gong Zhihua, Yan Shoucai, Yang Shoufu, and others were arrested. In addition, the young hostage Lu Zhongbao was found in the back room of No. 5 Fude Lane, Minli Road, Zhabei, and the old woman watching the hostage, Wang Xu, and the young woman, Deng Xiayun, were also arrested and taken back to the police station for interrogation and detention by the Second Special District Court in order to investigate whether the bandits had committed other crimes in Shanghai. The postponement of the trial to the 26th has already been reported in the previous newspapers. The French Police have already found that the criminals had not committed any other crimes in Shanghai, so no public prosecution was filed. The Director of the 3rd District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Corps stationed in Nantong, Chi Yaozhong, sent Detective Director Zhang Jingtang to Shanghai with a document, requesting the Second Special District Court to transfer the defendants to be tried. The court notified the police station, and at 10 am yesterday, seven male and female bandits and the hostage were escorted to the court. Judge Sun Penghang took the seat in the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. First, the police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated that the defendants had committed a kidnapping case in Rugao County in the mainland, and negotiated the ransom in Shanghai. The French Police assisted in the arrest based on the report. Now it has been found that the defendants have not committed any other crimes in the concession. The police station has no objection to the Water Police Corps' request for transfer. Judge Sun verified the report, questioned the defendants, reviewed the Water Police Corps' document, and summoned Zhang Jingtang, the Detective Director of the Water Police Corps, to the court to inquire about the handling of the case. He then ordered that the seven defendants, along with the hostage, be handed over to Zhang Jingtang, the Detective Director of the 3rd District of the Water Police Corps, for trial in the case.</p>

The head had seven knife wounds, and the front chest had two knife wounds. It was observed that the murderer seemed to want to cut open the abdomen. It was confirmed that the death was due to knife wounds. The corpse identification form was filled out.

<p>Zhang Xigen's Injuries Are Not Light</p>
<p>Zhang Xigen, a native of Ningbo, 29 years old, lives at No. 272 Chengjing Lane, Feihong Road, Hongzhen. He used to work on a ship, but is now unemployed. He has a friend named Mao Alin. They had a quarrel once over money, but then they were at peace. At around 10:50 last night, Zhang was walking past the entrance of Hehua Lane, Dongyouheng Road, when he suddenly encountered Mao Alin standing there with two other people. Mao saw Zhang coming and, without asking any questions, took out a gun and fired five shots at him, hitting him four times. One shot hit Zhang's abdomen, one next to his breast, one in his back, and one in his thigh. He collapsed to the ground, covered in blood. The assailant, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled in a chaotic rush. The injured person was taken by his wife in a car to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. Jia, the owner of the Hetae Tobacco and Paper Store on Avenue Edward VII, because a friend temporarily transferred 3,000 yuan in foreign currency to him, instructed him to send it to the China Industrial Bank on Xixinqiao Street. Mr. Jia instructed a partner to wrap the banknotes in newspaper and send it there at around 9:45 yesterday morning. As the partner was carrying the package past the entrance of No. 414 on the same road, he suddenly encountered four bandits. One of them was holding a pistol and spoke in the local dialect, blocking the way and threatening with the gun, taking all the money. The bandits fled without a trace. After the incident, the partner had to return to the store to report the robbery to the owner and report it to the police station to investigate and handle the criminals.</p>

<p>Inventory Reaches 50,000 Bales</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun yesterday, since November of the lunar calendar last year, the cotton industry in this port has been in a slump, but everyone hopes for an improvement this spring. Unexpectedly, all places are still idle as before, without any sign of recovery. The inventory of Japanese silk at the end of January reached 30,000 bales, and the output of manufactured goods is also increasing day by day, so that there is no room for self-use warehouses. Judging from the current situation, it should be more than one million bales by the end of this month. Looking back at the market conditions of Japanese silk in January last year, although the Shanhaiguan and Rehe issues continued to occur, the transaction was still good until the end of the lunar new year. Therefore, compared with the same period last year, the sales volume is vastly different. Moreover, there have been no major unrest incidents at home and abroad this year, but the sales volume is contrary to the past, indicating the poverty of the economic sector and a sharp reduction in purchasing power. It is heard that from the end of January to the present, the accumulation of Chinese silk is also 135,000 bales, and each Chinese factory has suspended business due to the old New Year, when it is around 50,000 to 60,000 bales.</p>

<p>Training Expenses: 3,241.53 Yuan</p>
<p>In 1931, the Jianghai Customs agreed with the Municipal Council to send three foreign water police officers to the Municipal Council Fire Department for training for a period of six months. Recently, it consulted with the Municipal Council again on whether to send twenty-one more Chinese water police officers to the department for training for a period of one year in addition to the three officers. It also inquired about the amount of expenses required. According to the investigation report of the director of the Fire Department, the training expenses for the Chinese and foreign police officers should be 3,241.53 yuan. If the Fire Department provides uniforms, the cost will be 3,161.64 yuan. All risks of death, injury, and disability during the training period should also be borne by the Customs. The Director of Finance agreed with this proposal, but argued that the drug costs for the officers should be paid by the Customs, and the accommodation costs for the officers should be paid appropriately. This case was discussed by the Security Committee, and it was decided to follow the points raised by the Fire Department and the Finance Department and allow it to be done accordingly. The Board of Directors passed the proposed resolution yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Municipal Council to Take Over Relief for Leprosy <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association recently sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting a donation of 100,000 yuan for the construction of a hospital in Wusong. This matter was discussed by the Health Committee. According to the investigation, the average number of leprosy cases found in the concession each year from 1929 to 1932 was less than five. Therefore, the Health Department's opinion is that the donation layer seems to lack sufficient reason, but the Municipal Council can be responsible for the hospitalization costs of patients in the hospital in the future, with a limit of ten people, both male and female, but only for patients occurring in the concession. This amount is not used as a subsidy, but is paid by the Municipal Council in accordance with the charging regulations, with a limit of 200 yuan per person per year. This proposal was adopted by the Board of Directors and has been replied to the Association.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Navigation Administration Forbids Crew Members from Serving During the Certificate Application Period <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>China Association of Ship Engineers Submitted a Petition to the Ministry for Correction Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Association of Ship Engineers recently petitioned the Ministry of Transportation to stop the Shanghai Navigation Administration from forbidding crew members in the certificate application period from serving on ships. The original text read:</p>
<p>Submitting a petition for being denounced due to official business, making things difficult for no reason, petitioning for justice, strictly investigating and punishing to uphold the law and purify officialdom.</p>
<p>The association previously submitted a petition for the Shanghai Navigation Administration's handling of crew members impersonating others, serving without certificates, and illegally favoring them without taking action, resulting in the unemployment of most crew members with certificates. This petition was submitted to the Ministry for thorough investigation.</p>
<p>During this investigation period, the association believed that the facts were there, and no matter what, it would be difficult to deny them. In the future, the solution will be revealed. Unexpectedly, the bureau did not reflect on itself, but instead harbored resentment because of this, and used its power to destroy the association's members to vent its anger. Li Junjin, a member, has been working as a second engineer on the Yong'an ship of the Dazhen Company for a long time. In December of last year, he entrusted the association to apply for a Class B Second Engineer certificate on his behalf. Only because the ministry had not approved the petition for many days, he was waiting quietly for inspection and processing. On the 30th of last month, the bureau suddenly pointed out that he had not received the certificate, refused to close the customs, and did not handle it according to the established practice of allowing crew members to serve during the certificate application period. Although the association prepared a letter of proof for him, it refused to accept it. The member was forced to leave the ship and leave his job, suffering damage.</p>
<p>It is the bureau's duty to allow crew members to serve during the certificate application period. How can it pretend not to know? If it is said that the approval is not followed, it is not credible, then the time of processing is either slow or fast, which is not something that the association can ask. However, since it has prepared a letter of proof, if it is false, the person in charge is responsible. Why must it be demanded outside the law? If it is not for being denounced due to official business, and it is not hesitated to use accidents to seek revenge, disturb the association, it will not be so oppressed. With this phenomenon, the association believes that the gap has been opened, the future is long, and the future troubles are worrying. For this reason, a text is prepared to detail the details and send the original letter together. Please uphold justice, strictly investigate and punish, to uphold the law and purify officialdom. The association is fortunate, and the shipping industry is fortunate.</p>

<p>Bullet Pierces Coat Corner, Luckily Unharmed</p>
<p>Police Arrest Several Kidnappers</p>
<p>Robert Sheng, a Western doctor from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, drove his own car, No. 6884, on the morning of January 31st, before dawn at around 3 am, intending to return to his residence. Unexpectedly, he encountered several bandits on Route Haddon in Western Shanghai. They jumped into the car and monitored Robert Sheng, driving straight to Route de la Gare in the French Concession. Because the Westerner shouted loudly, he was shot by the kidnappers as a warning. The bullet pierced through the corner of the Westerner's coat, luckily without injury. The bandits were also afraid of failure, so they got out of the car together and fled. Afterwards, the Westerner reported the case to the police station and asked for investigation. Since the occurrence of this case, the police stations have paid great attention to it, and all Chinese and Western detectives have been ordered to pay attention and investigate. The Chief Inspector of the Police Department, Lu Liankui, Detectives Shen Tianbao and Zhou Honglin, etc., learned that the bandits in this case were hiding at No. 1, Lane 23, Rue Birt in the French Concession. They secretly went there with weapons at around 6 am yesterday, along with Detectives Liu Shaokui and Feng Zhiming, etc. They arrested several male and female bandits at the address with the cooperation of French police detectives and took them back to the police station for interrogation. One of the bandits admitted to the kidnapping and confessed that there was a pistol and seven bullets hidden in the ditch near the Hongqiao Airport. The Chinese and Western detectives then went to the airport with the police detectives from the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, searched out the guns and bullets, and brought them back to the police station. The police station is now investigating the remaining fugitives in detail, so that they can be sent to the First Special District Court for trial in the coming days.</p>

<p>The phonograph record industry has long been dominated by foreign merchants. The Great Wall Company is the only one founded with purely Chinese capital. The shareholders of the company are all well-known figures in Shanghai, such as Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Danru, Li Zushen, Lai Yongfang, Sheng Zecheng, Yao Mulian, Wu Yunzhai, Li Gufan, Li Zuen, Wang Wenzhi, Qin Daishi, Yu Yefeng, Chen Bo, Sun Nong, and many other celebrities, as well as the late Li Huiwu and Wang Xinguan. All of these gentlemen are the founders of the company. Its financial strength is enough to make the various companies operated by foreign merchants look at it with apprehension. Since the company started business last year, it has released more than one hundred types of records. The quality of the selected songs and the number of invited performers have truly set a new record never seen before in the record industry. Among its unique and rare products are the "Si Wu Hua Dong" sung by the Four Great Dan Actresses, the complete "Farewell My Concubine" sung by Mei Lanfang and Yang Lou, Yu Shuyan's "Zhuo Fang Su Dian," "Zhai Chan Hui," "Shi Jie Ting," "Wu Long Yuan," Mei Lanfang and Jiang Miaoxiang's "Mu Tian Wang," Mei Lanfang and Ru Fuhui's "Nü Qi Jie," Cheng Yanqiu and Wang Shaolou's "Fen He Wan," Shang Xiaoyun and Wang Xiaolou's "Wu Jia Po," Meng Xiaodong's "Zhuo Fang Cao," "Zhu Lian Zhai," Yang Xiaolou and Hao Shouchang's "Lian Huan Tao," "Ye Zhu Lin," Wang Ruiqing and Cheng Jixian's complete "Yue Lai Dian," and Zhang Eyun's "Su San Qi Jie." All of these records are famous operas that have never been recorded before. Therefore, within a year of release, sales have reached over 200,000 copies. Such achievements can be considered good news for a domestic enterprise. It is also reported that the company plans to hold a third recording session in the autumn to strengthen its resources and intends to broadly record the famous performers who were previously missed.</p>

<p>Citizens' Association of the Road Sends Letter to the Police Station Requesting Investigation</p>
<p>The Fuhua Xiang Foreign Goods Store at No. 88 North Fujian Road in this city was broken into by burglars who pried open the front door late at night on the 21st. Twenty-five pieces of silk fabric, worth about three to four hundred yuan, were stolen. Afterwards, it was learned that, in addition to the store reporting to the local police station, the store is located in the center of the road, and the burglars dared to pry open the door and calmly commit the theft, which must have taken a long time. This indicates that the police protection is insufficient. Therefore, a letter has been sent to the 37th District Citizens' Association and the North Fujian Road Businessmen's Association, requesting them to forward it to the Police Department for investigation. The two associations sent a letter to the Municipal Council's Police Department yesterday, stating (excerpted above): "This road is short and convenient for transportation, connected to the Old Zha Gate Bridge in the south, and is a main thoroughfare for pedestrians. It is a place where patrols pass by and guards are stationed. The store is located not far from the local police station. How could the store be calmly burglarized without the detectives being aware of it? This makes all the stores in this area feel uneasy. Therefore, we earnestly request you to order your subordinates to quickly investigate and solve the case, and to increase patrols at night to protect the city and maintain the residents' safety. We extend our respects."</p>

<p>Fuel for the Railway Bureau Calculated at Special Preferential Rates</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus have never had gas station facilities for public motor vehicles. Recently, they negotiated preferential terms with the Asiatic Petroleum Company. The price of gasoline used by the bureau will be calculated at a special rate. Therefore, a Shell gasoline station with a capacity of 5,460 kilograms will be installed at the Shanghai North Station, specifically for refueling the bureau's motor vehicles. Employees of the bureau who own their own cars can also refuel at this station and pay at the actual price paid by the bureau. The General Affairs Department has consulted with the Traffic Department and drafted eight management rules, which have been approved for implementation. The rules are as follows: (1) The gasoline station established by the bureau at the Shanghai North Station will have one staff member assigned by the Affairs Department as the manager, and one servant will be assigned nearby to be in charge of the management, both of whom will be supervised and guided by the Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department. (2) When the bureau's public motor vehicles need fuel, the person in charge from the Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department will issue a fuel requisition form, which will be given to the driver, who will take it to the gas station to obtain fuel. (3) The manager should record the quantity, date, and other details of fuel received, dispensed, and stored in the account book issued by the Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department for verification. (4) The manager should record the total amount of fuel stored. (5) Every week, the Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department will send personnel to check and verify the quantity of fuel stored and dispensed with the manager to ensure that it matches the amount recorded in the book. If there is any discrepancy, the reason for the discrepancy should be immediately investigated and reported to the responsible officer for handling. (6) If an employee of the bureau owns a motor vehicle and wants to refuel at this station, the employee must obtain a certificate from the department in charge and obtain a fuel requisition book from the Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department. The user must sign the book to obtain fuel from the gas station. (7) When an employee of the bureau obtains a fuel requisition form from the Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department, they must leave a seal or signature sample for verification. (8) The gasoline used by an employee of the bureau at this station will be settled monthly. The user must pay the fuel cost to the Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department for transfer to the Accounting Department within five days after receiving the bill or notification. If the payment is overdue, the preferential benefits will be immediately terminated, and the Accounting Department will be notified to deduct the overdue payment from the user's salary.</p>

<h3 id="e220">On Beating <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Looking at the theories of the new educators, most of them do not advocate the use of corporal punishment on elementary school students, but in reality, I don't know if elementary school students are still being hit on the palms by teachers now? If they are not anymore, then they are really happy, making those of us who studied ten years earlier envious.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, no elementary school student escaped being hit on the palm, and no matter how fiercely the teacher beat, parents and others would never say a word. We had a folk song that said:</p>
<p>"Parents beat, it is right to beat; teacher beats, paid to (him) beat; others beat, report to the Baozhang (i.e., Baozheng)."</p>
<p>Originally, the teacher's beating of students meant that the students paid for him to beat them. Why pay him to beat them? Probably because since ancient times, studying was for becoming an official, and officials could beat people. If you didn't study well, you couldn't become an official, and if you didn't become an official, you couldn't beat people. But to study well, you had to ask the teacher to supervise you strictly, and the strictest supervision was beating. Being beaten by the teacher meant that in the future, when you became an official, you could beat back on the people many times over, which was just like needing to invest capital first to earn interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese people in the past were all inevitably beaten by their parents, those who studied were beaten by their teachers, and those who didn't study were either beaten by officials, or by foremen, or by landlords...</p>
<p>We can say that those who have never been beaten cannot be considered Chinese.</p>
<p>I recently saw the following passage in the "Travels in China" by the Spanish literary giant Blasco Ibáñez:</p>
<p>"For five thousand years, that hard bamboo board has been the true authority in China. That magic board forces people to obey moral laws and operates the machinery of the country. Among the Chinese, the only person who will not be beaten is the emperor. In addition, even the most honorable officials or trusted favorites are inevitably beaten a dozen or twenty times under the emperor's orders to atone for their mistakes. After being beaten, they can still resume their old positions when the emperor expresses sympathy for them. A Chinese person, from childhood, is accustomed to being beaten by his parents, so no one is ashamed of being beaten a few times in their life. If they commit a fault, as long as they get a beating, their rice bowl will not be completely broken, and their power will not be reduced. They see being beaten as lightly as we see being fined by the city government. The Chinese police always carry bamboo sticks or whips in their hands, and immediately beat the people when they see them committing a crime."</p>
<p>Foreigners often exaggerate when talking about the unique aspects of China. This passage, at first glance, seems a bit exaggerated, but it is actually true. Even today, the situation of beating and being beaten is still like this. It's just that people don't necessarily use bamboo boards to beat people, but also palms, fists, leather shoes, gun butts, shoe soles, opium pipes... anything is possible, and the spectacle is imaginable!</p>
<h3 id="e221">Chinese Humor <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>I have said that the Chinese nation is not suitable for humor, because all so-called literature has almost always been controlled by the scholar-official class, and the atmosphere of the scholar-official class is the most anti-humorous. Occasionally, in the literature of the common people, we can see things similar to humor, but it is more appropriate to call that banter than humor, because in this banter there is a kind of vulgarity hidden, which cannot be compared with the intellectual metaphors we commonly call humor; on the contrary, this banter is extremely close to the vulgar, glib talk of the crosstalk performers in general variety shows, and perhaps the currently popular crosstalk has developed from the banter in the literature of the common people.</p>
<p>In the literature of the common people, this kind of banter is often inappropriately inserted in order to maintain the interest of the readers. Strictly speaking, it is harmful to the integrity of the art, but when we understand the author's intention, we are not too critical, and we might as well laugh along with the author. As for those ordinary readers, when they read such places, they will laugh heartily.</p>
<p>In books like "Three Heroes and Five Gallants," there are quite a few such examples. To understand what Chinese banter is, let's look at one or two examples. In the thirty-fifth chapter, it is written that Feng Junheng glanced at his cousin, and then the author bantered to explain it:</p>
<p>"He said that a single glance was inhuman, no human would glance like that. Often books often say "eyes and eyebrows convey affection," and also say "eyebrows come, eyes go." Thinking carefully, this eyebrow is useless, the eyes are for looking; the eyebrows follow behind. What's the point of stirring? Isn't that what they say? If it didn't have it, it would be really ugly. It's just like the joke says 丨丨 the mouth said to the nose: "Hey, old nose! What ability do you have to dare to live above me?" The nose slowly said: "If you didn't rely on me to smell, how would you distinguish between fragrance and foulness?" The nose also spoke to the eyes: "Cure, old eyes! What ability do you have to dare to live above me?" The eyes replied: "If you didn't rely on me to see, how would you know what's good or bad?" The eyes also spoke to the eyebrows: "Hey, old eyebrows! What ability do you have to dare to live above me?" The eyebrows replied: "I originally didn't have any ability, but I'm just your matching accessory. If you don't want me to be above you, then move to the bottom of you. See if you look like something or not. 丨丨 Feng Jun rushed his glance, really put the eyebrows in the wrong place."</p>
<p>This, like all vulgar, glib talk, is a disguised form of scolding; at the same time, like all vulgar, glib talk, this scolding, if carefully considered, is not very appropriate. From this kind of banter, you can see the scholar-official atmosphere in the literature of the common people, because the scolding is already cleverly scolded, and this scholar-official atmosphere is easily accepted by the general uneducated common people, or in other words, is easily infected by it. Therefore, it is probably not wrong to say that the popular crosstalk entertainment in Chinese society was originally learned by the common people from the scholar-officials; however, once it reached the mouths of the common people, it became more and more vulgar, and as a result, it became a complete vulgar, glib talk.</p>
<p>From such banter, we can see a principle that banter is used to conceal scolding, which becomes what we call sarcasm or bitterness, and this laughter is not good laughter. However, sometimes, although it still does not escape the air of bitterness, there are also examples of banter that are not deliberately arranged by the author, but created through the depiction of customs and human feelings. This is most vividly depicted in the ninety-third chapter of "Continued Little Five Nurturings," which describes the poor grandfather's performance on the Lei Tai. Although the original text is longer, it is necessary to quote it in order to explain the style of Chinese humor.</p>
<p>It is said that this poor man was so poor that he was in such a plight, how could he have the heart to perform on the Lei Tai? All because everyone urged him, and it was truly out of helplessness... He was worried about Ma Long, and thinking in his heart about comparing his posture, there was a person behind him who taught him to elbow a somersault. That person crawled up, pounding his chest, and hummed, "Ouch, ouch," and said, "Friend! Look, it's about time to go and find something to eat. Look at us, we all have cold rice when we go home after watching the Lei Tai. It seems that you, sir, have to go and find something now; if you miss the time, who can prepare something so readily for you? I'm saying good things."</p>
<p>"This gentleman's qi rushed upwards, and he said, "It's up to me whether I go to find something or not, what does it have to do with you?" That person said, "I'm just suffering from a chronic illness, and you elbowed me in the heart: you don't care whether I can bear it or not! Look, there are many people watching the excitement, who is like you bringing a posture to fight? If you really have the ability, go up and compete with this Taiguan; if you can really kick this Taiguan like me, it's a thousand taels; hit him with a punch, and you'll get fifty taels, enough to change your clothes; what's the point of this!" The poor man said, "I don't like changing clothes, you can't meddle in my business!" That person said, "I can't meddle. No more words, I'm going to stand in front of you."</p>
<p>"It just so happened that the poor man saw Ma Ye throw a punch that didn't hit the mark, and he compared his posture again, saying, "If it's like this, I might hit the Taiguan." With a bang, he hit that person's back heart again. That person let out an ouch, and plunged forward, if there weren't so many people, he would have almost fallen down.</p>
<p>"That person turned his head and said fiercely, "You poor ghost! Are you crazy from being poor! I haven't dodged you back and forth. Since you have this ability, why don't you go up and show your face? You only know how to bully me!" The poor man said, "I'm using my strength for that friend." That person said, "If you use your strength for that person again, I'll die! You're a good friend, go up!" The poor man said, "I'll go up, I'll go up! It's a pity that I'm wearing tattered clothes now 丨" That person said, "It's not about the clothes; if you really have the ability, people will change your clothes for you. I'm just afraid you don't dare to go up." The poor man said, "You've said so much that I have to go up." That person said, "Very good!" The poor man looked at his clothes... and still didn't want to go up.</p>
<p>"That injured person was originally a bad person: he secretly arranged with a dozen people to squeeze the poor man up, everyone put in their efforts, shouted in unison, and said, "Grandpa Poor has arrived!" And squeezed the poor man onto the stage..."</p>
<p>Here, there seems to be no bitterness from the author himself, but it is written about vulgar, glib-talking people, and the article becomes banter. Compared to the previous example, there is a slight difference, but they are largely the same.</p>
<p>This kind of Chinese banter is still continuing in modern literature, only with a different name, called humor. However, humor always cannot be separated from vulgar, glib talk, and its future is quite dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="e222">"Going Out" <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Mengke</p>
<p>I went to sleep amidst the crackling sounds, and woke up again amidst the crackling sounds, feeling half of my face hot, knowing that the sun had also risen. Today is New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Opening the east-facing window, a gust of wind brought in the smell of gunpowder, which made my head ache. Before me was a expanse of azure sea, the weather was so good!</p>
<p>After getting dressed, I took a handheld camera, wanting to "go out" early.</p>
<p>"Kill!...", just as I stepped out of the door, I heard a burst of sharp cries like magpies chirping beside my ears. A group of children, suddenly all dressed in new clothes, wearing red beards, and holding lacquered bright wooden swords and guns, were valiantly practicing a charge at the entrance of the alley.</p>
<p>The road was also quiet, the doors of the shops were tightly closed, and although there were many wonderful sayings on the red couplets, the red paper strips with "Let wealth be generated towards me" were all the same. The rumbling manure carts had all been cleared away. Only the "music team" that had appeared last night was still beating large gongs and drums, touring back and forth in one group after another. 丨 Although these heroes hadn't slept all night, the shared look of a smiling face proved that they were still in high spirits.</p>
<p>Walking, where to go, I didn't care. But then I encountered many new heroes. 丨丨 The performers were mostly wearing small melon-shaped caps, with long silk belts around their waists, the kind of characters who usually resolved disputes in the streets and alleys. Their pockets were full of "money crackers," treading softly, as if they were investigating who was there. If they encountered a Miss, they would think it was a great discovery, hurry to chase after her, and throw a handful on the ground, with a loud bang, everyone would laugh heartily. I heard that the Misses of Shanghai do not take their Pekingese dogs out for a walk on New Year's Day, and that is indeed reasonable.</p>
<p>Walking. Before me, iron wire nets were spread out, which startled me at this time, but I immediately realized that I was going to the "Chinese territory". Here, the iron wire nets were laid out on a small river, which is what is called a Ham by the people of Shanghai. Although this Ham was narrow, it was crowded with dozens of large and small grass boats. Golden-colored rice straw was stacked on the boat cups, looking from afar like countless earthen hills. Through the gaps between the boats, you could faintly see the purplish-brown mud kissing the boat's belly. 丨 The water having dried up in the winter, the farmers also actually had the opportunity to spend the New Year in this prosperous Shanghai! Most of the boats were inserted with three incense sticks and a pair of red candles, and some also set off a few strings of firecrackers, which was naturally to pray to the gods for protection, to sell those rice straws quickly, and to load a boat of fertilizer to take back when the spring tide rose. Didn't they spend their blood and sweat to earn all of that this year! Women were cooking at the stern of the boat, and smoke was everywhere. The children were rolling in the straw piles, making a fuss and laughing happily. Although none of them had new clothes to wear, they were always happy, it was the New Year!</p>
<p>Walking out of the iron gate, crossing the arched stone bridge, it was still a road, but there were no more skyscrapers, dried trees, withered yellow weeds, and abandoned fields, and also, there were rotten coffins, with the stench of corpses filling the air, lying scattered on the soil, which was probably beneficial to farming, although or to hygiene...? No, this was the countryside.</p>
<p>It is said that people who have lived in the city for a long time are bound to find everything lovely when they occasionally set foot in the countryside, but unfortunately, I was surrounded by countless beggars, unable to stroll freely.</p>
<p>When I turned back, the sun was overhead, and the breeze brought the sound of du du du, which was the factory's whistle for the workers to get off work. It must be time for the people who still had to work even during the New Year to rest, but the beggars still followed me closely, chasing after me, and also celebrating along the way, saying, "Sir, congratulations on making a fortune in the New Year!"</p>
<h3 id="e223">Interesting Metaphors <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(18)</p>
<p>You Xitang (Dong)'s "Miscellany" is a masterpiece in the genre of notebook novels. Xitang was, of course, also a famous scholar in literature and history. However, people only know him as a famous scholar, and do not know that he was once a lavish but poor literati. I once saw a letter of his to a friend, in which he said: "The year is coming to an end, the wind and rain are bleak! Paper windows and bamboo tails, the lamplight is green, I do not know where the beauty lies. The wild goose fur is ordinary, where is the lone sable? The fish pot is empty, where is the lamb? An ancient poet said: The wind wants to freeze the wine, the frost can break the cotton. Now there is no wine to freeze, no cotton to break, alas, alas, how to end the year?" When we read this in the lament of "how to end the year," we truly have some "real heart," the happiness is bitter, but there is interest in the bitterness, so I have attached it to the end of the interesting metaphors.</p>
<p>(19)</p>
<p>The above "Interesting Metaphors" are seventeen items. They were written when reading Zhou Liangong's "Collected from the Lai Gutang Correspondence," twelve volumes, Second Collection of "Hidden and Discarded Collection," sixteen volumes, Third Collection of "Neighborhood Collection," sixteen volumes. The reason for publishing them is just to elicit a smile from the readers in this painful year! The narrowness of the literary path lately is beyond words. I was neither born with the bones of a Westernized writer, nor can I fill my hungry stomach with the clear breeze and bright moon. I had no choice but to seek this bitter interest, and I truly have a feeling of crying and laughing. May the magnanimous and refined men of today understand me. Postscript on February 10, 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e224">I Curse That Smile of Yours (9) <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>Outside the bamboo cage surrounding the racetrack, the gray highway for trade with Yunnan and Myanmar rose up, winding down from the mountains, and crawling up again like a snake. On the mimosa vines that spread along the roadside, two or three points of dark green fireflies flowed, and when touched with the electric light, they disappeared into the grass.</p>
<p>When the electric light shone into the dark and gloomy jungle on the slope, the little birds roosting in the branches called out in panic, shaking their brow-like wings, scattering into the moonlit sky. After a while, it returned to silence. The surrounding blue mountain layers were sleeping quietly, and the bare feet of the moonlight stepped over them without seeming to notice at all.</p>
<p>Only the Bilang River, running from the Chinese fields in the gorge, was still singing alone and passionately in the deep night, as if having escaped its hometown and come to a foreign land, it was very happy and excited.</p>
<p>Light from the lamp in Old Liu's house shone through the cracks in the bamboo wall. We, the two night wanderers searching for beautiful women, opened the bamboo door and walked in. The shadow of the wild woman, with her black cloth-wrapped head and large earrings, making shoes under the oil lamp, was painted crudely on the bamboo wall. She looked up, stunned for a moment, and after I greeted her, she smiled and asked in Chinese:</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>She looked at the foreigner standing beside me, and a slightly surprised expression flowed out.</p>
<p>"He wants to check the people in this house to see if anyone is doing anything illegal."</p>
<p>I held back my laughter, deliberately using a very official tone to scare this usually unruly woman, while also trying to cover up this shameful thing, so that people wouldn't find out about it.</p>
<p>"Hehehe..."</p>
<p>"A strange laugh sounded from behind. Looking back, I didn't know when Old Liu had already been standing behind us. He hung down the corners of his mouth at me and smiled meaningfully, as if he was contemptuously saying 丨丨 Oh, you respectable young man! How come you're also doing the "pimping" thing? He said unhappily:</p>
<p>"Not a single Yi woman has come this evening!"</p>
<p>Needless to say, he was already preemptively guessing, just like my boss, and then said very angrily:</p>
<p>"Don't you have a lot of them in your shop?"</p>
<p>Looking at that kind of smile, hearing that kind of cold words, I was immediately annoyed. It was like being whipped heavily on the soul.</p>
<p>"It's none of my damn business, people are here to inspect!"</p>
<p>With my face flushed red, I reluctantly retorted, stuffed the flashlight to the foreigner, and angrily left alone.</p>
<p>When I got to the shop, I explained to the Indian man, and then went to sleep. As I took off my clothes, I suddenly thought:</p>
<p>"This is not right!"</p>

<p>Took the Lead First, followed by the three Westerners, and No. 1, Wang Shudian, trailing behind.

However, the road conditions were not good, with many gravel and stones, and</p>
<p>Uneven Surfaces. The athletes worked hard and remained consistent throughout. The first to reach the finish line was No. 20, Austrian Weiss, but because he used improper methods to force No. 6, Shen Shijun, to the side of the road 20 meters from the finish line, the competition committee decided to</p>

The original first-place finisher, No. 6, Shen Shijun, who unfortunately fell off his bike, and No. 13, Wang Ruixiang, who also fell off his bike due to being blocked by No. 20, Weiss, were both deemed to have performed well by the committee and were awarded souvenirs by the organizing committee.

<p>Secondary Schools to Be Held in Autumn</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in order to change the elementary school sports days to be held in the spring and secondary school sports days to be held in the autumn from this year onwards, specially issued instructions to the municipal and registered private primary and secondary schools yesterday, stating that the Education Association of the Fifth District of the city reported that the joint sports days of the city's primary schools have always been held in the autumn, and due to the coldness and the length of the days, it is quite inconvenient for students in rural areas to participate. Because transportation in rural areas is difficult, participation in the conference requires timely attendance, which inevitably requires traveling to Shanghai the day before. Some are able to travel back and forth on the same day, but because the competition ends late, they cannot catch the last ferry at 5:00 PM at the Tongren Wharf and must stay overnight in Shanghai. Not only is there expense of food and lodging, but also the anxiety of families waiting, which reduces the interest in participating. It is better to hold it in late spring, March or April, when the weather is warm, everything is thriving, and children are lively, with plenty of time for transportation, so that schools in remote areas can also participate, in order to fully support the Bureau's advocacy of sports. According to this, the children's physical condition and climate are key factors for the joint sports days of primary schools, and it is more appropriate to hold them in the spring. The 179th Bureau Affairs Meeting of this Bureau resolved that elementary school sports days will be held in the spring and secondary school sports days will be held in the autumn from this year onwards. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the school for notification. This order.</p>

<p>Cheng Tianfang Gave a Speech, briefly stating, "Chairman Chen is going to Jiangxi on important business, so I will briefly speak to you. The foundation of education is built on primary schools. If primary schools are run well, then secondary schools can be run well. If secondary schools are good, then universities can be good. I have a few feelings about the current primary school education: (1) Primary school education is supposed to be compulsory, but this is not the case in China now. On the contrary, there is a problem of having too few schools and too many students; (2) There are not enough teachers. This is a common phenomenon everywhere, so we want to find ways to gradually increase rural normal schools; (3) The education industry is separated from the production industry. Often, before students are educated, they can still produce, but after being educated, they become members of the property division and despise working in rural areas. This is a serious and noteworthy issue for the future of Chinese education. Although Jiangsu's education funds are tight, they are relatively rich compared to other provinces. We certainly hope for an increase in education funds, but we must not take it from land taxes again. Rural areas are already on the verge of bankruptcy. Should we help them and maintain them, or should we increase their burden?"</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai's Speech briefly stated, "Today's local education supervision conference is the first of its kind in Jiangsu. Not only in Jiangsu, but also in the entire country, it has never been held before, so whether this conference will have results or achievements has a great impact on the future of education. I hope that you will pay special attention. The important issue of this conference is the mutual exchange of supervision by county supervisors. The key points are: (1) It can eliminate the drawbacks of local revenge and favoritism; (2) It can make supervisors nervous; (3) It can make those being supervised work harder; (4) It can improve the status of county supervisors, expand their powers, and increase their responsibilities. The key points that county supervisors should pay attention to are: (1) Rural textbooks; (2) Music textbooks; (3) Sports textbooks. All of these must have textbooks that promote the national spirit. Finally, I hope that all supervisors will be serious and fair, and not perfunctory."</p>
<p>Cao Chu and Others Gave Speeches At the end, Cao Chu, principal of Zhenjiang Normal School, was appointed as chairman, and Mei Zhaotai was appointed as vice-chairman. Then, Chen Xifang, Xiang Ju, Tan Cao, Cao Chu, and others gave speeches one after another. The meeting was adjourned after taking a photo.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Huang BingKun Discusses the General Situation of Overseas Chinese Education in Southeast Asia <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>A reporter met with Mr. Huang Bingkun, who recently returned from Southeast Asia, at his residence yesterday. Mr. Huang has been teaching in overseas Chinese schools in various parts of Southeast Asia for more than ten years. This time, he brought his family back to his hometown in retirement. He has a good understanding of the situation of overseas Chinese education in Southeast Asia. The details of what Mr. Huang told are as follows: Mr. Huang said that there are many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, especially people from Guangdong and Fujian. In addition to the foreign governments widely establishing schools to accommodate overseas Chinese in order to colonize them, many overseas Chinese who are enthusiastic about education also set up schools themselves. Especially in British and Dutch colonies, there are many overseas Chinese schools. There are already more than two hundred schools in Singapore. All</p>
<p>School Administration　Except for overseas Chinese schools in Siam, which are subject to the constraints of the independent country's education system, other overseas Chinese schools in British, Dutch, and French colonies are independent. The highest administrative body is the board of directors. Most of the school sites are located in the ancestral halls. Guangdong, such as Guangzhao, Chaozhou, Rongshu, and Hainan ancestral halls, and Fujian, such as Zhangzhou, Tongan, and Anxi ancestral halls, have very few buildings. Most of the school directors are businessmen who do not understand education and are too busy with business to care about it. Therefore, they only have a nominal title. Sometimes, conflicts arise due to unclear authority, interfering with teaching affairs, and affecting political school affairs. Although the ancestral government once ordered the consulates in Southeast Asia to concurrently manage</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Education, but the consuls generally regard it as a mere formality. Secondly, overseas Chinese schools are sometimes subject to interference from the government where they reside. For example, the British government promulgated the Overseas Chinese School Registration Ordinance and set up a Chinese inspector. The Siamese government interferes even more severely. All Chinese who serve as principals and teachers must pass the Siamese government's examination. Those who do not understand Siamese are not allowed to be employed. Therefore, the curriculum of each school devotes up to twenty hours per week to Siamese. As for the funding of each school, it used to be more than sufficient. In recent years, affected by the global economic panic, the commercial situation in Southeast Asia has been very sluggish, and funding has gradually become difficult. Moreover, each school has no standard for the distribution of funds, and the budget is also very chaotic, which is not seen in domestic schools.</p>
<p>The Teachers of Each School　Very few are introduced from the country. Most of them are hired through advertisements and value diplomas, regardless of experience and knowledge. The most important thing is Mandarin and calligraphy. If they can speak fluent plain Mandarin, the students will respect them. There is no fixed standard for the curriculum. Generally, more attention is paid to singing and dancing and English. Most of the English teachers are Siamese, and the Chinese teachers are all in charge of one grade. They must teach all subjects, whether it is books or singing. However, the treatment is also becoming increasingly harsh.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Students　Have a patriotic ideology and are happy to listen to explanations of current events in the motherland. However, growing up in the tropics, they are full of energy and often fight in the classroom, are addicted to gambling, and like to eat snacks. Students are not fixed in the schools they attend. The reason is that most of their families are engaged in business and are sometimes rich and sometimes poor, moving from east to west. Therefore, students are registered in the school every week. This is the most difficult thing to handle. In short, overseas Chinese education is currently in a very chaotic state. I hope the government authorities will send personnel to inspect and improve it.</p>

<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>The most taboo thing in the life of a couple is a horizontal shape, because although the horizontal couple life is very harmonious on the surface, and the neighbors don't hear the sound of scolding, the interest in life is definitely not as good as the wavy shape. Therefore, a certain scholar, not my friend, once advocated the theory that "couples should often quarrel, and even fight." His argument is that couples should often quarrel over small things that don't need to be argued about, and they should also quarrel and even fight. After such a big fight, the couple reconciled, and the interest in life at that time was more delicious than before the fight. After that, after a certain period of time, the love between the couple gradually faded, then they had to find another opportunity to play again. This is the so-called wavy couple life, which is the only good way to keep the love between the couple young.</p>
<p>Because of the principle of wavy couple life, I understood the principle of rose with thorns that is supported by people. People's lives are naturally too monotonous and boring. Rich people roll around in their thighs, roll around in wine glasses, and roll around in money eyes. After getting tired of rolling around, they shouted that they would go back to the countryside, or take a walk on the road alone, or live a civilian life for one or two days, and they would feel very comfortable. On the contrary, if a poor boy rolls around in disease, rolls around in life, and rolls around in all the terrors of the times, and can't catch his breath, he will also temporarily forget all the pain and pursue a moment of pleasure to adjust his spirit. Therefore, when miners work in the dark and gloomy underground, they will also hum and compose music, and the dock workers standing under the crane that is enough to destroy their own lives will have to glance at the fully curvy female customers, meditating on everything, and smiling mysteriously. Therefore, most people do not love roses because roses have thorns and are afraid of being stabbed.</p>
<p>People in this society are demanding a large number of roses with thorns, and they need all kinds of wavy lives, 丨丨naturally, not just couple lives, otherwise, everyone will feel monotonous and lonely, and they will curse the emptiness of life even more.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Wu Ziyu Enjoys Spring Lanterns <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng YiMei</p>
<p>General Xing PengLai Wu Ziyu has been living in seclusion in Youyan recently, hiding his whereabouts. People have forgotten his spirit of leading hundreds of thousands of soldiers and drinking horses on the Great Wall. But he is also tired of talking about military affairs, and spends all day writing bamboo and plum blossoms as the only pastime. He opens the window to draw bamboo branches, and the big wind presses the bamboo to worship the plum blossoms. The brokers are deeply interested. It is really rare among today's warriors.</p>
<p>The end of winter and the return of spring, the scenery and customs follow the old, hanging lanterns and banners to decorate the New Year. Wu suddenly had a clear interest, and specially ordered more than 300 various lanterns from the lantern painting shop on the first street of Langfang, all of which were made of thin yarn. Wu has always admired Guan Yu and Yue Fei as people, and specially hired a painter to paint stories such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Legend of Yue on the lantern yarn. Adding colorful colors made it even more brilliant. Guan Yue was even more vividly painted, with a kind of Confucian general demeanor. Once night fell, the lanterns were lit with candles, illuminating the Lantern Festival, as bright as the morning sun. Wu invited many old subordinates and set up a banquet to watch them. The lamplight reflected, and everyone's faces were red. Wu couldn't help but chant the poems of his predecessors: The fiery tree comes out when the feast is held, and the lamp screen surrounds the seat diagonally. He floated three whites in a row. The subordinates knew that the host's interest was soaring, so they flew a note to summon several famous singers to sing a few songs. The pink, white, and black, the jade smile and the pearl frown, under the lamplight, became even more graceful and beautiful. Although Wu belonged to the male Liu Hui from Lu, he did not understand lust on weekdays, but at this time, he couldn't help but feel short of breath and long on affection. After listening to the melodious Wu Ou, he praised it greatly, saying: No wonder the world has the proverb of being born in Suzhou and living in Hangzhou. I deeply regret that I don't have the blessing to visit Suzhou and Hangzhou to see the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains. As he spoke, he drank one cup after another. After the banquet, the guests dispersed, Wu was already so drunk that he could not walk, and was helped into bed by his attendants. The next day, he wrote a poem to record the event, and asked his subordinates to harmonize the chapters. I heard that there were many good poems, but unfortunately I couldn't copy them, otherwise writing them here would also be good material.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Three Kinds of Water Heaters Invented by Design <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>The Hangzhou factory of Sanyou Industrial Company has always used steam heating for dyeing water, which is the same as other dyeing factories. Last year, because Tian Xuwo Sheng went to visit, he said that he had invented a kind of water mouse in the past, which was very clever and could save a lot of time. Therefore, Mr. Chen Wanyun asked him to try to make one for comparison. As a result, 60 pounds of cold water with the same volume can be heated to 80 degrees Celsius in 7 minutes, while the original disc coil can only be heated to 60 degrees, saving time by more than one-third, which is enough to increase work and efficiency by more than 37%. Therefore, he entrusted the Home Industry Cooperative to specially make 38 pieces, which have been completely refitted. According to the description, the reason for the invention is that when ordinary steam is heated, many bubbles float on the water surface, resulting in heat loss, and the ones that escape from the water surface account for more than three-tenths, which can be said to be a waste. Therefore, this device is made by using the principle of vacuum spray. Its shape is like a water mouse in a firecracker, so it is named water mouse. It makes the steam enter from the back and absorb the cold water from the tail end, and spray out from the head end, so that the water rotates and circulates continuously. There are absolutely no bubbles floating on the water surface, so it is very easy to heat. Each cubic foot of cold water is heated to 60 degrees Celsius, no more than three minutes in summer and no more than five minutes in winter. This is just a method, and the materials are very cheap, only five yuan per piece. There is also a "hand-shaped heater", the principle is the same, but its uses are different, because the water mouse can only be used in the water storage tank, while the hand-shaped heater can draw water from the well and transport it to the application site, turning it into hot water continuously. The suction force can reach 20 feet, the blowing force can reach 15 feet, and the horizontal flow can be transported regardless of distance. It can also be branched into two lines in the middle, and the water comes out very quickly. The cost of materials per piece is 25 yuan. If water is taken from the water tower, there is another kind, called "Guo Shanlong", the principle is the same as the water mouse, but a water pipe is connected to the head end, which can transport horizontal flow and branch it to send it far away. It can also adjust the water intake, so that the high temperature can reach 90 degrees Celsius, or reduce the temperature to 30 degrees Celsius to meet the purpose of use. The cost of each piece is only 15 yuan. All three kinds of heaters can be said to be fast and clever, increasing work efficiency a lot. However, the angle is very important when making them. A slight deviation will prevent the water from being sprayed into a mist, which will consume a lot of steam power and damage the coal fire. Therefore, each device must be measured by the inventor himself and pointed out with ink before drilling the hole.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Green Apples and Oranges <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Huai Qu</p>
<p>In recent months, what I have feared seeing most is apples, especially green apples.</p>
<p>Whenever I walked past the door of a fruit store, I would always lower my head or look elsewhere. If I accidentally wasn't careful, and my gaze came into contact with those glossy green apples, they could give me an extremely harsh stimulation.</p>
<p>In the past, among fruits, my favorite to eat was apples. I also loved its glossy green color, which contained the beauty of a maiden. Since getting to know her, her preferences influenced me, making me love green apples even more.</p>
<p>When she was around, what she loved to look at most was everything green, especially that apple-like light green. Her clothing when she was at school was almost inseparable from this green color, year-round. If she happened to buy a few new books, she would also use green paper to wrap the covers.</p>
<p>Not only for apples did she love the green, but also for other fruits, she often didn't mind that they were unripe, and liked to choose the green ones.</p>
<p>I remember during last year's winter vacation, we were both preparing to return to our hometowns. On the Sunday of the week before the vacation, I, along with her brother Dongwei, accompanied her to buy snacks. Dongwei went to the food shop to buy oranges, and she only picked out the green ones.</p>
<p>"What is this?" Dongwei asked in this way.</p>
<p>"I feel very sorry for it! I love its color very much! Alas! This is its innocent color. It doesn't use bright red to entice us, it has no intention of contributing to the outside world! You wicked people, why do you have to pick it off so forcefully!"</p>
<p>She said to her brother with a smile.</p>
<p>Her smile was a smile containing lament!</p>
<p>Afterwards, I jokingly said to her:</p>
<p>"Green oranges, really have no intention of contributing to people? Maybe the time hasn't come yet?"</p>
<p>She lowered her head in thought, and never explained this question to me.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Sharing Wine and Food, Reveling and Bidding Farewell with Tears</p>
<p>Burning the Midnight Oil, Whispering Dreams and Passing the Long Night</p>
<p>Ziqiang slammed the table and said: "So it turns out you have such a great skill, why didn't you say so earlier? Otherwise, these past few days, I would have asked you to sing every day." Guizhi smiled and said: "Do you think I am a theater fanatic? Today is a special situation, that's why I shamelessly started singing." Ziqiang said: "What's so special about today?" Guizhi said: "It's just a farewell dinner for you." Ziqiang smiled and said: "Now I know that when a husband is about to leave home, he can receive special favor from his wife. In the future, I should always leave home." Upon hearing this, the color on Guizhi's face couldn't help but change a little. Ziqiang then explained with a smile: "What I mean by always leaving home is coming back three times a month, so I'll only be leaving home three times a month. Can you also give me a farewell dinner like today?" Guizhi smiled and said: "Just for you to drink two taels of wine and listen to me sing a few lines off-key, it's not worth it, right?" Ziqiang said, "In this world, what's worth it and what's not worth it? It all depends on each person's own assessment. A small diamond, at most, can be worth tens of thousands. May I ask, what's the use of that? As for me, I love to eat roasted sweet potatoes the most. They're sweet, fragrant, and hot, but they only cost a few copper coins, and a person can eat their fill. People in the world don't think much of it, so it can't become anything great. So to speak, good and bad aren't fixed, it all depends on whether people like it or not. I think two taels of wine and a short song are worth me running around a long distance." Guizhi smiled and said: "You're right, I'll sing another short song for you to listen to, to thank you for considering me a confidante." Ziqiang held his cup, tilted his head, and listened outside again, then asked: "What time is it? It sounds like the fourth watch." Guizhi said: "You don't have to worry about that at all. Tonight, we'll just eat a little, drink a little, and have a little fun." (319)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e263">Patriots Never Forget the Sky <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Nanhai Shaou</p>
<p>Using Statistics to Prove the Safety of Aviation</p>
<p>"Riding the wind, how light and ethereal!" I often recall Lie Yukou's fluttering fantasy of ascending to immortality; it's just a pity that I never learned aviation since I was young.</p>
<p>Although the slogan "Aviation to Save the Nation" has been almost sung to the high heavens, in reality, our "Air Force" has not yet left the "national borders" 丨丨our airspace丨丨. Our aviation technicians are very backward in terms of quantity and technology.</p>
<p>"The son of a thousand pieces of gold does not sit under an overhanging eave." "A gentleman does not stand under a crumbling wall,"…These are all intoxicating drugs that cultivate our "fear of death inferiority complex." In the future, we must create a few new slogans, new creeds, such as:</p>
<p>Patriots never forget the "sky"!</p>
<p>Warriors never forget "broken arms"!</p>
<p>Having creeds and slogans alone is not enough to encourage true courage. We must use some method to encourage the general youth's interest in aviation, so that everyone develops a lasting frenzy. Then, using the old phrases to encourage reading, we can hum:</p>
<p>In the "sky" there is a beautiful woman! In the "sky" there is a fast Cloud Pavilion! But this is too ridiculous.</p>
<p>Only by breaking the inferiority complex of "fear of death" can we generate an interest in adventure; so I found some ironclad factual statistics to explain that aviation is safe and not dangerous.</p>
<p>According to Australian aviation statistics, in the past five years,</p>
<p>Aviation route 9,901,431 miles</p>
<p>Number of passengers carried 250,582</p>
<p>Number of deaths in accidents 32</p>
<p>Number of injuries in accidents 21</p>
<p>On average, one person dies in an accident every 225,000 miles of flight, and one person is injured every 210,000 miles.</p>
<p>In 1930, public aviation flew 598,000 miles, carrying 7,835 passengers, without any accidents. Regular aviation flew 759,000 miles, carrying 8,096 passengers, with one accident, killing one pilot and injuring one bystander.</p>
<p>According to statistics at the end of last year,</p>
<p>In the United States, on average, one person dies in an accident every 900,000 miles of flight. In the United Kingdom, one person dies every 100,000 miles. In France, one person dies every 1,490,000 miles.</p>
<p>This slight danger is really nothing compared to tigers hurting people in the city.</p>
<p>Airplanes are much safer than cars.</p>
<p>According to the 1930 British car (motorcycle) injury statistics:</p>
<p>Number of accidents 156,793</p>
<p>Number of deaths 7,305</p>
<p>Number of injuries 177,895</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, flying by plane is much safer than riding in a car. Why do ordinary people always see riding in a car as a mundane thing, and flying in a plane as an adventurous thing?</p>
<p>The driving of motorcycles, in addition to the problems that may occur with the vehicle itself, has many obstacles on the road, and dangers can occur at any time, so the tragic accidents of car crashes are commonplace. As for airplanes, there are no utility poles or trees in the sky, nor are there people. Rising and falling, moving forward, backward, left, right, up, and down, can all be done freely. In addition to the occasional problems that occur with the vehicle itself and the changes in the weather, it can be said that there are no other obstacles. Based on the usual assumptions, it is much safer.</p>
<p>Number of passenger planes in various countries in recent years</p>
<p>Therefore, civil aviation in various countries is rapidly seeking to compete with ships and trains for seats.</p>
<p>Country Number of planes Number of passengers Note</p>
<p>UK...34...45,150...Full year 1932</p>
<p>France...259...26,893...Same as above</p>
<p>Italy...82...43,300...Same as above</p>
<p>Germany...178...98,489...Same as above</p>
<p>Netherlands...43...21,020...Same as above</p>
<p>United States...544...248,954...First half of 1933</p>
<p>Looking at these facts and clear numbers, it can be proven that "Is aviation dangerous? It is not dangerous!" Here, I respectfully wish "the nation that fears death" everyone "a stubborn man has integrity! A cowardly man has ambition!"</p>

<h3 id="e264">Silver Prices and Exchange Rates Rebound While the Gold Market Remains Weak Throughout the Day <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Decline of Six Yuan and Three Jiao</p>
<p>Banks Forcefully Purchase Large Quantities of British Exchange</p>
<p>March Futures Also Drop Two Yuan and Six Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market saw a decline yesterday. The market situation was mediocre, and sentiment was weak. The situation within the market was bleak, and trading was sluggish, presumably because hedging was not very active. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in London and the United States both rebounded. The forward silver price on the Precious Metals Exchange rose by 3.3 to 4.4 li. Exchange rates also increased. London raw gold rose by eight pence, American cotton rose by ten points, and American wheat rose slightly. The raw price opened at 39 yuan in the morning, with Xie Kang, Dadecheng and Lai Jin pushing it up to 43 yuan. After opening, it declined because the exchange market seemed loose. However, it rose again at one point because the banks had a strong appetite. Sentiment was quite weak. Foreign dispatches also reported that Biddleman's plan to raise silver prices had not changed, but it still fell, but only in very small waves. Later, the market loosened again after news came from the Seattle night market that silver futures were rising. It then broke the 40-yuan mark. However, it rebounded again because the banks were still forcefully buying American exchange. The closing price was still within 40 yuan. March's standard gold price has already broken the 700-yuan mark because the banks are forcefully buying shillings. The naked gold price is 957 yuan and 5 jiao. The market situation for today is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening (for April futures) was 942 yuan and 4 jiao, a decrease of 3 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the previous close. The spot price opened at 2 yuan and 2 jiao. The exchange market's morning opening price for near-term sales was 1 shilling and 4.5 pence for British exchange and 34 yuan and 9375 for American exchange. Although Xie Kang was buying, the exchange market stiffened because 6-month American gold was difficult to sell at 4375. Yuan Mao, Yongrui, and Kang Tuo pushed the spot price down to between 2 and 1 jiao, but it struggled quite a bit. After entering, it was learned that HSBC's listed price was flat for British exchange but only rose by 25 for American exchange. Hengtai, Dingtai, Qianchang, Xiang, Dadecheng, Xie Kang, Yongfeng, Shengda, Yuanheng and others jointly purchased futures. Shanghai bought 6-month American gold for half a yuan, and Huabi resold it for 4375, rising to 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Yifeng Yongtuo sold it, lowering it to 2 yuan and 3 jiao. However, it rose to 3 yuan and 8 jiao because Mitsui bought 4-month American gold for 125, and Yuan Mao and Yongjin bought futures. Datong then came to supply American exchange. Yifeng, Yongyuanheng, Wanxing, Chunyuan, Yongdeng and others jointly supplied futures, but there were not many transactions. Retail investors such as Hongkang Yong and others suddenly came to forcefully sell. Mitsui sold 6-month American gold for 4375, then lowered it to 1 yuan and 2 jiao. Zhengjin ate 6-month half a yuan. The situation was mostly bearish. Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang Natiao gradually rebounded to 2 yuan and 9 jiao. Hengyu and others were still selling. Trading had quieted down. After hovering, the afternoon close was 941 yuan and 9 jiao, and the spot price was拍 2 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 942 yuan and 1 jiao. The spot price opened at 2 yuan and 2 jiao. The situation in the upper market was flat. Then, news came from foreign dispatches that the night market silver price had risen by 39 points. Hengyu, Hengtai, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, Zhifengyong, Tianfeng Yongyongde and others jointly sold futures, retreating to 39 yuan and half a jiao. Fuyu, Yuanmao, Yongyuanchang Yongnatiao, the bank was still buying, rising to 0 yuan and 4 jiao. Yuankang, Xiangruikang, Hengtai Shunmao Zhengchang Qianchangxiang sold futures, and it fell again to 38 yuan and 6 jiao. HSBC bought 4-month American gold for 3125. Fuchang, Yida Yongheng Yuanyuanmao trended lower, entering at 40 yuan and 2 jiao. Tianfeng Yongshengda sold again. Mitsui came out with 3-month American gold 121, and it fell again to 39 yuan and 1 jiao. Huabi ate 4-month American gold 3125. The situation was still stable. After hovering, the closing price was 93 yuan and 3 jiao. After the close, Zhifeng Yongwan Hengtai all went in, and it rose to over 40 yuan. The spot price was 40 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 943 yuan and 8 jiao, and the lowest was 938 yuan and 6 jiao, a difference of 5 yuan and 2 jiao. As a result, it closed 6 yuan and 3 jiao lower than the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 34 yuan and 375, with HSBC Bank Meifeng listing a long 25, which is equivalent to a standard gold price of over 1006 yuan. (March is still calculated at 711 yuan with the shilling unchanged.) In terms of the closing price, it is about 67 yuan less, 1 yuan less than the previous close. The amount registered this month is 711 yuan in March, 701 yuan in March, and 942 yuan in April. 711 yuan was added in the morning, and 709 yuan was added in the afternoon. The naked gold price is 957 yuan and 5 jiao. The formal transaction in the market was 300 taels sold by Yingfeng Heng to the Tianjin gang in the morning, priced at 958 yuan. In the afternoon, the Tianjin gang sold to colleagues in the same industry for 956 yuan and 5 jiao and 957 yuan. The total transaction volume in the morning and afternoon was more than 1,000 taels. There are 6,433 futures left for February.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat. In total, Wanxing, Shengda, Yifeng, Yongrui Kang, Xiexing Yonghengtai, Yida Yongyongde, Yuanmao Yuanheng, Dachang Xiangyicheng and others were on the selling side. Yuanmao Yongfuchang, Fuyu Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang Xiekang and others were on the buying side. Yuanchun Yicheng Zhifeng Yong first advanced and then exited. Hengyu Dafayong Xianghe Yuanheng first exited and then advanced. The Dalian gang Wanxing made a total of more than 1,400 futures, netting out more than 300 futures. Shunli made a total of more than 300 futures, netting in 7 futures. The Guangdong gang Shengda released more than 400 futures and entered more than 100 futures. Hengxing's transactions were fragmented. As of today, there are a total of 9,651 April chips. The total number of transactions today was 17,927 in the morning and 12,523 in the afternoon. In total, there were 36 bulls and 51 bears.</p>
<p>The March opening was 700 yuan and 8 jiao, a decrease of 1 yuan compared to the previous close. Zhengchang and others limited the market and wanted to advance. Futaiheng Yuanchangyong and others bought in one after another, gradually rising. HSBC's listed price did not move for shillings. Hengyu and others later entered 2 and a half yuan. The spot price Yicheng Yuanheng and the Dalian gang and others took advantage of the high price to continuously supply, and then fell back to 1 yuan. Qingfayong slightly advanced, and then rose to 1 and a half yuan. The afternoon close was 701 yuan and 4 jiao. Later, transactions were rare. Hengxing Yuanheng sold as soon as the market opened, and Sida bought 49 futures. The opening price was 701 yuan. Then, as the shilling strengthened, Hengyu Dafengheng and others supplied it and broke the 700-yuan mark, retreating to 699 yuan and 4 jiao. Fuyu slightly advanced, slightly improving. However, British banks were forcefully buying, and the process was extremely loose. The market then lacked buyers and trended downward, presumably because the sellers were eager to supply. The closing price was 699 yuan and 2 jiao, but Huiyuan wanted to sell at 9 jiao but failed. It will presumably drop to 9 jiao after the close. It was found that the highest price during the day was 702 yuan and a half, and the lowest was 699 yuan and 2 jiao, a difference of 3 yuan and 3 jiao. As a result, it fell 2 yuan and 6 jiao compared to the previous close. The total number of chips as of today is 22,281. In total, there are 32 bulls and 47 bears.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar market situation was loose and stable throughout. The division market still opened with white loans. First, white divisions were made on the heads of the lines, and then there were two to three percent prices. However, the market was closed during the noon market, so this division market price was made in the small general meeting. In terms of division ticket transactions, about 2 million was transferred in the early market, and more than 400,000 in new transactions. The noon market was closed as usual and there were no transactions. About 500,000 were made in the small general meeting. Bank collections, foreign banks collected more than 1.2 million in ticket funds, and various goods and remittance pledges collected more than 3 million. 200,000 was put into storage. Silver funds have stopped receiving and paying, so most of them are probably collected in silver dollar funds. Chinese banks collected more than 2 million in ticket funds, and various goods and remittance tax pledges collected more than 2.3 million. 400,000 was taken out of storage. Japanese banks collected more than 1.5 million in ticket funds, and various goods and remittance funds collected more than 1.4 million. 300,000 was taken out of storage. Money houses received 19.67 million in foreign public orders, and more than 1.4 million in foreign division funds. Various remittance funds amounted to more than 300,000, and more than 20,000 in cash was collected. Also, the total exchange amount of the Shanghai Clearing House on the 22nd was 4,592,283 yuan, 6 jiao and 4 fen, including 2,967,718 yuan, 4 jiao and 5 fen in silver dollars, and 1,624,565 yuan, 1 jiao and 9 fen in remittance silver dollars.</p>

<p>Except for Disarmament, All Show New High Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was the last day of February futures. Although the market had many shorts and longs vying for position, the short squeeze was ultimately the most severe. Except for the fact that the price of disarmament slightly loosened due to the squeezing relationship, the rest continued to reach new high prices. Sentiment was strong, and there were too many shorts, and they were already at the end of their rope. Because there were no goods to deliver, they had no choice but to painfully cut losses or roll over. The disarmament category was known to be difficult to short, so the longs were crowded. Those without real strength had no choice but to roll over at the market price. As a result, all categories were good, except for disarmament, which was weak. When the market opened in the morning, there were a lot of small short coverings and short rollovers. Number 50 bought quite a bit. Market prices rose uniformly by 1 or 2 jiao to about half a yuan. Disarmament was slightly weak due to long rollovers, down by 1 or 2 jiao. At the close, Numbers 11 and 16 sold or rolled over quite a bit, while Numbers 5, 26, and 50 were still needed. Scattered retail investors were still enthusiastically buying. Market prices mostly continued to increase by 2 or 3 jiao. Among them, the consolidated disarmament was slightly better. In the end, except for disarmament, which was slightly lower by 3 jiao and 5 fen, the rest continued to increase by 1 or 2 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. Today is only doing one month of March futures, and the market has not yet shown any loopholes. The total transaction volume was 17,871,000 yuan, including 11,000 yuan in spot goods, 5,380,000 in unified salt tax futures, 1,715,000 in disarmament stores, 1,535,000 in 19 customs duties, 3,190,000 in 20 coils and 20 customs duties, 3,465,000 in short gold six, 2,060,000 in long gold nine six, and 620,000 in 18 customs duties and consolidated disbursements.

<p>A report from the Sin Fung Foreign Firm states that on the 21st, sentiment in the New York securities market was quite unsettled. This was due to New York Central Railroad's plan to issue bonds, with stock conversion valued at $40, leading to a large sell-off of the stock. Simultaneously, criticism was voiced by Mr. Flattau regarding promotional efforts by the exchange. However, in the final hour, market conditions improved due to strong technical positions and favorable industrial and commercial news. Silver mining stocks were very firm, and bonds were mixed, slightly higher. Total daily trading volume was 1.9 million shares. The "Wheat" Relief Association began purchasing 15 million bushels of wheat and has already begun purchasing flour. Continued rain in the Southwest may cause further declines, which could trigger new buying. Regarding "Cotton," there are still general objections to the government's agricultural statistics. However, the Punkha case may be passed in some form. The market situation is influenced by Washington politics, creating an unclear situation. Inland supply is increasing, but prices are still very high. Yarn is calm.</p>

<p>Selling Pressure Still Seen When Market Rises</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon, but the overall situation is still developing. Some factories are determined to receive goods, but the idea of creating new long positions is still weak due to oversupply. When the market rises, selling pressure reappears. However, in general, the market has the potential to stabilize.</p>
<p>Standard Bidding is in Progress The standard bidding market opened with a rise in American cotton and a good continuation of the previous day's momentum. Short covering occurred, with prices rising by one to one and a half yuan across all months. In the afternoon, rumors circulated of spot selling, causing prices to fall by one to one and three-tenths of a yuan. Total daily trading volume was estimated at 30,000 bales. Sales included 1,500 bales from Tongfu, 2,050 bales from Dafeng, 850 bales from Dachang, 650 bales from Senkang, 1,800 bales from Renfeng, and 750 bales from Taichang. Purchases included 3,500 bales from Ruid, 2,250 bales from Gengfeng, 1,250 bales from Dafu, 650 bales from Xincheng, and 400 bales from Suilong. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Increase Compared to Previous Days Current yarn sales are more active than before. It is estimated that various groups purchased a total of 1,445 bales throughout the day. Prices are slightly firm. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market initially rose and then leveled off, but the market atmosphere is relatively firm. A certain factory purchased a large quantity of this month's goods, with deliveries totaling approximately 24,500 dan. The final market price was firm at 42 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, which is 5 jiao and 5 fen higher than last month's price. However, sellers continued to release additional quantities. The future outlook depends on the fluctuations of foreign cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Flourishing The Zheng Standard market opened with a rise of 1.5 to 2.3 jiao, following foreign cotton. In the afternoon, as this month was the last day, prices rose by 5 fen compared to the morning session, while prices for later months fell by 1.2 jiao. Total daily trading volume was estimated at 143,600 dan.

<p>Shareholder Group Primarily Wants to Replace Brokers, Facing Opposition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been arguing about the standard reform issue for a long time, and it has not been resolved. Both sides have gone to extremes. Yesterday, the brokers' side convened a general meeting to discuss everything. As a result, the majority still agreed to use Ren Zhong yarn as the standard. However, according to market rumors, the shareholder group is doing its utmost to advocate for changing to Golden Rooster yarn as the standard, preparing to list and open trading on March 1, with simultaneous operations for the May, June, July, August, and April contract months. However, according to news from the brokers' side, if new standard yarn is used, they intend to refuse all transactions as a form of resistance. What will actually happen remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market initially rose due to good news from Liverpool and purchases by spot traders. Later, it weakened as some long positions were closed. As a result, spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures prices rose by 7 to 10 points. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices rose by 3 to 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 4 points. In the Bombay cotton market, prices rose due to slight purchases by European exporters and purchases of spot goods by Japanese traders. As a result, Pinggar remained unchanged, Oomra rose by half a rupee, and Bairaokee rose by 2.5 jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 21st).</p>

<p>Borrowing Wheat Until 4 Yuan 1 Jiao</p>
<p>After the flour market opened last year, prices for all contract months fell across the board. Quotations for foreign wheat fluctuated very little, with a difference of about 4 fen. Therefore, the market was initially stable. However, major factories, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, continued to release supplies, and distant contract months were constantly being offered. It was rumored that the government was borrowing wheat at 4 yuan and 1 jiao, but no one accepted it. It is estimated that the factories would only consider 4 yuan and 5 fen, or perhaps have an intention to import. However, Fuxin had already contracted for a ship of Argentine wheat at a price of only 4 yuan and 1.5 jiao. As a result, the market was dominated by selling pressure, with trading volume reaching over 400,000 bags, of which factory holdings accounted for about 200,000 bags. With the steady decline in foreign wheat prices, customer sales remained limited. Further declines are likely in the future. The current month is still one jiao away, but months after March have all fallen below the one jiao threshold. As a result, the current month fell by 2.5 fen compared to the previous day, March and April fell by 2.75 fen, May fell by 2 fen, and June and July fell by 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Small Factories Tend to Purchase Wheat for the Current Month <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices for all contract months showed a slow and steady decline. Quotations for foreign wheat fluctuated very little. Although the current month is close to delivery, and the prices of foreign wheat continue to decline, in theory, there should be few positive factors. However, it is rumored that small factories are quite interested in purchasing the current month's standard. Therefore, although trading volume is small, the market is supported. Trading in distant contract months is also not very active. However, with continued transactions of current foreign wheat, although the decline is small, the market sentiment is generally weak. As a result, the current month rebounded by 4 fen, March by a small 2 fen, and April by a small 2 fen. July had already crossed the 3 yuan threshold and fell to 2 yuan and 9.5 jiao, a drop of 5 fen. The current wheat market has little trading, and prices are trending flat and soft. The opening price for Bengbu wheat is 3 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen, and the price for Yaowan wheat is 3 yuan, 3 jiao, and 9 fen, with an estimated 500 bags purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Hokkien group was still actively purchasing Xiangxian rice. Local shops continued to inquire, and just as sentiment was turning positive, cargo owners suddenly devalued their prices in an attempt to unload. Furthermore, all cargo owners wanted to clear their inventory. Because current inventories are very large, in addition to the new arrivals at the end of last winter, cargoes loaded during the New Year can arrive within days. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, the market was oversupplied. After the market opened, prices for all grades of Xiangxian rice fell across the board, especially for Hunan red brown rice, which had a large inventory. The price suddenly dropped by 2 jiao. Other mid-grade and lower grades of rice also fell by a small amount of jiao. High-grade rice also fell by a small 5 fen. Hunan red brown rice opened at 5 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen, with an estimated 2,500 bags purchased by the Hokkien group. Also, 150 bags of cleaned rice were purchased at 6 yuan. Jiangxi late-season milled rice sold 373 bags at 7 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2 to 4 fen. Beijing brown rice sold 175 bags at 5 yuan and 6 jiao. Quanzhou Nanjing milled Xian rice sold 2,000 bags at 6 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 to 5 fen. Guangzhou milled red rice sold 100 bags at 6 yuan and 8.5 jiao. Local shops purchased 700 bags of Hunan milled oil rice at 7 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen, and 200 bags of milled rice at 6 yuan and 5 jiao. Jiangxi early-season milled rice sold 48 bags at 5 yuan and 9 jiao. No other transactions were reported.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various groups was particularly scarce, with only about a dozen arrivals. The Hokkien group's appetite was also weak, with a total of 700 to 800 bags brought in by the Northern and Southern Oceans groups. Local shops also have fewer storage, so the market is showing a soft trend. Prices for Jiangsu and Zhejiang groups' Nangang and other japonica rice, as well as Qinghong Songjiang late rice, have all fallen by 2 to 3 fen. Changzhou japonica rice is out of stock. Du Yangjian and various other grades are either lacking in stock or have few sales, leaving the market unsettled.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 15 or 16 boats of river rice arrived. Sales by various groups in the market were very sluggish. Prices for japonica rice, thin rice, and early rice have fallen by a small amount of jiao. Prices for Yangjian and Dujian have been reduced by several fen. Prices for Baiyuan and Yinyuan are stable. Kejian is flat and weak.</p>

<p>The tung oil and beeswax industry is a small one. The largest firms only have annual sales of 500,000 to 600,000, while ordinary firms only have 200,000 to 300,000. The entire market only has seven or eight firms. Three or four firms consider tung oil as their main business and beeswax as their secondary business, while another three or four firms consider beeswax as their main business and tung oil as their secondary business. Although they belong to the same industry, their focus is slightly different. The main use of tung oil is for candle making, with soap making as a secondary use. However, in recent years, the amount used in soap making has increased significantly, almost surpassing the amount used in candle making. Furthermore, soap factories trade in whole numbers, while candle sales are in smaller amounts. Therefore, soap factory transactions can stimulate a price increase, which is always noticed by the general public. However, soap making does not necessarily require tung oil. Butter, coconut oil, and other oils can also be used, so one can choose the cheaper option. Candle making, on the other hand, requires tung oil. Last year, because butter and coconut oil were cheaper than tung oil, the market for tung oil inevitably declined, and local firms did not have as much business as in previous years. Beeswax relies entirely on customer sales, with candle merchants being secondary. In the past, sales to Guangdong were the largest, but they have also declined recently. Other groups in Shandong and Yantai are very small, so beeswax sales have also gradually declined. Although both tung oil and beeswax are necessary for candle making, the sales of candle shops are no longer comparable to those in previous years. Therefore, firms' business is inevitably affected. It is also heard that customer accounts overdue for the new year are quite numerous. Making a profit is not easy. The various firms have a solid foundation, so profits and losses can be adjusted. Even if a profit is announced, it is unlikely to be the actual result for the year. If you ask about the actual profit or loss, those who are engaged in this business may not be able to give a definite answer, let alone a superficial investigation by a reporter. The market conditions, inventory, and estimated spring prices at the time of the year-end closing are roughly reported below. The closing price in Hankou was 17 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen per stone for heavy Jing, 16 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen for branch heavy, 16 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen for flat Jing, 17 yuan per dan for Chashe oil, 16 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen for Front Row Jianma, and 15 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen for Tianjin oil. The spring market has not yet opened, but it is predicted that 6 to 7 jiao can be added. The inventory of heavy Jing, flat Jing, Branch Jiang, Tianjin, Chashe, and others are each about 1,000 to 2,000 pieces. There are about 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of Macheng oil. Because the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is low in winter, the supply is weak, and the inventory is also thin. When the spring water rises, the arrivals will definitely surge, and the market will definitely change at that time. The closing price in this port was 20 yuan and 8 jiao per stone for heavy Jing, 20 yuan for flat Jing, 19 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen for Tianjin, and 18 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen per dan (local scale) for Macheng oil. The opening spring price is 21 yuan and 8 jiao per stone for heavy Jing, 20 yuan for flat Jing, 19 yuan and 4 jiao per dan for Chashe, and 19 yuan for Macheng, an increase of about 1 yuan compared to the closing price. The total inventory in the market is about 2,000 to 3,000 pieces. After the closing of accounts, about 1,000 pieces were borrowed and loaded from Hankou. The customer goods were all sold out at the end of the year and need to be awaited. Furthermore, news from Kuozhou is that the spring market opened at 15 yuan and 6 jiao per stone for Tilan, 21 yuan for Neiping, and 12 yuan and 4 jiao for Xiaoxi. Jiaxing local truck oil is 20 yuan per dan (local scale), which has also increased slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Piece Goods: Great Progress in the Wool Fabric Market <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the wool fabric market has made great progress. After the market opened, prices were firmer than in previous years, and sales of various goods were wide. Although arrivals were crowded and Japanese goods were abundant, the trend is still active. Currently, in addition to plaid gabardine and plain serge, a large amount of general woolen fabrics have been offered. Especially, the sales price of green tribute cloth and woolen herringbone overcoat cloth are selling well. Therefore, traders are optimistic, predicting that customers will start buying soon and that sales of spring goods will start, and that the market will make even more progress.</p>

<p>Local Situation: In recent days, factories have completed dozens of transactions, offering over 1,000 boxes. Customer group interest has also been good, and the market conditions are unusually buoyant. The opening price for 90-pound American goods is 16 yuan, and double-linked is 31 yuan and 5 jiao. 100-pound American goods are estimated at 18 yuan, and double-linked is also offered at 35 yuan. There are no spot English goods on the market, so there is no quotation to report.</p>
<p>Incoming New York Goods Reported Higher: Yesterday's telegram reported that prices for each box have risen. 90-pound goods opened at 4 gold yuan and 4.5 jiao, and 100-pound goods opened at 4 gold yuan and 6 jiao. Deduct 2.5 jiao each for those without iron orders. 90-pound double-linked goods without iron orders opened at 8 gold yuan and 2.7 fen, and 100-pound goods opened at 9 gold yuan and 1.8 fen, an increase of 1 to 2 jiao. It is heard that local colleagues have made some deals.</p>
<p>Berlin Telegram Also Raised Prices: Yesterday's telegram reported 34 shillings for 90-pound double-linked, an increase of 3 shillings, and 36 shillings for 100-pound, also an increase of 2 shillings. Colleagues have not made any transactions.</p>

<p>Since the British silk weaving industry implemented restrictions on the consumption of Japanese silk, the price of dried Huizhou raw silk initially soared due to increased factory purchases. Grade A Xiu Lin Flying Horse brand rose to 7 shillings and 5 pence per pound, and Grade B Black Lion brand rose to 7 shillings and 3 pence, each up 3 pence. Subsequently, due to repeated declines in silk prices in the New York and Penang markets, the price of Huizhou silk fell back 3 pence.</p>

<h3 id="e303">University Students Dancing <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Li</p>
<p>The patrons of Shanghai's dance halls, besides the semi-gentlemen who are busy with social affairs, are mostly university students. Some university students even indulge in the melodies of music all night, spending money lavishly, and during the day they simply wander in a dreamlike state, and attending classes is completely irrelevant to them. On Saturday nights, dance halls are open until dawn, and it is said that some diligent students who have classes the next day still go to dance halls to dance that night. I once discussed this issue with friends, and some people advocated that university authorities should strictly prohibit university students from going to dance halls, and expel those who violate the rules. The method would be to send personnel to investigate specifically, and take action immediately upon discovery. However, some people believed that if a certain university president strictly enforced this method, it would definitely cause a disturbance, and the president would feel uneasy in their position. The best solution would be to hold tea dances on Sundays on campus, on the one hand, only allowing dancing on campus and prohibiting reckless behavior outside of campus, and on the other hand, setting a high entrance fee, at least ten yuan per ticket, just like the government's prohibition of opium, to achieve prohibition through taxation. However, some people also believed that this type of legislation would not only fail to prohibit university students from dancing, but might even educate the entire student body to dance, which would be harmful and not beneficial. The best solution would be to announce that students who want to enter dance halls to dance are not violating any rules, but should simply pay a dance prohibition fee of a certain amount each semester (it could be as high as one hundred yuan or more), which would be a legal action of achieving prohibition through taxation.</p>
<p>Modernized life, in Shanghai, can be considered to have been imitated to the peak, and the dancing life of university students, especially, is proof of the harm of imitating modernity. We Chinese do not imitate the content of other people's modernity, but we prefer to learn their modern appearance. This is a matter related to the future destiny of the nation, not just a trivial matter of life. Although dancing has "existed since ancient times" in China, it has long been lost. It was only after the imperialists invaded our Chinese market that dancing was brought along with them. At first, it was just the blue-eyed foreigners opening up venues and dancing themselves, but later it was learned from the upper-class Chinese, to the point that now anyone who is willing to spend three and a third cents to dance once is intoxicated and crazily modernized. (Now there are even dance halls offering a big discount of three and a third cents for two dances to attract customers.) The purpose of university students entering school is to study knowledge in order to pursue advanced studies and serve society after graduation. Now, instead of studying knowledge, they go to dance. This phenomenon is certainly enough to prove that university education has become a problem, but it can also be predicted in advance that these university students who prioritize dancing over attending classes will definitely become parasites who do not engage in production and only enjoy happiness when they reach society. People who are concerned about the world should take this as a concern!</p>
<h3 id="e304">New Year on the Road <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Jiong</p>
<p>The sky was gradually darkening, blurring, and the evening scene appeared even more like a beautiful painting. A round red sun hung obliquely in the sky, far away, bidding farewell to our eyes, reflecting a huge, piercing light; the branches stood still without swaying, like desolate maidens, harboring endless thoughts.</p>
<p>The clock had just struck three in the afternoon, there was no biting cold wind, and the weather felt warm; alone, in order to reduce the annoyance of being confined to this small room all day and some of the stifling atmosphere, I carelessly threw on an old, indescribable overcoat, casually got dressed, and ran out onto the road, hoping to vent the loneliness of sitting at home!</p>
<p>The straight road seemed to carry the desolate scene of autumn. Night was falling, and everything was shrouded in a faint, smoky coat. In a quiet mood, I quietly and silently strolled across one road and turned to another, cycling forward like this, not knowing where I would end up? I nervously pondered in my heart, constantly pondering like this.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual hustle and bustle of the street, the passing pedestrians seemed even more crowded! Large baskets of food and fruit were heavily hanging in everyone's hands, and some, sitting in rickshaws, had their purchases placed on the rickshaw. Ah! So it's the Lunar New Year! Strangers walking behind me cheered to each other.</p>
<p>The more I walked, the lighter I felt than before, using swift steps, constantly moving forward. In this quiet realm, my mind was free from worries like tangled silk threads, only feeling that in the faint, misty wisps of black smoke, everything was blurred, dim, and unclear!</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year has arrived again, how easily the year has passed! Hasty, muddled, I have passed another year-end. At this time, in theory, shouldn't I enthusiastically celebrate this New Year and hold a grand ceremony to commemorate it? Who would have thought that I would feel powerless and only experience the New Year on the road?</p>
<p>In the dim sky, there appeared layers of chasing gray clouds; after several hours of wandering, I now felt too tired to struggle forward. I stopped walking, turned around, and returned home, where it was already dusk illuminated by lights.</p>
<h3 id="e305">Young Master Writer <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>…The young master writer's surname and given name are unknown,</p>
<p>Because the writer's demeanor is close to that of a "young master",</p>
<p>So everyone calls him "Young Master Writer"…</p>
<p>Closing the door, he turned around in a foxtrot style, looked at the stationery on his writing desk, arranged with original manuscript paper printed with his name, Waterman ink, a Parker pen, Wasp brand cigarettes, and a glass of white milk… He thought to himself:</p>
<p>"Such a good environment! Let's write!"</p>
<p>He sat in the swivel chair, took a sip of milk, and lit a cigarette; pulled the manuscript paper straight, and picked up the pen... What should I write?</p>
<p>He put down the pen, and again drank milk and smoked a cigarette.</p>
<p>"What should I write? Write a novel? Too troublesome! No; write a poem! Yes! Writing a poem will make me a poet; "poet," such an elegant term! Miss Wang said I have a talent for writing poetry; hey! I have a talent for writing poetry."</p>
<p>The young master writer shrugged his shoulders, loosened his tie, and picked up the pen... It's really hard to find a subject for a poem!</p>
<p>The nib of the Parker pen circled a few times on the edge of the manuscript paper, but the paper remained snow-white, because the nib was held high.</p>
<p>"Poetry can't be separated from women: Homer, Shelley, Byron... Whose poems don't mention women?"</p>
<p>Again, he drank milk and smoked a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Yes! I have to write about women!"</p>
<p>So, the ink marks jumped onto the manuscript paper following the young master writer's thoughts:</p>
<p>Woman, my baby!</p>
<p>After writing it, he recited it once and felt that it had no rhythm at all, no good! A poem must have a kind of charming rhythm… Great, I have a way, it's so simple! Just add one word:</p>
<p>Woman!</p>
<p>My baby oh!</p>
<p>The young master writer recited it again, and a smile bloomed on his face like a flower; this "oh" word, how affectionate! No, this whole line.</p>
<p>Picking up the milk glass, he didn't notice that the milk was gone.</p>
<p>"Haha!" The young master writer seemed to suddenly realize, the vision of a great man blazed in his thoughts... There was once a great inventor Watt, no! It was probably Newton, um, perhaps not Newton either; it must have been Franklin! Um, it doesn't seem like Franklin either, never mind! In any case, he was a great inventor; didn't he once boil a watch as an egg? How is it that I didn't even know the milk glass was empty! Haha, this is a symbol, a symbol!</p>
<p>The young master writer was very excited, and so the poem came gushing out of his mind:</p>
<p>Woman oh!</p>
<p>I don't see you for a day!</p>
<p>I'm going to die in a day!</p>
<p>He put down the pen again, and recited it again: "The tone is really beautiful! The emotion is really intense! Of course! I have a talent for writing poetry!"</p>
<p>The cigarettes in the tin were gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>"Keep writing! I must write a full "eight lines":"</p>
<p>Woman oh!</p>
<p>I miss you,</p>
<p>I miss you like!</p>
<p>"Like what? Like "being thirsty"! No, too vulgar! Like "waiting to be fed"! Not good either! The words "waiting to be fed" are "classical Chinese", ha! Outdated "classical Chinese, get out of here"!</p>
<p>I miss you like a butterfly loving a flower room!</p>
<p>"Excellent!" The young master writer was excited to the boiling point, he thought such a line of poetry was really rare!</p>
<p>"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, enough, this precious "eight-line poem"!"</p>
<p>He threw down the pen, and happiness bubbled in his heart like many bubbles; he wanted to smoke another cigarette, but there were no cigarettes left either; so, he laughed again, and thought of Watt, Newton, Franklin...</p>
<h3 id="e306">Then, let's go find country girls! <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Shuo</p>
<p>My friend K, is such a funny person! At times he has a completely fresh mind, but at other times he is so pedantic as to make one nauseous. When he opens his fish-like mouth, it's rare for him to close it; but there are times when he's as silent as a cicada in winter. He loves to get close to the beautiful figures of modern ladies, but he says he already has a ten-year-old son. Below is his eulogy to his respected wife, a paean. When you think about it, you can't say he doesn't have his reasons, and the humor lies in this. Let's see:</p>
<p>"Now the general mentality is that new things are good, and things that aren't new are unusable. I think this is a kind of fashionable ailment. I have never opposed the old school of thought. Although new things are emerging every day, old things still have their place. Take marriage, for example. Generally, people think that non-romantic, free marriage is a sinful union. They think that in order to obtain marital happiness, one can only seek it through new-style free love, and that old-style marriage only brings pain. I think this view is very wrong. Because the old itself is not necessarily bad. It's just a matter of application. If applied properly, the old can also produce new happiness. If applied improperly, even the new will show bad signs.</p>
<p>I am a person who had an old-style marriage, and my marriage is the most comical farce described by the new 'Eight-Legged Essayists'. Before the marriage, I had neither seen her nor knew her temperament, let alone her thoughts. People said she was good, the matchmaker said she was good, so my parents also thought she was good and arranged it for me. Soon after the arrangement, I married her. Now I already have two children. What is most surprising is that there is still a strong affection between us, and peaceful happiness still tightly embraces us. She has never uttered a single complaint to me, and I have never felt the need to seek another home. The fact is like this, and I cannot but admit that old-style marriage also has its advantages. And the specific advantages that I feel about my wife are about the following points.</p>
<p>First, is her docility. General poets often praise women for being as docile as lambs, and this is only found in the wives of old-style marriages. As for new-style marriages, don't even dream about it. For example, I can ask my wife to get tea and water, I can ask her to leave me and go to another place, and I can also ask her to stay by my side all day long. What I say is always followed, and there is never any protest or resentment. In front of her, I can fully display the kind of hidden authority that is indispensable to our male dignity.</p>
<p>Second, is her ability to endure hardship. Endurance of hardship is a virtue, and I don't deny it at all. My wife is full of this spirit of enduring hardship. All day long, she not only tidies up the house, but also takes care of the children and washes clothes. In addition, she also has to serve my parents. If it were me, I would get very annoyed. However, she is not annoyed at all, and does not complain at all. Sometimes, even if she is so busy that her legs are weak, as long as I comfort her for a while, she will smile slightly and start working again.</p>
<p>Third, is her gentleness, is her thoughtfulness. This kind of taste is absolutely impossible for people who have not experienced old-style marriage to appreciate. Although the general saying is that only fashionable women understand the charms of women and know how to express the beautiful aspects of a woman's character. However, I firmly believe that only old-style wives can achieve the ultimate in gentleness and thoughtfulness. We know that if we want to appreciate a woman's expression, we often subtly understand it from her quiet gaze and lowered eyebrows. We know that a string of rambling love words is not as moving as a deep gaze. We also know that a mad embrace is not as profound as a silent closeness. The reason for this is that only from a static posture can one appreciate the true meaning of beauty, and only static beauty is the highest form of beauty. Turning to women, I think that the reason why they are able to move people more deeply is in their static beauty. And the only ones who can do this just right are old-style wives. Their silent complaints, deep gazes, and silent smiles, or silent sorrows, are truly touching and endearing.</p>
<p>We know that the reason we get married is to get a kind of comfort of the opposite sex's body and soul. This comfort of flesh and spirit is what people generally call marital happiness. And this kind of happiness isn't necessarily only found in new-style marriages. From my personal point of view, I feel that not only is new-style marriage not the only source of happiness, but it simply doesn't have so-called happiness. What they call love is completely based on whether there is money. If you have a full pocket, she will do her best to please you, but if the money runs out, she will be extremely vicious and then leave you.</p>
<p>I have always been poor, but I have never been forced to suffer by my wife, because old-style wives are better than new-style women, because there is a pure relationship between us. The old is not necessarily all bad. The new is not necessarily a good model. Not thinking like this is the root of the common people's mistakes."</p>
<p>He often spouts this kind of grand theory, trying to persuade his friends, and the result is that he wins everyone's agreement: "Then, let's go find country girls!" Hahaha…　　　　　　　　The End</p>

<h3 id="e307">"Welcoming the God of Wealth" <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>This thoroughly authentic "old brand domestic product" of the "New Year" has finally flowed by quickly for many days amidst the sound of gongs, drums, and firecrackers. But last night (the 17th), very strangely, the sounds of "firecrackers" and "yellow whips" with their "逼, 迫, 窮, 怕 (Bī, pò, qióng, pà; force, urgency, poverty, fear)" sounds continued non-stop all night long. It turned out that yesterday was the so-called "Day of the God of Wealth," so shop owners were enthusiastically "welcoming the God of Wealth"!</p>
<p>Listen! The sharp "逼, 迫 (bī, pò)" sounds of the "yellow whips," the loud "窮, 怕 (qióng, pà)" sounds of the "firecrackers," filled the whole "city night" in a soul-stirring way with the atmosphere of sulfur. Isn't this like the general shop owners, amidst the turmoil of today's world economic panic, loudly making their final, painful cries, begging to their imagined "all-powerful" "God of Wealth Bodhisattva"? And on the tables in every shop, there are all kinds of delicacies, to sincerely offer sacrifices to the "God of Wealth Bodhisattva" after he is moved by the pitiful sounds of "逼, 迫, 窮, 怕 (bī, pò, qióng, pà)" and graces them with his presence. Isn't this trying to "flatter" him with a banquet in the hope that he will bestow "wealth" upon them in abundance?</p>
<p>But think about it, wasn't last year's night the same? Look! Apart from the countless shops that have "closed down" in bankruptcy, there are more than 170 (?) on the most prosperous Nanjing Road in Shanghai alone that have been sued for owing more than six months' rent. So, after gorging himself on the "sincere sacrifices," what "obligations" did this "God of Wealth" fulfill?</p>
<p>I remember a very "humorous" dialogue in a certain novel: "Do you pray every day? Because there are too many people praying, God really has no time to listen to you." Doesn't the fact also tell us that in such a social organization, even if we piously worship this "Bodhisattva" in the store every day, what "divine power" is there to save us from avoiding this danger and "reviving the market" and "prospering Shanghai"?</p>

<h3 id="e308">Domestic Product Year, Factories Use Japanese Goods <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am a very pitiful young worker.</p>
<p>You, sir, seem to be like a merciful saviour to us, and I have great faith in your amateur mailbox.</p>
<p>I now have a very difficult problem to solve, please give me some guidance. What is the problem? It is that the tools used in our factory have always been domestic products, but now it seems that we have sensed the benefits of January 28th [the Shanghai Incident of 1932] and purchased a large batch of Japanese goods, forcing us workers to use them. We also have very good domestic products, and during this domestic product year, we should promote domestic products and recover our rights and interests. This is the way to act for the sake of our countrymen. Moreover, the Japanese are also our enemies. If we use their goods, wouldn't we be sending them money to buy bullets to shoot us? Isn't this painful! Although I do not approve of the factory's actions, if I stop working and resist the factory, my livelihood problem cannot be solved.</p>
<p>You see, in this environment, under the power and oppression, what can I do to resist without working and reason with the factory? Please answer me in the newspaper as soon as possible. Wishing you good health, Cai Tuanjiu bowing. February 1st</p>
<p>Editor's note: This letter was received twenty days ago. When the editor first opened and read this letter, although I had endless feelings about this kind of fact, I still thought that such a frantic "factory" absolutely did not exist. However, later, after thinking about this matter again and again, and recalling the "fake domestic products" case of a certain factory mentioned in the newspaper last year, this kind of fact not only does exist, but is definitely there. If we use correct methods and calm attitudes to analyze the social phenomena of the current society, we can definitely say this.</p>
<p>After reading this letter, readers must be wondering: how could the "factory" be so frantic, and how could the worker be so noble? The "factory's" use of Japanese goods is nothing more than wanting to make more money, but they are people who live comfortably, and earning less money doesn't matter much. They dare to be so shameless and risk the great disapproval of the world. Workers will have no way to make a living if they lose their jobs, and they are doing things for others, and others will definitely not scold them, saying that they should not be doing Japanese goods, but he always doesn't want to, and always wants to reason with the factory. Looking at it this way, isn't there a world of difference in the personality of these two? However, that is not the case, there are other reasons for this.</p>
<p>All Chinese enterprises are now in the hands of imperialism. Although they sometimes want to independently resist, they ultimately cannot escape the palm of the Buddha. Because the only purpose of all enterprises in today's society is "profit." If they violate this purpose and are willing to lose money, then enterprises will not only not be able to exist, but the people who run the enterprises will definitely not have this idea. Therefore, the people who run the enterprises certainly hope that their enterprises can make money on the one hand, and can also seek welfare for the society on the other hand. However, if seeking welfare for the society cannot be achieved, or even harms the society, then as long as their enterprises can make money, they will still run them. Now the world is in economic panic, and everyone is carrying out devaluation and dumping policies. In our country, there are neither strong tariff barriers nor all kinds of unequal treaties. Think about it, how can our enterprises compete with foreigners in this environment? Therefore, it is very difficult for enterprises to exist now, that is, to make money. And doing "fake domestic product" business is not excusable, but there are other difficulties.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the general working people who are exploited and oppressed by the imperialists. As for the above-mentioned entrepreneurs and comprador classes who act as accomplices or shift their suffering to the masses, on the contrary, although they are also unwilling to "rely on others to make their wedding dresses," they can still rely on the imperialists to survive, unlike the general masses who not only cannot rely on them, but are exploited and oppressed to death. Therefore, only the general hard-working masses truly have the indomitable determination to oppose imperialism.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about promoting domestic products. There are two reasons for promoting domestic products now: first, to break the economic chains that imperialists have placed on us, that is, "to resist foreign goods and recover our rights and interests"; second, to seek the development of national economy, thereby making society safe, in other words, to request "national wealth." At first glance, these reasons seem quite sufficient. However, practically speaking, it is already quite difficult to promote domestic products, and it is even more difficult to achieve the first two goals. We have said before that it is not easy for domestic products to compete freely with foreign products, because the sales of "domestic products" must rely on "cheap and good quality," and relying solely on patriotic enthusiasm is useless. Moreover, economic aggression is the only hope of imperialists for colonies and weak nations. Before the colonies have resistance consciousness, they put on a friendly mask and use "commercial competition" policies, but if commercial competition doesn't work, then they are straightforward and use political means to solve it, and airplanes and cannons come all at once. Therefore, imperialists always add many political chains to weak nations, such as our country's unequal treaties, because this is the guarantee of "economic aggression." Therefore, it is also useless for weak nations to use the "promoting domestic products" method to oppose imperialism.</p>
<p>Promoting domestic products can certainly revitalize the national economy, but what we are all praying for day and night now is social peace and prosperity, so the development of the "national economy" must also take whether or not it can achieve these goals as its future. The national economy of the United States is extremely developed, and the country is extremely rich. However, national wealth does not necessarily mean "popular prosperity" (a few "people" are extremely rich, but most people are poor). We only need to see that the United States is still craving "revival" every day, trying to make up for the economic panic, stabilize society, and reduce unemployment, and we can know that whether society is stable and whether people can live well cannot be solved by urgently seeking "wealth," and there is another way to solve it.</p>
<p>Therefore, if "promoting domestic products" is for the sake of seeking welfare for everyone in the society, then not only do we not dare to oppose it (those who oppose it are frantic), but it is something that everyone should pray for sincerely. However, in the current situation, judging from the reasons held by those who promote domestic products, promoting domestic products is no different from those who admired foreign ships and guns decades ago, and only knew to seek "national wealth and military strength"; their abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial is useless to society and the nation in the same way. However, although we feel that the current "promoting domestic products" is not a fundamental solution to the people's livelihood, we do not oppose it, and we hate and detest even more those "factories" who use Japanese goods like that.</p>
<p>What Cai Jun asked and needed was a way to "resist without doing it and reason with the factory," but the editor wrote a lot about the current "promoting domestic products," which is really irrelevant. We really have endless feelings about the occurrence of this kind of fact, and we have to say it; but we still have to talk about the solution. Now let's talk about the solution.</p>
<p>If you can disregard everything, then "resisting without doing it" is no problem at all, and Cai Jun doesn't need to write to this mailbox. What is the problem with resigning? However, if you think that you will have no way to make a living after resigning, and at the same time, the factory will continue to buy and use Japanese goods, then the problem is big, but it is not without a solution; this is both a solution and no solution. Because the center of this problem is whether or not the factory can be persuaded to change its mind, not to move it and make it realize its conscience. So if an individual resists without doing it, there is definitely no solution - the factory is afraid of what you will do alone, it can fire you; however, if everyone is very angry and wants to reason with the factory, then the factory may accept your and your requests because "public anger is hard to offend." Therefore, the solution that the editor can offer Cai Jun is to discuss with colleagues and ask the factory to "stop using Japanese goods."</p>

<p>— Yu Mei</p>
<p>"Ha, she cursed me as a prostitute. Ugh!" This surprise was slight. "People who grew up at the doorstep, who doesn't know who. She talks nonsense about me like this, am I supposed to let her? I brought out the records of her ancestors' prostitution. I said her eldest daughter slept with the big and small bosses of Wu Qiantai. Her second daughter raises illegitimate children, and the third daughter is only sixteen and already pregnant. I chewed her out thoroughly, making the old hag shrink into her turtle shell, not daring to make a sound, and that was the end of it. Ha, aren't you angry?" She looked at the man with a slight smile.</p>
<p>The man stuttered, "Of course. Anyone would vent such frustration."</p>
<p>"Of course," the third sister continued, "I don't usually like to argue with people, but she insisted on picking a fight with me, so I couldn't back down. Now she's back on good terms with me. It's really unbelievable."</p>
<p>"Naturally, naturally." The man lit a cigarette, pretending to listen to her with concern, while calculating something else in his heart.</p>
<p>After a brief pause, the woman found another topic. She asked, "Where did you go this morning?"</p>
<p>"This morning? I didn't go anywhere. Where did you see me?"</p>
<p>"At the entrance of the Anxian Lou teahouse. And there was a person in Western clothes just coming out."</p>
<p>"Oh, that person I nodded to? He's the third boss of Wu Qiantai, studying at Shanghai University. I just went there to mediate a labor dispute for a colleague from Wang Shunxing's company. We settled it at the teahouse."</p>
<p>"Wasn't Wang Shunxing's business doing well last year? Why are they laying people off?"</p>
<p>"Business isn't bad, but it's not great either, right? They cut a lot of people, and several of us managed to keep one person."</p>
<p>"Wang Shunxing's pastries are really good. Little Jade's creations are the best. I don't really like sweet things anymore."</p>
<p>"Didn't you used to have people sending you gifts every day?" the man said, touching the woman's face.</p>
<p>"Too bad you never gave me any!" The woman smiled and lightly kicked the man's leg.</p>
<p>"Then is it too late now?" the man teased, while still smoking.</p>
<p>"You're old, still saying these things." The woman pretended to be serious but smiled, glancing at the man.</p>
<p>"Don't act old. You look like you're eighteen." The man put his hand on the woman's leg for a long time.</p>
<p>While chatting and smoking, he offered the third sister a few puffs. Only when the last bit of cigarette was burned did he put down the pipe and caress the third sister for a while. He took out a dollar and placed it on the ashtray. The woman said,</p>
<p>"Don't leave money."</p>
<p>"You want me to leave that instead?" The man smiled, straightened his melon-cap hat, and walked out the door.</p>
<p>The woman immediately turned on the lamp on the table, grabbed it, and followed the man out the door, lighting his way outside. She put the lamp inside the doorway to shield it from the wind, and stuck her head out to say, "It's dark, muddy, and very slippery."</p>

<h3 id="e311">An Overview of the Freely Developing French Film Industry <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>Because very few French films are imported into our country, the Chinese people do not have a correct understanding of French cinema. Therefore, here I would like to give a brief introduction to the general situation of the French film industry, which I believe will be welcomed by the readers!</p>
<p>First, we should know that France is a country with a very long history and a very developed sense of individual freedom. Because of its long history, many archetypes and schools have emerged in its film works; and because of the desire to express individual freedom, filmmakers also follow their individual personalities to produce all kinds of films. From this, we can know that the content of French films is diverse and cannot be generally classified as being one thing or another. For example, there may be two films that share the same fundamental concepts and emotions of French filmmaking, but everything else holds different forms and content. From this, it can be imagined that we absolutely cannot infer the entire French film industry from one or two films.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in France, individuals sing their own songs of freedom, and this phenomenon can also be seen in film companies. In France, we see a state of disunity among small companies. These small companies each determine a certain goal before they start making films, rather than producing them non-stop throughout the year. Therefore, there are companies that only produce one or two films a year, and there are also companies that are founded solely for the production of one film. This proliferation of small companies, on the one hand, contributes to the production of films with new flavors that are outside the scope of large companies, but on the other hand, it also has the disadvantage of shoddy production. In short, in the French film industry, all kinds of filmmakers are acting under their own consciousness and intentions, providing the audience with films of different qualities.</p>
<p>Currently, the largest film company in France is (Patia Natan). This company has many excellent directors and stars, and has franchised cinemas throughout France. We can say that the company holds the reins of the French film industry.</p>
<p>In the last year or two, French films have rarely had original stories, and most are film adaptations of novels and plays. This tendency, on the one hand, is due to the entry of people from the theater world (such as theater actors and playwrights) into the film industry, and on the other hand, it is also because it is a relatively safe method to bring works that are already known to the world to the screen.</p>
<p>These kinds of films can be broadly divided into the following two types: the first is the film adaptation of ancient famous works, which can be said to be a work of art; the second is light comedies that are only meant to entertain people. In the latter, the extensive use of song and dance is a given, and France is especially rich in this kind of light-hearted, humorous work.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e312">The Bowery <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>The unkempt appearance, the weathered cabaret singer, the rough and barbaric hooligan, the drawn-out screams, the pervasive smoke, the chaotic jumping of a group of low-class people. This is what "The Bowery" depicts.</p>
<p>The United States' dispatch of troops to Cuba is a vigorous demonstration of the Monroe Doctrine. Thus, "The Bowery" uses this topic to promote the power of the sovereign state in today's turbulent Pacific situation.</p>
<p>Here, "The Bowery" clearly has a different meaning from the Soviet Union's "Road to Life," although they both depict hooligans and wanderers. The latter points out that wandering children should organize themselves and sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the broad masses of people and the construction of society, while "The Bowery" wants proletarian hooligans to participate in a crazy imperialist war. Building for the benefit of the broad masses of people is historical progress, while imperialist war should be opposed.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, director Paul Walsh has achieved great success. Not only are the static and dynamic rhythms of the entire play coordinated with each other, but the handling of the pictures is obviously very careful, intelligent, and vivid. If "The Bowery" can achieve very commendable results, indelible credit should be given to this director, which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Kike's cheerful entrance into the crowd at the tavern, taking off his hat and cheering, powerfully contrasts the indifference and insults he receives later when he loses power.</p>
<p>The depiction of Kike's rudeness is carved out in small details, such as his stunning the singer and the musician, and his attacking gesture when he smells a small explosion while lighting a cigar.</p>
<p>The scene where a man goes to put out a fire and a woman steals the money from his pants pocket very delicately exposes the ugliness of the so-called lower class.</p>
<p>When Kike meets Lucy and takes her home, the child Squire dislikes Lucy and is beaten by Kike. Squire angrily takes his toys and leaves Kike's home with his second wife. The depiction of that wild child is so cute, although Jack Cooper's performance is half the reason. And the singer's dancing after getting drunk in the carriage and singing at the window simply beautifies the noisy Bowery like a hundred poems.</p>
<p>After Kike loses power, Kike's photo is taken down and replaced with Steve's photo; Kike sadly descends the steps, suffering the insults of the crowd; Kike lowers his head sadly and silently fiddles with his watch chain; and when Kike leaves home, placing his suitcase on the table and giving money to Lucy: Lucy declines, but Kike insists: Kike picks up the suitcase and slowly walks towards the door; Kike opens the door and painfully raises his head to look at everything in the house, until Lucy covers her face and cries, are the most astute places in the film.</p>
<p>In terms of dubbing, the connection with the pictures is very lively and appropriate. Such as the delicate music when Kike sees Squire sleeping in bed and when Kike and the woman kiss, such as the wildly blaring whistle when Steve falls into the water and does not get up...</p>
<p>A few lines in the dialogue should also be mentioned, such as Lucy saying to Steve: "You are now violating the law." And Steve replies: "The law may be wrong." Among the actors, Warner Oland is the best, Jack Cooper's meal, George Raft, Fay Wray, and the mute artist all worked very hard.</p>
<h3 id="e313">Review of "Dancing Lady" <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Dancing Lady Grand Theater</p>
<p>Perhaps I am a very insensitive person, and after watching some movies, I often feel that there is nothing to say. This is naturally because after watching it, I have no impression of myself.</p>
<p>"Dancing Lady" is also the same film that will not arouse any strong interest in me. However, I don't think it's entirely because of my insensitivity, but because the film itself has no value.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, American films often have frivolous and superficial things, which is difficult for people who deeply feel the weight of life in the current society to have the leisure to accept this slight smile. Precisely because of this, if filmmakers closely grasp realistic themes and prick our lives, arousing our inner emotions, then we will inevitably be moved by it. Of course, this is not to ask American filmmakers to give us spiritual satisfaction, because that would be ridiculous; it is just our opinion on that kind of light and superficial work.</p>
<p>"Dancing Lady" is undoubtedly a frivolous work, and this is shown throughout the entire film, revealing that kind of insignificant sentiment. Like every mediocre work, it only depicts a so-called love picture of male and female entanglements. Perhaps the screenwriter wanted to add some embellishments of art for art's sake in addition to this point, like adding a few shreds of meat to a bowl of plain noodles. Originally, art for art's sake is not a fashionable thing, let alone so slight and weak here.</p>
<p>In short, the story here is meaningless, nothing more than commonplace and vulgar interweaving. If the lady entangled with that wealthy provincial man for her own future, showing a little of the magic of money, then how is this not extremely commonplace.</p>
<p>As for the song and dance scenes, they are not so amazing, and do not fully show the superficial prosperity of capitalism like "Gold Diggers of 1933". Perhaps the director also used some clever techniques in the play, such as when Joan Crawford follows Clark Gable, using the fastest tempo, which is quite interesting. And the various things in the gym are also vivid. However, it is in these places that the light style is achieved. As for the acting skills of the male and female leads, there are no special strengths.</p>
<p>Finally, perhaps some people will say that the level of criticism is too high, but for American films with such advanced film technology, why should we lower the level?</p>
<h3 id="e314">Mei Lanfang to Make a Movie? <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— Qingxia</p>
<p>The Tianyi Film Company previously hired Peking Opera veteran Tan Fuying and Qingyi Xue Yanqin to film "Si Lang Visits His Mother," which was very profitable, but there were no successors. This time, Mei Lanfang came to Shanghai and, at the invitation of Huang Jinrong, a celebrity in Shanghai, performed at the Huangjin Grand Theater. However, it was not long before the term expired. Now, I heard that a certain film merchant in this port saw that Mei Lanfang's art was famous all over the world. If he could make a film, it would not only be a refreshing experience for the Chinese people, but also allow foreigners to see it first; coinciding with the time when movies are so popular, it also implies the purpose of promoting our country's inherent art. Therefore, he will personally discuss with Mei Lanfang, Tan Fuying, and others, but whether it can be realized is still unpredictable. Let's record it to see what happens later.</p>
<h3 id="e315">Wang Renmei's Kitten <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Qingxia</p>
<p>When Wild Rose Wang Renmei saw Li Lili raising a white puppy, she also went to raise a kitten. This kitten is very lively, and always cries "Meow" when it sees Wang Renmei. When Wang Renmei sees it, she also always calls "Meow." Sometimes she would hold it in her arms and say to it: "Meow! Don't make noise! I'll sing 'Peach Blossom Red' for you." Then, she actually started singing. It is said that it eats thirty cents worth of beef every day.</p>
<h3 id="e316">Epic Film "Such Is Life" <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>Opening at the Guanglu Lanxin Theater</p>
<p>The latest production of Majestic Lion Films, "Such Is Life," is satirical, profound, tense, and humorous. It depicts the dreamlike nature of life and the illusion of wealth and poverty in a reasonable and well-reasoned manner. It is a masterpiece that awakens the world. The whole story tells the story of a couple and their beloved daughter who run a tea shop in England. The daughter falls in love with a young painter, but is troubled by her poor fate and cannot achieve her ambitions. Later, they receive a huge inheritance from their uncle, and they suddenly become rich, setting up a house and preparing a car, becoming a wealthy family. They hold a grand banquet for guests, singing a song that resounds through the clouds. The joy is overwhelming, and they cannot contain their happiness. The next day, unexpectedly bad news comes: the inheritance is completely divided by the bank. Yesterday's wealth is today's poverty. Fortunately, the painter becomes famous in one fell swoop, and his reputation is ten times greater. He still loves the girl, and when the two meet again, their old love reignites. The painter provides financial assistance to buy back the tea shop and revitalize their business. The old couple smile happily when they see their old home, recalling the past as if it were a dream.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3 id="e317">Queen Christina (10) (3) <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Ju</p>
<p>Antonio stared at her and said, "Why didn't you tell me who you were in the first place?" Christina felt that his voice had softened a lot, so she was very happy and said, "I often thank God for giving me that opportunity to travel incognito. To be able to meet you among the millions of people in the world. To you, I am not a queen, but just an ordinary woman. At that time, I was not a puppet sitting on a golden throne. But now that you have seen me in this disguise, all the beauty and joy are not cancelled out? Then why did you want to tell me my status, to hasten the rapid destruction of all beauty and joy?" Antonio sighed and said, "For you, I have committed the crime of deceiving the monarch." Christina asked, "The crime of deceiving the monarch?" Antonio said, "If someone sent a friend to woo a woman..." Christina interjected, "Joke, what love is there in your mission; it's just a clever chess piece on the European chessboard. But what we said in that snowy little inn was..."</p>
<p>Antonio resolutely said, "We don't need to mention everything before. Let's pretend it didn't happen." All the joy on Christina's face disappeared. She said faintly, "Alright. Then carry out your mission and try to get me to agree to your request." Antonio glared at her and said hatefully, "If I said a word that would be punished by death, I would still have to say it. You are really a royal whore. How you must laugh at my foolishness and naivety. Well, let me tell you, since I left you, I have been dreaming of you day and night, restless! Good, your victory is complete. What else do you want?" After he finished speaking, he turned around. Christina walked closer to him, raised her head and said to him, "Just this." Antonio said, "Please send me away." Christina's voice was full of enthusiasm and said, "Our love is sincere, and I believe it even more now. Why do you still go against your wishes and push me away? Can our words be changed? Can our love be changed?..."</p>
<p>Antonio could no longer restrain his heart. He suddenly knelt down and shouted, "Christina, my dearest." She stroked his hair. Outside, the orchestra played soft Spanish music, which was the tune played by Antonio's attendants in the inn that snowy night. Christina asked Antonio, "Antonio, do you remember?" Antonio suddenly stood up and hugged Christina, and their love was united again. But love in the royal family is not like love among ordinary people, and it is often destroyed by great forces. The biggest destructive force here is Finance Minister Magnus. He used Prince Charles and the power of the people, because the people, at the suggestion of Prime Minister Oxenstierna, had long formed a mind against the king marrying a foreigner, and especially opposed the Spanish king, because he was a Catholic monarch, while Sweden was a Protestant country. As things became more and more dangerous, Prime Minister Oxenstierna knew about Magnus and Charles' dangerous plot, but he could no longer stop it. (To be continued)</p>
