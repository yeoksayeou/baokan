<p>時評</p>
<h3>中日交好之關鍵恒</h3>
<p>日前倫敦電。英國一黨領袖藍施堡。發表意見。謂彼若處於中國之地位。極願與日本和好。同時亦勸告日本放棄其武力侵略中國之政策。以互助友好之態度。謀達兩國共存共榮之目的。藍氏此種意見。與數日前蔣委員長對日本記者之談話。正相脗合。蔣委員長之言曰。「中日兩國。唯有以道德信義爲基礎。始能解决一切問題。至其關鍵。則在於日本而不在中國。」我人細玩二氏之言。實足互相發明。藍氏側重雙方之互相讓步。蔣氏則側重日本之先行悔悟。而其期望國際和平之心理。則不相軒輊也。</p>
<p>我人盼望中日交好之殷。亦與世之愛好和平者同。唯我人以爲今後中日之交好。正如蔣委員長所謂「關鍵純在於。」蓋今日日强我弱。舉世咸知。然我縱以萬分誠意。與彼交好。而彼仍不放棄其旣定之政策。則亦奚益耶。且國與國之關係。不殊於個人。設有某甲侵奪某乙之所有。因而互相交惡。則欲其各好如初。自以某甲歸還侵物。爲最善之法。設不此之圖。而徒强乙對甲表示好感。無論乙之表示出於萬分勉强。决不足以言中心悅服。卽云乙能健忘舊𨻶。亦安能取信於甲。蓋在甲之意。必以爲此乃乙之「假具面。」將待時而動也。故國際間眞欲確立誠信。捨强者放棄其侵略行爲。别無他道。今後欲以和平手腕而謀中日關係之改善。必由日方開其。職是故耳。</p>
<p>我所以謂日人必不能以誠意與中國交好。而每疑中國爲假面具者。非無故也。試舉日報之言以爲證。</p>
<p>十一月一日日本大阪每日新聞載有汪兆銘之外交不過假裝一文。其言曰。汪院長所倡對日一面抵抗一面交涉之口號。爲求中國苟安之假面具。及敷衍日本之機會主義。若日本遭逢國際危險。即將改變其對日政策。况有歐美派時欲利用歐美勢力打倒日本。故日本應即示以正義與威力。以促中國反省云云。</p>
<p>此卽我前說日本無誠意之一證也。夫世界各國外交之目的。必以策本國安全。並維持世界和平爲本位。外交政策之運用。因時制宜。本非一成不變。無所用其假面具。亦無所謂機會主義。我國當局之外交目的。卽在乎是。故世界各國。凡能以公道信義待我者。無不與之誠意交好。亦無所謂親歐美或親日本也。今該報爲是言。適見其意存挑撥而已。日本如眞有謀中日親善。重建兩國友好關係之意。應先大澈大悟。表示尊重中國之主權。則此種僵勢。自然易於打開。若徒妄事揣測。巧弄手段。必致中日關係。日趨惡化而無接近之機此中關鍵。誠如蔣委員長之言。在日本而不在我也。</p>

<h3>海軍談判僵局聲中美英日樽俎折衝</h3>

<p>東京閣議决單獨毁海約</p>
<p>（倫敦）英美日三國海軍談話中之今後動作、將爲美代表史丹德萊、與日代表山本之會晤、衆信山本將乘此機會向美代表說明質的限制之技術方案、按山本已於十一月三十日將此方案告知英海軍參謀長查斐爾爵士、今日美代表團將請英日代表午餐、英相麥唐納·外相西門·海相孟塞爾、海軍參謀長外部克萊基·日大使松平日代表山本與岩下、皆在被請之列、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國代表團固執其現行比率、頗持强硬態度、迭次揚言結束此項豫備會商、但至今已達第七週、而關於技術上細節、仍由英美日三國代表間表示其多角之進展、現在討論之基調、仍係英國政府之妥協試案、特别關於各國保有之兵力宣言自主及其質的限制之内容、續行專門討論、英國政府除自主宣言案以外、對於設立各國保有量之最大限度並不反對、代表之意見對於此點、似已一致、至保有量最大限度之數字、英美兩國主張總數爲百萬噸内外、與希望澈底縮少之日本軍縮基準方式相隔尙遠、倘與英美兩國拮抗、以圖實現均　、則日本政府結果當以相當限度之軍備擴張爲必要、此種情形、日本斷難首肯、關於其他質的限制等等問題、山本代表已與查斐爾提督會談、其次最感困難者輒爲美國代表卽作戰部長史丹德萊提督、現日方决計不與多人交談、擬取一齊衝鋒之手段、業由山本代表向該提督申請會見、但美國代表團聲明、如係名義上之均等尙可討論、如係實際上之均等則絶對反對、並須於冬至節前撤回本國、據上項情形觀之、美日兩國代表之接近、仍屬至難之事、倘日本政府廢除華府海約、則彼等斷然撤退、現已表示此種氣魄、曾由西門外相迭次設法斡旋、而與台維斯氏之會見仍無任何結果、結局太平洋防備限制條項之單獨保留案似亦經撤銷了事故豫備會商現在不至遽行結束、仍由三專家代表以數字上之交涉爲中心、暫時繼續會商云、（二日日聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）本日午後零時半、政府在院内開緊急閣議、决定華府條約採通告廢棄之手續、卽諮詢樞府、旋卽以書面上奏、蓋意大利駐日大使雖未訪問外務省、然意大利政府拒絶勸誘共同廢棄之眞意已明、故採單獨廢棄之手續、（三日電通電</p>
<p>（東京）海軍當局關於華府條約之决定廢棄意嚮如下、</p>
<p>華府條約之廢棄、與帝國政府確立之公正妥當軍縮方針、乃當然之歸結、故一經閣議决定、不久卽將通告關係國、至廢棄之目的、僅係成立得樹立世界和平眞正軍縮協定之手續、故雖在通告廢棄後、對於軍縮問題仍將與關係國繼續與現今相同之友好折衝、（三日電通電）</p>
<h3>華府約廢止後日本籌善後策</h3>
<p>擬繼續與英美折衝</p>

<p>（巴黎）時報發表社論評論日本政策、略謂德國目下在歐洲各國首都頗有外交活動、歐洲人士大爲注意、但吾人不能因德國之活動、而忽視遠東正在發展之局勢、蓋日本之目的、乃欲推翻歐洲各國在遠東之傳統勢力也、現在東京政府所致力者、不僅在於海軍問題、同時並以極堅决之行動、圖謀鞏固其一手造成之「滿洲國」、又在亞洲命運所關之各地帶内所取得之櫌越地位、日本亦思鞏固之、時報繼討論日本外相廣田最近對貴族院所發表之宣言、謂一般人以爲不久將有武裝衝突、此層絶不可信、蓋日本人寗願採用適應時宜之靈敏外交手腕以謀進展、外交方法固較遲緩、但其結果比較可靠、且日本外交業已得到結果、大足鼓勵日本使之繼續進行、例如日俄兩國國交前甚緊張、現則漁業上之意外事件已不復發生、中東路讓渡問題、亦有解决之望、凡此足徵兩國邦交之改善、「日本與蘇俄關係趨於良好之言、曾出諸廣田外相之口、如此情形、較之數月前之緊張形勢實覺有利、但日俄兩國在遠東之政治問題、畢竟尙未解决也、時報旋論及倫敦海軍談話、謂「日本之所求者、實際並非欲根本廢止各種海約、以便自由建造强大之海軍、日本之意不過欲廢止華府海約、另訂新約、規定公司同最高噸數、俾各國各有眞能適應其國防需要之海軍力量耳、現在倫敦談判中、業已發現一種新折衷方案由日本示意者、其大意係主張訂立一種十年協定、在前五年之中、英美日仍各繼續實行其造艦計畫、至第六年以後、英美兩國卽應停止、而日本則繼續造艦、俾其海軍力量逐漸增加、以至與英美相等爲止、（按華府海約所定之五·五·三比率、英美日三國海軍實際並未達到此數、所謂前五年紕續造艦者、卽在使三國海軍力量、實際成五·五·三之比率、至第六年以後、英美兩國卽維持五·五之數、不得再加、而日本則繼續造艦、以期逐漸由五·五·三·增至五·五·五是也、）由此方案、又可窺見日本政策及外交之特點、卽不欲出於决裂、但其所抱之目的則絶不放棄、其進行方法係按照目前所能達到之點、努力以赴之耳云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>西北視察記本報特派記者賡雅</h3>
<p>西北交通要具之旱船</p>
<p>九日晨起、頗覺寒冷、昨掘沙井、滿結厚冰、纒伕去冰、高呼「駝駝駝」之聲、駝在遠處吃草、聞卽昻首來、排立井（實爲長溝）旁、「哺哺」吸飲、飲量極大、故三四日無水、不飲亦能遠行、迄午啟程、山遠地嚝、草叢稀少、惟時見齡灘而已、三十里大泉、止而放駝、并候護兵、泉自崖𨻶湧出、悠然西流、蓄之成池、可灌田畝、居民舊有二十餘家、今亦逃散無人、已開熟地、大小四十餘坵、未開荒野、一望無際、全聽荒棄、殊爲可惜、</p>
<p>次晨卽雙十節、郵差依然騎送郵包、駝伕依然放駝尋柴、幾不知今日乃民國誕生之佳節、記者因候晤護兵、决在此停留一日、雖不啻得享例假一日之悠閒生活、究以未獲見臨風招展之黨國旗、與聆要人紀念令節之名論、殊有欿然不自足之感、偶見駝伕、繩繫駝足、用錐浮穿掌部、縫綴皮地於上、不禁又興對駝研究之趣、爰將前此記駝未尋處、續述于后、駝掌原係軟肉、若爲沙石磨破、卽顚跛難行、故用皮塊、補其傷處、迨其痊愈、補皮卽自脫落、若行粗砂戈壁、爲預防駝掌之磨破、旣不能如騾馬之釘鐵掌、（又名鐵蹄）亦有用皮裹足、如穿鞋然、倘遇不狹不淺之溝、駝難一躍而過、且亦不能深跴溝中、此時駝伕、竟有俯臥於溝、以墊駝步、可保無傷、夜遇關卡、欲偷捐稅、只消歇止鈴聲、稅局卽無所聞、此無他、皆因駝掌柔軟、舉步輕巧故也、然欲其登高跨檻、則又遠遜騾馬之本能、</p>
<p>駝性馴力大而胆怯、寒帶之高等動物也、宜行沙漠、負重致遠、可四五日不飲食、素有「旱船」「旱龍」之稱、身高約七八尺、首尾長及丈餘、峯分雙單、雙峯駝最多、性較馴服、殊宜駄運、單峯駝較少、性烈善走、宜供騎用、南疆外蒙之荒漠中、時有單峯野駝之發現、惟難馴服、只可捕食、𠟤駝最貴、每頭約五六十元、牡駝牝駝次之、每羣之中、僅留雄駝二三頭、每値冬末交尾期、牝駝口中流涎、俗名曰潮、潮後方與牝駝伏臥而交、謂之「打羔、」及受胎後、牝駝一見牡駝、卽遠避而不伏臥、生產期則在對年之後、甚有孕至十五個月者、平均三年可生二頭、故有「三年兩見面之說、倘遇中途生產、將駝羔加載母駝背上、母駝仍可一併運行、</p>
<p>駝羔生長一年後、牡者割去睪丸、是卽𠟤駝、三四年後、卽可負重、善爲飼畜、壽可三十年、惟須先穿鼻梁、始便牽引、穿鼻所用木棍、長約四寸、粗如小指、一端大如葱頭、或係木叉、他端尖銳、洞穿鼻皮、自右而左、穿孔之處、内部中空、外部僅隔皮肉一層、挺然穿透、且有不至流血者、蓋天然之生成也、駝繮卽繫穿木之尖端、重牽彼卽痛鳴、行時前後相維、卽成魚貫、繮斷委地、彼卽中止、繮端埋於撮土、彼卽不敢移步、牽繮搗地、彼卽跪伏、若二駝首尾互繫其繮、卽自作「螺旋舞」不已、夜臥所需駝陣之方式、亦莫不各依繮繩以就範、記者所騎之　、甚恨犬在旁行、見犬必重踢之、若距犬稍遠、其將踢也、必輕　數步、使犬不及預防而逃、又敦煌誌載、天將大起黑風、老駝預知、恒作長鳴、餘駝卽埋嘴唇於沙中、人見其狀、亦迅籌避風之法、無何、黑風果至、駝爲龐然大物、且具智力如此、不料繫以細繮、竟永爲積威所服、不敢輕輕擺脫、亦可哀矣、</p>
<p>駝鞍以毛綫織成、粗若麻袋、内塞雜草、作長方形、每駝則需兩片、另用二木、使夾於駝峯之左右、貨物卽細載其上、長途可運三百餘片、短程可四五百斤、普通日行七八十里、騎駝則可四五百里、每年駝運時期、約七八個月、四五月間、放之野外、任其食宿、謂之放塲、亦曰打塲、察綏兩省之放塲者、恒遠選草塲於數百里外、使得盡量食息、脫換新毛、至八九月間、驅回使用、謂之起塲、此時膘肥氣壯、無庸飼料、　至歲尾、草枯肉瘦、始用蒸熟之豆餅、洒水揉碎、用袋盛掛駝首、各就貨　、伏臥而食、乘機上　、頗覺便利、駝臥時、先跪前腿、再曲後腿、起則相反、俗稱駝占十二相、卽鼠牙·牛蹄·虎腔·兎嘴·龍頸·蛇眼·馬耳·羊鼻·猴毛·雞脚·狗囊·猪尾·等是、又云「頭似胡羊頸似鵝、也非驢馬也非騾、」細爲觀察、誠屬不謬、駝伕牽駝、各按次序、每人牽駝十數頭、各以繮繩維繫、依次魚貫前行、人牽最先一駝、謂之「頭駝、」進止槪隨已意、最後一駝、頸懸大鈴、叮叮噹噹、謂之「擺鈴、」倘有脫落、後駝中止、鈴亦無聲、人卽察覺、以便返繫、駝畏炎熱、且須放草、故每日行程、多在午後及夜半、每到詀口、先卸貨　、後搭帳房、打柴煮飯、放値夜、察綏者多係指定、甘新者多係輪流、每伕月得工資、察綏約爲六元、甘新祇二元、飲食粗𧞵、工作繁重、待遇苛刻、亟須改善、</p>
<p>我國西北各地、交通多不發達、嚝野荒漠、仍恃駝運、茲據南京報載、全國駱駝之統計、外蒙共有二、六三七頭、寗綏察熱四省、八○、○○○頭、黑龍江五八、○○○頭、新疆五○、○○○頭、靑海五○、○○○頭、陜甘共二○、○○○頭、總計二六○、六三七頭、可舌知駝在西北交通工具上、尙占一重要之地位焉、</p>

<p>現在我們可以把在位的人分做四種人來說、（一）恐怕是守舊的、在有利的地位、站在特殊階段、（二）自由思想者、對於現有制度要想法改良、要想造新的制度、（三）過激派要打倒一切舊的制度、來創造一個新的制度、（四）反動份子因爲要保持他們特殊的利益、所以要打倒過激派、我是生在有錢家裏的人、但是我不守舊、因爲對於現有制度不滿意、後來變爲自由思想者、要想去改良牠我覺得仍舊不够、就變成過激派、想創　新的制度、現在我是一個社會主義者、我主張不流血去建設新的制度、我要舉一個例、我住的地方、與一個中央車站很近、這是一個很大的車站、有五十條軌道、進出的火車很多、每天有一百萬的人來去、許多東西、都靠火車運來的、這個舊車站很狹小、很黑暗、而且很不乾凈、若是要造一個新的車站、恐怕幾千萬的人要感到一切的不便利、而且車站不是一時可以造成的、至少要費一二年的工夫、才可以造成、所以還是暫時維持原狀、在地下築了二十五條的軌道、又在舊車站四周、造了新建築、等到新建築都完成了、就把　的車站拆掉、這樣一來、交通一點兒不停頓、人民一點兒也不感到不便、所以我們要想創造一個新中國、也要用這個方法、現在我們知道這些人對於舊的制度不滿意、或者對於現有政府不滿意、就是我對於美國政府、也有許多不滿意的地方、但是一個國家、一定要有一個政府、所以第一要有政府、政治法律要有秩序、（二）要有良好的政府、（三）自治的政府、要有民治·民　·民享的政府、這種政府、不能立刻就有的、正像改造中央車站一樣、要慢慢地來把舊的車站來做新的基礎、不要像蘇俄這樣、和白俄戰爭的時候、一共死亡一千萬、我也不願意中國還有太平天國的革命、我也不希望中國常常的革命、現在有兩椿事情、我們要去奮鬥、（一）改良現有的制度、（二）創造新的制度、在三十年中間、我來過中國九次、中國現有的希望、比從前更在、雖然有許多地方是不對、使人不滿意、但是中國有一個新的希望、前幾天我坐飛機在空中望下來、看見有光明和黑暗的地方、黑暗的地方、我們要設法改良、中國的人品多、勞力大、有四萬的人、佔全世界的人口四分之一、農民有四千年的歷史、最能吃苦的、並且有一種特長、能銘和本地人競爭、這是　　和菲列濱人所不及的、况且中國人是三大種族之一、在上古西方人没有穿衣服的時候、中國人都穿絲的衣服了、在西方尙無文化的時候、中國人早有指南針·紙·火藥·印刷品·等等的發明了、中國不僅是一個古的民族、實在是一個新的民族、並且是有力量的民族、美洲的紅種人、現在漸漸地消滅下去、但是中國百分之八十的農人、能够吃苦、雖然從前蒙古族和滿族、曾經克服過中國、但是現在他們的勢力在那裏　、因爲中國古時建造了道德基礎、所以蒙古族·滿族·雖然强、也不能滅亡中國的國家咧、我覺得中國人很好的道德基礎、今天我們有很大的希望、我們看到中國各省最近的建築公路、比蘇俄來得有成效、南京有些建築、比　斯科來得好、中國的靑年政治家、都充滿着一種希望、都願意改良農村、他們把建設農村做爲天職、還有一種新生活運動、是蔣委員長所提倡的、這種運動、是建造新道德的運動、但是現在還没有完全成功、這種運動、是提倡不再剥削人民、不再揩油、中國有希望的啟示、中國應該建造新的社會秩序起來、雖然中國有希望、但是也有危險的地方、現在中國受國際的侵略、東四省已經喪亡了現在的華北正是烏烟瘴氣的、漫着、日本將麻醉的藥品、如海洛因、嗎啡、等等、流　華北、如同天上的黑雲一樣、現在中國要兩條路裏選走一條、或者像波蘭的陷入滅亡、或像丹麥的自救、從前波蘭、東有强暴的仇敵、把東方四省搶去、而其餘的地方、也是發生重大的危險、他們的農人無知無識、領袖也是大家意見分歧、互相爭戰、大家都抱有揩油的主義、所以一百五十年的功夫、在地圖上没有波蘭的名字、若是中國仍舊繼續抱這種揩油主義、恐怕一百五十年的功夫、在地圖上也没有中國的名字了、我們看到高麗的滅亡、也是爲了揩油的緣故、省長揩油、政府揩油、皇帝剥削人民、所以高麗要滅亡、現在高麗的街名、者換了日本的名字、日本文字在高麗敎授着、所以在中國揩油的習慣、一定要停止、我們希望農民也要受相當的敎育、正如丹麥一樣、丹麥在一個時候、被德國佔　了、南部的肥省、牠的農民、没有知識、不受敎育、領袖意見分歧、各自爲政、也是揩油、幸　後來有兩個人出來、把丹麥挽救轉來一個是主敎、一個是庸德先生、他們所做的事情、（一）喚醒人民的愛國心、（二）復興敎育、（三）建設農村分配土地、使百分之五十的農民、有地可種、借欵給農民、並創設合作社、比德國、俄國、美國、還要好、（四）以宗敎增進國民的道德、用了上面的四種方法、去改變丹麥的不良制度、别個國家、如英國·加拿大·都已實行、中國也能實行、并且中國也能收復東北四省的失地哩、我們效法波蘭、還是效法丹麥、要改進中國、團結中國、正想丹麥一樣、爲了這個緣故、所以我又回到中國來、（未完）</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<p>小西天</p>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　誯笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅迫敷粉學風流</p>
<p>同坑的月英笑道：舅娘急糊塗了，你不是把衣服打了個捲，當枕頭枕着嗎？胡嫂子喲了一聲搶着穿好了衣服，一面扣紐絆，一面摸索着來開大門。黑暗中見個人影子突立在門品，雖然明知道是小紀，心裏頭倒有些碰碰亂跳，倒向後縮了兩步。小紀道：是胡嫂子吗？胡嫂子道：有什麽急事，摸了黑來找我。小紀道：我和那賈老爺說好了，約了明天早上，你帶了人去說話。胡嫂子道：他說了給我一塊錢吗？小紀道：那是我騙你起來的一句話。胡嫂子呸了一聲，兩手就來關上大門。小紀道。你千萬要去，那塊錢已經交給我了。胡嫂子道：眞的嗎？你把錢交給我。小紀頓了一頓，笑道：你不放心我，我也不放心你呢。你明天早上，帶了人去了。我自然交給你。說畢小紀抽身走了。他心裏也就想好了，釣魚的人，少不得要費點香餌，偷鷄的人，少不得要去一把糧，就出一塊錢罷。旣肯出一塊錢，也就不怕胡嫂子不來了。小紀很有把握的回到小西天去，自預備了明天所應辦的一些事情。果然，到了次日早上六點多鐘。胡嫂子，就帶了月英悄悄的走到小紀房間外面，先微微的咳嗽了兩聲。小紀坐在屋子裏抽紙烟，眼望了屋頂，正在想心事，明明聽到，却不理會。胡嫂子只好扶着門，伸進一個頭來，笑道：紀大哥在屋子裏呢，怎麽不理我？小紀笑道：我又不能隔墻看物，你在外邊不呌我，我怎麽知道你來了。他扶着門走了進來，低聲笑道：你不是呌我早上來嗎？我這就來了。小紀道：那姑娘呢？（八零）</p>
<h3>朋友</h3>
<p>— 季誠性</p>
<p>在這世風不古，人心日下的社會中，你想我幾個同甘苦的朋友，不能說不是一個難題目。但是你想交交酒肉朋友的，那眞是多如牛毛了！</p>
<p>現在人不重情義而重勢利的，因爲勢利於他才有好處，才有登龍的機會。這也許大家看慣了老張交了紅運做起大官，於是老張的朋友就可在大樹底下避避風雨了！老李發了一注横財，就有許多朋友追逐老李左右，聽候老李的呼喚了！</p>
<p>一個失意的人，正如一個臭了的烏　，連螞蟻也不會來嗅一嗅的。我不曾聽見落難公子被一個少女歡愛過；也不曾聽見窮漢子被富人靑睞過。但我聽見過因爲斷了經濟的節制而引起了朋友的反目；也聽見過許多人在計較朋友贈他禮物的多寡，他們全不知道Fuller（福洛）所說的：「莫用禮物來獲得朋友，當你停止了餽贈時，他們便會把你遺棄的」。眞的，世界上爲别人减輕重負的人是罕見的，卽使有，也無非像沙漠中的鮮花！</p>
<p>「假使没有朋友，眞孤獨了；友誼之光是和暖的，没有它，人類的末日彷彿快要到了」！我時常這樣想。</p>
<p>「卽使那人犯了盜犯罪的，只要他與他的朋友有珍貴的友誼，他還是和藹可親！」我的一個朋友說。</p>
<p>人類眞的不需要朋友嗎？如果不需要的話，那麽請讀一讀史梯芬生這段名言吧！「我們有一日愛着别人，便該爲那人效勞一日，有一日爲别人所愛着時，我敢說我們，是一日不可缺少的；仍然有一個朋友的人，便不是無用的廢物。」</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （蒼）</p>
<p>▲書是精神的糧食，是對的，那末壤的書便是精神上的毒藥了。</p>
<p>▲思想猶如荒田，不加耕芸，不加培植，决不會開出燦爛的花朶來的。</p>
<h3>張小姐</h3>
<p>— 趙咏梅</p>
<p>也算幸運，我得和蜜斯張做了一年零六個月的鄰居，據鄰家劉媽媽說：張小姐搬到這里來的當兒，還是藍竹布衫和布底鞋，這幾年來，伊的態度可大大變更了！</p>
<p>誠然：蜜斯張現在是漂亮啦，伊有着鬈曲的細髮，大而黑的眼睛，粉也似的嫩面，血也似的櫻唇，再櫬上了高跟鞋和長旗袍，愈覺得異樣標緻，綜之，凡是摩登女郎一切的摩登裝飾品，伊都有。東亞的標準美人不屬於伊，可說是千古奇寃。</p>
<p>電影，好像和伊前世有緣似的；當漁光曲連映六十天的當時，伊也像漁光曲一樣；從不脫一次期，當電影看畢回來，伊盛說男胡星有藝術的天才，至於女明星呢，在伊的口里眞是說得不値一文。假使你凑趣的說一句：普天下女子只有我們蜜斯張是最好的呀！那末，伊嫣然一笑，欣喜得連會泡出頂細頂香的茶芽來給你澗口。</p>
<p>當然啦，張小姐是讀過書的，唱歌和跳舞，是伊的拿手戲，在飯後或夜闌的時候，可以聽到伊唱最流行的歌曲丨丨桃花江是美人窩丨丨在無聊中聽到這淸大年計劃不稍懈怠麗的歌聲，我欣喜着自已的耳福眞不淺。</p>
<p>蜜斯張的談鋒很健，無論蒼蠅之微，宇宙之大，一上了伊的口，便說得頭頭是道，可惜伊不是法律家，要是，我想一定比鄭毓秀紅上幾倍。</p>
<p>蜜斯張化錢是不算一回事，伊常常說：錢，有什麽希奇，絲襪及脂粉費，每月不知要化去多少，雖然，蜜斯張的家，境也很是淸貧的。</p>
<h3>不稍懈怠</h3>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「啊！他是長得多麽軒昻雄偉啊？」</p>
<p>「像這樣雍容華貴的氣槪，才不愧爲一個堂堂大國的君主！</p>
<p>各人見了這福畫像之後，不禁都在暗暗讚嘆。我想要是這幅畫像的作者並不曾因爲他是一個皇帝的緣故，特别替他加工煊染的話，那末乾隆的儀表，眞可說是英俊豪雄，世所罕見見了！但若據着正史上以及私人的傳記裏所載的關於這位明主的言行舉止而推測，我們便不難深信這福畫像所表顯的確乎不曾越出眞實」的範圍。</p>
<p>畫上的乾隆是正在行獵的情景，袴下騎着一匹雪似的白馬，它的神駿雄偉，恰堪和它主人的儀表相匹配。馬的背上，照例有一副馬鞍；這副馬鞍是純粹的蒙古式，上面還有無數的寳石鑲嵌着。那兩個脚蹬是全金的，在畫上兀是閃閃地射出耀人的光來。乾隆就在這一副窮極奢華的鞍蹬上，像一座小山似的兀坐着。再瞧他身上也是畫的全副獵裝，外罩一　杏黃色的緊身長比甲·腰間束着一條很闊的緞帶，也是黃色的，上面還釘着許多的珠子。他的軟盔是更别緻了，盔的本身是一頂尖帽，兩旁却有兩隻耳　垂下來，連繫在頷下，很像現在飛機駕駛員所帶的皮帽的格式。這帽子的質料是黃緞，頂上有一簇很長很美麗的紅纓裝着，沿着這一簇紅纓而下，一直到下面的帽邊。（一九○）</p>
<h3>託兒所</h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>社會公益事業，在中國目前似乎還没得到充分的發展，所以有些至今都尙没有舉辦，有如：託兒所之類，在蘇俄就辦得嚴格地好，可是，在中國，成績尙無特殊貢獻。</p>
<p>最近，一般熱心社會事業的努力份子已有不少人對它致以相當的注意了，報紙上的提倡也很多見之於著述了，尤其使人値得注意的，就是日來新光上演「麥夫人」國語聲片，其中故事的串演，雖然集中在戲劇上面，但那離奇故事的開始以至結束的終點，一塲風波的起因，完全是因爲籌募托兒所基金，發起遊藝會，而使某個夫人的家庭間釀成一個滑稽的喜劇。</p>
<p>提倡舉辦託兒所，尤其是能够利用在電影上面，其所收穫的效果，預期是當可宏大的，願大家給予非常注意，同時，更希望製作者在態度上能够更審愼點。（却酬）</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>康僧會卓錫龍華備考</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>今上海龍華寺前之塔，論者咸謂創建於吳亦烏十年。然相傳如是，亦無確據也。今塔下有龍華舍利記碑，略云：</p>
<p>時聞康僧會道高德重，路過龍華蕩，神龍讓宅，結茅修行。王（孫權）認僧見，勸奉佛法。······王勅建塔十三、龍華其一也。</p>
<p>是雖明言康僧會曾居龍華，此塔則爲紀念會所居處而建；然此語亦不知所本，不能取信於人。</p>
<p>今從佛藏中讀康僧會傳，略謂：</p>
<p>康僧會，其先康居人。世居天竺。其父因商賈移於交阯。會年十餘歲，二親並亡，出家爲僧。時孫權已制江左，佛敎未行，會乃杖錫東游，以赤烏十年達建業，營立茅茨，設像行道。權召謂會曰：「若能致舍利，雷爲造塔」。會潔齋禮請，果獲舍利。權大驚服，卽爲建塔。以始有佛寺，故號建初寺。名其地爲佛陀里。會於建初寺譯出衆經。晋太康元年四月寂。</p>
<p>按傳謂會自交阯（今安南北部）至建業，（今南京）其必由海道東來無疑。則或在今上海附近海口登陸，曾結茅於龍華。傳謂「以赤烏十年達建業，勞立茅茨，設像行道」。初視之，似爲結茅於建業。實則達建業爲一事，營立茅茨，設像行道，又爲一事。傳未明言結茅之處。蓋彼時上海僻遠，未有地名，故未詳言。然今之上海旣在所謂江左範圍以内，則安知其結茅處不在上海！</p>
<p>建初寺，佛陀里等名，後世無考。姑從闕欵。惟會旣從交阯由海道至建業，則謂爲在今上海附近海口登陸，似無不可；當時建塔以爲紀念，亦在情理之中也。</p>
<p>竊謂初所建塔必極簡陋，故未見於前人記載及吟咏。以余見聞所及，以唐末没日休過龍華詩爲最早。詩云；</p>
<p>今市猶存古刹名，草橋霜滑有人行。尙嫌殘月淸光少，不見波心塔影横。</p>
<p>細玩首句之意，此時刹已被燬，（按，刹舉塔非同時建，）故云「猶存古刹名」也。若其「不見波心塔影」之句，似指無月而言，與塔之存廢無涉，然意亦甚含混。</p>
<p>今查舊志言塔之興廢，於宋之前亦多未詳。宋太平興國二年重建以後，始有明確之記載。若今日所見之塔，則屢次重修者矣。惟依康僧會東來之道而推測之，則謂會之足跡曾至一海，塔之創始爲紀念會所居處而建立，亦可備一說也。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、先穩繼跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲四五角左右、坎拿大漲二三四角左右不等、當開盤後、以洋麥之報價、兼之趁前週之餘風、故開價之人心、頗覺挺健、本月份開至五角一分、惟開價雖好、後即逐步不振、以天津現粉狀况不佳、故谬帮步步暢脫、一月份以下開價、初尙平定、旋亦已客户脫手、一部分廠家、亦有套出、故二盤以後、步開步跌、有難以回頭之勢、較初開計落一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、市氣逐見不振、近期因津帮胃呆、遠期又傳廠家定成洋麥一船、價六角八分、是以各月份賣氣稍盛、市氣遂覺軟弱也、結果本月份較跌二分半、一月份跌二分七厘半、二月份跌二分二厘半、三月份跌二分七厘半、四月份跌三分、五月份跌二分半、</p>
<h3>小來較前下落尤鉅</h3>
<p>期麥市面、當開價時、以業中人之心思、大致觀望、趨勢平平、迨後以紛市堅而復疲、故交易雖未甚暢、市氣則已鬆落二三分不等、迨至十午開盤、交易依然淸寂、惟粉市因實銷回出而反跌、且傳洋麥續定一船、故遠期人心、步步見虚、較前週之收價、上落頗巨、計一二月份跌八分、三月份跌一角、現麥市面、尙見站定、開徐州山東白麥三元九角四分、次九角二分、瑤灣麥三元九角、次八角九分、由福新去六千包、早豐去三千包、申次去一千包云、</p>

<p>昨米洋本客均活、而產價高昂、囤户心思甚堅、且本街内地胃口均活、昨市價立漲五分、期貨囤户不出、人以亦爲望好、後由達　抛出一千七百五十包、雅利錦隆兩洋行抛出一千二百五十包、共計成交三千噸、價亦見挺、四月份元粒已大至五元零五分、又長粒五元零二分、十二月份四元九角二分、統由本街收入、現洋米共開五千五百包、前傳天津稻米、昨第一批兩小票已抵申、共計三百四十三包、因貨主索價過昂、未有成交、貨品比安南粳爲佳、但不及常帮機粳也、客秈昨被常錫帮及浙跌爭辦、市面由疲轉俏、共開一萬餘包、以沙市糙米爲主、計有七千包之多</p>
<h3>芝麻洋莊去跌尙可</h3>
<p>丨約在四萬噸以上丨</p>
<p>芝蔴洋莊活動以來、統計自新貨上市至今、約有四萬噸以上之交易、行情自七元七八角起已漲至九元五角、昨市略形回軟、成交一百噸、價爲九元三角、行情見修二角、故市塲中人心不定、幸别帮去略尙轉聯、不致過修、昨計開高郵蔴四十包、明光蔴二百三十包、泰州蔴五十一包、張八嶺蔴一百五十包、穎州黃蔴二百五十包、行情請看市價欄去跌爲本街浙紹、黃豆先因標凖豆突跌一角、致人心不振、而挫七八分、後聞大連復漲、市氣轉定、刻下實銷有通州本街内地廠家等問津、故市勢尙不至過辱、</p>
<h3>粳市本廠白堅昂異常</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金堅定、趨勢尙平、惟實銷仍呆、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白呌十八元五角半、碼頭交貨十八元六角半、轉口貨五元二角、八九號荷赤高貨十四元一角、稍有成交、普通呌十四元轉口貨呌四元八角半、本廠綿白勢仍堅緊、振記振裕久擯不出者已近旬日、昨市始有續兌、計振記振裕一號均開十七元六角、二號十七元四角、三號十七元二角、比前盤（二十四日）步漲一元許、太古糖Ｂ嘜十九元六角、號貨開高莊條靑一百數十簍、十元○八角、箱莊片靑百餘件、新貨十元、陳貨九元七角、</p>
<p>▲昨糖業認股稿甲種會員以五十股爲限之十字、　子字、附此更正、</p>
<h3>南北貨生仁動銷轉俏</h3>
<p>生仁昨據靑島電訊、辦價回漲二角、而免稅間題、可期實行、進出易於合算、銷胃復動、故市價轉漲、上午郯城仁開出二千包、較高者六元五角半、次之六元四角、比前日升角許、及至下午、市勢更緊、開封仁開出七十噸、價爲六元六角半、比（一日）好起六角許、徐州仁稍有開出、價爲五元六角半至八角、比前日升二角、尙有一部份要六元、　成、趨勢穩固、</p>
<h3>絲茶外匯緊張絲銷愈靜</h3>
<p>近數日中外匯轉呈緊張、歐美絲銷益趨疲靜、昨晨海外電轉絲價益小、華絲商手貨不充、擯持不售、昨祇達豐等進白廠經三十包、白乾經五包、價均趨疲、</p>
<h3>五金安的目尼跌價之原因</h3>
<p>丨產價太小與市價懸殊丨</p>
<p>安的目尼、爲兵工廠造幣廠以及鉛字房報館等之必需品、近來銀根緊急、買户無力吸收、所以購辦無多、有貨之同業、因產地與本埠售盤相差太遠、查產地每噸售五百元光景、而申市現佔八百四五十元、相距有三百四五十元之多、因此爭圖脫手、是以昨市標凖因之回落達四五十元之譜、計估八百元、交易祇有二百噸、况洋莊生意不動、前途開價、恐防再小也、</p>
<h3>烟皮鐵又見斷檔</h3>
<p>十八張烟皮鐵近來現貨又見斷檔、行情因環境良好、故又漲起五角、每扎售十元○五角、聞搪磁廠熱水瓶等均在急需等用、是以購者愈多、開價轉好云、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「文學與生活」的異議</h3>
<p>— 吳立平</p>
<p>前二天自由談上有位林煥平先生做了一篇文學與生活，他做這篇文章的動機據說是收到了一位詩人的一封報告預備離開文壇深入現實生活的信，目的在指示實際生活的經騐是造成文學家的主要條件，根據這個結論還發揮了很多意見，運用了好些爛熟的語調，把『生活經騐』與『形象』吹到半天雲裏，但没有一個字道及怎樣的生活經騐纔能　實地攝取形象，卽使說觀察生活是可能　且重要的，但可能還須有可能的條件，這個（假定是一個）條件林先生没有告訴我們，也没有聲明，不能在短文裏所能涉及』。於是我們就很有理由相信林先生以爲文學家一跑到實際生活中便一切問題都解决了，似乎實際生活保管可以造成偉大的文學家。這樣的說法已經够樂觀了，更直率的是一以作爲詩人的人而想去當什麽小夥計或小職員，我是很表同感的』，這當然是說爲了做詩而深入實際行活了，着重是在『作爲詩人的人』六字上面，林先生對這樣去參加實際生活的態度旣表同感，且更期待從此產生偉大的詩歌，其實照林先生的指示和引證，他很可以率性担保今後必有偉大的詩歌的產生。</p>
<p>文章雖然繞了許多彎，而其實不過是說文學家必可而且必須以實際生活造成。</p>
<p>在原則上我完全同意這兩個結論，我所不同意的只是林先生對這兩個結論所加的說明。</p>
<p>第一我不同意『作爲詩人的人』參加現實生活可以加實地攝取甚麽形象，能够把生活的眞實如本質表現出來，因爲『作爲詩人的人』和人究竟有點有同，他們參加現實生活的態度亦有差别，故其生活内容亦異，這時，詩人所攝取表現的如果屬於人的範圍，則其眞實性就很成問題了，如果屬於自已的範圍，那只是他自已的眞實，又何苦要深入現實生活呢？</p>
<p>第二我反對林先生引高爾基爲自已立論的證人，因爲高爾基並不是『作爲詩人的人』或『作爲小說家的人』去參加現實生活的，而只是以人的資格去參加現實生活的，這事實不能揑造，有他自已的生活可以做證。巴爾札克，左拉，辛克萊等人我雖不能同樣證明，但林先生也没有證明他們是『作爲小說家的人』去參加現實生活的。</p>
<p>我以爲倘要表現生活的眞實和本質，先就得以人的態度去生活，只有直接的生活纔能接觸生活的眞實和本質，如以詩人的資格去參加現實生活，對現實生活縱然不是傍觀的游戲態度，至少也是以現實生活爲手段的，然則能不能够表現生活的眞實和本質呢？舉兩個最淺顯的例，陶淵明歸田爲農，　該是參加現實生活了，然而他只能作，　　見南山』的詩，假如『悠然』不是現實生活的眞實和本質，那爲什麽呢？我想一定由於他是『作爲詩人的人』去參加現實生活的。近一點的有詩人陳夢家爲找詩料參加過滬戰的現實生活，後來聽說出了一本專寫滬戰的詩，但可惜並不怎樣偉大。</p>
<p>所以『作爲詩人的人』去參加現實生活並不能如林先生之願以償。</p>
<p>和林先生一樣樂觀的中國還大有人在，這現象是出於事實的要求，中國文學的貧乏是事實，企圖轉機是事實的要求，要求的回答是文學家一致開往現實生活中去，去了以後怎樣，回答是林先生的一切都不成問題。但事實將使林先生失望，不信，將來請問詩人要偉大的詩歌便知分曉。</p>
<p>文學家决不是造成的，他不過是實際生活的人，作品也只是直接生活的經騐，他生活並不是爲要產生偉大的作品。中國若有偉大的文學出現，也一定不是甚麽『作爲詩人和小說家的人』之流的作品，然而現在没有產生這種文學的條件，但也不必因此亡想造成文學家來點綴寂寞的文壇。</p>
<p>文學家不日造成的就等於造不成文學家。</p>
<h3>夜市</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>夜市在東京是比白天還熱鬧的。如果要買便宜用品和書籍之類，你可去跑夜市。在平時要三四毛錢買到的東西，一到夜市就只花一毛就行。因爲整個經濟破產，人們購買力薄弱的緣故，所以即使東西便宜到幾分錢的程度，堆積着的貨物，每晚還是這麽多。但，逛夜市的人如山如海，老是擁擠得水洩不通的。自然，在這些人叢中有十分之七八是來看看熱鬧，或者無聊時跑出來散散心的。</p>
<p>因了東北大鬧饑荒的　故，站在街頭募捐的男女學生一天多似一天·他們背着斜的白帶，上面寫着：一東北義能金募集隊」有些也寫着動人的口號，譬如「救濟東北將死的同胞！」「救濟東北饑寒交迫的同胞」有些用播音筒向走路的人大聲喊着：「東北的同胞們連草根樹皮都吃光了，大家捐點錢來救濟吧！」但是走路的人只顧昂頭走過去，任憑拿着捐盒的人怎樣向他鞠躬求援，他連眼睛都不膘一下地走過了。</p>
<p>無綫電，放送着悠揚的，醉人的跳無音樂，這時不知有多少男男女女在影戲院，跳無塲過着蜜甜甜的生活。新宿夜市也比三年前不同了，丢開熱鬧的不說，使人一見驚異的，便是三越的水門汀下坐着蓬頭垢面，骨瘦如柴的男女乞丐。他們穿着破爛的單衣在凄厲的朔風中顫慄：身前擺着一張紙，上面寫着自已如何被難，如何窮苦的話。可是走路的人，目光只向電燈輝煌的地方投射，耳朶裏只聽到醉人的音樂。摩登士女們，還恨死了這些斷路的老「馬鹿」。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>夜市，是適合一般小市民和窮學生們的。有錢的人，他要去大公司買，自然用不着到夜市來貪便宜。因此夜市無形中象微了某一部份人類的社會。</p>
<p>我常和朋友們談及日本人的確太厲害了，無論製造一件什麽東西，小巧玪瓏，輕　美麗，有一種吸引你非買不可的魔力。比方一個裝圖釘或者鋼筆尖，胭脂水粉的小盒子，只要三分錢或者五分錢便可買到，於是喜歡小玩意的小姐們，她不惜把所有皮包裏的錢都掏出來送到夜市。就是因了貨物太便宜，所以每個人的消費特别多，正如日金跌價來日留學的一天多似一天，客歐上似乎是我們趁這時候來求學佔了日本的便宜，殊不知他們正在鬧經濟恐慌的時候，中國留學生一大批一大批的來送錢給他們，難怪他要拼命地說着：「阿利阿多，哥遭衣媽死」了。（這一句是隨便譯音的）</p>
<p>不是理智特别堅强的人，恐怕誰也受不了物質的引誘，走到夜市，即使是個愛錢如命的人，也會送掉至少幾角錢給日本人。惟一的能支配自已情感，不去買那些美麗而又便宜底東西的不是理智，而是金錢。</p>
<p>神田的夜市，大部份都是買書，而新宿和各地的夜市却是賣各種日用品，穿的吃的。</p>
<p>血紅的燈光，盪人心魂的音樂，嘈雜的呌賣聲，悲慘的呼救聲······奏成了東京夜市的交響曲。</p>
<h3>臉譜</h3>
<p>— 賈植芳</p>
<p>聰明人往往是把自已打扮起來，像紳士，或淑女丨總之：除過一身照例的闊衣裳之外：他們的特徵，是一雙會微蹙的眉，和表示輕視記號的輕鼻音丨來敎誨他們眼裏的「愚亡者」，或「下流人」的。</p>
<p>他們一出，一手指天，一手指地，曰：「天地之間惟我獨尊。别人，彷彿眞就像一些廟宇裏塑的泥像，望着袒胸露肚紈袴氣十足的如來，是理應做「站神」，或簡直就該睡在他們的大脚趾下。</p>
<p>他們如果是大學文學系的「正牌文學家」，於是對一個没這個能力去受像他們一樣敎育的機會的，而同時也居然弄弄文學，寫點東西的人說了：</p>
<p>「讀過Dantw底嗎？讀過一本較好些的文學大綱之類嗎？」</p>
<p>這話是帶了濃厚的憐憫口氣說的；他方面，也足襯得出自已的才豐八斗，學富五車。假如被敎誨者，眞太那個的話，那麽，眞像是太傷了他們的心似的，他們立刻能暫抛開了自已的身份，紅紀眼睛，豎直𩓐子，宣言要口誅筆伐了，哇啦哇啦了。於是，「愚亡」，「淺薄」，甚至「甘心下流」，「受人利用」等等詞句，足以堆砌成一個墳墓，使你出氣不得，總纔算合了他們的心。</p>
<p>然而他們自已是死也不肯寫出來一篇，比試比試，這或許就如廚川白村所云，是存心講究一下一缺陷美」？但就歷來事實上證明，原來他們乃「金枝玉葉」，大槪不須動彈一下，而已早是「名流」或什麽家之類了。</p>
<p>所以他們，用不着我們去「强行無禮」的去剥掉闊衣裳，拉破粉面皮，他們自已倒是最忠實於自已藝術的藝術師。曰：他們的臉譜自已早已畫得微妙畢肖的。他們雖没有作品，據說也是修養頗深的，他們閉着眼睛說别人的「愚妄」，「淺薄」，是素不後人的人。</p>
<p>不過假貨總没要有一天現出原形，不用我們費勁去剥掉掛子，戳破面皮；人們也會看出那副畫好了嘴臉是僞製的。</p>
<h3>靑島的音籟</h3>
<p>— 煥明</p>
<p>每天躱在屋裏。屋子是朝南的。從中午到中午，早晚不停的有海風呼呼地吹來。</p>
<p>白天忙忙碌碌的弄點這，動點那；往往什麽正眞事都幹不了。過了夜晚八點，整個的靑島便籠罩在殘秋般的氣氛中了。</p>
<p>「糖包荳包兒······」</p>
<p>這拖長的聲音打窗下簫條地響過去，這種情調和南邊弄堂裏夜深沉時候的賣白糖　心粥差不多。賣荳包兒的穿的凖是黑夜裳，胳膊上提了隻大籃，另一隻手還鈎了盞油燈。在門口住下脚，喊了兩聲，逡巡幾步，才沙丨沙丨的迂慢地捱遠了。</p>
<p>到這時候，海上大槪總有霧。推開窗朝海的那邊瞧；小靑島上的紅燈，在朦朧地一明一滅着。挺美，但也挺寂寞的。一有霧。海口子那邊也「唔唔丨」地發出警告來往船隻的呻吟聲來。那聲浪中夾雜着澎湃　石的海潮呼嘯，有時還能聽到海風飄送過來的喊「車丨」的聲音。這時，對街房子裏的「羅漢氣功治病處」逐漸的熱鬧起來了。拍丨拍地皮鞭子抽得怪響······</p>
<p>我也曾偷偷前去「觀光」過，是這樣的：被治病的人裸了上身運着氣。讓皮鞭子在他身上跳躍。據說這樣也能治病。並且這種治法在靑島的一部份人羣中是很信仰與流行的。我也有病，却未敢這樣的治他一治。</p>
<p>在上海住弄堂房子。早晨第一種音籟是「倒馬桶」，那蛤蜊擦馬桶沙沙沙的聲浪，在北邊絶對聽不到；代替南方淸晨沙沙沙的就是泡水店裏的里里里的開水哨子響的聲音。這泡水店就等於南方的「老虎灶。」但也有不同處：他們不用鐵鍋子煮水而是鉛皮打的一個大水筒煮的，下面還裝有自來水龍頭；賣開水是雜貨舖子的附屬生意。雜貨舖裏有菜疏，水菒，和一切家常日用雜貨覿。非但賣「味　素」，（日文）並且有時還能買到味精！在南邊多年了，未曾見南貨店裏有「味　素」，這該是「南北之有殊」吧？······我起初很慶幸自來水倒底還不是外國貨，現在才知道自已家裏所用的自來水就是日本人資本開辦的火柴公司的出口。父親說：</p>
<p>「銷路最好·······」</p>
<p>一個人孤寂得無聊，常撲在窗口子上朝馬路上發鼓，或是呆聽馬路上轆轆的驢東轔轔的大車聲。拉大車的該是「中國最黑的人」，穿着黑衣褲，敞開大襟，透露出了醬黑的胸脯，臉上汚潢了煤炭灰屑，他們側着五六十度的角在傾斜的街道上　三步退二步的前進着。穿的鞋也是黑的丨黑「勞工鞋」。當然也是日本貨。</p>
<p>在街上，節奏的，木屐的音籟是倒處可聽到的。日本主婦，背上背着個「大包袱」（這話非外行）　彎着身子跑到「大菜市」去採辦東西。店夥堆着笑臉，嫍嫍招呼着，那　話和「日本鬼子」相較；眞是毫無愧色······</p>
<p>最起碼的，最蠢的店夥，也懂得幾句日本話，招呼他們的主顧。</p>
<p>海濱</p>
<p>美國旗艦靜靜的浮在錨上。拍拍拍地，小汽船運了白色的水手在「棧橋」傍了岸。</p>
<p>「Richa······」</p>
<p>他們吵吵嚷嚷的一羣人跳上車，指指前面：「U·S·Bar」</p>
<p>「AY」飛也似的朝中山路狂奔起來。</p>
<p>南方人的悲哀，及中國人的悲哀：</p>
<p>「你先生的貴鄕是···」</p>
<p>「俺是山東丨你老哥是，唔，河北？還是···」</p>
<p>「我是浙江···」</p>
<p>「哦，」臉子像是有點兒變了色：「浙江浙江怕是南方吧？那末先生是「「南方人」？」</p>
<p>「南方人」和「北邊人」在這裏是分得最淸楚的。分得這樣的淸楚比北方人和日本人分得一樣的淸楚。</p>
<p>靑島的音籟，是富有大連的情調的！</p>
<p>但也有不同處；因爲大連比靑島還要凉快些！不，還有一點不相同，就地理上說：大連比靑島還靠北。</p>
<h3>明天（七）</h3>
<p>— （JoscphConrad著）吳向隅譯</p>
<p>「他一定認爲已經替你「預爲之計」到了某程度了。對於女兒們那是最好的方法。那就是丈夫······」他擠擠眼。貝珊小姐專心於她的毛織工作，微微面紅。</p>
<p>「貝珊！我的帽子！老嘉維爾突然狂喊起來。他本來是坐在樹下不講一句話。，他不動一動的，像一個奇怪荒誕，迷信中一個偶像一樣。他從來不開口的，但找他，對她講到她，總是粗暴地喊；到了那時，他從不和緩他難堪的言亂。她的應付辦法給化一個完全不響；他要繼續狂喊，等到他已來伺候他丨丨那就是等到她來搖搖他的臂膊，或在把他的烟斗的嘴子放在他的牙齒當中。他是很少幾個瞎子當中吸烟的一個。當他覺得帽子已放在他的頭上的時候，他立即停止了響聲。於是他站起來，他們兩人一同走過大門。</p>
<p>他沉重地依附她的手臂上。在他們遲慢的吃力的步伐當中，她看起來似乎在拖曳着一個意老不堅定的大塊頭去懺悔一樣。通常他們立即走過馬路（兩座小屋建立在近海口的田野中，離開街的盡頭有二百碼），經過了很久很久的時間，他們依舊在人目前，摸索地走上那到海堤上面的木頭踏步。海堤從東向西蜿蜒着，阻攔着大英海峽的水，像一條廢棄的鐵路路基，在那上面，從來没有火車走過，一羣一羣的粗壯的漁夫從天際出現，沿着海岸走了一會，又遲緩地消失了。他們的棕色的綱，像巨大蜘蛛的綱，放在斜坡上的不整齊的草地上晒着；鎭上的人，從街尾看上來，可以從他們慢慢的小步認出這是嘉維爾父女海格波特船長，無目的地　　　他的兩問小房的周圍，也要抬起頭來看他們的散步已到了什麽地方。</p>
<p>他仍舊在星期日的報紙上照登廣告招尋哈利，海格波特，他先訴貝珊，世界上各地方都可讀到這些報紙。同時他似乎以爲他的兒子仍在英國丨丨非常與柯爾柏魯克相近，他一定可以在「明天」發現他，貝珊並不用許多話來反對那種意見，只說如果是這樣情形，廣告費用是白化的；海格波特船長還是把那每星期事克龍（値二個半先令）的自已化用上算些。她聲明她不曉約他靠賴什麽過活。她的讑調，一定使他疑惑而有短時期心中難過。「人家都是這樣做的呀，」他指示出來。報紙有着全版專爲招尋失踪親屬的告白。他還要把報紙拿給她看。他和她得老婆曾給登過幾年的廣告；不過她是一個没有耐心的女人。從柯爾柏魯克得來的消息剛在他的喪事後一天；如果她不那般没有耐心，她現在也許還可到這地方來長久等待。「你不是一個没有耐心的女人吧，我的親愛的。」</p>
<p>「有時候我同你在一起，也要不能忍耐，」她總這樣回答。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>女權和法文</h3>
<p>— 皮</p>
<p>立法院外交委員會委員長傅秉常氏·前日由京赴港，道出滬江，離滬前他在輪次和某記者談及刑法第二三九條，關於通奸罪一層，頗饒趣味·（原文從略）我對於傅氏的談話，便發生兩個疑點（一）是女權問題的疑點·（二）是法文上的疑點·</p>
<p>最近二十餘年中，女權運動，極度高張，似乎女權的藐小，不知到了怎樣地步，查此次立法院第二次通過刑法審查案，有「有夫之婦，與人通奸者，處一年以下有期徒刑，相奸者亦同」·婦女界認爲這是侮辱女性的一種規定·大爲憤懣，聯合京外婦女界，入京請願·結果立法院重行複議，改爲「有配偶之人云云」·如此圓滿結果，若照歷史上看來，男子因或種問題，赴京請願，而能得如此美滿結果的，殊不多見，則女權並未見如何低落，此一事也·</p>
<p>傅氏又謂，「此案原本通過，取消不列入刑法内，嗣因立委之中，有一部份人，欲規定一中國自古以來數千年未變之慣例，（按卽指有夫之婦，與人通奸者，加以處罰）·於是遂有第二次刑法之審查通過·此次因婦女界之反對，重復討論時，復因有一部份委員，受其夫人等之反對，於是以前之主張規定千年慣例者，一反其以前之主張，反而要求平等規定」·照這樣看來，立法委員的「太太權」，實高出立委數倍，怎樣還要女權運動呢？此又一事也。</p>
<p>所謂女權運動者，因爲女權小於男權，夫權高於妻權，於是有男女平等的要求，現在女權高於一切，妻權勝於夫權，和事實完全相反·女權高於一切，原平自今日始，所謂「河東獅吼」「季常懼内」等等，在歷史上原不少風流證例，我想以後必定有人發起，作男權運動·以反抗女界者，恐也是意料中所或有的事·</p>
<p>又現在修正的條文，旣云「有配偶之人與人通奸者，處一年以下有期徒刑，相奸者亦同」·條文旣如此規定，則無配偶之人通奸，自不能援以爲例·假定有配偶之人，和無配偶之人通奸，則無配偶者，諒亦不爲罪，不能因爲和有配偶之人通奸，而亦同罹法綱也·條文規定，如此明白，而傅秉常氏云，「而妓女亦同犯該條所應得之罪」·我非但爲妓界代抱不平·並欲爲無配偶而和人相奸者抱屈，因爲娼妓的招待狎客，安能先知其配偶之有無？無配偶而與人相奸者，亦同一情形·故「相奸者亦同」一語，與文義上不免有所抵觸，因爲有配偶之人和無配偶之人通奸，其相奸者究同罪呢，還是異罪？這一點在法文上並没有明白規定，實是疑點·</p>
<p>若謂將來娼妓處境之困難，到也未必見得·祇要法文明白規定，無配偶者不在此例，或將「相奸者亦同」句取消，則在娼妓就有辦法·祇要門上貼一紅紙條。「本寓只招待無婦之客，有婦之客，恕不招待，特此聲明，尙乞原諒」，這樣一來，就不致無辜受罪了。</p>
<h3>論「欺」</h3>
<p>— 黎庵</p>
<p>我覺得中國人在世界上，是要算最能欺人，而也是最易受人欺的民族了丨所以「欺世盜名」之術，在中國最是風行；一個人只要有一分本領，而能再有九分「欺世盜名」之學，在社會上準是一個紅角兒；反之，任你有了九分眞學問，而没有一分「欺世盜名」的本領，一輩子也不容你出頭。這問題的根本癓結所在，是上下虚憍之氣太甚，凡事不肯務實際，只知道出風頭，在面子上用功夫。所以處這樣不景氣的年頭，服裝店還是新的不斷開出來；而銷路雖旺的報紙尙不到二十萬份。這是表示着，知識不過是蘊藏在心中，而服裝却是可以欺欺世人的好東西。</p>
<p>舉幾個例子吧！一個西洋的江湖術十跑到中國，掛起了敎授的銜頭，住一住華𢡟飯店，便有人會自願送錢給他。反之，城隍廟的王鐵嘴，雖然他也知道標榜「文王」「周公」，但在生意經上和敎授之類相差得多，王鐵嘴不曾在欺的一個字上用功夫，不及敎授之類看得透國人好欺心理，於是鐵嘴便吃了虧。在前幾個月吧！文壇上正鬧着文學遺產的問題，熱哄哄的大家拉牽高爾基，契珂夫等來做幌子。照我看來，中國的文學遺產似乎還是屈原莊孔等一流人物：但是倘使你有勇氣提出了屈原之流，决没有</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>人會瞧你一眼。高爾基契珂夫才時髦，一般大衆便會對你表示敬意。這種意識等於你跑到店裏去買東西，美國貨當然比中國貨好，而MadienChina，也似乎比在中國製造高明些；於是國貨烟草公司相率在出品上不印中文了！</p>
<p>因爲我不滿意現代的「美國式敎育」，曾數度提出採取「書字制度」來改善現代敎育，我曾化些功夫去研究過，覺得這種制度實是最合理，最天籟的敎育；和牛津式的敎育不相上下，採取這種制度實是救濟現代敎育的最好辦法。然而書院敎育制度不幸是產生在中國的，中國就根本没有好的制度。我寫好一篇關於書院制度的文字，拿去給一位朋友討論，他對我說：「你倘使要這篇文字引起人家的注意，第一就該改「書院制度」爲「牛津制度」，中國人是善欺人而善被人欺的民族，是以不可不欺一欺。」言下他一笑，我亦一笑。</p>
<p>記得某君曾說過：「中國之在難在於上下虚憍之氣太甚。」虚憍卽是不務實際，也是欺世盜名；今天提倡什麽，明天又來提倡一個，發宣言·做通電，當然有的是冠冕堂皇的一篇粉飾文章，試問若干事情這班提倡者自已能做到麽？</p>
<p>靠一個「欺」字寄生於社會的人在在都是，好像漆得金碧輝煌的馬子，擺在社會上做着欺騙的工作。他們標榜着博士留學生敎育家學者的銜頭，耀武揚威在人間世中幹鬼把戲，要是不把這些假面具揭穿，一切也没有救藥。</p>
<h3>計劃實現以後</h3>
<p>— 洪奔</p>
<p>說句歪曲的話，我這計劃之得以實現，是應相當的感謝那無名的小賊。若果我那一　皮袍子不被他偷走的話，這計劃今年準遠不會實現。因爲我素來是一個愛說不愛行的人，許多的事，心裏想得那麽周到·嘴邊說得那麽美俏，却總未見實行。這是老脾氣了，說出來心底眞是感到三分以上的慚愧。</p>
<p>去年，在某次宴會裏，因爲是着的一件不三不四的長衫，遭了人家一頓奚落，卽席我就在肚裏盤算一番，默默的發誓要做一套西裝。可可「時過心平」，到第二天就又忘記了。一來固然爲的是當時的「大那」入數不够我支配。但其實多半還是要歸咎於「懶得實行」。寗以後有宴會時，忽然想起没西裝穿，恐又要遭人家的奚落，停止赴約。</p>
<p>只有碰着「鐵面無情」的小賊，僅僅在五分鐘的疏忽裏，把我的皮袍子偷跑了，這才使我由「想」由「說」進而到草擬過一紙計劃書，到最近，西裝果然着上了身。</p>
<p>雖則已着上了身，但　有一段話果追述，那就是試穿時的一瓣心情。一向是那麽一個土裏土氣人的，今番着了挺直的西裝，心裏是怪慌顷的，在室中踱來踱去，總苦着第一脚没有勇氣踏出房門，其實走了出去，大家看了，也不過那麽無關的瞟視一眼而已。</p>
<p>不過心情究竟有些勿安：我總彷彷彿彿看見有人在注目我，議論我，甚至是諷刺我，說我這麽一個人，萬不應着這麽挺直的西裝。雖則西裝上身已是閱月矣，但此情此景則仍盤旋在我的週遭，繚繞在我的眼前，使我萬分的不安。</p>
<p>其次呢，就是平添了一種贅累。我原是一個隨便慣了的人，過去，不但衣飾不講究，而且不愛惜，糊裏糊塗，順手把衣袖抺台面，把衣襟兜特件，晚上和衣上床，那都是極平常的事。但現在可不興了，爲了要保持西裝的美觀性，走起路來要筆挺着背，下坐要先抹好凳上的灰塵，吃飯時要當心油漬滴上衣服。最使我痛苦的是卸衣臨睡之前，必要把褲縫折叠得十分安妥，才能安心上床，否則像過去的中裝褲那麽亂摔，迨到明早穿起來，折縫隱失了，那豈不是穿西裝者之笑話。</p>
<p>至於穿着時的麻煩，如領結打了又打，皮鞋抹了又抹，衣服刷了又刷，鏡子照了又照，還是小事，不必多述。</p>
<p>最近，還惹出了一種謠言，幾個常時接觸的同事，異口同聲的都說我太突變了，定有某種野心，不良企圖，這眞是天曉得咧！最惱人的是早幾天看見一個久别的朋友，他破口一聲就是：「聽說你現在談變愛了，穿了西裝是一個鐵證」。鵬來信更肯的說我已有了進程上的獲得。眞是活被寃枉。</p>
<p>至此我又感到西裝穿不得，至少像我這麽一個人。</p>
<h3>襪子的故事</h3>
<p>— 文黑</p>
<p>因爲閒着没有事，晚飯後便到馬路上去逛逛。</p>
<p>都會的夜裏是不夜之城，電燈是那麽的光亮，照得馬路上和白天差不多。還有，霓虹光在空中畫着圖案，寫着大字，紅的，緑的，紫的，藍的，五光十色，眩着人們的眼睛。我走着走着，走到一家雜貨店門口，在那裏站着許多同我一樣地在馬路的人，他們在聽門上的無線電播音，一陣蘇白在說書，我聽不懂，很想離開那裏；可是順眼望一望玻璃的飾窗，一些價錢便宜的日用品將我吸住了。兩磅量的熱水瓶，只要四角錢就够，想起以前曾經買過一塊錢一隻熱水瓶，悔不等一些時間到現在方來買。熱水瓶，家裏的桌子上已經放有了一隻，牠誘惑不了我的貪便宜的心。可是，也就因了熱水瓶的便宜，使我想要知道還有没有便宜貨可以買。哦，　子一元五雙，想起自家襪子只有一雙，而且前頭破一個洞，後跟亦破一個洞，就買牠一塊錢吧，自家够用之外，還可以給弟弟兩雙。打定了主意，踱進了牠的門，算是主顧來了，心裏獨自覺得好笑，一塊錢的主顧，有什麽神氣？這樣，也就自家謙虚起來，而且怪難爲情的好久不敢開口，可是夥計們對我却十分注意，一個穿長袍的先生跑來同我打招呼，「帽子？」他以爲我是要買帽子的。或者他以爲他店子的帽子最好吧。我掏着頭向他表示并不是要買帽子，但同時也將眼光向堆着許多帽子那邊瞟了一眼，下意識地要看一看他的帽子究竟是什麽樣子。瞟了一眼以後，馬上覺得應該答覆那夥計一句話才對，於是乎我說「襪子」，算是糾正了他的問話的錯誤，并且表示了我進了他店子的目的。這樣一來，他可忙個不了，而我也就神氣一些，自家覺得并不是進來逛逛的人，而是主顧。</p>
<p>時候已經是冬令，寒風還在街上嗚嗚的呌，也就難怪他要拿出羊毛襪子來給我看。我說不是這一種。可是要他拿出便宜貨的話，好久說不出來。他誤會我的意思了：以爲顏色不對。原先是黯赤色的，他另拿出一種淺黃色的來了。當他將盒子蓋上另外去拿别一種的時候，我已經覺得對他不起：現在他又將另一種盒子打開出來的時候，我還是不要，那不是太過令他燥急不高興了嗎？我急起來了，顧不了許多，直截了當地對他說，「一元五雙的。他却并不惱氣，對我微笑着說，「哦，有，有。」這樣一來，當他將一元五雙的襪子拿出來給我揀選的時候，我便覺得非買不可，不買大對不起人了。而且，同時還覺得便宜貨馬馬虎，揀選太過也不應該。交易便成功，我拿出一塊錢，他替我將五雙襪襪子包好。</p>
<p>出了店門，還聽到他的客氣話，下次會。我自家并没有回答他什麽話，可惹起了站在門口聽無綫電播音的人們的注意，一個個用羨慕與好奇的眼光望着我。</p>
<p>回到家裏，將襪子放下也就做了别事。可是明天一淸早起來將襪子穿上脚，用力一拉，破了！一連拉破了兩雙。幸而第三雙還没有破。可是我已經領敎了貪便宜的敎訓了。</p>
<h3>夜在動脈裏</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>時間，是動的，都會，是動的，人，是動的。</p>
<p>在夜的幕展開了以後，大都會的脈息在騷亂着，各處都張着大嘴狂吞着人，沿着這一陣風捲的屎息，人之羣滾動了。</p>
<p>「Darling」她在笑，這句話呌得怪甜的。</p>
<p>「丨丨哼，」放下了手裏的晚報，奔了過去，血液，像包圍不住這顆心，使牠不自主的跳躍。</p>
<p>軟軟地絲絨的沙發，玻璃板上的古銅色的台燈，繡着花的綿綾罩子，鵝黃的，那罩裏的光撲着他們的臉，多幸福的一對呵！</p>
<p>「我想······」再度地，她輕笑阗玩弄着窄窄地袖口，「到大上海云，好麽？」</p>
<p>馬路，在動亂着，人的脚，在動亂着，聲音，在動亂着······</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>「得，老　，老李，咱們　　的　一個夜宵吧！」</p>
<p>眞的，提到夜宵，就能使老張的心裏一動，他想，這該是正好的時候，天高氣爽，蟹肥菊黃，是應該放開了豪量痛飲一番的。</p>
<p>肥的蟹，眞够惹人流涎的，日昇樓的交叉口上，那靑灰色的大缸裏，一隻一隻地，瞧吧，多大，洋澄湖的。</p>
<p>圍着小的炭火，圍羊小的圓桌，揑着小的盅子！</p>
<p>「喝吧，盡量的喝吧！」隨着，咕嚕咕嚕的灌進　，臉紅着，心，炭火一樣的燙。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>在Dancing　hall裏：</p>
<p>都會的脈搏少許的靜止時候，挾着疲倦了的心情走出了辦公室的石階，不知怎麽，當那耀眼的光明接觸以後，疲倦就會逃走了的。</p>
<p>音樂，靡靡地嚮了，四下里，都黑下來，屋頂上，這回是緑色，陰沉沉地，像入睡的樣子。</p>
<p>丨丨舞吧，這頂上洒下來的是天的經，</p>
<p>，這靡靡地緯綫正是游手的幽魂呐丨</p>
<p>衣的香，粉的香，那一對對地，是愛的香呵。</p>
<p>可是，在夜的脈搏裏，也會從斜腰裏跳出幾個大漢！</p>
<p>丨丨𠯈，不許嚮，留下財來。也會不提防被拉住了衣服！</p>
<p>丨丨謝謝你，好吧，算八隻角子。</p>
<p>夜，就在這動的脈搏裏延續着。</p>

<h3>好萊塢的黃金兒</h3>
<p>— 細流</p>
<p>＝孩兒之價百五十倍於黃金＝</p>
<p>＝生育費用不可以常理計算＝</p>
<p>有人說，凡是生在好萊塢電影明星家裏的孩子，他或她的身價，是和與他或她的體重同等的黃金一樣的。但是倘若我們更加詳密的計算，就可以知道一個孩子，生在一個女明星的懹裏的比和它的身體同重的黃金還要貴一百五十倍。你說這是没有根據的話嗎？好吧，比方一個孩子生下來是十磅重，照它的同重的黃金計算，它祇値五萬八千美金。但是它的確實價値，却不下一百萬美金。這不是要比和它的身體同重的黃金，還要貴一百五十倍而不止嗎？我們就以瓊勃朗篇兒的孩子說吧。我們計算一個孩子的價錢，不僅限於一個孩子的生產費和養育費，我們一定還要加上，因爲有了孩子，而不得不用的錢，或是倘使没有孩子，而可以節省，以及可以多賺的錢在内。這樣，瓊因爲生孩子，而受的薪水損失，已經是三萬五千元了。影片公司的合同，大槪是可以照分娩期的長短而延長的。所以倘使一個女明星因生產而休息了一年，她的合同亦就展期一年，直到那合同原定期限完畢爲止。這其間的薪水損失，是可以拿紙筆來計算的，但是她實在所受的損失，却不止此數，而是無從加以統計的。你們要知道電影觀衆的她惡，是很容易變遷的。要是年輕的女明星，因爲生孩子而於身體方面有了影響，那損失就極大。要是她脫離銀幕太久了，觀衆們遺忘了她的名字，或者加有新進的女明星，奪去了她的位置，那末她的損失之大，眞是不可思議，或者竟是終身莫贖的了。</p>
<p>有人計算，她萊塢一個女明星，因爲分娩而停止工作的時間，大槪總須八個月之久丨分娩之前三個月，和分娩之後五個月。但是許多女明星，却要費去了一年或一年半之久，爲生一個孩子。據海倫黛惠芙德麗的計算，她生一個兒子，以極短的時間的損而論，已不下十萬元。瓊考麗爾爲生兒子，休諱了三年，現在要回到銀幕上去，覺得十分困難。克萊拉寳因爲要生孩子，不得不拒絶了許多肥美的合同。</p>
<p>再則生孩子的費用，普通人以爲是女明星自已担負的。其實，影片公司方面的損失，亦是極大的。在瓊勃朗麗黛兒分娩之前拍她最後一張影片的時候，公司裏替他預備的特别設備，是很可觀的。並且每天工作的時間微短，許多配角以及工作人等，都要隨她的時間行事。所以瓊勃朗黛爾生一個孩子，公司裏面的種種損失，已經要數十萬元了。據說好萊塢影片公司拍片子的時候，每分鐘要費到三百美金。要是拍大塲面的時候，損失還不止此。在瓊拍（Sames)的時候，到底耗費了多少分鐘，已是無從計算了，但是說多耗數十萬塊錢，那不是絶對没有理由的。</p>
<p>兩個男明星，平克勞斯貝和哈羅勞易，曾爲他們的孩子，化過許多特别的錢。那當然是個例外，但是亦可以知道電影明星的能化錢了。哈羅勞易說，他有錢的好處，祇有在他孩子生下來的時候才知道。他倘使没有錢，他的孩子就不能生存了。原來他的孩子是個小產，一定要將它放置在玻璃的人工孵卵器裏，用棉花包好，慢慢地敎給它呼吸咆東西。那是科學上最名貴的器具，惟有最有錢的人才用得起了。平克勞斯貝的孿生子，亦是早生的。生下的時候，每人祇有四磅重，但是用了同樣的方法，至今還活着哩。至於生產時的醫院費，明星們所付的，亦比普通人貴十倍。她們僱着特别的看護，一天分三班替換着。此外還有許多要請敎醫學專家的地方，費用之大，言之更覺駭人了。</p>
<p>此外更大的一筆費用，就是安全費。好萊塢的綁匪，以及明星們如何防衛他們兒女的方法，我們已經聽見得多了。瑪琳黛德麗許特爲她女兒的安全，親自送她到歐洲去。其餘的明星，僱用保鏢，或添置防禦的設備，可云煞費苦心。但是這裏我們就不談了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「巧點鴛鴦譜」</h3>
<p>— 石斧</p>
<p>“Judge　Priest”大上海映</p>
<p>「幽默」兩字流行到了中國，我們誰都知道英國的蕭伯訥，可是還有一位在美國好蘭塢，賺一等大薪水，名震銀壇的大幽默家，惠爾羅傑士，却還没有被我們國人所認識。這位幽默大師是絶對保守美國人的信條，和平爲第一，他往往微言解紛，而經他的人生眞諦一來，便可化干戈爲玉帛，我們在他過去主演的片子裏，可以了解他是這樣的一位妙人，好像比蕭伯訥的故意刻劃，斵喪元氣的諷刺，還要來得高一格哩。</p>
<p>這一「巧點鴛鴦譜」，我們要知道它是從小說中摘出一些關於裁判官畢土德的個性，來改編成的。我們不啻可以當作軼事看，我們可以看到這位法官是一個極富情感，而同情於大衆的，差不多他的個性是與法政很矛盾的。因此，這裏我們便有好戲看了，他是抱着「剖斗折衡而民不爭」的止訟原理去審案，又替人們做月下老人的工作，使有情的都成眷屬，表面雖是詼諧玩世，實際上他是一個含着眼涙而笑的人。</p>
<p>美國的南北之戰，誠然是可以歌頌的光榮戰史，那時的搴旗斬將的英雄，都是爲自由而戰，確是比什麽世界大戰要有價値得多。這裏用這戰事來暗櫬全劇的主旨，是很可喜的。爲了恐怕這樣故事的演出戰調，所以配奏着許多永久熱烈的SouthernMelodies如MyKentuckyHome,OldFolksatHome,Dixie,MarchingThrcoghGeorgia增加了觀衆不少的愉快，尤其是這類的歌，一定要黑人歌唱的。</p>
<p>穿揷的詼諧，很合幽默條件，和尋常的滑稽戲迴然不同，吃冰其林同拉糖的Party很新奇。配角也都是老手，所以相得益彰。</p>
<p>這是一張値得介紹的片子。</p>
<h3>你知道麽？</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>曾在希佛萊的「瀟湘夜深時」初次出現銀幕，而得到盛名的，好萊塢最可愛的童星李勞埃，現在剛滿一歲，可是他已經貯蓄着，足以畢業大學爲止的學費了。</p>
<p>據好萊塢穿禮服之第一能手亞道夫孟郁說，假使你要做位紳土的話，你應該穿载伯是，賈里古柏的大衣，羅惠爾夏曼的帽子，羅勃蒙高茂萊的領帶，威廉包惠爾的褲子，和克拉佛普羅克的皮鞋。</p>
<p>現在美國最紅的明星。說來使你不相信，就是今年不過四歲的秀蘭鄧波兒呀！固然她是决不會讀片中的對白的；可是她却能够比普通的演員，更快地背熟那對白。她的方法是：先由她的母親很仔細地把對白讀二次給她聽，然後再由她自已照樣地說一次，這樣她已經背熟了。</p>
<p>梅蕙絲一共有十五件不同樣子的平常衣裳。她每天從其中換一件衣裳穿的。每星期她要修三次手指，固然都是塗得粉紅的。在她家中連一件睡衣亦没有，所有的都是那種奢侈的夜禮服吧了！</p>
<p>喬治勃郎從前是在馬戲班裏出身的，所以最近在上海開映的「胡塗幸福」就是他的自傳。</p>
<p>卡洛朗白在女學時代，是個聞名的跳高選手。</p>
<p>約翰包爾斯在他的新片「威斯特的一生」中曾舉行結婚禮：這可說是他在銀幕上「最初」的結婚。</p>
<p>德格拉斯蒙高美萊的牙齒是好萊塢最白。</p>
<h3>「逃亡」假戲眞做</h3>
<p>— 靑雲</p>
<p>「逃亡」自從張家口拍取外景歸來後，昨晚復撮製「九一八」事變中東北人民逃難一幕。導演岳楓唐納爲求戰景逼眞起見，事前特爲定製與眞炸彈形狀相同内含輕量火藥之假炸彈數百枚。此炸彈雖非眞正炸彈，但若猛力向地上抛擲，卽能爆炸，亦有毁壞能力。當昨夜撮製此一幕「九一八」東北事變内景時，由王引袁美雲，倉隱秋，葉娟娟，秦桐，金杏庵等扮飾東北人民。其他數十男演員則扮飾某國軍人，紛向東北逃難人民抛擲炸彈。一時轟炸之聲與難民呼號啼哭之聲打成一片，情景逼眞。公司四面鄰居，聞聲疑爲戰事重起，慌張未敢安睡。不料正在此緊張之時，有數炸彈意向葉娟娟秦桐金杏庵三人臉部擲來，當聽轟然一聽，三人臉部均被炸傷，痛極倒地。旋由人扶起，急送附近醫院醫治。因傷並不十分利害，故由醫生敷藥包紥後，卽行出院云。（却）</p>
<h3>「重婚」的話</h3>
<p>— 火</p>
<p>『重婚』不單是導演的技巧成功，不單是攝影的光綫美麗，每個演員的表情亦有着優越的貢獻，它無疑的是中國影壇的一部超特作。</p>
<p>老高和小高在這兒是一對美滿的夫妻，小高飾一個舊式家庭中的封建女子，老高正和她的相反，是一個性好風流的摩登大學生，在這種一新一舊的思想衝突下，於是造成了種種的悲劇，老高以重婚和遣棄罪入獄了，損失的賠償，和贍養的負担，使整個的家庭亦破產了。我們可以看見許多没靈魂的肉體在蠕動許多痛苦的陰影在爬行。導演是曾經轟動過中國影壇的『風』的導演吳村，『風』在四把剪刀的摧殘下，使我們不能全暴，這次在重婚中我們可以看見導演者的『盧山眞面了』。（却）</p>

<h3>母女緣（Lady　by　Choice）（二）</h3>
<p>— 仲嘉</p>
<p>庭長一壁聽着那個賣唱的陳述他的案情，一壁忍住了笑。他心裏恨不得他在當塲，親眼看見潘茜喝醉了酒，怒氣勃勃地去打那唱歌的人。但是他却不敢讓潘茜知道他心裏的高興，她已經大放肆得過份了。他於是厲聲同潘茜道：「你爲什麽要打他」？潘茜兩隻手撑着腰，膯着眼喊道：「爲什麽？他唱着母親歌哩」！突然間法庭的後面起了一陣笑聲，還有小手拍掌的聲音。達理庭長抬起頭來，望着拍掌的地方瞧過去，他不覺將嘴唇咬緊了。他看見的是一個年輕的女郎，身上鬆鬆地披上一件皮大衣，一隻手拿了一把大駝羽的扇子。他怎麽會不認識她呢，全城各小報都登過她的照片，人人都聽見過她的名字，人人都讀過她的新聞。她就是亞拉班李，在紐約轟動一時的羽扇跳舞家，在她旁邊詀着的，是她的舞台經理肯道爾，和一個警察。後面還跟着她的宣傳員佛郎脫。達理庭長眼睛看着亞拉班的時候，亞拉班還在看着潘茜儍笑哩。或者亞拉班聽見了潘茜的厭惡母親歌，而向她表示同情哩。或者她覺得潘茜，就是她年老後的一個素描畫像。她覺得潘茜年輕的時候，一定是和她自已一樣，心直嘴快，嫉惡虚僞，一些不容人的。她亦看出潘茜年輕的時候，一定亦是和她自已一樣的豐神艶麗，因爲她的一雙眼睛，雖然已經花老了，但還剩留着緑色的餘輝，她蓬鬆的亂髮，起初亦一定是黃澄澄賽過純金的，她的嘴，雖然兩隻角已經被歲月風霜望下拉了下去，但從前亦一定是很惹人動情的。她想着不覺害怕起來，要是她自已老了，亦一定就變成潘茜那副神氣了，除非蒼天有什麽特别的法力，可以阻擋住那種變化。將來男人看見了她，亦會漸漸將笑容歛住了。或者現在喝着提神的酒，將來亦會成了她每天的飯糧。或者她亦會飢寒交迫，轉展溝壑起來，亞拉班對着潘茜好像看着一面麽鏡，將她的將來　毫畢現地映射了出來，就不覺不寒而憟起來。但是她正在想入非非的時候，潘茜亦正在向着她笑。於是她就不覺又拍手笑起來。達理庭長聽了，勃然大怒，將木榔頭鐺鐺敲着桌子，大聲喊着：「不要作聲」，他的眼睛，惡狠狠的釘了亞拉班一眼，然後又問潘茜道：「爲什麽他不可以唱母親歌呢」？潘茜給庭長一問，不覺又暴怒起來，祇聽見她喊道：「這個不要臉的東西，他的母親活着的時候，常常將她毒打。他一年以前，他又遺棄了他的妻和三個孩子。所以等到他唱到「母親溫暖的慈輝，從她的眼睛裏射出來」一節的時候，我就忍不住跳了起來要攅他。庭長，你亦會要這樣的，是不是」？庭長心裏忖度着，那亦怪不得潘茜。奇怪的潘茜····可憐的潘茜，她具有一片忠肝義膽，却不免左右被人控告。或者他以前的可憐她，將她釋放，是錯用的寛仁，以致反害了她。這個老太婆實在不能當心她自已了。最好能够給她找到一個，安全的地方，天天有飯給她吃，天天有澡給她洗，夜夜有枕頭墊着頭，絨毯蓋着身體。他於是厲聲叱道：「你知道一年之中，你來到這裏幾次了」？潘茜没有回答。庭長替她計算道：「七次了，是不是？上一次我釋放你的時候，你就答應我不再喝一滴酒的。你已經屢次說過不再喝酒。你現在又洶酒滋事了」！（未完）</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Sun Ke and Wang Chonghui, accompanied by Fu Bingchang, Yang Huabai, Zhu Shouyong, and Ma Kun, the representative sent by Chen Jitang to Beijing to welcome them, returned on the French mail ship Atdos and arrived in Hong Kong at 7 PM on the evening of the third. Cheng Tiangu and others, as well as Hu Hanmin's daughter Mulan, went to welcome them. They disembarked at 7:30 PM and stayed at the Gloucester Hotel. At 8 PM, they had dinner at the Datong Restaurant, where Wang Chonghui met with more than 30 Chinese and foreign reporters and discussed in detail the mission of coming south. At 8:30 PM, he went to Conduit Road to meet with Hu Hanmin, and plans to enter the province with Xiao Focheng within the next few days to meet with Chen Jitang and others, and rush to return to Beijing before the eighth to attend the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. (Third Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren is scheduled to leave Yong on the third and come to Hong Kong to meet with Hu Hanmin and Sun Ke and Wang Chonghui. He is expected to arrive on the fourth. Xiao Focheng telegraphed the province from Hong Kong on the evening of the first to report. Xiao will return to the province after meeting with Sun and Wang. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Chonghui and Sun Ke arrived here on the French liner at 7 PM tonight.

The Guangzhou officials acknowledge that the visit of Sun and Wang is related to the cooperation between Ning and Yue. Zou Lu told reporters today that Wang may visit the province after meeting with Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong, but it is not certain whether Sun Ke will accompany him. (Third Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Southwest Executive Committee met today to discuss the overall situation, but no resolutions were made. The Fifth Plenary Session of the National Congress will be held in Beijing on December 10. The situation may change rapidly, so everyone feels that the visit of Sun and Wang is extremely important. Sun and Wang are quite optimistic about the prospects for peace. It is hoped that the results of the meeting between Sun and Wang and Hu in Hong Kong will enable them to come to the province to complete the plan for national unity. As for the Southwest Political Committee sending representatives to Hong Kong to formally welcome Sun and Wang, it seems to indicate that the Southwest is willing to consider the suggestions of the central government. The leaders of the Southwest military are quite in favor of peace, so if Hu Hanmin can accept Nanjing's proposal, peace can be easily achieved. (Third Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Puppets Hold Immigration Conference in Changchun</h3>
<p>(Beiping) News from outside the Pass: El Salvador's illegal recognition of Manchukuo is actually hoping to gain commercial convenience. El Salvador's specialty is only coffee, which is difficult to sell in various parts of Manchukuo. Therefore, the result is only that the Manchukuo government ordered 13 bags of coffee, with a value of only 1,300 yuan. The Japanese puppets held an immigration conference in Changchun. After several days of discussion, three principles have been decided: 1. The national structures for the control of Japanese and Manchurian immigrants are two: one is established in Tokyo, Japan, and one is established in Changchun. 2. The control of Manchurian immigrants is placed under the control of Manchukuo, so that orders can be issued for land acquisition, colonization, and financial guidance. 3. The selection of immigration sites should be selected naturally, economically, and socially. It is reported that this immigration conference will focus on methods in the future to avoid attacks by the Volunteer Army. If the Japanese side is successful in studying immigration methods, then the fertile fields on the border of Liaoning and Jilin will no longer be owned by the country.

<p>— Central and National Government Weekly Memorial Service Reports</p>
<p>Cheng Tianfang····The Path to National Revival</p>
<p>Tan Zhen····Reflections on Observations in Europe and America</p>
<p>(Nanjing dispatch) The Central Government held its 199th weekly memorial service at 9 AM on the 3rd. Around 600 people attended, including Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Li Ciwen, Cheng Tianfang, Deng Jiayan, Hong Ludong, Xiao Jirui, Li Zonghuang, and all staff members. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. Cheng Tianfang gave a report on "The Path to National Revival," stating that in the last century, China has suffered successive failures in diplomacy and has also been subjected to economic aggression. To achieve revival, there are two paths to take: 1. Cultivate national self-defense capabilities. We all know that national combat power is an essential factor for maintaining national survival. Currently, all major powers in the world pay attention to national military strength. Countries such as Germany, Italy, the United States, and Russia are promoting military training for the people, even using live ammunition shooting as a game. The reason for our weakness is largely due to the lack of self-defense capabilities and courage among the people. The self-defense capabilities of the people should not be ignored. 2. Promote the determination of national self-confidence. The Chinese nation is rich in the ability to create culture and has a history of over 4,000 years. Unfortunately, since the Song Dynasty, the national creative spirit has been declining, and its self-confidence has been lost. To achieve revival, we must first vigorously promote the inherent virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, as well as the political philosophy of investigating things, extending knowledge, rectifying the mind, making the will sincere, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under heaven. We should believe that this inherent culture is sufficient to save the country and achieve revival. The above two tasks have a great mission, and the people of the whole country should take on these. Followers of the Three Principles of the People should work together. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing dispatch) The National Government held its weekly memorial service on the morning of the 3rd. Over 500 people attended, including He Yingqin, Tan Zhen, Deng Jiayan, Wang Yongbin, Chen Xunyong, Lin Xiang, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, and Wei Huai, as well as officials from various ministries and departments. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Tan Zhen reported on his impressions of observing justice in Europe and America, stating that although the period of observation in Europe was short, he gained much. Briefly speaking, the tension in the European situation is far beyond domestic imagination. Since the Great War, all countries, in order to seek their own survival, have been actively preparing to strengthen their national defense to cope with future wars. The enthusiasm of their people is not relaxed. The international struggle is now extremely fierce. Once war breaks out, the superficial peace situation will be torn apart. Although the League of Nations wants to maintain a peaceful situation, Europe itself is in a precarious state and has no time to pay attention to the Far East. The reason why Japan dares to invade our country lies in this. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has faced a serious national crisis. I deeply feel that the whole country must be united, strive for unity, and develop national resources to strengthen national power in order to fight for the survival of the nation and the country. The difficult environment in Germany is no less than that in our country, and the spirit of the Germanic nation striving bravely for the survival of the country is what our people should learn from. The unity spirit of the German National Socialist Party far surpasses Bismarck. The German people's belief in Bismarck is like our people's belief in President Sun. Germany's policy is also what Bismarck left behind. Everyone can fully express the spirit of iron and blood. Bismarck's political thought was influenced by Eastern Confucianism, so the Germans are actively studying Eastern culture as a basis for the expansion of the German nation. It is painful that our country does not pay attention to its inherent culture. Furthermore, the compulsory labor that Germany has implemented can not only train the physical fitness of the national population but also cultivate the habit of cooperation, which is what our country should learn from. Tan concluded by saying that our country should incorporate the spirit of all of President Sun's teachings into national law so that the people can all understand this spirit and promote it to society.

<h3>The Key to Sino-Japanese Amity</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London stated that a leader of a British party, Lansbury, expressed his opinion that if he were in China's position, he would be very willing to befriend Japan. At the same time, he also advised Japan to abandon its policy of military aggression against China and seek the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity between the two countries with an attitude of mutual assistance and friendship. Lansbury's opinion coincides with Chiang Kai-shek's remarks to Japanese reporters a few days ago. Chiang Kai-shek said, "Only on the basis of morality and trust can China and Japan resolve all issues. The key lies with Japan, not with China." A careful reading of the two men's words is enough to clarify each other's points. Lansbury emphasizes the mutual concessions of both parties, while Chiang Kai-shek emphasizes Japan's prior repentance. Their hope for international peace is equally strong.</p>
<p>Our eagerness to see Sino-Japanese amity is the same as that of peace-loving people in the world. However, we believe that future Sino-Japanese amity, as Chiang Kai-shek said, "the key lies solely with Japan." Today, the world knows that Japan is strong and we are weak. However, even if we befriend them with utmost sincerity, if they still do not abandon their established policies, what good will it do? Moreover, the relationship between countries is no different from that between individuals. If A infringes upon the property of B, thereby leading to mutual animosity, then the best way to restore their original friendly relations is for A to return the infringed property. If this is not done, and B is forced to express goodwill to A, no matter how reluctantly B expresses it, it will not be enough to convey sincere acceptance. Even if B can forget old grievances, how can A be convinced? A will definitely think that this is B's "hypocritical mask," waiting for an opportunity to act. Therefore, if countries truly want to establish sincerity and trust, there is no other way but for the stronger party to abandon its acts of aggression. In the future, if we want to improve Sino-Japanese relations through peaceful means, Japan must be the one to initiate it. This is why.</p>
<p>The reason why I say that the Japanese cannot befriend China with sincerity and often suspect that China is wearing a mask is not without reason. Let us cite the words of the Japanese newspapers as proof.</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun in Japan published an article on November 1 entitled "Wang Jingwei's Diplomacy is Nothing But a Pretense." It said that Wang Jingwei's slogan of "resisting and negotiating with Japan at the same time" is a hypocritical mask for China's attempt to seek temporary peace and an opportunism to perfunctorily deal with Japan. If Japan encounters international danger, it will change its policy towards Japan. Moreover, the European and American factions always want to use the power of Europe and the United States to defeat Japan. Therefore, Japan should immediately show its righteousness and power to prompt China to reflect on itself.</p>
<p>This is proof of what I said earlier about Japan's lack of sincerity. The goal of diplomacy for all countries in the world must be to ensure the safety of their own country and to maintain world peace. The use of diplomatic policies should be adapted to the times and is not unchangeable. There is no need for a mask or so-called opportunism. The diplomatic goal of our country is precisely this. Therefore, all countries in the world that can treat us with fairness and integrity will be befriended with sincerity. There is no such thing as being pro-European or pro-American or pro-Japanese. The newspaper's remarks are simply intended to provoke. If Japan truly intends to seek Sino-Japanese friendship and rebuild friendly relations between the two countries, it should first have a major epiphany and express respect for China's sovereignty. Then, this stalemate will naturally be easily broken. If they merely make speculations and play tricks, Sino-Japanese relations will inevitably deteriorate and there will be no chance for rapprochement. The key to this, as Chiang Kai-shek said, lies with Japan, not with us.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Lodge Protests with Japan Again</h3>
<p>(Nanjing dispatch) Britain and the United States have again lodged protests with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the issue of petroleum control in "Manchukuo." However, this problem cannot be resolved between governments, and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that British and American oil companies will start negotiations directly with "Manchukuo."

<h3>US Army Tests New Type of Tank</h3>
<p>(Washington dispatch) The Army General Staff is currently testing a new type of tank. This tank weighs eight tons, runs on caterpillar wheels, and can reach a speed of 96 kilometers per hour. During combat, its speed is between 50 and 80 kilometers. It is generally expected that the Army Department will order this new type of tank in large quantities. (Havas dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Deadlocked Naval Negotiations: Concerted Efforts by the United States, Britain, and Japan</h3>
<p>Japan Presents Technical Plan to the United States</p>
<p>Tokyo Cabinet Decides to Unilaterally Abandon Naval Treaty</p>
<p>(London dispatch) The next move in the naval talks among Britain, the United States, and Japan will be a meeting between the US representative Standley and the Japanese representative Yamamoto. It is believed that Yamamoto will take this opportunity to explain the technical plan for qualitative limitations to the US representative. Yamamoto has already informed British Naval Chief of Staff Chatfield of this plan on November 30. Today, the US delegation will host a luncheon for the British and Japanese representatives. British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, Naval Chief of Staff Backhouse, Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira, and Japanese representatives Yamamoto and Iwashita are all on the guest list. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London dispatch) The US delegation is adhering to its current ratio and is taking a tough stance, repeatedly threatening to end these preliminary consultations. However, after seven weeks, progress on technical details is still being made among the representatives of Britain, the United States, and Japan. The basis of discussion is still the British government's compromise proposal, especially regarding the content of the declaration of autonomy and the qualitative limitations of the forces held by each country. Specialized discussions are continuing. Apart from the declaration of autonomy, the British government does not oppose setting a maximum limit for the amount of forces held by each country. The representatives' opinions seem to be consistent on this point. As for the maximum amount of forces held, Britain and the United States advocate a total of around one million tons, which is still far from the Japanese arms reduction benchmark system that hopes to drastically reduce arms. If they confront Britain and the United States in an attempt to achieve equalization, the Japanese government will ultimately need to expand its military equipment to a considerable extent, which Japan will never agree to. Regarding other issues such as qualitative limitations, Representative Yamamoto has already met with Admiral Chatfield. The most difficult person to deal with is Admiral Standley, the head of the US delegation. The Japanese side has now decided not to talk to many people and intends to take a blitzkrieg approach. Representative Yamamoto has applied to meet with the admiral, but the US delegation stated that it can only discuss nominal equalization and absolutely opposes actual equalization, and must withdraw to its home country before the winter solstice. Given the above situation, it is still extremely difficult for the representatives of the United States and Japan to come to an agreement. If the Japanese government abolishes the Washington Naval Treaty, they will resolutely withdraw. This determination has already been expressed, and Foreign Secretary Simon has repeatedly tried to mediate, but there has been no result from his meeting with Davis. In the end, it seems that the plan to unilaterally retain the Pacific defense restriction clause has also been withdrawn. Therefore, the preliminary consultations will not end immediately and will continue for the time being with the three expert representatives focusing on numerical negotiations.

<h3>Japanese Emergency Cabinet Meeting Decides to Unilaterally Abandon Treaty</h3>
<p>Adopting the Procedure of Consulting the Privy Council</p>
<p>Italy and France Are Not Deceived</p>
<p>(Tokyo dispatch) The issue of abandoning the Washington Naval Treaty was formally decided at an emergency cabinet meeting in the Diet at noon today, adopting the procedure of consulting the Privy Council. However, the Privy Council, considering the importance of the issue, will have a review committee examine it in detail with great care. It is expected to be passed at the Privy Council's main meeting on the 19th. Once formally decided, the government will immediately instruct Saito, the ambassador to the United States, to hand over the text of the abandonment notice to Secretary of State Hull. The date may be on the 20th. Moreover, this notice only simply states that, in accordance with Article 3 of the Washington Naval Treaty, the treaty has now expired and is therefore being abandoned. After Ambassador Saito hands over the notice to Secretary Hull, the Imperial Government will issue a simple and straightforward statement to domestic and foreign parties regarding the reasons for notifying the abandonment, clarifying the Imperial Government's policy. (Dispatch from the 3rd by Denpo News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo dispatch) At 12:30 PM today, the government held an emergency cabinet meeting in the Diet and decided to abandon the Washington Naval Treaty using the procedure of notification, i.e., consulting the Privy Council. The government then immediately submitted it in writing. Although the Italian ambassador to Japan did not visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Italian government's intention to refuse the invitation to jointly abandon the treaty is clear. Therefore, the procedure of unilateral abandonment was adopted. (Dispatch from the 3rd by Dentsu News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo dispatch) The Navy authorities' intention regarding the decision to abandon the Washington Naval Treaty is as follows:</p>
<p>The abandonment of the Washington Naval Treaty and the fair and appropriate arms reduction policy established by the Imperial Government are a natural conclusion. Therefore, once the cabinet decides, it will soon notify the countries concerned. The purpose of the abandonment is only to establish a procedure for a world peace agreement and a genuine arms reduction agreement. Therefore, even after notifying the abandonment, the government will continue friendly negotiations with the countries concerned on the arms reduction issue as before.

<h3>Japan Plans Post-Abandonment Measures after Washington Naval Treaty Abolished</h3>
<p>Intends to Continue Negotiations with Britain and the United States</p>
<p>To Conclude a New Treaty to Replace the Old One</p>
<p>(Tokyo dispatch) The Japanese government has decided to announce the abandonment of the treaty in the middle of this month. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is particularly concerned that after abandoning the treaty, it will fall into international isolation. As a result of the leaders' discussions, the following post-abandonment measures have been decided: 1. The military equipment plan proposed by Japan for the preliminary talks will be promoted regardless of whether the preliminary talks break down or the treaty is abandoned, in order to implement its original intention. After the breakdown, Japan will gladly participate in the continuing committee proposed by Britain. At the same time as notifying the abandonment, it will also decide to advocate a cessation of the naval construction race and that the regular arms reduction conference next year must be held. 2. It is hoped that there will be no effective negotiations on the quantitative problem of national defense military strength. From now on, it will continue to negotiate with the contracting countries on qualitative issues from a technical perspective. 3. When negotiations on both quantitative and qualitative aspects fail, it will notify the countries that Japan is prepared to conclude bilateral or multilateral treaties with each country to prevent arms expansion or non-aggression treaties. For example, the current Four-Power Treaty still exists, and a new treaty will be concluded to expand its content. 4. All political negotiations on the Manchurian problem will be firmly rejected. However, if Japan is recognized as a stabilizing force in East Asia and its superior position is established as a prerequisite without proposing compensatory conditions, if so, Japan will strengthen the East Asian peace mechanism and can conclude new guarantee treaties with various countries.

<h3>Britain Withdraws Compromise Proposal Due to US Opposition</h3>
<p>Pacific Defense and Existing Ratios</p>
<p>US Representatives Believe They Cannot Be Separated</p>
<p>(London dispatch) The British government has proposed a compromise proposal, arguing that the following conditions of the Washington Naval Treaty should be retained even after it expires: 1. Various conditions regarding qualitative restrictions; 2. Article 19 regarding Pacific defense work; 3. Regulations on notification of naval construction plans. However, the US delegation opposed the British proposal because it argued that restrictions on Pacific defense work and existing ratios cannot be separated. As a result, the British government recently withdrew the compromise proposal. (Dispatch from the 2nd by Japanese United News)</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy: Consolidating Hegemony in Asia</h3>
<p>Japan-Russia Relations Only Superficially Amicable</p>
<p>Navy Seeks to Implement the Principle of Equality</p>
<p>丨丨Editorial in Le Temps of Paris丨丨</p>
<p>(Paris dispatch) Le Temps published an editorial commenting on Japan's policy, stating that Germany's diplomatic activities in the capitals of European countries are attracting much attention from Europeans. However, we must not ignore the situation developing in the Far East due to Germany's activities. Japan's aim is to overturn the traditional power of European countries in the Far East. What the Tokyo government is now committed to is not only the naval issue but also to consolidate the "Manchukuo" it created with extremely resolute actions. It is also thinking of consolidating the superior position it has gained in the areas related to the fate of Asia. Le Temps then discussed the recent declaration made by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota to the House of Peers, saying that the general public believes that there will soon be an armed conflict. This is absolutely unbelievable. The Japanese would rather adopt a flexible diplomatic approach that adapts to the times to seek progress. The diplomatic method is certainly slower, but its results are more reliable, and Japan's diplomacy has already achieved results, which is encouraging Japan to continue. For example, relations between Japan and Russia were very tense before, but now unexpected incidents in the fishing industry no longer occur, and there is hope for a resolution of the issue of the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway. All of this shows the improvement in relations between the two countries. "The statement that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are becoming good has come from the mouth of Foreign Minister Hirota. This situation is more favorable than the tense situation a few months ago, but the political problems between Japan and Russia in the Far East have not yet been resolved." Le Temps then discussed the London naval talks, saying that "What Japan seeks is not actually to fundamentally abolish various naval treaties in order to freely build a strong navy. Japan's intention is only to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty and conclude a new treaty that stipulates a common maximum tonnage so that each country can have a naval force that can truly meet its national defense needs. "A new compromise plan has been discovered in the London negotiations, indicated by Japan. The general idea is to advocate the conclusion of a ten-year agreement, in which Britain, the United States, and Japan will continue to implement their naval construction plans in the first five years. From the sixth year onwards, Britain and the United States should stop, while Japan should continue to build ships so that its naval power gradually increases until it is equal to that of Britain and the United States. (Note: The actual naval forces of Britain, the United States, and Japan have not reached the numbers set by the 5:5:3 ratio set by the Washington Naval Treaty. The so-called continuation of shipbuilding in the first five years is to make the actual naval power of the three countries reach the 5:5:3 ratio. From the sixth year onwards, Britain and the United States will maintain the numbers of 5:5 and cannot increase them, while Japan will continue to build ships in order to gradually increase from 5:5:3 to 5:5:5.) From this plan, we can also see the characteristics of Japan's policy and diplomacy, namely, it does not want to break away, but it will never give up its goals. Its method of proceeding is to strive for the point that can be reached at present. (Dispatch from the 3rd by Havas)</p>
<h3>US Should Receive British and French Islands in the West Indies</h3>
<p>To Offset War Debts Owed to the US</p>
<p>There Is a Precedent from the Netherlands</p>
<p>Suggestion from Former US Ambassador to Turkey</p>
<p>(Paris dispatch) Former US Ambassador to Turkey, General Sherrill, suggested that the US receive the British and French-owned islands in the Caribbean to offset war debts and cited the takeover of the Dutch West Indies as a precedent for this matter, saying it would be of great benefit to solving the war debt stalemate. Sherrill also expressed support for Secretary of State Hull's war debt meeting with the United Kingdom, expressing particular sympathy for the point that there is no need to pay debts in cash. Although the United States did not get an inch of land in the Versailles Treaty, a country's colony can easily be transferred to jurisdiction. The British and French will also benefit from this. Today's Democratic Party leaders can use President Wilson's purchase of the Dutch West Indies as a precedent. The British and French have no interests in this island. They can be used as naval anchorages but have no target for attack. (Dispatch from the 3rd by National News)</p>

<h3>Opening of the French Colonial Economic Conference</h3>

<p>(Paris) Many important figures have gathered here for an economic conference. The French themselves are calling this conference the French Ottawa Conference. When the opening ceremony is held today, French President Lebrun will also attend. Representatives include governors and administrators from various French colonies, members of both houses of parliament, and prominent business leaders. Preparations for this conference have been underway for two years, but it is expected to last at least three months after its opening. The conference has several important objectives, one of which is the control and rationalization of production. Another is to investigate existing resources and future possibilities. It will also focus on the centralization of information from various regions and the harmonization of conflicting interests. This conference is said to be a cornerstone in French history.

<p>(Paris) The Economic Conference of Metropolitan France and its colonies opened today. President Lebrun, in his opening speech, stated that after a long period of preparation, it is hoped that the scattered French territories across the five continents will regain prosperity as a result. Colonial Minister Roland, in his subsequent address, explained that the goal of the conference is to "realize the economic union of metropolitan France and its colonies," and that "France has no intention of isolating itself economically from the world." He also stated that the development of economic activities in the colonies to improve the lives of the indigenous people and to ensure that foreigners purchase a considerable amount of products from French colonies is of great importance.

The hurricane is now approaching northern Luzon, and it is feared that Manila will be directly affected. The Philippine Governor has approved a relief bill passed by the legislature, allocating one million Philippine pesos for relief funds in the areas affected by the typhoon seven weeks ago. At the same time, the American Red Cross has donated US$50,000 for relief efforts. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Australian Storms Cause Two Kinds of Disasters</h3>
<p>Melbourne According to news received here today, following heavy rain and gales in Victoria, floods have ensued. In the most fertile Gippsland region, seventeen people have died, and an additional six thousand people have been left homeless due to flooded or damaged houses. The local authorities are currently transporting food and daily necessities to the disaster area for relief. During the storm, the ship "Koralla" sank in the swift current, and all seventeen people on board are missing, presumed drowned. The town of Kooweerup, originally with a population of two thousand, is now completely evacuated. Six people drowned, and many others were injured by collapsing houses. Trains are now full of refugees heading to safer areas, many of whom are suffering from illness due to shock and exposure. The financial losses are incalculable. Gippsland, washed away by the floods, has become a wasteland. Railway communications in the disaster area have been disrupted, but telephone lines are still functioning. Airplanes have once again become valuable tools for disaster relief, carrying food to the disaster area and dropping it to refugees sheltering in high places. Without airplanes, these people would starve to death. More than a dozen bridges have also been washed away by the floods, making it almost impossible to reach Gippsland by boat. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>England, France, and Germany Engage in New Understanding Movement</h3>
<p>Motivation from the "German Front"</p>
<p>Old Warriors Abandon Grudges and Seek to Join Hands</p>
<p>German Special Envoy Holds Secret Talks with French Foreign Minister</p>
<p>(Berlin) Behind the scenes of Hitler's special envoy Ribbentrop's visits to London and Paris is a grand plan for Germany to pursue a new understanding between England, France, and Germany. The spirit of this activity comes neither from the German Foreign Ministry nor from the National Socialist Party, but from the "German Front Soldiers." This group is organized by German veterans, maintains a permanent organization in Paris, and is in contact with French veterans. Before French veterans leader M. Yvois met German leader Hitler in Berlin in November, talks were conducted by this organization. This movement began this summer, when the organization sent several copies of a speech draft of Hess, a National Socialist Party official close to Hitler, to French veterans. If the original plan had not been changed, Hess would have gone to Paris on December 15, in the capacity of a veteran, not as a diplomat. Recently, Hess and other National Socialist Party leaders have made speeches, emphatically stating that German veterans are prepared to understand their former enemies, and that there is no difficulty for former warriors to understand each other, only politicians cannot reach a compromise.

<p>(London) The British Legion headquarters here knows nothing about General Ribbentrop's discussions with British veterans. General Hamilton declared today that he had not spoken to General Ribbentrop and that he was unaware of any veterans leaders having spoken to the German special envoy. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) In recent days, there have been rapid developments in London and other European capitals regarding the issue of disarmament. Since the British House of Commons debated imperial defense on November 29, with particular emphasis on Germany's rearmament, various countries have been initiating action. The new factor in the overall situation seems to be of a hopeful nature. The most important is the announcement by German Foreign Minister Neurath that the German government is willing to give sympathetic consideration to any proposals for a harmonious Europe. Currently, Germany is taking a "passive resistance" attitude, determined not to rejoin the League of Nations without a formal invitation, but also willing to avoid arguments that could hinder its future hopes. As for the claim that Germany may raise the issue of the return of colonies or the Polish Corridor lost after the European war, this is generally seen as premature, as this cannot be discussed until Germany's demands for equality are resolved. Although Hitler's disarmament envoy Ribbentrop's trip to Paris has aroused much speculation, it is believed that this trip will not lead to direct talks between France and Germany, as France's "let Germany return to the League of Nations first" attitude remains unchanged. At the same time, according to news from Rome, the Saar Commission is about to reach a compromise on preparations for the Saar plebiscite. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The public is very surprised by the stay in Paris of Hitler's disarmament envoy, General Ribbentrop. French Foreign Minister Laval met with Ribbentrop tonight, holding a closed-door secret talk for a long time. This meeting tonight was at the special request of the German ambassador to France. People in Paris were very surprised by this news, as it was believed that Ribbentrop had returned to Berlin. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Hitler's representative Ribbentrop is here on a private visit, hoping to take the opportunity to meet with the Foreign Minister. He asked the German Ambassador to France, Köster, to arrange the meeting. At 5 PM today, Foreign Minister Laval received Ribbentrop, and the conversation lasted for quite some time. However, Ribbentrop was only exploring opinions and was not tasked with negotiations. Ribbentrop did not seem to be carrying any specific proposals. It is generally believed that today's meeting was only a general consideration of various issues raised by the Foreign Minister in his speech to the Chamber of Deputies on Friday, which are directly related to Germany. (Laval's speech on Friday touched on inviting Germany to join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact and the Saar issue.) Ribbentrop's date of return to Berlin is not yet confirmed, but it is possible that he will leave tomorrow. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

He then said, "It is now impossible for foreign troops to enter Berlin as if entering an uninhabited land. Everyone knows this." He also said that soldiers from all countries participating in the war can understand each other. He had met with French General Pétain in the capital of Yugoslavia (Note: The two met at the funeral of Alexander). General Pétain is a soldier, a man of honor, who can respect Germany. "Only by contacting such people can we understand each other," he said. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Germany's Grand Plan Prepares for Bold Experiment</h3>
<p>What Does the So-Called "Work" Refer To?</p>
<p>Internal Military Forces Distrust Each Other</p>
<p>Religious Disputes Temporarily Eased</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech to the public in Stettin, Prussia today, saying that Germany has some tasks for the future, but the time is not yet ripe. He also said that Germany will implement the most courageous experiment ever seen in history, and that any government that wants to create history must have the courage to decide on a grand plan. What Goebbels meant by the "future work" has aroused strong attention throughout the country. Extreme National Socialists often say that after the Saar plebiscite, foreign adventures are one of the outlets for the National Socialist Party to vent its desires, but responsible parties strongly deny this claim. There are other tensions within the country. The Stormtroopers are dissatisfied with the government, and the Blackshirts are also jealous of the superior position of the regular army, and they want to fight for the right to transfer Blackshirt officials to the regular army. At the same time, the Wehrmacht strongly opposes the Blackshirts' possession of sophisticated weapons, and it is said that they have protested to the leader Hitler because of this matter. In addition, there are church disputes in Germany. Opposing pastors believe that the freedom they currently enjoy may not last, and that there may be another major storm in the future. It is expected that after the Saar plebiscite, the government may have serious sanctions against opposing pastors. It is said that Himmler, the head of secret reconnaissance, has copied the names of the opposing pastors. According to Himmler's opinion, if pastors dare to resist, there is reason to arrest them immediately. It is believed that there are stable elements in the Blackshirts who do not advocate drastic action, so Himmler is holding back. Also, Prussian Prime Minister Göring expressed sympathy for the opposing pastors, which is one of the reasons for the temporary easing of religious disputes. However, Goebbels's views on religious issues are very different from Göring's. Goebbels's speech contained the meaning that he does not oppose the detention of opposing pastors. Major Foerster of the Wehrmacht revealed an article in the veterans' organization, criticizing the militarized Blackshirts, and his words were quite blunt, showing a glimpse of the Wehrmacht's disapproval of the universalization of the military. The Major said that the application of militarization to private intellectual and economic life is a dangerous move. The element of national unity does not lie in the universal military training of the people. Non-military personnel are becoming increasingly militarized soldiers, which is causing them great anxiety. Training is certainly unavoidable, but the Wehrmacht pays much attention to the development of personality, focusing on education rather than emphasizing practice. Someone also published an article in the veterans' newspaper, saying that the millions of Germans who always Hitler will the make personality . (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>France and Germany Reach a Compromise on Saar Financial Issues</h3>
<p>Three-Person Committee Drafts Report</p>
<p>Preparing to Submit to the League of Nations for Discussion</p>
<p>Rome Today, France and Germany signed an important agreement containing several issues related to the Saar region. It stipulates that if the Saar plebiscite on January 13 advocates that the area return to Germany, the German government will promise to pay 900 million francs as the price for the Saar mines, and pay for other items and coal 11 million tons. Last year, the Saar mines produced 10 million tons of coal, more than one million tons of iron, and about 1.5 million tons of steel. The committee ordered to negotiate the agreement will submit a report to the League of Nations on December 5. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome The agreement between France and Germany on the Saar was officially signed at 1:15 PM. On the French side, the signatories were Ambassador to Italy Chamberlin, experts Rouef, Duback, and Misted. On the German side, the signatories were Ambassador to Italy Hassell and experts Bergel Vögdt. The agreement assumes that the Saar plebiscite decides to return to Germany, and stipulates that Germany should pay France a total of 900 million francs in debt. In addition, regarding the coal produced in the Völklingen mine in the Saar region, Germany will extract a certain amount of coal price each year and deliver it to France. The coal mine belongs to Germany, while the mine wells belong to France. The agreement does not involve political issues related to the Saar region. The three-person committee will submit recommendations to the League of Nations Council for resolution, including two layers of protection that Saar residents should enjoy after the vote, and the original rights of those participating in social insurance should be protected. The Workers' Committee has already agreed. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) News that French and German experts have signed an agreement on the economic and financial issues of the Saar region in Rome has been received here with great satisfaction, believing that the task of the League of Nations Council will be reduced.

It is generally expected that Committee Chairman Aloisi will meet with French Foreign Minister Laval tomorrow. The extraordinary meeting of the Council is scheduled to begin at 4 PM on the 5th and will immediately discuss the report of the three-person committee. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Southwest Africa Merging with Germany Declaration Opposes</h3>
<p>Mandate System Not Approved by Germany</p>
<p>Arbitrary Changes Not Allowed</p>
<p>(Berlin) The former German colony of Southwest Africa, which was entrusted to the Union of South Africa by the League of Nations after the European War, recently passed a resolution in the colonial parliament with a two-thirds majority, requesting to be merged into the Union of South Africa and become the fifth state of the Union. German newspapers were extremely angry upon hearing this news. Recently, Dr. Schnee (former member of the Lytton Commission), chairman of the German Colonial Society, issued a declaration stating, "The mandate system is a system stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. Since Germany is a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, the mandate system cannot be changed without Germany's approval." Schnee said that Germany should resolutely oppose anyone seeking to merge Germany's former colonies in Africa and other colonies that are currently under mandate. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<p>Before French-German Negotiations are Clear</p>
<p>Unwilling to Make Decisions Lightly</p>
<p>Warsaw Polish public opinion believes that France and Germany are conducting negotiations regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Before the results of these negotiations are clear, especially before the Saar plebiscite is held, Poland should not make any decisions. Two extreme newspapers representing the government expressed this view, one being the conservative "Times" and the other being the radical "Berassi."

<h3>Romanian-Russian Diplomatic Relations Restored</h3>
<p>Russian New Envoy Presents Credentials</p>

<h3>Kirov's Assassination Deals a Heavy Blow to Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>The Assassin is Under Interrogation</p>
<p>(Moscow) The assassin of Central Executive Committee member Kirov is named Nikolaev, aged thirty, and was formerly employed by the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Bureau. The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a public statement saying that after interrogating the assassin all day Sunday, they learned his name, age, and previous occupation. The case is still in the preliminary stages of investigation. Kirov was a key figure in Soviet Russia, a right-hand man to Stalin. The entire country mourns his death. All streets in Moscow are flying red flags with black borders. Newspapers devoted their entire front pages to the assassination news, denouncing the "Worker's Gazette" or fascist terrorists. It is reported that Kirov was assassinated at 4:30 PM on Saturday at the Smolny Institute, the Soviet office in Leningrad. The assassin, Nikolaev, suddenly rushed into Kirov's office, took out a pistol, and shot Kirov, who was at his desk, at close range. The assassin was captured on the spot. All that is known about the assassination is this. Since Lenin was wounded in an assassination attempt in 1918, Kirov is the first Soviet leader to be assassinated. Officials say that Kirov was a revolutionary figure who was fierce, straightforward, and fearless. His assassination is the most significant blow Soviet Russia has suffered in recent years. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Leningrad Kirov's coffin is temporarily placed in the Uritzky Palace for public viewing. Representatives from various factories, collectives and state-owned farms, and institutions stand guard beside the coffin. All theaters here have suspended performances to express mourning. In the evening, residents of this city went to pay their respects. As factory whistles blew at the end of the work day, workers lined up outside the gates of each factory, waiting to proceed. Thereupon, large numbers of workers, Red Army soldiers, scientists, students, writers, artists, and government officials advanced towards the Uritzky Palace. They carried torches, portraits of Kirov, and mourning flags. The coffin was surrounded by flags and flowers. Friends of the deceased took turns standing guard. Those paying their respects shed tears. The Leningrad Academy of Sciences held a grand memorial service. Researchers and members of famous scientific societies all attended. Deputy Dean Komarov gave a speech, calling Kirov a friend of science. Researcher Yue Fei recalled the first time he met Kirov, saying that he was able to give everyone an unforgettable impression with his profound and clear thinking. The memorial service resolved to express deep mourning for this great loss, and stated that those attending this meeting will never forget the support Kirov provided for scientific work. (TASS dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, all newspapers published special memorial editions, containing memoirs and condolences. The Zhenwang newspaper editorial stated, "One of our country's most outstanding sons, a student of Lenin and Stalin, and a famous leader of our party, Kirov, has been murdered by an assassin sent by the enemies of the working class. The dirty hands of the enemy have cut the golden thread on the tapestry of the revolution. The enemy still wants to infiltrate the revolutionary camp to stop our progress through assassination. However, the revolution is eternal and invincible. Although the frontline commander has fallen, Commander-in-Chief Lenin remains unharmed. Although a sentinel has been assassinated, our great army fighting to build socialism remains unharmed." The Izvestia newspaper stated, "Kirov died from the enemy's bullets. Millions of laborers are outraged by the news of Kirov's death. Although the counter-revolutionary dogs who assassinated Kirov have inflicted a heavy blow on us, their expectations will not be realized. Gentlemen, you are mistaken. There have been many lackeys of capitalists in our revolutionary history, (from generals carrying bombs to feeble-minded socialist revolutionaries,) who have tried to incite Bolshevik disputes through white terror. They did not succeed even when the White Army approached Moscow and Petrograd. The Bolshevik steel front advanced resolutely, faced difficult circumstances, and ultimately was invincible. Today, our country's economy has developed greatly, and culture has also progressed. The masses have gathered around the Party. At this time, the enemy's madness and assassination can only lead to their own early destruction. Kirov was indeed the pride of our Party, and our Party's unity and its firm belief in victory have never been as strong as they are today." (TASS dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Leningrad Kirov's body, which was suddenly attacked yesterday, is today housed in the Poteemkin Palace. Prince Poteemkin was a famous confidant of Empress Catherine the Great in history. From dusk to midnight, workers wearing flowers and flags lined up to pay their respects to the coffin, which was illuminated by electric lights. The band played mourning music. The body will probably be moved to Moscow on Wednesday and will be kept for one day before being buried in the Kremlin Palace Garden. The police are now investigating whether the assassin had accomplices or whether it was a conspiracy by an anti-government organization. It is now known that the assassin forged documents and infiltrated the Leningrad Soviet headquarters at 4:30 PM yesterday, firing a shot that hit Kirov in the chest. Kirov died within two hours. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assassin shot himself in the chest with the gun, but his injuries were not serious. Kirov was 41 years old. Some believe that Kirov was Stalin's successor.

<h3>Importers of Foreign Wheat Request Relief from Taxation</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Reiterates Ban to Prevent Smuggling of Silver</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that although the trend of silver exports has slowed slightly, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no smugglers.

<p>(Nanjing) At the Ministry of Finance's memorial week meeting on the morning of the 3rd, a section chief from the Monetary Affairs Department reported on the process of levying silver export tax, roughly stating that in the 20th year of the Republic, various countries abandoned the gold standard, causing silver prices to soar, but the impact on our country was limited at this time. After the United States announced the nationalization of silver, as of October, silver outflows reached 200 million yuan. Although national wealth is based on national purchasing power, it is not surprising that some flows out, but our country is a silver standard country, and silver currency is a market bargaining chip, and it should also prevent outflows and maintain a balanced state. In order to implement fundamental measures, the Ministry of Finance levied silver export tax balancing tax, and also established a market stabilization exchange, handled exchange, and ordered customs to strictly prevent private smuggling. Since the implementation of tax collection, silver outflows have been greatly reduced, the market is stable, and people's minds are at ease. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Change of Customs Commissioner at Tianjin Customs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance recently announced the appointment of Hirokichi Anamoto as the Customs Commissioner of Tianjin Customs, while the current incumbent, Mr. Burs, will be transferred to the post of Customs Commissioner of Hankou Customs. Anamoto previously served as the Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Section of the Directorate General of Customs, and then requested leave to return to his country due to personal matters. He recently returned to China after taking leave and intended to return to his original position at the Directorate General of Customs. The Ministry of Finance authorities considered that the current Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Section of the Directorate General of Customs, Ding Guitang, was effective in his work and it was inconvenient to make a sudden transfer, so Anamoto was appointed to the important post of Tianjin Customs. It is understood that Ding is the most senior Chinese official in the customs service, having served for more than 20 years and is extremely capable. When the Director General of Customs, Mr. Mallard, requested leave to return to his country, the Ministry of Finance ordered him to act as the head of the General Affairs Section. Recently, he was officially appointed. It is also heard that the government intends, in the midst of the recovery of customs autonomy, that the post of General Affairs Section will no longer be filled by foreigners.

<h3>Battle Records of Recovering Qingliu</h3>
<p>The bandits of Ninghua are also under encirclement.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In Fujian Province, only Qingliu and Ninghua counties in northern Fujian remain bandit areas. Wei Lihuang, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Army, after recapturing Changting, immediately ordered Lu Xingrong's troops to advance towards Mingxi and Qingliu counties. After receiving the order, Lu's troops advanced towards Qingliu in separate groups. On November 20th, they first recaptured Mingxi, engaged in searching for scattered bandits, and actively advanced towards Qingliu. On the 26th at noon, they reached the vicinity of the county town. There were about a thousand bandits entrenched in the city and the suburbs, who stubbornly resisted relying on the terrain. Several hundred more bandits also came from Xiake to attack Lu's troops from the rear. The brigade fought back in separate groups, first defeating the bandits from the outskirts and Xiake, and then besieged the city. The 311th Regiment crossed the river and charged into the city. After fighting until Shen Shi (3-5 PM), the city was recovered. It is estimated that over forty people were killed, including the pseudo-Min-Gan guerrilla commander Chen Yezhen, political commissar Lin Shengyou, chief of staff Wang Fachun, and soldiers. Fifty-odd guns were seized, over ninety bandit officers and soldiers were captured, and countless banners, publications, grain, and public cattle were seized. Over sixty male and female hostages from Yong'an and Mingxi were rescued. Over twenty bandits drowned while fleeing by jumping into the river. The remaining forces fled towards the southeast. It was found that Qingliu had been occupied by bandits for three years, the people were displaced, the fields were barren, the houses were destroyed, and the local area was extremely devastated. The streets were extremely filthy. There were less than three hundred old and young people in the entire city. Currently, Commander Lu is recruiting refugees on one hand and searching for scattered bandits on the other. Yesterday, the provincial government received another telegram from Lu Xingrong. According to reconnaissance reports, there are over a thousand bandits with eight or nine hundred guns in the Wucunquan area, seven or eight hundred bandits with four or five hundred guns in the Luofang Hekou area, and five or six hundred bandits with two or three hundred guns in the Xiake Gongfang area. Within Ninghua city, there are only over four hundred remaining bandits with over three hundred guns, but they are all starving and exhausted. As soon as the scattered bandits in the neighboring areas are cleared, they can advance towards Ninghua. The provincial government has ordered Tang Yintang, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Third District, to transport salt and rice from Yanping and Yong'an to provide relief. As for the bandits in Ninghua, they are now surrounded on three sides by various units, unable to resist, and will be annihilated soon. Therefore, the complete recovery of the bandit areas in Fujian Province is just around the corner. (November 11th)</p>

<h3>Northwest Inspection Notes Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</h3>
<p>The "Dry Boats" of Northwest Transportation</p>
<p>I woke up on the morning of the 9th feeling quite cold. Yesterday, when digging a sand well, thick ice had formed. The camel drivers removed the ice and shouted "Camel! Camel! Camel!" The camels, grazing in the distance, immediately raised their heads and came to stand beside the well (actually a long ditch), drinking with "boo boo" sounds. They drank a lot, so even if there was no water for three or four days, they could travel far without drinking. We set off at noon. The mountains were far away and the land was barren, with sparse grass. Only aged alkali flats were occasionally seen. After thirty li, we stopped at Daquan to release the camels and wait for the escort soldiers. The spring water gushed out of the cliff, flowing leisurely westward and forming a pond that could irrigate fields. There used to be over twenty families living there, but now they have all fled, leaving the cultivated land, large and small, forty-odd fields in total, and the uncultivated wilderness, as far as the eye can see, all abandoned, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>The next morning was the Double Tenth Festival (National Day of the Republic of China). The postman was still riding and delivering mailbags, and the camel drivers were still releasing camels and looking for firewood, as if they were unaware that today was the auspicious day of the birth of the Republic of China. Because I was waiting to meet the escort soldiers, I decided to stay here for a day. Although it was like enjoying a day of leisure on a holiday, I still felt somewhat unsatisfied because I did not get to see the national flag waving in the wind or hear the speeches of important people commemorating the festival. I happened to see a camel driver tying the camel's foot with a rope and using an awl to pierce the palm and sew a piece of leather on top. I couldn't help but be interested in studying camels again, so I continued to describe what I had not found in my previous notes about camels. The camel's palm is originally soft flesh. If it is worn out by sand and stones, it will be difficult to walk. Therefore, leather pieces are used to repair the damaged areas. When they heal, the patches fall off naturally. If traveling on coarse sand or Gobi desert, to prevent the camel's palm from being worn out, one cannot nail iron horseshoes like mules and horses, but some people also wrap their feet with leather, as if wearing shoes. If encountering a ditch that is neither narrow nor shallow, the camel finds it difficult to jump over, and it cannot step deeply into the ditch. At this time, the camel drivers even lie down in the ditch to cushion the camel's steps, which can ensure that it is not injured. When encountering a checkpoint at night and wanting to avoid taxes, one only needs to stop the bell, and the tax bureau will not hear it. This is because the camel's palm is soft and its steps are light. However, it is far inferior to the inherent ability of mules and horses to climb high and cross thresholds.</p>
<p>Camels are docile, strong, but timid, and are higher animals of the cold zone. They are suitable for traveling in deserts, carrying heavy loads over long distances, and can go without food or drink for four or five days. They are known as "dry boats" and "dry dragons." They are about seven or eight feet tall, and their length from head to tail is over ten feet. The humps are divided into double and single. Double-humped camels are the most numerous and are more docile, making them especially suitable for carrying goods. Single-humped camels are less numerous and are fierce and good at running, making them suitable for riding. In the deserts of southern Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia, single-humped wild camels are sometimes discovered, but they are difficult to tame and can only be hunted for food. Castrated camels are the most expensive, costing about fifty or sixty yuan each. Male and female camels are next, and only two or three male camels are left in each herd. Every time it is the mating season at the end of winter, the female camels salivate from their mouths, which is commonly called "tide." Only after the tide do the female camels lie down and mate with the male camels, which is called "laying down." After becoming pregnant, the female camels avoid the male camels as soon as they see them and do not lie down. The gestation period is after the following year, and some even gestate for fifteen months. On average, they can give birth to two offspring every three years, hence the saying "see each other twice in three years." If they give birth midway, the camel calves are loaded onto the backs of the mother camels, and the mother camels can still run together.</p>
<p>One year after the camel calves grow, the males are castrated, which are castrated camels. After three or four years, they can carry heavy loads. They are good for raising and can live for thirty years. However, the nose must be pierced first to facilitate pulling. The wooden stick used to pierce the nose is about four inches long and as thick as a little finger. One end is as large as an onion, or a wooden fork, and the other end is sharp. It pierces through the nasal skin from right to left. The pierced area is hollow inside, and the outside is only separated by a layer of skin and flesh, piercing through, and there are those who do not bleed. This is a natural formation. The camel rein is tied to the sharp end of the pierced wood. Pulling it hard causes it to cry out in pain. When walking, they are connected one after another, forming a line. If the rein breaks and falls to the ground, they stop. If the end of the rein is buried in a pile of soil, they dare not move. Pulling the rein and hitting the ground causes them to kneel. If two camels tie their reins to each other, they will do a "spiral dance" endlessly. The way the camel camp is arranged for the night is also based on the reins to conform. The camel I ride hates dogs walking beside it. When it sees a dog, it will kick it hard. If the dog is a little far away, before kicking it, it will lightly stomp a few steps to prevent the dog from escaping. Also, the Dunhuang Chronicle records that when a black storm is about to rise, old camels know in advance and always make a long cry. The remaining camels bury their lips in the sand. When people see their appearance, they also quickly plan to avoid the wind. Before long, the black storm arrives. Camels are huge creatures and possess intelligence, but it is unexpected that they are tied with thin reins and are forever subdued by accumulated power, daring not to easily break free, which is also pitiful.</p>
<p>The camel saddle is woven from wool thread, as thick as a sack, and filled with weeds to make a rectangular shape. Each camel needs two pieces, and two more pieces of wood are used to clamp the left and right sides of the camel hump. The goods are then carefully loaded on top. They can carry over three hundred pieces for long distances and four or five hundred catties for short distances. Normally, they travel seventy or eighty li per day, and ride camels can travel four or five hundred li. The annual camel transport period is about seven or eight months. During April and May, they are released into the wild and allowed to eat and rest, which is called "releasing the fields" or "striking the fields." The "releasing the fields" in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan often selects pastures hundreds of li away, so that they can eat and rest as much as possible and shed and replace new hair. By August and September, they are driven back for use, which is called "rising the fields." At this time, they are plump and strong, and there is no need for fodder. Until the end of the year, when the grass is withered and the meat is thin, steamed bean cakes are used, sprinkled with water and kneaded, and put in bags to hang on the camel's head. They kneel down and eat, making it convenient to load and unload. When camels lie down, they first kneel on their front legs and then bend their hind legs, and vice versa when getting up. It is commonly said that camels occupy twelve appearances: rat's teeth, cow's hooves, tiger's chest, rabbit's mouth, dragon's neck, snake's eyes, horse's ears, sheep's nose, monkey's hair, chicken's feet, dog's scrotum, pig's tail, etc. It is also said, "The head resembles a Hu sheep, the neck resembles a goose, it is neither a donkey nor a horse, nor is it a mule." Upon close observation, it is indeed correct. Camel drivers lead camels, each in order, with each person leading ten or so camels, each connected by reins, proceeding in a line. The person leading the first camel is called the "head camel," and its movements are according to their will. The last camel has a large bell hanging around its neck, ringing "ding ding dang dang," which is called the "bell ringer." If it falls off, the camel behind it stops, and the bell is silent, so people notice and return to tie it. Camels are afraid of the heat and must be released to graze, so the daily journey is mostly in the afternoon and at night. Every time they arrive at a station, they first unload the goods and then set up tents, chop firewood, cook rice, and stand watch. In Chahar and Suiyuan, they are mostly designated, while in Gansu and Xinjiang, they are mostly rotated. Each driver receives a monthly salary of about six yuan in Chahar and Suiyuan, and only two yuan in Gansu and Xinjiang. The food is rough, the work is heavy, and the treatment is harsh, which urgently needs to be improved.</p>
<p>In various parts of northwestern China, transportation is mostly underdeveloped, and in the vast wilderness deserts, it still relies on camel transport. According to reports from Nanjing, the total number of camels in the country is 2,637 in Outer Mongolia, 80,000 in the four provinces of Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Rehe, 58,000 in Heilongjiang, 50,000 in Xinjiang, 50,000 in Qinghai, and 20,000 in Shaanxi and Gansu, totaling 260,637. It can be said that camels still occupy an important position in the transportation of the Northwest.</p>
<h3>Appeal from the Silk Weaving Industry in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>=Silk prices have fallen and many silk businesses have been suspended=</p>
<p>=One-third of the mulberry trees in Linqu have been uprooted=</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The silk industry has always been prosperous in the Linqu Zhoucun area of Shandong Province. Linqu County alone used to sell more than 4 million yuan worth of silk in the 17th year of the Republic (1928). The silk weaving industry in Zhoucun was also developed in the past. All its products, silk fabrics, were known as Dong goods, also known as Zhoucun goods. Although they are not as beautiful as those produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they are more durable, which greatly benefits rural areas and promotes industry and commerce. In recent years, due to the sharp drop in silk prices, the impact has been significant. The Zhoucun Silk Weaving Industry Association, Dyeing Industry Association, and Silk Merchants, considering their livelihoods, jointly sent a letter to the Shandong Min Guomin Daily, requesting the Construction Department to promote domestic silk in order to prevent foreign goods, save the industry, and relieve rural areas. The original letter is as follows: "We believe that the land of Qi and Lu has long been known as a region of mulberry and hemp, with the silk industry accounting for half of it. Since the founding of the Republic, the government has repeatedly promoted it, and mulberry trees have covered almost all the fields of eastern Shandong. In recent years, raw silk has been in a slump, and many merchants have gone bankrupt. A visitor from Linqu said that one-third of the mulberry trees in his county have been uprooted to bake tobacco leaves, claiming that if the cocoon price remains the same, they will be completely removed. The efforts of promoting mulberry planting for years would be in vain, which is a great pity. According to the investigation, one-third of the silk businesses in Zhoucun have been suspended, and nearly 10,000 workers have lost their jobs. The remaining capable ones have also switched to weaving foreign hemp. Tens of thousands of workers are working hard day and night to promote foreign hemp, which is hateful. At present, the price of silk has fallen by eight-tenths compared to the past, which is unprecedentedly low. A foot of plain twill iron machine silk, weighing one tael, costs no more than two jiao. Silk gauze costs one tael and one jiao, including the labor cost. The price is the same as cloth, but it is twice as strong and durable. If the directors of the various departments can uphold the spirit of helping the people and purchase some pieces, sell them in various counties, and persuade people to love the country, so that civil servants, gentry, merchants, and scholars who wear Zhongshan uniforms can use domestic goods, and since the material is good and the price is the same as cloth, everyone will surely be happy to follow. The virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, and the superiors act as an example, and the inferiors will certainly follow. If the industry can thrive as a result, and the flood of foreign hemp can be stopped, there will be good results, and the people will benefit greatly, not just the farmers, workers, and merchants," etc.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Kidnapping and Murder Case</h3>
<p>The Kidnapped Victim Was a Section Member of the督配局 (Supervision and Allocation Bureau)</p>
<p>Lured and Imprisoned in a House Under the Pretense of Selling It</p>
<p>The Kidnapped Victim Was Killed and Two Kidnappers Were Arrested</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, a major kidnapping case occurred in this city, causing a sensation in society. The victim's family kept it a secret at the beginning of the case. It was not until the end of March, when the case was solved and the victim was murdered, that the outside world learned the truth. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Disappearance: Zhong Dejie, a native of Fangcheng County, residing on the third floor of No. 12 Huiji West Road, Guangzhou City, was a section member of the Guangdong Provincial River督配稽查 General Bureau. Because he was the younger brother of Bureau Chief Zheng of the督配稽查 Bureau and his family was wealthy and extravagant, he attracted the attention of bandits. A month ago, Zhong had told his friends that he planned to spend a large sum of money to buy a building, and several friends had introduced him to houses for sale. On the 2nd of this month, Zhong returned home after finishing his work, and a friend invited him out to inspect a house for sale. Unexpectedly, he disappeared without a trace, like a yellow crane. His family posted notices to find him, but there was no news for several days.</p>
<p>Ransom: A few days later, the Zhong residence suddenly received a letter from the bandits, stating that Zhong Dejie was being held captive and demanding that they quickly raise 100,000 yuan and hand it over to a designated location to secure his release, otherwise his life would be in danger. The letter was signed with a certain bandit gang's name. Only then did the Zhong family realize that Zhong had been kidnapped by bandits. They immediately sent someone to negotiate the ransom with the bandits and reported the matter to the authorities, requesting them to arrest the bandits. Zhong's relatives were all powerful and influential, so detectives were dispatched everywhere, and the investigation was extremely strict. The bandits, knowing that the situation was urgent, sent a second letter, urging the victim's family to quickly prepare the ransom. The Zhong family did not respond. The bandits then put Zhong to death. At the beginning of this month, a third letter came, asking the Zhong family to send someone to the Changdi Zhongshan Hotel to negotiate.</p>
<p>Arrest: Police detectives and representatives of the Zhong family went to the Zhongshan Noodle Shop as agreed. At 7:00 PM on the 23rd, the representative suddenly received a phone call, ordering them to bring the ransom to redeem the victim the next day, otherwise the kidnapped person would have no hope of survival. At this time, the caller's voice was identified by the police detectives. They immediately tracked the phone call to its origin, and found that it came from a Western restaurant on Changdi. The detectives immediately went there and found that the caller was still sitting there, dining with a female companion. The detectives stepped forward and asked for his name. The guest scolded them, saying that they were being abrupt. The detectives recognized that his voice was the same as the bandit who had called the Zhongshan Hotel. They immediately tied him up. The guest initially tried to quibble, but was later taken to the Public Security Bureau's Detective Section for investigation. After much questioning, the bandit confessed the mastermind of the case. The main culprit was then arrested immediately.</p>
<p>Confession: According to the main culprit's confession, he and six others lured Zhong Dejie on the 2nd. First, a close friend of Zhong falsely claimed that there was a mansion at No. 14 Ren'an Street, Xiaobeimen, and urged him to go and see it. When Zhong arrived, they immediately detained him, intending to demand a ransom of 100,000 yuan. Later, Zhong's family deliberately delayed, and reported the matter to the authorities for investigation. The accomplices, seeing police everywhere, feared that once the matter was revealed, they would not be spared. If they released Zhong without conditions, it would be even more difficult to gain a foothold afterward. Therefore, on the night of the 6th of this month, they strangled Zhong to death with a rope and buried his body in the basement of the house, in order to cover up their tracks.</p>
<p>Discovery of the Body: After hearing the confession, the police detectives immediately dispatched officers to escort the criminals to No. 14 Ren'an Street, Xiaobeimen, as guides. When they arrived, they found that the people in the house had already moved out, and a "For Sale" sign was posted on the door. Inside the door were two or three construction workers, repairing the walls. The police detectives pushed open the door and ordered the criminals to point out where the body was hidden. The workers dug in the basement of the left room of the house. At a depth of about two feet, a foul smell filled the air. Another foot deeper, Zhong's body was completely exposed, but most of it had already decomposed. Later, the court's coroner also arrived at the scene to examine the body and found three rope marks on the deceased's neck. The deceased's clothes still had the督配局 badge. It was confirmed that he had been strangled to death. After completing the coroner's report, the deceased's family took the body back for burial the next day. The truth of the case was thus revealed. However, the authorities said that of the six criminals, only two have been arrested. The other four are still at large. They are now intensifying their efforts to track down the escaped bandits so that they can be tried together with those in custody. (November 28th)</p>
<p>Jiang Song: Hunan Refugees Causing Disturbances in the Countryside</p>
<p>The county government recently received an urgent telegram from Shihudang Township, reporting that nearly one hundred people claiming to be refugees from Hunan were gathering crowds and causing disturbances in the Zhangzhuang area, taking the opportunity to loot and pillage, and could not be stopped. They requested that a team be dispatched to suppress them. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Jin immediately dispatched the Security Brigade's Water Patrol Team to the countryside to suppress the disturbances and reassure the local residents.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Committee Member Visits Songjiang for Inspection</p>
<p>Ye Xiufeng, a member of the Provincial Government and Standing Committee member of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee, came to Songjiang today by private car to inspect the county government and the Anti-Smoking Committee. It is said that he instructed the director of the committee to strictly investigate and punish those who smoke without a license and those who set up private smoking dens. Once a case is discovered, they should be severely punished according to the law. He returned to Shanghai that evening.</p>
<p>Kunshan: Bandits Loot Two Villages</p>
<p>Last night, a large number of bandits, forty or fifty in number, suddenly arrived at the second village of Manzihang Ge Cemetery in the Sixth District. They spoke in mixed accents and were all armed with guns. After arriving, they looted all the residents of the two villages. They did not leave with their loot until dawn today, heading towards Dianshan Lake. It is said that the two villages suffered heavy losses. The district chief, Dai, is now going to investigate in order to report to the county government for strict investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Editor of New Kunshan Daily Detained</p>
<p>Wu Xingbo, the director of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, sent detectives to the New Kunshan Daily yesterday afternoon to arrest the editor, Feng Yi, and put him in custody. For a time, there was much discussion in society. After inquiring in many ways, reporters learned that the reason for the detention was leaking military secrets (the county security team was stationed in various townships). Another said that on the evening of the 27th of last month, when sixteen policemen from the Public Security Bureau went to Lu Wenhuan's house in Chejiabang, outside the Daxi Gate, to arrest gamblers, they were resisted. A policeman, Liu Tianwu, fell into the river and drowned. The next day, Feng wrote an article about it, implying that the police were arresting gamblers and even suffered drowning. Another said that Feng had recently tried to extort money from a butcher shop without success, which led to the accusation. It is not known which is true, so it is recorded here to await verification.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Rice and Paddy Rice Are Crowded and Sales Are Stagnant</p>
<p>The sales of rice in this county's market have recently tended to be stagnant. On the supply side, a large amount of foreign rice from Shanghai has arrived. There are about six or seven hundred boats of indica rice and paddy rice from southern Anhui coming to Wuxi. However, domestic sales are quite sluggish, so prices, even if they do not fall sharply, will inevitably have a slight decline. It is difficult to predict the rise and fall of market prices next year. According to yesterday's market opening, new white japonica rice was 12 yuan to 11.4 yuan, white yuan rice was 13.3 yuan, Jiangbei white yuan rice was 11.45 yuan, white passenger indica rice was 10 yuan to 11 yuan, Du Yuan wheat was 5.7-8 yuan, Du yellow beans were 6.5-6 yuan, and Saigon rice was 11.1-2 yuan.</p>
<p>Baojia Bridge Robbery Case: Victim Wounded by Knife</p>
<p>Hua Renfa, a resident of Baojia Bridge near Dongting in the second district of the county, is a farmer by trade and has a small amount of land, which led to him being coveted by bandits. At about 10:00 PM the night before last, thirteen or fourteen bandits suddenly came, speaking in a strong northern accent and carrying刺刀 (bayonets) and watermelon knives. They opened the back door and entered the house, pulling Hua's wife, Tang, out of her warm bed. They forced her to reveal where the silver was hidden, injuring her arms and flanks. They also stole clothes, jewelry, silver dollars, and other items. At the time, the victim, Hua Renfa, was in the middle of making rice and rushed out of the house to a neighbor's house, ringing the gong to raise the alarm. The bandits then left with their loot, leaving behind a兇刀 (murder weapon). The incident has been reported by the camp to the County Public Security Bureau, which has ordered strict investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Director Yin Inspects the Zhencheng Road</p>
<p>The paving of the Zhencheng Road is gradually being completed. The sections between Wuben and Longhutang and Zhenjiang have been opened to traffic one after another. Shen Qi, the director of the Provincial Highway Administration Office, set off from Tianzhen on the 2nd in a single-seater car to inspect the road surface along the way. He arrived in Cheng at 2:00 PM and returned to Zhenjiang in the same car. The full road opening ceremony will be held on New Year's Day next year. According to Director Shen, the road surface construction along the way is good. The operation of long-distance buses is currently being tendered for.</p>
<p>Nantong: Coastal Areas Defend Against Bandit Raids</p>
<p>The nine coastal areas of Nantong have suffered from repeated raids by sea bandits. Although the bandit ships have been repelled by the teams, it is difficult for the police teams to stay for a long time. Currently, the local militia are following the defense measures set by the Nantong District Security Headquarters, building bunkers at key locations at the sea entrance, and having the fishing teams guard them day and night to prevent bandit ships from invading.</p>
<p>Haimen: County and City Bus Station Fire</p>
<p>Xu Shaolong's house at the county and city bus station caught fire at about 1:00 PM yesterday (the 1st) due to carelessness while cooking lunch. Suddenly, thick smoke billowed and flames soared, alarming the entire city. The fire brigade and the Public Security Bureau chief and police rushed to the rescue. It took more than an hour to gradually extinguish the fire. It is estimated that six houses and miscellaneous items were burned down, worth more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Verdict on Corpse Money Sharing Case</p>
<p>In March of this year, a floating corpse was found at Yujiaogang in the first district, with more than 1,000 yuan in banknotes in its clothes. It was found by villagers Wang Shihua and Zhu Xianglang, who intended to embezzle it. Later, it was learned by local gangsters Xuan Changhai and Yang Sili, who detained Wang and Zhu in a room, threatened them in every way, and ordered them to hand over the original money and share it. Later, the township chief Liu Hui reported the matter to the county government, which ordered the police to arrest Wang and Zhu. Shi and Yang were on the run. During the interrogation, Wang and Zhu both confessed. The sentence was announced the other day: Wang Shihua and Zhu Xianglang were sentenced to two months in prison. Shi Changhai and Yang Sili were on the run and have not been caught. They are being wanted.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Fengqiao Maoshengfeng Pawnshop Suspends Business</p>
<p>Since the three money shops and one bank in Jiaxing declared liquidation, the Zhongjie Da錩pawnshop, Wangdian Renxin pawnshop, and Puyuan Gongyi pawnshop have all been affected and have declared suspension of pawn and waiting for purchase. As a result, poor farmers have no way to pawn their goods. Currently, the local people have submitted a petition to the Construction Department, requesting that it order the pawnshops to resume business so that the poor can have access to funds. Unexpectedly, the Maoshengfeng pawnshop in Fengqiao Township, a county affiliate, also used the excuse of being affected by rural bankruptcy and having accumulated goods, and announced the suspension of pawn and waiting for purchase yesterday. The farmers there will again experience the pain of not being able to pawn their goods.</p>
<p>Opening of County Councilor Election Ballots</p>
<p>The Jiaxing County Councilor election was held on the 2nd at the township offices. At 5:00 PM, the ballot boxes were sent to the district offices, and the ballots were opened in the district offices starting on the 3rd. However, in this election, those who hoped to be elected made efforts in many ways, and the material losses were countless. There were also several ballot boxes that were not sealed by the supervisors, so there were many rumors among social figures. It is also known that citizens such as Shen have telegraphed the provincial government to control the dispersal and to re-elect the government.</p>
<p>Huzhou: Bandit Li Xiangfang Executed by Shooting</p>
<p>Li Xiangfang (also known as Li Changshou), a bandit who had repeatedly committed kidnapping and robbery, was arrested by Huang Yuqing, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Wuxing County Public Security Bureau, in a grass shed in Donglin Mountain in July. After County Magistrate Dai interrogated him, Li confessed to the kidnapping and robbery without hesitation and was sentenced to death. The sentence was submitted to the province for approval.

Shanghai South Station is scheduled to implement it tomorrow morning. A preliminary rehearsal was held this morning, from 3:00 AM to dawn. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preliminary Rehearsal This Morning: Shanghai South Station held a preliminary air defense rehearsal this morning. Zhong Wenjiang, the head of the Shanghai-Jiading section of the Transportation Department, served as the general commander. Han Shangying, the head of the Shanghai-Jiading section of the Police Department, served as the deputy commander and managed the police sentries.

<p>Issuing General Mobilization Order: At 3:00 AM this morning, a report came from the Longhua Road telephone that five or six enemy planes had taken off from Jiaxing and were attacking Shanghai South Station. After receiving the call, the South Station master, Zhong Wenjiang, issued an order to prepare for defense, and all the lights along the line and inside the station were turned off. All the staff of the Railway Bureau immediately set out in accordance with their assigned duties, and a general mobilization for prevention was launched. All the railway police immediately patrolled the road, announcing a special curfew. Anyone passing by must be inspected.</p>
<p>Enemy Air Raid: The South Station telegraph operator immediately sent a telegram to each station to report the enemy planes' movements and the places they passed. When the enemy planes arrived, they used lime bags as bombs to bomb the bridges, tracks, and stations along the way. The houses along the line had caught fire. The station immediately dispatched people to put out the fire, rescue the injured, and send craftsmen to rush to repair the bridges and tracks. At the same time, the families of railway personnel and residents along the line were taken in, and the station's freight yard was designated as a shelter. After the enemy planes left, traffic and lights were restored.</p>

After the major stations on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway have completely held the exercises, the grades will be assessed and rewarded separately based on the results of each station.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Instructs Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Other Groups to Prevent Smuggling of Silver Goods</h3>
<p>They Must Provide Sincere Assistance</p>
<p>Notify All Merchants to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Trade Association yesterday, saying: "The purpose of the Ministry's collection of silver export tax and balance tax is to preserve wealth and stabilize the market. The impact of this concerns the well-being of the whole country. However, recently, some unscrupulous merchants have only sought private gain and disregarded the overall situation, and have often smuggled silver goods for export. This illegal profiteering is extremely hateful. The Ministry has already strictly ordered the customs to carefully investigate and arrest these merchants. However, the aforementioned smuggling is complex and varied, and the official's eyes and ears may not be comprehensive. In particular, all legal organizations should turn to joint supervision. If smuggling of silver goods for export or instigation of smuggling is discovered, it should be reported to the nearby customs office immediately. In areas without customs offices, the local government should be secretly reported to detain the goods first, and then submit them to the Ministry for verification. All the goods will be confiscated, and the amount of smuggled silver will be doubled as a penalty. If a merchant reports the situation and leads to the seizure, 40% of the fine will be used as a bonus to encourage them. The name of the original informant will be kept confidential by the ministry. All legal organizations have close financial relations and must provide sincere assistance in order to achieve the effect of mutual support. In addition to issuing separate orders, all merchants are hereby ordered to comply with the above, and so on."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Does Not Allow Conscription</h3>
<p>Transportation Office Soldiers and Soldiers Are Punished</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that on November 9th, Zhang Mingyue from Shaoxing came to Shanghai from his hometown to look for work. He was passing by the outer Ma Road of the 16th Pier and was lured by Zhou Jinbiao, a transporter from the Zhedong Office of the Fourth Recruitment Office stationed in Shanghai, to the Nanhuiguan and forced to join the army. After his brother, Zhang Zhongjian, learned about it, he reported it to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and requested rescue. The headquarters sent personnel to investigate and found that Zhang Mingyue had been assigned to the Engineering Company of the 36th Division by the Transit Office. The headquarters ordered the New Soldier Transit Office to quickly bring Zhang Mingyue back to the headquarters for verification. Afterwards, Zhang Mingyue was released from the Engineering Company and reported the details of the abduction to the headquarters. As Shanghai does not allow conscription, it has already been ordered to be implemented. A letter was also sent to the Zhedong Office of the Fourth Recruitment Office to investigate. It has now been heard that the transporter Zhou Jinbiao has been dismissed and punished. Li Ren, the adjutant of the Transit Office, was given a demerit for not paying attention to the counting of new soldiers. An strict order was given to all transportation personnel not to have this type of situation occur again when sending soldiers to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Suffering of the People in the Southeast and East of Xiaoshan Due to Disasters</h3>
<h3>Mr. Yu Jichuan Discusses Hunan Province Issuing 10 Million Yuan in Public Bonds</h3>
<p>=Two-Thirds for Road Construction, Remainder for Old Debts=</p>
<p>=Approved by the Executive Yuan, Issuance Imminent=</p>
<p>=Initial Loan of 250,000 to Complete the Hunan-Guangxi Trunk Line=</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Yu Jichuan, a member of the Hunan Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Department of Construction, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Hunan on the 29th of last month to discuss mortgaging 10 million yuan of Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds to obtain a loan. He is staying at the China Hotel. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency paid him a special visit yesterday. According to Mr. Yu, the 10 million yuan in public bonds has been approved by the Executive Yuan and is generally not a problem. To complete the Shanghai-Guangxi highway trunk line within a limited time, an initial loan of 250,000 yuan will be borrowed from banks such as the Bank of China for use. Everything has been negotiated, with Hunan's salt tax and highway revenue as collateral, at a monthly interest rate of 1%, to be repaid in five months. The mortgage matter for the public bonds has also been discussed with various banks and finalized. After the bond certificates are printed, he will come to Shanghai again to continue the process. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guarantee Fund for Issuing Public Bonds According to Director Yu, in order to complete the three highway trunk lines of Hunan-Guizhou, Hunan-Sichuan, and Hunan-Guangxi, the Hunan Provincial Government specially decided in a meeting to request the Central Government to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds to meet urgent needs. The issuance methods and guarantee fund for the public bonds have been submitted to the Central Government by the Provincial Government and have been approved by the Executive Yuan. Once approved by the Central Political Council, the bonds can be issued, and there is generally no problem. The guarantee fund will consist of Hunan's deed tax and the provincial business tax as the primary guarantees, and all highway revenue as the secondary guarantee. In the future, representatives will be sent by the Ministry of Finance, the Audit Department, the Hunan Provincial Government, the National Economic Council, and the banking community to form a Hunan Provincial Construction Bond Fund Custody Committee to ensure seriousness.</p>
<p>Determined Use and Mortgage Negotiation The use of the public bonds has been decided: one-third, or more than 3 million yuan, will be used to settle Hunan's old debts; two-thirds, or more than 6 million yuan, will be used to complete the three highways: Hunan-Guizhou, Hunan-Sichuan, and Hunan-Guangxi. During this trip to Shanghai, he has repeatedly contacted Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. With the assistance of the banking community, they have all expressed their approval of the mortgage principles. The Hunan Provincial Government plans to first solicit bids for printing the bond certificates, and then, depending on the need, mortgage the designated 6 million yuan in bond certificates to the banking community in installments. Therefore, the current contact with the banking community is only to exchange opinions and agree on principles. Once the public bonds are reviewed and approved by the Central Political Council and printing bids are solicited, he will come to Shanghai again to continue discussions.</p>
<p>Hunan-Guangxi Highway Loan Negotiated The Hunan Provincial Government has already started construction on the three highways of Hunan-Guizhou, Hunan-Sichuan, and Hunan-Guangxi according to plan. Commander-in-Chief Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission recently ordered the completion of the Hunan-Guangxi Highway for traffic within one month to facilitate transportation from Hunan to Guangxi and ordered the National Economic Council to allocate funds for subsidies. Although 50,000 yuan has been received for use, it is still far from enough. Therefore, during this trip to Shanghai, he contacted Zhang Gongquan, Tang Shoumin, and Chen Guangfu of the banking community to borrow 250,000 yuan. All negotiations have been completed. The loan will be provided by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, with a monthly interest rate of 1% and a term of five months, with Hunan's salt tax and road revenue as collateral. The contract has been drafted and will be brought back by Mr. Yu to report to the Provincial Government for approval. After approval, it will be formally signed in Changsha with the lending banks.</p>
<p>Hunan Province Builds Three Major Trunk Lines The Hunan Provincial Government is currently actively building three major highway trunk lines: (1) the Beijing-Guizhou trunk line, from Taohuaping in Hunan to Huang County on the border of Guizhou, approximately 400 li long, has already started construction and a portion has been opened to traffic; (2) the Beijing-Sichuan trunk line, from Taoyuan in Hunan to Youyang in Sichuan, approximately 400 li long, has already started construction and will be built in stages; (3) the Shanghai-Guangxi trunk line, from Hongqiao in Hunan to Huangsha River in Guangxi, approximately 300 li long, has already started construction and is scheduled to be completed for traffic within one month. After the completion of the above three trunk lines, transportation between the capital and the provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi will become more convenient.</p>
<p>Returning to Nanjing and then Hunan to Report Director Yu told the Xin Xin News Agency reporter at the end that after arriving in Shanghai, he once went to Nanjing to meet Commander-in-Chief Chiang to report on the highway construction situation and met with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to explain the guarantee fund and allocation of the 10 million yuan construction bonds. With the matters in Shanghai completed, he decided to take the 11:00 PM express train to Nanjing tonight (i.e., last night) to apply to the National Economic Council for subsidies for the Hunan-Guangxi highway project. He does not plan to stay in Nanjing for long and will return to Hunan to report.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Plans to Utilize Remaining Boxer Indemnity Funds</h3>
<p>To Build One New River Steamer and Two Motorboats</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways' loan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity totals 400,000 pounds. It was originally planned that 260,000 pounds would be used to build ocean liners and 140,000 pounds to build Yangtze River steamers. However, the cost of building the ocean liners reached over 346,000 pounds, leaving a balance of only about 50,000 pounds. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board has repeatedly sent letters to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company inquiring about this matter to resolve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Building a River Steamer The remaining Boxer Indemnity funds, calculated at the current gold price, amount to no more than 700,000 yuan, which is only enough to build one Yangtze River steamer domestically. If built in England according to the contract, it would not be enough to build even one vessel. The board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has repeatedly discussed this matter and decided that no matter what, the remaining Boxer Indemnity funds will be used to build one river steamer first and will not be diverted to other uses. It has repeatedly consulted with the Boxer Indemnity Committee and has been approved to build the steamer in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Two Motorboats In the end, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Boxer Indemnity Committee have agreed that one Yangtze River steamer, generally similar to the Taikoo Dockyard's Wusong steamer, will be built in China. In addition, two 500-ton motorboats will be built for use on the upper Yangtze River. The shortfall will be funded by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and a report has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for record. The designs of all the new river steamers are in the planning stage at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and construction will begin as soon as they are finalized.</p>

<h3>Sinking of the Taishan, Bound for England, Confirmed</h3>
<p>Bodies Retrieved 140 Miles Off Qingdao</p>
<p>Total Loss of Ship and Cargo Estimated at Over 300,000 Yuan</p>
<p>All 45 Crew Members Presumed Dead; Compensation to Be Provided</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Taishan, belonging to the Sanbei Shipping Company, disappeared en route from Qingdao to Shanghai, the British warship HMS Peterel recovered the bodies of four crew members of the ill-fated Taishan 140 nautical miles off Qingdao. The search continues in the coastal area. The company has decided to provide compensation according to the law. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>After Disappearance The Taishan left Qingdao at 2:00 PM on the 26th of last month, carrying 3,000 tons of coal bound for Shanghai. After encountering a strong wind and disappearing, the coastal radio station repeatedly called the Taishan, but received no response. It then telegraphed all coastal ships for help, but received no response. The (XNDF) signal received by the Changxing in Shanghai a few days ago was actually a radio signal from other ships calling the Taishan.</p>
<p>Confirmed by British Warship HMS Peterel, which was anchored in Weihaiwei, recovered four bodies wearing life preservers 140 nautical miles off Qingdao while sailing to Shanghai. The life preservers were marked with the name "Taishan." The warship telegraphed the British Consulate in Shanghai, which notified the Sanbei Shipping Company yesterday. The bodies have been transferred to the British warship.</p>
<p>Retrieving Bodies After receiving the report from the British Consulate, the Sanbei Shipping Company requested the British warship to continue searching for bodies. The British warship has dispatched small boats to search the coastal shallow water beaches and the location of the Taishan's accident, as well as other items on board, to confirm the incident.</p>
<p>All Crew Presumed Dead The captain of the Taishan, a Norwegian named Hai Lie, the comprador Lu Jingtang, the second mate Huang Yuanquan, the chief engineer Zheng Yongqing, the first assistant engineer Lou Longhua, the second assistant engineer Sun Wanqing, one foreman of the sailors, six sailors, one foreman of the stokers, nine stokers, two oilers, two carpenters, four helmsmen, one radio operator, and the chief steward, cook, and Western servants, totaling 45 people, are all presumed dead. The radio operator Yu Shoude had taken sick leave and was replaced by an agent sent by the company, and thus escaped the disaster.</p>
<p>Total Loss According to Yu Shunfu, assistant manager of the Sanbei Company, whom the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter met yesterday, the hull of the Taishan was in good condition. The company's insurance department had self-insured it for 100,000 yuan. The ship is currently valued at approximately 200,000 yuan, and the 3,000 tons of coal it was carrying are worth over 30,000 yuan. If it is confirmed that it has sunk, the total loss, including the crew, will be approximately 300,000 yuan. As for the crew members who died, compensation will be provided according to the law after confirmation.</p>
<p>Family Members of Crew Members All crew members of the Taishan, except the captain, were Chinese. Since the ship disappeared, family members and relatives of the crew members have gone to the Sanbei Company on Guangdong Road every day to inquire. After hearing that the British warship had recovered the bodies of the Taishan 140 nautical miles off Qingdao, they were extremely alarmed. Although they did not cry out loud, many shed tears. However, the company is still comforting them, as the bodies recovered by the British warship have not yet been identified.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Director of Jiangnan Shipyard Ma Deji Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Director of the Ping Sui Railway Bureau, Shen Chang, Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss the Recent Situation of Rectifying the Ping Sui Railway</h3>
<p>Revenue Increased by Half, Debt Restructuring Successful</p>
<p>Thoroughly Revamping Railway Administration, Emphasizing Technical Talents</p>
<p>Since the Ping Sui Railway was taken over and directly managed by the Ministry of Railways last summer, personnel have been sent to rectify it, and significant progress has been made. Shen Chang, Director of the Railway Bureau, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to meet with Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, to report on the railway administration. A Daily News reporter interviewed Mr. Shen at his hotel and inquired about the recent situation of the Ping Sui Railway. He provided a detailed account, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Revenue Increased Sharply Mr. Shen first answered the reporter's question about the revenue situation of the Ping Sui Railway. In the past seven years, the revenue was only over 7 million yuan. After rectification, the revenue increased sharply. The revenue for last month (November) reached 1.1 million yuan, and the revenue for 1934 is approximately 10.5 million yuan, an increase of half compared to before. As for expenditures, they have also been greatly reduced, saving 1 million yuan per year. The current expenditure is only 6 million yuan per year.</p>
<p>Restructuring Debt The railway's internal and external debts amount to 90 million yuan, of which Japanese debt accounts for approximately one-third. It has been impossible to restructure the debt in the past. Recently, through my efforts, I have been working on restructuring the debt. The Japanese debt has now been completely restructured, and one-third of the American debt has also been restructured. Debts to domestic banking groups, small material merchants, employee savings, and arrears have been restructured to 90%. As a result, the total amount of debt has been reduced to 60 million yuan, and interest has been suspended and the principal is being repaid. This year, 2 million yuan in cash has been paid out.</p>
<p>Improving Railway Administration Mr. Shen continued, "I am determined to thoroughly improve railway administration. The sleepers of the railway have not been replaced for ten years, and most of them are rotten. Since the Ministry of Railways took over, 500,000 sleepers have been replaced, costing 1 million yuan. 150 freight cars have been added, worth 900,000 yuan. In addition, approximately 1 million yuan has been added for machinery and parts. The stations west of Suiyuan have been completed for ten years, but have not been built. Now, the two major stations in Baotou and Salachi have been completed, and the remaining eight stations will be completed next year. The passenger cars have also been greatly renovated. There is a special express train once a day, with electric lights and heating equipment. Construction has also begun on three new trains, which will be completed next spring. The cost is only 25,000 yuan per car, which is almost half the price of imported cars."</p>
<p>Emphasizing Technology As for the sole guiding principle for rectifying the railway, it lies in emphasizing technical talents. Minister Gu believes that the Ping Sui Railway is notoriously difficult to manage, so technical personnel from various locations are selected based on their abilities. For example, Jin Shixuan, Director of the Transportation Department, is a leading expert in transportation studies in China. Pan Shanwen, Director of the Accounting Department, has been the manager of the Zhongfu Bank for more than ten years and has a long-standing reputation. The Directors of the Engineering and Mechanical Departments both have over 20 years of experience in their respective fields. As for lower-level staff, such as station masters and clerks, promotions and demotions are based on examination methods. I will stay in Shanghai for a few days and then return to Beijing to resume my duties."</p>

<p>Telegram from Luzon The Philippine authorities sent a telegram to Mayor Wu: (1) The first letter and telegram inquired whether Chinese merchants participating in the carnival to display goods could be exempted from customs duties. The telegram has requested General Manager Leg to find a way. If possible, taxes will only be levied on the sale of goods and inquire about the cost of establishing a Chinese goods display. The carnival has directly telegraphed the reply to you; (2) Exhibition samples, if the value is within 10,000 Resos (approximately 20,000 yuan) and it is declared that they will be shipped back within six months without being exported, can be exempted from taxes with a guarantee. As for the cost of temporary storage space, it depends on the quantity of goods and the area occupied, but the amount must be limited.</p>

The preparatory committee has decided to ship the exhibits to the Philippines on January 14th. If delayed any longer, it may be too late.</p>
<h3>Yarn Factory Association Held a Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Discuss Ways to Rescue Chinese Yarn</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, recently, Japanese yarn sales have suddenly increased, and the export volume has seen a sharp increase. The sales of Chinese yarn are becoming more sluggish. The National Federation of Chinese Yarn Factories held its 13th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at its headquarters on Avenue Edward at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss ways to rescue the declining yarn industry. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation The executive and supervisory committee members who attended the meeting yesterday included Rong Zongjing, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, Wang Qiyu, Huang Shoumin, Xue Chunsheng, Su Taiyu, Dong Zhongsheng, Yang Hanxi, Liu Mengjing, and others. Guo Shun chaired the meeting. It started at 2:00 PM. In addition to discussing the production, sales, and transportation of cotton yarn, the rest were general affairs matters. According to the committee members present, the discussions yesterday were limited to internal issues, and there was no need to publish the proposals. The issue of imposing unified taxes was also not discussed.</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing's Remarks According to Rong Zongjing, a giant in the yarn industry who has just returned from the Northwest after investigating the production and sales of cotton, "I went to Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces this time to inspect the agricultural production situation. I feel that there has been a significant improvement in wheat and cotton. Domestic yarn factories and flour mills will be able to stop relying on foreign wheat and cotton in the shortest possible time, saving the country 40 to 50 million yuan per year. The cotton seeds in Anyang and other counties in Henan and Shaanxi were improved varieties that I bought and distributed in Shanghai in previous years, and the quality is better than before. In my opinion, the cotton produced in Hebei is the best, but the production volume is very small and does not meet the needs of Shanghai yarn factories. I hope that people in the yarn industry will do their best to promote the cultivation of improved varieties and resist foreign cotton."</p>

<h3>Robbery in Broad Daylight on Guling Road, Two Robbers Captured Alive</h3>
<p>Older Sister Holds Young Child to Watch the Robbery</p>
<p>Child Injured by a Stray Bullet</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 1:30 PM, a certain Mr. Jia was walking near the intersection of Guling Road and Park Road when he was suddenly confronted by five bandits. Two of them were armed with handguns. They emerged from the side of the road, blocked his path, and ordered him to remain silent. Meanwhile, the unarmed bandits searched his person, and as a result, more than seventy yuan in paper money was robbed and scattered as the bandits fled. Upon seeing this, Mr. Jia frantically shouted for help, crying "Catch the robbers!" The bandits, in desperation, fired a shot backward. However, the nearby police officers had already been alerted and, upon hearing the gunshot, immediately drew their guns, gave chase, and returned fire. At the same time, neighboring police officers also came to encircle and apprehend the robbers. Although the bandits fought as they ran, they were gradually overwhelmed and scattered in flight. However, two of the bandits ran out of bullets and were cut off. They were captured alive by the police officers, and a handgun was seized. They were immediately taken to the police station for detention. However, when the police officers were returning fire at the bandits, a young child named Huang Erniang, aged two, who lived at No. 36 Shunxing Lane, Taiping Lane, Park Road, was being held by an older sister playing at the entrance. Hearing the commotion of catching robbers, the older sister, not realizing the danger, actually went to watch while holding Huang Erniang. As a result, Huang Erniang was injured by a stray bullet. Afterwards, a police vehicle sent her to Bao Long Hospital for treatment. Whether her life is in danger is difficult to say.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Department Breaks Up a Major Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Gambling Establishments are Never Allowed in the French Concession</p>
<p>According to news from the French Concession Police Department yesterday, recently there have been rumors that Mr. Meriel, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, has taken leave to return to his country, and that these people have obtained permission from the new French Consul who is acting for Mr. Meriel, to open gambling establishments in the French Concession. After a secret investigation by the French Concession Police Department, it was found that a certain Mr. Pan had arranged to meet on November 30th at a hotel on Dongxinqiao Street. The police department sent a detective, posing as a representative of a capitalist, to negotiate. Mr. Pan said that he could obtain a document from Wu Zhang, but it would require 225,000 yuan, and there must be deposits in the bank. Mr. Pan arranged for the detective to have a second meeting at a restaurant on North Sichuan Road that evening, and a third meeting was arranged for December 1st. On that day, during the negotiations, there was another detective posing as a capitalist. At that time, there were eight swindlers who finalized the previous terms and confirmed that 1 million yuan would be deposited in the bank. A contract was signed on the spot and handed over to the capitalist (i.e., the detective posing as such). The swindlers agreed that a certain Mr. Zhou, who had not yet arrived, would lobby the French Consulate. At that time, five detectives who were stationed in the adjacent room rushed into the room and arrested the swindlers on the spot and brought them to the police station. They admitted the above facts and confessed to seeking capitalists to open gambling establishments in the French Concession. Important documents related to the flower association organization were found on the swindlers. Under interrogation by the French police, one of the defendants confessed that the French Consul-General was about to take leave to return to his country, and the new Consul had been instructed by the French government to allow the opening of five gambling establishments. However, the owners of the gambling establishments would have to pay 45,000 yuan per month to cover various expenses. The French police are now stating that the rumor is completely untrue, and that gambling establishments are never allowed in the French Concession, regardless of the nationality of the people. The Police Department hopes that residents will report any information about similar fraud schemes at any time.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Avenue Montegnie, One Robber Shot and Captured</h3>
<p>Stray Bullet Injures Maid, Miss Shen Er</p>
<p>Madam Xie Xu, a woman from Zhenjiang in her late thirties, residing at No. 2, Jinyu Lane, Avenue Montegnie, French Concession, was suddenly visited by five robbers armed with handguns at 6:10 PM last night. They broke into the inner room, first placed everyone in the house under surveillance, and forbade them from making any noise. Then they divided up and searched the premises, looting 300 yuan in banknotes, about 200 yuan in silver dollars, a diamond ring worth about 200 yuan, and a large quantity of clothing. They carried the stolen goods out and fled. At that time, the victim immediately followed and reported to Police Officer Qian, No. 378, who was on patrol. The police officer immediately gave chase with his gun. The robbers opened fire on the police to resist arrest, firing and fleeing along the way. Police Officer Qian also fired fiercely. One of the robbers, while fleeing near the Franco-Chinese School, was shot in the right waist and fell to the ground. A six-round, eight-inch handgun was seized. The French police department had already dispatched a large number of detectives upon hearing the news, first sending the wounded robber to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and then tracking down the remaining accomplices. However, when the bullets were flying, a maid named Shen Er, from the Zhong family at No. 39 North Lion Lane in the city, was passing by delivering dinner when her right hand was grazed by a stray bullet, but it was not seriously injured.</p>

<h3>Self-Use Rickshaw Pullers Must Wear Registration Armbands</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Sends Police Officers for Strict Inspection</p>
<p>Since the Public Concession Municipal Council began registering self-use rickshaw pullers, each registered rickshaw puller has been issued an armband with a white number on a blue enamel background, designated to be tied to the left arm for identification. However, since its implementation, all rickshaw pullers have deliberately disobeyed. Starting today, the Municipal Council will send a large number of police officers to inspect the roads. Those who are found not wearing the armband will be ordered to wear it immediately.</p>
<h3>Jiyuan Dharma Assembly Establishes a Porridge Kitchen</h3>
<p>The Jiyuan Dharma Assembly on Avenue Road, in keeping with the compassionate spirit of the Buddha, established a shelter during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, housing thousands of displaced compatriots. After the war ended, they were provided with funds to return to their hometowns. They also hold annual winter relief efforts, establishing factories to provide porridge, benefiting many impoverished people. This autumn, they initiated a Liyang emergency relief effort, joining with various charity organizations and the Wuxi Red Swastika Society to raise more than 60,000 yuan, purchasing grain to distribute according to the number of family members. The disaster victims were able to survive. As the severe winter is approaching, it is difficult for the poor people of Shanghai to make a living. The southwest corner is a particularly concentrated area of laborers and coolies. The assembly will continue its old practice of establishing a porridge kitchen at the site of the Xieqiao Yongxi Church. It is reported that Assembly President Wang Yiting and Xu Qianlin have appointed Yu Yuanjue and Feng Liantang to expedite preparations and start the distribution earlier. It is planned to begin in early December. However, the assembly lacks funds, and it is hoped that people of good faith from all walks of life will provide strong support.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Bureau's Xiaodongmen Receiving Office Relocated and Merged</h3>
<p>Merged into the Nanshi Bund Post Office</p>
<p>Effective from the 3rd of this month</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the public and save public funds, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau in this port to implement postal and telegraphic integration, that is, all post offices have already accepted telegrams, which is convenient for all walks of life. Now, because there are many post offices near the Xiaodongmen Zhonghua Road receiving office, such as the Bund Post Office, Dananmen Post Office, and Sanpailou Post Office, it is already convenient for merchants to send telegrams. Therefore, it ordered to be cut and merged. According to the spokesperson of the bureau on Sichuan Road yesterday, the Xiaodongmen receiving office had already been ordered to be cut and merged. However, because many people in the Nanshi area sent telegrams there, suddenly withdrawing it would inevitably cause overcrowding in the Bund Post Office. Therefore, it negotiated with the post office to add equipment and install reporting machine circuits in the post office. It has now been completed, and from December 3rd, the Xiaodongmen office has been closed and announced to all sectors that if there are telegrams, they can be sent at the receiving office in the nearby Bund Post Office.</p>
<h3>Maid Colludes with Criminals to Extort from Her Master</h3>
<p>The Master Smokes Opium and is Extremely Terrified</p>
<p>2,000 Yuan Used to Settle the Matter</p>
<p>丨丨The defendant Xu Gang has been arrested丨丨</p>
<p>Huashan Chief Shang Wu and Detective Wang Youshan of the Huishi Police Department, along with Western Chief Yang, arrested a suspect named Xu Gang, a native of Shaoxing, at the rooftop garden of the Xinxin Company on Guizhou Road at approximately 9:00 PM the night before. He was suspected of using the name of Xu Qihu to gather accomplices to extort 2,000 yuan. He was taken to the police station for detention and sent to the 8th Criminal Court of the First Special Court the next morning to apply for detention. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, rose to present the case, saying that two months ago, Xu received information that a certain wealthy household with the surname of 　, located at No. 19 Baoqing Lane, Tianjin Road, Hongkou, was smoking opium. He immediately colluded with Li Agen, Feng Ahui, and others to go to the household to demand 2,000 yuan as a birthday gift, otherwise they would report it to the police. The master was terrified upon hearing this, so he was forced to write a check for 2,000 yuan and handed it over to the defendants. After obtaining the cash, they divided it up. The method of distribution was that Xu, Li, Feng, and two others named Jia and Yi each received 300 yuan, and the remaining 500 yuan was given to the maid of the household, because the information about the household's wealth and opium smoking was leaked to Jia and Yi by the maid, who then passed it on to Xu and the others. Therefore, after Xu was arrested at the Xinxin rooftop garden last night, he confessed to the previous events and stated that they had previously discussed and conspired at the Leyuan Teahouse on Jiujiang Road. The detectives obtained the confession and went to No. 19 Baoqing Lane to investigate. Because it was late at night, the household was already asleep and refused to open the door, so they did not enter. They now request that Xu be detained for investigation. Questioned by Xu Gang, he confessed, "I only heard Li Agen and the others talk about this matter, but I did not actually conspire with them. According to Li, the mother's brother of the certain surname came to Shanghai from his hometown and borrowed 30 yuan from him but was refused, so he planned to extort money. I was arrested because I was chatting about this matter outside." Judge Wu Yanqi verified　 and ordered Xu to be detained until Friday for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The Son of a University Professor Behaves Absurdly</h3>
<p>Pawning Clothes to Smoke Opium and Falsely Reporting a Robbery</p>
<p>Forging a Fake Note to Defraud His Father</p>
<p>Cao Yuanfu, the son of Cao Shuheng (52 years old this year), a native of Suzhou who is currently a professor at Jiaotong University, residing at No. 9, Lane 336, Route Frelupt, French Concession, is 24 years old this year. Although he once studied at a certain middle school, he recently dropped out and stayed at home, not engaging in honest work, wandering outside, associating with bad friends, and addicted to opium. He was once arrested and sent to court for punishment, but he did not repent. On the evening of the 30th of last month, Cao, accompanied by his friend Wu Baosheng (32 years old, from Shandong) who lived at No. 144 Xinglong Street, Dapuqiao, went to the thatched shed at No. 　 of Jiageng Lane, Rue Kin-Kiang where the family of a fellow named Ye Jiazhen (32 years old) was smoking red pills. Later, because neither of them had any money on them, they had no money to pay, and Ye refused to give them credit. Cao took off the clothes he was wearing and temporarily pawned them. Then Cao changed his mind and thought that the weather was cold, he was weak and thinly clothed, and he had no money to use. He had an idea and discussed with Wu and Ye that Cao would write a fake promissory note, stating that he borrowed 50 yuan from Wu　sheng, and asked Ye Jiazhen to act as a guarantor. After 　the fake promissory note, he asked Wu and Ye to go to his father, Cao Shuheng, to seek compensation. After obtaining the money, the three of them would divide it up. After completing this fake procedure, Cao went home to sleep. His father saw him wearing short clothes and asked him where his clothes were. Cao replied that he had been robbed on the road. His father asked why he had not reported it to the police since he had been robbed. At this point, Cao Yuanfu reported to the French police station that night, claiming that he had been robbed of his clothes on the street in Jiageng Lane at 4:00 AM. Detective Ni Jinrong, accompanied by Cao, investigated the scene and asked Cao what kind of robbers had robbed him. Cao pointed to his friends Wu Baosheng and Ye Jiazhen. The detective then arrested Wu and Ye at their addresses and found the clothes. Only then did it come to light that Cao had pawned his clothes to Ye because he had no money to smoke red pills. Later, he colluded to write a fake promissory note in an attempt to get money from his father. The detective reported the information to the police chief, accusing Cao of falsely reporting a robbery and colluding with Wu and Ye to forge a fake promissory note in an attempt to defraud. He ordered that Cao, Wu, and Ye be arrested and detained together. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution according to law. Judge Sun Penghai conducted a trial at the 8th Criminal Court and immediately sentenced Cao Yuanfu to 40 days of detention for repeatedly smoking opium substitutes. Wu Baosheng and Ye Jiazhen were each sentenced to 20 days of detention for smoking opium substitutes. In addition, Ye was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for forcibly detaining the clothes as a warning. The remaining charges against the three defendants were dismissed.</p>

<h3>Major Surgery Room Completed at Hongqiao Sanitarium</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Hongqiao Sanitarium in western Shanghai has strived for perfection in various medical facilities. Its major surgery room has now been completed. It is divided into a steam sterilization room, a changing room, an equipment room, and a waiting room, which is connected to the west side of the surgery room, making it more convenient to use. The surgery room has air-conditioning and heating equipment, so the indoor temperature can be adjusted according to the change of seasons. The entire room uses a rubber floor, which can eliminate disturbing sound waves. The surroundings of the room are a very quiet green, with yellow tiles that do not reflect light, which can avoid glare. When performing eye, nose, ear, and throat surgery, there is also black light equipment. The lighting method adopted is a Zeiss reflector lamp without shadows. Regardless of the position, surgery can be performed on the operating table. It is now being used skillfully. In the past month, more than a dozen major surgeries, including cesarean sections, have been performed in the hospital, and the results have been excellent. Doctors and patients alike have found it very convenient.</p>
<h3>The New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory Held a Banquet Last Night for Overseas Chinese Representatives from Singapore</h3>
<p>The New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, a most famous domestic pharmaceutical manufacturer, has established no fewer than several dozen sales offices at home and abroad. Recently, Mr. Huang Manshi, a representative of the Overseas Chinese General Chamber of Commerce from the factory's Singapore branch, returned to China to negotiate the collection of famous products from various provinces in northern and southern China for display and exhibition in Southeast Asia. The factory's manager, Mr. Xu Guanqun, and factory director, Mr. Zhao Rutiao, and others, specially hosted a dinner last night (the 3rd) at Jin Long Restaurant to welcome Mr. Huang. Those in attendance included industrialists and leaders of domestic goods factories such as Guo Shun, Li Dachao, Qian Chengxu, Yu Zuoting, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Jie, Xiang Yuan, Fang Yexian, Cheng Shouchong, Xu Jilong, and Hu Xiyuan, totaling several dozen people, making for a grand occasion. The gathering ended with everyone satisfied at ten o'clock at night.</p>
<h3>Three Ring Brand Products Sell Well at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>In recent years, there has been a general trend in our country's clothing reform towards simplicity. The fundamental purpose of clothing is to be lightweight, warm, and comfortable. As a result, imports of wool clothing and fabrics amount to over 4.4 million yuan annually, which is deeply regrettable. It is found that the Lianhua Wool Weaving Factory, located in Hele Lane, North Henan Road, Shanghai, was established in the twelfth year of the Republic of China. It has long produced "Three Ring" brand white wool Interlock men's and women's underwear, jacquard woolen sweaters, thick and thin wool scarves, wool men's and women's socks, swimwear, and other products, which have been popular throughout the country and are widely praised. Recently, with the cold weather and the arrival of frost, the factory's wool products, in addition to being shipped to other locations long ago, are also in short supply in Shanghai. Their spirit of fighting against foreign goods is highly commendable. Recently, the factory's manager, Mr. Chen Zuogan, has further dispatched personnel to supervise all staff to rush to fulfill a large order of Interlock underwear for a certain warship anchored in the Huangpu River, which shows that the factory's products are excellent and its business is thriving, truly a good phenomenon in the advocacy of domestic goods. This reporter hopes that the factory will increase production and strive for excellence, to reverse the outflow of our country's wool clothing and fabric imports. It is also heard that the factory's latest 1935 style swimwear samples have been produced and will be rushed into production soon.</p>
<h3>The Resignation of Cao Tonglu, Chief of the Second District of Shanghai County</h3>
<p>The original second district of Shanghai County consisted of the old boundaries of Caoxing and Tangwan townships. Since the establishment of the municipal government and the division of the city and county, the two townships were merged into the second district, a district office was set up, and a district chief was appointed to manage local affairs. This summer, the former district chief, Ding Jiren, resigned due to illness, and it was difficult to find a replacement for a time, so Assistant Li Youtian temporarily took over. Recently, County Magistrate Pan, in view of the importance of district administration, specially selected Mr. Cao Tonglu to take over as district chief in accordance with the rules for the selection of district chiefs, and submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. Now, Instruction No. 10967 from the Department of Civil Affairs states, "The vacancy of the district chief of the second district of the county is now filled by Cao Tonglu. You are to appoint him to act as an agent and report the date of appointment for investigation." Mr. Cao, considering the complexity of district administration and his inability to bear the heavy responsibility, submitted his resignation by mail yesterday. The resignation is excerpted below: "I hereby submit a request to resign from the position of acting district chief of the second district due to my shallow talent and lack of reputation. I am untalented and unexpectedly received this honor, which has flattered me. I have studied since childhood and engaged in business after adulthood, having been away from my hometown for a long time and lacking credibility. I am neither familiar with the affairs of the people nor knowledgeable about worldly matters. Although the position of district chief is small, it concerns the people directly. It requires both the ability to manage the world and the talent to promote benefits and eliminate abuses. Mercy and might must be combined to meet the expectations of the honorable county magistrate and to gain the trust of the people of the entire district. I believe that my humble talents are utterly inadequate to cope with the situation. Rather than occupying the position in the future, it is better to give way today. I hereby submit this request to your honorable county magistrate to approve my resignation from the position of acting district chief of the second district and to select someone virtuous and capable to assist in district administration. This would not only be fortunate for me alone but would also bring happiness to the entire district. My sincere heart hopes for a clear understanding. I am extremely apprehensive as I await your orders. Respectfully submitted."</p>

With the efforts of the team leaders to move forward and actively recruit, the association achieved great results.

<h3>You Sheng Troupe Initiates a Bicycle Trip to Songjiang</h3>
<p>The You Sheng Travel Troupe, located at the corner of Niuzhuang Road and Lloyd Road in Shanghai, has been promoting travel with remarkable results.

<h3>The Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory is Building a Factory Building</h3>
<p>The Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory, after purchasing the factory site on Tiyuhui Road, North Sichuan Road, immediately began drawing up plans and preparing for construction. However, because the equipment of a pharmaceutical factory is different from that of an ordinary factory building, experts were repeatedly asked to design it. After discussions by the design committee Chu Minyi, Zhou Bangjun, Xia Xishi, etc., it was decided to use the drawings of architect Lu Juchu. In addition to paying attention to light, air, convenience, and novelty in the construction of the factory building, in line with scientific principles, the front office space is also completely new. Yesterday, the owner of the Xinyuji Construction Factory went to the preparation office of the pharmaceutical factory at the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Horse Road to sign a contract for construction. Construction can begin as soon as the license is obtained.</p>
<h3>Wu Song Long Mao Zhuang Teller Absconds with Funds</h3>
<p>The Long Mao Qian Zhuang in Songxing Road, Wusong, has been open for decades and has the most outstanding credit. Its daily business is quite large. A teller named Ni A'er, a native of Chongming, has been working at the firm for seven or eight years. He has not made any mistakes, so the manager trusts him very much. The afternoon before yesterday, the firm entrusted Ni A'er to carry 3,040 yuan in banknotes to the Yong'an Yarn Factory on Yunzao Road. Unexpectedly, Ni, seeing such a large sum of money, harbored ill intentions and absconded with the money. The firm sent people to search everywhere but could not find him. Yesterday, they reported the case to the Wusong Police Department, requesting an arrest warrant.</p>
<h3>Painter Accused of Abandonment by His Wife</h3>
<p>Further Investigation is Needed</p>
<p>The Hearing will be Rescheduled for Further Inquiry</p>
<p>Cheng Yaosheng, a famous painter from Anhui, was previously sued by Li Xiujin, claiming to be his wife, for abandonment in the First Special Court. Because a wife cannot bring a private prosecution against her husband, the case was dismissed. Now, Ms. Li has filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court to confirm her identity. Yesterday morning, Judge Mo opened the Fourth Civil Court to hear the case. Li Xiujin stated that she did indeed formally marry Cheng and lived with him in the Miao residence on Ximiao Street in Changzhou. She also presented the matchmaker, Yang Guisheng, a colleague of Cheng Yaosheng's at Jiheng Pawnshop, and the painter Zhou Baisheng and his wife as witnesses. Yang Guisheng filed a statement proving that he was the matchmaker for Cheng and Li's marriage, and that Cheng was adopted into Li's family, etc. Then, Tang, the wife of Zhou Baisheng, filed a statement saying, "I and Cheng Li Xiujin are like sisters. After Li married Cheng, they lived in the Miao residence on Ximiao Street in Changzhou, and I also lived there. At that time, although I was engaged to Zhou Baisheng, I had not yet married." Cheng Yaosheng, on the other hand, said, "I have an original wife, Xi, who currently lives on Taiping Bridge in Taixing. Everyone knows this. The court can investigate." Judge Mo Runhua, considering that the case still required further investigation, ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for further inquiry.</p>

<h3>Misdialed Mechanism Causes Guard Corps Member to be Shot</h3>
<p>Gu A'xiang, a 24-year-old native of Anting, who lives at 86 Chongde Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, is a member of the Third Platoon of the Eighth Team of the Shanghai North District Guard Corps on Guangzhao Road. As the winter defense began, each member went on duty as usual. Yesterday evening, Gu returned home after completing his duties and unloaded his self-provided pistol, removing the bullets. Unexpectedly, there was still one bullet in the barrel. Because Gu A'xiang misdialed the mechanism, there was a sudden bang, and the bullet left the barrel, hitting his left leg, causing profuse bleeding. He was later sent to Baolong Hospital by someone in a vehicle for treatment.</p>
<h3>Employee Embezzlement Case of Automobile Company Reopens</h3>
<p>Zhang Hesheng, Gu Songqiao and other employees of the Huxiang Automobile Company embezzled more than 230 yuan of public funds and instructed accountant Wu Ciyin to register it as public relations expenses for the Public Security Bureau. The Public Works Bureau discovered this and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the local court. Prosecutor Xiao thoroughly investigated and prosecuted the case in the Criminal Court. Judge Sun Jikang held a public hearing once, the details of which have been recorded in previous reports. This case was again heard in the Fifth Court by Judge Sun yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, ordering Zhang Hesheng and Zhang Songqiao, who were in custody, to be brought to court. According to their confessions, the money and account books were managed by Chief Accountant Wu Ciyin, and they requested a thorough investigation. Next, the witness Gu Liangru testified, "I am 40 years old and from Jiading. I asked the Deputy Manager of the company, 'Who manages the money at the Shanghai Station?' He replied, 'Ni Guangyao.' I asked, 'When did the automobile company open?' He replied, 'June 1st.' I asked, 'What kind of account books does the automobile company use?' He replied, 'We used Chinese account books first, and then switched to foreign books.' I asked, 'Where are the previous account books?' He replied, 'At Wu Ciyin's place.' I asked, 'What does Zhang Hesheng manage?' He replied, 'Repairing machines.'" Finally, Mr. Gao, the chairman of the company's board of directors, testified, "Wu Ciyin has gone to Suzhou for business, so I was instructed to come as a representative." The judge asked, "They said that the draft accounts are with Wu Ciyin, do you know about this?" He replied, "According to Manager Ni Guangyao, the draft accounts are at the Nanxiang Station." The judge then ordered Mr. Gao to present the draft accounts at the next hearing for further review. The defendants were taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Bestial Behavior of a Servant in a Westerner's Home</h3>
<p>Fu Wu, a 34-year-old woman from Suzhou, works as an amah (nursemaid) in a Westerner's home at 69 Avenue Albert in the French Concession. She has a ten-year-old daughter named Jinbao, who accompanies her. During the day, Jinbao attends a small school on Rue Maughi. Xu Yanzhang, a 23-year-old man from Shandong, works as a servant in a Westerner's home at 17 Rue Macleod in Hongkou. Because he is acquainted with the head servant and other servants at 69 Avenue Albert, Xu often goes to 69 Avenue Albert to hang out or play mahjong. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, at 4:30 PM, Xu, having finished his work and having nothing to do, went to 69 Avenue Albert again to play mahjong with the head servant and other servants. At 6:30 PM, the chimney of the Westerner's home suddenly caught fire, and the Westerner called the fire brigade. The head servant and other servants who were playing mahjong all rushed outside to watch the firefighting. Xu, seeing that the amah Fu Wu's daughter, Jinbao, was alone in the room, was suddenly overcome with lust. He broke into the room and picked up the girl, intending to rape her. He used his fingers to dig into the girl's lower body, causing her to be injured, scratched, and bleed. The girl cried out in pain, and Xu released her and fled. When Fu Wu found out that her daughter's lower body was bleeding and Xu had fled, she reported the case to the French police and sent the girl to the hospital for examination. Fortunately, the hymen was not broken, but the exterior was scratched by fingers. She was treated and Detective Zhang Shan of the baojia, together with detectives from the Huishan Police Station, arrested Xu at 17 Rue Macleod the next day and brought him to the case. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the police station explained the case, and then the plaintiff Fu Wu and her daughter appeared in court to recount the experience of being injured. The judge, considering that it concerned public morals, prohibited spectators. The defendant was defended by lawyer Wu Kaisheng. After the judge Cao Jun heard the case, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for further investigation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Citizens' Association Petitions the Legislative Yuan to Amend the Progressive Stamp Tax Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association yesterday petitioned the Legislative Yuan of the National Government to amend the current stamp tax law to comply with public opinion, stating that the stamp tax law is not in line with commercial conditions and requesting that it be amended to protect commercial interests. The association stated that it received a letter from the Third Branch, which stated that it had read in the newspaper that the Legislative Yuan had recently passed a stamp tax plan that calculates the stamp tax on the most frequent items on the market, such as invoices and receipts, using a progressive method, which means that one cent must be added for every ten yuan. Upon hearing this, they were extremely shocked. It is found that stamp tax in Europe and the United States is a simple and light tax, but the regulations promulgated in our country in recent years are not only extremely harsh and cumbersome, but also easily lead to faults and severe penalties. Therefore, the mention of stamp tax is often criticized by the world. Recently, all industries have been declining, and commercial conditions have been deteriorating. The old stamp tax regulations have already caused great pain. However, our government officials have not alleviated the people's suffering but have instead increased the tax by tens or even dozens of times. With such heavy oppression, our people have no way to breathe, let alone survive. Moreover, this progressive method can only be handled by those who have studied accounting. Our country is backward, and society still retains the morbid state of centuries ago. Most stores are run by rural brokers who will be unable to cope with this brand-new stamp tax law. If they cannot cope, they will be punished. As a result, the government will mobilize tax officials and police, and the masses of people will be subject to the heavy burden of stamp tax, unable to escape. Therefore, they dare to represent the citizens of this district and directly petition, requesting that the situation be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan. They earnestly request that the suffering of the people be considered, that the newly established plan be withdrawn, and that the existing regulations be maintained to protect the people's livelihood and alleviate commercial difficulties. All of this was reported to the association. It is found that the points mentioned are not without merit. Moreover, since the new stamp tax law was promulgated, merchants in various places have felt inconvenienced and have filed petitions for amendment. In law, it is essential to suit public opinion. The progressive method stipulated in the new stamp tax law is not only harsh and detailed but also does not understand public opinion. It should be amended. It is appropriate to prepare a document and submit it to your honorable court for review, earnestly requesting that your request be approved, as it would be a great benefit. Respectfully submitted to Sun, President of the Legislative Yuan, by Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Yichen, and Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Finance Bureau Considers the Request of Brokerage Firms to Change Regulations</h3>
<p>Draft Processing Opinions Have Been Prepared</p>
<p>Submitted to the Municipal Government for Approval</p>
<p>The various brokerage associations in this city have reported in various newspapers that the brokerage commission has been restricted too low in the brokerage business regulations promulgated by the municipal government, and they have repeatedly requested that the stamp tax regulations be revised. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau, this case was previously ordered by the municipal government to be reviewed and discussed, and ten abridged versions of the various industry associations were forwarded by the municipal secretariat. After detailed review by the bureau, it was found that the statements made by the associations regarding the huge expenses of Shanghai brokerage firms and the fact that the brokerage commission limit of only 3% of the cargo price is insufficient to maintain operations are true. However, the brokerage commission limit specified in the Shanghai Brokerage Business Regulations is based on the third item of the method for organizing stamp tax decided at the National Finance Conference. Whether the limit can be changed has been submitted to the municipal government to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for review and handling to resolve the issue. Regarding the various points raised by the associations to amend the regulations, those that do not have a major impact on stamp tax revenue have also been adopted as much as possible to ensure that tax revenue and commercial conditions are considered simultaneously. Since the stamp tax is designated for education funds, the bureau will issue 42,000 yuan to the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office this year, so it cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Following the request, which affects the tax amount, the brokerage tax is an old local tax. The remaining articles of the Brokerage Business Regulations, as well as the commodity lists, etc., are all based on the original Jiangsu Provincial Brokerage Regulations, with reference to the drafting. There is no major change. Brokerage firms that have expired should pay taxes and exchange certificates in accordance with the regulations. Those that have not expired should apply for verification. Before the brokerage commission limit is determined, a request has been made to postpone the implementation of the promulgated regulations. As for the request from the various industry associations to change the brokerage certificates to be certified and collected by the associations, it is found that various taxes in this city have always been collected directly by the bureau's various tax collection offices as a principle. If various brokerage firms voluntarily guarantee and collect certificates through their industry associations, the bureau will not prohibit it. However, the various associations cannot force the various brokerage firms to entrust collection on their behalf. The entire case has now been prepared by the bureau with processing opinions and submitted to the municipal government for approval, and it should be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>The Closing of the Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Exhibition Yesterday</h3>
<p>15,000 Spectators Praised It Satisfied</p>
<p>Standard Account Tables and Documents Begin Distribution</p>
<p>The Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Exhibition, which opened on December 1 and continued for three days, closed yesterday. Among the three days, the number of visitors was the highest on the day before yesterday (Sunday), totaling more than 15,000 people, all of whom expressed satisfaction. This can be called an unprecedented grand occasion. A continuation of the various situations is recorded below.</p>
<p>A Special Room will be Opened to Display the Society's Public Exhibition: Yesterday was the last day, and there was still a considerable crowd of visitors. From morning to evening, there were approximately 5,000 people, especially in the afternoon. In addition to general business and accounting personnel, many groups of students from organizations and schools came to visit, such as the China Vocational School, the Zhijiang Vocational High School, the Wulun Vocational School, the Shanghai Provincial No. 3 Vocational School, the Shanghai Girls' High School, the Minli High School, and the Qingxin High School. The students were led by teachers and visited under the separate reception of important employees of the Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm, who provided detailed explanations and distributed various printed materials. When reporters visited the association, they saw that most of the visitors at the various exhibition locations carefully reviewed the cases on display, attentively examining them. Some even took out paper and pens and copied down the organizational system of various accounting books and the classification contents of the accounts on the spot for reference after returning. This is because these materials are suitable for practical application, so they are considered treasures by those engaged in bookkeeping practice. It is heard that the association also plans to open a special room in the Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm after the closing of the exhibition to continue displaying various materials so that those who were unable to visit the exhibition will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>Important Slogans Explained: In addition to the various accounting book examples, books, magazines, and charts and slogans mentioned in previous reports, the society's exhibition content also included many newly added accounting instructions and incisive slogans yesterday, which were hung in various places. Four are recorded below: (1) We advocate reforming Chinese bookkeeping based on China's inherent system, adopting the world's latest theories, and using the most economical and effective methods. (2) Chinese bookkeeping has a history of thousands of years and has its own value. How can we abandon it ourselves? (3) The advantages of Chinese bookkeeping are: 1. The theory is simple and clear; 2. The method is simple and convenient; 3. It is popular and easy to understand; 4. It saves expenses. The disadvantages are: 1. There is no fixed classification of accounts; 2. There is no fixed organization of accounting books; 3. There is no fixed format of account styles; 4. There are no fixed rules of accounting methods. Therefore, it is a pity to abandon it, and it is easier to improve it. (4) Improving Chinese bookkeeping must apply scientific methods, be based on accounting principles, seek to be practically applicable, and be premised on economic principles. As for whether the bookkeeping books and writing materials are domestic or foreign goods, whether the format of the accounting books is horizontal or vertical, and even whether the text and numbers used for bookkeeping are Chinese or Western, all of these are secondary issues and there are no insurmountable obstacles. We believe that if we want to use domestic paper and pens and take into account bookkeeping habits, we should continue to use the vertical format for registration. In the future, foreign paper and pens can be self-made, and if accounting personnel are accustomed to horizontal writing, they may also change to horizontal recording. As for the account theory and accounting methods of Chinese bookkeeping, they are simple, convenient, and in line with the concepts of Easterners, and they are easy for the general public to understand. We advocate maintaining this from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The Issuance of Standard Account Tables: The improved Chinese accounting book forms prepared by Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm were printed and distributed by the Standard Document Manufacturing and Sales Office. All of these were displayed this time. It is heard that because of the good paper quality, solid binding, and lower prices than ordinary popular ones, all visitors considered them very economical and practical. These account book forms could have been ordered on the spot during the exhibition period. It is heard that a total of more than 200 companies have ordered them in recent days, which also shows the depth of the general merchants' trust in improved Chinese bookkeeping. It is now heard that the Standard Account Table Document Manufacturing and Sales Office has printed many exquisite samples. Anyone who attaches a two-cent stamp can request a copy. In addition to the Standard Account Table Document Manufacturing and Sales Office at 123 Avenue Edward VII, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Mechanized Domestic Goods Factory United Association, the New Sound News Agency, the World Book Company, the Datong Book Company, the Scientific Arts Equipment Hall, the Practical Science and Arts Hall, and the Modern Book Company are now selling them.</p>
<p>At the request of the various professions, it is also in accordance with the tax amount. In addition, the brokerage tax is an old local donation and tax. The remaining articles of the Brokerage Business Regulations, as well as the commodity lists, etc., are all based on the original Jiangsu Provincial Brokerage Regulations, with reference to the drafting, and there is no major change. Brokerage firms that have expired should pay taxes and exchange certificates in accordance with the regulations. Those that have not expired should apply for verification. Before the brokerage commission limit is determined, a request has been made to postpone the implementation of the promulgated regulations. As for the request from the various industry associations to change the brokerage certificates to be certified and collected by the associations, it is found that various taxes in this city have always been collected directly by the bureau's various tax collection offices as a principle. If various brokerage firms voluntarily guarantee and collect certificates through their industry associations, the bureau will not prohibit it. However, the various associations cannot force the various brokerage firms to entrust collection on their behalf. The entire case has now been prepared by the bureau with processing opinions and submitted to the municipal government for approval, and it should be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>The Tax Affairs Department Organizes a New Life Movement Association</h3>
<p>The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance yesterday received Announcement No. 1 from the New Life Movement Committee of the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Only with a strong people can there be a strong country, and only with a healthy body can there be a healthy spirit. Therefore, strengthening the body has become a recognized and necessary matter to promote in the current trend. In our country, during the Three Dynasties, the Qin and Han dynasties, emphasis was placed on sports, and it was a common custom. The so-called 'Three times for farming, one time for military training' was the slogan of the Three Dynasties. Archery and chariot driving were given equal importance with rites and music, which was the custom during the Zhou and Qin dynasties. Civil affairs and military preparations were equally important, which was the habit during the two Han dynasties. These are all recorded in history and are clearly verifiable. Later, the rulers used ignorance to control the people, and the morale of the scholars declined. The teachings of Buddhism and Taoism flourished in the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties, and the system of science flourished in the Tang, Ming, and Qing dynasties. People buried themselves in books and stopped talking about military affairs, resulting in the weakening of the race and the slackening of all affairs. The name of 'sick man' became a common saying. Treading on frost leads to hard ice. Learning from the past will prevent future mistakes. We cannot have deep regret over the addition of adversity. There is a reason for this. Chairman Chiang promotes the New Life Movement, considering it an important tool for the revival of the nation. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are marked as the goals, and new regulations are set for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Special emphasis is placed on the improvement of sports. The people of the country are also gradually awakening and paying attention to it. This committee was established by order. In addition to strictly implementing the work plan outline promulgated by the general assembly, we now plan to promote sports, starting with 'netball' and 'national martial arts.' Comrade Deng Xian is recommended as the netball instructor, and Comrade Wang Zhijun is recommended as the national martial arts instructor. We will separately solicit members and organize practice. We hope that from now on, we can wash away the sickly appearance of pale faces and thin muscles and train hard men with bronze muscles and iron bones to shoulder arduous tasks and save the country from disaster. All my comrades should not lag behind. The registration locations and dates are as follows: (1) Each of the departments should separately solicit trainees for 'netball' and 'national martial arts' and submit a list to Wang Zhijun of the Taxation Department.

<h3>Incoming Article: China and the World Crisis (II)</h3>
<p>Lecture by Dr. Eddy, Recorded by Bingxun Speedwriting Company, Shen Wan Speedwriter</p>
<p>Now we can divide those in power into four types of people: (1) those who are conservative, in advantageous positions, and standing at a special stage; (2) free thinkers, who want to improve the existing system and create new systems; (3) radicals, who want to overthrow all old systems to create a new one; (4) reactionaries, who want to maintain their special interests and therefore want to overthrow the radicals. I was born into a wealthy family, but I am not conservative, because I am dissatisfied with the existing system. Later, I became a free thinker, wanting to improve it, but I felt it was still not enough, so I became a radical, wanting to create a new system. Now I am a socialist. I advocate building a new system without bloodshed. I will give an example: I live near a central station, which is a very large station with fifty tracks and many trains coming and going, with a million people passing through every day. Many things are transported by train. This old station is very small, very dark, and very dirty. If we want to build a new station, millions of people would be inconvenienced, and the station cannot be built in a short time. It would take at least one or two years to complete. So, we temporarily maintain the status quo, build twenty-five tracks underground, and build new buildings around the old station. When the new buildings are completed, we will tear down the old station. This way, traffic will not be disrupted at all, and the people will not feel inconvenienced. So, if we want to create a new China, we must use this method. Now we know that these people are dissatisfied with the old system or the existing government. I also have many dissatisfactions with the American government, but a country must have a government. So, first, there must be a government, and political laws must be orderly; (2) there must be a good government; (3) an autonomous government, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. This kind of government cannot be had immediately, just like rebuilding a central station, we must slowly use the old station as a new foundation. Do not do it like Soviet Russia, which lost a total of ten million lives during the war with the White Russians. I also do not want China to have another Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, and I do not want China to have frequent revolutions. Now there are two things we must strive for: (1) improve the existing system; (2) create a new system. In thirty years, I have come to China nine times. China's current hope is greater than before. Although there are many things that are wrong and unsatisfactory, China has a new hope. A few days ago, I looked down from the plane and saw places of light and darkness. We must find ways to improve the dark places. China has many talented people, a large labor force, with four million people, accounting for a quarter of the world's population. Farmers have a history of four thousand years, are most able to endure hardship, and have a special talent for competing with locals, which is not the case with the 和 and Filipinos. Moreover, the Chinese are one of the three major races. When Westerners in ancient times did not wear clothes, Chinese people wore silk clothes. When the West had no culture, the Chinese had already invented the compass, paper, gunpowder, printing, etc. China is not only an ancient nation, but also a new nation, and it is a powerful nation. The Red Indians of the Americas are gradually disappearing, but 80% of Chinese farmers are able to endure hardship. Although the Mongol and Manchu races once conquered China, where is their power now? Because China built a moral foundation in ancient times, the Mongol and Manchu races, although strong, could not destroy the Chinese nation. I feel that Chinese people have a very good moral foundation. Today we have great hope. We see that China's recent construction of roads in various provinces is more effective than in Soviet Russia. Some buildings in Nanjing are better than those in 　斯科. China's young politicians are full of hope and willing to improve the countryside. They regard rural construction as their sacred duty. There is also a New Life Movement, advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. This movement is a movement to build new morals, but it has not yet been fully successful. This movement promotes no longer exploiting the people and no longer taking advantage. China has a hopeful revelation, and China should build a new social order. Although China has hope, it also has dangers. Now China is suffering from international aggression. The four northeastern provinces have been lost, and North China is now in turmoil, filled with 乌烟瘴气. Japan is flooding North China with narcotic drugs such as heroin and morphine, like dark clouds in the sky. Now China must choose one of two paths: either like Poland, sinking into destruction, or like Denmark, saving itself. In the past, Poland had powerful enemies in the east, who seized the four eastern provinces, and the rest of the country was also in great danger. Their farmers were ignorant and uneducated, and their leaders were divided and fought each other, all with the aim of taking advantage. So, for one hundred and fifty years, there was no Poland on the map. If China continues to embrace this taking-advantage mentality, I am afraid that in one hundred and fifty years, there will be no China on the map either. We see that the destruction of Goryeo was also due to taking advantage. Provincial governors took advantage, the government took advantage, and the emperor exploited the people, so Goryeo was destroyed. Now the street names of Goryeo have been changed to Japanese names, and Japanese characters are being taught in Goryeo. So, the habit of taking advantage in China must be stopped. We hope that farmers will also receive proper education, just like in Denmark. At one time, Denmark was occupied by Germany. The fertile provinces in the south, its farmers, were ignorant, uneducated, and its leaders were divided, each doing their own thing, also taking advantage. Fortunately, two people later came out to save Denmark: one was a bishop, and the other was Mr. Yongde. What they did was: (1) awaken the people's patriotism; (2) revive education; (3) build rural areas, distribute land, so that 50% of the farmers have land to cultivate, lend money to farmers, and create cooperatives, better than Germany, Russia, and the United States; (4) use religion to improve national morals. Using the above four methods to change Denmark's bad system, other countries, such as England and Canada, have also implemented it. China can also implement it, and China can also recover the lost territories of the four northeastern provinces. Do we follow Poland or Denmark? To improve China, to unite China, just like Denmark. For this reason, I have returned to China again. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shandong Education Department Obeys Order to Resolve Qilu University President Issue</h3>
<p>▲Already issued instructions to Qilu University and a letter to the Board of Directors</p>
<p>丨If necessary, the competent educational authority may reorganize it丨</p>
<p>(Jinan Express News) Students from the liberal arts and science departments of Shandong Private Qilu University previously launched a movement due to the president issue and the issue of student roster filing, and students repeatedly went to the provincial government Education Department to petition and request four things (see separate article). The Education Department then submitted the students' petition and requests to the Ministry of Education for review. During this period, the students once suspended classes due to the Western board of directors overturning the resolution and suspecting the school authorities of various wrongdoings, awaiting the vote of the entire board of directors on the 5th of this month. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education sent a telegram to the Education Department, ordering it to quickly instruct the board of directors to resolve the president issue, and citing the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 2 of the revised Regulations for Private Schools: the board of directors' selection of the president must be approved by the competent educational administrative organ; if the president is incompetent, they may be ordered to select another; if the person selected is still incompetent, the competent educational authority may temporarily appoint someone; if the board of directors is in dispute, it may be ordered to reorganize within a time limit. The Education Department has notified Qilu University and the board of directors. The letters and telegrams are copied below:</p>
<p>▲Instructions to Qilu University: The Ministry of Education's telegram has been received, stating: "The Qilu University Board of Directors has scheduled a meeting on December 5th and should be ordered to quickly resolve the president issue to restore the school's operations. The provisions of Article 15, paragraph 2 of the revised Regulations for Private Schools should be noted and the meeting's progress reported." Upon investigation, the original text of Article 19, paragraph 2 of the revised Regulations for Private Schools states: "Regarding school administration, the president or dean is fully responsible for the selection by the board of directors. The board of directors shall not directly participate. The selected president or dean shall be subject to the approval of the competent educational administrative organ. The board of directors may at any time re-elect the president or dean who has neglected their duties. The competent educational administrative organ may also order the board of directors to re-elect the president or dean who is deemed incompetent by the educational administrative organ. If the re-election is still incompetent, the competent educational administrative organ may temporarily appoint someone. When the board of directors has a dispute that causes a standstill, the competent educational administrative organ may order it to reorganize within a time limit. If necessary, the competent educational administrative organ may reorganize it." It is hereby ordered that the university be informed and pay close attention to this matter. This order.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Qilu University Board of Directors: The students of the liberal arts and science departments of Private Qilu University previously petitioned the provincial government and this department multiple times due to the vacancy of the president and the lack of a person in charge, and suspended classes on the 26th of this month. All students went to the provincial government and this department twice to petition, submitting a petition with four requests: (1) Select a president; (2) Reorganize the board of directors; (3) Re-elect the dean of the medical school; (4) If the board of directors has the above intentions, it should report to the filing office three years in advance. They were told to return to school, resume classes, and await resolution. On the 24th, the director of this department personally went to the school to inspect it once. The next day after the suspension of classes, I returned to the school to convene teachers, staff, and student representatives to discuss the four opinions of the student representatives: (1) If the board of directors on December 5th has no results, who will be responsible for the recurrence of disputes? (2) If the board of directors cannot resolve the president issue and the student roster issue, please find a way to present it to the ministry. (3) The president selected by the board of directors must consider the demands of the students, that is, they must have the responsibility to develop the liberal arts and science departments and must not do anything detrimental to the liberal arts and science departments. (4) If students resume classes, they will rely on the government to obey government orders and resume classes. Please ask the director to maintain the school, except for the first item that is promised to be handled responsibly, and the fourth item is requested in person. The chairman of the board of directors, Vice Chairman Li, should cooperate with the staff and students to automatically resume classes. For the first item, because it is a dispute within the board of directors itself, if it cannot be resolved, the board of directors should be responsible. For the third item, sympathy is given in principle. The student side repeatedly stated that because they trust the government, they agree to resume classes immediately, but please the government side must do its best to urge the realization of its various requests. Upon investigation of this matter, Provincial Governor Han paid close attention to it and handed down the petition, ordering the department to quickly deal with it. The social aspect considers the school to be the highest institution of learning in this province and feels deeply serious about this matter. When your board of directors meets on December 5th, please pay special attention to the selection of the president and the student requests, and quickly resolve them. If the president issue still cannot be resolved at that time, and the school affairs are still not in charge, and thus another incident is brewed, the government side cannot be responsible.

<p>Chairman's Report: Director Pan, the chairman, first gave a report, stating that this year's natural disasters in various places are extremely serious, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the people's lives are difficult to maintain. Although Shanghai is affected by the economic downturn, it is still fortunate compared to the inland. Therefore, it is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai, regardless of all walks of life, should do their part to participate in the disaster relief donation campaign. Therefore, the mayor convened representatives from all walks of life to organize a general donation association, and decided to implement a general donation starting from the 8th. Before the 8th, all parties must have adequate preparations. The special invitation to all principals today is to discuss the fundraising methods of the education community, etc. Li Dachao then reported on the preparations for fundraising.</p>
<p>Principles Decided: The principals then discussed and decided on the following principles: (1) The Education Bureau will calculate the number of teachers and students in the city's large and medium-sized schools and send it to the General Office of the General Donation Association for the issuance of receipt books. (2) From the 5th to the 7th, each school should prepare a letter stamped with the school seal and send a person in charge to the General Office at the Sichuan Road YMCA to collect the receipt books.

The discussion ended at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Orders All Middle Schools to Improve Equipment</h3>
<p>▲Purchase funds must absolutely not be used for other purposes</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department, considering that various school equipment, such as books, instruments, samples, military training equipment, and sports equipment, are of great importance to school efficiency, in order to supervise and improve it, specifically ordered all secondary schools to comply with the expenses listed in the third item, "Purchase Funds," of each school's budget for this year, and to purchase equipment separately according to the actual needs of each school. Absolutely no funds should be diverted for other purposes. As for the names, quantities, and approximate prices of the purchased items, a list must be submitted one month in advance for inspection and acceptance by personnel.</p>
<h3>Gansu College President Deng Zheming Comes to Shanghai for Inspection</h3>
<p>Yesterday Visited Tongji and Fudan Universities</p>
<p>Deng Zheming, President of Gansu College, and Zhu Mingxin, Director of Affairs of the College, came to Shanghai from Gansu to inspect all the equipment of various universities. They have visited Tongji and Fudan Universities separately since yesterday. In order to understand the educational situation in Gansu Province, the reporter visited Deng at his residence yesterday. It happened that Deng was out. According to Zhu, Gansu Province is located in the Northwest, and various undertakings are inferior to those in the Southeast provinces. The province's education is of course not as good as Jiangsu Province. There are only more than 1,340 primary schools in the province, and there are more than 900,000 school-age children in the province. There are a total of 32 public and private middle schools with a total of more than 1,900 students. As for universities, there is only Gansu College, so Gansu College is the highest institution of learning in the Northwest. Only one college has been established in the five provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang. Now, in the midst of this construction of the Northwest, it is extremely important to improve the educational level of the Northwest. Zhu continued, the quantity of production in Gansu in recent years has improved compared with 1929, but it has not yet recovered to the situation before 1926.</p>
<h3>Shanghai East District Elementary School Principals' Association Holds Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>There are many schools in the Hudong (East Shanghai) district of this city, but unfortunately, there is a lack of unity on weekdays, resulting in scattered emotions and failure to seek improvement in teaching and learning. Now, the principals of the elementary schools there, Lei Zhenqing, Ye Renjie, Wu Yao, Chen Peiming, Qiu Zidong, Wang Jinyun, Weng Guodong, etc., in view of this, initiated the Hudong Elementary School Principals' Association. Yesterday (2nd) morning at 9:00 AM, the first preparatory meeting was convened at the Public Concession Huade Road Elementary School. More than 30 principals of elementary schools, including the Public Concession Huade Road, Nianhua, Jinghua, Huacheng Workers' Children, Huiqun, Dongminfu, Chongshi, etc., were present. Weng Guoxun was publicly elected as chairman, Chen Peiming as secretary, and rituals were performed.

<h3>Sichuan Generals Visit Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School</h3>
<p>A large number of Sichuan generals recently completed their training at the Huangshan Military Officer Training School and took a trip to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to inspect military affairs and visit educational institutions. They are currently staying at the New New East Asia Hotel and have been visiting the municipal government, various bureaus under the municipal government, and well-known schools in the city for several days. The generals paid special attention to the Jiangwan Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School. In recent years, the military and political authorities in Sichuan have vigorously promoted women's sports. Most of the physical education teachers and talents in Sichuan have been trained by Liangjiang. Therefore, in recent years, many students from Sichuan have gone to study at the school and are very enthusiastic. Yesterday, Ye Yuxin, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Army, Liu Zhucun, Brigade Commander of the 24th Army, Deng Mingshu, Fu Yuanxi, Tu Zhiming, and Yu Ruhai, Commander-in-Chief of Sichuan and Kang, visited the school together. Principal Lu Lihua personally received them and inspected the school for a week. The generals praised the school's facilities, extolling the spaciousness of the venue, the freshness of the air, and the beauty of the urban and rural areas. They also inquired in detail about the lives of Sichuan students and gave many words of encouragement. The generals believe that the school's basketball team is famous overseas in the East and Japan, and they intend to invite Principal Lu to send the team to Sichuan to awaken the women of Sichuan and spread the culture within the territory. Principal Lu is also willing to discuss the matter further in order to realize it.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Students from Jiangxi Province Request Supplementary Scholarships</h3>
<p>▲Fifty students from the History and Geography Department depart for investigation</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education previously issued scholarships for 50 students in domestic universities from Jiangxi Province in order to encourage them to study hard. However, the students from Jiangxi Province at National Jinan University were not included in the list. Outsiders do not understand the reason and are quite suspicious. It has been learned that the reason for this is due to a misunderstanding. The investigation form was submitted slightly late, which led to the omission. It is now heard that the school authorities have applied to the Education Department for supplementary issuance, so that they can be treated the same as students from Jiangxi Province at other universities, so as to avoid being disappointed.</p>
<p>The Department of History and Geography of National Jinan University has been established for two years with remarkable achievements. Now, the graduation investigation group plans to publicly explore the Hangzhou-Jiangxi Railway during the day, and conduct field investigations, with a variety of forms and measuring instruments, and the research objects will mainly be the topography, water system, transportation, special products, population, and residents of the line. Professor Sheng Xugong of the department will be invited to lead the team. This trip will be able to return to the school only after both internal and external contacts. At that time, there will be a contribution.</p>

<h3>Jiang Yuanxin Returns to China After Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>▲Gained more insights into cooperative undertakings</p>
<p>Jiang Yuanxin, courtesy name Zuomin, is from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. In the summer of 1925, he graduated from the Department of Economics of National Peking University. He immediately went south to participate in the National Revolution. During the Northern Expedition, he served in the General Political Department and once served as the director of the division's political department. In 1927-28, he served as a member of the executive committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters. In the autumn of 1929, he was the secretary of the Finance Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and concurrently the head of the First Section. He had detailed planning for the province's finances and made many achievements. In particular, the rectification of miscellaneous taxes, such as the unified tax, license tax, and brokerage tax at that time, all increased revenue sharply due to the elimination of embezzlement, which was an unprecedented initiative in the history of Zhejiang's finances. The Zhejiang Provincial Government praised his ability and sent him to the United States and other countries to study finance in order to deepen his knowledge. He went abroad in the summer of 1931, first to the United States, then to countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Denmark, and Italy. He carefully inspected everything he went to, without leaving any concerns, and gained the most from rural economics and cooperative undertakings. Therefore, domestic comrades urged him to return as soon as possible so that he could contribute to China's social construction. Jiang also believed that the investigation of several years could come to an end, so he took the Conte Rosso ship from Italy and returned to China, arriving in Shanghai late last night. At one time, there were many people who knew him from various places and went to the wharf to welcome him.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Basketball: Jinan Defeats Nanxing</h3>

<p>There were two A-group basketball matches of Western Youth yesterday evening: (1) Chizhi defeated Qingguang, with a final score of 45 to 33; (2) Jinan defeated Nanxing, with a final score of 53 to 25. The match details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Chizhi Defeats Qingguang: Qingguang has been lacking talent recently, with dwindling team members and a dispirited situation. Although Wu Shengwu, Dong Xiaopei, and others are maintaining appearances, they are past their prime and their heroic spirit is gone. Therefore, they were defeated by Chizhi yesterday. Although Chizhi's basketball skills are mediocre, their shooting accuracy is quite good, which is a major reason for their victory.</p>
<p>▲Chizhi Throw Free Foul Score ▲Qingguang Throw Free Foul Score</p>
<p>Lin Qiming 1 0 0 2 Dong Xiaopei 0 1 1 1</p>

<p>Second Half: Chizhi 19, Qingguang 15</p>
<p>▲Jinan Defeats Nanxing: Within the first ten minutes after the start of the match, Jinan showed signs of unfamiliar coordination, resulting in a blurred frontline. Under Nanxing's fierce attack, Jinan's momentum was extremely weak. Later, Jinan realized the need to work hard, and the situation turned around, emerging from a score of 9 to 15 to take the lead with 21 to 15 in the first half. In the second half, Jinan was effortless and sharp, fully displaying their abilities. As the saying goes, "Only a long journey reveals a horse's strength." Nanxing was exhausted and eventually defeated.</p>

<h3>Changshu Climbing Competition: Zhang Yiwei Reaches Yushan Peak First</h3>
<p>▲ Female Student Zhao Yuqin Also Reaches the Finish Line</p>
<p>(Changshu Correspondence) In order to promote public sports, the Public Sports Field of this county has specially organized a climbing competition, with the Zushi Fushui Rock, the highest peak of Yushan, as the destination. The total height is 106 zhang (old chi), and the route starts from the old county field in the city, passes through Daonan Street, then through County West Street, Nanshi Center, Siqian Main Street, Zhao Alley, Huai Liu Lane, West Alley, North Gate Main Street, out of the North Gate, climbs up from Taojian, through Shiwujian, Weimo Pine Forest, Dou Niu Station, and reaches the entrance of the Zushi Temple at Fushui Rock as the finish line. The total length of the route is 5,575 meters, which is less than 10,000 meters, but it is indeed strenuous due to the mountain climbing. The Sports Field has been preparing for a month before everything was ready. The competition was held at 9:30 AM on the 2nd of this month, with a total of 100 participants, including one female, Zhao Yuqin, who bravely participated and attracted much attention from all walks of life. Therefore, in addition to the Education Bureau, the county magistrate, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and major businesses have donated more than 70 prizes. This time, not only students participated, but also rickshaw pullers, police officers, shop assistants, fire brigade members, and civil servants, which was quite enthusiastic and the interest was very strong. When the competition was held that morning, the streets along the route were blocked, which was unprecedented. Fortunately, all the police officers of the Public Security Bureau and the Boy Scouts of the 277th Regiment of the county high school maintained order along the way. When departing, 92 people actually reported, and 8 were absent. A total of 83 people were able to reach the finish line, which was a very good result. Zhang Yiwei took the lead from the very beginning, leading the way. Police officers Bian Zhiming, Xu Zhaoqi, and Lu Zugen also followed closely, never leaving his side. When passing the North Gate, Bian Zhiming once took the lead. Xu Zhaoqi was small and lively, but gradually fell behind due to his physical condition. When Zhang Yiwei reached the Tao Yuan Ravine, he suddenly used a trick to call out to Bian Zhiming, who was in front, saying that the journey ahead was still long and that he should proceed slowly, fearing that he would run out of energy in the end. Bian was eventually fooled by Zhang and proceeded shoulder to shoulder. When they reached Weimo and passed the pine forest, which was flat ground, Zhang immediately broke free and ran forward, and Bian was eventually abandoned. Therefore, Zhang Yiwei won the first place with a time of 29 minutes and 10 seconds. The second place was Chen Zancheng, who was about 30 to 40 meters away from the first one, with a time of 29 minutes, 21 seconds, and 3/5. The time was measured very accurately this time, because the mountaintop was equipped with a telephone for air defense, and the Security Team Leader was specially consulted to connect the telephone with the telephone at the issuing point. When the order was given to fire the gun, the gunshot could also be heard on the mountain telephone. The names and times of the top 15 are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Yiwei, 29 minutes and 10 seconds; (2) Chen Zancheng, 29 minutes and 21.6 seconds; (3) Jin Genyuan, 29 minutes and 40 seconds; (4) Bian Zhiming, 30 minutes and 5 seconds; (5) Ma Haoqing, 30 minutes and 30 seconds; (6) Zhai Zhiping, 30 minutes and 55 seconds; (7) Tao Hongjun, 31 minutes and 11 seconds; (8) Xu Zhaoqi, 31 minutes and 12 seconds; (9) Jiang Yousi, 31 minutes and 12.4 seconds; (10) Gui Cheng, 31 minutes and 47 seconds; (11) Xie Hongfa, 31 minutes and 47.8 seconds; (12) Jiang Huaizu, 31 minutes and 50 seconds; (13) Lu Zugen, 32 minutes and 9 seconds; (14) Shen Shengsheng, 32 minutes and 14 seconds; (15) Ni Xisheng, 32 minutes and 14 seconds. The Sports Field has selected a total of 30 people, each receiving a silver cup and miscellaneous items. Although the female Zhao Qin was not selected, she received a gift for her promotion. Also, special prizes were given to the youngest Xu Zhaoqi (12 years old) and the oldest Wang Guoliang (41 years old).</p>
<h3>Huaguang and Baihong Track and Field Competition Cancelled</h3>
<p>The Huaguang and Baihong track and field friendly competition, originally scheduled to be held on the 9th, has reportedly been cancelled due to certain reasons on the Baihong side that prevent them from fulfilling their wishes. According to the person in charge of Huaguang, in order to enhance their strength, the team has now sent a challenge to the Japanese bridge team. If the negotiation goes smoothly, it may be implemented this Sunday.</p>

<p>Little West Heaven</p>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Laughing and Fawning, Raising Lanterns to Illuminate Careworn Faces, Driven by Empty Stomachs, Learning to Be Sophisticated with Makeup</p>
<p>Yueying, who was in the same predicament, laughed: Auntie is getting flustered. Didn't you roll up your clothes and use them as a pillow? Mrs. Hu exclaimed and scrambled to put on her clothes. While buttoning, she fumbled to open the front door. In the darkness, she saw a figure standing abruptly at the door. Even though she knew it was Little Ji, her heart was pounding a bit, and she took two steps back. Little Ji said: Is that Mrs. Hu? Mrs. Hu said: What's the rush, coming to find me in the dark? Little Ji said: I've spoken to that Master Jia, and we've arranged for you to bring someone to talk to him tomorrow morning. Mrs. Hu said: Did he say he'd give me a dollar? Little Ji said: That was just something I said to trick you into getting up. Mrs. Hu spat and tried to shut the door. Little Ji said: You must go. The dollar has already been given to me. Mrs. Hu said: Really? Give me the money. Little Ji hesitated for a moment and laughed: You don't trust me, and I don't trust you either. You go with someone tomorrow morning, and I'll naturally give it to you. Having said that, Little Ji turned and left. In his heart, he thought: A fisherman has to use some bait, and a chicken thief has to scatter some grain. So, he'll just spend a dollar. Since he's willing to spend a dollar, he doesn't have to worry about Mrs. Hu not coming. Little Ji returned to Little West Heaven with great confidence, preparing some things for the next day. Sure enough, at a little after six o'clock the next morning, Mrs. Hu brought Yueying quietly to the outside of Little Ji's room, first coughing softly twice. Little Ji was sitting in the room smoking paper cigarettes, looking at the ceiling and thinking about something. He clearly heard it but ignored it. Mrs. Hu had no choice but to hold onto the door and stick her head in, laughing: Brother Ji is in the room, why aren't you paying attention to me? Little Ji laughed: I can't see through walls. If you don't call me from outside, how would I know you've come? She held onto the door and walked in, whispering: Didn't you tell me to come in the morning? I'm here now. Little Ji said: Where's the girl? (80)</p>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>— Ji Chengxing</p>
<p>In this society where morality is declining and people's hearts are deteriorating, trying to find a few friends who share joys and sorrows with you is a difficult task. But trying to make friends who are only there for the good times is as easy as finding a needle in a haystack!</p>
<p>People nowadays value power and influence over friendship and loyalty because power and influence benefit them and give them opportunities to climb the social ladder. Perhaps everyone is used to seeing Old Zhang get lucky and become a high-ranking official, so Old Zhang's friends can find shelter under his big tree! Old Li made a fortune, and many friends chase after Old Li, waiting for his commands!</p>
<p>A person who is down on their luck is like a stinking crow, not even ants will come to smell it. I have never heard of a fallen nobleman being loved by a young woman, nor have I heard of a poor man being favored by a rich person. But I have heard of friendships breaking down because of a loss of financial control, and I have also heard of many people arguing over the amount of gifts their friends give them. They don't know what Fuller said: "Don't use gifts to make friends. When you stop giving, they will abandon you." Truly, people who alleviate the burdens of others in this world are rare, even if there are, they are like flowers in the desert!</p>
<p>"If there are no friends, it's truly lonely. The light of friendship is warm, without it, the end of humanity seems near!" I often think like this.</p>
<p>"Even if that person has committed a crime of theft, as long as he has a precious friendship with his friends, he is still kind and approachable!" One of my friends said.</p>
<p>Do humans really not need friends? If they don't, then please read this famous quote from Stevenson: "One day we love another, we should serve that person for one day. One day we are loved by another, I dare say we are indispensable for one day. One who still has a friend is not a useless waste."</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Cang)</p>
<p>▲It is right to say that books are the food of the spirit, then bad books are the poison of the spirit.</p>
<p>▲Thought is like barren land. Without cultivation and nurturing, it will never bloom with brilliant flowers.</p>
<h3>Miss Zhang</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yongmei</p>
<p>I am quite fortunate to have been neighbors with Miss Zhang for a year and six months. According to Mrs. Liu, the neighbor, when Miss Zhang moved here, she was still wearing blue bamboo cloth clothes and cloth-soled shoes. Over the years, her attitude has changed greatly!</p>
<p>Indeed, Miss Zhang is beautiful now. She has curly, fine hair, large, dark eyes, a delicate face like powder, and cherry lips like blood. Adding high-heeled shoes and a long cheongsam, she appears extraordinarily beautiful. In short, she has all the modern decorations of a modern woman. It would be a great injustice to say that she is not the standard beauty of East Asia.</p>
<p>Movies seem to be her destiny from a previous life. When "Song of the Fishermen" was screened for sixty consecutive days, she was like "Song of the Fishermen," never missing a session. When she came back after watching the movie, she praised the male movie stars as having artistic talent, but as for the female stars, she really didn't think much of them. If you chime in and say, "Miss Zhang, you are the best woman in the world!" Then she would smile sweetly and happily brew the finest and most fragrant tea buds for you.</p>
<p>Of course, Miss Zhang is educated. Singing and dancing are her specialties. After dinner or late at night, you can hear her singing the most popular song "Peach Blossom River is a Den of Beauties." Hearing this clear and beautiful song in boredom, I rejoice that my ears are so lucky.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang is a great talker. Whether it's the smallest fly or the vastness of the universe, once it's on her lips, she can explain it logically. It's a pity she's not a lawyer. If she were, I think she would be several times more popular than Zheng Yuxiu.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang doesn't care about spending money. She often says: What's so special about money? She spends an unknown amount on silk stockings and cosmetics every month. However, Miss Zhang's family is quite poor.</p>
<h3>Not to Slacken the Slightest</h3>
<h3>Fragrant Misty Records of the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Ah! How handsome and magnificent he is!"</p>
<p>"With such a dignified and noble demeanor, he is worthy of being the monarch of a great country!"</p>
<p>After seeing this portrait, everyone couldn't help but admire it in secret. I think if the artist of this portrait did not specially enhance and embellish him because he was an emperor, then Qianlong's appearance can be said to be handsome and heroic, rarely seen in the world! But according to the words and deeds of this wise ruler recorded in official history and private biographies, we can easily believe that the portrait did not go beyond the scope of reality.</p>
<p>Qianlong in the painting is in the scene of hunting, riding a snow-white horse under his crotch, its spiritedness and magnificence, just enough to match its master's appearance. On the back of the horse, as usual, there is a saddle; this saddle is purely Mongolian style, with countless jewels inlaid on it. The two stirrups are all gold, shining brightly in the painting. Qianlong sits like a small mountain on this extremely luxurious saddle. Looking at him, he is also wearing a full hunting suit, covered with a apricot-yellow tight-fitting vest. A wide satin belt is tied around his waist, also yellow, with many beads nailed on it. His soft helmet is even more unique. The helmet itself is a pointed hat, but there are two ears hanging down on both sides, connected under the jaw, much like the format of the leather hats worn by airplane pilots today. The material of this hat is yellow satin, with a long and beautiful red tassel on top, all the way down to the edge of the hat. (190)</p>
<h3>Nursery</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Social welfare undertakings seem to have not yet been fully developed in China, so some have not yet been held, such as nurseries. In Soviet Russia, they are run strictly and well, but in China, the achievements have not yet made special contributions.</p>
<p>Recently, many enthusiastic social workers have paid considerable attention to it, and promotions in newspapers are often seen in writings. What is especially worthy of attention is that the Mandarin sound film "Mrs. Mai" is being staged at Xinguang these days. Although the story is concentrated on drama, the beginning of that bizarre story to the end of the ending, the cause of a storm, is entirely because of raising funds for the nursery, launching a recreation party, and causing a family comedy between a certain wife.</p>
<p>Promoting the holding of nurseries, especially being able to use it in movies, the harvested effect is expected to be great. I hope everyone will pay great attention to it. At the same time, I hope the producers can be more cautious in their attitude. (Gratitude)</p>
<p>Local Customs Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Examination of Kang Senghui's Dwelling in Longhua</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Communication Agency</p>
<p>The pagoda in front of today's Longhua Temple in Shanghai is said to have been built in the tenth year of Wu Yiwu. However, it is said that this is the case, but there is no definite evidence. Now there is a Dragon Flower Relic Record stele under the pagoda, which briefly says:</p>
<p>At that time, I heard that Kang Senghui was of high moral character and passed through Longhua Tang. The dragon gave way to his residence and built a thatched hut for self-cultivation. King (Sun Quan) recognized the monk and met him, and persuaded him to worship Buddhism. ······The King ordered the construction of thirteen pagodas, Longhua being one of them.</p>
<p>Although it clearly states that Kang Senghui once lived in Longhua, this pagoda was built to commemorate the place where he lived; however, this statement is also unknown and cannot be believed.</p>
<p>Now, reading Kang Senghui's biography from the Buddhist scriptures, it briefly says:</p>
<p>Kang Senghui, his ancestor was from Kangju. He lived in Tianzhu for generations. His father moved to Jiaozhi because of business. When he was over ten years old, his parents both died, and he became a monk. At that time, Sun Quan had already controlled Jiangzuo, but Buddhism had not yet been practiced. So he traveled east with his staff and reached Jianye in the tenth year of Chiwu, where he built a thatched hut and set up images to practice Taoism. Quan summoned and said to him: "If you can obtain relics, I will build a pagoda for you." He fasted and respectfully requested, and indeed obtained relics. Quan was greatly surprised and convinced, and built a pagoda for him immediately. Because there was a Buddhist temple for the first time, it was named Jianchu Temple. Its place was named Buddhato-ri. He translated many scriptures at Jianchu Temple. He died in April of the first year of Taikang of Jin.</p>
<p>According to the biography, he came to Jianye (now Nanjing) from Jiaozhi (now northern Annam), and there is no doubt that he came east by sea. Then, he may have landed at a seaport near Shanghai today and built a thatched hut in Longhua. The biography says, "He reached Jianye in the tenth year of Chiwu and built a thatched hut and set up images to practice Taoism." At first glance, it seems that he built a thatched hut in Jianye. In fact, reaching Jianye is one thing, and building a thatched hut and setting up images to practice Taoism is another thing. The biography does not clearly state where the thatched hut was built. Because Shanghai was remote at that time and had no place name, it was not mentioned in detail. However, since today's Shanghai is within the scope of the so-called Jiangzuo, how can we know that the thatched hut was not built in Shanghai!</p>
<p>The names Jianchu Temple, Buddhato-ri, etc. cannot be verified in later generations. Let's leave it blank for now. However, since he came to Jianye from Jiaozhi by sea, it seems possible to say that he landed at a seaport near Shanghai today; it was reasonable to build a pagoda at that time as a memorial.</p>
<p>I secretly think that the pagoda built at the beginning must have been extremely simple, so it was not seen in the records and poems of previous people. As far as my knowledge is concerned, the earliest poem about Longhua is Rimei's poem about passing through Longhua at the end of the Tang Dynasty. The poem says:</p>
<p>The ancient temple still exists in the city today, and people walk on the frosty grass bridge. I still hate the dim moon for its dim light, and I can't see the reflection of the pagoda in the heart of the wave.</p>
<p>Carefully examining the meaning of the first sentence, the temple had already been destroyed at this time (note, the temple and the pagoda were not built at the same time), so it is said that "the name of the ancient temple still exists." As for the sentence "I can't see the reflection of the pagoda in the heart of the wave," it seems to refer to the absence of the moon, and has nothing to do with the existence or abolition of the pagoda, but the meaning is also very vague.</p>
<p>Now, checking the old records about the rise and fall of the pagoda, many details are also unknown before the Song Dynasty. After the reconstruction in the second year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty, there were clear records. As for the pagoda seen today, it has been rebuilt many times. However, based on the path of Kang Senghui's eastward journey, it can be said that the trace of his footsteps once reached a sea, and the beginning of the pagoda's creation was built to commemorate the place where he lived, which can also be a saying.</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver Financials Rise, Exchange Rate Shrinks</h3>
<h3>Gold Price Recovers by 1.7 Yuan</h3>
<p>=Indian Silver Continues Telegraphic Rise=</p>
<p>=Gold Price Fails to Rise as Desired=</p>
<p>Although the gold market showed a recovery yesterday, the overall trend remained similar to last weekend. Market conditions were mediocre, the trend sluggish, and the balance tax rose by half a cent, briefly stirring buying interest. However, the exchange market eased, eventually calming down. In the morning, the overseas silver market showed stability in both London and New York, the forward silver market slightly contracted, and the exchange rate remained downstream. London spot gold rose by one penny, and off-site pre-market trading opened, rising to 991.2 yuan. Some sold at the high, and then it went downstream again. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the US dollar down by 0.0625. Customs gold rose by one li, and the standard gold price was 1006.6 yuan. The morning opening was slightly higher than last Saturday's close. Tianfeng aggressively advanced, but the banks' appetite varied after the opening. Although buyers surged, the domestic market remained mediocre, showing signs of easing, and falling after rising. Major players jointly supplied, once breaking the 90 yuan mark, but it was quickly pulled up. The Central Bank bought more than 100,000 yuan of US dollars for January, allowing the market to maintain and gradually rise again. When the silver balance tax was announced, rising to 6.75%, calculated at one shilling five pence 65625 for the British pound, confidence rose, and the gold price subsequently increased. However, due to the continued easing of the shilling, a decline was inevitable. Nevertheless, because of the improved sentiment, it was able to rise higher again. Banks took the opportunity to sell expensively, gradually moving downstream. The exchange market resumed its easing trend, and thereafter, sentiment was uncertain. Sellers acted boldly, and with the Central Bank and China supplying US dollars, the market price fell again. However, after a low close at noon, it still rose and hovered, with a hidden steady trend. In the afternoon market, the exchange market stabilized, and on-site trading also sought mediocre supply and demand, resulting in an extremely flat situation. Later, as banks continued to fill shillings, the exchange market remained firm, and the gold price went from high to low. After the fall, buyers were eager, and it remained stable. However, the Bombay silver market reported consecutive rises twice, totaling 4.4.3 annas, making it difficult to rise. On-site transactions were limited, thereafter hovering around 3 yuan, with no special changes, barely managing to close the day.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 990.7 yuan, slightly higher by one jiao compared to last Saturday's noon close. Huaci filled December shillings at 3125, but because Hengyu, Tongchun, Fuyu, Qingyu, and Zhaofengchangjin raised their prices to 2.9 jiao, Fuxingyong, Dada, Decheng, Hengxing, Yuanxiang, Fengyu, Xinxing, Fuyu, Hengyu, and Zhaofengchang sold off, and Pan'gen sold current shillings at 375 to Mitsui, and retreated to 89.7 yuan. The Central Bank bought US dollars for January at 5625, and sentiment remained stable. Fuxingyong first sold and then bought, and Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Yicheng, Fuchang, Yifeng, Yongtianfeng, Yuanchang, Yongda, Decheng, etc. jointly increased their orders. The silver balance tax was announced, rising to 6.75%, with the British pound calculated at one shilling five pence 65625, confidence rose, and gradually rose to 96 yuan. However, because current shillings at 375 and 3125 were matched, there was still a lack of buyers, and there were still sources of supply taking advantage of the high price. Changda, Fuyu, Dachangxiang, Yicheng, and Hengtai sold off, retreating to 4 yuan. Yongfengyuan, Kangxiang, Fuchang, Hengyu, Wanxing, etc. were still eager to accept orders, and it rose again to 7 yuan. Mackellar filled January shillings at 125, and Citibank filled January US dollars at half a yuan and then declined again. Fuan, Senchang, Yonghengfengyuan, Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang sold off, retreating to 4 yuan. Futaiheng Dada and Decheng took advantage of the low price to accept orders, rising to 5.2 jiao. Great Britain came out with April shillings at 9375, Fuan and Qianchangxiang sold off, and still tended to go downstream. Dada and Fuxingyong sold again, China sold US dollars for February at 4375 to Huabi, and retreated to 1.2 jiao. Qingyu and Hengyu accepted orders, Mackellar bought US dollars for January at 6875, the situation was still stable, and rose to 2.7 jiao. After fluctuating, the noon close was 991.7 yuan. After the close, it was relatively stable.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 993.6 yuan. Citibank came out with US dollars for January at 625, Yuanmaoyongyuanyi sold, retreating to 2.8 jiao, but Mackellar bought current US dollars at 34 yuan, and sentiment remained stable. Hengyu and Dada accepted orders and rose, Dada, Fuan, and Qingyu even rose to 4.8 jiao. Hengyu, Yuanyitong, and Xinyong sold off, gradually falling to within 4 yuan. Huabi came out with shillings for February at 125, Qianchangxiang and Yongli even sold to 1.9 jiao. Hengxing, Dingkang, Qingyu, and Tianfengyong accepted orders, but lacked transactions, and gradually rose again to 3.2 jiao. Bombay initially rose 3.2.1 annas, Fuxingyong and Dachangxiang came to sell, retreating to 2.1 jiao, but Hongxing, Yuanmaoyong, Zhengchang, etc. took advantage of the low price to buy, and gradually recovered. At this time, because Dafa Yongda and Lianbang slightly sold, it was still hovering, and eventually retail investors vigorously raised it, once rising to 3.1 jiao. Bombay rose again by 12.2 annas, making it difficult to rise further, and it began to hover. Tianfeng, Yuanmaoyong, and Fuxingyong came to supply orders, and the close retreated again to 992.3 yuan. After the close, Fuxingyong and Tongtaichang slightly accepted orders, and rose to around 3 yuan. It was found that the highest price of the day was 997 yuan, and the lowest price was 989.7 yuan, a fluctuation of 7.3 yuan. As a result, it recovered by 1.7 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 1006.6 yuan based on the Central Bank's standard gold price for licensed holders, approximately 14 yuan lower based on the closing price, 1 yuan less than last Saturday. The bookkeeping price for this month was 983 yuan, and for January it was 992 yuan. The morning water supplement was 983 yuan, and the afternoon water supplement was the same price. Refined gold was still 2 yuan lower than the standard gold, with a listed price of 988.7 yuan. The foreign discount had decreased, and the spot situation continued to be active. Although there was a lack of substantial transactions, the on-site water addition was more expensive, with Tianjin goods adding approximately 3 yuan. However, the market was still quiet, and the swap was even quieter, because there were very few remaining orders, and the time limit was still far away. Credit conditions were loose, so both long and short sides lacked interest. For December orders, if public orders are excluded, only 35 orders remain.</p>
<p>On-site trading was extremely quiet, and the afternoon market was even more idle. In total, Tianfeng, Yongfeng, Zhaofengchang, Yuanmaoyong, Fuchang, Futaiheng, Zhengchang, Yuanchang, Yongtongfu, etc. were on the buying side, while Dada, Decheng, Qianchangxiang, Wanxing, Shunli, Dafa, Yongfuxingyong, Tongchun, Yuqing, Yonghengchang, Yongjiarun, Juchang, Yongli, and Dingtai Yuanyi Yicheng, etc. were on the selling side. Tongchunfuyu, Tianfenghengyu first advanced and then retreated, Tongtaichang Yifengyongfuan Dada and Decheng Hongxing first sold and then bought. Dalianbang Wanxing jointly traded more than 1,100 orders, netting out just over 300. Shunli jointly traded more than 600 orders, netting out just over 300 orders. The trading of Guangbang Shenghong and Hengxing was still small. The total number of transactions that day was 37,793 orders in the morning and 11,361 orders in the afternoon, with a total of 28,924 orders for January. There were a total of 67 long parties and 51 short parties.</p>
<p>Only seven public orders were received and resolved that day, with seven orders resolved by the short side and received by Futaiheng on the long side. The settlement price was 983 yuan.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Initially Tight, Then Loose</h3>
<p>=Forward Results Still Flat=</p>
<p>=Spot Market Even Looser and More Abundant=</p>
<p>According to foreign news reports yesterday, London large orders were flat for both near and far terms, New York silver prices remained unchanged, Monde's forward silver prices contracted by five haos, London spot gold rose by one penny, British pound against the US dollar contracted by half a point, British pound against the French franc fell by thirteen pounds, US dollar against the British pound contracted by seventy-five, British pound against the US dollar contracted by 125.

The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the US dollar down by 0.0625. Customs gold units rose by one li. Although it eased after the opening, it was still able to recover slightly. The banks' appetite for purchase and sale varied. Market conditions were mediocre. HSBC's listed prices were also unchanged for the British pound and down by 0.0625 for the US dollar. This was due to the continuous decline in the exchange rate in recent days, with little stimulation. The Central Bank bought and settled more than 100,000 US dollars, and the process was even more mediocre. When the silver balance tax was announced, rising by half a point, confidence rose, and it tended to tighten. Banks took the opportunity to sell expensively, tightening and then easing. Later, the Central Bank and China also came to sell. Banks still bought on the cheap. At noon, the situation was flat again. In the afternoon market, although banks were selling, the situation was still flat. In addition, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to settle spot transactions, and the underlying trend seemed slightly tighter. Before long, banks resumed selling shillings, and the process remained firm. Although there were few transactions later, because Indian silver had risen twice in a row, totaling 4.4.3 annas, banks were hedging against each other, and the exchange rate was quite loose. The spot and futures markets became even more distant. The closing selling price was one shilling four pence 4375 for the British pound, and 34.0625 yuan for the US dollar, with the British pound looser by 125 and the US dollar firmer by 1875 compared to last Saturday. Spot Chinese merchants lacked special appetite, and after hedging, they were only buying and selling variably, slightly on the buying side. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>
<p>In the morning, the selling price for near-term British pounds opened at one shilling four pence 25. The Zhengjin Bank sold and Huabi bought December at 3125.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<h3>Securities Where Ups and Downs Are Not Easy</h3>
<h3>Yesterday's Market First Rose, Then Declined Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the Chinese Securities Exchange had a holiday on Sunday, its volatility was still extremely dramatic. The entire day was turbulent and unpredictable. At the opening of the morning, continuing the remaining momentum of the previous day, market prices continued to advance. The short covering on the 16th had not waned for a long time, and with the easing of foreign call loans, there was no shortage of new longs in the forward market. Market prices rose slowly. In the first session, all rose by three to five jiao. In the second session, the rising momentum of the front row did not weaken, and all groups had offsetting positions. Market prices continued to rise. Later, due to the frequent selling of the 4th, the rising momentum temporarily declined, and market conditions slightly hovered. At the opening of the afternoon market, market sentiment was sluggish, and the 4th and others continued to sell, resulting in a slight decline. At the close, rumors suddenly spread in the market that the environment had fluctuated again. Although it was not clear whether the matter was true or false, people's hearts had been shaken. Longs exited one after another, and retail investors sold accordingly. A falling wind suddenly arose, becoming stronger later, falling by one or two jiao to more than half a yuan. Looking at the overall trend, both long and short sides seemed to be judging each other, waiting for an opportunity to move. Generally, it can be seen that the market has undergone repeated changes. The near and far-term market prices are so close to each other that they cannot trigger arbitrage transactions. From this, it can be seen that although credit is clearly loose, it is actually tight, and market prices are difficult to rise sharply for a while, but they will not fall sharply either. It is not easy to go long, and it is difficult to go short. For the time being, it should tend towards a hovering situation. Yesterday's market results showed mixed ups and downs. The rumor of 96 was invisibly eliminated, and market prices recovered by one or two jiao. The total transaction volume was 18,645,000. The comparison table of its ups and downs is listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>Marked Yarn Longs Take Profits</h3>
<h3>Rumors of Japanese Merchants Dumping More</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned weak, and the continued rise caused some profit-takers to close out positions, and there were rumors that Japanese merchants were dumping more, and sentiment was flat. However, the yarn received by Tongcheng Company was still not released, so the buying interest in the forward market was still strong.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Falls Back by Four, Five, Six Jiao</h3>
<p>The bidding yarn market opened in the morning, and the situation was quite strong, and the bidding was getting tighter and tighter, because there were rumors in the market that the yarn factory had stopped night work, so the distant months broke through 90 yuan. Unexpectedly, when the bidding reached the second and third sessions, Gengfenghao continued to dump, and the market suddenly fell, resulting in a fall of one, two, and four jiao in each month. The market momentum was still weak in the afternoon, and the popularity turned depressed, and each month fell again by one, three, four, and six jiao. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 36,600 bales.

<h3>Rumors of Tianjin Cotton Coming to Shanghai for Delivery, Future Cotton Sales Suddenly Become Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton market continued to be weak, and the falling trend was quite rapid, because rumors arose in the market that the yarn factory had stopped night work. Another message was that Tianjin coarse cotton will come to Shanghai for delivery, so people's hearts suddenly changed, and the distant months all fell within the 38 yuan level. The demand for spot cotton in the market was stagnant due to high prices.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Falls by Half a Yuan Bidding cotton opened in the morning, and the market sentiment was depressed. There were not many buyers in the field, and it was rumored that the yarn factory had stopped work, so the pace of opening was soft, resulting in a fall of one, two, and three jiao in each month. The market situation became more and more panicked in the afternoon bidding, because there were rumors that coarse cotton from Tianjin would come to Shanghai for delivery, so sellers suddenly became enthusiastic, resulting in a fall of three jiao to three and a half jiao in each month. The distant months broke through the 38 yuan mark. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 130,700 dan. It was found that Yuanxingchang sold 4,300 dan, Xincheng 1,100 dan, Xinhua 2,300 dan, Changhe 12,100 dan, Hengchang 1,900 dan, Runkang 6,100 dan, Shenchang 2,300 dan, Gengfeng 2,600 dan, Hengyi 4,500 dan, Changji 1,300 dan, and Daji 2,200 dan.

<p>Total 816,400</p>
<p>The demand for raw cotton by factories is weak, and the sales of spot cotton are becoming more and more silent. The factory appetite is quite sluggish. The sources are estimated to be 1,260 bales of Tonghua and 945 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 45.00 Shenxin Factory Imported 100 pieces Spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Lint 46.00 Yufeng Factory Imported 200 pieces Spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Delivered That Is Higher Than the Stored Sample Is Also Allowed to Be Delivered</h3>
<p>The city's yarn and cloth exchange market announced that the standard products or substitutes provided for delivery by cotton yarn trading brokers should be consistent with the stored samples of the exchange before they can be allowed to be delivered. Now, it is reported that various substitutes listed in the exchange's cotton yarn grade table, when sold in the market, have different packaging than before. For example, there are those who have changed the smooth 16-count yarn to 16.5-count, and there are also those who have changed it to 17-count, and are marked on the package. When this substitute is provided for delivery, if the goods are confirmed by the exchange to be consistent with the stored samples, only the packaging is slightly different, and the difference is indeed higher than the stored samples, it can also be allowed to be delivered, and the receiving broker shall not object. It has been decided by the board of directors in accordance with the provisions of Article 169 of the business rules.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Private Estimates Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>New York Telegram, 1st. The Khu-Khwaik Company's estimate for the current new cotton crop is 9,696,000 bales, with 9,112,000 bales already ginned. The previous estimate (October 31st) was 9,617,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Grain Futures Rise Initially, Then Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market started steady and then declined. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago, rose about 45 cents, Canada rose 234 cents or so. After the opening, the price of foreign wheat, coupled with the lingering effect of the previous week, made the openers feel quite strong. The price for this month opened at 5.10 cents, but although the opening price was good, it gradually weakened. Because the situation of Tianjin spot flour was not good, the Tianjin dealers were eager to sell. The opening price for January and beyond was initially stable, but then customers began to sell off, and some factories also hedged. Therefore, after the second session, the price fell steadily, making it difficult to recover, falling by 12 cents or so compared with the initial opening. By the afternoon session, the market atmosphere gradually deteriorated. Recently, due to the sluggish demand from Tianjin dealers, and rumors that a factory had ordered a ship of foreign wheat at 68 cents, the selling pressure for all months increased slightly, and the market atmosphere felt weak. As a result, this month fell by 2.5 cents, January fell by 2.75 cents, February fell by 2.25 cents, March fell by 2.75 cents, April fell by 3 cents, and May fell by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Decline Significantly</h3>
<p>In the wheat futures market, when the opening price was set, the market participants were generally watching, and the trend was flat. Later, as the flour market strengthened and then weakened, although trading was not very active, the market atmosphere loosened by 23 cents or so. By the time of the afternoon opening, trading was still quiet. However, the flour market reversed and fell due to actual sales returns, and rumors continued to circulate about another ship of foreign wheat being ordered. Therefore, the long-term sentiment gradually weakened, and the fluctuations compared with the closing price of the previous week were quite significant. January and February fell by 8 cents, and March fell by 10 cents. The spot wheat market is still stable. The opening price for Xuzhou Shandong white wheat is 3.94 yuan, the second grade is 9.20 yuan, and Yaowan wheat is 3.90 yuan, the second grade is 8.90 yuan. Fuxin sold 6,000 bags, Zaofeng sold 3,000 bags, and Shenci sold 1,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<p>The main reason for the stable market on the 1st was the lack of sellers of Chicago wheat and the firm market conditions in Liverpool. It is rumored that several places are using wheat instead of corn for feeding livestock. A well-known Chicago trader is currently recommending buying May oats.</p>

<h3>Glut of Japonica Rice, Sluggish Sales</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty dealers from various regions arrived, bringing over six thousand shih of goods. Sentiment remained weak, and the market atmosphere was soft. Local sales were normal, and dealers from other regions sold off their bagged rice due to the daily price declines. It is estimated that Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Tongzhou dealers bought a total of 1,400 to 1,500 bags. The selection was strict, and the bids were tight, so it did not help the overall situation. As a result, the price of late indica rice continued to fall by about 10 cents, and the price of thick japonica rice also fell by over 10 cents. Duyang Tip rice followed the trend of foreign rice, falling by about 10 cents. Only the price of Yin Bian Yuan rice remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-six or twenty-seven dealers arrived from the river regions, with over two hundred and ten boats in the river. In terms of market sales, the demand for loose white japonica rice was normal. The demand for bagged rice for restaurants improved slightly. Sales of Yang Du Tip rice declined compared to the previous improvement. The sales of new and old white Yuan and Yin Yuan loose rice were still good. Liquor stores continued to buy. Early thin indica rice was still good. The consignment of Tip rice from outports was sluggish. The early market for white japonica rice was flat and weak. At noon, a small amount of high-quality rice rose by a few cents, while medium and lower quality rice rose by a few cents to nearly 10 cents. The prices of Yang Tip and Du Tip rice rose slightly by a few cents. The prices of early thin indica rice, new and old white Yuan and Yin Yuan, and Tip rice from outports remained stable.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Tianjin Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>丨Foreign Indica and Local Indica Sales Both Strong丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, sales of both foreign and local indica rice were active, but production prices were high, and the intentions of hoarders were very firm. Moreover, the local demand was also active. Yesterday, the market price rose by 5 cents. Holders of futures rice did not sell, which people also took as a sign of hope. Later, Da___ released 1,750 bags, and Yali Jinlong, two foreign firms, released 1,250 bags, totaling 3,000 tons. The price also seemed firm. April Yuan grain reached as high as 5.05 yuan, long grain was 5.02 yuan, and December was 4.92 yuan. All were bought by local dealers. Currently, there are 5,500 bags of foreign rice open for sale. It was previously reported that the first two small shipments of Tianjin rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling 343 bags. Because the owner's asking price was too high, no sales were made. The quality is better than Annam japonica, but not as good as Changbang machine-milled japonica. Yesterday, local indica rice was snatched up by Changshu and Zhejiang dealers, and the market changed from weak to brisk, with over 10,000 bags offered, mainly Shashi brown rice, totaling over 7,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Sesame Sales from Foreign Firms Still Good Despite Price Drop</h3>
<p>丨Estimated at Over 40,000 Tons丨</p>
<p>Since the activity of sesame sales from foreign firms began, statistics show that since the new crop came on the market, there have been transactions of over 40,000 tons. The price has risen from 7.70-7.80 yuan to 9.50 yuan. Yesterday, the market softened slightly, with 100 tons traded at 9.30 yuan. The price fell by 20 cents, so sentiment in the market was unstable. Fortunately, the sales to other regions were still relatively good, preventing an excessive decline. Yesterday, 40 bags of Gaoyou sesame, 230 bags of Mingguang sesame, 51 bags of Taizhou sesame, 150 bags of Zhangbaling sesame, and 250 bags of Yingzhou yellow sesame were offered. Please refer to the market price column for price drops in the local Zhejiang and Shaoxing regions. Initially, soybean prices fell sharply by 10 cents due to the sudden drop in standard bean prices, causing sentiment to weaken, and prices fell by 7-8 cents. Later, news came that Dalian had rebounded, and the market atmosphere stabilized. Currently, there are inquiries from Tongzhou, local dealers, and inland factories, so the market situation is not too dire.</p>
<h3>Japonica Rice Market: Local Factory White Rice Exceptionally Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was generally flat due to the firm customs gold unit, but actual sales remained sluggish. The association's list price for number 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 18.55 yuan, delivery at the pier was 18.65 yuan, transit goods were 5.20 yuan, number 89 Dutch red high-quality sugar was 14.10 yuan, with some transactions. Ordinary sugar was 14 yuan and transit goods were 4.85 yuan. The local factory refined white sugar remained firm. Zhenji and Zhenyu had not offered any sugar for nearly 10 days. Yesterday, the market finally saw some continued sales. Zhenji and Zhenyu number 1 were both offered at 17.60 yuan, number 2 was 17.40 yuan, and number 3 was 17.20 yuan, an increase of about 1 yuan compared to the previous list price (24th). Taikoo sugar B mark was 19.60 yuan. A few hundred baskets of high-quality Zhuangtiao green sugar were offered at 10.08 yuan, over a hundred cases of cased Pianqing sugar, new goods at 10 yuan, and old goods at 9.70 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Regarding yesterday's sugar industry subscription draft, the cross character for Class A members limited to 50 shares should be corrected to the character 子. We hereby attach this correction.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Raw Peanuts' Sales Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to Qingdao telegraph, purchase prices for raw peanuts rebounded by 20 cents, and the tax exemption issue is expected to be implemented, making import and export easier to calculate. Sales improved, so market prices rebounded. In the morning, 2,000 bags of Tancheng peanuts were offered, with the higher grade at 6.55 yuan, and the second grade at 6.40 yuan, an increase of about 10 cents compared to the previous day. By the afternoon, the market became even tighter. 70 tons of Kaifeng peanuts were offered at 6.65 yuan, an improvement of about 60 cents compared to (1st). A small amount of Xuzhou peanuts were offered at 5.65 to 5.80 yuan, an increase of 20 cents compared to the previous day. Some sellers even wanted to sell at 6 yuan, and the trend was stable.</p>
<h3>Tensions in Foreign Exchange, Silk Sales Grow Quieter</h3>
<p>In recent days, foreign exchange has become tense, and silk sales in Europe and America have become increasingly sluggish. Yesterday morning, overseas telegraphs reported that silk prices were even lower. Chinese silk merchants did not have sufficient stock and held on to their goods, refusing to sell. Yesterday, only Dafeng and other firms imported 30 bales of white factory silk and 5 bales of white dried silk, with prices trending lower.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Price Drop in Antimony</h3>
<p>丨Production Price Too Low and Disparity with Market Price丨</p>
<p>Antimony is a necessity for ordnance factories, mints, and printing houses. Recently, due to tight credit, buyers have been unable to absorb it, so there have been few purchases. The trade, with goods, is anxious to sell due to the large difference between production costs and local prices. The production cost is about 500 yuan per ton, whereas Shanghai currently stands at 845 yuan, a difference of over 345 yuan. Therefore, everyone is trying to sell, so the market standard fell by 40 to 50 yuan yesterday. It is estimated at 800 yuan, with only 200 tons traded. Moreover, the business of foreign firms is not moving. Future asking prices are feared to fall further.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Shortage Appears Again</h3>
<p>The 18-gauge tinplate has recently experienced a shortage again. The market situation is good, so the price has risen again by 50 cents, selling at 10.05 yuan per bundle. It is said that enamel factories and thermos manufacturers are in urgent need, so there are more buyers, and the asking price is improving, it is said.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Dissent on "Literature and Life"</h3>
<p>— Wu Liping</p>
<p>A few days ago, in the "Free Talk" section, Mr. Lin Huanping wrote an article called "Literature and Life." He claimed that the motivation for writing this article was a letter he received from a poet who reported his intention to leave the literary world and delve into real life. The purpose was to indicate that the experience of actual life is the main condition for creating a literary figure. Based on this conclusion, he also expressed many opinions, using some well-worn phrases, and hyping up "life experience" and "image" to the skies. However, not a single word was said about what kind of life experience can practically capture images. Even if he says that observing life is possible and important, the possible conditions are still necessary. Mr. Lin did not tell us about this (assuming it is a) condition, nor did he state, "It cannot be covered in a short article." Thus, we have good reason to believe that Mr. Lin thought that once a literary figure ran into real life, all problems would be solved, as if real life guaranteed the creation of a great literary figure. Such a statement is optimistic enough; even more straightforward is "as a poet, I would very much agree with someone who wants to become a small clerk or junior staff member." This, of course, means going into real life in order to write poetry, emphasizing the six words "as a poet." Since Mr. Lin expressed his agreement with this attitude of participating in real life, he also expects great poems to be produced as a result. In fact, according to Mr. Lin's instructions and citations, he could easily guarantee that great poems will be produced in the future.</p>
<p>Although the article meanders quite a bit, it is actually just saying that literary figures must be able to, and must, be created through real life.</p>
<p>In principle, I completely agree with these two conclusions. What I disagree with is the explanation Mr. Lin added to these two conclusions.</p>
<p>First, I disagree that "as a poet," participating in real life can practically capture any images and can express the truth of life as its essence, because "as a poet" and a person are ultimately somewhat the same and somewhat different. Their attitudes towards participating in real life are also different, so their life content is also different. At this time, if what the poet captures and expresses belongs to the scope of a person, then its truthfulness becomes very questionable. If it belongs to one's own scope, then it is only one's own truth. So why bother delving into real life?</p>
<p>Second, I object to Mr. Lin citing Gorky as a witness to establish his argument, because Gorky did not participate in real life "as a poet" or "as a novelist," but only participated in real life as a person. This fact cannot be fabricated; his own life can testify to it. Although I cannot prove Balzac, Zola, Sinclair, and others in the same way, Mr. Lin has not proven that they participated in real life "as novelists."</p>
<p>I believe that if one wants to express the truth and essence of life, one must first live with the attitude of a person. Only direct life can touch the truth and essence of life. If one participates in real life with the qualification of a poet, even if one's attitude towards real life is not that of an onlooking game, it is at least using real life as a means. So, can one express the truth and essence of life? To give two very simple examples, Tao Yuanming returned to the countryside to farm, which should be considered participating in real life. However, he could only write poems such as "Leisurely Seeing the Southern Mountains." If "leisurely" is not the truth and essence of real life, then why is that? I think it must be because he participated in real life "as a poet." Closer to our time, the poet Chen Mengjia participated in the real life of the Shanghai Battle to find poetic material. Later, I heard that he published a book of poems dedicated to the Shanghai Battle, but unfortunately, it was not very great.</p>
<p>Therefore, participating in real life "as a poet" cannot fulfill Mr. Lin's wishes.</p>
<p>There are many others in China who are as optimistic as Mr. Lin. This phenomenon stems from the demands of reality. The poverty of Chinese literature is a fact, and the attempt to change this situation is a demand of reality. The answer to this demand is that literary figures are unanimously heading into real life. After they go, what happens? The answer is that everything is fine, according to Mr. Lin. But reality will disappoint Mr. Lin. If you don't believe it, ask the poets in the future if they want great poems, and you will know the result.</p>
<p>Literary figures are never created; they are just people who live in real life. Their works are just the experiences of direct life. They do not live in order to produce great works. If great literature appears in China, it will certainly not be the work of some "poet and novelist" type. However, there are no conditions for producing such literature now, but there is no need to imagine creating literary figures to decorate the lonely literary world.</p>
<p>A literary figure that cannot be created is equal to not being able to create a literary figure.</p>
<h3>Night Market</h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>The night market in Tokyo is even more lively than the daytime. If you want to buy cheap goods and books, you can go to the night market. Things that usually cost three or four dimes can be bought for only one dime at the night market. Because the entire economy is bankrupt and people have weak purchasing power, even though things are cheap to the point of a few cents, the piled-up goods remain as many every night. However, the people who stroll through the night market are like mountains and seas, always crowded to the point of being impenetrable. Naturally, seven or eight out of ten of these people are there to see the excitement or to take a walk to relieve boredom.</p>
<p>Because of the great famine in the Northeast, the male and female students standing on the street to collect donations are increasing day by day. They wear white sashes diagonally across their chests, with slogans such as "Northeast Relief Fund Raising Team" written on them. Some also write moving slogans, such as "Relief for Northeast Compatriots Who Are About to Die!" "Relief for Northeast Compatriots Suffering from Hunger and Cold!" Some use megaphones to shout loudly to passersby: "Northeast compatriots have eaten all the grass roots and tree bark, everyone donate some money to help!" But the passersby just walk past with their heads held high, no matter how the people holding donation boxes bow to them for help, they walk past without even glancing at them.</p>
<p>The radio is broadcasting melodious, intoxicating dance music. At this time, countless men and women are living sweet lives in movie theaters and dance halls. The Shinjuku night market is also different from three years ago. Putting aside the liveliness, what is astonishing at first sight is the male and female beggars with disheveled hair and skinny bones sitting under the terrazzo of Mitsukoshi. They wear ragged single clothes and shiver in the harsh north wind; in front of them is a piece of paper with words about how they were victimized and how poor they are. However, the eyes of the passersby are only cast on the brightly lit places, and their ears only hear the intoxicating music. Modern men and women hate these "馬鹿" (fools) who block the road.</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>The night market is suitable for ordinary small citizens and poor students. Wealthy people go to large companies to buy things, so naturally they don't need to come to the night market to seek cheapness. Therefore, the night market invisibly symbolizes a certain part of human society.</p>
<p>I often talk to my friends about how the Japanese are indeed too amazing. No matter what they manufacture, it is small, exquisite, light, and beautiful, with a kind of magic that attracts you to buy it. For example, a small box for storing tacks or pen nibs, rouge and powder, can be bought for only three or five cents. So the ladies who like small gadgets spare no effort to take out all the money in their purses and send it to the night market. It is because the goods are too cheap that everyone's consumption is particularly high, just like the devaluation of the Japanese yen, the number of students studying in Japan is increasing day by day. On the surface, it seems that we are taking advantage of Japan by coming to study at this time, but in fact, when they are experiencing economic panic, large groups of Chinese students are coming to give them money. No wonder they desperately say: "Arigato, gozaimasu." (This sentence is a casual transliteration)</p>
<p>Unless you have particularly strong reason, I'm afraid no one can resist the temptation of material things. When you go to the night market, even a person who loves money like life will give away at least a few dimes to the Japanese. The only thing that can control your emotions and prevent you from buying those beautiful and cheap things is not reason, but money.</p>
<p>The night market in Kanda mostly sells books, while the night markets in Shinjuku and other places sell various daily necessities, clothing, and food.</p>
<p>Blood-red lights, soul-stirring music, noisy hawking, tragic cries for help... create the symphony of the Tokyo night market.</p>
<h3>Face</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhifang</p>
<p>Clever people often dress themselves up, like gentlemen or ladies. In short, besides a set of usual wide clothes, their characteristics are a pair of slightly furrowed eyebrows and a light nasal sound that indicates contempt, to teach the "ignorant and foolish" or "lowly people" in their eyes.</p>
<p>As soon as they come out, they point one finger to the sky and one finger to the ground, saying: "In the universe, I am the only one who is supreme." Others seem to be like mud statues sculpted in temples, looking at the bare-chested, prodigal-like Buddha, who should be "standing gods" or simply sleep under their big toes.</p>
<p>If they are "genuine literary figures" from the university's literature department, then they say to someone who doesn't have the ability to receive the same education as them, but who still dabbles in literature and writes something:</p>
<p>"Have you read Dante? Have you read a better outline of literature or something?"</p>
<p>This is said with a strong tone of pity; on the other hand, it is enough to highlight one's own abundance of talent and erudition. If the person being taught is really too much, then it seems like they are too hurt. They can immediately temporarily abandon their identity, redden their eyes, straighten their noses, and declare that they will verbally criticize and denounce him. Then, words like "ignorant," "shallow," or even "willingly degenerate," "being used by others," etc., are enough to pile up a tomb, making it impossible for you to breathe. Only then will they be satisfied.</p>
<p>However, they themselves would never write an article to compete. Perhaps, as Kagawa Toyohiko said, they intentionally emphasize a "flaw of beauty"? But as historically proven, they are actually "golden branches and jade leaves," and probably don't need to move a finger to already be "celebrities" or something similar.</p>
<p>Therefore, they don't need us to "forcibly and rudely" strip off their wide clothes and tear off their powdered faces. They themselves are the most faithful artists of their own art. That is, their faces have already been painted subtly and vividly by themselves. Although they have no works, it is said that they are also quite cultivated. They close their eyes and say that others are "ignorant" and "shallow," and they are second to none.</p>
<p>However, counterfeit goods will always one day reveal their true form. Without us bothering to strip off their decorations and puncture their masks, people will also see that the painted faces are fake.</p>
<h3>The Sounds of Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Huanming</p>
<p>Every day, I hide in the house. The house faces south. From noon to noon, morning and night, the sea breeze blows incessantly.</p>
<p>During the day, I am busy doing this and touching that, but often I can't do anything really important. After eight o'clock at night, the entire Qingdao is shrouded in an atmosphere like late autumn.</p>
<p>"Sugar buns, bean buns..."</p>
<p>This drawn-out sound echoes desolately under the window. This sentiment is similar to the sound of selling white sugar and heart porridge late at night in the alleyways of the South. The person selling bean buns is probably wearing black clothes. He carries a large basket on his arm, and in the other hand, he holds an oil lamp. He stops at the door, shouts twice, hesitates a few steps, and then slowly shuffles away.</p>
<p>At this time, there is probably always fog at sea. I open the window and look towards the sea. The red light on Little Qingdao flickers hazily. It's very beautiful, but also very lonely. When there is fog, the harbor also "whoo, whoo" emits a groan to warn passing ships. The sound waves are mixed with the roaring of the sea tide surging against the rocks. Sometimes, I can also hear the sound of shouting "Car!" carried by the sea breeze. At this time, the "Luo Han Qigong Treatment Center" across the street gradually becomes lively. The sound of whips cracking resounds strangely...</p>
<p>I once secretly went to "sightsee." It was like this: the person being treated took off his upper body and circulated his energy, letting the whip jump on his body. It is said that this can also cure diseases, and this kind of treatment is very believed and popular among a segment of the population in Qingdao. I also have illnesses, but I have not dared to treat them in this way.</p>
<p>I live in an alleyway house in Shanghai. The first sound in the morning is "pouring out the chamber pot." The sound of the clam shell scrubbing the chamber pot, "sha sha sha," is absolutely not heard in the North. What replaces the "sha sha sha" of the southern morning is the sound of the boiling water whistle, "li li li," from the boiling water shop. This boiling water shop is equivalent to the "tiger stove" in the South, but there are also differences: they don't use iron pots to boil water, but rather a large lead-skinned cylinder, and there is also a tap for tap water installed underneath. Selling boiling water is a subsidiary business of the general store. The general store has vegetables, fruits, and all kinds of daily household sundries. Not only do they sell "Aji-no-moto" (Japanese), but sometimes you can even buy monosodium glutamate! I have been in the South for many years and have never seen "Aji-no-moto" in a southern goods store. This should be a "difference between North and South," right? ... At first, I was very fortunate that tap water was, after all, not a foreign product, but now I know that the tap water used in my home is exported by the Japanese-capitalized match company. My father said:</p>
<p>"Sales are the best..."</p>
<p>When a person is lonely and bored, he often leans against the window and stares blankly at the road, or listens to the clattering of donkey carts on the road. The people pulling the carts must be "the blackest people in China," wearing black clothes and pants, with their lapels open, revealing their dark brown chests. Their faces are stained with coal ash. They advance three steps and retreat two steps on the sloping street, leaning at a 50- or 60-degree angle. The shoes they wear are also black - black "labor shoes." Of course, they are also Japanese goods.</p>
<p>On the street, the rhythmic sound of wooden clogs can be heard everywhere. Japanese housewives carry "large bundles" (this is for insiders), bending over and running to the "big vegetable market" to buy things. The shop assistants pile on smiling faces, warmly greeting them. Their tone and demeanor are just like "Japanese devils," without any sense of shame...</p>
<p>Even the most basic, most foolish shop assistants know a few words of Japanese to greet their customers.</p>
<p>Seashore</p>
<p>The American flagship floats quietly at anchor. "Pat, pat, pat," the small steamboat carries white sailors alongside the "pier."</p>
<p>"Richa..."</p>
<p>They jump into the car in a noisy group, pointing ahead: "U.S. Bar"</p>
<p>"Aye!" They rush towards Zhongshan Road like flying.</p>
<p>The sorrow of the Southerners, and the sorrow of the Chinese:</p>
<p>"Where is your hometown, sir..."</p>
<p>"I'm from Shandong. Are you, old brother, from, uh, Hebei? Or..."</p>
<p>"I'm from Zhejiang..."</p>
<p>"Oh," his face seems to have changed color a bit: "Zhejiang, Zhejiang, is probably in the South? Then, sir, are you a 'Southerner'?"</p>
<p>"Southerners" and "Northerners" are divided the most clearly here. They are divided as clearly as Northerners and Japanese.</p>
<p>The sounds of Qingdao are full of the sentiment of Dalian!</p>
<p>But there are also differences; because Dalian is even cooler than Qingdao! No, there is one more thing that is different. Geographically speaking, Dalian is further north than Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (7)</h3>
<p>— (By Joseph Conrad) Translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>"He must think he has 'planned ahead' for you to some extent. That's the best way for daughters... That's the husband..." He winks. Miss Bessan is engrossed in her knitting work, blushing slightly.</p>
<p>"Bessan! My hat!" Old Javir suddenly shouted madly. He had been sitting under the tree without saying a word. He didn't move, like a strange, absurd idol in superstition. He never spoke, but when looking for him, when speaking to her about her, he always shouted rudely. At that time, he never softened his embarrassing speech. Her way of dealing with it was to be completely silent; he would continue to shout until she came to serve him - that is, until she came to shake his arm, or put the mouthpiece of his pipe in his teeth. He was one of the few blind people who smoked. When he felt the hat had been placed on his head, he immediately stopped making noise. Then he stood up, and the two of them walked through the gate together.</p>
<p>He leaned heavily on her arm. In their slow, laborious steps, she seemed to be dragging a large, indecisive block of wood to confession. Usually, they immediately crossed the road (the two cottages were built in the fields near the sea entrance, two hundred yards from the end of the street). After a very, very long time, they were still in front of people, groping to walk up the wooden steps to the seawall. The seawall meandered from east to west, blocking the waters of the English Channel, like an abandoned railway embankment, on which no train had ever run. Groups of burly fishermen appeared from the horizon, walked along the coast for a while, and then slowly disappeared. Their brown nets, like the webs of huge spiders, were laid out on the uneven grass on the slope to dry. The people in the town, looking from the end of the street, could recognize from their slow little steps that it was Javir and his daughter, Captain Hagbolt, aimlessly... The surroundings of his two small houses also had to raise their heads to see where their walk had reached.</p>
<p>He still regularly published advertisements in the Sunday newspaper searching for Harry, Hagbolt, he first told Bessan, these newspapers could be read in all parts of the world. At the same time, he seemed to think that his son was still in England - very close to Colebrook, he could definitely find him "tomorrow." Bessan didn't use many words to oppose that opinion, only saying that if that was the case, the advertising fee was wasted; Captain Hagbolt should still calculate how he was making a living from that weekly shilling (worth two and a half shillings). She declared that she didn't know how he was relying on that to survive. Her tone must have made him doubt and have a short period of sadness in his heart. "People are doing this," he pointed out. The newspaper had a full page dedicated to advertisements searching for missing relatives. He even had to take the newspaper to show her. He and her wife had been advertising for several years; but she was an impatient woman. The news from Colebrook came just one day after his funeral; if she had not been so impatient, she might still be here waiting for a long time. "You are not an impatient woman, my dear."</p>
<p>"Sometimes I am with you, and I can't bear it," she always replied.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Women's Rights and French</h3>
<p>— Pi</p>
<p>Chairman Fu Bingchang of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee recently went to Hong Kong from Beijing, passing through Shanghai. Before leaving Shanghai, he spoke with a reporter on the train about Article 239 of the Criminal Code regarding adultery, which was quite interesting (the original text is omitted). I have two doubts about Fu's remarks: (1) a doubt about the issue of women's rights; (2) a doubt about French.</p>
<p>In the past two decades or so, the women's rights movement has been extremely high, as if women's rights were insignificant to some extent. After reviewing the second criminal law review case passed by the Legislative Yuan, there is a provision that "a married woman who commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and the adulterer shall be subject to the same punishment." The women's community believes that this is a provision that insults women, and they are greatly indignant. They joined women's circles inside and outside Beijing to petition in Beijing. As a result, the Legislative Yuan re-deliberated and changed it to "a person with a spouse, etc." Such a satisfactory result is rare in history, if we look at it historically, for men to go to Beijing to petition due to some problem and be able to obtain such a satisfactory result. Therefore, women's rights have not been seen to decline in any way, this is one thing.</p>
<p>Fu also said, "This case was originally passed to be removed from the criminal law, but later because some members of the Legislative Yuan wanted to stipulate a practice that has not changed for thousands of years in China (referring to punishing married women who commit adultery). Therefore, there was a second review of the criminal law passed. This time, because of the opposition of the women's community, when repeated discussions were held, some members were opposed by their wives, so those who previously advocated stipulating a thousand-year practice reversed their previous advocacy and instead demanded equal regulations." From this point of view, the "wife power" of the legislators is several times higher than that of the legislators. Why is there still a women's rights movement? This is another matter.</p>
<p>The so-called women's rights movement is because women's rights are less than men's rights, and husband's rights are higher than wife's rights, so there is a demand for equality between men and women. Now women's rights are higher than everything, and wife's rights are superior to husband's rights, which is completely contrary to the facts. Women's rights are higher than everything, originally from today onwards, the so-called "Hedong Lion's Roar," "Ji Chang's Fear of His Wife," etc., there are many romantic historical examples. I think someone will definitely initiate a men's rights movement in the future to resist the women's community, which may also be expected.</p>
<p>Also, the currently revised article states, "A person with a spouse who commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and the adulterer shall be subject to the same punishment." Since the article is stipulated in this way, adultery by a person without a spouse cannot be used as an example. Suppose a person with a spouse commits adultery with a person without a spouse, then the person without a spouse is presumably not guilty, and cannot be convicted for committing adultery with a person with a spouse. The article stipulates this clearly, but Fu Bingchang said, "Prostitutes are also guilty of the crime that article deserves." I am not only speaking out for the prostitute community, but also want to appeal for those without spouses who commit adultery with others, because how can prostitutes who entertain patrons know whether they have spouses? The same situation applies to those without spouses who commit adultery with others. Therefore, the phrase "the adulterer shall be subject to the same punishment" is somewhat inconsistent with the wording, because in the case of a person with a spouse committing adultery with a person without a spouse, is the adulterer guilty of the same crime or a different crime? This point is not clearly stipulated in French, which is a real doubt.</p>
<p>If it is said that the difficulties in which prostitutes will find themselves in the future are not necessarily visible. As long as the French law clearly stipulates that those without spouses are not included in this example, or the sentence "the adulterer shall be subject to the same punishment" is cancelled, then there will be a way for prostitutes to deal with it. Just paste a red paper slip on the door, "This apartment only entertains guests without wives. Guests with wives are not entertained. We hereby declare and ask for your forgiveness." In this way, they will not be innocently punished.</p>
<h3>On "Deception"</h3>
<p>— Li An</p>
<p>I feel that the Chinese people in the world are the most capable of deceiving people, and also the easiest to be deceived by others. Therefore, the art of "deceiving the world and stealing a name" is most popular in China; as long as a person has one point of ability, and can also have nine points of "deceiving the world and stealing a name" skills, he will definitely be a popular figure in society; on the contrary, even if you have nine points of true learning, but do not have one point of "deceiving the world and stealing a name" ability, you will never be allowed to stand out in your life. The fundamental crux of this problem is that the atmosphere of boasting and pretense is too prevalent from top to bottom. People are unwilling to be practical in everything, and only know how to show off and put effort into appearances. Therefore, in such a depressed year, clothing stores are still constantly opening; while the circulation of popular newspapers is still less than 200,000 copies. This indicates that knowledge is only stored in the heart, while clothing is a good thing that can deceive the world.</p>
<p>Let me give a few examples! A Western charlatan runs to China, hangs up the title of professor, and stays at the Waldorf Hotel, and someone will voluntarily give him money. On the contrary, Wang Tiezui of the City God Temple, although he also knows how to flaunt "King Wen" and "Duke Zhou," is far behind professors in business acumen. Wang Tiezui has never put effort into the word "deception," and is not as insightful as professors about the Chinese people's tendency to be deceived. Therefore, Tiezui suffers a loss. A few months ago, there was a problem with literary heritage in the literary world. Everyone was pulling in Gorky, Chekhov, etc., as window dressing in a lively manner. In my opinion, China's literary heritage seems to be figures like Qu Yuan, Zhuangzi, and Confucius. However, if you have the courage to bring up people like Qu Yuan, no one will look at you. Gorky and Chekhov are fashionable, and the general public will show respect to you. This consciousness is the same as when you go to a store to buy things. American goods are certainly better than Chinese goods, and MadienChina seems to be more superior than Made in China. Therefore, domestic tobacco companies have all stopped printing Chinese on their products!</p>
<p>Because I am dissatisfied with modern "American-style education," I have repeatedly proposed adopting the "Shuyuan system" to improve modern education. I have spent some effort studying it and feel that this system is the most reasonable and natural education; it is comparable to Oxford-style education, and adopting this system is the best way to save modern education. However, the Shuyuan education system was unfortunately produced in China, and China simply does not have a good system. I wrote an article about the Shuyuan system and took it to a friend for discussion. He said to me, "If you want this article to attract people's attention, the first thing you should do is change 'Shuyuan system' to 'Oxford system.' The Chinese people are good at deceiving people and good at being deceived by others, so you must deceive them a little." He smiled as he said this, and I smiled too.</p>
<p>I remember someone once said: "The difficulty in China lies in the excessive atmosphere of boasting and pretense from top to bottom." Boasting and pretense means not being practical, and also deceiving the world and stealing a name. Today we advocate something, and tomorrow we advocate another thing. Making declarations and sending telegrams, of course, there is a grand and eloquent embellished article, but ask how many things these advocates can do themselves?</p>
<p>People who rely on the word "deception" to parasitize in society are everywhere, like gilded chamber pots placed in society to do the work of deception. They flaunt the titles of PhDs, returned students, educators, and scholars, and swagger through the world doing ghostly tricks. If these masks are not exposed, there is no remedy.</p>

<h3>After the Plan Was Realized</h3>
<p>— Hong Ben</p>
<p>To put it in a twisted way, the realization of my plan owes a considerable debt to that nameless petty thief. If my leather coat hadn't been stolen by him, this plan definitely wouldn't have been realized this year. Because I have always been a person who loves to talk but doesn't like to act, many things, I think about so thoroughly in my heart and say so beautifully with my mouth, but I have never seen them put into practice. This is my old habit, and I truly feel more than a little ashamed when I say it.</p>
<p>Last year, at a certain banquet, because I was wearing an inappropriate long gown, I was ridiculed by others. On the spot, I pondered in my mind and silently vowed to make a suit. But, alas, "time passed and the heart calmed," and by the next day I had forgotten about it again. Firstly, it was indeed because the "large amount" at the time was not enough for me to spend. But in reality, it was mostly due to "being too lazy to put it into practice." I would rather stop attending banquets afterwards when I suddenly remembered that I had no suit to wear, fearing that I would be ridiculed by others again.</p>
<p>It was only when I encountered the "iron-faced and ruthless" petty thief, who stole my leather coat in just five minutes of negligence, that I moved from "thinking" and "talking" to drafting a plan, and recently, I actually put on a suit.</p>
<p>Although I have already put it on, there is still a story to tell, which is the state of mind when trying it on. Having always been such a rustic person, now wearing a straight suit, I felt strangely flustered. Pacing back and forth in the room, I struggled with the first step, lacking the courage to step out of the door. In fact, when I walked out, everyone looked at me with nothing more than an indifferent glance.</p>
<p>However, my mood was still somewhat uneasy: I always vaguely saw people staring at me, discussing me, even satirizing me, saying that someone like me should never wear such a straight suit. Although I have been wearing the suit for a month, this scene still lingers around me, swirling before my eyes, making me extremely uneasy.</p>
<p>Secondly, it has added a kind of burden. I have always been a casual person. In the past, I not only didn't care about my clothes but also didn't cherish them. I would casually wipe the table with my sleeves, use my lapel to hold things, and sleep in my clothes at night, all of which were very common. But now I can't do that anymore. In order to maintain the beauty of the suit, I have to keep my back straight when walking, wipe the dust off the stool before sitting down, and be careful not to drip oil stains on my clothes when eating. What makes me most painful is that before taking off my clothes to go to bed, I have to fold the creases of my pants very carefully before I can sleep peacefully. Otherwise, if I throw them around like my old Chinese-style trousers, and the creases disappear when I put them on in the morning, wouldn't that be a laughingstock for suit wearers?</p>
<p>As for the trouble of wearing it, such as tying the tie again and again, polishing the leather shoes again and again, brushing the clothes again and again, and looking in the mirror again and again, these are minor matters and need not be mentioned further.</p>
<p>Recently, it has even stirred up a rumor. Several colleagues who I often interact with have unanimously said that I have changed too suddenly and must have some kind of ambition or bad intentions. Heaven knows! What's most annoying is that a few days ago, when I saw a friend I hadn't seen for a long time, he blurted out, "I heard you're in love now, and wearing a suit is solid proof." A friend's letter even affirmed that I had made progress in my career. It's truly being wronged alive.</p>
<p>At this point, I feel that I can't wear a suit, at least not someone like me.</p>
<h3>The Story of Socks</h3>
<p>— Wen Hei</p>
<p>Because I had nothing to do, I went for a stroll on the road after dinner.</p>
<p>The night in the city is a city that never sleeps. The electric lights are so bright that the road is almost like daytime. Also, neon lights draw patterns in the air and write large characters, red, green, purple, blue, colorful, dazzling people's eyes. As I walked, I came to the entrance of a general store, where many people like me were standing on the road, listening to the radio broadcast on the door. A passage in the Suzhou dialect was telling a story. I didn't understand it and wanted to leave, but a glance at the glass display window, some cheap daily necessities attracted me. A two-pound thermos only costs forty cents, enough. I remembered that I used to buy a thermos for one dollar each, regretting not waiting a little longer to buy it now. There was already a thermos on the table at home, it could not tempt my heart to save money. However, it was also because of the cheap thermos that I wanted to know if there were any more bargains to be bought. Oh, socks are one dollar for five pairs. Thinking that I only have one pair of socks at home, and there's a hole in the front and a hole in the heel, I'll buy them for one dollar. Besides being enough for myself, I can also give my younger brother two pairs. Having made up my mind, I walked into its door. Considering myself as a customer, I found it funny to myself, what's so impressive about a one-dollar customer? In this way, I became humble and felt embarrassed for a long time, not daring to open my mouth, but the shop assistants paid close attention to me. A gentleman in a long robe ran over to greet me, "Hat?" He thought I was going to buy a hat. Or maybe he thought his shop's hats were the best. I scratched my head to indicate that I didn't want to buy a hat, but at the same time, I glanced at the side where many hats were piled up, subconsciously wanting to see what his hats looked like. After glancing at them, I immediately felt that I should reply to the shop assistant, so I said "Socks", considering it as correcting his mistake and indicating my purpose in entering his shop. In this way, he became busy, and I felt more important, considering myself not a person who just came to wander around but a customer.</p>
<p>It was already winter, and the cold wind was still howling in the streets, so it was no wonder that he took out woolen socks for me to see. I said it wasn't this kind. But I couldn't say "cheap" for a long time. He misunderstood me, thinking that the color was wrong. The original color was dark red, so he took out a light yellow one. When he was closing the box to get another one, I already felt sorry for him: If I still didn't want it when he opened another box, wouldn't that be too impatient and unhappy for him? I got anxious and didn't care about much, directly telling him, "One dollar for five pairs." He didn't get angry but smiled at me and said, "Oh, yes, yes." In this way, when he took out the socks that were one dollar for five pairs for me to choose, I felt that I had to buy them, otherwise I would be too sorry. Moreover, at the same time, I felt that cheap goods were so-so, and it wouldn't be right to be too picky. The deal was done, I took out one dollar, and he wrapped up the five pairs of socks for me.</p>
<p>Leaving the store, I still heard his polite words, "Come again next time." I didn't reply to him anything, but it attracted the attention of the people standing at the door listening to the radio broadcast, who looked at me with envious and curious eyes.</p>
<p>Returning home, I put down the socks and did other things. But when I put the socks on my feet the next morning, I pulled them hard, and they broke! I broke two pairs in a row. Fortunately, the third pair didn't break. But I had already learned the lesson of being greedy for cheap things.</p>
<h3>Night in the Artery</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>Time is moving, the city is moving, people are moving.</p>
<p>After the curtain of night is drawn, the pulse of the metropolis is in turmoil, with big mouths open everywhere, swallowing people wildly. Along this wind-swept breath, the crowd of people rolls on.</p>
<p>"Darling," she smiles, this word is called out so sweetly.</p>
<p>"Hmm," putting down the evening paper in his hand, he rushes over. The blood, as if unable to contain this heart, makes it jump involuntarily.</p>
<p>Soft velvet sofa, a bronze table lamp on the glass panel, a cotton gauze lampshade embroidered with flowers, and the light from the lampshade of ocher color bathes their faces, what a happy couple!</p>
<p>"I want..." Again, she giggles, playing with the narrow cuffs, "to go to Shanghai, okay?"</p>
<p>The road is in turmoil, people's feet are in turmoil, the sound is in turmoil...</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>"Hey, Lao Zhang, Lao Li, let's have a midnight snack!"</p>
<p>Really, mentioning midnight snack, can make Lao Zhang's heart move, he thought, this should be the right time, the sky is high and the air is crisp, the crabs are fat and the chrysanthemums are yellow, it is time to open up and drink heartily.</p>
<p>Fat crabs, really enough to make one drool, at the intersection of Ri Sheng Lou, in that gray-blue big tank, one by one, look, how big, Yangcheng Lake's.</p>
<p>Surrounding the small charcoal fire, surrounding the small round table, pinching the small cups!</p>
<p>"Drink, drink as much as you can!" Then, he gulps down wine, his face flushed, his heart as hot as charcoal fire.</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>In the Dancing hall:</p>
<p>When the pulse of the metropolis is slightly still, he walks out of the stone steps of the office with a tired mood. Somehow, when the dazzling light touches him, the fatigue will run away.</p>
<p>Music, lingeringly sounding, all around, it's all dark, on the roof, this time it's green, gloomy, like falling asleep.</p>
<p>Dance, what is sprinkled on this top is the warp of the sky,</p>
<p>, this lingering weft is exactly the wandering soul!</p>
<p>The fragrance of clothes, the fragrance of powder, those pairs, are the fragrance of love.</p>
<p>However, in the pulse of the night, there may also jump out a few big men from the oblique waist!</p>
<p>Stop, don't sound, leave the money. You may also be caught by the clothes without being vigilant!</p>
<p>Thank you, okay, count it as eight cents.</p>
<p>Night, continues in this moving pulse.</p>

<p>Waiting for the moon in the West Chamber, the moon gradually rises. Hongniang follows and serves the beautiful lady. The young lady is like a jade hairpin, without flaws. Two gold hairpins divide her cloud-like hair. Double pearl earrings flutter. White silk shirt exudes a different fragrance in the wind. Jade arms wear a pair of gold bracelets. A pearl hanging on her chest dazzles the eyes. Embroidered handkerchief in her pointed hand. Pink trousers tied around her slender waist. Gauze knee pads and silk ribbons. Red embroidered shoes with perfect toe. Standing by the Wild Goose Cloud Pavilion. Nine lotus lanterns hung in front of the pavilion. Dew wets the green moss, and the white rabbit stares. The wind blows butterflies dreaming in the shade of flowers. Red pear trees are full of red pear blossoms. Peony flowers wither in the peony pavilion. Leaning on the Cloud Terrace, too lazy to pluck the lute. Banana leaf fans swat fireflies. I am ten thousand miles away and see Zhang Junrui. Zhang Sheng meets his soulmate in the Buddhist temple. Retreating the bandit soldiers shows the meritorious Qilin Pavilion. Good is Kongming in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Tonight, the bright moon shines in the Emerald Garden. Kneeling on the brocade futon, secretly confessing sincerity. I wish to dismantle the toad palace, hang up the gold list. A happy marriage, a wedding candle tied with flowers. Eternal reunion, a hundred-year marriage.</p>

<p>Do you not see the Yellow River's waters descend from heaven, rushing into the sea, never to return? Do you not see the high hall, bright mirror, grieving over white hair, like green silk in the morning, turning into clouds at dusk? When life is fulfilling, enjoy it to the fullest, let not the golden cup face the moon in vain! Heaven has endowed me with talent, which must be useful, even if a thousand gold is spent, it will return. Cook sheep and slaughter cattle, let's have fun, we must drink three hundred cups at once. Cenfuzi, Danqiusheng, drink up, don't stop your cup! I will sing a song for you, please all of you listen carefully. Bell drums and jade delicacies are not worth cherishing, but I wish to be drunk forever and not wake up. In ancient times, sages and virtuous men were all lonely, only drinkers left their names. Chen Wang held a banquet at Ping Le Palace in the past, ten thousand coins for a dou of wine, indulging in joy. Why does the host say he has little money? You must get drunk before me. Five-flower horse, thousand-gold fur coat, call the boy to take them out to exchange for fine wine, to dispel ten thousand years of sorrow with you.</p>

<h3>Hollywood's Golden Child</h3>
<p>— A trickle</p>
<p>=A child's value is 150 times that of gold=</p>
<p>=The cost of childbirth cannot be calculated with common sense=</p>
<p>Some say that the value of a child born to a Hollywood movie star is equal to the value of their weight in gold. But if we calculate more meticulously, we can know that a child born to a female star is actually one hundred and fifty times more valuable than its weight in gold. Do you say this is baseless? Well, for example, if a child is born weighing ten pounds, according to the value of gold of the same weight, it is only worth $58,000. But its real value is no less than one million U.S. dollars. Isn't this more than one hundred and fifty times more valuable than its weight in gold? Let's take Joan Blondell's child as an example. When calculating the price of a child, we are not limited to the cost of childbirth and upbringing; we must also add the money that has to be spent because of the child, or the money that could be saved and earned more if there were no child. In this way, Joan's salary loss due to having a child has already reached 35,000 yuan. The film company's contract can generally be extended according to the length of the maternity period. Therefore, if a female star takes a year off work due to childbirth, her contract will also be extended for one year until the original contract term expires. The salary loss during this period can be calculated on paper, but the actual loss she suffers is more than this number and cannot be statistically calculated. You must know that the audience's preferences for movies are very changeable. If a young female star's physical condition is affected by childbirth, the loss will be enormous. If she stays away from the screen for too long, the audience forgets her name, or new female stars take her place, then her loss is unimaginable, or even irreparable for life.</p>
<p>Someone calculated that the time a female star in Hollywood stops working due to childbirth is generally eight months: three months before childbirth and five months after childbirth. But many female stars spend a year or a year and a half giving birth to a child. According to Helen Twelvetrees' calculation, she lost no less than $100,000 in a very short period of time to have a son. Joan Crawford took three years off to have a son, and now she finds it very difficult to return to the screen. Clara Bow had to reject many lucrative contracts because she wanted to have a child.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cost of childbirth is generally thought to be borne by the female star herself. In fact, the film company's losses are also enormous. When Joan Blondell was filming her last film before giving birth, the special equipment prepared for her in the company was considerable. Moreover, the working hours were shortened every day, and many supporting actors and staff had to act according to her schedule. Therefore, Joan Blondell's various losses in the company when she gave birth to a child already amounted to hundreds of thousands of yuan. It is said that Hollywood film companies spend $300 per minute when filming. If it is filming a large scene, the loss is even more than this. When Joan was filming (Sames), it is impossible to calculate how many minutes were spent, but it is not absolutely unreasonable to say that tens of thousands of dollars were spent.</p>
<p>Two male stars, Bing Crosby and Harold Lloyd, spent a lot of special money on their children. That is certainly an exception, but it also shows how much money movie stars can spend. Harold Lloyd said that he only knew the benefit of having money when his child was born. If he didn't have money, his child would not have survived. It turned out that his child was a premature birth and had to be placed in a glass incubator, wrapped in cotton, and slowly taught to breathe and eat things. That was the most expensive equipment in science, and only the richest people could afford it. Bing Crosby's twin sons were also premature. When they were born, each weighed only four pounds, but they are still alive today using the same method. As for the hospital fees during childbirth, the stars pay ten times more than ordinary people. They hire special nurses, who take turns in three shifts a day. In addition, there are many places where medical experts need to be consulted, and the cost is even more shocking to say.</p>
<p>In addition, an even larger expense is the security fee. We have heard a lot about Hollywood kidnappers and how stars protect their children. Marlene Dietrich specially sent her daughter to Europe for her safety. The rest of the stars hire bodyguards or add defensive equipment, which can be said to be painstaking. But we won't talk about that here.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Judge Priest"</h3>
<p>— Stone Axe</p>
<p>"Judge Priest" showing in Shanghai</p>
<p>The word "humor" has become popular in China. We all know George Bernard Shaw in England, but there is also a great humorist in Hollywood, America, who earns top salaries and is famous in the film industry, Will Rogers, who has not yet been recognized by our Chinese people. This master of humor absolutely adheres to the American creed of peace first. He often resolves disputes with subtle words, and his life truths can turn hostility into friendship. In the films he has starred in in the past, we can understand that he is such a wonderful person. It seems to be a higher level than George Bernard Shaw's deliberately portraying and wasting vitality satire.</p>
<p>This "Judge Priest" we must know that it is adapted from a novel extracting some personality traits about Judge Priest. We can regard it as an anecdote. We can see that this judge is extremely emotional and sympathetic to the public. His personality is almost contradictory to law and politics. Therefore, we have a good show to watch here. He is trying cases with the principle of "making the people not compete by weighing measures and leveling scales," and he is also working as a matchmaker for people, so that those who are in love can become husband and wife. On the surface, he is humorous and cynical, but in reality, he is a person who laughs with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>The American Civil War is indeed a glorious war history that can be praised. The heroes who captured flags and killed generals at that time were fighting for freedom, which is indeed more valuable than any world war. It is very gratifying to use this war to secretly set off the theme of the whole play. In order to prevent the performance of such stories from being warlike, many permanently enthusiastic Southern Melodies such as My Kentucky Home, Old Folks at Home, Dixie, Marching Through Georgia have been added to increase the audience's pleasure, especially these types of songs must be sung by black people.</p>
<p>The interspersed humor is very suitable for humorous conditions, and it is completely different from ordinary slapstick comedies. Eating ice cream and having a sugar party is very novel. The supporting actors are also veterans, so they complement each other.</p>
<p>This is a film worth introducing.</p>
<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>LeRoy, the most beloved child star in Hollywood, who first appeared on the screen in "When the Night is Deep" and gained fame, is now just one year old, but he has already saved enough tuition to graduate from university.</p>
<p>According to Adolphe Menjou, the first master of dressing in Hollywood, if you want to be a gentleman, you should wear the Chester coat, Gary Cooper's coat, Lowell Sherman's hat, Robert Montgomery's tie, William Powell's pants, and Clark Gable's shoes.</p>
<p>The most popular star in America right now. You won't believe it, but it's Shirley Temple, who is only four years old this year! Of course, she will never read the lines in the film; but she can memorize the lines faster than ordinary actors. Her method is: first, her mother reads the lines to her carefully twice, and then she says it herself in the same way, so she has already memorized it.</p>
<p>Mae West has a total of fifteen different kinds of ordinary clothes. She changes one of them every day. She has her nails manicured three times a week, of course, all painted pink. There is not even a piece of pajamas in her home, all of them are those luxurious evening dresses!</p>
<p>George Bancroft used to be from a circus troupe, so the "Happy Go Lucky" that was recently shown in Shanghai is his autobiography.</p>
<p>Carole Lombard was a famous high jumper in her school days.</p>
<p>John Bowers held a wedding ceremony in his new film "The Life of the West": this can be said to be his "first" wedding on the screen.</p>
<p>Douglas Montgomery's teeth are the whitest in Hollywood.</p>
<h3>"Escape" Becomes Real</h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>Since "Escape" returned from filming on location in Zhangjiakou, last night it resumed filming the scene of the Northeastern people fleeing during the "September 18th" Incident. Director Yue Feng and Tang Na specially made hundreds of fake bombs with the same shape as real bombs but containing a small amount of gunpowder in advance in order to make the war scenes realistic. Although these bombs are not real bombs, they can explode if thrown hard on the ground and can also cause damage. When filming this interior scene of the "September 18th" Northeastern Incident last night, Wang Yin, Yuan Meiyun, Cang Yinqiu, Ye Juanjuan, Qin Tong, Jin Xingan, etc., played the Northeastern people. Dozens of other male actors played soldiers of a certain country, throwing bombs at the Northeastern refugees. For a time, the sound of bombing and the cries of refugees were mixed together, and the scene was realistic. The neighbors on all sides of the company heard the sound and suspected that the war had restarted, and they were too panicked to sleep. Unexpectedly, at this tense moment, several bombs were thrown at the faces of Ye Juanjuan, Qin Tong, and Jin Xingan. When they heard a loud bang, the faces of all three were injured by the explosion, and they fell to the ground in extreme pain. They were immediately helped up and rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. Because the injuries were not very serious, they were discharged from the hospital after the doctor applied medicine and bandages. (sic)</p>
<h3>Speaking of "Bigamy"</h3>
<p>— Fire</p>
<p>"Bigamy" is not only a success of the director's skills, not only the beautiful light of the photography, but also the superior contribution of each actor's expression. It is undoubtedly a super special work in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Lao Gao and Xiao Gao are a happy couple here. Xiao Gao plays a feudal woman in an old-fashioned family, and Lao Gao is the opposite of her. He is a modern college student who likes romance. Under this conflict of new and old ideas, all kinds of tragedies are caused. Lao Gao was imprisoned for bigamy and abandonment. The compensation for the loss and the burden of alimony bankrupted the entire family. We can see many soulless bodies wriggling and many painful shadows crawling. The director is Wu Cun, the director of "Wind," who once caused a sensation in the Chinese film industry. Under the destruction of four pairs of scissors, we cannot fully reveal it. This time in "Bigamy," we can see the director's "true face of Mount Lu." (sic)</p>

<p>Small Movie Talk</p>
<h3>Mother-Daughter Relationship (Lady by Choice) (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhongjia</p>
<p>The judge listened to the singing man's statement of his case, suppressing his laughter. In his heart, he wished he was there to see Pansy drunk and angrily beat the singer. But he dared not let Pansy know his joy, she had already been too presumptuous. So he sternly said to Pansy, "Why did you hit him?" Pansy put her hands on her waist and shouted with wide eyes, "Why? He was singing a mother's song!" Suddenly, there was a burst of laughter in the back of the courtroom, and the sound of small hands clapping. Judge Daley looked up and looked over to the place where the clapping was coming from, and he couldn't help but clench his lips. What he saw was a young woman wearing a loose fur coat and holding a large ostrich feather fan in one hand. How could he not recognize her? All the city's tabloids had published her photos, everyone had heard her name, and everyone had read her news. She was Ala Baneley, the feather fan dancer who caused a sensation in New York. Next to her was her stage manager, Kendall, and a policeman. Her publicist, Froote, followed behind. When Judge Daley was looking at Ala Baneley, Ala Baneley was still laughing at Pansy. Perhaps Ala Baneley heard Pansy's aversion to mother's songs and expressed sympathy to her. Or perhaps she felt that Pansy was a sketch of her old age. She felt that Pansy must have been as straightforward, quick-tempered, and intolerant of hypocrisy as she was when she was young. She also saw that Pansy must have been as beautiful and charming as she was when she was young, because her eyes, although old, still had a green afterglow. Her loose, disheveled hair must have been as golden as pure gold at first. Her mouth, although the corners had been pulled down by the years and wind and frost, must have been very moving in the past. She thought and couldn't help but feel scared. If she got old, she would definitely become like Pansy, unless Heaven had some special magic to stop that change. In the future, men would gradually restrain their smiles when they saw her. Or what she is drinking to refresh herself now will become her daily food in the future. Or she would be hungry and cold and wander around. Ala Baneley looked at Pansy as if she were looking at a mirror, reflecting her future vividly, and couldn't help but shudder. But while she was daydreaming, Pansy was also smiling at her. So she couldn't help but clap her hands and laugh again. Judge Daley was furious when he heard this, banged the gavel on the table, and shouted, "Silence!" His eyes glared fiercely at Ala Baneley, and then he asked Pansy again, "Why can't he sing mother's songs?" When the judge asked Pansy, she couldn't help but become furious again. All she heard was her shouting, "This shameless thing, his mother often beat her when she was alive. A year ago, he abandoned his wife and three children. So when he sang the line "Mother's warm and kind light shines from her eyes," I couldn't help but jump up and want to stab him. Judge, you would too, wouldn't you?" The judge pondered in his heart that it was no wonder Pansy. Strange Pansy... Poor Pansy, she has a loyal heart, but she is inevitably accused by others. Or his previous pity for her and releasing her was a misuse of leniency, which harmed her instead. This old woman really can't take care of herself. It would be best to find a safe place for her where she can have food to eat every day, a bath to wash every day, and a pillow to rest her head on and a blanket to cover her body every night. So he sternly rebuked, "Do you know how many times you've been here in a year?" Pansy did not answer. The judge calculated for her, "Seven times, isn't it? The last time I released you, you promised me that you wouldn't drink a drop of alcohol again. You've said many times that you wouldn't drink alcohol again. Now you're causing trouble again because of drinking!" (To be continued)</p>
