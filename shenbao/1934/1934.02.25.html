<p>藝術人才的合作</p>
<h3 id="c1">技術水凖的提高 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>過去：從一九三二年十月十三日，到一九三三年三月，經過多少經濟上的困難（草創時代的藝華公司，祗有三間矮屋，一片空坪，這時誰也不來注意。）人事上的變故，「民族生存」終於攝完最後一景，接着「肉搏」也以三月餘的工夫告一結束。嚴春堂氏鑒於兩片成績尙佳，况在百業蕭條之際，國産電影獨有欣欣向榮之象，乃决心改「藝華影片公司」爲「藝華影業有限公司」，積極收買廣大地基，建築宏偉攝影場，改革公司組織，羅致電影界藝術界新舊人才，樹立三年出片計劃，等等，未出三月，公司氣象煥然一新，而「烈熖」與「中國海的怒潮」也就在比較舒適的環境中製作着了。　　不多時，公司當局默察現有之製作技術尙難逹到中國電影界已經逹到之水準，在某次嚴春堂氏之招宴席上，酒酣耳熱，各人不覺發憤，願以所長貢獻於公司改組後之第一片，卜萬蒼氏客串導演，但杜宇氏收音並攝影、金𦦨高占非諸氏客中主演等，就�</p>
<p>因之成爲「黃金時代」攝製計劃的開端，而後來卜萬蒼氏脫離原屬公司，正式就職於本公司，接着周克方沛霖諸氏相繼訂約，但杜宇應雲衛甚至連同史東山鄭應時諸氏都歸納到一條戰線上來，就形成現下本公司的堂堂陣容。</p>
<p>現在：回溯一年以前艱苦備嘗的創業時代，現在，可算是規模具備了。在製作中和將開始製作中，有四片，「黃金時代」「女人」「飛花村」「生活」。而計劃中已在籌備的新片，另有八部至十二部、至少，我們想，在毎一年中，有十二部至十六部的出品。</p>
<p>將來：險阻艱難，不僅成事所必遇，也是人生常有的歷程，我們决没有一點灰心仍力求藝術人才的合作，技術水準的提高，以輔助國片運動之發展，進而與外國影片爭一日之短長，這也是本公司日夜孜孜的最大目的，同時我們又只信仰以事實來回答影界同業與社會人士殷殷的責望，埋頭苦幹，百折不撓，深盼各界人士愛護此新生的蓓蕾，而加以灌溉，那不僅是本公司之幸，也是整個民族整個國家之幸。</p>

<h3 id="c27">白銀恊定問題　果· <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>近據海外電訊。美國政府頗有意是高銀價。重行鼓鑄銀幣。尤以白銀派議員持之甚力。現此案正在參院銀行貨幣委員會考慮中。本埠銀行業以銀價之變動。於吾國有極重大關係。特於本月二十日以上海銀行業同業公會名義。致電美總統羅斯福。請加以愼重考慮。同時復致電南京政府。請暫緩批准倫敦白銀恊定。於是久歸沈寂之白銀問題。復有突呈嚴重之現象焉。</p>
<p>夫美國白銀問題之根本癥結。表面固由於白銀派議員之推動。實則爲美國抬高銀價。開闢遠東市塲。以排斥英日兩國勢力之一貫方針。蓋遠東各地人民。用銀習慣。由來已舊英日勢力之發展。方興未艾。羅斯福政府爲推銷美國商品起見。自惟有抬高銀價之一法。銀價高則美貨易於流入中國。從而英日兩國之勢力。必受相當之打擊。羅斯福政府所自信者固如此也。一九三三年倫敦白銀恊定之成立。不過爲美國囤銀政策之發端。自倫敦白銀恊定成立而後。美國之囤金政策。與囤銀政策。幾有同時並進之勢。此觀於一九三三年十二月二十一日批准倫敦恊定與今年一月收回全國黃金之法令而可知。總之美國抬高銀價之政策。早有勢在必行之表示矣。</p>
<p>倫敦恊定之締約國就産銀國方面言。以美國與墨西哥所處之地位爲最重要。美國年須收買二千四百萬盎士。墨則年須收買七百萬盎士。就用銀國方面言。以印度與西班牙所處之地位爲最重要。印度年售銀不得逾三千五百萬盎士。西班牙年售銀不得逾五百萬盎士。以上四國之中。除西班牙是否贊同未有所聞外。餘均已先後於去年十一月二十一日後將恊定批准公布。據此則重要産銀國與售銀國。俱不得自由供給銀貨於世界市塲。然論其實際。中國卽不批准該約。而美國仍可有大量囤銀之自由。以實現其抬高銀價之目的。故就目前形勢而論。吾以締約國之地位。而謂能以不批准該約手段。卽可收阻止美國囤銀行動之效力。無是理也。</p>
<p>雖然。美國抬高銀價之政策。旣爲經濟恐慌中爭奪市塲之必然趨勢。則銀價之高漲。當然旦夕可期。而其影響之及於吾國者。固甚重大。且其利害關係。亦甚複雜。非經集合多數專家。詳細討論。不易得其結論也。此問題容當續論之。</p>

<p>和平前途荊棘叢生</p>
<p>戰爭準備實事求是</p>
<p>歐洲大陸陰雲密佈、太平洋上時聚妖氛、實際的情形、固然未至極端的緊張、就是淺近的看法、任何國家都不敢輕於挑衅、何况經濟恐慌的情勢并未眞正好轉、失業工人數目、雖然稍微减少、但還算不得渡過了難關、因此牠們自身各有所顧忌、不敢發動武力鬭爭以自走絶路、但是對於軍備則緊緊的把握着、大有回復一九一四年以前武裝和平的形勢、論美國的與論界和一般人民的傾向、都集其全力於産業復興·和恐慌的克服、但是製造能力已行高度化了的美國、單靠國内的消費市塲是萬難擴大的、卽令如牠從前所劃定的範圍、實行門羅主義、將南美諸國與夫加拿大一齊劃進門羅主義圈内、也還是有種種問題、美國和英國的對立日益尖銳、換言之、就是美國在外市塲要受限制、還有是在太平洋彼岸的大市場、那裏的人民對美國旣表示好感的居多、商塲也差不多還是有待於開拓、特别是重工業的製造品、更須讓美國獨步、</p>
<p>所可惜的是美國在遠東的經濟佈置還在凖備期中、就投資的實數而論、也遠在英日兩國之後、因此牠不能不急起直追、圖執遠東市場的牛耳、然而要維持牠投資的安全、保障海航平安的現有武力、豈但是不够而且處於劣敗地位、假定在平時還可以用金圓勢力支配一切、而戰事爆發後、美國欲維持其超然的中立態度、也覺着會有困難、所以牠在産業復興期中、努力從事於軍需要業的擴張、如海軍建艦計劃、卽其最明顯的例子、何况現</p>
<p>世界各國都竭力充實軍備、特别是擴張空軍的事更見熱鬧、美國事事都想在世界上占第一位、然而空軍竟次於法蘭西、現在且將屈居蘇聯之次、在美國人的眼中、這是何等的難堪、同時也是一件危險事、</p>
<p>本年一月二十七日、陸軍部發表擴張空軍的五年計劃、要將陸軍航空隊的力量增加百分之七十、該計劃案已經參衆兩院審查、同時衆議院海軍委員會、也正在審查海軍擴張航空隊的計劃、將增加飛機百分之六十六、（原有飛機約千架、今後將增加到一千六百六十架、）像這様的海陸空三軍互相呼應之下、於是美國空軍將一舉而躍居世界第一、在戰鬭能率上、也想取得世界上最高最大的實力、現在將原提案的大意、摘譯如下、</p>
<p>一、現在美國陸軍航空機限於一千八百架、而實際的數目則不及一千七百架、并且這一千七百架飛機中有很多是機器腐舊了、如果要實行參加戰爭、竟是不可能的事、所以現時空軍必須從根本上加以改編、須建造最新式的飛機一千架、以便應付萬一事變、</p>
<p>二、飛機數旣然增加、則正規的飛行將校士兵都須得以次增加、所以要增加飛機將校四百人、航空兵士六千二百人、</p>
<p>三、新設立「中央航空圑」、（CentrelAirUnit）把陸軍方面與航空有關係的兵科都網羅在一起、務使組織完密、使該圑在非常時期能適用於緊急的活動、同時這又是與海軍航空隊相聯絡的機關、保持陸海軍的適當聯繫、</p>
<p>這個提案、又說到美國的航空兵力、飛機一千八百架、對海外屬領地、尤其是菲列濱與關島兩上處、無法分配、其所必要的飛行隊、卽國内有效的防衛、也很覺着薄弱、果如提案所示實行擴張之後、大概就可以安全無虞罷、（一九三四年一月三十日）</p>

<p>我們這一次應廣西省政府之約、赴桂調查全省經濟狀况、爲時計六閱月、蒙該省當局殷殷招待、深可銘感、所得材料、現正在整理中、不日當有廣西經濟調查報告書提出、由社會調查所正式發表、茲僅就途中見聞所及、與個人此行之觀感、握管記之、以供留心桂省建設問題者之參考、」</p>
<p>廣西是西南邊陲的一個省份、面積八萬四千餘英里人口約一千二百萬、因其西南隅、與法屬安南相毘連、故在國防上占一很重要的地位、惟以地處蠻僻、交通阻梗、無論就牠的經濟上或文化上來說、自然要比江浙諸省爲落後、但自二十年兩廣合作後、該省當局諸人、能在軍事瘡痍之餘、殷殷圖治、努力建設、在短期間内、成績斐在、一時「新廣西」之稱、譽滿全國、而桂省之經濟、政治、建設諸端、变漸爲國人所注意、我們這次承該省當局之約、作一全省之經濟調查、以供桂省將來經濟建設之參考、同人等一則素慕桂林山水、有甲天下之稱、再則覺得像這様的一個新的省分、去觀光一下、也是値得的、遂欣然奉命、决定去年的七月初自北平動身、在出發以前、我們就着手調查前之種種凖備、如搜集各種報章雜誌上關於廣西政治經濟問題的記載、蒐羅各學術機關經濟調查的表格、同行的爲吳半農韓德章兩先生、和我三個人、我因爲有些私事要回浙江故鄉去一趟、所以於六月二十日卽自北平啓程、在武義住一禮拜、七月五日回到上海、恰巧這時吳韓兩君、也自平來滬了、我們在上海與廣西駐滬代表黃建屏先生接洽後、隨卽購定了七月十四日開行的意郵「康梯浮地」號船票、該船搭往香港的票價二等艙爲九十七元六毛、同時黃建屏先生、卽把我們的行程電告李白黃三公、吳韓兩君在南京聽到張心一先生說、桂省氣候溫炎、且多時疫瘴氣、爲妨患未然計、所以我們在離滬之前、就打了霍亂傷寒的預防針、又購置了大批的藥品、如金雞納霜·十滴水·濟衆水·之類的東西、諸事摒擋就緖後、我們就於十四日上午九時上船、下午一時船員浦東碼頭開行、當她鼓着浪離開了這繁華緊張的都市時、我們的心靈裏感到異常的輕鬆、但一想到她載着我們向離北平更遠的方向走去、又有些惆悵了、意郵在歐亞航綫上、算是後起之秀、尤其是康梯浮地的二等艙、據說原是頭等艙之一部分、特爲備「高等華人」之乘坐而劃出來的、故艙房雅潔、佈置舒適、Saloon尤爲富麗堂皇、待上船後、我們纔知道還有二等經濟艙(2ndClass,Economy)、到香港祇要六十塊</p>
<p>這次没有買經濟艙、實在有些大資産階級化了、在船上</p>
<p>承張先生介紹我們認識了現在廣西敎育廳長雷賓南氏、雷君是我國敎育界知名的平民敎育家、同時双是革命界的老前輩、在SmokingRoom裏、他和我們痛論中匣國敎育制度的缺點、結果祇養成了一批不與社會生産發生關係的高等游民、這次廣西最高當局、本約雷君去長敎育廳的、但他自已的計劃、則想回廣西去創辦一個國民生産敎育學院、（名稱未定）、雷君對我們的經濟調查工作、表示熱烈的歡迎、因爲當去年廣西第一次行政會議開會時、他就首次提議廣西應成立一個經濟委員會、委員會的初步工作、便是實地調查、然後根據調查材料、作全省經濟建設之計劃、所以我們這一行、沿途以及抵桂後、所得到雷君的帮忙和指示、實不在鮮、</p>
<p>船上的光陰、就在談話或遠眺中很快的消逝過去了、第二天下午五點鐘、二等Saloon裏、還有音樂、據同行的韓德章君（精於音律）說、所奏的如Suauss的EnjoyLifeVerde　Ajda,</p>
<p>Moskowsky的SpanishDances、都是名曲、但可惜我是個道地的門我漢、眞無異於「對牛彈琴」、晚上九時、又有有聲電影、片名TerraMadre(MotberEarth)、不過片子旣不高明、所說的話、又是意大利語、劇情不能了了、演未終塲、我們就回到房裏來睡覺了、一宿醒來、盥洗旣畢、略將行裝整理了一下、香港已經隱隱約約可以看得見了、我們以前讀過魯迅所寫的過港經騐談、知道香港上岸時、專有檢查華人行李的高等國民、如果不把錢賄賂他們、就許把你的箱　翻江搗海、或戳得個七孔八穿的、我們這一次所帶的行李比較的多、中心不無惴惴、所以預先就打聽好了毎件行李得孝敬檢查員多少禮、免得臨時無所措手足、這時黃憲儒先生告訴我們、如果行李太多了、也有一個辦法、可以避免檢查員的麻煩、那就是讓一位去香港酒店HongkongHotel住一晚、因香港酒店接客的茶房是碧眼兒、祇消把行李交給他、就可以不受檢查、因向來檢查、是僅施之於同胞的、這倒眞是一個取巧的辦法、但我們却因爲早就决定住皇后酒店、兼之香港酒店的房金太昻、分開了住、也不方便、所以並没有那様做、到正午十二點鐘、船靠了皇家碼頭、這時就有大批苦力（碼頭夫）蜂擁而入、其勢洶洶、若臨戰塲、我們三人都不能粤語、幸虧雷賓南先生來招呼我們、費了好多唇舌、什麽檢查行李費、苦力搬運費、總共化了六元多錢、終算把行李安然搬到皇后酒店、房間看定後、就持黃建屏先生的介紹函、去香港廣西銀行看正副經理曾其新張兆棠兩君、那知剛巧今天是星期、銀行停止辦公、等了好久、終算把張副經理請到了、但張君對我們此行之任務、似乎並不了了、祇說、「李總司令也在香港、諸位要不要去會他、」我們當然要會會李先生的、於是就托張君與李先生約定了一個時間、夜裏以電話通知我們、從廣西銀行出來、我們就去看敝行同事陳君慧无生介紹我們的一位朋友李灃先生、李先生是永咖啡公司的司理（香港稱經理爲司理）、招待我們、非常誠懇、他說第二天適是他們公司進貨的日期、抽不出時間來陪我們、所以想委托一個靑年會的朋友劉君、來做我們遊香港的嚮導、回到旅館後、夜裏我們接到張經理的電話、說已約定了明晨七點鐘、李先生在家候着我們、</p>
<p>在皇后酒店、發生了一件有趣的事、當晚上八九點鐘、有一個茶役跑進來問我們一個同事、要不要抽大烟、我們的同事摇摇頭、他悵悵的地走了、過一會、他又把頭探進來了、我們問他幹什麽、他說、先生們要呌姑娘解悶否、我們再又給他一個軟釘子碰、從此茶房的呼應也不靈、招待也簡慢了、我們自然也只得聽之、香港旅館的情形、也可想見一般了、</p>

<h3 id="c136">宋子文談白銀協定 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>穩定銀價與現在情形相同</p>
<p>减少美棉定貨現正在磋商</p>
<p>全國經濟會常務委員宋子文氏、昨晨在西愛咸斯路經濟委員會辦事處内、接見各報社記者、對白銀等各問題、發表重要談話、謂銀恊定并不違背社會心理、并表示本人將於下週入京、下月擬與戴季陶同赴西北、至美棉麥借欵、將於可能範圍内减少棉部份借欵數目、茲分誌宋氏談話於次、</p>
<p>情勢心理變遷甚速　關於白銀問題、宋氏謂、在此三數年中、其價格漲落、波折甚大、在三四年前、其低落情形最甚、蓋當時一般人之心理、以爲白銀在國際間已被抛棄、而無出路、乃溢入中國、故當時有一部份人主張禁銀入口、最近銀價又有增高之趨勢、於是又有一部份人、主張禁銀出口、前後情形、完全相反、恐現在之主張禁銀出口之最激烈者、或亦卽以前主張禁止白銀入口之最烈者也、情勢與心理、變遷之速、有如此者、</p>
<p>白銀恊定簽訂由來　　至於倫敦銀恊定之目的、在穩定銀價、計已爲國人所共知、數年前、銀價暴跌之最大原因、爲印度放棄銀本位、而以鉅額之銀、向國際市塲賣出、據去年統計、印度取銷銀本位、尙保有白銀四萬萬盎斯、同時西班牙亦有大量白銀、流通市塲、故銀恊定中、規定印度·西班牙·及其他自銀本位改金本位之國家、毎年售出白銀、不得超過三千五百萬盎斯、同時産銀國如墨西哥·美國·加拿大·毎年各由國庫收買白銀三千五百萬盎斯·而中國亦不能將政府國庫中所貯之銀向市塲售出、以求白銀供應得以平衡、而銀價趨於穩定、現在社會上一般人之心理、希望我國現銀不至流出、倫敦銀恊定、卽本此義、故與社會心理、並無違背之處、</p>
<p>如何對策不願批評　　至中國所有之銀、爲數亦不多、除中央銀行所保存之硬貨外、更無所謂國庫白銀、恊定中所指、爲後日或我國改用金本位後、白銀過剩、將向國外流出耳、至最近美國重鑄銀幣及銀行界之表示、將來如何對策、則政府自有主管機關决定大策、本人爲前任財長、因地位關係、雅不願加以任何批評及推測、</p>
<p>前頒徵收銀税目的　至徵收白銀出口税問題、宋氏僅稱、以前所頒銀出口徵税百分之二·二五、其目的純爲廢兩改元後、國定銀本位幣、其價値於純銀成分外、加鑄費百分之二·二五、外商不願使用銀幣、而仍用銀兩、因銀兩無鑄費負擔、比較上合算、故規定銀兩出口徵税、銀幣則免、以劃一其價値、使國幣暢通、幣制統一、並無限制銀出口之意義在内、</p>
<p>美棉定額磋商减少　嗣記者詢以美棉麥借欵、合同中美棉爲四千萬美金、聞運到我國者、僅六百餘萬金元、餘額尙有三千餘萬元之鉅、我國市况、殊無此鉅大之購買力、原借欵合同、究竟如何修改、宋氏答稱、在去年簽訂借欵合同時、我國紗廠業對美棉之需要量甚多、後因去年我國棉産豐收、外棉需要量大减、致未能照約購進、現正在美商量、减少數量、其詳細數目、尙在磋商中、大約以我國市塲之需要量爲凖則、記者又以棉額减少後、是否將用以購買他種貨物爲問、宋氏對之未置答、</p>
<p>下週入京將往西北　宋氏繼稱、關於全國經濟委員會事業費之分配、余前次赴杭、與將先生已詳細交換意見、下星期余卽晋京、與汪精衛孫哲生孔庸之三先生再事談商、卽可决定、在西北陜甘各省、經濟委員會正擬從事開發水利興築公路等建設事業、余最近想往陜甘一視其經濟情形、以爲從事經濟建設之根據、考試院長戴季陶先生、對開發西北甚爲熱心、擬於下月中、與之同行、視察陜甘後、尙擬往四川一行、以川陜各省區、於今後復興我國之經濟建設上、均佔重要地位也、</p>
<h3 id="c137">美提高銀價後應否徵出口税 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>滬金融界亦不一致</p>
<p>主持徵税者　　中央社記者、以美政府將重鑄銀幣、設法提高銀價、與我國之利害關係甚鉅、昨晨、特向本埠金融界探悉銀價提高後、我國將感受之利害如下、我國爲銀本位國、銀價提高、於無形之間、我國財産數量、亦隨之增加、此爲必然之趨勢、且我國積欠外債數目甚鉅、償付外債之時、銀價貴賤、於兌換之間、相差甚鉅、此爲提高銀價後、我國所能感受之利益、其他如銀價提高後、我國商人、能利用此良好時機、競將國貨外銷、則所得利益、亦非淺鮮、至其爲害、則百倍於此、銀價提高後、現銀之外流、勢所必然、且無法足以禁止、上海銀行界、自美政府宣稱、</p>
<p>設法提商銀價後、卽電逹美總統羅斯福陳述意見、現未得復、但料美府之此項計劃、似在必行、滬銀行界之一紙電文、或恐無滬於事、所以當今要務、當計劃美政府一旦實行提高銀價後、將用何法以制止國内現銀之外輸、則舍徵收現銀出口税外、實無他法也、至税率这規定、當隨時增减、例如銀價增加至百分之二十、則阁税率亦必增至百分之二十、俾運銀者無利可圖、並須規定處罰私運現銀出口者以極刑、然恐尙不能完全禁止現銀之輸出也、蓋我國係入超國家、訂購外貨、非現銀不可、至於有人謂、銀價提高後、國内物價亦可提高、此則適足以自害、因中國國内、經濟恐慌、逹於極點、購買力薄弱、致存貨山積、而農村經濟之衰落、亟等救濟、提高物價、則國内各業、更將陷於窘迫狀態中矣、</p>
<p>懷疑徵税者　　新聲社云、自本市銀行界對美國提高銀價政策表示反對後、各方態度除政府當局表示考慮外、其餘亦均有意見發表、新聲社記者、昨復據銀行某君謂、美總統羅斯福提高銀價之目的、實爲復興計劃救濟失業政策之一、故滬銀行界反對、僅祇表示我國態度、以促其注意而已、若謂因此一電、而能使美國變換其政策、事實上無此可能性、故美總統在國會中、已多數贊成實行該項政策、在此情勢之下、對我國銀地界之電文、自未便表示態度、故羅氏似不致有覆電矣、至於我國自處對策、或有主張徵白銀出口税以示抵制者、但銀之本身、隨時隨市價上下、初無一定、故决不能同於其他徵收辦法、厘訂徵收率爲百分之幾、故縱或有實施之可能性、實非經過詳細之研究不可、蓋其困難在複雜也、惟以美之提高銀價而論、我國所蒙影響、亦本必十分深重、蓋我國最大缺點、厥惟生産落後、美之提高銀價、在抑其貨價、以求其過剩生産之出路、我國向爲出超之國家、以貨易貨、現銀更何從流出、奈年來卽以僅有之絲荼兩大宗出口、亦已一蹶不振、故今後唯一補救之道、惟冀政治安定、力謀增加生産耳、</p>

<p>統税倍征水泥深受影響</p>
<p>再懇收回成命以卹艱危</p>
<p>全國水泥廠聯合會、以自統税加征後、營業備受影響、前曾呈請税署、將加征後之所墊税欵、設法予以取消、惟税署以事關通案、批斥不准、聯合會方面、昨又呈請税署臚述商艱情形、懇請設法補救、原呈如下、呈爲統税倍徵、國産水泥深受影響、敬再縷陳意見、仍懇俯賜採納、俾資救濟事、案查屬會前以統税税率、奉令加倍徵收、對於國産民生、損害奇重、爰經呈請鈞署轉懇收回成命、以恤艱危、茲奉鈞批第一八九號内開（中略）等因奉此、查我國水泥工業、尙在幼稚時代、除通商巨埠外、行銷本屬有限、比以</p>
<p>時局多故民生困窮　一切建築、率多停滯、用是水泥銷數、尤受影響、各廠出品、莫不供過於求、此次增改税率、雖所增税欵、係由消費者負繳納義務、有如鈞批所云、特用户方面、以負担激增、除萬不得已之用途外、必得别謀替代、則水泥銷數之益見屯滯、自在意中、乃呈懇收回成命一節、竟不獲請、奉批之下、採用徬徨、屬會亦知政府此次增改税率、容非得已、苟非多所窒碍、甚願勉爲其難、顧重税之影響行銷、旣如前述、行銷愈滯、成本愈昻、將使各廠營業愈難維持、卽實業民生前途愈形危險、設不請求政府别籌救濟、弊害所至、將不忍言、屬會心所謂危、敢將呈請救濟意見、分陳如次、</p>

<p>係分存堆棧、或運處分銷、並非立時出售、而税欵則須先行繳納、卽客</p>
<p>户承購之貨、亦因放帳關係、其應繳統税、均由各公司先行墊繳、增税以後、墊欵益鉅、各公司周轉殊感困難、此次鈞批以完納統税、本有記帳辦法、如果各廠商能覓銀行担保、自可准予記帳、當不至受先墊統税之困難爲言、仰見鈞署體念商艱、實深感荷、惟查向來記帳辦法、限制綦嚴、所有記帳税欵、限於毎月二十五日必須繳淸、而按之實際情形、各公司墊付税欵、至早須於二三個月後、方得向各客户陸續收回、其因分存堆棧、或運交分銷待售之貨、則須以市面爲轉移、故墊欵之收回、爲期尤遠、是雖有記帳辦法、而各公司仍不能免除先墊税欵之困難、敢請將記帳期限、展長爲三個月、俾各公司得以稍輕</p>

<p>退還重税辦法修訂　查已完納税之水泥、運銷施行統税區域内、不得重征其他一切税捐、在統税條例及水泥統税稽徵章程中、均有明文規定、但粤省對於入境水泥、毎桶須重徵大學捐九角、電話捐四角五分、兩共一元三角五分、較之最近修訂之統税税率、毎桶面超過一角五分、且有中央此次加税之後、粤省聞將接踵增加、至該省西村等廠所産水泥、並不徵捐、長此以往、屬會公司之在粤銷數、必至完全斷絶、前經屬會疊呈籲懇糾正、以均負担、雖奉財政部税字一六九七號批示、得將原征統税、如數退還、認爲在廠商方面、實際上並無若何損失、但粤省重征欵項與原征實税、數額懸殊苟非按照、</p>

<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>據友人說：讀書指導是專爲申報流通圖書館的讀者們所設置，其指導範圍也僅限於該圖書館的讀者們的，果如所言，不知對於我這個淪落天涯的窮小子，亦能賜予特别通融，而加以指敎否？先主！我是非常的切迫地在祈求着！我誠懇地祈求先生以有敎無類的精神，不遺在遠地來醫治我們這些文盲，來拯救我們這些孤苦無告的靑年！</p>
<p>我是一個洋服工人、現在此間｜｜日本｜一家華商的洋服商店裏充當夥計。（此間洋服商店多半爲華人所開設）我幼小的時候、在鄉間私塾裏讀過一些「百家姓」「千字文」「幼學瓊林」以及一孝經一之類的書、爲時約三年左右，後來因爲家庭實在培植不起，祇得把我送進杭州一家織布廠裏充當學徒、所謂學徒、事實上學的並非織布技術而是替帳房先生換水烟袋，打掃屋子，泡茶，開飯，倒便壼捉臭蟲等勾當。這様的鬼混子二年多，結果因爲一塲大病，又回到飢餓的家裏。因爲我身體不好，母親呌我習較輕鬆的手藝，裁縫祇要鎭日價的坐着引綫穿針，而且文縐縐的可以穿着長衫、這眞是我母親眼光中最理想最高貴的好職業了。而我的命運，我的靑年，便被縫於那些豪紳富賈公子王孫們衣裳的針孔中了，我手中的尺，也無從測量我自已渺茫的前途。所謂幸福，所謂快樂是已被那剪刀剪斷，，被粉綫彈去了。</p>
<p>先生！你以爲上面所寫的是廢話麽？不，這正足以證明像我這様的人，在在皆是，無論是窮鄉僻壤，無論是海角天涯。所以我希望先生的工作，不要僅以上海一隅之店員工人以及靑年失學者爲對象，</p>
<p>現在請爲先生一陳述我寫這信的主要意思、我過去也正如責刋何常君信中所言、（見本月一日報）亦是沉淪於低級趣味裏鴛鴦蝴蝶派等小說中之一份子，可是近年來，我轉向了，我覺得這些有害我的腸胃，我已要改換一些營養的東西，來解决我的饑荒。現在我要請先生指敎的，便是這新糧食中的我所不能消化的一部。</p>
<p>我近來很喜歡看社會科學的書籍，尤注意閱報，對於報上所載的國際消息，可以說是一字不遺都要閱讀一遍的。我對於國際政局之變遷，以及各個國家之組織制度，各個政黨之主張，已日漸明瞭。但現在我所莫名其妙的，便是經濟方面之新聞，什麽「貨幣戰爭」「貨幣恊定」「美元貶價」「美國收買黃金」「滙兌安定保證」「金解禁」「金輸出」「黃金政策」等之形形色色名詞、我都不能很澈底的了解。先生！這些問題，有無通俗的說明書籍可以購閱？或者，要怎様我才能獲得關於這方面的基礎知識，克服我現在這個不了解的困難？左列諸書有無能帮助我解决前面的困難？這些，都請先生明以敎我！</p>
<p>（一）金貴銀賤問題之研究，（二）貨幣概論，（三世界貨幣問題、（四）銀價之研究，（五）貨幣學ＡＢＣ，（六）金貴銀賤問題之討論，（七）金之問題，（八）世界經濟會議，（九）銀問題，（見圖書館目錄）先生，關於前面我所舉的問題，我不但是單純的不了解，而且我簡直不明白於國計民生究竟有何關係？其變動由何人所操縱，我眞是一點也不懂得、先生你不會笑我太幼稚吧？</p>
<p>此外我想系統的研究經濟學，請先生費神由淺入深替我開張書目，我想憑着先生替我開的單方，一定可以使我造成一個健强的體格，我謹以最誠摯的熱心掬於先生之前，</p>

<p>小朋友：你們的校訓是什麽？有没有這「親愛精神」四個字？你們對於師長親愛嗎？對於同學有没有親愛精神？</p>
<p>外國人說：我們中國人像散沙一般没有親愛精神，所以外國侵略我國領土的時候、我們不能一致圑結起來去抵抗，甚而有時還要自已家裏打起來。這就是没有親愛精神的原故。</p>
<p>小朋友：你們對於父，母，兄，弟，姊，妹，師長，同學固然要有親愛精神，而對於社會上毎一個中國人，都要有親愛精神，我們把這偉大的親愛精神圑結起來，我們的國家有了整個很大的力量，外國還敢來欺侮我們嗎？還敢譏笑我們是一盤散沙般的民族嗎？我們中國還怕不强嗎？</p>

<p>玲玲已經七歲了。伊母親替伊選定了一間學校，便送伊去入學。可是伊聽見要去讀書的消息，便大哭起來。雖然伊的母親幾次三番的勸誡，可是玲玲總不願進學校。伊說：「讀書没有像遊玩那様有趣味。</p>
<p>一天早晨，伊偸偸地溜出學校的門口，在路上遇見一隻大松鼠。伊向松鼠說：「你眞快樂呀！吃吃胡桃，喝喝淸水、多麽自由啊！我願和你一塊兒遊玩，做永久的伴侶。」松鼠回答道：「我没有工夫，我要替孩子們尋找吃的東西，我必須做工，那裏有時間玩耍呢？」玲玲只得去找别的東西玩，伊又遇見了螞蟻，伊說：「螞蟻哥哥呀！你來和我玩一會吧！」螞蟻摇着頭說：「我那有空間、我如果不做工，那裏能够生活呢？」玲玲便去找蜜蜂。伊對蜜蜂語：「你好快活呀！一天到晚唱唱歌，飛來飛去，看看風景，我們做個遊戲的朋友吧？」蜜蜂說：「眞抱歉，請你另外去找朋友吧！我要做工，才能過冬，玩耍是没有閒空啊！」</p>
<p>玲玲想：這些動物，都要做工，讓我來找花兒去玩，它們是整天閒着没有事做的。伊就走到一棵小紅花面前對它說：「小紅花！我想你整天閒着，不須做工，和我玩一會吧。」小紅花說：「我的工作很忙，毎天要開放花瓣、吸收陽光和空氣，這須用根在泥土中尋找食物，再用枝條把它分送養料到全身的各部份去，那裏會有閒空的工夫呢？」</p>
<p>玲玲聽了花兒的話，立刻回到母親那裏對母親說：「因親啊！世界上的動物，植物都有工作，我難道不如它們嗎？我也要做事呀！」母親拍着玲玲的肩膀說道：小寳寳！你不是也有工作嗎？上學校去讀書，就是你眼前的緊要工作呀！」玲玲聽了母親的話，從此很勤謹的上學去了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！開學的季節到了，你們間有逃學的嗎？讓他讀完這篇寓言，也許會變成一個能勤學的孩子了。</p>

<p>今天天氣很冷，吃過晚飯後，爸爸先聲明，今晚不出門，接着，媽媽也聲明，今晚不出門，於是我們就圍爐閒坐着。</p>
<p>我們是一共四個人，爸爸，媽媽，我，以及小妹妹。</p>
<p>爸爸老是看着我而笑着，我心裏想，他今天又要講故事了。</p>
<p>料不到，媽媽先發言，把這個好事打斷了：媽媽說：「去年是國貨年，今年是婦女國貨年，同時又是兒童年，去年是你的年，今年是我和慧兒的年」。</p>
<p>媽媽說了後，儘是望着爸爸而笑着，而爸爸也微笑着，我聽到「兒童年」這三個字，還是今天第一次，心中雖是不懂，但也快活得很，因爲媽媽說今年是我和伊的年。</p>
<p>爸爸說：「你的年，恐后怕得不到好結果，女人太虚榮，太要好看，倒是慧兒的年，來得可靠，我相信許多兒童，一定都是非常歡迎這個兒童年的到來的。」</p>
<p>這様一來，我是更加快活起來了。</p>
<p>接下去，媽媽又說：「你去年的這個年，成績又如何呢？」</p>
<p>爸爸聽了這句話後，没有講話，好似回答不出來的一般，媽媽好似很得意起來，像是打了勝仗的一般。</p>
<p>沈默了好多時候，我問媽媽說：「什麽呌做兒童年？」</p>
<p>媽媽回答我說：「兒童年的意思，在這一年中，更多做兒童的事情，要特别的多多帮助兒童，要出版許多兒童書籍　給兒童看，要多多改善兒童的生活，要是今年做得好，眞有成績的話，那末今年是你們最快活的年份了！」</p>

<p>貂在我國失地東三省地方，冬天的氣候，比較南部冷得多了，往往有行路的人，禁不起那様酷冷，就倒在路途上凍僵，由凍僵而凍死了。有種野獸，名字呌貂，它若是遇見路上有凍僵的人，就召集許許多多同類的貂來，遍覆在這凍僵人身上，因爲貂的身上溫度很高，常有凍僵的人得着溫暖，救活性命的，這種小動物，是何等慈愛；又何等聰明啊！但是有種捉貂的人，反利用這點，假裝着死，躺在路上，等着許多貂來救他的命，他便爬起來，把貂一一捉住，剝貂皮去賣錢。貂皮是很貴重的，雖然獲利，不過我覺得這種行爲，是欺騙的，是殘忍的，我眞要替貂抱着不平，如俗語說「好心没有好報」了！</p>
<p>狗歐洲有一種狗，在下大雪的時候，能救山上迷路的人，安安穩穩的下山，不致在山上凍死，又不致誤走着路，跌倒雪坑裏去，這種狗是山下的人養着的。當下大雪時，將一瓶酒繋在狗身上，狗就跑到山上去，將酒送到迷路的人面前，迷路的人飲了酒，自然覺得暖和些，可以抵抗冷氣，就能行動了。狗的記憶力最强，雖然是雪蓋了滿山滿谷，埋没路徑，但狗仍是分得出路來的，在前面引導着路，迷路的人跟着後面走，安然下了山來，否則，進退兩難，就要凍死了。</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>我家鄰居有一個孩子，他因爲性子很頑皮，有一次在沸水鍋的旁邊游戲，一個不留神，上半身跌在鍋子裏面·沸水把他燙了個半死。後來雖然經醫生醫治好了，但是他的兩隻手終於成爲殘廢了！</p>
<p>他毎天起床的時候，穿衣裳要别人給他穿；洗臉的時候要别人給他洗；吃飯的時候要别人給他喂；：：：他看見别的孩子能够攞方字，畫圖畫，做手工，：：：：這些事情在他自已都做不到；他一方面羨慕人家！一方面怨恨自已！他常常想；「我現在才知道有手的人的快樂了」。但他却永遠成爲一個殘廢的人！</p>
<p>小朋友們喲！你們看這個没有手的孩子可憐嗎？但是你們不能利用你們的雙手，和這個殘廢的孩子有甚麽兩様！</p>

<p>— 汪恒久</p>
<p>｜一筆畫｜</p>
<p>這是一種圖畫游戲，呌做「一筆畫」。上面四種爲動物，都是用一筆畫成的，諸位小朋友們，請不妨試試看，很是有趣的。</p>
<h3 id="c214">動物的笑容 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們人類的大凡逢到喜歡的時候，就表現了笑容。古來有一句話，說：「心得所好，口常欲笑」。動物也是同様的，動物在喜怒悲樂的時候，雖然没有像高等的人類笑哭等表情，就是有表情，我們人類的眼，是分不出來的。但是我們所常見的，也不過爲筋肉的緊張和弛緩的様子，譬如在愉快的時候，動物必定露出了牙齒。歡笑時的容姿。可有下列各種様子的表現，就是：（一）牙齒全部可以看見的，（二）嘴唇皮爲收歛的，（三）鼻頭要起皺紋的，（四）不知不覺的發出輕微的聲音，（五）眼睛潮濕？（六）形態輕快，毫無拘束等様子。如獅子虎豹等貓科猛獸，都是這様的。若是鳥類，那就呌出輕微的快樂聲了。普通鳥類的啼聲，大概啼高音的是唱歌，發低音的是表示所欲的意思。假使我們平日常常與禽獸接近，很可以分辨出來的。譬如喂食的時候，那禽獸自然很高興，就現出一種活潑潑的笑容，與同類相爭的時候，現在兇惡的怒容，恐被異類所害的時候，現出筋肉弛長發抖的悲容。</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>人類說話的聲音，只有在幾步以内可以聽到；兩個人一離開得遠，說話就廳不到了。但是人們不能不離開，亦不能不彼此傳逹消息，因此，我們的老祖宗很早就想出遠遠地招呼的方法了。石器時代的人類，相隔一條河或一個谷的時候，就摇手招呼（第一圖）。或者燒一堆火（第二圖）使對面的人知道這兒也有人在。後來，發明了烽火（第三圖），逢着敵人打進來的時候，就舉起亮亮的烽火，警告自已境内的人們，快些凖備。我們在歷史上，大概都讀過「周幽王烽火戲諸侯」這一段故事，從這段故事中，我們可以知道烽火是那時候唯一的傳逹消息的器具。十八世紀的時候，法國人創造了百葉窗式的傳逹消息器（第四圖），這東西豎立在高的地方，毎隔四五里就豎立一個。有六隻葉子，都可以自由啓閉，由於種種不同的啓閉方式，而表示出六十三種不同的記號來。這種通訊器後來有英人加以改良，變成像現代鐵路上的信號機一様的東西（第五圖）。他們在各處重要地點，豎立起這種信號機來，藉以傳逹軍事上的消息。可是在夜裏及霧天就完全失了作用。同時，在軍隊裏，軍士又用一種圓盤（第六圖）作爲傅逹消息的信號。十九世紀時又有日光返射信號機（第七圖）出現，牠利用日光在鏡子上返射出來的閃光，以傳遞消息。一八三七年美人莫爾士發明了有線電報。他的最初的電報機，是用針來指明號碼的（第八圖），其後逐漸改良，方成今日的様子（第九圖）。一八七七年英人倍爾發明了電話（第十圖）最後，馬可尼發明了無線電報（第十一圖），牠是現代傳通消息最便利的工具了</p>

<p>實施鄉土敎育以逹到民族敎育的目標</p>
<p>江蘇省敎育廳廳長周佛海告全省小學敎師、題爲「實施鄉土敎育以逹到民族敎育的目標、」原文如下、</p>
<p>各位敎師、在此外敵侵凌的時期、民族存亡的關頭、惟有敎育、才是我們的挽救方法、也惟有小學敎育、才是我們根本的挽救方法、所以我們的小學敎育、必須要加以重大的改革、而我們的小學敎師、更應當有深刻的覺悟、我國敎育宗旨、原以「充實人民生活、扶植社會生存、發展國民生計、廷續民族生命」爲目的、不過大凡一民族自有一民族的特殊環境、故一民族應有一民族的特殊敎育、然後方能發揚其民族的固有精神、延續其民族的生命、所以民族主義的敎育、便是敎育的基本、尤其是小學敎育的基本、因爲小學兒童、是民族的生命細胞、要有健全的細胞、方能有健全的生命、實行民族主義的小學敎育、便是要培養健全的民族生命細胞、而延續民族的永久生命、所以不吾國敎育宗旨上而言、民族主義的小學敎育、是我們目前急應切實施行的方針、况且我國民族的危機、决非短期所能解除而民族的鬥爭、尤應有長期的凖備、在長期凖備（</p>
<p>之中、應以民族主義的小學敎育、爲根本的凖備、而我國民族的最後勝負、更以民族主義小學敎育之成敗爲關鍵、試觀普法之役、普能勝法、日俄之戰、日能勝俄、世人皆歸功於普日的小學敎育、這是各位所熟知的、卽如辛亥革命、也因爲當年排滿的思想、久已灌輸於小學兒童的腦中、所以武昌起義、振臂一呼、淸明統治、遂告推翻、凡此例證、不勝列舉、所以就目前吾國民族環境而言、民族主義的小學敎育、更屬刻不容緩的要圖、返觀我國過去的小學敎育、也未嘗不以愛國救亡爲宗旨、也未嘗不以培養愛國思想爲目標、但是三十餘年來的結果、又果如何、一旦國難臨頭、在全體國民中、能自動犧牲救國者、究有幾人、次之而能眞正覺醒者、又有幾人、而替外敵殺同胞的漢奸、爲外人作走狗的洋奴、反比比皆是、這固然是我們認爲痛心的事情、同時也可以發見過去敎育的錯誤、因爲過去的敎育、雖有一定的方針、却忽視了實施的本末、祗有空漢的國家思想的灌輸、而没有深刻的鄉土愛情的培養、信念未立、基礎不固、一遇外物的誘惑、便起内心的動摇、所以漢奸洋奴、反多於愛國志士、於是過去的愛國敎育，遂告失敗、我們鑒於過去的錯誤、卽應謀切實的改正、所以民族主義敎育的實施、必須以鄉土敎育爲前提、然後方有堅實的基礎、因爲民族思想的養成、應以鄉土觀念爲基本、没有愛鄉觀念、民族思想、便等於幻象、没有鄉土敎育、國民敎育、便失了根源、遠行必始於近步、眞愛必發於切身、所以實施鄉土敎育、又爲實施民族敎育的先决要件、</p>
<p>鄉土敎育的任務、原在啓發兒童的鄉土認識、培養兒童的鄉土感情、然欲使其愛護鄉土、必先使其認識鄉土、所以啓發兒童的鄉土認識、又爲鄉土敎育的初步、啓發的方法、約有三端、第一應使兒童明瞭其鄉土的史乘古蹟偉人先哲、而對於鄉土的過去、能發生衷心的追慕、第二應使兒童熟悉其鄉土的地理物産風俗習慣經濟交通生活等現狀、而對於鄉土的現在、獲得眞切的認識、第三應使諳悉其鄉土之優、點與缺點而對於鄉土的將來、具有改革的理想、三者的認識、旣經明確、則鄉土的感情、自可油然而生、</p>
<p>至於鄉土與民族的關係、原屬全體與部份的關係、也就是互相依存的關係、旣有鄉土的認識、再加以相當的啓發、則易進而獲得民族的認識、旣有鄉土的愛情、再施以切實的訓導、則易進而發生民族的愛情、此種有機關係的聯貫、又爲鄉土敎育的職能、人類愛情、本屬由小而大、由近而遠、所以能了解鄉土者、必能了解民族、能愛護鄉土者、必能愛護民族、試觀我國歷代盜冠擾亂之際、若有少數人士、犠牲以衛護鄉土、則大局竟賴以保全、又如江南倭寇内犯、偶有忠義志士、犧牲以衛護鄉土、則民族竟藉免侵凌、可知直接能保衛鄉土者、聞接卽可以保全民族、直接愛護鄉土者、間接卽無異愛護民族、由此正足以證明民族思想、必以鄉土愛情爲基本、民族敎育應以鄉土敎育爲前提、</p>
<p>但是鄉土敎育的實施、决非封建思想的復活因爲我們所主張的鄉土敎育、係以民族主義爲目標、而三民主義的世界主義、又以民族主義爲基礎、所以鄉土敎育的性質、近而言之、是民族的基礎、遠而言之、也可以說是世界主義的起點、鄉土敎育的重要與迫切、旣如上述、因此本廳於去年所頒之小學敎育亟須改進之要點中、曾規定鄉土敎材之實施、現又令飭各縣敎育局組織鄉土敎材編纂委員會、以促其實現、故在此勵行鄉土敎育之際、對於諸君、實有左列數項的急切（</p>
<p>希望、</p>
<p>（一）努力實施以民族主義者爲目標的鄉土敎育並切實了解民族敎育的眞義、</p>
<p>（二）切實恊助本縣鄉上敎材編纂委員會從事鄉土調查及貢獻意見、</p>
<p>（三）切實研究鄉土敎材的内容俾獲正確的敎授、</p>
<p>（四）切實研究實施鄉土地敎材的敎學方法、</p>
<p>（五）努力進修研究一般學理以爲實施鄉土敎育之輔助、</p>
<p>以上數端、固爲不佞對於諸君之希望、實亦爲諸君應有之職員、須知不實行民族敎育、小學敎育、直等於虚耗、不實施鄉土敎育、民族主義的敎育、更無由實現、所以鄉土敎育的成敗、不僅關於小學敎育的興廢、亦且關於整個民族的存亡、所關至鉅、非等具文、諸君所負責任、尤屬重大、尙望勿妄自菲薄、勿意存數衍、一致奮勉、以完成此重大的使命、</p>

<p>婦女園地</p>
<h3 id="c252">女性往何處去？ <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>記得在「五四」以後的六七年中，婦女問題的討論是一件很時髦的事情；但到現在，據說一則因爲鬧了幾年的婦女問題，還是得不到一個較具體的結論，二則因爲現代的社會問題的重心似乎又移到另一個地方去了，於是大家便不得不把個問題暫且擱一擱；而在這一擱的時期，女性還是苦悶着，徬徨着；勇敢一點的，就像蒼蠅碰玻璃窗一様的同舊社會死摒，結果當然是很難說的；而懦弱一點的，就祇能忍着痛苦讓舊社會的波浪呑没了。</p>
<p>大戰的前夜，主義個人的風浪掃蕩了世界的女性，那時候她們所要求的是「自由」，可是她們並没有想到自由要一種經濟的要素來作基礎；因之這個口號用不到等現實來敎訓，早就知道是空呌的了，而幾年來鬧不淸的自由結婚，自由離婚問題，與其他的性關係的喜劇，左右也不過做了世界不景氣的前夜的挿曲而已。</p>
<p>女性要得到眞正的和男子同等的社會地位，祇有和男子一般地去取得作爲一切基礎的經濟地位。「職業女性」這個名詞在現代也許是時髦的吧？不過，誠意地要獲得經濟地位的職業女性，在目前的社會制度下面，處處的還感到碰壁的痛苦。職業與家務的衝突顯然地已成了一切前進的女性的迷宮了；按目前的事實看，要做一個職業的女性，就得放棄組織家庭的權利；否則祇有終生做個　明的主婦。</p>
<p>可是，前進的女性是絶對不願讓家務來决定她們一生的；於是：要得到經濟的獨立；要有個職業，便不得不放棄有一個家庭的權利，不得不孤獨地過一個苦楚的生活，甚至於發生了一種精神上的變態：一切的家庭都被她們用惡意來看待了。</p>
<p>現代的女性就在這衝突的火花中被燃燒着。</p>
<p>其實，這種衝突的存在，並非是客觀的，也不是没有方法免除的。</p>
<p>關於這問題，英國性心理學家藹理斯（Ｈ．Ｅflis）在一篇題目是「家庭的未來」的文字中說得很明白，有一節是値得引過來看一看的：</p>
<p>「：：：女性應適當地把時間與精力分配到家庭和社會二方面去，使這二方面都能有一種以前所得不到的發展。在蘇聯，女性的社會平權已完全依照了ＸＸ的初志而實現了｜｜ＸＸ說過：「毎個管家婦都該知道一點政治。」蘇聯的女性儘多一方面有了很高的社會地位，而一方面又做着主婦的；國家規定在生産前後給她們（指一切的女性｜｜筆者註）二個月的休假，又有托兒所和敎育園來分勞她們的母職，在嬰兒哺乳期她們底薪水還是照給。由此可知在其他國内毋職和社會事業的不能兼顧，並不是必然的不可能的事，祇是那些頑固的習慣和盲目的徧見在作崇而已。」</p>
<p>這兒，藹理斯明顯地指出，而且引用了鐵的事實來證明：女性的職業與家庭並不是客觀地衝突的，所造成這衝突的要業，便是「頑固的習慣和盲目的徧見。」</p>
<p>可是這「頑固的習慣與盲目的徧見」是不容輕視的，這就代表了整個的封建的，不合理的社會制度。</p>
<p>爲自已，爲人類（女性是人類的母親，這一點不會被否認的吧？），今後女性的唯一去處，就是會同了一切不滿於現社會制的，一切被現社會制度，壓榨着的人們去努力取得一種更合理的社會制度。二，一，三三。</p>
<h3 id="c253">婦女的職業技能 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 規中</p>
<p>自然，誰也不能否認，如果整個社會是紊亂的現象，則婦女問題，决不會單獨地得到適當的解决。不過也不能因爲社會現象的惡劣，而因噎廢食地不談婦女解放。我們一方面自然要使婦女運動與社會問題，發生聯繫。而另一方面却應當隨時隨地設法解决一些單獨的婦女問題。這兩件事是互相輔助的。</p>
<p>然則目前我們中國的婦女運動，最値得我們注意的，是一個什麽問題呢？所謂「婦女參政權」、「遺産承繼權」，這種很上層的要求，使大多數的婦女，還是祇好望洋興歎。</p>
<p>我以爲：我們如果需要進一步的解放大多數的婦女，則「婦女職業」是當前的重要問題：</p>
<p>婦女因爲没有相當的職業技能而依賴於人，或者出賣自已的肉體的現象，目前是一天天地厲害了｜長此以往，婦女的社會地位，不會更加沈落到黑暗的深淵裏去嗎？毎一個關心婦女問題的人們，應該拿多大的注意，來補救這個傷心慘目的現象呵！</p>
<p>雖然「失業」恐慌是目前普遍的社會現象，然而對於婦女是更加來得嚴重些。這就因爲是婦女自已缺乏職業技能。譬如很多在機關上作事的女職員，因爲她的能力不够，所以被稱爲「花瓶」。而所謂「花瓶」者，又因爲怕自已不稱職而向上司賣色賣笑，這也是極普遍的事情。　　我們爲着要補救對婦女來得更加嚴重些的這個失業恐慌，那就祇有從充實婦女職業技能這方入手了！</p>
<p>我想今後毎一個受敎育的女子，應該自已計劃着家庭經濟的力量，能使自已受到怎様的敎育、卽在這個範圍内，凖備自已的一技之長，祇要能勝任一件職業，並不見得一定要進大學，我們看見很多没有技能的大學生，終於墮落下來了。</p>
<p>至若工農婦女的職業技能，則需要熱心婦運者、多辦工農讀書班或學校，以提高她們的文化水凖，同時敎給她們各種工藝，寫賬等等技術，則亦可補救於萬一了！</p>
<h3 id="c254">印度婦女界的進步 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 文印</p>
<p>印度是一個宗敎熱的國家，向來各宗敎對於婦女，無論在家族上，在社會上，大都給以頗尊崇的地位。據他們的傳說，謂印度宗敎上某一部經典的原文、是由婦人傳寫下來的。在今日，印度人們仍繼續將薩拉斯梵塞當做學術的女神加以崇拜。但印度婦女之自已覺醒，開始對自已之社會的地位感到興味，則係最近二十年間的事。</p>
<p>在本世紀之初，印度卽出了許多有名的貴婦人。她們開始作有組織的集圑的運動，約在距今十五年之前。最早的婦女圑體爲印度婦女會，成立於一九一七年，係Ｄr.AnnieBesant安尼俾塞泰博士所倡導。現在該會已共有七十二個分會，印度全境各處都有它的會員。這一有組織的婦女運動的結束，使印度聯邦内的婦女都獲得市民權和參政權。</p>
<p>成立於一九二六年的全印席婦女會議，爲最近印度婦女界的一個最有力量的圑體，在各州内共有選舉區一百八十餘處、會議上包括有各階級各種族各宗敎的代表。各處的家政學研究會，婦女專門學校及女敎員養成所等等，都係這圑體所舉辦的附屬事業。此外尙有婦女國民會議、其總部設在Bombays（巴毘耶）另有大學婦女聯盟，係由各大學畢業的婦女學生會所組織，對於社會生活及國際情形的理解有很深的趣味。在各地，更有許多地方的婦女恊會。上舉諸婦女圑體，對於敎育，保健的救濟等等社會事業都有相當的努力，頗有成績。有些圑體兼致力於消除各地言語上的隔離，提倡或獎勵其國家特有的藝術及各種工藝。</p>
<p>現在，印度泰拉梵康爾州的州議會内已有一位女議員，並兼任該州的衛生局長。麥唐拉的立法會議，亦曾由一位女議員擔任代理主席。她們對於普及婦女敎育，婦女與兒童之醫學的救助機關的設立與推廣，婦女種種惡習的革除，少年結婚的禁止等等諸項，都極力主張，期其實施。一般有智識的婦女之任事於各州市的行政機關及敎育機關的、亦復不少。</p>
<p>許多有學識有才能的婦女們都勇敢地參加於風靡印度的國民運動，爲解放其祖國，解放印度民族而鬥爭。如SalojiniNaidu（薩郎伽奈士夫人）之二次入獄，印度婦女會的前書記Mrs.Consins（康士斯夫人）亦爲反對緊急懲治條令而入獄，現仍未被開釋，同會的第一任書記KamalaDevi（康理拉迪梵女士）亦曾因參加政治活動而先後入獄二次。蓋十餘年來，印度的婦人已從自覺而進行自已解决，現在又更進一步，爲解把祖國，解放印度民族而起來與帝國主義作政治的鬥爭了。這進步確是一個好放様，是値得我們借鏡取法的。</p>

<p>二　初潮</p>
<p>女子月經的初潮，普通在十三歲到十八歲之間；因氣候及人種的關係，有遲早的不同。</p>
<p>初潮開始時的症狀，因體質的關係，各有不同，有在不知不覺間突如來潮的，亦有經過幾個月的感覺下腹與腰部的沉重，乳房特别敏感而才來潮的。</p>
<p>不經心的母親，没有注意到她女兒的生理上的變化，讓她驚異，悲哀，對於性知識，不知不覺的發生了暗淡的印象。</p>
<p>少女初次月經來潮的時候，做母親不應該使她做過度的勞働。在這一天當她的新生命的誔生節日，並可替她舉行一種慶祝儀式，以示愉快的紀念。</p>
<p>對於敎授處理月經，在做母親的應該詳爲說明，若實際没有正確的方法時，可給她讀處理月經方法的書籍，這亦是一種很好的辦法。</p>
<p>處理月經的正當手續：第一多用藥棉，那末月經旣不致浸透或汚及衣服，又不致使神經疲憊。使用藥棉的方法，先剪成適當大小，疊成幾層，一經月經染漬，卽行換去或補充新藥棉，毎次交換時間以二小時最爲理想。這時務須注重淸潔，旣不可使用不潔的草紙，亦不可長時間的不換。</p>
<p>月經帶的種類亦有種種様式，在應用方面各有利弊，如橡皮製的雖不致浸透，但不十分經洗，綿織的時有漏出之虞，但後者較前者經濟。</p>
<p>月經時需避免過激的運動，及過勞的操作。</p>
<p>在月經中不宜洗澡、特别不同用汚水洗，免得細菌浸入膣道，而發生意外的危險。</p>
<p>月經來時，尤其是初潮的女子，對一事一物非常容易感動，精神亦特别容易興奮，喜怒哀樂的表現亦特别顯著，所以那時做母親的務必注意使她精神鎭靜。</p>

<p>記者先生</p>
<p>「婦女園地」給我們婦女闢了一塊自由發表意見的地方，這是極有意義的、因爲現在雖說是所謂民國，婦女們雖然在政治上，社會上也有極少數出聲現色的脚色、然而在數量上和質量上都站在極不重要的地位，絶不能說是婦女問題已得到了什麽解决，那末，要解决我們中國現在的婦女問題，究應取什麽途徑呢，我想第一是敎育問題、第二是經濟問題，第三是政治問題。因爲敎育問題若是得到圓滿解决，便有了生活的技能，有了生活的技能，經濟問題自然就可以解决；經濟問題旣解决，便可獨立生活，然後來參加政治運動，自然有恃無恐，循此途徑進行，庶幾不致失之好高鶩遠，或失之空談，先生以爲如何？幸有以敎之，非一人之幸也。朱茹紅</p>
<p>二月二十一日</p>
<p>來書誦悉。你能於舉世醉夢之際，提出解决婦女問題的途徑，可謂要言不凡。婦女問題，雖屬千頭萬緒，然而犖犖大者要亦不外先生所舉三端。惟是先生所舉三者之先後緩急之序，實有商景餘地。就常識的理解說，自然先須解决敎育問題，二三十年來全國士大夫已說得很多，然而要知道敎育的根本在經濟，而其所恃以進行與維持於不敝，或發皇而光大之者則在政治與經濟。故政治問題與經濟問題不根本地與一般地得到解决，而謂能圓滿解决婦女敎育問題，自非痴人，其誰信之？」那末，你以「敎育問題」爲解决婦女問題的第一步便不是探本之論了，至於經濟政治兩端，就基本言之，則經濟爲先，然而欲根本解决經濟問題、若不對於政治做廓淸之舉，絶對不可能。此徵之近事而益信者也。所以我們現在以政治改造爲解决經濟問題之利器，以經濟改造爲完成政治之改造的目的。蓋婦女問題不能離開整個的社會問題，一般的社會問題不解决，婦女問題不會解决，亦猶之乎婦女問題不解决，一般社會亦不能謂之解决一様。一般說來，不得不如此。倉卒做答，未盡萬一，你的意見如何？讀者大衆之意又如何？（記者）</p>
<h3 id="c258">愛倫凱與柯崙泰　（續） <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 紫</p>
<p>斐佩　愛倫凱的戀愛觀是怎様的？</p>
<p>紫文　她主張以靈肉一致，與全人格的戀愛爲基礎，換句話說：在肉體上，知識上，道德上站在同一平行綫上的男女兩人，相互愛合。兩者一體，這様的結合，當可永遠在愛的鎔爐中生活。</p>
<p>瑛瑛　我看這完全是理想，難怪她只好獨身一生了。</p>
<p>紫文　愛倫凱主張結婚不必形式，她說兩性間，旣有了純摯的愛情，自然都有高尙的道德，用不着借法律來保障。同時她又主張無條件離婚，她說戀愛不是永久不變的，兩性間等到絶對没有愛情的時候，當然大家分手，免得貎合神離，彼此痛苦。</p>
<p>瑛瑛　這只可當作一種理想，而且我們希望這理想的能實現。但事實却不使我們這様樂觀，尤其在中國現在這種社會裏，｜｜男性中心的社會裏，結婚雖不必有怎様隆重的儀式，最好需經過法律手續。免得一般不負責任的人們，朝秦暮楚，以戀愛爲游戲。</p>
<p>斐佩愛倫凱的母性興說又如何？</p>
<p>紫文她主張男女分職，各盡份内的責任，女子領域的核心是做母親，所以假使女子不能盡做母親的職務，卽使能盡職於社會，也不能說是「完人」。</p>
<p>紫文　其次我們得談談柯崙泰了。</p>
<p>斐佩柯崙泰現在還是健在着嗎？</p>
<p>紫文是的，今年她已經六十二歲了，但據見到她的人說，假使不知道她年齡的人，還以爲她是個少年夫人呢，她父親「特莫諾米」將軍，是舊俄時代的大地主。非常頑固，所以柯崙泰夫人小時的生活、非常拘束，俄國當時自由主義的思想盛極一時，她父親怕她傳染這思想，所以連學校也不許她進，只許她在家裏勤讀。可是人，常是很奇怪的，在這様的規固的敎養下，她的反抗，反會比常人顯著，她在十八歲那年，就參加各種社會活動。</p>
<p>瑛瑛據說她懂得好幾國語言文字。是嗎？</p>
<p>紫文　是的，她的足跡，走徧了歐美兩洲，起初畢業於德國齊利大學，研究組織學，後來又研究人類學，社會學，對於勞働問題，婦人問題等，有她獨特的見地，同時對於文學，也有十二分的素養。一九一七年俄國革命，她也是其中的一位要角，因之被捕下獄。革命成功，她被推爲布爾雪維克的中央委員。一九二三年被任命爲挪威大使兼通商代表開世界外交史上有女交家之新紀綠。</p>
<p>斐佩她對於婦女解放的見地怎様？</p>
<p>紫文她把過去與將來的社會現象，分作三個時代（一），原始人民、男子爲了遊獵、遊牧，遠征，没有一定的住所，女子事事養育子女，爲養育子女而從事耕作，調理食物，裁制衣服、：；：那時一切以女子爲中心，卽所謂「母權時代」。（二）此後生活安定，男子支配生産，操經濟全權，女子變成了男性的屬從。這所謂「父權時代」。女子只是一生子的機器，是男子的玩物，而且可以金錢賣買。（三）</p>
<p>是因資本主義的發逹，手工業者，小商人，農民，都失了原來的園地從事於機械工作，但低廉的工資，不足維持養活妻奴，於是妻女亦不得不自行從事生産，因女子工資較廉，一般樂於雇用、於已被摒棄於生産部門以外的女子，又回復了與男子同等的領域。女子旣已與男子有同等的經濟領域，當然主張有平等的權利。這纔是眞正「男女平等時代」。柯崙泰曾說「現在一般所謂在法律上的妻子，由男子扶養，不事生産，將子女任傭人養育，終日徒事消費與享樂，這種女子，只可當她是賣淫婦。」</p>

<p>新　洋行廿三日報告云、紐約股市慘落數角至六元、多頭源源賣出、將半月來之所漲全數掃除、蓋據可靠消息、政府思調查各包裝公司之限價陰謀、包裝股因頗軟弱、同時亦因礦股萎靡不振、而本週之報告又無如近來之可觀、投機者遂趨抛賣、債劵以多頭了結續疲、市况有盤旋傾向、全日成交二百二十九萬股、（小麥）市况疲滯、形勢混沌、（棉花）减種形勢、爲維持市况之主要原素、耕種計劃已多完備、廠方進貨减二五九、○○○包、現貨淸堅、茲將道瓊斯指數列後、</p>

<p>二月期昨已停拍｜祇做三四兩月　　紗市晨平、午後趨跌、形勢又轉疲弱、因上日申新廠雖大量收貨、據市塲傳聞、永安廠交出金城紗有二千八百件、二十支富貴亦有二千包、此番解入倉庫中新紗約有三四千包之多、於是人心略軟、賣方乘機活動、市盤遂趨下落、不過棉價較高、紗市恐難大跌耳、</p>
<p>人標下落　人標前市開盤市氣尙好、漲三四角、拍至二三盤、聞金城紗有交進二千八百件、人心又虚、市盤轉疲回下、午後聞現紗交易不暢、賣風又起、各月跌一元四角、全日成交統計一萬六千五百包、查賣出吉豐四百包、森康一千二百五十包、大昶七百五十包、仁豐二百五十包、協生二百五十包、買進大昶一千包、大昌成一千二百五十包、仁豐七百包、泰興一千包、福大六百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市始漲後跌、但印棉趨漲、惟美棉漲跌互見、惟賣方仍抱逢漲抛賣主義、市上現棉廠方需要仍滯、不過各路來源未見暢逹、據一部份報告美棉仍有觀漲消息、棉市就大勢論之、有穩定可能性、</p>
<p>鄭標跌三角　鄭標前市開盤、以印棉上升、買户稍多、各月漲一角半、拍至二三盤又轉下落、各月跌五分至二角、午後各月又跌五分至二角、全日成交統計五萬六千六百担、查賣出同孚一千三百担、振大二千九百担、愼記二千二百担、長豐三千四百担、長和三千担、賡豐四千担、永大一千一百担、大孚一千一百担、買進通記三千五百担、泰興二千担、仁豐二千四百担、源興昌二千九百担、裕大四千三百担、源大一千六百担、元德一千八百担、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>紐約二十三日來電報告一週中之棉市云、週初棉市以當局對彭海氏提案之嘉許、未能激起買　、賣由於多頭大量了結、及同業需要未見急切也、惟其後以南方出貨極薄、而轉反動、目前人心極無把握、緣衆院農業委嗣全對彭海氏提案之遷延不决、最後條件如何、難以逆料、不過羅斯福總統對此案已加贊許、衆望其結果通過若干强迫管理方式也、衆信南方有若干一角押欵棉、倘期貨價到一角二分以上時、行將出售、不過其供給則均被吸收耳、同業於價跌時買進、故實際地位較有起色、同時新棉佈置、較尋常爲速、</p>

<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平定之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥小一角二三分至八分左右、坎拿大小八分零、故開價後、本月份曾稍見、軟、遠期亦覺軟弱、旋因各廠抛胃、已轉觀望、市塲浮空、亦有補進、致交易雖尙見暢、市氣略呈穩定、迨至下午開盤、本月份市情、始終盤旋、土落無幾、遠期各月份、則一致大落、因傳阿根庭麥、定價又見大鬆、聞祇四元一角、（較前日又廉五分）由申大華豐信大合定一船、因此市塲抛貨、又呈暢旺、阜豐抛售尤暢、故遠期均又一角跌進、結果本月未有出入、三月份較跌半分、四五月跌一分半、六月份跌二分、七月份跌分二厘半、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午各月份市面、呈近穩遠疲之象、以洋來報價、芝加哥坎拿大、祇回小八分至一角二三分左右、故開價後交易仍淸、惟本月份因係最後一日、過此卽須交割、全日成交雖少、不過多頭係廠家、有意收進、大約華豐須收二十餘車、價　擯住、六七月份上午未開、下午因洋麥又有定成、人心已軟、開價卽小、結果本月份較好二分、四月份好二分、六月份小二分、七月份小三分、現來市面、到頭尙佳、市則平平、開出東麥三元四角二分、蚌埠麥三元三角二分、次至三角、計一千包、由福新辦去、</p>

<p>昨日客秈續有途貨抵埤、且在半途未到者爲數尤多、蓋因在陰曆年底、初有閩省泉州福州興化厦門各帮之問訊、人心原在望好、多向産地搜索來申、目下閩化一淡、本街與浙帮又無暢胃、客販心虚求說、市乃立見一再下跌矣、湖南紅糙存到兩足、貨主求售更亟、連日已步下半元左右、昨日再小二角、始由福州去一千包、價五元四角八分至四角半、福州又去沙市糙五百四十包、價五元四角、亦小角許、泉州去湖南機油四百包、價七元三角二分、本街去南京機秈一百五十四包、價六元四角、本街又與甬帮等各辦江西機元一百多包、價七元四角至三角半、統市糙紅小二角、其他各小角外云、</p>

<p>豆餅去路本依　南及内地爲主、華南見各地航路便利、其採辦各貨均直逹産地、故上年本市運銷華南之餅、須减少三分之一、近來本市餅價比較外埠爲廉、致汕頭厦門福州等均有問津、昨統市成交各餅有六七萬片之數、乃二星期左右交貨、原因刻下現餅廠方須解交到期之期餅、如需現餅、則有行家回出之貨、</p>

<p>蘭花子以高貨申底本稀、且爲來源不繼、市勢穩秃、連日因各方銷路敏活、故號盤扳緊、開出數十箱、價自三十二三元至三十元不一、但色黑者仍乏受手、據聞如全黃無沙石之貨、現市可提三十四五元、現在號方已去電産區催裝、</p>

<p>浙屬紹興寗波兩處之平水綠茶、去年運銷美國、爲數不下八萬箱、上月底止、美茶商圑積手中、尙有二三萬箱、以前銷售之蔴珠針眉各茶、商家均有微利、邇因美政府擬議提高銀價、人心轉趨動摇、對於手中存貨、亟謀脫售、珠茶售價、毎百磅暴跌五金元、其餘亦跌三四金元、此種不安情態、華茶頗受重大影響云、</p>

<h3 id="c299">好一個「終身不失的職業」 <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>上月一天的下午，有一位態度沉着的靑年朋友，持一封潘先生的介紹信來看我，潘先生曾任東北大學英文敎授。看了信後，方知這位靑年姓盧，是東北大學的畢業生，在九一八事變前後，曾在哈爾濱一個中學敎過書，後來因不甘於做亡國奴的生活，毅然加入義勇軍從事抗日工作。一面坡一役失敗後，遂來上海想找一點事做，誰知一住數月，所帶的錢是用完了，而工作毫無，飽嘗失業的痛若。記者同他談話後，卽請其將數月來失業的感想寫出來看看，以爲介紹時的一種參考。隔日交卷，題爲「我終身不失的職業」，字裏行間充滿了奮激不屈的勇氣，而純潔坦白的自述，尤爲此文的特色。有一位朋友說，文中頗有畿句激烈的語調，不稍予删减麽？唉！我祇覺是一位因抗日而失業靑年的一種極純潔的自白，可歌可泣，可愛可敬！若竟不爲人諒，以惡意見測，則記者惟有從此擱筆了。以下爲盧君的原文，一字未改的附在後面，以代漫談。　　「經濟的恐慌，暴風雨似的彌漫了全球，接着失業的狂濤，秋潮似的汹湧，無數的人，墜入了那飢餓凍餒的冰淵。今日，就好像世界的末日。</p>
<p>一般人的失業，不是爲了被裁掉，便是爲了被排斥，而我這原有「高俸厚祿」職務的人，却是爲了「自甘放棄」。</p>
<p>這似乎是我「自甘放棄」了，但是，毎一個像我這様情形的人，如果他是有血性的話，他必不承認這一句話，而且會堅决地提也抗議。事實是這様的；本來我在哈爾濱一個中學敎書，月薪二百餘元，這不可謂非豐裕已極了。可是，九一八變後，東北敎育，完全奴隸化了，我雖然仍舊的可以領受到同様的「高俸厚祿」，但是，我却不甘做仇寇的俘虜，於是「自甘放棄」了固有的職業，投到了反抗仇寇的隊伍裏去。雖然餐風飲雪，生活的因難爲前所夢想不及的，但我並不以爲苦，反而以安。可是一面坡之役，彈盡援绝，支持數日，終於不得不飲涙而退。從此，好好的故鄉，不是我安身之地了，我又不得不幾經風險而逃到據說是民族運動最激昻的上海來了。到了上海，從報紙上，還可以看到我們政府「長期抵抗」的口號，以及「攘外必先安内」的高論，但是，對於正在抗寇的人如何援助，對於因抗寇而傷亡的人如何救濟、始終没有看到，聽到，而民族運動中心的上海，又被「聲色狗馬」所籠罩了，所迷惑了，同時，我也就「孤立無援」地失業了。這是我自甘放棄「高俸厚祿」的經過，也就是我墜入飢餓凍餒冰淵的成因。</p>
<p>我曾多方地找一個糊口的職業，做我實踐素志的凖備，但是，卽使我自願「大廉價」地拍賣我的血肉之軀，供人的壓榨，剝削，也没有人要。我不相信，我曾經受過高等敎育的人，對於社會一點用處也没有。如果說，高等敎育是無用的話，那末，爲什麽無數的學府依然在造就無數的大學生呢？我情願爲社會而服務，爲什麽社會要「遺棄」我呢？難道。所謂「人才」，也和商品的生産一様的「過剩」嗎？那末，爲什麽蘇俄的生産率超過了現在資本主義國家的數倍，而竟没有一個失業的人呢？這些都是我失業以來後，覓業失敗，鬱積起來的感想。　　現在我雖失掉了一個「高俸厚祿」找不到一個甚至糊口就行的職業，我並不曾自甘放棄，反之，我却抓了一個終身不失的職業，那就是爲眞理務服，爲正義獻身，爲民族解放努力，爲人類的前程戰鬥。事實告訴我們，惟有打倒現在這種不合理的社會，才有生路，才有光明。而且這種不合理的社會，必然地會由於「資本制度蓄積的傾向」而崩潰的，今日也就是資本主義世界的末日了，現在就差我們把它趕入墳墓中去。這就是我的職業，我終身不失的職業。」</p>

<h3 id="c300">做滿月 <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 悲庵</p>
<p>毎夜，吃飽了滿肚的閒氣，拖着疲勞的身體，踏着齪齷的街道，攢進自已的窠裏，妻總是以笑容相迎，百般的安慰我。所以，白天的一切，頓然都消失了。妻，在寂寞悲慘的人生道上，眞是我唯一的安慰者。我很感激她。但是，近幾天來，她的態度，有點異様了。雙眉緊鎖，似乎有重大的心事。和她攀談，她總是陰陽怪氣的。我終於不能耐了，問她道：</p>
<p>「蕙！你怎麽態度改變了？難道有重大的心事嗎？」她跳了起來，用手指在我的額角上，恨恨的道：</p>
<p>「年紀活到這様大，仍舊像個小囝，一點不轉轉念頭。你妹妹要出嫁了，你難道不知道嗎？禮物雖然送過了。但是，照鄉下規矩，還要做一個滿月。」　　「什麽呌做滿月？」我故意問。</p>
<p>「笨蟲！這點都不懂。出嫁以後，滿了一個月，送東西去，呌做做滿月。」她愁悶地答着。</p>
<p>「送點什麽東西呢？」</p>
<p>「二隻鮮腿，六百個圓　，四個包扎，四十個蛋。」</p>
<p>「這點東西，通通買攏來，要多少錢呢？」</p>
<p>「起碼十隻洋」</p>
<p>「十隻洋，」我不禁呆住了。我的薪俸，毎月祇有十四塊大洋，衣食住，平日尙且擔憂不敷分配，那裏再有閒錢去幹這種空頭事呢？死要面孔活受罪的事情，我是不願意幹的。於是對她說：</p>
<p>「妹妹是從小給人家的，現在出嫁，我們只消憑自已的力量，送點禮物去好了。其他的俗禮，可以省了。」</p>
<p>「你這個人有點猪　脾氣，一本正經的事情對你講，你總是這様。你難道不要塲面嗎？你難道不怕人家批評嗎？我倒有點不好意思，人家總以爲是我的主張。」她動氣似的說。</p>
<p>「我没有這種閒錢，我不管，你有錢你去幹好了。」我也動氣似的說。</p>
<p>往常和樂的一間小屋子，頃刻之間，便充滿着愁慮的氣象了。窗外黑黝黝的，北風怒吼着。好像在獰笑我們的窮困。</p>
<p>「我曉得你要這様，所以我不對你講。你不用管好了。你把這個月的伙食費給我。我到娘家去住一個月。把這個月的伙食費，去買做滿月的東西。」靜</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>默了好久，她這様對我講。</p>
<p>她的主張，我本來有點不願意，但是，不好意思再反對她了，以免夫婦之間發生裂痕，所以只好勉强答應了。現在，妻已經回家六天了。毎夜，我回到家裏，屋子裏靜悄悄地鬼都捉得出。凄凉，寂寞，困住我的心頭。</p>

<p>— 柱譯</p>
<p>有一次，墨索里尼到一家戲院裏去看電影。當他蒞院時，電影已經開始映演，所以他得在黑暗中不被人覺察的進入塲内，坐在後面幾排的座位中。在所映的影片中，有一張是描述法西斯蒂在羅馬所發生的一件莊嚴的事件。這事件，墨索里尼也曾親自參加過。當影片裏的墨索里尼在銀幕上出現時。一般觀衆都遵守意大利的習慣，肅然起立，惟有那個眞正的墨索里尼却仍安坐着不動。於是塲内便有人開始不守習慣的彼此互相切切地私語着。一個國防軍兵士正欲近前干涉那不起立的破壞治安的人，這時那大胆的影戲院主人，深恐事情擴大，爲免除衝突起見，便跑到那個安坐不動的紳士身旁，有憤激的語調大聲地呌他立卽起立，　全院的人都可以　見。但接着他又向墨索里尼俯身耳語道：「你知道的，在這裏，毎個人都和你一様的不想起立，但你還是起立的好。」</p>

<h3 id="c302">孫悟空到過的「同温層」 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 光斗</p>
<p>好久以前，我們就聽說蘇聯有三個航空家，由昇同溫層，造成了世界的新紀錄。到了一月三十一日，忽然路透社傳出消息，謂上昇同溫層之人員已慘遭不幸。該電復去：「蘇聯當局正式宣佈上昇同溫層的氣球球室，昨日（一月三十日）下午五時已於距莫斯科二百基羅米逹的一個名呌保迪村裏發現，三航空家皆斃於内，其一面目模糊，難以認淸；聞當氣球下降時突遇暴風襲擊，球囊隧與球室脫離而飄去，球室則驟然下墮，當着地時，聞有兩次宏大爆炸之聲，室内所裝置之儀器均被炸燬。」又據可蒂戈美爾附近一無綫電臺收到同溫層氣球内之最後電訊：「同溫層氣球電，氣球已入雪暴界，球面皆冰，我等已處絶境，兩同僚已命在旦夕云。」可知這次遇險失事大概是在雪暴界。自然，這是航空界的一種損失。</p>
<p>但是，什麽是同溫層？上昇同溫層是一件容易事麽？在高空上看到我們的地球呈一種什麽様的奇觀呢？在那上面人能生活麽？他們到那様高的天空幹什麽？這些問題，都是我的小妹妹在看完了上面的新聞後對我提出的問題，現在避免天文學上的術語，我們就來「讀天」吧！</p>
<p>話說離地面十六羅米突的高空就是所謂同溫層的境界，這境界内除了中國「小說」上有過一位孫悟空先生，曾經一個筋斗，確實就翻到那裏以外，從來世上就少有人到過。一九三二年八月十八日有過一位皮克德先生乘一個大氣球曾經觀不過同溫層一次，可是帶回的記錄也還是很有限的。但這次蘇聯奧薩伐吉姆號同溫層氣球所作之探險，專就光學方面的成功說，已造成精確觀察，對於航行上將發生巨大作用。據蘇聯中央氣象局對於該氣球觀測之結果，獲得天空色素層之變化如下：八·五公哩處爲海藍色，下一公哩處爲深藍色，十三公哩處爲深紫色，十九公哩處爲深紫海藍色，二十一公哩處爲黑紫灰色，二十二公哩處爲黑灰色。其他報告還未公佈，暫時就此「帶住」。</p>
<p>閒話休提，再歸正傳。</p>
<p>却說同溫層就是以上說的一種高空。天空的顔色是按其高度層層不同。大概光的顔色比地面上看的要暗十倍。太陽光綫却比地上强。空氣稀薄到地面上有的十分之一的光景。如果魔術般的把你送到這様高的地方，你全身的备液便要像找開汽水瓶的蓋子似的，會有一種氣體蒸發出來。這理由　簡單：汽水瓶的内部原來密闭着高壓氣體，打開瓶塞，絲絲的發呌時，是壓力突然减低的緣故，人體也是一様。出了氣的汽水會成了普通的水，淡在無味，人體中的血液受到這種的蒸發，内臟各機關就要停止工作。</p>
<p>但是那上面確很美麗，好像一幅略帶黑色的一色畫。用擴大望遠境下望時，通過一層厚的霧氣，地面上的山，河，森林，巨大的建築都不過變成了可笑的小兒玩具似的模型般的東西。在天氣好的時候，可以看地球的圖形，但還不能够看見星宿。</p>
<p>聽了。以上的話就會知道「上天」不一件容易的事。現在世上「上天」的工有：飛行機，氣球，火箭三種。火箭實用還很遠。飛行機也不能昇到十六羅米突（約十哩）的高度。所以最適宜的工具就是氣球，牠没有動力機的震動，無磁氣影響，並且能昇得向。</p>
<p>諸位看過輕氣球麽？至少小孩玩的氣球是玩過的。不過這裏利用的是一種潛水艇中用過的瀝氣的裝置，造成一個小小實騐室似的吊籃。吊籃連於氣球體，或用球網，或用扣帶的吊繩連起。吊籃内的空氣要與陸地上一様，這様上昇的人才能生活。因爲不斷的要有新鮮空氣，所以才用瀝氣，它毎分鐘可以發出半加侖純粹　氣，能把二十加侖的空氣送到鉀上，使鉀吸收呼吸中所生的炭氣。吊籃是密密閉着的，裏面的世界完全與外界隔絶，但裏面坐着的人物並不是魯濱孫·他時刻不斷地利用無綫電去與外界的人通遞消息。</p>
<p>祇要把氫氣注進氣球，這魔球的頭部就昻揚起來，向上空挺躍。在華氏零下五十度到七十六度光景是没有雲雨風電的好世界。但蘇聯航空家這次遇險是在雪雹界，大約總在零下一百多度。</p>
<p>「上天」雖然這様的難，但這難是漸漸被科學所克服了。</p>
<p>至於「他們到那様高的天究幹什麽？」自然，他們不是像我們「重九的登高」似的玩，也不是純然的昌險，好奇，而是研究宇宙綫，因爲這還是人類不大明白的問題。研究宇宙綫又是幹什麽呢？概括一句是：征服天空。如果同溫層的航空路一旦開通了，世界會要起巨大的變化啊！那時歐洲和美洲會縮小成爲兩家隣舍。祇要花費六小時至八小時的時間，紐約的愛人可以出訪一次巴黎的姑娘。地球表面上儘管像倫敦的陰雨，而我們却飛翔於晴朗靑紫的高空，無下界的苦惱，這是以前我們只能在神話中獲得的，現在一天天逹到必然的實現了。</p>
<p>自然，在目下征服天空，還帶有統制天空，取得天空覇權的意義，在軍事上也很是不可忽視的一件事。</p>

<h3 id="c303">中國絲的危機及其影響 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 吉靈</p>
<p>絲業，是我們主要的民族工業之一。其毎年的輸出總額，要佔全輸出的百分之二十以上，價値一萬幾千萬兩。如果不受到别的打擊和摧殘，能順利發展，則其前途實是未可限量的。但不幸自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌發生以來，因爲日法意等國的競爭，人造絲的抵制，與夫我們自已的主觀的摧殘（如苛捐雜税，如水災兵禍），使得我國的絲業日益衰落，甚至陷於完全破産的地位。這情形，在民國十七年以來的華絲輸出額的數目字这日益减少的事實中表現得非常明顯｜｜</p>
<p>年次　華絲輸出額（單位担）</p>
<p>民國十七年　一八○·一八六</p>
<p>十八年一八九·九八○</p>
<p>十九年一五一·四二九</p>
<p>二十年一三一·一八六</p>
<p>廿一年七八·二一九</p>
<p>同時，華絲的市價也日益减少，自民十七以來，其市價之低落表現出了如次的形勢｜｜</p>
<p>民國十七年　十八年　十九年　二十年　廿一年</p>
<p>十二月　十二月　十二月　十二月　十二月</p>
<p>高等白絲經（單位担）一·八四七　一·七二六一·五一八一·四五一一·○三六</p>
<p>（單位國幣一元）</p>
<p>及至去年，我國生絲之輸出更行大减，其市價更跌至了毎担五百元左右的狀態。</p>
<p>於是，絲廠停工，整個絲業都陷於破産的狀態中。</p>
<p>我國的絲業本是以江浙爲中心。江浙繅絲廠原有一百八十餘家，絲車四萬？八千餘部。但在去年度，上海絲廠開工者不到二十家，無錫絲廠開工者僅六家。及到最近，更是幾乎全體歇業｜</p>
<p>此外，如廣東，四川，山東等地的絲業，更是因爲受到了種種「天災人禍」的打擊，陷入了萬刦不振的地步。</p>
<p>絲業的衰落乃至破産，其結果首先是失業工人數量的增加，招來整個社會的危機，單以江浙來說，最近就多了因絲廠停工而失業的六十萬以上的人。</p>
<p>其次受到絲業衰落的影響的，是織綢業。因爲日絲和其絲織品的傾銷，華綢的銷路幾乎完全失去，就是南洋羣島一帶的市塲最近也已被奪去了。於是織綢廠也不得不紛紛停工，在上海，最近尙能勉强開工者，僅有五家！</p>
<p>還有，種桑養蠶，是我國農民的主要副業。近年來，因爲絲業的凋敝，鄉村農民因養蠶失敗而發生慘劇者正不知有多少。四川雲貴等省的農民因養蠶無利，竟自紛紛將桑地改種鴉片；就是江蘇，桑地也逐漸减少，據調查，江蘇在民國十九年尙有桑地二十五萬一千畝，及至二十一年，已减至八萬四千畝了。這様一來，不僅使農村經濟更加破産，同時這一破産還可反轉來影響我們的絲業和一切工商業。</p>
<p>由此可知，中國絲業之衰落破産的危機，不僅關係於絲及一切民族工業的前途，而且有關於我們的整個國民經濟和我們的整個社會的命運。</p>
<p>故事</p>
<h3 id="c304">燒烤師與搬運夫 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 子明譯</p>
<p>在巴黎，在一家燒烤師的舖子門前，一個搬運夫一面嗅着肉類燒烤品所蒸發出的氣，一面吃着自已的麵包，這様，他覺得麵包發出香味，而且滋味也很好。</p>
<p>對於這様的舉動，燒烤師並不加以阻止。但是，當那整個的麵包被呑嚥下肚的時候，他就一把抓住搬運夫的衣領，向他索香味的代價。</p>
<p>搬運夫回答說，他對於燒烤師所燒烤的肉製品，絲毫無所損傷，也没有拿過他的什麽東西，他對於他並不負欠什麽。香味化了氣向外曳，顯然地牠是消失了；從來没有人聽見過，說在巴黎曾有人呌過路客付過燒烤品的氣的價。</p>
<p>燒烤師反對搬運夫的話，他說，他也一様地從不曾聽見過，說他應該用他燒烤品的氣來餔養這班人。他聲言，如果搬運夫不立卽償付他，他便要把搬運夫的棒，扁擔等特没收了。聽到這一番話，於是搬運夫就攫取了自已的棒，而置身於自衛狀態中。</p>
<p>兩方爭辯甚烈。巴黎好事者四集，而敏慧聞於全市區的約翰瘋子，也正好在那裏。</p>
<p>燒烤師一眼望見了約翰瘋子，便問搬運夫道：</p>
<p>「你願意讓約翰來解决我們的爭執，做我們的裁判官嗎？」</p>
<p>「好，我願意，」搬運夫說。</p>
<p>兩造把他們爭執事件的經過，原原本本的告訴了年老的約翰；約翰聽了，便呌搬運夫從搭連裏拿出一枚某種小銀幣來。</p>
<p>搬運夫乃把一枚値五法郎的小銀幣放入約翰手中。</p>
<p>那瘋子接了銀幣，帶着一種認眞的神色，把牠放在他左肩上，似乎在查騐牠的重量；接着，又把牠移近他右眼的瞳子旁，似乎在察看牠所造花紋是否無僞；後來，又把牠在櫃臺上輕投着，使之發聲，這様有很多次，似乎在檢騐牠是否是由良好銀質製成的。</p>
<p>當瘋子做着那種種舉動的時候，旁觀的一班，事者都肅靜舞嘩，燒烤師正預備着想把這小銀幣放入袋裏，而搬運夫則面現悲哀之色。</p>
<p>最後，年老的約翰，帶着法庭庭長的威嚴，將小銀幣揑在手裏，把頭上的帽子擋緊，又咳嗽了兩三聲，高聲地發言了：</p>
<p>「本法庭現在下着這様的判决：那個搬運夫，他雖曾在燒烤品的香氣縈繞中吃着麵包，但現在，他已經用他銀幣的響聲償付給燒烤師了。此外，本法庭命令各人回自已的家裏去，並免出庭費。」</p>
<p>巴黎瘋子的判詞，似乎是那様的公正，那様的受一般有知識者的欽佩，甚至使他們不相信任何巴黎或羅馬法庭會有過比這更好的判决。</p>
<p>由此可知：一點點的聰明和敏慧，其價値常等於豐富的學問或知識。</p>

<p>— 慄</p>
<p>在一册畫報上，無端的瞥見了故鄉的象鼻山。我不知道這是攝影者的藝術的眼光，還是故意要藉此嘲弄我，這影幅偏偏剪取了一樓一塔，一叢可入畫的楓林？這景緻我是太熟了，是我數年前朝夕頂禮的聖地。這様的主人就是淸水先生。臨江的一角紅樓，就是淸水先生心愛的女公子斐英讀書作畫之所，而七年前的斐英正是與我朝夕不離一步的人。闊别天涯，於今已是七載，淸水先生傳聞早已物故了，而斐英呢？據說也已成了三個孩子的母親。本來，時光的冲洗，使我對於那一段因緣，一天天的淡薄，直到今年，甚至連一點依稀的倩影亦復不在心頭。不想這作惡劇的畫圖，又偏偏於今日今朝送到我的眼裏，不禁又使我重溫了一番舊夢，燃起了我七載壓抑未死的痴情。</p>
<p>也是這様風雪連朝的昏夜，我從北國師來。剛踏上故鄉的土壤，我以因緣得於一個演講會中遇到了斐英。當時雖經朋友特爲介紹，說她是省立高中的高材生，並能畫一手淸勁的墨竹，不過，這平淡的社交的一晤，那能使健忘的記憶，攝住她的麗影呢？</p>
<p>第二次見面我們是在公園。這尤其是出於天凑。大概是她的一位女友是我的姻戚之故罷。這次我們竟有兩小時的快談。她自然是認識我了，也略知道我的身世。談話的材料大致不離北平學校情形及學科的程度，似乎特别注意她自已的英文，她一連重複問了兩遍，英文要什麽程度方可考入大學。其他的話以後也就不能回憶了。</p>
<p>因爲她的父親與我的伯父是舊日的同年，他探知了我的歸來，不久就前來造訪，一見面就向伯父懇求，呌我抽閒去敎他女兒一二個月英文，我因伯父之命，也就不好堅拒了。</p>
<p>記得我們開講之日，因爲我要先知道她的程度，以便决定敎材，開始就舉行考試。不想，她的程度已超過「大預」水凖，使我吃了一驚。但是她是不相信的，最後仍决定了一本散文作爲讀本，以外指定了幾册現代小說，一種英文週報作爲瀏覧。因爲她已有了自修的能力，所以在敎課進行中，只有文學的談話，却無需章句的講解，這使我感覺不可名言的欣快。</p>
<p>我們漸漸相互的有了一種興趣上的共同，氣質上的融化，我們一天天的往情愛方面推移。</p>
<p>猶記得二人相對，有時竟沉默至半小時，大家想不出一句適當的語言，以遮蓋彼此的心心相印，結果總是雙方弄得面紅耳赤，故意的迥避了事。我們都是謹嚴的人，無論那一方面都不敢稍露一點暗示。愛苗被壓抑了，可是内心的火燄反因這一壓力更燃燒到極頂，我們唯一的發洩只能宣之文字。我記得那年我的日記特别增加空前的篇幅。</p>
<p>好事多磨，第二年春天我卽有千里的遠行，而她的中學生活此時還未終結，事實上又不能離省升學，我們祇有忍心的暫别了。</p>
<p>我是那般法懦的不敢提出對她的愛的接受，致使她對我生出了疑心、以爲我心上另有了佳人，不欲愛情濫用。這點使她傷了心；同時她對我也生出了更熱烈的敬意。她幾乎爲我毁滅了。</p>

<p>志向，自然這也是可貴的。我對此原無一點自私的痛惜，不過，我確是負了她。然而，一回顧自已現在的流浪，生活的艱辛，則又反覺得她幸而没有與我結成伴侶，我不能使她溫飩飽，是千眞的事實。現在她有了三個孩子已足慰她而有餘，聽說生活也還可過，總比嫁我强多了。</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>「九一八」，「一二八」雖然早已過去，但溥儀稱帝，日本北擾察哈爾，新疆獨立，英國西進侵略：國難時期，顯然還未過去。在此國難時期中，凡是中國人，都應臥薪嘗膽，以圖自强。然而，一般摩登男女却不懂得這個道理。他们不是喫西餐，穿洋服，講戀愛，打高爾夫，進跳舞塲，溜冰，看戲，過其浮華的浪漫生活，好像並没有國難這回事一様。於是有志之士，奮然興起，以爲中國之所以弄不好者，其罪不是在這般摩登男女之不能臥薪嘗膽，。假如全中國的人都以臥薪嘗膽，中國不是就富强起來了嗎？於是摩登倒霉，羣起而攻之。　　去年是「國貨年」，今年是「婦女國貨年」，凡是中國人，都應該努力提倡國貨，這是不可爭議的道理。然而，一般摩登男女却别具心肝，他們穿美國皮鞋，戴英國帽子，着法國衣服，用東洋香水，似乎並不知道其是中國人一様。於是有志之士，又生氣了，以爲中國工商業之所以不能發逹者，其罪還是在這般摩登男女之不用國貨，假如他們不像這様，中國的工商業不是早已發逹到歐美那様的程度了嗎？於是摩登倒霉，羣起而駡之。</p>
<p>文人是最敏感，最能把握着時代的。摩登男女旣有那様大的罪過，人人都在攻他駡他，聰明的文人焉有不將牠作爲寫文章唯一題材之理？於是什麽「摩登女郎的愛人要用機關槍掃射」呀！什麽「摩登太太要和一打以上的狗來睡覺」呀！什麽「摩登少爺穿着冰鞋跑過南京路」呀！什麽「摩登學生拿着高爾夫球上講堂」呀！這類的文章便一批一批地出現了，於是無論幽默的文章，諷剌的文章，正經的文章，都是没有不談摩登的。於是摩登倒霉，口誅筆伐，便都集中於牠一身了。</p>
<p>然而，摩登曰：「天下本無事，庸人自擾之！人生行樂耳，那裏管得着這許多！」</p>

<h3 id="c308">逹爾文（二） <a href="#c308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— 几凡</p>
<p>逹爾文的大學時代開始於一八二五年，時年僅十六歲，他同他的哥哥進了愛丁堡大學。他的哥哥專攻醫學，並且快要完成了，他則剛剛開始。在這一段時間中，我們也可發現他的天才來。</p>
<p>他不滿意當時大學的講義的演述。他覺得那些敎授們全只會說些十分乏味的話，使他不能得到一點印象。他曾說：「敎授講述人類解剖學是那般的枯燥無味，竟和他本人一様，這科目都令我討厭了。」他又不愛聽頓康講的大黃的性質，也從此不愛藥石這個名詞了。但是他對博物學完全是另一種心情。當他結識了馬基裏夫黎時竟一見如故，馬氏贈了一些蚌彀給他，他視爲非常的珍貴，同時他亦告知馬氏，自已正在搜集海産軟體動物。從此亦可窺得，敎育對於學生之啓發與興趣，有非常的重要作用，今日敎育制度之不善，更不知戕賊過多少逹爾文類的天才啊！</p>
<p>逹氏居愛丁堡大學僅二年。家人已探得他無意做一個醫生。他的父親，因見逹氏好射獵，深恐他將來流入懶惰不做事之運動家一途去，於是勸他改學做牧師。他對這一提議，雖然也經過一番考慮，後竟一時的接受了；並且承受了英國正敎。在這一轉變間，他又得新去翻閱古典書籍，習希臘文，預備入劍橋去。但他到底不是一個牧師的天才，在他離去劍橋大學加入彼格爾爲博物學家時，回味這一段短短生活，他不得不放出滑稽氣分的微笑來。他祇能做一個科學家。</p>
<p>在劍橋大學基督專門部時代的逹爾文，雖然這時對於數學與古典方面均用過一些工人，但他生性就不近數學，對古典的神學亦不過爲了應學士考試的緣故才去敷衍了事。所以這一段時光，也不能不說是完全虚度了。</p>
<p>射獵的習慣在這時並不因神學的敎條而改變，反之，却因講堂生活的枯燥而逼使天才作户外的遊蕩了。他還學會了騎馬，常常馳驅田野，整日荒嬉。並且結交了各種氣質不同的朋友，有運動專家，有輕浮少年，同時也有高尙志趣的靑年。常以歡飲，鬥牌，彈奏，射獵爲樂。而這一時期，在遊樂以外，仍現出天才的傾向，不過，當時一般常人毎毎被以上不良的印象所蔽不能認識這位天才罷了。</p>
<p>他仍對於搜集慾甚旺，而最使他醉心的是搜集蜣蜋類。</p>
<p>他在自傳中，曾記述過下面的一段趣事：</p>
<p>「有一天，我又去撕剝那些老樹皮，發覺了兩個稀有的甲蟲，我於是毎隻手捉得一個。不想，後來又發現第三新種了。我不肯將它抛棄，便將右手手着（</p>
<p>的那個蟲含到嘴裏去。呀！呀！這東西眞古怪，實射出了一種十分辛辣的流質來，燒了我的舌頭，我不得不將它急吐出來，這一來，它逃跑了，而那第三個蟲也不知跑到那裏去了。</p>
<p>他還愛將冬季的老樹上的苔類刮去，或在船底搜集附在積穢上的寄生動植物，也常獲得新鮮的標本。（未完）</p>

        <h1>1934.02.25</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Improvement of Technical Standards <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Past: From October 13, 1932, to March 1933, overcoming numerous economic difficulties (in its early days, the Yi Hua Film Company consisted of only three small houses and an empty lot, attracting no attention at all). Despite personnel changes, "National Survival" was finally completed with its last scene, followed by "Hand-to-Hand Combat," which concluded in just over three months. Impressed by the relatively good performance of these two films, and noting that the domestic film industry alone showed signs of prosperity amidst widespread economic depression, Yan Chuntang decided to rename the "Yi Hua Film Company" to "Yi Hua Film Industry Limited," actively purchasing large tracts of land to build magnificent studios, reforming the company's structure, recruiting new and old talent from the film and art worlds, establishing a three-year film production plan, and so on. Within three months, the company's atmosphere was completely renewed, and "Flames" and "The Fury of the China Seas" were being produced in relatively comfortable environments. Soon after, the company executives, observing that the existing production techniques were still insufficient to meet the standards already achieved by the Chinese film industry, at a banquet hosted by Yan Chuntang, in the heat of the moment, everyone enthusiastically pledged to contribute their talents to the first film after the company's reorganization. Bu Wancang guest-directed, while Du Yu handled sound recording and cinematography, and Jin Yan and Gao Zhanfei guest-starred, thus becoming the beginning of the "Golden Age" production plan. Later, Bu Wancang left his original company to officially join this company, followed by Zhou Kefang, Pei Lin, and others signing contracts one after another. Du Yu, Ying Yunwei, and even Shi Dongshan and Zheng Yingshi were all brought onto the same battle line, forming the impressive lineup of the company today.</p>
<p>Present: Looking back at the arduous entrepreneurial era of a year ago, now, one can say that the scale is complete. Currently in production or about to begin production are four films: "Golden Age," "Woman," "Flying Flower Village," and "Life." There are also eight to twelve new films in the planning stage. At the very least, we hope to have twelve to sixteen productions each year.</p>
<p>Future: Obstacles and difficulties are not only inevitable in achieving anything, but also a common experience in life. We have absolutely no discouragement and will continue to strive for cooperation with artistic talent and improvement of technical standards to aid the development of the domestic film movement and compete with foreign films. This is also the greatest goal that this company strives for day and night. At the same time, we only believe in answering the earnest expectations of colleagues in the film industry and society with facts, burying ourselves in hard work, and never giving up. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will cherish this newborn bud and nurture it, which would be a fortune not only for this company, but also for the entire nation and the entire country.</p>

<p>Over 1,700 People Intercepted West of Linhe</p>
<p>Sun Orders Ding's Brigade to Attack Ningcheng</p>
<p>And Sends a Unit Straight to Liangzhou</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi received a telegram from Wang Jingguo on the 24th, stating: According to a telegram from the head of the Shi regiment in Linhe, Sun Jun's troops west of Linhe are panicking due to our army's active westward advance and are fleeing westward in disarray. I led my troops in pursuit and made contact with the enemy. However, due to the limited strength of our forces, we were unable to completely annihilate them. In this battle, we intercepted over 1,700 of their personnel, over 1,000 rifles and artillery shells, and over 100 firearms of various sizes. I have ordered all units to advance rapidly. The Jin-Sui army units that have reached Linhe include one division. Those advancing westward beyond Linhe include three regiments, advancing rapidly towards San Shenggong and Dengkou. Contact was made with Sun Jun's forces west of Linhe on the 20th. (24th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou telegram: Sun Jun has been fiercely attacking Ningyuan for days without success. They are currently clearing obstacles for the siege. It is rumored that Sun himself is near Ningyuan. According to aerial reconnaissance, in addition to sending a regiment each of cavalry and artillery to the walls of Ningyuan, Sun has also dispatched a unit directly from Pingluo to Liangzhou and Yongcheng, with the intention of attacking the Qing army's rear and threatening Lanzhou. The Shaanxi troops in southern Gansu have received orders from Yang Hucheng to quell the Liu bandits and have been deployed to northern Shaanxi to reinforce defenses. Three divisions and one regiment of Jin-Sui army infantry, cavalry, and artillery are completely concentrated in Linhe. Wang Jingguo went from Sui to Bao yesterday and then to the front lines in Linhe to make arrangements. Zhao Chengshou is waiting in Sui to meet with Fu before departing. (24th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, Sun Dianying plans to seize Ningyuan in one fell swoop before the Jin-Sui army mobilizes, and then enter the Shaanxi-Gansu border to seek another way out. In that case, even if the Jin-Sui army mobilizes, it will be too late. The Jin-Sui army's funding, as proposed by Fu Zuoyi, is for clothing replacement costs, mobilization station expenses, and transportation costs between Bao and Deng. Apart from the mobilization expenses, which have already been allocated, the remaining funds are still being calculated. Fu met with He Yingqin sometime this year to request instructions, and He has agreed to allocate more funds. Fu will return to Sui to command once the funding issues have been fully resolved.

<p>(Moscow) A message from Tashkent, according to refugees who fled from Kashgar to the Soviet border, states that the situation in southern Xinjiang after early February is as follows: The Donggan army of Ma Zhaihe (transliteration) has been stationed in the Kashgar fortress in Yingjisha since last year. With the reinforcements from Ma Zhongying in Turpan, they attacked and occupied Kashgar, looting and killing many Uzbek and Indian merchants. Many innocent people abandoned their homes and fled to the mountains. However, local Uzbek and Kyrgyz leaders organized the local people into an army and attacked Kashgar. After fierce fighting, they were defeated by the Donggan army. The "independent" government of Sacite Majoric fled south with its troops after the Donggan army occupied Kashgar, gathering in Yarkand (200 li southeast of Kashgar). They are trying to attack Kashgar again to restore their government. Ma Zhongying's occupation of Kashgar indicates that Ma intends to expand his influence in southern Xinjiang after his defeat in northern Xinjiang. (23rd TASS Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e27">The Silver Agreement Issue · Guo <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>According to recent overseas telegrams, the US government is quite interested in raising silver prices and re-minting silver coins. Silver faction congressmen in particular are advocating for this very strongly. Currently, this plan is under consideration by the Senate's Banking and Currency Committee. The banking industry in this port believes that fluctuations in silver prices have a very important relationship with our country. On the 20th of this month, in the name of the Shanghai Banking Association, a telegram was sent to US President Roosevelt, requesting that he give this matter careful consideration. At the same time, another telegram was sent to the Nanjing government, requesting a temporary halt to the approval of the London Silver Agreement. As a result, the long-dormant silver issue has once again taken on a serious appearance.</p>
<p>The fundamental crux of the American silver issue, superficially, is due to the promotion by the silver faction congressmen, but in reality, it is the consistent policy of the United States to raise silver prices and open up the Far East market in order to exclude the power of the English and Japanese nations. The habit of using silver among the people of various Far Eastern regions has been around for a long time, and the development of English and Japanese power is just beginning. In order to promote the sale of American goods, the Roosevelt government believes that the only method is to raise silver prices. If silver prices are high, then American goods can easily flow into China, and consequently, the power of the English and Japanese nations will inevitably suffer a considerable blow. This is what the Roosevelt government is confident in. The establishment of the 1933 London Silver Agreement was merely the beginning of the American silver hoarding policy. After the establishment of the London Silver Agreement, the American gold hoarding policy and silver hoarding policy have almost progressed at the same time. This can be seen from the approval of the London Agreement on December 21, 1933, and the law on recovering all gold in the country in January of this year. In short, the American policy of raising silver prices had already shown an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Among the signatory countries of the London Agreement, the positions of the United States and Mexico are most important in terms of silver-producing countries. The United States must purchase 24 million ounces per year, and Mexico must purchase 7 million ounces per year. In terms of silver-using countries, the positions of India and Spain are the most important. India must not sell more than 35 million ounces of silver per year, and Spain must not sell more than 5 million ounces of silver per year. Of the above four countries, other than Spain, whose approval is unknown, the rest have approved and announced the agreement one after another after November 21 of last year. According to this, the important silver-producing and silver-selling countries must not freely supply silver to the world market. However, in reality, even if China does not approve the agreement, the United States can still have the freedom to hoard a large amount of silver to achieve its goal of raising silver prices. Therefore, judging from the current situation, it is unreasonable to say that we can use the means of not approving the agreement in the position of a contracting country to achieve the effect of preventing American silver hoarding actions.</p>
<p>Although, the American policy of raising silver prices is a natural trend in the economic panic of vying for markets, then the rise in silver prices is of course expected soon, and its impact on our country is very significant, and its relationship to our profit and harm is also very complex. It is not easy to reach a conclusion without gathering a large number of experts for detailed discussion. This issue will be discussed further.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, the Panchen Lama sent Zhu Funan with 3,000 yuan in cash to Shi Qingyang, requesting that rice tickets be purchased and distributed to all the poor people in the capital. He also entrusted 10,000 yuan in cash to Commissioner Xu Shiying of the Disaster Relief Committee and Wang Yiting, as well as Commissioner Shi Qingyang of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Nanjing Mayor Shi Ying, Minister Lin of the Ministry of Personnel, and Secretary-General Xu of the Examination Yuan, to discuss methods for distributing the funds to infant welfare programs in Nanjing, Chang'an, and Luoyang, such as orphanages and infant nurseries. The funds will also be sent by Zhu Funan to be held in trust by Dai Chuanxian. Shi Qingyang will soon invite Wang, Xu, Shi, and Lin to jointly consider methods for distributing rice in the capital and to investigate the current state of infant welfare programs in the three capitals to determine the amount of donations to be allocated. It is said that the general principle is that Nanjing is close to Shanghai and has more benefactors, while Luoyang has a smaller area and population. Only Chang'an has a large area and population and has been a disaster area for many years. Therefore, the future distribution of donations will prioritize Chang'an, followed by the capital, to ensure that the Master's donations can widely establish good karma and also align with the local conditions, so that orphaned and helpless children can all receive tangible benefits.

<p>Ambassador Saito's Activities in the U.S. and the Theory of Dividing the Pacific Hegemony</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota stated the following to Baron Sakamoto Toshiatsu at the Budget Committee of the House of Peers on the 23rd: If the United States understands Japan's position in the Orient, and Japan understands the position of the United States, and diplomatic problems are handled with a full sense of goodwill, then there will be no problems between the two countries. It is most important for Japan and the United States to first have this fundamental concept. Japan has no intention of creating incidents with the United States. If the United States fully understands this point, then both countries will not need to worry about the necessity of an emergency. This is my fundamental concept regarding future relations with the United States. Japan and the United States should not consider issues such as war between the two countries, and must work hard in diplomatic efforts to improve relations with each other. In that case, when discussing issues such as disarmament in the future, there will be no fierce opposing emotions, and the disarmament issue can be resolved in a peaceful atmosphere. Because Japan needs to know about the situation in the United States beforehand, it has dispatched Ambassador Saito, stationed in the Netherlands, directly to the United States to meet with the President and other influential people to talk as much as possible, verify the opinions of the United States, and then call him back to the country at an appropriate time to discuss the policy towards the United States with the military authorities and to understand where the Japanese government and the people hope. Then he will be ordered to take office again and negotiate practical issues. This is the government's planned plan. (24th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At yesterday's Budget Committee of the House of Peers, Baron Sakamoto Toshiatsu stated that former U.S. Undersecretary of State Castle had repeatedly stated in public that the United States recognizes the superiority of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific and does not hesitate to do so. If Japan also recognizes the superiority of the U.S. Navy in the eastern Pacific and establishes a neutral zone between them, it should be effective in avoiding conflict between Japan and the United States. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that dividing the Pacific into two, conducting such negotiations, and guaranteeing the independence of the Philippines are imaginable issues for improving relations between Japan and the United States. If an agreement can be reached on this point, peace between Japan and the United States can be maintained. After receiving Ambassador Saito's report, appropriate measures will be taken. However, the Navy's view on the establishment of this neutral zone is that it is difficult to achieve. Although the idea of setting up a neutral zone in the Pacific is ideal, there are still problems with territorial waters near land, let alone setting up a neutral zone in the Pacific. (24th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before the difficulties of the next disarmament conference, Foreign Minister Hirota decided to adjust the peaceful relationship between Japan and the United States. He deeply felt the need to negotiate with the United States without any separation beforehand. Therefore, he recently telegraphed Ambassador Saito in the United States, instructing him to meet with influential people such as President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, and to exchange views on the opening of Japanese-American relations, naval issues, and Far Eastern issues, and to strive to eliminate the ominous concept of war between the two countries. After the negotiations with all parties come to an end, he will return to the country. The real intention of Foreign Minister Hirota is to explore the true intentions of the United States regarding the Far Eastern issue and the naval ratio, and then establish Japan's countermeasures to give full play to the true value of cooperative diplomacy. Ambassador Saito's return to the country is expected to be around May. After returning to the country, he will negotiate with the military and foreign affairs authorities to establish a new policy, and then return to the United States again around August.

<p>(Berlin) Foreign rumors have been spreading that Germany is about to recognize "Manchukuo." Today, the authorities officially denied this, calling the rumors groundless. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the morning newspapers here published news that the United States is discussing the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo," which greatly surprised diplomatic personnel. It is rumored that the British Foreign Office has telegraphed its ambassador to the United States to investigate the matter. However, the Foreign Office denied this action. The newspaper also said that the reason why the United States wants to recognize "Manchukuo" is because of rumors that Germany intends to expand its commerce in East Asia, so it is now preparing to recognize "Manchukuo." (23rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the news of the United States' change of attitude towards "Manchukuo" reached here from New York, British sources said that the recognition of "Manchukuo" is not an issue for Britain, and that Britain still intends to faithfully abide by the resolution passed by the League of Nations not to recognize "Manchukuo."

<h3 id="e60">A Page of Japanese Aid to Imperial Russia During the European War <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>More Than 50 Million Yuan of Imperial Russian Deposits Confiscated</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the government submitted to the House of Peers the general settlement book for the seventh year of Showa, with the audit report of the Board of Audit attached. Among them, the notification deposit of 58 million Japanese yen from the Imperial Russian government in the Yokohama Specie Bank was confiscated due to the statute of limitations, so the government was blamed for not acknowledging it. The main points of the report are as follows: During the European War, the government accepted Imperial Russian bonds to aid Imperial Russia, and Imperial Russia deposited money in the Yokohama Specie Bank to repay the bonds. However, after the Russian Revolution, the Soviet Russian government declared that it did not recognize foreign debts. However, the Japanese government issued temporary national treasury bonds worth 70.288 million Japanese yen from the seventh to the ninth year of Taisho to repay the private sector for the price of military equipment sold to Imperial Russia. Later, because the Soviet Russian government declared that it did not recognize foreign debts, the deposit was used to compensate for the loss. At that time, there were about 50 million Japanese yen in deposits from the Imperial Russian government in the Yokohama Specie Bank, so the bonds were sold to the Yokohama Specie Bank for 67.489 million Japanese yen. However, in the seventh year of Showa, the deposit was confiscated due to the statute of limitations to avoid the Yokohama Specie Bank's obligation to pay repeatedly. As for the government's replacement of private sector losses, it was precisely because the government's deposit was used to fill the gap. Therefore, a portion of the 300 million Japanese yen in Japanese claims against Russia can be offset. This is a natural way to deal with it, so it should not be attributed to the Yokohama Specie Bank. In addition, the clarification of the Ministry of Finance is as follows: The government's debt to the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Yokohama Specie Bank's claim against Russia are in fact related due to the temporary national treasury bonds, but they are different issues in law. Therefore, it is inappropriate to criticize the Board of Audit. There is likely to be considerable discussion on this issue in the House of Peers. (24th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>Guiding Writers and Publishers</p>
<p>Easing Feelings Toward the U.S., Britain, and Russia</p>
<p>An article in the February 18 Tokyo Asahi Shimbun stated that recently, magazines and books related to war, diplomacy, and military affairs have flooded the streets. The current parliament attaches great importance to this issue and has discussed it in detail with the four ministries of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Interior. As a result of the opening of the policy consultation council, on the 16th, concrete methods for cracking down were decided and announced for implementation, namely (1) prohibiting the publication of documents on strategic and tactical matters relating to foreign wars, and (2) prohibiting all publications that unnecessarily provoke the feelings of other countries or incite war. At the same time, various publications are being guided on matters that do not hinder military affairs and diplomacy. The four ministries concerned are devoting all their efforts to open consultation meetings with publishers and authors every month. On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior, from a crackdown standpoint, is preparing to rigorously rectify the situation. (According to reports, since last year, Japan has published no less than dozens of books on war against the United States, Russia, and Britain. The content completely exaggerates how Japan can defeat Britain, the United States, and Russia, and seize the reins of East Asia. Since the magazine "Hinode" published the "Record of Future War Between Japan and the United States" in its supplementary issue in January, it was confiscated by U.S. customs in Honolulu, causing resentment among the American people. The country's peaceful politicians are deeply angry at the military's young officers deliberately provoking international emotions, and proposed impeachment in the parliament. The new Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro, in view of the increasingly dangerous international situation and the fierce attacks from domestic politicians, had no choice but to change course in order to ease the situation. Among the most popular books, such as "Japan's War Against the World in Showa 10" written by Navy Major Ishimaru and "Inevitability of War Between Britain and Japan," "Pacific Strategic Theory" by Ikeizaki Tadataka, which refers to the war against Britain and the United States, "The Japanese-American War Theory" by Kawashima Seijiro, and "The Imminence of the Japanese-Russian War Again" by Nakayama Shiro, and other national magazines inevitably publish similar texts in each issue. As a result, various countries are deeply angry at Japan's ambition and are anxiously studying how to cope with it. Japan, knowing that crises are lurking, has announced the crackdown on anti-foreign thought.)</p>

<p>A Theory of Fascist Sabotage</p>
<p>Movement of Affiliates of the Seiyukai</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of Minister of Education Hatoyama's discipline has been investigated by the inquiry committee based on the statements of Representative Okamoto. The results reveal many unclear points, and therefore the situation has suddenly turned in favor of the government. However, the Minister of Education has already decided to resign at an appropriate time. Because Hatoyama comes from a political party, his successor is not easy to decide. Prime Minister Saito is considering countermeasures in his sickbed. The House of Peers and other parties observe that the current cabinet will resign en masse after the budget is passed. However, Saito has no intention of abandoning the cabinet. Moreover, influential figures in political circles believe that there are fascist forces behind the behavior of exposing the Minister of Education's disciplinary issues this time. Therefore, the political parties do not want to deliberately invite a coup. They are now studying countermeasures carefully. (Jiji News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The internal strife of the Seiyukai has temporarily reduced its heat on the surface, but the opposition among various factions within has not been resolved. The danger of a recurrence remains. The executives plan to take this opportunity to unite the party and prevent the development of fascist forces in the political world by upholding the policy of parliamentary politics and party politics. The party's central department is attempting to unite political parties for this purpose. Therefore, it prohibits the gatherings of the Kuhara-Tokonami factions and the Daido Danketsu faction. On the one hand, it forcefully controls the movement. (Seiyukai)</p>
<p>Such a change in policy is noteworthy, but whether the internal strife of the party can be eliminated is still questionable. (Jiji News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Many members of the House of Peers originally hoped that Minister of Education Hatoyama would resign voluntarily. However, because the recent inquiry committee of the House of Representatives has the intention of glossing over this issue, influential members of the House of Peers hope to clarify the truth and consider appropriate methods. Mr. Otsuka of the research committee has decided to wait for Prime Minister Saito to attend and ask thorough questions for impeachment, requesting the Prime Minister to consider the impact on social education and take appropriate measures. It is widely believed that if this issue is transferred to the House of Peers, the resignation issue of the Minister of Education will be fatally affected. (Jiji News Agency, 24th)</p>

<p>"Hunger Marchers" Do Not Live Up to Their Name</p>
<p>MacDonald Refuses to Meet with Delegation</p>
<p>Tear Gas Will Be Used If Necessary</p>
<p>Prominent Communist Polit Arrested</p>
<p>(London) The Metropolitan Police are quietly making large-scale preparations to deal with the ten groups of so-called "Hunger Marchers" gathered in London from all over the country. Those in the police force who have applied for leave have now had their leave canceled. It is rumored that a new weapon that Britain has never used before will be used against these people if necessary, probably a gas bomb or the like. The demonstrators will gather in Hyde Park on Sunday to listen to speeches by famous Labour and Socialist leaders on eight platforms. Then they will pass a resolution opposing the unemployment bill currently being debated in Parliament. Polit, a well-known member of the British Communist Party, has been arrested in London on charges of giving inflammatory speeches in Glamorgan last week. Mann, another well-known extremist, has also been detained pending trial for the same offense. Prime Minister MacDonald has refused to meet with the delegation of the Hunger Marchers. His letter of refusal stated that the delegation cannot help unemployment and that the communist aims of such marchers are well known. The unemployment bill submitted to the House of Commons will make comprehensive plans for the unemployment issue and will surely satisfy the public. When the marchers reach the border of the capital, they will hand over their clubs and other items to local officials. These people will probably stay in London for ten days. During these ten days, special police will patrol the streets. The term "Hunger Marchers" is not really appropriate for these people, because they are able to provide for their own meals along the way to London. In addition, they are treated by sympathizers in various places. However, those who suffer from foot swelling, if they visit the places where these people stay, will see that they often wash their feet with hot water and are content and satisfied. One group of them, when they arrived at a certain place, was even given free tickets by the police to spend the afternoon in the cinema, and then received a banquet in the evening before going to bed. Shops near Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square have hired workers to protect their glass windows with thick boards as a precaution, fearing that riots will happen again as they did last time. It is widely believed that no major riots will occur this time, but some people say that turmoil has occurred recently in Paris and Vienna, so why should London be spared? (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>Budapest. The talks between Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich and the Hungarian government authorities concluded today. The Hungarian government issued a statement today saying that Mr. Suvich's visit to Hungary has added another layer of confirmation to the friendship between Italy and Hungary and provided the two countries with a rare opportunity to discuss all issues between them. The statement further said that both sides have reached a complete understanding on all issues during the talks, which will not only consolidate the situation in Central Europe but also pave a new path for peace in Europe. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Budapest. Regarding the matter of Germany, Hungary, and Austria seeking political cooperation, today's official gazette declared that this other international cooperation was not discussed during the negotiations in Budapest and that there was no intention to confront any country or the Little Entente. It is merely an attempt to study ways to restore peace in the Danube region, especially economic peace. (National News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Vienna. Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich arrived here at noon from Budapest and is staying temporarily at the Italian Embassy in Austria. He will depart for home in the evening. Prime Minister Dollfuss made a special trip to the Italian Embassy to visit and conferred with him about the Budapest negotiations and the recent Austrian events before Mr. Suvich left Vienna. (Havas Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Budapest. Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich departed from here at 8 o'clock this morning to return home. (Havas Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Budapest. Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich, who was originally scheduled to depart from Budapest around 11 o'clock tonight, has now postponed his departure until tomorrow morning. Although Hungary has treated Mr. Suvich with great courtesy, the mission of Mr. Suvich's visit is to discuss economic issues among several countries, which is extremely complex and cannot be accomplished without long and careful consultation. Mr. Suvich's postponement of departure is due to unfinished discussions. According to an official gazette, Mr. Suvich's talks in Budapest only opened the door. Mr. Suvich made a statement to the press, saying that large-scale solutions have not been considered. He said, "The issues we discussed are too broad and too large and can only be solved gradually in a concrete spirit." (Havas Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A report, not yet confirmed, has come from Budapest, the capital of Hungary, that since Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich arrived in Budapest, a tentative agreement has been reached regarding the future cooperation of Italy, Austria, and Hungary in economic and political matters. There is considerable skepticism here about this report, as political circles in Berlin believe that there is no sufficient basis for close economic cooperation among these three countries. Even from a political perspective, if a new agreement is completed, it can only be regarded as a new state of the Austrian issue along with all its legal and economic disorders. However, the real solution to the problem is still far away. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Washington) The US silver issue has been investigated in the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, and the general public is paying close attention. According to New York currency expert Mr. Jeppe, the United States now needs 1,000 million yuan of gold and silver to stabilize prices. The US Treasury Department currently has 500 million yuan of gold and 86 million yuan of silver and needs to increase its silver reserves by 400 million yuan. He advocates setting the ratio of gold to silver at twelve to one, which is the natural ratio. Senator Marduke told reporters that the silver issue has gradually become optimistic in recent days. However, according to the opinion of economic expert Mr. Strong, the silver issue is very important and can help restore the gold standard and save countries around the world from the "tragedy of controlled currency."

<p>The Future of Peace is Fraught with Thorns</p>
<p>War Preparations are Realistic</p>
<p>Dark clouds loom over the European continent, and ominous signs gather over the Pacific Ocean. While the actual situation may not be extremely tense, even a superficial observer would recognize that no country dares to provoke lightly. Moreover, the economic crisis has not genuinely turned around. Although the number of unemployed workers has decreased slightly, the crisis is far from over. Therefore, each country has its own concerns and dares not initiate armed conflict to ruin itself. However, they are tightly holding onto military preparations, with a tendency to revert to the armed peace of the pre-1914 era. The public opinion and general populace of the United States are focused on industrial recovery and overcoming the crisis. However, the manufacturing capacity of the United States, which has reached a high degree of development, cannot be expanded solely by relying on the domestic consumer market. Even if it implements the Monroe Doctrine as it had previously defined, including the countries of South America and Canada within the Monroe Doctrine sphere, there are still various problems. The opposition between the United States and Britain is becoming increasingly acute. In other words, the United States' access to foreign markets is being restricted. Furthermore, there is the large market across the Pacific Ocean, where the people generally have a positive impression of the United States, and the market is still largely untapped. In particular, the manufactured goods of heavy industry need to be dominated by the United States.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the United States' economic arrangements in the Far East are still in the preparatory stage. In terms of actual investment, it is far behind Britain and Japan. Therefore, it must quickly catch up and strive to seize the leadership of the Far Eastern market. However, the existing military force to maintain the safety of its investments and ensure the peace of maritime navigation is not only insufficient but also in an inferior position. Assuming that it can use its financial power to control everything in peacetime, it would be difficult for the United States to maintain its detached neutral stance once war breaks out. Therefore, during the industrial recovery period, it is striving to expand military industries, such as the naval shipbuilding program, which is the most obvious example. Moreover,</p>
<p>all countries in the world are striving to strengthen their military equipment, especially the expansion of air forces, which is even more lively. The United States wants to be number one in everything in the world. However, its air force is second to France and is now about to be second to the Soviet Union. In the eyes of Americans, this is extremely embarrassing and also a dangerous matter.</p>
<p>On January 27 of this year, the Department of the Army announced a five-year plan to expand the air force, which aimed to increase the strength of the Army Air Corps by 70 percent. The plan has been reviewed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. At the same time, the House Naval Affairs Committee is also reviewing the Navy's plan to expand its air corps, which will increase the number of aircraft by 66 percent (from approximately 1,000 to 1,660 aircraft). With the Army, Navy, and Air Force responding to each other in this way, the United States Air Force will jump to the top of the world in one fell swoop. It also wants to achieve the highest and greatest strength in combat capability in the world. The general idea of the original proposal is extracted and translated as follows:</p>
<p>1. The current number of aircraft in the United States Army Air Corps is limited to 1,800, and the actual number is less than 1,700. Moreover, many of these 1,700 aircraft are old and in disrepair. It is impossible to participate in a war. Therefore, the current air force must be fundamentally reorganized, and 1,000 of the latest aircraft must be built to cope with any emergencies.</p>
<p>2. With the increase in the number of aircraft, the number of regular air force officers and soldiers must also be increased accordingly. Therefore, 400 air force officers and 6,200 airmen need to be added.</p>
<p>3. A new "Central Air Unit" will be established, bringing together all branches of the army related to aviation, to ensure a complete organization so that the unit can be used for emergency activities in times of emergency. At the same time, this is also an organization that connects with the naval air force, maintaining appropriate liaison between the army and navy.</p>
<p>The proposal also stated that the United States' air force strength, with 1,800 aircraft, cannot be allocated to overseas territories, especially the Philippines and Guam. The necessary flight squadrons and the effective defense of the country are also considered weak. If the expansion is implemented as indicated in the proposal, it will probably be safe and worry-free. (January 30, 1934)</p>

<p>Zhang Breaks into Tangshan Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Publicly Promotes the Puppet Organization</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>A traitor named Zhang suddenly arrived some days ago, behaving secretively. The school detained him and sent him to the Luan Yu Commissioner's Office for interrogation. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM on the 6th of this month, a Zhang Heling suddenly arrived at Tangshan Engineering College, holding a card to request an audience with President Sun. The president sent the chief of general affairs to meet him on his behalf. Zhang arbitrarily promoted the ascension of Emperor Xuantong on March 1st. He claimed that the northeastern provinces were now living in peace and prosperity and that the people everywhere were rejoicing and adoring him. He further claimed that he had been sent by Manchukuo to solicit the opinions of the people in various places. While speaking, he took out a slip of paper from his leather bag, which listed about twenty institutions, including the Public Security Bureau, various banks, and major stores. He said that after visiting the school, he would contact the various institutions and requested a roster of all faculty and staff and students, asking about President Sun's qualifications, age, and so on. The chief of general affairs found Zhang's actions strange. While making a show of courtesy, he reported the information to Director Hua of General Affairs. Director Hua was working in the office at the time and immediately went to inspect. Seeing Zhang's absurd behavior, he was certain that Zhang was a traitor. He immediately called Song, the director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau. However, it was the time when the old and new directors of the Public Security Bureau were handing over. The old director had gone to Tianjin, and the new director had not yet arrived. Zhang overheard the phone call and suddenly burst into a loud scolding, "I am here on official business to inquire about public opinion. Who dares to mistreat me?" While scolding, he prepared to escape. He shouted even louder at the school gate. Since the phone call had no result, Director Hua grabbed his self-defense pistol and chased after him, ordering the school police and messengers to apprehend Zhang. Director Hua then accompanied Zhang to the Luan Yu Commissioner's Office and requested Commissioner Tao to handle the case. After Commissioner Tao interrogated him strictly, Zhang was immediately taken to the Public Security Bureau. It was found that Zhang was from Jinzhou, Fengtian Province, about twenty years old, wearing a blue gown, carrying a cane, wearing leather shoes, and carrying a leather bag. He looked like a government official. It was unexpected that he would willingly betray the country and become a traitor. However, it was thanks to Director Hua's extraordinary courage and knowledge (otherwise, the citizens of Tangshan would have been poisoned).</p>

<h3 id="e122">Bandit Liu Raids Shaanzhou <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>County Magistrate of Lingbao Pleads for Help</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Liu Guitang's bandit troops arrived at Yaikou Village, in the jurisdiction of Luoning County, at 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month, only fifteen li from the city. County Magistrate Qin Shuo, intimidated by the bandit forces, led the Fifth District Militia defending the city and retreated to the south bank of the Luo River. The county security team also left the city and took refuge on the northern mountains. The bandit troops then entered the city safely that night, raping, killing, looting at will. On the morning of the 18th, Tang Junde's troops arrived, and the bandits broke through the encirclement and scattered to the southwest of Lushi and the northwest of Shaanzhou. Caoyuan Town, Zhangbian Town, and other places were disturbed. Zhang Fang, the commander-in-chief of the 20th Route Army, being a native of Xin'an and familiar with the terrain, was ordered to the front to supervise the suppression. He arrived at Guanyintang yesterday (the 21st). Gao Jianbai's troops of the 21st Brigade of the 84th Division stationed in Zhengzhou were also ordered to set out for western Henan today to participate in the bandit suppression. This morning, according to a telegram from Ouyang Zhen, the commissioner of the 11th District of Shaanzhou, Liu's bandits had passed through Yanling Pass and reached Zhangcun Xinzhuang near Guanqian, about forty li from the city, and continued to flee westward. He requested that armored vehicles be sent quickly between Shaanzhou and Lingbao to block them. At the same time, Sun Chunrong, the county magistrate of Lingbao, also telegraphed that Liu's bandits were threatening to attack Lingbao, causing panic among merchants and residents. In addition to deploying security and militia teams to attack decisively at key points, he requested that a large army be sent to Lingbao to suppress them. The panic that had gripped northern Henan a few days ago has now shifted to western Henan. He Zhuguo, who was previously responsible for suppressing Liu's bandits in northern Henan, and Gao Guizi, the commander of the 84th Division, came to Bian yesterday to meet Liu Shi and report on the bandit suppression. They stayed at Weigong Bank, a mountain goods store, and He left Bian to return to his defense today (February 22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e123">Second Phase of Bandit Suppression Begins in Southern Route Army <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Generals Return to their Posts One After Another</p>
<p>Blockade of Bandit Areas Shows Results</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Some days ago, Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army and commander of the First Column of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, returned to Guangdong to discuss the second phase of the plan to suppress the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province. He held several meetings with Chen Jitang to discuss specific measures. At the same time, the deputy division commanders of the various divisions on the front line in southern Jiangxi also successively returned to the province to report on the military situation at the front. The military meetings have now concluded, and the generals have left the province and returned to their defense posts. Yu Hanmou also returned from the province to his hometown of Zhaoqing in western Guangdong yesterday, staying for a day or two before returning to Dageng to preside over the suppression of the communist bandits. Therefore, in recent days, the various troops in southern Jiangxi have been preparing everything. It is reported that in this communist suppression plan, the entire First Column will be sent to eastern Jiangxi, uniting with the Central Army to encircle the bandit areas on a large scale, with the aim of eliminating the remaining communist bandits in Jiangxi in a short period of time. In recent days, Li Zhenqiu's First Division of the First Army, stationed in Nankang, has sent a part of its troops to strengthen the frontline forces. The Teaching Regiment of the Second Division, originally stationed in An Yuan Chongshi Xu, is responsible for searching for the remaining bandits in the front. At 5:00 AM on the 13th of this month, it sent two battalions of soldiers, together with the Second Battalion of the Fifth Regiment, to the vicinity of Heshi to search for and suppress communist bandits who were extorting rice from the people. The farmers in the area were forced to hand over three dou and two sheng of rice per person by the communist bandits, and several hundred shi had already been extorted. The farmers dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Fortunately, the government troops arrived, detected the location of the bandits, and surrounded them without making a sound. The communist bandits and pseudo-guerrillas fled in panic towards Heshi. Numerous bandits were killed on the spot by the government troops, and 300 shi of rice looted by the communist bandits were intercepted and transported back to Chongshi Xu for disposal. The defense troops, knowing that the communist bandits were short of food, have now delineated a blockade line for the bandit areas in southern Jiangxi, strictly blockading it to cut off the supply of food, salt, medicine, and other materials to the communist bandits. The entire blockade line is divided into three sections. In addition to the defense troops stepping up patrols within the line, the militia groups, communist eradication groups, and agency teams within the section must also cooperate to achieve the effect of cooperation between the government and the people. It is estimated that since the implementation of the blockade of the bandit areas, a considerable amount of food, salt, and medicine smuggled by the communist bandits has been intercepted. The Second Division and Fourth Division have successively captured about 500 communist bandits and seized more than 300 machine guns. The remaining bandits are mostly deeply hidden in Huichang and Ruijin. Only a few local communists are active above An Yuan. (February 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e124">Increased Fees for Shipping Donations in Chao Shan <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Communication: The automotive transportation on land in Chao Shan has been quite developed recently, and the business of coastal and inland river electric boats and steamships has been greatly impacted. In addition, the market is cold and freight volume has sharply decreased. The Chao Shan Port Authority recently announced a new chapter on the quarterly dues levied on electric boats and steamships, which is more than doubled compared to the previous one. Those sailing on the Shantou Yangyang Huanggang Shanwei lines used to pay 113 yuan per year, totaling only 400 yuan per year. Now it has increased to 900 yuan per year. The Shantou Chaoyang Dahao route used to pay 907 yuan per quarter, totaling 300 yuan per year. Now the annual fee has increased to 800 yuan. The various ships sailing on the Chaoan Dapu Songkou lines used to pay 75 yuan per quarter, totaling 300 yuan per year. Now it has increased to 600 yuan. The small electric boats on the inland rivers of Chaoyang Lianjiang and Jieyang Mianhu Fugang Tangkeng Yuyao Zhongtang used to pay 37 yuan per quarter, totaling 100 yuan per year. Now it has also increased to 312 yuan. At the end of the lunar year, the Chao Shan Wheel Electric Association specially petitioned the provincial government to establish a building hall, requesting exemption to maintain transportation, but it has not yet been approved. As a result, since the new year, most of the company's electric boats have been suspended.</p>

<p>Songjiang is a rice-producing area. The rice market is concentrated in three locations: Xitan, Da Zhangjing, and Dongmen. Xitan has the largest business in the rice market, followed by Da Zhangjing. The annual total is more than 400,000 to 500,000 dan. However, rice prices have been low for many years, and rice operators often hear of losses. At the end of last year, several companies suffered excessive losses and went bankrupt. There were seven bankruptcies in Xitan and one in Dongmen, Wanchang Rice Store. Due to the impact of the rice market, the following businesses went bankrupt: Dongmen Shuntaiyi Lumber Store, and four old stores on West Avenue, Tong Jinchang Cai Zhang Yuan Fengchang Zhang. They are all old stores that have been in business for many years, but they are unwilling to continue operating due to years of losses. This is enough to show the sluggishness of Songjiang's business.</p>

Since the area was under the jurisdiction of Wujiang County, the county reported to the Wuxian District Court, which sent personnel to inspect and send the body to the Zhenru Inspection Office for examination. The results showed that the deceased had blue and purple marks on his shoulders and neck. Tang Hang was sentenced to life imprisonment, and her brother Hang was sentenced to seven years. Tang Hang and others were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (the 24th), the sentence was pronounced.

Yesterday (the 24th) at 11:00 AM, Zhu Jun, the prosecutor of the Suzhou High Court, opened the court to investigate. Jia and Xu were present in court, but Aisha was not present. As a result, the evidence presented by Jia and Xu was not strong enough. The court ordered that Aisha be summoned for further review of the case and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be requested to provide the file for review.</p>

All waterways and the horizontal line of the Zhongdu Mountain section have also been surveyed. Construction is scheduled to begin within days. The most important part of the entire road construction is the bridge project. A long levee will be built between Baishizui and Sujiazui, connected by bridges, to make the road circular. When the road construction is completed in the future, the scenery will not be inferior to the Su Causeway, Bai Causeway, the Six Bridges, and the Three Temples.</p>

<p>Ji Naizhen, the principal of the 江都 County Middle School, illegally constructed a school building. Citizens Zou Fengming and Sun Baoqin believed that he had arbitrarily started the project and misappropriated huge sums of money, and they separately filed complaints with the Provincial Government Construction Department. The Provincial Government has now received a joint report from the Construction and Education Departments on this case and specially ordered the 江都 County Government, stating that the county middle school had allocated a large amount of money for the construction of the school building without first submitting the drawings and detailed accounts of the project to the Education Department for approval before allocating the funds. The principal also failed to supervise the contracting craftsmen to obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations before starting construction, which were all inappropriate. It should be reprimanded together. Since it has been reported that the construction project of the school is urgently needed, in addition to ordering the county magistrate to order the supplementary issuance of licenses in accordance with the construction regulations of the province, the construction drawings and detailed accounts of the project should also be submitted for review. The county government has now complied with the order and transferred it to the Education Bureau for handling. Yesterday (the 22nd), the plaintiffs Zou Fengming and Sun Baoqin had recorded the approval order of the Provincial Government and submitted it to the county, requesting that it be handled in accordance with the regulations and that the case be investigated and punished.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Impressionistic Notes on an Economic Survey of Guangxi Province (Part 1) by Qian Jiaju <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>This time, at the invitation of the Guangxi Provincial Government, we went to Guangxi Province to investigate the province's economic situation. The trip lasted six months. We are deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of the provincial authorities. The materials obtained are currently being organized, and a Guangxi economic survey report will be submitted and officially published by the Social Survey Institute soon. Now, I will record my personal observations and feelings during the journey, hoping to provide some reference for those who are concerned about the construction problems of Guangxi Province."</p>
<p>Guangxi is a province in the southwestern border area, with an area of ​​over 84,000 square miles and a population of approximately 12 million. Because its southwestern corner is adjacent to French Annam, it occupies a very important position in national defense. However, due to its remote location and obstructed transportation, it is naturally more backward than Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces in terms of its economy or culture. However, since the cooperation between Guangdong and Guangxi twenty years ago, the authorities of the province have been able to diligently seek governance and work hard on construction after the military devastation. In a short period of time, remarkable achievements have been made. For a time, the title of "New Guangxi" was well-known throughout the country, and the economy, politics, and construction of Guangxi Province have gradually attracted the attention of the people across the country. This time, we were invited by the provincial authorities to conduct an economic survey of the entire province to provide a reference for Guangxi's future economic construction. We have long admired the landscape of Guilin, which is known as the best in the world. Secondly, we felt that it was worth visiting such a new province. Therefore, we happily accepted the order and decided to depart from Beiping in early July of last year. Before departure, we started various preparations for the survey, such as collecting records of political and economic problems in Guangxi from various newspapers and magazines, and collecting economic survey forms from various academic institutions. My colleagues were Mr. Wu Bannong and Mr. Han Dezhang, and myself. Because I had some personal matters to go back to my hometown in Zhejiang, I set off from Beiping on June 20 and stayed in Wuyi for a week. I returned to Shanghai on July 5. It happened that at this time, Mr. Wu and Mr. Han also came to Shanghai from Beiping. After contacting Mr. Huang Jianping, the Guangxi representative in Shanghai, we immediately purchased second-class tickets for the Italian postal ship "Conte Verde" which departed on July 14. The fare for the ship to Hong Kong was 97 yuan and 60 cents. At the same time, Mr. Huang Jianping telegraphed our itinerary to Mr. Li Baihuang. Mr. Wu and Mr. Han heard from Mr. Zhang Xinyi in Nanjing that the climate in Guangxi Province was warm and hot, and there were many seasonal diseases and miasma. In order to prevent problems before they occurred, we got vaccinated against cholera and typhoid fever before leaving Shanghai. We also purchased a large number of medicines, such as quinine, ten drops of water, and Jizhong water. After everything was arranged, we boarded the ship at 9:00 am on the 14th. At 1:00 pm, the crew sailed from the Pudong Wharf. When she left this prosperous and tense city, our hearts felt extraordinarily relaxed, but when we thought that she was carrying us further away from Beiping, we felt a little melancholy. The Italian Post is a rising star in the Euro-Asian route, especially the second-class cabin of Conte Verde, which is said to be originally a part of the first-class cabin and is specially designed for "higher-class Chinese" to ride. Therefore, the cabins are elegant and comfortably furnished, and the Saloon is especially magnificent. After boarding the ship, we realized that there was also a second-class economy cabin, which cost only 60 yuan to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>We didn't buy the economy class this time, which was really a bit bourgeois.</p>
<p>On the ship, Mr. Zhang introduced us to Mr. Lei Binnan, the current Director of Education of Guangxi Province. Mr. Lei is a well-known popular educator in China's education circle, and also a senior in the revolutionary circle. In the Smoking Room, he and we painfully discussed the shortcomings of the Chinese education system, which only cultivated a group of higher-class idlers who have nothing to do with social production. This time, the highest authorities in Guangxi originally asked Mr. Lei to be the Director of Education, but his own plan was to return to Guangxi to establish a National Production Education College (the name is yet to be determined). Mr. Lei expressed warm welcome to our economic survey work, because when the first administrative meeting of Guangxi was held last year, he first proposed that Guangxi should establish an economic committee. The initial work of the committee was to conduct field surveys, and then make a plan for the economic construction of the province based on the survey materials. Therefore, the help and guidance we received from Mr. Lei along the way and after arriving in Guangxi was indeed not insignificant.</p>
<p>The time on the ship passed quickly in conversation or looking into the distance. At 5:00 pm on the second day, there was also music in the second-class Saloon. According to Mr. Han Dezhang (who is proficient in music), Suauss's Enjoy Life Verde Ajda and Moskowsky's Spanish Dances were all famous songs, but unfortunately I am a genuine layman, which is really no different from "playing the lute to a cow." At 9:00 pm, there was also a sound movie, titled Terra Madre (Mother Earth), but the film was not very good, and the language was Italian, so I couldn't understand the plot. Before the end of the show, we went back to the room to sleep. After waking up and washing up, and tidying up our luggage, Hong Kong was already vaguely visible. We had read Lu Xun's experience of passing through Hong Kong before, knowing that when going ashore in Hong Kong, there are special high-class nationals who check the luggage of Chinese people. If you don't bribe them with money, they may turn your suitcase upside down or poke seven holes in it. This time, we brought a lot of luggage, and we couldn't help but feel uneasy, so we asked in advance how much gift each piece of luggage had to pay to the inspectors, so as not to be at a loss when the time came. At this time, Mr. Huang Xianru told us that if there was too much luggage, there was also a way to avoid the trouble of the inspectors, that is, to let someone stay at the Hongkong Hotel for one night, because the tea boys who serve guests at the Hongkong Hotel are blue-eyed and only need to hand over the luggage to him, and you will not be inspected, because inspection has always been applied only to compatriots. This is indeed a clever way, but because we had already decided to stay at the Queen's Hotel, and the room rate at the Hongkong Hotel was too expensive, it was inconvenient to live separately, so we didn't do that. At 12:00 noon, the ship docked at the Royal Wharf. At this time, a large number of coolies (dockworkers) swarmed in, their momentum was fierce, as if facing a battlefield. None of the three of us could speak Cantonese, fortunately, Mr. Lei Binnan came to greet us. After a lot of talking, we spent more than six yuan in total for inspection fees and porterage fees, and finally got the luggage safely moved to the Queen's Hotel. After the room was settled, we took Mr. Huang Jianping's letter of introduction to the Hong Kong Guangxi Bank to see Mr. Zeng Qixin and Mr. Zhang Zhaotang, the president and vice president. Who knew that today was just a Sunday and the bank was closed. After waiting for a long time, we finally invited Mr. Zhang, the vice president. However, Mr. Zhang did not seem to understand the task of our trip, and only said, "Commander-in-chief Li is also in Hong Kong. Would you like to meet him?" Of course we wanted to meet Mr. Li, so we asked Mr. Zhang to arrange a time to meet Mr. Li and notify us by phone at night. After coming out of the Guangxi Bank, we went to see Mr. Li Feng, a friend introduced to us by Mr. Chen Junhui, a colleague of our bank. Mr. Li is the manager of the Yong Coffee Company (in Hong Kong, managers are called "Sili"). He treated us very sincerely. He said that the next day was the date of their company's delivery, and he couldn't spare time to accompany us, so he wanted to entrust a friend from the Youth Association, Mr. Liu, to be our guide for touring Hong Kong. After returning to the hotel, we received a call from Manager Zhang at night, saying that he had arranged to meet Mr. Li at his home at 7:00 am the next morning.</p>
<p>An interesting thing happened at the Queen's Hotel. At 8:00 or 9:00 pm, a tea boy ran in and asked one of our colleagues if he wanted to smoke opium. Our colleague shook his head, and he walked away dejectedly. After a while, he poked his head in again. We asked him what he was doing. He said, "Do you gentlemen want to call a girl to relieve boredom?" We gave him another cold shoulder. From then on, the waiter's response was no longer responsive and the service was also simplified. We naturally had to listen to it. The situation of Hong Kong hotels can also be imagined in general.</p>

<p>Belgian Envoy Arrived in Shanghai Last Night: The Belgian Envoy, Mr. Guillaume de Lichtervelde and his wife, were extremely saddened after learning of the shocking news of the Belgian King. On the one hand, they telegraphed the Consul-General in Shanghai to prepare for holding a memorial service in Shanghai. On the other hand, they immediately packed their luggage and went south. They took the Shanghai-Beiping train from Beiping on the morning of the 23rd and passed through Nanjing yesterday afternoon. They arrived at the North Railway Station at 11:00 pm.

<h3 id="e136">Song Ziwen Talks About the Silver Agreement <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Stabilizing Silver Prices is the Same as the Current Situation</p>
<p>Reducing Orders for American Cotton is Currently Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, received reporters from various newspapers at the office of the Economic Council on West Yanan Road yesterday morning and made important remarks on various issues such as silver. He said that the silver agreement does not violate social psychology, and expressed that he himself will enter Nanjing next week, and plans to go to the Northwest with Dai Jitao next month. As for the American cotton and wheat loan, the amount of cotton loan will be reduced as much as possible. The details of Mr. Song's remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation and Psychology Change Very Quickly: Regarding the silver issue, Mr. Song said that in the past three or four years, its price has fluctuated greatly. Three or four years ago, its decline was the most severe. At that time, the general public thought that silver had been abandoned internationally and had no way out, so it flooded into China. Therefore, some people advocated banning the import of silver. Recently, the price of silver has shown an increasing trend, so some people advocated banning the export of silver. The situations before and after are completely opposite. I am afraid that the most vocal advocates of banning the export of silver now may also be the most vocal advocates of banning the import of silver before. The speed of changes in the situation and psychology is so rapid.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Silver Agreement: As for the purpose of the London Silver Agreement, it is to stabilize silver prices, which is already known to the people of the country. The biggest reason for the sharp drop in silver prices a few years ago was that India abandoned the silver standard and sold a huge amount of silver to the international market. According to last year's statistics, India still has 400 million ounces of silver after abolishing the silver standard. At the same time, Spain also has a large amount of silver circulating in the market. Therefore, the silver agreement stipulates that India, Spain, and other countries that have changed from the silver standard to the gold standard shall not sell more than 35 million ounces of silver each year. At the same time, silver-producing countries such as Mexico, the United States, and Canada shall each purchase 35 million ounces of silver from the national treasury each year. China shall also not sell the silver stored in the government treasury to the market in order to balance the supply of silver and stabilize silver prices. The general public now hopes that our country's silver will not flow out. The London Silver Agreement is based on this meaning, so it does not violate social psychology.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Criticize Countermeasures: As for the amount of silver owned by China, it is not much. In addition to the hard currency preserved by the Central Bank, there is no so-called national treasury silver. What is referred to in the agreement is that in the future, or after our country changes to the gold standard, if there is excess silver, it will flow out to foreign countries. As for the recent reminting of silver coins in the United States and the statements of the banking industry, the government will naturally have competent authorities to decide on major policies. As the former Minister of Finance, I am reluctant to make any criticisms or speculations due to my position.</p>
<p>The Purpose of the Previously Promulgated Silver Tax: As for the issue of levying a silver export tax, Mr. Song only stated that the purpose of the previously promulgated 2.25% silver export tax was purely to add a minting fee of 2.25% to the value of the national standard silver currency after the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, in addition to the pure silver content. Foreign merchants are unwilling to use silver coins, but still use silver taels, because silver taels have no minting fee burden, which is relatively cost-effective. Therefore, it is stipulated that silver taels are subject to export tax, while silver coins are exempt, in order to unify their value, make the national currency flow smoothly, and unify the currency system, without any intention of restricting silver exports.</p>
<p>Negotiating to Reduce American Cotton Quota: Subsequently, reporters inquired about the American cotton and wheat loan. The contract stipulated 40 million US dollars for American cotton. It is heard that only more than 6 million gold yuan have been shipped to our country, and the balance is still as high as more than 30 million yuan. Our country's market situation does not have such a large purchasing power. How will the original loan contract be modified? Mr. Song replied that when the loan contract was signed last year, our country's yarn mills had a large demand for American cotton. Later, due to the bumper harvest of cotton in our country last year, the demand for foreign cotton was greatly reduced, resulting in failure to purchase according to the contract. We are currently discussing with American merchants to reduce the quantity. The detailed amount is still under negotiation, roughly based on the needs of our country's market. Reporters also asked whether the cotton quota would be used to purchase other goods after the reduction. Mr. Song did not answer.</p>
<p>Entering Nanjing Next Week and Going to the Northwest: Mr. Song continued, regarding the allocation of business expenses of the National Economic Council, I went to Hangzhou last time and exchanged opinions in detail with General Jiang. Next week, I will go to Nanjing to discuss with Mr. Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, and Kong Yongzhi again before a decision can be made. In the Northwest, in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, the Economic Council is planning to engage in construction projects such as developing water conservancy and building roads. I recently want to go to Shaanxi and Gansu to see their economic situation as a basis for engaging in economic construction. Mr. Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, is very enthusiastic about developing the Northwest and plans to travel with him to inspect Shaanxi and Gansu in the middle of next month. After inspecting Shaanxi and Gansu, he also plans to go to Sichuan, because the Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces occupy an important position in the future revival of our country's economic construction.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Should an Export Tax Be Levied After the United States Raises Silver Prices? <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's Financial Circles Are Also Divided</p>
<p>Those Who Advocate Tax Collection: A reporter from the Central News Agency learned yesterday morning that the US government's reminting of silver coins and efforts to raise silver prices are of great importance to the interests of our country. They specifically inquired with financial circles in Shanghai about the benefits and harms that our country will experience after silver prices rise. Our country is a silver standard country. The rise in silver prices will invisibly increase the amount of wealth in our country. This is an inevitable trend. Moreover, our country has a huge amount of foreign debt. The exchange rate at the time of repayment of foreign debt varies greatly depending on the price of silver. This is the benefit that our country can experience after silver prices rise. Other benefits, such as the ability of our country's merchants to take advantage of this good opportunity to compete for the export of domestic goods after silver prices rise, are also not insignificant. As for its harm, it is a hundred times greater than this. After silver prices rise, the outflow of silver is inevitable and there is no way to prevent it. Since the US government announced its plan to raise silver prices, the Shanghai banking community has telegraphed US President Roosevelt to state its opinions, but has not yet received a reply. However, it is expected that this plan of the US government is likely to be implemented. A telegram from Shanghai's banking community may be of little use. Therefore, the most important task now is to plan what methods to use to stop the domestic outflow of silver once the US government implements its plan to raise silver prices. There is really no other way than to levy an export tax on silver. As for the regulation of the tax rate, it should be increased or decreased at any time. For example, if the silver price increases by 20%, then the tax rate must also be increased to 20% so that silver transporters have no profit to be made. It is also necessary to stipulate that those who smuggle silver for export should be punished with extreme penalties. However, it is feared that the export of silver cannot be completely prohibited. Our country is an importing country and must use silver to order foreign goods. As for someone saying that domestic prices can also be raised after silver prices rise, this is enough to harm ourselves, because the economic panic in China has reached its peak, purchasing power is weak, resulting in stockpiles of goods, and the decline of the rural economy is in urgent need of relief. Raising prices will put all industries in the country in a more difficult situation.</p>
<p>Those Who Doubt Tax Collection: Xin Sheng News Agency reported that since the banking community in Shanghai expressed opposition to the US policy of raising silver prices, all parties have expressed their opinions except for the government authorities, who have expressed their consideration. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency quoted a banker yesterday as saying that US President Roosevelt's purpose of raising silver prices is actually one of the policies of the recovery plan to relieve unemployment. Therefore, the opposition from Shanghai's banking community is only to express our country's attitude in order to attract their attention. If it is said that this telegram can make the United States change its policy, there is actually no such possibility. Therefore, the majority of the US President in Congress has approved the implementation of this policy. Under this situation, the telegram from our country's silver community is inconvenient to express its attitude, so Mr. Roosevelt is unlikely to reply. As for our country's countermeasures, some advocate levying a silver export tax to show resistance, but the silver itself fluctuates up and down with the market price at any time and has no fixed price, so it cannot be the same as other tax collection methods. It is impossible to determine the tax rate as a percentage. Therefore, even if there is a possibility of implementation, it cannot be done without detailed research because the difficulty lies in the complexity. However, in terms of the US raising silver prices, the impact on our country is also bound to be very profound. Our country's biggest shortcoming is that production is backward. The US raising silver prices is to suppress its freight prices in order to find a way out for its surplus production. Our country has always been a exporting country, exchanging goods for goods, so how can silver flow out? In recent years, even the only two major exports of silk and tea have been in decline, so the only way to remedy the situation in the future is to hope for political stability and strive to increase production.</p>

<p>Denies Holding Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting yesterday (23rd) to discuss the silver issue and resolved to telegraph President Roosevelt to request careful handling. According to an official of the Chamber of Commerce, the meeting yesterday afternoon was a routine annual meeting and not an emergency meeting. At that time, only new directors were elected and a decision was made to reduce the annual membership fee. The silver issue was not involved at all. The telegraph to the US President was not true. However, at noon yesterday, the outgoing board of directors held a meeting and elected several American business representatives in Shanghai to form a committee to investigate the silver incident in order to contribute opinions to the new board of directors, with Mr. Hoskins as the chairman. The new chairman of the board, Mr. Filangieri, has already sent letters to various newspapers today to correct the misinterpretation.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Guangdong: Two Round-Trips Each Week</p>
<p>Wuhan-Chongqing: Three Round-Trips Each Week</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation ordered a new aircraft from the United States for use on the Shanghai-Guangdong route. After it was shipped to Shanghai, it has been fully assembled. The Shanghai-Guangdong route is scheduled to resume its original flights on March 2. At the same time, the Wuhan-Chongqing route is scheduled to increase flights on March 5. The company's announcement of the changes to the flight schedules of the two routes is recorded in the following table:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Route: The company previously ordered a new aircraft from the United States for use on the Shanghai-Guangdong route, and it has now been assembled. It is now scheduled to change the flights on this route to two round-trips each week, starting on March 2. The dates are as follows: Tuesdays and Fridays from Shanghai to Guangzhou, Wednesdays and Saturdays from Guangzhou to Xiamen, Thursdays and Sundays from Xiamen back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wuhan-Chongqing Route: The company has found that passengers and mail on the Wuhan-Chongqing route have been extremely crowded recently, causing passengers to often miss out. In order to meet the needs of all parties, it has specially increased the flights on this route to three round-trips each week, starting on March 5. The dates are as follows: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from Wuhan to Chongqing, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from Chongqing to Wuhan.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Li Jingcong Returns to Shanghai to Talk About the Test Flight on the Beiping-Shaanxi Route <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Decides to Start Flights Next Month</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jingcong, Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, flew from Shanghai to Beiping on the 5th of this month to test fly the Beiping-Shaanxi route. He flew from Beiping to Taiyuan on the 19th, arrived in Xi'an on the 21st, and went to Hankou via Xiangyang and Fancheng on the 22nd. At around 10:00 am the day before yesterday, he returned from Hubei and passed through Nanjing at around 3:00 pm. He arrived in Shanghai at around 6:00 pm that night. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically went to the company yesterday morning to inquire about the results of this trip. According to him, this trip from Taiyuan to Xi'an was a direct flight, because the area is full of continuous mountains, so the flight was more difficult. The section from Xi'an to Xiangfan was covered in dense fog that day, so the flight was at an altitude of 3,500 feet. The sky was full of white clouds and Xiangfan was not visible, so it did not land. It has now been decided to start flights from next month, and to test the local climate route and add equipment at any time to ensure safety. In the future, if the weather is bad on the section from Beiping to Xi'an and it is inconvenient to fly directly over the mountains, then a test will be conducted from Beiping along the Beiping-Hankou Railway via Zhengding and then west, following the Zhengtai Railway to fly. From Taiyuan to Xi'an, the Fen River will be followed. However, the result is unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Naming and Machine Conferral Ceremony of Four Airplanes <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>To be held simultaneously on the 11th of next month</p>
<p>It has been decided that the Tianchu Main and Auxiliary Airplanes, as well as the two airplanes donated by Du Yuesheng to Sun Tonggang and the Aviation Flying Club, will have their naming and donation ceremony held at the Hongqiao Airfield on March 11th. The China Aviation Association is currently preparing for this event. The Flying Club under the Association is also scheduled to be officially established at the beginning of March. This Shin Shi News reporter met with Mr. Lin Wo Jiang yesterday, who provided the following information:</p>
<p>Naming Ceremony Scheduled for Tianchu Airplane: The Tianchu airplane, donated by the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, was damaged during a test flight last year. Chan Cheong &amp; Co. has provided a new airplane and subsidized a training aircraft. These two airplanes are now named Tianchu Main and Auxiliary. According to Mr. Lin Wo Jiang, the Secretary-General of the China Aviation Association, the two airplanes will be named on the afternoon of March 11th at Hongqiao Airfield. The Tianchu Main airplane will be received by the National Government, and the Tianchu Auxiliary airplane will be donated to the Aviation Association. The Aviation Association is responsible for all the preparations for the ceremony. The airplanes donated by this city in Hangzhou will fly to Shanghai to participate in the grand ceremony and provide a performance. The government will also send high-ranking officials to Shanghai to participate.</p>
<p>Du's Airplane Donation Ceremony Held Simultaneously: Du Yuesheng previously donated a French-style airplane to Sun Tonggang. Because the horsepower of the airplane was very low, and the model was relatively old, it was not suitable for long-distance flights. To show his support for promoting aviation, Du specially purchased a new model airplane to donate to Sun. Mr. Sun has already come to Shanghai and has consulted with the Aviation Association to hold the donation ceremony for the Tianchu Main and Auxiliary airplanes at the same time. Mr. Sun will also formally donate the airplane that Du previously donated to the Aviation Association's Flying Club on that day, as a training aircraft for the club, to express his enthusiasm for promoting the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Flying Club Scheduled to be Established Next Month: The China Flying Club, initiated by Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Wo Jiang, Xu Peigen, Wang Zhengting, Sun Tonggang, and others, has been mostly prepared. It has been agreed with the Aviation Administration to use Hongqiao Airfield as a training ground and has rented houses and grounds near the airfield. Funding has been secured. Detailed procedures and organization for joining the Flying Club will be announced within this week. The club is scheduled to be officially established at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Aviation Association Relocation Completed: The China Aviation Association, formerly located at the Astor House, has moved its offices to a foreign-style house at No. 9, Lane 177, Luban Road in the French Concession, as the lease has expired. The relocation was officially completed yesterday morning. The preparatory office of the Flying Club is also temporarily located there.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The National Cement Federation Reiterates Relief Opinions <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Cement Severely Affected by Doubled Unified Tax</p>
<p>Again Begging for the Withdrawal of the Order to Alleviate Difficulties</p>
<p>The National Cement Manufacturers Association believes that its business has been severely affected since the unified tax was doubled. It previously submitted a request to the Tax Department to find a way to cancel the tax payments that were made after the increase, but the Tax Department rejected it, stating that it was a general case. The Association submitted another request to the Tax Department yesterday, listing the difficulties of the business and requesting a way to remedy the situation. The original request is as follows: The case is about the doubled unified tax severely impacting domestic cement, respectfully reiterating opinions, and again begging for adoption to provide relief. The case was investigated by the association before the unified tax rate was ordered to be doubled, which has caused extremely serious damage to domestic people's livelihood. Therefore, a request was submitted to your office to respectfully request the withdrawal of the order to alleviate the difficulties. Your approval No. 189 stated (omitted)... Upon receiving this, it was investigated that China's cement industry is still in its infancy. Apart from the major commercial ports, sales are inherently limited. Compared to</p>
<p>Times of unrest and impoverished people's livelihood, most construction is stagnant. Therefore, cement sales are particularly affected. The output of various factories is oversupplied. Although the increased tax amount is borne by consumers, as your approval states, users will inevitably seek alternatives except for absolutely necessary uses, due to the increased burden. Therefore, the stagnation of cement sales is expected. However, the request to withdraw the order was not granted. Under the approval, the association is hesitant. The association also knows that the government's increase in the tax rate this time is unavoidable. If there were not many obstacles, the association would be willing to reluctantly endure the difficulties. Considering that the impact of heavy taxes on sales is as described above, the more stagnant the sales, the higher the cost, which will make it more difficult for factories to maintain their operations, and the more dangerous the future of industry and people's livelihood. If the government is not requested to find other relief measures, the resulting harm will be unspeakable. The association feels the danger and dares to submit the following opinions for relief:</p>
<p>Extended Period for Tax Account Booking: Most of the cement produced by the companies is stored in warehouses or distributed for sale, not sold immediately. However, the tax must be paid first. Even for the goods purchased by customers, the unified tax that should be paid is paid in advance by the companies due to credit sales. After the tax increase, the advance payment is even greater, and the companies have great difficulty in turning around their funds. The approval stated that there is a tax account booking system for paying the unified tax. If the manufacturers can find a bank guarantee, they can be allowed to book the tax, so they will not be subject to the difficulty of paying the unified tax in advance. It is deeply appreciated that your office is considerate of the difficulties of the business. However, the traditional tax account booking system has very strict restrictions. All tax account bookings must be paid by the 25th of each month. In reality, the companies must recover the tax paid in advance from customers in installments at the earliest two to three months later. For goods stored in warehouses or distributed for sale, it depends on the market conditions, so the recovery of the advance payment will take even longer. Therefore, even with the tax account booking system, the companies still cannot avoid the difficulty of paying the tax in advance. It is dared to request that the tax booking period be extended to three months, so that the companies can slightly ease</p>
<p>the burden.</p>
<p>Restricting the Import of Foreign Cement: The import and dumping of foreign cement have been very large in recent years. Although the government increased the import tax last May to show restriction, according to the customs trade book, the import of cement last year still reached 800,000 to 900,000 barrels, including those imported after last May. Considering that domestic cement production is already oversupplied, sales will be reduced even more after the increase in the unified tax. In order to maintain the domestic industry, it is hoped that other relief measures will be taken for the domestic cement that is reduced in sales due to this tax increase. The proposed method of relief is to request the government to strictly restrict the import of foreign goods and to review and increase the import tax rate again, in order to gradually reduce the import of cement, so that the reduced sales of domestic products can be slightly offset.</p>
<p>Please Reward Domestic Cement Immediately: Domestic cement has no sales in terms of exports due to transportation difficulties and foreign competition. Now that domestic sales are difficult to maintain due to the increased unified tax, the surplus of domestic cement should be developed separately. Overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands are enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>For example, overseas Chinese in the Dutch Indies also sent a telegram last October to purchase a large number of domestic cement, but the price offered was far below the cost of the companies, and the transaction could not be completed. As a result, Japanese goods were still used. The association's intention is to request the government to allocate all of the increased import tax in the previous article to be used for export cement subsidies, so that domestic cement can be sold as much as possible in the Nanyang region. The government has nothing to lose, and the domestic industry will benefit greatly.</p>
<p>Revision of the Refund of Heavy Taxes: It is clearly stipulated in the unified tax regulations and cement unified tax collection regulations that cement that has already paid taxes shall not be subject to any other taxes in the unified tax area. However, Guangdong Province must re-levy a university donation of 90 cents per barrel and a telephone donation of 45 cents per barrel, totaling 1.35 yuan, for imported cement, which exceeds the recently revised unified tax rate by 15 cents per barrel. It is heard that Guangdong Province will follow up with an increase after this central tax increase. However, the cement produced by factories such as Xicun in Guangdong Province is not taxed. If this continues, the association's sales in Guangdong Province will be completely cut off. The association has repeatedly appealed for correction to share the burden. Although the Ministry of Finance's tax letter No. 1697 stipulates that the original unified tax can be refunded in full, it is considered that there is no actual loss for the manufacturers. However, the amount of the heavy tax levied in Guangdong Province is very different from the original actual tax. If not in accordance with,</p>
<p>The full amount of the heavy tax levied should be refunded. It is still not enough to show fairness and avoid losses. This issue is not only related to the survival of the association's companies, but also has a profound impact on the national legal credibility. It is hoped that a speedy correction will be made, and that the heavy taxes levied in Guangdong Province will be fully refunded before the tax system is unified. If other provinces have heavy taxes that exceed the original unified tax, it should also be allowed to follow suit to provide relief. The above sections are all essential plans for rescuing the domestic cement industry. The interests of the association's companies are truly skin deep. The association has always felt painful. Now that the tax rate has been increased, it is even more difficult to pay the tax in advance and promote the products. Without the consideration of your office to plan together, it is truly not enough to save the difficulties and maintain the industry. Therefore, the association dares to continue to state the facts and begs for verification and compliance to comfort the public's expectations and be deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to Xie, the Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Association for the Maintenance of National Products Requests the Abolition of Special Taxes on Porcelain <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The tax rate is extremely heavy, no different from Likin</p>
<p>Domestic products are in danger, please provide relief</p>
<p>The Association for the Maintenance of National Products of China submitted a document to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, stating, "Recently, according to the Joint Association of Porcelain Merchants in Jingdezhen and various guild halls, the porcelain merchants and others recently read the Shanghai News on December 26, 1933, which published an order from the Executive Yuan's Rural Rehabilitation Committee to all people's groups in the country, stating in brief that, 'It has been decreed by the Executive Yuan that to rehabilitate the countryside, it is necessary to first abolish exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes, and to abolish exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes, it is especially necessary to have a detailed investigation. The central government and the people are starting anew, and a decision has been made early on. It is hoped that the people and various groups in all regions will, based on their actual observations, make detailed reports. This matter concerns the foundation of the country, and we look forward to it,' etc. After reading it, we see that the central government is concerned about the people's difficulties, clearing away abuses, and sparing no effort. The porcelain merchants and others see this telegram as if they were experiencing a cloudburst in a severe drought, or a patient meeting a good doctor. How can we not be grateful? The Jiangxi Provincial Government launched a post-banditry production and sales donation in 1932, and Jingdezhen porcelain was also included in the levy. This donation is a disguised Likin. The porcelain merchants and others immediately, based on the central government's explicit order issued on January 1, 1931, to permanently abolish Likin and all donations similar to Likin, repeatedly argued and repeatedly submitted to the central government's various Yuan and Ministries, which approved the issuance of orders to abolish it. However, the Jiangxi Provincial Government stated that during the bandit suppression period, military expenses were vast and difficult to abolish. The porcelain production and sales donation was changed to a special business tax on porcelain, and the porcelain merchants were responsible for contracting the annual amount of 440,000 yuan. At this time, the porcelain merchants and others were unable to bear the burden, but because the government was having difficulty raising funds, they had to comply with this intention and bear the pain, hoping to abolish it as soon as possible. However, more than a year has passed, and the tax is still the same. The suffering of the porcelain merchants and others is indescribable. At the end of last year, we submitted the details in writing to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting approval to order the abolition. Now, we will reiterate to your association the serious relationship between the collection of the special business tax on porcelain, the decline of industry and commerce, and the endangerment of national products, as well as the special circumstances of the urgent need to abolish the tax. Jingdezhen porcelain is a national product that has enjoyed a great reputation in our country for more than ten years. The porcelain merchants and others purchase and transport it here, on the one hand, to promote national products and avoid the outflow of rights, and on the other hand, to supply the daily necessities of the people in various provinces of our country. However, since many years, although there are no tariffs, we are affected by natural and man-made disasters and the dumping of foreign porcelain. Not only is foreign trade unable to stand, but even the domestic market is almost taken away. A glimmer of hope is on the verge of extinction. Moreover, with the addition of heavy donations and taxes, it is difficult for porcelain merchants to survive. This is the first reason why the special business tax on porcelain should be abolished. In the era of special taxes, the tax rate for daily necessities was 5% to 5.5%, luxury goods 7.5% to 10%, and luxury goods 12% to 17.5%. It was only collected once locally and could be used throughout the country. The porcelain merchants and others still felt it was harsh and difficult to bear. Now, the special business tax on porcelain is being held, and it is also being levied according to the special tax rate. It is a separate system in Jiangxi Province. When porcelain is transported to various provinces and ports, a business tax must be collected again, so the burden is heavier than in the era of special taxes. Think about it, if porcelain merchants buy porcelain with 100 yuan of capital, they must pay at least 20 to 30 yuan in special business tax on porcelain and business tax in various provinces and ports. Adding in transportation costs of about 30 yuan, 40 to 50 yuan has been lost invisibly with 100 yuan of capital, and it is difficult to hope that they will not lose their capital. Therefore, foreign porcelain takes advantage of the situation to encroach, and domestic porcelain is gradually declining. This is the second reason why the special business tax on porcelain should be abolished. In terms of production and sales of Jingdezhen porcelain last year, it plummeted compared to previous years due to the restrictions of donations and taxes. It is truly rare in decades, and the public is panicked. In addition, the recent Min Province coup has affected the situation. Porcelain merchants in various provinces lack purchasing power. However, seeing the difficulties of the times and feeling heartbroken, they have stopped buying from the kiln owners. Due to the accumulation of porcelain and the inability to transport it, they have stopped working. Many workers have lost their jobs, and the local market has become stagnant. Cries of hunger and cold are often heard. If it is not abolished in time, it is no different from draining the pond to catch fish and burning the forest to hunt. This is the third reason why the special business tax on porcelain should be abolished. Jingdezhen porcelain is made by hand, with the finest division of labor. Hundreds of thousands of workers rely on this for their livelihoods. If the porcelain industry goes bankrupt and cuts off the livelihood, these people with limited knowledge will inevitably take risks. Moreover, the area is adjacent to bandit areas, and hidden dangers are worrying. This is the fourth reason why the special business tax on porcelain should be abolished. Jingdezhen has been captured by bandits three times since 1930, and its vitality has been greatly damaged. After several years, it has not yet recovered. Industry and commerce are in extreme difficulties. Local gentry and merchants are seeking relief every day. However, the rise and fall of the market depend on the porcelain industry, and the development of the porcelain industry must first abolish donations and taxes and then gradually prosper. This is the fifth reason why the special business tax on porcelain should be abolished. Currently, the economic bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of industry and commerce have become a common situation in our country. National products, porcelain in particular, are in a very dangerous situation. The wise authorities already have relief measures for national silk and tea, and they should especially maintain national porcelain to strengthen the country. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has resolutely decided to rehabilitate the countryside, with the abolition of exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes as a prerequisite, and has ordered the Rural Rehabilitation Committee to investigate all people's groups in the country. The porcelain merchants and others are fortunate to have survived. It is reasonable to submit the above details in writing to your Yuan (Ministry) for review and approval to abolish them, so as to alleviate the people's difficulties and consolidate the foundation of the country. We are overwhelmed with anxiety and await your orders."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Huang Shaoxiong Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Denies Being Sent to Xinjiang <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Interior Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at about 7:00 AM on the night express train from Beijing. A Far East News reporter visited his residence on Xihans Road to ask about the central government's sending him to Xinjiang and the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy. According to the discussion, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Denies Going to Xinjiang: Mr. Huang first denied to the reporter the rumor that the central government would send him to Xinjiang, saying that this was just a rumor and should not be believed. How can the chaos in Xinjiang Province be calmed down simply by sending someone there? The central government has not yet received an official report on the so-called "independence" movement of the Xinjiang Hui people. Reports say that the so-called "independent" government has disintegrated because the president, premier, and others have been forced to flee by the Donggan army. This is just their internal power struggle and is not something to be optimistic about. At this point, the reporter asked whether the central government would send Li Du, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army. Mr. Huang replied that the rumors that the central government would send himself or General Li, or himself and General Li together, were all speculation. However, the central government will indeed establish a Xinjiang Construction Planning Committee, with himself as one of the members of the committee.</p>
<p>Inner Mongolian Autonomy: Then, regarding the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, the central government has recently held several meetings to discuss it, and there are generally no problems. The opinions of the representatives of the various princes are only differences in wording. As for Prince Yun's resignation from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, this matter is not enough to be taken seriously by the general public.</p>
<p>Reform of the Provincial System: Finally, the reporter cited reports that the central government intends to first implement the reform of the provincial system in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, and asked Mr. Huang about it. He replied that the central government is still carefully studying the implementation steps of the reform of the provincial system, and the reports are not accurate. Mr. Huang continued that the internal affairs are being greatly tightened due to funding problems, and personnel are being cut to save money.</p>

<p>Cheng Shifan, Deputy Director of the Postal Savings Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, requested to resign due to personal reasons, and it has been approved. Wang Xianhua has been appointed to succeed him. According to Xu Yunfang, the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Bureau, Wang has gone to Beijing for instructions after being appointed and will return to Shanghai to take office soon.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Ministry of Communications Orders the Reinstatement of Opportunistic Measures Against Uncertified Crew Members <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The China Marine Engineers General Association of this city previously petitioned the Ministry of Communications for a thorough investigation because the Shanghai Maritime Administration did not take opportunistic measures against those who drove machinery without certificates and those who impersonated others. Yesterday, a Ministry of Communications instruction was received, stating, "It has been investigated that the Association previously submitted a request to the Shanghai Maritime Administration for not taking measures against those who drive machinery without certificates and those who impersonate others. The Ministry instructed and ordered the Bureau to investigate and reply. Now, according to the reply, the Ministry's Instruction No. 498 stated in brief that, 'According to the China Marine Engineers Association's petition, the Bureau did not take measures against marine engineers who do not have certificates and those who impersonate others, ordering to investigate and reply.' Upon investigation, Mao Jietang, the third engineer of the Longshan ship of the Sanbei Company, was dismissed from the Bureau and completed the registration procedures for employment. The original petition stated that he was impersonating others and should provide sufficient evidence for investigation. After replying to the Marine Engineers Association, the Bureau will review the crew list, and crew members without certificates who are not in the petition will be opportunistically eliminated, without ever making concessions. The crew members without certificates mentioned in the original petition are currently applying for certificates, such as Kikawa Kohei, the chief engineer of the Xinli ship, and have been informed by the Ministry. Sheng Yulu, the chief engineer, has obtained Chief Engineer Certificate No. 629 of Grade B. The Association's statement is a misunderstanding. Based on the previous reasons, the handling situation is hereby submitted for review and approval. In addition to the instructions, this order is hereby issued for your information. This order is issued on February 21, 1933, by Wei Jia Hua, Minister of Communications."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Residents of Dayang Bridge, Which Was Demolished by the Railway Bureau, Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration needed to demolish the small wooden bridge east of Dayang Bridge to build a fence along Jiaotong Road, which caused opposition from merchants and residents of Panjiawan in the area. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, the Railway Bureau ordered the Engineering Department to verify the situation, and the merchants and residents sent representatives to petition the Municipal Government yesterday morning. The details are recorded again as follows:</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Verification: The merchants in the area have jointly submitted a petition to the Railway Bureau, requesting that the demolition be avoided. The Railway Bureau ordered the Engineering Department to conduct a detailed survey of the traffic situation in the area yesterday and submit a report for review. If the demolition of the bridge does not cause much loss to the residents in the area, the Railway Bureau will implement it for the sake of the project.</p>
<p>Residents' Petition: Residents of Panjiawan are deeply afraid that the Railway Bureau will implement the demolition for the sake of the project. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, they sent representatives Sun Guifen, Wang Xiwu, Chen Yuxin, and others, carrying a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting that the Railway Bureau be asked to exempt the demolition of the bridge. Section Chief Huang of the Second Section received them and promised to report their intention to the Mayor and ask the Railway Bureau to find a way to preserve the bridge. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: The petition states that the Railway Bureau is not familiar with the local situation and intends to demolish the small wooden bridge on the main road, obstructing traffic and affecting the market. We respectfully request that you verify and quickly consult with the Railway Bureau to preserve it in order to maintain the people's livelihood. The merchants have been able to develop their businesses and maintain the market in Dayang Bridge because this small wooden bridge can pass through the railway to Panjiawan in the south. More than 10,000 citizens travel back and forth every day. Therefore, the Dayang Bridge and Panjiawan areas have the prosperity of commerce and industry today. The wooden bridge was noticed by the previous Director and was reserved. Now, the Railway Bureau has not carefully examined the local situation and will demolish the wooden bridge, blocking traffic. The livelihood of thousands of small industrialists and merchants will inevitably be in a desperate situation, which is related to the people's livelihood and has a huge impact. We repeatedly request preservation, but it has not been approved. The matter concerns local interests, and we have no choice but to publicly elect representatives to cry to the court. We respectfully ask you to sympathize with the people's difficulties and quickly consult with the Railway Bureau to preserve the wooden bridge or make it into a gate, so that people can freely travel back and forth to maintain local commerce, which is a great benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Postal and Remittance Talents of the Ministry of Communications for Studying in Austria, The Postal and Remittance Associations Electrically Asked the Ministry for Questions <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>and Expresses Opinions</p>
<p>It was reported that the Ministry of Communications intends to recruit trainees to study storage and remittance business directly in Austria in order to train talents in savings and remittance business. Upon hearing this news, the Postal and Remittance Associations specially sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications to inquire about the truth and express their opinions. The following is a record of the telegram: Zhu Xun, Minister of Communications of Nanjing,</p>
<p>With respect, it is reported that your Ministry intends to recruit six trainees to study in Guangdong in order to train specialized talents in postal savings and remittance business, and will first be sent by the Postal and Savings Bureaus to designated domestic bureaus for two months of study, and then to Austria, with a setting-up fee of 3,000 yuan, round-trip travel expenses of 960 pounds, and monthly living expenses of 120 pounds, etc. Upon reading it, we were shocked. Regardless of the expenses borne by the people in this method, which should not be borne by the current postal service, which is constantly experiencing financial difficulties as your Ministry has often reported, there are already several people studying in Austria among the current service personnel in the post office, and there is no shortage of other specialized savings and remittance talents. If your Ministry needs savings and remittance talents, it only needs to select them according to the postal examination system, and there is no one who is not competent. This time, another recruitment outline for trainees has been formulated, and the qualifications stipulated are mostly inconsistent with the qualifications of our existing postal personnel. Once external recruitment is conducted, all postal employees will be rejected. This method clearly violates the inherent perfect examination system of the postal service, buries the existing specialized talents of the postal service, and the result will be that your Ministry's actions will gradually lead to the destruction of the postal system and the insertion of private individuals, to the waste of public funds, and especially to other matters. In order to maintain the postal system, our association and others deeply hope that this move is still a newspaper rumor and not a fact. We hereby send a special telegram to your Ministry to inquire about the details. If this is the case, we urge you to reconsider and withdraw the order. It would be a great blessing for the postal service. Shanghai Postal Workers Union, Shanghai Postal Staff Union, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Customs Patrol Boats "Haiqing" and "Haicheng" Launched Yesterday <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Bottle Broken by the Commissioner of Customs' Wife</p>
<p>The two patrol boats, "Haiqing" and "Haicheng," built by the Jiangnan Shipyard for the Jianghai Customs, were launched one after the other yesterday morning at around 10 a.m. Mrs. Fang Jiaju, wife of the Customs Commissioner, broke the bottles. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Ceremony Platform: In front of the "Haiqing" and "Haicheng" patrol boats, a ceremony platform of about twenty feet square and ten feet high was erected for each. The platform was covered with flags of all nations. In the center was a large flower vase presented by the shipyard to Mrs. Fang, who would break the bottles. At the bow of each patrol boat, a bottle of champagne was wrapped in five-colored silk ribbons. The national flag, with a white sun on a blue sky over a red earth, was hung fore and aft of the ships.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Guests: Yesterday, those who attended the ceremony were welcomed from the Jianghai Customs pier by a small steamer specially prepared by the Jiangnan Shipyard. Those in attendance included Mr. Frand, Inspector of the Customs Patrol; Mr. Tailai, Superintendent of Works; Mr. Yuan Jin, Customs Commissioner; Mrs. Fang Jiaju, who would break the bottles; Commander Wang Shouting of the Naval Training Fleet; Mr. Wu Zhennan, Director of the Coast Guard; Commander Qiu Zizhong of the Yixian ship; Mr. Chen Zaofan, Deputy Director of the shipyard; Mr. Mao Gen, Chief Engineer; Mr. Liang Xunying, Head of the Materials Section; Mr. Yu Jianfu, Head of the Business Section; Mr. Ye Fangzhe, Head of the Statistics Section; Mr. Ye Baoqi, Battalion Commander of the Guard; and the captains of various ships stationed in Shanghai, etc.</p>
<p>Grand Launching Ceremony: At 10 a.m. sharp, the launching ceremony began. Mrs. Fang, who was to break the bottle, held a bouquet of fresh flowers in her left hand and a bottle of champagne hanging at the bow of the "Haiqing" patrol boat in her right hand. She aimed at the bow of the ship and threw the bottle with force. It hit the bow squarely, the bottle shattered, and champagne spilled everywhere. The guests attending the ceremony applauded in unison. The "Haiqing" ship was then launched into the Huangpu River, and two small boats specially dispatched by the shipyard towed the ship to the shipyard's pier to moor. At 10:30 a.m., Mrs. Fang broke the bottle for the "Haicheng" ship in the same manner, and the ceremony concluded. All the guests were invited by Directors Yu and Lin to the shipyard's restaurant for refreshments. Construction of the Two Ships: According to Mr. Yu Jianfu, head of the Business Section of the shipyard, speaking to a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency, the two ships are 136 feet long, 25 feet wide, 11 feet deep, with a draft of 8 feet, a speed of 12 nautical miles, and equipped with two 3-pounder cannons, four machine guns, two steam engines, two smoke tube boilers, one short-wave radio, and one motorboat. The interior equipment is quite complete. Several more ships will also be launched one after another soon.</p>
<p>The Taxation Department Issues an Order to Cancel the Method of Converting and Packaging Local Wine in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>An Order Was Issued Yesterday to the Unified Tax Bureau of the Three Provinces, etc.</p>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, believing that the method of converting and packaging local wine in Jiangsu Province for taxation purposes was inconsistent with the current situation, issued a special order yesterday to the Unified Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Districts and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol to immediately issue an order to cancel it and to instruct the industry to comply. The original text is as follows: After investigation, the conversion and packaging of local wine was originally intended to facilitate the sale of goods by merchants. In July, when the fixed tax on local wine was first implemented, the department approved nine locations in Jiangsu Province—Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Shangbao, Wuxi, Wujin, Taixian, Nantong, Wuxian, and Tongshan—as conversion locations, and ordered the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol to comply with the record. In the past six months, the department has observed the situation, and only in Taixian has there been a misunderstanding due to conversion. Taixing and Taixian are both places of origin of Su-style liquor, and their brewing methods and sales situations are largely the same. The production volume of Taixian is not even as great as that of Taixing, and the liquor transported from Taixing is not converted at the place of origin and has not encountered any difficulties. Now, the farmers in Taixian who produce liquor have also been approved by the bureau to send liquor for taxation using thin books, which is already a great convenience for merchants and has no need to apply the conversion method. All the aforementioned approval of the Taixian local wine conversion area should be immediately canceled to eliminate malpractices and avoid disputes. In addition to separate orders to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol, this order is also issued to the bureau, so that the Taidong Tobacco and Alcohol Branch Bureau and the Taixian Inspection Branch will comply. From the date of the order, conversion will be stopped immediately. The bureau will also jointly announce to merchants with the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol so that everyone is aware of it. The situation of compliance will be reported for verification. In addition, if there are any conversion incidents in the place of origin, it should also be investigated and reported for approval and cancellation. This order.</p>

<p>Rice Merchants' Meeting Declares That Dumping of Japanese Rice is Japanese Counter-Propaganda</p>
<p>Attempting to Disrupt the Domestic Rice Market Price and Take the Opportunity to Buy</p>
<p>The Matter Concerns the Rural Economy; Advise the Industry to Strictly Prevent It</p>
<p>The news of the dumping of Japanese rice in China has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. The rice merchant community in this city is particularly concerned because it is directly related to their business. After sending personnel to investigate in various directions, it was determined that this was Japanese counter-propaganda, attempting to disrupt the domestic rice market price. A special meeting was held yesterday to formally declare this. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Side Fabricates Rumors: The Bean and Rice Industry Association of this city, before the meeting, saw news reports of a large amount of Japanese rice being shipped to China and dumped, which caused extreme panic. Because the price of domestic rice fell sharply last year, the rural economy went bankrupt and was beyond recovery. If Japanese rice were to be dumped again, the domestic market would become even more chaotic. Therefore, they paid serious attention and sent personnel to various customs offices and foreign firms in the city to conduct investigations. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., a special meeting was convened, attended by more than 20 executive and supervisory committee members. The investigators first reported the results of their investigations, stating that this matter was entirely Japanese counter-propaganda, attempting to shake the domestic rice market. Subsequently, the entire body resolved to formally issue a statement to expose the Japanese conspiracy and to warn the industry.</p>
<p>Buying Chinese Rice: According to Mr. Zhu Zixiang, a standing committee member of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the shipping and dumping of Japanese rice in China has been verified as a Japanese "air operation." The market situation of the Japanese rice industry is such that the price of rice is, on average, more than ten yuan per picul. If it were shipped to China and dumped, our country has already implemented a new tax on rice and wheat imports, which, together with miscellaneous expenses, would total no less than eighteen yuan per stone. The purpose of the Japanese side's counter-propaganda this time is to cause the price of our domestic rice to plummet, on the one hand, causing rural bankruptcy, which would be even more irreparable, and on the other hand, taking the opportunity to buy Chinese rice and ship it to Japan to replenish their warehouses in preparation for extraordinary events. This kind of cunning tactic is not difficult to discern. Therefore, the entire industry has decided on preventive measures to avoid falling into their trap.</p>

<h3 id="e152">A Large Gambling Den Cracked Down on Haichang Road <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>All Kinds of Gambling Equipment Were Present</p>
<p>Hundreds of Gamblers</p>
<p>The Gambling Boss Was a Police Officer</p>
<p>At 0:20 a.m. yesterday morning, the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei, acting on a tip-off, learned that someone had set up a large gambling den inside the rickshaw company at No. 12 on a branch road of Haichang Road, complete with all kinds of gambling equipment such as rolling dice and pai gow. District Chief Lai, after receiving the report, immediately ordered Inspector Peng Wenwei to lead the police to the address. When they arrived at the rickshaw company, they found the iron gate tightly closed, making it impossible to enter. They had to shout outside, which was heard by the gamblers inside, and the order became extremely chaotic for a while. The gamblers scattered and fled in all directions. When the iron gate was opened, hundreds of gamblers rushed out. Because the police were too few in number, they could not stop them all. As a result, they only captured the owner, Bai Zhenggang (the rickshaw company boss), Yang Jinghua, the gambling boss who was skimming profits from the gambling (a police officer from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau), and twelve other gamblers, including Li Rushan, Bai Zhenrong, Zhao Shigen, Cao Jinji, Li Xiaosanzi, Yuan Defu, Dai Shihe, Gu Baoluan, Li Tingfang, and Xu Shaoqing. Among them was a member of the security team, who was immediately released. Several sets of gambling equipment were confiscated, such as pai gow, chips (used in place of gambling funds), as well as other paper receipts and red pills, and all were taken to the district office. Unexpectedly, after the owner, Bai Zhenggang, arrived at the district office, he dared to roar and curse loudly. After questioning by the interrogating officer, it was determined that Bai and others knew that their actions were illegal and dared to openly insult public officials, which was extremely unlawful. Therefore, it was ordered that they be sent to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>

<p>Striving for Punctuality of Arrival Times</p>
<p>The Joint Transportation Office of the Ministry of Railways sent a letter yesterday to the administrations of the two lines, saying that the punctuality of the arrival times of the Shanghai-Beiping Joint Transportation Service is of great importance to the convenience of passengers and should be strived for. This office has repeatedly sent letters stating this. However, this office has checked the reports of various chief inspectors and found that in the past two months, due to burned axles or damaged parts, stops for repairs have often caused delays. In addition to separate letters, this letter is sent again, hoping that you will investigate and instruct the locomotive and machine departments to pay special attention and to conduct detailed inspections in advance, with added precautions, so as to avoid the recurrence of the aforementioned situation and prevent complaints from passengers. I hope for your attention.</p>

<p>Xu Kaitai, from Ningbo, had been working as a treasurer at the Qutainbao Silver Shop at No. 500 Nanjing Road for many years. He was usually diligent in his duties. Later, because his younger brother, Kai Fu, embezzled more than a thousand gold coins at the Qinghua Silver Shop, Xu tried to repay the money out of brotherly affection. From then on, Xu felt financially strapped and thought of engaging in "biaojin" (speculative transactions) to make up for it, but he suffered losses repeatedly, amounting to more than ten thousand gold coins. He then embezzled 120 taels of silver from the funds under his control, worth 14,000 yuan. By the end of last year, Xu feared that the matter would be discovered and affect his guarantors, so he informed the manager, Yao Guiqing. Unexpectedly, the shop did not make things difficult for Xu and only negotiated with the guarantors. Xu had no choice but to surrender himself to the Old Gate Police Station on the 16th of the month, accompanied by a lawyer. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution for embezzlement in the course of business. The First Special Court concluded the interrogation yesterday morning, with Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, ascended to the First Criminal Tribunal and announced the judgment. The main text of the judgment was: Xu Kaitai is sentenced to four months of imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of property held in the course of business. The number of days of detention before the final judgment will be credited against the imprisonment at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment, with a three-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>All Transmissions Should Follow the English Names</p>
<p>And May Not Use Radio Call Signs to Replace Place Names</p>
<p>Yan Renxian, Director of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications, recently noticed that there were frequent errors in the place names of receiving and transmitting radio stations. In order to rectify this, he stipulated that the place names of receiving and transmitting stations should uniformly use English names to avoid confusion. Yesterday, he sent a special telegram to all radio stations in the city to comply, the original text of which is as follows: All radio stations are aware: It has been found that errors frequently occur in the place names of receiving and transmitting radio stations, and repeated inquiries not only delay the time but also miss opportunities. It is necessary to actively rectify this to emphasize the importance of business. Hereafter, when your station transmits telegrams to various places, the place names of the receiving and transmitting stations should be particularly careful to avoid errors in receiving and transmitting. All transmissions must be sent using the English names to avoid confusion. The use of radio call signs to replace place names is not allowed. The same procedure should be followed when communicating between receiving and transmitting branches and radio stations. I hope everyone will comply.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Haunted by Debt-Collecting Ghosts <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, after the children died, he performed all sorts of laughable actions to prevent the debt-collecting ghosts from reincarnating. Last year, his wife became pregnant again, and by the end of the year, her abdomen was bulging. On the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, who was very plump. Liu was extremely happy because the delivery date coincided with the day of welcoming the God of Wealth, and he treated the child as a treasure. Unexpectedly, the baby was still a short-lived ghost and died again on the eighth night. Liu was very angry and only suspected that it was a debt-collecting ghost reincarnated, so he used</p>

<p>Believing that he would no longer reincarnate next time, he wrapped the body in a reed mat and, on the morning of the ninth (i.e., the day before yesterday), ordered a shop assistant to carry it to a public burial ground near Wu Jiatin and abandon it. In the afternoon, wild dogs gathered around the reed mat, seemingly wanting to fight for the child's corpse. This was seen by residents in the area, and kind-hearted people went to pull open the reed mat. They were shocked to see the child, and they were suspicious. Coincidentally, Zhan Qikang, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor from the Qingyuchang Pharmacy on Laiyibo Street, was returning by car from a medical consultation in the east end and passed by the area. He also curiously entered the crowd and saw that the child could still be saved, so he took him home, applied massage techniques, and administered medicine. The child was able to cry and revive. Zhan cherished the child because he was a boy and</p>

<p>To breastfeed him. This miraculous event quickly caused a sensation in the neighborhood, and people flocked to see it. Liu's shop was not far away, and the news soon reached him. Liu was curious and went to Zhan's shop to see that it was indeed his own son who had died and come back to life. He was overjoyed for a moment and wanted to take him home, but Zhan refused. Liu then asked people to intercede with Zhan, willing to have the child temporarily fostered in Zhan's care, and would also prepare a plaque as a gift and publish an advertisement for seven days to thank him for saving his life. He would also replace the hired wet nurse's clothes with new ones as compensation. After the conditions were agreed upon, just as they were about to implement them, who knew that the child would die again yesterday from phlegm obstruction? So a comedy became an illusion.</p>

<p>In order to solemnly appoint motor vehicle driving examiners, the authorities of five provinces and cities—Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, Shanghai—have established the standards for the appointment of motor vehicle driving examiners in five provinces and cities, as well as temporary driver's license issuance regulations. The original text is recorded below: (1) Each province and city shall appoint motor vehicle driving examiners who have a qualification of graduating from a technical school above the secondary level, or who have worked in a transportation agency for more than three years and have rich experience in motor vehicle mechanics and driving, in order to be qualified. (2) After the examiners of each province and city take office, the competent authority shall submit the examiner's resume and seal to the Transportation Committee of the Five Provinces and Cities for filing, and distribute the seal sample to the relevant agencies in other provinces and cities for reference. If there is a change, the procedures are the same. (3) If a driver examined by an examiner of each province and city causes an accident within six months due to unskilled technology, the examiner shall be subject to appropriate punishment. If there is evidence of favoritism or other malpractices, in addition to handling in accordance with the law, the Transportation Committee shall also send a letter to the relevant agencies in the five provinces and cities, and they shall not be re-employed. (4) If the agencies in each province and city handling the issuance of licenses have not established qualified examiners, they may first issue temporary licenses with the approval of the provincial and municipal competent authorities, restricting driving in designated areas. After the Transportation Committee or the competent authority dispatches personnel to re-examine and pass within three months, a unified license will be issued. The fee charged for the aforementioned temporary license shall be the same as that for the unified license, but no additional fee shall be charged for reissuing the unified license. (5) These measures shall be resolved by the Transportation Committee of the Five Provinces and Cities, and a letter shall be sent to the National Economic Commission for forwarding to the provincial and municipal governments for promulgation and implementation.</p>

<p>Antiquities Will Be Moved to Beijing for Storage in the Future</p>
<p>The Palace Museum antiquities stored in the Catholic Church Street and Sichuan Road warehouses in Shanghai currently cost more than 12,000 yuan per month in rent and office staff expenses. The director of the museum, Ma Heng, is still in Beijing and has not come to Shanghai. The museum originally had an office at Yapei Road, Yapei Fang, in Shanghai. Recently, in view of the fact that the storage of antiquities is too far from the warehouse, making it inconvenient to handle affairs, it was specially relocated to No. 20 Yonganfang, Yongan Street, the other day. According to personnel at the office, moving back to Beiping has become a thing of the past. In the future, it is planned to find suitable houses for storage in Beijing, and at least two-thirds of the rent can be reduced.</p>

<p>Electric Essence Lamps Are Highly Economical</p>
<p>Yunnan Tycoon Invests Heavily in Joint Venture</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Dongsheng spent ten years of painstaking effort to invent a kind of electric essence, the effectiveness of which is extremely great. In addition to being used as fuel, it can also be used to manufacture fertilizer powder, alcohol, and other substances, which has aroused the extreme attention of the scientific community at home and abroad. Recently, he plans to use domestic green stone to refine electric essence, in order to lower prices. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>According to Mr. Lu, speaking to a reporter from the Dagong News Agency, electric essence has a wide range of uses. Most of what our country currently uses comes from Europe and the United States, and the annual loss is considerable. After careful research by yours truly, the green stone produced in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places in our country is indeed the best raw material for manufacturing electric essence. It is planned to raise funds to open a company within the year to engage in development and actively refine electric essence, in order to stop the leakage of money.</p>

<p>The electric essence lamps invented by Mr. Lu currently sold on the market include two types: hanging lamps and table lamps. The results of testing the light are: Type A, 25-candlepower table lamps, cost 15 "zhi" worth of electric essence and can burn for one hour. If the light is increased to 75 "zhi", it only costs one cent of silver. Every half hour, enough rice can be cooked for three people. Type B, 15-candlepower table lamps, cost 12 "zhi" and can burn for one hour. 150-candlepower hanging lamps cost only seven cents of silver per pound of electric essence and can be used for four and a half hours.</p>

<p>It is understood that after inventing electric essence, Mr. Lu continued to invent a kind of electric essence lamp that uses electric essence to ignite, and established a Huaming Electric Essence Lamp Factory to actively manufacture various lamp styles and sell them in various places. Recently, in order to expand the scope, it is planned to increase capital. It is heard that Yunnan tycoon Mr. Wu Xingzai has already subscribed to 20,000 shares, and in recent days, subscribers and investors from this port and other ports have been quite enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Dr. He Liyuan has resided in the Americas for over 20 years. He has extensive research and experience in animal husbandry, especially in raising cattle. A year ago, Dr. He brought back to China more than 20 purebred dairy cows that he had collected over the years, intending to start with improving cattle breeds and promoting milk to develop the rural economy of his motherland. He immediately gathered more than ten like-minded individuals, including Fu Ruoyu, Tang Wenti, Li Mianchen, Hu Runde, and Zhang Xiaoting, to establish Liyuan Farm on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai. In the past year, the scale has been greatly expanded, and the results are already quite impressive. In addition to breeding, the sale of milk has been well-received due to its purity and rich nourishment, and demand already exceeds supply. Last autumn, Dr. He returned to the Americas to purchase a large number of dairy cows from famous pastures in order to expand the business. These cattle arrived in Shanghai at the end of the year, and the Public Concession Health Department, in view of the excellent results of the farm, has specially granted a "A" grade raw milk sales license from this year to encourage them. It is not easy to sell "A" grade raw milk in Shanghai, which shows the purity of the farm's milk and the success of Dr. He's ambition.</p>

<p>The Minxi Overseas Relief Associations, deeply saddened by the years of banditry and disaster in their hometown, the devastation of the local area, and the unbearable suffering of the people, previously telegraphed the central government to suppress the communist bandits. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Fujian Provincial Government again. An excerpt is as follows: "To Chairman Chen and Commander-in-Chief Jiang of the Fujian Provincial Government in Fuzhou, Minxi has suffered from corrupt governance and banditry for years, the local area is devastated, the villages are in ruins, the exorbitant taxes are extremely heavy, and the people cannot survive. Furthermore, in the 20th year of the Republic, the communist bandits attacked Tinglong, invaded Hangyong, causing widespread sorrow and displacement. The suffering has deepened over the years. Although the situation in Fujian has been pacified, the banditry in Minxi is likely to intensify. The military and militia are fighting each other, causing the people extreme suffering. At this time, as the situation in Fujian gradually stabilizes, we sincerely hope that the government will issue an order for suppression. We urge you to issue a proclamation for a military campaign to quell the banditry as soon as possible, to truly restore order to the local area, and to relieve the people of Minxi from their distress. We, the Minxi compatriots at home and abroad, vow to be the government's support. We await your urgent orders with great anticipation and eagerness.

<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Zhu Xuefan began by stating that there were two main issues for today's temporary representative meeting of labor unions: (1) the organizational issue of this association. It was previously reported that the Central People's Movement Committee ordered this association to change its name to the National Salvation Federation, which caused dissatisfaction among the labor unions, who requested the central government to confirm the organization of the General Labor Union. However, there is no satisfactory solution yet. (2) The National Labor Representatives have been designated by the government in the past, or by Central Committee members acting in their place, which violates the interests of the labor community. Therefore, this association advocates that the representatives for this year should be elected by the labor community in various regions. Regarding the above two points, this association has sent representatives to petition the central government and they have now returned to Shanghai. Therefore, we plan to report on the progress and discuss future steps.</p>
<p>Petition Progress: Next, the Beijing representative Shao Xubai reported on the petition progress, stating that this association had sent representatives to petition the central government in Beijing regarding the issue of recognition and the issue of National Labor Representatives. After arriving in Beijing, they went to the Central People's Movement Committee to visit Director Wang Luyi. However, because Wang was in Shanghai visiting the sick Yu Youren, they were not able to meet him. Secretary Yang Donglin met with them instead and replied that (1) the central government has decided to accept the proposed opinion on the selection of National Labor Representatives and will appoint those with sufficient experience and sound physical condition from the labor community. However, due to time constraints, it may be difficult to follow the proposal of automatic selection by various regions. (2) Regarding the organization of the General Labor Union, it is difficult for the central government to recognize it because it is not based on law. As for the revision of the Trade Union Law, he agreed to forward it to Chairman Wang for review. They then went to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to petition. Because Minister Chen had a meeting, they were received by Section Chief Bao Huaguo of the Labor Department, who gave a similar reply. The next day, they went to the Central Party Headquarters to petition, and were received by Secretary-General Ye Chucang. After the representatives submitted the document and expressed their opinions, he replied that regarding the National Labor Representatives, he would forward it to the People's Movement Committee. Regarding the General Labor Union, the central government cannot but recognize it in fact, but it is not convenient to recognize it by law. He agreed to provide assistance within the possible scope. Later, they met with Central Organization Minister Chen Lifu. Chen expressed a good impression of the past work of the General Labor Union and instructed the future direction of the labor movement. The representatives felt that their mission had been completed, so they immediately returned to Shanghai by car. In short, the results of this trip were quite satisfactory. Although the central committee members did not formally recognize the General Labor Union due to legal restrictions, they all deeply knew that this association was a powerful Shanghai worker collective, and were also able to deeply understand its past work. Long Peiyun then reported on the points instructed by Chen Lifu, hoping that the entire Shanghai labor community would work hard on (1) awakening national consciousness, (2) strengthening spiritual organization, and (3) intensifying production construction to revive China.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: After the report, the following proposals were discussed and resolved: (1) Before the Trade Union Law is revised, should we strive again to fight for the central government on the issue of the General Labor Union? It was resolved to intensify organization and continue to strive. (2) Although the central government has recognized the selection of National Labor Representatives from the labor community, should we continue to petition for the implementation of self-selection? It was resolved that due to time constraints, we would wait for the next session to continue to strive. (3) Should various labor unions jointly issue a statement supporting Wang and Jiang's telegraphic advocacy? It was resolved to pass it.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Gambling Den Cracked Down in Huatong Warehouse <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Inside the Taikoo Company's Pudong Huatong Warehouse, before the recovery of police power, large gambling dens were openly opened every year at the end of the lunar year, gathering crowds for gambling. Since the Public Security Bureau sent police to take over, such people have slightly restrained themselves in recent years. In November of the last lunar year, Ningbo people Hu Baoquan and others secretly set up a gambling venue in the warehouse, gathering for gambling all night, which has continued to this year and is on a large scale. Zhang, the district chief of the Third District, learned of this and secretly sent Officer Liu and Police Chief Guo and others to the warehouse to search and arrest. As expected, the gambling venue was cracked down, and the banker Hu Baoquan, gamblers Ying Zongfa, Hou Xingkang, Fu Yuanhe, Shi Wenfu, Zhang Yingqing, Chen Desheng, Zheng Zhongyi, Li Xianhua, Zhou Shaohua, Su Huichao, and 10 others were arrested on the spot, along with gambling equipment and funds, and were taken to the district for interrogation. It was found that this gambling den was cracked down for the first time in decades.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Gathering for Gambling in Vacant Space <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>At No. 43 Anping Street in the city, there is a vacant house owned by a Li family, with a rather large backyard. Recently, local ruffians have used the vacant house to set up a gambling den, widely recruiting gamblers, and claiming that the local authorities have been taken care of and there is no need to worry. Therefore, many people gather to gamble and profit from commissions. The den offers various gambling games such as mahjong, poker, and pai gow. There are often dozens of people gambling inside, and accomplices are assigned to take turns watching at various key points, with extreme vigilance. At 4:00 PM yesterday, the director of the Second Division of the First District, Liu Yunfang, acting on a tip from a secret agent, personally led officers Hu Qiuqiao and Zhang Panchi, police chiefs Li Fuyi and Zhang Weichuan, and police officers, all dressed as gamblers, to capture them separately. However, the gambling den had many exits, allowing many to escape. Li Wangshi, Yan Dinghai, Zhou Yinfu, Zhang Yanhai, Zhao Zigang, Zhang Erbao, Lei Fugen, Yang Yongjin, Zhu Peifang, Wu Shaozhi, Teng Xiaoxing, Chen Jinsheng, Yu Sanyi, Yao Yongkang, Guo Yongquan, Gan Caijin, Wang San, Chen Agen, Zhou Ayu, Pan Xikun, Tao Ada, Ying Jinyuan, Bai Yinxiao, Du Tongdou, and Han Xiaolin, and 25 other male and female gamblers were arrested on the spot, and mahjong tiles, poker cards, etc., along with gambling funds, silver coins, were seized and taken to the station. After being interrogated by Director Liu, the defendants claimed that the house was a vacant yard, Li Wangshi was the second landlord and there was no banker, and they were just relaxing during the Lunar New Year. They refused to confess the truth. Director Liu determined that there must be a banker because there were so many gamblers gathered in the den. In addition to ordering a secret investigation, he sentenced Li Wangshi and others as witnesses to be sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Apprentice Actually Treats Boss as Son <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Sends Intimidating Letter with Hundred Sheets of Tin Foil</p>
<p>Walks Right Into Trap, Admits to Extortion Unreservedly</p>
<p>Ren Chuntang, a 47-year-old Ningbo native, runs the Ren Chunji Laundry shop at the intersection of Haig Road and Hongqiao Road (Chinese territory), and his business is not bad, with some savings. An apprentice, Shi Fuguan, about 20 years old, also a Ningbo native, left and did not return on the 30th day of the intercalary fifth month of the lunar calendar last year. Another apprentice, Xu Genyuan, also left with Shi on the same day. Around December of the lunar calendar last year, Xu Genyuan suddenly came to Ren Chuntang to borrow 100 yuan. Ren replied that business was slow and he did not have such a large sum of money at the moment, but only agreed to lend him 50 yuan. Xu was dissatisfied and left angrily. The next day (January 20th of this year), Ren received an intimidating letter with threatening language, roughly stating that his son (referring to Ren as son) knew that several fathers (referring to the senders) were unhappy with him and he should be careful, and that his family's children (Ren only has one son, eight years old) should be careful. Ren ignored the letter after receiving it. Unexpectedly, he received two more letters, one on February 16th and one on February 19th. The third letter contained 100 sheets of tin foil, probably meaning to bring Ren bad luck. Ren carefully examined the handwriting and knew that it was written by Shi Fuguan. He was about to report it when Shi Fuguan walked right into the trap. He suddenly came to Ren's shop to make trouble and forcibly borrow silver coins. Ren immediately called the police and had Shi arrested at the Second Division of the Sixth District. Ren Chuntang presented the three threatening letters. Shi Fuguan confessed that he wrote them. He was instructed to prepare a document and send the accused along with the threatening letters to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Boat owner Liu Guyuan, a native of Zhenhai, was transporting yellow sand from Huzhou to Shanghai. There were seven crew members on board. Yesterday morning, they were sailing at high speed when, while passing through the Luligang Puchun area west of Minhang, a strong north wind suddenly blew and the mast at the bow of the boat suddenly fell. One of the crew members, Xu Jin, (31 years old, a native of Funing) was tending to it nearby and could not avoid it. His head was crushed by the mast base, and his left temple was injured, causing a hole. He immediately fell and died, blood gushing out like a spring, lying in a pool of blood. The scene was extremely tragic. Boat owner Liu Guyuan ordered the boat to be sailed to Rihui Port and reported to the water patrol team, which sent police to temporarily detain another crew member, Zhong Wenlong. Liu Guyuan reported to the local court for an autopsy. It was stated that the deceased was recommended to work on the boat, with a monthly salary of nine yuan, and had only worked for about two months. Subsequently, Prosecutor Cao Changling questioned him and then led Examiner Xuan Zhiming to conduct an autopsy. It was found that the deceased Xu Jin was indeed crushed to death. The report stated that the boat owner Liu Guyuan should provide a coffin and burial, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The Second Public Performance of the Nameless Theater Actors Association. It is said that after the first public performance of the Nameless Theater Actors Association at the Jiuxing Grand Theater, they are now scheduled to give a second public performance on February 26th at the Lake Society at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road. Under the current economic panic and the devastation of the past January 28th incident, Shanghai's rents are expensive, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing. All citizens unanimously demand rent reduction and relief for unemployed workers. The Nameless Theater Actors Association, in view of this, and with the support of the Municipal Rent Reduction Association, has rehearsed the plays "Boss Pan," "The Three Families Living Together," "Gentleman on the Beam," "One Hundred Gold Pounds," "Brothers," "Whaling," and "Wanderer," which are related to rent reduction and unemployment, and will be performed in two sessions, day and night (the day session starts at 1:00 PM, and the night session starts at 7:00 PM). They have been rehearsing busily for days. It is also said that their scenery and lighting are all newly installed. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the article "Wusong Party and Government Organs Mediate Rent Reduction" in your newspaper's local news section on the 22nd of this month, I find that it does not fully accord with the facts. In particular, the concluding statement "The problem of rent reduction has not been resolved" is untrue. I must request a correction to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>Our company has more than a hundred houses in Wusong City, which were destroyed in the January 28th incident last year. We were unable to rebuild them. Later, due to the encouragement of various parties who were concerned about the city's appearance, our company, in accordance with the municipal government's reconstruction plan, mortgaged all the land to Yiji Bank and勉力rebuilt thirty houses first. Based on the estimated cost, the rent was set at 20 yuan and 6 cents per house, which is the lowest price and barely covers the mortgage interest and expenses. On February 8th, when the four organs convened a meeting to mediate, we presented detailed accounts. After repeated review by the attendees, it was confirmed that no further reduction was possible. The original rent price was unanimously approved and recorded. As for other items, our company has had deep emotional ties with the tenants for many years, so we have all made concessions. Thus, the rent dispute has been resolved and there are no outstanding issues. Fearing that rumors will cause misunderstandings, I hereby briefly explain the situation and request that you provide a correction to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Ren Changhe Real Estate Company, Shanghai. January 22nd.</p>

<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>According to a friend, the Reading Guidance is specifically set up for readers of the Shenbao Circulation Library, and its guidance scope is limited to the readers of the library. If this is true, I wonder if I, a poor boy stranded far away, can also be granted special consideration and guidance? First of all! I am very urgently seeking! I sincerely beseech the teacher to heal us illiterates and save us lonely and helpless youths with the spirit of teaching all without discrimination!</p>
<p>I am a Western-style clothing worker, currently working as a clerk in a Chinese-owned Western-style clothing store here in Japan. (Most of the Western-style clothing stores here are opened by Chinese.) When I was young, I read some books like "Hundred Family Surnames," "Thousand Character Classic," "Primer of Classical Allusions," and "Classic of Filial Piety" in a private school in my hometown for about three years. Later, because my family could not afford it, I had to be sent to a weaving factory in Hangzhou as an apprentice. The so-called apprentice actually learned not weaving technology, but rather换水烟袋for the accountant, sweeping the house, making tea, serving meals,倒便壼, catching臭虫, and other chores. After messing around like this for more than two years, I ended up returning to my hungry home due to a serious illness. Because of my poor health, my mother told me to learn a lighter craft. Tailoring only requires sitting and threading needles all day long, and it is 문축문하기. This was truly the most ideal and noble profession in my mother's eyes. And my destiny, my youth, was sewn into the needle holes of the clothes of those wealthy gentry and aristocratic sons. The ruler in my hand cannot measure my own bleak future. The so-called happiness, the so-called joy, has already been cut off by the scissors and彈去了 by the chalk line.</p>
<p>Teacher! Do you think what I wrote above is nonsense? No, this is enough to prove that people like me are everywhere, whether in remote rural areas or at the ends of the earth. Therefore, I hope that your work is not only targeted at shop assistants, workers, and unemployed youths in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now, please allow me to state the main purpose of my writing this letter. In the past, I was also one of those沉沦in low-level taste, reading鸳鸯蝴蝶派 novels (as mentioned in Mr. He Chang's letter in your publication on the first of this month). However, in recent years, I have changed. I feel that these are harmful to my stomach, and I want to replace them with some nutritious things to solve my hunger. Now, what I want to ask the teacher to teach me is a part of this new food that I cannot digest.</p>
<p>I have recently become very fond of reading social science books, and I pay special attention to reading the newspapers. I can say that I read every word of the international news reported in the newspapers without missing a single one. I have gradually become clear about the changes in the international political situation, as well as the organizational systems of various countries and the主張of various political parties. But what I don't understand now is the news in the economic field, such as "currency war," "currency cooperation," "dollar devaluation," "American purchase of gold," "exchange rate stabilization guarantee," "gold embargo lift," "gold export," "gold policy," and other various terms that I cannot thoroughly understand. Teacher! Are there any popular books that can explain these questions that I can purchase? Or, how can I gain basic knowledge in this area and overcome my current difficulties in understanding? Can the books listed below help me solve the previous difficulties? I would like to ask the teacher to clearly teach me these things!</p>
<p>(1) "Research on the Problem of Gold Expensive Silver Cheap," (2) "Outline of Currency," (3) "World Currency Problem," (4) "Research on the Price of Silver," (5) "Currency ABC," (6) "Discussion on the Problem of Gold Expensive Silver Cheap," (7) "The Problem of Gold," (8) "World Economic Conference," (9) "Silver Problem" (see library catalog). Teacher, regarding the questions I raised earlier, I not only do not understand them, but I simply do not understand what relationship they have with the national economy and people's livelihood? Who is manipulating its changes? I really don't understand at all. Teacher, you won't laugh at me for being too naive, right?</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to systematically study economics. Please trouble the teacher to provide me with a list of books from simple to profound. I think that with the prescription the teacher has prescribed for me, I will definitely be able to build a strong physique. I offer my most sincere enthusiasm to the teacher.</p>

<p>— Jingjuan</p>
<p>Children: What is your school motto? Does it have the four words "Loving Spirit"? Are you loving towards your teachers? Do you have a loving spirit towards your classmates?</p>
<p>Foreigners say that we Chinese are like scattered sand without a loving spirit. Therefore, when foreigners invade our territory, we cannot unite to resist. Sometimes, we even fight among ourselves. This is because we lack a loving spirit.</p>
<p>Children: You must have a loving spirit towards your fathers, mothers, elder brothers, younger brothers, elder sisters, younger sisters, teachers, and classmates. You must also have a loving spirit towards every Chinese person in society. If we unite this great loving spirit, our country will have great strength as a whole. Would foreigners still dare to bully us? Would they still dare to ridicule us as a nation like scattered sand? Would we Chinese still be afraid of not being strong?</p>
<p>Children: Everyone must have a loving spirit!</p>

<p>Lingling is already seven years old. Her mother chose a school for her and sent her to enroll. But when she heard the news of going to school, she started to cry. Although her mother repeatedly tried to persuade her, Lingling was unwilling to go to school. She said, "Studying is not as fun as playing."</p>
<p>One morning, she secretly slipped out of the school gate and met a large squirrel on the road. She said to the squirrel, "You are so happy! Eating walnuts, drinking clear water, how free you are! I want to play with you and be permanent companions." The squirrel replied, "I don't have time. I have to find food for my children. I must work. Where would I have time to play?" Lingling had to find something else to play with. She met ants again. She said, "Brother Ant! Come and play with me for a while!" The ant shook its head and said, "Where would I have space? If I don't work, how can I live?" Lingling went to find bees. She said to the bees, "You are so happy! Singing songs all day long, flying around, looking at the scenery, let's be friends and play games?" The bee said, "I'm sorry, please find another friend! I have to work to get through the winter. There is no time for playing!"</p>
<p>Lingling thought: These animals all have to work, let me go find flowers to play with. They are idle all day and have nothing to do. So she walked up to a small red flower and said to it, "Little red flower! I think you are idle all day long and don't need to work. Play with me for a while." The little red flower said, "My work is very busy. Every day I have to open my petals, absorb sunlight and air. This requires my roots to find food in the soil, and then use my branches to distribute nutrients to all parts of my body. Where would I have any time to spare?"</p>
<p>After hearing the flower's words, Lingling immediately returned to her mother and said to her, "Dear Mother! Animals and plants in the world all have work to do. Am I not as good as them? I also want to do things!" Her mother patted Lingling's shoulder and said, "Little darling! Don't you also have work to do? Going to school to study is your immediate and important work!" After hearing her mother's words, Lingling became very diligent in going to school from then on.</p>
<p>Children! The season for school to start has arrived. Are there any of you who are playing truant? Let him read this fable, and perhaps he will become a hard-working child.</p>

<p>It was very cold today. After dinner, Dad declared first that he wouldn't go out tonight. Then, Mom also declared that she wouldn't go out tonight. So we sat around the stove chatting.</p>
<p>There were four of us in total: Dad, Mom, me, and my little sister.</p>
<p>Dad kept looking at me and smiling. I thought to myself, he's going to tell a story again today.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Mom spoke first, interrupting this good thing. Mom said, "Last year was the Year of National Products, and this year is the Year of Women's National Products, and also the Year of the Child. Last year was your year, this year is my and Huier's year."</p>
<p>After Mom said that, she kept looking at Dad and smiling, and Dad was also smiling. I heard the words "Year of the Child" for the first time today. Although I didn't understand it, I was very happy because Mom said this year was mine and her year.</p>
<p>Dad said, "Your year, I'm afraid you won't get good results. Women are too vain, too concerned about looking good. It's Huier's year that will be more reliable. I believe many children will definitely welcome the arrival of this Year of the Child."</p>
<p>In this way, I was even happier.</p>
<p>Then, Mom said again, "How were your results last year in this year of yours?"</p>
<p>After hearing this, Dad didn't speak, as if he couldn't answer. Mom seemed very proud, as if she had won a victory.</p>
<p>After a long silence, I asked Mom, "What does 'Year of the Child' mean?"</p>
<p>Mom replied to me, "The meaning of the Year of the Child is that in this year, we will do more things for children, especially help children more, publish many children's books for children to read, improve children's lives more, and if we do well this year, if we have real results, then this year will be your happiest year!"</p>
<h3 id="e209">Two Animals That Save People in Winter <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Daqi</p>
<p>In the lost Northeast provinces of my country, the climate in winter is much colder than in the south. Often, people on the road cannot withstand the severe cold and collapse on the road, frozen stiff, and die from freezing. There is a kind of wild animal called a sable. If it encounters a frozen person on the road, it will gather many sables of its kind to cover the frozen person. Because the body temperature of the sable is very high, the frozen person often gets warmth and is saved. How loving and intelligent this little animal is! But there are people who catch sables who take advantage of this, pretending to be dead, lying on the road, waiting for many sables to save their lives. Then they get up, catch the sables one by one, and skin them to sell for money. Sable fur is very valuable, although they profit from it, but I think this behavior is deceptive and cruel. I really want to feel unfair for the sables, as the saying goes, "A good deed is not rewarded!"</p>
<p>There is a kind of dog in Europe that can save people who are lost in the mountains when it snows heavily, and help them safely descend the mountain, so they don't freeze to death on the mountain, and don't mistakenly walk and fall into a snow pit. This kind of dog is raised by people at the foot of the mountain. When it snows heavily, they tie a bottle of wine to the dog, and the dog runs to the mountain, delivering the wine to the lost person. The lost person drinks the wine and naturally feels warmer, able to resist the cold air, and can move. Dogs have the strongest memory. Even though snow covers the mountains and valleys, burying the paths, the dog can still distinguish the roads, leading the way in front, and the lost person follows behind, safely descending the mountain. Otherwise, in a dilemma, they would freeze to death.</p>

<p>Lian'er: No, no, please give me the cake first.</p>
<p>Hua'er: Okay, okay, you take the cake first, but don't forget about the candy.</p>
<p>Lian'er didn't get the candy back, but ate the cake. Hua'er asked him to return the cake, but instead he hit him.</p>
<p>Hua'er lost the candy and the cake, and was very angry in his heart. From then on, he knew that only himself was the most reliable in the world.</p>

<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>There is a child next door to my house. Because he was very naughty, he was playing next to a boiling pot of water one time. He was careless and his upper body fell into the pot. The boiling water scalded him half to death. Later, although he was cured by a doctor, his two hands eventually became disabled!</p>
<p>Every day when he gets up, he needs someone else to dress him; when he washes his face, he needs someone else to wash him; when he eats, he needs someone else to feed him;... He sees other children being able to write square characters, draw pictures, do handicrafts,... He can't do these things himself; he envies others on the one hand and resents himself on the other! He often thinks: "I now know the happiness of having hands." But he will forever be a disabled person!</p>

<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Humans generally show smiles when they are happy. There is an old saying that goes, "When the heart gets what it likes, the mouth always wants to laugh." Animals are the same. When animals are happy, angry, sad, or happy, although they don't have expressions like smiling and crying like higher-level humans, even if they do have expressions, our human eyes can't tell the difference. But what we often see is just the appearance of muscle tension and relaxation. For example, when they are happy, animals will definitely show their teeth, a joyful appearance. The following expressions can be shown: (1) All teeth can be seen, (2) The lips are contracted, (3) The tip of the nose is wrinkled, (4) Unconsciously emitting a slight sound, (5) Eyes are moist? (6) Light and unrestrained appearance. Such as lions, tigers, leopards and other feline beasts, are like this. If it is a bird, it will call out a slight happy sound. Generally, the calls of birds, probably high-pitched calls are singing, and low-pitched calls indicate what they want. If we are often close to birds and beasts, we can tell the difference. For example, when feeding, the birds and beasts are naturally very happy, and show a lively smile. When competing with their kind, they show a fierce angry expression. When they are afraid of being harmed by different kinds, they show a sad expression with elongated muscles and trembling.</p>

Sun Kang! He also wants to study hard, but only because he doesn't have a lamp.</p>
<p>Suddenly I saw a bright light outside the window, why not catch snow as an oil lamp. Sun Kang does it, makes it happen, piles up layers on the table, white snow piles shining brightly, reflecting the snow light to study hard. Ah! Reflecting the snow light to study hard.</p>

<h3 id="e216">The Progress of Communication Devices | From Waving to Wireless Telegraphy <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>The sound of human speech can only be heard within a few steps; when two people are far apart, they cannot hear each other. However, people cannot avoid separation, nor can they avoid communicating messages to each other. Therefore, our ancestors came up with ways to greet each other from afar very early on. Humans in the Stone Age waved to greet each other when they were separated by a river or a valley (Figure 1). Or burn a pile of fire (Figure 2) to let the people on the opposite side know that there are people here too. Later, beacon fires were invented (Figure 3). When enemies invaded, they raised bright beacon fires to warn the people in their territory to prepare quickly. We have probably all read the story of "King You of Zhou Playing with the Dukes with Beacon Fires" in history. From this story, we can know that beacon fires were the only means of communication at that time. In the eighteenth century, the French created a Venetian blind-style communication device (Figure 4). This thing was erected in high places, one every four or five miles. There were six leaves that could be opened and closed freely. Due to various different opening and closing methods, sixty-three different symbols could be expressed. This communication device was later improved by the British, becoming something like a signal machine on modern railways (Figure 5). They erected this kind of signal machine in important locations everywhere to convey military news. However, it was completely ineffective at night and in foggy weather. At the same time, in the army, soldiers used a kind of disc (Figure 6) as a signal to communicate messages. In the nineteenth century, a heliograph (Figure 7) appeared, which used the flash of light reflected from a mirror to transmit messages. In 1837, the American Morse invented the wired telegraph. His earliest telegraph machine used needles to indicate numbers (Figure 8), and was gradually improved to become what it is today (Figure 9). In 1877, the Englishman Bell invented the telephone (Figure 10). Finally, Marconi invented the wireless telegraph (Figure 11), which is the most convenient tool for modern communication.</p>

<p>In the Shanghai Basketball Association A-League Championship, the Sea Bandits and Mai Ling had two wins in three games. In last night's first final, the result was 45 to 36, with Mai Ling defeating the Sea Bandits. The second game is scheduled to be held on Tuesday night. If Mai Ling wins again, they will get the championship. Otherwise, a third final will be held.</p>
<p>The game was infinitely variable, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. The two teams went up and down several times, and the score difference was also very small, making the outcome unpredictable. It was not until the last five minutes that it was decided. When the Sea Bandits were leading by two points with a score of 33 to 31, Kai Deng suddenly made long-range shots, scoring four goals in one breath, and reversing the score to 39 to 33, surpassing the Sea Bandits. From then on, the situation was set, and the Sea Bandits suffered a crushing defeat.</p>
<p>There were many wonderful performances from both sides, all of which were very impressive. Due to the tension of the situation, the competition was extremely fierce. Both sides had tight defenses, making it difficult to attack. Mai Ling's forwards were fierce and terrifying, and Bi Xuepo's defender was a pillar. Among the Sea Bandits, Shi Guia Dong's weaving in and out of the court was the most outstanding, followed by Carlson. Pierre's injury in the first half was also one of the reasons for the Sea Bandits' defeat.</p>
<p>Pierre injured and left the court. Shi Guia scored three points with one throw, and Mole also responded with one, making it seven to seven, ten to ten, and fourteen to fourteen. Several times the score was tied, making it difficult to resolve. The Sea Bandits scored one point from a penalty, taking the lead with fifteen to fourteen. Suddenly, the Sea Bandits' general Pierre injured his foot and could not continue. The Sea Bandits were greatly affected by this. In the first half, Mai Ling surpassed them with a score of twenty to seventeen.</p>
<p>The Sea Bandits suffered a crushing defeat. In the second half, the Sea Bandits improved again, each scoring twenty-two and each scoring twenty-four. After two ties, the Sea Bandits suddenly got into gear. Carlson's throw and penalty, and the tall Rhein's attack under the basket, the Sea Bandits suddenly surpassed by as many as six points with thirty-one to twenty-five and thirty-three to twenty-seven. There were still five minutes left in the game, and everyone thought that the Sea Bandits would win again. Unexpectedly, Kai Deng suddenly became very brave at this time. When he was behind by two points with a score of thirty-three to thirty-one, he scored four wonderful long-range balls in a row, reversing the score to thirty-nine to thirty-three. From then on, the Sea Bandits could not counterattack, and Mai Ling won with forty-five to thirty-six.</p>

<p>| Seven to Three |</p>
<p>You You Does What It Wants</p>
<p>Sha Ge Er is No Match</p>
<p>The You You football team defeated Sha Ge Er by a score of seven to three in Shen Garden yesterday. This was one of the scenes in the A group competition. You You controlled the overall situation, and Sha Ge Er was always subdued and could not raise his head. The first half was three to two, and in the second half You You scored three goals in a row, and the overall situation was set. Finally, each scored one goal, making it seven to three.</p>
<h3 id="e225">First Half Three to Two <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The Russian overseas Chinese were ultimately inferior. However, at the beginning, they were still able to put up a burst of courage. Center Ke Ning scored a goal in the tenth minute after the battle. You You was caught off guard. After this setback, they greatly invigorated themselves. The entire army attacked, and five minutes later, Xi Qiaosheng successfully regained the lead, making it a tie. For a time, the momentum was greatly increased. Zhong Yongsheng followed and scored. Sun Jinshun built up his merit again. You You became a ratio of three to one. The first half was about to end, and Ke Ning desperately scored again, making it three to two.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Second Half Four to One <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The second half was still the world of You You. Sha Ge Er was under heavy pressure, with no way out. You You scored one goal after another, and the Russians were completely defeated. Zhong Yongsheng took the lead bravely, and Xi Qiaosheng refused to show weakness, and the record became five to two. Sun Tielitui skillfully shot the Russian goal, adding up to six to two.

<p>| Three to One |</p>
<p>Xu Ting's performance was exceptionally outstanding</p>
<p>Jinan definitely has a spirit of resistance</p>
<p>Since Xu Yahui left, Jinan has lost its center of gravity. In several battles, they have failed to show their strength, and the line of defense has been scattered, and the results have become increasingly downstream. Yesterday, they met the French Business team, the overlord of Group A, at the baseball field. There were hundreds of spectators, and everyone expected Jinan to be completely defeated. However, unexpectedly, the generals of Jinan held the concept of fighting hard. For ninety minutes, they fought on equal footing. Although they saw the difference by a score of three to one, it was vivid and worth watching.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Ke Lai's Head Work <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>As soon as the rain started, Jinan had the ambition to take the lead. Luo Haiguang and Fu Hexuan, two generals, peeked at the opportunity twice without success. Kao Sitan sat in the central hub and commanded calmly. Pike was temporarily transferred because of the fatigue of Mai Shanaier. The defensive robbery in the rear guard and the transportation were extremely skilled. After dozens of rounds back and forth, Xiao Huate obtained the Remidi triangle pass, and even trapped the heavy defense, breaking into the vicinity of the low line. He kicked it into the center, and Ke Mai said that the head was spiritual, and it flew diagonally into the net with a bang.</p>
<h3 id="e229">General Fu Raised Troops for Revenge <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>After Jinan lost a goal first, it aroused indignation. Chen Zhenxiang crossed the defense zone to help the forwards and advanced with drums. However, Da Huate Li was ambushing on the left, coming and going unexpectedly, robbing the ball and handing it over to Baoxiutuo from afar, for Wu Shufen to obtain, and made a fierce rush with Haiguang. Kao Sitan could not resist, and the two passes were lost. The ball entered the rear defense, Fu Hexuan arrived, and Kelao Fu and Pike, two tiger generals, lost their feet at the same time. Xuan Xiong gained power and smashed the door, but unexpectedly it was blocked by Fulusou, and Fu's shot finally hit the mark.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Baoxiutuo's Quick Shot Made a Contribution <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>After the autumn colors were evenly divided, the audience was all happily pleased, as if Jianan had the possibility of winning. So they shouted in unison and cheered for them. However, the thickness of the strength is the touchstone. From then on, the French businessmen revealed their hideous faces, restrained the three armies, and made continuous attacks on the Jianan position at a beaded price. Fortunately, Xu Heng and Gu Shangxiang were inside, and they were still able to turn danger into safety many times. However, the wise men had a thousand worries, and they were bound to make a mistake. In the 38th minute, Baoxiutuo mixed into the crowd and used his lightning-fast feet, so that Xu Ting could not save him, making it two to one.</p>

<p>Seven minutes later, the Jinan team, with all five forwards advancing, was about to create another tie. Unexpectedly, a silver whistle blew, signaling the end of the half. This caused some spectators to become emotional and engage in unwarranted abuse. Fortunately, it did not lead to any incidents. After switching sides, Jinan's resistance increased significantly. There were numerous tackles and struggles, lasting no less than forty minutes. Both sides had their moments of danger, but neither could break the deadlock. Shortly after, Kolet broke into the penalty area at the request of Fafanquet. Xu Ting's view was blocked by someone, and Kolet managed to score again with a ground shot. Soon after, the final whistle blew.</p>

<p>The Scotto Cup quarter-final between Wah Seeds and Western Gaolers was held yesterday at the Yiyuan Ground. As both teams were strong, it attracted the attention of many fans. The field was muddy after rain and snow, which slightly diminished the spectacle. Both sides played very intensely on offense and defense. The result was a 1-1 draw, and a replay will be scheduled.</p>

<p>Wah Seeds' forward line had a slight change. With Jones absent, A-Qiao was moved to the right wing, and Cleif was placed on the left, which had some impact. In the first half, the ball often hovered in Western Gaolers' territory. Western Gaolers defended strictly. A shot by Xue Po'er and A-Qiao broke the net, giving Wah Seeds a 1-0 lead in the first half. The situation remained the same in the second half. In the last ten minutes, Li Queshi committed a foul, and Ya Xu took the free kick outside the penalty area. Wah Seeds formed a long snake formation to defend. Ya Xu kicked the ball, and Jack got it and sent it into the goal, making it a 1-1 draw.</p>

<p>The City First Sports Field Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football Competition had three matches yesterday. At 1:10 PM, the Zhu Group's Bao Gong played against Xie Xing. About 45 minutes before the end of the game, Xie Xing's center-back tripped Bao Gong's right inside forward from behind. The referee immediately blew the whistle to penalize the foul. Xie Xing's players ignored the penalty and punched Bao Gong's players, leading to a brawl between some players on both sides and nearby spectators. The referee, unable to perform his duties, announced the suspension of the game. Bao Gong had won all previous matches in the group and had the most points. The outcome of this match had no bearing on the championship. Before the conflict occurred, Bao Gong was leading 2-0. It is a pity that this unfortunate incident happened. It is reported that the association will convene a committee meeting to severely punish the offending team according to the rules. The results are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e244">Jiangsu Education Director Zhou Fohai Addresses Elementary School Teachers Throughout the Province <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Implement Local Education to Achieve the Goal of National Education</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Education Department of Jiangsu Province, addressed elementary school teachers throughout the province with the title "Implement Local Education to Achieve the Goal of National Education." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear teachers, in this period of foreign aggression and at this critical juncture for the survival of the nation, only education is our method of salvation, and only elementary education is our fundamental method of salvation. Therefore, our elementary education must undergo major reforms, and our elementary school teachers should have a deep awareness. The purpose of education in our country has always been to "enrich people's lives, support the survival of society, develop the national economy, and continue the life of the nation." However, every nation has its own special environment, so every nation should have its own special education in order to promote its inherent national spirit and continue its national life. Therefore, nationalistic education is the basis of education, especially the basis of elementary education. Because elementary school children are the life cells of the nation, only healthy cells can lead to a healthy life. Implementing nationalistic elementary education means cultivating healthy national life cells and continuing the nation's eternal life. Therefore, from the perspective of the purpose of education in our country, nationalistic elementary education is the policy that we urgently need to implement. Moreover, the crisis of our nation cannot be resolved in the short term, and the struggle of the nation should be prepared for in the long term. In the long-term preparation (</p>
<p>), nationalistic elementary education should be the fundamental preparation, and the final victory or defeat of our nation depends on the success or failure of nationalistic elementary education. Looking at the Franco-Prussian War, where Prussia was able to defeat France, and the Russo-Japanese War, where Japan was able to defeat Russia, the world attributes the success to the elementary education of Prussia and Japan, which is well known to everyone. Even the Xinhai Revolution was due to the fact that the idea of anti-Manchuism had long been instilled in the minds of elementary school children. Therefore, the Wuchang Uprising was launched, and the Qing Ming rule was overthrown. There are countless examples of this. Therefore, from the perspective of the current national environment in our country, nationalistic elementary education is an urgent task. Looking back at the past elementary education in our country, it was not uncommon to take patriotism and national salvation as its purpose, and it was not uncommon to take the cultivation of patriotic ideas as its goal. But what has been the result of more than 30 years? Once national disaster strikes, how many people in the entire nation can automatically sacrifice themselves to save the country? How many of those who are able to truly awaken? On the other hand, traitors who kill their compatriots for foreign enemies and foreign slaves who act as lackeys for foreigners are everywhere. This is certainly a painful thing for us, and at the same time, it can reveal the mistakes of past education. Because past education, although it had a certain direction, neglected the importance of implementation. It only instilled empty national ideas without cultivating deep local love. Beliefs were not established and the foundation was not solid. Once tempted by foreign objects, internal shaking began, so traitors and foreign slaves were more numerous than patriotic people. As a result, past patriotic education failed. Learning from the mistakes of the past, we should seek practical corrections. Therefore, the implementation of nationalistic education must take local education as a prerequisite in order to have a solid foundation. Because the cultivation of national thought should be based on the concept of localism. Without a love of home, national thought is like an illusion. Without local education, national education loses its roots. A long journey must begin with a short step, and true love must come from personal experience. Therefore, implementing local education is a prerequisite for implementing national education.</p>
<p>The task of local education is to inspire children's knowledge of their hometowns and cultivate children's love of their hometowns. However, in order to make them cherish their hometowns, they must first make them understand their hometowns. Therefore, inspiring children's knowledge of their hometowns is also the first step in local education. There are approximately three methods of inspiration. First, children should be made aware of the history, monuments, great men, and past sages of their hometown, so that they can develop a heartfelt admiration for the past of their hometown. Second, children should be made familiar with the current geography, products, customs, habits, economy, transportation, and life of their hometown, so that they can gain a true understanding of the present of their hometown. Third, children should be made aware of the advantages and disadvantages of their hometown, so that they can have reform ideals for the future of their hometown. Once the understanding of the three is clear, the emotion of the hometown will naturally arise.</p>
<p>As for the relationship between hometown and nation, it is originally the relationship between the whole and the part, which is also a mutually dependent relationship. Once there is an understanding of the hometown, and then with considerable inspiration, it is easy to gain an understanding of the nation. Once there is a love of hometown, and then with practical guidance, it is easy to develop a love of nation. This connection of organic relationships is also the function of local education. Human love is originally from small to large and from near to far, so those who can understand their hometown must be able to understand the nation, and those who can love their hometown must be able to love the nation. Looking at the past dynasties of our country, when bandits and chaos disturbed the country, if there were a few people who sacrificed themselves to defend their hometowns, the overall situation would be maintained. Another example is when Japanese pirates invaded Jiangnan, and if there were occasional loyal and righteous people who sacrificed themselves to defend their hometowns, the nation would be spared from being invaded. It can be seen that those who can directly protect their hometowns can directly protect the nation, and those who directly love their hometowns indirectly love the nation. This is enough to prove that national thought must be based on love of hometown, and national education should be based on local education.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of local education is by no means a revival of feudal thought. Because the local education that we advocate takes nationalism as its goal, and the worldism of the Three Principles of the People is based on nationalism. Therefore, the nature of local education, in the near term, is the foundation of the nation, and in the long term, it can be said to be the starting point of worldism. The importance and urgency of local education are as described above. Therefore, in the essentials for the improvement of elementary education that this department promulgated last year, it was stipulated that local teaching materials should be implemented, and now education bureaus in various counties have been ordered to organize local teaching material compilation committees to promote its realization. Therefore, at this time of striving to implement local education, there are several urgent (</p>
<p>) hopes for you:</p>
<p>(1) Strive to implement local education with nationalism as the goal and truly understand the true meaning of national education.</p>
<p>(2) Conscientiously assist the local teaching material compilation committee of this county in conducting local investigations and contributing opinions.</p>
<p>(3) Conscientiously study the content of local teaching materials to obtain correct teaching.</p>
<p>(4) Conscientiously study the teaching methods for implementing local teaching materials.</p>
<p>(5) Strive to further study general academic theory as an aid to the implementation of local education.</p>
<p>The above are my hopes for you, and they are also your duties. It must be known that without implementing national education, elementary education is tantamount to waste, and without implementing local education, there is no way to realize nationalistic education. Therefore, the success or failure of local education is not only related to the rise and fall of elementary education, but also to the survival of the entire nation. The stakes are high, not just for the sake of formalities. The responsibilities that you bear are especially important. I hope that you will not underestimate yourself, do not be perfunctory, and work together to accomplish this major mission.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Where Are Women Going? <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>I remember that in the six or seven years after the May Fourth Movement, discussing women's issues was a very fashionable thing; but now, it is said that partly because the women's issues that have been discussed for several years have not reached a more concrete conclusion, and partly because the focus of modern social problems seems to have shifted to another place, so everyone has to put the problem aside for the time being; and in this period of shelving, women are still feeling depressed and wandering; the braver ones, like flies hitting glass windows, are stubbornly confronting the old society, and the outcome is of course hard to say; and the weaker ones can only endure the pain and let the waves of the old society engulf them.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Great War, the waves of individualism swept the women of the world, and at that time what they demanded was "freedom," but they did not think that freedom required an economic element as its foundation; therefore, this slogan did not even need reality to teach a lesson, and it was already known to be an empty cry, and the free marriage and free divorce issues that have been troubling for several years, and the comedies of other sexual relationships, were nothing more than interludes on the eve of the world's economic depression.</p>
<p>If women want to obtain the same social status as men, they can only obtain the economic status that is the foundation of everything in the same way as men. The term "professional woman" may be fashionable in modern times, but professional women who sincerely want to obtain economic status still feel the pain of hitting walls everywhere under the current social system. The conflict between career and housework has obviously become the maze of all progressive women; according to the current facts, to be a professional woman, one must give up the right to form a family; otherwise, one can only be a dim housewife for life.</p>
<p>However, progressive women are absolutely unwilling to let housework determine their lives; therefore: to obtain economic independence; to have a career, one has to give up the right to have a family, and has to live a lonely and bitter life, and even a kind of mental abnormality occurs: all families are treated with malice.</p>
<p>Modern women are being burned in the sparks of this conflict.</p>
<p>In fact, the existence of this conflict is not objective, nor is there no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, the British sexual psychologist Havelock Ellis said it very clearly in an article titled "The Future of the Family," and one section is worth quoting:</p>
<p>"::: Women should appropriately allocate their time and energy to both family and society, so that both aspects can have a development that was previously unattainable. In the Soviet Union, women's social equality has been fully realized according to XX's original intention || XX said: "Every housekeeper should know a little about politics." Many women in the Soviet Union have a high social status on the one hand, and are housewives on the other; the state stipulates that they (referring to all women || author's note) are given two months of leave before and after production, and there are nurseries and educational gardens to share their maternal responsibilities, and their salaries are still paid during the breastfeeding period. From this, it can be seen that the incompatibility of motherhood and social career in other countries is not necessarily impossible, it is just that stubborn habits and blind prejudices are at work."</p>
<p>Here, Havelock Ellis clearly points out, and cites iron facts to prove: women's careers and families are not objectively conflicting, and the main factor that creates this conflict is "stubborn habits and blind prejudices."</p>
<p>But these "stubborn habits and blind prejudices" cannot be underestimated, they represent the entire feudal and unreasonable social system.</p>
<p>For themselves, for mankind (women are the mothers of mankind, this cannot be denied, right?), the only place for women to go in the future is to unite with all those who are dissatisfied with the current social system, and all those who are being squeezed by the current social system, to strive for a more reasonable social system. 2, 1, 33.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Women's Vocational Skills <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Guizhong</p>
<p>Naturally, no one can deny that if the entire society is in a state of chaos, then women's issues will never be properly resolved alone. However, we cannot stop talking about women's liberation due to the inferiority of social phenomena. On the one hand, we must naturally connect women's movements with social issues. On the other hand, we should try to solve some individual women's issues anytime and anywhere. These two things are mutually supportive.</p>
<p>So, what is the most noteworthy issue in our current women's movement in China? The so-called "women's suffrage" and "inheritance rights" are very high-level demands, and most women still have to sigh.</p>
<p>I think: If we need to further liberate the majority of women, then "women's occupations" is an important issue at present:</p>
<p>The phenomenon of women depending on others because they lack considerable vocational skills, or selling their bodies, is becoming more and more serious every day || If this continues, will women's social status not fall further into the dark abyss? How much attention should every person who cares about women's issues pay to remedy this heartbreaking phenomenon!</p>
<p>Although the "unemployment" panic is a widespread social phenomenon at present, it is even more serious for women. This is because women themselves lack vocational skills. For example, many female employees who work in institutions are called "vases" because they are not capable enough. And the so-called "vases" sell their looks and smiles to their superiors because they are afraid of being incompetent, which is also a very common thing. In order to remedy this unemployment panic that is even more serious for women, we can only start from enriching women's vocational skills!</p>
<p>I think that in the future, every educated woman should plan her own family's economic strength, and be able to receive what kind of education within this scope, and prepare for a skill of her own. As long as she can be competent in a job, it does not necessarily mean that she must go to university. We have seen many college students without skills eventually fall.</p>
<p>As for the vocational skills of female workers and peasants, enthusiastic women's activists need to run more reading classes or schools for workers and peasants to improve their cultural level, and at the same time teach them various crafts, bookkeeping and other skills, which can also be remedied in case of emergency!</p>
<h3 id="e254">Progress in the Indian Women's Community <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Wenyin</p>
<p>India is a country of religious fervor. Traditionally, various religions have given women a rather respected position, both in the family and in society. According to their legends, the original text of a certain scripture in Indian religions was written down by women. Even today, Indians continue to worship Saraswati as the goddess of learning. However, it was only in the last twenty years that Indian women became aware of themselves and began to take an interest in their social status.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this century, India produced many famous noble ladies. They began to form organized group movements around fifteen years ago. The earliest women's group was the Indian Women's Association, founded in 1917, led by Dr. Annie Besant. Now the association has a total of seventy-two branches, and its members are all over India. The end of this organized women's movement enabled women in the Indian Union to obtain civil rights and suffrage.</p>
<p>The All-India Women's Conference, founded in 1926, is one of the most powerful groups in the Indian women's community recently. It has more than 180 electoral districts in various states. The conference includes representatives of various classes, races, and religions. Domestic science research associations, women's vocational schools, and female teacher training institutes in various places are all affiliated undertakings organized by this group. In addition, there is also the Women's National Conference, whose headquarters are located in Bombay (Baviye). There is also the University Women's League, which is organized by women's student associations who have graduated from various universities, and has a deep interest in understanding social life and international situations. In various places, there are also many local women's associations. The women's groups mentioned above have made considerable efforts and achievements in social undertakings such as education, health care, and relief. Some groups also devote themselves to eliminating linguistic segregation in various places, and promoting or rewarding their country's unique arts and various crafts.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a female member in the state council of Travancore State in India, who also serves as the state's health director. A female member also served as the acting chairman of MacDonald's Legislative Council. They strongly advocate for the promotion of women's education, the establishment and promotion of medical relief organizations for women and children, the eradication of various bad habits of women, and the prohibition of early marriage, and hope for their implementation. There are also many knowledgeable women who are engaged in the administrative organs and educational institutions of various cities.</p>
<p>Many educated and talented women bravely participate in the national movement that is sweeping India, and fight for the liberation of their motherland and the liberation of the Indian nation. For example, Mrs. Salojini Naidu was imprisoned twice, and Mrs. Consins, the former secretary of the Indian Women's Association, was also imprisoned for opposing the emergency disciplinary regulations and has not yet been released. Kamala Devi, the first secretary of the same association, was also imprisoned twice for participating in political activities. Over the past ten years, Indian women have been solving their own problems from self-consciousness, and now they have gone a step further, rising up to fight imperialism politically in order to liberate their motherland and liberate the Indian nation. This progress is indeed a good example and is worthy of our learning from.</p>

<p>2. First Menstruation</p>
<p>The first menstruation of a woman usually occurs between the ages of thirteen and eighteen; due to the relationship between climate and race, there are differences in the time of occurrence.</p>
<p>The symptoms at the beginning of the first menstruation vary due to physical constitution. Some come suddenly without being aware of it, while others feel heaviness in the lower abdomen and waist for several months, and the breasts are particularly sensitive before menstruation comes.</p>
<p>A careless mother does not notice the physiological changes in her daughter, letting her be surprised and sad, and unknowingly developing a dim impression of sexual knowledge.</p>
<p>When a girl has her first menstruation, the mother should not make her do excessive labor. On this day, it is the birth festival of her new life, and a celebration ceremony can be held for her to show a happy memory.</p>
<p>Regarding teaching how to deal with menstruation, the mother should explain in detail. If there is no correct method in practice, she can give her books on how to deal with menstruation, which is also a good method.</p>
<p>The proper procedure for dealing with menstruation: First, use more cotton wool, so that the menstruation will not soak through or stain clothes, and will not cause nervous fatigue. The method of using cotton wool is to cut it into appropriate sizes, fold it into several layers, and replace it or add new cotton wool as soon as it is stained with menstruation. The ideal time to exchange each time is two hours. At this time, it is necessary to pay attention to cleanliness, and neither unclean grass paper nor long-term non-replacement should be used.</p>
<p>There are also various types of menstrual belts, and there are advantages and disadvantages in terms of application. For example, rubber ones do not soak through, but they are not very washable, and cotton ones are prone to leakage, but the latter is more economical than the former.</p>
<p>Avoid strenuous exercise and overwork during menstruation.</p>
<p>It is not advisable to take a bath during menstruation, especially not to wash with dirty water, lest bacteria enter the vagina and cause accidental danger.</p>
<p>During menstruation, especially for girls with first menstruation, it is very easy to be moved by everything, and the spirit is also particularly easy to be excited, and the expression of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness is also particularly obvious, so at that time, the mother must pay attention to keeping her spirit calm.</p>

<p>Mr. Reporter</p>
<p>"Women's Garden" has opened up a place for us women to freely express our opinions, which is very meaningful, because although it is now the so-called Republic of China, women also have a very small number of roles in politics and society, but in terms of quantity and quality, they are in a very unimportant position, and it cannot be said that women's issues have been resolved in any way. So, what way should we take to solve the current women's issues in China? I think the first is the education issue, the second is the economic issue, and the third is the political issue. Because if the education issue is fully resolved, we will have the skills to live, and if we have the skills to live, the economic issue can naturally be resolved; if the economic issue is resolved, we can live independently, and then participate in political movements, and naturally there is nothing to fear. Following this path, we will probably not lose sight of the grand goals, or lose sight of empty talk. What do you think, sir? It is fortunate to have your teachings, not just for one person. Zhu Ruhong</p>
<p>February 21</p>
<p>I have carefully read your letter. You can propose a way to solve women's issues when the world is drunk and dreaming, which can be called an extraordinary statement. Although women's issues are complicated, the main points are no more than the three points you mentioned. However, there is room for discussion on the order of priority of the three points you mentioned. From the understanding of common sense, naturally, the education issue must be resolved first. National scholars and doctors have said a lot about it in the past two or three decades. However, it is important to know that the foundation of education lies in economics, and its reliance on progress and maintenance without being corrupt, or development and glorification, lies in politics and economics. Therefore, if political and economic issues are not fundamentally and generally resolved, and it is said that the education issue for women can be fully resolved, who will believe it if it is not an idiot?" Then, your opinion that "the education issue" is the first step in solving women's issues is not a discussion of the root cause. As for the economic and political issues, in basic terms, economics comes first, but if you want to fundamentally solve economic issues, it is absolutely impossible without making a clear move in politics. This is increasingly believed by recent events. Therefore, we now use political transformation as a sharp tool to solve economic problems, and economic transformation as the purpose of completing political transformation. Women's issues cannot be separated from the entire social issues, and general social issues cannot be resolved, just as women's issues cannot be resolved, and general society cannot be said to be resolved. Generally speaking, it has to be like this. A hasty answer, not all, what is your opinion? What about the opinions of the general public? (Reporter)</p>
<h3 id="e258">Ellen Key and Alexandra Kollontai (Continued) <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Purple</p>
<p>Fei Pei: What was Ellen Key's view on love?</p>
<p>Purple Prose: She advocated for love based on the unity of spirit and flesh, and the whole personality. In other words, it is the mutual love and harmony of two people, male and female, who stand on the same parallel line in terms of body, knowledge, and morality. The two are one, and this kind of union can live forever in the furnace of love.</p>
<p>Ying Ying: I think this is completely ideal, no wonder she had to remain single her whole life.</p>
<p>Purple Prose: Ellen Key advocated that marriage does not need formality. She said that between two sexes, if there is pure and sincere love, there is naturally noble morality, and there is no need to borrow laws to protect it. At the same time, she also advocated unconditional divorce. She said that love is not permanent. When there is absolutely no love between the two sexes, everyone should break up to avoid superficial harmony and mutual pain.</p>
<p>Ying Ying: This can only be regarded as an ideal, and we hope that this ideal can be realized. But the facts do not make us so optimistic, especially in the current Chinese society, in a male-centered society, although marriage does not need to have any grand ceremonies, it is best to go through legal procedures to avoid irresponsible people, who change their minds in the morning and evening, and take love as a game.</p>
<p>Fei Pei: What about Ellen Key's theory of motherhood?</p>
<p>Purple Prose: She advocated that men and women should have different duties and fulfill their respective responsibilities. The core of a woman's domain is to be a mother, so if a woman cannot fulfill her duties as a mother, even if she can fulfill her duties in society, she cannot be said to be a "complete person."</p>
<p>Purple Prose: Next, we have to talk about Alexandra Kollontai.</p>
<p>Fei Pei: Is Alexandra Kollontai still alive?</p>
<p>Purple Prose: Yes, she is already sixty-two years old this year, but according to people who have seen her, if people did not know her age, they would think she was a young lady. Her father, General "Domontovich," was a large landowner in the old Russian era. He was very stubborn, so Madame Kollontai's life as a child was very restricted. The thought of liberalism was very popular in Russia at that time, and her father was afraid that she would be infected with this thought, so he did not allow her to go to school, but only allowed her to study hard at home. But people are often very strange. Under such rigid education, her resistance would be more obvious than ordinary people. At the age of eighteen, she participated in various social activities.</p>
<p>Ying Ying: It is said that she knows several languages. Is that right?</p>
<p>Purple Prose: Yes, her footprints have traveled all over Europe and the Americas. At first, she graduated from the University of Zurich in Germany, studying organization theory, and later she studied anthropology and sociology. She has her own unique views on labor issues, women's issues, etc. At the same time, she also has twelve points of accomplishment in literature. During the Russian Revolution in 1917, she was also one of the key figures, and was therefore arrested and imprisoned. After the success of the revolution, she was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Bolsheviks. In 1923, she was appointed as the ambassador to Norway and the commercial representative, opening a new record in the history of world diplomacy for female diplomats.</p>
<p>Fei Pei: What are her views on women's liberation?</p>
<p>Purple Prose: She divides the past and future social phenomena into three eras: (1) In primitive people, men hunted, herded, and went on expeditions, without a fixed residence. Women are in charge of raising children, and engage in farming, preparing food, and making clothes for raising children. At that time, everything was centered on women, which is the so-called "era of matriarchy." (2) After that, life became stable, men dominated production, and controlled all economic power, and women became subordinate to men. This is the so-called "patriarchal era." Women are just childbearing machines, playthings of men, and can be bought and sold with money. (3)</p>
<p>Due to the development of capitalism, craftsmen, small businessmen, and farmers have lost their original land and are engaged in mechanical work, but low wages are not enough to support their wives and slaves, so wives and daughters have to engage in production themselves. Because women's wages are lower, it is generally easier to hire them. Women who have been excluded from the production sector have returned to the same field as men. Since women have the same economic field as men, they naturally advocate equal rights. This is the real "era of equality between men and women." Kollontai once said, "The so-called legal wives who are supported by men, do not engage in production, and entrust their children to servants for raising, and spend their days in consumption and enjoyment, can only be regarded as prostitutes."</p>

<p>The Price of Silver Rose Only Slightly, Not Even Reaching Three Dollars and Three Cents</p>
<p>Although the gold market rebounded yesterday, the market situation was uncertain for half a day, and people's hearts were not unified. The trend was uncertain, and the fluctuations in the market were quite narrow. In the early morning, the overseas silver market rose in both England and the United States, but the forward silver price on the Gold Exchange only rose by two or three tenths of a cent, which was much lower than the opening price. The exchange rate fell instead. The price of raw gold in London rose by four and a half pence, and American cotton rose slightly, while American wheat shrank slightly, so people's hearts showed a reaction, and the form rebounded. The gross opening price rose immediately. After the opening, the domestic market was also tight because the appetite of the banks was still good. It once broke through the forty-dollar mark. Then, the banks took advantage of the responsibility to sell. Reuters reported that the US president had signed a rural bond of $40,000,000 to help farmers recover their harvests. The form went downstream. Finally, the exchange rate was uncertain, and the price of gold also fluctuated indefinitely. The potential was weak. The March period was still stable. The price of pure gold was 951 yuan. The market situation for half a day today is recorded below.</p>

<p>Transactions in the market were flat. In summary, Wanxing Fuyu Fuchang Hengchang Yongfu Anyida Dayong Dachang Xiangyifeng Yongchunyuan Yongda Xing Yongchang Shengyong Ruikang Shenkang Xie Xingyong Qianchang Xiangfutai Heng and other companies were on the buying side, while Hengxing Yuanchun Yongde Dafayong Zhifeng Yongxiang Heheng Xingyuanshun Maoyuanheng and other companies were on the selling side.

<p>The March period was traded on the market, and there were many buyers. Dadecheng Hengxing Shenkang and others all wanted to pay the notes, but there was no formal price. It was delayed for a long time before Zhengchang sold it to Dadecheng Hengyu and others for 700 yuan. The morning opening price was the same. After entering, Zhengchang Runchang Yuhengchang Yong sold, and Hengyu also came to sell, gradually falling. Later, Hengyu sold 8 yuan and a half.

<h3 id="e264">The Securities and Bond Markets are Enveloped by Rumors <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Disarmament and the Customs of '19 Fell by More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>Full-Day Trading Resumes on the 27th</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange still only traded for one month in March. The market announced that the futures trading for April will be allowed to start trading on the market from the 27th, and the four-session trading for the whole day will be resumed. Yesterday's trading was still not lonely, but the market price has not yet recovered. There are rumors in the market that the United States' increase in the price of silver will affect my country's tariffs, which is inevitably a nervous reaction and too early to say. Some believe that the situation is still not appropriate, the Sun rebellion is getting worse, and the bandit rebellion is getting more and more serious, which is still a superficial view. There are also rumors of organizing short-selling companies, which is not in line with English. Only by organizing a company can there be common interests, which is not possible for the general public. People are selfish, or they wait for the price to sell, or they take the opportunity to sell, fearing to fall behind, how can they unite? Therefore, such rumors are self-defeating. In fact, the initial rise in the market price was slightly sold by the initial slight strength, and then it caused the speculators to short sell. It was expected that the market price would fall by about one yuan. At this time, when the silver root is loose and the floating capital is abundant, the financial community will not sell goods for money unless there is a special reason. Therefore, the future will not suddenly lead to a sharp fall. Yesterday morning, when the market opened, No. 16 and No. 38 were quite sold, and long positions also came out. Retail short selling in the market also gradually surged, and the market price suddenly fell by one or two cents to half a yuan. The second session caused retail long positions to seek to get rid of, disarmament suddenly fell by seven cents, and the rest also continued to fall by three or four cents. However, the salt tax gradually rose due to the gradual rise of the eating households, and the short gold of the whole six also turned good by one cent. Once the wind returned, the overall situation was set. As a result, only the Customs of '19 fell by one yuan and one cent, and the disarmament fell by one yuan and five cents the most. The rest mostly fell by two or three cents to six or seven cents. The total number of transactions was 7.207 million yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods and 7.205 million yuan in futures. The comparison table of its high and low results is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

Packaging stocks are quite weak, and at the same time, mining stocks are sluggish, and the report this week is not as impressive as it has been recently. Speculators are trending to sell, and bond prices are continuing to weaken as long positions are settled. The market situation has a hovering trend. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 2.29 million shares. (Wheat) The market situation was sluggish and the situation was chaotic. (Cotton) The situation of reducing planting is the main element to maintain the market situation. Many planting plans have been completed, and the factory's imports have been reduced by 259,000 packages. The spot goods are clear and firm. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>

<p>The February period has been stopped from auction | Only Trading in March, April and May Yarn market was flat in the morning, and tended to fall in the afternoon. The situation turned weak again. Although the Shenxin Factory received a large number of goods on the previous day, according to market rumors, Yong'an Factory delivered 2,800 pieces of Jincheng yarn, and 2,000 bags of 20-count Fugui yarn. About 3,000 to 4,000 bags of new yarn have been delivered to the warehouse this time, so people's hearts are slightly soft, and the sellers take the opportunity to move, and the market price tends to fall. However, the price of cotton is relatively high, and the yarn market may be difficult to fall sharply.</p>
<p>People's Bidding Falls People's Bidding Market Market atmosphere was still good in the morning, rising by three or four cents. When bidding to the second or third session, I heard that 2,800 pieces of Jincheng yarn were delivered, and people's hearts were empty again. The market turned weak and fell back. In the afternoon, I heard that the transaction of spot yarn was not smooth, and the selling wind rose again. Each month fell by one yuan and four cents. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 16,500 bags. It was found that Jifeng sold 400 bags, Senkang 1,250 bags, Dachang 750 bags, Renfeng 250 bags, and Xiesheng 250 bags. Dachang bought 1,000 bags, Dachangcheng 1,250 bags, Renfeng 700 bags, Taixing 1,000 bags, and Fuda 600 bags. The closing prices are as follows.</p>

<p>The cotton market rose and then fell, but Indian cotton tended to rise, but American cotton saw mixed gains and losses. However, sellers still hold the doctrine of selling on the rise. The market's need for spot cotton from factories is still stagnant, but the sources from various routes have not been smooth. According to some reports, there are still rising news for American cotton. On the whole, the cotton market has the possibility of stabilizing.</p>
<p>Zheng Bidding Fell by Three Cents Zheng Bidding Market opened in the morning. Due to the rise in Indian cotton, there were slightly more buyers. Each month rose by one and a half cents. When bidding to the second or third session, it turned down again. Each month fell by five cents to two cents. In the afternoon, each month fell by five cents to two cents again. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 56,600 loads.

<p>Yesterday's U.S. cotton market lacked sellers. Initially, spot traders pushed prices up, but later, weakness on Wall Street led to a decline. Ultimately, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures saw mixed gains and losses, fluctuating by one or two points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by one point, and futures rose by one or two points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by three points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to purchases by Japanese traders and speculators. As a result, Pingal rose by 1.5 rupees, Oomra rose by 3.25 rupees, and Dhollera rose by 1.25 rupees.

<p>A telegram from New York on the 23rd reports on the cotton market for the week, stating: At the beginning of the week, the cotton market's initial approval of the Pinhai Plan failed to stimulate buying. Selling was due to large-scale profit-taking by bulls and a lack of urgent needs from fellow traders. However, it later reversed course due to extremely thin shipments from the South. Currently, people are extremely uncertain, as the House Agriculture Committee is delaying a final decision on the Pinhai Plan, and the final terms are difficult to predict. However, President Roosevelt has already endorsed the plan, and there is widespread hope that it will result in the passage of some form of mandatory management. It is believed that there is some "dime cotton" in the South that will be sold if the futures price reaches 12 cents or more, but its supply will be absorbed. Fellow traders are buying on price dips, so the underlying position has improved. At the same time, the arrangement of new cotton is faster than usual.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Cheaper Pricing for Imported Wheat; Downward Trend in Forward Flour Market Spurs Widespread Selling by Mills <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, market conditions for various months were generally stable. The quoted price for imported wheat was around 1.23 to 1.8 cents lower in Chicago and 0.8 cents lower in Canada. Therefore, after the opening, the current month saw a slight softening, and forward months also felt weak. Subsequently, due to mills selling off inventory, the market turned to wait-and-see. The market was somewhat empty, and there was some covering, so while trading remained active, market sentiment was slightly stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month's market hovered throughout the day with little fluctuation. Forward months, however, fell sharply across the board, as news spread that Argentine wheat was priced even more loosely, reportedly at only $4.10 (five cents cheaper than the previous day). Shin Da Hua Feng and Xinda jointly chartered a ship, leading to a surge in market selling. Fufeng's sales were particularly robust, causing forward months to fall another cent across the board. As a result, the current month saw no change, March fell by half a cent, April and May fell by 1.5 cents, June fell by 2 cents, and July fell by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Nearby Wheat Stable, Forward Months Weak <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw nearby months stable and forward months weak in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Due to imported wheat quotes from Chicago and Canada only rebounding by about 0.8 to 1.23 cents, trading remained light after the opening. However, as the current month was the last day, requiring delivery after this point, although overall volume was low, bulls were mills with intentions to take delivery. Hua Feng was expected to take delivery of over 20 truckloads, supporting prices. June and July did not open in the morning. In the afternoon, the sentiment softened due to new imported wheat deliveries, and prices opened lower. As a result, the current month was better by two cents, April better by two cents, June down by a small two cents, and July down by a small three cents. The spot market was still good at the end, but the market was only so-so. Dong wheat opened at $3.42, and Bengbu wheat at $3.32, then at $3.30, totaling 1,000 bags, which Fuxin purchased.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Rice Prices Remain Relatively Calm <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various sources were relatively abundant, with a total of twenty to thirty groups (over three thousand people) arriving. Sales in various markets were stagnant and unresponsive. Urban and rural stores made some purchases due to the recent rain, but the volume was limited. If sellers raised their prices slightly, buyers immediately hesitated, making it difficult for the market to improve. Common, Suzhou, and South Port type japonica rice remained flat, and Do-Yang pointed rice also saw little fluctuation. As for Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other late rice varieties, merchant brokers, such as those from the North and South Ocean groups, continued to trade 1,400 to 1,500 bags, but also due to the uneasy sentiment and overall weakness of the market, there were no significant gains or losses, and prices remained unchanged, with the exception of the Yin Yuan variety, which felt slightly tighter due to a shortage of goods.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, thirty-one or thirty-two boats arrived from various routes along the river. Sales of all goods in the market were sluggish and stagnant. The market showed flat prices for high-quality white japonica, Yang-pointed, and early rice, and slightly cheaper prices for medium and lower grades, close to a few cents lower. Thin rice was also slightly softer. The prices for White Yuan, Yin Yuan, Do-pointed, and Bu-pointed remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Hunan Coarse Red Rice Falls Another 2 Cents <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, guest Xian rice continued to arrive at the docks, and there were even more en route. This was because at the end of the lunar year, inquiries came from Quanzhou, Fuzhou, Xinghua, Xiamen, and other groups in Fujian Province. The market was initially expected to improve, and many sought supplies from the producing areas to ship to Shanghai. Currently, demand from Fujian has waned, and there is no active demand from the local or Zhejiang groups, leading to nervousness among guest traders seeking to sell. The market immediately saw another decline. The stock of Hunan red coarse rice was sufficient, and owners were even more eager to sell. Prices had already fallen by about half a yuan in recent days, and yesterday saw another small 2-cent drop. A thousand bags were shipped to Fuzhou at a price of $5.48 to $5.45. Fuzhou also took 540 bags of Shashi coarse rice at a price of $5.40, also down slightly. Quanzhou took 400 bags of Hunan machine-pressed oil rice at a price of $7.32. The local street took 154 bags of Nanjing machine-pressed Xian rice at a price of $6.40. The local street, along with the Ningbo group and others, traded over a hundred bags of Jiangxi machine-pressed Yuan rice at prices ranging from $7.40 to $7.35. Overall, coarse red rice fell by a small 2 cents, while other varieties fell by a small cent or so.</p>

<p>The destination for soybean cakes is mainly South China and the interior. With convenient shipping routes to various locations in South China, buyers directly procure goods from the production areas. Therefore, the amount of cake shipped from this city to South China last year decreased by one-third. Recently, the price of cake in this city has been cheaper compared to other ports, attracting inquiries from Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and others. Yesterday, the total number of cake transactions in the overall market was around 60,000 to 70,000 pieces, to be delivered in about two weeks. The reason is that current cake factories need to deliver the futures cakes that are due. If current cakes are needed, merchants will resell their goods.</p>

<p>Orchid seeds, especially high-quality ones, are scarce and the supply is not continuous. The market is stable. Sales from various parties have been active in recent days, so quoted prices have been tightened. Several dozen boxes were offered, with prices ranging from $32-33 to $30, but those with black color still lacked buyers. It is reported that if there are goods that are completely yellow without sand or stones, the current market price can be raised to $34-35. Current sellers have already telegraphed the producing areas to urge loading.</p>

<p>The Pingshui green tea from Shaoxing and Ningbo in Zhejiang province, last year the sales volume to America was no less than 80,000 boxes. As of the end of last month, American tea merchants still had 20,000 to 30,000 boxes in hand. Previously, merchants made small profits from sales of pearl tea, needle tea, and eyebrow tea. Recently, due to the U.S. government's proposed increase in silver prices, sentiment has become unstable. Merchants are eagerly seeking to sell their holdings. The selling price of pearl tea has plummeted by $5 per hundred pounds, and other teas have also fallen by $3-4. This kind of unstable situation has had a significant impact on Chinese tea.</p>

<p>The small tack market has loosened due to news of a large batch of Eastern goods arriving in China. The market standard has been loosened. Currently, Western goods are sold for $26 per barrel for 3-penny tacks, $17.5 for 4-penny, $15.5 for 5-penny, and $13.5 for 6-penny. For factory goods, 4-penny is quoted at $16.5, 5-penny at $14.5, and 6-penny at $12.5. Actual transactions are reportedly cheaper by about 3-4 cents. Transactions are still good on Changjiang Road, but there are no confirmed orders on North Road besides inquiries. There is still a lot of business in this street, but it is fragmented. It is reported that about 500-600 barrels of Eastern goods will arrive at the beginning of next month, causing great panic in the market. It is found that the cost of Eastern goods is mostly $12-13 (stripped), which makes the Shanghai market even weaker.</p>

<h3 id="e299">What a "Lifetime Occupation"! <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Gongpu</p>
<p>One afternoon last month, a calm and composed young friend brought a letter of introduction from Mr. Pan to see me. Mr. Pan used to be an English professor at Northeastern University. After reading the letter, I learned that this young man's surname was Lu. He was a graduate of Northeastern University. Before and after the September 18th Incident, he taught at a middle school in Harbin. Later, unwilling to live the life of a subjugated people, he resolutely joined the Volunteer Army to engage in anti-Japanese work. After the defeat at Yimianpo, he came to Shanghai hoping to find some work. Who knew that after living there for several months, the money he had brought was used up, and there was no work to be found. He fully experienced the pain of unemployment. After the reporter talked with him, he asked him to write down his feelings about being unemployed for several months as a reference for introduction. The next day, he turned in his paper, titled "My Lifetime Occupation." The words were filled with courage and unyielding spirit, and the pure and frank self-description was a special feature of this article. A friend said that there were quite a few radical tones in the article. Shouldn't they be slightly deleted? Alas! I only felt that it was a very pure confession of a young man who lost his job due to resisting Japan, worthy of song and tears, lovable and respectable! If people are not understanding and make malicious guesses, then the reporter will have to stop writing from now on. The following is Mr. Lu's original text, attached behind without any changes, as a substitute for casual talk. "The economic panic, like a storm, swept the globe, followed by the wild waves of unemployment, surging like the autumn tide, countless people, fell into the icy abyss of hunger and cold. Today, it is like the end of the world.</p>
<p>The unemployment of ordinary people is either due to being laid off or being excluded. But I, who originally had a "high salary and generous benefits," gave it up "willingly."</p>
<p>It seems that I "willingly gave it up," but every person in my situation, if he has blood, he will not admit this sentence, and will resolutely protest. The fact is this: Originally, I taught at a middle school in Harbin, with a monthly salary of more than two hundred yuan, which cannot be said to be not extremely abundant. However, after the September 18th Incident, Northeastern education was completely enslaved. Although I could still receive the same "high salary and generous benefits," I was unwilling to be a prisoner of the enemy, so I "willingly gave up" my original occupation and joined the ranks of resisting the enemy. Although I endured the wind and snow, and the difficulties of life were beyond my wildest dreams, I did not feel bitter, but rather at peace. However, in the Battle of Yimianpo, with ammunition exhausted and reinforcements cut off, after several days of support, I finally had to retreat in tears. From then on, my good hometown was no longer a place for me to settle down. I had no choice but to escape to Shanghai, which was said to be the most激昻 place for national movements, after several risks. When I arrived in Shanghai, I could still see our government's slogan of "long-term resistance" and the high-sounding argument of "internal pacification must come before external resistance" in the newspapers. However, I never saw or heard of how to assist those who were resisting the enemy, or how to provide relief to those who were injured or killed because of resisting the enemy. Shanghai, the center of the national movement, was shrouded and confused by "wine, women, song, and horses." At the same time, I also became unemployed in "isolated helplessness." This is the process of my willingly giving up "high salary and generous benefits," and also the cause of my falling into the icy abyss of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>I have tried in many ways to find an occupation to make a living, and to prepare myself to realize my long-cherished aspirations. However, even if I am willing to "cheaply" sell my flesh and blood for others to exploit, no one wants me. I do not believe that a person who has received higher education is of no use to society. If higher education is useless, then why are countless universities still producing countless college students? I am willing to serve society, so why does society "abandon" me? Could it be that so-called "talent" is also "overproduced" like commodities? Then why is it that the Soviet Union's productivity exceeds that of the current capitalist countries by several times, and yet there is not a single unemployed person? These are all the feelings that have accumulated in me since I became unemployed and failed to find a job. Now, although I have lost a "high salary and generous benefits" and cannot find a job that can even make a living, I have not given up. On the contrary, I have seized a lifetime occupation, which is to serve the truth, dedicate myself to justice, strive for national liberation, and fight for the future of mankind. Facts tell us that only by overthrowing the current unreasonable society can there be a way out and light. And this kind of unreasonable society will inevitably collapse due to the "tendency of accumulation of the capitalist system." Today is the end of the capitalist world, and now we are just short of driving it into the grave. This is my occupation, my lifetime occupation."</p>

<p>— Bei'an</p>
<p>Every night, after eating my fill of boredom, dragging my tired body, stepping on the dirty streets, I squeezed into my nest. My wife always greeted me with a smile and comforted me in every way. Therefore, everything from the day suddenly disappeared. In the lonely and miserable path of life, my wife is truly my only comforter. I am very grateful to her. However, in recent days, her attitude has been a little strange. Her eyebrows are tightly locked, as if she has something important on her mind. When I chat with her, she is always strange. I finally couldn't bear it anymore and asked her:</p>
<p>"Hui! Why has your attitude changed? Do you have something important on your mind?" She jumped up, pointed her finger at my forehead, and said hatefully:</p>
<p>"You've lived to be so old, and you're still like a little child, not thinking at all. Your sister is getting married, don't you know? Although the gifts have been sent, according to the custom in the countryside, we still have to do a full moon." "What is doing a full moon?" I asked deliberately.</p>
<p>"Dumbass! You don't even understand this. After getting married, after a full month, you send things over, that's called doing a full moon." She replied sadly.</p>
<p>"What kind of things should we send?"</p>
<p>"Two fresh hams, six hundred round cakes, four bundles, and forty eggs."</p>
<p>"How much money will it cost to buy all these things?"</p>
<p>"At least ten dollars."</p>
<p>"Ten dollars!" I couldn't help but be stunned. My salary is only fourteen dollars a month. I am already worried about not having enough for food, clothing, and housing on weekdays. Where would I have extra money to do this kind of empty thing? I don't want to do things that are all about saving face and suffering. So I said to her:</p>
<p>"My sister was given away to someone else when she was young. Now that she is getting married, we can just use our own means to send some gifts. We can save on the other customs."</p>
<p>"You have a bit of a pig temper. I'm telling you something serious, and you're always like this. Don't you care about face? Aren't you afraid of people criticizing you? I'm a little embarrassed. People always think it's my idea." She said angrily.</p>
<p>"I don't have this kind of extra money. I don't care. You can do it if you have money." I also said angrily.</p>
<p>A small house that was usually harmonious was filled with worry in an instant. Outside the window, it was dark, and the north wind was howling. It seemed to be sneering at our poverty.</p>
<p>"I knew you would say that, so I didn't tell you. You don't have to worry about it. Give me this month's food expenses. I'll go back to my parents' house for a month. Use this month's food expenses to buy things for the full moon." 静</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>After a long silence, she said this to me.</p>
<p>I was a little unwilling to agree with her proposal, but I was too embarrassed to object again, lest there be a rift between the couple, so I had to reluctantly agree. Now, my wife has been back home for six days. Every night, when I return home, the house is so quiet that you could catch ghosts. Desolation and loneliness surround my heart.</p>

<p>— Translated by Zhu</p>
<p>Once, Mussolini went to a theater to watch a movie. When he arrived, the movie had already started, so he had to enter the theater unnoticed in the dark and sit in the back rows. One of the films being shown depicted a solemn event that took place in Rome during the Fascist era. Mussolini himself had participated in this event. When the Mussolini in the film appeared on the screen, the general audience, in accordance with Italian custom, stood up solemnly, but the real Mussolini remained seated. So, people in the theater began to whisper to each other, violating the custom. A national guardsman was about to step forward to interfere with the troublemaker who did not stand up, when the bold theater owner, fearing that things would escalate, ran to the gentleman who remained seated, and in an angry tone loudly told him to stand up immediately so that everyone in the theater could see him. But then he leaned over and whispered to Mussolini, "You know, everyone here doesn't want to stand up just like you, but you'd better stand up."</p>

<h3 id="e302">Sun Wukong's "Stratosphere" <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Guangdou</p>
<p>A long time ago, we heard that three Soviet aviators had ascended into the stratosphere, setting a new world record. On January 31st, Reuters suddenly reported that the personnel who had ascended into the stratosphere had unfortunately met with disaster. The telegram read: "The Soviet authorities officially announced that the balloon chamber of the stratosphere balloon that ascended yesterday (January 30th) at 5 pm had been discovered in a village called Baodi, 200 kilometers from Moscow. The three aviators were all killed inside. One face was blurred and difficult to recognize. It is said that when the balloon was descending, it was suddenly attacked by a storm. The balloon's bladder broke away from the chamber and floated away. The chamber fell suddenly. When it landed, there were two loud explosions. The instruments installed in the chamber were all blown up." According to a radio station near Kotigomir, the last telegram received from the stratosphere balloon read: "Stratosphere balloon telegraph, the balloon has entered the blizzard zone, the surface of the balloon is all ice, we are in a desperate situation, two colleagues are dying." It can be seen that this accident probably occurred in the blizzard zone. Naturally, this is a loss to the aviation community.</p>
<p>But what is the stratosphere? Is ascending into the stratosphere an easy task? What kind of spectacle does our earth present when viewed from high altitude? Can people live up there? What are they doing in such high skies? These questions were asked by my little sister after reading the news above. Now, avoiding astronomical terms, let's "read the sky"!</p>
<p>It is said that the realm of the stratosphere is 16 kilometers above the ground. Except for Mr. Sun Wukong in Chinese "fiction," who once somersaulted and actually flipped to that place, few people in the world have ever been there. On August 18, 1932, a Mr. Picard once observed the stratosphere in a large balloon, but the records he brought back were still very limited. However, the exploration made by the Soviet Osavajim Stratosphere Balloon has achieved precise observations, especially in terms of optical success, which will have a huge impact on navigation. According to the Soviet Central Meteorological Bureau's observation results of the balloon, the changes in the color layer of the sky are as follows: 8.5 kilometers is sea blue, the next kilometer is dark blue, 13 kilometers is dark purple, 19 kilometers is dark purple sea blue, 21 kilometers is black purple gray, 22 kilometers is black gray. Other reports have not been released, so let's "hold on" for now.</p>
<p>Enough idle talk, let's get back to the topic.</p>
<p>It is said that the stratosphere is a kind of high altitude mentioned above. The color of the sky varies layer by layer according to its altitude. The color of light is probably ten times darker than seen on the ground. However, the sun's rays are stronger than on the ground. The air is so thin that it is about one-tenth of what it is on the ground. If you were magically sent to such a high place, all the fluids in your body would evaporate like opening a soda bottle. The reason is simple: The inside of the soda bottle is originally sealed with high-pressure gas. When you open the bottle cap, the hissing sound is due to the sudden decrease in pressure. The human body is the same. Soda that has lost its fizz will become ordinary water, bland and tasteless. The blood in the human body is subjected to this kind of evaporation, and the various organs will stop working.</p>
<p>But it is indeed very beautiful up there, like a slightly black monochromatic painting. When viewed through a magnifying telescope, through a thick layer of fog, the mountains, rivers, forests, and huge buildings on the ground become ridiculous and toy-like models. In good weather, you can see the shape of the earth, but you cannot see the stars.</p>
<p>After listening to the above, you will know that "going to heaven" is not an easy task. Currently, there are three ways to "go to heaven": airplanes, balloons, and rockets. Rockets are still far from practical use. Airplanes also cannot ascend to a height of 16 kilometers (about 10 miles). So the most suitable tool is the balloon. It has no vibration from the engine, no magnetic interference, and can ascend high.</p>
<p>Have you seen a hydrogen balloon? At least you have played with balloons that children play with. However, what is used here is a gas-draining device used in submarines, creating a small laboratory-like hanging basket. The hanging basket is connected to the balloon body, either with a net or with straps. The air in the hanging basket must be the same as on land so that the person ascending can live. Because there must be a constant supply of fresh air, gas-draining is used. It can emit half a gallon of pure gas per minute and send 20 gallons of air to the potassium, so that the potassium absorbs the carbon dioxide produced by breathing. The hanging basket is tightly sealed. The world inside is completely isolated from the outside world, but the person sitting inside is not Robinson. He is constantly using the radio to communicate with people outside.</p>
<p>As soon as hydrogen is injected into the balloon, the head of this magic ball rises and leaps upward into the sky. There is no cloud, rain, wind, or electricity in the good world of about 50 to 76 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. But the Soviet aviators encountered danger this time in the hail zone, probably more than 100 degrees below zero.</p>
<p>Although "going to heaven" is so difficult, this difficulty is gradually being overcome by science.</p>
<p>As for "what are they doing in such high skies?" Naturally, they are not playing like we "climb high on the Double Ninth Festival," nor are they purely gambling or curious, but are researching cosmic rays, because this is still a problem that humans do not understand very well. What is the purpose of studying cosmic rays? In short: to conquer the sky. If the stratosphere air route is once opened, the world will undergo huge changes! At that time, Europe and the Americas will shrink into two neighboring families. It will only take six to eight hours, and a lover in New York can visit a girl in Paris. Despite the gloomy weather on the earth's surface like in London, we fly in the clear blue-purple sky, without the troubles of the lower world. This is what we could only obtain in myths before, and now it is inevitably being realized day by day.</p>
<p>Of course, conquering the sky at present also has the meaning of controlling the sky and gaining air supremacy. It is also a matter that cannot be ignored in military terms.</p>

<h3 id="e303">The Crisis of Chinese Silk and Its Impact <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ling</p>
<p>The silk industry is one of our major national industries. Its annual export value accounts for more than 20% of total exports, worth tens of millions of taels of silver. If it were not subjected to external blows and internal destruction, and could develop smoothly, its future would be limitless. Unfortunately, since the global economic crisis of 1929, due to competition from countries such as Japan, France, and Italy, the resistance to artificial silk, and our own subjective destruction (such as exorbitant taxes and levies, floods, and wars), China's silk industry has declined day by day, even to the point of complete bankruptcy. This situation is very evident in the steadily decreasing numbers of Chinese silk exports since 1928:</p>
<p>Year             Chinese Silk Exports (Unit: Dan)</p>
<p>1928             180,186</p>
<p>1929             189,980</p>
<p>1930             151,429</p>
<p>1931             131,186</p>
<p>1932             78,219</p>
<p>At the same time, the market price of Chinese silk has also been decreasing day by day. Since 1928, the decline in its market price has shown the following trend:</p>
<p>1928    1929    1930    1931    1932</p>
<p>December December December December December</p>
<p>High-Grade White Silk Warp (Unit: Dan) 1,847 1,726 1,518 1,451 1,036</p>
<p>(Unit: National Currency One Yuan)</p>
<p>By last year, the export of Chinese raw silk had decreased even more significantly, and its market price had fallen to around 500 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>As a result, silk factories have suspended operations, and the entire silk industry is in a state of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>China's silk industry is mainly centered in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. There were originally more than 180 silk reeling factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with over 48,000 silk reeling machines. However, last year, fewer than 20 silk factories were operating in Shanghai, and only six were operating in Wuxi. Recently, almost all of them have shut down.</p>
<p>In addition, the silk industries in Guangdong, Sichuan, Shandong, and other places have suffered from various "natural and man-made disasters" and have fallen into a state of irreversible decline.</p>
<p>The decline and even bankruptcy of the silk industry have resulted in an increase in the number of unemployed workers, leading to a social crisis. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang alone, there are recently more than 600,000 people unemployed due to the closure of silk factories.</p>
<p>Secondly, the silk weaving industry has been affected by the decline of the silk industry. Due to the dumping of Japanese silk and its silk products, the sales of Chinese silk fabrics have almost completely disappeared. Even the markets in the Nanyang Islands have recently been seized. As a result, silk weaving factories have also had to suspend operations one after another. In Shanghai, only five are currently able to barely operate!</p>
<p>Furthermore, mulberry planting and silkworm rearing are the main side occupations of our country's farmers. In recent years, due to the decline of the silk industry, countless tragedies have occurred in rural areas due to the failure of silkworm rearing. Farmers in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces have even converted mulberry fields to opium cultivation because silkworm rearing is unprofitable. Even in Jiangsu, mulberry fields are gradually decreasing. According to a survey, Jiangsu still had 251,000 mu of mulberry fields in 1930, but by 1932, it had decreased to 84,000 mu. In this way, not only is the rural economy further bankrupt, but this bankruptcy can also reversely affect our silk industry and all other industries and businesses.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the crisis of decline and bankruptcy of China's silk industry is not only related to the future of silk and all national industries, but also to the fate of our entire national economy and our entire society.</p>

<h3 id="e304">The Barbecue Master and the Porter <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Zi Ming</p>
<p>In Paris, in front of a barbecue master's shop, a porter was eating his bread while smelling the aroma emitted from the barbecued meats. In this way, he felt that the bread had a fragrance and tasted very good.</p>
<p>The barbecue master did not stop this behavior. However, when the entire loaf of bread had been swallowed, he grabbed the porter's collar and demanded payment for the fragrance.</p>
<p>The porter replied that he had not caused any damage to the barbecue master's barbecued meats, nor had he taken anything from him. He did not owe him anything. The fragrance dissipated into the air, and it obviously disappeared. No one had ever heard of anyone in Paris being asked to pay for the fragrance of barbecued goods.</p>
<p>The barbecue master objected to the porter's words, saying that he had also never heard that he should use the fragrance of his barbecued goods to feed these people. He declared that if the porter did not pay him immediately, he would confiscate the porter's staff, carrying pole, and other belongings. Hearing these words, the porter seized his staff and put himself in a defensive state.</p>
<p>Both sides argued fiercely. The curious people of Paris gathered around, and John the Madman, known for his quick wit throughout the city, happened to be there.</p>
<p>The barbecue master saw John the Madman and asked the porter:</p>
<p>"Are you willing to let John resolve our dispute and be our judge?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I am willing," the porter said.</p>
<p>Both parties told the old John the whole story of their dispute. After listening, John asked the porter to take out a small silver coin of some kind from his pouch.</p>
<p>The porter put a small silver coin worth five francs into John's hand.</p>
<p>The madman took the silver coin, and with a serious expression, placed it on his left shoulder, as if to check its weight. Then, he moved it close to the pupil of his right eye, as if to see if the pattern on it was genuine. Later, he lightly tossed it on the counter, making it sound, many times, as if he were checking whether it was made of good silver.</p>
<p>While the madman was doing all these actions, the onlookers were silent. The barbecue master was preparing to put the small silver coin into his pocket, while the porter's face showed a sad expression.</p>
<p>Finally, the old John, with the authority of a court president, held the small silver coin in his hand, tightened the hat on his head, coughed two or three times, and spoke loudly:</p>
<p>"This court now makes this judgment: The porter, although he ate bread surrounded by the aroma of barbecued goods, has now paid the barbecue master with the sound of his silver coin. In addition, this court orders everyone to return to their own homes and waives the court fees."</p>
<p>The verdict of the Parisian madman seemed so just, so admired by the generally knowledgeable, that they did not even believe that any Parisian or Roman court could have had a better judgment.</p>
<p>From this, it can be known that a little bit of cleverness and quick wit is often equal in value to rich learning or knowledge.</p>

<p>— Li</p>
<p>On a picture album, I glimpsed the Elephant Trunk Hill of my hometown for no reason. I do not know whether it was the artistic eye of the photographer, or deliberately to ridicule me, this image happened to cut off a building, a pagoda, and a cluster of picturesque maple forests? I am too familiar with this scenery, which was the holy place where I paid homage morning and evening a few years ago. The owner of this place is Mr. Qingshui. The red building in the corner facing the river is the place where Mr. Qingshui's beloved daughter, Feiying, reads and paints, and Feiying seven years ago was the person who was never separated from me day and night. After a long separation, it has been seven years now. It is said that Mr. Qingshui passed away a long time ago, and what about Feiying? It is said that she has become the mother of three children. Originally, the passage of time has made that relationship fade day by day, until this year, even a faint silhouette is no longer in my mind. I didn't expect this mischievous picture to be sent to my eyes today, which can't help but make me relive an old dream and ignite the infatuation that I have suppressed for seven years.</p>
<p>It was also on a dim night with continuous wind and snow, that I returned from the north. As soon as I stepped on the soil of my hometown, I met Feiying in a lecture by chance. Although a friend specially introduced her at the time, saying that she was a high-achieving student in a provincial high school, and could paint a clear and vigorous ink bamboo, how could this ordinary social encounter make a forgetful memory capture her beautiful figure?</p>
<p>The second time we met was in the park. This was especially due to coincidence. Probably because one of her girlfriends was my in-law. This time we had a pleasant conversation for two hours. She naturally recognized me and knew a little about my background. The topics of conversation mainly revolved around the situation of schools in Beiping and the level of academics. She seemed to pay special attention to her own English, and she repeatedly asked twice what level of English was required to enter university. I can't recall any other words after that.</p>
<p>Because her father and my uncle were old classmates, he found out about my return and soon came to visit. As soon as he met me, he pleaded with my uncle to ask me to take some time to teach his daughter English for a month or two. Because of my uncle's order, I couldn't refuse.</p>
<p>I remember that on the day we started the class, because I wanted to know her level first in order to decide on the teaching materials, I started with an exam. Unexpectedly, her level had exceeded the "Great Prophecy" standard, which surprised me. But she didn't believe it. In the end, we still decided on a prose book as a reader, and also assigned several modern novels and an English weekly as reading material. Because she already had the ability to self-study, in the process of teaching, there were only literary conversations, and no need for sentence-by-sentence explanations, which made me feel an indescribable joy.</p>
<p>We gradually had a common interest and a blending of temperaments. We moved towards love day by day.</p>
<p>I still remember that when we were facing each other, we were silent for half an hour, and we couldn't think of a suitable word to cover up our mutual understanding. As a result, both sides blushed and deliberately avoided it. We were both cautious people, and neither side dared to reveal a hint. The bud of love was suppressed, but the flame in the heart burned to the extreme because of this pressure. Our only way to vent was to express it in writing. I remember that my diary that year had an unprecedented increase in length.</p>
<p>Good things are often difficult. In the spring of the second year, I had a long journey, and her high school life had not yet ended at this time. In fact, she could not leave the province to go to college. We could only endure a temporary separation.</p>
<p>I was so cowardly that I didn't dare to accept her love, which made her suspicious, thinking that I had another beauty in my heart, and that I didn't want to abuse love. This hurt her heart; at the same time, she had even more passionate respect for me. She almost destroyed herself for me.</p>
<p>I taught in a certain place for two years. Because of the unrest in my hometown, I had no intention of returning home, but just wandered, wandered, wandered. But at first we still had a constant mailbox, and after half a year it decreased. After another year, I learned that she was engaged to a certain university student. Last year, I heard that she was the mother of three children.</p>
<p>Now, looking back, it is like a dream. We were so in tune with each other, why did I have to avoid and escape? Since I wanted to escape, why is the affection so lingering that even after six or seven years, it still cannot be completely cut off and forgotten?</p>
<p>Now I speculate on my mood at the time, probably due to the political fanaticism at the time, and I didn't dare to sacrifice my future for love! This was indeed the ambition of the general young people at that time. Naturally, this is also valuable. I have no selfish regret about this at all, but I did let her down. However, looking back at my current wandering and the hardship of life, I feel that she was lucky not to have formed a partnership with me. I cannot make her warm and full, which is the truth. Now she has three children, which is more than enough to comfort her. It is said that life is still okay, which is much better than marrying me.</p>
<p>Contradictory life! I can't love her, and I don't hesitate to return her gifts, but at the same time, I can't forget her.</p>

<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Although "September 18th" and "January 28th" have long passed, Puyi's claim to the throne, Japan's northern harassment of Chahar, Xinjiang's independence, and Britain's westward invasion all indicate that the period of national crisis has not yet passed. In this period of national crisis, all Chinese people should endure hardship and strive for self-improvement. However, the general modern men and women do not understand this principle. They eat Western food, wear foreign clothes, talk about love, play golf, go to dance halls, ice skating, and watch movies, living their extravagant and romantic lives as if there is no national crisis. Therefore, people with lofty ideals have risen up in anger, believing that the reason why China is not doing well is the inability of these modern men and women to endure hardship. If all the people in China endured hardship, wouldn't China become rich and strong? Therefore, modern people are unlucky, and everyone attacks them. Last year was the "National Goods Year," and this year is the "Women's National Goods Year." All Chinese people should strive to promote national goods, which is an indisputable principle. However, the general modern men and women have different intentions. They wear American leather shoes, British hats, French clothes, and use Oriental perfume, as if they do not know that they are Chinese. Therefore, people with lofty ideals are angry again, believing that the reason why China's industry and commerce cannot develop is the failure of these modern men and women to use national goods. If they were not like this, wouldn't China's industry and commerce have already developed to the level of Europe and the United States? Therefore, modern people are unlucky, and everyone scolds them.</p>
<p>Writers are the most sensitive and the most able to grasp the times. Since modern men and women have such great sins, and everyone is attacking and scolding them, how can clever writers not use them as the only subject for writing articles? Therefore, articles such as "Modern Girls' Lovers Should Be Shot with Machine Guns," "Modern Wives Sleep with a Dozen Dogs," "Modern Young Masters Skate on Nanjing Road," and "Modern Students Bring Golf Balls to the Lecture Hall" have appeared in batches. Therefore, whether humorous articles, satirical articles, or serious articles, none of them do not talk about modern people. Therefore, modern people are unlucky, and verbal criticism and written attacks are all concentrated on them.</p>
<p>However, modern people say: "There is nothing in the world, and mediocre people disturb themselves! Life is for pleasure, how can we care about so much!"</p>

<h3 id="e308">Darwin (II) <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Fan</p>
<p>Darwin's university life began in 1825, when he was only sixteen years old. He and his brother entered the University of Edinburgh. His brother was majoring in medicine and was about to complete his studies, while he had just started. During this time, we can also discover his talent.</p>
<p>He was not satisfied with the lectures given at the university at that time. He felt that those professors only said some very boring things, which did not make him get any impression. He once said, "The professor lectured on human anatomy in such a dry and tasteless way, just like himself, that I hated the subject." He also didn't like listening to Duncan's lecture on the properties of rhubarb, and from then on he didn't like the term medicine. But he had a completely different feeling about natural history. When he met MacGillivray, he immediately hit it off. MacGillivray gave him some clam shells, which he regarded as very precious. At the same time, he also informed MacGillivray that he was collecting marine mollusks. From this, it can also be seen that education has a very important role in inspiring students and their interests. How many geniuses like Darwin have been murdered by today's poor education system!</p>
<p>Darwin stayed at the University of Edinburgh for only two years. His family had already found out that he had no intention of becoming a doctor. His father, seeing that Darwin liked hunting, feared that he would become a lazy and do-nothing sportsman in the future, so he advised him to change his major to become a pastor. Although he considered this proposal for a while, he eventually accepted it temporarily; and he accepted the Church of England. During this transition, he had to review classical books, learn Greek, and prepare to go to Cambridge. But he was not a genius for being a pastor after all. When he left Cambridge University to join the Beagle as a naturalist, he couldn't help but smile humorously when he recalled this short period of life. He can only be a scientist.</p>
<p>During Darwin's time at Christ's College, Cambridge, although he had spent some time on mathematics and classics, he was naturally not close to mathematics, and he only perfunctorily dealt with classical theology for the sake of passing the bachelor's exam. Therefore, this period of time cannot but be said to have been completely wasted.</p>
<p>The habit of hunting did not change at this time because of the dogmas of theology. On the contrary, the boredom of lecture hall life forced the genius to wander outdoors. He also learned to ride a horse, often galloping through the fields, indulging in pleasures all day long. And he made friends with all kinds of people with different temperaments, including sports experts, frivolous youths, and young people with lofty ideals. They often took pleasure in drinking, gambling, playing musical instruments, and hunting. And during this period, in addition to recreation, the tendency of genius still appeared, but at that time, ordinary people were often unable to recognize this genius because of the above-mentioned bad impressions.</p>
<p>He was still very eager to collect, and what he was most fascinated by was collecting dung beetles.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, he once described the following interesting story:</p>
<p>"One day, I went to tear off the bark of those old trees again, and found two rare beetles. So I caught one in each hand. Unexpectedly, I later found a third new species. I was reluctant to abandon it, so I put the beetle in my right hand ( ) into my mouth. Ugh! Ugh! This thing is really weird, it actually shot out a very spicy liquid, burning my tongue, I had to spit it out quickly, and as a result, it ran away, and I don't know where the third beetle ran to.</p>
<p>He also loved to scrape off the moss on old trees in winter, or collect parasitic animals attached to the dirt on the bottom of ships, and he often obtained fresh specimens. (To be continued)</p>
