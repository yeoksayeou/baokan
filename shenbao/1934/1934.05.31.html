<h3>讀全國財政會議宣言有感</h3>
<p>— 經</p>
<p>第二次全國財政會議。已於本月二十七日閉會。閉會前。發表宣言。昭告國人。宣言中首述議决案之大要。分爲六目。曰輕賦恤農曰廢除苛捐雜稅。曰改革稅制。曰確定地方務算。曰注產建設。曰實行内外相維。其次則着眼於都市與農村之關係。主張全國軍政當局與財政金融界中人。設法利用都市游資以期救濟農村之衰落。統觀宣言全文。頗能窺見今日國民經濟危機之癓結所在。而修辭條暢。猶其餘事。然考察今茲會議所抱之目的。必如何而可見諸實行。則如該宣言之所表示。仍不外乎希望「邦人君子一心一德」而已。此其所指無非欲萬千國人一致從事於心理之改造。吾人鑒於其立言之懇摯。固不能加以吹求。惟仍覺此種忠告。當專對軍閥官僚土豪劣紳而發。在淸白之小民聞之。則將徒增苦笑耳。</p>
<p>今試言國民經濟之危機。農村衰落。實爲今日經濟危機之主因。夫人而知之矣。政府以復興農村爲宣傳，亦旣屢不一聞。顧宣傳自宣傳。而農村衰落之趨勢依然。無他救濟之道。尙未針對問題之核心耳。財會宣言中揭櫫救濟農村之方針。其最足引人注意者。卽爲鼓吹金融界利用都市游資調劑農村金融之一端。然是說也。果於事實有幾多之補助。實不能無疑。吾人試一覆按年來農村資金流向都市之原因。便知引導城市游資重返鄕村之不易。今日農村衰落之癥結。不在於天災而在於人禍。一般農民遭受種種不法之搜括。豈僅不識生趣。且亦不知死所。其慘　顯示於吾人眼　之前者。在農民本人則爲破產。在鄉村資金則爲逃亡。現狀如此。縱有胞與爲懹之金融界中人。確肯「一心一德」而從事於農村金融之調劑。恐終不免爲現實所箝制。充其量亦不過予農民以一線之安慰。至於農民眞正之痛苦。則仍不免於愛莫能助之嘆。若是之行動。得毌有類於「不揣其本而齊其未」乎。</p>
<p>吾人深覺欲求今日中國整個農村之得救。不能不先由政治着手。舉凡各地方之軍閥官僚土壕劣紳之流。必不任其恣意横行。盡情搜括。至於中央大員。尤應公正廉濼身體力行。勸人以德。御下以威。信賞必罰。明恥嚴刑。期以數年。當有成效可見。不然。若避免一問題之核心。獨斤斤於支節。希望全國人民心理之改造。以爲物質改造之張本。則竊恐河淸難俟。對象差誤。二屆財政會議之成績如何。當於實行决議後見之。政府當局其知所以致力之道矣。</p>

<h3>不尙空談專務實際　挽救軍縮末運　總委會於緊張空氣裏集會　美俄代表闡明立塲　李維諾夫建議擴大會議範圍　易名和平會以弭戰爲目的　台維斯宣稱願努力推進公約　主張軍火管理制阻止戰爭</h3>
<p>重申不干預歐政治糾紛</p>
<p>但關心遠東事意在言外</p>
<p>（日内瓦）五大洲六十四國一等外交家、中有外交總長十四人、今日下午三時四十五分在此會議、以决定全世界軍縮之命運、軍縮會議主席漢德森宣布總委員會開會稱、際此千鈞一髪之秋、議决將來應須如何行動、此其時矣云、會塲旁聽席人滿爲患、會塲空氣嚴肅惶恐、有如楚囚之待决、新聞記者席如是擁擠、得未曾有、各國特派記者執筆在握、凖備爲軍縮之實際企圖撰述末叚文章、免再爲空談之資料、</p>
<p>今日全晨各旅邸各咖啡館信國聯休憇室、但見各國外交家三五成羣、凖備最後之努力、以决定解散軍縮會議抑仍繼續前此勞而無功之談判、</p>
<h3>漢德森致開幕詞</h3>
<p>漢德森致開幕辭稱、開會以來、時局每况愈　　下、許多國家、雖一再努力以期有成、然而各國下府錯綜談判失敗如故、漢德森因籲請急速解决下述三問題、卽（一）陸地軍備、（二）空軍公約、（三）國際理軍火之製造及運銷、陸地軍備恊定急不容緩、國家安全於此是頼、况此問題爲全部軍縮問題之關鍵、締結空軍公約、所以預防戰時對一般無辜良民施暴之唯一步驟、其應卽解决自不待言、至於國際封鎖軍火問題、漢德森卽援引大厦谷戰事以證其迫切、</p>
<h3>李維諾夫之建議</h3>
<p>蘇俄外交委員長李維諾夫旋繼之而作一鳴　　驚人之舉、李維諾夫建議將軍縮會議改和平會議、常時集會、以期討論銷弭戰爭之各種重要問題、軍縮當然亦可應行討論之問題、蓋以如此則會議之範圍可以擴大、得循各種和解途徑以期收實效也、</p>
<h3>美代表聲明態度</h3>
<p>資由美專使台維斯發表强有力之主張、挽　　救軍縮會議崩潰、彼稱美国願意裁减海軍噸數、以期預防一九三五年海軍軍縮會議前之造艦競爭、台維斯稱、「吾人願與關係各國從事於噸數之實質的比例的裁减」云、美專使更預告在最近期内德國有重返國聯之可能、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會之總委員會、易言之、卽全體大會、在長期休會之後、今日午後三時四十分始於悲觀空氣中重行集會、到會之代表、内有十四國之外交當局、在開會以前若干大國顯然不以爲此次會議有何建設氣象、主席漢德森致詞、其言頗長、請各代表勿犧牲兩年餘之工作、並切言世界各國贊助軍縮者集合的担保之必要云、美代表台維斯約述美政府之態度與政策、謂美國凖備在謀取一般軍縮公約之努力中、以種種可實施之方法從事合作、美國凖備談判普遍的互不侵略之公約、並聯合他國商榷因美國所參加的任何條約而起之國際問題、美國不願與聞歐洲任何政治談判與解决、亦不願担負任何義務、而用其兵力以謀任何爭端之解决、換言之、美國之政策爲避免戰爭、但願以各種可能方法襄助打銷及阻止戰爭、台氏又謂美國願以國際恊定成立有效的制度、管理軍火之製造與貿易、並曰、吾人其回至去年六月八日各國接受英國所提出草案認爲將來公約之基礎時所有談判中之最後階叚、蓋在此階叚實有成立總恊定之希望也、德國想必願有軍縮公約、如其然也、謂德國不願根據前已同意之基礎重開談判、則余不敢輕信也云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>主席宣言法表贊同</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會主席漢　　德森力主總委員會應繼　　續努力以告成公約、今法外長巴爾都亦熱切贊助會議之繼續進行、漢德森今日午後在主幹部集議時提議明日午後一時三十分總委員會召集時各委員所發之演說、應由無線電廣播、卽經會衆贊成、大約最先演說者、爲軍縮會美代表台維斯氏與蘇俄代表李維諾夫氏、聞李氏已將實行提出互助的恊定具體方案之謀作罷、僅擬在其演說中涉及之、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>改稱安全粉飾失敗</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外傳軍縮會議　　將改稱安全會議、以粉　　飾軍縮失敗之跡象、每日電聞報評稱、此項計畫不過爲若干國家圖謀恊力反對日德而發、英國固不能贊同、美國恐亦將保持其超然地位而不受任何束縳、不僅此也、軍縮之最後形式、恐將因此完全消滅、而軍備竸爭將不知伊於胡底、職是之故、英如參加此頂會議、將有百弊而無一利、更觀墨索里尼最近之演說、可知其昔日熱忱擁護軍縮會議者、今亦承認良機已逝、無可挽回矣、</p>
<p>（二十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>軍縮精神名存實亡</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今日有六十四　　國代表、中有各國外長　　十四人、及美國專使台維斯參加軍縮會議、聞爲維持顏面計、擬指派一「安全委員會」、待時進行、今日下午十三國代表曾開一預備會、部署明日幹部會議開幕、主席漢德森報告、本年三月以來軍縮談判之發展、觀察者以各國均各持成見、對前途咸抱悲觀、法國主張將軍縮事務仍歸國聯行政院辦理、再由國聯行政院另行指派一委員會、以各大國之代表組成之、並邀美俄參加、該新委員會重行草擬軍縮計劃、以締結互助公約爲根據、而實現法國之安全主義、眞正之軍縮問題反置不顧云、主席漢德森仍主張維持一九三二年十二月之五强議定書、而使德國重返日内瓦、該議定書已承認德之軍備平等、惟各國代表對於蘇俄外委李維諾夫甚爲注意、因其在此次會議中之地位與衆不同也（二十八國民電）</p>
<h3>法國政策受人側目</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法報已自認日　　内瓦方面法方形勢不利　　巴爾都外長受人側目、更令人難堪、對西門外相及漢德森之一味企圖德國、重返國聯、尤多訾議、而外間欲以軍縮破裂之責歸諸法國、益使此間報紙表示不平、若干報紙並載稱、巴爾都外長昨與西門外相會談、曾發生幾次公開衝突、故法方奮鬥之前途、猶在不可知之數、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英報所載日内瓦專電、已將日内瓦方面紛亂情形、揭示無遺、而法英對軍縮問題、意見愈形衝突、倫敦泰晤士報載稱、英代團對法外長巴爾都演說、缺少建設之主張、不無失望云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>日代表團抵日内瓦</h3>

<h3>應付遠東危機　俄先求西境安全　李維諾夫在日内瓦活動用意</h3>
<p>日内瓦訊、傳俄外務人民委員長李維諾夫之急來當地、由於遠東方面危機迫近、考盧應付之策、李氏於赴法前先語法外長云、「萬一事變發生不可避免、則俄國爲鞏固東方國境起見、以西部國境無懸慮爲急務、」又李氏於他處言明、俄政府現認日德兩國凖備戰爭、故軍縮會議參加國須速議俄政府提議之「侵略國定義條約、」且締結「地域的互助條約、」又李氏因俄政府將加盟、先訪羅外長恊議　恊商國之承認蘇俄問題、（世界社）</p>
<h3>爲和平而奮鬥　法俄意氣相投　俄入國聯係被動非主動</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯政府公報「伊斯維斯太報」</p>
<p>在其首篇標題爲「法蘇親善與和平成因」</p>
<p>之文中聲稱、「蘇聯輿論對於法外長巴爾都氏之演說、欣然歡迎、歐洲國聯會員各國、對於和平多抱杞憂態度、而法國之政策卽欲利用此種杞憂、以令國聯變爲較前更能保障和平之工具、故吾人如已洞察蘇聯政府對一切和平動議所給予之大量援助、則對於法國政策之正力謀將國聯内部所進行之爭取和平之鬥爭、與蘇聯所執行之同様鬥爭冶爲一爐一舉、不能認爲非常矣、若干國聯會員國家動議邀請蘇聯加入國聯、藉以增强國聯求得和平之奮鬥、並形成反戰爭傾向之鬥爭之聯合戰綫、巴爾都在法國會中宣稱蘇聯之加入國聯將爲歐洲和平之重要事件、此項友誼之動議、不僅根據於蘇聯之和平政策、且根據於蘇聯代表自身承認之事實、蘇聯政府對於若輩關懷和平、贊成蘇聯加入國聯之國家所作之論點、（如巴爾都關於其在日内瓦與李維諾夫所作談判之聲明所表現者）正在鄭重考慮、蓋此舉初非如各國報紙所誤傳者、出於蘇聯政府之主動、實則蘇聯政府在此舉中、僅對其他國家之動議表示贊成與否之態度耳、（廿八日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>法國名飛行家　巴黎直飛舊金山未成　三十八小時安然飛越大西洋　引擎發生障礙遂在紐約降落</h3>
<p>（紐約）羅西及考度氏打破紀錄之長距離直線飛行、自越大西洋後、已入於最危險階段、不幸引擎發生障礙、因於今日下午一時三十七分被迫降落本那廣塲、二飛行家自飛出紐芬蘭海岸上空之濃霧後、打破新紀錄似已不成問題、乃適於此時引擎發生障礙、深可惋惜、波士登海軍船塢先接得短電報告、兩飛行家遭遇機件障礙、未能打破去年夏季五六五三又四分之一英里之紀錄云、報告過簡、因此未能置信、正擬設法以無線電與羅西及考度氏通話、詎知飛機突然出現於飛行塲上空、繞塲一週放出三千立特爾汽油後、始停落機塲、羅西首出飛機、向援助彼等之飛行塲官員及工人微笑誌謝、考度氏於離開飛機時心神稍覺不寗、惟不久卽恢復原狀、二飛行家對於未能完成直達舊金山之壯舉、咸爲懊喪、羅西稱、此行甚感興趣、吾儕飛越大西洋時、除紐芬蘭海岸上空濃霧外、行程頗爲平靜云、二飛行家雖未能打破以前紀錄、然二度飛越波濤兇險之北大西洋、洵屬難能可貴、此次飛越大西洋需時三十八小時又二十七分、較諸加斯特及比侖脫三十七小時又十七分之紀錄爲緩、當二飛行家降落時、鵠候飛機塲之羣衆表示熱烈歡迎、紐約市亦依照舊例籌備歡迎云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）法國飛行家高多斯與羅西二人、於飛越大西洋後、業於本日午後六時三十八分、（格林維區鐘點以後仿此）在此間附近弗洛貝奈特飛機塲安然降落、其打破長距離飛行世界紀錄之企圖、雖已失敗、但究已完成巴黎與紐約間之飛航、前乎此者、僅一九三○年有法國飛行家高斯脫及白龍特而已、此次高羅二人所駕飛機、係三年以前造成、故其成績尤爲可驚、按二人係於昨晨五時十分飛出、全程歷時三十八小時二十二分、（一九三○年高斯脫及白龍特二人、爲三十七小時十八分、又一九二七年美國林白上校、由美飛達法國、歷時三十三小時又二十九分）、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀「讀書問答集　質疑」（二）</h3>
<p>丨一個人的特殊社會生活，能决定他的　　思想嗎丨</p>
<p>李赮楓君向我們提出了的關於「讀書問答集」讀後質疑之一，是「一個人的特殊社會生活，能影響並决定他的思想嗎？」這疑問的發生，由於我們在「社會科學初步讀法」一文内，（Ｐ·ｂｌ）會說過「這不僅他受了學派的影響，也是他的特殊社會生活，决定他接受了某一學派，排拒了另一學派」的話。現在我們爲要氷釋李君的疑團，不得不特别提出來加以閘明　　我們要明白一個人的思想，是否爲他的特殊社會生活所决定，我們必先要求出思想之所由產生，思想與社會生活有着若何的關係。</p>
<p>人的思想，是怎様產生出來的呢？有些人以爲是天賦的，這當然没有誰去相信，又有些人以爲是由頭腦這付機器自然製造出來的：頭腦簡單的人，思想也就遲鈍，簡單，頭腦健全的人，思想也就豐富，精密。白人比黑人的頭腦活潑發達，所以白人的思想遠超過於黑人，白人的文化也遠駕於黑人文化之上。這種論調，依然是似是而非的見解。我們固絕不否認，頭腦（神經系爲思想的發動機。一架機器，愈多用，　愈張活，久而不用，便易生銹，這道理也是顯而易見的。但我們要問，如果一家工廠，空有一架機器面没有原料，那機器是否仍可以製造出貨品呢？也就是說，一個人空有一個腦袋，而没有給這腦袋使用的原料，是不是仍可產生思想呢？毫無疑問，這是不可能的！坐井觀天的人，以爲天只有井口那麽大，這並不因爲他的腦袋褠造與别人不同，乃是限於他的見聞，他不能從、井口外看到更大的天的𢇐故。可見構成人類思想的，旣不是上帝，也决不單憑一個空洞的腦袋，而是那些外界的萬事萬物丨卽社會的存在。社會的複雜的現象，反映到人類的腦内，並經過精揀過程，便產生所謂思想。腦袋只有積聚選製的作用，而没有决定的作用。離開了存在，是談不到思想的。　　思想，旣是以複雜的社會現象作爲原料製造出來的東西，那未，一個人的思想，决不能超越他所處的環境和所與的社會，該是不置疑的事吧。中古時代的社會，產生不出民主政治的思想，但到現在，民主政治却又不時髦了。作爲萬世師表的孔子，無論現在還有人在那裏崇拜，但他的思想，比之現在一個普通人是要簡單得多的，因爲現在的社會，旣比孔子時代的社會複雜得多，人們的所見所聞，自然比孔子不知要豐富多少倍了。孫中山先生是一個偉大的革命家，思想家，假使我們要去理解中山先生的思想，離開他的特殊的社會生活，是無從說越的。中山先生的革命思想，爲什麽不發生於唐宋時代呢？顯然的，這旣非天意，也非唐宋時没有中山先生那様「天才」的人，而是那時還没有產生那種革命思想的社會條件。中山先生生當國際帝國主義侵入中國以後，舊社會的基礎旣經動搖，廢淸的政治日見腐敗，對内則極殘暴之能事，對外則完全失去抵抗力，而帝國主義經濟的，武力的侵略，又有加無已</p>
<p>，使民族生機，頻於危殆，這些事實，反映人中山先生的腦内，才形成了中山先生的革命思想。中山先生是廣東人，廣東是最早與帝國主義交通的地方，也就是受帝國主義壓迫最早最深的地方，雅片之戰，首當其衝的更是廣東。這點，更可以帮助了解中山先生的革命思想，所以决定於他的特殊社會生活的原因，而廣東之能成爲革命策源地也就在此。</p>
<p>綜上所舉例證，對於思想决定於社會生活的疑問，想朱君當已明其大槪。不過，還有問題的，是一個地主的兒子，爲什麽會同情於農奴，一個資本主義社會的學者，爲什麽會有反資本主義制度的思想，這情形，在朱君看來，定要以爲與我們的立論發生矛盾。其實不然！　　現在社會是不斷地在矛盾中發展着的。有了地主，便必然有農奴，有了資本主義，便必然有包含在資本主義内的許多映陷。一個前進的思想家，他不但看到社會的表面，而且要看到社會的内在，不慬看到社會的靜的方面，而且要看到社會的動的方面。舉例來說，屠格湼夫（俄國的大文毫）是一個地主的兒子，　他的獵人日記，却成了喊出「解放農奴」的呼聲的第一部名著。這原因，由於屠格湼夫看出了農奴制的醜惡，看到了農奴解放成爲當時社會的廹切要求，所以才違背了他自已的階級，而替農奴呌屈。他的這種思想，仍是從當時特殊的社會生活反映出來的。試問，如果當時没有農奴制，屠格湼夫的農奴解放思想將何由產生呢？孫中山與梁啓超同時，孫先生知到挽救民族危機，只有革命，而梁先生却只限於提出君主立憲。這種不同之處，不是别的，乃是梁先生只看到社會上的浮騅，所以他的思想是保守的；而孫先生乃能更深入的𥨖到中國社會的　結所在，中國社會應該而且正在向着那一方面發展，所以他的思想是前進的。這一切，僅僅指出一個人對於現社會應該怎様下一番深切的觀察，應該怎様應用他的頭腦，而絕不能提出作爲「思想决定於社會生活」的反證。</p>
<p>一個人的思想，必然是决定於他的特殊的社會生活，但怎様去使用自几的腦，怎様把視綫深入到社會的底層，却是各人自已的事。就思想整個過程上說，前者是内容，而後者只是構成思想的一種作用而已。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>（七）接駕</p>
<p>太后無論到什麽地方去，總得带着伊的樂隊同走；雖然這種習慣確有許多不便利，不經濟的地方，甚至會發生種種困難，但是伊却一槪置之不問！好在無論有什麽困難發生，自會有人去出力料理，絕對不致驚動伊自已的。我和慶善兩個人所担任的各項雜務之中，如果用筆記起來，就少不了這一條。我對於太后的這一班樂隊也有很熱烈的興趣，平日總是極注意地瞧着，聽着，倘有機會，便常去和他們接近，因此我不但對於每個樂工的名姓和技能，都有很深切的認識，我而且還能够玩弄任何一種樂器，至少限度，可以不致錯誤，當然也不敢說怎様精工。</p>
<p>這一班樂隊所用的樂器裏面，有幾種確然是很古的了。而牠們的大部份都各有一節十分動聽，而並不怎様可靠的歷史。凡能使用這種樂器的人，大槪都可以知道。說到這裏，我又不得不稱頌皇太后的知識的淵博了。普通人也許會誤認伊是一個見聞非常狹窄的老婦人，因爲伊是很難得到外面去的；然而事實恰好相反，伊所知道的，實在不比常人少。就像關於那些古樂器的來源和傳說，便是伊所告訴我的。</p>
<p>卽使在伊的寢宮裏，或内廷的其他部份，伊總是不讓那些樂工輕易遠離的；伊曾經把他們带到熱河去，這一次又把他們带到奉天去。（四六）</p>
<h3>黄魚</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>黄魚，一名春魚，是春夏二季裏，東南沿海數省每一個家庭中，最普遍的「思菜」，因爲是價廉味美的緣故。更其是從初夏起，越發的顯得是平民化了。</p>
<p>黄魚，有小黄魚，大黄魚之别。這是從形式分别的。還有因產地的不同，而分爲北洋貨與南洋貨。但分南北洋的，都是屬於鹹的。鮮黄魚是只有大小之别，没有南北之分。　　在上海，北洋鹹黄魚，是很名貴的。據說，漁船從華北各口，如營口，塘沽等地開出時，船是空空的。一路捕魚，一路南開，捕到，就放在船上晒，晒到吳淞口，就已成爲很好的鹹黄魚了，因爲海水裏是本來含有多量鹽質的。</p>
<p>因爲北洋鹹黄魚的鮮美味兒，是極被人歡迎的，於是南海裏的捕魚者，把鮮黄魚醃一下充北洋。但天然鹹與人造鹹，在老饕嘴裏，是一辨便知的。</p>
<p>小黄魚腹内，是附有寄生蟲的，形如一二寸長的綫頭。在初春時，是不多的。天氣愈熱，寄生蟲愈多。前些年曾一度喧傳着小黄魚腹内發現毒蟲。但據我吃黄魚的經騐，這種寄生蟲，經煮熟之後，對於人體健康，是没有影響的。而且這種蟲寄生的所在，是黄魚的腸胃，並不是肌肉，所以也不是絕對不能刳掉的。因此，我以爲大家儘不必因噎而廢食。</p>
<h3>屍體的解剖</h3>
<p>— 蔣德敬</p>
<p>當走過生理解剖館的前面，便可以嗅到一種刺激很强的藥水氣味。有的同學是掩鼻疾避，有的同學因激於好奇心，從窗户的隙空中向裏面探望；所看到的是一具具醬黄色的屍體，赤裸裸地仰臥在桌上，被穿白大衣的大學生們用刀鈎細細宰割着。有的已經露出上身根根的胸骨，有的是手臂上掛着一條條的肉絲，様子眞有點兒不忍卒睹。</p>
<p>若是種情形給頭腦冬烘的老先生們看見，更是要大嘆其世風日下，連死人都要玩弄起來了。其實呢，人死後是一個無知無覺的軀體，不是同供人們大嚼的紅燒鳥　和供人們觀賞的標本魚蟲一様嗎？雖然人是號稱萬物之靈，得天獨厚，生時旣要爭名競利，光前裕後，死後也得衣冠齊整，棺殮從豐，可是現在的事實告訴我們；所謂文明也者，不過是一個假面具。而最文明的歐美人士更是蛇蠍其心，天天想殺人，愈多愈好，因此那些被支配的人們，便都戰死沙塲，骨暴邱壑，再回顧我們的中国，年年内憂外患，民不聊生，死後連一口薄皮棺材，也得不到，而給狐狸野狗們大嚼。難道這種人都比死後給人解剖而得着知識來救濟人世的人們有福嗎？有益嗎</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十九回</p>
<p>回東足傷心自標獨活</p>
<p>聽　同歃血共誓精忠</p>
<p>趙自强雙手環抱在胸前，將脚尖連連點着，口裏念道：敵人在前面，别回頭看着家裏。正這様念着呢，忽然有一隻手在身後輕輕的拍着，回頭看時，正是營長寳芳。他先笑道：怎麽着？老趙，你想家嗎？自强笑道：不敢！不敢！寳芳執着他的手道：這幾天情形很緊，就靠我們一營人守這平安寨，守平安寨，就是守口子的頭一道關，這責任是很重大的，咱們到了今日，没有别的話說，就是把一腔熱血報答国家。自强聽了他說這話，自然也就把臉色沉着，答應了一聲是。寳芳道：我到這平安寨來的日了，早就說了，這裏應該有一旅人把守。就算少些，也應該有一團人，可是現在只有一營人了。我現在也不妨對你說實話，想口子裏再派人來，那是不行的了。因爲我們調兵調得快，敵人也就進攻攻得快。中国人對於公事，總是想凑合着拖過去的，以爲只要敵人不來進攻，把這口氣緩下去，就可以不打仗了。可是到了現在這局勢，人家能够不來進攻嗎？飛機不要緊，我想他們没有多大的威力，咱們也不是没有經過飛機鬥爭的。可是一件，敵人這唐克車可討厭。他若有兩三輛那東西掩護步兵進攻，可是一件麻煩。我已經向團長去了好幾個報告，非有幾挺平射砲不可。團長回信說，上面已經答應了。什麽時候，可以把平射砲撥到，那可難說，老實一點，咱們幹咱們的，可别管上面怎麽様了。自强道：我們有營長指導着，决計死守着這平安寨，眞到了那危急的時候，我想救兵一定會來的。（三九六）</p>
<h3>欺世之談</h3>
<p>— 士英</p>
<h3>十字街頭歷險記</h3>
<p>— 一震</p>
<p>電車站上，右旁停着丨休息着汽車，魚貫似的一連串兒。</p>
<p>想到老西門，電車却老是没有來，我性起了：「走啦！我們有脚唦！等什麽撈什子的車子，」我拖着老定，老定在注視着對街一個女人！行路，不聽見我的話兒。於是我笑着說：</p>
<p>「人家怕羞的，走吧；」</p>
<p>剛捱出了停着車子的車頭，放開了脚步前進的時候。</p>
<p>「喂！車子！」老定拉住了我，一輛夾灰的汽車，蛇様似的駛過了。</p>
<p>「哑！我驚呼起來，我的心像給汽車拉去了一様的驚慌的跳着，我低下了頭，覺察在我的鞋子上撒滿黄色的灰土，這灰土影上了一個血肉糢糊的屍體，靜穆的躺在馬路上。</p>
<p>「定！我幾乎與你永久的離别了！」半時我才迸出這話來，我臉上是浮上了笑，我知道這是苦笑。</p>
<p>「哈哈：：：」老定笑了，他在笑我的蠢呀！的確我是太愚魯了，啊！那邊一個女人也在笑我啦。</p>
<p>「哈哈：：：」我拭去了額上的汗，在瀝靑路上趵了幾脚，也算報復了剛才的驚嚇。我勉强的笑。</p>
<h3>上海世界</h3>
<p>— 天乎</p>
<p>上海，一份是達官要　　人的世界；一份是　　鉅商豪豪富的世界；一份是　　公子小姐的世界；一份是　　名士才子的世界；一份是伶官藝人的世界；一份是小　三世界；一份是人肉的世界；除了上述的有份之外，其餘的都外國人的世界，至於没有份的，那始終是没有份的。</p>

<h3>上海舊話</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>小子年未逾不惑，遜淸咸同年間事，未得目覩耳聞，不敢摭拾人言，據爲已作。姑就三十年來身所親歷而又有一記價値者。摘錄於左。名之舊話，實則非舊，聊以别於今之摩登派耳。</p>
<p>從前之人力車，車身漆黑色，輪以鐵爲緣。車過磷磷作響，殊聒人耳，俗稱爲「東洋車」，以其仿自東鄰故也。自改用橡皮輪後，車身亦漆作黄色，於是俗稱「黄包車」。「東洋車」三字，亦隨之而成過去之名詞矣。</p>
<p>自三洋涇橋至十六舖，車夫駕贏馬，曳敝車，招攬乘客，每次化錢三十文，滿五人則車駛，四人坐厢内，一人坐御者旁，當時名之曰「</p>
<p>野鷄馬車」，名不　馴，倘在今日，定名之曰「公用馬車」矣。</p>
<p>上海之駛行電車，大約在光緖未年。先駛行之一段，自老垃圾橋至外洋涇橋，共分二站。老垃圾橋至日昇樓爲一站，日昇樓至外洋涇橋又一站。坐一站銅元三枚，兩站祇五枚。</p>
<p>當時上海有河道三，悉東西横互者。</p>
<p>（一）蘇州河，爲英美租界分界處，（從前蘇州河以北，悉稱爲租界。）今尙存在。</p>
<p>（二）洋涇浜，爲英法租界分界處，今已塡平，卽愛多亞路是。</p>
<p>（三）城河浜，爲華法分界處，亦塡平，卽今之民国路及中華路是也。</p>
<p>光緖三十年八月，（是否已糢糊，總之相差不遠。）上海大水。平地水深二尺，車不能行。室中器物，悉受水漬。孩提在馬路中學游泳，便桶木器，飄至馬路上者亦比比是，煞是可觀。</p>
<p>上海的第一家新式的舞台，就是新舞台，最初設在十六舖，經理便是那頗有革命歷史而與陳英士共過事的沈縵雲氏。（已故）那時潘月樵夏月珊夏月潤等都在一起演戲，可是如今都已作古了。</p>
<p>上海游藝塲之最早者，當推樓外樓在新新舞台屋頂上（卽舊大蟾舞台原址，今已拆去。）塲中除佈置凹凸鏡及望遠鏡外，尙有魔術及蘇灘等，塲子頗少。顧生涯鼎盛，游人趨之若騖，足見物以稀爲貴也。自黄楚九氏創辦新世界，規模完備，塲子熱閙，於是樓外樓遂受淘汰。　　四馬路之靑蓮閣，滬人　不知其名。上層爲茗座，下層則爲小模型之游藝塲。有彈子台，有手搖電影機，有打拳機，下層階級咸爭趨之。當時尙有日人賃一舖面，搬演魔術，所演爲走鋼絲等類，亦能吸引看客。</p>
<p>前二十年，我人苟於茶坊酒肆小坐，輒見日本人持仁丹等，向客兜售，男女俱有。其實所售者，不止仁丹等藥品，尙有媚藥防毒器等，生涯頗佳，近十年則不見若輩蹤跡矣。</p>
<p>當時跑馬廳春秋二賽，頗吸動華人，四鄕城鎭來滬看跑馬者，亦視爲一熱閙事。貧氓於跑馬塲之栅外，舖椅擱板，作高台形，便人登觀，每次每人收錢二三十文不等。至王孫豪賈，輒挾名妓坐鋼絲輪馬車，所謂亨斯美者放舊於南京路上，視爲豪舉云。</p>
<p>舊事重重，不能盡憶，恐費筆畢，於此作一結束。</p>

<h3>記五卅一烈士</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>在小學校讀書的時候，聽敎師講鴉片之戰及八國聯軍破北京的事情，就看見許多同學們，揑起小拳頭來，表示憤激，其中有一位，便是一九二五年喋血在南京路上的何君秉彝。學校是在四川新繁縣淸流塲上的火神廟裏，但我與秉彝却都是來自鄕下，爲了要抵制塲上的流氓孩子的侮辱起見，我們總算是聯成一氣的。他們街上的小傢伙，最使人生氣的一點，是愛在你的面前，說些不堪入耳的話，甚至像男性對待女性那様的混賬言語，也會常常使用出來。因此，秉彝和我都不得不變成好和人打架的孩子了。如今一憶起了這位糼年之日的同伴，那打腫了眼睛還在微笑的勇敢様兒，便分明地浮現出來。　　秉彝和他的弟弟秉均，都同我在三年級的課室裏讀書，敎師因見他努力過人，功課進步得太快，就把他提到四年級去上課，但自修的時候，却還是同我們在一塊兒的。有一次演算一道乘除法的難題，個個人都在黑板上遭到失敗了。於是，許多小頭臚便全在敎師的埋怨聲中低垂着。這時秉彝剛從四年級課室裏上課回來了，敎師便呌他上講　去演習，馬上就「一舉成功」。從此，三年級的孩子，都目他爲「了不得的小傢伙」。</p>
<p>他住在西面的鄕下，我却在相反的東面，因此他家的情形，並不十分明瞭，不過知他得有個太嚴厲太可怕的祖母罷了。有時放學出來，在街上玩耍，便聽見秉彝忽然警覺地喊他的弟弟道：</p>
<p>「呵呀，走哪，走哪，奶奶又要駡我們了！」</p>
<p>當時他的父親是在法政學當讀書，這由於一次由成都來信託囑敎師督責兒子用功的事情，我們才知道了的，同時也引起了小心靈的詫異：爲什麽父親還同兒子一様地讀書呢？弄在一個學校那才有趣哩後來他家移到彭縣城裏，我們便没有見面，也不通音息了。直到我在成都</p>
<p>師範學校讀書時，才嘵得他在高等工業學校肄業，很想去會他，但却没有勇氣，因爲心裏起着一種慚愧，覺得他上進得太快，在學級上已經超過我幾個年頭。不過後來他知道我了，便自動地突然跑來會晤，带着非常和善的年靑臉子。只是稍稍現出交際上的能幹和圓滑，與我性情不大相合，因此，算是曾經一度重續的友情，便又中斷了，而且成最後一次的相見和離别。</p>
<p>不久，聽見他進了上海大學，接着又得着他殉難的消息，才失悔我對這様人爲什麽意有了錯誤的見解，而不在成都的時候，多多同他會面呢？同時覺得糼年之日數十個對洋鬼子憤激的小侶伴中，意然有一位走去實行而且流了最後的血了，便在心上感到光榮和喜悅，雖然也還滲雜着悲哀。</p>
<p>人已離世快十年了，但那打腫眼睛還在微笑的小臉兒，却仍鮮活地映在我的眼前，使人忘記不得。於今五卅又當頭了，且把牠移在紙上，聊作紀念吧</p>

<h3>縱横無用論</h3>
<p>— 皞</p>
<p>小年人讀史記國策，往往不免有些憧憬於蘇秦張儀。又當今之世界大勢，有點像春秋戰國，結果是希望自已或有人能「掉三寸不爛之舌」，游說歐洲各處，或者合從，或者連衡：：：而使中國强盛。</p>
<p>天下事不過爾爾，翻來覆去，無非老譜中的幾着，不免使英雄動念，豪傑生心。這種動機，想使中國富强，本身是無可議的。這已就超過徒知請安唱喏的當局者流。也超過許多賣國好手。</p>
<p>然而呀！使志士灰心者，「以夷制夷」的方法早用不着了，夷人淸楚華人比華人淸楚夷人或華人淸楚華人還要淸楚，而縱横捭�飛箝反間許許多多制夷制狄的方法，結果是只能在强者手中運用，反而制華了。因爲今古之勢不同，而高下之情亦異。譬如人家吃一方猪肉，彼此容或有紛爭，倒從來不聞猪肉那方面有什麽動靜的。此其一。</p>
<p>又要然而了，然而陰謀之類，或能收頃刻之效力，從來也不能成事功。譬如食物中的酸辣品，不能養生，久已失其刺激。以一點小詐術欺騙大的實力，古謂之「不祥」，現在想來也很危險的。縱或成功，終於不濟。這是就陰謀本身論，也不健康，此其二。</p>
<p>所以許多人從袁項城，李鴻章：：：一直佩服到諸葛亮，或更佩服到蘇秦，張儀，子貢，晏婴。那結果是非常不好的。理想中的典型旣不高妙，學出來的躄脚當然無功。要掩映一時代的人物，披靡現存的一切威權，而使這民族强盛起來，應該從高處遠處着手。</p>
<p>古代縱横家漸漸消滅，也不大有人研究了，大槪因爲這些道理。丨</p>
<h3>藴藏在南國裏的火</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>丨寄遠在赤道下尙在掙扎着的朋友們丨</p>
<p>十九嵗時，曾被生活的壓迫漂流在南荒。</p>
<p>爲了曾被人海的狂濤所蹂躪，那時的　弱的心　是滿戳上了創傷。對於光明的希望的幻滅，對於未來的無限的慾望，和對於生的網的層層的纏繞，造成我一個矛盾和複雜的錯綜的心情。</p>
<p>「到南洋去吧！」便自對自這麽說着。</p>
<p>於是從那擁擠着的人潮裏爬上新加坡的海岸，觀光這殖民地的帝國主義的威風。一月後又從新加坡轉入蘇門答　，當當荷蘭小帝國的辛辣的滋味。五年來不住地在英，荷，兩屬輾轉，飽　椰風棕雨的辛忙，也爬慣了荒林野徑。自已旣然親享着帝國主義的虐待的賞賜，也眼看着僑胞在「不景氣」的鐡掌下痛苦呻吟。一二八的砲火燃燒了僑衆的熱情，和約的簽訂也激起了僑衆的憤火。我看見失業的僑衆被一批批地放逐歸來，也看見悽凉的勞工呑淚飲血。五年來自已的生活隨着僑衆的浮沉而浮沉，我深深地呼吸着僑衆的脈息。</p>
<p>南國赤士的氣息至今使我莫忘，荒林的野火至今如見。曾經有浪跡天涯的農工的淚點滴在我的身邊，也曾經見着被革命所抛棄的靑年學子在海邊垂淚。一切痛心的故事使我未敢再聽，一切悽慘的景象令我不敢目睹。</p>
<p>也曾經在南荒化費我靑春的精力，滴下我的熱淚，灑出我的情熱，：：：我愛那裏的愚蠢而樸質的下等同胞，我更愛我的活潑而健康的小孩子們。我愛僑團的糼稚的文化，我也愛僑胞間的同國人的情愛。我敬仰僑衆的辛苦勤勞，我也讚美他們爲自已所滴下來的血汗。我　　　削考，我處　那　藏　　文明的　　下的　惡的　孔。</p>
<p>然而一同地被「不景氣」的巨濤所抛棄，一同地受帝國主義的壓迫，我隨着勞苦的僑衆們的被逐而歸來，我在離别時灑下我的痛苦的眼淚，我懷着一個火山般的憤火。</p>
<p>漂泊在南荒的五個年頭算已了結，我把這些痛苦的血淚織在我的心頭，我把牠織在文字裏。我向國人呼喊！我也向世界呼喊！</p>
<p>然而我的力量是這様微弱，我的呼喊似乎空發。我翹首望天，南國裏還滿貯着僑民的淚水；他們盼望救援，他們也希求劇烈的變革。什麽時候是光明的時代到來？什麽時候將有個被壓迫者抬頭的時候？</p>
<p>勞苦的僑衆們手聯着手，足接着足，爭個光明的未來吧！爭個自由的世界吧！</p>
<p>我謹祝着他們。我鼓勵着他們。</p>
<h3>五卅之歌</h3>
<h3>跳梯（三）</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>「等一刻，我們底命運會怎様呢？」一個中年人設問着。</p>
<p>「我却看淸楚了，我們這年頭預備縛緊肚子捱餓好了。就算把租减少了些，怎麽塡得起這」大窟窿呢？那些飽衣足食的，怎會替我們設法呢？難道農夫一輩子要吃苦的？」有一點斑白鬍子的人黯然地說。</p>
<p>「我底兒子簡直異想天開呢，他說他們把那！！」長了鬍子的老人說着，像顧忌着什麽似地把聲音按低了，「把田地完全佔了，窮的人都分一份，等個個也不要捱餓：：：」可是，我不讓他說下去哩。</p>
<p>阿梅被什麽驅使着，遲疑地站起身來，輕着脚步走到客堂外邊，脚兒被矛盾的思想停止下來，裏面單調的男人底痴肥的語音，打斷她底思路。</p>
<p>「就是想補償這個損失，我跟鄕董們商量了好幾次！！」</p>
<p>他把喉頭的痰淸一淸，繼想說，「農民救濟會不是很好聽的名字麽？只收四分利息，要在」</p>
<p>一年内本利歸還：：：這事生意是滿好做的，可惜我拿不出多少本錢！城裏的兒子丨丨就是在法科學院的，就要畢業了，又要錢了，唉：：：」</p>
<p>阿梅堅决地走前兩步，站着正想告訴主人門外已經有幾個人等候他的時候，她後面起了一陣粗率的男人底語音，她回過頭來，四個男人站在她背後了。驚詫使她低下頭向裏面跑去，男人底談判的聲音在她腦後揚起來。</p>
<p>過後，黄大爺咆哮起來駡着：</p>
<p>「你這趕錢出門外的東西，奴隷眞有底性格呵：：：又不是跟那些老猴子偷情，爲什麽帮着他們呢」。</p>
<p>阿梅底眼睛無目的地釘着白色的天空，愁苦的口角吐出那淸楚的話語，衝破证人們吼駡的震　的聲音。</p>
<p>「我没有讓他們進來呀」！</p>
<p>主人們用强烈的手段應付着，把這在太陽底下的向日葵花様硬直地站着的阿梅屈服下來。最後，女主人底臉現了一條條的横紋，兇狠地說：</p>
<p>「我一定把你嫁到一個最窮的耕家那兒去：：：以後，你再不要想自由地進出呀！不安分的人那有好結果的」。</p>
<p>阿梅底性子，像在黑黯的角落裏生了根的樹木様地頑固起來，眼睛比從前灰黯了些，更陰森而呆滞。主人底高聲的呌喚，往往她底黏滞的身軀起了一種驚跳。</p>
<p>「爲什麽没人把我带出去呢」？她有一天對那替主人磨粉的女人說。</p>
<p>「你在這兒有飯吃不好麽？你只要把心放寛點，什麽地方也隨便混混便了，鄕下人怎様能够離開飯」！那婦人特别加重末尾那字的聲音，好像牠曾經把她拉到生活底辛辣的液汗裏面浸透了，隨時都要發洩她底變態的厭恨來，然而對方搖首了。</p>
<p>十九嵗的阿梅用新的變換底驚喜和怯顫伴着她底瘦長的身軀到村南的陌生的婆家去了。</p>
<p>婆婆底精細而習慣地温柔的目光，使阿梅暗地裏歡慰了一下。</p>
<p>「婆家雖然第，然而還有兩三畝田地咯。自古起家由於勤儉呀」！婆婆敎訓着媳婦，「男人底脾氣，一定要懂得，不要使他變成了一匹狼：：：」她底微黄而閃出精幹的光亮眼睛，使阿梅底胸口驚悸地跳動着。她捧住了好奇的心情在恐怖的預感裏緊張地過活。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>亞洲佛敎徒大團結</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>日本對華政策自採取外表態度悠然，實則上趾爪忙動的「水鳥外交」之後，有吉就按此意旨發表他擬定的甘誘入彀，收買漢奸，武力凖備的三個步骤。這些談論自然與「百靈」外交不同，他們確是說而能行，行而且積極，雖則有不少的人正自閙着奪錦標開會議，一若太平無事，然而别人却絲毫也不吹牛的按着他三個步骤，眞正的在「趾爪忙動」。</p>
<p>國家大計的通車通郵設關等問題，據傳一方面在積極凖備，一方面則絕端認，内中眞相小民不得而知，也就這且不提，且容我談談「不带政治意味」拾零的小事。東京展覽會的歡迎「新聞界」是早過去了，北平的「國際觀光團」及利用猶太民族來宣傳的亞洲民族團結正在喧閙，雖然有人大聲疾呼斥以「甘誘」，畢竟總有人「入彀」。最近更走馬燈式的來了又來，花様翻新，從東京外務省文化事業部的口裏喊出了「亞洲佛敎徒大團結」。</p>
<p>據報載，日外務省推坪内就任東方文化事業部長職後，便積極進行「宗敎政策」。近以「亞細亞之再認識」作宣傳標語，將召集汎太平洋佛靑大會，其目的如前所組織之大亞細亞同盟爲亞洲門羅主義之表現機關；同時并宣佈兩項綱領：（一）促成亞細亞佛敎羣衆之團結；（二）闡掦亞洲文化，濟世濟民。這一綱領自然光明正大，因之參加者除僞組織蒙古印度爪哇南洋朝鮮台灣等代表外，也將有我國代表某某法師等。</p>
<p>佛敎是素主淸凈無爲的，因之有不少的皈依佛門者流，均不願　身名繮利鎖之場，飄然高舉遠引。可是二十世紀的「釋迦牟尼」也許進化了，所以我們看見許多手掣鋼刀的將軍，涉身廟堂的名公要人，也手拈佛珠口念彌陀，風猷所屈，横暴的侵略者也由文化事業部「主謀」，發起汎太平洋佛靑大會，靈山會上，面我宗師，那得不懿歟盛哉！</p>
<p>帝國主義的侵略弱小民族是各方面的，所以中國除軍艦大砲的鎭壓，經濟勢力的抑制外，在十字架的掩護下，也不知喪失多少主權與土地。時事的遷移，木屐朋友竟抬出如來佛來作他的法寳了，因之我們對這些佛門代表將要在汎太平洋佛靑會與僞組織托鉢周旋，其用意豈僅在「辱國」而已。考察他「亞洲佛敎羣衆團結」的綱領，與乎以作亞細亞門羅主義之表現機關的目的，自然足見其司馬之心。十字軍東征爲歐洲商業資本主義開拓東方市塲，傳敎自由衝破了各殖民地的閉關自守，都是歷史上最好的鑑證。</p>
<p>至於所謂闡揚亞洲文化，濟世濟民，就與獨覇遠東的宣言互爲表裏。這兒就看到四一七宣言雖由廣田宣稱未「正式存在」而撤消，但憑他外表悠然趾爪忙動的政策，却企圖向英美的南洋印度等地，施行進一步的侵襲，此亞洲佛敎徒團結之所以爲亞洲佛敎徒團結也。</p>
<p>我們呢，列席佛靑會將同參觀東京展覽會一様，行者自行，反對者自反對。不是在東京電氣俱樂部歡宴會上早就有佛敎徒「求已不求人」的演講麽，此次參加者川資日金四百元，我是奉勸全國的「居士」「佛門之子」相率前去，這是我們的「宗敎政策」。</p>
<h3>新多心經</h3>
<p>— 馬嬰</p>
<p>一連幾夜，弄堂裏鬧得托托地響：時常這響聲從我的窗下經過，把我從夢中驚醒。早晨開開門來，第一眼就瞧見那個光光的腦袋，心裏一蹩扭，忍不住就要駡：「怪不得不如意事常八九，原來是碰見你；秃驢丨」</p>
<p>今天早晨又被那響聲驚醒了，一骨碌下了床，找着一根打狗棍，衝到外面去·那意思，似乎是去訪一個什麽朋友，或者到那裏去散步一回。</p>
<p>終於在一個朋友家裏停下了。那朋友向來是個有趣的人，可是今天却不然，不言不語，坐在一張矮塌上，様子很像老僧入定了。我覺得很奇怪，便問今天爲什麽冷淡我？朋友一笑，搖搖頭說，」你不要誤會，並不是冷淡你。因爲我做了和尙了，所以不能和你多談。」</p>
<p>我心裏想，眞倒霉；訪朋友也訪着一個半路出家的秃貨，好像秃貨偏與我有緣，到處都離不了我。於是我不高興的說，「卽做了和尙，就應該知道幾卷經咒。你呢，我知道你平日大魚大肉，連五戒都不能遵守，更談不到什麽經咒了。野和尙；假充佛門弟子，虧你羞不羞」</p>
<p>？朋友又搖頭說，「别瞎駡我，我唸一」卷經給你聽：這是觀音菩薩親自傳授我的，呌帮新多心經。他果然高聲朗誦道：「性兒靜靜，心兒悄悄。無憂無慮，不知不曉。呼呼一覺，直到雞呌，睜眼醒來，哈哈一笑。」他唸完，便哈哈笑起來。</p>
<p>這時我不能再說笑話了。我覺得我那朋友，眞是一個道高德厚的人物。因爲倘天下衆生，都能依照他的話去做，無憂無慮，不知不曉，放倒頭便睡，睜開眼就笑，那天下才可以風調雨順，永遠昇平。</p>
<h3>女招待</h3>
<p>— 古月</p>
<p>北四川路上照滿了年紅燈的光，一條又直又光滑的馬路，配着白嘩嘰的褲子罩着白黑皮鞋，飄飄的長旗袍襯着没穿襪子的大腿，一對一對地，很有秩序地走過。當每一對走近靶子路的時候，最値得注意的是紐約飲冰室將軍紅燈下，靠在門口的女招待，一個美麗的姑娘，滿面浮着初夏的微笑。</p>
<p>嘉和我是一對没事的夜遊神，嘉最近是失戀了每天晚上跑到飲冰室去，嘉鍾情那女招待，我同情着那女招待，因爲有一次，當我走進這飲冰室的時候，那姑娘春風滿面歡迎着我們，嘉情不自禁地說：</p>
<p>「姑娘，一同來喝一杯冰淇淋吧！」</p>
<p>她不語，含笑着又添了一杯，一屁股坐在嘉的旁邊。</p>
<p>「姑娘，你是那裏人？」</p>
<p>「浙江。」</p>
<p>「你讀過書嗎？」</p>
<p>「怎様没讀過呢？我還是高中二年級呢？」</p>
<p>「婦女的出路。」我嘆一口氣。</p>
<p>「那未，你不念你的書，爲什麽來做女招待呢？」</p>
<p>「家裏没人生產，哥哥父親都不務正業，媽媽靠着十指過活，可是年又老了。念書怎様念得起呢？所以我不得不走進這陷阱」她幽　地說着，沉默了好久，終以她不能忍耐了，嘆了一口氣，繼上的是興憤的談話。</p>
<p>「我曾可憐過女招待，我曾說過，女招待是堕落的，最近我還病駡過平市長鼓勵女生爲招待呢？可是，想不到，最近，就是前一個星期，我也是爲前人所咒駡的女招待了，我怎能不傷心呢！」說着，險些流了眼淚來。</p>
<p>嘉沉默着，好似是懺悔；我沉默着，一肚子的同情，無從發洩；她一聲不發地注視着那粉紅色的冰淇淋。</p>
<p>「喂！四號·刨冰！」</p>
<p>「噢！」姑嘆息着一口氣說，「對不住！」</p>
<p>「嘉，你還該有野心嗎？我們該憐惜她！」</p>
<p>是，我懺悔了，等她來，我還要勸戳她呢！」</p>
<p>「喂，再來兩杯鷄日刨冰。」這是呌她來的唯一法門。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>果然，不久她手裏拿着兩杯刨冰，含笑的走了來。</p>
<p>「再坐一會，可以？」她不語，坐下了。</p>
<p>「姑娘，我勸你不必悲哀了，女招待中像你的也很少，拿出你的勇氣力，向惡劣的環境奮鬥！你是高中生，總該懂我這句話吧！」</p>
<p>「謝謝你！」</p>
<p>「我們沉默的坐了半天，拿一張鈔票塞進她的手裏，踱了出來。</p>
<h3>賣買</h3>
<p>— 淑賢</p>
<p>正當女工們發放工資的上一天，那摩温的手裏拿着一塊小小的花布，臉上堆着一層狡猾的笑容，挨次地走到每個女工的前面，向着說：「看這布多好呵！價錢又便宜，只賣一塊錢一丈呢！：：：：：」</p>
<p>過去的經騐告訴過她們，大家都知道那摩温又在搗鬼了！其中比較聰明一點的不等那摩温的話說完，卽勿忙地奪着𢺄住說：「乾娘所說的眞眞不錯呀！這好的布料又這便宜的價錢，假使我不是昨天買過了布的話，一定要請乾娘替我帮忙買點。」</p>
<p>「但是無論如何你還得買一境錢的，孩子！你知道這是别人托我的事，我不能推脫，你們也應該替我撑撑面子。未來的日子長着呢？而且你們今天以後也還要在這兒做生活呵！」那摩温深知這些窮困的女工們，要拿出一塊錢來就如殺了她們一刀一様地心疼，她唯有採取這堅硬的命令式的辦法逼迫着。</p>
<p>那摩温爽利地開了硬口，女工們都知道再無法避免這一塊錢的竹槓了！只好苦笑着向她輕輕地點了點頭，她這才含笑着前進了兩步，又挨次走向第二個女工的前面。</p>
<p>阿金的年齡畢竟太小，腦筋笨，當那摩温同様地拿着那塊小小的花布走向她的面前向她說着同様的話時候，她並不像其他的女工們用那様的話來回答，她却表示着不高興地鼓起了小嘴，搖着頭說：「乾娘上次賣給我襪子一塊錢四雙，拿回家去爸爸說那貨色就只賣一角錢一雙都没人買呢，這布我却不要，再上當爸會要打我呀！」</p>
<p>「這話的確嗎？」那摩温那狡猾的笑容一刹眼不見了，另換着一副鐡靑得怕人的面孔。</p>
<p>「不！我是没錢呀！乾娘也知道上關餉我只拿到五塊工錢。：：：：」阿金看着那摩温的臉有點害怕，她苦着臉顫聲地說。</p>
<p>「那未，明天你不要再來上工了！」那摩温說着回頭凖備走開，却被阿金慌忙地扯住了衣角。</p>
<p>「乾娘！我買！：：：一塊錢的！：：：：」。阿金的眼淚到了腮邊，她的呼吸和聲音都是那様地促迫。</p>
<p>「　　　　的好　子阿！將來要乾　　順你的日子正多着呢！」那摩温又笑了！走到另一個女工的前面。</p>
<p>第二天我們的那摩温拿着許多用商店招牌紙包着的小包，一件件挨次地遞給每個女工，每個女工都是那様免强地從衣袋裏掏出一張抄票塞到她的掌心裏。</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>繼母</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個將近成年的女子。五年前，在小學讀書時代，本是很快活的。那知天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍褔世上唯一愛護我的人（母親）與我不别而行了。那時我的父親是很富有的，所以卽取了一位繼母。繼母對待我的態度，當然不言可喻。不料褔無雙至不單行，父親經商，又突告失敗，加上滬戰，現下一貧如洗，家内一切費用難以支持，我覺這様下去。很是危險，所以商得父親同意，暫在親戚店中任職，早出晚返，略得酬勞。老　時常擺出老　的架子，嚕哩嚕囌，但我因爲生活問題，所以中得忍氣呑聲。晚上工畢回家，還要帮助繼母，料理一切，稍不如意，就要受她冷言白眼。我因爲不願和她口角，所以亦只得忍氣呑聲。近數月來待我尤加不行了。因爲她在二月前產了一個孩子了。我從早晨六點鐘起身，替她整理一切，卽怱怱的趕到店中，忙忙碌碌做到晚上九點半回家，又要替她洗滌衣服及小孩的尿布等，還要做其他雜務，最早十二點半才得睡覺。他呢？早晨到晚上，手裏抱了小孩，别的事都不管了，還說是非常辛苦。而我從早晨六點工作到夜裏十二點餘，如刦視　　　，反而要冷　冷語的對我。現我舉一個例，以示她對我用心的險惡。</p>
<p>前月某日，皐晨天氣很温暖，我穿了一件夾衫到店中，不料到下午三點鐘後，忽起　風雨，天氣　寒，十分難忍。我想繼母知我是穿夾衣面來的，或者會使人送件棉衣來給我。但到晚亦没有送來，我只得忍到工畢回家，要緊換上棉衣。她又冷冷她說，「你自已賤骨頭呀，早晨棉衣亦不穿，自已要凍呀？」</p>
<p>唉！先生你想，早晨這様的温暖。呌我如何穿得上棉袍子。我没有和她辯論，祇是暗中哭泣。</p>
<p>現在我覺靠家庭希望已完全没有了。所以極力想謀自立，但我深知若要自立，必先能經濟獨立，若要經濟獨立必須要有相當的　業，要想謀相當的職業，必須要有相當的智識和技能，但我自問技能全無，雖有自立之志，却不能實現。又不知何種職業於女子最爲相宜？智，能，又從何處可得到？若要想離開這萬惡的家庭及這頑固的商店，又該怎様着手？唉！難極了。</p>
<p>我想想前途是非常之黑暗，無法可想了，唯有請求高明的先生，一一指敎爲幸此祝</p>
<p>撰安　　　　Ｃ敬上</p>
<p>答：繼母虐待前母子女，在中國社會裏是很普通的現象，要擺脫這種痛苦，「謀自立」確是唯一的辦法。照你的意思，謀職業要有工作技能，這話固然不錯，然而在現在這失業人數激增時代，有了技能也不敢保瞪你定能獲到職業。而且，像你這種家境，恐怕不能再容許你去讀書所以等到有了技能再去找職業，事實上未必見得會辦到。我想，你目前對於家庭及你服務的店家不必急急乎想離開。繼母給你受氣，可以馬虎的地方，你就不必計較，自已也不要氣，如果眞日是難堪的話，那你也不能一味退讓隨她擺佈。你可向父親訴苦，如父親不理，並可告訴旁人，請人家主持公道。受老　的氣，當夥計的人是無法避免的，你也可取對繼母的態度對他。另一方面，你再極力謀機會，物色像你這種能力可以幹得來，同時酬報又較豐的職業，如公司女職員之類。如果找到了較好的職業，繼母看見你在經濟上有帮助，勢利心人所難免，對你就不會再像以前那様刻薄了，在這時，你就應利用機會努力自修或者入補習學校學習點工作能力。至於說到適合於婦女的職業，在這個婦女職業不發達的時候，是很難說的，小學敎師會計，打字等就一般論是比較適合於婦女的。</p>
<p>另外，還有一點你雖没有提到，似也應注意。現在職業婦女除了受老　的氣外，還要受到「花瓶」等侮辱，這種情形，在公司大商店内尤爲顯著，你對於這種待遇精神上痛苦固然不必，却也應願慮周到，愼謀應付的態度。編者</p>

<h3>五月的薔薇</h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>看見了粉色的薔薇，夢似的回憶就會痛嚙了我的心。　　粉紅色的夢呀！</p>
<p>時間是像雲一般的悠遠了！或者我才十八嵗吧。我失掉了我的家，孤獨的一身　着滿懷的頽創；流浪在杭州的時候，粉紅色的夢帘輕地拉開了：</p>
<p>每晚每晚，湖濱公圜里不會找不到我的足跡，我常常會依倚着錬欄，默默地迎着月亮起來，讓月亮的光輝把靜穆的湖面飾成一面大鏡子；有時甚至會默默地送着月亮回去！讓那湖面淡灰，淺灰！深灰地暗下去，暗下去。</p>
<p>某一晚（是春天呵），我照例在湖畔躑躅了一番之後，默默地依着欄杆，悵望着銀色的碎波，情威里迸出了慘痛的遐思丨丨好久好久，被微風带來了一陣淫樂的笑聲！那夜遊的划子呵。</p>
<p>理智再不能抑制奔流的創感，碎波的閃動在眼前糢糊起來（視線被眼眶里的液體掩阻了啦。）拉起顫抖的嗓子，没有靈魂似地：</p>
<p>（你家在那兒呵？）</p>
<p>我没有家！</p>
<p>我底家是被野獸呑嚙了的村莊！</p>
<p>（你的愛人在那兒呵？）</p>
<p>我没有愛！</p>
<p>我的愛人是被野獸擄去了的姑娘！</p>
<p>罪惡的黑手呵！</p>
<p>你把光明歛去了輝煌！</p>
<p>唱完了，自已像一隻失羣的沙鷗！當一縷輕風吹來的時候，我發覺我頰上有兩行怪冷的皮膚。</p>
<p>驚覺了自已的行爲似回過身來丨丨那長椅上坐着一個穿着黑色衣裳的姑娘。</p>
<p>月亮的光茫蓋着那姑娘：臉兒爲蒼白呵，頰上也掛着兩條銀色的淚。</p>
<p>我同情似地望望她；她同情似地望望我！可是，我於終於悄悄地淄開了。</p>
<p>每晚每晚，我總在這種情景之下淄走的。</p>
<p>十幾次以後；她不待我淄走，顫抖地。</p>
<p>「先生，你的聲音太悲慘了：：：」</p>
<p>「唔唔：：：」我囁嚅地。</p>
<p>「先生，請你不必懷疑我，我是十分同情你的人。」</p>
<p>「姑娘，我不相信這世界上有同情我的人；我更不願意這世界上有同時我」</p>
<p>的人！」</p>
<p>她哭了。</p>
<p>這様，我從此和她就構成了一段羅曼司。</p>
<p>在西子湖畔的幾個别墅里薔薇開得血紅的時候，我倆的羅曼司也像薔薇似的美麗着。</p>
<p>過了兩個月緋色的生活，她突然失踪了；她没有一個紙條兒給我，事物上也絕没有一點兒出走的破綻；她那里去了啊？那里去了啊？至今我還是渺茫的。</p>
<p>粉紅色的夢啊！</p>
<p>現在　我着見了粉紅色的薔薇，夢　的回憶就會痛嚙了我的心。</p>

<h3>新道奇之　獨立彈簧裝置簧</h3>
<p>溯自道奇六缸新車出世以來。其所裝之獨立彈簧系。亦遂卽喧腾於衆口。按其功能使每一前輪。各自直起直落。而不致影響於另一輪之彈簧系。係以堅强螺絲彈簧組成之。構製極爲簡單。兼且毫無煩難。此項彈簧。位置介於。一在車架上邊。及一在車架下邊。兩Ｖ形支桿之間。藉支撑肘鈕支臂。而接連其兩端。至於上Ｖ支桿之腿部。則附連於雙重作用之吸震器。</p>
<p>獨立前彈簧系。歐洲各處固已不乏採用者但新道奇所裝者。乃歷經多時之嚴格測騐而成。其效用有未可相提並論者。普通汽車之前彈簧。係以一一重叠之一串扁葉組成之。車輪一遇障碍。扁葉卽行屈曲。惟以此爲底盤與前軸及輪盤間僅有之運緊。故欲保持前輪及輪軸對於車輛之正常關係。實惟前彈簧是賴。更因路面崎嶇不平。每致車輪失却其正當位置。於是爲全車着想。自必裝配堅硬程度足以抗拒此種動作之彈簧。至運用塞車時。車輪欲其停止。而車之前進力。則欲使其繼續前進。因斯彈簧之堅强性。又必足以勝任此種推動力。是凡此種種。蓋皆普通汽車之前彈簧。所以不得不採用具有相當堅强性者。按以事實而讑。彈簧愈柔靭。則車之乘駛品質亦愈佳。此固確定不移之理。並已早爲人所讅知。徒以上述原因。未能應用之耳。再如應用較爲柔軟之彈簧。則其長度自必隨之增加。但在普通汽車。彈簧長度。固自有其限制。若僅顧及其適當軟度。則在另一方面。將嫌其過長。或竟至突出於車前。普通車輛。所以未能應用較軟彈簧者。此蓋其又一原因也。</p>
<p>道奇工程師有鑒於此。特廢棄普通設計。另行完成一種懸置方法。俾道奇出品。可應用柔軟適度之彈簧。新道奇六缸車之獨立前彈簧懸置。對於凡百需要。無不應付裕如。除以一上一下之兩堅固Ｖ支桿。保持車輪與底盤之正常關係。而使每一輪盤。可自由上下起落外。彈簧之唯一功用。厥爲墊襯汽車。以防路面一切崎嶇不平。按此種螺絲彈簧。如經展放。則較尋常汽車之前彈簧。約長四倍。且或較車之輪距爲長。再此新彈簧及獨立彈簧懸置之裝用。不僅乘駛彌極安適。車之管理。亦且便易非凡。蓋以車輪並不接連於鞏固輪軸也。</p>
<h3>美国汽油　漏稅爲數可觀　年達二百萬元之鉅　九州當局設法防止</h3>
<p>— 摩亞</p>
<p>美国汽車事業之發達爲世界各国冠。其每年所產銷之汽油爲數亦殊可觀各州政府及聯邦政府所取資於汽油之徴稅。年達千百萬元。爲政府之一大收入。胆奸商私販之流。往往以有利可圖。偷運汽油出境。漏稅之鉅。年以百萬元計。政府當局以此事有關国庫。不得不從嚴取締。近乃有九州政府派員會議之舉。以杜偷漏。集會之地點在約紐。召集此會議者則爲紐約州稅捐財政部長葛萊和氏。參加此會議者爲紐約·紐裘賽·本薛文尼亞·康腦的干·麥色　雪滋·浮蒙脫·第拉威·麥萊蘭特·及羅特島各地之稅務委員。</p>
<p>此會議之唯一目的。乃在九州間之互助徴稅。及保持法律之執行。以期减少及防止私運汽油。偷漏稅捐。故其最大之希望各爲州間互通消息對於各州運輸之汽油。如有出口過州等事。均互相知照。以便查核。會議席間擬計劃各州間如便用最　　最完全之方法。報告汽油之出口或進口。俾雙方能各自證實。是否與所報告者完全相符。此外則擬劃一各州間之汽油稅法律。及與聯邦政府互相合作等項。</p>
<p>據葛氏稱。近年以來各州間之互通消息。辦理已有成效。惟港岸及可以航行之水道等處。稍威困難。出席之九州對於合作之事。較之他州更見接近云云。目下汽油業之各公司由美国汽油實業　員會及州汽油委員會之助。已在着手徴稅。各委員會均派有調查員及查賬員四出實地調查。得有材料卽往報各州當局。</p>
<p>各州對於報告消息一節。亦擬定一劃一辦法。如是則各州當局卽能確知運輸之日期及地點。此外如數量·承托運人貨品細目·車輛號數及字母·油櫃車主及駕人姓名·州發執照號碼·及公　　上爲馬迪汽車</p>
<p>公司經理之氣</p>
<p>流式克雷斯勒</p>
<p>汽車。第一批</p>
<p>將於本星期内到申。</p>
<p>家服務之證明等。現在紐約及本薛文尼亞兩州當局已令油櫃運輸車之駕駛者必須執有單據。列有各種上述之詳情。及已付油稅之證明。但欲求此事之實行。廻非易事。其故一·因車輛來往過多。二·因地區遼闊。執是之故欲求實行。必須費去甚多之經費也。</p>
<p>按美国汽油學院統計。參予會議之九州。於一九三二年四·一九六·九八九·七二○加倫之汽油上。徴稅美金一二九·三八一·七○二元。漏稅之確數雖不得而知。但若以百分之十而計。每加倫稅洋三分。則已數其超過美金一·二五九·○九六元。而實際上州及聯邦之平均稅率爲四分半金洋。故其損失每年不下美金二·○○○·○○○元也。　　因兩州間徴稅之不同。漏稅之事乃更增多。譬如兩州爲鄰。一州徴稅二分。他州徴稅四分。則私販卽在徴稅二分之地。購買汽油後運往徴稅四分之地銷售。於是淨得其二分稅捐之贏餘。依照州定法律。凡在各州購買汽油。可以「</p>
<p>免稅出口」。故譬如在紐裘賽購得汽油。運往紐約用者。可以不須付稅於紐裘賽。蓋假定以稅付之紐約故也。尙有一班私販則在免稅各州購得汽油。然後私運到他州發售。卽不申報。更不付稅。故在紐約州常有運輸坦克及鐵路坦克車將汽油輸入。九州會議中之八州均有此同様之困難。惟浮蒙脫因無海岸。情形略異。亦有一種偷稅之徒。在本薛文尼亞或紐約購入汽油。假出口之名免付捐稅。但若輩裝運後。又復運回至原處免稅銷售。因此紐約及本薛文尼亞當局。對於巡港查稅。甚爲積極也。</p>
<p>私販等因各港口巡查嚴密。乃又别出心裁。以欺罔之方法矇蔽當局。其法乃購得汽油後。依法付稅裝運入州。譬如私販所購之汽油爲八：：○○○加倫。照章付稅每加倫爲洋三分。共洋二百四十元。然後以次等之煤油三、○○○加倫混入。於是一轉瞬間該販卽有一一。○○○加倫之汽油售諸市上矣。尙有一種方法爲假設一工廠。藉工業用之名義購入汽油。而後轉入私販之手。</p>
<p>參加葛萊和氏所召集會議之九州。某所有之汽車總數約佔全美四分之一。其所銷耗之汽油則佔全美總數三分之一　其所付之汽油稅及車輛註　　等約各爲四分之一。因此之故。如此九州對於私販下一攻擊。則国庫收入　可裕。及有關他州之利益。　匪淺鮮也。</p>

<h3>Smuggling of Salt from Puppet Territory Impacts Lu Salt Greatly</h3>

<h3>Anti-Bandit Armies on All Fronts Making Extremely Smooth Progress</h3>

The bandits choose military instructors who are not intellectuals, but only those who are not afraid of death and know how to kill. The bandits only practice chopping with knives, stabbing with spears, climbing mountains, walking at night, and throwing grenades, without any special skills. In the past, they were only accustomed to taking advantage of our weaknesses to launch night attacks, but now, because it is not easy to attack fortified positions, they have switched to mobile warfare, short-range surprise attacks, and charges. The bandits only have two meals a day, and the wounded bandits are left to die. Because the bandit areas are shrinking day by day, they have reorganized the puppet guerrilla teams into independent battalions and regiments, and the division bandits still use the three-three system. In the past, there were two radios to communicate with the puppet central government, but now they have all been destroyed. The bandits hiding in the mountains are all thinking of surrendering.

<h3>Reflections on Reading the Declaration of the National Financial Conference</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The Second National Financial Conference concluded on the 27th of this month. Before the closing, a declaration was issued to the people of the country. The declaration first stated the main points of the resolutions, divided into six categories: reducing taxes and assisting farmers, abolishing extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies, reforming the tax system, determining local financial budgets, focusing on production and construction, and implementing internal and external mutual assistance. Secondly, it focused on the relationship between urban and rural areas, advocating that national military and political authorities and financial circles find ways to utilize urban idle funds in order to alleviate the decline of rural areas. Looking at the entire declaration, it is possible to glimpse the crux of today's national economic crisis. However, when examining the purpose of this conference, it is necessary to see how it can be put into practice. As the declaration indicated, it still hopes that "the gentlemen of our country will be of one heart and one mind." This refers to the desire for thousands of people in the country to engage in psychological transformation. Given the sincerity of its arguments, we cannot criticize it. However, we still feel that this kind of advice should be directed specifically at warlords, bureaucrats, local bullies, and corrupt gentry. For the innocent common people who hear it, it will only increase their bitter laughter.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the national economic crisis. The decline of rural areas is the main cause of today's economic crisis. Everyone knows this. The government has repeatedly announced the revitalization of rural areas, but the trend of rural decline continues. There is no other way to save them. The solution has not yet addressed the core of the problem. The financial conference's declaration revealed the guidelines for saving rural areas, and the most noteworthy is the promotion of financial circles using urban idle funds to adjust rural finance. However, it is doubtful whether this will actually provide much assistance. If we review the reasons for the flow of rural capital to cities in recent years, we will know that it is not easy to guide urban idle funds back to the countryside. The crux of today's rural decline lies not in natural disasters but in man-made disasters. Ordinary farmers suffer all kinds of illegal exploitation, which not only makes them unaware of the joys of life but also unaware of where they will die. The misery displayed before our eyes is bankruptcy for the farmers themselves and the flight of capital for rural areas. If this is the status quo, even if there are members of the financial community who are as compassionate as one's own siblings and are willing to "be of one heart and one mind" to engage in the adjustment of rural finance, they will ultimately be constrained by reality. At most, it will only provide a glimmer of comfort to the farmers, and it will still be unavoidable to sigh that they can't do anything to help the farmers' real suffering. Isn't this kind of action similar to "treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause?"</p>
<p>We deeply feel that if we want to save the entire Chinese countryside today, we must start with politics. All the warlords, bureaucrats, local bullies, and corrupt gentry must not be allowed to act arbitrarily and exploit to their heart's content. As for the central officials, they should be fair, honest, and set an example. They should persuade people with virtue and control their subordinates with prestige, reward good deeds, punish wrongdoers, make clear what is shameful, and enforce strict punishments. If they do this for several years, there should be noticeable results. Otherwise, if they avoid addressing the core of the problem and focus solely on the branches, hoping to transform the psychology of the people in the country as the foundation for material transformation, then I am afraid that the situation will be difficult to improve. The results of the Second Financial Conference will be seen after the resolutions are implemented. The government authorities know how to make efforts in this direction.</p>

<h3>Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Submits Opinions on the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission previously received a draft of the Constitution prepared by the Legislative Yuan from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, requesting the Commission to study, sign, and submit its opinions to the Executive Yuan for review. The Commission submitted the following opinions: Except for the Khalkha, Kobdo, and Tannu Uriankhai leagues and regions of Outer Mongolia, the regions of Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang have all been designated as provincial jurisdictions. Among them, with the exception of the ten tribes of the Xilin Gol League, county governments have been established. However, the organization of the Mongolian leagues and banners is still managed as before, and the Mongolian people under their jurisdiction do not cease to exist because provinces and counties exist. The National Government previously promulgated the Law on the Organization of Mongolian Leagues and Banners and recently promulgated eight principles for Mongolian autonomy, establishing the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee. All original League Chief Offices were renamed League Governments, and Banner Jasagh Offices were renamed Banner Governments. Regions that originally did not have a League Chief were also renamed League and League Governments were established. The actual issue of League jurisdiction – when the National Assembly drafted the Provisional Constitution last time, the Mongolian representatives argued that Article 81 of the original draft stipulated that the systems of the Mongolian and Tibetan regions where provinces had not been established would be determined by law. As a result of vigorous efforts, the words “(where provinces had not been established)” were deleted, and it was changed to the systems of the Mongolian and Tibetan regions would be determined by law. (5) Article 138 of the draft Constitution also stipulates that for regions that have not been established as provinces, their political systems shall be determined by law. The leagues and banners within the regions that have already been established as provinces have no status in the Constitution, but in fact, they must exist. In order for the Constitution to take effect and maintain its dignity, it is necessary to amend the draft Constitution. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Eschew Empty Talk, Devote to Practicality, Salvage the Fate of the Disarmament Conference; General Commission Meets in an Atmosphere of Tension; US and Russian Representatives Clarify Positions; Litvinov Suggests Expanding the Scope of the Conference; Rename it the Peace Conference with the Aim of Eliminating War; Davis Declares Willingness to Work to Promote the Convention; Advocating Arms Control to Prevent War</h3>
<p>Reiterates Non-Interference in European Political Disputes</p>
<p>But Concern for Far Eastern Affairs is Implied</p>
<p>(Geneva) First-class diplomats from 64 countries on five continents, including 14 foreign ministers, met here at 3:45 this afternoon to decide the fate of global disarmament. Handerson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, announced the opening of the General Commission, stating, "At this critical moment, it is time to decide how to act in the future." The visitor stands were packed. The atmosphere in the meeting place was serious and apprehensive, as if awaiting a verdict. The press box was unprecedentedly crowded. Special correspondents from various countries held their pens, ready to write the final chapter of the actual attempt at disarmament, so as not to produce materials for empty talk again.</p>
<p>Throughout the morning, in hotels, cafes, and League of Nations lounges, diplomats from various countries were seen in small groups, preparing for the final effort to decide whether to dissolve the Disarmament Conference or continue the previous fruitless negotiations.</p>
<h3>Handerson Delivers Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>In his opening remarks, Handerson stated that since the opening of the conference, the situation has deteriorated, and despite repeated efforts by many countries, complex negotiations between various governments have failed as before. Handerson, therefore, urged a rapid solution to the following three issues: (1) land armaments, (2) air force convention, and (3) international control of the manufacture and sale of arms. A land armament agreement is urgently needed, as national security depends on it. Moreover, this issue is the key to the entire disarmament issue. Concluding an air force convention is the only step to prevent violence against innocent civilians in wartime, and its resolution is self-evident. As for the issue of international arms embargo, Handerson cited the Chaco War to demonstrate its urgency.</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Suggestion</h3>
<p>Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov then followed with a surprising move. Litvinov suggested that the Disarmament Conference be renamed the Peace Conference, to meet regularly to discuss various important issues for eliminating war. Disarmament, of course, can also be a question for discussion, as this would expand the scope of the conference and allow it to pursue various avenues of reconciliation to achieve practical results.</p>
<h3>US Representative Declares Position</h3>
<p>US Special Envoy Davis then made a powerful statement to save the Disarmament Conference from collapse. He stated that the United States is willing to reduce naval tonnage in order to prevent a naval arms race before the 1935 naval disarmament conference. Davis stated, "We are willing to engage with relevant countries in a substantial and proportionate reduction of tonnage." The US Special Envoy further predicted the possibility of Germany's return to the League of Nations in the near future. (National telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference, in other words, the plenary session, reconvened in a pessimistic atmosphere at 3:40 this afternoon after a long recess. The representatives present included foreign affairs officials from fourteen countries. Before the meeting, several major powers apparently did not believe that this meeting would have any constructive effect. Chairman Handerson delivered a lengthy speech, urging the representatives not to sacrifice more than two years of work and stressing the need for a collective guarantee from countries supporting disarmament worldwide. US Representative Davis briefly outlined the US government's attitude and policies, saying that the United States is prepared to cooperate in various practicable ways in efforts to seek a general disarmament convention. The United States is prepared to negotiate a general non-aggression pact and consult with other countries on international issues arising from any treaty to which the United States is a party. The United States does not wish to be involved in any European political negotiations and resolutions, nor does it wish to assume any obligations or use its military force to resolve any disputes. In other words, the US policy is to avoid war but to assist in eliminating and preventing war in every possible way. Davis also said that the United States is willing to establish an effective system for managing the manufacture and trade of arms through international agreement, and said, "We should return to the final stage of negotiations in June 8th of last year when all countries accepted the draft proposed by the United Kingdom as the basis for future conventions. It is at this stage that there is hope of establishing a general agreement." Germany presumably wants a disarmament convention. If so, I dare not believe that Germany is unwilling to reopen negotiations based on the previously agreed basis. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Declares France Expresses Approval</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Chairman Handerson of the Disarmament Conference strongly advocated that the General Commission should continue its efforts to conclude a convention. French Foreign Minister Barthou also enthusiastically supported the continuation of the conference. Handerson proposed at a caucus meeting this afternoon that the speeches given by the members of the General Commission at 1:30 PM tomorrow should be broadcast by radio, which was approved by the meeting. It is expected that the first speakers will be US Representative to the Disarmament Conference Davis and Russian Representative Litvinov. It is heard that Litvinov has abandoned his plan to present a concrete plan for mutual assistance agreement and only intends to touch upon it in his speech. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Renamed Security to Conceal Failure</h3>
<p>(London) It is rumored that the Disarmament Conference will be renamed the Security Conference to conceal the signs of disarmament failure. The Daily Telegraph commented that this plan is merely an attempt by some countries to unite against Japan and Germany, and the United Kingdom cannot agree to it. The United States will probably maintain its neutral position and not be bound by any restrictions. Not only that, but the final form of disarmament may be completely eliminated, and the arms race will continue indefinitely. Therefore, if the UK participates in this top meeting, it will have a hundred disadvantages and not a single advantage. Furthermore, Mussolini's recent speech shows that he, who once enthusiastically supported the Disarmament Conference, now also admits that the good opportunity has been lost and cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>(National telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Disarmament Exists in Name Only</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, 64 country representatives, including 14 foreign ministers and US Special Envoy Davis, are participating in the Disarmament Conference. It is heard that in order to save face, it is planned to appoint a "Security Committee" to proceed at a later date. This afternoon, representatives from 13 countries held a preparatory meeting to prepare for the opening of the caucus meeting tomorrow. Chairman Handerson reported on the development of disarmament negotiations since March of this year. Observers believe that because all countries hold their own opinions, they are pessimistic about the future. France advocates that disarmament affairs should still be handled by the League of Nations Executive Council, and that the League of Nations Executive Council should appoint another committee composed of representatives from major powers and invite the US and Russia to participate. The new committee would redraft the disarmament plan, based on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement, and realize France's security doctrine, while the real disarmament issue would be ignored. Chairman Handerson still advocates maintaining the Five-Power Agreement of December 1932 to enable Germany to return to Geneva. The agreement has recognized Germany's equality in armaments. However, the representatives of various countries are paying close attention to Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, because his position at this meeting is different from the others. (National telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>French Policy is Eyed with Suspicion</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French press has already admitted that France's position in Geneva is unfavorable. Foreign Minister Barthou is eyed with suspicion and is even more embarrassing. There is even more criticism of Simon's and Handerson's persistent attempts to get Germany to return to the League of Nations. Moreover, the outside world wants to blame France for the breakdown of disarmament, which makes the newspapers here express their dissatisfaction. Some newspapers also reported that Foreign Minister Barthou had several open conflicts with Foreign Minister Simon during their talks yesterday. Therefore, the future of France's struggle is still unknown. (National telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The Geneva special telegrams published in the British newspapers have revealed the chaotic situation in Geneva. The opinions of France and Britain on the disarmament issue are becoming increasingly conflicting. The London Times reported that the British delegation was disappointed by Foreign Minister Barthou's speech, which lacked constructive proposals. (National telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Delegation Arrives in Geneva</h3>
<p>Marseilles The Japanese representatives to the Disarmament Conference, Iwanaga, Kikukawa, Taka藤, and others, arrived here by ship this morning and will leave for Geneva immediately to attend the Disarmament Conference. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>To Cope with the Far Eastern Crisis; Russia First Seeks Security in the West; Litvinov's Purpose in Acting in Geneva</h3>
<p>Geneva News: It is reported that the urgent arrival of Russian Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov in the local area is due to the impending crisis in the Far East, and he is considering countermeasures. Before going to France, Mr. Li said to the French Foreign Minister, "If an incident occurs unavoidably, then in order to consolidate Russia's eastern border, it is urgent to ensure that there are no concerns on the western border." Mr. Li also stated elsewhere that the Russian government now believes that Japan and Germany are preparing for war. Therefore, the participating countries in the Disarmament Conference must quickly discuss the "Treaty Defining Aggressor" proposed by the Russian government and conclude "regional mutual assistance treaties." In addition, because the Russian government will join the League of Nations, it first visited the Romanian Foreign Minister to discuss the issue of the League of Nations recognizing Soviet Russia. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>Striving for Peace; France and Russia Share Views; Russia's Entry into the League of Nations is Passive, Not Active</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia"</p>
<p>In its lead article titled "Franco-Soviet Friendship and Peace as Causes"</p>
<p>The article stated, "Soviet public opinion welcomes the speech of French Foreign Minister Barthou. The member countries of the European League of Nations are mostly concerned about peace, and France's policy is to use this concern to make the League of Nations a more effective tool for guaranteeing peace than before. Therefore, if we have already understood the substantial assistance given by the Soviet government to all peace proposals, then we will recognize the positive efforts of the French policy to forge the internal struggle for peace in the League of Nations and the similar struggle implemented by the Soviet Union into one. This cannot be considered unusual. Some member countries of the League of Nations proposed to invite the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations in order to strengthen the League of Nations' struggle for peace and form a united front in the struggle against war. Barthou declared in the French Parliament that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations would be an important event for European peace. This friendly proposal is not only based on the Soviet Union's peace policy but also based on the fact that the Soviet representatives themselves recognize the arguments made by those who are concerned about peace and support the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations (as expressed by Barthou regarding his negotiations with Litvinov in Geneva) are being given serious consideration. This move was not initiated by the Soviet government, as some newspapers have mistakenly reported. In fact, the Soviet government only expressed its approval or disapproval of the proposals of other countries in this move. (Tass dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan is Willing to Participate in the London Naval Disarmament Preparatory Conference; Advocating Separate Negotiations Among the Major Powers; Absolutely Rejecting Discussions on the Far Eastern Issue; Official Reply to the UK Has Been Issued</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's attitude towards the preparatory naval disarmament conference has been decided by today's cabinet meeting, and an immediate telegram has been sent to Ambassador Matsudaira with an official reply to the UK, the content of which is as follows: (1) After careful consideration, the Japanese government has decided to participate in the preparatory conference with pleasure. (2) The form of the preparatory conference must be a strict preparatory negotiation, and the two countries' diplomatic agencies will hold free talks in London. (3) Political issues other than naval issues are not the purpose of this conference, and we do not wish to discuss such issues. (4) All policies of the Japanese representatives in the preparatory conference must obtain the consent of the Japanese government. Therefore, the questions and answers on important issues cannot be freely issued by the Japanese representatives and must be reserved each time pending instructions from the Japanese government. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The opening date of the official naval disarmament conference will depend on the decision of the preparatory conference. However, according to information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the UK and the US, the UK and the US hope to hold the conference in February or March of next year. From this perspective, the preparatory conference seems likely to hold negotiations at an early date. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the preparatory naval disarmament conference will open and an official conference will be held in February of next year, the naval authorities have decided to expand the disarmament countermeasures committee and plan to appoint Rear Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, the current commander of the 1st Air Fleet, as chairman, and will issue a formal order on June 1st. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official sources today, Japanese Ambassador to the US Saito suggested to Secretary of State Hull on Saturday and Sunday that the US and Japan should hold diplomatic talks before the 1935 naval conference. It is heard that Hull expressed disagreement with this suggestion. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Wu Lien-teh Discusses Attending the League of Nations; Progress in China's Health Undertakings; Earns a Good Impression from All Parties</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese epidemic prevention expert Dr. Wu Lien-teh is currently touring London and spoke to a Reuter's News Agency reporter today about his experience in Geneva. He stated that he spoke for one and a half hours at the League of Nations Health Committee, and the committee members praised the progress of China's health undertakings. He felt deeply gratified. Dr. Wu specifically mentioned that the National Economic Council's recruitment of Chinese experts for public service has been very beneficial. This was something that could only be achieved through political lobbying in the past. Dr. Wu also said that placing Chinese in Western groups and giving them practical experience is very important. Now, the British Boxer Indemnity refund can be used to achieve this goal. He then mentioned the report of Rajchman, saying that it has had a very good impression in Geneva. He believes that Rajchman will return to China, but the League of Nations must first confirm him as the director of the League of Nations Health Section. Dr. Wu is currently staying at his alma mater, Emmanuel College, and said that Principal Giles is still in good spirits despite being 88 years old. Dr. Wu is now seeking to purchase the Chinese books collected by Professor Giles and the late Sir Cantlie for the Chinese Medical Association. Dr. Wu is scheduled to return to China on June 8 to prepare for the Far Eastern Union of Tropical Medicine Conference to be held in Nanjing in October. This is the first time the conference will be held in China. Dr. Wu said, "We have nothing to be ashamed of now. We can show everything to others." (Reuter's News Agency special dispatch, 28th)</p>

If so, China and Japan will be able to get along well. (China United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Famous French Aviator's Unsuccessful Paris-to-San Francisco Flight: Safely Crosses the Atlantic in Thirty-Eight Hours, Lands in New York Due to Engine Trouble</h3>
<p>(New York) Rossi and Codos' record-breaking long-distance straight flight, after crossing the Atlantic, had entered its most dangerous phase. Unfortunately, due to engine trouble, they were forced to land at Benna Square at 1:37 PM today. The two aviators seemed poised to break the record after flying out of the dense fog over the coast of Newfoundland, but the engine trouble at this moment is deeply regrettable. The Boston Naval Shipyard first received a brief telegram reporting that the two aviators had encountered mechanical problems and were unable to break the record of 5,653 and a quarter miles from last summer. The report was too brief to be believed. Just as they were about to try to communicate with Rossi and Codos by radio, the plane suddenly appeared over the airfield, circled the field once, released 3,000 liters of gasoline, and then landed at the airfield. Rossi was the first to exit the plane, smiling and expressing his gratitude to the airfield officials and workers who assisted them. Codos seemed slightly uneasy when leaving the plane, but soon recovered. Both aviators were saddened by their failure to complete the feat of flying directly to San Francisco. Rossi said, "The trip was very interesting. When we flew across the Atlantic, except for the dense fog over the coast of Newfoundland, the journey was quite smooth." Although the two aviators failed to break the previous record, their second crossing of the treacherous North Atlantic was indeed remarkable. This crossing of the Atlantic took 38 hours and 27 minutes, slower than Costes and Bellonte's record of 37 hours and 17 minutes. When the two aviators landed, the crowd waiting at the airfield warmly welcomed them. New York City is also preparing a welcome according to past practice. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) French aviators Codos and Rossi, after flying across the Atlantic, safely landed at the Flobenet airfield near here at 6:38 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time hereinafter). Although their attempt to break the world record for long-distance flight has failed, they have completed the flight between Paris and New York. Prior to this, only the French aviators Costes and Bellonte had done so in 1930. The plane flown by Codos and Rossi this time was built three years ago, making their achievement even more astonishing. According to reports, the two took off at 5:10 AM yesterday, and the entire journey took 38 hours and 22 minutes (in 1930, Costes and Bellonte took 37 hours and 18 minutes, and in 1927, U.S. Colonel Lindbergh flew from the U.S. to France in 33 hours and 29 minutes). (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) French aviators Rossi and Codos landed today in North Truro, Massachusetts, USA, failing to break their own record of 5,653 and a half miles for non-stop flight. However, they have achieved a new record for rapid crossing of the Atlantic. On the way, they sent a wireless message to a Massachusetts radio station, informing them that the plane's engine was slightly damaged and that they intended to repair it in the air. If it could not be repaired, they planned to land in Brooklyn, New York. The sudden landing in Massachusetts was probably due to engine damage. Rossi and Codos originally planned to go directly to San Diego, California, and then fly back to France, following the route taken by Lindbergh eight years ago. The flight from Paris to New York covered a total of 3,280 miles and took 36 hours and 28 minutes, which can be described as incredibly fast. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters dispatch from Natal, Brazil, another French aviator named Mailloux, flying across the South Atlantic, arrived in Natal at 7 PM tonight. His starting point was Saint-Louis in French West Africa's Senegal. This flight received official assistance, as it aimed to establish a commercial air route between France and South America, but France will only officially recognize it after three round trips.

<h3>Roosevelt Orders Embargo on Bolivian and Paraguayan Arms: Hopes for Unified Action by All Nations, Only Japan Not Invited to Join</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today issued an order declaring an arms embargo on Bolivia and Paraguay to stop the Chaco War. Congress has passed the bill, but stipulates that the President has the right to amend the ban. Two days ago, the President hinted to the Associated Press that he did not want to wait for League of Nations cooperation and would take unilateral action immediately. It is believed that the U.S. embargo may not be able to stop the Chaco War, but it is enough to clear the U.S. of the stigma of aiding the war. Now that the U.S. has taken the lead, other countries may soon join the international embargo movement. It is said that both Bolivia and Paraguay have long prepared for an international embargo and have accumulated a large amount of arms. (National News Agency Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the League of Nations Council passed British representative Eden's proposal on the 19th of this month to ban the sale of arms to the South American countries of Bolivia and Paraguay and telegraphed 31 governments to inquire whether they were willing to participate in this arms embargo movement, official circles here have been paying close attention to how the various countries will respond, and are particularly concerned about the responses of South America and the countries neighboring the two belligerent nations. Some people are discussing why Japan was not invited to join the embargo movement. According to general observation, this is probably because it is feared that if Japan refuses, it would damage the League of Nations' reputation, so the League of Nations specifically excluded it. Recalling the time in 1931, former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson invited Japan to join the U.S., France, Britain, Italy, Germany and other countries in imposing sanctions on Bolivia and Paraguay. However, the then Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Debuchi, replied to Stimson, "The Bolivia-Paraguay conflict has nothing to do with Japan, so Japan cannot speak out and can hardly take any action." The old story is brought up again, and it is impossible not to consider that Japan may take this approach again. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>

Soon, a company will be established to handle the long-distance transportation of Saar gas. The German government is actually helping the Saar region, and this is its first evidence.

<h3>Japan Covets Dutch and Portuguese Islands in the South Seas: Repeatedly Considers Buying Them, But is Rejected by Portugal</h3>
<p>Lisbon East of Java and north of Australia in the South Seas, there is an island named Timor, the western half of which belongs to the Dutch and the eastern half of which belongs to the Portuguese. Previously, there was talk that Japan intended to buy it from Portugal, which was then denied by Portugal. Subsequently, the London Sunday Express reported that the British government was discussing buying it, and it was rumored that the purchase price was between 5 million and 10 million pounds. The island owners, the Netherlands and Portugal, also seemed willing to sell. This statement was also denied by the British and Dutch governments. This was in March of this year. Now, after several months, the Portuguese Minister of Colonial Affairs issued a statement to a British newspaper, saying that it was rumored that Japan had paid certain amounts to the Portuguese government, intending to buy Portuguese Timor. After investigation, this request did not actually happen, and the whole world knows that anyone who intends to buy an inch of Portuguese territory, the Portuguese government can only reject it. According to a telegram from Amsterdam, Netherlands, on March 11, the United Kingdom is currently discussing with the Netherlands the establishment of an airfield on the island in order to expand air mail services between British India and Australia. From the words of the Portuguese Minister of Colonial Affairs, it can be seen that Japan's intention to covet it has not diminished. (Havas Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Cuba's Independent and Autonomous Movement Against the United States</h3>
<p>Havana The Cuban government today strongly condemned the followers of former President Machado for firing shots at the U.S. Embassy yesterday. Finance Minister Saénz especially criticized them, saying that they are now trying to alienate the relationship between the United States and Cuba. It is now learned that the Cuban cabinet is considering abolishing the Platt Amendment in the Cuban Constitution. This clause gives the United States the power to use force to intervene in Cuba to maintain order. According to Education Minister Mañach, if there were no such clause, this unfortunate incident would not have occurred. These words can represent the national sentiment of Cuba. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The shooting outside the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Caffery, in Havana yesterday has been reported here, and it is believed that the incident has come to an end.

Cuban President Mendieta has a good relationship with the U.S. and will not be affected by this incident. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<h3>Danzig Authorities Dissolve Communist Party Organizations</h3>
<p>Danzig The Danzig police authorities today ordered the dissolution of the Danzig Communist Party and its affiliated organizations. The Danzig municipal power is controlled by the Nazi Party, whose leader is Danzig Senate Speaker Rauschning. All organizations such as the "Red Front Fighters," "Red Navy," "Red Youth Front," and "Red Women's Association" are affected by this order. The Danzig authorities dissolved the Communist Party under the pretext of maintaining public order, claiming that the Communist Party's active propaganda endangers Danzig's security. It is also alleged that Communist Party leaders supplied weapons to Communist Party members in preparation for resisting government orders and distributed leaflets instigating the public to resist the administration. However, the seven Communist Party members in the Danzig City Council are not affected by the order to dissolve the Communist Party, as they are protected by the Danzig City Constitution, which is guaranteed by the League of Nations. It is currently undecided whether the League of Nations Management Committee recognizes this measure by the authorities as legal. It is expected that they will require the Nazi Party authorities to provide concrete evidence of the Communist Party's illegal activities, but this kind of evidence may not be easy to find.

<h3>US Demands War Debt from Britain: Britain Still Willing to Pay Part if Not Treated as a Debtor</h3>
<p>(London) The United States today sent a bill to Britain, asking for the payment of war debt of $239,111,000, including two war debts due in 1933, one for $66 million and one for $88 million, plus $9,721,000 for the half-year war debt allowed to be deferred by President Hoover in 1931 and 1932, and the half-year war debt of $75,390,000 due on June 15 this year. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>London Regarding the war debt due on June 15, it is expected that Britain will still be able to pay a part of it to show its sincerity, but only if the responsible U.S. side publicly declares and acknowledges that Britain's actions are a sign of fulfilling its debt. The reason for this is that every time the war debt is due, Britain always pays a part of it to show that it is not defaulting on the debt. Unexpectedly, the U.S. Johnson Act treats Britain the same as other countries that do not pay their debts at all. If the U.S. authorities can issue the above statement this time, then the impact of the Johnson Act on Britain can be compensated for in spirit. Conversely, if the U.S. is unwilling to do this, then the British Parliament may find it difficult to approve the government to continue to pay a part of the war debt according to the previous method. Therefore, British people are eagerly awaiting President Roosevelt's statement on the war debt issue. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Meets</h3>
<p>(London) The British House of Commons resumed its meeting today after the Pentecost holiday. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated that he was not yet able to comment on the matter of debt owed to the United States, but hoped to report the details soon. A Member of Parliament asked whether the government intended to form a committee to prepare for the 25th anniversary celebrations of the British monarch's ascension to the throne in Britain and the Dominions. Prime Minister MacDonald replied that this matter was under consideration and would be announced soon. Dominions Secretary Thomas mentioned that the Finance Minister of the Irish Free State had said that if Britain and Ireland had a good relationship, then South Ireland could offer many things to Britain, saying that he welcomed this moderate tone, but unfortunately, the statements made by South Ireland's main people after this did not seem to confirm this optimism. However, if a satisfactory basis for discussion can be obtained, then Britain is prepared to negotiate with the Free State at any time in order to resolve various outstanding issues. Although South Ireland has various provocative words and deeds, the British government has never closed the door to negotiations. A Member of Parliament suggested that Britain initiate negotiations, and Thomas replied that he welcomed the statement of the South Irish Finance Minister and hoped that negotiations could begin from this point, but within a week, de Valera suddenly said, "We will never pay." Since he said this, what is the point of the British government initiating it? Labour Member of Parliament Wedgwood asked whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer had considered his suggestion for repaying the debt owed to the United States. The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that he had considered it but felt that the disadvantages outweighed the advantages. Wedgwood later told a Reuters reporter that he suggested that the British government cooperate with the U.S. government to purchase surplus U.S. wheat or cotton and resell it to China or India, and receive their long-term bonds to offset the payment for the goods, plus a levy of 1.05%. In order to facilitate Britain's repayment of debt, the United States should give special convenience to goods supplied to the United States by the British Empire, such as rubber and manufactured goods. In this way, both sides can obtain common benefits in controlling surplus raw materials and controlling China. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>San Francisco Labor Strike: Workers Clash with Police Again</h3>
<p>San Francisco San Francisco has once again become a battlefield for dockworkers and sailors clashing with police today. The battle line extended for three miles. The police hoped to disperse the protesters with batons, but gunshots could be heard occasionally. A passerby was hit by a stray bullet and seriously injured in the back. Striking workers claimed that the bullet was fired by the police, but the police denied firing and claimed that armed workers were hiding in nearby houses, specializing in shooting police officers. At the same time, federal mediators, representatives of striking workers, and company personnel are expected to receive a compromise solution today so that they can discuss it at separate meetings tomorrow.

<h3>Japanese Sugar Dumping Becomes More Severe: Ministry of Industry Plans Measures to Protect National Sugar</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In recent years, foreign sugar has been dumping at reduced prices, with British Taikoo Sugar and Japanese Daikoku Sugar being the most prevalent. Recently, Japanese sugar dumping has become even more severe. Almost all the sugar in the country is Japanese sugar. Every year, tens of millions of bags are imported into our country. Each bag weighs about 120 catties and is worth fifteen or sixteen taels of silver. The annual loss is worrisome. Japanese sugar is white and quite light in color, while our domestically produced sugar is slightly yellow. Generally fashionable people consider the white sugar to be scientifically hygienic. As a result, domestic sugar cannot be sold well. The Ministry of Industry is planning measures to protect domestic sugar in order to save the situation, but it is not easy to recall and reorganize the sugar merchants from Guangdong and Hainan who have changed industries.

<h3>Salt Affairs Administration Thoroughly Investigates the Truth of Salt Poisoning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The person in charge of the Salt Affairs Administration said that the salt poisoning case among the citizens of Beijing has been investigated and it has been determined that the salt in question was produced in the Huainan salt pans. Although its color is not as white as the salt from Huaibei and Changlu, the compound of the salt itself definitely does not contain any toxic substances. Salt poisoning must undoubtedly be due to a mixture. The previous publication of the investigation results by this Administration, saying that there is no poison in the salt, referred to the compound. Readers did not understand this and misunderstood that this Administration fundamentally denied that there was any poison in the salt. This must be explained in detail. Chemical tests have shown that the toxic substance mixed in the salt this time is Chilean nitrate. However, the price of nitrate is very high, and merchants with profit-seeking intentions would definitely not be willing to mix it in because the cost of substitutes is more expensive than salt. In order to clarify the source of this Chilean nitrate, this Administration has jointly ordered Zhou Zonghua, the Deputy Transportation Commissioner of Huainan, to send officers to Beijing to conduct a thorough investigation together with the Health Bureau to clarify the truth.

<h3>German Newspaper Discusses Japan's Policy Towards China; Japan Exploits Opportunities to Invade China; Actions Toward China Help the Rampancy of Communist Bandits; Occupation of the Eastern Provinces Affects Chinese Trade; All Countries Forbid Japan from Monopolizing the Market</h3>
<p>The Deutsche Tageszeitung's editorial on May 3rd, titled "Japan's Policy Towards China," stated briefly: Japan's policy towards China is nothing more than a barometer of the political situation in Europe and America. Japan's peaceful sounds or war threats to Nanjing or Moscow are entirely determined by the tension or relaxation of the political and economic situation in Europe and America. This situation of taking care of both the East and West lines is repeatedly and accurately proven by past events. Recently, France's April 17th note on the disarmament conference led the European peace to a dead end, and today's declaration by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to make China a protectorate of Japan. Diplomacy is like a chess game, all about taking advantage of opportunities. Tokyo's declaration is nothing more than advising European governments to maintain order in their own countries first, and then to consider the interests of the Far East. Japan's Far East policy after the war is to take advantage of the internal divisions in Europe and China. The inconsistency of opinions among major Chinese politicians is indeed a major obstacle to development. However, constant foreign aggression and the constraints of unequal treaties are sufficient to hinder the Chinese revolution. Especially Japan, whenever there is a slight possibility of Chinese unification, it continues to attack. Past events, such as the establishment of the National Government in 1927, saw the Tanaka Cabinet pursuing an aggressive policy towards China. The dispatch of troops to Jinan was to obstruct the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army. The assassination of Zhang Zuolin, on the contrary, facilitated the change of flags in Manchuria. Unfortunately, it still caused the loss of the Eastern Provinces and the division of the country. Recently, due to the resolution of the Fujian issue, Nanjing and Guangdong seemed to be able to cooperate. Japan has gone a step further and wants to make China its protectorate. In fact, the conflict between Guangdong and Nanjing, apart from personal relationships, is entirely due to the issue with Japan. Chiang Kai-shek, as a practical politician, knows that it is useless to actively confront Japan. At this time, he only pays attention to internal construction. Chiang's passive policy towards Japan is opposed by his counterparties. When Nanjing was in a precarious situation, Japan deliberately made things difficult for it to increase its burden. The recent cooperation between Chiang and Wang has been successful. Chen Jitang of Guangdong is also leaning towards the central government. In the precarious and critical situation of North China, Huang Fu is trying to seek understanding with the Japanese side. This is recognized by the Japanese. Song Ziwen, who bears the heavy burden of an international financier, is also striving to assist the Economic Commission's work. Chen Gongbo's four-year plan is entirely based on sound principles. The export of small industrial products from China in 1932 was 100 million marks. The Minister of Transportation Zhu Jia-hua and the Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu are able to do their best to seek the development of transportation enterprises in this difficult financial situation. The situation in China is not as chaotic as the Japanese government and public opinion claim. Japan likes to use the pretext of Chinese radicalization to cover up its policy towards China. However, judging from past facts, China is doing its best to oppose communism. Japan's actions towards China happen to help the rampancy of communist bandits. For example, when the Japanese army attacked Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek had no choice but to withdraw troops from areas where the Communist bandits were rampant, making the anti-communist effort fall short. After the Fujian rebellion was settled, Chiang again withdrew elite troops to Jiangxi to suppress the communists. It is reported that great results have been achieved. If the anti-communist issue is affected by diplomatic issues again, China will not be responsible. From the perspective of the Chinese situation, Japan's declaration of turning China into a protectorate is completely unreasonable. I still remember the report on commerce in Shanghai by British Consul Peel (Louis Beale) from 1931 to 1933. In his discussion of the Chinese situation, he said that if China no longer suffers from internal and external troubles, then China's revival can be expected. A prosperous China will surely be able to join the ranks of great powers, and at the same time, it can also promote the prosperity of the world economy. Regarding territorial ambitions towards China, except for Japan, the most is no more than Soviet Russia and France. Most other countries hope for peace in the Far East to seek commercial prosperity. Since 1922, China's international trade has continued to increase to 600 million marks. After 1932, it fell to 300 million marks. The loss of Manchuria caused China's international trade to decrease by more than 35 percent. The international capital world and other international economic circles regard China as a wonderful market. Of course, they do not want to witness the reduction of Chinese tax revenue, which affects China's financial strength, and makes China's import trade rely entirely on export trade to balance it. Japan's monopoly on the Chinese market is not only unbearable for China, but also not allowed by other countries. Japanese politicians and the press often criticize Western politics and civilization, especially Europe after the European War, and Western imperialism in Asia is criticized most strongly. In fact, Japan is still following the imperialism of the 19th century as the basis for its Asian policy. Japan has not been influenced by European culture, because Japan is good at seizing European civilization and industry, applying European economic methods, and creating a strong army and navy to join the ranks of great powers. Today, Japan's territory has far surpassed the Japanese Empire of that year. Its foreign trade covers Western countries. The governments and public opinion of all countries were surprised by Japan's declaration this time, because Japan's interests in China have not been damaged, and this action to undermine China's sovereignty is sufficient to affect the interests of other countries, and at the same time, it also destroys the international treaties signed by Japan.

<h3>Japan's Steps to Invade Mongolia; Using Empty Titles to Entice Mongolian Traitors; Hoping to Change the Color of the Northwest Within a Year; Actively Invading the Area North of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>A Beiping correspondent, quoting a certain police officer who escaped from the Northeast and came to Beiping, said that after the puppet Puyi usurped the throne, the Japanese planned to use the puppet's name to first ennoble Mongolian traitors with titles of kings and marquises to deceive them and incite them in Mongolia. The second step was to send troops to invade Mongolia on a large scale, with the goal of changing the color of the northwest within a year. The third step was to implement the southward invasion of Pingjin, attempting to turn the area north of the Yellow River into the territory of the puppet state of Manchukuo within two years. This conspiracy was originally decided internally by Japan when Puyi was instigated to usurp the throne. The people of the Northeast are waiting for an opportunity to eliminate the puppet organization. Therefore, the leaders of the 150,000-strong righteous army jointly sent a telegram stating: (1) To sabotage the enemy's institutions occupying the Northeast and guide the people to unanimously resist Japan. (2) To kill all 490 traitors, including Puyi and Zheng Xiaoxu. (3) To carry out joint resistance against Japan with friendly countries. The Japanese and puppets were very panicked. Therefore, after Puyi usurped the throne, he secretly followed the order of Ryo, to reorganize the puppet army. The original puppet army was renamed the puppet "Royalist Army," and a new Mongolian army was formed. A Mongolian military academy was established in Qiqihar to train military officers. The Mongolian army currently has a force of 2,000 people and plans to establish an independent headquarters, recruit young people from Inner and Outer Mongolia, and add two divisions to serve as the main force for invading Mongolia. Balingsai, a Mongolian military officer who studied in Japan, will be appointed as the commander of the Mongolian army. The puppet organization has divided the area around the Xing'an Mountains and eastern Mongolia into a Mongolian autonomous region, under the administration of the Xing'an Public Office. All officials will be Mongolian, and various preferential treatments will be given to the Mongolians in the area to entice them. Puyi issued an absurd edict in the name of the puppet emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo, saying that the puppet state of Manchukuo would use the Way of the King as the basis for governing the country and treat the five races "Manchu, Mongol, White Russian, Japanese, and Korean" equally. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese plan to use their puppets to invade Mongolia has now been materialized. On the one hand, they are also fabricating public opinion within the customs, requesting the restoration of the Qing Dynasty, and carrying out the process of entering the customs. They have sent royalist remnants south to various provinces to lobby, hiring ten people in each province to impersonate people's representatives to encourage advancement. They have already sent Zheng's son Xiaoxu and Li, a remnant of the royalist party, to Guangdong to collude with and persuade the surviving elders. The Japanese have also deliberately revealed their intentions slightly to test the international atmosphere. They once sent Araki Tadatsugu to Beiping to investigate the location of churches and other properties in Beiping. The Japanese army in Pingjin has also successively conducted exercises. Foreigners believe that the matter is of great importance. The Japanese conspiracy to use puppets to plot against us is evident. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Activities in Fujian: Investigation of Taiwanese Residents' Lives, Proposal for a Cross-Strait Conference, Dispatch of Personnel by the Japanese Consulate to Investigate Inland Economy, Secret Photography and Map Drawing Along the Coast, and Establishment of a Drug Organization by Japanese in Fuzhou City</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Recently, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office convened a Cross-Strait Conference of Japanese consuls from Fujian and Guangdong provinces, attracting the attention of the Chinese people. For a time, the situation in South China became tense. Although the Fuzhou Japanese Consulate and Japanese newspapers have vehemently denied that the conference had any political implications for South China, recent Japanese actions in Fujian have raised many suspicions. These are described in detail below: (1) Starting from the 21st of this month, the Japanese Consulate dispatched many Japanese police officers to the homes of Taiwanese residents in the city to investigate their names, ages, native places, addresses, number of family members, and the nature of their businesses. They also inquired in great detail about their monthly income and expenditure, their daily behavior, and their feelings about their place of residence. Particular attention was paid to their commercial and economic situations, such as where certain goods were shipped from, to whom they were sold, the purchase price, the selling price, the monthly sales volume, the profit margin, and the monthly rent, food expenses, and wages. All of this information was to be meticulously compiled into a register, which was to be taken to Taiwan by the Japanese Consul Usami to be presented at the Cross-Strait Conference to determine the overall immigration policy. (2) Recently, the Japanese Consulate, in order to investigate the economic situation and social conditions in various parts of Fujian, specifically dispatched more than ten staff members and overseas merchants, including Nakayama Eibu, Ii Hatsugoro, Ando Saburo, Kitajima Isamu, Matsumoto Takekatsu, Ishii Nosuke, Sato Katsuo, Tadanishi Hirotsugu, Kaneda Yoshio, and Kosaka Tatsumi (all Japanese), along with Liu Dehe, Zheng Cishou, Li Caiwang, and Chen Jintu (all Taiwanese). They traveled throughout the province under the guise of tourism, requesting the provincial government to issue passports to facilitate their immediate departure. The provincial government approved the request and instructed its subordinates to provide adequate protection, but requested that they refrain from going to military areas where bandits were being suppressed to avoid danger. It has been found that Japanese and Taiwanese people have recently been secretly taking photographs and drawing maps along the coast and inland, which affects national defense and is of great importance. (3) The Taiwanese in Fujian have traditionally been engaged in running opium dens and setting up gambling houses, which have been detrimental to society. However, they have rarely dealt in highly addictive drugs such as heroin and red pills. Unexpectedly, a Japanese man named Araki Saburo recently opened the Hualong Hospital on North Gate Street in the city, which is actually the headquarters for the distribution of heroin and red pills. It is said that he was ordered to come to Fujian to handle this business. However, the Taiwanese who run opium dens believe that of the 10,000 rickshaw pullers in Fuzhou (Note: There are usually around 5,000 rickshaw pullers in the city, but due to the economic decline in the nearby villages, farmers have flocked to the city to pull rickshaws, resulting in a sudden doubling of the number), no less than half are opium smokers. Recently, due to poor business, they struggle to make ends meet after working all day and find it difficult to afford opium. If red pills and heroin, which are potent and cheap, appear, the rickshaw pullers will inevitably abandon opium and smoke red pills, which will greatly affect the opium den business. However, since the business is run by a Japanese man, there is currently no way to deal with it. (26th)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing Surveys the Reclamation Area in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Plans to settle righteous troops in Hetao</p>
<p>Entering Beijing to discuss funding issues</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zhu Jiqing, a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, recently went to Suichuan to survey the area for settling righteous troops to reclaim the Northwest. On the 27th, he passed through Jinan by train on his way back to Beijing. The reporter met him on the train and interviewed him. According to him, "I have been to Linhe, Hetao, and other places to inspect the area for the righteous troops to reclaim, and have surveyed a section with an area of 140 items. The place is desolate and the wind is very strong. The places where people have reclaimed the Northwest in the past are all in Baotou, Wuyuan, Linhe, etc. The Yellow River passes through these places, and the canals are crisscrossed, tens of feet wide, making it very convenient for irrigating the fields. It has a Jiangnan flavor, and the land is fertile. There is an ancient saying that 'the Yellow River has a hundred harms, but only Hetao is rich,' which refers to this. As early as the Han Dynasty and as late as the Qing Dynasty, people went there to reclaim, but most people could not stay for long. Those who reclaimed would return after the harvest, and no one stayed there for a long time. To this day, it is still desolate. The three counties of Hetao have only about 100,000 people. After I finished my inspection, I returned to Beijing to report and discuss funding. I plan to bring 200 of my old righteous troops there first, and then expand the area when there are results. There are more than a thousand acres of land to the west of that place, and the soil is slightly worse, but each acre can yield five or six buckets of grain. If the number of people increases, we can move them to reclaim that area." (27th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province: Reduction of Exorbitant Taxes and Levies</h3>
<p>Reducing the burden on farmers by more than three million yuan annually</p>
<p>Organizing business tax and urban land value tax to offset the reduction</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: This time, Jiangxi Province followed the central government's decision to abolish exorbitant taxes and levies in order to revive the bankrupt rural areas and farmers in the bandit areas. It is estimated that the reduction will include 2.2 million yuan in surcharges on land taxes in various counties, 1.67 million yuan in surcharges on salt, general merchandise tax, head tax, and other cumbersome and heavy taxes. The above two items will reduce the burden on farmers by between 3 million and 4 million yuan. Regarding offsetting the reduction, it can be divided into the following points: (1) The central government will provide monthly subsidies because Jiangxi is a province fighting bandits and the situation is special. (2) Reduce the excessive expenditures of various counties. (3) Organize new taxes to ensure that undertakings do not stop and that income and expenditure can be balanced. Regarding new taxes, two items are currently being implemented: (1) Business tax. Businesses of all kinds in the city and counties are already registering and declaring their business turnover in order to levy the tax. However, Jiangxi Province has suffered from banditry for years, and businesses are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. The future tax rate will be a few per thousand. (2) Urban land value tax. Last year, Chiang Kai-shek convened an administrative conference of ten provinces in Jiangxi, and the conference decided to collect and spend revenue uniformly and organize the urban land value tax, ordering all provinces to comply. This province is making every effort in this regard. Land registration and surveying in Nanchang City is already 60 to 70 percent complete. The Municipal Committee is currently organizing a land value assessment committee to assess the land value of each district in the city at different levels in order to levy taxes according to the value. For example, the standard price per square foot in the most bustling areas of Zhongshan Road, Desheng Road, and Cuihua Street is 140 yuan, which is about 8,400 yuan per mu. The lowest price is several tens of yuan to more than ten yuan. Once the overall assessment is completed, the tax rate will be announced and the tax will be levied to avoid farmers bearing the burden alone and the tax revenue becoming biased. (May 25)</p>
<h3>He and Zhang Inspect Western Hubei: Conferring with Xu Yuanquan on Plans to Encircle and Suppress He Long, Liu Zhenhua Returns to Anqing and Then Goes to Luan to Supervise Troops</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner of Hubei, and Zhang Qun, the Governor of Hubei Province, went to inspect the military and political situation in western Hubei, to instruct on the aftermath of bandit suppression. On the 28th, they flew together from Hankou to Yichang. Before his departure, He said that he would first go to Yichang, then to Yidu the next day, then to Ouchi, and finally to Shashi to inspect the 48th and 34th Divisions stationed there, and to inspect bandit prevention matters in various places, and give instructions as necessary. He would stay for a maximum of one week and then return to Hankou to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee. After that, he would go to northern Hubei to continue his inspection. Zhang said that the area of this inspection would include eight counties, including Yichang, Yidu, Jianli, and Songzi. His task would be to inspect county administration and troop training, give instructions on improving the situation, and inspect dikes along the river to prepare for floods. The main policies of the province recently are to promote the four major policies telegraphed by Chairman Chiang. The provincial government has prepared a general plan and submitted it to the committee for approval, including (1) Land survey, to be completed in twelve years, with six counties surveyed each year and four counties in the last year. The funds for the survey will be collected from the surveyed counties at a rate of five cents per mu per year, with the provincial treasury subsidizing the shortfall. (2) Population census, to be completed in one year, divided into four phases, to be completed by the end of April next year. (3) Security affairs, the total number of security forces in the province is set at 20,000, and the annual expenses will be reduced from more than 5 million to more than 4 million to lighten the burden on the people. (4) Road construction. County roads will be planned by the county governments, and provincial roads will be built separately according to the routes set by the Seven Provinces Highway Conference to facilitate transportation. In addition, the flood prevention problem is also a concern because the river water is rising, and early preparations are needed. In Hankou, all agencies and organizations will form a flood prevention committee. In Wuchang, the Provincial Engineering Office will be responsible. In the counties, the county governments will be responsible. The funds will be allocated from the special funds for dike construction in Hubei Province, according to the amount used for flood prevention last year, with the approval of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. He and Zhang arrived in Yichang at noon. Xu Yuanquan, the Commander-in-Chief, went from Shashi to meet them. In the afternoon, He inspected the Huang Xin Brigade of the 48th Division, encouraging them to maintain discipline, train hard, and thoroughly suppress bandits. In the evening, they held a meeting with Xu Yuanquan and others to decide on a plan to encircle and suppress He Long, and telegraphed the troops stationed on the border of Hunan and Sichuan to cooperate in suppressing bandits on three sides, regardless of their respective territories. In addition, Liu Zhenhua, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the border areas of the three provinces, came to Hankou to attend the Bandit Suppression Conference of the General Headquarters. On the 28th, he paid another visit to Deputy Commander Zhang to seek instructions. That night, he took the Xinningxing ship back to Anqing. Liu said that after dealing with provincial affairs in Anqing, he would leave for Luan to supervise the suppression of the remaining bandits in the border areas according to the new plan of the Bandit Suppression Conference. If necessary, he would move to Huangchuan. After the bandit suppression campaign came to an end, he would go to northern Anhui to inspect. He Zhuguo, the Commander of the 57th Army, Wang Yizhe, the Commander of the 67th Army, and Hao Mailing, the Commander of the 9th Army, were all scheduled to return to their defenses on the 29th.

<h3>Jiangsu Province: Extended Deadline for Land Tax Assessment This Year, Continuing Collection Until the End of August</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance decided that the land tax collection assessment in this province is divided into two periods: the initial deadline and the final deadline. The final deadline expires at the end of June. Now that the deadline is approaching, but the rural economy is exhausted, it is proposed to extend the deadline by two months and continue the collection until the end of August. This proposal was submitted to the Provincial Government Meeting for approval, and instructions were issued to the county magistrates of the counties for compliance. The original text of the proposal and the instructions of the Provincial Government are recorded below.</p>
<p>The original text of the proposal is as follows: In the case of the proposal, the original assessment method for land tax collection in this province is divided into two periods: the initial deadline and the final deadline. The initial deadline is set at the end of January each year, and the final deadline expires at the end of June. The amount approved for autumn should be collected in full, with the annual account cleared. Otherwise, different punishments will be implemented. This method was originally intended to rectify tax collection and assess the performance of the staff in charge of collection. It should be strictly enforced in accordance with the plan to achieve the actual effect of rectification and supervision. However, due to the recent slack collection season, tax collection has been unusually sluggish. According to the current monthly collection reports of the counties regarding the new tax situation in 1933, it is feared that less than one or two tenths will be able to collect the full amount by the end of June. If the collection is not strong, it should be severely punished according to the rules, and there is no forgiveness. However, the real reason is the decline in grain prices and the bankruptcy of the rural economy, which makes it difficult to improve the collection. This is different from the situation of those who neglect their duties. Moreover, the final deadline is approaching, and it is the peak collection period when the spring harvest is approaching. If the collection can be slightly delayed and the collection becomes smooth immediately, and then a more strict assessment is added, the new tax for this year can actually achieve the purpose of collecting the full amount. It is proposed that after the report is made after the deadline, a grace period of two months should be granted this year, ordering the continued collection until the end of August. The collection made after the deadline should be included in the collection made before the end of June for assessment. Is this appropriate? Please make a decision. Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government issued instructions to the magistrates of sixty counties in Jiangsu Province, saying: According to the matters discussed at the 657th meeting of the Provincial Snow Committee,</p>

<p>Item 14, proposed by Zhao Dihua, the member and Director of the Finance Department, the original method for land tax collection assessment in this province expires at the end of June. Now, due to the exhaustion of the rural economy, it is proposed to grant a grace period of two months, ordering the continued collection until the end of August. The report should be made after the deadline, and the collection made after the deadline should be included in the collection made before the end of June for assessment. Is this appropriate? Please make a decision. After discussion, it was decided "Approved," and the record is on file. In addition to the separate orders, the original proposal is hereby copied and issued to the county magistrates for compliance. However, the original intention of this decision is to take into account the assessment of the counties and extend the deadline by two months after the end of the year. However, by the end of the extended deadline, the counties must completely close the 1933 land tax account to comply with the principle of annual clearance. If there are those who report the end of the account before the extended deadline, this government will give special rewards. This is the order. (29th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Xie Pengshi Sentenced for Murder</h3>
<p>Wu Dimei, also known as Guo Dimei, lived in Wuku. Her family was poor, and she made a living by selling her house to her relative Xie Pengshi. Several years had passed. Whenever Wu was short of money, she would borrow money from Xie Pengshi, commonly known as "adding sighs." On December 26 of last year, Wu went to Xie's place again, claiming to need 500 cash, and they had an argument. In the evening, Wu went again to demand the money. Xie Pengshi, feeling that he had been burdened by this for a long time and could not bear the harassment, suddenly had a murderous intention. He secretly swung a hoe and struck Wu's head violently, causing her to die from a ruptured skull. He wrapped her in a sack and threw her into the river. This year, the village police discovered Wu's body at the 31st Yang Bridge. They reported to the county court for an autopsy, which confirmed the cause of death. The murderer, Xie Pengshi, was arrested and interrogated repeatedly, and the facts were clear. A public prosecution was filed, and today (29th),</p>
<p>The Criminal Court announced the sentence: Xie Pengshi was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for the crime of murder, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Fires Reported in the City</h3>
<p>Shi Qiaosheng, who opened the Heshuntai Lime Store, lived at No. 6 Library Road in the city. The house had three bays on two sides. The front was a newly built building, rented to Li Guisheng, the stationmaster of the local railway station, the private tutor Fang Laichen, and a Mr. Su. Shi lived in the back. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 AM yesterday (29th), there was a sudden fire, and the flames shot through the roof, reaching the sky. The fire was so intense that it was impossible to approach. The firefighters from various sections rushed to the scene to put out the fire, but the back building and the front building were completely destroyed, with losses of more than 3,000 yuan. In addition, the Tongyun Road Tongchun Chinese Medicine Store also had a fire at 3:00 AM yesterday. The flames were roaring on the counter, but fortunately, it was quickly extinguished, and no major disaster occurred.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Market to Open Soon</h3>
<p>Yan Shenyu and Jiang Jingde, the director and deputy director of the Silkworm Model Area Office in this county, were ordered to handle the registration of the cocoon market. However, the cocoon merchants in the county expressed their objections and petitioned the province. The government and merchants are still arguing, and no proper solution has been found. However, the cocoon market is about to open. The Cocoon Industry Association has scheduled a meeting for today (30th) to discuss the opening date and the price of fresh cocoons. In recent days, many cocoon merchants have gone to the office to pay their deposit and register in preparation for buying cocoons. The banking industry in the county previously received a letter from the office stating that loans should be refused to cocoon markets that have not registered. Therefore, banks and money houses are very cautious about issuing loans. The spring silkworms in the four townships are already on the cocoon frames. The late silkworms are at different stages. The lack of mulberry leaves has caused the price to rise to ten yuan per three dan. The price of fresh cocoons in this season will inevitably be low, and silkworm farmers will inevitably suffer losses. Shen Xichun, the director of the Agricultural Extension Institute, visited the silk factories and cocoon merchants yesterday, asking them to increase the price of cocoons produced by the institute and to issue certificates to silkworm farmers. The cocoon merchants will increase the purchase price after seeing the certificates. Regarding the issue of limiting the autumn silkworm production, the Fourth Provincial Improvement Conference previously decided that 900,000 sheets were too many, fearing that the supply would exceed the demand and cause more losses. It was decided to reduce the number appropriately. The deadline for silkworm farmers to register is also planned to be July 20. The mulberry tree production in this county: in 1926, the total mulberry field in the county was 251,0127 mu, which has decreased to 180,000 mu in recent years, and each mu produces about five or six dan of leaves.</p>
<h3>A Ship Carrying Construction Materials for the Xihu Road Capsizes</h3>
<p>The construction of the Xiyu section of the Xihu Road is being contracted by the Shanghai Zhongnan Construction Company, which is actively working on the project. The company previously entrusted the Puji Transportation Company to transport more than 200 pine planks and 294 steel bars (worth about 10,000 yuan) by train from Shanghai to Wuxi. After the train arrived at the Wuxi station, Wang Yangzhi, an employee of the company, hired two barges belonging to Wang Yulin and Gu Apan to load the pine planks and steel bars onto the ships, intending to transport them to the construction site of the Xihu Road in Anzhen, the eighth district of the county, for storage. Unexpectedly, because the load was too heavy and the steel bars were all loaded on the deck, the boat was not stable, and it became heavier on the top and lighter on the bottom. At that time, Yang, the manager of the Yeqin Yarn Factory outside the East Gate, was riding the Samsung motorboat, enjoying a trip from Meiyuan. As he sailed quickly through the waves, Wang Yulin's barge was shaken by the huge waves, swaying from left to right, and capsized suddenly. The entire ship sank, and the pine planks, steel bars, and crew members all fell into the river, causing significant losses. Fortunately, the crew members were rescued. The case is currently being seriously negotiated with the owner of the motorboat.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Indictment in the Fuzhou Ship Case</h3>
<p>Wang Luping from Rugao and Yu Shicheng from Zhenjiang formed the Xincheng Company and rented a ship from a man named Fuzhou to travel between Jiangyin and Xinsheng Port. On January 17 of this year, it was sunk by the Jing'an ship of the Sanbei Company in Longjusha, drowning many people. The families of the victims, such as Yang Hanxiang, filed a lawsuit in Rugao County, and Wang Luping and others filed a lawsuit in Zhenjiang Court. The High Court designated the Shanghai District Court to hear the case. Xiao Puying, the prosecutor of the court, filed a public indictment against Liu Bosheng, the captain of the Jing'an ship, and others for crimes of endangering public safety and causing death by negligence.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Verdict in the Cui Ziqiang Case</h3>
<p>Cui Ziqiang, a clerk in the Changhexing flower shop in Haihu Town, Tenth District, was addicted to opium. On May 2 of last year, he went to the medical office of Wu Huaizhen in the west of the town to quit opium. On the 11th, he suddenly died of cerebral congestion. Cui Xu, his mother, grieved over her son's death and accused Wu County Government of poisoning him out of revenge. With the approval of the county, the High Court dispatched coroner Yi Zhiming to Haimen in December to open the coffin for an autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that he died of illness and there were no other causes. The County Government considered that there was no evidence of poison in Cui Ziqiang's body and that there was insufficient suspicion of murder, and therefore decided not to prosecute.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Markets Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>The cocoon markets in this county held a meeting the other day because the cocoon season was approaching and decided to open uniformly on June 3. The price is 20 to 23 yuan per sima scale catty, which is equivalent to 16 to 18 yuan and 40 cents per market scale catty.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Revenge Killing in the Middle of the Night</h3>
<p>Xu Zhaomin, a director from Dongxiang, Shuyang County, came to Zhenjiang the other day and stayed at the home of Li Xueyin, a resident of Black Bridge West from Shuyang County. Yesterday, he went out for a walk and returned in the evening to sleep in the same room with Li's son. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, at about 3:00 AM, someone pried open the back door and struck Xu's head with a hoe. Blood flowed profusely. Li Xueyin heard the noise and went to investigate. Xu Zhaomin's head was broken, and a hoe was left beside him. Li Xueyin reported to the Baobao and the detective team to strictly apprehend the murderer. The injured person was sent to Hongren Hospital for treatment, but because he had lost too much blood, he could not be saved. He was carried by his fellow villagers to the foot of Baogai Mountain and placed in a thatched shed. He died at 6:00 PM yesterday. The court conducted a detailed examination and instructed Li Xueyin to prepare a coffin for burial pending investigation. At that time, the Zhenjiang Public Security Bureau's detective team had arrested two suspects and were conducting a strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: A Total Market Strike in Twelve Forts</h3>
<p>Twelve Forts in Yizheng has always been a hub for the collection and transit of Huai Salt, with many sailing ships and a dense population. The commerce, finance, and livelihoods of the city are all directly or indirectly related to salt affairs. However, after the Yanghuai Salt Transport Office was moved from Yangzhou to Banpu, the authorities actively promoted transport by steamship. As a result, more than a thousand sailing ships that relied on transporting salt as their main business and tens of thousands of salt workers suddenly lost their jobs. Over the years, they have repeatedly petitioned, but to no avail. Recently, due to the authorities' strong promotion of transport by steamship, their livelihoods have been cut off. Boatmen held a meeting and elected a large number of representatives to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Provincial Government, while all the shops in the city have now suspended business to show their determination. Yesterday (28th), the Salt Transport Officer and Deputy Officer issued a joint announcement, changing 200 steamship tickets for the Xiang Coast to 100 sailing ship tickets and completely changing 200 steamship tickets for the Wan Coast to sailing ship transport. However, all sectors believe that this can only provide temporary relief, and that the fundamental solution has not yet been received. They are still continuing to persist in order to achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Change of Education Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>Fang Zhaozong, the current Director of the Education Bureau of this county, has resigned due to financial difficulties and difficulty in handling affairs. It is reported that the Education Department has approved his resignation and transferred Fang to be the Director of the Education Bureau in Jurong. The department has appointed Chen Shengru from the department to take over in Gaoyou. Director Fang has already telegraphed the bureau to expedite the handover.</p>
<h3>The Scandal of the Director of the People's Education Center Beating Someone</h3>
<p>Qiu Tong, the Director of the People's Education Center in this county, recently hired the Asia Magic Troupe to perform in Gaoyou. Last night, Feng Guohong, the owner of the Xiaopenglai Teahouse, squeezed into the venue to watch without buying a ticket. He was found by the ticket collector, who slapped Feng in the face, causing a dispute. Director Qiu saw this and immediately ordered the other ticket collectors to attack, seriously injuring Feng, which aroused public anger and caused a great uproar. Director Qiu was even more furious, claiming that he had to ask Magistrate Yang to send troops to arrest and severely punish them. At that time, hundreds of spectators followed Qiu to the County Government, but Magistrate Yang refused to see him. Director Qiu was helpless at the County Government. Fearing that he would be surrounded and beaten by the spectators if he went outside, he asked someone to find his cousin Wu Baicuo to mediate and promised to send the injured Feng Guohong to Datong Hospital for treatment, with the medical expenses borne by Qiu Tong. The crowd then dispersed angrily.</p>
<h3>Two Boys Kidnapped at the Same Time</h3>
<p>Last night, eight bandits speaking with a northern accent and holding handguns suddenly broke into the home of Zhao Wenkun, a farmer in Hesheng Village, Second District of the county, and kidnapped Zhao's thirteen-year-old boy, robbing him of clothing and silver dollars. The bandits then went to the home of Zhao Yaozhang in the neighboring village, intending to search and rob. However, after the villagers sounded the alarm by beating gongs, the bandits panicked and took Zhao's six-year-old boy with them, fleeing eastward.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Kidnappers from Pingchao Transferred to Nantong for Trial</h3>
<p>Xu Tianxi, the six-year-old grandson of Xu Mingyuan, a gentry from Pingchao District, was kidnapped by bandits, who demanded a ransom of 25,000 yuan. The kidnappers Ye Songshan, Tang Shunyu, Xie Maoting, and the female bandit Tang Chen, were apprehended in Shanghai by the Third District Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Bureau, and the young hostage was rescued. The four bandits, both male and female, were transferred by the Third District Department to the Thirteenth Team of the Maritime Public Security Department stationed in Tongzhou on the 28th, and then transferred to the Nantong County Government for trial.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Resolution of the Jurisdiction Issue of Baisha</h3>
<p>Baisha in Jiangbei, Ningbo, is located at the intersection of Yin and Zhenhai Counties. The issue of its administrative jurisdiction has been disputed by the governments and people of the two counties for many years without a solution. It is now learned that Zhao Cishang, the Administrative Inspector of the Fifth District, has convened the authorities of the two counties several times to discuss and mediate, and a solution has been reached. The solution is: (1) Public security matters will continue to be the responsibility of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau for the time being. (2) Autonomous matters will be taken over by the Zhenhai County Government. (3) Construction matters will be handled jointly by the Yin and Zhenhai County Governments in accordance with the previously stipulated plan. In addition to being ordered to be approved by the Provincial Government, the above plan has also been forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review and approval.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Young Traveler Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>At the Qintai Second Inn in Hangzhou, a man named Liang Zhongmou, a water carrier, aged 22, had been staying in room number 94 since the 22nd of this month, for about a week. It is reported that Liang, due to his younger siblings studying in Hangzhou and the heavy burden it placed upon him, suffered severe economic pressure, leading him to contemplate suicide. The previous evening, he purchased a bottle of Lysol from a pharmacy and ingested it. He had also prepared two suicide notes in advance, one for his father and one for his brother. Subsequently, due to the poison taking effect, he began to groan, which was heard by a tea server. The server reported it to the police, who then transferred him to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. However, due to the depth of the poisoning, his life is in considerable danger.</p>
<h3>Barber Leaves Behind a Large Sum of Money</h3>
<p>Wang Yongsheng, a barber from Qingtian, aged 62, lived at Xuan Tan Temple, number 46, Erfu Second Bridge, Hangzhou. He had been making a living by setting up a barber stall in the area for 30 years. Although his daily income was meager, he had accumulated considerable savings through frugality. Recently, he contracted a cold and was bedridden for several days, his condition becoming critical. Medication proved ineffective. A neighbor, Zhu Yangxing, the owner of a fruit shop, visited him. Wang then informed him that he had savings hidden within the statue of the deity. Upon inspection, they found a savings account passbook from Wang Bingji South Goods Store with a total principal and interest of 138.10 yuan, as well as 628 yuan in silver dollars, 212 small silver coins, 171 copper coins, and six gold rings weighing a total of 5 taels and 2 qian. After verification by the local police officer, Wang was confirmed to have passed away. The matter was reported to the Hangzhou District Court, which dispatched an official to investigate and confirm that he had died from illness. The savings were then used to purchase a coffin and prepare him for burial.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Major Fire at Qianqing Town</h3>
<p>At Qianqing Town, bordering Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, a fire broke out at the Kuangshengtang Pharmacy owned by Zhu Tingbiao, originally from Cihuo. The pharmacy also served as a postal service counter. On the 24th, the shop owner returned to his hometown, leaving two apprentices in the shop. They were playing chess and accidentally set fire to the bed curtains with a lamp. The fire quickly spread to the roof, making it impossible to approach. Volunteer firefighters from nearby rushed to put out the fire, but everything inside the shop was reduced to ashes. Postal packages and goods were destroyed, and three store rooms in the front and back were burned down. The neighboring Fang A'gao Teahouse was also affected, with a total of seven buildings destroyed, resulting in losses exceeding 7,000 to 8,000 yuan.

<h3>Today Marks the 9th Anniversary of the May 30th Massacre: Board of Directors to Hold Memorial Service at Cemetery, City to Fly Flags at Half-Mast to Mourn</h3>
<p>Today marks the ninth anniversary of the "May 30th Massacre" on Nanjing Road. The Shanghai Garrison Command, the Municipal Security Bureau, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Defense Committee, and other military and police agencies, fearing that reactionary elements might take the opportunity to cause trouble, have ordered their subordinates to intensify</p>
<h3>Security for the Day</h3>
<p>All patrol vehicles, detective squads, supervisors, and male and female inspectors are to be fully deployed on patrol, with increased security at major transportation routes, factory and school areas, and areas bordering the foreign concessions. Double posts are to inspect suspicious pedestrians and prevent illegal demonstrations and gatherings. The foreign concessions are also on high alert. Furthermore, starting tomorrow, the joint defense measures for May will be suspended. The entire city will fly flags at half-mast, and newspapers will suspend publication for the day to express mourning. The Board of Directors of the May 30th Martyrs Cemetery will hold a public memorial service at Fangjia Muqiao</p>
<h3>Today at 9 AM</h3>
<p>and will issue a declaration in lieu of a eulogy, which reads: "Today, the thirtieth day of May in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, the Board of Directors of the May 30th Martyrs Cemetery, Chairman Yu Qiaqing, Vice-Chairmen Wang Xiaolai, Cheng Xiechun, Yuan Ludeng, Qin Runqing, Zhao Jinqing, Zhu Yinjiang, Wang Tingsong, Gu Xinyi, Wu Zhihao, Wang Binyan, Wang Hanliang, and others, respectfully offer flowers and clear spring water in tribute to the spirits of the martyrs, and issue the following declaration on behalf of the Board of Directors: Nine full years ago today, at two o'clock in the afternoon of May 30th, the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, what a tragic scene unfolded in the area of Nanjing Road in front of the Old Zha Gate Police Station of the Shanghai First Special District. Anyone who saw, heard, or knew about it, unless made of wood or stone, can imagine and recall it. The members of the Board of Directors of the May 30th Martyrs Cemetery, to commemorate the past and enlighten the future, and to ensure that we never forget, solemnly declare on this ninth anniversary of the May 30th Massacre, on this day when the shame of the Japanese military occupation of the four northeastern provinces has not yet been avenged: The First Special District is a self-governing area for its residents, and this is an irrefutable fact. Based on this fact, the right of all residents to participate in municipal administration is also a right and duty that should be theirs. However, taxpayers who account for 95% of the population and 55% of the tax revenue (actually more than this) have only obligations and no rights, so the municipal administration is built on an unfair foundation, and its unrest is inherently prone to erupt. It so happened that the Japanese-owned cotton mills, named Inside and Outside, oppressed our Chinese workers to the extreme, and Gu Zhenghong was shot dead. Students and workers, deeply influenced by the doctrines of the Chinese Kuomintang and the fervent calls of Sun Yat-sen, were stirred by righteous indignation and patriotic fervor, carrying the corpse to seek justice and give speeches to seek help. At the same time, Mr. Johnson, the Chief of General Affairs of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the First Special District, who was familiar with the situation, took a leave of absence to return to his country. The Director General at the time was Lu He, who was arrogant and incompetent and failed to mediate properly, allowing the police station to disregard the major case of human life and instead arrest and shoot those who were seeking justice. Thus, the aforementioned unrest erupted. At that time, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted thirteen demands to the envoys of the relevant countries in China: (1) Revoke unnecessary precautions, (2) Release all Chinese arrested in this case and restore the original state of the schools in the Public Concession that were sealed and occupied, (3) Punish the culprits, first suspend them from their duties and await strict investigation, (4) Compensate for the injuries, deaths, and losses suffered by industry, commerce, and schools in this case, (5) Apologize, (6) Take back the Mixed Court, (7) Workers and employees of foreign companies, maritime workers, factory workers, etc., who went on strike due to grief and indignation, should be reinstated in their original positions in the future and not have their salaries deducted, (8) Treat workers favorably, whether they work or not should be voluntary and not punished, (9) The Shanghai Municipal Council voting rights case: (A) The Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors and the Taxpayers' Representatives Association should be jointly organized by Chinese, and the number of taxpayer representatives should be determined in proportion to the amount of tax paid, and taxpayers should have the same voting rights as Westerners of related countries. (B) Voting rights must be verified to ensure that the property is owned or represented, the owned property has voting rights, and the represented property should be enjoyed by the property owner, (10) Stop building roads beyond the boundary, the Shanghai Municipal Council must not build roads beyond the concession, and those that have been built should be unconditionally taken back by the Chinese government for management, (11) Abolish the printing regulations, wharf fees, and stock exchange licensing cases, (12) Chinese in the concession have freedom of speech, assembly, and publication, (13) Replace Lu He, the secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The note also stated that the above thirteen items are only for resolving the local issues of the Shanghai case. To fundamentally improve Sino-foreign friendship and maintain permanent peace, it is necessary to revise the previous unequal treaties. Now, nine years have passed, some of the above thirteen articles have been accomplished in the past, some have been resolved appropriately, and some are still pending. There are three things that should be explained: (1) The abolition of the Mixed Court is a major part of the integrity of Chinese jurisdiction, and Chinese legal scholars have the opportunity to serve with good treatment. (2) The addition of Chinese directors to the Shanghai Municipal Council will change the status of the First Special District and make it a self-governing area for all residents, although it is far from the goal of Article 9 of the aforementioned conditions, but if we strive unremittingly through peaceful struggle, sincerity will move even metal and stone. (3) The construction of roads beyond the boundary has indeed stopped, and the ones that have already been built are being discussed for recovery. Because the Japanese are obstructing it, it has not yet been resolved. However, the proposed amendment to Article 34 of the Shanghai Municipal Council by-laws was actually an indirect cause of the May 30th Massacre. Last year, it was passed by the Western taxpayers' meeting, adding the management of factories, workshops, and industrial equipment to the law. Fortunately, the Chinese taxpayers' association had a counter-proposal, providing the government with an important basis for negotiation. We reflect on the pain, our Chinese nation is a peace-loving nation, and we would not be forced to shed blood unless absolutely necessary. We also do not want to be forced to shed blood. Therefore, even though we have accumulated decades of unfair treatment and have to act out of righteous indignation at times, we still adhere to order and seek justice with empty hands. If this kind of encounter were handled by the Stick-and-Threat Party and the Nazis, both sides would have to shed blood, and it would not only be unarmed students and workers who would be brutally murdered. However, a peaceful nation is not unaware of shame. Because knowing shame is close to courage, the Shameen Massacre in Guangzhou on June 23rd followed, and then the Northern Expedition was completed. Following Sun Yat-sen's will, although we love peace, we are determined to follow in the bloodstained footsteps of the martyrs, revive the national spirit, restore sovereignty, complete the territory, and strive for coexistence and co-prosperity under human equality and mutual assistance, so as to achieve world harmony. We hereby declare this for your public consideration, and inform the martyrs that we humbly beseech their inspection."</p>

At the same time, representatives of the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provincial governments, such as Zeng Yangfu, negotiated a 16 million yuan loan with the Shanghai banking community, which is about to be signed. The Shanghai banking community has formed a syndicate to handle it. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Issuance of Bonds</h3>
<p>The first phase of railway construction bonds totals 12 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, issued at 98% of the face value. Principal repayment will begin on June 30, 1935, and will be repaid in full in 16 installments over eight years, ending on December 31, 1942. The surplus profits of the state-owned railways directly under the Ministry of Railways are designated as the fund. The bonds were issued on May 1st. As for the Yupi Railway bonds, the total amount is 12 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, issued at 98% of the face value. Principal repayment will begin at the end of November 1935, once every six months, and will be repaid in full by the end of May 1943. The local additional tax revenue allocated to Jiangxi Province by the central government, amounting to 1.93 million yuan per year, is designated as the principal and interest repayment fund. The bonds are scheduled to be issued on June 1st.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Railway</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments and the Ministry of Railways, in order to complete the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, issued the first phase of railway construction bonds and Yupi Railway bonds, totaling 24 million yuan. In addition to reorganizing the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Engineering Bureau, which has been completed and opened to traffic, into the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, the Council of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Joint Company appointed Du Zhenyuan as the director and chief engineer, Hou Jiayuan as the deputy director and deputy chief engineer, and Xie Wenlong as the deputy director. As for the Yushan-Pingxiang section of the Yupi Railway, the surveying work has begun and is expected to be completed in June, and then bids will be invited for the earthwork engineering, which is scheduled to officially begin in July.</p>
<h3>Negotiations for the Loan</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments, such as Zeng Yangfu, have negotiated a loan with the Shanghai banking community, including the Bank of China, using the first phase of railway construction bonds of 12 million yuan issued on May 1st and the Yupi Railway bonds of 12 million yuan issued on June 1st as collateral. The total amount of the loan is 16 million yuan, which has already been successfully negotiated, and all arrangements have been agreed upon. The previous report of a 12 million yuan loan established with the Shanghai banking community was a misrepresentation.</p>
<h3>Special Syndicate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai banking community, such as China, Central, Communications, Zhejiang Industrial, and Zhejiang Real Estate banks, which is providing the loan of 16 million yuan to the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments for the construction of the Yupi Railway, has determined the amount of the loan undertaken by each bank and has formed the Yupi Railway Loan Syndicate. All matters are handled by the Bank of China. As for the syndicate, it will be established after the Yupi Railway bonds are issued and the loan contract is officially signed.</p>
<h3>Signing Soon</h3>
<p>The syndicate organized by the Bank of China and other banks, which is providing the loan of 16 million yuan to the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments, originally intended to formally sign the contract as soon as possible. However, although the first phase of railway construction bonds, which are the collateral for the loan, were issued on May 1st, the Yupi Railway bonds must be issued on June 1st. Therefore, the signing of the loan contract must wait until the Yupi Railway bonds are issued before it can be implemented.</p>

<h3>Rent Reduction Association Asks Party and Government Agencies for Assistance in the Baishou Lane Dispute Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Government: "Greetings. Recently, we received a letter from the 19th District Branch of our association stating that the rent reduction work of our association is making every effort, and most of the rent has been deposited in the bank. The landlord, Dehe Company, has no remorse and has filed lawsuits against dozens of households. Among them, member Zheng Mingsuo (No. 21 Baishou Lane, Chen Baoshan) and No. 25 Baishou Lane have deposited all of their rent in the Shanghai Bank. Mediation has failed. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., the case was heard in the 13th Court of the First Special District Court. The judge repeatedly asked whether the Rent Reduction Association had been registered with the party and government agencies. Although the legal counsel, Lawyer Li Shirui, presented reasonable arguments in response, we are still unsure of the outcome. We are therefore asking for your assistance. We believe that the law includes custom and jurisprudence. In today's depressed market, there are many empty houses in the downtown area, and many people are automatically reducing rent. Even if there is no legal basis, it has become an abnormal custom, and the Nanjing Municipal Government's clear order to reduce rent is an excellent precedent in jurisprudence. Now the court is hesitant and regards the registration of party and government agencies as a prerequisite. We therefore respectfully request that your association (your government) forward a letter to the Local Court of the First Special District to speak up for the tenants, so as to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity, and avoid the warning of the demise of the lips and the coldness of the teeth. We dare to express our humble opinion, and hope that you will consider and forward it.</p>

During the memorial service, floral wreaths were sent by China National Aviation Corporation and other parties.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Strike: Social Affairs Bureau's Mediation Failed Yesterday; Strike Committee Sent Letter Requesting Assistance from Du Yuesheng</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, regarding the strike at the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory in Pudong, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation meeting yesterday. Due to the absence of the employer's representative, the mediation failed. The five-district cigarette workers' union hosted people from all walks of life in Pudong, requesting assistance and continuing to send telegrams to the central government to petition. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Mediation Failed: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, considering the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory strike a serious matter and fearing accidents, convened a mediation committee yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to carry out mediation. Labor representatives Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, Yin Zigeng, and Dong Aosheng attended, as well as Lu Yinchu from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Wang Guoxian from the Public Security Bureau. The meeting was chaired by Wang Gang, a mediator from the Social Affairs Bureau. As the employer's representative did not attend and only submitted a written report, stating that what the employer wanted to express had been verbally reported to the Social Affairs Bureau, mediation was impossible. The labor representatives then stated that the employer was violating government laws and regulations, illegally closing the factory, and now disregarding government orders by refusing to attend. If other disputes arise in the future, the employer will be responsible. The chairman announced that he would accept the labor representatives' opinions and request instructions from the director, and that it would be handled according to the regulations for handling labor disputes. The meeting ended without result around 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Reception for All Sectors of Pudong: The Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Workers' Committee, recognizing the factory's tough attitude and the potential difficulty in resolving the strike in the short term, held a reception for all members of the board of directors of the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association and leaders from all walks of life in Pudong at the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 40 people, including Shen Banmei, Pan Hongding, Yang Qingyuan, and Zhang Mingqin, attended. Chen Peide first reported on the history of the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory, the labor reduction dispute, and the shutdown. Pan Zhiwen and Yang Qingyuan then continued to speak, expressing their support. Finally, it was decided that the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association would immediately convene an interim board of directors meeting to discuss assistance measures.</p>
<p>Continued Telegram to the Central Government to Petition: The five-district cigarette workers' union continued to send a telegram to the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Industry, stating: (omitted above) The previous instructions from your esteemed committee should be followed. However, the occurrence of this strike has attracted national attention. Although the municipal party and government agencies have mediated several times, the company's tough attitude has led to no results. At the risk of overstepping, we risk our lives to report to the highest authority in the hope of a legal solution to this case. The workers' demand is only to resume production. If the company can accept this, the strike can be resolved immediately, and both labor and management can easily rebuild their friendship. If there is no effective solution, both sides will go to extremes. On the 29th of this month, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation meeting, but the company refused to attend. Such disregard for the government is unacceptable to public opinion. We respectfully submit the situation and earnestly request your esteemed committee to immediately order the company to resume production to appease everyone.</p>
<p>And solve the problem. We are waiting anxiously.</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Assistance from Mr. Du: The strike committee sent a letter to Mr. Du Yuesheng, the chairman of the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association, requesting him to uphold justice and take on the role of providing assistance. The original letter stated: (omitted above) The Anglo-American Tobacco Company in Pudong suddenly closed its old factory on May 12th without cause, leaving 3,000 workers unemployed. All departments of the new factory have also been shut down in preparation for resistance. It is estimated that the new and old factories have a total of 8,000 workers, and their livelihoods are threatened in one day. Not only are the unemployed workers at risk, but the entire Pudong market will also be unsustainable. Sir, you love your hometown, and I believe you will not stand idly by. Our association, on behalf of 8,000 workers, earnestly requests you to uphold justice and speak out righteously so that the strike can be settled as soon as possible and the Pudong market can be restored as soon as possible. If you agree, not only will all the workers feel the kindness of rebirth, but the elders of the hometown will also offer incense to ten thousand households, and your name will be immortalized forever. We express our request with tears, and we humbly ask for your wise consideration. We respectfully request Chong'an. (omitted below)</p>
<p>Will Organize a Support Association: The Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association believes that the sudden closure of the old factory by the Anglo-American Tobacco Company, which has caused a strike, not only affects the livelihoods of workers, but also affects the Pudong market and hinders local peace. In order to urge the company to realize this and accept government mediation, it has been decided to convene a joint meeting of various organizations in the city to discuss measures to organize a support association in order to deal effectively with the employer.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Announces Reduction of Peanut Tax Rate, With a Six-Month Trial Period</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs issued Announcement No. 1364 to implement the reduction of export tax rates, stating: Now, in accordance with the government's instructions, all of the following reduced export tax rates will be implemented from May 26th for a six-month trial period.

<h3>Chinese Tea Market in Nanyang Islands Invaded by Japan</h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau announced the disastrous situation of Chinese tea trade with Nanyang this year, stating: In the past, our country's exports, such as silk and tea, were mainly to foreign countries and the Nanyang Islands. Later, the silk industry suffered from competition from Japan and other countries, leading to the complete collapse of China's silk industry. Only tea could still be sold abroad. However, in recent years, Chinese tea has also suffered a similar disastrous defeat. Even this year, Chinese tea in the Malayan market has plummeted, accounting for only 20-30% of what it was before. The biggest reason for the failure is the impact of Japanese tea invading the south, as well as the increase in tea production in Malaya in recent years. In addition, a large amount of West Indian tea from Ceylon and Java is imported into Malaya, which is a fatal blow to Chinese tea. According to a recent report from overseas Chinese in the area, the selling price of Chinese tea in the Malayan market is 40 yuan per dan, while the Taiwanese tea produced in Japan has greatly increased its imports to the Nanyang Islands in recent years. Japanese merchants transport Japanese tea from Taiwan to various parts of the island themselves, and the freight is cheaper, so the cost is reduced, and the selling price is only about 20 yuan per dan, which is half the price of Chinese tea. It is clear that it is difficult to compete. The booming Japanese tea market in the Nanyang Islands is the beginning of the disastrous defeat of our tea. If we do not take advantage of this critical moment to find ways to save the situation, the future will be unimaginable. We hope that the people of the country and our tea merchants will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Japanese Purchase Chinese Cocoons</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported that in view of the decline in cocoon prices in China this spring, Japanese businessman Nishimura has raised funds to organize a cocoon purchasing agency, entrusted to Chinese agents. Cocoon firms have been established in Shuanglin Town and Gongchen Bridge, Zhejiang, and cocoon purchases have begun. It is planned to purchase 1,000 dan of dry cocoons per firm, totaling 2,000 dan in both locations. The market price is calculated at 20 yuan per dan of fresh cocoons, requiring a capital of 160,000 yuan, not including all expenses. Whether the cocoons will be sold or reeled into silk after purchase has not yet been decided, depending on the market situation in the future.</p>
<h3>Road Construction Beyond the Shanghai West Boundary: Negotiations on Water and Electricity Business Rights</h3>
<p>Jingdian reported that negotiations on the issues of water and electricity in the Shanghai West Road Construction Beyond the Boundary area have been ongoing for four years with successive mayors. After the Executive Yuan ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to implement 17 principles, the Public Utilities Bureau was instructed to continue negotiations with the Public Concession Water Company based on these principles in order to regain sovereignty as soon as possible. It is now known that the negotiations are progressing, and a considerable result can be obtained on the issue of recovering business rights during the transition period and other measures. However, the other party requires a period of 30 years for the complete takeover by our side. We did not agree with this point because the period was too long, and further consultations are planned.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Stipulates Standard Styles for Rickshaws: Limits Rickshaw Merchants to Comply from Today; Merchants Find Losses Too Great to Accept</h3>
<p>Shi Ye She reported that in order to reorganize rickshaws and replace styles, the Public Concession Rickshaw Affairs Committee has specially formulated standard styles for public rickshaws, limiting rickshaw merchants to comply from today. In the future, no newly manufactured vehicles will be allowed to operate without the permission of the Bureau.

Chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession Rickshaw Affairs Committee, Xiyi, May 29, 1934. General rickshaw merchants in the city were very shocked to hear the news. It is generally believed that after the Rickshaw Affairs Authority has strictly reorganized this time, all operating vehicles and all items have been renovated except for the style. Now, suddenly, a new style is formulated, limiting everyone to comply from today. The losses are unimaginable. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether rickshaw merchants can accept this proposal from the Bureau.</p>

<p>Poor Market Conditions</p>
<h3>Pawnshops Suffering Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Eighteen Months of Interest Completely Sacrificed</p>
<p>Still Selling at 50-60% Off and No One Buying</p>
<p>According to people in the pawnshop industry yesterday, before January 28th, there were a total of 120 new and old pawnshops and more than 1,000 small pawnshops in the city. By this year, there are only 80 pawnshops and more than 700 small pawnshops left. More than 300 large and small pawnshops have closed down in the past three years. This year, the situation is getting worse and worse. Poor people only pawn and don't redeem, and the goods are unsaleable. In addition to completely sacrificing 18 months of interest, goods worth 10,000 yuan are only sold for 5,000-6,000 yuan, and no one is buying. Therefore, meetings have been held several times to discuss unifying the interest rate to 1.8% and reducing the term to 12 months, but no results have been achieved. In this situation, the industry has suffered heavy losses, and more closures are inevitable at the end of the year.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Bank of the Underworld Banknotes</h3>
<p>Easy to Confuse with Real Banknotes</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Has Received Orders</p>
<p>The Chinese people are most superstitious. There is often a so-called Bank of the Underworld banknote sold in the market, regarded as tin foil to be burned. The generally ignorant are often deceived by it, thinking it is a real banknote, which harms society. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters recently forwarded a request from the Dongtai County Party Headquarters to various agencies to crack down on this type of underworld banknote. The Provincial Party Headquarters forwarded it to the Central Propaganda Committee and the Central Party Headquarters. Now, the Central Party Headquarters has forwarded it to the National Government, ordering local governments to investigate and ban it. The city's Public Security Bureau also received the order from the Municipal Government yesterday, "Omitted above, upon investigation, the so-called Bank of the Underworld banknotes are sold on the market, with the words 'five yuan' and 'ten yuan' printed on them. Purchasers regard them as tin foil, thinking that they are underworld banknotes after being burned. Unscrupulous people are actually deceiving the ignorant masses, passing them off as real banknotes, which is a violation of laws and regulations. The ignorant people are often deceived, thinking they are real banknotes. It is necessary to strictly crack down on this kind of superstitious items and prohibit their printing and distribution to avoid harming the ignorant people," and so on.</p>
<p>French Concession</p>
<h3>Shops Fined for Not Affixing Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>The Stamp Duty Office of the French Concession received a report that Zhenhua Lighting Factory and other companies were using altered receipts, not affixing stamp duty, or affixing insufficient amounts. They immediately submitted a request to the Jiangsu Stamp Duty and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to forward a letter to the French General Patrol House to prosecute in accordance with the law. On May 24 and 28, the Shanghai Second Special District Court sentenced Zhenhua Lighting Factory on Jixiang Street to 100 yuan, Yi Ji Cosmetics Store on Pushi Road to 25 yuan, Zhang Yutai Store on Yong'an Street to 20 yuan, Jiangzhe Tobacco Company on Pingjili Road to 80 yuan, and China Yonghe Tobacco Company on Mintiniyin Road to 15 yuan. Xie Changxiang Store in Jiru Lane, Jixiang Street, was also fined 20 yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Large Hat Theft in Courthouse Lawyers' Room</h3>
<p>Thief Wang Jingchu Arrested</p>
<p>From last year to the present, countless lawyers and others have had their hats and coats stolen while appearing in court at the First Special District Court. Although the court has conducted strict investigations, it has had no effect. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, a person named Gan Jingchu stole a hat from lawyer Lin Qingchi in the lawyers' lounge downstairs in the court. He was seen by a bailiff, who immediately arrested him and sent him to the Concession Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case, and said that according to the police investigation, the defendant had previously committed other thefts of lawyers' clothing and hats in the court. Because of the urgency, he had not yet been found out, and requested a postponement. After Judge Wu Xiangzu questioned Wang briefly, he ordered that he be returned to custody and questioned again at a later date.</p>
<p>Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<h3>Reason for Shooting Horses with Glanders</h3>
<p>Reply to China Animal Protection Association Letter</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau replied to the China Animal Protection Association's letter stating, "Regarding your association's letter, the Bureau's shooting of horses with glanders to prevent infection should be noted in advance to avoid delay. It is also feared that our country's behavior of shooting sick horses involves medical immaturity and ridicule from foreign countries. We hope to discuss the matter from a point of fear and adopt a plan and implement it, and hope to reply," etc. After investigation, the horse with glanders was already suffering from the disease when it was transported into the city, and the illness was serious. The effective medical treatment methods for this disease, even in Europe and the United States, are still under research. Livestock with infectious diseases (such as glanders, anthrax, etc.) are all shot and burned, even the cattle plague that does not transmit to humans is also treated in this way, and it is not only our country's plan. The Bureau plans to draw blood and test all horses and mules in the city to prevent infection. Bearing the burden of studying the source of the disease and engaging in prevention, if it is truly seeking truth from facts, then it should start with practical testing. The cost is quite large. If your association has the financial means to assist, the Bureau would be very willing to invite European medical scientists to discuss it so that it can be implemented, (omitted below)."</p>

<h3>This City's High Tide This Morning: Receded from 1:00 AM to 4:00 AM; Tomorrow's Tide at the Same Time Slightly Lower, Will Also Break This Year's Record</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that the Yongpu General Bureau had previously issued a tide forecast for this month, stating that a high tide would occur on the 30th (today) from 1:20 AM to 4:12 AM. The estimated amount would reach a maximum of 11.45 feet, and the speed of the water flow would be 2.2 nautical miles per hour (one nautical mile speed is 6,080 feet per hour, or 0.515 meters per second). The tide will be slightly lower at the same time tomorrow (the 31st), estimated at 11.00 feet, and the speed of the water flow will also be 2.2 nautical miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Guo Shun, General Manager of Wing On Company, Accused of Land Purchase: Witnesses Testify Buildings Were Indeed Demolished; Court Orders Guo Shun to Negotiate with Both Parties</h3>
<p>Guo Shun, the General Manager of Wing On Company, was in negotiations with a widow, Ms. Xu Zhang, to purchase over six fen of land adjacent to the company's Wing On No. 1 Cotton Mill on Lan Road. Ms. Xu Zhang's widowed sister-in-law, Ms. Xu Zhou, learned of this and claimed that the land and buildings were jointly owned by the sisters-in-law and that Ms. Xu Zhang could not dispose of them alone. Consequently, in April of last year, she retained a lawyer who sent a letter to Guo Shun, requesting him to cease the transaction. However, the buyer disregarded this warning, still paid the land price of 11,000 yuan, took possession of the property, erected boundary markers, and ordered the tenants in the houses to move out by August 16th. Ms. Xu Zhou not only sued her aunt, Ms. Xu Zhang, and the local land guarantor, Yang Mengyun, requesting legal action, but also filed a complaint with the First Special District Local Court, accusing Guo Shun of encroachment on the land and damage to the houses. Guo was summoned to court, and ordered to be released on bail pending trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide reopened the trial. Three former tenants, Li Liu, Guo Ye, and others, were summoned and all stated that they were notified by the Wing On Cotton Mill on August 16th of last year to move out. They said they had just moved out that morning when the houses were demolished in the afternoon. They added that the workers demolishing the houses were all Wing On laborers. The court noted that Guo Shun had previously claimed in court that the houses were blown down by a strong wind. Therefore, the witnesses were asked if there had been wind that day, to which they all replied that there was no wind. The court then instructed Guo Shun that his claim that the houses were blown down by the wind was extremely unreasonable. It was highly unlikely that the houses would be conveniently blown down just when he intended to demolish them. The court also pointed out that he had previously stated that the land purchase matter was the responsibility of the factory manager and that the company's articles of association had clear stipulations on this matter. He was asked if he had brought the articles of association, to which Guo Shun presented a copy. However, Judge Feng, after examining the document thoroughly, could not find any explicit clauses related to this matter. Guo Shun then changed his story, claiming that while the factory manager was responsible for land purchases, this was not stipulated in the articles of association. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, supplemented by explaining that the company had a broad scope of operations and that different people were responsible for different tasks. Guo Shun, as the General Manager, was specifically responsible for business operations, while other matters were managed by the company's supervisor, Guo Le. For example, the purchase of the land in question was handled by the factory manager, Guo Youwen, but was subject to the supervision of Guo Le. He requested the court to investigate these circumstances in detail. Lawyer Jiang also submitted a list of witnesses, requesting that they be summoned and questioned to determine whether the houses were demolished or blown down by the wind. Judge Feng then stated that the land in question was jointly owned by Ms. Xu Zhang and Ms. Xu Zhou, which was an established fact. If Guo Shun genuinely wanted to purchase the land, he should have negotiated with both parties. It was no wonder that Ms. Xu Zhou had intervened, especially since she was demanding the restoration of the land to its original condition. Therefore, if Guo Shun still wished to purchase the land, he should negotiate with Ms. Xu Zhou. The case was adjourned to June 9th for further hearing. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Appears in Court to File Suit; Defendant Still Denies; Court Orders Introducer to Appear, or Investigation Will Be Conducted According to Law</h3>
<p>Lawyer Ding Shimin, commissioned by Zhou Xingrong, filed a suit against Hu Zhongyu for breach of trust and embezzlement. The First Special District Local Court had summoned Zhou twice for trial, but Zhou failed to appear. Hu had also filed a counterclaim against Zhou for false accusation. Therefore, Judge Liu Yugui ordered Lawyer Ding to ensure Zhou's appearance in court. Ding verbally agreed in court. However, when the trial continued yesterday afternoon, Zhou himself still failed to appear. Prior to the trial, he sent a written statement to the court, declaring that he had never commissioned Ding Shimin to sue Hu Zhongyu and requesting a thorough investigation. Judge Liu then questioned Lawyer Ding about the circumstances of his commission. Ding claimed that he was not directly commissioned by Zhou but by Fei Xinwen on Zhou's behalf. He added that while the lawyer's fees had not been paid, Fei should be responsible for them. The court then summoned Fei Xinwen, who testified that Zhou Xingrong was his uncle. Zhou's intention to sue Hu arose around December 26th or 27th of last year, and the lawsuit was purchased at that time. He added that Zhou himself signed the characters in the lawsuit at that time. Recently, he asked Ding Shimin to draft and submit the document. Zhou was originally in Hangzhou, but when he went to find him, he was told he had returned to Shanghai, but he had not yet met him. Judge Liu considered Fei's testimony to be mostly empty words and ordered him to bring Zhou to court within three days, or else he would be transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation according to law.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Cables Railway Bureau to Build Freight Warehouses to Aid Rural Areas and Develop Freight Transport; Ten-Year Construction Plan to Be Drafted</h3>
<p>The Joint Administration of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways received a cable from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which stated: "An investigation reveals that the majority of our country's goods production occurs in rural areas inland, not in urban metropolises. However, inland areas lack facilities for freight warehouses. Whenever there is surplus production or a bumper year, unsold goods cannot be stored safely due to the absence of good warehouses to protect them. Therefore, even in urgent situations, the goods cannot be temporarily used as collateral for loans, nor can they be hoarded for better prices. People are forced to sell at a loss, which is disastrous. Consequently, the rural economy has been collapsing in recent years.</p>
<h3>Capital Concentrates in Cities</h3>
<p>This has led to the abnormal development of cities, while the resources of rural areas are being depleted. In cities, capital is concentrated and cannot be used effectively, while in rural areas, it is impossible to obtain capital for circulation. This is currently the greatest crisis facing our country, and its impact extends beyond the declining railway freight transport. The Ministry believes that the mission of railways lies in circulating goods and developing the inland. Now that inland rural areas are on the brink of crisis, the railways should also provide indirect relief to the best of their ability. Although the task of rural economic recovery cannot be accomplished by a single organization, if the railways can devise appropriate measures, it may be possible</p>
<h3>To Assist the Rural Economy</h3>
<p>And promote the development of industry and commerce as well, so that the financial situation in various regions will not be skewed. The "appropriate measures" for the railways themselves include building freight warehouses inland to provide a safe storage place for surplus products, where owners can mortgage their goods at any time. With this in mind, the Ministry first implemented responsible transport last year to ensure the safety of goods and then organized responsible intermodal transport last year to facilitate freight transport. Both of these measures have achieved considerable success, and merchants have gained a significant understanding of them. Therefore, we should now focus on building freight stations and warehouses at various stations to accommodate the surplus agricultural products from rural areas, so that rural producers can hoard their surplus goods to wait for better prices and use the goods as collateral for loans to facilitate capital turnover, and gradually wait for their recovery. As a result, railway freight transport can become increasingly prosperous. After the implementation of this plan, it can not only regulate finance but also enable the supply and demand of products in various regions to be corresponding. The Ministry has previously ordered various railway bureaus to separately store the increased responsible transport fees in a special account, specifically for</p>
<h3>Developing Responsible Freight Transport</h3>
<p>Equipment. Now, to aid rural areas, develop freight transport, regulate finance, and build warehouses, the existing funds should be used as a construction fee as much as possible. The Ministry has drawn up a blueprint for the warehouse construction and is sending it to the bureau as an attachment for reference. These warehouses can be divided into two types: A, ordinary storage, for owners to regularly deposit goods, for which the railway should charge storage fees; B, transport storage, specifically for temporary storage of goods that the railway has already undertaken to transport but has not yet shipped. This temporary storage of goods will not be charged separately, but the use of such warehouses depends on the needs of each station. There is no need to divide them into two types during construction, but when necessary, their nature can be distinguished by their management. The bureau should first plan the following points: (1) Select stations along the railway that most urgently need warehouses and where merchants and goods may be used as loanable collateral in the future; predict the maximum volume of goods entering, leaving, and stockpiling at the station in the next ten years and prepare a</p>
<h3>Warehouse Ten-Year Construction</h3>
<p>Comprehensive plan for staged implementation (2) In the aforementioned plan, for the part needed this year, prepare a construction budget based on the provided blueprint and submit it for approval. (3) The location of the warehouses must be able to be connected, and the branch lines must be able to accommodate a full train for loading and unloading. At the same time, shunting and parking tracks should be considered, so that the vehicles can be used in the most economical way in operation. (4) The construction of the warehouses should be practical and cost-saving. Wooden or concrete pillars can be used around the perimeter, and the warehouse can be covered with white lead. The lower part of the walls around the warehouse can be replaced with white lead sheets, while the upper part of the walls should be made of wire mesh to allow ventilation and light. The interior ground of the warehouse can be tamped with clay (without using concrete or wooden platforms to save money) and paved with wooden planks to allow air to pass through. (5) Since the implementation of responsible transport, how much has the railway bureau collected by the end of May this year? How much has been approved for use? How much is still available? If the remaining funds are used to build the urgently needed warehouses this year, can they be sufficient? If not, how will the railway bureau raise funds? Regarding the above points, the bureau should submit a detailed item-by-item reply before June 20th of this year, and attach a general or sectional map of the warehouses to be built at each station, the station location, the route, the branch line situation, and the connection with the city and rivers in the area for review and approval. It is expected that it can be completed by October of this year. Please comply immediately and do not delay. This is of utmost importance. Minister Gu Mengyu.</p>
<h3>"Flower Association King" Shen Ahong Arrested; Rumored to be Involved in Communist Anti-Reactionary Case; Mao and Others Arrested Simultaneously</h3>

<h3>Jing'an Steamer of San Bei Company Loses Lawsuit, Dismisses All Ship Employees, Judged to Pay 80,000 Yuan; San Bei Expresses Disagreement</h3>
<p>The Jing'an steamer of San Bei Company, was sued by Yu Shicheng, the owner of a small steamer in Zhenjiang Fuzhou. The ship was impounded by the court. This litigation has been going on for over a month. Yesterday, due to the court's verdict to dismiss the crew and the defendant's appeal, the situation is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>Court Verdict</h3>
<p>Yu Shicheng sued the Jing'an steamer of San Bei, for sinking the Fuzhou steamer on January 26th at Longjusha in Jiangyin, resulting in the drowning of 40 people. The Shanghai Ship Collision Committee concluded that the Jing'an did not sink the small steamer and was not responsible. However, after several trials by the court, the prosecutor's office believed that Jing'an was responsible. Therefore, the case was prosecuted. In the past month, the plaintiff and defendant have been summoned for questioning many times. Now, the Shanghai Special District Court has ruled that the Jing'an steamer should compensate 80,000 yuan for the sinking of the Fuzhou steamer to settle the matter.</p>
<h3>Proceeding with Appeal</h3>
<p>San Bei Company believes that Jing'an did not collide with the Fuzhou steamer. Therefore, during the trials in the Zhenjiang and Shanghai courts and the customs impoundment of the ship, the company viewed the case as based on unfounded rumours. They never thought the truth would not come to light, so they did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, the result of the trial after the prosecution was a loss. The company found this verdict strange. Since Jing'an did not collide with the Fuzhou steamer, the court insisted that it caused the accident, confusing right and wrong, which was unacceptable. They have declared their disagreement and decided to appeal immediately. They have already hired a lawyer to handle the appeal procedures.</p>
<h3>Dismissal of Crew</h3>
<p>The Jing'an has been detained for a long time. After the verdict, it was released. Currently, the ship has been moved from the Nanshi Wharf to Gaochang Temple waters to be anchored. However, due to the ongoing litigation, which may not be resolved in a short time, the company decided yesterday to temporarily dismiss all the crew members on the ship, except for a few people who will remain to tend the ship and keep the fire going. All the dismissed employees will be able to return to the ship when the Jing'an resumes sailing in the future, and they will also be given priority when there are vacancies on other ships. However, their salaries will be cut off from today. Therefore, the company has already paid the salaries of the ships to all ship employees yesterday, in preparation for the legal resolution with Yu Shicheng after the shutdown.</p>
<h3>Qin Afa's Case of Killing the Adulterer; The Court Reopened the Trial Yesterday; Qin's Mother-in-Law Proves Everything; Qin's Wife Seems to Have Immoral Behavior</h3>
<p>Qin Afa, a rickshaw puller from Wuxi working for the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company on Beijing Road, previously lived with his wife, Ms. Yu, at No. 529 Wuding Road. Because he heard rumors that Ms. Yu was having an ambiguous relationship with Gao Yihe, a native of Taizhou who lived in the same residence, in order to avoid disputes, he had to move elsewhere to live in peace. On the 19th of this month, he moved to No. 49, Lane 551, Xin Zha Road. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 21st, at 9:00 AM, Qin Afa returned home from the company. As soon as he entered the room, he suddenly saw Gao Yihe and Ms. Yu sitting on the edge of the bed, intimately chatting and expressing their longing after a long separation. Qin was furious. He slapped Ms. Yu. Gao immediately took down a butcher knife from the door and stepped forward to help. Qin snatched the knife, first stabbing Ms. Yu in the leg, and then stabbing Gao in the left leg, causing his death. The patrol division sent Inspector Yao Yuanlong and patrolman Yang Peiwei to carry Gao's body to the morgue for examination, after which it was placed in a coffin. Ms. Yu was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The suspect, Qin Afa, along with the knife, was taken to the First Special Court for interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yuzhu presided over the continued hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. However, since Judge Feng had presided over the case previously, Judge Liu announced a new trial. The patrol division's lawyer, Gan Jingxian, re-stated the case, and added an accusation against the defendant under Article 282, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, for intending to murder his wife, Qin Yu. He said that Ms. Yu's injuries had not yet healed, and that she was still in the hospital for treatment and could not attend the court today. The defendant hired lawyer Chen Rui to defend him. According to the defendant's statement, he had been married to Ms. Yu for a year and a half, and their relationship was generally harmonious. There was indeed an adulterous relationship between her and Gao Yihe. Although he did not witness it, he had seen them together twice. They were very intimate. On the morning of the incident, he went to work at the company. Because he had been moving for days and was tired, he took two more days off and went home. Unexpectedly, the deceased and his wife were sitting on the bed talking. He then beat his wife. The deceased took the knife hanging on the door, intending to harm him. In self-defense, he snatched the knife, first stabbing his wife in the leg. At that time, the deceased stepped forward to pull his hand, accidentally stabbing him in the left leg. It was not a deliberate premeditated act. Judge Liu asked about the origin of the knife. Qin said that because his wife had previously suffered from an evil spirit, he borrowed a butcher knife from a friend in February of last year and hung it on the door to suppress the evil spirit. Yu Genbao, a native of Suzhou, living in Jinjia Road West in Suzhou, testified that the defendant was his son-in-law. His daughter's relationship with the defendant was very good on weekdays. In January of this year, he came to Shanghai to stay at his son-in-law's house on Wuding Road and heard neighbors talking about his daughter spending money extravagantly, indicating immoral behavior. However, he did not know who she was intimate with. Since there were such rumors, there must be a reason. He advised the defendant to move to avoid disputes. The defendant then moved to Xin Zha Road, and he also took a car back to his hometown on the morning of the incident, seeing him off to the station before leaving. He now requested that the defendant be given a lenient sentence. Lawyer Gan from the patrol division stated that the cause of death of the deceased was not stated in the autopsy report. According to the patrol division, the deceased was injured in the leg, but it was a question whether the leg injury could be fatal. He requested that the coroner be informed to provide a detailed report. Judge Liu reviewed the report and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody. The case was adjourned for seven days.</p>
<h3>The Second District of the Central District of the Municipal Staff Land Distribution Area; The Land Bureau Began Distribution Yesterday; Officially Informs Various Bureaus to Notify Staff Members to Go to Accept the Land According to Regulations</h3>
<p>The second district of the Shanghai Municipal Central District staff land distribution area, covering a total area of approximately fourteen mu, began distribution yesterday. The Land Bureau officially informed various municipal party and government agencies, requesting them to notify their staff members to go to accept the land according to the land distribution regulations. Details are listed below.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau's Letter</h3>
<p>The Land Bureau yesterday sent letters to various bureaus and party and government agencies, stating, "According to Municipal Government Instruction No. 9590, based on the report submitted by the Municipal Central District Construction Committee, based on the letter from Municipal staff members He Mengqi and others, requesting to designate land in the Central District for continued distribution according to the staff land distribution regulations, after investigation, there is still the second district of the Municipal Central Staff Land Distribution Area, covering a total area of approximately fourteen mu, which has not been taken by staff members of the municipal party and government agencies. It is now proposed to continue distributing the land according to the new regulations for the second staff land distribution (i.e., approximately five to six fen per unit) to meet the needs of colleagues in various bureaus. Is this feasible? We are submitting this report along with the regulations for the continued requisition of the second district in the first staff land distribution area to the government for review and instructions. Besides instructions, we order the Bureau to handle the matter properly with the Committee and report back. If colleagues in your Bureau who did not receive land in the previous distribution wish to receive land this time, they can first prepare a partial land price of 200 yuan and come to this Bureau to fill out an application form for selection. However, the number of plots is limited, and the first to arrive will be the first to receive until all the land is distributed. We hope you will check and notify accordingly.</p>
<h3>Land Distribution Regulations</h3>
<p>The staff land distribution regulations are as follows: (1) The price of the distributed land is calculated at 2,000 yuan per mu as originally determined. (2) Each person is limited to receiving one unit of land (approximately five to six fen). (3) For payment, half of the land price can be paid in installments over four years from 1935. The other half must be paid at the time of acceptance, with 200 yuan paid for each unit first, and the remaining amount paid in monthly installments before 1934. (4) After the entire land price has been paid, a land ownership certificate will be issued. (5) Staff members who have already received land in the staff district are not allowed to receive land this time. (6) All other matters will be handled in accordance with the regulations for the first staff land distribution.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Shangchuan Automobile; Increased Number of Trips; Changed Special Class Time</h3>
<p>Shangchuan Automobile, which operates between Qingning Temple in Pudong and Chuansha, the first bus from Chuansha station was at 7:00 AM, and passengers arrived at Tongru Wharf in Shanghai at 9:00 AM. The company is increasing the number of trips as summer approaches. Government and business circles in Shanghai are starting work one hour earlier. Most people from Pudong who work in Shanghai return to their hometown to rest on Saturdays and return to Shanghai for work on Mondays. To meet this demand, the company decided to add an extra bus from Chuansha station at 6:00 AM and from Qingning Temple station at 7:00 AM every Monday from June 1st to the end of September, so that passengers can arrive in Shanghai before 8:00 AM and be on time for work.</p>
<p>Previously, the company launched a special bus from Chuansha station at 7:00 AM and from Qingning Temple station at 8:00 AM to benefit the common people. The fare was cheaper than regular buses. For several months, the general public, merchants and small vendors have benefited greatly. Recently, passengers from Nanhui complained that the schedule was too early and they could not catch the bus. The company then changed the special class schedule to 12:00 noon for both Chuansha and Qingning Temple stations. Connect with the shipping transportation with Nanhui. Tickets will be calculated at the previously set special class fare so that all passengers, near and far, can benefit. The original buses from Chuansha station at 7:00 AM and from Qingning Temple station at 8:00 AM will continue to operate as before, but the fare will not be reduced.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of Yuanyi Bank Yesterday</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Shanghai market has formed into an internationalized financial market, where the prices of various goods and securities rise and fall with the trends of foreign markets. Moreover, domestic investors are increasingly aware of the principles of risk diversification, and use a portion of their funds to purchase foreign bonds and stocks for profit. At the same time, domestic industries are gradually developing. As more and more yarn factories and flour mills are established, it is necessary to purchase large quantities of foreign cotton and wheat in advance to prepare for their use. Thus, the relationship between foreign markets and China's industrial and financial circles is becoming increasingly close. Unfortunately, Chinese merchants who want to explore foreign markets must rely on foreign merchants as agents, which is not only hindered by language barriers, but also involves many twists and turns, which is very inconvenient. As a result, good opportunities are often missed due to the fleeting nature of market prices, which is regrettable. Prominent figures in the financial and industrial circles of this port, seeing this, have pooled capital of one million yuan to establish Yuanyi Bank, specializing in acting as an agent for customers in domestic and foreign securities and commodity transactions.</p>
<h3>Types of Business</h3>
<p>Domestically, the bank is a broker for the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange and the Gold Exchange. In the United States, after strict examination by the local authorities, the bank has been selected as a broker for the New York Stock Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange, which is a great honor for Chinese merchants. Currently, the bank's business scope is divided into domestic and foreign departments. The domestic department includes government bonds, stocks, gold futures, gold bullion, cotton yarn, and foreign exchange. The foreign department includes bonds, stocks, silver, wheat, rubber, cotton, raw silk, sugar, hardware, and miscellaneous grains. Business hours are from 9:00 AM to 1:00 AM every day.</p>
<h3>Preparation Status</h3>
<p>The bank has leased the entire second floor of the Kenye Building on Beijing Road, which is spacious. All the main equipment was ordered from foreign countries and transported to China for installation by the bank's specially appointed commissioners during their on-site inspections in the United States. Therefore, it is comparable to the equipment of major brokerage firms in New York. Information on the market prices of various overseas markets is received daily via direct telegram, which is extremely fast.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the bank's official opening day. Prominent figures from all walks of life in the port came to congratulate the bank from morning to night, and were warmly received by the bank's General Manager Shao Changchun and Manager Ge Jisheng with refreshments and were presented with beautiful business card holders as souvenirs.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Gas Company's New Factory in Yangshupu Completed</h3>
<p>Shanghai Gas Company provides the public with the latest and cleanest fuel. In recent years, its business has made great progress. It invested five million yuan to build a new factory in Yangshupu, with perfect equipment, which can be said to be the best in the world. The company was founded in 1862. On February 26th of that year, the company published an advertisement to solicit shares, with a total capital of 100,000 taels and 100 taels per share. At that time, it planned to supply 500 street lights, 200 Western users, and 1,500 other gas lamps. In 1865, it officially supplied gas, with 58 users, covering a total of 5 English acres. The cost was 4 yuan and 5 jiao per thousand cubic feet. Later, in 1881, the Shanghai Municipal Council adopted electric lights for street lights, which greatly affected the company's business. In the winter of 1900, the company was registered in Hong Kong and became a limited company. Through the hard work of various authorities, the company has overcome difficulties with an indomitable spirit, and finally has the prosperity it has today. The number of users has increased to 13,384, and the price per thousand cubic feet is only 2 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen. The total length of the main pipe is 165.53 English miles. The new factory in Yangshupu covers an area of 32 mu, with a width of 160 feet and a length of 1,425 feet. All the latest equipment for gas is available. It is said that the current manager and chief engineer, Mr. Beck, has made many contributions to the company since he took office in 1932. It is in the ascendant, and the future development is unlimited.</p>
<h3>Women's Temperance Association's New Board of Directors Established Today</h3>
<p>Since the close of the third National Congress of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association nearly a month ago, in order to promote the association's affairs, a meeting of the third board of directors will be held today at noon on the fifth floor of the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road. The meeting will be attended by re-elected directors Madam Guo Bingwen, Madam Mao Keren, Madam Wang Ruilin, Madam Yu Rizhang, Madam Li Zhongdao, Madam Yu Zhiqi, new directors Madam Lin Zhuoran, Madam Lin Zhanfang, Madam Ji Changgeng, Madam Duan Da San, and Ms. Ding Cailian, Chen Xiaqiufang, Zhu Wang Huanqing, Wu Weichengning, Chen Wenxian, Chen Yongsheng, Liu Mingzhen, Xu Shuji, Mao Yunnian, and Xiang Wanqing. In addition to electing standing directors, the meeting will discuss the issue of registration, the selection of editors for the Temperance Monthly, and the budget for 1934-1935.</p>
<h3>China Anti-Tuberculosis Association to Hold Children's Summer Camp</h3>
<p>In view of the arrival of summer, a season when tuberculosis is prone to occur, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association is holding a children's summer camp at the National Tongji University in Wusong to enable children to have a considerable understanding of tuberculosis prevention.

<h3>Silk Industry Bank Announces Essay Contest Results; Over 2,000 Entries Received; First Prize Winner Gao Tianqi Receives 200 Yuan Reward</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank has always regarded serving society as its mission. Recently, in view of the declining social morality and people's indulgence in extravagance, and the ancient virtues of diligence and thrift being irretrievably lost, in order to awaken national consciousness and revive the virtues of thrift, the bank published a call for essays on frugal virtues and new savings regulations. A total of more than 2,000 entries were received. It is learned that the bank hired seven experts, Yan Duhuo, Li Jinhui, Xu Yongzuo, Zheng Jinwen, Chen Xiaodie, Little Reporter, and Zhu Xinong, as review committee members, together with Luo Qinghua, the bank's deputy manager and director of the savings department, to determine the rankings.

<h3>Failure to Pay Rent and Resistance to Delivery; Seizure of Property and Rampant Insults; Wu Shirong Sued by Police for Obstructing Official Duties and Public Insult</h3>
<p>Wu Shirong, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 8, Jingyi Lane, Malan Road, in the French Concession, recently accumulated rent arrears of more than 100 yuan and failed to pay them, resulting in the landlord, Huizhong Bank, filing a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court. A judgment was made to repay the amount in full. After being summoned by the execution court to pay within a limited time, Wu still refused to pay. Therefore, the execution judge ordered the seizure of property for compensation. On the 17th of this month, the judge ordered clerk Wu Shan, together with bailiff Wang Changji and police officer Chen Shirong No. 418, to accompany the plaintiff to Wu Shirong's residence to implement the seizure. However, Wu neither provided a guarantee nor pleaded with the plaintiff landlord to avoid the seizure. Instead, he was stubbornly unreasonable, arbitrarily insulting the clerk and others, and preventing them from counting the items and affixing seals, leading to a conflict and attracting many onlookers. At this point, clerk Wu, considering Wu to be barbaric and unreasonable, immediately ordered the police officer to arrest Wu Shirong and bring him to the court to report to the judge, who transferred him to the prosecutor's office for investigation. After the chief prosecutor Chen Beisan opened a court for interrogation, he filed a public prosecution with the court of the same level on the grounds of obstructing official duties and public insult, requesting a legal trial. Yesterday, judge Qiu Huan, together with chief prosecutor Chen, opened the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. First, the prosecutor stated the intention of the prosecution, and then the bailiff, police officer, and other witnesses provided evidence. When questioned, the defendant Wu Shirong confessed that he was unaware of the court rules and begged for leniency. Without a lawyer's defense, the court declared the trial concluded and scheduled the verdict for the 31st.</p>

<h3>Three People Accidentally Fell into the River; All Drowned</h3>
<p>At 7 o'clock last night, a wharf boat was moored at the Longmao Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong. Zhang Linsheng, the boatman, was having dinner when he accidentally fell into the river. Boatmate Pan Gengen tried to rescue him, but Zhang did not surface after falling into the water and drowned. Afterwards, Pan reported to the Customs Water Police Station for record. The deceased was 49 years old and a native of Pudong. His body has not yet been recovered.</p>
<p>At 6 o'clock yesterday morning, Shao Shouhai, a compradore's assistant from Zhenjiang on the 亞光輪 (Ya Guang) steamer, age 21, went to the side of the ship to fetch water. Unexpectedly, he lost his footing and suddenly fell into the river. At that time, colleagues Lu Zhangxing, Zeng Afa, and others were coming by sampan and saw Shao fall into the water. After briefly showing his eyebrows, he immediately sank and could not be saved. Afterwards, Chinese and Western officers from the Water Police Station searched for the body nearby, but it was not recovered by evening.</p>
<p>At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, a small Longmao foreign company steamboat was carrying passengers from the Guangdong Road Wharf when an eleven- or twelve-year-old boy ran from the shore. Seeing that the boat was still close to the wharf, he jumped. Although his feet were on the boat, he could not stand and fell backwards into the river. The boat's sailors were unable to rescue him in time, and he drowned. The body sank and its whereabouts are unknown. The deceased's family has not yet been notified.</p>
<h3>Chen Ziwen Lost Diary and Banknotes; Reward for Return</h3>

The loss is undoubtedly unfortunate, but the diary contains trivial household matters, which are worthless to others but of great importance to me personally. If a gentleman is unwilling to take advantage and kindly returns the item to its owner, not only will no further investigation be pursued, but a considerable reward will be offered. I dare to guarantee with my personal reputation and integrity. I hope the gentleman will not be suspicious. Thank you very much. Contact address: this newspaper, Chen Ziwen.</p>

Not only has he surpassed his teacher in consumptive lung diseases, but Mr. Feng has also devoted his spare time to researching damp-warm febrile diseases. In the past three or four years, he has cured no less than a hundred people. Recently, Mr. Zhang returned to his hometown due to old age, and the patients in Daqing Lane unanimously requested Mr. Feng to move in to benefit the patients. Mr. Feng could not refuse, so he moved to No. 23 Daqing Lane every afternoon from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM to continue Mr. Zhang Jingchu's practice and treat patients.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Association Requests Additional Regulations for the Sale of Medicinal Anesthetics</h3>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Association held a meeting yesterday to discuss the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Command's order, issued on May 19 and carried in Shen Bao, to strictly investigate and ban potent narcotics. Since these drugs are indispensable in new medical treatments, and the association members' business is selling medicinal drugs, various health organizations and formal physicians use these toxic drugs to prepare prescriptions. It is not permissible to refuse to sell them, but doing so raises the suspicion of breaking the law. Therefore, they should be able to sell them with the signature of a legitimate physician. Although the government has promulgated revised regulations for the management of narcotics, the implementing agency has not yet been determined, so they have not been effectively implemented. The authorities should be requested to issue additional regulations for the sale of medicinal anesthetics to facilitate medical treatment and prevent abuse. It was decided to proceed accordingly.</p>

After six years and ten months, they do not have to save anymore, and can receive the original savings amount from the bank each month (for example, if they save 5 yuan per month, they can receive 5 yuan from the bank each month after six years and ten months, and so on for larger amounts), forever. At any time after the maturity date, if they encounter an emergency, they can withdraw the principal and interest in one lump sum, with the amount paid out at 120 times the original monthly savings. Type B savers deposit a lump sum savings amount in one go, and the bank issues a deposit slip, and they do not have to save any more. After ten years, the bank will return the original savings amount, and they can also withdraw interest from the bank every year (for example, if they deposit 1,000 yuan in one go, they will receive 1,000 yuan back after ten years, and can withdraw 180 yuan from the bank every year thereafter, and so on for other amounts), forever. At any time after the maturity date, if they encounter an emergency, they can withdraw the interest in one lump sum, with the amount paid out at 1.6 times the original principal, which is very suitable for education, marriage, and retirement.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai News item in your newspaper on the 23rd regarding Buddhist monks going to Japan to participate in a humiliating national convention, the letter writer's patriotism is commendable, but the fact is that the error was due to empty propaganda by the Japanese. Regarding the "Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth League Alliance" meeting in Japan, last winter the planning director of the alliance sent a letter inviting us to attend. Upon discovering that "Manchukuo" was listed among them, we immediately and strictly refused, and the opinions of Buddhists throughout the country were all the same. However, this year there are a few individuals who are automatically preparing to go to Japan to study Esoteric Buddhism and investigate Buddhism. Upon hearing this, the alliance sent a letter enticing them to attend the meeting as observers, and made empty propaganda in Japanese newspapers, thus creating this inaccurate rumor. In fact, this is a unilateral wish of the Japanese, and there is absolutely no so-called Chang Xing or others agreeing to attend the meeting. A few days ago, I met with Masters Chang Xing and Chao Yi in Hangzhou and confirmed that there was absolutely no intention to attend the meeting. Therefore, I am making a factual statement and request that it be published in the letter column of your newspaper.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Taixu</p>

<h3>Discussion on Whether the Remittance System Should Be Abolished</h3>
<p>— Feng Yigui</p>
<p>The emergence of any system must have its own unique reasons and is never accidental. The ability of this system to endure must have its own truly valuable existence, and it cannot be abolished by empty words. The remittance system is one such example. Research into the Shanghai money industry's creation of the remittance system reveals that it was originally established to resist the monopoly of foreign banks on Shanghai's finances. It has been practiced for nearly fifty years and has been silently accepted by all sectors without any complaints. In recent years, the proliferation of Chinese banks has seen them all imitate the system, as it benefits finance and does not harm any sector. However, yesterday's Shen Bao published a letter from Mr. Pan Hengqin advocating for the abolition of remittances and the receipt of cash the next day. While improving financial organization and increasing service efficiency are indeed what we earnestly hope for, removing defenses and giving others opportunities, even leading to a situation of cash depletion and financial collapse, is something that no one with conscience would dare to suggest. It is possible that Mr. Pan is not fully aware of the underlying principles of this system. Therefore, I will not hesitate to elaborate and discuss this with Mr. Pan, while also seeking correction from contemporary wise men. (1) The claim that remittances can only be cashed the next day is not true for all types of remittance instruments. Traditionally, transactions between firms within the same industry, as well as between Chinese banks and money shops, are completed on the same day. Only foreign banks and a small number of Chinese banks that use clearinghouse transfers require the next day for cash receipt. Therefore, the remittance system does not cause inconvenience within the Chinese financial industry. On the contrary, some foreign firms in Shanghai, due to the inconvenience of depositing remittance instruments with foreign banks, have opened accounts with Chinese banks. This shows that this system, in normal times, serves as a way to protect sovereignty in relation to foreign merchants, curb their ambition of economic aggression, and shatter their illusion of monopolizing finance. (2) The remittance system does not cause any losses to any sector of the Chinese business community. When Chinese merchants issue drafts to money shops, they specify the payment date, and the money shop accounts for that date. When money shops receive drafts, they account for the maturity date, so there is no loss at all. Only when presenting drafts for goods from foreign merchants engaged in import trade must the foreign merchants wait until the day after the maturity date to receive cash. Therefore, the party losing out is the foreign merchant, which has nothing to do with the Chinese merchant. However, foreign merchants have not raised any objections for fifty years, and now Mr. Pan is speaking on their behalf, which is misguided. (3) The remittance system, in normal times, is actually a type of exchange system. Mutual remittances between firms in the same industry, with all differences settled in cash. Therefore, to say that the remittance system is a kind of empty system is a slanderous accusation. If saving the hassle of cash transportation is considered a drawback of the remittance system, then the check clearing system should not be discussed, and the check clearing house should not have been established. (4) Limiting remittance instruments to intra-industry remittances on the same day is like limiting parallel checks to deposit by banks and money shops. If cash withdrawal is desired, it is deferred to the next day to give the person who lost the check time to report it lost or investigate. The restriction on foreign banks requiring next-day cash receipt is because foreign banks have the ambition to monopolize Shanghai's finance and are not subject to the constraints of the money shops' remittance system. They insist on withdrawing cash into their vaults, so it is specifically stipulated that cash be paid the next day to show restriction. As a result, foreign firms, attracted by the convenience of Chinese banks accepting remittance instruments, have increasingly switched to doing business with Chinese banks. Otherwise, why would they choose the roundabout route over the direct one? (5) Fundamentally, protecting finance and maintaining the market are the responsibilities of the government. Therefore, when financial panics or unusual market changes occur in various countries, the government will issue emergency financial decrees to cope with the situation, such as banning gold exports, banning the purchase of foreign exchange, and prohibiting deposits in foreign banks, all in order to prevent cash outflow. However, our country's doors are wide open, and there are foreign banks everywhere in the country. The government cannot normally control them and has no right to intervene in times of crisis. Therefore, whenever there is a financial panic, foreign merchants buy heavily, transferring deposits to foreign banks or scrambling to buy foreign exchange to protect themselves. Foreign banks, relying on extraterritoriality as a shield, can freely transport cash for export. Even if the government wants to prohibit it, the situation is like enemy ships patrolling the Yangtze River, yet issuing an order to blockade the port; the effect is virtually zero. In this environment, what is the level of danger? If Chinese financial institutions do not rise up to defend themselves, they will all perish together. The remittance system has been able to cope with this extraordinary situation. To not mention distant events, during the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's financial panic reached its peak. Deposits in Chinese banks were transferred to foreign banks, amounting to millions per day at the beginning of the incident. The situation was precarious. Finally, relying on the unity of Chinese banks and money shops, the adoption of the remittance transfer system was able to support the difficult situation and overcome the difficulties. At that time, even the large Bank of Communications and Bank of China, which had always used clearinghouse transfers, switched to using intra-industry remittances for intermediary telegraphic transfers and remittances. The fact that the Shanghai market was not ruined by the January 28th Incident is truly due to the word "remittance". Even if Mr. Pan has forgotten, the Chinese people should not have difficulty remembering. If the current concentration of cash and loose chips is considered a good opportunity to abolish remittances, is this not like eating one's fill and then emptying the granary, or quenching one's thirst and then cutting off the water source? Although Shanghai's reserves seem plentiful, the total reserves of Chinese banks are less than those of foreign banks. If the reserve funds and floating capital are removed, there is little left. How much remains for use in the event of economic cracks is something that even the wise do not dare to predict. "Think of danger in times of safety" is an ancient proverb. The sun wanes after noon, and the moon wanes after being full. Storms often strike after warm, sunny days. Moreover, market changes often defy common sense. Who can predict that there will not be another panic like the January 28th Incident after today? The remittance system should be maintained and strengthened, how can it be hastily abolished? In summary, Shanghai's situation is complex, and the financial industry is particularly crucial to a country's economic lifeline. Even slight missteps can provide an opportunity for the other party to exploit. Critics often see the hair but not the firewood, focusing on the dichotomy of the collection and payment system while ignoring that Shanghai is a place where foreign banks are watching from the side, constantly looking for opportunities to seize our money and leave, leading to our demise. It is because of this complex environment that we had to create this abnormal system to counter it. The remittance system is the only defense line for the Chinese financial industry to resist foreign economic aggression. If the Chinese people were to strive for strength and foreign banks had no foothold in China, or if foreign merchants in China could all abide by government orders, then the remittance system would naturally be on the list for abolition. Otherwise, it would only be a self-destructive act, allowing imperialists to laugh at us from the sidelines. Mr. Pan, a man of understanding, may not consider these words as irrelevant babble.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Reading "Reading Q&amp;A Collection - Questions" (II)</h3>
<p>丨Can a person's unique social life determine his thinking丨</p>
<p>Mr. Li Xiafeng raised a question about the "Reading Q&amp;A Collection": "Can a person's unique social life influence and determine his thinking?" This question arose because we said in the article "Preliminary Reading of Social Sciences" (P. bl) that "this is not only because he was influenced by the school of thought, but also because his unique social life determined that he accepted a certain school of thought and rejected another." Now, in order to dispel Mr. Li's doubts, we must specifically raise this issue for clarification. To understand whether a person's thinking is determined by his unique social life, we must first find out how thinking arises and what relationship thinking has with social life.</p>
<p>How does human thought arise? Some people think it is innate, which of course no one believes. Some people think it is naturally produced by the machine of the brain: people with simple brains have dull and simple thoughts, while people with healthy brains have rich and precise thoughts. White people's brains are more active and developed than black people's, so white people's thinking far exceeds that of black people, and white people's culture far surpasses black people's culture. This argument is still a specious view. We certainly do not deny that the brain (the nervous system) is the engine of thought. A machine is used more, the more flexible it becomes, and when it is not used for a long time, it easily rusts. This principle is also obvious. But we want to ask, if a factory has only a machine but no raw materials, can the machine still produce goods? In other words, if a person has only a brain but no raw materials for the brain to use, can he still produce thoughts? Without a doubt, this is impossible! A person who sits in a well and looks at the sky thinks that the sky is only as big as the mouth of the well. This is not because his brain is different from others, but because his knowledge is limited, and he cannot see a bigger sky outside the mouth of the well. It can be seen that what constitutes human thought is neither God nor simply an empty brain, but the myriad things in the outside world - that is, the existence of society. The complex phenomena of society are reflected in the human brain and, after a process of selection, produce what is called thought. The brain only has the function of accumulating and selecting, but not the function of deciding. One cannot talk about thought without existence. Since thought is something manufactured from complex social phenomena as raw materials, then it should be undeniable that a person's thinking cannot transcend his environment and his society. The society of the Middle Ages could not produce the idea of ​​democratic politics, but now, democratic politics are no longer fashionable. Confucius, who is regarded as a teacher for all generations, no matter how many people still worship him, his thoughts are much simpler than those of an ordinary person today, because today's society is much more complex than Confucius' time, and people's knowledge and experiences are naturally many times richer than Confucius'. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a great revolutionary and thinker. If we want to understand Dr. Sun's thoughts, it is impossible to ignore his unique social life. Why did Dr. Sun's revolutionary ideas not arise in the Tang and Song dynasties? Obviously, this was neither the will of heaven, nor was it because there were no people with Dr. Sun's "genius" in the Tang and Song dynasties, but because the social conditions for that kind of revolutionary thought had not yet arisen. Dr. Sun was born after international imperialism invaded China, the foundation of the old society had been shaken, the government of the Qing Dynasty was becoming increasingly corrupt, and it was extremely cruel internally and completely lost its ability to resist externally. Moreover, the economic and military aggression of imperialism was increasing, endangering the nation's vitality. These facts, reflected in Dr. Sun's mind, formed Dr. Sun's revolutionary ideas. Dr. Sun was from Guangdong, the first place to have contact with imperialism, and also the place that suffered the earliest and deepest oppression from imperialism. Guangdong was the first to bear the brunt of the Opium War. This point can further help us understand that Dr. Sun's revolutionary thoughts were determined by his unique social life, and that is why Guangdong was able to become the source of the revolution.</p>
<p>Based on the examples cited above, I think Mr. Zhu should have understood the general idea of ​​the question of whether thought is determined by social life. However, the problem is, why does a landlord's son sympathize with serfs, and why does a scholar in a capitalist society have anti-capitalist ideas? In Mr. Zhu's view, this must be seen as a contradiction with our argument. Actually, it is not! Today's society is constantly developing in contradiction. With landlords, there will inevitably be serfs; with capitalism, there will inevitably be many shortcomings contained in capitalism. A progressive thinker not only sees the surface of society, but also sees the inside of society; he not only sees the static aspects of society, but also sees the dynamic aspects of society. For example, Turgenev (a great Russian writer) was the son of a landlord, but his "Hunter's Notes" became the first famous work to shout out the cry for "Emancipation of the Serfs." This was because Turgenev saw the ugliness of serfdom and saw that the emancipation of the serfs had become an urgent requirement of society at that time, so he violated his own class and spoke out for the serfs. His idea was still reflected from the special social life at that time. May I ask, if there was no serfdom at that time, how would Turgenev's idea of ​​serf emancipation have arisen? Sun Yat-sen and Liang Qichao lived at the same time. Dr. Sun knew that the only way to save the national crisis was revolution, while Liang Qichao was limited to proposing a constitutional monarchy. The difference was that Liang Qichao only saw the superficial phenomena of society, so his thoughts were conservative; while Dr. Sun was able to go deeper and see the crux of Chinese society, and in which direction Chinese society should and is developing, so his thoughts were progressive. All this only points out how a person should make a deep observation of the current society, and how he should use his brain, but it can never be presented as a counter-evidence to "thought is determined by social life."</p>
<p>A person's thinking must be determined by his unique social life, but how to use his own brain and how to penetrate his vision into the bottom of society is a matter for each individual. In the entire process of thinking, the former is the content, and the latter is only a function that constitutes thinking.</p>

<h3>World-Renowned School Architecture Expert Mr. Xu De Visits the New Base of Central University</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu De, a world-renowned school architecture expert, arrived in Nanjing on the 26th and met with Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education. On the 27th, Mr. Xu, along with Wang Shijie of the Ministry of Education, Li Jiaxiang, a commissioner of the Ministry of Education, Luo Jialun, President of Central University, and Professor Chu, director of the Architecture Department of Central University, went outside Zhonghua Gate to Niushou Mountain to visit the new base of Central University. (Central University plans to find a large base near Niushou Mountain to unite all colleges, so that all colleges can be set up in one place. Niushou is a famous scenic spot in Jinling, with open space and fresh air, more than 20 miles from the city.) However, it is estimated that the preparation plan will take one year to realize, because it requires a lot of effort in surveying and mapping, and digging and measuring waterways is a prerequisite. If the water source is suitable, it will be connected to the tap water. If the water source has problems, the overall plan will be affected. Mr. Xu and Minister Wang, Commissioner Li, President Luo, etc. also learned about the latest situation of Russian school architecture. They returned to the city in the afternoon. On the 28th, they also visited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. On the 29th, they will visit schools and other scenic spots.

<h3>The Puppet Organization Xing'an General Office Changes the Education Policy of All Manchurian and Mongolian People</h3>
<p>Instructed by the Japanese to abolish the reading of Chinese</p>
<p>Separate Mongolian textbooks will be issued</p>
<p>(Changchun News from the Northeast President) The Japanese invaders in the Northeast are constantly racking their brains to find ways to eliminate the national and national concepts of our youth. Regarding anesthetizing education and pro-Japanese thought, they strive to instill it quickly. This is the vicious policy actively implemented by them against the youth of our Han nationality. Recently, the Japanese have intensified their efforts and instigated the puppet Xing'an General Office to actively formulate changes in the Mongolian education policy in the entire Manchuria. Starting from July of this year as the beginning of the new year, they will first abolish the Chinese textbooks that Mongolian youth have been reading, and immediately issue Mongolian textbooks to Mongolian elementary schools throughout Manchuria. These textbooks are currently being edited quickly. The office also plans to abolish the Mongolian Normal Schools in Heilongjiang Province and Liaoning Province, and establish Xingzhuang Middle School in Wuzimiao on the Taomeng Line as the highest institution of learning for Mongolians. It also plans to establish dozens of elementary schools in various densely populated areas of Mongolians. The purpose of education is to emphasize both Japanese and Mongolian languages, so that the pro-Japanese concepts of Mongolian children will become deeper day by day. From then on, our Mongolian youth will be permanently enslaved by the Japanese invaders' slavery education. As the saying goes, to destroy a country, one must first destroy its writing. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese plot against us can be said to be beyond measure.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools Not to Arbitrarily Solicit Donations from Outside</h3>
<p>Those who deliberately violate the rules will be punished</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed all private schools at all levels in this city that the bureau has repeatedly received reports that there are people in this city falsely claiming to be the Shanghai Poor Girls' School at No. 104 Lan Weiai Road, French Concession, and the Shanghai Women's Vocational School at Tianyoufang, Tangjiawan, carrying donation books and soliciting donations from stores and homes. The bureau has sent personnel to investigate and found out that No. 104 Lan Weiai Road, French Concession, is Tianyoufang, Tangjiawan. There is neither a poor girls' school nor a women's vocational school there. It is obvious that someone is using the name to collect money, which is very inappropriate. Hereafter, all schools must not arbitrarily solicit donations from outside without submitting a case to this bureau for approval. Those who deliberately violate the rules will be punished. Please comply with this order.</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<h3>Three Notable Banquets at the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>(Manila Correspondence) This time, Dr. Wang Zhengting led our national team to Manila to attend the Tenth Far Eastern Games. In order to enhance our international standing, he did not hesitate to travel through the sweltering heat and experience half a month of intense sun and rain on this southern island. Dr. Wang is a veteran of our country's diplomacy. The leaders of the Philippines are eager to hear his great theories and see his demeanor. Our overseas Chinese societies, family associations, and people who have friendships with Dr. Wang have held banquets almost every night. Because time is too short, there are often several banquets a day. The most noteworthy ones are the following grand events:</p>
<h3>(1) Dinner at the Oriental Club</h3>
<p>The hosts were our country's consulate in the Philippines and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. For the sake of international etiquette, representatives and athletes from China, Japan, and the Philippines gathered together. The club was built by the overseas Chinese themselves and is located in a quiet place with beautiful flowers and gardens. Thousands of electric lights were strung up in the flower garden and sports field, and the famous female orchestra from Manila Chinese High School was invited to help out. Ten women gathered like clouds. Originally, a long night of dancing was planned, but due to the heavy rain, the courtyard was outdoors and could not be stayed in. The whole room was so crowded that it was difficult to breathe. The guests all had a light meal and then said goodbye. Only the female swimmer was most surrounded by the crowd. The flash of the cameras made the whole place smoky. Among them, Filipinos held up Miss Yang's photo and asked her to sign it dozens of times.</p>
<h3>(2) Banquet at the Manila Hotel</h3>
<p>The host was Philippine Senate President Quezon. This was a formal representation of the Philippines, hosting representatives and athletes from China and Japan, and the etiquette was extremely grand. Quezon gave a speech at the banquet, saying that extreme nationalism can lead to danger. True patriots should not harm others to benefit themselves. He also reiterated the important purpose of holding the Far Eastern Games. Since the conference aims to promote friendship between countries, we should discard the prejudices blinded by nationalism and help each other with the true spirit of sports to develop the Far Eastern Games. Wang Zhengting, the head of our country's delegation, gave a speech after Quezon's speech, thanking Quezon for his hospitality, saying that Quezon took time out of his busy election campaign to host the reception, and this kindness should be especially appreciated. He also hoped that when the Philippines is truly independent, when Quezon is elected as the first president of the Philippines, he would have the opportunity to meet him again in Malacanang. Finally, Wang's father said that our country will do its best to maintain the spirit of friendship in the Far Eastern Games. At each Far Eastern Games, records are broken. It is hoped that even if the world record is not broken, an equal world record can be created. Finally, he raised his glass to wish the Philippines and its leader Quezon a long life. Numa Ryozo, the leader of the Japanese team, continued Wang Zhengting's speech in Japanese. Because he does not speak English, his secretary translated it into English. He used simple words to thank Quezon. Dr. Blandt, the leader of the Javanese team, stood up to thank him at the end, saying that this was the first time that the Javanese team had participated. He hoped that in the next Far Eastern Games, Java could send more athletes to attend.</p>
<h3>(3) Banquet at the Datong Club</h3>
<p>The hosts of this meeting were the Philippine General Branch of the Kuomintang, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and twenty-four other groups. The Datong Club was organized by overseas Chinese and also invited foreigners to join as members. The address is on the sixth floor of the China Banking Corporation. That night, only our country's delegation and various athletes were invited. Due to the venue, only more than 600 guests were accommodated. Those who arrived later were given seats by the hosts. Since they were all family members, the guests and hosts laughed and went away with restraint. Xue Fenshi, President of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, was the chairman. That afternoon, in the women's swimming competition, Ms. Yang Xiuqiong won two more first prizes, so her seat was listed next to Chief Representative Wang. After the lady arrived, the whole meeting became more vibrant. During the banquet, Xue Fenshi, Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, announced the purpose of the meeting, followed by a welcome speech by Wang Quansheng, and then Dr. Wang Zhengting was invited to give a speech. Mr. Wang briefly said that this time when he came to a foreign country, he did not feel that he was in a foreign country, just like he was in his own country. We are here to participate in the Far Eastern Games, and we don't care about winning or losing. The biggest purpose is not to win the championship, but to take this opportunity to promote sports. The biggest problem of the Chinese people is that people get old before their bodies get old. No matter who it is, if their physique is strong, their spirit is also strong, and they can succeed in anything they do. The strength of the country lies in the prosperity of the people. The intelligence of the Chinese people is superior to others, but when they gather together, they fail. Sports, such as ball games, are a way to develop unity and cooperation. However, there are two key elements for China to promote sports: (1) Make sports popular and let the people know about sports so that the people come to practice. In the past thirty years, China's sports have indeed made progress. In the past, let alone playing ball, even few people watched it. Now it is different. This shows that China's sports have made rapid progress in recent years, but other countries have made even more progress than us. (2) Exercise should start from an early age. The reason why Chinese sports have not progressed is that there is not enough material. Searching all over China, it is felt everywhere that it cannot be done. This kind of sport cannot be done in a short period of time. May I ask, Miss Yang (referring to Yang Xiuqiong) did not start practicing from an early age? If we are old, I am afraid that we will not even be able to walk when we are forty-five years old, so how can we practice? Therefore, I have a suggestion to the government authorities: the government should come out to promote sports. Wherever there are primary schools, there should be sports fields so that children have the opportunity to exercise regularly. Mr. Wang also said that he suggested leaving a souvenir for the overseas Chinese. It is planned that after the closing of this Far Eastern Games, our athletes will stay in the Philippines for a performance and still charge admission fees. The money earned will be kept here for safekeeping. At the same time, a suitable location will be allocated to the Philippine government for overseas Chinese to open up sports fields and set up sports equipment. I don't know if everyone agrees? (The whole audience applauded) There are many people applauding, so naturally they agree. Although the athletes have been tired for days, I believe they must be very willing. This plan can probably be drafted tomorrow. (Omitted below) According to later reports on the 22nd, there was a friendly match with the championship teams of various Philippine universities and the Santo Tomas University football team. One reason was the heavy rain all day, and the other was the opposition from overseas Chinese leaders. If we win, there is no glory, and if we fail, we will lose our reputation. Therefore, it was suspended. (Yan Wenchun)</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting, Head of the Far Eastern Games, Went to Beijing Yesterday to Report to the Central Government on Japan's Collusion with the Philippines and the Illegal Dissolution of the Far Eastern Games and to Discuss Countermeasures | North China Athletes Leave Shanghai and Return North |</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Zhengting, the head of our country's delegation to the 10th Far Eastern Games, returned to Shanghai by boat on the Jackson President the day before yesterday with all the athletes and received a warm welcome from all sectors of the city. It is known that Mr. Wang took the overnight train to Beijing last night to report to the central authorities on the illegal dissolution of the Far Eastern Games by Japan's collusion with the Philippines with a small number of members and to discuss countermeasures. More than 80 athletes from North China took the Shanghai-Beijing train from Shanghai at 4 p.m. yesterday, led by head coach John Ma.</p>
<h3>Zhu Kuan Retains the Honor of Ever Victorious in the Shanghai Open Handball Singles</h3>
<p>The Match with Mr. Bao Some Days Ago Was Not Valid</p>
<p>Organizers Claim that the Arrangement Was Wrong</p>
<p>The singles match between Zhu Kuan and Bao Shanli in the first Shanghai Open Handball Tournament was recently declared by important officials of the YMCA, the organizer, to be an error in arrangement and fundamentally invalid. It is not worth considering who won or lost. Mr. Keckling will first fight against Bao Shanli, and the winner will then compete with Zhu Kuan for the championship.</p>
<h3>Grass Tennis League Begins Today | Results of the Aquatic School Sports Meet</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grass Tennis Club Group A League is scheduled to open at 5 p.m. today. However, the match between the China Tennis Club and the Xieqiao General Association has been postponed for some reason, and the date has not been determined. The other three games are: the Inner and Outer Factories at the North Grass, the Portuguese at the South Grass, and the Citibank at the Japanese Club. The French Chamber of Commerce has a bye.</p>
<h3>Ms. Yang Xiuqiong, Who Wins Glory for the Country, Yan Wenchun Shifts the Gaze of American and Filipino Women, Considering Her the Standard of Eastern Beauty</h3>
<p>— Yan Wenchun</p>
<p>(Manila Correspondence) Women's swimming in the Far Eastern Games has greatly raised eyebrows for our country and won a lot of face. However, if you want to remember the triumph when you win, you must first remember the humiliation when you fail.</p>
<h3>It is Extremely Difficult to Endure Being Mocked in Person</h3>
<p>In ball games, if there are occasional failures, the audience still does not dare to mock. The most difficult thing is racing and swimming. Others take the lead, and I am the only one behind, and perhaps the distance is too far. The audience's applause and laughter are not to urge, and perhaps they shout the name of the country to mock it. Therefore, few overseas Chinese attend track and field competitions, because they cannot stand the cold ridicule and ridicule of the Filipinos.</p>
<h3>The National Flag Flies and the National Anthem is Melodious</h3>
<p>At this conference, every facility is based on the methods of the World Games. The athletes who win the championship in each country stand on the character platform with the second and third place winners. The military police play the national anthem of the winning country and hang its national flag on the flagpole to show the solemnity of the victory. The entire audience stood quietly and listened, and the cameras competed to take pictures of their shadows. In the track and field arena, only the national flags of Japan and the Philippines can be seen fluttering, and only the national anthems of Japan and the Philippines can be heard melodiously. The honor and disgrace of the nation are divided.</p>
<h3>China Won All Women's Swimming Events</h3>
<p>The fame of the mermaid has been published in Chinese and foreign newspapers for a long time. On the day of women's swimming, the audience was even more enthusiastic. Even the old couple of General Aquino, the provisional president during the revolution, also came to watch the competition. As a result, Ms. Yang won three first prizes, and American and Filipino women also cheered loudly, "Miss China" without end.</p>
<h3>The National Flag and National Anthem Raise Eyebrows</h3>
<p>Finally, our country's national flag also began to fly on the flagpole, and our country's national anthem also came out melodiously in the military police band. The overseas Chinese audience were all happy and smiling along the way back.</p>
<h3>Obtained the Highest Individual Score</h3>
<p>Ms. Yang participated in the women's swimming competition this year and scored a total of 15 points in four events, which is the highest individual score in the Far Eastern Games. It is a pity that it was a performance and was not included in the competition record. It is a pity. Also, Ms. Yang said that she is willing to be a world swimmer. Her spirit is worthy of admiration.</p>

<h3>Labor Football: Toothbrush vs. Postal Workers in the Finals Today</h3>
<p>At 5:30 p.m. at the Football Field</p>
<p>The first citywide workers' sports games football championship competition hosted by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has a total of eleven participating teams this year. Up to now, the teams that have won the right to the finals are the Postal Workers and the Toothbrush teams. The final is scheduled to be held at 5:30 p.m. today at the China Football Field to determine who will win the championship. According to reports, the Gongguang team, formerly formed by the Yixin and Liangxinji toothbrush factories of the toothbrush union team, is quite prestigious among amateur teams in the Hunan area, while the football skills of the postal workers team are still acceptable, but they rarely have the opportunity to practice at ordinary times, and it seems that they are not as skilled in training as the toothbrush team (ie, Gongguang). When the two heroes compete, it is unknown who will win. In order to be cautious, the association has specially invited Mr. Chen Jixiang to perform the referee duties and Mr. Rui Jinxian and Mr. Ding Shunbao to serve as linesmen. Attached below are the lineups of the two teams today:</p>
<p>Postal Workers</p>
<p>Xu Xin</p>
<p>Xu Duoshu, Zhu Ping, Liu Menggen, Shen Wenxu, Hu Guisen, Sun Huifang, Zhuang Xiude, Zhang Hong, Zheng Wenkui, Tang Shouxian (Reserves) Zhang Shilin, Bao Boyu, Gui Qinxia Toothbrush</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) Receiving the Emperor</p>
<p>Wherever the Empress Dowager went, she always had to take her orchestra with her; although this custom certainly had many inconveniences and uneconomical aspects, and could even lead to various difficulties, she ignored them all! Fortunately, no matter what difficulties arose, there would always be people to take care of them, and she would never be disturbed herself. Among the various miscellaneous tasks that Qing Shan and I were responsible for, this was always one of them. I also had a great interest in the Empress Dowager's orchestra, and I always watched and listened to them very carefully. Whenever I had the opportunity, I would often approach them. Therefore, I not only had a deep understanding of the name and skills of each musician, but I could also play any of the instruments to a limited extent, enough to avoid mistakes, but of course I would not dare to say that I was proficient.</p>
<p>Among the instruments used by this orchestra, some were certainly very old. Most of them had a very pleasant, but not very reliable history. Anyone who could use these instruments probably knew this. Speaking of this, I must again praise the breadth of knowledge of the Empress Dowager. Ordinary people might mistakenly think that she was an old woman with very narrow views, because it was very difficult for her to go outside; however, the opposite was true, and what she knew was really no less than ordinary people. For example, she told me about the origins and legends of those ancient musical instruments.</p>
<p>Even in her bedroom or other parts of the inner court, she never let those musicians leave easily; she had taken them to Jehol, and this time she had taken them to Fengtian. (46)</p>
<h3>Yellow Croaker</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Yellow croaker, also known as spring fish, is the most common "dish to think of" in every family in the coastal provinces of the southeast in spring and summer, because it is cheap and delicious. Especially from the beginning of summer, it becomes even more popular with the common people.</p>
<p>Yellow croaker can be divided into small yellow croaker and large yellow croaker. This is based on the form. It can also be divided into northern and southern varieties depending on the place of origin. But those divided into northern and southern varieties are all salted. Fresh yellow croaker is only divided by size, not by north and south. In Shanghai, northern salted yellow croaker is very valuable. It is said that when fishing boats leave from various ports in North China, such as Yingkou and Tanggu, the boats are empty. They fish all the way south, and what they catch is dried on the boat. By the time they reach the Wusongkou, they have become very good salted yellow croaker, because the seawater originally contains a large amount of salt.</p>
<p>Because the fresh and delicious taste of northern salted yellow croaker is very popular, fishermen in the South China Sea pickle fresh yellow croaker to pass it off as northern yellow croaker. But the old gourmets can tell the difference between naturally salted and artificially salted with one bite.</p>
<p>The belly of small yellow croaker is attached with parasites, shaped like one or two-inch long threads. In early spring, there are not many. The hotter the weather, the more parasites there are. A few years ago, there was a rumor that poisonous worms were found in the belly of small yellow croaker. But according to my experience of eating yellow croaker, these parasites, after being cooked, have no impact on human health. Moreover, the place where these worms parasitize is the stomach of the yellow croaker, not the muscle, so it is not absolutely impossible to cut them out. Therefore, I think everyone does not need to give up eating for fear of choking.</p>
<h3>The Dissection of Corpses</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dejing</p>
<p>When walking past the front of the anatomical hall, one can smell a strong odor of disinfectant. Some students cover their noses and avoid it quickly, while others, driven by curiosity, peer inside through the gaps in the windows. What they see are yellowish-brown corpses lying naked on the tables, being carefully dissected with knives and hooks by university students in white coats. Some have already revealed the ribs of their upper bodies, while others have strips of flesh hanging from their arms. The sight is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>If such a situation were seen by old-fashioned scholars, they would sigh even more at the decline of morality, even playing with the dead. In fact, after a person dies, they are an ignorant and unconscious body, not the same as braised birds for people to feast on and specimens of fish and insects for people to admire? Although humans are known as the spirit of all things, blessed by nature, they must strive for fame and fortune in life, glorify their ancestors and benefit their descendants, and after death they must be properly dressed and buried in a grand coffin. But the facts now tell us that so-called civilization is just a mask. The most civilized Europeans and Americans are even more vicious, wanting to kill people every day, the more the better. Therefore, those who are dominated all die on the battlefield, their bones exposed in the wilderness. Looking back at our China, we suffer from internal and external troubles every year, and the people live in poverty. After death, they cannot even get a thin coffin and are devoured by foxes and wild dogs. Are these people more blessed or beneficial than those who are dissected after death to gain knowledge to save humanity?</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p>
<p>Returning East, Heartbroken, He Marks Himself with Elecampane</p>
<p>Hearing, They Swear Allegiance Together</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang folded his arms around his chest, tapping his toes repeatedly, and muttered, "The enemy is in front, don't look back at home." As he was muttering this, suddenly a hand gently patted him on the back. When he turned around, it was Battalion Commander Bao Fang. He first smiled and said, "What's wrong? Old Zhao, do you miss home?" Ziqiang smiled and said, "I dare not! I dare not!" Bao Fang held his hand and said, "The situation has been very tense these past few days. We are relying on our battalion to guard Ping'an Village, and guarding Ping'an Village is guarding the first pass of the mouth. This responsibility is very important. Now that we have reached this point, there is nothing else to say, just to repay the country with a heart full of enthusiasm." When Ziqiang heard him say this, he naturally calmed down and replied with a "yes." Bao Fang said, "Since the day I came to Ping'an Village, I have said that there should be a brigade guarding this place. Even if there are fewer, there should be a regiment, but now there is only a battalion. I might as well tell you the truth now, it is impossible to send more people from the mouth. Because we mobilized troops quickly, the enemy attacked quickly. The Chinese always want to muddle through public affairs, thinking that as long as the enemy does not attack, and this breath slows down, they can avoid war. But now that we have reached this situation, can people not attack? Airplanes don't matter, I don't think they have much power, and we have been through airplane battles. But one thing, the enemy's tanks are annoying. If they have two or three of those things to cover the infantry's attack, it will be troublesome. I have already sent several reports to the regimental commander, and we must have several anti-aircraft guns. The regimental commander replied that the superiors have already agreed. When can the anti-aircraft guns be allocated, that is hard to say. To be honest, let's do our thing, and don't care what the superiors do." Ziqiang said, "With the battalion commander guiding us, we are determined to defend Ping'an Village to the death. When the critical moment comes, I think reinforcements will definitely come."

<h3>Deceptive Talk</h3>

<h3>Adventures on the Crossroads</h3>
<p>— Yizhen</p>
<p>At the tram station, a row of cars was parked on the right, like a continuous stream.</p>
<p>Thinking of going to the Old West Gate, the tram just wouldn't come. I got annoyed and said, "Let's go! We have legs! What are we waiting for?" I dragged Lao Ding, who was staring at a woman across the street! He didn't hear me as he was walking. So I said with a smile:</p>
<p>"She's shy, let's go;"</p>
<p>Just as I squeezed past the front of the parked cars, as I started walking forward.</p>
<p>"Hey! Car!" Lao Ding pulled me back, a gray car drove past like a snake.</p>
<p>"Ah!" I exclaimed, my heart jumping with panic as if it had been pulled away by the car. I lowered my head and noticed that my shoes were covered with yellow dust. The shadow of this dust resembled a bloody, mangled corpse, lying silently on the road.</p>
<p>"Ding! I almost said goodbye to you forever!" After a while, I blurted out these words. A smile appeared on my face, I knew it was a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Haha:::" Lao Ding laughed, he was laughing at my stupidity! Indeed, I was too foolish, ah! A woman over there was also laughing at me.</p>
<p>"Haha:::" I wiped the sweat from my forehead, stamped my feet a few times on the asphalt road, which was also a way of avenging the fright just now. I forced a smile.</p>
<h3>The World of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Tianhu</p>
<p>Shanghai is a world for officials and dignitaries; a world for wealthy merchants and tycoons; a world for young masters and young ladies; a world for famous scholars and talented men; a world for actors and entertainers; a world for mistresses; a world for human flesh; apart from the above, the rest belong to the foreigners; as for those who have no share, they will always have no share.</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3>Old Stories of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>I am not yet forty, so I have not witnessed or heard of the events of the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the late Qing Dynasty, and I dare not collect hearsay and claim it as my own work. I will just extract and record here some of the things I have personally experienced in the past thirty years that have some value. I call it "Old Stories," but it is not really old, just to distinguish it from today's modern trends.</p>
<p>The rickshaws of the past had bodies painted black and wheels with iron rims. The rickshaws made a rattling sound as they passed, which was very noisy. They were commonly called "Eastern cars" because they were imitated from our eastern neighbors. After rubber wheels were used, the rickshaw bodies were also painted yellow, so they were commonly called "yellow package cars." The term "Eastern car" also became a thing of the past.</p>
<p>From the Sanyangjing Bridge to the Shiliupu, rickshaw drivers drove emaciated horses, pulled dilapidated carts, and solicited passengers. Each trip cost thirty copper coins. The carts departed when there were five passengers, with four people sitting inside the cart and one person sitting next to the driver. At that time, they were called "wild chicken carriages." The name was not elegant. If it were today, it would definitely be called "public carriage."</p>
<p>Trams began running in Shanghai around the end of the Guangxu period. The first section to operate was from the Old Garbage Bridge to the Waiyangjing Bridge, divided into two stops. The Old Garbage Bridge to the Risheng Building was one stop, and the Risheng Building to the Waiyangjing Bridge was another stop. One stop cost three copper coins, and two stops cost only five coins.</p>
<p>At that time, there were three rivers in Shanghai, all running horizontally from east to west.</p>
<p>(1) Suzhou River, which was the boundary between the British and American concessions (in the past, everything north of the Suzhou River was called the concession). It still exists today.</p>
<p>(2) Yangjingbang, which was the boundary between the British and French concessions. It has now been filled in and is now known as Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>(3) Chenghangbang, which was the boundary between the Chinese and French concessions. It has also been filled in and is now known as Min'guo Road and Zhonghua Road.</p>
<p>In August of the thirtieth year of Guangxu (whether this is accurate is unclear, but it is not far off), Shanghai experienced a major flood. The water was two feet deep on the ground, and cars could not travel. The objects in the rooms were all stained with water. Children learned to swim in the streets. Chamber pots and wooden objects floated on the roads everywhere, which was quite a sight.</p>
<p>The first modern-style theater in Shanghai was the Xin Wu Tai (New Stage), initially located in Shiliupu. The manager was Shen Manyun (deceased), who had a considerable revolutionary history and worked with Chen Qimei. At that time, Pan Yueqiao, Xia Yueshan, and Xia Yuerun were all performing together, but now they are all gone.</p>
<p>The earliest amusement park in Shanghai was the Lou Wai Lou on the roof of the Xin Xin Wu Tai (New New Stage) (formerly the site of the Old Great Toad Stage, now demolished). In addition to concave and convex mirrors and telescopes, there were also magic shows and Suzhou opera. The park was quite small. However, business was booming, and visitors flocked to it, showing that scarcity makes things valuable. After Huang Chujiu founded the New World, with its complete facilities and lively atmosphere, the Lou Wai Lou was eliminated. At the Qing Lian Ge on the Four Horse Road, few Shanghai people did not know its name. The upper floor was a teahouse, and the lower floor was a small-scale amusement park. There were billiard tables, hand-cranked movie machines, and punching machines, which attracted people from the lower classes. At that time, a Japanese man rented a storefront and performed magic, such as tightrope walking, which also attracted spectators.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, whenever we sat in teahouses or restaurants, we would see Japanese people selling Jin Tan and other items to customers. Both men and women did this. In fact, what they sold was not just Jin Tan and other medicines, but also aphrodisiacs, anti-poison devices, etc. The business was quite good. In the past ten years, we have not seen these people anymore.</p>
<p>At that time, the spring and autumn races at the racecourse attracted many Chinese people. People from the surrounding towns and cities came to Shanghai to watch the races, regarding it as a lively event. Poor people laid out chairs and planks outside the racecourse fence to create high platforms, charging each person twenty or thirty copper coins for a view. As for princes, nobles, and wealthy merchants, they often took famous prostitutes in steel-wheeled horse-drawn carriages, called Hansome Cabs, along Nanjing Road, regarding it as a grand gesture.</p>
<p>Old things come up again and again, and I cannot remember them all. I am afraid that I will use up all the ink, so I will end it here.</p>

<h3>A Record of a Martyr of the May 30th Movement</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>When I was studying in elementary school, listening to the teacher talk about the Opium War and the invasion of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance, I saw many classmates clenching their small fists to express their anger. One of them was He Jun Bingyi, who shed blood on Nanjing Road in 1925. The school was in the Fire God Temple in Qingliu Town, Xinfan County, Sichuan, but Bingyi and I were both from the countryside. To resist the insults of the hooligan children in the town, we were united. The most annoying thing about those little guys on the street was that they liked to say things that were offensive in front of you, and they would often use outrageous language like men treating women. Therefore, Bingyi and I had to become children who liked to fight. Now, when I recall this childhood companion, the brave appearance of smiling even with swollen eyes clearly appears before me.</p>
<p>Bingyi and his younger brother Bingjun were both in my third-grade classroom. Seeing that he was more diligent than others and made progress very quickly, the teacher promoted him to the fourth grade, but during self-study, he was still with us. Once, when solving a difficult multiplication and division problem, everyone failed on the blackboard. As a result, many small heads were lowered in the teacher's complaints. At this time, Bingyi had just returned from class in the fourth-grade classroom, and the teacher called him to the podium to practice, and he immediately "succeeded in one fell swoop." From then on, the third-grade children regarded him as an "amazing little guy."</p>
<p>He lived in the countryside to the west, while I was in the opposite east, so I was not very clear about his family situation, but I knew that he had a very strict and terrifying grandmother. Sometimes, when we came out of school and played in the street, we would hear Bingyi suddenly alertly shout to his younger brother:</p>
<p>"Oh, let's go, let's go, Grandma is going to scold us again!"</p>
<p>At that time, his father was studying law and politics, which we learned from a letter from Chengdu entrusting the teacher to supervise his son's studies. At the same time, it aroused the surprise of our young minds: Why is the father still studying like the son? It would be interesting to be in the same school. Later, his family moved to Pengxian County, and we did not meet or communicate. It was not until I was studying at Chengdu Normal School that I learned that he was studying at the Higher Industrial School. I wanted to meet him, but I did not have the courage because I felt a kind of shame in my heart, feeling that he was making progress too fast and had surpassed me by several years in school. However, later he found out about me and took the initiative to run over to meet me suddenly, with a very kind young face. However, he showed a slight skill and smoothness in communication, which did not quite match my personality. Therefore, the friendship that had once been renewed was interrupted again and became the last meeting and parting.</p>
<p>Soon, I heard that he had entered Shanghai University, and then I received the news of his martyrdom. I regretted why I had a wrong idea about this kind of person and did not meet him more often when I was in Chengdu. At the same time, I felt honored and happy in my heart that among the dozens of young companions who were angry at the foreigners, one of them had actually gone to implement it and shed the last drop of blood, although it was also mixed with sadness.</p>
<p>It has been almost ten years since he left this world, but that little face with swollen eyes still smiling is vividly reflected in my eyes, making people unable to forget it. Now the May 30th Movement is coming again, so I will move it to paper and make it a memorial.</p>
<h3>A Dream in May</h3>
<p>— Shen Chunhong</p>
<p>The dream of May has fled.</p>
<p>The sound of frogs breaks the silence of the deep night.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The remaining celestial canopy leaks light, and the hot wind from the equator pierces the secluded feelings.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Youth falls under the shade of roses, and the sunlight grabs everyone's brow.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The sadness of life passes through loneliness, and the sleepy spring grass opens its passionate eyes.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The dream of May has fled, and the sadness of the dream clings to my heart.</p>
<h3>On the Futility of Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Young people who read the Records of the Grand Historian and the Strategies of the Warring States often cannot help but have some yearnings for Su Qin and Zhang Yi. Moreover, the current world situation is somewhat like the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. As a result, they hope that they or someone can "wag their three-inch tongue" to persuade various parts of Europe, either to form alliances or to unite: ... and make China strong.</p>
<p>The affairs of the world are nothing more than that, turning back and forth, nothing more than a few moves in the old playbook. It is inevitable that heroes will be moved and heroes will be born. This motive, wanting to make China rich and strong, is itself unquestionable. This has already surpassed the authorities who only know how to greet and sing praises. It has also surpassed many traitors who are good at selling the country.</p>
<p>However, alas! What makes patriots disheartened is that the method of "using barbarians to control barbarians" is no longer useful. Barbarians understand the Chinese better than the Chinese understand themselves, and even better than the Chinese understand the barbarians or the Chinese understand themselves. As for the many methods of controlling barbarians and controlling the barbarians, such as diplomacy, intrigue, espionage, and all kinds of methods, the result is that they can only be used in the hands of the strong, but instead control China. Because the situation in ancient and modern times is different, and the feelings of high and low are also different. For example, if people eat a side of pork, there may be disputes between them, but we have never heard of any movement on the pork side. This is one reason.</p>
<p>Again, however, however, schemes and the like may have a momentary effect, but they can never achieve success. For example, the spicy and sour foods in food cannot nourish the body and have long lost their stimulation. Using a little trickery to deceive great strength, the ancients called it "inauspicious," and now it seems very dangerous. Even if it succeeds, it will eventually fail. This is based on the scheme itself, which is also unhealthy. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, many people admire Yuan Shikai, Li Hongzhang: ... all the way to Zhuge Liang, or even more admire Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Zigong, and Yan Ying. The result is very bad. If the ideal type is not high and wonderful, the limping that is learned will of course be unsuccessful. To overshadow a generation of characters, sweep away all existing authority, and make this nation strong, one should start from a high and far place.</p>
<p>The ancient strategists have gradually disappeared, and not many people study them anymore, probably because of these reasons.丨</p>
<h3>The Fire Hidden in the South</h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>丨Dedicated to friends far away under the equator who are still struggling丨</p>
<p>At the age of nineteen, I was forced by the pressures of life to drift in the southern wilderness.</p>
<p>Because I had been trampled by the raging waves of humanity, my weak heart was covered with wounds. The disillusionment of hope for the future, the infinite desire for the future, and the entanglement of the layers of the net of life, created a contradictory and complex intricate mood in me.</p>
<p>"Go to Nanyang!" I said to myself.</p>
<p>So, I climbed up the coast of Singapore from the crowded crowd to see the colonial imperialism of this colony. A month later, I transferred from Singapore to Sumatra to taste the spicy taste of the Dutch little empire. For five years, I kept turning around in the British and Dutch territories, enjoying the hard work of the coconut breeze and palm rain, and I was also accustomed to climbing through the desolate forests and paths. Since I personally enjoyed the abusive reward of imperialism, I also watched the overseas Chinese groan in pain under the iron fist of "economic downturn." The cannons of the January 28th Incident burned the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese, and the signing of the armistice also aroused the anger of the overseas Chinese. I saw batches of unemployed overseas Chinese being deported back home, and I also saw sad laborers swallowing tears and drinking blood. For five years, my life has floated and sunk with the ups and downs of the overseas Chinese, and I have deeply breathed the pulse of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The breath of the red soil of the South still makes me unforgettable, and the wild fire of the wilderness is still visible. There have been tears from wandering farmers and workers dripping beside me, and I have also seen young students who were abandoned by the revolution shedding tears by the sea. All the heartbreaking stories made me dare not listen again, and all the tragic scenes made me dare not witness them.</p>
<p>I have also spent my youthful energy in the southern wilderness, dripping my hot tears, and pouring out my passion, ... I love the foolish and simple lower-class compatriots there, and I love my lively and healthy children even more. I love the fledgling culture of the overseas Chinese community, and I also love the love of compatriots among the overseas Chinese. I admire the hard work and diligence of the overseas Chinese, and I also praise them for the blood and sweat they have shed for themselves. I ___examination, I am in that place hiding the evil holes under civilization.</p>
<p>However, being abandoned by the huge waves of "economic downturn" and oppressed by imperialism at the same time, I returned with the exiled overseas Chinese laborers. I shed my painful tears at the time of parting, and I held a volcano-like anger.</p>
<p>The five years of wandering in the southern wilderness can be considered over. I weave these painful blood and tears into my heart, and I weave them into words. I shout to the people of the country! I also shout to the world!</p>
<p>However, my strength is so weak, and my shout seems to be in vain. I look up to the sky, the South is still full of the tears of the overseas Chinese; they are looking forward to rescue, and they also hope for drastic changes. When will the bright era come? When will there be a time for the oppressed to raise their heads?</p>
<p>The hardworking overseas Chinese are joining hands and feet to create a bright future! Strive for a free world!</p>
<p>I sincerely wish them well. I encourage them.</p>
<h3>The Song of the May Thirtieth Movement</h3>
<h3>Jumping Ladder (3)</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>"In a moment, what will become of our fate?" A middle-aged man asked.</p>
<p>"I see it clearly; we're preparing to tighten our belts and endure hunger this year. Even if the rent is reduced a bit, how can we fill this big hole? How could those well-fed and well-clothed people devise a plan for us? Is it that farmers are destined to suffer for a lifetime?" A man with slightly graying whiskers said despondently.</p>
<p>"My son has simply wild ideas. He says they will take all the!!" The long-bearded old man said, lowering his voice as if wary of something, "Take all the land, and everyone poor will get a share, so that no one has to endure hunger anymore:::" But, I didn't let him continue.</p>
<p>Driven by something, Ah Mei hesitantly stood up and quietly walked to the outside of the main room. Her feet stopped by conflicting thoughts. Inside, the monotonous voice of a fat man broke her train of thought.</p>
<p>"I've discussed with the village elders several times to compensate for this loss!!"</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and continued, "Isn't 'Farmers' Relief Association' a very nice name? It only charges four percent interest and requires both principal and interest to be repaid within a year::: This is a very good business to do, but unfortunately, I don't have much capital! My son in the city丨丨 is at the Faculty of Law, about to graduate, and he needs money again, alas:::"</p>
<p>Ah Mei resolutely took two steps forward, standing there just about to tell the master that several people were waiting for him outside the door, when a burst of rude male voices arose behind her. She turned around, and four men stood behind her. Surprise caused her to lower her head and run inside. The men's bargaining voices rose behind her.</p>
<p>Afterward, Old Master Huang roared and scolded:</p>
<p>"You're throwing money out the door! You really have the character of a slave呵::: It's not like you're having an affair with those old monkeys, so why are you helping them?"</p>
<p>Ah Mei's eyes stared blankly at the white sky, and from the corners of her sorrowful mouth came clear words, breaking through the deafening sound of the masters' shouts and curses.</p>
<p>"I didn't let them in!"</p>
<p>The masters dealt with her with forceful means, subduing Ah Mei, who stood as straight as a sunflower under the sun. Finally, lines appeared on the mistress's face, and she said fiercely:</p>
<p>"I will definitely marry you off to a very poor farming family::: From now on, don't even think about freely coming and going! There are no good outcomes for restless people."</p>
<p>Ah Mei's temperament became stubborn like a tree rooted in a dark corner. Her eyes were grayer and more sinister and dull than before. The master's loud shouting often caused a kind of startle in her sluggish body.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't someone take me away?" She said one day to the woman who ground flour for the master.</p>
<p>"Isn't it good to have food to eat here? You just need to relax your mind; any place is fine to drift around. How can a country person leave food?" The woman emphasized the last word, as if it had once been soaked in the bitter sweat of life, and she was about to vent her distorted hatred at any moment. However, the other party shook her head.</p>
<p>At nineteen years old, Ah Mei went to her strange in-laws' home in the south of the village, her slender body accompanied by new, transforming surprise and timidity.</p>
<p>Her mother-in-law's refined and habitually gentle gaze brought Ah Mei a moment of secret joy.</p>
<p>"Although your in-laws' home is poor, it still has two or three mu of land. Since ancient times, starting a family depends on diligence and thrift!" The mother-in-law taught her daughter-in-law, "You must understand a man's temper; don't let him turn into a wolf:::" Her slightly yellow eyes, shining with shrewdness, made Ah Mei's heart beat anxiously. She held her curious feelings and lived nervously in terrible premonition.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Gold Market Continues to be Stable, | Resulting in Another Increase of $1.60 |</h3>

<h3>The Call Money Market Gradually Increases | Clearing Still Feels Smooth |</h3>
<p>Various transactions in yesterday's market felt quite complicated, and after the foreign call market price increased a few days ago, it increased another two points yesterday, calculated at nine points for both the morning and afternoon markets. However, because the supply of 划头 transactions was abundant, the supply and demand could not be properly adjusted, and it remained a white 划头 throughout. This clearly shows the decline of the social state, and financial circulation is still not an easy matter. Call money transactions in the early market were over 5 million for transfers and new transactions, over 200,000 in the afternoon market, and over 500,000 in the small general meeting. Bank clearing was still relatively smooth. Although the numbers were not very strong, the procedures felt extremely trivial. Foreign banks cleared over 2 million in bills, over 3.9 million in various goods, foreign exchange, advances, and miscellaneous items, over 1.7 million in settlement, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 600,000 in warehouse release.

<h3>Jiang Jiao Stabilizes, Guangdong Jiao Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of small Jiangnan silver dollars in the early market originally showed an upward trend, calculated at $839.

<h3>Securities: Overview of the May Bond Delivery</h3>
<p>Auction of July futures added today</p>
<p>Yesterday, May 29th, was the delivery date for the May futures of the Chinese Securities Exchange. The total delivery amount was 38,540,000. After the various brokers mutually cleared accounts between long and short positions, the number of self-deliveries was 30,315,000. Only 8,225,000 yuan were delivered at the exchange. Although there are no accurate statistics for off-exchange deliveries by other brokers, the number is likely to be very large. After the May futures were listed on March 30, the market was very strong, with new high prices found every day. On April 2, the highest price for troop reduction bonds was $73.60, and the highest price for salt tax bonds was $55.70. After that, the market gradually eased. On April 9, the North China issue suddenly became serious, and northern merchants sold frantically, causing the market price to plummet. The lowest price for troop reduction bonds was $70.03. On April 28, the international atmosphere was serious, and the market price was chaotic. The price rose and fell three times a day, and the lowest price for salt tax bonds was $52. The price difference between the highest and lowest prices was only a few dollars. This was a general overview of the situation in April, with very large fluctuations. After entering May, the market suddenly became calm, gradually becoming stagnant and dull. There were no major changes throughout the month, and the market was calm, which was unprecedented. Moreover, before the delivery in April and May, there were no signs of squeezing long or short positions, which was very different from previous situations. In terms of the environment, initially, the arrogant statements of Japan and the serious international atmosphere kept the market price depressed. After Japan softened its stance, the intensive international meetings stopped, and the market price stabilized. Issues such as the opening of traffic and postal services were no longer significant. Transactions were most numerous in 96 bonds, and transactions in the 22nd Year Customs bonds also gradually became active. Therefore, transactions in salt tax bonds gradually decreased. The delivery, clearing, and total transaction amounts for the May futures are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reports that yesterday (28th), the stock market, bonds, and small exchanges of the New York Stock Exchange all rose due to soaring grains, and market sentiment improved for securities. However, the market situation was still dull, which some attributed to thin trading. Grains soared due to drought. Also, the New York agent of this company reports that the (securities) market lacked excitement and the market atmosphere was still firm. (Wheat) continued to be drought-stricken, and public industries have started buying, with no hope of relief. News from the fields was alarming. (Cotton) lacked impetus, but because grains were firm and high, the flat prices in major markets were higher than in New York. (Silver) The market was stagnant with no news. The total trading volume for the day was 610,000 shares. The Dow Jones indexes are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Standard Yarn Peak at 179.9</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm and rising sharply. The reasons for the increase are briefly described below: (1) The 2,569 bales of 20-count Caihua yarn in the exchange's warehouse were all sold to speculators. (2) Recently, Japanese yarn prices have been high, and the prices of Dongyang's Three Products yarn are relatively large. Today, the Shenxin Factory sold 100 bales of 8-count and 10-count coarse yarn to the Dongyang gang for transportation and export, but the prices have not been announced. At the same time, raw cotton is rising daily. With these two major reasons, the buying trend has suddenly intensified, and the market has soared.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Rises</h3>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning. Due to mixed rises and falls in U.S. cotton, there was a lack of sellers in the market, and each month rose slightly by 1 to 2 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that Caihua yarn in the market was sold to speculators, short positions were covered, and long positions were added, rising by $1.20 to $3.00. Statistics of total transactions for the day totaled 16,404 bales. It was found that Daji sold 600 bales, Yuanda 650 bales, Dafeng 500 bales, Tongfu 550 bales, Chunji 500 bales, Yukang 400 bales, Changfeng 950 bales, Gengfeng 1,300 bales, Yicheng 900 bales, and Yichang 1,000 bales.

<p>Total 203,450</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Still Good</h3>

<p>Guangdong 420 Xiamen 10 Changsha 170 Luzhou 20 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Northern Gang 10</p>
<p>Inland 550 ○Henan 153 Datong 10 Shantou 140 Wenzhou 55</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Peak at 45.45</h3>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but overseas cotton markets saw mixed rises and falls. The local market was extremely firm, and buyers' intentions were quite strong. Japanese merchants also purchased swaps. In the afternoon, the yarn market trended firm, and the cotton market also rose accordingly. However, there is a lack of confidence in the future situation. In general, prices are too high, and factories are losing too much money.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Rises Again</h3>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was very firm. Later, long positions released the near month and moved into the far month, and the market price eased again, with each month rising and falling by 5 points. In the afternoon, with the yarn market trending up, the cotton market was even tighter, and each month rose by 3, 4, and 5 jiao. Statistics of total transactions for the day totaled 100,400 dan. It was found that Yukang sold 4,600 dan, Dachang 1,600 dan, Yuanda 3,500 dan, Shenchang 1,800 dan, Hongchang 8,400 dan, Gengfeng 1,000 dan, Shenji 1,400 dan, Yifeng 3,200 dan, and Hengyi 1,500 dan.

<p>Total 742,100</p>
<h3>Factory Needs Normal</h3>
<p>The current cotton sales market remains dull. The source is estimated at 50 bales of Yao flower, and 710 bales of Tong flower. The current flower prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Flower: 44.00 Hengfeng Factory imports 2,000 bales, immediate delivery to the factory</p>

<h3>Fluctuating American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of American cotton initially decreased due to foreign merchants selling, then strengthened due to buying by fellow traders, and finally declined again due to some long positions being closed. As a result, the spot price remained unchanged, while futures rose and fell by one or two points. Indian cotton strengthened due to speculators buying new White Luo Creek cotton. As a result, Pingguo Pingguo merchants rose by 2 rupees and 2.5 jiao, Aolà rose by 1.5 rupees, and White Luo Creek rose by 1 rupee and 3.75 jiao. British cotton futures rose by 6 to 8 points. Original telegram recorded below (telegram of the 28th):</p>
<p>American Cotton compared to previous day in national currency British Cotton compared to previous day in national currency</p>

<h3>Futures Flour and Wheat Rise Consistently</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened, prices for all months rebounded consistently. Because foreign wheat surged by 5 points, the larger ones reached 1.67 yuan. Those outside the industry who feared the impact of imported foreign flour and wheat were reassured, and some speculators slightly inquired. Scattered factories released some stock, but large factories remained unchanged. However, from next month onwards, the margin deposit will remain the same, and warehouse receipts will be substituted for certification, which may result in some activity. However, customers and short covering paid attention to the long-term market, so the long-term gradually rose. The afternoon was even better. At the close, August and September were both up 1.75 points, October and November were both up 1 point, while this month had fluctuations because there were no customers taking delivery this month.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices for near and far months rose consistently. Because foreign telegrams reported a rise of 1.5 yuan, market sentiment improved, short positions were covered, long positions stopped selling, and floating buyers inquired again. The trend of a small market in the past few days due to clear weather was broken by the rise in foreign wheat prices. However, June did not receive much attention from all parties, and the closing price was still down by a small 4 points. July and August were both up by 3 points, and there was no comparison for October. The spot wheat arrival and sales were balanced. The entire market was handled by Fuxin, selling 20 bags of Dong wheat at prices ranging from 3 yuan to 2.967 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Continues Down a Small Corner</h3>
<p>丨Hopes for a Turnaround in the Aftermarket丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market situation continued to be strong in the early stages. Speculators, seeing that the market was temporarily not easy to rise again, mostly sought to sell along with the market, so the market price softened immediately after opening and fell by more than one corner. After the price decreased slightly, the local and Fujian provinces began to buy. The local market was more active, buying 2,500 bags, and Fuzhou and other places each bought more than 1,000 bags. However, the prices were still flat and weak compared to the previous market. High-quality goods were priced at a slightly lower corner. Considering the current inventory situation, it is difficult for the market to turn around in the short term. However, the early-stage arrivals will gradually decrease, and the demand in Fujian and Zhejiang is still strong. Once sales become smooth again, the market can easily turn around.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Rapeseed Opens at Three Taels, Nine Qian and a Half</h3>
<p>Suzhou rapeseed opened with 500 bags, for delivery in the first half of June. The price was three taels, nine qian and a half. According to foreign firm regulations, it is still difficult to see a firm market at the moment. We must wait for the new crop to appear to determine the short and long term. The new crop is expected to be available in ten days or so. Soybean cake has not yet resolved the issue of increased taxes in Shantou, so the spot goods are only moving in Wenzhou and other inland areas. Moreover, the Shantou merchants are returning goods, causing the market to remain flat and soft. Futures are still being inquired about by Shantou merchants, and the market is rising. Yesterday, 20,000 pieces of Sipaibing cake for delivery in the first half of June were traded. The price opened at 1.23 yuan, which was newly sold by Wuxi Hengde and Dade.</p>
<p>North-South Goods</p>
<h3>New Tree Fungus Has Arrived in Hankou</h3>
<p>According to Hankou news, a small amount of new tree fungus has arrived, priced at 56 taels and 6 qian, plus all external expenses, estimated to be around 93 yuan in Shanghai. Because the quantity is small, local firms have not yet handled it. It is expected that the market will ease when more arrives later. Yesterday, the market was booming. Small packages of Aviation Brand tree fungus sold for 85 or 86 packages, and miscellaneous brands were slightly cheaper. The trend is tight and strong.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Coarse Granulated White Sugar Shows Slight Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market showed a weak trend due to sluggish sales. The guild's listed prices for spot 24 coarse granulated white sugar were 20.6 yuan, 3-warehouse goods were 20.7 yuan, and transit goods were 6.75 yuan, all showing slight declines. There were also few transactions for Dutch Red and Taikoo sugar. The higher price for our factory's No. 1 fine white sugar was still 19.2 yuan, followed by 19.0 yuan to 19.1 yuan. Considering the land price and inventory, domestic Chaoqing sugar will definitely continue to rise, but recent sales have not been smooth. The opening price is temporarily fixed, and there are also few transactions. Yesterday, only a few hundred bags were offered. The prices were 12.2 yuan for Huanggang Qing, 11.9 yuan to 8 qian for the second grade, and 11.1 yuan for the second Zhuang Longgang Qing, and 2 jiao for the higher ones. According to the Xiamen factory's telegram yesterday, Wufu Standard White Crystal will be shipped to Shanghai this Friday.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>New Lead Wire Sells Most Actively in Fujian</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Fujian merchants bought new lead wire very actively, so more than 1,000 dan of goods were sold. Although the various gangs along the Yangtze River and inland rivers also had transactions, the number was small. The business of the northern gangs has been less inquired about due to the impact of the influx of eastern goods. Therefore, the recent market situation in Shanghai is quite quiet. The market sentiment is still strong among the various peers, so there is no major change. The market quotations are recorded below for reference (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>No. 8: 8.00 No. 14: 8.70 No. 20: 10.60</p>
<p>No. 9: 8.10 No. 15: 8.90 No. 21: 2.20</p>

<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Trades Vigorously</h3>
<p>Since a large batch of new Qimen black tea was put on the market the day before yesterday, the market has suddenly become lively. Yesterday, tea houses and major foreign firms were still making every effort to buy this type of black tea. A total of more than 3,900 boxes were traded in the entire market, and the trading was quite vigorous. The highest cloth price was marked at 210 yuan, and the situation remained strong. There were no major changes in the green tea market. The top price for Tunxi drawn-core Zhenmei was 210 yuan, which was not higher or lower than before. However, due to the large volume of Qimen tea on the market, most traders did not pay attention to it, and the trading was slightly sparse.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silkworm Cocoons Are of Excellent Quality</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang silkworm cocoon harvest is abundant: cocoon firms are opening scales one after another.</p>
<p>Jiashan cocoon firms opened scales today. Farmers in various cities and towns are raising silkworms smoothly this year. However, the seeds are different. Native silkworms have suffered damage from the weather, and there are not many silkworms left. Improved varieties are being raised using new methods. Recently, the weather has been mild, and the silkworms have developed rapidly. The early silkworms have been on the mats for many days and can be cocooned soon. The late silkworms are also undergoing their fourth molt with vigorous leaves. Cocoon firms are scheduled to open scales today. It is heard that due to the unified control, the highest price for improved silkworm cocoons is 35 yuan, and the price for native silkworm cocoons is 25 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening price of new silk cocoons in Xin Deng is not high. This year, there are more silkworms in various cities and towns, especially in Lutou and Xukou. More native varieties are being raised in Sanxi Town and Gangkou, so the quality of the silkworms varies. Native silkworms have suffered considerable losses, while improved silkworm cocoons have a relatively abundant yield, with a 70-80% harvest. Xiehe and other cocoon firms have opened scales, but the prices are not high. The average price for improved silkworm cocoons is only a little over 30 yuan, and the price for native silkworm cocoons is 10 yuan. The cost of silkworm leaves for each household is 35 or 36 yuan, excluding labor costs. Most farmers are unwilling to sell at a loss and are doing their own soil drying and soil reeling.</p>
<p>The early silkworms in Shuanglin are on the mats. Shuanglin in the Huzhou area is a famous silkworm area. This year, the improved silkworm breeding is being supervised by instructors. More people are breeding improved varieties. The weather is warm, and the silkworms are developing smoothly. The early silkworms have already been on the mats and are making cocoons. A bountiful harvest of late silkworms with vigorous leaves is expected. Cocoon firms will open scales to collect cocoons within days.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Great Unity of Asian Buddhists</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Since Japan adopted a seemingly leisurely but actually frantically active "water bird diplomacy" toward China, Arima has announced three steps he formulated for enticing and trapping, buying out traitors, and preparing for military force, in accordance with this intention. These discussions are naturally different from "Baoling" diplomacy. They truly speak and are able to act, and act actively. Although many people are busy competing for prizes and holding meetings, as if nothing is wrong, others are truly "frantically active" according to his three steps without any bragging.</p>
<p>Issues such as the state plan for opening railways, postal services, and establishing customs are said to be under active preparation on the one hand and extremely recognized on the other. The truth is unknown to ordinary people, so let's not mention it for now and talk about trivial matters that "have no political meaning." The Tokyo Exhibition's welcome to the "press" has long passed. The "International Tourist Group" in Beiping and the Asian Ethnic Unity promoted through Jewish nationality are making a lot of noise. Although some people have loudly condemned them as "enticement," there are still people who will "fall into the trap." Recently, they have been coming and going like a revolving lantern, with ever-changing patterns. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tokyo has shouted out "the great unity of Asian Buddhists."</p>
<p>According to reports, after Tsubouchi was appointed as the director of the Eastern Cultural Affairs Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he actively promoted "religious policies." Recently, with "Re-recognition of Asia" as a slogan, it will convene the Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Congress. Its purpose is the same as the previously organized Greater Asia League as an expression mechanism of the Asian Monroe Doctrine. At the same time, it announced two outlines: (1) To promote the unity of Asian Buddhist masses; (2) To expound Asian culture and help the world and the people. This outline is naturally bright and just, so in addition to representatives from pseudo-organizations such as Mongolia, India, Java, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Taiwan, there will also be representatives from our country, such as a certain Master.</p>
<p>Buddhism is known for advocating purity and non-action. Therefore, many who convert to Buddhism are unwilling to involve themselves in the field of fame and gain, but instead soar high and retreat far. However, the "Sakyamuni" of the 20th century may have evolved, so we see many generals wielding steel knives and famous public figures involved in the temple court, also holding Buddhist beads and chanting Amitabha. Under the sway of the wind, the tyrannical aggressors are also "conspiring" through the Cultural Affairs Department and initiating the Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Congress. In the Spirit Mountain assembly, we face our master, how can it not be wonderful and grand!</p>
<p>The imperialism of invading small and weak nations is multifaceted. Therefore, in addition to the suppression of warships and cannons and the suppression of economic power, China has also lost much sovereignty and land under the guise of the cross. With the shift in the times, our wooden-clog-wearing friends have actually brought out the Buddha Tathagata as their magic weapon. Therefore, we are aware that these Buddhist representatives will be in the Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Congress to interact with pseudo-organizations. Their intention is not only to "humiliate the country." Examining his outline of "unity of Asian Buddhist masses" and the purpose of serving as the expression mechanism of the Asian Monroe Doctrine, we can naturally see his Sima's heart. The Crusades opened up the Eastern market for European commercial capitalism, and freedom of preaching broke through the closed-door policy of various colonies. These are the best historical evidence.</p>
<p>As for the so-called expounding Asian culture and helping the world and the people, it is inseparably linked to the declaration of dominating the Far East. Here, we see that although the 417 declaration was declared by Hirota as "not formally existing" and withdrawn, relying on his seemingly leisurely but frantically active policy, he is attempting to further invade British and American Southeast Asia, India, and other places. This is the reason why the Asian Buddhist Unity is the Asian Buddhist Unity.</p>
<p>As for us, attending the Buddhist Youth Congress will be the same as visiting the Tokyo Exhibition. Those who want to go will go, and those who oppose will oppose. Wasn't there already a Buddhist speech about "seeking oneself and not seeking others" at the banquet at the Tokyo Electric Club? This time, the travel expenses are 400 yuan per day. I advise the "laymen" and "sons of Buddha" across the country to go there together. This is our "religious policy."</p>
<h3>New Many Heart Sutra</h3>
<p>— Ma Ying</p>
<p>For several nights in a row, the alley was making a "tok-tok" sound. Often, this sound passed under my window, waking me from my sleep. When I opened the door in the morning, the first thing I saw was that bald head. My heart twisted, and I couldn't help but scold, "No wonder things don't go as expected most of the time, it turns out I ran into you, bald donkey!"</p>
<p>This morning, I was woken up by that sound again. I jumped out of bed, found a dog-beating stick, and rushed outside. The intention seemed to be to visit a friend, or to take a walk.</p>
<p>Finally, I stopped at a friend's house. That friend was usually an interesting person, but not today. He sat silently on a low stool, looking like an old monk in meditation. I felt very strange and asked why he was so cold to me today. My friend smiled, shook his head and said, "Don't misunderstand, I'm not being cold to you. Because I've become a monk, so I can't talk to you much."</p>
<p>I thought, "How unlucky. I visited a friend and found a half-way-there baldhead. It's like baldheads are fated to be with me, I can't get away from them everywhere." So, I said unhappily, "Since you've become a monk, you should know a few scriptures and mantras. As for you, I know you usually eat a lot of meat and fish, and you can't even follow the five precepts, let alone any scriptures or mantras. Wild monk! Pretending to be a disciple of Buddha, aren't you ashamed?"</p>
<p>My friend shook his head again and said, "Don't scold me blindly, I'll recite a scripture for you. This was personally taught to me by the Bodhisattva Guan Yin, called the New Many Heart Sutra." He then recited loudly: "Mind quiet, heart silent. Without worry, without care. Without knowing, without understanding. Sleep soundly, until the rooster crows. Open your eyes, laugh out loud." After he finished reciting, he laughed out loud.</p>
<p>At this time, I could no longer make jokes. I felt that my friend was truly a person of high moral character and virtue. Because if all sentient beings in the world could follow his words and deeds, without worry, without care, without knowing, without understanding, falling asleep immediately and laughing when they opened their eyes, then the world could have favorable weather and eternal peace.</p>
<h3>Hostess</h3>
<p>— Gu Yue</p>
<p>North Sichuan Road is filled with the light of red lanterns. A straight and smooth road is matched with white serge pants, white and black leather shoes, and a fluttering long cheongsam sets off bare thighs. They walked in pairs, very orderly. When each pair approached Target Road, the most noteworthy thing was the hostess leaning against the door under the red lantern of the New York Ice Drinking Room. A beautiful girl, her face full of the smile of early summer.</p>
<p>Jia and I were a pair of idle night wanderers. Jia had recently lost love and ran to the ice drinking room every night. Jia was infatuated with the hostess, and I sympathized with the hostess, because once, when I walked into this ice drinking room, the girl welcomed us with a spring breeze. Jia couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"Girl, let's have a cup of ice cream together!"</p>
<p>She didn't speak, smiled, and added another cup, sitting next to Jia with a thump.</p>
<p>"Girl, where are you from?"</p>
<p>"Zhejiang."</p>
<p>"Have you studied?"</p>
<p>"How could I not have studied? I'm still in my second year of high school!"</p>
<p>"The way out for women," I sighed.</p>
<p>"Then, why don't you study and come to be a hostess?"</p>
<p>"No one in my family is producing. Neither my older brother nor my father is engaged in proper business. My mother relies on her ten fingers to make a living, but she is old. How can I afford to study? So I had to step into this trap." She said gloomily, and after a long silence, she finally couldn't bear it anymore, sighed, and continued with an excited conversation.</p>
<p>"I used to pity the hostesses, I used to say that the hostesses were depraved, and recently I even scolded Mayor Ping for encouraging female students to be hostesses. But unexpectedly, recently, just a week ago, I was also a hostess cursed by predecessors. How can I not be sad!" She said, almost shedding tears.</p>
<p>Jia was silent, as if repenting; I was silent, with a belly full of sympathy, unable to vent; she stared silently at the pink ice cream.</p>
<p>"Hey! Number Four! Shaved ice!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" The girl sighed and said, "I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>"Jia, should you still have ambition? We should pity her!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I repent, I will still advise her when she comes!"</p>
<p>"Hey, bring two more glasses of chicken day shaved ice." This is the only way to call her over.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Sure enough, after a while, she walked over smiling with two glasses of shaved ice in her hand.</p>
<p>"Can I sit for a while?" She didn't speak and sat down.</p>
<p>"Girl, I advise you not to be sad. There are very few hostesses like you. Take out your courage and struggle against the harsh environment! You are a high school student, you should understand what I mean!"</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>We sat in silence for a long time, put a bill into her hand, and paced out.</p>
<h3>Buying and Selling</h3>
<p>— Shuxian</p>
<p>Just the day before the female workers were paid, the Mō Wēn held a small piece of printed cloth in her hand, with a cunning smile on her face, and went to each of the female workers in turn, saying: "Look how good this cloth is! And the price is cheap, only selling for one yuan a zhang!: : : : :"</p>
<p>Past experience told them that everyone knew that the Mō Wēn was up to no good again! The smarter ones, before the Mō Wēn finished speaking, hurriedly grabbed and held on to her, saying: "What you said is really true, Qian Niang! This good fabric and this cheap price, if I hadn't bought cloth yesterday, I would definitely ask Qian Niang to help me buy some."</p>
<p>"But no matter what, you still have to buy one yuan's worth, child! You know this is something others entrusted to me to do, I can't refuse, and you should also support me. The future is long, and you will still have to work here in the future!" The Mō Wēn knew very well that it pained these poor female workers as much as being stabbed with a knife to take out a yuan. She could only adopt this hard, commanding method of forcing them.</p>
<p>The Mō Wēn spoke bluntly, and the female workers knew that there was no way to avoid this one yuan ripoff! They had no choice but to give her a slight nod with a bitter smile. Only then did she smile and move forward two steps, and went to the second female worker in turn.</p>
<p>After all, A-Jin's age was too young, and her brain was clumsy. When the Mō Wēn held the same small piece of printed cloth and went to her to say the same things, she did not reply in the same way as the other female workers. She instead showed displeasure, puffed up her small mouth, and shook her head, saying: "Qian Niang, the last time you sold me socks for one yuan for four pairs, my dad said when I took them home that the stuff was only worth a dime a pair and no one would buy them. I don't want this cloth, my dad will beat me if I get scammed again!"</p>
<p>"Is that true?" The cunning smile on the Mō Wēn's face disappeared in an instant, replaced by a frighteningly steely expression.</p>
<p>"No! It's that I don't have money! Qian Niang also knows that I only get five yuan in wages after paying the customs tax. : : : :" A-Jin looked a little scared at the Mō Wēn's face. She said with a bitter face and a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Then, don't come to work tomorrow!" The Mō Wēn said and turned to leave, but A-Jin hurriedly grabbed the corner of her clothes.</p>
<p>"Qian Niang! I'll buy it! : : : One yuan's worth! : : : :" A-Jin's tears reached her cheeks, her breathing and voice were so urgent.</p>
<p>"That's a good child! Qian Niang's days to follow your wishes are long!" The Mō Wēn smiled again! And walked to the front of another female worker.</p>
<p>The next day, our Mō Wēn held many small packages wrapped in shop signboard paper and handed them to each female worker in turn. Each female worker reluctantly took a banknote from her pocket and stuffed it into her palm.</p>

<h3>Stepmother</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am a woman nearing adulthood. Five years ago, during my elementary school days, I was very happy. Who knew that the weather is unpredictable, and misfortune can strike at any moment? The only person in the world who loved me (my mother) departed from me. At that time, my father was very wealthy, so he immediately took a stepmother. The stepmother's attitude towards me is, of course, self-evident. Unexpectedly, good fortune never comes in pairs; disaster strikes alone. My father's business suddenly failed, coupled with the Shanghai war, and now we are penniless. It is difficult to support all the expenses in the family. I feel that going on like this is very dangerous, so I discussed it with my father and temporarily took a job in a relative's store, leaving early and returning late, earning a little remuneration. The old woman constantly puts on airs, nagging endlessly, but because of my livelihood, I have to swallow my anger. After finishing work at night and returning home, I still have to help my stepmother take care of everything. If I am slightly unsatisfactory, I will be subjected to her cold words and contemptuous looks. Because I don't want to quarrel with her, I have to swallow my anger. In recent months, she has treated me even worse. Because she gave birth to a child two months ago. I get up at six o'clock in the morning to prepare everything for her, and then rush to the store, working busily until 9:30 in the evening when I return home. I also have to wash her clothes and the baby's diapers, and do other chores. I don't get to sleep until 12:30 at the earliest. As for her? From morning to night, she holds the baby in her arms and doesn't care about anything else, and still says she is very tired. As for me, I work from six in the morning until after twelve at night, like a slave, and yet I am treated coldly. Now I will give an example to show the wickedness of her intentions towards me.</p>
<p>One day last month, the weather in the morning was very warm, and I wore a lined shirt to the store. Unexpectedly, after three o'clock in the afternoon, a sudden wind and rain arose, and the weather turned cold, making it very unbearable. I thought my stepmother knew that I had come wearing a lined shirt, and perhaps she would have someone send me a cotton coat. But it was not sent even until the evening, so I had to endure until I finished work and returned home, urgently changing into a cotton coat. She said coldly, "You have a cheap constitution, not wearing a cotton coat in the morning, wanting to freeze yourself?"</p>
<p>Alas! Sir, think about it, the weather was so warm in the morning. How could I wear a cotton robe? I didn't argue with her, just wept secretly.</p>
<p>Now I feel that there is no hope left in relying on my family. Therefore, I am trying hard to seek independence, but I know that to be independent, one must first be financially independent. To be financially independent, one must have a decent profession. To seek a decent profession, one must have considerable knowledge and skills, but I ask myself if I have no skills at all. Although I have the ambition to be independent, I cannot realize it. Also, I don't know what kind of profession is most suitable for women? Where can I obtain knowledge and skills? If I want to leave this wicked family and this stubborn store, how should I start? Alas! It's extremely difficult.</p>
<p>I think the future is very dark, and there is no way to think. I can only ask a wise sir to give me guidance. I wish you peace.</p>
<p>Respectfully, C</p>
<p>Answer: The abuse of children from a previous marriage by stepmothers is a very common phenomenon in Chinese society. To escape this suffering, "seeking independence" is indeed the only way. According to your meaning, seeking a profession requires work skills. This is of course true, but in this era of a surge in the number of unemployed people, even having skills cannot guarantee that you will definitely get a job. Moreover, considering your family situation, it is unlikely that you will be allowed to go back to school. Therefore, waiting until you have skills before looking for a job may not be realistic. I think you don't have to be in a hurry to leave your family and the store where you work. If your stepmother makes you angry, you don't have to worry about trivial matters and don't get angry yourself. If it really becomes unbearable, then you can't just give in and let her do whatever she wants. You can complain to your father. If your father ignores you, you can tell others and ask them to uphold justice. Being subjected to the old woman's temper is unavoidable for employees. You can adopt the same attitude towards her as you do towards your stepmother. On the other hand, you should try your best to find opportunities to find a job that suits your abilities and offers better pay, such as a female office worker in a company. If you find a better job, your stepmother, being a snob, will inevitably see that you are helping with the finances and will not be as harsh on you as before. At this time, you should take the opportunity to study hard on your own or enter a cram school to learn some work skills. As for what kind of occupation is suitable for women, it is difficult to say in this era when women's occupations are underdeveloped. Elementary school teachers, accountants, typists, etc., are generally more suitable for women.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more point that you did not mention, but it should be noted. Nowadays, working women, in addition to being subjected to the boss's temper, are also subjected to insults such as being treated as a "flower vase." This situation is especially evident in large companies and stores. You don't have to be mentally pained by this kind of treatment, but you should consider it carefully and cautiously plan your response. Editor</p>

<h3>May Roses</h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>Seeing the pink roses, dreamlike memories gnaw at my heart. Oh, pink dreams!</p>
<p>Time is as distant as clouds! Or maybe I was only eighteen years old. I lost my home, alone and burdened with depression. When I was wandering in Hangzhou, the pink dream curtain was gently drawn open:</p>
<p>Every night, I could always find my footprints in the lakeside park. I would often lean against the railing, silently welcoming the moon, letting the moon's light adorn the still lake surface into a large mirror. Sometimes I would even silently see the moon off, letting the lake surface fade, light gray, dark gray, getting darker and darker.</p>
<p>One evening (it was spring), after wandering around the lakeside as usual, I silently leaned against the railing, wistfully gazing at the silver ripples, and sad thoughts burst forth in my heart. For a long time, a burst of lewd laughter was brought by the breeze! The pleasure boats at night.</p>
<p>Reason could no longer suppress the torrent of trauma. The twinkling of the ripples blurred before my eyes (my vision was obscured by the liquid in my eye sockets). Raising my trembling voice, soullessly:</p>
<p>(Where is your home?)</p>
<p>I have no home!</p>
<p>My home is a village devoured by beasts!</p>
<p>(Where is your lover?)</p>
<p>I have no love!</p>
<p>My lover is a girl kidnapped by beasts!</p>
<p>O sinful black hand!</p>
<p>You have taken away the brilliance of light!</p>
<p>After singing, I felt like a lost seagull! When a light breeze blew, I noticed two strangely cold lines on my cheeks.</p>
<p>Realizing my behavior, I turned around and saw a girl sitting on the long chair, wearing black clothes.</p>
<p>The moonlight covered the girl: her face was pale, and two silvery tears hung on her cheeks.</p>
<p>I looked at her with sympathy; she looked at me with sympathy! But in the end, I quietly left.</p>
<p>Every night, I always left under such circumstances.</p>
<p>After more than a dozen times, she didn't wait for me to leave and said tremblingly.</p>
<p>"Sir, your voice is too tragic..."</p>
<p>"Ugh, ugh..." I stammered.</p>
<p>"Sir, please don't doubt me, I am very sympathetic to you."</p>
<p>"Girl, I don't believe there are people in this world who sympathize with me; I don't want anyone to sympathize with me even more!"</p>
<p>She cried.</p>
<p>In this way, I formed a romance with her.</p>
<p>In several villas on the banks of West Lake, when the roses were blooming blood red, our romance was as beautiful as the roses.</p>
<p>After two months of scarlet life, she suddenly disappeared. She didn't leave me a note, and there was no sign of her leaving in her belongings. Where did she go? Where did she go? To this day, I am still in the dark.</p>
<p>Oh, pink dreams!</p>
<p>Now, when I see the pink roses, dreamlike memories gnaw at my heart.</p>

<h3>The New Dodge's Independent Spring Suspension</h3>
<p>Since the advent of the Dodge six-cylinder car, its independent spring system has also become widely acclaimed. According to its function, each front wheel can move up and down independently without affecting the spring system of the other wheel. It is composed of strong coil springs and is extremely simple in structure and without any difficulty. This spring is positioned between two V-shaped support rods, one on the upper side of the frame and one on the lower side of the frame, and is connected at both ends by supporting elbow levers. As for the legs of the upper V-support rod, they are attached to double-acting shock absorbers.</p>
<p>Independent front spring systems are not uncommon in various parts of Europe, but the one installed in the new Dodge has undergone rigorous testing over many years, and its effectiveness is unmatched. The front springs of ordinary cars are composed of a series of overlapping flat leaves. When a wheel encounters an obstacle, the flat leaves bend. However, since this is the only connection between the chassis and the front axle and wheel disc, the normal relationship between the front wheel and the wheel axle and the vehicle depends entirely on the front springs. Moreover, because the road surface is uneven, the wheels often lose their proper position. Therefore, for the sake of the entire vehicle, it is necessary to equip springs that are strong enough to resist this kind of movement. When using the brakes, the wheels want to stop, but the car's forward force wants to continue to move forward. Therefore, the strength of the springs must be sufficient to cope with this kind of thrust. All of these are the reasons why the front springs of ordinary cars must be relatively strong. According to the facts, the more flexible the springs, the better the ride quality of the car. This is a well-established principle and has long been known. It is only because of the above reasons that it has not been applied. Furthermore, if more flexible springs are used, their length must naturally increase accordingly. However, in ordinary cars, the length of the springs is inherently limited. If only the proper softness is considered, then on the other hand, they will be too long or even protrude from the front of the car. This is another reason why ordinary vehicles have not been able to use softer springs.</p>
<p>In view of this, Dodge engineers abandoned ordinary designs and completed a suspension method that allows Dodge products to use moderately flexible springs. The independent front spring suspension of the new Dodge six-cylinder car meets all needs. In addition to maintaining the normal relationship between the wheels and the chassis with two solid V-supports, one above and one below, and allowing each wheel disc to move up and down freely, the only function of the springs is to cushion the car to prevent all unevenness on the road surface. These coil springs, when extended, are about four times longer than the front springs of ordinary cars, and may even be longer than the wheelbase of the car. Furthermore, the use of these new springs and independent spring suspension not only makes the ride extremely comfortable, but also makes the management of the car extremely easy, because the wheels are not connected to the solid axle.</p>
<h3>American Gasoline Tax Evasion Is Significant, Reaching 2 Million Dollars Annually, Kyushu Authorities Seek to Prevent It</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>The development of the American automobile industry is the best in the world. The amount of gasoline it produces and sells each year is also considerable. The taxes levied by state and federal governments on gasoline amount to tens of millions of dollars annually, which is a major source of government revenue. However, unscrupulous merchants and smugglers often see profits to be made and smuggle gasoline out of the country. The amount of tax evasion amounts to millions of dollars annually. Since this matter is related to the national treasury, the government authorities have to strictly crack down on it. Recently, the governments of Kyushu sent representatives to hold a meeting to prevent tax evasion. The meeting place was in New York. The convener of this meeting was Mr. Gray, the Minister of Taxation and Finance of New York State. The participants in this meeting were the tax commissioners from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Delaware, Maryland, and Rhode Island.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of this meeting was to promote mutual assistance in taxation and to maintain law enforcement among the nine states in order to reduce and prevent the smuggling of gasoline and tax evasion. Therefore, the greatest hope is for the states to exchange information with each other. If there are any exports of gasoline across states, they should notify each other for verification. During the meeting, plans were made for the states to use the fastest and most complete methods to report the export or import of gasoline, so that both parties can confirm whether it is completely consistent with what was reported. In addition, it is planned to standardize the gasoline tax laws among the states and cooperate with the federal government.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Gray, the exchange of information among the states has been effective in recent years. However, it is slightly more difficult in ports and navigable waterways. The nine states present were closer to each other in terms of cooperation than other states. Currently, the various companies in the gasoline industry are working on taxation with the help of the American Petroleum Institute and the State Petroleum Committee. Each committee has dispatched investigators and auditors to conduct on-site investigations and report the materials obtained to the state authorities.</p>
<p>Each state also plans to formulate a uniform method for reporting information. In this way, the state authorities can accurately know the date and location of transportation. In addition, there are the quantity, details of the goods carried by the carrier, the number and letters of the vehicle, the name of the owner and driver of the tanker, the state license number, and the proof of service to the public. The air-flow Chrysler car, managed by Marty Motor Company, will arrive in Shanghai this week.</p>
<p>Currently, the authorities in New York and Pennsylvania have ordered the drivers of tanker transport vehicles to have receipts listing the above details and proof of oil tax payment. However, it is not easy to implement this matter. One reason is that there is too much vehicle traffic. The second reason is that the area is vast. For this reason, it is necessary to spend a lot of money to implement it.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, the Kyushu involved in the meeting collected US$129,381,702 in taxes on 4,196,989,720 gallons of gasoline in 1932. Although the exact amount of tax evasion is unknown, if it is calculated at 10 percent and the tax per gallon is 3 cents, it has exceeded US$1,259,096. In fact, the average state and federal tax rate is 4.5 cents, so the loss is no less than US$2,000,000 per year. Tax evasion increases due to differences in taxation between the two states. For example, if two states are adjacent, one state levies a tax of 2 cents and the other state levies a tax of 4 cents, then smugglers purchase gasoline in the state that levies a tax of 2 cents and transport it to the state that levies a tax of 4 cents for sale, thus netting a surplus of 2 cents in tax revenue. According to state laws, gasoline can be purchased in each state and "exported tax-free." Therefore, for example, if gasoline is purchased in New Jersey and transported to New York for use, it is not necessary to pay tax in New Jersey, assuming that the tax is paid in New York. There is also a group of smugglers who purchase gasoline in tax-exempt states and then smuggle it to other states for sale, without reporting it or paying taxes. Therefore, in New York State, there are often transport tanks and railroad tankers transporting gasoline. Eight of the Kyushu in the Kyushu meeting have the same difficulties, except for Vermont, which has no coastline and the situation is slightly different. There are also some tax evaders who purchase gasoline in Pennsylvania or New York and claim tax exemption in the name of export, but after the shipment, they transport it back to the original place for tax-free sale. Therefore, the authorities in New York and Pennsylvania are very active in patrolling ports and checking taxes.</p>
<p>Smugglers have come up with other tricks to deceive the authorities because of the strict port inspections. The method is to purchase gasoline and pay taxes according to law before transporting it into the state. For example, if a smuggler purchases 8,000 gallons of gasoline and pays a tax of 3 cents per gallon according to regulations, totaling 240 yuan, then mixes in 3,000 gallons of inferior kerosene. In an instant, the smuggler has 11,000 gallons of gasoline for sale on the market. Another method is to set up a factory and purchase gasoline in the name of industrial use, and then transfer it to smugglers.</p>
<p>The total number of cars in the Kyushu participating in the meeting convened by Mr. Gray accounts for about one-quarter of the total in the United States. The gasoline consumed accounts for one-third of the total in the United States. The gasoline tax and vehicle registration fees paid account for about one-quarter each. Therefore, if these nine states launch an attack on smugglers, the income of the national treasury can be enriched, and the benefits to other relevant states are significant.</p>
