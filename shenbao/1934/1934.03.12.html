<p>時評</p>
<h3>武裝準備與遠東和平　舒</h3>
<p>武裝和平。旣爲世界大戰以前之舊說。而軍需工業之刺激。又盡人皆知其係臨時性質。然當世諸國。無論爲金圓支配一切之美國。爲歐洲霸主之法蘭西。爲專心經營經濟之英吉利。爲盲目猛進之日本。爲社會主義之蘇聯。莫不薈萃精力於軍備之建設。準備有事於萬一。此中危機最深衝突最烈者。非歐洲之德法仇隙。亦非中歐之法意爭霸。蓋德意志雖痛恨凡爾賽和約之束縛。力求軍備之平等。但經濟力量薄弱。軍事設施。尙未充分。而意大利之結合匃奧。亦僅以外交爲作戰之根據。非眞决心以戰爭清算過去事實。用武力以滿足其希望也。至於巴爾幹爲暫歸平息之火山。雖有爆炸之材料。而尙在着手醞釀。肇禍猶須時日。</p>
<p>現世界中爆發戰爭之危險性較多。而事勢又較迫切者。厥爲日蘇間之種種爭執。中東路買賣旣不易成交。日本陖使傀儡刦路之企圖。亦難卽時中止。加以沿吉黑邊境有勃發意外之可能。日本且集中在滿兵力於興安嶺及綏芬河。蘇聯則自赤塔至海參崴。沿烏蘇鐵道。佈置精兵近二十萬。據一般觀察。此種緊張情勢。斷難長久維持常態。况日本青年將校駐在東北境内者。固亟欲乘時一試身手。現役及豫備役軍人。尤多倡必戰之論。又有北海漁業等綜錯關係。極易惹起意外重大之結果。是以日蘇戰爭之說。宣傳遐邇。遠東大戰之危機。尤易引人注意。矧美蘇復交以還。蘇聯突轉其守勢外交而爲攻勢。對日本之攻勢。特爲積極。自斯塔林以至遠東司令官加倫。又常針對日軍發爲警告。而日本飛機之飛越國境者。復爲蘇軍所轟擊。此種情形。寗非爲大戰前夕之朕光耶。</p>
<p>然而吾人尙不能不有所懷疑焉。吾人所懷疑者。非日蘇間戰與不戰之問題。而爲戰爭之時機問題。就普通觀察論。似乎戰爭之急迫。殆已朝不保夕。最近期間内。將不免於戰爭。由日蘇戰爭開端。卽不免引起第二次世界大戰。惟就雙方形勢。作客觀之推測。則日蘇戰爭。殊無短期内爆發之可能。此何以故。以蘇聯立塲言之。彼第一五年計劃方告完成。第二五年計劃正待開始。革命之根基。雖趨穩固。而實際之武力準備。尙待充實。是以對西歐各小國。皆力求外交上之圓滿。於資本主義諸國中如法如意。且訂立互不侵犯條約。貿易上之運用。更曲盡外交之巧妙。甚至對日。亦不惜與之提議互不侵犯條約。準此以觀。蘇聯决不至採取對日之武力攻擊。其故一也。至於日本。狂妄之流。誠高倡當在此時竭力一戰之論。而一般稍具近代知識之學者以迄於政治界人物。類都深悉日本處境之困難。其國内經濟現勢。决不許其眞正向外挑戰。祇須能保持日本現時海外市塲狀態。徐圖發展。已爲萬幸。矧其國内矛盾之尖銳。農村與城市經濟發展不平衡之結果。匪僅思想惡化。且足以根本動搖其政治機體。一旦發生戰爭。雖能保其必無絕大危險。卽彼軍閥中之上級領袖。近亦審知故意挑戰之非計。乃贊成對外稍示讓步。最近日本對蘇之緩和態度。可爲明證。其故二也。再次則日美間之對立。依然積極。太平洋風雲。且以美國添造軍艦而漸見緊張。不過美國此舉。仍以嚴密保守之意爲多。攻擊之意味殊少。故就表面觀察。似將因此促成日美之武力衝突。實際則適足以牽制日蘇武力爭鬥之開展。延緩未來戰爭之激化。則是當前堆積之種種惡材料雖多。非有更重大之挑撥。尙不至立刻爆發戰禍。此吾人對於時期問題之觀測也。</p>

<h3>德内政部長解釋民族問題</h3>
<p>排斥猶太人出於自衛</p>
<p>對其他民族並無歧視</p>
<p>數星期以來、因外國通信機關傳播不確消息之故、致遠東各國對德政府之種族計劃、頗有不安之處、而其中以日本及印�</p>
<p>度之輿論界爲尤甚、意以德國存意降低其他民族之地位、及意國在其本族人民之前使之落伍、引以自危、現敢以政府名義、聲明此項消息非但毫無根據、抑且絕無意識、查德國家社會黨在種族立法事件上之立塲、係因保存純粹種族、於德國民族前途關係至巨、卽其他民族、如亞洲各民族、亦均有此項同樣表示、</p>
<p>在德之外國種族最多者爲猶太族、按德國人口計之、猶太人僅佔一成半、自晚近數十年來、其間尤以自一九一八年後、因近東之猶太人風湧移入之故、致在德國之經濟·金融·文化·政治·各方面、猶太人之勢力乃倍形擴張、茲特略舉事實數項以資證明、在普魯士共有律師一萬一千八百十四人、其中猶太人計三千五百十五人、竟達全數百分之二十九·八、再就公證官言之、六千二百二十六名中有猶太人一千九百四十五名、佔全數百分之三十一·二、至若德國各大學之教職員中猶太人平均約佔全數百分之三十、在柏林及撥斯勞大學之醫學院中猶太教授且佔全數百分之四十五焉、</p>
<p>此項過量外族化之須事防止、遂成爲德國民族之生死關頭、是以德國種族立法之舉、蓋純係出於緊急自衛、非有所謂憎恨存在其間也、</p>
<p>此外、德國政府尙抱有一種目的、卽欲培植德國民族之本、使保存純粹種族之運動趨於穩固是也、德國政府在此項志趣之下、對諸其他種族、絕不願施以孰優孰劣之評斷、德政府亦且深知其他民族有較德國據有深遠高高之文化者、若謂有蔑視之意、殊非德國政府及其人民之意志、茲尤願述明者、所有旅德外僑均可各安其業、一如往昔德國教育機關對各國青年學子之歡迎、亦無不一仍其舊、</p>
<p>且各方對種族之全部問題、如混血婚姻等等、條陳中央、呈請政府予以立法上之解决、此舉本是無足驚奇、證以種族問題與德國民族關係之巨大、以及民衆對此關心之熱烈、卽可不言而喻、外國如竟因此對於德國種族立法問題發生重大謠言、設非出於誤會、當係故意揑造事實、其間或係誤解現行法令或將建議中之事件、目之爲已成及將成之事實、去之原意則遠矣、（國民社德國通信）</p>

<h3>讀書問答</h3>
<p>讀書方法論的討論（一）</p>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>鄙人年二十五，現肄業於某大學夜校法律系，日間以舌爲耕，月進頗足維持生活。自幼對於社會問題，頗感興趣，常思有以解决之。惜在初中時代，所讀之書，均非應讀，當時尙無社會科學基本智識，卽讀政治，經濟等巨著，一知半解，且均係瑣散之材料，缺乏一貫之觀念，對於定義槪念，不能把握其最近似之一個，以致今日讀書，有不求甚解之病，以爲書中云云，大槪爲曾所知，走馬看花，結果毫無頭緒，每逢討論一問題，必人云亦云，只能發生聯念作用，不能獨立思考。閒常考之，鄙人讀書不爲不多，且以讀書爲人生惟一樂事，不論何種學課，均曾一度努力，尤其對於文學，</p>
<p>積書近萬冊，而十數年來，所得印象，猶如霧中山色，祇能彷彿其崖略，倘欲作一專論·非搆思整日不行，然披讀別人所作，均爲意中所有，不知何故，謹懇指教。</p>
<p>再鄙人讀外國文，亦已六七年，英法日文，前皆致力，唯閱書每感困難，每一Ｐａｇｅ，字典必數十翻，近思對於英日文，再加工夫，（法文祇讀過二年）大學夜校有日文選課，擬另進中華職業學校補習英文，不知將來有成就否，上述二問，統希前輩授吾明燭，俾茫茫學海中，知所遵循也。　（汪兆鹍來信）</p>

<h3>孫中山先生的嗜好</h3>
<p>— 西嶽</p>
<p>中山先生的一生事業，祇是革命；他的一生嗜好，祇是讀書。他自己曾經說過：「我一天不讀書，一天便不能够生活。」他每天除了做事飲食以外，手裹總是拿着書的。他奔走革命，往來海外，行筐中總帶有幾本書籍，時常仔細研究。就是火綫上，指揮作戰也是帶了書本在乎邊，軍事的工作一停止，便拿起書來，從容的讀着。當陳炯明叛變時，先生避居在沙面兵船上，形勢非常險惡，可是他一點也不驚慌。只是坐在船艙裹讀拿坡倫傳·生死倒可以不顧，書却是不可不讀。</p>
<p>有一次先生革命失敗，寓居在倫敦，生活十分困難。有一位朋友在留學生裹面，湊集了三四十鎊，送給他維持生活。不料三天以後，那位朋友到他寓裹去看他，只見他已把那些錢買了一大堆重要的書籍，還津津有味的指給那位朋友看，這是什麼書，那是什么書。那位朋友不滿意的說：「爲什麼不把錢留着買麵包，反去買那些不急需的書籍呢？」先生却說：「書籍是精神上的麵包，精神上的麵包更是緊要呢！」</p>
<p>先生每年要許多錢買書，他覺得書籍比什麼都要重要。他一生沒有別的產業，逝世後交給他夫人宋慶齡女士的就只有許多書籍。</p>
<p>先生這樣的用功讀書，目的却不是爲了自己，還是要因爲改革中國，所以他讀的書，大多是和革命有關係的。總之，他把讀書和革命，并合爲一，一方面革命不忘讀書，一方面讀書不忘革命！</p>
<h3>汪精衛嗜雞雛成癖</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>黨國要人汪精衛氏，別署雙照樓主，伉儷情深，於斯可見，而氏若有駐顏術然者，數十年不加蒼悴，望之猶如少年中人，尤爲難得，氏對於飲食，極講衛生，以雞雛之最富滋養料，每餐必啖之，一餐能盡三隻，宴客例外，故有人爲之推算，殺雞雛年在三四千隻以上，與故譚茶陵之嗜魚翅，于右任之好辣椒，同爲佳話。氏之啖雞，製法凡數十種，或炙，或熏，或鹽漬，或糟醉，而紅燒白燉，調味相宜，蓋不如此恐易於壓棄也，一日聞人述及神仙雞泥塗雞煮法，乃試之以宴客，其法雞宰割後，和以舊油及酒，置諸於甑，甑又置諸於釜，釜中稍加鹽類，又清水若干，然後燃以薪柴，沸騰卽止，越五分鐘再燃，凡三次，雞已熟矣，是曰神仙雞，又宰雞不去毛羽，以葱薑醬油酒類，實於雞腹，隙裂處以綫縫之，</p>
<p>旣妥貼，乃以水泥遍塗其體，架义熏之，水泥乾至龜坼，力擲諸地，泥墮而毛羽隨之俱脫，臠啖之，芳脆味美，無與倫比。是曰泥塗雞，亦名呌化雞，蓋乞兒輩無所設備，以簡法治餚也，客進食，咸讚美不絕口，氏亦為之大喜，曰：無怪俗有呌化三年，官不要做之諺也，氏以常食雞故，特於宅中別闢一精室，專蓄雞雛，有白雞，錦雞，泰和雞，翻毛雞等，顏之曰知廉，取埤雅：「雞跑而食之，每有所擇，故曰知廉如雞」之意，並藉之以爲官箴也，氏生平頗畏新聞記者之見訪，以有許多不便發表之問題，而新聞記者必再三探詢，殊使人爲難也又不喜社會人士之歡迎，曩以病赴海外養息，久不返國，邦人君子念之，請之歸，旣歸止於滬壖，邦人君子擬爲開一盛大之歡迎會，西門及縣公署，均綴以五綵牌樓，配裝電炬，光芒萬丈，不料及期而氏忽乘輪作武漢之游，其怪僻殊可笑云。</p>
<h3>漕河涇之游</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>漕河涇，位於徐家滙西南，距滬市不十里，交通便捷，南市公共汽車可直達，或乘法商電車，止於徐家滙鎭，更乘人力車，約計十分鐘可至也。上星期日，應洗冠生君之召，偕張夢周陳仲英諸友，乘冠生園所備車，由斜土路出發，經滬杭公路，道途平坦，春風送暖，一轉瞬間，已抵其地，下車後，稍息於冠生園農塲，塲爲洗君前年購地。所經營者，廣袤可三十畝，遍植果木千枝，凡能摘實作糖果者都羅列焉。塲前僻地畝許，栽四季花卉殆遍，有地箱，有花房，花侍四五輩，各竭其能，雖嚴冬初經，入其間，五色繽紛，芳香四溢，足徵其努力不怠也，中央建四面廳，外形古樸，中採西式，洗君之意，今夏擬邀客作納凉游宴之所，廳后，草地平鋪，預設露天茶座，空氣清爽，極目四野，可消俗慮。其右藝金魚可二百缸，搜羅名種，計及三址，洗君謬採葑菲，委不佞顧問魚事，俟本年小魚繁殖，用以分贈顧客，法至善意至美也。其左長堤如虹，一望無際，掘地作池，堆土成山，方事延聘名家着手布置，他日者我知一輩沈醉洋塲塵霧中者，必爭至其地，一換新鮮空氣，旣無跋涉之勞，又能暢聆野趣，較諸滿鍍黃金長年永錮之私家園林，與夫夷屋冲霄矯揉造作之公共塲所，豈可與同日語哉？我儕就廳事稍進香茗，卽徒步出農塲西行里許，田畦一碧，茆舍相接，農邨固別有風味在也。一路橋樑新搆，途徑敞闊，知爲海上聞人黃錦鏞先生捐廉獨貲所興建者，耳黃家花園之名久，今日得一瞻仰，深自慶幸。是日，方有上海市社會局農產品流動展覽會假座展覽，四鄉婦穉，爭先趨觀，以是園中游客，陡增十倍，四教廳居園之中。取孔子文行忠信之義，奐輪奐美，陳設富麗，朝野名流，題字已遍，花木亭台，有條井井，小橋流水，頗具匠心，我人作片時之觀覽，不知經營者已費却幾許精神矣。園門之右，新設漕涇戲園，開市未久，觀者綦盛，是地之興，計日可待矣。歸途，經曹家墓園，停車入覽，有山有水，別有洞天，使一較黃園，則又有大巫小巫之判矣。勝游永日，餘興示闌，因濡筆記之。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十五回</p>
<p>淚臉送人辭家歸遠戍</p>
<p>風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城</p>
<p>自强道：弟兄們住的那屋子怎麼樣！你去瞧瞧。王士立道：不用瞧了。兩個屋子，都是連着的，這邊屋子，若是要坍下來的話，那邊屋子，决計保存不了。趙自強沉吟了一會子，笑着搖了兩搖頭道：沒事，再說罷。土立看那樣子，知道他是故作鎭靜，但是心裹也就想着，在這樣的風沙天裹，沒有屋子的話，反正不能露宿一宵的，且看團長對這件事，怎樣安排。到了沒辦法的時候，大槪也只有半夜裹去住民房呢？士立這樣猜着，事情恰恰是大爲相反。到了晚半天七點多鐘的時候，營長忽然發下命令來，準備出發。限一小時以内，準備定妥。四個連長得了這個命令，都有些愕然，這幾天並沒有什麼動靜，似乎無出發之必要。而且天氣是這樣的惡劣，無什麼要緊的話，又何必走。連長心裹都是如此，上士和營長不生直接關係的人，更是不知所云了。一小時以後，趙自强被營長傳去授命令了。他走回來時，臉上帶了一種不甚自然的淡笑，那樣子好像是說，營長的命令，有些開玩笑。士立當然是不敢去問連長的了，也就只有準備在這風沙漫天的夜裹吃苦去。不一會兒工夫，外面已經吹着招集號，全營的人，在院子裹排隊以後，就在寶芳營長督率之下，向前進行了。出了喜峯口，順着塞外大道，向東北前進，並無其他隊伍，僅僅是這一營人。士立傍着自强走，低聲道：咱們可走了，那房子坍下來，可壓咱們不着了。自强道：哼！不是房子坍，咱們還不………（三三三）</p>

<h3>主婦須知　家用品經濟法</h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>用煤　到了冷天，家裹生火爐是少不得的。不過火燼生得不得其法，很費煤的。在經濟方面看來，大不合算。若是對於燒煤富有經騐，那麼所費不多，所得的效果却很大的。最簡便的用煤經濟方法如下：</p>
<p>在早晨火爐中的火頭引得大些，不妨燒得發焰光，所謂「爐火熊熊」，就是要燒到的目標。加下去的煤，要一塊一塊的緊緊地堆着，傾注少許水在頂上。假使可能的話，不到中午，且不要把煤抖鬆，把火撥動，使火頭加大，要知道一根抖煤撥火的火棒，是用煤經濟法的仇敵，所以最好不要去用它，除非眞正十分需要，那麼免不得去用它。</p>
<p>有時候一間有病人的房間中，需要通夜不熄的火爐；那麼在爐格（或稱火床）的床上，堆兩三層小塊的煤，在後面用煤屑來裝滿，差不多通常的裝煤次序顚倒一下。現在在煤的頂上，大量的鋪放些紙頭與木片；在木片之上，把雞蛋大小相仿的煤塊一層一層的放上去，到末後放上些灰燼。</p>
<p>點着一根火柴，引到紙頭上去，讓它儘量的燃燒，但是嗣後不要把火撥動，把煤抖鬆。起先不免有少許的烟，但是隔了一回，火就會平穩地燃燒，並且可以繼續這樣的燒數小時。這種爐火，假使當心地引着了，常是一種成功。</p>
<p>地毯　精美考究的地毯，價值非常昂貴，質地粗劣的地毯，却是不甚經用。現在有一種紙製的地毯，所費不多，且可禦寒，在經濟與衛生兩方面，都有相當的利益，依法製用，定能滿意。茲述製法於下：</p>
<p>先把居室的地板檢查與測量一下。如有鋲或平頭小釘等，都要除去，假使一時不能除去，不妨用鎚把它們深深地擊入地板裹去。如地板有碎裂補片等粗糙不平之處，設法使平，這樣纔可得一完全清潔的外觀，十分平滑的表面了。這些事做好之後，就可把幾張棕色厚紙，糊裱在地板上，兩張紙邊相接的地方，要拼湊得緊貼，沿邊要糊裱得平服。然後在棕色厚紙上面，再糊裱一層任何一種花樣美麗的光面紙（西名Ｃａｒｔｒｉｄｇｅ　Ｐａｐｅｒ），其中以仿嵌木細工的花樣，爲最悅人心目的一種。若以無用的舊上衣，翦成光面紙一樣大小，溙以油溙，鋪在上面，可以代作地毯。這種價廉物美，製法新穎的地毯，可以洗滌，可以負重，可以保護所糊裱的紙，而地板毌須擦亮，也不必拖洗。</p>
<p>地板上糊裱這種紙製地毯的最大利益有二：一是不通風，有防禦寒氣的功用；因爲我們居室中一部分的冷氣，是從地板下面上來的。二是無黴菌或微生物藏匿之所，因爲普通的地板上鋪了地毯，微生物或黴菌，都由地毯中沈入，躲在地毯下地板的隙縫中，做窠繁殖。現在用厚紙糊裱了，它們便沒有藏身之處。所以我們居室中的地板，若是多隙縫的，倒是用這種經濟的紙製地毯，來得有益衛生。</p>

<h3>參加遠東運動會菲日預選俱將完竣</h3>
<p>菲律賓田徑游泳上月已經選拔</p>
<p>日本去秋卽着手將於本月結束</p>
<p>第十屆遠東運動會、已定本年五月十二日起、在馬尼拉舉行、日近一日、距今不過二個月而已、菲日兩國、各方俱秣馬厲兵、積極準備、獨我國尙無準備、前日才由全國體協董事常會决定預選辦法、須俟下月中旬才行田徑及籃球預選、則距開會、不過只有半個月之練習耳、據東京及馬尼拉之消息、日本於去秋卽開始選拔、如籃球已合宿練習數次、游泳田徑無不早已决定、且有本月月終結束一切之議、僅棒球尚待預選耳、菲島方面、亦於上月三日選拔賽完竣、游泳等選手、俱已决定、回顧我國、不勝有太形落後之感、茲將兩處通訊、彙刊於後、以供當局之參考耳、</p>
<h3>菲島田徑實力</h3>
<p>（馬尼拉通訊）爲「滿洲國」參加問題而令人屬目之遠東運動會、會期已日愈迫近、離今只有二月矣、大會現正在積極籌備中、各國亦正在積極籌備參加、日本於田徑錦標、獲勝當無異義、故日本選手、對于遠東運動會、似亦不如菲島選手之關心、本屆大會、菲島因佔有地利關係、故熱望在大會中獲得意外收穫、菲律賓體育協會、自於二月三四兩日、在約涉利沙爾運動塲（卽遠東運動會會塲）舉行全國預選會後、菲島之田徑選手、業經正式選定、早已開始練習、就最近一月來來菲島選手之成績、其實力尙隔日人遠甚、惟大會會期、距今尙有兩閱月、故在此兩月中、尙有產生優秀紀錄之可能、就最近菲選手之紀錄、卽可想見菲島在開會時菲田徑選手之成績矣、</p>
<h3>（一）短跑</h3>
<p>百米芬達比拉十秒六</p>
<p>二百米柯里斯二二秒</p>
<p>先就短跑而論、遠東素所聞名之伸乍加、與尼泊墨西諾二人、已放棄運動生活、其雄姿將再不見於遠東會塲中矣、菲島最近之短跑界、多係幼稚之輩、且從所未聞名者、計有沙魯涉特（桑托瑪大學學生）百米成績十一秒、二百米成績二十二秒六、柯里斯特哈魯（菲律濱大學學生）二百米成績二十二秒正、李別拉（桑托瑪大學學生）百米成績十一秒一、締烈歐（桑托瑪大學學生）百米十秒八、芬達比拉（菲律濱大學學生）二百米二十二秒六、此外尙有中學生締列古洛與浦那芝克二人、締之百米成績十一秒四、二百米成績二十三秒、浦之百米成績十一秒、二百米成績二十三秒、</p>
<p>各短跑選手中、就中最有希望者、爲沙魯涉特、比較最有把握、跑時常在十一秒二以内、芬達比拉則於最近之練習中、得十秒六、李別拉於一月下旬在三大學對抗賽（菲大、桑大、及民大、）得學時代卽稱著、自入菲大後、愈能揮發其駿足、其百米成績、亦在十一秒以内、</p>
<p>以上諸選手、雖屬新進、然菲人於遠東之短跑中、有統傳性之實力、卽日人吉岡·佐佐木·與西貞一、亦不得不困苦應付、至於菲島是否起用老手伸乍加與尼泊墨西諾、現尙未决定、至於吾國之劉長春、在百米中、非有十秒五六之成績、則恐不能得分、二百米中、較百米之希望尤少、因日人吉岡·佐佐木之二百米成績、均爲二十一秒二、西貞一之成績爲二十一秒三、</p>
<h3>（二）四百米</h3>
<p>洛克－五一秒八</p>
<p>四百米中、菲島之陣容、全係老將、計有阿蘭浦拉（菲大）埃司特拉達（菲大）、洛克（陸軍）淮特（陸軍）、淮特與阿蘭浦拉二人、均係中欄能手、埃卂特拉達則無昔日之勇氣、在全菲預選會中竟遭失敗、洛克僅以五十一秒八之紀錄而得冠軍、在三大學對抗賽中、加蘭瓦（非大）之成績爲五十一秒九、此外在五十二秒實力者、有中學生瑪加哈魯成績五十二秒四、（全菲預選第二）及瑪拉哈（菲大）成績五十二秒六（全菲預選第三）又沙雷大學之芝魯埃達選手、有五十二秒三之實力、但在全菲預選是落居第四、因其個人失察、先參加二百米預賽、（得二十二秒六之成績）致在四百米决賽中失敗、淮特老矣、其在前年之成績、四百米爲五十秒正、四百米中欄爲五十四秒八、現在已達不到其最高峰矣、</p>
<h3>（三）中距離</h3>
<p>八百米亞達耳一分五九秒四</p>
<p>千五百米亞達耳四分十秒八</p>
<p>中距離中之菲選手亞達耳、爲菲島最有希望之老將、頗於日人重大之威脅、在上次遠東運動會中、其八百米成績、曾平等日本全國紀錄、最近其成績仍不减當年、八百米成績二分一秒六、千五百米成績四分十一秒三、均創菲島新紀錄、更於全菲預選會之十日後、八百米遠成一分五九秒四、千五百米造成四分十秒八之傑作、遠東徑賽中、亞氏極有大得分之把握、此外拉姆巴、安鐵斯·奴特·修克等、均有二分二秒左右之成績、奴特·安鐵斯·具斯庭之於千五百米、均有四分十五秒左右之成績、全菲預選之萬米第一埃斯諾比沙（菲大）、成績三十五分三十二秒二、惡劣不堪、</p>
<h3>（四）跳欄</h3>
<p>高欄加西亞十五秒</p>
<p>中欄阿蘭浦拉五四秒八</p>
<p>徑賽中最能予日人以威脅者、厥爲跳欄、因此項菲軍之陣容特別完璧、去年得十五秒成績之加西亞（陸軍）、今年成績曾退步至十五秒八、但在全菲預選中、則以十五秒二通過預賽、而再以十五秒得村冠軍、預料在遠東大會中、有壓倒日人清水、村上、福井三選手之可能、又中學生哈涉爾、去年曾有十四秒九之成績、今年則爲加所敗、在全菲預選中、以十五秒四得第二、中欄菲人更濟濟多士、阿蘭浦拉之成績五十四秒八、淮特之成績五十五秒六、加西亞之成績五十六秒八、洛阿（民國大學）之成績五十八秒二、</p>
<p>在全菲預選中、淮特則壓倒阿蘭浦拉、其二人之實力、均有戰勝日本陸口與福井之可能、</p>
<h3>（五）跳高</h3>
<p>伯蘭克一米八五</p>
<p>托立比哇退隱可惜</p>
<p>田賽中菲島之最大損失、爲托里別亞之隱退、托氏曾以二米正之成績保持遠東紀錄、上次世界運動會、亦曾列居第三、托氏於出席世運後、卽入美籍、並在南加洲大學肄業、去年因故復返菲島、隱居於遠離馬尼拉市之達枯羅巴村中、從此已不復出席運動會矣、全菲預選中、伯蘭克氏以一米八五得冠軍、伯原爲留美學生、現任哈斯排魯小學校長、</p>
<p>托里比亞旣不出席遠東、不但菲島在跳高中不能得分、且爲大會減色不少、此外菲大之哈斯吉阿魯、成績爲一米八十、恐無濟於事矣、</p>
<h3>（六）跳遠</h3>
<p>跳過七米者甚少</p>
<p>拉巴洛六米七四</p>
<p>跳遠一項、菲島更形寂寞、跳過七米者很少、卽間有之、亦不過僥倖之一二次而已、全菲預選中、拉巴洛（西利曼大學）成績六米七四、他如哈斯吉亞魯、（菲大）加里諾、（陸軍）均有六米五十以上之實力、又菲島跳遠名手瑪魯知年芝、曾有六米八九之成績、但在全菲預選時、因傷足未克出塲、</p>
<h3>（七）撑竿跳</h3>
<p>斯智哥三米六七</p>
<p>撑竿跳方面、唯一陸軍斯智哥一人其成績爲三米六七、旣不及我國、更難與日本四米級之選手對抗矣、其次尙有斯瓦魯特（桑大）成績爲三米四五、</p>
<h3>（八）三級跳</h3>
<p>那蘭巴洛十四米六五</p>
<p>三級跳方面、埃巴介李斯大（菲大）於年前曾有十四米五六之成績、本屆大會希望甚濃、但全菲預選時、彼未曾出塲、全匪預選之第一爲巴斯邱洛、以十四米三七得第一、第二名則爲一中學生那蘭巴洛、那之成績、最近進至十四米六五、殊可驚人、將來大會或可入選、</p>
<h3>（九）三鐵</h3>
<p>鐵餅阿瑪智三八米二五</p>
<p>鐵球肥科十二米二一</p>
<p>標槍巴斯古魯五三米○一</p>
<p>投擲方面、菲島實力尤薄、鐵球鐵餅標槍三項之中、僅阿瑪智（阿智介學校）之鐵餅銷有希望、成績爲三八米二五、但非擲過四十米、則不能在遠東得分、鐵球肥料（菲大）之成績爲十二米二一、標槍吧斯古魯（陸軍）之成績爲五十三米○一、均幼稚非常、</p>
<h3>日本預選槪况</h3>
<p>（一）田徑賽</p>

<h3>舶來之江湖醫藥</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>醫有江湖之醫…藥亦有江湖之藥</p>
<p>外籍醫生外國藥品政府應加檢定</p>
<p>若任其來華開業實吾醫界之障礙</p>
<p>拜外心理不可有嚴格檢舉不可無</p>
<p>今之人恒言，曰「來路貨」，來路貨者，不僅舶來物品而已！舶來之人物亦然。國人之心理，對於外籍之人物崇拜不暇，對於舶來之貨品服用不已，此「來路貨」三字所以爲今人之口頭禪也。此種現象，隨時隨地，表現無餘，而於醫藥界爲尤顯，其阻碍吾國新醫藥界之進展至大且烈。須知外籍人物，崀莠不齊，外來貨品，優劣相間，吾人於其良者優者自當尊崇之仿效之，而於其莠者劣者，亦一味不加辦別，崇拜而服用之，非所謂盲目之拜外主義耶？夫醫有江湖之醫，藥亦有江湖之藥，來華之外籍醫生與來華之外國藥品，不必皆江湖也，而江湖者實居其半，嘗考來華之外醫，有因在本國無地位者，故不得不以中國爲其唯一之出路，而來華之外藥，尤大半純爲謀利起見，以中國爲其唯一之銷塲，然則其來華之目的，可謂完全出於經濟侵略之野心矣。蓋一方因國人拜外之心理，而其地位自高，一方又因吾國新醫界之介紹病人與新藥商之推銷藥品，而其營業日盛。雖然，彼輩之慾望，固尙未能滿足也，方且大施其含沙射影之手腕，與利用我國之買辦階級，以離間及消滅社會對於吾新醫界之感情與新藥界之信仰，其仇視吾新醫藥界之心理，昭然若揭，其爲障礙，豈不百倍於舊醫藥耶？</p>
<p>年來吾人言論，多偏重於舊醫藥之批評與新醫藥界内部之整頓，故新醫中之不肖者，亦嘗揭示其江湖之行爲，以轉移社會之視聽矣，獨對於外籍之江湖醫生，外籍之江湖藥品，則尙未能儘量的暴露其奸險，以與國人共見共曉。要知本國之江湖醫生，其江湖之技倆有限，有識之士，望而知其奸詐，所謂只可欺人於一時，而終難逃於社會之明鑒也。至於外籍之江湖醫藥則不然，有其强有力之政府爲其後盾，有其雄厚之資本供其舖張，而更有爲虎作悵者效其奔走，職是之故，國人對於本國之新醫，國產之新藥，多所懷疑，而惟外來者之是崇焉，無形之中墮其　中不能自拔。至其出身之是否正當，學術之是否高明，藥品之是否精良，舉皆無暇問及。其江湖之手腕，不亦高妙萬分也耶？</p>
<p>若就職業利益上之立塲觀之，外籍醫生，外國藥品，非經吾國政府正式檢定者，卽根本無在華開業與推銷之權利，此徵之各國之處理外國醫藥情形而可信者也。須知學術爲天下公器，雖非一國所能私，而職業爲民命所關，實有保護之必要，故外籍醫生之來華者，若能遴選其錚錚佼佼之流，而畀以教授之位置，則對於國内學術之飢荒，未嘗不可以小補，若聽其開業，限制毫無，其爲吾國醫界之障礙，匪可言喻，吾黨之士，雖無操縱政令之權，而有供獻意見之責。若能本此目的，對於外籍之江湖醫生，外來之江湖藥品，加以眞憑實據之批評，一方喚醒人民之拜外心理，一方銷滅吾國新醫藥界之障礙，或亦吾人對社會對職業所應盡之義務也歟？吾黨之士，曷興乎來！</p>
<h3>人工氣胸法對於肺病之效力</h3>
<p>— 劉棨敬</p>
<p>（一）序論　文明各國對於癆病之治療及預防。經之營之。莫不苦心焦慮。引爲國計民生中之一難問題。故歐美及日本之肺病死亡率年年得以减少。回顧我國。爲政者固不樹百年之策。而民間對肺病之常識又在極幼稚時代。致病勢蔓延日廣。死亡年有增加。其間稍有智識者。知肺病之可畏。信新醫之規勸。守衛生。氣候。食物。藥品等療法。或可冀肺病之痊愈。然須長時間之靜養。費相當之經濟。致個人及社會上之捐失殊大。故在我國環境中。爲新醫者爲社會民生計對肺病之治療及預防必須籌安全之法。其法惟何。卽人工氣胸法是也。</p>
<p>開放性肺病。（卽痰中有肺結核菌可證明者）依從前療法變爲閉塞性者僅百分之十一。若依人工氣胸療法。可達百分之三十六。此人工氣胸法對預防方面之效也。從前對肺病之治療。以衛生。氣候。食物。藥品等爲臨床家之金科玉律。而長時期之休息又爲必須條件。其經濟的損失。勞動能力之减低。則又爲何如。若依人工氣胸療法。則比較的可迅速恢復。從前之肺癆病治愈率爲百分之十二。由人工氣胸法可增至百分之四十。此人工氣胸法對治療方面之效也。人工氣胸法之效騐如此。故特向讀者介紹之。</p>
<p>（二）人工氣胸法槪要　吾人胸壁内面及肺臟外面。都爲肋膜所包着。故肋膜如囊狀。中有間隙。卽爲肋膜腔。腔内之厭力爲陰壓。我人送一定量之空氣於此腔内。使成較低之陰壓或極微之陽壓。肺臟因而委縮至一定限度。對肺病可收相當之效果。是卽人工氣胸法也。行人工氣胸法。須備特種機械。由二主要部分成立。（一）測肋腔内之壓力裝置。（二）送入氣體裝置。人工氣胸之手術甚簡單。可由局部麻醉行之。故痛苦與危險極少。</p>
<p>（三）人工氣胸之臨床作用及其效果　肋腔内之壓力爲陰壓。故肺臟在胸腔内棠保持緊張狀態。因此使肺内空洞。膿瘍腔。肺組織壞崩等部。不能縮小及安靜。致治愈上受不良影響。若行人工氣胸。送入一定量空氣於肋腔内。使成爲較低之陰壓或低微之陽壓。則肺臟縮小。緊張度减輕。肺之呼吸運動减少或消減。於是肺得以安靜。爲肺病之治愈轉機上最要之條件。臨床時肺病患者在可能範圍内。行人工氣胸後。其顯著之效騐如下。</p>
<p>（一）熱下降。臨床時常覺辣手之微熱。由人工氣胸術可迅速或徐徐玉降。</p>
<p>（二）結核毒性症狀（盜汁。頭痛。心悸亢進。食慾不振。體重减輕等）之消退。氣胸作成後。盜汁。頭痛得以消朱。睡眠狀態得以改善。食慾及體重得以增進。月經得復見來潮。</p>
<p>（三）呼吸困難减輕。氣胸作成之初期因氣胸而肺内之呼吸面减少。又發生呼吸困難。後由其他肺之代償機能亢進。比之氣胸作成前之程度。漸次减輕。以至消失。</p>
<p>（四）心臟營養增進。因發熱及一般症狀之消退。心筋之營養得以恢復。於是脈搏之性質反轉良好。</p>
<p>人工氣胸作成後患惻肺部呈萎縮狀態。肺内淋巴流之停止是當然之結果。結核菌在肺内產生一種毒素。發生結核毒性症狀。消耗體力爲害至大。今因病部的淋巴流停止。該毒素局限的滯溜於一部分。不輸入於血液内。不發生結核毒症狀。所以（一）項至（四）項之效力。不得不歸功於此也。</p>
<p>（五）咳嗽及咳痰輕快或消失。因肺萎縮之純機能的作用。空洞及氣道遂縮小而狹隘。故氣胸作成後數日間。咳嗽咳痰量及痰内之結核菌反增加係自然之結果。此後卽見咳痰量减少。性質由膿性漸次變爲粘液膿性。而至純粘液性。終而至無痰。痰内之結核菌與喀痰量同時减少。而至無菌。可知人工氣胸在肺病之預防上。爲極有益之手術。</p>
<p>（六）肺出血停止。人工氣胸術對肺出血爲直接救命療法。因肺之萎縮壓迫。安靜。空洞縮小等。都於止用作用有極好之效果。對最不容易止血之空洞性出血。爲效更顯著。</p>
<p>以上所述各種之效果。係指完全氣胸而言。完全氣胸者。肺臟由人工氣胸術之結果。縮小至肺門部至相當容量之謂也。故肺肋膜與胸壁肋膜有粘着時。人工氣胸之適當壓力。若不能將此兩部分脫離。則肺臟各部分不能平均萎縮。卽所謂不完全氣胸術是也。不完全氣胸術與完全氣胸術之成績不同。卽以止用效用而言。倘出血適在粘着部。該部不能因人工氣胸而脫離。而至萎縮則止血之效自然不能達到矣。</p>
<h3>書「上海市醫師公會診金規定草案」後</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>上海醫師公會，根據從前大會製定本會診金規律一提案「最近由宋國賓醫師草成診金最低率規定全份，印一小冊分寄會員，徵求意見。這件事一方面是維持正式醫師權利必然的工作，應該由本身職業團體來公同規定的；另一方面也是社會上一件值得注意的事。無論那一個人，决不能說永遠不會生病和醫師不發生關係的，從前的屢歉診金和故意减付診金等種種惡習，是必須改除的；再則草案全份，是否爲最低率，爲中流階級可能擔負的，這種種問題，都在研究討論之列。所以我覺得這件事應該使一般社會人士家諭戶曉，决不是規定自規定，惡習還是惡習，實行像「海上神山可望而不可卽」一樣，結果完全寫成紙上的具文。</p>
<p>關於這草案，是否爲最低率？是否爲中流階級所可擔負？這二問題，放在後面討論。在原草案前有原則八條，我覺得全社會的人們，都有一讀的必要。現在且照抄在下面：</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>（一）凡屬本會醫師，俱有接受診金之權。</p>
<p>（二）除貧病不計外，本會視本市目下地方之生活程度情形，製訂下列之診金最低率標準規定，以適應一般中流階級人士。</p>
<p>（三）凡屬本會會員，不得製訂診例出於公議限度之下，而爲非道義之競爭。</p>
<p>（四）病情千變萬化，「包醫」在禁例之條。</p>
<p>（五）普通診視外，有需爲器械之特別檢查，或治療者，須加倍收費。</p>
<p>（六）會診之時，會診醫師之診費，當較常診醫師診費爲高。</p>
<p>（七）對於屢欠診金之病家，有所延請，得以謝絕。</p>
<p>這幾條原則，對於維持醫師本身最低率診金權利，當然是不能不公訂的。我們曉得，在現在社會病家對待醫師的情形，是非常複雜的。屢欠診金和故意不付或减付的事實非常多的；也有因病人已故，卽不付過去之診金，有時醫師不過最初診過數次，末後由他醫診治，而亦罹不付診金之損失；甚至因醫師索舊欠之診金，而藉故以玩忽業務之罪控告者。結果就使法院有公正的判决，那在社會上面地位和名譽，總不免要受些影響的。像這樣情形，我想每一個醫師，就是沒有身受，耳聽的實例，大槪都不在少處罷！但是反過一看，大多數非正式的醫生，學書不成學劍不成的份子，他們以最低價格藉慈善二字爲號召，以白濁或肺癆專家爲招牌，以包醫一名詞爲欺騙病家之工具。到了一有急性病發生，祇須病家認爲非常危險，他們在這機會，也可以在診金以外，索取鉅額之金錢。有些極普通手術，所索費用，恐怕比這本草案上所規定，不止一二十倍呢！卽據我所知道的，有一位白濁專家醫生，他的門診診金不過一元，但每次連購藥，差不多須十五元以上；其中不費任何重要手術，是可想得到的。那這一種價目，非一般中流階級所可擔任，是不言而喻的了！所以這一份草案，對於保障醫師本身之當然權利，固無須說；卽一般病家看了，也可以曉得醫師勞力最低之報酬如是如是。使種種五花八門騙術無所施其技，我想爲補當然也不在少的。</p>
<p>復次，假使這一份草案，到了社會一般人的手中，他們大槪是什麼樣的見解呢？這一問題，當然很植得提出的。我的預測是：對於現在社會能全部認清的人物，當然不會加以誹議的；但這是最少數。另外的大多數，大槪都不很了解的。他們覺得醫師診病，是一種慈善性質，診金多少，是不能計較的；形之紙墨，已嫌過火，今竟有不得訂診例出於公議限度之下之規定，其行爲有類市儈。這一種眼光，是拿中國傳統的倫理學來限制個人，完全不認識現實社會整個的情形的。普通醫師診例，向有貧病不計一條，對於非貧苦階級，當然是不能享受的。所以對於慈善爲懷一層，是完全無理由的。他們這種見解，我個人另在一點感想。無論那一個人，祇須在現在社會生活的，當然衣食上最低限度，是勢在必解决的；那當然非需金錢不可。但我覺得西洋人的要錢是明的；惟有中國人的性格，最怕人說他要錢，卽使骨子裹非常想要，但終不輕容易形之於口的。晋朝的王夷甫口不言錢，是一個很明確的先例。到了後來的書畫家，有自訂的潤格了，清朝的鄭板橋，甚至有「凡送禮物食物，總不如白銀爲妙；」及「賒文尤屬賴賬；」等豪語；但一般人覺得這是名士風流，可一而不可再，別人决不能效尤的。一直到了現在，這一種「遺風餘韻」，在一般人心目中，還保存着一二。對於醫師這一職業，震於往日醫乃仁術良相良醫這一套語，總覺得和商人有些不同，不應該惟利是視，計較多寡的。不知道我們總究是個人，並且是現實社會上的一個人，旣不能「跳出三界外，不在五行中；」也不是「不沾染人間烟火氣的」。所以我預測一般人對此草案之見解，大半是誤解的。但這種不認識現實社會的眼光，我們當然是不能顧慮的。（未完）</p>
<h3>再談白濁菌　（續）</h3>
<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>這談話的末一段，作者想來談談生白濁症的身體的免疫情形，（卽抵抗力）上面已經說過，白濁症是一個人類的特有症，其他動物都不生此病。（除了幾次用人工方法傳染到動物身上之外）所以有許多學者認爲動物身體之内，終有些特種的抵抗白濁菌的抵抗力，這個思想亦不是全無證據的。例如吾人在人工培養此病菌的時候，用人血清作養料，確較任何其他動物性的血清爲優。那末這人血清確對於白濁菌是一種好食品，同時更相到人的身體，對於這白濁菌，具有特種的感受性。但是各個部位與性別及年紀，均呈不同的變化，年幼的陰戶對此菌是非常容易染着，年長無病的確不能染着此病，在同一身體之上，眼的黏膜是較尿管黏膜不易染菌，（指長者）惟年幼者的眼膜，確又狠容易染着此病。此種例規，又可各隨外界情形而有變動，綜之吾們可以說，人類的身子是沒有甚麼的確的「天然免疫力」，來拒絕這白濁症之侵入。</p>
<p>除了這天然免疫性之外，吾們尙想到如故一個人生過一次白濁之後，是否與其他幾種毛病相同，可以抵抗第二次的染着，（例如傷寒天花等等）這個問題「病後免疫」適得着否的回覆。雖然生白濁病的人們，可以證明說他在第二次生病的時候，其痛苦遠不如在第一次的大，但是在科學方面到今日而未說定這個情形是一種病後產生的免疫，（有幾位認他爲一種局部的免疫，但是從力量方面去探看，假使卽是眞的「局部免疫」，那末亦是很薄弱的。所以尙有人認牠不過是一種比較大些的習慣性而已，）因爲究竟是不能幸免了，二次毛病的發生，旣然如此，所以如用人工製造的苗液，當然亦無甚魔預防的能力，這所謂的「人工免疫」。（在夏季的霍亂苗注射亦屬乎此），在今日實用方面，確占有重大的價值，卽是牠的治療的作用，究竟這效力，是否全然是一種免疫性的呢，抑是一種普通的刺激治療，這個問題，雖是沒有一定的學說，但作者確相信牠是具有上述的二種作用，致於人工的苗液（卽用白濁菌弄死後做成的注射液），及活的白濁菌，到了身體之内，發生如何的抵抗作用，這是因爲屬於太專門的東西，作者不便多說。但是吾們確能利用此種抵抗作用所發見的反應，（白濁血清反應），來作診斷白濁症之用，（指慢性的及複病性的）在今日已得若干專家的贊許，但是亦不能不同時求助於臨床家之相助，以期達到着一個鳥瞰式的全景診斷。（治療經地，病象觀察經過，及其歷來的其他檢查結果等等）</p>
<p>在各種治療藥品之外，白濁症亦有白濁血清的製造，雖然牠的治療的效率，不是此談話所應談的東西，但是在免疫學學理方面，牠是屬於『被動的免疫』，與上述的各種『自動性的免疫』，適成針鋒相對的二種免疫區別。</p>

<p>吾人欲測知體溫。固甚易易。祇須將檢溫器嚴密消毒後。插入患者舌下。或腋窩肛門等處。而斷定其熱之高下。惟肛門熱度。平常較口中爲高。而腋窩之熱度。則又略低於口中焉。又飯後測溫往往有較平時高半度或半度以上者。是又不可不知也。體溫上昇三十七五至三十八度者。名曰次熱。三十八度至三十八度五分者。名曰輕熱。三十八度五分至三十九度五分者。名曰中熱。三十九度五分至四十度五分者。名曰高熱。四十度五分以上者名曰劇熱。四十二度以上者。名曰死熱。夫熱爲抵抗病原而發。故輕熱可任之。不必亂用退熱等劑。惟高熱日久。纏綿不退。則對於血行。神經。消化。呼吸。排洩。等器官。大起障害。而組織亦起異常之變化焉。茲將各器官之病變列下。</p>
<p>（一）血行障害　乃由於體溫亢進。與病毒而起。此外迷走神經亦興奮異常。脈搏頻繁。常現重複脈。心力與血壓無常。大抵初期脈搏大而且實。若至末期。則心力及血壓減衰。脈搏小而虛軟。</p>
<p>（二）神經障害　體溫旣亢進之後。體内該病原所產生之毒素。刺激神經。而發現精神不安。全身倦怠。頭痛昏眩。或感覺銳敏。或夜不安眠。或發瞻語。或呈興奮狀態。小兒則兼有痙攣。凡體溫高。則神經之障害亦愈甚焉。</p>
<p>（三）消化障害　體溫亢進之後。則各種消化消之分量及胃之消化力均因之減少。而起消化不良。舌苔。便秘。味覺變常。口内乾燥。胃粘膜過敏。常起嘔吐。此等消化障害。除體溫亢進外。與毒物之作用。亦大有關係焉。</p>
<p>（四）呼吸障害　最著者。爲呼吸頻數。是由血溫之亢進。而與熱之高低。相平行者也。</p>
<p>（五）排洩障害　尿量減少。色濃而比重高。常含有尿酸及尿酸鹽垽殿。劇熱時尿中常含有蛋白質及阿采頓等。尿素常增加至常量二三倍以上。食鹽則減少。皮膚水分及炭酸之排洩增加。汗之分泌於極進期缺亡者。多於分利時增加云。</p>
<p>（六）組織變化　脈及肌肉混濁腫脹。或呈脂方變性。赤血球崩壞而減少。組織成分之燃燒增進。因營養障害而易起炎性病及壞疽等。</p>
<p>熱之輕者。往往易治。重者則治之甚難。蓋高熱纏綿不絕。各種器官均發生障害。漸漸由高熱之下。因心力衰弱而死亡云。（完）</p>
<h3>肺病用煤油治愈之實騐</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>肺病因飲煤油而治愈之事實，陸續發現於各地。某人本欲飲煤油自殺，反而將肺病治愈，又某地方委員，亦曾試飲，成績果佳等等事實，從前祇屬民間療法之飲煤油時代，今日已成過去，據今所得報告。正式醫家，使患者試服，不但可治愈肺病，並可治愈重症之喉頭結核，痔瘺，脊椎骨瘍，等結核性病症，尙有糠尿病，喘息，亦可治愈。</p>
<p>日本本亦世界聞名之結核國，年年爲結核菌之犧牲者，不下十一二萬人，雖曰其醫學年有進步，醫療機關日臻完備，然結核患者之數字，仍隨人口之增加而益多。</p>
<p>自德國古霍博士發見結核菌以來，世界學者爲殲滅結核菌，曾發表有許多葉物，並曾有無數嘗試，然而至於今日，仍未能發明無害有效之妙藥，結局以肺病爲非藥所能治，祇有安靜，祇有轉地，祇有營養，祇有自然療法，爲最後所有之治療法，今日之多數醫家，皆唱道自然療法。</p>
<p>在此地上，果無可治肺病之妙藥乎？寶玉深藏於地中，能將其掘出，非最有趣之人生乎。</p>
<p>向來祇視爲燃料之煤油，今已成爲安全飲料，而且爲撲滅結核菌之最佳妙藥，眞出人意外！</p>
<p>醫學博士速水寅一氏，理學博士岩本義虎氏醫學士松尾等氏，同木村佐太雄氏，同木下政市氏，同千葉將喜氏等，此外尙有許多之醫師化學者，或從臨床上，或從動物試騐，或行愛克司光等之理化學試騐，或行煤油之分析化學試騐，各自分擔研究，一方又有川崎造船廠，神戶製鋼廠等之大羣人員及工人，作大規模之對照試服，已有幾千之實騐例，見於日本全國。</p>
<p>東京主婦之友雜誌記者特往見上述之專門醫家及學者，請其公表其貴重之研究，又往訪川崎，神戶兩製鋼廠之保健組合及其他各處，聽實騐者之談話，今原原本本，記述於下。</p>
<p>（一）試之百人幾於百人皆有效果之煤油療法之成績（實騐者　　數百人之中結果不佳者祇有一人）</p>
<p>據日本兵庫縣立兒童研究所長醫學堂博士，速水寅一的報告：當我聞煤油可治肺病，感到非常興趣。因我知煤油用作乳劑，爲强力之殺菌劑，而且飲之又無害，從種種事實推測，心想此或爲極有力之發見故也。</p>
<p>我曾聞俄國人及愛司基摩人中，自昔時卽有人用煤油以代酒飲，又聞日本岡山縣曾有富翁家道中落，至於不能購酒，試飲煤油，身體大見健康，活至一百幾歲，又聞日本山口縣，下松之煤油公司凡在工廠做工者，從未見肺病，辦事人員，有肺病者，一往工廠勞働，病亦卽愈，因此我卽急欲自己試騐，先視其害之有無。</p>
<p>我雖不患肺病，但吸香烟太過，卽發咳嗽，因乘其時每次飲下煤油三十瓦（一勺半餘）飲下數次。結果不但胃腸腎臟皆無何害，反而翌日食慾大增，咳亦全止，故我知煤油用作袪痰劑，亦極有效果，我復欲試騐煤油之殺菌力，將結核菌放入培養基，滴下薄之煤油一滴，結核菌全然死滅。現正再就天竺鼠及兎，續行試騐，所得成績容當在醫學會發表，現在恕未能奉告。</p>
<p>總之，經過動物試騐，愈信其安全有效，故我每遇到肺病病人，卽勸其試服，得有多數之治愈例，請爲述其一二。有某學校助教Ａ氏（二十七歲）兩肺皆患肺病，過去六年間，凡所有療法，無不嘗試，然病勢祇一進一退，已自分難望全愈，及飲煤油，每次飲十五瓦至二十瓦，隔二日至一星期飲用，共飲六次，已恢復至將近全治。</p>
<p>又有商科大學學生Ｋ君（二十二歲）由校醫及某博士診爲肺尖加答兒，兩肩表裹，據云皆聽到水泡音，祇飲煤油二次，卽祇有一個有水泡音，而且已極縮�</p>
<p>小，元氣亦迅速恢復，其後亦卽全治。又我之朋友中，有人患脊椎骨瘍，亦祇飲煤油數次，今年已能赴海水浴，卽我研究所之僕人，患糖尿病，亦飲煤油治愈。</p>
<p>凡由我教以飲法而得到良結果者，至今約有幾百人，其成績之佳，近於百分之百云。</p>
<p>祇有一例，係一年四十八歲男子，兩肺皆發肺病而又併發腎臟病及脚氣，極其衰弱，飲煤油後，翌日卽覺精神爽快，胃口亦開，正自歡喜，忽由脚氣衝心而死，此究由何原因，雖不明瞭，其可嘆之例，祇此一人，其他則皆得到可喜結果。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>飲用方法由年齡體格等，而有多少增减，大抵最初可自十瓦程度開始，漸增至十五瓦左右，以飲少量而增多次數較爲安全。（煤油每次飲十瓦，不及小酒杯半杯，可用西藥房之量水杯量之最便）</p>
<p>飲煤油時刻，以夜間九時左右爲宜，可廢去晚餐，於睡前飲之第二次隔四日或五日再飲，自第三次起，隔五日至一星期飲之。</p>
<p>煤油並不難飲，不過不在空腹時飲，有時或致嘔吐。</p>
<p>川崎造船廠工人，有人曾一次飲下五十瓦亦未有害。對於其副作用，今所知者爲第一次飲下後，大都下痢，又飲下分量過多，可致喉痛聲嗄，惟此皆祇係一時現象，放置之亦卽自愈。尤以下痢之後，食慾卽增，精神爽快，乃曾飲煤油者所同承認。煤油之種類，無論何種皆佳，似以不甚上等之煤油爲佳。雖亦係從煤油製造之物，如揮發油。飲之則有害，應絕對避免。（未完）</p>

<h3>其故</h3>
<p>— 澄</p>
<p>這次在上海所開的西湖藝專展覽會，無疑地已給與沉寂的藝壇一個新的刺激。本刊日來收到關於該會之批評文字甚多，因限於篇幅，未能儘量發表，茲特從表示滿意與不滿意兩種投稿中各選一篇登出，以示觀者意見之一斑。　編者</p>
<p>三月裹上海開過了兩次美術展覽會，一個是幾個私人兜賣作品的，一個來自杭州。懷誠謹之心情去參觀了，但得混沌而歸，心裹想：這種畫我不要看的。但其中蕭屋泉與齊白石的寥寥幾張作品，依然可觀，給與人比較深刻的印象。</p>
<p>藝術之事，良不可誣。勿謂中國社會無人，眞假美醜其實昭然如日光，許多人心知其故，但不知說出。成名的偉大，非偶然；假冒的大名，只可欺愚者。前者永久，後者只可支持暫時。無論海派京派，印象表現，立體卽物，這道理是對的。</p>
<p>現在我們學西洋畫，成績甚佳。在一二十年中能有這麼好的結果，是國畫家應該佩服的，他們未必如此用力。這是就學習方面言。然而作品呢，大都可有可無，浮光掠影，魂氣皆弱，不知所云。因畫片照抄或摹擬的，更使人感到虛僞和假冒，難堪！</p>
<p>其故，在於中國現代不懂西洋藝術，藝術家更不懂藝術。藝術家旣不懂藝術，當然不懂藝術本質和生命。形骸内無物，無技巧和内容；形骸外尤無物，無思想，個性，人格，靈魂。法理旣無，何有於道；形影未具，何有於神？遠之不能比西歐作家，近之不能與國畫媲美，－－可算很痛苦之事。</p>
<p>這不能歸咎於現代青年藝術家，應歸咎於指導者，多少天才給教壞了。然指導者不足責，因爲東西方如此遙遠，我們沒有方法看到眞本西洋藝術。印刷工藝影像工藝皆不發達，副本也難看到，所以也只能混沌，朦朧。東西方民族，文化，傳統，如此不同，這種生命之最高表現難於相合，也無足怪。</p>
<h3>西湖藝專畫展的一瞥</h3>
<p>— 克</p>
<p>中國藝術界是在九一八以後忽然熱鬧了起來的，這似乎頗出人意料。單就上海一隅說，近年來的什麼展覽會眞如「雨後春筍」，「層出不窮」。今年的陽春才到，國立藝專第四屆美展又在上海中法友誼會開始了。春天是可愛的，在這樣的佳節又有美術展覽會看，那更是使人感謝。雖然，對於要整天做事的人們大約並不相干。</p>
<p>這回藝專的美展，單說量一方面，就着實可驚。連地板上，樓梯口，都藝術底地擺滿了作品。圖案畫是藝專素負盛名的，大家佩服，用不着我多言。林風眠先生的改良國畫，眞是大膽得可以，顏色和筆觸，都取法西洋，這對於所謂「國畫家」，實在很像給了一個當頭棒，要打得他們搖頭幌腦的。還有孫福煕先生畫的菊花，除了「豈甘低頭」一幅是「輕描淡寫」外，都「布局嚴謹」，「描寫細膩」，實在比他的「典型的小品文」高明多了。談到油畫，「佳作」自然應該說特別多。其中吳大羽先生的人體，肖像和靜物，使我覺得中國並非全沒有技術純熟的畫家；蔡威廉女士給她的丈夫林文錚先生畫的肖像，也是很能引人注意的作品。</p>
<p>現在說話是很難討好的，其餘的作品還是少談的好吧。不過，在這裹，我還想特別提出來說一下的，是這次展覽會裹新發現了一種「漆畫」，這是利用一種加色的漆料，在布面或板面上去表現各樣的形象，有時甚而至於堆砌起來，儼然像浮彫的。大約是因爲漆的粘性特別强之故吧，掃刷起來也特別有力量，例如朱賢壽君的「路工」，蔣鴻達君的「馳馬」，就都能激起人的緊張的情緒。我想，這樣的東西在形式上雖與木刻很不同，但它的效果也未必沒有木刻那麼大。我十分希望藝專的同學們，對於漆畫更加努力去研究：凡是關心於藝術的人們，倘有時間，也不妨加以討論的。我們知道，凡是大藝術家們所鄙棄的東西，往往就是極好的藝術，譬之木刻，便是一個極好的例證了。</p>
<p>[P論失眠之益</p>
<p>— 馬國亮</p>
<p>晚上，躺在床上，腦裹不絕地想東想西。不久之後，你發覺今夜有點蹊蹺，翻來覆去，總是不能入睡。於是你心裹念念有辭，數着一，二，三，四……不行，你又專心聽着時鐘的特的特的聲響……不行。你起來找一本艱深難讀的書，看了兩三頁，頭腦有點發昏，乘機拋開書本，眼情閉上，但不久，你仍覺得無效，彷彿撤沙老人今夜把你遺忘了似的。於是你又再起床，伸手動脚的做做室内柔軟體操，直至你筋疲力倦了，你重倒在床上，但是依然不行，不行！</p>
<p>唉—你會這樣地嘆息起來，因爲你知道今夜要失眠了。</p>
<p>但是偶然的失眠是一件可嘆息的事嗎？</p>
<p>我以爲未必。</p>
<p>在這些緊張的日子裹，我們最常發出的怨言就是：這世界是太大，太複雜了。原因是我們所有的不過是一個小小的腦袋，而日常接觸和應付的事物太多，使我們的記憶和思想的力量不够分配。結果便是我們有感覺這世界是太複雜的怨言。</p>
<p>是的，在日常裹，我們整天的做着機械的工作，要有點時間和機會來記憶一點什麼，思想一點什麼，這簡直是不可能。你以爲晚上回到家裹，晚飯後，黠一枝香烟，躺在舒服的椅裹，你便可以如願以償了嗎？除非你是補放逐在荒島裹，否則，當你正在靜靜地相得入神的時候，你能够担保你的小弟弟，你的夫人，或你的孩子，絕對不會來打攪你的思潮嗎？還有那些來訪的不速之客，或是街上那些呌賣者的呼聲呢？</p>
<p>偶然的失眠就是那應運而生的最妥善的補救方法。平常我們晚上倒在床上，立刻沉沉入夢，於是見周公，會孔子，或升天堂，或入地獄，或無所不往。然而於個人的事業上，却無所帮忙古人雖有夢中得佳句的韻事，但這太無把握。若無夢熟睡，雖說第二天起來精神充足，然而人事紛紜，一天固定的必須工作又擺在面前。我們至多可以說是更有精神來應付那些機械的工作，却沒理由來說我們便可以有機會來細細記憶，細細思想。充足的精神衹能給我們以更大的工作的精力，却不能給我們以時間和機會來作更精細縝密的思量的。</p>
<p>倘若是失眠—呵，那機會來了。在午夜裹，一切的人們，連了世界的萬物，都熟睡了，週遭靜寂無聲，這時候，你旣完全不受驚擾，獨有你一個人在失眠，這是一個值得感謝上天的機會。你可趁這時候來想想你的工作，你的事業的計劃，想想你在日常的記憶中遺忘了的朋友。想想那些早知該做而你却忘記了的事情。並且在這時候裹，你會臨時發現許多你從來所想不到的事業，和計劃。如其你正在籌劃一椿事情，在你經過了一夜的失眠的熟思之後，明天起來，你定會驚奇地發覺那一夜失眠的收獲是多麼地出乎你自己的意料的。</p>
<p>我們不是常常聽過或讀過，那歷史上許多有名的人們因了幾夜的苦思而獲到了事業上的成功的故事嗎？那「幾夜的苦思」就是失眠。我敢斷言，如果一個著作家在著作某一本書的時候時常失眠，則將來這一定是本更好的著作。同樣地，如果一個科學家能有失眠的機會，他必定會在更短的時間内達到他研究的目的。</p>
<p>不久以前，曾在某外國雜誌上看見一段賣補血藥的廣告。牠用特大的字號來標着說世界不好的原因，是因爲世界是被統治在一班身體不康健的人們的手上，所以牠說要世界好，必須服用他的補血藥，使身體强健，而後頭腦清楚，而後世界大治。</p>
<p>這廣告措詞雖佳，却未免近乎幽默，彷彿有點諷刺。我却以爲世界不好的原因，就是因爲治世者的身體補養得太好，以致晚上倒在床上，立刻熟睡，未能失眠。如不回家卽睡，精神充足，也必定宴遊終夜，亦决無失眠的機會，旣無失眠，則天下不能太平，自在意中。</p>
<p>失眠之益，旣如上述。我說，倘若你每夜失眠，便應該去請教醫生，或服一二安眠藥片。倘若你從來不曾失眠，則應於每一個月中，選擇某一個星期六的晚上（這樣明天你遲起來一點也不要緊），多喝幾杯濃咖啡，早早地躺在床上，等候「失眠」降臨在你的身上。至若能够自動的偶然失眠，則你直應感謝你自已和上帝了。</p>
<p>人人能有偶然的失眠，則世界一切的進步，定有驚人的記錄，天下太平，更必指日可期。調余不信，請嘗試之。</p>
<h3>詩經試譯</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>江有汜</p>
<p>一大江裹有回流的急水。你出嫁的姑娘，给我一個不理。给我一個不理，也許將來你要後悔！</p>
<p>二大江裹有洲一樣的灘。你出嫁的姑娘，給我一個難堪。給我一個難堪，也許將來我們同頑！</p>
<p>三大江裹容得支流別派。你出嫁的姑娘，給我一個不睬。給我一個不睬，只好唱個歌兒寬解！</p>
<h3>書話</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>每逢亂世，書籍總會和被欺壓的人們一樣，到處受着災害。據高珩（葱珮）言，當明季「淄城陷時，薪楚並是詩書。泥淖則以爲履，戰鬥則以爲甲」（與周减齊），不過這現象，並非止於明季，是無時不然的。想到一書搜輯網羅之不易，看它付諸浩刧，眞不禁爲之感歎。大槪書之仇敵，是不外兵災，火災，及蠹魚的。火災對於書之殘酷，於絳雲樓之一焚，可以見之。兵災的影響，是例證更多。至於蠹魚，鄧汝高（原岳）云：「蠹魚殊酷欺先生久客，將西樓藏書，飽瞰無餘。昨乃摉其種，聚族而焚之，恨不能極吾兵威也」（與徐惟和），亦是一趣例。每見舊家書籍，爲蠹魚所嗜，殘缺不完，至往往有不能窺見著作全璧之恨，其心理上的現象，與汝高所言，正相似也。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>兵災對於書籍之影響，陳宏緒（大業）自述，亦足爲一有力之證據。其言曰：「某自乙酉入山，輦載所藏書，不下數萬卷。鐵騎一來，屯剳於敝居石河。一勺一粒，一絲一縷俱盡。而所藏書悉被割剝撕扯，裂作紙甲數千；煤痕丹點，離離駃騠之背；餘以支枕籍地，數萬縹緗，淪於一旦。生平所輯，有「明文類抄」一書，三十年訪求於南北詩文，羅網幾盡。卷帙與文苑英華相等，今亦付之流水矣。」以下他還繼續敘述了一些原稿的散失。兵災對於書籍的厄運，其影響眞是有難言者。</p>
<h3>編輯室</h3>
<p>本刊以後擬常載新體詩歌及民間謠曲等，每首致酬由五角至二元。</p>
<p>又饒有興趣之漫畫亦所歡迎，每幅致酬最少一元。</p>
<p>惟來稿不論採用與否，槪不退還。稿内請勿附寄郵票。</p>
<h3>暮（二）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>心中自覺着有無限的疚恨，做父親的人，不敢去看女兒的臉，只一個人焦灼着，憂愁着，想着如何再由自己的乎把女兒所忍受的苦消滅。</p>
<p>——我若是在這社會裹沒有聲名，也沒有錢，那就容易了！</p>
<p>但是，凌空的幻想，是沒有一點用；空使他增了幾華的髪，臉上多了一兩條縐紋而已。他這是只能垂了頭，吐着長長的嘆息。</p>
<p>第次聽到妻和女兒們來說青松的幽凄的情况，就好像用钝的刀，来割着他的心。就是容忍着，不大聲地呌出來，那眼淚也要像珠子一樣地，在他那滿了縐紋的臉上掛下來。這時候，他最愛的兒子青石，就能得了信，趕來勸着他到花園裹散散步，或是起始着其他的談話，使他暫時地把這件事忘掉。</p>
<p>「總得要想想法子，像這樣松姑兒是不能活下去的。」</p>
<p>私下裹，母親和青枝時常說到這樣的話。雖然是常說着，也不敢把這話和她們的父親來說：可是從觀察中，也就能清晰地看到，他自己也每天在思慮着這件事。</p>
<p>避開了大的周折，解决了小的煩難，就把青松，在一年之後，迎到了母家來住。</p>
<p>但是在青松的心中，雖然是回到了生長十九年的家中，總自己覺着一種說不出的差異。在本身上，一個婦人，一個死了丈夫的婦人，就只該沉靜靜地；在別人那一面，雖然說是對於嫁了的女兒的一種應有的恭敬，在青松的心裹，却容容易易地想到了那是冷淡。</p>
<p>只有青枝對她和從前一樣，甚至於比從前還要好一些的。青枝終日伴了她從一個早晨到一個早晨，如以前一樣，就是在睡着的時候，也不離開。當着她稍稍爲寂寞之感所苦，青枝是更靈敏地覺察到，就過去和她相儇地坐着。</p>
<p>她們默默地握着手，讓眼淚自然地籠罩了眼睛，像將吐盡胸中所有的鬰悶，青松大大地嘆息着。</p>
<p>於是她們把眼睛抬起來失望地互視着，青枝緩緩地說：</p>
<p>「不要常是這樣悲傷，二妹，住到家中來我們不是可以天天相依麼？」</p>
<p>青松立刻露了懷疑的眼光，她微微地搖着頭，想着這不過全然是姊姊的好心，說來給她暫時安慰的。</p>
<p>「姊姊總該有嫁到人家的一天—」</p>
<p>「什麼，二妹，」青枝的臉，有一點紅起來了。「我不願意有任何男人來做我的丈夫，我要陪伴了你。陪伴了妹妹來消磨這一生。」</p>
<p>說着的時候，青枝的聲音在抖着，她的臉更紅漲起一點來，爲這純眞的情感激蕩着，身軀都微微地顫動。</p>
<p>「呵，我的親姊姊……」</p>
<p>青松的淚被感動得滿了臉，抱了青枝在傷慟地哭着。</p>

<h3>夾忙來談談銀價</h3>
<p>— 寰澄</p>
<p>三年以前，（民國二十年）我曾爲中社同人邀講金銀問題。當時銀價狂跌，國人皇皇如也！說用銀國的財產，暗中打了個倒三四折，更要窮得不得了。亦有人說；全世界把銀當作垃圾看待。我們用銀國，不啻承受全世界的垃圾，。我的講稿，（曾刊登新社會第一第二卷，並有單行本）中，曾說過這樣幾句話。現在舊話重提，先來引證一下：</p>
<p>「我國受金貴銀賤之影響，究竟怎麼樣？我可以回答一句；徼天之幸，並沒有大損害，而且有些地方，或者還因以爲利。如其能彀勉力生產，自給自足。卽使銀價長此疲跌，祇要不大起大落，社會上並不覺得何種害處。（中略）假使現在銀價，驟然回漲。不要說回到一九一九，二十年之銀價，卽回到一九廿，七八年之銀價，（廿六七辨土）已足使我國惹起恐慌。新興工廠，必定有多數關門。特價大跌，商家亦必受大損失。所利者，不過一部分進口商而已。銀價跌落，利害是相對的。我們能使生產力旺盛。說不定還利多於害。銀價不定，是絕對的有害無利。或者極少數幸運的投機商，可以說他是利。爲我國打算，與其說提高銀價，或維持銀價，還不如說穩定銀價。如銀價爲國際共同之事，非我一國所能主持。我們就得想法，如何穩定對外之滙兌率？」</p>
<p>光陰忽忽，糊裹糊塗，過了三年。我國上下軍民人等，從沒想到穩定對外匯兌率這一件事。直到如今，美國大吵提高銀價，國人又皇皇如也，再來一個恐慌潮頭。報紙上談銀價的文章，從新熱鬧起來。我亦不免夾在忙碌碌大衆堆裹，來謅幾的。</p>
<p>開頭第一句；就請大家不要驚慌！銀價實在漲得甚少，現在未見得會驟然大漲。如若未雨綢繆，仍須注重穩定對外匯兌率。</p>
<p>何以說銀價漲得甚少？因爲眞正國際銀價，要用黃金計算，不是用紙幣計算。紙幣是各國不同，不能作爲標準。金業交易所的標金，跟着美金揭價，實際已脫離金的性質。所以跌價很多。我國商業上，對外匯兌，以英美日三國爲最多。這三國先後放棄金本位，不能以他們貨幣跌價，就算銀價回漲。美國遠期銀價，現市每盎司四角六七分。把美金减成的五九○六折算，實在還不到二角八分。近三年中，美國未放棄金本位時，銀價亦曾到過三角以外。二角八分的銀價，算漲得多少？實實在在，銀價還是「外甥提燈籠，照舊。」</p>
<p>何以現在銀價未見得會驟然大漲？看了美國議員的提案，眞要嚇煞人。金一銀十六的比價，收買十萬萬盎司，每月購進五千萬盎司，種種花樣，究竟帶有幾分實行性？却不容易弄得明白。眞正銀價，是帶有國際性的。以美國一國，來抬高全世界銀價，就使做得到，羅斯福總統，對於白銀，並沒有切身利害，何苦於藍鷹運動，復興計畫，忙得不可開交時候，再來這一椿化錢費力的麻煩事情。從前頒布銀幣法案，本國自產的銀，定了六角四分半的買價。已算對帮忙選舉的銀鑛家，有了一個交代。以後，就懶洋洋的對銀案沒有勁。將來或許被議員吵不過，再收買國内市塲上一些存銀。（紐約市存銀約二萬萬盎司，多在投機家手中，）就使被他收買一空，如不繼續收買，全世界銀價，因爲去年銀產額漸漸加多，（據美國銀統計；一九三一年，每月平均產額，一千三百二十一萬三千盎司，一九三二年，一千四百○六萬一千盎司，今年正月分，一千四百四十四萬四千盎司，）而銷銀大主顧中國與印度，銷塲日少。印度國庫内存銀，照銀協定每年尙有三千五百萬可以售出。其他各國，並沒有一國，同美國這樣對白銀有興味。德國前數年，鑄過銀輔幣。去年又鎔了向市上出賣。如果這種情勢，沒有改變，卽使美政府把市上存銀買完了，亦祇是提高了國内銀價，對他國沒有影響。你要買，人家落得賣與你。結果胃口塞飽了，自然要討饒。我看美國買進黃金的胃口，比買進白銀强得多。未必來做個白銀無限公司，儘量收買全世界的笨貨。所以眞正銀價，非得國際上聯絡幾個有力量的國家來用銀幣，不能彀驟然大漲。除非東方發生戰事，（戰事持久纔有影響）或現行金本位各國，如法荷瑞意等，全放棄了金本位，不會生大發動。從前主張抬高銀價的人，多說恢復東方用銀民族的購買力，可以使世界還到景氣。現在此說，漸漸拆穿。東方民族的購買力，不單靠在銀價上。新近上海銀行界及各國僑商致美電報，更拆得七穿八洞。未免把銀派人員，澆了一斛冷水。就銀價論銀價，祇是美國議員在那裹吵，未見得十分樂觀。不過各國滙率的漲落，另是一個問題。如其美國再用膨脹政策，美滙再跌落，那是滙率問題，與銀價全不相干。</p>
<p>何以未雨綢繆，須注重穩定對外匯率？我國的金融，眞彀苦了！銀價跌皇皇如也！銀價涨，又要皇皇如也！跟着人家脚跟移轉，一輩子不得出頭。我主張全世界銀價能彀穩定，就應該在國際做工夫，不單是這種空洞銀協定所能濟用。國際上沒有穩定辦法，就應該自己打算：設立强有力的對外匯兌機關，再用銀稅調劑其間。使我國幣價，不完全受着國外銀價影響，而能平均國内的物價。「老壽星唱曲子，總是老調，」不論銀跌銀漲，我還是用一個穩定藥方。三年前講稿中，已經說得多了，此次無須再說。</p>
<p>現在大衆最怕的，是國外銀價一漲，上海存銀，就要向外跑。假使早有一個强有力的滙兌機關，在國内外銀價平衡之時，預先向倫敦紐約，購定期銀，而在上海購進英美遠期匯票。一遇國内銀價將近輸出點時，（國内銀價，加運費保險雜費等，等於國外市價，爲輸出點，國外銀價，加運費保險雜費等，等於國内市價，爲輸入點，現金銀轉移，全視輸出入點，與價目高下無關，）卽在上海售出匯票，而在國外售出期銀。卽可遏止銀之外軼。除非異常風潮，有此匯兌機關，就鎭得住。不必驚世駭俗，而收穩定匯市之功。國人何以多不注意到？別國所用管理調節國際滙兌政策，來操縱進出口貿易？那是程度太高了，我不敢抄來，做條陳貢獻。</p>
<p>我最奇怪的，國人遇到銀價大漲落時，倉皇失措，意見百出。過了時，又佯佯不睬，躲在那裹偷懶，連議論也沒有了。「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，」根本不是正經事。現在鬧紛紛的，不要閱若干時，銀價如其不漲，就寂靜大吉，若無其事。—二十三，三，六，晚</p>
<h3>中國煤業衰落的原因及其救濟：</h3>
<p>（一）中國煤的儲藏量及其產消</p>
<p>中國煤的儲藏量究有多少，至今還沒有正確的估計。據德拉格氏（Ｄａｒｋｅ）估計，爲九千九百六十六萬一千二百七十萬噸，據日人估計，爲一千二百九十九萬七千三百萬噸，據地質調查所一九二六年的估計，爲二千一百七十六萬二千六百萬噸，然其最近一九三二年的估計，則爲二百三十四萬三千五百萬噸，中國煤礦未經詳確調查，已盡人皆知，比如前年廣東福建兩省皆發見許多新煤礦，又如東三省及熱河，經日本帝國主義佔領後，比較詳細的調查，其儲量之估計又與前不同；故上述之數字，究竟誰爲可靠，恐沒有人敢下判斷吧！地質調查所一九三二年所公布的數字，介於數者之間，且爲較近之估計，似較可靠，因此我們在沒有得到比較正確的估計以前，只好暫時應用了。茲將其估計表列下：（單位百萬噸）</p>
<p>山西五、八三○　河南　一、七五五　安徽二○五　江西　　　八一五湖南一、六○○　山東　　　六八五　浙江一二○　湖北　　　一三○四川一、五○○　甘肅　一、○○○　福建一五○　綏遠　　　四六○雲南一、二○○　熱河　　　九三○　廣西五○○　黑龍江　　一六○貴州一、三○○　吉林　　　一六○　廣東三○○　瀋陽　　　九八五河北二、三七○　陜西　一、○○○　江蘇一九○　合計二三、四三五</p>
<p>從上表看來，可見中國煤的儲藏量，僅次於美國及加拿大，而爲世界第三位。有英德兩國兩倍之多，日本三十餘倍之多。然若衡諸中國人口，則實際並不爲多。現時中國煤的消費量很低，平均每人年用約○·○四噸（合中秤六十四斤）。若照歐美人每人的年用量六噸計算，則中國儲藏的煤，在十五年中當可用盡。中國產煤之區距工業中心很遠，最富之煤礦在山西省，其次則在湖南，四川，雲南，貴州，甘肅，陜西等省。</p>
<p>中國年來煤的消費額，現在尙沒有正確的統計，這是因爲各省土窯的產額無從知道。然以最近三年各省產煤能統計者，除出口數量和加入進口數量，約如下表：（單位噸）</p>

<p>從上面二表看來，可見中國近年來煤的產額增加甚微，其產額最大者爲幾個大煤礦公司。這幾個大煤礦公司，第一個就是日本南滿鐵道會社所經營的撫順煤礦，其次就是名爲中英合辦而主權操在英人之手的開灤礦務局，第三就是名爲中英合辦而實係英人獨裁的福公司。因此造成外人所經營的煤礦，估全國新式方法。開採的煤生產總額百分之八十以上，卽日人所經營的煤礦生產佔百分之三十五，英人所經營的煤礦生產佔百分之三十，俄德合佔百分之二十。</p>
<p>（二）中國煤業衰落的原因</p>
<p>上面我們已將中國煤的儲藏量，生產量，消費量約略述說了。現在就進而研究中國煤業衰落的原因吧！</p>
<p>本來在未述及中國煤業衰落的原因之先，還應該提出一些資料來證明其是否衰落，以及其衰落究竟到了甚麼程度，但因爲本刊篇幅有限，和中國煤業衰落已成爲儼然的事實，凡稍關心社會經濟的人誰都知道，故不論述，而直接研究煤業衰落的原因。</p>
<p>關於中國煤業衰落的原因，據我個人觀察所得，其大者大約有下面諸點：</p>
<p>（一）資本薄弱規模狹小技術落後　現時投資於煤礦業的中國資本，雖沒有統計，但從年來各煤礦公司　因缺乏資本周轉不靈而歇業縮小工作者比比皆是，便可看出。中國資本投資於煤礦者旣少，而又分割得很細，成爲各個小企業散在各省，不如外人公司之集中，所以全國華人公司雖有數十所之多；但生產反在外人公司之下。資本薄弱和企業規模狹小與技術也是有相當關係的；因爲不能隨意應用較新式的較進步的較好的機器，只圖維持現狀不求改良，所以自前清光緒四年應用新法開採至今四十餘年，而其技術還很落後。因此致煤生產的成本非常之重。如江西萍鄉鄱樂等礦每噸爲六元三角至六元五角，浙江長興煤礦爲五元，安徽大通公司爲五元八角，河南六河溝爲三元六角，中原爲三元一角七分，山東寶華爲六元五角二分，魯大爲三元八角五分，就其最低者如河北各礦也爲二元二角五分至二元八角五分。這樣高度的成本費，再加上下述諸原因，那無怪其銷路日蹙而衰落了。</p>
<p>（二）日煤傾銷　從表面上看來，中國煤每年皆有出超，本不應受外煤輸入傾銷之壓迫；然實際因中國煤的生產量，最大者係日本南滿鐵道會社所經營之撫順炭坑。而華人所經營之煤礦，又因捐稅繁重，運輸不便，運費昂貴，成本太貴，致給日煤（包含日本本國煤及撫順煤）以傾銷之機會。就使不貶價傾銷，國煤也難與之競爭，何况還大舉貶價呢！茲將近年日煤貶價在上海傾銷的情形，和國煤由產地運至上海的成本費列表於下以資參考。</p>
<p>（一）日煤在上海貶價傾銷的情形</p>

<p>大谷屑煤　八·○○兩　·○六兩　一·三五兩　·五○兩　一·○八兩　三·五三兩　二·四七兩　六·八○元</p>
<p>池野屑煤　五·八○兩　·○六兩　一·三五兩　·五○兩　一·○八兩　三·五三兩　二·二七兩　四·一五元</p>

<p>松浦屑煤　五·七五兩　·○六兩　一·三五兩　·五○兩　一·○八兩　三·五三兩　二·七二兩　四·一五元</p>
<p>（二）中國煤由產地運至上海的成本費（每噸）</p>
<p>產地至上海　平綏路運費　　北寗路運費　　輪船費　　　礦山成本　　　平漢路　　　雜費　　　共計</p>
<p>（至塘沽）　（至上海）　　　　　　　　　運費</p>
<p>大同煤　　　五·四○五元　一·五七二元　五·一○元　二·六○元　—　　　　　一·○○元　一五·六七七元</p>
<p>井陘煤　　　正太路運費　　一·五七二元　五·一○元　二·二五元　至塘沽　　　一·五○元　一二·六三○元</p>

<p>一·七○○元　　二·二六元</p>
<p>然日煤不僅在上海貶價傾銷，就其他各地也無不如此。據報載中日煤價格在漢口，青島·天津之比較如下：（單位噸）</p>
<p>販賣地　漢　　　口　青　　島　　　天津中　煤　十三元五角　十　元　餘　　十元　　　（濟漢公司）（山東博山煤）　以上日煤　十元左右　　　八元至九元　　十元</p>
<p>從上面諸表看來，可見中國煤在國内諸主要市塲，受日煤傾銷壓迫之一斑了。</p>
<p>（三）捐稅繁重　「國煤所負担之稅則槪分四類如下：（甲）礦區稅：中興煤每公畝已採者五分，未採者一分；大通煤五分；華東煤於開採五年以内爲二分，五年以外五分，採礦煤稅一分；六河溝煤五分；中原煤五分；華寶煤五分；保晋煤五分；長城煤二分五厘；寶興煤三角。（乙）產銷稅：中興煤每噸按市價抽百分之五；大通煤四角五分；華東煤按市價抽百分之五；六河溝煤二角；井陘煤三角；中原煤二角五分；華寶煤五角；惠元煤一角七分五厘；天興煤一錢；長城煤塊煤三角，末煤一角五爭；寶興煤一角七分五厘。（丙）海關稅：中興煤每噸銀一錢五分；大通煤二角三分；華東煤銀一錢二爭；六河溝煤二角五分；井陘煤銀一錢五分；保晋煤二角七分；長城煤塊煤銀一錢五分，末煤七厘五毫。（丁）雜稅：大通煤地方教育捐每年一千五百元；井陘煤警察捐每季洋五百元，保衛捐每季洋一百五十元，公安局煤車捐每月八百二十五元，公安捐每月一百元；華寶煤政府輔助捐每噸洋三角，保晋煤每噸約六角二分八厘八毫；天興牙稅每噸一分；長城煤公益捐每噸塊煤七分，末煤四分。」（見去年十二月十日上海新聞報）這一記載雖不能把所有煤礦全部捐稅包括無餘；但從此也就可以窺見捐稅繁重之一斑了。</p>
<p>（四）運費太昂　中國煤運費太昂，從上面中國煤由產地運至上海的成本費一表中，已可約略看出。在鐵道部業務司爲此問題，去年十月九日曾經致函上海申報聲明並不過昂（因申報十月四日「日煤與國煤」一時評言及國煤費過昂），謂：「……至於運價，則本部向來對於國煤，力持維護政策，鐵路貨祇分六等，煤斤一項，列入最低之等，原與泥沙土石同等最低之費；然在實際上各路煤運運價，雖因運輸情形及成本關係，所收多少不同；然產煤各路，大都訂有特價，或給予折扣，往往取價極廉，已在泥土沙石運價之下，遠不及運輸成本，何嘗一律列入六等。近來外煤傾銷，本部又特予維持。除各路煤運加價一律迭次繼續停加外，平漢湘鄂膠濟平綏等路或予特减，或予折扣，例如平漢路由六河溝運煤至漢口，現行之三十二欵，每噸僅收五元九角有奇，近日特價僅收五元三角，……若按照該路六等貨物計算，則應收費十七元零七分，現行運價僅及六等百分之三十五，而特價尙不及六等三分之一。……近來金價飛漲，人工物料增加倍蓰，營業費遠非二十年前可比，然各路運煤運價，不但未增反而低减……」（見去年十月十二日上海申報）雖然如此，但實際因中國各煤礦多居腹地，交通及轉運極度不便，故煤的運費仍是太昂，而成爲煤業衰落的主要原因之一了。</p>
<p>此外，如連年天災人禍繼續不斷，農村經濟破產，一般工業不振，致用煤减少，及東北四省被佔，該處之煤成爲傾銷中國本部之物等，皆莫不是現時中國煤業衰落之原因。</p>
<p>（三）中國煤業衰落的救濟策</p>
<p>救濟中國煤業衰落之方策，依我個人所見，大約有下面諸點：</p>
<p>（一）减輕採煤成本　關於採煤的成本費，上面已經說過，最低者二元二角五分，最高者實爲六元二角五分，比之日煤何止高出一倍，就使鐵路免費運輸，也難操競銷之權；故治本辦法，非設法减低採煤成本不可。减低成本，應籌集鉅資，添購新式採煤機器，擴大生產，改良技術，應用科學管理方法，監督生產。</p>
<p>（二）徵收外煤傾銷稅　歷年進口外煤，以日煤爲大宗，若連撫順煤合計，每年約在二百萬噸以上。現時的關稅，雖比以前頗高；但因日金跌價，故仍不足以阻止其輸入傾銷。因此，政府應卽時實行外煤傾銷稅，加重其售價，使國煤可以與之競爭。</p>
<p>（三）减免一切捐稅　中國煤礦公司負擔捐稅之重，已如上面所說，故欲使現時衰落之煤業復興，中央以及地方政府，應實行减低捐稅，觸免一切雜稅，使煤礦公司負擔减輕。</p>
<p>（四）减低鐵路運費添購運煤車輛　現時的鐵路煤運費，不僅相對的過昂，就運煤車輛也很缺乏，如前年因九一八事變抵制日煤，而長江一帶發生煤荒者，並非中國缺少煤斤，實因運煤之車輛缺乏，華北及各鐵路沿綫諸礦之煤斤不能運至長江各埠所致。後經實業部召開國煤救濟會，與鐵道部磋商合作辦法，多撥車輛五十列，由鐵道部直接指揮，專備各路運煤之用；於是問題才得相當解决。故政府爲救濟目前衰落的中國煤業起見，應一面再度减低鐵路煤的運費，一面添購車輛，分配給各路爲運煤之用。</p>
<p>（五）組織煤業產銷全作公司　產銷合作公司，若在資本主義發達的國家，是爲壟斷市塲和市塲價格之組織；可是在產業落後的國家則實爲抵禦外貨侵略，發展自國產業之組織。因爲此組織可以免除同業競爭，運貨往遠道兜銷等等無謂用費。譬如漢口市塲所需之煤，可以由漢口附近之煤礦供給，無須由河北山東等處之煤礦運往兜銷。贏餘虧捐，則由大家分配負擔。當此日煤輸入傾銷，中國煤業衰落之時，我以爲組織全國煤業產銷合作公司，分產合銷，是最良的救濟方策之一。</p>
<p>上面所提出的救濟方策，雖不是甚麼驚人之見；但我以爲如果能够一一實行，必能得到相當結果無疑。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>哀鴻遍野</h3>
<p>— 憲</p>
<p>不知道是國家命運的注定呢，或者還是由於人事的乖舛，近年來我們這神州赤縣的貴國，外部老是感受政治與經濟的侵凌，内部總遭逢不斷的戰亂與災早，所謂「天災人禍」，眞也應受盡受。我們這闖雜於都市裹的人，除了朝夕掙扎於生活的鞭子之下，時感飢餓的威脅外，總無法一覩這滿漫火藥氣之浩浩中原的實際情况；至於陶醉在這都會懷抱裹，入則水汀電扇，出則「奧斯汀」「白克」的貴人大亨，僅不過在茶餘飯後將此報紙上「動亂」的消息當作閒談的話題，認作「海外奇談」通訊記者加醬和醋過分的描寫而已。</p>
<p>眞的，農村經濟破產，災情嚴重，難民幾多，這些紀載雖佈滿了報章雜誌，但是他們究竟怎樣過活，與乎，在我們四萬人民中佔怎樣的數目，都不免有些隔閡。據最近賬災委員會的發表，在長江南北十四省的災民已有六千五百萬，深感「數量之鉅」，「殊堪驚人」，我覺這一消息，對於中國的「天災人禍」，到確乎描繪出一幅具體的輪廓。</p>
<p>這個數目非以全國計算，卽内部十八省亦未全部統計，因之如以整個國家來說，其數量之龐大當更驚人。目前就以中國人口四萬萬來說罷，除去東三省三千多萬，西北新蒙藏青及察綏寗夏各地假定爲一千萬，熱河及内部十八省的三省外，這個統計的十四省人口當在三萬萬左右。以災民六千五百萬的數目來與三萬萬相對較，卽這十四省中，五人或四人中已有一人成爲災民，這就是說每四五人中，便有一人已經呻吟於飢寒中，將快達到不能保存其生命。</p>
<p>這些將被剝奪生存資格的人們，除了一部份認清自己的環境與前途而積極奮鬥及隨命運擺佈而死亡外，有部份便滾入「打家刦舍」的浪濤，流入公開强奪與秘密打刦的道途。而這一浪濤的澎湃，更造成無數的飢餓之羣，增加新的「人禍」。至於連年不絕的「天災」，就有大部份是公利設施受「人禍」破壞的結果。我們一想到這六七千萬的災民，捱飢受凍，喝粥吃草根樹皮觀音土以至於賣妻鬻子異子而食的慘狀，眞不知應當搔首問天，還是躲地怨人！</p>
<h3>希望仍是希望</h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>買了航空獎票，誰都是抱着一個大的希望，最大的希望是五十萬塊洋，最小的希望也有兩塊錢，但，一個數目字都不中的話，那麼希望仍舊是希望。無論如何都是一個希望。</p>
<p>這個月二號那一天，不知道多少人還在拚却的買航空獎票，他們想只要化一塊錢，一到了下午兩點鐘就可以發財了，誰不願意呢？勇敢！化一塊錢吧！每一個人的心裹都是這樣的想，站在櫃面的人拿着一張一張的紙票向裹面說着：「啊，財票一張，兩張，又一張，賣得好起頸。</p>
<p>甲乙兩朋友買了二十張，他們在馬路邊走着，甲說：「喂，朋友！現在幾點鐘了？」乙說：「快了，不要急！還有兩分鐘，」他們很高興的跨着大步，走上沒有多遠忽然聽見大公司的播音機響了……頭獎第三……甲說：呀，不好了！乙說：靜聽末了一個字吧！</p>
<p>「頭獎第三二四五○四」播音機播出最後的數目字，甲乙兩人的視綫互相接觸，很失望，沒有什麼好說，甲很慷慨的把自己的票子送給乙，乙也把自己的票子送給甲，他們想還是化一塊錢去上茶館的好，於是走進新雅，再從新雅走下來的時候已經是四點多鐘了。</p>
<p>新夜報……看航空頭獎……新夜報……</p>
<p>頭獎二獎三獎都有啦，新夜報……馬路上的買報小童，喊得很吃力，從這邊馬路跑到那邊馬路，我們更可以看見每一個人手裹都拿着一張新夜報，掀開來要看的，不約而同，大家都是拚命的重復的念着那些數目，甲乙買了報紙跳上電車，乙說：喂，若是我們買中了，現在也不用坐電車了，不過，四月二十七，時間只有一個半月，我們還可以希望，甲說：我們所中的就是希望，我從第一期買到現在，化錢亦不少了，這回又要希望第五期，我看希望仍是希望，文永不會變成五十萬吧？</p>
<h3>分飛</h3>
<p>— 逸鷺</p>
<p>卜先生和卜師母倆間的感情終於現了極深的裂痕，再也沒有融合的餘地了。</p>
<p>在卜先生心裹，他覺得這是生平的遺憾：不該輕易地濫用愛情，以致今天心靈上受了這難堪的打擊。但在卜師母一方面，她未始不知今天自己過於忍心了，也未始不知「離婚」（？）是最痛苦的一幕人生悲劇。但她知道要追求實現的人生，痛苦總得要嘗嘗的，並且，這種痛苦是很有意義，很有價值的。她更知道自己年紀還很輕，她要利用她的青春，去換取充實的生命。</p>
<p>終於他們倆的心是越離越遠，不能再像從前的在一塊兒跳蕩着感應着了。</p>
<p>「我早就知道當女招待的女人總是下賤的，我却明知故犯，眞該自己打自已的嘴巴子。」卜先生恨恨地歎了口氣。</p>
<p>「我做了什麼不要臉的事？你說我下賤。」卜師母本來坐在靠方桌旁的椅子上，眼睛呆呆地望着窗外，現在，突然地立了起來臉朝着卜先生。</p>
<p>「你昨天不該向那姓王的釘住了望，你不該和他說話，你不該……」</p>
<p>「你這多疑的猴子！你能干涉我的</p>
<p>自由，憑什麼？」</p>
<p>「自由，哼！婦人家總得安分守已，你呢？不守婦道的賤貨！賤貨！」卜先生的火氣又提了上來。</p>
<p>「虧你好意思說出來，你能算是個男人嗎？昨天的米，還是我去問阿姊借了幾個錢才能　的呢。要吃要穿才嫁人，不要吃不要穿嫁什麼人？你這豬！」卜師母氣極了，把私陰都說了出來。</p>
<p>卜先生認爲這是莫大的羞辱，臉上頓時變得鐵青，走上前去，拍的一聲，就給卜師母一個巴掌，再也不說什麼。於是一切都擾動起來，椅子踢倒了，桌子撞翻了，接着一陣碗盞落到地上的雜亂聲。</p>
<p>這裹卜師母似乎因爲終究是個女子，漸漸地有點不支，終於「救命！救命！」的聲音從她的嘴裹擠了出來。跟着一陣樓梯的脚步聲，全屋的人都驚動了。</p>
<p>爲首第一個是二房東太太劉師母，她是位中年婦人，搬着個肥胖的身體推進房門。她是個最熱心的人，所以跑了第一，也第一個開口說話：「好好地怎麼打了起來？」這時，卜先生覺得面子上不大好看，先從地上爬了起來。同時卜師母知道有人上來，一股勇氣又復活了，爬了起來走到卜先生面前，一把揪住了他的領，說着：「你打，你打，」頭又撞了過去。</p>
<p>經着許多人的勸拉，這兩個身體才半推半就地分開去。</p>
<p>「有話好說，何必動武。氣平了，回頭又要後悔。總是自家人，做舍？」又是二房東太太劉師母第一個說話，很輕鬆的話。</p>
<p>「我不能過這種日子……」卜師母終於伏在牀上哭了。</p>
<p>「你要走，儘管滾！」卜先生氣得發抖。</p>
<p>「好，滾就滾，你給句話我。」</p>
<p>「何必如此？大家都忍耐些，不就大事化小事，小事化無事了嗎？况且，想想從前的一番情義，也就要不忍心的。……現在外面的人心又多麼壞！」劉師母倒底在人生道上有着相當的經歷，尤其在男女的關係上。</p>
<p>「劉師母的語眞不錯，是啊，人心太壞！」住在前房的楊師母和着說了。</p>
<p>「你們不知道，這種生活我也過够了，不能再過下去了，我非同他離婚（？）不可。」卜師母的意思非常堅决。同時她憧憬着的實現的人生，好像立刻在腦海裹閃映着。</p>
<p>第二天，在報紙上發現了一條很小的ＸＸＸ與ＸＸＸ協議脫離同居關係的啓事。</p>
<h3>我底煩惱</h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>在陰沉沉的天空中，聽見了一片瞭亮的聲間：「家家紅燈，家家紅燈。」「不如歸去，不如歸去。」更加上了車站裹轉過來的嗚嗚的汽笛聲。人家在打着鼾聲，表示他們正在甜蜜的睡鄉裹，我睜着雙眼，望着天空的一角，看見它由烏黑而變成灰白，由灰白而發出黎明時的光輝。大地上，校園裹，寢室中，還是死一般的靜寂，惟有鼾聲點綴着我的週遭。　　實在不想起來，四肢又是這樣的酸軟，昨天忙了一個整日，爲着入校的事。晚上又回嚼着別離的苦味，使我整夜不能入夢。</p>
<p>我別了故鄉，離了堂上父母，負篋來到了這罪惡的，繁華的上海。爲的是求學，爲的是欲解决以後自己和父母的生活吧，但是我懷疑，萬分地懷疑着，念了書是否果眞能解决得了將來的生活？暑假裹要畢業了，畢業是怎樣值得慶喜的一回事啊，可是在現實的社會裹，畢了業，卽是失業的開始，因爲正在鬧着失業恐慌中的現在，社會上是否能安然地安插了我們四五十個的同時畢業生呢？啊！可喜的畢業，可怕的畢業啊！</p>
<p>天大亮了，起來上課，上完了上午又繼續而上下午的，再上夜課。整整地差不多在教室裹挨過了整天的光陰。又是一天的過去了。天色仍歸烏黑。從上夜課的教室裹帶着疼痛的頭腦走出來，走回臥室去睡覺去。上有明月當空，伴着這孤獨的人一同經過了籃球場，再穿過校園的小亭。「啊！我好像是從販賣部裹回來，接受了教師們所販來的貨物。（教師是販賣部裹的掌櫃，學生是他們的顧主。）所開的留聲機的唱片，不知換過了幾多，有的是「三角」的、「物</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>理，」「大代數」的，「立體幾何」的，「</p>
<p>國文」的，「英文」的……怪不得我的身體是這樣沉重，而頭腦是這樣悶脹。原來我又裝進了這麼的許多！……」</p>
<p>同房間的同學又比我先睡了，房間裹以前所有的活躍着的空氣，又變成萬分的恬靜。我望着空中的明月，欵思着我的熱烈地期待着我的老父老母。「啊！他們的熱望我能否給他們如願以償呢？」這，我是太沒有把握子。……</p>
<h3>拜墓　黛妮：</h3>
<p>早上，陰沉沉的天，沒有風。我拖着沉重的脚步，跟在清道夫背後，盲子似的走。走完了一條長長的路，轉入了另一條。</p>
<p>我兩眼注視着地，望見了自己移向前去的兩個脚尖，似乎兩隻憂鬰的眼睛，從認識到現在，憂鬰姑娘的。</p>
<p>店舖洋房，樹頭，我已走那黃沙鋪着的路上。憂鬰的眼睛在前面閃耀，魔鬼樣的古廟矗起兩個屋角。</p>
<p>脚步似乎更慢了，憂鬰的眼睛更明顯地迷住了前面的去路，那個守廟的老人，他永遠掛着微笑，停了掃地的工作，「唔…唔」地招呼起來。</p>
<p>「冷啊？我隨意地說了，他跟着我」</p>
<p>進來。</p>
<p>一切都是破舊。麻雀在瓦隙里啁啾着，牠們或者覺得這里的雲氣太凄涼了。那老人雖是終年掛着微笑，但是不見得有可口的餘澤供給牠們；振起牠們的�</p>
<p>小翅膀飛到四野去—芟草叢生的荒塚，黃沙鋪着的小路，人嗎？那個已走過兩排橫屋拜訪他的另一個世界的友人：老人却機械地在橫屋内生起火來，一杯不十分高明的茶，可以換到他長年的糧食的。</p>
<p>我直向里面走去，脚步更慢了，幾乎像拖去似的，兩手插在袋里，埋緊了頭。走過了無數的石碑，好像無數對憂鬰的眼睛，直抵最後一個，我在草地上坐了下來。</p>
<p>兩手空空，沒有帶鮮花，沒有帶祭詞，帶來的是一顆憂鬰的心！</p>
<p>望着天空，陰沉沉的·沒有風。石碑上一對憂鬰的眼睛注視着我，像我們初見面時一樣；她迅速地一暼之後，注視到自己兩個脚尖上去了。</p>
<p>「你吐紅？」她似乎對我說。</p>
<p>我點點頭。</p>
<p>「我爸爸說最好要休養……」憂鬰的眼睛從我面前掃過。</p>
<p>「多也是這樣想……」</p>
<p>「我們下禮拜要到杭州去了。」她注視着自己的脚尖。</p>
<p>「可是我不能離開工作。」</p>
<p>我眼前的景物似乎模糊起來，不見那個石碑，不見憂鬰的眼睛，抬起頭來望天空，一片模糊的白雲，這是另一個世界嗎？我懷疑着。</p>
<p>盡力一掙，什滬東西像從眼睛内逃去，那個永遠掛着微笑的老人已站立在我面前，「先生，到里面去用一杯茶嗎？」</p>
<p>我習慣地暼了那石碑最後的一眼，注視着自己的脚尖跟老人走了。</p>
<p>在昏黯的橫屋里坐地，沒有說話。我喝了一口茶，掏出一塊錢來賞了那老人，他感激地掛着微笑，灣着腰送我出門。</p>
<p>天空陰沉沉的，沒有風，我注視着自己的脚尖，踏着黃沙鋪着的小路走回家去。</p>

<h3>露露的勝利（八）</h3>
<p>— 義大利Ｍ．賽拉歐著景心譯</p>
<p>「啊，好吧！」露露聳着她的肩變了一個話題說道：「今天晚上你眞地不和我們一道兒來麼？」</p>
<p>「不，我頭痛，你可以同着媽媽去。」</p>
<p>「有什麼關係，我照樣可以青的，因爲我可以有一個很快活的時候。」</p>
<p>「那……那羅勃特也和你一道兒去麼？」</p>
<p>「不；他到俱樂部裹去，那兒要開幹事會議。我利用這個時候去赴戴麗諾的舞會，而且一直跳到天亮。」</p>
<p>「可是他若曉得這事呢？」</p>
<p>「那就更好。從此他可以學習着讓我自己自由；我不願意他有那種不好的習慣。」</p>
<p>「由我看來，你是不大愛他的。」</p>
<p>「我愛他愛得很厲害，不過我有我的方式，現在我必要穿衣服去了，這至少也費我兩個鐘頭。」</p>
<p>蘇菲亞站在那里靜聽着那載着她的母親和妹妹走去的馬車的驟音。她孤獨地留着，非常地孤獨，她平素總是願意獨自一個人的。像一個小孩子似地，若受了人的欺辱，她是獨自哭泣的，當她在床上或是在黑暗中，她也有這種習慣。現在她一個人停在這間大客室裹，在那輝煌的燈下，她的手呆然地放着，她的頭靠着椅背，她的面孔露出了非常憂傷的表情，這可以使我們清楚地理解在她的内心裹是有着激烈的抵觸。的確的，在這種完全孤獨的時候，一種非常痛苦的意識支配了她；許久不敢審視的現實的情感，現在變成清晰而忍殘了。</p>
<p>脚步的聲音使她吃了一驚。來人是羅勃特。看見她獨自一個人，他停住了猶豫着；但是他以爲別的人們也許是正在旁的屋裹，他就前進了。蘇菲亞立剿點起○來了；激動的樣子。</p>
<p>「晚安哪，蘇菲亞。」</p>

<h3>導演編劇的兼任問題</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>中國的電影事業現在已經在逐漸地進步中，許多從業員都在盡力地望前幹着。這是我們可以見到的事實。但若我們細心的觀察，我們可以找出這在進行的電影界中，還缺乏充份合作精神的表現。</p>
<p>電影是綜合的藝術。一部完美的影片的構成，必須得到資本家和從業員的充分合作。而從業員之中，有管理總務的導演，編劇的文學家，以及美術家，攝影師，剪接家……等。必須大家都能够勝任，而且都能够携手合作，方才能够有好影片的產生。</p>
<p>在諸般合作之中，導演和編劇的分工合作是一部影片成敗的關鍵。在歐美諸國，編劇本是一種專門的職業。多數的影片劇本是有專家寫成，然後交給導演人去處理。雖然也有不少劇本是由導演人寫成，但這種兼職只能算是例外。因爲編劇本是一種費時而繁重的工作，難免使導演人顧此失彼，延誤了製片的工作進行呢。</p>
<p>大導演家如劉別謙，西席地密爾，金維多等，他們都有他們所喜歡和熟練的編劇人。他們在指定要拍攝某片時，他們便把那項題材交給編劇人去處理。導演人除了把自己的一些意見告訴編劇人之後，以後一切都讓編劇人施用技巧的手段去寫成它。使導演人可以按圖索驥，在構成的想象上錦上添花，加以修正配排，便可以開始攝製了。有時導演人認爲工作繁重時，編劇人曾用二人共同去擔任。</p>
<p>在我們中國的電影界，至今還是因陋就簡，自然不能事事比擬於歐美。但是至於每部影片的劇本都要勞導演先生來兼任編寫。這確不是影界前途之幸。有人說中國的導演先生都有編劇的天才，我倒要說是中國的編劇家都會導演呢。</p>
<p>劇本編寫的工作之繁忙，以及導演工作的殫費心力，這兩者顯然都需要專門人才的處理，和需要一人以上的心靈上的融通和精密的考慮。證之一般國片成績的欠完美，甚至缺乏常識和不合情理的事物時常映現在銀幕之上，足見單靠一位導演人的才力是多麼冒險。而且有許多有好戲做的關鍵也都平淡地過去，這都足見導演人臨塲時之手忙脚亂，原先就缺欠一位良好的編劇家的精密合作，使影片產出後患了貧血症，使好好的軟片變成硬性了。</p>
<p>中國的良好的編劇家在那裹呢？固然還是一個疑問。然而就近今的事實看來，我們的製片家並不重視劇本的重要性倒是實事。結果只强迫導演人交卷出來。無怪一般國片題材的枯燥牽強，比起歐美影片的日新月異，眞是不可以道里計了—</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>從「愛斯基摩」談到帝國主義</h3>
<p>— 瘦字</p>
<p>「愛斯基摩」是目前單以香艷肉感繁華熱鬧見長的美國片子中不可多得的一個名片。他的偉大，本報已有介紹，不過我還有一點意見。</p>
<p>假使說，這片是暴露帝國主義罪惡的話，則我們應該嚴格批評他的暴露並不充分，而且很不正確。帝國主義的罪惡，是整個種族階級的，而這裹却只有一個船主担當了一切的罪名，其他船夥，警察，都似乎是人道主義的。這樣，容易使觀衆錯誤的意識到這片所暴露的，不是整個資本階級的罪惡，而祇是船主一個人的罪惡。對象未免不正確。這是一。其次，反帝也應該是整個被壓迫階級的，而這片所描寫的，祇是一個人英雄主義的鬥爭。結果爲什麼馬拉一個人帶着妻子而飄流不知所終呢？應該是整個愛斯基摩民族起來共同奮鬥。任是大家戰死也好。這是二。這點，本報前次批評中也已約略說到了，不過講得很不清楚，所以我這裹鄭重補充幾句。自然，我不能過於吹毛求疵，但旣已指出這片内容爲反帝，則我們就不得不稍爲指出其錯誤之點了。因爲這種錯誤的表演，很易使觀衆陷於不正確的印象，應該告訴他們的。</p>
<p>本來，這是張資本主義國家的產物，因此，它大胆地敢於暴露白種人中一部份的罪惡，已經是差强人意的了。</p>
<h3>評「中國海的怒潮」</h3>
<p>— 克洛</p>
<p>這部片子雖然受了客觀環境的限制，有許多地方失去了本來面目：然而牠仍然有充分的力量，足以把握住觀衆的情緒；尤其是最後漁民忍無可忍，一致起來與外國漁船火併時。</p>
<p>由這部影片中，我們可以看到漁民在高利貨，劣紳，以及帝國主義者幾層壓迫下，是怎樣艱難困苦的生活着。</p>
<p>導演在此片中施展了他絕頂的聰明，開始以盤中的魚肉來象徵漁民的生命，也可以說是象徵着整個中國民族的生命。後來又以擊死偷米吃的老鼠，來表明漁民對於壓迫者的憤恨，給觀衆以有力的暗示，其餘如阿德在沙灘上跑在阿福屍旁，那悲痛的面部的特寫，再用陰鬰的天空來陪襯一下，更有力的激動了觀衆的心絃。這都是導演聰明過人的地方。</p>
<p>演員都很成功，焦大（秦桐飾）之敦厚，樸實；阿福（查瑞龍飾），阿德（王引飾）之掘强，沉着；小榮妻（雷夢娜飾）之殘忽，潑辣，每個人的個性都被充分的表現出來了；尤其是飾阿菊之袁美雲，將在張家爲婢時的小心謹愼，及海濱漂泊時的天眞活潑，表演得維妙維肖，很值得令人讚美的！</p>
<h3>却爾斯法雷重與珍妮合作</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>這是個很可喜的消息，就是「七重天」的老搭擋，却爾斯法雷和珍妮蓋諾，重新合作了。却爾斯所以要和珍妮分手的原因，外間傳說不一，恐怕祇有他們兩個人自己知道。但是大家都說最大的一個原因，是因爲珍妮的名氣太大了，掩蓋了他的聲名。現在他自從和狐貍公司解約之後，卽在各公司「散做」（Ｆｒｅｏ－ｌａｎｃｉｎｇ），已經建樹了一個獨立的名聲，因此一般觀衆，都請求他和珍妮蓋諾重新合作。却爾斯法雷於是就答應了觀衆的請求。他非但答應了觀衆的請求，並且已經和狐貍公司重訂了合用，和珍妮蓋諾合演一張“Ｔｈｅ　Ｓｕｎ　ＳｈｉｎｅｓＢｒｉｇｈｔ）。於是這兩位銀幕上的皇帝皇后，又在並坐着朝見羣臣了。同時狐貍公司還有兩個老搭擋重新合作，那就是詹姆斯東（Ｊｐｍｅｓ　Ｄｕｎｎ）和莎麗愛鸞（Ｓａｌｌｙ　Ｅｉｌｅｒｓ）的復合。有人說：這都是影界復興的一種新氣象云。</p>
<h3>希佛萊新片「風流寡婦」開始拍攝　西復：</h3>
<p>希佛萊自和琴妮麥唐娜分手之後，很久很久沒有演新片子了，可是現在已經决定了攝製一張新歌舞片，呌做「風流寡婦」（Ｔｈｅ　Ｍｅｒｒｙ　Ｗｉｄｏｗ），並且他已經决定了他的合演者爲瓊克勞馥。查這張「風流寡婦」本來是張一九二五年的老片子，那是由梅茂蘭（Ｍａｅ　Ｍｕｒｒａｙ）和約翰吉爾勃（Ｊｏｈｎ　Ｇｉｌｂｅｒｔ）主演，而係由馮史都漢（Ｅｒｉｃｈ　Ｖｏｎ　Ｓｔｒｏｈｅｉｍ）導演的一張名片。現在由米高梅公司將那片子的脚本，更動了一些，以適合希佛萊的作風。</p>
<p>現在的「風流寡婦」，係由劉別謙導演的。因於希佛萊和劉別謙的分而復合，大家就議論到他和他的老搭擋琴妮麥唐娜，到底有沒有再合作的可能。可是希佛萊已决定不願意和她合作了。理由係以往的影片的成功，希佛萊琴妮二人的功勞是相等的，但是當他們二人前年同遊歐洲的時候，巴黎全城對於琴妮非常傾倒，但對於希佛萊反覺得冷冷的。因此，希佛萊覺得琴妮專略了他的美，就此不願意和她合作了。米高梅公司曾向希佛萊舉薦過許多能唱歌的名女伶，去和他配演「風流寡婦」，但希佛萊因爲她們歌喉雖好，却不甚出名。因此他决意去請瓊克勞馥和他合演。瓊聽見了，亦就歡然應允了。</p>

<h3>華山豓史（一）</h3>
<p>— 心純</p>
<p>導演：程步高　主演：徐來·襲稼農·陳凝秋　出品：明星影片公司</p>
<p>一九二六年的夏天，故都的土城正在軟軟的薰風裹，做着它懷古的舊夢。空氣炎炎地呌人睡覺。</p>
<p>北平最高學府的試騐塲裹，正在忙碌着舉行學期考試。法科學生洪家辰，手裹拿着一本「憲法講義」和一張油印的試題，他剛從試騐塲出來，沉思地從走廊上走去。迎面來了文科學生余蘭，那嫵媚的女性。</p>
<p>「快得很，成績怎麼樣？未來的大律師洪先生！」女的嫣然一笑，那麼調侃似的說了。家辰也笑着回答：</p>
<p>「四個題目，吃了一個半鴨蛋，未來的文學家余小姐！」</p>
<p>靜默地笑着，彼此感到了一點闌姍，接着他們就談到了暑假中怎麼消遣的問題。</p>
<p>一個大學生，愛愛的功課大槪是不會忽略了的，余蘭就戀愛着一位文科的同學，被呌做長白山詩人的高個兒陳北峯。她說要和北峯商量去。—他們同到了北峰的寢室。</p>
<p>寢室裹靜靜的，窗中漏出了錚錚的琴聲。詩人北峯總是那麼愛彈琴的，音樂和詩就像是他的生命。可是同室的胖子同學尤廣昭，却老是在他的彈琴聲裹被催眠似的睡着覺。</p>
<p>余蘭和洪家辰兩個跑進了寢室，余蘭爲洪和北峯介紹了，洪便問：</p>
<p>「暑期的計劃怎樣？回東北去？」</p>
<p>北峯迂闊地搖着頭：詩情詩趣，都給都市的黃塵吹搜尋盡了，我打算趁暑期到華山絕頂去寫一點作品。」……</p>
<p>大家談着，門上起着剝啄的聲音，又進來了一位同學，北峯的同鄉黃振聲，一個魁偉的，帶着點兒英雄氣概的青年。他侷促地向在座各人招呼了一下，欲言又止地好一會，終於把北峯拉到了外面：</p>
<p>「北峰，我不再呼吸這種死一般的空氣，我已經决定今晚動身到黃埔去了。」</p>
<p>那麼嚴肅而又愴傷地說了，北峯祇感到黯然。兩個面面相覷地，被一種惆悵的情緒支配着。經過長久的靜默，熱烈地握了一回手，振聲才决然地走了。</p>
<p>各人的個性與意識决定了他們的生活：洪家辰打算趁暑假到上海去觀一次光：余蘭和北峯，自然到華山上寫詩彈琴講戀愛去。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　　　　Ｘ　　　　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>華山的風景是那麼瑰奇而且美麗的。余蘭和北峯，這一對美滿的情侶，在那詩情畫意的深山白雲之間，徜徉了若干時候，也就回到北平學校裹來。</p>
<p>觀光了東方第一大都會的上海回來的洪家辰，和探訪了華山的一天雲海回來的余蘭遇着了。余蘭是那麼矛盾，那麼動搖的女性，她一方面追求着幻想的詩似的精神生活，一方面却憧憬着近代文明的物質享受。洪家辰送了她許多上海帶回來的東西，也給她談了許多上海的繁華綺麗。余蘭的面上一陣陣地蕩漾着豓羨的神色。（未完）</p>

<p>Sun Dianying's Reply to Fu Shows Inability to Leave the Army</p>
<p>Fu Zhankui to Return to Ping for Orders, Major Battle Imminent</p>
<p>Jin-Sui Army Has Reached the Three Saints Palace, Wang and Zhao Depart to Supervise the Troops</p>
<h3>Sun Takes a Defensive Posture Against the Jin-Sui Army, Lu Fengnian Plans to Leave Sun's Command</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Fu Zhankui arrived at Dengkou, he sent a letter inviting Sun to meet in Dengkou. Sun replied, stating that before the post-battle arrangements for his troops were decided, he was unwilling to abandon his comrades who had shared hardships for many years, and asked for understanding. Seeing Sun's lack of sincerity, Fu left Dengkou within days to return to Ping to report. A peaceful resolution was hopeless. The Jin-Sui Army would soon launch an attack, and a major battle could begin within days. On the 6th, Sun convened a meeting of his generals at Yangjiazhai outside Pingluo City to discuss future actions. At the time, Yu Shiming, Lu Fengnian, and others advocated awaiting reorganization. Liu Yueting and others advocated that Sun not leave the army. Liu volunteered to lead troops to capture Ningxia. Sun then decided to remain in the army for the time being, taking a strictly defensive posture against the Jin-Sui Army in the area of Dengkou, Three Saints Palace, and Shizuizi. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying is currently near Pingluo, and his attitude remains unclear. Fu plans to go to Pingluo to meet with Sun and discuss everything in person, or may go to Ningyuan to meet with Ma Hongda. The Jin-Sui Army has received orders to move west immediately to attack Dengkou. The vanguard has reached the Three Saints Palace. Sun's Yu Shiming's troops are also moving in that direction and are rushing to build defensive works in an attempt to resist. The Jin-Sui Army's westward advance makes a major battle difficult to avoid. If Sun does not repent, military operations will proceed according to the original plan. All routes are now ready and will soon implement a total encirclement and general attack. Currently, some of Sun's cavalry, dissatisfied with Sun's actions, plan to leave. Sun is quite wary and closely monitors his cavalry. Sun, hearing that his troops are brewing a revolt, is very panicked. He recently telegraphed Lu Fengnian and others, urging them to cherish their years of shared hardships and not surrender to the National Army. Lu has replied by telegram, stating that each will go their own way. Sun is now transferring Liu Yueting and Wang Ying Yang Houxiao and other bandit troops to Dengkou to resist the Jin Army and monitor Lu Fengnian's troops. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Baotou telegram, Ningxia news: Sun's main force shows signs of gradually moving north, proving that he has no intention of repenting. The Jin-Sui authorities have made up their minds to severely suppress him. Fu's westward trip has been fruitless, and the time for a peaceful resolution has passed. The Jin-Sui Army has ordered a general attack on all routes to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou went to Linhe together this morning to supervise the suppression. Military operations should make great progress within a day or two. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news, Ningxia telegram: The situation in the Pingluo battle in Ningxia remains unchanged. The bandit cavalry of Yang Houxiao, who harassed southern Xia, was completely wiped out after we severely suppressed them on the 4th and 5th. A certain unit of a certain division will continue to advance from Zhongwei tomorrow. Here, we will cooperate with a certain unit to attack after the Jin-Sui Army advances to a corresponding location. Sun's cavalry units, Lu Cunyi and Li Chunhua, are in contact to surrender, and the possibility of success is high. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lu Fengnian previously sent Yu Muxing as a representative to Ping to meet He, expressing his intention to surrender. Lu recently telegraphed Ping, stating that Sun's attitude was strong and he refused to leave the army. He plans to issue a circular telegram within a short period of time to leave Sun's command, so that the war in the Northwest can end early to alleviate the suffering of the people. If the Jin-Sui Army attacks westward, Lu's troops will give up the defense from the Three Saints Palace to Dengkou to avoid conflict with the Jin-Sui Army. The authorities have responded to Lu's ability to consider the overall situation and abide by military orders and have sent a telegram of commendation. The method of resolving the matter is still under discussion. It is expected that Lu's troops' defection can be realized soon. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The vanguard of the Jin-Sui Army contacted Lu Fengnian's division at Yangjiahe and Huangyangmutou the day before yesterday, and the conflict lasted for about an hour. Lu's troops withdrew westward to give way. The Jin-Sui Army crossed Yangjiahe and is currently in a stalemate at Huangyangmutou. The military deployment in the five provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai has been largely completed, and a total encirclement and general attack will be implemented within days. A major battle is expected to be imminent. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou telegram: Yang Qutong's troops in eastern Gansu have been concentrated in the Qingyang area as the general reserve team for southern Ningxia to support the military operations in northern Shaanxi. The construction of fortifications in northern Shaanxi and eastern Gansu against Sun has been completed, and Yang is commanding at the front. A person from Dengkou said that Ningxia New City, that is, Shuoxian, is only twelve li away from the capital of Ningxia Province, located in the northwest of Ningxia, and is the gateway to the provincial capital. When I was in Dengkou, it was rumored in mid-last month that Sun's troops were already in the area. Sun's troops also dug trenches in the area and fiercely attacked the capital of Ningxia Province. The walls of Ningxia City are very large, and the defenses inside the city are well-maintained and there are many obstacles, so Sun's troops never succeeded. There have been no major battles on the Pingluo side so far. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying has not made a concrete statement on leaving the army. Without using force to restrain him, it cannot be resolved. Zhu Shaoliang flew from Ningxia to Beijing to transfer to Jiangxi to report to Chairman Jiang and request instructions. Now the Jin-Sui Army is concentrating in Linhe, and the armies of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are also advancing step by step. When the military pay and weapons are issued, they will advance at the same time. Sun's army feels difficulties in both supplies and military strength, and the morale of the army is also very dissipated. The National Army will surely win. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Muxing, representative of Lu Fengnian, said that he had visited He several times. Division Commander Lu has always opposed Sun's westward advance. His troops, the three brigades of Bao Lianjin, Xie Zhenguo, and Xie Putian, are still stationed between the Three Saints Palace of Dengkou. Lu himself is eager for a peaceful resolution so that the local people can be spared from suffering. The troops under his command are willing to be reorganized by the Central Government and break away from Sun. Before Fu and Sun meet, it is difficult to determine the method of reorganizing Sun's troops here. He will leave Ping in a day or two to go to Baotou to meet Chuan and discuss everything. After the public duties in Baotou are completed, he will return to Ping. He will not return until the method of dealing with Sun's troops is decided. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Baotou Zhao Chengshou and Wang Jingguo left Baotou for Linhe at 6:00 AM on the 11th, and then went to the front to supervise the troops. According to Zhao's talk to reporters, the vanguard cavalry of the Jin-Sui Army has concentrated on the east bank of the Wula River, facing Sun's army across the river. The river has not yet thawed, making it easy to travel. If Sun is still stubborn, the battle can start immediately. (11th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Baotou Sun's troops originally had 18 regiments, but the Jin-Sui Army dispatched a total of 20 regiments, which is enough to deal with Sun's army. (11th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Justice Orders Changes to Court Organization</h3>
<p>Local Courts Do Not Hear Second Instance Cases</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that the Court Organization Law, which adopts a three-level, three-instance system, will be implemented on a regular basis. It has specially ordered the high courts of each province to stipulate that second-instance litigation cases should be transferred to the High Court or the High Branch Court. Each region should consider adding High Branch Courts. All county courts, local courts, branch courts of local courts, and local offices in the provinces will be changed to local courts. In places where High Branch Courts are established, if there are no local courts originally, they must be added, and the two courts should be located in the same place. Local courts do not hear second-instance cases, and High Courts do not hear third-instance cases. They are ordered to draft detailed plans for expenses and staff quotas and submit them for approval.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Formulates Second Phase of Large-Scale Bandit Suppression Plan</h3>

<h3>Five Small Ports Near Gubeikou Have Been Received</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun telephone: After Gubeikou was taken over, in addition to our police guarding the gate of the Zozhi Bureau and the Commissioner's Office, Japanese soldiers still patrol the streets and have not withdrawn.

Shibata plans to take the opportunity to carry out this matter. The Luanping County Office of Rehe Province and the Rehe Transportation Anti-Smuggling Team houses in the downhill Gubeikou City have been occupied by our office, the Zozhi Bureau, and the Second and Third Sub-bureaus of Public Security for office purposes. After the puppet police at Nantianmen withdraw in the future, we plan to send police security teams to guard them. Recently, due to the disturbances caused by Japanese and Korean vagrants in Tangshan after the cessation of hostilities in eastern Luan, the Japanese have sent Japanese police to be stationed to maintain law and order. The Japanese Embassy in Gubeikou also plans to send police officers to assist us in suppressing them. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Nakamura, commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, was originally the commander of the Nishiyui First Division and was transferred to the commander of the Tokyo Garrison.

<p>Mutiny of the Puppet National Army, A Japanese Army Unit is Missing</p>
<h3>Heavy Casualties on Both Sides of the Battle on the Songhua River</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Harbin says that a mutiny occurred near Sanxing, 150 miles northwest of Harbin. Colonel Iizuka and more than ten senior officers are missing. The telegram is brief and the scope of the mutiny is unknown. It is suspected that Iizuka led troops to suppress "bandits" in the Songhua River, and it is likely that the local troops mutinied and attacked the Japanese army, resulting in the disappearance of Iizuka and others. Since the Japanese army occupied Shenyang on September 18, this kind of mutiny has occurred more than once. Official news about this incident has not yet been released. It is not yet known whether the Ministry of the Army has received a report on this matter, but there is much attention being paid to this incident, and we are awaiting further reports.

A reply is expected on the 12th, clarifying the attitude to be taken on this matter. As for Arakichi Chujiro, the Japanese who investigated the church, since a certain military attaché of the Japanese Embassy denied his existence and the incident, it is learned that he has not left Ping today, but has stopped his activities.

<p>(Beiping) Nishida Otsuo, the Japanese Chief of Police Guard in Chahar, came to Ping the other day for official matters and returned to Chahar this afternoon. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>National Government Issues Announcement on Northeast Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an announcement on the 11th, saying that since the September 18th Incident, the government has recognized the seriousness of its nature, which cannot be compared to ordinary international incidents, nor can it be dealt with by ordinary diplomatic methods. Therefore, in the diplomatic field, it has appealed to the League of Nations with the facts, and after several efforts, it finally obtained the resolution of March 11, 1932, to preserve territorial integrity and political independence, and the resolutions of February 24, 1933, and June 7 of the same year, not to recognize the puppet organization. The responsibility lies with the greatness, and the puppet organization, although deceptive, is ultimately excluded from the international community. As for the military aspect, although there was not enough strength to uphold justice and recover lost territory by force at that time, there was no turning back if there was an invasion. Therefore, in the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of Gubeikou, our army fought with modern new weapons with flesh and blood, and the casualties were piled up like mountains, but there was no discouragement. This is the real situation of past diplomacy and military affairs, and it is also the unchanging policy for the future. Recently, the puppet organization changed its name to the imperial system, and the people were indignant and urged to condemn it. However, the government has always recognized that these puppets have no independent personality and do not become the object of crusade. However, in view of their treasonous acts, they should be treated in the same category as those who endanger the Republic of China. Other villains, such as those who echo the puppet organization's conspiracies and disturbances, will be severely punished by the government in accordance with the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China and the Regulations on Punishing Bandits, and there will be no leniency. In short, the country is in danger, and the opportunity for survival is at stake. All Chinese people should draw on the meaning of the responsibility of every citizen, uphold the spirit of sincere unity, and make preparations for recuperation and training with the spirit of bearing humiliation and working hard, so as to reverse the national crisis and maintain a unified and complete country, and strive together.

He stated his difficulties, saying that the reasons why he resigned from the post of mayor were: 1. He was too weak to be competent. 2. It was difficult to handle affairs and difficult to resolve. 3. He was saddened by the daily deterioration of national affairs, so he wanted to let a virtuous person take over, which might reverse the misfortune. Moreover, two-thirds of his hometown of Yangxin County, Hubei Province, had been disturbed by communist bandits, and he was willing to return to his hometown to assist the magistrate of Yangxin County in managing county affairs.

<h3>Armed Preparation and Far Eastern Peace Shu</h3>
<p>Armed peace. It was an old saying from before the World War. Moreover, the stimulation of the military-industrial complex is known to all to be temporary in nature. However, all countries in the world today, whether it is the United States, dominated by the gold standard, France, the hegemon of Europe, England, focused on economic management, Japan, blindly advancing, or the Soviet Union, which is socialist, are all gathering their energies in the construction of armaments, preparing for any eventuality. Among these, the deepest crisis and the most intense conflict are not the enmity between Germany and France in Europe, nor the Franco-Italian rivalry for hegemony in Central Europe. Although Germany deeply resents the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and strives for equality in armaments, its economic strength is weak, and its military facilities are not yet sufficient. Moreover, Italy's alliance with Austria is only based on diplomacy as a basis for combat, and it is not truly determined to settle past facts through war, using force to satisfy its hopes. As for the Balkans, it is a temporarily calmed volcano. Although there are materials for explosion, it is still in the process of brewing, and it will take time to cause trouble.</p>
<p>In the current world, the danger of the outbreak of war is greater, and the situation is more urgent, and that is the various disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union. The trade of the Chinese Eastern Railway is not easy to complete, and Japan's attempt to use puppets to seize the railway is also difficult to stop immediately. In addition, there is the possibility of unexpected outbreaks along the Jilin-Heilongjiang border. Japan has concentrated its troops stationed in Manchuria in the Xing'an Mountains and Suifen River. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has deployed nearly 200,000 elite soldiers along the Ussuri Railway from Chita to Vladivostok. According to general observation, this kind of tense situation is difficult to maintain in a normal state for a long time. Moreover, Japanese junior officers stationed in Northeast China are eager to try their hand at the opportune moment. Many active and reserve soldiers are advocating for war. There are also complex relationships such as North Sea fisheries, which can easily lead to unexpected and serious consequences. Therefore, the saying of a Japanese-Soviet war has spread far and wide, and the crisis of a Far Eastern war is even more likely to attract attention. Moreover, since the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has suddenly turned its defensive diplomacy into an offensive one. Its offensive against Japan is particularly active. From Stalin to Garen, the commander of the Far East, they have often issued warnings targeting the Japanese army. Moreover, Japanese planes flying across the border have been bombed by the Soviet army. Isn't this kind of situation a harbinger of the eve of a major war?</p>
<p>However, we still cannot help but have some doubts. What we doubt is not the question of whether there will be war between Japan and the Soviet Union, but the question of the timing of the war. From a common observation, it seems that the urgency of war is imminent. In the near future, war will be unavoidable. Starting with the Japanese-Soviet war, the Second World War will be inevitable. However, based on an objective assessment of the situation of both sides, the Japanese-Soviet war is unlikely to break out in the short term. Why is this? From the Soviet Union's standpoint, its first five-year plan has just been completed, and the second five-year plan is about to begin. Although the foundation of the revolution is becoming more stable, the actual military preparations still need to be strengthened. Therefore, it strives for diplomatic harmony with the small countries of Western Europe. Among the capitalist countries, it seeks to please countries such as France, and signs non-aggression treaties. The application of trade is even more tactful in diplomacy. Even towards Japan, it does not hesitate to propose a non-aggression treaty. Based on this, the Soviet Union will never take military action against Japan. This is one reason. As for Japan, the reckless faction is indeed advocating for a war at this time, but scholars with some modern knowledge, as well as figures in the political world, are all deeply aware of Japan's difficult situation. The current state of its domestic economy does not allow it to truly challenge the outside world. It would be a great fortune if it could maintain Japan's current overseas market status and gradually develop. Moreover, the sharpness of its domestic contradictions, the result of the unbalanced economic development of rural and urban areas, has not only deteriorated ideology but also fundamentally shaken its political organism. Once a war occurs, although it can be guaranteed that there will be no great danger, even the senior leaders of the warlords have recently realized that it is unwise to deliberately provoke a challenge and have agreed to make slight concessions to the outside world. Japan's recent softening attitude towards the Soviet Union can be a clear proof. This is the second reason. Thirdly, the confrontation between Japan and the United States is still active. The situation in the Pacific is gradually becoming tense with the United States building more warships. However, this move by the United States is still mostly intended for strict defense, and there is little meaning of offense. Therefore, from a superficial observation, it seems that this will lead to a military conflict between Japan and the United States. In fact, it will only restrain the development of military struggles between Japan and the Soviet Union and delay the intensification of future wars. Therefore, although there are many bad materials accumulated at present, without more serious provocations, a war will not break out immediately. This is our observation on the issue of timing.</p>
<h3>Fire at the German Embassy</h3>

<h3>New Appointment Rumor for Lindbergh</h3>
<p>Rumored to be Appointed as Head of the American Aviation Department</p>
<p>(Washington) Although Captain Lindbergh has vehemently attacked President Roosevelt's aviation policy, it is rumored today that this world-renowned transatlantic aviator will soon be appointed as Undersecretary of Aviation. This news had been rumored last week. Since Captain Lindbergh had a long talk with Secretary of War Dern at the Secretary of War's residence and was invited to dinner by the Secretary of War and his wife, the matter has become more credible. Today, reporters visited the Secretary of War to inquire about the matter. The Secretary of War neither confirmed nor denied it, only saying, "I think I benefited a lot from talking with Captain Lindbergh. Mr. Lindbergh will surely be able to give us loyal advice." According to the Secretary of War, he only had ordinary talks about aviation issues and did not mention President Roosevelt's cancellation of private aviation on February 19 or the return of the aviation industry to private companies. Since the news that Captain Lindbergh may be appointed as Undersecretary of Aviation was released, informed sources have been surprised. Some believe that Mr. Lindbergh's criticism of the president has had little effect. Some believe that Mr. Lindbergh's original intention was only to seek public sympathy. Most newspapers have severely attacked Lindbergh's protest against the government, believing that since Mr. Lindbergh is a director of Pan American Airways, his remarks cannot be regarded as his personal opinion.

<h3>League of Nations Opium Committee</h3>
<p>Nearly Cast a Wrong Move by Recognizing the Puppet State</p>
<p>Fortunately Corrected in Time by the US State Department</p>
<p>No Country Shall Transport Narcotics to the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to the news announced here today, without the timely intervention of the US State Department, the League of Nations would have misinterpreted the 1912 Hague Opium Convention and made the erroneous move of de facto recognizing the government of "Manchukuo." The matter was discovered by Mr. Frollo, the head of the Opium Section. Thanks to Mr. Frollo's reminder, the League of Nations was able to avoid committing a double error, both social and political. When the League of Nations Advisory Committee suggested a draft that did not recognize "Manchukuo" de facto or de jure, it mistakenly included "Manchukuo" in the committee's recommendation on opium, allowing governments to issue passports for opium transported to "Manchukuo" and stipulating that such passports must not conflict with the 1925 Opium Convention. Regarding this point, Mr. Frollo immediately stated that if this proposal were implemented, it would violate the provisions of the 1912 Hague Opium Conference and the 1925 Geneva Convention. If governments recognize the transportation of narcotics to "Manchukuo" as legal, it would be tantamount to recognizing the "Manchukuo government." Mr. Frollo continued, "The opium scourge in 'Manchukuo' continues to increase. The 'opium monopoly' in 'Manchukuo' encourages the consumption and production of opium. Since 'Manchukuo' has not joined any narcotics treaties, the United States will also be harmed by it." Mr. Frollo advised the League of Nations that "Manchukuo" would soon become the world's distribution center for contraband drugs. If governments recognize the issuance of passports for narcotics transported to "Manchukuo," a large amount of Persian opium, which can be used to manufacture strong beverages, will pass through "Manchukuo" and harm other countries. The League of Nations Opium Committee was shocked by this announcement. Afterwards, the members of the committee held a secret meeting. According to the committee's report, most major countries, regardless of their interests, advocated maintaining the original proposal, but those who opposed narcotics ultimately prevailed. After a secret meeting of the League of Nations Council, it was resolved that governments should not issue passports for the transportation of narcotics to "Manchukuo." This was a bolt from the blue for Persian opium smugglers. Mr. Frollo continued that international smugglers are now planning to undermine narcotics treaties. The air transportation of various contraband is on the rise, which is indeed frightening. (National News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>

Regarding the current pending issue of the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway and other issues, I have heard the outline from the Central Department of the Army. I will go to Changchun this time and immediately take over the affairs from Lieutenant General Koiso. Before inquiring about the intentions of the Kwantung Army, it is not appropriate to express any opinions. My appointment this time will not cause any changes in the situation. 'Manchukuo' is approaching the Soviet Union. Regarding the subsequent issues with the Soviet Union, there will be various issues that need to be resolved. I will study these situations in detail after I take office to seek solutions. It is not appropriate to talk about it here." It is scheduled that Lieutenant General Nishio will arrive in Changchun at 7:30 pm on the 14th of this month. (Japan United News dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Japan Profits Over 300 Million Annually from Occupying Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Dalian) According to a survey by the South Manchuria Railway Company, since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have been able to obtain a net profit of 355.3 million yuan annually. Because many Japanese officials are used in the puppet state, Japanese people can earn 128 million yuan in salaries and wages in Manchuria. Dividends and bond income from investments amount to 94.2 million yuan. Trade profits amount to 91.9 million yuan. Indirect profits amount to 41.2 million yuan. The total is 355.3 million yuan. Future profits can be increased. Other benefits, such as those in industry, politics, military affairs, judiciary, property, and society, are not counted. Japan can still obtain such huge profits. Japan's profits are our losses. (China United News dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Navy to Survey the Aleutian Islands This Summer, Britain also Rumored to be Buying Timor Island</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news released here today, the US Navy will conduct aerial surveys of the Aleutian Islands this summer. Rear Admiral Watts, commander of the Hawaiian Mine Force, will be in charge. The survey team will include two aircraft, a repair ship, and two minesweepers. The survey work will include maritime hazards and climate changes. The Aleutian Islands consist of about 150 small islands, extending from the Alaskan Peninsula in the east to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the west. Most of them are owned by the United States. The local industries are only fishing and hunting. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Sunday Dispatch claims that Britain is now considering buying Timor Island, with a price of about £5 million to £10 million. The owners of the island, the Netherlands and Portugal, seem willing to sell it. Timor Island is in the Malay Archipelago and is mostly mountainous, producing coffee, coconuts, sandalwood, and other items. Britain plans to purchase this as the final stopover on the air route to Australia. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) To the east of Java in the South Seas and to the north of Australia, there is an island called Timor, which is currently co-administered by Portugal and the Netherlands. This island is a strategic hub in the Malay Archipelago and a stopover point before the air route reaches Darwin Port in northern Australia, so it is very important. In recent years, there have been rumors that Japan intends to buy it, which Portugal has denied. Recently, the Sunday Express reported that the British government is discussing the purchase, and it is said that the price will be between £5 million and £10 million. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam Official circles here expressed surprise at the news from the British Sunday Dispatch. It is said that Britain has not contacted the Netherlands about buying Timor Island. However, Britain is currently discussing with the Netherlands the establishment of an airfield on the island in order to expand airmail services between Britain and India and reach Australia.

<h3>The Little Entente Countries Prepare to Jointly Recognize Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Czech Republic to Draft Recognition Documents</p>
<p>Romanian Capital After the documents for the Little Entente countries to recognize Soviet Russia were drafted in the Czech capital, they were handed over to Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu for study. Titulescu has sent a staff member to take the original manuscript to the Czech capital and Geneva. The preliminary negotiations between the representatives of the Little Entente countries will be based on this document. People here seem to think that the Little Entente countries' move to recognize Soviet Russia can be realized in the near future. Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia will probably jointly and formally recognize Soviet Russia through the representatives of the Little Entente Standing Committee. This has been largely determined. This joint recognition method has one advantage, namely, if the three countries recognize Soviet Russia separately, the special relations between each country and Soviet Russia will inevitably cause problems, while joint recognition can avoid this.

<h3>France's Increased Defense Alarms Germany</h3>
<p>France Has 5 Million Reservists</p>
<p>(Paris) Germany and others generally believe that France has the most solid national defense in the world. The French government's proposal to the parliament is still to use huge sums of money to strengthen defense. Germany and others are greatly alarmed. The proposal states that the French Air Force should be reorganized so that it can cope with incidents at any time and anywhere. (National News dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding French Foreign Minister Barthou's recent letter to the League of Nations, the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reported that although French military experts have repeatedly recognized its 5 million reservists as the backbone of the French army, the French Foreign Minister opposes including these reservists in the calculation of formal military strength. Germany has no such military organization comparable to the French reservists. This is because German soldiers who participated in the European War are now at least 35 years old and have not been given military training. In France, all those who are fit for military service are conscripted into the army within a certain period, and all military equipment is fully prepared. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of whether Germany's informal military organization should be regarded as military strength, France's 5 million reservists should be considered first.

<h3>British Conservatives Advocate for Air Force Agreement</h3>
<p>To be Implemented After the Failure of Disarmament Negotiations</p>
<p>(London) When the Conservative Party discussed the disarmament plan, the party's member and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill advocated that Britain should strive to establish a convention to limit regional air forces, only targeting the army and navy, and limiting their use to within the combat zone. It is now learned that the British government does indeed want to conclude an air force agreement according to the aforementioned intentions in the event of the failure of the disarmament conference. In addition to proving this point this morning, political circles said that the current negotiations cannot achieve the goal of concluding a general convention. However, if the opinions of the countries concerned can be approached, the aforementioned air force agreement can be applied not only to limiting the scope of the use of the air force, but also to the number of air forces.

<h3>Germany Values Far Eastern Trade</h3>

Then, he stated the current situation in the Far East, saying that Germany has no direct relationship with Far Eastern politics. However, we hope that the Far East will maintain peace, so we believe that various major political and economic issues in the Far East should be resolved. We dare not judge the relationship between China and Japan. From the surface, it seems that the relationship between the two countries has gradually calmed down. The Chinese government has been striving to stabilize the domestic situation in recent years. We silently wish it success. As for Japan, we should also maintain the same friendly relations with it. We also sincerely wish that the friendly relations between us can be maintained, which is an infinite blessing for both countries. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Hitler's Party Kidnaps Jewish Millionaire</h3>
<p>And Exchanges Gunfire with Detectives</p>
<p>Result: Captured and Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>(Berlin) In the city of Kremmen, a Jewish millionaire named Schlesinger was traveling by car when he was stopped by seven members of the National Socialist Party's Sturmabteilung (SA). They used pistols to force him to transfer to the SA members' car and go to Berlin. Later, he was allowed to telegraph his wife, telling her that he had come to Berlin on urgent business. However, the millionaire was very astute and only wrote his surname on the telegram without signing his name. His wife became suspicious after receiving the telegram and asked her friends in Berlin by telephone. Her friends then informed the police. At the same time, the Jewish millionaire instructed his friend by telephone to prepare several thousand marks and wait for him at a certain place. When the SA members took the millionaire to the designated place to receive the ransom and release him, the police had already received a detailed report and secretly dispatched detectives to lurk nearby. They came out to arrest them, and the two sides exchanged gunfire, but the SA members were eventually captured. The case was judged by the authorities today, and the seven defendants, members of the SA, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to seven years. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

The two maintained their statements to the committee. Chiappe repeated his previous narrative, saying that he had told former Prime Minister Daladier that Frot intended to contact former socialists and former royalists for his use. He had advised Frot to be careful during a private meeting with Frot. Frot explicitly denied what Chiappe said. The investigative committee then asked him who reported the news he had obtained about Frot's activities and asked him to summon that person to testify. Chiappe was unwilling to reveal the name, so he gave up. The confrontation ended at this point. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>German Interior Minister Explains the National Question</h3>
<p>Exclusion of Jews is an Act of Self-Defense</p>
<p>No Discrimination Against Other Nationalities</p>
<p>For several weeks, due to the spread of inaccurate information by foreign news agencies, countries in the Far East have been uneasy about the German government's racial policies, especially Japan and India. They fear that Germany intends to lower the status of other nationalities and that Italy will make them lag behind its own people, leading to self-endangerment. I now dare to declare in the name of the government that this news is not only completely unfounded but also entirely unconscious. The German National Socialist Party's position on racial legislation is based on the preservation of pure race, which is of great importance to the future of the German nation. Other nations, such as those in Asia, also have the same expression.</p>
<p>Among the foreign races in Germany, the largest is the Jewish race. According to the German population, Jews account for only 1.5%. In recent decades, especially since 1918, due to the influx of Jews from the Near East, the power of Jews has doubled in Germany's economy, finance, culture, and politics. Now, let me briefly list a few facts to prove this. In Prussia, there are a total of 11,814 lawyers, of which 3,515 are Jews, accounting for 29.8% of the total. As for notaries, there are 1,945 Jews out of 6,226, accounting for 31.2% of the total. As for the faculty members of German universities, Jews account for about 30% of the total on average, and in the medical schools of the Universities of Berlin and Breslau, Jewish professors account for 45% of the total.</p>
<p>The need to prevent this excessive foreignization has become a matter of life and death for the German nation. Therefore, Germany's racial legislation is purely an act of urgent self-defense, and there is no so-called hatred involved.</p>
<p>In addition, the German government also has a purpose, which is to cultivate the foundation of the German nation and stabilize the movement to preserve pure race. Under this ambition, the German government is absolutely unwilling to make superior or inferior judgments on other races. The German government also knows that other nations have cultures that are deeper and higher than Germany's. If there is any intention of contempt, it is not the will of the German government and its people. I would especially like to state that all foreigners living in Germany can live in peace and work as before. The welcome of German educational institutions to young students from all countries remains the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not surprising that all parties have submitted to the central government proposals on the entire issue of race, such as mixed marriages, requesting the government to resolve them through legislation. This is self-evident given the enormous relationship between the racial issue and the German nation and the enthusiasm of the people for this issue. If foreign countries spread major rumors about Germany's racial legislation, it must be due to misunderstanding or deliberate fabrication of facts. Perhaps it is a misunderstanding of current laws or a misinterpretation of proposed events as accomplished and future facts, which is far from the original intention.

<h3>Russia Captures Japanese Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>Then Releases It</p>
<p>Ranam, Korea—The Tajima Maru, a fisheries research vessel from Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, was fishing off the coast of Primorsky Krai on the 7th of this month. It was suddenly attacked and captured by Soviet Russian officials at 6:50 AM on the 10th in the sea off Askold Island. A telegram from Chongjin authorities reported this, but a later telegram said that it was released at 12:40 PM on the same day. The Japanese authorities are investigating the facts of this case and plan to take appropriate measures against Soviet Russia. (11th Jiji Press)</p>
<h3>US House Passes Bill Authorizing Government to Buy Silver</h3>
<p>Purchasing 1.3 Billion Ounces at Market Price</p>
<p>Also Allowing Purchase of Silver to Pay for US Agricultural Products</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures approved two important bills: (1) Authorizing the Treasury Department to purchase silver to pay for US agricultural products at 25% above the market price; (2) Authorizing the government to purchase 1.3 billion ounces of silver at market price. Within four months after the passage of this bill, 150 million ounces will be purchased first, and then 250 million ounces will be purchased in the following year. Purchases of silver will stop after the price level of 1926 is restored. (10th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures today submitted a report expressing sympathy for the Ford and Taylor silver proposals. The committee passed the Taylor and Ford plans by a vote of 12 to 2 and 10 to 4. The Taylor plan would use silver to subsidize the export of surplus agricultural products, while the Ford plan would establish a monetary reserve commission. The committee initially intended to make a consolidated report on these two cases to reconcile them, but today's meeting decided to handle these two cases separately. The Ford case deemed Representative Shamblen's objections to be insufficient. Shamblen claimed that in the past few days, he would ask the House Rules Committee to make a decision so that the Taylor bill could be discussed in the House as soon as possible. The proponents of the Ford plan also took the same action. They rumored that the two cases might be opened in the House at the same time. House Speaker Rainey told reporters from the Associated Press that he supported both the Taylor and Ford proposals and hoped that the House Rules Committee would pay attention to both cases as soon as possible. Rainey then solemnly stated that although he had not discussed the silver case in the White House, he firmly believed that President Roosevelt had no reason to discriminate against the two proposals. Proposer Ford said that he was very satisfied with the actions of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. Next week, he will ask the House Rules Committee to quickly discuss the Ford plan. Ford explained his proposal, saying that the design of this case is to restore national monetary management. Once this case becomes law, we will have completed an important step in monetary legislation, because this case can guarantee the permanent prosperity and stability of the United States. Ford continued, "The silver dumping by the Indian banks in 1928 and 1929 resulted in the devaluation of silver and the overdevelopment of silver mines. The world recession is rooted in this." Ford also insisted that if the United States takes appropriate action on the silver issue in a timely manner, he believes that it will definitely be able to eliminate all recession phenomena.

<h3>Yan Xishan Recuperating in Hebian Village</h3>
<p>-Military Affairs Entrusted to Xu Yongchang and Fu Zuoyi-</p>
<p>-News of the Campaign Against Sun殿英 is Very Quiet in Taiyuan-</p>
<p>Taiyuan News, since Sun Dianying led his troops westward, the authorities in Beiping initially wanted to mediate peacefully and sent representatives to Jin for negotiations. One after another, small Taiyuan has become the center of the northwestern situation. Later, the central government decided to use force to restrain Sun, and mediation was abandoned. The Jin side followed the orders of the central government. Although they had a considerable historical relationship with Sun in the past, they could not help at this time. Therefore, they have designated the Jin-Sui army to move out. However, Yan Xishan returned to Hebian to serve his father, who was ill at home, a few days before the Lunar New Year's Eve last year. Recently, he also felt unwell himself and rested in his hometown. It is heard that Yan is scheduled to come to Taiyuan within a week. Yan has ordered the Jin-Sui armies to entrust all military affairs to the central government's command. The other day, Jin Chairman Xu Yongchang and Sui Chairman Fu Zuoyi were summoned by He Yingqin, Acting Chairman of the Beiping Military Council, to Beiping to discuss the military affairs of suppressing Sun. Yan entrusted all detailed measures to Xu and Fu for detailed discussion in Beiping. Since then, the focus of the military affairs of suppressing Sun has completely shifted to Beiping. Although the Jin-Sui armies have actively mobilized, news about this in Taiyuan is quieter. The troops mobilized by the Jin-Sui armies this time, in addition to a division directly under Fu Zuoyi stationed in Suiyuan and a division under Wang Jingguo, the rest are Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry stationed in Datong and Feng Yuxi's brigade stationed in the Zhaoyun area. There are no military preparations in the Jinyuan and inland areas. Currently, Sun's personnel in Taiyuan have dispersed invisibly, and although there are still some garrisons in Jincheng, they have been taken over by the Jin side. Jin Chairman Xu Yongchang completed his official duties in Beiping and returned to Taiyuan this (7th) afternoon. He is scheduled to go to Hebian tomorrow morning to report to Yan. After the departure of Zhao and Feng's troops in northern Jin, the remaining defenses will be maintained nearby by Li Fuying's division stationed in Yanggao. Li returned to Taiyuan the other day and also went to Hebian this morning to visit Yan for instructions before returning to his defense. In addition, Fu Zuoyi needs a lot of military supplies for his troops to go west. In addition to being replenished by the Beiping Military Council, a large batch of miscellaneous goods was also transported from here yesterday, starting from the Zhengtai Railway and transferring to Ping to transport to Sui.

<h3>Methods for Handling Land in Recovered Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>‖Return Property Rights to Original Owners‖</p>
<p>‖Farmers to Have Land to Till‖</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The border areas of provinces such as Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan have been ravaged by bandits one after another. In bandit areas, land boundaries and contracts have been destroyed by the various levels of "Soviet" regimes of the Red Bandits, and land has been divided for "communal production." Now, with Generalissimo Chiang leading large military groups to suppress the bandits, bandit areas are being recovered in succession. Detailed plans have been made for the land reorganization, cultivation arrangements, and rural reconstruction. The short-term measures are being implemented steadily, and the fundamental solutions will be realized one by one once the eighteen million yuan for fundamental governance allocated by the National Government is received. Currently, the field headquarters is carrying out post-banditry measures in rural areas in three major areas: (1) establishing rural reconstruction committees at all levels to clear land and ensure security of property rights, so that farmers have land to till; (2) widely establishing agricultural cooperatives to lend funds so that farmers can purchase cattle and seeds; and (3) abolishing all land rents during the period of bandit occupation, prohibiting pursuit of arrears, and gradually clearing debts. Among these, regarding the handling of land divided by bandits, to confirm property rights and ensure that tillers have land, the field headquarters has formulated a question-and-answer format to explain everything. The original text is as follows:</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers for the People Regarding Land</h3>
<p>(Question 1) After the recovery of counties occupied by the Red Bandits, how will the land be handled? (Answer) The principle is to return all land to the original owners and confirm their property rights, while also ensuring that tillers have land to cultivate. (Question 2) What is the method to ensure that all tillers have land to cultivate? (Answer) A peaceful method of land allocation based on population. All those in the village who can cultivate land, whether they were the original tenants, or the cultivators who took over after the Red Bandits came, or those who have recently returned home, can be allocated land to cultivate. Even if a household does not have strong laborers, as long as someone is hired to cultivate on their behalf, they can also be allocated land. The emphasis here is on equitable cultivation, ensuring that tillers have land to cultivate, not dividing land based on population or using violent and predatory means to equalize possessions. (Question 3) If landlords own a large amount of land, I'm afraid it will be difficult to thoroughly ensure that tillers have land to cultivate, right? (Answer) The land management regulations stipulate restrictions on private land ownership. The township or town rural reconstruction committee will consider local soil, population, and family circumstances, and limit the area of land owned by each landowner, from 100 mu to a maximum of 200 mu. Land exceeding this limit will be subject to ordinary land tax, and an additional progressive income tax. The revenue from the progressive tax will not go to the national treasury but will be lent to rural cooperatives to facilitate agricultural capital. (Question 4) Which organizations will handle the return of land to the original owners and land allocation based on population? (Answer) All disputes and post-disaster matters related to land will be handled by the rural reconstruction committee or agricultural cooperative preparatory societies. After all matters are handled, they will guide owner-farmers, tenants, and landowners to jointly organize rural agricultural cooperatives for management. (Question 5) What is a rural agricultural cooperative? (Answer) It is jointly organized by nine or more owner-farmers, tenants, and landowners to manage the land together and operate separately. All equipment for cultivation, farming techniques, disaster prevention, pest control, etc., are planned and managed by the cooperative to be used separately by its members. Moreover, all rural affairs such as transportation, education, hygiene, security, childcare, and entertainment, as long as they can adjust material resources and increase production efficiency, are provided by the cooperative. Thus, rural land is either leased or purchased by the cooperative, and the villagers are all members. The members are completely like all the tenants or all the landowners, who can of course use and operate together. The nature is gentle, and the means are still active. This avoids the disasters of land revolution and can achieve the practical effect of collective farms. This is the most appropriate method to socialize land. (Question 6) What are the procedures for returning land to the original owners? (Answer) There are four methods: 1. With deeds and boundaries; 2. Without deeds but with boundaries. For those with deeds, the owner submits the deed, and after the township or town rural reconstruction committee verifies its authenticity, it is assumed to be registered. After a month of public notice, if there is no objection, the ownership is confirmed and a management certificate is issued. For those without deeds, a guarantee from two or more members of the township or town rural reconstruction committee is required, and a written statement is issued. After verification of authenticity, the matter is submitted to the county rural reconstruction committee for review. After three months of public notice, if there is no objection, the ownership can be confirmed and a management certificate is issued. 3. With deeds but without boundaries; 4. Without deeds and without boundaries. The procedures for those with deeds are followed, and the township or town rural reconstruction committee considers the geographical situation and divides the land into several small areas, convenes a meeting of landowners in the area, and determines the boundaries. If a landowner's land is scattered, it can also be combined into a whole piece for easier management. However, when forming a whole piece, if someone benefits, they should pay compensation, and those who suffer a loss will be compensated by others. This is very fair. (Question 7) How is land allocation based on population carried out? (Answer) Those who have land to cultivate report the number of mu of cultivable land, its location, and the number of people in the family to the rural reconstruction committee, who then verifies the household registration and determines the allocation. (Question 8) The farmers' farming implements have all been taken by the Red Bandits, and they have no capital. How can they cultivate the land after leasing it? (Answer) The government has assigned rural relief instructors to each county to organize agricultural cooperative preparatory societies in villages and towns, bringing funds and preparing to lend them to farmers at very low interest rates. As long as they participate in the organization of the cooperative, they can borrow money. (Question 9) What should be done with debts owed in the past? (Answer) The term will be extended by two years, and they can also be reduced for repayment. (Question 10) What about the rent owed in grain in the past? (Answer) All arrears will not be pursued. (Question 11) What are the methods for paying grain? (Answer) Depending on the severity of the bandit damage and the timing, there are four types: full exemption, exemption, reduced levy, and deferred levy. Separate provisional measures for reducing and exempting land taxes have been formulated. (Question 12) How much rent should be paid each year after leasing land for cultivation? (Answer) It will generally be lower than before, as determined by the township or town rural reconstruction committee after investigating the customs of the village. (Question 13) If landlords randomly increase rents and evict tenants after recovering their land, won't the farmers still not have land to cultivate? (Answer) After the land rent is determined, whether it is managed by the rural reconstruction committee on behalf of the owners or by the owners themselves, random rent increases are not allowed. Except for one's own land, before the confirmation of property rights, those who have not been allocated land or who have abandoned cultivation or indulged in vices, tenants who have been allocated land by the township or town rural reconstruction committee shall not be replaced or have the number of mu they lease reduced.</p>
<h3>Generalissimo Chiang's Message to the People</h3>
<p>People who have survived the calamity, the Red Bandits massacred your relatives, plundered your property, laid waste your fields, and destroyed your homes. Now, returning after the disaster, you have nothing left. This is so heartbreaking. However, in the midst of this deep pain, whether you are wandering back to your hometown or defecting from the bandits, you must clearly understand that all the past suffering and losses were caused by the Red Bandits. You must not harbor resentment against each other or hold grudges. You should work together, overcome all difficulties, revive the hometown where your ancestors' graves are located, rebuild, and establish a foundation for permanent and happy living. There are a few points that should be warned and instructed to you: (1) The fields where your lives are entrusted have been messed up by the Red Bandits. The government has established rural reconstruction committees at all levels to implement cleaning up, so that property rights can be guaranteed and farmers can have land to cultivate. (2) You do not have funds to engage in farming. The government has organized agricultural cooperative preparatory societies to lend funds, so that everyone can cultivate and have food to eat. (3) Do not dwell on the losses you have suffered in the past. For example, landowners have not received rent on their land, debts have not been settled, and farmers in the villages have been wrongly accused of dividing other people's land but have not received any benefits. Now, the government has formulated a compromise and fair method, which is to exempt old rents and gradually clear debts. Landowners should understand that tenants were forced to join the bandits in the past to make a living. Tenants did not intend to divide the land and did not enjoy any benefits. Forcing them to repay rent is not reasonable. As for past debts, the reason for extending the term or reducing the repayment is that the debtors currently have nothing and are unable to clear the debts. Tenants and debtors should understand that they were indeed threatened and trampled upon by the bandits during the period of banditry, but the refugees who fled suffered even more, wandering for years. Now, when they return from afar with nothing left, they are willing to exempt rents and reduce prices, enduring pain to help each other. This is a fact that deserves admiration and gratitude. People who have reunited after the disaster, the government has made great determination and full preparation to seek the stability of order in the recovered counties and the prosperity of rural areas. You should understand each other, help each other, and carry forward the mentality of coexistence and co-prosperity, benefiting yourself and others. Under the leadership of the government, unite as one and work hard to move forward, embarking on the bright path of peace and happiness. If you disregard the locality and only seek personal gain, returning home to extort by force, or those in the villages persisting in evil without repentance, causing disputes, the government, for the sake of maintaining order and the interests of all the people, will punish them severely according to the law and will not tolerate them. This is what the people who are in the same boat through thick and thin should pay special attention to. In short, all the past is gone, and it is not allowed to dwell on them one by one. Everything in the future is long, and depends on the concerted efforts of all the people. Now the government is doing its best to help you. You must understand the government's difficulties, unite as soon as possible, and work together for the prosperity and permanent residence of your hometown. Work hard, people who have reunited after the disaster! (8th)</p>
<p>Nancheng Detachment: On the 4th of this month, they searched and suppressed the remnants of bandits in the Dazhu area. On the 5th, more than ten bandits, including Yu Debao, killed the bandit leader Liu Fanghuai, the fake county committee member of Jianzhong, and the fake captain Chen Shikui, etc., and surrendered to our First Brigade with four guns. Liu Qianjun, the magistrate of Nancheng County, believed that Yu Debao and others had a deep understanding of righteousness and came back on their own initiative. Yesterday, he telegraphed Generalissimo Chiang and Chairman Xiong to request awards to encourage them to return.</p>
<p>Guixi Security Regiment: On the 6th, they followed the army to suppress bandits. On the afternoon of the 8th, they led the fourth and fifth squadrons, departing from Xifang and arriving at Kouyuan Road. The next morning, they occupied Jiejiefeng and the Liu family in Jitian, rescuing more than 400 refugees. They were sent to the Qiushou refugee camp in Zhongcun. They were all without clothes and food, crying with hunger and cold. Magistrate Zhou of the county telegraphed the provincial government yesterday, requesting the Disaster Relief Department to quickly allocate urgent relief to appease the victims.</p>
<p>Field Headquarters Announcement: On the 4th of this month, the entire 37th, 38th, and 39th regiments of the fake 13th Division attacked the positions of the 79th Division in Jinzhu and Tongqian in the right wing of Gugang. Starting from noon, they launched repeated assaults with great ferocity. Our soldiers calmly responded and were also subjected to machine gun fire, and aircraft and mortar bombardment. By 7 PM, the bandits could not withstand it and completely collapsed, scattering towards Taihexu Tangdu. It is estimated that 700 to 800 bandits were killed or wounded, and more than ten were captured, along with more than ten guns. Few survivors remained in the fake 37th Regiment. Our side suffered only six or seven soldiers killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Gan County Dispatch: Since last winter, the First Team Training Regiment has been concentrated in Tangjiang, killing dozens of bandits. After active training, at the beginning of spring, they were ordered to defend Shashibu, Dabu, Wangmushadu and other places. With the strength of one regiment, they defended four important towns. The importance of the task is evident. The First Battalion of the regiment, stationed in Dabu yesterday, reported that there were more than a hundred bandits in Niuling'ao who often harassed the area 30 to 40 li from Dabu, causing great distress to the people. Battalion Commander Wu of the battalion personally led the second and third companies yesterday to encircle and suppress them. They departed from Dabu at 11 PM and arrived at their destination at 8 AM the next morning due to the rugged and difficult roads. They immediately launched a frontal attack. More than a hundred bandits stubbornly resisted from their positions. After about half an hour of fighting, the bandits could not withstand it and fled to the mountains. Our army briefly pursued them due to the overlapping mountains and then returned to the team. It is estimated that more than 20 bandits were killed in the battle, two were captured alive, and two Russian-made Sannuo rifles, one locally-made Mauser rifle, one pistol, a red flag, and a large number of fake propaganda documents were captured. After this suppression, the remnants of the bandits in the area should be somewhat restrained.</p>
<p>Gan County News: According to refugees who escaped from the bandits in Donghe, the bandit situation is quite detailed. Excerpts are as follows: The heads of districts and townships within Gan County, upon hearing that our army had arrived in Xingguo, were very frightened. Their families have now been sent to Yudu. The fake Gan County Soviet government at the village level, fearing our army's suppression, ordered the district and township governments to require all men between the ages of 12 and 50 to provide their own bird guns and be organized into bandit troops to be sent to the Jiangkou area. It also ordered each family to contribute five sheng of rice and ten copper coins, which had to be sent to the fake township government within a time limit and forwarded to Jiangkou for the food of the conscripted people. In the Jiangkou area, there are recently more than 200 fake guerrilla soldiers of Xingguo and more than 300 people who have been levied and organized into troops. All of them are holding spears and are now carrying out defensive work there. The conscripted people are very resentful and are all thinking of taking the opportunity to escape. Not far from Jiangkou, in Wutan Nantang, there are more than 80 people stationed in the so-called newly compiled fake model battalion. As for the Maodian area, there are more than 400 people in the fake independent division, 300 people in the second team of the fake Gan County guerrilla, and 300 more people who have been conscripted.</p>

<h3>Henan Bandit Wang You Joins Forces with Liu Guitang</h3>
<p>Lushan and Nanyang Ravaged by Bandits</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The 13 counties in western Henan, such as Linru, Lushan, Jiaxian, Baofeng, and Wanshu, have long been a haven for bandits. In recent years, major bandit gangs in Central China, such as Xiao Liushao, Gu Dashen, Ma Xiyou, and Wang You, have all originated from here. Since the middle of last month, the Liu Guitang bandits crossed the river through Mengjin, Xin'an, Mianchi, harassing Luoning and Shaanzhou, and arrived at Lushi. They then fled east to Songxian. Because the Henan bandit Cui Bangjie served as the division commander of the bandit army and communicated with Xiao Ma and others, Wang You's gang, after fleeing back from the Shaanxi border, Cheng Daorong, Yang Xiaohei, Xiao Liushao, Gu Dashen, Ma Xiyou, and others also took advantage of the situation to advance north. Although the troops of Zhang Fang of the 20th Route Army and the Wanzhou militias jointly intercepted them, Xiao Ma and other gangs failed and fled into Yinxian in Hubei. However, Wang You had already joined forces with the Liu bandits in Lushan. As a result, areas such as Danxi Temple Caodian in Nanzhao, Qiaotou, XInji, Donglou, Qiqi in Nanyang, and Jiaokou, Fenshiling, Sizhushu in Lushan, and Qihe Town in Fangcheng have been devastated. Currently, troops are heavily deployed along the Pinghan Railway from Xinyang to Zhengzhou to prevent them from crossing the road to the east. Denxian and Nanyang are also preventing them from collapsing to the southwest and entering Sichuan to collude with the Red Bandits. (9th)</p>
<h3>Qin Dynasty Tile Weight Discovered in Zou County</h3>
<p>Han Dynasty Ancient Tomb in Mingshui to Be Developed</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Southern Shandong is the old capital of Zou and Teng, and its history is long. Ancient artifacts are often discovered and have historical value. Recently, locals in Zou County excavated the ground and discovered an ancient kiln with several ancient pottery artifacts. After identification by experts, it was confirmed that they were tile weights from the Qin Dynasty. After Emperor Qin Shi Huang annexed the six states, he issued an edict to revise the weights and measures of the world. The edict, called the "Edict of the Twenty-sixth Year" by archaeologists, was made on the measuring instruments. Chen Fuqi, a scholar from Weixian, collected a wealth of Qin and Han bricks and tiles. Although he pieced together the edict from broken tiles, he was never able to obtain a complete instrument, which he regretted all his life. The one discovered in Zou County this time is complete and intact, and its preciousness is evident. The weight is circular, with the edict on it. Another two are already broken. When antique dealers heard about this, they bought the complete one and planned to sell it to the Provincial Library. They are currently negotiating the price. It is said that the antique dealers took the two broken ones to Shanghai to sell them to Yu Youren. Yu once wrote to Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library of this province, asking him to verify their authenticity. Wang replied that since the objects were not brought to Jinan, it was impossible to verify them. It is said that they will be transported to Jinan soon.</p>
<p>Recently, an ancient Han dynasty tomb was discovered in Mingshui, Zhangqiu, east of Jinan. The location is about one li southwest of Mingshui Town and about one li southwest of Mingshui Station on the Jiaoji Railway, below the ancient dam. The lintel of the tomb door is exposed above ground, with stone carvings in the shape of sheep's heads. The style is similar to the Han tomb lintel in Weixian collected by the library, and the carving is not very delicate. After hearing the news, the Provincial Library has sent staff to inspect the site and is preparing to develop it in the future. (10th)</p>
<h3>Qingdao-Weihai Automobile Route Survey Completed</h3>
<p>Construction Cost Totals Over 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jointly Funded by Qingdao City and Shandong Provincial Government</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Shen Honglie, the mayor of Qingdao, recently discussed with Han Fuju, the chairman of Shandong Province, the construction of an automobile road from Qingdao to Weihai to facilitate transportation. The Qingdao City Government and the Shandong Construction Department separately ordered the Qingdao Public Works Bureau and the Shandong Construction Department to send personnel to jointly handle the matter. The survey of the automobile route has been completed. From Qingdao to Weihaiwei, it can be divided into three routes: 1. From Qingdao via Jimo, Laiyang, Yantai, Muping to Weihai is one route. 2. From Qingdao via Jimo, Haiyang, Muping to Weihai is one route. 3. From Qingdao via Jimo, Haiyang, Xialin, Wendeng to Weihai is one route. The total length of the first route is 715 li, the second route is 618 li, and the third route is 633 li. The length of the route is related to the travel time. It is best for the Qingdao-Weihai bus to arrive in one day, otherwise it may be inconvenient for passengers. The first route already has buses running, so there seems to be no need to increase it further, and the journey is too far to reach in one day. Although the third route does not have direct buses, most of it already has short-distance buses running. Considering its topography, estimating its engineering, and predicting its future development, the second route is the most suitable, because the products along the way are rich, there are many merchants and peddlers, it is located on the coast, and the distance is relatively short. The sections of the second route and the estimated engineering are listed below:</p>
<p>The second route is from Qingdao via Jimo Zhongqibu Huanggezhuang Xingcun Dongcun Haiyang Xiacun Daolijize Touji Wendeng Caomiaoji to Weihaiwei. The section from Qingdao to Haiyang is a branch road of the Jiaolai District Automobile Road, and the section from Haiyang to Wendeng is also an automobile road. The road surface is roughly formed, and it is not difficult to repair. The section from Wendeng to Weihaiwei used to have buses running, but it has stopped. The section from Qingdao to Jimo is 90 li, and the situation is the same as the first route. The section from Jimo to Huanggezhuang is 106 li. The road surface is still good, but it needs to be repaired. Nine stone bridges and five culverts should be built along the river ditches. The section from Huanggezhuang to Haiyang is 112 li. This section has many mountain roads, but there are no steep slopes. The roadbed is sandy and gravelly, and the road surface is still flat, but the villages it passes through are mostly curved and narrow, which makes driving very inconvenient. The Huanggezhuang Wulong River is where the mountain water from the Wudashan Mountains converges and flows into the sea. Floods occur every summer and autumn, and the villages are submerged. The river is 270 meters wide, and the riverbed is sandy and soft. However, the upstream is only 230 meters wide and a bridge can still be built. Other river ditches that pass through should have 12 small bridges and culverts built, and 13 stone bridges over the river bottom. The section from Xiacun to Wendeng is 140 li. This section is mostly mountain roads, and the roadbed is sandy and gravelly. There are few high mountains and steep slopes, and it can be called a good automobile road with a little repair. 31 large and small bridges and 10 culverts should be built through the river ditches. The section from Wendeng to Weihaiwei is 90 li. The road surface is good, and four bridges should be built. The remaining bridges and culverts are still intact.</p>
<p>Engineering estimates: (1) Bridges: After investigating, it is necessary to build 72 small stone bridges with one or two holes on this line. In addition to requisitioning laborers to transport materials, a total of 5,003 yuan is required for labor and materials. The original bridges have collapsed and need to be rebuilt with raw materials in five places, requiring approximately 500 yuan for labor and materials. The total cost is 5,503 yuan. (2) Riverbed bridges: After investigating, there are 16 river channels with a width of more than 7 meters and shallow water flow on this line, and vehicles can pass by paving soil on the sandy beach. Riverbed bridges may not be built for the time being. There are a total of seven river channels with a width of more than 7 meters and up to 300 meters that must be built with riverbed bridges, namely Wulong River, Aozi River, Jie River, Liugezhuang, Wuli River, Rushanzhai River, and Huanglei River, totaling 1,000 meters. Each meter requires approximately 60 yuan for labor and materials, for a total of 60,000 yuan. (3) Flat road surface: All laborers will be requisitioned, and they will be summoned in large numbers to repair it every year during the spring, winter, rainy season, and agricultural slack season. The cost is not estimated for the time being. (4) Excavation of rocks: Approximately 500 jin of explosives are required for the rocks on the mountains and slopes that must be excavated, calculated at 6 jiao per jin, totaling 300 yuan. 1,000 stonemasons are required, at 8 jiao per work, totaling 800 yuan. The total cost is approximately 1,100 yuan. In summary, the second line project requires a total of 66,603 yuan for labor and materials. It is said that the above-mentioned expenses will be jointly borne by the Qingdao City Government and the Shandong Provincial Government, and construction will begin this spring. (9th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Merchant Association Again Petitions for Tax on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>－Also Urges Fujian and Guangdong to Collect Taxes According to Central Government Regulations－</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The prosperity or decline of Anhui's financial commerce has always been closely tied to the distribution and sale of rice to various provinces. Recently, due to the trend of Japanese rice being dumped in our country, the Wuhu rice market will be greatly affected. The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation has now jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang, Deputy Commander Zhang, various ministries and departments, and the Anhui Provincial Government to forward a request to the central government to increase the import tax on foreign rice in order to prevent the market from being seized and endangering the people's livelihood. The telegram reads as follows: "Respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang Headquarters, Deputy Commander Zhang in Hankou, President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, and Chairman Liu of the Provincial Government: Since the government levied import taxes on foreign rice, the stagnation of rice sales has continued as before, and the value remains low. The reason, we believe, is that rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Anhui provinces is mostly sold in South China. However, because the import tax levied on foreign rice in Guangdong and Fujian provinces is only half of what is stipulated by the central government, foreign rice can still be transported to various parts of South China, seizing domestic sales markets. Furthermore, reports state that Japan, with its surplus rice, intends to dump rice stored in Taiwan and Korea into our country. If we do not act quickly to resist this, we will see rural bankruptcy and the entire industry affected, with the risk of a total social collapse. Now that the Fujian rebellion has been quelled and government orders are unified, we request that the central government order the Guangdong and Fujian provincial governments not to act independently and to have the customs of the two provinces collect import taxes on foreign rice in order to prevent the market from being seized and to protect our country's rice industry. This would be fortunate for farmers and merchants, and fortunate for the entire country. The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Wu Xingzhou, and others bow."</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Local Budget for the 23rd Year</h3>
<p>Only Reduction Allowed, No Increase Permitted</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Will Instruct Counties to Comply</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Finance, believes that with the 22nd year drawing to a close, the local budget for the 23rd year should be prepared immediately. However, due to the extremely low grain prices and the stagnation of all goods in various counties, a widespread phenomenon has emerged. The existing local taxes and levies have already become unbearable for the people. Regarding the preparation of the local budget for the 23rd year, it seems that the local budget for the 22nd year should only be reduced, not increased, in order to alleviate the people's burden. Today (the 9th), the Provincial Government held its 302nd administrative meeting, specifically proposing this case for discussion and approval. It then issued a notice to all counties to prepare the budget based on the aforementioned principle of appropriate reduction without increasing. The original proposal is as follows: "Upon investigation, the local annual budget of each county should be prepared by each county and submitted to this department for review before January 31st of each year, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Provisional Accounting Regulations for Local Counties. The total budget for local revenue and expenditure should be compiled and submitted to the Provincial Government for submission to the administrative meeting for deliberation and promulgation. However, in the past, in order to assess the prosperity or depletion of the people's wealth and determine the standards for governance in each year, it was necessary to first formulate a standard plan at the beginning of the budget process and submit it to the Provincial Administrative Meeting for deliberation before issuing a notice for preparation. As a result, the date for preparing the preliminary budget for each county has slightly changed. Now that the 22nd year is drawing to a close, the local budget for the 23rd year urgently needs to be prepared. After silently observing the financial situation of each county, due to the extremely low grain prices and the stagnation of all goods, the economy of farmers is on the verge of bankruptcy. Even the taxes and levies recorded in the local budget of the 20th year are already difficult to bear. It seems that an appropriate limit should be set. In preparing the local budget for the 23rd year this year, in addition to clearly ordering the reduction of various expenses and not listing them in the budget again, all local county organs and all expenses should be listed according to the figures listed in the local budget of the 22nd year. No matter what the situation, only reduction is allowed, and no increase is permitted, in order to maintain the status quo and alleviate the people's burden. We respectfully request a public decision." (10th)</p>
<h3>Activities of the Shanghai Industrial Inspection Group in Jinan</h3>
<p>Visiting Various Enterprises for Several Days</p>
<p>Members Have Decided to Leave Jinan in Batches</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since arriving in Jinan on the 7th, the Shanghai industrial inspection group has been visiting various enterprises and water conservancy projects for several days, and has been warmly received by the provincial government authorities and various groups. This morning (the 9th), the group visited the agricultural experiment field again. The scheduled visits have now been completed. The group, feeling grateful for the warm hospitality it has received from all walks of life in recent days, hosted a return banquet for all sectors at the Bank of Communications at 12 noon. More than 100 people attended, including Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, heads of various departments of the Provincial Government, representatives of various trade associations, and journalists. Guo Shun, the head of the group, first delivered a speech, followed by speeches by Qian Chengxu, Hu Juewen, Wang Shucheng, and others. The gist of their speeches was that during this visit to Shandong, they saw clear governance, local peace, abundant products, and convenient transportation, and that there was ample room for the development of industry. The results of the inspection were extremely satisfactory, and they were particularly grateful for the courteous hospitality they received from all sectors. After returning to Shanghai, they decided to organize a specific plan and implement the development of Shandong's industry, and to find ways to create close ties between Shanghai's industry and Shandong in order to relieve the people's livelihood and resist foreign economic aggression. After the speeches, Han delivered a reply, saying that he was sorry for the inadequate hospitality to everyone who came to Jinan, and he was very apologetic that they were hosting a grand banquet in return today. He was even more ashamed to hear everyone praise Shandong's politics. Speaking of the development of Shandong's industry, he still relied on everyone's help. Shandong is like a garden, and it needs everyone's cultivation and irrigation before the flowers can flourish. As for himself, he is just one of the many gardeners who carries water. He can only do his best to carry water, and the great responsibility still lies with everyone. He sincerely hopes that everyone will provide guidance. Finally, He Bingru, a representative of the press, delivered a speech, and the meeting ended in joy at about 1:00 p.m. The group, having completed its inspection in Jinan, will go to other places for inspection. Guo Shun, Qian Chengxu, and Zheng Yizhi will take the Jiaoji train to Qingdao this evening for inspection, because Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie has telegraphed to welcome the group to Qingdao. After inspecting Qingdao, Guo and others plan to inspect Huaixian and other places along the Jiaoji Railway, then return to Jinan and then go to Tianjin and other places for inspection. Fang Xianghe, Qian Guanyi, Shen Sifang, and others will return to Shanghai on the Pinghu train this evening (the 9th). The remaining 18 people will all take the Pinghu train south to Taian, Qufu, and other places for sightseeing this evening (the 9th). After the sightseeing, in addition to some going directly to Shanghai, there are still five or six people who will come to Jinan again and go to the Qingdao area for inspection, and then return to Shanghai by sea.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Muslims Organize Religious Doctrine Research Association</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Muslims, because Muslims have always held a closed-door policy, adhering to old habits and lacking publicity, have caused non-Muslims to not understand the content of religious doctrines. Often, those with a smattering of knowledge base their opinions on unfounded rumors and fabricate insulting things. Zhenjiang Muslims, in view of this, have organized the Jiangsu Provincial Capital Religious Doctrine Research Association. Its purpose is to study various religious issues, and it may hire experts to give public lectures, or publish articles in the supplements of major newspapers in the provincial capital and other cities, and if necessary, publish various special publications, or contact bookstores to publish and distribute them on their behalf, in order to widely promote the religion.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Xiyi Small Wheel Reduces Prices</p>
<p>Due to the official opening of the Xiyi Highway yesterday, the number of passengers taking the small wheels traveling between this city and Yixing will inevitably decrease. In order to maintain the current situation, all prices have been reduced by half since yesterday. The four companies involved are Zhonghua, Yonggu, Xinshang, and Zhaoshang. The original price of the smoke shed ticket was 70 cents, and now it is 35 cents. The original price of the cabin ticket was one yuan, and now it is 50 cents, in order to attract customers.</p>

<p>The bandits Lu Mingzhang, Gong Xiaoshand, and Wang Dalang kidnapped the wealthy households Huang Xiansheng and Sha Maoxian in Changxing Town in the Fifth District several years ago, and robbed the Lu family and Zhang family near Ni Jia Zhen. After the county government arrested and interrogated them, they confessed to the kidnapping and robbery and were sentenced to death. The case was submitted to the province for approval. The provincial government has now telegraphed that the two criminals, Lu and Gong, are approved to be executed, and that Wang Dalang, who is not a principal offender and has a lighter crime, should be given a reduced sentence. Upon receiving the telegram, the county government signed and extracted the two criminals, Lu and Gong, at 9:00 a.m. on the 7th, verified their identities, and bound them to the Henan execution ground in the Girls' Middle School to be executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>The standing team of the Hongjiatan Town Security Corps in the county, acting on a tip-off yesterday that bandits were entering and leaving the Chen family in the town, took the team to arrest them. At that time, a patrol officer of the Seventh Water Police Team was smoking inside. Squad Leader Zhou Zhikang immediately reported to the patrol officer Wang Zongtai of the team to handle the matter together. Unexpectedly, Patrol Officer Wang ordered the entire team of patrol officers to load their guns and search for the security corps, and detained the members of the standing team on the patrol boat. The Standing Committee Member of the District Branch, Shen Jianqing, learned of the incident and was horrified by the sight, fearing a major change. He immediately went to see Patrol Officer Wang to explain everything, but instead angered the patrol officer, who ordered Shen Jianqing to be bound and pushed into the cabin and driven away. The citizens of the whole city believed that Patrol Officer Wang had illegally arrested citizens and that the dormitory belonged to the lawless. They telegraphed the Civil Department to request severe punishment.</p>

<h3>Yang Dezhao Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Says Chiang-Chen Meeting to Discuss Bandit Suppression Had Good Results</p>
<p>No News of Wang-Chiang Letter Inviting Hu Hanmin to Beijing</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang in Beijing, returned south a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai on the Conte Verde of the Italian Postal Shipping Company at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. He went to his residence on Avenue Emile Zola. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Yang at his residence yesterday. According to him, he went south this time in response to a telegram from Chiang Tingwen. Chiang had recently gone from Fujian to Guangdong to meet with Chen Bonan to discuss the suppression of the Communist Party. Chiang was deeply concerned that he had not been to Guangdong Province for nine years and was afraid that he did not understand the situation in Guangdong. Before leaving, he telegraphed Mr. Yang, instructing him to return to Guangdong to participate. The Chiang-Chen meeting in Guangzhou to discuss the suppression of the Communist Party had very good results. Because the two sides lacked contact in the previous suppression of the Communist Party, they failed to achieve great results. Now, after consultation, they will proceed based on this result, and considerable results can be obtained in the suppression of the Communist Party. As for the rumors that the authorities will establish joint offices in the southeast for the purpose of suppressing the Communist Party, this will naturally depend on the central government, and the southwest authorities have no opinion on this. The reporter then asked if it was true that Chiang Tingwen had carried letters from President Wang and Chairman Chiang to Hu Zhantang, hoping that he would return north to take office soon. Yang replied that he had not heard of this matter. Mr. Yang also said that Guangdong Province had previously sent Huang Renhuan to Fujian to collect and reorganize the remnants of the former 19th Route Army into Huang Hechun's independent brigade, which has now been completely disbanded. The aftermath of the former 19th Route Army is generally under the control of the central government. As for the central government's intention to return the military expenses previously paid by Guangdong Province on behalf of the north, this was only seen in the newspapers. The Guangdong Province's proposal to borrow 15 million yuan from Hong Kong banks and request the central government's guarantee has been approved by the central government. Recently, there has been no mention of it. Finally, Mr. Yang denied the reports that he had brought letters from Chen Jitang to Chairman Chiang on this trip to Shanghai, and said that he planned to go to Beijing within a few days and did not intend to visit Chiang in Jiangxi.</p>
<h3>French Consul Agrees to Add One Chinese Director</h3>
<p>But Must Submit to French Envoy in China for Approval</p>
<p>Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association Held the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association held an interim Executive and Supervisory Committee meeting at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. Gong Jingyan, Tong Lizhang, Zhu Shengmao, Shang Mujiang, Dong Kechang, Qu Zhenhua, Xu Xiuting, Bei Zairong (substituting), Cheng Zhusun, Zhu Wenqi, Gu Wensheng, Huang Xianggu, Zhou Qinpu, Li Weiliang, Mao Yun, Lou Hongjun, Shen Weiya, Wang Shunfa, and other 19 people attended. Cheng Zhusun chaired the meeting and discussed the following cases: (1) Regarding the request to increase the number of Chinese directors, Du Yuesheng reported that after repeated consultations with the French Consul General, the French Consul General agreed to add one Chinese director, but still needs to ask the French envoy for approval. (2) Regarding the request to ban dog racing and jai alai, a letter will be sent to the French authorities to prohibit them immediately. If this cannot be achieved, further measures will be discussed. (3) Regarding the request of the Fourth Branch of the Citizens' Association to exempt tent donations, this case was negotiated with the Public Works Bureau last year. It is now found that the Public Works Bureau's 94th issue of the bulletin states that all donations for sheds, water boards, and cloth tents are one yuan and five jiao per room per year, which is roughly the same as the amount negotiated last year. (4) The Sauce and Wine Industry Association sent a letter requesting the transfer of the Public Works Bureau to reduce the amount of hotel donations. Upon investigation, the original donation amount and the increased donation amount were not listed in the letter, so there is no basis for it. After the original letter writer has supplemented the information, it will be reviewed and transferred. (5) The China-Germany Hospital requested a letter to the Public Works Bureau to exempt the hospital's housing donations. It was resolved to approve the transfer of the letter, and after receiving a reply from the Public Works Bureau, it will be transferred. (6) Representatives of the rickshaw industry association came to the meeting to petition. Representative Zhang Huaiyang described the situation of unemployed rickshaw operators. The association has replied in accordance with the letter from the French Public Works Bureau, and will assist them within a possible scope in the future.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Major General Jiang Minsheng's Letter to the People of the Country</h3>
<p>Pu Yi is Willing to Be a Puppet and Usurps the Title of Emperor</p>
<p>The People Should Express Unanimous Condemnation</p>
<p>New News Agency: Anti-Japanese Major General Jiang Minsheng, on the grounds that Pu Yi is willing to be a puppet and usurps the title of emperor, yesterday specifically issued a letter to the people of the country, which reads: To all newspaper offices in the country, to all compatriots at home and abroad, and to the elders of the Northeast: Since the September 18th Incident to this day, for more than two years, the four northeastern provinces have successively fallen. The pain of losing the province and the oppression of the Japanese suffered by the people of the Northeast are known to all Chinese people. But the people of the Northeast are unwilling to be the second-rate candidates for slaves of a fallen country like Korea. The righteous armies in various places are fighting desperately with the Japanese for the survival of our nation and the personality of the country. For two years, they have all suffered failures due to environmental constraints, but they are still disintegrating and continuing to fight with the Japanese. Those comrades who cannot stand their ground have fled to various parts of the country, begging for a living. There are no fewer than tens of thousands of them. They still do not forget their determination to avenge. Now the Northeast will become the second Korea, and if our countrymen still do not think of saving it, then North China and Jiangnan will continue to fall into the plans of the bandits. At this point, our entire nation will gradually perish, and there will be no way to recover the lost land. Only when all countrymen unite and embrace the determination of a final sacrifice can we save even one in ten thousand. It is hoped that compatriots will not be discouraged by the failure of anti-Japanese resistance and national salvation today. We must remember the spirit of Goujian, the King of Yue, who suffered all kinds of humiliation from the King of Wu and tasted the bitterness of national subjugation, and who was able to lie on firewood and taste gall to avenge the country. We must "help ourselves and save ourselves" and "rely on our own efforts," and be determined to restore the lost land, and then fight to the death with the Japanese slaves until we achieve the recovery of our territory. Compatriots, the four northeastern provinces are permanently our country's territory, and we will never recognize the plundered rich land as a pseudo-organization monopolized by the Japanese. Jiang Minsheng bows.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce Telegraphed Request to Reduce Salt Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Changing to a New Balance System Increases Taxes Dramatically</p>
<p>Praying to Allow a Discount to Relieve the People's Suffering</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government's Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Ministry of Finance on the 10th: "Recently, we received a telegram from Sun Yiyuan, representative of the Anhui-Henan salt-consuming public petition group, stating that the Ministry of Finance changed the salt tax to a new balance system. According to the comparison between the market scale and the Sima scale, the tax is actually increased secretly, which is more than 27% higher than the original rate. The tax per stone has increased by as much as 1 yuan and 62 cents. The survivors after the disaster, how can they bear the burden? Therefore, the Anhui-Northern Henan Salt-Consuming Public Petition Group was organized, and Yuanfu was publicly elected to lead the way to the central ministries, Chairman Jiang, and the provincial government to petition for a reduction in tax according to the new market scale. We have already sent a telegram to inform you and pray that you will intercede for the people and agree to strive for a unified solution. It has been verified that Western Anhui and Eastern Henan are suffering from the ravages of the Red bandits, and the people are not living well. The social economy has been extremely depressed, and the people's livelihood has reached its worst. However, the Ministry of Finance, for the salt that the people cannot lack for even a day, is actually using the reform of the balance system to secretly increase taxes. It has not been discussed by the Central Political Committee, nor passed by the Legislative Yuan. It is deceiving the National Government and the people. This is the most disregardful of the people's livelihood. Moreover, our National Government is planning to provide relief to the recovered bandit areas and strive to revive the countryside in order to strengthen the country. The heavy salt tax will be borne by even beggars and shepherds in the recovered bandit areas of Western Anhui and Eastern Henan. After the disaster, relief is not available, how can we increase heavy taxes again and heavily suffer our people? Yuanfu has repeatedly telegraphed the pros and cons and personally petitioned the central ministries, but no approval has been received so far. However, this matter concerns the burden of tens of millions of people in Anhui and Henan, but the authorities have turned a blind eye to it, which is deeply regrettable. We have always looked up to your concern for the people's suffering and your leadership of the masses. We are sending another telegram to pray that you will consider the people's situation, grant us your effort to strive for a solution, and intercede for the people with the central ministries. We will be extremely grateful, etc." In view of this, we hereby telegraph the same to your governments and ministries for inspection and verification. We sincerely pray that you will quickly order the Salt Affairs Department to verify and reduce the collection in order to relieve the people's suffering. This is extremely urgent. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, respectfully kowtows, gray seal.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Revises Timetable for Shanghai-Beiping Through Train</h3>
<p>Up and Down Trains Cross the Yangtze River at Night</p>
<p>Can Be Implemented Starting April 1st</p>
<p>The current up and down trains on the Shanghai-Beiping through train, "301 and 302," cross at Nanjing during the day. In order to facilitate passengers on the Jinpu and Jinghu lines, the two lines had planned to revise the current train schedule and implement it starting March 1st. However, due to the low water level of the Yangtze River, it was inconvenient to cross the river at midnight, and the time was too short, and the preparations were not adequate. With the approval of the Ministry of Railways, it was changed to be implemented on April 1st. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Night Ferry Equipment: The heads of the Yangtze River Ferry Section, Xiaguan Station, Pukou Station, Ferry Station, Transportation Station, and Puzhen Station gathered at the main section on the 6th to discuss sound measures for the night ferry and ensure driving safety, as well as matters related to the setting up of the ferry and hiring additional employees for the night ferry. It is reported that searchlights will be installed on both the north and south banks of the ferry at night, so that the Yangtze River surface will still be as bright as day even at midnight, so that the Yangtze River can run without any obstacles. In addition, the lighting on both sides of the river and other equipment have also been installed. The newly revised timetable will be implemented on April 1st.</p>
<p>New Timetable: After the through train crossing time is changed, the full road train running time is also changed. The Jinpu, Jinghu and Beining roads have negotiated and drafted. It is estimated that train 301, from Beiping to Shanghai, takes 40 and a half hours (including 3 hours and 15 minutes for the crossing of the Yangtze River). It leaves Beiping at 3:05 PM every day, Tianjin Main Station at 6:40 PM, Jinan at 3:45 PM in the evening, Xuzhou at 12:05 AM the next day, Pukou at 9:25 PM, Nanjing at midnight, and arrives in Shanghai at 7:45 AM. The 301 through train from Shanghai to Beiping takes 42 hours and 29 minutes (including 2 hours and 55 minutes for the crossing of the Yangtze River). It leaves Shanghai at 4:00 PM, Nanjing at 11:15 PM, Pukou at 1:40 AM, Xuzhou at 11:10 AM the next morning, Jinan at 8:42 PM, Tianjin Main Station at 7:00 AM the next morning, and arrives in Beiping at 10:29 AM.</p>

The first batch of workers, 185 people, had been recruited, carrying road-opening tools. They took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinfeng ship from Tianjin and were escorted to Shanghai by people sent by the company. They arrived at the South Station at 11:00 AM yesterday and immediately contacted the South Station Chief of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, who needed four cars. At 8:20 PM that night, they were attached to the 417th night freight train and transported to the Zhakou Station to get off the bus and transfer to Lishui to work. The second batch of workers will also arrive in Shanghai and transfer to Hangzhou within a few days.</p>
<h3>The Meiya Workers' Dispute Has Not Yet Ended</h3>
<p>The Meiya Silk Weaving Factory has been on strike for more than eight days due to the issue of wage cuts. At 1:00 PM yesterday, the workers elected 40 representatives to go to the Meiya Jingwei Factory on Malang Road to request a meeting with General Manager Cai. Since Manager Cai was working at the General Management Office on Tianjin Road, he instructed the representatives to go to the General Management Office to meet and prepared a car to pick them up. However, the representatives did not recognize them as representatives and refused to go to the General Management Office. At the same time, more than a thousand workers gathered on Malang Road outside the factory, and the order was disturbed. The French police learned of this and sent police to disperse them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the labor-management dispute at the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory on Malang Road in the French Concession, it has been a week. Negotiations between the two parties are not possible. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, many workers gathered and stood in front of the general factory gate. When the police heard the news, they sent a large number of patrolmen to suppress the strike to no avail. A conflict broke out, resulting in seven workers injured and five patrolmen injured. They were sent to the hospital for treatment afterwards.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Investigates Foreign Alcohol Factory</h3>
<p>A telegram from Nanjing states that Nanyang overseas Chinese Huang Jiangquan and the Ministry of Industry jointly established an alcohol factory, purchased the site of the Haidong factory in Shanghai, and began construction of the factory buildings. All the machines have also been ordered from American companies and can be shipped to China between May and June. The joint venture contract signed at that time stated that no one would be allowed to add an alcohol factory in the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian within ten years. Factories that have already been established will also not be allowed to increase their output, and the government will strictly order restrictions to maintain the factory's business. Recently, Huang Jiangquan found that a certain foreign businessman had set up a winery in Shanghai and believed that the businessman was ignoring Chinese laws and intending to compete with the factory's business. Therefore, he specially submitted the articles of association and share subscription form to the Ministry of Industry and requested it to consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find a way to stop it. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered its office in Shanghai yesterday to investigate and report back for review.</p>
<h3>Silver Workers Continue Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>The General Labor Union Sent People to Advise Them to Eat</p>
<p>The Red Cross Sent a Doctor to Diagnose the Condition</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Chen Yongchang and other 17 external workers in the local silverware industry announced a hunger strike on the 3rd of this month. Yesterday was the seventh day, and they still have not resumed eating. The Municipal General Labor Union sent people to express their condolences yesterday and advised them to eat. The Red Cross also sent doctors to examine them. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>‖The General Labor Union Advises Them to Eat‖ The Municipal General Labor Union stated that according to a report submitted by the Silverware Industry Labor Union, 17 workers, including Chen Yongchang, have been unable to resolve the dispute and are experiencing financial difficulties, so they announced a hunger strike starting on the 3rd as a last cry for help to urge the capitalists to wake up. Considering that the hunger strike is related to physical health, and in order to prevent accidents, they specially dispatched standing committee member Gong Yuting to the Silverware Industry Guild on Datongmen at noon yesterday with half a dozen bottles of milk to express condolences to the workers and immediately advised them to eat a little. The workers were mentally exhausted, so they reluctantly drank a little milk, but they still refused to eat and seemed extremely determined.</p>
<p>‖The Red Cross Sends a Doctor to Examine Them‖ The Chinese Red Cross believes that the hunger strike of the two silverware workers is related to life-threatening risks, so the General Assembly sent a letter to the 16th Pu Branch, instructing it to send doctors to examine them and find ways to provide relief. Yesterday, the branch sent Dr. Lu Hongyuan to examine them. The workers were pale and mentally languid because they had not eaten for seven days and nights, and the situation was very tragic. After the doctor gave some medicine water, he believed that there was no imminent danger and said that if they did not resume eating, the condition would likely worsen. At that time, the workers will be sent to the hospital for treatment to protect their lives.</p>

<p>Kalachakra Dharma Assembly Elects Duan Qirui as Chairman</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, Xu Shiying and Six Others as Vice Chairmen</p>
<p>Decision Made Yesterday by Founders and Board of Directors</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, and others initiated a request for the Panchen Lama to come to Hangzhou to establish a Kalachakra Dharma Assembly. After obtaining the Panchen Lama's consent, preparations began in Shanghai. Yesterday at 5 PM, a meeting of the founders and board of directors was held at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendance: More than fifty people including Chu Minyi, Duan Qirui, Zhu Ziqiao, Dai Chuanxian, Xu Shiying, Chen Pingnan, Qu Wenliu, De Hao, Li Zushen, Han Dazai, Gao Rifu, Rong Xu, Zhao Yiping, Zhu Bianchen, Yuan Ying, Qian Jingping, Feng Yangshan, Guan Jiongzhi, Chen Weiming, Deng Diankun, Fan Gunong, Huang Hanzhi, Mao Yun, Wang Xiaolai, etc. Xu Jingren presided over the meeting, reporting on the initiation and preparation process, followed by discussions on association affairs.</p>
<p>Origin of Fundraising: Years ago, when the Panchen Lama came to the north, people from the southeast region requested him to come to Hangzhou to transmit the Dharma, but the opportunity was not ripe at the time. In the summer of the 20th year of the Republic, people from Tianjin and Beijing requested to hold a Kalachakra Dharma Assembly. After a year of preparation, it was held in the Taihe Hall in the autumn of the following year. More than 100,000 people were initiated, making it an unprecedented grand event in China. Believers from the southeast region felt regret due to the long distance and limited participation. This year, as the Lama comes to Beijing, people from the southeast renewed their request and obtained his approval. The Kalachakra Dharma Assembly is scheduled to commence on April 28th (March 15th of the Lunar Calendar) at the scenic West Lake. We hereby briefly explain its meaning to our benevolent followers. It is said, "Blessings arise from a foundation, disasters arise from a womb, planting causes yields effects, without the slightest deviation." This has been true since ancient times, and it is especially true today. In recent years, China has been plagued by natural disasters and human calamities, internal troubles and external threats, pressing in on us. The suffering of the people surpasses that of the Five Dynasties of the late Tang Dynasty. Moreover, with the great powers competing to expand their military arsenals, weapons of mass destruction are constantly being developed. Treaties are broken, the economy is declining, and a world war could break out at any moment. The future tragedy will be even greater and more extensive than that of previous decades or centuries, it can be asserted. However, the arrival of this great disaster is said to be the maturation of karmic retribution, and its cause lies in the collective creation of karma. To avert it, only through the united efforts of the masses can we resonate and communicate with the divine. Therefore, in ancient times, whenever disasters struck, rulers would blame themselves and the people would reflect on their actions, thereby summoning divine harmony and averting calamity in an intangible way. However, the human heart is now weakening. Without the blessing of the Buddha's power, it is impossible to eliminate this vast tribulation. The Kalachakra scripture is the head of the Five Great Vajras of the supreme secret vehicle. It discusses the sun, moon, and stars above, and grass, trees, sand, and rocks below, linking them to the essence, energy, and channels of the human body. Those who master this scripture can accurately predict eclipses of the sun and moon, and anomalies in wind and rain. Its vastness and subtlety are truly inconceivable. Furthermore, all sentient beings in the six realms, upon encountering this auspicious cause, even if they have not visited the altar, but through doubt and contemplation, can receive initiation. Even if they have not formally sought the Dharma, but upon hearing the sound of the bell, or seeing the altar rituals, or even hearing the name of the Kalachakra Vajra, they will deeply plant the roots of Buddhism. If blessed by the Guru's dedication, and those good men and women who participate in this assembly, with sincere contemplation, without distance or separation, will all receive the benefits of the Dharma, not only to dispel disasters. According to the records of great Western Region virtue, the First Panchen was once the lord of Shambhala in the future, and will be reborn in that land. Now, we request his emanation to respond to the opportunity. In principle, it should have special merits. In the past, the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties supported lamas and presided over national rituals, which became established precedents. The Panchen is our national teacher. In this time of frequent turmoil and global terror, we should sincerely request him to use his Dharma power to eliminate disasters in the country and pray for peace in the world. However, this matter is of great importance and requires a large amount of funding, which cannot be achieved by the efforts of a few individuals. We should request the benevolent faithful of all nationalities, regardless of country or ethnicity, to contribute according to their ability. By accumulating small efforts into a great mountain and small streams into a vast sea, we can collectively plant good causes, eliminate collective karma, and transform misfortune into blessings. All depends on this undertaking.</p>

<p>Two Letters from the Panchen Lama: The Panchen Lama's letter to Duan Zhiquan reads, "To the esteemed Zhigong, I received the letter brought by Mr. Yiting the other day in Beijing. I respectfully acknowledge your sincere request to establish a Kalachakra Dharma Assembly in Hangzhou to pray for peace, which I will comply with to fulfill your expectations. However, I and the Tibetan monks are accustomed to living in border regions and are not used to the heat. I hope you and others will discuss and arrange for the event to be held earlier. For other minor matters, I have sent my Khenpo Losang Jianzan, Da Zhuoni, and Zhu Haishan, along with Mr. Chen Yuanbai and others as representatives to discuss in detail and handle separately to fulfill your expectations. I respectfully reply to this with my best wishes for your well-being. Panchen Erdeni." Another letter to President Dai reads, "To the esteemed President Jigong, recently, Messrs. Yuanbai and Yanwu came to Beijing and I had the honor of receiving your letter. Although my illness has not fully healed, my spirits are stronger than before, please be relieved. Secretary-General Chu is also coming to Beijing and will also be going to Hangzhou to establish the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly to pray for world peace. If sentient beings have wishes, how can I refuse? I can only offer my best efforts to meet your expectations. However, my illness has not fully healed and the weather is getting hotter, I dare not stay in the south for too long. I hope you will discuss with other gentlemen to prepare quickly and hold the event earlier. Also, the location for building the altar should be a high and cool courtyard to avoid the Tibetan monks suffering from the heat. For everything else, I have sent Losang Jianzan, Da Zhuoni, and Zhu Haishan, along with Mr. Chen Yuanbai to discuss in detail. I specially reply to this with my best wishes for your journey. Panchen Erdeni."</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Raw Opium Intercepted at Zhongshan Road Intersection</h3>
<p>Four Large Packages Weighing 6,080 Ounces</p>
<p>Equivalent to 318 Catties by Apothecaries' Weight</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 5 AM, detective Hu Rui of the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a tip-off that someone was using a car to transport a large quantity of raw opium via Zhongshan Road and Hutai Road to Liuhe. The detective immediately reported to the team and was dispatched to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei. Chief Lai immediately ordered patrol officer Wang Fulin to wait at the intersection of Hutai Road and Zhongshan Road. A car with license number 12422 was seen speeding from south to north. When it reached Hutai Road, patrol officer Wang and others blocked its path. Only the driver was found in the car. A search of the car revealed four large packages of raw opium. The driver was immediately ordered to drive back to the Fourth District. After questioning by District Officer Zheng Zuhan, the driver confessed that his name was Lu Amao, 31 years old, from Jiading, and he was a farmer. He said, "This opium is not mine. A friend asked me to deliver it, but I don't remember this friend's name. There are four large packages of opium, all in their original packaging, and no one has touched them. They were transported by a car from the Dazhong Automobile Company on Lafayette Road in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, I was stopped by your district personnel at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Hutai Road." After verifying the confession, the officer, wanting to know the exact amount of opium, immediately ordered people to borrow a large scale. It was weighed and found to be a total of 6,080 ounces, equivalent to 318 catties by apothecaries' weight. Subsequently, due to the case involving opium prohibition, it was ordered to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wang Deyu, Who Murdered an Elementary School Student, Appeals</h3>
<p>Disagrees with the Original Death Sentence</p>
<p>Requests Redress from the Third Branch of the Higher Court</p>
<p>Ding Yin, a widow from Wuxi, owner of Ding Juxing Iron Shop at No. 658 Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai, had been widowed for a long time. She had a 15-year-old only son, Ding Fugeng, who was studying at the Sino-French School in the Eight Immortals Bridge area of the French Concession. Due to the long commute, he boarded at his uncle's house on Laohai Road. Suddenly, on the afternoon of October 15th of last year, during lunchtime, he was lured to the wasteland cotton field near the Xuan Family Residence of the Longhua Cement Factory and hacked to death. After the case was reported, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau successively arrested Wang Deyu, the son of the deceased's married uncle and the main suspect, and Zhou Ayuan, an accomplice suspect from Jiangyin, in Nanxiang and this port. After learning that the location where the deceased was lured to was in the French Concession, the French Concession Police deemed the case should be handled by them. They dispatched detective Bao to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to take Wang and Zhou back for investigation and then transferred them to the Second Special District Local Court. The Police Lawyer filed a public prosecution for premeditated murder. After repeated court hearings, Wang Deyu was sentenced to death for premeditated murder and deprived of his civil rights for life. Zhou Ayuan was acquitted. This was reported in previous newspapers. As for Zhou Ayuan, after the appeal period passed, the Police did not appeal, and he was released by the court. However, Wang Deyu was dissatisfied with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. In his appeal, he completely overturned all the points of confession admitting murder in the original trial, denied the murder, and argued that even if the deceased had property, he, the appellant, would not be able to obtain it after murdering the deceased, so why would he kill the deceased? He denied knowledge of the deceased's murder and claimed that the original judgment was unjust and requested redress. After receiving the appeal, the High Court, led by Judge Guo Dezhang, along with Judges Fan Peien and Sun Honglin, and the prosecutor, held a hearing the day before yesterday. Lawyer Guo Shouyi was appointed to defend the appellant. According to the appellant's statement of reasons for dissatisfaction and his request to summon witnesses Zhou Ayuan and Zhou A'er, the defense lawyer added further opinions. The court ordered a postponement for summoning witnesses for further interrogation. The appellant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>YMCA Solicitation Meeting Opens</h3>
<p>The 34th Solicitation Meeting of the Shanghai YMCA was held at the Shanghai Municipal Government in the Jiangwan City Central District at 12:30 PM yesterday. In addition to the Chief Commander Wu Tiecheng, Honorary Chief Commander Kong Xiangxi, Honorary Chief Staff Wang Zhengting, and Mei Liai (represented by Gu Yaofu), Vice Chief Commander Wang Xiaolai, the committee members and team leaders present included Zhang Tingrong, Li Dachao, Li Tingan, Wen Hongen (represented by Li Zemin), Wu Qiding, Yang Hu (represented by Wen Yiru), Dong Kechang, Tan Weixue, Liu Huizhi (represented by Zheng Xiaozhou), Zhang Naiqi, Lu Tianzou, Pei Yunqing, Wu Peng, Zhao Chen, and all the directors of the association, Cao Yunxiang, Zhao Jinqing, Dong XianGuang, Xia Jinlin, Ying Shugui, Shi Zongtang, and others, totaling more than 400 people. Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University in Tianjin, and Yang Yongqing, President of Soochow University, happened to be in Shanghai yesterday and rushed to attend. The proceedings included a luncheon at one o'clock, followed by speeches by Chairman Wu, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Boling, Gu Yaofu, and Cao Yunxiang, respectively. (Chairman Wu's speech is listed below.) The General Secretary of the Association, Lu Ganchen, reported on the general outline of the Solicitation Meeting. All the speeches were broadcast by the Great China Radio Station via short-wave radio from Philips. At 3 PM, a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The opening ceremony of this Solicitation Meeting was hosted by Mayor Wu, and all arrangements were extremely well-prepared. The Municipal Government also opened the entire building for attendees to visit. Yesterday, it rained heavily all day, but the turnout was so enthusiastic. On the one hand, it was due to the enthusiasm of social figures in supporting the association, and on the other hand, it was because the construction of the city center district attracted public attention, taking this opportunity to visit. Based on the observation of the opening ceremony of the Solicitation Meeting of the association yesterday, this Solicitation Meeting will not only achieve success but also exceed its objectives, and the public's desire for the future of the construction of Greater Shanghai can be glimpsed from this.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Opening Remarks: For this membership solicitation of the Shanghai YMCA, Tiecheng was elected by all parties as the Chief Commander. Today, I am gathered here with all the team leaders to jointly celebrate this grand occasion. I have many thoughts and great expectations. The YMCA, as its name suggests, is of course a youth organization, a youth group. Youth not only occupies the most important stage in an individual's life, but also, in its social relations, is the backbone of the social organism, and can even be said to be the foundation of the national life. Therefore, the YMCA organization should not be ignored by anyone who cares about social and national issues. China is facing unprecedented national difficulties. The way to save the country now is to first enable young people to be consistently aware, thoroughly aware. Therefore, since youth is the backbone of the social organism and the foundation of national life, the awareness of youth can make the entire social organism and the entire national life healthy. Saving the country cannot be achieved by empty words, nor can it be accomplished overnight. We must truly and practically make the social organism and national life fundamentally healthy, so that national rejuvenation can have its reality. The youth of China today seems to generally fail to recognize their important position and their important mission. Especially because they have been tempted by the bad social environment in recent years, they do not focus on studying and their character is deteriorating, which is really the biggest danger for our social and national future. Therefore, those who are engaged in social undertakings and who care about national rejuvenation, if they ignore the importance of this youth problem, then they cannot express their enthusiasm and sincerity. The Shanghai YMCA can be said to be the oldest and largest youth group in Chinese history, and observing its various facilities, it can especially focus on the four aspects of moral, intellectual, physical, and social education. It can really be said to be the most powerful organization for training and guiding young people. If the YMCA in the future can deeply understand the source of China's national difficulties, recognize the current needs of the nation, grasp the focus of the Chinese youth problem, and based on its years of experience and enthusiasm in serving the society, further seek the advancement of its work, thoroughly transform the habits of young people, and make them capable of practically shouldering the responsibility of transforming society and rejuvenating the nation, then its contribution to the country will be immeasurable. Tiecheng, taking the opportunity of the YMCA's membership solicitation, would like to express this profound and enthusiastic meaning to the youth of the whole country, to awaken the youth of the whole country. At the same time, I hope that those who manage the YMCA can base on this meaning to seek the innovation and development of its work.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Flood Relief Association of Chongbaoqi Five Counties in Southern Sichuan</h3>
<p>Discussing Important Cases of Spring Relief and Work Relief</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Southern Sichuan Chongbaoqi Flood Relief Association held its fifth joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at Renji Hall on Yunnan Road at 5 PM the day before yesterday. Zhang Bochush, Jin Houcheng (represented by Shi Tongren), Hu Junzhuang, Yu Zuoting (represented by Wang Jingyan), Huang Zhaolu, Huang Renzhi, Sun Xiangshu, Qu Shaoheng, Chen Yanqing, Lu Caifu, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Zhiwen, Wang Dankui, Qian Jingping, Gu Nanqun, Guan Jiongzhi, Gui Yanfang, Chen Guangfu, Fu Zuoheng, Huang Hanzhi, Yang Yusheng, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Weirush, Xu Shiying attended.</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>(Reported Matters) (1) The Jiangsu Provincial Relief Commission sent a telegram from the Dong and Liang agencies, requesting that the work relief funds of 10,000 yuan be remitted by the Shanghai Bank to our association, and that they be distributed separately according to the previously opened distribution list of the seven counties. Our association has received the funds from the Shanghai Bank and has telegraphed requesting that the remaining funds be remitted as soon as possible for combined distribution and closure. (2) The National Tongji University replied to our association that according to the instructions of the Ministry of Education, in addition to the diligent and hardworking students from the four northeastern provinces who are to be granted free tuition by each school at its own discretion, no other cases may be cited as examples, and they have been clearly ordered to comply. It is difficult to comply with the request from the association to forward the letters from the students from Chongming. (3) As of yesterday, our association has received a total of 154,577.56 yuan in relief funds (including 30,000 yuan from the Provincial Relief Association).</p>
<p>(Matters for Discussion) (1) The Haimen Relief Committee telegraphed that the 3,000 yuan in relief funds allocated by our association to the county has been allocated to Committee Member Cai Zhiying to be distributed in the area designated by our association on March 15 after verification, and requested our association to send personnel to supervise the distribution. How should this be handled? Please decide. It was resolved that the association will reply to the committee, requesting that Committee Member Cai distribute the funds carefully and report back for verification. (2) Pu Fukui and five other disaster victims from Shitou Sha in Baoshan County sent a letter stating that the person in charge of receiving the funds for the Sha abandoned the severely affected areas and instead repaired unimportant areas, abandoning the essential and pursuing the trivial, disregarding the lives of millions, and requesting that personnel be sent to inspect and recover the funds. How should this be handled? Please decide. It was resolved that the Baoshan Office should be asked to reply. (3) The Nanhui County Government sent a letter stating that the county was as severely affected as Chongming and even more so than Qidong. The relief funds allocated this time still seem to be somewhat biased. Please allocate more funds fairly to show fairness. How should this be handled? Please decide. It was resolved that the allocation should be made according to the previous distribution list. (4) Deputy Committee Member Wang Dankui sent a letter stating that the work relief in Chongming is progressing slowly due to the dispute between the new and old coastlines. The new coastline is based on the fields, causing the disaster victims to suffer the pain of losing their property, with many disadvantages.

<h3>Private Rent Reduction Association Sheqian Case Also Involves Crime of Forging Seals</h3>
<p>Transferred to Criminal Court for Trial</p>
<p>Wu Yongan, a native of Anhui, was an office worker at the China National Products Sales Company on the upper floor of the Ningbo Industrial Bank. The general affairs director of the company, Wang Jian'e, was a standing committee member of the 17th Branch of the Citizens' Union (North-South Sichuan Road). Wu recently saw that the rent reduction movement suited the psychology of the people, so he forged the name of the 17th Branch and organized so-called Xinshunli Yixingli and other five-lane rent reduction associations, printing and distributing two kinds of declarations, one with the names of the five lanes and one with the name of the 17th Branch, and stamped with an oval seal. However, Xinshunli and others do not belong to the jurisdiction of the 17th Branch, but are under the jurisdiction of the 29th, 31st, and branches. After being discovered by Xu Zhaozhou, a member of the 29th Branch, that Wu had been collecting fees from tenants in various lanes, one yuan per household, he immediately reported the arrest and Wu was detained and sent to the First Special Court, accused of fraud.

Judge Huang then asked Wang Jian'e whether the seal of the 17th Branch on the declaration and the receipt was that of the 17th Branch. Wang replied no, it was a forgery. Huang Jun believed that Wu Yongan had committed the crime of forging documents and seals in addition to fraud, which did not fall under the jurisdiction of the simple court, and should be sent to the criminal local court for trial, so he transferred the entire case.

<h3>Rugao Woman Accuses Bao Fan Worker of Beating Her Daughter to Death</h3>
<p>Zhou Ni, a woman from Rugao, 44 years old, came to Shanghai from her hometown yesterday and went to Sicao Jiadu in Shanghai to accuse Wang Shouyong and Huang Changwu, who opened a bao fan workshop at No. 14 Lixingli, of murdering her daughter. After the district officials questioned Zhou Ni, they learned that her youngest daughter, Zhou Juxiu, was 19 years old. She came to Shanghai last spring because of the poverty of her family. Introduced by the defendant Huang Changyuan, she went to Wang Shouyong's bao fan workshop. Wang sent her to work in a yarn factory, and all the wages she earned each month were obtained by Wang. It has been a year since then, and the family has not received any news. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, I suddenly received an urgent letter from a fellow villager reporting that my youngest daughter was brutally beaten by Wang, and was tortured terribly. Recently, she suffered from sores all over her body. Not only did she not see a doctor, but she was also beaten with whips and sticks, which injured her vitals. She died on the 19th of the first month of the lunar calendar. Therefore, I rushed to Shanghai. Wang knew that he had caused trouble and had already buried the body of his youngest daughter in a coffin. When I repeatedly questioned him, he shirked the responsibility of death from illness. Now my youngest daughter was innocently killed, and I request a serious investigation. Wang Shouyong, 42 years old, from Rugao, lives at No. 14 Lixingli, and is engaged in the bao fan workshop. The woman Zhou Juxiu died because of sores on her body, and medical treatment was ineffective. There was no beating. Huang Changyuan, 55 years old, from Taizhou, introduced the woman Zhou Juxiu to Wang's place. I don't know why she died now. After the district official obtained the confession, because the case was related to the accusation of murdering someone, he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Dance Troupe Director Was Scared and Extorted by Bandits</h3>
<p>Three People Arrested, Each with an Occupation</p>
<p>The song and dance troupe of the Small World Dance Hall performs various dances, which are very popular among social people. Therefore, it has developed greatly recently, and the troupe members are also selected young women of the upper class. The troupe is led by Liu Xiaolu, a native of Hubei, who also takes charge of the dance halls of the Greater World and other entertainment venues. He earns a lot of money, which is coveted by bandits. Unexpectedly, when Liu Xiaolu was directing the dance in the Greater World Dance Hall the other day, he suddenly received an anonymous letter threatening to extort money, demanding a pan of 300 silver dollars in the letter with the surname Cai but no name, please do not be stingy. After receiving this letter, Director Liu was about to discuss how to deal with it. Unexpectedly, he received another letter saying that the words were very strong and instructed Liu to hand over the money near Liu's residence, Yuanqingli, Wusong Road, within three days. Because Liu had no such large sum of money from selling art, he intended to ignore it. Unexpectedly, the other day in the evening, Zhou Boqing (Ningbo native (18 years old)), a waiter in the Small World Dance Hall, happened to be on Minguo Road when three people suddenly asked Zhou if Liu Xiaolu had prepared the silver dollars, and asked Zhou to send a letter to Liu, saying that if he reported to the police or ignored it, it would be detrimental to Liu. Who knows that the three extortionists dared to go to the Small World to watch the play that evening, and were spotted by the waiter Zhou Boqing, who immediately reported to Liu Xiaolu, who immediately reported to the resident's petition police officer Qin Youbiao, who arrested the three extortionists and sent them to the Second Branch Office of the First District of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. After Liu, the director, questioned the defendants, they confessed their names as Wu Wenxiang, (ie, Wu Qiang, also known as Dai Gong) 20 years old, a native of Haining, a customs broker, living at No. 9 Baoruili, Qipan Street, and a member of the second class and sixth regiment of the Guards. Another confessed that his name was Xing Feixiong, 20 years old, from Taicang, a clerk, living at No. 511 Zhaojia Road, and another confessed that his name was Zhu Zhendong, 17 years old, from Haining, living at No. 3 The Bund. They stammered about the extortion of Liu Xiaolu. Director Liu believed that the defendants had jobs, and the amount of extortion was only 300 yuan, which was not a large amount, and there might be other circumstances. He sentenced them to detention pending investigation and verification. However, after Director Liu's detailed investigation yesterday, the defendants were indeed suspected of extortion and sentenced to be sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit for Abuse of Bouncing Checks</h3>
<p>Twenty-nine households, including Zi Da Lumber Company, represented by Qu Jisheng and Xiao Wenzhou and with Jia Lu as their lawyer, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Local Court, accusing Wang Xiankang, Pan Yulin, Xu Yuekang, Zhou Gangcai, principals of Changtai Construction Factory, and Zhu Qizhao, the landowner, of abusing check issuance, violating Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law and Article 363 of the Criminal Law regarding fraud. The case was heard the other day by Judge Zhang Chaozuo. The plaintiff's attorney, Bian, stated that the defendants, Wang Xiankang, et al., contracted to build over twenty houses in Heping Village on West Ash Road last year and successively purchased materials on credit from the twenty-nine plaintiffs. After partial payments, a net amount of over 25,200 yuan remained outstanding. The defendants issued more than ten bank checks with agreed payment dates, but upon presentation, the checks bounced. Zhu Qizhao's checks constituted the majority. The defendants, knowing they had insufficient funds, abused check issuance, constituting fraudulent behavior. Furthermore, the houses in Heping Village had already been mortgaged to others. The defendants colluded, receiving construction payments to divide among themselves while using bouncing checks to deceive creditors. The plaintiff requested a legal investigation and attached a civil suit to recover the debt. The defendant, Wang Xiankang, represented by attorney Jiang Baoli, argued that although Wang Xiankang partnered with Xu Yuekang and others to establish the construction factory, he also advanced significant funds, which have not been repaid, as evidenced by the monthly account books. Wang Xiankang is, in fact, one of Changtai Construction Factory's creditors and should be declared innocent. Zhu Qizhao's defense attorney stated that Zhu Qizhao is a landowner and unrelated to Changtai Construction Factory, requesting the court to consider this. Lawyers representing Zhou Gangcai and the other defendants also presented their arguments. The court declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict for the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Accomplices in Jiaozhou Road Robbery Arrested</h3>
<p>The home of Li Zuxian, resident of 599 Juxing Lane, Jiaozhou Road, was broken into by multiple robbers around 7:00 PM on December 21st of last year. Valuables worth 320 yuan were stolen. The crime was reported to the police for investigation. Subsequently, Detective Wang Chengying and Officer Yang Xiguang apprehended Wang Jiamo, an Anhui native, and sent him to the First Special District Court. After investigation, he was sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment. The other day, Detective Wang, who handled the case, discovered that Wang Mingsheng, an accomplice from Anhui, was hiding at 858 Kang Nao Road. He reported this to the chief and, with the assistance of Western detectives, went to the address and arrested Wang. He was taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The next morning, Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Industrial Bureau's Third Criminal Court presented the facts of the case, requesting temporary detention and further investigation into whether there were other cases involved. When questioned, the defendant Wang Mingsheng gave evasive answers, denying participation with Wang in robbing the Li family's property. He requested an assessment. Judge Xiao Bianfen ordered him back into custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Cigarette Paper Exchange Business on Xinzha Road</h3>
<p>Falling Foreign Exchange Rates and Inconsistent Prices</p>
<p>Unified Prices and Organized Trade Practices</p>
<p>On Xinzha Road in the Public Concession, from Nicheng Bridge to Chi Bang Bridge, there are over a hundred cigarette paper exchange shops, large and small. Due to recent drops in foreign exchange rates and competition among businesses, they have been undercutting each other, leading to inconsistent sales prices. Some are even resorting to selling at a loss to expand their business, disregarding capital and sacrificing profits. If a joint effort is not made to remedy the situation, everyone will face ruin. It is reported that over ten cigarette exchange shops in areas such as Xinkang Lane, Siwen Lane, and the Daitong Road Small Vegetable Market have initiated a plan to promote cooperation and maintain their capital. They propose organizing a "Xinzha Road Cigarette Exchange Industry Joint Office," to periodically invite representatives from all businesses to discuss methods of maintenance. The goal is to standardize exchange and commodity prices and establish rewards and penalties. All businesses will seal and sign the agreement. Anyone who violates or undermines the agreement after signing will be subject to disciplinary action decided by a meeting according to the regulations. They will also fill out forms periodically detailing changes in exchange rates and commodity prices, which will be distributed to all businesses to operate according to the publicly agreed prices.</p>
<h3>City Detective Team Arrests Two Suspects for Extorting 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wang Desheng and Shi Xiaogou Confess Unreservedly</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyao, a local resident, 26 years old, worked as a salesman for a car company and lived at 396 Fangbang Road in the city. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, he received an extortion letter demanding 3,000 yuan, signed "Iron Blood Group." The letter instructed Zhou to show sincerity by placing a red paper on the telephone pole near his door. Zhou complied. He then received a second letter ordering him to dress in Chinese attire (Zhou usually wore Western clothes), wrap the money in a newspaper, and wait at the entrance of Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, in the French Concession between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM on the 9th. Someone would come to collect it. Zhou reported the letter to the Public Security Bureau's detective team. Team Leader Lu immediately dispatched team leaders Gu Liancheng and Hu Kuisheng, accompanied by French Concession detectives in disguise, to wait. Soon, a suspect approached and spoke with Zhou. He was immediately arrested and taken to the team. The suspect identified himself as Wang Desheng, a 30-year-old from Haizhou. He confessed to conspiring with Shi Ziyu to extort Zhou. The detectives then apprehended Shi near the Nanyang Bridge police kiosk. He identified himself as Shi Xiaogou, 28 years old, from Rugao, and also confessed. After questioning, the suspects were documented and transferred to the Judicial Section for investigation.</p>

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Discussion on the Methodology of Reading (I)</p>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>I am 25 years old and currently studying law at a university night school. During the day, I use my tongue to plow, and my monthly income is sufficient to maintain my livelihood. Since childhood, I have been very interested in social issues and often think about ways to solve them. Unfortunately, in junior high school, the books I read were not what I should have been reading. At that time, I had no basic knowledge of social science. Even when reading major works on politics and economics, I only had a superficial understanding. Moreover, the materials were scattered and lacked a coherent concept. I could not grasp the most similar definition of concepts, which led to a superficial approach to reading today. I assumed that what was written in the books was something I already knew, so I skimmed through them, resulting in no clear understanding. Whenever discussing a problem, I could only parrot what others said, only making associations but not thinking independently. Upon reflection, I have read quite a few books, and I consider reading to be the only joy in life. I have made an effort in all kinds of academic subjects, especially in literature.</p>
<p>I have accumulated nearly 10,000 books, but over the past decades, the impression I have is like a mountain landscape in the mist, only vaguely outlining its cliffs. If I want to write a special thesis, I cannot do it without thinking for the whole day. However, when I read what others have written, it is all within my expectations. I do not know why. I sincerely ask for your guidance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have been studying foreign languages for six or seven years. I have worked hard on English, French, and Japanese, but I find reading difficult. I have to flip through the dictionary dozens of times for each page. Recently, I have been thinking about putting more effort into English and Japanese (I only studied French for two years). The university night school offers Japanese elective courses. I plan to take English remedial classes at the China Vocational School. I do not know if I will achieve anything in the future. I hope the elder can shed light on the above two questions, so that I know where to follow in the vast sea of learning. (Letter from Wang Zhaokun)</p>

<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Hobbies</h3>
<p>— Xi Yue</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life work was revolution; his life's hobby was reading. He himself once said, "I cannot live without reading for a day." Besides working and eating every day, he always had a book in his hand. When he was running around for the revolution, traveling overseas, he always carried several books in his suitcase and often studied them carefully. Even on the front lines, directing combat, he always carried books with him. As soon as the military work stopped, he would pick up a book and read it calmly. When Chen Jiongming rebelled, Mr. Sun took refuge on a ship in Shamian. The situation was very dangerous, but he was not at all alarmed. He just sat in the cabin reading Napoleon's biography. He could disregard life and death, but he could not stop reading.</p>
<p>Once, Mr. Sun failed in a revolution and lived in London. Life was very difficult. A friend gathered thirty or forty pounds from the students and sent it to him to support his life. Unexpectedly, three days later, the friend went to his residence to see him and saw that he had already bought a lot of important books with the money and was pointing them out to the friend with relish, explaining what this book was and what that book was. The friend said dissatisfiedly, "Why didn't you keep the money to buy bread and instead buy those books that are not urgently needed?" Mr. Sun said, "Books are spiritual bread, and spiritual bread is even more important!"</p>
<p>Mr. Sun spent a lot of money on books every year. He felt that books were more important than anything else. He had no other property in his life. After his death, all he left to his wife, Ms. Soong Ching Ling, were many books.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun studied so hard, but the purpose was not for himself, but because he wanted to reform China. Therefore, most of the books he read were related to the revolution. In short, he combined reading and revolution into one. On the one hand, he did not forget to read while making revolution, and on the other hand, he did not forget to revolutionize while reading!</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Addiction to Chicken Chicks</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, a prominent figure in the party and the state, also known as the Master of Shuangzhao Building, shows how deep the bond of marital affection goes. He also seems to have a technique to maintain youth as decades pass but his appearance does not age. He still appears to be a young man. He is particularly fastidious about hygiene with his diet. Believing that chicken chicks are the most nutritious, he eats them at every meal. He can consume three chicks in one sitting except when entertaining guests. Someone calculated that he has eaten more than three or four thousand chicken chicks a year. That, alongside the former Tan Chaling's love for shark fin and Yu Youren's preference for chili, makes for some good stories. There are dozens of ways he makes chicken. They can be barbecued, smoked, salt-cured, or wine-soaked; stewed or braised, and flavored appropriately. If they are not prepared so differently, he may not want to eat them. One day, he heard someone mention the methods of cooking chicken in mud, and he tried it to entertain guests. The method is to cut the chicken and mix it with old oil and wine, then put it in a steaming pot. The steaming pot is placed on top of a cauldron, which is slightly salted and contains some water. Then, light the firewood to boil. After boiling, stop. Light it again after 5 minutes. Do this three times, and the chicken will be cooked. This is called "Immortal Chicken." You can also slaughter the chicken without removing its feathers. Use scallions, ginger, soy sauce, and wine to fill the chicken's abdomen. Sew the cracks with thread.</p>
<p>Once it is secured, cover the entire body with cement. Put it over a fire to smoke it. After the cement dries and cracks, throw it hard on the ground. The mud falls off, and the feathers come off with it. Cut it up and eat it. It tastes fragrant and crispy, unparalleled. This is called "Mud-Coated Chicken," also known as "Beggar's Chicken." It is said that beggars have no equipment, so they use simple cooking methods. When the guests ate it, they praised it endlessly, and he was very happy, saying: "No wonder there is a saying that 'after begging for three years, you won't want to be an official.'" Because he often eats chicken, he specially set aside a beautiful room in his house dedicated to raising chicken chicks. There are white chickens, brocade chickens, Taihe chickens, and ruffled chickens. He calls them "Zhilian" ("knowing integrity"), taking from Pi Ya: "Chickens run and eat, always selecting, so they are said to 'know integrity like chickens,'" using this to set a good example for officials. He has always been afraid of being interviewed by reporters, as there are many issues that are inconvenient to publish, and the reporters always repeatedly inquire, which makes it very difficult. He also does not like being welcomed by people in society. In the past, he went abroad for a long time to recuperate from illness, and he did not return for a long time. The people in the country missed him and asked him to return. After returning, he stopped in Shanghai. The people of the country planned to hold a grand welcome party for him. The West Gate and the county government office were decorated with colorful arches and electric lights, shining brightly. Unexpectedly, when the time came, he suddenly took a boat trip to Wuhan. His eccentricity is laughable.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Caohejing</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Caohejing is located southwest of Xujiahui, less than ten miles from Shanghai. Transportation is convenient. The Nanshi public bus can take you there directly, or you can take the French Business Tram to Xujiahui Town and then take a rickshaw for about ten minutes. Last Sunday, at the invitation of Mr. Xi Guansheng, I accompanied my friends Zhang Mengzhou, Chen Zhongying, and others in a car provided by Guansheng Garden, departing from Xietu Road, passing through the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. The road was smooth, and the spring breeze was warm. In the blink of an eye, we arrived at our destination. After getting out of the car, we rested briefly at the Guansheng Garden Farm, which Mr. Xi bought two years ago. The farm covers an area of about thirty acres, with thousands of fruit trees planted everywhere. All the fruits that can be picked and made into candy are listed there. The farm has a plot of land of more than one acre in front planted with almost all kinds of seasonal flowers. There are flower boxes and greenhouses. Four or five gardeners are doing their best. Although it is still early winter, when you enter the area, the colors are dazzling and the fragrance is overflowing, which shows their tireless efforts. In the center, a four-sided hall is built, with a simple and ancient appearance on the outside and a Western style on the inside. Mr. Xi intends to invite guests this summer to use it as a place for cool relaxation and banquets. Behind the hall, a lawn is laid flat, with outdoor tea seats set up in advance. The air is fresh, and you can eliminate vulgar thoughts when looking at the fields. To the right, there are about two hundred tanks of goldfish, collecting famous breeds. Mr. Xi mistakenly adopts humble opinions and appoints me as a consultant for fish matters, so that when the young fish reproduce this year, they can be distributed to customers. The method is excellent, and the intention is beautiful. To the left, a long embankment is like a rainbow, stretching endlessly. The land has been dug to create a pond, and the soil has been piled up to form a mountain. He is currently hiring famous masters to start the layout. In the future, I know that those who are addicted to the dust and fog of foreign fields will definitely compete to go to this place to get a breath of fresh air. There is no hard work of trekking, and you can also enjoy the charm of the wild. Compared to the private gardens that are covered in gold and permanently locked, and the public places that are as high as the roofs, how can they be discussed on the same day? We went to the hall to enjoy some fragrant tea, and then we walked out of the farm for about a mile to the west. The fields were green, and thatched houses were connected to each other. The agricultural villages indeed have a unique flavor. The bridges along the way were newly built, and the route was wide open, knowing that it was built by Mr. Huang Jinrong, a famous figure at sea, with his own funds. I have heard the name of Huang Family Garden for a long time. Today, I am fortunate to see it and feel very lucky. On this day, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's mobile exhibition of agricultural products was held in the garden, and women and children from the surrounding villages rushed to see it, so the number of tourists in the garden suddenly increased tenfold. The Four Teaching Hall is located in the center of the garden. It takes the meaning of Confucius's "literature, conduct, loyalty, and trust." It is beautiful and magnificent, and the furnishings are gorgeous. The inscriptions of famous figures from all walks of life have already covered the space. The flowers, trees, pavilions, and terraces are well-organized, and the small bridges and flowing water are quite ingenious. We spent a short time watching, but I don't know how much effort the operators have put in. To the right of the garden gate, the Caohejing Theater has been newly established. It has not been open for long, but the audience is very large. The prosperity of this place can be expected in the near future. On the way back, we passed through the Cao Family Cemetery and stopped to visit it. There were mountains and water, and it was another world. Comparing it with Huang Garden, there is a clear difference between the greater and the lesser. The victorious tour lasted all day, and the lingering excitement remained. Therefore, I recorded it with a brush.</p>

<h3>The Four Battalion Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p>
<p>Tearful Faces See People Off, Leaving Home for Distant Garrison</p>
<p>Wind and Sand Throughout the Night, Leaving the Pass to Station in a Desolate City</p>
<p>Zi Qiang asked: How are the rooms where the brothers live? Go and take a look. Wang Shili said: No need to look. There are two rooms, both connected. If this room is about to collapse, the other room definitely won't be able to survive. Zhao Ziqiang pondered for a while, then smiled and shook his head twice, saying: It's nothing, we'll talk about it later. Shili saw his expression and knew that he was pretending to be calm, but he also thought to himself that in such a sandy and windy weather, if there were no rooms, they couldn't possibly sleep in the open. Let's see how the regimental commander arranges this matter. When there's no other way, perhaps they'll have to go stay in civilian houses in the middle of the night? That was Shili's guess, but the reality was quite the opposite. In the late afternoon, around seven o'clock, the battalion commander suddenly issued an order to prepare for departure. They had one hour to prepare everything. The four battalion commanders were all a little surprised to receive this order. There hadn't been any movement these past few days, and it didn't seem necessary to depart. Moreover, the weather was so bad, why would they leave unless it was important? That's what the battalion commanders were thinking. The sergeants and those not directly related to the battalion commander were even more confused. An hour later, Zhao Ziqiang was summoned by the battalion commander to receive orders. When he returned, he had a somewhat unnatural faint smile on his face, as if to say that the battalion commander's order was a bit of a joke. Shili certainly didn't dare to ask the battalion commander, so he could only prepare to suffer in this sandy and windy night. Before long, the assembly call was blowing outside. After the entire battalion lined up in the courtyard, they proceeded forward under the supervision of Battalion Commander Bao Fang. They exited Xifengkou and followed the road outside the pass, heading northeast. There were no other troops, just this one battalion. Shili walked beside Ziqiang and whispered: We're leaving, so the house collapsing won't crush us. Ziqiang said: Hmph! If it weren't for the house collapsing, we wouldn't be able to……… (333)</p>

<h3>Housewife's Guide: Economical Methods for Household Goods</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Using Coal: When the cold weather arrives, it is essential to have a stove at home. However, if the stove is not lit properly, it can waste a lot of coal. From an economic point of view, this is very uneconomical. If you have experience in burning coal, then the cost will be low, but the effect will be great. The simplest economical method for using coal is as follows:</p>
<p>In the morning, start the fire in the stove a little larger, allowing it to burn with a flame, the so-called "roaring fire," is what you want to achieve. Add the coal in pieces, piling them tightly together, and pour a little water on top. If possible, do not loosen the coal or stir the fire until noon. A poker for stirring the coal is the enemy of economical coal use, so it's best not to use it unless it's absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a room with a sick person needs a stove that burns all night. In that case, pile two or three layers of small pieces of coal on the grate (or fire bed), and fill the back with coal dust, almost reversing the usual order of loading coal. Now, spread a large amount of paper and wood chips on top of the coal. On top of the wood chips, place layers of egg-sized coal pieces, and finally add some ashes.</p>
<p>Light a match and bring it to the paper, allowing it to burn as much as possible, but do not stir the fire or loosen the coal afterwards. At first, there may be a little smoke, but after a while, the fire will burn steadily and can continue to burn for several hours. This type of stove fire is often successful if lit carefully.</p>
<p>Carpets: Exquisite carpets are very expensive, while low-quality carpets are not very durable. There is now a type of paper carpet that costs little and can keep out the cold. It has considerable benefits in terms of both economy and hygiene. If made and used according to the method, it will definitely be satisfactory. The method of making it is described below:</p>
<p>First, inspect and measure the floor of the room. Remove any tacks or flat-headed nails. If you can't remove them temporarily, hammer them deeply into the floor. If the floor has rough and uneven areas such as broken patches, try to make them level so that you can get a completely clean appearance and a very smooth surface. After these things are done, you can paste several sheets of brown thick paper on the floor, making sure the edges of the two sheets of paper are tightly joined and pasted flat along the edges. Then, paste another layer of any beautifully patterned glossy paper (Western name: Cartridge Paper) on top of the brown thick paper, among which the pattern imitating wood inlay is the most pleasing to the eye. If you cut up useless old clothes into the same size as the glossy paper, paint them with oil paint, and lay them on top, they can be used as a substitute for carpets. This inexpensive, beautiful, and innovative carpet can be washed, can bear weight, and can protect the pasted paper, and the floor does not need to be polished or mopped.</p>
<p>The greatest benefits of pasting this type of paper carpet on the floor are twofold: first, it is airtight and has the function of preventing cold air, because some of the cold air in our rooms comes up from under the floor. Second, there is no place for mold or microorganisms to hide, because ordinary carpets laid on the floor allow microorganisms or mold to sink in and hide in the cracks of the floor under the carpet, making nests and breeding. Now that they are pasted with thick paper, they have no place to hide. Therefore, if the floors in our rooms have many cracks, it is more beneficial and hygienic to use this economical paper carpet.</p>

<h3>The Philippines and Japan are About to Complete Their Preliminary Selections for the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>The Philippines Completed Track and Field and Swimming Selections Last Month</p>
<p>Japan Started Last Autumn and Will Conclude This Month</p>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games, scheduled to begin on May 12th this year in Manila, are approaching day by day, just two months away. The Philippines and Japan are both actively preparing. Only China has not yet prepared. It was only the other day that the board of directors of the National Sports Association decided on the preliminary selection methods, and the track and field and basketball preliminary selections will not be held until the middle of next month. This leaves only half a month for practice before the conference. According to news from Tokyo and Manila, Japan began its selections last autumn. For example, the basketball team has already had several joint training sessions, and swimming and track and field have long been decided, with discussions to conclude everything by the end of this month. Only baseball is still awaiting preliminary selection. In the Philippines, the selection competitions were completed on the 3rd of last month, and swimming athletes and others have been decided. Looking back at China, there is a great sense of lagging behind. The communications from the two places are compiled below for the reference of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Track and Field Strength in the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Manila Communication) The Far Eastern Games, which are attracting attention due to the "Manchukuo" participation issue, are approaching closer to the date. It is only two months away now. The conference is currently being actively prepared, and various countries are also actively preparing to participate. There is no doubt that Japan will win the track and field championship, so Japanese athletes do not seem as concerned about the Far Eastern Games as Filipino athletes. The Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, since holding the national preliminary selection on February 3rd and 4th at the Jose Rizal Memorial Stadium (i.e., the Far Eastern Games venue), has officially selected Filipino track and field athletes, who have already begun training. Based on the recent performances of Filipino athletes over the past month, their strength is still far from the Japanese. However, the conference date is still two months away, so it is possible to produce excellent records in these two months. The recent records of Filipino athletes can give an idea of the performance of Filipino track and field athletes at the time of the conference.</p>
<h3>(1) Sprints</h3>
<p>100 Meters Fantabila 10.6 Seconds</p>
<p>200 Meters Colis 22 Seconds</p>
<p>Regarding sprints, Shin Saga, who is well-known in the Far East, and Nepal Mocesino have given up their athletic lives, and their magnificent figures will no longer be seen at the Far Eastern Games. The recent sprint circles in the Philippines are mostly young people and those who have never been known before. They include Salusete (student at Santo Tomas University) with a time of 11 seconds in the 100 meters and 22.6 seconds in the 200 meters, Colis Haru (student at the University of the Philippines) with a time of exactly 22 seconds in the 200 meters, Libera (student at Santo Tomas University) with a time of 11.1 seconds in the 100 meters, Tirio (student at Santo Tomas University) with a time of 10.8 seconds in the 100 meters, and Fantabila (student at the University of the Philippines) with a time of 22.6 seconds in the 200 meters. There are also middle school students Tirio Curo and Puna Chic. Tirio has a time of 11.4 seconds in the 100 meters and 23 seconds in the 200 meters, and Puna has a time of 11 seconds in the 100 meters and 23 seconds in the 200 meters.</p>
<p>Among the various sprint athletes, Salusete is the most promising. He is relatively confident and often runs within 11.2 seconds. Fantabila recently achieved 10.6 seconds in practice. Libera achieved 11 seconds in the 100 meters in the three-university competition (University of the Philippines, Santo Tomas University, and University of the East) in late January. He was already known as a student and has been able to show his speed since entering the University of the Philippines. His 100-meter time is also within 11 seconds.</p>
<p>Although the above athletes are newcomers, Filipinos have a traditional strength in sprints in the Far East. The Japanese Yoshioka, Sasaki, and Nishi Sadaichi will also have to cope with difficulties. As for whether the Philippines will use the veterans Shin Saga and Nepal Mocesino, it has not yet been decided. As for China's Liu Changchun, unless he has a time of 10.5 or 10.6 seconds in the 100 meters, he will not be able to score points. The hopes are even less in the 200 meters, because the Japanese Yoshioka and Sasaki both have times of 21.2 seconds in the 200 meters, and Nishi Sadaichi's time is 21.3 seconds.</p>
<h3>(2) 400 Meters</h3>
<p>Rock - 51.8 Seconds</p>
<p>In the 400 meters, the Filipino lineup is entirely composed of veterans. They include Aranpura (University of the Philippines), Estrada (University of the Philippines), Rock (Army), and White (Army). White and Aranpura are both skilled in hurdles. Estrada has lost his former courage and failed in the national preliminary selection. Rock won the championship with a record of only 51.8 seconds. In the three-university competition, Garanwa (University of the Philippines) had a time of 51.9 seconds. In addition, there are middle school student Magaharu with a time of 52.4 seconds (second in the national preliminary selection) and Malaha (University of the Philippines) with a time of 52.6 seconds (third in the national preliminary selection) who have strength in the 52-second range. Zirueda, an athlete from the Xavier University, has a strength of 52.3 seconds, but he finished fourth in the national preliminary selection because he failed to participate in the 200-meter preliminary round first (achieving a time of 22.6 seconds), which led to his failure in the 400-meter final. White is old. His time in the 400 meters was exactly 50 seconds and his time in the 400-meter hurdles was 54.8 seconds in the previous year. Now he can no longer reach his peak.</p>
<h3>(3) Middle Distance</h3>
<p>800 Meters Adar 1 Minute 59.4 Seconds</p>
<p>1500 Meters Adar 4 Minutes 10.8 Seconds</p>
<p>Filipino athlete Adar in the middle distance is the most promising veteran in the Philippines and poses a threat to the Japanese. In the last Far Eastern Games, his 800-meter time was equal to the Japanese national record. Recently, his performance has not diminished. His 800-meter time is 2 minutes 1.6 seconds, and his 1500-meter time is 4 minutes 11.3 seconds, both setting new Philippine records. Furthermore, ten days after the national preliminary selection, he achieved a masterpiece of 1 minute 59.4 seconds in the 800 meters and 4 minutes 10.8 seconds in the 1500 meters. Adar is very likely to score points in the Far Eastern track and field competition. In addition, Ramba, Antes, Nut, and Xiu Ke all have times around 2 minutes 2 seconds. Nut and Antes Justine have times around 4 minutes 15 seconds in the 1500 meters. Esnobisa (University of the Philippines), the first in the 10,000 meters in the national preliminary selection, had a terrible time of 35 minutes 32.2 seconds.</p>
<h3>(4) Hurdles</h3>
<p>High Hurdles Garcia 15 Seconds</p>
<p>Middle Hurdles Aranpura 54.8 Seconds</p>
<p>The most threatening sport to the Japanese is hurdles, because the Filipino lineup for this event is particularly complete. Garcia (Army), who achieved a time of 15 seconds last year, has regressed to 15.8 seconds this year, but in the national preliminary selection, he passed the preliminary round with 15.2 seconds and then won the championship with 15 seconds. It is expected that he may be able to defeat the Japanese Shimizu, Murakami, and Fukui in the Far Eastern Games. There are also many talented Filipinos in the middle hurdles. Aranpura's time is 54.8 seconds, White's time is 55.6 seconds, Garcia's time is 56.8 seconds, and Roa's (Min Guo University) time is 58.2 seconds.</p>
<p>In the national preliminary selection, White defeated Aranpura. Both of their strengths may be able to defeat the Japanese Rikuo and Fukui.</p>
<h3>(5) High Jump</h3>
<p>Berrank 1.85 Meters</p>
<p>It's a Pity That Tolibewa Retired</p>
<p>The biggest loss for the Philippines in the field events is the retirement of Toribea. Mr. Toribea once held the Far Eastern record with a time of two meters and also ranked third in the last World Games. After attending the World Games, Toribea obtained American citizenship and studied at the University of Southern California. He returned to the Philippines for some reason last year and lived in seclusion in the village of Taguloob, far from Manila. From then on, he has not attended any more sports meets. In the national preliminary selection, Berrank won the championship with 1.85 meters. Mr. Berrank was originally a student studying in the United States and is now the principal of Hasperu Elementary School.</p>
<p>Because Toribea did not attend the Far Eastern Games, not only will the Philippines not be able to score points in the high jump, but it will also detract from the Games. In addition, Hasgiaru of the University of the Philippines has a time of 1.80 meters, which is unlikely to help.</p>
<h3>(6) Long Jump</h3>
<p>Very Few Jumped Over Seven Meters</p>
<p>Labaro 6.74 Meters</p>
<p>The long jump is even more desolate in the Philippines. Very few people jump over seven meters, and even if they do, it's only once or twice by chance. In the national preliminary selection, Labaro (Siliman University) achieved 6.74 meters. Others such as Hasgiaru (University of the Philippines) and Garino (Army) both have strengths above 6.50 meters. In addition, Filipino long jump star Maru Chinianzhi once had a time of 6.89 meters, but he was unable to compete in the national preliminary selection due to a foot injury.</p>
<h3>(7) Pole Vault</h3>
<p>Szhige 3.67 Meters</p>
<p>In the pole vault, the only person is Szhige of the Army, whose time is 3.67 meters. This is not as good as China and even more difficult to compete against the Japanese athletes in the four-meter range. Next, there is Szwarute (University of Santo Tomas) with a time of 3.45 meters.</p>
<h3>(8) Triple Jump</h3>
<p>Naranbaro 14.65 Meters</p>
<p>In the triple jump, Eba Jielisda (University of the Philippines) once had a time of 14.56 meters a few years ago, and there are high hopes for this year's Games, but he did not attend the national preliminary selection. The first place in the national preliminary selection was Basqiulo, who won first place with 14.37 meters. The second place was a middle school student Naranbaro. Mr. Naranbaro's time has recently advanced to 14.65 meters, which is quite amazing. In the future, he may be selected for the Games.</p>
<h3>(9) Throws</h3>
<p>Discus Amachi 38.25 Meters</p>
<p>Shot Put Feike 12.21 Meters</p>
<p>Javelin Basguru 53.01 Meters</p>
<p>The strength of the Philippines in throwing events is even weaker. Among the three events of shot put, discus, and javelin, only Amachi (Achjie School)'s discus throw is promising, with a time of 38.25 meters, but unless they throw more than 40 meters, they will not be able to score points in the Far East. Feiliao (University of the Philippines)'s time in the shot put is 12.21 meters, and Basguru (Army)'s time in the javelin is 53.01 meters, both of which are very immature.</p>
<h3>Overview of Japanese Preliminary Selections</h3>
<p>(1) Track and Field</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) When Japan held the Meiji Shrine Games last autumn, it selected 77 track and field athletes as candidates to attend the Far Eastern Games.

<h3>Liu Changchun Joins Wuxi Team in Match Against Baihong in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Match Postponed Due to Rain</p>
<p>Competition Expected Today After Weather Clears</p>
<p>Wuxi Express - The Shanghai Baihong Track and Field Team was originally scheduled to come to Wuxi on the 10th of this month to hold a match against local athletes at the Sheqiao Provincial People's Education Institute training ground. The Wuxi sports community, including Xue Huidong, specially organized a preparatory committee to welcome the Baihong team. For the preparation of local athletes, a preliminary competition was held at the Ximen Public Sports Ground on the 4th of this month. The preparatory committee reserved 19 rooms in the Railway Hotel in advance to accommodate the Baihong team members. A reception hall was set up in the lobby, and a white bamboo cloth banner with the words "Welcome Baihong Track and Field Athletes to Wuxi" was hung at the railway station. The Baihong team members, including Fu Baolu, a total of 22 people, arrived in Wuxi on the 2:40 PM express train from Shanghai on the 10th. Due to the train delay, they arrived at the station at 6:00 PM. The Wuxi sports community welcomed them at the station, and Xue Huidong led them to rest at the Railway Hotel. Li Yanxiang, a member of the Jiangnan team, also came to Wuxi on the same train as the Baihong team to join the Wuxi team in the match against Baihong. To ensure a strong performance, Baihong brought all sports equipment such as javelins, iron balls, and vaulting poles. Jin Zhongkang, a famous long-distance runner from Changzhou, also arrived yesterday. Zhang Jiawei, a famous long jumper in Wuxi, has been slightly ill recently, but he has agreed to compete despite his illness. After the Baihong team members arrived at the Railway Hotel, they sat around a table in the lobby for a tea party. At the same time, Liu Changchun, a national sprint star, also traveled from Peiping to Shanghai to participate in the Far Eastern Games. At 9:20 PM, his train passed through Wuxi. Xue Huidong sent Fu Baolu, Xi Jipu, and Xue Chucai as representatives of the Wuxi people to the train to invite Liu Changchun to disembark and join the Wuxi team to compete against Baihong in the 100-meter and 200-meter races. Yesterday (11th) at 1:00 PM was the scheduled time for the competition, but unfortunately, the weather was unfavorable with continuous rain, so the match could not be held. As soon as the weather clears, the match will be held. It is expected that the audience will be enthusiastic, so tickets will be sold to limit the number of spectators.

<p>The Education and Construction Cooperation Design Committee, organized by the Anhui Education and Construction Departments, has submitted a detailed plan for the production of education, which has been reported to the Provincial Government and forwarded to the Three Provinces Suppression Headquarters for record. It is now learned that the committee has also decided to have the Education Department establish vocational schools for tea and silk. Qimen, Zhide, Fuliang, and other places in Anhui Province are famous for tea production and are known as Qizhuang. It is planned to establish a junior tea vocational school in the Tea Improvement Farm originally established by the Qimen County government. It is also planned to establish a high and junior sericulture vocational school in the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Farm and Women's Vocational School in the provincial capital. Guichi, Qingyang, and other counties are the most famous silk-producing areas. These two counties are close to the provincial capital, so the school is planned to be located in the provincial capital. It is also planned to send tea specialists to tea-producing areas in Japan and India for on-site inspections for reference. It is reported that the Provincial Government has submitted this proposal for discussion at a meeting.</p>

<h3>Charlatan Medicine Imported From Abroad</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>There are charlatan doctors, and there are charlatan medicines.</p>
<p>The government should inspect foreign doctors and drugs.</p>
<p>Allowing them to practice in China is an obstacle to our medical community.</p>
<p>We should not be influenced by foreign psychology, and strict inspections are necessary.</p>
<p>People today always say, "imported goods." Imported goods are not just foreign goods! Foreign people are also the same. The Chinese people worship foreign people and take foreign goods without end. This saying of "imported goods" is the popular phrase of today. This phenomenon is expressed completely at all times and in all places, especially in the medical field, which greatly and severely hinders the progress of the new medical community in our country. It must be known that foreign people are of mixed quality, and foreign goods are of varying quality. We should respect and emulate those who are good, but we should not blindly worship and take those who are bad without distinction. Is this not so-called blind worship of foreigners? There are charlatan doctors and charlatan medicines. Not all foreign doctors coming to China and foreign medicines coming to China are charlatans, but charlatans account for half of them. It has been observed that foreign doctors come to China because they have no status in their own country, so they have to take China as their only way out, and most of the foreign medicines coming to China are purely for profit, taking China as their only sales market. Then, their purpose in coming to China can be said to be completely out of the ambition of economic aggression. On the one hand, due to the Chinese people's psychology of worshipping foreigners, their status is high, and on the other hand, due to the introduction of patients by our new medical community and the promotion of medicines by new drug merchants, their business is booming. Although, their desires are not yet satisfied, and they are using the means of insinuation and using our country's comprador class to alienate and eliminate society's feelings for our new medical community and its faith in the new pharmaceutical industry. Their psychology of hostility towards our new medical community is obvious, and their obstacle is not a hundred times greater than that of old medicine?</p>
<p>In recent years, our people's remarks have focused more on the criticism of old medicine and the internal rectification of the new medical community, so the disreputable people in the new medicine have also revealed their charlatan behavior in order to shift social attention. Only for foreign charlatan doctors and foreign charlatan medicines, we have not yet been able to fully expose their treachery for the people to see and know together. It is necessary to know that the charlatan skills of domestic charlatan doctors are limited. People with knowledge can see their treachery at a glance. The so-called can only deceive people for a while, and eventually it is difficult to escape the clear judgment of society. As for foreign charlatan medicine, it is not the same. They have a strong government as their backing, and they have strong capital for their display. And there are those who work for them. For this reason, the Chinese people are more skeptical of domestic new medicine and domestic new drugs, and only worship those from abroad, falling into the trap and unable to extricate themselves. As for whether their origin is proper, whether their academics are brilliant, and whether their medicines are excellent, they have no time to ask. Is not their charlatan skill extremely brilliant?</p>
<p>From the perspective of professional interests, foreign doctors and foreign medicines that have not been formally inspected by our government have no right to practice and promote in China. This can be believed by referring to the handling of foreign medicine in various countries. It must be known that academics are the public property of the world, although it cannot be privately owned by one country, and professional jobs are related to the lives of the people, and there is a need to protect them. Therefore, for those foreign doctors who come to China, if we can select the best of the best and give them the position of professor, it may be a small supplement to the famine of domestic academics. If we allow them to practice without any restrictions, their obstacles to our medical community cannot be overstated. Although our party members do not have the power to manipulate political orders, they have the responsibility to offer opinions. If we can use this purpose to criticize foreign charlatan doctors and foreign charlatan medicines with true evidence, on the one hand, to awaken the people's psychology of worshipping foreigners, and on the other hand, to eliminate the obstacles of our new medical community, it may also be the obligation that our people should fulfill to the society and to the profession. My party members, come on!</p>
<h3>The Efficacy of Artificial Pneumothorax for Pulmonary Disease</h3>
<p>— Liu Qijing</p>
<p>(I) Introduction: Civilized nations globally spare no effort in treating and preventing tuberculosis, recognizing it as a challenging issue impacting national economies and people's livelihoods. Consequently, the mortality rate from pulmonary diseases in Europe, America, and Japan has steadily decreased annually. Looking back at our country, policymakers lack long-term vision, and the public's knowledge of pulmonary disease remains rudimentary. This has led to a wider spread of the disease and an increase in annual deaths. Among those with some knowledge, they understand the severity of pulmonary disease, trust the advice of modern medicine, and adhere to hygiene, climate, diet, and medication therapies, hoping for a cure. However, this requires prolonged rest and significant financial expenditure, resulting in substantial losses for individuals and society. Therefore, in our country's environment, modern doctors must devise safe methods for treating and preventing pulmonary disease for the sake of society and the people's livelihood. What is this method? It is artificial pneumothorax.</p>
<p>Only 11% of open pulmonary diseases (i.e., those where pulmonary tuberculosis bacteria can be detected in sputum) are converted to closed cases using traditional treatments. However, with artificial pneumothorax, this can reach 36%. This is the preventive effect of artificial pneumothorax. Previously, hygiene, climate, diet, and medication were considered the golden rules for treating pulmonary disease, with long periods of rest as a necessary condition. What about the economic losses and reduced work capacity? With artificial pneumothorax, recovery is comparatively faster. The cure rate for pulmonary tuberculosis used to be 12%, but with artificial pneumothorax, it can increase to 40%. This is the therapeutic effect of artificial pneumothorax. The efficacy of artificial pneumothorax is evident. Therefore, I am introducing it to the readers.</p>
<p>(II) Overview of Artificial Pneumothorax: The inner surface of our chest wall and the outer surface of the lungs are covered by the pleura. The pleura is like a sac with a space inside, which is the pleural cavity. The pressure inside the cavity is negative. By introducing a certain amount of air into this cavity, we create a lower negative pressure or a very slight positive pressure. As a result, the lungs collapse to a certain extent, which can have a significant effect on pulmonary disease. This is artificial pneumothorax. Performing artificial pneumothorax requires specialized equipment, consisting of two main parts: (1) a device for measuring the pressure in the pleural cavity; (2) a device for introducing gas. The artificial pneumothorax procedure is simple and can be performed under local anesthesia. Therefore, the pain and risk are minimal.</p>
<p>(III) Clinical Action and Effects of Artificial Pneumothorax: The pressure in the pleural cavity is negative, so the lungs remain in a state of tension within the chest cavity. As a result, cavities, abscesses, and areas of tissue destruction within the lungs cannot shrink and become quiescent, which adversely affects healing. With artificial pneumothorax, a certain amount of air is introduced into the pleural cavity, creating a lower negative pressure or a slightly positive pressure. Then the lungs shrink, reducing tension, and the lungs' respiratory movements decrease or disappear. Thus, the lungs can become quiescent, which is the most important condition for turning the tide in the treatment of pulmonary disease. In clinical practice, after performing artificial pneumothorax on patients with pulmonary disease within a feasible range, the significant effects are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Reduction of Fever: Clinically, there is often a subtle fever that feels hot to the touch. Artificial pneumothorax can rapidly or gradually reduce this fever.</p>
<p>(2) Regression of Tuberculosis Toxicity Symptoms (night sweats, headache, palpitations, loss of appetite, weight loss, etc.): After creating pneumothorax, night sweats and headaches can disappear. Sleep improves, appetite and weight increase, and menstruation may return.</p>
<p>(3) Relief of Breathing Difficulty: In the initial stage of pneumothorax creation, breathing difficulty may occur due to the reduced respiratory surface in the lungs. Later, due to the enhanced compensatory function of the other lung, the degree of difficulty gradually decreases compared to before pneumothorax creation, eventually disappearing.</p>
<p>(4) Improved Cardiac Nutrition: Due to the reduction in fever and general symptoms, the nutrition of the heart muscle can be restored. As a result, the nature of the pulse turns for the better.</p>
<p>After creating artificial pneumothorax, the affected lung is in a collapsed state. The cessation of lymphatic flow in the lung is a natural consequence. Tuberculosis bacteria produce a toxin in the lung, causing tuberculosis toxicity symptoms that greatly deplete the body's strength. Now, due to the cessation of lymphatic flow in the affected area, the toxin is confined and retained in a part, not entering the bloodstream and not causing tuberculosis toxicity symptoms. Therefore, the effects in items (1) to (4) must be attributed to this.</p>
<p>(5) Relief or Disappearance of Cough and Sputum: Due to the purely mechanical action of lung collapse, cavities and airways shrink and narrow. Therefore, it is natural that the amount of cough, sputum, and tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum increases for several days after pneumothorax creation. Thereafter, the amount of sputum decreases, and its nature gradually changes from purulent to mucopurulent and then to purely mucous, eventually leading to no sputum. Tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum decrease simultaneously with the amount of sputum, eventually leading to no bacteria. It can be seen that artificial pneumothorax is a very beneficial procedure in the prevention of pulmonary disease.</p>
<p>(6) Cessation of Pulmonary Hemorrhage: Artificial pneumothorax is a direct life-saving treatment for pulmonary hemorrhage. Lung collapse, compression, quiescence, and cavity shrinkage all have excellent hemostatic effects. The effect is even more significant for cavitary bleeding, which is the most difficult to stop.</p>
<p>The effects described above refer to complete pneumothorax. Complete pneumothorax means that the lung is reduced to a considerable volume at the hilum due to artificial pneumothorax. Therefore, when the lung pleura and chest wall pleura are adhered, the appropriate pressure of artificial pneumothorax cannot separate these two parts, and the various parts of the lung cannot shrink evenly. This is called incomplete pneumothorax. The results of incomplete pneumothorax are different from those of complete pneumothorax. Even in terms of hemostatic effect, if the bleeding is located in the area of adhesion, and this area cannot be detached by artificial pneumothorax and collapsed, then the hemostatic effect will naturally not be achieved.</p>
<h3>After Reading the "Draft of Shanghai Medical Association's Consultation Fee Regulations"</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association, based on a proposal for formulating consultation fee regulations previously established by the General Assembly, "recently drafted a complete set of minimum consultation fee regulations by Dr. Song Guobin, printed it in a small booklet, and distributed it to members to solicit opinions. On the one hand, this matter is a necessary task to maintain the rights of formal physicians, which should be jointly regulated by their own professional organization; on the other hand, it is also a noteworthy matter for society. No one can say that they will never get sick and have no relationship with doctors. The various bad habits of previous owing consultation fees and deliberately reducing payment of consultation fees must be eliminated; furthermore, whether the entire draft is a minimum rate that middle-class people can afford, these issues are all under research and discussion. Therefore, I feel that this matter should be known to every household in general society. It should not be that the regulations are only regulations, and the bad habits are still bad habits, like "the mythical mountain on the sea that can be seen but not reached," ultimately becoming mere words on paper.</p>
<p>Whether this draft is a minimum rate? Whether it can be afforded by the middle class? These two questions will be discussed later. In the original draft, there are eight principles, which I think all members of society need to read. Now, let's copy them below:</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>(1) All physicians of this association have the right to receive consultation fees.</p>
<p>(2) Except for the poor and sick, this association, considering the current living standards in this city, has formulated the following minimum consultation fee standards to suit the general middle-class population.</p>
<p>(3) All members of this association shall not formulate consultation examples that are below the publicly agreed limit and engage in unethical competition.</p>
<p>(4) Due to the ever-changing nature of illnesses, "package deals" are prohibited.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to ordinary consultations, special examinations or treatments requiring instruments shall be charged double.</p>
<p>(6) During consultations, the consultation fee for the consulting physician shall be higher than the consultation fee for the regular physician.</p>
<p>(7) For patients who repeatedly owe consultation fees, requests for consultation may be declined.</p>
<p>These principles are, of course, necessary to be publicly established in order to maintain the minimum consultation fee rights of the physicians themselves. We know that in the current society, the way patients treat physicians is very complicated. The facts of repeatedly owing consultation fees and deliberately not paying or reducing payment are very numerous; there are also cases where the consultation fees are not paid because the patient has passed away; sometimes, the physician only consulted a few times initially, and then another physician provided treatment, but they also suffer losses due to non-payment of consultation fees; there are even cases where physicians are accused of negligence for demanding overdue consultation fees. Even if the court makes a fair judgment, their social status and reputation will inevitably be affected to some extent. In such cases, I think every physician, even if they have not personally experienced it, must have heard of many examples! But on the other hand, most non-formal doctors, those who failed to learn writing and failed to learn swordsmanship, use the lowest prices, calling themselves charitable, advertising themselves as experts in leukorrhea or tuberculosis, and using the term "package deal" as a tool to deceive patients. When an acute illness occurs, as long as the patient believes it is very dangerous, they can take this opportunity to demand huge amounts of money in addition to the consultation fee. The fees charged for some very common surgeries are probably more than ten or twenty times what is stipulated in this draft! As far as I know, there is a leukorrhea specialist doctor whose consultation fee is only one yuan, but each time, including buying medicine, it costs almost fifteen yuan or more; it is conceivable that no major surgery is involved. It goes without saying that this kind of price cannot be afforded by the general middle class! Therefore, this draft, of course, protects the inherent rights of physicians themselves; even general patients can read it and understand the minimum compensation for the labor of physicians. I think it is also a small way to prevent all kinds of colorful scams from being used.</p>
<p>Furthermore, assuming that this draft reaches the hands of the general public, what kind of opinions will they have? This question is certainly worth raising. My prediction is: Those who can fully understand the current society will certainly not slander it; but this is the smallest minority. The other majority probably don't understand it very well. They feel that doctors treating illnesses is a charitable act, and the amount of the consultation fee cannot be haggled over; putting it in writing is already excessive, and now there is even a regulation that consultation examples must not be set below the publicly agreed limit, and their behavior is similar to that of merchants. This kind of viewpoint uses traditional Chinese ethics to restrict individuals, completely failing to recognize the entire situation of the real society. Ordinary physicians always have a clause that the poor and sick are not counted, and this cannot be enjoyed by non-poor classes. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to think of it as a charitable act. I personally have another feeling about their views. Anyone who lives in the current society, of course, must solve their minimum needs for food and clothing; and of course, money is essential for this. But I think Westerners are clear about wanting money; only the Chinese character is most afraid of being said to want money, even if they want it very much in their bones, they never easily express it in words. Wang Yifu of the Jin Dynasty did not speak of money, which is a very clear precedent. Later, painters and calligraphers had self-determined prices, and Zheng Banqiao of the Qing Dynasty even had bold statements such as "It is always better to give silver than to give gifts or food;" and "Buying on credit is especially likely to be refused payment;" but people generally feel that this is the elegance of a famous person, which can only be done once and cannot be imitated by others. Even now, this kind of "legacy" is still preserved to some extent in the minds of the general public. For the profession of physician, shocked by the old saying that medicine is a benevolent art and a good minister is a good doctor, they always feel that it is somewhat different from merchants and should not only see profit, and haggle over amounts. They don't know that we are ultimately individuals, and also individuals in the real society. We cannot "jump out of the three realms and not be in the five elements;" nor are we "not contaminated by the smoke and fire of the human world." Therefore, I predict that most people will misunderstand this draft. But we certainly cannot take into account this kind of view that does not recognize the real society. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Gonococci (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yangao</p>
<p>In the last section of this talk, the author wants to talk about the immune status (i.e., resistance) of the body that develops gonorrhea. As mentioned above, gonorrhea is a disease unique to humans, and other animals do not develop this disease (except for a few times when it was artificially transmitted to animals). Therefore, many scholars believe that there is ultimately some kind of resistance to gonococci within the bodies of animals. This idea is not without evidence. For example, when we artificially culture this bacterium, human serum is definitely better than any other animal serum as a nutrient. Then this human serum is indeed a good food for gonococci. At the same time, the human body is particularly susceptible to these gonococci. However, each part, gender, and age show different changes. The vulva of young children is very easy to be infected with this bacterium, while elderly people without disease cannot be infected with this disease. On the same body, the mucous membrane of the eye is less susceptible to infection than the mucous membrane of the urethra (referring to adults), but the conjunctiva of young children is indeed very easy to be infected with this disease. This kind of rule can also be changed according to external conditions. In summary, we can say that the human body does not have any definite "natural immunity" to reject the invasion of this gonorrhea.</p>
<p>In addition to this natural immunity, we also think about whether, after a person has had gonorrhea once, it is the same as other kinds of problems and can resist the second infection (such as typhoid fever, smallpox, etc.). The answer to this question of "post-disease immunity" is not certain. Although people who have had gonorrhea can prove that their suffering is much less during the second illness than during the first one, science has not yet determined that this situation is a post-disease immunity (some people think it is a kind of local immunity, but when viewed from the perspective of strength, even if it is really a "local immunity," then it is also very weak. Therefore, some people still think that it is just a greater habituation only). Because, after all, it cannot be avoided, the occurrence of a second illness. Therefore, artificially manufactured vaccines, of course, do not have much preventive ability, this so-called "artificial immunity" (the cholera vaccine injection in summer also belongs to this). In today's practical aspects, it definitely occupies an important value, that is, its therapeutic effect. After all, is this effect entirely an immune one, or is it an ordinary stimulation therapy? Although there is no definite theory on this issue, the author definitely believes that it has the above two kinds of effects. As for artificial vaccines (that is, the injection liquid made after killing gonococci), and live gonococci, what kind of resistance occurs inside the body, this is because it belongs to something that is too specialized, and the author should not say more. However, we can definitely use the reactions discovered by this kind of resistance effect (gonorrhea serum reaction) to diagnose gonorrhea (referring to chronic and recurrent cases). Today, it has been approved by several experts, but we must also seek the assistance of clinicians at the same time in order to achieve a bird's-eye view of the overall diagnosis (treatment experiences, observation of disease manifestations, and other examination results throughout history, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition to various therapeutic drugs, there is also the production of gonorrhea serum for gonorrhea. Although its therapeutic efficiency is not something that this talk should discuss, in terms of immunological theory, it belongs to "passive immunity," which is a completely opposite type of immune distinction to the various "automatic immunities" mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Brief Introduction to Febrile Diseases (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shen Kangbai</p>
<p>It is very easy for us to measure body temperature. We only need to strictly disinfect the thermometer and insert it under the patient's tongue, or in the armpit, anus, etc., to determine the height of the fever. However, the temperature of the anus is usually higher than that in the mouth, and the temperature of the armpit is slightly lower than that in the mouth. Also, temperature measurement after a meal is often higher than usual by half a degree or more, which must also be known. A body temperature rising from 37.5 to 38 degrees is called slight fever. 38 to 38.5 degrees is called mild fever. 38.5 to 39.5 degrees is called moderate fever. 39.5 to 40.5 degrees is called high fever. Above 40.5 degrees is called extreme fever. Above 42 degrees is called deadly fever. Fever occurs to resist pathogens, so mild fever can be tolerated. There is no need to randomly use antipyretic agents, etc. However, prolonged high fever, lingering and not receding, greatly impairs blood circulation, nerves, digestion, respiration, excretion, and other organs, and abnormal changes also occur in tissues. The pathological changes of each organ are listed below.</p>
<p>(1) Blood Circulation Disorder: It is caused by increased body temperature and viruses. In addition, the vagus nerve is also abnormally excited, and the pulse is frequent, often showing a repeated pulse. Heart strength and blood pressure are erratic. Generally, the pulse is large and strong in the initial stage. If it reaches the final stage, the heart strength and blood pressure decrease, and the pulse is small, weak, and soft.</p>
<p>(2) Nerve Disorder: After the body temperature increases, the toxins produced by the pathogens in the body stimulate the nerves, resulting in mental anxiety, general fatigue, headache, dizziness, or sensory sensitivity, or restless sleep, or delirium, or a state of excitement. Children also have convulsions. The higher the body temperature, the more severe the nerve disorder.</p>
<p>(3) Digestive Disorder: After the body temperature increases, the amount of various digestive juices and the stomach's digestive power decrease, resulting in indigestion, tongue coating, constipation, taste abnormalities, dry mouth, and sensitive gastric mucosa, often causing vomiting. In addition to increased body temperature, these digestive disorders are also greatly related to the effects of toxins.</p>
<p>(4) Respiratory Disorder: The most obvious is rapid breathing, which is caused by the increase in blood temperature and is parallel to the height of the fever.</p>
<p>(5) Excretory Disorder: Urine volume decreases, the color is dark, and the specific gravity is high, often containing uric acid and urate deposits. During extreme fever, urine often contains protein and acetone, etc. Urea often increases to more than two or three times the normal amount. Salt decreases. The excretion of water and carbon dioxide from the skin increases. The secretion of sweat is absent in the extreme stage, but increases during the resolution period.</p>
<p>(6) Tissue Changes: The pulse and muscles are turbid, swollen, or exhibit fatty degeneration. Red blood cells are destroyed and decreased. The combustion of tissue components is enhanced. Due to nutritional disorders, inflammatory diseases and gangrene are easily caused.</p>
<p>Mild fever is often easy to treat. Severe fever is very difficult to treat. High fever lingers and does not stop. Various organs are damaged. Gradually, due to heart failure from high fever, death occurs. (End)</p>
<h3>The Truth of Lung Disease Cured by Kerosene</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The fact that lung disease is cured by drinking kerosene has been successively discovered in various places. Someone originally wanted to commit suicide by drinking kerosene, but unexpectedly cured his lung disease; also, a certain local committee member also tried drinking it, and the results were indeed good, etc. The era of drinking kerosene, which previously belonged to folk remedies, is now a thing of the past. According to current reports, formal physicians are having patients try taking it, and it can not only cure lung disease, but also cure severe cases of laryngeal tuberculosis, hemorrhoids, spinal osteomyelitis, and other tuberculous diseases. Furthermore, diabetes and asthma can also be cured.</p>
<p>Japan is also a world-renowned tuberculosis country, with no less than 110,000 to 120,000 people sacrificed to tubercle bacilli every year. Although its medical science is said to be progressing year by year, and medical institutions are becoming more complete day by day, the number of tuberculosis patients still increases with the increase in population.</p>
<p>Since Dr. Koch of Germany discovered the tubercle bacillus, scholars around the world have published many leaflets and made countless attempts to eradicate the tubercle bacillus. However, to this day, they have still failed to invent a harmless and effective miracle drug. In the end, lung disease is considered incurable by medicine, and only rest, relocation, nutrition, and natural therapy are the final treatment methods available. Today, the majority of doctors advocate natural therapy.</p>
<p>Is there really no miracle drug to cure lung disease on this earth? Isn't it the most interesting thing in life to excavate a treasure deeply buried in the ground?</p>
<p>Kerosene, which has always been regarded as fuel, has now become a safe beverage and the best miracle drug to eradicate tubercle bacilli, which is truly unexpected!</p>
<p>Dr. Torakazu Hayami, Doctor of Science Yoshitora Iwamoto, Bachelor of Medicine Matsuo, Mr. Satao Kimura, Mr. Seiji Kinoshita, Mr. Masayoshi Chiba, and many other physicians and chemists, either through clinical practice, animal experiments, or physico-chemical experiments such as X-rays, or analytical chemistry experiments of kerosene, each share the research. On the other hand, large groups of personnel and workers from Kawasaki Shipbuilding and Kobe Steel Works are conducting large-scale controlled trials, with thousands of experimental cases seen throughout Japan.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Tokyo Shufu no Tomo magazine went to interview the aforementioned specialist doctors and scholars, asking them to publicly announce their valuable research, and also visited the health associations of the Kawasaki and Kobe steel plants and other places, listening to the conversations of those who had experimented with it. Now, the original story is recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) The results of kerosene therapy, which is effective for almost everyone who tries it (only one person among hundreds of experimenters had poor results)</p>
<p>According to the report of Dr. Torakazu Hayami, Director of the Hyogo Prefectural Children's Research Institute in Japan: When I heard that kerosene can cure lung disease, I was very interested. Because I know that kerosene is used as an emulsion and is a powerful bactericide, and it is harmless to drink. Judging from various facts, I thought this might be a very powerful discovery.</p>
<p>I have heard that among Russians and Eskimos, people have used kerosene to replace alcohol since ancient times. I have also heard that a wealthy family in Okayama Prefecture, Japan, fell into decline and could not afford to buy alcohol, so they tried drinking kerosene, and their health greatly improved, living to be over 100 years old. I have also heard that at the kerosene company in Kudamatsu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, none of the workers in the factory have lung disease, and office staff who have lung disease also recover after working in the factory. Therefore, I immediately wanted to try it myself to see if there were any side effects.</p>
<p>Although I do not suffer from lung disease, I cough excessively from smoking cigarettes. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I drank 30 watts of kerosene (more than one and a half spoons) each time, drinking it several times. As a result, not only were my stomach, intestines, and kidneys unharmed, but my appetite increased greatly the next day, and the cough stopped completely. Therefore, I know that kerosene is also extremely effective as an expectorant. I also wanted to test the bactericidal power of kerosene, so I put tubercle bacilli into a culture medium and dripped a thin drop of kerosene, and the tubercle bacilli died completely. I am now continuing to experiment on guinea pigs and rabbits, and the results will be announced at a medical conference in due course. I am unable to inform you at this time.</p>
<p>In short, after animal experiments, I am more convinced of its safety and effectiveness. Therefore, whenever I encounter lung disease patients, I advise them to try taking it, and I have obtained many cured cases. Please allow me to describe one or two of them. Mr. A, a teaching assistant at a certain school (27 years old), suffered from lung disease in both lungs. In the past six years, he had tried all kinds of treatments, but his condition only progressed and regressed. He had already resigned himself to the fact that it would be difficult to fully recover. After drinking kerosene, he drank 15 to 20 watts each time, drinking it every two days to one week, for a total of six times, and has recovered to near complete recovery.</p>
<p>Also, a student, Mr. K (22 years old), from a college of commerce was diagnosed by the school doctor and a certain doctor as having apical catarrh, and it was said that water bubble sounds could be heard on both shoulders, front and back. After drinking kerosene only twice, there was only one water bubble sound, and it had shrunk extremely. His vitality also recovered rapidly, and he was completely cured thereafter. Also, a friend of mine suffered from spinal osteomyelitis and only drank kerosene a few times, and this year he was able to go to the beach for bathing. Even the servant at my research institute, who suffered from diabetes, was cured by drinking kerosene.</p>
<p>About several hundred people have obtained good results from the drinking method that I have taught, and the results are close to 100%.</p>
<p>There is only one case of a 48-year-old man with lung disease in both lungs who also developed kidney disease and beriberi. He was extremely weak. After drinking kerosene, he immediately felt refreshed the next day, and his appetite also improved. Just as he was rejoicing, he suddenly died of beriberi attacking his heart. Although the cause is unclear, this is the only regrettable case. All others have achieved gratifying results.</p>
<p>X X X X X X X X</p>
<p>The method of drinking and the amount varies depending on age and physique, etc. Generally, it can be started from about 10 watts, gradually increasing to about 15 watts. It is safer to drink a small amount and increase the number of times. (Drinking 10 watts of kerosene each time is less than half a small wine glass. It is most convenient to measure it with a measuring cup from a pharmacy.)</p>
<p>The time to drink kerosene should be around 9 p.m., you can skip dinner and drink it before going to bed. The second time, drink it again after four or five days. From the third time onwards, drink it every five days to one week.</p>
<p>Kerosene is not difficult to drink, but if you don't drink it on an empty stomach, it may sometimes cause vomiting.</p>
<p>Workers at Kawasaki Shipbuilding have drunk 50 watts at a time without any harm. As for its side effects, what is currently known is that most people have diarrhea after drinking it for the first time, and drinking too much can cause sore throat and hoarseness. However, these are all temporary phenomena and will heal on their own if left alone. Especially after diarrhea, the appetite increases and the spirit is refreshed, which is commonly acknowledged by those who have drunk kerosene. As for the type of kerosene, any type is good, but it seems that kerosene that is not very high-grade is better. Although it is also made from kerosene, such as gasoline, it is harmful to drink and should be absolutely avoided. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Reason</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The West Lake Art Academy exhibition held in Shanghai this time has undoubtedly given a new stimulus to the silent art world. Our magazine has received many criticisms of the exhibition in recent days. Due to space limitations, we have not been able to publish them all. We have selected one article each from those expressing satisfaction and dissatisfaction to show a glimpse of the viewers' opinions. Editor</p>
<p>Two art exhibitions were held in Shanghai in March, one where several private individuals hawked their works, and one from Hangzhou. I visited with a sincere and respectful heart, but returned confused, thinking: I don't want to see this kind of painting. But the few works by Xiao Wuyuan and Qi Baishi were still remarkable, giving people a relatively deep impression.</p>
<p>The matter of art cannot be slandered. Do not say that there are no people in Chinese society, the truth, falsehood, beauty, and ugliness are actually as clear as daylight. Many people know the reason, but do not know how to say it. The greatness of those who have achieved fame is not accidental; the great name of those who are fraudulent can only deceive fools. The former is permanent, the latter can only last for a while. Whether it is the Shanghai School, the Beijing School, Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism, or Objectivism, this principle is correct.</p>
<p>Now we are learning Western painting, and the results are very good. It is something that Chinese painters should admire that there can be such good results in one or two decades, they may not work so hard. This is in terms of learning. However, what about the works? Most of them are dispensable, superficial, and weak in spirit, not knowing what they are saying. Copying or imitating paintings even more makes people feel hypocritical and fraudulent, unbearable!</p>
<p>The reason is that modern China does not understand Western art, and artists understand art even less. Since artists do not understand art, they naturally do not understand the essence and life of art. There is nothing inside the form, no skill or content; there is even less outside the form, no thought, personality, character, or soul. Since there is no legal principle, how can there be Tao; since the form and shadow are not yet complete, how can there be spirit? They cannot be compared to Western European writers from afar, nor can they be compared to Chinese paintings from nearby--this can be considered a very painful thing.</p>
<p>This cannot be blamed on modern young artists, but should be blamed on the instructors, how many geniuses have been taught badly. However, the instructors are not to blame, because the East and the West are so far apart, we have no way to see real Western art. Printing technology and image technology are not developed, and it is difficult to see even copies, so we can only be confused and hazy. Eastern and Western nations, cultures, and traditions are so different that this highest expression of life is difficult to agree with, which is not surprising.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the West Lake Art Academy Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>The Chinese art world suddenly became lively after September 18th, which seems quite unexpected. Taking Shanghai as an example, the exhibitions in recent years are like "bamboo shoots after rain" and "emerging endlessly." This year, as soon as the spring arrived, the 4th Art Exhibition of the National Art Academy began at the Shanghai Sino-French Friendship Association. Spring is lovely, and it is even more grateful to have an art exhibition to see during such a festive season. However, it is probably irrelevant to those who have to work all day.</p>
<p>The art exhibition of the Art Academy this time is truly amazing, just in terms of quantity. Even the floors and stairwells are artistically filled with works. The decorative paintings are what the Art Academy is known for, and everyone admires them, so I don't need to say more. Mr. Lin Fengmian's improved Chinese paintings are truly daring, taking inspiration from Western colors and brushstrokes, which is really like a head-on blow to the so-called "Chinese painters," making them shake their heads and tremble. Also, the chrysanthemums painted by Mr. Sun Fuxi, except for "Why Willing to Lower Your Head," which is "lightly sketched," are all "carefully laid out" and "delicately depicted," which is really much better than his "typical essays." Speaking of oil paintings, "masterpieces" should naturally be said to be particularly numerous. Among them, Mr. Wu Dayu's nudes, portraits, and still lifes make me feel that China is not entirely without painters with pure skill; Ms. Cai William's portrait of her husband, Mr. Lin Wenzheng, is also a very eye-catching work.</p>
<p>It is difficult to please people with words now, so it is better to talk less about the rest of the works. However, here, I would like to make a special mention of a new type of "lacquer painting" discovered in this exhibition. This uses a colored lacquer material to express various images on cloth or board, sometimes even stacking them up, appearing like reliefs. Presumably because the stickiness of the lacquer is particularly strong, it is also particularly powerful to sweep and brush, for example, Mr. Zhu Xianshou's "Road Workers" and Mr. Jiang Hongda's "Galloping Horse" can all arouse people's nervous emotions. I think that although such things are very different from woodcuts in form, their effect may not be as great as woodcuts. I very much hope that the students of the Art Academy will work harder to study lacquer painting: anyone who cares about art may also want to discuss it if they have time. We know that what the great artists despise is often the best art, like woodcuts, which is a very good example.</p>
<p>[P Benefits of Insomnia</p>
<p>— Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>At night, lying in bed, my mind keeps thinking about this and that. Soon after, you realize that something is wrong tonight. You toss and turn, but you still can't fall asleep. So you mutter to yourself, counting one, two, three, four... No, you focus on listening to the ticking of the clock... No. You get up to find a difficult-to-read book. After reading two or three pages, your head feels a little dizzy. You take the opportunity to throw away the book and close your eyes, but soon, you still feel that it is ineffective, as if the old man Somnus has forgotten you tonight. So you get up again and do some indoor gentle exercises, until you are exhausted. You fall back on the bed, but it still doesn't work, it doesn't work!</p>
<p>Alas--you will sigh like this, because you know that you will have insomnia tonight.</p>
<p>But is occasional insomnia a regrettable thing?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>In these tense days, the most common complaint we make is: this world is too big and too complicated. The reason is that all we have is a small brain, and there are too many things we come into contact with and deal with every day, so that our memory and thinking power are not enough to allocate. The result is that we feel that the world is too complicated.</p>
<p>Yes, in daily life, we do mechanical work all day long. It is simply impossible to have some time and opportunity to memorize something or think about something. Do you think that when you return home in the evening, after dinner, light a cigarette, and lie in a comfortable chair, you can have your wish fulfilled? Unless you are exiled on a deserted island, can you guarantee that when you are quietly absorbed in your thoughts, your younger brother, your wife, or your children will definitely not come to disturb your thoughts? And what about those uninvited guests who come to visit, or the cries of those vendors on the street?</p>
<p>Occasional insomnia is the most appropriate remedy that arises in response to the situation. Usually, we fall asleep as soon as we lie on the bed at night, so we see the Duke of Zhou, meet Confucius, or ascend to heaven, or enter hell, or go everywhere. However, it is of no help to one's personal career. Although the ancients had the romantic story of getting a good line in a dream, it is too unreliable. If you sleep soundly without dreaming, although you say that you are full of energy when you wake up the next day, the confusing affairs of the world and the fixed work that must be done every day are still in front of you. At most, we can say that we have more energy to deal with those mechanical tasks, but there is no reason to say that we can have the opportunity to carefully remember and carefully think. Sufficient energy can only give us more energy to work, but it cannot give us the time and opportunity to do more detailed and careful thinking.</p>
<p>If it is insomnia—ah, the opportunity has come. In the middle of the night, everyone, including all things in the world, is asleep. The surroundings are silent. At this time, you are completely undisturbed, and you are the only one who is having insomnia. This is an opportunity worth thanking God for. You can take this time to think about your work, the plan for your career, and the friends you have forgotten in your daily memory. Think about the things you knew you should do but forgot. And in this time, you will temporarily discover many careers and plans that you never thought of. If you are planning something, after a night of insomnia and careful consideration, when you wake up tomorrow, you will be surprised to find how much the harvest of that night of insomnia exceeded your own expectations.</p>
<p>Haven't we often heard or read stories about many famous people in history who achieved success in their careers after several nights of hard thinking? Those "several nights of hard thinking" are insomnia. I dare say that if a writer often has insomnia while writing a book, it will definitely be a better book in the future. Similarly, if a scientist can have the opportunity to have insomnia, he will definitely achieve his research goals in a shorter time.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw an advertisement for a blood tonic in a foreign magazine. It used extra-large characters to label that the reason why the world is not good is because the world is ruled by a group of people who are not healthy. Therefore, it said that if the world is to be good, you must take his blood tonic to make your body strong, and then your mind will be clear, and then the world will be greatly governed.</p>
<p>Although the wording of this advertisement is good, it is inevitably close to humor, as if it is a bit satirical. I think that the reason why the world is not good is because the bodies of the rulers are too well nourished, so that they fall asleep as soon as they lie on the bed at night, and they cannot have insomnia. If they don't go home and sleep, and are full of energy, they will definitely party all night, and there will definitely be no chance of insomnia. Since there is no insomnia, then the world cannot be peaceful, which is to be expected.</p>
<p>The benefits of insomnia are as mentioned above. I say, if you have insomnia every night, you should consult a doctor or take one or two sleeping pills. If you have never had insomnia, then you should choose a Saturday night in a certain month (so it doesn't matter if you get up a little later tomorrow), drink a few more cups of strong coffee, lie in bed early, and wait for "insomnia" to descend on your body. As for being able to automatically have occasional insomnia, then you should directly thank yourself and God.</p>
<p>If everyone can have occasional insomnia, then there will be amazing records of all the progress in the world, and the peace of the world will be just around the corner. If you don't believe me, please try it.</p>
<h3>A Tentative Translation of the Book of Songs</h3>

<p>Jiang You Si</p>
<p>A large river has a rushing backflow. You, the girl who is getting married, give me a cold shoulder. Give me a cold shoulder, maybe you will regret it in the future!</p>
<p>Two, a large river has a shoal like an island. You, the girl who is getting married, make things difficult for me. Make things difficult for me, maybe we will play together in the future!</p>
<p>Three, a large river can accommodate different tributaries. You, the girl who is getting married, ignore me. Ignore me, I can only sing a song to relieve myself!</p>
<h3>Book Talk</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Whenever there is a troubled world, books, like the oppressed people, suffer disasters everywhere. According to Gao Heng (Congpei), when "Zibo City fell during the late Ming Dynasty, firewood and Chu were all poems and books. Muddy puddles were used as shoes, and battles were used as armor" (with Zhou Jianqi), but this phenomenon is not limited to the late Ming Dynasty, but is always the case. Thinking of the difficulty of collecting and searching for a book, it is truly impossible not to sigh when it is consigned to a great disaster. Generally speaking, the enemies of books are nothing more than war, fire, and bookworms. The cruelty of fire to books can be seen in the burning of Jiangyun Tower. The impact of war is exemplified even more. As for bookworms, Deng Rugao (Yuanyue) said: "Bookworms are especially cruel to deceive me, who has been a guest for a long time. They have devoured my collection of books in the West Building without leaving anything behind. Yesterday, I searched for their species and burned them as a family, regretting that I could not exhaust my military might" (with Xu Weihe), which is also an interesting example. Whenever I see old books in old families, which have been infested by bookworms and are incomplete, there is often a regret that I cannot see the complete picture of the work. The psychological phenomenon is similar to what Rugao said.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The impact of war on books, as described by Chen Hongxu (Daye), is also sufficient to provide strong evidence. He said: "Since I entered the mountains in Yiyou, I transported no less than tens of thousands of volumes of books that I had collected. When the iron cavalry came, they were stationed at my humble residence, Shihe. Every spoonful, every grain, every thread, every strand was exhausted. And the books I had collected were all cut, peeled, torn, and ripped, and split into thousands of paper armors; coal marks and cinnabar spots were scattered on the backs of the horses; the rest were used as pillows and mats, and tens of thousands of blue silk books were lost in one day. The book "Mingwen Leichao," which I had compiled throughout my life, had been searched for in poems and prose from north and south for thirty years, and the net had almost exhausted. The volume was equal to Wen Yuan Ying Hua, but now it has also been paid to the flowing water." Below, he continued to describe the loss of some original manuscripts. The impact of war on the misfortune of books is truly unspeakable.</p>

<h3>Dusk (II)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Feeling infinite guilt in his heart, the father dared not look at his daughter's face, but was anxious, worried, and thinking about how to eliminate the suffering his daughter had endured through his own power.</p>
<p>--If I had no fame or money in this society, it would be easy!</p>
<p>But, soaring fantasy, is of no use at all; it only made him add a few strands of gray hair, and a wrinkle or two more on his face. He could only lower his head and let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>Every time he heard his wife and daughters talk about Qing Song's desolate situation, it was like cutting his heart with a blunt knife. Even though he was tolerating it, not shouting loudly, the tears would still hang down like beads on his wrinkled face. At this time, his most beloved son, Qing Shi, would be informed and rush to persuade him to take a walk in the garden, or start other conversations, so that he could temporarily forget about this matter.</p>
<p>"We must think of a way, Song girl can't live like this."</p>
<p>In private, the mother and Qing Zhi often said such words. Although they often said it, they didn't dare to say it to their father: but from observation, they could clearly see that he himself was also thinking about this matter every day.</p>
<p>Avoiding major twists and turns, and resolving minor troubles, Qing Song was welcomed back to her mother's house to live after a year.</p>
<p>But in Qing Song's heart, although she had returned to the home where she had grown up for nineteen years, she always felt an indescribable difference. In herself, a woman, a woman whose husband had died, should just be quiet; on the other hand, although it was said to be a due respect for a married daughter, Qing Song could easily think of it as indifference in her heart.</p>
<p>Only Qing Zhi treated her as before, even better than before. Qing Zhi accompanied her from morning to morning, as before, even when she was sleeping, she did not leave. When she was slightly troubled by loneliness, Qing Zhi was even more sensitive to it, and would sit with her affectionately.</p>
<p>They held hands silently, letting tears naturally cover their eyes, as if they wanted to pour out all the depression in their hearts, Qing Song sighed greatly.</p>
<p>Then they raised their eyes and looked at each other disappointedly, Qing Zhi said slowly:</p>
<p>"Don't always be so sad, second sister, can't we depend on each other every day by living at home?"</p>
<p>Qing Song immediately showed a suspicious look, she shook her head slightly, thinking that this was just her sister's good intentions, said to give her temporary comfort.</p>
<p>"Sister will always have a day to marry someone--"</p>
<p>"What, second sister," Qing Zhi's face turned a little red. "I don't want any man to be my husband, I want to accompany you. Accompany my sister to spend this life."</p>
<p>When she said this, Qing Zhi's voice was trembling, her face became even more red, agitated by this pure emotion, and her body trembled slightly.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear sister..."</p>
<p>Qing Song's face was filled with tears, and she hugged Qing Zhi and cried sadly.</p>

<h3>The Reasons for the Decline of the Chinese Coal Industry and its Remedies:</h3>
<p>(I) The Reserves and Production/Consumption of Chinese Coal</p>
<p>The exact amount of China's coal reserves remains unestimated to this day. According to Darke's estimate, it is 996,612,700,000 tons; according to the Japanese estimate, it is 12,997,300,000 tons; according to the Geological Survey Institute's estimate in 1926, it is 21,762,600,000 tons; however, their latest estimate in 1932 is 2,343,500,000 tons. It is well known that Chinese coal mines have not been thoroughly investigated. For example, many new coal mines were discovered in Guangdong and Fujian provinces two years ago, and after the Three Eastern Provinces and Rehe were occupied by Japanese imperialism, a more detailed survey changed the estimate of their reserves. Therefore, no one dares to judge which of the above figures is reliable! The figure published by the Geological Survey Institute in 1932 is between several estimates and is a more recent estimate, so it seems more reliable. Therefore, until we obtain a more accurate estimate, we have no choice but to use it temporarily. The estimated table is listed below: (unit: million tons)</p>
<p>Shanxi 5,830 Henan 1,755 Anhui 205 Jiangxi 815</p>
<p>Hunan 1,600 Shandong 685 Zhejiang 120 Hubei 130</p>
<p>Sichuan 1,500 Gansu 1,000 Fujian 150 Suiyuan 460</p>
<p>Yunnan 1,200 Rehe 930 Guangxi 500 Heilongjiang 160</p>
<p>Guizhou 1,300 Jilin 160 Guangdong 300 Shenyang 985</p>
<p>Hebei 2,370 Shaanxi 1,000 Jiangsu 190 Total 23,435</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that China's coal reserves are second only to the United States and Canada, ranking third in the world. It is more than twice that of Britain and Germany, and more than thirty times that of Japan. However, if we consider China's population, the actual amount is not that large. At present, China's coal consumption is very low, averaging about 0.04 tons per person per year (equivalent to 64 catties in Chinese weight). If calculated according to the annual consumption of 6 tons per person in Europe and America, China's coal reserves will be exhausted in 15 years. China's coal-producing areas are far from the industrial centers. The richest coal mines are in Shanxi Province, followed by Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces.</p>
<p>There are currently no accurate statistics on China's annual coal consumption, because the output of local kilns in various provinces is impossible to know. However, based on the statistically available coal production in various provinces in the past three years, excluding exports and including imports, the approximate figures are as follows: (unit: tons)</p>
<p>Year National Coal Production Export Volume Import Volume Consumption</p>
<p>1929 25,437,480 8,342,783 1,923,207 19,017,904</p>
<p>1930 26,026,563 8,136,678 2,167,122 20,067,007</p>
<p>1931 27,244,673 8,571,435 1,909,155 20,582,393</p>
<p>However, it was not until the early years of Emperor Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty that new methods were used to mine coal mines. The current national output, including local methods of mining, is only about 40 million tons per year. The following table lists the coal production of various provinces and major coal mines in the past five years for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Coal Production in Various Provinces in the Past Five Years (Unit: Tons)</p>

<p>From the above two tables, it can be seen that China's coal production has increased very little in recent years, and the largest production is from a few large coal mining companies. The first of these large coal mining companies is the Fushun Coal Mine operated by the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company, the second is the Kailuan Mining Bureau, nominally a joint Sino-British venture but with sovereignty in the hands of the British, and the third is the Fu Company, nominally a joint Sino-British venture but actually dictated by the British. As a result, foreign-operated coal mines account for more than 80% of the total coal production using modern methods nationwide. That is, the coal production operated by the Japanese accounts for 35%, the coal production operated by the British accounts for 30%, and the Russian-German joint venture accounts for 20%.</p>
<p>(II) Reasons for the Decline of the Chinese Coal Industry</p>
<p>Above, we have briefly described China's coal reserves, production, and consumption. Now, let's proceed to study the reasons for the decline of the Chinese coal industry!</p>
<p>Originally, before describing the reasons for the decline of the Chinese coal industry, we should also present some data to prove whether it is declining and to what extent it has declined. However, due to the limited space of this publication and the fact that the decline of the Chinese coal industry has become a clear fact that everyone who cares about society and the economy knows, we will not discuss it but directly study the reasons for the decline of the coal industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for the decline of the Chinese coal industry, according to my personal observations, the major ones are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Weak Capital, Small Scale, Backward Technology Currently, there are no statistics on Chinese capital invested in the coal mining industry. However, it can be seen from the fact that in recent years, many coal mining companies have closed down or reduced their operations due to lack of capital turnover. There is little Chinese capital invested in coal mines, and it is divided very finely, becoming small businesses scattered in various provinces, which is not as concentrated as foreign companies. Therefore, although there are dozens of Chinese companies nationwide, their production is less than that of foreign companies. Weak capital and small business scale are also related to technology, because they cannot arbitrarily use newer, more advanced, and better machines, and only seek to maintain the status quo without seeking improvement. Therefore, more than 40 years have passed since new methods were applied for mining in the fourth year of Emperor Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, and their technology is still very backward. As a result, the cost of coal production is very high. For example, in mines such as Pingxiang and Poluo in Jiangxi, it is 6.3 to 6.5 yuan per ton, in Changxing Coal Mine in Zhejiang it is 5 yuan, in Datong Company in Anhui it is 5.8 yuan, in Liuhegou in Henan it is 3.6 yuan, in Zhongyuan it is 3.17 yuan, in Baohua in Shandong it is 6.52 yuan, in Luda it is 3.85 yuan, and even the lowest such as the mines in Hebei are 2.25 to 2.85 yuan. With such high costs, plus the following reasons, it is no wonder that their sales are declining and they are in decline.</p>
<p>(2) Dumping of Japanese Coal Superficially, China's coal has a surplus every year and should not be subject to the pressure of dumping of foreign coal. However, in reality, the largest production volume of Chinese coal is from the Fushun Coal Mine operated by the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company. Moreover, Chinese-operated coal mines are burdened with heavy taxes, inconvenient transportation, high freight rates, and high costs, which give Japanese coal (including coal from Japan and Fushun coal) the opportunity to dump. Even if they do not depreciate and dump, it is difficult for domestic coal to compete with it, let alone when they depreciate on a large scale! The following table lists the recent situation of Japanese coal depreciating and dumping in Shanghai and the cost of domestic coal transported from the production area to Shanghai for reference.</p>

<p>1.700 yuan 2.26 yuan</p>
<p>However, Japanese coal is not only depreciated and dumped in Shanghai, but also in other places. According to reports, the comparison of Sino-Japanese coal prices in Hankou, Qingdao, and Tianjin is as follows: (unit: ton)</p>
<p>Sales Area Hankou Qingdao Tianjin</p>
<p>Chinese Coal 13.5 yuan 10+ yuan 10 yuan</p>
<p>(Ji Han Company) (Shandong Boshan Coal)</p>
<p>Japanese Coal 10 yuan 8 to 9 yuan 10 yuan</p>
<p>From the above tables, it can be seen the extent to which Chinese coal is oppressed by the dumping of Japanese coal in major domestic markets.</p>
<p>(3) Heavy Taxes "The taxes borne by domestic coal can be roughly divided into the following four categories: (A) Mining Area Tax: Zhongxing Coal pays 5 cents per mu for mined areas and 1 cent for unmined areas; Datong Coal pays 5 cents; Huadong Coal pays 2 cents within five years of mining and 5 cents after five years, and 1 cent for mining coal tax; Liuhegou Coal pays 5 cents; Zhongyuan Coal pays 5 cents; Huabao Coal pays 5 cents; Baojin Coal pays 5 cents; Changcheng Coal pays 2.5 cents; Baoxing Coal pays 3 jiao. (B) Production and Sales Tax: Zhongxing Coal pays 5% of the market price per ton; Datong Coal pays 4 jiao 5 fen; Huadong Coal pays 5% of the market price; Liuhegou Coal pays 2 jiao; Jingxing Coal pays 3 jiao; Zhongyuan Coal pays 2 jiao 5 fen; Huabao Coal pays 5 jiao; Huiyuan Coal pays 1 jiao 7 fen 5 li; Tianxing Coal pays 1 qian; Changcheng Coal pays 3 jiao for lump coal and 1 jiao 5 fen for fine coal; Baoxing Coal pays 1 jiao 7 fen 5 li. (C) Customs Tax: Zhongxing Coal pays 1 qian 5 fen of silver per ton; Datong Coal pays 2 jiao 3 fen; Huadong Coal pays 1 qian 2 zheng of silver; Liuhegou Coal pays 2 jiao 5 fen; Jingxing Coal pays 1 qian 5 fen of silver; Baojin Coal pays 2 jiao 7 fen; Changcheng Coal pays 1 qian 5 fen of silver for lump coal and 7 li 5 hao for fine coal. (D) Miscellaneous Taxes: Datong Coal pays 1,500 yuan annually for local education donations; Jingxing Coal pays 500 yuan per quarter for police donations, 150 yuan per quarter for security donations, 825 yuan per month for coal truck donations from the Public Security Bureau, and 100 yuan per month for public security donations; Huabao Coal pays 3 jiao of foreign currency per ton for government auxiliary donations; Baojin Coal pays about 6 jiao 2 fen 8 li 8 hao per ton; Tianxing tooth tax pays 1 fen per ton; Changcheng Coal pays 7 fen for public welfare donations per ton of lump coal and 4 fen for fine coal." (See the Shanghai News on December 10 last year.) This record cannot include all the donations and taxes of all coal mines completely, but it can give a glimpse of the heavy donations and taxes.</p>
<p>(4) High Freight Rates The high freight rates of Chinese coal can be roughly seen from the above table of the cost of transporting Chinese coal from the production area to Shanghai. The Business Department of the Ministry of Railways once wrote to the Shanghai Shenbao on October 9 last year to clarify that the freight rates were not too high (because the "Japanese Coal and Domestic Coal" commentary in Shenbao on October 4 mentioned that domestic coal freight rates were too high), saying: "...As for the freight rates, the Ministry has always adhered to the policy of maintaining domestic coal. Railway cargo is divided into six grades, and coal is listed in the lowest grade, originally at the same lowest cost as mud, sand, soil, and stone; however, in practice, the freight rates for coal on each line vary depending on the transportation situation and cost. Most coal-producing lines have special prices or discounts, often charging extremely low prices, which are already below the freight rates for mud, soil, and sand, and far less than the transportation cost. Why are they all included in the sixth grade? Recently, in order to maintain against the dumping of foreign coal, the Ministry has also specially maintained it. In addition to the repeated suspension of price increases for coal transportation on each line, the Ping-Han, Xiang-E, Jiaoji, and Ping-Sui lines have either given special reductions or discounts. For example, the Ping-Han Line charges only a little over 5 yuan 9 jiao per ton for transporting coal from Liuhegou to Hankou, which is currently priced at 32 yuan. The recent special price is only 5 yuan 3 jiao...If calculated according to the sixth-grade cargo of that line, the fee should be 17 yuan 07 fen, but the current freight rate is only 35% of the sixth grade, and the special price is less than one-third of the sixth grade...Recently, the price of gold has soared, and the cost of labor and materials has increased several times. The operating expenses are far from comparable to those of 20 years ago, but the freight rates for coal on each line have not only not increased but have decreased..." (See the Shanghai Shenbao on October 12 last year.) Although this is the case, in reality, because most of China's coal mines are located in the hinterland and transportation and transshipment are extremely inconvenient, the freight rates for coal are still too high, which has become one of the main reasons for the decline of the coal industry.</p>
<p>In addition, continuous natural and man-made disasters, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the general depression of industry, resulting in reduced coal consumption, and the occupation of the four northeastern provinces, which turned their coal into goods dumped in mainland China, are all reasons for the current decline of the Chinese coal industry.</p>
<p>(III) Remedies for the Decline of the Chinese Coal Industry</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, the following are the general strategies for remedying the decline of the Chinese coal industry:</p>
<p>(1) Reduce Coal Mining Costs As mentioned above, the cost of coal mining ranges from a minimum of 2 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen to a maximum of 6 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, which is more than double that of Japanese coal. Even if the railway provides free transportation, it is difficult to control the right to compete in sales. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to find ways to reduce coal mining costs. To reduce costs, it is necessary to raise huge sums of money, purchase new coal mining machinery, expand production, improve technology, apply scientific management methods, and supervise production.</p>
<p>(2) Impose a Tax on the Dumping of Foreign Coal Over the years, imported foreign coal has been dominated by Japanese coal. If Fushun coal is included, the annual amount is about 2 million tons or more. Although the current tariff is quite high compared to before, it is still not enough to prevent its import and dumping due to the depreciation of the Japanese gold. Therefore, the government should immediately implement a foreign coal dumping tax to increase its selling price so that domestic coal can compete with it.</p>
<p>(3) Reduce or Waive All Donations and Taxes As mentioned above, Chinese coal mining companies bear heavy donations and taxes. Therefore, in order to revive the currently declining coal industry, the central and local governments should implement a reduction in donations and taxes and waive all miscellaneous taxes to reduce the burden on coal mining companies.</p>
<p>(4) Reduce Railway Freight Rates and Purchase More Coal Transportation Vehicles The current railway coal freight rates are not only relatively too high, but there is also a shortage of coal transportation vehicles. For example, the coal shortage that occurred in the Yangtze River area two years ago due to the September 18 Incident and the boycott of Japanese coal was not because China lacked coal, but because there was a lack of vehicles for transporting coal, and the coal from the mines in North China and along the railways could not be transported to the ports along the Yangtze River. Later, the Ministry of Industry convened a national coal relief meeting and consulted with the Ministry of Railways on cooperation methods, allocating 50 more trains, which were directly commanded by the Ministry of Railways and specially used for transporting coal on each line. Only then was the problem adequately solved. Therefore, in order to save the currently declining Chinese coal industry, the government should once again reduce railway coal freight rates and purchase more vehicles to be allocated to each line for coal transportation.</p>
<p>(5) Organize a Coal Production and Sales Cooperative Company In developed capitalist countries, production and sales cooperative companies are organizations that monopolize the market and market prices. However, in industrially backward countries, they are actually organizations that resist foreign aggression and develop their own national industries. Because this organization can eliminate competition among the same industry and avoid unnecessary expenses such as transporting goods to distant places for sales. For example, the coal needed in the Hankou market can be supplied by coal mines near Hankou without having to be transported from coal mines in Hebei and Shandong. Profits and losses are distributed and borne by everyone. At a time when Japanese coal is being dumped and the Chinese coal industry is declining, I believe that organizing a national coal production and sales cooperative company, with joint production and joint sales, is one of the best relief strategies.</p>
<p>The relief strategies proposed above are not startling views, but I believe that if they can be implemented one by one, they will undoubtedly achieve considerable results.</p>

<h3>Discussing Silver Prices in the Midst of Busyness</h3>
<p>— Huan Cheng</p>
<p>Three years ago (1931), I was invited by colleagues at Zhongshe to speak on the topic of gold and silver. At that time, the price of silver was plummeting, and the people of our nation were in a state of panic! Some said that the wealth of a silver-using country had been secretly devalued by 60-70%, leading to inevitable poverty. Others claimed that the world treated silver as garbage, and we, as a silver-using nation, were simply inheriting the world's trash. In my speech (published in the first and second volumes of "New Society" and also as a separate publication), I made the following points. Now, revisiting old topics, let me first quote myself:</p>
<p>"What is the actual impact of gold being expensive and silver being cheap on our nation? I can answer in one sentence: Fortunately, we haven't suffered significant losses, and in some areas, it might even be beneficial. If we can strive to produce and be self-sufficient, even if the price of silver continues to decline, as long as it doesn't fluctuate wildly, society won't feel any harm. (Omitted). If the price of silver suddenly rebounds now, not to mention returning to the prices of 1919 or 1920, even returning to the prices of 1927 or 1928 would be enough to cause panic in our country. Many emerging factories would be forced to close. Merchants would suffer significant losses due to the price drop. The only beneficiaries would be a portion of importers. The benefits and harms of silver price fluctuations are relative. If we can make our productive forces flourish, it might even be more beneficial than harmful. The instability of silver prices is absolutely harmful with no benefits. Perhaps a very small number of fortunate speculators might benefit. For the sake of our nation, it's better to stabilize the price of silver than to raise or maintain it. If the price of silver is a matter of international concern, which our nation cannot control alone, then we must find a way to stabilize the exchange rate."</p>
<p>Time flies, and three years have passed in confusion. Our nation's military and civilians, from top to bottom, never thought about stabilizing the exchange rate. Now, with the United States loudly advocating for higher silver prices, the people of our nation are in a panic again, experiencing another wave of anxiety. Articles about silver prices are bustling in newspapers once more. I, too, cannot avoid being swept into the busy crowd, trying to say a few words.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to say is: Don't panic! The price of silver hasn't really risen much, and it's unlikely to surge suddenly now. If we prepare for the future, we should still focus on stabilizing the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Why do I say the price of silver hasn't risen much? Because the true international price of silver should be calculated in gold, not paper currency. Paper currencies vary from country to country and cannot be used as a standard. The gold exchange's標金 prices, which follow the U.S. dollar's rise, have actually deviated from the nature of gold, causing a significant price drop. In our commercial activities, most foreign exchange transactions involve the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. These three countries have abandoned the gold standard one after another, so we can't consider the depreciation of their currencies as a rebound in the price of silver. The U.S. forward price of silver is currently 46-47 cents per ounce. Discounting the U.S. dollar at 59.06%, it's actually less than 28 cents. In the past three years, before the United States abandoned the gold standard, the price of silver even exceeded 30 cents. Is a price of 28 cents considered a big increase? In reality, the price of silver is still "like a nephew carrying a lantern, nothing has changed."</p>
<p>Why is the price of silver unlikely to surge suddenly now? After reading the proposals of U.S. congressmen, it's truly frightening. A ratio of 16 to 1 between gold and silver, purchasing 100 million ounces, buying 50 million ounces per month – just how much of these schemes are actually feasible? It's not easy to understand. The true price of silver is international in nature. For the United States alone to raise the price of silver worldwide, even if it were possible, President Roosevelt has no personal stake in silver. Why bother with this troublesome and costly undertaking, while already busy with the Blue Eagle movement and the recovery plan? When the Silver Coinage Act was previously enacted, a purchase price of 64.5 cents was set for domestically produced silver. This was already considered a gesture to the silver mine owners who helped with the election. Afterwards, he lazily lost interest in the silver issue. Perhaps in the future, he might be unable to resist the pressure from congressmen and buy some silver stored in the domestic market (about 200 million ounces of silver are stored in New York City, mostly in the hands of speculators). Even if he buys it all up, if he doesn't continue to buy, the price of silver worldwide will not be affected, because the annual silver production has gradually increased (according to U.S. silver statistics, the average monthly production in 1931 was 13,213,000 ounces, 14,061,000 ounces in 1932, and 14,444,000 ounces in January this year), while China and India, the major consumers of silver, are buying less and less. India's treasury has 35 million ounces of silver available for sale each year according to the Silver Agreement. No other country has as much interest in silver as the United States. Germany minted silver coins a few years ago but melted them down and sold them on the market last year. If this situation doesn't change, even if the U.S. government buys up all the silver on the market, it will only raise the domestic price of silver, without affecting other countries. If you want to buy, others will be happy to sell to you. Eventually, you'll get full and naturally want to stop. I think the U.S. appetite for buying gold is much stronger than its appetite for buying silver. It's unlikely to become an "unlimited silver company," buying up all the unwanted goods in the world. Therefore, the true price of silver cannot rise sharply unless several powerful countries internationally cooperate to use silver coins. Unless war breaks out in the East (which would only have a lasting impact) or countries currently on the gold standard, such as France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Italy, all abandon the gold standard, there won't be a significant upheaval. In the past, those who advocated for raising the price of silver often said that restoring the purchasing power of silver-using nations in the East could revive the world economy. Now, this argument is gradually being debunked. The purchasing power of Eastern nations doesn't rely solely on the price of silver. Recently, telegrams sent by Shanghai banking circles and foreign merchants to the United States have further dismantled this argument. This has undoubtedly poured a bucket of cold water on silver advocates. Looking at the price of silver in isolation, it's just U.S. congressmen making noise, and it doesn't seem very optimistic. However, the rise and fall of exchange rates in various countries is a separate issue. If the United States continues to use expansionary policies and the U.S. dollar depreciates further, that's an exchange rate issue, completely unrelated to the price of silver.</p>
<p>Why should we focus on stabilizing the exchange rate to prepare for the future? Our nation's financial situation is truly miserable! When the price of silver falls, we panic! When the price of silver rises, we panic again! Following in the footsteps of others, we'll never be able to get ahead. I advocate that if the price of silver worldwide can be stabilized, we should work on the international level, and not rely solely on these empty silver agreements. If there are no stable international measures, we should plan for ourselves: establish a strong foreign exchange agency and use silver taxes to regulate the market. This way, our nation's currency value won't be completely affected by the international price of silver and can stabilize domestic prices. "Old Man Longevity singing a tune, it's always the same old song." Regardless of whether silver falls or rises, I still use the same stabilization formula. I said a lot about this in my speech three years ago, so there's no need to repeat it here.</p>
<p>What most people fear now is that if the international price of silver rises, silver stored in Shanghai will flow out. If we had a strong foreign exchange agency, at the time when domestic and international silver prices were balanced, it could preemptively purchase forward silver in London and New York and purchase forward bills of exchange in U.S. and UK in Shanghai. Then, when the domestic price of silver approaches the export point (domestic silver price plus freight, insurance, and miscellaneous fees equals the international market price, which is the export point; international silver price plus freight, insurance, and miscellaneous fees equals the domestic market price, which is the import point; the transfer of cash silver depends entirely on the export and import points, and has nothing to do with the level of prices), it could immediately sell the bills of exchange in Shanghai and sell the forward silver abroad. This would curb the outflow of silver. Unless there's an unusual crisis, this exchange agency can stabilize the market. It doesn't need to be sensational, but it can achieve the goal of stabilizing the exchange market. Why don't more people pay attention to this? Other countries use international exchange management and regulation policies to manipulate import and export trade. That's too advanced for me to dare copy and offer as a suggestion.</p>
<p>What I find most strange is that when the price of silver fluctuates greatly, people panic and offer all kinds of opinions. After a while, they ignore it again, hiding away and being lazy, without even discussing it. "Treating the head when it hurts, treating the foot when it hurts" – it's not a serious approach. Now everyone is making a fuss, but in a while, if the price of silver doesn't rise, everything will be quiet and peaceful, as if nothing happened. — March 6, 1934, Evening</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Loan Rates Plunge Sharply in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and all banks, both Chinese and foreign, were closed, so news about settlements was completely halted. The morning and afternoon foreign exchange loan rates in the market were free. The clearing house was, as usual, closed. Exchange transactions in the morning market amounted to over 3.8 million, new transactions over 200,000, afternoon market transactions over 400,000, and small association transactions over 300,000. Foreign exchange settlements at the money shops amounted to over 3.1 million, and there was no inflow or outflow of foreign exchange clearing funds. Various payments amounted to over 300,000. Regarding subsidiary coins, the Jiangnan small coins were almost extinct due to the lack of transactions. In the morning market, only 2,000角 were traded, and in the afternoon market, no transactions took place at all. The market price therefore plummeted, with the morning market at 805 yuan, a sharp drop of 15 yuan from the previous day. The few transactions that occurred were largely ignored. The Guangdong small coins were at 761 yuan in the morning market and 760 yuan and 8角 in the afternoon market, resulting in an increase of 4角 compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Transactions amounted to over 30,000 in the morning market and over 45,000 in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by another 1,500文 compared to the previous day, reaching 320,000文. Transactions amounted to 32,640 strings, totaling 10,200 yuan.</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Caught Between Bulls and Bears</h3>
<p>— The Market is Showing Fluctuations —</p>
<p>Last week (March 5th to 10th) at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to a period of stability and abundant capital, and with market prices already high, new bullishness was lacking. Short-selling had no opportunity to profit, and only the existing bulls and bears remained, patiently waiting for an opportunity. They observed each other, leading to a stalemate. Occasional swap deals or small liquidations would drive up prices, and no one was willing to concede. The environment was quiet, and the market was unbearably dull. This kind of fluctuation and brewing is unlikely to break this dull situation in the short term. Over the past week, Monday saw a slight increase of 6-7角 due to demand for numbers 48, 53, and 54, but only the opening trend was firm, and the rest tended to fluctuate. Tuesday was slightly weaker, with number 46 selling off aggressively for the 1922 bonds, with common shares falling by a small 3-5角 and the 1922 bonds by a significant 1.3-2 yuan. Wednesday saw a slight rebound of 3-4角, and the 1922 bonds rebounded by 8-9角. Therefore, although the first half of the week was characterized by fluctuations, there were still 3-5角 rises and falls. The second half of the week shifted from fluctuations to stagnation. Although daily rises and falls varied, the range was very small. In fact, each盤 showed both highs and lows, and some varieties saw no movement or were completely ignored, making transactions impossible. The market was idle and dull, which was exhausting. With market prices fluctuating, the salt tax bonds remained close to 53 yuan, unable to break out or fall. Judging from the situation, there is unlikely to be any change in the short term. Over the course of the week, only the 1922 bonds saw significant fluctuations, suggesting that the financial authorities were gradually selling them off. The resulting market prices saw a slight increase of 3-5角, with the 1919 bonds seeing the largest increase of 9角. Only the 1922 bonds saw a fall of 4.5-8.5角. The total trading volume was 40,097,000 yuan, including 20,000 yuan in spot transactions and 40,095,000 yuan in futures transactions. The highs, lows, rises, and falls are compared in the following table (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Lackluster Overseas Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was stagnant and lacked characteristics. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points and futures prices fell by 1 to 7 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 4 points and futures prices fell by 2-3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 4 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to speculator buying but then fell back as bulls liquidated their positions. As a result, Pingar fell by 2 rupees, Omra fell by 7.5角, and Broach fell by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded below (March 10th telegram):</p>

<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3>Lamentations Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>I don't know if it's the destiny of the nation or due to human error, but in recent years, our divine land of China has constantly suffered from political and economic encroachment from the outside, and internal strife and disasters have been endless. The so-called "natural disasters and human calamities" have truly been fully experienced. Those of us who live in the city, besides struggling under the whip of life and constantly feeling the threat of hunger, have no way to truly understand the actual situation of the vast Central Plains, filled with the smell of gunpowder. As for the wealthy and powerful who revel in the embrace of the city, enjoying air conditioning and electric fans indoors and driving "Austins" and "Buicks" outdoors, they merely treat the news of "turmoil" in the newspapers as idle talk after tea and dinner, considering it an exaggerated description by "overseas tales" correspondents.</p>
<p>Indeed, news of rural economic collapse, severe disasters, and numerous refugees fills the newspapers and magazines, but how they actually live and what proportion they constitute of our 400 million people remain somewhat unclear. According to the recent announcement by the Disaster Relief Committee, there are already 65 million disaster victims in the fourteen provinces of the north and south of the Yangtze River. The "large number" is "truly shocking." I feel that this news truly paints a concrete picture of China's "natural disasters and human calamities."</p>
<p>This number is not calculated based on the entire country, nor is it a complete statistic for the eighteen provinces within the country. Therefore, considering the entire nation, the magnitude of the number is even more shocking. Currently, taking China's population of 400 million as a base, excluding the 30 million in the three northeastern provinces, assuming 10 million in the northwestern areas of Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, Qinghai, and Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, the population of the statistically analyzed fourteen provinces, excluding Rehe and the three northeastern provinces of the inner eighteen provinces, is about 300 million. Comparing the number of 65 million disaster victims to 300 million, it means that in these fourteen provinces, one out of every five or four people is a disaster victim. This means that one out of every four or five people is already groaning in hunger and cold and is about to reach the point where they cannot preserve their lives.</p>
<p>Besides a portion of these people who are being deprived of their right to survive and who recognize their own environment and future and strive actively or resign themselves to fate and die, another portion rolls into the waves of "robbing and plundering," flowing into the paths of open robbery and secret theft. The surging of these waves creates countless hungry masses, increasing new "human calamities." As for the continuous "natural disasters," a large part of them are the result of public facilities being destroyed by "human calamities." When we think of these 60 to 70 million disaster victims, suffering from hunger and cold, drinking porridge and eating grass roots, tree bark, and 관음토, even selling their wives and children to eat, we truly don't know whether we should scratch our heads and question the heavens or hide in the ground and blame people!</p>
<h3>Hope is Still Hope</h3>
<p>— Bo'er</p>
<p>Whoever buys an aviation lottery ticket holds a great hope. The greatest hope is 500,000 yuan, and the smallest hope is two yuan. However, if none of the numbers match, then hope remains hope. Regardless, it is still a hope.</p>
<p>On the second of this month, I don't know how many people were still desperately buying aviation lottery tickets. They thought that as long as they spent one yuan, they could get rich at two o'clock in the afternoon. Who wouldn't want that? Be brave! Spend one yuan! Everyone thought that way in their hearts. The person standing at the counter held one paper ticket after another and said to the inside: "Ah, a lottery ticket, two tickets, another ticket, selling well!"</p>
<p>Two friends, A and B, bought twenty tickets. They were walking on the road, and A said: "Hey, friend! What time is it now?" B said: "Soon, don't worry! There are still two minutes." They were happily striding forward. Not far away, they suddenly heard the broadcasting machine of the large company ringing... The first prize is the third… A said: "Oh no! "B said: "Listen to the last number!</p>
<p>"The first prize is the third two four five zero four." The broadcasting machine announced the last number. A and B looked at each other, very disappointed, with nothing good to say. A generously gave his tickets to B, and B also gave his tickets to A. They thought it was better to spend one yuan to go to the teahouse, so they walked into Xin Ya. When they came down from Xin Ya again, it was already past four o'clock.</p>
<p>Xin Ye Bao…Look at the aviation first prize…Xin Ye Bao…</p>
<p>The first prize, second prize, and third prize are all out, Xin Ye Bao… The newspaper boys on the road were shouting very hard, running from this side of the road to that side of the road. We could see everyone holding a Xin Ye Bao in their hands, flipping it open to look at it. Coincidentally, everyone was desperately repeating those numbers. A and B bought a newspaper and jumped on the tram. B said: "Hey, if we had won, we wouldn't need to take the tram now." However, April 27th, there's only a month and a half. We can still hope." A said: "What we have won is hope. I've been buying since the first issue, and I've spent quite a bit of money. This time, I have to hope for the fifth issue. I think hope will still be hope. 文永 won't become 500,000, will it?"</p>
<h3>Divided Fates</h3>
<p>— Yi Lu</p>
<p>The relationship between Mr. Bu and Mrs. Bu had finally developed an extremely deep rift, with no room for reconciliation.</p>
<p>In Mr. Bu's heart, he felt this was the regret of his life: he shouldn't have recklessly abused love, leading to this unbearable blow to his soul today. But on Mrs. Bu's side, she wasn't unaware that she was being overly cruel today, nor was she unaware that "divorce" (?) was the most painful scene in a life's tragedy. But she knew that to pursue a fulfilled life, pain was something one had to taste, and moreover, this kind of pain was meaningful and valuable. She also knew that she was still very young, and she wanted to use her youth to exchange for a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>In the end, their hearts grew further and further apart, no longer able to pulsate and resonate together as they once did.</p>
<p>"I knew all along that women who work as waitresses are always lowly, but I knowingly went against my better judgment, I really should slap myself in the face," Mr. Bu sighed bitterly.</p>
<p>"What shameless thing have I done? You call me lowly," Mrs. Bu, who had been sitting on a chair by the square table, staring blankly out the window, now suddenly stood up and faced Mr. Bu.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have stared so intently at that Mr. Wang yesterday, you shouldn't have talked to him, you shouldn't have..."</p>
<p>"You suspicious monkey! What right do you have to interfere with my</p>
<p>freedom?"</p>
<p>"Freedom, hmph! A woman should always be docile and self-effacing, but you? You're a shameless hussy! A hussy!" Mr. Bu's anger flared up again.</p>
<p>"You have the nerve to say that, can you even be considered a man? The rice yesterday, I had to borrow money from my older sister to buy it. One marries for food and clothing, why marry if one has no food and clothing? You pig!" Mrs. Bu was so enraged that she even revealed her private affairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Bu considered this the ultimate humiliation, his face instantly turning ashen. He walked over and, with a loud slap, gave Mrs. Bu a smack across the face, saying nothing more. Then everything erupted into chaos: chairs were kicked over, tables were overturned, followed by a clatter of bowls and dishes falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Here, Mrs. Bu seemed to be gradually losing her strength because she was, after all, a woman. Finally, cries of "Help! Help!" were squeezed from her mouth. Following that, a series of footsteps on the stairs startled everyone in the house.</p>
<p>The first one to arrive was the landlady, Mrs. Liu, a middle-aged woman who waddled into the room with her plump body. She was the most enthusiastic person, so she ran the fastest and was the first to speak: "What's going on? Why are you fighting?" At this time, Mr. Bu felt embarrassed, so he first got up from the ground. At the same time, Mrs. Bu, knowing that people were coming up, found her courage revived. She got up, walked in front of Mr. Bu, grabbed his collar, and said, "Hit me, hit me," and then bumped her head against him.</p>
<p>After much persuasion and pulling by many people, the two bodies were half-pushed and half-willingly separated.</p>
<p>"Talk things out, why resort to violence? Once the anger subsides, you'll regret it. You're all family, what's the point?" Landlady Liu was the first to speak again, her words very light.</p>
<p>"I can't live this kind of life..." Mrs. Bu finally burst into tears on the bed.</p>
<p>"If you want to leave, then get out!" Mr. Bu trembled with anger.</p>
<p>"Fine, I'll get out, just say the word."</p>
<p>"Why do this? Everyone should be more tolerant, wouldn't that turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems at all? Besides, think about the affection you once had for each other, and you won't have the heart to do this... And the hearts of people outside are so bad!" After all, Mrs. Liu had considerable experience in the ways of the world, especially in relationships between men and women.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Liu's words are really good, yes, people's hearts are too bad!" Mrs. Yang, who lived in the front room, chimed in.</p>
<p>"You don't understand, I've had enough of this kind of life, I can't take it anymore, I have to divorce him (?)" Mrs. Bu's intention was very firm. At the same time, the fulfilled life she yearned for seemed to flash in her mind immediately.</p>
<p>The next day, a very small announcement was found in the newspaper: XXX and XXX have agreed to end their cohabitation.</p>
<h3>My Troubles</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>In the gloomy sky, I heard a series of clear sounds: "Red lanterns in every home, red lanterns in every home." "Better to return, better to return." Added to this was the wailing of the train whistle coming from the station. People were snoring, indicating that they were in the midst of sweet sleep. I opened my eyes, staring at a corner of the sky, watching it change from pitch black to grayish-white, and then from grayish-white to the radiance of dawn. On the earth, in the campus, in the dormitory, there was still a deathly silence, with only snoring punctuating my surroundings. I really didn't want to get up, my limbs were so sore. I had been busy all day yesterday with matters related to entering the school. In the evening, I replayed the bitterness of parting, which kept me from falling asleep all night.</p>
<p>I said goodbye to my hometown, left my parents at home, and came with my luggage to this sinful, bustling Shanghai. It was for the sake of studying, for the sake of solving the future lives of myself and my parents, but I doubt, I doubt immensely, whether studying will really be able to solve the future of my life? The summer vacation is about to come to an end, and graduation is supposed to be a cause for celebration, but in the real society, graduation is the beginning of unemployment, because in the current state of unemployment panic, can society safely accommodate the forty or fifty of us graduating at the same time? Ah! Joyful graduation, terrifying graduation!</p>
<p>It was broad daylight, so I got up to go to class, finished the morning and continued with the afternoon, and then went to evening classes. I spent almost the entire day in the classroom. Another day had passed. The sky turned dark again. I walked out of the evening classroom with a throbbing head, and walked back to the dormitory to sleep. Above, there was a bright moon in the sky, accompanying this lonely person as he passed the basketball court and then through the small pavilion on the campus. "Ah! It's like I'm coming back from the sales department, accepting the goods sold by the teachers. (Teachers are the shopkeepers in the sales department, and students are their patrons.) The records on the phonograph have been changed many times, some are from "Triangle," some from "Physical</p>

<p>Sciences," "Higher Algebra," "Solid Geometry," "</p>
<p>Chinese," "English"... No wonder my body is so heavy and my head is so stuffy. It turns out I've stuffed so much in again!..."</p>
<p>My roommate was already asleep before me. The once lively air in the room had turned completely quiet again. I looked at the bright moon in the sky, thinking about my parents, who were eagerly awaiting me. "Ah! Can I fulfill their fervent hopes?" Of this, I am very unsure...</p>
<h3>Visiting the Tomb by Dai Ni:</h3>
<p>Morning, a gloomy sky, no wind. I dragged my heavy steps, following behind the street sweeper, walking like a blind man. I finished walking a long road and turned into another.</p>
<p>My eyes were fixed on the ground, and I saw my two toes moving forward. They seemed like two melancholy eyes. From the moment I met her, she was a girl of melancholy.</p>
<p>Shops, foreign houses, tree trunks, I had already walked on the road paved with yellow sand. Melancholy eyes shone in front, and a devil-like ancient temple stood with two corners of its roof.</p>
<p>My pace seemed even slower, and the melancholy eyes more clearly captivated the road ahead. The old man guarding the temple always wore a smile and stopped sweeping, greeting me with "Umm... Umm."</p>
<p>"Cold, isn't it?" I said casually, and he followed me</p>
<p>inside.</p>
<p>Everything was dilapidated. Sparrows chirped in the gaps of the tiles, perhaps feeling that the atmosphere here was too desolate. Although the old man always wore a smile, he didn't seem to have any delicious leftovers to offer them; they flapped their</p>
<p>small wings and flew to the wilderness—the overgrown graves, the small paths paved with yellow sand, the people? He had already walked past two rows of houses to visit his friend in another world. The old man mechanically started a fire in the row of houses. A cup of not very good tea could earn him a year's worth of food.</p>
<p>I walked straight inside, my pace even slower, almost dragging. My hands were in my pockets, and my head was buried. I walked past countless tombstones, like countless pairs of melancholy eyes, until I reached the last one, where I sat down on the grass.</p>
<p>My hands were empty. I didn't bring flowers, I didn't bring sacrificial words, all I brought was a melancholy heart!</p>
<p>Looking at the sky, gloomy and without wind. A pair of melancholy eyes on the tombstone stared at me, just like when we first met. After a quick glance, she stared at her own two toes.</p>
<p>"Are you spitting blood?" she seemed to say to me.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"My dad said you should rest..." Melancholy eyes swept past me.</p>
<p>"I think so too..."</p>
<p>"We're going to Hangzhou next week." She stared at her toes.</p>
<p>"But I can't leave work."</p>
<p>The scene in front of me seemed to blur. I couldn't see the tombstone, I couldn't see the melancholy eyes. I raised my head and looked at the sky, a blurry patch of white clouds. Is this another world? I wondered.</p>
<p>With a great effort, something seemed to escape from my eyes. The old man, who always wore a smile, was already standing in front of me. "Sir, would you like a cup of tea inside?"</p>
<p>I habitually glanced at the tombstone one last time, stared at my toes, and followed the old man.</p>
<p>I sat in the dimly lit house, not saying a word. I took a sip of tea, took out a dollar and gave it to the old man as a tip. He gratefully smiled and bowed, escorting me out the door.</p>
<p>The sky was gloomy, with no wind. I stared at my toes, walking home on the path paved with yellow sand.</p>

<h3>Lulu's Victory (8)</h3>
<p>— Written by Italian M. Serao, translated by Jingxin</p>
<p>"Oh, well!" Lulu shrugged her shoulders and changed the subject, saying: "Are you really not coming with us tonight?"</p>
<p>"No, I have a headache, you can go with Mom."</p>
<p>"What does it matter, I can still be green, because I can have a very happy time."</p>
<p>"Then... is Robert going with you too?"</p>
<p>"No; he's going to the club, where there's a board meeting. I'm taking this opportunity to go to Delino's ball, and I'll dance until dawn."</p>
<p>"But what if he knows about it?"</p>
<p>"All the better. From now on, he can learn to let me be free; I don't want him to have that bad habit."</p>
<p>"It seems to me that you don't love him very much."</p>
<p>"I love him very much, but I have my own way. Now I have to go get dressed, which will take me at least two hours."</p>
<p>Sophia stood there listening to the sudden sound of the carriage carrying her mother and sister away. She was left alone, very alone. She always liked to be alone. Like a child, when she was bullied, she would cry alone, and she also had this habit when she was in bed or in the dark. Now she stood alone in this large living room, under the bright lights. Her hands were listlessly placed down, her head resting on the back of the chair, her face revealing a very sad expression. This could make us clearly understand that there was a fierce conflict in her heart. Indeed, in this complete solitude, a very painful awareness dominated her; emotions from reality that she had long dared not examine now became clear and cruel.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps startled her. The person who came was Robert. Seeing her alone, he stopped, hesitating; but he thought that the others might be in the other room, so he went forward. Sophia stood up, agitated.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Sophia."</p>

<h3>The Issue of Directors also Being Screenwriters</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The Chinese film industry is gradually progressing, and many practitioners are doing their best to move forward. This is a fact we can see. But if we observe carefully, we can find that in this developing film industry, there is still a lack of a full spirit of cooperation.</p>
<p>Film is a comprehensive art. The composition of a perfect film must obtain the full cooperation of capitalists and practitioners. Among the practitioners, there are directors who manage general affairs, literary screenwriters, and artists, photographers, editors...etc. Everyone must be able to do their job competently, and everyone must be able to cooperate hand in hand, in order to produce a good film.</p>
<p>Among all kinds of cooperation, the division of labor and cooperation between directors and screenwriters is the key to the success or failure of a film. In European and American countries, screenwriting is a specialized profession. Most film scripts are written by experts, and then handed over to the director to handle. Although there are also many scripts written by the director, this kind of concurrent job can only be regarded as an exception. Because screenwriting is a time-consuming and heavy task, it is inevitable that the director will be distracted and delay the progress of film production.</p>
<p>Great directors such as Ernst Lubitsch, Cecil B. DeMille, and King Vidor all have their favorite and skilled screenwriters. When they decide to shoot a certain film, they hand over the subject matter to the screenwriter to handle. After the director tells the screenwriter some of his own ideas, he lets the screenwriter use his skills to write it. This allows the director to follow the script and add to the imaginative structure, make corrections and arrangements, and then start shooting. Sometimes, when the director feels that the work is too heavy, two screenwriters will be assigned to work together.</p>
<p>In our Chinese film industry, we still simplify things due to poor conditions, so naturally we cannot compare everything to Europe and the United States. But it is certainly not a blessing for the future of the film industry that the director has to serve as both a director and a screenwriter for every film. Some people say that Chinese directors all have the talent for screenwriting, but I would say that Chinese screenwriters can all direct.</p>
<p>The busyness of screenwriting and the painstaking effort of directing both clearly require specialized talents to handle, and require more than one person's mental communication and precise consideration. The imperfect results of general domestic films, and even the fact that things lacking common sense and contrary to reason often appear on the screen, show how risky it is to rely on the talent of a single director. And many key moments for making a good drama pass by blandly, which all shows that the director is flustered in the moment, and that there was a lack of precise cooperation from a good screenwriter, which caused the film to suffer from anemia after it was produced, and turned a good film into something rigid.</p>
<p>Where are the good screenwriters in China? This is certainly still a question. However, judging from the facts in recent years, our filmmakers do not value the importance of scripts, which is the truth. As a result, they only force the director to hand in the paper. No wonder the themes of general domestic films are so dry and far-fetched, compared to the ever-changing European and American films, they are really worlds apart—</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3>From "Eskimo" to Imperialism</h3>
<p>— Shouzi</p>
<p>"Eskimo" is a rare masterpiece among the current American films that focus solely on sensual and erotic content, extravagance, and excitement. Its greatness has already been introduced in this newspaper, but I still have a few opinions.</p>
<p>If this film is said to expose the evils of imperialism, then we should strictly criticize its exposure as being insufficient and very incorrect. The evils of imperialism are of an entire racial class, but here only one shipowner bears all the guilt, and the other crew members and police all seem to be humanitarians. In this way, it is easy for the audience to mistakenly believe that what this film exposes is not the evil of the entire capitalist class, but only the evil of the shipowner alone. The object is not correct. This is one. Secondly, anti-imperialism should also be of the entire oppressed class, but what this film depicts is only one person's heroic struggle. Why did Mala end up wandering aimlessly with his wife? It should be the entire Eskimo nation rising up to fight together. Even if everyone dies in battle. This is two. This point has also been roughly mentioned in the previous criticism in this newspaper, but it was not explained very clearly, so I solemnly supplement a few words here. Of course, I cannot be too nitpicky, but since it has been pointed out that the content of this film is anti-imperialist, then we have to point out its shortcomings a little. Because this kind of erroneous performance can easily lead the audience into an incorrect impression, they should be told.</p>
<p>Originally, this is a product of a capitalist country, so it is already somewhat satisfactory that it dares to boldly expose the evils of a part of the white race.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Angry Tide of the China Sea"</h3>
<p>— Keluo</p>
<p>Although this film has been limited by objective conditions, and many places have lost their original appearance, it still has sufficient power to grasp the emotions of the audience, especially when the fishermen, having endured enough, unite to fight the foreign fishing boats.</p>
<p>From this film, we can see how difficult and hard-pressed the fishermen's lives are under the layers of oppression from usurious lenders, corrupt gentry, and imperialists.</p>
<p>The director demonstrated his extraordinary intelligence in this film, starting by using the fish in the plate to symbolize the lives of the fishermen, which can also be said to symbolize the lives of the entire Chinese nation. Later, he used the killing of the mouse that stole the rice to show the fishermen's hatred for the oppressors, giving the audience a powerful hint. The rest, such as Ad running on the beach next to Afu's corpse, with the close-up of his sad face, and then using the gloomy sky to set it off, even more powerfully stirred the audience's heartstrings. These are all places where the director is exceptionally intelligent.</p>
<p>The actors were all successful. Jiao Da (played by Qin Tong) was kind and simple; Afu (played by Zha Ruilong) and Ad (played by Wang Yin) were stubborn and calm; Xiao Rong's wife (played by Lei Mengna) was careless and shrewish. Each person's personality was fully expressed; especially Yuan Meiyun, who played A Ju, perfectly portrayed her caution when she was a maid in the Zhang family, and her naivety and liveliness when she was drifting on the seashore. It is worthy of praise!</p>
<h3>Charles Farrell Re-teams with Janet Gaynor</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>This is very good news, that the old partners from "Seventh Heaven," Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor, have re-teamed. There are various rumors about the reason why Charles and Janet separated, and perhaps only the two of them know the truth. But everyone said that the biggest reason was because Janet was too famous, overshadowing his reputation. Now, since he terminated his contract with Fox Corporation, he has been "freelancing" in various companies and has established an independent reputation. Therefore, the general audience has requested that he and Janet Gaynor work together again. Charles Farrell then agreed to the audience's request. Not only did he agree to the audience's request, but he also re-signed a contract with Fox Corporation to co-star with Janet Gaynor in a film called "The Sun Shines Bright." So these two emperors and empresses of the screen are sitting together again to meet their subjects. At the same time, Fox Corporation has two old partners re-teaming, namely James Dunn and Sally Eilers. Some people say that this is a new sign of the revival of the film industry.</p>
<h3>Jeanette MacDonald's New Film "The Merry Widow" Starts Filming — Xifu:</h3>
<p>Jeanette MacDonald has not starred in a new film for a long, long time since she parted ways with Maurice Chevalier, but now it has been decided to produce a new musical film called "The Merry Widow," and he has decided that his co-star will be Joan Crawford. It is said that this "The Merry Widow" was originally an old film from 1925, starring Mae Murray and John Gilbert, and directed by Erich von Stroheim. Now, MGM has changed the script of that film to suit Chevalier's style.</p>
<p>The current "The Merry Widow" is directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Because of the reunion between Chevalier and Lubitsch, everyone has been discussing whether there is any possibility of him and his old partner Jeanette MacDonald working together again. But Chevalier has decided that he is unwilling to work with her. The reason is that the success of the previous films was due to the equal contributions of Chevalier and MacDonald, but when the two of them traveled to Europe together two years ago, the entire city of Paris was very fond of Jeanette, but Chevalier felt cold. Therefore, Chevalier felt that Jeanette had monopolized his beauty, and therefore he was unwilling to work with her. MGM had recommended many famous female singers to Chevalier to co-star in "The Merry Widow," but Chevalier felt that although their voices were good, they were not very famous. Therefore, he decided to invite Joan Crawford to co-star with him. Joan heard this and happily agreed.</p>
<h3>"Spring Dreams in the Dance Hall"</h3>

<h3>A Colorful History of Mount Hua (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Chun</p>
<p>Director: Cheng Bugao; Starring: Xu Lai, Xi Jianong, Chen Ningqiu; Production: Mingxing Film Company</p>
<p>In the summer of 1926, the ancient capital's earthen city walls were softly enveloped in the gentle breeze, dreaming its nostalgic dreams. The air was scorching hot, lulling people to sleep.</p>
<p>Inside the highest institution of learning in Beiping, the examination hall was bustling with activity, holding end-of-term exams. Hong Jiachen, a law student, held a "Constitutional Law Lecture" and a mimeographed test paper in his hand. He had just come out of the examination hall and was walking thoughtfully along the corridor. Yu Lan, a literature student and a charming woman, came towards him.</p>
<p>"So fast! How did you do? The future great lawyer, Mr. Hong!" she said with a charming smile, teasing him. Jiachen also replied with a smile:</p>
<p>"Four questions, I ate one and a half salted duck eggs. The future writer, Miss Yu!"</p>
<p>They smiled silently, feeling a little awkward, and then they talked about how to spend the summer vacation.</p>
<p>A college student, loving and diligent in their studies, would probably not neglect them. Yu Lan was in love with a fellow literature student, a tall man called Chen Beifeng, the poet of Changbai Mountain. She said she would discuss it with Beifeng.—They went together to Beifeng's dormitory.</p>
<p>The dormitory was quiet, and the sound of a zither leaked out of the window. The poet Beifeng always loved to play the zither; music and poetry were like his life. However, his fat roommate, You Guangzhao, was always lulled to sleep by the sound of his zither.</p>
<p>Yu Lan and Hong Jiachen ran into the dormitory. Yu Lan introduced Hong to Beifeng, and Hong asked:</p>
<p>"What are your plans for the summer? Are you going back to the Northeast?"</p>
<p>Beifeng shook his head pedantically: "Poetic feeling and poetic interest have all been blown away by the yellow dust of the city. I plan to take advantage of the summer to go to the summit of Mount Hua and write some works."...</p>
<p>As they were talking, there was a knock on the door, and another classmate came in, Huang Zhensheng, Beifeng's fellow villager, a burly young man with a bit of heroic spirit. He greeted everyone present with restraint, hesitating for a long time before finally pulling Beifeng outside:</p>
<p>"Beifeng, I can no longer breathe this deathly air. I have decided to leave for Whampoa tonight."</p>
<p>He said so solemnly and sadly that Beifeng only felt gloomy. The two faced each other, dominated by a melancholy mood. After a long silence, they shook hands warmly once, and Zhensheng left resolutely.</p>
<p>Each person's personality and consciousness determined their lives: Hong Jiachen planned to take advantage of the summer vacation to go to Shanghai for sightseeing: Yu Lan and Beifeng naturally went to Mount Hua to write poetry, play the zither, and talk about love.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The scenery of Mount Hua is so magnificent and beautiful. Yu Lan and Beifeng, this perfect couple, wandered for some time among the poetic and picturesque deep mountains and white clouds, and then returned to school in Beiping.</p>
<p>Hong Jiachen, who had returned from sightseeing in Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the East, and Yu Lan, who had explored the sea of clouds on Mount Hua, met. Yu Lan was such a contradictory and wavering woman. On the one hand, she pursued an imaginary, poetic spiritual life; on the other hand, she yearned for the material enjoyment of modern civilization. Hong Jiachen gave her many things he had brought back from Shanghai and told her a lot about the prosperity and beauty of Shanghai. A look of envy rippled across Yu Lan's face. (To be continued)</p>
<p>("Empress Catherine" is suspended for a few days due to the late arrival of the sequel.)</p>
