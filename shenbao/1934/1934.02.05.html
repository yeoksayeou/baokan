<h3>德奥衝突與歐洲政局英</h3>
<p>德國自入於希特拉之掌握以來。外交政策之基調。無非企圖發展國社黨之力勢於全歐。建立同系政權於異國。蓋因其在凡爾塞條約束縛之下。欲實行領土擴張自不得不爲此侵略變相的方針。以突破敵國長圍之策劃。然而卒由此引起意大利之嫉視形成今日歐洲政局中兩大法西斯體系之明爭暗鬭。而尤於粤國之外交關係見其端倪。此誠亦一右關歐局之嚴重問題也。　　奥之對德向爲與國然自德國積極活動以來。意大利以圖覇歐洲雄心勃勃之地位。不能熟視無睹。乃竭力向奥運用。於是奥意關係。遂如水乳交融。希特拉知其然。益不能放棄此關頭。積極嗾使黨徒。公開活動於奥國國境以内。竟以外交關係。引起奥國國内黨派之紛爭。因此。現時親近意國之杜爾非斯政府。遂於本年一月十七日致牒文於德國要求德當局公開宣言。不再干涉奥國内政。德國卽於最近致覆文於奥國。稱德奥糾紛。乃歷史運動且謂「有某種政制。對於凡屬能使德意志民族重行振作之運動。悉置諸法外不予保護。德國對於此種政制。能袖手旁觀漢不相干乎。」於該覆文結論又謂。「德國正在進行調查乃奥國不待調查結果。又起訴於他國政府。此德國所認爲奇異者。」德國方面之態度。如是倔强。宜乎奥國於覆文到違以後。全國上下。一致認爲不滿。奥總理杜爾非斯。且於下奥大利十萬農民大示威運動之前。（據二月二日柏林路透電）高呼「吾人爲奥國之名譽自由而奮　。奥國人民均爲德意志民族。以往如是。以後永遠如是。」其激昂憤慨之情形。一時不可遏抑。德奥關係。蓋已瀕於短兵相接之時矣。夫希特拉在今日凡爾塞條約束縛之下。東與蘇聯不睦。西與法國爲仇。外交已極孤立。乃猶敢與奥爲難嗾使其黨徒活動。以間接失歡於意國。何其　預如是乎。然而希特拉於外交方面。亦未嘗貿然一無佈置。以爲對奥交涉之凖備也。試觀本年一月二十六日。德波十年不侵條約。突告成立。不先不後。適在此德奥關係緊張之時。則知希特拉之和睦東鄰。實非無的放矢。而德奥衝突之發展。將從此有增無已。亦可顯見矣。</p>
<p>且希特拉之積極圖奥。其目的固非僅以奥爲止境也。凡捷克匈牙利諸國。莫不爲希特拉之錦標。誠以地當昔日之奥匈帝國。據多腦河之中心。久與德國爲兄弟之邦。有歐洲霸權舉足輕重之勢。希特拉之欲得而甘心者。已非一朝。今茲之東結波蘭。南侵中歐。以驅逐意大利之勢力。勢已顯然。此後中歐各國將何去何從乎。而法國之態度。又將何如乎。以吾人測之。暫時似未必有所左右袒。法之視德。殆亦猶法之親意乎。</p>

<p>（東京）　日政府因米榖豐收、地主及佃户生活萬分困難、决犧牲台灣及朝鮮兩殖民地之民衆、爲日本國地主佃户造福、甚堅决地改變其米糓政策、則聽政民兩黨之要求修改米糓統制法、其目的在於阻制台灣與朝鮮兩殖民地米運日、與日米竸爭、致使日米市價跌落、藉以維持日米市價、卽維持公定價絡、避免農民起搖動、殖民地米管理問題、由農拓兩省與兩殖民地政府洽商中、惟兩政府因恐增加被統治民族之反抗、對本國之要求仍不同意、力爭管理方法、减輕其犧牲之程度惟后藤農相堅决代表統治民族之利益、决於六日之閣議提出殖民地米管理案及米糓修政案、使閣議通過、然後迫兩殖民地政府承認、聞農相之對策爲（一）殖民米歸政府管理、（二）殖民地削减米糓之生產量、提倡改種雜糓、（三）殖民地米出口特許制、（四）殖民地施行特别米糓等、四案中擇一施行云、（四日華聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）　第六十五屆議會再開後、經兩星期、衆議院擬於五日在預算總會席上截止質問、而入第二期論戰、貴院則無議案、連日以綱紀問題爲中心、議鋒甚烈五日關於肅淸綱紀及敎育疑獄等問題、由關直彥氏追擊政府、倘屆時中島商相之答辯未能掃除疑惑、則問題更形惡化、尙有肅淸軍紀·及軍民離間問題·滿洲問題·國防問題·農村問題·財政問題·當由大河内子爵·菊地男爵·岩倉男爵·付松男爵等人、可謂集貴族院之精銳一齊開始總攻、是以議會之中心、頗有暫由衆議院　移至貴族院之形勢、政府應如何布其防禦陣容、依現在之情形觀之、則貴族院當不免遇其相當難關云、（四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日下院對政府態度稍和緩、關於軍人干政·軍民離間聲明·軍紀問題等、不致再發展、至於農村對策、因首相藏相及農相已接受兩黨之建議、决從速提出對策、解决米價·　絲統制·及殖民地米管理問題、亦可謂告一段落、一九三五大年之軍縮令對策及南洋羣島領土權問題、海相及外相均有切實答復、政黨已無可藉口、惟中島商相一身上之問題、則尙須接洽、明年度之預算案定三月十三日送上院、上院之態度甚堪憂慮、但自荒陸相下台后、政黨及財閥對軍閥感情亦稍和緩、日政府對前途漸抱樂觀云、（四日華聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）　政友會内部鈴木總裁與鳩山文相一派、及以床次竹二郎爲盟主之政黨提携派對立之傾向、其後愈益尖銳化、舉行種種集會、目的均在擴充自派之勢力、前因鈴木總裁派集合、而蒙刺戟之床次一派、定於六日下午六時、在日比谷之陶陶亭集會、討論對策、於是對立狀態乃更顯明、其間種種搗亂必乘機發生、致關心本黨者甚憂慮此傾向、（四日電通電）</p>

<p>伏洛希羅夫在共黨大會之演說</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　海陸軍人民委員長伏洛希羅夫、在共黨第十七次大會辯論史丹林報告時所發表之演說、今日由各報批露、伏氏在聽衆商聲而長時之鼓掌與歡呼聲中登臺云、「本屆十七次黨大會在歷史上、實爲波爾希維克之恊力一致與夫社會主義偉大勝利之第一次大會、列寗逝世已屆十年、其有歷史價値之工作重担、用爲其門徒·其友人·復爲其忠實信徒之史丹林氏所肩負、史氏以不屈不移之精神、剖解空前之巨艱、同時高揭列寗之旗幟、領導吾黨與無產階級以及蘇聯人民爭取新的勝利、吾黨之恊力同心、不僅今吾人之社會主義工業·集體農塲·國防系統·交通組織·以及敎育制度等等之建設、有急劇之進步、同時復能使勞動羣衆益形團結與鞏固、在物質及精神方面、將蘇聯全國國民加以組織、而使吾國之國際地位蒙最有利之影響、吾黨之偉力以及其堅如磐石之一致、不僅已爲國際無產階級及友黨所重視、卽吾儀之階級敵人在其與蘇聯之關係中、亦不得不對之加以考慮也、（首二段述農業與交通問題從略）</p>
<p>駕各國軍備凌</p>
<p>伏氏嗣述軍事國防問題、彼謂以中央委員會之經常注意、蘇聯武裝力量之標凖、已與全國發展之水凖相符合、在第十六次大會至十七次大會時期内、紅軍已經過澈底之改進、伏氏比較紅軍現狀及其在一九三○年之狀况時、則謂紅軍在技術改造上之基本問題、已告解决、目下吾人已有足數之新式坦克車、吾人已有質量俱佳之大砲、以及完全足數之優良機關槍、（包括輕的·重的·坦克用的·飛機用的·及商射機關槍等）、而此等武器均由吾國自製、吾人已有强大之化學工業、以及不算太壞之運輸工具、</p>
<p>空軍實力雄厚</p>
<p>一九三零年蘇聯所有之空軍雖不甚壞、但數量太感不足、當時空軍中各種空中武器之配置比例、不甚恰當、卽偵察機所占成份太商、同時並無轟炸機、卽驅逐機亦爲數甚少、然經過去之三年有半、空軍之面貌已且相見不相識矣、蓋吾人已創建强大之轟炸機隊、同時在其他航空戰鬥力上亦俱加刷新、</p>
<p>技術設備進步</p>
<p>伏氏復引用百分數及數字、說明紅軍技術設備之進步、其時大會聽衆均鼓掌、伏氏表示紅軍在性質上之變化時、謂紅軍所有之機械設備、士兵每人平均之機械力、在一九二九年爲二·六匹馬力、而現時則有七·七四匹馬力、</p>
<h3>增厚國防力量</h3>
<p>伏氏繼談及增强蘇聯國防之附次辦法、向大會指明現有之設防地帶、並不限於西部邊境、卽自拉杜加湖直至黑海、其在遠東及東部西伯利亞最受威　之區域亦復設置、彼復詳述蘇聯在黑海及波羅的海·在墨爾曼司克區·特别在遠東已積極增厚其沿海國防、伏氏謂此等防禦工作、將使企圖進攻蘇聯領土之冒險者感受困難、彼復述及海軍之增防、並力稱、蘇聯海岸綫延長數千英里、海軍實至爲重要、續稱、「過去數年内、吾人不僅已在波羅的海及黑海鞏固並增强吾人之海軍、並已派遣若干船隻橫渡波羅的海·白海·運河而赴北部、以補救北部之缺陷、同時進攻沿海省之直接威　迫令吾人在遠東亦駐紥海陸軍此際、予須聲明、吾人對於目下北方及遠東之幼稚艦隊、尙不能滿意、吾人在彼處並無海軍進攻之工具、如頭號軍艦及航空母艦等、唯世固週知吾人不欲以海陸軍向任何人進攻、吾人之所願者、乃在防衛吾人海岸與邊界、吾人自信吾人現時在此等處年有之海防軍力、（主要的爲吾人之海上航空及潛水艇）已足殱滅進攻吾人之敵人而有餘矣、</p>
<p>工業最大成就</p>
<p>伏氏述及工業時稱、强大社會主義工業之創建、爲勞工階級之最大成就、「吾國之工業爲整個國民經濟中最優秀之部務、同時又爲蘇聯全部勞動羣衆之驕子、至於軍需工業則已令軍隊有技術之改造、並供給優良的技術的武器矣、「波爾希維克之所以成爲波爾希維克者、乃在不囿於已有之成就、而恒能要求更大而更好之成績也」、</p>
<h3>作戰訓練純熟</h3>
<p>伏氏詳述紅軍之幹部以及彼等征服新技術之工作與特性、「吾國之軍隊已别具一格、因彼爲精通技術之軍隊、而其技術乃以自有之興趣·愛好·以及𤍠情而習得、此點得以下述事實表明之、卽在一桾三三年中紅軍人員所作技術發明及合理化辦法之建議、共逹一五二·○○○起、此等建議大部分均極有用並已順利採用、」伏氏續述軍隊戰術訓練之進步、士兵均已學得新法瞄凖術、且對其所用之武器有充分之瞭解、「唯吾人决不能以為吾人之成功已百分之百的完全、反之、吾人眼前尚有多量之工作、唯此際主要之事實、乃為軍隊在心理上興新的技術相固結、同時彼等乃將此種技術附　於其自身之意志、(红军組織概况)伏氏復詳述紅軍人員之社會的組成、而特別重視於工人人數之急激增加、彼謂工人興集體農民已佔紅軍人員之最大多數、彼　指明紅軍中共產黨員及青共團員之人數亦有增加、同時軍事學校處所之增加亦頗可觀、伏氏以嗣詳述軍隊中之多量文化工作、文化興教育機關之擴充、政治教育組織預算之巨量增加、以及俱樂部藝術團戲院及圖書館之增加時、則稱、「爭取社會主義的文化、爭取紅軍士兵及長官之文化的思考方法、以及為造成社會主義新人物之鬥爭、乃為軍隊中黨部興司令部之最高任務、」日本野心未饜</p>
<p>伏氏又涉及遠東局面、彼云、吾人再說明吾人在遠東之軍隊以及吾人為防患於未然計所行之步驟以前、予必須略述吾人遠東方面之鄰國、日本為首先揀中戰爭為解救危機之途徑之國家、已成眾人週之事實、彼在世界市場實為軍貨以及軍需工業原料之主要購買者、同時日本準備戰爭之政治工作、其備極周章、已成有目共覩、此種戰爭當較其向中國搆成者更為慘烈、過去數年內日本之軍事著述家·軍事新聞記者·科學家·工廠主人·公務員及政治家等、均公開宣稱日本對蘇聯作戰之必要、並常在文學興演說中以嘲笑興直率之態度、詳細討論佔領沿海省·外貝加爾區·甚至全部西伯利亞、在如此場合、吾人如仍欲令人深信吾人絕無所見、並一如昔日仍以吾人友愛之鄰伴為真實可靠者、則世人不將以為太可怪乎、日本今日已成滿洲之實際主人翁、不寗唯是、彼不懂不能循其所、並履行其義務、以保證蘇聯在中東路上之利益、甚且以全力援助滿方　　之、此可注意者卽日本之「商人」當其積極準備吾人進攻時、非唯不掩飾其行為、反向世界公然聲明、唯在同時彼等則味其良心、指斥蘇聯有進攻日本之軍事計劃、吾人在邊圉重鎮所設置之防禦工程、其為日人之眼中釘、固也、假如吾人於蘇滿交界處絕無防禦力量、一如一九三一年時中國之邊防者、則日本自能滿意、惜乎吾人之友愛决不至此、而予任何人以此種稱心事耳、</p>
<p>岌岌對俄備戰</p>
<p>伏氏乃詳述日本凖備戰爭之實况、彼謂彼等正從事於凖備經濟與軍事之根據地、武裝力量之改組、重整武裝以及其補充實力、最後彼等在滿洲積極建設練兵塲、所謂凖備軍事與經濟根據地者、乃包含自國外購進軍需原料、（此種原料爲日本所缺乏者）凖備其自有的工業及經濟組織、以及軍事預算自一九三○年之四四三百萬日金增爲一九三四年之九三七百萬日金、卽占本年預算總額百分之四四·五等等而言、建造坦克·飛機等之軍需工業正急迅擴充、日本之海陸空均在改編、重整武裝並增加額數中、伏氏對此復引數字與事實以說明之、彼續稱、凡此所述、已成舉世洞曉之事實、同時滿洲已漸成日本最有力之根據地、日本在滿之軍隊、已遠超爲「保護日人在此獨立國家内之利益」所心要之限度、唯滿洲軍隊與軍械仍不斷增加、</p>
<p>準備或有攻擊</p>
<p>舉凡此種與在滿洲及中國已經發生並繼續發生之事件有關之事實、迫令吾人不得不繼續執行防禦、堅定注意日本發生之一切事態、在國内採取心要步驟、並爲一切凖備也、直至今日、吾中央委員會首先如史丹林關於國際關係之聰明的政策、已令吾人脫離一切陰謀、並勿令吾人捲入戰渦、時至今日正如史丹林所謂吾人已爲全世界之和平因素、一切不願戰爭並不欲組成軍事集團之國家、不論其理由何在、其爲期長短何若、現已不得不團集於吾人週遭、吾人正如其主幹、周圍之國家正欲藉此以保證自身之避免進攻與戰爭、而此種進攻與戰爭、乃彼等所願或不能從事者、</p>
<h3>近東安全無虞</h3>
<p>史丹林在報告時已列舉各國而對吾人與各國之關係、作不偏不倚之評價、在近東方面一切均甚安謐、吾人與土耳其之關係最爲友愛而團結、吾人與波斯與阿富汗之關係亦稱不惡、至於吾人與歐洲鄰邦之關係、史丹林論之已詳、君等已熟稔之矣、</p>
<h3>遠東戰雲密佈</h3>
<p>遠東則層雲冪冪、戰爭之狂風暴雨、得瞬息爆發、吾人雖有外交家之努力、仍未能令日本當局了解和平勝於戰爭、同時對於吾人之戰爭、就日本帝國主義者而言、决非輕易簡單而小規模之戰爭、此項戰爭如吾人不獲已而參加時、必爲一巨大而慘烈之戰爭、同時此爲進攻波爾希維克之戰爭、而在目下條件下、此項戰爭將使發動者受創至深也、吾人遠方之鄰人固欲輕易犧牲他人、以獲厚利者、請牢記此事實爲宜也、（長期而商聲之鼓掌）</p>
<h3>開釁自取崩潰</h3>
<p>日本帝國主義者如决定發動此項萬分冒險而艱難之軍事冒險行動、則彼等必俟各方之凖備已經就緖、然後發動、故此項戰爭必形嚴重、然則假如敵人誠欲侵佔吾人之領土、吾人在令吾人工農紅軍在遠東邊界之前衛、卽遠東紅軍得以消滅彼等工作已進行至何種程度乎、伏氏遂謂在過去兩年内、且直至今日、中央委員會首先爲史丹林實不斷注意於遠東方面所盤踞、「吾人在該區已相當增厚吾人之武裝力量、恕予不能引述數字、吾人且已進行若干步驟、防禦吾人之遠東邊界、在更重要之地帶吾人已設置障礙物、令敵人不易跨入蘇聯領土、」</p>
<p>保衛尺寸領土</p>
<p>伏氏續述加强遠東國防之基本辦法、並稱以上予已以少數不完全之語句、說明吾國在遠東方面所做之國防工作、」伏氏復引用列寗在一九二二年日軍撤退海參崴後所作之聲明、卽「海參崴離此頗遠、唯該城爲吾國之城市、」伏氏續謂、此吾國之城市以及全部沿海省·北庫頁島·堪察加、總之吾人對於全部遠東領土之寸土、必須以任何代價防衛之、且必然的將能防衛之也」、</p>
<h3>最後勝劵可操</h3>
<p>語畢聽衆作商聲之歡呼、歷時頗久、伏氏續謂、「予知吾人全體（有如一人然）必能深信、吾人亦非唯將保障吾儕之遠東、且如吾人不獲已而加入戰爭時、必能爭取勝利也、吾人之敵人正作犧牲吾人以獲取勝利、同時以摧殘共產主義之甜夢、此事僅能以彼等無限之愚蠢與深切之無智、以及彼等已爲命途注定之事實解釋之、正唯彼之狹量與遲鈍、此爲資本主義命運必然之產物）乃能爲吾儕之階級敵人建議此種思想、吾黨與勞工階級以及蘇聯之全體勞動大家、已成偉大之力量、一種巨大之團結、一種强力以及一個有組織的戰士之軍隊、故吾人之建設工作雖有若干細微缺陷、然亦正如吾人旣已築成之大厦上僅有若干微細之破傷處耳、以後吾人將逐日獲得新勝利、同時不論發現於任何處所之蠢猪之咬嚙、均不能威嚇吾儕波爾希維克、或阻止吾人所向無前之進展」云、伏氏之結句爲高聲之歡呼所淹浸（四日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>明年之海縮會議</p>
<h3>廣田應付方針</h3>
<p>反對比率主義力避提及滿案</p>
<p>（東京）　廣田外相因排除一九三五·六年所謂之危機觀念、與陸海軍當局密切聯結、急於樹立對下次海軍軍縮會議之具體對策、其根幹如下、（一）「海縮之根本問題」華府倫敦兩會議採用艦船别之比率主義、該比率於見實方面、係减少列國之國防安全觀念、而有誘發競爭建艦之予盾、此事實證明比率主義之難逹軍縮目的、因此若眞欲逹到軍縮之目的、必須檢討新方法以代比率主義、日本根據足以保守兵力量之保有與國防地理的特種性之原則、必須主張總噸數之限制、與攻擊的艦船武器之質的限制等二點、（一）「滿洲問題」所謂滿洲問題者、已由「滿洲國」之獨立而解消、日本在下次軍縮會議、不論以何形式再審議該問題、皆所不容、（一）「南洋委任島問題」世界主要國經恊議結果、被委有統治權之日本、雖退出國聯、亦不應喪失其統治權、廣田外交以上列爲中心而展開、其如何發展、殊爲一般所期待、（四日電通電）</p>

<p>滿洲國」軍隊保護之下、敦圖鐵道遂得加工趕築、宣告完成、吉會鐵道之最初計劃、係以吉林為起點、經敦化至北鮮之會寗、九一八後、改變計劃、由敦化築至北朝鮮圖們江岸南洋洞對岸之灰漠洞、全長約計三百九十公里、經過遂道十三個及橋樑八十三座、其工作之艱巨、無可倫比、此鐵道之沿綫、雖無大都市、但未開發之可耕地、比之已耕地多二倍、旦沿綫擁有千年未嘗絲毫採伐之處女林、其面積之廣、蓄積量之多、則尤足驚人、但該路完成最大之價值、厥為縮短北滿至日本內地間之距離一點、該路西興吉長綫相連、直逹僞都長春、東渡圖們江鐵橋、興北鮮鐵道相銜接、滿鮮從此可以打成一片、至於日本內地與北滿之間距離、較　昔繞道大連時、縮短甚多、換言之、滿洲之經濟、以此路之完成而得到進一步之控制、該路之終端港問題、日人於此、亦頗費相當之研究、於吉會鐵路初期敷設之時、日人卽秘密測量、是時之定為終端港者凡三、卽清津·羅津·及雄基是也、其中清津雄基兩港、早已築成、惟羅津尚荒野一片、清津為北鮮第一商埠、人口三萬三千餘、一九三一年度之貿易額、逹一千三百萬元、然以其港內碼頭區之面積過小、及受高秣半島吹來之風浪與塞流之壓迫、且共海岸附近為輸城河流出之泥沙所淤積、欲築成碼頭、非加以鉅大之疏浚工程不可、故欲使清津成為吞吐千萬噸之終端港、自少可能性、雄基開港之歷史雖淺、然其發展頗速、人口約三萬、近年來　　　水　五千七百萬元、且接近港口有廣大之平野、水量劃由三江河供給、據　章云、可供　三萬人口之飲用、然此天然之良灣、亦具有致命之缺點、　其灣向東南、不足以禦　　、　在灣中難築防波場、　龍水湖爲内港、則冬季勢將結冰、故雄基之不能成為終端港、亦甚明顯、因此終端港之地點、非羅津莫屬、蓋羅津之給水雖稍困難、但較之大連、則其情形尚良好數倍、若一面於後山之北鐵柱洞引雄基流下之河水、一面更於西方五里之海豐築水提覆、則羅津之給水、卽不足憂處以形勢言、欲如羅津者、實不可多得、該灣深入內海逹十公里、大草小草二島屹立灣口、因之灣內風浪穩定異常、道開山石幅山等復環繞其三面、有若一天然屏障、景風之佳、較之大連、實有過之而無不及、然此猶以形勢及風景而言、若於商業及軍事上之立場觀之、則尤重要、記者於軍事一道、固為門外漢、但證之歷史上於日俄戰爭時、帝俄艦隊曾一度以此為根據地、及英之遠東艦隊三十年前會駛駐該灣、則其重要、自可想而知、若就經濟言、則其開始著手築港時、卽預定於十五年後完成九百萬噸吞吐能力之設備、較之淸津　　　　之　　力共八十萬噸、相　　不可以　　計、　較之大連今日一千一百萬噸、　　亦僅二百噸而已、</p>
<p>大連以二三十年悠久之時日、　　　之繁榮、則羅津欲興之對抗、固尙需相嘗歲月、但日本西北諸港與羅津問之距離、較之大連縮短、約逹一倍、自長春至日本東京繞道大連、約需七十小時、今則約須三十九小時、故今後滿北與日本内地之聯絡、將因敦圖路及其終端港羅津之完成、而更形密切可以斷言、</p>
<p>日人於二十七年前、卽以大連爲策源地、經營南滿路以奪取我東北之資源、致使我東北大陸、變易其顏色、今則日人更於其統治傀儡之下、以羅津爲策源地、築成第二條南滿路於我東北之東部、</p>
<p>此後我東北五百萬方里之土地、三千萬之同胞、益將陷於萬刦不復之境地矣、近來日蘇衝突之空氣、日益緊張、此間大有山雨欲來風滿樓之勢、是則日人之加速完成敦圖鐵路、趕築羅津港、其目的一方面固爲鞏固統治滿洲之政權與貫澈侵略東北之大陸政策計、一方面實爲應付此未來之大戰、非從速完成此軍事上佔有優勢之大動脈不可、國人遙聆敦圖路上鳴鳴之汽笛聲、應亦有所警惕矣、</p>
<h3>荼毒華北之日本毒品貿易</h3>
<p>節譯自日内瓦國際拒毒宣傳局的第二十一號文件中原著者爲亞倫氏（Ｅ·Ｗ·Ａｌｌｅｎ）中國人民、正在整個的被所謂日本商人酖毒着、為自己明瞭起見、我於最近作了一次澈底的調查、調查河北與山東兩省的麻醉品的販賣事業、尤其是海洛因的販賣的供給的來源、興夫中國人民患肺瘵的起因、以及毒品如何銷售、如何為嗜好者所吸食等、我的調查、發現了一些驚人的事實、那些事實、都是出任意表、使一般人很難置信的、以河北而論、銷售與消費總量之大、天津遠超出其餘諸城市之上、其次便要算與天津比鄰的北平了　　（一）沿街烟窟林立　天津日租界、差不多是天津市所有幹這種下流的販毒事業的中心地、法租界與日租界交界處、有一條秋山路、屬日租界所轄的那一邊、當吞雲吐霧的時候、便形成了致命的一幕活劇的表演地、從朝日路角起、到秋山路底止沿路走去、便可看到許多新式鋪面的屋子前面、陳列着光耀奪目的中文的、高麗文的、日本文的、金字招牌、在那些招牌上面、所書的都是華泰洋行等字樣、所有那些洋行、都是吸食由一角錢起碼零賣得海洛因的烟窟、從早上七點鐘起到夜半、只要隨便走進一家洋行　去、都可以看到中國人由人力車夫到販絲商吸着海洛因、有次、我順道走進秋三路三號、懸有華泰洋行招牌的第一家洋行裏去、那洋行裏的行主是高麗人、姓李、那洋行裏的經理、是中國人、姓王、他從姓李的行主那兒、每月領三十元的薪水、我走進去、發現了三十人以上的中國人在當前的間房裏吸着海洛因、經理立刻空出一把椅子給我坐、並拿約半公分的海洛因給我、向我索一塊錢、我坐下、裝著吸毒物神態、其時、有一中國人坐在我的後面、正睡著、穿的是一身很值錢的絲綢衣服、一醒轉來、看見我是個外國人、卽刻跑向門外去、經理却阻止他、並說我也是一個嗜好海洛音的人、於是這個中國青年笑了、他用很流利的英語問我、問我是否有嗜好海洛音的乖癖、當他聽到我的否定的答復以後、他太息了、他告訴我說、『我是天津本地人、二十一歲、我的父親是個小康的商人、我在京奉鐵路局的會計室做工作、大約是八個月以前吧、我覺得身上有點不舒服、我的朋友勸我吸一根含有海洛因的香煙、開頭一天、我吸了好幾枝、便真的病了、前天、曾經賣給我海洛因的那個高麗人、聽說我病了、他便向我的朋友說、他如果要完全恢複健康、還得要繼續吸食幾天海洛因才好、想不到聽了他的勸告、我竟染了這種不良的習慣、現在每日須花費三塊錢來吸此毒物、在我未習染成癖以前、我對於運動、是很有興趣的、並且好玩籃球、但是現在對於人生的一切、都感覺無趣味了、』　　結果、這個年輕人聽了我的勸告、去進醫院、住了四個禮拜後、他吸食毒物的惡癖、畢竟完全醫治好了、　　（二）用衣飾來換取海洛音　我所遇到相類似的事件、總以千計、其中包括有男女靑年學生、所謂日本商人、使中國人墮入殺中德方法、便是給中國人以海洛因、假如中國人的錢短少時、便要他們押當衣服或首飾、　　在北平哈德門街貼近的一座舊京都飯店的後面、便有兩層樓的專門作吸食毒物的一座大廈、業主是高麗人、他告訴我、在他那兒購買興吸食海洛因的中國人、最少亦有四百、在北平經營這項毒業的日本人和高麗人的鋪子是很多的、最顯著的地方、便是蘇州（譯音）胡同、所有這種毒業之成就、日本政府當然是參預共謀的、　　在山東濟南、日本居民約在五千以上、其中有百分之九十、自稱為商人的、是販賣麻醉藥品的走販、雖然山東省的當局、對於吸食和販賣海洛音的中國人、只要捉到了、卽處以極刑、但是在濟南已經為日本人傳授、為日本人騙誘、以致嗜好毒物成癖的中國人、當以千數、而這幾千的中國人卽已嗜好毒物成癖、他們不能戒掉不食、并且每日還繼續被騙誘而嗜好毒物成癖的中國人、亦不下千數、　　（三）不景氣時代　有一個販賣毒物的日本人告訴我、日本領事館的警察、對於所有販賣海洛因的日本人、全部認識、但是對於他們經營毒業、雖看見了、亦佯為不知一樣、那個日本商人又說、處此不景氣時期、日本人必須某得他們的生活、而販賣毒物、恰是就有利益的經營、日本人在山東之很有勢力　我眞是不勝差異、在濟南有一個受雇傭的日本人、他的薪水、是由公安局發給、他所幹的事情、則是照顧日本人的利益、和處理中國人與日本人間所起的爭端而已、　　沿膠濟鐵路一帶、差不多每一市鎭每一鄉村都住有日本人、那些日本人中、有百分之九十九是販賣麻醉藥的走販、他們強迫中國人吸食毒物、強迫中國人自己毒死、此外、他們又很殷勤的告訴中國人吸食毒物、使中國人習染成癖、在滿洲、日本的戰鬭利器、曾殺害了成千萬無辜的中國男子、中國婦女、以及中國小孩、再又刦掠了成千成萬的中國人民的家產、使他們迫於飢餓、在華北這一帶地方、日本人又大施屠殺成千成萬的男女、不過并不用槍砲、而是用的佷緩和、而又很可靠的武器、假如日本人這種毒殺中國的野蠻行爲再不停止、再經五年以後、華北的靑年人民、將有半數以上、要受其毒殺、而另有四分之一的人民、雖未毒殺而死、亦不過是無用的廢物而已、我（亞氏自稱）想、現在是採用種種步驟、制止所謂日本商人的這種毒殺中國人的野蠻行爲的時候到了、假如他們（日本人）在中國領土内不幹正當的營業、卽使他們是受治外法權所保護的外人、亦應從中國境内驅逐出去、世界上没有一個國家能够有一分鐘容忍這種販　商人居留的、</p>
<p>（四）學到新的壞樣中國人是愛好和平的國民、因爲他們有好客的性情、卽是一個生人、亦易納於上賓、因爲他們願意學樣、卽是一個陌生人的敎言、亦容易聽從、這就是那些所謂日商人能够誘壞中國人、使中國人嗜好毒物而有很大的成功的主因、</p>
<p>在華北、差不多所有的海洛因都是從在連棶偸運出來、然後假道天津和靑島的、據可靠消息、說是日本人在大連有好幾家製毒廠、并且每月售賣海洛因之毒人致死、遠過於鴉片、吸食海洛因成癖一次的人、要想戒掉再不食海洛因、是非常難能的、我與嗜好這種毒物的人談過話的、總有數千人、但我决没有聽到說過、一個人吸食海洛因上了五年、還能生存的、那此同我說過話的人、全都告訴我、說是他們全都是日本人和商麗人、告訴他們嗜好成了習慣的、所有海洛因的供給、都是來自日本人和商麗人、他們全都誠懇的表示他們的願望、只要有方法戒掉不食海洛因、他們是樂從的、</p>
<p>有此烟窟裏、我還看到父父子子一塊兒同着食日本毒物、在天津、我也見到一個人把一些含有海洛因的捲烟、給他的一個十三歲的兒子吸、</p>
<p>各種職業界的婦女、都是常跑進烟窟裏去吸食毒物、我看到有許多美貌艷妝的女子、不過十五歲上下的年紀、好們都食着海洛因、他們還告訴我、幾個月前、她們就染上了食毒之癖的、她們面色死白、她們的神經衰弱、她們中、還有兩個女子、約兩小時内、要食三公分以上的海洛因、</p>

<p>皖省公路已完成三千里</p>

<p>我自已似乎覺得自已是一個强毅勇爲的人，對於讀書是富於理解的能力，對於各種問題常常不怕艱苦地獨自去玩索尋味。我在現實社會經濟勢力的支配下，從文盲的陷阱裏爬到智識的領域來，在别人也許視爲平凡的事，可是在我已經是不斷的掙扎的結果。在中學的過程中，我終於被經濟封鎖着，從此和學校敎育絕綠了。當時我似乎有些憤慨和感歎，但後來却逐漸地認識了現代學校敎育的本質。我知道學校是爲多數紈袴子弟的俱樂部，剩餘價値的消費所，和淸寒學者的託庇處，國家施政上的一種點綴品。像我這樣的人有什麽條件可以參加這種塲合呢？</p>
<p>嚴重的環境威脅着我，生活的苦悶刺激着我，時代的巨輪動盪着我，生命的潛力督促着我，使我不得不希望奮發有爲，終於向着自學的一條路上走。然而，當前便有請大勝　　　着我··第一是我没有　　相同的題友可以互相研討。第二是我經濟的力量太　　，不能購買一些自學的工具書籍。更　了自身的經歷太淺·認　文　糊，將怎樣能够决定自學的目標呢？</p>
<p>爲了生活·剝奪了我的時間；爲了生活，擾亂了我的思慮··更且我本來就缺乏强固的身體，不能過分用功讀書（　　不是養生）和愛措身體，實在是怕病了無錢可以　治，將因此加速地毁滅了自身。）這又將怎樣自學呢？</p>
<p>於是我在可能的範圍内掙扎，我因着没有朋友，生活感着枯寂，偶然讀到一些文學的書籍，使的獲到了同情和共鳴，内心感着一陣歡欣和快慰·逐漸地使我注意作文技術的修養，我内心的悲痛和寂寞，迫着使我寫文章，來舒洩胸間的憤懣，弔慰寂寞的心。這樣的緊積下去，使我對於文藝更深一層的認識與了解，激起極大的興味。</p>
<p>近年來因着國際間的騷動，我們的民族和國家日趨衰落和崩潰，各種政治學說，錯綜紛紜，風起雲湧，我們的社會是亂絲一般的糟我們的前途是漆一般的黑，然而，我覺得這種現象决不是一時釀成的，當然有許多的遠因和近因。的因着要明瞭社會演進的軌跡而去讀史，要求了角現代社會的機構而去讀社會科學的各種論著，逐漸地使的得到一些概念。</p>
<p>以上便是我自學的經歷。總之，的的讀書並不是預定了什麽目標，什麽計劃，却是由於環境的壓迫和生命力的衝動，就可能的範圍内獨自去努力。我的讀書的態度是具着三種原則··第一是發展我的個性，　應的的情趣，培養我所長的才能。第二把自我的意識和力量隨時設法供獻給的們的社會。第三滿足我生活的需求（我没有過分的享用慾，這當然不是指極度的奢侈生活。）改善我的環境。我不能學着許多堅苦讀書祗間耕耘不問收穫的學問家；我却也不能學着一般功利主義投機取巧爲生活而學問的行徑。我誠摰地希望你們能給予我一種糾正和指導，我更希望你們能指示我一個更有效的方法和步驟，李思齊</p>
<p>我們很珍貴李君這樣艱苦的讀書經歷，所以，雖然來信很我們同意與欽佩，幾乎再無其他的話可說了，現在郤仍將來信公佈，這不過藉以鼓勵其他的讀者，不必灰心，李君就是一個從「文盲」奮門到「能讀」「能寫」的成功的人．可以作我們的模範的。</p>
<p>然而。在李君的來信中，更證明了本部「指導」的原則與一般學校的不同，是正確的。諴如李君之言「我的讀書並不是預定了什麽目標，什麽計劃，却是由於環境的壓迫和生命力的衝動，就可能的範圍内獨自去努力。」這話如果解作一面爲生活掙扎，一面去努力學識的追求，這完全是對的。但是，在這一面學習的範圍内，郤不能不預定目標，樹立計劃。因爲這有限的時間更不宜濫費，可保貴的精力，更不能白用的。這一點，我不僅希望李君注意，也希望一切自學的朋友不要忽視。本欄幾次討論到「讀書計劃」，注意自學的目標，都不是在空談，而是與實踐生活緊緊相聯，在一種艱苦的掙扎中，靜默而堅忍的學賢一點生活的知識，以便參加今日繁複的社會生活，不爲惡勢力所征服，而漸漸進入有前途的光明境界。</p>
<p>說到讀書的態度，本欄已經提示過多次了。來信中所說的三種原則，我們覺得還有商量的地方。</p>
<p>李君的態度太偏重「個人」方面了。如果照李君的態度做下去，第二項目的不見得能够逹到。就是，你從個人出發所學得的東西，未必能貢獻社會，社會未必需要它。我們以爲··在「個人」的條件以前，還得以社會的實踐，時代的要求作爲前提，因爲社會的目的，同時也是個人的目的，而且，人的目的來惟有在社會的目的逹到之　　可逹到。所　「　性」，「　　」</p>
<p>，「才能」和個人物質的「需求」　只能佔　前提下的一個國緊，不能成爲唯一的條件。</p>
<p>所　最「有效的方法和步驟」，最好請你再仔細檢查你的生活的實踐，作成以後研究的計劃罷、我們以爲··你旣然讀書不少了，你儘可從書本跳出來·張張眼睛看看中國的實踐罷你從還現實中，可以學更多的東西，同時它可供你　艱的研究的材料。由讀書而實用本是　　的順序呀、</p>

<h3>光陰的估價</h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>光陰的價値，當然各有貴賤，不能一槪而論，「寸陰尺　」在大</p>
<p>禺的眼光夢，便這樣値錢。甚至三過家門，不　生入，着得在官的時間，何等重要。所以他能在短的九年裏，把泛濫全國的洪水朝宗歸海，成就了不朽的功業。</p>
<p>其次，便要想到我們這位「運　習勞」的陶侃先生。他是更進一步，愛惜「分陰」的實行家。所以能成一代名臣，至今受人崇拜。</p>
<p>再看看現代的名人；什麽一秒鐘收入一百金洋的煤油大王哩；一畫夜工作二十小時的鐵血宰相哩；他那光陰的値錢，也就逹到了登峯造極的地位，不能再貴了。</p>
<p>只有我們貴中國的主人翁，對於光陰的價値却要換一種估法；</p>
<p>金迷紙醉，酣歌狂舞的塲合裏，「春宵一刻値千金」，價値也着實不賤。撲克一塲，麻將八圏，雖然費時不少，却也多少値幾個錢，不能說他是耗廢光陰的懶漢。</p>
<p>至於不分畫夜，拉攏要人之門，專車飛機，奔走仕宦之路，那更是「今之賢者」。足以媲美前哲，傲視國人的大好老，光陰當然很貴。</p>
<p>嗑嗑瓜子兒，聽聽大鼓調，日圖三餐，夜圖一聽的朋友們，醉生夢死的虚擲了一世光陰，似乎很不値錢；但你給他計算計算，衣食住行一輩子，也有很可觀的代價呢。</p>
<p>所以綜合起來，估計現代中國人的光陰，未嘗不値錢。所差的是「化錢買光陰」而不是把「光陰賣錢」。因此人家的光陰，越久越文是，我們的光陰，越過越糟糕。</p>
<p>「王小二過年，今年盼明年，一年不如一年」，事情就壞在這「盼」字上了。爲什麽要「盼」呢？馬上就「幹」不好嗎？只盼不幹，當然要一年不如一年了。</p>
<h3>辣椒與橄欖</h3>
<p>— 碩峰</p>
<p>如果把辣椒與橄欖連綴起來說。我以爲最好是拿來象徴男女的愛情。辣椒的味兒在「當下時」。其來勢凶猛毒辣，一下子便呌你口舌都爲之麻醉，生極痛快之感。但吃過之後，絕無弦外之音，無餘韻可尋，橄欖的味兒則在「</p>
<p>後頭」，起初也許味同嚼蠟，幾乎要逼着你吐棄掉，但吃到後來越吃越有味，吃後尙覺津津然回味如飴。</p>
<p>男子的用情好比辣椒，劈頭便是𤍠烈的。誰都會在初戀時期用坦克車式的猛力包抄自已所傾心的女子，任何丢臉没氣骨的事情都在女人面前做得出來，及至伊到手以後，其𤍠力便急劇的下落了　、這是直線式的奔放的感情，味兒雖濃而暫，女子的用情好比橄欖，開始總是沉默的，伊在初戀的時候，也許要給你幾次釘子碰，左也不行，右也不行，及至允許你以後，其勢力便蒸蒸日上了。這時曲線式的廻旋的感情，味兒雖淡而永。故在結緍以前，是女子享受男子辣椒式的辣味的時期，結婚以後，是男子享受女子橄欖式的回味的時期，故聰明的男子最好是多結幾次婚，不怕女子不　服你老爺··聰明的女了最好是結婚不婚不怕没有男子來伺候你小姐。</p>
<p>漫話漫晝</p>
<h3>心理實騐</h3>
<p>— 錢澐作文棟良作畫</p>
<p>走江湖的眞有意思，他看透人的心理，知道凡是要人家的錢入自已袋裏，非拿出「好看」來不可··呑劍雖說要錢不要命，但若非臉漲紅，筋狠起，涎直流時··他們誰肯化錢？</p>
<p>尤其中國人的脾氣，當他人痛苦時自已才痛快，你說遺話過份嗎？最顯近些說吧··路上見人跌倒，就拍手笑，有誰去扶上臂，隔壁火燒，若非恐延到自已時，他眞的會在牆上烘年糕吃、</p>
<h3>聽不聽由你</h3>
<p>— 流星</p>
<p>有人說：舞女�里是嫦娥，白尺晝是活鬼。妓女難道不是如此</p>
<p>有人病了，才𣇈得怎樣是會病的，用怎樣的方法去治。但，國病了，我看在咱們貴中國，實在沒有醫國的妙手。</p>
<p>世界上愚魯的，卑賤的人民，就是平民。現在最快的人，就是喜歡說實話。</p>
<p>弱者的苦笑，無代價的兌換到冷嘲和熱罵。拋錢給窮人的富人，他的價值比不上把同情給與他們的窮人。人與人之間的紛爭，逃不了個迷字。反之。就是悟字。</p>
<h3>有趣味的小新聞</h3>
<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>最難得到的親筆簽名或親筆信函，是　　敎王，意大利首相墨索里尼，美國飛行家林白大佐，和瑞典藉好蘭電影明星葛蘭泰嘉寳。</p>
<p>世界上最小的人，是巴斯尼亞地方的土人，年紀已有六十多歲，身體郤只有十九英寸半長，靠種田過活，屢次有人請他去表演，他都拒絕。</p>
<p>根據前一年的調查，潛水艇的數目，以美國爲最多，共有八十二艘；法國次之，計有八十艘，（但是將再製造二十九艘）··日本又次之，計有六十艘··英國又次之，共計五十三艘··意大利最次之，只有四十六艘。</p>
<p>在羅馬尼亞，兵士警士大中小學校裏的寄膳者，都不准吃白麵包，祗能代以裸麥麵包和一種玉蜀黍所製的硬粥。假使下年是豐年，這種禁令卽可取銷。</p>
<p>在美國香料的用塲最最廣，每年香料，香水沐浴鹽等商業，總計有六百萬英金鎊。有許多推銷汽車的商人，在他們的汽車中，灑有上好的香水，以引誘女主顧。</p>
<p>柏林醫生所乘坐的汽車上，現在要多裝一盞燈。這盞燈是在綠色底上顯出一個紅色十字架來，這樣，路上偶然發生什麽岔子，需用急救的，警士見了裝有這燈的汽車，便可敎他停止，馬上把應受急救的人送進去，請醫生施手術，可以節省不少時間，對於人命的安全，也有不少帮助。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十四回</p>
<p>酌酒傳餐狂歡</p>
<p>挑燈温夢低唱</p>
<p>趙自强勉强的放出苦笑來，點着頭道；可不是嗎？帶家眷的，也多着呢。桂枝手上，依然揑着那一張電報紙，向趙自强看看，又向母親，江氏看看，却没有作聲。江氏一昂下巴　，天想歎出一口氣來，但是看了他女兒那種焦慮的樣子，立刻把那口氣忍了回去，却没有吐出聲音來。趙翁道；電報上没有提到别的事情嗎？說着，瞪了兩隻眼珠，向兒子注視着。自强已知道他的用意，便道；没事没事。寳營長總是離不開我，一點兒事也不肯和我担担子，我在家裏再住兩三天，也没什麽關係，只是讓他在營裏找急，我心裏過不去，趙翁摸着鬍子道；那是呀。寳營長待你像兄弟一樣，你不能讓寳營長着急。</p>
<p>固然，你們新婚，應該在一處多盤桓幾天，可是同諧到老，將來的日子長着呢。趙自强皺了眉道；公事自然是要緊，只是這日子實在也快一點。他父子兩個，這樣一問一答的說着，江氏母女在一邊呆的聽、並不作聲。趙翁看到他二人並不搭腔，覺得只管說下去，也没有什麽意思，因之伸起手來，不住的摸着自已的長鬍子。趙自强看到父親那樣受窘的樣子，只管附和着父親說話，也是顯得無聊，於是偏過頭去，連連咳嗽了兩聲。趙翁手上摸了鬍子，眼睛可就向桂枝望着，只看他眼睛那樣凝注着，可以知道他是很關切的等着桂枝的回話。桂枝因爲公公的眼睛射在身上，也未便再裝麻糊，於是側轉臉向江氏掁着道；媽，自然是公事爲重呵。說畢，然後將臉來對自强望着道；今天還有一班長途汽車進城，我替你收拾行李罷。（二三八）</p>
<h3>嚴陵瀨放棹</h3>
<p>— 龍愚</p>
<p>離開了楊柫作岸的嚴束關鎭，還是淸晨六點鐘的薄寒天氣，和軼提了旅行皮包，忽忽地走下高低不平的石埤，就有　春江　停泊的漁艇，被一個少年船娘用櫓搖了過來。伊只是睜眼在瞧陌生的客人，没有說話。</p>
<p>「是陳姓的艇子嗎？」帙有着江南人的國語問伊。</p>
<p>「你們不是去嬉釣臺的？」伊出問我們。却飛着會心的眼波。</p>
<p>然而我們不回答，看艇子靠埠，便一跳跳進了船艙去。其實在這樣殘冬歲暮的時節，還會有甚麽人到這兒來瞧七里　的凉天風景？我們昨夜從蘭谿搭了夜航船駛進嚴東關，上岸客人中，除了我和軼，全是農夫和小商人。</p>
<p>我們的艇子，就是刺破了白茫茫的晨霧，這樣宛轉地搖進了七里瀧來。烏龍山和南高峯，全埋在銀灰色的宿夢裏，只隱約露出淺淺的黛痕，商遠處又銜接了那種氛氤似的濕烟。</p>
<p>這七里瀧的晴波，藍得像明潔的水晶，有着鐘一樣的澄澈。瀧底的石子，一塊一塊平整地舗着；伏在艇舷上可以數出自已的髮絲。時常有一兩個玲瓏的鷗鳧，鑽出水面，倫眼看往來的船隻，櫓聲一近，它們若不是展翼向天飛；便一下子没入水中不見了。</p>
<p>我們是順流而下，趁水勢直駛巖陵山去，這一路的山是峭麗的，雅靜的，水是明潔的，迂迴的。黃湛湛的沙洲。白蕭蕭蘆花，全被在冬天的晴日之背景裏，多麽含蓄着詩情畫意、而且那七里瀧暫時没有來往的船，全被我們管領着、</p>
<p>這時候，漁翁一面搖櫓，一百替我們指點着河山的名勝，又告訴我們以嚴陵瀨下的鑪魚的風味。喲！這不是蘇東坡在赤璧所嘗的巨口細鱗的一類，而且漢光武的友人嚴子陵逃名所釣的鑪魚哪！問現在有幾個不想向戚友的逹官將軍鑽營富貴；而自願烟雨簑笠過一生的呢？</p>
<p>「那給我們提幾尾不行嗎？」我問他。</p>
<p>「好！等你們嬉釣臺去時，抛一下網就得。」他笑着答。</p>
<p>爲了被鑪魚這曼妙的名詞一慫恿，軼和我一樣··在嚥唾沬。他是憑舷去覓波上有没有過江的魚影。我又問漁翁··</p>
<p>「那末，這裏到釣臺還要多少路呢？」</p>
<p>「是已牌時分了，一出長澗埠，便到了。現在是藍水塢，只三里路呢」。</p>
<p>的確太陽的光，照着山，照着江水，照着我們；獨照不着船娘的臉。爲伊戴着那麽大的圓笠子。這太陽似乎是秋天一樣的暖，水没有照得渾，反而藍得加倍的明潔。</p>
<p>中午，靜極了。水上没有旁的船，山裏没有一聲啼鳥，我們也没有說話；像是太古的環境。和軼睡在艙面上，看天上的白雲飛過。</p>
<p>突然，那漁翁回過頭來，一百用乎指着笑聲地呌··</p>
<p>一客人們瞧，兀的不是釣臺嗎？」</p>
<p>立刻，軼也很快地坐起來，跟漁翁指點的地方一瞧，果然在蒼　的錦峯繍嶺裏，有一條山徑，像屈曲的銀蛇似的向山上游去。山好像並不高，在山麓紅樹裏，便見了白墻的祠堂，和山腹裏的鐵石色的釣臺。哦！我所夢寐的仙津！</p>
<p>只一箭路的水程，艇子就泊在釣磯的大石上。于是我抱着酒瓶，和軼急急地跳上岸去，拜揖一下高風千古的大漢布衣！一面回頭對漁翁說··</p>
<p>「莫忘了給我們打幾尾鑪魚呢！」</p>
<p>「知道了。····」那聲音漸漸遠了起來。</p>

<p>湘省小學敎育界之大風潮</p>
<p>敎職員爭出路形成兩個壁壘</p>
<p>敎廳堅要小學敎師用師範生</p>
<p>長沙通訊、湖南敎育廳長朱經農、現依照部頒小學規程頒布敎字第一五○二號訓令、從本年春季起、凡省立小學、市縣立小學、區立聯立及私立高級小學敎師、儘先任用師範畢業生、以實行整理小學師資、如是引起絕大風潮、長沙市縣小學敎師中之非師範生者、首先起而反對、於一月三十日、在長沙市敎育會開會、議决成立、「長沙市縣公私立小學校敎職員職業維持會」推舉林康庸希聖等十三人爲代表、組織維持會代表團負責進行一切、三十一日先往長沙市政府、與長沙縣敎育局請願、說明小學敎師、任用師範生、固屬正當、惟對於獻身小學界已歷年所、或經檢定合格與具有相當成績之人、豈能一槪棄置、要求在此項風潮未解决以前、所有縣立市立各小學、不得任意更動敎職員、否則發生糾紛、不負責任、一面向省黨部省政府請願、要求轉行敎育廳、收回成命、並通電全省各縣、呼級小學校敎職員、各自成立各該縣市公私立小學敎職員職業維持分會、作大規模的反對、同時省立一中、二中、一師等校師範畢業生、亦聯合向黨政各高級機關請願、擁護敎育廳實行整理小學師資、儘先任用師範生之計劃、主張凡非師範畢業之小學敎師、應根據部頒小學章程第七十八條之規定、考試檢定及格、方可於聘用師範生之後面聘用之、决不能以成績優良或辦學有年等空洞之詞、而任其混跡小學敎育界、如是湘省小學敎育界因爭出路、而形成兩個壁壘矣、形勢漸趨嚴重、朱敎育廳長、因恐外間不明眞相、乃對新聞界發表一種談話如次、「湘省小學師資、有一矛盾現相、據各縣督學報告、有小學畢業生、充當小學校長者、有小學肄業生、充當小學敎員者、而道士師公、裁縫木匠、高據講席者、亦所在多有、同時政府以巨額經費訓練師範畢業生、則多置諸閒散、屢次通令各縣錄用、皆以具文視之、上次敎育部吴視察員研因巡視各縣後、亦以深此現象爲怪、爲正本淸源計、小學敎師、自以師範畢業生充當爲宜、猶之軍官應以軍校畢業生充任、工程師應以工科畢業生充任一樣的道理談到整理、本人也知道困難、所以僅規定以省立小學市縣立小學、區立聯立及私立高級小學爲實施範圍、此四種小學、全省不過八百校、而全省小學、則有二萬三千餘校之多是規定整理之小學、在表面上不過小學校全數三十分之一、而實際尙有邊遠縣份十四縣、是准其通融辦理的、至於不合規定資格、而確有敎學能力與經騐之敎員、本人已决不任其廢置、上月已電請敎部從速頒定檢定規程、旋奉回電、不日公布、日昨又已電請敎部、哪部定規程、一時不能公布、准本省先擬暫行檢定規則、以免久延、此種敎師暫時除上述八百校外、尙有二萬二千餘校、可以自由延聘、相信並無重大困難、事在必行、决不變更、深望小學敎育界同人、共體斯意、相見以諴」云云、惟小學敎職員職業維持會方面、堅决反對尙不知如何了結也、（二月一日）</p>
<p>浙省敎育概况（三）</p>
<p>敎部督學　夏兩次之演講紀要</p>
<p>（五）關于初等敎育方面</p>
<p>該省最近學齡兒童總數、計二百四十萬六千零四十人、其中在學兒童僅得六十九萬八千一百四十六人、失學兒童約佔百分之六十以上（義務敎育之未能普及、可以推知、而又因各縣敎費困難、無力遵照部頒第一期實施義務敎育辦法辦理、自前僅能頒行設立鄕鎭初級小學辦法、現定每鄕鎭至少應設初級小學一所、作爲義務敎育初步實施之基礎、現全省一萬二千四百七十四鄕鎭中、已設初級小學鄕鎭之數、計有七千九百九十六處、約佔三分之二現全省小學之數、公立者七千五百六十九年、私立者五千五百二十一所、短期小學七十所、短期小學班一百七十四處、私　四千四百三十處、上列校數、未　需要尙須儘量增　方右期義敎之普及、</p>
<p>各縣市因面積合財力等之不同、故初等敎育之發逹程度、亦頗有差異、而繁盛之區、較之鄕僻質量相云頗遠、辦理内容最較飭者、當推各省立中學之附屬小學以及各縣市中心小學、前者全省計有十一所、分隸十一學區、後者在二十一年度、全省計有一百八十六所、此二種小學皆負有輔導與實騐之任務、故一切設施、均能作其餘各校之模範、</p>
<h3>（六）關于社會敎育方面</h3>
<p>該省省敎育經費中、社會敎育經費佔百分之十二五、而縣市社會敎育經費總數、亦佔敎育經費總數百分之十二·二五、均已逹到部定最低標準、但各縣市中、社敎經費所佔百分比、則　差不一、（自百分之六、及至百分之二十二、）其中未逹部定標準之區域、計有一市十三縣、</p>
<p>民衆學校現有二千三百七十所、共二千九百零四級、較之去年度敎育廳訂頒各縣市辦理民衆學校敎育最低標準内所定之全省三千零五十級、尙差二晨級、其設施由中小學兼辦者多、敎師亦多係兼任、效率未能顯著、本所度試行專任制度、規定各縣除兼辦之民衆學校外、每學區須設置縣立民衆學校一所、或中心民衆學校一所、此制推行未廣、專設者仍未能多見、</p>
<p>民衆敎育館已設立者計有百零五館、正在進行、尙未成立者、有二十八館、距計劃設立之四百十五館、約差四分之三、此外圖書館通俗講演等事業、亦頗能注重、</p>
<p>民衆學校之辦理、較爲切實消除文盲之成績、亦有相當之表現、惟民衆敎育館、除少數外、尙多趨重形式與民衆少接近之機會、此種現象乃全國之通弊、不僅浙江一省爲然也、（完）</p>
<p>馬烈克由定縣赴平</p>
<p>（天津）丹麥學者馬烈克、參觀定縣實騐區、現已竣事定五日下午離定縣赴平六日起應燕大師大淸華北大各校之邀、依次講演、在平不多逗留預定本月中旬南下乘輪赴美、考查該國敎育、卽行返國、（四日中央社電）</p>
<p>本埠</p>
<h3>經濟不景氣中私校學生本學期减少</h3>
<p>普通家庭子女已無力求學</p>
<p>年來經濟恐慌、各業均不景氣、學校亦受影響、本學期本市各校均已開學、據上海社記者向一般學校調查所得、本學期私立學校招生結果、較上學期學生數量、减少三分之一之多、中途輟學者、比比皆是尤以中等學校爲最、市立學校以繳費較少、故報考者反較踴躍、惟限於名額、有志而無力升學者、仍抱向隅、故望敎育當局務須設法一方增設市校、一方减少私校學費、使普通家庭子妇不致受經濟恐慌、而中途退學也、</p>
<p>市敎育會今日召集公私立學校校民會議</p>
<p>上海市敎育會以本市公私立學校大半租借校舍、而年來房租昂貴、影響敎育前途至鉅、經分别調查、辦理登記、並定今日下午一時、召集全市各學校校長、在大吉路該會所舉行會議、討論减低房租進行辦法、</p>

<h3>埠際足球二次試賽各個表演精彩滿意</h3>
<p>雜色先勝結果三三和局</p>
<p>東華球員缺席觀衆减少</p>
<p>上海埠際足球、第二次試賽、昨日下午在申　舉行、兩隊以白色雜色分别之、以三比三和局告終雙方表演、俱臻佳境、形勢尤見緊張、興趣堪稱濃厚、惟以東華五球員之缺席、普通席中、寥寥不過、二二百人、而特别座仍告客滿、當在二千人以上、對於各個之技術、尙表滿意、將來埠際賽之前途、或許上海有一線希望也、</p>
<p>東華缺席精彩不减</p>
<p>東華五人、將不參加試賽、旣見報端、西聯事前、已有凖備、加以徐亞輝在厦門未返、柯萊脫臥病未愈、兩隊共少球員七人之多、除以預備員福祿壽與茂林兩人　補外、另以華塞斯之康潑頓、衛　生、及西捕之惠司和、法商之華特、及西商之金勃、旣凑足人數、惜福祿壽上塲不數分鐘、卽受傷離塲、於是白隊、祗得以十人應戰、下半時乃再以華塞斯之瓊司充白隊球門、雖然如此、表演並不因東華五人之缺席而减少其精彩、個個賣力、蓋列席之球員、固皆海上沙塲老將、其各個技術、已無庸介紹者也、</p>
<p>表演工夫···各有千秋···</p>
<p>論形勢、白色隊因上塲傷守門、吃虧不少、康潑頓調守大門、前鋒只餘其四、自然雜色隊佔居上風、亦足見白色隊之守衛嚴密、以整個球隊言、白色之工夫與聯絡、前在雜色之上、赫巴特之守門、不慌不忙、尙稱滿意、陶樂威之後衛、滿塲飛奔、與推納甚能合作、許德史篤克相形不如、兩方之中衛線、皆甚出色、亦爲最滿意之所在、上塲之二十分鐘、軋許銳氣方盛、八面威風、入後則漸衰、能奔能跑、始終如一、爲史密斯之長、雷米迪考司泰、左右兩柱、前鋒之中、鍾勇森大出風頭、奔走如飛、其不少美妙傳中之球、全塲稱贊、家球球路尙佳、阿巧甚賣力、一如常態、衛根生與華特、皆露軟弱、培特力大而敏速、孫錦順碌碌不能出人頭地、茂林康潑頓之中鋒、難分高下、將中鋒人才尙須考慮也、</p>
<p>白隊不利</p>
<h3>···失門傷出···</h3>
<p>裁判員樂秀榮鳴笛集合、白隊先攻、雜色中堅軋許、左右指揮、輪送前方、球如砲彈、白隊在其猛攻之下、忙於應付、傑美華特、飛送不少之妙球、向中央而去、孫錦順得惠思鳥高傳、　洶然帶球深入、陶樂威回身不及、後防　無一人、本可一　卽得、不料孫氏發腿、彈在福祿壽之身、爲透納救出、鍾勇森反窺無效、華特禮尙往來、在三十碼處斜刺射來、福祿壽救球心急、與培逹互撞倒地、球雖出險、而福祿壽已血流滿面、負傷出塲、</p>
<p>雜色施威</p>
<h3>連中兩球</h3>
<p>白色隊先折大將、不吉之兆、中鋒康潑頓、調回看守老營、乎生脚硬、危機四伏、鍾勇森在狂濤駭浪中、猶能不脫其英雄本色、時時予對方以重大之威脅、色隊有隙可乘、惠司和中路興師、培特帶球趕到、低綫橫身一掃、康潑頓躍起用乎、雖着球、而來勢太猛一滑脫手、金勃一頂而進、白隊卽下令反攻、小鍾帶球、連過三關、傳入中央陳家球、候着卽射、彈許脫之身、免却大禍、無何鍾氏、又抵對方腹、地傳入中路、阿巧漏脚、四座嘆氣、未幾小鍾兩度以極佳之傳中、均被阿巧輕輕斷送、華特邊陲張月、陶樂威智者千慮、竟將球向本方門前橫傳、透納踢之不遠、軋許見機而作、對門力搗、康潑頓倒地救球、却不防培逹乘勢一撥、乃徐徐滾入門内、成二比零、</p>
<p>變更戰略</p>
<h3>···家球頂進···</h3>
<p>白隊連負兩球、殊爲一般意料所不及、前鋒祗以四人應戰、進攻力量、不無遜色、在此重壓之下、乃用奇兵突出之計、改用遠球輪送、鍾勇森在右角接應、使雜隊不得不調師防後、雜色之氣燄、仍未稍减、孫鋪順金勃東呼西應、康潑頓棄門奔出、金勃乃對空門射來、幸陶樂威快滑過人、頂成角球、未遭奇禍、上半時尙餘五分鐘、衛根生帶球直衝、回馬撥交阿巧、阿巧向右角一送、鍾勇森如飛而去、向門一脚、彈柱而回、家球跳起一頂、送進内、上半時成二比一之數、雜色佔先、</p>
<p>變化無窮</p>
<h3>···和局而終···</h3>
<p>觀者不忍見白隊之苦門、有大呼添人者、乃調瓊司入、充守門、康潑頓回任中鋒、白隊乃虎虎有生氣、衛根生與阿巧、皆以對角遠球、欲破對方之守衛線、家球在後、向左角衛根生飛送一球、衛還諸中央、康潑頓跳起一頂、赫巴特被撞倒地、鍾勇森乘勢輕輕撥入、遂成二比二之平手、秋色平分、各堅其守、相持不下、阿巧因足傷不能奔跑、方以　各二終局、不料最後之十分鐘中、又各中一球、色隊右翼培特、得球勢如奔馬、史密斯二關陷落、透納又糾　不得、球入中路、茂林　進數步、一蹴而入、隊又佔上風、白隊力圖振作、最後之五分鐘、衛根生在底線處、被許德所阻、卽傳興阿巧、史篤克來、截成角球、衛根生開球、恰巧在柱前落下、赫巴特一呆、球竟爲風送入門去、三比三平乎終局、</p>

<p>東華棄權問題</p>
<h3>該隊聲明苦衷但望力謀改善</h3>
<p>星期六東華對法商之西聯甲組重要比賽、東華於臨賽前宣布棄權引起足球界之特别注意、詳情已誌昨報、東華體育會昨特發表聲明書、對於棄權一事、略有剖白、前照錄原文如下、</p>
<p>東華聲明</p>
<p>體育編輯先生台鑒、日昨敝會對法商之西聯甲組賽、臨時缺席、此中綠由、雖在各大報略有記載、而敝會尙有不得不鄭重聲明者、此次敝會一則因隊員李寗無故受罰、停賽兩星期、二則因萬象華及主要之補充球員、隨交大球隊北遊、此外又有一二或傷或病、不得已於上星期一再函致西聯申情由請求改期、詎料西聯答覆、毫無誠意之考慮、一意孤行拒絶、所請嚴令履行聯賽之秩序云、遂使敝會進退維谷、且値錦標得失重大之一賽、焉肯甘心棄權、故於昨日下午兩時前、尙在各處奔走呼號、冀成一軍、以備决賽、不意事與願違、實屬無可集合、故至最後期間、只可宣告缺席、再敝會更有須申述者、西聯對於他方之請求改期、則有求必應、而於敝會從未邀准一次、此敝會所索解無從者也、至球事消息、向來借重各報之宣傳、並無中西之分、此次缺席、事前絕未與任何方面接洽、惟出倉猝、致使關心球事之各方仕女、空勞往返、敝會無任抱歉、諸希諒恕、爲幸、專此順頌撰祺、東華體育會啓、二月四日、</p>
<h3>亟應整頓</h3>
<p>對於「恐須棄權二節、不報告中國報紙記者隔夜之詢問、而獨宣佈於西報之上、以致引起多方面之責難而致事情益覺其嚴重、該會辦事之欠周到、實難令人滿意、以東華今日之地位、缺乏領袖人才、主持會務、實爲可惜、日昨之事、原因亦在此、如香港南華體育會之所以能爲全國最完美之集團者、以其組織完善、辦事周到所致、東華爲上海最有聲譽之足球團體、則亟宜謀徹底之改善計策、則將來之成功、未嘗非今日之　結有以造成之也、</p>
<h3>傳聞退出</h3>
<p>東華棄權以後、昨日之埠際隊二次試賽、被選球員亦不出塲、原因何在、不得而知、得據非正式之傳說、東華並將退出西聯云云、聞者無不爲之惋惜、無不爲之失望、查東華成立以來、已經三載、成績卓著、備受羣衆之擁護、不意其中途忽生變故也、然吾人所切望於不華者、不在退出西聯與否之問題、而在於東華内部今後之如何改進耳、</p>

<h3>談白濁菌</h3>
<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>白濁菌是屬於球菌的一種雙球球菌，因爲吾們的細菌可以大别爲三類··卽球菌，桿菌，及螺暶菌是也。這三類的區别，全然是依着牠的像形而來的，白濁菌是球菌，又因牠的排列是一對一對的連着，故又稱之爲雙球菌，牠雖是球菌，但是牠的眞形並不是正圓，而反呈扁狀，故其實在形狀，好像一粒『加非荳，』二粒『加非荳』連在一起，是吾們在顯微鏡下看得牠的形狀。</p>
<p>這白濁菌是一種所謂黏膜的寄生病菌，因爲牠的侵入人體，終由黏膜處侵入，人的黏膜如有破傷，那麽這白濁菌就得到好機會了。侵入之後，牠就顯牠的作用，牠把菌體内之害素滲入人的細胞之内，細胞受了牠的毒害，身體中的常備抵抗的白血球，就好像得到了動員令一般的直向那毒聚之處前進，把傷害之地位處，四面八方的圍起來，在細菌所在之中局，那些白血球直接的與牠們角鬭，其結果卽各有死傷，用肉眼可見的就是流出來白濁，亦卽是膿，所謂膿者，卽角鬭之產物耳。</p>
<p>這首先由乃由氏（Ｎｅｉｓｓｅｒ）初次發現的白濁雙球菌，除了發和白濁症外，他尙可以侵入到心臓及腦膜裏去，那麽就可以成心臓内膜炎及腦膜炎等症，有時則由尿變黏膜，假借血流侵入到關節部份，而成白濁性的單關節炎。（所以稱他爲單的關節炎，因爲白濁性的關節炎大半只限於一個關節，不若其他的普通關節炎，常常同時發炎多數之關節。）在眼膜上的白濁，其病勢特猛，受病的人，往往會成瞎子，所以作者乘此機會警告白濁病家，碰過白濁流出液之後，切記勿要把手忘却了消毒手續，免得把白濁菌誤染入眼。所謂消毒，實在是很便當的一件事，只需用𤍠水及肥皂洗手而已，如能於水中再加些臭藥水等消毒劑則更好。但是並不是必需的，因爲這白濁菌確是在普通的空氣及物件上不多時卽會死亡，尤其是耐不住日光的效力。</p>
<p>說起了白濁眼痌就想起了在新法接生的產兒一下地卽須滴一點殺滅白濁菌的眼藥，滴入嬰兒的眼中，這個方法是克來台氏發明的。（Ｃｒｅｄｅ）從他的經騐，知道生白濁的產婦最容易得白濁菌染給他的孩子，因爲嬰孩的組織抵抗薄弱，得了此菌，差不多終成瞎子，其危險性是不必多說。所以自從他發明這個慈悲的方法後，不知在無形中救出了多少的殘疾，所以我禁不住的要把他來宣揚一下。</p>
<p>白濁菌侵入了人的組織之後，不是卽刻就會生白濁病，其中相隔有一定的所謂『潛伏期』，這潛伏期是二三天，（卽染菌後二三天後方現病象）如果把那時流出的膿液，用顯微鏡來檢查，就可以看見有許多形如加非荳的白濁雙球菌，被白血球吞噬在腹中。這白血球（就是人的常備兵）底所以能吞噬白濁菌，實在因爲白濁菌體上有一種類似調味素的物質，使得那些白血球大開其胃口，但是這所謂的吃菌作用，是只限於急性的白濁病。一到了漫性，那些白血球便不吃牠們了。吾人在顯微鏡下眼亦只見白濁菌散於白血球的四週，而不入其腹部，這也是一件奇怪的事件。</p>
<p>白濁球菌的檢出，是一件很容易的事件，吾人尙可用人工的方法來培養此菌，但是培養的手續較繁殖尤其困難。因爲該白濁菌不容易服帖生長在人工的培養基上，吾們做熟的人，那麽倒也不覺得如何困難，就可以使他發育並繁殖。</p>
<p>白濁菌的腹中含有一種所謂内毒素，Ｅｕｄｏｓｏｈｉｎ這毒素確就是最毒的菌體物質，牠的耐抗𤍠度的性質亦很强，所以用七十度的（攝氏）温度，亦不能消滅牠，亦可知其力量之猛烈矣。</p>
<h3>人體腸寄生蟲之危害驅除及預防（四）</h3>
<p>— 蔣本沂</p>
<p>（慈航助產學校亞洲中學講演稿）</p>
<p>腸寄生蟲傳染的路徑，不外是咱們底嘴和皮膚。明白地說，腸寄生蟲是從咱們底嘴裏或者皮膚裏跑進去的。所以要是咱們注意衛生，不把腸寄生蟲蟲卵，仔蟲吃進去，或者不使腸寄生蟲的仔蟲有接觸咱們皮膚的機會，那末腸寄生蟲雖是厲害，也只好歎着英雄無用武之地了。這樣看來，腸寄生蟲病雖是這麽普遍，這麽危險，只要咱們努力預防，當然可以避免的。現在把簡易的預防法寫在下面。</p>
<p>一，不吃生菜</p>
<p>咱們中國是用糞便灌田的，而糞便是腸寄生蟲卵的大本營，所以吃生菜是非常危險的。據陶熾孫敎授說，有一次他用一百西西的水，洗滌了三張菜葉；再把這洗滌過菜葉的水沈澱起來，便找到了五十個以上的蛔蟲卵，所以不吃生菜，是預防腸寄生蟲病的必要條件。</p>
<p>二，不吃生菱</p>
<p>生菱是　片蟲病的媒介物，蕭山　片蟲的流行，多半是由吃生菱而來的，所以不能吃。</p>
<p>三，不吃没有煮熟的肉類和魚類肉類和魚類往往成爲螩蟲的中間宿主，所以一定要煮熟了才吃，不然是很危險的。</p>
<p>四，不吃没有煮沸的水和没有洗乾凈的菓子。</p>
<p>五，飲食前後須洗手。</p>
<p>手是非常容易跟腸寄生蟲蟲卵和仔蟲接觸的，陶熾孫敎授曾經在娘姨底一個指甲上，找到了兩個蛔蟲卵，所以在飲食前，咱們非洗手不可。</p>
<p>六，腸寄生蟲病人底糞便應當消毒。</p>
<p>七，不可接觸有腸寄生蟲病病人底糞便。</p>
<p>八，種田和採桑葉的時候，最好避免赤脚。</p>
<p>十二指腸蟲病，農民比較的最多。</p>
<p>鄕間流行的所謂「桑葉黃」，就是十二指腸蟲仔蟲鑽進了採桑人的皮膚裏面而發生的貧血症。所以，在可能範圍中，農民應極力避免赤了脚種田，赤了脚採桑葉。</p>
<p>九，不可接近犬貓之</p>
<p>犬貓之類，往往也成爲　蟲底中間宿主，所以不可接近。</p>
<p>十，其他。</p>
<p>（五）最後的話。</p>
<p>這篇東西，曾經在慈航助產學校和亞洲中學先後講演過。講過的東西，本没有發表的必要，不過因爲咱們底同胞對於腸寄生蟲病太漠視了。甚至有人把蛔蟲認爲消食蟲，非有牠存在，吃的東西便不能消化。這眞是滑天下之大稽！因此，不揣冒昧，把這演講稿，略微修改了一些，換了個題目，借申報醫藥週刋發表。要是讀者從此獲得了腸寄生蟲病的智識，不再說出莫明其妙的怪言；甚至進一步地實行腸寄生蟲的驅除及預防，那便學得非常幸運了！</p>
<p>現在把慈航助產學校和亞洲中學一部分學生的糞便中腸寄生蟲卵檢查得結果，列表於下，略供參考。</p>
<p>學校　檢查人數　有蟲卵者　百分率</p>
<p>慈航　五十五人　卅二人　五八·一八</p>
<p>亞洲　二十　人　六　人　三十</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答（續）</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（二）（十）（四）肺結核</p>
<p>（問）肺癆病能不能完全治瘉？</p>
<p>（答）初期的肺結核，大概可以希望有治療效果的。</p>
<p>（問）治療肺結核的方針怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）治療肺結核，在乎使病人的身體能够戰勝病機，所以保護肉體和精神，多給營養料，最是重要。我們現在大都把空氣，靜臥，最光療法，和藥劑療法與及理學療法一同施行的。</p>
<p>（答）空氣療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）使病人生活於新鮮空氣中。若没有風的時候，可常開窗户。在没有發𤍠的病人，可令其散步。</p>
<p>（問）靜臥療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）凡有𤍠的病人，必須絕對靜臥。對於有輕微發𤍠的慢性病人或初期的病人，</p>
<p>這種靜臥療臥，最是適宜。</p>
<p>（問）日光療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）日光對於肺結核病，非常有良效的。</p>
<p>在山上高燥的地方，使病人每天曝臥在日光下一二小時··面部用黑布遮蔽，久之有效。但多雲多風的山間，不宜。</p>
<p>（問）肺結核病的藥劑療法，有没有確實的效果？</p>
<p>（答）藥劑療法，對於肺結核病，種類雖很多，但特效藥還没有發見，所以决無確實效果之可言。常用的是木焦油劑，像克列鎖類，但不過能使咯痰减少，促進消化；此外有用亞砒敵劑或燐劑，使病人體力增進的，普通大都行對症的藥劑療法··就是對於病人發𤍠，咳嗽，咯痰，盜汗，咯血，胸痛，呼吸困難，泄瀉，食慾减退，等，各别投與藥劑的方法。</p>
<p>（問）對於發𤍠的症療法，應當用些什麽藥劑？</p>
<p>（答）不外數種解𤍠藥，像非那西汀，匹拉米同，克利金，愛爾邦之類。其中尤以愛爾邦，最稱有效。</p>
<p>（問）對於咳嗽，用什麽藥？</p>
<p>（答）如果肺癆病人，咳嗽非常劇烈，甚至感到苦痛或妨礙睡眠的時候，可用燐酸科介因，等麻醉齏來鎭咳。</p>
<p>（問）對於喀痰，應該用什麽藥？</p>
<p>（答）凡喀痰黏稠，難於咯出的時候，可給以袪痰劑，像洋遠志根浸，吐根浸，　茴香精，松節油等。</p>
<p>（問）對於盜汗的對症療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在就寖前飲少許勃蘭地，加於牛乳或茶中服用。或行冷水摩擦，温浴，或皮膚塗頹酒精溶液。止汗劑可用樟腦酸，莨　浸膏，阿加利辛，或種種催眠藥都有效。如係頑固性咳嗽，可行高張性食鹽水，　化鈣溶液的靜脈注射，連續數天。（未完）</p>

<h3>舊醫新釋攻錯</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>晚光旣可分析。當然有各個特</p>
<p>殊之作用。而地面照射所及之光綫。因空氣中複雜關係。通過之際。或因屈折。而一部或數部被吸收。尤以吾儕注目之紫外綫。或可逹地面。或不可逹地面。而地面上吾人所希望之是綫。雖同受日光照射。而或竟不可得。則日光療病之目的。終不能逹。而所謂日光浴療法之價値。遂失其功能而等零。</p>
<p>肺勞病適需日光浴之目的。爲療病。而療病所要求之光綫。紫外綫也。此外一切日光中所含光綫。雖爲生理上必需。然非目的物。則吾輩於紫外綫之目的物。不可不使此要求滿足。而特加注意。於是有高山太陽療病之說。高山太陽。初非有異於平地也。不過其透過之空氣層中。少過妨礙光綫之物質。則固有之九種光綫。得以全數保存。紫外綫。當然爲其中之一。故得逹吾輩治療肺勞之目的。平地尤以都市日光之所以寡効者。非他。蓋爲此也。紫外綫。具殺菌能力。日光之所以能消毒者。賴此。肺勞病人之需要日光浴目的。亦貫注在此。故保存紫外綫。爲日光浴之目標。今平地都市之日光。因塵埃。煤烟。以及地面動物所產生之各物質氣體。混布空中。乃日光透過時。紫外線。大部爲其屈折而吸收。若再經玻璃之屈折。此綫作用。完全消失。故近今一班醫家理學專家。皆已確認透過玻璃之日光。已無紫外綫之功能。所以人工太陽燈。不用玻璃球管。而代以石英也。陳君僅知日光浴之可治肺。而不知所以能治肺。乃於其肺勞概論篇中。旣稱「高山最宜。距地面旣遠。光綫之强度。不稍受損失···若在地面之上。地上之蒸氣。不特折光甚力，並有一定光綫。被吸收化爲無有。光綫强度旣减，其消毒力。亦隨之俱减。···云云」似頗了解日光中有紫外綫。紫外綫可殺菌消毒之意。而忽於論中。賣弄聰明。畫蛇添足。參加已見。插入「施行此術時。首宣避風。能得一玻璃室舉行之。則爲最妙云云。「昧不知玻璃之亦可吸收紫外綫。而使之消失也。（現在美國新近研究得一種玻璃謂可不妨紫外綫之透過。然尙未見過）此無科學根底。至有此失也。深冀陳君參閱診療醫報五卷五期。不侫所草「述紫外光治肺須知」一篇。當可略知梗概。並希陳君。於今後下筆時。在科學實騐文字之外。勿　雜從來推想謬見。致使全篇文字。自生衝突。則幸甚矣。孔子曰。鄕愿德之賊也。願與陳君共勉之。</p>

<p>此外亦曾有法國及他國之科學家。先後進行相類似或極不相同之研究。按在範圍較小之某某處醫學界中所稱爲最時髦者。卽係Friedman之研究。該氏曾於一九○三年時提得一種菌苗。稱爲龜菌。至其功用。自經在天竺鼠身上屢次試騐之後。曾由Calmette醫士之助手。卽巴斯德研究院之化騐所主任Saenz醫士。認爲無效。按在上稱之各種研究中。應以RKoch氏之研究最爲有名。該氏實爲結核病黴菌之發明家。（此名稱應釋拉丁字原意）而意欲求覓治療藥品。該氏之結核菌注射液。（Tuberculne）並未如預備血淸之法。在獸身上經過遷種手續。而係直接以一種由結核菌得來之毒質注入人身。俾發生適當之「反毒體質」。嗣經騐明。實有危險。然將該注射液調和至極淡成分。通常可用以試騐各人體中是否帶有病根。凡爲兩歲以上之孩童。或成年人注射ＢＣＧ之前。必須先作上項試騐。蓋欲使預防藥之注射發生功效。必先騐得人體中在八日相間期内發現兩次陰性反應。若照技術觀點而論。其施行方法一如種痘無異。先用多尖刀在背後肩下三角筋部剌破。高下兩處。（勿使流血）其第一處謂之證明點。勿施菌液。其第二處則施以菌液一滴。稍加抺開。二日之後。如受苗人體中。確有病菌。則發現陽性反應。狀如浮腫紅斑。其圓徑可有一至三生的米逹。而其中心則有一紫紅色小胞。能發現至四日或六日不消。如人體中並無病菌。則皮色當台證明點平綫一帶相同。按此表皮反應。（名稱如此）最爲重要。若是陽性。亦不卽爲患有結核病之徴兆。而但證明人體中含有些須毒菌。且往往不能爲害而已。自成爲天然性的預防。然自一九二七年以來。結核病預防藥之爲用。在法國以及他國日益重大。蓋於一九二四年中。法國孩童之受注射藥者。不過八五○名。於一九三二年中。爲一二四七三七名。而於一九三三年之最先七個月中。爲八七○四四名。按在此種奮鬭中。法國之北省於一九三二年中獨佔注射數九八九五。故該省居首。且今以世界而言。已無一文明大邦之中。不设立一處製造預防藥之中心地點。而乃亦有設立至數處者。如德國則有ＢｅｒｌｉｎＬａｎｇｃｎｄｅｒｎｂａｃｈＢｒｅｓｌａｕ等城。俄國則有ＬｅｎｉｎｇｒａｄＭｏｓｃｏｕＫｈａｒｋｏｗ等城。意大利則有ＭｉｌａｎＢｏｌｏｇｎｅ等城。至於法國之大陸境内。則只有巴黎一處。但在ＡｌｇｅｒｉｅＴｕｎｉｓｅＭａｒｏｃＡＯＦＡＥＦＭａｄａｃａｓｃａｒ越南Ｍａｒｔｉｎｉｑｕｅ</p>
<p>等地。皆各自有其製藥之處。關於此節。非無原因。蓋欲保存預防藥之靈效。必須於該藥製成後十日以内使用。故無法自遠方遞送。亦不能日久貯存。或售作商品。凡在法國全境内所用之預防藥。皆向巴黎之研究院討取。凡爲注射新生嬰兒所用者。則由該院分贈。（不收費）全國之醫生或助產婆。其爲他種人所用者。則專分送與各醫士。該院永不以預防藥供給國外之用。而祇將ＣｏｌｍｅｔｔｅＧｕｅｒｉｎ菌本寄送與各同類之化騐所。因此項預防藥之配製。則皆由各地之研究院自行負責擔任。卽因有此一節故在結核注射治療法之鳥噉史中。曾經發生Ｌｕｂｅｃｋ城之慘事。幾使ＢＣＧ預防藥之信用完全失敗。蓋於一九三○年初。忽傳聞該城有曾受注射藥之嬰兒二百名。皆犯有急性結核病。而於數日之間其慘遭死亡者竟多至七十六人。嗣經德國之司法與衛生官府嚴加調查。不外卽查明該慘禍之所以發生。應由擔任配製預防藥之德國醫生負此重責。蓋此醫生以不謹愼之故。誤將由Ｋｉｅｌ送到而在同一化騐室中培養之毒菌混入ＢＣＧ菌苗之中。當時法國方面。立卽料及其中必有錯誤。對於此節。德國之官府及科學家亦皆加以承認矣。</p>
<p>自一九二七年以來ＢＣＧ預防藥賜予吾人之恩惠。</p>
<p>按實際而言。ＢＣＧ預防藥確是無害之品。已有數十萬次之試騐可以證明其絕對不能爲害。前者固曾有某某著作家。以無依據之臆斷。妄稱ＢＣＧ菌苗或有一日將能變有毒性而釀成結核病之禍害云云。然歷時旣久。此種臆說已經證明不確。且有前與Ｃａｌｎｅｔｔｅ及Ｇｕｅｒｉｎ二醫士最初試用結核預防藥之ＷｅｉｌｌＨａｌｌｅ醫士。曾在醫學研究院之週刋内。發表一篇極有證據之論文。其結論中稱。關於ＢＣＧ預防藥一則。吾人及ＷｉｌｌｉａｍＦａｒｋ氏已屢言之矣。其能在人體中退化或消滅之危險大。其能恢復原來毒性之危險小。故須於一定時期之中。查騐預防藥力是否依然存在。如已消滅。則須重得注射。在實際上凡各小兒皆於滿一歲及三歲時。重行注射。此後則於七歲及十五歲時。再施行之。但有人質問。ＢＣＧ預防藥是否靈效。關於此節已有悠久歲月予吾人以答覆。蓋關於此項問題。曾有肺病學週刋。及巴斯德研究院之週年刋。自數月以來發表各醫學經騐家之評論。皆稱凡已受注射之孩童。其夭亡之數較之未受注射藥者大見减少。此外尙有Ｑｎｉｒａｎｇ</p>
<p>ａｌｄｅＥｓｓａｒｔｓ醫士在Ｆｉｎｉｓｔｅｒｅ省中所作之試騐。最爲完全。而亦最有興味。按該省特爲不幸。其居民之有結核病者過多。而該醫士作試騐之地。又爲特受病毒而爲航海家集中點之Ｂｒｏｓｔ海口。據該醫士所已騐視之孩童。（不論是否已經注射）皆在有一或數結核病人之家庭中生活。今將該醫士自一九二七年至一九三二年之經騐統成績開列如次。（其中不算死產及生後一日至一個月以内夭亡之孩童。蓋以注射藥尙未能發和效力故也）。</p>
<p>一九二七的騐視之孩童共一八六名。屬於七十五家。新生時已受注射者七五名。未受注射者一一一名。自一歲至五歲中夭亡者。有已受注射者一名。卽百分之一·三三。有未受注射者二十六名。卽百分之二三·四二。（已受注射之孩兒係死於白喉。）</p>
<p>一九二八年騐視之孩童共三三六名。屬於一三二家。其中已受注射或已再經注射者一三七名。未受注射者一九九名。其自生後一個月至四歲中夭亡者。有已受注射者十一名。卽百分之八·○二。有未受注射者三十九名，卽百分之一九·五九。共已受注射者之夭亡原因如次。二名死於災禍。一名死於腸胃病。二名死於腦膜炎。二名死於百日嗽。一名死於疹子。二名死於氣管支肺炎。一名死於腹膜炎。</p>
<p>一九二九年騐視之孩童共三九○名。屬於一四九家。其中已經或已再經注射者一七六名。未經注射者二一四名。其自生後一個月至三歲時夭亡者。有已受注射者十四名。卽百分之七九。有未受注射者四十四名。卽百分之二○·五六。其已受注射者所以夭亡之原因如次。三名死於氣管支肺炎。二名死於災禍。三名死於腦膜炎。一名死於痢疾。一名死於百日嗽。三名死於腸炎。一名死於小膿疱疹。</p>
<p>一九三○年騐視之孩童共四一三名。屬於一六五家。其中已經或已再經注射者二一六名。未經注射者一九七名。其自和後一個月至二歲時夭亡者。有已受注射者十三名。卽百分之六。有未受注射者二十六名。卽百分之一二·六。其已受注射者所以夭亡之原因如次。四名死於氣管支肺炎。三名死於腸炎。一名死於痢疾。二名死於疹子。三名死於腦膜炎。</p>
<p>一九三一年騐視之孩童共五一六名。屬於一九九家。其中已經或已再經注射者二八三名。未經注射者二三三名。其自生後一個月至一歲時夭亡者。有已經注射者十五名。卽百分之五·三。有未經注射者三十二名。卽百分之一三·七。其已經注射者所以夭亡之原因如次。三名死於腦膜炎。二名死於疹子。二名死於災禍。三名死於氣管支肺炎。三名死於腸炎。二名死於百日嗽。</p>
<p>余特意將此可作證據之調查詳情予以發表。然與此同類可發表之件。可有數百件。而其證據更爲確實。蓋在上件中所列。乃係關於Ｂｒｅｓｔ地方之特别情形。故吾人宜注意者卽在此時期中該地曾發現極急烈之兒童流行病。施其威虐。在實際上吾人可以看出。凡係已經用ＢＣＧ注射過者。卽對於結核病以外之各種病症。其抵抗能力亦較之去經注射者爲强。（未完）</p>

<h3>討債的兒子</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>前幾天，Ｗ先生的糼兒在醫院中斷了呼吸的時候，我也在塲。看了Ｗ夫人的如痴如醉的悲哀狀態，我和許多在旁的人想不出一句勸慰的話，只能和床上的小小的屍體，一同堅守沈默。</p>
<p>然而我心裏想着，這眞是討債的兒子啊！</p>
<p>窮人們有一種自剙的哲學，他們的哲學體系，完全根據他們的實生活而產生，和他們的實生活極其密合，因而可以直接地解釋他們的實生活。例如上面所說的「討債的兒子」這概念，也是他們的哲學中所包含的。</p>
<p>據聖人所定，父子是人倫之一，所以父要慈，子要孝。但窮人們懂不得這種道理。他們只信自已所想，以爲「」積榖防飢，養兒防老。」因爲「防老」，纔「養兒」的，所以，養了兒，一定希望他將來能够轉養父母。然而偏有許多兒子，竟在半途夭折了，受了父母的養育，而並不轉養父母。</p>
<p>在這時候，爲父母者，便像蝕了本錢的商人，感到極大的損失。但在這時候，他們的哲學就用得着了；這是因爲自已在前世欠下債之故呀！死了的孩子並不是兒子，是陰間差來的討債人，現在是債討淸了，所以回去了。</p>
<p>這樣，他們還能算出一個數目來，從他們的妻子懷孕起到他們的孩子死亡止，這其間爲這孩子而用的錢的總和，便是他們前世所欠的債的數目。</p>
<p>但窮人倒底是窮，所以只計較錢而不計較精神。倘是别的人們，則要計較精神而不計較錢了。</p>
<p>看了Ｗ夫人的狀態而使我想到她的兒子之「討債」者，就是她的精神方面的太多的耗費。</p>
<p>世人都希望養好子弟，但子弟有種種的好法，富貴人家的所謂好子弟，不過「譬如芝蘭玉樹，欲使其生於庭階」，但在窮人看來，這樣的並不是好子弟，而且是最兇的討債者，他們並不是向他們的父母討債，而是向多數的窮人討債。　　只有窮人們的子弟，倘不半途夭折，一定能够還債。他們不但能够償付所欠於父母的債，並且對整個社會，尤其是對富人們，償付了許多然而，他們其實並没有對富人們欠下債的，倘若一定要說欠下，那也只能說是前世的事了。</p>
<h3>陶淵明的時代人格與詩</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>答孤雲先生</p>
<p>我和孤雲先生一樣地是陶詩愛好者，他那孤芳自賞的人格更使我們感動，容易吸引我們變成「陶黨」。但他的人格儘管「偉大」，他的詩儘管「淡遠自然」，我們還不應「阿其所好」說他是「一個會作詩的農夫」。</p>
<p>東晋以後，兵連禍結，閭巷蕭條，廋峻謂「鄢陵舊五六萬户，今裁有數百」。其地曠人稀如此。在上的「春廢勸課之制，冬峻立租之令，下未見施，惟賦是問一。以至「不耕之夫，動以萬計一。（温嶠語）加以「豪家富室，多佔取公田，貴價僦稅，以與貧民」。以至「富者犬馬餘菽粟；···貧者不厭糟糠」。這是陶淵明所處的時代，陶淵明若眞是一個會作詩的「農夫」，他的作品，必不至全然忽視這農村的暗影。杜甫李白同遭天實之亂，杜詩中可以找到亂離的慘象，而李詩中全没這麽一回事；陶詩之於農村，猶李詩之於戰禍，並不曾深切了解的。　　嘗讀陶詩，每覺一草一木，無不可親；狗吠雞鳴，令人神往，所謂「采菊東籬下，悠然見南山」是也。其移居詩；「，言笑無厭時」。其飲酒詩；故人賞我趣，　壼相與至；班荆坐松下，數斟已復醉。文老雜亂言，觴酌失行次；不覺知有我，安知物爲貴？」這簡直是桃花源中人的生活了，他爲何還要夢想桃花源的仙境呢？可見他是從現實中躱避出來，不曾了解農村的。前年，武漢大水汪洋，萬民爲魚，有月夜浮舟挾妓簫歌者，亦頗有詩意；然在災民心目中，此悠揚之歌聲究作何種反應！吾輩生千百年之後，與陶淵明之時代痛癢無關，乃覺陶詩無一不爽心怡目。若取晋書宋書細讀之，當必生别一種感慨來。東晋文人，大都躱避現實，以道家佛家思想爲躱避的去處；陶淵明自有其「象牙之宫」，閒雲野鶴，我們小農民豈敢高攀，與之爲伍嗎？</p>
<h3>内戰與婚姻問題</h3>
<p>— 味茘</p>
<p>年來國内有許多慈善家打電報做文章主張廢止内戰，這不但白費氣力，縱使做得到的話，也是非常可惜，因爲内戰確有許多好處，</p>
<p>我覺得内戰最大的好處是能够解决婚姻問題。（這是多麽累人的問題）！别人我不知道，我自已却有好幾次經騐··每逢内戰正酣的時候，在戰區附近地方人家，結婚總比平常多幾倍。這次某省内戰正起勁的時候，在我住的離戰區不遠的某城中，天天看見大飯店闊旅館門口掛着「某某聯婚」「某府迎親」這一類鮮花紥成的橫額。我每次打從這些地方經過，心中便不禁有感··内戰造福婚姻匪淺！</p>
<p>内戰期内結婚增加的原因是很容易明白的。本來天下父母誰不希望自已的兒女早日成親，可是希望只管希望，事實上有許多困難。尤其在這個不景氣的年頭，娶一門親眞不容易。窮人不必說起，有錢的人也有他們的難處，因爲錢越多排塲越大。在平時，媒人總要來回跑許多趟婚事才可以成功；從訂婚到結婚不知還要經過多少難關？現在呢，兵臨城下，逃難要緊，誰有工夫去找媒人，所以只得「因陋就簡」地結婚了。在老年人看起來，夫妻兩口兒逃難比一對未婚靑年男女同行總妥當些；尤其是爲女兒擇婿的父母，把女兒嫁了一個相當的人，心上覺得放下一個石頭。</p>
<p>就子女這方面說，這種外來的壓迫也是有好處的。摩登人物口頭雖贊成戀愛不應當有條件，可是結婚仍舊是有條件的。大學生如果和中學生結婚，他總覺得有點屈就，尤其是女子。至於有汽車没有汽車，會跳舞不會跳舞，有時候也成爲婚姻的先决條件。所以戀愛的結果不一定是結婚，因爲結婚的阻礙實在太多。現在大禍臨頭，從前種種阻礙都無形消滅了。不但頑固的父母現在讓步了，不再反對自由結婚，就是男女靑年自已心理上起了一種新變化··女的怕丘八强姦趕快想嫁一個夫婿；男的呢，飛機天天在頭上盘旋，炸彈拍拉拉地打下來，說不定有一天要打到自已身上，可是到閻羅王面前「對簿」的時候，至少不要被他嘲笑做了一輩子男人不曾和女子睡過覺。所以這又是結婚增加的原因。</p>
<p>這樣看起來，内戰對於婚姻是很有功勞的，換句話說，對於國家有很大的貢獻。因爲立國的基本條件就是人口。古今中外有眼光的政治家没有一個不贊成增加人口，法國政府甚至每年花許多錢奬勵法國人生小孩。增加人口决不是講空話做文章可以辦行到的；如果大家立誓不結婚，人口怎麽會增加呢？提倡結婚方法原是很多，但是内戰確是促進婚姻一個最好的方法，因此我覺得廢止内戰是很可惜的。</p>
<h3>梁任公在湖南（二）</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>戊戌維新運動，梁任公在湖南講學，引起思想界的軒然大波，卽新舊兩派的大衝突。究竟當日舊派攻擊梁先生，怎樣措詞呢？</p>
<p>自然，欲加之罪，何患無辭！在舊派的眼光中，梁任公是敗壞湖南學風的罪魁，是邪說異端的惡魔。蘇輿翼敎叢編序中說</p>
<p>梁啓超主講時務學堂，張其師說，　　一時衣冠之倫，罔顧名義，奉爲敎宗。其言以康之新學僞經考，孔子</p>
<p>改制考爲主，而平等，民權，孔子紀年諸謬說輔之。僞六籍，滅聖經也；託改制，亂成憲也；倡平等，墮綱常也；伸民權，無君上也；孔子紀年，欲人不知有本朝子。</p>
<p>這里宣布了梁任公在湘講學的五大罪。又舊派的湘省學約裏說；</p>
<p>自新會梁啓超來湘，爲學堂總敎習，大張其師康有爲之邪說，蠱惑湘人，無識之徒，翕然從之。其始隨聲附和，意在趨時，其後迷惑旣深，心腸頓易。考其爲說，或推尊摩西，主張民權。或效耶穌紀年，言素王改制。其謂合種以保種，中國非中國，且有君民平等，君統太長等語，見於學堂評語，學會講義，及湘報，湘學報者，不勝縷指，似此背叛君父，誣及經傳，化日光天之下，魑魅橫行，非吾學中之大患哉？</p>
<p>這里舊派駡梁任公··『化日光天之下，魑魅橫行，』眞是白盡見鬼！但在當時，他們是自以爲駡得痛快的。現在我們從這類文章中，還可以看到梁任公在湖南講學的影響之大！如嶽麓書院學生賓鳳陽等上王益吾院長書中云··</p>
<p>竊我省民風素樸，自去夏以前，固一安靜世界也。自黃公度視察來，而有主張民權之說；自徐觀夫學使到，而多崇奉康學之人；自熊秉三庶常邀請梁啓超主講時務學堂，以康有爲之弟子，大暢師說，而黨與翕張，根基盤固，我省民心頓爲一變。···戴德誠樊錐唐才常易鼐等承其流風，肆行狂煽，直欲死中國之人心，翻亘古之學案，上自衡永，下至岳常，邪說浸淫，觀聽迷惑．不解熊譚戴樊唐易諸人是何肺肝，必欲傾覆我邦家也！</p>
<p>一則曰『我省民心，頓爲一變。』再則曰『上自衡永，下至岳常，邪說浸淫，觀聽迷惑。』梁任公講學的魔力眞是不小！其實，當時這位思想界的新英雄，正是時勢造成的，舊派又何嘗不知？所以梁鼎芬與王祭酒書中說·</p>
<p>馬關約定數年，又有膠州之事。四夷交侵，羣奸放恣，於是崇奉邪敎之康有爲梁啟超，乘機煽亂，昌言變敎。</p>
<p>平心論之，當時滿淸政府。内政外交，無一是處。康梁昌言變法維新，改革政治，有什麽罪過？可惜當時舊派不知，稍後知道了，已經没有辦法，滿淸也就亡了！</p>
<h3>奶媽（三）</h3>
<p>— 徐轉蓬</p>
<p>「没有，太太。」</p>
<p>「呵，最好你把小衫褲換换。」</p>
<p>太太說話時的面容，有如十二月淸晨的嚴肅。</p>
<p>「是的，剛是今天才換的呢。」</p>
<p>她在驚訝中答應出來，面孔一直紅到耳根。天呵，她的衣服統是破舊的，胸前全是永遠洗不去的污點油跡，剛洗了，看上去仍是灰黯骯髒的。</p>
<p>太太的臉浮晝出厭惡輕視的神氣，她走到丈夫身邊責問丈夫··「怎麽給你選中了這樣一個粗脚粗手，骯髒的奶媽呢？」</p>
<p>「呃，你要知道，」她丈夫說，「這種粗脚粗手，母牛一樣的鄕下人，奶水格外多···我們只要她的奶水哩···」</p>
<p>「對了。」太太並不主張要雇个漂亮的奶媽的。她終于喃喃的說··「只是太髒一點··只是··」</p>
<p>太太於是去對奶媽說··</p>
<p>「我覺得你的奶水很好，不過有一點小毛病，那也不管它了，你在這里住一禮拜試試看吧」</p>
<p>太太又另外特地提出來吩咐她··</p>
<p>「你如果把孩子喂得好，可以一直住在我家里，等孩子長大不吃奶時再走。」</p>
<p>「那就更好了，太太。」她如得了歸宿似的。</p>
<p>「你家里的丈夫會同意嗎？」</p>
<p>「丈夫管不了我的。」</p>
<p>「暫時把丈夫忘記了吧，一心養我的孩子。」太太這麽說。</p>
<p>丈夫同她同年紀，結婚剛一年，可是他不能養活一個孩子，而把他送進育嬰堂去了。偶然想起自已的男人，也没有値得懷戀的地方。</p>
<p>一禮拜過去，奶媽没有被太太所扔棄，留住下來</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>在廚下，她和女廚子坐在一塊，從她那邊探問一些關於太太的脾氣和家庭情形。　　「你聽到太太說過關於我的話嗎？」</p>
<p>「太太說你太髒。」</p>
<p>「說我太醜没有？」</p>
<p>「人物醜一點有什麽道理呢，前個奶媽生得委實漂亮，圓圓的臉，比太太自已要好看一倍」</p>
<p>，衣服也穿得整齊，人看去也是聰明人，不知道爲了什麽原故，不合太太的脾氣，一禮拜便把她辭退了····」</p>
<p>於是，她明白自已的缺點並不在面貌上，（太太不需要一個漂亮的奶媽。）是在那滿身污點的破舊的不潔凈的衣服上。當這初夏天氣，要穿一身新衣裳也並不怎樣費錢，穿上一套白竹布的小衫褲，人就變成個新人了。</p>
<p>她預先向女廚子借了錢，做了新的衣服。</p>
<p>她那一切的缺點，好像被新的衣服遮去了。她梳光頭髮，常常刮臉，拔去濃黑的眉毛，也常常因爲一滴油跡污點在新衣服上發現而煩惱着。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>孩子到了奶媽身邊，淸癯的尖面孔，口腮，漸漸發胖了。太太的親戚朋友上她家里來看見孩子，和前些日子一比較，大家都稱讚奶媽養孩子的能幹。只是太太自已從没有吐出一聲讚許。孩子睡在奶媽身邊，晚上哭的次數也減少了。偶然哭了一次，第二天太太就提起責問··　　「昨晚爲什麽讓孩子哭呢？」</p>

<h3>美國减低平價之意義</h3>
<p>— 趙超構</p>
<p>所謂平價，是兩國間貨幣所含成分的比率。减低平價的意思就是把這貨幣所含的成分减低。例如日本對美平價爲每百圓四九·八五金元，若减低平價二分之一，則共新平價爲每百圓二十五金元弱。簡單地說，减低平價卽是把貨幣單位所含的金價値减少，因而該貨幣的價値也减低。</p>
<p>普通减低平價的目的有二··其一是想終止國内通貨膨脹，安定物價。蓋一國經過通貨膨脹，物價已騰貴后，其對外匯兌必下落，要想回復舊時平價是很困難的，轉不若减低舊時平價，以新平價安定貨幣之對内對外的購買力。其二恰與上相反，以减低平價爲膨脹通貨之一手段，蓋如减低貨幣成分二分之一，則該國凖備金立可增加一倍，因而紙幣發行數量也可擴張一倍。</p>
<p>據今天（二月二日按美國發表係爲一月三十一日）消息，美已正式减低平價爲五角九分零六毫，其程度比較如左··</p>
<p>金元之　滙兌减　買金價　　金價增</p>
<p>成分　　價比率　加率</p>
<p>舊平價　二三·二　　二○·七</p>
<p>新平價　一三·八　四○　三四·七　六七</p>
<p>此消息發表后，世人都以爲貨幣戰將愈激烈，但我以爲這種觀察或許過慮，事實上也許是滙兌比率成立的先聲。</p>
<p>美國這次减低平價的舉動很有特異處，旣想藉此以减輕通貨膨脹的危險，又欲以此恢復物價。可以說是兼有上述兩種目的。一方是貫澈買金政策的壓低金元價格，同時又安定對外滙價，去年早就傳過美國將减低平價，后來却宣佈了買金政策，這次又轉而减低平價，其中關係，我們可依下列事實分析之··</p>
<p>（一）美國自施行復興運動法后，初雖奏微效但結果未能盡如所期，一方生產者的成本增高，同時大衆購買力又趕不上物價，所以七月以后物價轉逆。羅斯福便不能不以最后手段壓低金元，那便是買金政策。然而結果買金政策也不十分美滿　我　　　　較英美的實際滙價與偸　紐約金價所算出來的滙價，就可知買金政策之失敗了。</p>

<p>十一月十二日　五·一二　五·○九</p>
<p>十四日　五·一八　五·一六</p>
<p>十五日　五·二二　五·二八</p>
<p>十六日　五·二○　五·四一</p>
<p>十四日以前，金價所算出的匯價都較實際滙價爲高，這正是紐約買金價較倫敦高些，因而領導着滙價走，可以說是買金政策的正常效果。但十五日以后情形不同了。滙價反較金價所算出的滙價爲高，實際滙價變動於金價之外，英美滙兌已落入投機行爲中，是買金政策已失去統制金元的能力了，金元的變動已無法制止，不得不算是買金政策的失敗。（二）買金政策旣告失敗，國内情形又日非，銀行始終不肯放手投資，雖經强森將軍與銀行界威嚇交涉，但以金元不安定，銀行界亦强硬拒絶。銀行界要求非放棄不健全的通貨政策，不能供給信用。眞如此，則產業復興終必致停頓。這也促使羅斯福安定金元。（三）羅斯福最初衹以爲壓低金元卽可提高物價，始終未向安定方面着想。結果，金元的價格雖减低，而資本逃避，外國的關稅報復，英鎊的强硬都爲美國以不利，如果長此下去，一旦促致金本位集團破裂，則參加貨幣戰的國家愈衆，把金元减低的利益也會犧牲，所以不若安定金元於相當低價，再與各國交涉滙兌比率。（四）加以國内素有膨脹派與健全派之分，買金政策宣佈時，健全派的人員先后離職在野表示反對，國内與論反對的傾向漸增，羅斯福亦不得不終止懸崖勒馬了。</p>
<p>根據上四點，我以爲這次美國减低平價與其說會引起更激烈的貨幣戰，毋寗說是成立滙兌比率的導綫，蓋祇要美國肯安定滙價，英國總是不成問題的。事實上美國若非於事先和英國有相當的諒解，决不敢大胆的减低平價。</p>
<p>恐一日安定金元，英日等有再行隆低滙兌之虞。若英美事先旣有諒解，則世界滙兌的安定是　能的，美國握住二十億元的平衡基金，縱使目前英美滙兌有暫時的競爭，也是容易矯正的，或者會打開世界通貨問題的新局面亦未可知</p>
<h3>日本北洋漁業之概况</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>（一）緖論</p>
<p>據一月三十一日東京電稱，同日衆議院預算總會中，政友會之靑木精一氏，建議北洋漁業之擁護問題。略云··「···但對於北洋漁業本體之經費與方法，應置諸國家統制下，并創設北洋漁業公司。」廣田外相答曰··「爲對抗蘇俄之國營政策起見，應創設半官半商之公司以經營之」云云。（詳見二月一日申報及時事新報。）北洋漁業問題，頗常惹起日蘇間之齟齬，去年更有俄艦砲擊日漁船事件。夫日人素以貪婪狡猾見稱，對此强鄰，烏能容忍？其寢食不忘，以謀對策，理所當然。本文之作，卽所以略述北洋漁業之沿革，復明其現况，更進而分析北洋漁業問題　結之所在也。</p>
<p>（二）北洋漁業之沿革</p>
<p>北洋者係指白令海，俄柯資克海，及日本海之北部而言也。面積甚廣，計五十三萬方浬，較北歐之國際漁塲鼎鼎大名之北海尤大四倍。其水產物種類，雖較諸南洋產者略少，然在量的方面，則有過之而無不及。其產物以鯥，鱒，鰊，　，大鮃，鰈，蟹，鯨及其他海獸爲大宗，運鎖亦遠及歐美，故北洋漁業，實亦世界的漁業也。開拓之者，自爲日俄兩國人士。迨明治八年，千島交換條約中，俄國占有樺太之南部，由是同地漁業亦歸俄人所有，然日本仍得經營於其領海内也，無何俄方知日人左㝳樺太經營漁業之有利，乃有排斥日本漁業而奬勵本國漁業之舉。如課以苛稅，限制漁具，漁法，閉鎖漁塲等，日漁業者大受打擊，泰半破產。直至明治三十五年，制定外國領海水產組合法，始有現在之俄領水產組合。至明治三十七八年日俄戰役，日本勝利，乃奪得遠東俄領漁業權，四十年更正式有日俄漁業恊約之成立，日本北洋漁業遂日進千里。爾後蘇維埃政府成立，乃有昭和三年（一九二八）現行日蘇漁業條約之締結。新約中規定，兩國間大部分漁塲之租借權，俱得延長至一九三六年，故一時尙得苟安。</p>
<p>日本漁業發軔於明治二十六年，時郡司大尉等開拓北千島，組織報公義會，三十二年，有正式從事俄柯資克海　漁業之舉，同時前後，北洋更有日本腽肭獸獵船。大正十年，更有工船蟹漁業。母船式鯥鱒漁業勃起於昭和年代，魚糧工船。工船則最近始有之。</p>
<p>北洋漁業生產物，鯥，鱒，鰊，鱈蟹類，每年約十萬噸，價値五千萬日元，漁業勞働者約二萬四千餘人，使用船舶二百五十餘艘，約重五十萬噸。漁業用資金年約二千萬元之鉅，漁塲上財產逹四千萬元，故北洋漁業實係日本水產業上重要之一部，與人口，食糧勞働對外貿易船舶運輪各項有莫大之關係也。</p>
<p>（三）日本之北洋漁業現狀</p>
<p>現在北洋經營之日本漁業，約可分爲下列五種··</p>
<p>（一）俄領漁業，俄領漁業，係根據一九二八年日蘇漁業條約，日本人得在蘇聯領海内經營之漁業。據該契約，漁塲稱爲漁區，由日蘇兩國政府同意而租借。現日本人租借之漁區數，逹三百五十處，每年繳納租金與稅金及其他四百萬元以上。日人於每年四五月及八九月間，駕駛漁船，以建網或刺網捕取鮭，鱒，鰊及蟹等。平均年約八萬噸，價値三千萬元内外。漁獲物中之鯥，鱒，蟹，造成罐頭食品，年約八十萬聽，最多時則逹一百萬聽。其中輪往英美法荷比澳及南洋各地者年約五十萬至七十萬聽，價逹二千萬日元。醃製及冷藏者約五萬噸，價値一千萬日元，則以供日本本國之消費。漁業經營者最多時逹百餘，幾經合併收買及昭和七年大合併之結果。其數銳减。現在除日魯漁業株式會社外，僅餘私人漁業者四。漁業勞働者約三萬人，使用船舶二百五十餘艘，重三十餘噸。</p>
<p>（二）工般蟹漁業蟹工船崛起於大正十的前後，泊乎十二年依工船蟹漁業取締規則，始得正式營業。目下在俄柯資克海，白令海公海等處撈漁。使用工般碩大無比，自二千噸以至六千噸不等。船上有完善之罐頭製造設備，漁具，漁船及其他漁業用品。由漁業用稱爲獨航船之發動機船引導，每年五月頭起駛往漁塲以刺網捕蟹，卽在船上造成罐頭食品，於八九月始返國。蟹工船業之黃金時代爲昭和五年，時有船舶十九，計六萬噸，勞働者七千餘人，製造罐頭食品四十萬聽以上，價逹一千五百萬元，以運銷美洲居多。惟近年世界恐慌，購買力减少，供過於求，不得不限制生產。工船减至七艘，勞働者二千人，製造罐頭額十五萬聽。本業亦幾經歸併，迄今俱師併於日本合同工船株式會社，惟尙有私人企業者二，兼營魚糧工船漁業。</p>
<p>（三）母船式鯥鱒漁業日本俗呼之爲「鯥鱒之冲取漁業，」勃興較晚，自昭和四年母船式鯥鱒取締規則成立，始正式撈魚。其漁業於俄</p>
<p>與工船蟹漁業大略酷肖。有與工船相當之母船，罐頭製造設備裝置其中，其外尚有醃藏，冷藏等保藏設備。漁獲物專限於鯥鱒類。母船與蟹工船同，有獨航船伴行，每年五月間出發漁具雖有建綱與流綱二種，近以後者收效宏，故有全部採取流網之傾向矣。撈獲物在母船内製成罐藏，醃藏，或冰藏，八月間還歸内地。母船在昭和四年僅有一艘，一千噸，獨航船二艘，漁獲額十五噸，價額五千元餘。其後突飛猛進，昭和八年已有母船十九艘，二萬八千噸，獨航船百七十五艘，漁獲額約一萬噸，價値五百五十萬元上下。其中罐製品二十萬聽，價逹四百七十餘萬元；醃藏品及其他價逹八十五萬元。因與俄領漁區毘連，故時有衝突之事。據日人觀察，此漁業本不僅囿於現在堪察加一帶，將來尚可擴至俄可資克，薩哈連及白令海東部方面。此外有非母船式鯥鱒漁業之鯥鱒流網漁業者，去年始勃興於北千島之幌延島，繼得北海道官憲許可，乃正式出漁。有發動機船百七十艘，成績斐然，其漁業與北洋之鯥鱒漁業有密切關係。</p>
<p>（四）　漁業此漁業以百噸乃至二百噸之帆船，在俄柯資克海之公海捕捉　魚（卽太口魚）。以漁獲物製成醃　或　乾　。此漁業已有相當歷史，上已言之。惜因漁獲物之敗路卽未開拓，製造方法又未有改善，故無蒸蒸日上之發達。現有漁船十艘，漁獲額百三十萬尾，價值僅二十餘萬，多銷運國內，以殆為北洋漁業中不重要者。</p>
<p>五漁糧工船漁業　此亦肇始於昭和八年，係日本農林省奬勵而興起者。漁業之組織，係設備有魚糧製造機械之工船，另具附屬之機械小船，撈捕　，蝶魚類而製成魚糧。漁塲在白令海東部之公海。昭和八年（一九三三）出漁工船二艘，原料雖豐富，惟因機械運用不得宜及其他障害之故，成績無預期之佳。然魚糧之世界的需要極鉅，故日本政府已處心積慮以謀改善之。</p>
<p>（四）日蘇之北洋漁業戰</p>
<p>帝俄時代，俄人在北洋漁業本微乎其微，自一九二八年現行日蘇漁業條約實施以來，日本漁業者之優良漁區，大受侵蝕，日魯漁業會社吃虧尤甚。史逹林執政後，俄方更有五年漁業計劃之施行，於是日進千里。現已有漁區三百八十八區，駸駸乎凌駕日人而上之。俄方蟹工船於一九二八年始有一艘出現，一九三一年已逹十一艘。其他新造捕漁機械船二十艘，流網漁船十七艘。又去年更有捕鯨工船一艘，及捕魚船三艘之出現。日本漁業雖亦幾往奮鬥，與昭和四年（一九二九）較，船舶增加百分之三十，然與蘇聯之增加百分之七十，眞迺膛乎其後矣。往昔日俄漁區數，合計不過三百所，今則有七百餘區，故日本平均漁獲額自有减少之傾向。且漁區租金日漸高騰（現約爲四百萬元），在此雙重壓迫下，日方之謀對策，實爲必然。而其對策，又不出靑木精一氏與廣由外相之意，卽（一）統制漁業，與（二）改訂漁業條約是也。</p>
<p>（一）統制漁業各漁區雖俱有統制之必要，然俄領漁業，爲謀對抗蘇聯漁業競爭計，尤爲當務之急。昭和七年，日魯漁業株式會社成立，卽係合併俄領漁業四十一家而成者。雖有三四家同業不肯參與，然實際上該會社已爲該代行權益之唯一機關。以後該處之漁業統制，自較容易。至如其他漁區，因俱在日法令之下，統治事業，更易進行。　　（二）改定現行漁業條約現行漁業條約成立於昭和一年五月，上已言及。其有效期間八年，八年後改訂一次後，以前以每十二年爲有效期間。首次八年期間，後至一九三六年爲止。日人現既備受蘇聯漁業之脅迫，除自謀統制外，自當厲行其強硬外交政策，以保護其北洋漁業。今年爲一九三四年，雖爲尚早，然日本朝野人士，俱以有遠慮著稱，已開始在議會討論該問題。其結果如何，自有雄辯之事實顯示吾人，吾人拭目以待之可也。</p>
<h3>漁業統制之初步作工</h3>
<p>— 若搴</p>
<p>日前嘗論吾國漁業有統制之必要，（見本刊第四十五期）良以目下吾國漁民之生活環境，生涯狀況，以及魚產之運銷，舶來品之侵入，非加以統制，難期有效。然統制自何入手，又以漁業之淩雜無序，向又缺乏記載，情形實然，故非先行調查不爲功。蓋水產經濟之基本要件，一則爲天然之供給，自以海洋之廣，可用之多爲第一義。然此項水面積中　溫度，水質如何？海流潮汐之影響如何？餌料之含畜，光綫之透視，以及海之形質　　如何？俱　　影響漁業之生產　　　　　爲方面船漁　漁具之能力如何？漁撈之　　　　　　　　　何製藏？歉收而如何增殖？都爲漁業盛衰之關鍵。更如勞力之供給，資本之多寡，與民間之組織，漁業之共同經營等，在在與漁業生產有密切之關係，但試問今日中國水產經濟之狀況，究屬如何？則大都含糊其辭，但知漁產之多，漁民民眾，然試追問漁產之究有幾許？漁村破產之因果如何？以及水產經濟上相互關係如何，則統計毫無，而數字又不正確，是以非從事於詳實之調查，不克獲統制之功。（今每有以爲吾國漁業幼稚，而不　　以統　，然唯其幼稚，故必須統制，上文已有　述，故不　述）　　今姑不論漁業天然之供給，祗以歷來吾國漁獲之數值言，則各書記載之統討數字，尚不一致，如近來中國建設七卷三期有鄧騰裕君著「經濟恐慌中之漁業開拓」一文，其所引出全國漁產之數値，係以每海里生產九千三百二十一元四角計算，故其總計爲五千萬元；而申報年鑑之記載，則爲一萬五千三百四十七萬元；中國建設七卷二期水產專號第六十六頁有「去歲（二十一年）全國漁產統計，總値二萬餘萬元（二零八、八七八、六九五元）、以上係根據漁商之報告一之記載，同爲二十二年出版之刋物，相差有如是之鉅，則此項估計之統計數字，曷克爲統制之根據。是以欲謀漁業之統制，自不得不以調查入手！</p>
<p>再所謂統制漁業者，非因漁產之少，而卽創辦幾隻新式漁輪，海盜横行，而乃派數艘巡艦游弋海面之謂也。必先有詳確之調查，然後設合理之計劃。且今之欲統制者，大都倣效歐美，其實各國有各國之經濟背影，何能强同。水產一業，自亦不能例外。雲如淡水漁業發逹之德國，其計劃决不能適合於遠洋捕鍄業盛行之挪威，復如今日盛行漁業統制之日本，其主點舍漁業採捕之統制外，在於水產品輸出檢查之統制；而美國自藍鷹運動發生後，漁業界亦急謀統制，但其主點則在於水產罐頭業之維持。是以欲謀吾國漁業統制之收效，則必先調查詳實狀况，以爲入手也。</p>
<p>凡此三端，可知欲謀吾國漁業之振興與統制有效，自必先行整個漁業之調查，但欲謀調查之完密，則其方策，决非一紙公文委託各省縣將漁况塡報，便克濟事。蓋吾國各省縣對漁業大都忽略，卽令派員調查塡報，而以無漁業知識，决難詳實，是以必由中央設立全國漁業調查處，（如美國設有中央漁業調查所而日本之水產試騐機關亦先以調查爲基礎，亦曾有調查所之設立）派漁業技術人員分赴全國沿海切實調查；一方復與各省市合組調查分處，進行各項基礎調查統計，則成績當可立見。至全國漁業調查所之創立，自以全國經濟委員會籌設爲是，蓋該會握有全國經濟之權，且深信吾國產業之挽救，必須應用統制經濟之政策也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「商業競賣」的文人</h3>
<p>— 靑農</p>
<p>沈從文先生在北方（天津大公報文學週刋上）攻擊了「」海派一下，說是「名士才情與商業競賈的結合」，便引起上海的「海派」文人的回槍與少數賣文章吃飯的人的誤會，關於誰是「海派」我已經在「自由談」上說過，前天本刋還有阿晏先生發表「論賣文爲活」替海派辯護，這就令人不能不說話了。</p>
<p>阿晏先生根據着「商業競賣」這一點而說，「總計沈從文先生等對於海派文人的攻擊最大的罪狀就是「商業競爭」，這裏所謂「商業競爭是包刮很多的，但因此我就想起了文人「賣文爲活」一件事來。（原文照抄）接著對於「賣文爲活」的大道理，發揮盡「緻」，而且攻擊沈從文先生一下說，「說到刻薄一點，就是他那篇攻擊人家寫文章吃飯的那篇文章，就是拿稿費甚至爲了稿費而寫的。」（原文照抄）這種誤會，其作用只有給「海派」文人一種「助紂為虐」，而對於沈從文先生是「狗咬呂洞賓不識好人。」這裡容不着多說話，只舉出沈從文先生原文中的意思來說，他并不是只在上海的作家都爲「海派，」他聽過魯迅先生顧然不是「海派」所謂「海派」文人是那一一羣呢？我在「自由談」上面拆穿了西洋鏡，「」</p>
<p>指出了「偸了成名作家的作口」，是「海派」以朋友的優秀作品聲稱借看而冒名發表以成名的人，是「海派」自已已經成名而以未成名作家的作品用自已的「招牌」發表以騙錢的人，是「海派」翻譯外國雜志的文章，以及整本作品不註明是譯作而發表的人，是「海派」以廉價收買翻譯作品而用自已的「招牌」以求名利雙收的人，是「海派。」現在再添上一兩個人上去吧。以别的作家的作品搜集剪貼編成什麽小說選集詩歌選集等書出版以騙錢的人，是「海派」看了外國電影或外國小說以後偸竊原意改頭換面地寫成小說以作自已的創作的人，是「海派。」等等。這一羣「海派」文人他們只因「商業競賣」而連人格與稿子一起出賣，這與「賣文爲活」的人完全不同。阿晏先生有所誤會似地爲「海派」文人辯護，竞至於以「商業競賣」這一意義聯想到「賣文爲活」上去，這是不明瞭上海文壇之事實的綠故吧。我再在這裏說一聲，這一羣「海派」文人連人格與稿子一起出賣，不用怪及「京派」作家的輕視，個中人心裏有數，原不必多所喃舌，可是他們正是「商人與賊，」不揭發以攻，未免丢盡文壇之醜。如果以爲自已在上海賣文，人家駡秃　，便以爲自已也是和尙而憤憤然以爭，那是大可以不必的。</p>
<p>這一羣「商人與賊」的，「海派」文人有老有少，左翼右翼以及無聊文學派都有，已經成名者醜名狼藉，剛在有名者亦人所皆知，我們「賣文爲活」的人只能認之爲「漢奸，」而加以攻擊。且社會上對於這一羣人正應該，給以道德的制裁</p>
<p>競賣之所，「海派」文人之所以成爲奸商市儈也有共環境的薰染所致，實在不足爲奇；「往者已矣，來者可追」，「亡羊補牢，未这爲晚，」這裏竭誠希望「海派」文人自今而後努力創作，爲中國文壇發出燦爛光明的色彩。不然的話，文塲到底不是商塲，奸商市儈的把戲只能够騙人以一時，終究不能够掩住自已的尾巴；而原形畢露以後，呌賣的狗肉終究是狗肉，讀者是已經認明貨色，决不會還以爲是羊肉的呵。</p>
<h3>這就是「人情世故」嗎</h3>
<p>— 毛心一</p>
<p>兄</p>
<p>好久没有見面了，想你身體很健？近來我因爲幹了一件比較痛快的事；但是囉，事情還没有幹究結，倒先受了一般親友們的譏笑，並且送了我「不懂世故的蠢孩子」的雅號。唉，我受了滿肚子的氣憤，實在没處可以去發洩；所以特地向你處來伸訴一下，想你必不致於像他們一樣的譏笑我吧？</p>
<p>事情是這樣的··</p>
<p>新年裏的一個假日的下午，因爲看到報載　　影戲院正在開映着一部比較有正確意識的國產片，我於是就約了家裏的幾位表兄們一同去觀影戲去。</p>
<p>進了戲院裏面已經是擁擠了。我們爲的一時找不到一處連座的空位子，因此就各自找坐位；我的表兄們坐在後面的幾排，我就在前面幾排的一個空位子裏坐下。在我的坐位前一排裏，坐着一個年約十八九歲左右的女孩子，好像是她的妹妹罷。</p>
<p>當影片開映到休息五分鐘的時候，事情也就爆發了；忽地來了三個學生模樣的少年，穿着陰丹林布的長衫，袖口捲得半臂，放開了鈕扣的高領口，好似燒飯的風爐；頭髮都梳得很光滑。他們跑到坐在我前排的那個少女身邊，現出浮滑的笑臉，向着伊亂問了一陣；可憐那個少女被他們這樣一來，面部現出了一陣紅一陣白，要想躱避又没有地方。這時候坐在這少女附近的觀衆們，都好像没有事的一般，有幾個還好像在　了這幾個少年胡調呢！我呢，那是心中憤怒的火，早已從兩只眼睛裏要穿出來了。五分鐘休息時問過了，全場又入黑暗中了；不料這幾個無恥的少年，竟做出卑鄙無禮的舉動起來。這時我的視線，又被他們阻住，再也忍不住了，於是就立起向這幾個東西警告··</p>
<p>「喂，這裏是影戲院，請你們保持自已的人格！不是····」</p>
<p>「你是第三者，關你娘的事？」其中</p>
<p>的一個反而向我反問起來。</p>
<p>「你們欺侮人是應該的嗎？」</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>我和他們於是就爭論起來了。</p>
<p>「好！你打抱不平，好。」他說了以後，就拉着其中的另外一個竊竊的耳語幾句，好似是要他監視我着；其餘兩個就出去了。</p>
<p>他們正是幹着興趣濃厚工作（？）的進行中，忽見被我駡破了好夢，當然心中大不樂意着。兩個人影戲也不觀出去了，另一個少年在我傍監視着，無疑的還要和我爲難的呢。可是，固執的我，自信正直公理，到處說行出；他們這種勾引女學生行爲，怪不要臉，怕什麽··我這樣一想，將視線再移到銀幕上。</p>
<p>影戲完了，前排的少女是跟隨着觀客們走了，那個却緊緊地跟住我。我就跑到後排的表兄處，並將上述的情形告訴了他們，滿想他們定會義憤塡胸，或能因此助我一臂之力，不料他們非但不向我表同情，並且還說我多事呢！</p>
<p>當我們出戲院門口的時候，跟着我跑的那個少年，朝戲院　對面一呼，居然立刻有十多個流氓模樣的人向我們圍住着。我這時雖然自知這是「寡不敵衆」的，但滿腔憤慨是再也關不住了，决意和他們死幹一下子。所謂懂得「人情世故」的表兄們，終究把這班狗賊們勸開了，將我拖到了家裏。</p>
<p>回到家裏，我氣冲冲地把這件事向家人伸述一番；可是他們都冷淡地譏笑着，說我是什麽「戆大」「多管閒事。」</p>
<p>還有，父親聽得了，也搖頭嘆息着說··「你這蠢孩子，實在太不懂人情世故」了」唉，我這時胸中怨憤的情緒，恕我這支老爺筆，不能再形容了···</p>
<p>老哥，我直到現在，腦海裏終在轉旋一個問號「？」就是··這就是「人情世故」嗎？</p>
<p>請你告訴我這一點，我　望着。順問</p>
<p>心一上</p>
<h3>一個隆冬的夜裏</h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>是嚴冬的深夜裏，天空中寥寥地只有幾顆星光，死氣沉沉的夜色深深地籠罩着這整個龐大的夜閑人靜的大地。小小的斗室裏，自然逃不了這暮色的罩籠，雖然從窓檻裏透出來一絲。淡然的燈光，但這更顯出它的安恬，悽慘，和黝黯來。</p>
<p>梅　身抖索，筋肉交戰地，在這隆冬的午夜祗有穿了一身襯裏衫褲躱在床的角落裏。上下唇牙齒相擊聲在這寂靜的空氣裏很能够聽得出來。可是她默默無言地好像一個臨罰的囚犯，温柔如綿羊般地等候着一切將要臨到她身上的嚴罰。她無聲地淌着涙，藉此面聊得暫時的安慰。</p>
<p>在梅的對面床頭坐着的而正在大發雷霆的這正是梅的媽，好憑着她無上的家長的威嚴在虐待她的獨生女兒了。</p>
<p>「哈！你以爲今年你已經二十三歲了，可不受我的管束嗎？你時常說什麽二十歲以外的男女在法律上可以取得婚姻的自由權，不憑什麽父母之命，媒妁之言的買賣式的婚姻了。嚇！老實告訴你，我不懂什麽「自由」和「法律」的，所以你休這樣的夢想。嚇！什麽你是受過敎育的人，不願在買賣式的婚姻下犧牲你自已，老實說，你的什麽心思我會不明白？原來你觀在認識的情人是没有錢的窮措大，一貧如洗的窮小子，所以你想用這樣話暗下關照我，最好就給你這樣嫁去。你這種苦命的賤貨根本是不識抬舉的。像養媳婦這般的成親還算是至上的了。嚇···」鼻子裏發出來的冷笑她喝了一口濃茶，仍舊繼續她的　駡。　　「什麽上海有幾個聞人，他們是不曾經過結婚的手續就結合的。這種簡直是下流的把戲，蕩婦的行爲。···你去呌他們拿五千錢來，否則斷絕來往，你是我的人，什麽事都自我的主權。我怕你騾子變狗不成？···現在除非你私奔，除非你不要住在上海。否則跳不脫我的手腕。··唉！家門不幸會好好父母養你這樣的賤貨來。敢與男人至通衢大道並肩着走！唉··你這丢臉的賤貨呀！害得闔家没有光彩。··你又會厲聲的責問我哥哥弟弟這樣可以與女朋友一同出去遊玩？你不知道嗎？男子是没有什麽關係的，丢臉的是别人家的父母。我們那裏能管得這麽許多呢？」</p>
<p>唉！雖然今晚在肉體上受了媽的鞭笞與蹂躪，但我知道這是在無論幹什麽眞理的事情以前所必有的犧牲，我，况且是爲了愛情而犧牲，這是何等够價値的一回事。我應該幹，爲眞理而幹，因爲我是靑年的女子，而况又是受過敎育的靑年的女子。我們要負起我們的重任，來拯救以後的無辜的女子，讓她們得有淸醒的機會，免遭我們的覆轍，或以致跌入深深的不可自拔的漩渦裏。我們祗要認定了目標，勇往直前的幹去。媽没有尊重我的人格，她以我是一架被人活動的機械，我是一件隨人買賣的貨物和玩具。完全没有我自已個性發展的存在。她忽視了我的心靈和人格。像姑表姐吧，她受了金錢的誘惑，結果做了巨商的續絃。十七八歲的姑娘去嫁了一個年邁龍鍾的老頭兒，在精神上所受的痛苦，倒不要去說，這位巨商年近花甲，抱子心切，終於因爲姑表姐的不生半男不育一女而遭了他的遺棄，雖然女子有增加國家人口的重任，可是女子不是專供給人家爲生殖的傢伙和洩慾的器具呀！女子有女子更偉大的職責！</p>
<p>雖然女子之被侮辱爲「玩物」，「洩慾器」，和「生殖的傢伙」。已經有了很悠久的歷史，可是在歷史的每行裏，每一個家庭裏，我隱隱約約地看見了一斑斑的鮮血未凈的痕跡。我嗅到了鮮血的腥氣。我瞥見了膾子手的污手和利刀。啊！我懼怕了。可是呀！滿面瘡痍的大地，賴誰去補呢？我們要伸手喚呼被壓迫的女子，被辱侮的女子起來作一次轟轟烈烈的婦女運動，讓什麽人都知道我們女子是有血氣有精神的人。我們是有獨立的人格。··</p>
<p>··梅在戰抖着然而她腦子裏這樣默默地偉大的想着。</p>
<h3>四個指頭</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>「嚓」。一聲淸脆的嚮亮，王老頭子右手的四個指頭在齒輪一刹那的迅速轉動中齊排地被軋掉，那輪盤帶着他的血和肉繼續旋轉着，速度並不曾因夾縫中增加了人肉的碎屑而稍有變更。</p>
<p>一陣突來的强烈的刺痛猛襲着他的週身，他只覺到眼前一黑，心境有如夜航失舵的海船，在那茫茫無際的墨海之中被狂濤怒浪顚簸着。</p>
<p>快地　　　　步，一根灰色的屋柱洽好支撑着他將要傾倒的身子。</p>
<p>鮮紅的血像失了龍頭的自來水似地奔流着，他本能地用那隻僅有的完好的左手緊緊地揑住着傷口，但他一點也不曾感到什麽楚痛，他現在所感到的只是辛酸，永遠鏤刻在腦膜的幸酸。</p>
<p>他那滿佈縐紋的臉慘白得那樣地可怕，從緊閉着的深陷的眼縫中泪出一滴傷心的淚，亂髮蓬鬆的頭無力地歪到前胸，嘴角微微地在顫動，一眼望去如像一個爛醉半死的酒徒。</p>
<p>「到醫生間去吧？死人！」他被這呌叱聲從迷惘中驚醒，微微地睜開着疲乏的兩眼，一個穿着廠方職員制服的大個子正站在他的前面，在他那睥睨一切的眼光之下，這不幸的負傷者是多麽令人討厭！</p>
<p>他遲緩地從大個子的手中接過一張到醫生間去的便條，他從新發現他的眼前尙有一綫殘餘的微光，那是希望從妙手的醫生的醫治之下能够恢復原來的手。如是，他鼓起了最後的一點勇氣，慢慢地拖着兩條沉重的腿向醫生間走去。</p>
<p>血一點一滴地還在往下淌着，沿途經過許多工人的身旁，每人都向他投射一道恐佈和同情的眼光。</p>
<p>當他踏進那小巧的醫生間，穿白衫的醫生正坐在寫字檯旁，用心地在研究一張女人的照片。</p>
<p>「先生！可憐我的手！···」他凖備着許多許多的話想要向這偉大的醫生苦訴和哀求，但他僅說了一句都給咽住了，只能用那含涙的兩眼表示他心地的酸楚。</p>
<p>醫生好像並不曾發現有人在他的身旁，而且向他在講着話，一雙呆板的眼睛吸顧死死地釘在着那張女人的照片。</p>
<p>半嚮，醫生偶然回過了頭，向他驚疑地望了一眼之後，臉上立時塗上一層不高興的顏色。</p>
<p>「先生！不會殘廢吧！」他的聲音是那樣地抖顫，好像一個被審的罪犯正等候着莊嚴的法官宣佈他的生死。</p>
<p>「也許不會吧！」醫生的口吻是那樣的模稜，使他再無勇氣繼續追問，一切只好任憑命運去擺佈。</p>
<p>經過草率的包扎之後，他被醫生命令着退出醫生間，劈頭却給大個子擋住。</p>
<p>「從明天起你以後不必再來吧！這裏給一個月的工鈿作爲醫藥撫卹費」。</p>
<p>他說着遞過一張「領工票」。</p>
<p>「唔！等傷好了讓我再來做吧！先生！可憐我····」他被宣佈死刑了！只有作最後的哀求，以圖挽救於萬一。</p>
<p>「不成！廠方不能養殘廢的人，因爲你是廠裏做過二十年的老工人，對你特别地優待，要不要隨你自已，橫直廠方亦可以不必寃枉花費這一筆錢。</p>
<p>「那末，先生！請替我想想，一個月的工鈿也買不到一隻完好的手呵」！　　「什麽？廠方拿錢雇你來是做工的，並不曾呌你軋斷自已的手。」</p>
<p>「·······」</p>
<p>「不必廢話吧！不要錢，快點出去。」</p>
<p>他終於從大個子的手中接過那張「領工票」到賬房間領了十幾張一元的鈔票。他用那含涙的眼望一望小小一疊鈔票的紅綠花紋，最後獨自無語地步出了工廠的大門，向着他那不可捉摸的前路走去。</p>
<h3>續談大出喪</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>海軍上將杜錫珪出喪，因爲儀仗十分簡單，祗有軍樂隊數事，不像盛杏生那樣闊豪，人山人海的觀衆，大爲失望這是說明國人（至少也是　人閒人們）好看大出喪之興趣，比隔岸觀火之興趣還濃厚！</p>
<p>大出喪··有莊嚴偉大得可怕的開路神。有斜披着彩色袈裟，精光着雪白腦袋的和尙尼姑們之擠眉弄眼（自然口裏還是不斷地默誦着「南無阿彌陀佛」）。有頭戴紅帽，身穿繡袍，冠冕堂皇，神氣十足的　三之流，所肩荷手舉着的旗傘轎亭，尤其他們各個的那兩隻皮　似棗的泥脚，跑起來把柏油路慣作「叭叭」響聲，不啻爲軍樂隊打緊慢拍子的滑稽神情。有　　　一直看到孝子扎着，充　預備，而始流出；且惟恐地心吸把力，牠吸墜下去的算涕痰涎。於是所謂人山人海，引領跂足的觀者，始興盡而返，甚且或因欣羨之極，忘其所以，亦喟然嘆曰··「彼可取而代也！」</p>
<p>這樣洋洋大觀的大出喪，看的人旣是「其樂陶陶」，拌演的人，看見捧塲之𤍠鬧，求仁得仁，當然也暗中自鳴得意，也許會向親朋道··「今天可算𤍠鬧極了，但我們也可謂滿足觀者之慾望了！」結果，觀大出喪者與大出喪者，皆大歡喜，喪雖兇事，今亦變成大吉大慶矣！</p>
<p>再明顯地說··喪事之會變吉慶，令人「皆大歡喜」，實因主人这能傾其財力的「大出」之故。若不然，同樣看見出喪的人，大家必掩鼻而走，大駡「觸霉頭！」俗因求人不利，謀事不成，常嘆「出喪頭！出喪頭！」大概卽指此項非大出喪，或僅抬有一口白棺而過者言，可見喪事畢竟是兇事。</p>
<p>個人遇着不利的事，謂之「出喪頭」，國家遇着大不祥，如損失領土之類，天然亦可謂爲「大出喪頭！」國人觀此國家之大出喪，未識亦能「皆大歡喜」否也？</p>
<p>有人說「没人肯看大出喪，自然便没有大出喪」。我以爲此言很有至理</p>

<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>靜宜進房後，一雙黑眸子儘在修長的睫毛内打滖，這三天後與她切身關係的阿寳，怎不籌算一下？效蓀是個神經質的美術家，所注意到的條件是「眞」「善」「美」，靜宜是個良母賢妻的女子，她所注意到的自然不能以「美」爲大提題；某處將來在佔一張小床的地位，某處更爲共同生活上的關係要更動，效蓀所没有注意到的重要地方，靜宜依着克佳輕輕地說了。克佳就老實不客氣地　　「送什麽禮物？來一張小床罷。」</p>
<p>粗野的笑，神經質的笑，撒嬌的笑，無聊的笑聲中，阿福端着菜肴上樓來。</p>
<p>四個人很隨便的各佔了方桌的一面。菜肴並不豐富，却儘是各人合口的。自然楓涇蹄子也在其中。</p>
<p>「小弟弟，這一杯酬謝你今天的勞苦功高。」克佳淺淺的向效蓀篩了半杯。</p>
<p>「我自已來罷，」搖動着天然鬆曲的頭髮，效蓀從克佳手中把酒壺搶過來，</p>
<p>他向各人篩過一杯，在自已杯裏也傾滿了，一飲而盡，「慶祝克佳的「把戲」成功，我們應該痛飲一杯，」說着又滿滿的撙了一杯。</p>
<p>野牛牽動了一下嘴角，把要說析話嚥住在喉頭。靜文同時舉起酒杯來··</p>
<p>「慶祝小弟弟恢復康健！」仰子　子喝乾一杯酒。</p>
<p>「謝謝妹妹的姐姐，」效蓀又乾了一杯，篩起酒來。</p>
<p>「弟弟····」野牛牽動着嘴角。</p>
<p>「今天應該讓小弟弟盡興的喝酒，」靜文攔着說··「爲了小弟弟三天後要見一個見不得的女子。」</p>
<p>讀者滿以爲靜文是無聊地笑着，然而没有，她注視着朱效蓀的面，那樣的無表情。克佳是野粗地笑了，可是他不能說一句打趣的話，他目光從靜文面上移近效蓀，再從效蓀移近靜文。</p>
<p>靜宜擎着酒杯注視着每一個人。她不懂得，自然她不懂得。效蓀神經質地搖動着天然髮曲的頭髮，他乾了面前的酒，把酒壼一推說··　　「好，我不喝酒了。」笑着舉起筷來吃楓涇蹄子呵，妹妹歡喜吃的。</p>
<p>那才是無聊地笑。克佳也不自然的野粗的笑了。靜宜擎着酒杯，注視着三個人，她不懂得，自然她不懂得。</p>
<p>「妹妹，吃呵，楓涇蹄子。」</p>
<p>靜文將火車上的情形說了。四個人談着說着吃完了夜飯，靜宜提議去看電影，克佳和靜文贊成了後，效蓀當然少數服從多數。</p>
<p>三月的春風吹動了每顆靑年男女的心，吹動了霞飛路旁的小樹，吹動了朱效蓀天然鬆曲的頭髮，一切悲哀掉在歡樂的後面。他們送進了電影院。</p>
<p>在漆黑一團的電影院中，我不能告訴讀者些什麽。靜宜和克佳的談話是那樣低低地，像每對年靑伴侣一樣，除了雙方的能會意外，一個旁觀者是無從知道僅僅是「哥哥」或「妹妹」等的一個稱呼。效蓀和靜文在這種塲合似乎無話可說，偶然神經質的無邪的哭着，在讀者也無足驚奇的。</p>

<p>一九三四年蘇聯電影之展望</p>
<p>— 羅平譯</p>
<p>劇本討論會議席上</p>
<p>各名導演制作報告</p>
<p>决定一九三四年整個蘇聯電影事業的動向的劇本討論會（ＴｈｅｍｅＰｌａｎＣｏｎｆｅｒｅｎｃｅ）雖尙未結束，但如果要先知道一九三四年蘇聯電影事業的前途，可以從會上諸名導演的報告中窺到其一斑。</p>
<p>茲將諸名導演的報告介紹於左··</p>
<p>愛森斯坦··「我現在正從事於莫斯科的素描，我很希望能在一九三四年内將該片製成，雖然能否製成的問題固不僅依於我個人的。」</p>
<p>愛斯適歇勃··「我現今正在製作一個女人和一個新聞記者」（ＴｈｅＷｏｍａｎａｎｄＴｈｅＲｅｐｏｒｅｒ）。該片由編劇家賴平編編劇，是描寫蘇聯的婦女生活的情形，而那個新聞記者就是我，一個導演而兼業新聞者。我將我所看見的一切都翔實地報告出來。」</p>
<p>亞歷山大列夫··「我已完成一喜劇片『爵士』（Ｊａｚｚ），將在三月間公映；以後呢？我正在與加太夫寫一本喜劇，是關於集體農塲的，題名呌作『亞逹加』（Ｏｂａｒｋａ）或『四位新郎』（ＴｈｅＦｏｕｒＢｒｉｄｅｇｒｏｏｎｓ）。」</p>
<p>瑪啓萊脫··「我自已編的劇本『飛行的人們』（ＴｈｅＷｉｎｇｅｄＰｅｏｐｌｅ），已凖備搬上銀幕。該片是描寫飛行家的生活的，但有許多地方我都參攷了斯拉維恩君所作的劇本『彼得維諾來夫的私生活』。」</p>
<p>普特符金··「說起來好像很困難似的。我對於將來還没有個决定，但現已與凡拉特瑪克匃開始『航行術』（Ａｒｉａｔｉｏｎ）的攝製。」</p>
<p>洛姆··「一切都已經凖備好了。劇本是由司格利畢脫遜編劇的『羅犯』（Ｃｒｉｍｉｎｏｌｓ），意義及題材都採自高爾基的著作，是描寫ＯＧＰＵ勞動公社（ＯＧＰＵＬａｂｏｒＣｏｍｍｕｎｃ）的事件的。」</p>
<p>畢利夫··「現已凖備攝製一個依凡諾夫所作的劇本。該劇本是描寫莫斯科地下鐵道的建築。我决定在地下鐵道通車前（約在十月革命的十七週紀念日左右）攝製完畢，公映。」</p>
<p>柴拉符勒夫··「我現擬攝製一個奇怪的劇本名『飛航月球』（ＴｈｅＦｌｉｇｈｔｔｏｔｈｅＭｏｏｎ）亦名『靑春萬歲』（ＬｏｎｇＬｉｖｅＹｏｕｔｈ），由弗理曼諾夫編製，係一個科學的理想的故事。在這部影片裏可以看到一九五○提時代的莫斯科，以及火箭怎樣從莫斯科飛向月球。同時，并擬告訴各種型式的用處，和莫斯科的計劃，自戲院方塲到列寧墓，包括着新的建築物以及已完成的蘇維埃聯邦的宫殿。」</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「布爾醫生」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｄｒ·Ｂｕｌｌ</p>
<p>福斯出品·大上海映</p>
<p>我想凡是稍有人生經騐的人，看了這一影片，一定會大爲感動。</p>
<p>我們看罷，這布爾醫生是怎樣的爲人？他有着忠厚仁愛的天性，他不拘禮貌，但是他那毫不掩飾的純潔的心，却在這不拘禮貌之中充分的流露出來。這是多麽可愛的醫生啊！</p>
<p>他愛已愛人，能醫治人的疾病，同樣，他也懷着良善的心醫治少男少女的愛的心病。不管是大雪或是深夜，他孤獨的不畏艱苦的拯救世人，自少至老，自男至女，誰都在他的恩惠中而得着仁愛和健康。啊，這樣的醫生，我們應當如何爲他祝福呢？</p>
<p>但是，人們却不理解他的仁慈的心，人們却因不拘禮貌而侮蔑他的人格，因其和自已之唯一的同情者寡婦潔白無私的來往而譏諷咒駡他；這在他當然可以置之不理。但是愚笨而奸滑的人們却並不因此而罷休，更因有某新來之醫生的設備現代化和漂亮的汽車，在對此之下，布爾醫生被視爲不值一文的時代的落伍者了。也許，布爾醫生是相當守舊的人，然而他到底是高深科學研究者，何況當他表現了流行病源是高深科學研究生者，何况當他表現了流行病源的時候，那另一醫生雖有完善的機械設備，不也是束手無策麽？但是無知的男女却仍是近於迷信的譏笑他，奸滑的人們更爲了私利而攻擊他，於是他的地位低下了，只有那和善的寡婦才能同情他了。我們看罷，這是多麽嚴肅的人生！在這公理與正誼均被那自命爲正人君子之羣所毀滅乾凈的時候，像這樣仁和可愛的醫生·將使人們怎樣的感激涕零啊！浮士德誠心拯救世人，反被世人以石子投擲。這虚僞的社會眞是太殘酷了！</p>
<p>再說一名，我爲其深深的感動。</p>
<p>現在我們再來鑒賞這演出的技巧罷。</p>
<p>當畫面自黑暗中展開時，我們看到的是標明了「ＮｅｗＷｉｎｄｏ」ｗ字樣的火車站，這裏說明了故事發生的地方。其後火車駛來，停住没有人下來，只有一個郵包自窗口抛下，這說明了地方是荒落的鄕村了。火車慢慢的開去，</p>
<p>聲音自近及遠，與村中的敎堂的鐘聲相調協。鏡頭跟着郵局的女職員自車站提着郵包回去，於是敎堂，住屋，在鐘聲中呈露出來。没脛的雪，疎落的行人，整個的是鄕村圖晝。然後是郵局兼電話局，一個女接綫生和一個女郵局女職員，單調而和平的情感在她們臉上浮動。再後是敎堂，鐘聲，讚美詩的歌聲。···這些，將恬靜而幽美的冬天的鄕村景物，就在音響和畫面之協調的空氣中深深的抓住了我們的感情。</p>
<p>此外，我們再看導演是怎樣的描寫這主人公之性格的？他嘴裏哼着歌曲肩着一捆柴，他穿着大衣躺在寡婦家的梭發上聽她讀小說，他在敎堂中大聲唱詩，他在酒店中唱歌，他診病時低聲細語，他看着另一醫生新汽車不勝讚嘆欽羨，他吃飯時不知讓女人先坐，他屈着雙膝向寡婦求婚，他在人們攻擊他的塲合中不欲與人多辯，他獨坐在暗淡的燈光之下感覺失望和悲哀。總之，他是和平鄕村的忠厚人，他有着可愛的個性。這，完全是導演極聰明細膩的成績。尤其是寫他和寡婦之間的關係，以自然的合唱，不拘禮節的吃酒，睡在梭發上聽小說，這是如何融和而純潔的境地啊！</p>
<p>還應當提及的，那便是布爾醫生在給產婦接生的時候，先寫深夜中緊張的空氣，沉寂。小孩兒下地了，寫到屋外的微光，雞鳴犬吠，天已微明。二次再寫屋外已是天明了，晨曦在熌　，仍聞雞聲。布爾先生出來，有一個人在門前歡送。靜的空氣使我們身上發冷。這固然是導演最成功的手法，而那攝影的光與影的調協，又是何等美妙啊！</p>
<p>總之，這是一部極好的影片，但是又恐怕不爲一般好𤍠鬧的觀衆所愛好吧？果如此，那我眞要爲電影藝術在中國而惋惜了。</p>
<h3>評「錦繡前程」ＬｏｏｋｉｎｇＦｏｒｗａｒｄ國泰</h3>
<p>— 梨旦</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌是再也無法掩飾的事實，因而米高梅的資本家也不得不拿米作爲題材，「錦繡前程」便是描寫遭受到經濟恐慌打擊的一家百貨公司的命運。</p>
<p>緊縮政策是資本家在經濟危機中視爲萬應靈藥的。犧牲在它下面的是廣大的薪水生活者和生產者。</p>
<p>老簿記員彭登，雖然在甘白利，山維斯的百貨公司中服務已四十年，但是可怕的失業，畢竟無情地降到他的頭上了。</p>
<p>在辦事處，彭登正愉快地，帶着一點老人的自誇談論着職員裁汰的問題。做夢也不曾想到山維斯會呌他去，告訴他免職的不幸的消息。他的忠誠的服務心，還以爲山維斯在業務上有什麽吩咐，所以他是帶着那本大而厚的薄册去見山維斯的。當他聽到了這個不幸的消息，他的唇抖了，人也像中了電似的呆住了，山維斯呌他坐，他頽然地倒在椅子裏，他對於自已的耳朶也不能信任了；「難道我做錯了事嗎？」然而終於，他只得把薄册授給了山維斯，愴然走出百貨公司的大門。他看見賣報的，習慣地把手伸進口袋，忽然，妻孥的飢餓的呌號在他的耳邊響着現在他已是個失業者了！於是，重又把顫着的手伸出口袋。到了家門口，趦趄着不敢立刻走進，想想怎樣去告訴妻子說；「我已失業了。」在這裏，里昂，巴里摩亞（飾彭登）的表情是値得特别提出來稱贊的。他不僅用面部表情，他的枯瘦的手，老邁的背影，沉重的步子，刻畫了一個可憐的現制度的犧牲者。</p>
<p>然而，「錦繡前程」在後面告訴我們，這位被犧牲的老人，却是多麽柔順地爲他的主子辯護啊！自然，這樣一位忠誠的人物，米高梅的資本家是要給他一點報酬的，所以，「錦繡前程」便告訴我們，這位老人終於有了「否極泰來」的一日了。</p>
<p>不僅是這一位老人的「否極泰來」，山維斯他們那一個社會層的「否極泰來」的希望乃是「錦繡前程」所要傳逹給觀衆的東西。</p>
<p>然而這完全是一個幻想，正像甘露玲，山維斯的女兒，所看見的窗外的彩虹一樣。</p>
<p>資本主義的命運已走到日暮崦嵫的時期，天半的彩虹决不是Ｓｙｍｂｏｌｏｆｈｏｐｅｆｏｒａｂｒｉｇｈｔｅｒｄａｙ；我們可以在燦爛的光輝的背後，看到那幻滅，傷逝的悲哀。</p>
<p>當大地還是給暴風雨統洽着，天空是那麽陰沉沉地，什麽時候老天才會放晴，日光才會臨到人間呢？這是山維斯他們所盼望着的。</p>
<p>可是，這隨着暴風雨而來的太陽，决不會照到山維斯他們的身上了，「錦繡前程」祇是他們的可憐的自嘲而已！</p>
<h3>「棄愛」偉大舞廳佈景　派拉蒙攝爲有聲新聞</h3>
<p>— 吴鵬</p>
<p>國强公司攝製的棄愛，最後一塲偉大跳舞廳佈景，較任何國片舞廳佈景，均超出一籌，統計耗去千餘元之多。該片原擬不用此舞廳佈景，因國片用者過多，但因在意識方面，需用做一有力之描寫，蓋在一二八戰爭時，許多𤍠血男兒奔馳疆塲，亦不知有若干人歡笑舞塲中，遂不能不用。當該佈景之戲攝製時，美國派拉蒙公司駐華有聲新聞部王君，曾率工作人員往攝取有聲新聞數百尺，運往美國總公司，將隨正片在各國開映，亦開新紀綠也。不但該片導演紀範之，及主角趙英才·倪紅玉·莊曉人等工作情形將現於各國銀幕·卽該公司偉大之佈景，完善之設備，亦足爲中國影界增光也。</p>

<h3>克利斯丁娜ＱｕｅｅｎＣｈｒｉｓｔｉｎａ（四）</h3>
<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>他們在雪裏馳騁着，那少年女王的血管裏，充滿着生氣勃勃新興趣。這就是生命和享受新自由的一種快感。離開了國家大事的千斤担，離開了可厭的週流不息的責任的呼聲！回到她的故我，靑年的，鮮活的！不是什麽女王！一種放任的心，將她的精神鼓舞起來。低厭的樹枝在她經過的時候，將一陣一陣的雪塊，瀉在她的肩上。克利斯丁娜仰天狂笑着，馬跑得更快了。這樣的冒險奔馳，她的尋求是什麽！她要到什麽地方去？但是都不在乎。她是自由之身！</p>
<p>向前走着···向前走着···他們曲曲折折繞着山峯走着···皚然的白雪，憇在黝黑的衫樹枝上···一條一條的冰箸，亮晶晶垂着像無數的水晶柱···這是多末好的天然世界。現在已是夕陽漸落的時候，一圈白光之中，翻射着紫色的陰翳。克利斯丁娜勒住了馬，蒼茫四顧着。下面山谷中有一件東西，忽然吸引了她的視線。她拿鞭子指着那東西給歐拉夫看。歐拉夫順着她所指的地方看下去，祇見山谷之中，有一隊車輛，在深雪之中徐徐前進。前面幾輛車是極其富麗美觀的，後面的統通裝載！許多大小箱籠雜物。他們正在看着，忽估看見那隊車輛出了險。前面的一輛車，那是最富麗的一輛，裝璜得最美觀的，忽然陷在這旁的溝裏了。車傾側着不能前進，形勢極爲危險。許多夫役們，驅着那些馬，但是車身依然不動。一個少年，好似丰采甚都的，伸出頭來。他們又聽見一陣咒駡之聲，不像本鄕口音。歐拉夫帶着很不屑的口音說道··「外國人！」克利斯丁娜很高興道··「西班牙人」。那一定是西班牙的大使了。她想了一想，立卽鞭着馬跑下去了，歐拉夫跟在後面。</p>
<p>克利期斯丁娜跑到那隊車馬的旁面，用着淸脆的西班牙話吩咐他們拿一件外套墊在雪裏住的輪子底下，拿别輛車的馬借了幾匹過來然後她手一揮，那輛車突在地衝向前去。歐拉夫聽了她流利的西班牙語，都楞住了。而那位少年正倚在車窗外張望着，車子猛不防地向前一奔，將他衝倒了。克利斯丁娜笑了。那少年走了出來，克利斯丁娜又感覺到一種奇異的興趣。那個人是長長的，身材筆挺，面目俊秀，黑眼睛裏炯炯有光，唇上留了一些異國風光的小鬍子。他手插在腰上，對着克利斯丁娜看了一回，然後說道··「哦，你覺得這個很有趣嗎？」他顯然的是發怒的，但是聲音跳動得很好聽。「那都是趕車的混賬」！他咆哮着。克利斯丁娜柔聲的告訴他··「那不是趕車的錯處。這種事情是常常發生的，在冬天深雪的時候。」那少年道··「多末好的國家！多末好的道路！還有這種天氣」他冷得抖了。（未完）</p>

<p>Situation in Ningxia War Gradually Becomes Severe</p>
<h3>Military Council Suspends Supplies to Sun's Troops, Authorities in Beiping Deny Sending Song to Mediate, Sun's Troops Have All Entered Ningxia Province, Li Gang Fort Still in Hands of Ma's Troops</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Ningxia war is still ongoing. Sun's troops are in a standoff with Ma's troops in various villages outside Ningxia and the Pingluo area. Sun's army will decentralize into four routes to harass Pingluo. Li Gang Fort is still in the hands of Ningxia's army. Their main force has bypassed to the outskirts of Ningxia near the provincial capital, while part of the force has retreated to the northwest of the provincial capital to gather and await reinforcements. Sun's rear troops stationed in Wuyuan and Baotou are all moving west. However, Sun's army is facing difficulties in radio operations and vehicle movement due to a lack of gasoline. Supplies to Sun's troops have now been suspended. Their January salary and February supplies, totaling 320,000 yuan, will be used to subsidize the accumulated public and miscellaneous expenses of various armies. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Guanwu and others, councilors of the Military Council, previously met with Sun and advised him to resolve the conflict due to their close personal relations with both Sun and Ma. After several discussions, they returned without success. This afternoon, Zhang and others again intended to invite the representatives of both Sun and Ma stationed in Beiping to a dinner in their personal capacity to exchange views. Due to Bai Jianmin's temporary absence, the meeting adjourned without results. Now Sun's entire army has entered Ningxia, engaging in fierce battles with Ma for days. Why did Sun's army violate orders and advance west? Orders were repeatedly issued to withdraw to the north of Dengkou to await orders for reorganization, reducing the number of troops to seven regiments. However, Sun's army disobeyed the orders and continued to aggressively attack the Ningxia provincial capital. Why did Sun defy military orders? A notice was issued last night to Shen Zhenrong, head of the 9th Group, and the Transportation Department of the Military Council to stop the supply of allowance, salary, and clothing expenses to Sun's army, and to instruct all routes to stop all transportation for that army. Sun's army's monthly salary is more than 130,000 yuan according to the new salary regulations of the 23rd year, and the supply allowance is 80,000 yuan per month. If Sun does not realize his mistake, the final measures will be taken. Regarding the rumor of Song mediating, a certain party denies it. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable sources, regarding the Sun-Ma incident, there was a rumor that Song was mediating. A certain important person telegraphed Song to inquire. Song replied tonight, denying sending anyone to Beiping to mediate. Song himself plans to come to Beiping with Qin Dechun within this week. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities in Beiping denied mediating the Sun-Ma incident tonight. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Baotou said that Sun's entire army has left the Sui border and entered the Ningxia provincial border, which proves that the war is intensifying. It is heard that staff members within Sun's army are advancing west with the army, including the red-leaning Xuan Xiafu, Han Linfu, Qian Qingquan, Nan Hanchen, etc., who are now holding important positions within Sun's army. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news, Since Sun Dianying's troops violated orders and advanced west, causing the Northwest war, the military authorities here have repeatedly telegraphed Sun, ordering him to withdraw to the north of Dengkou, and to reorganize according to the Military Council's approved strength of seven regiments for the unit. Although Sun replied by telegram, expressing his compliance, in fact, he is still actively attacking the Ningxia provincial capital. A few days ago, the Military Council telegraphed Sun again, reiterating the previous order, but Sun did not reply. The authorities believe that Sun has disregarded the law and endangered national security, which is unforgivable. On the 3rd, an explicit order was issued to suspend the supply of provisions to the unit and to stop all transportation to the unit, to see what happens next. (4th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) The Ningxia war has been fierce for days. Sun's army attempted to cut off the connection between Pingluo and Ningxia, launching several fierce attacks, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. They are still in a stalemate. (2nd dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The 7th Route Office in Guangdong is scheduled to be established on the 6th. (Xiamen) On the 3rd, drivers from the Zhangzhou-Quanzhou Railway escaped from Longyan to Zhangzhou. According to them, except for Zhou Lixing's more than two thousand troops who intend to join Guangdong in Da Xiaochi, there are no troops of the 19th Route Army in Longyan. There are only a small number of volunteer corps. Since the 31st, the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag has been hung in Longyan city, and no Guangdong troops have arrived in Longyan. (4th dispatch)</p>

<p>A Temporarily Revised Plan for Taking Over Yu Guan</p>
<h3>Takeover to Be Implemented on February 10, Temporary Organizations to Be Abolished Immediately, Tao Shangming and Ii Wo Finally Agree</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Tao Shangming traveled between Beiping, Tianjin, and Yu Guan, spending a lot of effort, the method for taking over Yu Guan was finally fully agreed upon recently. Tao went to Yu Guan again at the end of last month. When he made the final negotiations with Ii Wo, the head of the Japanese special service agency, on the 30th, he revised the Yu Guan takeover plan once again. A total of six articles are as follows. The Chinese and Japanese sides revised the Yu Guan takeover plan on January 30. 1. The takeover of Yu Guan will be implemented on February 10 of the 23rd year. 2. All administrative affairs in Yu Guan will be restored to their original state before the incident. 3. The aforementioned administrative organs shall immediately move to their original offices after the day of the takeover. 4. All local temporary organizations in the vicinity of Yu Guan during the incident shall be abolished at the time of the takeover. 5. Local people in Yu Guan who have provided legitimate services to the local area may be selected and employed after the takeover. 6. Some of the Japanese agencies operating in Yu Guan still have a temporary need to use them. They will be vacated when arrangements are made to relocate. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng Discusses the Situation of Inspecting Various Counties</p>
<p>There Is No Problem in Taking Over Gubei Kou and Ma Lan Yu</p>
<p>The Remaining Passes Will Also Be Negotiated by Analogy</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said, I have inspected Yutian, Xinglong, Zunhua, Jixian, Malanyu, and other places. The counties have suffered heavy losses due to the war, and the rural economy is almost bankrupt. We are currently seeking remedial measures and will formulate a plan to implement it step by step. There is a camp of puppet troops stationed in Malanyu, about 40,000 people, and a company of Japanese troops. There is a battalion of Japanese troops stationed in Gubeikou. There is no problem in taking over the two places. Once the date is agreed, it can be implemented. After the two places are taken over, we will proceed to take over the other passes. I will pay respects to Huang tonight and He tomorrow to report everything. I will go to Tianjin to discuss the Yutian matter with Yu Shang. The Yutian Militia has been disbanded, and the Security Team is currently stationed in the city. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that the Eastern Mausoleum is magnificent in architecture. The annual cost of guarding the mausoleum is about 300,000 yuan. The land planted with forests in the mausoleum stretches for dozens of miles. During Cao Kun's era, a Forest Reclamation Bureau was established. From the eighth to the fourteenth year of the Republic, almost all the trees were felled, with a value of millions. The bureau reported only 120,000 yuan to the government each year, and the remaining funds were mostly embezzled by them. There are more than 30,000 Manchu soldiers in the Luying of Malanyu, of which more than 10,000 are unable to make a living. I plan to find ways to provide relief. After Yu Guan, Gubeikou, Malanyu, etc. are taken over, I will negotiate with the Japanese side by analogy to take over the Great Wall, Xifengkou, Lengkou, Jielingkou, etc. The Xinglong County outside the Great Wall and the Dushan Administration Bureau will have to wait for the second step to be handled. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to official persuasion, half of the merchants at the Yutian Duck Hong Bridge have resumed business. However, people are still very panicked. All shops close at 3:00 PM.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The German-Austrian Conflict and the European Political Situation</h3>
<p>Since Germany has been in the grasp of Hitler, the basic tone of its foreign policy has been nothing more than attempting to develop the power of the National Socialist Party throughout Europe, establishing affiliated regimes in foreign countries. Because it is bound by the Treaty of Versailles, it has to adopt this invasive, disguised policy in order to carry out territorial expansion, as a plan to break through the enemy's encirclement. However, it has ultimately aroused Italy's jealousy, forming a clear struggle between the two major fascist systems in today's European political situation. Its clues can especially be seen in the diplomatic relations with Guangdong. This is indeed a serious issue concerning the European situation.</p>
<p>Austria has always been an ally of Germany, but since Germany's active activities, Italy, with its ambitious position to dominate Europe, cannot turn a blind eye. Therefore, it has been trying its best to exert influence on Austria. As a result, the relationship between Austria and Italy is like a combination of water and milk. Hitler knows this and cannot give up this key, actively instigating party members to carry out activities openly within the Austrian border, even causing domestic factional disputes in Austria through diplomatic relations. Therefore, the Dollfuss government, which is currently close to Italy, sent a note to Germany on January 17 of this year, requesting the German authorities to publicly declare that they would no longer interfere in Austria's internal affairs. Germany recently sent a reply to Austria, stating that the German-Austrian dispute is a historical movement and that "a certain political system places all movements that can make the German nation revitalize under the law and does not protect them. Can Germany stand by and do nothing about this political system?" The reply concluded by saying, "Germany is conducting an investigation, but Austria filed a lawsuit against another country's government without waiting for the results of the investigation, which Germany finds strange." Germany's attitude is so stubborn. It is appropriate that after the reply arrived, the whole of Austria considered it unsatisfactory. Before the large-scale demonstration of 100,000 farmers in Lower Austria (according to the Reuters telegram from Berlin on February 2), Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss shouted, "We are fighting for Austria's honor and freedom. The Austrian people are all of the German nation. It was like that in the past, and it will always be like that in the future." His excitement and indignation were unstoppable for a time. The German-Austrian relationship has almost reached the point of armed conflict. Under the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles today, Hitler is not on good terms with the Soviet Union in the east and is at odds with France in the west. Its diplomacy is extremely isolated, yet it dares to make things difficult for Austria and instigate its party members to engage in activities, indirectly displeasing Italy. How overconfident is he? However, Hitler has never rashly made arrangements without any planning in the diplomatic aspect as a preparation for negotiations with Austria. Looking at the sudden establishment of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of Ten Years on January 26 of this year, neither too early nor too late, just at this time of tense German-Austrian relations, it can be seen that Hitler's reconciliation with his eastern neighbors is indeed purposeful, and it can also be clearly seen that the development of the German-Austrian conflict will increase from now on.</p>
<p>Moreover, Hitler's active plan for Austria is not only aimed at Austria. All countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary are Hitler's prizes. They are located in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, located in the center of the Danube River, and have long been brotherly states with Germany, with a significant impact on European hegemony. What Hitler wants to obtain and be satisfied with is not just a day. Now, it is obvious that he is uniting Poland in the east and invading Central Europe to drive out Italy's power. Where will the countries of Central Europe go from here on? And what will be France's attitude? According to our prediction, it seems unlikely that France will favor either side for the time being. France's view of Germany is probably similar to France's affection for Italy.</p>

<h3>Dumping of Japanese and American Rice in China</h3>
<p>One and a Half Million Koku Distributed in the Yangtze and North China Regions</p>
<p>Five Hundred Thousand Koku Shipped to Major Ports in Guangdong and Fujian</p>
<p>(Tokyo) To raise rice prices, aid farmers, and prevent rural uprisings, the Japanese government has decided to adopt an overseas dumping policy. Of the more than ten million koku of surplus rice, they will first ship one and a half million koku to major commercial ports along the Yangtze River and in North China for discounted dumping, with the losses to be covered by the government. The Taiwan government will also ship five hundred thousand koku of Penglai rice to major commercial ports in Guangdong and Fujian provinces for dumping, with the losses to be shared by Taiwanese farmers and the Taiwan government. (Hualian Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to abundant rice harvests, landlords and tenants in Japan are facing extreme hardship. The Japanese government has decided to sacrifice the people of its colonies, Taiwan and Korea, to benefit Japanese landlords and tenants, and is firmly altering its rice policy. It will heed the demands of both the ruling and opposition parties to revise the Rice Control Law, with the aim of restricting the import of rice from Taiwan and Korea to Japan, preventing competition with Japanese rice and the resulting drop in market prices, thus maintaining Japanese rice prices, i.e., maintaining the official price level, and averting unrest among farmers. The management of colonial rice is under discussion between the agricultural and colonial affairs ministries and the governments of the two colonies. However, fearing increased resistance from the governed populations, the two governments disagree with Japan's demands and are striving to reduce the extent of their sacrifice. Agriculture Minister Goto, however, resolutely represents the interests of the ruling nation and is determined to submit the colonial rice management proposal and the rice policy revision proposal to the cabinet meeting on the 6th for approval, and then force the two colonial governments to accept them. It is reported that the agricultural minister's strategies include: (1) government management of colonial rice; (2) reducing rice production in the colonies and promoting the cultivation of miscellaneous grains; (3) a special permit system for colonial rice exports; and (4) implementing special rice policies in the colonies. One of these four proposals will be implemented. (Hualian Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Reform of Japanese Institutions in Manchuria</p>
<h3>The Military Advocates a Unitary System</h3>
<p>Rejecting the Quadripartite System</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of reforming the tripartite system of Japanese institutions in Manchuria, which has become a problem in the House of Representatives' budget committee, the military's opinion is as follows: If the institutions in Manchuria are to be reformed, it should be done when extraterritoriality is abolished. While amendments may be made, the current quadripartite system and separatism are absolutely unacceptable. A unitary system should be adopted, i.e., the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Zone should be merged, and a new administrative organ established. Its head should not be concurrently held by the commander of the Kwantung Army, but should be a civil official. The ambassador should also be relieved of his concurrent position as military commander and a dedicated ambassador appointed. A new organ should be established to supervise the head of the new administrative organ, the ambassador, and the South Manchuria Railway, with the commander of the Kwantung Army as its head, to implement a unitary system.

<p>The Focus of the Japanese Diet Shifts to the House of Peers</p>
<p>Relations Between Political Parties and Military Cliques Gradually Improve</p>
<p>The Cabinet is Optimistic About the Political Outlook</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Two weeks after the reopening of the 65th Diet session, the House of Representatives plans to end questioning at the general budget meeting on the 5th and enter the second phase of debate. The House of Peers, however, has no bills to consider and has been focusing on issues of discipline, with intense debate. On the 5th, Mr. Seki Naohiko will pursue the government on issues such as the purification of discipline and educational scandals. If Trade Minister Nakajima's response fails to dispel doubts, the problems will worsen. Issues such as the purification of military discipline, the separation of the military and the people, the Manchurian problem, national defense, rural problems, and financial problems will be addressed by Viscount Okouchi, Baron Kikuchi, Baron Iwakura, Baron Tsukimatsu, and others, who can be said to be the elite of the House of Peers, launching a comprehensive offensive. Therefore, the center of the Diet is likely to shift temporarily from the House of Representatives to the House of Peers. How the government will arrange its defense is uncertain, but judging from the current situation, the House of Peers will inevitably encounter considerable difficulties. (Japan United Press Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The attitude of the Lower House towards the government has softened somewhat. Issues such as military interference in politics, declarations of separation between the military and the people, and military discipline are unlikely to escalate further. As for rural countermeasures, the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, and Agriculture Minister have accepted the proposals of both parties and have decided to promptly propose countermeasures to resolve the rice price, silk control, and colonial rice management issues, which can be said to have reached a conclusion. Regarding countermeasures to the 1935 disarmament order and the issue of territorial rights over the South Pacific islands, the Navy Minister and Foreign Minister have given concrete replies, leaving the political parties with no grounds for criticism. However, the issue surrounding Trade Minister Nakajima personally still needs to be addressed. The budget for the next year is scheduled to be sent to the Upper House on March 13th, and the attitude of the Upper House is worrisome. However, since the resignation of Minister of War Araki, the feelings of political parties and zaibatsu towards the military clique have also softened somewhat, and the Japanese government is gradually becoming more optimistic about the future.

<p>Internal Strife Within the Seiyukai Party</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The internal conflict within the Seiyukai party between the faction of President Suzuki and Minister of Education Hatoyama, and the faction led by Takejiro Tokonami, which advocates cooperation with other political parties, has become increasingly acute. Various meetings are being held, all with the aim of expanding the influence of their respective factions. Following the meeting of the Suzuki faction, the Tokonami faction, feeling provoked, has scheduled a meeting at the Toto-tei in Hibiya at 6:00 PM on the 6th to discuss countermeasures. Thus, the state of opposition has become even more evident. Various disturbances are bound to occur, causing those concerned about the party to worry about this trend. (Dentsu Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>[Minister of Commerce's Gaffe Draws Criticism]</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Trade Minister Nakajima's praise of Takauji Ashikaga has become a central issue in this Diet session. Some members of the Seiyukai party have expressed strong opinions, stating that the Trade Minister's praise of Takauji will have a negative impact on the national concept and national belief, and should not be taken lightly. When Yukio Ozaki (Gakudo) was Minister of Education, he also made a gaffe about republican politics, which led to his resignation. Given this precedent, Trade Minister Nakajima should be thoroughly impeached and forced to resign, even if it results in the collapse of the cabinet. Therefore, the attitude of the hardliners in the Seiyukai party is particularly noteworthy. (Dentsu Telegram, 4th)</p>

<h3>Postal Service to Northeast China Strictly Blocked</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the blockade of the postal service to the Northeast provinces, there are recent reports that postal service has in fact resumed in the Northeast. According to an official from the Ministry of Communications: (1) Except for the South Manchuria Railway area, where a postal agreement was previously in place, the postal service to the rest of the Northeast has indeed been blocked, and smuggling has been tightened. At the beginning of the suspension, letters from the northern part of the Eastern Provinces were still found with our country's postage stamps, and some even had counterfeit Manchukuo postage stamps. The Directorate General of Posts has recently issued strict orders to instruct all post offices to stop delivery of all mail from the Northeast as described above. (2) Last winter, Japanese ships occasionally carried letters privately to the Northeast from ports such as Qingdao and Tianjin. This Ministry has requested the Ministry of Finance to instruct all customs offices to pay close attention whenever Japanese ships leave port, and to confiscate or destroy any privately transported mail.

<h3>Military Technology in the Soviet Union is Rapidly Advancing</h3>
<p>Land, Sea, and Air Forces are More Than Capable of Eliminating Enemies</p>
<p>Any Invasion of Soviet Territory Will Be Unfortunate</p>
<p>Voroshilov's Speech at the Communist Party Congress</p>
<p>(Moscow) People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs Voroshilov's speech during the debate on Stalin's report at the 17th Communist Party Congress was released by various newspapers today. Voroshilov took the stage amidst prolonged applause and cheers from the audience. "The 17th Party Congress is a truly historic event, the first congress of Bolshevik unity and the great victory of socialism. It has been ten years since Lenin's death, and the historical task, the heavy burden, has been shouldered by his disciple, his friend, and his loyal believer, Comrade Stalin. With an indomitable spirit, Comrade Stalin has overcome unprecedented difficulties, while holding high the banner of Lenin, leading our party, the proletariat, and the people of the Soviet Union to new victories. The unity and solidarity of our party have not only led to rapid progress in the construction of our socialist industry, collective farms, national defense system, transportation organization, and education system, but have also strengthened the unity and consolidation of the working masses, organizing the people of the entire Soviet Union in both material and spiritual aspects, and have had the most favorable impact on our country's international position. The strength of our party and its rock-solid unity have not only been valued by the international proletariat and friendly parties, but even our class enemies have had to consider them in their relations with the Soviet Union." (The first two paragraphs on agriculture and transportation are omitted.)</p>
<p>Surpassing the Military Equipment of Various Countries</p>
<p>Voroshilov then discussed military and national defense issues. He stated that with the Central Committee's constant attention, the standard of the Soviet armed forces is in line with the level of national development. During the period from the 16th to the 17th Congress, the Red Army has undergone thorough improvements. Comparing the current state of the Red Army with its state in 1930, Voroshilov stated that the basic problem of technological transformation of the Red Army has been resolved. At present, we have a sufficient number of new-style tanks, we have high-quality artillery, and a completely sufficient number of excellent machine guns (including light, heavy, tank-mounted, aircraft-mounted, and commercial machine guns), and these weapons are all made in our own country. We have a strong chemical industry and transportation facilities that are not too bad.</p>
<p>The Air Force is Powerful</p>
<p>Although the Soviet Union's air force in 1930 was not bad, the quantity was insufficient. At that time, the ratio of various air weapons in the air force was not very appropriate, that is, reconnaissance aircraft accounted for too much, and there were no bombers, and there were very few fighter planes. However, after the past three and a half years, the appearance of the air force is unrecognizable. We have created a powerful bomber force and have also refreshed all other aviation combat power.</p>
<p>Progress in Technical Equipment</p>
<p>Voroshilov then used percentages and figures to illustrate the progress of the Red Army's technical equipment. The audience applauded. Voroshilov stated that when he expressed the change in the nature of the Red Army, he stated that the average mechanical power of the mechanical equipment of all the Red Army soldiers was 2.6 horsepower in 1929, while now it is 7.74 horsepower.</p>
<h3>Increasing National Defense Strength</h3>
<p>Voroshilov then talked about ways to strengthen Soviet national defense, pointing out to the Congress that the existing defense zones are not limited to the western border, that is, from Lake Ladoga to the Black Sea, and that they are also set up in the most threatened areas of the Far East and Eastern Siberia. He also detailed the Soviet Union's active increase in coastal defense in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea, in the Murmansk region, and especially in the Far East. Voroshilov said that such defensive work would make it difficult for adventurers who attempted to attack Soviet territory. He also mentioned the increase in naval defense and emphasized that the Soviet coastline extends for thousands of miles, making the navy extremely important. He continued, "In the past few years, we have not only consolidated and strengthened our navy in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, but have also sent several ships across the Baltic Sea-White Sea Canal to the north to remedy the defects in the north, and at the same time, the direct threat of an attack on the coastal provinces has forced us to station land and sea forces in the Far East. At this moment, I must declare that we are not satisfied with the current immature fleets in the north and the Far East. We have no naval attack tools there, such as capital ships and aircraft carriers. However, the world knows that we do not want to attack anyone with the land and sea forces. What we want is to defend our coasts and borders. We are confident that our current coastal defense forces (mainly our naval aviation and submarines) in these areas are sufficient to annihilate the enemy who attacks us and have more than enough to spare."</p>
<p>The Greatest Achievement of Industry</p>
<p>When Voroshilov discussed industry, he said that the creation of a strong socialist industry was the greatest achievement of the working class. "Our country's industry is the best department in the entire national economy and is also the pride of all the working masses in the Soviet Union. As for the military industry, it has technologically transformed the army and provided excellent technical weapons. "The reason why the Bolsheviks have become Bolsheviks is that they are not limited to their existing achievements and can always demand greater and better results."</p>
<h3>Skilled in Combat Training</h3>
<p>Voroshilov detailed the Red Army's cadres and their work and characteristics in conquering new technologies. "Our country's army is unique because it is a technologically proficient army, and its technology is learned with its own interest, hobbies, and enthusiasm. This is illustrated by the fact that in 1933 alone, the Red Army personnel made a total of 152,000 technical inventions and rationalization proposals. Most of these proposals are very useful and have been successfully adopted." Voroshilov continued to talk about the progress of the army's tactical training, saying that the soldiers have learned new aiming techniques and have a full understanding of the weapons they use. "However, we must never think that our success is 100% complete. On the contrary, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. However, the main fact at this time is that the army is psychologically connected with the new technology, and at the same time, they are attaching this technology to their own will." (Overview of the Red Army Organization) Voroshilov then detailed the social composition of the Red Army personnel and paid special attention to the rapid increase in the number of workers. He said that workers and collective farmers have accounted for the largest majority of Red Army personnel. He pointed out that the number of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the Red Army has also increased, and the increase in the number of military schools is also considerable. When Voroshilov then detailed the large amount of cultural work in the army, the expansion of cultural and educational institutions, the large increase in the budget for political education organizations, and the increase in clubs, art troupes, theaters, and libraries, he said, "The struggle to win socialist culture, to win the cultural thinking methods of Red Army soldiers and officers, and to create socialist new people is the highest task of the party headquarters and command posts in the army."</p>
<p>Japan's Ambition is Unsatisfied</p>
<p>Voroshilov also touched on the situation in the Far East. He said, "Before we explain the army in the Far East and the steps we have taken to prevent trouble before it happens, I must briefly describe our neighboring country in the Far East. Japan is the first country to pick war as a way to solve the crisis, which has become well known. It is a major buyer of military goods and raw materials for the military industry in the world market. At the same time, Japan's political work in preparing for war, which is extremely circumspect, has become obvious to all. In the past few years, Japanese military writers, military journalists, scientists, factory owners, civil servants, and politicians have all openly declared the necessity of Japan's war against the Soviet Union, and have often discussed in detail, in literature and speeches, with ridicule and straightforwardness, the occupation of the coastal provinces, the Outer Baikal region, and even the entire Siberia. In such a situation, if we still want to make people believe that we have never seen anything and are still as reliable as our friendly neighbors, wouldn't the world think it is too strange? Japan has now become the actual master of Manchuria. Not only that, but it does not understand and cannot fulfill its obligations to guarantee the Soviet Union's interests on the Chinese Eastern Railway, and even helps Manchukuo with all its strength. It should be noted that Japanese 'merchants' not only do not conceal their behavior when they are actively preparing to attack us, but also openly declare it to the world. However, at the same time, they blame their conscience and accuse the Soviet Union of having a military plan to attack Japan. The defensive works we have set up in the border towns are in the eyes of the Japanese. It is also true. If we have no defensive power at the border between the Soviet Union and Manchuria, like the Chinese border defense in 1931, then Japan will be satisfied. Unfortunately, our friendship will never go this far, and I will never give anyone this kind of satisfying thing."</p>
<p>Actively Preparing for War Against Russia</p>
<p>Voroshilov then detailed the reality of Japan's preparations for war. He said that they are engaging in the preparation of economic and military bases, the reorganization of armed forces, the rearmament, and their replenishment strength. Finally, they are actively building training grounds in Manchuria. The so-called preparation of military and economic bases includes the purchase of military raw materials from abroad (these raw materials are lacking in Japan), the preparation of its own industrial and economic organizations, and the increase in the military budget from 443 million yen in 1930 to 937 million yen in 1934, which accounts for 44.5% of this year's total budget. The military industry for building tanks and aircraft is expanding rapidly. Japan's land, sea, and air forces are all being reorganized, rearmed, and increased in number. Voroshilov also cited figures and facts to illustrate this. He continued, "All of the above has become a well-known fact. At the same time, Manchuria has gradually become Japan's most powerful base. The Japanese troops in Manchuria have far exceeded the limit necessary to 'protect the interests of Japanese people in this independent country.' However, the Manchurian army and armaments are constantly increasing."</p>
<p>Preparing for a Possible Attack</p>
<p>All these facts related to the events that have already happened and continue to happen in Manchuria and China force us to continue to carry out defense, pay close attention to everything that happens in Japan, take the necessary steps at home, and make all preparations. Until today, our Central Committee, first of all Stalin's smart policy on international relations, has enabled us to escape from all conspiracies and has not allowed us to be involved in the vortex of war. Today, just as Stalin said, we have become a factor for peace in the world. All countries that do not want war and do not want to form military groups, no matter what their reasons are, their duration is now inevitable. They have to gather around us. We are like its main trunk, and the surrounding countries are trying to use this to ensure that they avoid aggression and war, which they want or cannot engage in.</p>
<h3>The Near East is Safe</h3>
<p>Stalin has listed the countries in his report and made an impartial evaluation of our relations with various countries. Everything in the Near East is very peaceful. Our relations with Turkey are the most friendly and united. Our relations with Persia and Afghanistan are also not bad. As for our relations with our European neighbors, Stalin has discussed them in detail, and you are familiar with them.</p>
<h3>War Clouds Gathering in the Far East</h3>
<p>The Far East is full of war clouds, and the storm of war may break out at any moment. Although we have the efforts of diplomats, we have not been able to make the Japanese authorities understand that peace is better than war. At the same time, for the Japanese imperialists, our war is by no means an easy, simple, and small-scale war. If we have to participate in this war, it will be a huge and tragic war. At the same time, this is a war to attack the Bolsheviks, and under the current conditions, this war will cause deep wounds to the initiator. Our neighbors in the Far East want to easily sacrifice others in order to gain huge profits. Please keep this fact in mind. (Long and loud applause)</p>
<h3>Initiating War is Asking for Collapse</h3>
<p>If the Japanese imperialists decide to launch this extremely risky and difficult military adventure, they must wait until all preparations have been completed before launching it. Therefore, this war must be serious. However, if the enemy really wants to occupy our territory, we will let our Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's vanguard on the border in the Far East, that is, how far the Red Army in the Far East has progressed in eliminating them. Voroshilov then said that in the past two years, and until today, the Central Committee, first of all Stalin, has been constantly paying attention to the area occupied in the Far East. "We have considerably strengthened our armed forces in the area. I am sorry that I cannot cite figures. We have also taken some steps to defend our border in the Far East. In more important areas, we have set up obstacles to make it difficult for the enemy to cross into Soviet territory."</p>
<p>Defending Every Inch of Territory</p>
<p>Voroshilov continued to talk about the basic measures to strengthen national defense in the Far East, and said, "I have already used a few incomplete words to explain the national defense work that our country has done in the Far East." Voroshilov also quoted Lenin's statement after the Japanese army withdrew from Vladivostok in 1922, that "Vladivostok is far away from here, but the city is our country's city." Voroshilov continued, "This city of our country, as well as the entire coastal provinces, North Sakhalin, Kamchatka, in short, we must defend every inch of the entire Far East territory at any cost, and we will inevitably be able to defend it."</p>
<h3>The Final Victory is Assured</h3>
<p>After speaking, the audience erupted in cheers that lasted for quite a while. Mr. [伏] continued, "I know that all of us (as if one person) must deeply believe that we will not only protect our Far East, but also, if we are forced to join the war, we will surely win. Our enemies are sacrificing us to gain victory, while also crushing the sweet dream of communism. This can only be explained by their infinite stupidity and profound ignorance, as well as the fact that they are destined to fail. Only their narrow-mindedness and slowness (which are inevitable products of the fate of capitalism) could allow our class enemies to suggest such an idea. Our Party, the working class, and all the working people of the Soviet Union have become a great force, a huge solidarity, a strong force, and an army of organized warriors. Therefore, although our construction work has some minor defects, they are only like some minor scratches on the building we have already built. In the future, we will gain new victories every day. At the same time, no matter where we find the biting of stupid pigs, they cannot intimidate us Bolsheviks or stop our unstoppable progress," he said. Mr. [伏]'s concluding remarks were drowned out by loud cheers. (TASS dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Next Year's Naval Reduction Conference</p>
<h3>Hirota's Response Policy</h3>
<p>Opposing Proportionalism and Avoiding Mention of the Manchurian Issue</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, in order to eliminate the so-called crisis concept of 1935-36, is closely linked with the army and navy authorities and is eager to establish concrete countermeasures for the next naval disarmament conference. The core of this is as follows: (1) "The Fundamental Issue of Naval Reduction": The Washington and London conferences adopted a proportionalism based on ship types. In practical terms, this ratio reduces the concept of national defense security of various countries and induces contradictions that provoke competitive shipbuilding. This fact proves that proportionalism is difficult to achieve the purpose of disarmament. Therefore, if we really want to achieve the purpose of disarmament, we must review new methods to replace proportionalism. Japan, based on the principle of maintaining sufficient military strength and the special nature of national defense geography, must advocate the limitation of total tonnage and the qualitative limitation of offensive ship weapons. (2) "The Manchurian Issue": The so-called Manchurian issue has been resolved by the independence of "Manchukuo." Japan will not allow any form of review of this issue at the next disarmament conference. (3) "The South Seas Mandated Islands Issue": Through the agreement of the world's major powers, Japan, which has been entrusted with the right to rule, should not lose its right to rule even if it withdraws from the League of Nations. Hirota's diplomacy is centered on the above points, and its development is generally expected. (Dentsu dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>U.S. Air Force Expansion Plan</p>
<p>Army Aircraft to Increase to 4,800</p>
<p>Service Personnel to Increase to 38,000</p>
<p>Submitted to the House for Discussion</p>
<p>(Washington) The House has submitted a bill stipulating that the number of U.S. Army aircraft be increased from 1,800 to 4,834, and the number of active personnel be increased from 15,000 to 38,063. This is because the Air Force Commander proved that the U.S. Army could not assemble more than 300 aircraft at one location for service in a short period of time. Therefore, the House has this proposal. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Composition of the U.S. Army</p>
<p>Divided into Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve</p>
<p>Focus on National Mobilization Plans in Wartime</p>
<p>Washington Correspondence The U.S. Army is composed of the following three elements: (1) the Regular Army, (2) the National Guard, and (3) the Organized Reserve. The Regular Army is a standing army composed solely of professional soldiers. This army is divided into nine infantry divisions including artillery (some incomplete), three cavalry divisions (partially incomplete), one independent cavalry brigade, two independent artillery brigades (one incomplete), and twenty-one aviation battalions (one of which is composed of airships and other regiments). This army is distributed throughout the country. Among them, those in East Asia are as follows:</p>
<p>China Two infantry battalions,</p>
<p>Philippines One infantry division (including three infantry regiments and one regiment each of artillery and engineers), one cavalry regiment, three regiments of naval heavy artillery, one anti-aircraft artillery regiment, one aviation regiment, one chemical warfare company, and others.</p>
<p>Honolulu One infantry division (including four infantry regiments, three field artillery regiments, one engineer regiment, and one tank company), four regiments of naval heavy artillery, one anti-aircraft artillery regiment, two aviation battalions, one chemical warfare company, and others.</p>
<p>The number of these troops stationed in the Philippines and Honolulu accounts for about one-fifth of the total Regular Army. These troops also have various new facilities (such as chemical warfare motorcade, etc.).</p>
<p>As for the total strength of the Regular Army, it has been about 130,000 in recent years. However, the Chief of Staff of the Army is currently requesting an expansion to at least 170,000, considering that the number is too small to complete its tasks.</p>
<p>The second type, the National Guard, is usually under the jurisdiction of each state and is responsible for maintaining public order. In necessary cases, the President has the right to use it for national service. Usually, more than half of its maintenance costs are borne by the national treasury. Its organization and equipment are all based on the Regular Army. Its soldiers are composed of local volunteers. In addition to receiving more than 144 hours of in-camp education and 15 days of field training each year, they can engage in their own occupations in their spare time. Its total number is slightly less than 190,000. Its organization is 18 infantry divisions, 4 cavalry divisions, and 19 aviation companies.</p>
<p>The third type, the Organized Reserve, is purely wartime force. The majority of the U.S. Army's wartime strength of 4.5 million is this type of Organized Reserve. Usually, it is composed of volunteer officers and non-commissioned officers as the backbone. Its total strength is currently more than 120,000. Most of the various units such as the 27 infantry divisions and 4 cavalry divisions formed in wartime have already completed the formation plan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the main body of the U.S. Army is not the peacetime army, but its strong national power behind it. Therefore, the U.S. Army can only exert its true value in the event of national mobilization. Regarding the research and education of national mobilization, the U.S. Army has the Army Industrial College, which was founded in 1924 and is subordinate to the Under Secretary of the Army. The students are mainly Army officers, and Navy and Marine Corps officers can also join. The instructors are regular military instructors and specialists in finance and economics. It is one of the most important institutions in the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>In addition, for the military education of the general public, there are Citizen Military Training Camps and the National Shooting Incentive Association. In order to train reserve officers, there are Reserve Officers' Training Corps in general schools, currently with 120,000 members. The new officers of the United States are selected from those who have completed the above-mentioned Citizen Military Training Camps and the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Fifty people can be selected every year. In addition, there is the United States Military Academy, a regular school for training Army officers, located on the west end of the Hudson River near New York. The study period is four years, and its education is the strictest in the country. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>Partial Reorganization of the Daladier Cabinet</p>

<p>彭古 [Peng Gu] Succeeds as Minister of the Army, 馬尙陶 [Ma Shangtao] as Minister of Finance</p>
<p>夏柏 [Xia Bo] Transferred to Governor of Morocco, Declining Due to Illness</p>
<p>(Paris) It has only been a week since the establishment of the new Daladier cabinet in France, but it has had to be reorganized today. The reason is that Daladier transferred the Paris Police Chief to Governor of Morocco, while the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Army fought hard to resign. Daladier refused, and the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Army resigned as a result. In addition, there is also the director of the technical education department of the specialized education department who has resigned as a result. Rumors are rife that Daladier will submit the resignation of the entire cabinet tonight, and submit a new cabinet to the parliament again on Tuesday. (National News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The transfer of the outgoing Paris Police Chief Xia Bo was originally a means for Prime Minister Daladier to appease the opposition party. Unexpectedly, Xia suddenly expressed his rejection of this important position. Xia has been following the doctor's instructions and resting behind closed doors since last Friday. This is a huge blow to Daladier. The press has not yet learned what reason he is using to reject the appointment. (National News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<p>Austria Dissatisfied with Germany's Reply, Prepares to Appeal Directly to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Citing Article 11 of the Covenant</p>
<p>Requesting the Assembly or Council to Hear the Case</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Austrian government, due to Germany's obstruction of Austria's independence, sent a memorandum to Germany on January 17, requesting the German government to issue a declaration formally recognizing Austria's independence and declaring that it would no longer interfere in Austria's internal affairs. Germany recently prepared a reply to this memorandum, the content of which was published yesterday. The Austrian government expressed unanimous dissatisfaction with Germany's reply and has decided to submit the case to the League of Nations next Monday afternoon, citing Article 11, paragraph 2 of the League of Nations Covenant, requesting it to hear the case.

<p>Former British Foreign Secretary Eden to Travel East Tomorrow</p>
<p>Consultations with France, Germany, and Italy</p>
<p>Explaining Various Points of the Disarmament Memorandum</p>

<p>(London) According to sources here, the British government is planning to send disarmament expert Lord Eden to the capitals of various European countries so that the governments of various countries can consult with Mr. Eden for detailed explanations when they have questions about the clauses proposed in the British disarmament memorandum sent to various countries. According to the Daily Mail, Eden is scheduled to leave the country next Tuesday, first to Paris, then to Berlin and Rome. It is said that the mission of this trip is not only to get various countries to accept Britain's disarmament proposal, but also to solicit the opinions of various countries on the proposal of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to convene a five-power conference. It is said that the United States is also among those invited to Mussolini's proposed five-power conference. (National News dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Divergent Views on Disarmament Issues Between France and Germany</p>
<p>(Paris) The German government responded to the memorandum submitted by France on January 1 on the 19th of the same month. The French diplomatic community has three special criticisms of the German reply: the arms inspection system, military groups other than the formal army, and French colonial troops. Everyone believes that Germany still maintains its original opinion and directly advocates that German armaments should be equal to those of other countries. Regarding the arms inspection system, the French memorandum proposes that the system to be adopted in the second phase should be entirely based on the results of the trial implementation in the first phase. Germany believes that this approach is uncertain and sufficient to hinder the general disarmament process. Germany strongly states that even if the disarmament convention is implemented frankly, it is sufficient to cause conflicts. Germany believes that under the conditions of complete equality, the arms inspection system can be implemented from the date the disarmament convention takes effect. Therefore, Germany is still returning to its original proposal, and it can be said that there has been no progress in the disarmament issue. Regarding military groups other than the formal army, Germany only stated that these groups have absolutely no military nature and that if these groups need to be inspected, then similar groups currently existing in other countries must also be inspected. According to the report of the Committee on Armaments in Geneva on February 9, it was acknowledged in the report that the training received by various German groups was of a military nature. When the vote was taken, eight representatives abstained. Germany made a reservation on this point and included it in the report, but the entire report was approved by the entire committee. For example, there is a passage in the report that says, "Practice in various fields and lands, which is called 'Defending Germany's Physical Fitness' in Germany, is regarded as formal training even if no military equipment is carried." This passage is naturally also included in the approval. Regarding colonial troops, as far as France is concerned, they can be divided into three types: (1) troops stationed in France, (2) troops stationed in colonies and protectorates, and (3) troops that are mobilized at any time, numbering about 70,000. These troops are stationed in mainland France as a reserve force for overseas troops. Once there is an alarm in a French colony, they can be transferred to provide support. Since the French government recognized the two principles of limiting armaments and the inspection system, it has not distinguished between these three types of troops.

<p>An Important Page in European History The New Balkan Union</p>
<p>Non-Aggression Treaty About to be Established</p>
<p>Bulgaria May Also Join</p>
<p>Belgrade, the Capital of Yugoslavia The text of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between the countries of the Balkan Peninsula will be ready for deliberation and signing approximately tomorrow. Informed sources believe that this treaty will be flexible in the manner it establishes to guarantee the security of the Balkan countries, so that all countries in southeastern Europe can join it. The new treaty first declares that the countries of the Balkan Peninsula will maintain their solidarity with each other in accordance with the procedures of the League of Nations, and that the working methods established by the treaty are the same as those established by the Little Entente Treaty. The foreign ministers of the contracting countries will meet once or twice a year to discuss the issues that need to be resolved. People here say that the Balkan Non-Aggression Treaty may allow Bulgaria and Albania to join in the future.

<p>Roosevelt's Trade Control Plan</p>
<p>Establishing Banks to Implement Initial Steps</p>
<p>Novel Ideas State-Run Commerce</p>
<p>(Washington) In order to encourage American foreign trade, the U.S. government will use funds from the national treasury to establish a Federal Export Bank to assist American exporters, as noted in yesterday's dispatch. This move by the government is the first step in implementing a controlled commerce policy. This control plan is not yet fully in place. President Roosevelt's advisors unanimously believe that establishing a commercial agency is the best way to control American foreign trade. This plan was conceived by Roosevelt during the preliminary negotiations before the London Economic Conference last year. At that time, the advisors all thought it was impossible, and it was shelved. Now, the advisors all agree with the President's opinion. In general terms, Roosevelt's plan is to establish an agency that has the function of a clearing house. Its task is to organize the sales of American goods in foreign markets and to guarantee the countries that sell American goods so that their goods can also be sold in the American market. Although Roosevelt's plan is a quantity restriction method for imports, its ideas are very novel and have never been seen before. Its method is not only to allow foreign goods to be sold in the American market within a certain quantity, but also to guarantee that the United States will definitely purchase this certain quantity of goods. In other words, it is a state-run commercial system. At present, the most debated point about this plan is whether private individuals are also allowed to participate in this organization. Some companies advocate that the government and private individuals jointly organize it, while Roosevelt advocates that it should be strictly organized by the government. In addition, there is another point that is not yet clear, that is, the scope of the new Federal Export Bank will include the commerce of all countries in the world or will it focus specifically on countries that have special interests with the United States, such as South America and Soviet Russia. According to what was said in yesterday's dispatch, it seems that South America, the Balkan Peninsula, the Far East, and other regions are all included. Today, the general public speculates that the new bank will have a limited scope of activity at the beginning, and then gradually expand it when it is deemed beneficial, in order to include American commerce all over the world.

<p>Sharp Increase in Foreign Gold Inflow</p>
<h3>The Value of the U.S. Dollar Will Change</h3>
<p>(Washington) Since President Roosevelt devalued the U.S. dollar, the amount of foreign funds flowing into the United States has increased sharply. As a result, the financial market has been disrupted, and the predetermined value of the U.S. dollar of five cents and nine dimes and six mills may change even more. Recently, President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau have been quite anxious about this matter and are currently consulting with various advisors and experts. It is said that the New York Federal Reserve Bank reduced the discount rate to one and a half percent last Thursday to prevent the inflow of large amounts of funds into the United States and to expand credit borrowing, so that gold can be active.

The price of silver bars will be 10% to 25% higher than the current world market price. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3>The Poisonous Japanese Drug Trade Devastating North China</h3>
<p>Abridged and translated from Document No. 21 of the Geneva International Anti-Drug Propaganda Bureau, originally written by Mr. Allen (E.W. Allen): The Chinese people are currently being poisoned wholesale by so-called Japanese merchants. For my own understanding, I recently conducted a thorough investigation into the sale of narcotics, especially heroin, in the provinces of Hebei and Shandong, including the source of supply, the causes of tuberculosis among the Chinese people, and how drugs are sold and used by addicts. My investigation revealed some startling facts that were so unexpected that most people would find them hard to believe. In Hebei, the total volume of sales and consumption is far greater in Tianjin than in any other city. Tianjin is followed by Beijing, which is adjacent to Tianjin.</p>
<p>(1) Opium Dens Lining the Streets: The Japanese concession in Tianjin is practically the center of all the vile drug trafficking in the city. Qiushan Road, where the French and Japanese concessions meet, is under Japanese jurisdiction. When the drug smoke swirls, it creates a deadly live drama. Walking along the road from the corner of Asahi Road to the end of Qiushan Road, one can see many modern shops with dazzling Chinese, Korean, and Japanese gold signs, all bearing names like "Huatai Trading Company." These are all opium dens where heroin is sold in small quantities, starting from one cent. From seven in the morning until midnight, one can walk into any of these trading companies and see Chinese people, from rickshaw pullers to silk merchants, smoking heroin. Once, I happened to walk into the first trading company at No. 3 Qiushan Road, which had a "Huatai Trading Company" sign. The owner of the trading company was Korean, surnamed Li. The manager of the trading company was Chinese, surnamed Wang, and he received a monthly salary of thirty yuan from the owner, Mr. Li. When I walked in, I found more than thirty Chinese people smoking heroin in the front room. The manager immediately cleared a chair for me and offered me about half a centimeter of heroin, asking for one yuan. I sat down, pretending to be a drug user. At that time, a Chinese man was sitting behind me, sleeping. He was wearing expensive silk clothes. When he woke up and saw that I was a foreigner, he immediately ran towards the door, but the manager stopped him and said that I was also a heroin addict. Then the young Chinese man smiled. He asked me in fluent English if I had a habit of using heroin. When he heard my negative answer, he sighed. He told me, "I am a local Tianjin resident, twenty-one years old. My father is a well-to-do merchant. I work in the accounting office of the Beijing-Fengtian Railway Bureau. About eight months ago, I felt a little unwell. My friend advised me to smoke a cigarette containing heroin. On the first day, I smoked several cigarettes and really became ill. The Korean man who had sold me heroin heard that I was ill, and he told my friend that if I wanted to fully recover, I would have to continue smoking heroin for a few more days. Unexpectedly, I listened to his advice and became addicted to this bad habit. Now I have to spend three yuan a day to smoke this drug. Before I became addicted, I was very interested in sports and liked to play basketball, but now I feel no interest in anything in life." As a result, the young man listened to my advice and went to the hospital. After staying for four weeks, his addiction to drugs was completely cured.</p>
<p>(2) Exchanging Clothing and Jewelry for Heroin: I have encountered thousands of similar cases, including young male and female students. The so-called Japanese merchants use the method of leading the Chinese into the grave, which is to give the Chinese heroin. If the Chinese are short of money, they are asked to pawn their clothes or jewelry. Behind an old Kyoto Hotel near Hade Gate in Beijing, there is a two-story building dedicated to drug use. The owner is Korean. He told me that at least four hundred Chinese people buy and smoke heroin there. There are many Japanese and Korean shops in Beijing that run this drug business. The most prominent place is Suzhou (transliteration) Hutong. The Japanese government is, of course, complicit in the success of this drug business. In Jinan, Shandong, there are about 5,000 Japanese residents, 90 percent of whom claim to be merchants but are actually drug traffickers. Although the Shandong authorities impose the death penalty on Chinese people who are caught smoking or selling heroin, there are already thousands of Chinese people in Jinan who have been taught and seduced by the Japanese into becoming addicted to drugs. These thousands of Chinese people are already addicted to drugs and cannot quit, and every day there are still no fewer than thousands of Chinese people who are being seduced into becoming addicted.</p>
<p>(3) Era of Economic Recession: A Japanese drug dealer told me that the Japanese consulate police know all the Japanese who sell heroin, but they pretend not to know about their drug business. The Japanese merchant also said that in this era of economic recession, Japanese people must make a living, and selling drugs is a profitable business. The Japanese have a lot of influence in Shandong. I am truly amazed that there is a Japanese person in Jinan who is employed and paid by the Public Security Bureau. His job is to take care of the interests of the Japanese and to handle disputes between Chinese and Japanese people. Along the Jiaoji Railway, almost every town and village is inhabited by Japanese people. Ninety-nine percent of these Japanese people are drug traffickers. They force Chinese people to smoke drugs, forcing Chinese people to poison themselves to death. In addition, they are very diligent in telling Chinese people to smoke drugs, causing them to become addicted. In Manchuria, Japanese weapons of war killed tens of thousands of innocent Chinese men, women, and children, and looted the property of tens of thousands of Chinese people, forcing them into starvation. In the North China region, the Japanese are again carrying out a massacre of tens of thousands of men and women, but not with guns and cannons, but with a very gentle and reliable weapon. If this barbaric act of poisoning China by the Japanese does not stop, in another five years, more than half of the young people in North China will be poisoned, and another quarter of the people, even if they do not die from poisoning, will only be useless waste. I (Mr. Allen refers to himself) think that now is the time to take all kinds of steps to stop this barbaric act of the so-called Japanese merchants poisoning the Chinese people. If they (the Japanese) do not engage in legitimate business in Chinese territory, even if they are foreigners protected by extraterritoriality, they should be expelled from Chinese territory. There is no country in the world that can tolerate such merchants residing for a minute.</p>
<p>(4) Learning New Bad Habits: The Chinese people are peace-loving people. Because they are hospitable, they easily welcome even strangers as honored guests. Because they are willing to learn, they easily listen to the teachings of even strangers. This is the main reason why those so-called Japanese merchants have been able to corrupt the Chinese people and make them addicted to drugs with great success.</p>
<p>In North China, almost all heroin is smuggled out of Dalian and then passes through Tianjin and Qingdao. According to reliable sources, the Japanese have several drug factories in Dalian, and the heroin they sell kills more people than opium every month. Once a person becomes addicted to heroin, it is very difficult to quit. I have spoken to thousands of people who are addicted to this drug, but I have never heard of anyone who has smoked heroin for five years and is still alive. All the people who spoke to me told me that they were all told to become addicted by Japanese and Korean people. All the heroin supplies come from Japanese and Korean people. They all sincerely expressed their desire to quit heroin if there was a way.</p>
<p>In some opium dens, I even saw fathers and sons smoking Japanese drugs together. In Tianjin, I also saw a person giving some heroin-containing cigarettes to his thirteen-year-old son to smoke.</p>
<p>Women from all walks of life often run into opium dens to smoke drugs. I saw many beautiful and elaborately dressed women, only about fifteen years old, smoking heroin. They also told me that they had become addicted to drugs a few months ago. Their faces were deathly pale, their nerves were weak, and two of them had to smoke more than three centimeters of heroin in about two hours.</p>
<p>Yuguan Handover Scheduled</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Claims Results Are Extremely Satisfactory</p>
<p>But Japanese Troops Still Stationed in Dongluocheng Barracks</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Although the Japanese side has put forward conditions regarding the handover of Shanhaiguan, causing a standstill, both sides have been constantly exchanging opinions in secret. Tao Shangming recently went to [blank], met with the Japanese side, and generally agreed on the detailed rules and all procedures for the handover. Tao then went from Yu to Tianjin to meet with the provincial government, Xi Yu-zhong, and reported the results of the contact. Yu has expressed his agreement. Last night (2nd) at 11:00 PM, Tao returned to Beijing and visited Huang Guo, He Yingqin for instructions this morning. Huang and He have no objections to the handover plan, which is now scheduled to officially take place on the 10th. Our side's personnel are designated as Tao Shangming, Su Yuqi, and Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County. The Japanese side will be responsible by Ii, the head of the Japanese Army's Shanhaiguan Special Service Agency. Ii will notify the Yuguan puppet organizations and the puppet maintenance association in advance to handle the relocation and closing matters. The Japanese Army's new barracks and various houses of the puppet organizations in Dongluocheng have been completely completed. The Japanese troops stationed in Yu had already moved there a few days ago. The Japanese Army Special Service Agency will be located in the Four Forts south of the Yuguan Railway, while the garrison will remain in its original location without being transferred. The Dongluocheng and other issues at the center of the negotiation will be left unresolved due to the difficulty of the actual situation. According to Tao Shangming's statement as follows: "I went to Yu a few days ago and met with Ii, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency stationed in Yu, for detailed discussions on the Yuguan handover issue. All handover procedures have been generally agreed upon, and the results are extremely satisfactory. It is expected to be handed over in the middle of this month. This morning (3rd), I separately visited Commissioners He and Huang to ask for instructions on everything. Tomorrow, I will go to Tianjin to prepare. During the handover, I will first go to Yuguan with Su Yuqi, Yuan Tai, and other personnel to handle all procedures with the Japanese personnel. After the handover, the wartime state will be fully restored. The Linyu County government will be moved to the city and a special police force will be established to maintain order. The Japanese troops in Shanhaiguan have now moved to the new barracks. The puppet organizations and the puppet maintenance association in the city will be notified by Ii within days to relocate and close down separately. The Linyu County Government is still located in Haiyang Town. For the convenience of office work, County Magistrate Yuan Tai is currently living in Qinhuangdao. Once the handover is completed, he will move east immediately. Since the suppression of bandits in Ledong, gradual reorganization has been carried out, and local administration has gradually improved," and so on.</p>
<p>The issue of the Gubeikou handover has also been underway recently. Yin Rugeng, the Commissioner of Jiji Administrative District, was previously ordered by Xi Yu-zhong, the Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, to investigate the Yutian corps police conflict incident. He then went to Zunhua, Malanyu, and Sanhe counties on the 31st for inspection.</p>
<p>Now, because the Japanese side has requested to discuss the Gubeikou handover issue, he was summoned back to Beijing at 6:00 PM today and visited Huang Fu at the Political Reorganization Council at 8:00 PM. According to his secretary, He Yi, the Gubeikou handover is expected to be implemented by the end of the month (February 3rd).</p>
<p>Kailuan Coal Mine Strike Settled</p>
<p>Workers' Conditions Divided into Two Parts</p>
<p>Work to Resume First, Negotiations to Follow</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Kailuan Coal Mine strike has been ongoing for more than half a month. As of January 31st, all workers at the Majiagou Mine have resumed work. Workers at the Tangjiazhuang and Linxi mines have resumed work by three-tenths. Although there is no movement at the Zhaogezhuang Mine, officials believe that it will resume work within a few days. The strike was initially started by workers at the Majiagou Mine due to the failure to restore the labor union. They used the issue of dividing bonuses as a pretext and clashed with the police stationed at the mine, leading to the strike. Li Yinmin, the resident mining officer of the Department of Industry, and Li Runchun, a technician from the department, went to the mining area to mediate, which could have been resolved. Later, the Hebei Provincial Party Department sent Xu Wenhong and Shi Taian, Party Affairs Instructors for the Mining Area, to guide Party affairs and restore the labor union. However, after the war last year, the Hebei Provincial Government ordered the Tangshan Special Public Security Bureau to order all labor unions in the Kailuan mining areas to temporarily suspend activities because the area was within a non-war zone and it was feared that labor union activities would cause unexpected problems and stir up international disputes. However, the workers were told that this did not mean dissolution. Now that the Hebei Provincial Party Department has sent personnel to guide, the workers took the opportunity to demand that the labor union must be restored, saying that without the labor union, the workers would have no protection and incidents similar to the police shooting and killing workers at the Ma Mine would continue to occur. The resident mining officer telegraphed the provincial government for instructions, and the provincial government replied that activities were still not allowed. At the same time, the Party affairs workers sent by the Hebei Provincial Party Department had contacted the workers and were organizing. Thus, the strike became a standoff over the issue of whether or not to allow labor union activities. The workers successively submitted five demands and nine conditions to the mining bureau. The incident became more and more evolved, and it went further and further away from the original issue. On January 25th and 26th, the Tangjiazhuang, Zhaogezhuang, and Linxi mines went on strike to assist the Majiagou Mine in the negotiations, with the restoration of the labor union as a prerequisite. They successively carried out strikes and issued declarations, slogans, and other items, and stated that if the mining company did not accept the conditions, they would demolish the branch lines connecting the mining area with the Beining Railway, so that the coal stored in each mine could not be transported out. The mining company felt more and more difficult to deal with. The provincial government, upon receiving the report, feared that the workers would gather and riot, which could not be suppressed by the small number of mining area police, so it telegraphed Song Naigan, the director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, not to provoke incidents and to carefully maintain order. At the same time, it telegraphed Tao Shangming, the Administrative Inspector of Linyu, to direct Song Naigan and the resident mining officer of the Department of Industry to mediate the strike nearby. Tao then telegraphed back, saying that if the workers sent by the Hebei Provincial Party Department did not withdraw, the strike would not be easy to mediate, and the workers would never listen to mediation. The provincial government then telegraphed the Central Party Department, ordering the Hebei Provincial Party Department to recall Xu and Shi. When the workers saw that the Party affairs instructors had left, they knew that it would be difficult to insist on restoring the labor union, and their attitude became more moderate. Seeing that the opportunity had arrived, the mining bureau invited worker representatives to Tianjin for direct negotiations. On the morning of the 30th, seventeen worker representatives arrived in Tianjin. Moss, the General Manager of the mining bureau, and Washington, the General Manager, exchanged views on a trial basis. That night, they resumed negotiations. It was immediately decided that the mining company would accept the five clauses submitted by the workers: (1) Restore jobs for unemployed workers; (2) Issue the February 1933 bonus; (3) Pay wages as usual during the suspension period; (4) Abolish the contract system and allow the labor union to recommend workers to do small contract work themselves. The mining company also instructed the workers that the three items regarding compensation for injured and deceased workers, withdrawal of the captain of the mining area security police team, disbanding the police team, and restoring the labor union were not within the conditions of the mining company and should be negotiated directly with the government as a separate issue. The worker representatives, after being allowed to resume work under the aforementioned four clauses, telegraphed the workers in each mining area that evening. Therefore, at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 21st, the workers at the Ma Mine were the first to resume work. Zhaogezhuang made no statement. Tangjiazhuang Linxi had three-tenths of the workers resume work. In addition to instructing a small number of worker representatives to stay in Tianjin to sign the conditions, the mining bureau had the rest rush back to the mine at noon on the 31st to persuade the workers to resume work (January 31st).</p>
<p>Anhui Province Has Completed 3,000 Miles of Highways</p>
<p>Guanqing Dispatch: Highway construction in Anhui Province has been underway for many years, but progress has been slow. The main and branch lines have relatively complete engineering equipment, while other military roads are mostly temporary creations with simple engineering and a lack of connections. Last year, the Department of Construction, based on the resolutions of the Seven Provinces Highway Conference and taking into account the social needs of Anhui Province, re-planned the roads that have been built and are to be built.

The section from Wanzhi to Xuancheng, 31 kilometers long, was built and opened to traffic by a commercially operated automobile company. Recently, the Ministry of Railways has recovered the Wu-Wan section and is working with the Jiangnan Railway Company to rebuild the Wu-Zha Railway, so traffic has been temporarily suspended and another roadbed is being built. The Xuan-She section is 128 kilometers long. Due to the overlapping peaks, it has been under construction for many years and was finally opened to traffic at the end of 1933. The She-Xiu section is 40 kilometers long. The roadbed has long been completed and is open to commercial traffic. The section from Xiuning via Qimen to the Jiangxi border is also being surveyed and repaired jointly by personnel from Anhui and Jiangxi.</p>

<h3>The Survey Team Will Set Off Separately</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The War Zone Relief Committee was originally scheduled to end its six-month term on the 6th of this month. Due to the fact that industrial revitalization and agricultural revitalization have not yet been carried out, the Executive Yuan has approved an extension of two months. However, due to the need to repair roads and rivers for industrial revitalization, it may still be difficult to complete the work by then. As for the road repair plan, it was originally planned to form three survey teams to survey the routes, with two teams heading east from Ping (Beiping) and one team heading west from Tangshan. However, the mutiny of Yu Tianhu and Xie Wu's troops led to the suspension of the departure. Now that the deadline for industrial revitalization is extremely pressing, it has been decided that they will set off separately within a few days, in order to complete the task on time.

<p>The Rise and Fall of Bandits on the Border of Henan and Hubei</p>
<p>Zhang, Wang, Li, and Ji Were Exterminated One After Another</p>
<p>Mao, Zhang, Yang, and Gu Fled West Across the Railway</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports on the situation on the border of Henan and Hubei. In recent years, the area has been harassed by Red bandits, causing widespread suffering. In addition to the Red bandits, there are also local bandits who, although raising a different banner and not communicating with the Red bandits, are equally harmful to the local area. The bandits vary in size, from dozens, hundreds, to thousands of people. They are equipped with infantry, cavalry, guns, and spears, and sometimes gather in the mountains and forests, and sometimes invade cities. The northern Hubei counties of Sui, Zao, Gu, Guanghua, Jun, Yun, Anlu, and Yingshan, and the southern Henan counties of Shangcheng, Gushi, Guangshan, Luoshan, Xinyang, Tongbai, Neixiang, and Xichuan have been almost completely harassed. The most prominent bandits are those led by Zhang Ruiwu, Gu Desheng, Mao Xingsan, Yang (surname unknown), Liu Xinghan, Chen Hanqing, Zhang Xueliang, Li Letian, Wang Jieyan, and Ji Dagang. Initially, they were concealed by the Red bandits, so they were not noticed by the world. After the Red bandits were cleared, the bandit leaders, knowing that they would be next, rose up in revolt. Except for the whereabouts of the bandits led by Liu Xinghan and Chen Hanqing being unknown, the three groups of Zhang Xueliang, Li Letian, and Wang Jieyan, who harassed Gushi, Wangliuji, Qiaogouji, Guanyintang, Huolonggang, Wangjiapeng, Caomiaoji, Wamiao, Shifodian, and Zhanglaobu, and Nandamiao, were completely exterminated by the 45th Division under Dai Minquan. Yang, Gu, Zhang (Ruiwu), and Mao, learning from the failure of Zhang (Xueliang), Li, and Wang, united with the remnants of the communists within Luoshan County, totaling 4,000 people and hundreds of mules and horses, and fled near Guangshui, crossing the Pinghan Railway westward by night. They have now entered the territory of Anlu, intending to flee back to their old nests in Sui and Zao. The 44th Division under Xiao Zhichu and the 82nd Division under Rong Jingfang of the road protection army are pursuing and suppressing them. Fierce fighting has been going on for days. This group is quite strong, and it may take time to completely eliminate them. The Ji Dagang group is also strong. Recently, they occupied Guanyintang and Heihuzhai, which belong to Jun County. After several hand-to-hand combats by the 51st Division under Fan Shisheng stationed in Xiangyang, they retreated to Motianling. After further pursuit and encirclement by the people, the bandits became disunited internally. On January 29th, their followers killed the bandit leader Ji Dagang, took his head, and surrendered. The entire group disintegrated. In summary, six out of ten of the bandits on the Henan-Hubei border have been eliminated. Only the Zhang (Ruiwu) and Yang groups are still struggling. The remaining scattered small groups are not worth mentioning. (February 2nd)</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Divides into Five Agricultural Zones</p>
<h3>And Dispatches Personnel for Guidance</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, considering that the agricultural promotion in various counties has been ineffective, has divided the province into five zones in order to actively reorganize the work. Each zone will be guided by an industrial guidance technician or specialist assigned by the department. If the agricultural promotion work in each zone is not carried out well, the guidance personnel in each zone will be held jointly responsible. The zoning, the names of the responsible guidance personnel, and the number of counties are as follows: Zone 1: Zhenjiang, Liyang, Jurong, Lishui, Shangchun, focusing on forestry, guided by Zhou Pei; Wuxian, Wujiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Jiangyin, focusing on sericulture, guided by Xu Jinzhong. Zone 2: Changshu, Kunshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, Jiading, Fengxian, Chuansha, Shanghai, general agriculture, guided by Guan Yida. Zone 3: Nantong, Chongming, Haimen, Rugao, Jingjiang, Jiangdu, Taixing, Jiangpu, Luhe, Yizheng, general agriculture, guided by Xu Zhen. Zone 4: Yancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, Huaiyin, Siyang, Baoying, Taixing, Shangyou, general agriculture, guided by Ding Nianjia. Zone 5: Tongshan, Guanyun, Shuyang, Peixian, Fengxian, Xiaoxian, Pixian, Suining, general agriculture, guided by Hu Yugui. The above totals 46 counties. There are still six counties that have not established offices: Yangzhou, Taicang, Nanhui, Donghai, Dangshan, and Jintan. Eight counties, including Funing, Suqian, Ganyu, Lianshui, Baoshan, Qidong, Yixing, and Danyang, are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education. Others, such as the Jiangning Autonomous Experimental Zone, are not included in the zoning.</p>

<p>The Duntulu Railway and Rajin Port (Jilin Correspondence)</p>
<p>The Duntulu Railway held its opening ceremony on April 20th of last year. It was officially announced in August of the year before last. Rajin is the terminal port of North Korea. The president of South Manchuria Railway, Hayashi Hirotaro, personally went to inspect the ports of Chongjin, Rajin, and Unggi. At a time when the clouds of war are permeating the Far East, this fact has aroused the greatest attention of the world. The reporter therefore went to the site to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The information obtained is sufficient for the world to study. According to the Japanese request to build the Jihui Railway, there have been many setbacks. The section from Jilin to Dunhua (210 kilometers) was completed long ago. After the September 18th Incident, the entire Northeast fell into the hands of the Japanese. Under military suppression, the South Manchuria Railway survey team began preliminary surveys in the Yanbian area. Although our Righteous Army under Wang Delin constantly sabotaged the work and killed two of its technicians, the Duntulu Railway was finally built and completed under the protection of the Japanese army and the so-called "Manchukuo" army. The initial plan of the Jihui Railway was to start from Jilin, pass through Dunhua to Hoeryong in North Korea. After the September 18th Incident, the plan was changed. It was built from Dunhua to Haimo Cave on the other side of the Tumen River in North Korea, with a total length of about 390 kilometers, passing through 13 tunnels and 83 bridges. The difficulty of the work is unparalleled. Although there are no large cities along the railway, the undeveloped arable land is twice as much as the cultivated land. Moreover, the virgin forests along the railway have never been logged for thousands of years. The extent of the area and the amount of storage are even more astonishing. However, the greatest value of the completion of this road is to shorten the distance between North Manchuria and Japan's interior. The road is connected to the Jichang Line in the west, directly reaching the pseudo-capital of Changchun, and crosses the Tumen River Railway Bridge in the east, connecting with the North Korean Railway. Manchuria and Korea can be integrated from now on. As for the distance between the Japanese interior and North Manchuria, it has been greatly shortened compared to the past detour through Dalian. In other words, the economy of Manchuria has been further controlled by the completion of this road. The Japanese also spent considerable research on the terminal port issue of the road. At the beginning of the construction of the Jihui Railway, the Japanese secretly surveyed. At that time, there were three terminal ports designated: Chongjin, Rajin, and Unggi. Among them, the ports of Chongjin and Unggi had already been built, but Rajin was still a wilderness. Chongjin is the first commercial port in North Korea, with a population of more than 33,000. The trade volume in 1931 reached 13 million yuan. However, because the area of the wharf area in the port is too small, and it is subject to the wind and waves from the Gaomo Peninsula and the pressure of the currents, and the nearby coast is silted up by the sediment discharged from the Shusong River, it is necessary to carry out huge dredging projects to build a wharf. Therefore, it is unlikely that Chongjin will become a terminal port with a throughput of tens of millions of tons. Although Unggi has a short history of opening up, its development has been rapid. The population is about 30,000, and in recent years, the water capacity has been 57 million yuan. Moreover, there is a vast plain near the port, and the water volume is supplied by the Sanjiang River, which, according to Zhang Yun, can provide drinking water for 30,000 people. However, this natural good bay also has a fatal flaw: the bay faces southeast and is not enough to resist the north wind. It is difficult to build a breakwater in the bay, and the Ryongsu Lake is an inner harbor, which will freeze in winter. Therefore, it is also obvious that Unggi cannot become a terminal port. Therefore, the location of the terminal port is none other than Rajin. Although the water supply in Rajin is slightly difficult, its situation is several times better than that of Dalian. If the river water flowing down from Unggi is drawn from the North Iron Pillar Cave on the back mountain, and a water dike is built in Haifeng, five miles to the west, then the water supply in Rajin is not a concern. In terms of terrain, Rajin is really hard to come by. The bay penetrates 10 kilometers into the inland sea, and the two islands of Dacao and Xiaocao stand at the mouth of the bay, so the wind and waves inside the bay are unusually stable. Daokaishan, Shifushan, and others surround the three sides, like a natural barrier. The scenery is better than that of Dalian. However, this is only in terms of terrain and scenery. If viewed from a commercial and military standpoint, it is even more important. The reporter is a layman in military affairs, but the fact that the Imperial Russian fleet once used it as a base during the Russo-Japanese War, and the British Far East Fleet was stationed in the bay 30 years ago, shows its importance. From an economic point of view, when the construction of the port began, it was planned to complete the equipment with a throughput capacity of 9 million tons in 15 years, which is far from comparable to the 800,000-ton capacity of Chongjin. Compared with Dalian's current 11 million tons, it is only 200 tons away.</p>
<p>Dalian has taken 20 or 30 years to achieve its prosperity. Rajin still needs a long time to compete with it. However, the distance between the northwestern ports of Japan and Rajin is about half the distance compared to Dalian. It takes about 70 hours to travel from Changchun to Tokyo via Dalian, but it now takes about 39 hours. Therefore, it can be asserted that the connection between northern Manchuria and Japan's interior will be closer due to the completion of the Duntulu Railway and its terminal port of Rajin.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven years ago, the Japanese used Dalian as a base to operate the South Manchuria Railway to seize the resources of our Northeast, causing our Northeast continent to change its color. Now, under the rule of its puppet regime, the Japanese are using Rajin as a base to build a second South Manchuria Railway in the eastern part of our Northeast.</p>
<p>From then on, the five million square miles of land and 30 million compatriots in our Northeast will be in an irrecoverable situation. Recently, the atmosphere of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union has become increasingly tense. There is a sense that the mountains are about to collapse and the wind is filling the building. Therefore, the Japanese are accelerating the completion of the Duntulu Railway and rushing to build Rajin Port. On the one hand, the purpose is to consolidate the ruling power of Manchuria and implement the continental policy of aggression in the Northeast. On the other hand, it is to prepare for the future war. It is necessary to quickly complete this major artery that occupies a military advantage. When the people of the country hear the whistling of the locomotives on the Duntulu Railway, they should also be vigilant.</p>
<h3>The Yuehan Railway Is Determined to Be Completed Within Four Years</h3>
<p>Active Construction on the Zhushao Section</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence. The southern section of the Yuehan Railway has been opened from Guangzhou to Shaoguan, and the northern section has been opened from Wuchang Xujiapeng to Zhuzhou in Hunan. However, the section between Zhuzhou and Shaoguan has not yet been completed. Last year, the Ministry of Railways borrowed the Boxer Indemnity to issue public bonds and established the Yuehan Railway Zhushao Section Engineering Bureau, appointing Ling Hongxun as the director, to actively construct the railway. Currently, the project is underway. Suddenly, there was news that the project would be suspended due to the fact that the British Boxer Indemnity had not yet been borrowed. The Hunan Provincial Party Department, believing that this section of the project is extremely important to the culture and transportation of Hunan Province, sent a letter to Director Ling to inquire. Yesterday, Director Ling replied, stating that the project would be completed in four years and that there would be no suspension of work. The two letters are recorded below to show the latest progress of the railway.</p>
<p>The letter from the Hunan Provincial Party Department stated: "We are writing to you because it is rumored that the Yuehan Railway Zhushao section project may be suspended because the issuance of public bonds using the British Boxer Indemnity has not been completed. We are very surprised. The Yuehan Railway is the only north-south trunk line in our country and is of great importance. It should be completed as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. We do not know whether the aforementioned rumors are true. If the rumors are not true and are not affected by other factors, and the project can continue to progress, then at the latest, in what year and month can the railway be completed and open to traffic? Your bureau should be able to understand this. We respectfully request that you provide us with a detailed and accurate reply regarding the actual situation and the current progress of the project to dispel our doubts."</p>
<p>The reply from the Yuehan Railway Zhushao Section Engineering Bureau stated: "The project plan of this bureau is in accordance with the agreement between the Ministry of Railways and the Board of Directors for the Management of the Central Boxer Indemnity to borrow the Boxer Indemnity, which stipulates that the project will be completed in four years. This bureau has already formulated a four-year construction schedule, which is calculated from the time the British Boxer Indemnity is determined in July of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to June of the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the tracks can be connected and open to traffic. The funds required for this plan, including labor and materials, are stipulated to be used half for purchasing materials in the United Kingdom and half for domestic construction and expenses. The domestic half is further divided into two items. The first item is the funds that will be due within four years, from the 22nd to the 25th year of the Republic of China, which will be allocated and used on schedule. The second item is the funds that will be due from the 26th to the 35th year of the Republic of China. Because they are after the construction period, it has been agreed that the Ministry of Railways will use them as a fund to issue public bonds during the four-year construction period to meet the needs of the project. This bureau moved its office to Hunan in September last year and simultaneously expanded construction towards each other from both ends of Shaozhou and Zhuzhou, proceeding completely according to the four-year plan. All domestic funds for labor and materials, since the Boxer Indemnity began to be allocated last year, have been remitted by the Ministry of Railways without any shortage. Recently, the Ministry has proposed to change the public bonds, which were originally planned to be issued in four years, to a one-time issuance. Moreover, because this railway is extremely important, the Ministry has strictly ordered this bureau to step up its work and complete the project ahead of schedule. After this bureau has rearranged the construction schedule, if everything goes smoothly and is not affected by other factors, it is estimated that the tracks can be connected and open to traffic in December of the 25th year of the Republic of China. As for the completion of repairs and minor projects, it will take several more months. This is half a year shorter than the originally scheduled time. However, domestic funds have been affected by the recent decline in the price of pounds. Therefore, this bureau is trying to reduce all expenses, only seeking to obtain a solid and rapid railway. Other aspects of housing and equipment will be simplified for the time being, pending future supplementation after being handed over to the management bureau for operation. This bureau is now carefully planning all projects. In addition to the section from Leichang to Pingshi, which is being rushed to complete in order to connect with the provincial highway as soon as possible, the projects of the seventh general section in Lukou and the sixth general section in Hengzhou will be tendered separately next month, and all will begin construction in March and April. Therefore, the rumor of suspension of work is indeed a misunderstanding. We are enclosing the four-year construction schedule of this bureau for your review to dispel your doubts." (February 1st)</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>A Fire Outside the West Gate Kills Two People</p>
<p>Outside the West Gate of this county is a place where boatmen gather and the market is quite developed. There is a Cai family charitable hall with spacious houses, numbering more than a hundred. The frontage is rented out to others for opening shops. At around 11 pm on the 2nd of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the Qianshunchang paper and horse sundry goods shop at number five. It took half an hour for the neighbors to hear the sound and report the fire. After a while, it spread to the Yu Gengtang vegetable shop and the Cai Hesi tailor shop on the right. Qian Songsong, the owner of the Qianshunchang shop, usually lived in the shop. On this day, Qian happened to have returned home in the city, and the shop was guarded by his mother-in-law, Qian Si Guanniang, and his son, Yun Sheng (12 years old). They were sleeping in the loft. When the fire started, the two of them could not escape and were buried in the flames. It is said that the old woman was over sixty years old. Qian Songsong was her son-in-law, and the family still had savings. This time, because they heard that kerosene was going to rise in price, they specially purchased dozens of boxes in bulk to wait for the price to rise, which led to the fire being unstoppable. According to statistics, the loss is nearly ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Another Thief Captured in the Donglai Town Robbery Case</p>
<p>Donglai Town in this county was robbed by bandits on November 27th, resulting in a loss of tens of thousands of yuan. After the incident, the authorities conducted a strict investigation, and arrests were made in Liuhe and other places. The captured suspects were detained in the Bayou County prison. On the 2nd of this month, the second police force stationed in Langshan arrested another suspect, surnamed Shen, in Langshan. Shen, who ran a dim sum stall, was escorted back to the county. On the night of the 2nd, the county police interrogated him, but Shen refused to confess, claiming to be innocent. As a result, the police summoned the victims and, after interrogating the various suspects, will proceed further.</p>

<h3>The Electricity Company Reorganizes Its Disputes</h3>
<p>The electricity emitted by the electric light company is dim, and users have complained a lot. The county government and the county chamber of commerce urged the company to change its direction. Huang Mengban, the manager and chairman of the board, convened a board of directors meeting at the Bufang Hotel in Shanghai. Huang proposed a loan to improve the situation, but it was not passed. Then it was decided to reinstate the former manager, Xu Xizhi, to effectively reorganize the company and maintain public utility. On the 1st of this month, Xu went to the company to take over, but Manager Gong raised an objection to the board of directors meeting. Xu Xizhi and five other directors and supervisors who attended the meeting published newspaper articles to refute him. As a result, the takeover could not proceed. The county government also reported the dispute between the two parties to the Provincial Department of Construction for resolution. Manager Gong also filed a lawsuit with the prosecutor's office, and the trial is scheduled for the 7th. Both parties have notified users to temporarily postpone payment of electricity bills and wait for a solution. The issue of the company's manager is becoming more complicated, and it is not known when the improvement plan will be implemented. It is reported that five directors and supervisors, including Zhang Shouzhi, convened a temporary board of directors meeting to resolve everything, which is scheduled to be held in Songjiang on the 5th.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Panic After the Price Increase of Solar Oil</p>
<p>Solar oil and diesel oil are necessary for the power of machinery and have always been imported from overseas. The Ministry of Finance uniformly increased tariffs on February 1st, and the General Tax Department has already implemented this. The shipping industry, water pumping industry, rice milling industry, and other industries using machinery in Wuxi were greatly alarmed by this news. They gathered to discuss the matter and unanimously believed that the usual selling price of solar oil was only over 70 yuan per ton, but now it has suddenly increased by 50 yuan, almost doubling. The amount needed in Wuxi alone is about 160 tons per month, and the annual total is about 2,000 tons. At a time when the market is depressed and business is very slow, the increase of 100,000 yuan in user costs will have a huge impact, both directly and indirectly. Yesterday, they specially gathered the chamber of commerce to request relief. The chamber of commerce stated that the increase in tax rates must be first reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan in accordance with legislative procedures before it can be implemented, in order to show that the people's livelihood is being considered and to demonstrate caution. It has already telegraphed the administrative and legislative branches in Nanjing to request the Ministry of Finance to withdraw its order and has also telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shipping Industry Association to advocate for a unified position.</p>
<h3>The Xiyi Road Will Open to Traffic Next Month</h3>
<p>After the roadbed and pavement of the Xiyi Road were completed, the Jiangnan Automobile Company contracted the exclusive right to operate the road and is scheduled to open it to traffic on the 1st of next month. Currently, the company has surveyed the open space along the road on the east side of the train station in this county as a bus station and immediately hired workers to raise the foundation and build houses. The company also considers Tonghui Road and Wuqiao in this county to be essential roads. However, Wuqiao has been in disrepair for many years and cannot withstand heavy loads. Therefore, it plans to rebuild the steel-reinforced concrete bridge and has already hired six workers yesterday to replace the rotten planks on the bridge surface to repair it.</p>
<p>In the Yu family's house at No. 82 Gandeli, Dongxin Road, outside Guangfu Gate, at around 4 pm yesterday, a fire broke out when coal cinders from the stove were thrown out and ignited the mosquito net, causing the flames to spread instantly and becoming inaccessible. Fearing that they would be affected, nearby residents rushed to carry their belongings outside. At that time, there was a lot of noise and chaos. However, two women, Shi Sun and Chen Xu, from No. 52 took the opportunity to steal a leather suitcase and a silk cotton robe belonging to Lu Yaokui from No. 92. After Lu found out, he twisted the two women together and brought them to the Second Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to No. 52 to recover the stolen goods. The two women, Shi and Chen, were taken to the county for prosecution. In addition, Gu Shaolun, a villager from Yangxiangshang, Hadianqiao, Second District, had an affair with Zhang, the wife of his neighbor, He Jinchuan. The night before, Gu went to He's house again for a secret meeting. At midnight, they cooked snacks to satisfy their hunger, but a spark fell into the firewood stack, causing a fire that spread to neighboring houses, burning down more than 30 houses in total. After He Jinchuan returned home, he was furious upon hearing the news and stripped his wife naked and tied her to a tree for several hours to punish her.</p>

<h3>Dredging Plan for the Zhenjiang Jiangtan (River Beach)</h3>
<p>The Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Bureau, noting a decline in freight volume at Zhenjiang in recent years, attributes the cause to the impact of the Huojiaqiao shipping operations. The success of Huojiaqiao shipping is due to the convenience and reduced costs of loading and unloading at its docks. Previously, the bureau sent personnel to investigate and confirm these facts. In addition to revising freight handling methods to favor merchants and recover railway freight, they also recognized the close relationship between the silting of Zhenjiang's Jiangtan and transportation. Last September, Chief of General Affairs Mo Heng came to Zhenjiang to discuss with Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce representatives Lu Xiaobo and Hu Jianchun, assisting in the Jiangtan Dredging Association to complete the dredging project. However, due to the enormous costs involved, immediate fundraising was impossible, so they proposed it to the Ministry of Railways. Yesterday, the Ministry of Railways dispatched Assistant Director of Business Affairs Tan Yaozong, Technician Zhou Liangqin, and Specialist Liu Chijing, along with Chen Zuoming, the Freight Inspector stationed at the Bureau's Transportation Department, to Zhenjiang. Accompanied by Zhenjiang Stationmaster Zeng Dianhong, they surveyed the area along the river. They also invited Hu Jianchun to a discussion at the Dahua Hotel, exchanging opinions. The resulting plan involves dredging the Jiangtan in two phases. The section from Pingzheng Bridge to Zhenjiang Customs House will be undertaken by the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau also plans to purchase private land in front of the small station to construct a ship dock, aiming for business expansion. The above plan will be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and then put out for tender in Shanghai, with the intention of dredging by manual labor.</p>

<h3>County Party Department Establishes Farmers' Loan Office</h3>
<p>To support the rural economy, the County Party Department has sought funding to establish a Farmers' Loan Office to provide loans to farmers. The loan methods are divided into two types: credit and mortgage. Real estate deeds are used as collateral or guarantees. The loan amount per household is generally limited to 50 to 100 yuan. The funds can only be used for productive purposes. The monthly interest rate is calculated at 1%. Annual loans and repayments are divided into two seasons: loans are issued in January and repaid in May for the upper season, and loans are issued in June and repaid in October for the lower season. Borrowers may repay part or all of the loan at any time, and the interest is calculated based on the actual number of days of the outstanding balance. A director will be appointed, serving concurrently as the head of the Rural Economy Section of the County Party Department's Social Enterprise Committee.</p>

<p>Kong Xiangxi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<h3>President Chiang Kai-shek's Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, having been invited by President Chiang Kai-shek, flew to Hangzhou. The matter has now been completed, and he flew from Hangzhou to Shanghai at 3 PM yesterday. Song Ziwen's disciple Di Ziliang and three of Kong's sons accompanied him. At 3:50 PM, the Ford plane landed at Hongqiao Airport. Having received a telegram in advance, Kong's wife and daughters went to the airport to meet him. After landing, they took three cars back to their residence on Avenue Petain.

<p>Special District National Products Exhibition Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>Excellent Results in the National Products Movement</p>
<p>Temporary Market Also Closed Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District National Products Movement Conference, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, has been running for over a month since its opening. The association is located on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, surrounded by upper-middle-class residential areas and with convenient transportation, so it has attracted massive crowds of visitors every day. Since the establishment of the concessions, this conference has been the most successful national products movement to date. The conference was originally scheduled to open on November 15th of last year, but delays postponed the opening until December 30th. The exhibition lasted for two months. Now, with the approaching Lunar New Year, participating factories have requested early closure due to the customary holidays of their employees. The association convened a meeting the day before yesterday and unanimously agreed to hold a closing ceremony at 6 PM yesterday (the 4th), with the temporary market also closing simultaneously. The ceremony was grand. The total business statistics, guest list, and closing ceremony of the conference are excerpted below.</p>
<p>Guest List</p>
<p>Around 5 PM yesterday, the association's auditorium was newly decorated, and guests arrived in a continuous stream. Representatives from various legal entities and factories included Hu Fengxiang and Zhang Yichen from the Citizens' Union, Chen Shude, Zheng Dongshan, Liang Gengshun, Zhao Ziyun, Zhu Zhichun, Fang Peicheng, Ge Futian, Zhang Xianfang, Qiu Jialiang, Zhou Fuzhang, and others from various district branches, Tao Leqin representing the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, Xu Letian from the National Debt Fund Management Committee, Chen Binghui from the Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, and Cao Zhigong, Zheng Peifeng, Jin Weixuan, Qu Xiyong, Sun Xinzu, and other factory representatives, totaling over 800 people.</p>
<p>Conference Staff</p>
<p>Presidium members Liu Zhongying, Xu Yunhui, Hu Fengxiang, Chen Binghui, Zhang Yichen; Secretary Zhou Zhaolin; Master of Ceremonies Chen Jiufeng; Receptionists Fan Tianjin, Ping Buqing, Lei Jiajun, Qiu Pingshan, Cai Mingzheng, Wang Jian; Discipline Officers Liu Chunfan, Gao Liancheng, Zhang Guangyao, Jiang Genlin, Qian Ziping, Wu Jue; and over 30 Boy Scouts from Renci School, led by Principal Zhu Zhichun, maintained order.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>(1) Gun salute, (2) Music, (3) Presidium takes seats, (4) All stand at attention, (5) Pay the highest respect to the Party-State flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (6) Chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will (Zhang Yichen), (7) Moment of silence, (8) Chairman reports on the purpose of the conference (Chen Binghui), (9) Chairman delivers closing remarks (Liu Zhongying), (10) Guest speeches, (11) Sing the Women's National Products Year Song, (12) Photograph, (13) Closing (Chen Binghui), (14) Lower the flag (Hu Fengxiang), (15) Ceremony completed, (16) Declaration issued (text omitted).</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Liu Zhongying and Xu Yunhui, standing committee members of the association, gave speeches, stating that the association, recognizing the increasing foreign aggression and national crisis, believes that the root cause lies in the Chinese people's fondness for foreign goods. Looking at the import and export statistics of previous years, the outflow of money is enormous, leading to the current economic and military aggression. Therefore, to fundamentally solve the problem, on the one hand, we must encourage factories to increase production and improve products, and on the other hand, we must awaken the public to promote and purchase national products as much as possible, so that production and sales are equal. If this is the case, then factories will not have to worry about shutdowns and bankruptcies, finance will benefit from turnover and circulation, the national economy will be strengthened, and foreign aggression will be curbed. The Shanghai concessions are a major base for the dumping of foreign goods. Therefore, the association has bravely held this event despite the difficulties, so that the people of the special district have the opportunity to recognize national products, thereby arousing good ideas about loving and using national products. All the people present today are patriots. Please do your best to promote national products so that the entire nation will use them.</p>
<p>Business Statistics</p>
<p>The temporary market attached to the association opened on December 30th of last year and closed yesterday, totaling 37 days. According to the association's statistics department, the total business volume for the first week was 160,892.14 yuan, the second week 123,610.04 yuan, the third week 110,064.14 yuan, and the fourth week 98,734.09 yuan. The number of visitors was estimated to be over 800,000.</p>
<p>Rushing to Finish</p>
<p>The association closed yesterday, and the responsible personnel of each department rushed to finish up. In addition to moving the office back to 160 Baek Road to continue operations, the accounting department, together with the general affairs department, worked overnight to rush out the income and expenditure report. It is heard that the internal income and expenditure accounts of the association will be announced within the next few days.</p>
<p>Flour Industry Requests Tax Exemption</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Rejects the Request</h3>
<p>Low Taxes on Raw Materials, High Taxes on Finished Products</p>
<p>Already Facilitating the Sale of Chinese Flour</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flour Millers' Association previously requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt imported foreign wheat from taxes before the promulgation of the new tax rates. It is now learned that the association has received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, which is inconvenient to approve in order to set a precedent. The original reply stated: "The implementation of new tax regulations in recent years has not stipulated a grace period. Customs tariffs apply to goods from all countries, and if a grace period is set, the treatment will be unfair due to the different distances of incoming goods. This time, the import tax on rice, wheat, and flour has not been stipulated a grace period, and it has been announced in advance. For example, 0.030 gold units per dan, while the import tax on flour is 0.15 gold units per dan, which is a large difference. This has the benefit of low taxes on raw materials and high taxes on finished products, which facilitates the sale of Chinese flour. Moreover, it is a common occurrence for imported goods to be ordered before the promulgation of tax regulations. Previous implementations of new tax regulations have always taxed according to the tax regulations, and it is really inconvenient to set this precedent, approving the merchants' foreign wheat ordered before the promulgation of the wheat tax, which would disrupt the customs regulations."</p>
<p>Factory Inspection in the Concessions to Continue Discussions</p>
<p>The Factory Federation Suggests Implementation Methods to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Going to Nanyang to Investigate Industry and Commerce to Serve as a Model for Improvement</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the factory inspection in the Shanghai concessions was suspended because the concession authorities did not approve it. It is now heard that the Ministry of Industry is determined to continue discussions with the concession authorities to achieve implementation. The Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Federation has specifically formulated methods and suggested that the municipal government adopt them. The municipal government is still considering them. The federation also plans to jointly organize national product manufacturers to go to Nanyang in March-May of this year to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the industrial and commercial situation in the region, as well as the safety equipment of factories, in order to serve as a model for improving industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Municipal Federation District Branches Issue Rent Reduction Notices Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, after the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union launched the rent reduction movement, various groups and merchants responded enthusiastically. Yesterday, the Citizens' Union's directly-administered District 18, 32, and 35 branches also responded to the requests of citizens in their respective districts, and according to the resolutions of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, simultaneously notified citizens in their respective districts to register with the union to facilitate collection of statistics and promote the movement. The notice is excerpted as follows: "Notice: Since the Shanghai War of the past year, the market has been declining daily, and commerce has become increasingly depressed, leading to factory closures and shop closures, which are everywhere. The lives of ordinary citizens have suddenly become impoverished. This has a significant impact on social stability. Although the prices of daily necessities, clothing, food, and goods have gradually become cheaper recently, the rent for housing, which is the most deadly blow to citizens, remains as expensive as before. Moreover, landlords, driven by greed and holding the exclusive power of capital, are still proposing rent increases. In this era of economic panic, who can bear this? In view of this, the union is based on the duty to relieve the suffering of citizens and aims to reduce the burden on citizens. According to the regulations of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee: (1) Houses built in the Republic of China (year blank) should pay rent at 90% of the original rate; (2) Houses built from the Republic of China years 14 to 16 should pay rent at 80% of the original rate; (3) Houses built from the Republic of China years 17 to 19 should pay rent at 70% of the original rate; (4) Houses built from the Republic of China years 20 to 22 should pay rent at 60% of the original rate. The current rent paid is the standard. If the rent has already been increased, it will be calculated based on the date of construction. Respond to the rent reduction movement and, as resolved by the first executive committee meeting of the union, organize a Rent Committee to notify the citizens in the district to register with the union to make effective preparations and achieve the practical effect of rent reduction. You are welcome to express your opinions so that they can be included in the agenda for consideration and adoption. Once the registration is completed, a general meeting of members' representatives and an expanded meeting will be convened. This matter concerns your vital interests. All citizens in the district are urged to unite and strive together to achieve the final goal. We sincerely hope you will attach a rent survey form and fill it out according to the format and send it to the union within three days for collection and statistics and to facilitate the movement. Please do not delay. This is the notice."</p>

<p>Jinghu Railway Freight Train Derails at Benniu Station Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Four Freight Cars Overturn, Tracks and Sleepers Damaged</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Dispatches Two Rescue Trains to Provide Assistance</p>
<p>Repaired by 7 PM, All Trains Able to Pass Directly</p>
<p>At around 9 AM yesterday, the 321st down freight train on the Jinghu Railway derailed at the west switch track of Benniu Station due to a broken axle, causing four freight cars to derail and fall. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Axle Breaks</p>
<p>The 321st down freight train on the line, with over 30 cars, was traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai the night before. When it passed the west switch track of Benniu Station at the 185-kilometer mark at 9:05 AM yesterday morning, the axle of a freight car near the locomotive suddenly broke, causing the car body to fall onto the tracks and drag for hundreds of steps. The steel rails and sleepers were severely damaged. Fortunately, it was a freight car, so no one was injured, and the locomotive was not damaged.</p>
<p>Four Cars Derail</p>
<p>The stationmaster of the station was notified and immediately rushed to inspect. It was found that four freight cars, numbers 1564 (40-ton car), 6245, 6266, 30, and Jinpu Railway car number 45243, had derailed and were lying across the tracks, completely blocking both the main and branch lines. He immediately telegraphed for assistance.</p>
<h3>Unable to Use Crane</h3>
<p>Lu Xueji, the resident engineer of the railway, received the news and immediately went to inspect, accompanied by Su Dan, the section chief of the Transportation Department, and Director Lu, along with a large number of workers. They took a rescue train. They determined that the tracks and sleepers were severely damaged, and the derailed cars were even more severely damaged, making it impossible to lift them with a crane. They immediately telegraphed Shanghai to request a large crane to be used and supervised the workers to first clear the main line to facilitate traffic. It was not until 7 PM that the main line was temporarily repaired, but trains still had to reduce speed when passing.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bureau Sends Rescue</h3>
<p>Upon receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Bureau immediately dispatched a large crane from the Wusong Machinery Factory. Pu Dengqing, the deputy director of the engineering department, Westin Whitewell, the acting director, and Feng Qili, the chief engineer, accompanied the train and departed from Shanghai North Station at 1:50 PM to direct the repair work. Yuan Shaochang, the deputy director of the Transportation Department, was assigned by the Transportation Department to be responsible for investigating the cause of the accident. Tang Huannan, the resident section chief, was responsible for maintaining traffic management and also accompanied the train to Benniu.</p>
<p>Repaired at Dusk</p>
<p>After the accident, because both the main and branch lines were blocked by the derailed cars, trains in both directions could not pass completely. In order to maintain traffic, a temporary transition measure was implemented. Trains heading up to Benniu were redirected to drive back to Shanghai as down trains, and trains heading down to Benniu were redirected to drive back to Nanjing as up trains. Passengers had to get off the train at the station and walk past the accident site before boarding the train on the opposite side to travel to their destination. It was not until after 7 PM that all trains were able to pass directly. Therefore, all trains coming from Nanjing yesterday were delayed by several hours.</p>

<p>[City Chamber of Commerce Re-Submits to the Municipal Government]</p>
<h3>Dredging of the Suzhou Creek Traffic</h3>
<p>Relocating Beggar Boats and Idle Vessels</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, due to the Suzhou Creek's low water level in winter, causing congestion and difficulty for vessels to pass through, specially submitted a request to the Municipal Government yesterday, asking them to find a way to dredge and facilitate traffic, etc. The original request is recorded as follows: The submission is for requesting matters. On January 31st, this association, based on the Shanghai Rice Milling Industry, Grain, Oil Cake Industry, Bean Products Industry and other six trade associations, as well as Fuxin No. 1 Flour Mill, Jiangsu Bank Warehouse, the Shanghai Warehouse of the Four Banks Savings Society, the Bank of Communications Warehouse, and Yu Kang Warehouse, etc., eighteen companies jointly submitted a letter stating that the Suzhou Creek's water level is low in winter, and vessels are crowded, blocking traffic. Please send a letter to the Dredging Bureau, requesting the Chief Engineer of the Bureau to dredge as soon as possible. The Chief Engineer's letter stated that since the dredging method for the Suzhou Creek was agreed upon with the Municipal Government at the beginning of the 20th year, it has been actively carried out without interruption. Since the start of the work, more than 220,000 cubic feet of silt have been removed. The section from the Waibaidu Bridge to Yichang Road has been deepened and widened. Yuji Mound and St. John's University have also been specially widened. As for the main reason for the recent blockage of the channel, it is due to the increase in traffic and the habitual low tide in winter. If further widening is desired, strong embankments must be built near the construction site to ensure safety, and beggar boats and other idle vessels should also be relocated completely. However, these are all matters for the municipal authorities. The Bureau is currently doing its best to ensure the progress of the dredging project. Approved by the association, in addition to sending separate letters for notification, it is appropriate to prepare a document to present for your approval. Please grant consideration and handling to facilitate Suzhou Creek traffic, which is a public convenience.</p>

<p>After the Ningbo Relief Society was dissolved</p>
<h3>Great Public Outrage Among Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing and others telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to investigate thoroughly</p>
<p>Since the Ningxian Relief Society was forcibly dissolved by the county party headquarters, local groups and Ningbo fellow villagers in Shanghai, such as Yu Qiaqing, and other gentlemen, were greatly outraged and telegraphed the provincial government and provincial party headquarters for assistance. The telegrams are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>To Chairman Chiang in Hangzhou, the Ningbo Ningxian Relief Society was ordered to be dissolved by the Ningxian County Party Headquarters, arousing public anger. It is found that the society is a purely charitable organization, and the poor have benefited greatly from the distribution of clothing and rice over the years, which has been praised by the villagers for more than a day. The inside story of the dissolution by the county party headquarters this time is that before the Qing Communist movement, the Ningbo branch of the Chinese Relief Society was illegally dissolved by Wang Kun and Yang Meishan, who had been executed, and its assets were seized. Later, Mr. Wang Yiting requested the provincial government to approve the return, but it was still controlled by the Ningxian County Party Headquarters. The Ningxian Relief Society was originally reorganized from the Ningbo branch of the Chinese Relief Society after it was dissolved. At that time, the county went to receive the assets when they had been ordered to be returned by the provincial government, and the Ningxian County Party Headquarters immediately accused them of occupying them and used this as a reason to dissolve the society. Moreover, they even said that it only distributed clothing and rice and did not donate to the Yellow River flood, failing to fulfill its charitable duties, which was also a crime for dissolution. Such fabrication will make the kind-hearted feel cold and the poor lose help, which is not a blessing for the country and society. For this reason, we telegraph to Your Excellency, urging the Provincial Party Headquarters to correct this immediately and severely punish the personnel in charge of the Ningxian County Party Headquarters who abused their power, in order to maintain discipline and peace for the people. The Party and the country are fortunate, and the villagers are fortunate. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jin Tingsun, Zhang Shenzhi, Zhang Jiguang, Wei Bozhen, Sun Meitang, Yu Zuoting, Wu Zhihao, Zhu Meixian, respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>To Lu, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Lu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, in Hangzhou, the Ningxian Relief Society was reorganized from the former Ningbo branch of the Chinese Relief Society and was established in accordance with the law with complete procedures. It specializes in various charitable undertakings, such as distributing clothing and rice and running charity schools. The poor have benefited, and the villagers praise it. Unexpectedly, the Ningxian County Party Headquarters, in order to achieve its purpose of seizing property, did not hesitate to issue an order to dissolve the society based on completely false reasons. It is found that the former Ningbo branch of the Chinese Relief Society owned three properties, which were illegally confiscated by the Communist bandits Wu Kun and Yang Meishan when they were in charge of party affairs in the 16th year of the Republic. After the purification of the party began and Wang and Yang were executed, Mr. Wang Yiting of the Shanghai Relief Society presented a request to Your Excellency, who repeatedly ordered the municipal and county governments to return the properties. However, the county party headquarters came out to obstruct this, and the matter was not resolved. Later, the Jiangdong meeting place was allocated by the party headquarters to the Minqiang School, the meeting place in the city was also allocated by the party headquarters as the site of the private hospital of party member Ying Xifan, and the Jiangbei meeting place was allocated by the county government as the Yuxiu School, with cuckoos occupying the magpie's nest, making the return hopeless. On April 6th of last year, the Ningxian County Government, in response to Your Excellency's order to return the properties, ordered the schools to move out by a certain date. Except for Yuxiu, which complied with the order, Minqiang and party member Ying refused to comply. In July of last year, Minqiang was ordered to close down, and the former branch was ordered to take over. The county party headquarters, claiming to have kept the properties in dual custody for a long time, accused the association of forcibly occupying them, sent personnel to lead police to drive out the staff and seal the clothing and rice. At the same time, at the ninth congress of representatives, it proposed to dissolve the congress without investigation and hastily passed the motion. After receiving the order, the association, feeling unwilling due to the reversal of right and wrong, listed the facts and submitted them to the Provincial Party Headquarters for legal correction. Various groups in Shanghai and Ningbo were filled with righteous indignation and telegraphed in support of justice. Recently, the county party headquarters, knowing that its measures were inappropriate and had aroused public anger, fabricated charges, exaggerated its words, and accused the person in charge of the association of slandering the party headquarters and submitted it to the province for review. Such destruction of good deeds and deprivation of civil rights, without self-reflection, dared to fabricate words and frame people, causing the kind-hearted to feel cold and the poor to lose help, destroying the laws of the country and party discipline to no end. In addition to the association submitting a request to Your Excellency for appeal, He De and others, who are familiar with the situation, cannot bear to see violence rampant and their hometown suffer. They dare to telegraph to Your Excellency, asking you to have mercy on the people's suffering and preside over justice with the utmost urgency. Yu Hede, Yuan Lidun, Wu Zhihao, Zhu Meixian, respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Two Disaster Relief Telegrams</p>
<h3>Request for Funds for Emergency Relief in Sui Province</h3>
<p>The Suiyuan Provincial Government recently reported that the province was hit by a Yellow River flood and that various charitable groups and the Yellow River Flood Emergency Relief Association had agreed to allocate funds for relief. They sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, requesting that the funds be remitted to the Suiyuan Relief Association for emergency relief.

<p>Rescuing the Domestic Sugar Industry</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry is drafting a revitalization plan</p>
<p>Capital is set at two million yuan</p>
<p>The amount of sugar produced in our country's Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces is sufficient to supply the whole country, but in recent years, foreign sugar has poured in and been dumped at low prices, which has greatly affected domestic sugar and caused business to plummet. It is now learned that the Ministry of Industry is drafting a revitalization plan to revive the domestic sugar industry, with a capital of two million yuan. The steps to be taken are: (1) First, make the National Sugar Manufacturing Company resume production; (2) Reorganize the Puyi Sugar Factory; (3) Establish sugar factories in Qiongyai, Chaozhang, and Chuanjiang, etc.</p>
<p>Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce Letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Please forward to various factories to promote domestic goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, stating: Recently, our association member Gu Suming claimed that the north corner of Jiaxing City is a commercial center. Since the demolition of the city walls and the reconstruction of the roads, the prosperity of the market has become more developed, and the convenience of transportation has been connected by ships. Foreign houses are towering on the banks of the Sujia Road, and sails are like clouds under the Beili Bridge, resembling a ten-mile foreign concession, and even like a giant trading port. Members serve the community and have the responsibility of revitalizing the market. Promoting domestic goods is even more urgent. Therefore, they have raised funds to purchase land and build a four-story European-style building with a grand scale and perfect decoration to establish a domestic goods market, which is very appropriate. Now that the house is about to be completed, we intend to consult the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and forward it to various domestic goods factories, hoping that they will be willing to come and promote domestic goods as a permanent place, which not only depends on the future of commerce in our Jiaxing, but also relates to the national economy and people's livelihood. We have also attached two pages of drawings. In this regard, our association believes that it concerns the revitalization of the commercial market and the promotion of domestic goods, so we should agree to the request and forward it to your association. We ask you to investigate and handle it. It is now learned that the association believes that it concerns the promotion of domestic goods, so it should be approved and forwarded. It has been sent to the Shanghai National Goods Factory and other five groups for investigation.</p>

<p>Coconut Oil Tax Awaiting Tariff Conference Reply</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Soap Industry Association stating that the import tax on coconut oil used in soap making is too heavy, which hinders the development of the soap industry.

<p>The Social Bureau Cares for the Poor in the Shelters</p>

<p>The Bar Association Asks the Legislative Yuan to Enact Children's Laws</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association submitted a document to the Legislative Yuan yesterday, stating that in order to enact laws to protect children and cultivate the foundation of the country, the elements of a country are the people, the land, and sovereignty. The strength of the people is closely related to the rise and fall of the country, and the strength of the people is directly proportional to the strength of children. Therefore, a sound country requires sound children, and their development requires the protection of the country, such as (1) preventing children's crimes, (2) paying attention to the education of abnormal children, (3) studying the problem of helping poor children, (4) correcting children's physical and mental conditions, and (5) organizing children's courts and protecting released children, etc., are all matters that the country should pay attention to. Various countries in the East and West have already taken measures in this regard. For example, Japan has a children's protection department attached to the Social Affairs Bureau, the United Kingdom has enacted children's laws, and the states of Illinois and New York in the United States, as well as South Australia and Canada, have established children's courts. Their welfare measures for children are comprehensive and thorough. Our country did not pay attention to this before. Even after the National Government unified the North and South, although civil and criminal laws were promulgated one after another, the laws concerning children, which are related to the rise and fall of the country, are still lacking. The provisions of Articles 30-1 and 2 of the current Criminal Law are only part of the laws protecting children and not a complete solution. However, there is no suitable correctional education institution to implement them, so the provisions are equivalent to being set up in vain. Because children receive less protection from the country, the number of children with poor qualities increases, forming the organizational cells of the country. If they are not completely healthy, the country's future will be greatly affected. The 158th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Association resolved that it should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for the enactment of laws to protect children and cultivate the foundation of the country. We hereby submit this request to Your Excellency for review, adoption, and implementation, which would be a great benefit.</p>

<p>Money Swapped for Money</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Over Ten Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>Manager Denies Involvement</p>
<p>Accountant Missing</p>
<p>Various businesses in the city, when they need silver funds before 9:00 AM on weekdays, often notify an acquaintance at a money exchange (even those they do not usually do business with) to have the required amount of silver funds (paper money) delivered by staff for immediate use, since the city's banks are not yet open. After 9:00 AM, they then send their staff to the bank to withdraw the funds they have deposited and return the full amount to the money exchange from which they borrowed. The money exchanges then take a small rebate of interest. This method of swapping paper money for paper money is a common practice in the city's business world. He Feng Grain Store, located at No. 17 Doudou City Street outside Dadongmen in the Southern District, usually does not do business with Hong Tai Money Exchange on Broadway in the Public Concession. However, sometimes when they need paper money for use early in the morning, they notify the exchange to use the aforementioned method of swapping paper money for paper money. On the evening of the 2nd of this month, Hong Tai Money Exchange received a telegram from Wang Lianfang (55 years old, from Tianjin), the manager of He Feng Store, stating that the store needed $11,000 of paper money before 9:00 AM the next day (the 3rd). They requested permission to send staff with the funds at 8:00 AM without fail. The next morning, around 8:00 AM, Hong Tai Money Exchange immediately approved and dispatched two staff members, He Yuben and He Erhuang, both from Zhenjiang, with $9,000 of paper money from the China Industrial Bank and $2,000 of paper money from the Central Bank, totaling $11,000, to He Feng Store. They handed the paper money over to Manager Wang, who accepted it. They saw Wang immediately hand the paper money over to Qian Jiehou (26 years old, from Zhenjiang), the assistant accountant of the store, to count the amount. After checking the numbers, Qian Jiehou locked it in the silver safe and instructed the two staff members to wait. After 9:00 AM, the store would send staff to withdraw $11,000 of deposited funds from the bank where they usually did business and have the two staff members take it back to the money exchange to return it. At the time, He and the other staff member were waiting to be paid back, so they sat in the store to wait for the repayment. Unexpectedly, even until 10:00 PM that evening, the store had not handed over the repayment. At the time, the accountant Qian Jiehou also suddenly disappeared. In a state of panic, they urged Manager Wang to inquire. Wang not only did not hand over the $11,000 of paper money that should have been returned but also suddenly denied borrowing the money. At this point, He and the other staff member realized that they had been deceived. They then twisted Wang over to the police at that station and took him to the relevant First District General Office. Yesterday, during the preliminary hearing led by District Chief Guan, He Yuben and He Erhuang filed a complaint about the circumstances of the above-mentioned fraud, requesting a thorough investigation. When questioned, Wang Lianfang completely denied colluding to defraud the money exchange of $11,000 and stated that the accountant Qian Jiehou had indeed fled without a trace. As for why he fled or whether he had planned to defraud the money, he really did not know. Due to the matter involving the use of the money-swapping method to defraud a large sum of money, an order was issued yesterday at around 6:00 PM to send Manager Wang Lianfang of He Feng Store to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Female Student Attempts Suicide at Huizhong Hostel</p>
<h3>Escapes Danger After Emergency Treatment</h3>
<p>On the 1st of this month, a woman resembling a female student checked into the New Huizhong Hostel, located at the intersection of Hankou Road and Hubei Road in the Public Concession. At that time, the hostel's front desk clerk assigned her Room 251 on the second floor. The woman, who identified herself as Zhou Bingqing, from Songjiang, 37 years old, and involved in education, had been staying indoors and keeping to herself for several days without any special actions. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the hostel's tea server noticed that she had not yet gotten up, which seemed different from usual. He went to knock on her door to wake her up, but she did not respond for a long time. The tea server became suspicious and opened the door to find the woman lying on the bed, her face pale and her breathing shallow. There was a letter addressed to a certain female student at Wu Ben Girls' Middle School on Huangjia Que Road in Ximen left on the table, covered in cigarette ash. When questioned, she did not say anything. Recognizing that she had ingested poison, the tea server urgently notified the front desk, who then reported it to the Laozha Police Station. A vehicle was dispatched to rush her to Renji Hospital for treatment. After emergency treatment by the hospital's doctors, her condition gradually improved. By 5:00 PM, she was completely out of danger and fully conscious. At the same time, the woman voluntarily requested to be discharged from the hospital. After the doctor's permission, she left the hospital on her own.</p>
<p>City Detective Squad Informant Little Golden Treasure Assassinated</p>
<p>Four Bandits Suddenly Arrive in the Early Morning</p>
<p>Shot with Box Guns</p>
<p>Little Golden Treasure, a native of Suzhou, 30 years old, lived alone in a straw hut behind the Public Welfare Glass Factory on Huiwen Road in Zhabei. He had no family. He used to make a living by theft, but soon abandoned his old life due to the strict pursuit of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He reformed and became an informant for theft cases in the detective squad. Unexpectedly, this aroused the jealousy of his former accomplices. Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, when Little Golden Treasure was fast asleep in the straw pile in his home, four men wearing short blue cloth shirts and trousers suddenly broke into his house. Two people guarded the entrance of his straw hut, one person dragged Little Golden Treasure up, and one person pulled out a box gun and fired a shot at Little Golden Treasure's right temple. The bullet exited from the left side, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, hurriedly fled. At the time, neighbors were also awakened by the sound and came out to inquire, only to find that Little Golden Treasure had already died and the murderers had long escaped. They urgently reported to the First Sub-station of the Fifth District, which dispatched police officers to investigate and ordered the local leader to request the court to examine the body and provide a coffin. Meanwhile, they are pursuing the murderers.</p>
<p>A Newly Discovered Wang Mang Weight from the Xin Dynasty with Great Historical Value Found in Tianjin</p>
<p>Stolen from Shaanxi and Eventually Falls into the Hands of a British National</p>
<p>Scholars Across the Country Urge the Central Government to Find a Way to Recover It</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Ping of the Han Dynasty, Wang Mang usurped the throne and proclaimed himself emperor, changing the dynasty name to Xin. At that time, the Wang family, in order to standardize weights and measures throughout the country, personally made a wooden scale as a standard, marking the beginning of our country's reform of weights and measures. The scale is now recognized as an antique of great historical and cultural value. It was passed down through the generations until the late Qing Dynasty, when the hook of the scale was lost, leaving only one weight, preserved in the Palace Museum in Beiping. The other parts, due to the passage of time, were lost. It was not until the year before last that it was rumored that the scale's balance had once been discovered in Gansu Province. Later, when Deng Baoshan entered Shaanxi, he was entrusted by Ma Heng, the current director of the Palace Museum, to find a way to locate it so that it could be restored to its original state. After Deng arrived in Gansu, he learned that the scale was indeed stored in the Shaanxi Provincial Museum. Due to its age, the wood was slightly damaged, but it was antique and lustrous, and at a glance, it was known to be an object from thousands of years ago. It had been carefully repaired and was as good as new. Its value was immeasurable, estimated by archaeologists to be between 200,000 and 300,000 yuan. Preparations were being made to transport it to Beiping for preservation when the item was suddenly reported stolen. After various investigations, there were no results. This caused widespread regret and attention at the time. It is now heard that the ancient scale has recently been discovered in Tianjin but has fallen into the hands of a British national, reportedly purchased at a cost of millions. As for the twists and turns and inside story of this matter, Yu Youren, the president of the Control Yuan, knows the most details. He once sent someone to negotiate, hoping to redeem the ancient object at a reasonable price and return it to the country for preservation to prevent it from flowing abroad. However, the Westerner considered it a rare commodity and was unwilling to sell it unless at a high price, leading to no results. According to reporters from the Shenshi News Agency, most archaeologists and academics in the country believe that the ancient scale is extremely important to the country's history and culture and should not be lost. They have urged the government to find a way to recover it as soon as possible to value the ancient object.</p>

After the meeting began, Wang Xiaolai first reported that today was the day to commemorate Mr. Hu Xisheng of Yuyao. Mr. Hu Xisheng served in the money industry all his life, personally handling everything from his studies to being appointed as a manager, working diligently and devotedly. He also cared deeply for his hometown. Unfortunately, he passed away, and all who knew him deeply mourn his passing. In a country as vast as China, if everyone could be like Mr. Hu, unemployment in society could be reduced, and the country could be enriched and strengthened. Any difficult matter could be solved easily. People like Mr. Hu are truly models in the industry. Then, Yan Chengde reported on his life's journey, and Shao Zhonghui, Wang Yansong, Qin Runqing, Wu Zhihao, and Xu Qianlin successively gave speeches, which were not recorded in detail.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese-language newspaper, the Shanghai Daily News, the public debate organized by the Lecture Department of the East Asia Common Script College was held at the Japanese Club at 6:30 PM on the 3rd. First, Professor Otani of the Common Script College delivered an opening speech, followed by speeches by Yamauchi Masaaki of the college and Kurokawa Taro of the Commercial School. At 9:30 PM, Zhongping Qingcilang delivered a speech on the era of reviewing established religions. He opened his mouth and attacked Christianity, revealing three major shortcomings of Christianity. The audience, who believed in Christianity, were shocked to hear this. Suddenly, a young man shouted, "Have you read the Bible?" At this time, the audience in the hall became agitated. Zhongping replied, "Those who believe in Christianity are not Japanese." Thereupon, the young man became even more indignant. The pro- and anti-Christianity factions in the hall attacked each other, and the order was greatly disrupted. The organizers were extremely embarrassed and rang the bell to order Zhongping to step down in order to ease the atmosphere. However, Zhongping still refused. The shouts of the audience overflowed the surrounding area, and the murderous aura became increasingly tense. Police Chief Aijia of the Japanese Consulate General rushed to the stage and forcibly pulled Zhongping down. The storm finally subsided.</p>
<p>Zang Qifang Lectures on the Unified Economy of Japan and Manchuria</p>
<p>The Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association specially invited Zang Qifang, the general secretary of the Northeast Xiehui, to lecture on the unified economy of Japan and Manchuria the previous evening. A staff member from the Bingxun Speed ​​Recording Agency was dispatched to the scene to record the speech in shorthand. In short, the reasons why Japan wants to implement the economic integration of Japan and Manchuria are: (1) The power of capitalists in Japan is strong, and most of the assets are concentrated in the hands of a small number of people. It is difficult to maintain the livelihoods of ordinary people, and farmers feel particularly painful. (2) Japan is deeply afraid of being economically oppressed by various countries and is planning to defend against it. Its advocacy is divided into three factions: (1) The capitalists advocate Japan's industrialization and Manchuria's materialization. (A) There is no need to unify the currencies of the two places. (B) The tariff policy will prevent Manchuria's industry from developing excessively, and Japan's industry will always maintain prosperity. (2) The right-leaning proletariat advocates the complete economic integration of Japan and Manchuria, regardless of regional divisions, and moving forward in unison. (A) The tariff policy should adopt a protection policy, with Japan and Manchuria as a unit, strictly rejecting the dumping of foreign goods, so that the industries of both places can be revitalized. (2) The currencies of Japan and Manchuria should be unified. (3) The Fascist faction, that is, the military faction, advocates that Japan and Manchuria should be divided into industries. Its implementation of power lies in the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and its opinions are not much different from those of the second faction. It is extremely difficult to decide which method will be adopted in the future, and there are many difficulties. Finally, he said that we should redouble our efforts to resist goods and try to find a way for our country's economy and actively unite with various countries. Furthermore, for Japan to implement economic oppression, we should adopt coping methods.</p>

(3) Investigate the consumer price index, which will be undertaken by Fukushima of the Osaka Trade Research Institute, Matsumaru of the Board of Directors, and Takagi Sugita. (4) Investigate the landlord's interest. Regarding the ups and downs of land prices, the types of buildings, etc., calculate the original price, and also collect the profits obtained by the landlord's investment over the years from a number of experts. (5) The implementation committee will implement it after the investigation by each sub-committee.

<p>Some Stolen Funds Still Remain in the McCallum &amp; Co. Fraud Case</p>
<p>Russian Suspect's Savings Book Found in Residence</p>
<p>Chinese Suspects' Families Return Remaining Funds</p>
<p>The British, Italian, Russian, and Chinese swindlers who forged Anglo-American Tobacco Company signatures on checks to defraud the Mercantile Bank of over 130,000 yuan have been apprehended by the Public Concession Police.  Except for those criminals of British, Italian, and Portuguese nationalities who enjoy consular jurisdiction and were handed over to their respective consulates in Shanghai for trial, the Russian and Chinese suspects have been brought before the First Special District Court for trial, as previously reported. It has been learned that when the Russian suspect Joseph Ahrons was arrested, detectives found three savings books in his residence: one from the Hong Kong Commercial Bank with 1,500 yuan, one from the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank with 2,100 yuan, and one from the China &amp; South Sea Bank with 500 yuan. When Wang Chung Kan and Xie Pingfeng were arrested, 341 yuan in cash was found on them. Later, the families of Wang and Xie returned 1,500 yuan of stolen money from their homes through their defense lawyer, Fan Gang, to the police, stating that it was part of the original loot that they had taken back. Subsequently, the police investigated each bank with which the swindlers had dealings and discovered a savings account of 1,870.25 yuan under the name of the China Tobacco Leaf Company at the National Commercial Bank, and a savings account of 450 yuan in the same company's name at the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. At the Chekiang Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the swindlers had deposited 623.71 yuan in foreign currency under the name of Sakharov. All three savings accounts were seized and deposited with the police, along with the other recovered funds, and a detailed list was submitted to the First Special District Court with a request for their disposition at the time of the case's verdict.</p>
<p>Prosecution for Illegally Dumping Garbage in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Public Concession garbage boat owners are required by the authorities to transport their garbage to Longhua Mouth for disposal daily. However, these garbage boat owners often dump garbage into the Huangpu River for laziness. This behavior not only harms sanitation but also easily causes the Huangpu River to become silted up, so the authorities have repeatedly issued strict prohibitions. However, these people still violate the regulations as usual. A few days ago, the Police Chief Kai Jiesan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Unit was patrolling the Huangpu River near Longhua when he saw a large number of Public Concession garbage boat owners illegally dumping garbage from their boats into the river. He immediately arrested boat owners Zhang Fugeng, Zhang Qinpeng, Xu Jinbiao, Xu Changyuan, Xu Xiqing, Xu Aliou, Wang Defu, Tang Yufu, Xu Tangrong, Xiao Xiaoniu, Mao Jinshan, Wu Guangrong, Yang Shuhua, and others and brought them back to the station, then transferred them to the Nanshi Headquarters, where Chief Zhu conducted a preliminary hearing and then ordered the preparation of documents for transfer to the bureau for further investigation.</p>
<p>Criminal Gang Arrested for Plotting Unlawful Activities</p>
<p>Some Firearms Confiscated</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, the Chinese Inspector General of the General Inspectorate of the General Public Security Bureau, learned that a criminal gang was hiding at 438 Guangdong Road, plotting unlawful activities.  He dispatched Chinese Detective Feng Zhiming and Detective Zhang Changgui to secretly investigate at 7:30 AM the previous morning.  They arrested Shaoxing natives Shang Zhangfu (also known as "Lai Zi" [Leper]), Wang Aqih, Xu Xiangrong, Qiu Miaofa, Qiu Xianglao, and a woman, Shang Gao.  They learned from questioning that the group possessed firearms, hidden at 247 Huiguan Road in the French Concession. The detectives, together with French Concession detectives, went to the house and confiscated one handgun and 74 rounds of ammunition.  They were all taken to the police station, detained separately, and transferred to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division 1 yesterday morning.  The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, explained the circumstances of the arrest and stated that the crimes of the defendants were still under investigation, requesting permission for continued detention for investigation. Judge Qian reviewed the report and approved the postponement of the trial.</p>
<p>Master and Disciple Collaborate in Many Evildoings</p>
<p>Each Sentenced to One Year and Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wang Chengying, Chinese Detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and Yang Xiguang, Detective, arrested Jiangbei native Chen Wanzi on the afternoon of the 14th of last month near Caoxiebang, Xiaoshadu Road, and found a handgun and nine bullets on him.  Upon questioning, they learned that the handgun and bullets had been given to him by his master (i.e., "Old Man") Liu Changde, who lived at 1378 Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road.  Liu had a concubine who had been taken back to her hometown by his fellow villager, Wang Xiaolao Han, creating a deep-seated grudge.  Therefore, he gave the handgun to Chen, telling him to take it to the thatched shed on Shihuijiao in Zhabei.  The detectives secretly went to Liu's residence, arrested him, and confiscated two iron bars.  All were taken to the police station and handed over to the First Special District Court.  The police filed a public prosecution for violating the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms and Guns and attempted murder.  Liu resolutely denied the charges. Wang Yaotang, lawyer for the Public Works Department, stated that the master and disciple collaborated in illegal activities and committed many crimes and should be severely punished.  After receiving instructions, Judge Liu Yugui presided over Criminal Division 3 and sentenced Liu Changde and Chen Wanzi to one year and six months imprisonment each. The number of days of pre-trial detention shall be counted at the rate of two days to offset one day of imprisonment. The handguns, bullets, iron bars, and spears were confiscated.</p>
<p>Zhu Songquan, Accomplice in the Assassination of Sun Yadong, Convicted</p>
<p>On the afternoon of February 4th of last year, Sun Yadong, a native of Rufou, Jiangbei, was assassinated by enemies near the large culvert of the concrete water gate on the wasteland near the Public Works Bureau at 267 Ningwu Road. The murderers in this case could not be tracked down. On September 6th, detectives Shen Yuzhou and Ruan Taibin of the Yulin Road Police Station arrested a suspect, Zhu Songquan, a native of Rufou. According to him, the deceased Sun Yadong was a local bandit leader in Rufou who, in November of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], extorted silver dollars from his sister's husband, Jia Mingsheng, and burned him to death when he refused. Sun then fled to Shanghai. His sister, Zhu Ezi, tracked him down to Shanghai, discovered Sun's whereabouts, and devised a plan to lure him to dinner at the workshop at 24 Hejian Road. When Sun arrived and suddenly saw Zhu Ezi, he turned and ran away.  With the help of his friends, Li Zhenghong and Zhang, each holding iron weapons and ropes, they chased him to the aforementioned location, where they struck Sun on the head, causing him to fall to the ground. He claimed that he did not help and immediately fled back home, and he went to the scene of the incident to demonstrate. The next morning, the confession was consistent when he was sent to the First Special District Court.  A request was made to summon his sister, Zhu Ezi, to court in order to clarify the truth, but Zhu Ezi could not be reached. The defendant suddenly retracted his confession, completely denying it. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer for the Public Works Department, stated that the defendant admitted during the preliminary hearing that he and his brother-in-law were seeking revenge, and his confession at the police station was vividly detailed. He also went to the scene of the incident to demonstrate. However, he had not taken any action himself, so he should be punished appropriately. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be counted at the rate of two days to offset one day of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Qian Shaofeng Avenges Father by Killing He Zunfu; Trial Concluded</p>
<p>He Zunfu, a native of Guizhou, was in his forties. He previously held positions in the southwestern military and political circles and served as the magistrate of Annan County in Guizhou. Recently, he retired and lived idly. In August of last year, he came to Shanghai with his servant, Tian Guixiang, to travel, residing at the Datong Apartment at 45 Daode Lane, Beile Road in the French Concession. Every night, he went with friends to various singing halls, dance halls, or movie theaters in Shanghai. In early October, he was seen by Qian Shaofeng (also known as Peigao), a young student from Annan County, Guizhou (20 years old, residing at 13 Hualong Road, Yuanchang Lane in the French Concession). Qian believed that his father, Qian Bin, had been blackmailed unsuccessfully by He when he was the magistrate of Annan County three years ago and was then murdered. He had intended to seek revenge but had no opportunity. This encounter was exactly what he wanted. He bought a sharp blade and secretly followed He every day. On the evening of the 16th of that month, He went with his friend, Li Yan, to watch a movie at the Golden Grand Theater in Baxianqiao. Qian also bought a ticket and followed them in, sitting behind He. He waited until the movie paused at 10:15 PM, and the intermission just ended when Qian stepped forward, pulled out the sharp blade from his sleeve, and stabbed He twice in the chest. He then threw away the knife and ran out. He shouted in pain, and the lights in the theater were turned on. Seeing that He was covered in blood, the audience chased after the murderer. Detectives arrived and intercepted the murderer, bringing him to the police station. They sent He to Renji Hospital, where he died the following afternoon due to his injuries. The police sent Qian to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer prosecuted him for murder. Qian confessed that he killed He to avenge his father. The official ordered a written request to be sent to the Annan County government of Guizhou for investigation and a reply. These details had been previously reported. The case has now been investigated by the Annan County government, which has sent a written reply to the Second Special District Court. The court notified the police a few days ago to bring the defendant Qian Shaofeng to court. Judge Wang Gangxu questioned him in Criminal Division 1. The official had the letter from Annan County delivered to the police lawyer and the defendant's defense lawyer. After reading it, the defendant's confession was consistent with what was previously reported. The official deemed the case clear and ordered the start of the debate. After the police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, and the defendant's lawyer debated each other, the court declared the debate closed and set a date for sentencing. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Li Guocheng, Sentenced to Death, Appeals</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM on August 15th, 1931, a shooting occurred in Room 2 on the ground floor of the Fashang Xin Hotel at 113 Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession, where a Jiangbei bandit gang brutally killed their fellows, fatally shooting Xia Yongsheng, Jiang Yihan, and surnamed Xue, and injuring Zhong Ziqing. After the incident, the French Concession Police dispatched detectives to investigate the crime. They solved the case the following afternoon, arresting the criminal Yan Jinbiao (also known as Yan Er and Yan Dongpo), a native of Funing. The Second Special District Court filed a public prosecution for premeditated murder. After a trial, Yan was sentenced to death. The criminal was dissatisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Nanjing Supreme Court. As a result, the original verdict was upheld. In April of last year, the Third Branch of the High Court sent Yan to the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison, and the Shanghai District Court sent police officers to execute him. However, after Yan's arrest, his family in the Rihui Port area of ​​Southern Shanghai seized one of the main perpetrators of the case, Li Guocheng (also known as Chen Youliang), a native of Funing, in January 1932, and sent him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Second Special District Court prepared a document to bring Li back to the court, sent him to the French Concession Police for investigation, and prosecuted him. After repeated hearings, and bringing Yan to court for cross-examination, Li denied the charges. In order to investigate the evidence, the court postponed the conclusion of the verdict until December of last year. Li was sentenced to death for premeditated murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The details have been reported in previous issues. Li was dissatisfied with the judgment and retained lawyer Zhang Shijie to write a petition to the original trial court, requesting an appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The Second Special District Court has submitted the case file to the Third Branch of the High Court based on the petition. The appellant has also submitted a statement of reasons for the appeal a few days ago. It is said that the Commercial Court will summon witnesses and hold a hearing soon.</p>
<p>Robbers Escorted from Suzhou to Shanghai</p>
<p>Xu A'gen, a notorious robber from Suzhou, repeatedly formed gangs and held weapons to rob several shops in Shanghai, including the Shanhai Guan Road No. 301, a certain southern goods store on Xin Zha Road, a No. 247 Fujian Road, and a certain western clothing store on Nanjing Road. They stole property, which they divided and used. After the incident, he fled back to his hometown in Huangdai, Suzhou. The head of the Xin Zha Road police station dispatched detectives to Suzhou, where they worked with the detectives and police officers of the Huangdai Ninth Branch of the Suzhou Public Security Bureau to arrest the Xu robber at his home in Jinshan Ding. He was transferred to Shanghai and detained by the First Special District Court for trial. After investigation by the police, it was found that there were still two accomplices hiding in the village. They immediately submitted a report to the First Special District Court, prepared a document, and sent detectives to continue to Huangdai. They captured two more accomplices, Zhou A'mao and Sun Shaobing, at the Xu robber's home. They were escorted to Shanghai from Suzhou by car yesterday for interrogation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Having recently read a report in the Feb 4th edition of your newspaper about a lawsuit related to counterfeit talcum powder, as well as a letter from Shen Taiyuan, the content of which is not factual, we would like to clarify. Our company has been distributing Guangdong Guangfeng talcum powder for several decades. The trade name, trademark, and sample sheets we use are all registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Trademark Bureau. We have licenses numbered 15464, 16287, 16496, 16497, and 16498 to prove this. Last time, we discovered that Shen Taiyuan and Wang Shaoqing were counterfeiting our brand. After mediation, Shen Taiyuan published an apology in the newspaper and issued a written statement promising not to counterfeit again. Recently, they colluded with Cao Hongzhang and used the name "Guangfeng" to fraudulently obtain a license from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. They counterfeited our registered trademark and sample sheets again to sell talcum powder. This was discovered again, and along with evidence, we filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, which was postponed for further hearing. Moreover, Cao Hongzhang suddenly filed a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court after our lawsuit, as reported in various newspapers, including your newspaper's news article on the 2nd of this month. The wording of today's article is contrary to the previous one and is clearly inconsistent. Furthermore, Cao Hongzhang's claim that the shop address is "Guangdong Laoguangfeng Talcum Powder" opened at 6 Zhangshou Lane, Qiujiang Road. According to the investigation, the place is a primary school and has been sealed up by the Public Security Bureau. The fact that the number is fictitious is obvious, and can not be obscured by words. We ask that you correct it accordingly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tongren He Xu Chengxun</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>The Current Cigarette Tax Rate Causes Losses for Both the Government and Chinese Merchants; Requesting a Thorough Review and Petitioning the Government for Prompt Improvement</p>
<p>A Book by Huang Ziping</p>
<p>A proposal from Huang Ziping, a representative of the Minzhong Company, requested the industry association to vote to respond to the Ministry of Finance's request for review. The original text of the proposal stated, "Regarding the matter of the proposal, the 24 cigarette companies including Minzhong have jointly submitted a case arguing that the current cigarette tax rate treats Chinese and foreign merchants unfairly and requesting that the tax rates be revised as soon as possible for relief." This case is of great importance to the survival of the Chinese cigarette industry. Ziping and others, after repeated research, believe that the various statistical tables submitted by the Minzhong and other companies are based on the Unified Tax Gazette and the Tax Gazette, which are published by the Tax Bureau. The numbers listed in the tables must be accurate. According to these statistics, changing from a three-tier tax to a two-tier tax not only treats Chinese and foreign merchants unfairly, but also causes significant losses to government tax revenue. During the three-tier tax era, Anglo-American cigarettes used 30,472 cigarette tax stamps. During the two-tier tax era, they used 48,808 stamps. According to the unified tax regulations, one stamp is used for each box of cigarettes. In the two-tier tax era, the number of cigarettes sold by Anglo-American cigarettes increased by 18,336 boxes compared to the three-tier tax era, an increase of more than 50%. If the government continues to collect taxes at the three-tier tax rate, without any reduction, tax revenue would increase by more than 50%. During the three-tier tax era, the average monthly tax payment of Anglo-American cigarettes was approximately 2.41 million yuan. Assuming an increase of 50%, the monthly increase should be approximately 1.2 million yuan, meaning Anglo-American cigarettes should pay an average of approximately 3.61 million yuan per month. In reality, the average monthly tax payment of Anglo-American cigarettes during the two-tier tax era is only approximately 2.72 million yuan, meaning the government is actually shortchanging 890,000 yuan per month. This is the result of the tax reduction for higher-end cigarettes. From this perspective, the government shortchanges 890,000 yuan per month for Anglo-American cigarettes, and a total of 10.68 million yuan per year. This is a clear loss to the government. In contrast, Chinese cigarette companies used 68,422 cigarette tax stamps during the three-tier tax era, and 44,323 tax stamps during the two-tier tax era. The number of cigarettes sold by other Chinese cigarette companies during the two-tier tax era decreased by approximately one-third. If the government continues to collect taxes at the three-tier tax rate, without any reduction, tax revenue will naturally decrease by one-third. Other Chinese cigarette companies paid an average of approximately 2 million yuan per month during the three-tier tax era. A reduction of one-third would mean a reduction of approximately 660,000 yuan, resulting in approximately 1.34 million yuan. However, in reality, the average monthly tax payment of other Chinese cigarette companies during the two-tier tax era is approximately 2.55 million yuan. In comparison, Chinese merchants are burdened with an additional 1.21 million yuan per month, totaling 14.52 million yuan per year. This is the result of the tax increase for lower-end cigarettes. Taking all of this into account, after the implementation of the two-tier tax, the average increase in cigarette sales for Anglo-American cigarettes is one-half, but the annual tax revenue decreases by 10.68 million yuan. The average decrease in cigarette sales for Chinese merchants is one-third, but the annual tax burden increases by 14.52 million yuan. Is this not unfair treatment between Chinese and foreign merchants? At a time of bandit suppression and reconstruction, Chinese merchants dare not refuse to increase their burden for the sake of the party and the country. However, based on the above figures, although the government collects an additional 14.52 million yuan per year from Chinese merchants, it reduces the revenue from Anglo-American cigarettes by 10.68 million yuan. In other words, the government's gain from changing from a three-tier tax to a two-tier tax is only 3.84 million yuan per year, while the annual gain for Anglo-American cigarettes is 10.68 million yuan, nearly three times the government's gain. The results of the two-tier tax, in the entire cigarette tax, harm Chinese merchants and benefit Anglo-American accounting for 75% of the taxes, while the government is just 25%. From the point of view of the government, Anglo-American revenues, completely harmed the government, and the beneficiaries is Anglo-American. Alas, Chinese merchants are exhausted, bearing an extra 14.5 million in heavy tax each year. If every drop goes to the government, what else could they say. But making Anglo-American enjoy a benefit of 10.68 million in profit each year, is no different than squeezing Chinese merchant's blood and sweat to give to Anglo-American. Anglo-American had this great oppurtunity, that they had used the gained profit to lower the prices to encroach on the Chinese market, causing them to collapse from 150/160 to 40/50 in the Chinese market. This caused Chinese merchants to suffer a total of 14.5 million in taxes, and countless operating costs. On the other hand, Anglo-American only gained a total of 10 million in taxes, but countless operating costs.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>The Seriousness of Reading</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance</p>
<p>Before receiving guidance, let me briefly recount my own experiences...</p>
<p>I seem to feel that I am a person of strong will and courage, with a great capacity for understanding when it comes to reading. I am not afraid of hardship when independently exploring and savoring various problems. Under the control of real-world social and economic forces, I crawled from the trap of illiteracy into the realm of knowledge. What others may consider ordinary, has been the result of constant struggle for me. During my secondary education, I was ultimately blockaded by economic constraints, severing my connection with school education. At the time, I seemed somewhat indignant and saddened, but later I gradually came to recognize the nature of modern school education. I realized that schools are clubs for the majority of wealthy young men, places for the consumption of surplus value, shelters for impoverished scholars, and mere embellishments in national governance. What qualifications did someone like me have to participate in such a venue?</p>
<p>A severe environment threatened me, the boredom of life stimulated me, the giant wheel of the times shook me, and the potential of life urged me on, forcing me to hope for achievement. I eventually embarked on the path of self-study. However, there were great obstacles facing me: first, I had no like-minded friends to discuss topics with; second, my economic power was too weak to purchase some self-study tools and books; moreover, my own experience was too shallow, my understanding of writing was too vague, so how could I possibly determine the goals of self-study?</p>
<p>For the sake of life, my time was taken away; for the sake of life, my thoughts were disrupted. Moreover, I originally lacked a strong body and could not excessively engage in reading (I am not neglecting health preservation), and I really feared that illness would leave me without money for treatment, thus accelerating my self-destruction. So how could I pursue self-study?</p>
<p>Therefore, I struggled within the realm of possibility. Because I had no friends, I felt lonely in life. Occasionally, I read some literary books, which allowed me to obtain sympathy and resonance, and my heart felt a burst of joy and comfort. Gradually, this led me to pay attention to the cultivation of writing skills. My inner sorrow and loneliness forced me to write articles to vent the anger in my chest and console my lonely heart. This accumulation led me to a deeper understanding of literature and art, arousing great interest.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to international unrest, our nation and country have become increasingly decadent and collapsed. Various political theories are intricate and diverse, rising like wind and clouds. Our society is like a tangled mess, and our future is as dark as lacquer. However, I feel that this phenomenon is definitely not a product of a single moment. Of course, there are many distant and near causes. Because of wanting to understand the trajectory of social evolution, I read history. Seeking the structure of modern society, I read various treatises on social science, which gradually allowed me to gain some concepts.</p>
<p>The above is my experience of self-study. In short, my reading was not predetermined by any goals or plans, but was due to the pressure of the environment and the impulse of vitality, striving independently within the realm of possibility. My attitude towards reading has three principles: first, to develop my individuality, cultivate corresponding interests, and nurture my strengths and talents; second, to find ways to contribute my self-awareness and strength to our society at any time; and third, to satisfy my needs in life (I have no excessive desire for enjoyment, this certainly does not refer to an extremely luxurious life) and improve my environment. I cannot learn from many scholars who study diligently, only plowing and not asking about the harvest; nor can I learn from the general utilitarian pursuit of quick success and instant benefits for the sake of life. I sincerely hope that you can give me some corrections and guidance. I also hope that you can show me a more effective method and steps. Li Siqi</p>
<p>We greatly value Mr. Li's arduous reading experience, so although his letter is very [good], we agree and admire, and have almost nothing else to say. However, we are still publishing the letter, just to encourage other readers not to be discouraged. Mr. Li is a successful person who has striven from "illiteracy" to "being able to read" and "being able to write." He can serve as our model.</p>
<p>However, in Mr. Li's letter, it further proves that the principles of this department's "guidance" are different from general schools and are correct. As Mr. Li said, "My reading was not predetermined by any goals or plans, but was due to the pressure of the environment and the impulse of vitality, striving independently within the realm of possibility." If this is interpreted as struggling for life on the one hand and striving for the pursuit of knowledge on the other, this is completely correct. However, within this realm of learning, it is imperative to set goals and establish plans. Because this limited time should not be wasted, and precious energy cannot be used in vain. I hope that not only Mr. Li will pay attention to this point, but also that all self-studying friends will not ignore it. This column has discussed "reading plans" several times, and paying attention to the goals of self-study is not empty talk, but is closely related to practical life. In a kind of arduous struggle, silently and perseveringly learn a little knowledge of life, in order to participate in today's complex social life, not to be conquered by evil forces, and gradually enter a bright realm with a future.</p>
<p>Speaking of the attitude of reading, this column has already given many hints. Regarding the three principles mentioned in the letter, we feel that there is still room for discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's attitude is too biased towards the "individual" aspect. If you continue to do it according to Mr. Li's attitude, the second goal may not be achieved. That is, what you learn from an individual starting point may not be able to contribute to society, and society may not need it. We believe that before the conditions of the "individual," we must also take social practice and the requirements of the times as prerequisites, because the purpose of society is also the purpose of the individual, and the purpose of man can only be achieved after the purpose of society is achieved. Therefore, "individuality," "[interests]," "talent," and the individual's material "needs" can only occupy a [place] under the premise and cannot become the only condition.</p>
<p>As for the most "effective method and steps," it is best to carefully check your life's practice again and make a plan for future research. We believe that since you have read a lot, you might as well jump out of the books, open your eyes and take a look at China's practice. You can learn more from reality, and at the same time, it can provide you with material for difficult research. It is the proper order to go from reading to practical use.</p>

<h3>The Value of Time</h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>The value of time, of course, has its nobility and baseness, and cannot be generalized. "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold" is valuable in the eyes of Da Yu. Even passing by his home three times without entering, showed how important he considered his time in office. Therefore, in a short nine years, he was able to channel the nationwide floods back to the sea, achieving immortal achievements.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must think of our Mr. Tao Kan, who "moves and practices labor." He was a practitioner who went a step further and cherished "every minute." Therefore, he was able to become a famous minister of his generation, and is still worshiped today.</p>
<p>Looking at modern celebrities again; what about the oil tycoon who earns one hundred gold dollars per second; what about the Iron Chancellor who works twenty hours a day? The value of their time has reached the pinnacle, and cannot be more expensive.</p>
<p>Only we, the masters of your esteemed China, must change our valuation of time;</p>
<p>In the arenas of luxurious indulgence and frenzied revelry, "an evening of pleasure is worth a thousand gold coins," and the value is indeed not cheap. A game of poker, eight rounds of mahjong, although time-consuming, is also worth a few coins, so you can't say that he is a lazy person who wastes time.</p>
<p>As for those who do not distinguish day and night, trying to gain access to the doors of important people, traveling by special cars and airplanes on the road to officialdom, they are even more "virtuous people of today," enough to rival the former philosophers and look down on the great old men of the country. Time is certainly very valuable.</p>
<p>Those friends who crack melon seeds, listen to the drums, plan three meals a day, and listen to a song at night, seem to be wasting a lifetime of time in a drunken stupor, which seems very worthless; but if you calculate it for him, a lifetime of clothing, food, housing, and transportation also has a considerable cost.</p>
<p>Therefore, to sum up, estimating the time of modern Chinese people is not worthless. The difference is that they "spend money to buy time" rather than "sell time for money." Therefore, other people's time becomes more and more valuable, while our time gets worse and worse.</p>
<p>"Wang Xiaoer celebrates the New Year, hoping for next year this year, each year worse than the last," and the matter is ruined by this word "hope." Why do you have to "hope?" Wouldn't it be better to "do" it right away? If you only hope and don't do it, of course each year will be worse than the last.</p>
<h3>Chili and Olives</h3>
<p>— Shuofeng</p>
<p>If you connect chili and olives together, I think it's best to use them to symbolize love between men and women. The taste of chili is in the "present moment." Its momentum is fierce and spicy, instantly numbing your mouth and tongue, creating a feeling of extreme pleasure. But after eating it, there is no ulterior motive, no lingering charm to be found. The taste of olives is "behind." At first, it may taste like chewing wax, almost forcing you to spit it out, but the more you eat it later, the more flavorful it becomes. After eating, you still feel a lingering sweet aftertaste.</p>
<p>A man's affection is like chili, bursting with heat at the beginning. Everyone will use tank-like force to encircle the woman they adore in the early stages of love. Any shameful and shameless things can be done in front of the woman. Once she is in hand, the heat drops sharply. This is a linear, unrestrained emotion, the taste is strong but temporary. A woman's affection is like an olive, always silent at the beginning. When she is in love, she may give you a few rejections. Neither left nor right will do. Once she allows you, its power will increase day by day. This is a curvilinear, roundabout emotion, the taste is light but eternal. Therefore, before marriage, it is the period when women enjoy the spicy taste of men's chili. After marriage, it is the period when men enjoy the aftertaste of women's olives. Therefore, the smartest men should marry several times, and don't be afraid that women won't obey you, sir. The smartest women don't have to worry about no men serving you, miss.</p>
<p>Random Talk, Random Day</p>
<h3>Psychological Experiment</h3>
<p>— Qian Yun 作文栋 Liang 作画</p>
<p>It's really interesting to wander around the world, they see through people's psychology, and know that if you want other people's money to go into your own pocket, you have to show something "good-looking." Although swallowing a sword is said to be asking for money and not life, if their faces don't turn red, muscles don't tense, and saliva doesn't flow, who would be willing to spend money?</p>
<p>Especially the temper of the Chinese people, they only feel happy when others are in pain. Do you think this is an exaggeration? To put it most obviously: when you see someone fall on the road, you clap your hands and laugh. Who will help them up? If a fire breaks out next door, unless they fear it will spread to their own house, they will really bake rice cakes on the wall to eat.</p>
<h3>Listen or Not, It's Up to You</h3>
<p>— Meteor</p>
<p>Some people say: A dancing girl is like Chang'e during the day, and a living ghost at night. Isn't a prostitute the same?</p>
<p>Only when someone is sick, do they know what it's like to be sick, and what methods to use to treat it. But when the country is sick, I don't see any wonderful doctors to treat the country in our esteemed China.</p>
<p>The most foolish and lowly people in the world are the common people. The quickest people now are those who like to tell the truth.</p>
<p>The bitter smile of the weak is exchanged for cold mockery and fervent scolding without cost. The value of a rich man who throws money to the poor is not as good as a poor man who gives them sympathy. The disputes between people cannot escape the word "confusion." Conversely, it is the word "understanding."</p>
<h3>Interesting Little News</h3>
<p>— Peiyu</p>
<p>The most difficult autographs or letters to obtain are those of the Pope, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, American aviator Colonel Lindbergh, and Swedish film star Greta Garbo.</p>
<p>The smallest person in the world is a native of Bosnia. He is already over sixty years old, but his body is only nineteen and a half inches long. He makes a living by farming, and has repeatedly refused invitations to perform.</p>
<p>According to the survey of the previous year, the number of submarines was the highest in the United States, with a total of eighty-two; France was second, with eighty (but twenty-nine more will be manufactured); Japan was third, with sixty; the United Kingdom was fourth, with a total of fifty-three; Italy was the lowest, with only forty-six.</p>
<p>In Romania, boarders in soldiers' and policemen's barracks, and large and small schools, are not allowed to eat white bread, and can only substitute it with rye bread and a kind of hard porridge made from corn. If next year is a bumper year, this ban will be lifted.</p>
<p>The use of spices in the United States is the most widespread. The annual business of spices, perfumes, bath salts, etc. totals six million British pounds. Many car salespersons sprinkle high-quality perfume in their cars to lure female customers.</p>
<p>Cars driven by Berlin doctors must now be equipped with an extra lamp. This lamp shows a red cross on a green background. This way, if something goes wrong on the road and emergency medical treatment is needed, the police can see the car with this lamp and stop it, and immediately send the person in need of emergency medical treatment inside to ask the doctor to perform surgery, which can save a lot of time and help ensure the safety of life.</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty-Fourth</p>
<p>Drinking and Dining in Wild Merriment</p>
<p>Reading and Warming Dreams Under the Lamp, Singing Softly</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang reluctantly let out a bitter smile, nodding and saying; Isn't that so? There are many who bring their families too. Guizhi was still holding that telegram paper in her hand, looking at Zhao Ziqiang, and then at her mother, Jiang, but she didn't say anything. Jiang raised her chin, seemingly wanting to sigh, but seeing the anxious look on her daughter's face, she immediately held back the sigh, without making a sound. Zhao Weng said; Didn't the telegram mention anything else? As he spoke, he stared at his son with his eyes wide open. Ziqiang already knew his intention, so he said; It's nothing, nothing. Battalion Commander Bao always can't leave me, and refuses to let me shoulder any burden, so it doesn't matter if I stay at home for two or three more days, but I'll make him anxious in the battalion, and I feel bad about it in my heart. Zhao Weng stroked his beard and said; That's right. Battalion Commander Bao treats you like a brother, you can't let Battalion Commander Bao worry.</p>
<p>Of course, you newlyweds should linger together for a few more days, but you will be together until old age, and the future days are long. Zhao Ziqiang frowned and said; Official matters are naturally important, but these days are really a bit too fast. He and his father said this and that, and the Jiang mother and daughter listened dumbfounded on the side, without saying a word. Zhao Weng saw that the two of them didn't chime in, and felt that it was meaningless to keep talking, so he raised his hand and kept stroking his long beard. Zhao Ziqiang saw his father's embarrassed look, and just echoed his father's words, also feeling bored, so he turned his head and coughed twice in a row. Zhao Weng touched his beard with his hand, but his eyes were gazing at Guizhi, and looking at his eyes so focused, you could tell that he was very concerned and waiting for Guizhi's reply. Because her father-in-law's eyes were fixed on her body, Guizhi couldn't pretend to be oblivious anymore, so she turned her face to Jiang and shrugged, saying; Mom, naturally official business is the most important. After saying that, she turned her face to look at Ziqiang and said; There's a long-distance bus entering the city today, I'll pack your luggage for you. (238)</p>
<h3>Letting Go of the Oar at Yanling Shoal</h3>
<p>— Long Yu</p>
<p>Having left Yan Futuo as the shore of the Yan Shu Guan Town, it was still the thin cold of six o'clock in the morning. He and Yi提 carried travel bags and hurried down the uneven stone embankment. There was a fishing boat of Chun Jiang moored there, which a young boat girl rowed over with an oar. She only opened her eyes to look at the unfamiliar guests, without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Is this the boat of the Chen family?" Zhi asked her in the Mandarin of the Jiangnan region.</p>
<p>"Are you not going to the Xi Diao Tai (Playful Fishing Terrace)?" She asked us, with a knowing look in her eyes.</p>
<p>However, we did not answer, and seeing the boat docking, we jumped into the cabin. In fact, at this time of the late winter season, who would come here to see the seven-mile cool scenery? Last night, we sailed from Lanxi on a night boat to Yan Dong Guan. Among the passengers disembarking, besides Yi and me, all were farmers and small merchants.</p>
<p>Our boat pierced through the white, misty morning and twisted its way into the Seven Mile Long. Black Dragon Mountain and South Peak were all buried in silvery-gray dreams, only vaguely showing faint blue-black marks, connecting in the distance with a misty, damp haze.</p>
<p>The clear waves of this Seven Mile Long were as blue as bright crystal, with a bell-like clarity. The stones at the bottom of the Long were paved flat, one by one; lying on the side of the boat, you could count your own strands of hair. Often, one or two exquisite gulls emerged from the water, turning their eyes to watch the passing boats. As the sound of oars drew near, they either spread their wings and flew into the sky or disappeared into the water.</p>
<p>We were going downstream, taking advantage of the water's momentum to head straight for Yanling Mountain. The mountains along the way were steep and beautiful, elegant and serene, and the water was clear and meandering. The golden yellow sandbars and the white rustling reeds were all in the background of the sunny winter day, so implicitly filled with poetic and artistic charm. And the Seven Mile Long was temporarily without any other boats, all under our control.</p>
<p>At this time, the fisherman, while rowing the oar, pointed out the scenic spots of the rivers and mountains and told us about the flavor of the Lu fish below Yanling Shoal. Oh! Wasn't this the same type of giant-mouthed, fine-scaled fish that Su Dongpo tasted at the Red Cliff? And also the Lu fish that Yan Ziling, the friend of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty, fished for while escaping fame! How many people today don't want to curry favor with wealthy and powerful officials and generals, but are willing to spend their lives in raincoats and straw hats?</p>
<p>"Can you catch us a few?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Sure! When you go to the Playful Fishing Terrace, just cast the net and you'll get some," he replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Spurred on by the wonderful name of Lu fish, Yi and I alike swallowed our saliva. He leaned on the railing, searching the waves for the shadows of fish crossing the river. I asked the fisherman again:</p>
<p>"Then, how much further is it from here to the Fishing Terrace?"</p>
<p>"It's almost time for the end of the morning period. Once we leave the Changjian Pier, we'll be there. Now we're in Lan Shui Wu, only three miles away."</p>
<p>Indeed, the sunlight shone on the mountains, on the river, and on us, but not on the boat girl's face, because she was wearing such a large round hat. The sun seemed as warm as in autumn, and the water was not made muddy by the light, but instead became even bluer and clearer.</p>
<p>At noon, it was extremely quiet. There were no other boats on the water, no birds singing in the mountains, and we were not talking either, as if in the environment of ancient times. He and Yi slept on the deck, watching the white clouds fly by in the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the fisherman turned his head and shouted with a laugh:</p>
<p>"Guests, look, isn't that the Fishing Terrace?"</p>
<p>Immediately, Yi quickly sat up and looked in the direction the fisherman pointed. Sure enough, in the green and majestic peaks and embroidered ridges, there was a mountain path, like a winding silver snake, heading up the mountain. The mountain did not seem very high. In the red trees at the foot of the mountain, we saw a white-walled ancestral hall and the iron-stone-colored Fishing Terrace on the hillside. Oh! The fairyland I had dreamed of!</p>
<p>With only a short distance to go, the boat docked on the large stone of the Fishing Terrace. Thereupon, I, holding a wine bottle, and Yi hurriedly jumped ashore to pay our respects to the great hermit of the Han Dynasty, whose noble character would last for a thousand years! Turning back to the fisherman, I said:</p>
<p>"Don't forget to catch us a few Lu fish!"</p>
<p>"Got it...." The voice gradually faded away.</p>

<p>Major Upheaval in Elementary Education in Hunan Province</p>
<p>Teachers and Staff Fight for a Way Out, Forming Two Camps</p>
<p>The Education Department Insists on Hiring Normal School Graduates as Elementary School Teachers</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Zhu Jingnong, Director of the Hunan Education Department, is currently issuing Instruction No. 1502 of the Education Department in accordance with the elementary school regulations promulgated by the Ministry, starting this spring semester. All teachers in provincial elementary schools, municipal and county elementary schools, district-run joint elementary schools, and private senior elementary schools must first be hired from among normal school graduates, in order to implement the reorganization of elementary school teachers. This has caused a great upheaval. The non-normal school teachers in elementary schools in Changsha City and County first rose up in opposition. On January 30th, they held a meeting at the Changsha City Education Association and decided to establish the "Changsha City and County Public and Private Elementary School Teachers and Staff Vocational Maintenance Association." They elected Lin Kang, Yong Xisheng, and thirteen others as representatives to organize a maintenance association delegation to be responsible for carrying out all matters. On the 31st, they first went to the Changsha Municipal Government and the Changsha County Education Bureau to petition, explaining that it is proper to hire normal school graduates as elementary school teachers, but those who have dedicated themselves to the elementary education field for many years, or who have passed examinations and have considerable achievements, cannot be completely discarded. They demanded that before this upheaval is resolved, no changes to teachers and staff should be made in various county and municipal elementary schools; otherwise, they will not be responsible for any disputes that arise. They also petitioned the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government, requesting that they forward the petition to the Education Department to withdraw its order, and telegraphed all counties in the province, calling on teachers and staff of elementary schools to establish vocational maintenance sub-associations of public and private elementary school teachers and staff in their respective counties and cities, to carry out a large-scale opposition. At the same time, normal school graduates from Provincial No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, and No. 1 Normal School also jointly petitioned various senior party and government organs, supporting the Education Department's plan to reorganize elementary school teachers and give priority to hiring normal school graduates, advocating that non-normal school graduate elementary school teachers should be examined and certified in accordance with Article 78 of the elementary school regulations promulgated by the Ministry, and only then can they be hired after normal school graduates are hired. They cannot be allowed to mingle in the elementary education field based on empty words such as excellent performance or years of school management. Thus, the elementary education field in Hunan Province has formed two camps due to the struggle for a way out. The situation is gradually becoming serious. Director Zhu of the Education Department, fearing that outsiders do not understand the truth, made a statement to the press as follows: "There is a contradictory phenomenon in the qualifications of elementary school teachers in Hunan Province. According to reports from the county school inspectors, there are elementary school graduates who are serving as elementary school principals, and there are elementary school students who are serving as elementary school teachers. Moreover, Daoists, shamans, tailors, and carpenters are occupying lecturing platforms in many places. At the same time, the government spends huge sums of money to train normal school graduates, but most of them are left idle. Repeated orders have been issued to the counties to hire them, but they are all treated as mere formalities. Last time, Inspector Wu Yan of the Ministry of Education, after inspecting various counties, was also surprised by this phenomenon. For the sake of rectifying the source and purifying the stream, it is appropriate for elementary school teachers to be staffed by normal school graduates, just as military officers should be staffed by military academy graduates, and engineers should be staffed by engineering school graduates. Speaking of reorganization, I also know it is difficult, so I only stipulated that provincial elementary schools, municipal and county elementary schools, district-run joint elementary schools, and private senior elementary schools are the scope of implementation. These four types of elementary schools account for no more than 800 schools in the entire province, while there are more than 23,000 elementary schools in the entire province. The elementary schools that are stipulated for reorganization account for no more than one-thirtieth of the total number of elementary schools on the surface, and in reality, there are still fourteen remote counties that are allowed to handle the matter with flexibility. As for teachers who do not meet the required qualifications but have teaching ability and experience, I am determined not to let them be discarded. Last month, I telegraphed the Ministry of Education to promptly issue examination regulations. Soon, a reply telegram was received, stating that they will be announced soon. Yesterday, I also telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that if the regulations cannot be announced temporarily, the province should be allowed to draft temporary examination rules first, so as to avoid prolonged delays. These teachers can be freely hired in the remaining 22,000 schools, temporarily excluding the above 800 schools. I believe there will be no major difficulties. This matter must be carried out and will not be changed. I sincerely hope that colleagues in the elementary education field will understand this and treat each other with sincerity," and so on. However, the Elementary School Teachers and Staff Vocational Maintenance Association is firmly opposed, and it is not yet known how it will end. (February 1)</p>
<p>Overview of Education in Zhejiang Province (3)</p>
<p>Summary of Two Lectures by Inspector Xia of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>(5) Regarding Elementary Education</p>
<p>The total number of school-age children in the province is approximately 2,406,040, of which only 698,146 are in school. Out-of-school children account for more than 60% (the failure to popularize compulsory education can be inferred). Moreover, due to the financial difficulties of various counties, they are unable to comply with the Ministry's first phase of compulsory education implementation measures. At present, they can only issue the establishment of township-level junior elementary school measures, which stipulates that each township should establish at least one junior elementary school as the basis for the initial implementation of compulsory education. Currently, among the 12,474 townships in the province, the number of townships that have established junior elementary schools is 7,996, accounting for about two-thirds. The current number of elementary schools in the province is 7,569 public schools, 5,521 private schools, 70 short-term elementary schools, 174 short-term elementary school classes, and 4,430 private schools. The number of schools listed above still needs to be increased as much as possible in order to achieve the popularity of compulsory education.</p>
<p>Due to differences in area, financial resources, etc. among various counties and cities, the level of development of elementary education also varies greatly. The quality of the prosperous areas is quite different from that of the remote areas. The most well-managed ones are the affiliated elementary schools of the provincial middle schools and the central elementary schools of the counties and cities. There are eleven of the former in the province, belonging to eleven school districts, and there were 186 of the latter in the 21st year. These two types of elementary schools are both responsible for guidance and experimentation, so all facilities can serve as models for other schools.</p>
<h3>(6) Regarding Social Education</h3>
<p>Social education expenditures account for 12.5% of the province's education expenditures, and the total social education expenditures of counties and cities also account for 12.25% of the total education expenditures, both of which have reached the minimum standard set by the Ministry. However, the percentage of social education expenditures in various counties and cities varies greatly (from 6% to 22%). There are one city and thirteen counties where the standard set by the Ministry has not been reached.</p>
<p>There are currently 2,370 people's schools, with a total of 2,904 classes, which is still 146 classes short of the 3,050 classes set in the minimum standards for operating people's schools in counties and cities, as stipulated by the Education Department last year. Most of the facilities are jointly operated by middle and elementary schools, and most of the teachers are also part-time, so the efficiency is not significant. This school piloted the full-time system, stipulating that each county must set up a county-run people's school or a central people's school in each school district, in addition to the people's schools jointly operated by schools. This system has not been widely promoted, and there are still not many specially established schools.</p>
<p>There are 105 people's education centers that have already been established, and 28 are in progress but have not yet been established, which is about three-quarters short of the planned 415 centers. In addition, attention is also paid to undertakings such as libraries and popular lectures.</p>
<p>The operation of people's schools is relatively practical, and the results of eliminating illiteracy have also been considerable. However, most people's education centers, except for a few, still tend to focus on form and have few opportunities to approach the people. This phenomenon is a common problem across the country, not just in Zhejiang Province. (The End)</p>

<h3>Fewer Students in Private Schools This Semester Due to Economic Downturn</h3>
<p>Ordinary Families Can No Longer Afford Education</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the economic panic and the downturn in various industries, schools have also been affected. This semester, various schools in the city have already started classes. According to surveys conducted by reporters from the Shanghai News Agency at general schools, the result of enrollment in private schools this semester is that the number of students has decreased by one-third compared with the previous semester. Dropouts are everywhere, especially in secondary schools. Because municipal schools charge less tuition, the number of applicants is higher. However, due to the limited number of places, those who are ambitious but unable to afford it still regret it. Therefore, it is hoped that the education authorities must find ways to increase the number of municipal schools on the one hand and reduce the tuition fees of private schools on the other, so that ordinary families will not be affected by the economic panic and drop out of school midway.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Association Will Convene a Meeting of Principals of Public and Private Schools Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association believes that most public and private schools in the city rent school buildings, and the high rents in recent years have had a great impact on the future of education. After separate investigations and registrations, it has scheduled a meeting of all school principals in the city at the association's location on Dajie Road at 1:00 PM today to discuss ways to reduce rents.</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai Succeeds Bai Jichang as Principal of Minli Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>The School Board Held Its First Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Xingya Was Elected Chairman of the Board</p>
<p>The local private Minli Girls' Middle School had its principal Wang Suben resign after Secretary Wu Dazao promoted red tendencies with the Rough Weave Drama Club and was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters. The school board has also been reorganized. As previously reported, the new school board held its first meeting at the East Asia Restaurant at 5:00 PM yesterday. School board members Tong Xingbai, Wu Xingya, Qian Xinzhi, Wu Yansong, Wu Yiting, Chen Jicheng, Huang Xianggu, Zhu Xuefan, Jiang Hongtian, Zhu Yinong, Zhu Xiangwan, Liu Yazi, and others attended the meeting. Chen Jicheng chaired the meeting, and Huang Xianggu served as the recorder. (A) Reporting Matters: (Omitted). (B) Discussion Matters: (1) The proposal to elect a chairman of the school board was passed, electing Mr. Wu Xingya as chairman of the school board. (2) The proposal to elect a principal of the school was passed, electing Mr. Tong Xingbai as the principal. (3) Former principal Wang Suben requested that the new principal be responsible for handling the debts owed by him during his tenure. It was resolved that the new principal should take over, report the details, and then verify. (4) School board member Tang Guanben-nan is the founder of the school and should be invited to continue serving in the school to assist in school affairs, and his children should also receive free education to reward the original intention of the founding. The proposal was passed. (5) The affiliated elementary school of the school should be handled independently by Mr. Wang Suben, but the school name must be changed to Ben-yan Elementary School to be permanent. The proposal was passed. (6) The school library should be named Ben-zou Library in memory. The proposal was passed. (7) If the founder's children come to the school to study, their tuition fees should be waived. The proposal was passed. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The Business School's Specialized Courses Have Not Yet Determined a Termination Plan</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education ordered the five major universities in Shanghai to terminate their specialized courses, President Pei of the National Shanghai Business School has stated that the Ministry's order allows each school to determine its own termination plan and does not specify a phased termination. Therefore, he is still considering how to proceed. Recently, the students of the school's specialized courses held a meeting and organized a school protection association to petition the school authorities. Yesterday, according to reliable sources from the school, how to terminate the specialized courses has not yet been decided. The rumors circulating outside are not credible. The statement made by President Pei to the students, as reported in the newspaper a few days ago, also differs greatly from the original meaning. In short, the school must abide by the Ministry's order on the one hand and consider the future of the students' studies on the other. Furthermore, President Pei of the school went to Beijing a few days ago to ask Minister Wang for instructions on everything.</p>
<p>Students of the School of Law and Politics Ask the School Authorities to Quickly Determine a Plan</p>
<p>A Meeting Was Held Yesterday and a Committee Was Organized</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education issued instructions to the five schools in Shanghai—Soochow University, Chih Tze University, Law and Politics University, Soochow University, and the National Business School—to suspend night schools, Soochow University and Soochow University have already contacted the Ministry of Education through the school authorities. However, since President Zhang Zhongdao of the School of Law and Politics is in Beijing and has not returned, and Dean of Academic Affairs Zhou Xinmin is unable to take responsibility, there has been no way to resolve the matter since receiving the instructions from the Ministry of Education, causing the night school students to initiate a meeting of night school students at the Fuxu Tongyi Middle School at 1:00 PM yesterday to discuss solutions. More than 40 students attended the meeting, and the National Shanghai Business School also sent two representatives to attend as observers. Chairman Tong Chuangu presided over the meeting. First, the chairman reported the significance of the meeting. Then, regarding the Ministry of Education's suspension of night schools, it was unanimously decided to ask the school authorities to quickly decide on a plan. In addition, three people were elected from each class, a total of nine people, to form a committee to be responsible for this matter. The meeting then adjourned. Afterwards, according to the person in charge of the association, this meeting was purely internal. The previous news that the school jointly held a meeting with the five universities was completely misreported.</p>
<h3>Jidda University's January Salary Distribution</h3>
<p>Following his return to Shanghai from Beijing last Friday, Shen Pengfei, the acting president of Jidda University, immediately went to the university to handle official duties and prepare for the start of the semester. He has been extremely busy. Furthermore, the university's accounting and cashiering duties were previously handled by accountants hired by President Zheng. Acting President Shen has cancelled this practice. However, President Zheng still entrusted the accountants with distributing the full January salaries for all faculty and staff. A notice has been issued to all faculty and staff, informing them to collect their salaries from the accountants immediately and to complete the collection within five days, in order to facilitate the handover of accounting records.</p>
<p>Municipal Education Association Private Schools to Start Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association established over twenty public schools in various districts of the city last semester. A one-week winter vacation began on January 29th and has now ended. All schools will uniformly commence classes today. Furthermore, the association sent personnel to inspect the various public schools last semester, and the results were satisfactory. It is reported that the association will further strengthen supervision this semester to promote improvement.</p>
<p>Qiaoguang Middle School Expands Elementary Department</p>
<p>Qiaoguang Middle School relocated to its new address in Nanyuan, Xinzha Road, this semester. Due to ample school buildings and surplus classrooms, lush trees and beautiful scenery on campus, and particularly well-equipped sports grounds, and considering the large number of residents in the surrounding area, it is highly suitable to expand the elementary department to facilitate children's education. The school specially submitted an application to the Education Bureau for approval the other day. To encourage children from poor families to attend at the beginning of the establishment, the school has specially set up many fee reduction and half-fee quotas. It is reported that many people have been enthusiastically registering in recent days. Principal Ma Canhan of the middle school, in addition to striving for material construction, pays particular attention to spiritual development. It is reported that the school has hired many new faculty and staff this semester, such as Mr. Qian Zhenhai, all of whom are experienced and knowledgeable individuals. In the future, they will focus on strict training in student management and discipline, in order to cultivate well-rounded talents.</p>
<h3>Improvements at Minhua Vocational Middle School</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Cai Xiaohe took over as principal of Minhua Vocational Middle School on Kang Nao Tu Road, Yanping Road in this city this semester, he has been actively reorganizing all school affairs, strictly implementing the guidance system, and hired Mr. Yang Yuqi, who has a wealth of academic experience, as the school's Dean of Studies. All full-time teachers in each department are knowledgeable individuals. In addition to the original departments in the junior high school, a sewing department has been added, exclusively for female students, taught by Ms. Zhong Shuyun, a graduate of the Sewing Department of the Chinese Vocational Education Society, to meet the needs of the National Products for Women Year. Furthermore, the school's affiliated elementary school is currently headed by Mr. Yue Tai. Mr. Yue has extensive experience in elementary education, and all grade-level homeroom teachers are female teachers who are good at guiding and inspiring students. It is reported that the elementary school started on February 1st, and the middle school is scheduled to start on February 12th. As the start of classes approaches, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic in recent days.</p>
<p>New Development in Vocational Supplementary Education</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Community Federation and the China Vocational Education Society jointly formed a Vocational Supplementary Education Committee to design, promote, and research vocational supplementary education. Yesterday, the committee held a regular meeting at the Nanjing Road Commercial Supplementary School. Committee members including Jiang Wenyu, Zhou Juchen, Zhao Ai Wu, Ji Jiannan, Wang Lianfang, and Sun Wenyi discussed various important issues. It was decided to greatly expand the Commercial Supplementary School by renting the newly built three-story building west of the New World Company as school buildings. In addition to night classes and wireless telegraphy Chinese language classes, morning and day classes for young shop assistants will be added. The day classes will recruit students with a junior high school education and provide them with short-term, practical training. After one semester, they will be sent to various companies on Nanjing Road for trial employment. Director Zhao Ai Wu of the school has been appointed to plan everything, and recruitment advertisements will be published in newspapers soon.</p>
<p>Tongde Medical College Building New School Buildings</p>
<p>Tongde Medical College on Tongfu Road in this city is organized by a purely German medical department. Since its establishment in the seventh year of the Republic of China, it has been fifteen years. The perfection of its management and the excellence of its achievements have long been recognized by society. It is now reported that the college's original school buildings are insufficient for expansion due to the increase in school affairs. After negotiation, Mr. Rong Zongjing, a giant in the business community of this city, agreed to donate more than nine acres of land on Zhongshan Road as the college's base, and a construction committee has been organized to prepare for the project, which has been underway for many days. Now that various plans have been finalized, fundraising will begin immediately in the hope of starting construction as soon as possible. It is learned that the total cost of the construction is estimated at 150,000 national currency, and the greatness of the plan can be imagined. Many people in all circles of this city who are concerned about public welfare will surely follow Mr. Rong and rise up in response. In the near future, the newest and most perfect medical college will appear before our eyes, which is truly a celebration for the future of the medical community in our country.</p>
<p>The Chinese Education Association Recruits Teachers</p>
<p>The Chinese School Staff Federation of this city was entrusted by a certain provincial girls' middle school in Anhui Province yesterday to recruit a female physical education and Girl Scout instructor with a monthly salary of one hundred yuan. In addition, a certain girls' middle school in this city entrusted the federation to recruit a female Chinese and English teacher who must be a graduate of a church university or a church middle school with a degree from a famous university to qualify. The monthly salary is generous. Those who wish to apply should contact the federation on the second floor of the Shanghai Bank in Ximen as soon as possible. Schools that need to entrust the federation to recruit various talents can also be sought on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Second Inter-Port Football Trial Match All Performances Were Wonderful and Satisfactory</h3>
<p>Mixed Colors Team Wins First, Resulting in a 3-3 Draw</p>
<p>East China Players Absent, Audience Decreases</p>
<p>The second Shanghai Inter-Port football trial match was held at Shen Wan yesterday afternoon. The two teams were distinguished by white and mixed colors. The game ended in a 3-3 draw. Both sides performed wonderfully and the situation was particularly tense, making it very interesting. However, due to the absence of five East China players, there were only about two hundred people in the general seating area, while the special seats were still full, with over two thousand people. The technical skills of each player were generally satisfactory. Perhaps Shanghai has a glimmer of hope for the future of the Inter-Port matches.</p>
<p>Wonderful Performance Not Diminished by East China Absences</p>
<p>The fact that five East China players would not participate in the trial match had already been reported in the newspapers, and the Western Union had made preparations in advance. In addition, Xu Yahui had not returned from Xiamen, and Ke Laite was sick. The two teams were short a total of seven players. In addition to substituting reserve players Fu Lu Shou and Mao Lin, Kang Pudan and Wei Sheng from Huasesi, Hui Sihe from Xibu, Hua Te from Fachang, and Jin Bo from Xishang were added to make up the numbers. Unfortunately, Fu Lu Shou was injured and left the field a few minutes after entering the game. Thus, the white team had to play with only ten players. In the second half, Qiong Si from Huasesi filled in as the white team's goalkeeper. Even so, the performance was not diminished by the absence of the five East China players. Everyone played hard. The players present were all veterans of the Shanghai football scene, and their individual skills need no introduction.</p>
<p>Performance Skills... Each Has Its Own Merits...</p>
<p>In terms of the situation, the white team suffered a lot because the goalkeeper was injured after entering the field. With Kang Pudan guarding the goal and only four forwards left, the mixed colors team naturally had the upper hand. It also showed that the white team's defense was tight. Speaking of the entire team, the white team's skills and coordination were previously above the mixed colors team. Hubate's goalkeeping was calm and satisfactory. Taolewei's defense ran all over the field and cooperated well with Tuina. Xudeshituke was not as good in comparison. The center back lines of both sides were excellent and the most satisfactory. In the first twenty minutes of the game, Gaxu was full of energy and imposing, but gradually declined later. Smith's strength was that he could run and run consistently. Remidikao Sitai, the left and right pillars, were prominent among the forwards. Zhong Yongshen stood out, running like the wind. His many wonderful crosses were praised by the entire field. Jia Qiu's ball skills were good, and A Qiao worked very hard as usual. Wei Gensen and Hua Te both showed weakness. Peite was strong and agile. Sun Jinshun was mediocre and unable to stand out. Mao Lin and Kang Pudan's center forwards were hard to distinguish, and center forward talents still need to be considered.</p>
<p>White Team at a Disadvantage</p>
<h3>...Goal Loss and Injury...</h3>
<p>Referee Le Xiurong blew the whistle to gather. The white team attacked first. Gaxu, the center back of the mixed colors team, directed the left and right, sending the ball forward like a cannonball. The white team was busy coping under its fierce attack. Jiemeihuate flew many wonderful balls to the center. Sun Jinshun got a high pass from Hui Si Niao and fiercely carried the ball deep. Taolewei could not turn around in time, and there was no one in the back defense. He could have scored immediately, but Sun's leg hit Fu Lu Shou's body and was saved by Tuina. Zhong Yongshen's counterattack was ineffective. Hua Te returned the favor and shot diagonally from thirty yards away. Fu Lu Shou was anxious to save the ball and collided with Peida, falling to the ground. Although the ball was out of danger, Fu Lu Shou was bleeding and left the field injured.</p>
<p>Mixed Colors Team Exerts Power</p>
<h3>Two Goals in a Row</h3>
<p>The white team first lost a general, an ominous sign. Center forward Kang Pudan was transferred back to guard the old camp. Hu Sheng's feet were hard, and crises were everywhere. In the midst of the raging waves, Zhong Yongshen was still able to maintain his heroic qualities, constantly posing a major threat to the opponent. The mixed colors team had an opportunity to take advantage of. Hui Sihe started a war in the middle, Peite carried the ball to the low line and swept across. Kang Pudan jumped up and used his body. Although he touched the ball, it was too strong and slipped out of his hand. Jin Bo headed it in. The white team immediately ordered a counterattack. Xiao Zhong carried the ball and passed three levels in a row, passing to Chen Jiaqiu in the center. He waited and shot, hitting Xu De's body, avoiding a major disaster. Before long, Zhong also arrived at the opponent's abdomen, and passed to the middle. A Qiao missed the ball, and the audience sighed. Not long after, Xiao Zhong made two excellent crosses, both of which were lightly lost by A Qiao. Hua Te Zhang Yue on the frontier, Taolewei, the wise man, eventually passed the ball across to his own goal. Tuina did not kick it far, and Gaxu seized the opportunity and attacked the goal. Kang Pudan fell to the ground to save the ball, but could not prevent Peida from pushing it in, and it slowly rolled into the goal, making it 2-0.</p>
<p>Change Strategy</p>
<h3>...Jia Qiu Heads In...</h3>
<p>The white team lost two goals in a row, which was unexpected by most people. With only four forwards to fight, the offensive power was somewhat inferior. Under this heavy pressure, they used a surprise attack strategy, changing to long ball delivery. Zhong Yongshen responded on the right corner, forcing the mixed team to transfer their forces to defend the rear. The mixed colors team's arrogance was still not slightly reduced. Sun Pushun and Jin Bo echoed each other from east to west. Kang Pudan abandoned the goal and ran out, and Jin Bo shot at the empty goal. Fortunately, Taolewei quickly slid past and headed it into a corner kick, avoiding a disaster. There were still five minutes left in the first half. Wei Gensen carried the ball straight in, and turned around and handed it to A Qiao. A Qiao sent it to the right corner. Zhong Yongshen flew away, and kicked the goal, hitting the post and bouncing back. Jia Qiu jumped up and headed it in, sending it inside. The first half ended with a score of 2-1, with the mixed colors team taking the lead.</p>
<p>Endless Changes</p>
<h3>...Draw at the End...</h3>
<p>The viewers could not bear to see the white team's suffering, and shouted for someone to be added. Qiong Si was transferred in to fill the goalkeeper position, and Kang Pudan returned to the center forward position. The white team was full of life. Wei Gensen and A Qiao both used diagonal long balls to break through the opponent's defense line. Jia Qiu was behind, sending a ball to the left corner, Wei Gensen returned it to the center, Kang Pudan jumped up and headed it in, Hubate was knocked to the ground, Zhong Yongshen took the opportunity to gently push it in, and it became a 2-2 tie. The autumn colors were evenly divided, and each team defended its position, holding each other back. A Qiao could not run due to a foot injury, and each team was about to end the game with a score of two. Unexpectedly, in the last ten minutes, each team scored another goal. Peite, the right wing of the mixed colors team, got the ball and rushed like a galloping horse. Smith's two passes were lost, and Tuina could not stop him again. The ball entered the middle, Mao Lin advanced a few steps and kicked it in, and the mixed colors team took the lead again. The white team tried to cheer up. In the last five minutes, Wei Gensen was blocked by Xu De at the baseline, and immediately passed it to Xing A Qiao, and Stuke came to intercept it into a corner kick. Wei Gensen kicked the ball, which happened to land in front of the post. Hubate was stunned, and the ball was sent into the goal by the wind, ending the game with a 3-3 tie.</p>

<p>East China's Abandonment Problem</p>
<h3>The Team Declares its Difficulties, Hoping to Strive for Improvement</h3>
<p>East China's important Group A match against Fachang on Saturday, where East China announced its withdrawal before the match, aroused special attention in the football world. The details have already been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The East China Sports Association yesterday issued a statement, explaining the reasons for the withdrawal. The original text is copied below:</p>
<p>East China Statement</p>
<p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding our association's temporary absence from the Group A match against Fachang of the Western Union the other day, although the reasons for this are slightly recorded in major newspapers, our association still has to solemnly declare that one reason for our association's absence was that player Li Ning was unjustifiably punished and suspended for two weeks, and the second reason was that Wan Xianghua and the main substitute players traveled north with the Jiaotong University team. In addition, one or two players were either injured or sick. Therefore, we had no choice but to send another letter to the Western Union last Monday to explain the situation and request a postponement. Unexpectedly, the Western Union replied without sincere consideration, stubbornly refusing the request and strictly ordering us to comply with the league's order. This put our association in a dilemma, and we were willing to abandon the game, which was important for winning the championship. Therefore, before 2 pm yesterday, we were still running around and appealing everywhere, hoping to form an army to prepare for the final. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned, and it was impossible to gather the team. Therefore, at the last moment, we could only announce our absence. Furthermore, our association must state that the Western Union has always been responsive to requests for postponement from other parties, but has never approved our association's request once. This is something our association cannot understand. As for football news, we have always relied on the publicity of various newspapers, without any distinction between Chinese and Western. This absence was never discussed with any party in advance, and it was only a sudden occurrence that caused various ladies and gentlemen who cared about football to make unnecessary trips. Our association is deeply sorry and hopes for your understanding. We specially send this note to wish you well.</p>
<p>East China Sports Association, February 4th.</p>
<h3>Urgent Need for Reorganization</h3>
<p>Regarding the "dilemma of having to withdraw, not reporting the inquiry from Chinese newspaper reporters the night before, but only announcing it in the Western newspapers, which led to accusations from many parties and made the matter more serious, the association's lack of thoroughness in handling affairs is truly unsatisfactory. With East China's current position, the lack of leadership talent to preside over the association's affairs is a pity. The reason for yesterday's incident also lies in this. If the Hong Kong South China Athletic Association can be the most perfect group in the country, it is because of its perfect organization and thorough handling of affairs. East China is the most reputable football group in Shanghai, so it is urgent to seek a thorough improvement plan. Then, future success may not be created by today's predicament.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Withdrawal</h3>
<p>After East China's withdrawal, the selected players also did not appear in yesterday's second trial match of the Inter-Port team. The reason for this is unknown. According to unofficial rumors, East China will withdraw from the Western Union. Those who heard this were all saddened and disappointed. Since its establishment, East China has been around for three years, with remarkable achievements and the support of the masses. Unexpectedly, a sudden change occurred in the middle of the journey. However, what we hope for from East China is not the question of whether or not to withdraw from the Western Union, but how to improve the internal affairs of East China in the future.</p>

<p>Japanese Players Attending the Davis Cup</p>
<p>Adding New Players Such as Nishimura</p>
<p>Ambitious to Win the Championship</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency 4th Electric (Telegraphic)) The contrast in the 1934 Davis Cup Tennis Competition has already been announced. Japanese players have also added new players such as Hideo Nishimura, Jiro Yamagishi, and Saburo Fujikura, as an excellent opportunity to win this Davis Cup. This is Japan's first encounter with the Australian group, with Crawford, the number one player in the world, as Japan's biggest obstacle. If they can win, there is even hope of winning in the European zone, and then competing with the United States in the final. Therefore, if this obstacle can be overcome, it is not difficult for the Davis Cup to be brought from England to Japan.</p>

<p>The Question of China's Participation in the Far Eastern Games</p>
<h3>Sports Association to Hold Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Wang Rutang Has Had Preliminary Discussions with Finance Minister Kong Regarding Funding</p>
<p>Government Representatives are Expected to be Wang Rutang, Shen Siliang, and Hao Gengsheng</p>
<p>Preliminary Selection is Scheduled to Take Place in Shanghai Around Mid-April</p>
<p>The Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education held a meeting in late last month to discuss participation in the Far Eastern Games. According to Shen Guanliang's report, the Far Eastern Games will be held in Manila, Little Luzon, from May 12th to 19th, featuring nine championships and five demonstration events. China intends to participate in all the championships, with a delegation of 125 to 150 athletes, and a budget of 90,000 yuan. The participating countries are China, Japan, the Philippines, and India. The selection method for athletes is currently being drafted. The Association has decided to invite Wang Zhengting as the head representative, and the government should send a delegation of three representatives. Following the report, Wang Rutang has had substantial discussions with Finance Minister Kong regarding the appropriation of funds. It is understood that this matter should be handled independently by social organizations. It is also reported that the board of directors of the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association (whose nine directors are Wang Zhengting, Zhang Boqin, Chu Minyi, Hao Gengsheng, Wu Yuerui, Yuan Dunli, Shen Siliang, John Ma, and Ms. Gao Zi) will hold a meeting in Shanghai at the end of this month to discuss implementation methods. During the previous Sports Committee meeting, a committee member reported that, in light of foreign relations and for the sake of prudence, individuals with appropriate academic qualifications and standing should be selected for this Far Eastern Games, and their opinions should be valued. According to inquiries from various parties, the three government representatives likely to be sent by the Chinese government will be Wang Rutang, Shen Siliang, and Hao Gengsheng.</p>
<p>(Another Report) The quota for athletes participating in the 10th Far Eastern Games has been determined. The winners of the National Games will be used as the standard. Those who win first place in any sport at the National Games will be qualified to participate in the preliminary selection. Amateur athletes who believe their performance in a particular sport is close to the National Games record must register with the preliminary selection committee to participate in the preliminary selection. The preliminary selection method is still being drafted by the National Sports Association and the Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education. The preliminary selection is expected to be held in Shanghai in April.</p>

<h3>Talking About Gonococci</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanggao</p>
<p>Gonococcus is a type of coccus, a diplococcus to be exact. Bacteria can be broadly divided into three types: cocci, bacilli, and spirilla. The distinction between these three types is based entirely on their shapes. Gonococcus is a coccus, and because its arrangement is in pairs, it is also called diplococcus. Although it is a coccus, its true shape is not perfectly round but rather flat, so its actual shape is like a "coffee bean," with two "coffee beans" connected together. This is the shape we see under a microscope.</p>
<p>Gonococcus is a type of parasitic bacterium that adheres to mucous membranes. It invades the human body through the mucous membranes. If a person's mucous membrane has a wound, then the gonococcus gets a good opportunity. After invading, it shows its effects. It seeps harmful substances from its bacterial body into human cells. The cells are poisoned by it, and the body's reserve of white blood cells, as if they have received a mobilization order, advance directly to the site of the poison gathering, surrounding the injured area on all sides. In the center where the bacteria are located, the white blood cells directly engage them in combat. The result is death and injury on both sides. What is visible to the naked eye is the white, turbid discharge, which is pus. Pus is the product of the struggle.</p>
<p>This gonococcus, first discovered by Neisser, can invade the heart and meninges in addition to causing gonorrhea. This can lead to endocarditis and meningitis. Sometimes it can enter the joints from the urinary mucosa via the bloodstream, causing gonococcal monoarthritis. (It is called monoarthritis because gonococcal arthritis is mostly limited to one joint, unlike other common arthritis, which often inflames multiple joints simultaneously.) Gonorrhea on the conjunctiva is particularly virulent, and those affected often become blind. Therefore, the author takes this opportunity to warn gonorrhea patients to remember to disinfect their hands after touching the gonorrheal discharge, to avoid accidentally infecting their eyes with the gonococcus. Disinfection is actually a very simple matter, simply washing your hands with hot water and soap. It would be even better if you could add some disinfectant such as creosol to the water. However, it is not necessary, because gonococci die quickly in ordinary air and on objects, especially when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Speaking of gonorrheal eye disease reminds me that newborn babies delivered by modern methods must have a drop of eye medicine that kills gonococci put into their eyes as soon as they are born. This method was invented by Credé. From his experience, he knew that mothers with gonorrhea are most likely to infect their children with gonococci. Because infants' tissues have weak resistance, getting this bacterium almost always leads to blindness. The danger need not be said. Therefore, since he invented this compassionate method, I don't know how many disabled people have been saved invisibly, so I can't help but promote it.</p>
<p>After gonococcus invades human tissue, it does not immediately cause gonorrhea. There is a certain "incubation period" in between. This incubation period is two or three days (i.e., symptoms appear two or three days after infection). If the pus discharged at that time is examined under a microscope, many gonococci shaped like coffee beans can be seen, swallowed by white blood cells in their abdomens. The reason why these white blood cells (the standing army of the body) can engulf gonococci is that the gonococcus body has a substance similar to flavoring, which makes those white blood cells have a big appetite. However, this so-called eating bacteria effect is limited to acute gonorrhea. Once it becomes chronic, those white blood cells no longer eat them. Under the microscope, we can only see gonococci scattered around the white blood cells, but not entering their abdomens. This is also a strange event.</p>
<p>The detection of gonococci is a very easy event. We can also use artificial methods to culture this bacterium, but the culture procedure is more difficult than propagation. Because gonococci are not easy to grow obediently on artificial culture media. For those of us who are skilled, we don't find it so difficult to make them develop and multiply.</p>
<p>The abdomen of gonococcus contains a so-called endotoxin, Endotoxin. This toxin is indeed the most poisonous bacterial substance, and its resistance to heat is also very strong, so it cannot be eliminated even at a temperature of 70 degrees (Celsius), which shows how fierce its power is.</p>
<h3>Hazards, Elimination, and Prevention of Human Intestinal Parasites (4)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Benyi</p>
<p>(Lecture Manuscript at Cihang Midwifery School and Asian Middle School)</p>
<p>The routes of transmission of intestinal parasites are none other than our mouths and skin. To put it plainly, intestinal parasites enter from our mouths or skin. So, if we pay attention to hygiene, do not eat intestinal parasite eggs or larvae, or do not give intestinal parasite larvae a chance to contact our skin, then intestinal parasites, no matter how fierce, will only have to sigh that they have no place to use their heroism. From this point of view, although intestinal parasitic diseases are so common and so dangerous, as long as we work hard to prevent them, we can certainly avoid them. Now I will write down the simple preventive methods below.</p>
<p>1.  Do not eat raw vegetables.</p>
<p>Chinese people use feces to irrigate fields, and feces are the main camp of intestinal parasite eggs, so eating raw vegetables is very dangerous. According to Professor Tao Chih-sun, once he used one hundred cubic centimeters of water to wash three vegetable leaves; then he precipitated the water that had washed the vegetable leaves, and found more than fifty roundworm eggs. So not eating raw vegetables is a necessary condition for preventing intestinal parasitic diseases.</p>
<p>2.  Do not eat raw water chestnuts.</p>
<p>Raw water chestnuts are the vector of Fasciolopsis buski. The prevalence of Fasciolopsis buski in Xiaoshan is mostly due to eating raw water chestnuts, so they cannot be eaten.</p>
<p>3.  Do not eat undercooked meat and fish.</p>
<p>Meat and fish often become intermediate hosts of tapeworms, so they must be cooked thoroughly before eating, otherwise it is very dangerous.</p>
<p>4.  Do not drink unboiled water and do not eat unwashed fruit.</p>
<p>5.  Wash hands before and after eating.</p>
<p>Hands are very easy to come into contact with intestinal parasite eggs and larvae. Professor Tao Chih-sun once found two roundworm eggs on a nanny's fingernail, so we must wash our hands before eating.</p>
<p>6.  The feces of patients with intestinal parasites should be disinfected.</p>
<p>7.  Do not come into contact with the feces of patients with intestinal parasitic diseases.</p>
<p>8.  It is best to avoid going barefoot when farming and picking mulberry leaves.</p>
<p>Duodenal hookworm disease is relatively more common among farmers.</p>
<p>The so-called "mulberry leaf yellow" that is popular in the countryside is anemia caused by duodenal hookworm larvae burrowing into the skin of mulberry pickers. Therefore, to the extent possible, farmers should try to avoid farming and picking mulberry leaves barefoot.</p>

<p>Dogs and cats often also become intermediate hosts of tapeworms, so do not approach them.</p>

<p>(V) Final words.</p>
<p>This thing has been lectured at Cihang Midwifery School and Asian Middle School. There is no need to publish things that have been lectured, but because our compatriots are too indifferent to intestinal parasitic diseases. Some people even think that roundworms are digestive worms, and that things eaten cannot be digested without them. This is really a big joke! Therefore, I do not hesitate to publish this lecture manuscript, with some slight modifications, and change the title, borrowing the Shenbao Medical Weekly. If the reader gains knowledge of intestinal parasitic diseases from this, and no longer says inexplicable strange words; and even further implements the elimination and prevention of intestinal parasites, then I will be very fortunate!</p>
<p>Now I have listed the results of the examination of intestinal parasite eggs in the feces of some students from Cihang Midwifery School and Asian Middle School below for reference.</p>

<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(II) (10) (4) Tuberculosis</p>
<p>(Q) Can tuberculosis be completely cured?</p>
<p>(A) Early tuberculosis can probably be hoped to have a therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the principle of treating tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(A) The treatment of tuberculosis lies in enabling the patient's body to overcome the disease, so it is most important to protect the body and spirit and provide more nutrients. We now mostly use air, bed rest, light therapy, and drug therapy as well as physical therapy together.</p>
<p>(Q) What is air therapy?</p>
<p>(A) It is to make the patient live in fresh air. If there is no wind, the windows can be kept open. Patients who do not have a fever can be allowed to walk around.</p>
<p>(Q) What is bed rest therapy?</p>
<p>(A) Patients with fever must have absolute bed rest. This bed rest therapy is most suitable for chronic patients with mild fever or early-stage patients.</p>
<p>(Q) What is sunlight therapy?</p>
<p>(A) Sunlight is very effective for tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In mountainous and dry places, patients should be exposed to sunlight for one or two hours a day, with their faces covered with black cloth, which will be effective over time. But it is not suitable for cloudy and windy mountains.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there a definite effect of drug therapy for tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(A) Although there are many kinds of drug therapy for tuberculosis, there is no effective drug that has been discovered, so there is no definite effect to speak of. Commonly used are wood creosote agents, like creosote, but they can only reduce sputum and promote digestion; in addition, arsenic or phosphorus agents are used to increase the patient's physical strength. Ordinary drug therapy is mostly symptomatic, that is, giving separate medications for fever, cough, sputum, night sweats, hemoptysis, chest pain, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, loss of appetite, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) What kind of drugs should be used for the treatment of fever?</p>
<p>(A) There are only a few antipyretics, such as phenacetin, pyramidon, cligine, and aerbon. Among them, aerbon is the most effective.</p>
<p>(Q) What medicine is used for cough?</p>
<p>(A) If the patient's cough is very severe, even feeling pain or interfering with sleep, codeine phosphate and other anesthetics can be used to suppress the cough.</p>
<p>(Q) What medicine should be used for phlegm?</p>
<p>(A) When the phlegm is thick and difficult to cough up, expectorants such as senega root tincture, ipecac tincture, anise essence, and turpentine can be given.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the symptomatic treatment for night sweats?</p>
<p>(A) Drink a little brandy before going to bed, added to milk or tea. Or perform cold water friction, warm bath, or apply alcohol solution to the skin. Anti-perspirants such as camphoric acid, hyoscyamus extract, agaricin, or various hypnotics are all effective. If it is a stubborn cough, intravenous injection of hypertonic saline and calcium chloride solution can be performed for several consecutive days. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>New Interpretations and Corrections of Old Medicine</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Since sunlight can be analyzed, it naturally has various special effects. However, the light rays that reach the ground are subject to complex atmospheric conditions. During their passage, they may be refracted, and some or several parts may be absorbed. In particular, the ultraviolet rays that we focus on may or may not reach the ground. What we hope to obtain on the ground is this ray. Although it is exposed to sunlight, it may not be available. Then the purpose of sunlight therapy cannot be achieved, and the value of so-called sunbathing therapy loses its function and becomes zero.</p>
<p>The purpose of sunbathing for tuberculosis is to treat the disease. The light ray required for treatment is ultraviolet light. All other light rays contained in sunlight, although necessary for physiology, are not the objects of our goal. Therefore, we must ensure that our requirement for ultraviolet light is satisfied and pay special attention. Hence the saying of sunbathing for treatment in the mountains. Mountain sun is not originally different from flat ground. However, the air layer through which it passes contains fewer substances that hinder the light rays. Then the original nine kinds of light rays can be fully preserved. Ultraviolet light is of course one of them. Therefore, we can achieve our goal of treating tuberculosis. The reason why sunlight on flat ground, especially in cities, is less effective is none other than this. Ultraviolet light has the ability to kill bacteria. The reason why sunlight can disinfect is due to this. The purpose of sunbathing for tuberculosis patients is also focused on this. Therefore, preserving ultraviolet light is the goal of sunbathing. Now, the sunlight in flat cities is mixed with dust, soot, and various gaseous substances produced by ground animals in the air. Therefore, when sunlight passes through, most of the ultraviolet rays are refracted and absorbed by them. If it is refracted through glass again, the effect of this ray completely disappears. Therefore, modern physicians and physical therapy experts have confirmed that sunlight passing through glass no longer has the function of ultraviolet light. That is why artificial sun lamps do not use glass bulbs but replace them with quartz. Mr. Chen only knows that sunbathing can cure tuberculosis, but he does not know how it can cure tuberculosis. In his Tuberculosis Overview, he stated, "The mountains are most suitable. The distance from the ground is far, and the intensity of the light rays is not slightly damaged... If it is above the ground, the water vapor on the ground not only refracts the light strongly, but also has a certain light ray that is absorbed and transformed into nothing. The intensity of the light rays is reduced, and its disinfecting power is also reduced with it..." It seems that he understands that sunlight contains ultraviolet light and that ultraviolet light can kill bacteria and disinfect. But he suddenly showed off his cleverness in the discussion, adding something superfluous and inserting his own views. He added, "When performing this technique, it is best to avoid the wind. It would be best to hold it in a glass room." He was unaware that glass can also absorb ultraviolet light and cause it to disappear. (New recent research in the United States has found a type of glass that is said not to hinder the transmission of ultraviolet light, but I have not seen it yet.) This is a loss due to the lack of scientific foundation. I deeply hope that Mr. Chen will refer to the article "Notes on the Treatment of Tuberculosis with Ultraviolet Light" in the 5th issue of the 5th volume of the Diagnosis and Treatment Medical Report, drafted by yours truly. He should be able to understand the general outline. I also hope that Mr. Chen will not mix in previously imagined fallacies outside of scientific experimental writing in the future when writing, so as to cause the entire text to be self-contradictory, then I will be very fortunate. Confucius said, "A hypocrite is the thief of virtue." I am willing to encourage Mr. Chen with this.</p>
<h3>Lung Tuberculosis Prevention Medicine and its Inventor, Calmette (2) (Translated by Havas News Agency from the October 14, 1933 issue of Parisian Illustrated Weekly)</h3>
<p>In addition, there have been scientists from France and other countries who have conducted similar or vastly different research.  According to what is considered most fashionable in medical circles in a certain small area, it is Friedman's research. This person proposed a type of vaccine in 1903, called "turtle bacteria."  As for its effectiveness, after repeated trials on guinea pigs, it was deemed ineffective by Dr. Saenz, an assistant of Dr. Calmette and director of the Pasteur Institute's laboratory.  Among the aforementioned research, the most famous should be that of R. Koch, the actual inventor of the tuberculosis bacillus (this term should be interpreted according to the original Latin meaning), who sought to find a cure.  Koch's tuberculin injection (Tuberculine) did not undergo a transplanting procedure on animals like preparing serum. Instead, it directly injected a toxin derived from the tuberculosis bacillus into the human body to induce a suitable "anti-toxic constitution."  Subsequent experiments proved it to be dangerous. However, when the injection liquid is diluted to an extremely weak concentration, it can usually be used to test whether there are disease roots in the human body. Before children over the age of two or adults are injected with BCG, the above test must first be performed.  To ensure the effectiveness of the preventive injection, it must first be verified that there are two negative reactions within an eight-day interval. Technically, the method of administration is the same as vaccination. First, use a multi-pointed lancet to puncture the skin twice on the back below the shoulder in the deltoid region (without causing bleeding), one above and one below. The first puncture, called the control point, is not treated with the bacterial solution. The second puncture is treated with a drop of bacterial solution, which is gently spread. Two days later, if the vaccinated person's body does contain the bacteria, a positive reaction will occur, appearing as a swollen, red patch with a diameter of 1 to 3 millimeters, and a purple-red vesicle in the center that can last for four to six days. If the body does not contain the bacteria, the skin color will be the same as the control point. This skin reaction (as it is called) is most important. A positive result does not immediately indicate that the person has tuberculosis, but only proves that the body contains some harmful bacteria, which often cannot cause harm, thus becoming a natural form of prevention. Since 1927, the use of tuberculosis prevention medicine has become increasingly important in France and other countries. In 1924, only 850 children in France received the injection. In 1932, the number was 124,737, and in the first seven months of 1933, it was 87,044. In this struggle, the Nord department of France alone accounted for 9,895 injections in 1932, ranking first. Now, globally, there is no civilized country that does not have at least one center for producing prevention medicine, and some even have several, such as Berlin, Langenderbach, and Breslau in Germany, Leningrad, Moscow, and Kharkov in Russia, and Milan and Bologna in Italy. As for mainland France, there is only one in Paris, but in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, AOF, AEF, Madagascar, Vietnam, Martinique</p>
<p>and other places, they all have their own pharmaceutical production sites. There is a reason for this: to preserve the efficacy of the prevention medicine, it must be used within ten days of its production, so it cannot be delivered from afar, stored for long periods, or sold as a commodity. All the prevention medicine used throughout France is obtained from the research institute in Paris. All those used for injecting newborn infants are distributed free of charge by the institute. Doctors or midwives throughout the country are given to only medical doctors for other people's usage. The institute never supplies prevention medicine for foreign use, but only sends the Colmette-Guerin bacterial culture to similar laboratories. Therefore, the preparation of this preventive medicine is the responsibility of the research institutes in each location. It is because of this that the Lubec incident occurred in the history of tuberculosis injection therapy, which almost completely discredited the BCG prevention medicine. In early 1930, it was suddenly reported that 200 infants in the city who had received the injection had contracted acute tuberculosis, and as many as 76 of them died within a few days. After strict investigation by the German judicial and health authorities, it was found that the tragedy was caused by the German doctor responsible for preparing the preventive medicine. Due to negligence, this doctor mistakenly mixed the virulent bacteria sent from Kiel and cultured in the same laboratory into the BCG vaccine. At that time, the French side immediately suspected that there must be a mistake. This point was also acknowledged by German officials and scientists.</p>
<p>Since 1927, the Grace BCG Prevention Medicine has Bestowed Upon Us</p>
<p>In practice, BCG preventive medicine is indeed harmless. Hundreds of thousands of tests have proven its absolute harmlessness. Some writers have previously made unfounded speculations that the BCG vaccine may one day become toxic and cause tuberculosis, but over time, these speculations have been proven incorrect. Moreover, Dr. Weill-Hallé, who initially used tuberculosis prevention medicine with Drs. Calmette and Guerin, published a well-supported paper in the weekly journal of the Academy of Medicine. Its conclusion stated that concerning BCG prevention medicine, we and William Fark have repeatedly stated that the risk of it degenerating or disappearing in the human body is high, while the risk of it regaining its original virulence is low. Therefore, it is necessary to check periodically whether the preventive power still exists. If it has disappeared, it must be re-injected. In practice, all children are re-injected at the ages of one and three, and then again at the ages of seven and fifteen. But some people ask whether BCG prevention medicine is effective. Many years have given us the answer. Regarding this question, the Weekly Journal of Pulmonology and the annual publication of the Pasteur Institute have published comments from medical experts for several months, all stating that the number of deaths among children who have been injected is significantly reduced compared to those who have not been injected. Furthermore, the trial conducted by Dr. Quiran</p>
<p>alde Essarts in the Finistère department is the most complete and interesting. The province is particularly unfortunate, with an excessive number of residents suffering from tuberculosis. The site where the doctor conducted the trial was the port of Brest, which is particularly susceptible to the virus and serves as a focal point for sailors. The children examined by the doctor (regardless of whether they had been injected) all lived in families with one or more tuberculosis patients. The overall results of the doctor's experience from 1927 to 1932 are listed below (excluding stillbirths and children who died within one day to one month after birth, as the injection medicine had not yet taken effect).</p>
<p>In 1927, a total of 186 children were examined from 75 families. 75 were injected at birth, and 111 were not injected. Among those who died from one to five years of age, one had been injected, or 1.33%. 26 had not been injected, or 23.42%. (The injected child died of diphtheria.)</p>
<p>In 1928, a total of 336 children were examined from 132 families. Among them, 137 had been injected or re-injected, and 199 had not been injected. Among those who died from one month to four years after birth, 11 had been injected, or 8.02%. 39 had not been injected, or 19.59%. The causes of death for those who had been injected were as follows: 2 died in accidents, 1 died of gastrointestinal disease, 2 died of meningitis, 2 died of pertussis, 1 died of measles, 2 died of tracheobronchitis, and 1 died of peritonitis.</p>
<p>In 1929, a total of 390 children were examined from 149 families. Among them, 176 had been injected or re-injected, and 214 had not been injected. Among those who died from one month to three years after birth, 14 had been injected, or 7.9%, and 44 had not been injected, or 20.56%. The causes of death for those who had been injected were as follows: 3 died of tracheobronchitis, 2 died in accidents, 3 died of meningitis, 1 died of dysentery, 1 died of pertussis, 3 died of enteritis, and 1 died of smallpox.</p>
<p>In 1930, a total of 413 children were examined from 165 families. Among them, 216 had been injected or re-injected, and 197 had not been injected. Among those who died from one month to two years after birth, 13 had been injected, or 6%, and 26 had not been injected, or 12.6%. The causes of death for those who had been injected were as follows: 4 died of tracheobronchitis, 3 died of enteritis, 1 died of dysentery, 2 died of measles, and 3 died of meningitis.</p>
<p>In 1931, a total of 516 children were examined from 199 families. Among them, 283 had been injected or re-injected, and 233 had not been injected. Among those who died from one month to one year after birth, 15 had been injected, or 5.3%, and 32 had not been injected, or 13.7%. The causes of death for those who had been injected were as follows: 3 died of meningitis, 2 died of measles, 2 died in accidents, 3 died of tracheobronchitis, 3 died of enteritis, and 2 died of pertussis.</p>
<p>I have deliberately published the details of this evidentiary investigation. There are hundreds of similar cases that can be published, and the evidence is even more conclusive. The above list relates to the special situation in the Brest area, so we should note that during this period, extremely acute pediatric epidemics occurred there, wreaking havoc. In practice, we can see that those who have been injected with BCG also have stronger resistance to various diseases other than tuberculosis than those who have not been injected.

<h3>The Son Who Came to Collect a Debt</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>A few days ago, when Mr. W's young child passed away in the hospital, I was also present. Watching Mrs. W's grief-stricken state, I and many others present could not think of a single word of comfort, and could only silently stand guard alongside the small corpse on the bed.</p>
<p>However, I thought in my heart, this is truly a son who came to collect a debt!</p>
<p>Poor people have a self-created philosophy, and their philosophical system is entirely based on their real lives and is extremely closely aligned with their real lives, thus directly explaining their real lives. For example, the concept of "the son who came to collect a debt" mentioned above is also included in their philosophy.</p>
<p>According to the sages, the relationship between father and son is one of the human relationships, so the father must be benevolent and the son must be filial. But the poor people do not understand this kind of reasoning. They only believe what they think, believing that "accumulating grain prevents famine, raising sons prevents old age." Because of "preventing old age," they "raise sons." Therefore, after raising a son, they certainly hope that he will be able to support his parents in the future. However, there are many sons who die prematurely, having been raised by their parents but not supporting them in return.</p>
<p>At this time, the parents are like businessmen who have lost their capital, feeling a great loss. But at this time, their philosophy comes in handy; this is because they owed a debt in their previous life! The dead child is not a son, but a debt collector sent by the underworld. Now that the debt has been cleared, he has returned.</p>
<p>In this way, they can even calculate a number: the total amount of money spent on this child from the time their wife became pregnant until the child's death is the amount of debt they owed in their previous life.</p>
<p>But poor people are poor after all, so they only care about money and not about spirit. If it were other people, they would care about spirit and not about money.</p>
<p>What made me think of Mrs. W's son as "collecting a debt" upon seeing her state was the excessive expenditure on her son's spiritual aspect.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes to raise good children, but there are many ways to be good. The so-called good children of wealthy families are nothing more than "like orchids and jade trees, wanting them to grow in the courtyard," but in the eyes of poor people, such children are not good children, but the fiercest debt collectors. They are not collecting debts from their parents, but from the majority of the poor. Only the children of the poor, if they do not die prematurely, will certainly be able to repay their debts. Not only will they be able to repay the debts they owe to their parents, but they will also repay a lot to the entire society, especially to the rich. However, they actually do not owe debts to the rich. If one must say they owe debts, it can only be said to be a matter of a previous life.</p>
<h3>Tao Yuanming's Era Personality and Poetry</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Guyun</p>
<p>Like Mr. Guyun, I am a lover of Tao's poetry, and his solitary appreciation of himself touches us even more, easily attracting us to become "Tao's party." But even though his personality is "great" and his poetry is "faint and natural," we should not "pander to his preferences" by saying that he is "a farmer who can write poetry."</p>
<p>After the Eastern Jin Dynasty, wars broke out one after another, and the alleys and lanes were desolate. Sou Jun said, "Yanling used to have fifty to sixty thousand households, but now there are only a few hundred." The area was sparsely populated. The superiors "abolished the system of encouraging cultivation in the spring and strictly established the order of rent in the winter, but the subordinates have not seen it implemented, only asking for taxes." As a result, "tens of thousands of husbands did not cultivate the land." (Wen Qiao's words) In addition, "wealthy families mostly occupied public land, renting it out at high prices to the poor." As a result, "the rich have more than enough grain for their dogs and horses;...the poor are not satisfied with chaff and bran." This was the era in which Tao Yuanming lived. If Tao Yuanming was really a "farmer" who could write poetry, his works would not completely ignore the shadows of the countryside. Du Fu and Li Bai both suffered from the Tianbao Rebellion. Tragic scenes of chaos can be found in Du Fu's poems, but not in Li Bai's poems at all. Tao's poems on the countryside are like Li's poems on the war. They did not deeply understand it. Reading Tao's poems, I always feel that every plant and tree is approachable; the barking of dogs and the crowing of chickens are fascinating. The so-called "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains" is also true. His moving poems: ", words and laughter are never enough." His drinking poems: "Old friends appreciate my interest, jugs come together; sitting under the pine trees, we pour and drink until we are drunk. The old man speaks disorderly, and the order of the cups is lost; I don't feel that I exist, how can I know that things are valuable?" This is simply the life of people in Shangri-la. Why does he still dream of Shangri-la's fairyland? It can be seen that he escaped from reality and did not understand the countryside. A few years ago, Wuhan was flooded and hundreds of thousands of people were fish. Some people floated on boats in the moonlight, playing the flute with prostitutes, which was also quite poetic; but in the eyes of the victims, what kind of reaction would this melodious song cause! We were born thousands of years later and have nothing to do with Tao Yuanming's era of pain, so we feel that Tao's poems are all refreshing and pleasing to the eye. If you read the Book of Jin and the Book of Song carefully, you will definitely have a different kind of emotion. Most of the Eastern Jin literati escaped from reality, using Taoist and Buddhist thought as a place to escape; Tao Yuanming has his own "ivory palace," idle clouds and wild cranes. How dare we, the small farmers, try to climb up to him and join him?</p>
<h3>Internal War and Marriage Problems</h3>
<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>In recent years, many philanthropists in the country have been telegraphing and writing articles advocating the abolition of internal wars. This is not only a waste of effort, but it would also be a great pity if it could be done, because internal wars do have many benefits.</p>
<p>I think the biggest benefit of internal wars is that they can solve marriage problems! (This is such a tiring problem!) I don't know about others, but I have had several experiences myself... Whenever internal wars are in full swing, there are several times more weddings in the areas near the war zone than usual. When the internal war in a certain province was in full swing this time, in a certain city where I lived not far from the war zone, I saw flower-tied banners such as "So-and-so Wedding" and "So-and-so Family Welcoming the Bride" hanging at the entrances of grand hotels and luxurious inns every day. Every time I passed by these places, I couldn't help but feel... Internal wars have greatly benefited marriage!</p>
<p>The reason for the increase in marriages during internal wars is easy to understand. Originally, which parents in the world do not hope that their children will get married soon, but hope is just hope, and in fact there are many difficulties. Especially in this recession year, it is really not easy to marry someone. It goes without saying for the poor, but even the rich have their difficulties, because the more money they have, the bigger the show they want to put on. In ordinary times, matchmakers always have to run back and forth many times before a marriage can be successful; how many difficulties do they have to go through from engagement to marriage? Now, with the army at the gates of the city, it is important to escape, so who has the time to look for a matchmaker, so they have to get married "simply." In the eyes of the elderly, it is always safer for a married couple to escape than for a pair of unmarried young men and women to travel together; especially for parents who are choosing a son-in-law for their daughter, they feel that they have put down a stone in their hearts after marrying their daughter to a decent man.</p>
<p>From the children's point of view, this kind of external pressure also has its benefits. Although modern people verbally agree that love should not have conditions, marriage still has conditions. If a college student marries a middle school student, he will always feel a little condescending, especially for women. As for whether or not they have a car and whether or not they can dance, sometimes these also become prerequisites for marriage. Therefore, the result of love is not necessarily marriage, because there are too many obstacles to marriage. Now that disaster is imminent, all kinds of obstacles have disappeared invisibly. Not only are stubborn parents now giving in and no longer opposing free marriage, but young men and women have also undergone a new change in their psychology... Women are afraid of being raped by soldiers and quickly want to marry a husband; men, on the other hand, have planes circling overhead every day and bombs dropping like rain. Maybe one day they will hit themselves, but when they "confront" Yama, at least they will not be laughed at for being a man all their lives without ever having slept with a woman. So this is another reason for the increase in marriages.</p>
<p>From this point of view, internal wars are very meritorious to marriage, or in other words, they make a great contribution to the country. Because the basic condition for establishing a country is population. No insightful politician in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, does not agree to increase the population. The French government even spends a lot of money every year to encourage French people to have children. Increasing the population is by no means something that can be done by giving empty talk and writing articles; if everyone swears not to marry, how can the population increase? There are many ways to promote marriage, but internal war is indeed the best way to promote marriage, so I think it is a pity to abolish internal war.</p>
<h3>Liang Rengong in Hunan (2)</h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>During the Wuxu Reform Movement, Liang Rengong lectured in Hunan, causing a great uproar in the ideological circles, that is, a major conflict between the new and old factions. How did the old faction attack Mr. Liang that day?</p>
<p>Naturally, if you want to condemn someone, you can always find an excuse! In the eyes of the old faction, Liang Rengong was the culprit who corrupted the Hunan academic style and the demon of heresy. The preface to Su Yu's Yijiao Collection says</p>
<p>When Liang Qichao presided over the Shiwu Academy, he promoted his teacher's theory, and for a time, the ranks of the gentry disregarded their reputation and regarded him as a religious leader. His words were mainly based on Kang's New Studies of the Forged Classics and Confucius' Reform Examination, supplemented by the fallacies of equality, civil rights, and Confucius' chronology. Forging the Six Classics is to destroy the Holy Scriptures; entrusting reform is to disrupt the constitution; advocating equality is to corrupt the ethical code; extending civil rights is to have no monarch; Confucius' chronology is to make people unaware of the present dynasty.</p>
<p>This announces the five major crimes of Liang Rengong's lectures in Hunan. The Xiang Provincial Academic Covenant of the old faction also says;</p>
<p>Since Liang Qichao of Xinhui came to Hunan as the chief instructor of the academy, he greatly promoted his teacher Kang Youwei's heresy, bewitching the people of Hunan, and the ignorant followed him. At first, they echoed him, intending to follow the trend, but later they became deeply confused and their hearts changed suddenly. Examining his theories, he either revered Moses and advocated civil rights, or followed the Christian chronology and spoke of the Uncrowned King's reform. He said that combining species is to preserve species, that China is not China, and that there are such words as equality between the monarch and the people and that the monarch's rule is too long, as seen in the academy's comments, the society's lectures, and the Xiang News and Xiang Academic News, which are too numerous to mention. It seems that such betrayal of the monarch and father and slander of the classics is a great disaster in our school that allows monsters to run rampant under the bright sunlight?</p>
<p>Here, the old faction scolds Liang Rengong... "Monsters run rampant under the bright sunlight," which is really seeing ghosts in broad daylight! But at the time, they thought they were scolding him happily. Now, from these kinds of articles, we can still see the great influence of Liang Rengong's lectures in Hunan! As the students of Yuelu Academy, Bin Fengyang, etc., said in their letter to Dean Wang Yiwu...</p>
<p>I secretly believe that the folk customs of our province are simple and unadorned. Before last summer, it was a peaceful world. Since Huang Gongdu came to inspect, there has been talk of advocating civil rights; since the school envoy Xu Guanfu arrived, many people have revered Kang's learning; since Xiong Bingsan, the commoner, invited Liang Qichao to preside over the Shiwu Academy, as a disciple of Kang Youwei, he greatly promoted his teacher's theory, and his party was enlarged and his foundation was firm. The hearts of the people in our province suddenly changed. Dai Decheng, Fan Chui, Tang Caichang, Yi Nai, etc., inherited his style, recklessly inciting, and directly wanted to destroy the hearts of the Chinese people and overturn the ancient learning cases. From Hengyong in the north to Yuechang in the south, heresy was pervasive and the audience was confused. I do not understand what the intentions of Xiong, Tan, Dai, Fan, Tang, and Yi are, and they must want to subvert our country!</p>
<p>One said, "The hearts of the people in our province suddenly changed." The other said, "From Hengyong in the north to Yuechang in the south, heresy was pervasive and the audience was confused." The magical power of Liang Rengong's lectures was really not small! In fact, this new hero of the ideological circles at the time was created by the times. How could the old faction not know this? So Liang Dingfen said in his letter to Wang Jijiu;</p>
<p>The Treaty of Shimonoseki has been concluded for several years, and there has also been the incident in Jiaozhou. The barbarians are invading each other, and the villains are indulging themselves. Therefore, Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, who worship heresy, took the opportunity to stir up trouble and loudly advocated changing the religion.</p>
<p>Fairly speaking, at that time, the internal affairs and diplomacy of the Manchu Qing government were all wrong. What was the crime of Kang and Liang's advocating reform and renewal and reforming politics? Unfortunately, the old faction did not know it at the time, and when they did know it later, there was no way to do it, and the Manchu Qing Dynasty also perished!</p>
<h3>Nanny (3)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuanpeng</p>
<p>"No, Madam."</p>
<p>"Oh, you'd better change the little shirt and pants."</p>
<p>The madam's face was as solemn as a December morning.</p>
<p>"Yes, I just changed them today."</p>
<p>She answered in surprise, her face flushed to the roots of her ears. Heavens, her clothes were all tattered and old, with indelible stains and oil marks on the front. Even after washing, they still looked gray and dirty.</p>
<p>The madam's face showed a hint of disgust and contempt. She walked to her husband and questioned him, "How could you choose such a clumsy, dirty nanny?"</p>
<p>"Well, you know," her husband said, "these clumsy, country women, like cows, have particularly abundant milk... We just need her milk..."</p>
<p>"That's right." The madam didn't advocate hiring a beautiful nanny. She finally murmured, "It's just a bit too dirty... just..."</p>
<p>So the madam went to the nanny and said,</p>
<p>"I think your milk is very good, but there is a small problem, but it doesn't matter. You can stay here for a week and see how it goes."</p>
<p>The madam specially brought it up again to instruct her,</p>
<p>"If you feed the child well, you can stay in my house until the child grows up and no longer needs breast milk."</p>
<p>"That would be even better, Madam." She felt as if she had found a home.</p>
<p>"Will your husband agree?"</p>
<p>"My husband can't control me."</p>
<p>"Forget about your husband for now, and focus on raising my child." The madam said.</p>
<p>Her husband was the same age as her, and they had only been married for a year, but he couldn't support a child, so he sent him to a nursery. Occasionally thinking of her own man, there was nothing worth missing.</p>
<p>A week passed, and the nanny was not abandoned by the madam, but stayed.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>In the kitchen, she sat with the female cook, trying to find out about the madam's temper and the family's situation. "Did you hear the madam say anything about me?"</p>
<p>"The madam said you are too dirty."</p>
<p>"Didn't she say I was too ugly?"</p>
<p>"What's the big deal about being a little ugly? The previous nanny was really pretty, with a round face, a hundred times more beautiful than the madam herself.</p>
<p>Her clothes were also neat, and she looked like an intelligent person. I don't know why, but she didn't suit the madam's temperament, and she was dismissed after a week..."</p>
<p>So, she understood that her shortcoming was not in her appearance (the madam didn't need a beautiful nanny), but in those dirty, old, and unclean clothes. In this early summer weather, it didn't cost much to wear a new set of clothes. Putting on a set of white bamboo cloth shirt and pants made her a new person.</p>
<p>She borrowed money from the female cook in advance and made new clothes.</p>
<p>All her shortcomings seemed to be covered up by the new clothes. She combed her hair smoothly, often shaved her face, plucked her thick black eyebrows, and often worried about a drop of oil stain appearing on her new clothes.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>When the child came to the nanny's side, the thin, pointed face and cheeks gradually plumped up. The madam's relatives and friends came to her house to see the child, and compared to the previous days, everyone praised the nanny's ability to raise children. Only the madam herself never uttered a word of praise. The number of times the child cried at night while sleeping next to the nanny also decreased. Occasionally, if he cried once, the next day the madam would question her, "Why did you let the child cry last night?"</p>

<h3>The Significance of the US Lowering the Par Value</h3>
<p>— Zhao Chaogou</p>
<p>The so-called par value is the ratio of the components contained in the currencies of two countries. Lowering the par value means reducing the components contained in this currency. For example, the par value of the Japanese yen to the US dollar is 49.85 gold dollars per 100 yen. If the par value is reduced by one-half, the new par value will be slightly less than 25 gold dollars per 100 yen. Simply put, lowering the par value means reducing the gold value contained in the currency unit, thereby reducing the value of the currency.</p>
<p>The purpose of generally lowering the par value is twofold: one is to end domestic inflation and stabilize prices. After a country experiences inflation and prices have risen, its foreign exchange rate will inevitably fall. It is very difficult to restore the old par value. Instead, it is better to lower the old par value and stabilize the domestic and foreign purchasing power of the currency with the new par value. The second is exactly the opposite: to use lowering the par value as a means of inflating the currency. If the currency component is reduced by one-half, the country's reserves can be immediately doubled, and the amount of banknotes issued can also be doubled.</p>
<p>According to today's news (February 2, according to the US announcement, it was January 31), the US has officially lowered the par value to 59.06 cents, and the extent of the comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>Gold Dollar's Composition	Exchange Rate Reduction Ratio	Gold Buying Price Increase Rate	Gold Price Increase</p>
<p>Old Par Value	23.2		20.7</p>
<p>New Par Value	13.8	40	34.7	67</p>
<p>After the announcement of this news, everyone thought that the currency war would become more intense, but I think this observation may be an overestimation. In fact, it may be the prelude to the establishment of an exchange rate.</p>
<p>The United States' move to lower the par value this time is very unique. It wants to use this to reduce the risk of inflation and to restore prices. It can be said that it has both of the above-mentioned purposes. On the one hand, it is implementing the gold buying policy to lower the price of gold dollars, and at the same time stabilize the foreign exchange rate. Last year, there were rumors that the United States would lower the par value, but later it announced the gold buying policy. This time, it has turned to lowering the par value again. We can analyze the relationship between them based on the following facts:</p>
<p>(1) After the United States implemented the National Industrial Recovery Act, although it had a slight effect at first, the results were not as expected. On the one hand, the cost of producers increased, and at the same time, the public's purchasing power could not keep up with prices, so prices reversed after July. Roosevelt had to use the final means to lower the gold dollar, which was the gold buying policy. However, the result of the gold buying policy was not very satisfactory. I (missing text) Comparing the actual exchange rate between the UK and the US with the exchange rate calculated by the New York gold price, you can see the failure of the gold buying policy.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Calculated from Gold Price	Actual Exchange Rate</p>
<p>November 12	5.12	5.09</p>
<p>14	5.18	5.16</p>
<p>15	5.22	5.28</p>
<p>16	5.20	5.41</p>
<p>Before the 14th, the exchange rate calculated from the gold price was higher than the actual exchange rate, which is exactly because the New York gold buying price was higher than that of London, thus leading the exchange rate, which can be said to be the normal effect of the gold buying policy. But the situation changed after the 15th. The exchange rate was higher than the exchange rate calculated from the gold price, and the actual exchange rate changed outside of the gold price. The British and American exchange rate had fallen into speculative behavior, and the gold buying policy had lost its ability to control the gold dollar. The change of the gold dollar could not be stopped, and it had to be regarded as a failure of the gold buying policy. (2) Since the gold buying policy had failed and the domestic situation was deteriorating, the banks were unwilling to invest. Although General Johnson threatened and negotiated with the banking industry, the banking industry also strongly refused due to the instability of the gold dollar. The banking industry demanded that credit could not be provided unless the unsound monetary policy was abandoned. If this is the case, then the industrial recovery will inevitably stagnate. This also prompted Roosevelt to stabilize the gold dollar. (3) Roosevelt initially thought that lowering the gold dollar could raise prices, and never thought about stabilization. As a result, although the price of the gold dollar was lowered, capital escaped, foreign tariff retaliations, and the strength of the pound sterling were all detrimental to the United States. If this continues, once it leads to the breakdown of the gold standard group, the more countries participating in the currency war, the more the benefits of lowering the gold dollar will be sacrificed. Therefore, it is better to stabilize the gold dollar at a relatively low price and then negotiate the exchange rate with various countries. (4) In addition, there has always been a distinction between the expansionist faction and the sound money faction in the country. When the gold buying policy was announced, members of the sound money faction resigned and expressed their opposition. The tendency of domestic public opinion to oppose it gradually increased, and Roosevelt had to stop before it was too late.</p>
<p>Based on the above four points, I think that this time the United States lowering the par value is more like a guide to the establishment of an exchange rate than it will cause a more fierce currency war. As long as the United States is willing to stabilize the exchange rate, the UK will not be a problem. In fact, the United States would not dare to boldly lower the par value unless it had a considerable understanding with the United Kingdom in advance.</p>
<p>I am afraid that if the gold dollar is stabilized one day, the UK and Japan will have the risk of further lowering the exchange rate. If the UK and the US have a prior understanding, then the stability of the world exchange rate is possible. The United States holds a 2 billion yuan stabilization fund. Even if there is temporary competition between the UK and the US exchange rates, it is easy to correct it, or it may open up a new situation in the world's currency problem.</p>
<h3>Overview of Japanese Northern Pacific Fisheries</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch on January 31, at the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the same day, Aoki Seiichi of the Seiyukai Party suggested the issue of supporting the Northern Pacific fisheries. It roughly stated: "...But the expenses and methods for the Northern Pacific fisheries body should be placed under national control, and a Northern Pacific Fisheries Company should be established." Foreign Minister Hirota replied: "In order to counter the Soviet Union's state-run policy, a semi-official and semi-commercial company should be established to manage it." (See Shen Bao and Jiji Xinbao on February 1 for details.) The Northern Pacific fisheries issue often provokes disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union. Last year, there was an incident in which a Russian warship shelled a Japanese fishing boat. The Japanese have always been known for their greed and cunning. How can they tolerate this strong neighbor? It is only natural that they should not forget to seek countermeasures in their sleep and food. The purpose of this article is to briefly describe the evolution of the Northern Pacific fisheries, clarify its current situation, and further analyze the crux of the Northern Pacific fisheries issue.</p>
<p>(2) The Evolution of the Northern Pacific Fisheries</p>
<p>The Northern Pacific refers to the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the northern part of the Sea of Japan. The area is very wide, totaling 530,000 square nautical miles, which is four times larger than the famous North Sea international fishing ground in Northern Europe. Although the types of aquatic products are slightly less than those produced in the South Pacific, the quantity is more than sufficient. The products are mainly salmon, trout, herring, cod, halibut, flounder, crab, whale, and other marine animals. The transportation chain also extends to Europe and the United States, so the Northern Pacific fisheries are actually a global fishery. The developers are Japanese and Russian people. By the Meiji 8th year, in the Treaty of Exchange of the Kuril Islands, Russia occupied the southern part of Sakhalin, and the fisheries in the same area were also owned by the Russians. However, Japan was still allowed to operate in its territorial waters. However, Russia realized the benefits of Japanese fishery operations in Sakhalin, and took measures to exclude Japanese fisheries and promote domestic fisheries. Such as imposing heavy taxes, restricting fishing gear, fishing methods, and closing fishing grounds, Japanese fishermen were severely hit and most went bankrupt. It was not until the 35th year of Meiji that the Foreign Territorial Waters Fisheries Association Law was formulated, and the current Russian-owned Aquatic Products Association was established. In the 37th and 38th years of the Meiji era, in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan won and seized the fishing rights in the Russian Far East. In the 40th year, the Japan-Russia Fisheries Agreement was formally established, and the Japanese Northern Pacific fisheries advanced rapidly. Later, after the establishment of the Soviet government, the current Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty was concluded in Showa 3rd year (1928). The new treaty stipulates that the lease rights of most fishing grounds between the two countries will be extended to 1936, so it was temporarily able to survive.</p>
<p>Japanese fisheries started in the 26th year of Meiji. At that time, Captain Gunji and others developed the northern Kuril Islands and organized the Hokokugikai. In the 32nd year, they officially engaged in fishery in the Sea of Okhotsk. At the same time, there were Japanese fur seal hunting ships in the Northern Pacific. In the 10th year of Taisho, there were also factory ship crab fisheries. Mother ship type salmon trout fisheries arose in the Showa era. Fish meal factory ships and factory ships have only recently appeared.</p>
<p>The products of the Northern Pacific fisheries, such as salmon, trout, herring, and crab, amount to about 100,000 tons annually, with a value of 50 million yen. There are about 24,000 fishery workers, using more than 250 ships, weighing about 500,000 tons. The annual capital used for fisheries is as much as 20 million yen, and the property on the fishing grounds amounts to 40 million yen. Therefore, the Northern Pacific fisheries are an important part of the Japanese aquatic industry, and have a great relationship with population, food, labor, foreign trade, and shipping.</p>
<p>(3) The Current Situation of Japanese Northern Pacific Fisheries</p>
<p>The Japanese fisheries currently operating in the Northern Pacific can be divided into the following five types:</p>
<p>(1) Russian-owned fisheries: Russian-owned fisheries are based on the 1928 Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, and Japanese are allowed to operate in Soviet territorial waters. According to the contract, the fishing grounds are called fishing districts, which are leased with the consent of the governments of Japan and the Soviet Union. At present, the number of fishing districts leased by the Japanese has reached 350, and they pay more than 4 million yen in rent, taxes, and other expenses annually. Japanese drive fishing boats between April and May and August and September each year to catch salmon, trout, herring, and crabs using set nets or gill nets. The average annual catch is about 80,000 tons, worth about 30 million yen. Among the catches, salmon, trout, and crabs are made into canned food, about 800,000 cans per year, and up to 1 million cans at most. About 500,000 to 700,000 cans are shipped to the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, and the South Pacific annually, with a value of 20 million yen. About 50,000 tons are pickled and refrigerated, worth 10 million yen, for consumption in Japan. The number of fishery operators was more than 100 at most, but it has been sharply reduced after several mergers and acquisitions and the major merger in Showa 7th year. At present, in addition to the Nichiro Fisheries Co., Ltd., there are only four private fishermen. There are about 30,000 fishery workers, using more than 250 ships, weighing more than 30 tons.</p>
<p>(2) Factory ship crab fisheries: Factory ship crab fisheries rose around the 10th year of Taisho era. In the 12th year, they were officially allowed to operate according to the Factory Ship Crab Fisheries Control Regulations. At present, they are fishing in the high seas of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea, etc. The factory ships used are huge, ranging from 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons. The ships have complete canning equipment, fishing gear, fishing boats, and other fishing supplies. Guided by engine boats called solo ships for fishing, they start sailing to the fishing grounds in early May each year to catch crabs with gill nets, make canned food on the ship, and return to the country in August and September. The golden age of the factory ship crab industry was Showa 5th year, when there were 19 ships, totaling 60,000 tons, with more than 7,000 workers, producing more than 400,000 cans of canned food, worth 15 million yen, mostly sold to the Americas. However, in recent years, the world has been in a panic, purchasing power has decreased, and supply exceeds demand, so production has to be restricted. The number of factory ships has been reduced to seven, with 2,000 workers, producing 150,000 cans. The industry has also undergone several mergers. So far, all the workers are merged into Japan Joint Factory Ship Co., Ltd., but there are still two private enterprises that also operate fish meal factory ship fisheries.</p>
<p>(3) Mother ship type salmon trout fisheries: Japanese commonly call it "salmon trout offshore fishing." It arose relatively late and officially caught fish since the establishment of the Mother Ship Type Salmon Trout Control Regulations in Showa 4th year. The fishery is similar to factory ship crab fisheries in Russia</p>
<p>and factory ship crab fisheries are roughly the same. There are mother ships comparable to factory ships, with canning equipment installed in them, and also preservation equipment such as pickling and refrigeration. Catches are limited to salmon and trout. The mother ship is accompanied by solo ships like the crab factory ship. They depart in May each year. Although there are two types of fishing gear, set nets and drift nets, the latter has been more effective recently, so there is a tendency to adopt drift nets entirely. The catches are made into canned, pickled, or frozen products on the mother ship, and return to the mainland in August. In Showa 4th year, there was only one mother ship, 1,000 tons, two solo ships, and a catch of 15 tons, worth more than 5,000 yuan. After that, it made rapid progress. In Showa 8th year, there were 19 mother ships, 28,000 tons, 175 solo ships, and a catch of about 10,000 tons, worth about 5.5 million yuan. Among them, canned products were 200,000 cans, worth more than 4.7 million yuan; pickled products and others were worth 850,000 yuan. Because it is adjacent to the Russian-owned fishing area, there are often conflicts. According to Japanese observations, this fishery is not only limited to the current Kamchatka area, but can also be expanded to the Sea of Okhotsk, Sakhalin, and the eastern part of the Bering Sea in the future. In addition, there is non-mother ship type salmon trout fishery, salmon trout drift net fishery, which began to rise last year on Horonobe Island in the northern Kuril Islands. After obtaining permission from the Hokkaido authorities, they officially started fishing. There were 170 engine ships, and the results were remarkable. The fishery is closely related to the salmon trout fishery in the Northern Pacific.</p>
<p>(4) Cod Fishery: This fishery uses sailboats of 100 to 200 tons to catch cod (ie, Pacific cod) in the high seas of the Sea of Okhotsk. The catches are made into pickled cod or dried cod. This fishery has a considerable history, as mentioned above. Unfortunately, because the route for the failure of the catch has not been explored, and the manufacturing method has not been improved, it has not developed vigorously. There are currently 10 fishing boats, with a catch of 1.3 million tails, worth only more than 200,000, mostly sold domestically, and it is almost an unimportant part of the Northern Pacific fisheries.</p>
<p>(5) Fish Meal Factory Ship Fisheries: This also began in Showa 8th year and was promoted by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The organization of the fishery is a factory ship equipped with fish meal manufacturing machinery, and also has attached mechanical small boats, catching cod, flounder, and other fish and making them into fish meal. The fishing ground is in the high seas of the eastern Bering Sea. In Showa 8th year (1933), two factory ships were dispatched. Although the raw materials were abundant, the results were not as good as expected due to improper operation of the machinery and other obstacles. However, the world's need for fish meal is huge, so the Japanese government has been carefully planning to improve it.</p>
<p>(4) Japan and the Soviet Union's Northern Pacific Fisheries War</p>
<p>In the Tsarist era, the Russians' presence in the Northern Pacific fisheries was minimal. Since the implementation of the current Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty in 1928, the excellent fishing areas of Japanese fishermen have been greatly eroded, and the Nichiro Fisheries Company has suffered even more losses. After Stalin came to power, the Russian side implemented a five-year fisheries plan, and it advanced rapidly. There are now 388 fishing districts, surpassing the Japanese. The Russian crab factory ship first appeared in 1928, and reached 11 in 1931. In addition, there are 20 newly built fishing machinery boats and 17 drift net fishing boats. Also, last year, there was a whaling factory ship and three fishing boats. Although the Japanese fisheries have also fought hard, the number of ships has increased by 30% compared with Showa 4th year (1929), but compared with the Soviet Union's increase of 70%, they are really far behind. In the past, the total number of Japanese and Russian fishing districts was only about 300, but now there are more than 700, so the average catch of the Japanese has a tendency to decrease. Moreover, the rent for fishing districts is gradually increasing (currently about 4 million yuan). Under this double pressure, it is inevitable that the Japanese side will seek countermeasures. And their countermeasures are no different from the intentions of Aoki Seiichi and Foreign Minister Hirota, namely (1) controlling fisheries, and (2) revising the fisheries treaty.</p>
<p>(1) Control of fisheries: Although it is necessary to control all fishing districts, it is especially urgent to control the Russian-owned fisheries in order to counter the Soviet Union's fisheries competition. In Showa 7th year, Nichiro Fisheries Co., Ltd. was established, which was formed by merging 41 Russian-owned fisheries. Although three or four peers refused to participate, the company is actually the sole agency for exercising rights and interests. After that, the control of fisheries there will be easier. As for other fishing districts, because they are all under Japanese laws and regulations, the control work is easier to carry out. (2) Revision of the current fisheries treaty: The current fisheries treaty was concluded in May of Showa 1st year, as mentioned above. Its validity period is eight years. After eight years, it will be revised once, and the previous validity period was every twelve years. The first eight-year period will last until 1936. Since the Japanese are now under severe threat from Soviet fisheries, in addition to seeking self-control, they should also vigorously implement their tough diplomatic policy to protect their Northern Pacific fisheries. This year is 1934, although it is still early, people from all walks of life in Japan are known for their foresight and have already begun to discuss the issue in the parliament. The results will be shown to us by the eloquent facts. We will wait and see.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Work on Fisheries Control</h3>
<p>— Ruo Qian</p>
<p>I recently discussed the necessity of controlling fisheries in our country (see issue 45 of this publication). The reason is that without control, it is difficult to effectively improve the living environment, livelihoods of our fishermen, the marketing of fish products, and the encroachment of imported goods. However, where does control begin? Furthermore, given the disorganized and chaotic state of the fishing industry, coupled with the lack of records, it is clear that success cannot be achieved without prior investigation. The basic requirements of aquatic economics are, first, the natural supply, with the vastness of the ocean and the abundance of usable resources being of utmost importance. However, what are the temperature and water quality within this water area? What is the impact of ocean currents and tides? What is the content of bait, the transparency of light, and the topography of the sea? All of these affect fish production. On the other hand, what is the capacity of fishing boats and gear? How is the catch preserved? How can production be increased during lean years? These are all key to the prosperity or decline of the fishing industry. Moreover, the supply of labor, the amount of capital, the organization of the people, and the joint operation of fisheries all have a close relationship with fish production. But if we ask about the current state of China's aquatic economy, most responses are vague. People only know that there are many fish products and many fishermen. However, if we ask how much fish is actually produced, what are the causes of bankruptcy in fishing villages, and what are the interrelationships in the aquatic economy, there are no statistics, and the figures are inaccurate. Therefore, without thorough investigation, the goal of control cannot be achieved. (Some believe that our country's fishing industry is still in its infancy and should not be controlled. However, it is precisely because it is in its infancy that control is necessary. This has already been mentioned above, so I will not repeat it.) For now, without discussing the natural supply of fisheries, if we only talk about the value of our country's historical catches, the statistical figures recorded in various books are inconsistent. For example, in the article "Fisheries Development in Economic Panic" by Deng Tengyu in the seventh volume, third issue of "China Construction," the value of national fish production cited is calculated at 9,321.4 yuan per nautical mile, so the total is 50 million yuan. However, the "Shen Bao Yearbook" records 153.47 million yuan. On page 66 of the Aquatic Products Special Issue, Volume 7, Issue 2 of "China Construction," there is a record of "National Fish Production Statistics for Last Year (Year 21), with a total value of over 200 million yuan (208,878,695 yuan)." The above is based on the reports of fish merchants. These publications, both published in Year 22, differ so greatly. How can these estimated statistical figures be used as the basis for control? Therefore, to plan for the control of fisheries, we must start with investigation!</p>
<p>Furthermore, controlling fisheries does not mean simply launching a few new-style fishing vessels because fish production is low, or dispatching a few patrol ships to patrol the sea because pirates are rampant. There must first be a detailed investigation, and then a reasonable plan must be established. Moreover, those who want to control fisheries now mostly imitate Europe and the United States. In fact, each country has its own economic background, so how can they be forcibly the same? The aquatic products industry is no exception. For example, the plan for Germany, where freshwater fisheries are developed, cannot be suitable for Norway, where distant-water whaling is prevalent. Again, like Japan, which is now prevalent in fisheries control, its main point, in addition to the control of fisheries harvesting, lies in the control of aquatic product export inspection. And in the United States, since the Blue Eagle movement, the fisheries industry has also been urgently seeking control, but its main point is to maintain the aquatic product canning industry. Therefore, to achieve effective fisheries control in our country, we must first investigate the actual situation in detail as a starting point.</p>
<p>From these three points, it can be seen that to seek the revitalization of our country's fisheries and effective control, we must first conduct a comprehensive survey of the entire fisheries industry. However, to ensure the thoroughness of the investigation, the strategy is definitely not to simply issue an official document entrusting the provinces and counties to report on the fisheries situation. This will not solve the problem. Because the provinces and counties in our country mostly neglect fisheries, even if personnel are sent to investigate and report, they will not be able to provide detailed information due to a lack of fisheries knowledge. Therefore, a National Fisheries Investigation Office must be established by the central government (such as the Central Fisheries Research Institute in the United States, and the Fisheries Experimentation Agency in Japan, which also took investigation as its basis and once had an investigation office). Fisheries technicians should be dispatched to conduct thorough investigations along the coast of the country. On the one hand, investigation sub-offices should be jointly established with the provinces and cities to carry out various basic investigation statistics, and the results should be immediately visible. As for the establishment of the National Fisheries Investigation Office, it is appropriate to have the National Economic Commission set it up. This association holds the power of the national economy, and it is deeply believed that the salvation of our country's industry must apply the policy of controlled economy.</p>

<h3>Financial Market Sluggish Before the Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>Yesterday the market atmosphere was desolate, and trading was weak. Therefore, the overnight interest rate remained at 2% for both morning and afternoon sessions, and the number of discounted bills was also very few. The morning session had over $1.9 million in transfers and over $200,000 in new transactions. The afternoon session had over $300,000 in transactions. The small general meeting had over $200,000 in transactions. Because it was Sunday, banks were closed for the holiday, so there was no news of cash collection. Qianzhuang (money shops) collected over 24 million in foreign public bills, and there were no usual foreign remittance settlements. There were also no significant inward or outward remittances from various routes. Regarding the market conditions for subsidiary currency, the morning and afternoon prices for Jiangnan small silver were both $855, a decrease of $2 from the afternoon price the previous day. 7,500 jiao (10 cents) worth of transactions were made in the morning session, with no transactions in the afternoon session. The morning price for Guangdong small silver was $784.20, and the afternoon price was $784.80, a difference of $0.60 between the two sessions. 65,000 jiao worth of transactions were made in the morning session and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon session. The price of copper coins increased by 1,000 wen (cash), to 293,000 wen, with over 37,200 strings of coins traded, equivalent to $12,700.</p>

<p>February Interest Rates All Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The overnight interest rate for January was very low, only a few percent per day, so the total amount for the month was also small. Yesterday, the agreed-upon interest rate price was still at 2.95%, with arrears accruing at a fixed rate of $4.50. As such, the maximum arrears was only $10.05. As for the interest rate for the eight days from the 1st to the 8th of this month, it was also set at 2.95%. Because the period after the 9th coincided with the month-end closing period, interest was not calculated as usual, and normal interest calculation will resume in March.</p>

<h3>Approaching Lunar New Year, Last Week's Bond Market Gradually Became Quiet</h3>
<p>96 Series Becomes the Target of Speculation</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Closed for Nine Days Starting Saturday</p>
<p>Last week, from January 29th to February 3rd, the Hua Shang Stock Exchange experienced a week of mostly stable trading, without much rise or fall. The environment was stable, and confidence was strong. However, market prices were already high, and buying was opportunistic. Southwest was safe, the political situation was consolidated, but speculation was timid and did not dare to short sell. Those with firm determination mostly held on, waiting for changes. The number of accounts was very large. Although the number of people delivering goods was quite large, the number of arbitrageurs was also considerable. The mutual restraint between each side led to this stagnant situation. However, the futures for February were very short-term. Starting this Saturday, the market will be closed for nine days of business. After opening, there will be four days left, so there are nine days in total before and after the holiday. It is expected that large investors who want to roll over or close out their positions will prepare in advance. Therefore, there is still a relatively large change in the future of market prices. The market situation shows that the highest price is at least 60% or more, and the pullback is only one yuan, with no further downward movement. Although the shorts have not wavered, the longs are still strongly defending. Market prices may rise first and then fall. If the Salt Tax reaches around $52, there will definitely be a pullback. There is nothing special to say about the daily trend. Trading was closed on Monday. Futures for March started trading on Tuesday, rising 60 to 70 cents. On Wednesday, it fell a few cents to one yuan. After that, it entered a stagnant path with very small fluctuations, also due to the Lunar New Year. Most banks have contracted their business, and trading has also become sluggish. Among them, the two that are slightly noteworthy are Jin Short and the 96 Series. Jin Short's trading is gradually becoming active and has entered a stable path. There were relatively large fluctuations in the 96 Series prices, because the prices of each bond market were already high. Short selling was not the right time, and long positions were also dull. As a result, it turned to the 96 Series as a target for speculation, because it has no regulations, no interest, and no major changes. As a result of last week's market prices, most were slightly better by 20 to 30 cents to one yuan. The total number of transactions was 63,832,000 yuan. The situation of its highs, lows, rises and falls is listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>US and Indian Cotton Turn Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was firm due to good cloth market, strong Wall Street, and active buyers. The spot price increased by 15 points, and the futures price increased by 14 to 19 points. The spot price of English cotton increased by 5 points, and the futures price decreased by 2 points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton increased by 9 points.

<h3>Rice Markets in North and South Both Slacken</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 70 ships arrived from various routes, carrying over 9,000 shi of goods, causing sentiment to weaken. Each bank, including the Nanyang bank, was full due to continuous smooth operations, and only needed to fill the deficit of a few hundred bags. The market conditions for 青角晚包 (Qingjiao late rice package), 松酒 (Song Wine), 西练 (Western Practice) and other late rice varieties all saw a price decrease. Thick japonica rice such as 常苏 (Changsu) and 南港 (Nangang) and 杜洋秈 (Du Yang Xian) rice saw a sharp price decrease of nearly 1 jiao, changing阴元 (Yin Yuan) 赤币 (Red Coin) softening角 (jiao).

<h3>Literati of "Commercial Competitive Bidding"</h3>
<p>— Qing Nong</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Congwen attacked the "Shanghai School" in the North (in the Literary Weekly of the Tianjin Dagongbao), saying it was a "combination of the talent of famous scholars and the pursuit of commercial gain," which aroused the rebukes of the "Shanghai School" literati in Shanghai and the misunderstanding of a few people who sell articles for a living. Regarding who is the "Shanghai School," I have already said in "Free Talk." The day before yesterday, Mr. A Yan also published "On Selling Articles for a Living" to defend the Shanghai School, which makes it impossible not to speak.</p>
<p>Mr. A Yan based his argument on the point of "commercial competitive bidding" and said, "In summary, the biggest accusation that Mr. Shen Congwen and others make against the Shanghai School literati is 'commercial competition.' The so-called 'commercial competition' here encompasses many things, but this reminds me of the matter of literati 'selling articles for a living.'" (Original text copied). Then, he expounded on the great principle of "selling articles for a living" to the fullest extent and attacked Mr. Shen Congwen, saying, "To put it harshly, his article attacking people for writing articles for a living was written for the sake of manuscript fees or even for the sake of manuscript fees." (Original text copied). This kind of misunderstanding only serves to "aid the evildoers" of the "Shanghai School" literati, and for Mr. Shen Congwen, it is "biting Lü Dongbin, not recognizing a good person." I won't say much here, just point out the meaning in Mr. Shen Congwen's original text: he doesn't think that all writers in Shanghai are "Shanghai School." He heard that Mr. Lu Xun is certainly not "Shanghai School." So, who is this group of so-called "Shanghai School" literati? I exposed their tricks in "Free Talk":</p>
<p>Those who "steal the work of established writers" are "Shanghai School." Those who claim to have borrowed the excellent works of friends to read but then publish them under their own name to become famous are "Shanghai School." Those who are already famous but use their own "brand" to publish the works of unknown writers to make money are "Shanghai School." Those who translate articles from foreign magazines or entire works without indicating that they are translations are "Shanghai School." Those who buy translated works at low prices and use their own "brand" to gain both fame and fortune are "Shanghai School." Now, let's add one or two more types: Those who collect, cut, and paste the works of other writers to compile and publish collections of short stories, poetry, etc., to make money are "Shanghai School." Those who watch foreign movies or read foreign novels and then steal the original idea, changing its appearance to write novels as their own creations, are "Shanghai School," and so on. This group of "Shanghai School" literati sell both their personality and their manuscripts for the sake of "commercial competitive bidding," which is completely different from those who "sell articles for a living." Mr. A Yan seems to have misunderstood and defended the "Shanghai School" literati, even associating the meaning of "commercial competitive bidding" with "selling articles for a living." This is probably because he doesn't understand the reality of the Shanghai literary scene. I will say it again here: this group of "Shanghai School" literati sell both their personality and their manuscripts, so don't blame the "Beijing School" writers for despising them. People in the know are aware of this, so there's no need to babble on, but they are precisely "merchants and thieves." If they are not exposed and attacked, it would be a shame to the literary world. If they think that because they sell articles in Shanghai and people scold monks, they think they are also monks and become indignant and argue, that is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>This group of "merchants and thieves," the "Shanghai School" literati, include both old and young, left-wing, right-wing, and trivial literary factions. Those who are already famous have a terrible reputation, and those who are just becoming famous are also well-known. We who "sell articles for a living" can only regard them as "traitors" and attack them. Moreover, society should impose moral sanctions on this group of people.</p>
<p>The place of competitive bidding, the reason why "Shanghai School" literati become treacherous merchants and philistines, is also due to the influence of the environment, which is not surprising. "The past is gone, the future can be pursued," and "it's never too late to mend the fold after losing sheep." Here, I sincerely hope that the "Shanghai School" literati will strive for creative work from now on and emit a brilliant light for the Chinese literary scene. Otherwise, the literary field is ultimately not a commercial field, and the tricks of treacherous merchants and philistines can only deceive people for a while and will eventually not be able to hide their tails. After their true colors are revealed, the dog meat they sell will ultimately be dog meat. Readers have already identified the goods and will never mistake them for mutton.</p>
<h3>Is This "Human Relationships and Worldly Wisdom"?</h3>
<p>— Mao Xinyi</p>
<p>Brother,</p>
<p>It's been a long time since we met. I hope you are in good health? Recently, I did something that felt quite good; but alas, the matter hasn't been settled, and I've already been ridiculed by my relatives and friends, and given the nickname "foolish child who doesn't understand worldly wisdom." Alas, I'm filled with anger and have nowhere to vent it, so I'm specifically coming to you to complain, hoping you won't ridicule me like them?</p>
<p>The matter is like this...</p>
<p>One holiday afternoon during the New Year, I saw in the newspaper that the 　　 cinema was showing a domestically produced film with relatively correct ideology, so I invited a few of my cousins to go to the cinema together.</p>
<p>When we entered the cinema, it was already crowded. Because we couldn't find a row of empty seats together, we each found our own seat. My cousins sat in the back rows, and I sat in an empty seat in one of the front rows. In the row in front of my seat, there was a girl of about eighteen or nineteen, probably her younger sister.</p>
<p>When the film started and it was time for the five-minute intermission, the incident broke out. Suddenly, three student-looking young men came, wearing indigo cloth gowns, with their sleeves rolled up to their elbows and the high collars of their shirts unbuttoned, like a stove for cooking; their hair was combed very smoothly. They ran to the side of the girl sitting in front of me, showing frivolous smiles, and asked her a series of questions. The poor girl's face turned red and white, and she had nowhere to hide. At this time, the audience sitting near the girl acted as if nothing had happened, and some even seemed to be laughing at these young men's antics! As for me, the fire of anger in my heart had already burst out of my eyes. The five-minute intermission was over, and the whole place went dark again. Unexpectedly, these shameless young men actually made some despicable and rude gestures. At this time, my line of sight was blocked by them again, and I couldn't bear it any longer, so I stood up and warned these guys...</p>
<p>"Hey, this is a cinema, please maintain your dignity! This isn't..."</p>
<p>"You're a third party, what's it to you?" one of them retorted.</p>
<p>"Is it right for you to bully people?"</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>I argued with them.</p>
<p>"Okay! You're taking up the cudgels for someone, good." After he said this, he whispered a few words in the ear of one of the others, as if he wanted him to watch me; the other two went out.</p>
<p>They were in the midst of an intensely interesting activity (?), and suddenly having their good dreams shattered by my scolding, they were naturally very unhappy. Two of them went out without watching the movie, and another young man was watching me by my side, undoubtedly wanting to make things difficult for me. However, stubborn me, I believed that justice and reason should prevail everywhere; their behavior of seducing female students was shameless, what was there to fear... Thinking this, I shifted my gaze back to the screen.</p>
<p>When the film was over, the girl in the front row followed the audience and left, but that young man followed me closely. I ran to my cousins in the back row and told them about the situation, expecting them to be filled with righteous indignation and help me, but unexpectedly, they not only didn't sympathize with me but also said I was meddling!</p>
<p>When we came out of the cinema, the young man who had been following me shouted towards the opposite side of the cinema, and suddenly more than a dozen ruffian-looking people surrounded us. Although I knew that this was "outnumbered," the anger in my chest could no longer be contained, and I decided to fight them to the death. My cousins, who understood "human relationships and worldly wisdom," finally persuaded these thugs to leave and dragged me home.</p>
<p>Back home, I angrily told my family about the incident, but they all coldly ridiculed me, calling me "stupid" and "a busybody."</p>
<p>What's more, when my father heard about it, he shook his head and sighed, saying, "You foolish child, you really don't understand human relationships and worldly wisdom!" Alas, at this time, the emotions of resentment and anger in my chest, forgive my old pen, can no longer be described...</p>
<p>Brother, until now, a question mark is still spinning in my mind "?", which is... is this "human relationships and worldly wisdom"?</p>
<p>Please tell me this, I am looking forward to it. With best wishes,</p>
<p>Xinyi up</p>
<h3>In a Bitter Winter Night</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>It was a bitter winter night. In the sky, only a few stars twinkled dimly. The deathly stillness of the night deeply enveloped this entire vast, quiet earth. The small, cramped room naturally could not escape the shroud of twilight, although a trace of dim lamplight filtered in through the window frame, making its tranquility, desolation, and darkness even more evident.</p>
<p>Mei trembled, her muscles contracting and clashing. In this bitter winter midnight, she wore only an undershirt and pants, huddled in the corner of the bed. The sound of her upper and lower lips and teeth chattering could be heard clearly in the still air. But she was silent, like a prisoner awaiting punishment, meek as a lamb waiting for all the harsh penalties that were about to befall her. She shed tears silently, using them to gain temporary comfort.</p>
<p>Sitting on the head of the bed opposite Mei and currently raging was Mei's mother, using her supreme parental authority to abuse her only daughter.</p>
<p>"Ha! You think that this year you are already twenty-three years old, and can not be subject to my control? You often say what men and women over the age of twenty have legal right to marital freedom, not by what parental orders, matchmaker's words of trade-style marriage. Ha! Tell you honestly, I do not understand what is 'freedom' and 'law,' so you stop such dreams. Ha! What you are educated people, unwilling to sacrifice yourself under the trade-style of marriage, honestly, what's on your mind I would not understand? It turns out that the lover you know now is a penniless poor man, a poor boy, so you want to use these words to make me aware that it is best to marry you off to him. You this wretched fate of a worthless thing fundamentally does not know how to appreciate. Like taking a daughter-in-law this kind of marriage is still the ultimate. Ha..." A cold laugh coming from her nose. She took a sip of strong tea, and still continued her fierce scolding. "What Shanghai has a few notables, they are not subject to marriage procedures to combine. This is simply a vulgar trick, a prostitute's behavior.... You go tell them to take five thousand dollars to come, otherwise sever ties, you are my person, everything is up to my sovereignty. I'm afraid your mule won't be able to turn into a dog?... Now, unless you elope, unless you do not live in Shanghai. Otherwise, you cannot escape my grasp... Alas! Family misfortune to have kind parents raise you this kind of worthless thing to come. Dares to walk shoulder to shoulder with men on the main thoroughfare! Alas... you this shameful worthless thing! Bringing disgrace to the whole family... You will sternly question me again: my older and younger brothers can go out with their girlfriends? Do you not know? Men do not have any relationship, it's the parents of other people who are losing face. How can we manage so much?"</p>
<p>Alas! Although tonight, I suffered my mother's beating and trampling on my body, I know that this is the necessary sacrifice before doing anything for truth, and I, moreover, am sacrificing for love, what a worthwhile thing this is. I should do it, do it for the truth, because I am a young woman, and also an educated young woman. We must take up our heavy responsibilities to save the innocent women later, so that they may have a chance to wake up, and avoid our mistakes, or even fall into a deep and inextricable whirlpool. We only need to identify our goal, and go forward bravely. Mother does not respect my personality. She treats me as a machine to be manipulated by others. I am a thing to be bought and sold like merchandise and toys. There is completely no existence of my own individual development. She ignored my mind and personality. Like my cousin, she was tempted by money, and as a result became a merchant's second wife. A girl of seventeen or eighteen marries an old man of advanced age, the mental suffering is not worth mentioning. This merchant, close to sixty, was eager to have children. Finally, because my cousin could not produce even half a son or daughter, she was abandoned by him. Although women have the important task of increasing the population of the country, women are not exclusively provided as a tool for reproduction and a device for venting desires! Women have even greater responsibilities!</p>
<p>Although women have been insulted as "toys," "desire-venting devices," and "reproductive tools" for a very long time, in every line of history, in every family, I dimly saw traces of fresh blood not yet wiped clean. I smelled the stench of blood. I caught a glimpse of the executioner's dirty hands and sharp knives. Ah! I am afraid. But alas! Who will mend the land covered with wounds? We must reach out and call the oppressed women, the humiliated women, to rise up and start a vigorous women's movement, so that everyone knows that we women are people with blood and spirit. We have an independent personality...</p>
<p>...Mei was trembling, but she was thinking such great things silently in her head.</p>
<h3>Four Fingers</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>"Snap." A crisp, clear sound. The four fingers of Old Wang's right hand were chopped off in the rapid rotation of the gears in an instant. The wheel continued to spin with his blood and flesh, and the speed did not change slightly because of the increase in human flesh debris in the gap.</p>
<p>A sudden and intense stinging pain violently attacked his whole body. He only felt a darkness in front of his eyes, and his state of mind was like a sea ship lost in the night, being tossed by raging waves in the vast, boundless sea of ink.</p>
<p>Quickly and unsteadily, a gray pillar just happened to support his collapsing body.</p>
<p>Fresh red blood flowed like tap water without a faucet. He instinctively used his only intact left hand to tightly pinch the wound, but he did not feel any pain. What he felt now was only bitterness, a bitterness that would be forever engraved in his mind.</p>
<p>His wrinkled face was so pale that it was terrible. A tear of heartbreak trickled from the tightly closed, deep-set eyes. His disheveled head drooped weakly to his chest, and the corners of his mouth trembled slightly. At first glance, he looked like a drunkard half-dead.</p>
<p>"Go to the doctor's office! Dead man!" He was awakened from his bewilderment by this shout. He slightly opened his tired eyes. A tall man wearing a factory employee uniform was standing in front of him. Under his condescending gaze, this unfortunate injured man was so annoying!</p>
<p>He slowly took a note to go to the doctor's office from the tall man's hand. He rediscovered that there was still a glimmer of light remaining in front of his eyes, which was the hope that he could restore his original hand with the skillful treatment of the doctor. So, he mustered the last bit of courage and slowly dragged his heavy legs towards the doctor's office.</p>
<p>Blood was still dripping down, passing by many workers along the way, and everyone cast a look of terror and sympathy on him.</p>
<p>When he stepped into the small doctor's office, the doctor in white was sitting at the writing desk, absorbed in studying a woman's photo.</p>
<p>"Doctor! Pity my hand!..." He prepared many, many words he wanted to complain and beg to this great doctor, but he swallowed it all after saying only one sentence, and could only express the sourness of his heart with his tearful eyes.</p>
<p>The doctor didn't seem to have noticed anyone by his side, and moreover was talking to him, a pair of dull eyes staring fixedly at the woman's photo.</p>
<p>After a long while, the doctor accidentally turned his head and glanced at him in surprise, and then a layer of displeasure was immediately painted on his face.</p>
<p>"Doctor! Will I not be disabled!" His voice was so trembling, like a criminal being tried waiting for the solemn judge to announce his life and death.</p>
<p>"Maybe not!" The doctor's tone was so ambiguous that he had no courage to continue to ask. He could only let fate control everything.</p>
<p>After a perfunctory bandage, he was ordered by the doctor to withdraw from the doctor's office, only to be blocked by the tall man at the beginning.</p>
<p>"From tomorrow onwards, you don't have to come again! This is a month's wages as medical compensation."</p>
<p>He said, handing over a "wage slip."</p>
<p>"Um! Let me come back to work when my injury is healed! Doctor! Have pity on me..." He was sentenced to death! He could only make a final plea in an attempt to save himself from one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>"No! The factory cannot support disabled people. Because you have been an old worker in the factory for twenty years, you are specially treated. It is up to you whether you want it or not. Anyway, the factory does not necessarily have to spend this money unjustly."</p>
<p>"Then, doctor! Please think for me, a month's wages cannot buy a complete hand!"</p>
<p>"What? The factory hires you with money to work, and didn't call you to chop off your own hands."</p>
<p>"..........."</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense! If you don't want the money, get out quickly."</p>
<p>He finally took the "wage slip" from the tall man's hand and went to the accounting room to receive a dozen or so one-yuan banknotes. He looked at the red and green patterns of the small stack of banknotes with his tearful eyes, and finally walked out of the factory gate alone and silently, heading towards his unpredictable future.</p>
<h3>More on Grand Funeral Processions</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>The funeral procession of Navy Admiral Du Xigui was very simple because the honor guard was simple, with only a few musical ensembles, unlike Sheng Xingsheng's lavishness, with a sea of people watching, which was greatly disappointing. This shows that the Chinese people (at least the idlers in Shanghai) are more interested in watching grand funeral processions than in watching a fire from across the river!</p>
<p>Grand funeral processions... have solemn and awesomely large road-opening deities. There are monks and nuns, who are diagonally draped in colorful cassocks, their snow-white heads shining, winking and making faces (naturally, they are still constantly chanting "Namo Amitabha" in their mouths). There are the 　　 and similar figures, wearing red hats, embroidered robes, and majestic crowns, carrying flags, umbrellas, sedan chairs, and pavilions on their shoulders and hands. Especially their leather-like mud feet, which make a "ba ba" sound as they run on the asphalt road, are nothing less than a comical expression of military bands keeping time. There are the 　　　watching until the filial sons are tied up, full of preparation, and then start to flow out; and fearing that the heart of the earth will absorb the force, it sucks down the snot and saliva. Thus, the so-called sea of people, the leading and anticipating viewers, return when their excitement has ended, and even because they are so envious, they forget themselves, and sigh, saying, "He can be taken and replaced!"</p>
<p>Such a grand spectacle of a large funeral procession, those who watch it are "very happy," and those who participate in it, seeing the liveliness of the show, get what they want, and of course, secretly take pride in themselves, and perhaps tell their friends: "Today, it can be considered extremely lively, but we can also be said to have satisfied the desires of the viewers!" As a result, those who watch the large funeral processions and those who participate in the large funeral processions are all happy. Although funerals are inauspicious events, they have now turned into great auspicious and celebratory events!</p>
<p>To put it more clearly... the fact that funerals become auspicious and celebratory, making people "all happy," is actually because the host can "spend greatly" with their financial resources. If not, seeing the same funeral procession, everyone will cover their noses and walk away, cursing "bad luck!" Common people often sigh "funeral head! funeral head!" because seeking help is unsuccessful, and planning things fails, which probably refers to this non-large funeral procession, or only carrying a white coffin and passing by. It can be seen that funerals are, after all, inauspicious events.</p>
<p>When an individual encounters an unfavorable thing, it is called "funeral head," and when a country encounters a great misfortune, such as the loss of territory, it can naturally be called "great funeral head!" The people of the country, watching this great funeral procession of the country, do not know if they can also be "all happy"?</p>
<p>Someone said, "No one wants to watch a large funeral procession, so naturally there will be no large funeral procession." I think this statement is very reasonable.</p>

<h3>The Lonely Person (6)</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>After Jingyi entered the room, her dark eyes rolled behind her long eyelashes. How could she not plan for A'bao, who would be so closely related to her in three days? Xiaoxun was a neurotic artist, whose focus was on "truth," "goodness," and "beauty." Jingyi was a woman who would be a good mother and wife, and her focus naturally couldn't be primarily on "beauty." Certain things would take up space for a small bed in the future, and certain relationships in their shared life needed to change. Jingyi gently told Kejia about the important things that Xiaoxun hadn't noticed. Kejia then bluntly said, "What kind of gift? Just get a small bed."</p>
<p>Amidst the rough laughter, the neurotic laughter, the coquettish laughter, and the bored laughter, Afu carried the dishes upstairs.</p>
<p>The four of them casually occupied one side of the square table each. The dishes weren't lavish, but they were all to everyone's taste. Naturally, Fengjing pork knuckle was among them.</p>
<p>"Little brother, this cup is to thank you for your hard work today." Kejia lightly poured half a cup for Xiaoxun.</p>
<p>"I'll do it myself," Xiaoxun said, shaking his naturally wavy hair, snatching the wine pot from Kejia's hand.</p>
<p>He poured a cup for everyone, then filled his own cup and drank it all in one gulp. "To celebrate Kejia's 'trick' being a success, we should drink heartily!" he said, filling another cup to the brim.</p>
<p>Yeniu twitched the corner of his mouth, swallowing the words he wanted to say. At the same time, Jingwen raised her glass...</p>
<p>"To celebrate little brother's recovery!" She raised her head and finished the glass of wine in one go.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sister of my sister," Xiaoxun said, downing another cup and starting to pour again.</p>
<p>"Brother..." Yeniu twitched the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>"Today, we should let little brother drink his fill," Jingwen interrupted, "for the sake of little brother seeing a woman he shouldn't see in three days."</p>
<p>The reader might have thought Jingwen was laughing mindlessly, but she wasn't. She was staring at Zhu Xiaoxun's face, which was expressionless. Kejia laughed roughly, but he couldn't say a teasing word. His gaze shifted from Jingwen's face to Xiaoxun's, and then from Xiaoxun's to Jingwen's.</p>
<p>Jingyi held her wine glass, watching everyone. She didn't understand, of course she didn't understand. Xiaoxun shook his naturally wavy hair nervously. He finished the wine in front of him, pushed the wine pot away, and said, "Okay, I won't drink anymore." Smiling, he picked up his chopsticks to eat the Fengjing pork knuckle. His sister liked to eat it.</p>
<p>That was a truly mindless laugh. Kejia also gave an awkward, rough laugh. Jingyi held her wine glass, watching the three of them. She didn't understand, of course she didn't understand.</p>
<p>"Sister, eat, eat the Fengjing pork knuckle."</p>
<p>Jingwen recounted the events on the train. The four of them talked, ate their dinner, and Jingyi suggested going to see a movie. After Kejia and Jingwen agreed, Xiaoxun, of course, had to yield to the majority.</p>
<p>The March spring breeze stirred the hearts of every young man and woman, rustled the small trees along Avenue Joffre, and ruffled Zhu Xiaoxun's naturally wavy hair. All sorrow fell behind the joy. They entered the cinema.</p>
<p>In the pitch-black cinema, I cannot tell the reader anything specific. Jingyi and Kejia's conversation was so low, like every young couple, that apart from the two of them, an observer would have no way of knowing if it was merely "brother" or "sister" being addressed. Xiaoxun and Jingwen seemed to have nothing to say in this setting. It wouldn't be surprising to the reader if he cried neurotically and innocently.</p>

<h3>Prospects for Soviet Films in 1934</h3>
<p>— Translated by Luo Ping</p>
<p>At the Script Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>Reports from Various Directors</p>
<p>The Script Discussion Conference (Theme Plan Conference), which will determine the direction of the entire Soviet film industry in 1934, has not yet concluded. However, if one wants to know the future of the Soviet film industry in 1934 in advance, one can catch a glimpse of it from the reports of various directors at the conference.</p>
<p>Here are the reports of various directors:</p>
<p>Eisenstein: "I am currently working on a sketch of Moscow, and I hope to complete the film in 1934, although whether it can be completed depends not only on me personally."</p>
<p>Es-Shi-Xie-Bu: "I am currently producing 'The Woman and the Reporter.' The screenplay is written by screenwriter Lai Ping and depicts the lives of women in the Soviet Union. The reporter is me, a director who also works as a journalist. I will report everything I see truthfully."</p>
<p>Alexander Lev: "I have completed a comedy film called 'Jazz,' which will be released in March. What next? I am writing a comedy with Gataev about collective farms, titled 'Yadaga' (Obarka) or 'The Four Bridegrooms.'"</p>
<p>Ma Qilai Tuo: "The screenplay I wrote myself, 'The Flying People,' is ready to be put on the screen. The film depicts the lives of aviators, but I have referred extensively to Mr. Slavien's screenplay 'The Private Life of Peter Vinolaev.'"</p>
<p>Pudovkin: "It seems difficult to say. I haven't made a decision about the future yet, but I have already started filming 'Navigation' (Ariation) with Vanlatmako Gai."</p>
<p>Lom: "Everything is ready. The screenplay, written by Scott Lipetson, is called 'Criminals,' and its meaning and subject matter are taken from Gorky's works, depicting the events of the OGPU Labor Commune (OGPU Labor Commune)."</p>
<p>Billiev: "I am ready to shoot a screenplay written by Ivanov. The screenplay depicts the construction of the Moscow subway. I have decided to complete the filming and release it before the subway opens (around the 17th anniversary of the October Revolution)."</p>
<p>Chai Lafulev: "I am planning to shoot a strange screenplay called 'The Flight to the Moon,' also known as 'Long Live Youth,' written by Freemanov. It is a scientific utopian story. In this film, you can see Moscow in the 1950s and how rockets fly from Moscow to the moon. At the same time, I plan to show the various uses and plans for Moscow, from Theater Square to Lenin's Mausoleum, including new buildings and the completed Palace of the Soviet Federation."</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Dr. Bull"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Dr. Bull</p>
<p>Produced by Fox, screening at the Grand Shanghai Theatre</p>
<p>I think that anyone with a little life experience will be deeply moved after watching this film.</p>
<p>Let's see, what kind of person is this Dr. Bull? He has a kind and loving nature. He is not bound by etiquette, but his undisguised, pure heart is fully revealed in this lack of formality. What a lovable doctor!</p>
<p>He loves himself and loves others. He can heal people's diseases, and he also heals the lovesickness of young men and women with a kind heart. Whether it is heavy snow or late at night, he selflessly braves hardships to save the world. From young to old, from male to female, everyone receives love and health in his grace. Ah, how should we bless such a doctor?</p>
<p>However, people do not understand his kind heart. They despise his personality because of his lack of formality, and they ridicule and curse him for his selfless relationship with the widowed woman, Jiebai, who is his only sympathizer. Of course, he can ignore this. However, foolish and cunning people do not stop there. Furthermore, because a newly arrived doctor has modern equipment and a beautiful car, Dr. Bull is seen as an outdated person of no value. Perhaps Dr. Bull is a rather conservative person, but he is ultimately a deep scientific researcher. Moreover, when he identifies the source of the epidemic, isn't the other doctor helpless despite having perfect mechanical equipment? However, ignorant men and women still mock him in a superstitious way, and cunning people attack him for personal gain. Thus, his status declines, and only the kind widow can sympathize with him. Let's see, this is how serious life is! At a time when justice and righteousness are destroyed by those who call themselves gentlemen, how grateful people will be for such a kind and lovable doctor! Faust sincerely saves the world, but is pelted with stones by the world. This hypocritical society is truly too cruel!</p>
<p>Let me say one more thing, I am deeply moved by it.</p>
<p>Now let's appreciate the acting techniques.</p>
<p>When the screen unfolds from the darkness, we see a train station marked with the words "New Window," which indicates the place where the story takes place. Afterwards, the train arrives and stops, but no one gets off. Only a parcel is thrown out of the window, which shows that the place is a desolate village. The train slowly departs, and the sound gradually fades away, harmonizing with the bell of the village church. The camera follows the female postal worker as she carries the parcel back from the station. Thus, the church and houses are revealed in the sound of the bell. The snow up to the ankles, sparse pedestrians, the whole thing is a rural picture. Then there is the post office and telephone exchange, a female operator and a female postal worker, their faces floating with monotonous and peaceful emotions. After that, there is the church, the bell, and the singing of hymns. These deeply capture our emotions in the air of harmony between sound and picture, creating a quiet and beautiful winter rural scene.</p>
<p>In addition, let's see how the director portrays the protagonist's character. He hums songs, carries a bundle of firewood on his shoulder, lies on the sofa in the widow's house listening to her read a novel, sings loudly in the church, sings in the bar, speaks softly when he diagnoses patients, looks at the other doctor's new car with admiration and envy, does not let women sit first when eating, proposes to the widow on his knees, and does not want to argue with people in the face of attacks. He sits alone in the dim light, feeling disappointed and sad. In short, he is a kind person in a peaceful village, and he has a lovable personality. This is entirely the result of the director's extremely clever and delicate work. In particular, the relationship between him and the widow is depicted in a natural chorus, eating wine without formality, and sleeping on the sofa listening to novels. What a harmonious and pure state!</p>
<p>What should also be mentioned is that when Dr. Bull delivers a baby, the scene first shows the tense atmosphere in the dark night, silence. When the child is born, the scene shows the faint light outside the house, the crowing of chickens and barking of dogs, the sky is dawning. The second time, the scene shows that it is already dawn outside, the morning light is shining, and the sound of chickens is still heard. Dr. Bull comes out, and someone sees him off at the door. The quiet atmosphere makes us feel cold. This is indeed the director's most successful technique, and the coordination of light and shadow in the photography is so wonderful!</p>
<p>In short, this is an excellent film, but I am afraid that it will not be loved by the general audience who like excitement. If so, then I will truly feel sorry for the art of film in China.</p>
<h3>Review of "Looking Forward" Guotai</h3>
<p>— Li Dan</p>
<p>The world economic panic is an undeniable fact, and thus MGM capitalists had to take rice as the theme. "Looking Forward" depicts the fate of a department store that has been hit by the economic panic.</p>
<p>Austerity policies are seen by capitalists as a panacea for economic crises. Sacrificed beneath it are vast numbers of salaried workers and producers.</p>
<p>Old bookkeeper Peng Deng, although he has served in the Ganbaili, Shanweisi department store for forty years, the terrible unemployment has ruthlessly fallen on his head after all.</p>
<p>In the office, Peng Deng is happily, with a little old man's boasting, talking about the issue of staff cuts. He never dreamed that Shanweisi would call him to tell him the unfortunate news of his dismissal. His loyal service heart still thought that Shanweisi had some instructions on business, so he went to see Shanweisi with that large and thick book. When he heard this unfortunate news, his lips trembled, and he was stunned like he had been electrocuted. Shanweisi told him to sit, and he collapsed into the chair. He couldn't trust his own ears; "Have I done something wrong?" But finally, he had to hand the book to Shanweisi and sadly walked out of the department store's door. He saw the newspaper seller and habitually reached into his pocket. Suddenly, the hunger cries of his wife and children rang in his ears. Now he was an unemployed person! So, he put his trembling hand back out of his pocket. When he reached the door of his house, he hesitated to go in immediately, thinking about how to tell his wife, "I've lost my job." Here, Lyon, Barrymore (playing Peng Deng)'s expression is worth special mention. He not only used facial expressions, but also his skinny hands, old back, and heavy steps to portray a pitiful victim of the current system.</p>
<p>However, "Looking Forward" tells us later that this sacrificed old man is so gently defending his master! Naturally, MGM's capitalists want to give a little reward to such a loyal figure, so "Looking Forward" tells us that this old man finally had a day of "reversal of fortune."</p>
<p>Not only is this old man's "reversal of fortune" hoped for, but the "reversal of fortune" of Shanweisi and their social stratum is what "Looking Forward" wants to convey to the audience.</p>
<p>However, this is entirely an illusion, just like the rainbow outside the window that Ganluling, Shanweisi's daughter, sees.</p>
<p>The fate of capitalism has reached the twilight period, and the rainbow in the sky is definitely not a Symbol of hope for a brighter day; we can see the sadness of disillusionment and loss behind the brilliant glory.</p>
<p>When the earth is still dominated by storms, and the sky is so gloomy, when will God clear up and sunlight come to the world? This is what Shanweisi and others are hoping for.</p>
<p>However, this sun that comes with the storm will never shine on Shanweisi and others. "Looking Forward" is just their pathetic self-mockery!</p>
<h3>"Abandoning Love" Grand Ballroom Set, Paramount Filmed as Sound News</h3>
<p>— Wu Peng</p>
<p>The last great ballroom set of "Abandoning Love," produced by Guogiang Film Company, surpasses any national film ballroom set, costing more than a thousand yuan. The film originally planned not to use this ballroom set, because it was used too much in national films, but because in terms of consciousness, it needs to be used to make a powerful description, because during the January 28th War, many bloody men galloped on the battlefield, and I don't know how many people laughed in the ballroom, so it had to be used. When the scene of the set was filmed, Mr. Wang of the China Sound News Department of the American Paramount Company led staff to take hundreds of feet of sound news and transported it to the American head office, which will be shown with the main film in various countries, also breaking a new record. Not only will the director of the film, Ji Fanzhi, and the working situation of the leading actors Zhao Yingcai, Ni Hongyu, Zhuang Xiaoren, etc., appear on screens in various countries, but also the company's great sets and perfect equipment will also add glory to the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Queen Christina (4)</h3>
<p>— Hu Chen</p>
<p>They were galloping in the snow. In the veins of the young queen was a vibrant, new interest. This was the joy of life and enjoying new freedom. Away from the thousands of pounds of state affairs, away from the calls of the hateful, never-ending responsibilities! Back to her old self, young and vibrant! Not some queen! A carefree heart was inspiring her spirit. The low-hanging branches shed waves of snow on her shoulders as she passed. Christina laughed wildly, and the horse ran faster. What was she seeking in this adventurous gallop! Where was she going? But it didn't matter. She was free!</p>
<p>Forward... Forward... They twisted and turned around the peaks... The pure white snow rested on the dark branches of the fir trees... Line after line of ice shards, glittering like countless crystal pillars... What a wonderful natural world this was. Now it was the time of the setting sun, and in a circle of white light, there was a reflection of purple shadows. Christina reined in her horse and looked around at the vast expanse. Something in the valley below suddenly caught her eye. She pointed to it with her whip for Olaf to see. Olaf looked down in the direction she was pointing and saw a train of vehicles moving slowly through the deep snow in the valley. The first few vehicles were extremely luxurious and beautiful, and the rest were all loaded with many boxes of various sizes and sundry items! As they were watching, they suddenly saw the train of vehicles in danger. One of the vehicles in front, the most luxurious one, decorated in the most beautiful way, suddenly fell into a ditch on the side. The vehicle was tilted and could not move forward, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Many workers were driving the horses, but the vehicle still did not move. A young man, who seemed very handsome, stuck his head out. They also heard a burst of cursing, which did not sound like the local accent. Olaf said with a very disdainful tone: "Foreigners!" Christina said happily: "Spaniards". It must be the Spanish ambassador. She thought for a moment, then immediately whipped her horse and ran down, with Olaf following behind.</p>
<p>Christina ran to the side of the train of vehicles and, in fluent Spanish, instructed them to take a coat and put it under the wheels that were stuck in the snow, and borrowed a few horses from other vehicles. Then she waved her hand, and the vehicle suddenly rushed forward. Olaf was stunned by her fluent Spanish. And the young man was leaning out of the car window, looking around. The car suddenly rushed forward and knocked him down. Christina laughed. The young man came out, and Christina felt a strange interest again. The man was tall and straight, with handsome features, bright black eyes, and a small moustache of exotic flavor on his lips. He put his hands on his waist and looked at Christina for a while, then said, "Oh, do you find this very interesting?" He was obviously angry, but his voice sounded very nice. "It's all the fault of those trashy drivers!" he roared. Christina told him softly, "It's not the fault of the drivers. This kind of thing happens often in the deep snow of winter." The young man said, "What a wonderful country! What wonderful roads! And this weather!" He was shivering from the cold. (To be continued)</p>
