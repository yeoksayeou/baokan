<p>時評</p>
<h3>蘇俄加入國聯與互障公約恒</h3>
<p>蘇俄近因法國之竭力拉攏。頗有加入國聯之意。此舉一旦實現。自足稍挽九一八以來國聯已墜之聲威。國聯之弱點。在於本身缺乏實力。而盟約條文之未盡完備。亦與有關係。卽如盟約第十六條對於侵略者之制裁。本已明白規定。竟不能據以制裁日本。無他。遠東方面缺乏以實力擁護此一條文之國家。而「侵略者」三字之界說。復未經確切釐訂耳。蘇俄爲日本遠東之大敵。又爲首主規定「侵略者」界說之國家。故彼而加入國聯。當能增加國聯在遠東之力量。多少挽回日德退盟後之頽勢。</p>
<p>吾人苟不健忘。當能記憶前此軍縮會議開會時。蘇俄曾主規定「侵略者」</p>
<p>之界說。而其標凖則有五。（一）首先宣戰者。（二）不宣戰而以武力侵入他國領土者。（三）以海陸空軍轟炸他國之土地或他國之海軍及防空設備者。（四）在本國境内援助侵犯他國之武裝團體者。（五）海陸空軍未得他國之准許而通過或降落於其境内。者此種規定簡單明瞭。國聯盟約中苟早有類似之條文。則日本之侵略行爲。必無待於論辯而自明。而第十六條之適用。亦必不致爲人曲解而擱置。</p>
<p>去年七月二十三日蘇俄與阿富汗·愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞·波斯·波蘭·羅馬尼亞。及土耳其等國簽訂多邊不侵公約。亦相互承認上述「侵略國」之界說。近據歐電。蘇俄主張將此等界說。列入一種互相保障之公約。并以此事爲參加國聯之一條件。由是而觀。吾入且不問蘇俄之動機何在。其主張足以彌補國聯盟約中之缺憾。固無可疑。</p>
<p>然蘇俄加入國聯之困難。亦正在於是。蓋法國之拉攏蘇俄。無非欲對付勢力方張之德國耳。法於今日之歐洲。僅有實力薄弱之小恊約。爲之聲援。自非另結一强大之外援不可。故事實上自有聯俄之必要。至於蘇俄。一以受東方日本之威脅。二以有西方德國之伺隙。故亦欲聯法以自重。蓋非此無以分日德東西夾擊之勢也。法俄間之不侵條約雖經簽訂。而關於侵略定義。尚未及時加入。繼起而造成對於侵略者之共同陣綫。自爲兩國之大願。然此事果至實現。必難免他國之嫉視。其中最足注意者。尤爲英意之態度。英之於法。久已貌合神離。而時思有以削弱之。前此英國軍縮草案。所以許德增加軍備者。蓋欲籍此以减法國之勢。耳設法俄由不侵條約。更進一步。而訂結互障公約。自足增益法國之聲勢。而爲英人所不喜。今英國保守當報紙。對於此舉。已明白反對。其所持之理由凡二。（一）恐開罪日本。（二）英對中歐東歐。尚主修改現有和約。不應苟同於此種維持現狀之互障公約。英國保守當報紙之論調。常足代表倫敦政府之態度。於此可見英國朝野心理之一斑。意大利亦向主修改和約。德國向東南發展。固爲意人所不欲。然在共同對法之立塲上。則不惜同情於德。夫意人所以獨處於舉足輕重之地位者。厥因在法德對峙下。其勢力足以左右大局耳。今蘇俄提議之互障條約。顯然以德國爲主要之對象。意人自不願偏袒一方。以喪失其特殊地位也。他如向不承認蘇俄之比利時。瑞士。荷蘭。匈牙利。保加利亞及小恊約等國。能否同意於此種公約之訂立。以致搆成承認蘇俄之事實。亦在未定之天。依此而觀。蘇俄加入國聯。暗礁尚多。雖有法國之拉攏。恐亦未能輕易達到也。</p>

<p>天津通信、津市南開八里台日軍强佔地</p>
<p>畝、興築飛機塲一事、截至今日、猶在交</p>
<p>涉進行中、本月七日、津市府送致日領館</p>
<p>之抗議書、算至現在、將屆半月、日方始</p>
<p>終置諸不覆、致我方對日人態度、莫測高</p>
<p>深、交涉亦感覺無由入手、本月十七日、</p>
<p>市府依據省會公安局日來調查報告、復</p>
<p>爲第二次抗議、根據廣仁堂原租方契約、</p>
<p>叙明此事一切法律責任、由日方員、在</p>
<p>交涉未解决前、保留損害賠償要求權、省</p>
<p>會公安局則飭第二區警察置每日派幹練</p>
<p>警察、便衣梭巡於八里台附近、關於日人</p>
<p>進行工事情况、日有數次報告到局、由該</p>
<p>局轉報省市兩政府、至機塲墊土工程、已</p>

<p>川、何處張羅鉅欵、救此難民、前途殊爲可慮茲</p>
<p>摘錄官撫會派往廣元宣漢兩縣災區調查之報告</p>

<h3>廣元匪區調查報告</h3>
<p>廣元縣區被匪蹂躪情狀、據安</p>
<p>撫會調查員萬楚成龐明詩　度</p>
<p>調查報告、摘錄如下、（一）赤匪所</p>
<p>經、屠殺極重、計旺蒼壩附近屠</p>
<p>殺、有保衛局名册可查者、約一萬七千餘人、</p>
<p>四鄉屠殺、無可考查者、一百餘坑、約七八千人、</p>
<p>普子嶺殺二千餘人、木門殺三千一百餘人、長池</p>
<p>殺三萬餘人、羅家壩殺入百餘人、五郎廟殺三百</p>
<p>餘人、平河大河壩一帶、共殺九百餘人、琉璃寺</p>
<p>分水嶺共殺二百三十餘人、大雨會後壩塲殺一</p>
<p>百七十餘人、除南江轄之長池外、廣屬之五六七</p>
<p>八九各區、合計被匪屠殺、約三萬二千六百餘</p>
<p>人、至由廣元至南江沿途所見伏尸、動輒以萬數</p>
<p>計殺人一坑、半多活埋、婦尸則或背有小孩、或</p>
<p>懷有乳兒、大半皆以木棍塞入陰户、可謂極人間</p>
<p>之奇慘、普子嶺楊姓毛厠中、投入糼孩七十七八</p>
<p>人、皆二三歲、抱頭淹死、其中長池木門富户高</p>
<p>櫃米倉、則多滿貯人頭、凡此、皆共匪臨去時所</p>
<p>爲、至匪初到及去年殺人之跡、則因難民未歸、</p>
<p>尚未察出、恐一經細察、此一年中、枉死者尚不</p>
<p>止前電所陳十萬之數也、（二）各區民房被焚燬者、</p>
<p>約占二十分之一、拆毁者在十分之二以上、其餘</p>
<p>則窗户俱無、僅存四壁而已、（三）各區糧食、在匪</p>
<p>未退時、早已搬運凈盡、居留匪區之難民、尚有</p>
<p>升斗之餘、足以維持現狀、惟逃難回鄉者、顆粒</p>
<p>無存、實無法維持朝夕、人民多以嫩草野菜爲</p>
<p>食、卽穀種亦異常缺乏、多有身田已平、尚無穀</p>
<p>下種、縣府正趕運散發中、（四）各區被匪裹脅之</p>
<p>民、因軍方及政府寛大爲懷、不究旣往、最近由</p>
<p>南江前方逃回者、已有十之七八、（五）東路七八九</p>
<p>區、失陷最久、各地匪化亦深、蘇維埃之下有經</p>
<p>濟公社合作社等、惟匪任意屠殺、遂失人民同</p>
<p>情、（六）旺倉壩·普子嶺·眞武宮·廟兒灣·木門·分</p>
<p>水嶺·女郎廟·麻柳壩七區地段、雖經完全淪陷、</p>
<p>破壞蹂躪、所幸各地冬糧、全屬耕種、至今尚見</p>
<p>匪之「努力秋收、努力耕種」各項標語、可見糧食</p>
<p>耕種、亦爲匪所注重、故鮮荒土、不過當時人心</p>
<p>不安、耕作敷衍、其後軍匪衝擊、又怠灌漑、及時</p>
<p>雨一降、而苗草齊生、又有影響於收穫數量也、</p>
<p>但往歲種烟之地、約占全面積十分之一、今歲全</p>
<p>爲耕糧、挪移相補、或與常年無異、惟今靑黄不</p>
<p>接、刦後餘生、不免有懸釜斷炊之嘆云云、</p>
<h3>宣漢匪區調查報告</h3>
<p>宣漢調查員李舒揚林澤調查該</p>
<p>縣情形如下、（一）宣漢各塲事官</p>
<p>渡·廠溪·黄金口·蝦耕口·東昇</p>
<p>塲等地、官廠重淪於匪、居民流</p>
<p>徙甚多、東昇塲民生亦甚凋敝、然最慘者、莫如</p>
<p>黄金口、人民埋藏地下之穀米、得幸存者都鮮、</p>
<p>不惟此此也、豌豆油菜之巔苗、亦被搯盡、小春</p>
<p>收穫、大抵不過一成、現在軍隊難民、雖留住無</p>
<p>幾、災患聿除、而入民之餓死者、則日有所聞也、</p>
<p>胡家塲·毛壩·沿山塲·及鳴鼓塲·池溪塲·馬渡</p>
<p>關之░部地、經匪重陷、人民被殺者旣衆、逃亡</p>
<p>尤多、復以匪我兩方、兩月餘之主力軍激戰、伏</p>
<p>屍遍野、靑苗之被踐踏者、不可勝計、不惟流離</p>
<p>之子、多未歸家、卽團局亦尚未恢復、賸水殘山、</p>
<p>不堪寓目、將來救濟設施、非特别偏重之、則恐</p>
<p>不足以保存孑遺也、隘口以下各塲、雖有糧食缺</p>
<p>乏之憂、然收復已久、别無意外損失、拯救尚易</p>
<p>爲力（二）宣境穀種、多成問題、刻由辦理急賑各</p>
<p>員、隨地考查、對無力購運而又極乏稻種之各鎭</p>
<p>酌量情形、於所携急賑欵内、撥給補助、俾自辦</p>
<p>理、如其不足、得呈報回縣、再行添撥、雖不免粥</p>
<p>少僧多之憂、然於此經費困難當中、亦只有先救</p>
<p>下下急耳、（三）現在宣境各塲、瘟疫流行、西北兩</p>
<p>區、尤甚、詢問之餘、每塲病者以百計、十之八九</p>
<p>醫治無效、大抵八九日間、卽行死亡、診查結果、</p>
<p>腸窒扶斯佔十之八九、流行性感冒、佔十之二三</p>
<p>、治療俱甚困難、尤以腸窒扶斯爲甚、處此浩刦</p>
<p>之餘、錢藥兩空、深爲可慮、而腸窒扶斯之傳染</p>
<p>特性、其人愈强壯、則其受病愈易愈重、死亦愈</p>
<p>速、竊思農作之勞、力役之任、皆仰仗於壯年、今</p>
<p>罹匪禍之餘、壯年男丁、損失孔多、稼穡之事、泰</p>
<p>歸於健婦之身、重厄此疫、何以爲後、再則自</p>
<p>春俎夏、炎陽日增、傳染之勢、將有燎原之虞、欲</p>
<p>治不能、不救不可、是所憂也、惟祈呼籲省内外</p>
<p>醫藥慈善機關、派遣熱心明良之醫師、携帶大批</p>
<p>腸窒扶斯預防針藥、到處注射、未病者保其不病</p>
<p>、已病者或可不任其死亡、保全孑遺之功用亦偉</p>
<p>矣、查其傳染、由在飲食泉水之中、職等曾勸人</p>
<p>注意淸潔術生兼設葛蒲蒼术貫衆之根於飲水、</p>
<p>以滅殺病菌、然處此餬口不易之時、能行者有幾</p>
<p>、能信者者有幾、昌俱未可知也云云、（國聞社）</p>

<h3>日本空前大受賄案（日本通信）抛售股票起風波　現任財次被收押　政黨乘機取政權　軍閥借故張軍勢</h3>
<p>日本政治的腐敗、近來特别暴露得多、詐欺横領的事情、眞是層出不窮、不過案件的暴露、法院的檢舉、總是對卸任職官、現任官總還能勉强維持着顏面、卽今年六十五議會屢次引起的綱紀部題、牽連的兩位閣員、都沒有確實的證據、這一次就不同了、現任的財政次官黑田英雄、於五月十九日突被東京地方檢事局召喚、經審詢之後、卽行以凟職嫌疑起訴、并收容於市谷刑務所、</p>
<p>這次的大醜聞、和以前種種的醜聞關係不同、其涉及政府要人的内幕也兩樣、因爲這一件受賄案、是由金融界實業界重要人物很巧妙的作出來的欺詐取財案原來世界戰爭時代、日本的產業界乘勢猛進、神户的鈴木商店也是暴發户之一、及至　爭終結、在歐洲諸國恢復途中、日本還得了多少便宜、到昭和二年、（一九二七年）日本財政界發生恐慌、鈴木商店遂不能再支撑牠的空架子、而陷於沒落的悲運、而鈴木商店借台灣銀行的欵項特别多、鈴木商店倒台、台灣銀行差不多就要同牠一齊倒閉、但是日本政府爲了經營殖民地的關係、就不能不救濟台灣銀行、於是由日本銀行通融借給台銀的欵項實數有六億餘日金圓之多、那末、鈴木商店支配底下各種股票、都變作台銀押給日本銀行的抵押擔保品了、</p>
<p>帝國人造絹絲有限公司的股票、原來爲台銀所保持的、自那以後、也變作日本銀行的庫中物了、其數目計有二十二萬零五百十三股、抵押當時、一則因爲日本市面不好、再則因爲鈴木商店新倒、台銀信用不佳、所以該股票市價跌落到四十幾元、然而人造絲的市塲漸次良好、特别是日本製品消塲格外好、日本人造絲工業、遂一躍而登世界第五位、於是從前决定要縮短工作百分之三十的、到前年竟全部開工了、那末、帝國人造絹絲公司當然也不能例外、牠的股票、在市塲上也由四十幾圓、飛漲到一百五十圓左右、財政界的人、特别是和台灣銀行有關係的人都嚴节注目到存在日本銀行鐵櫃裏二十二萬多股的股票、去年一月、該項股票市價又跌落一百二十二圓上下、台灣銀行總經理島田茂、就與帝國人造絹絲公司董事河合良成·永野護等商議、如何從日本銀行把這些股票取出來、如何售出漁利、這就由島田向有關係的各方面運動、同時該項股票要取出來、非經財政部許可不可、所以次官黑田·與銀行局長大久保偵次都受了他們的運動、據說酬謝金至少有好幾十萬、結果賣出了該公司股票十萬股、當時賣價爲一百二十五圓、但須扣除佣金一圓及其他手續費三圓七十五錢、其後因該公司兩董事的提議、增加次本、合舊股三股爲新股兩股、并增加紅利分配同公司股票遂由一百二十二圓的市價、漲到一百五十圓、因股票漲價而得和利益有七百萬、因增加資本而得的利益有五百二十萬、合計起來有一千二百餘萬、這就是島田·河合·高木·他們一流人所朋分的利益、同時也就是台灣銀行的損失、</p>
<p>這事情在議會中曾發生過問題、那時候、次官黑田的答案、是說「台灣銀行作了一次折本的買賣」、就此勉强遮掩過去了他的醜惡、但是事實終於暴露了出來、台銀當事者旣被檢舉、黑田的黑幕也就同其揭穿了、這件案子、豈但是烘託出日本財政資本裏面的幾多醜惡、而且顯露出政治界綱紀的廢弛、因爲這是日本歷來所未有過的大案件、牽聯着財部、更不免會涉及現内閣、至少財長高橋不能辭其責、這正是政黨取政權的機緣、借此與超然内閣淸算、而聲勢張得最大·話說得最響·所採取的行動最激烈·終於要算軍部、牠雖未必就此奪得政權、却可以卑視一切、獨行其武力政策了、（五月二十日）</p>

<h3>洋米徵稅後國米銷路驟旺　兩粤尚難卽時時實現</h3>
<p>邇年國内產米各區、得以豐收、乃受洋米傾銷、以致榖賤傷農、本市爲運銷米糧之總樞、一般米商、亦多受洋米傾銷之影響　米業一蹶不振、政府方面、爲挽救米市復興農村起見、當經通飭各海口海關一律加徵洋米稅、中央社記者、昨晤本市米業鉅子顧馨一氏、詢以自徵收洋米稅後、國米銷售情形、據談甚詳、茲特分誌如上、</p>
<h3>洋米銷路見减</h3>
<p>據顧氏首稱、年來農村破產、業衰落、其最大原因、實爲洋米傾銷之故、近年來國内已得安定、農產品亦得豐收、但所產米糧、實不能與洋米相競爭、爰經各地農民米商、一再籲請政府、增收洋米稅、旋經財政部通飭各海關實行徵收以來、洋米卽不能若過去在國内傾銷、按現定洋米稅則　每石（卽一百五十斤）應徵國幣三元二角左右、洋米之價、當較國米爲貴、是故最近洋米已見减少、</p>
<h3>閩省徵稅情形</h3>
<p>顧氏復稱、現在華北以及江浙各海口、已十足徵收洋米稅、　故洋米進口日見减少、而國米銷路見旺、現在中央一方面謀運輸上之便利、及運價之减低、一方使各地雜捐槪予豁免、則國米銷售之前途、當可樂觀、惟福建事變時、國米幾不可問津、廣東廣西亦因未能開徵洋米稅、國米不能與洋米相競銷、故國米銷路殊無起色、自福建變亂戡平後、政府已凖備徵收洋米稅、但當時因地方初定、一切待理、未能卽時實行、本市米業界、一再呈請蔣委員長、迅予飭令閩省實行徵收洋米稅、該省業先依據財政部所定徵收洋米稅率之半數、徵收洋米稅、故於上數週内湖南蕪湖以及本市　在福建銷售之國米、平均每日在一萬包左右、如將來閩省能全數徵收後、則國米之銷售、當更有起色、</p>
<h3>兩粤難望實行</h3>
<p>至於兩粤徵收洋米稅一事、雖經蔣委員長一再與兩粤當局交換意見　以期早日實行、但以種種關係、未能卽時實現、按兩粤徵收米稅、向不由海關徵收　而由地方政府、另組機關徵收處、遇軍用米糧入口、且得以一律豁免、故該商人、有與軍人聯絡、用軍米之名、運入兩粤、以圖巨利、凡此均使國米不能在兩粤運銷之原因、蔣委</p>
<p>稅欵撥歸省用、但粤省當局、以洋米稅開徵後、則當將國米稅收一律豁免、俾得國米在兩粤暢銷、惟國米暢銷、則洋米勢難入口、而洋米稅之收入、勢必减少、對於地方收入當有影響、故此事在兩粤總難望其卽時實現也、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>怎樣增强記憶力　答翁達申君</h3>
<p>達申君來信、詢及「用怎樣的方法、才能使記憶力增强、」不致使「所讀的書、隔沒有兩三天，就忘得乾乾凈凈。」這問題，誠然是許多讀者引爲隱憂的問題。我們爲了破除讀者」「」</p>
<p>畏難」的心理，及提高他們的自信心起見，實有特别提出我們的意見之必要。</p>
<p>一般的說，記憶力不强，有着兩種原因：一是生理上的缺陷，卽是神經衰弱等，一是思想亂雜，不能集中注意力。關於前者，我們不想多所解釋，因爲這雖然絶不如一班宣敎師所說的那樣，是上帝的意旨，是上帝處罰犯罪者，特意造給那樣一付不健全的腦筋，但是這是關聯整個的社會問題，我們的生理上的缺陷，是我們的環境造成的，我們要補救這個缺陷，非從改良環境，着手不可，於是，說來就話長了。關於後者，却是我們現在所要討論的中心點。</p>
<p>我們的思想爲什麽會混亂不淸呢？我們爲什麽不能集中我們的注意力呢？原因很簡單，就是：一方面由於我們自己的意志不堅定，旣受不住五光十色的社會現象的誘惑，又無從尋出我們所應走的前路，於是，對於一切都似乎要嘗試一下，而結果對於一切都提不起興趣；另一方面，社會的混亂，引起生活的極度不安，我們時刻在和生活掙扎，試想，我們如何能輕易可以把心安放到書本上去？我們在小孩子的時候，無論對於書上的字義怎樣不了解，但讀過的書是不輕易忘記的，迨後，年歲愈大，思想愈複雜，而記憶力也愈漸薄弱。這事實，說明了記憶力，與思想發展的比例作用，同時說明了記憶在讀書的過程上，並不是佔着最主要的成份。</p>
<p>由於以上的說明，我們知到要增强記憶力，並不是有什麽「奪天地造化之功」的玄方法所能爲力，而應該從各人的實際條件的限制下求出它的切要的答案。</p>
<p>第一，我們在讀某一本書，或研究某一學科的時候，我們必定要有最大的决心，以全付精力去對付。當然，我們選定某書或某學科時，我們必須從自身，從社會的需要來决定，但决定後，我們於誦讀時便不要顧及其他。我們每天如果只有一點鐘時間讀書，那末，這一點鐘我們便應該全個身心都浸淫在書本内。我們不獨要眼到，而且要心到，對於每句每字，都不容輕易放過。（讀文學作品又當别論）西諺所云，「游戲時游戲，讀書時讀書」依然可以當作我們讀書的一句名言。</p>
<p>第二，所謂對於每字每句，都不輕易放過，絶不是要你每字每句都死板的記住，這是沒有用的，也是不可能的，如梁啓超那樣的「天才」還承認現在的學問，不是記憶的學問，卽是筆記的學問。我們的讀書，根本上便不需要「死記」，需要的是理解、是能融會貫通。所以在我們讀書的時候，我們應該行使種種方法力求對於書上任何部份的澈底了解。我們讀自然科學，必定要多找試騐的機會，多製標本，讀社會科學，必定要多觀察現實、多以現實問題來做例證，這樣，所讀的書，才不致生呑活吐，才能溶化在你的頭腦中，成爲你自己的東西。這樣，卽使對於文字，「不要兩三天，便忘得乾乾凈凈，」但那書内的精髓，却永遠忘掉不了。這道理，是極其顯而易見的。</p>
<p>第三，我們讀了某一學科的某一本書後，我們如果覺得對於書的内容尚不甚理解或者模糊不淸，我們可再讀立論相同的另一著作，以至第三本第四本。這樣有時是比重讀某一本書比較更有效的，兩個人偶然會過一兩面是很難記起，但見面次數一多，自然印象便要日見深切，不易消逝了。讀書也是這樣，在應用上，我們固應該多以實際問題應用到同一理論上來，而在研究上，參考互證，出是非常必要的，且爲增强記憶力的最好辦法。</p>
<p>總之，我們是認爲：一個人記憶力薄弱，是並不足以防礙其讀書的進步的，我們不僅從技術上可以得到補救，而且可以從别的路達到與記憶力强的人所能達到的相同的效果。我們不妨再三說，讀書不在「死記」，而在能溶化，能溶化才是眞正的記憶住了，最後，我們要申明的是，這裏所論的，是對讀一般的理論書而言，對於怎樣記英文單字或怎樣讀小說，等有機會時，當再另文論及。</p>

<p>會場瑣聞</p>
<h3>選手過磅難爲肚子</h3>
<p>男女田徑各項預複賽、各組運動員選出後、爲防制頂替起見、每於發現懷疑時、必須重行過磅、昨日男女選手過磅者甚多、有因一磅之差、取消資格、故各運動員咸有戒心、甚至减少飲食、以冀取巧、</p>

<h3>决賽景象</h3>
<p>（男甲百公尺）萬竹朱洪琪年靑力富、起步合法、衝刺得力、始終前導、尚文朱愛賢亦驃悍驚人、始終挨肩而上、高連寳爲和安名將、祇惜火氣未退、但亦能超崔廷芳而獲第三殊非易、此項成績十一秒五、中校聯運之十一秒八、由此黯然無色矣、</p>
<p>（男甲四百公尺）尚文多出項英雄在複賽時胡傅姚三劍客、已嶄然露頭角、號砲一聲、半程未達、馬道之上全見尚文旗幟、結果前三名爲尚文包辦、萬竹孫拚力奮鬥始得第四、　　（男甲鉛球）陶德生腕力强於餘子、三推之後、十四公尺○五之成績發現、打破上屆紀錄、華與陳　樑相差五寸而定乙丙、</p>
<p>（男甲跳高）績一公尺五八、破上屆紀錄、此項創造者爲高橋孫德寳、關於跳的姿勢、亦甚可觀、</p>
<p>（女甲五十分尺）西成梁志麟爲短跑奇材、其衝刺與邁進、殊爲餘子所不及、槍證之後、猶之脫韁怒馬、勇往無前、務本張益桂鄧國仙江菊才等諸小將、窮追不及、此項成績七秒八、較中校聯運之八秒一、可見生色、</p>
<p>（女甲百公尺）梁士麟女士殊獨霸兩項短跑之雄心、發步而後、務本鄧國仙卽落後一尺、五十公尺以後、並曫疾馳、八十公尺後、梁氏確已過鄧氏　胸、直達終點時、張益桂張素華、挨肩過線、裁判員目迷五色、竟有不辨風塵之感、結果判定鄧國仙爲第一、於是梁寃憤難伸、付諸一哭、此項成績爲十四秒六、（破上屆）</p>
<p>（男乙丙百公尺）男乙首席本爲虹路顧學詩所佔、不科體重超過法定磅數而被黜、深爲可惜、周再興由亞元而平添冠軍、其喜可知矣男丙、百公尺、萬竹談紀鎬、人小膽大、造成十三秒八之成績、尚屬可觀、</p>
<p>（男乙丙跳高）顧學詩旣不容百公尺、一腔寃苦、無容發洩、乃完全施諸跳高一項、以求名登虎標、果然有志事成、以一公尺三七五穩占鰲頭、丙組談紀鎬得百公尺冠軍後、躊躇滿志、宜其一躍而執丙組霸權、</p>
<p>（女乙五十公尺）務本徐錦秀較甲組梁志麟尤見可愛、五十公尺决賽之成績爲七秒四、超過甲組、金小菊衝刺頗見可靠、惜乎用不値時、良用惋惜、朱訪梅之姿勢、有粤省女將張潔瓊意味、苟能假以時日、上駟材也、</p>
<p>（女乙百公尺）冠軍亦屬務本徐錦秀成績十四秒四、破上屆、超甲組、平中聯、光華燦爛一時無兩、唯比賽時朱訪梅妹妹與萬竹金小菊競爭亞軍極烈、步伐一致、難見雌雄、到達終點裁判頗費安排、集議良久、姑定甲乙、曾引起糾紛、幸不久卽經人解釋、誤會乃始冰化、</p>

<h3>有光電話TelePhotoPhony</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>第一圖第二圖</p>
<p>「有光電話」這新奇的名詞，讀者有些不解罷！今祗聞見電話分有綫電話與無綫電話二種，而未聞見有光電話的，有光電話　是怎樣的電話呢，牠的原理，就是應用有聲電影而成的　使遙隔的兩處，在空間通信，將言語的音波載於光綫的光波上，將此由音波而愛光波的光綫射入於另一方的光電管，（ｐｈｏｔｏＥｌｅｃｔｒｉｃＣｅｌｌ）因音流强弱，光綫亦隨之有强弱，光電管接受强弱的射光，以致連接於光電管的電路内電流亦起强弱變化，乃經擴大器擴大後，變成强大成音電流，輸入擴聲器，能放原處來的聲浪。</p>
<p>有光電話中最緊要的問題是調光法，卽將音波寄存於光綫上，今所介紹的調光話是最簡單而有效的·請視第一圖的有光電話輸送興收受圖角當送話者向話筒講話時，音流經輸八放大器而擴大至放聲器；此放聲器與普通不同的，普通放聲器利用其放音，此處利用其銜鐵（Ａｒｍｓｔｕｒｅ）振動，以控制光門的光度强弱，使由光源經凝集透鏡射來的光綫，起强弱的費化，將音波變成光波的作用；乃由透鏡或抛弧鏡依距離遠近，將此光綫集射於光電管上；光電管接在靈感高放的成音週率擴大器（第二圖）變成音波電流，輸入擴聲器，卽放原處來的言語了。</p>
<p>光源可用直流的炭弧燈或汽車，小電泡供給之，使光集合於光門上，以待調幅在適宜的距離内，調幅後光綫不必需反軃器，可直射於光電管，塞頓博士（Ｄｒ·Ｒ·Ｍ·Ｓｕｔｔｏｎ）曾試騐不用任何透鏡反射器，將光門經調幅後的光綫直射於一千呎外之光電管上，故若在收受一方，將透镜與抛弧形反射體的改良，使距離增長數哩，亦非難事啦。</p>
<p>據實騐結果，在演講室中，光源用普通汽車小電泡已適合於輸送强大晉號自室一端而至他端：其間距離爲一百呎餘塞頓博士曾利用日光作光源，用集光定向器與透鏡，日光直射於光門，以供應用。</p>
<h3>如何改進一架收音機—換用五極高放眞空管</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>若以新式五極射電週率放大眞空管以代換一架收音機中之四極簾柵式射電週率放大眞空管，則此架收音機之成績必有顯著之進步。如原用３５式或２４Ａ式者，可換以５８式者；３２式者可換以３４式；３５式者可換以７８式者。換時，甚爲簡單，並無困難之處；稍有收音機製作經騐者，必優爲之。今因交流书音機用者較多，故以５８式者爲例，述其換法如上。至３４式及７６式者，依此率推。　　甲圖爲一級用２４Ａ式之射電週率放大，乙圖爲用５８式者。觀此二圖，其異點僅乙圖多一線自陰極接至抑制柵極（Ｓｕｐｐｒｅｓｏｒｇｉｒｌ）而已。故換時只須將原來之五脚燈座換以六脚者。另外照圖加換一自陰極至抑制柵極之綫：並將原來２３Ａ所用之一千五百歐姆之耗阻，換以三百歐姆者。（此耗阻之歐姆數，乃指每一眞空管用一耗阻而言）照此改換後，或致振盪時發生困難；則將５８眞空管所接之簾柵電壓略爲减小卽可免除。　　用五極射電週率放大管之利益，除電壓放大能力較高外（屏壓同爲二五○弗打時，５８式之電壓放大係數大於２４Ａ式者一倍以上）；且能收受較高之訊號電壓而不至過載，因其有抑制柵極可避免第二次放軃（ＳｅｃｏｎｄａｒｙＥｍｉｓｓｉｏｎ）</p>
<p>也。</p>
<h3>８６５介紹最新式省電眞空管ｉＡ６製單管外差式直流收音機</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>ＩＡ６眞空管爲邇來最新式省電眞空管之　種，其内部含有五個柵極，故名五柵變換眞空管，ＰｅｎｔａｇｒｉｄＣｏｎｖｒｔｅｒ），其絲極電壓爲二·一五弗打，電流爲百分之六安培，燈座共有六孔，眞空管上面有一槅極帽（見第二圖），該眞空管頗宜外差式收音機之需，因一管可兼任檢波振盪等工作故也，其成績之優越非其他眞空管所能及。第一圖係得用該眞空管作外差式收音機最簡便之一種，第一級檢波與振盪皆由ＩＺ６所擔任，再以礦石（化合炭式）作成音週率第二級檢波，使由天綫傳來之電波率，與本身振盪級發出之週率互騐，而成就一種新週率，但該週率較高週率爲低，而較低週率爲高，故名中間週率，該機以取１７５ＫＣ爲最合宜，因１７５ＫＣ間之副波長較其他地位爲少也，第一Ｌ圖中４Ｌ５爲１７５ＫＣ中間週率變壓器，其誘導力須配得適宜正確，否則振盪難以平穩，該機眞空管最好用一隔離罩，以避免雜聲與阻止（ｌｎｔｅｒｓｔａｔｅ）回輸率，機中各綫圈尤宜注意須排成直角，勿使有互誘作用，一切另件數値槪述於左。</p>
<p>Ｌ，以三十二號漆包線在一又四分之一徑膠管上繞念圈，Ｌ１以同號線距離２四分之一時繞一百二十圈，ＬＬ以三十六號漆包綫在一又四分之一吋徑膠管上繞三十二圈，在該綫圈繞就後在外週隔一絶緣物，繞Ｌ３在上面九十圈，Ｌ４Ｌ５爲中間週率變壓器，Ｃ爲·○○○三五兆分拉特可變電容器，ＣＩ爲○·一兆分法特固定電容器Ｃ２同Ｃ，Ｃ３爲○○○一兆分特拉特固定電容器，Ｃ４同Ｃ，Ｃ５同ＣＩ，Ｃ６同Ｃ，Ｃ７爲，○○○五兆分法拉特可變電容器，Ｃ８爲·○○○一兆分法拉特固定電容器，Ｒ爲四五○歐姆固定耗阻器，ＲＩ爲一兆歐姆因定柵漏，Ｒ２爲三十二歐姆可變燈絲耗阻器，Ｒ３爲三三○○○○歐姆固定耗阻器，ＣＤ爲靈敏化合炭式礦石：</p>
<h3>新式眞空管省電單管機</h3>
<p>— 思廉</p>
<p>中國江浙幾省的對餘家或聽衆們，備有單管機的，也不在少數，並且眞空管大都用省電式者，如１ｏ９，－９９，－３０等在入揚聲器時，終嫌太輕就是用强力式眞空管，亦不甚滿意，因爲祇有檢波而沒有放大。現在有了複作用眞空管，這問題就可解决。下面是單管機綫路圖，眞空管爲ＩＡ６五柵變換式（ＰｅｎｔａｇｒｉｄｓＣｏｎｖｅｒｔｅｒ）亦一省電眞空管，絲壓爲二伏脫，絲極電流爲·○六安培，與－３０式相同，ＬＬＩＬ２爲普通三回路綫圈，Ｃ爲·○○○四六ＭＦＤ可變儲電器，柵漏Ｒ爲２ｍｅ，ｇＣＩ·爲·０００２５ｍｆｄＣ　爲·００２ｍｆｄ，ＲＩ爲３００００ｈｍＳ，Ｃ２Ｍ·Ｆ·Ｄ·，Ｆ爲３２／１１低週率變壓器，ＲＦＣ爲８５ＭＨ，二電爲四個半弗打。此機以上半部作一級檢波，而以下半部作一級放太，故音量極響。</p>
<h3>内外消息</h3>
<p>美國無綫電公司獨家經理之史德華收音機，品質堅固，其特點卽雖天親炎熱，其他收音機易受天電擾擾，致收音不靈便者，惟該機則可無天電接亂，收音仍遙遠而淸晣，售價特别克己，誠價廉物美之收音機也。又該公司新到各無綫電另件，如電阻，方棚，電附等，均來路原配，有須購辦者，請卽臨南京路八十二號該公司可也。</p>
<p>中雍無綫電修理部新向美國Ｑｕａｒｔｏ）廠定到大批修理儀器，此種新式儀器，爲上海從未有過之修理儀器，不論何種收音機，一經校騐，立可指出，故工作可精美迅速，所配之另件，均向歐美直接定來，故收費非常低廉，諸君如有收音機損壞，只須電話通知，該處當卽派技師至尊府檢查，不收檢查費，如委託修理者，並可借機一具，免諸君所愛聽之節目，有所遺漏，修理完好後，並可保證，洵可稱上海服務週到，設備完美之修理部也。</p>
<p>修理無綫電特訊上海南京路廿四號亞達分司無綫電修理部，凡全國無綫電界同志，靡不熟悉，聞近來修理工作，更形忙碌，有增加人才，擴充地位之必要。該公司正計畫添設全埠修理分站十二處，不日實行。並擬委託長江各埠代理處，歡迎索閱詳章云。據悉該公司收到遠埠送來修理之無綫電機，有雲南郵政局，江西公安局，以及厦門福州漢口長沙重慶山西等處，可稱無遠弗屆云。該公司又自今春添設無綫電製造部以來，所接定造機件，異常擁擠。該公司出品，如大小各種電力播音臺，中波無綫電話機，短波輕便發報機等，俱有獨到之處，爲普通出品所不及。而價目低廉，服務週到，尤爲特色云。</p>
<p>唱片廣播之統計據英國之統計，唱片之用爲廣播者，占全廣播時百分之九，八，在意大利爲百分之一四·五，法國爲百分之二八·四，比國爲百分之三一·八，其最多者當推荷蘭，爲百分之四四·四，按荷蘭無綫電總會之統計，認此指數殊爲過多云。（飛利浦社）</p>
<p>天耳無綫電公悮近訊該公司近到大批增你智收音機，此機品質高貴，堅固異常，該公司並備有原配零伯，修理非常迅速，凡於霪雨時期，收音機需修理者，可逕送什配路該公司可也。</p>
<p>意大利巡艦Ｎａｇａ所有之落地收音機在日本時損壞，當地竟無能爲之修復者，到申後，送至南京路四十九號大上海無綫電機公司修理，結果甚爲滿意。又有美國水兵名ＡＥＯＸ者，道經小呂宋其所有鷹王牌六燈機，無故損壞，當地技師，再三查騐，不知病之所在，是以無從修復，一抵滬上，卽送至大上海無綫電機公司修理，亦經滿意而去。上述二端，均有物主書面證明，其事雖小，亦可見該公司技師之精良，而爲我華人略略吐氣也。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因爲中國人有許多的傳說，是講神仙的故事的，而在這些故事裏面，神仙所騎的代步的東西，往往是「鶴。」於是鶴也變爲一種仙物了。並且因爲鶴的壽命比較長一些，所以特地請它來提任「八寳」中的寳，作爲「生不老」的表徵。當它繡在鸞輿裏所幔着的那幅黄緞的上面時，它的身子。是純白色，而它的頭頂是朱紅色；這樣濃艶的色調，眞是美麗得不能形容了！</p>
<p>（靈芝）這靈芝究竟是怎樣的一種東西，實在無從解說，也許世界上根本就沒有這種東西！我所能說明的，祇是「一種菌類植物。」它的意義是祥瑞和權威的表現。那時候太后還在攝政，伊就等於天子一樣，整個的中國，全籠罩在伊的權威之下，那末就說這種靈芝是代表伊的權威的東西，亦無不可。它們的顏色是深綠的，和老的冬靑葉相彷彿。</p>
<p>（七）磬磬也是中國古代樂器中的一種。它是一個缺口的三角形，像「人」字差不多。敲起來用一根很細的木梗，木梗頭上裝着一顆像算盤子似的東西。但是敲的人不能用力過大必須輕輕的敲，才能發出一種淸越而温和的聲音來；雜在許多樂器裏頭，聽去是很美妙的！至於它何以會列「八寳」之一，那可考究不出來了。它在黄緞上所繡出來的顏色是白玉色的，可算是「八寳」中最單純的一種。（四三）</p>
<h3>手帕革命</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>手帕的用途，是用以拂拭涕淚，也可用爲人身上的裝飾品，這是一般人所公認的。最顯著的例，當推穿西裝者身上的三種手帕。袴袋裏的那一條，是拂拭手面用的。背後袴袋裏的那一條，是包藏痰涕用的。至於胸口袋裏的那一條，那完全是裝飾性質的。</p>
<p>至於婦女手中的手帕，那幾乎可說十條中，有九條是當作裝飾品用的。因爲婦女手臉上都搽了粉，自然是不容瀋滲汗液的所有的實際用途，就不過是拂拭淸瑩潔凈的淚珠而已。</p>
<p>因此，我以爲手帕的形式，不該一成不變的用完全直綫組成的四方形，而該迎合着潮流，各自别出心裁地，裁成圓形的，半圓形的，椭圓形的，三角的，六角的，花形的，葉形的，或其他各種的形狀。因爲在這年頭兒，手帕的用途，是偏重於裝飾用。裝飾用的，自然該趨於新奇。惟新奇，乃能合於時代。</p>
<p>若是研究新裝的藝術家們，眞肯提倡手帕革命的話，我想，不只在形式上，起了大變動，就是在經濟方面說來，也是很合理的，因爲手帕的形體，不拘限於四等邊形的，那麽，不拘是狹長的，三角形的，或是不成形的零頭料，都是很好的手帕材料呀。</p>
<p>至於新式手帕，在實際功用上，拂汗承痰，是不受影響的。</p>
<h3>賣解者</h3>
<p>— 馬嬰</p>
<p>鄉村的街上眞靜啦！店舖裏的夥計們在打盹。街上寥寥的幾個行人，也都默不作聲。一條很大的黑狗，睡在一家的屋簷下，像在做着什麽怪夢，聳起的耳朶忽然抖動了兩下。</p>
<p>前面曠塲上，像發生了什麽事，許多人圍着，嚷着。不好！准是什麽人又給土匪幹了呀！我在心裏呌，近來鄉村裏不太平，時常有暗殺案件發生；可是從來沒捉住過兇手一次，聽說都是近山的土匪幹的事，所以沒人敢去捉他。</p>
<p>到了近前，才知道我想錯了；原來是一批江湖上的賣解者。四週用白布圍住，有一扇布門，兩個戴氈帽穿短裝的人站在門口，臉上堆滿了笑，嘴裏哇呀哇呀的不知在說什麽。許多人圍在布牆外面，大人們伸手在袋裏摸銅子，小孩子在大人腿縫間鑽來鑽去。</p>
<p>裏面鑼鼓聲忽然嚮起來，那兩個戴氈帽穿短裝的人把布門一撩，喊着：「看呀！刮刮呌！」許多人瘋狂似的湧到門口，裏面一個紅衣女子騎着一匹烈火似的大馬，箭一樣掠過門口，立刻布門又掩閉了，兩個人又嚷：「一個客人十個銅子。」那姑娘眞美哪，紅衣裳，紅得像桃花。我摸出十個銅子，從布門裏走進去。</p>
<p>跑來，跑去，儘着兜圈子，一匹馬，一個姑娘。</p>
<p>起先還想等一會就有新花樣出來，可是我足站了一個鐘頭，還是那一匹馬，一個姑娘，儘着兜圈子。</p>
<p>回去啦！老站在這裏也乏味，不如回家去咬蘿蔔乾，鹹浸浸的，怪有味兒的！一轉身，便跟着幾個人出了布圍，外面的人，瞧着我們笑啦。</p>
<h3>玩弄</h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>有人說，跳舞塲裏的舞女，把衣裳脫得薄薄地，裸着粉臂酥胸，盡態極妍，是供給男子的欣賞玩弄，的確，當伊被一個男子摟着，在光滑的地板上，在音樂的節奏中顫動着，無疑地，伊是一架有生命的玩具，這樣看來，舞女是被男子玩弄了。</p>
<p>但是，反過來想一想，有許多靑年，都爲着伊們的色和肉的誘惑，而致迷戀昏沉，荒事廢業，把血汗換來的金錢，去買那一瞬的媚笑，等到你金盡囊空，債台高築時，伊的誘人的色和肉，又送給另一個男子了，使你神魂顚倒，懊喪竟日，你的生命總逃不出伊的掌握，結果，有的墮落了，有的自殺了，這樣看來，許多靑年，都不斷地在被伊們玩弄着。</p>
<p>啊！繁亂的社會，神秘的舞塲，究竟是誰玩弄了誰，倒底是男人玩弄了女人，還是女人玩弄了男人？寫到這裏，我也實在難以判判斷。</p>
<p>聽說梅花歌舞劇團的新創作「玩弄，」對本題有細膩的描寫和銳利的判斷，確是中國自有歌舞以來，絶大的收獲，在意識方面，技巧方面，都可謂成功之作，對本題有興趣的曁友，請注意玩弄的開演吧。</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>春申君廟</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>「浦以姓名傳，吾不爲魚終古賴」。</p>
<p>上海在戰國時，原是楚相春申君黄歇封邑。浦江卽相傳爲黄歇所鑿，因爲當時治水松江，要導流入海，所以開掘了這條水道，後來便因黄歇的姓而名爲黄浦江，亦稱黄歇浦，又稱春申浦，或稱春申江。於是上海乃有春申江的别稱，或竟簡稱申江。</p>
<p>流域達二百五十里，逶迤入海的黄浦江，對於上海生民，不論農田水利交通和商業方面的貢獻，都是非常巨大。上海人士對於春申君自然感謝不淺，要立廟致祭的了。况且在太平天國時代，浦西有警，百姓便逃往浦東，浦東失陷，百姓又避到浦西，賴有江水的阻隔，全活生命不少，所以後人有「一水賢於十萬兵」的稱頌，歌功頌德，不但牲醴致祭，並且竟形之於歌詠了。可是那個春秋祭祀的春申君廟，爲的屢經變遷的緣故，現在一般老上海也有點模糊不淸了。研究上海租界的人，看到上海洋涇浜北首租界章程第一欵内，關於不受工部局管轄的條文下，有春申君廟在内，就要發生疑問，要問：春申君廟究竟是在那兒呢？</p>
<p>現在我們就來談談春申君廟，想也非無益的吧。</p>
<p>春申君廟原來就是三茅閣。王韜的瀛壖雜志卷二裏說：「三茅閣在北門外，其側向有春申侯祠，卽邑志所謂延眞觀也。土人呼爲長人司。司神無可考證，俗因以春申君當之，春秋致祭維虔······」可知三茅閣側的延眞觀就是春申君廟。三茅閣建自一四○八年（明永樂六年）地爲唐姓所捐，内祀三茅眞君，故名。至一八○二年（嘉慶七年）由潘啓仁改建其東偏的斗閣，易名延眞觀，曹洪志爲之立碑撰記。後於一八五三年（咸豐三年）燬於兵，廟址又經西人租去，邑人於是移建於城内穿心街，專奉春申君，三茅眞君便被廢去。</p>
<p>我們現在從靜安寺路乘九路公共汽車，經洋涇浜到河南路口時，車上賣票的便要呌喊：「三茅閣橋到了！三茅閣橋到了！」這賣票的呌喊，就提醒你在這河南路相近的地段，便是那三茅閣的春申君廟所在之處，至於確實廟址，雖則遺跡難尋，但據葛元煦的滬游雜記上說：「春申侯祠在北門外三茅閣橋西北岸」，可見廟址一定是在洋涇浜的北岸，且在三茅閣橋的西北了。又據同書上說，在同治初年，洋涇浜河干，還有一座「春申古蹟」的牌坊，到了光緒初所連牌坊也不見其踪跡了，照此看來，春申君廟的地址，一定是在現時山東路以東，河南路以西，沿着愛多亞路北首的一帶地點，而靠近於河南路一邊，因爲上海縣志上明明載着三茅閣橋在三茅宮前的緣故。春申君廟旣在三茅閣的東邊，而橋又在閣的前面可見廟地不會很大，或者竟是一面臨着現在的河南路也未可知。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十九回</p>
<p>回柬足傷心自標獨活</p>
<p>聽鼙同歃血共誓精忠</p>
<p>甘太太說到這裏，不表下文，厚之心裏也就明白，這話就不便隨着向下說了。於是自扶起筷子來吃飯，並不作聲。甘太太笑道：二爺，你别嫌我作嫂子的喜歡翻舊案，以前我不是和你說過嗎，咱們那芳隣不是你的配偶，我可以和你另外找一個好的。可是你那時嫌爲嫂子的多事，很有個不以爲然在心裏。現在你對於這件事，大槪十分淸楚了，我就不妨再提起來。積之攔着笑道，得啦，嫂嫂，還提這件事作什麽？甘太太笑道，你别慌，我說的，不是過去的話了，提起來怪難爲情的，我還說什麽？我現在要說的就是我許的願，應該還願了，憑不你哥哥在這裏，能替我證明。厚之道，你說起話來，總不肯乾，脆，囉哩囉唆這一大套，我那裏明白？證明更是談不到。甘太太瞅了厚了一眼，笑道，這也不是你的什麽事，你瞎找急作什麽？我不是說過，二兄弟的婚事，自辦不成的話，我可以替他作媒嗎？現在就是時候了。於是向積之仰着臉道：我說的這位也是貧寒人家的，不過身分還有，他的確是位小姐，我覺得這種人最合於你的條件，因爲家境稍困難一點，家庭敎育，不見得就好。若要習慣户好，又知道吃苦，就非要這種人物不可。而且他還是個中學堂的學生呢，這比不以前你所選擇的人，要强過十倍嗎。積之笑道：嫂嫂說起話來，眞是呌人無從答復，一提起來便是這樣一大套。甘太太道：我當然得說這一大套，不說這多，你怎樣是明白。現在我問你，對那位已經死心了沒有？若是死心了，我這個媒人，就做得成功了（三九三）</p>

<h3>談長安</h3>
<p>— 竹逸</p>
<p>長安，這是怎樣富於詩意的一個名詞！</p>
<p>她曾經有過她光明燦爛</p>
<p>的時期，許多帝王在那裏曾演過種種壯烈的故事，許多詩人曾陶醉於她的懷抱中，甚至於現在稱覇東亞的日本，也曾經派人來吸收過她分發出來的香氣，那時的長安，眞是名震華夏了！然而，她現時是被了忘記了，好像一位失去了靑春的少婦，再也不會惹起人的留戀；然而，我是長安人，我始終愛着長安，我知道她的可愛處，也知道她的偉大處。</p>
<p>當你初次拜訪長安的時候，首先所感到的就是長安城垣的整齊與堅固，城垣長約四十餘里，高三丈六尺，寛三丈六尺。當你站在城根下，仰起頭來向上展望的時候，你就不得不驚歎牠的偉大了！在城内的西北角，還有一座小城，其大小僅及全城四分之一，淸時，那一帶地方是滿人集聚之所，當八國聯軍攻陷北京時；慈禧太后逃到長安，將這座小城作爲臨時的避難所，故名曰「皇城」。辛亥革命後，滿人漸漸絶跡，漢人也不常進去，内邊便荒草蔓延，殘瓦堆積，偶然去遊一次，便會令人發生無窮的感想。十六年間，那地方突然顯耀起來了，常常有無數民衆在那裏舉行大會，喧騰着活躍的生命力，城牆便被染爲紅色，改名「紅城」。十七年後，城牆上的紅色被洗刷得乾乾凈凈的，又改名「新城」。此後，在那小城内便時常駐紥着軍隊、或設立着軍事機關，四門上都有兵土把守，内邊爲陰森森的空氣籠罩着，老百姓便永不能進去了，許多人還歎息着他們尚未觀賞過那座神奇的「太后石」呢！</p>
<p>長安城中的街道，從前完全是用石板舖成的，淸靜而莊嚴：但近年來，石板路已再不可見，却代以廣闊的沙士路，吹風時，沙土便到處瀰漫着，使長安减色不少！</p>
<p>城内東海角，是孔廟，廟宇宏大莊麗，有千餘年的古柏一百多株，四季都是碧綠的。在晴朗的天空下，金色的琉璃瓦便反射出燦爛的光煇，又好像無數小明星在那裏閃燦着。孔廟的　　緊連着「碑林」</p>
<p>，有石碑數百種，一行一行的排列着，魏，漢，唐各代的名碑，都在這個地方保藏着。</p>
<p>城外的景色，以城南一帶爲最佳。雖然在城東有「灞柳風雪」，「驪山晚照」，城北有「草灘烟霧」，城西有「咸陽古渡」，「阿房未央遺跡」諸勝景；然而，總不如城南景色之秀麗。城南除「曲江春水」，「雁塔晨鐘」諸勝地外，最好的景色還在終南山一帶，（終南山距城僅四十餘里）因爲有了終南山，沿山一帶的景色就特别佳妙了。當春夏二季時，各處的樹木葱鬱着，在樹叢深處，隱約可以看到一座一座的村落，有無數淸澈的溪流穿過村中，曲曲折折的流出村外，發出淙淙的聲音，音樂一般的。三月，當樊川一帶桃花盛開時，遠遠看來就好像一片燦爛的彩霞。樊川的南端，有一個小鈟，名杜曲鎭，那裏出有名酒一種，卽名杜曲酒，當日李白所嗜飲的就是這種酒。詩人杜甫與杜牧之，都嘗愛在這裏把杯徜徉。在牛頭寺旁，有杜字祠，就是爲紀念杜牧之而建立的。再向南去，地勢漸漸高了，風景也就更加幽麗起來，到此地，眞會令人俗念盡消，一塵不染。若是沿着那條曲折的太乙河，一直走進太乙谷，由太乙谷登臨南五臺，那才更令人滿意呢！所謂五臺者，就是有五個山峯，每個峯頂上都有一座廟宇。其所以名爲南五臺者，以别山西省之五臺山故。這裏雖莫有華山那樣的險峻，却也高得可以，站在淸凉臺上向北瞭望。可以看到長安城，如一小塊草蓆子，靜靜的鋪在大地上，渭水好像一條白帶子，由她的北邊繞過去，投入浩蕩的黄河裏···。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我的心已經飛回我那可愛的故鄉去了！</p>
<h3>「······」「囗囗囗囗」論補</h3>
<p>— 曼書</p>
<p>徐訏先生在「人間世」上，發表了這樣的題目的論。對於此道，我沒有那麽深造，但「愚者千慮，必且一得」，所以想來補一點、自然，淺薄是淺薄得多了。</p>
<p>「······」是洋貨，五四運動之後這才輸入的。先前林琴南先生譯小說時，夾注着「此語未完」的，便是這東西的翻譯。在洋書上，普通用六點，吝嗇的却只用三點。然而中國是「地大物博」的，同化之際，就漸漸的長起來，九點，十二點，以至幾十點；有一種大作家，則簡直至少點上三四行，以見其中的奥議，無窮無盡，實在不可以言語形容。讀者也大抵這樣想，有敢說覺不出其中的奥義的罷，寻便是低能兒。</p>
<p>然而歸根結蒂，也好像終於是安徒生童話裏的「皇帝的新衣」，其實是一無所有；不過須是孩子，纔會照實的大聲說出來。孩子不會看文學家的「創作」，於是在中國就沒有人來道破。但天氣是要冷的，光着身子不能整年在路上走，到底也得躱進宮裏去，連點幾行的妙文，近來也不大看見了。</p>
<p>「囗囗」是國貨，「穆天子傳」上就有這玩意兒，先生敎我說，是闕文。這闕文也閙過事，曾有人說「囗生垢，囗戕囗」的三個囗字，也是闕文，又給誰大駡了一頓。不過先前是只見於古人的著作裏的，無法可補，現在却見於今人的著作上了，欲補不能。到目前，則漸有代以「ＸＸ」的趨勢。這是從日本輸入的。這東西多，對於這著作的内容，我們便預覺其激烈。但是，其實有時也並不然。胡亂Ｘ牠幾行，印了出來，固可使讀者佩服作家之激烈，恨檢查員之峻嚴，但送檢之際，却又可使檢查員愛他的順從，許多話都不敢說，只Ｘ得這麽起勁。一學兩得，比點牠幾行更加巧妙了。中國正在排日，這一條錦囊妙計，或者不至於摹仿的罷。　　現在是什麽東西都要用錢買，自然也就都可以賣錢。但連「沒有東西」也可以賣錢，却未免有些出乎意表。不過，知道了這事以後，便明白造謠爲業，在現在也還要算是「貨眞價實，童叟無欺一的生活了。</p>
<h3>開除以後</h3>
<p>— 白燕</p>
<p>—父子生活寫照—</p>
<p>父親有些抑鬱地凝住兒子，微含着愠意；兒子默然坐在父親的對面，不時玩弄着甲爪。　　沉寂佔領了室内，祗微聞父親氣喘時吁吁細弱的呼吸。不多時，父親忽抖　着唇問：　　「學校怎麽將你開除了？」　　「我不是早你說了，怎麽」儘管問？」兒子心煩地答。　　「我總得問淸楚，我不信：因了病便被開除。」</p>
<p>「得啦！誰還騙你？學校定的規矩却不知講情理，你曠久了課，自然就要被開除。誰還問你爲什事曠課？」兒子憤憤地說。</p>
<p>父親搖了搖頭，長喟了一下。停一停，便顫抖着身軀立起了，微俯下頭，在室内往返迥旋地踱着。兒子的眼睛也隨着父親的背影轉動。</p>
<p>這樣地過了一　時，兒子感到有點無聊，便舉起茶杯。唇貼着杯口，慢慢地呷着白水。驀然把茶杯放下，撇過頭朝父親問：</p>
<p>「爸！你這次帶少多少錢來？」</p>
<p>「你問它做什麽？」父親愕然凝着兒子問。</p>
<p>「我還欠人一筆債」。兒子很自在地說。</p>
<p>「我這次只帶了五六十塊錢來。」父親輕語着。</p>
<p>「那末，爸就給我四十元吧！」</p>
<p>「我統給了你，我們回去的盤費呢？」</p>
<p>「爸總可有辦法想。」</p>
<p>「唔，你就拿三十元去吧！我二十多塊總得留。」說着。便顫着手從内衣袋裏摸出一綑鈔票，數了一紥給兒子，便又很謹愼地放入袋内。</p>
<p>兒子接了鈔票，便高興地立起了。</p>
<p>「爸！我去去就回來。」</p>
<p>說着便拉開門走出去。</p>
<p>「喂·你回不回旅館吃晚飯呢？」父親趕出房門只問。</p>
<p>「隨便。」</p>
<p>說畢，便頭也不回地怱怱的走了。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>兒子走在路上，便默默地籌畫着這三十元的用途：回力球塲？還是舞塲？這兩件事在他心中躊躇。沿着ＸＸ路走着，不覺會芳里又展佈在目前。於是他又憶起一個人來，彷彿那面影就在他腦際幌動。這人便是認爲最鍾情於他的一個女人。</p>
<p>「眞的，已有好久沒有看見伊利了。」他自語着。便不禁步入會芳里。在一幢小朱漆門的屋前停下。手輕擂着門環，不久，門便張開了。跟着一張很可愛的臉從伸了出來。</p>
<p>一啊！蜜士特張！好久不見了！」女人搶着握住他的手抖着；笑吟吟地望着他說。</p>
<p>「眞的好久不見了」！他忙笑着答。</p>
<p>「你爲什麽好久不上我這兒來玩呢？」</p>
<p>「功課忙啦！」</p>
<p>「你眞用功」。女人想了想便又笑着說：</p>
<p>「你眞來得巧，遲來一會我就出去了。我正苦着沒有伴我去買什物，你伴我去好嗎？」　　「可以，可以。」他凝着她笑說。</p>
<p>說完，女人便天眞地拉了他的手走出去。她母親蹌蹌踉踉從後面趕出來，說：</p>
<p>「你道女孩子呵！也不請張先生喝杯茶，便拉了人走。」　　「他不喝茶啦！」</p>
<p>女人掉過頭答着，便又笑迷迷地望着他笑。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ</p>
<p>他摟着女人一面談走着。女人在一家舖子前停下了。　　「你要買什麽？」</p>
<p>「自來水筆。」</p>
<p>「你不有一支麽？」</p>
<p>「那支掉了。」</p>
<p>說着他們便踏了進去。店夥殷勤地招呼着，將十幾種不同的自來水筆都攤在櫃上，讓主顧選擇。</p>
<p>「這一支自來水筆，女士們用最相宜。」店夥一面說，一面將那支粉紅色自來水筆持在手上較着。</p>
<p>「怎樣」？他凝着她問。</p>
<p>「不知道什麽價錢」？她低聲說。</p>
<p>「二十元打九折」。店夥忙搶着答。</p>
<p>，她凝着筆躊躇着不語。</p>
<p>「喜歡不喜啦」？他催問着。　於是她紐怩地　起脚尖。用嘴唇靠近他的耳旁。低聲說：　　「喜歡是喜歡，就是嫌價錢貴了些！我沒帶這多錢來」。</p>
<p>他聽後便笑了笑。隨卽摸出鈔票來代她付過了，又取過筆來代她插在襟上。復輕摟着她走出舖去。</p>
<p>「我們到什麽地方玩呢」？女人問。</p>
<p>「隨你便」！他微笑地答。　　「你常是說：「隨你便！隨你便」！大家都這麽說，不是玩不成了。」女人嬌嗔着說。</p>
<p>「我怕我提議的你不喜歡，所以才這麽說；旣這樣，那末我們先到卡爾登戲院去看跳舞，看完後，再到冠生園食晚飯。怎樣？」</p>
<p>女人立卽同意了，他們照着計劃進行着。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>父親孤獨地坐在旅館裏待着兒子回來。時間一秒秒地逝着，而兒子却始終沒見回來。到七點鐘時、父親飢得難受了，便獨自買了碗湯麵吃了。</p>
<p>到晚上九點鐘時，方見兒子拖着疲倦的步伐走進房。</p>
<p>「你怎麽這晚才回來？晚飯喫過麽？」父親關切地問。</p>
<p>「朋友留着喫過了」。兒子不經意地答。一面便走向椅子坐下了。</p>
<p>「錢還淸了麽」。</p>
<p>「還了」。</p>
<p>兒子彷彿不大高興和你親說話似的，常含着懶懶的味兒。父親以爲兒子疲倦了，便催着他上床睡了。</p>
<p>父親坐在兒子身旁，一面抽烟一面說：</p>
<p>「我想我們明天就回家去」。　　「爲什麽」？</p>
<p>「這裏生活實在太貴了，一碗麵要一角五分錢，在我們家裏祇要十五個銅子就够了」。</p>
<p>「呵」！</p>
<p>兒子漠然應了一聲、便將身軀翻向内、呼呼地睡着了。</p>
<h3>賣笑女</h3>
<p>— 侯汝華</p>
<p>輕輕撫着腿上的暗傷，</p>
<p>脚不敢大聲嘆息，</p>
<p>嘴唇邊的笑都凋謝了，</p>
<p>還要眼眼送着過街的行人。</p>
<h3>歌声雨声　声的交響樂</h3>
<h3>屍（五）</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>「你預備把的爹怎樣？」這時候徐大爺凖備將自己的臉往對方的拳頭上去凑一凑，提高了雌鷄喉嚨。</p>
<p>「干你爹的屁事！」拳頭向空中一揮，一個交差的架子挺在胸前。</p>
<p>瞧熱閙的，不，預備升第一把交椅的五大爺不由得放火說話了；</p>
<p>「朱二官成什麽樣子，徐大爺說的話都不聽？」</p>
<p>「哼·老子揍他·」朱二官把衣袖一捋「又不是死了他爹，哼！喊朱二官來，，咱老子沒有這」</p>
<p>樣便當！」</p>
<p>徐大爺並沒有保護他的臉袋、在好漢手下揍一拳，倒底不是十分吃虧的事。他心中更有比臉袋更重要的念頭、三十年來徐大爺的英名，或者同朱小全一同送到鬼門關去了。他也明　得王大爺的一把火想推他的第一把交椅，不過只能活在五家鎭上，以後還能搖搖擺擺到福興茶園來嗎？他的臉可以咬緊牙關受好漢的揍一拳，可不能受五家鎭比釘還利害的眼睛。徐大爺的額角上爬出一條條的蚯蚓，汗珠像福興茶園門前石塊上的濕氣一樣的淌着，伸出顫抖的手，掙着最後的氣；</p>
<p>「你不知道我徐大爺的利害！」</p>
<p>自己的手指沒有離開鼻尖，好漢的拳頭烏雲般的揍上來。</p>
<p>「　的徐大爺！」</p>
<p>徐大爺再嗅不出陰溝裏的臭味，周瑜歸天似的直躺下去。</p>
<p>你們要瞧瞧阿根嗎？他「呀」的一聲，脚下終於在汚泥上一淌，和徐大爺比一比長短騷亂在福興茶園裏。（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>死光</h3>
<p>— 姑射</p>
<p>據前日報載，德國現在離邊境三百基羅米達地方，皆築有死光根據地，二次大戰，將以死光决勝負。此項死光，其射程可達二百基羅米達，發出之死光，可逾及各處要害地點，如鐵路，公路，車站，要塞等，而每次發出死光，其破壞力可達數千平方米達，並謂死光彈重一百基羅格蘭姆，其中有爆炸物或瓦斯或燃燒化學品二十五基羅格蘭姆，於德國境内發射，可直達法國境内，一百五十至二百基羅米達云。這眞是一個可怕的記載。死光的發明，遠在前幾年，我們就聽見說過，現在竟應用於實際了。而且二次世界大戰，卽將以此决勝負。觀其所述破壞力之强，我們眞爲未來的世界，爲全人類擔憂。</p>
<p>科學的發明，原是有利於人類的，而現在却拿作殺人之用，我眞不知這科學的發明，於人類究竟有甚麽好處。然而，這决不是科學發明之過，而是人類錯用了這科學的發明。科學發明，儘多供獻於人類，同時牠也殘殺了許多人類。這是爲什麽呢？這是因爲先有專門殘殺人類的一類人存在，而不幸這科學的發明，又都被這一班人所把握在手裏，於是，人類慘殺人類的大慘劇，便不絶的一幕一幕發生了。不獨大慘劇要時刻發生，而且在平時，也在無聲無臭的大規模的，時時在進行着慘酷的殺人事業。這是一個多麽悲慘的世界呵。</p>
<p>世界上有多少人們，現在都瀕於饑餓寒冷垂死之境，世界上有多少精美的機器，可以製造衣服，麵包，耕種榖類，發展文化事業，促進人類知識之迅速向上，然而他們却把這些機器關閉着，不生產，寗願把大批牛油牛奶傾入海洋</p>
<p>些精美的機器拿來製造殺人的藥彈，烟火，以及死光之類，反團來把養活人的東西，變成殺人的東西。這是什麽緣故呢；人願大家仔細想想看。</p>
<p>把可以養活人的東西，反轉來變作殺人的東西，我候無論如何，這總是不合理的事情。事情原很明白，人原是爲要活才活着的，而現在有一班人硬要呌大家去死，這究竟是什麽道理？固然，他們也很能漂亮的說出；爲正義，爲人道，爲祖國，死是應該的。然而究竟應該不應該？殺人是否是正義，人道？大家去死，又究竟是爲着誰的祖國呢？</p>
<p>事情很悲慘，而也很有趣，大家去他細想想罷，这究竟是什麽道理？</p>
<h3>孩子的日記</h3>
<p>— 櫻櫻</p>
<p>好幾年前，爸爸的經濟破產了。</p>
<p>那時候我比現在更小，一切都不明白；在别人都愁急得够苦，我依舊還是滿充了快樂！整天的要玩，沒有半毫心事。</p>
<p>天眞勳滿了我純潔底心！</p>
<p>記得有一次，大約家裏眞沒有買米的錢，以一頓麵，作了一餐午飯的代替。</p>
<p>於是，我向着爸爸發了脾氣，</p>
<p>——爸爸，我們今天怎不吃飯？不好，那麵眞硬得難吃，又沒有蝦仁。</p>
<p>爸爸不響，也不回答我。祗徐徐地撫摸我頭髪；同時像有好多滴的淸水，流到我捧着碗的那個手背上，一陣刺進了肉裏。</p>
<p>我更賭氣，不要吃啦！把那碗麵旗「砰」的推開了。</p>
<p>這才看到爸爸眞個哭啦。那麽的傷心！</p>
<p>我想在爸跟前服罪！小小的心靈中懺悔着。</p>
<p>哥哥把我拉了去，在另一間房裏。　　——煌弟弟！你太忍心啦！把老人家的心，吹得更碎啦，我們窮哩，那能够吃蝦仁麵！</p>
<p>——哥哥騙我，以前我們不是老吃蝦仁麵？</p>
<p>我還是撓起了小嘴兒。</p>
<p>——那時候我們沒窮呢！說不定，我們過後依舊有得蝦仁麵吃；或許能吃着蝦仁更好吃的東西！好弟弟，那才要奮鬥呢。</p>
<p>以後，我慢慢地長大啦！一切的，都能明白？</p>
<p>爸爸年紀一年大上一年，再做不動什麽事情。自然囉，我們過着的生活，益發拮据了。</p>
<p>哥哥眞好！他向爸爸說；他雖不能賺多量的錢養家，可是他好寫稿！至少，每月的稿費收入，也能貼補些家庭中雜用。</p>
<p>這是指說貼補我們，不是他自己小家庭，因爲根本，哥哥還不曾娶得嫂嫂哩！</p>
<p>他更時常說。我們窮不打緊！祇要我們不求靠人家，也不向人借錢，全沒關係的。我們因爲奮鬥不過環境，終於這樣破產啦！但是，不要緊，在可能的範圍内，仍舊該奮鬥。</p>
<p>現在哥哥也有三四元錢一月的稿費收入，加上了薪俸。儘可够我們度日子！有時候爸爸也想另找事情做，哥哥定不肯！</p>
<p>他說，我們能度過苦日子，也算啦！要是待後能够再好上些，收入更多些，就一樣幸福了。</p>
<p>我打趣着哥！待後我們多的錢，可給我蝦仁吃；那大的蝦仁兒。爸爸的縐的臉孔上，露出了慈祥的微笑！</p>

<h3>兩重人格</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>凡人總有兩重人格，這大槪就是人之所以爲人的原故。兩重人格，在官界表現得最明顯。一位官員，他對於上司，是一樣態度：惶恐，卑屈，奉承；對於下屬，又是一樣態度：傲慢，鄙視，煩厭。因爲對於上司，他是上屬；對於下屬，他是上司。所以，對上司，要尊守下屬的儀容；對下屬，要保持上司的威風。聽說從前的人拍相，先將自己照下兩張，服飾態度各不同，然後合照爲一張，兩個自己卽或如賓主，或如主僕，名曰「二我圖」。但設若一個自己傲然地坐着，一個自己卑劣可憐地，向了坐着的那一個自己跪着的時候，名色就兩樣了：「求己圖」。這種照片，正是一個人兩重人格的表現。這是世界上任何最偉大的諷刺畫家也畫不出來的一幅極盡維妙維肖的諷刺畫。</p>
<p>兩重人格，正像一張紙的兩面，一面黑，一面白。這不獨官員有此態度，凡人無不有此特性。一個主人之對於他的奴僕，和對於自己的主人；一個債權者之對於他的欠債者，和對於自己的債權者，都一樣都着兩種不同的態度去應付他們。</p>
<p>爲什麽一個人會有兩種不同的人格呢？某倫理學家曾說，凡是人主，也容是變成奴隸。因爲他一面旣承認可做主人，一面就當然承認可做奴隷。所以威力一墮，就死心塌地，俯首帖耳於新主人之前。其實何必等待威力一墮，才肯死心塌地，俯首貼耳於新主人之前。在同一空間，同一地位權勢之下，他便可以一面做别的主人，一面做别人的奴隷了。人究意是偉大的。</p>
<p>無疑的，在現代社會想做一個人，非有兩重人格，很難以應付各方面的環境。必須具有兩重人格，才可以變成主人，也可以變成奴隷。居主人的地位，有主人神氣；處奴隷的地位，有奴隷的身分。因爲一個人，不能長爲人的主人，也不能長爲人的奴隷。而况，主人之上，又有主人；奴隷之下，又有奴隷。　　兩重人格，實在是很可寳貴的。但是現時人們駡人，却常要駡一聲：兩重人格。難道兩重人格是卑鄙的，下賤的？人應須保持一重人格？一重人格卽使是高尚的，要以此去應付幾種不同的環境，定然要感到許多困難。所以我想，駡人而要駡什麽兩重人格，實不成話。　　不過，兩重人格也太苦惱人了。譬如說，一個人對主人要表示一種態度，對僕人又要表示一種態度，這不很難嗎？倘是在兩個不同的環境中，還容易應付；若同時同地要應付一個主人，又要應付一個僕人，那就窮於施措了。要是對主人遇於卑屈，僕人在下，不免丢臉；要是對僕人過於傲慢，主人在上，有所忌畏。這眞苦煞人了。非手段高明者，實難以打開此難局。</p>
<p>然而聰明的人們一學也就會了！</p>
<h3>弗如意傳（十一）</h3>
<p>— 忘我</p>
<p>离婚贍養費</p>
<h3>談午睡</h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>入夏天時漸暖，晚上爬上板床，把脚完全伸出被外，心頭還是煩膩膩的，沒有一點凉爽氣，其實又並非火熱逼人，於是就每每展轉反側，熬了半夜還不能安然入睡。這種景象，我想誰都認爲是無聊吧。但我想有些人總能睡得貼服，譬如嬌娘兒挽在臂間，身靠身，頭交頭，是則雖然熱烘烘，也定能安睡夢圓。除非他她們故意尋開心，半夜裏還閙着無聊，則或然像是床褥上有針氈，他她們也就睡不着了。不過這又當别論。　　晚上雖然是睡不着，也正因爲是晚上睡不着，白天就瞌睡得死人。上午還勉强可以挨得過，中餐而後，則眞正是撑不起精神了。</p>
<p>我就是這麽着，旬日以來，午睡是成了安排好的日課，中飯用了，一切雜念俱靜，絶不似隔晚的胡思亂想，一個朝天倒上床，睡得最是安適。</p>
<p>憑經騐說，這種午睡的安適，要算是苦痛的人生中的「種無上的幸福，尤其我個人是這麽感覺着。晚上我是無論怎樣也不能安睡的，卽使是「睡季」的冬天。總有那麽多的心事來打擾，日間苦惱不盡，還得夜以相繼，惡夢的射擊，其痛苦實不敢當呵。</p>
<p>但是我得聲明，我之看重午睡，絲毫沒有妄想附驥幽默諸君子，而是庸人一點懶的經騐，這要算做例外。</p>
<p>不過站在另種意義說，午睡確比晚睡來得有生氣有意義，假使論語諸公不談幽默，僅談懶理，則我也得冐昧的參加一員。</p>
<p>我想在這世紀末的世界上，人是痛苦極了，痛苦到連晚上都睡不着，人生短短幾十年，若不從午睡中略尋些安慰，怎麽値得！</p>
<p>雖則是宰予晝寢，孔子駡他是朽木不可雕也，糞土之墻不可圬也，但到了幾千年後的今日，有人替他翻案伸寃，說孔子是不應該。黔人游翰明的「每餐未嘗過三碗，一睡就是大半天，」許多的正人君子必嗤爲世之廢物，但論語却彷彿引用過他爲同志，也自有道理在。　　不過，我也還有點經騐要說，午睡却好，却很有益，（但得鄭重申明，午睡絶無幽默可言）但亦不可睡得太久，恰恰十數分鐘，是最得當，至多也不能過半點鐘。倘若如游子之一睡就是大半天，則又殊有害於身體之健康也，是當特别留神。</p>
<p>時序遷移，春光一到，花香鳥語，大家都說好逛公園，我却死登在房裏，無以表示歡迎之意。今夏日又至，我依然生活得像沒有靈性的動物一般，僅僅就有午睡一項，或可略略表白我對於這時序的敬禮。</p>
<p>同志們，時候到了，我們是何等的需要午睡呵！睡吧！午睡吧</p>
<h3>科學靈乩</h3>
<p>— 岑樓</p>
<p>中國人的求神拜佛，程度也算够透頂了。結婚要占卜，出門要占卜，造房子要占卜，打墓地要占卜，做官要求神，養兒子要求神，發財要求神，以至於國難則要建道塲（據說日本之所以國運昌隆，就是因爲道塲建得多，建得得法，所以中國不得不仿照辦理云。）中國可說是以道塲，以求神拜佛，以占卜立國的國家。然而國家還總是不昌隆，一樣要「國疆日蹙三千里」，這不知究竟是什麽道理。而現在則又有　科學靈乩的發明了。靈乩而又加上科學，這還了得，當然，無疑義的，牠比時輪金剛法會效力還會大。我們祇要看牠的使用法，祗稍三個人撳着一個碟子，碟子便會動，而且能指字，這是一個多麽神奇而且便利的求神法呵。從此，人備一具，我根就足以打倒日本達姆達姆彈以及五右磅飛機炸彈而有餘。</p>
<p>老先生們或許也要嘆道：「國家將亡，必有妖孽」，這科學靈乩也可算是國家將亡時候的妖孽了。這話然而不然。科學靈乩自有牠一定的產生的社會原因的。這社會原因，便是農村破產，都市工業破產，整個國家，被帝國主義嚴重的摧殘，踐踏，一般小市民，望着前面，渺渺茫茫，毫無出路，經濟危機，特别利害的打擊了這一班人，沒有辦法，他祇有以幻想，空想來寛解自己，麻醉自己，並探求其萬不可得的出路。這便是科學靈乩所以能風行一時的由來了。科學靈乩的風行，原是與社會經濟基礎的瓦解以俱來的。大人们有時輪金剛法會，必然的，一般人—特别是小市民，便有科學靈乩。這是相映成趣，而有着一定的連帶關係的。</p>
<p>國家的危難，社會的破毁，到目前也可算是達到空前未有的程度了。然而中國人的求出路，却仍是不外乎求神拜佛的一套。我眞替大家傷心。我眞不信，大家眼前，竟是沒有一條可走的路。路，事實上未嘗沒有，很易走，很能走，而他們却不願意走，不能走。這就祗有决定他們這條悲慘的沒落的命運。然則，對於這班人，我們也沒有什麽可惜。一定的社會本質，决定了他們這樣一定的歸宿。事實上有什麽可惜呢？歷史是這樣安排着每一個人的下塲的。</p>
<p>去罷，你們這一班可憐的人們。科學靈乩安慰了你們，也將最後葬送了你們。歷史是最不容情的，誰沒落，牠就掃除了誰。在這時，你們是再也沒有徘徊觀望的餘地的了。</p>
<h3>還是忍耐些的好</h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>這次的遠東運動會，在菲開幕到今，差不多已經一星期多了；那些關心吾國選舉勝負的人們，天天在注意着各報上的馬尼剌電訊。總算恭喜，見今日大會閉幕揭示出來的成績是：吾國得了一個足球的冠軍，一個排球和籃球的亞軍，全數的總結算，吾國却榮居了第三位，這還沒有使國人完全失望！</p>
<p>記得女子的排球和籃球賽的結果，因裁判員的不公正而落了選；普並且，還說吾們的女選手違犯會章。後來女選手們都痛哭不止，因爲這是寃屈的啊！當時有一位滑稽的男選手對她們說：「你們哭什麽呢，這是運動呀！輸了有什麽稀罕；横竪吾國又沒有輸掉了什麽！他們的不公平也不能够怪。本來，吾國中國人，到處是應該吃虧些的。極大的國土還在拱手送給别人啦，隻把錦標是値得痛哭的嗎？吾請你們把這寳貴眼淚收藏起來，等到將來ＸＸ了再流吧！」這一夕話，眞是語語沉痛，句句刺心，毌怪某君說畢，自己倒也不自覺地流起淚來了。</p>
<p>雖然，關於這件事情，吾國代表也曾一度提出抗議，向菲方當局交涉，要求重賽。但結果，吾方因獲得了輿論的勝利（？）而將此項抗議，自動撤消了。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>不過，吾想事實上，卽使發了抗議，也不見得會有什麽效果的；現在這樣一來，倒是還算自己識相。</p>
<p>最後，日本代表忽然無端地提出了一個要求修改會章的無理條件。菲方也無理地接受了下來；絶不徵吾方同意，而擅將會章第十條修改，准許非會員國之參加。現在大會已宣告閉幕，在這不平等待遇之下，吾國代表只有無聲無氣的退席；同時並聲明「非法議决，吾誓不承認，」一塲遠運的軒然大波，便於此開始，但不知將來的結果怎樣？尚待於後證。但是吾們中國，處處受人壓迫，受人輕視，說來實在可痛！强權無公理，弱國無外交，在現實的世界上做人還有什麽理可講？祗須强横覇道了些，那麽一切都可佔上些便宜，只有傻子，才會去相信公理！這回遠運的糾紛，眞是小之又小的小事，它卽不涉國家大計，更不關外交的事情，何必大驚小怪，値得退席，吾有還是忍耐些的好，反正，吾們都是大量海涵的民族，决不會怪你們的。</p>
<h3>佛敎徒參加辱國大會</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>日前報載本埠訊：「本年七月下旬，日本佛敎靑年會，將在東京舉行第二次汛太平洋佛敎靑年會大會。其邀約之國家，公然列滿洲僞國第二，中國爲第三。又其籌備職員以中華班長藤井草宣，與滿洲班長小林啓善并舉，侮辱吾國，可謂無所不至，凡吾國人，當莫不憤怒而痛絶之。乃本月八日日本京都發行之中外日報登載，該會中華班長藤井報告，吾國佛敎徒竟有十餘人，受其勸誘自稱代表，决定赴會。」</p>
<p>吾國佛敎界素乏團結，以致少數敗類，自居代表，而妄有舉動，已成常事。但，此次日本開會，一方列入僞國傀儡，一方又誘惑吾國僧俗出席。務使吾國與傀儡發生關係，其用心之險惡，不堪聞問！乃常惺之昧於大體，妄行參加，欲與舉世不承認之僞國代表周旋一堂，自辱辱國，莫此爲甚；願吾國人一致設法阻止，實國家前途之幸也。</p>
<p>日本之對吾國侵略，常用不同之外交方式以行之；强迫利用，無微不至。前此之在滬組織國際產業觀光團，及不久在北平發起赴日觀光團等，亦無非係其陰謀手段之一種，奈吾國人見利忘義，竟自願去出賣其良心，人格；言之至可痛心！目前，中日之仇恨日深，感情亦日趨破裂；而彼渾慒之佛敎徒，尚甘心去與僞滿並列。此在日人看來，眞所謂「不怕魚兒不上鈎」矣。</p>
<h3>木香</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>我喜歡木香花。</p>
<p>本香雖沒有玫瑰那樣的鮮艶，却有玫瑰那樣的芬芳；牠雖沒有梅花那樣的淸奇，却有梅花那樣的純潔。我喜歡木香。</p>
<p>十年前，我家住在蘇州。出了很低的代價租到了一座私家的花園。在那裏有曲折的小徑，奇突的山石，淸漣的溪水，更多芬芳的花卉。木香花是最能引起我底興趨的一種。在一種木橋上有一架竹棚，那上　　　着一株木香。暮春時節，一點點的白色的花朶就會把那竹棚變成一個大花籃似的，蜂兒蝶兒老在那裏徘徊，我也常常把身子浸潤在那可愛的芬芳裏。我會倚在樹欄上呆呆地站上一二個鐘頭，有時我會受花的芬芳和蜂的嗡嗡聲催眠，就那末睡在橋上；每次總是被我的母親抱上床去。</p>
<p>那時候我是孤獨的，我沒有伴侶。那株可愛的木香祗有我去觀賞，更沒第二個人伴我同倚在橋欄上，同時蜂蝶的催眠。</p>
<p>那樣地過了二年。至第三度木香開放的時候，我終於有了兩個童伴：一個是同年紀的雲，還有一個是比我小三歲的雲的妹妹英。他們是我的同鄉，才從鄉下來到城市的，寄居在我的家中。我們天天在橋上花下做種種游戲。我不再孤獨地倚在橋欄上，我也不再受蜂蝶的催眠。</p>
<p>提起木香，我就會記起我額上的那塊小傷疤。有一次，英要我採棚上的木香，我採不到雲比我更矮。可是我不忍使英失望，就呌雲帮忙我扶上橋欄上去。當我一隻手剛碰到一叢可愛的木香時。我的脚一滑，就從半丈多高的橋上跌到池裏，頭在橋柱上碰出了血。結果被救了上來。我的手中還握着一朶木香。　　很奇怪的。從那次後我對於木香更增進了好感。</p>
<p>這並不是一幕戀愛的喜劇，那時候的年齡並沒到戀愛的程度，然而一想起了這回事，我便會愉快。也許是童年的往事値得回憶吧？也許純潔芬芳的木香値得留戀吧！</p>
<p>我總是愛着木香花。</p>

<h3>如熱鍋上的螞蟻一般</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>鄙人因家庭經濟困難，無力求學，只得到商店裏充學徒在店内服務，尚蒙店東靑睞。惟鎭日價做些無意義的事情，學識方面毫無增益，瞻念前途，不寒而慄。夫今文明之世，不有相當學識，怎能立足社會？因每想一面求學，一面服務。我曾將此意禀過家君，擬入商業學校補習，家君因這種學校學費不多，且喜我一片好學之心，極端贊許，卽與東翁相商，每日請假二小時，詎東翁非但不許，反大加申斥，說：「你旣要讀書，又何必出來學生意！」我們做學徒的，好比童養媳，那敢不從，只得作爲罷論。但我求學之心，如大旱之望雲霓，所以近日的我，如熱鍋内的螞蟻一般不知怎樣纔好。若說自己去練習吧，書本是不會說話的，不懂的地方，我問誰呢？若說棄商求學吧，則又被經濟所壓迫，沒有職業，吃飯成了問題。若說長此因循下去吧，精神上痛苦，實在難堪，進退兩難，我實在痛苦。素仰</p>
<p>編者先生是徘徊歧途的靑年的指導者，因此，冒昧懇請你來指示，敎我一個適當的辦法，我渴望着你能早日給我答覆。祝你</p>
<p>康健朱慶元鞠躬</p>
<p>答：接到你的來信，非常感慨，有機會讀書的人偏不讀書，沒有機會的人偏要讀書。你對於不能到學校去讀書，就認爲求學是絶望了，這一點我却大大以爲不然。前幾天我答覆少達君的問題時，就說過，一個人求學是不一定要進學校的。現在我再舉一個實例，你大槪可以相信了。商務印書館總理王雲五先生、這個人你大約知道的罷，他並沒有</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>進過什麽學校，起初進商務時，他和你一樣的是做學徒。他讀英文，並沒有進學校，完全靠自修，但到現在他却能很流利地做英文演講，（這是他自己說的）所以祗要有毅力，那個人不能自修，更那裏不能成功。你或許要說，這種話祗是說著好聽，沒有顧慮到你的困難，一書本是不會說話的，不懂的地方，我問誰呢」？不錯，初學的人常會如此，但你却不能因爲有些地方讀不懂，就灰心，你讀一遍不懂可讀兩遍，兩遍不懂三遍，終究你是會懂得的，不過較在學校讀書的人多花些時間罷了。再進一層說，讀書愈是經過自己苦心揣摩，得益愈大，印象愈深，在學校裏讀書的人，常有一種毛病，不懂的地方可問先生，自己就貪懶，不肯自己解决問題，因此，讀書都是不求甚解，所得的印象也很膚淺，隔了幾天依然還給先生，這是事實，你切莫以爲是空談。</p>
<p>讀書難以了解是自學的次要問題，這種困難總可克服的。初學的人最困苦的是，不知讀些什麽東西好，更不知讀那本書好，這種徬徨，沒有人指導，一定能使你多走寃枉路。爲此，本報流通圖書館現在設有「讀書指導」，專門帮助失學自修者解决問題，你可報名參加他們是能指導你怎樣自學的。</p>
<p>還有一層，我也要告訴你，讀書固然是好，但我們所以要讀書，是認識自己的生活，了解目前的環境，一言以蔽之，我們讀書，無非是求得些我們應付生活的知識和能力，我們並不是想做學者，充滿了一肚子的原理學識。所以我們不能讀許多書，並沒有什麽關係，也用不着傷心，在實際生活經騐中，我們也能達到我們讀書的目的。</p>
<p>朋友，提起勇氣來自學，努力克服自學的困難。我們做人，處世及解决一切問題，應當抱着這樣的宗旨，「除了死法想活法」這個辦法絶對不成功，另換一個辦法，這條路走不通，另走其他一條路，假如你刻板的去解决問題，到處都會感覺到你是走上了絶路，前途黑黯。總之，我們要做一椿事，總要先問在事實上可以辦到否，可以，不論如何困難都要做，不可以就接倒。這是做人的大道理，假如你能照着這方針做去，我敢說，一生受用不盡，你以爲如何？</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Joins the League of Nations and the Mutual Guarantee Convention Hinge</h3>
<p>Recently, due to France's vigorous efforts to court it, Soviet Russia has shown a considerable intention to join the League of Nations. If this move is realized, it would naturally somewhat salvage the prestige of the League of Nations, which has declined since the September 18th Incident. The weakness of the League of Nations lies in its own lack of strength, and the incomplete nature of the League Covenant is also related. For example, Article 16 of the Covenant clearly stipulates sanctions against aggressors, yet it could not be used to sanction Japan. This is because the Far East lacks a country with the strength to uphold this article, and the definition of the word "aggressor" has not been precisely defined. Soviet Russia is Japan's major enemy in the Far East and the first country to propose a definition of "aggressor." Therefore, its accession to the League of Nations should increase the League's power in the Far East and, to some extent, reverse the decline after Japan and Germany withdrew from the League.</p>
<p>If we are not forgetful, we should remember that when the previous Disarmament Conference was held, Soviet Russia took the lead in defining "aggressor," and its standards were fivefold: (1) Those who declare war first. (2) Those who invade the territory of another country by force without declaring war. (3) Those who use naval, land, or air forces to bomb the land of another country or the naval and air defense facilities of another country. (4) Those who assist armed groups that invade other countries within their own territory. (5) Those whose naval, land, or air forces pass through or land in the territory of another country without the permission of that country. This provision is simple and clear. If the League Covenant had similar provisions earlier, Japan's acts of aggression would have been self-evident without debate, and the application of Article 16 would not have been misinterpreted and shelved.</p>
<p>On July 23rd of last year, Soviet Russia signed a multilateral non-aggression pact with Afghanistan, Estonia, Latvia, Persia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey, and mutually recognized the above definition of "aggressor." According to recent European dispatches, Soviet Russia advocates incorporating these definitions into a mutual guarantee convention and making this a condition for joining the League of Nations. From this perspective, we will not even ask what Soviet Russia's motives are. There is no doubt that its proposal is sufficient to make up for the shortcomings in the League Covenant.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations lies precisely in this. France's courting of Soviet Russia is nothing more than an attempt to deal with the increasingly powerful Germany. In today's Europe, France only has the support of the Small Entente, which is weak in strength. Therefore, it must form another strong external alliance. In fact, there is a need to ally with Russia. As for Soviet Russia, it is threatened by Japan in the East and has Germany watching for opportunities in the West. Therefore, it also wants to ally with France to increase its own weight, because without this, it would not be able to disperse the situation of being attacked from both East and West by Japan and Germany. Although a non-aggression treaty between France and Russia has been signed, the definition of aggression has not yet been incorporated in time. The subsequent creation of a common front against aggressors is the great desire of both countries. However, if this matter is realized, it will inevitably be envied by other countries. The most noteworthy among them is the attitude of Britain and Italy. Britain has long been outwardly friendly but inwardly estranged from France and is constantly thinking of ways to weaken it. The reason why the previous British disarmament draft allowed Germany to increase its armaments was to reduce France's power. If France and Russia take a further step from the non-aggression treaty and conclude a mutual guarantee convention, it would naturally increase France's prestige, which would be disliked by the British. Now the British Conservative newspapers have clearly opposed this move. The reasons they hold are twofold: (1) Fearing to offend Japan. (2) Britain still advocates revising the existing treaties in Central and Eastern Europe and should not agree with this kind of mutual guarantee convention that maintains the status quo. The views of the British Conservative newspapers often represent the attitude of the London government. From this, one can see a glimpse of the psychology of the British government and public. Italy has also always advocated revising the treaties. Germany's eastward expansion is naturally undesirable for the Italians, but on the basis of jointly opposing France, it does not hesitate to sympathize with Germany. The reason why Italy is in a pivotal position is that under the confrontation between France and Germany, its power is sufficient to sway the overall situation. Now the mutual guarantee treaty proposed by Soviet Russia is clearly aimed primarily at Germany. The Italians naturally do not want to favor one side and lose their special position. As for Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Small Entente countries, which have never recognized Soviet Russia, whether they can agree to the conclusion of this kind of convention, so as to constitute the fact of recognizing Soviet Russia, is also uncertain. From this point of view, there are still many hidden reefs for Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations. Although there is France's courting, it may not be easily achieved.</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops to be Reduced in Strength; Anti-Japanese Organization on the Shenhai Railway</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet Manchukuo army has decided to implement a reduction in strength starting from July 1st. Each brigade will have two battalions cut, reorganized into one regiment of two battalions. Each battalion will have one company cut, reorganized into one battalion of three companies. This is the first step taken by the Japanese to eliminate the rebellious troops in the Northeast. Spies raised by the Japanese often travel between Tianjin and Changchun. There are also some dancing girls who work in Tianjin dance halls and also go to Changchun to be active. It is said that these dancing girls specialize in interacting with politicians staying in Tianjin to probe for military and political news in North China. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reports from the puppet side, there has been an active anti-Manchukuo and anti-Japanese organization near the area between Shanchengzhen and Liuhe County on the Shenhai Railway.

Several hundred men from the remnant forces of the righteous army led by Su Ziyu have established a government in the area, which has attracted the attention of the Japanese. The Japanese side has now sent investigators to search, intending to crack down on it as soon as possible. It is reported that this anti-Manchukuo and anti-Japanese group has a particularly meticulous organization and has a large number of righteous troops as support. If the Japanese investigation cannot get results, they will send a large force to encircle and suppress it. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Issue of Newly Organized Special Police Entering War Zone</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong spoke about the Japanese side restricting our newly organized special police from carrying machine guns into the war zone, which is an unreasonable demand.

The Japanese side wants us to change the method, placing the machine guns on the border of the war zone and then temporarily retrieving them when needed. How can we know when they will be needed? If the bandits swarm in and the police team is unable to resist and is defeated by the bandits, wouldn't it be too late to retrieve the machine guns to fight the enemy? As for the number of people, it is organized according to the number agreed upon in the Tanggu Truce. The Japanese side cannot quibble about this. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 25th, Yin Rugeng telegraphed the provincial government to report that the matter of the newly organized special police entering the war zone is under negotiation and may obtain the understanding of the Japanese side to carry machine guns into the war zone.

<h3>Luo Yunyan Suggests Convening a National Anti-Smoking Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Legislative Yuan member Luo Yunyan suggested that the central government convene a national anti-smoking conference to formulate unified anti-smoking measures as follows: 1. The national anti-smoking conference should be convened by the national government, with the chairman of the national government, the president of the Executive Yuan, the president of the Legislative Yuan, and the chairman of the Military Affairs Commission forming a presidium, rotating chairmanship. 2. In addition to the military and civilian leaders of each province, the attendees should also include one representative from each statutory organization in each provincial capital and special municipality, as well as several experts. 3. The duration of the conference is tentatively set at ten days, and it may be extended if necessary. 4. All resolutions and promulgated anti-smoking laws should be uniformly executed by the Central Anti-Smoking Commission, so as to avoid the bad habit of each doing things in its own way. 5. The Central Opium Suppression Committee should be reorganized into a standing committee system, with the president of the Executive Yuan, the president of the Legislative Yuan, and the chairman of the Military Affairs Commission serving as members. A secretariat and a supervision office should be established below to supervise anti-smoking efforts nationwide. 6. Anti-smoking committees should be established in each province, municipality, and county to handle anti-smoking matters in each province, city, and county. 7. Anti-smoking personnel must be astute, capable, diligent, cautious, and honest, and foreign advisors with a spirit of sacrifice and love may be hired to assist in handling matters. 8. From now on, if anyone dares to violate the ban and independently or collusively plant, transport, sell, or consume opium or manufacture, transport, sell, or consume narcotic drugs, regardless of whether they are officials or civilians, they will be severely punished according to law. If any warlord resists the order, they should be denounced and punished, even if it comes to military action. This kind of sanction seems to be a high-pressure tactic, but if the military is unwilling to comply, no matter how perfect the anti-smoking plan is, it will only be a mere formality. As long as one or two are punished, so that other lawless military personnel will have concerns. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Director of Yunnan Education Department Arrives in Nanjing</h3>

In addition to reporting the real situation to the central government, I also request instructions on the future direction of consolidating border defenses. According to my opinion, the border between Myanmar and Yunnan has not yet been clearly demarcated, and the other side is using this as an excuse to invade and occupy. The first step is to resolve the issue of demarcating the national border. How to consolidate national defense and promote friendly relations with neighboring countries is secondary. After meeting with President Wang and the central authorities to report the truth about the Ban Hong incident and request instructions, I will also visit the education authorities to report on the progress of education in Yunnan Province in recent years. There may be some deviations from the central government's education policy, and I would like to ask the education authorities for guidance. The banditry problem in Yunnan Province has been effectively suppressed and fundamentally eliminated, politics are also on track, and finance is barely maintained. The people of the entire province are wholeheartedly supporting the central government and hope that the central government will formulate a direction to consolidate the border, and then everything in Yunnan Province can proceed in an orderly manner."

<h3>Mongolian Committee's Request for Panchen Lama Hospitality Expenses Denied by Central Political Council</h3>

The CPC's finance department rejected the request, stating that the Panchen Lama is a government employee and that the Western Frontier Pacification Envoy Office receives monthly funding from the government. Furthermore, the Panchen Lama receives an annual salary, making it inappropriate to allocate additional hospitality expenses for his visit to Nanjing. However, the Mongolian Committee had previously advanced 4,000 yuan for hospitality expenses and requests the Central Government to approve the reimbursement to avoid losses.

<h3>Negotiations Regarding Japanese Army's Forced Construction of Airfield in Tianjin: Japanese Side Ignores Protests, Local Authorities Sue in Court</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: The issue of the Japanese army forcibly occupying land in Balitai, Nankai, Tianjin to build an airfield continues to be under negotiation. The protest letter sent by the Tianjin Municipal Government to the Japanese Consulate on the 7th of this month is nearly half a month old, but the Japanese side has consistently ignored it, making our side unable to gauge the Japanese attitude and making negotiations difficult. On the 17th of this month, the Municipal Government issued a second protest based on the daily investigation reports from the Provincial Public Security Bureau, detailing all the legal responsibilities of the matter based on the original lease agreement of Guangrentang. The Japanese officer retained the right to demand compensation for damages before the negotiations were resolved. The Provincial Public Security Bureau ordered the Second District Police to dispatch skilled police officers in plain clothes to patrol near Balitai. Several reports on the Japanese construction situation were sent to the bureau daily, which were then forwarded to the provincial and municipal governments. The airfield's earthwork project has been completed on more than 130 mu of land. No fewer than 140 to 150 workers are working daily, supervised by several Japanese police officers who are working in shifts and intensifying their work. The ignorant workers, incited by the Japanese, are extremely hostile to Chinese people passing through the area, so many people have been driven away and injured recently. The central government has not yet sent any instructions to Tianjin regarding this matter. The provincial government's handling of this matter is to follow the instructions of the Beiping Military Branch and maintain a calm attitude. All materials have been compiled and submitted to the central government, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle the negotiations with Japan. The municipal government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate how the original lease agreement of Guangrentang was transferred from Zhang Shaoqing's name to the Japanese Okura Gumi. Local Guangrentang believes that if the dispute escalates, the temple, as the original owner, fears it will not be understood by the Chinese people, so it filed a lawsuit with the Tianjin Local Court yesterday, requesting that the original tenant, Zhang Shaoqing, be summoned to court, recover the property rights, and cancel the original agreement. Although this action cannot make the Japanese, who enjoy extraterritoriality, submit, it proves in the negotiation process that the Japanese side did not obtain the consent of the original owner and started construction on the land without authorization. However, the Japanese side's intention is to ignore any protests and lawsuits and continue the construction regardless. (20th)</p>
<h3>Tragic Situation After Robbery in Northern Sichuan: Over 100,000 Deaths in Guangyuan Alone, Epidemics in Xuanhan Cause Even More Deaths</h3>
<p>Chengdu airmail dispatch: The counties in northern Sichuan that fell into bandit territory have now been gradually recovered, but the people have suffered greatly, with over one million deaths. Even those who survived are mostly homeless and displaced. The small percentage who have returned to their hometowns are without clothing, food, cattle, or seeds, making cultivation impossible. Although Liu Xiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan, and Zhang Lan, the Relief Committee Chairman, have decided on a policy of suppressing the bandits and providing relief at the same time, the disaster-stricken counties number sixteen, with six to seven million surviving people. Given the current financial difficulties of both the public and private sectors in Sichuan, it is questionable where to raise the substantial funds needed to save these refugees. The following is an excerpt from the report of the disaster area investigation conducted by the Relief Committee in Guangyuan and Xuanhan counties to show a glimpse of the situation. If the central government does not take action and the Chinese people do not provide assistance, the plight of hunger and cold will be worse than a fiery bull, and a reckless decision may lead to limitless harm.</p>
<h3>Investigation Report of the Bandit Area in Guangyuan</h3>
<p>The condition of Guangyuan County after being ravaged by bandits, according to the investigation reports of Wan Chucheng and Pang Mingshi, investigators of the Relief Committee, is excerpted as follows: (1) The Red bandits committed extremely heavy massacres. Near Wangcangba, there are approximately 17,000 people who can be identified by the names on the Security Bureau's register who were massacred. In the four rural areas, there are over a hundred pits of massacres, with approximately 7,000 to 8,000 people, which cannot be verified. Over 2,000 people were killed in Pulingzi, over 3,100 people were killed in Mumen, over 30,000 people were killed in Changchi, over 100 people were killed in Luojiaba, over 300 people were killed in Wulangmiao, and over 900 people were killed in the Pinghe-Daheba area. In the Liulisi-Fenshuiling area, over 230 people were killed. After the Dayuhui, over 170 people were killed in the Bachaeng area. Excluding Changchi, which is under the jurisdiction of Nanjiang, in the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th districts of Guangyuan, approximately 32,600 people were massacred by bandits. The corpses seen along the way from Guangyuan to Nanjiang were often numbered in the tens of thousands. People were buried alive in pits, and many female corpses had children on their backs or infants in their arms. Most of them had wooden sticks inserted into their vaginas, which can be described as the most tragic thing on earth. In the Yang family's outhouse in Pulingzi, 77-78 young children, all two or three years old, were thrown in and drowned to death. In the wealthy households, high cabinets and rice warehouses in Changchi and Mumen were often filled with human heads. All of these were done by the communist bandits before they left. As for the traces of killings by bandits when they first arrived and last year, they have not yet been discovered because the refugees have not returned. It is feared that once a detailed investigation is conducted, the number of deaths in this year will be more than the 100,000 reported in the previous telegram. (2) Approximately one-twentieth of the houses in each district were burned down, and more than two-tenths were demolished. The rest have no windows or doors, leaving only four walls. (3) The grain in each district was completely looted before the bandits retreated. The refugees remaining in the bandit areas still have some surplus to maintain the status quo, but those who fled and returned to their hometowns have no grain at all and cannot maintain themselves. People mostly eat tender grass and wild vegetables. There is also an extreme shortage of grain seeds. Many have leveled their fields but have no seeds to plant. The county government is rushing to transport and distribute them. (4) The people coerced by the bandits in each district have been treated leniently by the military and the government, and no past transgressions are being investigated. Recently, 70-80% of those who fled back from the front line of Nanjiang have returned. (5) The 7th, 8th, and 9th districts in the east have been occupied for the longest time, and the bandit influence in various places is also deep. Under the Soviets, there were economic communes, cooperatives, etc., but the bandits arbitrarily massacred people, which lost the people's sympathy. (6) The areas of Wangcangba, Pulingzi, Zhenwugong, Miaoerwan, Mumen, Fenshuiling, Nulangmiao, and Maliuba have been completely lost, destroyed, and ravaged. Fortunately, winter grains in various places are all cultivated. To this day, the bandit's slogans of "Strive for autumn harvest, strive for cultivation" can still be seen, indicating that the bandits also valued grain cultivation. Therefore, there is little wasteland. However, at that time, people were uneasy and cultivation was perfunctory. Later, the military and bandits clashed, and irrigation was neglected. With a timely rain, seedlings and weeds grew together, which also affected the harvest quantity. However, the area planted with opium in the past accounted for about one-tenth of the total area, but this year it is all planted with grain. By shifting and supplementing, it may be the same as normal years. However, with the current shortage of food and the remaining lives after the robbery, there is bound to be a sigh of empty pots and interrupted cooking.</p>
<h3>Investigation Report of the Bandit Area in Xuanhan</h3>
<p>The situation in Xuanhan County investigated by Xuanhan investigators Li Shuyang and Lin Ze is as follows: (1) In each market in Xuanhan, Guanchangdu, Changxi, Huangjinkou, Xixiaengkou, Dongshengchang, and other places, Guanchang was heavily occupied by bandits, and many residents were displaced. The livelihood of the people in Dongshengchang is also very impoverished, but the most tragic is Huangjinkou. The grains and rice buried underground by the people who were lucky enough to survive were very few. Not only that, but the peaks and seedlings of peas and rapeseed were also plucked out. The small spring harvest is generally less than 10%. Although there are few troops and refugees left now, the disaster has been eliminated, but people are dying of hunger every day. The area of Hujiachang, Maoba, Yanshanchang, and Mingguchang, Chixichang, and Maduguan, was heavily occupied by bandits. Many people were killed, and even more fled. Moreover, the main forces of both the bandits and our side fought fiercely for more than two months, with corpses lying all over the fields, and countless seedlings were trampled on. Not only have many displaced children not returned home, but the local authorities have not yet recovered. The remaining water and mountains are unbearable to look at. In the future, relief facilities must be particularly emphasized, otherwise it may not be enough to preserve the survivors. Although the markets below Aikou are worried about the lack of food, they have been recovered for a long time, and there are no unexpected losses. It is easier to rescue them. (2) The grain seeds in Xuanhan are mostly problematic. Each official handling emergency relief is conducting on-site investigations. The towns that are unable to purchase and transport rice seeds will be given subsidies from the emergency relief funds they carry, depending on the situation, to handle it themselves. If it is not enough, they can report back to the county for additional allocation. Although there is bound to be a concern that the porridge is too little and the monks are too many, in this difficult financial situation, we can only save the most urgent cases first. (3) Currently, epidemics are prevalent in each market in Xuanhan, especially in the northwest regions. After inquiring, each market has hundreds of patients, and 80-90% of them do not respond to treatment. Most of them die within eight or nine days. Examination results show that typhus accounts for 80-90%, and influenza accounts for 20-30%. Treatment is very difficult, especially for typhus. In the aftermath of this great catastrophe, money and medicine are both scarce, which is a deep concern. Moreover, typhus has infectious characteristics: the stronger a person is, the easier and more severely they get sick, and the faster they die. Thinking that labor and service depend on adults, and adults have suffered great losses due to the bandit disaster, most of the farming is left to healthy women, and if they suffer from this epidemic, what will happen to the future? Furthermore, since the spring sacrifice to summer, the scorching sun is increasing day by day, and the spread of the infection will have a prairie fire effect. It is impossible to treat and impossible not to save, which is a concern. It is hoped that medical and charitable organizations inside and outside the province will be called upon to send enthusiastic and intelligent doctors, carrying large quantities of typhus vaccine and medicine, to inject people everywhere, to protect the uninfected from infection, and to prevent the infected from dying, which is also a great contribution to preserving survivors. It is found that the infection is in the food and spring water. The officials have advised people to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and to put the roots of Ge, Pu, Cang, and Atractylodes Lancea in the drinking water to kill germs. However, in this time of difficulty in making a living, how many can do it? How many can believe it? It is not yet known. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<h3>Songjiang First District Repairs Roads and Bridges</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the motor road, land and water transportation in Songjiang City has become convenient, and visitors from other places come to Songjiang in droves. Li Zufu, the district chief of the first district, believes that the West Gate Street, where shops and businesses are concentrated, has heavy traffic and the paved stones on the street have been broken and sunken, or the ditches are blocked, and rainwater accumulates and stains clothing, which hinders pedestrians. Therefore, it has been decided to hire workers day and night to repair the section from Diaqiao to Taqiao. Work will be done at night from Diaqiao to Changqiao, and work will be done during the day from Changqiao West to Taqiao to maintain traffic. Furthermore, the Huayang Bridge in the eastern suburbs has not yet been leveled, which is inconvenient for passengers getting on and off at the bus station. It is also planned to rebuild it. A letter has been sent to Xu Chunbo, the mayor of the town, inviting local people to discuss raising funds and plans, and reporting them for approval. Once the bridge is leveled, all the bridges in Songjiang City will be passable by cars.</p>

<h3>Kunshan Lake Bandit Bai Shu Robbery</h3>
<p>Yangcheng Lake in Kunshan County has always been a place where bandits roam. Yesterday at 3 PM, boatman Zhou Zhilin and Zhu Rongxiang loaded 1,300 packages of salt from Liuhe to Wujin. To their surprise, they encountered two bandit boats in Yangcheng Lake near Bacheng Town. There were more than a dozen bandits on board, holding guns, who boarded the boat to rob. Zhou and others dared not resist. The bandits immediately loaded the salt onto the bandit boats, fired a gun to show their power, and set sail. Afterwards, Zhou reported the incident to the Bacheng Public Security Bureau, which sent police to pursue, but the bandits were long gone.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Police Officer Disciplined for Misconduct</h3>
<p>Mao Yijun, the chief of the Third Public Security Sub-bureau, has been diligent in cracking down on gambling and opium dens since taking office a year ago. On the evening of the 11th of last month, Chief Mao dispatched bureau officer Sun Zhongjie, leading police to the home of Zhu Hongda under the Pagoda Pool outside the South Gate, where they arrested sixteen gamblers including Zhu Wangshi. Fines were issued, with receipts provided by the bureau. Recently, however, Hou Zhuoying, a teacher at a primary school outside the South Gate, collected eleven of these fine receipts and had them photographed at a photography studio, alleging that these fines had not been reported. Bureau officer Sun Zhongjie learned of this and privately went to the photography studio, daringly taking five photographic prints of the fine receipts taken by Hou and giving them to a lawyer, personally notifying the lawyer by telephone and urging them to proceed, or so it is said. Chief Mao of the sub-bureau learned of this and, suspecting Sun's motives, immediately reported the matter to the bureau chief at the main bureau. Bureau Chief Chen immediately dispatched Chief Inspector Wang, leading a squad of patrol officers, who rushed to the Third Sub-bureau at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, bringing bureau officer Sun Zhongjie, employee Pu Jihong, police chief Liu Desheng, office police officer Xu Yi, Shao Liren, Wang Fusheng and others to the main bureau. They also searched Sun Zhongjie's bedroom and home. Subsequently, gambler Zhu Wangshi and Tu Zheng Pan Hongqi were summoned to the bureau, where Bureau Chief Chen personally interrogated them. Afterwards, Sun Zhongjie and Xu Yi were ordered to be suspended and placed under surveillance, while Pu Jihong, Shao Liren, and Wang Fusheng were released on bail. The others were dismissed. Yesterday (the 22nd) at 8:00 AM, Bureau Chief Chen prepared a document and dispatched police to transfer Sun Zhongjie, Xu Yi, Pu Jihong, Shao Liren, Wang Fusheng, and Liu Desheng, a total of six individuals, to the local branch court for handling. It is rumored that Sub-bureau Chief Mao Yijun has also tendered his resignation.</p>

<h3>Brazil Limits Japanese Immigration; Nine-Tenths Rejected; The Gate to the Brazilian Paradise Closes</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received today from the Overseas Development Corporation in Brazil, the Brazilian Constitutional Assembly passed the immigration restriction bill on the afternoon of the 24th by a large majority of 41 to 146 votes. According to the bill, the annual number of immigrants from each country must not exceed 20% of the total number of immigrants in the past 50 years. Given this situation, Japanese immigration will be limited to about one-tenth. The gateway to the Brazilian paradise has now been effectively sealed off. (United Press telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs issued a statement today, saying that the government has not yet received an official telegram, but all immigration companies have this news, which is likely to be true. If so, of the 150,000 Japanese immigrants to date, only 3,000 can be moved out each year, far from the 23,000 moved out last year. It is very regrettable for the sake of Japanese-Brazilian friendship. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs will discuss appropriate countermeasures with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (China United Press, 25th)</p>
<h3>Shooting at the Japanese Consulate Resolved with a Russian Apology</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Consulate General in Khabarovsk was shot at. Ota, the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he met with Stomonyakov, the Acting People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, on the 22nd, and submitted a document regarding the shooting of the Japanese Consulate in Khabarovsk on April 20th and 21st. The document explained the situation, stating that while fortunately no deaths or injuries occurred, stray bullets flew near the Consul General's bedroom, which must be considered an unexpected incident. Fortunately, the room was unoccupied at the time, avoiding a tragedy. Recently, not only in Khabarovsk, but also in Ulan-Ude, the Soviet authorities have treated Japanese officials with extreme coldness. At a time when Japanese-Soviet friendship is being promoted, it is regrettable that the Soviet Union has taken such an attitude. If local officials continue to maintain such a hostile attitude towards Japanese people, it is inevitable that unpleasant incidents will occur between Japan and the Soviet Union in the future. It is hoped that serious and effective measures will be taken to protect the lives and property of the Japanese Consulate and its officials. Stomonyakov's response to the case was also received on the morning of the 22nd, with a telegram from Merinikov, a dispatcher from the Far East Foreign Ministry, stating that the incident was actually a dispute between several drunks and the police. The police fired to suppress the situation, and inadvertently, stray bullets hit the Japanese Consulate. It was fortunate that there were no casualties. The authorities intend to detain the police officer who fired arbitrarily for fifteen days, and the drunks have been apprehended and are being interrogated. The Soviet side will work hard to prevent such incidents from happening again, and it has now been reported. Stomonyakov has expressed his apologies for the case and hopes that it will not be escalated, and will strive to ensure full security in the future. Ambassador Ota, based on the report from Consul General Shimada, criticized the Soviet local authorities for their irresponsible attitude towards the case, and said that Soviet officials in the Far East generally have a rude tendency, which is regrettable. There was an incident of shooting down a Japanese plane, and recently there was an incident of shooting at a "Manchukuo" ship. This incident is another example. If this kind of extraordinary measure continues, it may cause unfortunate incidents. It is hoped that the above situation will not occur in the future, and repeatedly draw their attention to this matter. Therefore, the case seems to have come to an end for now.

<h3>London City Council: Swastika Flag Raised; Fascist Party Deliberately Makes Trouble</h3>
<p>(London) When London City Council employees arrived at the council today, they saw a black swastika flag above the British flag on the flagpole. They quickly ordered it to be removed. It was found that three members of the Imperial Fascist League (note: this organization is not the British Fascist League led by Sir Mosley) climbed over the twelve-foot-high wall and reached the flagpole, raising the swastika flag. Today happened to be Empire Day, and Councilor Morrison criticized the act, saying that troublemakers from the Fascist Party were deliberately causing trouble and promoting German propaganda. This frivolous act must stop, otherwise it will only bring shame. If the German Chancellor is wise, he should tell his fanatical followers in England not to violate British public property.

<h3>Gold and Silver</h3>
<p>London Gold Price: Today (25th), the London gold price is 136 shillings and 6.5 pence, down 0.5 pence from yesterday.</p>
<p>London Bar Silver: In the London silver market today (25th), the spot price is 19.5625 pence and the futures price is 19.625 pence, both the same as yesterday's price. There was a slight purchase by the United States in the morning, and the market situation was stable.</p>
<p>New York Bar Silver: The silver market in New York today (25th) is volatile, but the market is stable. Market participants are now waiting for the results of today's review of the Silver Legislation Act. The market situation was quiet and stable after the opening. The selling of the May contract was absorbed by the industry. Most speculators are watching from the sidelines. The opening price for forward contracts was 10 points higher or 6 points lower than yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Bombay Bar Silver: The Bombay silver market today (25th) is stable. At the close, both near-term and far-term fell 2 annas. The spot price is 53 rupees and 12 annas.</p>
<p>London Special Dispatch, 25th: The price of the pound sterling, converted to gold coins of other countries, has recently declined slightly. The reason is not due to the weakness of the pound itself, but due to the recovery of the financial situation of the countries using gold. Because the financial climate of the countries using gold is better, they are gradually withdrawing their cash stored in England and France to Switzerland. Calculated in US dollars, the pound's price is also weak. Rumors have arisen that American funds in England have flowed back to the United States because the expansion plan has shown satisfactory results. However, according to knowledgeable people, the British are slightly buying US dollars in a market with very little fluctuation, hoping to profit from the low prices in the New York market. This is the main reason for the weakness of the pound against the dollar. It is said that those who control exchange rates in the UK are now selling francs and not paying attention to the dollar.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market today (25th) had a lot of transactions. Many US dollars were sold. The opening price for British-American exchange was 5 yuan and 09.25 points, 0.25 points lower than yesterday's US-British exchange closing price. The market situation was calm in the morning, with slight differences. At 3:00 PM, it rose 0.0625 points to 5 yuan and 09.3125 points. Also, one US dollar equals 3 shillings and 11.125 pence.</p>
<p>British-French: The opening price today (25th) was 77 francs and 03 points, the same as yesterday's closing price. The market situation was quiet in the morning, and the price remained unchanged at 77 francs and 03 points until 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>American-British: The New York exchange rate for British pounds today (25th) opened at 5 yuan and 09.5 points, 1.25 points higher than yesterday's closing price. There were no changes in the second round. The third round was 5 yuan and 09.375 points. The fourth round was 5 yuan and 09 points, down 0.25 points from the opening price. The final price was 5 yuan and 09.125 points.</p>
<p>American-French: The New York exchange rate for French francs today (25th) opened at 6.61 and a quarter, up a quarter from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>American Cotton: The cotton market today (25th) opened with a rebound. Retail investors liquidated, and both southern and local investors sold, but they were absorbed by the industry and Japanese merchants. Later, the market price loosened due to continued liquidation by bulls and slight selling by Europe. The market situation was quiet when the price fell.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton: The Bombay cotton market today (25th) fell at first due to liquidation by bulls, but rose due to purchases by Japanese merchants and short covering. At 5:30 PM, the price of the July-August contract for White Roc cotton fell 12 annas to 195 rupees and 75.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market today (25th) was closed and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market today (25th) had a price of 4 shillings and 6.375 pence for the July contract at 1:00 PM, up 0.375 from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<h3>Rubber</h3>
<p>London: The market situation today (25th) was quiet. The July and September contracts were traded at noon.</p>
<p>The price was 6 pence, up 0.0625 from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York: The market opened today (25th) and was stable due to telegrams from London, but sentiment was mixed. The industry sold slightly, and short covering was mostly concentrated in the December contract. The market situation continued to be quiet and unexcited after the opening. Speculators are now watching developments in Washington. The price is about 30-40 pounds lower than London.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York: The market opened weak today (25th) and lacked excitement. Yesterday's slight price increase led to more selling. However, judging from the market situation, the bulls seem to have liquidated early. The trend is expected to remain sluggish and uncertain. The market situation was indeed stagnant and dull. Most stock prices fell, but only by small amounts. The number of transactions in the first hour this morning was 90,000 shares. The following is the report of fifteen stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange (10:45 AM) by He Sheng Yanghang:</p>

<p>London Special Dispatch, 25th, London: Gold mine stocks are firm due to good investment demand and the upcoming dividend announcement next month. The securities market still expects the gold price to be 140 shillings per ounce, but those in the foreign exchange market are not so optimistic, believing that the price of the franc against the pound will rise to 75. Recently, those who manage exchange rates in the UK have sold francs, intending to prevent the franc from rising too much. This shows that the British authorities are well aware of the dangers involved, but what will happen next depends on President Roosevelt's silver policy. If this policy is fully implemented, there will inevitably be a large sale of American gold.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Bribery Case in Japan (Japanese Dispatch) - Stock Dumping Sparks a Storm - Incumbent Vice Finance Minister Arrested - Political Parties Seize Opportunity to Grab Power - Warlords Use Excuse to Expand Military Influence</h3>
<p>The corruption of Japanese politics has been particularly exposed recently. Fraud and embezzlement cases have emerged one after another. However, the exposure of cases and the investigations by the courts have always targeted retired officials. Incumbent officials can barely maintain their face. Even the disciplinary issues repeatedly raised in the 65th Diet this year, involving two cabinet members, lacked conclusive evidence. This time, it is different. The incumbent Vice Minister of Finance, Hideo Kuroda, was suddenly summoned by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office on May 19. After interrogation, he was immediately prosecuted on charges of malfeasance and detained in Ichigaya Prison.</p>
<p>This major scandal is different from previous scandals. The involvement of important government figures is also different. This bribery case is a cleverly crafted fraud to obtain money by important figures in the financial and business circles. Originally, during the World War, Japanese industries made rapid progress. Suzuki Shoten in Kobe was one of the nouveau riche. By the time the war ended and European countries were recovering, Japan had gained many advantages. However, in 1927, a financial panic occurred in Japan. Suzuki Shoten could no longer support its empty shell and fell into a tragic fate. Suzuki Shoten borrowed a particularly large amount of money from the Bank of Taiwan. When Suzuki Shoten collapsed, the Bank of Taiwan was about to collapse with it. However, the Japanese government, for the sake of managing its colonies, had to rescue the Bank of Taiwan. As a result, the Bank of Japan lent the Bank of Taiwan more than 600 million Japanese yen. Then, all kinds of stocks controlled by Suzuki Shoten became collateral pledged by the Bank of Taiwan to the Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>The stocks of Teikoku Jinzo Kenshi Co., Ltd. were originally held by the Bank of Taiwan. Since then, they have also become part of the Bank of Japan's holdings. The number is 220,513 shares. At the time of the pledge, partly because the Japanese market was bad and partly because Suzuki Shoten had just collapsed and the credit of the Bank of Taiwan was poor, the market price of the stock fell to just over 40 yen. However, the artificial silk market gradually improved, especially for Japanese products. The Japanese artificial silk industry jumped to fifth place in the world. Therefore, the previous decision to shorten work by 30% was completely abandoned the year before last. Then, Teikoku Jinzo Kenshi Co., Ltd. was no exception. Its stock also soared from just over 40 yen to about 150 yen on the market. People in the financial world, especially those related to the Bank of Taiwan, paid close attention to the more than 220,000 shares of stock in the Bank of Japan's vault. In January last year, the market price of these stocks fell to around 122 yen. Shigeru Shimada, the general manager of the Bank of Taiwan, discussed with Ryosei Kawai and Mamoru Nagano, directors of Teikoku Jinzo Kenshi Co., Ltd., how to get these stocks out of the Bank of Japan and how to sell them for profit. Shimada lobbied various related parties. At the same time, to get the stocks out, the permission of the Ministry of Finance was required. Therefore, Vice Minister Kuroda and Teiji Okubo, the director of the Banking Bureau, were lobbied by them. It is said that the reward money was at least several hundred thousand. As a result, 100,000 shares of the company's stock were sold. The selling price at that time was 125 yen, but a commission of 1 yen and other handling fees of 3.75 yen had to be deducted. Later, at the suggestion of the company's two directors, the capital was increased, combining three old shares into two new shares, and increasing the dividend distribution. The company's stock rose from a market price of 122 yen to 150 yen. The profit from the stock price increase was 7 million, and the profit from the capital increase was 5.2 million, totaling more than 12 million. This is the profit shared by Shimada, Kawai, Takagi, and their ilk, and it is also the loss of the Bank of Taiwan.</p>
<p>This matter was raised in the Diet. At that time, Vice Minister Kuroda's answer was that "the Bank of Taiwan made a loss-making transaction," barely covering up his ugliness. However, the facts were finally exposed. When the parties involved in the Bank of Taiwan were investigated, Kuroda's inside story was also revealed. This case not only highlights the many uglinesses inside Japanese financial capital, but also reveals the laxity of discipline in the political world. Because this is a major case unprecedented in Japanese history, involving the Ministry of Finance, it will inevitably involve the current cabinet. At the very least, Finance Minister Takahashi cannot shirk his responsibility. This is precisely the opportunity for political parties to seize power, taking this opportunity to settle accounts with the non-partisan cabinet. The military is the one whose momentum is the greatest, whose words are the loudest, and whose actions are the most violent. Although it may not seize power because of this, it can despise everything and pursue its military policy independently. (May 20)</p>

<h3>Japan Interferes with Security Forces in War Zone - Shibayama Presents Four Conditions - Yu Xuezhong Discusses Negotiation Situation</h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The newly compiled war zone security force of the Hebei Provincial Government, about 9,000 strong, has completed its training and is preparing to go to the Luan-Yu-Ji-Mi area for rotation. Previously, Tao Shangming, the commissioner of the Luan-Yu area, and Yin Rugeng, the commissioner of the Ji-Mi area, had contacted Oohashi, the staff officer of the Japanese garrison in North China, and Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy. Currently, the Japanese side has raised objections to the number of people and weapons. Shibayama presented a memorandum to our side, the content of which is roughly divided into four items: (1) Precautions for the new security force entering the war zone: (a) The number of people shall not exceed the current number of residents (approximately 6,000); (b) Light machine guns shall not be carried; (c) Be careful in selecting the commander of the general team, and it is hoped that the Japanese side will be notified in advance; (2) All light machine guns carried by the current security force in the war zone shall be withdrawn in the shortest possible time; (3) Prevent anti-Japanese activities in the war zone; (4) The police housing fee of 7,000 yuan in the "Manchukuo" border area of Gubeikou shall be allocated as soon as possible. Our side made verbal replies to each item. Regarding the first item, (a) the quota of the newly compiled security force is 9,000, which is based on the oral agreement of the Tanggu Agreement. The actual number is only more than 8,000, divided into two general teams, stationed in the Luan-Yu-Ji-Mi area; (b) light machine guns are not included in the list of heavy weapons. The new security force is scheduled to have 50 light machine guns per district team, a total of 200 for both general teams; (c) the commanders of the general team have been appointed as Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian. Of course, they can contact the Japanese side. Regarding the second item, the weapons of the Hean team currently stationed in the war zone do not need to be withdrawn because they will soon be rotated. Regarding the third item, attention has been paid. Regarding the fourth item, the repair fee of 7,000 yuan for the puppet police houses in Gubeikou can be allocated immediately. After the Japanese side replied, except for the issue of weapons, which is still planned to be discussed, there are no more issues. After further negotiations, the new security force can be rotated into the war zone at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong, chairman of Hebei Province, told reporters in Peiping: (1) Regarding the rotation of the new and old security forces in the war zone, the Japanese side initially raised many objections to the number of people and weapons. After Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming, the two commissioners, consulted with Oohashi, the staff officer of the Japanese side, and Shibayama, the military attaché, our side said that although the number of people in the newly compiled security force was not explicitly stipulated in the Tanggu Agreement, the total number was orally agreed to be 9,000. The actual number of security forces currently compiled is only more than 8,000, which is not inconsistent with the original agreement. (2) When receiving the war zone, the so-called agreement that our security force should not carry heavy weapons referred to mortars and other artillery. After Zhou Yuying's troops cleared the bandits in Luan Dong Fu Ning, all light and heavy machine guns were handed over to the provincial government. The Japanese side cited this as a precedent and also intended to restrict machine guns. However, light machine guns should definitely not be included in the scope of restrictions. Therefore, the new security force decided to carry light machine guns to meet the needs of bandit suppression. Except for the weapon issue, which still needs to be discussed further with the Japanese side, there are generally no issues. If everything is quickly negotiated, it is expected that they can enter the war zone in early June to take over the defense. At the same time, the old security force will withdraw. (3) 500,000 yuan has been raised to repair the Yellow River embankment in Hebei Province, and it is also planned to borrow a part from the Hebei Provincial Bank to step up construction to prevent the flood season. (4) The provincial government meeting decided to convene a county magistrate meeting. Because the duties of the county magistrates are important, it is inconvenient for all of them to come to Tianjin. It was decided to convene them in three batches. (24th)</p>
<h3>Bandit Nest in Hengfeng, Northeast Jiangxi, Recovered - Fang Zhimin's Main Base Lost - Remnants Fleeing to the Geyuan Area</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Hengfeng is a remote small county in northeastern Jiangxi, with high terrain and many mountains. To the east, it can connect to the Zhejiang border via Shangrao Yushan, to the north, it can connect to northern Fujian via Qianshan, to the west, it is connected to Yiyang, and the Xin River and Rao River, and to the north, it connects to Dexing Leping and Wuyuan Qimen in Anhui. Since 1929, it has been occupied by the Fang bandits as a nest, serving as the center of the redification of the Xin River and Rao River basins, and as a military base for raiding the borders of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Its puppet Jiangxi Northeast Committee, puppet Jiangxi Zhejiang Anhui Military Region Headquarters, and puppet Provincial Soviet Government were all located there. It has been working hard to develop the Geyuan area northeast of Hengfeng, where puppet arsenals, Red Army schools, and all reactionary organs are located. Although it has been recovered several times by divisions led by Lu Xiaochen and Zhou Hunyuan, the banditization was too deep, the economic foundation was completely subverted, and it was impossible to properly handle the aftermath, resulting in repeated losses. This time, Chairman Chiang ordered Chen Diaoyuan and Zhao Guantao to command the armies of the three provinces of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui to advance in multiple directions to suppress the bandits. Yu Jishi's troops, advancing from Yushan via Shangrao, first captured Zhangcun Linjianghu. Chen Diaoyuan's troops, advancing south from Wuyuan Dexing, arrived at Hengbian at the same time, taking on the task of eliminating the Tan Brigade in the Guixi, Yujiang, Yiyang, Wannian, and Bianlian areas. On the 11th, they captured Heqiao, which belonged to Wan. Liang Lizhu's troops, responsible for taking Hengfeng City, were divided into two routes. One route detoured west of Shangrao, flanking Hengdong to cut off the Fang bandits' eastward escape route. The other route crossed the river north from Hekou, passing through Dawangdu. This route was only dozens of miles away from Hengfeng County, and was the shortcut to enter Hengfeng City. Therefore, the Fang bandits desperately built fortifications near Hengfeng, north of Huangteng Bridge, intending to defend to the death. Zhao's brigade had fought many bloody battles with the Fang bandits' puppet 10th Army. On the 13th, Zhao's brigade advanced to the Wenbi Peak area, four or five miles away from Hengxian City. The bandits immediately built several stone bunkers on Sunjia Mountain and the isolated Zhutou Mountain, resisting stubbornly. Zhao's brigade used mountain artillery and machine guns to cover the attack, and successively occupied various key passes. The Zhutou Mountain stone bunker was also captured by Wang's regiment on the 18th, killing and capturing no less than several hundred bandits. The Fang bandits lost all the strategic locations and solid fortifications around Hengfeng, and were extremely panicked. They held an emergency meeting in Heng City. According to captured bandits, all bandit women were encouraged to have their husbands and concubines serve as Red Army soldiers. However, the strong men in the bandit area were exhausted. The National Army was surrounding Heng City from all sides. The Fang bandits could not but abandon Heng City and flee to the Lizhi Geyuan area. Liang's division and Zhao's brigade took advantage of the victory and advanced rapidly, occupying Hengfeng City at this moment on the morning of the 23rd. In addition to deploying defensive fortifications around the city and completing rear communication defense preparations, they were also pursuing the bandits. The headquarters received a telegram from Liang Lizhu of Shangrao on the evening of the 23rd reporting the victory and immediately replied with commendation. (24th)</p>
<h3>Hunan and Guangdong Military Police Cooperate in Suppressing Communist Bandits in Rucheng - Li Mingrui's Troops Surrounded by Government Forces - More Than 1,000 Disarmed Remnants Fled</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Li Mingrui's troops led by Li Zongbao, a branch of the Communist bandits in northern Guangdong and southern Hunan, suddenly raided Lotte County a few days ago, plundering guns from the Pingshi militia. Later, troops from Hunan and Guangdong were dispatched to cooperate in suppression, and the Li bandits were repelled and the Zheng Guang bandit nest was destroyed. The Guangdong defense forces have now deployed defenses along the Pingshi border. Unexpectedly, the remnants of Li Mingrui's troops recently gathered the remnants and fled west to the vicinity of Rucheng on the Hunan border and other places such as Huangling. The number of bandits is about 2,000, and they occupy the high mountains along Rucheng and Chenkou, openly building defensive fortifications. On the 15th of this month, Hu, the director of the Hunan Household Regiment, together with a regiment of Ma Brigade troops, and accompanied by the Guangdong border military police, ordered a general attack on the bandit positions. The Hunan military regiment divided into multiple routes to attack the bandit positions in Rucheng Chenkou. Li Mingrui's troops also relied on the dangerous terrain to resist stubbornly. The Hunan and Guangdong military police bravely surrounded them, occupying many bandit positions. Li's bandits were besieged from all sides and were in a desperate situation. The government forces used giant cannons and machine guns to sweep the bandits, causing heavy casualties. Several times they charged out, but all failed. They soon raised a white flag to surrender. The government forces, fearing their deception, continued to intercept them. The bandits abandoned their weapons and fled. Until late at night, Li's bandits, taking advantage of the government forces' slightly weaker firepower, led a remnant force and desperately rushed down the mountain, fleeing towards the northeast of Rucheng. The Hunan Provincial Militia intercepted them along the way, and bandit corpses littered the roads. In this battle, almost all of Li Mingrui's bandits were wiped out. More than 1,000 bandit guns were seized. The whereabouts of the bandit leader Li Mingrui are unknown. (19th)</p>
<h3>Wu Yaoqi, Deputy Commissioner of Tianjin Customs, Attacked - Thugs Committing Crime in Shi Yousan's Car - Commissioner of Customs Asks French Consulate to Guarantee Safety</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Wu Yaoqi, the deputy commissioner of Tianjin Customs, was suddenly attacked by bandits on the afternoon of the 21st of this month. A bullet pierced his right shoulder. Fortunately, it did not injure any vital organs. He has been sent to the French West Kai Hospital for treatment. Wu is a native of Hangxian County, Zhejiang Province, 48 years old. He came to Tianjin Customs in 1930 and also served as the director of the Dagong Affairs Office. He is usually very conscientious in his duties. At 5:50 p.m. on the 21st, after Wu got off work, he took a rickshaw to the Customs Colleagues Club in Yianli, No. 31, French Concession. As the car entered the east end of No. 31 Road, a light green sedan car, number 1525, drove up from behind. As the two cars met in front of Yianli, Wu was about to get out of the car. At this time, the car following behind suddenly honked its horn several times, seemingly to make Wu's car give way. Wu's rickshaw puller immediately pulled to the side of the road. Unexpectedly, at this time, several thugs in the car opened the car window and fired four shots at Wu. One bullet hit Wu's right shoulder blade. Wu did not feel any pain at the time. After the car carrying the thugs sped west along No. 31 Road and disappeared into the Japanese Concession, the rickshaw puller discovered that Wu had been injured, and blood was flowing from behind his shoulder. He hurriedly informed Wu himself. Wu then felt the pain and immediately fell to the ground. The rickshaw puller hurriedly reported to the colleagues at the Customs Club. After hearing the news, they immediately reported to the French Engineering Bureau to arrest the murderer, and carried Wu into the French West Kai Hospital. After washing and applying medicine, Wu's mind was clear. He told people in detail about the attack, but did not know why he had offended anyone, causing him to be harmed. On the 22nd, the foreign commissioner of Tianjin Customs specially visited the French consul in Tianjin, requesting that the murderer be arrested as soon as possible to protect the safety of the customs colleagues. In addition, the situation was telegraphed to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance. Although the occurrence of this matter is not surprising, it is because the 6th Precinct intercepted a car, the car number is 1525, which was the car taken by the bandits when they committed the crime. However, the original owner of the car is Shi Yousan, who is living in seclusion in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin. Shi did not come forward to identify the car. Instead, two Japanese people asked the Public Security Bureau to release it. This is quite surprising. The car was discovered on the 22nd. At about 11 a.m. that morning, the Xin Qiaoshunyi, who was on duty at the intersection of Guanshanli, Yongan Street, Tianjin South City, suddenly saw a car driving up to the Guanshanli intersection. The car body was light green, and the number was 1525, which was the car used by the bandits who were wanted for attacking Wu Yaoqi. Therefore, he and the driver, Wang Yuting, were arrested and transferred to the Provincial Public Security Bureau. According to Wang Yuting, 45 years old, he is Shi Yousan's driver. The 1525 car belongs to Shi Yousan. Today, he was ordered by his master to pick up Zhang Jingbo, a diviner, in Guanshanli, Yongan Street, South City, to tell the master's fortune. He didn't know anything else. The Public Security Bureau was about to send personnel to investigate when two Japanese people came to the bureau and wanted to meet with Director Li Junxiang. After Li met with them, the two Japanese people claimed to be merchants from the Ota Trading Company in the Japanese Concession. The 1525 car belonged to the company and was not driven out on the 21st. They requested that it be returned. Li said that the driver confessed that the car belonged to Shi Yousan, and the two Japanese people pointed to it as their own. It is not difficult to prove that Shi Yousan instigated the Japanese to come and identify the car, hoping to escape punishment. However, before the evidence is conclusive, he is unwilling to make people suspected, so he released the car driver that night, and the car will be returned after the investigation is clear. However, the owner of the intercepted 1525 car is Shi Yousan. Wu Yaoqi, who was injured, did not know why Shi wanted to kill Wu. (22nd)</p>

<h3>Rent Reduction Movement in Suzhou City Shops</h3>
<p>In recent years, Suzhou's commercial sector has been unusually sluggish. In the most bustling areas of the city, such as Guanqian Street, Chayuan Square, and Hulong Street (East, West, and Central Markets), shops closing down due to financial difficulties are common. Currently, shops in the Chayuan Square area and others have launched a rent reduction movement initiated by Wei Guopin and others. On the afternoon of the 24th, they invited representatives from various shops to hold a meeting at the Guandi Temple, where they unanimously agreed to support the movement. Their initial plan is to submit a petition to the county chamber of commerce, the county government, and the county party headquarters, requesting them to find ways to reduce rents in order to maintain their businesses.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Unregistered Cocoon Businesses Not Allowed to Open</h3>
<p>The spring cocoon market of this year is about to open in an instant. The cocoon businesses in this county, feeling that the provincial regulations for cocoon business control were harsh, held an emergency meeting the afternoon before yesterday, opposing them unanimously and sending telegrams to officials in the capital and province to appeal. The situation was recorded in yesterday's newspaper telegrams. It is now learned that Cai Jingde, the deputy director of the county's silkworm farming model area, in order to strictly enforce the cocoon business control, fearing that cocoon merchants would undermine the control measures by opening for business privately without registering, specially sent letters to both the banking and finance industries yesterday, stating that all cocoon businesses that have not registered and paid a deposit in accordance with the cocoon business control measures shall not be allowed to open. If they enter into contracts to borrow money from the banking and finance industries, they should be rejected. Otherwise, once the area investigates and confirms, it will detain and punish them. The banking and finance industries have not yet expressed their opinions after receiving the letters.</p>
<h3>Silk Improvement Association Sends Commissioners to Wuxi for Investigation</h3>
<p>This county is a region where silk production is developed. Recently, the National Economic Committee's Silk Improvement Association, in order to investigate the general situation of silkworm breeding in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in order to determine selection standards, specially sent officials to inspect separately. The commissioner sent to inspect Jiangsu Province is Ni Shaowen, a technical specialist of the association. After receiving his orders, Ni has already arrived in Wuxi a few days ago, going to various silkworm breeding factories for investigation in recent days. His investigation and classification include: 1. Factory name, 2. Source of original breed, 3. Development status of silkworms, 4. Whether crossbreeding is thorough, 5. Whether the factory's equipment, such as silkworm rooms, silkworm tools, and cold storage, are complete, and paying particular attention to the general situation of medium and low-grade breeds. Ni has now investigated more than ten places, and expects to stay for another two or three days. Once the investigation is completed, he will transfer to Jintan for investigation.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Shao Yuanchong Visits Changshu to Browse Qu's Collection of Books</h3>
<p>Shao Yuanchong, the current member of the Central Committee and Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Zhang Mojun, arrived in Changshu on the 24th by steamboat from the 2nd District of the Suzhou Water Police. In addition to his attendants from the capital, those who came with him also included former Prime Minister Li Genyuan and clerk Deng from the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Wei Zhanyuan, the district chief of the 2nd District Water Police, sent patrol officer Yang Shand to protect the ship. The steamboat arrived in port at noon, keeping their movements very secret and attracting little attention. They then opened four rooms in the Changshu Hotel, including room 23, to live in. In the afternoon, they climbed Yushan in the city, paid respects to the tomb of Yan Ziyou, and visited Xin Feng Pavilion and the Zhaoming Reading Hall, returning late. Unexpectedly, at about 10 o'clock at night, a number of small hooligans, unaware that they were Shao and others, unexpectedly caused trouble in the hotel for no reason. Shao was angry and immediately ordered them to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Only then did outsiders learn of Shao and others' arrival in Changshu, and they went to visit, but were all refused. Today (the 25th), they took a sedan to visit the Xingfu Temple on Beishan and other scenic spots such as Sanfeng. According to his attendants, Shao and others' trip was specially for the purpose of visiting the famous Tieqin Bronze Sword Building of Qu, a famous book collector in Changshu. Therefore, in the afternoon, he ordered the Education Bureau to be notified to open the library for him to browse, and plans to make an appointment with Qu to visit his library. It is expected that they will leave Changshu on the afternoon of the 26th.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: President of the High Court Arrives in Cheng</h3>
<p>Lin Biao, the president of the High Court, went to Xichang counties last year to inspect them once in order to investigate the judiciary of each county. Yesterday (the 24th) morning, he came to Cheng from Suzhou again, lodging in the Huayuan Hotel. In the afternoon, he went to the county government to investigate the files of judicial cases, and prisoners who had been detained without trial in the prison. He also went to the site of the new prison to survey it. On the morning of the 25th, he went to Jingjiang for inspection.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cooperative Established</h3>
<p>He Qian, a cooperative instructor from this county, recently went to Changyinsha with Wu Weiwen, an investigator from the Farmers Bank, to guide the organization of cotton cooperatives. Five locations have been established, including Feianwei, Xiangyangwei, Ougengwei, Longtaiwei, and Xinqiao. Most of the members are farmers who grow cotton fields. After the Farmers Bank releases the loans, a joint cooperative will be established at Laohaiba. In the future, it will also be necessary to merge with the cooperatives in Nantong and Changshu to establish a general office in Shierweigang. Various joint transportation and sales methods are being drafted and will be announced and implemented soon. In addition, the Provincial Farmers Bank plans to establish a cotton production and marketing office in Changyinsha. The measures have been basically decided, and cooperative instructor Feng Zanyuan has been sent to Cheng to inspect.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Young Couple Commit Suicide in Hotel</h3>
<p>Huang Naiwen, also known as Shaozhen, a 25-year-old from Fujian, once served as a general affairs officer at a provincial high school in his hometown. Later, he went to Shanghai and fell in love at first sight with Xia Jinlian, a woman who opened a clothing store in Shanghai. Their parents found out about their love, and because lovers found it difficult to become husband and wife, they went to Hangzhou together from Shanghai on the 19th of this month, staying at the West Lake Hotel, Room 94. In recent days, they pawned almost everything, and their finances were in dire straits. They conceived the idea of committing suicide and bought two bottles of Lysol and swallowed them. The bellboy noticed their strange complexions when he entered the room and knew that they had taken poison. He immediately reported it to the police station, and they were taken to the hospital by car for treatment.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing: Collection of Defense Donations Leads to Market Strike</h3>
<p>A few days ago, the Pingchuan Public Security Branch in Shaoxing sent police to the Quanjiayu area to collect donations for the defense of the households. The area is in a mountain village, and most of the people are ignorant. The police officers did not properly persuade them, leading to disputes with Zhang Mingyou's wife, Chen Hequan's mother, Chen Jichou's mother, and others, who were all arrested and taken to the station. Shen Zhiming, the chief of the branch, without investigating clearly, hastily detained them and abused them with torture, causing a pregnant woman who was six months along to have a miscarriage. On the 24th, many villagers protested, demanding the release of the detained suspects. Unexpectedly, the branch not only refused, but also opened fire as a warning, which aroused the public outrage of all the townspeople. On the afternoon of the 24th, they all closed their doors and went on strike. In addition to carrying the injured woman to the court for examination of her injuries, they also sent representatives to the city to petition. The Public Security Bureau has now sent inspector Sun Yongji to handle the matter, and has also worked with the district chief to persuade the shops to open the market that day.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Cocoon Businesses Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>The silkworms in the four townships of Jiaxing have all passed their major sleep, and the early ones have already been moved onto the cocoon frames. In an instant, fresh cocoons can be declared on the market. It is found that there are more than 30 cocoon businesses in the county that are preparing to open. They are now arranging everything and preparing to collect cocoons. It has now been decided by the cocoon industry conference that the opening date of each cocoon factory will be from May 30 to June 2. Because each cocoon merchant has prepared cash to collect cocoons, the price coupons for the cocoon market relief discussed by the Silkworm Industry Improvement Committee have been suspended from issuance.</p>

<h3>Citizens' Opinions</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Municipal Council convened a rent reduction movement discussion meeting at 87 Jiaozhou Road.

Then, Cao Zhigong from the First Special District Citizens' Federation and Mao Yun from the Second Special District Citizens' Federation spoke successively, generally saying that since the January 28th incident, the people's livelihood in this city has been extremely dilapidated. In recent years, it has been affected by the world's economic recession. The commercial sector of this city is in the final struggle. Moreover, recently, prices have been falling without exception. Only rent remains increasing. In order to prosper Shanghai's industry and commerce, reduce the burden on 3 million citizens, it is necessary to reduce rents to save the dying market and enable Shanghai's prosperity to recover as soon as possible. This is the motive of the association's rent reduction movement and what 3 million citizens are eagerly hoping for. Finally, the chairman announced that the opinions of the representatives will be compiled and discussed publicly. In the future, opinions will be expressed in writing or further meetings will be held until 6:00 PM, when the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Landlords' Written Statement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association formally submitted a statement to the Municipal Council expressing its opinion on the rent reduction issue, saying that Shanghai is a place where industry and commerce converge, with a population of nearly 4 million. The urban area occupies hundreds of square miles. Including the concessions, the prosperous area, excluding public use and roads, is no less than 100,000 mu in terms of acreage. The average price per mu is 10,000 yuan, worth about 100 billion yuan, but in reality, it is definitely more than that. In the past, there were no statistics on construction. According to a report by Puyi Real Estate Company, new construction in the last eight years has been worth about 50 billion yuan. Adding in old buildings, it should be around 200 billion yuan. With a land price of 100 billion and a construction cost of 200 billion, it occupies the largest and unparalleled figure in Shanghai's economic statistics. However, Shanghai's real estate owners are completely different from those in the interior. Landlords in the interior must first have surplus wealth before they can acquire property and pass it on to their descendants, guarding their business for generations. Moreover, the deed tax is heavier and transfers are less frequent. Shanghai, on the other hand, is entirely a commercial business. With a deposit of 30% to 40%, one can purchase property and mortgage 60% to 70% of the loan to Chinese and foreign merchants. Selling when the price is right, the deed is equivalent to movable property, and transfers are very easy. After the transfer, the mortgage remains the same. Now, with a total of 300 billion yuan, excluding the few properties owned by Chinese and foreign landlords and various banks that do not require mortgages, the remaining scattered households are estimated to be at least two-thirds, with an average mortgage of 60%, requiring 120 billion yuan of credit. These 120 billion yuan of loans are nothing more than being spread among Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, using this 200 billion yuan of collateral as the largest and only circulating chip, and are especially inseparably related to Shanghai's financial circles. In the past, land prices were still low, and mortgage interest was also small. The scope of commercial land and residential areas had not yet expanded. The population increased day by day, and demand exceeded supply. Although rents were cheaper than today, the interests of landlords were thicker than today. In recent years, new construction has increased suddenly, and land prices have also soared. All construction is for the purpose of competing for business, with drawings striving for novelty, engineering striving for solidity, and sanitary equipment striving for completeness. The cost has doubled compared to the past, so although rents are higher than in the past, the interests of landlords have become thinner than in the past. Recently, factories in the eastern district have declined, and the commercial sector in the central district is even more sluggish. The northern district has not yet recovered from the war. Only the western district has expanded far, and the residents' livelihoods are difficult, often moving from large houses to small houses, and renting out houses by the room. As of today, Shanghai's housing has a clear image of oversupply. Under this environment, landlords, as long as they can automatically reduce rents, are doing so without exception. Try to compare the rent prices three years ago with today's rent prices, and then compare the houses three years ago with today's houses. It can be seen that landlords have no profit to speak of. Furthermore, with today's mortgage interest, foreign merchants are generally at 8.5%, and Chinese merchants are generally at 1%. Regardless of whether the house can be fully rented out, the interest burden must be paid on time without any delay. Therefore, the current situation of landlords is that those at the top can slightly have a surplus after paying interest, those in the middle can only use rent to cover interest, and those at the bottom have more vacant houses, and the rent is not enough to cover the mortgage interest. Therefore, there are countless people who have suffered losses, which is more severe than the decline of other industries. Because other industries can reluctantly close down, the burden of real estate owners is so heavy that it cannot be avoided and cannot be escaped. It has become one of the biggest problems in Shanghai's economic decline. The impact of this is not only on the direct landlords. How much of a position does the aforementioned 120 billion yuan mortgage occupy in the financial market? If there is a shake, it is unimaginable. This is one thing. Shanghai landlords also run other businesses, often using profits from one to support the other, leading to joint prosperity. If the real estate industry is unsustainable, the business they operate will have no reason to stand alone. The phenomenon of a worse market situation in the future will be hundreds of times worse than today. This is the second thing. The owners of the houses that have already been built are known to everyone. Who would be willing to invest in construction again? It is not just the landlord's angry talk, but all new construction will actually stop. Then, how will the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of carpenters and other workers be secured? This is the third thing. After the war in Zhabei, the authorities are planning for revival, rewarding and guiding in every way. Now, without adding statistics, blindly reducing rents, one more new building means one more landlord who suffers losses. Guiding the people into water and fire is no different from heading north while driving south. Then, Zhabei will never have hope of revival. This is the fourth thing. Various industries are in a precarious situation, and they should understand each other. It is impossible to let the real estate industry alone fall into the abyss, directly affecting finance and indirectly affecting society. It must be known that everything is at peace in the heart. Try to look at the ratio of the cost of today's real estate industry to the rent, and then the question of whether the rent reduction is established will be answered without saying more. Try to put yourself in the shoes of the tenant and the landlord, and you will surely be able to judge right and wrong with a fair mind. Your council advises on municipal affairs and is entrusted by the people of all industries. If you seek the prosperity of all industries, you must first seek the equality of all industries. There is no need to suppress or exaggerate the importance of any of them.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Arrives in Shanghai; Will Go to Guizhou and Yunnan for Inspection in One Month</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that Huang Shaoxiong, the Minister of the Interior, went to the northwest to inspect civil administration this time, lasting two months. After returning to Nanjing, he went to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once. He has finished his business on the 23rd and returned to Shanghai, and will take a short rest. He plans to go south to Guizhou and Yunnan in about a month to continue his inspection. There are external rumors that the central government sent Huang to lead troops to Xinjiang. Huang himself denied the matter. As for the results of the inspection of the Northwest, it is heard that Guang did not stay in the Shaanxi area for long. Although the stay in Gansu was long, Huang suffered from a foot disease (known to Westerners as "Hong Kong foot") in Lancheng, so he did not go out for detailed inspections, only briefly meeting with relevant personnel and inquiring. Therefore, although the results obtained cannot be considered extremely detailed, they are still quite complete. The rural conditions in the Northwest have been suffering from continuous natural disasters, such as droughts and earthquakes, since 1920. In 1924, there was also the suffering of war. The hardship of the past ten years can be imagined. In the past year or two, the Northwest has been able to breathe slightly. As for the development of the Northwest, it cannot be achieved by empty words. The people in the Northwest mostly think of migrating to the southeast, but today the people in the southeast are only talking about going to the Northwest for development. How can they endure this hardship? Therefore, the development of the Northwest cannot be achieved without the central government having real economic strength and appropriate measures. As for the issue of reforming the provincial system, this matter cannot be done in a short period of time within the year. Whether officials are good or bad cannot be determined by whether the local government can be managed well just by changing the provincial system. It still depends on the talent of the officials.</p>
<h3>Denial of Through Traffic Agreement by Diplomatic Sources: Speculation in Telegrams from Peiping</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of through traffic in North China, and reports from Peiping stating that ten measures have been decided upon, newspaper reporters yesterday specifically visited a high-ranking diplomatic figure in Shanghai. According to this individual, all of the reported information is merely outside speculation and should not be trusted. It may be that the *Yi Shi Bao* and *Ta Kung Pao* newspapers in Tianjin had such reports and commentaries, which were then misinterpreted and spread. The current issue hinges on the decision of the central government. If the central government decides against it, there is no need for discussion. If it decides in favor, principles must first be established. Then, the responsible agency or local authorities, based on the central government's intentions, will draft detailed and specific measures to be submitted to the central government for approval before implementation. This is the necessary procedure in administration, and it is absolutely not something that local authorities can handle independently. As for the postal service issue, although the League of Nations advisory committee has established three principles, it is still unknown how each country will implement them. Our country is currently observing how each country will handle administrative and technical aspects to use as a basis for the future. However, even if our country adopts the same methods as other countries, it will certainly be stricter than any other country, absolutely avoiding any suspicion of endorsing counterfeits.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu's Trip North; Expected to Return to Post in Mid-June; Yin Tong to Report to Nanking First</h3>
<p>Yin Tong, Director of the Peiping-Ninghsia Railway Bureau, has been in Shanghai for several days to meet with Huang Fu and discuss matters such as through traffic in North China. After reaching a concrete agreement, Yin will first go to Nanking to meet with Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, and Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, to report on everything and seek instructions. He will then return north to his post. Huang Fu will remain in Shanghai for several more days and may meet with Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi. His trip north is expected in mid-June. Yin's movements in Shanghai have been quite discreet, as he does not wish to make any statements to the outside world before the agreement is finalized.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Proclaims Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government instructing various provincial and municipal governments to strictly prohibit potent narcotics such as morphine, cocaine, heroin, red pills, and white powder, the Shanghai Municipal Government, upon receiving the instruction, immediately issued instruction number 9625 to the Municipal Police Bureau to comply. The Municipal Police Bureau yesterday specifically copied the original document and posted it as proclamation number 30 in the streets so that everyone would be informed. The text of Chairman Chiang's instruction and the "Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics" were published in this newspaper on the 19th of this month with a special headline.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Informs Ministry of Finance That Issuance of Shipping Industry Bonds Is Suspended; No Funds Available from Customs for the Huge Sum of Ten Million Dollars</h3>
<p>This year, the shipping industry is depressed, with all routes experiencing an excess of ships and a shortage of cargo, leading to a surplus of tonnage. Shanghai shipping merchants, at the previous Ministry of Communications conference to promote the shipping industry, proposed issuing shipping industry bonds for ten million dollars, secured by customs tonnage dues and surplus. This was approved by the Ministry of Communications, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. Recently, various shipping companies in Shanghai have been hoping that the government would announce the issuance of shipping industry bonds soon, so that the declining business could be revitalized. However, today they received instruction number 2232 from the Ministry of Communications stating that at the previous shipping conference, the shipping merchants had requested the central government to issue shipping industry bonds for ten million dollars. The Ministry of Finance responded with document number 4582 stating that all customs revenue is designated for specific purposes and that it would be difficult to use the surplus to secure shipping industry bonds for ten million dollars. This case is difficult to handle as requested. The Ministry of Communications has notified various shipping companies in this city to take note.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Consortium Undertakes a Two Million Dollar Loan for Yellow River Control in Honan Province; Secured by Ministry of Finance Salt Tax Surcharge; Draft Loan Agreement Already Prepared</h3>
<p>According to the *Shen Shi Pao*, the Henan Provincial Government, in order to complete the Yellow River project in the province, recently approached six banks in Shanghai, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank, for a loan of two million dollars. An agreement has been fully negotiated, secured by the financial salt tax surcharge, to be repaid in two and a half years. The contract can be formally signed within days. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Substitute Loan for Yellow River Control Project</h3>
<p>The Henan Provincial Government and the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee originally planned to borrow four million dollars from the banking community to thoroughly complete the post-disaster project of the Yellow River in the Henan region. Later, for the sake of economic savings, a revised method was decided to raise two million dollars first. This time, taking advantage of the fact that Kong Xiangrong, director of the work-relief group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Association, came to Shanghai from Henan, he consulted with Kong Xiangxi nearby to approach the Shanghai banking consortium for the loan. At the same time, the director of the Henan Provincial Department of Finance also came to Shanghai after attending the National Financial Conference to formally negotiate the loan method with the banking consortium in the name of the Henan Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Loan Undertaken by Six Banks</h3>
<p>According to information obtained by the *Shen Shi Pao* reporter from various banks yesterday, after several days of consultation, the loan has been fully decided. The banks undertaking the loan are the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Bank of China, and three others. The loan amounts are: Central Bank 700,000 dollars, Bank of China 300,000 dollars, Bank of Communications 250,000 dollars, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank 225,000 dollars, Jin Cheng Bank 225,000 dollars, and Henan Agricultural and Industrial Bank 300,000 dollars, totaling two million dollars. The Central Bank will act as the representative bank, responsible for submitting the loan funds.</p>
<h3>Contract to Be Signed Within Days</h3>
<p>Now that the loan has been fully agreed upon by both parties through the introduction of Minister Kong, the collateral has been determined to be the salt tax surcharge of Henan Province, to be signed by the representative of the Henan Provincial Department of Finance with the banking community, and the Ministry of Finance will be responsible for guaranteeing everything. The term is two and a half to three years, to be repaid in installments. The draft contract has now been prepared, and will be formally signed when the Director of Finance of Henan Province comes to Shanghai after attending the National Financial Conference. All funds will be collected by the Central Bank and remitted to Henan, except for the Henan Bank's funds, which will be sent directly by that bank.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangrong to Visit Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, director of the work-relief group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and has been assisting in negotiating the post-disaster work funds. The reporter learned from the Flood Relief Association yesterday that Kong has left for the Soviet Union as the funding for this project has been secured. He will return to Shanghai in the next day or two, and is scheduled to return to Kaifeng at the end of this month to begin the post-disaster reconstruction of the Yellow River. He will also continue to visit provinces like Shandong and Hopei to complete the entire Yellow River relief work as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Domestic Rice Sales Surge After Tax on Foreign Rice; Difficult to Implement Immediately in Kwangtung and Kwangsi</h3>
<p>In recent years, various domestic rice-producing regions have been able to achieve bumper harvests. However, due to the dumping of foreign rice, grain prices have fallen, harming farmers. Shanghai is the hub for the transportation and sale of rice, and most rice merchants have also been affected by the dumping of foreign rice, causing the rice industry to decline. The government, in order to save the rice market and revive rural areas, has issued a general order to all customs houses at seaports to increase taxes on foreign rice. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Gu Xinyi, a leading figure in the rice industry in Shanghai, yesterday to inquire about the sales of domestic rice since the imposition of the foreign rice tax. According to the conversation, which was quite detailed, the information is recorded separately as above:</p>
<h3>Reduced Sales of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>According to Gu, the biggest reason for rural bankruptcy and industrial decline in recent years is the dumping of foreign rice. In recent years, the country has become stable and agricultural products have had good harvests. However, the rice produced domestically cannot compete with foreign rice. Therefore, farmers and rice merchants in various places have repeatedly appealed to the government to increase taxes on foreign rice. Since the Ministry of Finance issued a general order to all customs houses to implement the collection of taxes, foreign rice has not been able to be dumped in the country as it had been in the past. According to the current tax regulations for foreign rice, a tax of about 3.20 dollars in national currency should be levied on each stone (i.e., 150 catties). The price of foreign rice should be more expensive than domestic rice. Therefore, the amount of foreign rice has decreased recently.</p>
<h3>Tax Collection Situation in Fukien Province</h3>
<p>Gu also stated that now all seaports in North China and the Kiangsu and Chekiang areas are fully collecting foreign rice taxes, so the import of foreign rice has been decreasing daily, and the sales of domestic rice have been increasing. Now, the central government is working on making transportation more convenient and reducing transportation costs, and also exempting various local taxes, so the future of domestic rice sales can be optimistic. However, during the Fukien Incident, domestic rice was almost unsalable. Kwangtung and Kwangsi also could not levy foreign rice taxes, so domestic rice could not compete with foreign rice for sales, so the sales of domestic rice were not improving. Since the suppression of the Fukien rebellion, the government has prepared to collect foreign rice taxes, but at that time, because the local area had just been stabilized and everything was being managed, it could not be implemented immediately. The rice industry in this city has repeatedly petitioned Chairman Chiang to order the Fukien province to implement the collection of foreign rice taxes as soon as possible. The province has first collected half of the foreign rice tax rate set by the Ministry of Finance, so in the past few weeks, the average daily amount of domestic rice sold in Fukien from Hunan, Wuhu, and this city has been about 10,000 packages. If Fukien can collect the full amount in the future, then the sales of domestic rice should improve even more.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Implement in Kwangtung and Kwangsi</h3>
<p>As for the collection of foreign rice taxes in Kwangtung and Kwangsi, although Chairman Chiang has repeatedly exchanged views with the authorities in those two provinces in order to implement it as soon as possible, it has not been possible to implement it immediately due to various reasons. According to past practice, the rice tax in Kwangtung and Kwangsi is not collected by the customs, but by a separate agency organized by the local government. In the event of military rice imports, a blanket exemption is allowed, so merchants can contact the military and import rice into Kwangtung and Kwangsi in the name of military rice in order to make huge profits. All of these are reasons why domestic rice cannot be transported and sold in Kwangtung and Kwangsi. Chairman Chiang has agreed in principle that all foreign rice</p>
<p>Tax revenues should be allocated for provincial use, but the Kwangtung authorities believe that once the foreign rice tax is levied, the domestic rice tax should be completely exempted in order to allow domestic rice to be sold smoothly in Kwangtung and Kwangsi. However, if domestic rice is sold smoothly, it will be difficult for foreign rice to be imported, and the revenue from foreign rice taxes will inevitably decrease, which will affect local revenue. Therefore, it is generally difficult to expect this matter to be implemented immediately in Kwangtung and Kwangsi.</p>
<h3>After the General Strike of Workers at British-American Tobacco Factories, the Company Hired White Russians to Work Yesterday; Strike Committee Discusses Countermeasures; Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Mediation</h3>
<p>According to the *Ta Kung Pao*, after all employees of the British-American Tobacco New Factory in Pootung launched a general strike the day before yesterday to support the workers of the old factory, the company hired White Russians to replace them yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau, considering the severity of the labor unrest, requested instructions from the Municipal Government. The union yesterday sent letters to all sectors requesting assistance and held a second strike committee meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Hiring White Russians</h3>
<p>More than 5,000 workers and Chinese staff of the British-American Tobacco New Factory have been on strike since the day before yesterday (24th) to support the workers of the old factory. Yesterday morning, the company sounded the whistle and started the machines as usual, but all the workers continued the strike and none entered the factory to work. However, the company has had difficulties with the fire-stoking and machine management problems since the workers in the engine room and boiler room went on strike, so yesterday they specifically hired more than 30 White Russians to enter the factory to replace them. However, the White Russians are all amateurs, so there are difficulties in their work. It is reported that the strike committee has decided to devise appropriate countermeasures against the White Russians entering the factory.</p>
<h3>Current Status of the Strike</h3>
<p>After all the workers in the factory went on strike, work in all departments of the company has been completely suspended, and in the warehouses in Pootung, because the Chinese staff have joined the strike, the stored cigarettes cannot be shipped out. Yesterday, the company also sent three or five White Russians to the warehouses to take care of them. Otherwise, the British-American steam launches are still operating as usual. The union has now sent letters to the drivers to take immediate action and has sent a large number of maintenance teams to monitor the area around the factory gates and docks to prevent any breaches of discipline and avoid accidents.</p>
<h3>Strike Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The strike committees of the new and old factories held a second strike committee meeting at the association's headquarters yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. to discuss how to deal with the White Russian workers and what measures to take next. 39 strike committee members were present, chaired by Chen Peide. After reporting on the documents from higher authorities and the strike situation, the following motions were discussed: (1) Motion that steam launch drivers and chefs should express the same opinion. Resolved: Passed. (2) Motion on how to deal with the company's hiring of White Russian workers to replace them. Resolved: (Omitted) (3) Motion that the strike maintenance team monitor the area around the factory in shifts every day. Resolved: Referred to the Maintenance Section. (4) Motion that the female propaganda team immediately go to various districts to conduct propaganda. Resolved: Passed. (5) Motion to send letters to the Pootung Association and various unions requesting assistance. Resolved: Passed. The rest omitted.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Order</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday issued an order to the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union stating that the union had submitted a request for instructions on the resolution of the situation in which the British-American Tobacco Company suddenly closed its first factory in Pootung for no reason. The Bureau has been informed of the request and has requested instructions from the Municipal Government, which has ordered it to inform the union that it is currently persuading the company to find ways to reopen the factory. In addition to continuing to submit requests for instructions, the Bureau orders the Union to be informed. This order, dated May 22, 1934, is signed by Wu Xingya, Director of the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Mediation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, after receiving reports from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union that the British-American Tobacco Company had suddenly closed its first factory, believes that the livelihood of the workers is at stake, and has scheduled to convene the responsible persons of the union this morning to discuss the matter, and has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to convene both labor and management to implement mediation. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau, upon receiving the order, has scheduled to convene both parties for mediation on the 29th of this month, and has sent a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters requesting them to send personnel to attend the meeting. It is also learned that Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, believes that the labor unrest at the British-American Tobacco Company is serious, and specifically sent a telegram to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government yesterday ordering them to properly plan and dispose of the matter to avoid the expansion of the dispute.</p>
<h3>Request for Assistance</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union yesterday sent a letter to the Pootung Association stating: (Omitted above) We respectfully request that the British-American Tobacco Company in Pootung suddenly closed the old factory for no reason on May 12, causing more than 3,000 workers to suddenly become unemployed. The various departments of the new factory also have plans to continue to close the factory in preparation for resistance. There are more than 8,000 workers in the new and old factories. If their livelihoods are ruined one day, not only will our union members be in danger, but the entire Pootung market will also be unbearable. Your association loves your hometown and will not stand idly by. Our association, on behalf of 8,000 workers, earnestly requests that you uphold justice and speak out for righteousness, so that the turmoil can be quelled as soon as possible and the market can be restored as soon as possible. If you agree, our union members will feel the grace of rebirth, and the elders of our hometown will also offer incense and worship forever. We cry out and submit our case, and beg you to understand. The association has also sent letters to all unions in the city and other organizations requesting spiritual and material assistance.</p>
<h3>Strict Prevention of Sabotage</h3>
<p>The strike committee has organized a workers' maintenance team, and the organization methods are as follows: (1) The maintenance section has one section director, one general captain, 15 company commanders, 15 squad leaders, 30 deputy squad leaders, one general secretary, and one secretary. (2) The section is the highest authority. The section director and general captain implement the decisions of the section meeting. (3) The section director is responsible for all internal and external actions. (4) The general captain is responsible for all matters of the team. (5) Team members obey the orders of the squad leaders and deputy squad leaders, squad leaders and deputy squad leaders obey the orders of the company commanders, and company commanders obey the orders of the general captain and section director. (6) Each responsible person is responsible for their own autonomous actions. (7) Each team member works in shifts every day.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Hosts a Banquet for the Tsingtao Inspection Group Yesterday; The Inspection Group Hosts Reporters Today; And Is Scheduled to Host a Return Banquet for All Sectors Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the Tsingtao Industrial Inspection Group came to Shanghai, they inspected various national goods factories. Yesterday afternoon, the mayor hosted a banquet in the city center to receive the group. The group will host the press today and a return banquet for all sectors tomorrow, both to be held at the New Asia. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Itinerary</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., the group was still accompanied by Wu Dujian, a clerk of the China Industrial Federation, to the American-Asian Silk Factory, where they were led by General Manager Cai Shengbai to visit various departments. After the Municipal Government's lunch banquet, they went to the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 3 p.m. At 7 p.m., the Shengda Woolen Factory, Dalong Woolen Factory, and Silk Industry Bank held a public banquet at the Shanghai Friendship Society. Wang Yansong delivered a welcome speech, followed by a reply speech by the group leader Zhan Jingtang. It ended at 10 p.m.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Reception</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 12 noon, the Municipal Government held a reception in the central auditorium to receive all members of the inspection group. Those present included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and bureau directors Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Wen Hongsi, Jin Liren, Li Ting'an, as well as Municipal Party Department Tong Xingbai, and industrial and commercial leaders Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Guo Shun, Guo Le, Lu Wenshao, Xu Jizhi, Lin Kanghou, Hu Xiyuan, Cai Shengbai, Fang Yixian, Wu Yunshu, Lu Bohong, Chen Xiaodie, Zhang Zilian, Shen Jiucheng, and more than 50 others.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Speech</h3>
<p>During the banquet, Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a welcome speech, stating that the underdevelopment of China's industry and commerce is due to: (1) restrictions on tariffs, (2) being bound by unequal treaties, (3) the prevalence of foreign goods, (4) foreigners being able to set up factories within the country, resulting in overproduction and industrial and commercial backwardness. In this time of international economic warfare, there is also a lack of completeness in organization. The government is aware of this, so it has established an Economic Committee, the purpose of which is to advance industry and commerce, and industrial inspections can especially promote the progress of industry and commerce. Your group's visit to the south this time is very meaningful and has a very important mission. Last year, the Shanghai Inspection Group visited Tsingtao and received generous hospitality. We hereby express our thanks. Your group's visit to Shanghai has been lacking in hospitality, and we deeply regret it. Then, group leader Zhan Jingtang gave a reply speech. It ended at 2:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Customs Reduces Export Tax on Eggs Starting Yesterday; Six-Month Trial Period</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Egg Industry Association stating that the quantity of egg exports has declined and requesting protection. The Chamber immediately sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting a reduction in the export tax on eggs to protect the egg industry. The original text has been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has already replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The original text is recorded below: We have been informed of the telegram. Regarding the export tax on eggs and egg products, the ministry has ordered the customs to handle it in accordance with the following tax reduction methods from May 25 of this year. The trial period is temporarily set at six months, in order to maintain the egg industry: (1) Dried egg yolk and dried egg white, undifferentiated dried eggs, and frozen wet egg yolk and frozen wet egg white, undifferentiated frozen wet eggs, etc., are changed to an ad valorem tax of 5% of the value; (2) Fresh eggs and fresh cooled eggs are taxed ad valorem at 5% of the value. Preserved eggs and salted eggs are reduced to one dollar in national currency per thousand. This order is being issued for your information.</p>
<h3>Mechanical Industry Association Submits a Request to the Ministry of Finance to Change the Import Tax on Zinc Oxide; Related to the Self-Sufficiency of Basic Industrial Raw Materials; Changing to a Specific Tax May Prevent Dumping</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical National Goods Factories Joint Association yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the National Tariff Commission to change the import tax on industrial raw materials from ad valorem to specific to prevent dumping. The original text reads, "Request to change the import tax on basic industrial raw materials from ad valorem to specific, to collect ten dollars per 100 kilograms, in order to protect domestic products. The letter from member Great China Rubber Factory states that zinc oxide is a basic industrial raw material, essential for the manufacture of paint, ink, matches, rubber, Western medicines, skin glue powder, etc. Without this material, it cannot be made. Recently, our country's light industry has been thriving, but zinc oxide is hindered by the abundance of certain foreign goods. No one in our country's market dares to take the risk of manufacturing it. However, our factory, in view of this basic raw material being crucial to other industries, and absolutely indispensable, has embraced a spirit of fearlessness and is engaging in manufacturing at the cost of sacrifice. Unexpectedly, at the same time that domestic products are being produced in large quantities, certain foreign goods have greatly reduced prices and are dumping in order to destroy them. Upon investigating the assistance for their dumping, it is an export government subsidy of more than 60 dollars per ton. When transported to our country, the ad valorem import tax is only one or two and a half percent. They can arbitrarily set prices and do not report the original price truthfully. Through all kinds of tricks, the tax is reduced by half. As for the domestic product of our factory, the original Canadian white lead is purchased from Canada, and the import tax is 10% of the value, requiring more than 30 dollars per ton. Hunan province white lead must pay local miscellaneous taxes. Transported to Shanghai, it is also in the range of 30 dollars per ton. In terms of raw material tax alone, it is equal to the import tax paid by certain foreign zinc oxide. When zinc oxide is manufactured and sold to various places, it is taxed for export again. In this situation, even with the same technology, it is absolutely difficult to compete. We only beg your association to present a request on our behalf to the Ministry of Finance and the National Tariff Commission to change certain foreign zinc oxide import taxes from ad valorem to specific, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from falsely reporting the original price, and to collect a specific tax of 10 dollars per kilogram per day, which is the same as certain foreign import tax rates. The matter is limited to mutual</p>
<p>The benefits and there is no excessive demand. Take this opportunity to correct the weights and measures and fractional taxes of the customs to appropriately increase the import tax in order to enrich the national treasury and save the crisis of basic industries. We are filled with anticipation and urgency. The association has learned that the basic industry for manufacturing raw materials is the mother of all industries. For the sake of survival, the Chinese people are working hard on this, but foreign goods, with the assistance of their government subsidies, are reducing prices and dumping, hoping to trap our national basic industries in a state of eternal ruin. According to the various points mentioned by the factory, they are still reasonable. Correspondingly, we are submitting the situation to you. We ask that your ministry examine and approve the modifications in order to maintain the national basic industries, which is truly a matter of public convenience."</p>
<h3>The Federation of Labor Unions' Petition Representatives for Reducing Import Duties on Artificial Silk Return to Shanghai Yesterday: The Ministry of Finance Plans Remedial Measures; Petition Results Quite Satisfactory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Industrial Federation, believing that China's extremely high import duties on artificial silk were causing increased costs for domestic silk fabrics, making it difficult to compete with foreign goods, dispatched representatives including Li Chushi and two others to Beijing some days ago to petition the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance. They returned to Shanghai yesterday, and according to them, the results of the petition were quite satisfactory. The Ministry of Finance has drafted three remedial measures: (1) Temporarily exempting import duties on artificial silk to reduce costs for domestic silk factories, thereby enabling them to compete with imported silk fabrics; (2) If the above method is difficult to implement, either reduce the import duty by seventy percent, or stipulate an ad valorem tariff method, limiting it to 50% of the value; (3) Directly establish artificial silk factories by the government to actively manufacture domestic artificial silk to achieve self-sufficiency. However, the above measures still need to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>Periodic Lottery for the Reconstruction Public Bonds: To Be Held on June 1st at HSBC Bank</h3>

It is now known that the third lottery has been scheduled for 4:00 PM on June 1st, to be held at the accounting department of HSBC Bank at No. 12 Bund.

<h3>The Central Government Orders the Municipal Party Headquarters to Rectify Unsound People's Organizations: One-Month Deadline for Completion</h3>
<p>The People's Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, in order to rectify unsound people's organizations, has promulgated eleven articles of rectification measures and yesterday ordered the municipal party headquarters to follow them. The order is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Central Government Telegram</h3>
<p>Upon investigation, the scope of organizations of people's groups in various places is extremely broad. Many of them are able to proceed according to law, but there are also many cases of unsound organization or internal disputes from time to time. The local party headquarters, in the absence of explicit regulations, cannot provide guidance for such groups. Continuing in this way would be detrimental to the future of the people's movement. In order to eliminate this drawback, special measures for rectifying people's organizations are promulgated to facilitate compliance and benefit progress. However, these measures are specifically for rectifying unsound or disputed organizations, and the reorganized guidance measures for reorganizing people's groups previously issued by the central government are specifically applicable to the reorganized groups of illegal groups. They are different in nature and have different functions. It is hoped that they will not be confused.</p>
<h3>Rectification Measures</h3>
<p>The rectification measures for people's organizations are as follows: (1) Any people's organization that has been established in accordance with current laws and regulations, but is unsound or has disputes, to an extent that has not yet reached the regulations for dissolution in accordance with the law, may be rectified in accordance with these measures. (2) When the commercial-level party headquarters in various places considers that the people's organizations under its jurisdiction meet the requirements of the preceding paragraph and need to be rectified, it shall list the reasons and submit them to the higher-level party headquarters for approval, and then notify the government at the same level to order rectification. (3) When ordering the rectification of people's organizations, governments at all levels should notify the party headquarters at the same level to send personnel to provide guidance. When people's organizations receive government orders for rectification, they must also report to the local senior party headquarters. (4) When the senior party headquarters in various places receives a government rectification notice, it should immediately send personnel to provide guidance. (5) The rectifiers of the people's organization should be appointed by the local senior party headquarters from among three to five members of the organization. (6) The rectifiers of the people's organization should establish an office in the original location of the organization, and under the guidance of the party headquarters instructor, carry out all rectification matters. (7) The rectification time for people's organizations is limited to one month. In special circumstances, the local senior party headquarters may be requested to extend it appropriately, but the extension period shall not exceed ten days. If the instructor and rectifiers are unable to complete the guidance and rectification of the people's organization within the extended period, they shall all be withdrawn and other personnel shall be sent to guide the work. The time limit shall not exceed one month. (8) The work of the rectification office of the people's organization is limited to the internal rectification matters of the organization. (9) The implementation procedures for the rectification of the people's organization shall be formulated by the rectifiers of each organization and submitted to the local senior party headquarters for approval and implementation. (10) The rectifiers of the people's organization shall report to the local senior party headquarters and the government for record-keeping at the beginning of the work and at the end of the mission. (11) These measures shall be promulgated and implemented by the People's Guidance Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<h3>Exhibits From Shanghai National Product Factories at the Ministry of Industry's National Products Exhibition Are Detained: Zhang Zilian, Ma Jisheng, and Others Depart for Beijing Last Night to Request the Ministry to Approve Tax-Exempt Release as Precedent</h3>
<p>The National Product Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing is holding a spring national product exhibition in Beijing. The Shanghai National Product Factory Federation was previously requested to solicit member factories to transport their products to Beijing to participate in the exhibition, enjoying the preferential treatment of half-price fees under the Ministry's regulations. A very small number of exhibits were detained by the Ministry of Railways because they did not meet the cargo grade standards set by the Ministry of Railways, and were fined and ordered to pay supplementary transportation fees. The Federation presented the case to both the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways, but no solution has been found. The Federation believes that member factories are enthusiastic about promoting national products and are willing to travel and sacrifice, but they are suffering unnecessary losses and must reasonably request the return of the case. Therefore, based on the precedent of the Exhibition of Products along the National Railway Line in Peiping held by the Ministry of Railways this time, participation in the exhibition had stipulations of free transportation regardless of grade. The Federation's standing committee members Zhang Zilian, Ma Jisheng, Jiang Zhonghe, Gu Jiuru, and Zhang Shuren, etc., went to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways and Industry to request that they follow the precedent, should not discriminate, and should release the exhibits of this exhibition free of charge. They took the night train to Beijing last night to petition the Yuan and Ministry.</p>
<h3>YMCA Solicits Final Report: A Successful Celebration Banquet Was Held Last Night</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA's 34th Fundraising Campaign held a final report on its achievements at 7:00 PM last night in the East Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge. A banquet was held to celebrate the success. Prior to the event, major companies in Shanghai sent gifts and prizes for display, and the venue was brilliantly illuminated and quite spectacular. At 7:00 PM, the team leaders, team members, and committee members had all arrived, with approximately 150 people in attendance, making it a grand occasion. After the meal, the chairman of the YMCA, Mr. Cao Yunxiang, gave a thank-you speech, followed by a speech by the captain, Mayor Wu, and a report on the results of the fundraising campaign by the YMCA's General Secretary, Mr. Lu Ganchen. Finally, Mayor Wu personally presented the prizes. Among them were songs by students of the National Conservatory of Music, Hu Ran and He Shide, and Ms. Chang Wenbin, to add to the guests' enjoyment. The meeting did not end until 10:00 PM. The individual with the highest score in the fundraising was Mr. Zhao Shen, the member with the most associates was Mr. Ying Shugui, the one with the most new associates was Ms. Lin Keyi, and the one with the most junior associates was Mr. Shen Dehui. More than 70 other people raised more than 15 members. In total, the fundraising campaign recruited 2,155 members and raised 75,825 cents in membership fees and donations, exceeding the original goal, setting a historical record, and last night's meeting was the most grand of the YMCA's 30+ celebration banquets.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Holds Third Unveiling Ceremony Yesterday: A Total of 6,127 Points Were Obtained</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association held its ninth fundraising conference. The third unveiling of the results took place yesterday at 5:00 PM. Xu Maotang, Chief of Staff, Chen Runshui, and team leaders Mao Heyuan, Hong Yanbin, Ge Weian, Chen Zhonggao, Kong Zhaoyuan, Zhang Chao, as well as team members Li Jisun, Ni Rongtai, and more than 100 other people were present. Hong Yanbin was elected as the temporary chairman, Dong Xinqin was the master of ceremonies, and Zhao Kuiyi was the recorder. The ceremony proceeded as usual. First, the chairman gave a speech (omitted). Then, Zhang Shenzhi, the head of the association affairs, reported that 20,000 points had been obtained in the first two unveilings. Before this unveiling, the team leaders had already submitted more than 4,000 points, approaching the goal of 30,000. However, there are often fellow villagers who ask about the use of the points collected by the association. I will report on this together with the fundraising report. The association runs ten schools, and the number of students from our hometown reaches more than 3,000. In addition to student donations to offset expenses, the association needs to subsidize more than 10,000 yuan per year. Therefore, the association's fundraising conferences over the years can be said to be raising educational funds. Furthermore, the construction of the association building has been more than ten years ago and urgently needs repairs. Previously, Committee Member Zhang Jiguang proposed to raise 10,000 yuan for the repairs of the association building. Later, due to the severity of the Zhenhai flood disaster, and the reconstruction of the Ningbo Local Court Detention Center, which also required fundraising, this proposal was not implemented. Taking advantage of the ninth fundraising conference, we hope to raise 10,000 more points for the repairs of the association building, so that the magnificent building will not be damaged. I believe that all fellow villagers and team leaders will be happy to support this. After the chairman announced the results of the unveiling, the teams began to compete. As a result, Mr. Gui Fu of the Yarn and Cloth Team won first place with 520 points, Mr. Wu Yaqin of the Elementary School Team won second place with 514 points, and Mr. Cai Qinsun of the Bank Team won third place with 400 points. The captain of the general team awarded 100 points to the first team, 60 points to the second team, and 40 points to the third team. The teams were also very enthusiastic in submitting points, with a total of 6,127 points being obtained. For the entertainment, the Datong Music Society played two famous pieces, "Yang Guan Bai Xue" and "Spring River Flower Moon Night." The Star Film Company produced the national soul's revival.</p>
<h3>Yuan Feng and Other Firms Had Water Cut Off Yesterday: Request for Assistance From the Taxpayers' Association</h3>
<p>The 12th District Branch of the First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association yesterday, stating: Respectfully, according to reports from members such as Yuan Feng Firm at No. 1254 Avenue Edward VII, the members have been renting houses from the Ellder Company for many years. The initial rent was eight yuan, but it has now increased to twenty-one yuan. The landlord, however, is greedy and unsatisfied and wants to add another six yuan for water fees, starting from January of this year, to be added on a monthly basis. At this time of difficult circumstances and sluggish business, it is really unbearable. After jointly requesting the revocation of the order, both parties negotiated and agreed to increase two yuan per month, starting from June of this year. However, the landlord demanded it to be calculated from February, so it has not been resolved to this day. Unexpectedly, after the dispute over the water fee, the landlord stopped paying the water company, and on May 14, the company sent people to cut off the water. The tap is a public tap, not installed in each household. The members are willing to add two yuan, which is already exhausting. The water cut-off is really the fault of the landlord. Therefore, we specifically request your association to negotiate and provide compensation for the losses. We are endlessly grateful.</p>
<h3>Cai Wenyi's Appeal in the Case of Technical Assistant of the Public Works Bureau Was Rejected</h3>
<p>Cai Wenyi, a technical assistant of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, committed malfeasance in office. Taking advantage of his service opportunity, he defrauded Mrs. Chen Sun of 1,000 yuan. Later, Mrs. Chen Sun reported him to the local court, and Cai was arrested and prosecuted by the criminal court. After a trial, he was sentenced to eight months in prison. Cai refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the original trial court. A final court hearing had been held, awaiting the verdict. It is now known that the appeal was rejected. It is said that Cai is still not satisfied with the verdict and will appeal to the High Court again.</p>
<h3>Jiang Baorong Attempts Suicide by Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>At No. 211 Oriental Hotel</p>
<p>The National Little Luzon Hat Washing Shop on the Fourth Avenue, owned by a Jiang from Ningbo, is very popular among customers due to its excellent washing method, and its business is very good. Mr. Jiang has three sons. His eldest son works for the Public Works Bureau. His second son, named Baorong, is 21 years old, and his youngest child is still in swaddling clothes. However, the second son, Baorong, does not engage in proper work and spends money like water. His father and brother have repeatedly warned him without success. Yesterday afternoon, his father reprimanded him a few words. Afterwards, Baorong actually conceived the idea of death. He went to the Oriental Hotel, opened room 211, and secretly smoked heavy opium. The waiter discovered him and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that he has been poisoned for too long, and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>A Group of Buddhists to Travel to Japan: The Truth Behind the Humiliating National Assembly: All Are Taixu's Disciples Colluding With the Japanese</h3>
<p>A group of Chinese monks and lay people are traveling to Japan to attend the humiliating Second Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Conference. After being published in the Shanghai newspapers, it has aroused serious attention from the Chinese people. The Chinese Buddhist Association has also indicated that it will thoroughly investigate the matter. Now, the details of the matter, scattered in Chinese and foreign newspapers over the past few months, are compiled and disclosed to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>The Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Conference was initiated by Japan with the intention of becoming the leader of Eastern Buddhism, which complements its political ambitions. Therefore, when the first conference was held in Hawaii in 1930, China did not have official representatives attend. This conference in Japan is very interesting. The conference listed China and the puppet state of Manchukuo together, which shows the political purpose. After sending out the notice last autumn, the puppet Manchu representatives decided this spring (see February 25 and May 6, China and Foreign Daily News). The Chinese leader of the association, Fujii, colluded with Moxian, a disciple of Taixu studying in Japan, and sent hundreds of letters back to China to lure various parties with sweet words (see February 25 and May 8, China and Foreign Daily News). At the same time, the Japanese resident of Xiamen, Kanda Keun, contacted the South Fujian Buddhist Academy (see February 25, China and Foreign Daily News). Taixu first expressed his attitude that he could lead dozens of people to the meeting (see March 6, China and Foreign Daily News). From this, he appealed loudly, and Da Xing, a disciple of Taixu in Wuchang, replied with a letter dispatching five or six representatives (see February 25, China and Foreign Daily News). Among the Taixu disciples from various places are Xiamen representatives Chang Xing, Nanjing representatives Deng Xia, and Wuchang representatives Tan Xuan (see April 11, China and Foreign Daily News). The Taixu disciple in Chaozhou, Jichen, replied to the conference stating that he would recommend a representative (see the Chaozhou-issued "The Lamp of the Sea," issue 11, April 15). Finally, there was a decision that more than ten disciples of Taixu would be representatives (see May 8, China and Foreign Daily News). Currently, the Japanese Fujii is still traveling to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Beijing, detouring through Wuhan and Peiping, widely inducing people. It seems that this humiliating national action is entirely the result of collusion between Taixu's disciples and the Japanese. The facts are there and cannot be fabricated. Furthermore, Fujii said that this meeting will decide the century-old plan of Chinese and Japanese Buddhism (see May 8, China and Foreign Daily News). It is difficult to know whether the two sides have any other secret collusion. This matter is of great importance and should be thoroughly investigated by the Chinese people and cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3>Fire Truck Crashes Into a Large Tree; Nine People Severely Injured: Caused by Driving Too Fast; Two of Them Are Very Critical</h3>
<p>At 12:37 PM yesterday, the farmhouse of a farmer surnamed Lu at No. 2 Lai'an Bridge, Hongqiao Road, Huajie, near Haige Road, Shanghai West, with four bungalows, was suddenly burned due to careless cooking of lunch. Because the area is very close to the border between the Chinese and French concessions, in addition to the fire departments of various districts in the Chinese concession immediately hearing the alarm and driving to the rescue, the New Kaihe Fire Department of the French Concession also went to assist as usual. A. Coquelet, the deputy director of the Fire Department, led nine Russian firefighters, driven by Russian driver Lebelfi in the No. 8 leading vehicle, to rush to the scene at full speed. When the vehicle reached the corner of Avenue Joffre and Rue Ferguson to Zhao Bishop's Road, just as it was about to turn, because the roads in the area were paved with small stones and the vehicle was traveling too fast, the steering wheel became unstable for a while, and the vehicle crashed straight into the curb, colliding with the concrete poles and large trees on the side of the road. Because the brakes could not be applied in time, it collided with four large trees in succession, causing eleven people on the vehicle, except for the driver and the deputy director, to be thrown to the ground and severely injured. The two front lights, the left and right footrests, and the tires of the vehicle were damaged. After the accident, the local police station immediately notified the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road to send an ambulance to the scene and transport the nine injured people to the hospital. Of the nine firefighters, Tzorn and Trihotko were the most seriously injured. Tzorn suffered head and lung injuries and was bleeding non-stop, and his life was in danger. Trihotko also suffered severe head injuries and had already lost one eye. The next most seriously injured were Michikine and Kaviunoff, who both suffered head injuries. The other five people, Bastrakoff, Chihadze, Toutrine, Droujinine, and Tsoy, were less seriously injured. After being bandaged, they were able to leave the hospital. As for the No. 8 vehicle, the fire department arranged to have it towed to the Fire Department on Avenue Joffre for temporary storage, while the police investigated the cause of the accident to determine responsibility.</p>
<h3>New Contribution from Xiang Sheng Automobile Company: Invention of Rubber Spring Car Seats</h3>
<p>Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, a Chinese-owned business in this city and a leader in the taxi industry, has recently invented a type of rubber spring seat cushion for the comfort of its customers. These cushions are now being installed in succession. Regardless of how rough the road, they provide unparalleled comfort, eliminating any concern of bumps. It is said that these seat cushions are exquisitely manufactured and of considerable value. The company spares no expense in serving society meticulously. Due to a surge in business, the company's original fleet could not meet the demand, so a large number of new cars were purchased and will arrive in Shanghai successively in the coming days to join the service, preventing customers from waiting too long. It is also reported that the company is giving away telephone handset holders, limited to 30,000 units and will not continue the promotion after that. Over 20,000 units have already been given away, with only a few thousand remaining. Those who wish to receive a gift should contact the company as soon as possible to avoid missing out.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Runs Over and Kills Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, at the entrance of the New World on Nanjing Road and Tibet Road, a man of about thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, was walking on the side of the road. Suddenly, a public bus of a certain route came speeding from behind him. The man was unable to avoid it and was knocked down, immediately bleeding profusely and losing consciousness. Fortunately, a nearby police officer noticed and recorded the bus number, reporting it to the police station. He also sent the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died before help could arrive. Upon searching his person, only ten cents in small change and twenty copper coins were found, with nothing else. The hospital reported the incident to the police station, who transferred the body to the coroner's office while investigating the identity of the deceased.</p>
<h3>Northern Changsheng Guild Organizing Committee Regularly Checks New and Old Membership Rosters</h3>
<p>The Northern Changsheng Guild of this city, established for many years, has scattered its members. Since January of this year, under the instruction of the City Party Headquarters, eleven guild members, including Xu Shanchang, Jiang Fuchen, and Zhang Baofu, have been engaged in reorganization. The work is nearing completion. However, the existing membership roster (i.e., the industry registry) and the newly compiled membership roster still need to be checked. Yesterday, it was reported that the guild's organizing committee, following the instructions of the City Party Headquarters representative, regularly convened organizing committee meetings to jointly check the new and old membership rosters. It was also learned that the committee is scheduled to meet on June 3rd at 2:00 PM at its office located at 602 Fengji Lane, Guizhou Road, Nanjing Road.</p>

<p>Wuhua Bank Launches Five-Year Savings Plan Since Wang Jian'e took office as manager of the Wuhua Bank's Baxianqiao branch in this city, he has been actively preparing for its imminent opening. It is also learned that Mr. Wang has recently launched a five-year savings plan. Because most savings plans at ordinary banks have terms of ten or fifteen years, withdrawals and deposits inevitably lead to difficulties. The bank has shortened the term to five years. The calculation method uses a progressive or compound interest system. Withdrawals often involve odd decimals, so a generous interest is added to make the calculation an integer. For example, if you save five yuan per month, you can get four hundred yuan in five years. If you save one hundred and twenty-five yuan per month, you can get ten thousand yuan. This is in order of magnitude up to ten. With fixed-term savings at other banks, you must save more than one hundred and thirty yuan per month for five years to get ten thousand yuan. In comparison, there is a generous difference of four or five hundred yuan. This truly opens a new era in savings management.</p>
<p>Saint Anna's Garden Great Renovation Saint Anna's Garden, opposite Guangfeng Garden on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai, has been the only leisure venue for high-class ladies in Shanghai for many years.

This summer, the owner, Mr. Wang Xinhe, spared no expense and spent months preparing to transform the entire garden landscape. In addition to planting hundreds of flowers, he added the Summer Palace, Five Willow Pavilion, and so on. He also covered the tourist seats in the entire garden with flower tiles to prevent the seats from getting damp. The dance hall inside the garden has been specially expanded, half as large as in previous years. Dance partners can feel extra happy while dancing. The garden has now opened, and many tourists have come in recent days. It is reported that the owner, in order to popularize the garden, will provide superior refreshments for tourists every day from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, with affordable prices. All kinds of cold drinks before 8:00 PM will only cost thirty cents.</p>

<h3>Special Article Chen Zhuzun's Reply to Chairman Guang of Guangxi on Revising the Provincial Gazetteer</h3>
<p>Chairman Xuchu,</p>
<p>I received your kind letter yesterday and learned that your administration is healthy and that your virtuous plans are unfolding. I am deeply admiring. I especially admire your modesty and willingness to listen to humble opinions on the matter of revising the general gazetteer. I dare to respectfully offer my advice to you.</p>
<p>Literature in our province is declining, and there is a lack of talent. Since Zhu Xi, Lu Jiuyuan, Wang Yangming, and Peng Shaosheng, there have been no successors. Although there are some elders among the current staff, there are probably not many experts in gazetteer revision. The old provincial gazetteer was supervised by Governor Xie Qibi, and its framework and examples were the most refined. Therefore, its completion was the crown of provincial gazetteers at that time. Later, Ruan Yuan also followed his example when revising the Guangdong General Gazetteer. Today's scholars still praise it unabated.</p>
<p>Now, the complexity of current affairs has increased many times over the past. Adding to or subtracting from the examples requires careful consideration. And the scribes cannot be inferior to those of the past. Therefore, I believe that it is appropriate to hire more talents to complete the task, without being limited to people from this province. It would be best to be able to hire them to live in the pavilion and preside over everything. Even if they are unwilling to move south, it is possible to entrust them with writing. There are precedents for this in other provinces. This is the first thing I want to advise you.</p>
<p>Gazetteer revision cannot be done without materials. In addition to the items that need to be investigated on the ground, books are especially indispensable. There should be a great and rich library in the provincial capital for scholars to study. In terms of gazetteer revision, the gazetteers of various provinces, prefectures, and counties should be collected without omission for verification. This is the second thing I want to advise you.</p>
<p>The literary style in our province is far inferior to that of other provinces. Since recent years, the elders have passed away, and there are fewer and fewer people who can understand writing. If we do not promote it as soon as possible, there will probably not be enough Chinese teachers in high schools in the future. And among the people in general administrative agencies, those who can save their writing and make it clear will gradually become impossible to recover. Clarity of writing is not just writing. It must be that the thinking is organized before the writing is organized. Whether the writing is organized or not is a sign of whether the thinking is organized or not. Now, if most people in the province have disorganized writing, then most people in the province have disorganized thinking. How can people with disorganized thinking govern the world without chaos? Moreover, the culture of the country, the people of the country, do not even love themselves. The writing of the country, the people of the country, cannot even understand it. This is to destroy its culture and destroy its writing. Will it not destroy its language in the long run? Then the country will perish without others destroying it. Therefore, promoting science in our province today is certainly an urgent task, but promoting our inherent culture is also not to be delayed. If the gazetteer revision office can hire scholars from all over the world, they can also take on academic lectures in their spare time. This is the third thing I want to advise you.</p>
<p>I have received your respected photo and am very grateful. In your previous letter, you asked for my humble works for the museum. Once I have collected them, I will present them to you.</p>
<p>I wish you well.</p>
<p>Your brother, Chen Zhu, respectfully</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>How to Enhance Memory Answer to Mr. Weng Dashen</h3>
<p>Mr. Dashen wrote to inquire, "What methods can be used to enhance memory" so that "the books read are forgotten completely in less than two or three days?" This question is indeed a problem that many readers consider a hidden worry. In order to dispel the reader's "fear of difficulty" and increase their self-confidence, it is necessary to specifically present our views.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two reasons for poor memory: one is physiological defects, such as neurasthenia, and the other is disordered thoughts and inability to concentrate. Regarding the former, we do not want to explain too much, because although this is certainly not, as a group of missionaries said, God's will, that God punishes sinners and deliberately creates such an unhealthy brain, this is related to the entire social problem. Our physiological defects are caused by our environment. To remedy this defect, we must start by improving the environment, and then it would be a long story. Regarding the latter, however, is the focus of our discussion now.</p>
<p>Why are our thoughts confused? Why can't we concentrate our attention? The reason is very simple: on the one hand, due to our own lack of willpower, we cannot resist the temptation of the colorful social phenomena, and we have no way to find the way forward that we should take. Therefore, we seem to want to try everything, but as a result, we cannot raise interest in everything; on the other hand, the chaos in society causes extreme anxiety in life. We are constantly struggling with life. Imagine, how can we easily put our minds at ease and put them on books? When we were children, no matter how little we understood the meaning of the words in the book, we would not easily forget the books we had read. Later, as we got older, our thoughts became more complicated, and our memory gradually weakened. This fact shows the proportional relationship between memory and thought development, and at the same time shows that memory is not the most important component in the process of reading.</p>
<p>Based on the above explanation, we know that enhancing memory cannot be achieved by any mysterious method that has the power to "seize the creation of heaven and earth," but should seek its essential answer from the limitations of each person's actual conditions.</p>
<p>First, when we read a certain book or study a certain subject, we must have the greatest determination to deal with it with all our energy. Of course, when we choose a certain book or subject, we must decide from our own needs and from the needs of society, but after deciding, we should not consider other things when reciting. If we only have one hour a day to read, then we should immerse our whole body and mind in the book for this hour. We must not only see with our eyes, but also with our hearts, and we must not easily let go of every sentence and every word. (Literary works should be treated differently) The Western proverb "Play when you play, read when you read" can still be regarded as a motto for our reading.</p>
<p>Second, the so-called "not easily letting go of every word and every sentence" is by no means asking you to rigidly memorize every word and every sentence. This is useless and impossible. Even Liang Qichao, a "genius," admits that today's learning is not learning by memory, but learning by note-taking. Our reading does not fundamentally require "rote memorization," but understanding and being able to understand thoroughly. Therefore, when we read, we should use various methods to strive for a thorough understanding of any part of the book. When we read natural sciences, we must find more opportunities to experiment and make more specimens. When we read social sciences, we must observe reality more and use real-world problems as examples. In this way, the books we read will not be swallowed alive, but will be dissolved in your mind and become your own things. In this way, even for the words, "do not forget them completely in two or three days," but the essence of the book will never be forgotten. This principle is extremely obvious.</p>
<p>Third, after we have read a certain book in a certain subject, if we feel that we do not understand the content of the book very well or it is vague, we can read another work with the same argument, or even the third and fourth books. This is sometimes more effective than rereading a certain book. It is difficult to remember two people who meet once or twice by chance, but if they meet more often, the impression will naturally become deeper and not easy to disappear. Reading is also like this. In application, we should apply more actual problems to the same theory, and in research, it is very necessary to refer to and corroborate each other, and it is the best way to enhance memory.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that a person's weak memory is not enough to hinder his progress in reading. We can not only get remedies technically, but also reach the same effect as those with strong memory from other paths. We may say again and again that reading is not about "rote memorization," but about being able to dissolve, and being able to dissolve is true memory. Finally, we want to state that what is discussed here is for reading general theoretical books. When we have the opportunity, we will discuss separately how to memorize English words or how to read novels.</p>

<p>Sports News Patriotism Does Not Wish Future Generations to Lag Behind</p>
<h3>Opening Performance Order of China Tennis Club Changed Singles Xu Sunji vs. Lin Baohua Doubles Xu Qiu Cooperation vs. Lin Zheng Japanese Players' Performances All Canceled</h3>
<p>Tan Jingjun, who is enthusiastic about tennis, specially invested heavily to initiate the China Tennis Club to promote tennis in our country and cultivate tennis talents in our country. He donated more than ten acres of land on Singapore Road and built a large-scale tennis court. Before the Far East Games broke down, he had agreed that the Japanese Far East Games athletes would make a performance match at the court when they returned to their country via Shanghai to increase the tennis skills and interests of the Chinese people. The news has been seen in the previous report. However, bad news came that the long-established Far East Games was illegally disbanded by Japan and the Philippines. Anyone with a bit of spirit is indignant. Mr. Tan does not want future generations to lag behind in patriotism and deeply feels the meaninglessness of performing with Japanese players. He has decided to cancel all the agreed performance match order. The loss is not counted. However, the opening of the China Tennis Club is still scheduled to be held on Monday afternoon the 28th. Far East Games athletes from our country will perform on their own. The excitement may be better than competing against the Japanese. At the same time, female athletes from the Far East Games in our country will be invited to participate in the performance. The order has not yet been determined. Chinese people are patriotic and will surely express sympathy with Mr. Tan. The amended order is as follows:</p>

The men's track and field events are also largely completed, with Wan Zhu having a good grasp on the championship. Yesterday, in the men's Group A 100-meter final, Wan Zhu's Zhu Hongqi achieved a time of 11.5 seconds, close to the city's sports meet record, truly a promising talent. The details of yesterday's competition are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Overview of Track and Field</h3>
<p>Among yesterday's events, the 400-meter final was the most competitive. Shangwen's Hu Shihua's time of 1 minute and 1.4 seconds was a regression compared to previous years. The 800-meter preliminary rounds also garnered much attention. In today's final, Shangwen's Fu Yuanxiang has a better chance of winning. In the 100-meter final, Wan Zhu's Zhu Hongqi's time of 11.5 seconds is comparable to that of Su Xiaoru and others. With diligent practice, he could also become a good athlete. There has also been great progress in other track and field events. The women's group, except for the Group A 50-meter and Group C softball throw, has broken all previous records. The men's track and field events broke nine previous records yesterday. There are bound to be surprising records in today's 200-meter final as well.</p>

<p>Anecdotes from the Venue</p>
<h3>Weighing Athletes Is Difficult for Their Stomachs</h3>
<p>After the selection of athletes for the preliminary and semi-final rounds of men's and women's track and field events, weighing is required when there is suspicion of substitution, as a preventative measure. There were many male and female athletes who had to be weighed yesterday. Some were disqualified due to a difference of one pound, so each athlete was wary, even reducing their diet in the hope of trickery.</p>
<h3>Kindergarten Outfits Are a Battle of Wits</h3>
<p>The kindergarten student performances are of great interest to the audience. Yesterday's performers included the planting expression of Cangji, the "Fish are Good" of Private Shang Elementary School, the narcissus dance of Ai Qun, the rose flower of Minzhi, the circle division of Longde, the small soldiers of Chengdong, and the tiny stick of Hubei South. The costumes are bright, novel, and interesting. The competition among the schools is truly painstaking.</p>
<h3>Tears Flow When Names Are Not on the List</h3>
<p>During yesterday's women's 100-meter final, Xicheng's Liang Zhilin was narrowly defeated by a shoulder's length and took second place. In the women's 5000-meter Group C final, Shangwen's Zhu Fangmei was fourth. Both of them were filled with anger and could not help but shed tears.</p>

<h3>Scene of the Finals</h3>
<p>(Men's Group A 100 Meters) Wan Zhu's Zhu Hongqi is young and full of energy, starts legally, sprints powerfully, and leads from start to finish. Shangwen's Zhu Aixian is also fierce and amazing, staying shoulder-to-shoulder. Gao Lianbao is a famous player from He An, but unfortunately, his vigor has not subsided, but it is not easy to surpass Cui Tingfang and win third place. The result of 11.5 seconds makes the 11.8 seconds of the middle school joint sports meet pale in comparison.</p>
<p>(Men's Group A 400 Meters) Shangwen has many heroes. In the semi-finals, the three musketeers Hu, Fu, and Yao have already shown their mettle. At the sound of the starting gun, before reaching the halfway point, all the flags of Shangwen were visible on the track. As a result, the top three places were taken by Shangwen. Wan Zhu's Sun tried his best to win fourth place. (Men's Group A Shot Put) Tao Desheng's wrist strength is stronger than the rest. After three pushes, a result of 14.05 meters was achieved, breaking the previous record. The difference between Hua and Chen Liang was five inches, determining the second and third places.</p>
<p>(Men's Group A High Jump) A score of 1.58 meters broke the previous record. This creator is Gaoqiao's Sun Debao. The jumping posture is also very admirable.</p>
<p>(Women's Group A 50 Meters) Xicheng's Liang Zhilin is a short-distance running prodigy. Her sprint and stride are unmatched by the rest. After the starting gun, she is like a wild horse off the leash, moving forward bravely. Wuben's Zhang Yigui, Deng Guoxian, Jiang Jucai, and other youngsters couldn't catch up. This result of 7.8 seconds is more vibrant than the 8.1 seconds of the middle school joint sports meet.</p>
<p>(Women's Group A 100 Meters) Ms. Liang Shilin uniquely dominates the ambition of two short-distance runs. After the start, Wuben's Deng Guoxian immediately fell behind by a foot. After 50 meters, she ran faster and faster. After 80 meters, Ms. Liang had indeed passed Ms. Deng's chest. When reaching the finish line, Zhang Yigui and Zhang Suhua crossed the line shoulder-to-shoulder. The referees were dazzled and couldn't tell the difference. As a result, Deng Guoxian was judged to be first. So Ms. Liang was unjustly angry and burst into tears. This result was 14.6 seconds (breaking the previous record).</p>
<p>(Men's Group B and C 100 Meters) The first place in Men's Group B was originally occupied by Honglu's Gu Xueshi, but unfortunately, his weight exceeded the legal weight and he was dismissed, which is a pity. Zhou Zaixing added the championship to his resume. His joy can be imagined. In Men's Group C, Wan Zhu's Tan Jihao, small but brave, achieved a score of 13.8 seconds, which is still considerable.</p>
<p>(Men's Group B and C High Jump) Since Gu Xueshi was not allowed in the 100 meters, all his grievances were vented in the high jump event, seeking to be on the tiger list. Sure enough, where there's a will, there's a way. He firmly occupied the top spot with 1.375 meters. After Tan Jihao of Group C won the 100-meter championship, he was complacent and should have leaped to take the Group C hegemony.</p>
<p>(Women's Group B 50 Meters) Wuben's Xu Jinxiu is even more lovely than Group A's Liang Zhilin. The result of the 50-meter final was 7.4 seconds, surpassing Group A. Jin Xiaoju's sprint was quite reliable, but unfortunately, she didn't use it at the right time, which is a pity. Zhu Fangmei's posture has the flavor of Zhang Jieqiong, a female player from Guangdong Province. If given time, she will be a first-class material.</p>
<p>(Women's Group B 100 Meters) The championship also belonged to Wuben's Xu Jinxiu, with a score of 14.4 seconds, breaking the previous record, surpassing Group A, and matching the middle school joint sports meet, making it unparalleled for a time. However, during the competition, Zhu Fangmei's sister and Wan Zhu's Jin Xiaoju competed fiercely for the runner-up, with consistent steps, making it difficult to distinguish between them. The referees spent a lot of time arranging the finish line. After a long discussion, they temporarily set the first and second places, which caused disputes. Fortunately, it was soon explained and the misunderstanding was resolved.</p>

<h3>The Modern Thought Society Solicits Articles from College Students Nationwide The Topic is Whether Dictatorial Politics Can Be Implemented in China The Solicitation Period is from Now Until the End of June</h3>

The deadline for submission is from now until the end of June. It is said that the society, in order to be cautious, will invite Wang Yunwu, Pan Gongzhan, Yang Gongda, Wu Xingya, Chen Gaoyong, Wu Kaixian, Lin Zhongke, Tong Xingbai, Ding Mocun, Tao Baichuan, Ma Chonggan, Jiang Huaishu, and Hu Shuyi to form a judging committee to determine the grades. In addition to seeking handwritten couplets, calligraphy or silver cups, mirror frames, etc. from party and government leaders to give spiritual rewards to all the participating students, the society has also decided to award the first place with book coupons or 50 yuan in cash, and the second place and below will also receive material rewards. The selected articles will be compiled into a special book and published to the world, or the best ones will be published in famous newspapers in the country first. Manuscripts can be sent by registered mail to No. 288 Erkai, Fulili Road, Shanghai, for transfer.</p>
<h3>The Flourishing Atmosphere of the Nian Er Society in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Nian Er Society in West Shanghai is organized by teachers and students of Great China University and the people in the Fanwangdu area. Its purpose is to promote local goods, practice social thrift, strive for social production, develop the national economy, improve people's lives, and work together for the revival of the Chinese nation. Since its establishment last winter, it has successively established a local goods introduction center, a textile training center, a production cooperative, and a popular education experimental zone in Fanwangdu in cooperation with Great China University. In recent months, it has been thriving. There are now more than 50 members. It is reported that the society is scheduled to hold its founding conference and hold a swearing-in ceremony for all members at 9:00 am on the 27th of this month (i.e. tomorrow).</p>
<h3>Continuing Operation of the Li's Free School in Nanxiang</h3>
<p>The Li's School in Nanxiang was founded by Mr. Li Qinghao of this county. All enrolled children are given free textbooks and supplies, and the facilities are complete and the teaching methods are excellent. It is the most famous charitable education institution in Xiangdi. Unfortunately, during the retreat of the National Army on January 28th, it was ravaged by Japanese invaders and looted, destroying the school's achievements over the years. It is painful to mention. After the incident, Principal Li stopped running the school because the losses were too great. Recently, the school's alumni, in view of the fact that there are not a few people in this township who are unable to enroll in school, have repeatedly sent representatives to visit the principal and sincerely ask him to continue running the school in order to save it. Recently, it has been reported that Principal Li has approved it and decided to continue running the school next semester, and the desks and supplies have also been prepared.</p>

<h3>Light Telephone TelePhotoPhony</h3>
<p>— Knowing</p>
<p>First Picture Second Picture</p>
<p>"Light Telephone", such a novel term, I guess the reader is a bit confused! Today, I have only heard of telephones divided into wired telephones and wireless telephones, and I have never heard of light telephones. What kind of telephone is a light telephone? Its principle is based on sound films to make two remote places communicate in space. The sound waves of speech are carried on the light waves of light. The light waves are shone into a photoelectric tube (ｐｈｏｔｏＥｌｅｃｔｒｉｃＣｅｌｌ) on the other side. Due to the strength of the sound waves, the light waves also change in strength accordingly. The photoelectric tube receives the strong and weak light, so that the current in the circuit connected to the photoelectric tube also changes in strength. After being amplified by the amplifier, it becomes a powerful sound current, which is input into the loudspeaker to emit the sound waves from the original place.</p>
<p>The most important issue in light telephones is the light modulation method, that is, storing the sound waves on the light rays. The light modulation method introduced today is the simplest and most effective. Please view the light telephone transmission and reception diagram in the first picture. When the talker speaks into the microphone, the sound waves are amplified by the input eight amplifier to the loudspeaker. This loudspeaker is different from ordinary loudspeakers. Ordinary loudspeakers use it to emit sound. Here, its armature is used to control the intensity of the light from the light gate, so that the light from the light source through the condensing lens changes in intensity, turning the sound wave into the effect of a light wave. The light is then collected and shone on the photoelectric tube by a lens or parabolic mirror depending on the distance. The photoelectric tube is connected to a highly sensitive audio frequency amplifier (second picture) to turn it into a sound wave current, which is input into the loudspeaker to emit the speech from the original place.</p>
<p>The light source can be supplied by a direct current carbon arc lamp or a car light bulb to collect the light on the light gate for amplitude modulation. Within a suitable distance, the modulated light does not need a reflector and can be shone directly on the photoelectric tube. Dr. R. M. Sutton has experimented with shining the modulated light from the light gate directly on a photoelectric tube 1,000 feet away without using any lenses or reflectors. Therefore, if the lens and parabolic reflector are improved on the receiving side, it is not difficult to increase the distance by several miles.</p>
<p>According to the experiment results, in the lecture hall, the light source uses ordinary car light bulbs, which is suitable for transmitting powerful signals from one end of the room to the other. The distance between them is more than 100 feet. Dr. Sutton has used sunlight as a light source and used a light collector and lens to shine sunlight directly on the light gate for application.</p>
<h3>How to Improve a Radio - Replacing a Pentode Amplifier Vacuum Tube</h3>
<p>—Yong Yan</p>
<p>If a new pentode radio frequency amplification vacuum tube is used to replace the tetrode screen grid radio frequency amplification vacuum tube in a radio, the performance of the radio will definitely be significantly improved. For example, if you originally used a Type 35 or Type 24A, you can replace it with a Type 58; a Type 32 can be replaced with a Type 34; a Type 35 can be replaced with a Type 78. The replacement is very simple and there is no difficulty; anyone with a little radio production experience will definitely do it well. Now, because there are more users of AC radios, the replacement method is described above using Type 58 as an example. As for Types 34 and 76, follow this principle. Figure A is a one-stage radio frequency amplification using Type 24A, and Figure B is using Type 58. Observing these two figures, the only difference is that Figure B has an extra line from the cathode to the suppressor grid (Ｓｕｐｐｒｅｓｏｒｇｉｒｌ). Therefore, when replacing, you only need to replace the original five-pin socket with a six-pin socket. In addition, add a line from the cathode to the suppressor grid as shown in the figure: and replace the 1,500 ohm resistor used in the original 23A with a 300 ohm resistor. (The ohm number of this resistor refers to the use of one resistor for each vacuum tube) After this replacement, it may be difficult to generate oscillation; then slightly reduce the screen grid voltage connected to the 58 vacuum tube to avoid it. The benefits of using a pentode radio frequency amplifier tube are that in addition to the higher voltage amplification ability (when the screen voltage is the same as 250 volts, the voltage amplification coefficient of Type 58 is more than twice that of Type 24A); and it can receive higher signal voltages without overloading, because it has a suppressor grid to avoid Secondary Emission (ＳｅｃｏｎｄａｒｙＥｍｉｓｓｉｏｎ).</p>
<h3>865 Introduction to the Latest Power-Saving Vacuum Tube iA6 Single-Tube Superheterodyne DC Radio</h3>
<p>—KMK</p>
<p>The IA6 vacuum tube is the latest type of power-saving vacuum tube. It contains five grids inside, hence the name Pentagrid Converter. Its filament voltage is 2.15 volts and the current is 0.06 amps. The tube base has six holes, and there is a grid cap on the top of the vacuum tube (see the second picture). This vacuum tube is very suitable for superheterodyne radios, because one tube can perform the functions of detection and oscillation, etc. Its superior performance cannot be matched by other vacuum tubes. The first picture shows one of the most convenient ways to use the vacuum tube to make a superheterodyne radio. The first stage detection and oscillation are both performed by IZ6, and then a mineral (carbon compound type) is used as the audio frequency second stage detection, so that the electric wave rate transmitted from the antenna collides with the frequency emitted by its own oscillation stage to create a new frequency. However, this frequency is lower than the higher frequency and higher than the lower frequency, so it is called the intermediate frequency. It is most appropriate to take 175KC for this machine, because the sub-wavelength between 175KC is less than other places. In the first L picture, 4L5 is a 175KC intermediate frequency transformer. Its inductance must be matched properly and correctly, otherwise the oscillation will be difficult to stabilize. It is best to use an isolation cover for the vacuum tube to avoid noise and prevent (ｌｎｔｅｒｓｔａｔｅ) feedback rate. Pay special attention to the wiring in the machine, which must be arranged at right angles so that there is no mutual induction effect. The values of all other parts are outlined on the left.</p>
<p>L: Wind the coil on a 1 1/4-inch diameter plastic tube with 32-gauge enameled wire. L1: Wind 120 turns at a distance of 2 1/4 with the same gauge wire. LL: Wind 32 turns on a 1 1/4-inch diameter plastic tube with 36-gauge enameled wire. After the coil is wound, wind L3 on top of it with 90 turns with an insulator隔between the outer周. L4L5 are intermediate frequency transformers. C is a 0.00035 megahertz variable capacitor. CI is a 0.1 megahertz fixed capacitor. C2 is the same as C. C3 is a 0.0001 megahertz fixed capacitor. C4 is the same as C. C5 is the same as CI. C6 is the same as C. C7 is a 0.0005 megahertz variable capacitor. C8 is a 0.0001 megahertz fixed capacitor. R is a 450 ohm fixed resistor. RI is a 1 megohm fixed grid leak. R2 is a 32 ohm variable filament resistor. R3 is a 330000 ohm fixed resistor. CD is a sensitive compound carbon mineral.</p>
<h3>New Power-Saving Single-Tube Machine</h3>
<p>— Si Lian</p>
<p>There are quite a few families or listeners in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in China who have single-tube machines, and most of the vacuum tubes used are power-saving types, such as 1o9, -99, -30, etc. When inputting into the speaker, they are still too light. Even if a high-power vacuum tube is used, it is not very satisfactory, because there is only detection and no amplification. Now that there are composite vacuum tubes, this problem can be solved. Below is the circuit diagram of a single-tube machine. The vacuum tube is an IA6 pentagrid converter, which is also a power-saving vacuum tube. The filament voltage is 2 volts and the filament current is 0.06 amps, which is the same as the -30 type. LLI L2 is an ordinary three-circuit coil, C is a 0.00046 MFD variable storage capacitor, the grid leak R is 2me, gCI is 0.00025mfd, C is 0.002mfd, RI is 30000hms, C2 M.F.D., F is a 32/11 low-frequency transformer, RFC is 85MH, and the two voltages are four and a half volts. The upper half of this machine is used as a first-stage detector, and the lower half is used as a first-stage amplifier, so the volume is extremely loud.</p>
<h3>Internal and External News</h3>
<p>The Stewart radio, exclusively managed by the American Wireless Radio Company, is of solid quality. Its characteristic is that even though the weather is hot and other radios are easily disturbed by atmospheric electricity, causing the radio to be inconvenient to receive, only this machine can be free from atmospheric electricity and receive radio waves still from afar and clearly. The price is especially self-restrained, and it is truly an inexpensive and beautiful radio. In addition, the company has newly arrived various wireless radio parts, such as resistors, square grids, and electrical attachments, all of which are original parts. Those who need to purchase them are welcome to visit the company at No. 82 Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>The Zhongyong Wireless Radio Repair Department has recently ordered a large number of repair instruments from the American Quarto factory. This new type of instrument is a repair instrument that has never been seen in Shanghai. No matter what type of radio it is, it can be pointed out immediately after calibration. Therefore, the work can be exquisite and fast. The parts used are all ordered directly from Europe and the United States, so the fees are very low. If you have a radio that is damaged, you only need to notify by telephone, and the place will immediately send a technician to your house to check it, and no inspection fee will be charged. If you entrust the repair, you can also borrow a machine to avoid missing your favorite programs. After the repair is completed, it can also be guaranteed, which can be called a repair department with Shanghai's considerate service and perfect equipment.</p>
<p>Special News for Wireless Radio Repair The Yada Company Wireless Radio Repair Department at No. 24 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, is familiar to all comrades in the wireless radio industry across the country. It is heard that the repair work has become more busy recently, and it is necessary to increase talent and expand the location. The company is planning to add 12 repair stations throughout the city, which will be implemented soon. It also plans to entrust agencies in various ports along the Yangtze River, and welcome to ask for detailed rules. It is reported that the company has received wireless radio machines sent from remote ports for repair, including the Yunnan Postal Bureau, the Jiangxi Public Security Bureau, and Xiamen, Fuzhou, Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, Shanxi and other places, which can be said to be ubiquitous. Since the company added a wireless radio manufacturing department this spring, the machine parts received for ordering have been unusually crowded. The company's products, such as large and small power broadcasting stations, medium-wave wireless telephones, and short-wave portable telegraphs, all have unique features that are beyond the reach of ordinary products. The low price and considerate service are also the characteristics.</p>
<p>Statistics on Records Broadcast According to British statistics, the use of records for broadcasting accounts for 9.8% of the total broadcasting time. In Italy, it is 14.5%, in France, it is 28.4%, and in Belgium, it is 31.8%. The most is the Netherlands, which is 44.4%. According to the statistics of the Dutch Wireless Radio Association, it is believed that this index is too high. (Philips Company)</p>
<p>Near News from Tianer Wireless Radio Company The company has recently arrived a large number of Zengnizhi radios. This machine is of high quality and extremely durable. The company also has original parts, and the repair is very fast. Those who need to repair their radios during the rainy season can send them directly to the company on Shipipei Road.</p>
<p>The floor-standing radio of the Italian cruiser Naga was damaged in Japan, and no one there was able to repair it. After arriving in Shanghai, it was sent to the Great Shanghai Wireless Radio Company at No. 49 Nanjing Road for repair, and the result was very satisfactory. Also, an American sailor named AEOX, who passed through Little Luzon, had his Eagle King six-tube machine damaged for no reason. The local technicians repeatedly checked it but did not know where the problem was, so they could not repair it. As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, he sent it to the Great Shanghai Wireless Radio Company for repair, and he also left satisfied. The above two points have written certificates from the owners. Although the matter is small, it can also be seen that the company's technicians are excellent, and it is also a slight relief for our Chinese people.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Records of the Fragrant Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because Chinese people have many legends that tell stories of deities, and in these stories, the transportation vehicles ridden by the deities are often "cranes." Thus, the crane has also become a type of celestial creature. Moreover, because the crane's lifespan is relatively long, it is specifically invited to hold the position of "treasure" in the "Eight Treasures," serving as a symbol of "eternal youth." When it is embroidered on the yellow satin that drapes inside the imperial carriage, its body is pure white, and its head is vermilion red; this rich and vibrant color scheme is truly beautiful beyond description!</p>
<p>(Lingzhi) It's really impossible to explain what this Lingzhi actually is. Perhaps this thing doesn't even exist in the world! What I can explain is only "a type of fungus." Its meaning is the expression of auspiciousness and authority. At that time, the Empress Dowager was still acting as regent, and she was equivalent to the emperor, with the entire China shrouded under her authority. Therefore, it wouldn't be wrong to say that this Lingzhi represents her authority. Their color is deep green, resembling old holly leaves.</p>
<p>(Seven) The Qing (磬) is also a type of ancient Chinese musical instrument. It is a triangular shape with a missing side, resembling the character "人" (person). It is struck with a very thin wooden stick, with something resembling an abacus bead attached to the end of the stick. However, the person striking it must not use excessive force, and must strike it gently to produce a clear, high-pitched, and gentle sound; when mixed with many instruments, it sounds very beautiful! As for why it is listed as one of the "Eight Treasures," that cannot be investigated. Its color when embroidered on yellow satin is white jade, and it can be considered the simplest of the "Eight Treasures." (43)</p>
<h3>Handkerchief Revolution</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>The purpose of a handkerchief is to wipe away tears and mucus, and it can also be used as an accessory on a person's body. This is generally accepted. The most obvious example is the three handkerchiefs on a person wearing a suit. The one in the trouser pocket is for wiping hands and face. The one in the back trouser pocket is for containing phlegm and mucus. As for the one in the chest pocket, that is purely for decorative purposes.</p>
<p>As for the handkerchiefs in women's hands, it can almost be said that nine out of ten are used as accessories. Because women apply powder to their hands and faces, they naturally cannot allow sweat to seep through. All the practical uses are just wiping away clear and clean tears.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that the form of the handkerchief should not be invariably a square composed entirely of straight lines, but should cater to the trend, with each person devising their own unique designs, cut into circular, semi-circular, oval, triangular, hexagonal, floral, leaf-shaped, or other various shapes. Because in this day and age, the purpose of the handkerchief is more focused on decoration. Decorative items should naturally tend towards novelty. Only novelty can conform to the times.</p>
<p>If the artists who study new fashions are truly willing to promote a handkerchief revolution, I think that not only would there be a major change in form, but from an economic perspective, it would also be very reasonable, because if the shape of the handkerchief is not limited to a square with equal sides, then whether it is narrow and long, triangular, or scraps of irregular material, they are all good handkerchief materials.</p>
<p>As for new-style handkerchiefs, their practical functions of wiping sweat and holding phlegm are not affected.</p>
<h3>The Street Performer</h3>
<p>— Ma Ying</p>
<p>The streets of the village are truly quiet! The shop assistants are dozing off in the shops. The few pedestrians on the street are also silent. A large black dog is sleeping under the eaves of a house, as if having some strange dream, its raised ears suddenly twitching twice.</p>
<p>In the open space in front, it seems something has happened, with many people gathered around, shouting. Not good! Surely someone has been attacked by bandits again! I exclaimed in my heart. The villages have been unsafe lately, with assassination cases occurring frequently; however, no culprit has ever been caught. It is said that it is all the work of the bandits in the nearby mountains, so no one dares to catch them.</p>
<p>When I got closer, I realized I was wrong; it turned out to be a group of itinerant performers. They were surrounded by white cloth, with a cloth door, and two men wearing felt hats and short jackets standing at the door, their faces full of smiles, shouting unintelligibly. Many people were crowded outside the cloth walls, adults reaching into their pockets for copper coins, and children鑽ing between the adults' legs.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of gongs and drums rang out inside, and the two men wearing felt hats and short jackets lifted the cloth door, shouting, "Watch! Take a look!" Many people rushed to the door like madmen. Inside, a girl in red riding a fiery horse flashed past the door like an arrow. Immediately, the cloth door closed again, and the two men shouted, "Ten copper coins for a guest." That girl was really beautiful, her red clothes as red as peach blossoms. I took out ten copper coins and walked in through the cloth door.</p>
<p>Running around, just circling, one horse, one girl.</p>
<p>At first, I wanted to wait a while for a new act to come out, but I stood for an hour, and it was still that one horse, one girl, just circling.</p>
<p>Let's go back! Standing here all the time is also boring, better to go home and bite on dried radish, salty and flavorful! I turned around and followed a few people out of the cloth enclosure. The people outside were laughing at us.</p>
<h3>Playing With</h3>
<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>Some say that the dancing girls in the dance halls, who wear thin clothes, exposing their powdery arms and bosoms, displaying their beauty to the fullest, are provided for men's appreciation and amusement. Indeed, when she is embraced by a man, trembling on the smooth floor to the rhythm of the music, undoubtedly, she is a living toy. In this light, dancing girls are played with by men.</p>
<p>However, thinking about it the other way around, many young people are seduced by their beauty and flesh, becoming infatuated and muddled, neglecting their work and abandoning their careers, using the money earned through sweat and blood to buy that fleeting smile. When your money is exhausted and you are deeply in debt, her alluring beauty and flesh are given to another man, driving you to distraction, and leaving you dejected all day long. Your life can never escape her control. As a result, some become depraved, and some commit suicide. In this light, many young people are constantly being played with by them.</p>
<p>Ah! In this chaotic society, in the mysterious dance halls, who is playing with whom? In the end, is it men playing with women, or women playing with men? Writing to this point, I really find it difficult to judge.</p>
<p>I heard that the Meihua Opera Troupe's new creation, "Playing With," provides a delicate depiction and sharp judgment on this topic. It is indeed a great achievement since the beginning of Chinese opera, and it can be called a successful work in terms of consciousness and technique. Readers and friends who are interested in this topic, please pay attention to the premiere of "Playing With."</p>
<p>Local Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Temple of Lord Chunshen</h3>
<p>— Shanghai General News Agency</p>
<p>"The Pu is named after a surname, I will not be a fish reliant forever."</p>
<p>In the Warring States period, Shanghai was originally the fief of Huang Xie, the Chu Prime Minister Lord Chunshen. The Huangpu River is said to have been dug by Huang Xie. Because at that time, the Songjiang River was being harnessed to guide it into the sea, this waterway was excavated. Later, it was named Huangpu River after Huang Xie's surname, also known as Huangxiepu, Chunshenpu, or Chunshen River. Thus, Shanghai has the alternative name of Chunshen River, or simply Shen River.</p>
<p>With a basin reaching 250 li, the Huangpu River, which meanders into the sea, has made enormous contributions to the people of Shanghai in terms of farmland, water conservancy, transportation, and commerce. The people of Shanghai are naturally very grateful to Lord Chunshen and wanted to build a temple to pay tribute to him. Moreover, during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, when there was an alarm in Puxi (west of the Huangpu River), the people fled to Pudong (east of the Huangpu River). When Pudong fell, the people fled to Puxi again. Thanks to the barrier of the river, many lives were saved. Therefore, later generations praised "one river is better than 100,000 soldiers." In praise of his merits and virtues, they not only offered sacrifices, but even expressed it in song. However, the Lord Chunshen Temple, where sacrifices were offered in spring and autumn, has become a bit blurred for the average old Shanghainese due to repeated changes. Those who study the Shanghai concessions, seeing that the first clause of the Shanghai Foreign Concession Regulations north of the Shanghai Yangjingbang River mentions Lord Chunshen Temple under the articles not subject to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council, would raise questions and ask: Where exactly is the Lord Chunshen Temple?</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the Lord Chunshen Temple, which I think will not be without benefit.</p>
<p>The Lord Chunshen Temple was originally the Sanmao Pavilion. Wang Tao's Ying Ruan Zazhi, Volume 2, says: "The Sanmao Pavilion is outside the North Gate, and to its side is the Shrine of Lord Chunshen, which is the Yanzhen Temple mentioned in the local chronicles. The locals call it the Changren Si. The god of the Si cannot be verified, but it is popularly believed to be Lord Chunshen, and sacrifices are offered with reverence in spring and autumn..." It can be seen that the Yanzhen Temple next to the Sanmao Pavilion is the Lord Chunshen Temple. The Sanmao Pavilion was built in 1408 (the sixth year of the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty). The land was donated by the Tang family and dedicated to the Three Mao True Sovereigns, hence the name. In 1802 (the seventh year of the Jiaqing reign), Pan Qiren rebuilt the Dou Pavilion on its eastern side and renamed it Yanzhen Temple. Cao Hongzhi erected a stele and wrote a record for it. Later, in 1853 (the third year of the Xianfeng reign), it was destroyed in war. The temple site was then rented by Westerners, so the locals moved it to Chuanxin Street in the city, dedicated solely to Lord Chunshen, and the Three Mao True Sovereigns were abolished.</p>
<p>Now, when we take the No. 9 bus from Jing'an Temple Road, passing Yangjingbang River to the intersection of Henan Road, the ticket seller on the bus will shout: "Sanmao Pavilion Bridge is here! Sanmao Pavilion Bridge is here!" This shout from the ticket seller reminds you that this area near Henan Road is where the Lord Chunshen Temple of Sanmao Pavilion is located. As for the exact temple site, although it is difficult to find any traces, according to Ge Yuanxu's Hu You Zaji, "The Shrine of Lord Chunshen is on the northwest bank of the Sanmao Pavilion Bridge outside the North Gate." It can be seen that the temple site must be on the north bank of the Yangjingbang River, and northwest of the Sanmao Pavilion Bridge. Also, according to the same book, in the early years of the Tongzhi reign, there was still a "Chunshen Ancient Site" archway on the bank of the Yangjingbang River. By the early years of the Guangxu reign, even the archway had disappeared. In light of this, the site of the Lord Chunshen Temple must be in the area along the north side of Aiduya Road (now Yan'an East Road), east of the current Shandong Road and west of Henan Road, and closer to the Henan Road side, because the Shanghai County Chronicle clearly records that the Sanmao Pavilion Bridge is in front of the Sanmao Palace. Since the Lord Chunshen Temple is east of the Sanmao Pavilion, and the bridge is in front of the pavilion, it can be seen that the temple site would not be very large, or it may even have faced the current Henan Road.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Gan said this, she didn't continue the discussion. Hou Zhidao understood that the conversation couldn't proceed in that direction. He picked up his chopsticks to eat, without saying a word. Mrs. Gan smiled and said, "Second Brother, don't think I, as your sister-in-law, like to bring up old matters. I told you before that our neighbor Fang Lin is not your match. I can find you someone better. But you thought I was meddling and didn't take it seriously. Now that you understand things clearly, I can bring it up again. Ji Zhi interrupted and said with a smile, "Okay, Sister-in-law, why are you still mentioning this matter?" Mrs. Gan said with a smile, "Don't worry, what I'm saying is not about the past. It's embarrassing to bring it up, so what would I say? What I want to say now is that I should fulfill the wish I made, and your brother here can vouch for me." Hou Zhidao, when you speak, you never do it directly, always going on and on. How am I supposed to understand? And there's no need for any vouching." Mrs. Gan glanced at Hou Zhidao and said with a smile, "This is none of your business, why are you getting so anxious? Didn't I say that if the Second Brother's marriage can't be arranged, I can be his matchmaker? Now is the time." Then, she looked up at Ji Zhi and said, "The person I'm talking about also comes from a poor family, but she has some status. She is indeed a Miss. I think this kind of person best suits your conditions, because since her family circumstances are a bit difficult, her family education may not be so good. If you want someone with good habits and who knows how to endure hardship, you need someone like this. Moreover, she is still a middle school student, which is ten times better than the person you chose before." Ji Zhi said with a smile, "Sister-in-law, you really leave me speechless when you speak, bringing up such a long list." Mrs. Gan said, "Of course I have to say this much, or how would you understand? Now I ask you, have you given up on that other woman? If you have, then my job as matchmaker will be successful." (393)</p>

<h3>Talking about Chang'an</h3>
<p>— Zhuyi</p>
<p>Chang'an, what a poetic name!</p>
<p>She once had her bright and splendid era. Many emperors acted out various heroic stories there, and many poets were intoxicated in her embrace. Even Japan, which now dominates East Asia, once sent people to absorb the fragrance she exuded. At that time, Chang'an truly shook China! However, she is now forgotten, like a young woman who has lost her youth, no longer arousing people's nostalgia. However, I am from Chang'an, and I always love Chang'an. I know her loveliness and her greatness.</p>
<p>When you first visit Chang'an, the first thing you feel is the neatness and solidity of the city walls of Chang'an. The city walls are about forty li long, three zhang six chi high, and three zhang six chi wide. When you stand at the foot of the city wall, looking up, you can't help but marvel at its greatness! In the northwest corner of the city, there is also a small city, which is only a quarter of the size of the entire city. During the Qing Dynasty, that area was where the Manchus gathered. When the Eight-Nation Alliance captured Beijing, Empress Dowager Cixi fled to Chang'an and used this small city as a temporary refuge, hence the name "Imperial City." After the Xinhai Revolution, the Manchus gradually disappeared, and the Han people did not often go in. The inside became overgrown with weeds and accumulated with broken tiles. An occasional visit would evoke endless feelings. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, that place suddenly became prominent. Often, countless people held large gatherings there, clamoring with vibrant vitality. The city walls were dyed red and renamed "Red City." Seventeen years later, the red color on the city walls was scrubbed clean, and it was renamed "New City." After that, troops were often stationed in the small city, or military institutions were established. Soldiers guarded the four gates, and the inside was shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere. The common people could never enter, and many people lamented that they had not yet seen the magical "Empress Dowager Stone"!</p>
<p>The streets in Chang'an City were once paved entirely with stone slabs, quiet and solemn. However, in recent years, the stone slab roads are no longer visible, replaced by wide sandy roads. When the wind blows, sand and dust fill the air, detracting from Chang'an's beauty!</p>
<p>In the eastern corner of the city is the Confucius Temple, a large and magnificent temple with over a hundred ancient cypresses that are green in all seasons. Under the clear sky, the golden glazed tiles reflect brilliant light, as if countless small stars are shining there. The Confucius Temple is closely connected to the "Stele Forest," which has hundreds of types of stone tablets, arranged in rows. Famous steles from the Wei, Han, and Tang dynasties are preserved in this place.</p>
<p>The scenery outside the city is best in the area south of the city. Although there are scenic spots such as "Ba Willow Snow in the Wind," "Evening Glow over Mount Li" in the east of the city, "Grassland Mist" in the north of the city, and "Xianyang Ancient Ferry," "A Fang and Weiyang Palace Ruins" in the west of the city; however, they are not as beautiful as the scenery south of the city. In addition to the scenic spots of "Qujiang Spring Water" and "Wild Goose Pagoda Morning Bell" south of the city, the best scenery is still in the Zhongnan Mountains area (the Zhongnan Mountains are only about forty li from the city). Because of the Zhongnan Mountains, the scenery along the mountains is particularly beautiful. During the spring and summer seasons, the trees are lush everywhere. In the depths of the trees, you can vaguely see villages one after another, with countless clear streams passing through the villages, winding and flowing out of the villages, making a gurgling sound, like music. In March, when the peach blossoms in the Fanchuan area are in full bloom, they look like a brilliant colorful glow from afar. At the southern end of Fanchuan, there is a small town called Duquzhen, which produces a famous wine called Duqu wine. This is the wine that Li Bai loved to drink. The poets Du Fu and Du Mu often wandered here with cups in hand. Next to the Niutou Temple, there is the Du Zi Temple, which was built to commemorate Du Mu. Further south, the terrain gradually rises, and the scenery becomes more secluded and beautiful. Arriving here, one's worldly thoughts will truly disappear, and one will be free from all impurities. If you follow the winding Taiyi River and walk into Taiyi Valley, and climb the South Wutai Mountain from Taiyi Valley, that will be even more satisfying! The so-called Five Platforms are five mountain peaks, each with a temple on top. The reason why it is called South Wutai is to distinguish it from the Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province. Although there is no such dangerousness as Mount Hua, it is high enough. Standing on the Qingliang Platform and looking north, you can see Chang'an City, like a small straw mat, quietly laid on the ground. The Wei River is like a white ribbon, winding around its north side and flowing into the vast Yellow River...</p>
<p>Writing to this point, my heart has flown back to my lovely hometown!</p>
<h3>A Supplement to the Essay "......" "□□□□"</h3>
<p>— Manshu</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Xu published an essay with this title in "Ren Jian Shi" (The World). I have no deep knowledge of this subject, but "a fool's thousand thoughts may yield one success," so I would like to add a little. Of course, it's much more superficial.</p>
<p>"......" is a foreign product, only imported after the May Fourth Movement. When Mr. Lin Qinnan translated novels before, he inserted the annotation "This phrase is incomplete," which was the translation of this thing. In foreign books, six dots are commonly used, but stingy people only use three dots. However, China is "vast in territory and rich in resources." During assimilation, it gradually grows longer, nine dots, twelve dots, up to dozens of dots. One type of great writer simply dots three or four lines to show the profound meaning within, which is endless and indescribable. Readers also generally think this way. If anyone dares to say they don't feel the profound meaning within, they must be mentally deficient.</p>
<p>However, in the end, it seems to be like "The Emperor's New Clothes" in Andersen's fairy tale, which is actually nothing. But only a child would truthfully say it out loud. Children don't understand the "creations" of writers, so no one in China dares to expose it. But the weather is getting cold, and you can't walk naked on the road all year round. Eventually, you have to hide in the palace, and the wonderful sentences with several lines of dots are rarely seen lately.</p>
<p>"□□" is a domestic product. This thing appears in "The Biography of Emperor Mu". The teacher taught me that it is a missing text. This missing text also caused trouble. Someone said that the three □ characters in "□ life is dirty, □ kills □" are also missing text, and was scolded for it. However, it was only seen in the writings of the ancients before, and there was no way to supplement it. Now, it is seen in the writings of modern people, and it cannot be supplemented even if you want to. At present, there is a growing trend to replace it with "XX". This is imported from Japan. There are many of these things, so we can foresee the intensity of the content of this work. But, in fact, sometimes it is not like that at all. Randomly Xing (XX) a few lines, print it out, and it can indeed make readers admire the writer's intensity and hate the censor's severity. But when submitting it for censorship, it can also make the censor love his obedience, afraid to say many things, and only Xing it so vigorously. Killing two birds with one stone is more ingenious than dotting a few lines. China is currently anti-Japanese, so this clever plan may not be imitated. Nowadays, everything has to be bought with money, so naturally everything can be sold for money. But being able to sell money even for "nothing" is a bit unexpected. However, after knowing this, it becomes clear that making rumors for a living is still considered "genuine and honest, old and young do not deceive" way of life.</p>
<h3>After Being Expelled</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>—Father and Son Life Sketch—</p>
<p>The father stared at his son with some depression, faintly containing annoyance; the son sat silently opposite his father, occasionally playing with his fingernails. Silence occupied the room, only the father's weak, panting breath could be faintly heard. After a short while, the father suddenly asked with trembling lips:</p>
<p>"How did the school expel you?"</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you already? Why keep asking?" the son answered, irritated.</p>
<p>"I have to ask clearly. I don't believe it: being expelled just because of illness."</p>
<p>"Alright! Who would lie to you? The school's rules don't take into account reason or empathy. If you're absent from class for too long, of course you'll be expelled. Who asks why you were absent?" the son said angrily.</p>
<p>The father shook his head and sighed deeply. After a pause, he stood up with a trembling body, lowered his head slightly, and paced back and forth in the room. The son's eyes followed the father's back.</p>
<p>After a while, the son felt a little bored, so he picked up his teacup. With his lips against the rim, he slowly sipped the plain water. Suddenly, he put down the teacup, turned his head, and asked his father:</p>
<p>"Dad! How much money did you bring this time?"</p>
<p>"Why are you asking that?" the father asked, staring at his son in astonishment.</p>
<p>"I still owe someone a debt," the son said casually.</p>
<p>"I only brought fifty or sixty yuan this time," the father said softly.</p>
<p>"In that case, Dad, just give me forty yuan!"</p>
<p>"If I give it all to you, what will we use for travel expenses to go back?"</p>
<p>"Dad can always think of a way."</p>
<p>"Well, you can take thirty yuan then! I have to keep more than twenty yuan," he said. Then, with trembling hands, he pulled a bundle of banknotes from his inner pocket, counted out a stack for his son, and then very carefully put the rest back in his pocket.</p>
<p>The son took the banknotes and stood up happily.</p>
<p>"Dad! I'll be right back."</p>
<p>Saying that, he pulled open the door and walked out.</p>
<p>"Hey, are you coming back to the hotel for dinner?" the father asked, rushing to the door.</p>
<p>"Whatever."</p>
<p>After saying that, he hurried away without looking back.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>As the son walked down the street, he silently planned how to use the thirty yuan: the handball court? Or the dance hall? He hesitated between these two options. Walking along XX Road, he unconsciously saw Huifang Lane spread out before him. Then he remembered someone, as if her face was floating in his mind. This person was a woman who he believed was most devoted to him.</p>
<p>"Really, it's been a long time since I've seen Illy," he said to himself. He couldn't help but step into Huifang Lane. He stopped in front of a small vermilion door. He lightly tapped the knocker, and soon the door opened. A very lovely face poked out.</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Zhang! Long time no see!" the woman said, eagerly shaking his hand; looking at him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Really, it's been a long time!" he replied with a busy smile.</p>
<p>"Why haven't you come to visit me in so long?"</p>
<p>"I've been busy with schoolwork!"</p>
<p>"You're really diligent," the woman thought for a moment and then said with a smile:</p>
<p>"You came at just the right time. If you had come any later, I would have been gone. I'm worried about not having someone to go shopping with. Would you like to accompany me?"</p>
<p>"Sure, sure," he said, looking at her and smiling.</p>
<p>After saying that, the woman innocently took his hand and walked out. Her mother stumbled out from behind, saying:</p>
<p>"You daughter! You didn't even invite Mr. Zhang to have a cup of tea before dragging him away."</p>
<p>"He doesn't want tea!"</p>
<p>The woman turned her head and replied, then looked at him with a smile again.</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>He walked arm-in-arm with the woman, talking as they went. The woman stopped in front of a store.</p>
<p>"What do you want to buy?"</p>
<p>"A fountain pen."</p>
<p>"Don't you have one?"</p>
<p>"That one is lost."</p>
<p>Saying that, they stepped inside. The shop assistant greeted them warmly and spread more than a dozen different fountain pens on the counter, letting the customers choose.</p>
<p>"This fountain pen is most suitable for ladies," the shop assistant said, holding the pink fountain pen in his hand and showing it off.</p>
<p>"What do you think?" he asked, looking at her.</p>
<p>"I don't know what the price is," she said softly.</p>
<p>"Twenty yuan, 10% off," the shop assistant said, rushing to answer.</p>
<p>She hesitated, looking at the pen without speaking.</p>
<p>"Do you like it or not?" he urged. Then she tiptoed up, leaned her lips close to his ear, and said softly:</p>
<p>"I like it, but I think the price is a bit too expensive! I didn't bring that much money."</p>
<p>He smiled after hearing that. He immediately took out banknotes and paid for her, then took the pen and clipped it onto her collar for her. Again, he gently put his arm around her and walked out of the store.</p>
<p>"Where shall we go to have fun?" the woman asked.</p>
<p>"Whatever you like!" he replied with a smile. "You always say: 'Whatever you like! Whatever you like!' Everyone says that, and it won't be fun," the woman said coquettishly.</p>
<p>"I was afraid that you wouldn't like what I suggested, so that's why I said that; in that case, then let's first go to the Carlton Theatre to watch dancing, and after that, we'll go to Guanshengyuan to have dinner. How about that?"</p>
<p>The woman immediately agreed, and they proceeded according to the plan.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>The father sat alone in the hotel, waiting for his son to return. Time passed second by second, but his son was still not back. At seven o'clock, the father was unbearably hungry, so he bought a bowl of soup noodles and ate it alone.</p>
<p>It wasn't until nine o'clock that the son dragged his tired steps into the room.</p>
<p>"Why are you back so late? Have you had dinner?" the father asked with concern.</p>
<p>"A friend kept me for dinner," the son replied casually. He walked to a chair and sat down.</p>
<p>"Have you paid off the debt?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The son didn't seem very eager to talk to him, and his tone was often listless. The father thought his son was tired, so he urged him to go to bed.</p>
<p>The father sat next to his son, smoking a cigarette and saying:</p>
<p>"I think we should go home tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Living here is really too expensive. A bowl of noodles costs fifteen cents. At home, it only costs fifteen copper coins."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>The son replied indifferently, then turned his body inward and fell asleep.</p>
<h3>Laughing Girl</h3>
<p>— Hou Ruhua</p>
<p>Gently stroking the dark bruise on my leg,</p>
<p>I dare not sigh loudly,</p>
<p>The smile on my lips has withered,</p>
<p>Still, I must cast glances at the passersby.</p>
<h3>Songs and Rain Sounds: A Symphony of Sounds</h3>
<h3>Corpse (5)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>"What are you going to do with your daddy?" At this time, Old Man Xu prepared to shove his face into the other party's fist, raising his hen-like voice.</p>
<p>"Mind your daddy's business!" The fist waved in the air, a crossed stance standing in front of his chest.</p>
<p>The Fifth Master, who was watching the excitement, no, preparing to ascend to the top spot, couldn't help but add fuel to the fire;</p>
<p>"What's wrong with Zhu Ergou? He doesn't listen to Old Man Xu?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, I'll beat him." Zhu Ergou rolled up his sleeves, "It's not like his daddy died, hmph! Call Zhu Ergou, I don't have this kind of easy job!"</p>
<p>Old Man Xu did not protect his face; being punched by a hero was not a big loss. He had more important thoughts in his heart than his face; the fame of Old Man Xu for thirty years, or together with Zhu Xiaoquan, would be sent to the gates of hell. He also knew that Grandpa Wang wanted to push him off the top spot with his fire, but could he only live in Wujia Town, could he still wobble to Fuxing Tea Garden in the future? His face could grit his teeth and endure a punch from a hero, but he could not endure the eyes of Wujia Town, which were more piercing than nails. Earthworms crawled out on Old Man Xu's forehead, beads of sweat trickling like the moisture on the stones in front of the Fuxing Tea Garden, stretching out his trembling hands, struggling for his last breath;</p>
<p>"You don't know the power of my Old Man Xu!"</p>
<p>His fingers did not leave the tip of his nose, the hero's fist punched up like dark clouds.</p>
<p>" 的 Old Man Xu!"</p>
<p>Old Man Xu could no longer smell the stench of the gutter, lying straight down like Zhou Yu returning to heaven.</p>
<p>Do you want to see A Gen? He "ah"ed, his feet finally slipping in the mud, comparing his height with Old Man Xu, the riot was in the Fuxing Tea Garden. (End)</p>

<h3>The Financial Industry's Outlook Remains Bleak</h3>
<p>The decline of various industries in Shanghai this year is an undeniable fact. The situation is particularly dire at present. In previous years, around this time in midsummer, commercial sales and transactions were booming. This year, due to the decline of cities and the bankruptcy of rural areas, it is becoming increasingly difficult. The financial industry, as a pioneer of all industries, experiences prosperity and decline together. Therefore, it is appropriate that the current market conditions and transactions are generally weak and unenthusiastic. Yesterday, the interbank lending rate was still 7%, both in the morning and afternoon. The discount rate was 2-3%. The transaction volume for discounted bills was over 4.2 million in the morning and over 200,000 for new transactions. In the afternoon, it was over 300,000. Transactions in the Small General Association were over 400,000. The redemption of foreign mortgages amounted to over 800,000, with new loans amounting to over 1.2 million. The banknote recovery was over 800,000, and the issuance was over 900,000. Customer inflow was 200,000, and outflow was 400,000. Bank settlements: Foreign banks' settlement of drafts was 2.56 million, settlement of various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous mortgages was 5.45 million, and warehouse withdrawals were 600,000. Chinese banks' settlement of drafts was 2.78 million, settlement of various goods, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous mortgages was 6.23 million, and warehouse withdrawals were 200,000. Japanese banks' settlement of drafts was 2.1 million, settlement of various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous mortgages was 4.9 million, and warehouse deposits were 300,000.

<p>Securities: Last Day of the Month's Term</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Pass Peacefully. Only the June Contract Will Be Traded Today.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although it was the last day for futures trading of this month, the market was extremely peaceful, unprecedented before past settlements. The exchange floor was not deserted. Although there were no confirmed rumors of adverse news, there were also no good facts to report. Although sentiment was soft, the bulls were not panicking. Therefore, both the floating bulls and bears of this month were able to smoothly swap contracts on the last day without being squeezed. There were two reasons for this: first, they had prepared early in view of the severity of past squeezes, and second, brokers privately negotiated with those with larger numbers to swap contracts, reducing competition and minimizing the squeeze. The trading yesterday, from morning to evening, was very stable. The trends of each trade varied slightly due to the different swaps of both bulls and bears. There were slight differences in market prices, with some being higher and others lower, but the differences were very small, mostly competing within one or two cents. Only the purchase of the reorganization contracts numbered 23 and 25 in the first trade was relatively active, showing some signs of a squeeze. The rest were stable. As a result of the market prices, most were slightly better by five cents to one or two cents, with the 1928 bonds and the regular 6 bonds increasing by four cents being the most. However, the demobilization and short-term gold bonds for this month, as well as the 1996 bonds, were still slightly down by one or two cents. Today, only the June futures contracts will be traded. There is no sign of a rising trend. The total transaction volume was 16,328,000 yuan. The details of the increases and decreases are listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Listless All Day</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports: Yesterday (the 24th) in the New York stock market, the morning's initial hour saw a firming trend, but thereafter, due to labor unrest threats, the market became listless and mediocre throughout the day. Speculators were mostly observing, awaiting the reactions of various countries to Roosevelt's silver plan and the outcome of monetary stabilization negotiations. The small exchange rose again due to strong oil stocks, as Roosevelt demanded control of the oil industry. High-grade bonds and US government bonds were firm, while speculative bonds were mixed and slightly lower. Wheat prices were uneven due to drought and rain news. Corn rose due to a squeeze. Furthermore, according to agent reports: (Securities) trading was quiet, the market was slightly higher, and speculators awaited news developments. (Wheat) The spring wheat drought situation has not been alleviated, with only sporadic light rain. Spot wheat and corn rose due to government relief purchases, and prices are expected to continue to rise. Weather reports indicate scattered rain in several locations. (Cotton) Under the current circumstances, taking this action is considered good, but there is no trend. Bullish operators are mostly seeded, and selling from the South is scarce, with firm underlying prices. Some speculate whether Roosevelt will use his full inflation power if the market falls again. (Rubber) The industry has slightly increased support, and the market shows a stable trend, with purchases small and not rushing. (Sugar) The market is firm and quiet. (Silver) Lacking new developments, the market is dull and lackluster. The total daily turnover was 500,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Continues to Show Good Momentum</h3>
<p>The yarn market showed weakness again, but as this is the last day of the month for yarn, the market trend is still stable. Due to arbitrage absorption by money houses, the surface is slightly tight, while spot yarn sales continue to be good, with buyers from inland and Guangdong being the most numerous. Sellers have no intention of resisting short positions. Based on the current spot situation, there is hope for improvement in the market.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn: Near Months Up, Far Months Down</h3>

The sales included 1,650 bales from Da Feng, 2,900 bales from Da Ji, 1,150 bales from Geng Feng, 800 bales from Tong He, 900 bales from Jin Chang, and 8 bales from Chun Ji.

<h3>Cotton's Rising Momentum Ebbs, End-of-Month Settlement at 45.1 Yuan, Up 3.6 Yuan from April</h3>
<p>Today is the last day for May-term marked cotton, which had been under the tightest squeeze. The market atmosphere was slightly tired in the afternoon because of large deliverables. Thus, although Japanese traders bought, the price could not rise. However, the market atmosphere is still tight. But prices are already high, and overseas cotton prices are lower, making it difficult to predict the future situation. The final settlement for May-term marked cotton was 45.1 yuan, up 3.6 yuan from April, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zheng Marked Cotton Falls Back 3 Jiao</h3>
<p>In the morning session of marked cotton, near-month positions were still firm, but eased slightly after the second and third lots of bidding. As a result, the current month rose 2 jiao to 5 fen, while distant months fell 1 jiao. In the afternoon, due to ample deliveries, each month fell 1.5 jiao to 3-4 jiao. The total daily turnover was 139,900 dan. The sales included 7,800 dan from Geng Feng, 2,000 dan from Ji Feng, 1,700 dan from Shen Ji, 3,700 dan from Yi Cheng, 4,600 dan from Da Feng, 2,000 dan from Hui Kang, 3,600 dan from Shen Chang, and 2,800 dan from Chang Feng. The purchases included 6,000 dan from Tong Ji, 3,000 dan from Da Fu, 2,500 dan from Ren Feng, 6,400 dan from Chang Feng, 5,300 dan from Chun Ji, 2,300 dan from Chang Yu, and 3,300 dan from Shen Ji.

<h3>Cotton Sales Slow Down and Become Quiet Due to High Prices</h3>
<p>Spot cotton sales are sluggish, turning quiet due to high prices. Sources include 350 bales of Yao cotton and 795 bales of Tong cotton. The selling prices of spot cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 41.75 East Cotton Company to receive 2,000 dan to be delivered to the packaging factory</p>

<p>Lingbao Cotton 54.50 Da Cheng Factory to receive 90 pieces again</p>
<h3>American Cotton Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, good weather, and fewer buyers. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 8 to 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 2-3 points, Egyptian cotton fell by 4 points, and Indian cotton was initially soft due to speculator selling and long liquidation, but later rebounded due to some short covering. As a result, Pingar fell 1 rupee 7.5 angles, Omla rose 2.5 angles, and Bilo Creek fell 1 rupee 7.5 angles. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 24th):</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea Sales to Europe Continue to Be Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenmei green tea from both Luzhuang and Tuzhuang roads had robust appetite from British and French firms. High-grade Chouxin goods from Tunxi were sold at a top price of 205 yuan, and ordinary goods were sold at 140 yuan. The market for goods from other roads such as Huian Tuzhuang was stable. As for Qimen black tea, high-quality goods on the current market are still firm, but mid-to-low grade goods have already seen prices reduced by over 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Cocoon Market and Jiangsu Silkworm Season: New Cocoons Arriving Slowly in Hangzhou and Shaoxing, Mulberry Leaves in Suzhou in High Demand</h3>
<p>Tangpu, including Tangpu Suoqian Wangtan in Shaoxing, are all improved silkworm areas this year. Many farmers are raising improved breeds, while in the Xiaojiang area, native breeds are occasionally raised. Therefore, the silkworm season shows both good and bad sides. New cocoons have entered the market, and the improved breeds are of the best quality. Cocoon firms such as Taisheng have opened for three or four days, but not many goods have arrived on the market. Moreover, early batches of cocoons are mostly native breeds, so firms are competing to collect high-quality cocoons, driving up cocoon prices. Improved cocoons have risen from 30 yuan to 35 yuan, while native cocoons are at 20 yuan to 25 yuan. Silkworm farmers do not have enough leaf capital and are mostly observing and not selling.</p>
<p>In Fuyang this year, many native silkworms were lost midway, so late silkworms are being raised to compensate. However, in the improved areas, improved breeds are being raised. Early batches of cocoons have all pupated. Cocoon firms such as Yuanmao and Yuanfeng opened yesterday and are competing to collect improved cocoons, but few goods have arrived on the market. Cocoon prices (improved breeds) initially opened at 28 yuan, then rose to 32-33 yuan. Native cocoons are at 22-23 yuan. Silkworm farmers are losing money and find it difficult to sell. The market is expected to rise in the future.</p>
<p>This year, farmers in various cities and villages in Suzhou are raising silkworms at a good pace. Due to the declining rural economy, some are hatching and raising their own native breeds. However, the seeds of native breeds are not healthy and cannot withstand adverse weather conditions. They have been damaged. Recently, the weather has been sunny and pleasant, and the temperature is suitable. Silkworms are developing smoothly. Early batches are in the late stages of the first sleep and need abundant leaves, while late batches are also entering sleep. The latest batches are in the third sleep and need leaves. Leaf consumption is gradually increasing, and mulberry leaves are in high demand. The price of clean leaves has risen sharply, from 7-8 jiao per dan to 2.5-6 yuan.</p>
<p>The area near Xucun is an improved silkworm area. This year, due to economic reasons, farmers are hatching and raising their own native breeds. Due to the bad weather and unhealthy seeds, most of the early native silkworms have turned yellow and died. Improved breeds are being raised to compensate, causing a large discrepancy between early and late silkworms. Early batches have enough leaves and are ready to spin cocoons, with some having been on the mountain for one or two days. Late batches are still in the late stages of the first sleep and need abundant leaves. The late silkworms raised to compensate are mostly in the third sleep and have just started to consume leaves. If the weather does not change, the silkworms are expected to have a good harvest.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Sales Are Active and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, Sichuan pickled mustard tubers have seen a boost in market momentum due to the promotion of vegetarian diets. Ordinary goods from Kehuo have opened at over 21.5 yuan, with a good trend. Various groups are making purchases, and sporadic transactions in the inland areas of this street are also considerable. Yesterday's street prices for top-grade goods sold at 22 yuan, and ordinary goods sold at 17.5 yuan to 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain: Reports of Abundant Harvests of New Wheat in Jiangbei, Futures Selling Surges… Sharp Drop of 4-5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw slight weakness in various months after opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations were only around 48 fen. Although the weather was very good, the selling by market participants was not yet large. Therefore, the May market was able to hold up. However, the market atmosphere weakened significantly when it opened in the afternoon. The very good weather was deeply ingrained in people's minds, and reports from various locations indicated unusually abundant harvests of new wheat. If there is no rain during the harvest season in various places in Jiangbei, it is expected to be over 100%. Therefore, selling surged, and the market fell sharply. As a result, July fell 5 fen, August and September fell 4 fen each, and October had no open before yesterday and was opened at just 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour: Northbound Sales Stagnate, Near and Distant Months Loosen in Tandem</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw continued weakness in various months after opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations saw Chicago at around a negligible 48 fen, Canada was unchanged, but the clear weather created a favorable image for the upcoming wheat harvest. Additionally, various groups selling towards the north were maintaining their positions due to poor sales. Therefore, the near and distant months loosened in tandem. When the market opened in the afternoon, the various months fell by nearly a cent more than in the morning. However, the market rebounded slightly later due to short covering. The factories have stopped selling for the past few days and will likely wait until there is more certainty about the new wheat before selling again. As a result, the current month continued to fall by 7.5 li, June fell by 1.25 fen, July fell by 1 fen, August fell by 7.5 li, September fell by 1 fen, and October fell by 7.5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Soybeans: Factories Continue to Buy</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market remained stable. Supplies continued to arrive, and sales continued to be maintained. Additionally, factories continued to buy, so market sentiment was stable. It is estimated that two cars of Nanhe beans opened at a price of 2.82 yuan and 8 jiao, bought by the factory. One car of Bengbu beans opened at a price of 2.74 yuan, also bought by the factory. Over 500 bags of Yingzhou beans opened at a price of 2.88 yuan and 7 jiao 7, divided between factory and brokerage groups. One car of Feihe beans was traded on this street at a price of 2.97 yuan. There was also one car of Zhengyangguan beans bought by the export Xinghua group at a price of 3.04 yuan, and 200 bags were bought on this street at a price of 3.02 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Firmly Holding, Few Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw little fluctuation in customs gold, leading to a stable trend. The association set prices at 20.7 yuan for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar, 20.8 yuan for goods in this warehouse, 6.77 yuan for transshipment customs warehouses, and 6.8 yuan for newly arrived goods. Dutch red sugar and Taikoo sugar had little fluctuation. The factory price for Jinxin No. 1 white crystal was 19.3 yuan, No. 2 was 19 yuan, No. 3 was 18.3 yuan, No. 4 was 17.9 yuan, Jinxin brand ice was 17.8 yuan, Sanyuan brand was 17.5 yuan, Shuangyuan brand was 25 yuan to 25.2 yuan, Chebing No. 1 was 23.7 yuan, No. 2 was 23.6 yuan. Among domestically produced sugar, the Guangdong group offered over 200 bags of Huizhou white at 17.4 yuan to 5 jiao. The Chaoqing group continues to hold its stock of Chaoqing, offering only dozens of bags of Jieqing at 11.9 yuan, later calling for 12 yuan. It also offered over 100 pieces of Haibei Pianqing at 9.5 yuan. The Jian group offered Gaozhuang ice at 17.8 yuan per brick.</p>

<h3>Death Ray</h3>
<p>— Gu She</p>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper, Germany has now built death ray bases 300 kilometers from the border, and the Second World War will be decided by death rays. This death ray has a range of up to 200 kilometers, and the death rays emitted can reach key locations everywhere, such as railways, highways, stations, and fortresses. Each time a death ray is emitted, its destructive power can reach thousands of square meters. It is said that a death ray bomb weighs 100 kilograms, of which 25 kilograms are explosives, gas, or flammable chemicals. When launched in Germany, it can directly reach the territory of France, 150 to 200 kilometers away. This is truly a terrifying record. The invention of the death ray was heard of several years ago, and now it is actually being applied. Moreover, the Second World War will soon be decided by it. Seeing the strength of its destructive power, we are truly worried about the future world and all mankind.</p>
<p>Scientific inventions were originally beneficial to mankind, but now they are being used for killing. I really don't know what benefits this scientific invention has for mankind. However, this is by no means the fault of scientific invention, but rather that mankind has misused this scientific invention. Scientific inventions have contributed greatly to mankind, but at the same time, they have also killed many people. Why is this? This is because there is a class of people who specialize in killing people, and unfortunately, these scientific inventions are all grasped in the hands of this group of people. Thus, the great tragedy of mankind slaughtering mankind is constantly happening one scene after another. Not only will great tragedies happen at any time, but also in peacetime, a cruel killing business is being carried out on a large scale silently and imperceptibly at all times. What a tragic world this is.</p>
<p>How many people in the world are now on the verge of starvation, cold, and death? How many exquisite machines in the world can make clothes, bread, cultivate grains, develop cultural undertakings, and promote the rapid upward movement of human knowledge? However, they are closing these machines, not producing, preferring to pour large quantities of butter and milk into the ocean, and using these exquisite machines to manufacture killing medicine bombs, fireworks, and death rays, turning things that feed people into things that kill people. What is the reason for this? I hope everyone thinks carefully.</p>
<p>Turning things that can feed people into things that kill people is, in any case, an unreasonable thing. The matter is very clear. People originally live to live, but now there is a group of people who insist on telling everyone to die. What is the reason for this? Of course, they can also say beautifully that it is right and just, humane, and for the motherland to die. But is it right and just? Is killing just and humane? And for whose motherland is everyone dying?</p>
<p>The matter is tragic and also interesting. Everyone, think about it carefully. What is the reason for this?</p>
<h3>A Child's Diary</h3>
<p>— Yingying</p>
<p>Several years ago, my father went bankrupt.</p>
<p>At that time, I was smaller than I am now, and I didn't understand anything. When everyone else was worried and suffering, I was still full of happiness! Playing all day long, without any worries.</p>
<p>Innocence filled my pure heart!</p>
<p>I remember one time, there was really no money to buy rice at home, so we used a bowl of noodles as a substitute for lunch.</p>
<p>So, I threw a tantrum at my father,</p>
<p>"Dad, why aren't we eating rice today? It's not good. Those noodles are really hard to eat, and there are no shrimp."</p>
<p>Dad didn't say anything and didn't answer me. He just slowly stroked my hair; at the same time, many drops of clear water seemed to flow onto the back of the hand holding my bowl, piercing into the flesh.</p>
<p>I was even more sulky. "I don't want to eat it!" I pushed the bowl of noodles away with a "bang."</p>
<p>Only then did I see that Dad was really crying. So sad!</p>
<p>I wanted to confess my guilt to Dad! My little heart was repenting.</p>
<p>My brother pulled me away to another room. "Huang, younger brother! You are too cruel! You have shattered the old man's heart even more. We are poor. How can we eat shrimp noodles!"</p>
<p>"Brother is lying to me. Didn't we always eat shrimp noodles before?"</p>
<p>I still pouted my little mouth.</p>
<p>"We weren't poor then! Maybe we will still have shrimp noodles to eat later; maybe we can eat even better things than shrimp noodles! Good brother, that's what we need to strive for."</p>
<p>Later, I slowly grew up! And understood everything?</p>
<p>Dad's age increased year by year, and he couldn't do anything anymore. Naturally, our lives became even more difficult.</p>
<p>Brother is really good! He told Dad that although he couldn't earn a lot of money to support the family, he was good at writing articles! At least, the income from his monthly manuscript fees could subsidize some of the family's miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p>This meant subsidizing us, not his own small family, because brother had not yet married a sister-in-law!</p>
<p>He often said that it doesn't matter if we are poor! As long as we don't rely on others and don't borrow money from people, it doesn't matter at all. We finally went bankrupt because we couldn't fight the environment! But it doesn't matter, within the possible range, we should still strive.</p>
<p>Now brother has a manuscript fee income of three or four yuan a month, plus his salary. It's enough for us to live on! Sometimes Dad also wants to find other things to do, but brother definitely won't allow it!</p>
<p>He said that it's fine if we can get through the hard times! If we can get better in the future and have more income, we will be just as happy.</p>
<p>I joked with my brother! In the future, when we have more money, you can give me shrimp to eat; those big shrimps. A kind smile appeared on Dad's wrinkled face!</p>

<h3>Two-Faced Personality</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>All humans possess a dual nature, which is perhaps the very reason for humanity's existence. This duality is most evident in officialdom. An official adopts one attitude towards his superiors: fear, servility, and flattery; and quite another towards his subordinates: arrogance, contempt, and impatience. Because towards his superiors, he is a subordinate; towards his subordinates, he is a superior. Thus, to superiors, he must observe the demeanor of a subordinate; to subordinates, he must maintain the authority of a superior. I've heard that in the past, people taking photographs would first take two pictures of themselves, each with different attire and demeanor, and then combine them into one. The two selves might appear as guest and host, or master and servant, and the image was called "A Portrait of Two Selves." But if one self sat arrogantly while the other knelt before him in a pitifully subservient manner, the picture would be called "Beseeching Oneself." Such a photograph perfectly embodies the dual nature of a person. It is a satirical painting that even the world's greatest caricaturists could not create with such lifelike accuracy.</p>
<p>A dual personality is like the two sides of a piece of paper, one side black, the other white. This is not unique to officials; all humans possess this trait. A master's attitude towards his servants is different from his attitude towards his own master; a creditor's attitude towards his debtors is different from his attitude towards his own creditors. They all adopt different attitudes to deal with them.</p>
<p>Why does a person have two different personalities? A certain ethicist once said that every master is also capable of becoming a slave. Because by acknowledging the possibility of being a master, one implicitly acknowledges the possibility of being a slave. Therefore, once power is lost, they wholeheartedly and submissively bow before their new master. In fact, why wait until power is lost to become wholeheartedly submissive? Even under the same circumstances, with the same status and authority, one can simultaneously act as someone else's master and someone else's slave. Humans are indeed remarkable.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in modern society, to navigate the environment, one must possess a dual personality. One must be capable of being both master and slave. In the position of master, one assumes the air of a master; in the position of slave, one adopts the demeanor of a slave. For no one can remain a master or a slave forever. Moreover, above the master, there is another master; below the slave, there is another slave. A dual personality is indeed a valuable asset. Yet, people often hurl the epithet "two-faced" as an insult. Is a dual personality really despicable and base? Should people strive to maintain a single personality? Even if a single personality is noble, it will surely encounter many difficulties when dealing with diverse environments. Therefore, I believe that using "two-faced" as an insult is nonsensical. However, a dual personality can also be quite distressing. For example, one must express one attitude towards a master and another towards a servant. Isn't that difficult? It's easier to manage in separate environments; but simultaneously dealing with a master and a servant in the same place and at the same time is overwhelming. If one is overly servile to the master, the servant will feel embarrassed; if one is overly arrogant towards the servant, the master will feel apprehensive. This is truly agonizing. Only those with exceptional skill can resolve this dilemma.</p>
<p>However, clever people can learn it easily!</p>
<h3>The Unhappy Biography (11)</h3>
<p>— Wang Wo</p>
<p>Divorce Alimony</p>
<h3>On the Afternoon Nap</h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>As summer approaches and the weather warms, one climbs onto the wooden bed at night, feet stretching out beyond the covers, yet still feels restless and uncomfortable, without a trace of coolness. It's not exactly scorching heat, but one tosses and turns, unable to fall asleep peacefully until well past midnight. I think everyone would agree that such a situation is tiresome. But I also believe that some people can sleep soundly, like lovers nestled in each other's arms, bodies touching, heads close. Even if it's sweltering, they can surely sleep peacefully and dream sweetly. Unless, of course, they are deliberately seeking amusement, complaining of boredom in the middle of the night, in which case it might feel as if there are needles on the bed, and they won't be able to sleep either. But that's another matter. Even though one can't sleep at night, and precisely because one can't sleep at night, one becomes lethargic during the day. One can barely manage to get through the morning, but after lunch, it becomes truly impossible to maintain any energy.</p>
<p>That's how it is for me. For the past ten days, an afternoon nap has become a scheduled part of my day. After lunch, all worldly thoughts subside, unlike the wild imaginings of the night before. I lie down on the bed, face up, and sleep most peacefully.</p>
<p>Based on experience, this kind of peaceful afternoon nap is an "unsurpassed happiness" in a life of suffering, especially for me personally. I can never sleep peacefully at night, not even during the "sleeping season" of winter. So many worries disturb me, and the day's anxieties continue into the night. The assault of nightmares is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>But I must state clearly that my appreciation for the afternoon nap has nothing to do with any desire to imitate the humorous gentlemen; it's simply the experience of a lazy commoner, which should be considered an exception.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, an afternoon nap is indeed more lively and meaningful than sleeping late. If Confucius and his disciples, in their "Analects," did not talk about humor but only about laziness, then I would bravely join their ranks.</p>
<p>I believe that in this world at the end of the century, people are extremely miserable, so miserable that they can't even sleep at night. Life is only a few short decades long, so if one doesn't seek some solace in an afternoon nap, what is life worth?</p>
<p>Although Zai Yu was scolded by Confucius for napping during the day, who called him "rotten wood that cannot be carved" and "a wall of filthy earth that cannot be plastered," today, thousands of years later, some people are vindicating him, saying that Confucius was wrong. Qian Ren You Hanming, who "never eats more than three bowls at each meal, and sleeps for most of the day," is surely scorned by many virtuous gentlemen as a useless person, but the "Analects" seemed to cite him as a comrade, and there is reason for that.</p>
<p>However, I also have some experience to share: afternoon naps are good, very beneficial, (but I must solemnly state that there is absolutely no humor in an afternoon nap) but one should not sleep for too long. Precisely ten minutes or so is best, and at most, no more than half an hour. If one sleeps for most of the day, like Youzi, it is actually harmful to one's health, and one should be particularly careful.</p>
<p>As the seasons change, when spring arrives, with its fragrant flowers and singing birds, everyone says it's great to stroll in the park, but I stubbornly stay indoors, unable to express any sense of welcome. Now that summer has arrived again, I continue to live like an inanimate animal, with only the afternoon nap as a way to vaguely express my respect for the seasons.</p>
<p>Comrades, the time has come! How much we need an afternoon nap! Sleep! Nap!</p>
<h3>Scientific Spirit Mediums</h3>
<p>— Cen Lou</p>
<p>The extent of Chinese people's seeking gods and worshiping Buddha is truly unparalleled. Marriage requires divination, travel requires divination, building a house requires divination, choosing a burial site requires divination, becoming an official requires seeking divine help, raising sons requires seeking divine help, becoming wealthy requires seeking divine help, and even national disasters require the construction of Daoist temples (it is said that Japan's prosperity is due to the numerous and properly constructed Daoist temples, so China has to follow suit). China can be said to be a country founded on Daoist temples, seeking gods, worshiping Buddha, and divination. Yet, the country is still not prosperous and continues to "shrink its borders by three thousand miles every day." I wonder what the reason for this is. And now, there is the invention of Scientific Spirit Mediums. Spirit mediums combined with science! This is truly remarkable, and undoubtedly more effective than Kalachakra initiations. We only need to look at how they are used: three people press down on a saucer, and the saucer moves and points to letters. What a miraculous and convenient way to seek divine guidance! From now on, people only need one of these contraptions to defeat Japan's dumdum bullets and five-hundred-pound aircraft bombs with ease.</p>
<p>Old men might lament, "When a nation is about to fall, there will surely be monstrous things." This Scientific Spirit Medium can be considered a monstrous thing of a nation on the verge of collapse. But this is not necessarily the case. Scientific Spirit Mediums have their own specific social causes. The social cause is the bankruptcy of the countryside, the bankruptcy of urban industries, and the severe destruction and trampling of the entire nation by imperialism. The general populace, looking ahead, sees only a vast and uncertain future with no way out. The economic crisis has particularly severely hit these people, leaving them with no choice but to use fantasy and empty dreams to comfort and numb themselves, and to seek an unattainable way out. This is the origin of the popularity of Scientific Spirit Mediums. The popularity of Scientific Spirit Mediums is inextricably linked to the disintegration of the social economic foundation. While the upper class has Kalachakra initiations, the general public—especially the petit bourgeoisie—has Scientific Spirit Mediums. This is a contrasting yet intrinsically linked phenomenon.</p>
<p>The nation's crisis and the destruction of society have reached an unprecedented level. Yet, Chinese people still seek a way out through the old methods of seeking gods and worshiping Buddha. I truly feel heartbroken for everyone. I truly don't believe that there is no way out for everyone. In fact, there is a path, it is easy to walk, and it is accessible, but they are unwilling or unable to take it. This can only determine their tragic, declining fate. In that case, we have nothing to pity about these people. A certain social essence determines their certain destination. In fact, what is there to pity? History arranges the final fate of everyone.</p>
<p>Go then, you pitiful people. Scientific Spirit Mediums comfort you and will ultimately bury you. History is unforgiving; it sweeps away those who decline. At this time, you have no room for hesitation or indecision.</p>
<h3>It is Better to Endure</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Games in the Philippines have been open for nearly a week. Those who care about our country's success or failure have been paying attention to the Manila telegrams in the newspapers every day. Thankfully, the results revealed at today's closing ceremony are: our country won a football championship, and a volleyball and basketball runner-up, and in the overall tally, our country ranked third, which has not completely disappointed the people!</p>
<p>I remember that the results of the women's volleyball and basketball games were lost due to the injustice of the referees. Furthermore, it was said that our female athletes violated the articles of association. Later, the female athletes cried incessantly, because this was an injustice! At that time, a funny male athlete said to them: "Why are you crying, this is sports! What's so rare about losing? Anyway, our country has not lost anything! We can't blame their unfairness. Originally, we Chinese should suffer some losses everywhere. Such a large territory is still being given to others with both hands. Is it worth crying for only the trophy? I ask you to save these precious tears, and wait until the future XXX and then flow!" This evening's words are really painful and heart-stabbing. No wonder after saying it, a certain gentleman also burst into tears unconsciously.</p>
<p>Although, regarding this matter, our country's representatives once protested, and negotiated with the Philippine authorities, demanding a rematch. But in the end, our side withdrew this protest automatically because we won the victory of public opinion (?).</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>However, I think that in fact, even if a protest was issued, it may not have any effect; now that this happens, it is still considered that our country know it's place.</p>
<p>Finally, the Japanese representatives suddenly and inexplicably put forward an unreasonable condition of requesting to amend the articles of association. The Philippines also unreasonably accepted it; without the consent of our side, they arbitrarily modified Article 10 of the articles of association, allowing non-member countries to participate. Now that the conference has announced its closure, under this unequal treatment, our country's representatives can only withdraw silently; and at the same time, they declared "illegal resolutions, we swear not to recognize them." A huge wave of the Far Eastern Games began here, but I don't know what the future results will be? It remains to be seen later. But we Chinese are oppressed and despised everywhere, which is really painful to say! Might is right, weak countries have no diplomacy, what is there to talk about in the real world? As long as they are strong and domineering, then everything can take advantage of it. Only fools will believe in justice! This time the Far Eastern Games dispute is really a small matter. It does not involve major national policies, nor does it involve diplomatic matters. Why be so alarmed? It's worth leaving the meeting. I still think it's better to be patient. Anyway, we are a nation of great tolerance and will never blame you.</p>
<h3>Buddhists Participating in a Nation-Humiliating Conference</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>It was recently reported that the local news said: "This year in late July, the Japanese Buddhist Youth Association will hold the Second Pacific Buddhist Youth Association Conference in Tokyo. The countries that it invites openly list the puppet state of Manchuria as second, and China as third. Moreover, its preparatory staff jointly includes the Chinese Team Leader Fujii Kusao and the Manchurian Team Leader Kobayashi Keizen, insulting our country in every possible way. All of our countrymen should be angry and cut off relations with it. However, the Sino-Foreign Daily, published in Kyoto, Japan, on the 8th of this month, reported that the Chinese Team Leader Fujii reported that more than ten Buddhists in our country were induced to claim to be representatives and decided to attend the conference."</p>
<p>Our country's Buddhist community has always lacked unity, resulting in a few scum occupying the position of representatives and acting recklessly, which has become commonplace. However, this time Japan is holding a meeting, on the one hand, it includes the puppet state as a puppet, and on the other hand, it induces our country's monks and laity to attend. It must establish relations between our country and the puppets, and its sinister intentions are unspeakable! But Chang Xing is ignorant of the overall situation and recklessly participates, wanting to associate with the representatives of the puppet state that the world does not recognize, humiliating himself and the country. Nothing is more extreme than this; I hope that our countrymen will unanimously find a way to stop it, which is the good fortune of the country's future.</p>
<p>Japan's aggression against our country often uses different diplomatic methods to carry it out; forced use, without exception. The previous organization of the International Industrial Tourism Group in Shanghai, and the recent initiation of a tourism group to Japan in Beiping, etc., are nothing more than one of its conspiratorial means. Unfortunately, our countrymen are greedy and forget righteousness, and are willing to sell their conscience and personality; it is extremely painful to say! At present, the hatred between China and Japan is deepening, and the emotions are also becoming more broken; but those muddleheaded Buddhists are still willing to be listed side by side with the puppet Manchuria. From the Japanese perspective, this is really what is called "not afraid of the fish not taking the bait."</p>
<h3>Woodbine</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>I like woodbine flowers.</p>
<p>Although woodbine does not have the鲜艳鲜艳 of roses, it has the fragrance of roses; although it does not have the Qingqi of plum blossoms, it has the purity of plum blossoms. I like woodbine.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, my family lived in Suzhou. We rented a private garden at a very low price. There were winding paths, strange rockeries, clear streams, and more fragrant flowers. Woodbine flowers are the most exciting one for me. On a kind of wooden bridge there is a bamboo shed, and there is a woodbine growing on it. In late spring, a little bit of white flower buds will turn that bamboo shed into a big flower basket, bees and butterflies always wander there, and I often immerse myself in that lovely fragrance. I would lean on the tree railing and stand there for an hour or two, and sometimes I would be hypnotized by the fragrance of the flowers and the buzzing of the bees, and just sleep on the bridge; every time I was always carried to bed by my mother.</p>
<p>At that time, I was lonely, I had no companions. Only I went to appreciate that lovely woodbine, and no one else accompanied me to lean on the bridge railing, and at the same time hypnotized by bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It passed like that for two years. When the woodbine bloomed for the third time, I finally had two child companions: one was Yun, who was the same age as me, and the other was Yun's sister Ying, who was three years younger than me. They were my fellow villagers, and they had just come to the city from the countryside and were living in my home. We played all kinds of games on the bridge and under the flowers every day. I no longer leaned on the bridge railing alone, and I was no longer hypnotized by bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Speaking of woodbine, I will remember the small scar on my forehead. Once, Ying asked me to pick the woodbine on the shed. I couldn't pick it. Yun was shorter than me. But I couldn't bear to disappoint Ying, so I called Yun to help me onto the bridge railing. When one of my hands just touched a bunch of lovely woodbine, my foot slipped and I fell from the bridge, which was more than half a zhang high, into the pool, and my head hit the bridge pillar and bled. As a result, I was rescued. I was still holding a woodbine in my hand. Very strange. Since then, I have had a better impression of woodbine.</p>
<p>This is not a romantic comedy. At that time, I was not old enough to fall in love, but I would be happy when I thought of this. Maybe it's because the childhood memories are worth recalling? Maybe it's because the pure and fragrant woodbine is worth missing!</p>
<p>I always love woodbine flowers.</p>

<h3>Like Ants on a Hot Pot</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Because of the economic difficulties in my family, I have no power to study, so I have to go to the store to work as an apprentice in the store to serve, but I am still favored by the shopkeeper. But I do some meaningless things all day long, and I have no increase in knowledge. Looking forward to the future, I feel terrified. In today's civilized world, how can you stand in society without considerable knowledge? Because I always want to study on the one hand and serve on the other. I once told my father about this idea, and planned to go to commercial school to make up for it. My father was very happy that this kind of school did not cost much, and he was very supportive of my good learning heart. He immediately discussed it with the owner and asked for two hours of leave every day, but the owner not only did not allow it, but criticized it greatly, saying: "Since you want to study, why come out to learn business!" We apprentices are like child brides, how dare we not follow, so we had to give up. But my heart for learning is like looking at the clouds in a severe drought, so I have been like ants in a hot pot recently and don't know what to do. If you say that you go to practice on your own, the books will not speak, and who will I ask if I don't understand? If you say you abandon business and go to school, you will be oppressed by economics and have no job, and eating becomes a problem. If you say you continue to follow this inertia, the mental pain is really unbearable, and it is difficult to advance or retreat, and I am really painful. I have always admired</p>
<p>Editor is the guide for young people who are wandering in the wrong way, so I ventured to ask you to give me an appropriate method, and I long for you to give me a reply as soon as possible. I wish you</p>
<p>Health Zhu Qingyuan bowed</p>
<p>Answer: I was very touched when I received your letter. People who have the opportunity to study don't study, and people who don't have the opportunity to study want to study. You think that studying is hopeless because you can't go to school, but I don't think so. A few days ago, when I answered the question of Mr. Shao Da, I said that one does not necessarily have to go to school to study. Now I will give another example, and you can probably believe it. Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, probably knows this person. He did not</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>I have never been to any school. When I first entered the Commercial Press, I was an apprentice like you. He studied English without going to school, and relied entirely on self-study, but now he can give English speeches fluently, (this is what he said himself) so as long as there is perseverance, that person can't study by himself, and then there's no way to succeed. You may say, "These words are just good to hear, and do not take into account your difficulties. One book will not speak, and who will I ask if I don't understand?" That's right, beginners often do this, but you can't be discouraged because there are some places you don't understand. You can read it twice if you don't understand it once, and three times if you don't understand it twice. Eventually you will understand it, but it will take more time than people who study in school. Going further, the more you study through your own hard work, the more you will benefit and the deeper the impression. People who study in school often have a problem. If you don't understand something, you can ask the teacher, and you will be lazy and unwilling to solve the problem yourself. Therefore, you don't seek much understanding when you study, and the impression you get is also very superficial. After a few days, you still give it back to the teacher. This is the fact, and you must not think that it is empty talk.</p>
<p>Difficulty in understanding when reading is a secondary problem of self-study, and this difficulty can always be overcome. The most difficult thing for beginners is not knowing what to read, and even more so, not knowing which book to read. This kind of hesitation, without guidance, will surely make you take a lot of detours. For this reason, the circulating library of this newspaper now has "reading guidance", which specializes in helping out-of-school self-studyers solve problems. You can sign up to participate. They can guide you how to study on your own.</p>
<p>There is one more thing I want to tell you. It is good to read books, but the reason why we want to read books is to understand our own lives and understand the current environment. In short, we read books to obtain some knowledge and ability to cope with life. We don't want to be scholars, filled with a lot of principles and knowledge. So it doesn't matter if we don't read many books, and there is no need to be sad. In the experience of actual life, we can also achieve our purpose of reading books.</p>
<p>Friends, pluck up the courage to study on your own and work hard to overcome the difficulties of self-study. We should have the following purpose in life, dealing with people, and solving all problems: "Find a way to live besides death." If this method is absolutely unsuccessful, change another method. If this road doesn't work, take another road. If you rigidly solve the problem, you will feel that you are on a dead end and the future is dark. In short, we must first ask whether it is possible to do something in fact. If it is possible, we must do it no matter how difficult it is. If it is not possible, we will overturn it. This is the great principle of life. If you can follow this direction, I dare say that you will benefit endlessly in your life. What do you think?</p>

<h3>MADAM X (5)</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>The beautiful Madam brought a tray of tea with oranges to Min Sun's side,</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, quench your thirst. I think I'll go downstairs to take a look." She stood up, gliding with a foxtrot-like step to the dressing mirror, tilting her snake-like waist, raised her hand to tidy her electrocuted hair, the sleeves of her bathrobe straightened to her shoulders, and a dazzling, white wrist flashed in the mirror.</p>
<p>The gentleman straightened his back and naturally adjusted his tie. "Mrs. Yin, do you like to dance? I'd be happy to accompany you." He snapped his feet together and jumped off the sofa.</p>
<p>"Please wait a moment," she sent a charming, mesmerizing smile from the mirror. "I haven't changed yet!"</p>
<p>He smiled in a Sheffer-like manner to show his agreement. He smoked a cigarette, his left hand tucked in his pants pocket, his left foot subtly keeping time with the music, and a smoke ring he exhaled was dispersed by the spring breeze.</p>
<p>Half a head and one leg peeked out from the bedroom doorway, and seeing that the gentleman was not paying attention, she deliberately hid on the floor. Min Sun flicked the cigarette ash and turned around, and the Madam, like Hollywood's mysterious beauty Greta Garbo, threw her whole body in front of the gentleman.</p>
<p>A short top, revealing the shirt under her neck and chest, and a short skirt, all in black, "Let's go downstairs!" She extended an arm, and stepping with two fused hearts, they left number 356.</p>
<p>The clever servant was already waiting outside the door, "Madam is going out."</p>
<p>The Madam nodded, and the gentleman immediately resumed his polite manner and said:</p>
<p>"Is Junyang back?"</p>
<p>"Who knows when he'll be back? ... If someone comes, tell them we're downstairs!"</p>
<p>The waiter bowed and watched him enter the elevator.</p>
<p>Enchanting music, gentle air, engulfing two fused hearts. The whole floor was bustling, with couples embracing in the dim green light. The Madam's body, like a bowstring on a mandolin, touched Min Sun's shoulder from time to time, and a Boy familiar with the gentleman led them to a small table in the corner of the floor, as if waiting for them. The lights brightened throughout the floor after they were seated.</p>
<p>The gentleman politely extended his excellent fingers, tidying his Chaplin-like hair. It seemed as if all the eyes on the floor were needles stabbing at him. He smiled – naturally, with a Sheffer-like smile. The Madam arrogantly ignored the people around her. She sipped soda, lowered her head, and deliberately avoided the looks cast at her.</p>
<p>The music played through X times. Min Sun straightened his tie and stood up first. At the same time, the Madam gently placed her left palm on the gentleman's shoulder, pressed against his chest, nestled her face against his, and her lively steps felt like electricity running through Min Sun's entire body. He was intoxicated by the fragrance, like wild lilies, scattered near his hair.</p>
