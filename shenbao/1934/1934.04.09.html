<p>誠如我國當局所表示。歐美各國之不承認僞組織。早已成爲國際道德之鐵律。苟有背乎此鐵律者。將損及其國家人格。但月前一度宣傳之僞組織承認風説。迄今餘音嫋嫋。似斷若績。而德日勾結承認僞滿之説。尤聞有蛛絲馬跡可尋。是則不能不以極懇摰之態度。忠告我友邦德國之朝野者也。日本冒天下之大不韙。一手造成僞組織。環顧宇内。絶鮮同調。於是惱羞成怒。脱離國聯。以示决絶。而留恣意橫行之餘地。然脱離之後。又未嘗不以孤立爲懼。故又肆其鬼蜮伎倆。多方拉攏。德國因失望軍縮平等之要求。而宣告脱離國聯。日本認爲忠難同志。極意聯歡。固在意中。特爲德人計。不幸而步武僞滿後塵。降爲日人傀儡。則殊不値得耳。</p>
<p>德國痛心疾首於凡爾塞和約之束縳。卽恊約國之公正人士。亦表同情。迨其爲軍縮平等問題而脱離國聯。世界輿論仍不惜設身處地。曲予諒解。良以日德脱離國聯之動機。截然不同。一爲便於侵略。一爲貫澈自衛。世人之判斷。因亦隨之而異。且依今日之情勢。德國重返國際之關鍵。繫於軍縮。列强之軍縮談判。雖極盡鈎心鬥角迂迥曲折之奇觀。然在下届大戰爆發之一煞那前。總不敢棄之若遺。故戰禍一日不爆發。軍縮談判。將一日存在。而德國之重返國聯。亦時時有其實現可能性。此又與日本立塲絶對逈異者也。</p>
<p>或者曰。德日之或然的勾結。在於對俄。然俄德之間果有不得不衝突理由在乎。則又不能無疑。自國社黨執政後。德俄所標榜之主義。固如冰炭之不能相容。其所採取之外交政策。固亦有維持或不維持現狀之區别在。但兩國邦交。初未至勢不兩立之程度。則無否認之餘地。溯自希脱拉得勢以來。其假想敵大包圍之壁壘。倍形森嚴。蘇俄則與其西疆各國。自波羅的海畔以迄於黑海之濱。莫不締結互不侵犯條約。德國縱欲與俄翻臉。將必先行摧毁此緩衝之前線。以德國今日之實力。能否如願以償。誠堪疑問竊恐東犯之師未越國境一步。而法比等國聯軍。且將威脅其後矣。矧歐戰未結束。俄匣鮑希維克政府。首先對德議和。戰後。俄國領土之喪失。實不下於德。德人固未嘗以尺寸土地割讓於俄。是以論情度勢。皆不能謂有德俄衝突之理由。在蘇俄旣以維持現狀爲政策。在德人又何所嫌於蘇俄。如以法西斯主義與共產主義之仇視　。遂謂德俄間將不免於正而直接之衝突。則殊覺在錯綜複雜之國際情勢下。不致有如是簡單之推理。故吾人深覺希脱拉之反共。與其認爲對莫斯科之示威。母寗視爲維持其國内獨裁之手腕。一言以蔽之。德俄兩國。實無不得不衝突之理由在。以絶頂聰明之德人。寗見不及此。謂其願在共同對俄之旗幟下。與日勾結。承認僞滿。吾人殊未敢輕信。</p>
<p>或者又曰。今日中德間之貿易。不若日德間之盛。德人權衡商業利益之輕重。自將親日而　華。此論之淺薄可笑。更不値一駁。以中國土地之廣漠。人齒之浩繁。今後世界市塲。孰得與吾華比者。矧當全國努力物質建設之會。機器與機製品之需要。爲數不貲。德國固以工藝精良鳴於世。歐戰後。與我締結平等條約。中德人士之感情。更爲濃厚。將來德國機器與機製品在華之銷路。雖不敢謂凌駕他國而上之。至少亦得並駕齊驅。殆可斷言者也。反之。日本己自農業國地位而漸進至於工業國。德貨在日銷路。殊無逐漸增加之把握。以絶頂聰明之德人。寗見不及此。謂其斤斤較量於目前有限之貿易差額。與日勾結承認僞滿。吾人殊未敢輕信。</p>
<p>或者又曰。希脱拉執政未幾。曾有恢復舊時屬地之揚言。日本自脱離國聯後。依然把持其在太平洋赤道以北之代管地。該代管地固戰前之德屬地也。日人或竟以此爲餌。籠絡德人。以爲己助。亦正難言。不知日人以非國聯會員國而繼續把持國聯委託之代管區。法理方面。巳甚牽强。若視代管區爲私有物。轉以贈人。更何足以自圓其説。國聯與美國。焉能袖手旁觀。默不作聲。一也。日人方將有事於太平洋。上述代管區。固有其軍事上之價値。日人必不肯拱手讓與。二也。德國今日之海軍勢力。卑微不足以齒數。縱能恢復區區孤懸海外之若干珊瑚礁。果何補於海上霸權之角逐。三也。如謂藉此肇端。以期恢復戰前殖民地之舊觀。則若英若法若比若澳洲若紐西蘭。皆將首當其衝。德人樹敵愈多。成功愈難。四也。德人太過熱中於其恢復殖民地之要求。適足影響其軍備平等之立塲。五也凡此五者。皆屬事實。以絶頂聰明之德人。寗見不及此。謂其甘爲小利所紿。與日勾結。承認僞滿。吾人殊未敢輕信。猜度德日勾結之由。不外乎此。而吾人稍加考慮。皆覺其不足置信。然則與日勾結承認僞滿云云。固可不待德方之迭次正式否認。而卽斷定其爲某方假造空氣。以遂其私。且當國聯通過不承認僞滿之决議。德國固爲國聯會員國之一。而投其同意票。及後縱有退會之表示。照章仍須負其未了之義務。而絶無規避之餘地。自國社黨執政後。世人對德態度。不無稍變。事實具在。無可諱言。今爲德國朝野計。自當力謀恢復世界人民之同情。萬一不此之圖妄欲立奇炫異。以聳動世界耳目爲能事。則反動之打擊。亦惟德國自受吾人雅不欲以　威二世視諸德國今日之執政當局。然不敢不掬誠忠告世之一意孤行不惜藐視輿論之向背者。歐戰慘酷之印象。歷歷如昨。要當引爲殷鑒。勿使天下喁喁屬望之和平。由我身而破壞。或經我手而增益破壞之力量。今日中德兩國。同屬被壓迫民族。同受條約束縛之桎梏。同感領土淪亡之痛苦。我友邦德國人士身經之困苦艱難。吾人常致其無限之同情。所望報於德國人士者。亦惟同情而已。吾人深信必不至於失望。</p>

<h3>五十二國都市己可通話　惟中國與日本尙未接通　　美日綫現正在進行之中</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）關於全世界電話通綫之理想現已漸近實現之期、凡環接之各重要都市、人類之聲音無遠弗達、此項事業預定在行將開幕之工程師第五十九週年大會中提出、作第一次電波傳聲之討論、查地球上業己完成之電話網、在美國之人巳可與太平洋及馬尼刺之人交談、又可通過大西洋至阿姆斯特丹·柏林·或白魯塞爾、又可與馬尼刺互相接連、惟自東京及上海至美國間及海洋之大站、均尙須設備大工程、使諸大埠之間、可互相接連通話、據此間負責之工程師稱、由美國至日本間之電話綫前曾遺失、現已赶緊配置、在此二三月内當可竣事、至遲在本年底去、據商務部之交通專家史丹力悉氏稱、美日間之通話業己試騐一年、不久可完備適用、在過去十二月間、美國已可用電話通話至俄國·委内瑞拉·馬尼刺</p>
<p>·危地馬利·巴拿馬·哥斯達·里加·及尼加拉瓜、前此且巳通話至歐洲各國·南美·及菲洲矣、本城之電話用戶、依照電話指導書、祇須付規定之費、卽可通話至暹羅·蘇門答臘·巴塔維亞·孟買·開羅·開希敦·久太（摩洛哥）·火奴魯魯·蒙特維亞·倍諾斯愛勒·里加·雪尼（澳洲）·及世界許多城市、在五十二國之中、可以電話互相通話、僅中國日本未通而已、現在進行中者、爲日美綫、日本至爪哇、以便轉通至歐洲·澳洲·與新西闌至馬尼刺與班多恩之間、業已接通矣、按此項計劃係開始於一八七六年、據今日預算、巳有三千三百萬之電話機可與世界通話、其中美國佔一千七百萬部、並查全世界電話可互通者、已達百分之九十二、如將美國之電話綫接連爲一條單綫、可環繞地球二千四百周云、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>明尼蘇泰聖寳羅明尼蘇泰農工督辦阿爾遜今晚下令調查昨日明納波立斯市政廳前五千失業工人暴動後當局所接得之報告、據報告稱、此次暴動、有共產黨參加担任指揮之職、又據警察之報告稱、當暴民衝入市政廳時、其領隊之著名共產黨員數人、卽鼓勵示威者、以瓦石自窗戶中擲入市政廳、此後警察趕至、遂與暴民發生衝突、結果、暴民之被捕者數達三十人、此外因傷而被送入醫院者亦有十餘人、警察深信共產黨目的、在利用公共工程之停頓、以此爲招致失業工人加入共產黨之手段、因公共工程行政處曾因停工而使數千工人失業也、昨日發生之暴動情形至爲嚴重、示威者堅不肯退、於是警察遂被迫使用流淚彈與水龍始將其驅散云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>哥秘戰機未去</h3>
<p>麗洼琴納樂自哥倫比亞與秘魯二國有繼續戰爭之消息今日傳至此間後、外交方面大爲震動、哥秘二國對於利滴西亞小城之爭、實爲造成二國邦交破裂之主因、且二國之爭此城者已非一朝一夕、利滴西亞本屬哥國、近來則爲國聯所代管、然今日則哥國政府堅决反對國聯之繼續代管、並稱、至遲在六月廿三日國聯必須將該城交還哥國、然他方面則謂秘魯不願將此城無條件的從國聯手中讓交哥國、因該處之形勢至關重要也、故在今後二月内、如再無適當之解决、則哥秘兩國之戰機、大有續發之可能也、政界深信國聯之不能調解波巴戰爭、實暴露國聯管理南美各國之無能、而今日哥秘兩國之爭執、亦卽受其影響云、國聯之所以代管該城者、則因秘魯人民對於該城施加暴行之故、查一九三二年九月一日、秘魯人民組成一隊、以武力攻佔該城、秘魯政府事前雖無所聞、然當哥國向其抗議時、則對於侵佔該處之秘魯暴民、反加庇護、哥國政府於是派遣砲艦以爲奪回該城之地步、此後哥國並向國聯控訴、以求公斷、國聯則建議撤退在該處之秘魯暴民、並設立三人委員會以代管之、故該城自彼時起、卽成一中立地、然國聯對於該城之處理、至今未得哥秘二國之滿意云、（七日國民電）</p>

<h3>日政潮又起　　齋藤内閣進退失據　政友會態度亦硬化</h3>
<p>（東京）齋藤首相近將往訪西園寺公爵之結果、召開三長老會議、决計維持現狀、企圖延長内閣壽命、行使凖備工作、對於候補文相、原擬起用大藏省政務次長掘切氏、但該次長固辭不受、遂歸失敗、近又擬將該項候補問題暫行擱置、另向更新政策進取、並擬於十日定例閣議席上、極力説明方針、要求閣員諒解、以便克復目下之難局、而促同人之奮起、三長老對於積極刷新政策意見、雖屬一致、而政界之一部分人士、對於會之態度、頗抱不滿、現已計畫猛烈之倒閣運動、尤其爲目下進行中之某重大事件、更給與彼輩以利用之機、甚至一舉而打倒内閣、亦未可料、刻下策動多忙、極形活躍、其事勢之發展若何、内閣維持現狀當感困難、政局前途恐未許樂觀也云（八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）齋藤首相之補充文相第二工作、將如何進行、殊堪注目、此際首相雖謂從緩進行、但目下情勢、不容内閣常者不安、若儘此推移、反使人心離散、故齋藤首相終將向貴族院之鵜澤總明、竹越與三郎·與三上參次博士等交涉、請求入閣、惟在政府與政友會絶緣狀態之際、鵜澤與竹越亦有難色、卽三上博士恐亦不易允諾、總之、齋藤首相於九日晨返京後、將與高橋山本兩相會晤討論、其時或竟實行改造閣内、或僅補充文相、敷衍一時、頗堪注目、（八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）日政局因補充文相問題又復惹起波瀾、貴院對於政局前途觀測如下、文相問題若在齋藤内閣健在之際、當可簡易解决、惟如今之衰弱狀態、難免不難產、而證明内閣方在崩潰過程、齋藤首相於訪問西園寺公之前、不補充文相、諒因有掛冠之意、其後心機轉變、决意維持、而第一工作竟歸失敗、有失内閣威信、故今後無論採何方策、恐不能根本解决、至今後之文相後任、當然向政友會交涉、但與個人交涉、同甚困難、故政府暫時將觀望形勢、講求次善策、卽或獲得如何人物、而情形已至於此、前途頗多困難、然鑑於綱紀問題、以及近衛公之組閣説、政黨提携運動之發展等、齋藤内閣之前途、尙不容樂觀也、（八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）政友會近因政府對於候補文相案、甚至與掘切善兵衛氏開始直接交涉、故黨内之大勢突然硬化、同時該黨幹部爲處理此種新形式、正在愼重研究其對策、以便决定黨的方針、茲聞其大致情形如下、（一）政府對政友會採取非善意之態度、蓋卽表示政友會不足信賴也、吾人自今以後、應勿顧慮與政府之關係、無論對於任何問題、當以嚴正之是非主義、向政策本位邁進、對於最近豫想之政變、應有覺悟之必要（二）關於米榖對策、倘召集臨時議會時、政友會當預行提出米榖對策案、與政府所提出之方案、發生出入時、决計與政府堂堂宣戰、縱令本黨横被解散、亦須貫徹主張、（三）倘不召集臨時議會、而政變之到來、亦不無機會可乘、故政友會應以國民生活爲基本、而樹立新政策、以爲凖備、並於今後更當努力恢復政黨之信用、以上所述、皆係政友會之重心所在、今後注視政府態度與政局推移、决不使該黨之進退有所遺悞云、（八日日聯電）</p>

<h3>軍縮定期開議　美國政府發表文告　不允參加制裁公約</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法外長巴爾都今日與軍縮會議主席漢德森會談甚久、聞已决定以五月二十三日召集軍縮總委員會、近日盛傳四月二十三日爲該委員會開會之期、茲之展緩、其故有三、（一）使英法得繼續討論保障問題、（二）使巴爾都得與波蘭及小恊約國會商、因羅馬尼亞外相蒂杜爾婁斯柯日内將抵巴黎、巴爾都又將於本月杪赴華沙與柏拉格也、（三）俾得從容佈置一切、漢德森現赴日内瓦、俾星期二日主持軍縮主幹部會議、美國務總長赫爾今日在華盛頓發表文告、聲明美國對於制裁違反任何軍縮公約者一舉、並未正式有所允諾、又稱、軍縮會議之美代表台維斯現仍在假期中、並未奉命作任何諾言云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國政界　對法照會滿意</h3>
<p>軍縮談判進入新階段</p>
<p>（倫敦）據可靠消息、法政府對英國備忘錄之覆文、表示願與英國交換意見、締結公約、在此公約中、德國理置軍備之要求、可予承認、惟此種軍備須有限制、而此限制、以完全國際管理與監視爲依歸此種管理與監視亦適用於其他各簽字國、上述消息、今日在此發表後、軍縮公約成立之希望乃復活、聞法政府歡迎英政府再行討論實施保障問題、法政府允日内詳細答覆英國所詢各點、但鑒於日内瓦星期二日之會議、遂建議繼續英法間之討論、聞法國覆文之最近影響、卽爲目前或可研究締結一種限於歐洲之公約、以期在指定範圍内、安定軍備問題、此約可包括歐洲全部、並連蘇俄在内、此約或將載一附則、保障蘇俄在日本拒絶締結相當條約時、有添置軍備用於遠東之自由、另訂一約、由美國加入、卽可成立普遍管理與監視軍備之制度、惟德報謂、法國僅爲一策略作用所驅動、紐約消息則謂、美國不改變關於制裁之政策、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國政府昨爲軍縮問題致送英政府之口頭照會、此間政界頗爲滿意、此由星期日出版各報之言論可以見之、例如星期泰晤士報謂、此項口項照會可使軍縮問題之全部討論進入重要之新階段、有此照會、則軍縮公約卽有訂立之可能矣、觀察報謂、法國外部致送英外部之口頭照會、係對法國軍縮政策作一新頴而又重要之解釋、有此、則掌蠒大臣艾登前赴日内瓦、可抱有較大之希望、蓋軍縮會議主席團必可有所作爲、不致以延會爲能事、因而失望也、該報又謂、法國照會對於英國政策目前卽有一種効力、卽英國得以研究、是否能於英國計畫所規定之數量以下、申全歐洲各國訂立局部恊定、以求軍備之不再增加、而非如外間所云僅由西歐各國訂立特别恊定、一般人現所考慮者、乃於一般公約之範圍内、分訂若干條約、例如歐洲全部國家、包含蘇俄在内、可訂立一種條約、其中包含一種附件、謂日本對於與該國相關之軍縮條約、如拒絶簽字時、則蘇俄有權在遠東設置軍備、如此則蘇俄在外交上不啻成爲兩個單位、此外又可訂立一種條約、將美國包括在内、此約則當創立一種關於軍備之普遍監察制、總之、法國照會發出後之第一步希望、卽歐洲各國所能承認之軍縮公約、究以何種方法、保障其切實履行一層、今後各國可望得到同意矣云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>近衛定期渡美</p>
<h3>廣田力謀刷新外交　改組外務省充實使領人員　對於用人則採取人材主義</h3>
<p>（東京）貴族院議長近衛文磨公訂於五月十七日搭乘淺間丸由橫濱起程渡美、但爲考慮前途各種情形及關於軍縮問題與外交方針、曾與廣田外相會見、探聽日美外交之根本方針、除擬晤大角海相外、並預定本月十四五日往訪西園寺公、將目下之政局及各方面之情形報告後、擬向園公陳述意見云、（八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田外相爲刷新外交人事計、决將外務省之局課先行改組、除原有歐</p>
<p>美·亞細亞·通商·三局外、添設美洲局、因此各局所分担之事務略有變更、乃利用此機、以圖事務簡便、而謀肅淸積弊、現各局之名稱、雖尙未决定、而其分課規定大致决定如云、</p>
<p>（一）美洲局計分三課如下、第一課、掌理北美事務、第二課、掌理中南美洲之一般關係、第三課、掌理護照事務（由通商局分離）、（二）歐美局改稱歐洲局、内分三課如下、第一課、堂理蘇聯及其接近之阿富汗斯坦·波斯·土耳其·芬蘭·等國之事務、第二課、掌理歐洲各國之事務、第三課、乃另行新設者、掌理明年之軍縮會課結束後、則管理澳洲印度等處之各國植民地自治領等等關係事務、（三）亞細亞局改稱東亞局、内部分課規定不加變理、（四）通商局内三課如下、第一課、研究對外通商條約及其政策、第二課、爲通商局之中心、處理通商各事務、以便運用實施、如日荷會商或日英會商時、當研究其制度、以便與對方交涉、第三課、掌理移民事務及國内斯界之關係事務、（八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田外相現以本届議會旣經平穩結束、而對美對俄等等關係、亦經半載之努力、漸次轉佳、更欲舉其所謂萬邦恊和之外交、最近則頻促駐英大使齋藤·駐法大使佐藤·駐土耳其大使武者小路·駐華公使有吉等歸國、以便商議對外之和平方針、而使之對於社會政治經濟方面之國内情形、得到充分之認識、現聞外相尤不以此爲滿足、更關於左列各件力謀刷新、以期徹底、其改革之情形如下、</p>
<p>（一）外交事務以簡捷處理爲凖、將外務省之組織根本改造、</p>
<p>（二）力謀駐外外交機關之充實、</p>
<p>（三）刷新人事、廣收人材、錄用與任命均須擴充範圍、以便活用、</p>
<p>（四）爲達到上項目的計、須將外交官試騐行使根本改革、</p>
<p>以上各點經廣田外相設法計畫、目下己將其具體方略正着手進行、此爲日本外務省空前之盛舉、外相之謀略、無非爲警戒一九三五六年之國際危局、極被一般所注目、至外務省之改組情形、曾於本年度預算案中亦經提有設立美洲局、而其官制與分課規定等等情形、目五正與法制局商議中、下星期當可提出於樞府會議、查外務省從來係以本省爲中心、而行使訓令外交、與駐外使臣稍欠完全之連絡、故擬自九年度起、縮少本省人員、</p>
<p>而增加駐外使館及領事階級之人員、使之負担充分之責任、而圖事務上之合理化、對於人事則採取人材主義、選㧞優秀分子、以開起用之途徑、廢除以年齡席次而昇級之辦法、對於任用外交官、從來徒存自由任用之形式、各方面均能推舉大使公使、而外務省則固執於狹義之門羅主義、以閉塞在野人物之進路、故上項自由形式、抑且有名無實、今鑒於此種狀態、此後爲應付經濟外交之重要性起見、須積極活用其自由任用制度、關於外交官試騐方法、亦須改良課目、除國際法·外交史·政治經濟學、以外當加入社會學·文學·哲學等等、其餘如筆記試騐、口頭試騐、體格考查、但不偏重、恐易陷弊端、故宜打破舊時習慣、將採用常識充分之有爲人物、並訂於本年七月起、開始實施新規之外交官試騐、（八日日聯電）</p>

<p>加州聖彼特羅今日官塲公佈、美國現駐聖彼特羅及聖蒂亞哥洋面之艦隊、在美國海軍大將塞羅氏指揮下、將於星期一日駛赴巴拿馬、舉行操演、該艦隊之組織、共分戰鬥與哨探二種、參加操演者、總共一百十三艦、海軍士官三千七百人、水兵四萬四千人、參加戰艦之種類、則分潛水艇·運輸艦·砲艦·及快艇、此外則有驅逐艦一隊、該艦隊將於五月五日離巴拿馬運河地帶、此後卽將加緊操演、並取道加里濱駛赴紐約、以備羅斯福總統五月三十一日在哈特遜河檢閲、美國艦隊之全體能在滿哈登洋面操、實爲丹奈爾於一九一八年爲美國海軍部長時舉行平時檢閲後之創舉、外間揣測、操演中之艦隊將於本年秋季返歸太平洋防次、此次顯示美國政府並不以太平洋之現局爲緊張、故暫時撤退美國西海岸之艦隊、以表示美國所抱之政策也、自一九三二年美國海軍舉行檢閲後、其哨探與戰鬥艦隊卽行合併、長駐太平洋、其所以駐留太平洋之原因有二、一爲美國行政當局欲節省海軍部之費用、二爲便利海軍訓練計劃之實施、美國加州議員度克惠勒對於在紐約舉行之海軍檢閲發表評語、認遠東現勢緊張、而美國竟撤退太平洋岸之艦隊、實爲不智云、（七日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本六十五議會閉幕（日本通信）　議會政治的晚景　軍國政治的抬頭</h3>
<p>兩個多月以來、風波重疉的六十五議會、算是平妥的閉幕了、在議會正式開會之前、大家都以爲日本的議會政治、恐怕要成爲德意志議會之續、其支配政治的人、當然不是起自民間的國社黨、而是擁有槍砲的軍閥、却是因爲國際上外交孤立、對蘇關係緊張、而又不敢輕於啓釁、所以引起軍部本身的不統一、與民間的責難、議會開幕之初、資本家方面爲維護自己的利益起見、不能不一致對付軍閥和依附軍閥的官僚、所以有政友會民政黨二者、合同的擬議、這就是對付軍部限制軍權的一種暗示、</p>
<p>及至荒木貞夫辭去陸軍部長以後、形勢稍見和緩、議會中確曾有過好幾次對軍紀嚴重的質問、軍部雖一時陷於苦境、終因牠實權在握、加以侵略有功、而以財閥爲背景的議員、民衆對於他們、也老早就有點厭倦、卽一般輿論、也很不値他們之所爲、因此終於祗能施放空砲、而不敢眞正的肉搏、在嚴重質問軍紀問題的那幾天、議會確有挽回若干頽勢氣象、博得多少好評、假使眞能一往直前、則恢復　政當道、亦未可知、</p>
<p>然而軍部的手腕、也正不弱、同時牠又曉得各政黨都各有其汚點、又各有不平分子存在其中、所以第一就發生商工部長中島久萬吉推崇叛逆足利尊氏的問題、迫使他不能不辭職、這不是給内閣的打擊、而是给政黨以嚴重不利的影響、但這雖屬於所謂綱紀的範圍、與其説是不利於政黨、還不如説不利於政府還多些、於是第二個問題又起來了、這就是岡本一己所提的敎育部長鳩山一郎的受賄問題、經審查的結果、鳩山並未受賄、而五萬元的欵子、却是給政友會的捐欵、同時又發現民政黨也有類似的事件、如此鳩山本人、雖沒有受賄的形跡、可是政黨的劣點、却暴露出來了、在前、關於政黨依附財閥作背景的事、雖爲人所揭出、但一般社會對此、還是將信將疑、並且也有人加以原宥、經過這一次在議會裏正式暴露出來以後、政黨政治的信譽、眞是掃地以盡、這不特鳩山個人不能再戀棧敎長的位置、鈴木喜三郎也連帶受影響、而且政友會民政黨都同受惡評、議會政治恢復的機會、就從此失去了</p>
<p>原來這次的預算案的成立、是很勉强、照日本現時國力、是嫌其過重的、普通會計二十一億一千萬日金的支出、再加上通信事業特别會計一億　九千萬圓的支出、總計有二十三億日金、而普通會計中陸海軍費支出、竟占九億三千六百萬圓、居普通支出的百分之四十四、這是議會要恢復憲政常道所不能容許、更是日本一般民衆所難於勝任的重負、然而畢竟通過了、特别是軍費、分文未曾削减、就此卽知軍部的力量、依舊很大、議會還是備位諮詢罷了、至於其他的重要問題、如學校問題、從近三十所學校校長受賄案到思想惡化、並未求得解答、地方行政改革、也還是毫無頭緒、而經濟方面的各農村負債六十億日金、毫沒有辦法、米祗好由政府收積起來堆在倉裏、工業的景氣、是由政府的放欵政策與軍需工業的剌激、等等切切、都使日本人更不滿於議會、更令議會政治頽廢化、於是所謂非常時代、要越見延長、軍部的跋　、也要越厲害了、（一九三四年三月二十九日於東）</p>

<h3>日本改築　天圖路軌竣工</h3>
<p>便利軍運防制蘇俄</p>
<p>搜羅沿綫各種出產</p>
<p>長春通訊、日本在東北積極經營鐵道、其用意之深遠及目的所在、令人莫測、但其表面、一則曰日滿民族親善、共謀交通發展、繁榮東北、再則曰促進東北文化、維持東亞和平、其實乃有野心在也、如此次改築天圖鐵路、（由天寳山至圖們江）以一年有半之時間、將該鐵改築寛軌、現已竟其全功、而其决心爲此者、以該綫在軍事上對於防制蘇俄、可發生絶大效能、此外日人并將天圖綫經過附屬地域之鑛產·農產·人口·貿易·等情、詳細調查、茲照日方所調查者錄後、</p>
<h3>沿綫人口物產</h3>
<p>天圖鐵路、現由日僞改名爲京圖路、自民國十三年十月間開通、（自開山屯至老頭溝共十三站）隔圖們江而與朝鮮三峯起之圖們鐵路相銜接、此次開通、則改爲龍井村、東盛湧·八道河子·石門子·開山屯各站、自有天圖鐵路以來、乃綜攬延吉縣邊交通之牛耳、蓋延吉和龍兩縣、依前年日方調查、其面積和龍爲三百七十萬方里、延吉爲五百十八萬方里、和龍戶數爲一萬八千三百八十四戶、共計十萬八千三百八十四人、延吉戶數爲四萬七千零九十九戶、共計二十六萬三千六百二十七人、延吉縣土地總面積爲一七九·八八八町、内中共計有耕地面積爲七二·二二○町、和龍縣土地總面積爲一四九·九四二町、内耕地面積爲二一·八三八町、總計耕地爲九四·○五八町、其每年農業收穫、延吉縣爲一·一九一·六三石、和龍縣爲二八三·九○○石、共計每年總出產額爲一·四七五·五三石、其中大豆佔有總數量百分之三五、乃至百分之五○、米穀類佔百分之三七、查此項多量之收穫、除本地之少量銷耗外、其大量則多賴此鐵路運輸出口、此廣漠之土地、尤須依此鐵路綫而開發富源、故該路在時間性或空間性上、均佔重要地位、</p>
<h3>運輸農產量數</h3>
<p>從前延邊之貿易、以延吉爲中心、而輸入輸出之路程、則多經由吉林及琿春、而向俄國輸出、自日本大正六年淸會綫開通時起、在本埠（龍井村）設立東拓及朝鮮銀行等金融機關、大正九年、在會寗及上三峯之間、築成圖們鐵路、自是聯絡本埠貿易、始見頻繁、大正十六年、天圖輕便鐵路竣工、於是本埠之金融機關與時俱增、故去年所貿易之總數、己達八百萬元、因此交通機開及其他事業、亦日趨繁華、茲將去年天圖鐵路輸出穀類數量列左、</p>
<p>產地大豆白豆綠荳粟其他合計</p>

<p>以上農產出口運輸、除延吉外、仍多賴南迥綫之運輸、其後吉敦綫及拉賓綫開通之後、此等穀類在拉法羅津港未完竣以前、多以淸津港爲標及中心、</p>
<h3>輸出輸入統計</h3>
<p>又據僞國境日本税關之調查、自昭和元年至五年間、貿易頗呈繁盛狀態、自僞國創立以來、至去年延邊貿易總數量爲二千萬元、因此延邊各地之產業、及其他各種事業、日有發展、故延邊之貿易、實以龍埠爲中心、又自天圖鐵路改築寬軌後、運輸交通、愈趨便利、因此由龍井村與朝鮮内地貿易聯絡、將更有密切之好景象、茲查淸津延邊間之輸出輸入金額列左、</p>

<h3>『小小十年』中所表現的婚姻問題（二）</h3>
<p>昨日劉漢雲君在葉永榛著的小説『小小十年』中提出了對於婚姻問題的二則懐疑。本部根據劉君之懷疑，分别致答如后。編者</p>
<p>那末、我們再看你所提出的兩家的意見吧。</p>
<p>『勇敢者，』以爲靑年絶對要不客氣的和環境奮門，尤其是應該先從那買賣式的婚姻開刀。是的，在近來許多文藝作品中，就往往以逃出舊式婚姻的束缚，作爲革命靑年描寫的對象。當然，這是沒有什麽要不得的，有勇氣向上的人，絶不應該顧到『那已同床的妻』而阻碍自己的前途。不過，若把這寫成解决婚姻的主要課，題就未免過火了。試問，單抛了那同床的妻，是不是就打倒了買賣式的婚姻呢？是不是就衡破了黑暗，獲得了幸福呢？顯然是沒有這樣簡單的。</p>
<p>『妥恊者，』以爲資本主義社會内的戀愛是靠不住的，與其受着『失戀』『離婚』的痛苦，倒不如要個鄉下姑娘，來得好。這也是實在的情形，但這却近於『因噎廢食』的見解。婚烟制度的變革，旣是受着社會的支配，人是沒有力量把進展的社會拖回原地位去的，你因爲怕痛苦，而不敢嘗試戀愛，然而沒有愛情的婚姻，不僅不能從你精神上的安慰，且要成爲你的生活上的贅疣。那你將如何解釋呢？固然，愛情是可以創造的，如劉君便是一個例子，但愛情並不是無條件的可以創造出來。一個大資本家能和一個鄉下蠢姑娘創造愛情嗎？一個時髦小姐能和滿身臭汗的工人創造愛情嗎？卽有，也是變態的，例外的，不能引以爲解决一切婚姻問題的根據。顯然地，『拆衷者』所提出的問題，不是戀愛本身的問題，乃是戀愛對象的問題，如果照這種主張去解决婚姻，是等於沒有解决。</p>
<p>可見這兩家的意見，均是不正確的，這不正確，是因他們均是從戀愛至上主義出發，而我願去掘發問題的根源。</p>
<p>我們應該怎樣來解决這矛盾呢？</p>
<p>回答是：我們應該從自己的生活上去求解决，從自己對於社會的任務上去求解决；這就</p>
<p>是説，無論對舊式婚姻或新的戀愛，我們的取捨，是應該以那有帮助於我們的生活，至少不妨礙我們的生活來决定。戀愛並不是人生的第一義，而是處於從屬的地位。</p>
<p>我們是處在一個新與舊的過渡時代裏，新的社會制度沒有建立，而舊的已無可挽回的在崩潰。我們旣不能等待，我們也無從盲目地向前亂衝。我們的主要任務，是我們怎樣用我們的力量來推動新的社會、以加速那建築在眞忱愛情基礎上的婚姻在新社會内完成。我們要打破舊式婚姻；但如果那已同床的妻，並沒有妨礙我們當前的事業，甚至可以和我們在同一生活綫上生活着的話，那我們也並不一定要離婚，我們是需要自由戀愛的、但如果只是爲了那戀愛的虚名，爲了時髦的誘惑，而認識的對象，其生活又和我們格格不相入，那我們還是回到我們舊老婆懷裏去好；反之，如果我們的愛人是完全能和我們站在同樣生活的基調上，我們的愛人，能帮助我們完成我們的社會任務，那卽使我們的舊老婆如花似玉，卽使要和我們的家庭破裂，也是不能顧及的。柯倫泰的戀愛觀，就是從這樣的觀點出發，他並不是主張亂交，而是説，在大革命的潮流中，你不要由戀愛問題而妨礙了你的主要工作。</p>
<p>當然、人是感情的動物，我們這樣説，也許過於偏重理智而至於忽視了感情，但是，感情不是别的產物，也是從生活產生出來所，如果生活不同調，愛情是决不會强固的。在這裏，我們可以舉一個例來説，有一本蘇聯羅曼諾夫著的『愛的分野，』它是描寫革命後的一個農民，到了城市裏工作。這時，他的社會地位提高了，於是他要想嚐嚐戀愛。他盡方忘記他的鄉下老婆，而和一個資產階級的小姐同居。最初他們尙能相安，但相處久了，那小姐，雖然是一個沒落階級的小姐，她的階級劣性，還是要隨時顯露出來的。她要跳舞，要狂樂：這樣，便煩惱了那粗野的只曉得工作的農民，結果，終於受不住煩惱而回到了那勤樸的鄉下老婆的身邊。看了，該明白所謂愛情是怎麽一回事了吧。</p>
<p>總之，舊婚烟制度的打破，是要從改造整個社會着手，而我們目前的婚姻問題，更應該站在共同生活的基調上，以能帮助達到或者不妨礙我們的前途來决定。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>後來，又到了一所空閉着的宫殿上，伊忽然用極低的聲音，獨自感嘆起來。我因爲緊隨在伊的肩後的緣故，可以很不費力的聽伊説道：</p>
<p>『這一個寳座，就是我們的兒子，在行加冕禮時所坐的！我們至今好像還可以見他坐在那裏。－景象是跟昨天一樣－他所穿的是全套最高貴的服飾』。</p>
<p>伊的感嘆是這樣的靜穆，而伊的思潮却受了這個可以紀念的加冕禮的衝動，不住的在起伏。當這個加冕禮舉行的時候，也就是伊三度攝政的起點。這種種情形，簡直是同昨天一樣。而伊現在所站的地方，也就是昨天所站的地方！伊目不轉睛地注視着伊的嬰兒在這上面行加冕禮的那個寳座，好久不作一聲，也不回頭來看伊身後排列着的一行隨從。伊只低下了頭，拂過了第一個女官，以至於最後的一個小太監，又穿往别的殿上去了。</p>
<p>伊又指着另一座宫殿告訴我們、這是咸豐死後停靈之所、伊説得是非常的眞切，我們彷彿看見有一個已死的咸豐，躺在伊所指着的地方。而他所丢下來的一副千金重擔，只得讓他的嬌弱的愛妃給他擔住了。－就是現在這個溫和的老婦人。</p>
<p>在沒有到這裏來以前，太后已曾告訴過我許多關於伊自己的歷史；現在，伊就把當日最繁華，最幸福的幾段事情所發生的地點，一一指點給我認識。這對於伊，是多麽傷心啊！但是當我們後來離開了熱河行宫回到北京，走進了頤和園的大門之後，這些悲痛的陳跡，便絶不費事的擲出了我們的腦神經外去了，猶如翻過了一頁歷史一樣；而從此，這一部份的歷史便永遠不再有人去翻看了！（六）</p>
<h3>號召</h3>
<p>— 徐豪吾</p>
<p>吃飽了飯，沒有事，緩步經過愛多亞路，爲好奇心所驅使，就在路旁測字擹邊，駐足而觀。</p>
<p>也不知道還是攤子剛剛擺好，生意尙未曾開始，所以攤子周圍，除掉我和『測字先生』面面相覷外，還沒有旁的人站著。『測字无生』</p>
<p>不慌不忙，站定了身子，磨了一回墨；然後提起那蘸飽了墨的筆，將筆桿的一頭，塞進嘴裏，輕輕咬住，就此以口代手、颼、颼、寫出『談相减價五位』來。</p>
<p>人漸漸地圍攏來了。</p>
<p>『測字先生』擱起了筆，另外用食指的尖頭，塗滿了墨，在字的旁邊，輕描淡寫，添上幾隻振翅欲飛的鳥；鳥的嘴是用不蘸墨的指甲勾引出來的，旣長又細，何等逼眞！</p>
<p>這時候圍攏來的人，已很擁擠；而且攤旁那隻留給主顧坐的凳子，已爲捷足者先佔去了。</p>
<p>説句實話，測字的『藝術』，根本不在口書指畫上面，但是賣江湖的敲鑼打鬧塲；商店登廣告播無綫電：『要人』吹法螺釣名沽譽；設攤測字的除『憑機批判』</p>
<p>，『口不留情』外，自然也該小弄玄虚，有號召羣衆的能力，否則寒儒落拓，憑你滿腹經綸，冷淸淸地坐在那裏，還是够不上路人側目以視的！</p>
<h3>春</h3>
<p>— 徐月玲</p>
<p>春已偷偷地來到人間！</p>
<p>這幾天，陽光是那麽和煦，走路的人，都軟綿綿的像失去了知覺般：年靑的夥子，心地是何等焦燥，春風，它並沒有帶給『他們的期望』，祇一些興奮和無聊矛盾地交織在他們的心頭，沉重的，昏悶的，把一顆顆活躍的『心』，包圍着，緊緊的包圍。</p>
<p>我們的高貴的姑娘，深居在富麗的紅樓中，『巧格力』的味道己感到苦澀，講堂中的陰陽怪氣的理論，或者，聽瞎子算命要比較有聊些。嫩嫩的，誰願走動？伊惱恨春的來臨太不該打扮得這般濃艷，這般醉人，使伊空虚的心，永遠是那般空虚！</p>
<p>平時最愛着的一集『人體美術』，這兩天反覺厭惡起來，恨恨地，摔在地上；眼前，伊是需要刺戟，濃烈的刺戟。偶然，憶起李後主的『花明月黯飛輕霧，今朝好向郎邊去······』輕微的聲音在伊的唇邊吐出。</p>
<p>看！我們的姑娘陶醉了，悠悠地陶醉在春的懷抱中。</p>

<p>第二十七回　閨怨暗中消慈懷可感　閒悉醉後起舊事難忘</p>
<p>究竟母親是疼愛女兒的，江氏也不曾驚動誰，悄悄的就走進屋子裏來了。見桂枝這個樣子，兩手扶了床沿，將頭伸着，望子桂枝的臉道：孩子，你又怎魔了？他説話的聲音，旣微小，又和軟，臉上還帶了一些苦笑。桂枝看到這種情形，趕快放下了枕頭，也笑道：您瞧，這不是怪事嗎？昨晚上沒有睡到枕頭上來，把眼睛睡得浮腫了，今天怎樣見人？江氏道：你是睡腫的嗎？不是的吧？桂枝笑道：那麽，您一定説我是哭腫了。我又不是戀乳的，毛孩子，成晚的哭些什麽？江氏見他不肯承認，自然也有他的一番苦情，便是讓他直説出來了，自己也無非是空安慰他一番而已，這並不能减少他什麽痛苦，便道：旣是那麽着你就多躺一會子罷，又何必爬起來呢？桂枝道：我這雙眼睛實在也不好意思見人，今天上上，我在家裏躺躺兒，這邊老太爺的事，請您看着小林作罷。江氏倒也不願趙翁看到他眼睛這樣腫，果然，替桂枝放下門簾，替他安排家務去了。桂枝一人坐在臥室裏，沒有什麽未解除寂寞的，少不得更是要想。想想自己，又想想黃曼英，他想着，我看到他和男朋友在一處講話，心裏擱下了這件事，就兩三天也丢不了。但不知他們的事讓我撞見了，心裏還想不想？姑娘們和情人在一處談話的事情，快活是眞快活，害怕可也是眞害怕，記得初次和甘積之上乳茶，舖子裏談話，心都跳碎了。回家來見着母親，臉上先就紅了。也不知道是什麽原因，好像穿單衣服過數九寒天一樣，由心裏抖顫着出來。（三五七）</p>

<h3>遊民</h3>
<p>— 曹文楠</p>
<p>在巴黎有一個警察捉到一遊民，帶到警察局。這遊民不能講一句法國話（他只能講德國話）而審判官則不懂德語；所以他請了一個通譯官來詢問。</p>
<p>『你生在那裏的？』審判官問他。</p>
<p>『在巴黎』。</p>
<p>『在巴黎？那末你是法國人了······』</p>
<p>『不，審判先生，我不是法國人，我是德國人。』</p>
<p>『但是，因爲你生在法國，當然你是法國人！』</p>

<p>三·眉子石無聊天天天説這枯燥無味的石塊，讀者不免厭棄了罷，今天正說到眉子石，當時取這眉子兩字的意義，不過因石紋像人的眉毛罷了，然而一般風流學士，就想到『螓首蛾眉』『淡掃蛾眉』的意思上去，（稱眉紋之纎而長者曰蛾眉石）視同美人一樣的可愛，於是贊美眉子硯的詩歌，遂做得格外起勁，蘇東坡有一首眉子硯歌，最有意思，並足以代表當時的時代情形，錄之於左，以調和讀者諸君一時的口味。歌云，</p>
<p>君不見成都畫手開十眉。橫雲却月爭新奇。遊人指點淺顰處。中有漁陽胡馬嘶。又不見王孫靑瑣横雙碧。腸斷浮空遠山色。書生性命何足論。坐費千金買消渴。爾來喪亂愁天公。謫向君家書硯中。小窗虚幌相嫵媚。令君曉夢生春紅。毘耶居士談空處。結習已空花不住。試敎天女爲磨鉛。千偈瀾翻無一語。諸君讀此，發生些甚麽感想，長公還有以寳劍易張近龍尾硯的詩，亦甚</p>
<p>幽豔，但無聊急要說到無情的頑石上去，只好割愛了，眉子紋石，在宋代因此更爲尊貴，其色或靑或紫，眉之短者簇者如臥蠶犀紋，長者闊者如虎斑紋，雁攢湖對眉，最稱精絶。分别其名稱，亦有十二種。</p>
<p>金花眉子有金花散布者</p>
<p>金暈眉子硯面有金暈如雲</p>
<p>金星眉子眉紋疎有二三點金星</p>
<p>對眉子如眉形成對最潔潤</p>
<p>短眉子眉短而分散不聚集一處者</p>
<p>長眉子硯面有三數條長二三寸</p>
<p>簇眉子細紋密集一處</p>
<p>闊眉子有生氣若彪紋</p>
<p>雁湖眉子作海上羣雁飛集狀</p>
<p>錦蹙眉子石暈如雲霞頗華麗</p>
<p>菉豆眉子眉紋中有靑豆大斑點</p>
<p>鱔肚眉子眉疎色如鱔魚肚</p>
<p>眉子坑又有一種水浪紋，石理堅細，狀如微風拂波，有漣如織，亦一美紋也。</p>
<p>上述根據硯箋，惟據他書所載，在眉子坑外之水舷坑，亦多金紋眉子，色靑，有如鶴舞者，如長壽仙人者，如雙鴛鴦者，如枯槎仙人者，如朝霞雲蒸者，如湖中寒雁者，如雙魚蹲鴟者，如壼瓶者，如臥蠶者，如升斗形</p>
<p>者，宋人好事者，象其形狀而作種種名種。</p>
<p>此外尙有盧坑，出一種靑色綠暈之眉子紋羅紋，俱有金星，據日人坂東說，金星有無無關係，蓋金星有隱有顯，如有輝綠巖一種，浮於石面者，則發寳光，隱於中者卽不見，然其石質必同一嫩凈也。又濟源坑石，與盧坑同一瑩潤，俱稱佳品，但濟源僅有一二絲柔軟之紋，羅紋眉紋甚少。</p>

<h3>優游勢盛連中二球</h3>
<p>馬顯兒鳴笛啓戰、優游在西得風勢之助、屢向東郊發難、沈世琦低綫傳中、好萊斯汀失之於前、格林勃又失之於後、胡有成坐享其成、力射入網、無何、沈相貴與許文奎互傳至低綫、爲敵後衛逼成角球、小沈開向中央、胡有成欲射不得、沈世琦得勢搗門、又告得手、觀衆莫不欣然色喜、預祝優游可期、</p>
<h3>猶太反攻三城連陷</h3>
<p>此際猶太反攻烈熱、優游三關時告吃緊、張容救球心急、跌傷右臂、爲人扶掖出塲、優游急調沈相貴回防、以塡其缺、猶太乘機大肆刦掠、Ｌ格林勃得朋切克之助、邁步攻門、楊金銘雖曾拍着、但依然滑入網底、成二對一、未幾、Ｌ格林勃在廿碼處、以峻急脚頭低射一記、造成和局、此時優游窘態畢露、攻旣不能、守亦不可、Ｌ格林勃單槍匹馬、攪入人叢、造成三對二、後來居上之優勢、</p>
<h3>最後努力奪得錦標</h3>
<p>下半時優游已抱不勝必死之大志、放棄保守主義、前綫攻打烈熱、沈世琦其快如飛、稍一得隙、卽鑽至二十碼處、砰然一聲、打中要害、又成平手、三分鐘後、胡有成福至心靈、（因沈世琦一勾、乃直衝入内、狄特律出門太早、兩不碰頭、竟爲胡安然撥入門内、成四對三、再五分鐘、程貽澤在罰球綫轉身力射、狄特律措手不及、乃成五對三之比數、猶太雖思恢復河山、然優游勝利在握、當然不肯讓人、直　戰至休息時間、終無發展、優游於是獲得錦標矣、</p>

<h3>香港國際杯足球賽威爾殊勝華聯結果三比一　李惠堂等助戰無效</h3>
<p>（香港通訊）每年一度之國際慈善杯足球大比賽本届己於本月二日下午三時三十分、在跑馬地香港會球塲决賽、查得决賽權者爲中華隊與威爾殊隊、此中西兩隊、實爲全港中之最勁者、經過九十分鐘之劇烈戰爭、威爾殊竟以三比一勝中華隊、奪得本届國際杯錦標而歸、誠光榮極矣、查威爾殊隊、抵港以來、亦有數年、當其初抵本埠、卽有勁旅之稱、惟該隊對於各項錦標、除嘗一度染指特别銀牌外、均被擯於門外、而受屈於華隊者亦屢、在該隊亦云不幸矣、迨本届華隊失敗、而該隊遂造成抵港以來未有之創作、特别銀牌也、國際杯也、均已入於該隊之手、卽將近結束之尋常杯正式比賽、亦非該隊莫屬焉、</p>
<p>下午三時半旣届、兩隊球員在細雨霏霏之下、出塲小試脚頭、因連日天雨不絶、草地塲己盡濕、泥濘不堪、舉止間巳　失常、迨球證訊芝鳴笛開賽、雙方卽作劇烈之進攻、華隊李惠堂射門不中</p>
<p>而退、威爾殊乘勢反攻、潑摩作遠射高去、斯時雙方門前均呈險象、苦戰久之、威爾殊突乘華隊引師進攻之後、衝出反攻、華隊後衛空虚、劉茂獨力難支、被其長驅直進在離門數碼時、劉與威隊球員糾纒、球滾滾而來、包衝出舉足一踢、球中兩球之身滾入網内、華隊首告失利、五前鋒以負後非努力反攻不可、遂聯合大舉侵襲、得機射門中的者多次、乃竟被無名之史蔑夫救去、華隊力侵無功、威隊又乘虚而入、馬汰士抛過李國威傳中、華隊後方一亂、鍾士得球輕得撥入網内、上半塲乃成二比零之結果、</p>
<p>下半塲再賽、區炳明首先得機射門、但爲勢甚弱、史氏又輕輕救去、何家强縱之射門、亦被救去、華隊此時頗見活動、但五分鐘間、又復低沉下去、被威隊圍攻、連負角球、幸力救得危急間、何佐賢突圍送球前方、何家强撥過李惠堂·李弄過·茂倫把球打入網内、成二比一之局、華隊希望乃增、急攻一陣、但後方又被圍急甚、嚴重之下、卒再被剷入一球、成三比一之局、威爾殊勝、賽畢、由威爾遜夫人頒奬、歡呼而散、茲將雙方陣勢列後、</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>外埠敎部派員視察山東敎育報告</h3>
<p>敎育部前次派員視察山東省敎育之視察報告、前經呈報敎部、該項報告、對於山東敎育應行改進之意見、現由敎部發表如下、</p>
<p>一·敎廳各科處會工作、均爲緊張、近年來對於全省敎育之整理與改造、亦頗著成效、但各縣敎育局一律改爲縣政府第五科後、作事多所牽制、致效率比前减低、殊爲缺憾、應亟設法改進、</p>
<p>二·省立中等學校經常費之用於敎學設備者、均佔百分之四以下、而用於敎職員薪給者、則佔百分之八十以上、此種支配與中學、師範及職業學校規程之規定、不相符合、亟應分别改進、以重功令、</p>
<p>三·各縣所辦師範講習所、凡五十一校、招生資格、畢業年限、及課程敎學等項、諸欠適合、亟應依照師範學校規程、變更組織、提高程度、并充</p>
<p>實内容、以培養各地方目前需要之小學師資、四·省立職業學校停辦多處、現祗四校、所佔中等敎育經費比率、視部定標準、相差甚遠、應卽依照十七年山東全省敎育設計委員會議定設立二十校之計劃、先將首要者十三校、於二十六年度以前、分年設置、並特别注重農業·園藝·水產·陶瓷等科、以適應該省實際之需要、</p>
<p>五·各縣所辦職業學校多係農·蠶·商·及染織等科、職業補習學校課程設備、諸嫌簡陋實習時間過少、尤爲缺點、應由敎廳規劃督飭、以期革新、六·省立中等學校校長、有不兼任敎課者、有任敎課而另支薪給者、此均足以影響整個經費之支配、應卽遵照部定規程辦理、</p>
<p>七·中等學校同年級學生在二班以上者、其分班均以年齡爲標準、無甚意義、應改以能力爲標凖、比較妥適、</p>
<p>八·師範學校畢業學生多不願至鄉村服務、卽較小城鎭敎職、亦不樂就、因此、師範生未服務者所在多有、在國家與個人、實受莫大之損失、應卽依照師範學校規程第九十一條之規定、每届</p>
<p>畢業學生、由敎育行政機關、分配於各地方充任小學或相當學校敎員、並依照第九十條九十三條之規定、嚴格督飭服務、以期符合國家設立師範學校之本旨、</p>
<p>九·中等學校理化生物等課、實騐時間太少、勞作課敎材嫌太空泛、應切實計劃改進、並分别充實各項設備、以利敎學、</p>
<p>十·該省幼穉敎育、根據統計、已有逐漸發展趨勢、惟亟應計劃、充實設備、改進敎學方法、並節省經費、增加班次、俾一般未届學齡之兒童、多得入學之機會、此外、對於兒童之保育、亦應特别注意、</p>
<p>十一·小學敎學方法多欠適當、致秩序紊亂、聲音嘈雜之課室、數見不鮮、複式編制之班級、其功課之排列支配、亦多與敎育原理、不相符合、亟應研究改進、</p>
<p>十二·小學敎職員人數、應酌量减少、校長或主任、應依照規程、擔任敎學、以免多支敎薪、浪費公帑、</p>
<p>十三·天主敎及其他敎會、多視山東爲華北傳敎樂土、敎堂林立、學校隨之廣佈、但多未遵照部章、履行立案手續、應卽嚴行取締、切實整頓、以符標準、</p>
<p>十四·該廳對於社敎人才之訓練、社敎機關之整理、尙能注意、惟社敎經費、自十八年度後、逐年遞减、二十一年度預算、列十七萬三千一百五十五元佔敎費總數百分之五·八五、二十二年度預算、僅列十二萬三千四百四十一元、百分比率更小亟應增籌、以資發展、</p>
<p>十五·各縣社敎經費總數、已達四十二萬餘元、每縣平均爲三千九百五十四元、其所佔全數敎費之百分比、平均爲百分之九·五强、超過百分之十者、凡九十五縣份、經費基礎尙有可觀、惟各縣社敎事業、應再求外延之擴張、與内函之充實、</p>

<p>各同仁之於茲遊也、有蓄志三四年者、有凖備七八年者、今始克踐、然而臨行時、吳修君又以兒病中止、可見遠離家鄉、非易事也、是以四月一日各同仁搭上海丸起程、　友往滙山碼頭者、絡繹不絶、九時、汽笛一聲、報道連行開始、離人心中悵觸萬端、舟離岸漸遠、遙望送别人猶鵠立揚巾揮帽、此時紅錄紙條飛舞江面、與銷魂人之縷縷情絲浮沉愁腸、相互暗然、</p>
<p>舟甫起椗、卽行檢查行李、先令吾人各塡『旅客携帶品申告書』、舉凡箱　物件、僉須一一塡入、吾人以團體、要求免查、不果、惟派人來艙略視、在行李上各貼一紙神戶税關監税部騐訖一紙、較個人遊客、優待多多、</p>
<p>書籍滿二十本以上者、須塡單詳查、植物種子嚴禁携帶、一恐破壞其植物優生、一恐微生虫之攙入登岸也、紙烟每客携帶不得逾百根、並須塡『旅客携帶自用烟草表』表式長方、内容爲船名·</p>
<p>姓名·乘船港名·年月日·年齡·各種烟草名·如紙捲烟草·葉捲烟草·刻烟草·其他等、表塡竣連附香烟往騐、蓋章認可、方得吸用誠不勝其煩厭、旋有友人告吾人云、日本捲烟係國營、設專賣局發售、外客多携捲烟、有損其國家經濟也、途中風平浪靜、天高日麗、吾人出甲板呼吸新空氣、曝太陽紫外綫、三三兩兩、把臂談笑、觀沙鷗之點點、瞻水天之一色、其樂無窮、西望故國、靑山一髮、莫不神往、</p>
<p>水色由黃而綠而黑、風浪稍作、船身不免顚簸、於是暈船者接踵而起、全體伏臥不敢動、晚飯咸未進、如罹大病、惟禱睡神之降臨、以免暈眩嘔吐之痛苦、</p>
<h3>長崎之一瞥</h3>
<p>舟行十四小時、長崎在望、日本時鐘較吾國快一小時、四月二日十二時一刻（卽吾國十一時一刻）安抵長崎、長崎港係天賦之良好軍港、形若凹字、羣山蜿蜒、滿目蒼翠、諸山如吾國之普陀山及莫干山、玲瓏秀雅、引人入勝　、</p>
<p>長崎古英雄名、遂以人名名地、元龜二年開港、明治前、日本國外貿易港首屈一指今以大阪神戶諸港、次第興建、長崎乃今不如昔、市面蕭條、路政失修、其現象與吳淞相彷彿、惟交通多電車汽車耳、</p>
<p>舟抛錨、日本新聞記者絡繹而至、吾人僅推定一人說話、所以防發表之不一致也、俄爾市長草間秀雄派學務課長福岡道藏等來埠迎迓、吾人相率登岸、記者携一照相機、因上岸無自由攝影權致英雄無用武之地、香烟僅允身藏二十枝、復經海關騐訖、方准入境、</p>
<h3>博會之遊覽</h3>
<p>國際產業觀光博覽會、第一會塲設在長崎市中之島埋立地、第二會塲在雲仙國立公園、展覽時期自三月二十五日至五月二十三日、共六十日、由該市商辦、政府襄助厥成、其目的無非在展示國内外之物產、吸引外客觀光、券資成人三角、兒童及軍人减半、團體依人數分别減價、兒童在三十人以上者每人祗納五分、吾人以市政府之招、免費入塲、</p>
<p>吾人以時侷促僅遊覽第一會塲、塲中設、（一）文明祥館、（二）外國館、（三）觀光館、（四）海事水產館、（五）機械館、（六）社會保健館、（七）臺灣館、（八）北海道館、（九）日光館、（十）海女館、（十一）產業本館、（十二）產業貿易館、（十三）國防館、（十四）發明館、（十五）敎育館、（十）</p>
<p>（六）長崎館、（十七）朝鮮館、（十八）滿洲館、（十九）演藝館、（二十）迎賓館、（二十一）其他特設館、此外尙有接待所、兒童遊園等、館屋皆臨時建築、預算爲五十萬金、大體觀察、遜於吾國昔年西湖博覽會、此不足怪、蓋彼不過一市之人力財力耳、</p>
<p>遍訪各館、感想萬千、最足令人劌心怵目者爲滿洲館、吾人不忍入覽、但見依門一女、服旗袍、手持印刷品招待遊人、日本旗及僞國旗臨風招展、見者益增㣼怛、</p>
<p>國防館有現代戰各種器、上海事變史蹟、滿洲事變日軍戰鬥經過要領及交通狀况、毒瓦斯之應用與預防、防寒服裝及戰事無備之人民田宅受災慘狀、都市防空一部、用電力表示、頗惹人注意、初示敵國飛空龔、繼以發聲警報、隨後敵軍侵襲、終則敵機退却、有聲有色、發人警惕、又有世界軍備及兵士比較、美艦之大、日艦表示相形見拙、中國兵數二百萬、爲全世界首、但弱而無能、表示易欺、此種心理、深入日人、何異注射無數之嗎啡針、國人乎、而今猶其夢未醒乎、觀光館大多誇耀日本諸名勝、内置『昭和七年度本邦内外人消費額』圖表一大幅、統計外人在日遊覽耗費用、合計爲四千三百十一萬三千金、其中土產品一千金、商品三百萬金、享樂一千萬金、汽車一百萬金、膳宿五百十萬、鐵道運　一百三十萬金、市内汽車一百萬金、飲食館一千萬金、雜費一百七十八萬三千萬金、另有一表指示吾人去年外人遊日者吾國人達七千七百九十三人、美國四千三百十人、英國三千五百二十五人、法國四百七十八人、俄國一千零六十六人、德國七百二十一人、其他國籍者三千零六十八人、此中吾國人最多、而消費於彼邦亦最鉅、然年來國人赴日者較諸昭和二年時已鋭减三分之一矣、日本現設國際觀光局、專事招徠外客、吸收現金、西洋各國亦有此項類似之組織、吾國地大、風景殊多、曷不奮臂而起思有所組織也、</p>
<p>是日會日本學校放春假、假期小學自四月一日至五日、中學則一日至三日、故未有作何種學校之參觀、好在留陸時間匆促、下午五時、舟卽駕駛、直向神戶而往、</p>

<h3>桂敎廳長雷賓南談國民基礎敎育之設施　厲行强迫敎育　確定基礎方案　普及義務實施　完成五年計畫</h3>
<p>廣西省敎育廳長雷沛鴻氏、上月因料理私事告假來滬、昨日雷氏語記者、以該省普及國民基礎敎育之設施及桂省敎育現狀頗詳、亟爲分誌於后、</p>
<h3>敎育現狀</h3>
<p>雷氏首謂該省現有高中初等學校（包括省·縣·市·私·區·鄉立）綜計一二·六九一校、男女學生五六七·二○六人、敎職員二七·二九六人曁其他社會敎育機關、全年敎育經費支出總額爲一五·七七八·五四九元、佔全省收入百分之三十、受敎與未受敎者其比率受敎者佔百分之五十强、平均該省每一千人中有一·九個靑年得受中等敎育五○·七個兒童、得受初等敎育每一人民每年平均擔負高等敎育經費二分四釐、中等敎育經費一角九分九釐、初等敎育經費四角○七釐、社會敎育經費三分八釐、合計六角六分八釐、</p>
<h3>基礎設施</h3>
<p>據云、桂省敎育政策、係依照該省施政方針而實施、過去因忽略基礎致進步遲緩、故去年九月省府委員會議時卽通過『廣西普及國民基礎敎育五年計劃大綱』、决議以政治及經濟社會等力量爲主輔、限五年内普及國民基礎敎育于全省、繼以國民基礎敎育之力量、促成本省政治經濟文化社會等建設、根據上項决議、故確定三個敎育法案、（一）廣西普及國民基礎敎育五年計劃、（二）廣西國民基礎敎育研究院開辦計劃、（三）廣西普及國民基礎敎育試辦區規程復根、據上述法案規定、全力推進以期其成、内容約略如下、</p>
<p>方法（一）實行勞作合一（二）使能生產自給以恊助該省與中央政府分工合作、</p>
<p>工作分義務與民衆敎育兩種義務敎育、卽六歲起至十二歲以下、每人須强迫受基礎義務敎育二年、十二歲起至十六歲以下之失學兒童、須强迫補受義務敎育一年、民衆敎育爲健全民團組織促成地方自治推合作運動、</p>
<p>程序（一）學術研究設立廣西普及國民基礎敎育研究院、（二）試騐全省六道區中各選一縣爲普及國民基礎敎育試辦區（三）推廣除試辦區外其餘各縣、均此普及國民基礎敎育推廣區分三期、進行每期推廣三分之一、</p>
<p>完成（一）自二十二年十一月從組織成立廣西普及國民基礎敎育研究院起、（二）二十三年二至七月籌備試辦區同年八月開辦二十五年七月完成、（三）二十四年二月起籌備推廣區二十六年七月第一期完成、（四）二十四年二月起至二十七年七月第二期推廣完成、（五）二十六年二月起至二十八年七月第三期推廣完成、</p>
<p>末據雷氏云、敎育不普及、實爲吾國人最大缺點、社會一切混亂騷擾、皆因此致成如此五年計劃、不受政局影響實有完成可能性、桂省地極貧瘠、建設上不免因陋就簡、最近輿論一般皆謂桂省如何好如何進步、實際尙不能謂好、惟工作人員皆能勵精圖治、其精神較爲可佩而已、余因須赴北方參觀水利工程農村信用合作、故返桂之期須在本月底云、</p>

<h3>我國地租標凖化之問題</h3>
<p>— 陳鴻根</p>
<p>地租就是佃農對於地主因使用土地（如里加圖之所謂原始的與不可毁滅的地方）而納付的一種報酬，他的數額是依地力的肥瘠而變動的。假使我們要測度地租之是否合理，換言之，卽是地主的收入是否爲正當，普通都是用地價的百分之十作爲標凖，來和實際的租額比較。按我國現時尙無法定的租率，這固然部分的是由於各處地力不等的原故，但是地主要挾或任定租額的事常會發現，同時佃戶矇蔽地主降低租率的事也往往有之。地租若過高，則佃戶除納租外所餘無多，或竟至於凍餒。反之地租若過低，則地主必蒙其投資之損失，所以應當</p>
<p>有一個公平的標凖率，使雙方的利害能達於平衡的狀態。</p>
<p>（一）納租制之類别</p>
<p>（甲）納租金制—卽規定佃戶每年納若干現金（以一畝爲單位）於地主，此制多行於土質較肥。雨量均匀，生產較豐，工商業繁盛之區，如江蘇·福建·湖北·湖南·廣東·等省。</p>
<p>（乙）納租榖制—佃農在此制下納定額的糧食於地主，在租約中有明文規定如言：『每年春秋兩季納交乾潔好米○斗○升』我國北方及中部產米之區多採此制，納榖之種類依其地之生產物而定，如浙東各縣納租稻，西部各縣納租米。</p>
<p>（丙）分租制—Ａ普通分租制－由佃業雙方訂明分租成數，然後按照此比例分劃每年之收穫，所訂之成數，各地因地力之差異及地主供給物之多寡而互異。如河南·山西·江蘇之靖江·南通·廣東·湖南·等處爲佃六地四·江蘇之江寗·海門·六合·淮安·鹽城·湖南·廣東·等處爲佃業各半；其他亦有地七佃三者如靖江·如　·亦有地三佃七者如句容·綜錯紛雜·絶不一致。Ｂ　分　—田佃戶於每届農估物成熟之時，　請地主下鄉察勘，臨時雙方議訂分　比例，如河南之光山，江蘇之靖江縣是。Ｃ幫工佃種制－亦屬分租制之一種，但是因爲多行於地力貧瘠之地，如山西之五台縣，佃戶只出勞力，其他如種子，肥料·房屋·水車等皆由地主供給，所以佃戶所得的分租成數非常之低。</p>
<p>（二）現時地租與標凖租率的比較</p>
<p>（甲）立法院一九三○年之統計，各省旱田及水田之錢租租率如下：</p>
<p>省名上田中田下田</p>
<p>水田旱田水田旱田水田旱田</p>
<p>吉林二·八一五·０一０·八一八·八一一·九二０·五</p>
<p>遼寗二０·三七·０一六·一七·０一五·八一五·三</p>
<p>察哈爾九·三一０·０九·三一一·四一三·五一五·三</p>
<p>山西一二·九一二·０一四·八一五·七一六·０一八·五</p>
<p>河北九·四一一·０一二·二一一·０一一·二一五·二</p>
<p>山東九·六一二·九九·二一四·六九·０一五·五</p>
<p>江蘇六·三八·五七·六一　·三七·０九·三</p>
<p>安徽……八·七……一二·五一三·０</p>
<p>河南九·六九·五九·八一０一一二·　一二·四</p>
<p>湖北一一·三一三·八一九·四</p>
<p>四川一六·八七·六一四·八七·八一四·六六·五</p>
<p>湖南一二·０一二·五一三·五</p>
<p>江西一五·五一二·二一八·七一五·三一八·三一０·九</p>
<p>浙江一四·０一五·０一六·０</p>
<p>平均一一·二一０·０一二·五一二·五·一三·五一四·０</p>
<p>旱田—上等田之租率平均爲一○·％，其差異由遼寗省之七％，達於吉林省之一五％，中等田亦以遼寗省最低；平均各省爲一二·五％，下等田以四川（六·五％）江蘇（九·三％）等省爲低，平均爲一四·○％。水田—水田中之差異較大。如上田中吉林爲二○·三％，江蘇爲六·三％，相差三倍而有餘。中田以江西爲最高，（一八·七％）遼寗·山西·四川諸省次之。下等田平均爲一三·五％，其中之差異，由湖北之一九·四％至江蘇之七·○％。</p>
<p>（乙）金大農業經濟系之調查—據金大農業經濟系調查五省九處五○一農家之租率所得的結果如下：</p>
<p>省縣每畝田租較標凖租額應增或減之數每畝之每畝租額較標凖租標凖租應增額或减之％</p>
<p>中國北部元元元元</p>
<p>安徽宿縣一·七三０·０三一·七六一·一</p>
<p>山西五台二·八七－０·八一二·０六－二八·二</p>
<p>中國中東部</p>
<p>安徽來安一九二一四·八六－一·二九三·五七－二六·五</p>
<p>來安一九二二二·二六－０·六二一·六四－二七·四</p>
<p>浙江鎭海四·六四－一·二０三·四四－二五·九</p>
<p>福建連江一二·五０－三·０七九·四三·二四·六</p>
<p>江蘇江寗三·九四一·五七五·五一三九·八</p>
<p>江寗（Ｓ）二·０三－０·七六一·二七－三七·四</p>
<p>武進（Ｔ）四·九四－一·０七三·八七－二一·七</p>
<p>平均四·四三－０·九八三·四五－二二·一</p>
<p>（註）表中有－者係表明大於標凖租額而應减去之數，無－者爲小於標凖租應增之數。</p>
<p>表中的租額是用錢數來表明的最高要算連江縣，每畝須納租一二·五元，而宿縣每畝僅納</p>
<p>一·七元，平均各處每畝納四·四三元，若拿來與地價的百分之十比較、則除江寗縣淳化鎭</p>
<p>及宿縣二處外，餘皆超過標凖，如連江每畝超過三·○七元，來安一·二九元，武進一·○七元等。平均各地超過○·九八元。依標凖公平之租額平均各處應减去原租額二二·一％卽每畝只納三·四五元·至於各處應增或减去之實數與百分率互不一致，詳見表中。</p>
<p>（丙）江蘇省農業調查錄亦有關於租率的統計</p>
<p>現在把他列表如下。</p>
<p>田地等級地價租金額租率</p>
<p>下等地（高地）三七·０三元二·九九元八·一％</p>
<p>上等地（中常地）五０·九三三·八二七·五</p>
<p>中等地（低地）三四·五一三·０二八·八</p>
<p>亦可以證明蘇省的錢租多半未超過標凖，與立法院的統計結果大致吻合。</p>
<p>（丁）喬啓明氏曾就崑山南通及宿縣調查佃農之租率，所得结果如下：（見農田制度之比較以及改良農佃問題之建議第五章三二頁）</p>
<p>地點崑山南通宿縣</p>

<p>糧食分租法一０·三一一·三一０·０九·０一二·五一五·０</p>
<p>在納租金制項下三處皆較標凖租率爲小，尤其是南通，不及標凖租率的一半，在納榖制下除南通之下等地與宿縣之上等地外，餘皆超過地價百分之十，至於糧食分租法之租率則差異更大，宿縣的下等田高至一五％</p>
<p>浙西八村錢租租率比較</p>
<p>（戊）浙江省－據立法院統計（見統計月報二卷六號三○－三二頁）之二十一縣二十一村水田錢租租率上中下三等田地爲九·三％，九，二％與一一·五％又據浙西二十縣八五村之調查，其中有數村之租率如下：－</p>

<p>第一表中各村之錢租租率平均上等田爲八·</p>
<p>八％中等田爲九·一％下等田爲一一·九·與標凖的租率總很近似。</p>
<p>第二表中是將每畝榖租折成現價再來和標凖租率比較，其中上等田的租率及九·六％，中等田是一一·一％下等田是一四·一，％與標凖率的差異比錢租大得多。</p>
<p>（三）各種租制與標凖率之關係</p>
<p>（甲）租金制－在租金制之下，各地租率多在一○％左右，卽有差異，亦屬甚小，如南通宿縣無論上中下等地都未超過地價百分之下，浙江省之上中等水田租率亦是同樣的情形，立法院之統計有數省差異較大，然與其他租制比較猶爲不及。</p>
<p>（乙）租榖制－此制下的租率往往超過標準如崑山之上中下在等地，及南通之上中等地，與宿縣之下等地，皆多於地價的一％。再如浙西之八村除上等中之一部分外，餘皆超過標準率高者達二○％以上（如於潛縣之藻溪鎭，豐孝縣之扇村等。）</p>
<p>（丙）分租制－分租制之租率與標準率的差異，據喬啓明氏統計，比其他二者都大，如宿縣之下等地爲一五％，中等地一二·五％，未及一○％者，僅上等地而已。</p>
<p>（四）田地等級與租率之關係</p>
<p>從上列諸表中不難發現一重要之關係，就是田地等級愈下的，他的租率多較上等的田地爲高，確是成功一個反比例。</p>
<p>（甲）租金制－就立法院的統計説，吉林省旱田租率上等田爲一五·○％，中等田爲一八·八％，下等田爲二○，五％，其他各省的統計也有同樣的趨勢。</p>
<p>（丙）租榖制－顯示着與租金制同樣的情形，譬如昌化縣之雲老村上等田租率不及下等　田之半，僅有少數的地方呈現例外，如南通田地的租率是和他的等級一同降跌的。</p>
<p>（丙）分租制－分租制下租率與田地等級的關係頗不確定，如南通之下等地租率較上等地爲小，而宿縣則反之，立法院亦有統計分租制租率之變遷，結果與南通略同，茲不　述。</p>
<p>考田地愈劣而租率愈高之原因，不外次等的田地，多爲佃戶所租種。及人口漸繁，競爭者必多，地租就隨著高起來，同時地主對於次等田地的估價往往失之公平，也足以爲租率高漲的原因。</p>
<p>（五）地租超過標凖之影響與救濟</p>
<p>經過以上的分析，可知我國的地租大半超過標凖以上，所生的影響最大的有：（甲）佃農生活程度之降低；佃農處於這樣狀態之下，收入極微，每成年男子一年的消費額，不過五十元左右，連最簡單的衣食問題都難以解决，誠如董仲舒之所謂『邑有人君之尊，里有公侯之富，或耕豪民之田見税十五，故貧民常衣牛馬之衣，而食犬彘之食。（乙）剝奪佃農改進之機會；農佃僅是農業階梯中（ＡｇｒｉｃｕｌｔｕｒｅＬａｄｄｅｒ）的一個階段，靑年的農人因缺乏資本與經騐，自以租種他人田地爲宜。以後他總希望可以集些餘欵來購置一塊土地，成爲自耕農。不過在現在個農生活維艱的狀况下，來談改進，實在是過於渺茫。（丙）社會貧富階級之縣殊；佃農一部分之利益，旣爲地主所攫去，則貧者將愈貧，富者日以富，挺而走險，淪爲盜匪者，往往有之。</p>
<p>補救的方法，當然是削平地租，不過實行起來很不容易。第一，必須精密的調查地價，作爲决定標凖租額的基礎。第二，各地的情形過於複雜，必得詳爲參照，分别規定。第三，各地的地主，爲保護利益計，當起而反對，所以我想，這樣綦艱的工作，只有等我們公正的當局者去用政治力量實現了。－一，二十六日於南京。</p>
<h3>綏德縣四村的土地關係</h3>
<p>— 勾適生</p>
<p>一，緒言</p>
<p>綏德縣在陜西省底北部，是一片多山的地方。有無定河和大理河穿過，不但不能灌漑，而且常泛濫成災。農民在山坡上耕地，那呌作山地。山地傾斜，有時斜到四十五度，旣不容易耕作，又不能聚水。天一旱，沒有一點辦法。兩山之間的平地較山地好些，呌作川地，收穫地較多；但是川地面積同山地面積一比，那可是小極了。川地上若有井水可澆，那就成了水地了；水地所種的差不多全是牙片。</p>
<p>同陜西底中部不同，這里的土地所有權是集中的，同時大部分農民沒有土地或有非常少的土地。土地一小部分集中在本縣的地主底手裏；大部分是集中在鄰縣的地主底手裏，尤其是米脂縣楊家溝村馬姓一族。土地所有和土地使用很顯著地分離開了。各村裏的貧苦的農民和土著的中小地主多多少少也是對立着的，但是他們底遭遇是同樣地不幸···土地所有權都只是减少而不見增加。</p>
<p>幾年來的災荒，給綏德的農民的影響，雖然不及鳳翔武功那麽人吃人的厲害，但是苛捐雜税都未輕饒了他們。比例來看，越貧苦的農民，負担是越重；地主仗勢力，可以少出税，甚至不出税。貧苦的農民越發貧苦了。</p>
<p>現在要討論的是綏德的四個村了，崖馬溝，雷家溝，劉郭川，和鵝峁峪。這是四個適中的村子，可以代表一般的情形。</p>
<p>山地和川地底單位都是垧，約等於三畝；水地底單位是畝。爲着討論的方便，現在依照產量和面積，把川地和水地也折合成山地。山地每垧底產量約等於普通旱地一畝底產量。</p>
<p>二，土地所有權底减少</p>
<p>一九二八年未發生災荒時，四個村子底土地所有權是二○七九，○垧；一九三三年减少到一六一六，四垧，减少了四六二，六垧，佔一九二八年的二二，二五％，無論是一九二八年的地主，富農；中農，或貧農，土地所有權都减少了，貧農减少得更快。結果是，到一九三三年，地主由五戶减少到四戶，富農仍是九戶，中農由四十一戶减少到三十一戶，貧農由一百九十七戶增加到二百十七戶，不從事耕作的由十三戶减到十一戶。一九二八年共計二百六十五戶，一九三三年共計二百七十二戶，增加了七戶；這七戶是由分家而增加的。</p>
<p>一九二八年貧農一百九十七戶裏，有八十九戶是佃農，六十一戶是僱農，四十七戶是自耕農。一九三三年貧農二百十七戶裏，有一百二十二戶是個農，四十七戶是僱農，四十八戶是自耕農。佃農增加是這樣地快。</p>
<p>土地所有權底减少是經過這樣三步程序。第一；因收成不足或爲應付捐税而向地主借貸；借貸必用土地爲抵押品，很少有例外。地主債權者，尤其是米脂楊家溝馬姓的三元堂等，不但擁有廣大的土地，而且還在市鎭上，例如雙湖峪鎭，開設商店；接洽借貸常常是在這樣的商店裏。第二，債欵若到期不還，抵押地就變成典地，以所得典價來付債欵本利。第三，典地若到期不贖，就變賣給地主，以所得賣價來付典價，或許還略有剩餘。（關於借貸，請參閲拙著陜西綏德縣鵝峁峪村的借貸一文，新中華二卷五期，頁七十五）。</p>
<p>五年來所减少的四六二，六垧土地，大部分是典出的，小部分是賣出的。買進一七，三垧；典進四七，○垧；賣出九四，五垧；典出四三二，四垧。典賣垧數對所有垧數的比率，以一九二八年的貧農爲最高，是三○，○七％，其次是中農。</p>
<p>富農，中農，和貧農都有土地押出。一九二八年押出垧數對所有垧數的比率是二八，六一％；一九三三年是一七，四八％。這樣就全體來看，情形似乎好些了；但是就那佔最大成分的貧農來看，情形就壞了；一九二八年是三○，一九％；一九三三年是五八，二一％貧農底半數以上的土地都押出去了。</p>
<p>三，土地底分配和使用</p>
<p>就戶數來看，地主每戶有地六八，三五垧；富農，四一，○六垧；中農，一四，八一垧；貧農，二，三七垧。貧農每戶平均所有垧數不及地主底二十八分之一。貧農裏沒有土地的有一百二十四戶，佔貧農全體二百十七戶底五七，一四％。貧農有地在四垧以下的佔七七，四二％。四垧土地哪里能够維持一家生活呢！</p>
<p>更何况不到四垧！</p>
<p>因爲消費者是以個人計算的，又因爲地主，富農，中農，和貧農底每戶平均人數不同，所以我們要單獨看各類村戶每人平均所有垧數。</p>
<p>地主每戶平均人數是七，○○；富農是七·六七：中農是六，四五；貧農是五·六三。地主每人平均所有是九，七六垧；富農，五·三六垧；中農，二，三○垧；貧農，○，四二垧。貧農每人所有垧數不及地主底二十三分之一。中農每人平均所有是二，三○垧；這是説，要維持一個最低限度的生活，每個人至少要有二，三○垧地。貧農每人平均所有是○·四二，不到最低限度底五分之一。若是把所有的土地都平均分配給每個人，連現在不從事耕作的人也算在裏面，每人可以分得一·○四垧地，還不到最低限度底一半呢。土地所有權集中在土著地主底手裏，又加上土地所有權落在外人底手裏！這加深了大多數農民底窮若。各類村戶每人平均所有土地底絶對平均差（ＭｅａｎＤｉｖｉ</p>
<p>ｉａｔｉｏｎ）是三·一○垧，相對平均差是一一○·一八％。鳳翔縣的絶對平均差不過是一·四六畝；相對平雹差是六一·二一％。</p>
<p>綏德四村每人所有土地平均差，（一九三三）</p>
<p>村戶每人平均所有　離差</p>
<p>地主九·七六五·三○</p>
<p>富農五·三六○·九○</p>
<p>中農三·三○二·一六</p>
<p>貧農○·四二四·○四</p>
<p>絶對平均四·四六三·一○</p>
<p>相對平均一一○·一八井</p>
<p>米單位垧井％</p>
<p>使用的土地比所有的土地多了將及一倍·前者是後者底一八七·四二％分開來看·中農和貧農使用的土地比所有的多；地主和富農就不是這樣。地主底土地租出了五五·○一％；富農底土地租出了一一·三七％，但是使用的土地有一·二一％是租進來的；中農底使用的土地有二一·三一％是租進來的；貧農底土地租出了二·一四％，但是使用的土地有七四·七二％是租進來的。</p>
<p>貧農是這樣地需要土地。</p>

<p>吳氏又曰。『春溫，夏熱，秋凉，冬寒。乃四時之常。因風雨陰晴。稍爲損益。假令春應暖而反多寒者。其時必多雨。秋應凉而熱不去者。此際必多晴。夫陰晴寒潦之不測。寒暑損益。安可以爲拘。此天地四時之常事。未必爲疫。夫疫者。感天地之戾氣也。戾氣者。非寒非暑非暖非凉。亦非四時交錯之氣。乃天地别有一種戾氣。多見於兵凶之歲。間歲亦有之。但不甚耳。』此吳氏攻擊非其時而有其氣。爲時行之氣之説也。</p>
<p>吳氏又曰。『蓋緣不知戾氣爲疫。然又知非寒暑之氣應時而感。只得以四時交錯之氣爲疫。殊不知四時之氣。雖損益於其間。及其所感之病。終不離其本源。』吳氏之意。以爲著陰陽大論者。對於時行之來。旣知非應時之寒暑所能生成。因不知别有戾氣之故。只得歸咎於春反大寒。夏反大凉。秋反大熱。冬反大溫等四時交錯之氣。以爲時行發生之原。殊不知雖有交錯乖候之氣。亦不過寒暑之損益而已。縱能爲病。亦只是本氣之病。無釀成時疫之理也。吳氏直認寒熱溫凉本氣爲病。無論交錯到如何程度。乖候到如何程度。損益到如何程度。亦只是本氣之病。不能離其本源。决無變爲時疫之理。此種思想。眞能得科學之精神者也。與西土主張微生物必由微生物而生。决非自無而變爲有之説。異曲同工。其頭腦淸晰。其思想透闢。其主旨堅决。其手段斬截。眞我國醫界千古一人也。必如是。始能解决糾紛。刋落虚僞。撥雲霧而見靑天也。惜乎繼起無人。遂成絶調。吾於以歎吾國醫界。皆庸妄之輩。熙攘往來者。皆行尸走肉者也。可哀也夫。</p>
<p>要而言之。吳氏旣以溫熱病爲疫。又反對中而不卽發伏藏爲病之説。復反對四時交錯之氣。變爲時行之説。於時獨創别有戾氣之論。以打破古來六氣爲病之範圍。非見之確。思之精。不泥古。不阿世。直舒所見。實事求是者。誰能如此。惜乎當時病原細菌之學。尚未發達。戾氣之説。無實物以證之耳。不然。其功豈讓德之郭霍法之巴士特哉。</p>
<p>吳氏旣否認四時交錯之氣能釀成溫疫。然猶以爲四時本氣確能致病。故以爲傷寒之病。確是傷於風寒所致。認爲是四時本氣所生之病。非戾氣之崇。故置之溫疫之外也。其實寒熱溫凉四時之氣。决不能爲熱病之原。今之所謂感冒風寒者。仍是病源細菌爲之主人。曰風曰寒。誘因而已耳。媒介之事而已耳。是故以今日科學之醫學觀之。仲景之傷寒。亦時行也。亦傳染病也。觀其自序。謂『宗族素多。向餘二百。建安紀年以來。猶未十稔。其死亡者。三分有二。傷寒十居其七。』此豈非長幼之病。多相似哉。謂非時行之氣乎。特不在一歲之中而已耳。故吾謂仲景傷寒論。亦卽傳染病論也。與吳氏之所謂溫疫。同爲病原細菌之崇。而陰陽大論之所分辦。小品之所區别。吳氏之所界劃。皆不得其眞相也。不若素間以熱病屬傷寒之類。難經以傷寒總五病之名。肘後合雅俗爲一。姚張統寒溫爲治。爲能得其要領。觀其會通也。</p>
<h3>在華外籍醫師之質的分析</h3>
<p>— 郭培靑</p>
<p>外籍醫師之在我國業者，以國内各大都市爲最多，至内地各處之有外籍醫師行醫者，則僅少數依賴敎會醫院，以爲行醫之處所，惟彼等在國内人數雖屬不多，然爲國人執迷崇外的心理之故，執業方面，尙不感到有如何之障碍，甚者且頗受一般羣衆之歡迎，此種現象，固爲國人崇外心理之所致，然於事實方面，反多予國人以物質之損失，甚者被其枉害或甘爲試騐品而不自知，此誠吾人引爲無上之遺憾者也。</p>
<p>考外籍醫師上流入我國，始於有淸之末葉，距今約有五六十年之歷史，是時海禁大開，外人依據條約深入我國内地傳敎，但能毫無阻碍而受人歡迎者則甚少，因之彼等爲表示博愛及施惠起見，恒於敎會所在地附近，特設醫院，爲貧苦人民免費醫療，日久漸得人民之推戴與歡迎，然其目的，初不在於醫療事業，而仍以傳敎爲中心也。</p>
<p>外籍醫師旣以傳敎爲目的而次第來華，其進行步驟，始則予人慈惠，以博取一般人民之擁戴，而達其宗敎麻醉之目的，繼則以我國人民愚味可欺，凡遇疑難疾病，不以愼重出之，動輒冒險嘗試，以我國人民供其醫學上之試騐品，（然斯時國外新醫學亦無今日之發達），近十餘年來，國人崇尙外籍醫師日衆，因之涉重洋到我國者，人數突增，此輩外籍醫師，具有高深學術，豐富經騐者，固大有人在，然而利用國人崇外心理，實行經濟侵略、及不學無術，專作江湖之勾當者，又在在皆是·茲將在華外籍醫師之實質，條晰如次：</p>
<p>（一）以傳敎爲目的者以傳敎爲目的之外籍醫師，其本身必爲基督徒無疑，此輩人員頗能忍苦耐勞，且富有慈愛之觀念，彼等多散處我國内地，以敎會醫院爲根據地，各大都市則較少見，是等外籍醫師出身學校，多爲各該國省立或私立醫校畢業者，畢業後志願爲敎會服務，先在本國敎會總機關登記，由該會指定到某國某地服務，至其待遇之優薄，多以其服務年數或家庭負擔爲標凖。</p>
<p>（二）以撈利爲目的者此輩醫師，幾麕集於我國各大都市，利用國人拜外心理，聯絡各洋行買辦，作彼等之介紹人，診金奇昻，架子十足，終日營營逐逐，進出於各名人富賈之門，旣無慈惠之觀念，更乏廉恥之行爲，凡足以達撈獲金錢之目的者，卽使欺騙奸詐，莫不可爲，故此輩輒係私人開業，鮮有在醫院服務者，與我國江湖醫生，無甚差别。</p>
<p>（三）以研究爲目的者外籍醫師之在我國，恒有以研究東方病之目的而來華者，此輩醫師，或在醫院服務，或係私人開業，學問經騐，多有相當根底，抵華之後，常厠於名醫之列·彼輩旣以研究學問爲目的，故對普通病症，置諸不問，遇有疑難或罕見之疾患，每不惜通宵達旦，潛心研究，以病人爲研究材料，對患者作研究工具，但此輩外籍醫師，在華人數較少，都市内地，皆有彼等之足跡。</p>
<p>（四）以謀生爲目的者以謀生爲目的之外籍醫師，近年來由各國來華者日見增多，是輩董師，多乏相當之資格，或係外國醫院護士，或係醫學敎授助手，在國内旣無人信仰，同時又乏噉飯之餘地，因而不得不東渡中華，藉開業爲謀生手段，其性質初與以撈利爲目的者無甚軒輊，亦卽外籍江湖醫師之一種。</p>
<p>（五）以服役爲目的者在華外籍醫師，其能以服役爲目的者，甚屬少見，但亦不能武斷其爲絶無，各醫學校敎授，間有此輩醫師之存在，然爲數極少，觀此則可知在華外籍醫師之内幕，願我國人切實打破拜外之心理，而知有所警惕乃可。</p>
<h3>煤油療肺討論</h3>
<p>自本報春秋欄發表日本『婦女之友』雜誌煤油療肺一問題後。國中人士注意者極多。惟本刋以醫藥學的立塲未敢輕於發言。後應讀者要求。曾刋載丁惠康先生譯文。汪企張楊郁生先生討論文字。茲於今日復刋龐京周張致果丁惠康先生三文。總觀諸先生大作。其結論均謂煤油療肺尙在研究時期。民衆不可妄以嘗試。謹以此論。作爲結束。此後不再發刋其他同樣文字。（編者）</p>
<h3>煤油潮</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>自從日本婦女雜誌－主婦之友登載煤油療肺。又經我國日報譯錄以來。一方面引起許多患者的希望與驚疑。他方面引起醫界的注意與討論。擾攘紛呶。煞是熱閙。我無以名之。祇好名之曰『煤油潮』。</p>
<p>本人忝居醫林。自不免被此亂潮所冲盪。最近接到親朋病家的電話函件。面詢口信。一日必有數起。弄得復不勝復。因知潮勢着實不在小處。</p>
<p>細想煤油療肺一語的所以釀成這樣潮勢。無非是人們有三個重大心理。</p>
<p>第一是國人的『單方迷』。大凡患病的人。不論中外。誰不想抄近路。求速愈。最好求一味極簡單的藥。或是極簡單的方法。來解除痼疾。世界上人同此心。心同此理。卽如外國醫學。無論怎樣發達。病家還是嫌他太麻煩。因此草頭土法。依舊不能絶跡。而我國更有一句俗語。呌作『單方一味氣殺名醫』。差不多患性病而久經醫治無效的人。無日不想求一味單方來氣殺曾經替他治過病的醫家。所以可謂中國人信仰單方。另有專癖。煤油旣然是家喻戶曉。人人可致的簡單日常用品。如何不引起國人的單方狂呢。而况名醫偏又利用單方在那裏説話。於是煤油潮格外的得勢了。</p>
<p>第二是患者『希望熱』。肺病的患者這樣多。肺病的醫治代價這樣貴。肺病的病症這樣頑固。誰不想打出一條捷徑來解除這惡疾。因爲希望靈藥過於熱烈。所以拾着鷄毛當令箭。聽見煤油作仙丹。這無非人之常情罷了。</p>
<p>第三是國人的『拜外心』。近來民間傳説治肺病的單方。其實也不止一種。例如前幾年有人盛説蓴菜補肺。白芨愈癆。然而都沒有煤油那樣熱閙。不久漸趨於沉寂。而此次煤油偏閙得最兇。實在因爲煤油消息。從日本傳來。煤油文字得之於日本雜誌。也不問他外國什麽雜誌了。並且煤油不是國貨。尤其看得</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>神秘。俗稱喚作洋油。多少帶些洋氣。意志薄弱。莫此爲甚。假如有人在外國報紙上登道『草紙含有維他命。Ｖｉｔａｍｉｎ内服可治脚氣病』。恐怕也有人大吃草紙呢。</p>
<p>此次煤油潮中。有除却各日報的醫刋裏紛紛登載辯論。卽就是各小報也都有些記載。前幾日晶報上就有一篇文字提着煤油療肺而表示驚奇的口吻。接着却就有一個具名『内行』二字的投稿。加以解説這位内行先生的論調。頗是直截痛快。如今再把他照錄在左方。</p>
<p>（一）凡近世醫學上稱發明者。必須有確實之學理根據。或則有多數之實例統計。</p>
<p>（二）至於在發明者。研究某種治法之前。自必先有一種動機。而此項動機。自必係一種偶然的發見。（卽如收效於一日人或一女字云。）然發見不能卽謂之發明。</p>
<p>（三）煤油治肺。據各文所述。恐尙在發見之後。正宜研究之中。而尙未至發明之時期。</p>
<p>（四）不論何種科學專門人員。在發見某種事實。而在進行研究中。似不應卽以之號於社衆。而稱之曰發明發明。醫學非他種學科可比。更應審愼周詳。然後提出討論。</p>
<p>（五）專門家在討論期内。不是在供</p>
<p>獻期内。卽無須宣傳。更無宣傳於社會之必要。故日報上討論一種最新的嘗試醫藥。已經失却民衆讀物的本色。</p>
<p>（六）煤油治肺結核問題。競載中外各雜誌報章以後。引起民衆許多擾攘。實誤於『發而不明。』『輕事重報』等文字。所以晶報謂其閙得烟霧騰天也。</p>
<p>（七）醫無派别。學無止境。循途以進。則造福社會。生死人而肉白骨。若標新炫異急欲以初萌之學題（學理上足資研究之一問題）作業務之工具。吾輒期期以爲不可也。</p>
<p>但此外覺得還要補充的。－凡是要確定一種藥物治病的實效。當然先要確定病症的診斷。照日本東京市外市立療養所的報告。他那裏已經確定爲肺結核的六十三個患者用煤油療法。都不佳妙。反有流弊。而主婦之友雜誌上所載和中國最近嘗試的患者。偏又稱『食慾大振。精神健旺』。兩相比較。似乎相去太遠。我如今且不疑心報告者説謊。但我却疑心得煤油微效的。或者竟不是眞正肺結核患者。何以呢？記者從前德國某敎授施行一種心理療法。是將極毒的毒藥。用極小的小量。（不致毒量）例如用昇汞置在一杯淸水裏給神經過敏的人治牙痛。居然很有效。那麽也許有不少自己疑懼患結核的神經衰弱者。竟因飲少</p>
<p>許煤油而得到安慰。－鎭靜。也未可知。</p>
<p>然而最後我仍要説煤油療肺問題的本身。在醫學上還是一個很够研究的題目。但要循着研究科學的途徑去做。决不是宣傳的時期。尤其日報上醫藥刋物。乃是灌輸普通醫藥嘗識的所在。屬稿諸君。簡直就是社會衛生醫藥的講師。所有文字在乎使讀者有肯定認識。不是要使讀者驚奇訝異的。</p>
<p>至於醫家對於醫家自己。莫説煤油可以討論。卽是大量砒霜的效力如何。也可以談得。只要不施之於殺人範圍以内罷了。</p>
<p>國人的根性。善於模仿。不善研究。什麽政策。什麽主義。都不過東抄西襲。弄幾句口頭禪。灌輸到人民腦子裏。造成政客和靑年的政治狂。弄到國家危如累卵。倘若醫學上的大問題。也是標語式的宣傳。豈不要弄得民無噍類麽。</p>
<p>俗語説得好。放火容易救火難。煤油療肺已成潮勢。恐怕嘗試者。一時頗不乏人。好在最近楊郁生醫師由日本調查來的眞相。已在上期本刋發表了。丁惠康先生對於譯文的來源。也已聲明。並已登完。我看此潮應該暫告一個段落。至於已嘗試的君。也只好且自由他將來集其報告作研究的參考品罷！</p>
<h3>關於煤油療法之我見</h3>
<p>— 張致果</p>
<p>近來煤油治肺之説。囂傳社會。此説原見於日本之某婦女雜誌。在日本之醫界宿彥。是否注意此事。余未知悉。唯近時交通便利。消息靈通。醫學界中如有新頴學説。或驚人發見。大都於各國醫學刋物中卽競相轉載。而學者必紛投討論之文字。盈篇累牘。茲煤油治法在他國　然無聞。而獨喧傳於吾國。是誠可怪。且日人之發明此法。不爲彼邦正式醫報所發表。而先刋載於婦女雜誌。使人不能無疑。依余所見。無論此法合理或有效與否。在醫界中人。如認爲有研究之價値。當先加學理上及實騐上之探討。在醫界中互相討論。待有相當成績。然後施用於病人。而公布於社會。若貿然以人爲試騐。且公布其服法。宣揚其效能。似非所宜。</p>
<p>近來藥物學雖未臻上乘。然較之昔日。不啻天壤。昔時一切藥物。均由試用而來。或得之於土法。例如金鷄納之治瘧是也。今之治藥物學者。不但分析藥物而欲知其他學構造。且探究其效能何在。卽研究其分子之構造若何。然後必有某種生理作用。故人造之藥品。其功效多勝於天然之產物。而發明藥品者。必先有理論。然後從事於集成。在藥品尙未製出以前。已能預知其功用。例如六○六及阿篤理那林等之發明是也。夫煤油之成分知之已久。若果有治癆之效。則欲探求其理。並非甚難。或煤油中之成分有直接能殺滅結核菌者。或能引起一種生理作用。使間接不利於結核菌者。唯煤油服下後。吸收若何。排洩若何。在身體内起若何化學變化。亦須由動物試騐詳細研究之。總之。在今日。由藥理化學及化學治療學之學理及方法。以研究煤油果否有治肺癆之功效。事屬可爲。乃不此之圖。而盲聽傳説。以試用爲研究之方法。殊非學者所應爲。况以病人爲試騐。是背人道也。日本醫者或有爲此者。焉必引爲殷鑒而附從之。質之同道。以爲何如。</p>
<h3>煤油療肺經過之一瞥</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>肺結核菌不直接發生毒質。其在人體後之所以發生各種不快之現象者。完全由於過敏性反應Ａｌｌｅｒｇｉｅ而來。故有時其病灶並不甚廣。而高熱咯血。險象環生。此過敏性反應現象之亢進也。又有兩肺或完全爲病灶所占據。而健步如常。非其病原菌之各異。此反應力之强弱不同之所致也。</p>
<p>自德國醫家柯赫氏。發明結核病原菌以來。其後卽發明結核菌專劑杜白苦靈。但時至今日。該劑於治療上。仍無卓越之成績。在現代結核治療上。多已不甚賞用。故結核之是否有特效藥。不特爲醫藥界上之一重要問題。實與全世界民族之健康。亦有極大之關係。在結核蔓延極廣之我國。尤爲醫家與病家最注意之一事。</p>
<p>吾人知結核菌體之百人之四十爲蠟質。其難於撲滅之原因。或基於此。科學雖日前進。而結核之特效藥。仍未發見。而吾人仍如大旱之望雲霓也。最近日本流行煤油治療。其間分反對與贊成二派。均有相當之理由。大凡一事之成。最先必有反對之者。煤油若無確效。則其試騐不數月間。盡將烟消火滅。果若有效。則此後當然無入反對。在此試騐期中。反對者愈多。則眞理愈明。槪可預斷。此學術界應有之現象也　　日本反對諸家之言曰。帝大藥學生任林春雄氏云。肺病全在療養。煤油殊不可靠。應病院平井文雄氏。謂結核菌抵抗力較强。煤油决非有效之殺菌劑。北里研究所病院大谷彬亮氏謂煤油療法。毫無理由。害多而利少。帝大醫學部長與又郎博士。謂煤油治肺。全是迷信。並爲日本百五十萬患者。憂慮而戰憟。</p>
<p>其贊成者如速水寅一氏云。煤油對於結核菌之有害作用。可於培養基上見之。據其經騐。則煤油絶對無害。雖非百試百騐。然在有經騐之醫師指導試服。則其效果。確非他種藥物可比。其飲用量。則視各人之病症體格而爲增减。約而言之。自少量漸漸增加。最爲合理。如有腹瀉或嘔吐者。次回宜减少其飲量。又煤油之適應症。爲肋膜炎肺炎腎炎肝炎極衰弱之肺結核患而無合併症之患者。皆有特效。此外又可用之於糖尿病及喘息。且能驅除十二脂腸，不日將其實騐結果。在醫學雜誌發表云。　　自煤油可治肺病發表以來。極爲社會人士所注意。若果有效。則可稱爲最經濟之療法。設若有害。則不知幾百萬人。胥將受其流毒。故不論何人。皆欲知其究竟。日本黎明會。爲預防結核會之一。以爲徒作空言。不如蒐集人證。爰於去冬徵集病家試服煤油實騐記。得八十人。謂確有效果三十二人。謂其有害者二十一人。（其中飲法有誤者十一人。）此外則爲無效果者。（謹按國内若有曾經試飲者。請將其實騐經過。不論有效無效。作一簡單報告。惠賜敝人。當刋一專集。以公開報告。亦關心諸君所樂聞歟。其黎明會所得之報告。現在付印。不日卽可出版。）</p>
<p>煤油何以有效。現時尙未以斷定。大約在體内經過吸收作用後。雖不能殺結核菌。然吸收於血液中。或有遏制結核菌蕃殖之能力。縮短其治療時間。則</p>
<p>其效力己非普通藥物所可比矣。</p>
<p>吾國肺病患者。初無確實統計。若以日本患者之比例觀之。則我國當有一千萬以上之患者。其影響於社會國家實</p>
<p>大。故對於結核治療與預防問題之研究。實爲我儕之急務。觀夫日本諸家批評煤油治療之衆多。及患者試用之熱烈。深覺有實地試騐之必要。而其先决問題。乃飲服煤油後患者是否將亢進其過敏性反應。有各種不快之副作用。如注射杜白苦靈後。往往引起病灶反應。而致病勢增劇。蓋人命至重。我儕之職責。首在預防疾病之發生。其次乃屬於治療。使其就痊。若不能則當設法減少其痛苦。斷不可貿然令人試服。使呻吟床褥者。益增其痛苦。故於臨床實騐。每欲試而又罷。</p>
<p>在門診期間。乃有令人不可思議之二例。某婦之言曰。病肺二年。已臥床不能行動者已閲月。今飲服煤油數次。竟能起身。故踵門求治。其二爲一浦東鄉人。經過亦大致相同。試服煤油。當然不可僅以此二人卽作爲有效之定律。但飲用煤油後無甚害處。槪可證明。予卽進而令住院患者飲服煤油。共十二例。其初次量爲四西西。晚間空腹時服。其後每隔四日或五六日服第二次。其量每次加二西西。至十二西西爲止。其間有腸結核二人。腹膜結核一人。脊髓結核一人。以及沉重之兩邊浸潤滲出性結核二人。以上均經過Ｘ光及顯微鏡檢查。此數人其預後均屬極嚴重者。乃經過煤油治療後。並無不良之影響。多有輕快之感。同時當然並應用其他諸種合理療法。</p>
<p>約而言之。飲用煤患之不快現象。爲腹瀉腹痛。不眠發熱。但大多僅經過一二日。卽行消失。而在飲服第二三次之後。卽不復有腹瀉等現象發生。其對於患者之佳良影響。爲精神爽快。食慾增進。其餘則因實騐之時日尙短。患者最多不過服至五六次。故不能多所陳述。</p>
<p>以余個人一月來之觀察。則煤油之效果。尙未能斷定。宜在無害之程度嘗試最佳。若以爲煤油乃療肺聖藥。飲用二三次。卽望全治者。殆爲不可能之事實。又以爲害多利少。是用之不得其法也。第一次試用。須視病人之體質。衰弱之程度。胃腸之强弱。而用少量嘗試。而次回飲用。須隔相當時日。更不可强求見效。若有一切不良現狀發生。宜立卽停止。再好經醫師之指導。則危險較少。同時勿怠本來之自然療法。則其結果之如何。此時尙未敢論定也。日内擬卽東渡。以觀彼邦治療之究竟。此煤油療肺之謎。定當打破。以告讀者諸君也。（函詢諸公恕不另覆）</p>

<h3>芻狗</h3>
<p>— 天山</p>
<p>據説楚人的巫風甚盛，這大槪與苗族的迷信，習俗，很有關聯，讓民俗學者去弄這問題吧，而最有趣味的，是巫祝時常用乾草紥成一個狗形，恭恭敬敬盛在篋子里，還紥上許多花布，然後齋戒沐浴，向牠敬拜或跳舞、這麽弄了一大通之後，抛了。—這東西，古人謂之『芻狗』。</p>
<p>這套把戲見於古書，不知湖南湖北，近來還有這種習俗否？老子昔日説過：『天地不仁，以萬物爲芻狗，』那麽這種風氣，當日也很在北方傳播着的吧。所謂不仁者，是用得着時，對之甚恭甚敬，及其已陳列之後。抛掉了，『行者踐其首　，蘇者取而　之』，卽是將其踐踏了，燒掉了。</p>
<p>是爲治病呢，　災呢，抑玩弄呢？現在很難知道了。大槪有相當的作用吧！天地造人類大槪沒有特殊作用，其爲『玩弄』，也許很可能。萬物皆有成毁，損益，始卒，生死，老子視之猶芻狗然。顯然兩個不同的時代和環境，而芻狗本身忽而昇天，忽而入地，本身是無所容心的。</p>
<p>看來現在許多人事，何莫非然·西洋人對待中國人，上等人對待下等人，甚而至於異性對於異性，何嘗不也是這麽一個方法！飛之於前，箝之於後，用之於左，棄之於右·中國人是和平的民族呀！古國呀！孔子呀！親善呀！可佩服呀！英雄呀！······這麽熱辣辣的捧，拍，吹，不管中國人受得住或受不住。及至中國人都變成了白種人或日本人的奴隸。吸去了這民族的脂膏，他們都名成事遂，心滿意足呢，這時便不親善了，不佩服了，將其踐踏到泥坑裏，不准翻身。這時的論調也改變了：中國人原來是野蠻人，只配當奴隸！······</p>
<p>有誰在窰子裏游玩過麽！他該知道那麽許多親愛的原由。也許失職的官僚或被遺棄的婦女，對這個感到最親切！但現代許多英雄或志在做英雄的人們，爲芻狗而猶飄飄然，忘其形，只想萬歲萬萬歲！</p>

<p>昨天我看見兩個騎着戰馬在大街大奔馳的丘八，不帶鞭，不掛槍，脇間挾滿了盛開的桃花。今天出門，迎面便逢着一個玩弄柳枝的婦人。</p>
<p>丘八的花，不知贈與何人；婦人的柳枝，想必有所繫而折也。</p>
<p>眞的春天是這樣地消逝了罷？</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>Ｃａｌｅｎｄａｒ我常是幾天一撕的，今年的Ｅａｓｔｅｒ不經意地又已經到字紙簍子裏去了。耶穌基督在春天裏受難，在春天裏復活。</p>
<p>春天是與『上帝』同在麽？阿門。</p>
<p>『春天的消逝』，怕又是一個無神論者了。</p>
<h3>昆明的翠湖</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>雖然住在昆明，但爲着生活，使我只有放假的日子，得有這末一個機會去逛逛翠湖。</p>
<p>因爲好久不去了，不知什麽時候，翠湖上，春已經悄悄來臨。滿湖是一片翡翠般可愛的新綠色，湖堤上的楊柳，給旭日照着，如浴後的少女，凝眸當風，亭亭玉立。夾在這嫵媚鮮麗的綠陰中的，是艷妝得這般可人的紅桃，彷彿在含羞嬌笑！</p>
<p>一彎河水，環繞着半個翠湖，淸漣灧灧，滌人　濁。河畔的柳枝在水面上飄着，飄着，——一個洗衣婦人蹲在河旁，任輕狂的柳枝撫摸着頭髮：爲什麽不呢？它們是那麽溫柔，那麽舒適。</p>
<p>沿着湖堤慢慢的走着，覺得自家此時眞是翠湖的主人。在這鳥雀歡呼，天朗氣淸的早晨，沒有午後穿紅帶綠的那般俗客，沒有雜沓的語聲，沒有品茗的高士，有的只是一片幽靜。</p>
<p>朱紅的亭台，半藏在濃密的柳樹叢中。水月仙，海心亭，都靜悄悄的矗立着，沒有夏日荷花盛開時的那般熱鬧。偶而，一個大魚從水裏躍起，跋刺一聲，衝破了水面上的沉寂。</p>
<p>在炎夏時節，茶客擁擠，極一時之盛的綠楊村，很蕭條的緊閉着柴門。婉轉的歌喉，幽怨的笛音，已聽不到了。只有一枝紅櫻桃花，把頭伸在枯索的竹籬上，似乎在嘲笑對面的那株光秃秃的白楊：你爲什麽還不開花呢？</p>
<p>游泳池的黃牆紅瓦，掩映在嫩綠的樹葉裏，一個農人正從對面駕着一隻小艇過來，在淸澄如鏡的水底裏，我看見蔚藍的天，無數捉摸不到的樹的倒影，－碧油油的，是怎樣可愛呵，這水底裏的世界！</p>
<p>走到橋那邊，回頭一看：那綠的柳，紅的桃，都像怕羞的美人，給一層輕綃似的白霧裏住了，只有近一點的，還隱約現出一些糢糊的淸姿。</p>
<p>浮在水上的幾隻白鷺，見着人來，驚恐着，抬頭望了一望，便啪啪的飛開了。遊到堤邊來的，是紅的魚，靑的魚，···················</p>
<p>佇立在橋上，迎着溫和欲醉的曉風，聽那一聲聲淸脆的島音，不禁有悠然出塵之想。</p>
<h3>鳥中籠</h3>
<p>— 蒲風</p>
<p>不要唱吧，小東西！</p>
<p>幸福可曾厚待你？</p>
<p>快樂可曾全付你—</p>
<p>我傷心，你在狹小的牢籠裏裝歡喜！</p>
<p>不要跳吧，小東西！</p>
<p>點點食物人給你，</p>
<p>滴滴冷水人給你！—我傷心，你不害羞的躍跳在牢籠裏！</p>
<p>啊！穿過你的栅，小東西，</p>
<p>你看看廣闊的靑的的世界吧！</p>
<h3>北平素描（六）窩窩頭</h3>
<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>北平的勞動階級通常是不喫飯的。像上海同興樓拿手的『京菜』和各地菜館招牌上的『滿漢全席』，只是北平享樂階級的口味，其實不足以代表北平一般人的伙食。他們吃的不是什麽『燒鴨子』『溜魚片』之類的東西，只是『烙餅』，『蕎麥切麫』，『燒餅』，『窩窩頭』等等－尤其是『窩窩頭』。</p>
<p>他們的家裏都會做這種粗爄的麫食，但在街上買吃的似乎也很多。在市口的路旁有許多露天的小攤子，各種麫食都有得賣。這就是他們的『菜館』，他們買『飽』的地方。這種小攤子都是很矮的，攤面是一塊約摸像方桌面大小的木板擱在　籃上，四周是半尺來高的矮凳。攤面上有些碗碟，正中有一鍋熱騰騰的湯。旁邊另有一塊木板，上面有一架蒸籠，厚厚地覆着麻袋布。揭開來底下是『包子』，『花捲兒』，『窩窩頭』。『烙餅』</p>
<p>，『燒餅』，『切麫』，之類，都不需保溫，只在攤面上露天陳列着。</p>
<p>光顧這種小攤的吃客當然都是所謂的『下層級』</p>
<p>，尤其是洋車夫。他們跑得滿臉油汗，掙了幾十枚銅子，就需要裝幾個『窩窩頭』到肚皮裏，纔有氣力拉第二個生意。價錢是不用問的，大家都知道：雖沒有什麽折扣可打，倒也沒有『堂彩』，『小賬』等額外的花費。</p>
<p>四個大銅子在攤面上，擺攤的就在麻袋布下摸出一個窩窩頭給你－不用問的。這個黃色的，直徑有二寸二三分的東西是用玉米或小米的粗粉做的；圓底高頂，底下有一個很深的凹窩，因此纔有這奇怪的名稱。熱騰騰的玉米香和微甜的玉米味，是飢餓者的安慰，代替了『燒鴨子』『溜魚片』的地位。假使再多花幾個銅子，就可以吃半斤『烙餅』，喝一碗菠菜湯；拉車時可以不致於脱力『倒斃』了。</p>
<p>跑了整天的腿，假使多掙了些錢，那麽就可以飽餐一頓，甚至於吃一二塊猪頭肉或來一碟芽豆之類的美味。但這是近乎『滿漢全席』了。</p>
<h3>『白話』『文言』新論（續）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>又有人覺得白話文不利於誦讀，那是眞的。自從文言嬗變而爲語體，許多舊文人覺得有些不慣；若請舊文人講授語體文，竟是猢猻離樹，全無伎倆。原來文言文最重聲律，林琴南謂『音聲一道，其疾徐高下抑揚抗墜之分，不獨有韵之文有之，卽無韵之文亦有之。······試取古人之文讀之，有噲吰　鞳者，有細微要眇者，有急絃促管者，有緩節安歌者，大約言樂者多和，叙哀者善咽，······此其自然而然，雖作者亦有不自知者乎！』得其旨矣。桐城派古文文名簡短，聲律調和，誦之琅琅上口。舊文人敎人作文，先從朗誦入手；自已下筆作文，亦必搖頭哼讀，都是做聲律調和的工夫。白話文增加了許多詞語，每句很長很多，加以排列不得當，讀起來總是詰誳聱牙，所以日文人總覺得有些不慣。白話文的白話，和口頭的白話，又相隔一層；讀白話文並不如聽人説的流暢，新文人也默認白話文只是看的作品並不是讀的作品。林語堂先生惡白話之文而喜文言之白；説是『語錄簡鍊可如文言，質樸可如白話，有白話之爽利，無白話之嚕囌。』實則林先生看不慣人爲的文句，要恢復天籟的文句，語錄體與口語較爲接近，所以合他的脾胃的。前幾年，徐彬彬先生提倡劇體散文，謂『劇詞之分類有唱詞與念白之兩大類，而念白又有技術白與自然白之分。技術白卽是一種音樂的發音術，介乎歐（化）與話之間者也。其所以成功，乃本於人類氣區之自然及中國之方體單音字需要而成。』他要利用自然韵律來造成新的劇體散文，和林語堂先生的主張頗相接近的。</p>
<p>這樣看來，白話文的複雜結構不可不保留，而自然韵律又不可不利用；白話文不當僅爲看的作品，仍當注以聲律使復活爲讀的作品，其理甚明。究竟如何下工夫方能達到這個目的？我想提出一個小小的意見：文字與語言是雙方並進，互相影響的；我們希望文章有進步，必須希望語言先有進步。諸子之文，大得力於遊談之風，魏晋淸談盛行乃產生瑰麗的美文：我們要產生活的白話敎文，必須毁棄宋明理學家所提倡的沉默寡言的虚僞的美德；孔門有言語之科，一個作家不當伏案頭修飾他的詞句，應當從街頭練習他的舌頭。語言永遠是文字的先進前輩，求文字進步於語言之中，也可以説是小小的復古工作吧：（完）</p>

<h3>半天的功課（六）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>塲裏一些穿長袍外罩馬褂的職員，胸前佩着緞帶，不住地在講演臺的前後奔走着，那樣的忙忙碌碌，像是總也作不完該作的事情。他們作的眞有興緻，他們眞是替新國家賣足了氣力。</p>
<p>各校領隊的訓育主任，還有敎員，校長都聚在臺後的蓆棚中説笑着，看他們那種樣子，誰也不像想過今天是一個悲痛的日子。然而，他們又都是高出一般民衆的知識階級。在人衆喧閙中，忽然從塲裏的西北角上刮來一陣大旋風，把地面上的沙土刮到半空中，人們避開風勢亂奔着，呌喊着。風慢慢地越過講演臺，從我們隊伍的前面刮到墻外去了。這樣淸朗的秋天，誰也料不到會刮起這樣大的旋風的，有如遇到一件新奇的事情，人們亂七八糟地嘟嚕着：</p>
<p>『好大旋風，不知道有什麽説。』</p>
<p>『眞大，上頭一直到半天空。』</p>
<p>『大晴天，刮哪上旋風！』</p>
<p>『一定有故事。』</p>
<p>這，實在是件意想不到的奇遇，不但悶熱吵閙的塲子裏，立刻變了個樣子，我還可以用這一陣旋風來比喻，我們未來的厄運。有些人不住地喊着迷了眼睛，那麽，這正可以説大厄運光臨之前先撒了一把迷眼的沙子。總有一天，這大旋風會刮來的，它飛起來的沙石，會迷住了我們的眼睛，會擊傷我們的身體，它就是吃人不見血的日本帝國主義！</p>
<p>記得小時候在門外玩耍時，一遇到刮旋風，就唱母親敎給的歌曲，母親説那歌曲是可以嚇走旋風的：</p>
<p>『旋風旋風你是鬼，三把搏刀斫你腿。』</p>
<p>過一會旋風刮走了，眞以爲是歌曲嚇走了。想一想這有趣的事情，不管它怎樣的好笑，至少限度，還是有着幾分以搏刀爲武器抗拒的力量，現在呢，對於當前眞正的大旋風，有誰敢説出什麽！</p>
<p>一連開進塲裏三輛汽車，　警密佈在路旁頻頻地致敬，我知道這一定是要人到塲了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>國際共管</h3>
<p>— 姑射</p>
<p>昨見報載，有法國晨報記者白利掩在重慶發表言論，謂日本請各國共管中國，國際派賈德幹任長江一帶調查，石密士任黃河一帶調查，白氏本人，則任西南調查云。我外交界認爲未之前聞，並表示日本對中國夙懷野心，但國際亦斷不致爲日人矇蔽至此，可信絶無此種事實。這消息眞有趣極了。國際共管中國，這論調本不自今日始，差不多是十數年來國際帝國主義對中國一致的陰謀。不過往時牠們多少有點遮遮掩掩，難於提議，總在側面提出，有其實而不居其名。而這次白利掩氏，居然在中國領土之内，公然説出共管的話。坦坦白白，毫無一點掩蔽。這似乎還是第一次。</p>
<p>也許有人以爲白利掩氏不過是一個報館記者，其言論未必有力量，也未必可以盡信罷。所以我國外交界説：『可信絶無此種事實』。其守不然的。國際共管，這問題在國際帝國主義間，事實上是早商量多年，終因爲各國利害不同，衝突過甚，所以雖有其議，而迄未實現。這不是牠們早先不知共管，而是各國的步調不一致，無法來履行共管。而現在呢：日本的九一八事變的爆發，雖破壞了東亞的均勢，但同時，國聯技術合作，美國棉麥大借欵，又相當地挽回了這均勢。日本已占有『滿洲』，目前所需要的，是亟亟『建設滿洲』，暫時似乎不必再向關内發展。英國在東三省，利益本輕，除開印度棉市塲問題，她對於日本本無怎樣激烈的衝突。而日本九一八，一二八兩次進攻中國，也並未直接威脅到英國的在華利益。所以英日兩國，在對華政策上，本無不可妥洽之處。同時美國，在對華政策上，雖與日本立於激急鬥爭的尖鋭對立地位，但日本早已向美國暗送秋波了：除開滿洲，儘揀肥的，由你去宰割罷。日本這種有限度的退讓，多少會挽回美國不少的好感。加以英美的衝突，也有使美國顧慮到不要對日本立於過甚的地步。所以，史汀生不承認主義剛發表不過一年多，美日又以互相諒解聞了。同時，世界資本主義穩定的終結，震撼着每一個金元資本家的賓座，在這時，也有使他們覺得有暫時與利害不同者携手，造成相當均勢局面，來更以全副力量，共同宰割世界殖民地，榨取他們，補償一點自己的損失的必要。這樣，國際共管中國，就又應時而起了。</p>
<p>這不是憑空而來的，這是歷史進到某時期所必然的產物。</p>
<p>各國覺得對華有步調一致的需要，其結果便是『共管』，反之，則是『瓜分』</p>
<p>。這不是『可信絶非事實』或『可信是事實』我們自己所能决定的問題，也不是我們願意不願意的問題，而是牠們愛怎樣幹便怎樣幹。『分割』的滋味，我們已經</p>
<p>嘗够了，以往二十餘年的中國政治，便　是其具體表現；現在，我們再來等着嘗『共管』的味道罷。</p>
<h3>淸早碰釘子記</h3>
<p>— 純</p>
<p>昨夜黃梁一夢，顚顚倒倒，窮光蛋頓成富翁，高居駟馬，呼童子，倒參湯，喉嚨燙痛，大嗆三聲而醒，開眼一看，滿屋烏黑，時鐘正敲兩下，原來是夢景歡欣，夢中情形，細細玩味，實覺津津不忍釋，不禁心頭熱起，汗出遍身，透過襯衫褲，滲過棉被，人宛似水田雞一只，翻翻覆覆足有三個鐘頭未曾睡去，早上醒來，忽見日光已照床脚，連忙翻身踢被而起，門前　飩擔已經挑走，只能將肚子忍忍，早餐不吃，坐在凳上發　，想到夜來夢景，貴客不臨賤地，空穴豈有來風，不無寓有佳兆，於是拉開抽屜，將前日買之航空奬券一條，細細把玩，對鏡自照，左眼端詳臉相，右眼熟視航空奬券，兩相對照，加以觀摩，究竟有無吻合之點，正在悠然神往，忽聽剝啄一聲，二阿媽推門而進「吁，黎明卽起，聖人之道，今日上三竿，方始翻身，豈讀書人應所如是，」二阿媽見我尙蓬頭垢面，不免先行敎訓一番，余唯唯無以應·忽見我正在玩弄航空</p>
<p>奬券卽問所玩何物，經此一問，頓使余興高十丈，於是手揮足舞，侃侃而談，「此名航空奬券，由政府所發行令全國人士購買·每張一個號目，每號分成十條，每張買十元每條一元，三個月一次，將售得之錢，一部份政府作建設航空公路用，一部份作爲奬金，將金分配之法，卽將所售出之號目，當衆搖出頭奬二奬三奬······等，如搖出之頭奬號目與自已購得者相合，一條可得五萬元，一張可得五十萬·此舉盡善盡美，在政府可收集腋成裘之功，在人民可無發財無路之歎，不幸而不中則所費無幾，幸而</p>
<p>中，則白手可以成家，赤貧能成鉅富，亦大可樂乎，在窮光蛋看來，實屬蜚黃騰達之終南捷徑，」余打開話匣，傾囊而倒，唾沫四濺，忽見二阿媽面呈不豫之色，口角牽動，似欲阻止　言者，余隨卽　　　但唾沫一口已吐在二阿媽　角之上，　　夜明珠一顆，　　　阿　搖頭而　曰·一所謂航空奬券者，卽彩票也，是驅天下之民以入于孤注僥倖之一途，擲血汗之資，以冀萬一充其量不至于傾家蕩產不止，昔日彩票，旣已禁絶，現在豈得變樣之所謂航空奬券發生，余聞至此，不禁冷汗直流，隨卽關窗閉戶，以防隔牆窗外，何物老嫗，敢發荒謬之論，二阿媽視若無睹，仍滔滔不絶曰·「汝二阿爺生時，終年在外，未有一錢寄家，那年凶耗傳來，余星夜趕出，人已斷氣，室徒四壁，僅存破棉被一條，枕邊銅子十三個，箱子一只，打開滿滿疊疊，全是未中彩票，余一慟欲絶，彼買彩票一生，落此下塲，小子不求埋頭上進，但冀横財飛來，其無善後乎，其無善後乎」二阿媽滿面怒容，悻悻然而出·余垂首而立，頭不敢擡，口不敢辯，惟有唯唯否否躬送門外，</p>
<h3>吃甘蔗</h3>
<p>— 赤子</p>
<p>剛吃了夜飯，閒閒地同一個朋友到街上去蕩。去過紅綠燈交輝的十字馬路，走過射着五色光彩的大戲院，終於走到了一所水果店。</p>
<p>水果攤上，陳着各式各樣的果兒，長長的，圓圓的。但我不知什麽緣故，却想吃甘蔗，於是便用代價購了兩段。在這世界裏，一切都可用金錢購，我不禁對着甘蔗而自豪。</p>
<p>很快的回到校裏，拭凈了帶着銹的刀，便向蔗姑娘進攻。</p>
<p>首先括去蔗姑娘底皮，這時她已由靑而黃了。接着又把她橫着切成數段，然後再送到嘴裏。我用着牙加了重壓力，汁水便涔涔地流出來，我吮着，我狂吮着。蔗姑娘似乎一點沒有抵抗力，於是我更放肆，更瘋狂地再咬，再吮，終於把蔗姑娘榨得由豐滿而消瘦，由消瘦而乾癟了。</p>
<p>蔗姑娘看來是沒有再可榨了，便向地上一丢。</p>
<p>我望着零亂在地上靜靜地躺着的渣。節，　，露出了勝利的微笑</p>
<h3>環境與本性</h3>
<p>— 夢石</p>
<p>環境與本性，是支配人類行爲的兩種要素。環境可以使人行善，也可以使人作惡；本性會呌你變成好人，也會呌你變成壞人。一個人的動作，旣然逃不掉環境與本性的影響；可知環境與本性，對於人類行爲的關係，是如何密切重大。</p>
<p>人類的本性，其原質是怎樣呢？這有三種説法。（一）性善論者謂，人類的本性，是由先天所賦予，生下來就是善的。社會之所以有惡人，其行爲是從後天所養成；換言之，卽是受環境的左右。（二）性惡論者的主張反乎是，以爲一個人先天所帶來的本性是惡的；但這種惡本性，亦可以受環境的薰陶而變善。（三）是一種調和論。這派人説，人類的本性，好比一張白紙，旣非生下來就是善，亦非先天本是惡；牠是可善可惡，受環境所渲染，才變紅或變黑的。</p>
<p>關於人類本性的善惡，這本屬於玄學範圍内的問題，我們且不去管牠。惟無論本性是善也好，是惡也好，是非善非惡也好，我們總不能不承認本性和行爲是有着很深切的關係。在這裏，我們先來説一説環境對於行爲的影響這件事。我們時常看到同一人，在某種環境裏，行爲是這樣；於别種環境下，動作又是那樣。這是什麽原故呢？這便是因爲這個人所處的環境，先後不同；所以其所表現出來的行動，也就兩樣。</p>
<p>一個人的行爲，對於社會所發生的影響，甚然重大，本應担負一種行爲上責任。但自從人類明白了個已的動作，是受環境所支配這個新發現之後，許多人都把行爲上的責任，推卸在環境上，</p>
<p>想呌環境代他担負。那是件不可否認的事實，人類的種種不法行爲，往往是由不良環境所造成。例如當一個人給生活</p>
<p>壓迫得非常苦痛的時候，若不甘屈服，便要反抗，或挺而走險，從死裏去求生。又如我們所居住的這大上海社會，便是製造各種罪惡的魔窟。上海社會的環境，是異常惡劣的；一班行爲純正的人，一踏入此地，就會幹起作奸犯科的事來。這皆是環境左右人的舉動的明證。依此看來，個人的行爲，旣不能自主，盡聽外界環境的擺布；那末其行爲顯然是被動的；其行爲上的責任，當然不在本身，而應由環境去肩負了。</p>
<p>然則環境果是一切罪惡的淵源麽？一個人的行動，除了給環境的支配，便一點自主力都沒有了麽？若眞的是這樣</p>
<p>，那末人類不過是一架機械，是一種環境的奴隸而已：其行爲旣盡受環境的指使，其行爲上的責任，自然也要給環境</p>
<p>去担負。不過我們常見有些人生來本性就是良善正直的，其行爲十分規矩，永不願作惡。又有些人的確生來就是狂暴的，凶悍的，好作亂爲非的。沒有殺人的必要，偏要殺人；衣食豐足了，還要幹那盜竊搶刦的勾當：明知其損人亦無利於已，却非把人家陷害不可。凡這種種，其行動也是由環境所迫逼使然的嗎？其犯罪的責任，也應推在環境的身上嗎？並且，我們也很常看到在同樣一個環境當中，可以產生出幾種品質不同的人，或製造出各樣差異，甚至有時有相反的行爲。這又應該怎樣去解釋呢？在</p>
<p>這裏，我們又不得不承認人類的動作，不但和環境有密切的關係；其所受本性的影響，也甚重大。有的人，生來就是善良的，無論在那一種環境裏，他都不改其本性；反之，有的人，先天性本是惡劣的，環境卽使怎樣改換，他的行爲總是越出軌外。但這是本性堅强的，才能如此；若本性柔弱者，就不然了；他的行爲，便要隨環境而轉移；於良好的環境中，他的行爲就變善了，於惡劣的環境裏，他的舉動就變壞了。不過這裏有一點是千萬不可忽略的，卽本性的善惡，往往也是由環境所造成；所謂先天的賦予，想是很微薄的吧？所以我們相信環境對於人類行爲的影響，其力量比本性來得大。</p>
<p>依上面所述，我們在道一個人的一舉一動，總逃不出環境　本性的支　　因此，我們若希望人類的行爲能趨善避惡，能合乎規矩法度，而不敢犯罪違禁，就應注意到環境和本性，把環境和本性加以改造。現今到處常聽到一班人慨歎着什麽「世道衰微，人心險詐。」但世道爲何會衰微呢？人心又怎樣會險詐呢？這就是因爲目下社會環境非常惡劣，人類本性非常缺陷所致。補救之道，舍改變環境和刷新本性，實無别策。要改變環境，應根本把舊社會裏陳腐惡劣的環境推翻，創造一合理舒適的新環境。最急切重要者，還是物質環境的改變。「衣食足而後知榮辱」，一個人旣不　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　安居樂業，好好地做人，簡直是妄想。且物質環境又是各種文物制度的下層基礎；故改變物質環境，是改變一切環境的先决條件。因爲特質環境沒有改變，其他如政治法律宗敎藝術等組織，便也無從改變。至本性的刷新。敎育當然是個很有力量的工具。此處所説的敎育。不是單指學校敎育：胎敎，家庭敎育，以至社會敎育，也十分重要。我們不但要使每個兒童時時刻刻養成各種良好習慣，優美思想，高尙道德；大人還要以身作則，做好榜樣給他們看。這樣潛移默化，人類的本性，就會漸漸改善了。　　　　　　　　　　　　用擊化的方法，非法令所能收　的。</p>

<h3>遠東運動與圓桌會議</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>日本自從九一八以後、在一手包辦之下，造成了一個所謂僞滿洲國，但終於因一時在國　方面，得不到同情而誰也不承認僞滿是一個獨立的國家，但他們却不會死心，任何卑鄙齷齪的事情也做得出來，千方百計在國際方面活動。　　這一次遠東運動將在菲列濱舉行，而日本又得到了一個機會，硬要拉攏僞滿的加入遠東運動，明眼人不必細説，如果准許加入而後，中國形式上雖不承認僞國，而事實上一度的遠東運動，已實際是承認僞滿了。他們的目的，無非在利用體育的機會，來作政治侵略，誘人上鈎，所以先而要求正式加入，繼而要求個人參加，奸滑陰險的手段，如同燭照，碰了幾次的釘子，還沒有死心踏意，到而今又弄出了什麽圓桌會議的鬼戲。</p>
<p>根據遠東運動的規則，新會員的加入，要得到全體會員國的同意通過，有一個會員國反對，便不凖加入，那麽祇要中國反對了便可拒絶加入，反對的原因，就在僞洲不是一個正式的國家，帝國主義用侵略行爲奪得的一部分土地，被侵略的人决不認其自已的土地爲一個獨立國的，所以絶對拒絶，名正言順，很冠冕堂皇的一件事。</p>
<p>進一步講，在中國堅决的反對聲中，倘然日本一定要不願公理，硬拉僞滿的加入，那麽中國可退出遠東運動，事件的解决，是很簡單的，不知一般的體育當局，又何必虚與委蛇，多費口舌。要知犧牲體育事小，犧牲國家事大，所以在我們的希望中，圓桌會議在上海舉行的時候，出席的代表，祇須根據了這一點去爭議就是了。</p>
<p>總之遠東運動會中有了僞國的代表，與會各國，雖不承認僞國，事實上也承認了，所以日本這一次不惜千方百計，碰命的要拉攏僞滿加入。他們的鬼計，國人又那個不知呢？因此，在遠東運動開幕之前，所謂圓桌會議在上海舉行的時候，中國的代表，在任何條件之下，中不應允許僞國代表加入的。</p>
<h3>不希奇的事</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>爲着生活的奔馳，許久，都沒有和曼會見了。不知怎麽，近來的心中，總有着一層隱憂，彷彿曼會發生什麽變故似的。</p>
<p>實在，曼是有着獨物的個性的，同時，也有着狹窄的心胸的；當某一件事實發生的時候，如果不適宜於他個性的話，或竟全部的違反的時候，他會不能緘默而非議的，而責難的，雖然他也很明白自已，在相比之下，是一滴涙水和一潭淸溪的比値。</p>
<p>其結果，自然他是不會有益的，至多，除了能得些訕笑的面孔和敷衍性的一些溫馨以外，其餘的，只有可怕的暗影在跟隨着他搖晃。</p>
<p>然而這，他是不曾感覺的，因爲他深信着自己的一切。在紛亂的心情不能解脱的時候，他常常地在想着！『還不如死了痛快』呵！</p>
<p>於此，他失業了，一轉眼就是半年。但，但，他究竟是『人』呵，他究竟是不能因了個性的關係而不需要生活的供應呵！</p>
<p>窮困着，苦惱着，他在萬不得己時，也曾擬議着『死』的打算。</p>
<p>但友朋間，少有他的影子存在着。不，有的，那只是在某一件類似的事件發生的時候：</p>
<p>－－前次，你忘記嗎？曼曾放過大砲呢！</p>
<p>除非在這樣的時候，他的影像，很少在人們的心上的。</p>
<p>在一個細雨的傍晚，我終於步上了往他家去的路。路上，我耽心着，怕他　　『生』之求企，使我們失去碰面的機會</p>
<p>上扶梯，這想像仍沒有消減，一直的到站在門口，　見門上是沒有加鎖的時候。</p>
<p>推開房門，一股膩人的氣息衝過來，雖則那窗子是開着的。曼，靜靜地躺在小鐵皮床上，在沉思着，自由布的長袍更骯髒了。可不是嗎？在他的臉上，分外的焦黃了，同時，是含藴着急迫，重憂，悲感的色調的。</p>
<p>言語，在相互的詢問着，可是，他的憂感始終沒有一絲的减輕。</p>
<p>『··········房租，最討厭，』他説：『來過三次了，我徐應他再過一個禮拜。有什麽辦法呢？吃，還在閙飢荒，那裏······唉！』深深地嘆息着。</p>
<p>門，又聞了，透進來一個女人的頭。臉上，塗滿了怪粉，一條條地肉紋縱横着，尤其那兩只眼睛，射着怕人的賊光。</p>
<p>－－你瞧，她聽見有人説話，故意的上來看看。眞的······唉！</p>
<p>出來的時候，一種灰暗的影子，蒙蔽了我心的周圍。</p>
<p>時間，不停的跑去，一天，二天，······不知怎麽，這幾天，心總在那樣的跳動着，跳動着。而且，有的時候，會不自禁的想着：『曼不知怎樣了，不會發生什麽變故吧？』想要去，總爲着瑣碎的事務絆住了。</p>
<p>第八天上，寄來了一封信，筆跡，多潦草呵，然而，無論如何，可以看得出是曼寫的。拆開，上面只寥寥地－－　　······爲生活所迫，不獲已而出此下策，江河無蓋，盡可葬身，祈轉達諸友好，勿以我爲念······</p>
<p>慌急的，跑到了他的寓所，床，不見了，紙張，凌亂的散滿了各處。</p>
<p>－他眞的去尋短見嗎？這，這，也詳不會吧！然而誰······？事實的景象和否定的理想在不住的交戰着，辯難着。　　問了問房東，得到的，依舊是個極籠統的含糊的回答。</p>
<p>分頭的，我們探詢着，探詢着。始終的，沒有一點兒消息。</p>
<p>－他，一定葬身魚腹了，在這裏，少有親友的輔助，生活的重壓，使他不能抗禦下去。不必懐疑吧，他一定在隨着激越的波濤而漂去了！共同的我們想着，感嘆息。</p>
<p>死，無論誰都不能脱逃的，這是在人生中必然的一個階級，雖則在情况上有着相互的不同。這，是不値得希奇的，也是極平凡的；曼，不過是在平凡中</p>
<p>底平凡的一粒而已！</p>

<h3>暹羅漫譚（七）壁虎與四脚蛇</h3>
<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>暹羅是熱帶，爬蟲自然是特别多的，尤其是壁虎，更是司空見慣，不要説在那些潮濕的地方，就是很考究的洋房裏，墻上也爬滿了壁虎，牠們是不怕人，的有時兩只壁虎在天花板上打架，失足跌到你的頭上來了，牠們還是毫不畏懼的在你頭髮裏鬥個不休，當吃飯的時候，牠們會爬到檯上來向你吱吱的乞食，你要是不肯施捨幾顆白飯，牠們是怎麽也不肯走的。　　提起四脚蛇，眞是令人可怕，這東西平時是躱在划裏的，每當夜深人靜的當兒，牠就發出像大蛤蟆似的咯咯的怪聲牠有一種嗜好，就是歡喜睡在人們的被窠裏有時候早上起身，只見牠伏在你的肩旁，兩只鼠眼向你注視着，我是蒙牠光顧過三次的，現在想起來，還有些心跳呢。</p>
<p>六華僑槪况</p>
<p>中暹因爲歷史與地理的關係，所以僑暹的華人也較别處多據可靠的調查，至少在三百萬左右，暹羅的人口，號稱是有一千二百萬，但這數目是不很正確的，實際上至多不過八九百萬，而且有中國血統的，還佔了半數以上，因此，暹羅是華人的世界，確是不可掩的事實。</p>
<p>講到華僑的事業，範圍也是非常廣大的，如暹國主要的出產米木兩宗以及捲烟，製糖，火柴等工業，和大小各業商店，幾乎完全是我們僑胞在經營，而在内地務農或捕魚的，爲數亦不在少，這在表面上看，彷彿是華僑操縱了暹國經濟，可是暹羅能有今日的繁榮，實在還是我們僑胞的功勞。</p>
<p>我們要是以地方來區别，那末僑胞中最多的是潮州人，其次是廣州人與瓊州人，再次是梅縣的客籍人和福建人，最少的是江浙兩省人，上述六屬，各有一個會館，這是歷史最久的華僑團體，至於各業公會，還是近年才有的新興組織，總管全僑的，那就是中華總商會了。</p>
<p>商會，原是一種商業的集團，但暹羅的中華總商會，却等於一個公使館，因爲中暹旣無商約，自然是沒有外交官的設置所以以一切僑務，都歸商會辦理，於是商會主席地位之高，我們也就可以想見，唯其如此，各屬領袖對於這地位的爭奪，也就異常劇烈，再加以商業上的競爭，就形成了各屬分裂的局面。　　古人説自侮而後人侮之，這句話是不會錯的，暹政府近年來對於華人的種種壓迫，一方面固然是有人在幕後指使（如上次國聯否决某國侵華時，在出席的四十三國中，只有暹羅代表不投票，這就是一個明證）但僑胞們的不能團結，實在還是一個重大的原因。</p>

<p>ＴｈｅＳｈｕｎＰａｏＳｃｒｅｅｎＳｅｃｌｌｊｏｎ</p>
<h3>評「亡命者」（下）</h3>
<p>— 松井壽夫作巽之譯</p>
<p>這影片的描寫，不單是爲着獵奇趣味，在這描寫中間，很好地描出了强烈的正義威强壓着憎惡的那種心理。</p>
<p>這是原著者波倫斯實際地經騐着苦鬥着的活躍的記錄。到現在爲止，波倫斯依舊是受着追擊而在各處流浪。可是，一有機會，他還是勇敢地暴露着這種「鎖牢」的黑暗。所以，原作裏面並沒有獵奇趣味，他用血來記錄了他的體騐祗是爲着要使一般觀衆明確地認識監獄這種非時代的存在而捲起一種反抗的輿論。</p>
<p>以這原作，導演萊洛依體騐了波倫斯的體騐，用同樣强烈的正義威，來描寫這部作品。所以，部分的技巧儘有缺點，但是全體看來眞是很好地描出了</p>
<p>主人公和「鎖牢」的生活狀態。主人公凖備脱獄，要黑人替他用鐵槌打坯鎖的塲面，在森林沼澤中逃走的那種凄慘的情景，這些都是跨過死綫而將一切委諸人性本能的决死的鬥爭，都是脈動着人類本能的卓越的描寫。</p>
<p>但是，濮它姻金説：「在這部片子裏面，不像Ｈｅｌｌ‘ｓＨｉｇｈｗａｙ（羅朗，白朗導演）一般的提示出「爲什麽國家要容許這種非人道的中世紀的鎖獄制度存在」</p>
<p>這種理由。假使，能够將這兩部片子的較好的成份混合起來，那末我們也許可以得到一部完全的關於Ｃｂａｉｎｇａｎｇ的影片。」換言之，在這片子裏面的暴露，很可惜地在相差不過一紙的地方中止。當然，和上面説過的一樣，對於「鎖獄的暴露，卽使在這樣的程度，也已經有了相當的意義。尤其，這影片表明了這種制度的統制者是國家的一部，是國家之代言人的州政府，對於這點，這種暴露的成績，已經不能不説很偉大了。</p>
<p>眞的，這影片是澈底的暴露，我們通過這部作品，體騐了波倫斯的苦痛的經騐，而被支配在强烈的憎惡的感情下面。</p>
<p>祇是，這部影片旣然是藝術的作品，那末，我們不能不説，這片子對於暴露作品所應有的作用以上的作用—就是對於到未來之發展和决心，還是非常的薄弱。當我們看完了這部片子之後，是不能够像讀完了小林多奇二的「蟹工船」一樣的蓬勃地引起一種統制了的組織了的意識和感情？不幸得很，回答是否定的。</p>
<p>在這兒，所有的是各種各樣的恐怖和雜然的憤激和爆發，在這種憤激和爆發之後，對於應該如何處理的態度，在這兒是表示得很暖昧的。</p>
<p>我們還不知道ＨｅｌｌｓＨｉｇｈｗａｙ是怎樣的作品，但是，卽使是在暴露非人道的監獄，祇要它根本上是美國影片，是一種商品，那就不能有更多的期待。不過，在美國現在的電影界現狀之下，在那些低級的所謂Ｇａｎｇｓｔｅｒ影片還是陸續地出現的時候，能够生產這種性質的可怕的暴露作品，已經不能不説是美國電影史上値得大軍特書的一件事了。</p>
<h3>影片談評評「影城艷史」</h3>
<p>— 滄桑</p>
<p>“ＧｏｉｎｇＨｏｌｌｙｗｏｏｄ”大光明好來塢！好來塢！它在黃金世界的美國自成神秘的一角：在一般男女們的憧憬中，它似乎是多麽可以艷羨的塲所！此其間有美女如雲的秀色，有風糜一時的爵士歌樂，有朝秦暮楚的羅曼斯－一切所謂音樂，生命，戀愛，似乎俯拾卽是了。然而實際上，生息於好萊塢的男女們眞的享盡人問幸福嗎？這部描寫好萊塢生活的「影城艷史」便揭示了内容。</p>
<p>自從世界商業蕭條的狂瀾波及了這個紙醉金迷的好萊塢，集中在美國的男女電影明星遂紛紛作鳥獸散，好萊塢大有總崩潰的危險。這部「影城艷史」的原名呌做“ＧｏｉｎｇＨｏｌｌｙｗｏｏｄ”我們顧名思義，更檢討影片的内容，可知美國的電影界正在竭力想法子要振作人心，要復興好萊塢吧。至於結果如何，卽在這部影片所標示的答案也還是一個疑問。</p>
<p>好萊塢的長處和短處，在這部影片裏都可以看到。論内容，它同其他一般的歌舞片是一樣的空虚和牽强，例如其中叙述戀愛故事是多麽的不自然，結果便是使人看了絲毫不覺得有何感動。這或者就是好萊塢的羅曼斯的眞相了，論技術，它實在能表現美國物質文明的優點，因之導演的手法，影頭的靈活奇巧，和收音的淸晰，無往而不顯出好萊塢的特長。</p>
<p>曼琳黛維熊飾女敎員而追慕音樂，生命和戀愛，表演顯有優劣。影片的開頭幾幕欠生動，她扮女敎員的表演平淡無奇。待她到了好萊塢之後，她由呆板一變而玲瓏活潑，這或者輕佻的歌舞動作是她善長，因此而有前後絶然不同的成績。平克勞斯裴的幾次歌唱還很動聽，不過他的動作受了好萊塢的俚俗的環境的影響，因之雖則竭力要做作大藝術家的身分，却遠不及「春江花月夜」裏的傑克蒲拉哉「羅京管樂」裏的伏爾庇了。這點又證明美洲的Ｊａｚｚｙ歌樂與歐洲的Ｃｌａｓｓｉｃａｌ歌樂的不同，實在不能同日而語了。</p>
<p>這部影片背影的富麗華貴也是描寫好萊塢生活的應有文章。曼琳黛維絲將來入好萊塢的當兒，横臥床縟，幻想起她同她所單戀着的歌家在一塊的幾幕羅曼底克的畫面幽美到了極點，不過這些一切夢裏情景反映出好萊塢的空虚，向這「空虚」兩字，劇中人曾經一再的道出，也就是好萊塢復興的答案吧？</p>
<h3>評「舊夢重温」“ＣｈｉｌｄＯｆＭａｕｂａｔｔａｎ”－南京映</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>有前進的作家，自然也有沒落的作家；有「意識嚴重」（？）的，壯烈的，暴露的影片，自然也有麻醉而歌頌統治者的欺騙的影片，在這個社會制度還沒澈底的改造之前，這錯綜的，矛盾的一切是不可避免的。</p>
<p>「亡命者」的原作者勞勃脱白恩是親身嘗受到了統治者對待奴隸們毒辣的欺騙的手腕，他親身體騐到了這現實社會的黑暗和殘酷。終於他吐露出那慘痛的心的哀號。</p>
<p>而「舊夢重溫」的原作者潑利斯登司德其、他永遠沒有勇氣睜開眼睛來看一看現實，他永遠永遠地閉着眼睛來爲上層社會「歌功頌德」。　　不信，且看一看他所告訴我們的是什麽？「我們的」富绅保羅因了視察他的產業而認識了在其產業内的一家跳舞塲的舞女。那位舞女自然因了姿色秀麗，舞藝超衆而打動了我們的富紳的心。於是乎保羅「一往情深」而女亦爲之心動。憑了自己的財富，終於和她同居。然而爲了劇情太簡單，我們的作家便來了一個曲折。在她的孩子死後，她誤會他的愛是單爲了小孩子的緣故，於是她竟不别而行，到墨西哥和他離婚。然而，我們這位富绅保羅雖然在和她秘密結婚的時候，叮囑她不可外揚，恐於身家名譽攸關，但他是眞心愛她的，於是旣經發覺，她的前情人也自願犧牲一切，於是我們的富紳便和我們的無女「舊夢重溫」。</p>
<p>看呵！我們的富紳是這樣的溫柔，多情哪！</p>
<p>爲統治者歌功頌德，替上層社會掩護，解釋，來欺騙觀衆，這就是沒落作家的本色。　　然而，鐵一樣的事實擺在我們的面前，有多少的富翁是用金錢來玩弄女性，摧殘女性，玩過了，丢棄丁，這是在現實社會裏的普遍的現象，卽使「火柴大王」的編劇者也不曾和不能把這個事實掩護。</p>
<p>所以，「舊夢重溫」除了告訴我們一個庸俗的千篇一律的空虚的戀愛故事外、還替我們的富紳盡了欺朦觀衆的任務。</p>
<p>當然，像美國的其他戀愛故事的影片一樣，「舊夢重溫」的演出是輕快，簡潔，淸順的。表演自以南珊卡洛，約翰鮑爾斯爲最佳，特别是在舞塲裏的幾個塲面。</p>
<h3>「小婦人」中的四姊妹，不久在大上海放映。</h3>
<h3>關於小婦人銀幕上的空前奇蹟</h3>
<p>— 百足</p>
<p>小婦人是寫一段十九世紀一個家庭熱烈纒綿的故事。在這裏面所看到的是恬靜忠實的人生觀，軟性暗示的戀愛觀；眞摯熱情的倫理，敦厚淳樸的友情；過慣白熱化生活的人們，無疑地感到」種親切有味的咀嚼，這種味兒不單在小説上藴蓄着，就在不久開映的小婦人電影裏也相信可能的保留着。</p>
<p>這部書曾經在一九一二年出演在舞台上。第二次，在倫敦出演，是一九一九年。可是到了一九三三年，雷電華公司費了我量的心血，攝成了一部純文藝的電影，這不得不佩服它有偉大的膽魄，在整個電影前進的途轍上刻劃甚深的巨人足跡。這眞是銀幕上空前的奇蹟。</p>
<p>該片主演人凱絲玲赫本湼在小婦人裏，她的演出有特殊的造就，十足顯示她的充分了解及融合劇中人的個性，而導演喬治古格的聰明手法，使她獲得更密切合作的機會。所以當她攝製「小婦人」後，她説：「我研究了六個月的充裕時間，對於這角兒的認識。當開麥末在我搖動的時候，我彷彿就是書中人「嬌」，她的遭遇就是我的遭遇，我和她是打成了一片。就是導演古格先生在工作的時候，也從來沒有一次分過心，他也像我變成了書中人「嬌」一樣啊！」</p>
<p>小婦人在世界文壇上，果然擁着甚廣大的讀者，但在中國，却也有着同樣的命運。在文藝界上有相當素養的人們，誰都知道這「小婦人」的文學名著。單只中國譯本就有兩種，一種是呌「小婦人」，一種是呌「四姊妹」。讀過這譯本的現在更可有參考的機會，我們可在戲院銀幕上看到小婦人的活動了。</p>
<p>在寂寞的銀壇裏，小婦人是够我們的注意</p>
<p>與欣喜啊！</p>

<h3>Chai Mountain Goes to Taiyuan, Claiming It's a Sightseeing Trip; Japanese and Puppet Troops Fill Malanyu</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops at Heidazi Camp, Qingfengtuo, Xifengyan, etc., in eastern Chahar continue to increase. Seven Japanese planes are stationed at Heidazi Camp, conducting reconnaissance over Chicheng and Guyuan daily, causing public panic. Over a thousand puppet troops of Li Shou-hsin stationed outside Guyuan ancient city are supplied with military provisions and sustenance by the Japanese. Japanese spies are active in Guyuan County every day, using money to entice the ignorant. Song Zheyuan has been continuously meeting with Qin Dechun, Zhang Weifan, Feng Zhian, etc., to discuss solutions, but the date for an inspection tour is yet to be determined. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a private report from a certain agency in Tianjin, Japanese and puppet troops fill the streets of Malanyu. Over a hundred Japanese ronin are stationed in Xinglong County, and over two hundred puppet troops in yellow uniforms are stationed in vacant rooms of various agencies. Han traitors are very active, establishing Japanese language schools for both men and women under Japanese orders, with 120 male students and 80 female students. Furthermore, all fifty-plus businesses in the county have now closed down, but the number of Japanese businesses is gradually increasing. Only gold notes and four hundred copper coins are circulating in the market, the situation is extremely bleak. (Eighth Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chai Mountain left for Taiyuan at 11 PM on the eighth. According to reports, this trip is for sightseeing, not to visit Yan Xishan. He will stay for a day or two before going to Datong to tour the Yungang Grottoes and return to Beiping within a week. Malanyu has not been returned because Chinese with rights are currently mining gold there. To protect this historically significant place, the return has been temporarily delayed. Once negotiations with the Chinese side result in a ban on mining, the area will naturally be returned, but the date is yet to be determined. The withdrawal of the puppet police is only a matter of time. Once suitable housing is found outside the pass, they will certainly withdraw. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a report from Yu, Japanese and Korean ronin are selling drugs rampantly in the Yuqin area. Despite repeated negotiations by our side, the Japanese have always been evasive. Huo Shi returned to Beiping from Gubeikou at 5 PM on the eighth. According to reports, order in Gubeikou is gradually being restored. Although the Japanese army is being transferred from time to time, there have been no increases. Regarding the withdrawal of puppet police, Matsui stated that they are currently seeking housing and that the withdrawal should be possible by the end of this month at the latest. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng stated that he discussed the reception of Malanyu and the withdrawal of puppet police during his visit to Chai Mountain. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the situation in eastern Luan seems quite calm at present. Although the future of North China is concerning, it is not as serious as rumors suggest. The various propaganda efforts of the Japanese aim to confuse public opinion and benefit from it. Our North China authorities are adhering to the established policy of the central government and absolutely do not recognize puppet organizations. As for what Japan seeks, the government will likely base its response on the following principles: only Chinese vehicles can operate within Chinese territory, and only the methods stipulated by international postal services can be used for postal services in China. The Chinese government will find it difficult to compromise on these principles. It is also understood that the reporting mission undertaken by Huang Fu on this trip south is primarily focused on this point. The degree of tension or relaxation in the future situation in North China will depend on the progress of this matter. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Shengwu, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to Shandong to oversee the selection of students to study in Europe. He returned to Nanjing on the eighth after completing his duties. When asked about the situation in North China, Li said that he was not fully aware as he had not been to Beiping. However, the Japanese and puppet's ambitions to invade China have been long-standing, not just starting today. Recent reports indicate that the Japanese are increasing troops in various ports, as a further threat, which is within our expectations. The central government is now coordinating a response and will not allow them to do as they please. If the various recent rumors regarding North China can be handled properly, it may be possible to maintain the current peace, otherwise, it will be difficult to say. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Flies to Jiangxi Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, He Spoke at the Lishi Society on the True Meaning of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei was originally scheduled to fly to Jiangxi on the eighth to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to discuss foreign affairs and other issues, but he was unable to do so due to an invitation from the Lishi Society to speak on the true meaning of the New Life Movement. He has now scheduled to fly there on a Ford plane on the morning of the ninth, and will stay in Jiangxi for about two days before returning to Nanjing with Huang Fu. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei delivered a speech at the Lishi Society on the afternoon of the eighth at the invitation of the Society on the true meaning of the New Life Movement. He first said that in order to save the nation from disaster and shoulder the responsibility of revolution, it is necessary to be loving, united, and sincere. In order to achieve unity and sincerity, the people of the whole country should first have the same thought and consistent action, what is called must be organized and disciplined, and then they can seek progress together in a common life. Secondly, he said that the true meaning of the New Life Movement is to enable the entire nation to be organized and disciplined, cultivated and trained, to shoulder the heavy task of the national revolution and save the nation from disaster. He also said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in a telegram yesterday that the things that should be done first in the New Life Movement now, the things that should be done from a small perspective, are order and cleanliness. Some may say that these are trivial matters, why should we care? However, we must know that China's (casual attitude), and the reclusive scholar's unkempt appearance and delousing while talking, and the hypocritical school's overcorrection and being harsh on others, have created today's chaotic, loose, lax, and filthy society. The demise of the Song and Ming dynasties can serve as a warning. Finally, he said that in implementing the New Life Movement, each individual should hold the view of restraining themselves for the sake of the public. If the power of social sanctions is increased, the effect will be greater than in any other aspect. It can be asserted. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Huang Fu Visits Chiang Kai-shek for Several Days</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Huang Fu has visited Chiang Kai-shek for several days, reporting in detail on the situation in North China. Huang is scheduled to go to Nanjing on the ninth and then to Shanghai before returning to his hometown. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

Telegraph and telephone lines between Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan have been opened. The communication line between Shanhaiguan and Tianjin is still pending negotiations between Tao Shangming and the Japanese, so there is no definite date for reporting and talking.

After Sun Changsheng's forces surrendered their weapons at Sanshenggong, the first batch of unarmed troops, about twelve or thirteen, may arrive in Baotou, and the inspection and reorganization will begin before the fifteenth. The reorganization funds have been remitted. The two brigades, Lu Fengnian and Yu Shiming, will be stationed in the western suburbs of Beiping for training and then sent to Baoding.

<p>Order in the Tangshan Mining Area Gradually Restored</p>
<h3>More Than Half of the Internal Workers Receive Lamps and Go Down the Mine; Zhao Lei is Reprimanded for Requesting Funds on Behalf of Zhao Dazhong; Linxi and Other Three Mines Receive No Assistance At All; Zhao Dazhong, Relying on His Power, Declares That He Will Not Leave Tangshan; The Organizational Regulations of the Luan Yu Area Labor-Capital Affairs Supervision Office Have Been Promulgated</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Asami, the Japanese garrison commander in Tangshan, indicated to Zhu Shiqin that it is acceptable for Chinese officials to arrest Zhao Dazhong, but if Tangshan's security is disrupted due to Zhao's arrest, the Japanese army cannot ignore it, implying that he is openly protecting Zhao and will not allow us to do anything to Zhao Dazhong. As a result, Zhu Shiqin has not left yet and is still negotiating with the Japanese. The Hebei Provincial Government ordered Tao Shangming and Zhao Xun to resolve the labor strike within three days and arrest Zhao Dazhong and bring him to the province. Tao and Zhao did not dare to do so quickly because they were afraid of the Japanese. Zhao Dazhong, relying on the Japanese influence, declared to the outside world that he would never leave Tangshan. It is very difficult to resolve this matter. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than half of the internal workers of Kailuan Tang Mine received lamps and returned to work on the eighth, and order in the mining area has largely been restored. Some of the striking workers have also returned to work. Seeing that the workers are experiencing a life crisis, the contractors took the opportunity to persuade the workers to return to work. The Hebei Provincial Government received a telegram from Zhao Lei, the commander of the war zone security team, requesting 20,000 yuan in cash for Zhao Dazhong to borrow for leaving Tangshan. The provincial government replied with a reprimand because it was excessive. Zhao Dazhong still refuses to leave Tangshan. However, the war zone cart driver union and the war zone rickshaw puller union, which were manipulated by Zhao, have dissolved because Zhao has not appeared. On the evening of the seventh, Zhao Dazhong sent his henchmen Ma Deliang and Zhang Zhenfu to invite workers to Zhao Lei's house for a meeting, but few responded. The striking workers of Tang Mine have used up the two yuan in wages they borrowed from the contractors. The mine announced that it would not resume before Wednesday next week, but would dismiss and rehire, so many workers are panicked. It is expected that a large number of workers will return to work on the ninth. The three representatives sent by Zhao Dazhong to receive the trade unions in Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, and Majiagou mines, You Haidong, Cheng Pengfei, and Li Guodong, You Haidong was killed by workers in Zhaogezhuang, and Cheng Pengfei and Li are missing. The striking workers of Tang Mine see that the Dongsi Mine is completely confrontational and receives no assistance, so they dare not advocate expanding the labor strike any further. (Eighth Day)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Luan Yu Area Labor-Capital Affairs Supervision Office has chosen to establish itself at the Tangshan Guangdong Street Trade Union. It will formally commence operations after the Tang Mine turmoil is resolved.

Tao Shangming concurrently serves as the director of the General Affairs Section, Zhao Xun concurrently serves as the director of the Security Section, and Li Yinchun concurrently serves as the director of the Mediation Section.

<h3>Two Airplanes Reconnoiter the Traces of Liu's Bandits</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Xu Kangliang and three bombers departed to the front line in two aircraft on the morning of the eighth to reconnoiter Liu's bandits. Aircraft No. 65 inspected the area of Linyi, Juxian, Yishui, and found no traces of bandits. Many bridges and culverts on the Linyi highway were destroyed. Three Shandong aircraft were parked outside the city. Aircraft No. 66 inspected the area of Tancheng, Cangshan, Ganyu, and also found no traces of bandits. The villages are quiet, and Ganyu City is very desolate. Based on this, it is judged that the bandits have indeed fled back to Mengshan. When flying over Xinpu, a report was thrown to Wang Jun in a communication bag. Returned to Xuzhou at noon. It is decided to fly to Mengshan for reconnaissance on the ninth.

The bandits fled along the Wen River to Shuiwangzhuang and Yaojiadianzi, thirty miles southwest of Yishui City, where they were severely attacked by Li Xiangchen's brigade from the heights of Daling Mountain. The fighting was fierce. Gunfire could be heard in Yishui City and did not stop until late at night. The bandits fled north to the Xiagaozhuang area, twenty miles west of Yishui City, in a very embarrassed state. Division commanders Sun Tongmeng and Gu Liangmin, leading Zhang Shulin and Li Xiangchen, with Li Jiade's cavalry regiment and Xie Shuxian's militia, encircled the bandits. The attack can be started tonight. The bandits are still trying to flee north. Aircraft took off from Linyi to drop bombs, killing many bandits. Their old lair, the dangerous caves in Mengshan, have been destroyed, and the masses have long been evacuated, so the bandits no longer dare to flee into them. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Exposing Germany's Alleged Recognition of the Puppet State of Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Just as our country's authorities have stated, the non-recognition of puppet organizations by European and American nations has long been an ironclad rule of international morality. Anyone who violates this ironclad rule will damage their nation's character. However, rumors of recognition of the puppet organization, which were once widely publicized a month ago, still linger like faint music, seemingly 끊어질 듯 이어질 듯. In particular, the talk of collusion between Germany and Japan to recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo is rumored to have some slight evidence to support it. Therefore, we must earnestly advise our friendly nation, Germany, both its government and its people. Japan, disregarding the world's disapproval, single-handedly created the puppet organization. Looking around the world, it finds few allies. Therefore, it becomes frustrated and angry, withdrawing from the League of Nations to show its determination and leave room for arbitrary and reckless actions. However, after withdrawing, it is still afraid of isolation. Therefore, it resorts to cunning tricks to win over others. Germany, disappointed by its demands for military disarmament and equality, also declared its withdrawal from the League of Nations. Japan considers this a shared difficulty and expresses its enthusiasm, which is within expectations. However, for Germany's sake, it would be unfortunate to follow in the footsteps of the puppet state of Manchukuo and become a Japanese puppet. It would not be worth it.</p>
<p>Germany is deeply pained by the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles. Even fair-minded people in the Entente countries express sympathy. When Germany withdrew from the League of Nations over the issue of military disarmament and equality, world public opinion still tried to understand its position. The motives for Japan and Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations are completely different: one is to facilitate aggression, and the other is to implement self-defense. The world's judgment also differs accordingly. Moreover, according to the current situation, the key to Germany's return to the international community lies in military disarmament. Although the disarmament talks among the powers are full of intrigue,迂迥曲折, they will not dare to abandon them before the outbreak of the next world war. Therefore, as long as the war does not break out, disarmament talks will continue to exist, and Germany's return to the League of Nations will always have a possibility of realization. This is also completely different from Japan's position.</p>
<p>Some may say that the potential collusion between Germany and Japan lies in their shared opposition to Russia. However, is there a reason for conflict between Russia and Germany? This is doubtful. Since the National Socialist Party came to power, the ideologies advocated by Germany and Russia have been as incompatible as ice and charcoal. The foreign policies they have adopted also differ in terms of maintaining or not maintaining the status quo. However, there is no denying that the relations between the two countries have not reached the point of irreconcilable hostility. Since Hitler came to power, his imagined encirclement has become increasingly strict. Soviet Russia has concluded non-aggression treaties with its western neighbors, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Even if Germany wants to turn against Russia, it must first destroy this buffer zone. Whether Germany has the strength to achieve this today is questionable. I fear that before the eastern expeditionary force takes a single step across the border, the Allied forces of France and Belgium will threaten its rear. Moreover, the Bolshevik government of Russia was the first to negotiate peace with Germany before the end of the European War. After the war, Russia lost no less territory than Germany. Germany has never ceded an inch of land to Russia. Therefore, considering the circumstances, it cannot be said that there is a reason for conflict between Germany and Russia. Since Soviet Russia has adopted a policy of maintaining the status quo, what does Germany have to fear from Soviet Russia? If the animosity between Fascism and Communism is seen as inevitably leading to a direct conflict between Germany and Russia, it is an oversimplified conclusion in the complex international situation. Therefore, we deeply believe that Hitler's anti-communism is more of a demonstration against Moscow and a means of maintaining his domestic dictatorship. In short, there is no reason for conflict between Germany and Russia. The intelligent Germans must be aware of this. We are hesitant to believe that they would be willing to collude with Japan under the banner of a common opposition to Russia and recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo.</p>
<p>Some may also say that the trade between China and Germany is not as prosperous as that between Japan and Germany. Germans will weigh the importance of commercial interests and naturally favor Japan and neglect China. This argument is shallow and ridiculous and not worth refuting. With China's vast territory and large population, which world market can compare to ours in the future? Moreover, at a time when the whole country is striving for material construction, the demand for machinery and machine products is immense. Germany is known for its excellent craftsmanship. After the European War, it concluded equal treaties with us. The feelings between the Chinese and German people have become even stronger. Although we dare not say that the sales of German machinery and machine products in China will surpass those of other countries, it is almost certain that they will at least be on par. On the other hand, Japan has gradually moved from an agricultural country to an industrial country. There is no guarantee that the sales of German goods in Japan will gradually increase. The intelligent Germans must be aware of this. We are hesitant to believe that they would focus on the limited trade surplus and collude with Japan to recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo.</p>
<p>Some may also say that shortly after Hitler came to power, he made a public statement about restoring old colonies. Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it has continued to hold its mandated territories north of the equator in the Pacific. These mandated territories were formerly German territories before the war. The Japanese may even use this as bait to win over the Germans and consider them as allies. This is also possible. However, it is unclear whether Japan, as a non-member of the League of Nations, can continue to hold the mandated territories entrusted by the League of Nations. In terms of legal principles, this is already far-fetched. If the mandated territories are regarded as private property and given away, how can this be justified? The League of Nations and the United States cannot stand idly by and remain silent. First, Japan is planning to take action in the Pacific. The aforementioned mandated territories have military value. Japan will certainly not give them away. Second, Germany's naval power today is insignificant. Even if it can restore a few isolated coral reefs overseas, what good will it do in the competition for maritime hegemony? Third, if this is seen as a beginning to restore the old view of pre-war colonies, then England, France, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand will all bear the brunt. The more enemies Germany makes, the more difficult it will be to succeed. Fourth, if the Germans are too enthusiastic about their demands for the restoration of colonies, it will affect their position on military equality. Fifth, all of the above are facts. The intelligent Germans must be aware of this. We are hesitant to believe that they would be deceived by small gains and collude with Japan to recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo. The reasons for speculation about collusion between Germany and Japan are nothing more than these. However, after careful consideration, we feel that they are not credible. Therefore, we can conclude that the rumors of collusion between Germany and Japan to recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo are fabricated by certain parties to achieve their own ends, without waiting for repeated formal denials from the German side. Moreover, when the League of Nations passed a resolution not to recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo, Germany was a member of the League of Nations and voted in favor of it. Even if it later expressed its intention to withdraw, it must still bear its unfinished obligations and has no room for evasion. Since the National Socialist Party came to power, the world's attitude towards Germany has changed somewhat. This is an undeniable fact. For the sake of the German government and people, they should strive to restore the sympathy of the people of the world. If they do not do this and recklessly try to be strange and eye-catching, using the sensationalism of the world as their ability, then the counterattack will only be suffered by Germany itself. We certainly do not want to regard Germany's current ruling authorities as another Kaiser Wilhelm II. However, we must sincerely advise those who are intent on acting arbitrarily and disregarding public opinion. The terrible impression of the European War is still vivid in our minds. We must learn from this lesson and not allow the peace that the world is yearning for to be destroyed by our own actions or to increase the power of destruction through our hands. Today, both China and Germany are oppressed nations, suffering from the shackles of treaties and the pain of territorial loss. We always express our infinite sympathy for the hardships experienced by the people of our friendly nation, Germany. What we hope to repay to the people of Germany is only sympathy. We firmly believe that we will not be disappointed.</p>
<h3>Trends in the US Silver Bill</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas stated that the Dess Silver Bill, which advocates authorizing the Treasury Department to purchase silver imported into the United States at a price 25% higher than the market price to offset surplus American agricultural products, will be favorably reviewed by the Senate Monetary Committee on Monday. This bill will make silver nationalized because domestic production will be purchased by the government, and speculators' hoards will also be nationalized. It is estimated that there are approximately 200 to 300 million ounces of silver hoarded. This bill contains an amendment proposed by Thomas, which advocates that the United States purchase silver without limitation at world market prices and issue silver certificates backed by its silver holdings until American prices reach the 1926 level.

<p>The World on the Telephone</p>
<h3>Cities in 52 Countries Can Now Be Reached by Telephone, But China and Japan Are Not Yet Connected; the US-Japan Line Is Currently in Progress</h3>
<p>(Washington) The ideal of global telephone communication is now nearing realization. The voices of people can reach any important city on the ring connection. This project is scheduled to be presented at the upcoming 59th anniversary convention of engineers for the first discussion of radio wave transmission. It has been verified that with the telephone network completed on Earth, people in the United States can talk to people in the Pacific and Manila. They can also pass through the Atlantic to Amsterdam, Berlin, or Brussels. They can also connect with Manila. However, major projects still need to be built between Tokyo and Shanghai and the major stations in the United States to allow all major ports to connect with each other. According to the engineer in charge here, the telephone line from the United States to Japan has been lost before, and is now being rushed to be configured, and can be completed in the next two or three months, at the latest by the end of this year. According to the transportation expert of the Ministry of Commerce, Stanley Seith, the telephone between the United States and Japan has been tested for a year and will soon be ready for application. In the past twelve months, the United States has been able to use telephones to communicate to Russia, Venezuela, Manila, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. Before, they could also make phone calls to countries in Europe, South America, and Africa. According to the telephone directory, telephone users in this city only need to pay the prescribed fee to be able to call Siam, Sumatra, Batavia, Bombay, Cairo, Kahestun, Jiutai (Morocco), Honolulu, Montevia, Bonoseller, Riga, Xeni (Australia), and many cities in the world. Among the fifty-two countries, telephones can be used to communicate with each other, only China and Japan are not connected. The US-Japan line is currently in progress, and Japan to Java is for transfer to Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Between Manila and Bandoon, a phone line has already been connected. According to this plan, which started in 1876, there are now 33 million telephones that can communicate with the world, of which the United States accounts for 17 million. It is also verified that 92% of the world's telephones can communicate with each other. If the telephone lines in the United States are connected into a single line, it can circle the earth 2,400 times. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>

<p>St. Paul, Minnesota: Minnesota Labor and Agriculture Director Arson tonight ordered an investigation into the report received by the authorities after the riot of 5,000 unemployed workers in front of the Minneapolis City Hall yesterday. According to the report, the Communist Party participated in and took on the role of command in this riot. According to the police report, when the rioters rushed into the City Hall, several famous Communist Party members, who were the leaders, encouraged the demonstrators to throw stones into the City Hall from the windows. Afterwards, the police arrived and clashed with the rioters. As a result, the number of rioters arrested reached 30, and more than a dozen others were sent to the hospital due to injuries. The police firmly believe that the Communist Party's purpose is to take advantage of the suspension of public works as a means of attracting unemployed workers to join the Communist Party, because the Public Works Administration has made thousands of workers unemployed due to the suspension of work. The riot that occurred yesterday was extremely serious. The demonstrators refused to leave, so the police were forced to use tear gas and water dragons to disperse them.

<h3>Colombia-Peru War Machine Not Gone</h3>
<p>Since the news that the Republics of Colombia and Peru have continued the war has reached this place today, the diplomatic aspects have been greatly shaken. The dispute between Colombia and Peru over the small town of Leticia is the main reason for the break in relations between the two countries, and the dispute between the two countries over this city has not happened overnight. Leticia originally belonged to Colombia, but has recently been taken over by the League of Nations. However, today the Colombian government resolutely opposes the continued trusteeship of the League of Nations, and claims that the League of Nations must return the city to Colombia by June 23 at the latest. However, others say that Peru is unwilling to hand over this city unconditionally from the hands of the League of Nations to Colombia, because the situation there is extremely important. Therefore, in the next two months, if there is no appropriate solution, the war machine between Colombia and Peru is likely to continue to occur. Political circles firmly believe that the League of Nations' failure to mediate the Boba War has exposed the League of Nations' inability to manage the various countries in South America, and the current dispute between Colombia and Peru is also affected by it. The reason why the League of Nations took over the city was because the Peruvian people were inflicting violence on the city. On September 1, 1932, the Peruvian people formed a team and occupied the city by force. Although the Peruvian government did not know about it in advance, when Colombia protested to it, it instead protected the Peruvian rioters who invaded the area. The Colombian government then sent gunboats as a step to regain the city. Afterwards, Colombia also filed a complaint with the League of Nations for public judgment. The League of Nations then suggested withdrawing the Peruvian rioters in the area and establishing a three-person committee to take over the area. Therefore, the city has become a neutral place since then. However, the League of Nations' handling of the city has not yet satisfied Colombia and Peru. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Court Rules US Fugitive Can Be Extradited</h3>
<p>Insol's lawyer filed an appeal (Washington) The US government today sent a warrant signed by President Luo to the Turkish government by telegram, and appointed Mr. Pei, the US Consul in Istanbul, as the escort to bring Insol back to the United States. This is the first step for the United States to extradite Insol. It is expected that Insol will be deported in the middle of next week. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey: After questioning the American fugitive Insol here on the 2nd of this month, the court made a ruling in accordance with the prosecutor's conclusion, approving extradition. The final ruling was approved by the Cabinet. In this way, the United States' request for the extradition of Insol has been accepted by the Turkish government. However, extradition has not been carried out until today. At the beginning, the United States government firmly sought extradition from the Turkish government. However, the Turkish government has already agreed, but the US government is not in a hurry to arrest him. The police officers sent to Turkey to escort Insol back to the country have not yet arrived. The situation is quite strange and generally considered to be strange. Insol's lawyers plan to file an appeal soon, requesting the cancellation of the Istanbul court's decision to allow extradition. The location of Insol's temporary detention is yet to be determined. Insol's lawyer, Ahmed, said that according to Article 57 of the Turkish Judicial Organization Law, only a court decision has legal effect in such cases, and cannot be issued by an administrative decision. The lawyer said that the Istanbul court's ruling was illegal. Insol also formally declared that he was a pure British Anglican, not a Jew, so he was under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. However, it is currently unknown what effect this protest will have. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>French Civil Servants Oppose Salary Cuts; Large Number of Postal Workers Demonstrate</h3>
<p>(Paris) Recently, in order to balance the budget, the government intends to cut the salaries of civil servants and postal workers, which has caused several demonstrations against the Dumaiger cabinet. Today, extremists led a large number of postal workers to gather in the square of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, singing the Internationale and insulting the government. However, most of those present seemed to oppose undisciplined actions. In addition to verbally expressing their dissatisfaction, there were no disturbances. Civil servants are now preparing for the National Federation of Civil Servants to meet tomorrow. The association will consider the attitude to take to deal with the government. Among them, there are radicals who advocate announcing a general strike on May 1 until the government cancels the salary reduction plan. However, the association seems unlikely to take this harsh step. It will probably hold a national meeting or stop work for a few minutes to express its protest. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

Villagers Peng Shaogang, Yang Guoji, and others formed a petition association to appeal to the county government and superiors for exemption. Peng Yang was suddenly detained by the county government a few days ago. Dapu fellow villagers' associations in Chaozhou, Shantou, and Guangdong and various groups in the county rose up to rescue them. The province has agreed to release them. The villagers plan to expand the organization for exemption in order to achieve their goals. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Another Political Crisis in Japan: Saito Cabinet Loses Its Way, Seiyukai's Attitude Hardens</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of Prime Minister Saito's upcoming visit to Duke Saionji, a meeting of the three elders was convened, and it was decided to maintain the status quo, attempting to extend the cabinet's lifespan and prepare for action. For the candidate for Minister of Education, it was originally planned to appoint Mr. Horikiri, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Finance, but he firmly declined, resulting in failure. Recently, it was also planned to temporarily shelve the candidate issue and move toward newer policies, and to vigorously explain the policy direction at the regular cabinet meeting on the 10th, requesting the understanding of cabinet members in order to overcome the current difficult situation and encourage them to rise to the occasion. Although the three elders agreed on the idea of actively refreshing policies, some people in the political world harbor dissatisfaction with the group's attitude and are already planning a vigorous movement to overthrow the cabinet. In particular, a certain major event currently underway provides them with an opportunity to exploit, and it is even possible that they could overthrow the cabinet in one fell swoop. They are currently busy devising strategies and are extremely active. It is difficult to maintain the status quo of the cabinet given how the situation is developing, and the future of the political situation is feared to be not optimistic. (8th, Japanese Allied News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) How Prime Minister Saito's second attempt to fill the Minister of Education position will proceed is highly noteworthy. Although the Prime Minister says he will proceed slowly at this time, the current situation does not allow the cabinet to remain constantly uneasy. If it continues in this way, it will only alienate people. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito will eventually negotiate with Tosome Uesawa, Yosaburo Takekoshi, and Dr. Sanzō Mikami of the House of Peers, requesting them to join the cabinet. However, with the government and the Seiyukai in a state of disconnection, Uesawa and Takekoshi also have reservations, and even Dr. Mikami may not easily agree. In short, after returning to Tokyo on the morning of the 9th, Prime Minister Saito will meet with Finance Minister Takahashi and Navy Minister Yamamoto to discuss the situation. At that time, either a reorganization of the cabinet will actually be implemented, or the Minister of Education will be temporarily filled to gloss over the situation. This is quite noteworthy. (8th, Den-tsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese political situation has once again caused turmoil due to the Minister of Education replacement issue. The House of Peers' observation on the future of the political situation is as follows: if the Minister of Education issue can be easily resolved while the Saito Cabinet is still strong, its current weakened state is bound to result in a difficult birth, proving that the cabinet is in the process of collapsing. Prime Minister Saito did not replace the Minister of Education before visiting Saionji, presumably because he intended to resign. Afterwards, his mind changed, and he decided to maintain the status quo, but the first attempt ended in failure, damaging the cabinet's prestige. Therefore, no matter what strategy is adopted in the future, it is feared that the problem cannot be fundamentally solved. From now on, the successor to the Minister of Education will naturally negotiate with the Seiyukai, but negotiating with individuals is very difficult. Therefore, the government will temporarily observe the situation and seek a second-best strategy. Even if a certain person is obtained, the situation has already reached this point, and the future is full of difficulties. However, in view of the issue of discipline and order, as well as the talk of Prince Konoe forming a cabinet and the development of the political party cooperation movement, the future of the Saito Cabinet is still not optimistic. (8th, Den-tsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, because the government even began direct negotiations with Mr. Zenbei Horikiri regarding the candidate for Minister of Education, the general sentiment within the Seiyukai suddenly hardened. At the same time, the party's executives are carefully studying countermeasures to deal with this new situation in order to determine the party's policy. What we have heard is roughly as follows: (1) The government's attitude towards the Seiyukai is not benevolent, which is tantamount to expressing that the Seiyukai is not trustworthy. From now on, we should not consider our relationship with the government. Regardless of any issue, we should advance towards a policy-oriented approach based on strict principles of right and wrong. We must be prepared for the political changes that are expected recently. (2) Regarding rice policies, if a special session of the Diet is convened, the Seiyukai will submit a rice policy bill in advance. If there are discrepancies with the government's proposed plan, we are determined to openly declare war on the government. Even if our party is dissolved, we must uphold our主張. (3) If a special session of the Diet is not convened, there is still a chance to seize the opportunity when political changes arrive. Therefore, the Seiyukai should establish new policies based on the lives of the people in preparation, and should make further efforts to restore the credibility of political parties in the future. The above is the focus of the Seiyukai. From now on, we will pay close attention to the government's attitude and the development of the political situation, and we will not allow the party's actions to be negligent.

<h3>Disarmament Conference Scheduled to Open: US Government Issues Statement, Declines to Participate in Sanctions Convention</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Barthou held lengthy talks with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson today. It is reported that it has been decided to convene the Disarmament General Committee on May 23rd. Recently, it has been widely rumored that the committee would convene on April 23rd. The reasons for this postponement are threefold: (1) to allow Britain and France to continue discussing security issues; (2) to allow Barthou to consult with Poland and the Little Entente countries, as Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu will arrive in Paris soon, and Barthou will also go to Warsaw and Prague at the end of this month; and (3) to allow for a leisurely arrangement of everything. Henderson is now heading to Geneva to chair the Disarmament Steering Committee meeting on Tuesday. US Secretary of State Hull issued a statement in Washington today, stating that the United States has not formally promised to take any action to sanction those who violate any disarmament convention. He also stated that Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, is still on vacation and has not been ordered to make any promises. (7th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Political Circles Satisfied with French Note: Disarmament Negotiations Enter New Stage</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the French government's reply to the British memorandum expresses its willingness to exchange views with Britain and conclude a convention in which Germany's demands for military armament can be recognized, but this armament must be limited, and this limitation must be based on complete international management and monitoring. This management and monitoring also apply to other signatory countries. After the above news was announced here today, the hope for the establishment of a disarmament convention was revived. It is reported that the French government welcomes the British government to discuss the implementation of security issues again. The French government promises to answer the British questions in detail in Geneva, but in view of the Geneva meeting on Tuesday, it is suggested to continue the discussions between Britain and France. It is reported that the most recent impact of the French reply is that it may be possible to study the conclusion of a convention limited to Europe in order to stabilize the arms issue within a designated range. This agreement can include the entirety of Europe, including Soviet Russia. This agreement may also contain an addendum to guarantee Soviet Russia's freedom to add armaments for use in the Far East in the event that Japan refuses to conclude a corresponding treaty. Another agreement, joined by the United States, can establish a universal system for managing and monitoring armaments. However, the German newspapers said that France was only driven by a tactical effect. News from New York said that the United States did not change its policy on sanctions. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The French government's verbal note to the British government yesterday on the disarmament issue has been quite satisfactory to political circles here, as can be seen from the remarks of various newspapers published on Sunday. For example, The Sunday Times said that this verbal note can bring the entire discussion of the disarmament issue into an important new stage. With this note, the disarmament convention is possible to be established. The Observer said that the French Foreign Ministry's verbal note to the British Foreign Ministry is a novel and important interpretation of France's disarmament policy. With this, Minister of the Crown Eden's visit to Geneva can be filled with greater hope, and the presidium of the Disarmament Conference will definitely be able to do something, so as not to be disappointed by being able to only prolong the conference. The newspaper also said that the French note has a certain effect on British policy at present, that is, Britain can study whether it can conclude a partial agreement with all European countries below the number stipulated in the British plan in order to seek no further increase in armaments, rather than only a special agreement concluded by Western European countries as the outside world has said. What people are now considering is to conclude several treaties within the scope of a general convention. For example, all European countries, including Soviet Russia, can conclude a treaty that includes an addendum stating that if Japan refuses to sign a disarmament treaty related to that country, then Soviet Russia has the right to deploy armaments in the Far East. In this way, Soviet Russia will be tantamount to becoming two units in diplomacy. In addition, another treaty can be concluded that includes the United States. This agreement should establish a universal monitoring system for armaments. In short, the first hope after the French note was issued is that the disarmament convention that European countries can recognize will guarantee its effective implementation in what way. It is hoped that countries will agree on this in the future, and so on. (8th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) Political circles have expressed satisfaction with the French verbal note, as mentioned in the previous telegram. Public opinion also attaches great importance to this note. This can be seen from the remarks made by British Member of Parliament General Spears in The Times of London. The general said that the understanding between Britain and France is enough to celebrate. However, what is even more gratifying is that British public opinion is now not only clear that peace is related to our primary interests, but also understands that if we want to achieve peace, we must pay a price. In other words, if we want to avoid war, we must pay insurance premiums. This kind of psychology can be seen from various impressions. The general continued, "The British nation is born and does not enjoy concluding alliances with any country, but the necessity of jointly ensuring security and the actions that should be taken to build this security have been recognized by Britain. The current priority is to act urgently, as the rearmament has already begun. We know that Germany's air force expenditure has increased from only 3.9 million pounds to 10.5 million pounds in just one year. We are not far from the last time. The time is pressing and does not allow for delay." (8th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Beautiful Woman Bandit Kidnaps Police Officer</h3>
<p>In Scott, Kansas, a police officer named John Boh was kidnapped yesterday by a female bandit. The female bandit was sucking on a cigar, beautiful in appearance, but as fierce as a lion. When she and two male bandits were carrying out a robbery, the police officer stepped forward to arrest them, but was instead kidnapped. He was seen by a farmer the next day, having been abandoned by the bandits. According to the police officer, the female bandit's name is Miss Manny Parker, and the male bandits' names are Barrow and Maheton, all of whom are notorious bandits. When the police officer tried to arrest the female bandit and others because they had killed two motorcycle police officers a week ago, the female bandit opened fire and killed another police officer named Campbell. John Boh himself said that when he was abducted, the female bandit straddled his back, blew cigar smoke in his ear, and laughed and humiliated him at will, saying that if he tried to escape, she would shoot him. According to the police officer, the female bandit can be called a beauty, but her eyes are full of fierce light, and there is a scar on the corner of her mouth. She often speaks bandit slang with the male bandits, and seems to have long been accustomed to the life of a bandit. The police officer was pushed out of the car, and the next morning he telephoned nearby police stations to try his best to hunt them down, but the three bandits were still nowhere to be found.

Although Schacht said that Germany absolutely cannot continue to remit payments in the existing way, he made optimistic remarks about Germany's economic situation since the establishment of the National Socialist Party system, saying that with time and without excessive pressure, Germany can eventually cope with its debts. However, the monetary situation is worse than before. After Germany's gold reserves fell to as low as 6.7 percent, Germany's foreign trade was greatly hampered. It is believed that creditor nations have a tendency to recognize that the current remittance method needs to be revised. (7th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Prince Konoe Scheduled to Visit the United States</p>
<h3>Hirota Vigorously Seeks to Revamp Diplomacy: Reorganizes the Foreign Ministry and Augments Personnel in Embassies and Consulates; Adopts Talent-Based Approach to Personnel</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) House of Peers Speaker Prince Fumimaro Konoe is scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the Asama Maru on May 17th to visit the United States. However, in order to consider various future situations and issues concerning disarmament and diplomatic policy, he met with Foreign Minister Hirota to inquire about the fundamental policy of Japanese-American diplomacy. In addition to planning to meet with Naval Minister Osumi, he is also scheduled to visit Duke Saionji on the 14th and 15th of this month to report on the current political situation and various aspects of the situation, and then plans to present his opinions to Duke Saionji. (8th, Japanese Allied News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to revamp diplomatic personnel, Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to first reorganize the bureaus and sections of the Foreign Ministry. In addition to the existing European and American, Asian, and Commercial Affairs Bureaus, an American Affairs Bureau will be added. Therefore, the affairs handled by each bureau will be slightly changed. The opportunity will be used to simplify affairs and eliminate accumulated malpractices. Although the names of each bureau have not yet been decided, the regulations for their divisions have been largely determined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The American Affairs Bureau will have three sections: The first section will be in charge of North American affairs; the second section will be in charge of general relations with Central and South America; and the third section will be in charge of passport affairs (separated from the Commercial Affairs Bureau). (2) The European and American Bureau will be renamed the European Bureau and will have three sections: The first section will be in charge of the Soviet Union and its neighboring countries, such as Afghanistan, Persia, Turkey, and Finland; the second section will be in charge of the affairs of various European countries; and the third section, which is newly established, will be in charge of the relations with the colonies and autonomous regions of various countries, such as Australia and India, after the end of next year's disarmament conference. (3) The Asian Bureau will be renamed the East Asian Bureau, and the regulations for its divisions will not be changed. (4) The Commercial Affairs Bureau will have three sections: The first section will study foreign trade treaties and their policies; the second section will be the center of the Commercial Affairs Bureau, handling various commercial affairs for implementation, such as when Japan and the Netherlands or Japan and Britain negotiate, it will study the system in order to negotiate with the other party; and the third section will be in charge of immigration affairs and relations with domestic circles. (8th, Japanese Allied News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Now that the current session of the Diet has ended smoothly, and relations with the United States and Russia have gradually improved after half a year of efforts, Foreign Minister Hirota wants to promote his so-called diplomacy of harmony among all nations. Recently, he has frequently urged Ambassador to the United Kingdom Saito, Ambassador to France Sato, Ambassador to Turkey Mushakoji, and Envoy to China Arima to return home in order to discuss a peaceful foreign policy and to enable them to gain a full understanding of the domestic situation in terms of society, politics, and economics. It is now heard that the Foreign Minister is not satisfied with this, and is striving to revamp the following matters in order to be thorough. The reforms are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Diplomatic affairs should be handled expeditiously. The organization of the Foreign Ministry will be fundamentally reorganized.</p>
<p>(2) Efforts will be made to strengthen overseas diplomatic missions.</p>
<p>(3) Personnel will be revamped, talent will be broadly recruited, and recruitment and appointment must expand the scope in order to utilize them effectively.</p>
<p>(4) In order to achieve the above objectives, the diplomatic officer examination must be fundamentally reformed.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota is devising plans for the above points, and he is now starting to implement his specific strategies. This is an unprecedented grand event in the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The Foreign Minister's strategy is nothing more than to be vigilant against the international crisis of 1935 and 1936, which is attracting general attention. As for the reorganization of the Foreign Ministry, the establishment of the American Affairs Bureau was also mentioned in this year's budget proposal, and the regulations for its official system and divisions are currently being discussed with the Bureau of Legislation. It is expected to be submitted to the Privy Council meeting next week. In the past, the Foreign Ministry has always used the Ministry as the center to implement directive diplomacy, lacking complete communication with overseas envoys. Therefore, from the ninth fiscal year, it is planned to reduce the number of personnel in the Ministry and increase the number of personnel in overseas embassies and consulates, so that they can shoulder full responsibility and rationalize affairs. For personnel, a talent-based approach will be adopted, selecting outstanding individuals to open up avenues for appointment, abolishing the method of promotion based on age and seniority. Regarding the appointment of diplomats, the form of free appointment has existed only in name. Various parties can recommend ambassadors and envoys, but the Foreign Ministry adheres to a narrow Monroe Doctrine, blocking the path of those outside the government. Now, in light of this situation, in order to cope with the importance of economic diplomacy, it is necessary to actively utilize the free appointment system. Regarding the diplomatic officer examination method, the subjects must also be improved. In addition to international law, diplomatic history, and political economy, sociology, literature, philosophy, etc. should be added. Other aspects, such as written tests, oral tests, and physical examinations, should not be overemphasized, as they are prone to corruption. Therefore, it is appropriate to break with old habits, adopt individuals with ample common sense, and begin implementing the new diplomatic officer examination starting in July of this year.

<h3>Taiwan's Surplus Rice Sold to Southern China</h3>

<h3>U.S. Naval Exercises: 113 Warships Participating; Roosevelt to Inspect in New York; Returning to Pacific after Autumn</h3>
<p>A public announcement was made today in San Pedro, California: The U.S. fleet currently stationed off the coasts of San Pedro and San Diego, under the command of U.S. Admiral Sellers, will sail to Panama on Monday to conduct exercises. The fleet is organized into two groups: combat and reconnaissance. A total of 113 ships, 3,700 naval officers, and 44,000 sailors will participate in the exercises. The types of warships participating include submarines, transport ships, gunboats, and speedboats. In addition, there will be a destroyer squadron. The fleet will leave the Panama Canal Zone on May 5th, after which it will intensify its exercises and head to New York via the Caribbean, in preparation for President Roosevelt's inspection on the Hudson River on May 31st. The U.S. fleet's ability to maneuver in the waters off Manhattan marks a new precedent since Secretary of the Navy Daniels held peacetime inspections in 1918. Outside speculation suggests that the fleet participating in the exercises will return to its Pacific defense duties this autumn. This demonstrates that the U.S. government does not consider the current situation in the Pacific to be tense, and is therefore temporarily withdrawing the fleet from the U.S. West Coast to signify U.S. policy. Since the U.S. Navy held inspections in 1932, its reconnaissance and combat fleets have been merged and stationed permanently in the Pacific. There are two reasons for this continued presence in the Pacific: first, the U.S. administration wants to save the Navy Department's expenses; second, it is to facilitate the implementation of naval training programs. U.S. Senator from California, [Name], commented on the naval inspection in New York, believing that it is unwise for the U.S. to withdraw the Pacific Fleet when the situation in the Far East is tense.

<h3>Shen Honglie and Ge Guangting Arrive in Jinan</h3>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Ge Guangting and Zhao Hengti arrived in Jinan from Qingdao. Ge said that the Jiaoji Railway previously earned 60,000 yuan per day, but now, due to Liu Guitang's rampages in Shandong, freight traffic has decreased, resulting in a daily loss of 30,000 yuan.

<h3>Closing of the 65th Japanese Diet (Japanese Dispatch): Twilight of Parliamentary Politics; Rise of Militaristic Politics</h3>
<p>After more than two months of repeated disturbances, the 65th Diet has finally come to a smooth close. Before the official opening of the Diet, everyone thought that Japanese parliamentary politics would likely become a sequel to German parliamentary politics. Those who control politics would certainly not be the National Socialist Party from the people, but rather the warlords who possess guns. However, due to international diplomatic isolation, tense relations with the Soviet Union, and hesitation to easily start a war, the military itself was divided, leading to criticism from the people. At the beginning of the Diet session, the capitalists, in order to protect their own interests, had to unanimously deal with the warlords and the bureaucrats who depended on the warlords. Therefore, the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties jointly proposed a merger, which was an implicit attempt to confront the military and restrict military power.</p>
<p>After Araki Sadao resigned as Minister of the Army, the situation eased slightly. The Diet did conduct several severe inquiries into military discipline. Although the military was temporarily in a difficult situation, it ultimately held real power and had achieved success in its aggression. The parliamentarians with financial support, and the general public, had long been weary of their behavior. Therefore, they could only fire blank shots and dared not truly engage in a fistfight. During those days of serious questioning of military discipline, the Diet did indeed regain some momentum and win some praise. If it could have truly moved forward with determination, it would have been possible to restore the rule of law.</p>
<p>However, the military's tactics were also quite strong. At the same time, they knew that each political party had its own flaws and disgruntled elements within it. Therefore, first, the issue of Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima Kumakichi praising the rebel Ashikaga Takauji arose, forcing him to resign. This was not a blow to the cabinet, but rather a severely unfavorable impact on the political parties. Although this belonged to the scope of so-called discipline, it was more unfavorable to the government than to the political parties. Then, the second problem arose: Okamoto Ikki's accusation of bribery against Minister of Education Hatoyama Ichirō. After investigation, Hatoyama did not take bribes, but the 50,000 yuan was a donation to the Seiyūkai. At the same time, it was discovered that the Minseitō also had similar incidents. Thus, although Hatoyama himself did not show signs of taking bribes, the shortcomings of the political parties were exposed. In the past, although the issue of political parties relying on financial groups as their background was exposed, the general public was still skeptical and some even excused it. After this formal exposure in the Diet, the credibility of parliamentary politics was completely lost. This not only meant that Hatoyama himself could no longer cling to the position of Minister of Education, but Suzuki Kisaburō was also affected. Both the Seiyūkai and Minseitō received negative reviews, and the opportunity to restore parliamentary politics was lost from then on.</p>
<p>Originally, the passage of this budget案 was very difficult. According to Japan's current national strength, it was considered too heavy. The expenditure of 2.11 billion yen for the general account, plus the expenditure of 190 million yen for the special account for communications projects, totaled 2.3 billion yen. Of the general account, the expenditure for the army and navy accounted for 936 million yen, or 44 percent of the general expenditure. This was unacceptable to the Diet, which wanted to restore constitutional norms, and it was an unbearable burden for the general public of Japan. However, it was ultimately passed. In particular, the military expenditure was not reduced at all. From this, it can be seen that the military's power is still very great, and the Diet is merely a consultative body. As for other important issues, such as the school problem, from the bribery case involving nearly 30 school principals to the deterioration of thought, no solutions were found. The reform of local administration also remained without a clue, and there was no solution for the 6 billion yen in debt owed by the various rural villages. Rice could only be stored in warehouses by the government. The industrial boom was due to the government's lending policy and the stimulus of military industry. All of these things made the Japanese people more dissatisfied with the Diet and further weakened parliamentary politics. Thus, the so-called "extraordinary times" will be prolonged, and the arrogance of the military will become more severe. (March 29, 1934, Tokyo)</p>
<h3>Completion of Japan's Reconstruction of the Tiantulu Railway</h3>
<p>Facilitating Military Transportation and Defending Against Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Gathering Various Products Along the Line</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: Japan is actively developing railways in the Northeast, and its deep intentions and objectives are unfathomable. However, on the surface, one says it is for the friendship of the Japanese and Manchu nations, to jointly develop transportation and prosper the Northeast; and the other says it is to promote Northeast culture and maintain East Asian peace. In reality, it has ambitions. For example, this time, the reconstruction of the Tiantulu Railway (from Tianbaoshan to Tumen River) has taken a year and a half to widen the track. Now it has been fully completed, and the determination to do this is because this line can have a huge effect on military defense against Soviet Russia. In addition, the Japanese have also conducted detailed investigations of the mineral products, agricultural products, population, trade, and other information in the affiliated areas through which the Tiantulu line passes. Now, according to the Japanese investigation, the following is recorded:</p>
<h3>Population and Products Along the Line</h3>
<p>The Tiantulu Railway is now renamed the Jingtulu by the Japanese puppets. It opened in October of the 13th year of the Republic of China (from Kaishantun to Laotoukou, a total of 13 stations), across the Tumen River and connected to the Tumen Railway from Sambong, Korea. This opening changed Longjingcun, Dongshengyong, Badaohezi, Shimenzi, and Kaishantun stations. Since the Tiantulu Railway, it has comprehensively controlled the transportation hub of Yanji County. According to the Japanese survey of Yanji and Helong counties the year before last, Helong has an area of 3.7 million square li, and Yanji has an area of 5.18 million square li. Helong has 18,384 households, with a total of 108,384 people, and Yanji has 47,099 households, with a total of 263,627 people. The total land area of Yanji County is 179,888 chō, of which 72,220 chō are cultivated land. The total land area of Helong County is 149,942 chō, of which 21,838 chō are cultivated land. The total cultivated land is 94,058 chō. The annual agricultural harvest of Yanji County is 1,191,630 shī, and that of Helong County is 283,900 shī, for a total annual output of 1,475,530 shī. Among them, soybeans account for 35% to 50% of the total quantity, and rice accounts for 37%. It is found that in addition to a small amount of local consumption, a large amount of this harvest relies on railway transportation for export. This vast land must also rely on this railway line to develop resources. Therefore, this road occupies an important position in terms of time and space.</p>
<h3>Transportation Volume of Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>In the past, the trade of Yanbian was centered on Yanji, and the routes for import and export mostly passed through Jilin and Hunchun, and exported to Russia. Since the opening of the Qinghui Line in the 6th year of Taisho (1917), financial institutions such as the East Asia Development Company and the Bank of Korea were established in this port (Longjingcun). In the 9th year of Taisho (1920), the Tumen Railway was built between Huining and Samboong. Since then, trade with this port has become frequent. In the 16th year of Taisho (1927), the Tiantulu Light Railway was completed. Therefore, the number of financial institutions in this port has increased with the times, so the total amount of trade last year has reached 8 million yuan. As a result, transportation agencies and other industries are also becoming more prosperous. The quantity of grains exported by the Tiantulu Railway last year is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Product/Origin Soybeans White Beans Mung Beans Millet Other Total</p>
<p>Laotoukou 87,034 6,956 6,187 704 161 100,897 Tongfozhen 32,554 4,166 2,400 497 10 439,726 Chaoyangchuan 32,373 3,807 1,112 86 37,378 Yanji 97,011 3,024 8,140 49 108,770 Badaogou 41,061 40 134 32 916 46,422 Dongshengyong 1,116 1,116</p>
<p>Longjingcun 154,006 22,796 8,070 1,883 28 187,038 Between Jongseong and Sambong 35,000 2,000 1,500 37,000 757 5,575 Total 480,155 46,762 27,844 4,058 1,688 596,917</p>
<p>In addition to Yanji, the transportation of the above agricultural exports still relies heavily on the Southern Loop Line. After the opening of the Jidun Line and the Labin Line, these grains are mostly marked and centered on Qingjin Port before the completion of the Rajin Port.</p>
<h3>Export and Import Statistics</h3>
<p>According to the survey by the Japanese Customs of the Puppet State, trade was quite prosperous from Showa 1 (1926) to 5 (1930). Since the establishment of the Puppet State, the total trade volume of Yanbian reached 20 million yuan last year. As a result, the industries and other various undertakings in various parts of Yanbian have developed daily. Therefore, Yanbian's trade is really centered on Longbu. Also, after the reconstruction of the Tiantulu Railway into a wide-gauge track, transportation has become more convenient. Therefore, the connection between Longjingcun and the interior of Korea will have a closer and better prospect. The export and import amounts between Qingjin and Yanbian are listed below:</p>
<p>Export Product Type Showa 1 Showa 5</p>
<p>Rice 425,079 yuan 63,074 yuan White Rice 400,740 yuan 788,554 yuan Barley 37,190 yuan 28,223 yuan Soybeans 2,125,140 yuan 8,234,426 yuan Miscellaneous Grains 62,494 yuan 2,328 yuan Millet 1,478,445 yuan 584,387 yuan Broomcorn Millet 112,035 yuan 3,720 yuan Mung Beans 198,099 yuan 374,032 yuan Soybean Oil 9,326 yuan</p>

<h3>Active Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Activity in Various Parts of the Northeast</h3>
<p>Zhao Yushan and Others Lead Their Troops to Attack Bin County</p>
<p>Huang Xishan (Old Beifeng) Rises in Benxi</p>
<p>Ao Xisan in Fierce Battle with Japanese and Puppet Troops in Andong</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army has dispersed into smaller units and is lying dormant in various places, awaiting an opportunity to launch an attack. In view of the puppet's usurpation of power, the Japanese and puppet troops have issued orders to all counties to confiscate civilian firearms in order to prevent activity by the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Therefore, patriotic volunteers in various counties who are unwilling to submit to the confiscation have risen up in unison and raised the banner against Japan. The activities of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in various places are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army leaders Zhao Yushan and [Name] (nicknamed "Jiangnan Kui"), etc., have recently gathered more than a thousand patriotic volunteers in the Jianluozi area on the border of Bin County and Yanshou County in Jilin, planning to capture Bin County. The advance troops have advanced to the Yangmugang area, and their momentum is great. They are only thirty to forty li away from the county seat. The Japanese and puppet troops and police stationed in Bin County</p>
<p>were very embarrassed when they suddenly heard that the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army was coming. Therefore, it is not difficult for the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army to directly attack the county seat. In the Huayazi area of Yanshou County, there are also more than 400 Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army troops, all cavalry, with sufficient weapons and ammunition. The leader is Wu Shaochai, who defected from the Shuangcheng County Local Militia. They are now advancing from the Huayazi area to the Yanshou County seat, and their momentum is very valiant. Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army leaders Huang Xishan (Old Beifeng), etc., have mobilized more than 800 Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army troops, operating in the Hujiabaozi area of the Second District of Benxi County, Liaoning. The puppet self-defense force in that fort was disarmed. Now, the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army is still advancing towards the county seat. After the puppet police department received the report, the Japanese instructor led the battalion commander, [Name], and supervised the infantry and cavalry companies to immediately dispatch, and brought machine guns, mortars, etc., to confront the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in Hujiabaozi. It is heard that there has been fierce fighting for a day and night. The Benxi County seat is in a very critical situation.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Ao Xisan, who had previously been lying dormant in the Wulongshan area under the jurisdiction of Andong, suddenly led more than 300 troops and rose up in the Tangshantun Wulongshan area. The garrison of the stationed Japanese army discovered this and sent the entire team to encircle and suppress them. The puppet police also joined in the attack. The Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army took advantage of the night to bypass the back of Wulong Mountain and break through the encirclement without suffering any losses. It is heard that the entire team has entered the mountain, awaiting an opportunity to launch an attack. (Northeast Society)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cotton Yarn Dominates the Hankou Market</h3>
<p>Chinese Factories Under Pressure and Unable to Sustain Themselves</p>
<p>Headquarters Requests Central Government to Find a Way to Help</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Headquarters of the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression has recently received a report from the Hubei Branch of the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation, stating: "The intention of our powerful neighbor, Japan, to cut off our Chinese economy and annex our territory has been a consistent policy since the Meiji Restoration. Historically, they have used their surplus goods and taken advantage of our country's tariff autonomy to easily transport goods to China for sale, occupying markets, and using unequal treaties to establish textile factories in our interior, in order to break through the tariff barriers and directly confront us. Our Chinese cotton mills have long been subjected to their destruction and suppression. However, before the September 18th Incident, because Japanese goods could sell smoothly and unhindered, their selling prices still took into account the cost of labor, and our Chinese counterparts could barely maintain themselves. Since the brutal Japanese revealed their ferocious face, after seizing the three northeastern provinces and shelling Shanghai, our people were accused by conscience and once resisted inferior goods. In order to break through this difficult situation, they took a further step, devaluing prices and dumping goods to break through our country's anti-dumping line in order to seize our country's entire market. From then on, members of the association have struggled to survive, but they are no match for their strength and have no reinforcements to rely on, and they are in danger of bankruptcy at any time. Japanese factories are protected by their government, subsidized with huge sums of money, and their capital is abundant, their machinery is good, and their use of manpower is simple, which is far beyond the reach of Chinese factories. In addition, the Japanese robbed the Yingkou Customs, sharply increased import tariffs, and blocked the transportation and sale of domestic yarn and cloth to the Northeast. On the one hand, they rely on the convenience of transportation to bundle and transport large quantities of yarn and cloth into our interior, reduce prices and dump goods, and even have a bold statement that within a limited period of two years, all Chinese factories will be eliminated. With such internal and external coercion, how can Chinese cotton mills stand? Take the Hankou market in recent days as an example. Rural villages in various places are bankrupt, and sales of yarn and cloth have already declined compared to before. In the context of declining sales, Japanese goods account for four-fifths of daily yarn transactions, while domestic goods only account for one-fifth. Japanese goods account for more than 90% of the sales of cotton cloth. Therefore, the inventory of Chinese factories has reached 300,000 to 400,000 bales of yarn and cloth in Shanghai and Hankou, and financial turnover is extremely difficult. If the government does not take measures to help, they will soon face the path of suspension of work and closure." The Federation also put forward the following measures: (1) Please forward to the Central Government to implement a tax to curb the dumping of foreign goods. (2) Please forward to the Central Government to order all provinces to improve domestic cotton varieties within a time limit and promote cultivation. (3) Please ask the Ministry of Industry to inspect cotton in various places, not only limited to the moisture content, but also to crack down on all mixed impurities and seed cotton, so as to benefit the textile industry. (4) Please follow the example of the Hunan Provincial Government to set up a cotton yarn management office. The headquarters, based on the report, believes that the proposed opinions are generally appropriate, and specifically requests the Central Government to issue orders to various authorities for review and handling, and instructs the Hubei Provincial Government to review and discuss the establishment of a cotton yarn management office for proper consideration.

<h3>Huang Fu Arrives in Jiangxi to Meet Chiang</h3>
<p>Reports on the Current Situation in North China and Seeks Instructions on Everything</p>
<p>Huang Talks About China's Crisis Not Limited to North China</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, arrived in the province from Pingnan the other day. At 10:00 AM on the 6th, he took a special train on the Nansun Railway from Jiujiang. At about 2:00 PM, the train arrived at Niuhang Station. The General Affairs Director of the General Headquarters, Cai Jingjun, and the Protocol Section Chief, Wang Yi, welcomed him at the station. Mr. Huang was wearing a striped flannel Western suit, a brown overcoat, and looked quite thin. After exchanging greetings with the welcomers, he took the Hua Jue ferry of the Water Police Department to cross the river. On the ferry, Huang spoke to reporters about the situation in North China, saying, "I (Huang refers to himself) have been in Beijing for several months and have not been south. This time, I am here to report everything about North China to the Central Government and to Wang and Chiang. The current crisis in North China is China's entire problem. North China is only a part of China. If China does not have a comprehensive solution, the crisis in North China will be difficult to avoid, and the crisis should not be limited to North China." When asked about the current situation in Chahar Province, Huang said that Chahar Province was originally normal, but the outside world was exaggerating it. Tang Youren's trip to North China was for diplomacy. When asked whether the report that there would be new progress regarding North China diplomacy after Chairman Huang arrived in Beijing and that Japanese envoy Arima had also postponed his return to Japan to meet with Chairman Huang was true, Huang replied that he had not heard of this matter. Huang also said that he would stay in Jiangxi for two or three days, then report to the Central Government in Beijing, and then return to his hometown to sweep the tombs. It was uncertain whether he would go to Mogan Mountain. At that time, the ferry had approached the shore, and Xiong Shihui, Yang Yongqin, and others were at the dock to welcome Huang on behalf of Chiang. After Huang landed, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with Xiong and Yang, and then took a General Headquarters car to Number 3 Gongyuan back street. After a short rest, he went to Chiang's residence in Dewai to meet with Chiang and gave a detailed report on the political facilities in North China, the recent situation in various provinces, the situation at the various passes of the Great Wall, the current situation in Yuguan and Luanhe East, and the current situation in Chahar Province.

<h3>Xiamen 台人行刦鉅案</h3>
<p>Haibin Qiuzhai was Robbed</p>
<p>The Main Culprit Was Directly Retrieved by the Japanese Police and Taken to the Consular Office</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Xiamen is a special zone because there are over 20,000 Taiwanese residents of Japanese nationality who are not subject to our national laws and administrative sanctions. Among them, there are thousands of vagrants who specialize in protecting gambling, opium, and brothels, and even engage in theft. However, because they are completely under the rule of the Japanese Consul, they are not subject to our national restrictions, which makes governance extremely difficult. On the night of [blank] of this month, the residence of Qiu Shiding, a comprador of Jardine Matheson, was robbed by Taiwanese bandits. Two thieves were caught afterward, and Shi was immediately taken away by the Japanese Consul without going through extradition procedures, a new precedent only seen in Xiamen.</p>
<p>Previously, the residence of Qiu Shiding's wife, a comprador of Jardine Matheson, was on the third floor of Tianji Foreign Firm on Haihoutan in this city, adjacent to the Bank of Taiwan, Customs, Central Bank, Xiamen Commercial Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, Netherlands Andes Bank, Jardine Matheson, etc., and facing the coast. The area is extremely important and prosperous. At around 7 p.m. on the 2nd, seven bandits suddenly arrived, with two people watching the wind downstairs and five people holding weapons going upstairs. (Qiu's eldest daughter, Nanping, whose courtesy name is Filipina, is the daughter of wealthy overseas Chinese Huang Nianyi, and her engagement was held on the 1st, with the wedding coming soon. Qiu is also wealthy, and the grand ceremony aroused the desire of those who coveted it.) They knocked on the door. Qiu and his wife were both out, and only Qiu's daughter and a servant were in. Hearing the sound, they mistakenly thought Qiu had returned and opened the door. Five people rushed in with guns, first cutting off the telephone line, driving twelve people in the room into the servant's room, and guarding them with one bandit. Four bandits entered each room and searched one by one. The leather suitcases were all pried open with knives. After an hour, they went downstairs and fled, robbing jewelry and clothing worth more than 5,000 yuan, mostly Qiu's daughter's dowry. When the incident occurred, it was only around dusk when the lights were just turned on. The place was a gathering place for banks, and the victim was a wealthy merchant and comprador. The police detectives of the Public Security Bureau mobilized all personnel and conducted overnight investigations, with a dense network of detectives in urban and rural areas, Gulangyu, and the harbor. At 10 a.m. on the 3rd, three people brought pearl flowers, diamond rings, and gold bracelets to Yuancheng Pawnshop on Siming West Road for pawning. They were suspected by the police detectives guarding the store. They left because they disagreed on the price. They were followed and their address was obtained. The report was made to the Detective Team, and a large team was dispatched to arrest them. Two people had already escaped to the coast and boarded the Japanese ship Fengshan Maru in the harbor, but were not caught. It was then that it was discovered that the case was committed by Taiwanese bandits. At 4 p.m. on the 3rd, two people landed again and hid in Dingbingzai. The Public Security Bureau notified the so-called "Japanese Police Department" of the Japanese Consulate in Xiamen and sent Japanese detectives Pan Mengri (Taiwanese) to go to Dingbingzai to arrest two people. They were taken to the Japanese Police Department for questioning. They confessed that there were seven accomplices, all of Taiwanese nationality, and another local person. Many original stolen goods were found on the two people. According to their confession, they went to the place where the stolen goods were deposited and recovered two-thirds of the original stolen goods. They also found 150 yuan in banknotes, which was obtained by selling a pearl flower to Qianmei Jewelry Merchant for 200 yuan and spending 50 yuan. They also confessed that their accomplices were at the Xinnan Hotel. They went to the address to arrest them, but they were not caught. It was already 12 p.m. on the 3rd. They searched in Zhuliao Dajingjiao, Dashengli, Siming North Road, and other places until dawn on the 4th, but still found nothing. However, all arrests were carried out by Japanese police together with our police. The place where the criminals were interrogated was the Japanese Police Department. On the morning of the 4th, the two people were directly sent to the Japanese Consulate on Gulangyu by the Japanese Police Department without going through extradition procedures. The Japanese Consulate did not announce the names of the two people. The detectives of the Public Security Bureau only knew their names as Wan Jin and Tian Shao. At 2 p.m. on the 4th, it was reported that a person named Ya Mu surrendered to the Japanese Consulate. The Public Security Bureau, considering the seriousness of the case, requested that the case be returned for investigation in order to arrest the Taiwanese suspects at large. The Japanese Consulate refused, only replying that the two thieves had been arrested and would be sent to Taiwan for investigation, and the remaining thieves would certainly not be spared. The case was then closed. It is found that the "Japanese Police Department" in Xiamen was established after Japan put forward twenty-one demands, based on the condition of establishing police agencies in our Northeast and Fujian provinces. Later, our government protested that Article 5 of the Twenty-One Demands was not established, and the Japanese Consul agreed to withdraw it, but in fact did not. During the Zang Zhiping era in the twelfth year of the Republic [1923], due to the case of Taiwanese fighting with the Wu family, it was requested again to be revoked. The Japanese Consul Sasaki then removed the signboard of the police department, but the agency still existed. In the seventeenth year of the Republic [1928], due to the case of the Japanese police arresting the Korean Li Jizeng in Xiamen without notifying our government, it was negotiated again. The Japanese Consul Sakamoto Ryuki replied that it had already been revoked, and what existed now was the residence of the Japanese Consulate. In fact, it still existed, but no sign was hung in front of the door. Documents were issued by the "Taiwan Public Association," and the Japanese police did not wear uniforms when going out. The "Japanese Police Department" is an important agency in Xiamen, and people are afraid and habitually call it the "Japanese Police Department." The "Japanese Police Department" has great power and is entirely a Japanese police office in Xiamen that exercises its police power over its nationals. Last year, the Japanese police arrested their nationals in Xiamen Port, but were resisted, and one Japanese policeman was shot and killed, which was the result of their independent exercise of police power. Afterward, our police arrested and killed the murderer. Two years ago, when Japanese nationals committed crimes in Xiamen, or were caught in the act, the Public Security Bureau directly arrested them. After a clear interrogation, the Japanese Consulate would submit an official document and fulfill the extradition procedures to take them away. After the extradition, whether they were punished according to the law and how they were punished were unknown and could not be questioned. In the past two years, if Taiwanese commit crimes in Xiamen, or are caught in the act, the Public Security Bureau cannot directly arrest them and must cooperate with the Japanese police. In this case, after the arrest, they were not sent to the Chinese authorities but were taken to the "Japanese Police Department" and directly taken to the Japanese Consulate by the Japanese Police Department without going through extradition procedures.

<h3>Tang Yulin's Niece Became the Wife of a Bandit</h3>
<p>Captured in Dongping County and Escorted to Jinan</p>
<p>Crying in Pain, Begging for Forgiveness, Willing to Follow a Beggar for Life</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang's bandit troops crossed the fourth district of Dongping County in western Shandong last month. They were intercepted by the army, and several people were captured and executed. Among them was a female bandit who claimed to be the niece of Tang Yulin, the former Chairman of Rehe Province. The Dongping County Magistrate, under the order of the Provincial Government, escorted her to Jinan for interrogation. After arriving in Jinan, she was detained in the detention center. This morning (the 7th) at 10 o'clock, the Military Law Department brought her out for interrogation. The female bandit had very long hair, hanging down her back, of medium height, wearing a navy blue woolen fashionable women's coat and yellow leather shoes. Although she had thin features and a charming demeanor, there was a hint of ferocity in her eyebrows. She spoke the Rehe dialect. The military judge asked her age and origin. She claimed to be 27 years old, her husband's name was Yan Shishan, 28 years old. Tang Yulin was her seventh uncle, her childhood name was "Jie," a person from Rehe City. She suffered misfortune in her childhood, losing her father at the age of two and her mother at the age of three, leaving only two sisters, lonely and helpless. At the age of seven, she went to her seventh uncle's (Tang Yulin) house, where she swept, cleaned, and took care of children, often being abused and suffering extremely. Every time the child cried, she was severely beaten. Such was her fate, what else could she say? At the age of thirteen, unable to bear the abuse, she and her sister ran away together to Qimen Mountain in Weichang County, falling into prostitution, relying on selling smiles to make a living. For four years, she lived an inhuman life, living in Yan Shirong's house. His son, Yan Shishan, was one year older than her. The military judge asked if that was the famous Yan Xishan? She replied, "If it were Yan Xishan, that would be great." Yan Shishan and she were very fond of each other. They married at the age of seventeen. She gave birth to a child that year and another child at the age of twenty-one. The husband's family planted forty mu of buckwheat. She also worked with them. At first, they lived in peace, but last year, the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was not harmonious, and there were often quarrels. She then fled to the house of Liu, her adoptive mother in Niuhai Mountain, to avoid them. Liu Guitang happened to come to Rehe, and Niuhai Mountain was destroyed by him. She was captured and joined the bandit gang, following a Sun surnamed leader of Liu's. She fled everywhere, pitying herself for being born at the wrong time, suffering repeated misfortunes, like a falling flower drifting on the water, letting fate decide her fate. Recently, she fled to Shandong. On the 19th of last month, she, the Sun surnamed leader, a Yan surnamed leader, and others, a total of ten people, abandoned their guns and rode horses to Yan's uncle's house to temporarily avoid them. They were captured by the fourth district chief and escorted to Dongping County. The other nine people have all been executed, and she was escorted to Jinan. After she finished her confession, the military judge asked if she had ridden a horse and carried double-barreled pistols to disturb the people with the bandits, as reported? She replied, "No, that's not true. I am terrified of guns, how dare I be a bandit?" He asked if she had ever fired a gun with the bandits? She replied, "No, I was just at the end of the line, sitting on a bullet cart." He also asked, "Tang Yulin is a provincial chairman, why would he marry his niece to a farmer? That's not reasonable." She replied, "I have already confessed that I ran away because of abuse." He also asked, "Looking at your clothing and accessories, you don't look like a farmer." She replied, "The clothes were changed after following the Sun surname leader." He also asked, "Your husband, Yan Shishan, is Tang Yulin's nephew-in-law, has he ever worked for him?" She replied, "No, he is illiterate." He also asked, "Have you been educated?" She replied, "No." He also asked, "You must tell the truth, not only will you be pardoned, but we can also send a telegram to ask your husband's family to send you back, or find you something to do in Shandong." She replied, "My husband's family abuses me, I don't want to go back, I only ask to be pardoned, and find a beggar to follow for the rest of my life, I would be willing to do so." After she finished speaking, she cried bitterly, with tears streaming down her face, kowtowing non-stop. It was already 11:30. The military judge ordered her to be returned to custody. (7th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Carpenter Kills Himself Due to Losses from Building a House</h3>
<p>In the Yexie area of the 14th district of the county, Jiang Shouren was building a house, which was contracted by the construction foreman Yu Mingqing. The construction cost was several hundred yuan. Since the start of construction, Carpenter Yu has successively received money from Jiang. Now that the roof is completed, the interior decoration has not yet started, and the construction cost has been almost exhausted. The hired workers have not been paid the wages they deserve. The foreman was ashamed to face the house owner and the hired workers. He hid in the new house the day before yesterday, took a chisel and cut his throat. His throat was cut in half. Medical treatment was ineffective and he died. The family has prepared the funeral, and the deceased was very miserable.</p>
<h3>Famous Doctor Shen Wubi Passed Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Jingchang, styled Wubi, was a highly respected national doctor in Wusong. He was a student of the former Qing Dynasty imperial physician Chen Lianfang. When he was just a young man, he liked to read the writings of famous doctors from ancient and modern times. Although Mr. Shen's medical skills were profound and he was widely known, those who came to him for treatment were numerous, but he was never willing to expose himself as a doctor. Therefore, he has not hung up a sign to this day. When Mr. Shen diagnosed illnesses, he did not focus solely on the patient's current condition, but sought deeply for the cause of the illness. Therefore, his diagnoses were very accurate, and his use of medicine was also uniquely effective. Over the past forty years, he has saved countless lives. Unfortunately, last winter, he suffered excessive anxiety that affected his nerves and has been ill ever since. More than three months have passed without any improvement. He passed away on April 5th, at the age of sixty-three. Fortunately, his wise son, Yuxiu, is able to read his father's books, and he is especially able to integrate Chinese and foreign medical theories. He will surely be able to inherit his father's legacy.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Residents of the Ninth District Oppose the Relocation of the District Office</h3>

Gu Ziwen and 32 others sent an urgent telegram to the Provincial Government on the 5th, requesting the county to stop the relocation. They also sent representatives Wang Ziping, Ye Renlong, and Yu Huihua to the province the day before yesterday to petition Chairman Chen. The first section chief, Wan Shaopei, received them and promised to convey their message to Chairman Chen and order the county to stop the relocation. The representatives were satisfied and left. They then went to the Department of Civil Affairs to petition. The second section chief, Wu Zhengyun, received them, and the result was also very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Wuxi The Qingfeng Strike Ends</h3>
<p>The Qingfeng strike came to an end yesterday at 4 p.m. After that, the second factory (the new factory) was forced to stop working because important workers were forced to leave the factory and had no way to work. Also, some workers held incense and went to other factories, asking to join the strike to exert pressure. The county government was deeply concerned that the strike would expand even further. Therefore, Secretary Ye, together with Gui Woshen, the standing member of the county party headquarters, Yang Hanxi and Qian Sunqing, the standing members of the Chamber of Commerce, Chen Xiangchun, the representative of the textile factory industry union, Fan Guquan, the representative of Qingfeng, and the labor representatives, held a temporary meeting in the Chamber of Commerce to discuss mediation measures. As a result, it was decided that: (1) The female worker Bao Afeng, who was under the custody of the county government, would be released first; (2) All labor demands for black stars and yellow water, etc., would be thoroughly rectified by the factory; (3) The Qingfeng branch union would send a letter to the joint union to be forwarded to the county party headquarters and the county government to be responsible for guaranteeing that no further incidents would occur. Both labor and management agreed to the above three items, and it was decided to resume work as usual at 6 a.m. today (the 8th). The strike was then brought to an end.</p>

<h3>Jingjiang A Large Amount of Opium Discovered at Bawugang</h3>
<p>Bawugang in the seventh district of our county has always been known as an opium dock, but no cases have been broken despite cooperation between officials and civilians. Yesterday (the 6th) at 3 p.m., the former captain of the third water police detachment, Mei [blank], learned that opium trafficker Wang Bingsheng and others were carrying a large amount of opium and would arrive at the port on the Ruihe ship. He went to the third water police detachment stationed in Bawu to report the information. Captain He of the detachment, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched several officers and men to take a patrol boat to investigate and arrest them. At the same time, the first police station of the local public security bureau also sent police to assist in the arrest. When the patrol boat sailed to Xiagang, Jiangyin, they saw a small boat that looked suspicious. They searched it and found opium traffickers Wang Bingsheng, Zhang Fengwu (also known as Sheng San), and Xi Hongsheng, as well as more than 440 taels of opium. They immediately took them to the detachment headquarters, where Captain He interrogated them. They all confessed to trafficking opium. It was found that Xi Hongsheng was a water patrol captain of the Jiang Water Public Security Team, Wang Yansheng was a team member, and Zhang Fengwu was the former captain of the Jiangyin Anti-Smuggling Team. They had been engaged in this activity for a long time. At that time, Inspector Yan Zongmin of the Public Security Bureau happened to pass by the area. Upon hearing the news, he went to the water police detachment to take them to the county for legal proceedings. However, the water police team firmly refused. The two sides negotiated, almost leading to a conflict. Gu Yinkui, the director of the Public Security Bureau, led more than 20 patrol officers to investigate at around 10 p.m. and seriously negotiated with the water police team. What happened next will be reported in the sequel.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Sun Ke reported on Mr. Wu Tiyun's deeds, saying: "Today is the day when all circles commemorate Mr. Wu Tiyun. Mr. Wu was a comrade of our party. His life deeds, learning, and morality are known to all of you present. Taking this opportunity, I will briefly talk about Mr. Wu's deeds. Mr. Wu was one of China's few talents. He was a capable diplomat and a legal scholar. Since the founding of our party, Mr. Wu has followed the Premier, ran around for the revolution, and worked very hard. He dedicated his entire life's spirit and wealth to the party and the country. In the sixth year of the Republic [1917], when the proposal to declare war on Germany arose, Mr. Duan was in power. Mr. Wu Zhiyong was the head of foreign affairs and presided over it with the greatest effort. The public assisted him from the side, and the overall plan was decided. Before long, the warlords disrupted the government and dissolved the parliament. The public resigned and followed Mr. Zhiyong to the south to open the Southwest Constitutional Protection Bureau. In the seventh year [1918], the Guangzhou military government was established, and the public served as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Director of the General Affairs Office of the military government. More than half a year later, Europe stopped the war and opened peace talks in Paris. The public was ordered to be the plenipotentiary envoy, attended the peace conference, negotiated and rejected the Treaty of Versailles. In the ninth year [1920], Premier Sun took office as Extraordinary President, and the public still served as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. In June of the tenth year [1921], Mr. Zhiyong died, and the public lived in mourning in Shanghai. In the twelfth year [1923], he returned to Guangdong and followed the Premier to devote himself to the revolution, serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the General Headquarters and other important positions. In the fourteenth year [1925], the National Government was established in Guangdong, and the public served as a member of the National Government and Chairman of the Judicial Committee. When the National Revolutionary Army established its capital in Nanjing, the public served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then was ordered to be the Plenipotentiary Representative in the United States, and later changed to Minister to the United States. He served in the United States for three years, and successively negotiated important cases with the U.S. State Department on tariff autonomy and the abolition of consular jurisdiction. In the summer of the twentieth year [1931], he resigned and returned to China. After arriving in Guangdong, he was appointed Chairman of Guangdong Province and concurrently the Administrative Officer of the Qiongyai Special District. He was later elected President of the Judicial Yuan and member of the National Government, but he strongly declined all positions except for the position of Administrative Officer of the Qiongyai Special District, which he gladly accepted. Mr. believed that local and central governments should advance at the same time in order to achieve internal and external coordination and avoid distorted development. In the spring of the twenty-second year [1933], he traveled to the famous mountains and rivers of Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, and visited the hidden situations of the people. But heaven did not grant him more years, and he suddenly passed away, which was a great loss to our party and government. Although Mr. has passed away, his work of saving the country and the people has not yet been completed, and there is much that needs to be done by our people. The preparatory committee proposed to build a bronze statue of Mr. and to organize a scholarship fund, which are both perfect measures. I hope that all sectors will help to fulfill Mr. Wu's long-cherished wish to revive the nation and save the country."</p>
<h3>Wang's Speech</h3>
<p>Guest Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, saying: "I have known Mr. Wu Tiyun for more than ten years. Mr. Wu's life can be described with the phrase 'cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the country, and pacifying the world.' He was able to cultivate himself, so his knowledge was outstanding, and he became a legal scholar. He was able to manage his family, so Mr. often took his family to visit the hidden situations of the people in various provinces, cities, counties, and townships. Mr. Wu used to tell me that officials must go to the people to observe hidden situations. Mr. Wu was also able to recover tariff autonomy and abolish unequal treaties. Therefore, it is not unfair to say that Mr. Wu was able to govern the country and pacify the world. We commemorate Mr. Wu and should learn from Mr. Wu's knowledge and morality and continue to work hard."</p>
<h3>Family Reply</h3>
<p>After Wang Xiaolai finished speaking, Mrs. Wu, Ms. He, and her eldest daughter, Yanzhuang, gave a reply, saying: "Chairman, gentlemen, ladies, today is the date when people from all walks of life across the country commemorate our late father in Shanghai. We are honored that the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government have sent representatives to pay respects, and that various groups, organizations, gentlemen, ladies, and relatives have taken the time to attend in person. In an atmosphere of sorrow and enthusiasm, a solemn and solemn memorial ceremony was held, which shows your deep friendship and affection for our late father. Yanzhuang, on behalf of my family, would like to express our deepest gratitude to all the gentlemen and ladies present. I heard that the gentlemen who initiated this memorial service also intend to organize a scholarship fund and build a bronze statue for our late father as a permanent commemoration. My mother and Yanzhuang are very grateful and very much in favor. We still need your continued help and guidance on how to proceed. My younger brothers are still young and studying in Hong Kong and could not ask for leave, so they did not come this time. We hope you will forgive us. At the same time, Yanzhuang and others would like to express our special thanks to the gentlemen and ladies who organized this memorial service."</p>
<h3>A Collection of Eulogies</h3>
<p>President Lin of the National Government's elegiac couplet reads, "The party and the country value the founding fathers, the fame and achievements of the past generations are recorded in history, the reputation of the world is marked, and it is painful to lose the virtuous in times of crisis." President Wang of the Executive Yuan's elegiac couplet reads, "The platform is famous."</p>

As a result, all trains departing from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday were delayed by four to five hours.</p>
<h3>Passengers Fortunately Uninjured</h3>
<p>The cause of the accident and the issue of responsibility are being carefully investigated by the railway authorities. Fortunately, no passengers were injured, which is a great stroke of luck.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanjing states that at 12:00 noon on the eighth, the 3rd and 4th class train from Beijing to Shanghai derailed near Zha Ze Station, between Zhenjiang and Xinfeng, due to decayed sleepers at a junction.

<p>Yuanshun Steamer Wrecks After Hitting Reef</p>
<h3>Twenty-Nine Crew Members and Passengers Died - Thirty-Four Rescued Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning - Losses Estimated at Over Three Hundred Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>The Yuanshun steamer of the Datongxing Steamer Company, which was carrying goods from Yantai to Xinghua, encountered fog on the morning of the 7th near Huanao Island in the waters off Zhejiang and hit a reef and sank.

Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Hit Reef and Sank</h3>
<p>The Yuanshun steamer loaded cargo such as soybean oil, soybean cakes, rice, and soybeans in Yantai on the evening of the 4th of this month, heading for Xinghua, Fujian. At 12:43 AM on the morning of the 7th, when it reached the waters near Huanao Island off Ningbo, Zhejiang, it suddenly encountered heavy fog in the middle of the night. The ship's owner, Japanese national Morito Kichi, drove at full speed to avoid hidden reefs, but unfortunately, it violently struck a hidden reef. The bottom of the ship was broken by the reef, and seawater poured in. Because the hole was very large, it sank immediately. The radio operator sent a telegram for help, but within five minutes, the ship completely sank, and the radio operator also died.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boats Rescue</h3>
<p>All sixty-one crew members and two passengers escorting the cargo to Xinghua, a total of sixty-three people, realized that the ship was too damaged to save after the collision, and since it was already sinking, they jumped into the water to escape. After being alerted, nearby fishing boats rushed to rescue them. Because it was nighttime, the rescue was difficult. After exerting great effort, a total of thirty-four people were rescued, but all were rescued from the water. At dawn, the fishing boats carried the rescued to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Ship Owner's Report</h3>
<p>After the rescued crew members and passengers arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, the Shanghai branch of Datongxing immediately sent personnel to Wusong to greet them, temporarily placing them in the Ping'an Hotel, and providing them with clothing and meals. After arriving in Shanghai, ship owner Morito Kichi reported the details of the collision with the reef to Zhou Zian of the Shanghai branch, as well as the number of casualties. The Shanghai branch immediately telegraphed the Yingkou headquarters and the Yantai and Xinghua agencies to report the details of the collision.</p>
<h3>Insurance Amount</h3>
<p>The Yuanshun steamer was insured for 120,000 yuan against marine accidents by Datongxing Steamer Company with nine insurance companies including Taiping Insurance Company, Huaan Insurance Company, Shanghai United Marine and Fire Insurance Company, Zhaotai Marine and Fire Insurance Company, Ningshao Insurance Department, Sincere Insurance Company, Luntai Marine and Fire Insurance Company, Yongning Marine and Fire Insurance Company, and China Marine Accident Insurance Company. After the Yuanshun steamer hit the reef, all insurance companies were immediately notified. It is said that the ship insurance association organized by various insurance companies held a special meeting yesterday to discuss this case. Because it has already sunk, it was decided to abandon the salvage.</p>
<h3>Total Loss</h3>
<p>The Yuanshun steamer carried over 2,100 tons of goods from Yantai, including soybeans, soybean oil, soybean cakes, rice, and sorghum, worth over 150,000 yuan. It is said that the cargo owners also had marine insurance. Including the sinking of the ship and all losses of crew and passenger luggage, the total loss is over 300,000 yuan, but this does not include the deaths of crew members and passengers.</p>
<h3>Post-Accident Arrangements</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with the manager of the Datongxing Shanghai branch last night. According to him, the Yuanshun steamer unfortunately encountered fog and hit a reef near Huanao Island off Ningbo and sank because it hit a hidden reef, resulting in an immediate sinking. The ship and cargo were completely lost, and salvage is practically impossible. As for the rescued crew members and passengers, their food and lodging are being temporarily maintained. How to handle the future arrangements and how to compensate the deceased will depend on the decision of the Yingkou headquarters regarding post-accident arrangements.</p>
<p>New Life Movement Week</p>
<h3>Implementation Begins Today - Promotion Association Notifies Citizens of Matters to Note - Organizes Military Police Inspection Team to Guide Citizens - College Students and Female Students Organize Propaganda Teams</h3>
<p>City Scouts Distribute Slogans Door-to-Door</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association has decided to hold a movement week starting today (the 9th), so the work is very busy. Although yesterday was a regular holiday, the association still worked as usual. The association's progress and news from all sides are summarized below.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Week Begins</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association officially established on the 1st and resolved to hold a New Life Movement Week, scheduled from today (the 9th) to the 15th. The association immediately formulated a work plan and implemented it as scheduled. Today is designated as School Day, so all the association's directors are participating in memorial weeks at schools throughout the city, reporting on the meaning and covenants of the New Life, and inspecting the progress of the New Life Movement in each school. At present, all schools are covered in posters, have been thoroughly cleaned, and are arranged in a new way, truly a new record unlike anything seen before.</p>
<h3>Notifies Citizens of Matters to Note</h3>
<p>The sixth day of Movement Week (April 14th) is designated as Family Day, and the seventh day (April 15th) is designated as General Citizen Day, both of which are directly related to the citizens. Therefore, in addition to convening a citizen's assembly to report on propaganda and organizing a military police inspection team to guide citizens at all times, organizing a female student propaganda team to guide families at all times, and organizing a scout propaganda team to distribute slogans door-to-door, and also writing to the health authorities of the Chinese and foreign concessions to hold a major cleanup, all citizens are notified of matters to note. The notice reads, "For the purpose of notification, since the New Life Movement was promoted by Chairman Chiang, it has been rising rapidly throughout the country, with successive events being held. This movement is truly a kind of innovative movement for revitalizing the nation, saving the country, and building the country. However, whether this movement can be implemented depends on whether the people can participate and take it as their own. At the founding meeting, this association decided to hold a New Life Movement Propaganda Week from April 9th to 15th. The sixth day (April 14th) is Family Day, and the association stipulates that on this day, all households in the city will hold a major cleanup and should pay attention to the following matters: A. Clean the walls of the house, B. Wash bedding, C. Children's clothes and bodies should be kept clean, D. The floors inside and outside the house and the paths in front and behind the doors should be swept clean. The seventh day (April 15th) is General Citizen Day, and the association stipulates the following measures: A. Convene a citizen's assembly (the location and time will be announced in the newspaper separately), B. Hang party and national flags throughout the city,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>C. In all villages, neighborhoods, and streets throughout the city, the homeowner is responsible for ordering the doorman to clean up, and</p>
<p>note that garbage should not be dumped on the ground. The above measures should be notified to all citizens and homeowners to be fully aware and strictly followed, to facilitate the progress of the New Life, which is of utmost importance. This is hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Organize Inspection Team to Guide Citizens</h3>
<p>The Promotion Association believes that although citizens have a considerable understanding of the New Life Movement, it is feared that there are still some who do not fully understand it. Therefore, it has specifically written to the Second Regiment of Military Police and the Municipal Scout Council, requesting them to separately</p>
<p>organize several inspection teams to go to all parts of the city to inspect. If they encounter citizens who do not comply with the New Life covenants, they will immediately correct them.</p>
<h3>College and Female Students Form Propaganda Teams</h3>
<p>For the sake of widespread propaganda, in addition to holding Movement Week and sending personnel to various radio stations to report on the New Life covenants, and showing films with New Life slogans, as well as convening a citizen's assembly and a lantern parade, and various other propaganda activities, Mr. Mo Xuanyuan is organizing thirteen college student propaganda teams, each with five members, holding white banners, to go to the streets and alleys to lecture on the meaning of the New Life Movement. The female student propaganda teams are being organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, which is notifying various schools to voluntarily organize them, responsible for propagating the New Life and guiding all matters related to families.</p>
<h3>Scouts Distribute Slogans Door-to-Door</h3>
<p>The Promotion Association believes that the Scouts' service to society has been very good, so it has agreed with the Municipal Scout Council to direct all organizations to form New Life Movement propaganda teams to go to various places to propagate, and to carry a large number of propaganda materials to distribute slogans door-to-door at any time, so that everyone knows about it, and to promote the realization of the New Life.</p>
<h3>Movement Begins with Hanging of Party and National Flags</h3>
<p>The New Life Movement Week in this city has begun today. According to the regulations of the Promotion Association, all agencies, groups, schools, party headquarters, companies, firms, shops, residents, etc. should hang party and national flags on different days. On the seventh day, all flags must be hung throughout the city to promote public attention to the New Life Movement and to abandon the old and embrace the new.</p>
<h3>Promotion Association Adds Staff</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the New Life Movement Promotion Association has been exceptionally busy with internal work. Recently, due to the holding of Movement Week, the events have become even more numerous and onerous, so the original four executive secretaries, Hu Tianseng, Shen Liangzhong, Gu Ruofeng, and Yang Dean, have been unable to allocate the work sufficiently. Therefore, three more people, Huang E, Tong Muge, and Zhang Hanyun, were added to assist in the handling of affairs the day before yesterday. As Movement Week begins today, all propaganda materials to be used in various places must be delivered in advance. There are hundreds of schools, and more than a dozen traffic department bicycle riders were sent yesterday to distribute them. It is reported that there are still a large number of propaganda materials to be distributed today.</p>
<h3>Business and Industry - Farewell to National Labor Representatives - Delegation of Six Departing by Ship Tonight</h3>
<p>The delegation of our country attending this International Labor Conference has been decided to take the Conte Rosso of the Italian Postal Ship Company tomorrow morning to leave the country. Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, and Guo Shun, chairman of the China General Federation of Industry, jointly hosted a banquet at the Yiyou Club this afternoon to bid farewell to Li Pingheng, Wang Zhisheng, and others, and invited Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, and other leaders of the local business community to accompany them, so that before the representatives depart, they can exchange opinions as much as possible on all aspects of attending the National Labor Conference.

Those going together include government representative Li Pingheng, consultant Bao Huaguo, employer representative Wang Zhisheng, employee representative An Futing, consultant Cheng Haifeng, and secretary Zhang Yi, a total of six people.</p>
<p>The workers of various industries in this city, because Director Li is a person who is usually enthusiastic about improving the working conditions, this time going abroad to defend the rights of the government and seek the welfare of the workers, traveling far across the ocean and not hesitating to work hard, are deeply admired. After several meetings, it was decided to hold a farewell meeting for Li's departure to strengthen their resolve and wish our country victory.

He arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the Guangji wheel for treatment at the Red Cross Hospital. Navy Minister Chen Zhaokuan personally visited him. The Jiangfeng aircraft was shipped to Shanghai for repair by the Chutai warship and may arrive this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon by Ship</h3>
<p>After Naval Aviation Instructor Xu Chengqi flew the Jiangfeng aircraft from Shanghai to Fujian and crashed near Wenzhou on the afternoon of the 1st, Xu was injured and admitted to the Datong Hospital in Wenzhou for treatment. The Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office specially dispatched engineer Wang Chonghong from Shanghai to Wenzhou to visit. The Navy Department telegraphed the Chutai warship to rush to rescue. Xu originally took the ship back to Shanghai, but because the ship was slow, he changed to the China Merchants Bureau's Guangji wheel, which set sail from Wenzhou the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at about 11:00 AM yesterday. Wang accompanied him. After landing at the Jinliyuan Wharf, Xu was immediately taken to the First Hospital of the Red Cross Society on Haig Road for treatment.</p>

He was flying ten minutes away from Wenzhou in the sea off Qilizhen in Yueqing County, 50 miles from Wenzhou, when the weather was rainy and foggy.</p>
<p>The engine suddenly stopped and could not be started. He was forced to land. Because there were many fishing boats in the sea, he had to land diagonally. Fortunately, the flight was relatively low, and fortunately, he did not touch the fishing boat's mast, so the injury was relatively light, otherwise he would have died.</p>
<h3>Ribs and Spine Injured</h3>
<p>Xu also said that after he was injured, he was rescued by a local fishing boat and transported to Wenzhou, where he was admitted to the Datong Hospital. The diagnosis, treatment, and medication were very good. He is now coming to Shanghai for treatment under the orders of Minister Chen Shaokuan and Director Zeng Yijing. Xu said that aircraft accidents are common, but his old mother and elder brother Chengliang are in Fujian, which makes him very worried. After the reporter left, he visited Dr. Shao Youshan, the surgeon in charge of Xu's treatment at the hospital. According to him, Xu's injury was that the seventh rib on his left chest was injured and had bulged outward, causing constant pain. His spine was also injured, and his right foot was only slightly injured. There was no life-threatening danger. He has been examined and will be x-rayed today to examine the injury before prescribing treatment.</p>
<h3>Chen Personally Visits</h3>
<p>After Xu entered the Red Cross Hospital yesterday afternoon, Xu's relatives and friends in Shanghai went to express their condolences. Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to handle the business of the Jiangnan Shipyard.

<p>Dispute Between Rice Merchants and Measuremen in Northern City</p>
<h3>Restoring Measuring Yesterday Morning After Persuasion Public Association Announces Compromise Measures to All Parties Measuremen Still Hold Different Views and Will Request Party and Government Handling</h3>
<p>Dagongshe reports that the ship merchants transporting rice from various regions north of Shanghai and the rice measuremen caused a complete strike due to the abolition of the measuring labor fees and liquor money. After the party and government authorities, together with the Northern Shanghai Rice Grain Business Association, earnestly persuaded them, they resumed measuring as usual yesterday morning. The liquor money and the increased measuring labor will be further mediated. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Resuming Measuring Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The rice measuremen of various rice shops along the Suzhou River and Datong Road in the northern part of Shanghai City suddenly had their original measuring labor fees and liquor money abolished by the rice merchants, resulting in a complete strike. After the party and government authorities of this city reported the situation to the Measuremen's Union, they immediately sent personnel to the Northern Shanghai Rice Grain Business Association to persuade them. Merchants from Changshu, Suzhou, Jiangyin, Yixing, and other regions first started measuring, but merchants from Wuxi, Tongli, and Qingpu still insisted on complete abolition. After Jiang Shizhi, a representative of the association, proposed a compromise of 2.5 cents per *dan*, he continued to persuade both parties, and they all resumed measuring as usual yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Compromise Measures</h3>
<p>The Northern Shanghai Rice Grain Business Association issued a notice yesterday to the rice measuremen and merchants of various rice shops, stating that the dispute over heavy measuring and liquor money has caused an invisible market shutdown for several days. Now, the responsible personnel of the party and government authorities, together with the rice shop merchants, have decided that if the measuremen do not measure rice according to regulations in the future, they can report it by phone at any time, and personnel will be dispatched to the site for spot checks. If there are any violations, the measuremen will be strictly punished. As for the long-standing bad practice of liquor money, it has been decided that 2.5 cents per *shi* will be given. This is hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Tripartite Consultation</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Northern City Office of the Bean and Rice Business Association and the Shanghai City Rice Grain Business Association convened a temporary meeting at the Datong Road clubhouse, gathering representatives from the Rice Measuremen's Union and ship merchants from various regions. Qiang Zisheng chaired the meeting. First, the chairman reported the significance of convening the three parties for mediation and the compromise solution proposed by the association. Then, the rice merchants and the measuremen expressed their opinions, and both agreed to accept the measures stipulated in the notice. However, the measuremen still insisted on their objections, so the chairman announced that this case would be reported to the party and government authorities for handling according to law. The meeting adjourned, and the entire association immediately reported the compromise solution to the higher authorities for approval.</p>
<h3>Contemporary Itineraries</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shaokuan, Zeng Cuming, Chu Minyi, Liu Ruiheng, and others took the night train to Beijing last night.</p>
<p>Tang Youren, the diplomat, participated in the memorial service for Wu Chaochu and came to Shanghai the night before last, accompanied by Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang stationed in Beijing and Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday. Tang returned that evening. Xu Mo, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai by express train at 2:25 PM the day before yesterday and went to his private residence to rest. Xu's trip to Shanghai was purely for personal matters and to attend the banquet of the Polish envoy to China, Weidengtao, today. Xu plans to stay in Shanghai for a short time before returning to Beijing.</p>
<p>Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Association, and Zou Bingwen, a member of the association's standing committee, went to Shaanxi a few days ago to inspect the cotton industry. According to yesterday's news, Chen is expected to return to Shanghai within the week.</p>
<h3>Rong Zongjing Returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday Foreign Reports Erroneous and Not Surprising</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Rong Zongjing, a leading figure in the Shanghai business community, went to Hong Kong on the 27th of last month to investigate business conditions in the southwest. He returned to Shanghai by boat at 9:00 AM yesterday. According to Rong's words to reporters,</p>
<p>This trip to Hong Kong was entirely to inspect the southwest market. I also went to Macau and Guangzhou. I met Zheng Yizhi and others, representatives of the Shanghai business community who went to the southwest for investigation, in Hong Kong. The erroneous news in a certain foreign newspaper is their inherent trick and is not surprising.</p>
<h3>Henan and Anhui Provinces Beg for Disaster Relief Due to Tragic Disasters</h3>
<p>The China Relief Society recently received a telegram from Chairman Zhang Qin of the Henan Province Relief Association, stating that the disaster situation in Hua County is extremely serious and unprecedented. Water has flooded the fields, and sowing is difficult. High ground has been completely covered by flowing sand, which cannot be reclaimed in a short period of time. With the gap between the green and yellow crops, hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are starving and waiting to be fed. If spring relief is not quickly planned, they will all starve to death. At this critical moment, please quickly provide relief. They also received letters from various counties in western Anhui, stating that western Anhui has long been a bandit area and has been gradually recovered by Chairman Liu's command of troops to suppress bandits. Displaced refugees are in urgent need of relief. A temporary immigration work group has been established. The situations personally seen in Lihuang, Mabu, Yeji, and Kaishunjie are extremely tragic. More than 5,000 people in Lihuang, more than 2,000 people in Mabu, more than 3,000 people in Yeji, and more than 500 people in Kaishunjie. The people taken in by this establishment are all new refugees from the front lines, and they are all exhausted and unable to overcome this difficult time. Please, charitable organizations, show great compassion and collect funds for relief. At the current grain prices, about one yuan per person can save them thoroughly. Your association has been enthusiastic about disaster relief in this province for many years, and has repeatedly provided assistance, either by sending personnel for relief or allocating funds for spring relief. The disaster victims have benefited greatly. The association is currently jointly operating with the Flood Relief Association for the urgent relief of bandits in Fuyang, Taihe, and Yingshang, which has not yet ended. Lihuang, Mabu, and other places were all relieved last year, and there are currently no specific funds. It is hoped that charitable colleagues at home and abroad will donate generously to save the drowning. Saving people is saving oneself, planting virtue and receiving blessings, which is immeasurable. Looking forward to it.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Gui Chongji Held a Funeral for His Deceased Father Yesterday Party and State Dignitaries All Sent Condolence Wreaths and Eulogies</h3>
<p>Gui Chongji's father, Mr. Fengnuo, was upright and devoted to public service. In his youth, when the Qing court lost power, he took the restoration of the Han Dynasty as his responsibility. In Xinhai, he participated in the restoration in Nanchang, and made many unique contributions to the Gan area campaign. After the failure of the Second Revolution, he hid in Nantong, and then went to Guangdong to participate in the National Protection War and the Northern Expedition. In the 17th year of the Republic, he retired to his hometown of Guixi, Anhui, closed his doors to guests, and did not participate in foreign affairs. However, he did his best to help local public welfare undertakings. On January 10 of this year, he passed away at his residence in Hukou, at the age of 57. Gui heard the news in Shanghai and returned to his hometown for the funeral. He chose a date for burial. Yesterday, he specially set up a spirit hall at the Shengxian Temple at the Tanshui Road intersection to hold a funeral. Party and state dignitaries, from Chairman Lin to the members of the Central Committee and the heads of various ministries and councils, all sent condolence wreaths and eulogies, which was extremely mournful and honorable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Began Household Land Survey of Fields</h3>
<p>The main control points for the land survey in Shanghai County have long been surveyed and set up. All the survey teams have been organized and established by the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau and have reported to the county to start work. Now, the county government has reported that the control group has completed the survey of five maps in the third district, including 14th grade, that is, 146 control points in the eight towns and villages of Beiqiao, Dongqiao, Xiqiao, Pingshan, Huaishu, Li Dong, Tongqiao, and Liufu, which are sufficient for the implementation of the survey. County Magistrate Pan ordered the staff to supervise the control group to continue surveying and setting up in the third district, and to implement the survey after the personnel are complete. At the same time, he ordered Sun Shiben, the district chief of the district, to contact the survey team and regularly summon the chiefs to go to the team to collect the land survey reporting forms, distribute them to the owners, fill them out according to the format, write their names on bamboo sticks, insert them into their own fields, and submit the written reporting forms with the surveying team when the surveyors arrive. He also limited the measurement. In addition, in order to facilitate the survey procedures, the county government organized a Land Consolidation Committee, which was established at a meeting the day before yesterday. Thirteen people attended, including Jiang Shijie, Kang Yongnian, Huang Xingrang, Huang Yunzhen, Chen Zheng, Zhang Guangrong, Xing Zhigang, and Sun Shiben. County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia presided over the meeting, and the first meeting was held to discuss seven cases, including the implementation of survey area standards. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant Ships Smuggling Refined Salt to Shanghai for Sale</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Orders Strict Inspection by the Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>Nanjing reports that the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing has received a report from a salt warehouse in the Shanghai Concession that Japanese merchant ships have been smuggling refined salt from Dalian, Yingkou, Liaoning, Qingdao, and other ports to Shanghai for sale. The ministry has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, which in turn sent a letter to the concession police, requesting them to assist in the arrest at any time to prevent smuggling. The ministry has also ordered the Jianghai Customs Superintendent to order the customs officers under his jurisdiction to conduct serious inspections of imported Japanese ships. If any of the above-mentioned circumstances are found, all of them should be detained and punished according to regulations.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications Has Not Issued or Inspected Japanese Seamen's Certificates</h3>
<p>Peng Hu, Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau, Claims that This Did Not Happen</p>
<p>Yesterday, various newspapers in this city reported that the Masters Association had again requested the Ministry of Communications to refuse to issue Japanese seamen's certificates. According to Peng Hu, Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the news that the association had reported that the shipping company that hired Japanese seamen had reported that the Ministry of Communications had allowed the Japanese consul's verbal request to issue seaman service certificates to Japanese seamen who had not been tested by our country, totaling 70 or 80 people, is completely untrue. Minister Zhu came to Shanghai on official business yesterday morning, and I went to visit him and asked about this matter. The minister was quite indignant because the Ministry of Communications had already clearly replied to the Masters Association that it had not issued any certificates to untested Japanese seamen, which should be reliable. Outside, there are rumors and repeated incorrect news, which is very regrettable.</p>

<h3>A Hurricane at Wusongkou Yesterday, but No Big Waves in the Huangpu River Due to Southwest Wind</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a hurricane rose again at Wusongkou. Sailing boats had difficulty traveling. Dust flew along the riverbanks in the areas of the Outer Bund and Baotaiwan.

<h3>Eight Pistols Seized From Dressing Table</h3>
<p>The Bandit's Den Was Luxuriously Furnished</p>
<p>Recently, many cases of robberies of shops and household property have occurred in the western section of the Public Concession. However, the robbers divided the stolen goods and used them up, and then hid in rooms 24 on Beile Road and the pavilion room on the third floor in the French Concession, and hid a large number of weapons, intending to continue to rob in various places. The bandit's den was furnished with copper beds, all red wood furniture, and radios, and the layout was quite luxurious. The neighbors generally considered them the residences of wealthy families, so they had lived there for several months. They did not expect that these people were bandits. But the net of heaven is vast, and the opportunity was leaked due to uneven distribution of stolen goods. Li Wenzhao, an investigator from the Chengdu Road Police Station of the Public Concession, discovered all the secret actions of the robbers and reported the above-mentioned situation to the Western detective head. He immediately dispatched Western detective head Huai Yituo, Chinese detective head Feng Boshun, investigator Ji Bingkui, and investigator Hang Falin, together with Qi Deqing, Tao Ronglin, and other investigators from the Songshan Road Police Station of the French Concession, all armed, to No. 24 Daode Lane, Beile Road, at about 3:00 PM yesterday. They first surrounded the front and back doors, and then the investigators bravely rushed into the bandit's den on the third floor and in the pavilion room, and arrested four male and female robbers, including Gu Deyu from Jiangbei.</p>
<p>Eight pistols (including one Mauser pistol) and more than one hundred bullets were seized from the dressing table on the spot.

<h3>Public Insult Case in a Divorce Case Is There Incest Between Stepmother and Son? Li Fengzhen Said She Saw It With Her Own Eyes</h3>
<p>Li Fengzhen, a woman from Wuxi, is 21 years old this year. On the 29th day of the second lunar month of last year, she married Zhang Baosheng through a matchmaker. Zhang is the adopted son of Zhang Wei, the owner of Yugushanfang in Hongxing Lane, Beinicheng Bridge. Less than two months after the marriage, the relationship broke down, and it has been difficult to reconcile since then. Li Fengzhen filed a criminal complaint against her husband, Zhang Baosheng, in the First Special District Court, accusing him of abandonment. The court ruled that the couple's lawsuit could not be filed and dismissed the complaint. Li Fengzhen hired attorney Chen Wen to request mediation for divorce in the civil court. As a result, the mediation failed, and she has now formally filed a lawsuit. She also requested to be granted litigation relief because Li Fengzhen is currently in a difficult situation and has economic difficulties. The intent of her divorce is nothing more than abandonment and abuse, saying that after Fengzhen married Baosheng, they were initially safe and sound, but less than two months later, her adopted mother-in-law, Zhang Wei, suddenly said that Fengzhen had a mental illness and insisted on sending her back to her mother's home in Wuxi to carry out the divorce. The plaintiff is a weak woman who was forced to return to her hometown. Later, she entrusted Liu Zhongming to discuss the divorce conditions with the plaintiff's father, expressing her willingness to subsidize 500 to 600 yuan as compensation for losses, but was rejected. Later, the plaintiff was sent back to her husband's home, but was denied entry and refused to cohabitate. The two sides held on, and the defendant's adoptive father came out to mediate, agreeing to rent another house for cohabitation. However, after several months, it was not implemented, and the malicious abandonment is undeniable. It was found that the defendant was adopted by his uncle. Usually, the adopted mother and adopted son were unusually affectionate. One day last year, the plaintiff saw the defendant and his adopted mother sleeping together with their necks intertwined. When she asked, the defendant said that it was necessary to be affectionate in order to inherit the property, otherwise there would be others to inherit, and it would be difficult to predict who would inherit in the future. He also opened the silver box to show that he was wealthy. The plaintiff believes that this kind of incestuous behavior not only tarnishes the family reputation, but also has a major impact on her relationship with the plaintiff. Therefore, she requested a divorce and requested the court to order the defendant to pay 9,600 yuan in alimony in one lump sum. The court has not yet scheduled a hearing based on the complaint. But one wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. Recently, Zhang Wei and Zhang Baosheng also hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint against Li Fengzhen, accusing her of fabricating facts, publicly insulting, and damaging the reputation of others, requesting that she be punished according to law. The reason is that on the afternoon of March 15, when the defendant Li Fengzhen and Baosheng were mediating a divorce in the civil court, the defendant falsely accused Zhang Wei and her adopted son Baosheng of having incestuous relations in open court. Everyone saw it clearly, publicly insulted her, and wantonly damaged the reputation of others. It was found that Zhang Wei had a husband to sleep with, Zhang Baosheng had the defendant to sleep with, there were shop assistants in the room during the day, and there were also many tenants living in the same house. It is impossible for this to happen. It is assumed that the defendant's intention is nothing more than to divorce her husband, and she does not hesitate to use such vicious methods, which has violated Article 324 of the Criminal Law on public insult and the crime of damaging the reputation of others, as well as the crime of defamation in Article 325, and requests that the sentence be increased by one-third according to the provisions of Article 328. The court approved the complaint and ordered the two parties to be summoned for trial in the Fifth Criminal Court yesterday afternoon by Judge Deng Baosun. The plaintiff, Zhang Wei, claimed that she was 50 years old. Although Zhang Baosheng was my adopted son, he had terminated his adopted son relationship with me in June of last year due to differences of opinion, as evidenced by newspaper records. It was found that the defendant and her husband Baosheng publicly insulted me in court on March 15 because of the divorce incident, saying that I had incestuous relations with my adopted son, which was purely fabricated and deliberately damaged my reputation. She should be investigated. When asked the defendant Li Fengzhen, she admitted that she had indeed said this, because she saw Zhang Wei and my husband sleeping together in the morning of a certain day last year. It was not fabricated. At the end of the debate between the lawyers of the two parties, Judge Deng ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 11th.</p>
<h3>The Assassins of Tang Jiapeng Are Sentenced to Their Original Sentences But the Reasons for the Judgment Have Been Changed Execution Will Be Carried Out After the Third Trial</h3>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, also known as A Yu, the manager of Rongji Amusement Park in the Great World, was assassinated and killed in front of the Great World at about 1:00 AM on June 18 of last year, and a stray bullet killed a pedestrian, Wu Guangcai. The police arrested Zhang Xiaosizi from Funing and Zhao Guangfu from Yangzhou, who were accomplices in the murder. They found a pistol that Zhao used to kill Tang and sent them to the Second Special District Court. After interrogation, Zhang was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Zhao was sentenced to life imprisonment. Because the two criminals declared that they were not satisfied, they filed an appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The High Court has completed the trial. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, President Guo and Judges Sun and Fan opened the court and sentenced Zhang and Zhao to their original sentences, but they changed the reasons for the judgment. After the judgment, the two criminals were still sent back to the detention center to wait for the third trial appeal period to be determined before being sent to prison to carry out the sentence.</p>
<h3>Strong Winds Yesterday Afternoon Tragedy of House Collapse in Nanlin Lane</h3>
<p>More Than 30 Years Old Front Wall Collapsed Five Buildings</p>
<p>Maid Killed Waiting for Inspection in the Rubble Five Injured Sent to Hospital for Bandaging and Then Discharged</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the strong winds, the front wall of the fifth lane of Nanlin Lane on Xinjiang Road in Zhabei collapsed, crushing the kitchen sheds in the front lane, killing one person and injuring five. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Houses Are Very Old</h3>
<p>The houses in Nanlin Lane on Xinjiang Road in Zhabei are composed of more than ten lanes and are now the property of Hengli Real Estate Company, which is run by Zhang Danru from Wuxing (now renamed Hengli Real Estate Department because it does not comply with the organization of the Company Law). The first to fifth lanes were built the earliest, more than 30 years ago, and are now dilapidated. Yesterday, the weather turned hot and strong winds broke out. At 11:00 AM, the front wall of No. 37 and No. 38 in the fifth lane was already swaying and about to fall. The residents immediately ran to tell Sun Dehui, the manager of the lane. Sun went to report to Li Runzhi, the rental accountant at No. 1069 Siwen Lane on Datong Road. Li then recruited carpenters to Nanlin Lane to prop up the wall.</p>
<h3>Wall Collapsed Five Buildings</h3>
<p>But before the carpenters were hired, at 12:45 PM, the front walls of Nos. 37 to 41 collapsed one after another, crushing the kitchen sheds of Nos. 26 and 27 in the front lane. The sound shook the neighborhood, and residents shouted and fled. Bricks and stones were scattered in a mess. After the Tianbao Lane Police Station of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau heard the news, the police chief led the police to the scene to maintain order. The Zhabei Fire Brigade also sent an ambulance to the scene.</p>
<h3>One Killed and Five Injured</h3>
<p>Police officers, firefighters, etc. rescued two injured women and three ambulances from the bricks and sent them to Binlong Hospital for treatment. They also rang the bells to summon the residents to check the number of people and whether anyone was missing. Chunxi, a 13-year-old maid from Gong Haichen's family, No. 29, Wuxi, went out to soak water before the wall collapsed and could not be found. The firefighters ordered the workers to excavate in the bricks. A body was found in front of No. 38 and behind No. 26. The face was flattened by a stone slab. The owner confirmed that it was Chunxi. The police then built a space on the body, covered it with a door panel, and waited for the local court to inspect it this morning before collecting the body.</p>
<h3>All the Injuries Are Minor</h3>
<p>Five people were injured: (1) Wang Yan, a woman from Shaoxing, No. 26, injured limbs; (2) Wang Yan's three-year-old daughter, Wang A'nan, injured her head; (3) Tian, ​​wife of Jiang Jizhang from Yuyao, No. 27, injured her foot; (4) Jiang Tian's son Zhengding (6 years old), injured his face under his left eye; (5) Wu Xiuyun, a two-year-old child from Suzhou, No. 25, injured his head. Because he was playing at No. 27, he was also injured. After being sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, they were bandaged and discharged because the injuries were not serious.</p>
<h3>Adding Cordon at the Lane Entrance</h3>
<p>After the incident, the Tianbao Lane Police Station immediately sent police to guard the entrance of the fifth lane, prohibiting idlers from entering, and instructed the residents to tidy up the bricks in front of their doors. The lane manager, Sun Dehui, hired by the owner, was sent to the First Branch of the Fourth District for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Concession Increases Bicycle License Fees City Chamber of Commerce Requests Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that on the 4th of this month, the City Bicycle Manufacturing Industry Association sent a letter (the original letter has been recorded in this newspaper on the 7th, omitting details), saying, "We have always admired your association's leadership of the business community and your utmost care. We hereby send a special letter to convey our gratitude and request that you uphold justice and quickly negotiate with the Public Concession Public Works Department and the French Concession Board of Directors, based on reason, to not only eliminate the original proposal to increase donations, but also achieve the goal of collecting the current donation rate quarterly. We also request that you forward this to the Shanghai Municipal Government for assistance, etc." After the association's receipt, it was found that the seven reasons stated by the association are extremely accurate. However, it is said that the Chinese taxpayers have consulted with the Public Works Department to exempt the increase, but the effect is equal to zero. If your government does not preside over the matter, it will not be able to mediate effectively. It is reasonable to submit a request to your government for review and approval, and to earnestly negotiate with the authorities of the two concessions in accordance with the various sections stated by the association, with the aim of achieving satisfactory results, which would be for the public good.</p>
<h3>商標法解釋問題　各工商團體開會討論</h3>
<p>New Sound Agency reports that the interpretation of the Trademark Law disregards pronunciation, contrary to the industrial sector's advocacy of considering both sound and form. This issue has been under discussion for several days and has become a significant problem. Since Mr. Hu Xiyuan published a lengthy opinion paper, strongly advocating for the consideration of both sound and form, most industrialists across the country have expressed sympathy for Mr. Hu's proposition. It is learned that the Joint Association of National Product Factories of this city and the Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Products Association will convene a committee meeting tomorrow specifically to discuss this matter. Various trade associations have also received notifications from the China General Federation of Industry, separately convening meetings. The Industry Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will also schedule a meeting of its members to discuss the interpretation of the Trademark Law. After various groups exchange opinions, as soon as Mr. Liang Shangdong, Director of the Industry and Commerce Department of the Ministry of Industry, arrives in Shanghai, the entire industrial sector's views will be provided to the relevant authorities as a reference for revising the Trademark Law.</p>
<h3>棉布市場將遷入新屋　自建新市塲佈置將完竣　籌備正式開幕暫停收貨</h3>
<p>The National Cotton Fabric Market of China on Guizhou Road in this city has completed its new building on Tianjing Road, Ji Yi Lane. The internal layout is also nearing completion. The market has been preparing for relocation in recent days and plans to suspend receiving goods from the 8th. The market began accepting cloth before the major year-end closure last year, and has been doing so for three months, having received more than 40,000 bolts of cloth. In addition, 2,000 basic machine-operated cloth weaving machines had already started weaving customized orders in order to meet market sales. Currently, the interior needs to be sorted out during the relocation and preparation for the official opening. Recently, guest merchants from this city and cotton cloth firms from various places have been sending letters urging an early opening. This is because cotton cloth firms in various places feel that it is difficult to receive goods, and the varieties are incomplete. Often, the quality is secretly reduced, and prices are chaotic, requiring a unified method to eliminate long-standing malpractices. The market's methods are perfect, the quality of all goods is excellent, and its aim is to support small machine households and promote the sales of domestic yarn. Therefore, all goods received in the future will be sold at the purchase price, so all merchants can enjoy the benefits of low prices and good quality, and the machine households can be adjusted by the market, circulate and flow, and strive for production, so life can also be stable. Domestic yarn will also be promoted day by day. It is heard that the date of the market's official opening will be decided at the upcoming board meeting, and the date should not be far off.</p>
<h3>新仁和輪殺人上訴案駁回陳葆生部分</h3>
<p>The case of the Xin Renhe steamer killing hawker Ma Koubao and five others last summer, in which the Shanghai District Court sentenced the shipowner and others to imprisonment and jointly compensated the families of the five victims with damages of 10,000 yuan, both parties expressed dissatisfaction. The prosecutor, Zhang Zi, also believed that the sentence against the two compradores, Chen Baosheng, was too lenient and filed an appeal first. Subsequently, after repeated court hearings by the Jiangsu High Court, the appeal and incidental appeal were rejected, except that Chen Baosheng was still sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for joint murder (details omitted).</p>
<p>The reasons are as follows: The appellant, Chen Baosheng, has been sentenced by this court for conspiracy to commit murder in criminal proceedings. Among the victims, one person was bound and fell into the water and died, and he failed to pay attention to supervision, so he should also be responsible for negligence. It goes without saying that he should compensate for damages. The original judgment, which allowed for consideration of the victim's status and living conditions, as well as the defendant's financial resources, and ordered joint compensation of 2,000 yuan per victim, is still appropriate. The appeal and incidental appeal in this case cannot be said to be justified and should be dismissed. The joint and several liability for compensation is stipulated in Articles 185 and 188 of the Civil Code, and it is intended to protect the interests of creditors. The incidental appellant misunderstands that joint and several liability for compensation is detrimental. Clarification is hereby given in conjunction. According to the above instructions, the judgment should be made in accordance with Article 507, Paragraph 2, and Article 384 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as stated in the main text. The court of appeal in this case is the Supreme Court. If the parties are dissatisfied with this judgment, they should file an appeal with this court within ten days from the day following the delivery of the judgment, stating the reasons for dissatisfaction in writing.</p>

<h3>假冒組織輪公司騙取押櫃鉅欵被控</h3>
<p>Deng Bingwu, a 43-year-old Hunan Changsha native residing at No. 13, Lane 835, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, previously served in the military. In August of last year, he falsely organized the Jinlong Shipping Company, and then reorganized the Tonghai Shipping Company, purchasing the Tongren Steamer to operate on the Shanghai-Fujian route. He falsely claimed that the ship was in the Philippines and would soon arrive in Shanghai, thereby defrauding Ye Zhensheng of 1,500 yuan in comprador deposit money, and忻厚德 of 1,000 yuan in supervisor deposit money. After waiting for a long time without seeing the ship arrive in Shanghai, Ye and others inquired and discovered Deng's false fraud. They demanded that Deng return the money they had paid, but Deng initially procrastinated and then avoided meeting them. Helpless, Ye and others hired lawyers Xuan Zhendong and Tang Hao to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Deng Bingwu of fraud and requesting legal action, and incidentally pursuing the recovery of the defrauded money through civil proceedings. According to the complaint, Judge Wu Fanglian repeatedly summoned Deng to court, but the defendant only sent a lawyer to court for defense, and the defendant himself avoided appearing in court. After failing to arrest him, the plaintiffs requested the issuance of an arrest warrant to be handed over to the police for investigation and arrest. Zhou Yaoting, the deputy controller of the special agency of the French Concession Police Department, discovered that Deng was hiding in the home of his friend Ni Jichen at No. 9, Meinanfang, Maubert Road, Public Concession. On the night of the day before yesterday, he took the No. 1 arrest warrant issued by the Second Special Court on January 18 of this year and reported to the Xinzha Police Department to dispatch detectives to secretly go to the address and arrest Deng, returning him to the police department. The next day, he was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case and presented the arrest warrant, requesting a postponement and return to the court for interrogation. Judge Sun Pengxian verified the report and briefly questioned the defendant. The defendant's lawyer claimed that the defendant was a current military officer and requested bail. The court refused and ordered a postponement of ten days for Judge Wu to hear the case. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>南市國貨商塲逐步擴充</h3>
<p>開幕十八日營業五六萬</p>
<p>The Nanshi National Products Emporium, sponsored by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, has been open since March 21, only eighteen days ago. The development of business has exceeded expectations. According to the director of the emporium, Yang Zhenxin, the business on the opening day was more than 5,000 yuan, and since then it has been 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per day. Up to today, the total is more than 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Because the Nanshi district has many middle- and upper-class residences and is a school area, the sales of candy, enamel, etc. are the highest. Second, there are rattan goods and miscellaneous items. However, silk and satin are the least. The reason is that there are many foreign goods shops in the Xiaodongmen area. At present, 28 manufacturers have participated in this emporium. In the future, the plan is to gradually expand. During this Children's Day, a children's area has been specially opened on the third floor, which is expected to be on display for two weeks. It is also planned to set up an amusement park so that tourists have a place to entertain themselves.</p>

<h3>柴炭號業同業公會籌備會議</h3>
<p>The firewood and charcoal industry, in view of the sluggish market, sluggish business, rising costs, and infighting among colleagues, initiated the organization of a trade association by the Zhabei firewood and charcoal dealers in 1931, and requested permission from the Municipal Party Department.

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>The Marriage Problem Presented in "Small Ten Years" (2)</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Liu Hanyun raised two doubts about the marriage problem in Ye Yongzhen's novel "Small Ten Years." This section will answer Mr. Liu's doubts separately. - Editor</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the opinions of the two families you mentioned.</p>
<p>The "Brave One" believes that young people must be uncompromising and fight against the environment, especially starting with that business-like marriage. Yes, in many recent literary works, escaping the shackles of old-fashioned marriage is often used as a portrayal of revolutionary youth. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this. Those with the courage to move forward should never consider "that wife in the same bed" and hinder their own future. However, if this is written as the main lesson for solving marriage, the topic is somewhat excessive. May I ask, does simply abandoning that wife in the same bed overthrow the business-like marriage? Does it break through the darkness and achieve happiness? Obviously, it is not that simple.</p>
<p>The "Compromiser" believes that love in capitalist society is unreliable. Rather than suffering the pain of "lost love" and "divorce," it is better to have a country girl. This is also the actual situation, but this is close to the view of "throwing the baby out with the bathwater." The reform of the marriage system is governed by society, and no one has the power to drag the progressive society back to its original position. You are afraid of pain and dare not try love. However, marriage without love cannot only give you spiritual comfort, but also become a burden in your life. Then how will you explain it? Of course, love can be created, as Mr. Liu is an example, but love cannot be created unconditionally. Can a big capitalist create love with a stupid country girl? Can a fashionable lady create love with a worker covered in sweat? Even if there is, it is abnormal, exceptional, and cannot be used as the basis for solving all marriage problems. Obviously, the problem raised by the "Compromiser" is not the problem of love itself, but the problem of the object of love. If you want to solve marriage according to this claim, it is equivalent to not solving it.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the opinions of these two families are incorrect. This incorrectness is because they are all based on the supremacy of love, and I am willing to dig out the root of the problem.</p>
<p>How should we solve this contradiction?</p>
<p>The answer is: We should seek solutions from our own lives and from our own tasks for society; that is to say, whether for old-fashioned marriage or new love, our choice should be determined by what helps our lives or at least does not hinder our lives. Love is not the primary meaning of life, but is in a subordinate position.</p>
<p>We are in a transitional era between the new and the old. The new social system has not been established, and the old one is collapsing irretrievably. We cannot wait, and we cannot blindly rush forward. Our main task is how we can use our power to promote the new society, so as to accelerate the completion of marriage based on true love in the new society. We want to break the old-fashioned marriage; but if that wife in the same bed does not hinder our current career, and can even live with us on the same lifeline, then we don't necessarily have to divorce. We need free love, but if it is just for the false name of love, for the temptation of fashion, and the object we know is incompatible with our life, then we should still go back to our old wife; conversely, if our lover can completely stand on the same life base as us, and our lover can help us complete our social tasks, then even if our old wife is as beautiful as a flower, even if it means breaking with our family, we cannot care about it. Kollontai's view of love starts from this point of view. He does not advocate promiscuity, but says that in the tide of the Great Revolution, you should not hinder your main work due to the love problem.</p>
<p>Of course, people are emotional animals. What we say may be too focused on reason and neglect emotion. However, emotion is not a product of anything else, but is also produced from life. If life is not in tune, love will never be strong. Here, we can give an example. There is a book by the Soviet Romanov called "Division of Love," which describes a peasant after the revolution who goes to work in the city. At this time, his social status is improved, so he wants to try love. He tries to forget his country wife and lives with a bourgeois lady. At first, they can get along with each other, but after a long time, the lady, although she is a lady of a declining class, her class inferiority is still revealed at any time. She wants to dance, she wants to have fun: this bothers the rude farmer who only knows how to work. As a result, he finally cannot stand the trouble and returns to his hardworking country wife. After reading it, you should understand what love is all about.</p>
<p>In short, the breaking of the old marriage system must start with the transformation of the entire society, and our current marriage problem should be based on the basis of common life, so as to help achieve or not hinder our future.</p>

<p>— Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Later, they came to a deserted palace. Suddenly, she sighed to herself in an extremely low voice. Because I was closely following behind her shoulder, I could easily hear her say:</p>
<p>"This throne is where our son sat during his coronation! We can still see him sitting there. - The scene is the same as yesterday - He was wearing a full set of the most noble clothes."</p>
<p>Her sigh was so serene, and her thoughts were stirred by the memorable coronation, constantly rising and falling. When this coronation was held, it was also the starting point of her third regency. All these situations are just like yesterday. And the place where she is standing now is the place where she stood yesterday! She stared at the throne where her baby was crowned, without blinking her eyes, without making a sound for a long time, and without looking back at the row of followers arranged behind her. She just lowered her head, brushed past the first lady-in-waiting, until the last little eunuch, and went to another palace.</p>
<p>She pointed to another palace and told us that this was where Emperor Xianfeng's body was placed after his death. She spoke so sincerely that we seemed to see a dead Emperor Xianfeng lying in the place she was pointing at. And the heavy burden he left behind had to be borne by his delicate and beloved concubine - the gentle old woman in front of us.</p>
<p>Before coming here, the Empress Dowager had told me many stories about her own history. Now, she pointed out to me one by one the locations where the most prosperous and happiest events of the past took place. How sad this is for her! But when we later left the Rehe Palace and returned to Beijing, and walked into the gate of the Summer Palace, these painful traces were easily thrown out of our brains, just like turning over a page of history; and from then on, this part of the history would never be read again!

<h3>Call</h3>
<p>— Xu Haowu</p>
<p>After eating, with nothing to do, I slowly walked along Avenue Edward VII. Driven by curiosity, I stopped to watch a fortune-telling stall by the roadside.</p>
<p>I don't know if the stall had just been set up, and business hadn't started yet, so there was no one standing around the stall except me and the "fortune teller" facing each other. "Fortune telling is lifeless."</p>
<p>Unhurriedly, I stood firm, ground the ink for a while; then picked up the brush dipped in ink, stuffed the end of the brush into my mouth, gently bit it, and used my mouth instead of my hand to write "Negotiating prices down five places."</p>
<p>People gradually gathered around.</p>
<p>The "fortune teller" put down the brush, used the tip of his index finger, coated with ink, and lightly drew a few birds with wings ready to fly next to the word; the bird's beak was drawn with un-inked nails, long and thin, how lifelike!</p>
<p>At this time, the people gathered around were very crowded; and the stool next to the stall, reserved for customers to sit on, had been occupied first by someone who was quick on their feet.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, the "art" of fortune telling is not based on mouth writing and finger painting at all, but it's like the gong and drum used to attract attention by street performers; stores advertising by broadcasting on the radio: "Those who want to be recognized" blowing conch shells to fish for fame; fortune-telling stalls, in addition to "criticizing based on the situation" and "not mincing words," should naturally also show off a little bit, and have the ability to attract the public, otherwise, a poor scholar sitting there coldly, no matter how knowledgeable you are, is not enough to get passers-by to look at you!</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>— Xu Yueling</p>
<p>Spring has secretly come to the world!</p>
<p>These days, the sun is so warm, and people walking on the road are so soft that they seem to have lost their senses: the young people's hearts are so anxious, spring wind, it did not bring "their expectations," only some excitement and boredom intertwined in their hearts, heavy, drowsy, wrapping each active "heart," tightly wrapped.</p>
<p>Our noble girl, living deep in a magnificent red building, the taste of "chocolate" has become bitter, and the yin and yang theories in the lecture hall, or, listening to blind fortune-tellers may be more fun. Tender, who wants to move around? She resents the coming of spring for not dressing up so gorgeously and intoxicatingly, making her empty heart always so empty!</p>
<p>The collection of "Human Art," which she usually loves the most, has become disgusting these days, and she throws it on the ground hatefully; at the moment, she needs stimulation, strong stimulation. Occasionally, she remembers Li Houzhu's "Flowers are bright and the moon is dark, light fog flies, today is a good day to go to the lover's side..." A soft voice escaped from her lips.</p>
<p>Look! Our girl is intoxicated, leisurely intoxicated in the embrace of spring.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 27:  Bedroom Complaints Silently Dissipated, Compassionate Thoughts were Truly Felt; Leisurely Knowing After Being Drunk, Old Matters were Hard to Forget</p>
<p>After all, a mother loves her daughter. Jiang didn’t alarm anyone, and quietly entered the room. Seeing Guizhi like this, she supported herself on the edge of the bed, stretched her head, and looked at Guizhi's face, saying: "Child, what's wrong with you again?" Her voice was both soft and gentle, with a hint of wry smile on her face. Seeing this situation, Guizhi quickly put down her pillow and laughed, "Look, isn't this strange? I didn't sleep on the pillow last night, and my eyes are swollen. How can I see people today?" Jiang said, "Are they swollen from sleeping? I don't think so, right?" Guizhi laughed, "Then, you must say I cried them swollen. I'm not a baby still wanting milk, what would I be crying about all night long?" Seeing that she was unwilling to admit it, Jiang naturally knew she had her own distress. Even if she told her straight out, she would only offer empty comfort, which wouldn't alleviate her pain. So she said, "If that's the case, just lie down for a while longer. Why bother getting up?" Guizhi said, "I'm really too embarrassed to see people with these eyes. I'll just stay in bed at home today. Please ask Xiaolin to take care of Grandpa's affairs." Jiang didn't want Zhao Weng to see her eyes so swollen. Indeed, she lowered the curtain for Guizhi and went to arrange the household affairs. Guizhi sat alone in the bedroom. Having nothing to dispel her loneliness, she couldn’t help but think. Thinking about herself, then thinking about Huang Manying, she thought, "When I saw her talking with her boyfriend, I couldn't shake it off for two or three days. I wonder if she still thinks about it in her heart after I bumped into their business?  When girls and their lovers talk, happiness is real happiness, but fear is also real fear. I remember when I first went to Ganji's shop to drink milk tea and talk, my heart was pounding. When I got home and saw my mother, my face turned red. I don't know why, but it's like wearing thin clothes in the dead of winter, shivering from the heart." (357)</p>
<p>Humorous Talk</p>
<h3>Tramp</h3>
<p>— Cao Wennan</p>
<p>In Paris, a policeman caught a tramp and took him to the police station. The tramp could not speak a word of French (he could only speak German), and the judge did not understand German; so he asked a translator to inquire.</p>
<p>"Where were you born?" the judge asked him.</p>
<p>"In Paris."</p>
<p>"In Paris? Then you are French..."</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Judge, I am not French, I am German."</p>
<p>"But, because you were born in France, of course you are French!"</p>
<p>"Why? According to you, if I were born in a stable, wouldn't I have to become a horse?"</p>
<h3>According to the Bible</h3>
<p>King Francis I of France</p>
<p>Once visited Pope Leo X in Rome. He saw the extreme luxury of the papal palace and involuntarily said: "According to the Bible, the life of a religious leader should be simple and austere." "Indeed," said the Pope, "but at that time, the king was still living a nomadic life."</p>
<p>Rambling Talk</p>
<h3>Study of Inkstones (19)</h3>
<p>— Bored Guest</p>
<p>Overview of She Inkstones</p>
<p>3.  Meizi (Eyebrow) Stone</p>
<p>I've been talking about these boring, tasteless stones every day. Readers must be tired of it. Today, I'm talking about Meizi Stone. The meaning of the two characters "Meizi" at the time was simply because the stone pattern resembled a person's eyebrows. However, general romantic scholars thought of "beautiful forehead and moth eyebrows" and "lightly painted moth eyebrows" (those with slender and long eyebrow patterns are called moth eyebrow stones), considering it as lovely as a beauty. Therefore, the poems praising Meizi Inkstones were made with extra enthusiasm. Su Dongpo has a Meizi Inkstone song, which is the most interesting and representative of the times. It is recorded below to reconcile the taste of readers. The song says,</p>
<p>"Don't you see the Chengdu painter draw ten eyebrows,</p>
<p>Horizontal clouds and crescent moons compete for novelty.</p>
<p>Travelers point to the lightly frowning place,</p>
<p>In the middle, the Hu horses of Yuyang neigh.</p>
<p>Also, don't you see the grandson's green window horizontally double green,</p>
<p>The intestines are broken, floating in the sky, distant mountain colors.</p>
<p>The life of a scholar is not worth discussing,</p>
<p>Sitting and spending a thousand gold to buy thirst quenching.</p>
<p>Since then, the chaos has worried the heavens,</p>
<p>Banished to your family's book inkstone.</p>
<p>Small window, empty curtain, charming each other,</p>
<p>Let the lord's dawn dream produce spring red.</p>
<p>Viya layman talks about emptiness,</p>
<p>Habitual karma is empty, flowers do not stay.</p>
<p>Try to teach the heavenly women to grind lead,</p>
<p>Thousands of verses pour out without a single word."</p>
<p>What kind of feelings do you readers have after reading this? Master Su also has a poem about exchanging a precious sword for Zhang Jin's Longwei Inkstone, which is also very elegant. But I urgently need to talk about the ruthless stubborn stone, so I have to reluctantly give it up. Meizi patterned stones were therefore more respected in the Song Dynasty. Their color is either cyan or purple. Short and clustered eyebrows are like reclining silkworms and rhino patterns. Long and wide ones are like tiger stripe patterns. The most exquisite is the wild goose gathering lake, like eyebrows facing each other. There are also twelve types to distinguish their names.</p>
<p>Golden Flower Meizi: Has golden flowers scattered on it</p>
<p>Golden Halo Meizi: The inkstone surface has a golden halo like clouds</p>
<p>Golden Star Meizi: Eyebrow patterns are sparse with two or three golden stars</p>
<p>Facing Eyebrow Meizi: Eyebrows are formed in pairs, the most clean and moist</p>
<p>Short Eyebrow Meizi: Eyebrows are short and scattered, not gathered in one place</p>
<p>Long Eyebrow Meizi: The inkstone surface has three or several long two or three inches</p>
<p>Clustered Eyebrow Meizi: Fine lines densely gathered in one place</p>
<p>Wide Eyebrow Meizi: Has vitality like a leopard pattern</p>
<p>Wild Goose Lake Meizi: Shaped like a flock of wild geese flying over the sea</p>
<p>Brocade Pleated Eyebrow Meizi: Stone halo like clouds and Xia, quite gorgeous</p>
<p>Green Bean Eyebrow Meizi: Eyebrow pattern has green bean-sized spots</p>
<p>Eel Belly Meizi: Eyebrows are sparse in color like eel belly</p>
<p>The Meizi Pit also has a kind of water wave pattern. The stone texture is firm and delicate, shaped like a slight breeze brushing the waves, with ripples like weaving, also a beautiful pattern.</p>
<p>The above is based on Inkstone Notes. However, according to other books, the Shui Xuan Pit outside the Meizi Pit also has many golden patterned eyebrows, cyan in color, such as dancing cranes, such as longevity immortals, such as mandarin ducks, such as withered tree immortals, such as morning glow cloud steaming, such as cold geese in the lake, such as double fish squatting on rafters, such as kettles and bottles, such as reclining silkworms, such as ascending bucket shapes.</p>
<p>Those fond of doing good deeds in the Song Dynasty imaged their shapes and made various kinds of names.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the Lu Pit, which produces a kind of cyan-green haloed eyebrow patterned twill, all with golden stars. According to the Japanese Bando, the presence or absence of golden stars is irrelevant, because golden stars have hidden and obvious. If there is a kind of diabase that floats on the stone surface, it will emit a treasured light, and those hidden in the middle will not be seen. However, its stone quality must be the same tender and clean. Also, the Jiyuan Pit stone and the Lu Pit are equally shiny and moist, and are both called excellent products, but Jiyuan only has one or two silky soft lines, and there are very few twill eyebrow patterns.</p>

<h3>Far Eastern Games to Hold Executive Committee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Preliminary Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss Agenda</p>
<p>Content Does Not Discuss the Issue of the Puppet State's Participation</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Games Executive Committee Meeting (previously rumored to be a roundtable meeting, called by the Philippine Athletic Association by letter last month) is being held in Shanghai. Representatives from Japan and the Philippines have arrived in port one after another. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Shen Siliang, the main member of the Chinese Progress Association, visited and held a preliminary meeting at the Cathay Hotel. The three parties decided on the order of today's meeting and the candidates for chairman, etc., as listed below:</p>

Ratify the increase in the number of registrations for football and basketball;</p>
<p>Attached: Representatives attending today's meeting: China: Hao Gengsheng, Cao Yunxiang, Shen Siliang; Japan: Yamamoto, Matsuzawa, Ishii; Philippines: Dr. Tan</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Express Intense Opposition</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines are particularly vocal in their opposition to the puppet Manchukuo's participation as the roundtable meeting is about to open. Yesterday, this newspaper received another telegram from overseas Chinese in the Philippines, which read, "To the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper Office, transferred to the Chinese National Sports Progress Association, Japan insists on advocating that the puppet state participate in the Far Eastern Games, which is clearly forcing us to recognize the puppet state. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines refuse to the end, Philippine Overseas Chinese kowtow." Also, yesterday, the Shanghai Times News Agency received a telegram from the Forward Daily in the city, which read, "To the Shanghai Times News Agency, yesterday, the joint meeting of all overseas Chinese community organizations in Quanzhou unanimously insisted on resolutely rejecting Japan's forcing the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the Far Eastern Games and has prepared the strength to deal with this incident. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. Please convey to the Journalists Association a request for assistance, Forward Daily Kowtows."</p>
<h3>Our Country Will Never Yield</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Sports Progress Association, apart from the fact that there is no such proposal in the roundtable meeting, and no matter how cunning the Japanese are, our side will adhere to the consistent policy of not humiliating the country and not associating with puppets. The facts will prove it in the future. Overseas Chinese love the motherland, and their enthusiasm is commendable. The reason why they have repeatedly sent telegrams to express their views must be due to Japanese propaganda. We should be more vigilant and strive for national dignity to comfort the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Hao Gengsheng, the sports supervisor of the Ministry of Education, is still in Peiping to inspect the sports of colleges and universities above the specialty level in Peiping. There is a letter to the Ministry of Education saying that he will go to Baoding from Peiping on the 8th to inspect. He will not be able to attend the roundtable meeting of the Far Eastern Games on the 9th. It is heard that he has entrusted a friend in Shanghai to participate as a nearby representative.</p>

<h3>Yu You B Wins Against Jewish Team, Wins Junior Cup; In the First Half, Jewish Team Led 3-2; Final Result, Yu You Wins 5-3 to Win the Championship; The Only Glorious Record of Chinese Football This Season</h3>
<p>This year's Western League Football has ended yesterday. In the A Group final game between Yu You A and the Western Police, Yu You won by default due to the Western Police's forfeiture. In the Junior Cup final, Yu You B faced the Jewish team. The game was held at the Yiyuan yesterday. The two teams had a previous battle for 120 minutes (the time was extended) without a winner. The two sides worked hard again yesterday. Yu You's momentum was extremely strong when they took the field. Two goals were scored in no time. Unexpectedly, the defender Zhang Rong was injured in his right arm and left the field, causing the Jewish left inside forward to score three goals in a row. Yu You fought back hard with the strength of ten people and scored three goals to defeat the Jewish team with 5-3, winning the Junior Cup, opening the first sound of Chinese people winning this championship and becoming the only glorious memory for Chinese football this season. The A group order has ended, and the results are as follows:</p>

<h3>Yu You Has Strong Momentum, Scores Two Goals in a Row</h3>
<p>Ma Xianer blew the whistle to start the war. With the help of the wind, Yu You repeatedly launched attacks on the eastern suburbs. Shen Shiqi passed the low line in the middle. Hollstein lost it in front, and Greenburg lost it again. Hu Youcheng sat back and reaped the benefits and shot the ball into the net. Before long, Shen Xiangui and Xu Wenkui passed to the low line to each other, which was forced into a corner kick by the enemy defender. Xiao Shen opened to the center. Hu Youcheng wanted to shoot but failed. Shen Shiqi got the advantage and broke into the goal again. The audience was very happy and wished Yu You could win.</p>
<h3>Jewish Counterattack, Three Cities Fall in a Row</h3>
<p>At this moment, the Jewish counterattack was fierce. Yu You's three passes were in critical condition. Zhang Rong was eager to save the ball and injured his right arm. He was helped out of the field. Yu You urgently transferred Shen Xiangui back to defense to fill the gap. The Jewish took the opportunity to plunder and loot. L. Greenburg, with the help of Pengchek, strode into the goal. Although Yang Jinming had patted it, it still slipped into the bottom of the net, making it two to one. Before long, L. Greenburg made a low shot with a steep foot at the 20-yard mark, creating a tie. At this time, Yu You was in a predicament, unable to attack or defend. L. Greenburg broke into the crowd alone, creating a three-to-two advantage and a come-from-behind advantage.</p>
<h3>Final Efforts to Win the Championship</h3>
<p>In the second half, Yu You has embraced the ambition of not winning but dying, giving up conservatism, and the front line is attacking fiercely. Shen Shiqi is as fast as a fly. As soon as he gets a gap, he drills to the 20-yard mark and hits the vital point with a bang, making it another tie. Three minutes later, Hu Youcheng's blessing arrived (because Shen Shiqi hooked it, he rushed straight in, and Dieter Lu came out too early, and the two did not meet, so Hu Anran pushed it into the door, making it four to three. Five minutes later, Cheng Yize turned around and shot hard on the free-kick line, and Dieter Lu was caught off guard, making it a score of five to three. Although the Jewish team wanted to restore the rivers and mountains, Yu You had the victory in hand and of course refused to let people. The war ended at the rest time, and there was no development in the end. Yu You then won the championship.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong International Cup Football Match, Welsh Beat Chinese United 3-1, Li Huitang and Others' Assistance Proved Ineffective</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) This year's annual International Charity Cup Football Tournament was held in the final at the Hong Kong Club Stadium in Happy Valley at 3:30 PM on the 2nd of this month. It was found that the teams with the right to the final were the Chinese team and the Welsh team. These two Chinese and Western teams are the strongest in Hong Kong. After a fierce battle of 90 minutes, the Welsh team beat the Chinese team 3-1, winning this year's International Cup Championship. It is indeed extremely glorious. It is found that the Welsh team has been in Hong Kong for several years. When it first arrived in Hong Kong, it was known as a strong team. However, the team has been excluded from the door for all championships except for once touching the Special Silver Medal, and it has been humiliated by the Chinese team many times. It is also unfortunate for the team. When the Chinese team failed this year, the team created an unprecedented creation since its arrival in Hong Kong. The Special Silver Medal and the International Cup have both fallen into the hands of the team. The ordinary cup official competition that is about to end is also the team's.</p>
<p>At half past three in the afternoon, the players of the two teams appeared on the field in the drizzling rain to try their skills. Because it had been raining continuously for days, the grass field was completely wet and muddy, and the behavior was abnormal. When the referee Xunzizhi blew the whistle to start the game, both sides launched fierce attacks. Li Huitang of the Chinese team shot and missed the goal and retreated. The Welsh team took the opportunity to counterattack. Palmer made a long shot and went high. At that time, there were dangerous signs in front of both sides' goals. After a long hard battle, the Welsh team suddenly took advantage of the Chinese team's advancing troops and launched a counterattack. The Chinese team's defense was empty. Liu Mao had difficulty supporting it alone. He was driven straight in. When he was a few yards away from the goal, Liu and the Welsh team's players were entangled. The ball rolled over, and Bao rushed out and kicked the ball into the net with the body of two balls. The Chinese team first announced the loss. The five forwards had to work hard to counterattack. They united to launch a large-scale attack and succeeded in shooting the goal many times, but it was saved by the unknown Smith. The Chinese team's attack was unsuccessful. The Welsh team took advantage of the situation and entered again. Matais threw over Li Guowei and passed the ball in the middle. The Chinese team's rear was in chaos. Zhong Shi easily passed the ball into the net, making the score two to zero at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, Ou Bingming got the chance to shoot first, but it was too weak and was easily saved by Smith again. He Jiaqiang also shot the ball, but it was saved. The Chinese team was quite active at this time, but after five minutes, it went down again and was besieged by the Welsh team, losing corner kicks in a row. Fortunately, he managed to save the emergency. He Zuoxian suddenly broke through and sent the ball forward. He Jiaqiang passed it to Li Huitang. Li Nong passed Moro and shot the ball into the net, making the score two to one. The Chinese team's hope increased. After a fierce attack, the rear was besieged again. Under severe circumstances, another goal was shoveled in, making the score three to one. The Welsh team won. After the game, Mrs. Wilson presented the awards and dispersed with cheers. The lineup of both sides is listed below:</p>

<h3>Kaitai Cup Second Final, Sino-English Beat Five Continents 3-2; Sterling Cup Awarded by Mrs. Adelaide Harden</h3>
<p>At 7:00 AM yesterday, China-England and Five Continents played the second final of the Kaitai Cup at the football field (referee Mr. Le Xiurong, linesmen Kai Yuan and Li Baojun). In the first half, both sides covered up the case, and there was nothing to gain. After the lemon time, Li Zhixiang of the Five Continents team opened the scoring first, and the situation suddenly became tense. The Sino-English team counterattacked once, and Che Cheng made a tie. The Five Continents team was unwilling to give in and launched a full-scale attack. Zhang Zhiming broke the enemy's goal again, taking the lead with two to one. The Sino-English team did not give up, and borrowed from the back city again. Yu Zhenyue cut off the pass and went deep, winning two goals in a row. As a result, they beat the Five Continents team 3-2. The two teams will meet again at the football field at 7:00 AM on the 15th for the final final.

<p>Liang Huasheng, the division commander of the 92nd Division of the Army, has been striving for the physical education of officers and soldiers since taking office, and hired Zhu Jiayou as the general instructor. In December last year, a grand sports meeting was held in Yongfeng for three days. At that time, it was praised by all sectors of society and aroused the common attention of friendly forces to physical education. It was very popular for a while. As usual, the division commander led the officers and soldiers to practice various sports in their spare time for a long time without interruption. When this year's Spring Festival arrived again, the division commander organized the Zhongzheng Cup Basketball Championship Tournament to improve the basketball skills of officers and soldiers, divided into officer and soldier groups, which was held in Tengyou, Gannan on March 21 and 22. It was learned that the 552nd Regiment won the championship in the officer group, and the 549th Regiment won the championship in the soldier group. The division commander awarded each a silver cup as encouragement.</p>
<h3>The East Asia Games, Day Two</h3>
<p>The Shanghai East Asia Physical Education School held its Spring Sports Meet at the China Athletic Field, as reported yesterday. Yesterday consisted mostly of finals. The first event was the high hurdles final. As soon as the hurdles were set up, a gust of wind blew them all down. The athletes ran against the wind, exerting their legs in a desperate sprint, but were hampered by the wind, greatly affecting their performance.

<h3>Report on the Ministry of Education's Inspection of Shandong Education by Personnel Sent to Other Provinces</h3>
<p>The inspection report on Shandong Province's education by personnel sent by the Ministry of Education, which was previously submitted to the Ministry, and the opinions on the improvements that should be made to Shandong's education in that report, are now being published by the Ministry as follows:</p>
<p>1.	The work of the departments and divisions of the Department of Education is tense. In recent years, the reorganization and transformation of education in the entire province have also been quite effective. However, after all county education bureaus were uniformly changed to the fifth section of the county government, they have been subject to many restrictions in their work, resulting in a decrease in efficiency compared to before, which is a great regret. Efforts should be made to improve this urgently.</p>
<p>2.	The proportion of regular expenses for provincial secondary schools used for teaching equipment is below 4%, while the proportion used for teachers' salaries is above 80%. This distribution does not comply with the regulations for middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools, and should be improved separately to emphasize compliance with regulations.</p>
<p>3.	The 51 normal training institutes run by various counties have unsuitable enrollment qualifications, graduation years, curriculum, and teaching, and should be reorganized, raised in level, and enriched in content in accordance with the regulations for normal schools, in order to cultivate elementary school teachers who are currently needed in various localities.</p>
<p>4.	Many provincial vocational schools have been closed, and there are currently only four. The proportion of secondary education funds occupied by these schools is far from the standards set by the Ministry. The plan to establish 20 schools, as decided by the Shandong Provincial Education Design Committee in its 17th year, should be followed immediately, and the 13 most important schools should be established in stages before the 26th year, with special emphasis on agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, ceramics, and other subjects to suit the actual needs of the province.</p>
<p>5.	The vocational schools run by various counties are mostly agricultural, sericultural, commercial, and textile dyeing departments. The curriculum and equipment of vocational supplementary schools are too simple, and the internship time is too short, which is a major shortcoming. The Department of Education should plan and supervise them to innovate.</p>
<p>6.	Some principals of provincial secondary schools do not concurrently teach classes, while others teach classes but receive separate salaries. This is sufficient to affect the distribution of the entire budget and should be handled in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry.</p>
<p>7.	If there are more than two classes of students in the same grade in secondary schools, the classes are divided based on age, which is meaningless. They should be divided based on ability, which is more appropriate.</p>
<p>8.	Many normal school graduates are unwilling to serve in rural areas, and are not happy to take teaching positions even in smaller towns. Therefore, many normal school graduates have not served, which is a great loss to the country and individuals. The provisions of Article 91 of the Normal School Regulations should be followed immediately, and each graduating class should be assigned by the educational administrative organs to various places to serve as elementary school or equivalent school teachers, and the service should be strictly supervised in accordance with the provisions of Articles 90 and 93, in order to comply with the original intention of the state in establishing normal schools.</p>
<p>9.	In secondary schools, there is too little time for experiments in physics, chemistry, and biology, and the teaching materials for manual labor classes are too vague. The plan should be improved in a practical way, and the equipment for each item should be enriched separately to facilitate teaching.</p>
<p>10. According to statistics, infant education in the province has shown a gradual development trend, but plans should be made urgently to enrich equipment, improve teaching methods, save expenses, and increase the number of classes so that more children who have not reached school age can have the opportunity to attend school. In addition, special attention should also be paid to the care of children.</p>
<p>11. The teaching methods in elementary schools are mostly inappropriate, resulting in disorderly and noisy classrooms, which are common. The arrangement and distribution of homework in multi-grade classes are also mostly inconsistent with educational principles and should be studied and improved urgently.</p>
<p>12. The number of elementary school teachers and staff should be reduced as appropriate. The principal or director should teach classes in accordance with the regulations, to avoid paying extra salaries and wasting public funds.</p>
<p>13. Catholicism and other churches mostly regard Shandong as a paradise for missionary work in North China. Churches are everywhere, and schools are widely distributed with them, but most have not followed the Ministry's regulations to complete the registration procedures and should be strictly investigated, thoroughly rectified, and brought into compliance with the standards.</p>
<p>14. The Department has been able to pay attention to the training of social education talents and the reorganization of social education institutions, but the social education funding has been decreasing year by year since the 18th year. The budget for the 21st year was 173,155 yuan, accounting for 5.85% of the total education expenses, and the budget for the 22nd year was only 123,441 yuan, with an even smaller percentage. Efforts should be made to increase funding to promote development.</p>
<p>15. The total amount of social education funds in various counties has reached more than 420,000 yuan, with an average of 3,954 yuan per county. The percentage of the total education funds occupied by these funds averages 9.5%, and 95 counties have more than 10%. The foundation for funding is still considerable, but the social education undertakings in various counties should be expanded in scope and enriched in content.</p>
<h3>A Record of the China Vocational Education Society's Inspection in Japan (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>(Nagasaki Correspondence) The China Vocational Education Society was founded in the 15th year of the Republic of China by the initiation of Mr. Chen Heqin and Mr. Dong Renjian, and is a rare primary education research organization in the country. It currently has over a thousand members scattered throughout the country. For the sake of mutual learning and research, the Society specially organized a foreign inspection group to attack the stone of other mountains. This trip to Japan is the first time to break the ground, so how can there be no record? Now, I will dip my pen to describe the essentials of my impressions of the trip to Japan for the reference of the people of the country.</p>
<h3>The Hardships and Joys of the Journey</h3>
<p>For this trip, some colleagues have been planning for three or four years, and some have been preparing for seven or eight years, and now they have finally been able to fulfill their wishes. However, when they were about to leave, Mr. Wu Xiu stopped because his child was sick, which shows that it is not easy to leave home. Therefore, on April 1st, the colleagues boarded the Shanghai Maru and set off. Friends who went to the Huishan Wharf were endless. At 9 o'clock, a whistle announced the beginning of the voyage. The hearts of the departing people were filled with countless feelings of regret. As the boat left the shore and gradually moved away, they looked back at the people who were sending them off, still standing there waving their handkerchiefs and hats. At this time, red and green paper strips flew across the river, and the strands of affection of the soul-destroying people floated and sank in their melancholy hearts, muttering to each other.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat was anchored, the luggage was inspected. First, we were asked to fill out a "Declaration Form for Items Carried by Passengers", in which all items in the boxes had to be filled in one by one. Since we were a group, we requested to be exempt from the inspection, but we were not successful. However, someone was sent to the cabin to take a look and paste a paper from the Kobe Customs Supervisory Department on each piece of luggage, which was much more preferential than individual tourists.</p>
<p>Those with more than 20 books must fill out a form for detailed inspection. Plant seeds are strictly prohibited, one fearing the destruction of their plant eugenics, and the other fearing the entry of microorganisms when landing. Each guest is allowed to carry no more than 100 cigarettes and must fill out a "Passenger's Tobacco Form for Personal Use." The form is rectangular and contains the ship name, name, port of embarkation, date, age, and various tobacco names, such as paper-rolled tobacco, leaf-rolled tobacco, carved tobacco, and others. After the form is filled out, the cigarettes are attached to the inspection, stamped for approval, and then used. It is really annoying. Then, a friend told us that Japanese cigarettes are state-owned and sold by a monopoly bureau. Foreign guests carry many cigarettes, which harms their national economy. The journey was calm, the sky was high and the sun was bright. We went to the deck to breathe fresh air, expose ourselves to the sun's ultraviolet rays, and chatted in groups, admiring the sand gulls and looking at the color of the water and the sky. The joy was endless. Looking west at our homeland, we all yearned for the green mountains.</p>
<p>The color of the water changed from yellow to green to black. As the wind and waves rose slightly, the ship inevitably swayed. Then, those who were seasick got up one after another and lay down without daring to move. They did not eat dinner and were as sick as if they had a serious illness, only praying for the arrival of the god of sleep to avoid the pain of dizziness and vomiting.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Nagasaki</h3>
<p>After 14 hours of sailing, Nagasaki was in sight. Japanese time is one hour faster than our country. At 12:15 on April 2 (that is, 11:15 in our country), we arrived safely in Nagasaki. The Port of Nagasaki is a naturally good military port, shaped like a concave character, with winding mountains and lush greenery. The mountains are like Putuo Mountain and Mogan Mountain in our country, exquisite and elegant, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Nagasaki is an ancient heroic name, so the place is named after the person's name. It opened as a port in the second year of Genki. Before the Meiji Restoration, it was one of Japan's leading foreign trade ports. Now that ports such as Osaka and Kobe have been built one after another, Nagasaki is not as good as it used to be. The city is desolate and the road administration is in disrepair. Its phenomenon is similar to that of Wusong, except that there are more trams and cars.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat was anchored, Japanese newspaper reporters arrived in droves. We only designated one person to speak so as to prevent inconsistencies in the publication. Soon, Mayor Kusama Hideo sent Fukuoka Dozo, the head of the school affairs section, and others to the port to greet us. We went ashore together. The reporter carried a camera, but because he did not have the right to freely photograph on the shore, the hero had no use for his martial arts. Only 20 cigarettes were allowed to be hidden on the body and were approved by the customs before being allowed to enter the country.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Exposition</h3>
<p>The International Industrial and Tourist Exposition. The first venue is located on Nakanojima Reclamation Ground in Nagasaki City, and the second venue is in Unzen National Park. The exhibition period is from March 25 to May 23, a total of 60 days. It is organized by the city's business community and assisted by the government. Its purpose is nothing more than to display domestic and foreign products and attract foreign tourists. Tickets cost 3 angles for adults and half price for children and soldiers. Groups receive separate discounts depending on the number of people. Children in groups of 30 or more pay only 5 points per person. We were invited by the city government and entered the venue for free.</p>
<p>We only visited the first venue due to the limited time. The venue is equipped with (1) Civilization Xiangguan, (2) Foreign Pavilion, (3) Tourism Pavilion, (4) Maritime Products Pavilion, (5) Machinery Pavilion, (6) Social Welfare Pavilion, (7) Taiwan Pavilion, (8) Hokkaido Pavilion, (9) Nikko Pavilion, (10) Ama Pavilion, (11) Industrial Main Hall, (12) Industrial Trade Hall, (13) National Defense Hall, (14) Invention Hall, (15) Education Hall, (16) Nagasaki Hall, (17) Korean Pavilion, (18) Manchuria Pavilion, (19) Performing Arts Hall, (20) Guest House, (21) Other Special Pavilions. In addition, there are reception offices, children's playgrounds, etc. The pavilions are all temporary buildings, with a budget of 500,000 gold. On the whole, it is inferior to our country's West Lake Exposition in the past. This is not surprising, because it is only the manpower and financial resources of one city.</p>
<p>Visiting each pavilion, I had a thousand feelings. The Manchuria Pavilion was the most heartbreaking. We could not bear to enter. We only saw a woman standing by the door, wearing a cheongsam and holding printed materials to greet tourists. The Japanese flag and the pseudo-national flag fluttered in the wind, which increased the sorrow of those who saw it.</p>
<p>The National Defense Hall has various modern weapons of war, historical sites of the Shanghai Incident, essentials of the Japanese army's combat process and traffic conditions in the Manchurian Incident, the application and prevention of poison gas, cold-proof clothing, and the miserable conditions of people's homes and fields affected by the war, and a part of urban air defense, which is displayed with electricity, which is quite eye-catching. First, the enemy's flying attack Gong is shown, followed by a sound alarm, then the enemy troops invade, and finally the enemy planes retreat, which is vivid and alarming. There is also a comparison of world military equipment and soldiers. The size of the American ship is large, and the Japanese ship looks inferior by comparison. China has 2 million soldiers, which is the world's largest, but they are weak and incompetent, indicating that they are easy to deceive. This kind of mentality is deeply rooted in the Japanese people, which is no different from injecting countless morphine needles. People of the country, are you still dreaming? The Tourism Pavilion mostly boasts about Japan's famous scenic spots and has a large chart of "Consumption of Japanese and Foreigners in Japan in Showa 7." According to statistics, foreign tourists spent a total of 43,113,000 gold in Japan, including 10 million gold on local products, 3 million gold on goods, 10 million gold on entertainment, 1 million gold on automobiles, 5.1 million gold on accommodation, 1.3 million gold on railway transportation, 1 million gold on city cars, 10 million gold on restaurants, and 1.783 million gold on miscellaneous expenses. Another table shows that 7,793 people from our country, 4,310 from the United States, 3,525 from the United Kingdom, 478 from France, 1,066 from Russia, 721 from Germany, and 3,068 from other countries visited Japan last year. Among them, the most people are from our country, and the most consumption is also in their country. However, in recent years, the number of Chinese people who have traveled to Japan has decreased by one-third compared with Showa 2. Japan currently has an international tourism bureau dedicated to attracting foreign guests and absorbing cash. Western countries also have similar organizations. Our country has a large land and many scenic spots. Why not stand up and think of something to organize?</p>
<p>That day, Japanese schools had spring break. Primary schools were on vacation from April 1 to 5, and secondary schools were on vacation from April 1 to 3, so there was no opportunity to visit any schools. Fortunately, the time spent on land was short. At 5 pm, the boat drove straight to Kobe.</p>
<h3>The Department of Education Approves Measures to Clear the Arrears of Education Funds in Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The arrears of education funds in Jiangyin have reached more than ten months, which is almost bankrupt. After the Department of Education commissioned Provincial Supervisor Feng Ce, etc. to come to Cheng for special inspection and reported to the Department of Education, it was determined to rectify, cut schools, merge classes, and order the bureau to implement it, and concentrate the education funds of various townships and strive to tighten them in order to ensure that education funds can be paid on a monthly basis in the future without any more arrears. The provincial supervisor also formulated a method for clearing the arrears of more than ten months of funds and submitted it to the Department of Education for approval to be handled by the county. The clearing method is as follows: (1) The five-point temporary mu donation that has not been collected, the land tax collection before the 18th year that has not been collected, the land tax collection education funds before the 22nd year that have been requested to be diverted, the slaughter surtax before the 22nd year that has not been collected, and the land rent before the 22nd year that has not been collected; (2) The receipts and expenditures for clearing the arrears should be registered in separate accounts, and the collected funds should be stored in special books for audit to avoid diversion; (3) The Education Bureau should use 60% of the funds collected in each period to first allocate the arrears to the teachers and staff who have left their jobs and are unemployed, and the remaining 40% to allocate the arrears to the teachers and staff of other educational institutions. However, after paying off the arrears of the unemployed teachers and staff and the arrears of the transferred teachers and staff, all the remaining funds must be combined to clear the arrears issued by the current teachers and staff or the Education Bureau. The original school, museum, and venue directors shall collect them, distribute them separately in accordance with the foregoing method, obtain receipts, and submit them to the Education Bureau for verification and publication; (4) Social education institutions and schools above the fourth grade must first prepare annual final accounts and submit them to the Education Bureau for review. If it is considered that there is a real deficit and should be cleared, they may be issued separately in accordance with the foregoing standards; (5) If teachers and staff are paid in name only and there is evidence of this, all arrears will not be paid; (6) All old arrears will be paid once at the end of January and July each year, and no excuses will be allowed to entangle them at ordinary times; (7) The accounts for clearing arrears shall be submitted to the County Education Funds Audit Committee for audit and publication on a monthly basis.</p>
<h3>The Members of the China Arts and Crafts Society Give Receptions in Peiping</h3>

<h3>Current Status of Education</h3>
<p>Mr. Lei first stated that the province currently has a total of 1,2691 high schools and elementary schools (including provincial, county, city, private, district, and township schools), with 567,206 male and female students, 27,296 teachers and staff, and other social education institutions. The total annual expenditure on education is 15,778,549 yuan, accounting for 30% of the province's total revenue. The ratio of educated to uneducated individuals is more than 50% educated. On average, in the province, 1.9 out of every 1,000 young people receive secondary education, and 50.7 children receive primary education. Each person in the province bears an average of 2.4 fen for higher education expenses, 1 jiao 9.9 fen for secondary education expenses, 4 jiao 0.7 fen for primary education expenses, and 3.8 fen for social education expenses, totaling 6 jiao 6.8 fen.</p>
<h3>Basic Infrastructure</h3>
<p>According to him, Guangxi's education policy is implemented in accordance with the province's administrative guidelines. Progress has been slow in the past due to neglect of the foundation. Therefore, the Provincial Government Committee meeting in September last year passed the "Outline of the Five-Year Plan for Popularizing National Basic Education in Guangxi," resolving to use political, economic, and social forces as the main and auxiliary means to popularize national basic education throughout the province within five years. The strength of national basic education will then be used to promote the political, economic, cultural, and social construction of the province. Based on the above resolution, three education bills were established: (1) the Five-Year Plan for Popularizing National Basic Education in Guangxi; (2) the Plan for Establishing the Guangxi National Basic Education Research Institute; and (3) the Regulations for the Pilot Zones for Popularizing National Basic Education in Guangxi. According to the provisions of the above bills, efforts will be made to promote their success. The content is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Methods: (1) Implement integration of labor and education; (2) Enable self-sufficiency in production to assist the province and the central government in dividing and cooperating.</p>
<p>Work is divided into two types: compulsory education and mass education. Compulsory education means that everyone from the age of six to twelve must be forced to receive two years of basic compulsory education. Out-of-school children from the age of twelve to sixteen must be forced to receive one year of compulsory education. Mass education aims to improve civil organizations, promote local autonomy, and promote cooperative movements.</p>
<p>Procedures: (1) Academic research: Establish the Guangxi National Basic Education Research Institute; (2) Pilot project: Select one county in each of the six districts of the province as a pilot zone for popularizing national basic education; (3) Promotion: All other counties except the pilot zones are divided into three phases for the promotion of national basic education, with one-third promoted in each phase.</p>
<p>Completion: (1) Starting from the establishment of the Guangxi National Basic Education Research Institute in November of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]; (2) Preparing the pilot zones from February to July of the 23rd year [i.e., 1934], starting operation in August of the same year, and completing it in July of the 25th year [i.e., 1936]; (3) Preparing the promotion zones from February of the 24th year [i.e., 1935] and completing the first phase in July of the 26th year [i.e., 1937]; (4) Completing the second phase of promotion from February of the 24th year [i.e., 1935] to July of the 27th year [i.e., 1938]; (5) Completing the third phase of promotion from February of the 26th year [i.e., 1937] to July of the 28th year [i.e., 1939].</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Lei said that the lack of popular education is the biggest shortcoming of our people. All social chaos and disturbances are caused by this. Such a five-year plan, unaffected by the political situation, has the possibility of being completed. Guangxi is an extremely poor region, and construction is inevitably simple and crude. Recently, public opinion generally says how good and how advanced Guangxi is, but in reality, it cannot yet be said to be good. However, the staff can all work hard and strive for progress, and their spirit is commendable. Because I have to go to the north to visit water conservancy projects and rural credit cooperatives, my return to Guangxi will be at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology Visiting Group Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The graduating students of the Tianjin Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology organized a visiting group, including seven students from the Department of Chemical Manufacturing, twenty-four students from the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, four students from the Leather Making Department of the Advanced Vocational Department, seven students from the Dyeing and Weaving Department, and seven students from the Mechanical Engineering Department. Led by five professors, they went to Jinan, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to visit production institutions and schools. They started their journey at the end of last month, stayed in Jinan for two days, and visited seven places including Shandong University and the Jinan Arsenal. They arrived in Beijing on the evening of the 3rd and stayed at the Engineering College of Central University. After the entire group paid homage to the mausoleum on the 4th, they began their two-day visit, totaling seven places including the Capital Power Plant and the Yangtze River Ferry. They arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 6th and stayed at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. On the 7th, they visited the Jiangnan Paper Mill, the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory, and the Huasheng Electric Factory. On the 8th, it was a Sunday and inconvenient for visits, so they took the opportunity to go to Hangzhou to visit scenic spots and visit one or two famous factories along the way. They returned to Shanghai on the 10th to continue their visits and returned to Tianjin about a week later.</p>
<h3>Tai Chi Exercise Training Organized by the Primary School Principals' Association Begins Registration</h3>
<p>The Tai Chi exercise training center organized by the Shanghai Primary School Principals' Association has been actively preparing since the inventor, Chu Minyi, generously agreed to serve as the instructor. Now that the spring break is over, everything is generally ready. All the regulations and notices will also be printed and distributed to the schools soon. However, the first phase of training is temporarily limited to current primary school teachers in the city due to time and location constraints, with a quota of 200 people. The training will take place every Sunday afternoon from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which does not conflict with school classes. The course can be completed in three weeks and is free of charge. The training location is planned to be at the Shuji Primary School in Tianhou Palace. Registration locations are at the Hub North Attached Primary School on Qiujiang Road and the Minfu School at the intersection of Huaji Road.</p>
<h3>Niu Changlian Appointed as Supervisor of the County Education Bureau</h3>
<p>The vacancy left by Zhu Changlin, the supervisor of the Shanghai County Education Bureau, after being promoted to director, has been approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, and Niu Changlian has been appointed as the successor. After being appointed, Mr. Niu has already arrived at the bureau to take up his duties.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Standardization of Land Rent in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Chen Honggen</p>
<p>Land rent is a kind of remuneration paid by tenant farmers to landlords for the use of land (such as what Ricardo called the original and indestructible properties of the soil), and its amount varies according to the fertility of the land. If we want to measure whether land rent is reasonable, in other words, whether the landlord's income is legitimate, the common practice is to use 10% of the land price as a standard to compare with the actual rent. At present, our country still has no legal rent rate, which is partly due to the unequal fertility of land in various places. However, the landlord's coercion or arbitrary determination of the rent often occurs, and at the same time, the tenant's concealment of the landlord to reduce the rent rate also often happens. If the land rent is too high, the tenant farmer will have little left after paying the rent, or even freeze and starve. Conversely, if the land rent is too low, the landlord will inevitably suffer a loss on his investment. Therefore, there should be a fair standard rate so that the interests of both parties can reach a state of equilibrium.</p>
<p>(1) Types of Rent Payment Systems</p>
<p>(A) Rent Payment in Cash - This means that the tenant farmer pays a certain amount of cash (per mu) to the landlord every year. This system is mostly practiced in areas with relatively fertile soil, even rainfall, abundant production, and prosperous industry and commerce, such as Jiangsu, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and other provinces.</p>
<p>(B) Rent Payment in Grain - Under this system, the tenant farmer pays a fixed amount of grain to the landlord. The lease contains a clear provision such as: "Pay ○ dou ○ sheng of dry and clean good rice in spring and autumn every year." This system is mostly adopted in rice-producing areas in northern and central China. The type of grain paid depends on the produce of the land, such as rent in rice in various counties in eastern Zhejiang and rent in milled rice in various counties in western Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(C) Sharecropping - A. Ordinary Sharecropping - The tenant and landlord agree on a certain percentage of the harvest to be shared, and then divide the annual harvest according to this ratio. The agreed-upon percentage varies from place to place due to differences in land fertility and the amount of supplies provided by the landlord. For example, in Guangshan in Henan, Jingjiang and Nantong in Jiangsu, Guangdong, Hunan, and other places, the tenant gets 60% and the landlord gets 40%; in Jiangning, Haimen, Liuhe, Huaian, Yancheng in Jiangsu, Hunan, Guangdong, and other places, the tenant and landlord each get half; in other places, the landlord gets 70% and the tenant gets 30%, such as in Jingjiang and Rugao; there are also cases where the landlord gets 30% and the tenant gets 70%, such as in Jurong. The situations are mixed and inconsistent. B. _ _ Sharecropping - When the crops are ripe each year, the tenant asks the landlord to go to the countryside to inspect, and both parties temporarily negotiate the sharing ratio, such as in Guangshan in Henan and Jingjiang County in Jiangsu. C. Help-with-Work Tenant Farming - This is also a type of sharecropping, but because it is mostly practiced in areas with poor land fertility, such as Wutai County in Shanxi, the tenant only provides labor. Other things such as seeds, fertilizers, houses, and waterwheels are all supplied by the landlord. Therefore, the percentage of the harvest that the tenant receives is very low.</p>
<p>(2) Comparison of Current Land Rent with Standard Rent Rates</p>
<p>(A) Statistics from the Legislative Yuan in 1930 show the cash rent rates for dry land and paddy fields in various provinces as follows:</p>
<p>Province Name | Upper Field | Middle Field | Lower Field</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>| Paddy Field | Dry Field | Paddy Field | Dry Field | Paddy Field | Dry Field</p>
<p>Jilin | 2.8 | 15.0 | 0.8 | 18.8 | 1.9 | 20.5</p>
<p>Liaoning | 20.3 | 7.0 | 16.1 | 7.0 | 15.8 | 5.3</p>
<p>Chahar | 9.3 | 10.0 | 9.3 | 11.4 | 13.5 | 15.3</p>
<p>Shanxi | 12.9 | 12.0 | 14.8 | 15.7 | 16.0 | 18.5</p>
<p>Hebei | 9.4 | 11.0 | 12.2 | 11.0 | 11.2 | 15.2</p>

<p>Anhui | ... | 8.7 | ... | 12.5 | | 13.0</p>
<p>Henan | 9.6 | 9.5 | 9.8 | 10.0 | 12.0 | 12.4</p>
<p>Hubei | 11.3 | - | 13.8 | - | 19.4 | -</p>
<p>Sichuan | 16.8 | 7.6 | 14.8 | 7.8 | 14.6 | 6.5</p>
<p>Hunan | 12.0 | - | 12.5 | - | 13.5 | -</p>
<p>Jiangxi | 15.5 | 12.2 | 18.7 | 15.3 | 18.3 | 10.9</p>
<p>Zhejiang | 14.0 | - | 15.0 | - | 16.0 | -</p>
<p>Average | 11.2 | 10.0 | 12.5 | 12.5 | 13.5 | 14.0</p>
<p>Dry Land - The average rent rate for upper-grade land is 10%, with the difference ranging from 7% in Liaoning Province to 15% in Jilin Province. Liaoning Province also has the lowest rate for middle-grade land. The average rate for each province is 12.5%. Sichuan (6.5%) and Jiangsu (9.3%) have the lowest rates for lower-grade land, with an average of 14.0%. Paddy Field - The difference in paddy fields is larger. For example, in Jilin, the rate for upper-grade land is 20.3%, while in Jiangsu it is 6.3%, a difference of more than threefold. Jiangxi has the highest rate for middle-grade land (18.7%), followed by Liaoning, Shanxi, and Sichuan. The average for lower-grade land is 13.5%, with the difference ranging from 19.4% in Hubei to 7.0% in Jiangsu.</p>
<p>(B) Survey by the Department of Agricultural Economics, Jinling University - According to the survey conducted by the Department of Agricultural Economics, Jinling University on the rent rates of 501 farm households in nine locations in five provinces, the results are as follows:</p>
<p>| Province  | County   | Amount by which Rent per Mu should be Increased or Decreased compared to Standard Rent  | Rent per Mu | Percentage by which Rent per Mu should be Increased or Decreased compared to Standard Rent |</p>
<p>|---------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|</p>

<p>| **Northern China** |        |                                                                       |          |                                                                    |</p>
<p>| Anhui     | Su County  | 1.73 + 0.03                                                               | 1.76   | + 1.1                                                              |</p>
<p>| Shanxi    | Wutai    | 2.87 - 0.81                                                               | 2.06   | - 28.2                                                             |</p>
<p>| **Central-Eastern China**|          |                                                                       |          |                                                                    |</p>
<p>| Anhui     | Lai'an (1921) | 1.92 + 1.46                                                               | 3.57   | - 26.5                                                             |</p>
<p>| Lai'an (1922) | 2.26 - 0.62                                                               | 1.64   | - 27.4                                                             |</p>
<p>| Zhejiang  | Zhenhai  | 4.64 - 1.20                                                               | 3.44   | - 25.9                                                             |</p>
<p>| Fujian    | Lianjiang | 12.50 - 3.07                                                              | 9.43   | - 24.6                                                             |</p>
<p>| Jiangsu   | Jiangning | 3.94 + 1.57                                                               | 5.51   | + 39.8                                                              |</p>
<p>| Jiangning (S) | 2.03 - 0.76                                                               | 1.27   | - 37.4                                                             |</p>
<p>| Wujin (T) | 4.94 - 1.07                                                               | 3.87   | - 21.7                                                             |</p>
<p>| **Average**|          | 4.43 - 0.98                                                               | 3.45   | - 22.1                                                             |</p>
<p>(Note) The "-" sign in the table indicates the amount that should be deducted because it is greater than the standard rent amount, and the absence of the "-" sign indicates the amount that should be increased because it is less than the standard rent amount.</p>
<p>The rent amounts in the table are expressed in cash. Lianjiang County has the highest rent, requiring 12.5 yuan per mu, while Su County only requires 1.7 yuan per mu. On average, each location requires 4.43 yuan per mu. If this is compared with 10% of the land price, then all locations except Chunhua Town in Jiangning County and Su County exceed the standard, such as Lianjiang exceeding 3.07 yuan per mu, and Lai'an exceeding 1.29 yuan. The average amount exceeded is 0.98 yuan in each location. According to the standard fair rent amount, the original rent amount should be reduced by an average of 22.1% in each location, that is, only 3.45 yuan should be paid per mu. As for the actual amount and percentage that should be increased or decreased in each location, please see the table for details.</p>
<p>(C) The Agricultural Survey Record of Jiangsu Province also has statistics on rent rates.</p>
<p>Now I will list it below.</p>
<p>| Land Grade | Land Price | Rent Amount | Rent Rate |</p>
<p>|---------|----------|----------|----------|</p>
<p>| Lower Grade (High Land) | 37.03 yuan | 2.99 yuan | 8.1%    |</p>
<p>| Upper Grade (Medium Normal Land) | 50.93 yuan | 3.82 yuan | 7.5%    |</p>
<p>| Middle Grade (Low Land) | 34.51 yuan | 3.02 yuan | 8.8%    |</p>
<p>This can also prove that most of the cash rents in Jiangsu Province do not exceed the standard, which is roughly in line with the statistical results of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>(D) Qiao Qiming conducted a survey on the rent rates of tenant farmers in Kunshan, Nantong, and Su County, and the results are as follows: (See Chapter 5, Page 32 of "Comparison of Farmland Systems and Suggestions for Improving Farmer-Tenant Problems")</p>
<p>| Location | Kunshan | Nantong | Su County |</p>
<p>|---------|----------|----------|----------|</p>
<p>| Type | Land Grade | Upper | Middle | Lower | Upper | Middle | Lower | Upper | Middle | Lower |</p>
<p>| Cash Rent System | 4.2 | 4.8 | 4.6 | 6.6 | 7.0 | 7.8 |  |  |  |</p>
<p>| Rent in Grain System | 10.6% | 12.6% | 13.4% | 12.0% | 11.5% | 9.5% | 7.5% | 11.2% | 11.5% |</p>
<p>| Crop Share System | 10.3 | 11.3 | 10.0 | 9.0 | 12.5 | 15.0 |  |  |  |</p>
<p>Under the cash rent system, all three locations are smaller than the standard rent rate, especially Nantong, which is less than half of the standard rent rate. Under the rent in grain system, except for the lower-grade land in Nantong and the upper-grade land in Su County, the rest all exceed 1% of the land price. As for the rent rates of the crop share system, the differences are even greater, with the lower-grade land in Su County being as high as 15%.</p>
<p>(E) Zhejiang Province - According to the statistics of the Legislative Yuan (see Statistical Monthly Report, Volume 2, Issue 6, pages 30-32), the cash rent rates for upper, middle, and lower grades of paddy fields in 21 counties and 21 villages in Zhejiang Province are 9.3%, 9.2%, and 11.5%. According to the survey of 85 villages in 20 counties in western Zhejiang, the rent rates in several villages are as follows: -</p>
<p>|           | Upper Field | Middle Field | Lower Field |</p>
<p>|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|</p>

<p>| **Average** |  | 112.27 | 9.6  | 67.50  | 11.1 | 41.50 | 14.1 |</p>
<p>In the first table, the average cash rent rate for each village is 8.8% for upper-grade land, 9.1% for middle-grade land, and 11.9% for lower-grade land. These are very close to the standard rent rate overall.</p>
<p>The second table converts each mu of grain rent into its current value and then compares it with the standard rent rate. The rent rate for upper-grade land is 9.6%, for middle-grade land it is 11.1%, and for lower-grade land it is 14.1%. The difference from the standard rate is much larger than that of cash rent.</p>
<p>(3) Relationship between Various Rent Systems and Standard Rates</p>
<p>(A) Cash Rent System - Under the cash rent system, rent rates in most places are around 10%. Even if there are differences, they are very small. For example, in Kunshan and Su County, whether it is upper, middle, or lower grade, the rate does not exceed the percentage of the land price. The same is true for upper and middle-grade paddy fields in Zhejiang Province. The statistics of the Legislative Yuan show that the differences in several provinces are larger, but still not as much as other rent systems.</p>
<p>(B) Grain Rent System - The rent rate under this system often exceeds the standard, such as upper, middle, and lower grades in Kunshan, and upper and middle grades in Nantong, and lower grades in Su County, all of which are more than 1% of the land price. Furthermore, in eight villages in western Zhejiang, except for a portion of the upper-grade middle, the rest all exceed the standard rate, with the higher ones reaching over 20% (such as Zaoxi Town in Yuqian County and Shan Village in Fengxiao County).</p>
<p>(C) Sharecropping System - According to Qiao Qiming's statistics, the difference between the rent rate of the sharecropping system and the standard rate is greater than the other two, such as the lower grade in Su County being 15% and the middle grade being 12.5%. Only the upper grade does not reach 10%.</p>
<p>(4) Relationship between Land Grade and Rent Rate</p>
<p>From the tables above, it is not difficult to discover an important relationship, that is, the lower the land grade, the higher the rent rate is compared to the higher-grade land. This is indeed a successful inverse proportion.</p>
<p>(A) Cash Rent System - According to the statistics of the Legislative Yuan, the rent rate for dry land in Jilin Province is 15.0% for upper-grade land, 18.8% for middle-grade land, and 20.5% for lower-grade land. The statistics from other provinces also show the same trend.</p>
<p>(B) Grain Rent System - Shows the same situation as the cash rent system. For example, the rent rate for upper-grade land in Yunlao Village, Changhua County, is less than half of that for lower-grade land. Only a few places are exceptions, such as the rent rate for land in Nantong, which decreases along with its grade.</p>
<p>(C) Sharecropping System - The relationship between the rent rate and land grade under the sharecropping system is quite uncertain. For example, the rent rate for lower-grade land in Nantong is smaller than that for upper-grade land, while the opposite is true in Su County. The Legislative Yuan also has statistics on the changes in the rent rate of the sharecropping system, and the results are slightly similar to Nantong, which will not be discussed here.</p>
<p>The reason why the rent rate is higher for poorer land is nothing more than the fact that secondary land is mostly rented by tenant farmers. As the population gradually increases, there will inevitably be more competitors, and the land rent will increase accordingly. At the same time, landlords often unfairly estimate the value of secondary land, which is also enough to cause the rent rate to rise.</p>
<p>(5) Impact and Relief of Land Rent Exceeding the Standard</p>
<p>Through the above analysis, we can see that the land rent in our country mostly exceeds the standard. The biggest impacts are: (A) Reduction of the living standard of tenant farmers; Tenant farmers are in such a state that their income is extremely low. The annual consumption of each adult male is only about fifty yuan, and even the simplest problems of clothing and food are difficult to solve. As Dong Zhongshu said, "There is the dignity of a monarch in a town, and the wealth of a duke in a village. Some till the fields of wealthy people and see a tax of fifteen, so the poor often wear the clothes of cattle and horses and eat the food of dogs and pigs." (B) Depriving tenant farmers of the opportunity to improve; Tenant farmers are only one stage in the agricultural ladder (Agriculture Ladder). Young farmers consider it appropriate to rent other people's land because they lack capital and experience. Later, he always hopes to save some surplus money to buy a piece of land and become a self-cultivating farmer. However, in the current situation where farmers have difficulty maintaining their livelihoods, talking about improvement is really too vague. (C) The extreme disparity between the rich and poor classes in society; Since a portion of the tenant farmer's benefits is seized by the landlord, the poor will become poorer and the rich will become richer. There are often those who take risks and become bandits.</p>
<p>The remedy, of course, is to reduce land rent, but it is very difficult to implement. First, a detailed survey of land prices must be conducted as the basis for determining the standard rent amount. Second, the situation in various places is too complicated and must be referred to in detail and stipulated separately. Third, landlords in various places will rise up in opposition in order to protect their interests. Therefore, I think that such a difficult task can only be realized by our fair authorities using political power. - On the 26th, in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Land Relations in Four Villages of Suide County</h3>
<p>— Gou Shisheng</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Suide County is located in the northern part of Shaanxi Province, a mountainous area. The Wuding River and Dali River flow through it, but they cannot be used for irrigation and often cause floods. Farmers cultivate land on the mountain slopes, which is called mountain land. The mountain land is steep, sometimes up to 45 degrees, making it difficult to cultivate and unable to retain water. When there is a drought, there is no solution. The flat land between the mountains is better than the mountain land and is called river land. The harvest is greater, but the area of river land is very small compared to the area of mountain land. If there is well water available for irrigation on the river land, it becomes irrigated land, and almost all irrigated land is used to plant opium poppies.</p>
<p>Unlike the central part of Shaanxi, land ownership here is concentrated, and most farmers have no land or very little land. A small portion of the land is concentrated in the hands of landlords in this county, and a large portion is concentrated in the hands of landlords in neighboring counties, especially the Ma family in Yangjiagou Village, Mizhi County. There is a significant separation between land ownership and land use. The poor farmers and local small and medium landlords in the villages are also somewhat opposed to each other, but their experiences are equally unfortunate... Land ownership is only decreasing and not increasing.</p>
<p>Although the famines of the past few years have not had as severe an impact on the farmers of Suide as the man-eating conditions in Fengxiang and Wugong, they have not been spared heavy taxes and levies. Proportionally, the poorer the farmers, the heavier the burden. Landlords use their power to pay less tax, or even no tax at all. The poor farmers become even poorer.</p>
<p>Now, we will discuss four villages in Suide: Yimagou, Leijiagou, Liuguochuan, and Emaoyu. These are four moderate-sized villages that can represent the general situation.</p>
<p>The unit of measurement for mountain land and river land is "shang," which is approximately equal to three mu. The unit for irrigated land is "mu." For the convenience of discussion, we will convert river land and irrigated land into mountain land based on their yield and area. The yield per shang of mountain land is approximately equal to the yield per mu of ordinary dry land.</p>
<p>II. Decrease in Land Ownership</p>
<p>Before the famine in 1928, the land ownership in the four villages was 2079.0 shang. In 1933, it decreased to 1616.4 shang, a decrease of 462.6 shang, accounting for 22.25% of the 1928 total. Whether it was landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, or poor peasants in 1928, land ownership decreased, and the decrease was faster for poor peasants. As a result, by 1933, the number of landlords decreased from five households to four households, the number of rich peasants remained at nine households, the number of middle peasants decreased from forty-one households to thirty-one households, the number of poor peasants increased from one hundred and ninety-seven households to two hundred and seventeen households, and the number of households not engaged in farming decreased from thirteen to eleven. In 1928, there were a total of two hundred and sixty-five households, and in 1933, there were a total of two hundred and seventy-two households, an increase of seven households, which was due to family divisions.</p>
<p>Of the one hundred and ninety-seven poor peasant households in 1928, eighty-nine were tenant farmers, sixty-one were hired laborers, and forty-seven were owner-cultivators. Of the two hundred and seventeen poor peasant households in 1933, one hundred and twenty-two were tenant farmers, forty-seven were hired laborers, and forty-eight were owner-cultivators. The increase in tenant farmers was so rapid.</p>
<p>The decrease in land ownership followed a three-step process. First, due to insufficient harvest or to cope with taxes, loans were taken out from landlords. Loans invariably used land as collateral, with very few exceptions. Landlord creditors, especially the Sanyuantang of the Ma family in Yangjiagou, Mizhi, not only owned vast amounts of land but also operated shops in towns, such as Shuanghuyuzhen. Loan negotiations often took place in these shops. Second, if the loan was not repaid by the due date, the mortgaged land became pawned land, with the pawn price used to pay off the principal and interest of the loan. Third, if the pawned land was not redeemed by the due date, it was sold to the landlord, with the sale price used to pay off the pawn price, perhaps with a slight surplus. (For more on loans, please see my article "Loans in Emaoyu Village, Suide County, Shaanxi" in New China, Volume 2, Issue 5, page 75).</p>
<p>Of the 462.6 shang of land that decreased over the past five years, most was pawned out, and a small portion was sold. 17.3 shang were bought in, 47.0 shang were pawned in, 94.5 shang were sold out, and 432.4 shang were pawned out. The ratio of pawned and sold shang to total shang was highest for the poor peasants in 1928, at 30.07%, followed by the middle peasants.</p>
<p>Rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants all had land pawned out. The ratio of pawned shang to total shang was 28.61% in 1928 and 17.48% in 1933. Thus, the situation seems better overall, but for the poor peasants who make up the largest proportion, the situation was worse. It was 30.19% in 1928 and 58.21% in 1933. More than half of the land of the poor peasants was pawned out.</p>
<p>III. Distribution and Use of Land</p>
<p>In terms of households, landlords owned 68.35 shang per household, rich peasants 41.06 shang, middle peasants 14.81 shang, and poor peasants 2.37 shang. The average number of shang owned by poor peasants per household is less than one twenty-eighth of that of landlords. One hundred and twenty-four of the poor peasant households had no land, accounting for 57.14% of the total of two hundred and seventeen poor peasant households. 77.42% of the poor peasants had land below four shang. How can four shang of land sustain a family!</p>
<p>Moreover, it is less than four shang!</p>
<p>Because consumers are calculated individually, and because the average number of people per household differs between landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants, we need to look at the average number of shang owned per person in each category of village household separately.</p>
<p>The average number of people per landlord household is 7.00; for rich peasants, it is 7.67; for middle peasants, it is 6.45; and for poor peasants, it is 5.63. The average number of shang owned per person by landlords is 9.76; for rich peasants, it is 5.36; for middle peasants, it is 2.30; and for poor peasants, it is 0.42. The number of shang owned per person by poor peasants is less than one twenty-third of that of landlords. The average number of shang owned per person by middle peasants is 2.30, which means that to maintain a minimum standard of living, each person must have at least 2.30 shang of land. The average number of shang owned per person by poor peasants is 0.42, less than one-fifth of the minimum. If all the land were evenly distributed to everyone, including those who are not currently engaged in farming, each person would receive 1.04 shang of land, which is still less than half of the minimum. Land ownership is concentrated in the hands of local landlords, and land ownership has fallen into the hands of outsiders! This has deepened the poverty of the majority of farmers. The absolute mean deviation of the average land ownership per person for each category of village household (Mean Deviation) is 3.10 shang, and the relative mean deviation is 110.18%. The absolute mean deviation in Fengxiang County is only 1.46 mu, and the relative mean deviation is 61.21%.</p>
<p>Average Land Ownership per Person in Four Villages of Suide (1933)</p>
<p>Village Household Average Land Ownership per Person Deviation</p>
<p>Landlord 9.76 5.30</p>
<p>Rich Peasant 5.36 0.90</p>
<p>Middle Peasant 3.30 2.16</p>
<p>Poor Peasant 0.42 4.04</p>
<p>Absolute Average 4.46 3.10</p>
<p>Relative Average 110.18%</p>
<p>Unit: shang %</p>
<p>The land used is almost twice as much as the land owned. The former is 187.42% of the latter. Separately, the land used by middle peasants and poor peasants is more than what they own; this is not the case for landlords and rich peasants. 55.01% of the landlords' land is rented out; 11.37% of the rich peasants' land is rented out, but 1.21% of the land used is rented in; 21.31% of the land used by middle peasants is rented in; 2.14% of the poor peasants' land is rented out, but 74.72% of the land used is rented in.</p>
<p>The poor peasants are in such great need of land.</p>

<h3>Securities: New York Stock Market Mixed</h3>
<p>According to a Wall Street Journal report by Xinfeng Foreign Firm, yesterday's stock market was sluggish and mixed, with no discernible trend. Traders were holding a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting developments in Washington. Mining stocks rose slightly due to silver advocates promoting silver legislation. Specialty stocks were also firm. Railroad stocks were flat due to good railway freight traffic. American Telephone and Telegraph fell by a little over one yuan because Congress was about to investigate whether its corporate structure violated antitrust laws. The small exchange market saw alternating ups and downs. Bonds were also mixed, with corporate bonds rising slightly and U.S. government bonds falling slightly. According to a report from our firm's agent, (securities) experienced minor fluctuations, but the foundation was firm, awaiting news. (Wheat) market conditions were sluggish, awaiting important news from Washington. (Cotton) transactions were difficult to develop before the Punkhai case and silver legislation were resolved. Spot and yarn were quiet. According to a special dispatch from the New York Standard Statistics Company, in the long run, the search for investment by idle funds is sufficient to push up stocks and bonds. Therefore, broadly speaking, current property can be preserved. However, investors must carefully review their respective assets, so as to eliminate securities of companies that will suffer from increased production costs in the future and replace them with those that have investment or speculative hope. Specialty stocks can also be purchased further. In terms of interest rates and commerce, the status of bonds remains good, and the Ministry of Finance's ability to swap maturing old debt for public debt at extremely low-interest rates demonstrates that the government's financial position has greatly consolidated. Higher and medium-grade bonds are still the best comparison. Half-day turnover was 550,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: American Cotton Ultimately Weak Due to Lack of Buyers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market lacked major buyers. Negative news from Liverpool and profit-taking by bulls led to a decline. As a result, spot prices fell by five points, and futures prices rose or fell by two to four points. Liverpool cotton spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices fell by one point. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by four points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by retail traders, Japanese traders, and speculators, but later fell back due to profit-taking by bulls. As a result, Pingar fell by one rupee and seven and a half annas, Aomura rose by seven and a half annas, and Bairaoshi rose by two and a half annas.

<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Market Declines Day by Day</h3>
<p>Hankou City Still Able to Maintain: Zhejiang Route Drops Sharply Repeatedly</p>
<p>The asphalt market has been declining day by day for two months. The situation in Hankou can still be maintained, but the Hangzhou area has experienced repeated drops. Since the spring market until now, it has already dropped by several yuan and jiao, as if it were a raging tide that cannot be reversed. This is really rare in recent years. Although the drop in Hankou is very slight, the current market price of heavy Jing per batu is still slightly above 16 yuan, Pingjing is 15 yuan and three or four jiao, Wumao Tianjin is 15 yuan and five or six jiao, and Macheng per dan is slightly above 15 yuan. The stock is not thick, and the source is not strong. Even if it is sold completely, it will not drop too much again. However, the Zhejiang route area is very depressed. It is now heard that the price of Neiping Shan sold to Shanghai is only 16 yuan and sixty-eight jiao. However, this kind of Neiping oil is not the original product, and it is suspected to be Lan oil repackaged. Therefore, the weight per jin is heavier than Neiping, and users do not notice this and are very welcome. There is also this car oil from Jiaxing area, which has now fallen to within 19 yuan. There are occasional sales in this port, but the number is not large, and it is said that the stock of inland car lines is already thin. Only the hoarders still have two or three thousand pieces. Because they all have to lose money, there are many who are eager to sell, and there are also many who hold on and do not sell. Originally, this car has an independent nature. Although it is also asphalt, the market often has different trends. Therefore, it is possible that it will not follow the price drop in the future. The stock of this port's dealers is very scarce. Affected by the sharp drop in Zhejiang oil, their interest in importing goods is extremely weak. Although spring sales are far inferior to previous years, the goods in stock are all high-priced. Therefore, they would rather have no transactions, and they are unwilling to sell at too low a price. The current selling price of heavy Jing is 20 yuan per batu, Pingjing is around 19 yuan, and Macheng oil market is slightly above 17 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Grain: Late Rice in Xitang Falls by Five Points</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, more than 40 sources (over 6,000 shi) arrived from various gangs, with thick and thin japonica rice each accounting for half. The destination of late rice, such as the guest gang's wholesalers, became slack again due to the week, and all the Nanyang gangs did not move. Only the Northern Ocean, Tianjin, Weihaiwei and other gangs continued to adopt, with a number of only about a thousand bags. The situation was quiet, and the market was soft. Fortunately, the sellers were unwilling to let go easily, and it did not fall. Only those in the middle slightly trimmed, such as Qingjiao Sijing and other goods stations fixed, and Xitang and other goods depreciated by five points. However, the guest family's willingness to accept was slack, and the future market may be a day of fatigue and decline. Houjing and Du Yangjian's store stomach are normal, and the general trend is similar to the previous one, so the price of goods such as Changbang Su Tong Nan Gang is still fixed. Except for Bian Yuan's destination, which is still acceptable, although the market has not seen glory or disgrace, the situation is still tight.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: The Silk Market was Dull Last Week</h3>
<p>Overseas Silk Inventory Abundant… Demand Slack</p>
<p>Japanese Silk Dumping at Low Prices… Bleak Future</p>
<p>Last week, the foreign firm silk market in this port was still dull and listless. The US inflation is still difficult to achieve, New York silk inventory is abundant, Japanese silk exports to the United States are increasingly prosperous, Japanese merchants are dumping at low prices, and the demand of various silk factories is not smooth, so the silk price is ultimately difficult to stand firm. Although there are factory screenings and transactions in London, the asking price is still small. The current silk market price has fallen and not risen. The silk base of each silk factory in Lyon is not weak, the economy is insufficient, and they all have the purpose of buying as they use. In addition, they focus on cheap Japanese silk, and the market price is getting lower and lower. The internal departments are sparsely interested in importing Huangbai factories due to the declining sales in spring and the fact that many summer silk raw materials use rayon. Although the silk merchants in Shanghai are due to the launch of Jiangzhe spring silkworms, the new cocoons will soon be on the market, and the old silk inventory is thick, they are willing to lower prices to seek sales. However, they lack a recipient. The silk sales prospect is still dim. Dozens of bales of silk were traded last week, and exports were less than 200 bales. The following is a list of the prices of Chinese silk in the European and American markets at the end of the week (New York price per pound, unit: gold yuan Lyon price per kilo, unit: franc)</p>
<p>Silk Type New York Lyon Silk Type New York Lyon</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Warp 1.56 74.75 Superior Dry Warp 1.42 65.00</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Warp 1.45 69.00 Medium Dry Warp 1.31 59.50</p>
<p>Medium Shanghai Warp 1. 66 64.50 Inferior Dry Warp 1.20 53.75</p>
<p>Inferior Shanghai Warp 1.24 58.50 Superior Big Warp 1.36 61.75</p>
<p>Superior Shandong Warp 1.40 66.25 Inferior Big Warp 1.25 53.25</p>
<p>Superior Sichuan Warp 1.42 66.50 Superior White Silk 0.73 29.75</p>
<p>Superior Gray Warp 0.80 37.75</p>
<h3>Japanese Rayon Imports Still Strong</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese rayon has been actively shipped to China for dumping. Last week, each Japanese ship also brought more than 900 boxes of Sakura and other brands of rayon from Kobe and other ports, which were stored in the Red Port Japan Mail Steamship Company warehouse, it is said.</p>

<h3>Further Elaboration on Injury from Cold (Part One, Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Wu Youke also said, "Generally, when someone falls ill, if the pathogenic influence is strong, the illness will be severe, and the fever will be high. If the pathogenic influence is mild, the illness will be light, and the fever will be slight. The severity of the fever depends on the severity of the pathogenic influence. In the second and third months, and the eighth and ninth months, there are also cases of severe illness with persistent high fever, leading to death due to improper treatment. In the fifth and sixth months, there are also cases of mild illness with slight fever that heal without medication. Generally, warm diseases exist in all four seasons, but they are more common in midsummer, followed by spring and autumn, and then winter. We can only differentiate the frequency of illness based on the season, not the severity of the fever." Here, Wu Youke is attacking the idea that summer diseases are extremely severe compared to warm diseases.</p>
<p>Wu Youke also said, "Spring is warm, summer is hot, autumn is cool, and winter is cold. These are the norms of the four seasons, slightly modified by wind, rain, cloudiness, and sunshine. For example, if spring should be warm but is instead often cold, there must be much rain. If autumn should be cool but the heat does not dissipate, there must be much sunshine. The unpredictability of cloudiness, sunshine, cold, and flooding, and the increase or decrease of cold and heat, cannot be constrained. These are the normal occurrences of heaven and earth and the four seasons and are not necessarily epidemics. An epidemic is caused by sensing the perverse Qi of heaven and earth. Perverse Qi is neither cold, nor hot, nor warm, nor cool, nor is it a mixture of the four seasons' Qi. Instead, heaven and earth have a separate type of perverse Qi, which is often seen in years of war and disaster. It may occur in some other years but is not as prevalent." Here, Wu Youke is attacking the theory that the presence of a certain Qi outside of its appropriate time is the cause of epidemic Qi.</p>
<p>Wu Youke also said, "The reason is that they do not know that perverse Qi causes epidemics. However, they do know that it is not the Qi of cold and heat that is sensed according to the season. They can only consider the Qi of the four seasons mixed together as the epidemic. But they do not know that the Qi of the four seasons, although it may increase or decrease, ultimately does not depart from its source when it comes to the illness sensed." Wu Youke's idea is that those who wrote on the theory of Yin and Yang, regarding the onset of epidemics, already knew that they could not be generated by the cold and heat of the appropriate season. Because they did not know of a separate perverse Qi, they could only attribute it to the mixed Qi of the four seasons, such as spring being very cold, summer being very cool, autumn being very hot, and winter being very warm, as the origin of the onset of epidemics. They did not know that even if there is mixed, abnormal Qi, it is only an increase or decrease of cold and heat. Even if it can cause illness, it is only an illness of the original Qi, and there is no reason for it to brew into an epidemic. Wu Youke directly recognized the original Qi of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness as the cause of illness. No matter how mixed or abnormal it becomes, no matter how much it increases or decreases, it is only an illness of the original Qi and cannot depart from its source. There is absolutely no reason for it to transform into an epidemic. This kind of thinking truly captures the spirit of science, similar to the Western assertion that microorganisms must be generated by microorganisms and cannot spontaneously arise. They achieve the same result through different means. His mind is clear, his thinking is thorough, his principles are firm, and his methods are decisive. He is truly a unique figure in the history of Chinese medicine. Only someone like him can resolve disputes, eliminate falsehoods, and clear away the fog to reveal the blue sky. It is a pity that there is no successor, so it has become a lost art. I lament that the medical community in our country is full of mediocre and foolish people, and those who come and go are all walking corpses. How sad!</p>
<p>In short, Wu Youke considered warm and hot diseases to be epidemics, opposed the theory that latent diseases develop immediately after being contracted, and also opposed the theory that the mixed Qi of the four seasons transforms into epidemics. He uniquely created the theory of a separate perverse Qi to break through the ancient scope of the six Qi as the cause of illness. Only someone with accurate insight, refined thinking, who is not bound by the past, and does not cater to the world, can directly express their views and be pragmatic. Who else can do this? It is a pity that the science of pathogenic bacteria had not yet been developed at that time, and there was no physical evidence to prove the theory of perverse Qi. Otherwise, his contribution would not be less than that of Guo Hong of Germany or Pasteur of France.</p>
<p>Wu Youke denied that the mixed Qi of the four seasons could brew warm epidemics, but he still believed that the original Qi of the four seasons could indeed cause illness. Therefore, he believed that injuries from cold are indeed caused by wind and cold. He considered them to be illnesses caused by the original Qi of the four seasons, not by the influence of perverse Qi, so he placed them outside the category of warm epidemics. In fact, the Qi of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness of the four seasons cannot be the origin of febrile diseases. What is now called catching a cold is still caused by pathogenic bacteria. Wind and cold are only the inducing factors, merely acting as the medium. Therefore, from the perspective of modern scientific medicine, injuries from cold, as described by Zhang Zhongjing, are also epidemics and infectious diseases. Looking at his preface, he said, "My clan used to be numerous, close to two hundred people. Since the Jian'an years, not even ten years have passed, and two-thirds of them have died. Injuries from cold account for seven out of ten deaths." Is this not a case of illnesses being similar among the young and old? How can it be said that it is not the Qi of the epidemic season? It is simply not within a single year. Therefore, I say that Zhang Zhongjing's "Treatise on Cold Damage" is also a treatise on infectious diseases. It is the same as Wu Youke's warm epidemics, caused by the influence of pathogenic bacteria. The differentiation made in the Yin Yang Grand Theory, the distinctions made in the Small Prescriptions, and the boundaries drawn by Wu Youke all fail to grasp the true nature. It is better to classify febrile diseases as a type of injury from cold, as Su Wen does, or to use injury from cold as the general name for the five diseases, as the Classic of Difficulties does, or to combine the common and refined into one, as the Elbow Reserve Emergency Formulas does, or to unify cold and warm for treatment, as Yao and Zhang do, to be able to grasp the key points and observe their convergence.</p>
<h3>Qualitative Analysis of Foreign Doctors in China</h3>
<p>— Guo Peiqing</p>
<p>Foreign doctors practicing in China are most numerous in the major cities. Only a small number are found in the inland areas, relying on missionary hospitals for their practice. Although their numbers in the country are not large, they do not feel any obstacles in their practice due to the national obsession with foreign things. On the contrary, they are often welcomed by the general public. This phenomenon is indeed caused by the national mentality of admiring foreigners, but in reality, it often causes material losses to the Chinese people. In some cases, they are wrongly harmed or unknowingly used as experimental subjects. This is truly a matter of utmost regret for us.</p>
<p>Foreign doctors began to enter China in the late Qing Dynasty, about fifty or sixty years ago. At that time, the maritime ban was largely lifted, and foreigners, based on treaties, penetrated deep into the Chinese interior to preach. However, very few could do so without hindrance and be welcomed. Therefore, in order to show love and benevolence, they often set up hospitals near churches to provide free medical care for the poor. Over time, they gradually gained the support and welcome of the people. However, their initial purpose was not medical care but rather to focus on preaching.</p>
<p>Foreign doctors came to China one after another with the purpose of preaching. Their initial steps were to show benevolence to win the support of the general population and achieve their goal of religious anesthesia. Then, taking advantage of the Chinese people's ignorance and gullibility, they did not act with caution when encountering difficult diseases. Instead, they often took risks and experimented, using the Chinese people as medical experimental subjects. (However, at that time, new medicine abroad was not as developed as it is today.) In the past ten years or so, the Chinese people have become increasingly fond of foreign doctors, so the number of those who cross the ocean to come to China has suddenly increased. Among these foreign doctors, there are indeed many with advanced knowledge and rich experience. However, there are also those who exploit the Chinese people's admiration for foreigners to carry out economic aggression, as well as those who are unlearned and unscrupulous, engaging in quackery. The substance of foreign doctors in China is analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Those who aim to preach: Foreign doctors who aim to preach are undoubtedly Christians themselves. These people are able to endure hardship and possess a concept of compassion. They are mostly scattered in the Chinese interior, using missionary hospitals as their base. They are less common in major cities. These foreign doctors mostly graduated from provincial or private medical schools in their respective countries. After graduation, they volunteer to serve the church, first registering with the church's general headquarters in their own country, which then assigns them to serve in a certain country or region. Their compensation is mostly based on their years of service or family burden.</p>
<p>(2) Those who aim to make money: These doctors mostly gather in the major cities of China, using the Chinese people's tendency to admire foreigners, contacting compradors of various foreign firms to act as their introducers. Their consultation fees are surprisingly high, and they put on airs, bustling about all day long, entering and exiting the homes of celebrities and wealthy merchants. They have no concept of compassion and even lack a sense of shame. They will do anything to achieve the goal of making money, even cheating and defrauding. Therefore, these people often open private practices and rarely serve in hospitals, not much different from Chinese quack doctors.</p>
<p>(3) Those who aim to conduct research: Among the foreign doctors in China, there are always those who come to China with the purpose of researching Eastern diseases. These doctors either serve in hospitals or open private practices. Their knowledge and experience are mostly substantial. After arriving in China, they often rank among famous doctors. Since they aim to study and conduct research, they disregard ordinary illnesses. When encountering difficult or rare diseases, they often stay up all night, immersing themselves in research, using patients as research materials and treating them as research tools. However, these foreign doctors are fewer in number in China, and their footprints can be found in both cities and the interior.</p>
<p>(4) Those who aim to make a living: In recent years, the number of foreign doctors coming to China from various countries to make a living has been increasing. These doctors often lack adequate qualifications, or they are foreign hospital nurses or medical professors' assistants. Since they are not trusted in their own countries and lack the means to earn a living, they have no choice but to cross the sea to China and use their practice as a means of survival. Their nature is not much different from those who aim to make money; they are also a type of foreign quack doctor.</p>
<p>(5) Those who aim to serve: Among the foreign doctors in China, those who aim to serve are very rare, but it cannot be categorically stated that there are none. Some medical school professors may fall into this category, but they are extremely few in number. From this, we can know the inside story of foreign doctors in China. I hope that the Chinese people will truly break the mentality of admiring foreigners and be vigilant.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Treating Lung Disease with Kerosene</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper's "Spring and Autumn" column published the kerosene treatment for lung disease from the Japanese magazine "Women's Friend," it has attracted a great deal of attention from people across the country. However, this publication, from a medical and pharmaceutical standpoint, has not dared to speak lightly. Later, in response to readers' requests, we published a translation by Mr. Ding Huikang, and discussion articles by Mr. Wang Qizhang and Mr. Yang Yusheng. Today, we are republishing three articles by Mr. Pang Jingzhou, Mr. Zhang Zhiguo, and Mr. Ding Huikang. Looking at the works of all the gentlemen, the conclusion is that kerosene treatment for lung disease is still in the research stage, and the public should not attempt it rashly. We use this discussion as a conclusion, and will no longer publish other similar articles. (Editor)</p>
<h3>The Kerosene Tide</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Since the Japanese women's magazine "Women's Friend" published the kerosene treatment for lung disease and it was translated and recorded by our country's daily newspapers, it has, on one hand, aroused the hopes and doubts of many patients, and on the other hand, aroused the attention and discussion of the medical community. It has been noisy and chaotic, and very lively. I have nothing to call it, so I have to call it the "kerosene tide."</p>
<p>I have the honor of being in the medical field, so I cannot avoid being washed by this chaotic tide. Recently, I have received phone calls, letters, and verbal inquiries from relatives, friends, and patients. There must be several cases a day, making it impossible to respond to them all. This shows that the trend is really not small.</p>
<p>Thinking carefully about why the phrase "kerosene treatment for lung disease" has caused such a tide, it is nothing more than people having three major mentalities.</p>
<p>First, the "simple remedy obsession" of the Chinese people. Generally, people who are sick, whether Chinese or foreign, want to take a shortcut and seek a quick cure. It is best to find an extremely simple medicine or an extremely simple method to relieve chronic diseases. People all over the world have the same heart and the same reasoning. Even in foreign medicine, no matter how developed it is, patients still嫌 it is too troublesome. Therefore, herbal remedies and folk methods still cannot be eradicated. In our country, there is a saying that goes, "A single simple remedy can enrage a famous doctor." Almost everyone who suffers from chronic diseases and has been treated ineffectively for a long time wants to find a single simple remedy to enrage the doctors who have treated them. So it can be said that the Chinese people have a special addiction to believing in simple remedies. Kerosene is a simple everyday commodity that every household knows and everyone can obtain. How can it not arouse the Chinese people's simple remedy madness? Moreover, famous doctors are using simple remedies to speak there. So the kerosene tide is especially successful.</p>
<p>Second, the patient's "hope fever." There are so many lung disease patients, the cost of treating lung disease is so expensive, and the symptoms of lung disease are so stubborn. Who doesn't want to find a shortcut to relieve this evil disease? Because they hope for a miraculous medicine too fervently, they grab at straws and hear kerosene being called a panacea. This is nothing more than human nature.</p>
<p>Third, the "worship of foreigners" mentality of the Chinese people. Recently, there have been more than one folk rumor about simple remedies for treating lung disease. For example, a few years ago, some people strongly said that water shield tonifies the lungs and Bletilla striata heals tuberculosis. But none of them were as lively as kerosene, and they gradually subsided soon after. But this time, kerosene is particularly riotous. The reason is that the kerosene news came from Japan, and the kerosene text was obtained from a Japanese magazine. It doesn't even matter what foreign magazine it is. And kerosene is not a domestic product. It is especially seen as</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>mysterious. Commonly known as "foreign oil," it has some foreign flavor. Weak will, nothing is worse than this. If someone publishes in a foreign newspaper that "grass paper contains vitamin Ｖｉｔａｍｉｎ and internal use can cure beriberi," I am afraid that some people will eat grass paper.</p>
<p>In this kerosene tide, besides the medical publications of various daily newspapers successively publishing debates, even small newspapers have some records. A few days ago, the Jingbao newspaper had an article mentioning kerosene treatment for lung disease with an expression of surprise. Then, a post signed "Expert" provided an explanation. This expert's argument is quite straightforward. Now I will transcribe it on the left.</p>
<p>(1) All so-called inventions in modern medicine must have a solid theoretical basis or a statistical analysis of a large number of practical examples.</p>
<p>(2) As for inventors, before studying a certain treatment method, they must first have a motivation. This motivation must be a chance discovery (such as an effect on a certain Japanese or a certain woman, etc.). However, discovery cannot be immediately called invention.</p>
<p>(3) According to the various articles, kerosene treatment for lung disease is probably still in the research stage after discovery and has not yet reached the invention stage.</p>
<p>(4) No matter what kind of scientific professional personnel, when they discover a certain fact and are conducting research, it seems that they should not immediately announce it to the public and call it an invention. Medicine cannot be compared to other disciplines and should be more careful and comprehensive before submitting it for discussion.</p>
<p>(5) Specialists are in the discussion period, not the contribution period, so there is no need to promote it, let alone promote it to society. Therefore, the daily newspaper discussing the latest experimental medicine has already lost the characteristics of a popular reading material.</p>
<p>(6) After the issue of kerosene treatment for tuberculosis has been published in various magazines and newspapers at home and abroad, it has caused much disturbance among the public. This is truly a mistake of "announcing without clarification" and "reporting minor matters as major." Therefore, the Jingbao newspaper said that it was making a lot of noise.</p>
<p>(7) Medicine has no factions, and learning has no limits. Following the path and progressing can benefit society, bring the dead back to life, and grow flesh on bones. If one tries to innovate and show off and eagerly uses a nascent learning topic (a problem that can be studied in theory) as a tool for business, I will always think it is unacceptable.</p>
<p>But besides this, I feel that I still have to supplement it - if you want to determine the actual effect of a drug in treating a disease, you must first determine the diagnosis of the disease. According to the report of the Tokyo Municipal Sanatorium outside of Tokyo, they have already determined that the kerosene treatment of sixty-three patients with tuberculosis is not good and has negative effects. But the patients mentioned in Women's Friend magazine and the recent Chinese experiments say "appetite increased greatly, spirit is vigorous". Comparing the two, they seem to be too far apart. I don't doubt that the reporter is lying, but I suspect that those who have a slight effect from kerosene are perhaps not real tuberculosis patients. Why? The reporter once heard of a German professor who implemented a psychological therapy, which used extremely toxic poisons in extremely small amounts (not toxic). For example, they put mercuric chloride in a glass of clear water to treat toothache for people with nervous disorders, and it was surprisingly effective. So maybe there are many people with neurasthenia who are afraid of having tuberculosis, and they are comforted by drinking a little</p>
<p>a small amount of kerosene - calm down, and so it may be.</p>
<p>However, in the end, I still have to say that the kerosene treatment for lung disease itself is still a topic worthy of research in medicine, but it must be done following the path of scientific research, and it is definitely not the time for propaganda, especially medical publications in newspapers are places for instilling general medical knowledge, and the purpose of contributing manuscripts is to make readers have a definite understanding, not to make readers surprised and astonished.</p>
<p>As for doctors discussing with doctors themselves, let alone kerosene, they can also talk about the efficacy of large amounts of arsenic, as long as it is not used within the scope of killing people.</p>
<p>The nature of the Chinese people is good at imitating and not good at researching. What policies, what doctrines, are nothing more than copying and pasting from the east and west, making a few buzzwords and instilling them into people's minds, creating political maniacs for politicians and young people, and bringing the country to a state of danger. If major medical problems are also propaganda in the form of slogans, wouldn't it lead to no survivors?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, it is easy to start a fire and difficult to put it out. Kerosene treatment for lung disease has become a trend, and I am afraid that there will be no lack of people trying it for a while. Fortunately, the truth recently investigated by Dr. Yang Yusheng from Japan has already been published in the previous issue of this publication. Mr. Ding Huikang has also stated the source of the translation and it has been completely published. I think this tide should come to a temporary end. As for the gentleman who has already tried it, he can only freely gather his reports as reference materials for research in the future!</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Kerosene Therapy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhiguo</p>
<p>Recently, the theory of kerosene treatment for lung disease has been widely spread in society. This theory originally appeared in a certain women's magazine in Japan. I don't know whether the medical community in Japan has paid attention to this matter. However, in recent times, transportation is convenient and news is well-informed. If there is a novel theory or surprising discovery in the medical community, they are mostly reprinted in medical publications of various countries, and scholars will definitely submit articles for discussion. In volume and quantity. Now, the treatment of kerosene is unheard of in other countries, but it is only being promoted in our country. This is really strange. Moreover, the Japanese invention of this method was not published in the official medical reports of their country, but was first published in a women's magazine, which makes people unable to avoid doubt. In my opinion, regardless of whether this method is reasonable or effective, if people in the medical community think it has research value, they should first add theoretical and experimental research, discuss it with each other in the medical community, and then apply it to patients after having considerable results, and then publish it to the public. If people are rashly used as experimental subjects, and its method of use is published, and its effectiveness is promoted, it seems inappropriate.</p>
<p>Although pharmacology has not yet reached its peak, it is like heaven and earth compared to the past. In the past, all drugs came from trial use or from folk methods. For example, quinine treats malaria. Today's drug researchers not only analyze drugs to know their chemical structure, but also explore their effects, that is, study their molecular structure. Then there must be a certain physiological function. Therefore, artificial drugs are often more effective than natural products, and inventors of drugs must first have a theory before engaging in synthesis. Before the drug is produced, its function can be predicted. For example, the invention of Salvarsan and atoxyl. The composition of kerosene has been known for a long time. If it really has a therapeutic effect on tuberculosis, it is not very difficult to explore its theory. Either the components of kerosene can directly kill tuberculosis bacteria, or it can cause a physiological function that indirectly harms tuberculosis bacteria. However, how kerosene is absorbed and excreted after it is taken, and what chemical changes occur in the body, must also be studied in detail through animal experiments. In short, in today's world, using the theory and method of pharmacological chemistry and chemical therapy to study whether kerosene has the effect of treating lung tuberculosis is feasible. However, not doing this and blindly listening to rumors and using trial use as a method of research is not what a scholar should do. Moreover, using patients as experimental subjects is against humanity. Japanese doctors may do this, so why must it be used as a lesson and followed? I ask my colleagues, what do you think?</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Kerosene Treatment for the Lungs</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The tuberculosis bacillus does not directly produce toxins. The various unpleasant phenomena that occur in the human body are entirely due to allergic reactions (Allergie). Therefore, sometimes the lesions are not very extensive, yet high fever and hemoptysis occur, with dangerous signs appearing frequently. This is due to the intensification of the allergic reaction. In other cases, both lungs may be completely occupied by lesions, yet the person walks normally. This is not due to different types of pathogens, but to different strengths of reaction.</p>
<p>Since the German physician Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacillus, he later invented tuberculin, a specific agent for tuberculosis. However, to this day, this agent has not achieved outstanding results in treatment and is no longer widely used in modern tuberculosis treatment. Therefore, whether there is a specific drug for tuberculosis is not only an important issue in the medical field but also has a great impact on the health of people worldwide. In our country, where tuberculosis is widespread, it is a matter of great concern to both doctors and patients.</p>
<p>We know that 40% of the tuberculosis bacillus is composed of wax, which may be the reason why it is difficult to eradicate. Although science is advancing rapidly, a specific drug for tuberculosis has not yet been discovered, and we are still waiting for it like a cloud in a great drought. Recently, kerosene treatment has become popular in Japan, with opposing and supporting factions, each with considerable reasons. Generally, the success of a thing must first have opponents. If kerosene is not effective, its trial will disappear like smoke in a few months. If it is effective, then of course, there will be no opposition. During this trial period, the more opponents there are, the clearer the truth becomes, which can be predicted. This is a phenomenon that should exist in the academic world. The Japanese opponents say: Lin Chunxiong, a pharmacy student at the Imperial University, said that lung disease is all about recuperation, and kerosene is unreliable. Hirai Fumio of the Hospital of the Medical Department of the Imperial University said that the tuberculosis bacillus has strong resistance, and kerosene is definitely not an effective bactericide. Oya Akiryo of the Kitazato Institute Hospital said that kerosene therapy has no basis, and the harm outweighs the benefits. Dr. Yo Yu Ryo, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the Imperial University, said that kerosene treatment for the lungs is pure superstition and is worried and trembling for the 1.5 million patients in Japan.</p>
<p>Those who support it, such as Hayami Inichi, said that the harmful effects of kerosene on the tuberculosis bacillus can be seen on the culture medium. According to his experience, kerosene is absolutely harmless. Although it is not 100% effective, if it is taken under the guidance of an experienced doctor, its effect is definitely incomparable to other drugs. The amount to drink depends on the patient's condition and physique, but in general, it is most reasonable to gradually increase the amount from a small amount. If there is diarrhea or vomiting, the amount should be reduced next time. The indications for kerosene are pleurisy, pneumonia, nephritis, hepatitis, and extremely weak tuberculosis patients without complications, all of which have specific effects. In addition, it can also be used for diabetes and asthma and can drive out duodenal worms. The results of the actual test will be published in a medical journal soon. Since the announcement that kerosene can cure lung disease, it has attracted great attention from the public. If it is effective, it can be called the most economical treatment. If it is harmful, then millions of people will suffer from its poison. Therefore, everyone wants to know the truth. The Japanese Dawn Society, one of the tuberculosis prevention associations, believes that it is better to collect human evidence than to make empty words. Therefore, last winter, they collected trial records of patients taking kerosene and obtained 80 cases, saying that 32 people were effective, and 21 people were harmful (including 11 people who had incorrect drinking methods). The rest were ineffective. (Please note that if there are people in the country who have tried drinking it, please submit a brief report of their experimental experience, whether effective or ineffective, to me. I will publish a special collection to report it publicly, which I believe is also something you are concerned about. The report obtained by the Dawn Society is currently being printed and will be published soon.)</p>
<p>Why is kerosene effective? It has not yet been determined. It is roughly believed that after absorption in the body, although it cannot kill the tuberculosis bacillus, it may have the ability to inhibit the reproduction of the tuberculosis bacillus after being absorbed into the blood, shortening the treatment time.</p>
<p>Its efficacy is already incomparable to ordinary drugs.</p>
<p>There are no accurate statistics on lung disease patients in our country. Judging from the proportion of patients in Japan, there should be more than 10 million patients in our country. Its impact on society and the country is significant. Therefore, research on the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis is our urgent task. Observing the numerous criticisms of kerosene treatment by Japanese scholars and the enthusiasm of patients trying it, I deeply feel the need for on-site trials. The first issue to be resolved is whether the patient will intensify the allergic reaction after drinking kerosene and have various unpleasant side effects, such as the lesion reaction often caused after injecting tuberculin, which leads to the aggravation of the disease. After all, human life is of utmost importance. Our responsibility is first to prevent the occurrence of disease, and second, to treat it so that it can be cured. If not, we should try to reduce the suffering. We must not rashly let people try it, which will only increase the suffering of those groaning in bed. Therefore, I have always wanted to try clinical trials, but then stopped.</p>
<p>During the outpatient visits, there were two incredible cases. A woman said that she had been suffering from lung disease for two years and had been bedridden for a month. Now, after drinking kerosene several times, she can actually get up. Therefore, she came to seek treatment. The second was a person from Pudong, whose experience was roughly the same. Trying kerosene, of course, cannot be used as an effective rule based on these two people alone. However, it can be generally proven that there is not much harm after drinking kerosene. I then proceeded to have hospitalized patients drink kerosene, a total of twelve cases. The initial dose was four cc, taken on an empty stomach in the evening. After that, the second dose was taken every four or five days, with the dose increased by two cc each time, up to twelve cc. Among them were two patients with intestinal tuberculosis, one with peritoneal tuberculosis, one with spinal tuberculosis, and two with severe bilateral infiltrative tuberculosis. All of the above were examined by X-ray and microscope. The prognosis of these people was extremely serious, but after kerosene treatment, there were no adverse effects, and many felt relieved. At the same time, of course, other reasonable therapies were also applied.</p>
<p>In short, the unpleasant phenomena of drinking kerosene are diarrhea, abdominal pain, insomnia, and fever, but most of them disappear after only one or two days. After drinking it for the second or third time, there are no more diarrhea and other phenomena. The good effects on patients are mental refreshment and increased appetite. As for the rest, the experimental time is still short, and patients have taken it no more than five or six times at most, so I cannot say much.</p>
<p>Based on my personal observation over the past month, the effect of kerosene has not yet been determined. It is best to try it to a harmless extent. If you think that kerosene is a sacred drug for treating the lungs and hope to be completely cured after drinking it two or three times, that is almost impossible. It is also used incorrectly if you think that the harm outweighs the benefits. The first trial should be based on the patient's constitution, the degree of weakness, and the strength of the stomach and intestines, and a small amount should be tried. The next drink should be separated by a considerable amount of time, and you should not force it to be effective. If any adverse symptoms occur, stop immediately. It is better to have the guidance of a doctor, so that the danger is less. At the same time, do not neglect the original natural therapy, so what the result will be, I dare not say at this time. I plan to travel to Japan soon to see the results of treatment there. This mystery of kerosene treatment for the lungs must be broken and told to all readers. (I apologize for not replying to inquiries individually)</p>

<h3>Straw Dogs</h3>
<p>— Tianshan</p>
<p>It is said that the witchcraft of the Chu people was very prevalent, which is probably closely related to the superstitions and customs of the Miao people. Let folk custom scholars deal with this issue. What is most interesting is that witches and sorcerers often use dry grass to make a dog shape, respectfully place it in a box, and tie it with many floral fabrics. Then, they fast and bathe, and worship or dance to it. After doing all this, they throw it away. This thing, the ancients called "straw dog."</p>
<p>This trick is seen in ancient books. I wonder if there are still such customs in Hunan and Hubei in recent times? Lao Tzu once said: "Heaven and earth are not benevolent, and regard all things as straw dogs." Then this trend was also spreading in the north at that time. The so-called "not benevolent" means that when it is useful, it is treated with great respect, and after it has been displayed, it is discarded. "Those who walk on it step on its head, and those who recover from unconsciousness take it and burn it," which means that it is trampled on and burned.</p>
<p>Is it for curing diseases, eliminating disasters, or playing with it? It is difficult to know now. It probably has a considerable effect! Heaven and earth created mankind probably without any special effect. Its being "playing with" is perhaps very possible. All things have their formation, destruction, increase, decrease, beginning, end, birth, death, and Lao Tzu regards them as straw dogs. Obviously in two different eras and environments, the straw dog itself suddenly ascends to heaven and suddenly enters the earth, and the straw dog itself has no place to put its mind.</p>
<p>It seems that many things in the present world are not like this. Westerners treat Chinese people, superiors treat inferiors, and even the opposite sex treats the opposite sex, isn't it also in this way! Fly it in front, clamp it in the back, use it on the left, and discard it on the right. Chinese people are a peaceful nation! An ancient country! Confucius! Friendliness! Admirable! Heroes! ... So hotly praised, flattered, and touted, regardless of whether the Chinese can withstand it or not. When the Chinese have all become slaves to the white or Japanese people, and the fat of this nation has been sucked away, they will all have achieved fame and satisfaction. At this time, they will no longer be friendly or admirable, and will trample them into the mud pit, not allowing them to turn over. The tone at this time will also change: The Chinese were originally barbarians, only fit to be slaves! ...</p>
<p>Has anyone ever played in a brothel! He should know the reason for so much affection. Perhaps a disgraced official or an abandoned woman feels the most intimate about this! But many modern heroes or those who aspire to be heroes are still fluttering because they are straw dogs, forgetting their shape, and only thinking of long live, long live, long live!</p>
<h3>The Passing of Spring</h3>
<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>(1) Swaddling clothes, cradle, bed, "Simmons" bed... People grow, things change.</p>
<p>Crying, laughing, singing, dancing, scheming, galloping... Baby - young master - great man - great man often dies in his "Simmons" bed.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>People grow, things change, today farming, picking up the hoe: tomorrow working, picking up the axe...</p>
<p>Green land, drops of sweat. Pitch-black factory, oil-like blood, blood-volume of oil, driving, producing, consuming the labor of the worker.</p>
<p>Rice is not worth money, but the land is getting brighter and brighter. Blood and sweat are also useless, peddling, auctioning, sacrificing... Countless people are in the wilderness and cannot find their final destination.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>All seasons are spring, and the name of spring will disappear from now on. Three hundred and sixty days of scorching summer or severe winter, there is no spring, and the name of spring will disappear from now on.</p>
<p>The entire century is a recession, and what has disappeared is the spring in the entire century?</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Thinking in a "Simmons" bed</p>
<p>The great man of money, women, and honor is melancholy, the passing of spring!</p>
<p>Lying on the grass, looking at the empty sky, the desolate land, nothing was brought from the womb, and now there is still nothing empty-handed. There are calluses on the hands, but they cannot fill the hunger in the stomach.</p>
<p>Flowers bloom but there is no fruit!</p>
<p>Spring has passed! The era is in need of wind and rain!</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw two soldiers riding war horses galloping wildly on the street, without whips or guns, and their waists were full of blooming peach blossoms. Today when I went out, I met a woman playing with willow branches.</p>
<p>I don't know who the soldier's flowers will be given to; the woman's willow branches must have been broken because they were tied to something.</p>
<p>Is true spring really passing away like this?</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>I often tear off calendars every few days, and this year's Easter has inadvertently gone into the wastebasket again. Jesus Christ suffered in the spring and resurrected in the spring.</p>
<p>Is spring with "God"? Amen.</p>
<p>"The Passing of Spring" is probably an atheist again.</p>
<h3>Cui Lake in Kunming</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Although I live in Kunming, for the sake of life, I only have the opportunity to visit Cui Lake on holidays.</p>
<p>Because I haven't been there for a long time, I don't know when spring has quietly arrived at Cui Lake. The entire lake is a jade-green, lovable new green color. The willows on the lake embankment, illuminated by the rising sun, are like young girls after bathing, gazing into the wind, gracefully standing. Clamped in this charming and beautiful green shade are red peach blossoms, dressed so charmingly, as if smiling shyly!</p>
<p>A bend of river water surrounds half of Cui Lake. The clear ripples are sparkling, washing away people's turbid thoughts. The willow branches on the river bank are floating on the water, floating, - a washing woman squats by the river, letting the frivolous willow branches stroke her hair: why not? They are so gentle, so comfortable.</p>
<p>Walking slowly along the lake embankment, I feel like I am the master of Cui Lake at this time. On this morning with birds chirping and the sky clear, there are no vulgar guests dressed in red and green in the afternoon, no cluttered voices, no lofty scholars drinking tea, only a quiet atmosphere.</p>
<p>The vermilion pavilions and terraces are half-hidden in the dense willow groves. Shuiyue Pavilion and Haixin Pavilion stand quietly, without the liveliness of the lotus flowers blooming in summer. Occasionally, a big fish leaps out of the water, making a "splash" sound, breaking the silence on the water.</p>
<p>In the hot summer, the Green Willow Village, where tea drinkers are crowded and at its peak for a while, is very deserted and the wooden doors are tightly closed. The melodious singing and the plaintive flute sounds can no longer be heard. Only a red cherry blossom extends its head over the dry bamboo fence, as if mocking the bare poplar tree opposite: why don't you bloom?</p>
<p>The yellow walls and red tiles of the swimming pool are reflected in the tender green leaves. A farmer is driving a small boat from the opposite side. In the clear and mirror-like water, I see the azure sky, countless elusive reflections of trees - emerald green, how lovely is this world in the water!</p>
<p>Walking to the bridge, looking back: the green willows and red peaches are like shy beauties, covered with a layer of light gauze-like white mist, only those closer ones still vaguely show some vague and clear figures.</p>
<p>Several white herons floating on the water, seeing people coming, are frightened, raise their heads and glance, and then fly away with a "flap" sound. Swimming to the embankment are red fish, green fish, ...</p>
<p>Standing on the bridge, facing the gentle and intoxicating morning breeze, listening to the clear island sounds, I can't help but have a leisurely and otherworldly thought.</p>
<h3>Birds in a Cage</h3>
<p>— Pu Feng</p>
<p>Don't sing, little thing!</p>
<p>Has happiness ever treated you kindly?</p>
<p>Has happiness ever given you everything—</p>
<p>I'm sad, you pretend to be happy in a small cage!</p>
<p>Don't jump, little thing!</p>
<p>Bits of food are given to you by people,</p>
<p>Drops of cold water are given to you by people! — I'm sad, you jump shamelessly in the cage!</p>
<p>Ah! Through your bars, little thing,</p>
<p>Take a look at the vast blue world!</p>
<h3>Sketches of Beiping (6) W窝窝头</h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>The working class in Beiping usually does not eat rice. The "Beijing cuisine" of Shanghai's Tongxinglou and the "Manchu Han Imperial Feast" on the signs of restaurants all over the country are only the tastes of the pleasure-seeking class in Beiping and are not enough to represent the general diet of Beiping people. What they eat is not things like "roasted duck" or "stir-fried fish fillets," but "pancakes," "buckwheat noodles," "sesame cakes," and "窝窝头" - especially "窝窝头."</p>
<p>Their families can make this kind of coarse food, but it seems that many people also buy food on the street. There are many open-air stalls on the roadside in the marketplace, selling all kinds of food. This is their "restaurant," the place where they buy "satiety." These stalls are very low. The stall surface is a wooden board about the size of a square table placed on a wicker basket, and there are low stools about half a foot high around it. There are some bowls and plates on the stall surface, and in the center there is a pot of steaming soup. Next to it is another wooden board, with a steamer on it, thickly covered with burlap. When opened, there are "buns," "hua juan," and "窝窝头." "Pancakes," "sesame cakes," and "sliced noodles" do not need to be kept warm and are displayed openly on the stall surface.</p>
<p>Of course, the customers who patronize this kind of stall are the so-called "lower class," especially rickshaw pullers. They run with oily sweat on their faces, earn dozens of copper coins, and need to stuff a few "窝窝头" into their stomachs to have the strength to pull a second business. The price doesn't need to be asked, everyone knows it: although there is no discount, there are no extra expenses such as "commission" or "tip."</p>
<p>Four large copper coins on the stall surface, and the stall owner will feel out a 窝窝头 from under the burlap and give it to you - no need to ask. This yellow thing, two and two-thirds inches in diameter, is made of coarse corn or millet flour; it has a round bottom and a high top, with a very deep recessed pit at the bottom, hence this strange name. The steaming corn fragrance and the slightly sweet corn taste are the comfort of the hungry, replacing the position of "roasted duck" and "stir-fried fish fillets." If you spend a few more copper coins, you can eat half a catty of "pancakes" and drink a bowl of spinach soup; you won't lose strength and "die" when pulling the rickshaw.</p>
<p>After running all day, if you earn more money, you can have a full meal, even eat one or two pieces of pork head meat or a dish of soybean sprouts and other delicacies. But this is close to the "Manchu Han Imperial Feast."</p>
<h3>A New Discussion on "Vernacular" and "Classical Chinese" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Some people also feel that vernacular writing is not conducive to recitation, which is true. Since classical Chinese has evolved into spoken style, many old literati feel unaccustomed; if you ask old literati to teach spoken style writing, it is like a monkey leaving the tree, with no skills at all. Originally, classical Chinese attached the greatest importance to prosody. Lin Qinnan said, "The way of sound has its differences in speed, height, ups and downs, and inflection, not only in rhymed texts, but also in unrhymed texts... Try to read the texts of the ancients, there are those that are booming, those that are subtle and important, those that are urgent strings and short pipes, and those that are slow and peaceful songs. Generally speaking, those who speak of music are more harmonious, and those who describe sorrow are good at swallowing... This is natural and spontaneous, and even the authors may not be aware of it!" He understood its essence. The ancient prose of the Tongcheng School is concise, the prosody is harmonious, and it is easy to recite. Old literati taught people to write essays, starting with recitation; when they wrote essays themselves, they would also shake their heads and hum, all doing the work of harmonizing prosody. Vernacular writing has added many words, and each sentence is very long, and if the arrangement is not appropriate, it always sounds awkward, so Japanese people always feel unaccustomed. The vernacular of vernacular writing is separated from the vernacular of spoken language by another layer; reading vernacular writing is not as smooth as listening to people speak, and new literati also tacitly admit that vernacular writing is only a work to be read, not a work to be recited. Mr. Lin Yutang hates the writing of vernacular and loves the whiteness of classical Chinese; saying that "the quotations are concise and can be like classical Chinese, and the simplicity can be like vernacular, with the freshness of vernacular and without the garrulousness of vernacular." In fact, Mr. Lin cannot get used to artificial sentences, and wants to restore natural sentences. The quotation style is closer to spoken language, so it suits his taste. A few years ago, Mr. Xu Binbin advocated theatrical prose, saying that "the classification of theatrical words has two major categories: singing words and recitations, and recitations also have technical whiteness and natural whiteness. Technical whiteness is a kind of musical pronunciation technique, between European (ization) and speech. Its success is based on the naturalness of the human air zone and the needs of Chinese square monosyllabic characters." He wants to use natural rhythm to create a new theatrical prose, which is quite close to Mr. Lin Yutang's proposition.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the complex structure of vernacular writing must be retained, and natural rhythm must also be utilized; vernacular writing should not only be a work to be read, but should still be injected with prosody to be revived as a work to be recited, which is very clear. How can we work hard to achieve this goal? I would like to put forward a small opinion: writing and language are both advancing and influencing each other; if we hope that writing will progress, we must hope that language will progress first. The writings of the philosophers of the past greatly benefited from the trend of itinerant debates, and the prevalence of Qing talk in the Wei and Jin Dynasties produced magnificent beautiful writing: if we want to produce lively vernacular teaching writing, we must abandon the false virtues of silence and few words advocated by the Neo-Confucianists of the Song and Ming Dynasties; Confucius had a subject of language, and a writer should not bow his head at the desk to decorate his words, but should practice his tongue in the streets. Language is always the advanced predecessor of writing, seeking the progress of writing in language can also be said to be a small restoration work: (End)</p>

<h3>Half a Day's Homework (6)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Some staff members in the field, wearing long robes and mandarin jackets, with ribbons pinned to their chests, were constantly running back and forth in front of the podium, so busy, as if they could never finish what they were supposed to do. They were truly enthusiastic, and they were really exerting themselves for the new country.</p>
<p>The heads of the school teams, along with the disciplinary directors, teachers, and principals, were all gathered in the mat shed behind the stage, laughing and talking. Looking at them, no one seemed to think that today was a day of sorrow. Yet, they were all intellectuals above the general public. Amidst the noisy crowd, a large whirlwind suddenly swept in from the northwest corner of the field, blowing the sand and dust on the ground into the air. People scattered to avoid the wind, shouting. The wind slowly crossed the podium and blew past the front of our team towards the outside of the wall. In such a clear autumn, no one expected such a large whirlwind. As if encountering something novel, people muttered haphazardly:</p>
<p>"Such a big whirlwind, I wonder what it means."</p>
<p>"It's so big, reaching all the way up to the sky."</p>
<p>"Such a clear day, where did this whirlwind come from!"</p>
<p>"There must be a story."</p>
<p>This was indeed an unexpected adventure. Not only did the stuffy and noisy field immediately change its appearance, but I could also use this whirlwind to symbolize our future misfortune. Some people kept shouting that they had sand in their eyes. This could be said to be a handful of sand thrown to blind us before the arrival of a great calamity. One day, this great whirlwind will come. The flying sand and stones will blind our eyes and injure our bodies. It is the Japanese imperialism that devours people without shedding blood!</p>
<p>I remember when I was little, playing outside the door, whenever a whirlwind came, I would sing the song my mother taught me. My mother said that the song could scare away the whirlwind:</p>
<p>"Whirlwind, whirlwind, you are a ghost, three broadswords will chop your legs."</p>
<p>After a while, the whirlwind would blow away, and I really thought the song had scared it away. Thinking about this interesting thing, no matter how funny it is, at least it still had some power to resist with broadswords as weapons. But now, who dares to say anything about the real great whirlwind in front of us!</p>
<p>Three cars drove into the field in a row, and the police were densely stationed on the roadside, frequently saluting. I knew that the important person must have arrived.</p>

<h3>International Co-Governance</h3>
<p>— Gushe</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that a French morning newspaper reporter, Bailly, published a statement in Chongqing, saying that Japan had requested that various countries jointly manage China. An international派, Cadogan, was appointed to investigate the Yangtze River area, Smith was appointed to investigate the Yellow River area, and Bailly himself was appointed to investigate the southwest. Our diplomatic circles believe that this has never been heard of before, and stated that Japan has always harbored ambitions towards China, but the international community would never be so deceived by the Japanese. It is believed that there is absolutely no such fact. This news is extremely interesting. The theory of international co-governance of China did not originate today. It has been a consistent conspiracy of international imperialism against China for almost a decade. However, in the past, they were somewhat secretive and difficult to propose, always putting it forward from the side, with the reality but without claiming the name. But this time, Bailly actually openly spoke of co-governance within Chinese territory. Frank and open, without any concealment. This seems to be the first time.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that Bailly is just a newspaper reporter, and his remarks may not have power and may not be fully believed. Therefore, our diplomatic circles said: "It is believed that there is absolutely no such fact." That is not the case. The issue of international co-governance has in fact been discussed among international imperialists for many years. Ultimately, because the interests of various countries are different and conflicts are too severe, although there are discussions, it has not yet been realized. It is not that they did not know about co-governance earlier, but that the steps of various countries were inconsistent and there was no way to implement co-governance. But now: the outbreak of the September 18th Incident by Japan, although it destroyed the balance of power in East Asia, at the same time, the League of Nations technical cooperation and the US cotton and wheat loan have somewhat restored this balance. Japan has occupied "Manchuria", and what it currently needs is to urgently "build Manchuria". For the time being, it seems that there is no need to develop further into the interior. The United Kingdom has light interests in the three northeastern provinces. Except for the issue of the Indian cotton market, it has no particularly fierce conflict with Japan. Japan's two attacks on China, the September 18th and January 28th incidents, did not directly threaten British interests in China. Therefore, there is nothing that cannot be compromised between the United Kingdom and Japan in their China policy. At the same time, although the United States stands in a sharp opposition position with Japan in its China policy, Japan has already secretly sent signals to the United States: except for Manchuria, you can slaughter the fat ones. Japan's limited concessions will somewhat win back a lot of goodwill from the United States. In addition, the conflict between the United Kingdom and the United States has also made the United States worry about not taking too extreme a position against Japan. Therefore, just over a year after Stimson's non-recognition doctrine was announced, the United States and Japan heard about mutual understanding again. At the same time, the end of the stability of world capitalism is shaking the seats of every financial capitalist. At this time, they also feel the need to temporarily join hands with those who have different interests, create a considerable balance, and then use all their strength to jointly carve up the world's colonies and squeeze them to compensate for their own losses. In this way, international co-governance of China has emerged again in response to the times.</p>
<p>This is not something that came out of thin air. This is the inevitable product of history advancing to a certain stage.</p>
<p>Various countries feel the need for a consistent approach to China, and the result is "co-governance". Conversely, it is "partition". This is not a question that we can decide by ourselves whether it is "believed that it is absolutely not a fact" or "believed that it is a fact", nor is it a question of whether we are willing or not. It is what they like to do. We have already tasted enough of the taste of "division". The Chinese politics of the past two decades is a concrete manifestation of it. Now, let's wait to taste the taste of "co-governance".</p>
<h3>Record of Bumping into a Nail Early in the Morning</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Last night, in a dream, I was turned upside down. A poor man suddenly became a rich man, living in luxury, calling servants, pouring ginseng soup. My throat was scalded and I woke up with three loud coughs. I opened my eyes and saw that the room was dark. The clock was striking two o'clock. It turned out that it was a dream of joy. I carefully savored the situation in the dream. I really felt that I couldn't bear to let it go. I couldn't help but feel hot in my heart, and sweat soaked my whole body, penetrating my shirt and pants, and seeping through the quilt. I was like a water frog, tossing and turning for three hours without falling asleep. When I woke up in the morning, I suddenly saw sunlight shining on the foot of the bed. I quickly turned over and kicked off the quilt. The wonton vendor in front of the door had already left. I could only endure my hunger and skip breakfast. I sat on a stool in a daze, thinking about the dream last night. Honored guests don't come to humble places, and there's no smoke without fire. It's not without a good omen. So I opened the drawer and carefully played with a strip of aviation lottery tickets that I bought the other day. I looked at myself in the mirror, examining my face with my left eye and carefully looking at the aviation lottery tickets with my right eye, comparing the two to see if there was any point of agreement. While I was leisurely lost in thought, I suddenly heard a knock. Second Aunt pushed the door open and entered. "Alas, getting up at dawn is the way of the sages. Today, you only turn over when the sun is high. How can a scholar be like this?" Second Aunt saw that I was still disheveled, so she couldn't help but teach me a lesson first. I could only nod in response. She suddenly saw that I was playing with aviation lottery tickets and immediately asked what I was playing with. After this question, I was immediately overjoyed. So I waved my hands and feet, talking eloquently, "This is called an aviation lottery ticket, issued by the government for the people of the whole country to buy. Each ticket has a number, and each number is divided into ten strips. Each ticket costs ten yuan, and each strip costs one yuan. It is held every three months. The money earned is used by the government to build aviation highways and partly as bonuses. The method of distributing the bonuses is to publicly shake out the first prize, second prize, third prize, etc. of the numbers sold. If the number of the first prize drawn matches the one I bought, one strip can get 50,000 yuan, and one ticket can get 500,000 yuan. This move is perfect. The government can collect bits and pieces, and the people can have a way to get rich. If you are unlucky and don't win, the cost is minimal. If you are lucky and win, you can start a family from scratch and become a great fortune from abject poverty. It is also very happy. In the eyes of a poor man, it is really a shortcut to success." I opened the floodgates and poured out everything, spitting everywhere. I suddenly saw that Second Aunt's face was unhappy, and the corners of her mouth were twitching, as if she wanted to stop me from speaking. I immediately stopped, but a mouthful of spit had already landed on Second Aunt's　angle.　　　bright pearl one,　　　Aunt　shook her head and　said, "The so-called aviation lottery ticket is a lottery ticket. It drives the people of the world to take a gamble on luck, throwing away their hard-earned money in the hope of one in ten thousand, to the extent that they will not be ruined. Lottery tickets were banned in the past. How can the so-called aviation lottery tickets happen in disguise now?" When I heard this, I couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. I immediately closed the windows and doors to prevent any old woman outside the wall from daring to make absurd remarks. Second Aunt ignored it and continued to talk endlessly, "When your Second Grandfather was alive, he was away all year round and never sent a penny home. When the bad news came that year, I rushed out overnight. The person had already died, and the room was empty except for a broken cotton quilt. There were thirteen copper coins next to the pillow, and a box. When I opened it, it was full of lottery tickets that hadn't won. I cried so much that I wanted to die. He bought lottery tickets all his life and ended up like this. Young man, don't seek to bury your head in progress, but hope for windfall money to come. Will there be no good results? Will there be no good results?" Second Aunt left angrily with a face full of anger. I stood with my head bowed, not daring to raise my head or argue. I could only nod and send her out the door.</p>
<h3>Eating Sugar Cane</h3>
<p>— Chizi</p>
<p>I had just finished dinner and was strolling down the street with a friend. After crossing the intersection of red and green lights and walking past the grand theater with its colorful lights, we finally arrived at a fruit shop.</p>
<p>Various kinds of fruits were displayed on the fruit stall, long ones and round ones. But for some reason, I wanted to eat sugar cane, so I bought two sections with money. In this world, everything can be bought with money, and I couldn't help but feel proud in front of the sugar cane.</p>
<p>I quickly returned to the school, wiped the rusty knife clean, and began to attack the sugar cane girl.</p>
<p>First, I scraped off the skin of the sugar cane girl, and she turned from green to yellow. Then, I cut her horizontally into several sections and sent them to my mouth. I applied heavy pressure with my teeth, and the juice flowed out copiously. I sucked, I sucked madly. The sugar cane girl seemed to have no resistance at all, so I became even more presumptuous and frantically bit and sucked again, finally squeezing the sugar cane girl from plump to thin, and from thin to withered.</p>
<p>The sugar cane girl seemed to have nothing left to squeeze, so I threw it on the ground.</p>
<p>I looked at the messy residue lying quietly on the ground,　, revealing a triumphant smile.</p>
<h3>Environment and Nature</h3>
<p>— Mengshi</p>
<p>Environment and nature are the two elements that govern human behavior. Environment can make people do good, and it can also make people do evil; nature will make you become a good person, and it will also make you become a bad person. Since a person's actions cannot escape the influence of environment and nature, it can be seen how closely and significantly environment and nature are related to human behavior.</p>
<p>What is the original substance of human nature? There are three theories about this. (1) Advocates of the theory of innate goodness say that human nature is endowed from birth and is good. The reason why there are evil people in society is that their behavior is cultivated after birth; in other words, it is influenced by the environment. (2) The argument of advocates of the theory of innate evil is the opposite, believing that the nature that a person brings from birth is evil; but this evil nature can also be changed for the better by the influence of the environment. (3) There is a theory of reconciliation. This school of thought says that human nature is like a blank sheet of paper, neither good from birth nor inherently evil; it can be good or evil, and it changes red or black when rendered by the environment.</p>
<p>Regarding the goodness or evil of human nature, this belongs to the realm of metaphysics, and we will not bother with it for now. However, whether nature is good, evil, or neither good nor evil, we cannot but admit that nature and behavior have a very deep relationship. Here, let's first talk about the influence of the environment on behavior. We often see the same person behaving in a certain way in a certain environment, and behaving in another way in a different environment. What is the reason for this? This is because the environment in which the person is located is different before and after; therefore, the actions they express are also different.</p>
<p>A person's behavior has a very significant impact on society and should bear a responsibility for their actions. But since mankind understood that its actions are governed by the environment, many people have shirked the responsibility for their actions onto the environment,</p>
<p>wanting the environment to bear it for them. It is an undeniable fact that many illegal behaviors of human beings are often caused by a bad environment. For example, when a person is oppressed by life and is in great pain, if they are unwilling to submit, they will resist, or take risks and seek survival from death. Another example is the great Shanghai society in which we live, which is a den for creating various crimes. The environment of Shanghai society is extremely bad; a group of people with pure behavior, once they step into this place, will engage in acts of adultery and crime. All of this is clear evidence that the environment controls people's actions. According to this, a person's behavior cannot be controlled independently and is completely at the mercy of the external environment; then their behavior is obviously passive; the responsibility for their behavior is of course not on themselves, but should be shouldered by the environment.</p>
<p>So, is the environment the source of all evil? Is there no autonomy in a person's actions other than being governed by the environment? If this is really the case</p>
<p>, then mankind is nothing more than a machine, a slave to the environment: since its behavior is entirely directed by the environment, the responsibility for its behavior must also be given to the environment</p>
<p>to shoulder. However, we often see that some people are born with a good and upright nature, and their behavior is very disciplined and they never want to do evil. There are also some people who are indeed born with a violent, fierce, and rebellious nature. There is no need to kill, but they insist on killing; they have enough food and clothing, but they still engage in theft and robbery: knowing that it is harmful to others and does not benefit themselves, they must harm others. Are all these actions forced by the environment? Should the responsibility for their crimes also be placed on the environment? Moreover, we also often see that in the same environment, several people of different qualities can be produced, or various differences can be created, and sometimes even contradictory behaviors. How should this be explained? In</p>
<p>Here, we cannot but admit that human actions are not only closely related to the environment; the influence they receive from nature is also very significant. Some people are born good, and no matter what kind of environment they are in, they will not change their nature; on the contrary, some people are inherently bad, and no matter how the environment changes, their behavior always deviates from the norm. However, this is only possible for those with a strong nature; if the nature is weak, it is not so; their behavior will change with the environment; in a good environment, their behavior will become good, and in a bad environment, their behavior will become bad. However, there is one point that must not be ignored, that is, the goodness or evil of nature is often caused by the environment; the so-called innate endowment, I think, is very thin? Therefore, we believe that the influence of the environment on human behavior is more powerful than nature.</p>
<p>According to the above, we know that a person's every move cannot escape the support of the environment and nature. Therefore, if we hope that human behavior can tend towards good and avoid evil, and can conform to the rules and laws, and dare not commit crimes and violate prohibitions, we should pay attention to the environment and nature, and transform the environment and nature. Nowadays, we often hear a group of people lamenting what "the world is in decline, and people's hearts are treacherous." But why is the world declining? And how can people's hearts be treacherous? This is because the current social environment is very bad, and human nature is very flawed. The way to remedy this is to change the environment and refresh the nature, and there is no other strategy. To change the environment, we should fundamentally overthrow the decadent and bad environment in the old society and create a rational and comfortable new environment. The most urgent and important thing is to change the material environment. "Only when clothing and food are sufficient do people know honor and disgrace." It is simply wishful thinking for a person to not be able to　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　live and work in peace and contentment and live a good life. Moreover, the material environment is the underlying foundation of various cultural relics and systems; therefore, changing the material environment is a prerequisite for changing all environments. Because the specific environmental characteristics have not changed, other organizations such as politics, law, religion, and art cannot be changed. As for the refreshing of nature. Education is of course a very powerful tool. The education mentioned here does not only refer to school education: prenatal education, family education, and even social education are also very important. We must not only make every child develop good habits, beautiful thoughts, and noble morals at all times; adults must also set an example and set a good example for them to see. In this way, subtly and gradually, human nature will gradually improve.　　　　　　　　　　　　The method of using strikes, the law can not collect.</p>

<h3>Far Eastern Games and Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has created a so-called puppet Manchuria under its own control, but finally, because it did not get sympathy in the international　community, no one recognized the puppet Manchuria as an independent country. However, they will not give up and can do any despicable and dirty thing, and they are doing everything possible to carry out activities in the international community.　　This time, the Far Eastern Games will be held in the Philippines, and Japan has another opportunity. They are determined to win over the puppet Manchuria to join the Far Eastern Games. Those with discerning eyes do not need to explain in detail. If they are allowed to join, although China does not formally recognize the puppet country, in fact, the Far Eastern Games have actually recognized the puppet Manchuria. Their purpose is nothing more than to use the opportunity of sports to carry out political aggression and lure people to take the bait. Therefore, first they asked to formally join, and then they asked to participate individually. Their cunning and insidious means are as clear as a candle. After hitting the nail several times, they have not given up. To this day, they have come up with the ghost show of what the round table conference is.</p>
<p>According to the rules of the Far Eastern Games, the admission of new members must be approved by all member countries. If one member country opposes it, it will not be allowed to join. Then, as long as China opposes it, it can refuse to join. The reason for the opposition is that the puppet continent is not a formal country. The part of the land seized by imperialism through aggressive behavior, the aggressed people will never recognize their own land as an independent country, so they absolutely refuse it. It is a legitimate and very grand thing.</p>
<p>To take it a step further, if Japan insists on not respecting justice in the face of China's resolute opposition and insists on pulling the puppet Manchuria to join, then China can withdraw from the Far Eastern Games. The solution to the incident is very simple. I don't know why the general sports authorities have to cooperate hypocritically and waste their words. We must know that sacrificing sports is a small matter, and sacrificing the country is a big matter. Therefore, in our hope, when the round table conference is held in Shanghai, the representatives attending only need to argue based on this point.</p>
<p>In short, if there are representatives of the puppet country in the Far Eastern Games, even if the participating countries do not recognize the puppet country, they will actually recognize it. Therefore, Japan is sparing no effort this time and is desperately trying to win over the puppet Manchuria to join. Which Chinese does not know their tricks? Therefore, before the opening of the Far Eastern Games, when the so-called round table conference is held in Shanghai, the Chinese representatives should not allow the representatives of the puppet country to join under any circumstances.</p>
<h3>Unsurprising Events</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>For the sake of rushing through life, it had been a long time since I met with Man. I don't know why, but recently, my heart has always held a layer of hidden worry, as if something unfortunate might have happened to Man.</p>
<p>In reality, Man had a unique personality, but also a narrow mind; when a certain event occurred, if it didn't suit his personality, or even completely violated it, he couldn't remain silent and would criticize and blame, even though he clearly understood that, in comparison, he was but a drop of tear to a clear pool.</p>
<p>The result, of course, was that he wouldn't benefit from it. At most, besides getting some mocking faces and perfunctory warm gestures, all that remained was a terrible shadow following him, swaying.</p>
<p>However, he never felt this, because he deeply believed in everything he did. When he couldn't escape from his troubled feelings, he would often think, "It would be better to die and be done with it!"</p>
<p>At this point, he lost his job, and half a year passed in the blink of an eye. But, but, he was, after all, a "person," and he couldn't live without a livelihood just because of his personality!</p>
<p>Poor and distressed, he had even considered "death" as a last resort.</p>
<p>But few of his friends had him in mind. No, some did, but only when a similar incident occurred:</p>
<p>-- Remember the last time? Man made quite a splash!</p>
<p>Unless something like that happened, his image rarely crossed people's minds.</p>
<p>On a drizzly evening, I finally set off on the road to his house. On the way, I worried that his pursuit of "life" would keep us from meeting.</p>
<p>Ascending the stairs, this imagination didn't diminish, until I stood at the door and saw that it wasn't locked.</p>
<p>Pushing open the door, a sickening odor rushed out, even though the window was open. Man lay quietly on his small tin bed, deep in thought, his free-cloth robe even dirtier. Indeed, his face was exceptionally sallow, filled with an urgent, heavy, and sorrowful expression.</p>
<p>Words were exchanged in mutual inquiry, but his sorrow never lessened.</p>
<p>"…The rent is the most annoying," he said, "They've come three times, and I put them off for another week. What can I do? Eating is still a problem, and where can I find..." He sighed deeply.</p>
<p>The door creaked again, and a woman's head poked in. Her face was covered in strange powder, with lines of flesh crisscrossing it, and her eyes, especially, shot out frightening, thieving glints.</p>
<p>-- Look, she heard someone talking, so she deliberately came up to take a look. Really... Alas!</p>
<p>When I came out, a kind of gloomy shadow enveloped my heart.</p>
<p>Time kept running, one day, two days... I don't know why, but these past few days, my heart has been throbbing like that, throbbing. And, sometimes, I can't help but think: "I wonder how Man is doing; I hope nothing unfortunate has happened?" I wanted to go, but I was always tied down by trivial matters.</p>
<p>On the eighth day, a letter arrived, the handwriting so潦草, yet, in any case, I could tell it was written by Man. Opening it, there were only a few words— … Driven by life, I have no choice but to resort to this last measure. The rivers and lakes have no lid; one can find a burial place anywhere. Please tell my friends not to dwell on me...</p>
<p>In a panic, I ran to his apartment. The bed was gone, and papers were scattered messily everywhere.</p>
<p>- Did he really try to commit suicide? This... this probably won't happen! But who…? The factual scene and the negative ideal were constantly fighting and debating. I asked the landlord, and the answer I got was still a very vague and ambiguous one.</p>
<p>We split up and searched, searched. In the end, there was no news at all.</p>
<p>- He must have ended up in the fish's belly. In this place, with little help from relatives and friends, the heavy pressure of life made it impossible for him to resist. There's no need to doubt it. He must be drifting away with the turbulent waves! Together, we thought, sighing.</p>
<p>Death is something that no one can escape. It is a necessary stage in life, though the circumstances may differ. This is nothing to be surprised about; it is extremely ordinary. Man is just an ordinary</p>
<p>grain in the bottom of the pile!</p>
<p>Thug Huang San walked into Xiao En's house: fiercely clenching his fist, he struck directly at Xiao. Xiao En hurriedly clasped his hands and begged for mercy.</p>

<h3>Random Talks of Siam (Seven) Gecko and Four-legged Snake</h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>Siam is a tropical country, so there are naturally a lot of reptiles, especially geckos, which are commonplace. Not to mention in those humid places, even in very elegant Western-style houses, the walls are covered with geckos. They are not afraid of people. Sometimes two geckos fight on the ceiling, lose their footing and fall on your head, but they are still not afraid and continue to fight in your hair. When you are eating, they will climb onto the table and squeak to beg for food. If you are not willing to give them a few grains of rice, they will not leave. Speaking of four-legged snakes, they are really scary. These things usually hide in crevices. Every night, when everything is quiet, they make strange noises like big toads croaking. They have a certain hobby, which is to like sleeping in people's quilts. Sometimes when you get up in the morning, you see it lying on your shoulder, its two rat eyes staring at you. I have been visited by it three times, and I still feel a little nervous when I think about it.</p>
<p>Overview of Six Chinese Communities Abroad</p>
<p>Due to historical and geographical reasons between China and Siam, there are more Chinese living in Siam than in other places. According to reliable surveys, there are at least three million. Siam's population is said to be twelve million, but this number is not very accurate. In reality, it is at most eight or nine million, and those with Chinese ancestry account for more than half. Therefore, the fact that Siam is a world of Chinese is undeniable.</p>
<p>Speaking of the businesses of overseas Chinese, the scope is also very broad. Siam's main products of rice and timber, as well as industries such as cigarettes, sugar production, and matches, and all kinds of shops, large and small, are almost entirely operated by our compatriots. There are also quite a few who are engaged in farming or fishing in the interior. On the surface, it seems that overseas Chinese are manipulating Siam's economy, but in reality, the prosperity of Siam today is still due to the efforts of our compatriots.</p>
<p>If we divide it by region, the most numerous of our compatriots are from Chaozhou, followed by those from Guangzhou and Qiongzhou, and then the Hakka people from Meixian and the Fujianese. The fewest are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The above-mentioned six groups each have a guild hall. These are the oldest overseas Chinese organizations. As for the various industry associations, they are new organizations that have only emerged in recent years. The organization that oversees all overseas Chinese is the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce was originally a commercial group, but the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Siam is equivalent to an embassy. Because there is no commercial treaty between China and Siam, there is naturally no diplomatic mission, so all overseas Chinese affairs are handled by the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, we can imagine how high the status of the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce is. Because of this, the leaders of each region compete fiercely for this position, and coupled with commercial competition, it has formed a situation of division among the regions. The ancients said that people insult themselves before others insult them, and this saying is never wrong. In recent years, the Siamese government's various oppressions of the Chinese are partly due to someone directing it behind the scenes (such as when the League of Nations rejected a certain country's invasion of China last time, Siam was the only one of the forty-three countries present whose representative did not vote, which is a clear proof of this), but the inability of our compatriots to unite is still a major reason.</p>

<h3>Review of "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Written by Matsui Hisao, translated by Xun Zhi</p>
<p>The depiction in this film is not merely for the sake of sensationalism; in the midst of this depiction, it effectively portrays the psychology of strong justice suppressing hatred.</p>
<p>This is a vivid record of the original author, Robert E. Burns, actually experiencing hardship and struggle. To this day, Burns is still being pursued and wandering in various places. However, whenever there is an opportunity, he still bravely exposes the darkness of this "chain gang." Therefore, there is no sensationalism in the original work. He recorded his experiences in blood simply to make the general audience clearly aware of the existence of prisons as anachronistic institutions and to stir up a public opinion of resistance.</p>
<p>Based on this original work, director Mervyn LeRoy experienced Burns' experiences and used the same strong justice to depict this work. Therefore, even though there may be shortcomings in some of the techniques, the overall depiction of the protagonist and the living conditions of the "chain gang" is truly excellent. The scene where the protagonist prepares to escape and asks a black man to use a hammer to break the lock, and the tragic scene of escaping in the forest swamp—these are all desperate struggles that cross the line of death and entrust everything to human instinct, and they are all excellent depictions that pulsate with human instinct.</p>
<p>However, Putnam's Film Says: "In this movie, unlike Hell's Highway (directed by Rowland Brown), it does not suggest 'why the state should allow this inhumane, medieval prison system to exist.'"</p>
<p>"If we could mix the better elements of these two films, then we might get a complete film about Chaingang." In other words, the exposure in this film, unfortunately, stops just short of a hair's breadth. Of course, as mentioned above, exposing the "chain gang," even to this extent, already has considerable significance. In particular, this film shows that the controllers of this system are a part of the state, the state government, which is the spokesperson of the state. For this point, the achievements of this exposure cannot but be said to be very great.</p>
<p>Truly, this film is a thorough exposure. Through this work, we experienced Burns' painful experiences and were dominated by strong feelings of hatred.</p>
<p>However, since this film is a work of art, we cannot but say that its effect beyond the role that an exposure work should have—that is, its development and determination for the future—is still very weak. After watching this film, can we not be inspired to vigorously arouse a unified, organized consciousness and emotion, like reading Kobayashi Takiji's "Kanikosen (The Crab Cannery Ship)"? Unfortunately, the answer is no.</p>
<p>What we have here are all kinds of terror and mixed anger and explosions. After this anger and explosion, the attitude of how to deal with it is expressed very ambiguously here.</p>
<p>We don't know what Hell's Highway is like, but even if it is exposing inhumane prisons, as long as it is fundamentally an American film, a commodity, then there is not much to expect. However, under the current state of the film industry in the United States, when those low-level so-called Gangster movies are still appearing one after another, being able to produce this kind of terrible exposure work is already something that has to be said to be a major event worth writing about in the history of American cinema.</p>
<h3>Film Review: "Going Hollywood"</h3>
<p>— Cang Sang</p>
<p>“Going Hollywood” Da Guangming Hollywood! Hollywood! In the golden world of America, it forms a mysterious corner in itself: in the yearning of ordinary men and women, it seems to be such an enviable place! Here, there are beautiful women like clouds, jazz songs that sweep the world, and romances that change like the morning and evening—everything so-called music, life, and love seems to be readily available. However, in reality, do the men and women living in Hollywood truly enjoy human happiness? This "Going Hollywood," which depicts Hollywood life, reveals the truth.</p>
<p>Since the global economic depression has spread to this decadent and extravagant Hollywood, the male and female movie stars concentrated in the United States have scattered like birds and beasts, and Hollywood is in danger of total collapse. The original name of this "Going Hollywood" is "Going Hollywood." If we examine the meaning of the name and review the content of the film, we can see that the American film industry is trying its best to find ways to boost morale and revive Hollywood. As for the result, the answer indicated in this film is still a question mark.</p>
<p>The strengths and weaknesses of Hollywood can be seen in this film. In terms of content, it is as empty and far-fetched as other general song and dance films. For example, the love story narrated in it is so unnatural that it does not make people feel any emotion at all. This may be the truth of Hollywood romances. In terms of technology, it can indeed express the advantages of American material civilization. Therefore, the director's techniques, the flexibility and ingenuity of the camera shots, and the clarity of the sound all show the characteristics of Hollywood.</p>
<p>Marion Davies plays a female teacher who yearns for music, life, and love, and her performance shows strengths and weaknesses. The opening scenes of the film are not very lively, and her performance as a female teacher is mediocre. After she arrives in Hollywood, she changes from being rigid to being clever and lively. Perhaps frivolous song and dance movements are her forte, resulting in completely different achievements before and after. Bing Crosby's singing is still very pleasant, but his movements are influenced by the vulgar environment of Hollywood. Therefore, although he tries his best to act like a great artist, he is far inferior to Jack Buchanan in "Parisian Pierrot" or Volpe in "Roman Scandals." This once again proves that the difference between American Jazzy songs and European Classical songs cannot be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>The magnificent and luxurious background of this film is also what should be written about when describing Hollywood life. When Marion Davies is about to enter Hollywood, she lies on the bed and imagines the romantic scenes of her being with the singer she secretly loves, which are extremely beautiful. However, all these dreamlike scenes reflect the emptiness of Hollywood. The word "emptiness" has been repeatedly mentioned by the characters in the play, which may be the answer to Hollywood's revival?</p>
<h3>Review of "Child of Manhattan" - Nanjing Screening</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>There are progressive writers, and there are also decadent writers; there are films with "serious consciousness" (?), heroic, and exposing films, and there are also deceptive films that anesthetize and praise the rulers. Before this social system is completely transformed, all this complex and contradictory is inevitable.</p>
<p>The original author of "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," Robert E. Burns, personally tasted the poisonous deception tactics of the rulers towards the slaves. He personally experienced the darkness and cruelty of this real society. Finally, he revealed the tragic cry of his heart.</p>
<p>And the original author of "Child of Manhattan," Preston Sturges, never has the courage to open his eyes to look at reality. He always closes his eyes to "praise the merits and virtues" of the upper class. Don't believe it, let's see what he tells us? "Our" rich man, Paul, recognized a dancer in a dance hall on his property because he was inspecting his property. The dancer naturally moved the heart of our rich man because of her beautiful appearance and outstanding dance skills. Therefore, Paul was "deeply in love" and the woman was also moved by his heart. Relying on his wealth, he finally lived with her. However, because the plot was too simple, our writer came up with a twist. After her child died, she mistakenly thought that his love was only for the sake of the child, so she left without saying goodbye and divorced him in Mexico. However, our rich man, Paul, although he told her not to publicize it when he secretly married her, fearing that it would affect his family's reputation, he truly loved her. So, after he discovered her, her former lover also volunteered to sacrifice everything. So, our rich man and our dancer "rekindle old dreams."</p>
<p>Look! Our rich man is so gentle and affectionate!</p>
<p>Praising the rulers, covering up and explaining for the upper class, and deceiving the audience, this is the true nature of decadent writers.</p>
<p>However, the iron-like facts are in front of us. How many rich people use money to play with women, destroy women, and discard them after they are done? This is a common phenomenon in the real society, even if the screenwriter of "The Match King" has never and cannot cover up this fact.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Child of Manhattan," in addition to telling us a mediocre, cliché, empty love story, has also fulfilled the task of deceiving the audience for our rich man.</p>
<p>Of course, like other American love story films, the performance of "Child of Manhattan" is brisk, concise, and smooth. Nancy Carroll and John Bowers are the best performers, especially in several scenes in the dance hall.</p>
<h3>The Four Sisters in "Little Women" will soon be shown at the Grand Shanghai.</h3>
<h3>About the Unprecedented Miracle on the Screen of "Little Women"</h3>
<p>— Bai Zu</p>
<p>"Little Women" is a story about a passionate and intricate family in the nineteenth century. What we see in it is a tranquil and faithful view of life, a softly suggestive view of love, sincere and passionate ethics, and sincere and simple friendship. People who are used to living a heated life will undoubtedly feel a kind of intimate and meaningful chewiness. This flavor is not only蕴蓄 in the novel, but also believed to be possible to be retained in the "Little Women" movie that will be released soon.</p>
<p>This book was once performed on stage in 1912. The second time, it was performed in London in 1919. However, in 1933, RKO Pictures spent a lot of effort to produce a pure literary film, which has to admire its great courage, engraving deeply the footsteps of giants on the entire path of film advancement. This is truly an unprecedented miracle on the screen.</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn, the star of the film, has a special achievement in "Little Women," fully showing her full understanding and integration of the characters' personalities, and the clever techniques of director George Cukor have given her the opportunity for closer cooperation. So, after she filmed "Little Women," she said: "I studied for a sufficient period of six months for the understanding of the role. When the microphone was shaking on me, I seemed to be the person 'Jo' in the book, her encounters were my encounters, and I was one with her. Even when director Cukor was working, he never once lost his mind, and he also became the person 'Jo' in the book!"</p>
<p>"Little Women" indeed has a very large readership in the world literary world, but it also has the same fate in China. People with considerable literacy in the literary world all know this literary masterpiece "Little Women." There are only two Chinese translations, one called "Little Women" and one called "Four Sisters." Those who have read this translation now have the opportunity for reference, and we can see the activities of "Little Women" on the cinema screen.</p>
<p>In the lonely silver screen, "Little Women" is enough to attract our attention</p>
<p>and joy!</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>The Sword and Shadow Record (Nana) (3)</h3>
<p>— Yin Ming</p>
<p>Since Nana's first performance, the applause throughout the venue has become longer and louder day by day. Grand Duke was the first person to give her a trấn石 necklace, but he was not the only one who bought her a diamond necklace. There were also people who sent her precious leather clothes and everything else that pleased her. When Graneau first saw Nana wearing a shiny necklace on her white neck, he felt unbearably jealous, but later, he had no way to stop it and even tried his best to win her favor. In order to give her a comfortable place to relax, he specially bought a villa in the countryside for Nana to live in. From then on, she accepted everything Graneau gave her without question or thanks. And she gave him what Graneau asked for without any hesitation. The friendship between the two of them was extremely ordinary, extremely natural and without any problems, but he and she never touched on love, and she never gave him any promises, although she knew that he loved her deeply and was madly jealous for her.</p>
<p>Graneau would never have bought that villa in the countryside if he had known that next to him was the garden of Colonel André Muffat, and that the young military officer George Muffat, now on leave at home, was living in his brother's country home. Since George and Nana discovered that they were neighbors, they had been meeting secretly from time to time. The most ridiculous and pitiful thing was old Graneau. In order to keep Nana away from the many men in Paris—the first of whom was the senile Grand Duke, and several of Nana's old handkerchief friends—people like 　丁 and Mimi, but he did not expect that it would instead create the opportunity for her and an even more difficult rival, the young officer, to gather together, while 　丁 and Mimi were still living with her. However, when Graneau occasionally came to the countryside, Zoe hid them, so Graneau never found out that 　丁 and Mimi were living in his villa. This was the happiest period of Nana's life. She and George met every day, either chatting intimately indoors or walking hand in hand outdoors, the two of them always inseparable. Nana's innocent and naive personality had made George worship her wholeheartedly. (To be continued)</p>
