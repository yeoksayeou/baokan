<h3>嚴防霍亂</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>今夏氣候酷熱。長江流域及豫魯諸省。久旱不雨。疫癘傳播。危險滋多。卽如霍亂一症。向爲我國夏季之流行病。而其激烈流行之循環性。則並無規則可尋。故時當夏令。預防之舉。萬不可緩。絕不能以去年鮮有眞性霍亂爲藉口。而鬆其防禦也。</p>
<p>去今不過三年前我國霍亂之流行區域。共有二十省巿。患者十萬人。死亡三萬以上。其爲禍之烈。可以想見。去年倖免眞性霍亂之爆發。或僅因其處於發現輪次之消極潛伏狀態。如謂今年必不至於出現。則未免過於樂觀。據上海防止霍亂臨時事務所首次公告。在本年「五月六月內所取河塘水樣中。有三次發現呈微弱凝集性之霍亂弧菌。此點對於霍亂流行之研究。頗關重要。」而報載徐州方面。虎疫盛行。日有倒斃。棺材店舖。竟至供不應求。如不迅加撲滅。轉而傳播他處。後患重重。何堪設想。</p>
<p>據專家意見。大槪霍亂之流行。分爲兩種方式。一爲爆發的。因飲料染有病菌而發生。一爲遷延的。由蚊蠅等接觸病菌而傳染。吾人幸而處於通都大邑。有自來水供飲料。防疫注射爲保護。受疫機會。自不若窮鄕辟壤之多。反之若內地之貧苦小民。類多蟄居於蓬舍草棚中。蚊蠅麕集。相與爲伍。而所飲之水。復多取諸井河池塘。傳染旣易。中疫自多。而况本年天時亢旱。河井淺淤。水質混濁。以常情推測。霍亂病菌之滋長。當猶速於平時。是以預防之舉更不可緩。　　又有進者。民國二十年長江及淮河運河各流域。洪水泛濫散發性之霍亂。曾見於當年之秋季。繼續延長至於次年之春初。幸以救濟水災委員會預防得法。爲禍差减。今年冀東鄂北一帶。河水大漲。危險萬狀。陸沉之慘。殆難避免。照吾人經騐。水災之後。必有疫癘。其因疫癘而死者。往往較淹餓而死者爲衆。將來災區之霍亂至堪焦慮。甚望負水利及公共衛生之資者。及早籌謀。毌使滋蔓。至於西北各省。地方遼闊。交通梗阻。每逢亢旱。疫癘叢生。人民死亡。牲畜損失。爲數不貲。當二十一年霍亂大流行期間。陜晋川綏諸省均由北平上海用飛機運送大批疫苗。以供預防聞今年四月間中央衛生署曾擬更進一步設立西北防疫處。以便就近辦理血淸疫苗等工作。今夏天時之旱。向所罕見。西北防疫處之需要。更爲迫切。自不待言。</p>
<p>年來我國之公共衛生事業。雖不能媲美列强。要亦有所進步。卽如本埠巿衛生局及海港檢疫管理處等機關。對於防疫工作。頗稱認眞。可爲例證。惟內地各省之衛生行政。尙屬幼稚。而貪苦小民。對於防止霍亂等時疫方法。亦大抵茫無頭緒。是則端賴中央及各地衛生行政人員。及社會先進人士。深入民間。努力工作而已。吾人皆知預防霍亂。不可不注意於淸潔防疫之宣傳。疫苗注射之實施。消毒運動之推廣。隔離醫院之設立。然若僅以通都大邑或上流社會爲限。則殊不足以言普遍。而公共衛生之精義亦失。故眞正之公共衛生事業。必以下層民衆爲主要之對象。通俗方法求廣泛之推進。霍亂本爲最危險流行病之一。言其預防之道。固不可不由箇中求之也。</p>

<h3>汪精衛昨晨蒞滬即晚返京　延醫診治宿疾　發表書面談話</h3>
<p>行政院長汪精衛、於昨晨七時、偕同鐵道部次長曾仲鳴、由京抵滬、延德醫諾爾診治宿疾、卽晚十一時乘夜車返京、汪氏於昨日下午六時、對上星期三中政會議關於監察院彈劾案决議、及胡漢民出洋問題、發表書面談話、有所申述、茲分錄各情如次、</p>
<h3>昨晨抵滬延醫診治</h3>
<p>行政院長汪精衛所患之糖尿症、迄已數年、不時由京抽暇來滬、延醫療治、茲復於昨晨七時、偕同鐵道部次長曾仲鳴、由京乘夜車來滬、當在南翔車站下車、卽換乘自備汽車逕返西蒲石路私邸休息、旋於八時許、電邀諾爾醫生前往檢視宿疾、約一小時始辭、據其左右稱、汪氏此來、仍爲療治糖尿症宿疾、別無其他任務、擬卽晚夜車返京云云、</p>
<h3>中政會議常委提案</h3>
<p>汪氏昨日下午發表書面談話、其原文如下、（記者問）上星期三中政會議關於監察院彈劾案有决議三條、其理由如何、可得聞否、（汪氏答）此爲中央常務委員五人、居正·葉楚傖·蔣中正·陳果夫·汪兆銘·之提案、經會議議决通過者、本來所謂五權分立、並非個個分立、不相聯繫、此理爲稍治憲法學者所同解、建國大綱規定在憲政開始時期、五院院長由總統任命督率之、可見五權雖然分立、仍然有個系統、現行國民政府組織法規定國民政府主席、不負實際政治責任、而於第十五條規定憲法未頒佈以前、五院院長各自對中國國民黨中央執行委員會負其責任、可見得五權雖然分立、也仍然有個系統、所謂中央執行委員會、除全體會議半年一次外、平時機關、處决黨務的、有中央執行委員會常務會議、處理政治的、有中央執行委員會政治會議、皆於每星期開會一次、現在除考試院院長戴季陶先生外、立法院院長孫哲生先生、司法院院長居覺生先生、監察院院長于右任先生、及兄弟、皆是中央常務會議及中政會議的常務委員、對於五院的事、一方面各自對中央執行委員會負其責任、一方面於中央執行委員會中謀其溝通聯絡、所以關於五院重大的事、無一不須提出中政會議通過、我們只須看看每次中政會議所討論通過的、多是行政院及立法院的提議、便可瞭然、然則此次中政會議對於監察院事加以指導監督、正如對於立法院行政的事加以指導監督一樣、外間有人以此次决議、爲有妨害於監察權之獨立、這種批評是絕對錯誤的、</p>
<h3>監察院彈劾案成立</h3>
<p>監察院彈劾案之成立、係始於委員一人之提議、而終於委員三人之審查、由此可知所謂彈劾案之成立、僅係彈劾方面之意思、而被彈劾者之意思、尙無表示、懲戒機關之意思、更尙無表示、一般人認爲彈劾案成立、便是被彈劾者罪名成立、這是絕對的誤解、彈劾案成立之後、由監察院院長移付懲戒機關、如果是一般公務員、則懲戒機關爲司法院所組織之公務員懲戒委員會、如果是政務官、則懲戒機關爲國民政府所組織之政務官懲戒委員會、這是現行的制度、照此制度、懲戒機關、於接到監察院彈劾案之後、於一定期間通知被彈劾的人、俾其申辯、接到被彈劾人的申辯書之後、開會審查、兩次三次不等、審查結果、或判斷爲當付懲戒、或判斷爲不付懲戒、做個比方、監察院猶如普通刑事的檢察官一樣懲戒委員會猶如裁判官一樣、如果以彈劾案成立、爲被彈劾人罪名成立、猶如以檢察官的說話爲被彈劾人的罪狀、而不必再加以審判、是一樣的糊塗、</p>
<h3>未付懲戒不宜宣示</h3>
<p>以上是將現行制度約略說明、以下便入於中政會議議决的由來、本來監察院彈劾法、一切彈劾案在未移付懲戒機關以前、不得宣示其內容、於是許多監察委員便行移付懲戒機關以後、將內容任意對外宣示、甚至將彈劾案全文在報紙公佈、須知此彈劾案僅僅移付懲戒機關、尙未由懲戒機關通知被彈劾人俾其申辯、更說不到懲戒機關的審查、如果此時將彈劾案全文公佈、豈不是只有彈劾方面的意見、而沒有被彈劾者的意見、以及懲戒機關的意見嗎、這算得做公平嗎、須知國家立法、獎善懲惡、兩者並重、例如懲治貪污、當與保障廉潔並重、懲治失職違法者、當與保障盡職守法者並重、社會輿論、亦當如此、每逢見一彈劾案、不可卽以懲治有罪爲快心之具、同時尤當注意於保障無辜、不然、國家社會有何方法以勉人爲善呢、譬如一個小小的公務員、被監察院一位委員彈劾、三位委員審查之後、指爲貪污、於移付懲戒機關之時、並對外宣洩、則凡閱報者皆將認其爲貧污了、這一個公務員受了這種貪污的罪名、如果情眞罪確、猶可說也、如果負屈含冤、那怎麽樣呢、在懲戒機關未通知以前、是無從申辯的、這是何等的冤屈、卽使接到懲戒機關的通知、上了申辯書、而這一個小小的公務員、有何能力能使此申辯書與彈劾案同樣宣傳於報紙、那末這一個公務員、本來是於懲戒機關判斷之後、其罪名始成立、如今則於彈劾案宣佈之時、其罪名已經在報紙上成爲衆見衆聞的了、這是何等的不公平呢、以上是一個公務員負屈含冤的時候、至於政務官呢、更不同了、本來政務官是負政治上之責任的、所以懲戒法上對於政務官沒有什麽記過、減俸、降級等等處分、只有輕則申誡、重則免職、申誡不必論、做到政務官如果政策不行便當引退、用不着什麽懲戒、而監察委員之彈劾政務官、其所發生之影響、不僅僅在政務官之本人、而在於所執行之政策這種政策、有時當守秘密、不能公開討論的、須知此非爲政務官本人之禍福而守秘密、乃政務官爲國家之利害、而守秘密、所以要這一個政務官爲與監察院彈劾案做相當之對抗而在報紙上互相發表、這在負有政治責任的政務官、是不能如此的、關於國防外交的、固不用說、卽其他各部會、在國家政策之必要上、有時亦須秘密、如此說來、只許監察院宣佈彈劾案、而不許被彈劾人宣佈申辯書、是最不公平的、兩相宣布似乎比較公平了、而在公務員則有無力宣布之苦、在政務官則有不能宣布之苦、</p>
<h3>胡氏出洋宣傳政策</h3>
<p>（問）外傳胡展堂先生有出洋之意、未知確否、（答）胡展堂先生確曾託人示意、欲往歐美一行、爲中央宣傳政策、中央同人對此欣然同意、惟因胡先生數年以來、皆遠在香港、於中央一切政策、必有許多不盡明瞭之處、甚望胡先生於出游之前、能來南京一行、如不願來南京、至少來上海一行、以便詳細討論、現正在以此提議、徵求胡先生同意、尙未得復、至於孫哲生先生或孔庸之先生將來是否可往香港一行、現尙未决、因孫先生在檀香山避暑期中、而孔先生又新由華北歸來、各事待理、一時或走不開也、</p>

<h3>美貸棉改訂合同後　今日首批到滬　共二萬八百餘件　卸在招商局華棧</h3>
<p>我國向美購買之借欵棉花、自改正合同後、卽將一千萬元美金大批棉花、自六月分起、從北美趕裝來華、第一次係由美商福來洋行代租巨輪、芬雷那號Fernlane、在北美新亞聯港裝載滿船棉、共計二萬零八百零九包、占一萬餘噸、預定七月十五日到上海、旋因在途中遇有風霧、航行稍爲延阻、較原定進口期、須遲到兩天、昨日午到、接該輪無綫電、謂今日午刻、准可駛進吳淞、福來洋行已經雇定領港、備帶引到滬、一面知照招商局準備堆儲、該局原擬將該貨存諸揚子碼頭棧房中、嗣因全部棉將接踵運來、總額有二十餘萬件、揚子碼頭一處、不勝容積、且修理工事、尙未完畢、故將本日運到之第一船貨改儲在浦東華棧、昨日已經碼頭管理處、通知該棧、準備一切起卸手續矣、至其餘各輪所載之棉、亦將在此短時期中、趕運來滬、以後每月將有四五萬件、裝抵上海、又聞因罷工、而阻住在美之麥子船三艘、今亦已由美開出、在此一週內可望到滬、</p>

<h3>各區救火會防旱工作　驅帮浦車十輛　出發鄕區抽水　計分九區進行</h3>
<p>國民社云、本巿巿政府、以巿內各鄕區、因天氣亢旱、災象將成、業經該府召集第二百六十四次會議、决撥六萬元購置大批抽水機、分發各鄕區應用、完全由社會·土地·公安局·等負責辦理、惟以抽水機一時不及趕辦、特經巿公安局長文鴻恩、飭該局第二科消防股主任董致和、着本巿各區救火會派救火帮浦車十輛、前往各鄕區抽水、共分九區進行、（一）「龍華區」、由滬南北區兩救火會負責、（二）「彭浦區」經閘北第三段救火會辦理、（三）「閘北區」歸閘北第四段救火會負責、（四）「漕涇區」由滬南及西區等救火會辦理、（五）「蒲松區」經滬西曹家渡與南巿董家渡救火會、會進行、（六）「引翔區」歸閘北第一段救火會負責、（七）「殷行區」由閘北第二段救火會負責、（八）「江灣區」經江灣救火會辦理、㈨「眞茹區」由眞茹鎭救火會負責辦理、於昨晨九時、由該局董主任至凝和路也是園、與旱災救濟委員會接洽、會同各鄕區代表辦理、故各區救火會、已於昨日上午十時起、分別出發進行、</p>

<h3>米價因天旱阻運步漲　巿府令飭制止　內地存底豐富　洋商採辦洋米</h3>
<p>中央社云、邇來天久未雨、旱象已成、本巿政府、除撥欵救旱外、對於巿塲米價暴漲一層、殊以爲影響民食非鮮、爰特令飭巿社會局云、查本巿邇因天時亢旱、米價暴漲、未及半月、竟每石遞漲至三元有餘、設再繼續增高、自足影響民食、本府前准浙江省政府電請限制米價、當經令飭該局遵辦在案、合再令仰該局卽便遵照、迅速妥爲制止、無任乘機暴漲、以維民食、而安人心、并仰將辦理情形具報、切切此令、茲悉巿社會局業已奉令、轉告各米商、限制米價、以維民食云、</p>
<p>新聲社云、據經售米糧公會會長蔣石稚稱、滬巿糧食、向由無錫·常熟·蘇州·嘉興·松江·嘉善·靑浦·江陰·常州·宜興·溧陽·等各地所供給、因三年來各地均能豐收、故內地存穀、較往年爲多、據廢歷端陽所得統計、上列各地存穀總數、粳稻六十餘萬石、秈稻三十餘萬石、糯稻二十餘萬石、總計達一百二十萬石、至現在止、總存數尙在七十萬石以上、依照約計、此數足資維持新米上巿、</p>
<h3>到貨减少</h3>
<p>平時各地、每日運米來滬者、南北巿總計達七十號、（每船一號可裝米百石、至二百石、平均約一萬二千石）比以天時久旱未雨、田地龜裂、而江陰·常州·宜興·溧陽·等地、河水涸阻、致運米船已告絕跡、蘇常等地米船亦銳减、平均南北巿每日僅到三十號、但滬巿存米、則尙可維持一二旬、</p>
<h3>價漲原因</h3>
<p>蔣氏又稱、至於米價步漲之原因、（一）內地小河無水、四鄕糧食不能運往鎭巿、（二）設有儲米而欲出售者、同村人加以阻止、以防旱荒、（三）本埠米商、日來有赴內地買大批糧食者、成交已達數萬石、（四）人心不鎭定、故多積米待荒、（五）存米商居奇不售、（六）投機者抬價收買、（七）天旱不雨、農民大率專心灌漑田地、作壩以儲水、米船爲阻、因此複雜之緣故、造成空前之恐慌、</p>
<h3>獲利甚鉅</h3>
<p>新聲社記者又向運米商調查、謂內地存米確屬尙多、因多數船戶、正在插秧及灌水、致米船少到、平時由內地動米來滬、每石除開支外、可得利二角至三角、多至五角、已屬大好生意、現因人心不鎭靜、及一部份人之操縱、每米一石、有得利三四元者、四元餘一担之穀價、以五折破礱、加伙食開銷薪工利息、而售十三元、故一般運米商、莫不利巿三倍、喜形於色、</p>
<h3>民食前途</h3>
<p>又據另一方面消息、米業爲防荒起見有訂購洋米五十萬石之議、然反觀二十年水災時、因訂購洋米、造成國米之慘跌、設此次再有此舉、將來國產貨將亦蒙受莫大影響、今年江北糧食大熟、湖南亦然、江西方面、豐歉相等、故以國內米糧足資維持各地之民食、决不致生恐慌、訂購洋米、殊屬多此一舉云云、</p>
<h3>外商要求</h3>
<p>申時社云、本巿經營進出口糧食洋商·如達孚·安利·祥茂·公平·泰豐·新豐·祥利·等、鑒於我國旱災日重、米價高漲、顯見國內糧食缺乏、本可裝運進口銷售、但以關稅限制、每百公斤須徵一·六五金單位、仍覺負担過重、推銷不易、特派代表赴京、向我外交部要求减半徵稅、外交部據情呈請行政院、並與財實兩部會商結果、覺此事關係國策、未便率爾變更、卽有免稅進口之必要時亦應由行政院統盤籌劃、在某一數量範圍內、特許進口、不能由洋商藉此貿利、因而洋商此項要求、未有若何結果、</p>
<h3>訂購千噸</h3>
<p>各洋商以此次要求雖未達目的、但以近日米價高漲不已、與國外比較、雖照納關稅、仍覺有利、現達孚洋行、已電西貢訂購一千噸來華、由豆巿街各大米行全部認銷、以每担十元一角成交、不日可以到滬、豆米業並將有五十萬担免稅洋米進口、本埠米價、以有洋米爲後盾、此後可望穩定、不致再行狂漲、</p>

<p>目錄一書報介紹</p>

<p>介紹新語林今年是幽默小品文之年，論語，人問世以下，以幽默小品相標榜的刊物，不下數十種，不能說是不好的現象，但其內容，不是裝起紳士面孔，便是流於低級趣味，求能眞正負起幽默小品文的任務，成爲大衆讀物的，幾乎沒有，於是有人根本否認小品文在目前中國文壇上的存在，雖然這是一種誤解，但要解釋這誤解，只有把小品文從談狐說鬼那面糾正過來。</p>
<p>徐懋庸先生主編的新語林，似乎是有這一面上的趨勢，展開第一期杜德璣先生的隔膜，它的那種深切諷刺味道那種不露形跡筆觸，實在使人讀了哭笑不得，尤其在那言之有物一點上，它暴露了現實，同時敎育了那些落後的份子，實非現在流行的所謂幽默小品所能及。此外如風子的文章，也可以一讀。當然，這刊物，也還有許多「閒談」之類的東西，如陳子展先生的兩篇序，發表在這裏，實在不大適宜，然在目前的幽默小品文刊物中，仍不失爲最値得一讀的讀物。我們希望新語林編者以後多登載些隔膜之類的作品，在幽默小品文中開闢一條小路。</p>

<h3>弔劉復先生</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>申報載十四日中央社電：「文學家劉復月前赴平綏路考察方言，因水土不服，抱病回平，至十二日忽劇，重入恊和醫院診治無效，十四日下午二時一刻逝世。據醫院診斷，劉係黃疸症，因病根早伏，乃致不起。學術界同人聞訊，均甚惋惜。」</p>
<p>唉！劉復先生死了嗎！我讀完了這個專電，不覺「悽然者久之」！可要來一個聲明，不曾「悽然下淚」。因爲中國的語言學者又弱一個，爲學術上設想，我們那得不「悽然者久之」！然而我和劉先生從來沒有一面之緣，所以聽到他死了的消息，並不曾顧念舊情，「悽然下淚」！</p>
<p>大約半個月以前罷，大晚報載着綏遠通信，寫的是劉先生和這位記者的長篇談話。劉先生談到了他在五四運動時代爲着「文學革命」奮鬥的舊事，他不甚感慨地說：「現在我沒有勇氣了！」我們正在希望劉先生再能鼓着勇氣，繼續奮鬥，參加大衆語運動。不料劉先生竟一病不起，我們失掉聽取一位語言學專家的意見的一個機會，僅僅就大衆語這個問題而說，這也是一個頂大的損失呵！何况劉先生這次胃暑旅行平綏路沿綫，原是爲了調查方言，只因水土不服，抱病而死，他的那種盡忠於學術的精神，眞可佩服！一個地域的方言雖然不就是大衆語，可是我們要建設大衆語文學，對於國內各處方言的調查研究，以及大衆語中的方言問題的檢討解答，也是一種急需而且重要的工作。像劉先生那樣肯用他的生命之力在方言學上的一位學者，竟無法延長他的生命，他不得不放棄他的最寶貴的工作，這不是目前從事大衆語運動的人，大家都該痛惜的嗎？</p>
<p>前幾天我寫「新詩亂談」兩則，投登中華日報的「動向」，就是因爲看了大晚反綏遠通信所記劉先生的談話纔觸發來的，我本來預定第三則就要談到劉先生用江陰方言寫的瓦釜集，不料手邊沒有這部書，今天還不能寫成。現在就我感觸到的而說，自有新詩以來，出版的詩集怕在百種以上，只有瓦釜集算是全用方言寫詩的第一部，雖然說不到怎樣大的成功，但比那些呌人看不懂的歐化詩，（例如趙景深先生在現代詩選序裏認爲「簡直不通」的象徵派詩）以及堆砌許多古典詞藻的白話詩，瓦釜集自有牠的獨特的價値。我雖不懂江陰方言，然而每一讀瓦釜集裏「車車夜水也風凉」「人比人氣煞人」等詩，就受了很大的感動。他不像劉大白先生一樣，社會主義和勞動問題，可是他的瓦釜集的感人之力是在劉大白先生的賣布謠詩集以上的。可惜他選是不肯俯就（？）一個農民詩人的位置，不曾用他的全副生命之力，充分地把農民苦難的生活，農村悲慘的現實從他的詩歌裏吶喊出來。不過他已經留給我們一個用方言寫新詩的實騐報告，這也是可寶貴的。</p>
<p>記得劉復先生在主持女子學院的時候，布告女生相稱做『姑娘』，不要呌『密絲』，因此此起了許多人的譏刺非難。平心論之，倘若劉先生僅僅反對白話文中不必要的歐化成分，那有什麽不可？劉先生對於歐化太過的白話文，是常常表現不滿的。他在中國文法通論裏說：</p>
<p>我現在只舉一個簡單的例：</p>
<p>子曰：「學而時習之，不亦悅乎？」</p>
<p>這太老式了，不好！</p>
<p>「學而時習之，」子曰，「不亦悅乎？」</p>
<p>這好！</p>
<p>「學而時習之，不亦悅乎？」子曰。</p>
<p>這更好！爲什麽好？歐化了。但「子曰」終沒有能歐化到　　「曰子」！</p>
<p>劉先生嘲笑歐化太過的白話文，截至最近，還是和從前一樣。大晚報綏遠通信，載著他和那位記者談話：</p>
<p>『提倡白話文是爲得使人容易懂得，但是後來弄得比文言還艱深，如歐化得利害，以及無謂的堆砌。』</p>
<p>他（劉先生）對這一點很感慨的說：</p>
<p>『這實在是我們當初所沒有料到的！』</p>
<p>不錯，『歐化得利害』，『無謂的堆砌』，『比文言還艱深』，這眞是目前流行的白話文（尤其是白話詩）的大毛病。假如白話文不是走到了一條這樣的末路，也就會沒有人出來提倡大衆語呵！因此，我們要說劉先生還在世的話，他會有一天參加大衆語運動，至少他會以語言學者的見地，給這種運動一個相當的評價，這個假想是有成立的可能。何况劉先生說他「現在沒有勇氣了」；究竟他還是有很大的勇氣的。</p>
<p>最近他有一篇論文，題目我忘記了，大約是「南無阿彌陀佛」罷，登在南京的民生報，論語半月刊也轉載了。他這篇文章怕要算是他的絕妙的絕筆，發出了他的生命的最後的光輝，這就是以證明他有生命的一日，並不像自古以來許多曲學阿世的名流學者一樣，只是「因屍身難得腐朽，權　於空氣之中」的一條活屍！</p>
<p>我對於劉復先生的死，就在這裏表示一點哀悼的意思。我寫完這篇文章，眞是不覺「悽然者久之」了！</p>
<h3>旱</h3>
<p>— 錫金</p>
<p>千萬顆心渴望着雨水，</p>
<p>焦了，一點嫩苗！</p>
<p>仰望着一輪落日，</p>
<p>暮紅宣示着明天的恐怖。</p>
<p>偶然的凝雲祗是欺騙，</p>
<p>把收穫的希望背在水車盤上。</p>
<p>毛孔中的汗液，不斷地流着，</p>
<p>生命的源泉已經枯竭。</p>
<h3>悼半農</h3>
<p>— 壽同</p>
<p>昨得半農死訊，使我回憶到一年前的叙晤，眞不覺凄然下淚，記得去年亦是這麽一個夏天，半農夫人先回江陰，說半農在濟南研究鐘磬，不久也要回南。果然，三天後我們和半農碰頭了；還承他送兩本薄薄的近著「釋一」和「編鐘」。</p>
<p>某天早上約在壽山公園吃點心，我的小叔經邦是他的學生，所以很有投機的話可談；袁家驊因在江陰岳家也被邀共席。我們談到他弟弟天華的死，又談到他弟弟的身後，或許半農悲愴過甚吧，說了許多消極的話！最後，半農又提到童年無錢讀書的經過，很感慨似的，將他僅有的遺產丨一個區圖（年可收米三十石）捐給孤兒院，作孤兒的敎養費。</p>
<p>席間，記得還有一位無錫國學專修學校的學生季君，向半農發了許多關於國學方面的問題，半儂侃侃而談，一聞而知他近幾年來對於學問，是埋頭苦幹過了。</p>
<p>半農談得最津津有味的，就是他專業的音韵學，本來，研究中國音韵學，是很枯燥的，他却黃汗直流的奔走搜集材料，一到久別的故鄕，便席不暇煖地因忙於工作而走了，四天後，半農從曲阜來信，說天氣很熱，而鐘磬的材料倒弄到不少。我們方欽佩他苦幹的精神，不料，隔了一年的夏天，他的生命，竟在老遠的百靈廟，作他研究的犧牲了。</p>
<p>天華的死我們至今還異常悲痛一般相識的音樂家，更戀戀不忘。可是他的哥哥半農又死了。不論文藝界對他將怎樣論定，我總認爲半農是値得一哭的。</p>
<p>我現在還要想到的，是年約四十開外的半農夫人和兩個孩子以及天華的一家。區圖是捐掉的了。以後的日子，如何能在五間大的住宅裏生活呢？</p>
<h3>談馬來都巿（續）</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>柔佛</p>
<p>柔佛（Jahose），以風流天子的柔佛王著名世界。</p>
<p>柔佛鐵橋在南洋是很有名的。橋道廣闊，長而堅固，有電力控制啟閉機關，使船隻在某一規定的時間能從鐵閘的開放里通過。</p>
<p>柔佛王府建於一個小山的頂上。圍以竹籬，扯上月形旗。俯瞰柔佛鐵橋上車馬往來：汽車成串地條蟲爬，而火車有如蛇在地上蠕展。新加坡與柔佛間的薄峽有如一匹白布，而鐵橋的遠處却是一片迷糊。夜晚，一片海風使人的精神從赤道的長日昏睡里淸醒，而月亮也會把大地幻成迷人的景色。</p>
<p>或者便是由於這種迷人的景物的影響吧，使柔佛王國溫柔地馴服於英帝國之下。佛柔王而今只成一個空殻，而柔佛的肥沃的國土是差不多完全呈獻於歐。美工業家的掌握里了。於是柔佛王年得薪俸若干，算是呈獻國土的代價；而他於被指揮着去簽名字在各種布告和命令上之餘，便只好挾着他的英婦漫遊世界去了。他，如果不把自己造成爲一個「風流天子」，你呌他去做什麽事，和能够做什麽事呢？（完）</p>

<h3>我譯「歐洲文學發達史」丨「論重譯及其他」的反應丨</h3>
<p>— 沈起予</p>
<p>廣州街頭，難得購着申報。今日偶得六月三十日之份，便見自由談內有穆木天兄的涉及拙譯「歐洲文學發達史」及王任叔兄的「社會學的藝術論」的大文。此兩書之出版均與木天兄有些姻緣，所以一年不曾執筆如我者，也想說兩句話。</p>
<p>（中略）我的「歐洲文學發達史」也頗與木天兄有些關係。我固知道重譯丨丨尤其是據日文重譯丨丨之難，於未執筆時，便先向外村史郎氏借了俄文原本。但我，並不識俄文，而知道木天兄是自修過的，所以於淌着大汗丨丨那是暑天丨丨翻遍東方圖書館之各國文學史以探尋那些浩瀚的往往出乎常識之外的書名，人名：：：之外，更當拿俄文本來求敎於木天。但仍不幸得很，該書中之Ｗoruku一字，旣非法文，也非日文，而我手中又無維尼全集，竟使我無從知道此字是「狼」，復使前日我所請敎之人，現竟發現了我這「好笑的錯誤」，更復有「這條狼旅行到俄國，再旅行到日本，更旅行到中國，就變成爲阿爾克先生了」的幽默（？），這是使我不能無感的。誠然，我也知道老友如木天者，决不會有惡意的指責的，何况上面還有「相當地忠實的」，「此點自然是日譯者的錯過」等的褒語呢。然而，錯畢竟是錯；待木天兄或他人有更完善的譯本時，拙譯自當自動取消。</p>
<p>據木天的關於重譯的意見，</p>
<p>是「要愼重行事，最好是根據兩國文字以上的譯本」。我雖無識，亦頗知斯旨之重要。但，無奈當時外村史郎氏曾告訴我「歐洲文學發達史」尙無英德法等文之譯本，而且選似乎以彼之譯本爲破天荒的第一部，所以我就祗好取了如木天兄所說的「從權」的辦法（下略）。</p>
<h3>我來自東（一）花時別華盛頓</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>華盛頓的城外開滿了櫻花，博河（Polamac）兩岸，游客如雲。一年一度，又是日本人宣傳「日美親善」的機會了。因爲華盛頓的幾株櫻樹，是前任東京巿長送過來的。當時那到了華盛頓沒有好久的齋藤公使，和他所謂美麗的太太，便穿着長裾大袖的日本衣帶着兩個圓扁臉孔的孩子，在櫻花下面很得意的跑來跑去，向游客們露着笑臉。更把在櫻花下面所拍的照片。在美國報紙上大登特登。那幾天華盛頓許多日貨商店，都用櫻花做他們窗子上面的裝飾品。而每個十字街頭，都掛着箭形的牌子，上面寫着：「櫻花時節到了！大家到博河看櫻花去罷！」</p>
<p>不過今年的櫻花時節，對於日本所謂「日美親善」的宣傳，倒沒有什麽裨益。固然華盛頓的人民對於櫻花的熱烈興趣，不减於往年，而齋藤公使的笑容，比前任出淵公使的要好看得多了！然而當時東京方面正宣傳所謂亞洲門羅主義，要美國退出遠東。美國人正討厭日本黑夜玩把戲；他們知道齋藤的笑容是勉强而虛僞的。厭惡日本的空氣，彌漫全美。而華盛頓的櫻花失去了不少的政治作用。</p>
<p>日本人在美國的一舉一動，多小總含些政治作用。他們的宣傳工作，是無孔不入的。譬如去年芝加哥舉行百年進步賽會，一位日本的絲業大王，便用日本絲造成許多小塊的美國旗；分送給美國的游客。一方面勸他們多買日本絲貨，一方面把美國人的愛國心和對日本的親善心，無形中聯接起來。更如去年美國反日空氣最濃厚的時候，日本便派許多的大學生到美國演放許多莫明其妙的影片：裏面不是暴露中國軍隊官廳，社會的腐敗及野蠻的樣子，便是鋪張日本在滿洲建設進步的狀况。他們更喜歡做一點小人情，以投美國人之所好。像送點日本的石刻與各大學；運點日本的櫻桃樹給美國城巿。費錢旣省，宣傳的價値又大。華盛頓城的櫻桃樹，從日本送來，已經好多年了。今年紐約一個新的公園落成，又有一大批的櫻桃樹，從東京運送過來。</p>
<p>雖然今年華盛頓的櫻花時節，比較的缺乏政治意味。但是他的美術意味，是不可否認的。在淸淸的博河兩岸，楊柳掛着黃金的線縷。櫻花雪一樣的盛開，遠望有點粉紅色。樹下是剪平了的草地。當你靠在臨河的欄桿上小憇，看那櫻林外的白石造成的林肯紀念堂，和倒影在水底五百多尺的華盛頓紀念碑。在遲遲的暮春陽光裏面，構成一幅幽靜而美麗的畫面。你會不相信在數呎之外，便是喧鬧紛雜的華盛頓巿街中心。</p>

<h3>巿長訓詞</h3>
<p>繼由巿長頒給證書、並致訓詞、略謂、今年各中學聯合畢業禮、所以在巿府舉行、因我們把中等學校聯合畢業禮當爲很重要的事情、各位知道中國有四萬萬五千萬人、能有機會讀書的很少、能受高深敎育機會的更少、故我們認爲各位在中學畢業是難能可貴、應隆重的舉行典禮、從今後上海各學校聯合畢業典禮、每年都要在巿府舉行、各位畢業後或升學或就業、但無論升學或就業、終身不要忘記國家社會父母家長對於你們的恩惠、時刻要謀報答將來升學的就要刻苦用功、不要半途而廢、等到求得高深學問之後、將所學者貢獻給國家社會、使國家社會多一個受高深學問的國民、而多得些益處、將來就業的、也要對國家社會很忠實的把智識能力貢獻、這樣就是不負國家社會父母家長之栽培、就是報答了國家社會父母家長的恩惠、今日中國危險已極、全國人民都在不安定狀態中、正好像一間破屋、一隻破船、在風雨飄搖、大浪澎湃之中、我們要挽救、須全國人民一心一德、尤其受敎育者更應多負責任、各位要明白今日不是養尊處優的時候、而是臥薪嘗膽的時候、是造飯吃的時候、不是吃飯的時候、是造屋住的時候、不是住屋的時候、目前大家都想吃現成飯、住現成屋、以至大家沒飯吃、沒屋子住、故我們要創造新的世界、學農的到農村去、學工的做工去、學礦的開礦去、不要走到一條路上去各位無論就業或升學、能認淸這點、國家前途才有光明、各位才不負國家社會父母家長的栽培、才算報答了恩惠云、</p>
<h3>黨部致詞</h3>
<p>巿黨部代表陶百川致詞略謂、剛纔巿長說各位無論升學就業要報答國家社會、但各位之中一定有許多不能升學又無業可就的，我們應如何中謀報答呢、普通人以爲不能升學即失學、這是錯誤的、升學固然得到求學機會、不能升學亦可以求學、初中畢業各種學識都有了小基礎、自己可以自修了、我們與其進不景氣的學校、還不如在家裏自修、社會上許多名人、都未進過大學而成名的、其次是失業、在各位年齡中也談不到失業、你們的年齡非就業的時期、而是求學的時期、即不能失學、在家裏自修、並非失業、而且事業要自己去創造的、在鄕村中可以就草蓬之下以敎育兒童、在都巿中可以就工廠附近辦民衆學校祇要各位實際去做、不愁社會沒有帮助、最後我們要明白中國弄到現在地步、根本原因是帝國主義的侵略、我們要努力做廢除不平等條約工作、驅逐帝國主義的勢力、而後可以升學可以就業云、</p>
<h3>來賓演說</h3>
<p>次來賓演說、社會局長吳醒亞演說略謂、中國現在是次殖民地的地位、自九一八以後、國難更嚴重、由中國問題而牽及世界和平之不能維持、和世界大戰之不可避免、我們在這世界大戰一旦爆發時、老年人和中年人當然站在前頭犧牲、爲國家民族求生存、但繼續此老年中年人以爲國家民族求生存的、實靑年學生、各位必須不斷的努力、在世界大戰中你們實中華民族的新生命、復興民族建設國家之責任都在各位身上、祈各位努力、尙有廖茂如·劉湛恩·陳人鶴等演說、辭長從略、</p>
<h3>學生答辭</h3>

<h3>第三章比賽的開始丨發球</h3>
<p>▲發球的姿勢、手法以、和發出力方位的研究</p>
<p>發球是比賽時每一局的開始、比賽員應用抽籤法决定誰有發球優先權、（通常都認爲先發球是有利益的）此種特權、直到一局終了後、才讓與對手、如是每局輪替享用、直到比賽終結、</p>
<p>發球時球員是要受極端限制的、此時應立在指定的地位、雙足不得越過端綫、亦不得觸及端綫、發球的地位、應在端綫中點和邊綫的中間、先右後左、輪替而行、發出的球應從網上越過、於接球者尙未還擊以前、落在對方對角的發球區以內、</p>
<p>發球者最大的限制、還是發出的球、在落到對方塲區內的時候、祇有很窄的地位、不像平常拍擊時、對方的塲區、是完全公開的、發球時、球落的地方、祗能够落在對方對角的發球區以內、此種發球區、大約僅佔全塲四分之一、然因球網的阻碍、發球區近網的一大部份、就完全等於沒有、球能落的地方、祗有後方五六英呎的塲面、所以實際上、祇有全塲十分之一的地位、</p>
<p>發球時、務要很重地拍擊、使球飛出很快、並且飛過網時、落在重地拍擊、使球飛出很快、並且飛過網時、落在對方塲地內所指定的發球區、此時又要採用一種襲擊的方式、將球很快地落在接球者難於應付之地位、發球者靈敏襲擊、和接球者的敏捷應付、都是網球技術上重要的部份、</p>
<p>發球者有兩次發球機會、所以利用這一點、許多會擊球的人乘機使第一次發出的球猛急而難接、但若是不幸第一次發球失誤、就更要聚精會神、愼重將事、勿使第二次再蹈前轍、因而失掉一分、因爲繼續發球二次失誤、即算失敗一分、現代實際上應用的發球方式、都是將球向上拋、手臂高舉、越過頭頂而拍擊、如是雙足要和球的飛程成平行綫、身軀側向着網、像在塲中拍擊一樣、所以左足（對於用右手發球的球員而言）要剛巧放在端綫的後面、擊球時、就像樵夫握着斧頭斫樹一樣、不過不能够用另一隻手來帮忙、</p>
<p>旣然有二次發球的機會、所以發球者的左手內要握二只球、甚至也有同時握三只的（但是著者不贊成握三只）預備發球時、一只球握在左手掌中、另一只球、則鉗在拇指和食指之間、此時的手法、要將球恰巧拋到預定拍擊的空間、所以要有長時間的訓練、才能每次如意、在球已拋向空中時、若是還要身軀移動方位去拍擊、是萬萬來不及的、並且移動時、必會影響到拍擊、而致失誤、</p>
<p>初學者在發球時、如左手僅握一只球、那是極大的錯誤、但他們偏愛這樣做、毫沒有注意到此種不良習慣的結果、要知道發球時第一次的失誤是難名的、於是第二次就應當馬上發出、簡直不要東張西望變更方位、發球者要確切地測定球落點的地方、和預算球的角度、速力和飛程、已經是極不容易的、所以旣經算定、在第一次失誤、第二次必要在原有的方位發現、若是左手僅握一只球、那麽在第一次失誤後、就必要移動方位去拾起另一只球、於是第二次發球時、眼中的角度就自然要變更、因而第二次的結果或較第一次更壞、</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我想不到他會跟我開玩笑，竟不曾注意他自己有沒有跪下去，價信以爲眞，撲的跑倒了；後來大家都笑了，我才知道上了他的當。太后也許根本還不曾起身咧！可憐的光緒，在名義上他是一個皇帝，但他是如何的孤寂悲傷啊！他祗能從這樣幼稚不足道的玩笑之中，找到一些快樂，更是何等的悽慘？當時我受了他的騙，雖也曾陪他笑了一回，可是退下來一想，我眞忍不住要替他哭了！我可以斷然的說，除却這種無聊的玩笑以外，他不用想再找到什麽快樂；他心裏頭所愛做的事情，偏不能做，不愛做的事情，却偏要他做。總之，無論到什麽地方去，他始終是一個囚犯的身份！</p>
<p>我們的列車，一到晚上就要停了；大槪車子在晚上的行動，不免有妨太后的安寗的緣故吧？車子旣停，一切聲息。也就同歸於盡；這樣，太后便可安臥了嗎？不，不，以太后的尊貴，豈能露宿在野外而沒有一些防衛呢！所以每到我們的車子一停，在後面遙遙地追隨着的一列兵車，便也跟着停下來；幾百名武裝齊全的警衛軍，忙從黑暗中爬下車來，悄悄地在我們這列車的四周，佈開了防哨。而在太后和光緒所乘的。（光緒的車上，兩邊也各有一條藍色的巨龍漆着。）兩輛車的旁邊，拱衛得格外的嚴密，簡直是全部給包圍住了。不過，太后自己還是可以自由下車的，祗要伊高興的話；而光緒却就不能越雷池一步了，旁的人也一槪不准走上去。他可說是已跟世界上的一切人，一切物，全隔絕了，和寂然獨處的孤魂野鬼無異。惟有在睡夢之中，他方能暫時跳出這個到處有惡魔躱藏着的大圈子去。（八四）</p>
<h3>採桑娘子</h3>
<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>每在這麽一個頭蠶吐絲的季節，便想起了額上紥着一方布中的採桑娘子來，伊們都是不辭勞苦能够忍耐的勤儉婦女，伊們早上起得早，晚上睡得遲，而且夜間還不得好睡，至少須喂上三四次的蠶葉。</p>
<p>早上，太陽還沒有出山，伊們便乘着桑葉上的露珠還不曾給太陽曬乾的當兒，就一個個地在額上包着那方布巾，連頭也不及梳地去採桑去了；上遠路的就背着一個乾糧袋，以備在中途肚饑時充饑的；在這些採桑娘子裏頭，可說村的，俏的，老的，少的都有，可是大槪是體格健全的靑春少婦，伊們可以用不到男人來帮採，伊們的體格可比我們都巿裏的男子要壯健得多了！而且那種勤儉健全的美德，眞使都巿裏的穿長旗袍塗黃胭脂的時代姑娘，要漸愧得無地自容了呀！</p>
<p>有時，伊們那種柔曼的風情，很容易打動每一個年輕熱情男子的情懷，他們每善用一種動人的音調，唱着一首南國鄕間的情歌，有時候伊們聽了他們的音調，也會情不自禁地互相酬和起來；但伊們决不會不知廉恥地像那些南方蠻夷民族的　情會似的，去允許一個男子找一個僻靜山凹裏男女任性地放蕩着的；但所謂「桑間濮上」的韻事，却也未始不會沒有呢？</p>
<p>但近年來受了農村經濟破產的壓迫，一般窮鄕婦女們爲着先得急於去想法怎樣塡滿那空着的肚子，伊們似乎不大有這種閒情逸致，再去想到調情這一類的韻事了呀！</p>
<h3>蘇州玄妙觀的十八景</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>遊杭州西湖的人，都知道西湖有十八景，那裏知道蘇州的玄妙觀，也有十八景的傳說，不過西湖十八景，是天然的風景，所以至今尙在，還可以指點出來，蘇州玄妙觀的十八景，却因有的是人工所成，有的已經湮沒不見，而且沒有一定的考據，所以便失傳了，不被人所注重。據相傳下來的蘇州玄妙觀十八景，是丨沒字碑丨大水盂丨六角亭柱脚丨五百尊羅漢丨釘釘石欄杆丨彌羅寶閣丨露台丨三淸菩薩丨石柱丨冲天爐丨銅人丨武當山丨妙一統元匾丨雙井丨哼哈二將丨白皮楊丨牛角浜尿　丨正山門買綫老太婆丨的十八樣，可是到了如今，已是大半不能瞧見的了。</p>
<p>沒字碑丨大水盂丨露台丨三淸菩薩丨妙一統元匾丨哼哈二將丨的六景，凡是到玄妙觀的人，都可以瞧見。彌羅寶閣，已燒掉了，如今改建了中山堂。石柱便是彌羅寶閣的石柱，都有雙合抱精細，自然也同毀於火了。雙井在方丈側面。武當山便是祖師殿內的一件古物，以前曾經有道士想偷賣掉的事實。銅人也是祖師殿的古物。釘釘石欄杆，是露台上的一面石欄，用鐵釘釘滿。六角亭柱脚，在三方昌茶居側面，這七景只須細細一查，就能知道了。冲天爐，是彌羅寶閣前的大香爐，現在是沒有的了。白皮楊在火燒彌羅寶閣時候，一同燒枯。五百尊羅漢，造在玄妙觀正山門和三淸殿的屋脊上，如今也七零八落的了，沒有法了再見。還有牛角浜尿　丨正山門買綫老太婆的兩景，別說是如今，不能得見。便是前二十年，也早已沒有的了，只用以前牛角浜一帶，排滿了幾十隻尿　，正山門起，直到露台下面，都坐滿坐了買綫的老太婆，所以竟成了兩景，到如今如何再可以瞧見呢？</p>

<h3>划香船</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>內地的城巿，農村，冷寂得委實太無生氣，在這裏，有許多廟會，香汎，點綴其間，沉悶的巿街上，因此會浮起一層熱鬧的空；禁止迷信，打倒神權，在農村社會，是談不到發生若何效力。</p>
<p>在每一次香汎期中，最佔着特殊勢力的，要算划香船的老板，他們撑持着一隻赤膊船，東村搖到西村，聚集了許多道公道婆，欵乃聲中，身着目的地駛去。</p>
<p>划香船的生活，雖然可從每一個老太婆的黃布口袋裏，賺出幾個銅元，但是最討厭的是等待着道婆們上船，什麽拿香咧，拿食物咧，你招呼我，我看望你，先在岸上聚齊，然後一聲木魚，一聲彌陀佛，緩步當車似的才慢慢的跑上船　　在水花濺潑，欵乃聲中，道婆們坐在兩邊船舷上，很虔誠的敲着木魚，誦着佛號，調劑着沉寂的空氣向前進行，當每一次佛號念完後，可以此起不少的談話，他們所說的，不是莊上王家大嫂偷漢子，就是李家老太婆對待媳婦怎樣壞，划船的老板只知撑着向前進行，其餘一切的一切，什麽事也不放在心中。</p>
<p>內地的香期，今天是東鎭，明天是西村，可以接續不絕的挨着次序給道婆們去燒香，划香船的老板，也挨着次序去幹，他們不但得着道婆們的船資，並可以得到廟祝的特別酒錢，他們的生活，是舒適的，是開放的，這種謀生的辦法，委實是鄕村間一種特殊的職業。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三十二回聲色自娛將軍終日樂　　老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>桂枝見這事好像不是並無關係。趁着收元宵到墻格子裏去的時候，拿出茶葉瓶子來，就着屋裏爐子上開水壼，沏上了一壼香片，然後打了烟葉子取燈兒，都交給了趙翁，又斟了一杯熱騰騰的茶，放在趙翁身邊桌子角上，這才退到對面椅子上坐下。趙翁喝了一杯茶，先向旁邊坐的江氏道：老太太，不是我誇贊你，你的姑娘敎導的眞好，這年頭兒，人心太懷，隨便一比，就把好人比出來了。江氏聽他說了這一篇話，摸不着頭腦，不知此話從何而起。便笑道：您還那樣說，孩子是你家的人，好賴是您家的事了，老太爺您是疼兒子，順便的就疼着兒媳啦。趙翁道：我說這話，是有原因的，自己兒女，還胡捧他作什麽？說到這裏，又歎了一口氣道：人心眞是難說。那位黃曼英小姐，和田連長很要好的，據人氏們看來，他們配成婚姻，那是沒有問題的吧？你瞧，我也是人心大變。還來句新名詞兒。桂枝聽到人這話，心裏就有幾分明白，其實，也不算什麽稀奇，自己老早就知道他有了表兄了。不過這話自己還不能先說破，便正了顏色道：他怎麽樣呢？趙翁道：是誰也想不到的事，他和甘二爺交上朋友了。桂枝聽了這話，眞有些不相信，然而還沉住了氣，向下聽。趙翁道：我不是親眼得見，我也不相信。就是昨日晚上，我看到甘二爺挽了他的手胳臂在街上走。江氏很快的看了桂枝一眼，然後向趙翁答道：他們怎麽會認識呢？趙翁道：我也是這樣說呀。昨晚上遇到他們倆的時候，倒是黃小姐先和我打招呼，我自然就站到一處說話了（四三五）</p>

<h3>歐羅巴巡禮</h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>▲從伯林寄來的信（上）</p>
<p>在比國蔴蘭蒭山寺隱居時，收到一封從德車伯林寄來的信。寄信人爲史蘭德夫人Ｅ．Ｓchnider，伊家住在魯文，丈夫是比國駐德欽使秘書。伊知道我是一個都會禮讚者，所以在來信中，特別描繪伯林的景物，我對於東歐羅巴州各大都會憧憬已久，將來如有機會，極願到伯林，維也納，蒲達貝斯德等處去作藝術巡禮。下面便從史蘭德夫人信中，譯出來的伯林寫照。</p>
<p>伯林，是世界摩登都會之一，是一個鼎沸的都巿。從早到晚，到處是囂鬧著的巿聲，車輪汽笛，老是不斷地在那裏轉滾嘯鳴。</p>
<p>這樣的一個首都，是一個强國優秀人民的中心，表現出日耳曼强毅精神的樞紐。</p>
<p>在中央車站附近，老淸早已經開始活動的景象，大紅在綠的廣告招貼，刺人眼簾。單是一個城巿的居民，其數目差不多等於全比利時國的人口，當然會使一個抱着好奇心的比國遊客，發生無窮的興趣。</p>
<p>我們現在到了威廉第一世的銅座下，那威武的德皇四週，環繞着其他染有斑綠色的銅像。離開這裏不遠，可以望見那座廣大的Schloss別墅，希臘廟宇式的正門，和叢林般　的石柱子。</p>
<p>穿過各條街道時，最好常常靠着那黃閣的人行道上行走，因爲馬路上車輛川流不息，偶不小心，便有送命的危險。我們應當嘆服路政管理設備的精細，路上車輛雖很擁擠，但是看不見巡警，各色車輛服從那特置燈光的指揮，秩序井然，毫不紊亂。多麽壯嚴，多麽有益的紀律！</p>
<p>到處交錯駛走着的車輛，有高架電車，公共汽車，運貨車，汽車，脚踏車：流覽着這些有紀律的人民，幾使人忘了吃飯的時刻。各式各樣的飯館，幾使人難於選擇遞從，菜單上巧立名目的食品，呌人望而興嘆。若使你有機會到伯林來吃飯，我推薦一道好東西，你切勿忘記嘗嘗Delicaiesses　de　la　Baltigue的滋味！</p>
<p>你要知道多少價錢，等到算帳的時候，包你會把臉孔拉長起來：：：</p>
<p>飯後到一家點心店裏去喝茶，這點心店有七座大客廳和七隊管絃樂隊。在那不vaserland餐館裏，佈置得很美化，在大廳一角，我們可以眺望人工的自然風景，亞爾怕山的鳥瞰全景，萊茵河畔，乍見太陽升起，乍見狂風暴雨，我們可以看見眞的雨水，和電光：：：</p>

<h3>紗花近遠期紗差額漸鉅</h3>
<p>▲多頭傾向遠期：本月無意收貨</p>
<p>妙巿稍疲、因美棉微跌、多頭獲利了結、致檯�</p>
<p>面鬆動、而本月份收貨者尙缺乏、故人心雖良好、對於近期買者不多、心思一味傾向遠期、因此近遠期關價距離愈遠、照此情形而論、將後仍不脫套利一法也、紗巿就目前狀况仍難看小、</p>
<h3>標紗買氣稍淡</h3>
<p>標紗前巿開盤、巿氣平淡、買風亦定、而外棉微落、各月亦跌二三角、拍至二盤、多頭在遠月仍抬價、然仍難引起買戶、收三盤依然平疲、結果各月跌五六七角、成交統計二萬一千七百包、查賣出大孚一千八百包、恒益七百包、振大五百包、賡豐一千八百五十包、均昶一千包、恊成五百包、恊生六百包、德記七百包、買進錦昌六百包、愼昌一千零五十包、大福六百五十包、愼記一千二百包、益昶五百五十包、長豐一千零五十包主、永大一千零五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>棉花突見下落</h3>
<p>棉巿突跌、形勢又轉軟化、因上週末漲風太暴、多料美棉趨漲、記來電平疲、以致浮多了結、同時巿塲消息、外埠邇來時有陣雨下降、棉田補救不淺、因之巿勢乃鬆懈、惟一般投機商以美棉前途看漲、逢跌吸收、加碼心意殛濃、不過邇來日商舉動絕少云、</p>
<h3>鄭標回跌三四角</h3>
<p>標棉前巿開盤、巿價突落、因美棉轉跌十磅音、且上日週末漲風太狂暴、而氣候轉凉、晨間天空浮雲滿佈、大有雨象、於是人心更鬆、賣風稍起、巿價驟跌、而陳棉多頭公司翻空、並有交貨之說、巿情愈弱、遠月帶疲、惟投機商目光、對於美棉看好、逢跌購進加碼、就大勢論之、新棉價高、當然有貨者拋賣、所以在新花時代、不能完全與外棉並進的、標花各月均跌三·四五角、全日成交統計十一萬三千九百擔、查賣出惠康四千二百擔、長豐三千一百擔、益豐二千四百擔、崇安三千擔、新亨一千二百擔、愼記二千一百擔、大福一千二百擔、瑞大一千二百擔、賡豐一萬二千五百擔、穗隆一千四百擔、梅記五千九百擔、吉豐一千三百擔、買進大豐五千八百擔、裕康二千二百擔、源大一各八百擔、錦昌二千一百擔、明德一千五擔、均昶二千一百擔、遠大三千一百擔、仁豐五千九百擔、同興一千二百擔、泰昌一千四百擔、益昶二千五百擔、長豐五千六百擔、潤康四千六百擔、大昶一千三百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>棉田减少　上週美棉漲一百磅音</h3>
<p>紐約七月十三日電告一週棉巿狀况云、出人意外的利於多方之棉田報告、使棉價抬起每磅約一分後、棉巿卒因獲利了結與南方售出而稍回跌、雖投機需求尙形活動、但同業購進則殊平平、棉巿實際地位現可認爲稍弱、因堆積近來頗重也、南方現貨需求亦未有顯著進步、棉田報告、已予同業以計算可能的產量之切實根據、今後最重要原因、厥爲氣候、台克薩斯州溫度仍異常高亢、北部與西部亟須陰雨、聞較乾區域、棉作已退化、不過氣候順利之區域、則棉作已有進行也、他處棉作狀况、大都非良好即平妥、美東部墨西哥灣諸州雖有陣雨、但未聞果蠧虫增甚之報告、棉貨巿况較前稍堅、布廠現提高售價、</p>
<h3>上週印棉巿價步昂</h3>
<p>上週棉巿、因美棉田政府報告發表後、棉田人减、巿價步昂、在新棉走動以前、巿况將利於買方、出口問訊參差、歐洲靜寂、日本較前活動、尤以中印度甘地虛及歷傑司棉爲最、天氣甚佳、各地已從事軋取預備、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食標粉繼漲增高</h3>
<p>▲交易大暢：：形成軋空</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、上午開盤後、各月份又呈巨大之漲風、而交易之盛、亦爲年來所僅見、半日計達一百八九十萬包之巨、至巿面之錯雜凌亂、亦爲幾年來之第一次、當開價時、因國內外情形、或則霪雨成災、或則旱魃施威、所以人心之激昂、是爲不可免之事實、兼之北方亦因水旱之失調、糧價昂貴、傳天津現貨、喊起六分、開二元三角至八角、因此本月份開價即二角六分、後則步步抬高、形成軋空之象、廠　籌自抵、外行空戶、亦急抵進、故最高軋至二角九分半、遠期各月份、漲勢固亦見狂、惟以獲利多頭、趁高出檔、廠家亦見拋售、交易雖亦大盛、漲度則祗一二分、此種景象、旣由天災所促成、如果天道好還、甘霖即下、則巨大之恐怖、或能稍抑、否則潛勢甚大、實少鬆動之機會也、結果較前週漲五分半、八月份漲二分七釐半、九月份漲二分半、十月份漲一分七釐半、十一月份漲二分半、十二月份漲二分云</p>
<h3>期麥見小小回風</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面、上午開盤後、呈先漲後則平落之態、以洋麥報價、兩處祗好一二角左右不等、當開價後、因國內外之災情、頻傳惡化、致業內外人心、又見俏利、各月份較前週好三五分不等、迨至二盤以後、因大戶多頭出籠、形勢突然轉變、浮多亦趁勢出檔、故各月分均由高而向下、此種狀態、實爲激漲以來、小小回勢也、結果本月份反小三分、八九月份好一分、十月份好二分、十一·二月份不動、現麥因紛巿激昂、客戶心思、扳售甚力、各檔開價又喊起五六分、開徐州麥三元三角二分、五河麥三元三角、次二角三分、臨淮麥二元二角八分、蕪湖麥三元、滁州麥三元二角六分、六合麥三元二角、江新州麥三元一角半、大橋麥三元二角、瑤灣麥三元二角七分、淸江麥三元二角半、由福新去一萬二千包、阜豐去八千包、信大去三千包云、</p>
<h3>洋米新定十萬包　▲每百斤四元一角半　▲洋客秈巿上而復下</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈巿况、初以南方旱災已成、而北方復有水災發生、人心十分恐慌、本街內地與囤戶之進胃更健、大巿機靖已漲至九元四角、其他各米一律喊高、繼因荳米業已經限制米價與訂定洋米之决議、更擬請求除免洋米稅之進行、巿上人心已爲向下、施聞各米行已直接向洋商訂定即裝一號西貢十萬包（一說頭批五千噸·二批尙未决定）、訂價每百斤國幣四元一角半、關稅水脚一切另加、總計以一百五十斤司碼稱計算合價當在十元以下、此價與現巿已可相近、倘今後米價再漲、或能减免捐稅、則定戶即可圖利、巿上聞此消息後、進戶胃口即淡、連日飛升之小絞米、立自八元八角降至八元半、人心旣定、巿價亦小、統巿開出各米一萬二千包、多數爲本街辦去、北洋及內地各去一千多包云、</p>
<h3>限價後米價續落</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源祇十七八號、（貨共二千六七百石）、銷塲自一度限價後、人心轉平、包胃僅威海衛帮辦去六七百包、特別晚稻巿面續呈垂軟之象、常帮蘇同南港等粳及靑角松泗西練等晚稻行情、再度跌落一二角不等、僅杜洋尖及變元等賴貨乏、猶見定局耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十二三號、巿上各貨去胃平常、早薄稻略交、白元及各尖零拆稍化、白粳價小角外、餘貨無甚上落、</p>
<h3>九江新荳突漲二角</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆比上週末巿無變化、但去路不弱、人心立定、計廠家辦去頴州豆及蚌埠豆約有十五六車、本街零戶去正陽關豆二車、九江新城門荳昨巿第二批抵埠、其數不多、貨品亦遜、共到二百十四包、致買方心意畸形、放價爭辯、故巿突漲二角、爲三元四角、寗波帮辦去、照業中人云、昨之荳品亦不佳、巿况亦無暴升、</p>
<h3>南北貨蘭竹枝蘭花子登新</h3>
<p>漳州所產蘭竹枝、烏葉枝、今庚因歡收、成本較昂、暫難劃申、惟聞本屆出品較去年爲佳、故昨日太古輪入口稍有運到試巿、查統共不及三十箱、其成本蘭竹枝在四十元零、烏葉枝二十六七元、如果貨品高超、或能保本、</p>
<p>蘭花子本屆新貨出數不盛、首批昨到十餘箱、貨品尙屬黃亮、惟尙有半數、色澤較次、以到數不多、當能好銷、</p>
<h3>糖巿本綿白出貨稀少</h3>
<p>昨日糖巿趨勢依然平平、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨呌原價未成、本棧貨二十元、比前日小去五分、轉口貨六元四角、荷赤轉口貨呌六元三角、太古Ｂ嘜二十元四角、本廠綿白近以天氣酷熱、工人大都停手、故出貨稀缺、原價十九元、亦未多開、海南赤昨開四百包之譜、高莊十三元、次十二元八角至七角、高綿赤開數十包、十六元、</p>
<h3>絲茶新絲走銷頻暢</h3>
<p>▲新白廠經運杭杭垣各絲織商、於新繭上巿後、在滬拋進新白廠經爲數不弱、各廠商紛紛依期繅解、分批運杭、本月上半月計有新繭白廠經一百三十五包運往長安長山門等站、以應機需、類均Ｂ字等級二十至二十二條份、</p>
<p>▲新輯里經運滬浙湖各蠶區、今歲春繭豐收、蠶戶因鮮繭價小、自繅土絲者多、潯（南潯）震（震澤）兩埠絲行收下之土絲、均交各機戶複搖輯里乾大經運滬、銷售洋莊、茲因入夏以來、天久不雨、內河水淺、輪運艱阻、故各產地所存之輯里經、現在分批趕運來滬、最近半個月中已由申湖班小輪裝到各級白乾經二百二十件、均分存絲棧待售、</p>
<p>▲紐約日絲進口仍旺紐約絲織廠、均因酷熱而休假、生絲巿面異常沈靜、日絲進口仍旺、現絲價又慘跌、標凖日絲每磅祗開美金一元一角强、扯合華幣每包又跌進四百元大關、</p>
<p>▲浙屬夏繭產歉質次浙屬今歲夏繭、收成歉折、而繭身不厚、滬絲商赴浙收買夏繭者寥寥、昨日海寗方面有新樣繭七十四斤運滬、現已付廠試騐繅折、據稱烘折在四百斤以上、</p>
<p>▲美莊囤積廠經本埠歐美各莊、鑒於紐約存絲祇敷月餘之需求、暑假開工後、各綢廠勢必補購原料、而白廠經價已跌至最低限度、故均乘機抑價拋購、各廠商手中餘繭較充者、祗得忍痛拋售、以維工作、計怡和等進Ｂ級新白廠經一百三十包、價仍不振、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉繼續下跌</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶巿、來路莊之珍眉絲茶、到銷旺盛、惟自上星期婺源珍眉貶跌後、英法行家、對於屯溪歙縣等路貨、認盤一致苛緊、先後開出新低價、即如屯溪貨縮至九十五元、遂安貨縮至八十元、婺源東路貨縮至一百○二元、其餘針眉珠茶等項、巿盤亦均看跌、綠茶巿面、殊非佳象、至祁門寗州紅茶、交易雖略形活潑、但售盤有跌而無漲、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢絨巿面之預測　丨見仁見智各有理由丨</h3>
<p>淡暑灼人、呢絨交易、五六月中年有一番停頓、至於秋冬新巿面、業中人已極注意、互有預測、同一之貨、有看漲而或云跌、如大巿面初皆看漲、近則看平、其原因則爲關稅見减、匯票轉好、成本輕廉故也、兼查上春套頭分料、本街諸西服帮齊多擱存、秋塲生意必見减少、外埠各客帮動辦、巿面或因之而上升、但如薄花呢·嗶嘰華特呢·元直貢呢等、有日貨進口傾銷、巿氣始終難以轉好也、人字毛花呢、普通四五元一碼之大衣呢、下半年巿面定能見好上漲、因馬褲呢大衣打倒、盛行人字毛花呢（尤以四元光竟最形旺銷普及）、兼無日貨織出故也、以上云云、亦不過巿場上之一種論調、未可作正巿觀也、</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>再談方巾氣</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>前見本埠增刊中，有某君所做「方巾氣」一文，不禁觸動我的心緒，因此推想到家國不亡則已、亡則必與方巾氣多少有關。</p>
<p>前年我曾提倡過短衣生活，提議把現在男子的服式，大加改良，我所主張的理由是，自辛亥革命以來，所謂國利民福喊了多時，但除剪掉辮子一事，確實有些福民外，此外一些我不到所謂國利民福，又因此想到自辛亥以來，女子的衣服，千變萬化，光怪陸離，已極摩登變遷的能事（但是太摩登）而男子的服式，猶襲滿淸之舊，毫無變更，（這是太守舊）所以欲喚起國民精神，提倡簡單生活，應該先把衣服制度刷新起來，當時有許多人主張，照中山學生裝式樣長僅及膝，而全用中國裁衣法裁製，計其便利，約有三點，㈠行步便利，㈡可省衣料，㈢若遇雨雪，可免拖泥帶水之累。但自提倡以來，承蒙贊成的，頗不乏人，但是結果沒有看見一個實行，無非紙上談兵，空鬧一時，絕不發生半點效力。</p>
<p>這是什麽緣故呢？一言蔽之，多是方巾氣的作祟，他們一定會想，假定一變了服式，倘被人看見，有些難爲情，有些不好意思，卽自己看看，亦覺有失紳士體統，著上短衣，似乎走不出門，而在傍人看來，亦必說是下等坯子，不像樣，不大方，此是什麽心理呢？就是方巾氣的心理。</p>
<p>古者異言必禁，異服必誅，方今又是祗重衣衫不重人的世界，長衫袍子，何等體面而可貴的事呢？所以從前的讀書人，雖口口聲聲說「儒冠誤我」，但是到底决不肯把儒冠拋掉，到如今試看幾位拆字先生，和算命朋友，無論長衫袍子破碎垢膩到若何地步，但是决不肯把一領方巾氣的長衫脫去，就是長衫同志，弄到落花流水，潦倒不堪，甚而至於在路傍告地狀，而他們的長衫，還是死不肯脫。</p>
<p>試問什麽不肯把此衣服脫去呢？因爲我是上等人，我是讀書人，我是體面人，若著短衣，便有失身分，便變成下等人，亦是「餓死事小失禮是大」的一種慒懂觀念，我再問上等人與下等人其階級果然分別在長衣和短衣麽？假定你是毫無人格的人，無論你衣服著的十分漂亮二十分道地，總是「下作」，若是你有人格的人，就是短衣，恐亦無傷大雅，就再那事實來講，現在爲實利主義的時代，樣樣式式趨重實際，不尙虛文，爲什麽又便利又省料的衣服不穿，偏要去穿累墜不堪的長衫袍子呢？脫脫長衫是否有失身分呢？此種地方還一些看他不穿，還有什麽辦法。</p>
<p>近來德國希特勒頒布優生法律，獎勵結婚，而把身體衰弱及患有惡疾者，一律割勢，他的計劃，無非爲欲强種起見，現在我國之所以不振，多因爲「揩鼻頭」「方巾氣」的朋友太多，多是骨瘦如柴，小白臉，文弱書生，多是國產的道地貨，如戲劇中的「小生」一般扭扭揑揑令人看看肉麻，我國若多是這樣一宗的人物，就是他國不來亡我，我國亦必自亡的。</p>
<p>從前哥侖布，肯把一蛋擊碎，便發現新大陸，我國的國民，處現在的環境中，若再不把這樣頑固的結習，等級的觀念，一齊打破起來，正是無藥可救了，不過我還有一句聲明的，不是脫了長服，換了短衣，便能强國强身，必須要那各種的事業，樣樣像衣服般的刷新起來，振作起來，方能有救，否則衣服的樣式，儘管換新，而「揩鼻頭」「方巾氣」的態度，依舊不改，原是不濟事的。</p>

<h3>三談托兒所與公育</h3>
<p>— 師石</p>
<p>（三）公育與兒童實施公育能否福利兒童？這是一個最根本的問題，父母之愛爲兒童生命上的糧食，這種理論上的話業於前文詳述，我人再從事實上下觀察，却可見兒童離開家庭托諸公育機關，其結果會「絕滅生機而惡化天性，」肉體精神，兩受殘害；筆者前引莫斯科公育兒童死亡率，係根據英人漢米爾頓新著（Memory　of　Soviet　Russia一九三一版聞別發寄售），茲九君有所懷疑，似嫌輕率；其實如此類例證，眞不勝枚舉：如美國名社會學家愛而華特Charleoa　Ellwood所著Sociology　ann　ModernSocial　Problem一書中所載巴黎公育兒童死亡率，與尋常兒童爲四之三與四之一之比；該書爲研究社會科學與婦女問題者之必要讀物，當更信而有徵了，再按兒童離開家庭，在精神上人格上所生影響，尤屬可驚；據一九○九年美國三十四處宮立兒童感化院報告：所收容頑童百分之二九係父母離異，百分之三二係父母不全，百分之三七係父母犯罪，此項兒童，什九爲幼被父母遺棄無家可歸靈，反之，在椿萱並茂的美滿家庭之下，兒童罪犯實不到百分之一，又據英[丨&gt;在碼頭上（木刻）羅淸楨作&lt;丨]</p>
<p>國鮑司德感化院調查：留院者百分之九十以上爲無家之孤兒；最奇者出身於代育所貧兒院的兒童，也佔百分之二七强；這可見兒童對家庭生活與父母敎養，關係何等重大，公育是否福利兒童，也可想而知了。</p>
<p>至於在「兒童公育」的原則下舉辦的托兒所，現時恐怕只有蘇物一國；他們的托兒所並不「代育」，祇是「寄養」；以「自己母親喂自己兒女」爲必要條件，嚴格言之，亦不與「公育」本旨相符，在歐美各國，大都係在宗敎團體庇護下所設的，帶有慈善性質的代育所，其實祇是改良的育嬰堂而已、茲九君所稱「現實」，不知何據？最近本巿有勞働托兒所之設，筆者並不反對，記得「周禮」載：「大司徒以保息養萬民，一日慈幼，」唐元和間有詔曰：「嬰兒無親屬者及有子不能養者，　給之，」在此種主旨下剏立的代育機關，那當然是値得贊許的了。</p>
<h3>七一四卽景</h3>
<p>— 小鶯</p>
<p>近兩天，在人們的臉上，浮露着一普遍的，在高貴的人們，是不會有什末得異的感覺，有感覺的，却是那一羣勞動的人們呵！</p>
<p>眞够掃興，由紛紛地傳說上，知道今年的「燈會」又無望了，然而那，不必介意，無論如何，總有些熱鬧的。</p>
<p>假使你在上了燈以後，能有功夫到具有異國情調的神秘街頭，那，多少是能得些刺激的。步伐，自然是不會相同的，那匆匆地，在表示着急迫，那緩慢的，在表示着幽閒，那不急不離的，在象徵着他心情的妥洽呵！至於姿式，當然也不會同樣的，沉着的，柔美的，傾斜的：：：總之，那是不勝枚舉的。</p>
<p>汽車，似乎也應該來應點這偉大的時會，敞蓬子的，轎式的，跑車式的，：：在這裏，不限定要油光滑亮，卽使你駕一部破得難堪的老爺車，跟踪着大隊的後背，也會令人側目的。</p>
<p>看，年紅的火炬失去了牠往常的權威，無聲息的，躱在那店面的門前喘着氣。店裏，把貨物連繫着，綴成了很巧小的國徽，旗幟，在房前和樹腰中飄動。</p>
<p>A.K.Soda　Fotain的房外，幾個藍眼珠子的女人在談笑着，吃着冷品，一股醉人的幽香吹送過來，勞動的人們呆住了。</p>
<p>很不容易的，擠上了電車，人的熱流在傳播着，大槪總有點覺得苦惱吧？許多的人在嘆息。</p>
<p>丨哎喲，什末事體，外國人的燈有什麽好看，自己家裏的燈還沒有看够嗎？賣票的人這樣說，很不耐煩的。</p>
<p>的確，外國人的類有什麽好看呢？看了以後你又覺得怎樣呢？呵，不必想那麽許多吧！在現在，是要演進爲大同的時候，假使都不去看，搭了那麽多的燈彩，那眞掃興。</p>
<p>電車不像平時一樣一直的前進，走不了幾步就會停住的，怪悶人的，短短地一叚八仙橋，會走了四十五分鐘。不用說，在那牌樓燈下，人是更擁擠了。</p>
<p>不錯，今天法國公園是很熱鬧的，但那，畢竟是法國的公園哪　！然而，無論如何，牠是有一種勢力，襲擊着每各人的心頭，於此，我也　了進去。</p>
<p>樹上，路心，閃動着紅紅綠綠的燈，像繁星似的，在到處的擠眼。草地上，坐滿了人，男的，女的，以至於正在啼哭的，行人道上，那人羣像潮浪似的奔湧着，嘿，瞧吧！中國的人口眞够榮繁，榮繁到能使公園裏正在修築的工程破壞迨盡，能使齊整的花木狼藉不堪；這，不過才是在上海的幾十分之一呵！</p>
<p>出了邊門，一陣熱風橫掃過來，怪悶人的，向北面看看，一片紅光煊染了半天。</p>
<h3>鞭痕</h3>
<p>— 珍妮</p>
<p>痛苦的站在自來水管面前摸着胳膊上那許多條紫紅色的鞭痕！</p>
<p>這是給師父剛用那皮鞭子抽過的。但他一想起那皮鞭子，神經就頓時駭得一跳，彷彿那皮鞭子現在還在他身上抽着似的；同時，那原有的紫紅色鞭痕，便覺得隱隱地在作痛起來了。</p>
<p>究竟是爲着什麽事情會使師父那麽狠狠地用皮鞭子抽着他，他到現在還是惘然地不知道，實在在今天他覺得並沒做錯什麽事情，要受這重的處分！並且他一向不貪懶，做事都井井有條，是從不有誰憎厭他的！</p>
<p>他是×記理髪店內的徒弟！爲徒弟簡直是給師父做出氣筒呵！</p>
<p>他的父親是一家公館裏的包車夫，家住在楊樹浦那一帶，母親就在左近×工廠裏當女工。他們夫妻倆因將汗血所換來的工資，還不能維持全家的麵包，便不得不相託親友，把兒子薦到×記理髪店來當徒弟！</p>
<p>自然，爲父母的人，怎不知道兒子之受師父的痛苦？可是，知道又有什麽用呢？雖痛苦，一天三餐是怎樣也不會餓肚皮了呀！</p>
<p>於是，今天雖又挨了師父的皮鞭子，他反覺得比挨餓總好上萬倍，因爲在他沒有進這爿理髪店的那前一年，他曾餓了二天光景才得吃到一個大餅。不過，這痛苦究竟是難當的啊！他本能地去瞧胳膊上的鞭痕了！</p>
<p>［突然的，師父跑出來了，仍是擺出一副威嚴的臉，站在他面前，嚕囌啦：「老是站在這兒幹嗎？是不是又要挨皮鞭子？外面地板上的頭髪去掃掃乾凈！：還不走？：：」</p>
<p>他於是垂下那二支滿了紫紅色鞭痕的胳膊，離開了自來水管前，機械地跑到外面去了。</p>
<h3>拉</h3>
<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>在一個一百度以上的中午，太陽曬軟了路上的瀝靑，我怱怱地走過街。</p>
<p>街上的瀝靑是軟軟的，交通燈跟着巡捕口中呌笛轉到了綠色的時候，停着的車子與人的滯流都怱忙而又愚蠢地開始移動了。跟在一大串的車子後面，我看到許多人在死勁地拉動一架裝了許多鋼條的大貨車，拉的人是赤了膊的，皮膚，原來該是棕黑色的，可是在這鎔鐵爐中的火燄般的太陽下面，流了汗，又沒有拭去的機會，身上淋了水，給太陽照着便像金屬一樣地發光了。用着力，用着力丨這古銅色的筋肉的緊張不是力的表現麽？拉着繩子，繩子有樻棒那麽粗的繞過肩頭，拉着拉着，便一半陷進肉裏去啦。把肩頭和背項刻出了一條深深的溝。幾個人，全是那樣的，身子死命的向前傾，和地面成了一個銳角，死命地，又瞧着交通燈的綠，發急着，怕它一時變了紅色，便不得過街啦，就這樣地，大家彼此望了望（合意地），各人）</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>的嘴裏喊着「拉呀」，「拉呀」，俗大的貨車便愚蠢地動了。</p>
<p>一個印象像電一般地閃過：「多艱難的生存的奮鬥哪。」</p>
<p>忘了太陽的熱，就站在熱的陽光中，看他們在交通燈的綠光中艱難地過了街。</p>
<p>而，街上的車子又照樣地懦動着，自己却也像在拉着一些什麽笨動的東西一樣的，覺得有一種重量，一種力，在身後吊着。可是就這樣，我也死命地拉着自家兒的生命從險的沸熱的路上艱難地走了許多路啦。無疑地，現在還是在困苦艱難的路上奔跑，而這艱難，當落在我們一代的身上，恐怕未來的現實的面貌會呌我們更加害怕咧。然而，那有什麽關係呢？讓身後擔子儘量地把重量增加吧，讓大路變得更沸熱，更峻險，與更黑曹吧；當我們生存的本能在後面帮我推，而生存的目的又在前面帮我們拉的時候，路的峻險與勞動的苦難對我們又有些什麽關係呢？</p>
<p>瞧着伕子的拉車，力的表現却啟示我啦。每個奮鬥都不是愉快的事，然而在受着苦難的時候，他們却知道互相對站在同一方向拉着的人喊一聲「拉呀」（會意地），而這一聲，在他們中間，無疑地將是一種共同合作的允許，彼此互助的安慰，他們在路上不停地喊着，喧鬧着；而我懂得，就因爲有了這彼此的允許和安慰，他們才有踏着艱難的步子的勇氣。</p>

<h3>職業能生活嗎？</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>女界是可憐的！尤其是半新半舊的中國女界！我自父母亡過之後，家裏有兩個弟弟和一個妹妹，家境自然是窮苦的，但這也不用說了，只說我自身問題，請先生敎導。</p>
<p>我今年二十一歲了！讀過初中，讀過高中，讀過私塾；可是沒有一張畢業文憑。受資格的枷鎖，找不出什麽事情來做，不得已，當這樣的環境，不客氣說，過了賣面似的生話，當了商店伙計半年了：這種工作，到了年齡一大，一定是不得安其位，像我多愁多病的人，老大是很快的。所以，我自應打算終身的大計：</p>
<p>剛好在店裏，常常來一位先生買東西，由認識而至於結交。他和我很好，年齡比我長二歲，國內大學畢業，在機關辦事，月薪可得百餘元，很有意和我結婚，甚至和我海誓山盟，萬無遺棄的事體，可是後來談到他已經結婚了，使我暈倒在地，不知所措！</p>
<p>他說：「他一定不負我，然而重婚罪怎麽好呢？」我做他的小妾，法律上亦無此規定，我也不甚願意，當做姘婦！那更糟了！因此，弄得我無家可歸，無孔可入！我最後得他安慰說：「他是粵籍，就要回南洋，若到美國，一年就得了碩士學位，回來定和我結婚。」現在我的生活費，都是他供給，因爲我和他很熱烈的時候，店務廢馳，職務已被開除。他要我再去讀書，限定兩年期間，習得一種能够自己生活的職業。我想來想去，職業能够生活嗎？兩年學得成功嗎？呌我自謀生活，定是和我斷絕關係的意思；或者是藕斷絲連。但這種沒有臉子的過下去，生落世上，有何樂趣。再提起結婚問題，他和他的太太有萬分不能離異的情感，我也絕對不肯做那種無德行的奪愛偷情的女性。「一失足便成千古恨，」嫁不得嫁，招不得招，可憐的女子，和男子不同的點，實在很多，自由是我們大家所犧牲性命要求的，自由也是我們墮落的路徑，恐怕我的問題，只有鐵路上的軌道和黃浦江的長流，替我解决了！但先生或許有更好的方法，姑請先生敎導一下，使我有所依從，實在感謝得很。敬祝</p>
<p>身體安康！陳詠蓮鞠躬</p>
<p>答：我仔細誦讀你的來信，覺得你還是把結婚當做入「給養院」一樣，物質生活，精神生活都需結婚纔得解决，抱着這種「寄生蟲」心理的人，固然大有人在，怪不得你，在現在這種社會關係下女子是被迫着非做寄生蟲不可的，然而因爲這，你就覺得「終身的大計」無法安排，「只有鐵路上的軌道和黃浦江的長流」纔能替你解决問題。其實你的遭遇雖然可憐，却也不見得是死路一條，祗要你做事有勇氣，有獨立精神，你的問題正是極容易解决的。</p>
<p>那個大學生與你結交，雖然未必具有純潔的念頭，多少不免帶點玩弄女性，謀自己肉慾的滿足的心理，現在也許眞的想和你「斷絕關係」，但是他還希望你用兩年功夫，去習得一種能够自己生活的職業，究非喪盡良心者可比。換句話說，你遇了他還不是遇到了一個騙子，你的終身還沒有斷送在他的手裏。依我想，你苦悶的原因，是你把自己估量得太低，所以你發生了「職業能够生活嗎？」「兩年學得成功嗎？」等問題，好像女子除依賴丈夫外是無法生活的。這種奴隸心理你是要澈底淸除的，否則，就是眞正得到了你所謂的歸宿，也祗是一輩子做人家的奴隸。你雖然沒有得到學校正式文憑，但你已有高中程度，就你這封來信說，字跡極淸秀整齊，文句亦流利順達，馬虎點的大學畢業生也許還趕不上你，所以，你並不是毫無基礎的人，如果再有兩年的時間給你學習，保險你能學到一種專門技能。因此，你也正不怕沒有找到「能够生活」的職業的資格。我以爲問題的中心，是你做事要牢靠，他現在雖允許你兩年時間求學，但不知此二年的學費及生活費可給你沒有，如果沒有，你務必要他一次給足，免得他中途變卦，這是最最緊要的。</p>
<p>當然，女人嫁丈夫的目的，雖則現在都以爲是爲了「吃飯」，其實並不如此簡單，家庭生活和配偶慾望是人類的天性。但是現在一般人不能結婚的問題，大都還是起因于經濟的原因，假如經濟問題一解决，困難就少得多了。你如果經濟獨立，那你要與人結婚就容易得多，現在一般薪傭勞働者大都希望得到一個不要負担經濟責任的妻子。就是你對於那個大學生極好，舍他莫屬，那也能繼續維持雙方的關係；在現在情形下，你非與他經過結婚形式不能維持，在那時就不必了，雙方的愛情，是不必要經過結婚形式纔能維繫得住的。所以在兩性生活上，你也並不是絕望的人。</p>
<p>你的問題是不成問題，所成爲問題的是自己不要把自己不當人，把自己看作寄生蟲。編者</p>

<h3>復仇（二）</h3>
<p>— 匈牙利尤利巴基羅嘉譯</p>
<p>四輪馬車在一棟街房的大門口停着。母親第一個下去等着她的女兒。但女兒仍然生着不動好像沒有要跟下去的意思。</p>
<p>『我們已經到家了。』母親詫異起來。</p>
<p>『好！就知道：：：你去睡吧！』</p>
<p>『迎覽！』</p>
<p>爲了使車夫聽不懂她們的對話，女郞用法語說：</p>
<p>『明天已經是婚期了，我服從你們，可是今天我還自由，我還得任意來處置我自己。』</p>
<p>『你想做什麽呢？』</p>
<p>『我要報復我自己：：：我想出一神眞正的女人的報復：：：』</p>
<p>母親恐怖地注視着她的女兒，猜到那可怕熱結果，她呌着：</p>
<p>『你發瘋了。你想做什麽呢？』</p>
<p>女郞笑起來，痛心地但幾乎是戚脅地說：</p>
<p>『我將來要告訴你的：…諾，不要害怕。我不會自殺而且也不會防礙恢復父母底企業的財產的基礎的。我僅僅祇要給自己報復一下：：：』。</p>
<p>『可是時候這樣晚了，你還到什麽地方去呀？：：：你瘋了你完全瘋了。』</p>
<p>代替回答的是女郞給車夫的命令：</p>
<p>『喂，再回到跳舞塲去！』</p>
<p>國輪馬車開始跑起來。母親絕望地喊着想阻止他們，女郞却不停地向車夫下着命令。</p>
<p>『假使你很按地將我送到希爾達街的話，可以給你很多的酒錢。』</p>
<p>『不是到跳舞廳嗎？』</p>
<p>『不！到希爾達街！你明白了嗎？』</p>
<p>『是的！』</p>
<p>女郞打開車上的小窗子望着她的母親，她正跟在開動了車子在跑着。女郞頑皮地突起來：</p>
<p>『親愛的媽媽，不要跑呀！一個鐘頭以後我便回家了。』</p>
<p>車輪震耳地在街石上嚮着，牠們的聲音若沒了母親的回答。</p>

<h3>觀衆們掩耳盜鈴的政策和明星們所戴的假面具（上）</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>美國總統林肯曾說過：一個人萬萬不能永久的愚弄大衆的。這句話呢，大致是不錯的，但他却對於人的心理，還沒有透澈的了解。他沒有調查過，天下有多多少少的人是永久想着法子自己愚弄自己，或是故意呌人家來愚弄他們。這種人你要是把他們的迷夢喚醒了，或是把他們的幻景揭破了，他們就悲傷自悼了。世界人這種人到底有多少，是沒有統計的，但是有人竟大胆地說，凡是先生太太們，祇爲他們有幾個錢的，他們就情願買付粉紅色的眼鏡戴戴的。空虛，幻想，和輝煌，是逃避現實的途徑。雖然蘇俄的作家，竭力地描寫現實，但是大衆的天性，仍舊是喜歡情願看最好看的，聽最好聽的，相信最好的丨丨那些並不必全是事實丨丨而對於他們所崇拜的偶像，尤是如此。</p>
<p>葛雷泰嘉賓到底怎樣的神秘？怎樣的神秘起來的？說來亦很好笑。據她的親信人說，她在剛到美國的第一天，新聞記者們去見她，但她因爲語言的關係，一句話說不出來，她就簡直地不開口了。他們覺得這位瑞典女郞不同凡響，就加了她一個「神秘女郞」的頭銜。這個頭銜是眞金做的，葛雷泰不久亦從她的銀行賬上發覺了。於是她就益發裝做得神秘萬狀。而觀衆們呢，亦覺得她越神秘越好，所以葛雷泰就不能不維持她的神秘，因爲她的地位，就是建築在這神秘的空虛幻想上的。到底嘉賓神秘不神秘呢？恐怕牛肉餅裏有些什麽，還比她神秘得多哩。到了現在，要是電影刊物裏所登載的不够神秘，她的一般影迷所投的稿，就補足了它的不够，而最易招致大衆反對的，就是宣佈嘉賓並無與人差別的地方，她亦是一只眼睛看着大衆心醉於她的神秘而莫名其妙，一只眼睛看着售票處的進欵興旺而私心竊喜也。</p>
<p>關於一般明星們的婚姻事件，大衆對於他們亦常常存着許多虛構的幻想。卽以安哈婷而論，她自從和她的丈夫巴尼斯脫離婚之後，她的地位就受了很大的影響。因爲她以前所用的宣傳品裏面，總有些說到他們的婚姻怎樣的美滿，怎樣的可以百年偕老，作好萊塢全體的模範等等。當然等到後來婚姻破裂，眞相畢露的時候，就是素來醉心於她的一般影迷，尤其以家庭婦女爲甚，幻像消逝的日子。珍妮蓋諾和貝克的離婚，亦和以上所說的差不多。先前大家都拿珍妮當作一個小鳥依人，和善可親的好女郞的，到了那時亦都明白了珍妮亦有古怪倔强的地方。因此她的地位，亦就受了相當的影響。幸而她有幾張好片子，維持了她和觀衆們的情感。但是知道珍妮的各種毛病的，並不是一般觀衆，而是好萊塢的當局的。不久之前，我們聽到了某某影界聞人將要離婚的消息。我們以爲自己是局內人，無妨將這事的內容和親密的朋友們談談。豈知他們聽了這個眞實的內容，非但不說一聲謝字，反而被他們認爲造謠生事了。有一位很聰明的旁聽者說道：「請你不要講那種事吧。我情願保持着那個幻想，使之永久不滅，因爲那就是我所要逃避慘酷事實的唯一法門也。」這就是大衆們情願掩耳盜鈴，避免現實的辦法了。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「牧國之王」</h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>King　of　the　Wild　Horses　丨卡爾登丨</p>
<p>這是一部以馬爲主角的影片。</p>
<p>本來這不能算是奇事，當發現了一匹可以演戲的馬，好像有了一隻可以演戲的狗一樣，製片家可以視爲奇珍至寶，因爲藉着牠可以搏取觀衆們獵奇的心理。奇奇琳丁丁，或者是湯密格斯的馬，不都是曾經哄動一時乖巧的動物嗎？</p>
<p>人的身體已經成爲商品，何况中動物？</p>
<p>正因爲有了這一匹名呌獵士的馬，正因爲這一匹馬有驚人的技能，於是編劇者，導演者，攝影者，都爲了這一匹馬而動員，更支配了許多演員去替牠做配角。一切都很單純，什麽都是爲了一匹馬。</p>
<p>假使認爲那一個冒充的官吏來藉故訛詐人民乃是暴露了當地的政治組織的不良，那無論如何是無理由的故甚其詞，原來西部影片就常有這樣的一套。</p>
<p>我們在其中不會得着什麽新的理解，有的祇是馬的跳躍，和那酋長之子的驍勇。至於電影藝術，那在這理是談不到的。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「陷落的靈魂」</h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>「陷落的靈魂」是月明公司最近的作品，雖然內容還是那麽的幼稚，而不能使我們滿意，但在形態方面，確有着不少的進步，這是我們對於一個小公司所應鼓勵的一點。</p>
<p>本來在這社會經濟破壞之中，工人生活的不穩固，早已成爲無可諱言的事實，但是造成工人生活不穩的原因，乃是屬於整個社會組織的嚴重問題，决不是導演者所指出的那一個陷害靈魂的妖魔丨女人丨雖然女人有時也是破壞人類生活律的一種。這裏導演者不能指出工人生活破產的重大原因，而祇用一個女人來代表一切，亦未免有避重就輕之嫌，同時爲了意識不準確，關於劇情自然很少有力的發展，綜計所給觀衆的印像，祗不過是「女人不是好東西」而已！</p>
<p>導演的支配手腕，也嫌不够，如美娜携帶着箱籠的突如其來，而沒有詳細的介紹，如胡妻遷居而不至獄中通知胡飛，必至買餅而後相會，諸如此類的漏洞很多。但也有些很精彩的地方，如小飛病中狂風暴雨的一幕，確是十分逼眞。尤其是用漏屋中的破雨傘，而反寫舞塲中的舞傘，以舞塲中的吃咖啡，而反映胡妻的飲路茶，這都是很好的手法，而値得贊揚的地方。不過光綫的黑暗，確爲本片最大的污點！（下略）</p>
<h3>觀「陷落的靈魂」</h3>
<p>— 後逸民</p>
<p>「陷落的靈魂」描寫一個交際花的浪漫斯，的確，在故事的裏面，把都巿中的罪惡，紙醉金迷一切的一切，都不客氣的描寫出來，它告訴我們都巿中是這樣的萬惡，指示我們還是各人安分守已吧？不要作非非之想，否則便要誤入岐途，不知伊於胡底呢！</p>
<p>不過，劇本的編寫，太零亂了，太散漫了，始終沒有一幕能够抓住觀衆的心理而極度的緊張，儘是平淡的一幕幕表演。至於導演的導演技巧似還不够，所以全劇的演出，沒有什麽變化的地方，老是一幕幕同樣的鏡頭。</p>
<p>佈景因爲利用大部分的外鏡，像都巿和鄕村，在上海一帶攝取，所以很節省，並沒有多少的佈景需用，不過使我們失望遙，幾幕內景的佈景似乎太馬虎了，甚至有許多不合邏輯的地方。</p>
<p>演員的表演平平，並沒有特出的地方，因爲劇情的散漫，劇中人的中心人物的分散，更使各人不能充分的表演。比較的還是王飛娟吧，她飾胡飛的妻子，表演得比較深刻一些，大體說來，小公司的出品「陷落的靈魂」還可說是一張水平綫的國產片呢！</p>
<h3>法郞却通的戀愛</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>直到現在止，法郞却通曾戀愛過兩次。他和第二次的對手，訂了婚已經有數年了。可是因爲對手的她是個很有希望的女演員，假使他們結婚了，無疑毀滅了她的光明之前途，所以他只得忍耐着，爲她將來計，和她離別了。</p>
<p>自從這可悲的插話被人知道了後，法郞却通就大大地取得了各方面的同情，並且他的名聲亦就因此而增高了。</p>
<p>成爲問題之這對手的女性，現在他還嚴守秘密，不肯公開出來。但是有許多人說，大槪是薛爾維亞薛妮云。</p>
<h3>麗琳哈蕙的「出水芙蓉」</h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>這一個「出水芙蓉」LoveNeverAgain片子，它就是用諷刺的手法，來討論這男子好色的問題的。</p>
<p>一羣受了女人委屈的男子漢，對於美色實在有些厭倦了，憑着一時的勇氣，一同跑到海上去，發誓不再和異性親近了，起初呢？大家合唱着「和戀愛永別」的歌曲，倒是抱着十二分决心的，但是一天一天的過下去，大家就漸漸感着性的飢渴了，於是時常發生幻想，一個個都要變成瘋漢快了，這時候，千巧萬巧，忽然在海面上發現着一位身御浴衣的絕色美人。這一朶又嬌又嫩的出水芙蓉，給那班日夜渴望着女性的男子漢看見，那能無動於中？以後的事情，也用不着我再來說下去了。</p>
<p>這個片子，是麗琳哈蕙主演的，現已定於十八日（星期三）在本埠南京大戲院公映。</p>
<h3>銀色雜談</h3>
<p>— 白顰</p>
<p>管他「爲藝術而犧牲」是眞是假，但是，影評先生總得寬恕她們，往往見到在評片時附寫着「×××不惜犧牲肉體供人：：：」式的主見語。這是不當的，因爲拍攝肉感的一幕，雖然她有權力可以「不願」（也只有少數女星可以如此）但負責却要由編劇者和導演去負責的。她們不過是一個「無力反抗」的可憐者罷了！</p>
<p>固然，「肉感片」不是時代所需要的，抨擊亦所應該，但不要誤敲了傀儡的頭才好。算賬應該找「幕後人」算賬。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>公主三十日(Thirty-Day　Princess)（五）</h3>
<p>— 金鵲</p>
<p>去訪問史密德夫人的，不止史博資伍德和兩個警察，還有許多新聞記者亦跟了去。其中有一個呌吉樂爾克的，就是麥迪生報館裏的記者。他們跟到那裏，史密德夫人告訴他們耐雪已經失踪了好幾天了。吉爾克是個很機警的新聞記者。他從耐雪的屋子裏，尋到了一張耐雪的照相他給史密德夫人看了，證明那就是耐雪自己。於是他就急運回到自己的報館裏，他認定他已得到了獨一的驚人消息了。「原來那個加泰琳娜公主並不是什麽公主」，他告訴麥迪生說。「格萊興那裏的，是一個失踪的蘭因耐雪。她是一個女伶，現在假扮了公主，去帮助格萊興發行公債劵！」麥迪生還是疑信參半的，不敢回以唯否。不過他亦承認吉爾克拿的那張照相，確亦與加泰琳娜十二分的相像。後來他對着吉爾克道：「不過我是親自認識公主的。還有一點，公主是坐了輪船進口的，是不是？」吉爾克道：「公主雖是坐了輪船進口的，但像從前一樣，她亦可以進了防疫島，而不能上岸也。」於是他們商量了一個打折扣的辦法。他們先登一段蘭因耐雪失踪的消息，並且將她的照相，和她前一晚在夜總會裏所遺下的一個化妝盒子的照片登了出來。他們並且擬定了一個新聞標題，隱隱指着那裏面有許多黑幕和綁票的情形在內。麥迪生並且答應吉爾克夫儘量設法證明那加麥琳娜公主並不是什麽公主，而是蘭因耐雪。</p>
<p>等到明天那段新聞登了出來，並且有公主的化妝命盒子的照片，說那就是蘭因耐雪的，麥迪生自己看見了，竟死過去了好幾回。但是他亦沒有法子想了。那種夜總會裏的爭鬥：：：竟牽涉到公主的淸名：：：眞是件不可思議的事。格萊興看見了那段新聞，亦氣得臉都發紫了。他譴責耐雪，說她不顧自己的地位，私自和麥迪生發生愛情，並且和他跑進夜總會，危害到一切的任務，並且還不當心公主的私物，任意遺落在外面。但是事已如此，莫可挽回了。他們於是就定規出門遊歷一躺，暫時避避風頭。麥迪生聽見了公主出門去遊歷，當然是依依不舍，心痛如割，但是等到他到了車站去送行的時候，他更得到了一種意外的痛苦。因爲火車正在開行的時候，有一個尼古拉斯公爵趕到了車站。麥迪生打聽了，原來那尼古斯公爵就是公主的未婚夫。尼古拉斯要和公主一同出去遊歷，但是公主不要他去。他們爭執了起來。格萊興亦未便强迫耐雪。他並且知道尼古拉斯的嘴，是很散漫的恐怕一同去了，於他的計劃有所不利，這時吉爾克亦在車站上，他看見了尼古拉斯和公主的爭執，就立即將尼古拉斯包圍了起來。他問着尼古拉斯許多話，要想探聽些眞實內容，但是他却在有意無意之中，使尼古拉斯相信了公主已是變了，或者公主竟不是以前的公主，亦未可知。（未完）</p>

<h3>Strictly Prevent Cholera</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>The weather is extremely hot this summer. The Yangtze River basin and the provinces of Henan and Shandong have been suffering from prolonged drought, and epidemics are spreading, creating many dangers. Take cholera, for example, which has always been a prevalent disease in our country during the summer, but the cyclical nature of its intense outbreaks is unpredictable. Therefore, during the summer, preventive measures must not be delayed and must not be relaxed on the grounds that there were few cases of true cholera last year.</p>
<p>Just three years ago, cholera was prevalent in twenty provinces and cities in our country, with 100,000 cases and more than 30,000 deaths. The severity of the disaster can be imagined. The fact that we were spared a true cholera outbreak last year may only be because it was in a passive latent state of a dormant cycle. To say that it will certainly not occur this year is too optimistic. According to the first announcement of the Shanghai Cholera Prevention Temporary Office, "Cholera vibrios with weak agglutinative properties were found three times in the river and pond water samples taken in May and June this year. This is very important for the study of cholera epidemics." News reports from Xuzhou indicate that the tiger plague is rampant, with deaths occurring every day, and coffin shops are unable to meet the demand. If it is not quickly suppressed and spreads to other places, the consequences will be dire.</p>
<p>According to experts, cholera generally spreads in two ways: one is explosive, caused by drinking water contaminated with bacteria, and the other is prolonged, transmitted by mosquitoes and flies coming into contact with bacteria. We are fortunate to live in large cities with tap water for drinking and vaccinations for protection. The chances of being infected are naturally not as high as in poor rural areas. On the other hand, the poor and suffering people in the interior mostly live in thatched huts and shacks, where mosquitoes and flies congregate and live together. Moreover, the water they drink is mostly taken from wells, rivers, and ponds. Transmission is easy, and infection is common. Furthermore, the weather is extremely dry this year, and the rivers and wells are shallow and silty, with turbid water. Based on common sense, the growth of cholera bacteria should be even faster than usual. Therefore, preventive measures cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in 1931 (of the Republic of China), the Yangtze River and Huai River Canal basins were flooded, and sporadic cholera cases were seen in the autumn of that year, continuing into the early spring of the following year. Fortunately, the Disaster Relief Committee's preventive measures were effective, and the damage was reduced. This year, the rivers in eastern Hebei and northern Hubei have risen sharply, and the danger is extreme. The tragedy of being submerged is almost unavoidable. According to our experience, epidemics always follow floods. Those who die from epidemics are often more numerous than those who die from drowning or starvation. The cholera situation in the disaster areas in the future is extremely worrying. It is hoped that those in charge of water conservancy and public health will make plans as soon as possible to prevent the spread. As for the northwestern provinces, the territory is vast, and transportation is obstructed. Whenever there is a severe drought, epidemics are rampant, and people and livestock die in large numbers. During the cholera epidemic of 1932 (of the Republic of China), the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Suiyuan all used airplanes to transport large quantities of vaccines from Beiping and Shanghai for prevention. It is heard that in April of this year, the Central Health Administration planned to establish a Northwest Epidemic Prevention Office to handle work such as serum vaccines nearby. The drought this summer is unprecedented. The need for a Northwest Epidemic Prevention Office is even more urgent.</p>
<p>In recent years, although our country's public health事业 cannot be compared with those of the great powers, it has also made some progress. For example, the Municipal Health Bureau and the Seaport Quarantine Administration in this city are quite serious about epidemic prevention work and can be taken as examples. However, the health administration in various provinces in the interior is still immature, and the poor and suffering people are mostly clueless about methods to prevent cholera and other seasonal epidemics. Therefore, it depends on the central and local health administrators and social leaders to go deep into the people and work hard. We all know that to prevent cholera, we must pay attention to the cleanliness and epidemic prevention propaganda, the implementation of vaccine injections, the promotion of disinfection campaigns, and the establishment of isolation hospitals. However, if it is only limited to large cities or the upper classes, it is far from enough to be considered universal, and the essence of public health is lost. Therefore, the main object of a true public health事業 must be the lower classes of the people, and a popular method must be used to promote it extensively. Cholera is one of the most dangerous infectious diseases. When talking about the way to prevent it, one must start from within.</p>
<h3>Central National Government: Reports on Two Memorial Weeks, Ju Zheng: The Five-Power Constitution and the New Life Movement, Shao Yuanchong: The Spirit of Nationalism</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held the 193rd Memorial Week on the morning of the 16th. Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Li Ciwen, Wang Qi, Hong Ludong, Xiao Jishan, Xie Zuomin, Miao Peicheng, Liang Hancao, Ke Xinge, and all staff members, totaling approximately 600 people, attended. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting. Chen Lifu reported, stating that the Premier's creation of the Five-Power Constitution was derived from the path of human survival and evolution. It is the evolution of humanity for survival, passing through several stages to form the five functions of legislation, administration, judiciary, examination, and supervision, in order to maintain the entire social order. Therefore, the Five-Power Constitution not only establishes a system but also has the function of selecting and eliminating people through examination and supervision, which is more complete than the three-power system. In short, although the system is good, it still needs morality to maintain its foundation. Therefore, the promotion of the New Life Movement, advocating propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, is sufficient to remedy the shortcomings of the system. Currently, why are there shortcomings in the trial implementation of the five-power system? Most of them are due to unclear powers and functions, incomplete laws and regulations, and the gradual decline of morality. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the trial implementation process and does not mean that the Premier's Five-Power Constitution is imperfect. In short, we should urgently promote morality, because there is no political system that can be discussed without morality. After the speech, the meeting adjourned around 9 o'clock.

Shao Yuanchong presided over the meeting, led the attendees in paying respects, and delivered a report, stating that in engaging in the work of national rejuvenation, we should deeply understand the spirit of the Premier's nationalism. Its positive manifestations should be to strive from the basic work of consolidating the national foundation, promoting the progress of national politics, society, and culture. To complete this task, we must base ourselves on the Premier's spirit of education to cultivate independent knowledge, develop special abilities, and shoulder the responsibility of rejuvenating the nation. Its negative manifestations should be to fight for national survival in times of national crisis and have the spirit of self-sacrifice for the sake of benevolence. At the same time, we should have full faith in the constructive ability and the spirit of great men manifested in all aspects of our country's struggle history, such as politics, military affairs, society, and culture, to encourage ourselves to build the foundation for rejuvenating the nation and complete the responsibility of rejuvenating the nation.

<h3>Japanese Navy Decides: Demands to Divide Control of the Pacific: Will Abolish the Washington and London Treaties: Expand the Navy and Increase Air Force: Seize Hegemony Over a 2,000-Nautical-Mile Radius Circle</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The naval authorities are actively preparing for next year's naval disarmament conference. The meeting of the naval leadership, which opened at 11:00 a.m. this morning, decided on the following fundamental principles:</p>
<p>(1) Demand the revision of the Washington and London Treaties to establish a naval disarmament treaty that can preserve peace in East Asia and satisfy the sense of national defense security.</p>
<p>(2) Based on the right to equal armaments, change the total tonnage system to a restriction system, determine its maximum limit, and the amount of each type of warship within its scope should be freely decided by the country.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to fully implementing the established replenishment plan in the first and second items, increase the air force and expand its content to seize the naval power within a 2,000-nautical-mile radius circle centered on the Japanese archipelago and strengthen the national defense of the north.</p>
<p>(4) If the above plans are determined and prepared, Japan can ensure national security at any time in the event of an unexpected incident. (Japanese United News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British and American Representatives: Draft a Joint Statement: Explaining the Reasons for Postponing the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>(London) Davis and other members of the American naval delegation will return to New York on July 19th. The current stage of the British-American naval talks has ended. British and American representatives have drafted a joint statement explaining the reasons for postponing the continuation of the talks, which will probably be published tomorrow. It is reported that the postponement of the talks is because it is necessary to first inquire about Japan's views before continuing. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The news that the preliminary negotiations for the naval conference would be postponed until October has been confirmed here. According to the Daily Telegraph, the lack of progress in the preliminary negotiations is one of the reasons for the postponement. The differences between Britain and the United States regarding the tonnage of battleships and cruisers are as great as before, and the differences between Britain and France regarding submarines are also deep. Davis and the American government are greatly disappointed with the lack of results in the negotiations and the delay in the arrival of the Japanese representatives, and the Japanese representatives only have one naval officer. The conflict of opinions between France and Italy is also one of the reasons for the postponement. (National News dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The American delegation participating in the preliminary talks for the 1935 naval conference will depart for New York this Thursday. The preliminary naval talks have been postponed until October, apparently because the United States must wait for Britain to determine its action plan, and Britain's action plan must largely await talks with Italy and Japan's statement of its intentions to Britain before it can be determined. The instructions given to the American delegation are only to record and report to the government the proposals put forward by all parties. Without Britain's initiative, the American delegation cannot promote the progress of the negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Ambassador Matsudaira in England to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when negotiating with the United States, the British side put forward a concrete proposal, but Japan, the United States, and France were not prepared to propose countermeasures, and Japan and the United States did not agree with Britain on the date of the naval disarmament conference. Therefore, Davis, the American representative, is taking advantage of the summer vacation to return home once, resulting in the temporary suspension of the talks for next year's conference. Foreign Minister Simon of England, Ambassador Matsudaira of Japan, and representative Davis of the United States will meet on the 17th to mutually state the process of the talks and decide to suspend the talks before the end of October. The three countries will jointly issue a statement, which will be at 11:00 a.m. on the 17th in Japan. Foreign Minister Hirota immediately replied to Ambassador Matsudaira, saying that Japan was only involved in procedural issues at the preliminary talks and did not enter into substantive talks, so Colonel Iwashita, who was specially dispatched by the Navy, should arrive in England in September. There is no objection to suspending the talks before then. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement in Tokyo when the statement is issued in London and is currently in contact with the British side.

<p>(Tokyo) The meeting of the highest-ranking officers of the Japanese Navy, which decided on the Navy's attitude toward next year's naval disarmament conference, was held at the Admiral's official residence at 11:00 a.m. today.

First, Admiral Osumi stated the circumstances of his continued tenure in the current cabinet. Then, he explained the opinions on the new cabinet's national policy requested by the government from the Navy, which were submitted to Prime Minister Okada as follows: (1) Strive to restore the right to self-defense in the naval disarmament conference and withdraw from unfavorable treaties. (2) Establish a policy toward Manchuria. (3) Entrust the Navy with ensuring the League of Nations mandate territories. (4) Implement the national defense replenishment plan with 1936 as the target. Afterwards, Bureau Chief Yoshida of the Naval Affairs Bureau reported on the progress of the preliminary talks at the naval disarmament conference. After earnest discussions, the results were based on the following fundamental naval principles: (1) Abolition of the ratio system for each type of warship. (2) Establishment of the right to national self-defense. (3) Establishment of a sense of national security. (4) Should withdraw from unfavorable treaties and revise existing treaties. (5) Strive to conclude reasonable treaties that prevent heavily armed countries from autonomously reducing attacks on others. The countermeasures for dealing with the naval disarmament conference were submitted to the government, and this point will be clearly indicated to the people, urging the government to implement the empire's claims with national unity. After unanimous agreement, the meeting adjourned at 1:20 p.m. The officers who came to Beijing are scheduled to return to their posts on the 17th. (Electric News dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Eastern European Pact: Germany Tends to Oppose: Fears France and Russia Will Control European Affairs</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Eastern Locarno Pact, for which the British ambassador to Germany formally sought German consent on Friday, has now aroused opposition in areas familiar with its content, on the grounds that the conclusion of the pact is not only insufficient to prevent war, but also sufficient to promote it. The semi-official organ "Foreign Political Review" published an article today stating that the draft agreement drawn up by British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Barthou is nothing less than a "completely military pact." The newspaper added, "The Eastern Locarno Pact does not aim to consult with each other to resolve armed conflict in the event of difficulties in the first chapter, but only promotes mutual assistance, which shows that the premise of the pact is military in nature, which is enough to cause the world to be shocked and thoughtful. Moreover, there are many conflicts between the Eastern Locarno Pact and the League of Nations Covenant, because the League of Nations Covenant is a guarantee of peace, but now it is replaced by France's military alliance in Eastern Europe, which is sufficient to promote rapid and effective action. Once an accident occurs in the future, France can determine right and wrong and handle everything on its own. Then various newly concluded guarantee covenants can be destroyed at will, and the so-called peaceful reconciliation without resorting to force will be more difficult to follow in the future. Even the little ability left in the League of Nations Council today will be deprived of it in the future, and there will be no possibility of existence even in ideals. It is difficult for Germany to return to Geneva, where there is no guarantee of equal treatment, in such a settlement that promotes war. Moreover, the so-called issue of League of Nations reform seems to be a thing of the past in the eyes of the initiators of the Eastern Locarno Pact, and the League of Nations thereafter will also become a mere appendage under the control of French hegemony. But this is not just empty talk. It can be seen that it is not wrong to use recent events as evidence. The accession of Soviet Russia to the League of Nations is a one-handed affair of the three powers. No meetings were convened to discuss it in advance, nor was the consent of other member states sought, because they knew in advance that other countries would oppose it. However, since they are all member states, they should at least be given the opportunity to speak. Therefore, in the future, whenever any important event occurs in Europe, it can be handled by France and Russia in consultation. Therefore, this kind of policy is no longer an organized evolution, but only knows how to use political and military actions to create various "faits accomplis." (National News dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Wheat Crop Failure: US to Change Control Measures</h3>
<p>(Washington) Following today's predictions of a poor grain harvest, the United States may abandon restrictions on grain production next year. According to experienced observers here, cotton and wheat have been severely affected by drought. It is unlikely that there will be further reductions in cultivated land. The predicted surplus of cotton and wheat will fall below the warning line. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) believes that the emergency period for restricting grain is coming to an end. It may then adjust the production of flour and cotton. Agriculture Secretary Wallace stated that if the grain harvest is as poor as expected, wheat production will no longer be restricted next year. The AAA may allow for increased acreage. It is reported that the government is currently studying how many acres of land should be restored to cultivation so as not to hinder rising prices and the AAA's grain restriction program. It seems certain that there will be no need to control livestock production next year. The drought has greatly reduced forage, which will naturally limit livestock production. Since the AAA's cotton acreage restriction fell short of its target by one million bales, Congress passed the revolutionary Bankhead Act, imposing a cotton tax on excess imports to limit cotton production to ten million bales. For nearly a century, American domestic and foreign policies have been influenced by wheat production. Wheat production is also a litmus test for the New Deal's economic theories of production control and farmer cooperation. The government hopes to cooperate with other countries to restrict wheat production under the London Agreement by limiting acreage, and to subsidize exporters to develop markets across the Pacific. This trend towards national self-sufficiency has been accepted by farmers cultivating 77% of the land. 550,000 farmers have signed contracts, abandoning 7,595,000 acres. American taxpayers have also paid millions in taxes for the grain restriction program to subsidize farmers. (15th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Italian Ship Recovers 12,000 Gold Bars and £135,000 in Gold Coins</h3>
<p>The Italian ships Artiglio and Rialto, which have been salvaging gold and silver from the British company's mail ship Egypt, which sank in 1922, have recovered 12,000 gold bars, £135,000 in gold coins, and 40 tons of silver. The ship has now returned here loaded with grain. According to today's news, the divers found the gold and silver storage of the Egypt to be empty. After checking the amount of gold and silver carried by the Egypt on the day of the sinking, it is believed that there are still 150 gold bars and 30 silver bars on the ship, possibly fallen into the cargo hold. Therefore, it is planned to drill through the cargo hold to find them. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>

It is hoped that next week's weather will allow the world's largest balloon, sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the US Army Air Corps, to ascend into space according to the original detailed plan, in order to reach a distance of 16 miles above the ground. The balloon has a volume of three million cubic feet and can carry about one ton of scientific instruments. All instruments for recording scientific data are manufactured by the Wright-Fairfield Air Corps factory and laboratory, under the direction of Colonel Stevens. Colonel Stevens is skilled in aerial photography, so cameras are very important for reconnaissance recording and saving high-altitude scientific research work. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Silver Prices and China</h3>
<p>(London) Wilkins, chairman of the Currency Policy Committee of the British Textile Manufacturers Association, wrote to the Manchester Guardian today, denying the claim that high silver prices cause prices in China to fall. He said that after silver prices rise, the rest of the world will prosper, and the demand for Chinese specialties such as silk and tea will also increase. In 1924, when the price of silver was 34 pence per ounce, Lancashire sold 293 million square yards of cloth to China. In 1931, when the price of silver fell to 13 pence per ounce, Lancashire's cloth sales to China decreased to 81 million square yards. The following year, 1932, when the price of silver was 18 pence per ounce, China purchased 125 million square yards of cloth from Lancashire. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Vienna in Darkness for Several Hours</h3>
<p>Vienna, the capital of Austria, was plunged into darkness for several hours this morning due to some bizarre act of revenge, with electricity, radio, telephone, and streetcars all shut down. It is widely believed that this was an action by the Communists to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the arson of the Vienna Palace of Justice. At midnight, Vienna's streetcars, suddenly encountering a world of darkness, were cut off from electricity and stopped on the tracks. All radio and broadcasting stations were silent. Most police stations were isolated due to telephone outages. After radio was restored this morning, the official explanation was that the main lines to Vienna were broken at the same time as a high-voltage power line outside the city was cut. Today, explosions occurred at the Central and Continental Hotels here, so the public believes that political action has not subsided. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>The Vienna Communist Party held a secret meeting in the Gartenless Forest to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the arson of the Vienna Palace of Justice. More than 1,000 people participated. Police and internal guards attempted to disperse the Communists. The Communists resisted strongly. Finally, the police opened fire several times, resulting in three deaths and twelve injuries. By the time reinforcements arrived, the Communists had dispersed, and only one leader was arrested. (16th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>General Strike in San Francisco: Approximately 35,000 Workers on Strike; About 1.5 Million People Affected; The Second General Strike in American History</h3>
<p>The general strike in San Francisco began at 8:00 AM this morning. Yesterday, striking workers rioted after looting food stores, resulting in troops using bayonets to kill one striking worker. The Washington government is constantly exchanging information with San Francisco and communicating with President Roosevelt by radio. Police and the National Guard have increased their defenses. The Federal Second Army is stationed locally, and if the California troops are insufficient, the Federal troops will maintain order. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>San Francisco began a general strike here at 8:00 AM this morning. This is the first time a general strike has been held in the United States. The strike workers' steering committee made the final preparations last night and decided on the following measures: (1) Food and gasoline in the city will be sold on a limited basis with coupons. (2) Organize "union police" in accordance with discipline to work with regular police to prevent violence. (3) Try to get all non-union workers, about 50,000, to join the strike. (4) The union authorities have designated 17 restaurants as public dining places. (5) Many companies have reserved entire floors of rooms in nearby hotels so that employees who cannot return home due to the public transport strike can stay temporarily in the hotels. In addition, strike pickets are blocking trucks carrying food into the city outside the city and prohibiting violence. There is a growing sense of food shortage in the city. California Governor Merriam has transferred 2,000 National Guard troops to San Francisco and declared that he will use troops to protect trucks carrying food into the city. The entire city is virtually under martial law. Washington has declared that the government will not interfere in the strike unless ordered by President Roosevelt. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>San Francisco is in a state of tension. The second general strike in history is scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM this morning. It is estimated that more than 1.5 million people will be affected. Two thousand defense troops from California are now heading to the port area from their camp 250 miles south of here, so it is rumored today that martial law will be declared. The defense troops are under secret orders to rush south with their equipment, hoping to arrive here by 10:00 AM. It is estimated that between 30,000 and 45,000 workers went on strike on Monday, and other workers will join the strike in the next few days. Several thousand others will have to strike due to the shutdown of most industries and the lack of transportation. Senior executives and other non-union members are in a very difficult situation. If they move to hotels near their offices, they will have no food. If they stay at home, they will not be able to work. By Wednesday, 150,000 people may be on strike. Grocery companies and retailers will all be shut down due to traffic disruption. Businessmen's losses will be millions of dollars a day. Negotiations between the Waterfront Employers Association, dockworkers, and sailors have been ineffective. The desolation and desolation of the streets of San Francisco is unprecedented in the city's history. Occasionally, a car speeds past on the streets, attracting attention and private discussions about where the gasoline came from. Streetcar and railway transportation will be completely shut down at 10:00 AM. A special gas station is open as usual. Doctors can purchase gasoline here with special permission. Grocery stores are still open on Sundays, which is the last chance for residents to buy food, but when they close, there are few canned goods left on the shelves. Governor Merlin has ordered patrol teams to drive trucks to various parts of the port, but few vehicles have arrived. Most housewives are stocking up on food in preparation for a long-term siege. Although the union allows special transportation for hospitals and health departments, most of the elderly and infants are inconvenienced by the lack of fuel and hot water in homes, hotels, and apartments. Fresh meat is no longer available due to the butcher's strike, and there is no source of fresh eggs. Fresh milk for babies is only available at hospitals and farms ten to fifteen miles away. Vegetable prices are soaring, and prices of all items are skyrocketing. The theater workers' union will also join the strike this morning, so all industries will be shut down. The state government's troops and police officers are patrolling the key coastal areas of San Francisco, but no riots have occurred on Sunday. The labor unrest has not yet been resolved. The whole city is filled with an unnatural atmosphere of desolation, as the residents of the metropolis are anxiously awaiting future developments. The general strike in eastern San Francisco, originally scheduled to take place on Tuesday morning, will cause cities such as Akron, Hickley, Haywood, Abenai, and others to become dead cities like San Francisco after 10:00 AM this morning. The printing industry union strike has been avoided, otherwise it will cause newspapers to temporarily suspend publication. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>After a period of quiet in the San Francisco labor unrest, riots broke out on the riverfront again today. Mobs used trucks as cover to throw stones at soldiers and police. Although they were driven away, they did not disperse. The soldiers and police then opened fire, resulting in several deaths and injuries. One person attempted to seize a soldier's rifle and was stabbed with a bayonet. At the same time, police patrol cars rushed to various places to provide assistance and were very busy. A total of ten strikers were arrested. In Oakland, mobs smashed the glass windows of food stores and looted. Many stores were closed for fear of being looted and did not do business. The general strike in San Francisco tomorrow, which will involve 150,000 workers, is scheduled to begin at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning. The central army will maintain order in the city when the strike is realized. San Francisco Mayor Rossi said to the public today that he would put down the strike and said that there were extremists in it who were determined to revolt. The police chief has recruited 500 special armed police officers and a cavalry squad. President Roosevelt is paying close attention to this matter. If the situation becomes too serious, the President may shorten his trip. Residents rushed to purchase food and other items to obtain sufficient supplies, so that the inventories of many stores were sold out today. Some stores are now limiting the quantity that customers can purchase. Many restaurants have closed their doors because they cannot obtain supplies. The strike committee today asked the strikers not to interfere with the supply of milk, bread, meat, etc. needed by hospitals, so hospitals can be unaffected by the general strike. The largest force of dockworkers is now concentrated in the port, wanting to gain control of the port's employment. Most local newspapers oppose the strike. The dockworkers' demands are: (1) Recognition of the union as an employment management agency. (2) A 30-hour work week. (3) $1 per hour wage. (4) Overtime pay of $1.50 per hour. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>In Houston today, dockworkers on strike and non-striking workers clashed on a ship in the port. Gunshots were fired, resulting in the deaths of three non-union black dockworkers on the spot. One other person was seriously injured. In addition, two non-union black dockworkers and one white dockworker belonging to the union were slightly injured. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Lions and Tigers in the General Strike</h3>
<p>The director of the San Francisco Zoo recently stated that if the lions and tigers in the zoo do not receive their daily food due to the strike, he will drive the zoo's elephants through the streets and into the meat market. But today, with police protection, the director of the zoo used municipal trucks to load 800 pounds of horse meat and break through the strikers' blockade to enter the zoo. General Johnson of the National Recovery Administration is now in San Francisco, asking all parties to accept arbitration and saying that anyone can get together to resolve the strike.

<h3>A Madman in Shenyang Breaks into the US Consulate General</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) At noon today, an unidentified person, holding a bayonet, first removed the wooden sign in front of the US Consulate General and discarded it on the side of the road. He then entered the consulate and tried to break into the office. He was seen by US Vice Consul Hull, who threw a chair at him. Hearing the noise, the consulate staff came to help. The rioter then circled the consulate, trying to escape, and finally jumped over the wall and fled. The US Consulate General immediately notified the nearby Japanese Consulate General. Soon, many police officers arrived. Currently, the Manchu police and Japanese military police are cooperating to search for the rioter. The US authorities believe that the rioter must be a madman and do not want to attach special importance to the act of destroying the wooden sign in front of the consulate.

<h3>Two Cases of Corpses in Trunks in the UK</h3>
<p>(London) Local newspapers are now full of two cases of corpses in trunks in the United States. A month ago, the body of a young pregnant woman without limbs was found in a trunk in the luggage room of the Whitechapel station. Later, two legs were found on King's Cross Street, but the head and arms are still missing. Yesterday, police searched a hotel in Whitechapel to solve the suspicion of the disappearance of the dancer Kay Yi. Then, the body of a woman was found in a large trunk. It was found to be the missing dancer. There were also clothes with blood stains and a hammer in the trunk, which is thought to be the murder weapon. A waiter at the hotel was questioned by the police once after the dancer Kay Yi disappeared. Now, this person is also missing. The authorities are currently hunting him down.

<h3>Saigon Silver Coins Re-coined Without Melting Fee</h3>

In order to facilitate the re-coining of silver and implement the abolition of the tael system, it should be approved. The Saigon silver coins sent by the Banque de l'Indochine for re-coining this time should not be considered to be too mixed. The standard for calculating the re-coining of new coins should be based on the amount of pure silver contained in the coins. It is not appropriate to apply the example of requesting the minting of old coins. All the melting fees collected by the mint should be sent to the Central Bank for distribution.

<h3>Peng Zhaoxian Discusses the Current Situation in Xinjiang Province</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Peng Zhaoxian will go to Jiangxi tomorrow. According to him, the current situation in Xinjiang is as follows: (1) Ma Zhongying is a young military officer, only 23 years old, and very capable. Unfortunately, he is too ambitious. Currently, his troops have retreated to a county in southern Xinjiang, with only a little over a thousand people left. It would be easy for Sheng Shicai to disband his troops. (2) The pseudo-government organized by Hui people in Shule and Shufu in southern Xinjiang has virtually dissolved due to the arrival of Sheng Shicai's troops. Its leader, Kabir Timur, has now fled to the border area between Xinjiang and Tibet. (3) Although Xinjiang has a complex mix of ethnic groups, the people have great respect for the central government. (4) Because his father is 73 years old, he is unwilling to serve in Xinjiang. He has resigned from the post of Director of the Civil Affairs Department to President Wang, but it was not approved. He will have to submit his resignation again when he meets Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi this time. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Tang Youren, Under Wang Jingwei's Orders, Urges Huang Fu to Return North. Yin Tong, Persuaded by Huang, May Withdraw His Resignation.</h3>
<p>Hangzhou News: Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Mogan Mountain by car via the Jing-Hang (Nanjing-Hangzhou) National Highway on the evening of the 13th. He switched to a rattan sedan chair to ascend the mountain, carrying Premier Wang Jingwei's order to visit Huang Yingbai at his private residence at number 509. Later, Yin Tong also arrived, and they engaged in secret talks until after 11:00 PM. Tang and Yin returned to the Railway Hotel together, with Tang staying in room 116. At 7:20 AM on the 14th, Huang Fu went to the Mogan Mountain Public Welfare Association to handle association affairs in his own rattan sedan chair and then visited Tang at the Railway Hotel. They talked until 11:00 AM and then went to Huang's residence for lunch. After lunch, they had further lengthy discussions. Tang and Yin left Huang's residence at 9:30 PM to return to their lodgings to rest. When reporters visited, Tang stated that the reasons for Huang's delay in going north were: (1) the weather was too hot; (2) the North China issue had been largely resolved after the traffic problem was addressed, so Huang was staying in the mountains to avoid the heat. As a result of my (Tang referring to himself) meeting with Huang, Premier Wang hopes that he will return to the north as soon as possible to preside over the North China political situation. Huang intends to go after the weather cools down, so it is impossible to force him. The date of his departure from the mountain is uncertain. The entire North China issue should return to a normal diplomatic and ordinary political state as soon as possible; otherwise, we feel pain, and they are constantly suspicious, which is detrimental to both sides internationally. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the war zone and other issues are not as serious as the rumors suggest and need to be referred to Chairman Huang for handling, which Huang can resolve after going north. Abolishing the Tanggu Truce is not an easy matter, and the central government has not yet discussed it. The rumor that negotiations will begin at the beginning of next month is probably not true. Chairman He (Jian) has returned from the southwest, and the leaders of the southwest have a better understanding of the central government's military and political aspects. Yin Tong's resignation, after Huang's personal persuasion, will return to the north in the coming days and may withdraw his resignation. Tang went down the mountain at 5:00 AM this morning (15th), took a car back to Hangzhou, and returned to Nanjing to report. (15th)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Taiwanese Residents' General Assembly. This Year Has Seen a Large Increase in Taiwanese Coming to Xiamen. Japanese Business Has Also Seen a Rapid Advance.</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondent: The Xiamen Taiwanese Association is organized by Taiwanese Japanese residents. Its scope was expanded last year, and it holds a general assembly (members' meeting) once a year. This year's second general assembly was held on July 8th. Those present that day included Tsukamoto Takeshi, the Japanese Consul stationed in Xiamen; Suigen Tsunehachi, the Deputy Consul of Justice; Ogawa Kaname, the Chief of the Japanese Police Station; Kato, the Director of the Xiamen Branch (Japanese people set up a police branch in Xiamen without authorization, exercising police power over residents, which has no basis in the treaty and has not been revoked despite repeated protests from our side); Sano, the patrol chief; and consular staff detectives. In addition, there were Japanese resident members, Taiwanese association members, and so-called committee members from the various Taiwanese districts in Xiamen. During the meeting, Shoji, the Japanese principal of the Asahi Ei School in Xiamen, reported on the teaching facilities of the Asahi Ei School, stating that the school had 602 students, including 348 boys and 254 girls, all taught in Japanese, with instruction in loyalty to the emperor and love of country (the Japanese Empire). Shoji also stated that, of these 602 students, about 150 were Chinese children, in addition to Taiwanese Japanese residents. Shoji also said that the Chinese students in the class would benefit the Taiwanese people in Xiamen in the future. Tsukamoto Takeshi then gave a speech, stating that last year, due to repeated political changes in the local area, they focused on foreign affairs and had no time to take care of internal affairs. Now that foreign affairs are in the past, they will focus on organizing internal affairs. According to the association's report on the economic situation, last year's income included 9,900 yuan in membership fees, 6,064 yuan in foreign firm fees, 3,666 yuan in clerical fees and guarantee handling fees, and 10,402 yuan in public security maintenance fees (this item is the 1,000 yuan per month that the Taiwanese Association pays to our Public Security Bureau to offset the police tax for Taiwanese residents. Therefore, all residents</p>
<p>shops, households, and stores with registered signs in Xiamen do not pay police taxes, resulting in a huge loss to the Public Security Bureau). This year's budget has increased membership fees to 27,108 yuan, an increase of 19,608 yuan, a two-fold increase, indicating the large number of Taiwanese people newly arriving in Xiamen. Foreign firm assessment fees have also increased to 11,350 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan over last year, also a two-fold increase, indicating the rapid progress of Japanese business in Xiamen recently. On the expenditure side, the original education fee for the Asahi Ei School of 5,000 yuan has been increased to 7,000 yuan, and there are two new expenses: (1) District security affairs fee (according to Taiwanese people, this year, in Xiamen, autonomous district security is established according to the areas of streets and villages without the permission of our official authorities. The current form is in opposition to our autonomous district security associations); (2) Confidential fee. It is unknown what the so-called confidential matters are. (July 13th)</p>
<h3>National Army Advances on Shicheng and Ningdu in Three Routes. Baishui Has Been Captured, and Shicheng Is Being Attacked from Yiqian.</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondent: It was recently learned from Guangchang that when the three-route army advanced south towards Baishui Town, 40 li from the city, the □□□ division came into contact with bandits.

The national army is currently building roads from Guangcheng to this place and defensive works to enter Shicheng from Yiqian. It is found that Shicheng and Changting Ruijin are intertwined. If this step is taken, the pseudo-central government will disintegrate. (July 15th)</p>
<h3>Inspection Notes from the Northwest: Relics of Natural and Man-made Disasters. Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Geng Ya</h3>
<p>On the 29th at dawn, we departed from Chang Liushui. The wheels of the car became mired in the sand at Shawo (commonly known as the Dead Baby Pit), even more so than yesterday. When the wheel was lifted, the sand flowed down like water being poured from a waterwheel. We made a sloping path up to reduce the weight of the car and agreed to walk. After 30 li, we reached the top of the slope. There was a temple called Doumu Gong. We rested for two hours before the horse-drawn carriage arrived. After strong winds, stone rods often appear in the sand pits nearby, shaped like winding, broken snakes. The villagers call them "earth dragon bones" and say they can cure male hernias and irregular menstruation in women. The temple master sells them for a good profit. Upon examining them, their shape and texture were like animal bones, and their color was similar to lime, but they were very hard and had fine holes in them. I suspect that they were fossilized bones. The claim that they "cure diseases like magic" is just a false statement by the temple master to collect money. The palace was built in the twelfth year of the Qing Yongzheng era by the Zhongwei Diaoshapo Tea Society. It was repaired once by Ji Hongchang's troops and is still brand new today. Travelers rarely see springs for dozens of miles. After drinking here, everyone felt revitalized and grateful for the kindness. There is also no water in the temple, so they have to transport it back and forth, a journey of 40 li in total. It is said that when the Qinghai army passed the temple on its way to aid Ningxia, the locals used 30 donkeys to transport water for drinking and forbade cooking and watering horses, yet still several donkeys died from exhaustion. This shows how precious water is.</p>
<p>After traveling another ten or so li, we arrived at Yishaoquan (One Spoon Spring) and stayed there. The wounded soldiers from Qinghai who had stayed here last night had not yet left. They were leaning on crutches, bandaged, crawling on their knees, each in a different state, all heartbreaking to see. They were being transported by camel teams, traveling at night and resting during the day, making it even more inconvenient. The weather was hot, and all the camel hair had fallen off, making them difficult to look at. There were only three families of residents, who had repeatedly suffered from the disasters of war and said that they would move to another place. The leaking rooms and broken sheds were all occupied by wounded soldiers, so we temporarily sat on stone piers in front of the door. Suddenly, we heard a soft sobbing sound. We saw a young orderly, ordered by the medical officer to find water, who had failed and been whipped, breaking his right arm, with blood flowing profusely, soaking his sleeve. The orderly was from Henan and was 14 years old. His father had died in military service in 1918, and his mother had remarried. At that time, he was nine years old. He joined the 15th Route Army and attended the disaster relief school in Luoyang. Later, he moved with the army to Ningxia. This spring, when Sun Dianying's army invaded the west, Ningxia province expanded the hospital's staff of wounded soldiers. The disaster relief school was dissolved, and the students had nowhere to go, so they were assigned to various hospitals. The younger ones were used as orderlies, and the older ones as medics. Later, when the wounded soldiers' hospital closed, the orphans lost their homes again. The orderly had no place to rely on. He followed the wounded soldiers of the Qing army returning to Qinghai but was unexpectedly injured along the way, which was very painful. As the orderly spoke, tears kept falling. Suddenly, a military officer arrived, and the orderly quickly wiped away his tears with his left palm and gave a standing salute. The officer seemed surprised that he did not raise his hand, glanced at him askance, and passed by. Many who heard this found the medical officer's cruelty strange, but how could they know that the poison of war was the cause of this? Since he was already the wife of a widower and the son of an orphan, and society was not a healthy organization, there was no way to educate and support these helpless people. Only then did we discover that similar or even worse situations existed. Is this really the fault of the medical officer alone?</p>
<p>Swift Yellow Goats (also known as Wild Goats)</p>
<p>The three families of residents at Yishao Spring all run inns. We initially stayed temporarily at the west store. At 4:00 PM, the wounded soldiers set off. The east store was cleaner, so we moved there. However, the owner of the west store, with a head wrapped in mourning cloth, confronted the owner of the east store, questioning him in vulgar language and spitting everywhere, which was unbearable to witness. Later, Su Yuanzhang's soldiers, through various persuasions and slightly threatening words, finally made her weep and leave. According to the two store owners, they were originally from the same family, but due to competition for livelihood, they did not hesitate to stage this tragedy. The power of economic magic is so great. This is also a necessary product of modern society.</p>
<p>We departed from Yishao Spring on the 30th, traveling with Mr. Xu. The road was still sandy, but flatter. After 30 li, we reached Gantangzi, with only two or three courtyards of empty houses remaining. There was no sign of life, only several barn owls standing still on the rooftops and a flock of gray pigeons in the courtyard. The pigeons flew away when people arrived. Mr. Xu suddenly saw a small yellow goat and was startled into a earth bed, where it was captured by smoke. It was a wild hare. There were dozens of buried vats in the house, which were said to be for storing water. Shortly after, Mr. Du and Mr. Luo arrived by car. They immediately took out dry steamed buns to eat, and each person drank a cup of tea, because the water source was 20 li away, and there was no way to fetch water.</p>
<p>We continued past Jianhou for 60 li to Yingpanshui. In the distance, we saw several broken houses and wondered if anyone lived there. There was a Guandi Temple east of the village, but the main hall was empty, and the pillars and rafters of the two corridors had also been dismantled. The ground was covered with tiles, so we suspected that no one lived there. Suddenly, we smelled the scent of opium coming faintly from the village house. Upon closer inspection, a woman with disheveled hair was smoking and enjoying herself. In the courtyard, a pile of horse manure had accumulated, and several piglets were fighting over a lamb fetus, with blood and flesh scattered everywhere. We went to another house, where the roof was riddled with holes and the tiles and rafters had been removed, leaving only four walls. We asked, and they said that the large army had taken them for fuel when passing through, and they had to sleep in the open. West of the village stood rows of tombstones, mostly with inscriptions such as "Military Cavalry Colonel" and "Chengde Lang" from the previous Qing dynasty, indicating that the villagers were still descendants of officials.</p>
<p>However, they have declined to this point because they do not engage in farming and are harmed by opium. Most of the villagers make a living by finding black moss, collecting half a catty to a catty per day, earning an average of 30 cents, but only for a few months of the year, which is not a long-term source of income. The method of collecting black moss is to use an iron rake to scrape it from the ground. It is most abundant in March, April, July, and August, and less abundant in May and June. If there is too much rain, it is difficult to rake up, and if there is too little rain, it will not grow. There were many buyers in previous years, and the price rose to 1.20 yuan per catty. Now, it is three catties per yuan, and it is impossible to sell. The lives of the villagers are becoming increasingly difficult. Black moss is used as a cold dish at the opening of businesses and banquets, because the sound of its name is the same as "get rich."</p>
<p>The lives of the villagers in that area are very difficult, so the customs have declined, and the women have become addicted to opium, so their behavior is often unruly. The place where we stayed was a relatively clean room. The furnishings were clear at a glance, including a dirt stove, a pile of fuel, a pair of sand vats, with several rolls of black moss placed in the middle, and no food for rats to eat. There was a broken dirt bed with two broken burlap bags and three small yellow sheepskins, which were the bedding for the residents. There was nothing else. The resident gave the bed to the guests and slept on the ground, which was very uncomfortable. On the 31st, we went out at dawn. The road was muddy, and the mountain torrents were raging. Only then did we know that it had rained heavily last night, but we had not heard the sound of rain because the earthen house had no tiles. The car could not travel, so we stayed where we had slept last night. We bought a beam of wood for 30 cents and broke it with stones to cook rice for lunch. In the afternoon, we chatted and said that such villages were like tribes from the primitive era, or even worse. Primitive people could dig holes and build forests to live in and hunt animals for food, but the villagers here could not get meat. The earthen houses could not withstand wind and rain and were not as comfortable as the cave dwellings and forest dwellings of primitive people. The host heard this and sighed, "I am from Dajin County. I originally had hundreds of acres of good land, and hundreds of households lived there, with a population of nearly a thousand people. Unfortunately, in 1918, there was a drought in the Northwest. I had no way to make a living, so I led my wife and children to flee here, eating wild vegetables every day, drinking cold water, and living in earthen caves. The living conditions at that time were a hundred times worse than they are now. Dajin has now returned to its original state. If I had the travel expenses, I would return home." We continued to inquire and learned that his wife was from a Confucian family and had three sisters. She was the second, named Ergu, who was intelligent and knew a few words, and was praised by the villagers. Unfortunately, her life was unfortunate. She had just married a farmer when she suffered a drought. Her eldest sister and third sister married officials and merchants, respectively, and were well-fed, but they were stingy and unwilling to help her. She also had a weak younger brother, who also fled due to the drought and was abandoned by her eldest sister and third sister. She alone comforted and retained him, and now he has grown up and can help with the work. When Ergu talked about her life, her demeanor was quite dignified. In the past, the stations near Yingpanshui were prosperous areas along the Gansu-Ningxia post road. There were merchants opening stores, people digging coal and salt mines, and people farming or picking mountain vegetables, all of whom could support themselves and make a living. Now, the population is sparse, and the houses are dilapidated. Places such as Gantangzi and Qingyajie have completely become ruins, with no sign of life, and the scenery is desolate, as if one is in the realm of ghosts. Alas, the cruelty of natural and man-made disasters!</p>
<h3>Hebei Province to Abolish Excessive Taxes in Stages. The First Phase Will Be Implemented in Mid-July. A Total of 1.24 Million Taxes Will Be Cut.</h3>
<p>Tianjin News: The Hebei Provincial Government previously passed the abolition of surcharges on land taxes and excessive miscellaneous taxes at its 524th meeting. Following the resolution of the Central Financial Conference, the Financial Department will implement the abolition in stages starting from July 1, the 23rd year of the Republic. The Financial Department will also select 47 counties from the province's 131 counties, based on the severity of the excessive taxes, and include them in the first phase. In these 47 counties, the land tax exceeds three times the amount of the original tax, and there are as many as 11 types of excessive taxes. It is estimated that the total amount of excessive taxes abolished in the first phase is 550,000 yuan. The land tax surcharges in 32 counties, including Cangxian, will be reduced by a total of 790,000 yuan. The total amount of taxes abolished in the two areas is 1.24 million yuan. The original date for implementation was July 1, but it was postponed to July 20 due to the unsettled compensatory measures and the inability of the counties to complete the preparations in time. However, the starting date is still July 1. The Financial Department is also planning the second phase, which will abolish a total of more than 1.1 million yuan in taxes. The third and fourth phases of the abolition will continue in turn. By the end of this year, the province will completely abolish the taxes according to the date determined by the National Financial Conference. There are two compensatory measures for the tax cuts: one is that 10% of the revenue from the tobacco and alcohol license tax collected by the province will be used, and the other is to carry out land reporting. The province's stamp tax collects a total of more than one million yuan per year. The province will take 10%, and the counties will take 30%. The province can use only 400,000 yuan for compensation. The license tax can collect 500,000 yuan per year, totaling less than 900,000 yuan, which is not enough to compensate for the amount of the first phase of the tax cuts. The compensation for the third and fourth phases is even more hopeless. Therefore, the Financial Department has decided to carry out land reporting at the same time to increase revenue. As for the tobacco and alcohol license tax, after the Ministry ordered that it be transferred to the province for collection on July 1, the Financial Department has submitted a request to the Provincial Government that the tax collection bureaus in the province and cities collect it on behalf of the province. Counties without tax collection bureaus will contract the tax collection to merchants, following the example of the tax on brokers. Separate methods for tax collection bureaus to collect on behalf of the province and counties to contract to merchants will be drafted separately and submitted to the Ministry for approval. However, the old Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau has reported to the Ministry that all the tobacco and alcohol licenses have been cancelled after the handover. Therefore, the Financial Department has sent a special telegram to the Ministry to issue another 100,000 licenses so that they can be collected within this month. The county governments have been ordered to determine the standard price according to the proportion of the tobacco and alcohol tax bureau's collection of license fees in their respective counties and to solicit bids from merchants within ten days so that the collection can begin immediately after the licenses are received.

<h3>Forty People Die of Heatstroke in Jinan. ▲Crops Wither and Drought Conditions Appear.</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondent: Since the beginning of summer, the weather in this city has been dry, with little rainfall, and drought conditions have gradually appeared. Since the rainfall on the 3rd, the heat has increased day by day. Yesterday (14th), the indoor temperature reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the outdoor temperature reached 125 degrees. There have been reports of people dying from heatstroke every day for the past three days. According to reports yesterday, as many as 40 people died. The number of people who were treated and recovered is difficult to count. Even a mule died of heatstroke. The asphalt roads in the city melted, and pedestrians walked as if they were walking on cotton. The autumn crops in the suburbs were also mostly damaged by drought. It is said that if there is no rain for another three days, the autumn harvest will be hopeless. It is estimated that the people who died of heatstroke included a woman south of Gan Shi Qiao, two people near Lude Hospital, one person in Anpingli, an old woman south of Tianqiao, three people in the Anhui Yidi, one man and one woman on Weiyi Road, a Feng student in Shunxing Yuan on Xiaowei Er Road, two water sellers named Guo and Zhou in Sanlizhuang, one person in Xishunju at the north end of Buzhengsi Street, one person in Sanyilou on Bianzhi Lane, one child in Beiyuan, two people on Anchasisi Street, one person on Xianqian Street, one person on Nanbeicang Lane, one person in Guanyuan, one person outside the South Gate, one person on Songlin Street, two people in Majialinzi, one person at the south entrance of Xinshichang, five people in front of Paotouquan, and eight people in the vicinity of Jindehui. A rickshaw puller suddenly fell to the ground and fainted at the south entrance of Weisan Road. Fortunately, a nearby hospital heard about it and immediately sent a doctor to see him. He still had a faint breath, so he was given a cardiotonic injection and was revived. There were also many reports of others whose lives were endangered by heatstroke. As for the exact number of deaths, I am afraid that it is more than that. (15th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Prohibits Articles on Men and Women Walking Together. ▲Regulations from the Provincial River Supervision and Distribution Bureau.</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent: The Guangdong provincial authorities have spared no effort in criticizing fashionable actions and modern etiquette. Previously, Zhang Zhiying, the commander of the fleet, proposed to ban men and women from swimming together in the summer, which has already been implemented by the Public Security Bureau. Recently, Zheng Ridong, the director of the Provincial River Supervision and Distribution Bureau, has proposed to the government to prohibit men and women from walking arm in arm. The following is a transcription of Zheng's original proposal: "Since world civilization has been poured into China, European and American customs have rushed in. Guangdong was the first to open up and is afraid of falling behind. Women are liberated, and social interactions are public. Giving peonies and picking orchids</p>
<p>spreads scandalous rumors beyond the Wei River, while returning beauty and leaving pipes transmit romantic stories in the corners of the city. During this transition period, there may be acts of wantonness and transgression in the pursuit of the two sexes. Bystanders criticize and consider it a cause for concern about people's hearts and morals. Ideologies go to extremes, and opinions are difficult to integrate. The recent order issued by the government to ban men and women from swimming together has aroused social attention. The nature of the people is stubborn and aspires to be saints and sages. They hate the new trend and strongly advocate ancient etiquette. I believe that the mixture of swimming pools should be banned first, but the prevention of parading in the city should not be delayed. In the past, men went by the right and women went by the left, as seen in the articles of the Wang Zhi Dao Lu. "There are women in cars, and there are women walking together," which are the poems of Zheng and Wei about lustful runaway. Nowadays, as social customs are declining and people's morals are becoming more perverse, they compete to imitate the fashion and disregard etiquette. Beautiful women with golden hair often tread on the streets, and delicate figures in embroidered pavilions are accustomed to soaring on the roads. Applying rouge and powder serves as a target, while exposing arms and breasts is deliberately provocative. As a result, swarms of bees chase after them, delighted to share the beauty, and stray butterflies follow behind, hoping to sniff a trace of fragrance. The frivolous often go up and down, while the sincere also gallop their hearts. In chance encounters, they may form illicit relationships, and in the bustle, each boasts of their glamorous encounters. The way of shame is completely lost, and cases of adultery and abduction are increasing day by day. What will the end be? Now that the practice of swimming together has already been banned, but there has been no prevention of the harm of walking together. I suspect that the clear prohibition is stricter on water than on land. In the end, I am afraid that the bad customs cannot be quelled, and the root cannot be corrected and the source cleared. Every time one sets foot on the road, one sees strange sights: strange costumes and seductive clothes, flocks of women in groups, holding hands and side by side, loving couples. Passersby look sideways, and vulgar people are even more heartbroken. Thinking that bad habits should be eliminated together, sighing who will share the tide, I humbly offer a contribution of straws and chen, serving as a Chen of the tube leopard. I hope that it will be adopted and implemented, and the future of the party-state will be very fortunate!" (July 10th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Disputes Between Songhui Garden and the Fire Brigade.</h3>
<p>The weather has been very dry recently, and there has been no rain for a long time. The river water has dried up, and the fire brigades in the first district are practicing their operations and testing their machinery in order to prevent fire alarms. They have notified all members to drive their vehicles to the Songhui Automobile Road every afternoon at 6:00 PM to test the vehicles. There is the Songhui Amusement Park there, which is a place for the people of Song to cool off and relax. The road is blocked by the general public who go to the automobile road to take a walk and cool off. At about 7:00 PM last night, the gasoline lamp inside the gate of the amusement park suddenly caught fire. The fire brigade members, seeing the situation, feared that a small spark would cause a prairie fire. Being responsible, they immediately drove the car to pour water. The onlookers applauded, and the sound of people was boiling over. The more people gathered, the more people gathered. Suddenly, the belt was cut off, and a barrel of Hua An Long Gaisi Lin was knocked over, and the transmission line was burned. The fire brigade suffered a lot of losses. It is unknown how someone threw bricks and smashed the doors and windows of the amusement park, and the chartered car was also damaged. As a result, a dispute arose between the fire brigade and the Songhui Amusement Park. The fire brigade filed a complaint with County Magistrate Jin at 11:00 PM that night. This morning, the county party department convened representatives from local organizations and the fire brigade to mediate. It is heard that the county government representative gently advised the fire brigade to suspend the vehicle test for two days and wait for a solution. The fire brigade has agreed to accept it. How will it be resolved in the future? We will continue to explore and report.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Villagers Come to the City to Report Famine and Petition</h3>
<p>Wu County has not had rain for over twenty days, and the drought is becoming apparent. Farmers from various villages are reporting the famine to the county government. More than 100 representatives, chosen by the farmers from 39 villages in Weiting, came to the city yesterday (the 16th) morning to petition the county government. Their purpose was twofold: (1) to request the opening of the Wangting Shadun harbor, (2) to request the allocation of twenty water-lifting machines. The Wu County Magistrate personally received them. Regarding the first point, according to the Construction Department's plan, water would be lifted into the Shadun harbor and introduced into the inland river. The Construction Department has commissioned Wang Yuanyuan to come to Suzhou immediately. Further discussions will be held upon his arrival in Suzhou. The second point must be submitted to the drought prevention conference on the 17th for comprehensive deliberation. The representatives left satisfied. It is also heard that the drought prevention committee has dispatched Committee Member Zhang Yunbo to Shanghai to purchase 43 water-lifting machines, which were transported to Suzhou yesterday (the 16th) in preparation for distribution to various villages for use.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Convenes to Discuss Relief for People's Food</h3>
<p>Chairman Shi of the County Chamber of Commerce, in view of the recent soaring rice prices and the difficult livelihood of the common people, specially convened rice industry representatives Xu Jusheng, Chen Junyu, Zhu Ren'an, Qian Lichun, and others at the Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 16th) to discuss relief measures. Chairman Shi Yunqing decided on four principles: (1) The grain industry association will notify all members to cease supplying outside areas in order to provide relief locally. (2) The rice shop association will list and report the actual sales volume in the last ten days, as well as the actual number of existing stocks, for verification. (3) The price of ordinary indica rice is even more related to the staple food of the poor and should be reduced by both associations. (4) The government should be petitioned to temporarily cancel the import tax on foreign rice to increase supply. The Chamber of Commerce will notify the representatives of the two associations of the above four measures, convene a meeting, and submit a report on the handling of the matter within three days.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Trafficking Drug Pills Arrested and Sent to the County</h3>
<p>Police officers from the Ninth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, earlier arrested Hu Litang in Rongxiang while carrying red pills. Three thousand red pills were confiscated and handed over to the main bureau for strict interrogation. According to his confession, the red pills belonged to Dong Bifu, a former guard in the Public Security Bureau, who instructed him to deliver them to a certain place. The Inspectorate dispatched Inspector Ge to arrest Dong Bifu and bring him to the bureau. Dong confessed to trafficking drug pills without hesitation. Yesterday (the 16th), both were sent to the county government for trial. In addition, the counties of Xiyi Lichang have long been places permeated with poisonous atmosphere. In addition to opium and morphine, Wuxi also has red, black, white, fast, and super-fast drug pills, which sell extremely well. It is heard that the manufacturers are Hu, Xiao, Xu, and others, who are making considerable profits.</p>
<h3>Farmer Commits Suicide Due to Drought</h3>
<p>Zhou Gengquan, a villager from Houwu Lane in the Fourth District, was 38 years old and worked as a farmer. Recently, he was plagued by poverty and illness, and seeing the crops withered and the autumn harvest hopeless, his livelihood became difficult to maintain. He secretly hanged himself a few days ago. It is indeed tragic.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Epidemic Rampant, Deaths Follow</h3>
<p>Yangzhou is experiencing extreme heat and severe drought. An epidemic of acute infectious disease is prevalent. According to reports, eighteen people died from the epidemic in Huoqiao within two hours. According to the report of the temple caretaker of the Prefectural Temple, the number of deaths in recent days (according to Yangzhou custom, when people die, they must go to the Prefectural Temple to offer incense, called "paving the hall") has been over a hundred, with the highest reaching 217 people.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Elderly Female Farmers Go to the County to Protest Famine</h3>
<p>Extreme heat and drought have created a famine. Farmers prayed to gods and Buddhas, but to no avail. The autumn harvest is about to be hopeless. On the morning of the 14th, fifty to sixty female farmers from Chuiyi Tu in Anqiao Township went to the county government to protest the famine, stating that there was no way to lift water, the rice fields had turned into scorched earth, rice prices were soaring, and life was difficult. They requested an on-site inspection and relief. The crowd was large and chaotic. Zhang Hailong, a staff member of the county government, represented Magistrate Xu and came out to comfort them, promising to find a way to provide relief and giving each person 60 cash for refreshments before they dispersed.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Key Suspects in the East Gate Bloodshed Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Li Shijie and Xu Mingde, the key suspects in the violent assault and bloodshed case at the Risheng Lou on East Gate Street in this county, fled far away by boat with two rifles and one short gun after the incident. Li's wife, Li's sister Shunbao, and village police officer Ji A'quan were unable to escape and were arrested by police officers dispatched by the County Public Security Bureau and sent to the court. Chief Prosecutor Zhang Bing severely interrogated Li's wife and learned that the criminals had fled to Pinghu. Li's wife and the village police officer were ordered to be detained. Li's sister Shunbao was temporarily released on bail. After receiving the news, Sun Minze, the head of the Baochong Tuan, telegraphed the Pinghu Security Corps to order them to investigate the whereabouts of the criminals and detain them at any time. In the afternoon, the two criminals were found in Donghu carrying guns and the symbol of the county's security corps. They were immediately detained and temporarily held in the headquarters, awaiting the court's arrival for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Villagers Report Famine in Succession</h3>
<p>There is a severe drought here. Forty percent of the fields in the county have not been planted, and those that have been transplanted are also withered. According to general estimates, the future autumn harvest will be no more than 30 to 40 percent. The county government is now doing its best to save the situation. As for drinking water, the rivers in the urban area are mostly dry. Many Buddhist grandmothers are prostrating themselves on the riverbed to pray. 107 of the public wells in the urban and rural areas have dried up. The district office is investigating and trying to dig deeper to temporarily provide drinking water. However, the weather has been hot for days, and there is still no sign of rain, making people even more apprehensive. Farmers from various villages have reported the famine and petitioned the county government, party headquarters, farmers' association, and other places. However, the authorities can only try to comfort them and urge them to return to their villages to cultivate. On the morning of the 15th, County Magistrate and District Chief Shen Changjun, along with Assistant Zhou Zimei and others, went to various villages in Da Yi Bridge to inspect the disaster situation.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Drawing River Water to Relieve Drought</h3>
<p>Tong County has suffered from a long drought, resulting in disaster. People from all walks of life in the area have been meeting for days to discuss relief measures and have decided to build a dam at Ren Harbor and use an electric engine to draw river water for internal irrigation.

<h3>Wang Jingwei Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Returned to Beijing in the Evening to Seek Medical Treatment for Chronic Illness and Issue a Written Statement</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 7:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Railways, to seek medical treatment from German doctor Noll for his chronic illness. He returned to Beijing on the night train at 11:00 PM. At 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Wang issued a written statement regarding the resolutions of the Central Political Conference last Wednesday on the impeachment case by the Control Yuan and the issue of Hu Hanmin going abroad, making some statements. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, has suffered from diabetes for several years. He occasionally takes time off from Beijing to come to Shanghai for medical treatment. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the night train at 7:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Railways. He got off the train at Nanxiang Station, took his own car and went directly to his private residence on West Pubishi Road to rest. At around 8:00 AM, he telegraphed Dr. Noll to go and examine his old illness. He left after about an hour. According to those around him, Wang came here to treat his old diabetes, with no other tasks, and plans to return to Beijing on the night train.</p>
<h3>Proposal by Standing Committee Members of the Central Political Conference</h3>
<p>Wang issued a written statement yesterday afternoon, the original text of which is as follows: (Reporter asked) There are three resolutions of the Central Political Conference last Wednesday regarding the impeachment case by the Control Yuan. What are the reasons? (Wang replied) This is a proposal by five members of the Central Standing Committee, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Guofu, and Wang Zhaoming, which was passed by the conference. Originally, the so-called separation of powers is not individual separation, without any connection. This principle is understood by scholars who have studied constitutional law. The Outline of National Reconstruction stipulates that the presidents of the five Yuan are appointed and supervised by the President during the initial period of constitutional government, which shows that although the five powers are separated, they still have a system. The current Organic Law of the National Government stipulates that the Chairman of the National Government does not bear actual political responsibility, and Article 15 stipulates that before the promulgation of the Constitution, the presidents of the five Yuan are each responsible to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, which shows that although the five powers are separated, they still have a system. The so-called Central Executive Committee, in addition to the plenary meeting held once every six months, usually has the Central Executive Committee Standing Committee to handle party affairs and the Central Executive Committee Political Conference to handle political affairs, both of which are held once a week. Currently, except for Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, Sun Zhesheng, the President of the Legislative Yuan, Ju Juesheng, the President of the Judicial Yuan, Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, and I, are all standing committee members of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Conference. Regarding the affairs of the five Yuan, they are responsible to the Central Executive Committee on the one hand, and seek communication and liaison within the Central Executive Committee on the other hand. Therefore, all major affairs of the five Yuan must be submitted to the Central Political Conference for approval. We only need to look at what is discussed and approved by each Central Political Conference, most of which are proposals from the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, to understand. Therefore, this time the Central Political Conference provides guidance and supervision on the affairs of the Control Yuan, just as it provides guidance and supervision on the administrative affairs of the Legislative Yuan. Some people outside believe that this resolution hinders the independence of the power of supervision, which is absolutely wrong.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Impeachment Case by Control Yuan</h3>
<p>The establishment of an impeachment case by the Control Yuan begins with a proposal by one member and ends with a review by three members. From this, it can be seen that the so-called establishment of an impeachment case is only the intention of the impeachment party, and the intention of the impeached party has not yet been expressed, and the intention of the disciplinary agency has not been expressed. Most people believe that the establishment of an impeachment case means that the guilt of the impeached party is established, which is an absolute misunderstanding. After the establishment of the impeachment case, the president of the Control Yuan transfers it to the disciplinary agency. If it is a general civil servant, the disciplinary agency is the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee organized by the Judicial Yuan. If it is a political official, the disciplinary agency is the Political Official Disciplinary Committee organized by the National Government. This is the current system. According to this system, after receiving the impeachment case from the Control Yuan, the disciplinary agency notifies the impeached person within a certain period to allow them to defend themselves. After receiving the impeached person's statement, it convenes a meeting to review it, two or three times. After the review, it either judges that it should be subject to disciplinary action, or judges that it should not be subject to disciplinary action. To give an analogy, the Control Yuan is like an ordinary criminal prosecutor, and the Disciplinary Committee is like a judge. If the establishment of an impeachment case is considered the establishment of the guilt of the impeached party, it is like taking the words of the prosecutor as the crime of the impeached party, without the need for further trial, which is equally confused.</p>
<h3>Inappropriate to Announce Before Disciplinary Action</h3>
<p>The above is a brief explanation of the current system. The following is the origin of the resolution of the Central Political Conference. Originally, according to the Control Yuan's impeachment law, the content of all impeachment cases must not be announced before they are transferred to the disciplinary agency. As a result, many members of the Control Yuan announced the content arbitrarily to the outside world after transferring it to the disciplinary agency, and even published the full text of the impeachment case in the newspaper. It should be known that this impeachment case has only been transferred to the disciplinary agency and has not yet been notified by the disciplinary agency to the impeached person to allow them to defend themselves, let alone the review by the disciplinary agency. If the full text of the impeachment case is published at this time, isn't it only the opinion of the impeachment party, and not the opinion of the impeached party and the disciplinary agency? Is this fair? It should be known that national legislation emphasizes both rewarding good and punishing evil. For example, punishing corruption should be given equal weight to protecting integrity, and punishing those who neglect their duties and violate the law should be given equal weight to protecting those who are diligent and law-abiding. Public opinion should also be like this. Whenever an impeachment case is seen, it should not be used as a means of celebrating the punishment of the guilty. At the same time, special attention should be paid to protecting the innocent. Otherwise, how can the country and society encourage people to do good? For example, a small civil servant is impeached by a member of the Control Yuan, and after review by three members, he is accused of corruption. At the time of transferring it to the disciplinary agency, he also divulges it to the outside world. Then, everyone who reads the newspaper will recognize him as corrupt. If this civil servant receives this charge of corruption and the situation is true and the crime is confirmed, it is still acceptable. But what if he is wrongly accused? Before receiving the notice from the disciplinary agency, there is no way to defend himself. What an injustice! Even if he receives the notice from the disciplinary agency and submits a statement of defense, what ability does this small civil servant have to make this statement of defense be publicized in the newspaper in the same way as the impeachment case? Then, this civil servant's guilt was originally established after the judgment of the disciplinary agency, but now, when the impeachment case is announced, his guilt has already become known to the public in the newspaper. What an unfairness! The above is the case of a civil servant who is wrongly accused. As for political officials, it is even different. Originally, political officials bear political responsibility. Therefore, the disciplinary law does not have any punishments for political officials such as demerit, salary reduction, demotion, etc., only a reprimand for minor offenses and dismissal for serious offenses. Reprimand need not be discussed. If a political official's policy does not work, he should retire, without the need for any disciplinary action. The impact of the Control Yuan's impeachment of a political official is not only on the political official himself, but on the policy being implemented. This policy sometimes needs to be kept secret and cannot be discussed publicly. It should be known that this is not to keep it secret for the political official's own good or bad, but for the political official to keep it secret for the benefit of the country. Therefore, it is impossible for this political official, who bears political responsibility, to confront the Control Yuan's impeachment case and publish it in the newspaper. It goes without saying for national defense and foreign affairs, but other ministries and commissions sometimes need to keep secrets in the interest of national policy. In this case, it is most unfair to only allow the Control Yuan to announce the impeachment case and not allow the impeached person to announce the statement of defense. It seems fairer to announce both, but civil servants suffer from the inability to announce, and political officials suffer from the inability to announce.</p>
<h3>Hu to Go Abroad to Promote Policies</h3>
<p>(Asked) There are rumors that Mr. Hu Zhantang intends to go abroad. I wonder if this is true. (Answered) Mr. Hu Zhantang has indeed asked someone to indicate that he wants to go to Europe and the United States to promote policies for the central government. The colleagues of the central government have gladly agreed to this. However, because Mr. Hu has been far away in Hong Kong for several years, there must be many things about the central government's policies that he does not fully understand. We hope that Mr. Hu can come to Nanjing before traveling, or at least come to Shanghai, so that we can discuss in detail. We are now seeking Mr. Hu's consent to this proposal, but have not yet received a reply. As for whether Mr. Sun Zhesheng or Mr. Kong Yongzhi will go to Hong Kong in the future, it has not yet been decided, because Mr. Sun is on vacation in Honolulu, and Mr. Kong has just returned from North China, and there are many things to deal with, so they may not be able to leave for a while.</p>
<h3>China-British Construction Bank Group Agrees to Lend Huge Sum to Ministry of Railways 16 Million Yuan Shared Equally Loan to Complete Gate-Cao Section and Repay Internal and External Debts</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, in order to complete the road line and bridges between Xixing and Cao'e on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and to repay the internal and external debts of the road, borrowed 16 million yuan from a bank group jointly formed by the China-British Bank and the China Construction Bank, and was approved to issue bonds by the bank group. Now, according to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, the details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Proceeding with the Loan</h3>
<p>The track between Xixing and Cao'e on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has not been built due to the Qiantang River Railway Bridge problem. The total length of the road line is 78 kilometers. As for the Cao'e River Bridge, except for the bridge foundation which has been filled, the rest was suspended due to the European War. Now the Qiantang River Railway Bridge will begin construction. The Ministry of Railways, in order to complete the section and the Cao'e River Bridge, as well as to repay the internal and external debts of the road, is proceeding to borrow money from the banking sector.</p>
<h3>Principles Determined</h3>
<p>In light of the fact that both the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been repaying their debts and interest on schedule, resulting in a daily increase in the price of bonds abroad, the British and Chinese Corporation is extremely willing to lend money to the two railways to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line. At the same time, the newly opened China Development Finance Corporation is also willing to invest in the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line. The Ministry of Railways dispatched personnel to join the two railway administrations to discuss loan methods with the British and Chinese Corporation and the China Development Finance Corporation. The principles have been determined.</p>
<h3>Joint Syndicate</h3>
<p>The total loan amount from the Ministry of Railways to the British and Chinese Corporation and the China Development Finance Corporation is 16 million yuan, which will be borrowed by a syndicate jointly organized by the British and Chinese Corporation and the China Development Finance Corporation, with 8 million yuan from the British and Chinese Corporation and 8 million yuan from the China Development Finance Corporation. The syndicate is also allowed to issue bonds that can be circulated in domestic and foreign markets. All loan terms are still under negotiation, but the interest rate is reportedly 6%.</p>
<h3>Joint Bridge and Road Construction</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and other agencies believe that the construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge and the completion of the Xixing to Cao'e section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway are closely related. Now that the funds for the construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge have been raised, and the lending principles for the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line have also been determined, it is rumored that a joint construction will be decided in the future, so that the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line will be connected in one go.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Industrial Federation to First Meet Kong in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Present the Advantages and Disadvantages of Not Modifying the New Tariff</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Chinese General Chamber of Industry, in response to members' requests, convened an emergency meeting on the 7th of this month at its meeting hall on Hankou Road to discuss the new import tariff announced by the Ministry of Finance. It was resolved to send representatives, including Guo Shun and six others, to petition in Beijing on a scheduled basis. The representatives were originally scheduled to depart last night, but since Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has not yet returned to Beijing since his return to Shanghai, the representatives intend to first present the advantages and disadvantages of not modifying the new tariff to Minister Kong in Shanghai, request his consideration, and then proceed to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Industry, and other relevant Yuan and Ministries, hoping for remedial measures.</p>
<h3>After Revision of the American Cotton Loan Contract, the First Batch Arrives in Shanghai Today, Totaling More Than 20,800 Pieces, Discharged at China Merchants Bureau's Chinese Warehouse</h3>
<p>The cotton purchased by our country from the United States with loan funds will, after the contract is revised, immediately have a large batch of 10 million US dollars' worth of cotton shipped from North America to China starting in June. The first shipment was chartered by the American firm Fook Lai &amp; Co. using the giant ship Fernlane, which was loaded with cotton at the New York United Port in North America, totaling 20,809 bales, occupying more than 10,000 tons. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 15th, but due to encountering wind and fog en route, the voyage was slightly delayed, and the arrival date was two days later than originally planned. It arrived yesterday noon. A wireless message was received from the ship stating that it would be allowed to enter Wusong at noon today. Fook Lai &amp; Co. has already hired a pilot and prepared to guide it to Shanghai, and notified the China Merchants Bureau to prepare for storage. The Bureau originally planned to store the goods in the Yangtze Wharf warehouse, but because the entire batch of cotton would be shipped one after another, totaling more than 200,000 pieces, the Yangtze Wharf alone would not be able to accommodate it, and the repair work had not yet been completed, so the first shipment arriving today was changed to be stored in the Chinese warehouse in Pudong. Yesterday, the wharf management office notified the warehouse to prepare all loading and unloading procedures. As for the cotton carried by the remaining ships, they will also be shipped to Shanghai in this short period of time. In the future, there will be 40,000 to 50,000 pieces arriving in Shanghai every month. It is also heard that three wheat ships that were blocked in the United States due to the strike have now departed from the United States and are expected to arrive in Shanghai within this week.</p>
<h3>Site of the Central Machinery Factory Requested to Be Located in the City Center, The Seventh District Party Department Specially Submits to the City Party Department to Request the Ministry of Industry Not to Establish It in the Concession</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Industry plans to establish a central machinery factory in Shanghai and has already surveyed the area around North Suzhou Road as the factory site, as reported in the previous newspaper. The Party Department of the Seventh District of this city believes that the Ministry of Industry should select the central area of this city as the factory site for the establishment of the central machinery factory. Yesterday, it specially submitted to the City Party Department to request the Ministry of Industry to re-determine the factory site. The original text stated that the Ministry of Industry originally planned to establish the central machinery factory in the capital, but now that Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, the area around North Suzhou Road in Shanghai has been changed, etc. It is found that the central area of Shanghai is currently actively developing and the results are considerable. In the future, the center of industry and commerce will naturally be the central area of the city. Now that the Ministry of Industry has established the central machinery factory, and the factory site is sheltered in the concession, it seems to contradict the Prime Minister's plan to open up a greater Shanghai port. For this reason, it is proposed to submit a document to your department to request the Ministry of Industry to determine the factory site of the central machinery factory in the central area of the city, in order to seek the prosperity of a greater Shanghai, which is truly a public convenience.</p>
<h3>Fire Brigades in Various Districts Carry Out Drought Prevention Work, Dispatched Ten Pump Trucks, Set Off to Rural Areas to Pump Water, Conducted in Nine Districts</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the City Government of this city, considering that the rural areas in the city are facing a drought due to the long-term drought, has convened the 264th meeting of the government and decided to allocate 60,000 yuan to purchase a large number of water pumps and distribute them to various rural areas for application, which will be entirely handled by the Social, Land, and Public Security Bureaus, etc. However, since the water pumps could not be rushed for a while, Wen Hongen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, instructed Dong Zhihe, the director of the fire protection section of the second section of the bureau, to order ten fire pump trucks from the fire brigades in various districts of this city to go to various rural areas to pump water, which was conducted in nine districts: (1) "Longhua District" was the responsibility of the Shanghai North and South District fire brigades; (2) "Pengpu District" was handled by the third section of the Zhabei fire brigade; (3) "Zhabei District" was the responsibility of the fourth section of the Zhabei fire brigade; (4) "Caojing District" was handled by the Shanghai South and West District fire brigades; (5) "Pusong District" was jointly conducted by the Caoxi Road in Western Shanghai and the Dongjiadu fire brigades in Southern Shanghai; (6) "Yinxiang District" was the responsibility of the first section of the Zhabei fire brigade; (7) "Yinhang District" was the responsibility of the second section of the Zhabei fire brigade; (8) "Jiangwan District" was handled by the Jiangwan fire brigade; (9) "Zhenru District" was the responsibility of the Zhenru Town fire brigade. At 9:00 am yesterday, Director Dong of the bureau went to Yishiyuan on Ninghe Road to contact the drought relief committee and worked with representatives from various rural areas to handle the matter. Therefore, the fire brigades in various districts have set off to conduct the work since 10:00 am yesterday.</p>
<p>In the Zhabei District, the Fire Brigade Union convened various fire brigades the day before yesterday to discuss relief distribution methods. It was designated that in addition to the third section responsible for the Pengpu District and the fourth section responsible for the Yinxiang District, which have already been mobilized, the first and second sections in the territory, due to the relatively frequent fires, will take care of the Zhabei District in the vicinity for the sake of local consideration. It is heard that since yesterday (the 16th), the respective sections have dispatched vehicles to work with the farmers' association to start pumping water at the Baziqiao on Liuyin Road in Zhabei to facilitate irrigation and provide temporary relief.</p>
<h3>Rice Price Increases Due to Drought Hindering Transportation, City Government Orders Cease, Abundant Stock in the Interior, Foreign Merchants Purchasing Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the city government, in addition to allocating funds for drought relief, considers the soaring rice prices in the market to have a significant impact on the people's food and has ordered the city's Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the matter. It has been found that the rice price in this city has soared due to the long-term drought, and has increased by more than three yuan per stone in less than half a month. If it continues to increase, it will inevitably affect the people's food. The government previously approved the Zhejiang Provincial Government's telegram requesting restrictions on rice prices, and ordered the bureau to comply. It is hereby ordered again that the bureau immediately comply and promptly and properly stop any opportunistic profiteering to maintain the people's food and calm the people's hearts, and report the handling situation. This order is issued. It is now known that the City Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to inform the rice merchants to restrict rice prices to maintain the people's food.</p>
<p>According to Jiang Shizhi, the chairman of the Rice Grain Guild, the rice and grain in Shanghai are supplied by Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Jiashan, Qingpu, Jiangyin, Changzhou, Yixing, Liyang, and other places. Because all places have had good harvests in the past three years, the grain stock in the interior is more than in previous years. According to the statistics obtained at the end of the abolished lunar calendar's Dragon Boat Festival, the total number of grains stored in the above-mentioned places is more than 600,000 stones of japonica rice, more than 300,000 stones of indica rice, and more than 200,000 stones of glutinous rice, totaling 1.2 million stones. As of now, the total stock is still more than 700,000 stones. According to estimates, this number is sufficient to maintain the market until the new rice is available.</p>
<h3>Reduced Arrivals</h3>
<p>Normally, the total number of rice ships arriving in Shanghai from various places every day in the north and south markets reaches 70 (each boat can hold 100 to 200 stones of rice, averaging about 12,000 stones). Compared to the long-term drought without rain, the fields are cracked, and the river water in Jiangyin, Changzhou, Yixing, Liyang, and other places is blocked, causing rice ships to disappear. The number of rice ships in Suzhou and Changzhou has also sharply decreased. On average, only 30 ships arrive in the north and south markets every day. However, the rice stock in Shanghai can still be maintained for one or two weeks.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Price Increase</h3>
<p>Jiang also stated that the reasons for the gradual increase in rice prices are: (1) The small rivers in the interior have no water, and the grains from the surrounding countryside cannot be transported to the town; (2) Those who have stored rice and want to sell it are prevented by the villagers in order to prevent drought; (3) Rice merchants in this port have been going to the interior to buy large quantities of grain, and tens of thousands of stones have already been transacted; (4) People's hearts are not calm, so many are hoarding rice to wait for the famine; (5) Rice merchants are hoarding and not selling; (6) Speculators are raising prices to buy; (7) Due to the drought without rain, the farmers are mostly focused on irrigating the fields and building dams to store water, and rice ships are blocked. Due to these complex reasons, an unprecedented panic has been created.</p>
<h3>Huge Profits</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reporter also investigated the rice transport merchants, saying that the rice stock in the interior is indeed still abundant, but most of the boat households are currently planting rice and irrigating, resulting in fewer rice ships arriving. Normally, moving rice from the interior to Shanghai can earn a profit of two to three corners to five corners per stone after expenses, which is already a great business. Now, due to the unrest in people's hearts and the manipulation of some people, each stone of rice can earn a profit of three to four yuan. The price of grain, which is more than four yuan per dan, is sold for thirteen yuan after shelling at a 50% discount, plus food expenses, wages, and interest. Therefore, the general rice transport merchants are all making three times the profit in the market and are overjoyed.</p>
<h3>Future of People's Food</h3>
<p>According to another source, the rice industry is considering ordering 500,000 stones of foreign rice to prevent famine. However, looking back at the flood of 1931, the ordering of foreign rice caused a sharp decline in domestic rice. If this is done again this time, domestic products will also suffer a great impact in the future. This year, the grain in Jiangbei has had a bumper harvest, as has Hunan. The situation in Jiangxi is equal in terms of good and bad harvests. Therefore, domestic rice and grain are sufficient to maintain the people's food in various places, and there is no need to panic. Ordering foreign rice is superfluous.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants' Request</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times News Agency, foreign merchants engaged in importing and exporting grains in this port, such as Daofu, Anli, Xiangmao, Gongping, Taifeng, and Xinfeng, are concerned about the increasing drought and rising rice prices in our country, which show a shortage of domestic grain. They can ship and sell imported grain, but due to tariff restrictions, they must pay 1.65 gold units per 100 kilograms, which is still too burdensome and difficult to promote sales. They specially sent representatives to Beijing to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reduce the tax by half. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported the situation to the Executive Yuan and consulted with the Ministries of Finance and Industry. The result was that the matter was related to national policy and should not be changed easily. If it is necessary to import duty-free, it should also be planned by the Executive Yuan as a whole. Within a certain quantity range, special permission should be granted for import, and foreign merchants should not use this to make profits. Therefore, the foreign merchants' request did not have any results.</p>
<h3>Ordered One Thousand Tons</h3>
<p>Although the foreign merchants' request did not achieve its purpose this time, they believe that the recent soaring rice prices, compared with foreign countries, are still profitable even after paying tariffs. Currently, Daofu Foreign Company has telegraphed to Saigon to order 1,000 tons to China, which will be fully sold by the major rice shops on Dou Market Street, with a transaction price of 10.1 yuan per dan. It can arrive in Shanghai soon. The bean and rice industry will also import 500,000 dan of duty-free foreign rice. The rice price in this port is expected to stabilize with the backing of foreign rice, and will not skyrocket again.</p>

<h3>Cai Zengji Talks About Issuing City Public Bonds, Discussing Construction is Truly a Matter of Utmost Urgency, The Principal and Interest Repayment Fund is the Most Secure</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the 3.5 million yuan of municipal bonds issued by this city in 1934 has been approved by the central government and is scheduled to be issued today. Cai Zengji, the director of the city's Finance Bureau, made the following remarks on the issuance of public bonds yesterday: "This city has to issue public bonds in order to cope with municipal facilities. Shanghai is a major port in East Asia, the center of the world market, and the hub of the nation's culture. At a time when the world is intent on construction and making rapid progress, today's Shanghai cannot be compared with Shanghai sixty years ago when it was stuck in its ways. Therefore, the responsibilities of today's Shanghai Municipal Government are extremely heavy, and all those who care about the world situation are well aware of this. According to the modern cities that concentrate culture, to solve all kinds of complex problems, it must first have considerable basic facilities. This city is an important city, so it cannot be an exception. However, looking back at this city since the revolution, most of the facilities have been lacking. The sports field, museum, library, hospital, slaughterhouse, etc., which are currently being discussed for construction, are only a part of the above-mentioned basic facilities, and are truly a matter of utmost urgency. These facilities are being gradually implemented in the special zones of this city. This city's makeshift measures are not worthy of the citizens who pay taxes, and the inferiority is also crucial to the national system. Moreover, those who plot against us often use the fact that the Chinese people lack organization and management capabilities as propaganda. If we do not strive for progress in the small matter of municipal facilities, we will not be able to correct the world's view. However, since the discussion of the above-mentioned items is so urgent, and the annual regular income of this city has designated uses, it is necessary to issue public bonds to cope with it. As for the reason for issuing public bonds, the use of foreign capital is actually beneficial and harmless. According to recent surveys, more than half of the surplus silver in Shanghai belongs to foreign merchants, mostly due to the annual international trade surplus stored in Shanghai. Under the current environment, this foreign capital is unlikely to flow into the interior. If foreign merchants do not invest in Shanghai to make profits, they will inevitably remit a large amount of cash to their home countries. For the government's sake, to stabilize domestic finance, it should try to make use of it and not allow it to overflow. Therefore, the late Prime Minister advocated the use of foreign capital, which is a clear instruction, and he has seen this. This city's issuance of public bonds will be underwritten by a Sino-foreign syndicate organized by Xinfeng Foreign Company. In the future, foreign merchants will account for the majority of those who invest in these public bonds. This city can use foreign capital to develop municipal administration, which will also be of considerable benefit to domestic finance. As for the lower interest rate of foreign capital, that is another matter. This time, the issuance of public bonds will use the car donations for cars, motorcycles, and bicycles in this city as a fund for repaying the principal and interest, which is also the most secure. The roads in this city have been expanding in recent years, and the number of vehicles has also been increasing. The annual income from the above-mentioned three car donations has reached more than 600,000 yuan. Allocating the above to the public bond's principal and interest repayment fund is truly more than sufficient. In recent years, the highways of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Ningbo, and Shanghai have been completed, and cars can be interconnected. In the future, vehicles that donate for city licenses can reach the highways and roads of the five provinces and cities, including about 718 kilometers in Jiangsu Province, about 912 kilometers in Zhejiang Province, about 120 kilometers in Anhui Province, and about 350 kilometers in this city. All vehicles can maximize their functional use and will become more developed in the future. It can be asserted that compared to vehicles that only donate for special zone licenses and can only travel within the special zone (the roads in the two special zones total about 360 kilometers), the effect cannot be compared. In the future, vehicles in the special zones will be aware of the disparity in usage opportunities and will try to obtain city licenses as much as possible. The car donation income in this city will be even more considerable. As for the market price of this public bond, it will be registered in the Shanghai Public Industry Association after issuance and can be circulated to the foreign financial market. Its price will gradually increase. For example, the disaster area reconstruction public bonds issued last time are now more than 3% above the face value, which can be proved."</p>

<h3>Chen Guangfu Has Returned to Shanghai, The Plan for Reorganizing the Shenxin Factories Has Been Drafted</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Shenxin, Fuxin, and Maoxin textile and flour mills operated by Chinese industrialist Rong Zongjing are now being reorganized by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, and Cotton Control Association due to business relations. Chen Guangfu, who went to Beijing to report, has returned to Shanghai, and the reorganization plan has been drafted. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reorganization Plan. The Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, Cotton Control Association, etc., have consulted with Wang Yuqing, the newly appointed general manager of Shenxin, Fuxin, Maoxin and other factories, on the reorganization methods for the first reorganization of the Xin Shen Textile factories, while trying to prevent the suspension of work. The reorganization plan has now been drafted, and the assets of the Shenxin factories have also been estimated. The Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Finance, etc., have submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, and after approval, a reorganization committee will be formed to reorganize the factories.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Returned to Shanghai. Chen Guangfu, the Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council's Cotton Control Association, who recently went to Beijing to report to the Executive Yuan on the case of reorganizing the Shenxin textile factories under his command, and re-contacted the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, has completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he went to the Shanghai Bank to work as usual.</p>
<p>China and Shanghai Banks Lending Money. The debts of Shenxin, Fuxin, Maoxin and other factories are the largest to Shanghai Bank and China Bank. As of 1933, China Industrial Lending was 42,455,468 yuan, and Shanghai Industrial Lending was 34,576,708 yuan. Lending to yarn factories accounted for 60% of the total, and lending to flour mills accounted for 14% of the total. The above-mentioned lending to textile factories and flour mills is mainly to Shenxin, Fuxin, and Maoxin. However, the New Voice News Agency reporter inquired with the two banks yesterday and learned that these lendings all have reliable collateral and are not credit lending. As for the case of further lending to maintain the Shenxin factories, it is still in progress.</p>

<h3>海關稅務司　解釋復出口貨辦法　貨物與報單相符自可免稅放行</h3>
<p>The Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs responded yesterday to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that he had received a letter from the Ironware, Hardware, and four other industry associations, concerning the difficulty of maintaining the original form of iron goods when they are re-exported, and requesting consideration.

When re-exported, if the permit or duplicate permit is presented, detailing the imported goods and the declared goods, and the Customs inspection confirms their conformity, they may be released duty-free. The practice of cutting iron into small pieces locally remains unchanged. However, if cutting is desired locally, it must be stated on the import declaration.

<p>Regarding Japanese vessels crossing the border to fish illegally, Director Yuan stated that repeated reports had been received of numerous Japanese vessels frequently appearing outside Wusong Port, illegally catching fish in China's territorial waters.

The office is currently consulting with the Coast Guard to devise effective measures for strict enforcement.</p>
<p>Regarding the investigation of the fishermen's situation, he continued that the fishing season has passed, and the autumn season is expected around the end of August or the beginning of September, still over a month away. During this period, the four fisheries protection vessels have no practical work to do, so they are undergoing routine repairs, which will be completed soon. After the repairs are finished, they plan to patrol the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to investigate the fishermen's living conditions, the quantity of fish production, and the activities of pirates.</p>

Therefore, we jointly write to request that your federation send a letter to the police authorities to effectively stop and strictly prohibit this behavior.

<h3>Taxpayer's Reply to the City Federation Branch: Chinese Merchant Insurance is Reliable; Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Seeks to Evade Compensation to the Yi Feng Factory; All Industries Should Know How to Choose Insurance in the Future</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Concession received a letter from the 11th District Branch of the City Federation, requesting assistance in negotiating the delayed payment of fire insurance compensation by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. The Association stated that the matter concerned commerce and instructed the City Chamber of Commerce to request action, and advised that future insurance be taken out with Chinese merchant insurance companies. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>City Federation Letter: To Whom It May Concern, we have received a letter from our member, Yi Feng Hosiery Factory, stating that our factory unfortunately suffered two accidental fires on May 20th and 21st of last year, which were both extinguished by our own efforts. Prior to the fires, we had insured with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. for fire insurance amounting to 26,800.08 foreign dollars, with Wing Fung Insurance for 15,000 foreign dollars, and with Si Ming Insurance for 11,000 foreign dollars. After the incidents, the three companies designated San Yi Public Assessment Firm as loss investigators. They issued a detailed loss statement, calculating the destruction at 2,351.20 foreign dollars, and the permanent loss at 907.20 foreign dollars. After reporting to San Yi Public Assessment Firm, the firm assessed the loss at 1,930 foreign dollars, which was a significant discrepancy from our factory's actual losses. Although we contested this vigorously without success, we had no choice but to reluctantly accept it. San Yi Firm then prepared a formal report and sent it to the insurance companies. Wing Fung was to pay 442.29 foreign dollars and Si Ming was to pay 402.09 foreign dollars, which we received in full on the 19th and 20th of this month. However, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s portion of 1,085.62 foreign dollars has not been formally acknowledged to date. After our factory sent a letter of inquiry, the company made excuses and procrastinated, claiming that it was still under investigation. To date, no progress has been made. Considering their intentions, it is clear that they are deliberately delaying payment, intending to evade their responsibility. If this precedent is set, our Chinese merchant policyholders will lose their protection in the future. Therefore, we are writing to request that your esteemed Association forward this letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting that they write to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to negotiate. We hereby express our sincere gratitude for your assistance.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Letter: In response to your letter regarding Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s failure to pay insurance compensation, requesting our assistance in negotiating, we have determined that this case falls within the scope of commercial matters. Yi Feng Hosiery Factory should be advised to request the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce to negotiate. Furthermore, Si Ming Insurance has already paid the full amount for the fire insurance taken out by Yi Feng Hosiery Factory, while Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. is making excuses and procrastinating. This clearly demonstrates that the credibility of Chinese merchant insurance companies is indeed superior to that of foreign merchants. Rather than lamenting after the fact, it is better to carefully choose beforehand. It is our Association's intention that your esteemed Association should inform all members, based on these facts, that future insurance should be taken out with Chinese merchant companies, so that profits do not flow overseas and protection is more secure. This is our reply to the 11th District Branch of the City Federation.</p>
<h3>This Year's Fish Market Value Plummets; Japanese Fishing Vessels Seize Opportunity to Encroach</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the value of fish in the market has plummeted this year, according to the Municipal Fisheries Guidance Institute. Although the catch is still abundant, fishermen are still suffering. The total quantity of fish produced last month was 237,143 dan, valued at 1,287,308.53 foreign dollars. This included large yellow croaker, small yellow croaker, starry fish, shad, and other refrigerated fish. The production volume was greater than in the same month last year, but the value was lower. For example, the quantity of large yellow croaker increased by 12,403 dan compared to the same month last year, but the value decreased by 214,678.25 foreign dollars. The same applies to other fish products. As for Japanese fishing vessels, although there have been no apparent imports in the past two months, according to the institute's inquiries with fishing vessel crew members and commercial vessel drivers traveling to Shanghai, a large number of Japanese fishing vessels have been witnessed seizing our country's territorial waters and fishing rights. Furthermore, according to visitors from Shengshan, the nets and fishing lines of our country's coastal fixed-net fishing industry have been destroyed by Japanese fishing vessels rushing about. Fishermen have suffered incalculable losses, and it is said that this type of fixed-net fishing is about to disappear from the waters near Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Pursues Debt, Bites Off Mistress's Left Ear; The Inside Story is Incomplete and Untrue, Including a Blood Oath with a Severed Finger</h3>
<p>Tao A Mao, a 37-year-old Nanjing native, works as a laborer in the Shanghai Municipal Council Engineering Department. He lives with his wife, Lin Mei, at 1219 Siwen Lane, North Gate. His wife does laundry and mending to supplement the household income. Li Yichen, a Shandong native in his thirties, is a watchman and patrolman at the Shanghai Bank's Lao Zha Bridge No. 2 warehouse. He is unmarried. Two years ago, Li became acquainted with Lin Mei when he asked her to mend his dirty clothes. Soon, Li felt his life was monotonous and was attracted to Lin Mei,</p>
<h3>Who Possessed Some Beauty.</h3>
<p>Li began to send her gifts and took advantage of opportunities to seduce her. Before long, Lin Mei succumbed to petty greed and was seduced by Li, becoming his mistress. Later, the two often met in hostels for secret trysts. In July of last year, Tao suddenly lost his job and was unemployed at home. He was depressed and became ill, bedridden. His wife, Lin Mei, facing a difficult economic situation at home, borrowed 40 foreign dollars from Yichen to pay for her husband's medical treatment. Before long, Tao recovered from his illness, but because he had been unemployed for a long time and had no income, he was unable to repay Li.</p>
<h3>Unable to Repay.</h3>
<p>Recently, Li became angry because he had repeatedly demanded repayment from Tao without success. He threatened to shoot Lin Mei's entire family. Lin Mei was frightened and, with her husband's consent, moved to 1333 San Tai Wharf Road, South City, last month to avoid Yichen. Unexpectedly, Li discovered their new location. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, he tracked them down and confronted Tao, demanding the repayment of the debt. An argument ensued. Lin Mei, seeing the situation, intervened because Yichen had a physical relationship with her, but now he was harassing them over a mere 40 foreign dollar debt,</p>
<h3>With No Sense of Justice.</h3>
<p>She immediately stepped forward to defend her husband and began to fight with Li, angering him. He lunged forward, grabbed Lin Mei's head, and bit off half of her left ear with his teeth. Blood gushed out, and she screamed in pain. Nearby police officers heard the commotion and arrived, arresting Li and taking the injured Lin Mei to the First Precinct, First Station. During a preliminary hearing by Chief Yi, Tao and Lin Mei (29 years old) explained the situation, requesting a thorough investigation. Li Yichen confessed that he had an affair with Lin Mei two years ago, and the Tao family knew about it. At that time, Lin Mei insisted on divorcing her husband</p>
<h3>To Live with Me Until Old Age.</h3>
<p>However, for moral reasons, I refused her request. Fearing that Lin Mei suspected I had other intentions, I painfully bit off half of my left little finger in front of her and used the blood to write "Blood Oath" on a towel. I also wrote a seven-character poem in ink: "We met not long ago, our love is as heavy as a mountain. Lacking any consolation, I cut off my left finger to show my heart." This was to show her my devotion and sincerity. Afterwards, Lin Mei tricked me out of more than 300 dollars. Then, last autumn, Lin Mei borrowed another 150 foreign dollars from me and</p>
<h3>Made a Written Agreement.</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, Lin Mei and I suddenly became estranged and forgot our past relationship, treating me as a stranger. Last month, Lin Mei took advantage of my absence and, with the help of several female friends, sneaked into my house and stole her IOU and the blood-stained towel. She then fled to South City with her family. But in the end, I discovered their location and came to South City today to demand repayment, leading to the conflict. He was then ordered to prepare a document and hand it over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Fire on North Fujian Road</h3>
<p>A fire broke out suddenly at 57 San Tai Lane, North Fujian Road, yesterday at 10:30 AM. Thick smoke billowed out, and the fire was fierce. The fire brigade arrived after hearing the alarm and extinguished the fire. As a result, one building was destroyed.</p>
<h3>Record of the Inaugural Meeting of the Swine Slaughtering Trade Association</h3>

<h3>Bandmaster of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Sick Leave</h3>
<p>Mr. Mebraki, the bandmaster of the Shanghai Municipal Council's band, is currently in the Public Hospital for treatment. During his leave, all orchestral performances will be conducted by Mr. Fuya, and the brass band will be conducted by Mr. Krieg.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Cigarette and Currency Exchange Guild to Petition Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette and Currency Exchange Guild is applying to register for this season's tobacco and alcohol business license tax. Yesterday, they received a letter from the South Shanghai Branch Office stating, "To Whom It May Concern: At the recent meeting of representatives of various sections of our members, it was stated that the license tax has been collected by the Municipal Finance Bureau in accordance with the Ministry's order. Merchants should fulfill their tax obligations and apply for registration in accordance with regulations. However, most of our South Shanghai businesses are small shops run by couples with few employees who are illiterate. They do not understand the registration rules and regulations. Therefore, we should request the Association to submit a petition to the Finance Bureau, requesting them to approve the petition and issue registration forms. The Association will then forward the forms to our members for completion to avoid misunderstandings. We also request that the deadline and warning period be extended by ten days beyond the original twenty days. We also request that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce forward the request to the Municipal Government for prompt approval to facilitate the process. (Omitted below)" After receiving this letter, the Association immediately convened a standing committee meeting and resolved to appoint Chen Liangyu, Shen Weiting, Zhang Songxing, Zhang Bingyuan, Chai Yasheng, Chen Kunxian and other representatives, along with representatives from various alcohol industry groups, to go to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM today to petition for the authorities to maintain the status quo and avoid increasing the burden on the tobacco and alcohol industries.</p>
<h3>The Residents of the Eight Counties of Yangzhou are Outraged by the "Random Talk on Yangzhou" Dispute; The Association of Yangzhou Residents in Shanghai Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday; Presented to the Central Government for Justice; Scheduled to Receive the Press</h3>
<p>The Yangzhou Association of Residents in Shanghai, because the book "Random Talk on Yangzhou" written by Mr. Yi Junzuo, director of the Compilation and Examination Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, and published by the Chung Hwa Book Company, contained excessive insults to the people of Yangzhou, specially organized the "Committee to Investigate the 'Random Talk on Yangzhou' Book by the Yangzhou Residents in Shanghai", and conducted negotiations with the Chung Hwa Book Company and the author Yi Junzuo. These matters have been recorded in this newspaper. The Association held a special meeting again yesterday afternoon, resolving to present the case to the central government for justice, and scheduled a meeting to receive news reporters to report everything. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>The Association held an emergency special meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at the Yangzhou Association of Residents in Shanghai. The meeting was chaired by Hou Dachun, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Issue a statement regarding the insults to the people of Yangzhou by the Chung Hwa Book Company and the author of "Random Talk on Yangzhou," Yi Junzuo. (2) The author of "Random Talk on Yangzhou," Yi Junzuo, is currently the director of the Compilation and Examination Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and has the power to review publications throughout Jiangsu Province. The Chung Hwa Book Company's publication of "Random Talk on Yangzhou" raises suspicions of catering to and flattering Yi Junzuo, and Yi Junzuo is suspected of abusing his authority. A telegram was sent to Yangzhou, adding a charge of dereliction of duty against Yi Junzuo, director of the Compilation and Examination Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. (3) Resolved to hold the Second Congress of the Committee to Investigate the "Random Talk on Yangzhou" Book by the Yangzhou Residents in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th. (4) Telegraph to Yangzhou to send representatives to Shanghai to participate. (5) Schedule a meeting to receive the press.</p>
<h3>Reply to Chung Hwa</h3>
<p>The Association sent a letter to the Chung Hwa Book Company yesterday, stating, "To Whom It May Concern, we have received your letter of July 13th and acknowledge its contents. Publishers should carefully review the contents and wording of books before publishing them. Otherwise, even if the content involves criminal propaganda or reactionary works, they will be exempted from responsibility on the grounds of 'no preconceived notions'. Words involving libel and insult, publicly published, regardless of the truth or falsehood of the facts, bear the same legal responsibility. Therefore, your statement that it is not easy to judge the truth or falsehood cannot be used as a reason to evade responsibility. The fact that the book has now been discontinued is proof that its content and wording do indeed violate the law, no less than your own admission. So how can you explain the fact that you sacrificed our entire township's ethnic group as a tool for the book company to profit from? This matter is of the utmost importance to the character and reputation of our fellow townsmen. In addition to actively investigating all the responsibilities that your book company should bear, we find your reply in the letter unsatisfactory. We hereby inform you and hope you will take note.</p>
<h3>Presentation to the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Association telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, stating: "To the Central Party Department, the President of the Executive Yuan, the President of the Control Yuan, the Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Minister of the Ministry of Education, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Director of the Department of Education: Yi Junzuo's book "Random Talk on Yangzhou," printed and distributed by the Chung Hwa Book Company, and printed and sold by Lu Feikui on behalf of the Chung Hwa Book Company, contains the chapter "The Life of Yangzhou People," which is absurd in its wording. It uses frivolous language and fabricated facts to completely slander our entire ethnic group of Yangzhou, regardless of men, women, the living, the dead, and all other facilities, leaving no room. The insults to the women of Yangzhou are especially severe, and the most insane is the false claim that the entire national prostitution industry is run by women from Yangzhou, that all prostitutes are from the seven counties of Yangzhou, and that the traitors in the Shanghai war are also Yangzhou people. Yi Junzuo is currently the Director of the Compilation and Examination Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. The book was printed by the Chung Hwa Book Company, a nationally renowned publisher of numerous textbooks, and Lu Feikui was named as the representative of the Chung Hwa Book Company. The publication period happened to be after Yi took office as the Director of Compilation and Examination. The author did not exercise caution in his position at the center of the province's culture, and the publisher abandoned its cultural propaganda position, which it had built up over decades. The hidden circumstances are unknown, but Yi Junzuo used his power and opportunity to have the book published by the Chung Hwa Book Company. The Chung Hwa Book Company, based on its inferior nature of flattering its superiors, colluded with Yi, and the matter is extremely obvious. Someone once wrote a book insulting Muslims, and the government authorities severely punished them. The circumstances of Yi Junzuo, the Chung Hwa Book Company, and Lu Feikui are even more excessive, and they dare to try again. Not only will the people of the seven counties of Yangzhou and their descendants be shamed for generations, but if this is not severely punished according to the law, it will not only cause our government's discipline to lose its effectiveness, but also cause the division of ethnic groups in various parts of the country, and the reputation of a part of the citizens of the Republic of China will be tarnished, causing a great impact. The Association, on behalf of all Yangzhou residents in Shanghai, requests that Yi Junzuo be immediately dismissed from his post, and that he and Lu Feikui be arrested and sent to court to be severely punished according to the law for public officials' crimes. The Chung Hwa Book Company should be closed down, and all original copies of "Random Talk on Yangzhou" and unsold books should be confiscated and burned, and the book should be permanently banned from being printed, sold, and circulated. Yi Junzuo, the Chung Hwa Book Company, and Lu Feikui should be ordered to compensate the entire people of the seven counties of Yangzhou for their loss of reputation. The people of Yangzhou and the Muslims are both Chinese nationals, and your ministry should treat this reasonable request equally, follow precedents, and await orders with utmost respect. The Yangzhou Association of Residents in Shanghai salutes."</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Goods Company Offers Low Prices and High Quality; The Business is Extremely Prosperous</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Company, located opposite the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road, has recently seen ladies from all walks of life flocking to buy its goods because of its low prices and high quality.

<h3>Medical Field</h3>
<p>▲Dr. Fei Zibin's Honor: The Director of the Japanese Imperial Household Hospital, with more than ten years of chronic illness, was cured by Dr. Fei Zibin of the Menghe School. He then introduced Mrs. Wada Kihachi, the Dean of the East Asia Common Script College, who was suffering from duodenal ulcers, to Dr. Fei for treatment. Her symptoms were physical weakness, severe pain in the left chest and spine three hours after meals, accompanied by vomiting of large amounts of stomach acid. She experienced dizziness and restlessness during the pain, and the pain was more severe in winter. According to the opinions of Japanese surgeons and the diagnosis of Dr. Iwabe, the area was difficult for medication to reach, and the entire duodenum would have to be removed by surgery, with a section of the stomach connected to the esophagus to replace the duodenum. However, Mrs. Wada was afraid of the often-fatal abdominal surgery, so she decided to hire Dr. Fei for treatment. Dr. Fei prescribed two doses of detoxification and suppuration agents and two doses of blood circulation and qi-nourishing agents, and she was completely cured. She has become much healthier and fatter. Therefore, she commissioned the production of a "International Miracle Worker" plaque and asked Professor Kageyama of the hospital to present it to Dr. Fei, and said that traditional Chinese medicine is good at internal medicine, and even surgical diseases can be treated with internal medicine.</p>
<p>▲News of Free Clinic and Medicine Distribution by the Fourth Branch of the Second Special District City Federation: In order to relieve the poor and sick, the Fourth Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District City Federation in the French Concession has established a free clinic and medicine distribution center at the Yixin Temple, Bair Road.

In addition to free medical treatment, they also issue medicine certificates, which can be used to obtain medicine from the Shangshoutang Wanxiangchun Pharmacy on Bair Road free of charge. Since the opening of the clinic, more than 700 people have sought medical treatment. The association has also purchased epidemic prevention water, 500 bottles of Jizhong water donated by Shi Dezhi, 360 bottles of Baoan water donated by Lu Wenzhong, 500 bottles of Shanao water donated by Gong Jingyan, and 80 bottles of Baoan water donated by Jicheng Pharmacy, for distribution to citizens. Committee member Dong Wenli, in view of the fact that poor laborers have been seeking medical treatment from the association recently, and some are even unable to pay the registration fee, has issued free registration coupons at the Yuanyuan Business Ground on Pingjili Road, which can be used for free registration at the association, all paid for by Mr. Dong.</p>
<p>▲The Commercial and Cultural Affairs Agency Specially Establishes a Summer Medicine Delivery Group: Since its opening two weeks ago, the Commercial and Cultural Affairs Agency on Wenmiao Road has been making tireless efforts to serve the community.

<h3>No. 18 Reading News 丨Compiled by the Reading Guidance Department of the Shenbao Circulation Library 丨</h3>
<p>Table of Contents: 1. Book and Newspaper Introduction 2. Broadcast</p>
<p>Introduction to New Language Forest: This year is the year of humorous essays. Since the publication of The Analects and The Human World, dozens of publications have been advertised as humorous essays. This cannot be said to be a bad phenomenon, but their content either puts on a gentlemanly face or degenerates into low-level interests. There are almost none that can truly take on the task of humorous essays and become popular reading material. As a result, some people fundamentally deny the existence of essays in the current Chinese literary world. Although this is a misunderstanding, to resolve this misunderstanding, essays must be corrected from the aspect of discussing foxes and ghosts.</p>
<p>The New Language Forest, edited by Mr. Xu Maoyong, seems to have this tendency. Opening the first issue, Mr. Du Deji's Alienation, its deep satirical flavor and subtle touch truly make people laugh and cry. Especially in its substance, it exposes reality and educates those backward elements, which is beyond the reach of the so-called humorous essays currently in vogue. In addition, Fengzi's articles are also worth reading. Of course, this publication also has many things like "chats," such as Mr. Chen Zizhan's two prefaces, which are not very suitable for publication here. However, among the current humorous essay publications, it is still the most worthwhile to read. We hope that the editors of New Language Forest will publish more works like Alienation in the future, opening up a small path in humorous essays.</p>
<p>Broadcast: (1) This department notified readers in the 16th issue of this publication who have joined this department but have never communicated that they should explain the reasons for their communication failure to this department in the future. Although 60-70 written explanations have now been received, there are still many readers who have not reported. We hereby solemnly notify that if you still do not explain within this week, your communication qualification will be revoked.</p>
<p>(2) The special reader communication notes specially made by this department have been purchased and used by many readers. Readers have not been able to fill in the forms printed on the notes according to the boxes, and some have even filled in the library card number into the registration number of this department. In the future, we hope that readers will fill in clearly. Also, those who have not registered with this department but communicate with this department are also requested to complete the registration immediately.</p>
<p>(3) Currently, this publication is soliciting short articles from readers on their reading experiences, but very few have been submitted. We hope everyone will work hard to write them.</p>
<p>(4) Due to the hot weather, the office hours of this department have been invisibly shortened. If readers' letters are slightly delayed in replying in the future, please do not be impatient. We are equally absolutely responsible.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Mr. Liu Fu</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>The Shenbao reported on the 14th, citing a Central News Agency dispatch: "The literary scholar Liu Fu went to the Ping-Sui Railway to investigate dialects a month ago. Due to acclimatization, he returned to Ping with illness. On the 12th, his condition suddenly worsened, and he was readmitted to Xiehe Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He passed away at 2:10 PM on the 14th. According to the hospital's diagnosis, Liu suffered from jaundice. The root of the disease had been there for a long time, leading to his death. Colleagues in academic circles were deeply saddened upon hearing the news."</p>
<p>Alas! Is Mr. Liu Fu dead! After reading this special dispatch, I couldn't help but feel "sad for a long time"! But I must declare that I didn't "shed tears of sorrow." Because China has lost a linguist, and considering the sake of scholarship, how could we not feel "sad for a long time"! However, I have never met Mr. Liu in person, so hearing the news of his death, I did not dwell on old feelings and "shed tears of sorrow"!</p>
<p>About half a month ago, the Evening News carried a communication from Suiyuan, writing about Mr. Liu's lengthy conversation with this reporter. Mr. Liu talked about his past struggles for the "Literary Revolution" during the May Fourth Movement. He said with some emotion: "Now I have no courage!" We were hoping that Mr. Liu could muster the courage again to continue the struggle and participate in the Mass Language Movement. Unexpectedly, Mr. Liu fell ill and died, and we lost an opportunity to hear the opinions of a linguistic expert. Just speaking about the issue of mass language, this is also a huge loss! Moreover, Mr. Liu's trip to the Ping-Sui Railway was originally to investigate dialects, but he died due to acclimatization. His spirit of dedication to scholarship is truly admirable! Although a regional dialect is not exactly the mass language, if we want to build mass language literature, investigating and studying dialects in various parts of the country, as well as reviewing and answering dialect questions in the mass language, is also an urgent and important task. A scholar like Mr. Liu who was willing to dedicate his life to dialectology could not have his life extended, and he had to abandon his most valuable work. Shouldn't this be something that everyone engaged in the mass language movement should mourn?</p>
<p>A few days ago, I wrote two "Random Talks on New Poetry" and submitted them to the "Trends" section of the Zhonghua Daily. They were triggered by reading Mr. Liu's conversation recorded in the Evening News' Suiyuan communication. I originally planned to talk about Liu's Collection of Earthen Pots written in the Jiangyin dialect in the third section, but I didn't have this book on hand, so I couldn't write it today. Now, based on what I feel, since the emergence of new poetry, there have been more than a hundred published collections of poetry, but only Collection of Earthen Pots can be considered the first collection to be written entirely in dialect. Although it cannot be said to be a great success, compared to those Europeanized poems that people cannot understand (such as the symbolist poems that Mr. Zhao Jingshen considered "incomprehensible" in the preface to the Anthology of Modern Poetry) and the vernacular poems that pile up many classical allusions, Collection of Earthen Pots has its own unique value. Although I don't understand the Jiangyin dialect, I am greatly moved every time I read poems like "The cart rattles through the night, the water is cool, and the wind is blowing" and "Comparing people can be infuriating" in Collection of Earthen Pots. Although he is not like Mr. Liu Dabai, he writes about socialism and labor issues, but the emotional power of his Collection of Earthen Pots is above Mr. Liu Dabai's Collection of Songs of Selling Cloth. It is a pity that he refused to condescend (?) to the position of a farmer poet and did not fully shout out the bitter lives of farmers and the tragic reality of rural areas from his poems with all his life's energy. However, he has already left us with a practical report of writing new poems in dialect, which is also valuable.</p>
<p>I remember when Mr. Liu Fu was in charge of the Women's College, he announced that female students should be called "girls" and not "Miss," which aroused much ridicule and criticism. Fairly speaking, if Mr. Liu only opposed the unnecessary Europeanized elements in the vernacular language, what was wrong with that? Mr. Liu often expressed dissatisfaction with the excessively Europeanized vernacular language. In his General Theory of Chinese Grammar, he said:</p>
<p>I will now give a simple example:</p>
<p>Confucius said: "To learn and practice regularly is not a pleasure?"</p>
<p>This is too old-fashioned, not good!</p>
<p>"To learn and practice regularly," Confucius said, "is not a pleasure?"</p>
<p>This is good!</p>
<p>"To learn and practice regularly is not a pleasure?" Confucius said.</p>
<p>This is even better! Why is it good? It's Europeanized. But "Confucius said" could not be Europeanized to "Said Confucius"!</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's ridicule of the excessively Europeanized vernacular language is still the same as before. The Suiyuan communication in the Evening News carried his conversation with the reporter:</p>
<p>"Promoting the vernacular language is to make it easier for people to understand, but later it became more difficult than classical Chinese, such as excessive Europeanization and meaningless piling up."</p>
<p>He (Mr. Liu) said with great emotion about this point:</p>
<p>"This is something we didn't expect at first!"</p>
<p>That's right, "excessive Europeanization," "meaningless piling up," and "more difficult than classical Chinese" are really the major problems of the currently popular vernacular language (especially vernacular poetry). If the vernacular language had not reached such a dead end, no one would have come out to promote the mass language! Therefore, we can say that if Mr. Liu were still alive, he would one day participate in the mass language movement, or at least he would give a considerable evaluation of this movement from the perspective of a linguist. This assumption is possible. Moreover, Mr. Liu said that he "has no courage now"; in the end, he still has great courage.</p>
<p>Recently, he had a paper, the title of which I forget, about "Namo Amitabha," which was published in the Nanjing Minsheng Daily, and The Analects Monthly also reprinted it. This article of his is probably his most wonderful final work, emitting the last brilliance of his life. This proves that as long as he has life, he is not like many scholars who flatter the powerful like a living corpse who "because the corpse is difficult to decay, temporarily in the air"!</p>
<p>I would like to express my condolences here for Mr. Liu Fu's death. After writing this article, I really couldn't help but feel "sad for a long time"!</p>
<h3>Drought</h3>
<p>— Xijin</p>
<p>Millions of hearts yearn for rain,</p>
<p>Scorched, a bit of tender seedlings!</p>
<p>Looking up at a round of setting sun,</p>
<p>The evening glow declares the horror of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Occasional clouds are just deception,</p>
<p>Carrying the hope of harvest on the waterwheel.</p>
<p>Sweat from the pores keeps flowing,</p>
<p>The source of life has dried up.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Ban Nong</h3>
<p>— Shoutong</p>
<p>Yesterday I received the news of Ban Nong's death, which made me recall our meeting a year ago, and I couldn't help but shed tears of sorrow. I remember that last year was also such a summer. Ban Nong's wife returned to Jiangyin first, saying that Ban Nong was studying bells and chimes in Jinan and would return south soon. Sure enough, three days later we met Ban Nong. He even gave me two thin recent works, "Explanation of One" and "Chimes."</p>
<p>One morning we arranged to eat dim sum in Shoushan Park. My younger uncle, Jingbang, was his student, so there was a lot to talk about. Yuan Jiahua was also invited to join us because he was in Jiangyin at his wife's home. We talked about the death of his younger brother, Tianhua, and about his brother's afterlife. Perhaps Ban Nong was too sad, he said many negative things! Finally, Ban Nong also mentioned his childhood experience of not having money to study. He said very emotionally that he would donate his only inheritance—a district map (which can yield 30 shi of rice a year)—to the orphanage as an educational expense for the orphans.</p>
<p>During the meeting, I remember that there was also a student, Mr. Ji, from the Wuxi National Studies Specialized School, who asked Ban Nong many questions about national studies. Ban Nong spoke eloquently, and one could tell that he had been working hard in his studies in recent years.</p>
<p>The thing that Ban Nong talked about most enthusiastically was his professional phonology. Originally, studying Chinese phonology is very boring, but he ran around collecting materials while sweating profusely. As soon as he arrived in his long-separated hometown, he left without warming the seat, busy with work. Four days later, Ban Nong wrote from Qufu, saying that the weather was very hot, but he had obtained a lot of material on bells and chimes. We admired his hard work, but unexpectedly, a year later, his life was sacrificed for his research in the distant Bailing Temple.</p>
<p>We are still extremely grieved by Tianhua's death. Fellow musicians are even more unforgettable. But his brother, Ban Nong, has also died. No matter how the literary world will judge him, I always think Ban Nong is worth crying for.</p>
<p>What I still want to think about now is Ban Nong's wife, who is about forty years old, and two children, as well as Tianhua's family. The district map has been donated. How can they live in a five-room house in the future?</p>
<h3>Talking about Malayan Cities (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Feier</p>
<p>Johor</p>
<p>Johor, famous in the world for its romantic king.</p>
<p>The Johor Railway Bridge is very famous in Nanyang. The bridge deck is wide, long, and strong, and it has an electrically controlled opening and closing mechanism that allows ships to pass through the open iron gate at a certain stipulated time.</p>
<p>The Johor Royal Palace is built on top of a small mountain. It is surrounded by a bamboo fence with a crescent-shaped flag. It overlooks the Johor Railway Bridge, where cars and horses come and go: cars crawl like strings of tapeworms, and trains squirm on the ground like snakes. The narrow strait between Singapore and Johor is like a piece of white cloth, and the distance of the railway bridge is a blur. At night, a sea breeze makes people's spirits clear from the long days of sleep at the equator, and the moon will turn the earth into a charming scene.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is due to the influence of this charming scenery that the Kingdom of Johor was gently tamed under the British Empire. The King of Johor has now become an empty shell, and the fertile land of Johor has been almost completely presented to the hands of European and American industrialists. As a result, the King of Johor receives a certain salary per year, which is regarded as the price of presenting the territory; and in addition to being directed to sign his name on various notices and orders, he can only roam the world with his English wife. If he doesn't make himself a "romantic king", what else do you want him to do, and what can he do? (The End)</p>
<h3>To</h3>
<p>— Shao Guanhua</p>
<p>I drifted away with your eyes and died</p>
<p>When the new mud slipped and hurt your tender waist</p>
<p>I wanted to hold you and walk, like the sea</p>
<p>Holds the swallows. I slept immersed in your</p>
<p>Shy kisses, like a small boat</p>
<p>Swinging in the lake, now I suck</p>
<p>Your gaze, and weep silently like</p>
<p>Wrinkles suddenly blowing up in the red clouds,</p>
<p>When you walked away with the shadow of the bamboo branch.</p>
<h3>My Translation of "History of the Development of European Literature"丨Reactions to "On Re-translation and Others"丨</h3>
<p>— Shen Qiyu</p>
<p>It is rare to buy Shen Bao on the streets of Guangzhou. Today, I happened to get the June 30th issue and saw a lengthy article in the "Free Talk" section by my friend Mu Mutian, which touched upon my translation of "History of the Development of European Literature" and my friend Wang Renshu's "Sociological Art Theory." The publication of both books has some connection to Mu Mutian, so even someone like me, who hasn't written in a year, wants to say a few words.</p>
<p>(Middle omitted) My "History of the Development of European Literature" also has some connection to Mu Mutian. I knew the difficulty of re-translation—especially re-translation from Japanese—so before putting pen to paper, I borrowed the Russian original from Mr. Shiro Omura. However, I don't know Russian, but I knew that Mu Mutian had studied it on his own, so while sweating profusely—it was a hot summer—I searched through the various countries' literary histories in the Oriental Library to find those vast book titles and names that often defied common sense... I should have also taken the Russian text to ask Mu Mutian for guidance. But unfortunately, the word Woruku in the book was neither French nor Japanese, and I didn't have the complete works of Vigny at hand, which made it impossible for me to know that this word meant "wolf," and it also made the person I consulted the other day now discover my "funny mistake," and even come up with the humor that "this wolf traveled to Russia, then traveled to Japan, and then traveled to China, and became Mr. Alke" (?), which I cannot help but feel. Of course, I also know that old friends like Mu Mutian would never make malicious accusations, especially since there are also complimentary words such as "quite faithful" and "this point is naturally the mistake of the Japanese translator." However, a mistake is a mistake after all; when Mu Mutian or others have a more complete translation, my translation will automatically be withdrawn.</p>
<p>According to Mu Mutian's opinion on re-translation,</p>
<p>it is "to act with caution, and it is best to base it on translations in more than two languages." Although I am ignorant, I also know the importance of this point. However, Omura Shiro told me at the time that there were no English, German, French, or other translations of "History of the Development of European Literature," and his translation seemed to be the first of its kind, so I had to take the "expedient" approach as Mu Mutian said (remainder omitted).</p>
<h3>I Come From the East (1) Parting Washington in Blossom Season</h3>
<p>— Hoshino</p>
<p>Cherry blossoms are in full bloom outside Washington City, and tourists flock to both sides of the Potomac River. Once a year, it is another opportunity for the Japanese to promote "Japanese-American friendship." Because the cherry trees in Washington were a gift from the former Mayor of Tokyo. At that time, Ambassador Saito, who had not been in Washington for long, and his so-called beautiful wife, wore long-sleeved Japanese clothes and led two round, flat-faced children, running back and forth under the cherry blossoms with great pride, showing smiling faces to the tourists. They even published photos taken under the cherry blossoms in American newspapers. During those days, many Japanese goods stores in Washington used cherry blossoms as decorations on their windows. And at every intersection, there were arrow-shaped signs that read: "Cherry Blossom Season is here! Everyone go to the Potomac River to see the cherry blossoms!"</p>
<p>However, this year's cherry blossom season has not been very helpful in promoting the so-called "Japanese-American friendship." Of course, the people of Washington's enthusiasm for cherry blossoms is no less than in previous years, and Ambassador Saito's smile is much more pleasing than that of his predecessor, Ambassador Debuchi! However, Tokyo was then promoting the so-called Asian Monroe Doctrine, wanting the United States to withdraw from the Far East. Americans were tired of Japan playing tricks in the dark; they knew that Saito's smile was forced and hypocritical. An atmosphere of disgust for Japan permeated the United States. And the cherry blossoms of Washington lost a lot of their political function.</p>
<p>The actions of the Japanese in the United States, no matter how small, contain some political function. Their propaganda work is all-pervasive. For example, last year, at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, a Japanese silk tycoon used Japanese silk to make many small pieces of the American flag; distributing them to American tourists. On the one hand, he encouraged them to buy more Japanese silk goods, and on the other hand, he invisibly linked the American's patriotism and goodwill towards Japan. Moreover, when the anti-Japanese sentiment was at its strongest in the United States last year, Japan sent many college students to the United States to show many inexplicable films: inside, they either exposed the corruption and barbarism of the Chinese army, government, and society, or they exaggerated the progress of Japanese construction in Manchuria. They also like to do some small favors to cater to the Americans' preferences. Like sending Japanese stone carvings to various universities; shipping Japanese cherry trees to American cities. The cost is low, and the propaganda value is great. The cherry trees in Washington City have been sent from Japan for many years. This year, a new park was completed in New York, and another large batch of cherry trees was shipped from Tokyo.</p>
<p>Although this year's cherry blossom season in Washington is relatively lacking in political meaning, its artistic meaning is undeniable. On the clear banks of the Potomac River, the willows hang with golden threads. The cherry blossoms are in full bloom like snow, looking a little pink from a distance. Under the trees is a trimmed lawn. When you lean on the railing by the river for a short rest, and look at the Lincoln Memorial made of white stone outside the cherry forest, and the Washington Monument, more than five hundred feet high, reflected in the water. In the slow spring sunshine, it forms a quiet and beautiful picture. You will not believe that just a few feet away is the bustling and noisy center of Washington City.</p>

The morning session was from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., then a break was announced. In the afternoon, discussions continued from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., and the handling of the cases of each group was completed. Today (the 15th), the general assembly will be held at 9:30 a.m., and the closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon. The results of the group meetings on that day are recorded in detail below,</p>
<h3>Special Group Meeting</h3>
<p>The Special Committee held a meeting at 6:30 a.m. in the classroom (Humanities Building), chaired by Jiang Hengyuan. The attendees were Huang Yanpei, Zhong Daozan, Tang Ying, Yang Weiyu, Wu Ziqiang, Cheng Shihui, Cheng Shiwei, Zou Shuwen, and Jiang Hengyuan. ㈠ Discussed the method of reviewing the society's proposals. 1. Based on the opinions expressed by the colleagues, when the group meetings are held, observe the nature of the proposals and participate separately. 2. If the discussion results of each proposal require the drafting of a plan by a member, it is hoped that it can be drafted in a timely manner. If this is not possible, it can also be handed over to the Vocational Education Society Office for handling. 3. Identify the central issues. The standards for central issues are as follows: 1. Greater possibility; 2. Emphasis on action; 3. Suitability to needs. 4. Based on the previous standards, two central issues are proposed as follows: 1. Social vocational remedial education; 2. Youth training issues in rural improvement and inter-party liaison issues. The previous issues must be strictly based on the scope of vocational education. 5. The time limit for determining the central issues is tentatively set at three years, and Jiangxi Province will be a special experimental area (especially in the two matters of youth service and remedial education). 6. In order to ensure agile contact between all parties, the Society will set up a communication agency. One, on the reply to President Chiang's telegram, Mr. Wu Ziqiang was recommended to draft it.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Pan Kung-chan, Master of Ceremonies Peng Chu-chi, Recorders Chou Hsien-chu and Chou Chao-nan. The ceremony was performed as scheduled. First, Chairman reported the results of the joint entrance examination, briefly stating that there were 1,403 students from 51 senior high schools and 2,147 students from 72 junior high schools participating in this year's examination, totaling 3,550 people. The results showed that 951 students from senior high schools passed, accounting for 67%, and 1,612 students from junior high schools passed, accounting for 75%, for a total of 2,563 students passing. According to regulations, all should participate in the graduation ceremony. However, due to the fact that some have already left Shanghai and some have taken college entrance examinations, they cannot attend today. The above refers to general academic subjects. In addition, the number of vocational subject graduates who did not participate in the examination is not yet certain because the schools have not yet reported to the Education Bureau, but it is roughly estimated to be around 1,000 people. It is estimated that there are more than 3,500 graduates this year. The Education Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government and the Ministry of Education to include award standards in the examination regulations. Students who score A in each subject and rank in the top three in overall average will be awarded scholarships and certificates. Students who score B or higher in each subject and rank in the A grade in overall average will be awarded certificates. Schools with A grade performance will also be awarded certificates.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Admonitory Speech</h3>
<p>Following this, the Mayor presented certificates and delivered an admonitory speech, briefly stating that the reason why the joint graduation ceremony for middle schools is held at the Municipal Government is because we consider the joint graduation ceremony for middle schools to be a very important event. You all know that there are 450 million people in China, and very few have the opportunity to study. Even fewer have the opportunity to receive higher education. Therefore, we believe that your graduation from middle school is hard-earned and deserves a grand ceremony. From now on, the joint graduation ceremony for all schools in Shanghai will be held at the Municipal Government every year. After graduation, some of you will pursue further studies and some will seek employment. But whether you pursue further studies or seek employment, never forget the kindness of the nation, society, parents, and elders towards you. Always strive to repay them. Those who will pursue further studies must study diligently and not give up halfway. After acquiring advanced knowledge, dedicate what you have learned to the nation and society, so that the nation and society will have one more citizen with advanced knowledge and gain more benefits. Those who will seek employment in the future must also be very loyal to the nation and society and contribute your knowledge and abilities. This is how you will not fail the cultivation of the nation, society, parents, and elders, and this is how you will repay their kindness. Today, China is in extreme danger, and the people of the whole country are in a state of instability. It is just like a dilapidated house and a broken boat, swaying in the wind and rain, amidst the surging waves. If we want to save it, we must have the people of the whole country united and of one mind. Especially those who are educated should bear more responsibility. You must understand that today is not a time to enjoy comfort, but a time to endure hardship and bide our time. It is a time to make meals, not a time to eat meals. It is a time to build houses, not a time to live in houses. At present, everyone wants to eat ready-made meals and live in ready-made houses, which has led to everyone having no food to eat and no houses to live in. Therefore, we must create a new world. Those who study agriculture should go to the countryside, those who study engineering should do engineering, and those who study mining should do mining. Do not all go down the same path. Whether you seek employment or pursue further studies, if you can recognize this point clearly, the future of the country will be bright. Only then will you not fail the cultivation of the nation, society, parents, and elders, and only then will you have repaid their kindness.</p>
<h3>Party Department Address</h3>
<p>Tao Pai-chuan, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, stated briefly that the Mayor just said that whether you pursue further studies or seek employment, you must repay the nation and society. But among you, there must be many who cannot pursue further studies and have no jobs to take. How should we strive to repay them? Ordinary people think that not being able to pursue further studies means dropping out of school. This is wrong. Pursuing further studies certainly provides an opportunity to study, but not being able to pursue further studies also allows you to study. After graduating from junior high school, you have a small foundation in various subjects and can study on your own. Rather than going to a depressed school, it is better to study on your own at home. Many famous people in society have never attended college but have become famous. Secondly, there is unemployment. At your age, there is no talk of unemployment. Your age is not the time for employment, but the time for study. That is, you must not drop out of school. Studying on your own at home is not unemployment. Moreover, careers must be created by oneself. In the countryside, you can educate children under thatched roofs. In the city, you can set up public schools near factories. As long as you actually do it, you don't have to worry about society not helping. Finally, we must understand that the fundamental reason why China has come to this point is the aggression of imperialism. We must work hard to abolish unequal treaties and drive out the forces of imperialism. Only then can we pursue further studies and seek employment.</p>
<h3>Guest Speakers</h3>
<p>Next, guest speakers addressed the audience. Wu Hsing-ya, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated briefly that China is now in a semi-colonial position. Since the September 18th Incident, the national crisis has become even more serious. The Chinese problem has led to the inability to maintain world peace and the inevitability of world war. When this world war breaks out, the elderly and middle-aged will of course stand at the forefront and sacrifice themselves to seek survival for the country and the nation. But those who continue the elderly and middle-aged to seek survival for the country and the nation are actually the young students. You must constantly work hard. In the world war, you are the new life of the Chinese nation. The responsibility of revitalizing the nation and building the country rests on you. I pray that you will work hard. Liao Mao-ju, Liu Chan-en, Chen Jen-ho, and others also spoke. The speeches were lengthy and will be omitted.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3 Starting the Match丨Serving</h3>
<p>▲ Research on Serving Posture, Technique, and Direction of Force</p>
<p>Serving is the beginning of each game in a match. Players should use a draw to determine who has the right to serve first (it is generally considered that serving first is beneficial). This privilege is granted to the opponent only after the end of one game, and is enjoyed alternately in each game until the end of the match.</p>
<p>When serving, players are subject to extreme restrictions. At this time, they should stand in the designated position, with both feet not crossing the baseline or touching the baseline. The serving position should be in the middle of the baseline and the sideline, alternating between right and left. The ball served should pass over the net and land within the opponent's diagonal service area before the receiver returns the ball.</p>
<p>The biggest restriction for the server is that the ball served can only land in a very narrow position in the opponent's court. Unlike ordinary shots, the opponent's court is completely open. When serving, the ball can only land within the opponent's diagonal service area. This service area only accounts for about one-quarter of the entire court. However, due to the obstruction of the net, a large part of the service area near the net is completely useless. The area where the ball can land is only the 5 or 6 feet of the court behind. Therefore, in reality, it only accounts for one-tenth of the entire court.</p>
<p>When serving, it is important to hit the ball very hard so that it flies out quickly and passes over the net, landing in the designated service area in the opponent's court. At this time, an attacking method must be used to quickly land the ball in a position that is difficult for the receiver to deal with. The server's agile attack and the receiver's agile response are both important parts of tennis technique.</p>
<p>The server has two chances to serve. Therefore, taking advantage of this point, many people who can hit the ball take the opportunity to make the first ball served fierce and difficult to receive. But if the first serve is unfortunately missed, it is even more important to concentrate and be careful, and not to repeat the same mistake the second time, thus losing a point. Because continuing to miss the serve twice counts as losing one point. The actual serving method used today is to throw the ball upwards, raise the arm high, pass over the head, and hit. If this is the case, both feet should be parallel to the trajectory of the ball, and the body should be sideways to the net, as if hitting in the court. Therefore, the left foot (for a player serving with the right hand) should be placed just behind the baseline. When hitting the ball, it is like a woodcutter holding an axe to chop a tree, but another hand cannot be used to help.</p>
<p>Since there are two chances to serve, the server should hold two balls in his left hand, or even three at the same time (but the author does not approve of holding three). When preparing to serve, one ball is held in the palm of the left hand, and the other ball is clamped between the thumb and forefinger. At this time, the technique is to throw the ball exactly into the predetermined hitting space. Therefore, long-term training is required to be able to do this as desired each time. When the ball has already been thrown into the air, it is too late to move the body to hit it, and moving will definitely affect the hitting and cause a miss.</p>
<p>When beginners serve, it is a very big mistake to hold only one ball in the left hand, but they prefer to do so, and do not pay attention to the consequences of this bad habit. You must know that the first mistake in serving is unexplainable, so the second one should be sent out immediately, simply and without looking around to change the position. It is already extremely difficult for the server to accurately determine the place where the ball will land and estimate the angle, speed, and trajectory of the ball. Therefore, after the calculation has been done, if there is a mistake the first time, the second time it is necessary to discover the original orientation. If only one ball is held in the left hand, then after the first mistake, it is necessary to move the position to pick up another ball. As a result, the angle in the eye will naturally change when serving for the second time, and the result of the second time may be worse than the first.</p>

<h3>A Record of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty Translated by Qin Shou-ou</p>
<p>I never expected him to joke with me, and I didn't even notice if he had knelt down himself. I believed it was true and fell down with a thud. Later, everyone laughed, and I realized that I had been tricked. Perhaps the Empress Dowager hadn't even gotten up yet! Poor Guangxu, in name he was an emperor, but how lonely and sad he was! He could only find some happiness from such childish and insignificant jokes, which was so tragic! At that time, I was deceived by him, and I laughed with him once, but after thinking about it, I couldn't help but cry for him! I can say categorically that apart from this kind of boring joke, he couldn't find any more happiness. He couldn't do the things he loved to do in his heart, but he had to do the things he didn't love to do. In short, no matter where he went, he was always a prisoner!</p>
<p>Our train had to stop at night. Probably the movement of the train at night would inevitably disturb the Empress Dowager's peace. Once the train stopped, all sounds also disappeared. In this way, could the Empress Dowager rest peacefully? No, no. With the Empress Dowager's dignity, how could she be exposed in the wilderness without any defense! Therefore, every time our train stopped, a train of soldiers following closely behind would also stop. Hundreds of fully armed guards were busy climbing out of the darkness and quietly setting up sentries around our train. And the (Guangxu's car also had huge blue dragons painted on both sides.) two cars next to the Empress Dowager and Guangxu were guarded especially closely, simply completely surrounded. However, the Empress Dowager herself could still get off the train freely, as long as she was happy. But Guangxu could not cross the line, and no one else was allowed to go up. It can be said that he was completely isolated from all people and things in the world, no different from a lonely ghost in solitude. Only in his dreams could he temporarily jump out of this big circle where evil demons were hiding everywhere. (84)</p>
<h3>Mulberry Picking Girl</h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>Every season when the first silkworms spin their silk, I think of the mulberry picking girls with cloths wrapped around their foreheads. They are all diligent and frugal women who can endure hardship. They get up early in the morning and sleep late at night, and they can't sleep well at night either. At least they have to feed the silkworms with mulberry leaves three or four times.</p>
<p>In the morning, before the sun comes out of the mountains, they wrap those cloths around their foreheads, taking advantage of the dew on the mulberry leaves that hasn't been dried by the sun, and go to pick mulberries one by one without even combing their hair. Those who travel long distances carry a dry food bag to fill their hunger along the way. Among these mulberry picking girls, it can be said that there are simple, pretty, old, and young ones, but they are mostly healthy young women. They don't need men to help them pick. Their physique is much stronger than that of men in our cities! And that kind of diligent and healthy virtue really makes the fashionable girls in the city who wear long cheongsams and put on yellow rouge feel ashamed!</p>
<p>Sometimes, their gentle demeanor can easily touch the hearts of every young and passionate man. They often use a moving tone to sing a southern country love song. Sometimes, when they hear their tones, they can't help but sing back to each other. But they will never shamelessly allow a man to find a secluded mountain depression and indulge in licentiousness like those southern barbarians. But the anecdotes of "Sangjian Pushang" may not be absent.</p>
<p>But in recent years, under the pressure of the rural economic bankruptcy, the poor rural women are in a hurry to think about how to fill their empty stomachs first. They seem to have little leisure to think about flirting.</p>
<h3>The Eighteen Scenic Spots of Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Nan Gong Sheng</p>
<p>People who visit West Lake in Hangzhou all know that West Lake has eighteen scenic spots. Few know that Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou also has a legend of eighteen scenic spots. However, the eighteen scenic spots of West Lake are natural landscapes, so they still exist today and can be pointed out. The eighteen scenic spots of Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, however, are partly man-made and partly lost, and there is no definite research, so they have been lost and are not taken seriously. According to the legend, the eighteen scenic spots of Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou are: the Wordless Tablet, the Large Water Vat, the Hexagonal Pavilion Pillar Bases, the Five Hundred Arhats, the Stone Railing with Nails, the Miro Pavilion, the Terrace, the Three Pure Ones Bodhisattva, the Stone Pillar, the Soaring Furnace, the Bronze Man, Mount Wudang, the "Wonderful Unity of Origin" Plaque, the Twin Wells, the Heng and Ha Generals, the White Bark Poplar, Niu Jiao Bang Urine Buckets, and the Old Woman Buying Thread at the Main Entrance. However, most of them can no longer be seen today.</p>
<p>The Wordless Tablet, the Large Water Vat, the Terrace, the Three Pure Ones Bodhisattva, the "Wonderful Unity of Origin" Plaque, and the Heng and Ha Generals are six scenic spots that anyone who goes to Xuanmiao Temple can see. The Miro Pavilion has been burned down, and the Zhongshan Hall has now been rebuilt. The stone pillars are the stone pillars of the Miro Pavilion, and they are all elaborately crafted with two arms' span, so naturally they were also destroyed in the fire. The Twin Wells are on the side of the abbot's room. Mount Wudang is an antique in the Ancestor Hall. There was a fact that Taoists wanted to steal and sell it before. The Bronze Man is also an antique in the Ancestor Hall. The Stone Railing with Nails is a stone railing on the terrace, covered with iron nails. The Hexagonal Pavilion Pillar Bases are on the side of the Sanfang Chang Tea House. These seven scenic spots can be found with careful investigation. The Soaring Furnace was a large incense burner in front of the Miro Pavilion, but it is no longer there. The White Bark Poplar was burned to death along with the Miro Pavilion during the fire. The Five Hundred Arhats were built on the roof ridges of the main entrance of Xuanmiao Temple and the Three Pure Ones Hall, but now they are also fragmented and cannot be seen again. As for the two scenic spots, Niu Jiao Bang Urine Buckets and the Old Woman Buying Thread at the Main Entrance, let alone now, they cannot be seen. Even twenty years ago, they were already gone. It's just that in the past, dozens of urine buckets were lined up in the Niu Jiao Bang area, and from the main entrance to below the terrace, they were full of old women selling thread, so they became two scenic spots. How can they be seen again today?</p>
<h3>General Mobilization</h3>
<h3>Rowing the Incense Boat</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The inland cities and villages are indeed too lifeless. Here, there are many temple fairs and incense festivals to embellish them. Therefore, a layer of liveliness floats on the dull streets. Prohibiting superstition and overthrowing theocracy are out of the question in rural society.</p>
<p>During each incense festival, the owner of the incense boat holds the most special power. They support a bare-backed boat, rocking from east village to west village, gathering many Taoist priests and nuns, and heading to their destination in the sound of oars.</p>
<p>Although the life of rowing the incense boat can earn a few copper coins from the yellow cloth pocket of every old woman, the most annoying thing is waiting for the Taoist nuns to board the boat, taking incense, taking food, greeting you, I look at you, first gather on the shore, and then a wooden fish, a cry of Amitabha, slowly like a car slowly running on the boat. In the splashing of water and the sound of oars, the Taoist nuns sit on both sides of the boat's gunwale, very devoutly knocking on wooden fish, chanting Buddhist scriptures, and adjusting the silent air to move forward. After each Buddhist chant, there can be a lot of conversations. What they say is either that Wang's sister-in-law in the village is stealing a man, or how badly Li's old woman treats her daughter-in-law. The owner of the boat only knows to row forward, and everything else is not in his heart.</p>
<p>The inland incense period is today in Dongzhen and tomorrow in Xicun, so the Taoist nuns can burn incense one after another. The owner of the incense boat also works in order. They not only get the fare from the Taoist nuns, but also get special wine money from the temple host. Their life is comfortable and open. This way of making a living is indeed a special occupation in the countryside.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirty-Two: The General Indulges in Pleasure All Day Long; Few Soldiers Return Amidst the Cries of Old and Young.</p>
<p>Gui Zhi saw that this matter seemed not unrelated. Taking advantage of the time to collect the Lantern Festival items and go to the wall lattice, she took out the tea jar, poured fragrant tea leaves into it with boiling water from the kettle on the stove in the room, and then, after rolling the tobacco leaves, and lighting the lamp, gave them all to Zhao Weng, and poured a cup of hot tea, placing it on the corner of the table next to Zhao Weng. Only then did she retreat to the chair opposite and sit down. Zhao Weng drank a cup of tea, first speaking to the Jiang family, who was sitting next to him, "Old Madam, it's not that I'm praising you, but your daughter is really well-educated. These days, people's hearts are too malicious; just a simple comparison brings out the good people." Hearing these words, Jiang was confused, not knowing where they came from. She smiled and said, "You're still saying that; the child is a member of your family, whether she's good or bad is your family's business. Old Master, you love your son, and in turn, you love your daughter-in-law." Zhao Weng said, "There's a reason I'm saying this; why would I just blindly praise my own children? Speaking of this, he sighed again and said, "People's hearts are really hard to tell. That Miss Huang Manying and Company Commander Tian were very close; according to what people saw, there was no problem with them marrying, right? Look, I'm also seeing a big change in people's hearts. I'm even using a new term." Hearing these words, Gui Zhi understood a bit in her heart. Actually, it wasn't anything surprising; she had known for a long time that Huang Manying had a cousin. But she couldn't reveal this first, so she straightened her face and said, "What's wrong with her?" Zhao Weng said, "It's something no one would have expected; she's become friends with Gan Erye." Hearing these words, Gui Zhi really didn't believe it, but she still held her breath and listened. Zhao Weng said, "If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. Just last night, I saw Gan Erye walking down the street arm-in-arm with her." Jiang quickly glanced at Gui Zhi, and then replied to Zhao Weng, "How would they know each other?" Zhao Weng said, "That's what I'm saying. When I met the two of them last night, it was Miss Huang who greeted me first, so I naturally stood there and talked." (435)</p>

<h3>A Tour of Europe</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>▲ Letter from Berlin (Part 1)</p>
<p>While in retreat at the Maranouchi Monastery in Belgium, I received a letter from Berlin, Germany. The sender was Mrs. E. Schnider, who lives in Leuven. Her husband is the secretary of the Belgian envoy to Germany. Knowing that I am an admirer of metropolises, she especially described the scenery of Berlin in her letter. I have long yearned for the major cities of Eastern Europe, and if I have the opportunity in the future, I would very much like to go to Berlin, Vienna, Budapest, and other places on an art tour. Below is a depiction of Berlin translated from Mrs. Schnider's letter.</p>
<p>Berlin is one of the most modern cities in the world, a bustling metropolis. From morning to night, the sounds of the city are noisy everywhere, and the wheels and whistles of cars are constantly rolling and whistling there.</p>
<p>Such a capital is the center of the outstanding people of a strong country, and the hub that demonstrates the strong Germanic spirit.</p>
<p>Near the central station, the scenes that have already begun to move early in the morning, and the bright red and green advertising posters, are dazzling. The number of residents in a single city is almost equal to the entire population of Belgium, which will of course arouse endless interest from a curious Belgian tourist.</p>
<p>We are now under the bronze statue of William I, surrounded by other bronze statues stained with green. Not far from here, you can see the vast Schloss villa, with its Greek temple-style facade and jungle-like stone pillars.</p>
<p>When crossing the streets, it is best to always walk on the yellow sidewalk, because the traffic on the road is constant. If you are not careful, you may lose your life. We should admire the precision of the road administration facilities. Although the traffic on the road is very congested, there are no police officers to be seen. Various vehicles obey the command of the special lights, and the order is orderly and without confusion. What a solemn and beneficial discipline!</p>
<p>Everywhere, there are interlaced vehicles, elevated trams, buses, freight cars, cars, and bicycles: browsing these disciplined people almost makes people forget the time to eat. The various restaurants make it difficult to choose to follow, and the ingenious food on the menu makes people sigh. If you have the opportunity to come to Berlin to eat, I recommend a good thing. Do not forget to taste the taste of Delicaiesses de la Baltigue!</p>
<p>You want to know how much it costs? When you settle the bill, you will definitely lengthen your face:::</p>
<p>After dinner, go to a dessert shop for tea. This dessert shop has seven large living rooms and seven orchestras. In the not vaserland restaurant, the layout is very beautiful. In a corner of the hall, we can overlook the artificial natural scenery, a panoramic view of the Alps, the banks of the Rhine River, and the sudden sunrise, and the sudden wind and rain. We can see real rain and lightning:::</p>

<h3>September Contract for Gold Bar Opens High, Falls Instead; Increase in Bullish Chips in August; Total of 17,528 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was unsettled. It was initially firm but then weakened. The day's trend was high then low. Banks continued to sell, but the exchange market tightened. Gold prices were also in a golden era. Finally, the domestic market was extremely flat, and confidence waned. Gradually falling, until it broke five yuan, it lacked the strength to recover. In the early morning, overseas silver market rose in England but was flat in the US. The five metal exchanges closed for deferred silver prices. Exchange rate slightly rose. London raw gold fell half a pence. US cotton fell ten pounds, and US wheat rose one and one-eighth cents. When the off-market preparation trading did not open, the swap was initially around four yuan. Spot number Ying Feng Heng sold cheaper, and Guangbang even more bravely sold out, and the swap retreated to two and a half yuan. Confidence waned, and the gold price fell to 84 yuan after opening. Later, as bargain hunters poured in, the swap gradually stabilized, and the gold price pulled up. After opening, confidence was firm, and traders forcefully bought US dollars, and the exchange market tightened and rose, but it was still struggling. When the domestic market tightened further, HSBC listed that England and the US were both flat and even rose, but the bank's appetite was still selling, and the supply turned surging with the high price, gradually falling. Although there were many maintainances in the middle, the afternoon trend was still difficult to revive. The afternoon market opened stably. Although the exchange market was flat, people still felt weak. Once five yuan was broken, even with the news that Mumbai fell 1.2.1 anna, it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. Large households bought in at low prices, and once rebounded. However, the clear indication that it was easy to fall and difficult to rise was clear. The closing price was the lowest. The whole day's market was quite mediocre. August/September swap was offered with a two and a half to four yuan advance for buying. The number of transactions was quite high. Fuchang found an increase in August taels. The price of pure gold was 996.3 yuan, adding 14 yuan and change for Tianjin goods, and adding slightly less than 13 yuan for Dongbei goods. Now I will record the day's market situation.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 985.3 yuan, a decrease of 5.8 jiao compared to last Saturday. Adding the swap calculation, the price was reduced by more than one yuan. The article opened at five and a half yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 1 shilling 4 pence 1875 for English exchange and 34.125 yuan for US exchange. In preparation trading, the lowest price was four yuan, which was the selling of Guangbang, and the swap was cheap. After the opening, the sentiment was quite good. Although it retreated to 5.2 yuan, the 5 yuan level was difficult to break through. Therefore, Yongli, Qianchangxiang, Senchangyong, Tianfengshui, Fuyu, Yuanmaoyong, Richang, Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, Yicheng, Yingfenghang and others bought. The exchange market also tightened due to traders buying, and rose to 7.8 yuan. Zhengjin came out, selling September US dollars at 1875, and Dingtai, Fuyu, and Futaiheng sold taels, falling to 6.5 yuan. Yongli and Yingfenghang continued to buy. At this time, the Dalian gang sold and hovered around 7 yuan. Yongli, Yingfenghang, Tongyi, Yuqingyong, Yongde, Yuanmaoyong, etc. bought again. It was learned that HSBC's listing had not moved, and it rose to 8.6 yuan. Mitsui and others sold 25 in October US dollars. Fuxingyong, Fuyu, Yuqingyong, and Yuanmaoyong came to sell and retreated to 6.9 yuan. Yongli and Huixiang bought forcefully and rose to around 8 yuan. The article Yuqingyong, Yongde, and Dekang continued to sell, gradually falling to 6.5 yuan. At this time, Sassoon made a shilling purchase, and the sentiment was still stable. Chengkang, Fuan, Yuanyi, and Zhaofengchang slightly bought, and were able to pull it up. However, Fuxingyong supplied taels from time to time, and struggled around 7 yuan for a long time. After entering, the sentiment was more tired. Mitsui and Huabi came out with 25 in October US dollars. Fuxingyong, Fuyu, Yuanmaoyong, Shenyu, Dingkang, and Yuanchangyong all had a supply, gradually retreating to 5.7 yuan. Qingfayong and Yuqingyong bought, and once rebounded to above 7 yuan, but because Yongli bought and then sold, the article was sold at 5.6 yuan, and it weakened after the closing.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 985.9 yuan, and the article opened at 5.7 yuan. Fuyu and others sold slightly, for 5.6 yuan. Chunyuan Yongheng Yu Yuanmaoyong bought, rising to 6.4 yuan. Yuanchun Fuyu Dadecheng Yuanyi Shunmao Fuxingyong Qingfayong sold. Zhejiang came out with 3125 in October US dollars, falling to 4.6 yuan. Mumbai fell one anna. Tianfeng and the Dalian gang successfully bought taels, rising to 5 yuan. Sentiment had already weakened, and it was difficult to reverse the overall situation. Dadecheng Yuanchun came to sell and fell again to 3.6 yuan. The domestic market was flat, and there were many bargain hunters. Bingxing bought taels and was flat. Yuanyi Tongtaichang Qianchangxiang bought again, and rebounded to 4.8 yuan. Hengtai Hengyu Fuxingyong Dadecheng Shunli and others sold from time to time, and the trend was difficult to revive. When the market closed, it fell to 983.2 yuan, and the article was sold at 3.3 yuan. After the market closed, Bingxing Tianfeng Yongyongli Yuanyi all bought, rising to 3.5 yuan. Hongxing and others sold, still seeing Qingping. The highest price for the day was 988.6 yuan, and the lowest price was 983.2 yuan, with a fluctuation of 5.4 yuan. As a result, it fell 7.9 yuan compared to last Saturday. Adding the swap difference of 4 yuan, it fell 3.9 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was the same as HSBC Bank's US dollar listing, still 33.625 yuan, combining for a gold bar of 1029 yuan. According to the closing price, the price was about 46 yuan weak, less than 8 yuan more than before the swap. August registration was 990 yuan, September was 986 yuan. Morning water replenishment was 990 yuan, and afternoon water replenishment was 987 yuan. The price of pure gold was 996.3 yuan. The swap market initially opened with buyers bidding 3.5 to 4 yuan. Spot number Yingfenghang suddenly sold, falling, and Guangbang Shengda also sold, with a score of a thousand taels (divided and written by Yuqingyong Hengxing, etc.). The situation fell miserably, falling to 2.5 yuan. Chunyuan Yong Fuyu Wanxing worked hard to post and pull up the shape, Hongli and others came to post out, and rose to three yuan eight or nine jiao. After entering, the transaction was calm, and the situation was also flat, generally around three yuan and a half. In the afternoon market, Dadecheng posted 133 taels to Shunli for three yuan six jiao, and there were extremely many other transactions. Therefore, Fuchang's surplus suddenly increased. The spot market was stable, but due to swap relationship, adding water was more expensive, Tianjin goods were calculated at 14 yuan and two jiao flat, Dongbei goods were calculated at 12 yuan 7.5 jiao, transaction was flat, spot number was still buying, the remaining number of August taels was 17,528 taels, with a total of 11 long positions, and 33 short positions.</p>
<p>The transaction in the market was flat, the overall water interest Yicheng Yuqingyong Yiyu Zhaofengchang Hengyu Wuyuan Maoyong Yifengyong Xianghe Dingtai Tongchun Dingchang Shenkang Yingfenghang Senchangyong Tianfengyong Bingxing etc. were on the buying side, and Wanxing Yuanchun Dingkang etc. were on the selling side. Qingfayong Huishi Shuide advanced and exited, Dingtai Tianfeng Yuanyi exited first and then entered, Dalian gang Wanxing jointly did more than 1,500 taels, and crushed out more than 500 taels, Shunli jointly did around 1,700 taels, and crushed out more than 300 taels. Guangbang Shengda entered and exited little, and Hengxing was the same. The September contract had 33,026 taels, a total of 40 long positions and 59 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 29,869 taels in the morning and 15,232 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Overseas Market Quiet; Exchange Market Also Calm</h3>

The US silver market was also flat, and there was no market for deferred silver prices. The English exchange rate versus the US was unchanged, the US versus the English rose by 25, the English versus the French was unchanged, and the US versus the French rose by 125.

The opening in the morning was a recent selling price of 1 shilling 4 pence 1875 for English exchange and 34.125 yuan for US exchange. Compared with last Saturday, the English exchange was flat and the US exchange was loosened by .0625. After the opening, the market tightened, and although the bank's appetite was still selling, Chinese merchants bought. HSBC's listing was announced, and the English and US exchange rates were still unchanged. Sentiment was stable, and the process gradually became tighter, but banks still had a supply at high prices. In addition, the situation was very flat. Sassoon closed the shilling, and there were no special changes in the domestic market. In the afternoon market, banks slightly sold deferred US dollars in addition to doing the shilling, and the situation was calm and slightly loose. However, because Mumbai telegraphed a decrease of 1.2 anna, it was still stable. When the market closed, the recent selling price was 1 shilling 4 pence 1875 for English exchange and 34 yuan or .0625 for US exchange. Compared with before the swap, the English and US exchange rates were both flat, but the US dollar in August and September was slightly separated, and the potential was looser. Chinese merchants bought about 200,000 yuan in US dollars, and Sassoon closed the shilling. Now I will record the day's transactions.</p>

<h3>Smooth Clearing in the Banking Industry at the Beginning of the Week</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and the banking industry's market conditions improved because they had to make up for the unfinished procedures from the end of last week. The silver market also improved by 1 point, and both the morning and noon markets traded at 5 points. However, adding water to the clearing was ultimately just for show due to the abundance of silver, and clearing transactions were not as leisurely as they had been in recent days. The early market had more than 4.0 million in transfers and new transactions, the noon market had more than 200,000 transactions, and the small general association had more than 400,000 transactions. In the silver mortgage loan transactions, more than 900,000 were redeemed and more than 1.2 million were newly made. In the bank clearing, the procedures were unusually cumbersome, with foreign merchants clearing more than 3.0 million in bills, various goods and exchange loans and miscellaneous items clearing more than 4.7 million in bills, foreign exchange clearing more than 800,000, and 400,000 in warehouse departures.

<h3>Securities and Scattered Investors Emerging Over Several Days: The Bond Market Feels Increasingly Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, there were more political rumors circulating in the market. Sellers were more numerous, market prices were weak and felt quite sluggish. Furthermore, many scattered investors who had been bullish were emerging over the past few days. The appetite of buyers was relatively weak, and temporarily there seemed to be an oversupply. Therefore, the market was slightly sluggish. At the opening yesterday morning, issues No. 11 and No. 16 were heavily sold, with market prices uniformly falling by ten to twenty cents to around one dollar. Issue No. 96 also fell by about one dollar. This was entirely due to repeated pressure from speculators. A rebound should not be far off. In the second session, there continued to be selling of issue No. 11, while issues No. 4, No. 46, and No. 53, among others, saw significant buying. Initially, market prices continued to weaken by thirty to fifty cents. From the salt tax issue onwards, there was a uniform rebound of thirty to fifty cents. Market prices varied due to the competition between bulls and bears, and the future remains uncertain. As a result, market prices fell by several cents to over one dollar. The total turnover was estimated to be around 15 million yuan. The details of price increases and decreases are listed below (in yuan):</p>

<h3>Difference Between Near-Term and Forward Cotton Yarn Gradually Widening</h3>
<p>▲ Bulls Tend Toward Forward Contracts: No Intention to Take Delivery This Month</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly weak due to a slight drop in American cotton. Bullish investors are taking profits, causing the market to loosen. Moreover, those taking delivery this month are still lacking. Although sentiment is good, there are not many buyers for near-term contracts, and interest is solely focused on forward contracts. Therefore, the price gap between near-term and forward contracts is widening. Given this situation, arbitrage will still be the only way to make profits in the future. The yarn market’s current situation makes it difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Demand for Auctioned Yarn Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>At the opening of the auctioned yarn market, the atmosphere was calm, and buying interest was also stable. However, foreign cotton fell slightly, and all months also dropped by twenty to thirty cents. By the second auction round, bulls were still raising prices for forward months, but this still failed to attract buyers. The third round remained flat and weak. As a result, all months fell by fifty, sixty, and seventy cents. The total transaction volume was 21,700 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 1,800 bales, Hengyi 700 bales, Zhenda 500 bales, Gengfeng 1,850 bales, Junchang 1,000 bales, Xiecheng 500 bales, Xiesheng 600 bales, and Deji 700 bales. Jinchang bought 600 bales, Shenchang 1,050 bales, Dafu 650 bales, Shenji 1,200 bales, Yichang 550 bales, and Changfeng 1,050 bales, Yongda 1,050 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Auctioned Yarn | High Price | Low Price | Closing Price | Increase/Decrease | Inventory |</p>

<h3>Sales of Spot Yarn Still Good</h3>
<p>It was found that various guilds purchased a total of 1,278 bales throughout the day. Prices were flat. The purchase volume of each guild is listed below:</p>
<p>Shantou 125, Guangdong 270, Jiangxi 55, Wuhu 20, Fujian 8,</p>
<p>Sichuan 300, Yunnan 80, Inland 220, Northern Guild 100</p>
<h3>Sudden Drop in Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>The cotton market suddenly dropped, and the situation softened again. This was because the rise at the end of last week was too violent. Many expected American cotton to rise, but the telegrams received were flat and weak, leading to short-term profit-taking. At the same time, market news indicated that there had been occasional showers in outer ports recently, which had significantly helped the cotton fields. As a result, the market weakened. However, general speculators are optimistic about the future of American cotton, buying on dips and aggressively adding to their positions. However, it is said that Japanese firms have been acting very little recently.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao (Cotton) Retreats by Thirty to Forty Cents</h3>
<p>At the opening of the auctioned cotton market, prices suddenly fell because American cotton had turned down by ten points, and the rise at the end of last week was too frantic. Also, the weather turned cooler, and the sky was filled with floating clouds in the morning, indicating a high chance of rain. As a result, sentiment loosened, and selling started slightly, causing prices to plummet. Moreover, a long position company for old cotton turned bearish and talked about delivering goods, making the market even weaker. Forward months also weakened. However, speculators are optimistic about American cotton and buy on dips to add to their positions. In general, new cotton prices are high, so those with goods will naturally sell. Therefore, in the era of new cotton, it cannot completely follow foreign cotton. All months of auctioned cotton fell by 0.34 to 0.45 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 113,900 dan. It was found that Huikang sold 4,200 dan, Changfeng 3,100 dan, Yifeng 2,400 dan, Chong'an 3,000 dan, Xinheng 1,200 dan, Shenji 2,100 dan, Dafu 1,200 dan, Ruidi 1,200 dan, Gengfeng 12,500 dan, Suilong 1,400 dan, Meiji 5,900 dan, and Jifeng 1,300 dan. Dafeng bought 5,800 dan, Yukang 2,200 dan, Yuanda 1,800 dan each, Jinchang 2,100 dan, Mingde 1,050 dan, Junchang 2,100 dan, Yuanda 3,100 dan, Renfeng 5,900 dan, Tongxing 1,200 dan, Taichang 1,400 dan, Yichang 2,500 dan, Changfeng 5,600 dan, Runkang 4,600 dan, and Dachang 1,300 dan.

<h3>Spot Cotton Arriving and Selling Quickly</h3>
<p>The spot cotton business is flat because there is still ample spot supply in the market. Factories are not actively buying. The source is estimated to be 120 bales of Yao cotton. The opening prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet Cotton 45.00, Hongzhang Factory: 100 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Import Statistics for June</h3>
<p>According to a survey by Gaoerting Foreign Firm, the import volume of foreign cotton in Shanghai in June is recorded below:</p>
<p>American Cotton 19,135 bales, Burmese Cotton 2,799 bales</p>
<p>Indian Cotton 14,408 bales, African Cotton 1,300 bales</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton 1,410 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Fields Decrease, US Cotton Rises by 100 Points Last Week</h3>
<p>New York, July 13th, telegraphed the cotton market situation last week, saying that an unexpectedly favorable cotton field report for the bulls caused cotton prices to rise by about one point per pound. However, the cotton market eventually retreated slightly due to profit-taking and selling in the South. Although speculative demand is still active, purchases by the trade are relatively flat. The actual position of the cotton market can now be considered slightly weak, as accumulation has been quite heavy recently. Spot demand in the South has also not improved significantly. The cotton field report has provided the trade with a solid basis for calculating possible production. The most important factor in the future is the weather. Temperatures in Texas remain abnormally high, and the north and west urgently need rain. It is heard that in drier areas, cotton crops have deteriorated. However, in areas with favorable weather, cotton crops have made progress. Cotton crop conditions elsewhere are mostly either good or fair. Although there have been showers in the Gulf states of the eastern United States, there have been no reports of significant increases in boll weevil. The cotton market is slightly firmer than before, and cloth factories are now raising prices.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Market Prices Rise Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the cotton market rose because the government cotton field report in the US showed reduced cotton fields. Before the new cotton moves, the market situation will favor buyers. Export inquiries vary, with Europe being quiet and Japan being more active than before, especially for Central Indian Gandhi and Lijas cotton. The weather is very good, and various places have started ginning preparations. The appended statistics for last week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>|                | 1933  | 1934  |</p>
<p>|----------------|-------|-------|</p>
<p>| Cumulative Receipts from September 1st | 2,408 | 2,308 |</p>
<p>| Current Stock at the End of the Period  | 858   | 996   |</p>
<p>| Cumulative Exports from September 1st  | 1,523 | 1,333 |</p>
<p>| Exports to Europe| 354   | 356   |</p>
<p>| Exports to China | 99   | 48    |</p>
<p>| Exports to Japan | 1,034 | 900  |</p>
<p>| Exports to Other Places | 26  | 19  |</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>▲ Transaction Volume Greatly Increased: Forming a Short Squeeze</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months showed a huge rise again, and the prosperity of transactions was unprecedented in recent years. The volume in half a day reached a huge 1.89 million bags. The chaos and disorder in the market were also the first in several years. When opening prices were set, due to domestic and foreign situations, either continuous rain caused disasters, or droughts exerted their power. Therefore, the excitement of the people was an inevitable fact. In addition, grain prices in the north were expensive due to water and drought imbalances. It was said that the spot price in Tianjin had increased to six cents, opening at 2.23 to 2.28 yuan. Therefore, the opening price for this month was 26 cents, and then gradually increased, forming a short squeeze. Factories are preparing themselves, and outside short sellers are also rushing to cover, so the highest squeeze was to 29.5 cents. The rise in prices for forward months was certainly also crazy, but many bullish investors were taking profits at high prices, and factories were also selling. Although transactions were also very prosperous, the increase was only ten to twenty cents. This situation was caused by natural disasters. If Heaven favors us and sweet rain comes, then the huge terror may be slightly suppressed. Otherwise, the potential is very large, and there is little opportunity for loosening. As a result, it rose 5.5 cents compared to the previous week, 2.75 cents in August, 2.5 cents in September, 1.75 cents in October, 2.5 cents in November, and 2 cents in December.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures See a Small Reversal</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a trend of first rising and then falling. The quoted price of foreign wheat was only about ten to twenty cents better. After the opening prices were set, due to frequent reports of worsening domestic and foreign disasters, the sentiment inside and outside the industry became optimistic again. All months were better by three to five cents compared to the previous week. By the second round, because large bullish investors emerged, the situation suddenly changed, and speculative long positions also took the opportunity to sell. Therefore, all months went from high to low. This situation was actually a small reversal since the aggressive rise. As a result, this month was down a small 3 cents, August and September were up 1 cent, October was up 2 cents, November and December were unchanged. Due to the soaring prices of flour, customers were very eager to sell spot wheat. The opening prices for each grade were up five to six cents again. The opening price for Xuzhou wheat was 3.232 yuan, Wuhe wheat was 3.23 yuan, secondary wheat was 2.23 yuan, Linhuai wheat was 2.28 yuan, Wuhu wheat was 3 yuan, Chuzhou wheat was 3.26 yuan, Liuhe wheat was 3.20 yuan, Jiangxinzhou wheat was 3.15 yuan, Daqiao wheat was 3.20 yuan, Yaowan wheat was 3.27 yuan, and Qingjiang wheat was 3.25 yuan. Fuxin bought 12,000 bags, Fufeng bought 8,000 bags, and Xinda bought 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Newly Contracted ▲ 4.15 Yuan Per 100 Jin ▲ Foreign Rice Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of foreign rice first saw people feeling very panicked because the drought in the south had already occurred, and the north had suffered a flood again. The inland and hoarding households on this street became even more eager to buy, and the market price of Jijing rice rose to 9.4 yuan. The prices of all other types of rice also increased. Then, because the soybean and rice industry had already restricted rice prices and made a resolution to order foreign rice, and even planned to request the elimination of foreign rice taxes, the sentiment in the market turned downward. It was heard that various rice shops had urgently contracted with foreign merchants to immediately load 100,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice (some say the first batch was 5,000 tons, and the second batch has not yet been decided). The contracted price was 4.15 yuan per 100 jin in national currency, with tariffs and water transport fees added separately. In total, calculated at 150 jin per sack, the combined price should be below 10 yuan. This price is already close to the current market price. If rice prices rise further in the future, or if taxes can be reduced or exempted, then the contracting parties can profit. After hearing this news, the appetite of buyers in the market weakened. The Xiaojiao rice, which had been rising for days, immediately fell from 8.8 yuan to 8.5 yuan. Once sentiment stabilized, the market price also decreased slightly. A total of 12,000 bags of rice were offered on the market, mostly bought by shops on this street, with northern and inland regions buying a little over 1,000 bags each.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Fall After Price Controls</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, each guild had only 17 or 18 source vessels (a total of 2,600-2,700 stones of goods). Since the price controls were imposed once, market sentiment has turned flat. Only the Weihaiwei guild bought 600-700 bags. The market for special late rice continued to show a downward trend. The prices of Changbang Sutong Nangang and other japonica rice and Qingjiao Songsi Xilian and other late rice fell again by ten to twenty cents. Only Du Yangjian and Bianyuan and other types of rice with scarce supply still saw a stable situation.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from the various rivers was 12 or 13 vessels. The appetite for various goods in the market was normal. Early japonica rice was slightly traded. Baiyuan and various pointed rice were sold in small quantities. Except for a small drop in the price of white japonica rice, the prices of other goods did not fluctuate much.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang New Soybeans Suddenly Rise by Twenty Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of yellow soybeans was unchanged from the end of last week, but the demand was not weak, and sentiment stabilized. It is estimated that factories bought about fifteen or sixteen carts of Yingzhou beans and Bengbu beans. Small retailers on this street bought two carts of Zhengyangguan beans. The second batch of Jiujiang Xinchengmen soybeans arrived at the port yesterday. The quantity was small, and the quality was also inferior. A total of 214 bags arrived, causing distorted sentiment among buyers. They argued over prices, so the market suddenly rose by twenty cents to 3.40 yuan. The Ningbo guild bought them. According to people in the industry, the quality of soybeans yesterday was not good, and the market situation did not rise sharply.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Lanzhuzhi and Lanhua Seeds Debut</h3>
<p>The Lanzhuzhi and Wuyezhi produced in Zhangzhou this year are expected to be bountiful, and the costs are higher. It is difficult to set a price. It is said that the products this year are better than last year, so the Taikoo steamship imported a small amount for trial marketing yesterday. The total was less than 30 boxes. The cost of Lanzhuzhi is 40 yuan, and the cost of Wuyezhi is 26 to 27 yuan. If the quality is excellent, it may be possible to maintain a profit.</p>
<p>The number of new Lanhua seeds this year is not high. The first batch of over ten boxes arrived yesterday. The quality is still yellow and bright, but half of them are of lower quality. As the number is small, they should sell well.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Less Local Refined White Sugar Shipped</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market remained flat. The guild allocated a disk of 24 raw sugar white spot goods at the original price, but it was unsuccessful. The price of goods in this warehouse was 20 yuan, down 5 cents from the previous day. The price of transit goods was 6.4 yuan, and the price of Dutch red transit goods was 6.3 yuan. The price of Taikoo B mark was 20.4 yuan. Recently, due to the hot weather, most of the workers in this factory have stopped working, so there is a shortage of refined white sugar shipped. The original price of 19 yuan has not been widely offered. Yesterday, 400 bags of Hainan red sugar were opened, with high-grade sugar at 13 yuan and secondary sugar at 12.7 to 12.8 yuan. Dozens of bags of high-grade refined red sugar were opened at 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Silk Sales Frequent and Smooth</h3>
<p>▲ New White Filature Silk Transported to Hangzhou: Silk weaving merchants in Hangzhou purchased a significant amount of new white filature silk in Shanghai after the new cocoons came on the market. Various manufacturers reeled and unravelled them one after another and transported them to Hangzhou in batches. In the first half of this month, a total of 135 bales of new cocoon white filature silk were transported to Chang'an Changshanmen stations to meet the needs of the machines, all of which were B grade 20-22 denier.</p>
<p>▲ New Re-reeled Silk Transported to Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Huzhou: This year's spring cocoons were abundant. Because the price of fresh cocoons was low, many silkworms spun their own native silk. The native silk collected by silk shops in Xun (Nanxun) and Zhen (Zhenze) was re-reeled by various weaving households to make large re-reeled dry silk and transported to Shanghai to sell to foreign firms. Because there has been no rain for a long time since the beginning of summer and the inland river water is shallow, transportation by wheel is difficult. Therefore, the re-reeled silk stored in various producing areas is now being rushed to Shanghai in batches. In the past half month, 220 pieces of all grades of white dry silk have been loaded by small Shenhu ferries and stored in silk warehouses for sale.</p>
<p>▲ New York's Imports of Japanese Silk Remain Strong: Silk weaving factories in New York are on vacation due to the extreme heat, and the silk market is unusually quiet. Imports of Japanese silk remain strong. The current silk price has plummeted again. The standard Japanese silk is only offered at slightly over US$1.10 per pound, which is another drop of 400 yuan per bale in Chinese currency.</p>
<p>▲ Zhejiang's Summer Cocoons Have a Poor Harvest and Inferior Quality: Zhejiang's summer cocoon harvest this year is poor, and the cocoons are not thick. Few Shanghai silk merchants went to Zhejiang to buy summer cocoons. Yesterday, 74 jin of new model cocoons were transported from Haining to Shanghai and have now been sent to the factory for trial reeling. It is said that the baking yield is over 400 jin.</p>
<p>▲ American Firms Hoard Filature Silk: European and American firms in this port, seeing that New York's silk inventory is only enough for a little over a month of demand, and that the cloth factories will inevitably replenish raw materials after the summer vacation starts, and that the price of white filature silk has fallen to the lowest limit, are taking the opportunity to depress prices and buy. Those manufacturers with more cocoons in hand have to sell at a loss to maintain operations. It is estimated that Jardine and others bought 130 bales of Grade B new white filature silk, but the price is still not strong.</p>
<h3>Luzhuang Zhenmei Tea Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port saw brisk sales of Zhenmei silk tea from Luzhuang, but since the price of Wuyuan Zhenmei fell last week, British and French firms have been consistently stringent in their assessment of goods from Tunxi, Shexian, and other Luzhuang areas, successively offering new low prices. For example, the price of Tunxi goods was reduced to 95 yuan, the price of Suian goods was reduced to 80 yuan, and the price of Wuyuan East Road goods was reduced to 102 yuan. The market prices of other items such as Zhenmei Pearl Tea have also been looking to decrease. The green tea market does not present a good picture. As for Keemun and Ningzhou black teas, although transactions are slightly more active, the sales prices have been falling and not rising.</p>
<h3>Predictions for the Piece Goods and Woolen Fabric Market [Differing Opinions, Each with Their Own Reasons]</h3>
<p>The scorching heat of summer has caused a lull in the woolen fabric trade in May and June. People in the industry are paying close attention to the new market in the autumn and winter, making mutual predictions. For the same goods, some see a rise in prices, while others predict a fall. For example, at the beginning, the general market was expected to rise, but recently it has been looking flat. The reason is that tariffs have been reduced, exchange rates have improved, and costs have become cheaper. In addition, after checking the spring overcoat materials, many Western clothing shops on this street have stored their inventory. The autumn market business will inevitably decrease. However, if merchants from other ports actively purchase, the market may rise accordingly. However, thin flannels, serge, Huate flannels, and other items are being dumped by Japanese imports, and the market sentiment is difficult to turn around. Herringbone flannels and ordinary 4-5 yuan per yard overcoat fabrics are expected to see a good rise in the market in the second half of the year, as jodhpurs and overcoats have been discarded, and herringbone flannels are becoming popular (especially the 4-yuan shiny cloth is the most popular and widespread), and there are no Japanese goods woven. The above is just one type of argument in the market and should not be taken as a firm market view.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Talk</p>
<h3>More on the "Square Scarf" Mentality</h3>
<p>— Ah Long</p>
<p>Previously, I saw an article titled "The 'Square Scarf' Mentality" in this newspaper's supplement, which stirred my thoughts. It led me to believe that if our nation were to perish, it would be, to some extent, related to this "square scarf" mentality.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I advocated for a "short clothing" lifestyle, proposing a significant improvement to men's attire. My reasoning was that since the Xinhai Revolution, there had been much talk about national benefits and people's welfare, but apart from cutting off queues, which indeed benefited the people, I saw little else that could be called national benefits and people's welfare. This made me think that since the Xinhai Revolution, women's clothing had undergone countless changes, becoming bizarre and extravagant, reaching the pinnacle of fashionable transformation (though excessively so). In contrast, men's attire still followed the old style of the Qing Dynasty, remaining unchanged (which was too conservative). Therefore, to awaken the national spirit and promote a simple life, we should first reform the clothing system. At the time, many people advocated for a style similar to Sun Yat-sen's student uniform, knee-length, and entirely made with Chinese tailoring methods. Its advantages were threefold: (1) convenient for walking, (2) saves fabric, and (3) avoids the inconvenience of dragging through mud and water in rain or snow. However, since its advocacy, many people have expressed support, but no one has actually implemented it. It's all just empty talk, causing a temporary stir, but producing no real effect.</p>
<p>Why is this the case? In a word, it's mostly due to the "square scarf" mentality. They would definitely think that if they changed their attire, they would feel embarrassed and uncomfortable if seen by others. Even they themselves would feel it's a loss of gentlemanly decorum. Wearing short clothes, they would feel unable to leave the house, and others would certainly say they are low-class and undignified. What kind of psychology is this? It's the "square scarf" mentality.</p>
<p>In ancient times, dissenting speech was prohibited, and dissenting clothing was punished. Today, we live in a world that values clothing over people. Long gowns and robes are considered dignified and precious. Therefore, even though scholars of the past constantly said "the scholar's hat has misled me," they ultimately refused to discard it. Today, look at those fortune-tellers and geomancers; no matter how tattered and dirty their long gowns and robes are, they would never remove that "square scarf" long gown. Even if a comrade in a long gown falls into dire straits, begging on the roadside, they would still stubbornly refuse to take off their long gown.</p>
<p>Why are they unwilling to take off these clothes? Because I am a superior person, I am a scholar, I am a respectable person. If I wear short clothes, I would lose my status and become a lower-class person. It's a kind of muddled concept of "starving to death is a small matter, but losing propriety is a grave one." I ask again, is the distinction between superior and lower classes really based on long or short clothing? If you are a person without character, no matter how beautiful or authentic your clothes are, you are still "lowly." But if you are a person with character, wearing short clothes wouldn't detract from your dignity. Furthermore, in this era of pragmatism, everything values practicality and eschews formalism. Why wear cumbersome long gowns and robes instead of convenient and fabric-saving clothes? Does removing a long gown really lead to a loss of status? In places like this, some people simply refuse to change. What else can be done?</p>
<p>Recently, Hitler in Germany issued eugenics laws, encouraging marriage and castrating those who are physically weak or have serious illnesses. His plan is solely for the purpose of strengthening the race. The reason why our country is not thriving is that there are too many friends with the "nose-wiping" and "square scarf" mentality. They are mostly thin, pale, weak scholars, mostly domestically produced. They are like the "young male leads" in dramas, wriggling and cringing, making people uncomfortable to watch. If our country is full of such people, even if other countries don't destroy us, we will destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>In the past, Columbus was willing to break an egg to discover a new continent. If the people of our country, in the current environment, don't break down these stubborn habits and class concepts, there is no hope for salvation. However, I also have a statement to make: simply taking off long clothes and putting on short clothes won't strengthen the nation or the body. We must refresh and revitalize all kinds of endeavors like clothing to have any hope of salvation. Otherwise, no matter how much the style of clothing changes, if the attitude of "nose-wiping" and "square scarf" mentality remains unchanged, it won't help.</p>

<h3>More on Crèches and Public Education</h3>
<p>— Shi Shi</p>
<p>(3) Can public education truly benefit children? This is a fundamental question. A parent's love is the sustenance of a child's life. This theoretical point has been discussed in detail in the previous article. However, when we observe the facts, we see that when children are taken away from their families and placed in public education institutions, the result is "the extinction of vitality and the degradation of natural instincts," harming both their physical and mental well-being. The mortality rate of children in Moscow's public education system that I cited earlier is based on the Englishman Hamilton's new book (Memories of Soviet Russia, 1931 edition, distributed by [unclear text]). If Mr. Jiu doubts this, it seems rash. In fact, such examples are too numerous to list. For example, in the book Sociology and Modern Social Problems by the famous American sociologist Charles Ellwood, the mortality rate of children in Paris' public education system is three to four times higher than that of ordinary children. This book is essential reading for those studying social sciences and women's issues and should be even more credible and reliable. Furthermore, the impact on children's spirits and personalities when they leave their families is particularly alarming. According to a 1909 report from 34 government-run juvenile reformatories in the United States, 29 percent of the recalcitrant children admitted were from divorced parents, 32 percent were from incomplete families, and 37 percent were from parents who had committed crimes. Most of these children were abandoned by their parents at a young age and had no home to return to. Conversely, in happy families with both parents, child criminals accounted for less than 1 percent. Furthermore, according to a survey by the Bosted Reformatory in England, more than 90 percent of the residents were homeless orphans. Most surprisingly, children from foster homes and poor children's homes also accounted for more than 27 percent. This shows how important family life and parental education are to children. It is easy to imagine whether public education benefits children.</p>
<p>As for crèches organized under the principle of "public education for children," only the Soviet Union has them at present. Their crèches do not "substitute for parental care" but only provide "foster care." They take "mothers feeding their own children" as a necessary condition and, strictly speaking, do not conform to the original purpose of "public education." In European and American countries, most of them are substitute childcare facilities established under the protection of religious groups and have a charitable nature, which are actually just improved infant homes. I don't know what Mr. Jiu's so-called "reality" is based on. Recently, there has been a labor crèche in our city, which I do not oppose. I remember that the "Rites of Zhou" records: "The Grand Steward uses care and nourishment to nurture all the people, and one day he will care for the young." During the Yuanhe period of the Tang Dynasty, an edict was issued: "Infants without relatives or those who have children but cannot afford to raise them will be provided for." The substitute childcare institutions created under this purpose are, of course, worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of July 14th</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>In the past two days, a common feeling has been revealed on people's faces. The noble people would not have any different feelings, but the working people would!</p>
<p>It's really disappointing to learn from the widespread rumors that there is no hope for this year's "Lantern Festival" again. However, there's no need to mind it; there will always be some excitement.</p>
<p>If you have time to go to the mysterious streets with exotic flavors after the lights are turned on, you will be able to get some stimulation. The pace will naturally be different; the hurried pace shows urgency, the slow pace shows leisure, and the unhurried pace symbolizes the harmony of their mood! As for the posture, of course, it will not be the same either; calm, gentle, inclined... in short, it is countless.</p>
<p>Cars should also come to respond to this great opportunity; convertibles, sedans, sports cars... here, it is not limited to being shiny and bright; even if you drive a dilapidated old car, following the back of the large team will attract attention.</p>
<p>Look, the bright red torches have lost their usual authority, silently hiding in front of the store door, gasping for breath. In the store, the goods are linked together and stitched into very small national emblems and flags, fluttering in front of the house and in the waist of the tree.</p>
<p>Outside the A.K. Soda Fountain, several blue-eyed women are talking and laughing, eating cold drinks, and an intoxicating fragrance blows over, and the working people are stunned.</p>
<p>It's very difficult to squeeze onto the tram, and the heat flow of people is spreading. I guess everyone feels a little distressed? Many people are sighing.</p>
<p>Oh, what's the matter? What's so good about foreign lights? Haven't you seen enough of your own lights at home? the ticket seller said impatiently.</p>
<p>Indeed, what's so good about foreign lights? How do you feel after seeing them? Oh, don't think so much! Now is the time to evolve into a great harmony. If you don't go to see them, it would be really disappointing to build so many lanterns.</p>
<p>The tram doesn't move forward as smoothly as usual; it stops after only a few steps, which is very annoying. The short section of the Eight Immortals Bridge will take 45 minutes. Needless to say, the crowd is even more crowded under the archway lights.</p>
<p>That's right, today the French Park is very lively, but after all, it's a French park! However, in any case, it has a kind of power, attacking everyone's heart. Here, I also went in.</p>
<p>The red and green lights flashing on the trees and in the center of the road are like stars, squeezing their eyes everywhere. The grass is full of people, men, women, and even crying children. On the sidewalks, the crowd is surging like tides. Hey, look! China's population is really prosperous, so prosperous that it can destroy all the construction projects being built in the park and make the neat flowers and trees a mess. This is only a fraction of what's happening in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Leaving the side door, a gust of hot wind swept over, which was very stuffy. Looking to the north, a red light was dyed half the sky.</p>
<h3>Whip Marks</h3>
<p>— Jenny</p>
<p>Standing painfully in front of the tap, touching the many purple-red whip marks on her arm!</p>
<p>This was just whipped by the master with that leather whip. But when he thought of the leather whip, his nerves suddenly jumped in fright, as if the leather whip was still whipping him; at the same time, the original purple-red whip marks felt faintly painful.</p>
<p>He still didn't know why he was so cruelly whipped by the master with a leather whip. In fact, he didn't think he had done anything wrong today to deserve such a heavy punishment! And he has always been diligent and organized in his work, and no one has ever hated him!</p>
<p>He is an apprentice in the × Barber Shop! Being an apprentice is simply being a vent for the master!</p>
<p>His father is a chauffeur in a mansion, and his family lives in the Yangshupu area. His mother works as a female worker in the nearby × factory. Because the wages that the two of them earn from their sweat and blood cannot maintain the bread for the whole family, they have to entrust relatives and friends to recommend their son to the × Barber Shop as an apprentice!</p>
<p>Naturally, parents know how much their son suffers from the master, but what's the use of knowing? Although it's painful, at least he won't go hungry for three meals a day!</p>
<p>Therefore, although he was whipped by the master's leather whip today, he felt that it was ten thousand times better than being hungry, because in the year before he entered this barber shop, he had been hungry for two days before he could eat a big cake. However, this pain is really unbearable! He instinctively looked at the whip marks on his arm!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the master ran out, still with a stern face, stood in front of him, and nagged: "What are you doing standing here all the time? Do you want to be whipped again? Go sweep the hair on the floor outside clean! Are you still not leaving?..."</p>
<p>So he lowered the two arms full of purple-red whip marks, left the tap, and mechanically ran outside.</p>
<h3>Pulling</h3>
<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>On a noon of more than 100 degrees, the sun softened the asphalt on the road, and I walked across the street in a hurry.</p>
<p>The asphalt on the street was soft. When the traffic light turned green with the whistle in the patrolman's mouth, the stagnation of cars and people began to move hurriedly and foolishly. Following behind a large string of cars, I saw many people pulling a large truck loaded with many steel bars with all their might. The people pulling were bare-chested, and their skin should have been dark brown. However, under the flames of the sun in this iron smelter, they sweated, and there was no chance to wipe it off. Their bodies were drenched with water, and shone like metal under the sun. Using force, using force! Isn't this tension of bronze muscles a manifestation of strength? Pulling the rope, the rope as thick as a carrying pole was wrapped around the shoulders, and as they pulled, it half sank into the flesh. A deep groove was carved out of the shoulders and back. Several people, all like that, leaned forward with all their might, forming an acute angle with the ground, desperately, and looking at the green light of the traffic light, anxiously fearing that it would turn red and they would not be able to cross the street. In this way, everyone looked at each other (agreeing), each person)</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>shouting "Pull!" "Pull!" from their mouths, and the clumsy truck moved foolishly.</p>
<p>An impression flashed like lightning: "What a difficult struggle for survival!"</p>
<p>Forgetting the heat of the sun, I stood in the hot sun, watching them struggle across the street in the green light of the traffic light.</p>
<p>And the cars on the street were still moving foolishly, but I felt as if I was pulling some clumsy thing, feeling a kind of weight, a kind of force, hanging behind me. But just like that, I desperately pulled my own life and walked many difficult roads from the dangerous and boiling road. Undoubtedly, I am still running on a difficult road, and when this difficulty falls on our generation, I am afraid that the face of the future reality will make us even more afraid. However, what does it matter? Let the burden behind us increase as much weight as possible, let the road become more boiling, more steep, and more dark; when the instinct of survival is pushing us from behind, and the purpose of survival is pulling us from the front, what does the steepness of the road and the hardship of labor matter to us?</p>
<p>Looking at the coolies pulling the cart, the manifestation of strength enlightened me. Every struggle is not a pleasant thing, but when suffering, they know to shout "Pull!" (agreeing) to the people who are standing on the same direction and pulling each other, and this shout, among them, will undoubtedly be a kind of permission for common cooperation and comfort for mutual assistance. They keep shouting and clamoring on the road; and I understand that because of this mutual permission and comfort, they have the courage to step on difficult steps.</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>Can a Vocation Provide a Living?</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>Women are pitiful! Especially the semi-new and semi-old Chinese women! After my parents died, I have two younger brothers and one younger sister. My family is naturally poor, but I don't need to say that. I just want to talk about my own problems and ask for your guidance.</p>
<p>I am twenty-one years old this year! I have studied in junior high school, high school, and private school; but I don't have a graduation diploma. Shackled by qualifications, I can't find anything to do. As a last resort, in this environment, I worked as a shop assistant for half a year, living a life of selling my face, so to speak. This kind of job will definitely not be stable when I get older. People like me who are melancholy and sick are getting old very quickly. Therefore, I should plan for my lifelong plan:</p>
<p>It just so happened that a gentleman often came to the store to buy things. From acquaintance to acquaintance, he became acquainted with me. He is very good to me, two years older than me. He graduated from a domestic university and works in an agency. His monthly salary can be more than a hundred yuan. He is very interested in marrying me, and even swore an oath of love to me, saying that he would never abandon me. But later, when he talked about him being already married, I fainted to the ground and was at a loss!</p>
<p>He said: "He will definitely not let me down, but how can the crime of bigamy be good?" I become his concubine, and there is no such provision in law. I am not very willing to be a mistress! That's even worse! Therefore, I ended up with no home to return to and no way to go! He finally comforted me and said, "He is from Guangdong and is about to return to Southeast Asia. If he goes to the United States, he will get a master's degree in one year and will definitely marry me when he comes back." Now my living expenses are all supplied by him, because when I was very passionate with him, the store was abandoned and I was fired. He wants me to go back to school and set a two-year deadline to learn a vocation that can support myself. I think about it again and again, can a vocation provide a living? Can I succeed in two years? Calling me to make a living on my own must mean that I am breaking off relations with me; or that I am still connected. But living this kind of shameless life, what is the joy of being born into the world? When I bring up the marriage issue again, he and his wife have feelings that cannot be divorced. I absolutely refuse to be the kind of unvirtuous woman who steals love. "One wrong step will cause eternal regret." I can't marry, I can't recruit, and there are really many differences between pitiful women and men. Freedom is what we all sacrifice our lives to demand, and freedom is also the path to our depravity. I am afraid that my problem can only be solved by the tracks on the railway and the long flow of the Huangpu River! But maybe the gentleman has a better way, so please teach me and let me follow. I am really very grateful. Best wishes for</p>
<p>good health! Chen Yonglian bows</p>
<p>Answer: I carefully read your letter and feel that you still regard marriage as entering a "sustenance institute," where both material and spiritual life must be resolved through marriage. There are indeed many people who hold this kind of "parasitic" mentality. It's no wonder you feel that way. Under the current social relations, women are forced to be parasites. However, because of this, you feel that your "lifelong plan" cannot be arranged, and that "only the tracks on the railway and the long flow of the Huangpu River" can solve the problem for you. In fact, your experience, although pitiful, is not necessarily a dead end. As long as you have the courage and independent spirit to do things, your problem is very easy to solve.</p>
<p>Although that college student's association with you may not have pure intentions, it is inevitable that he has a bit of a psychology of playing with women and seeking his own carnal satisfaction. Now, maybe he really wants to "break off relations" with you, but he still hopes that you will spend two years to learn a vocation that can support yourself. He is not as conscienceless as others. In other words, you have not met a liar, and your life has not been ruined in his hands. In my opinion, the reason for your distress is that you have underestimated yourself too much, so you have the questions "Can a vocation provide a living?" "Can I succeed in two years?" It seems that women cannot live without relying on their husbands. You must thoroughly eliminate this slave mentality, otherwise, even if you truly get what you call a home, you will only be a slave to others for the rest of your life. Although you have not obtained a formal diploma from school, you already have a high school education. Judging from this letter, your handwriting is very clear and neat, and your sentences are fluent and coherent. Even sloppy college graduates may not be able to catch up with you. Therefore, you are not a person without any foundation. If you have two more years to study, I guarantee that you can learn a specialized skill. Therefore, you are not afraid of not finding the qualification for a "able to live" vocation. I think the center of the problem is that you have to be reliable in doing things. Although he now allows you two years to study, I don't know if he can give you the tuition and living expenses for these two years. If not, you must ask him to give it to you all at once to avoid him changing his mind halfway. This is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Of course, the purpose of a woman marrying a husband, although now everyone thinks it is for "eating," is actually not so simple. Family life and desire for a spouse are human nature. However, the problem that most people cannot marry is still caused by economic reasons. If the economic problem is solved, there will be far fewer difficulties. If you are economically independent, it will be much easier for you to marry. Now, most wage earners hope to get a wife who does not have to bear economic responsibility. Even if you are very good to that college student, and you don't want anyone else, you can continue to maintain the relationship. Under the current circumstances, you must go through the marriage form to maintain it, but at that time, it is not necessary. The love between two people does not have to go through the marriage form to be maintained. Therefore, you are not a desperate person in terms of sexual life.</p>
<p>Your problem is not a problem. What has become a problem is that you don't want to treat yourself as a person and regard yourself as a parasite. Editor</p>

<h3>Revenge (2)</h3>
<p>— Translated from Hungarian by Youlibakiluo Jia</p>
<p>A four-wheeled carriage stopped at the gate of a street house. The mother was the first to get out and waited for her daughter. But the daughter remained motionless, as if she had no intention of following.</p>
<p>"We're home," the mother said in surprise.</p>
<p>"Good! I know: : : Go to sleep!"</p>
<p>"Welcome!"</p>
<p>To make the coachman not understand their conversation, the young lady said in French:</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is already the wedding day. I obey you, but today I am still free, and I still have to dispose of myself at will."</p>
<p>"What do you want to do?"</p>
<p>"I want to avenge myself: : : I want to come up with a true woman's revenge: : :"</p>
<p>The mother stared at her daughter in terror, guessing at that terrible result, and she cried out:</p>
<p>"You're crazy. What do you want to do?"</p>
<p>The young lady laughed, painfully but almost threateningly, said:</p>
<p>"I will tell you in the future: ...No, don't be afraid. I won't commit suicide, and I won't hinder the restoration of the basis of the property of my parents' enterprise. I just want to avenge myself: : :".</p>
<p>"But it's so late, where are you going? : : : You're crazy, you're completely crazy."</p>
<p>Instead of answering, the young lady gave the coachman an order:</p>
<p>"Hey, go back to the dance floor!"</p>
<p>The national carriage began to run. The mother desperately shouted, trying to stop them, but the young lady kept giving orders to the coachman.</p>
<p>"If you take me to Hilda Street very quickly, I can give you a lot of tip money."</p>
<p>"Not to the dance hall?"</p>
<p>"No! To Hilda Street! Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>The young lady opened the small window of the car and looked at her mother, who was following the car that had started running. The young lady mischievously protruded:</p>
<p>"Dear mother, don't run! I'll be home in an hour."</p>
<p>The wheels resounded on the street stones, and their voices drowned out the mother's reply.</p>

<h3>The Audience's Policy of Burying Their Heads in the Sand and the Masks Worn by Celebrities (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>American President Lincoln once said: "You cannot fool all of the people all of the time." This saying is mostly correct, but he didn't thoroughly understand human psychology. He didn't investigate how many people in the world are constantly trying to fool themselves, or deliberately asking others to fool them. If you awaken these people from their dreams or expose their illusions, they will grieve and mourn. There are no statistics on exactly how many such people there are in the world, but some people boldly say that all the gentlemen and ladies, just because they have a bit of money, are willing to buy pink-tinted glasses to wear. Emptiness, fantasy, and splendor are ways to escape reality. Although Soviet writers strive to depict reality, the masses still prefer to see the best, hear the best, and believe the best—even if those things aren't entirely true—especially about the idols they worship.</p>
<p>How mysterious is Greta Garbo, and how did she become so mysterious? It's actually quite funny. According to her confidants, on her first day in America, reporters came to see her, but because of the language barrier, she couldn't say a word, so she simply kept silent. They felt that this Swedish girl was extraordinary, so they gave her the title of "Mysterious Girl." This title was worth its weight in gold, and Greta soon realized it from her bank account. So she became even more mysterious. The audience, too, felt that the more mysterious she was, the better, so Greta had to maintain her mystery, because her position was built on this empty fantasy. Is Garbo really mysterious? I'm afraid there's more mystery in a beef patty. Now, if what's published in film magazines isn't mysterious enough, her fans will fill in the gaps with their submissions. The easiest way to incur public opposition is to declare that Garbo is no different from anyone else. She keeps one eye on the public's infatuation with her inexplicable mystery and the other on the booming ticket sales, secretly delighted.</p>
<p>Regarding the marital events of general celebrities, the public often harbors many fabricated fantasies about them. Take Ann Harding, for example. Since her divorce from her husband, Harry Bannister, her status has been greatly affected. This is because her previous publicity always mentioned how happy their marriage was, how they would grow old together, and how they were role models for all of Hollywood, etc. Of course, when the marriage later broke down and the truth was revealed, it was the day the illusions of her fans, especially housewives, were shattered. The divorce of Janet Gaynor and Lydell Peck was similar. Previously, everyone regarded Janet as a sweet, approachable girl. Then they all realized that Janet also had strange and stubborn sides. Therefore, her status was also significantly affected. Fortunately, she had a few good films that maintained her connection with the audience. However, it wasn't the general public who knew about Janet's various faults, but rather the Hollywood authorities. Not long ago, we heard news that a certain luminary in the film industry was about to divorce. We thought that since we were insiders, it would be fine to discuss the details with close friends. Who knew that after hearing the real story, they wouldn't even say thank you, but instead accused us of spreading rumors. One very clever bystander said, "Please don't talk about that kind of thing. I prefer to keep that fantasy intact, so it will never disappear, because that is the only way for me to escape the cruel reality." This is how the public prefers to bury their heads in the sand and avoid reality. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "King of the Wild Horses"</h3>
<p>— Wan Shi</p>
<p>"King of the Wild Horses" | Carleton</p>
<p>This is a film starring a horse.</p>
<p>Originally, this shouldn't be a strange thing. When a horse that can act is discovered, it's as if finding a dog that can act. The producers can regard it as a rare treasure, because they can use it to exploit the audience's curiosity. Rin Tin Tin or Tom Mix's horse—weren't they all once clever animals that caused a sensation?</p>
<p>Human bodies have already become commodities, let alone animals?</p>
<p>It is precisely because of this horse named Rex, precisely because this horse has amazing skills, that screenwriters, directors, and photographers are mobilized for this horse, and even many actors are directed to play supporting roles for it. Everything is very simple; everything is for a horse.</p>
<p>If you think that the impostor official's exploitation of the people is an exposure of the poor local political organization, then it is unreasonable and exaggerated. Western films often have this kind of plot.</p>
<p>We won't gain any new understanding from it. All we see are the horse's jumps and the bravery of the chief's son. As for film art, that's out of the question here.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "Fallen Souls"</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>"Fallen Souls" is the latest work of the Yueming Company. Although the content is still so immature and unable to satisfy us, in terms of form, there is indeed a lot of progress. This is a point that we should encourage in a small company.</p>
<p>Originally, amidst this socio-economic destruction, the instability of workers' lives has long become an undeniable fact. However, the reason for the instability of workers' lives belongs to the serious problems of the entire social organization, and is definitely not the demon (woman) who harms the soul as pointed out by the director. Although women are sometimes a kind of destruction of human life, the director here fails to point out the major reasons for the bankruptcy of workers' lives, and only uses a woman to represent everything, which is also suspected of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. At the same time, because the consciousness is inaccurate, there is naturally little powerful development in the plot. The overall impression given to the audience is nothing more than "women are not good things"!</p>
<p>The director's control skills are also insufficient, such as Mina's sudden arrival with boxes and no detailed introduction, such as Hu's wife moving and not informing Hu Fei in prison, and necessarily meeting after buying cakes, and many other loopholes. But there are also some very exciting places, such as the scene of Xiao Fei's storm during illness, which is very realistic. Especially using a broken umbrella in a leaky house, and writing back the dance umbrella in the ballroom, and using coffee in the ballroom to reflect Hu's wife's drinking roadside tea, these are all good techniques and worthy of praise. However, the darkness of the light is indeed the biggest stain on this film! (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Watching "Fallen Souls"</h3>
<p>— Hou Yimin</p>
<p>"Fallen Souls" depicts the romantic history of a courtesan. Indeed, in the story, it depicts the evils of the city, the extravagance, and everything else without reservation. It tells us that the city is so evil, and directs us to be safe and secure, right? Don't have any unrealistic ideas, otherwise, you will go astray, and you don't know what to do!</p>
<p>However, the writing of the script is too messy and too scattered. There is never a scene that can grab the audience's psychology and be extremely tense, but just a series of bland performances. As for the director's directing skills, it seems that it is not enough, so the performance of the whole play has no place for change, and it is always a series of the same shots.</p>
<p>Because most of the exteriors, such as the city and the countryside, are taken in the Shanghai area, the scenery is very economical, and there is not much scenery to be used. However, what disappoints us is that the scenery of several interior scenes seems to be too sloppy, and even has many illogical places.</p>
<p>The actors' performances are mediocre, and there is nothing outstanding. Because the plot is scattered, and the central characters in the play are scattered, it makes it impossible for everyone to perform fully. Comparatively speaking, it is Wang Feijuan, who plays Hu Fei's wife, and her performance is more profound. Generally speaking, the production of a small company, "Fallen Souls", can be said to be a domestic film at the horizontal level!</p>
<h3>Francis Ton's Romance</h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Up to now, Francis Ton has been in love twice. He has been engaged to his second partner for several years. However, because she is a very promising actress, if they get married, it will undoubtedly destroy her bright future, so he has to endure it, planning for her future, and separating from her.</p>
<p>Since this sad anecdote became known, Francis Ton has greatly gained sympathy from all sides, and his reputation has also increased because of this.</p>
<p>The identity of the female partner who has become a problem is still kept secret and not made public. But many people say that it is probably Sylvia Sidney.</p>
<h3>Liliane Hawe's "Emerging Lotus"</h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>This film "Emerging Lotus" [Love Never Again] uses satirical techniques to discuss the issue of male lust.</p>
<p>A group of men who have been wronged by women are really tired of beauty. With temporary courage, they ran to the sea together and vowed not to get close to the opposite sex anymore. At first, everyone sang the song "Farewell to Love" with a 12-point determination, but as the days passed, everyone gradually felt sexually hungry, so they often had fantasies, and one by one they were about to become crazy. At this time, by chance, they suddenly discovered a stunning beauty in a bathrobe on the sea. This delicate and tender emerging lotus, when seen by those men who crave women day and night, how could they not be moved? There's no need for me to go on about what happened next.</p>
<p>This film stars Liliane Hawe and is scheduled to be publicly screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater in this city on the 18th (Wednesday).</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Gossip</h3>
<p>— Bai Pin</p>
<p>Regardless of whether "sacrificing for art" is true or false, film critics should always forgive them. They often see in film reviews the subjective statement "××× does not hesitate to sacrifice her body for people:::" This is inappropriate, because although she has the right to "not want" to film a sensual scene (and only a few actresses can do so), the screenwriter and director are responsible. They are just pitiful people who are "powerless to resist"!</p>
<p>Of course, "sensual films" are not what the times need, and criticism is justified, but don't mistakenly knock the puppet's head. The accounting should be settled with the "behind-the-scenes people."</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Thirty-Day Princess (5)</h3>
<p>— Jin Que</p>
<p>Not only Spotswood and two policemen went to visit Mrs. Smith, but also many reporters followed. One of them, named Gilchrist, was a reporter from the Madison newspaper. When they followed there, Mrs. Smith told them that Nancy had been missing for several days. Gilchrist was a very shrewd reporter. He found a photo of Nancy in Nancy's house and showed it to Mrs. Smith, proving that it was Nancy herself. So he rushed back to his newspaper, convinced that he had received a unique and amazing message. "It turns out that Princess Catalina is not a princess at all," he told Madison. "The one in Grächen is a missing Nancy. She is an actress who is now impersonating a princess to help Grächen issue bonds!" Madison was still half-believing, and did not dare to fully agree. However, he also admitted that the photo that Gilchrist took was indeed very similar to Catalina. Later, he said to Gilchrist: "But I personally know the princess. Also, the princess came by boat, right?" Gilchrist said: "Although the princess came by boat, like before, she can also enter the quarantine island and not be able to land." So they discussed a discounted method. They first published a piece of news about Nancy's disappearance, and published a photo of her and a photo of a makeup box she had left in a nightclub the night before. They also drafted a news headline, vaguely pointing to many shady scenes and kidnapping situations inside. Madison also promised Gilchrist to try his best to prove that Princess Katherina was not a princess at all, but Nancy.</p>
<p>When the news was published the next day, and there was a photo of the princess's makeup life box, saying that it was Nancy's, Madison himself passed out several times. But he also had no way to think about it. That kind of nightclub fight::: actually involved the princess's Qingming::: it was really an incredible thing. Grächen was so angry that his face turned purple when he saw the news. He condemned Nancy, saying that she disregarded her position, had an affair with Madison privately, and ran into nightclubs with him, endangering all the tasks, and was also careless with the princess's private property, arbitrarily leaving it outside. But the matter was already so, and there was no way to recover it. So they decided to go on a trip to avoid the limelight for a while. Madison heard that the princess was going out for a trip, of course, he was reluctant and heartbroken, but when he went to the station to see her off, he suffered an unexpected pain. Because when the train was about to leave, a Duke Nicholas rushed to the station. Madison inquired that the Duke Nicholas was the princess's fiancé. Nicholas wanted to go out for a trip with the princess, but the princess didn't want him to go. They argued. Grächen was also not convenient to force Nancy. He also knew that Nicholas's mouth was very loose. He was afraid that going together would be detrimental to his plan. At this time, Gilchrist was also at the station. When he saw the dispute between Nicholas and the princess, he immediately surrounded Nicholas. He asked Nicholas many questions, trying to find out some real content, but he intentionally or unintentionally made Nicholas believe that the princess had changed, or that the princess was not the former princess, and it was not known.
